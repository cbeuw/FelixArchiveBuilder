O
n November 9th,
Sony Computer En-
tertainment Europe
announced that the
Playstation 2 had
become the best-selling computer
entertainment system in Europe.
Having sold 40 million units, it over-
took its predecessor by a few hun-
dred thousand units. David Reeves,
SCEE President and CEO, cited
that “the social gaming phenom-
ena such as EyeToy, SingStar and
BUZZ!” were a major factor in the
PS2’s success.
So, quick question here, what do
all these games have in common? If
you said that they all use peripher-
als, give yourself half a point. The
true answer is that they appeal to
a wider audience, so a more per-
tinent question would be: does a
game that appeals to a wider audi-
ence require a peripheral?
It must certainly help. Gaetan
Lee, one of the main organisers of
the science museum’s Game On
exhibition, told Stoic TV in a recent
interview “if you see a device that
looks like a guitar, you know what
you’re meant to do with it; you pick
up a microphone, you know what to
do with it.” In an industry where in-
put is generalised to something as
generic as possible, seeing some-
thing that’s familiar can be a real
incentive to give it a try.
Of course, that’s only one type of
peripheral. If you want full immer-
sion, you could always give Steel
Battalion’s controller a try. Involv-
ing two control sticks and around 40
buttons, including one for washing
the windscreen, it is one of the most
complicated gaming peripherals in
existence. My friend Tom and I had
a go on it at the aforementioned
exhibition and during a play, Tom
exclaimed “How do you get it to go
forward?” “You have to press one of
the pedals,” I said, to which he re-
plied in horror “there are pedals!?”
New breeds of control freak
Because real gamers don’t waggle joysticks all the time, explains Chris Hemmens
Out now
“Raiden, turn the game console off right now!”
Modern peripheral gaming grew
out of the success of Dance Dance
Revolution and other dancing
games as they made their transi-
tion from the arcade to the home in
1999. In the good old days, periph-
erals tended to come in the form
of either steering wheels or arcade
sticks. Guns also featured in the re-
tail sector, though they embodied
wilder designs, as owners of SNES’s
super scope can attest. Rhythm ac-
tion games caused a stir as a wider
variety of inputs were concocted.
Whereas steering wheels and the
like fit one model that could apply
to a genre as a whole, in the years
Felix Games knows a lot about you,
reader. We know what college you
go to, what your favourite student
paper is, and we also know exactly
what noise you make when given a
plastic guitar and a copy of Guitar
Hero II. It goes a little something
like this – “Weeeooooww weowow-
owowowwww.” and then you twid-
dle your left hand a bit. You get the
idea.
Yes, it’s expensive, and yes, you
might feel it a bit short-lived if all
you’re going to do is play it on your
own. But you’re never going to play
a game quite like Guitar Hero, and
the sequel is every bit as entertain-
ing as the first. One of the great-
est party experiences since Dance
Dance Revolution whilst drunk.
But we also know that some of
you are a bit too refined to be pranc-
ing around with what looks like a
demonic sex toy in your hands, so
for something more cerebral this
week, Warhammer: Mark Of Cha-
os finally makes a release. It’s not
the detail orgy that some fans may
be expecting, but an RTS that’s well
worth a look for those still waiting
for Supreme Commander.
Speaking of which, coming nearly
a month late for spooky season,
Rule Of Rose is out for the Playsta-
tion 2 this week. Set in 1930s Eng-
land and surrounding a group of
young girls called the “Red Crayon
Aristocrats”, RoR seems at first to
be usual horror fare, but the narra-
tive really does make a change from
the endless combat that Silent Hill
and Resident Evil are now plagued
with. And no – no, the group of girls
do not ‘get it on’. At all.
Though you may be interested to
know that Dead Or Alive: Extreme
Beach Volleyball 2 is still on track
for a Christmas release.
We’re just saying, is all.

More From Chris
Chris is one of the co-presenters of
Stoic TV’s Games Watch, a show
dedicated to gaming news and re-
views that airs once a week on the
Imperial TV station.
You can find an entire archive of
the show online at www.stoictv.com,
as well as catching the show every
Friday at various places around the
University. There’ll be more fea-
tures from Games Watch coming in
the future.
following DDR’s dancemat, we saw
the release of maracas, bongos,
guitars, microphones, keyboards
and even drumkits. Using music as
a universal language, new ways of
play found their place in the home
and new ideas began to perpetuate
in the minds of designers.
S
ony’s “Fire it up” cam-
paign in 2005 promoted
their SingStar, Buzz! and
Eyetoy IP very heavily,
and in the long-run has
been very successful. SingStar has
shipped all over the world and has
“You have to press the pedals.” ... “There are pedals?!”
Chris Hemmens at the weekend – Guitar Hero’s rock stylings are a big draw for those put off by geekery
just released its 7th incarnation
here in the UK. Eyetoy has reached
17 specifically designed titles to
date, and Buzz! already has 5 titles
dedicated to it despite only being
released in 2005, with a movie quiz
due for release in early 2007.
I finish with a look at the Wii. Is
it possible that the Wii controller
is the peripheral of all peripher-
als? You may have to swing it like
a tennis racket, use it as a samurai
sword, or even turn it like a steer-
ing wheel, but herein lies the prob-
lem: it’s designed to be as general
as possible. Looking back over the
insurgence of peripheral gaming
in the late 90s and early 2000s; are
we about to bear witness to the first
step in combining accessibility with
generality, and how will this affect
the outcome of the decisions that
the three major hardware manu-
facturers have made? Sony are
unerringly going to continue to
make add-ons for their machines,
it’s what they’re good at and why
they’re so popular. So that leaves
one final question; will Microsoft
lose that mass-appeal that comes
from everyday familiarity, or do
they have the charisma and online
audience to go the distance?
