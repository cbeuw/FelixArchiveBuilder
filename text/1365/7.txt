Remembering the Sudanese
On February 23rd 2003, a group
known as the Darfur Liberation
Front took public credit for an at-
tack on the Headquarters of the
Jebel Marra region in Sudan. This
is regarded as the beginning of a
conflict described by the outgoing
UN co-ordinator in Sudan, Mukesh
Kapila, as the “World’s greatest
humanitarian disaster”, but was
merely the side act at a time when
the Sudanese Government and
the international community were
engaged in drawing the north Af-
rican country’s second civil war
to a close at the ‘Navaisha show’
negotiations.
The area of Darfur has a popula-
tion of around six million, of which
approximately half are black Afri-
can. The other half are ethnically
Arab, and form the ruling govern-
ment. The cause of Sudanese inter-
nal conflict is generally attributed
to ethnic divisions and control over
vital natural resources as well as
the disparity in development be-
tween ‘outer’ regions such as Dar-
fur and the wealthier ‘Blue Nile’
area. One of the primary goals of
the black African rebels is to gain
greater ethnic representation in
Parliament and to have a Dafurian
Vice President.
The rest of 2003 saw the Sudan
Liberation Army and the Justice
and Equality Movement escalate
attacks on Government of Sudan
forces in the Darfur region. In April
of that year, 33 Landrovers were
used in an attack on an army gar-
rison which claimed the lives of 75
soldiers and military personnel, the
destruction of several bomber units
and the capture of 32 others, includ-
ing a General. This unprecedented
victory by an increasingly unified
rebel faction sparked a change in
the psychology and tactical ap-
proach pursued by the Govern-
ment regarding the emerging cri-
sis. With national troops positioned
in the south to maintain peace at
the end of the civil war, and in the
east protecting various important
infrastructure from other Eritrean
sponsored rebels, the defence of
the western province of Darfur was
then delegated to a militia group
known as the Janjawid.
The Janjawid had first come to
prominence in the suppression of
similar uprisings in 1996-1999, also
backed by the government, only
this time they were better equipped
and with more weapons, including
artillery.
With a mandate to stop the insur-
gency, the Arab paramilitary force
proceeded to wage a technologically
one sided war which has grown into
Bush’s Latest Visit
U.S. President George W. Bush
visited Indonesia on Monday, the
last stop of an eight-day post-elec-
tion Asia tour that included visits to
Singapore and Vietnam. Bush held
talks with Indonesian President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. He
heaped praises on Indonesia, con-
sidered a key US key ally in the war
against Islamic militancy.
“I admire your nation’s diver-
sity and its plurality. I admire your
president and his commitment to
reform and strengthening democ-
racy,” Bush told them with Yud-
hoyono at his side. Amidst the visit,
thousands of protesters ignored
monsoon rain and thunder to chant
anti-Bush slogans. Some protestors
held banners that read “Bush is a
terrorist!” and “You’re not welcome
here!”
President Bush was unruffled
and commenting on the protests
surrounding his visit, praised what
he said was a display of Indonesia’s
democracy. “People protest, that’s
a good sign,” he said. “It’s a sign of
a healthy society.”
At the joint press conference, he
said that he “applauds a society
where people are free to come ex-
press their opinion”. He continued,
“It’s to Indonesia’s credit that it’s
a society where people are able to
protest and say what they think.
And it’s not the first time, by the
way, where people have showed up
a humanitarian tragedy. The Jan-
jawid have been accused of murder,
loot, pillage, rape and mutilation.
By spring of 2004, over a million
people had been displaced fleeing
the violence with 100,000 crossing
into Chad, creating the worst refu-
gee crisis of recent times. Virtually
all of them were from the Fur, Mas-
saleit or Zagawa tribes and none
were of Arabic origin, making the
conflict appear racially motivated.
The current death toll as a direct
result of conflict today stands at
200,000, and in May 2004, Interna-
tional Crisis Group estimated a
further 350,000 people will die from
starvation and illness due to the re-
moteness of the Darfur region.
United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1564, passed in October
of 2004, set up an investigative unit
into Human Rights abuses in the
region. Resolution 1590 in March of
the next year acknowledged the se-
riousness of the situation and called
for the return of refugees to their
homes and more aid to get to the
affected populations. After the Dar-
fur Peace Agreement was signed
in May 2006, the UN passed an-
other Resolution, 1679, stating the
need for an accelerated UN peace
keeping plan, and called for 17,000
troops to replace the token and in-
effective 7,000 strong African Union
force. Even on the day of signing,
an attack involving 200 Janjawid on
camel back entered various villag-
es killing civilians and destroying
and looting property. The Sudanese
government maintains its opposi-
tion to a UN mission as a violation
of sovereignty, and describes the
situation as an ‘internal matter’.
The international community is
seen to have been reluctant to act
in a full and forceful capacity to end
the crisis. Although the UN inves-
tigative team reported have ‘mass
killings’, the official term of ‘geno-
cide’ was not attributed to the situa-
tion. Genocide would have demand-
ed action to be taken. Many argue
that the US interventions in Iraq
and Afghanistan have prevented
it from engaging in other conflicts
such as Sudan. There is suggestion
that a possible veto by permanent
Security Council member China
may have prevented a resolution
implementing a UN force because
of economics interests in the area.
Sudan Liberation Army troops
and Government of Sudan forces
may have, up until now, adhered
to such ceasefire terms in the May
Agreement, but the treaty has only
lead to a more factitious and cha-
otic situation with those unhappy
with the terms continuing to fight
unilaterally.
The last weekend saw a visit by
UN humanitarian chief Jan Ege-
land to the affected areas, but his
trip was cut short due to Khar-
toum restrictions and increasing
violence.
On Wednesday 15th November,
the government of Sudan is re-
ported to have launched major of-
fensives in the north Darfur area,
though it denies this. Foreign jour-
nalists are now being denied visas.
There are still 2 million displaced
persons in the western Sudanese
province, unable to return because
of continuing violence and lawless-
ness. African Union troops are also
unable to protect all the refugee
camps from Janjawid and Govern-
ment of Sudan strikes.
You know what? It may only be my
second week in the job but I’ve de-
cided to calm down for now; heck
maybe drop this column. I’ve de-
cided to follow the lead of the noble
Matthew Taylor, Tony Blair’s out-
going chief strategy advisor. This
week he commented that for all
its achievements, the Internet was
fuelling a “crisis” in today’s democ-
racy. Mr. Taylor claims that blogs
encourage “citizens to participate
in a shrill discourse of demands”
rather then more reasoned debate.
(Am I the only one worried by that
phrase? Are the Labour party plan-
ning to send us off to an alien planet
to fight big bugs to learn to be ‘True
Citizens’? It scares the living piss
out of me!). He also complained
that internet articles gave the im-
pression that “our leaders are out
there to shaft you”.
So this week I’m not going to be
cock-eyed about politics. Instead,
I’ll be straight-faced. Who’s a bet-
ter example to learn from about
reasoned argument that from our
dear leaders themselves? Take
the loveable, happy, go-lucky guy
David ‘Dave’ Cameron; who, in a re-
sponse to the Queen’s speech made
a drawn out and not at all imma-
ture attempt at humour with a joke
where the punch line called the La-
bour government: “a whiter shade
of fail”. I can feel my ribs breaking
as I write. I tried to contact Davey
afterwards to ask him to clarify his
position but he only replied with an
Internet clip of himself riding on a
bike, telling me that he’s ‘consider-
ing my letter which was very nice,
incidentally!’ (See? WebCameron
is a perfect example of how leaders
discuss policies fairly! The system
works!)
It was now time to contact La-
bour to discuss some of their fairer
policies; I had naïve hopes that this
would work, considering the famous
press conference last week when
our dear leader, Tony Blair, showed
an amazing example of leader-
ship by squirming out of denounc-
ing the death sentence of Saddam
Hussein (the evil scum-bag him-
self. Altogether now – Boo!). Bear
Learning from the leaders
and expressed their opinion about
my policies.” “That’s what happens
when you make hard decisions”.
Asked how he would comfort Mus-
lims who fear that his policies tar-
get them, Bush replied: “I believe
freedom is universal and democ-
racy is universal, I don’t believe it’s
the sole right of the United States,
or the sole right of Methodists.”
The US president added, some-
what ironically, “I believe the vast
majority of people want to live in
moderation and not have extrem-
ists kill innocent people.”
With security concerns para-
mount, Bush stayed only about
six hours in Indonesia. After din-
ner with Yudhoyono, Bush set out
for Hawaii, where he was to have
breakfast with U.S. troops and visit
the U.S. Pacific Command.
I
think that you will agree,
that there are often so many
tradgedies in the world that
occur in such frequency
and quick succession, that
we do not ever do justice to each
individual one. A gift of charity
or a passing thought are often
all that can be given, and in the
grand scheme of things it is hardly
enough from any one of us, even
though the act itself may be quite
impressive. If we remember these
events and resolve to do whatever
is in our power to do, then perhaps
we can as a society, hope to truly
help those in need.
If even the UN finds it difficult to
maintain peace in countries riddled
with war, then surely it is incumbent
on all of Humanity, each and ever
single individual, to help in ways
that we can. Let’s not be unrealistic,
not everyone can give up their day
job, sell their house and move, but
if we all collectively give the small
amount of time we all have spare to
the “good cause” then that amount
of effort is enough.
Now what remains is to see that
no external controls hold back a
country’s healing, which is usually
due to the actions of a neighbour
or a far richer, developed power
further away.
Our effort must not be plagued
by corrupt ineffectiveness.

in mind that as signatories to the
EU’s Human Rights Act, the UK
is committed to condemning the
use of the death penalty. When I
sent an email confronting him on
this, I immediately got a reply from
Mandy@Newlabour.org.uk, which
consisted solely of a spinning pic-
ture of a vortex and the words “This
did not happen” in large red font. I
only broke out of the spell by break-
ing the monitor with my fist. That’s
£300 you owe me, Labour.
So as you can see my adventures
to engage with politicians on a
straight level has kinda fallen flat.
But nil desperandum, I’m sure I’ll
learn to engage coherently in time
and raise my debating standard to
that of our leaders!
