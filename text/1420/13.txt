Winners of last term’s foray into the
world of dots and numbers was Shot-
gun. They were pretty blazing and
even I credit them on their speedy en-
try. The rest of you get to work!
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Going Underground
This is the most bestest blazing brai-
child to come out of the felix think-tank
since the suggestion of using comput-
ers to write the paper on. Megaz! Right
an explanation is possibly in order.
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned
a value, 1-26 (see table) and when add-
ed together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and you
get FUCWIT points. For any simple-
tons, I have done you an example.

Friday 16 January 2009
Welcome to felix sport. How’s it
going?
Great thanks! Hockey is going well
and 2009 promises to be an exciting
year all round.
So when you say that hockey is
going well – how well is it going?
As you can see from the league table
we have only lost one match, which
was disappointing since it was a BUCS
knockout game and we got to the semi-
finals last year in the equivalent com-
petition. I suppose it was a blessing
that it wasn’t a league match because
although we are top, Canterbury Christ
Church are not far behind! Currently
we haven’t played a ULU match yet but
there is definite potential for some bo-
nus silverware there as well!
If we do go up in BUCS it will be a
tough year – there are not many teams
that can sustain it in that league that
are not sports based universities.
Sounds good! What is the key to
success?
Well the team trains hard and plays
hard… We have developed a really
good team culture this year and we
have bonded into a strong squad. We
are also being supported financially by
the Union, Sport Imperial and Merrill
Lynch enabling us to have a coach who
is able to come to games which is huge-
ly beneficial! It takes the weight off my
shoulders in terms of training and the
starting line-up. It allows me to con-
centrate on playing my own game and
generate the camaraderie between the
boys on and off the pitch.
So what is the preparation for
you going to be like in the lead up
to varsity?
Our main focus presently is the
BUCS league and with ULU matches as
well, it will give us plenty of pitch time
before the big day… Varsity is never the
same as a League or Cup match, there
is far more passion and a hell of a lot
of pride at stake. On one hand, I view
it as a friendly (because essentially that
is what it is especially with it being sur-
rounded by important league and cup
fixtures), but on the other I will give
my all to win it… The adrenaline is
pumping through me now just think-
ing about it. For me it is a great honour
to be able to lead the 1st XI out onto
the pitch every week, but varsity does
have that little bit extra!
So how do you fancy your
chances?
To be honest we are unlikely to slip
up. We usually play the medics three
or four times a year since we are in
similar leagues which accumulates to
a lot of matches over four years… We
have only lost to them once in my time
and with the form we are in at the mo-
ment I predict a convincing win for the
College.
Why do you think
that IC Hockey is
consistently
better
than
their medic counterparts?
I’m unsure to be honest – you could
argue that the medics have a slower
turnover of players (since they are here
for a longer period of time) and there-
fore should produce better organised
teams that play well together. Hav-
ing said that the turnover of players
at Imperial gives the club a fresh feel
every year with new faces prepared to
give up time and push things forward.
There are literally only a couple of us
left who played in the 1st XI in my
first year – I have probably played with
twenty to thirty players over my time
at IC and I have learnt something dif-
ferent off all of them. The ladies 1st XI
have the medics on Sunday – we’ll see
what happens there! C’mon girls!
What about other sports – most
importantly the JPR Williams
Cup?
Well, hockey should dominate and
football seem to do the same. Maybe
the IC footballers and hockey players
should swap sports for the day – might
givethemedicsachance!Itwouldmake
my day if the rugby boys could do it…
They have had a pretty depressing sea-
son so far and it would give them the
boost they need to get them out of the
relegation zone in their BUCS league.
I will be supporting all of the IC sport
when I am not playing to the best of
my ability – I can make a lot of
noise when I want to. Maybe I
can make the difference at the
rugby!
Enough about varsity,
what about ICHC?
The club doesn’t need an
introduction. Clearly up there
with ICURFC and ICUAFC
but has the added bonus of be-
ing a mixed club making the socials
far more entertaining! On a personal
note it has provided me with a great
number of friends and some fabulous
memories and I will be sad to leave it
at the end of the year.
Any highlights?
Err, well tours to Cyprus and Ber-
lin were both a great laugh. Sports
tours are the combination of
everything great: beer, hockey,
sun and mates. The social
side in general is always a
highlight – I can count on
one hand the amount of
times I have missed a
Wednesday out with
the boys. Also the
success we have
had on the
pitch as a
team has
been
great
Six weeks until the big day! The build up to 25 February 2009 continues into the New Year, with the
Imperial 1st XI Hockey captain, Jack Cornish, being interviewed by the felix Sports Editor, Jack Cornish
for me and hopefully there will be some
more silverware on its way this year.
Where are you going on tour this
year?
India! It will be great! With a substan-
tial number of the club coming, there
is a hell of a lot to organise but I am
really looking forward to it! There will
be some great hockey and culture to
appreciate, not to mention the curry!
What are your aspirations once
you leave Imperial?
I have played with some very good
players during my time at IC… Four
or five have played at the highest level
in the UK and Germany and coming
from the deepest and darkest depths
of Somerset I never got the chance
to play at the highest standard… The
hockey I used to play at home could be
described a combination of village and
rural! Most turned up in their wellies
with a pint of cider in their hand! My
aim is to play for a national league club
even if I am playing for their 3rd XI…
At least then I have something to aim
for!
Not aiming for Olympic glory
then?!
Well, I like to be realistic… I would
like to be involved in some way
though – volunteering or
such like! It is a great
honour for London
to be host-
ing the games
– we now have to
make sure we don’t let
Boris anywhere near it! I
would like to play him at a game
of Wif-Waf.
What is orienteering?
Orienteering is a family of sports that
require navigational skills using a map
and compass to navigate from point to
point in diverse and usually unfamiliar
terrain. Eat that… You think I haven’t
been doing my research! Thanks Wiki!
Tell us a joke…
A wife and her husband are doing the
dishes one day when the wife suddenly
Ask the captain -
Jack Cornish
asks, “Gerald, what is it you have me
doing with your Saturday afternoons.
I’m starting to think that you might be
going and playing goalie for the lo-
cal hockey team”
Gerald keeps washing
dishes and replies “No
dearnothinglikethat,
I just drunk and
spend thou-
sandsofdol-
lars
on
hookers”
The wife goes back to her washing
and says “Ohh thank God, I was start-
ing to think you were a goalkeeper”
Right... What are your proudest
hockey moments?
Well there are several, including:
1. Playing for Somerset County.
2. Scoring my first goal for the 1st XI
3. Winning the ULU Cup final.
4. Captaining the 1st XI for the first
time.
5. Dowsing Murdoch with my large
gun.
Sporting Idol?
Maybe Chris ‘the real McCoy’ Hoy
but he has just won BBC Sports Per-
sonality of the Year which kind of puts
me off! Jovan Nedic is a fine figure of
an athlete as is Mr Murdoch, but the
stamina of Shippo means he has to win
it for me!
So no hockey idols then?
Nope.
OK, moving on swiftly, my fact
file on you mentions your affinity
for women. What is your opin-
ion on the centrefolds that have
graced felix this year?
Up to now there have been some
pretty poor efforts but this week’s takes
a hell of a lot to beat! It is yet anoth-
er classic from the Hockey Club,
the fittest club in town, proudly
sponsored by SuperSoaker.
Have you received any
‘heightism’ at your time
in Imperial?
Well, the bar in the
Davinces is a bit high to
reach. Further I con-
tinue to fail in my at-
tempts to touch the
bottom of the shal-
low end in the Ethos
swimming pool.
Thank you for
time Jack. One
final question.
How tall are
your actually?
Well the ques-
tion is, how tall
are you?
Jack, although a little and a feeble man, has managed
to hold down a 1st XI spot since his first year, and
spent the majority of his third stressing as Club
Captain. His liking for power is evident on many levels,
including his taste for women, however his tactics to
obtain them led to his eventual nickname following
a rumoured police enquiry. He says that he is fun,
approachable, kind, spontaneous and looking for
friendship. Maybe more... Enquiries to felix please.
