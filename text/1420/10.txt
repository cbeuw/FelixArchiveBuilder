The Belle of the Union Xmas Ball?
Free alcohol, mince pies, reindeer riding... Annabel Slater gives her verdict on last term’s festivities
T
he Imperial Christmas
Ball promised free mulled
wine, mince pies, sexy
elves, merry DJs, and
general festive fun for the
price of 9 pounds. Did it deliver? It
mostly did, after a slow start.
The face of the Union’s main build-
ing was emblazoned with screened
snowflake shapes, but beyond that, the
ground floor hosted little Christmassy
glitz. Pumping music played and gaudy
lights flickered over a conspicuously
empty dance room, and most Ball at-
tendants were packed into and tanking
up in the bar.
The Ball’s main theme attractions
were clustered in the concert room
upstairs where free popcorn, chocolate
and candy floss stalls stood along one
wall, a tiny twinkling grotto sat in the
corner, and a bucking reindeer-bronco
pit took up the rest of the room’s space.
Lights hung over the stage, snowflake
shapes strobed, and ambient music
played, but there was still only a small-
ish collection of people and most either
milled uncertainly in the limited space
of the aisle or stood looking at the still
unanswered challenge of the reindeer
bronco with its glowering controls
man. Two massive, glossy chocolate
fountains offered diversions for the
gluttonous and hosted a range of cook-
ie bits and confectionary which could
be stabbed with skewers and drowned
in thick liquid deliciousness. My boy-
friend eagerly hunted the crowd for the
promised sexy elves, and we were not
disappointed when a tall man in cling-
ing scarlet tights and a sleekly small elf
outfit strolled past. Mince pies were
circulating in abundance but sadly
mulled wine wasn’t, due to a sugar and
salt mix up, and… well, free alcohol
was currently off the cards, which was
also why the bar was so busy.
It would have been nice to have the
attractions of the Ball spread out over
a wider area of the Union, or to have
a seating area alongside the food stalls
for better mingling and chat, but really
for a student-led event, it was a good
effort. Sure enough, as the twinkling
lights, ambient music and masses of
free sugar took effect, people began
tackling the reindeer and the Ball took
on a livelier air.
Santa stayed manfully in his grotto,
posing for photos, the mulled wine
eventually reappeared and good vibes
were overflowing. After the concert
hall closed at midnight, the night con-
tinued with the dance room packed
full of festive revellers bopping along
to pop, or sprawling happily outside
with barbecued hotdogs and burgers.
It was a modest affair, modestly priced,
and a merry time.

T
he space between Christ-
mas and New Year’s Eve
can be a somewhat surreal
time. Recovering from
whatever joys (or horrors)
Christmas has brought the days often
seem to meld in to one as you prepare
yourself for another new year.
Fortunately for some it was in to
this festive haze that Durrr at The End
stepped, perfectly timing its ‘Not NYE
Party’ on 29th December to allow for
over 24 hours of recuperation before
new year’s celebrations began.
After adjusting to being back in cen-
tral London with a few cocktails we
headed off to the End. Hidden round
the corner of West Central Street we
follow the queue round to the entrance,
down the stairs, and out of the cold.
With a bar to my right, dance floor to
my left, and night with Peaches and
“Special Guest DJ” lined up I’m think-
ing I can’t go wrong. Until I realise I
have to go back up to the freezing cold
entrance to use the cloakroom.
Although this is not a great design
it is a good way of checking out what
the mix of people out tonight is like.
Known as the End’s alternative/indie
night, it’s not too surprising to see
more than a few outfits at Durrr that
look suspiciously like a hand-knitted
Christmas present from grandma
paired with leggings. However, by the
time our coats are out of the way a fair-
ly mixed crowd has gathered, the bar
is already 5 people deep, and a great
atmosphere is building.
For those who haven’t made it to the
End yet (and if you’re planning hurry
as it closes the 24th January!) the club
consists of two rooms with an entrance
space between and is entirely under-
ground. The first room, on the right
as you enter, features the bar and a
small stage which, at Durrr, has hosted
a huge range of bands including Franz
Ferdinand, Ladyhawke and Foals.
The second room is essentially a
huge cellar with a DJ booth at one end.
With arched ceilings and strategically
placed seating in the darker corners it’s
just the right size to fill with music and
lights, whilst still giving the impression
of a small room where you can be stood
next to the DJ the whole night.
The dance floor slowly fills up, with
a mix of indie and electro playing, un-
Not New Years Eve; it’s The End
Katherine Goates reviews Durrr@The End, before the club closes its doors for the final time this month
til tonight’s main feature, Peaches, ap-
pears in the DJ booth. The last time I
saw Peaches she was rubbing her pink
sparkly ensemble against a Reading
Festival crowd, so I (and most of the
crowd) can probably be forgiven for
spending the first 20 minutes of her
set trying to ascertain what she was
wearing. Unfortunately her curly, half-
bleached Mohican and two piece with
leather fringes reaching the floor was
probably more inspiring than her DJ
set. Keeping the pace up and throwing
in crowd pleasers from Santogold and
MGMT it’s a good set but seemed to
lack the smooth finish of the rest of the
night.
I would, however, hazard a guess
that my view of Peaches’ set is slightly
tainted by the fact that a while later
the “Special Guest DJ” turns out to
be Erol “King of Electo” Alkan. The
phrase “master at work” seems fairly
apt at this point. The room is com-
pletely packed and various characters
are dancing along the edges of the
DJ booth flailing limbs (and more) at
the equally entranced crowd. Effort-
lessly delivering a set blending his own
remixes with standard anthems like
Rock the Casbah and a whole load of
other great music it’s not until the end
of Erol’s set until people seem to even
contemplate leaving (and then I’m fair-
ly sure a lot of them were carried out),
frankly New Year’s Eve can wait when
it’s ‘Not NYE’.
