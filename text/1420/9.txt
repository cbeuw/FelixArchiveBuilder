middle, and a rather modern
bass line.
Another track that
catches one’s attention
is ‘In style and rhythm’.
Advertised as the song
with “cool latin beats”,
the distinctly electronic
intro had me slightly
worried as to what was
to come next… it is ac-
tually quite catchy. You
feel tempted to boogie in
your seat but the urge is
not quite as strong as the
vibe you got from some of
Sir Tom’s earlier works.
The title, and also conclud-
ing track, ‘24 Hours’, is oddly
disappointing. It is a slow track,
perfect for demonstrating Jones’
frothy vocals, but he has not taken
the opportunity to do so, hence the
song collapses into three unrelated
layers of vocals (good), instrumental
section (good), and percussion (good).
Put together they sound less good.
What amused me more than the title
track was a little mid-table track called
‘Sugar Daddy’. Maybe it was because
this is one of the tracks where Sir Tom’s
iconic voice DOES shine through con-
fidently with lots of oomph. Maybe it
is because it has exceptionally catchy
phrases. Maybe it is because he shouts
“OOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW
HOLY SCHMOLEY” in the middle of
the song.
Overall, I feel that the upbeat tracks
far overshadow the ballads. I simply
feel that Sir Tom is more in his
element when per-
forming big
numbers –

Tom Jones
24 Hours
EMI
HHHII
Can you teach an old dog new tricks?
(not that Tom Jones is old). Sir Tom has
established himself with a musical ca-
reer that took off before the first moon
landing. The new album, 24 Hours, is
described as a record that is “intimate,
personal, moving and full of fire”, and
more decorated with the singer’s own
composing skills than any of his previ-
ous albums.

The record opens nice-
ly with the aptly named
‘I’m alive’. This is as
Tom Jones-y as it gets.
Drums, then bass, an
enormous trumpet
crescendo, followed
by Sir Tom belting out
“I’M ALIVE!” Brilliant.
We are getting into the
groove. The first sin-
gle, ‘If he should ever
leave you’, is the second
track and rings out with
a laid-back, retro tune; lots
of string elements with a
nice trumpet solo in the
bass,
lots
of trumpets and a big voice
together makes it all the more excit-
ing. The slow numbers, albeit more
personable and with more occasions to
hold sustained notes, do not hold ones
attention as well.
This album is principally produced
by drum ‘n’ bass company Future Cut,
who also work with Lily Allen, Dizzee
Rascal, Estelle and Kate Nash. They
have indeed managed to mix Jones’ old
cinematic styles with currently fash-
ionable sounds and made this new al-
bum really quite enjoyable, and it was
a very long time ago since I said that
about a new record from somebody
as young as 68. However, you need to
give it a few run-throughs before some
songs start to grown on you. As for me,
I will stick to the upbeat tracks.
When I first heard of Fat Freddy’s
Drop, I had no clue who they were. Af-
ter just a few searches, I was convinced
by their renowned live performances,
their melodious reggae-soul rhythms
and their BBC’s Worldwide Album of
the Year award in 2005, that this show
would be a great evening. The seven-
piece ensemble originating from New
Zealand first got known through their
gigs in native Wellington and their in-
dependent singles releases, but made it
big in 2005 with their first and only al-
bum Based on a True Story, from which
was released the hit single ‘Wandering
Eye’. While they qualify themselves as
hi-tek soul, it sounds more like a mod-
ern reggae beat with a drop of dub and
soul with some skanking funk here and
there. This overall gives a very inter-
esting fusion of sounds, topped off by
singer Joe Dukie’s very cool soul lyrics.
Just think of the evolutionary contem-
porary of Toots and the Maytals. Last
Friday’s show at Camden’s Roundhouse
was promising - it was the last concert
of their 2008 Europe tour, after which
they left back to the Southern Hemi-
sphere for God knows how long. Thus,
many were hoping for an electrifying
performance, with maybe some new
songs on the way?
The first part was well assumed by
Aruba Red, an emerging female singer
who mixed acoustic soul and reggae,
with a heavy Caribbean influence (who
could have guessed with that name)...
Her lyrics are more political than Fat
Freddy’s Drop’s, and not everyone had
an ear for her that night as most were
excitingly awaiting the Kiwis. Still, the
audience was warmed up nicely after-
words, and she left the stage to enthu-
siastic applause. But was it more about
her perform-
ance or
about the
next band fi-
nally coming in?
After a somewhat
lengthy set-up, Fat Freddy’s
Drop made their appearance on stage
accompanied by the ecstatic screams
of the crowd. Sadly, truth be told, the
overall show was not quite up to the
expectations.
They started with a smooth piece
to ease us in, but unfortunately con-
tinued on that rhythm for most of the
evening. The show was full of ups and
Fat Freddy’s mediocre drop
at Camden Roundhouse
downs as the band went from mellow
reggae to quicker dub beats and then
back to almost-ballads, but we did not
get much of the spontaneous jazzy ska
improvisation they are know for in
their live performances. The last cher-
ry to top the sundae of discontent: they
did not play their major hit ‘Wander-
ing Eye’. The “encores” still resound in
my ears along with gentle weeps from
some fans who came especially to ex-
perience that song live.
Still, all members are extremely
gifted and at the peak of their art, as
demonstrated by the solos from each
of the six instruments: saxophone,
trumpet, trombone, keyboard (also the
resident DJ), drums and guitar. These
solely instrumental intervals were very
interesting but sometimes did last a
little too long and failed to entertain
the audience for their entire duration.
What the hell, there was hot cider at
the bar! Also against this, it has to be
said that the location itself is to blame:
Fat Freddy’s Drop’s slow but melodious
pieces lost a lot of their magic in the
large capacity amphitheater, enough to
fit nearly 2000 people, but can be eas-
ily be imagined as being unforgettable
on the stage of a smaller and more inti-
mate venue. Or on a beach side in New
Zealand (or even Aruba)…?
In brief, the band fell a little short
of what we wanted to hear, but that
does not take anything away from the
immense musical talent of the band,
the smoothness of their tracks, and
the good lyrics and looks of their lead
singer. Fat Freddy’s Drop is definitely
a band to discover and a must-have in
your music library; I will be waiting for
a new album impatiently, hoping next
time they come around it will be in a
more appropriate setting.

Alexandra Ashford comments on this year’s musical prospects.
Check out our playlist at www.8tracks.com/musicfelix to listen
Well here we are, 2009. What’s going to
be buzzing from your iPod earphones
this year? Will there be a nu-metal re-
vival? Will you regret throwing away
those Papa Roach CDs? Will Duffy,
Adele, and all those similar feisty fe-
male singers that no-one listens to,
form a super group managed by Si-
mon Cowell? Will Kanye West go even
further with his geek image and team
up with Aphex Twin? Will Madonna
finally retire? Will Amy Winehouse/
Britney Spears/Pete Doherty finally
die/recover/re-invent themselves as
day-time television presenters? Will
we all be able to forget Alphabeat ever
existed and breathe a collective sigh
of relief? Who knows, it’s all pos-
sible! Music seems more diverse than
ever and great music has been coming
from really leftfield places (Bon Iver
was conjured up by a guy holed up in
a log cabin with liver disease). But in
the zeitgeist of music publications ev-
erywhere, here are my predictions for
what you will be downloading err... le-
gally this year.
Little Boots
There’s a good chance you are sick
of hearing about how Little Boots
is THE sound of 2009, but who can
deny the catchiness and dancability
of ‘Meddle’. There are already hun-
dreds of remixes of this song. But
is this kind of electro-pop still what
we want to hear? I’m kind of over it
already. Named after the Roman em-
porer Caligula, hopefully she won’t
reign tyrannically over the airwaves
for too long this year before being as-
sassinated. Listen to: Love Kills
La Roux
Last year at a Kistune Maison party
I spent hours in a bathroom with La
Roux and I didn’t even know it was
her, so I never got to embarrass my-
self telling her how fabulous I think
she is. Her music is an electro-pop
disco blend that’s less techno-y than
that of Little Boots, largely influenced
by 80s synth-pop bands like the Hu-
man League. Her hairstyle is largely
influenced by A Flock Of Seagulls.
Listen to: Quicksand
Mumford & Sons
I think I have listened to the song
‘Hold On to What You Believe’ about
a hundred times already this year.
They are making heartfelt folky,
bluesy rock and damn, it is good.
Their music is like a scene in a
film where the main character
is sitting around a campfire
with people he barely knows
but everyone feels like they’ve
known each other forever and
someone pulls out a guitar. Sud-
denly everyone sings songs of
their confessions and heartbreak
and everyone has a moment togeth-
er. Listen to: White Blank Page
a punk-rock Barbie (don’t we already
have Pink and Gwen doing that any-
way? Have we not learned?). Still, her
music is catchy and if you’re the sort of
person who has a D.A.N.C.E. ringtone,
has been to TigerTiger, and considers
coloured tights daring, you just might
enjoy it. Listen to: Just Dance
KiD CuDi
The token rapper of this article - I’ve
only heard of him because he has
worked with Kanye. I am not big up
on my hip-hop so I don’t know what’s
really fresh in this genre. ‘Day ‘N’
Night’ has quite a pleasing dubstep-
influenced rhythm and introspective
sort of sound – the sort of song
that will be on your iPod but
not on the dancefloor (though
of course this is what
remixes are for).
I’m not
sure
if
lurk-
ing in Kanye’s
shadow so closely
is going to be good
for him, though –
according to Google
image search he
seems to be try-
ing to pull off
the exact
same look
(didn’t
Kanye
just blend
Lupe
and An-
dre3000’s
styles any-
way?). It
may have
worked for
Kanye as his
thing, but
for everyone
else, wearing
those shutter shades was like having
a knob drawn on their head. Listen to:
Day ‘N’ Night
Hockey
This band is really my hot tip for
this year. You can tell a really good
song when you listen to it and can’t
believe you’ve never heard it before -
it sounds like the sort of classic song
you carry in your head forever. That
is the feeling I get from ‘Song Away’.
Decades from now, teenagers will be
discovering this song on late night
radio shows and they will get the ex-
act same feeling. If you ever yearn
for the days of yore when the Strokes
were the coolest band you knew and
the NME was a good place to find
new bands, listen to Hockey. Listen
to: “Song Away”
Shoegaze revivals (Van She, Aso-
bi Seksu, M83, Vivian Girls, etc.)
If you have never heard the word
‘shoegaze’ before, here’s a rough sum-
mary: layers and layers of fuzzy flang-
ing droning guitar riffs. Shoegaze
started in the mid ‘80s and ended in
the mid ‘90s, but lots of bands of the
past year have been referring back to
this genre that is often overlooked
outside of Sophia Coppola movies.
Listen to: Vivian Girls - ‘Where do
you run to?’
Disco revivals (Hercules and
Love Affair, In Flagranti,
Heartbreak, Sally Sha-
piro, Lindstrøm, end-
less others)
Oh, you’re still danc-
ing to Justice and
MGMT? How very
two-thousand-
and-eight. Dance
music DJs have been
digging up italo disco
treasures from the ‘70s
and ‘80s and new artists
have been emerging who
are basing their sound on
the simple almost naïve
sounds of decades ago when
polyphonic synthesizers
had only just come about.
It is a kick back against
the over produced, over
worked sound of modern
electro and a delve into
guilty pleasures and
non-ironic enjoy-
ment of the camp,
kitsch and dec-
adent. Listen
to: Heart-
break -
‘We’re
back’.
“Maybe it
is because
he shouts
‘OOOOOOOWW
HOLY
SCHMOLEY’ in
the middle of the
song.”
Lady GaGa
“Decades
from now,
teenagers will
be discovering
this song on
late night radio
shows”
Lady GaGa
Who the fuck is Lady GaGa? I’ve seen
her name in newspapers and maga-
zines but I had never listened to Lady
GaGa until writing this sentence.
Seems to be marketed like a ‘cool’
version of Britney/Christina which
is about as much of an oxymoron as
Local heroes from Brixton’s old acid
house scene, the Alabama 3, have been
purveying a unique brand of pseudo-
gospel electronica for the last ten years,
despite being almost totally ignored by
the mainstream music industry. Still,
they sold out the Apollo, albeit to a
crowd who were mostly the wrong side
of middle-age – perhaps trying to re-
capture some lost youth. After one of
the worst warm-up acts I’ve seen for a
while (fronted by a girl who seemed to
be in the unusual situation of singing
in a band while waiting for her big shot
in a strip club, rather than the other
way round), the ringmaster came out
to introduce the main event...
The Alabama 3 have always blown
hot and cold at their live shows. Some-
times, as at Glastonbury last year, they
can be sublime and blew the likes of
the Fun Lovin’ Criminals right off the
stage. This time however, they were
rubbish. Joined by an aged Mick Jones
from The Clash and a clearly pilled-up
veteran of the Utah Saints, who jumped
around telling us how great commu-
nism is, they just didn’t have room for
the full complement of gospel choir
and brass section that I’ve seen them
use before and had to settle for a key-
board instead. Worse still, the sound
system had no way of coping with the
five vocalists they often had perform-
ing at once, so each track ran into the
next in a fog of repetitive bass lines.
The show was saved from 1-star dis-
aster by the remarkable Zoe Devlin,
the band’s female vocalist – a voice like
molten gold and the outfit of a fetish
dancer. Frankly I could listen to her all
day, although I reckon I could just look
at her for a substantial portion of one
as well. Her acoustic rendition of ‘You
Don’t Dance To Techno Any More’ de-
servedly received the biggest audience
reaction all night, and her dancing
nearly induced a seizure in the old boy
sat next to me (who was 72, inciden-
tally – a strange crowd).
Her performance aside though, the
band were mediocre at best – they
wheeled out the big guns for the end of
the set, but by then I’d totally lost inter-
est. I didn’t even bother staying for the
encore – ‘nuff said.

Alabama 3 live at the Apollo
“I
remember back when I
was young, we used to
download music for free
without a care in the
world.” I hold a match to
my pipe and take a puff, then two, and
gaze wistfully out of the window “It was
like the Wild West and we were the in-
ternet cowboys. We obeyed no-one,
corralling MP3s with our lasso clicks.
I’ve got to say, I was quite the virile
downloader in my youth... yes sirree.”
My voice trails off as I nod my head to
a half-forgotten, grainy 128 kbit/s beat.
My grandchildren sit at the foot of my
rocking chair, incredulous.
Even now, less than a decade into the
Napster-induced revolution in the mu-
sic industry, it seems like nothing but
a beautiful dream that one could, once
upon a time, download music for free
and not care about the implications
– it never felt illegal. Contrary to the
extreme and often absurd position of
bodies such as the RIAA, downloading
a song is clearly not the same as steal-
ing a CD from a shop, and no amount
of copied musical kilobytes can jus-
tify filing multi-million dollar lawsuits
against individuals. If it did anything,
this massive and public overreaction
merely stalled the inevitable realisation
that actually, a grand’s worth of MP3s
don’t come for free. Eventually the guilt
catches up with you, like the creeping
sickness of a Sartrean nausea.
However, the problems that the in-
ternet can create with its right hand
it can destroy with its left; a new gen-
eration of websites and programs are
starting to break into the mainstream
which allow users to stream music on-
line legally and effectively for free. I say
effectively because the services are of-
ten paid for by advertising, but it is a
small price to pay – the artists get their
credit, the users balance their karma,
and everyone’s a winner. What’s more,
these services often utilise the commu-
nity and connectivity of the internet to
introduce new elements into the lis-
tening experience.
A great example of this is a program
called Spotify (available from http://
www.spotify.com), which allows users
to stream songs at the price of an ad-
vertisement every 10 songs or so. The
Spotify database is pretty huge but not
totally comprehensive, though person-
ally I think this works to its advantage.
I’ve discovered dozens of odd remixes
and collaborations which I wouldn’t
have given a chance to before.
Another quirky little development
is the phenomenon of internet mixes.
Podcasts and the like have been avail-
able from big name DJs and various
people for years, but websites such
as 8tracks (http://www.8tracks.com)
and various others allow users to cre-
ate their own mini-playlists and share
them online with friends and well-
wishers at the click of a link. In fact,
we at music.felix have embraced this
wholeheartedly and made one our-
selves! You can listen to ours at http://
www.8tracks.com/musicfelix - we will
be updating this every week or so, so
be sure to check back regularly. This
week we’ve got a ‘Music of 2009’ theme
to go with Alexandra Ashford’s lovely
article to the right of this column.
The sun is setting on the Wild West
days of an uncharted internet. In addi-
tion to being legally unacceptable, it’s
now becoming socially unacceptable
to download music for free. Nonethe-
less, the original ideal on which P2P
downloading was founded, that of the
need to share great music with friends,
is alive in the new, more conscious gen-
eration of music sharing applications.
