Council rejects split Sabbatical
A controversial motion to split the role
of Deputy President Education and
Welfare (DPEW) has fallen at Union
Council as tensions rise in the Sabbati-
cal team.
The motion, proposed by Jennifer
Morgan, would have created two new
sabbatical roles, Deputy President Ed-
ucation and Deputy President Welfare,
while scrapping the current DPEW po-
sition. Although a majority of Council
members supported the motion, vot-
ing 20 for and 12 against, the motion
did not reach the required two-thirds
majority.
Criticisms of the paper came thick
and fast as Council members took of-
fence at what they perceived to be a
poorly written and poorly prepared
paper. Council members were not re-
assured when Jenny Morgan admit-
ted that she had not had the time to
write up the proposal properly, as she
was unwell, and that what was sub-
mitted was essentially a rough draft.
The question of funding was raised
and there was some concern that the
proposals didn’t mention where fund-
ing would be sourced. Jenny Morgan
responded by telling Council that she
knew that many high-ranking College
staff supported the move to increase
student representation, including the
Rector, Sir Roy Anderson.
The motion was supported by
DPEW Hannah Theodorou who ar-
gued strongly that the motivation for
the new roles was the large workload
associated with her position. With
these new positions, she argued, there
would be more time to actively engage
with the student body rather than be-
ing bogged down with meeting after
meeting.
The DPEW and the President were
united on the proposal with Deputy
President Clubs and Societies Lily
Topham remaining mostly silent
throughout Council. However a clear
split emerged when Deputy President
Finance and Services Christian Carter
dramatically attacked the proposal
claiming that his job had a similar
workload to the DPEW. He accused
the President of trying to rush an un-
prepared motion through Council and
warned that if the College did not pro-
vide funding for the position then the
Union would be forced to divert mon-
ey away from clubs and societies.
Christian Carter received support
from the Faculty Union Presidents who
claimed that some welfare responsi-
bilities could be transferred to the fac-
ulty level away from the central union.
DPEW Hannah Theodorou dismissed
this notion, arguing that the faculty
unions did not carry enough weight
to effectively represent students to
the college or outside of university on
complicated welfare issues.
Consternation eventually gave way
to fatigue as discussions continued
into their third hour despite some ef-
forts to end debate of the issue; one
council member was strongly repri-
manded by the Council Chair for call-
ing the debate of the issue “stupid”.
Confusion about funding remained
right up to the vote as Jenny Morgan
strongly asserted that College would
provide funding and Christian Carter
rebuffed her saying she was gambling
with clubs and societies’ funding. The
DPFS claimed that the Union might be
left high and dry by the College even
if College Council permitted the new
roles in the knowledge that they would
be expected to fund them. He warned
that the College might make cuts to the
subvention (money the College gives
to the Union each year – amounting to
over 1 million pounds) elsewhere.
Several Medic councillors had to
leave Council early and therefore a
vote was called on the motion, which
was narrowly defeated.
DPFS Christian Carter commented
after the meeting that there had been
“no real discussion of the alternatives
or any professional assessment of
whether a new role is needed at all”. He
lamented what he called “the manner
in which the proposers are trying to
rush through something so important
without consulting those whom it ac-
tually affects.”
Social Clubs Committees Chair
(SCC) Peter Mabbott agreed with
Christian Carter saying that although
“the President and DPEW held an open
meeting on the subject before Council”
that because most Council members
were considering the proposal for the

Imperial Summer Ball
tickets now on sale, but at an
increased price to last year’s
Imperial College London’s Summer
Ball is the largest student ball in Lon-
don and this year’s Ball will be the big-
gest, most lavish and most exciting yet!
Tickets are already on sale for the event
which takes place across our South
Kensington campus and is attended
by over 2,500 revellers. With great acts
and DJ’s, a formal dinner, fireworks, a
funfair, a casino, marquees, light shows
and more, the Summer Ball 2009 is the
not-to-be-missed event of Imperial’s
calendar. Tickets for our formal 600
seated dinner always sell out fast, so
organise you and your friends and get
a table together!
An Entertainments Ticket offers full
entry to all the entertainments and acts
on the evening starting from 19:30. A
Dinner and Entertainments Ticket of-
fers all that the Entertainments Ticket
does but with a Champagne Reception
from 17:30 and a four course meal with
after-dinner speakers in our lavish
Queen’s Lawn Marquee.
The starting prices for the two tick-
ets are £30 and £65 respectively. The
cost of the Dinner and Entertainments
ticket has increased by £10 from last
year’s price, whilst the Entertainments
ticket has only increased by £5. Some
students have questioned these price
increases, which would produce at
least an extra £6,000 of revenue for the
organisers. Deputy President (Finance
& Services) Christian Carter, who is
responsible for the Summer Ball, told
felix that “The costs have increased
(particularly food prices) and the ticket
prices had not changed for two years.
In order to run an event that does not
lose money we either have to raise
prices or cut the standard of the ball.
The price increase means that we can
continue to deliver the same quality of
dinner and the big name acts as has be-
come expected.”
Whatever the reason, the event is
sure to be an entertaining one and one
that has increased in popularity over
the years.

It looks like the credit crunch just got a
whole lot worse, as this year’s universi-
ty graduates will be facing the toughest
battle for jobs in a generation. Tens of
thousands could be facing unemploy-
ment over the coming months owing
to the impact of the economic down-
turn, with 18-24 year olds bearing the
brunt of redundancies.
Ministers are so concerned that
they’ve decided to do something
about it, drawing up a rescue package
to help the class of 2009 find a job or
acquire new skills when they graduate
this summer. They include an intern-
ship scheme where students would
work at a reduced wage to gain ex-
perience. This ‘National Internship
Scheme’ is currently being backed by
four firms, including Barclays and Mi-
crosoft. However as job vacancies get
slashed, major companies and invest-
ment banks are narrowing their search
for new recruits to a limited number
of elite universities, mainly Oxford,
Cambridge and, you’ll be glad to hear,
Imperial College (phew!). But make no
mistake, the competition will be the
most brutal it has ever been.
Chief executive of the Association of
Graduate Recruiters is warning final-
year students that a good degree on
its own is no longer enough – gradu-
ates now need to make themselves-as
attractive as possible by emphasising-
work experience and life skills. “Many
of this year’s graduates will be in for a
shock because they have grown up in
an affluent society, so have become a
little complacent, believing that good
jobs ‘fall from trees’”, the organisation
says.
So with employment chances look-
ing bleak, what are the options? Well,
if slogging your guts out in an intern-
ship for the minimum pay doesn’t take
your fancy and neither does long-term
unemployment, then your other op-
tion is to go back to summer-holiday
jobs that you thought were well in
your student life past. According to
the Association of Graduate Recruit-
ers, university-leavers should be pre-
pared to stack shelves or work behind
a bar as the recession bites. However,
even these unskilled jobs may be hard
to come by. With past government ini-
tiatives of putting 50% of adults into
higher education, the labour market
has been flooded with degree holders
for some time now and so graduates
being forced to take non-graduate jobs
is not a new trend, it’s just a worsening
one with the recession.
The disheartening reality that you
toiled your way through university and
bled your finances dry, only to end up
with a job at Tesco will, it appears, be
shared by many. Experts warn that the
demoralising effects of unemployment
on young people could turn into long-
term “scarring” if they are out of work
for more than a year, making it harder
to reconnect with stable career jobs
later on.
So in other words, until things get
better, university-leavers should make
the most of any job they can get their
graduate hands on because also, don’t
forget, there’s the small matter of a stu-
dent loan that needs paying off. Have a
Happy 2009!
Students from Imperial College have
been fined a total of £2,000 for “ille-
gal map-making” in a Chinese prov-
ince last September. Dr Jian Guo Liu,
a Reader in Remote Sensing from the
Department of Earth Science and En-
gineering, was on a routine survey in
the Xinjiang area with a final year un-
dergraduate and one PhD student.
Dr Liu and the students, who wish
to remain anonymous, were invited by
the Institute of Crustal Dynamics, part
of the China Seismological Bureau, to
carry out earthquake fault research in
the Chinese areas of Aksu and Keping.
The Aksu area itself is one of the tens-
est areas in Xinjiang, where many of
the local Muslim Uighur population
are hostile to Chinese rule. A series of
lethal attacks in Xinjiang were ascribed
to separatist terrorist groups during the
summer, particularly just in advance of
the Beijing Olympics.
Due to the Olympics taking place,
the usual method of obtaining paper-
work was severely delayed, which is
why the group obtained a visa through
an invitation from the China Seismo-
logical Bureau.
The tension in the area and the pres-
ence of foreign scientists on Chinese
soil could have been one of the reasons
for the crackdown, it apparently being
illegal to carry out any scientific work
without the correct paperwork, as it is
considered a threat to state security.
The Aksu Land and Resource Bureau
accepted that the students had an “in-
nocent explanation” in a statement re-
leased on the 5th January 2009, but that
they had collected “illegal data” from
6,000 points that were valuable for
mineral prospecting and topographi-
cal research.
A spokesperson for Imperial College
London said: “They were investigat-
ing a very active fault system which
is known to have a direct impact on
earthquakes that have occurred near-
by. The project involved collecting in-
formation about tectonic plate activity
to help scientists understand the geo-
logical history of the area, which is po-
tentially of use to the local population
for earthquake hazard management.”
“On 19 September 2008, the Aksu
Bureau of Land and Resources stopped
their geological field work and con-
fiscated their two GPS receivers, sur-
veying results and data. The students
were questioned but not arrested and
no formal charges were made. They
were fined RMB 10,000 (approxi-
mately £1,000) each. The College has
reimbursed this cost. On 28 Septem-
ber, research and field equipment was
returned to the students. The students
arrived safely back in London on 2
October 2008. Their studies have not
been affected.”
Fined £2,000 for
‘illegal map-making’

Dr Liu told the Telegraph on the 5th
January that he had been taking stu-
dents to the area to study geology for
nearly 10 years and has never encoun-
tered any problems. He said that “We
considered not going but everything
was booked and the study was crucial
field work for my student’s PhD.”
He insisted that the GPS data the pair
gathered could not have been used for
mapping, and that the large volume of
data was mostly collected by a previ-
ous student who had not cleared it be-
fore handing it back.
“We agree that they didn’t have the
proper paperwork but they didn’t
do any mapping work,” he said. “The
Chinese are very sensitive to foreign-
ers working in that region but it’s their
country, what can you do?” He went on
to say that it would be “very unlikely”
that he will get permission to take any
students back to the area to carry out
more work.

first time it was not the right time to
vote on the Constitution. However
he attacked the DPFS suggestion that
money would be lost from clubs and
societies if the role was created. The
SCC chair said it was wrong to bring in
the issue of money “in the way he did”
and that “No one should have been put
in a position where they were think-
ing “I agree with the idea, but feel it
is more important to make sure that
clubs and societies get that £25,000, so
I’ll vote against it””
Despite the support of the majority
of council members, the proposal’s fu-
ture is now uncertain as this year’s Sab-
batical elections draw closer. Before
being implemented, the Trustee Board
must rubber-stamp the new positions
and then the College Council must ap-
prove the proposals when it meets on
the 13th of February. On Tuesday the
12th of January, the Trustee Board met
and it agreed to approve the position
if the Union Council decided to cre-
ate it, provided that an assurance was
given that College funding would be
obtained.
The paper will be brought to Council
again on the 18th of January and with
only a few councillors to convince, it
seems all but certain that the Deputy
President Education and Welfare will
be split in half.
