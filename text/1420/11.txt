My New Year resolution: watch more films
Begin the year with smiles by persuad-
ing yourself to go and see Yes Man. Jim
Carrey is back on form playing Carl, a
loan advisor at a bank who is desper-
ately miserable after a rocky divorce
and so hates his life.
Finding joy only by renting DVD’s
and watching them alone, his best
friend Peter (Cooper) tries his hardest
to make him have a social life and en-
joy himself. One day at work, Carl runs
into an old friend who tells him about
a self-help seminar which commands
people to say “yes” to everything they
are asked. After attending the meeting
and then running out of petrol as soon
as he has left it, Carl bumps into Al-
lison (Deschanel), a free-spirited and
easy-going photographer. After this
unforgettable encounter, Carl decides
to become a Yes Man and soon finds
himself doing things he wouldn’t nor-
mally dream of.
The movie is based on a book by Eng-
lish comedian and writer Danny Wal-
lace, who decided to say “yes” to situa-
tions he would normally say “no” to for
a year to make his life more interesting.
This idea was taken and turned into a
Hollywood film, and very successfully
too, as Yes Man is a hilarious, feel-good
comedy that is big on laughs and low
on cheese – something that this re-
viewer greatly appreciates.
Jim Carrey gives a great perform-
ance, one that is reminiscent of his 90’s
glory although slightly toned down for
a contemporary audience. The sup-
porting cast are also really likeable and
funny: Zooey Deschanel is appealing
as a sexy but quirky girl-next-door
leading lady; Bradley Cooper is witty
and compelling as his best friend and
New Zealand comedian Rhys Darby
almost steals the show with his geeky
and hilarious character Norman.
The script sparkles and feels original,
mainly because the dialogue is realistic
and bubbly and most of the set pieces
are extremely funny to watch. Some
of the best moments are completely
unexpected, for example the opening
scene in a video rental store, a Harry
Potter party, Carl’s elderly next door
neighbour and a fight outside of a bar,
although the overall sarcastic tone
of the film helps make each joke run
seamlessly into another.
It is not often that I see a film that
makes me laugh the whole way
through, especially one that borders on
chick-flick territory, but Yes Man is a
well-plotted and unique film that takes
a funny idea and runs with it.
Want to chase the blues away this
year? Then I recommend kick-start-
ing 2009 with this very enjoyable and
uplifting comedy. Just say “yes” to Yes
Man!

Just say “yes!” to Yes Man
You can’t stop smiling once you say “yes”!
Although it has been said that the chick
flick is dead, Hollywood isn’t going to
give up without a fight as they continue
to bring out films like Bride Wars, star-
ring heavyweights Kate Hudson (How
To Lose A Guy In 10 Days) and Anne
Hathaway (The Princess Diaries).
Best friends Liv (Hudson) and Emma
(Hathaway) both dream of having
the perfect wedding and having both
planned to have it at the Plaza Hotel

Hollywood starlets Kate Hudson and Anne
Hathaway go head-to-head in Bride Wars
have both booked their perfect venue
on the same day and only one of them
can have it! Let the war begin! Although
it includes an all-star cast, Bride Wars
has already been mauled by the crit-
ics for having a terrible plot, with one
critic already considering it being on
his list of the worst films of 2009! It
sounds like a good idea and with two
sexy leads it could be entertaining, es-
pecially when the setup is the worse
nightmare of every, single bride to
be – men take note: if you mess with
any woman’s wedding, prepare to face
WAR!
WARNING: Do not mess with a Bride! That goes double for two brides.

T
he noughties are finally
coming to an end- and
soon the 10’s will engulf
us. But fear not! It has
been a very good dec-
ade for the film industry: the rise of
money-making, blockbuster, super-
hero movies and the almost death of
chick flicks (which have in fact made
a comeback- just look at the Sex and
the City movie) has meant that every
studio in Hollywood has been des-
perate to churn out an action/fantasy
film that will guarantee them a big
monetary return.
Although some of the most expen-
sive films ever made were created
this decade (Spiderman 3 apparently
cost almost half a billion dollars)
low-budget, indie movies have also
fought through the generic save-the-
world plots to triumph – look at how
successful films which were shot in
front of a green screen were (e.g. 300
and Sin City), just showing how much
modern cinema depends on computer
graphics.
This decade has also seen sequel af-
ter sequel after sequel – showing that
when you have no other ideas and are
determined not to take risks, putting
your eggs in one basket can in fact pay
off. But this year, the final year of the
naughtiest decade ever, we continue
to have the kind of movies that have
defined the 00’s: remakes, reboots
and sequels.
The horror genre has always been
known for remaking every idea it
has ever had, whether they have been
good or bad, but this year we will see
the new ‘in thing’ in Hollywood: 3D!
Kicking off with My Bloody Valentine:
3D in January and finishing the year
in Final Destination 3D (the fourth
installment of the popular franchise),
audiences should prepare themselves
for flying pickaxes, car tyres, severed
heads and gore hurling themselves
at the screen in order to shock and
delight.
The list of sequels this year include
both good and bad franchises: we will
be bored to death in Harry Potter 6
And The Who Really Gives A Crap,
confused and worried that Trans-
formers: Revenge Of The Fallen ever
got made, chilled in Ice Age: Dawn Of
The Dinosaurs and possibly thrilled
in Fast and Furious, which reunites
Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.
At a time when everyone is de-
pressed and vulnerable, serious dra-
mas are also making an (un)happy
return to our screens: Will Smith will
delight and depress in Seven Pounds,
Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio
will captivate in Revolutionary Road,
Brad Pitt will be bland and boring in
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
and if you want an ensemble rom-
com then make sure you watch Jen-
nifer Aniston lead an all-star cast in
He’s Just Not That Into You.
You may think that comic book
adaptations have dried up but appar-
ently they haven’t, with both Watch-
men and X-Men spin-off X-Men Ori-
gins: Wolverine on the horizon. Will
they both live up to the hype? Let us
hope so, as they both look like they
could be good but probably won’t be.
Another highly anticipated film this
year is the sequel/reboot of the popu-
lar Terminator series- Terminator:
Salvation. As it stars Christian Bale
it is sure to be a box-office smash,
however Arnie will not be making an
appearance. Let’s just hope it is more
T2 then the dreadful T3. Another se-
quel/reboot that is filling chat-rooms
and blogs with debate is Star Trek.
Can it impress the die-hard Trekkies?
Seems like filmmakers are catering to
cyberspace fan-boys this year, trying
as hard as they can to cash in on suc-
cessful cult franchises.
More semi-original ideas also
abound this year, as recently divorced
Guy Ritchie directs Robert Downey Jr
in Sherlock Holmes. Hollywood tries
to tackle hit Japanese cartoon series
Dragonball Z with Dragonball: Evo-
lution starring a young American as
Goku, something many fans will be
seething about; children’s favourite
Where The Wild Things Are will final-
ly be released after years of produc-
tion problems; and Pixar will provide
another sterling computer animation
with Monsters vs. Aliens.
Will it be a good year for movies?
This film fan thinks it will be a year of
hits and misses, something that this
decade has been all about. But I will
ride the 00’s out in style, by trying as
hard as possible to fit in as many films
this year as humanly possible. After
all, who needs a social life when you
can go to the cinema instead?
