W
elcome back. I trust
you all have had a
reasonable break to
catch up on work.
No? Thought not.
This term we have some new things
and some old. Of particular interest is
the ethnic Top Trumps game. As you
can see to your right, the game has a
rather controversial mode to it. Let’s
hope the game designer doesn’t get too
much grief over it.
It has come to my attention that the
felix office has become a somewhat
surreal environment. With random
arguments cropping up over the most
random topics, I am beginning to think
the felix office and its employees work,
play and act much like the Original
Video team at collegehumour.com. For
those of you who haven’t visited this
site, do so now. Also watch all the Col-
lege Humour Original videos. They are
freaking hilarious! The minivideoes of
Jake and Amir show exactly the rela-
tionship myself and Kadhim Shubber
have. With all the diverse attitudes here
down in the office, there is always ban-
ter that will spark a debate of strange
likeness. Whether it be about Gaza,
how heavy Christopher Lee is, or even

So you fucked up
bad at your office
Christmas party.
Contrary to popular
decision, that girl
is not for pulling.
However the boss let you off, God knows how
but you just be thankful that for 2009 you will
retain your work in which you very happy. You
must concentrate on not fucking up again, but
I don’t think there’s much chance of that.

Did you know that
in your lifetime you
will poo out 2 tons
of shit? That is un-
less you are a Jade
Goodyesque person,
in which case you will shit out considerably
more. If one is to combine that with the Her-
culean volumes of drivel that you inflict on a
reluctant nation, the conclusion would be met
that you are in fact a useless bint.

I feel like a broken
man. I answered
a ‘Lonely Hearts’
advert... your mum
is huge. I didn’t
know that when
she booked me in, I feel violated. That type of
information should be printed in the advert-
much like the acronym DDF. That means ‘drug
and disease free’ for the less clued up amongst
you, (I do this all the time see). Pint?
Sagittarius
Cancer
So you got a bit
drunk at New Year’s
then... didn’t we
all?!? Humm, not
quite so battered
that we got raped
on the way home though... yeeeno.. no.. that..
that just wouldn’t do. Well it serves you right,
and let that rape child of yours be a lesson in
knowing your limits. Not being a grimy little
slut might help too.

No, piss off. I
refuse to write you
a horoscope. It’s a
much better use of
my time to watch
this:

Seriously it’s really worth listening, if you don’t
laugh felix will buy you a pint. (We will- Ed.)

Why would you
want retina-burning
ginger/blond hair?
Looking like a
lighthouse off the
Dover coast. For
fuck’s sake! So when your girlfriend suggests
that you dye your hair that vibrant colour, why,
oh why would you consider saying yes? Even
if you’re so whipped that when she says jump
you’re already levitating off the ground.
Proper Horoscopes are back, none of that Christmassy shite. Megaz!

If there is ever an excuse to make up
a random game, throw objects at each
other or abuse felix editor Jovan, you
can be sure the worker ants of the felix
office will do it. It is a peculiar way of
life down in the bowels of Be-
it’s West Wing, that some of
us can’t seem to escape. Edi-
tors work late into the nights,
and it has even been known
that some editors have spent
a cold lonely (sometimes not
so lonely) night on the office
sofa. What I am trying to say
here (and doing so very bad-
ly) is that if you ever walk on
down here and see people per-
forming a ceremony around a
plush doll cat in an unfamiliar
cult fashion, don’t be shocked
and call the police.
On that bizarre note, I would
like to ends this week’s insight
into felix by commenting on
the FUCWIT league. We seem
to have two table leaders com-
peting for iPods. Who will be
number one by the end of this
term?

ment League is officially back, and it’s about time we explain what
the hell is going on.
Basically, you get points for doing all the various puzzles and chal-
lenges, and at the end of the year, the winning team will win an iPod
nano! Pretty cool right? The scoring is as follows:
5 points for the first correct answers for Slitherlink, Wordoku, Lon-
don Underground and Quick Crossword. 4 points for second, 3
points for third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point for fifth.
Double points will be awarded for correct cryptic crossword an-
swers, because it’s über hard.
Simple! Now then FUCWITs, send in your answers to felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk or sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Go!

RCC Nighthike
quiz crawl
Oh yes, it’s the Spring term again and
that means exams for many of you, but
you may not know that it also marks
the time to start getting excited about
the Annual RCC Nighthike: one crazy
night of clue-finding, adventurous
walking and hopefully a bit of map
reading – but if you can’t don’t let
that put you off. All this is happening
on the night of 28th February, but to
get you all excited we’ve got a tantalis-
ing taster for you here in the daylight
safety of college. Going along with the
exam time, this week’s clues come to
you from that sanctuary of studying:
the library. All you have to do is track
down the answers and email them in
and then, in the usual RCC way- you
get points, and points mean prizes
1st Floor: What number is the
glass study bubble in the back right
corner of the red zone?
2nd Floor: What is the sequence of
coloured squares on the north wall?
3rd Floor: What does the Science
Museum library have a complete set
of, up to 1992?
4th Floor: What is the name of
the publication by a certain very fa-
mous scientist, which can be found at
631.468.514.239?
5th floor: In the Economist book
of ‘Pocket World in Figures’, what is it
about pages 102 &103 that might ap-
peal to the Imperial stereotype?
Answers in next week’s edition along
with another exciting location around
college to be visited.
