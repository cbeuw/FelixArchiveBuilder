One Hundred Shadows leaves us in the dark
This short novel from Hwang Jungeun promises a magical exploration of post-industrial Korea, but falls short
when it comes to giving us answers.
T
his ethereal short
novel seamlessly
weaves elements
of fantasy with
reality, producing a work
of fiction that is as bizarre
as it is engrossing. Author
Hwang Jungeun affords
us a small glimpse into
the lives of Eungyo and
Mujae, two friends work-
ing at electronic stores.
During a day out,
Eungyo is inexplicably
following a shadow in the
woods, and the temptation
is too great to turn back
until her friend Mujae
asks her what she is doing.
Only in describing the
shadow she is following
does she realise it was
her own. Mujae warns
her, that no matter what
happens, she should never
follow her shadow again
if it rises.
Mujae and Eungyo
work in two different
electronic stores, in the
stores are housed in are to
be demolished, following
the ever-growing trend
of gentrification. The
rise of Eungyo’s shadow
draws the attention of her
employer and Mujae, each
sharing their experiences
with the physical manifes-
tation of shadows, almost
always leading to tragedy.
The relationship
between Mujae and
Eungyo develops, as the
hardships they experience
bring them closer to each
other. This culminates
in the final scene of the
novel, in which Mujae
impulsively buys what
he deems to be a car, and
drives with Eungyo to an
island for the day. Taking
in what the island has
to offer in scenery and
culinarily, they miss the
last ferry off the island. As
the sun sets, and darkness
overwhelms the island’s
inadequate streetlights,
Mujae’s shadow begins
to rise. Eungyo wakes
Mujae from his trance
and they walk into the
night with the shadow
trailing, fearless of what
its presence foreshadows.
The nature and signifi-
cance of these shadows are
ambiguous: they appear
to draw their strength
as their owner weakens,
slowly overcoming them
and their lives. Why
do these shadows rise?
Do they only afflict the
poor or are they simply
a metaphor? These are
questions left unanswered.
Frankly, that confused me
rather than piqued my
curiosity. I confess that it
was difficult to put down
the novel as I sought to
glean more knowledge
of the shadows, but was
left disappointed when
it was not forthcoming.
The novel does touch on
the least advertised aspect
of the South Korean
miracle economic revo-
lution: those left behind
by its inequality. It was
this element that drew
me most upon reading
the synopsis. However,
these were not explored
to any substantial depth,
which was unfortunate as
I believe it would have
added a greater dimen-
sion to the novel. While
its fantastical nature
prompted comparisons to
The Vegetarian by Han
Kang, who wrote the
introduction to the book,
its impact fell far short of
Kang’s masterpiece.

ONE HUNDRED
SHADOWS
by Hwang Jungeun
(translation by Jung
Yewon)
Philip Roth: Mourning the loss of anAmerican literary
giant
Y
ou’re looking,
as you begin,
for what’s
going to resist
you. You’re looking for
trouble. Sometimes in
the beginning uncertainty
arises not because the
writing is difficult, but
because it isn’t difficult
enough.”
These words were
spoken by the late
American author Philip
Roth, who died earlier
this week, at the age of
85, in an interview for the
literary magazine Paris
Review. The interview
took place in the mid-
1980s, well into his long
career, but before he pub-
lished some of his most
critically-acclaimed work.
Born in Newark, New
Jersey, in 1933, Roth grew
up in the neighbourhood
of Weequahic, at a time
of great change. The son
of first generation Jewish
immigrants, he came of
age during the Second
World War, and later
saw the incredible demo-
graphic shifts occurring
in New Jersey, as ‘white
flight’ from Newark to the
suburbs accelerated.
After graduating from
the University of Chicago,
Roth served for two years
in the US Army, before
beginning his writing
career with the publication
of Goodbye, Columbus in
1959. Between then and
today, Roth published
27 novels and novellas,
spanning the range of the
20th
-century American
experience.
Roth’s most celebrat-
ed work was perhaps
his ‘Newark Trilogy’,
which was comprised
of American Pastoral
(1997), I Married a
Communist (1998), and
The Human Stain (2000).
The historian Michael
Kimmage said the trilogy
showed Newark’s “twen-
tieth-century decline from
immigrant metropolis to
post-industrial disaster
[completing] the motif of
history and its terrifying
power over individual
destiny.”
American Pastoral,
which was the first of
Roth’s books I read,
details the life and times of
Seymour ‘Swede’ Levov,
a Jewish-American
businessman, living a suc-
cessful life in mid-century
Newark, a lifestyle that
is upended by the social
and political turmoil of
the 1960s and ‘70s, with
his daughter rejecting her
father’s middle-class life-
style in favour of political
radicalism.
It was one of the books
I took with me when I
went interrailing with
friends, in the endless
summer before universi-
ty; we took turns to read
it, passing it between us,
and marvelling at the way
Roth managed to capture
a whole generation of the
American experience.
Within his work, Roth
was unusually prescient
about what was going on
around him, and, indeed,
what might happen in the
future. His 2004 work,
The Plot Against America,
details an alternative
history, in which the
isolationist Charles Lind-
bergh beats Roosevelt in
the 1940 election, leading
to a rise in antisemitism,
and a refusal to intervene
against Hitler. Lindbergh,
as many have pointed out,
serves as a sort of pro-
to-Trump, supporting the
America First Committee.
In The Human Stain,
too, in which the protag-
onist – a white-passing
mixed race academic – is
accused of racism, Roth
manages to eerily predict
how identity would
become a defining feature
of modern politics.
Roth remains one
of the titans of modern
American literature, up
there with Saul Bellow
or Toni Morrison. His
passing leaves the literary
world just that bit darker.
