Pure Hollywood: a long-anticipated UK debut proves
to be worth the wait

C
a l i f o r n i a ,
despite its
associations in
popular culture
with dreaming and love
and soul, can be an inhos-
pitable place; the beauty
of the sunshine that gives
the state its nickname is
tempered by its power –
to dessicate, oppress, and
crack open, like asphalt
rutted open by an eternal
summer. In her seminal
essay ‘Some Dreamers of
the Golden Dream’, Joan
Didion, whose acuity in
portraying the hollowness
of the everyday is deeply
unsettling, writes of a
California buffeted by the
Santa Ana wind, which
“comes down through
the passes at 100 miles an
hour and whines through
the eucalyptus windbreaks
and works on the nerves.”
It’s a land where “every
voice seems a scream”,
caught in “the season of
suicide and divorce and
prickly dread, wherever
the wind blows.”
These words by Didion
are what come to mind
when reading the pieces
contained within Pure
Hollywood, the latest
collection of short stories
by American writer
Christine Schutt. Despite
the fact that Schutt’s tales
zip all over the American
landscape, they remind
me, at their heart, of the
emptiness commonly
associated with cities like
Los Angeles, of ripeness
curdled into rot, of the
unsettling power of the
Santa Ana wind.
“Christine
Schutt’s stories
make me think
of ripeness
turned to rot,
and the Santa
Ana wind”
“Schutt
writes with
a detached
prose style,
and body
horror to rival
Cronenberg”
The stories, which
range greatly in length,
from several dozen pages
through to a couple of
paragraphs, are concerned
with lonely, maladjusted
individuals, struggling to
make their way through
life. A horse trek through
mountainous terrain sees
a woman plagued with un-
certainty; a young actress
goes to the stage lot while
her older husband has
a cardiac arrest in the
swimming pool; a widow
sinks into a slumber of
anger and fear and drink.
Schutt writes with a
detached prose style,
keeping her subjects at
arm’s length, making use
of this distance to create
a sense of the uncanny.
It’s a deeply unsettling
technique, one aided and
abetted by her skill in
creating a sense of bodily
horror to rival Cronen-
berg.
In ‘Species of Special
Concern’, for example, an
unanticipated TSA search
takes a couple by surprise
– “They hadn’t expected a
pat-down at security, and
tried to explain what was
inside Nancy that made
the machines beep”. Or
in the two-page ‘Where
Do You Live? When You
Need Me’, which takes
place one hot New York
summer in the 1980s, a
season “when little parts
of little bodies turned up
in KFC buckets in dump-
sters in the city…weeks
of record heat and brown
air”.
This neutral horror is
perhaps most brilliantly
explored in ‘The Hedges’,
in which a wealthy couple
take their two-year old
child to a holiday resort.
From the start, Schutt sets
up a delicious tension:
with the child suffering
from an unspecified
illness, she describes the
“clotted, green-sound of
her little boy’s breathing,
an unwell honk that did
not blend in with the
sashaying pants and
beachy-wet breeze of the
island.” The family drift
around the resort under
a cloud of frustration
and resentment, with
the mother Lolly, only
interested in the answer
to the question “how long
did motherhood last?”.
The son is described in a
way that makes the gorge
rise in the throat: “cereal
stuck to him, as it would
to anything that oozed.”
And, of course, things
inevitably come crashing
down on the family, and
– likewise – on the reader.
There is an existential
threat lurking in the corner
of all of Schutt’s stories,
a sense of inevitable
tragedy, slick with cold
sweat, that inhabits her
pages. Planned picnics are
suffused with a migraine
aura of resentment – “the
food they ate was too
salty or too dry: no tastes
to speak of” – while
characters are assailed
by the world outside
the bubbles they have
constructed: “muted new
flickers on the flat screen:
gaudy mayhem.” And
while Schutt’s characters
may have “pooh-poohed
the ominous signs”, the
readers cannot.
Schutt’s prose style
is a thing of wonder and
frustration: she constructs
her sentences full of inter-
jections and meanderings,
drawing the reader in a
circuitous route towards
their destination. Fre-
quently dry and curt,
Schutt will sucker punch
the reader with a series
of barbs, before deliver-
ing sentences of lyrical
beauty and grace, which
stand out like sharp cacti
in a flat desert. The end
sentence to her story ‘The
Lady from Connecticut’,
for example:
“Cars pass, several in a
row, from a party, perhaps,
following each other
home – sober drivers, she
hopes, soberer than she,
yet she moves back in the
ditch, which isn’t a ditch
so much as a broad rut
filled with fallen leaves
and broken branches,
fieldstone and mist rising
over a landscape pierced
as quaintly as a quilt, and
the lady from Connecticut,
a loose stitch in it.”
The stories in Pure Hol-
lywood are prickly things
indeed. Schutt’s vision is
flat and unflinching and
unforgiving, like a photo
taken with too much flash.
Like a flash, however, the
collection lingers in the
mind, imprinting itself
upon my closed eyelids
long after I put it down.
The Santa Ana wind runs
through Shutt’s pages,
rattling skeletons, kicking
up dust, and, always,
turning the page.
Schutt’s stories are dry and ironic, keeping a distance between reader and subject // Wikimedia
