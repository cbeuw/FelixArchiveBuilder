Mobile phones make you hyper-social, not anti-social!

A
s we grow
older, we
begin to adopt
a routine. This
commences from the ear-
liest of ages – from when
we learn to brush our teeth
in the morning, to sleep-
ing at a particular time
at night. With the advent
of modern technology,
checking our phones has
also become embedded in
our everyday lives. Many
say this is an example of
how anti-social we are all
becoming. Never is this
more evident than on the
tube in London, as many
travellers stare intently at
their phones, as opposed
to engaging in conversa-
tion. This phenomenon
has been described as
puzzling by many for-
eigners, so-much-so that
one American man took
matters into his own
hands and created a badge
labelled, “Tube chat?,” to
get us talking! As expect-
ed, this was not received
well at all, with a counter
badge marked, “No chat
please, we’re British,”
being created.
haviour, many would say
some action needs to be
taken. Controversially, it
has also been argued that
phones have made humans
more social, as we are able
to communicate with indi-
viduals on the other side
of the globe – an option
previously unavailable to
our ancestors. Although
the population spends a
great deal of time on their
phones, this phenomenon
may just be an example
of how addicted we are to
social interactions, further
exemplifying the funda-
mental desire of humans
wishing to connect with
one another. This can be
traced back through evo-
lution: we have developed
to become a distinctively
social species that requires
constant input, not only
from our surroundings,
but from other humans,
to guide appropriate
language and behaviour.
Consequently, this enables
humans to find a sense of
identity and meaning, as
well as creating a specific
goal!
Following a review
of literature on the dys-
functional use of smart
technology, using an
evolutionary perspective,
Moriah Stendel and
Professor Veissière from
McGill University con-
cluded the following: a
mutual theme shared by
the most addictive smart-
phone functions was the
abilityto tap into the desire
of humans to connect with
other humans! This is
particularly evident with
social media, where we
wish to watch and monitor
others, as well as be seen
and monitored ourselves!
A healthy urge, or an
unhealthy addiction?
This hyper-social
behaviour which smart-
phones tend towards is
argued to be somewhat
important for normal and
healthy needs of sociality.
However, the pace and
scale of this phenomena
can result in an overdrive
of the brain’s reward
system – leading to an
unhealthy addiction! One
such example can be
seen in our eating habits:
following the industrial
revolution, where food
the social rewards that
can be attained through
the use of smart-phones
can similarly become
unbalanced, producing an
unhealthy environment of
hyper-social monitoring.
Consequently, the
answer is not found in
the renunciation of your
mobile phone! If you
wish to control or reduce
addictive tendencies, it is
suggested that you could
benefit from switching
off push notifications
and adopting a schedule
of when to check your
phone. Furthermore,
research has also sug-
gested that the common
workplace policies of
prohibiting evening and
weekend emails are
healthy, helping to control
these hyper-social ten-
dencies. Adopting small
changes in your schedule
can ensure you maintain
the healthy social balance
us humans require!
New reseach shows the most addictive smartphone functions are those that connect us to our fellow human
beings, suggesting they feed our deep-seated drive for communication.

Solar cells absorb 20% more light with nanoscale
coating
The efficiency of solar cells has received a big boost from a tiny source.

R
esearchers at
the National
Institute of
Standards and
Technology (NIST) have
developed a nanoscale
coating for solar cells.
These are made of thou-
sands of glass beads of
sulphur dioxide, each no
larger than one-hundredth
of the width of a human
hair.
The coating creates
an optical ‘whispering
gallery’ effect around
each solar cell. Acoustic
whispering galleries
are curved structures,
whereby a person at one
end of a wall can hear
a faint noise from any
part of the wall. When
light hits the beads, the
waves travel around its
entire shape, in the same
way that sound waves
travel around a curved
wall. This traps the light,
and so creates a more
concentrated light source.
The light then seeps out
to be absorbed by a solar
cell composed of gallium
Results indicated
that coated solar cells
absorbed 20% more light
and produced 20% more
current than uncoated
cells. As a laser was used
as a light source, it is still
yet to be seen whether
the same results can be
produced outside of the
lab in solar panels. Nev-
ertheless, this is a crucial
step for renewable energy
technology.
The development is
even more impressive
considering that the re-
searchers have prepared
the technology for mass
production. Previous
methods of applying
coating to solar cells
involved incredibly high
temperatures, making
the process expensive.
Typical methods are also
time-consuming as both
sides of the solar cell are
coated when only one
is necessary. The new
method involves applying
the nanoscale coating to
only one side of the cell.
A wire-wound metal rod
is then pulled across the
cell, so that the coating
becomes spread out, and
so the tiny glass beads are
more tightly packed. This
can take place at room
temperature, lowering
production costs consid-
erably.
This development
helps pave the way for
high-efficiency and
low-cost solar cells.
