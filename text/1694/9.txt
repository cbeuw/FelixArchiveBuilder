A night of wicked cabaret takes us back in time
T
his new collab-
oration between
the English
National Opera
and Gate Theatre brings
together a collection
of songs from Weimar
era Germany, banned
by the Nazis for being
‘un-German’. The title
itself is taken from a
Nazi document produced
for propagandist Hans
Ziegler’s 1938 exhibition
of these banned songs,
intended to highlight their
degeneracy and justify
their banning. Many of the
songs were by Jewish and
black musicians, as well
as containing themes that
ran counter to Nazi ideals.
Effigies of Wickedness fea-
tures a selection of these
songs, performed in order
of chronology, effectively
creating a journey through
time, starting in 1920 with
songs celebrating Weimar
subversion, through to
1938 and the advent of
the Second World War.
It combines elements of
opera, musical theatre,
and cabaret in an ambi-
tious effort to combine the
genres.
The production stars
opera singers Peter
Brathwaite and Katie
Bray, alongside actor/
performer Lucy McCor-
mick, and cabaret star
and drag performer Le
Gateau Chocolat. Whilst
they all deliver excellent
performances, their
different backgrounds
are clear from the begin-
ning. Whilst Bray and
Brathwaite are clearly
amazing singers, their
lack of cabaret experience
is clear in their audience
interactions. Bray is bril-
liant in her duet of ‘Best
Girlfriends’, a 1928 ode
to lesbian love by Misha
Spoliansky, but fades into
the background outside of
her song performances.
Lisa McCormick is
almost the very opposite:
she starts out uneven –
there is even a remark
following her duet with
Bray in ‘Best Girlfriends’
that this ‘isn’t her strong-
est number’ – but as the
we progress further in
time, towards the 1930s
and darker subject matter,
she really comes into her
own. Her performance
of the song ‘Paragraph
218 (Abortion is Illegal)’
about a young woman
being denied an abortion
despite being almost des-
titute, is one of the most
haunting and powerful
performances of the night.
The clear star of the show,
however, is Le Gateau
Chocolat, who stands
out in almost every per-
formance, transitioning
effortlessly from comic
to saucy, and, towards the
end of the night, to tragic
figure. Its almost impossi-
ble to focus on any of the
other performers when Le
Gateau Chocolat is domi-
nating the stage.
The staging of the
show is in some ways the
weakest link in this pro-
duction. The Gate Theatre
is an unusual location,
notable mainly for its
small size and somewhat
claustrophobic seating
arrangement. This is
referenced by the stars on
more than one occasion,
with remarks comparing
it to a ‘cupboard’ and Lisa
McCormick’s joke on it
being a far cry from the
ENO’s usual home at The
Coliseum.
What the jokes say are
true though, and the pro-
duction really is rather let
down by its venue – the
stage is small, and limits
what the cast can do, es-
pecially as they are joined
by their musicians on the
stage.
Its shiny black design,
and the jumble of props
at centre stage, are a
brave choice, but one that
doesn’t pay off. If the aim
was to capture the air of a
location in 1920s Berlin,
it fails miserably and
comes across more like
the stage of an amateur
performance. It has one
advantage though: it
creates a sense of intimacy
with the performers,
enhanced by the perform-
ers’ interactions with the
audience. The interactions
with the musicians does
also go towards capturing
what might have been the
atmosphere of a 1920s
Berlin bar. Even so, you
can’t help but think that
such an ambitious col-
laboration is worthy of a
larger venue.
Overall, I wasn’t sure
what to make of this
production. It combines
opera, cabaret, and
dramatic theatre together
to create something
almost wholly new. This
feels like a mishmash, but
an intentional one, and
the combination of genres
and artforms perhaps adds
to the spirit of subversion
it is trying to capture. It’s
a bold endeavour and one
that pays off: it succeeds in
combining the genres into
one enjoyable evening. If
you’re a fan of cabaret,
opera, or just fancy some-
thing different, then a trip
to this production at Gate
Theatre is definitely one
worth taking.
The collaboration between ENO and the Gate Theatre brings together a set of songs banned by the Nazis for
being ‘un-German’ – it’s a fantastical evening, which deserves a bigger setting.
