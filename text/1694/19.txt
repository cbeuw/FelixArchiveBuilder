Think you can take the heat? Read on!
Method
1. Add oil to a frying pan and heat it.
Add enough to cover the base of the frying
pan, more according to your personal lik-
ing. With too little oil, the mince will not
be fragrant and crispy enough. Too much
may make it greasy and unhealthy as well.
2. When the smoke of the oil rises, add
the mince. Stir fry the mince until the col-
our turns golden brown. Make sure the heat
is not too high and stir it frequently.
3. Add in Pixian bean sauce and Sze-
chuan pepper. Stir fry the mixture. Check
the colour of the oil – hopefully it will turn
red!
4. Add in the tofu, chilli powder, and
the boiling water. Enough water is needed
to cover 3/4 the height of the tofu. Boiling
water in the kettle saves lots of time!
5. Wait until only half of the tofu is sub-
merged in water. Pour in half of the starch
water. You can do this by slowly pouring
the starch water along the circumference of
the pan. Wait for another five minutes and
add the remaining starch water.
6. Taste the tofu and sprinkle over the
green onions. It’s up to you when you want
to stop heating. Personally, I would turn off
the heat early and utilise the surplus heat
for a minute or two.
7. Done! Get your rice, mix them up,
and bon appétit!
I
f you have ever heard
about my hometown
Szechuan, there is
a 99.9% probability
that you would relate it
with spicy food. Apart
from the famous Szechuan
Hotpot, with loads of chilli
floating on the surface,
Mapo Tofu is irresistible
if you fancy spicy food. It
is also a perfect vegetarian
or vegan choice if you add
no mince into it. There
are several variations of
Mapo Tofu, including a
Japanese version, which is
well known as one of the
spiciest meals there.
‘Mapo Tofu’ is named
after an old lady, nick-
named ‘Mapo’ (‘an old
woman with pockmarked
face’ in Chinese) in
Szechuan who owned a
small and inconspicuous
restaurant. She cooked
extremely delicious tofu
with chilli and beef, which
then became popular by
word of mouth, and is
now well known all over
the world.
In my hometown,
Mapo Tofu is famous for
the ‘numbness’ feeling
in your mouth, instead
of ‘spicy’. This special
feeling, which is coin-
cidentally referred to as
‘Ma’ as well, is caused
by Szechuan peppers.
According to Harold
McGee in On Food and
Cooking, “they produce a
strange, tingling, buzzing,
numbing sensation that is
something like the effect
of carbonated drinks or of
a mild electric current”.
Anyway, you will discover
the mystery if you have a
try!
The red colour and
spicy taste mainly comes
from Pixian bean sauce
and chilli powder, which
can be easily found in
Chinese supermarkets in
Chinatown. Pixian bean
sauce is widely used in
Szechuan cuisine. It is a
spicy and salty paste made
from fermented broad
beans, red peppers, and
various spices.
For me, rice is without
question the best compan-
ion to Mapo Tofu. (It’s
even better to mix this
dish in with rice). Don’t
worry if you can’t handle
spicy food very well,
simply add as much or as
little Pixian bean sauce or
chilli powder as you like
and you’ll get a personal-
ised edition of Mapo Tofu.
Mapo Tofu
Ingredients
• Oil
• 500g tofu
• 2-3 spring onions
• 15-20g Pixian bean
sauce
• Chilli powder (as
much as you like)
• 3g Szechuan pepper
• 50g beef mince (you
can substitute pork
mince instead)
• Starch (ideally pota-
to starch)
• Water
1. Cut tofu into small cubes, around 2cm
in length.
2. Chop the spring onions into small seg-
ments.
3. Chop the beans and chilli skins in the
Pixian Bean Sauce (to make the dish look
better).
4. Add a pinch of salt into the mince, stir-
ring the mince to make sure it’s well blend-

mally 1:1.5 starch to water by volume. (You
may need to remix it again before addition
since it is an unstable turbid liquid.)
