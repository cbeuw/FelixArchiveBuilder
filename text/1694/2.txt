Staff at Imperial working unpaid overtime nearly two
days a week
than £160,000 was greater
than the combined annual
increase of the remaining
7,489 members of staff. A
Felix investigation earlier
this year revealed Impe-
rial spending on senior
staff is greater than that of
any other Russell Group
university. In 2017, the
College spent £5.6 million
on 20 key management
personnel – an average
salary of £280,000 each.
At the time, a College
spokesperson said pay
increases across the board
were “weighted in favour
of lower paid staff, as has
happened for the past two
years”.
“Our success depends
upon attracting world-
class talent and our re-
muneration reflects that,”
they added.
In the pay claim, the
unions report: “Last year
we were told that the
Provost Board thought
it best to ‘taper’ cost of
living increases to allow a
redistribution to the lower
paid. The actual very
much larger redistribution
to the highest paid was not
mentioned.
“Affordability has
not been an issue as far
as the highest paid are
concerned,” the unions
continue.
Claims over affordabil-
ity fuelled anger over pro-
posed changes to pension
schemes and led to strikes
at universities across the
country earlier this year.
Tom Pike, vice pres-
ident of Imperial UCU,
told Felix: “The strike
over pensions shouldn’t
be seen as a one-off
grumble by staff at Im-
perial. There has been a
long-term erosion of pay,
specifically seen against
the increase in living costs
in London, that has out-
stripped national figures.
“It’s both the squeeze
on the value of current
salaries and the threats
to future pensions that
have made staff so upset,
especially when we’ve re-
cently seen a burgeoning
salary bill for the highest
paid.
internal surpluses.
“Clearly, the College
has chosen to devote its
surplus to buildings rather
than to staff,” the unions
write.
Working Hours
A survey carried out
by UCU in 2016 found
Imperial staff work an
average of 50 hours each
week. The legal maximum
working week is 48 hours.
According to the
unions’ pay claim:
“Overall, academics gave
nearly two days of work
per week to Imperial for
free.” It continues: “Every
year members of staff
are donating thousands
of pounds to Imperial
College and risking their
health as they do so.”
The UCU survey
reports the workloads of
almost three quarters of
Imperial staff increased
in pace and intensity over
the previous three years.
Almost a quarter of staff
said their workload was
unmanageable most or all
of the time.
The unions have also
criticised Imperial for
employing more aca-
demics on “unnecessary”
fixed-term contracts,
which are “out of line”
with similar universities,
which employ staff on
open-ended contracts. In
the pay claim they state:
“Fixed-term contracts are
particularly difficult for
members of staff, making
it difficult to obtain decent
housing, plan ahead or
develop careers.” Fixed-
term contracts also make
it harder for the College to
“build successful, stable
teams of researchers and
teachers”.
Data provided by the
unions show in 2015/16
over 55% of academic
staff were on fixed-term
contracts, compared to 4%
at neighbouring Russell
Group university UCL.
To improve working
conditions, the unions
have called for action to
prevent Imperial staff
routinely working beyond
their contractual working
hours and “to harmonise
contractual hours at 35
[hours per] week”. The
unions are also asking for
an “agreement” to reduce
the number of staff hired
on fixed-term contracts
and to convert existing
fixed-term contracts into
open-ended contracts.
highest salary quartile are
men (the highest propor-
tion among Russell Group
universities); 56% of
those in the second-high-
est salary quartile are also
men. Women at Imperial
are also less likely to be
awarded a bonus and
receive half the value of
the median bonus granted
to men. The College
states that this discrep-
ancy because there are
“fewer women in senior
positions, and bonus pay-
ments are proportional to
individuals’ salaries”.
At the time, Provost
James Stirling said: “We
do not consider [the
gender pay gap] accept-
able. We are committed
to addressing this imbal-
ance by tackling barriers
to progression.” The
joint trade unions have
described the College’s
response as “complacent”
and note that “College has
published no plans to take
new action”. The unions
are calling for a commit-
ment to close the gender
pay gap by 2020.
Affordability of pensions was a sore point in the recent industrial action. // Joseph O'Connell-Danes
“The unions
stated 'clearly,
the College
has chosen
to devote
its surplus
to buildings
rather than to
staff”
“This is an unsustain-
able position if Imperial
wants to recruit and retain
the best staff,” he added.
At the time, Imperial
supported the proposed
changes – which could
have seen staff lose up to
60% of their pension value
– and said they were “nec-
essary” as the shortfall in
pension funds (reported to
be £7.5 billion) was “not
likely to be sustainable”.
Suggestions that Im-
perial could not afford to
continue under the current
pension scheme were
attacked at the time in
light of the College’s ex-
tensive property holdings.
Earlier this year, Felix
revealed the College has
£179.1 million invested
in property and spent ap-
proximately £200 million
on its estate. The trade
unions further report that,
while staff expenditure
has decreased, Imperi-
al’s capital expenditure
has risen: since 2011,
Imperial has spent more
than £1.42 billion. Up to
£928 million is estimated
to have stemmed from
“55% of
Imperial
academics
were on fixed-
term contracts,
compared to
4% at UCL”
Gender Pay Gap
Female employees are
also worse off. As previ-
ously reported in Felix,
women at Imperial earn a
median of 9.4% less than
men and a mean of 19.4%
less per hour. The mean
pay gap may be explained
by decreasing numbers
of women in each subse-
quent pay band: 70% of
Imperial employees in the

The strikes were just the start
C
ast your mind
back to last
term. I know it’s
difficult – you’re
just reading this as an
excuse to avoid revising
for another soul-crushing
hour – but try. You might
remember there was a
period of four weeks
where our academic and
support staff – along
with colleagues up and
down the country – went
on strike in opposition to
the proposed changes to
their pension plans. The
strike came to an end,
Universities UK agreed to
go back to the negotiating
table, and the changes
were postponed, at least
for the immediate future.
Some may believe the
problems highlighted in
the pensions dispute have
now been solved. They
have not. The debate,
although on the surface
about pension pay, was,
for many, about something
much deeper: the ongoing
privatisation of the higher
education sector. And,
as this week’s lead story
shows, the effects this
move is having on our
lecturers and support staff
is immense.
Since 2005, Imperial
staff have seen their pay
cut in real terms by 1.1%
each and every year; at
the same time, many of
them are facing increased
workloads, a blurring of
the work/life boundary,
increasingly metric-based
assessment of their work,
and casualisation of their
employment. Staff at
Imperial are being made
worse off, year on year,
and – realistically – this
is a situation that cannot
last. Universities are in-
stitutions that run, at their
core, on a sense of good
will. Staff will regularly
work beyond their allotted
hours, or complete tasks
that aren’t included within
their workflow, because
they genuinely love
teaching and research;
they make a choice to,
often, be paid much less
than they might do if
they went into the private
sector, in order to follow
their passions for science
and education.
When speaking about
university jobs, many
people will view them
as similar to those in the
public sector; and they
should – Imperial gets
vast amounts of money
each year from the public
purse to fund research that
can have a massive impact
on the world. But if we
are to view Imperial jobs
as public sector ones, and
use this to justify a lower
salary than in the private
sector, then certain trade-
offs need to be made.
Public sector jobs should
have good pensions. That
hasn’t been the case.
Public sector jobs should
offer security. That hasn’t
been the case. Public
sector jobs shouldn’t
demand hellish hours.
That has not been the case.
Meanshile, in senior
management, salaries
have continued to soar
in recent years: 130 staff
now earn more than the
Prime Minister, with the
most senior members of
management earning on
average £280,000 each.
These figures, combined
with the fact Imperial
made nearly £120 million
in surplus last year, are a
slap in the face for staff
who have been facing
real-term pay cuts over
the past decade.
This article is the cul-
mination of a trend that
is having an impact, not
only at Imperial (although
the effects are arguably
more pronounced here),
but across the entire UK.
The fight for the future of
our education didn’t begin
and end with the industrial
action. It is not resolved. It
is ongoing. And we need
to continue to fight it.
