SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCH HIGH
ALTITUDE BALLOON
The members of the IC
Students for the Explora-
tion and Development of
Space Society (ICSEDS)
headed out on 21st
April to Elsworth, near
Cambridge, to launch
a balloon from an open
field up to 30km into the
atmosphere. On board we
had our Arduino powered
tracker transmitting its
GPS coordinates to us
on the ground packed in
a livid orange box, and a
360° camera sticking out
from the bottom on the
end of a metre-long selfie
stick. The weather was
excellent for a high-alti-
tude balloon launch, with
only somewhat mild wind
(anything stronger would
have carried our precious
balloon into the middle
of the North Sea). The
sky could not have been
clearer, letting us capture
some clear shots and
keeping us warm as we
prepped the payload for
launch.
After filling the balloon
with helium up to a
pre-calculated weight,
testing our tracker a
few times, and double
checking the camera was
recording, we let go of the
balloon, and it drifted off
into the blue sky. We set
off in a van, following the
balloon across the English
countryside. Soon, as the
balloon rose to a few kilo-
metres in altitude, amateur
radio stations in the area
started also picking up our
beacon, helping map out
the balloon’s trajectory as
it sped off at 18m/s to the
north east.
Then, in an unexpected
turn, at an altitude of
about 15 km, we started
losing telemetry. The
radio signals from our
two independent trackers
remained strong, but the
data we received was
all 0s. There seemed to
be some fault with the
onboard GPS equipment.
Determined not to lose
track of our balloon, we
drove to the point on the
map above which we had
earlier predicted it would
reach the apex of its trajec-
tory. Since the atmosphere
thins out rapidly with
altitude, the air currents
above ~20 km are far
too weak and the balloon
went directly up above
us. Using a metre-long
directional radio antenna
we determined the rough
angle between us and the
balloon, and were able to
confirm that it was indeed
above us. At that point we
had about half an hour to
wait, during which time
the balloon would rise
to its peak altitude, the
balloon itself would burst,
and the payload would
fall rapidly towards the
ground with a small para-
chute. As the payload falls
below around 15 km, the
air gets thick enough for
the parachute to slow it
down, and for atmospheric
currents to start carrying
it laterally. At this point,
we would need to chase it
once more in our van, and
track where the payload
touches down.
We got lucky, however,
and one of our GPS
trackers resumed trans-
mitting accurate data
before our payload passed
back below the 15km
line. As we later found
out, the malfunction was
likely due to the oscillator
crystal getting too cold
on the GPS chips, as tem-
perature dropped sharply
with altitude, causing their
internal clocks to be too
inaccurate to make sense
of the GPS signal. As the
payload fell back down
into warmer atmosphere,
and the oscillator warmed
back up, the chip returned
to its intended function
with no ill effects. (You
may have heard that GPS
chips are designed to
stop functioning above a
certain altitude, but ours
were designed to not have
this limitation so they
could be used in a high
altitude flight.)
With our telemetry
signal restored, first on
one, then on both trackers,
we could easily follow
the payload’s descent as it
was getting traced out au-
tomatically on a map, and
followed it to its landing
spot on the Great Mass-
ingham Airfield, Norfolk.
We called up the airfield
owner, who helped us
recover our orange box.
The trip back to London
was spent looking over
the footage from the
camera, and hoping not
to get stuck in Saturday
evening traffic (which we
did).
Overall, the balloon
drifted for over two hours
before bursting as we had
planned, at an altitude
of around 30 km. The
all-important payload de-
scended on our parachute,
which proved to have been
the right size for the job.
Our tracking had worked
during the most crucial
part (descent and after
landing), and arguably the
most fragile part of our
payload (the 360 camera
with its two exposed
fisheye lenses) had been
protected sufficiently to
survive a landing at over 4
m/s. All valuable data for
our future launches, which
will involve more serious
scientific experiments.
We would love to
collaborate in future
launches with those inter-
ested in sending a payload
up to an altitude of 30km.
With most of the atmos-
phere below, we can get
excellent views of space,
accurate atmospheric
data, and, depending on
the weather, a clear view
of the ground below.
We are always looking
for new collaborators to
expand the size of our
projects. Do not hesitate
to get in touch!
