Nailed It!, Netflix, and the death of modern TV
Netflix and other streaming services have brought with them a new raft of options for TV enthusiasts, but as
they spread their resources thinner and thinner, hoping to get another hit, the viewers are losing out, lost amid a
increasing pool of crap.

“Netflix’s
growth has
led to a deluge
of trite, dull,
trashy shows
flooding our
screens”
I
n 1978, the author
and activist Jerry
Mander released
a book entitled
Four Arguments for the
Elimination of Television.
Mander, who had worked
in the advertising world
for 15 years before turn-
ing his attention more
fully to activism, argued
television was not a neu-
tral technology, but rather
contained within it an in-
trinsic power to misinform
and control populations.
“What is revealed in the
end,” Mander wrote, “is
that there is ideology in
the technology itself. To
speak of television as
‘neutral’ and therefore
subject to change is as
absurd as speaking of the
reform of a technology
such as guns.”
I would like to propose
a fifth argument for the
elimination of television:
the existence of the TV
show Nailed It! The series
– which must be the first
example of a television
series being inspired
solely by a meme – sees
three amateur bakers
attempt to construct com-
plicated culinary creations
while host Amanda Byer
provides gently sarcas-
tic commentary. The
emphasis is on ‘amateur’,
rather than ‘baker’: unlike
The Great British Bake
Off, where contestants can
knock up a dozen perfect
macarons in their sleep,
the people brought on in
Nailed It! are home cooks
through and through.
Cakes are iced warm, tiers
collapse, and the sugar
sculptures look like some-
thing from House of Wax.
Nailed It! is, as you
may have guessed, a
Netflix original – one of
the roughly 700 films
and TV programmes the
streaming giant plans
to release this year. The
cost of bringing this
sheer amount of content
to the provider’s 104
million global subscribers
is no small feat: their
content budget for this
year currently stands at
around $8 billion, roughly
equivalent to the GDP of
Haiti. A large proportion
of this money will go
on the service’s flagship
productions, such as
monarchy-based drama
The Crown, whose first
season cost a reported
$130 million to make.
This growth has
another cost, however,
and that is the deluge of
trite, dull, trashy shows
that are currently flooding
our screens. Series like
Bojack Horseman and
films like Alex Garland’s
Annihilation are like
pieces of flotsam amid a
tidal wave of mediocrity,
and, as Netflix is increas-
ingly aggressive in its
pursuit of original content,
it seems likely things will
only worsen.
How did we get to this
position? Just a few short
years ago, Netflix seemed
to be the salvation for
TV in the modern age,
a platform that could
fund and promote high
quality content to fill our
screens. Netflix’s first
breakthrough – six years
after they began offering
streamed content – was
with the release of the
first series of House of
Cards, which was their
first original piece of
programming. While they
had previously been sat-
isfied with merely being
a platform for the work
of others, with House of
Cards they began to shape
their image as major tele-
vision producers.
They swiftly followed
this up with Orange is the
New Black, an ensemble
drama about incarcerated
women that married
showrunner Jenji Kohan’s
bold, colourful vision with
intersectional feminism.
Those two shows, alone,
garnered eleven Emmy
awards, and two Golden
Globes for Netflix.
At the time, these
shows seemed to mark a
turning point for the tel-
evision industry coming
along just as we were
beginning to reach the
end of the golden age of
TV. The series of tragic
prestige dramas, most
notably embodied in
The Sopranos, had their
final hurrah with AMC’s
masterpiece Mad Men,
which remains a reference
point for high-quality,
slow-burn television.
As we bid farewell to
Donald Draper and Peggy
Olsen, however, there was
concern over what might
come next, and streaming
services stepped in to fill
the void. Indeed, going
back to a little under a
decade ago, we seemed
to be on the precipice of
a new cultural landscape:
water cooler discussions
were being replaced with
binge-watching, Twitter
provided a new platform
for real-time critiquing,
and the phrase ‘Netflix
and chill’ entered into our
shared lexicon. In 2015
and 2016, the Pulitzer
Prize for Criticism was
awarded to TV critics,
seemingly cementing
the central role TV was
having on the entertain-
ment landscape.
There is no doubt that
this second wind can be
attributed to streaming
services; while Netflix
planted the flag, becoming
most closely associated
with the new generation of
prestige dramas, Amazon
Studios and Hulu were
quick on its heels, with
series like Transparent
and The Handmaid’s Tale
picking up accolades left,
right, and centre.
What Nailed It!
shows, however, is how
this relationship has
soured, and the promised
golden age has become
an ever-receding dream.
How did we get from Mad Men and The Sopranos… // AMC/HBO
“The main
question
Nailed It!
prompts is
why does such
a show exist
in the first
place?”
“Streaming
services are
channeling
their resources
into making
sure every click
is directed
towards self-
produced
content”
As Netflix increasingly
pivot to self-produced
content, works of true
quality are becoming
harder to make out: in
return for The Crown,
we have to have The Get
Down (cancelled after a
single drawn-out season);
for every Unbreakable
Kimmy Schmidt there is a
Girlboss (described as ‘so
unrelentingly tone-deaf
to the human condition
it’s hard to know where
to start’); and meanwhile
good quality shows like
Midnight Diner: Tokyo
Stories get pushed off the
landing page.
And this isn’t even
beginning to consider the
impact streaming services
are having on the film
industry. In particular, the
Cannes Film Festival has
been waging a war against
Netflix, last year announc-
ing all films screening in
the festival would need to
have a theatrical distribu-
tion in French cinemas; in
response, Netflix pulled
all their entries from this
year’s festival, including
those that didn’t fall under
the distribution rules.
David Sims, staff writer
for The Atlantic, has
called Netflix’s corporate
strategy “aggressive
and unusual even for a
streaming company”,
but has predicted Cannes
will soon cave in, facing
the sheer glut of Netflix
releases, which is consist-
ently growing.
This mania isn’t helped
by the lack of comprehen-
sive data on what exactly
people are watching,
which can make it increas-
ingly difficult to decide
what to watch. Netflix has
been notoriously secretive
about what exactly its
customers are watching
– Nielsen previously
announced a new service
to measure how many
people were watching
episodes of individual
TV shows on streaming
services, but Netflix were
quick to point out the
data were “not accurate,
not even close, and do
not reflect the viewing of
these shows on Netflix.”
It is unclear whether
Netflix wants to hide these
viewing figures in order to
gain a competitive edge
over the competition, to
help hide which shows are
performing poorly, or for
any other reason. Earlier
this year, a report was
released by 7Park Data,
which claimed Netflix
originals only made up
about 20% of viewing
figures on the platform,
with the remainder being
people watching licensed
content, which Netflix
has purchased from other
producers. Netflix refused
to comment.
What this secrecy does
mean, is that it’s increas-
ingly difficult for the
average viewer to decide
what to watch. Previously,
TV addicts could look to
the ratings to see which
shows were getting the
largest audiences, and
would be worth their time
– of course, popularity
doesn’t directly correlate
to quality, but it can be a
good proxy, allowing us
to know what we should
see to keep up with the
changing cultural land-
scape. Today, viewers
need to rely on positive
write-ups in papers or on
websites, or on recom-
mendations through social
media, to know what they
should be tuning into.
This, combined with
the sheer quantity of
programmes now avail-
able, puts the viewer in a
vulnerable position, with
ever-increasing choice
and an ever-diminishing
ability to tell the wheat
from the chaff.
Netflix has exploited
that gulf: as soon as you
navigate to the Netflix
website, you’re greeted
with an advert for
whatever Netflix Original
they’re currently plugging
(at the time of writing it’s
Dear White People, the
satirical college series,
based off the slight-
ly-shaky film of the same
name by Justin Simien).
Scroll down, and you’re
presented with another
raft of Netflix Originals
to pick from; as you keep
on scrolling down, and
the categories get more
complex, you’re almost
always guarenteed to
see the little red ‘Netflix’
denoting original content
at multiple points on the
screen.
The question that this
brings us back to, then,
especially when consider-
ing that quality of shows
like Nailed It! is whether
or not the programmes
Netflix are pushing are
because they’re suited
to us, or simply because
they’re made by Netflix.
In an effort to stay ahead
of the tough competition,
the streaming services are
channeling their resources
into making sure every
click, hit, or view is
directed towards content
they produce and own.
And the result is dimin-
ishing returns for us – the
consumers.
Netflix needs to take
a break, and decide what
kind of platform it wants
to be, rather than trying to
be all things at once. But,
with Barack Obama cur-
rently in talks to produce
shows for Netflix, it
seems unlikely the stream
of content will ever stop.
…to Girlboss and Nailed It!? // Netflix
Nailed It! isn’t a par-
ticularly bad show. It’s
well-meaning and warm,
wearing its game show
format lightly. But as a
piece of programming, the
main question it prompts
is why? Why does such a
show exist? Who pitched
it to Netflix, and why was
it funded? Buoyed on by
the success of their early
shows, Netflix seems
desperate to replicate
the success of its early
days, but rather than
channeling their ever-in-
creasing reserves into a
few choice projects, they
are spreading it among as
many things as possible,
hoping some will make it
big on the off chance. The
result is chaotic. With new
shows and films being
released every week, it’s
paradoxically more and
more difficult for the
viewer to find stuff worth
watching; we’re like
Buridan’s ass, trapped in
front of an endless sea of
choice, but paralysed into
indecision.
