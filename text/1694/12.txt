On Chesil Beach: A strained drama that loses it in the
last act
In Dominic Cooke’s directorial debut, he sticks closely to Ian McEwan’s original book, but it’s clear he’s more
comfortable with the theatre, with many aspects of the film resembling a stage play.
O
n Chesil Beach
has perhaps
the longest sex
scene I’ve ever
seen in my history of cin-
ema-going. We encounter
newly-weds Florence
(Saoirse Ronan) and
Edward (Billy Howle)
right at the beginning of
Dominic Cooke’s film,
and – shortly after sitting
through the post-wedding
dinner from hotel hell –
they start to get it on. Or,
at least they try. Things
don’t reach a climax
– both physically and
emotionally – until about
eighty minutes later, by
which time the film, and
the audience, has lost any
sense of excitement.
Interspersed between
this fumbling and tugging
and stalling is the story
of two lives, slowly but
surely coming together;
through flashbacks, we
follow Florence and
Edward as they make their
way towards each other
from radically different
backgrounds. Florence is
the upper-class daughter
of an academic (played
with haughty excellence
by Emily Watson, who
manages to deliver lines
like “I heard her on the
phone to Iris Murdoch” as
if it were the most natural
thing in the world) and a
factory-owner; she’s just
graduated from the Royal
College of Music, wants
to make it big with her
string quintet, and – for
the standards of the time
and milieu – is a bit of a
radical, attending CND
meetings in her spare
time.
It is at one of these
meetings that she meets
Edward, a bright man from
less well-off backgrounds,
who has just finished at
UCL (“But that’s London.
For sons of tradesmen,”
Florence’s mother cries).
His mother, played by
the brilliant Anne-Marie
Duff, is an artistic, eccen-
tric woman, whose life is
upended when she’s hit
by a moving train door,
leaving her ‘brain-dam-
aged’. It’s a moment of
shocking violence that has
repercussions throughout
the film, although Cooke
doesn’t go far enough in
exploring the impact it’s
had on Edward.
“The
screenplay
creates a
three-part
structure
out of a film
that can only
sustain a
single act”
The two meet, fall in
love, get married, and
then… an inability for
Florence to have sex
drives a wedge between
them, leading to a shouting
match on the shingles of
Chesil Beach. The reasons
behind this refusal, which
Edward terms frigidity,
are hinted at throughout
the film, although in the
process it seems to insist
the behaviour necessitates
an explanation, and that
this explanation must be
traumatic.
The film sticks closely
to the original book, with
Ian McEwan even serving
as the film’s screenwriter.
It’s understandable, but
a pity, since it creates a
three-part structure out of
a film that realistically can
only sustain a single act.
Whilethefilmhasanatural
cut-off point, leaving the
couple alone and isolated
on the beachfront, it
instead follows them up
through the decades, as
Edward and Florence
lose their youthful joie
de vivre, and gain heavy
ageing prosthetics. The
result is a film which falls
apart in the last half-hour,
undermining the careful
sense of time and place
created at the beginning
of the film. It also serves
to dampen down the
emotional poignancy
generated in the beach
scenes, instead replacing
it with something much
more close-ended and
hackneyed.
The cast give it their
all, however. Ronan is,
as usual, excellent in the
film, perfectly capturing
the mid-century British
accent of the upper crust,
all clipped vowels and
restraint. Her Florence
is hesitant and unsure of
herself, particularly in the
excruciating sex scene,
which reportedly took a
week to film, but Ronan
is able to turn on a dime,
switching from emotional
vulnerability to hard steel.
It’s difficult, however,
when comparing it to
her last performance, in
Greta Gerwig’s majestic
Lady Bird, to not miss
the impressive naturalism
of the film’s screenplay;
On Chesil Beach, in
comparison, seems stilted
and disjointed. Howle
manages to hold his own
against Ronan, although
he on occasion oversells
the blustery, impulsive
nature of his character.
Cooke’s main experi-
ence is in directing for the
stage, and it shows here:
the action is frequently
stilted, with numerous
section appearing more
like a televised play than
an actual film. While
cinematographer Sean
Bobbitt, who is best
known for his work with
Steve McQueen, manages
to capture the majestic
beauty of the English
landscape, things all too
often veer away from
naturalism and into a
more formalist style of
film-making.
It seems apropos that,
from a book all about
frustrated desires and
containment, we get a film
that is itself frustrating
and contained. On Chesil
Beach seems to waste its
brilliant cast on a drama
that is lacking in emotion-
al power, and weighted
down by a turgid ending;
while there are moments
where it manages to hit
the mark, they’re few and
far between in the over-
long film.
