WTF is Futsal? Felix sport’s guide to little known high-
In early February 2018 Sports Editor Imraj Singh went to try out Futsal with Imperial’s own squad.

F
utsal is a bit of
a rogue sport:
one of the rare
beauties with a
cult following. Relatively
unknown in the UK, it
has larger audiences in
Argentina, Brazil, Spain,
and Portugal – countries
which have spawned
some of the best football
players in the world. That
is no coincidence. The
likes of Pelé, Neymar,
Ronaldinho, Messi,
Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi,
ences. For a start the ball
is different: it’s smaller,
with a size 4 ball used as
opposed to the size 5 used
in football. Additionally,
a Futsal ball has about
30% less bounce than
its counterpart, and is
also heavier. This means
that it’s both harder to
kick and to control, and
players must exhibit more
skill. In addition, teams
are five a side, the pitches
and goals are smaller, the
playing surface is solid –
a basketball court rather
than a football field – and
the rules are designed
to speed up game play.
Like a condensed version
of football, where things
happen faster, with
futsal you are constantly
moving, and must shift,
flow, and ebb with your
teammates synchronously
and at high speed. At least
that was my experience…
For a heavy-footed,
under-exercised Sports
Editor the prospect
of Futsal was rather
daunting. I knew I would
be bad, it was just a matter
of how bad. I played
football through primary
school, and, with coaching
from my brother, even
managed to score a hat-
trick whilst playing for
our school’s third team.
“The likes of
Pele, Neymar,
Ronaldinho,

“You are
constantly

flow, and ebb

teammates
synchronously
and at high
speed”
These experiences left me
ill prepared for my time
with Imperial futsal. The
captain kindly allowed
me to give the sport a go,
despite the fact one of
their most hotly anticipat-
ed games was just around
the corner. IC futsal were
top-of-their-league and in
contention for promotion;
their players were at the
height of their season,
playing better than ever.
If there was ever a time
to be publicly humiliated
this was it. Sheepishly
moving through Ethos
at the heels of my Aero
husband (Harry Lanz, the
most uncoordinated man
alive, who has played
Futsal throughout his time
at Imperial), I joined the
squad in the changing
rooms. Quickly my
nerves relaxed. The casual
chat, friendly faces, and
welcoming demeanour of
all the bois was lovely,
Actually that’s a bit wet:
it was just normal. Just
the bois looking forward
to kicking a ball about
for the next two hours.
I began to realize I was
unnecessarily stressing.
Around 25 people
came along to the training
session, which was held
in the Ethos sports hall
– about average for the
team. Prior to warm-up
we took some shots at goal
and I entered a circle of
folk playing a keepy-upie
game. Naturally I was
the liability and allowed
the ball to touch the floor
whenever it was given to
me bar once... The few
‘fans’ looked down from
Ethos’ gym in disappoint-
ment. I was ready.
After warm-up, the
team would normally go
into a skill-based training,
shooting, passing, and
ball control drills, but
this time it was decided
that we would all split off
into teams and go straight
into games. Terrified, I
was handed a yellow bib
and Harry was put in the
unfortunate situation of
being my teammate. Prior
to the game, all players
were given a demon-
stration of some tactics.
As there are only four
outfield players (and one
goalkeeper) these are dif-
ferent from football, with
the team loosely divided
into two offensive and
two defensive players.
I say “loosely”: after
watching other teams play
I noticed the fluidity of the
game, a side-effect of the
small pitch. The ability to
have very fast counterat-
tacks means that there is
constant running for the
duration of the five-minute
games we played. Players
had to be very well-round-
ed; defenders were found
shooting, and offensive
player defended. When
I did play I found I fully
appreciated the pace of
the game. It’s the sort of
blink-and-you’ll-miss-it
of attack, counter-attack,
AND hat-trick speed of
play. But those who play
aren’t super human. I was
given advice by my peers
throughout the matches.
I felt I was getting better
from game to game. I can
imagine if I had started
playing at the start of the
year I may be mediocre,
instead of just terrible!
I spoke to our Futsal
correspondent (Harry

and Ronaldo all have
their roots entwined with
futsal. Ex-Barcelona
star Xavi has said: “In
futsal, you see whether a
player is really talented.
In normal football you
don’t necessarily identify
talent as easily because
it’s so much more phys-
ical. But with futsal, you
notice the small details in
quality, class, and tactical
understanding.” Futsal
separates the wheat from
the chaff.

Lanz), for his insight:
“I’ve played 11-a-side
football throughout my
life, and when I started at
Imperial I was immedi-
ately interested in trying
out for the team. Football
trials were fun but they
were very far away and
would end up taking
over four hours out of
my day. Due to conven-
ience, I turned towards
futsal – taking place in
ethos for two hours once
a week with matches most
Sundays – it was a lot less
time consuming but still
got me my football fix.”
“I had played futsal a
few times at school, but
it still took a while to get
used to the strange rules
compared to football.
However, once I got
used to them I found the
game to be a lot faster
and more volatile than
regular football. Futsal
also lends itself to the
technical side of football,
frequently rewarding
well executed skills with
gained ground and goals.
With no strict positions a
good futsal player must
be able to adapt on the fly
be the difference between
a goal or a turnover or a
successful counter attack
versus a conceded goal.
You have to think on your
feet and be ready to play
with a hugely variable
team with substitutions
happening every four or
so minutes.”
“The team has devel-
oped quite a bit since I first
joined, coming dead last
in the league in my first
year, albeit with a team of
mostly freshers, to placing
2nd
in the league this year;
narrowly missing out on
the top spot in a critical
playoff match. I look
forward to even more
progression as a team and
hopefully more success.”
“As a subset of the
football club we’re (a
small part) of the social
events that they hold and
are usually there with our
futsal ties. Our captain
Alex always does his best
in Bola Bola and I’m sure
he’ll gladly accept any
pint race challenges if you
find him at sports night.”
Futsal is a condensed
and concentrated form of
football, where all aspects
of football are developed
and more. Each game
is pretty much twenty
minutes of sprinting
which helps to trim the
waistline, and since it is
played indoors you avoid
chilly weekday training
evenings on the perma-
frost at fort Harlington.
With one game and one
training session (and
one sports night) a week
it is hardly a time sink
too. Finally, after this
year’s success there will
be a 2s team forming,
and the club is looking
to expand! No prior
experience is needed! So
