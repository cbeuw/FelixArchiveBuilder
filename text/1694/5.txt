f there is one group
of birds you have
probably noticed
declining in the
British countryside
over the past few years,
it is the songbirds.
Songbirds are a large
group of birds, which,
as their name suggests,
like to sing, filling the
landscapes they inhabit
with the beautiful sound
of bird songs. There is
a number of reasons for
their decline in recent
times, such as the loss
of habitats and the use of
pesticides, which has re-
duced the amount of prey
available in an area. One
factor which you may
not be aware of, however,
is that of hunting. Every
spring and autumn on the
islands of Malta there is a
hunt, in which thousands
of migrating birds are shot
over the Mediterranean
islands. This is not the
only place where song-
birds are at risk: a large
number of species have
disappeared from the wild
in south-east Asia, where
birds have been collected
to supply the pet trade.
Between spring and
autumn, thousands of
birds migrate between
Europe and their winter-
ing grounds in Africa.
The Maltese Islands are a
vital point in each bird’s
journey, acting as a stop-
over point, where they can
gather food and water; as
well as the chance to rest,
before or after facing the
seemingly impossible task
of crossing the Sahara
Desert. Malta opens a
hunting season targeting
birds en route to (or from)
their breeding grounds, at
a time when they are most
vulnerable. Among the
birds that are targeted are
species rapidly disappear-
ing in the UK – such as
the Turtle Dove – but also
birds of prey such as the
Marsh Harrier. Despite the
fact that rare species are
protected in the Maltese
Islands, many are illegally
shot each year during the
hunting seasons.
Recently, Springwatch
presenter and avid nat-
uralist Chris Packham
was detained by police
for trying to learn more
about the hunts whilst
filming a documentary on
the subject. After an alter-
cation whilst filming an
interview, Packham was
detained for more than
three hours at a police
station, before being later
charged. Despite the fact
that the aggressors in the
scenario were breaking
the law by keeping caged
birds, the police sided
with them. This obviously
highlights a significant
underlying issue, one
that will be a tough to
deal with, as this requires
changing the behaviour
and lifestyles of not only
the hunters, but also the
local police to ensure
wildlife protection laws
are enforced properly. The
only way to help prevent
this in the future is to
put our foot down and
let the Maltese gov-
ernment know that it is
unacceptable to carry on
like this, both as a nation
and as an international
community.

Getting down with the kids
W
ho doesn’t
love choco-
late? While
you and
I might enjoy its taste
freely, there are 80,000
children each year who
are unable to do so. The
reason: they suffer from
type 1 diabetes, which
manifests itself at an early
age. Unlike type 2 dia-
betes, which comes into
effect at an old age, due to
the pancreas slowly losing
its ability to produce
enough insulin, type 1 di-
abetes has genetic origins
leaving patients needing
to constantly monitoring
their food habits from
childhood.
The presence of
diabetes within an indi-
vidual can be attributed
to a combination of both
nature and nurture.
However, the genetic
causes (nature) far trumps
personal habits (nurture)
as the leading cause of
type 1 diabetes. This
makes the dangers of type
1 diabetes particularly
difficult: since its onset
occurs in childhood, there
can be a high risk of a
reduction in life expectan-
cy; and since the pancreas
malfunctions, and is
unable to make insulin,
there is far less tolerance
for hyperglycaemic
attacks compared to type
2 patients.
Due to its high inci-
dence and mortality risk,
it is important to have an
early diagnosis, ensuring
correct interventions
are provided in a timely
fashion. The presence of a
family history of diabetes
is considered a “red
flag,” and puts children at
higher risk of developing
the condition. However,
it is neither a perfect
indicator nor a necessary
condition for diabetes to
develop. Therefore, to
tackle this issue, scientists
from Helmholtz Zentrum
München developed a

“genetic score” to identify
if an infant possess the
risk of type 1 diabetes
with no family history of
the condition. The study
was conducted over ten
years, with more than
3000 children monitored
since their infancy, that
were followed up every
three to six months.
The researchers used
genetic information from
multiple sequences of
DNA associated with
diabetes risks to create a
more reliable metric to
predict the risk of devel-
oping the condition. By
using this score, it will be
possible to sort infants for
early-stage interventions,
which could enhance both
the quality of life and
life expectancy of these
children. The scientists
are confident in the re-
al-world applicability of
their research and have
filed a patent based on this
genetic score.
The life of a diabetic
patient can be a difficult
one, with the slightest
negligence having the
potential to turn into a
life-threatening accident.
The lack of a direct causal
understanding of the
origin of type 1 diabetes
makes the matter even
trickier. Hopefully, using
this advanced genetic
scoring, further improve-
ments along this line can
forge the way for individ-
ualised medicine – where
patients can be treated
according to their specific
needs based on their
unique genetic footprint.
Type I Diabetes can be a life-threatening condition that strikes the young. New scientific developments suggest
we might be able to look to genetics to see who is most at risk.
