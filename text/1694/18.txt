Day One
O
n the first day,
we visited the
beaches, start-
ing from Santa
Monica. It’s a separate
city with lively streets,
full of shops and diners to
choose from. The beach
is enormously wide and
separated from the streets
by tall cliffs. The Santa
Monica pier offers a
breath-taking view of the
Pacific Ocean and is the
end point of Route 66, the
famous road going all the
way from Chicago across
eight states. We also took
a bus to Malibu, but the
beach there wasn’t as nice
as we’d hoped – not really
suitable for swimming and
mostly used by surfers.
Back in Santa Monica,
we managed to catch a
fiery sunset behind the
cliffs, and then walked
along the ocean to Venice
Beach, where we visited
canals similar to the ones
in Venice, Italy. Unfortu-
nately, it was already dark,
so we couldn’t appreciate
the area in all its beauty,
and it felt a bit dodgy.
Also, despite the weather
being very hot in LA, it
was at least 10o
C colder at
the beach, and got really
chilly in the evening. So
my advice is to arrive at
the beaches earlier to see
everything before sunset.
Day Two
We began this day by
hiking to the Hollywood
Sign. We started from
the Griffith Observatory
and took a path which
was meant to lead us to
the sign in around 90
minutes. On our way, we
noticed signs warning
hikers about rattlesnakes.
Being mesmerised by the
views of LA around us,
we somehow managed to
take the wrong turn which
steered us away from the
main path. We realised
that a bit too late so the
only option was hiking
up and down every hill
on the way to the sign,
using narrow mountain
paths, and holding onto
stones in the ground to
avoid falling over. There
were no tourists – just a
couple of fit locals who
clearly used this route for
training. Only then did we
realised what we’d got
ourselves into – but it was
well worth it when we
finally reached the sign!
The highest spot is just
above the letters, guarded
by a tall fence – don’t even
think about climbing over
and sitting on them as it
will result in a fine and
possibly imprisonment!
We opted for finishing
our difficult hike with
yet another challenge –
climbing the last hill to
reach the Wisdom Tree,
where you can enjoy the
panorama of LA for the
last time and appreciate
the greatness of the city.
You have the Hollywood
Hills around you with
Lake Hollywood and the
cityscape at the bottom
– a perfect interplay
between natural and urban
environments. Overall,
our unexpected detour
took us around three and
a half hours (all in 35o
C)
– the struggle was real,
but this was one of the
most amazing things I’ve
done in my life. Finally,
we finished the day by
heading to Hollywood
Boulevard to see the Walk
of Fame.
Day Three
Day three was spent
at the Universal Studios
Hollywood theme park.
The ticket includes
not only rides and live
shows but also a tour of
movie sets. You can also
purchase a pint of butter-
beer or Marge-Simpson-
style cotton candy. After
exiting the Studios, don’t
leave just yet – a nearby
place called Universal
CityWalk is buzzing with
Los Angeles, I’m yours: five days in Pacific paradise

Los Angeles, or the City of Angels, is one of the largest and most famous cities in the world, but tourists can
struggle to find things to do there. Travel Editor Edita Pileckyte spent five days there last September – here are
some interesting places and activities for the full LA experience!

shops, cafes, cinemas,
and street performances,
making it a perfect way to
end the day.
Day Four
The day started with
the trip to Beverly Hills,
where we walked along
the main street, Rodeo
Drive, lined with designer
shops, and visited the
Beverly Wilshire hotel
featured in Pretty Woman.
Besides that, you can
take a guided tour of
celebrity homes but it’s
quite pricey. However, we
spent the rest of our day
on Hollywood Boulevard
again since we had won
tickets to the filming of the
Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
Many famous talk shows
give away free tickets,
you just need to enter a
competition a few days in
advance – this will give
you a taste of how such
shows work behind the
screen, and will definitely
be a memorable part of
your LA visit.
Day Five
Our last day was spent
in Downtown LA, with
“You have the
Hollywood
Hills around
you with Lake
Hollywood and
the cityscape
at the bottom
– a perfect
interplay
between
natural
and urban
environments”
majestic skyscrapers and
the beautifully-designed
Walt Disney Concert Hall.
We also visited City Hall,
a high security institution
offering panoramic views
of the surrounding area
(doesn’t top the Holly-
wood Hills though!),
and Little Tokyo, home
to Japanese shops,
museums, and gardens.
Finally, before departing
to our next destination, we
explored the area around
the bus station, where LA
was founded in 1781.
Last points
Even in mid-Septem-
ber, the weather is very hot
(~35o
C) so make sure to
bring something to cover
your head, and plenty of
water. Also, whilst LA is
infamous for trafic, we
didn’t have any problems
with using public trans-
port – going places took
time because it’s a huge
city but it wasn’t nearly
as bad as we expected.
Finally, if you have even
more time and run out of
things to do, you can drive
to San Diego, a city south
of LA, or visit Disneyland
in Anaheim.
