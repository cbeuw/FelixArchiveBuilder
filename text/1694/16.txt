Preconceived notions: reviews and sales
How the anchoring effect changes the way we look at games and makes us spend extravagantly.
W
e may not
realise it,
but our
opinions of
certain games, films, and
TV shows are usually
formed, even before we
get to experience them
ourselves. This is due
to all the reviews we
see, hear, or read about
before or straight after
a product’s release. Our
brains are more likely to
think something is good if
we’re told that it is good
beforehand. This is some-
thing that’s been called
the anchoring effect.
In a study done after
the release of Plants vs.
Zombies, different groups
of people were told that
the game was either
reviewed well or poorly
by critics. After playing
the game themselves, the
volunteers who were told
it got good reviews gave
it a higher score than
those who were told it got
“We want to
make sure
we get our
money’s
worth”
“It’s not a good
deal to buy a
game on sale
if you’re not
going to play
it ”
they hear so many good
things about.
game is worth buying and
playing.
With the reviews, we
already form a notion of
what the game is going
to be like and use it to
shape our actions forward.
However, this behaviour
doesn’t just apply to
reviews but also to things
like Steam sales and game
bundle deals. If a game is
on sale for a price between
£40-60, we’re only likely
to buy it if we’re massive
fans of the series or if we
know for sure that this is a
game we’re going to play
and don’t want to wait for.
However, if a £50 game
was on sale for £10, a lot
of people would see this
as a good deal and buy the
game, even if they might
not have had a very strong
interest in it beforehand.
The original price forms
a preconceived notion of
the game’s value in our
heads. So when we see the
reduced price and state-
ments such as “75% off!”,
we rationalise buying the
game as us making good
on a deal, on a price that
was already formed in our
head.
But was buying the
reduced price game
really a good deal? A lot
of games we buy from
Steam sales usually just
lie around in our games
library. In the same way
that it’s not a good deal to
buy a fully priced game
and not play it, it’s not a
good deal to buy a game
on sale if you’re not going
to play it or experience it
yourself. It’s like buying
a movie ticket but never
going to see the movie.
It’s a trap so many of us
fall into time and time
again.
Game developers
use these preconceived
notions to their advantage.
Just like how they’re stra-
tegic about which review-
ers they let play the game
first hand, they’re also
usually strategic about
how they price the game.
Sometimes they price a
game or its bundles and
DLC higher than it should
be, so more people buy it
during a sale. They also
make a point of showing
how much you save by
buying different or larger
bundles of the game;
that’s them setting a pre-
conceived notion in your
head for how things are.
This phenomenon is
everywhere, it affects
your gaming experience,
it may drain your wallet
and it helps form review
scores. Knowing it exists
might not be enough for
you to be immune to it,
but if you keep your eye
open, you just might be
able to spot it in action.

A good review makes all the difference // Mr Seb
negative reviews.
According to the an-
choring effect, we base
all our opinions on the
first piece of data we hear
about something. If we
play a critically acclaimed
game, we’re more likely
to ignore its flaws and
glitches and focus on its
more positive aspects.
Consequently, we’re more
likely to recommend it
to friends or write good
reviews about it. The
same is true in the exact
reverse, if we play a crit-
ically panned game, every
fault and error serves to
add to our view of it as a
‘bad’ game.
This is why game devel-
opers are selective about
who they get to review the
game before release. They
try to make sure that their
game gets played by the
more ‘friendly’ reviewers
of the community so that
early opinions will be
more favourable. This
causes a ripple effect
where the later reviewers
will also be favourable
and positive, and, by ex-
tension, more people will
end up buying the game
Sometimes it might
not always be like this. A
really critical review of
a game from a long-run-
ning franchise may be
dismissed by its fans as
being biased or unfair.
For the most part though,
reviews do have a role to
play to how we go about
deciding which game to
play or buy. And it makes
sense. Games aren’t
exactly the cheapest form
of entertainment there
is, so we want to make
sure we get our money’s
worth. What’s the point
in investing in a product
that we know is going
to disappoint us? So we
read reviews to find out
for ourselves whether a
