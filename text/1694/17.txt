Breaking: R. Kelly is still a revolting human being
MUSIC

T
his article is
sensitive, and
discusses ex-
treme violence
against women. Reader
discretion is advised.
R. Kelly is back in the
news – as in, he’s being
sued for sexual slavery.
His conduct is deeply
immoral – sick and
hideous behavior. And
it’s been going on for 20
fucking years.
Those familiar with
R. Kelly’s fantastic lack
of care for fellow human
beings may recall his
monstrous treatment of
Aaliyah, then a rising teen
star. Her debut album,
produced by Kelly, was
titled Age Ain’t Nothing
But a Number. They met
when she was 12; her
debut album was released
at 14; they were illegally
married when she was 15.
The marriage was in 1994.
Knowledge of this
marriage was widespread
in the music industry.
Kelly’s been quoted – “I
can tell you I loved her, I
can tell you she loved me,
we was very close.” Other
than this, neither have
spoken about the marriage
publicly (besides her court
motions).
For the record, the
marriage was annulled
when Aaliyah’s family
found out in 1995. She
attempted to have the
records expunged in 1997
(these motions being the
smoking gun proving the
marriage happened). At
the time, another woman
was suing Kelly for having
sex with her when she was
15; he was 24. The case
was settled for $250,000.
Aaliyah tragically passed
in a plane crash in 2001.
She was 22.
That’s not all, folks. In
2002, a tape surfaced of R.
Kelly having sex with and
urinating on yet another
teenager. Police seized his
camera and found twelve
pornographic pictures of
underage women. He was
indicted on 21 counts of
child pornography; the
case was dismissed over a
technicality relating to the
search warrant – “lack of
probable cause.” The trial
related to the tape was
postponed over and over
again by R. Kelly’s legal
team, citing whatever
would push the date over
the horizon; eventually,
in 2008, a jury cleared R.
Kelly, The Human Delay
of Trial, of all counts.
And now, the new
allegations. Three sets
of parents have come
forward, alleging that R.
Kelly is holding women,
their childre, in a “sex
cult”. One has come
forward accusing him of
purposefully infecting her
with an incurable sexu-
ally-transmitted disease
and refers to her case as
“sexual enslavement.”
Horrid? Yes. Shocking?
No. The man’s 51 – this is
a well-established pattern
of behavior, whispered
in the media, and legible
on his fucking Wikipedia
page. These are Wein-
stein-esque patterns of
turning a blind eye to the
kinds of toxic behavior
that keep capable women
out of music. Thank
Christ for #MeToo – it’s
only too easy to imagine
this behavior continuing
into perpetuity. Hopefully
the winds of change will
blow R Kelley right into
prison – or wherever else
his miserable ass will get
some comeuppance.
From the Felix Music
staff, from deep within all
our hearts – R. Kelly: fuck
you!
R. Kelly has demonstrated a sick pattern of behaviour //

TELL ME HOW YOU
REALLY FEEL
O
n first listen,
Tell Me How
You Really Feel,
the long-antic-
ipated new album from
Australian slacker-rock
queen Courtney Barnett
couldn’t seem more differ-
ent from her breakthrough
Sometimes I Sit and
Think, and Sometimes I
Just Sit. ‘Hopefulessness’,
the opening track, is a
guitar-led dirge, with
Barnett’s flat vocals
peering out from behind
waves of distorted strum-
ming that reaches an apex
in the song’s conclusion.
It’s a sharp contrast from
her last album’s opener
– ‘Elevator Operator’, a
sparky, upbeat tune that
displayed all the usual
qualities we’ve come
to expect from Barnett:
smart, witty lyrics;
intricate guitar riffs; and a
knack for catchy melody.
With the next track,
‘City Looks Pretty’,
however, we’re back into
familiar Barnett territory,
as she sings-speaks about
day to day mundanities.
This classic formula is
repeated several times
duringthealbum,although
there is definitely a sense
that, with this album,
Barnett released all the
best tracks as singles,
meaning the remainder
of the songs simply don’t
measure up. The bouncy
rhythms of tracks like
‘City Looks Pretty’ and
‘Charity’ are intercut with
heavier tracks, such as
the down-tempo ‘Need a
Little Time’, in an album
that is more introspective.
The album in general
has a much darker, more
layered sound than her
previous work: the guitars
are scuzzier, the riffs
meatier, with a heightened
focus on melody over
lyrics. This marks an im-
portant development for
Barnett, but does seem to
detract from the qualities
that attracted so many
of us to her in the first
place: her wicked sense
of wordplay, and ability to
craft a slick lyric.
To be sure, there are
some classic lines to
be found on the album:
Barnett is particularly
adept at ironic juxtapo-
sition (“Meditation just
makes you more upset”
on ‘Charity’) or canny
metaphors (indecision
“rots like a bag of last
week’s meat” on the
punchy ‘Crippling Self
Doubt and a General Lack
of Confidence’). And,
despite a general sense
of vulnerability on the
album, she’s not afraid
to deliver a kiss-off line,
like “He said ‘I could eat
a bowl of alphabet soup/
and spit out better words
than you’/but you didn’t”
on the incredibly boppy
‘Nameless Faceless’.
‘I’m Not Your Mother,
I’m Not Your Bitch’,
which marks the mid-
point of the album, is a
significant sonic departure
for Barnett, her trademark
drawl replaced with some-
thing more akin to a sneer.
It also marks a turning
point for the album,
which is front-loaded with
catchy tunes. From the
mid-point onwards, the
tracks become increas-
ingly forgettable, closing
out with a bizarre fade-out
on ‘Sunday Roast’, which
suddenly segues midway
through from a rambling
track to a sing-along
chorus. It’s a choice that
doesn’t quite work, but
still leaves us looking
forward to what Barnett
will bring next.
Yeah, but how do you really feel though? // Milk!
