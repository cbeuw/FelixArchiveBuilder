E
arlier this week
saw the launch
of the WOM-
ENinSTEM@
IC group, which aims
to address the gender
imbalance in STEM.
The group, part of the
Women’s Engineering
Society (WES), held
their launch event on the
evening of Monday 21st
May, attracting many
young scientists with an
impressive line-up of
panellists.
Speakers included
Professor Dame Julia
Higgins, President of the
Institute of Physics, Dr
Ozak Esu, electrical engi-
neer and one of the Tele-
graph’s ‘Top 50 Women
in Engineering under
35’, and Professor Joanna
Haigh, Co-Director of the
D
r Dzulkefly
Ahmad has
been sworn
in as the new
Health Minister for
Malaysia under Tun Dr
Mahathir bin Moham-
ad’s new government.
Dr Dzulkefly – who
completed his doctorate
in toxicology at Imperial
College London in the
early 1990s – is a member
of Parti Amanah Negara
Imperial alumnus new Malaysian Health Minister
(National Trust Party) a
centre-left party which
advocates political Islam.
He previously held
the position of Member
of Parliament from 2008
to 2013 for the town
of Kuala Sengor. The
politician is known for
his decision to support a
controversial ruling of the
Malaysian High Court al-
lowing a weekly Christian
publication called Herrald
to use the term “Allah”.
Dr Ahmad stated to
Malaysian Press: "To
me, I see this as an op-
portunity to bring all of
us closer together despite
our religious differences
and submit to the God
Almighty. We all believe
in God and we call God
Allah.”
He joins the newly
elected Tun Dr Ma-
hathir for his second
non-consecutive term,
following the ousting of
the then-ruling Barisan
Nasional party in the 2018
general elections, which
saw his former ally, Najib
Razak stepping down
from the position of Prime
Minister. Barisan Na-
tional and its predecessor
Alliance party have held
onto power for over half a
century, one of the longest
streaks for a political party
in modern history.
The loss of the gov-
ernment has been seen
as a direct consequence
of the 1Malaysia Devel-
opment Berhad (1MDB)
former Prime Minister is
also accused of involve-
ment in the murder of
Shaariibuu Altantuya in
2015, a Mongolian model
who was a mistress of a
close associate of Najib.
She was killed either by
gunshot or a subsequent
C-4 explosion. Two
ex-police officers were
sentenced to death for the
murder.
Felix spoke to Imperial
College Union Malaysian
Society, who said: “We
are proud of Dr Ahmad,
an Imperial alumnus who
has been appointed as the
new Health Minister of
Malaysia after the recent
historical election. We
would like to wish him
all the best in executing
his tasks and the best of
health!”

Chiara Heide, Imperial
PhD candidate and chair
of the group, told Felix:
“founding this group has
been a lot of work with
my team, but it is worth it
when you see how many
people turned up at the
launch and want to get
involved.” Heide said the
enthusiasm for the event,
which was held in the
City and Guilds Building,
showed “there is an actual
need of out WOMENin-
STEM@IC group”.
The committee of
five aim to “provide a
platform for personal and
professional growth”,
and “improve retention
of young women STEM
graduates.”
The event comes amid
increasing scrutiny of
gender equality in aca-
demia, with last month’s
release of gender pay gap
data showing the gap at
Russell Group universi-
ties is twice the national
average. A 2014 report
from the government’s
Science and Technology
Committee reported only
17% of STEM professors
were women; while en-
couraging young women
to choose STEM degrees
is worthwhile, data show
these students are often
‘lost’ post-graduation,
with higher attrition rates
than their male peers.
Professor Stephen
Curry, Imperial’s Assis-
tant Provost (Equality,
Diversity, and Inclusion),
offered his congratula-
tions to Heide and the
committee: “The expert
panel of successful
women academics, engi-
neers and entrepreneurs
spoke very candidly about
their experiences and
raised a lot of important
questions from the audi-
ence. It is my hope that
our reinvigorated work at
Imperial on equality, di-
versity and inclusion will
be able to provide some
long-overdue answers.”
Heide told Felix: “This
initiative wouldn’t have
been possible without
the work of all commit-
tee members and the
ongoing support of my
academic supervisor, Dr
Cleo Kontoravdi, and the
Department of Chemical
Engineering. Stay tuned
for more, and don’t let
anyone take away your
curiosity, your passion,
your determination, or
your dreams.”

London has one of
the highest propor-
tions of internation-
Imperial among most international unis in the world
al students of European
universities, according
to new data.
An analysis by Times
Higher Education found
Imperial was the seventh
most international uni-
versity in the world, with
55.4% of the student body
coming from overseas.
London was one of the
most popular cities for in-
ternational students, with
six universities within the
top 20 ranking; in total, 72
of the top 200 universities
for international student
numbers were within the
UK.
These results follow on
from Times Higher Ed-
ucation rankings earlier
this year, which ranked
Imperial as the best uni-
versity for international
students in the UK, based
on reputation, number of
students and staff, and in-
ternational collaboration.
Imperial has increas-
ingly been focussing
attention on developing
global links in recent
years. This February saw
the appointment of Profes-
sor Maggie Dallman OBE
as the College’s first Vice
President (International).
The College said the role
was linked to their strate-
gic aim of “strengthening
ties with global partners”.
Following her appoint-
ment, Professor Dallman
said the College had been
“purposeful in pursuing
international collabora-
tions, working to address
global challenges, and
recruiting talented staff
and students from around
the world.”
Data released by the
College has shown how
the make-up of new
student admissions has
changed over the past five
years: in 2011/12, 59% of
the nearly-6000 students
admitted were from over-
seas; by 2016/17 this has
increased to 66%, with the
number of admissions also
increasing by over a thou-
sand. The most common
country of origin for new
admissions is China,
followed by France, Italy,
and Germany.
The most international
university within the UK
was the London School of
Economics (LSE), with
70.5% of their students
coming from abroad. The
American University of
Sharjah, in the United
Arab Emirates, was the
most international univer-
sity globally, with over
four fifths of their students
being international.
solutions – at Imperial.
Professor Weber said
that he was “honoured”
by the appointment and
was looking forward to
creating new collabora-
tions during his time as
Dean. Imperial’s Provost,
Professor James Stir-
ling, said: “Our Faculty
of Medicine is at the
forefront of advancing
biomedical discoveries
and translating them
into the clinical setting.
In addition to being one
of our most prominent
researchers, Professor
Weber has a huge amount
of leadership experience
both at Imperial and with
our NHS trust partners.
I know he will drive the
faculty forward to new
advances and successes.”
A representative of Im-
perial College School of
Medicine Students' Union
(ICSMSU) told Felix:
"We were pleased to hear
the news of Professor
Weber being appointed
as the new Dean for the
Faculty of Medicine. We
are looking forward to de-
veloping a close working
relationship with him, to
better the student experi-
ence here at Imperial."
Professor Weber has
been at Imperial since
1991, when he was ap-
pointed Jefferiss Professor
of Communicable Dis-
eases and Genitourinary
Medicine, and established
a new HIV and STI aca-
demic department at the
college.
Professor Weber has
been at the forefront of
HIV and AIDS research
since 1982. Notably
developing combination
antiretroviral therapy –
the use of multiple drugs
to keep the effects of HIV
at bay – in the 1990s. He
now works on prevention
of infection through use of
vaccines, running the first
european HIV efficacy
trial in Uganda, South
Africa, Mozambique, and
Tanzania.
In 1987, he founded the
peer-reviewed research
paper “AIDS”, holding
the position of founding
editor until 1992, the year
when he co-founded the
WHO network for HIV
characterisation. Profes-
sor Weber is a member
a number of different
groups such as the Re-
search Advisory Group
for the Department for In-
ternational Development
(DfID) and the University
Partnership Board of the
Francis Crick Institute.
His career has been
heavily focused in the
fields of medicine and
education, following
training as a clinician, he
held different positions
from a fellowship in
Clinical Training at St
Mary’s Hospital Medical
School in the early 80s to
becoming a senior lectur-
er of Infectious Diseases
at the Royal Postgraduate
Medical School, Ham-
mersmith Hospital from
1988 to 1991.
