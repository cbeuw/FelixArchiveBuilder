Artists at Work – the original selfies
A
rtists at Work,
the title of
the small
collection of
drawings currently on
display at the Courtauld
Gallery, is appropriate
in more ways than one.
While curators Deanna
Petterbridge and Anita
Viola Sganzerla undoubt-
edly chose the name to
reflect the content of
the drawings – artists
leaning close into their
easels to better capture
their subjects; cluttered
ateliers devoid of people;
allegorical self-portraits
of artists plying their trade
– the artists collected are
far more often working
on something more im-
portant than the canvas or
oils: their self-image.
Those visiting the
exhibition in the hope of
technical details on how
exactly artists created
their works will be left
slightly disappointed.
Those entering the
Gilbert and Ildiko Butler
Drawings Gallery with no
preconceptions, however,
will get an insight into
the psyche of the artists
themselves.
A number of works are
classically allegorical,
such as David Kandel’s
Renaissance drawing of
a representation of virtue
shielding the hard-work-
ing artist from the rains
of professional envy. Jean
Honoré Fragonard’s chalk
and ink image showing
an artist, head bent in
creative crisis, as ideas
and fantasies swirl around
him, is similarly po-faced,
and teeters on the edge of
ironic camp.
emotions, which belie the
inner state of the artists,
who has been forced to
flee his home country in
the advent of war.
A similar conflict
between beauty and terror
can be seen in the Egon
Schiele work on display; a
rare still-life, it depicts the
bleached interior of the
POW camps in Mühling,
where Schiele was con-
scripted in WWI. While
there are none of Schiele’s
tortuous, fleshy bodies
on display, the absence
of people manages to
make the image all the
more startling, with the
unsettling lines instantly
recognisable as his. The
drawing highlights the
brutal tension at play;
his studio doubled as his
office, becoming simulta-
neously a source of artistic
expression and part of the
vast machinations of war.
The exhibition is at its
best when invoking this
kind of austere naturalism,
which still manages to
contain emotional charge.
Many of the drawings
lack this, instead favour-
ing a constructed, care-
fully-curated reality: an
artist dwarfed by a giant
statue of Jupiter in a set of
non-existent Roman ruins;
a deer leaping across the
painter as he works en
plein air, both amazing
and shocking him; an
empty studio where
clutter still manages to be
artfully arranged. If the
exhibition shows anything
about how artists work, it
shows they sure can be
controlling.
The stand out drawing
in the collection more
than makes up for some
of this treacly fair: Horst
Tamsen’s 1972 drawing of
the atelier of the sculptor
Reno Rossi, in Locarno,
shows a squalid, rotting
studio, less sky-lit than
sky-assaulted, with a thin
beam all that seems to
be keeping the decaying
Romantic Europe.
Sculptures are picked out
against the gloom and the
collapsing ceiling: a large
figure in rusty-red on one
side; a glowering bust de-
scribed in glowing pastels
above a dark beam; and, at
the centre, a ghostly blue
apparition draws the eye.
It’s unclear what exactly is
leaking out from the murk
to meet us – the artist, or
his work?
And so, while Artists
at Work may tell us some-
thing about how artists do
indeed work – drawing
implements abound, with
mahl sticks aplenty – it
shows us much more
about how they think,
both about themselves
and the world.
This new display of drawings at the Courtauld Gallery highlights some technical aspects of how artists work, but
reveals much more about how artists really view themselves.

ARTISTS AT WORK
“Those visiting

Luckily, the works are
balanced out by a number
that show the skewer this
sense of artistic preten-
sion: the Dutch genre
painter Cornelis Dusart
contributes a drawing of
an elderly artist, sitting
at an easel, and peering
at the world around him
through bottle-thick
spectacles, undermining
the idea of the artist as
unfiltered observer of the
world. George Grosz’s
self-portrait-cum-carica-
ture similarly subverts the
notion of the artist at work,
balancing on the knife-
edge of the grotesque:
sitting at his desk, Grosz
seems oblivious to the
destructive nature around
him, as an eagle clutches
at a rat and beetles majes-
tically scuttle across his
drawing tools. The 1940
drawing evokes confusing
