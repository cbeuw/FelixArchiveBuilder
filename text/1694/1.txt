permitted by law.

ages of
I m p e r i a l
employees
are de-
creasing in real terms
despite many staff work-
ing longer each week
than is permitted by
government regulations.
College spending on
staff as a proportion of
totalexpenditurehasfallen
from 55.2% in 2011/12 to
52.8% in 2016/17. Pay
at Imperial has failed to
match inflation (currently
2.3%), leading to an
average salary decrease
in real terms of 1.1% each
year since 2005. These
figures – published in a
pay claim by trade unions
Unite, Unison, and the
University and College
Union (UCU) – do not
take into account addi-
tional costs associated
with living in London.
Data from the National
Institute of Economic and
Social Research suggests
London living costs have
risen twice as quickly as
pay at Imperial.
A College spokesper-
son said: “We are com-
mitted to offering staff a
pay and benefits package
that is equitable, fair and
appropriately reflects the
College’s standing as a
world leading university.”
The pay claim will be
discussed on Friday 25th
May, and “the College’s
response will be shared
with staff in the coming
weeks”.
A statement from Im-
perial College Union said:
“'Imperial College Union
has re-emphasised the
importance of fairly re-
warding academics in pro-
viding our members with
a world-class experience.
Our students do not want
to be taught and supported
by demotivated staff.
“We hope that the
College uses the pay
and benefits review to
engage our community
in a discussion about how
Imperial spends its money
and to acknowledge the
hard work of our staff
across the institution,” it
continued.
The unions have called
for a salary rise 7.5%
or £3,000, whichever
is highest, to cover the
gap between salaries and
London living costs, and
“as an installment towards
the massive shortfall in
Imperial College pay
settlements over the past
12 years”. The unions also
want this to be applied to
staff who are paid by the
hour and say the College
should commit to paying
at least the London Living
Wage (currently £10.20
per hour) at all times.
Although staff have
seen their wages fall in
real terms, the College’s
total salary bill for 2016-
2017 increased by 3.2%
from the previous year.
In the same time period,
the payment settlement
for most staff was 1.1%.
The unions’ pay claim
asserts this is due to an
“exceptional increase in
very highly paid staff”.
The unions state the
salary increase for the 111
employees earning more
