Ramadan: What is it? What does it mean? And how do
you balance it with exams?
Last week saw the start of the month of Ramadan, during which time Muslims focus on inner reflection and
spirituality. Students give their thoughts on what Ramadan means to them, and how to fast during the summer.

or most people
on campus, last
Thursday was
largely unre-
markable – aside from
the weather deciding to
behave itself.
But for some students,
and for 1.8 billion
Muslims worldwide,
Thursday 17th
May
marked the start of the
month of Ramadan. For
the uninitiated, Ramadan
is one of the biggest
events in the Islamic
calendar, as Muslims
fast daily from dawn till
sunset. Whilst fasting is
commonly perceived as
simply giving up food
and drink, it extends far
further – Muslims are en-
couraged to abstain from
bad thoughts and actions,
and instead focus on inner
reflection and spirituality.
Above all else, the
Ramadan experience is
unique to every believer.
Below, we’ve collected
some insights and tips
from Muslims across
campus on what Ramadan
means to them and how
they balance fasting with
student life.
What is Ramadan?
Whilst avoiding food
and drink between sunrise
and sunset is partly to
empathise with the poor
the main purpose of the
month is about spiritual-
ity: becoming closer to
God, giving up bad habits
for the entire month,
and more. Ramadan is
a time filled with big
get-togethers and family
reunions. Repairing old
relationships and forming
new ones all for the
blessings of Allah. This
is a blessed month of re-
flection aimed at strength-
ening the bond between
creator and creation.
Ramadan teaches you
about self-discipline and
feeding your soul rather
than feeding your desires.
After all, we are spiritual
beings in a physical body
which will ultimately be
left behind. On that note:
Happy Ramadan! And
yes, not even water!

Advice for students
fasting
With the auspicious
month of Ramadan co-
inciding with exams or
projects, this month is a
time of managing multiple
goals and multitasking.
Below are some tips to
maximise spiritual and
academic benefit.
1. Get into a routine.
Revision benefits from
consistency. Setting, and
maintaining, a regular
routine will benefit your
work and your body.
You can choose to either
drastically change your
routine or attempt to keep
it as normal as possible.
Just bear in mind what
time your exams are.
like the last few hours of
the fast, for simpler tasks.
3. Timetable in
your Islamic goals with
as much importance as
academic studies. Setting
goals is important, but
slotting in the time to
achieve them is essential.
There are many things
we can do in order to
make the month pass with
more ease, although it’s
worth remembering that
Ramadan isn’t meant to
be a month of comfort.
Remember every action in
can be a form of worship
with the correct intention
– even revising!

Ramadan@Imperial
As Ramadan coincides
with exam season, many
students will be in a state
of stress and anxiety, with
the feeling of being short
on time. The Ramadan@
Imperial programme
prevents any student
making the tough choice
between their religion and

studies, facilitating a con-
venient on-campus oppor-
tunity to break their fast
with fellow colleagues,
without them having to
spend time out of the
library to prepare a meal.
Nightly prayers are also
held, allowing students
to stay in spirited faith
during the holy month,
without them having to
travel to local mosques.
It generates a sense of
community with average
total attendees reaching
60+, while also providing
downtime to unwind,
which is crucial during
this stressful period. With
many students associat-
ing Ramadan as being
with family, Ramadan@
Imperial has truly become
a #HomeAwayFrom-
Home.

Personal experience
of Ramadan
Whilst observing the
month of Ramadan is
prescribed by God and is
an integral aspect of being
a Muslim, every Muslim
has their own personal
experience of Ramadan.
“Ramadan
teaches you
about feeding
your soul
rather than
feeding your
desires”
2. Notice when you
feel most productive. This
is usually after eating
before dawn or at sunset.
Capitalise on these times
and use them to do tasks
that require the most
attention, such as essay
practise or problem ques-
tions. Use other times,
“While
Ramadan is an
integral part of
being Muslim,
everyone has
their own
experience”
For me Ramadan
means, of course, gaining
closeness to God, and
reminding myself of my
love of my religion. It
also means time spent
with family and friends,
working on any bad habits
of mine and gaining new,
better ones. The month
is spent both within the
community – such as
breaking the fast with
ISoc at Ramadan@
Imperial – and also in
solitude, admitting any
faults I have within myself
and rectifying them. It’s a
month of relative hardship
when compared to the
other eleven months in
the calendar. Despite this
I look forward to each
Ramadan and whilst Eid
(the celebration to mark
the end of the month) is
celebrated there is always
a bittersweet feeling left
behind.
