Imperial deletes all student data as GDPR comes into
force

have finally admitted
they have no idea
what’s going to
happen when GDPR
comes into effect, and
have destroyed all
data on campus.

I
mperial College
London have de-
cided to destroy all
their data, in light
of new data protection
regulations coming into
force today.
The General Data
Protection Regulation
(GDPR), a new set of
regulations designed to
protect the data privacy
of EU citizens, has led to
a mass panic at all levels
of the College, as staff
members try to under-
stand what the regulations
are, and how they’ll affect
their work practices.
In a shocking turn of
events, a few hours before
the regulations came
into force, the College
announced they were
planning on destroying
all information in their
possession, going right
back to the early 19th
century. Owen Rathbone,
the hastily-appointed Vice
Provost (Do You Still
Want To Hear From Us?),
told Hangman the move
was the right action to
take: “we were erring on
the side of caution, but it
got to Thursday morning,
less than 24 hours before
the regulations came into
effect, and we realised we
still don’t really have any
idea of what the fuck any
of the new rules mean for
us. Instead of running the
risk of being hit with the
new fines, we just decided
to delete all data we hold.”
While the new reg-
ulations mainly cover
personal data, the College
decided to enact ‘Project
Scorched Earth’, delet-
ing all email addresses,
student and staff registry
data, and financial in-
formation. The College
say they will now “begin
again from scratch,
creating a new institution
in the mold of these regu-
lations.”
The move has had
a number of knock-on
effects, however: earlier
this week, students were
informed their previous
exam records had been
deleted, and they would
need to retake all their
examinations again.
Florence Mayhugh, a
third year physicist, told
Hangman how it had af-
fected her: “I really didn’t
do that well in my first
few sets of exams, and I
always said I’d love the
chance to redo them, but
that was a load of bullshit.
Let’s be honest: I didn’t
know the topics then, and
I don’t know them now.”
The College Archive
has also been hit by the
destruction of data. Poppy
Estby, the College’s
archivist, had her office
ransacked in the early
hours of Friday morning:
“I kept getting these
You can’t breach data protection laws if you’ve for no data // CC
emails asking whether
my archive was GDPR
compliant,” Estby told
Hangman, “and I just pre-
sumed they were spam, so
I ignored them. But then
I came in on Friday, and
the archive was just gone.
Completely empty.”
Rathbone confirmed
the archive had been
destroyed, but was unable
to tell Hangman what
the space would be used
for: “There are currently
a number of options for
what we do with the
space; we’re aware that
the counselling service is
in need of more rooms,
but re-generating the Col-
lege’s data from scratch
is going to be a big job.
We’ll probably just move
some faculty staff there.”
“Students
were informed
their previous
exam records
has been
deleted, and
they would
need to retake
them”

The frequent crashes

D
eliveroo driv-
ers will be
banned from
campus, in a
new effort to battle the
exam-season multi-bike
pile-ups occurring
around College.
Earlier this week, after
two Deliveroo drivers
crashed into each other
outside Central Library,
the College issued new
guidance on the topic,
permanently banning all
takeaway deliveries from
College property.
Adam Rigley, Vice
Provost (Millennial
Communications), told
Hangman: “We strongly
value our students’
welfare, and we under-
stand they want a supply
of hot food while they
study in the library, but the
sheer number of delivery
drivers around College is
becoming a health hazard
for staff, students, and
visitors.”
“We’ve become used
to seeing fixie bikes
swarming around campus,
making it nearly impos-
sible for people to get
around. The number of
accidents has also been
increasing – last week
campus security reported
close to three dozen inci-
dents, leading to several
students being taken to
the hospital, and nearly
£500 worth of food being
spilled. I don’t think we’ll
ever get rid of the smell of
chicken katsu curry from
the main entrance.”
The move has shocked
and dismayed some
students. Eloise Hitchins,
a third year materials
student, had been relying
on Deliveroo for between
two to three meals each
day: “it started out just
occasionally,” she told
Hangman, “I’d get the odd
dinner here or there. But
as exam season has hit,
I need to defend my seat
lazy to bother cooking
anything for myself. This
is an infringement of our
civil liberties.”
In a statement for
Hangman, a College
representative said: “We
understand the banning of
food deliveries has caused
concern on campus, but
it was done to protect
student and staff safety.
We recommend students
purchase food from one
of our many outlets across
the South Kensington
campus. But not after
6pm. They’re all closed
then.”
Deliveroo drivers to be banned on campus
This week you’re an
underpaid academic,
and you’re sick and tired
of the massive costs of
living in London. BRING
FUSION PRICES BACK
DOWN.
This week you finally
complete your slow-
descent into exam-
induced madness, and
run naked across campus.
Nobody notices, they’re
too busy studying.
This week you get the
chance to chronicle all
the people you’ve let
down since you came to
uni. That’s right, the Felix
Sex Survey is open! (bit.
ly/felixsexsurvey)
This week you complete
so many problem sheets
they’re all you can see
when you close your
eyes. Your nights are
haunted by advanced
quantum mechanics.
Makes a change from
exam anxiety dreams.
This week you’ve eaten
so much instant ramen,
your body just can’t
process normal food any
more. Looks like it’s a
lifetime of MSG for you!
This week you find
the questions on your
physics paper pretty
difficult. You’re not sure
whether you don’t know
the topics, or whether
whoever wrote the paper
has a tenuous grasp on
basic English language.
This week the Union
has been handing out
energy bars and water
in Central Library.
You’re disappointed your
suggestion of ‘vitamin
shots’ wasn’t listened to.
This week you double-
down on your efforts
to sneak hot food into
Central Library, and
manage to hide a whole
cheese fondue set under
your jumper. You get a
seat because people think
you’re pregnant.
This week you offer your
seat to a pregnant woman
in the library. Shortly
afterwards, she starts
chopping up cheese for
her fondue. Man, exam
season is weird.
This week you celebrate
your last exam by getting
Euler’s identity tattooed
on you arm, but the tattoo
artist gets it wrong. You
manage to look like a
nerd and an idiot.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
you wonder why you
spent so much time
writing this shit, and so
little time doing your
work. Still worth it.

times – it’s one of the only

Deliveroo allowed me to
leave my seat for around
a minute, but if I’ve got
to go and queue up at an
Imperial outlet my seat is
gonna be nicked for sure.”
Harry Jacobson, a
second-year mechanical
engineering student, said
the move impinged on his
rights as a student: “We’re
not children, we’re
adults,” he told Hangman,

restaurant to my computer
