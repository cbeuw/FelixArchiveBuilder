Free speech at UK universities today is under
attack
Policies designed to prevent harassment or distress are being used across the country to stop
debate – a cornerstone of the university experience.

F
reedom of speech
is under attack.
University policy
must be reversed,
and we must do all we
can to defend this fun-
damental human right.
As students, we need to
understand that everyone
has different opinions,
perspectives, and political
persuasions. Healthy
discussion and debate is a
great part of the university
experience. However, a
drive for complete inclu-
sivity prevents and polices
subjects deemed offensive
from being discussed.
transgender rights might
have offended audience
members. Bristol Uni-
versity’s student union
are banning speakers
who question the gender
identity of trans women.
“Safe space” policies
at universities up and
down the country ensure
students don’t hear
anything deemed offen-
sive. The National Union
of Students and some uni-
versities employ “no-plat-
forming” policies that bar
individuals or groups that
may be deemed offensive.
However, students have
used this policy to silence
legitimate debate, with
victims including the gay
vegetarian activist Peter
Tatchwell and the feminist
writer Germain Greer.
When students leave
the safe university bubble
and enter the real world
we will be exposed to
constant offence. These
policies will prevent
students from having
the necessary social
tool kit to deal with this
successfully. Students
have been exploiting uni-
versity policies to prevent
speakers with contrary
views from speaking, thus
infringing a person’s right
to freedom of speech.

Union states that freedom
of speech needs to be
balanced with their
commitment to equality
and diversity. What does
this mean? Are you not
allowed to use gender
specific words, debate
LBGTQ+ rights, and
comment on religious
extremism? Or does it
prevent you from saying
anything at all controver-
sial? Who is the arbitrator
(or who are the thought
police)?
In accordance with
this policy, an Imperial
biology undergraduate
student is reportedly said
to have been criticised
and centre.
Imperial College
London’s harassment,
bullying and victimisation
policy (HBV) frame-
work makes “offensive
comments relating to a
person’s sexuality” unac-
ceptable. Bullying or har-
assing an individual about
their sexuality, race, or
religion is unacceptable,
and is already illegal under
UK law, when distress is
caused. However, does
the wording of the HBV
framework inadvertently
prevent a healthy debate
about transgender issues?

“Healthy
discussion
and debate
is a great and
necessary
part of the
university
experience”
for using the scientific
word “hermaphrodite”
by a peer because of
the offence it may have
caused. I fear that the time
will come when students
are frightened of using
other scientific vocabu-
lary like “Homo sapiens”
because of its perceived
offence and subsequent
violation of Union policy.
Arguably, this will stifle
scientific communication.
However this policy is
interpreted and enforced,
it will inevitably curb free
speech, and I am worried
that free speech at this
university and others is
being eroded left, right,
Students and staff at
Cardiff Metropolitan
University have faced
disciplinary action for
using gender specific
words. “Forefathers”
and “sportsmanship” are
included in the list of 34
words that have been
banned at the university.
The feminist and equal
rights advocate Linda
Bellos had her speaking
invitation revoked by
Cambridge University
because her views on
“I am worried
that free
speech at this
university
and others is
being eroded
left, right, and
centre”
But why, you may ask,
is freedom of speech so
important? The right to
challenge religious doc-
trines brought about the
development of science. It
would be a retrograde step
if Imperial, of all places,
through its curbing of
free speech, takes us back
to the dark ages when
humans thought the Earth
was flat and created in six
days. Free speech allows
you to think, debate,
criticise, and enquire;
surely the bedrock of any
self-respecting univer-
sity? If we have to have
“safe spaces”, why not
have them for freedom of
speech?
