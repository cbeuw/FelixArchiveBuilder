It’s hard to see your revision not pay off in exam success.
Throw yourself into your work 100% and, by next week, all
your ambitions will be fulfilled! Don’t be afraid of your suc-
cess, embrace it.
Don’t take your personal tutor’s remarks about your lack of
work too seriously. Jupiter is in alignment with something,
somewhere, so everything is okay. Plus you’ve done five past
papers. Pint?
Your work life is affecting your social life to a detrimental
amount now. Don’t be afraid to cast off the shackles and let
loose once you are free, and never be afraid to take the
night off!
Next Tuesday, you are going to be getting a big promise
from someone. Don’t be to too proud to heed friend’s advice
that accepting such things at face value may not be a good
idea.
Your star chart seems to suggest that you will now be moving
into a happy phase. You may be wary, but you shouldn’t be.
When your friend suggests something at 2pm on Thursday,
say yes. Unless you don’t want to.
Some investigation goes a lot further than you may think.
Leave Monday to think, and make a definite decision on
Tuesday. Don’t take too long to deliberate though, this op-
portunity is once in a lifetime.
It seems that financially things may be suddenly on the up, but
with a slight, strange, and out-of-the-blue downturn on the
horizon. Save up, for you don’t know what the future holds.
Attempt to put something away for a rainy day.
Pluto is no longer a planet and so doesn’t matter anymore.
However, Mars is shining brightly and is turning as it always
does. A fun adventure, and novel prospect, is on the horizon
for you to grab with both hands, if you want to.
You’ve reached a stalemate. Do not fear, all will pass once
Saturn moves into perfect alignment with Mercury later this
month. You’ll just have to wait it out, and maybe go to The
Summer Ball to take your mind off of it.
Don’t artificially try to be good at things that you don’t know.
Stick to what you are best at and all will be fine. A little time
by yourself is incredibly therapeutic and often very calming.
Challenges may lie ahead and so keep a cool head.
Your suave demeanour will get you what you have always
wanted later on this week. It may take a few days longer
than planned, but wearing your best clothes is a must this
week, or opportunity may not knock.
It is never too late to mend your broken bridges. With Venus
on your side, now is the time to rekindle that intense friend-
ship. Shyness is all that is keeping you away, and you should
leave that at the door.
