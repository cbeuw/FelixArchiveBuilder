NEW MICROSOFT TABLET:
Comment sections across the internet were ablaze
last night with flame wars between Apple and Mi-
crosoft fanboys. Not a constructive point was in sight
as Microsoft’s new tablet surfaced. Accusations of one
company copying another sparked arguments about
whether magnets sticking to each other is a new inven-
tion, and occasionally someone would mention some
sort of “Android”.
The Surface is no longer a touch-screen table – oh no
– now it’s a normal-sized tablet. Well, it’s two tablets.
There’s a slower, lighter one, and a powerful, more
expensive one, both running the must-have operating
system of 2012 – Windows 8.
With its screen cover/keyboard that comes in five
different colours, the Surface is guaranteed to always
match your outfit and home decor, and that alone
makes it the gadget of the year.
We many not know how much it’s going to cost, or
when it’s being released, but who cares when it’s either
thinner than an iPad or more powerful than a Trans-
former Prime on steroids?
When this does arrive in stores, you’d better make
sure you buy one, or you’re going to look so last year.

WOW!
I would probably buy
one just to put two
fingers up to smug,
predictably boring,
pretentious Mac geeks
Windows 8 being an “iPad killer”? Five
words: So, good luck with that.
Wait, did you just ask if
Apple should be scared
of this? You mean like
they were scared of the
Zune?
Shut up and take my
money, Microsoft

Just one more addition
to Microsoft’s
masterpieces
Yawn...
