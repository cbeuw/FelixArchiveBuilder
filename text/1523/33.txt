IMPERIAL PUZZLES
BEAT THE EXPERTS!
Think you know relationships better than our experts? Each week, our relationships expert Jimmy Hook-Up tells all about
who to look out for and who to look away from! Can you get all 6 right?
This week: How faithful is your boyfriend? Using the science of medicology, Jimmy says that the best way you can tell a no good
cheater is by the shape of his ears. So, do you think you know your men? Can you match the ear shape to how he shapes up?

1. The classic manipulator.This
ear may look sympathetic, but
is it really listening? A no go,
but a difficult one to spot. If
you want to live in blissful
ignorance, it’s up to you...
2.Always calm and composed,
the steady ship on rocky
waves. If the dull life is what
you crave, you’re on to a real
winner. Not a cheater, but
Jimmy says “abandon ship!”
3. Another innocent, but not
always emotionally invested.
Good for a while, but you’ll
soon despair over the same
bunch of flowers you get
every week...
4. This guy climbs the girl-
friend ladder and you’re just
another rung. But if you don’t
let him stand on you, he’ll
tumble to the ground. Make
sure it’s a nasty fall, ladies!
5. If your self-esteem hasn’t
been already shot by this los-
er, you’re one strong willed
gal. Turn around and never
look back, unless you want
to see another woman in his
arms...
6.The parasite. He’ll cling and
never let go as he feeds off
your ambition. If you value
your sanity, send him back to
his mum’s basement...

FAUX FASHION FIVE!
It’s that time of the week
again, we’re back with
another edition of Faux
Fashion Five!
Go up against our style
expert Miss Jegging and see
if you can identify the five
fashion faux pas in the pic-
ture.This week, our Cheryl
has been caught in London
and it’s not a five star per-
formance.
Simply circle the five hor-
rendous fashion errors in
the photo left and send it
in to the usual address for
your chance to win a par-
ticularly fashionable Jimmy-
Who? shoe with a classic,
tearaway, worn retro feel
that is presumably in this
summer.
MADCAP MAZE!
It’s a rush to the beach for the summer, but Abby’s for-
gotten the cellulite cream (that you should also buy).
Help her through the maze and quickly before all the
good tanning spots are taken by people better looking
and successful than her (can you identify with Abby? I
thought so...).
