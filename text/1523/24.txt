JE KIFFE TON STYLE – WORDS AND ENNUI FROM PARIS
Bonjour all and sundry!
After almost a year of
negotiations and some
rather shady deals, edi-
tor Matt Colvin’s evil al-
ter-ego Watt Wolvin has
managed to find me some
space in the final issue of
the year. I feel sorry for
all you poorly-dressed
Rosbifs , having had to
rely on the dubious coun-
sel of the charmante but
slightly clueless Fashion
Editor who pretends to do
physics in her spare time.
Pas de panique! LeTwerp is
here to save you.
Bon. I am not here to be
petty and bitch about
people, that is what the
catwalk is for. I will, how-
ever, explain to you prop-
erly what is making ‘le
buzz’ in Paris for the next
season, and hopefully sal-
vage your look so that it
is not immediately obvi-
ous that you come from
the perfide Albion, as we

Indy LeTwerp in St Michel de Rieufret, in the Paris suburbs
like to call it here in la Glo-
rieuse République. Here
we go:
Capes
eh oui, my friends! You
may go to the most so-
cially inept and style-un-
conscious university in the
world, but it seems that
Givenchy, Tom Ford and
Martin Margiela have
taken a leaf out of the one
of the many books pre-
sent in the West basement
library (honnêtement, it’s
like the new Centre Pompi-
dou) and have put capes
everywhere. Superman or
Jon Snow? Take your pick.
But who am I kidding? –
you know nothing (about
fashion).
Monochrome prints
C’est simple. Black and
white. One and zéro. An-
other trend that you geeks
can understand, then. You
know that guy in you lec-
tures who dresses all in
black? Yes, the one with
so much grease in his hair
that it needs a bailout.
You thought he was some
kind of loser, hein? Well,
he is. But this season he’s
also fashionable! Which is
of course much more im-
portant.
Purple
So, word on la rue is that
fabulous royal purple is
going to be all the rage
this autumn. Spot on for
the graduation gowns,
n’est-ce pas? Personally, it
bringsmebacktothedays
of the monarchy and our
dear, headless Louis XVI.
Word of warning: blood
red and purple don’t go
well together. Guillotines
are so 18th century – so
all you republican Anglais
come to France, instead
of chopping your Queen’s
head off. That tasteless
Charles, king? Surtout pas!
Enfin voilà, that’s all the
room Wolvin will let me
have. Stupid frog. Basi-
cally, dress like a 1950s
superhero with boxing
Tu m’as donné ta
boue et j’en ai fait
de l’or.
Campus scouring by
Alice Yang and Alex Ramadan
gloves and you will have
a look de folie. Or you’ll
just look crazy. In fashion,
it is always a fine line, mes
amis. Adieu!
