The Imperial Eagles Handball Club
has won the most prestigious universi-
ty sports tournament in France and de-
nied the hosts the 11th successive title.
Every year the Ecole Centrale Lyon
hosts one of the biggest sports tourna-
ments in Europe, when all engineering
schools in the country send sports del-
egations to the south of France in order
to compete in a variety of disciplines.
8,000 students roam the campus of the
University for one weekend in March
to determine the best sports teams and
crown the overall champion. Guillau-
me Dufresne, the first ever team cap-
tain of the Imperial College Handball
Club and former student at said school
has established a friendly relationship
between the two schools, which lead to
Imperial being the only foreign univer-

Imperial Eagles: probably the best
University Handball in France
sity to be invited to compete.
Despite this privilege, which is a
welcome opportunity to get some com-
petitive games, it has proven difficult
to stand up to the teams from France,
the first nation to hold the Olympic,
World and European titles at the time.
In the year 2008, a team of merely 7
players travelled to the continent in
search of fame, but returned with 4
defeats in the group stages and the set
of white shirts they had to draw their
names on, because the club did not
even have a kit back then. The follow-
ing year, Imperial managed to over-
come a few of their opponents, but
missed out on the knock-out stages be-
cause of goal difference and some rath-
er questionable refereeing on behalf of
the hosts. In 2010 the squad became
larger and players from previous years
would return to the club for one week-
end to celebrate and play handball.
However, the celebration appeared to
get in the way of the handball. A strong
group draw paired with an even stron-
ger hangover lead to Imperial having
to surrender to the French again. Al-
though not very successful, this year
proved to be the turning point for the
club and their sporting ambition, be-
cause in 2011 Imperial would come
back much stronger. At that time, the
club was renowned for its off-court in-
volvement. The Eagles were loved and
treasured by all their fellow sportsmen
and sportswomen as friends, but this
was the year they would be feared as
opponents. After some superb Hand-
ball in the group stages, including an
impressive win against Lille (finalist
that year), the Eagles had made it into
the knock-out stages for the first time.
The quarter final was played in the big
sports hall with many spectators and
entire battalions of fanfares to support
their opponent - Centrale Nancy also
known as the alligators or the Nancy-
Boys. The big stage turned out to be
too much for the Eagles, who failed to
convert 3 clear chances to take the lead
in the dying minutes of the second half
and lost by merely one goal. The girls
team, in their maiden year, were re-
markably successful in their group and
reached the quarterfinals too, where
they would suffer a similar fate to the
men’s team.
It was an agonising wait for the next
chance to show the world what the club
has become over the last 4 years, but it
came at the UK University Champion-
ships in February. Imperial comfort-
ably beat future champions Essex in
the group stages and only narrowly
lost to the hosts from Manchester Uni-
versity in the penalty shoot-out of the
semifinals. A strong defensive display
and the incredible fighting spirit were
rewarded with third place in the end,
but it was devastating for everyone
involved to come so close to a place
in the final and yet go home with the
bronze medal around their neck. The
team continued to work hard and two
weeks later would cruise to a comfort-
able second place in the charity dodge-
ball tournament at which point Lucas
Carstens said “3rd in Manchester, 2nd
in dodgeball,... We sall come 1st in
Lyon!”
On 16 March, Eagles from across Eu-
rope spread their wings and gathered in
Lyon. For the first time, Imperial could
enter 2 men’s teams into the competi-
tion and a women’s team, forming a
delegation of 32 players. This shows
the success the club has had and how
much hard work went into the devel-
opment of Handball at Imperial. Tal-
