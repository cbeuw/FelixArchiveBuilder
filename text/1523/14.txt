Last Saturday saw the return of Fe-
lix Music Night for their final party
of the year and boy, was it a party.
Things were kicked off with an uplift-
ing jazz & bass set from Phrij. Accom-
panying his selection, Gabor Kerekes
shone the hynotic motion of oils,
colours and washing up liquid swirling
through each other through an old-
school over-head projector (top).
This was followed by wonderful jazz
musicianship of disco funk outfit
Spank Alley (middle), the brash and
crass noise rock of trio Nipples (bot-
tom) and the usual glorious insanity
of Operation Midnight Climax.
With the line-up thus far reading like
a night at a rather sordid bar, the
first representatives from the label
headliners, XVI Records, stepped
up. Evermean, DJ and MC, tore the
place up playing the best in London’s
recent bass and garage music surge.
Running a bit behind schedule, the
headline act for the night stepped
up, flown in from Luxembourg for
one night only: Sunglitters. He took
things down a notch with his beauti-
ful, blissed-out and soulful electron-
ica, weaving r&b samples through
dizzying electronics. However the
crowd began to itch for something to
make them bounce and with that, up
stepped My Panda Shall Fly who pro-
ceeded to play a rip-roaring garage
set, even including a little Craig Da-
vid.
The night was a huge amount of fun,
with most people leaving more than
a little sweaty. The perfect sign-off
for the Felix Music Nights this year.
