THE DRESS
With the summer quick-
ly settling in, there’s no
doubt that the most
talked about show come
September will be Raf
Simons’ inauguration at
the House of Christian
Dior. Up your fashion
credentials for the inevi-
table discussions by tak-
ing a swirl through the
House’s overflowing cou-
ture archives.
From 1947 when the
designer himself first em-
barked on his journey to
changethefundamentals
of style, to the dramatic
pieces mastered by John
Galliano and the most
recently debated show
under Bill Gaytten; eve-
rything you could possi-
bly want in a dress can
be found on the pages
of this book.
So whether its artistic
elegance or flamboy-
ant originality, this book
makes for the perfect
summer escapade and a
great conversation start-
er for when the autumn
shows kick in.

THE MAN
Regardlessofwhetherornot
you’ve had your fill of well-
dressed perfectly toned
gentlemen from the Impe-
rial Library over the exam
period, the truth is there
can never be too much eye-
candy. In fact, for those of
us still praying that the next
time we walk through those
(still confusing) double doors
that we shall find our prince,
its time to admit defeat and
turn trustingly to our friends
Dolce & Gabbana.
Should you dare to take
a few moments away from
THE SHOES
‘Shoes have a magical, al-
most mythical hold on our
imaginations’ – the bliss-
fully true sentence with
which this book’s foreword
begins tells the fairy tale
story of how Tamara Mel-
lon and Jimmy Choo came
to be. The gold-gilded
edges of this book promise
an incredible story, and un-
like some of those summer
chick-lits you will not be left
disappointed.
The thick pages inside are
to a shoe obsessive what
money is to a banker. The
simple satin crossover of
Macy, the tough-zipped el-
egance of Gleny’s, and of
course the thinly-strapped
fame of Lance; this book
epitomises the best of Jim-
my Choo, creating a shrine
for its 15 most revered
styles. From red-carpet
glamour to lustful cam-
paigns, this book is quite lit-
erally shoe heaven. In fact,
when the holidays have left
your statements in the red,
this book will be almost as
good as going shoe shop-
ping itself.
ESSENTIAL READS
Alice Yang’s list of books bound to give you more than just a pick-me-up
reality over the summer
for this jewel, you will find
nothing less than 270
pages of swoon. David
Gandy, aka THAT gor-
geously chiselled guy
who advertises the la-
bel’s fragrances by casu-
ally being half-naked
on a boat (see below),
now has an entire book
in which he poses (some-
what provocatively) in
what can only be de-
scribed as generally not
much clothing. Tearing
yourself away from those
abs may be your biggest
challenge yet.
With compliment from the edi-
tor – you can thank me later
