BREAKING DAWN: PART 2
PREVIEW
At a recent Twilight conven-
tion, “actress” Kristen Stew-
art promised fans and critics her
last ever outing as Bella Swan
in Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight
series will be with a bang. She,
her boyfriend Robert Pattinson
and Taylor Lautner wowed the
audience with spectacular nev-
er-before-heard exclusive pre-
view information on their hotly
anticipated upcoming movie,
Breaking Dawn: Part 2.
“We decided this time” moaned
Stewart, “not to follow the
book, like, at all. I know how
disappointed you all were so
the director [Bill Condon] and
the three of us took matters into
our own hands. We decided to
vamp it up a notch.” The crowd
broke into laughter at that joke.
“We wanted to give you some-
thing complex and thought-pro-
voking.”
They followed
on with spoil-
ers including
how Jacob’s
imprinting on
Edward and
Bella’s vam-
pire daugh-
ter actually
leads to the
werewolf’s
uncontrolla-
ble sexual hunger and frenzy.
“Very exciting stuff, we’ll actu-
ally get to see Taylor act in this
one. He’s been getting away
with not doing anything and got
paid millions of dollars for it but
here, he’s got the most challeng-
ing role” said
Pattinson.
“Yeah I’m
nervous as
hell!” trem-
bled Lautner,
“I’ve never
acted in my
life. Never
ever. God...
this will be
such a differ-
ent experi-
ence! Look at me, I’m shaking!
Although, sexual frustration isn’t
something that’s really new to
me. All I have to do is to channel
whatever I felt when I saw Rob
getting down and dirty with
Kristen. And trust me, there’s
been a lot of that on the set. So
I think I can manage.”
Continuing on with the suck-up
routine, Stewart added “look, I
know you guys felt nothing with
that lame sex scene Robert and
I had, but just you wait until you
see Taylor get it on with my
grown-up vampire child. Now
we’re talking! That’s what teen
dramas are all about right? Hot
animalistic sex. That’s exactly
what you’ll get” Breaking Dawn:
Part 2 will be released Novem-
ber 2012, and has been rated
18.
Final Twilight film set to rewrite franchise history
We decided
this time not
to follow the
book, like, at
all.
