Dear Matt.
I’ve been having a lot of problems recently.
I feel like my bachelor days are over! When
I watch Made in Chelsea I just somehow feel
that I’m missing out. What do women like in a
man? Looking forward to your reply!
Love,
Charlie B
Dear Charlie,
First of all, thank you so much for
your ‘excellent work as Deputy Editor and
thoroughly deserved Union Colours’.
To answer your question: it’s very hard. Con-
cerns must at least be considered. I’d say your
best bet is to find a way to get yourself into
the Telegraph. One hastily written article deep
on their website and BOOM – you’ll be fighting
them off with a stick! Maybe.

Dear Matt,
I’ve been told that I get too
“aggro” when I’m drunk.
What can I do to rectify it?
Is it just my Essex routes
coming through?
I’m going abroad next year
and am worried I’ll acciden-
tally have a racist friend get
me in trouble, what can I do?
Look forwad to the reply,
W.P.
Dear W.P.,
Be proud of your roots,
but make sure to
LEAVE IT YEAH.
Matt
Dear Matt,
I’m at a loss. I use tumblr every second of the
day and still nobody listens to anything I say.
My sex life is suffering. The other day I real-
ised that I can’t ejaculate unless I am think-
ing of a gif of a 1930s black and white
cartoon. I find myself at my desk tweeting
Instagram photos non stop and hoping
for some retweets. To top this all off, my
ironic moustache is way too thin!
Please reply soon I’m at a loss,
Allan Matthewson

WRITE FOR FELIX!
This term, and indeed year, is
coming to an end both academi-
cally and for Felix. Firstly I’d like
to just say congratulations to
Matt for a great year of Felix.
His pro- fessionalism
and un-
flapabble
nature un-
der pressure
are admirable.
I’m looking forward to next year
and hope you are two. If you want
to get involved in any way, then
feel free to get in contact with
me, or just stop me if you see me
walking around campus (to find me,
look at roughly eye level, then turn
your gaze down about a foot). If you
want to be an editor, writer, illustra-
tor, photographer, layout designer,
or copy editor (if you noticed and
were annoyed by the use of “two”
instead of “too” earlier then this
one’s for you). All you have to do
is say you’re interested and there
will definitely be something for you
to do. It’s a great break from writ-
ing lab reports (honestly), and may
even help improve them. Or, you
know, you could just use the office
for free tea and coffee.
