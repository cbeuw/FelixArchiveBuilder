V&A "Boilerhouse
at Last Hurdle
rr
News in Brief.
DAVID ROBERTS
Designs for the Victoria & Albert
Museum enter the final planning
stage this week, amid a flurry of
criticism.
The design, a high-tech structure
known as "the Spiral" or more criti-
cally "the Boilerhouse", has led to its
architect, Daniel Libeskind, being
described as "architecture's Pol Pot".
Critics claim that the new build-
ing will be a blot on the classical
buildings that surround it, viewing
the design as "an explosion in a
cardboard box factory". Libeskind,
however, is used to such criticism.
His previous work includes Berlin's
Jewish M u s e u m , which led to the
young Polish architect being branded
the "destroyer of Berlin". His design
includes seven great "voids", and
the entire structure is based around
lines plotted from the museum to
the homes of 1050 pre-war Jews.
Yet his design for the £ 7 5 million
pound extension to the current
museum is utterly different. It is a
futuristic plan, designed to create
the correct setting for the museum's
huge selection of contemporary art.
By utilising NASA computer technol-
ogy, the he has created a seven
storey building, coated in massive
ceramic tiles, yet with no internal
framework. Libeskind describes it as
"unlike any spiral that's ever been
built, because there's not a centre or
a single apex...it's a vertical slice
through time".
The design brief called for some-
thing that would make a "hugely
avant garde statement about the
site" - and the project director,
Gwyn Miles, feels that the design
Libeskind produced was "spot o n " .
In an unprecedented move, the brief
also insisted that the new building
would have to be capable of lasting
another 120 years. Consequently,
Libeskind has produced something
which he believes will fit into the
twenty-first century, "a craft and a
culture for eternity".
The plans go to the Royal
Borough of Kensington &. Chelsea
planning committee this week, and if
given the go-ahead, building work
will commence in earnest later this
year.
LEAGUE TABLES
Imperial has once again been
placed third in The Times universi-
ty league table, published last
week. Cambridge was top, with
Oxford beating Imperial into third
place by just three points out of a
possible t h o u s a n d . In The
Financial Times table, published
earlier this month, Imperial came
second with Oxford top. What
makes The Times table interesting,
if not dubious, is Imperial's score
of 85 for research, much lower
than previous years and placing it
eleven points behind O x f o r d .
Imperial kept its third place by
scoring a high 93 in the staff-stu-
dent category and a m a x i m u m
100 for facilities spending, a find-
ing that will no doubt please the
college and bemuse many stu-
dents. Other London universities
in the top ten were the London
School of Economics and Political
Science and University College,
with King's College being placed
18th.
The change in Imperial's
'strong' categories from last year,
coupled with the marked differ-
ences between different league
tables, can only fuel doubts as to
the worth and even validity of the
league table system.
BIOCHEM FLOOD
Flooding occurred on three levels
of the Department of Biochemistry
last Friday when the hose to a
water p u m p o n an overnight
experiment split. The sink below
had become blocked and, as a
consequence, water spilled out
into the lab and adjoining corridor
and then d o w n to the two levels
below, where the departmental
stores are located. Fortunately
most of the stock in the affected
area was salvaged. The flooding
was discovered by Security early
Friday morning. The Departmental
Superintendent, M i c k Rogers,
declined to comment, saying that
this sort of thing happens every
day. H e did say, however, that in
his opinion there are not enough
people around at that time to look
out for faults in equipment used in
experiments.
