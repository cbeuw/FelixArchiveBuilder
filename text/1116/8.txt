F
ive years after their last LP,
Cuckoo, Curve have finally
tackled that 'difficult' third
album with all the finesse of a
2 5 0 1 b line-backer. In their absence
they have been hailed as the origi-
nators of a sound lifted wholesale
by Garbage and Sneaker Pimps, a
comparison that is trotted out in
EVERY SINGLE REVIEW of work by
either band (see h o w easy it is to
fall into the cliche trap, N o r m a n .
M u s t d o better...). The trouble with
canonising d e a d heroes in this
manner is that w h e n they are rean-
imated, the corrupted, flesh hang-
ing from their shambling frames,
they never s e e m quite as attractive
as y o u remember. Sure, their defin-
ing characteristics are still there -
the goth-hop industrialism, Toni
Halliday' s frosty come-ons - but
W H E R E A R E T H E G O D D A M N
TUNES? It's as though half the
album has been remixed to afford
the surgical removal of any melody
whatsoever. W h e n taken to its log-
ical extreme by the likes of
Witchman (a sometime collabora-
tor), this abrasive deflowering may
have some merit, but the slick pro-
duction renders tracks like Dirty
High too anaemic to have any real
impact. In their quieter moments
(Cotton Candy, Beyond Reach), the
gaze is drawn shoe-ward, the trip
stumbles rather than hops (thanks
to Tim Simenon), and it just allows
us to hear s o m e truly awful lyrics.
Remember Chinese Burn, used on
the Sony M i n i d i s c campaign?
Apparently "It cuts her up like Irish
mortar / Mother's Pride is what w e
taught her". Er, right.
Recovery is a glimpse of old
glories, powerful riff w h i p p e d into
shape by blue steel distortion. A n d
as the dry ice begins to creep from
m y stereo, Something Familiar
turns out to be just that, a passable
rehash of Frozen. But a rehash
nonetheless, a n d it's just not
enough to rescue an album that
would've just about made a g o o d
EP. M y advice is to seek out the
Pubic Fruit collection of EPs, and
return Come Clean to it's rightful
place - the grave. El

CATHERINE WHEEL THE PECADILOES
Adam And Eve * *
F
or any of you w h o think that
this is Catherine W h e e l ' s
debut album, I can under-
stand why y o u continue to believe
this m i s c o n c e p t i o n . They have
returned once again with their fifth
album and we must ask ourselves,
what happened to the last four?
It appears that the band have
been touring constantly since their
debut, in the effort of trying to
drum up s o m e kind of fan bass, 1
almost had the pleasure of seeing
them myself, w h e n supporting the
Bluetones in '96, but thankfully I
got Geneva instead, a band w h o
comparatively have c o m e a long
way since then. I then found out
that they have also supported Bush
throughout America and one can
only ponder h o w they managed
such a thing.
Throughout this touring, some-
thing in the band has changed.
O n c e a band very dark in its sound
and reasonably heavy, it seems
they may have been affected by the
success of indie, as the new album
is m u c h lighter, almost to the
extent that they resemble an early
Del Amitri, but lacking the singer or
the tunes. Trying to conceive that
this band could squeeze a single
from this LP is hard, as no song
even catches your attention and
the w o r d s ' meanings are so vague,
perhaps in an attempt to be deep
or humourous.
It's always a s h a m e to see any
band transform their sound, purely
for the sake of popularity. It rarely
works, but for Catherine Wheel it
has resulted in even worse. At least
when they were playing their type
of music, it was bad music that you
in s o m e ways had to respect them
for, but n o w it's just bad music in
an attempt to tap into the indie
sounds of the moment. 1

Caught On Venus * * *
T
he first thing to notice about
the Pecadiloes is their rubbish
name and how gay they look
on the inner sleeve. Out of interest
I looked up pecadilo in the dictio-
nary and discovered that not only
was it spelt with a double T but
that it meant a 'trivial offense'. It
was therefore a great disappoint-
ment to find that this album is not
crap because it would have made
for a very easy review.
The music is quite nice in an
inoffensive kind of way. At first lis-
ten it would be easy to write this lot
off as dull indie almost rans but lis-
ten again and y o u are rewarded
with a variety of interesting effects
and sounds that you didn't notice
the first time. There is a definite
punk feel to the album; harsh whis-
pered and screaming vocals. But it
is also very funky with plenty of
thick bass underlying each track.
Stand out tracks include the
Wanting Song and Deep Reversal
which both provide plenty of the
above.
The biggest problem with the
album is that the songs are all far
too similar (with the exception of
Kirsten's Beach which comes over
all calypso). All too often 1 was
checking my C D player thinking I
was still listening to one track only
to find that we had in fact moved
on. Still, if y o u like what you hear,
which 1 d i d , then this is not too
great a crime. If y o u have all the
g o o d releases from the last few
weeks or so and still have a spare
thirteen q u i d lying around y o u
could d o a lot worse than this. El
