W
elcome to the Electric Cafe for this
week. First of all, d o n ' t forget that
today (Friday 2 2 n d M a y ) the Electric
Cafe will be descending on the Union for a
whole night at the controls of the chillout r o o m .
If y o u have read the c o l u m n or listened to the
radio show and w o u l d like to see the cafe in a
more "live" atmosphere, or if y o u just want to
come d o w n and check out s o m e forward think-
ing, relaxed electronic music, then please c o m e
d o w n this week.
The main feature of the c o l u m n this week is
the drum'n'bass outfit King Kooba. Consisting of
two childhood friends (DJ Shuff
and Charlie Tate), the Koobas
have amassed critical acclaim for <
their recent album The Imperial
Solution, which is out on their o w n T Â»
label, S e c o n d Skin Records, i
caught up with them and asked S n i
them about "live drum'n'bass",
life and the universe...
Can you explain what you do in
terms of music for people who
have never heard of you before?
Shuff: Basically w e ' v e just
completed our first album, called
the Imperial Solution, w h i c h is a
sort of jazz-orientated dance-style
album. There are a few downbeat
tracks on it, but basically the main
concentration on the first album
was a sort of d'n'b style. W e ' v e been together
for about two or three now; working and of late
progressing into more of a variety of styles. But
the main agenda is a sort of jazz origin.
So taking jazz music and pushing it further?
Shuff: Yes.
Would you describe yourselves as a d'n'b out-
fit?
Shuff: Well we're trying to avoid it, but obvi-
ously it does happen. U p to this point a lot of
the material has been of a d'n'b type but w e are
endeavouring to w i d e n our spectrum as such
and work on different styles in the future. W e ' v e
got s o m e big-beat vibes w h i c h w e are going to
push through.
Do you find pressure in that because people
might tend to concentrate on one style and
criticise you for being too broad?
Shuff: Yeah there is a danger of that, but
basically the criteria is that if it is a quality piece
of music, then whatever vibe it is, it's going to
get the respect it deserves. If we're g o i n g to d o
something on a big-beat or downbeat level then
the chances are that we'll get s o m e o n e in or d o
a remix ourselves on a m o r e dancefloor orien-
tated vibe anyway.
You're very much a live act. How do you
approach the live aspect of your music?
Charlie: I suppose Shuff's the DJ and I c o m e
from a more kind of musical background. I was
playing live music for years. So it was quite easy
for me, despite the fact that it was d'n'b. But
there were ways around it and I knew h o w to
crack the live angle. I wouldn't say the live thing
is particularly faithful to the album but I'm not
afraid of that. I think that's the whole point. If
you're getting musicians involved then they're
going to interpret things and I'm not going to tell
them "You're playing that w r o n g . " So lots of
other things would come out of the fact that that
it's been taken live and tunes are taking their o w n
direction. I think that's a g o o d thing. I think the
result is going to show in the next set of materi-
al w e put out. W e are definitely going to put
Shuff: The main factor is that if w e o w n our
label w e can put out the music w e want. It
allows us to keep our artistic morals as such.
With jazz being your main influence, why do
think that form of music has inspired so many
different dance mutations, from pure techno
right through to d'n'b?
Shuff: Because the term jazz is a freeform
style of music. It is all about working on certain
m o o d s and tonal qualities rather than making
pop tunes. It is more about feeling and h o w you
can throw out the rule book. With jazz there are
no rules, that's the whole beauty
J M ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ M of the music. It's a style that has
more live input into the recorded material.
Nowadays with the technology in dance music
you can play backing tracks off pre-recorded
DATs and mix sounds off a machine over
them. Why do you feel you need to get a real
drummer and throw out the backing tracks?
Charlie: It's basically my dislike of it because
I've seen it so many times. People paying
through the nose to see this. O K I know that
people will pay to g o and see a DJ but I think the
whole point of going to see live acts is that in
essence, it should be a show, and be the real
thing. I've been and seen people with a DAT and
mucking around on top of it on the desk and 1
find it offensive actually!
You own a record label called Second Skin.
Tell us about that.
Charlie: We're all partners in the label. It's
been established for about eighteen months
now and w e all have vested interests in it. W e
own the company, w e put out music on the
label and w e want to promote the product as
m u c h as possible.
With so many labels around nowadays, why
did you decide to start your own?
Charlie: Theoretically we could have taken it
to any label of that ilk but my personal experi-
ence of dealing with record labels is that they
take too much control of the situation. It's very
difficult. Sometimes you've set something d o w n
and you're following a direction and it's perfect
and the minute they turn and say, "you can't d o
this."
Wm no boundaries so that is why I
II think it slides into the dance
Hj world so well. With any style of
dance music y o u can interpret a
jazz m o o d into that style.
As a Dj I've noticed that you
incorporate many different
styles into your set Shuff. Why
is this?
Shuff: Normally I tend to build
1 from a sort of jazz-dance/big-beat
1 introduction for the first half-
hour, and then I like to g o into the
sort of jungle jazz sort of things
and then m o u l d in harder style
stuff to the middle of the set. But
basically I'm not very much into
playing one type of music.
I think for m e as a punter going to a club
there's nothing worse than a Dj playing one
style, even if he's mixing superbly. I'm not into
three hours of drilling music. After a while you
just want to climb up the walls! It's O K but the
DJs not taking y o u anywhere. This also makes
sense with the music w e make because if I was
a 100% jungle DJ then I wouldn't be playing half
of Kooba's music!
Do you see Djing as an art form?
Shuff: Last year I was in Belgium and I saw
Juan Atkins playing. I'd never seen him before
but I'd heard his records and heard he is an
amazing Dj. From about the second track in you
could see that this guy was electric! He was
basically playing with three decks, but in a way
that he was rewinding certain elements of tunes
and they just kept on c o m i n g back during the
set. It was amazing. Y o u could see how he was
injecting these little things back into his set. He
was using his decks as musical instruments, so
in that case, yes!
M a n y thanks to King Kooba (DJ Shuff +
Charlie) and also Emily, Klaus and Anton at Main
