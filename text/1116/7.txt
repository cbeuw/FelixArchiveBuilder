THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
S u m m e r
These bricks belong on page six.
They wouldn't fit, but are too
good to waste
S
ummer, it's for chilling out,
and not for vomiting, melting
rulers or staring at an oscillo-
scope.
I a m currently in danger of
dropping about four per cent of my
year mark. The basic reason for this
is that I have a piece of laboratory
work outstanding. I will not g o into
the whys and wherefores of the sit-
uation n o w (but if Dr. Payne is
reading, it involves a week of illness
plus m y grandmother back h o m e
not being very well. Honestly).
Thinking about this has made
me wonder whether the summer is
in fact a g o o d time to d o any work
at a l l . Furthermore, the nean-
derthals w h o , presumably back in
the Stone Age, decided, "Hey! I've
got a swell idea! Let's set all exams
in the summer! Country-wide!" are
never likely to have been M E N S A
candidates. In fact, they are likely
to have been amongst the most
brainless cretins that concatenation
of D N A has ever produced. Only
once previously (as far as I c a n
remember), in the case of a certain
M r . A d o l f Hitler, has s o m u c h
power been erroneously awarded
to such a gibbering bunch of thor-
oughly m a d and really quite crimi-
nally sadistic maniacs.
Doing m y lab work at this time
last year w a s a period of m y life
which I a m not terribly likely to con-
sider with any retrospective joy.
The misery of sitting around baking
hot soldering apparatus while the
sun inexorably increased the r o o m
temperature w a s , bluntly, a little
over the top. M a n y students found
themselves sneaking out of the
sweltering building, not to visit the
drinks machine downstairs, but
instead to stagger across campus
towards Chemistry in the hope of a
nice refreshing glass of liquid nitro-
gen and some dry ice biscuits. This
left m e behind, eyes aching, staring
pointlessly at the hallucinogenic
green oscilloscope screen a n d
attempting to fix the vertical hold
for the umpteenth time, while, to
my left, m y experiment slowly
overheated, grinned maliciously at
me, a n d exploded. I c a n still see
Lissajou's figures in my nightmares
to this day.
Whether the following is
backed by statistical evidence I
know not, but I a m a firm believer
that all the worst illness crops up in
the summer. With temperatures
rising, personal hygiene decreasing,
and lots of lovely rotting f o o d
about, the bacteria and viruses all
c o m e out to play, like the annoying
kids at the front of our house o n a
Saturday. A d d to this the problem
of all the lovely pollen floating
around, and hey presto! A recipe
for disaster is conceived.
Exam halls are o n e of t w o
things: either a) cold enough to
freeze your hands to the desk if y o u
are foolish enough to touch it or b)
hot enough to melt your ruler so
that it resembles o n e of those
W h a m chewy bars. This can lead to
the further problem that if y o u
absent-mindedly drop your p e n
into this molten mass of straight-
edge it will sink in and remain there
forever, a monument to the stupid-
ity of administration. N o t only this,
but the aforementioned medical
miseries are enough to put all but
the most career-minded people off
their work, the remainder becom-
ing all poetic a n d swapping their
blue shift theory and knowledge of
cloud chambers for blue sky theory,
filled with clouds of its o w n . Others
simply b e c o m e violently ill, a n d I
would not have liked to have been
the marker for the GCSE paper o n
which a friend of mine violently and
repeatedly threw up.
Exams in the summer? Insanity.
Go back, have another think, and
try again.
