T
his time of year is one of the
most exciting in the art scene
of London, for the contem-
porary dance fans amongst us.
There are s o m e major festivals
from M a y right into August.
The first of these festivals start-
ed at the end of April and has just
finished: it w a s called S p r i n g
Loaded. I w o n ' t extend myself o n
it. It is a showcase of s o m e of the
best companies across the world,
and also the best talent working in
Britain. The highlights were Javier
de Frutos's latest offering called
Crass, an exploration of love. A
man has to choose between his
female lover and this man w h o is
trying to attract him away from her.
Another interesting c o m p a n y ,
C A N D O C O from Canada was also
featured. This is a very interesting
company with seven dancers, three
of them in wheelchairs. The result
is strongly emotional and thought-
provoking. If y o u have a chance to
catch these people, go for it.
There is lots more c o m i n g up,
starting this week. The Turning
World festival at the Place Theatre
and the Royal Festival Hall, for a
start. This is a s h o w c a s e of
European c o m p a n i e s , this year
mainly concentrating o n Belgium
and Portugal. Four choreographers,
all based in Lisbon, are here with
their latest work. The best two are
Paulo Ribeiro on 2 2 n d and 23rd
M a y and Vera M o n t e r o on 17th
June. There are t w o must-see c o m -
panies from Belgium, Rosas o n
22nd M a y , ie tonight, and Les
Ballets C de la Bon 12th and 13th
June. Rosas is the creation of Anne
Teresa De Keersmaeker; her style is
very different and quite difficult to
relate to at times but, in the end,
immensely rewarding. Les Ballets C
de la B are Alain Platel's ideas. I
think that this guy is one of the
most brilliant choreographer-direc-
tors around. His ideas defy any-
one's imagination, and the results
are always so inventive, hilarious
and important. This year he's pre-
senting "lets op Bach", with nine
dancers and a chamber baroque
orchestra. H e is one of the rare
breed that manages to take dance
onto another level by mixing it with
other artforms.
Finally, for those of y o u w h o
will be here over the summer, the
Royal Festival Hall continues its
D a n c e a n d Performance p r o -
g r a m m e . Don't miss Trilok Gurtu,
the jazz percussionist w h o will be
playing from his brilliant n e w
album, o n the 25th July.
If y o u need anymore informa-
tion about any of these events,
c o m e into the office and ask Julia.
W a t c h this space from n o w o n if
y o u like c o n t e m p o r a r y d a n c e .
There will be lots of reviewing
going o n .

I
don't really know how to start
this review. Cleansed is one of
those plays that keep y o u
thinking for a long time. I have to
say it: this play is fantastic.
Let me explain the story a little.
The scene is set in an university,
although no details are really given
in the text. The beginning of the
play is a succession of extremely
strong scenes that actually make
one feel quite nauseous. That feel-
ing only lasts a couple of seconds,
however. The characters are all the
'undesirables' of our society,
looked after by Tinker, a "doctor"
w h o is more like a hardcore sadist,
inflicting the most degrading treat-
ment onto his patients. H e escapes
all this by going to see the local
stripper.
S o m e of the worst atrocities
are committed to the s o u n d of a
musical box. I'll let you imagine the
effect of that. The recurring theme,
especially between boyfriends Carl
and Rod, is trust or the lack of it.
Carl wants Rod to give him his ring
as a v o w of commitment, but ulti-
mately betrays him. All of these
people are trying to survive in these
awful conditions through love: this
gives rise to some very tender and
touching situations that beautifully
clash with the violence of their
daily lives. Grace starts teaching
Robin h o w to write in a lovely
scene of innocent love, which in
the e n d has disastrous conse-
quences.
The director, James M a c d o n a l d
(he also directed Sarah Kane's
debut play Blasted) does mar-
velous w o r k using s o m e great
images to represent the violence.
Together with the designer, they
have created everyday settings
with a particular context, but that
could be transposed anywhere. It is
all extremely clever and gives the
play that a d d e d impact. The text
itself is very elliptic with not a sin-
gle w o r d is wasted, making for a
sense of concentration and impor-
tance. The actors have a very
strong role in their physical pres-
ence, talking as little as possible,
and letting expressions and move-
ments d o the rest. A n d this totally
works.
Morally speaking, Cleansed is
hard to watch. O n e does feel like
one is intruding o n something, but
isn't that an exciting feeling? The
play is a challenge to everyone; is
Sarah Kane just showing us a slight-
ly exaggerated view of our mirror
image to make us react? I will say it
again: this play is fantastic, one of
the landmarks of these past years
in the same vein as Trainspotting
a n d Shopping and Fucking. It
c o m e s as s o m e sort of revelation
a n d m a k e s t h e m e s like incest,
homosexuality and abuse s e e m
less distant. I urge everyone to go
and see it even if it sounds repul-
sive. It is a lesson in theatre and
can change quite a few things in
one's life....

hair beautifully set, with her sun-
glasses and side-long glances, of
the girls in La Dolce Vita, even think
of Audrey H e p b u r n in Breakfast at
Tiffany's, and y o u will have the
look.
It is worth going to see this film,
because it shows another slice of
life, one that will make you very
glad that this is not your family. It is
not an easy film, many of the ideas
are extremely disturbing. For non-
Italian speakers, it has subtitles, so
there is no excuse for not seeing it.
T
his film (Fists in the Pocket in
English) didn't disappoint me
in the slightest. It is a power-
ful drama about a completely dys-
functional family, with 3 epileptic
children, Giulia, L e o n a n d
Alessandro, a blind w i d o w e d m o t h -
er, and a y o u n g man, Augosto,
struggling to support his family
whilst trying to remain sane. Giulia
is jealous of her brother's ability to
attract love, and sends his fiancee,
Lucia, anonymous letters and hate
mail. She has an almost incestous
relationship with her brother
Alessandro which is always hinted
at, never described explicitly. The
s e c o n d brother, A l e s s a n d r o ,
decides to help his brother by mur-
dering the rest of his family, thus
enabling him to build up a better
life in the t o w n with his fiancee.
The story deals with the gradual
realisation of Ale's actions by his
sister and brother.
This is a harrowing and
poignant account of the collapse of
a family. Filmed in the sixties in
Italy in the hills above Rome, it has
recently been re-mastered, and is
being s h o w n at the ICA later this
m o n t h . The director, M a r c o
Bellocchio, is Italian and this was
his debut film. W h e n it was first
released, this film caused contro-
versy over its portrayal of a collaps-
ing family unit, in particular over
the blind and therefore helpless
mother. In Italy at that time, the
family was seen as integral to the
fabric of Italian society, with the
mother as a central M a d o n n a -
esque figure, holding the reins of
power in her calm and efficient
hands. This film can be regarded as
an example of the late neo-realism
school of film-making, with profes-
sional actors used instead of a m a -
teurs due to its content, and graph-
ic portrayal of collapse. As in many
Italian neo-realism films, it can't
have a happy ending.
The acting, direction and cine-
matography are all flawless and,
despite the film being in Italian, it is
an enjoyable experience. The
actresses are all extremely beauti-
ful, classy-looking Italian brunettes,
elegantly dressed. Think of Sophia
Loren in any of her films, brown
