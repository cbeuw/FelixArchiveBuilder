Microsoft in the Dock
MARK BAKER
Microsoft, the world's most successful soft-
ware company, faces a new threat this week.
The US Department of Justice (DO)) and twen-
ty US states have filed a lawsuit against Bill
Gates' all-powerful company.
Microsoft is charged with engaging in anti-
competitive and exclusionary practices designed
to maintain its monopoly in personal computer
operating systems and to extend that monopoly
to Internet browsing software. Essentially, the
DOJ is seeking to stop Microsoft from integrating
Internet Explorer (its Internet browser) into
Windows 98, a minor upgrade to its all-pervad-
ing PC operating system. It argues that users are
unlikely to install a different browser, and this
would effectively ensure Microsoft's domination
of the Internet browser market, as almost all PCs
run a version of Windows. "This action will pro-
tect innovation by ensuring that anyone w h o
develops a software program will have a fair
opportunity to compete in the marketplace,"
said Joel Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in
charge of the DOJ's Antitrust Division.
Support for the lawsuit has c o m e from an
unlikely source - President Bill Clinton, speaking
on Tuesday after meeting EU leaders, said: "This
is not just an open-and-shut case where one
party sues somebody else ... This is something
that will have a significant impact on our econo-
my." The Clinton administration is keen to see
competition flourish as the g r o w t h of the
Internet creates a vast new market. M o r e than
100 million people are now connected to the
Net with the figure expected to increase to a bil-
lion by 2005. E-business is expected to grow
nearly a hundredfold over a five-year period and
traffic over the Internet is now said to be dou-
bling every 100 days.
Bill Gates learns the strength of his
detractors' feelings as a conference last year.
In a typically hostile and bullish response,
Microsoft hit back at their accusers, stating that
the lawsuits "are without merit and could set a
harmful precedent in which government inter-
vention in a healthy, competitive and innovative
industry would adversely affect consumers and
the ability of U.S. companies to continually
improve their products." In an o p e n letter to cus-
tomers, Bill Gates said that the requested
changes to W i n d o w s 98 "appear to benefit a sin-
gle competitor at the expense of consumers".
M i c r o s o f t also stated that the release of
W i n d o w s 9 8 was "on schedule" to reach con-
sumers on June 25.
However, most industry observers remain
unconvinced of Microsoft's lofty principles - in
M a r c h 1997 an internal m e m o concluded "if w e
take away IE from the O/S, most nav users will
never switch to us."
Should Microsoft lose the case, the US gov-
ernment could break up the 'supercompany' or
regulate its business practices. Given the impor-
tance of M i c r o s o f t in the U S e c o n o m y (it
employs nearly 25,000 staff), the latter option is
more likely. Microsoft would most likely be
forced to include less "free" software with its
operating system, instead selling the packages
individually. It would also have to put a stop to
its practice of pressurising PC manufacturers to
include W i n d o w s and Internet Explorer on every
machine sold. (When C o m p a q decided to bun-
dle Netscape Navigator, Microsoft threatened to
rescind Compaq's license to install W i n d o w s o n
its desktop PCs).
As news of the titanic legal battle was
released, shares in Microsoft have d r o p p e d from
$89 to $86. Bill Gates won't be losing sleep yet
though - at this price his c o m p a n y is still worth
over $200 billion.
