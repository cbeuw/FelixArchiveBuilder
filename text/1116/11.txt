PURPOSE MAKER - JEFF MILLS (REACT RECORDS)
Release Date: Tuesday 26/05/98
]
' eff Mills is adored worldwide by techno kids.
His fast and furious DJing has w o w e d crowds
on all corners of the globe. H e also releases
usic (the majority of his DJing material is his
own records) under t w o labels, Axis a n d
Purpose Maker. H e claims that the material on
Axis signifies music for the m i n d , and the output
on Purpose M a k e r corresponds to the mechani-
cal parts of the body; for example the hands
which are the main DJing tools!
Jeff's back catalogue is mostly o n a vinyl-
only format, so it was a great relief to non-DJ
dance fans w h e n React Records decided to
license and release the highlights of each label.
The Axis compilation is already out (entitled The
Other Day). Next week sees the release of
Purpose Maker. Both albums follow o n from the
now-classic Live At The Liquid Rooms C D which
gave many the chance to sample Jeff's unique
three deck DJing abilities.
The album begins with The Dancer, a funky
hybrid of techno meets folk music (that's hon-
estly the best way I can describe it). This has a
very bumpy jumpy sound and is suitable as pure
techno but is not so clean or minimal as the
norm.
Casa is the next track and is actually lifted
from the Axis label, but an EP which was called
Purpose Maker and marked the begin of this
series. This track features hypnotic rhythms that
are not quite fluid but won't let you escape once
you're in the groove!
The Bells is one of Jeff's hardest offerings
since his early work on pioneering Detroit label
Underground Resistance. W h e n he played this
at the End last year it left everybody gasping.
Reverting is the second track to be lifted
from the Axis Purpose Maker EP. M a n y regard
that record to be Jeff's finest work to date.
Reverting contains more funky looped rhythms.
A sort of xylophone sound c o m e s in midway and
the effect is electrifying!
M y personal favourite track is Alarms. A very
simple track, this consists of a l o o p e d sample
over a very funky beat. This works as house or
techno and has an infectious groove.
There are s o m e slower and deeper tracks on
this compilation. Check out Medicine Man for
one example of such a track. It is one of a group
of unreleased tracks on the album. So you can
even be one up on the vinyl DJs by owning this!
The tribal nature of s o m e of the Purpose
Maker releases is also apparent here. Check out
Paradise, a more dirty sounding track with a
shuffling rhythm and heavy bass. Masterplan is
almost completely percussive. The rhythms are
led and cut up by fierce stabs of breakbeats. This
is hard and dark and dangerous!
The Purpose M a k e r compilation is not music
to be messed with, and may be lost on many
people, but there is no denying it will please all
his fans and anyone w h o is curious enough to
want to check out the psyche of this m o d e m
day musical hero.
