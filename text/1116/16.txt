RENT
The Shaftesbury Theatre
TRAINSPOTTING
The Man in the Moon
T
his musical is absolutely
amazing, get d o w n to the
Shaftesbury Theatre and see
it now!
Set in d o w n t o w n Manhattan,
Rent follows a year in the lives of a
g r o u p of y o u n g p e o p l e , all of
w h o m suffer from at least one of
the usual modern day 'afflictions' -
heroin addiction, homelessness,
HIV and tranvesitism amongst oth-
ers. (For more trainspotter facts,
see below - Arts Ed.)
Mark, the character through
whose eyes we see the events of
the play, is making a video chroni-
cling the day to day existences of
his friends over Christmas and the
ensuing year. W e see death,
romance, rioting, deception and a
distinctly surreal 'cow' sequence in
which the audience was invited to
m o o profusely.
First, y o u will notice the music -
it is brilliant. The songs are gen-
uinely e m o t i v e in all the right
places and are generally outstand-
ing. Without exception they were
catchy, up to date and c o m p l e -
mented the plot well - y o u will not
find A n d r e w Lloyd-Webber style
ballads in Rent. Each one stands
out as a song in its o w n right, and
you'll want to go out and buy t h e m .
C o n s i d e r i n g the gravity of
issues dealt with, we couldn't help
feeling that perhaps the m o o d was
at times slightly too upbeat, but as
a whole, the play portrayed typical-
ly depressing topics in a sensitive
manner and managed to include a
hefty serving of feelgood factor.
The suffering of the characters was
s k i m m e d over perhaps a little
which admittedly made for g o o d
entertainment, although not an in-
depth reflection o n contemporary
society. But w h o wants that from a
musical anyway? Rent has just the
right balance - it put us in the pic-
ture without dwelling o n and
exploiting the problems of the
characters.
The cast was excellent with
very powerful and enigmatic per-
formances from all, especially M i m i
(a nightclub dancer) and Angel (a
gay transvestite - very PC). (No,
very Candy Darling - Trainspotter
Arts Ed). Everyone in the C o m p a n y
was obviously enjoying themselves
and putting a great deal of effort
and energy into the singing and
dancing. This came across strongly
and enabled us to easily empathise
with the characters, which were all
well-defined. They portrayed the
humorous and witty scenes very
cleverly, especially in the tele-
phone/ansaphone sessions with
the outside world. These scenes
helped to put the play into context
and emphasised its trueness to life.
The costumes were also of a
very high standard - y o u could
imagine seeing p e o p l e wearing
them in the streets, yet they were
not boring or dull and had a striking
impact that accompanies the 'any-
thing goes' attitude in N e w York.
The whole virtue of Rent, in fact, is
that it is a genuinely streetwise and
believable musical that lacks pre-
tentiousness and, quite frankly,
corn.
Judith and Christian
Y
ou've seen the film, you've
bought at least one of the
CD's, some of the poster col-
lection and you've probably even
got the t-shirt. Have you read the
book, or seen the play? W h y not?
"Because its probably a bunch of
arty shirt-lifters over-pronouncing
s o m e unheard-of geezers' ram-
bling adaptation". Until last Friday
night I'd have probably agreed: I've
seen Shakespeare in the Theatre
and o n the silver screen and its
better on the screen - if he'd been
alive today the Bard would have
been a screenwriter. M i n d y o u - if
he was alive today, he might well
be Irvine Welsh and Harry Gibson
rather than the C o e n brothers.
There is very little theatre which
is worth seeing these days, but that
which is, really is worth seeing.
Trainspotting (the Play) is one of
those w h i c h , like Ben Elton's
Popcorn, c o m e s to life o n the stage
- especially one as small as the
M a n in the M o o n , Chelsea (just
'round the corner from Vivienne's,
darling!). It's a m o o d y , violent,
frightening beast, with the tortured
soul of the disenchanted, gobbing
and knifing its way through the
audience, whirling a Snooker cue
and shouting at y o u . G o and see it
- let d o w n your defences and actu-
ally allow something to affect y o u ,
for once. W o n d e r at how they
manage to actually shoot up on
stage, three feet from y o u . Feel
what it would be like to be the low-
est person in the world, slowly
killing yourself on junk. Ask yourself
whether suicide, wouldn't surely be
better than the ups and downs of a
smack habit. There's no overall
political c o m m e n t - yet the politics
is startling in its crude truthfulness.
It's not about Generation X, or
even chemical culture, it's about
those w h o don't even care what
society is - as Renton himself
admits; "Due tae this failure tae
recognise societal reward, success
(and failure) can only ever be fleet-
ing experiences for me their
value can never be sustained
because there's nae recognition ay
the society w h i c h values
them ah dinnae gie a fuck."
In the film, we're allowed to
hope that things work out all right
for Renton at least. In the book,
we suspect that he's going to d o it
all again, just in a different country,
but at least he gets a chance. In the
play, we're given no such luxury -
Renton is as bad as Begbie, as he
surely must have been all along.
He just destroys himself with hero-
in rather than in psychotic heroism.
At least the Beggar is delusional -
at least he has a reason to hate the
world. The Rent Boy just cannot be
bothered - life's d o n e h i m no
favours, so he's not even going to
try - take what's c o m i n g and hunt
for the next hit. The only small
problem 1 have with Gibson's adap-
tation was its omission of one of
the best lines from the book; 'You
just want tae fuck up on drugs so
that everyone'll think how deep and
fucking c o m p l e x y o u are. It's
pathetic and fucking boring." W e
probably all know someone like
this, and the deepest irony is that
they tend to be the ones w h o rave
about the film the most.
Stephen Starkie
T
his is the long-awaited adap-
tation of Puccini's classic, La
Boheme. Taking the under-
belly of 1800s Paris a n d translating
it to the fin de siecle N e w York, was
the life's work of one m a n ,
Jonathan Larson. This musical has
taken Broadway by storm, with
many members of the audience
going back time and again. With its
student friendly price-tag, Â£ 10, and
its extremely cool and streetwise
look, this musical embodies the
soul of N e w York, of the people
Lou Reed sang about in Walk on
the Wild Side. You'll find Candy
Darling, S u g a r - P l u m Fairy a n d
Holly, w h o c a m e from M i a m i FLA
and hitch-hiked her way across the
USA, renamed, but recognisable.
A n o t h e r influence is obviously
Stephen Sondheim (he helped with
the drafts) and the musical is remi-
nescent of West Side Story, with-
out ever being derivative. Another
familiar face is the girl from the
Tamperer song, Krysten M a r q u e z ,
she's playing M i m i M a r q u e z , and
anyone w h o listens to the radio will
know that she has an amazingly
powerful voice.
This musical has broken all the
records in America. The audience
sizes have been unprecedented,
and approval in N e w York has been
almost universal. This is a s h o w for
y o u n g people, and as such it has
been extremely successful in luring
people w h o normally w o u l d n ' t
have gone to Broadway - they
haven't had an empty seat in two
years. Perhaps this musical won't
d o as well in this country, where we
are more familiar with the seedy
side of life through plays such as
Cleansed a n d Shopping and
Fucking, films such as
Trainspotting, and TV programmes
such as This Life. 1 can only hope it
will, because apart from Chicago, it
is the best musical to c o m e off
Broadway since Guys and Dolls.
It s h o u l d be noted that
Jonathan Larson s u c c u m b e d to
AIDS, literally days before the show
o p e n e d in 1996. In performing this
monument to his life, we are pre-
serving his memory, and making
him immortal. A little hyperbole
never hurt anyone.
