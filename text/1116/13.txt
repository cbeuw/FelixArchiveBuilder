22 May 1998 IC RADIO 13 V
YOU'RE READING IC RADIO (!!)
A
ssaulting veteran radio 1 presenters is
not usually considered a g o o d career
move for up and c o m i n g bands. Luckily it
doesn't see m to matter any more for I a m 7, I
don't know h o w they felt about it then but n o w
the sniggers are not withheld as Jai recounts the
story involving, as it does, a pub, a pool ball, and
the balding pate of o n e Steve Lamaq. While
stunts like this are not unusual for the boys (at
the last g i g while fully fueled o n a bottle of
brandy jai inadvertently kicked a pint of beer all
over trendy Brit, -artist M a r k Whallenger) they
are not unduly worried, and there's a reason for
this. They are currently recording a d e m o with
Monti from Curve and have record labels queu-
ing up for them, a n d not the shitty little ones
either. 1 a m 7 are Jai Stokes. M a t t Russel, a n d
Ian Faragher and they c a m e d o w n to see us last
Thursday to record a session in our Northside
studios. The session bore fruit in the form of
four tracks, t w o of which y o u m a y have heard
them play live that very evening, and y o u will be
able to here the others exclusively o n John's
show next Thursday lunchtime between 12 and
2. I a m 7 write tunes to die for don't miss it!

O K here's a quick run d o w n of this term's
schedule. Variety is essential; indie, gold, drum
and bass, R&B, spoken w o r d and jazz; we've got
' e m all. So whatever your musical bent w e cater
for y o u . W e broadcast at lunchtimes from 12-2
and if y o u want your essential c h o o n played,
give us a call o n 5 8 0 8 5 . Before your Friday night
excursions from reality, tune into our live all
night dance mix from experienced Dj's w h o ' v e
played over twenty L o n d o n clubs between
them.
N e w for W e d n e s d a y night are Peter Terry
and DJ Pugwash: EVERY w e e k betweeen 6 and 8
where they give away free cinema tickets to
Warner Village for whatever film y o u want. If y o u
know what y o u like, you'll like IC Radio.
Remember also that your favorite radio Dj's
play in the new and improved Southside Disco
which, for the purpose of cool, will n o w be
known as T H E BACK R O O M . So if you're in
southside bar o n thursday or friday nights a n d
want to retract into a less busy, more chilled out
atmosphere then stroll o n d o w n , past the bogs,
through a slightly dodgy corridor until y o u reach
the unmissable lilack blue walls wich surround
this impressive venue.
