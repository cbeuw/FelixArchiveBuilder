"We serve beer in proper glasses!
We serve beer in proper glasses!"
"Our girls are better looking! Our
girls are better looking!"
"What's it like to, what's it like to,
what's it like to serve crap beer?"
Whatever else may be said about
Southside's male footballers, they
were certainly in g o o d voice during
the girls' five-a-side m a t c h .
Banners emblazoned "Scrubbers",
"Peasants" and "Union Scum" were
produced and w a v e d angrily at
their counterparts on the opposite
touchline. They would have their
say later.
The match itself was a largely
one sided affair. The Union Staff's
girls broke forward in the first
minute allowing A m y Seal to score,
and remained solidly c a m p e d in the
Southside half. O n the rare occa-
sion that the ball found its way into
the Union's half, the Union selec-
tion policy of picking girls o n their
ability to run and quite often kick
rather than their appearance in
tight shorts s e e m e d increasingly
wise. Thanks to some fine goal-
keeping and downright hilarious
refereeing from baldy Southside
regular Martin Ramsey, the Prince's
Gardens m o b kept the game at 1 -
0, almost sneaking the draw in the
dying seconds, but the result was
never in serious doubt.
The real business of the day
was about to begin. Southside's
central defence hadn't turned up.
Their captain went round pleading
with his team mates to put out
their cigarettes. The Union looked
as if they might have been practis-
ing. It all started looking a little
ominous. N o n e of the Union play-
ers were wearing sunglasses, and
the possibility that they were taking
the whole thing seriously started
becoming horribly real.
A goal from the first attack set
the tone for the match. A mis-hit
shot from the U n i o n ' s Dave
Wharton went sideways from six
yards, stranding the already c o m -
mitted goalkeeper allowing Ian
Richards to tap into the unguarded
net from close range. He scored
again soon after; a right wing cross
found him unmarked on the back
post, and his low volley left
Southside's keeper, Felix's o w n
Jonathan Trout, with little chance.
Neil Eady got the third five
minutes before half time; the ball
forced over the line from under a
foot after a near post corner was
not cleared. Southside m o u n t e d
several attacks of their o w n , most-
ly through midfielder Nick Helliwell
and winger Alan Ross, but the final
ball to the front two was never
quite up to scratch.
A tactical switch at half time by
Southside evened the g a m e up
thoroughly, with Charlie Cunnell
bringing steel to the central
defence a n d M i k e P e a c h m e n t
bringing some lovely bruises to the
legs of the Union's right winger. A s
tiredness set in, both sides started
making chances, but solid goal-
keeping at both ends denied any
addition to the score until ten min-
utes from full time, where an unfor-
tunately deflected clearance fell to
the feet of the Union captain Gerry
Donahoe, w h o turned and blasted
home from six yards unchallenged,
despite justifiable claims of offside
from the Southside defence. The
Southsiders almost scored a last
minute consolation goal after a
lengthy goalmouth scramble involv-
ing late arrival Gareth Parry, fresh
from a mere 4 8 hour stag party in
Edinburgh, but were denied once
more by the safe hands of Seb
Norager.
James "Ref" Vallance blew the
final whistle to signify a comfort-
able four goal victory, and the
t e a m s t r u d g e d off to Prince's
Gardens for post match gloating,
boat racing (Southside 2 - 0 Union),
singing, beer fights and an unfortu-
nate incident with the barbecue
and a H o o c h bottle full of petrol.
O h , and the Southside girls were
better looking.
A Nice Cup
IC CRICKET II v ST
GEORGE'S II
It was a surreal scene amidst the
debris in Beit quad at n o o n on
Sunday, no hail, no rain, not even
any wind and a full c o m p l e m e n t of
players. In fact w e were so sur-
prised to have eleven m e n that we
left Andy behind. Instead of doing
the sensible thing and awaiting our
return in the bar he ran behind the
minibus for a g o o d 15 minutes,
while w e s c o u r e d the S o u t h
Kensington streets. Nice to see a
bit of desire to play though.
U p o n arrival we were greeted
by the opposition informing us that
they had been bowled out for 21 in
their last match. This was treated
as sneaky gamesmanship, after all
their firsts had lost only narrowly to
IC firsts in the U L U cup final last
season. The captain w o n the toss
and put them in, electing to o p e n
the bowling with a leg spinner.
They hadn't been joking, w e
bowled them out for 10, even after
the o p e n i n g bowlers had been
taken off. Three wickets apiece for
Nim, Alex and JP. 101! Even M i k e
of Tea
Atherton averaged more than that
in the West Indies!
Our batting was less imposing,
but so was their bowling and we
s o o n rattled up 101-9 declared,
most of the runs c o m i n g from
G o p i . Then they had another go
and this time got 47 against our
part time bowlers. Rushi took a
fantastic five wickets and IC sec-
onds had a famous victory made all
the m o r e unbelievable by the
superb weather and the fact that
for the first time in living memory
IC didn't drop any catches.
The opposition were a great
bunch of blokes and their teas were
fantastic, ice creams, what luxury.
W e are therefore going to have
another match, but this time with
mixed teams, if IC can find half a
d o z e n girls. N o experience, or skill
necessary, because George's don't
have any. If there is anybody inter-
ested please e-mail Peter
(p.franke@ic.ac.uk), or Andi (a.fer-
guson@ic.ac.uk).
10 runs, fancy a cricket team
getting a football score!
SHOOTERS TAKE
THE CUP
After the Materials department
scored 24/24 for teaching quality a
final year student proves they real-
ly are the best by winning the West
Kent Rifle League Presidents C u p .
Jon M c Cartney beat over 50 other
rifle shooters to take the cup with
his best ever performance by far.
Mark Carter came a creditable 4
and some g o o d scores were put in
by the other shooters from IC with
our top lady, Neela Das gaining her
first ever standards medal.
Jon refused to be interviewed
by "Felix" having signed a deal with
"Channel O n e N e w s " said to be
worth as much as Â£5 for his exclu-
sive story. However, he will be
parading around the campus in an
open t o p p e d bus showing off his
cup just as soon as he gets it back
from the pawnbrokers. It can be
reported that none of the IC
shooters failed the m a n d a t o r y
drugs test and even Jake Thome
had more drugs than the m i n i m u m
specified amount. All that training
in Southside o n a diet of Caffreys
and pork scratchings really has
paid off this year with two cups
and a dozen standards medals to
Imperial College Rifle and Pistol
Club's credit.
