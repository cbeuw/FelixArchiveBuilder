Editorial
Every week, w e find that w e have
several news stories lined up that,
on closer investigation, evaporate
(usually at the last minute). O n e
such story this week w a s the
Clayponds Village Hall Project.
Clayponds is a large housing
estate in South Ealing that w a s
bought by the college part-way
through construction for use as
student flats and houses. Fine s o
far. W h e n completing the project,
it would be fair to say that corners
were cut, and while they are gener-
ally pleasant enough, the majority
of the dwellings were left without
any communal space.
Neither w a s there any social
space o n the estate, so life at
Clayponds is, by admission of all
w h o live there, very dull.
Years ago, some bright spark
suggested building a 'village hall'
for the estate - basically a function
room and bar for use by all the res-
idents. General approval w a s
received, plans drawn u p , a n d
costings calculated. At this point,
something started to g o wrong.
Without ever running into difficul-
ties or receiving objection, the pro-
ject floundered in college bureau-
cracy.
Given this history, w e were very
pleased to hear from a union offi-
cer that the project has finally got
the go-ahead. Faced with the rare
prospect of reporting s o m e g o o d
news, w e investigated.
Yes, a decision h a d been
reached, but no-one really seemed
to know what is w a s . Yes, the
design office were d r a w i n g up
plans, but they couldn't give us a
start date. Yes, planning permis-
sion had to be obtained, but no,
there would not be any problems.
So why wasn't it happening?
S o m e h o w or other, this project
has been shoved into a mainte-
nance category. It is now languish-
ing at the bottom of a queue,
below the Garden Hall repairs, the
apparently impossible Montpelier
Hall refurbishment a n d even the
ongoing Evelyn Gardens work.
IC bureaucracy strikes again,
the the Clayponds Village Hall sinks
sadly into the m u d .
