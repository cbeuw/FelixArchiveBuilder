A
s the opening credits roll, the
tag "Oliver Stone pre-
sents..." flash across the
screen. The conspiracy meister has
marked out y o u n g director Stabile
as someone possessing the flair
worthy of a break in H o l l y w o o d ,
and has allowed his name to be
attached to the project, in return
for Stabile getting enough cash to
produce his first film. Sadly, h o w -
ever, Stone clearly isn't that p o p u -
lar in Hollywood at present, as his
illustrious n a m e only s e c u r e d
$5000 for Cravesend.
The resulting film s h o w s
glimpses of the talent that Stone
seems to have identified - particu-
larly the fast, n o n linear editing
which chops between actions a n d
their aftermath. H o w e v e r , the
whole thing is undermined by the
amazingly l o w budget. Shot o n
camcorder a n d o n the streets, the
realism is undeniable. Yet the grain-
iness and jerkiness of the picture is
light years behind what the cinema
going public have c o m e to expect.
The plot mixes elements of
Taking low budget to a whole new dimension.
Shallow Crave and Cridlock'd, as
four teenagers accidently kill some-
one, a n d then try to dispose of the
corpse. What results is a strange
mix of textbook gritty realism and
an absurd chain of events which
border o n farce.
Yet, despite all the merits of the
editing, writing and directing, the
cheapness of the production per-
vades every second. In principle,
there's nothing w r o n g with l o w
budget films, giving directors the
chance to shine, without falling
back o n millions of pounds worth
of CGI. But y o u can have t o o m u c h
of a g o o d thing....D

STAR PROFILE:
D A N
A Y K R O Y D
L
ike so many of his contem-
poraries, D a n Aykroyd first
c a m e t o p r o m i n e n c e o n
Saturday Night Live, the U S come-
dy s h o w that launched the careers
of Steve Martin, Billy Crystal, Bill
Murray and M i k e Myers, to name
but a few.
His first film projects came as
spin-offs of S N L sketches, with the
Blues Brothers the most notable.
As the cult around the film grew,
A y k r o y d b e c a m e a serious
H o l l y w o o d player. However, it was
the box office success that a c c o m -
panied Chostbusters, which he
wrote and starred in, alongside fel-
low SNL-ers Bill Murray and Ivan
Reitman, which set h i m u p as one
of the most valuable comedians of
the late eighties.
A string of similar projects fol-
l o w e d , a n d whilst all achieved
respectable box-office figures,
none achieved the glory, or endur-
ing popularity, of Chostbusters
(which spun off cartoons, phe-
nomenally successful merchandis-
ing, toys a n d an instantly recognis-
able theme tune).
M o r e recently, Aykroyd has
drifted between c o m e d y projects
of an increasingly lame standard
(Sgt Bilko and Coneheads spring to
mind) and s o m e very impressive
"straight" roles, including support-
ing roles in the critically acclaimed
Driving Miss Daisy and Sneakers.
Indeed, his last big screen appear-
ance came in Crosse Pointe Blank
(one of the best films of last year),
and whilst this is, in theory, a c o m -
edy, it is unlike anything he's ever
done before - a n d his best perfor-
mance for ten years or more.
