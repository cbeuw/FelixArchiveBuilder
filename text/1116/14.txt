|oe M o r t o n &. every blues musician you've ever heard of
22 May 1998
Twice as many Blues Brothers -
F
orget the title - this isn't a
sequel to the cult classic. It's a
homage. Although the charac-
ters are picked u p fifteen years
after the original, a n d set off o n a
new mission, this is more of a
remake than a sequel. A n d for that
simple reason, if y o u liked the orig-
inal, you'll love Blues Brothers
2000.
This time around it's Elwood
who is released from prison, a n d
decides to put the band back
together. Q u e u e series of absurd
car chases, musical set-pieces, a n d
cameos by every blues musician
you've ever heard of. Indeed, if
anything there are far more musical
numbers in 2000 than there were
in the original.
One of the principle reasons
why this has the feel of a remake is
the number of original cast m e m -
bers w h o return. If they're not
d e a d , then they're here. Thus,
although the late John Belushi
(Elwood's brother Jake in the origi-
nal) is sadly absent, Frank O z ,
Aretha Franklin, Kathleen Freeman
and James Brown all return. The
principle additions are therefore in
the form of the new Blues Brothers.
John G o o d m a n is Mighty M a c k
Blues, a bartender with a passion
for the blues, a n d a surprisingly
g o o d singing voice. M o r t o n is the
cop o n their tail, w h o ends u p
not necessarily twice as good.
singing in the band (don't ask how,
it's all a bit contrived), and Bonifant
is the obligatory annoying small
child.
However, it's Aykroyd w h o ' s
left to carry the movie this time
around, and thankfully, after a few
lean years only highlighted by
Crosse Pointe Blank, he's back on
form. H e sings a n d dances like it's
still 1980, a n d quite simply, he is
Elwood Blues.
Blues Brothers 2000 is a fans
dream, a n d anyone else's night-
mare. For example, the original was
famed for the biggest car-crashes
ever f i l m e d . This time r o u n d ,
Landis sets a new record, smashing
sixty cars in a scene which goes on
for so long that it actually becomes
boring. Similarly, for the fan the
final battle of the bands contest is
wondrous, as the Blues Brothers
Band g o head to head with the
Louisiana Gator Boys (Eric Clapton,
BB King, B o Diddley, Dr John, Lou
Rawls....). For the uninitiated, how-
ever, it could be t w o hours of tedi-
u m , particularly as there are very
few jokes for something which is
ostensibly a comedy,
Blues Brothers 2000 is the orig-
inal with a bigger budget. If you've
seen the original, expect more of
the same. If y o u haven't, then how
dare y o u call yourself a student?D

LIAR
Starring: Tim Roth, Chris Penn, M i c h a e l Rooker, Renee Zellweger
Director: Josh &. Jonas Pate it ir ir it
This man will seriously screw with your head.
A
t present, the caption " A film
by Josh cx Jonas Pate" proba-
bly doesn't mean anything to
you (it didn't to m e until I s a w this
film). Believe m e , very s o o n it will.
The identical twins are H o l l y w o o d ' s
next big thing, with the s a m e taut,
non-linear, style a n d reverence
toward A m e r i c a n c i n e m a that
marked out Tarantino's first t w o
films. Indeed, Liar is s o clearly the
film w e were all expecting Jackie
Brown to be - a tight, character dri-
ven piece, which oozes directorial
brilliance whilst screwing with your
mind.
The scenario is simple - as the
prime suspect in the murder of
prostitute Zellweger, rich-kid Roth
is forced to undergo a lie detector
test by cops Penn and Rooker. D a y
after day they continue the treat-
ments, but Roth resolutely refuses
to break d o w n . Yet at the s a m e
time his captors b e c o m e increas-
ingly convinced of his guilt. Roth,
however, starts to play g a m e s with
their minds, and slowly he turns the
finger of suspicion onto his t w o
tormentors.
Whilst it may sound like formu-
laic schtick, it's actually a supreme-
ly shocking and surprising piece of
noir. Although it may become obvi-
ous w h o did it early o n , there are
still many surprises to be had along
the way. Every character is morally
ambiguous, a n d every one is guilty
of something. Roth is an alcoholic
epileptic, giving o n e of his scariest
(and best) performances to date,
whilst Penn is plagued by a g a m -
bling addiction a n d b a d debts.
Rooker is by far the most terrifying,
however, as Roth slowly grinds
d o w n his exterior, and finally forces
him onto the lie detector himself.
Far more revealing than the
performances, however, is the skill
of the directorial d u o (who also
wrote the film). They manage to
maintain a high t e m p o and credibil-
ity throughout Liar, despite almost
the entire film consisting of three
m e n locked in a small dark room.
The suggested twists and revela-
tions of the storyline, together with
some brilliant set pieces - setting
up the lie-detector a n d Roth's
epileptic attacks in particular -
combine to give a glimpse of a
partnership w h o are o n the verge of
greatness.
Whilst the style and plotting are
first rate, the dialogue is in need of
s o m e work. W h e r e Tarantino
imbues his characters with person-
ality through the script, the Pate
twins fall back o n excellent perfor-
mances from their leads.
Although the style may not be
entirely original, a n d the dialogue
falls short of the standards set by
Tarantino himself, this is a fine
entry into the genre. Whilst the
twins may not become a great writ-
ing partnership, their future as a
directorial force w o u l d s e e m
assured. D
