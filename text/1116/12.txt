Underground All Around Town
1 have under taken a death defying mission to track down the people behind one of the leading pirate radio stations in London town
Upfront 99.3 FM. Risking life 'n' limb all in the name of journalism, I was taken blindfolded to a secret location somewhere south of the river
where I met up with the people behind the scenes. They kindly gave me the low-down on all things Pirate stylee.
Right! Here are s o m e of the facts a n d figures
about Upfront F M : They play a strict diet of only
the freshest u n d e r g r o u n d garage s o u n d s
around, with a touch of old skool / old house ' n '
garage thrown in and nothing else. They trans-
mit illegally on 99.3 F M seven days a week and
24 hours a day over Friday - Sunday. W i t h a
audience spanning right across L o n d o n t o w n
and the surrounding counties they .ire easily one
of the biggest pirates in the country. S o m e o n e
told me the other day that s o m e 3 6 5 , 0 0 0 peo-
ple live in Croydon alm.i ' h o w accurate this is 1
don't know), and this is only a small percentage
of the areas they cover. This gives y o u : s o m e
idea of potential audience available.
How did it ail start? (the names have been
changed to protect the innocent)
Mr X H o w did it start? A lot of fucking effort

Is there anything you want to say about the
licensing laws, would you go legal if you could
afford the license?
"•'Mr Y N o fii
even if we could. It's all about s c i e w i n g the sys
tern. It's all about the underground. If w e went
legal it w o u l d be like selling out.
Surely it's a lot of work. Why do you do
it? •
Mr Z W e do It for a c o u p l e of reasons
really. The love of the music — and it's as
m u c h about providing a service for the
community as anything, bringing the local
p e o p l e the m u s i c they want to hear.
Lveryone round here's locked into it.
How long has Upfront be running?
Mr X It's been g o i n g for lour or live
years n o w .
What differences are there between
Upfrors
Mr Z The main difference between us
and the other pirates is that w e started o u i
with no big name Djs at all, w e just built tt
up using b e d r o o m DJs from the start and
have continued; to use b e d r o o m D|s. The
only name D)s we have aie the ones that have
I can conlirm this because during the process
of these interviews they gave my main man Uj
Roast (a friend of mine) a weekly show every
Thursday evening midnight - 2pm. Now how
many pirates do you know would give a total-
ly unknown Dj (to them) a chance to play reg-
ularly on their station just on his mixing abil-
ity and me hassling em a little? Well let me
tell ya - not many. It's people like this that
are keepln' the scene alive.
How often do you get busted?
Mr Y About once a week at the m o m e n t , but
that's t o o as long as they keep it to that.
What do they take when they bust ya?
Mr X Well they have nevei busied us per-
sonally, thev haven t even found the studio.
They have only managed to get the transmitters

Where
you go and buy em from your local DIY shop?
Mi
ground by the Rig Doctor.
I bet the rig doctor loves the DTI!
Mr Y Yeah he does well alright out of e m .
Right now for who plays when. The Hit
Squad are their big 5 Djs that have all made
their names through Upfront and are now
blowing up all over London town and beyond.
They are: The Dexter (also of Flex Kru fame
respect to Redz & Pypee), jayDee, KCK, Para
& Risky and you can catch them on Upfront @
The Dexter Sat 2 - 4pm
jayDee Sat 4 - 6pm
KCK Thurs 8 - 10pm & Sat 6 -8pm
Para Wed 6 - 8pm &. Sun 4 - 6pm
Risky Wed 8 - 10pm & Sun 8 - 10pm
Some of the up & coming Djs playing reg-
ularly on Upfront are: Tommy Cockles, K-
Field, Darren James, Steve B and their latest
signing, the one and only Dj Roast who you
can catch for now, every Thursday from
Midnight - 2am alongside myself (although
I'm not playing). Beside the Djs they are also
neutering some of the freshest M C talent
around with the likes of M C Wicked, Asher,
Steppa D, Crazy D + many more.
These guys ain't nc
sketching it with d o d g y e
idea of what they are
station as a serious bus
knowledge of h o w the ra
Half the stuff they where I
technical just w e n t straigl
as explaining h o w they
j u n c h of cowboys
ipment and no real
'ing. They run this
ss with a in-depth
i equipment works,
ing m e w h e n w e got
over my head, such
3p the signal from
wandering and interfering with other stations.
it baffles m e why the DTI make such a big
deal over pirates as most d o n ' t affect anyone
adversely a n d the fairy tale that they interfere
with emergency broadcasts is getting very old
indeed,;
At this point I must big up the security /
technician w h o helped put us at ease w h e n DJ
Roast d i d his first s h o w a few weeks back and
cheers for the tea. A l s o to all the behind the
scenes technicians that keep everything running
nice ' n ' s m o o t h . I have to say I've seen a few
pirates in my time but never one so well set
up a n d run as this, these boys are running
things big time a n d the studio has to be the
tidiest and most comfortable I've ever
been in.
So if you're looking for the real s o u n d
:
of L o n d o n ' s underground Garage scene
Slfl forget Kiss, Radio O n e and all the other
pretenders and get locked on to the real
deal U P F R O N T 99.3 F M . Also these boys
aren't just risking a hefty fine and possible
lose of their freedom (ie Prison if they get
caught as the police and DTI, though I'm
sure they w o u l d jump at the chance to
I throw the book &. everything else they can
B R at em) they're also the more dangerous
^9 side of things (use your imagination).
So next time y o u tune into a pirate just
appreciate what these people g o through just to
bring y o u upfront a n d underground music.
Respect each and every time to all pirate crews.
Big up all Upfront massive, listeners, DJs and
M C s keeping it real L o n d o n stylee.
