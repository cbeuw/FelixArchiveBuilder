SEAN LENNON
Into The Sun
O
n 18th M a y , Sean Lennon
released Into The Sun. O n
the s a m e day, Julian
Lennon released Photograph Smile.
However fabricated this turn of
events may be, the outcome can be
g o o d for only one of the half-broth-
ers. By now, they are used to being
second best to their late father.
W h a t was his name, again? Jason?
Jack? Ringo? Anyway, it doesn't
matter. The point is that they are
both used to c o m i n g second best
to one Lennon. What's it going to
be like c o m i n g second best to a
second rate version of your dad?
Frivolous c o m p l e x constructing
aside, it does seem that the half-
brothers are destined to have c o m -
parisons made with their name-
sakes.
Julian's album has been pro-
m o t e d better over here in the U K
and Julian has been blessed/cursed
with almost the same voice as his
father. These factors will probably
result in a higher position for
Photograph Smile c o m e the album
charts. But while Julian may have
inherited the vocal chords, Sean
has had the greater fortune in
receiving his father's unwillingness
to be bounded musically. Into The
Sun is an exploration into different
musical territories tied together by
Sean's distinctive voice. At times,
his voice sounds a bit distant,
though. It's as if he is detaching
himself from his o w n lyrics, afraid
to really think too deeply about his
subject matter while performing it.
This is painfully clear on the melan-
cholic Wasted where the smoky,
after hours piano entangles itself
with the only lyric, "It's all but a
waste to be in love." Bittersweet is
not the w o r d . Well, actually it is,
but you know what I mean. Other
flash points are the p o p p y and
wonderfully reminiscent Breeze,
the jazz instrumental,
Photosynthesis a n d the wander
into Country territory that is Part
One of The Cowboy Trilogy, which
is surprisingly captivating. N o , seri-
ously, it is.
Sean has produced a diverse
collection of experimental yet still
accessible songs and deserves all
the success that he probably won't
get. Julian's album may sell a lot
more than Sean's but I think we
know w h o the best Lennon really is.
Or should that be was? d

SINGLES
Kenickie - / Would Fix You
You've probably heard this s o n g without know-
ing it, mainly because it doesn't sound like a
Kenickie song. Gone are the shouty bumfluff
songs like Punka. I Would Fix You shows a new-
found sense of (whisper it) maturity. That does-
n't mean this song is a tired dirge. In fact, it's
great. Perfect for this time of year with its " s u m -
mer's c o m i n g " vibe.
The Pecadiloes - Kirs ten's Bench
An indie song that walks d o w n the s a m e path as
The Eels, Kirsten's Beach shows promise for
their forthcoming album. Contains the wonder-
ful line "I a m running to my girlfriend, 'cos she
loves me for being w r o n g . "
Liberty 37 - Stuffed F..P.
Using the same growling guitar riff as every
heavy metal wannabe, these tracks fail to stick
in the brain. G o o d vocals, however, stop this
from being trash.
Super Furry Animals - Ice Hockey Hair E.P.
Exceptional song title. A n d the songs are even
better. This E.P. comprises tracks left over from
their Radiator album, which shows what a for-
midable songwriting talent the SFA's are. Ice
Hockey Hair is wonderful, containing everything
that any song could ever have: gripping intro,
haunting verses with the expected obscure
lyrics, propelling chorus akin to Pet Sounds,
sing-a-long repeated refrain a n d the usual
assortment of strange sounds. O h , and opening
track Smokin' is superb as well.
Mica Paris - Stay
Return of the early '90s soul diva. Her vocals are
as impressive as ever but the track suffers from
poor songwriting and predictable production.
Ultra Living - Homesick
O b v i o u s l y influenced by M a s s i v e Attack,
Homesick is a stunning vocal and musical per-
formance, tinged with the urban simplicity of
Arrested Development
Midget - The Day Of Your Life
As with previous single Invisible Balloon, the
pre-pubescent singer ruins an otherwise great
song, half Shed Seven, half Dodgy.
Ed
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
The Delagados - Pull the Wires from the Wall
Eighteen months ago The Delgados were just
another Scottish Pavement tribute band. They
just happened to o w n Chemikal Underground,
and so have been allowed the space to develop
into a truly beautiful prospect. Pull the Wires,
like their previous single, is dominated by the
sweet voice of E m m a Pollock whose sour lyrics
make for a gorgeous contrast. Mauron Chanson
is more standard fare, but still bounces along in
a way Bis will always be too annoying to really
pull off as effectively as this.
Crandaddy - Summer Here Kids
Frank Black must be kicking himself. Grandaddy
appropriate his nasal wail and surf-punk chorus-
es, and d o a much better job with them too. The
real g e m here is Levitz, though, which slow-
bums to a roaring Laptop conclusion after s o m e
particularly unhappy falsetto vocals. Get the
Quaaludes in and wallow.
Gold Blade - 16 Tons
M o r e soul-punk stuff from the self-proclaimed
saviours of Hard Bop. Sounds more like piss-
weak ska-revivalist bollocks to me.
Ultrasound - Stay Young
Like labelmates Suede, Ultrasound have got a
pretty g o o d line in h a m m y epics that have all
the requisite crashing guitars and overwrought
vocals. It's all well and g o o d , especially as I'm
occasionally partial to a bit of Wish You Were
Here-era floyd, but the chorus of " M y advice to
all y o u boys and all y o u girls is never try to be
old / I wanna stay y o u n g " is terribly patronising,
and smacks of the mid-life desperation of a
wannabe p o p star. Being y o u n g is shit. End of
story. N o w go and get a life.
Moloko - The Flipside
Leather pants so tight they had to be sprayed
on. Hips that swing with metronomic precision.
Enough beats to work up a little sweat. The
voice of a cat who's just s u p p e d the sweetest of
creams. O h G o d , I think I'm ready pass the
Kleenex, M o t h e r .
Barry Adamson - Can't Get Loose
As g o o d as anything on the class Oedipus
Scmoedipus LP. Essentially it's Nick Cave does
disco, the songs underpinned by an entertain-
ing, and usually very seedy, narrative. But the
way Barry swings into the chorus is pure Vegas
- the new Sinatra, anyone?
Urusei Yatsura - Slain by Elf
Worrying Tolkien theme fortunately restricted to
the title alone, Urusei Yatsura are still doing
Sonic Youth better than they ever did them-
selves, and are clearly having a (teenage) riot in
the process. Doesn't quite live up to the live
experience, but then w e can't have sweaty six-
teen year olds crowd-surfing in our bedrooms all
the time, can we? H Norm
