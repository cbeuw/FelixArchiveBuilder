Student Protestors
Depose President
JEREMY THOMSON
What started as a peaceful stu-
dent protest last week in Jakarta,
Indonesia has lead to widespread
demonstration, violence and
finally the resignation of
President Suharto after 32 years
in power. The leader of the world
fourth-largest country took the
d e c i s i o n stand d o w n yesterday
m o r n i n g a m i d increasingly ugly
scenes in the city and mounting
international pressure. In his brief
speech, Suharto also acted to dis-
solve the current cabinet a n d
immediately handed over power to
his vice-president, BJ Habibie.
The trouble began last Tuesday
when around 5 0 0 0 students from a
private college lead a demonstra-
tion to protest at delays in essential
reforms. Towards the end of the
day, a fight suddenly broke out and
the protesters were forced back
into the campus by the Riot Police.
Shots were then fired into the
building, killing six [Felix 1115].
Protests immediately began across
the capital, with an e s t i m a t e d
2 0 , 0 0 0 students o c c u p y i n g the
parliament building.
As the army took control of
much of Jakarta, looting and rioting
become widespread, leaving over
500 people dead. Worryingly, the
Chinese minority appeared to be a
target for racially-motivated
attacks, and most of Jakarta's
Chinatown now lies in ruin.
Amien Rais, the leader of an
Indonesian M u s l i m organisation
with 28 million m e m b e r s , has
emerged as the unofficial leader of
the opposition to the government.
He had planned a mass d e m o n -
stration in Jakarta's F r e e d o m
Square on Wednesday, but can-
celled after surveying the strength
of the military presence in the area
and ominous threats from army
generals.
Although Suharto's departure
has been warmly w e l c o m e d by pro-
testers, the newly installed leader,
Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, is seen
as 'more of the same' by many.
O n e of the few senior officials not
to have a military background he is
behind many of Indonesia's eco-
nomic and social reforms - not
always successfully. He is also a
close personal friend of Suharto,
and has been accused of 'crony-
ism'.
Aimen Rais has given only con-
ditional support to the new leader,
pressing for elections to be held as
soon as possible.
Spoof Holiday Leads Media Astray
ED SEXTON
A group of arts students who
claimed to have used sponsor-
ship money to finance a holiday
abroad have revealed that
the trip was a spoof.
The thirteen students, all
third years from Leeds
University, had collected
£ 1,800 from various sources
to put on an exhibition called
'Going Places'. O n arriving at
the exhibition this week,
tutors and critics were greet-
ed with a bowl of Sangria and
f l a m e n c o music, before
being led to Leeds-Bradford
airport, where they saw the
students apparently arriving
on a plane from Spain. The stu-
dents alleged that they had spent
the sponsorship on a holiday in the
Costa del Sol, justifying the trip as a
statement about the nature of art.
Their tutor, Terry Atkinson, defend-
ed the students in Tuesday's
Guardian, describing the group as
"very bright".
O n Wednesday, however, the
group revealed that the entire trip
had been fabricated, and claimed
One of the pictues used to dupe newspapers;
actually taken in Scarborough
that the media attention and e m o -
tion that had been generated was a
work of art. In The Independent
Terry Atkinson saw the affair as
"very successful in raising questions
about the nature of art." The stu-
dents have promised to repay the
sponsorship money, but this has
not pacified Leeds Student Union,
w h o gave the group a grant of over
£ 1 , 0 0 0 . Speaking to Felix Ruth
Wilkin, Communications Officer for
Leeds Student Union,
expressed her displeasure
at the incident, comment-
ing that the students
involved w o u l d be asked
"to explain themselves"
next week. She a d d e d that
the Union w o u l d "probably
be taking further action".
Although the students have
promised to return money
to all sponsors, M s Wilkin
m e n t i o n e d that many
groups were "really unhap-
py" with the situation. The
spoof was not part of the students'
course, but a voluntary exhibition
often put on (or not, in this case) at
this time of year by third year
artists.
