CONSENTING
ADULTS
Dear Sir,
I read with interest and concern
about the p r o p o s e d s m o k i n g ban in
college halls of residence and in
particular the attitude of those w h o
would push for such a ban. I d o not
smoke but d o like a drink and so
visit pubs where s m o k i n g is an
equally c o m m o n pursuit. I d o not
wish to see those w h o enjoy the
right to smoke have their rights
curtailed by those w h o think they
know better so I accept that I must
go home smelling of stale tobacco.
There is currently m u c h debate
about the number of people w h o
would otherwise live longer if it
wasn't for passive smoking. Since
the only e v i d e n c e is statistical
rather than clinical I think it is all a
storm in a teacup and smokers
should be left alone to d o what
they want in the privacy of their
own home, after all w e are all
adults and free to make our o w n
informed choices. The number of
unproven deaths f r o m passive
smoking in this country are about
equal to the number of deaths due
to medical negligence and mal-
practice, about 2 0 , 0 0 0 per year. It
makes y o u w o n d e r doesn't it?
Yours faithfully,

BEWARE IMPOSTER
Dear Felix,
You may r e m e m b e r m y
c o l u m n , 'The Idiot's G u i d e to
Getting a First1
, which appeared in
this esteemed journal last term.
Indeed, if y o u read it, y o u are prob-
ably in the process of passing all
your exams with flying colours right
now.
Anyway, as I was reading Felix
last week, I must say I was shocked
and appalled by what I read in the
'Electric Cafe'. I was just checking
out the latest phat selection of acid
greenhouse choons (or whatever
they call it these days), w h e n I was
devastated by the discovery that
s o m e i m p o s t o r has n i c k e d m y
pseudonym. In a blatant and cyni-
cal attempt to cash in o n my suc-
cess, a certain disc jockey, purport-
edly called Colin Dale, is releasing a
new album. (OK, so he might have
thought of it first and it might even
be his real name, but that's not
the point.) The album, 'Mutant:
Disco', is being released o n
Harmless Records. I must inform
the readership that this is most
definitely not a harmless record.
Being released at this time of year
means that thousands of students
will rush out and buy it immediate-
ly, thinking it to be packed full of
useful hints to get them through
their exams, having associated it
with m e . Instead, their concentra-
tion will be destroyed completely
by a brain-damaging cacophony of
'house and techno tracks' which
apparently have 'a disco influence'.
M y reputation will be irreversibly
d a m a g e d and I will lose all the
credibility and respect I have built
up over the years as a true pillar of
the College community. Do not
buy this album: the man is a dan-
gerous and opportunistic fraud.
Yours sincerely,
The REAL Colin Dale
(a.k.a James Clarke, Physics 3).
FREE MUSIC
Dear Jeremy,
I'd just like to take this oppor-
tunity to put in a blatant plug for
the Haldane M u s i c library. It's part
of the IC &. Science M u s e u m
Library, a n d any student can
borrow C D s and cassettes from it.
However, it quickly goes out of
date unless someone buys more
music for it. This year, that's us! So,
if there are any C D s you'd like to be
able to borrow - drop us a line at
mark.baker@usa.net. Hurry,
because we'll be going shopping
soon...
Yours,
M a r k Baker &. Chris Ince
