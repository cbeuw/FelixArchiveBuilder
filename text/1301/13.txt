Stan Stanley has already
made a huge impact on the
live comedy circuit due to his
effortless charm, razor sharp
timing and twisted outlook on
the world.
I had an opportunity to talk
to Stan in advance of his per-
formance at the Union, to find
out a little more about him
and the work that he’s cur-
rently doing.
Having asked Stan what it
was that made him decide to
become a stand-up comedian,
it was clear that from a young
age he had always been des-
tined to follow a career in
the comedy world. He claims
that his was a “classic clichéd
story”.
“I was always playing prac-
tical jokes as a child and get-
ting into trouble in school,” he
said. “I was never going to be
the type of person who could
hold down two jobs.”
He finally made the deci-
sion to move to London, and
he’s never looked back. Stan
is now the resident host at
the award-winning Amused
Moose Club. He was one of
only five acts invited to per-
form at this year’s Montreal
Just For Laughs Festival,
which he found “very stress-
ful but really satisfying”. That
was the biggest gig he’d had
up to that point, and it has
brought him further opportu-
nities to perform elsewhere.
Stan counts Rowan
Atkinson as his key inspira-
tional figure, as well as fellow
Brummie Frank Skinner “for
his slightly twisted humour”.
Stan says he feels that he’s
“not good at talking to peo-
ple” and so spending some
time in the toilet before gigs
is the best way he can pre-
pare and stay focused.
Stan hopes that his tour of
student unions will give him
an opportunity to try out his
new material, and he looks
forward to making an appear-
ance at Imperial.
Stan Stanley is truly a warm
and likeable Brummie and
his enjoyable line in mocking
humour should be popular
with the Imperial crowd.
