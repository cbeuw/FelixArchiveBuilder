Graduating and leaving university
is a big step for anyone – not only
finding a job, but choosing the right
one. As an Imperial graduate, there
are certainly more choices avail-
able, from working in industry to
working in the City, but very few
pursue their interests and try to
make a career of them.
I am doing just that. Without real-
ising it, I was building up my busi-
ness during university by develop-
ing my interest in photography. I
took photographs, wrote to readers’
galleries in photographic maga-
zines, and designed a website, www.
alexfineart.co.uk. The positive
feedback I received from people,
coupled with my own desire to do
something completely different, set
me a challenge to pursue a career
as a freelance photographer.
As soon as I had completed my
exams I was out taking photo-
graphs and building up my port-
folio. Initially I had broad photo-
graphic interests in order to get a
feel for which area appealed to me
the most. However, it is always at
the forefront of my mind that it is
best to be a master than a jack of
all trades. So, although I am still
at an early stage in my career, I
know I will be concentrating on
cityscapes and landscapes in the
coming months.
Now I have built up a reasonable
sized portfolio, it is important to
market the images to as wide an
audience as possible. I have discov-
ered that, although web-based mar-
keting can work well once you are
established, people initially want to
see your work before committing to
a purchase. So I pursued galleries
to exhibit my work. Fortunately,
I have been given my debut exhi-
bition Light, Direction, Reflection
at the Blyth Gallery at Imperial
College (level 5, Sherfield Building)
where I am exhibiting photographs
of London and Imperial. The three
themes symbolise decision-making:
initially you have an idea (light)
that you follow through by taking a
certain course of action (direction)
and finally you reflect on your deci-
sion (reflection).
All photographs in the light theme
are black and white, helping to
emphasise the contrast within each
photograph. Each image shows a
source of light, whether it be natu-
ral or manmade, to which your eyes
are drawn. The recognition of this
light should reflect the belief that
you have seen your idea. Having
had this idea, you choose to act on
it and decide on a course of action.
Direction symbolises the journey
we face in taking a decision, and the
names of the photographs in this
theme are meant to mirror some
of the processes we use in deciding
our course of action. Contemplation,
focus, the walkway and parallels
each describe a different aspect of
choosing and following through our
course of action. Once any decision
has been taken, it is within our
conscientious character to reflect
on our choice. The final theme,
reflection, explores reflection with-
in architectural photographs.
The black and white photographs
in light are more classical, whilst
both direction and reflection show
contemporary colour photographs,
many of which are of Imperial
College.
It has been a huge learning expe-
rience so far, planning and setting
up an exhibition. It can take weeks
to obtain the right photographs,
which must then be printed,
mounted, framed and hung in the
gallery. Alongside all of this, you
have to market yourself, approach
potential sponsors and advertise
the exhibition. I now understand
why most photographers spend
a month taking photographs, fol-
lowed by a month solely marketing
them. Although I have only start-
ed relatively recently, I have soon
found that making new contacts
frequently is essential: writing a
letter to someone could just spark
an invaluable opportunity. It is that
element of luck that I relish as a
freelancer.
