Schrödinger, Schumann
and psychology
Can a physics equation, a dead composer and Martin Cansdale explain the mysteries of reality?
Books books.felix@ic.ac.uk
This is a book about a quantum
physicist called John Ringer. It’s
also a book about the last days
of Schumann, an amnesic hospital
patient called Harry Dick, and the
winter in which Schrödinger dis-
covered his famous equation. Not
satisfied with all this, Mobius Dick
also considers reality, coincidence,
and causality.
In a nod towards one of the many
other works discussed in this book,
the four threads are carefully inter-
woven. At first, the subplots seem
like distractions, with no explanation
of why the next chapter is a seem-
ingly irrelevant tale of a nineteenth
century composer. As it becomes
apparent that the stories are linked,
the question of why they are there
is replaced by a delightful mystery
of what they mean. The interplay of
the plot strands is clever and effec-
tive. Rather than have a main story
with the others adding something to
it, each depends on the others in a
complicated symbiosis. The themes
of the book are introduced by Ringer,
disdained with cool scientific clarity,
and then picked up and enlarged by
other characters.
The main ‘Ringer’ plot concerns
thriller-like events at a research
station in the Scottish Highlands.
In spite of this, it has a medita-
tive feel given by Ringer’s frequent
reminiscences and philosophi-
cal daydreams. The tempo of the
book comes more from movement
between stories than from John
Ringer’s adventures.
The tones of the stories are cap-
tivatingly varied. Ringer interacts
with others, but the story barely
seems to leave his own train of
thought.Schrödingertalks,observes
and experiences more vividly, while
Harry’s amnesic confusion gives a
completely different confused and
superficial air to encounters with
his therapists.
According to a review of Crumey’s
last novel, Mr Mee, “the deadpan
humour never wavers.” The one
criticism I have of this book is
that I spent 100 pages wondering
whether it was meant to be funny.
The author seems to be making
sly digs at ‘unscientific’ modes of
thought, by putting idiotic remarks
and unfounded conclusions into
the mouths of artists and psycholo-
gists. Would a ‘writing therapist’
really tell a patient that she was
only working in a hospital because
there was no money in short story
writing? Would a psychologist, in
what seems to be the near future,
really jump straight from the name
‘Thomas Mann’ to phallic associa-
tions, or ask an amnesic patient to
guess what symptoms they might
have been showing before the acci-
dent which robbed them of their
memory? It’s not really clear if
these attacks are meant to amuse,
or are part of rather clumsily exe-
cuted caricatures. Fortunately, this
problem becomes less noticeable as
the stories progress.
John Ringer uses an analogy to
describe Schrödinger’s equation,
and how it relates to the real world.
He compares reality with a giant
book, containing all possible stories.
The appeal of Mobius Dick comes
from an inversion of this image.
Of the stories contained within the
book, which are ‘reality’? Are the
stories all ‘true’ in the framework
of the book, or is one somehow
more real than the others? Throw in
quantum mechanics with its prob-
abilities, wave-particle duality and
other common-sense defying con-
cepts, and you get a fascinating
novel.

Closet humour
There’s something strange in the neighbourhood. Who ya gonna call? A zookeeper, a sex therapist
and a lifestyle coordinator. Martin Smith, Books Editor, has all their numbers
Scott Spectrum is the slightly
nerdy brains behind the success-
ful television show Space Man In
Space. Space man flies his space-
ship around the galaxy and battles
space aliens in space. Nice and
straightforward, just like Scott’s
life. He has a beautiful wife and
a boss who loves him. However,
against all reason, Scott wakes up
one night to find a giraffe in his
wardrobe. Or rather, the ghost of
a dead giraffe. From here on in,
things start to get a bit weird.
The Giraffe, Jim, turns out to be
a profane, perverted, beer-swill-
ing apparition that seems intent on
saving Scott’s life in the style of A
Christmas Carol, with images from
his past, present, and future. The
key to this cunning plan seems to
rest mainly on Scott giving his wife
Continence “a good seeing to”. And
so the fun begins in one of the silliest
books I’ve read in quite a while.
Jim Giraffe is a bizarre romp
through the imagination of Daren
King, full of zany hairpin bends and,
above all, more sexual innuendo
than you can shake a large rubber
phallus at. The character of Jim
is inspired, and together with the
well-meaning but erotically clueless
Scott they make an a very odd but
extremely funny pair. Even more
bizarre things happen as any sense
of ground rules about what is physi-
cally possible are discarded. This
makes for a very entertaining read
that appealed to my twisted sense
of humour for at least the first third
of the book. However, as the story
continues, I think the imagination
became a bit too much for me: if
ever the writer seemed to back in
to a corner plot-wise, you could
tell that yet another ‘shifting of the
goal posts’ was about to occur. Like
Jim sprouting a pair of wings, for
instance. Then again, he is an imagi-
nary giraffe... or is he? Anything
could happen in a story like this, and
it often does.
Going to bed having read the
first half, I dreamt about the glow-
ing review that I was going to give
this book. It was witty, original and
readable. However, the final three
chapters utterly spoilt it for me: it
seemed as though the author had
got a bit bored with the story and
had just decided to end it. In short,
I recommend that you read and
thoroughly enjoy everything but
these three chapters, carefully tear
them from the back of the book and
burn them with a copy of the script
to the third Matrix film. That way
everyone’s happy. Then just write
your own ending. It shouldn’t be too
hard, just make something up. Then
again, maybe you’re one of those
people who likes Marmite, and you’ll
adore just how random Daren King
can be. Reading this has certainly
inspired me to get hold of Boxy on
Star, his first book.
