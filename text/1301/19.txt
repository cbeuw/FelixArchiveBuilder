CLUB REVIEW
Farringdon is a funny place at night
at the weekends. Around the time
of the last tube, the streets near
the station are awash with people.
Whilst the majority will be on their
way to giant superclub Fabric (see
Size Matters, right), a good propor-
tion will be heading to one of the
city’s oldest and most popular clubs,
Turnmills.
The club has a fair amount of his-
tory attached to it – it was the first
place in the UK to hold a 24 hour
entertainment licence, the birth-
place of gay hard house pioneering
club Trade, and it has been owned
by DJ Tall Paul (who also runs Duty
Free Records from there) for more
than 15 years.
Inside, the club is deceptively
large, vaguely L-shaped, with low
ceilings. On some nights, it can sup-
port up to four different rooms of
different music. Taking a wander
around, you’ll discover that there
are plenty of nooks and crannies to
lose yourself in. The décor is col-
ourful and abundant, with drapes,
old movie posters, strangely shaped
rails and nobbly divisions. There are
several seated areas, and it’s usu-
ally not too hard to find a place to
sit when you need a breather. The
sound systems are huge, and even if
they’re not the best around they are
punchy and do the job well.
Tonight I went to check out The
Gallery, Turnmills’ resident Friday
night. With a large base of mem-
bers, tons of regulars and a grand
reputation, it’s easy to see why this
is normally a rammed session, and
that’s without even mentioning the
line-ups. Which I’m about to do.
Paul Oakenfold played here the
previous week, Armin van Buuren
the week before that. This month
Fergie and Tall Paul are playing too,
so you can see this is a good place
to come to check out big names.
Tonight, those names were Timo
Maas and Dave Seaman, and by the
time I had arrived Timo was already
playing.
The self-styled German is a pro-
ducer as well as a DJ, and before he
made it big he used to sell mobile
phones. Once he got into the music
scene, he became one of the busi-
est men in the industry. Fans of
the music will remember his classic
proggy Ubik. He’s remixed many
big artists, including Kelis, Placebo,
Garbage and Fatboy Slim, and that
Azzido Da Bass track a couple of
years ago. The compilations Music
for the Maases, collections of remix-
es plus some of his own tracks,
have been successful accross two
volumes.
There’s only one way to describe
the was Timo Maas plays – wet
and hard. Driven by his desire to
make music away from the stand-
ard “cheesy shit”, he takes good
quality dance music and throws it
about to whip up a frenzy on the
dancefloor. His music is bouncy and
fun yet to the point and smart. He’s
not afraid to play popular or com-
mercial music either – he played
three Prodigy tracks. After a good
few hours on the dancefloor, getting
down to Timo’s blend of what some
people call ‘techno pop’, I came to
appreciate the air conditioning.
Whilst in some corners of the club
you might feel a bit of an icy blast,
when you’re in the thick of it you’ll
be grateful for the circulating air,
keeping sweat to a minimum.
Next up, it was the turn of progres-
sive DJ Dave Seaman on the decks.
A former DJM champion and past
editor of Mixmag, Seaman has been
around for a while. As well as break-
ing such prolific artists as Sasha,
Digweed and Full Intention via his
mate’s record label, Stress, he’s a
popular remixer and has a string
of successful mix CDs to his name,
including Global Underground and
Renaissance titles. All in all, this guy
really knows where it’s at in terms
of dance music.
His mixing is, as you’d expect,
superb. Heavy, harmonic basslines
and esoteric vocals and samples are
mixed together with great musical-
ity and dexterity. There was never
any question of the dancefloor not
being full; at times I find this place
a wee bit claustrophobic, getting
bumped around by too many shoul-
ders and elbows. For the most part,
though, this isn’t really an issue, so
long as you have the right attitude
and acknowledge that everyone is
there to dance. You’re going to be
squashed, people will push past you,
bits of bodies will poke into yours.
If you have personal space issues it
might get a tad wearing when that
sweaty monkey bumps your arse
on every beat of a snare. It’s just as
easy and a lot better to just shrug
it off though – be tactile, accept
that clubbing is a contact sport, and
become absorbed in the crowd.
It is a lot easier to tolerate a
packed dancefloor when a lot of your
fellow revellers are attractive mem-
bers of the opposite sex. Luckily,
in Turnmills, there’s no shortage.
The clientele are stylish and sexy,
and the way they dress matches
the decor (or possibly the other way
around). They’re friendly, up for it,
and not afraid to check out what
other talent is around. If you’re look-
ing for a place to go clubbing, with
proper, decent dance music, and a
chance of pulling too (which is sur-
prisingly easy – loud music means
no small talk), Turnmills is ideal.
Looking around the place through-
out the night, you’ll see plenty of
face sucking going on.
All in all, The Gallery is a consist-
ently good night out, well worth the
money, and with the possibility of a
lengthy queue if there’s a particu-
larly famous DJ on.

CLUB REVIEW
Here’s an unusual situation: myself
and my (male) housemate sitting in
the living room discussing what to
wear for the night out, while asking
our other (also male) housemate if
he’s got any clothes we can borrow.
Not something that happens every-
day, if ever. Had we had our brains
messed with by aliens? No. We were
going to Trash.
Usually I wouldn’t give a club with
a dress code a second glance, feel-
ing happily safe in the knowledge
that wearing trainers is going to
save me from whatever godfor-
saken trendy West End club I’m
being enticed to go to. But this is
different. It may be a dress code,
but it is comfortably without limits
or standards. Allow me to explain:
According to their website, Trash
want you to “make an effort”, with
absolutely no explanation as to
what that means. The first time I
ever went there I was turned away,
but this time I had help (we were
on the guest list) so we weren’t too
worried, opting in the end for the
usual festival t-shirt and a typical
indie stripped t-shirt.
Entering the club, there’s a dance
floor to the left with an award-win-
ning sound system that sounds
breathtaking. To the right is a bar
and a very nice chill-out area with
couches and tables. The founder of
The End, Mr C, did an excellent job
of making the venue enjoyable not
only to those who want to dance,
but also to those who just want to sit
in a corner somewhere and enjoy
the music. The headline DJ tonight
was called Annie, a Norwegian girl
who plays a very good mix of happy
electric pop. She wasn’t on for more
than an hour, being replaced by
resident DJs playing a wider vari-
ety of music, including the likes
of J5 and Dead Prez in the chill-
out room, and dance/techno mixes
on the dance floor. By now, the
place had started to pick up and the
dance floor was filled with happy
smiling people. If you’re still won-
dering about the dress code, most
people were dressed stereotypically
indie, with a few goths and punks
wandering about.
Trash is a very good night out and
highly recommended, even if you
do have to go through the hassle
of finding something to wear. The
crowd are nice, with all manner of
people and ages showing up. It’s
a great place to go if you want to
dance, or just be a wallflower and
enjoy the music.

Size
matters
London has some huge
venues. Here’s a quick
rundown of the giants.
Timo Maas
The Gallery
Turnmills, Clerkenwell Road
£12/ £15 after midnight/£10 members
HHHHI
Fabric, Charterhouse Street
Fabric is probably London’s only
true superclub. It’s five years old,
and in those five years has built
a reputation that means it regu-
larly fills itself – no mean feat with a
capacity of 3000.
With three rooms, it’s incredibly
easy to get lost in here, so make
sure you stay with your friends.
Fridays are FabricLive, often with a
live act appearing early in the night
in the main room. Usually there’s
drum and bass in the second room,
which means many many chavs.
Still, sometimes it’s fun to don a fake
Burberry cap and hoody and blend
in. Saturdays are Fabric, a more
housey affair, and Sundays host met-
rosexual DTPM. The best nights are
when Sasha makes the occasional
appearance.
seOne, Weston Street
seOne has long been renowned in
the underground dance scene as
one of the biggest and best places
to go for a dirty rave-up. Sited in
the tunnels under London Bridge
Station, its capacity is also around
3000. The most recent managment
have tidied it up a fair bit – it used
to be a car park in the week, a
rave venue at the weekends – with
proper floors and painted walls. The
best night held here is the quarterly
Raindance Indoor Rave Festival.
Brixton Academy, Stockwell
Road
This place is bloody huge. It’s a con-
verted theatre which holds about
4500 people. Voted best venue many
times over the past few years, when
this place hosts dance events there’s
not much to toouch it.
With a huge balcony, there are
some fantastic views to be had when
the place is packed with mental rav-
ers, resonating with bass and the
lasers going wild. The sound system
is probably one of the most power-
ful in London – stand in the sweet
spot between the speakers and the
bass will run right through you. The
Academy hosts all manner of dance
events, for example Hard House
Academy. I’d recommend anything
with very bassy music.
