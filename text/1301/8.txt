The first question you must
be asking yourself is what in
God’s name is a Rat Race?
Well, you get a few students
together, you make them run
around fearlessly and cause
havoc, and at the same time
you try to get them to an
unspecified destination. And
there you have it, London zoo
in your back yard. Kind of
like the movie Rat Race, but
instead of the million dollar
cash prize and a single des-
tination, we tweak the rules
and make them go to a dozen
places, giving away a few
things a little more affordable
to a students’ union.
At first we thought not
many people would turn up,
but in fact a few dozen came
along for a couple of hours of
mayhem. So, after getting the
teams registered and named,
we read them the rules.
But do freshers ever listen?
Absolutely not – it’s not in
their innocuous nature, and
who can blame them?
I have to say it’s quite excit-
ing when teams are ready
and waiting at the start line
(like at a marathon) and then
you throw them the first clue
but hold them down just to
annoy them, telling them that
they have to wait until the
word “go” (how exacerbat-
ing). Then all of a sudden, a
herd of rhinos are running
mad and wild inside Mech
Eng, screaming. Before real-
izing what was happening, I
couldn’t help but think of the
movie Jumanji.
Obviously, I’d warned them
that running through public
places wasn’t the best idea.
So what’s the first thing they
do? Run like mad through
Tanaka once the race starts,
pelting each other with water
balloons and water guns. Of
course this wasn’t outside as
you would have expected, but
inside the building around
anyone and everyone.
Naturally,Iplayeddumband
had a go at them, because the
security guards were waiting
at the door (they probably had
nothing better to do anyway).
After a bit of negotiation, I
blagged them out of trouble
while they ran off to catch
up with the other teams that
got away. Imagine Imperial
under attack from a bunch
of guerilla fighters swarming
through the College grounds,
and add a few laughs in
between unexpected water
balloon ambushes!
As one of the organisers
waiting at the various check
points, it was like watching a
slow motion of frenetic racers
making their way to the fin-
ishing line. It was also prob-
ably one of the funniest things
I’ve ever seen while standing
around South Ken.
I felt bad for the museum
staff when they saw students
with a bunch of water guns
running in and shouting in a
panic: “Where’s the Raphael
painting room?” or “Where
are the dinosaur fossils?” The
only thought going through
their mind was probably: “We
need emergency back up.”
Then it hit me: what if they
get arrested?
We started a water splash
out in front of the Science
Museum and in the College
walkway next to STA Travel,
and it seemed like almost eve-
ryone was wet for the most
part of the Rat Race. It was
great to see them all going
with the flow, and just letting
loose. The groups were get-
ting through the check points
pretty well, (with the aid of a
few carefully directed hints
from CGCU officers).
At the STA travel check
point on the Sherfield
Walkway, Helen, Caroline and
Rob waited patiently in their
traditional yet garish CGCU
blazers, making the check
point unmistakable. However,
the freshers took a while to
get there and we got bored
waiting. So we decided to
hide with our water guns and
launch a surprise attack from
behind, showering all the rac-
ers and a fair few passers by
as well.
All hell then broke lose once
the freshers realised they
could get extra points for hit-
ting people with water bombs.
Very soon, the walkway was
awash with water and crawl-
ing with security guards! Rob
sheepishly took most of the
blame while security gave us
all a “good ticking off” for
enhanced effect. The entire
conversation was caught on
camera by STOIC TV and it
went along the lines of:
Security Guard: “Which
department are you from?”
Rob: “Lots.”
Guard: “What are you
doing?”
Rob: “A Treasure hunt [tri-
umphant grin].”
Guard: “Who’s responsible
for the water guns?”
Rob: “Lots of people.”
And so, after Rob finished
giving the Security Guards
lots of inherently irrelevant
information, we made a run
for it, only to be caught again
on the other side of campus
– this time resulting in sev-
eral names being put down
for reference.
The funniest moment of all
had to be getting the fresh-
ers to do star jumps and
gymnastics on the steps of
the Albert Hall. How did we
manage that? Well, when
there’s a cool prize involved,
the momentum’s there and
you’ve got nothing to lose,
then you can pretty much
get freshers to do anything
you want. And did we hesi-
tate? Not for a minute! You
should have seen everyone’s
faces, especially the music
scholars walking out of the
college, shocked, and prob-
ably thinking “What’s wrong
with those IC students?”
I was a bit scared when a
bunch of police officers drove
past. “Technically” we need
a licence to play loud music
in a public place, but luckily
they didn’t stop. Let’s hope
we don’t receive a court sum-
mons in next week’s mail.
You could see there was a
friendly rivalry, which I hope
we can extend to all Imperial
College Faculty Unions. Let’s
continue to all have a laugh
together, because before you
know it, your time at uni is up
and little stories are all that’s
left. The only thing left to say
is that I hope we see you at
one of our next CGCU events.
Watch this space.

“Who’s responsible for the water guns?”
In the CGCU Rat Race 2004, several dozen freshers caused havoc as they searched
for clues and tried to reach their “unspecified destination”. Henri Ozarovsky and
Helen Dawson attempt to put the madness into words
A martial art for the 21st century
By Alex Gibson
Krav Maga is one of the lat-
est martial arts to reach the
UK. Originally developed by
the Israeli Defence Force, it is
now taught to everyone, from
the special forces to civilians
looking for an effective means
of self-defence.
Krav Maga uses instinctive
movements that are easy to
remember in dangerous situ-
ations, and combinations of
strikes, locks and holds to dis-
able attackers. Training also
includes practising with mul-
tiple opponents, and learning
defences against attackers
armed with anything from
knives and baseball bats
to firearms. Environment
awareness is also part of the
course, which can ideally
prevent you from getting into
a confrontation in the first
place.
The overall emphasis is on
training for “real life” situa-
tions, which is reflected in the
scenarios practised. There
is also a strong fitness ele-
ment, with exercises done to
improve strength, coordina-
tion, and dexterity.
I started training at the
London Academy of Krav
Maga (LAKM) last November,
and can highly recommend
the instructors for both their
professionalism and sense of
humour – classes are great
fun to go to as well as provid-
ing high level training. It’s
possible to take on sparring
orientated classes too, as well
as take grades. A number of
seminars are held through-
out the year, with instructors
coming from as far afield as
the US and Israel to demon-
strate and discuss new tech-
niques.
The LAKM have recently
opened up a new venue near
Gloucester Road aimed at
Imperial students, and hope
to establish themselves as
an official Union club soon.
If you’re at all interested,
then why not pop along for
a free introductory lesson?
The Class meets between
4.30 and 6pm on Tuesdays,
at St Stephen’s Church
Hall, 48 Emperor’s Gate
(just off Gloucester Road).
