LIVE REVIEWS
At this moment in time, Pete
Doherty is a man carrying a back-
breaking amount of expectation
with him. After being banned from
playing with The Libertines due to
his continuing drug problem, he has
nearly been imprisoned for an offen-
sive weapon charge and earned a
reputation of not turning up to his
own gigs (of which one no-show
in Aberdeen was greeted with a
crowd riot). He was expected to
pathetically fall from grace, but this
concert was a warning sign to such
naysayers that he is still capable of
performing a blinding rock and roll
show.
Greeted with electrified cheers
from the audience, Pete wasted no
time in ripping into the set opener,
Man Who Came To Stay. Backed
by his group Babyshambles, who
showed they were capable of pound-
ing out jagged rock that could rival
the Libertines, Pete was clearly
pleased to be performing. He sang
his lungs out and even launched
himself into the crowd twice, whilst
all the time being given the crazed
support that most would only associ-
ate with a Michael Jackson concert.
He even got the crowd to sing along
with him when he performed Happy
Birthday for guitarist Pat Walden.
Despite this, you could see that all
was not well with Pete, which was
evident from his wandering atten-
tion span in the early stages of the
set. However, it snapped back when
it came to references to his past,
such as the snarled lyric “What’s
the difference between death and
glory…” on Fuck Forever, and the
accelerating/decelerating Gang
Of Gin, which blasts his former
Libertines bandmates.
The tempo slowed halfway through
the set, when he was joined by
former Massive Attack vocalist Dot
Allison for a few acoustic numbers,
but the main treat of the evening
was the three beautiful renditions
of old Libertines favourites Don’t
Look Back Into The Sun, Time For
Heroes and What Katie Did, the
former accompanied by a stunning
and surprising xylophone arrange-
ment.
After this, the gig went back into
full-on rock mode, which Pete does
best, and after an hour’s set which
ended with the thrashing Wolfman,
he left the stage with the crowd in
hysterics. Despite what the music
press might say about him, this
night showed that Pete is still on
top form, and even if the Libertines
do go under, the Arcadian spirit will
still be carried on, which can only be
good news.

Free tickets
After a week with no competitions (shock horror) we’ve
managed to lay our hands on a couple of tickets to see
the excellent Seether at the Mean Fiddler on Tuesday 19
October.
If you haven’t heard of them, Seether featured on the
Spiderman 2 soundtrack and are absolutely huge in South
Africa, where they are originally from. Their debut album
was among the top sellers of the year in their home coun-
try’s anaemic rock market.
Their new single, Broken, features the vocal stylings
of Evanscence singer Amy Lee and is out right now. The
record has been produced by the well-known nu metal pro-
ducer Jay Baumgardner, who’s also been involved with acts
like Papa Roach and Drowning Pool.
Seether are flying into the UK to play three gigs, and this
is their only one in London. If you want to win these two tick-
ets, just answer this simple question: What was the name of
Evanescence’s all-conquering number one single?
Answers to music.felix@ic.ac.uk please, with “Seether
competition” in the subject line.
Babyshambles: the ever coherent Pete. Why does he even bother to wear a guitar?
I bet this band truly believe the
hype they’ve been gathering. They
probably think they’re “quirky” and
“the next big thing”. Gaining much
critical acclaim, especially following
their tour with fellow merchants-of-
mediocre The Ordinary Boys, the
Kaiser Chiefs (depressingly) may
have their dreams come true.
They’re a bit like Franz Ferdinand
without the originality or risqué
homoeroticism, or Dogs Die In Hot
Cars without the ‘being good’. I wish
I could describe it more, but my
brain is shutting down after having
this on repeat for the last ten min-
utes. I think there’s some honky-
tonk keyboard, a quiet bit, some
handclaps maybe. You get the idea,
just don’t get the single.

Normally, I’d try to put an attention-
grabbing opening paragraph here,
but Marilyn Manson needs no intro-
duction. You know who he is, your
granny knows who he is, and she
doesn’t think he’s at all the sort of
person you should be listening to.
But when was doing what you should
ever any fun?
Personal Jesus, the single taken
from Manson’s best of album Lest
We Forget, fits neatly into the great
tradition of his previous covers: as
with Sweet Dreams and Tainted
Love, he has taken a faintly drippy
eighties classic and invested it with
a generous shot of the anger and bile
that made him famous. The result is
less vitriolic than might have been
expected, but it’s damnably catchy
and, like much of his music, surpris-
ingly fun to dance to.
While it’s true that these days it’s
more about the spectacle than the
music for Mr Manson (was it ever
not?), it’s also true that he really
knowshowtoputonashow.Matching
the decadent aesthetics of his recent
album, The Golden Age of Grotesque,
with its spooky synths, jerky beats
and hoarse vocals, Personal Jesus
– song, video and performance – is
a sight to behold, monochrome suits
and scantily clad ladies and all. Plus,
on a recent appearance on CD:UK,
Manson’s make-up made the under-
tens in the audience cry. The old
dog’s still got it.

SINGLE REVIEWS
Eastern Lane are definitely a singles
band. A couple of bland EPs were
followed up by a decidedly medio-
cre debut album, Shades Of Black.
But then out of nowhere came Feed
My Addiction and Saffron, two taut,
tight and, more importantly, fantas-
tic rock songs.
Now comes the brilliantly titled
I Said Pig On Friday. Some would
say it’s a dark tale of local cus-
tom from their worrying League
Of Gentlemen-esque home town,
Berwick-upon-Tweed. Personally I
prefer describing it as a glorious
slice of storming indie-disco-rock.
It’s another weapon in the growing
arsenal of the budding guitar-music-
you-can-dance-to scene.
I Said Pig On Friday is by no
means as perfect as its title. A kinder
reviewer might describe the main
riff as “infectious”, but I would say
“repetitive”, or even “for God’s sake
people it’s only two notes played
over and over and over again”. And
the bizarre a capella bit sounds wor-
ryingly, um, inbred. There’s a good
chorus though, and it’s got one of
those cool endings, you know, where
it just... stops. Listen out for it at
your local indie disco, and get on the
dance floor.

Where did The Departure spring
from? I’m innocently waiting for
The Killers to play their set when
five young men walk on stage and
start making this awesome, atmos-
pheric, catchy and danceable music.
They look like the offspring from
the make-up sex after the goths and
indie kids have been fighting: all
crazy hair, eye shadow, suit jackets
and, er, golfing jumpers.
Hailing from Northamptonshire
(as far as I’m aware only previously
‘famous’ for Raging Speed Horn),
Be My Enemy is their follow up to
debut All Mapped Out and sounds
like a dark Franz Ferdinand, with
razor sharp drums, duelling echo-
ey vs new-wave guitars, and David
Jones’ weird crazy old man voice.
Intriguing, fresh, exciting and really,
truly great.
