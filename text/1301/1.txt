An Imperial College student
was assaulted in dBs last
Wednesday by Keith Flint, the
former Prodigy vocalist, and
two other men.
Mr Flint, 35, and his new
band Clever Brains Fryin’,
played live at the Union
as part of Freshers Week.
During their performance,
the student, who does not
wish to be named, was appar-
ently dancing the ‘macarena’
in front of the stage. This may
have offended the band mem-
bers. According to witnesses,
Mr Flint and two of his col-
leagues then jumped down off
the stage and began to punch
the student, who was left with
cuts and bruises to the head
and face.
A friend who stepped in
to help the student was also
attacked. The pair were then
forcibly removed from the
venue by Mr Flint’s body-
guards, and the band contin-
ued to play. Later that night,
police officers questioned
the band members and the
student, who eventually
decided not to press charges.
According to a senior Union
source, the police were pre-
pared to make arrests on
the scene for actual bodily
harm.
It has been suggested that
the student’s actions immedi-
ately prior to the incident may
have provoked the attack.
However, a close friend of his
told Felix: “Knowing the guy,
I can’t imagine he would have
said anything offensive to
the band.”
The band denied any wrong-
doing, and it should be noted
that the majority of the dBs
audience enjoyed their per-
formance. The assault was
an isolated incident in an oth-
erwise successful Freshers
Week for Imperial College
Union.
Mr Flint last performed
with The Prodigy two years
ago. He enjoyed huge success
as their front man, reaching
number one in the UK sin-
gles chart with Firestarter
and Breathe in 1996. Clever
Brains Fryin’ are a new dance
band, featuring Flint, MC
Sir Real, MC Bad Manner,
vocalist Cherequi and DJ
Jason Laid Bare. They are
currently touring the coun-
try. It has been confirmed
that they will not appear
at Imperial College Union
again.
Change of heart
The President of Imperial
College Union offered his res-
ignation on Tuesday morning
but then withdrew it a day
later.
