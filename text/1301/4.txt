Entrepreneurs’ Challenge launch
The proposal
Malcolm Glazer, the billion-
aire tycoon, made clear his
planstotakeoverManchester
United as early as next week
using a securitisation deal to
help fund his venture.
This is the second secu-
ritisation deal within a fort-
night to hit the UK markets,
after an earlier bid by Land
Securities, the UK’s biggest
property company, to re-
issue asset-backed bonds and
increase their debt rating.
Glazer’s history of accumu-
lating wealth dates back to
when he made his millions
through owning large stakes
in what later turned out to
be very successful organiza-
tions, including Formica and
Harley Davidson. He also
ownsTampaBayBuccaneers,
who, although they are cur-
rently at the bottom of their
respective American league
table, have had their profit-
able moments.
The attack
In order for Glazer and his
two sons to own Manchester
United, they need to over-
home four major hurdles
and about 100 small ones.
Glazer has yet to offer an
unrefusable premium to the
club’s two biggest sharehold-
ers, JP McManus and John
Magnier, in order to obtain
their share.
The chances that McManus
and Magnier will bow to the
tentative offers made by
Glazer, including a premium
that could see them gain a
£17m profit, are currently
very slim. The pair are no
strangers to the risks asso-
ciated with misplacing their
investments, especially as
they themselves made their
millions through sports bet-
ting.
However, Glazer has shown
himself to be clearly ahead of
the mark by opting for back-
ing from the highly respected
American investment bank,
JP Morgan. The current 300
pence per share offer would
value the club at over £780m,
but this is likely to rise sig-
nificantly as McManus and
Magnier hesitate on the offer
and demand a higher price.
If Glazer can succumb to the
pair’s needs, his next chal-
lenge would be to evade the
thorny arms of Shareholders
United, a commitee set up
to ensure that control of the
club stays with its fans and
not with wealthy individuals
or big businesses.
Next, Glazer will have to
wrestle with the Manchester
Education Committee, whose
invasion of the pitch during
United’s latest game showed
their resentment of Glazer’s
move and their strength in
numbers. It is worth pointing
out that it was these same
commitees and alliances
that battled against Rupert
Murdoch succesfully almost
six years ago.
Having steered his way
past all that, Glazer will most
probably come head to head
with Keith Harris, chair-
man of Seymour Pierce, the
London based investment
bank that has issues over
£450m in equity.
If Glazer reaches this stage,
a fierce battle will no doubt
ensue, and both men cur-
rently have a 50–50 chance of
owning the club. The reader
may at this point be thinking
“Good luck Glazer, you fool”,
but it is worth considering
that he has a massive advan-
tage that could be the turning
point in this affair. Whether
it was advance planning or
just luck, only he knows, but
Glazer has already secured a
19% stake in the club through
his family’s equity holdings.
The payoff
It is almost certain that
if Glazer were to own
Manchester United, his first
move would be to regain the
losses incurred as a result
of the takeover, which are
expected to run into millions.
But what will be his method-
ology in balancing his books?
United fans, as much as
you may enjoy reading these
articles, should look away
now to avoid a panic attack.
Glazer will, like any other
smart investor, recoup his
losses by exploiting your pas-
sion of watching your favour-
ite club play. Ticket prices
for home matches at Old
Trafford could increase by up
to £15 and, combined with the
proposed increase in seating,
could easily generate enogh
revenue in one year to make
Glazer’s takeover well worth
it.
Your intervention
It may seem far fetched, but
the reader could be the
one deciding the face of the
club in just over four years.
Although I promote ‘get
rich quick’ schemes heavily,
this time I will restrain myself
and inform you of another
genuine way to make real
money.
I received an email just a
few days ago inviting me to an
‘Entrepreneurs’ Challenge’.
It started off: “If you’ve ever
said to someone that you’ve
got this really good idea that’s
going to pay for that Ferrari
[Scaglietti, obviously], then
here is the place to prove it.”
The Entrepreneurs’
Challenge, as might be obvi-
ous from it’s name, is for those
who have an innovation that
they are prepared to present
to a panel of judges. And the
reward? Apart from listening
to inspiring speeches by suc-
cessful entrepreneurs, there
are opportunities to compete
in a range of competitions
with prizes ranging from
£250 to £25,000. That won’t be
enough to affect Manchester
United, although receiving
advice from expert consult-
ants and raising investment
capital to make your idea a
reality, like many have done
in the past, will.
Forget supporting Man Utd. Own them!

“If you’ve ever said to some-
one that you’ve got this really
good idea that’s going to pay
for that Ferrari, then here is
the place to prove it.”
This is the fifth year of
Imperial College’s big-
gest business plan compe-
tition, the Entrepreneurs’
Challenge. Each year, over
£55,000 worth of prizes are
awarded to students. Come
along to our launch party on
Tuesday 19 October and find
out how you can enter and
have the opportunity to win
£25,000!
The launch party is your
opportunity to learn how
you can get involved. Piers
Robinson, Student Business
Mentor, will be explaining
how you can enter and win
one of the many prizes. Be
inspired by successful entre-
preneur Dan Germain, one
of the founders at Innocent
drinks, plus hear from previ-
ous winners what they gained
from entering the competi-
tion. The Challenge organis-
ers will also be on hand to
answer to any questions at a
networking and drinks ses-
sion held afterwards at the
Tanaka Business School.
The Challenge is open to
all Imperial College students,
undergraduate and post-
graduate, and is run by the
Entrepreneurship Centre in
the Tanaka Business School.
You do not need to have prior
business or commercial
experience to enter. Previous
winners have come from
a variety of departments,
such as Physics, Medicine,
Mechanical Engineering and
Biological Sciences.
The ‘Ideas Challenge’, the
first part of the competition,
runs in the autumn term and
asks for a 2–3 page summary
of a business idea. Ten £1,000
prizes and ten £250 prizes will
be awarded to the winners at
this stage. In the spring term,
the ‘New Business Challenge’
offers students the opportu-
nity to present a full business
plan for a chance to win the
first prize of £25,000 in cash
and services, one of two run-
ners-up prizes of £5,000 in
cash and services, or a final-
ist cash prize of £1,000.
Weekly presentations take
place to help you develop your
business plan idea, includ-
ing how to generate ideas,
how to protect your ideas,
thinking about your market,
developing a product, ways
to finance your business,
and how to write a business
plan. Teams can also gain
advice from consultants and
use the competition to find
people who will strengthen
the team.
Our teams have been suc-
cessful in London-wide as
well as international busi-
ness plan competitions, prov-
ing Imperial’s students to be
among the best at developing
and presenting ideas. Some
teams have also gone on to
raise investment capital to
make their businesses a real-
ity.
The competition attracts
companies such as McKinsey,
IBM, Psion, Shell, HP
, HSBC,
Barclays Capital, Amadeus
Capital and Innocent Drinks
to sponsor the competition
or pass on their expertise to
our students, meaning that
entrants have a wealth of
experience available to them
as they put their business
plans together.
If you would like to come
to the launch party on
Tuesday 19 October, please
email the Challenge team at
challenge@ic.ac.uk. Spaces
are limited. Hope to see you
there!
