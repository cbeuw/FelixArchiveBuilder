Do you like sushi? Imperial
College scientists have dis-
covered that the puffer fish
(‘fugu’), a Japanese delicacy
known for its deadly after-
taste, may be able to reduce
the spreading of cancerous
cells, otherwise known as
metastasis.
When metastasis occurs,
treatment becomes difficult
and so new ways to diag-
nose the potential metastatic
tumour and suppress it are
needed. The puffer fish pro-
duces a toxin called tetro-
dotoxin (TTX), which can
be deadly since it blocks the
activity of certain ion chan-
nels, normally found in nerve
and muscle cell membranes.
It is so deadly that only the
most skilled (and licensed)
Japanese chefs can prepare
the dish.
So why is this toxin impor-
tant in cancer research? The
Imperial group is a part of the
Biological Sciences depart-
ment. Led by Professor
Mustafa Djamgoz, the team
of PhD and post-doc scien-
tists were the first to dis-
cover that the ability of pros-
tate and breast tumours to
metastasise involved the
expression of TTX-sensitive
ion channels. In other words,
they found that aggressive
tumours seem to become
excitable, rather like nerves
and muscles. These were
identified as voltage-gated
sodium channels (VGSCs)
and were expressed specifi-
cally in prostate and breast
cancer cells that had the abil-
ity to metastasise.
Prostate cancer affects
50% of men by the age of 50.
Treatment includes drastic
surgery which can result in
extreme functional problems.
Breast cancer, although more
easily detectable, affects one
in nine women, both young
and old. In many cases, the
primary tumour is not the
killer, so the ability to dis-
tinguish early whether or
not a tumour will metasta-
sise would save many men
and women from devastating
surgery. The expression of
VGSCs in prostate and breast
cancer may be a novel way of
detecting if the tumour will
metastasise.
Despite on-going phase II
clinical trials of the use of
TTX for treating pain and
heroin addiction, the pros-
pect of utilising TTX for pre-
vention (or cure) of cancer
metastasis remains difficult.
In the meantime, recent
advances by the Imperial
group have been in the devel-
opment of a novel antibody
that exploits the fact that it
is the embryonic form of the
sodium channels that have
an increased response dur-
ing cancer progression. In
breast cancer, this embryi-
onic ion channel differs from
the adult form by 7 amino
acids and so would allow the
antibody enough specificity
to ‘lock’ onto and block the
channel.
In the same way that TTX
blocked the channel and
reduced metastatic behav-
iour, it is hoped that the anti-
body will do the same.
Scott Fraser, a post-doc-
toral scientist in the group,
told Felix: “There is the pos-
sibility that the antibody will
be used for early and defini-
tive diagnosis and therapy of
breast cancer metastasis.”
Headofthegroup,Professor
Djamgoz, commented: “It’s a
good old channel and it is a
viable target for treatment of
metastatic disease. The anti-
body works as a ‘magic bul-
let’ which can either deliver
drugs directly to the tumour
cell or itself become the chan-
nel blocker.”
However, it seems that uti-
lising the same approach for
the prostate cancer VGSC
will be more difficult due to
the channel sequence differ-
ing by only one amino acid.
Professor Djamgoz con-
cluded by saying: “I am still
(also) very optimistic for the
use of natural toxins in the
therapy of metastatic dis-
ease. After all, botulinum
toxin (“botox”) is equally
lethal but works because it
so specific and its dose and
locality of application can be
controlled”.
The group’s research is
well-funded by a number of
organisations, including the
Medical Research Council,
Cancer Research UK, the
Wellcome Trust and the
BBSRC. A series of public
relations exercises also led
to the establishment of a
registered charity (the Pro
Cancer Research Fund, or
PCRF) that supports the
neuroscience approach to
finding novel solutions to the
most common cancers in the
world. The charity also raises
money by organising various
social and sporting events
through the PCRF Support
Group and volunteers.

Still searching for drink-
able decaffeinated coffee?
Bacteria may be the answer.
In a study to be published
in the Journal of the America
Chemical Society, scientists
have claimed to have engi-
neered bacteria to produce a
molecule responsible for the
breakdown of caffeine. This
molecule could be introduced
into coffee plants to create
decaffeinated plants, result-
ing in good-tasting, naturally
decaffeinated coffee.
In coffee plants, caffeine
is produced very quickly but
broken down very slowly,
hence the high caffeine con-
tent. This slow breakdown is
due to a slow-acting decaf-
feinating enzyme. The team
at Emory University, Georgia
engineered bacteria to pro-
duce a faster version of this
decaffeinating enzyme, which
can then be reintroduced into
coffee plants, enabling the
plants to rapidly break down
caffeine.
Chemists Justin Gallivan
and Shawn Desai, who are
behind the work, essentially
used bacteria as miniature
chemical reactors.
In this case, the bacteria
were engineered to depend
on theophylline, the prod-
uct of caffeine breakdown.
However, the bacteria would
not make the theophylline
molecules under normal con-
ditions. This problem was
overcome by making the bac-
teria dependent upon theo-
phylline for survival.
To isolate the enzyme
responsible for converting
the caffeine to theophyl-
line (the product of caffeine
breakdown), DNA thought to
code for the decaffeinating
enzyme was then introduced
into the bacteria.
To ensure that the bacteria
needed this enzyme for sur-
vival, the chemists designed
a ‘survival switch’. This
switch recognised theophyl-
line and turned on a protein
that would give the bacte-
ria antibiotic resistance.
However, only caffeine was
made available to the bac-
teria. As Gallivan explained,
“they now need the break-
down product (theophylline)
of the enzyme for survival,
but they can’t do much with
caffeine”.
Henceexposingthebacteria
to the antibiotic would force
them to rely on the enzyme
to perform the decaffeinating
reaction, produce theophyl-
line, and in turn switch on
the antibiotic resistance and
survive.
“At the end of the day,
we will know that all of the
surviving bacteria have
‘learned’ to break down caf-
feine to theophylline, and
thus contain the enzyme that
we’re interested in,” says
Gallivan.
The fact that the bacteria
now need theophylline for
survival may increase the
enzymes’ efficiency. “We hope
to use this process, known
as directed evolution, to help
speed up the enzyme to break
down coffee faster,” Gallivan
says.
The more efficient enzyme
could then be introduced back
into coffee plants, and voila:
decaffeinated coffee straight
from the plant.
The research is still in its
early stages. Interestingly,
whether the alteration of the
rate of caffeine breakdown
would have any physiological
effect on the plant was not
mentioned.
However, even if this work
does lead to good decaffein-
ated coffee, there is still an
age-old question that this
research cannot answer:
what is the point in drinking
coffee if you don’t get the caf-
feine kick?
