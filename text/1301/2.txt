The government’s plans for
widening access to universi-
ties were dealt a blow this
week, when a report was pub-
lished claiming that select-
ing more students from state
schools rather than private
schools (so-called ‘positive
discrimination’) could be in
breach of human rights law.
The report admitted that
state school pupils did bet-
ter at university than their
private school rivals, but
claimed that universities
must be allowed to be free
of government interference
in student admissions, and
should be able to select stu-
dents solely on merit.
The report was written
by Alan Smithers, from the
University of Buckingham
(the only private universi-
ty in the country) and was
applauded by private schools,
which funded his research.
They claim that to reject an
applicant simply on the basis
of his attending a private
school is to breach his human
rights.
This is another blow in
the Government’s long-run-
ning admissions saga, which
foundered this week when
figures revealed that Oxford
had admitted 20% fewer state
school pupils than its target.
In addition, earlier in the
year Bristol University were
accused of ‘social engineer-
ing’ for admitting state school
pupils with lower grades than
their private school rivals.
The problems with
admission stem from the
Government’s wish to have
50% of pupils in higher educa-
tion, which will require many
more state school pupils
being successful. Critics say
that the only way to achieve
this fairly is to have a much
more transparent admis-
sions system, with students
applying to universities only
after they know their A level
results. Other suggestions
include individual module
marks appearing on the
UCAS form, and the develop-
ment of new aptitude tests,
like those already being used
in medical and veterinary
school admissions.
Whether the admissions
policy of Bristol does contra-
vene human rights is an issue
that will have to be decided in
the courts, but the report may
persuade the Government
that the way forward for
admissions is to develop tests
and interviews that examine
the ability to learn of the
student, and not the level
of coaching that has taken
place. Taking students’ back-
grounds into account in the
admissions process may be
fairer, but this also demands
a lot of time in interview and
cannot ever form a perfectly
fair system.
Whichever selection meth-
od does take place in the
future, it seems certain to
be post-results, meaning that
applications are not wasted
and only those students with
the appropriate grades need
apply to a particular course.
Selecting more state school pupils may
breach human rights of those rejected

Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union,
offered his resignation on
Tuesday morning but then
withdrew it a day later.
In an email to the Union
Council Chair and the
College’s Clerk to the Court
and Council, Mr Arif said: “I
no longer believe that I am
up to the job. I don’t think
it’s in anyone’s best inter-
ests for me to continue in
office. In accordance with the
Regulations, I therefore here-
by offer my resignation as
President of Imperial College
Union.”
Mr Arif was first elected to
the post of Union President
in March 2003, and was voted
in to serve a second term in
February this year.
Students and staff were
shocked at the news when
it emerged on Tuesday. The
timing of the decision was
particularly surprising, com-
ing at the beginning of the
academic year and just after
a successful Freshers Week.
When Felix asked him why
he had offered to resign, Mr
Arif replied: “Hey. Things
happen.”
By Wednesday, the
President had decided to stay
on, and was confident that
he was “the best person for
the job”. However, he decided
to submit himself to a vote
of confidence at Monday’s
Union Council meeting.
He told Felix: “Do I look
like a quitter? Richard Walker
[the Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies)] and I stood for
election in 2003 with manifes-
tos of things that we wanted
to achieve to make Imperial
a better place. We were able
to do many of the little things
[last year], but few of the big
things, and that was down
to the steep learning curve
of being a sabbatical officer.
That was why we stood for re-
election last year – because
we needed a second year to
finish the job, having learnt
how to do it in the first year.
There’s no way I’m not going
to see it through.”
In an official statement, the
President said: “After much
thought I have come to the
conclusion that it is in the
best interests of the Union
that I continue in office and
serve out the remainder of
my term. I have therefore
advised the Chairman of
Union Council and the Clerk
to the College’s Court and
Council of my decision to con-
tinue in post, which they have
accepted. I shall, however,
be submitting myself to a
vote of confidence at Union
Council on Monday 18 October
2004.”
