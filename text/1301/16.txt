ALBUM REVIEWS
With their counter-culture packag-
ing, angled fringe haircuts and mon-
umentally stupid name, you’d be
forgiven for writing off yourcodena-
meis:milo as yet another Converse-
worshipping ‘emo’ band. I’d already
done it without listening to a note.
But instead of bastardising At The
Drive-In’s back catalogue by feed-
ing through Pro-Tools and making
it pop (cf. Finch), yourcodenameis:
milo clearly have a little more ambi-
tion.
Their sound is a sometimes dis-
quieting mix of lurching, stop-start
riffage, slower progressive guitar
passages and the occasional monu-
mental chorus. They’ve inherited
At The Drive-In’s love for complex
dual riffs and innovative chord pro-
gressions, Biffy Clyro’s relentless
volume changes, and the mighty
Trail Of Dead’s gloriously over-the-
top vocals.
Opener All Roads To Fault welds
a schizophrenic, shouty verse to a
truly massive guitar-destroying cho-
rus that’s convincing enough proof
of the band’s intent. It helps that it
has a hook roughly the size of every
Strokes chorus put together. The
Problem jerks from quiet to loud
almost without warning, providing
one of the most thrilling moments
on the album, while Fourthree sees
yourcodenameis:milo using their
quiet side: pretty, lilting guitars join
the heavy moments together, provid-
ing a little relief from the assault.
Capturing the sound of live, heavy
guitar music has always been a real
challenge for producers – records
just won’t sell if the guitars don’t
sound just right. Luckily for your-
codenameis:milo, they managed to
secure the legendary Steve Albini
behind the desk. Once again, his
touch proves essential to this record
– as First Mater Responds moves
from its heavily compressed verse
into a huge wall of grinding distor-
tion with squiggly guitar arpeggios
dancing everywhere, you can almost
picture the huge grin on his face.
The duelling, call-and-response gui-
tars on the high point of the album
Lions, Then Donkeys will induce
headbanging not seen since “One
Armed Scissor” in all but the most
sedate.
If anything, yourcodenameis:milo
have found a ‘sound’ that’s incred-
ibly mature for a band so young.
Unlike, say, Reuben, they’ve not
painted themselves into a stylistic
corner. If you’ve heard a few records
from what could be loosely termed
the British rock underground –
bands like Million Dead and Pretty
Girls Make Graves – I can guar-
antee you’ll find something in this
record to love.

There’s something just a tiny bit
terrifying about Nick Cave. It could
be his Neanderthal eyebrows, his
impressive bird’s nest hairstyle, or
his grave, cadaverous stare. But I
think it’s probably the total surreal-
ism of almost everything he does.
Utterly compelling, but a tiny bit
terrifying.
Two albums packaged as one,
Abattoir Blues and The Lyre Of
Orpheus deliver a double dose of the
delightful Cave madness. Sounding,
at various times, like frenetic jazz,
disjointed blues, energetic country,
smooth easy listening, gothic bal-
ladry and a gospel choir on crack,
this is an eclectic mix united by a
morbid exuberance and some frank-
ly quite mental lyrics. All gleefully
intoned in Cave’s sepulchral vocals,
they range from the self-mocking
(“I look at you and you look at me
and deep in our hearts know it /
That you weren’t much of a muse,
but then I weren’t much of a poet”)
to the vaguely obscene (“I put one
hand on your round ripe heart /
And the other down your panties”)
to the mildly confusing (“I’m down
here babe with the eskimos / With
the polar bears and the Arctic snow
/ With a party of penguins who do
not know / How I can get back to
thee”). Referencing historical and
literary figures from Karl Marx to
the ancient Greek poet Sappho, it’s
an intelligent and amusing collec-
tion that will have you discovering
new gems listen after listen.
The music itself is heavy on the
percussion and ‘unusual’ instru-
ments – panpipes, anyone? While
fairly simple, it has a drive that
renders it almost hypnotic. At times,
it seems that the Bad Seeds have
lost their habitual gloom to begin
producing almost upbeat ditties; at
others the familiar malaise returns
with renewed intensity. Not really
one for the emotionally unstable,
Abattoir Blues and The Lyre Of
Orpheus is definitely an acquired
taste – the spooky, dominating
vocals and schizophrenic rhythms
can be unsettling to say the least.
But those who dare to brave the
lunacy – or who have already picked
up the urge – will find themselves
listening for hours with a silly little
grin on their faces. Mad as a fish
with a motorbike but just as much
fun, this is a nice little treat that just
keeps on giving.

You might not have heard of The
Soundtrack Of Our Lives (TSOOL),
but on first listen they are instantly
familiar. This six piece from Sweden
are fronted by a man who insists on
wearing a toga all the time, sounding
at times like Exile On Main Street-
era Rolling Stones, and at others
the rightful heirs to Pink Floyd’s
throne.
2001’s Behind The Music brought
TSOOL to the attention of the UK
mainstream music press. This, their
first album for three years, carries
on exactly were Behind The Music
left off. It is an album that grabs you
from the first note, and before you
know it, you’ve picked up the entire
lyrics and sang it to yourself as you
wait for the bus. Or at least, I have.
The single Bigtime is a perfect
example of TSOOL
’s sound, incor-
porating pleasingly dirty guitars, a
riff that Keith Richards would chew
his own arm off for, and a suitably
bizarre lyric about the damage done
to society by technology from the fan-
tastically named Ebbot Lundberg.
By the time the anthemic, air-guitar
friendly chorus rolls around, you’re
nodding along while Lundberg yells,
somewhat cryptically, “Big time!
We’re all partners in crime!”
The immediacy of every single
song on this record is truly refresh-
ing, but that’s not to say it’s predict-
able. Much more than that – TSOOL
take the same chord changes you’re
heard a thousand times from a thou-
sand different guitar bands, and
somehow make it sound fresh. A
clever riff here, a well-placed vocal
line there, and you begin to see how
good a band with six very talented
songwriters can be. And they’re
Swedish, which always seems to
help.
Lyrically, Lundberg is quirky and
direct. He’s not singing in his native
language, which often has the effect
of making the simplest lines sound
slightly odd. His voice has a won-
derful smoky edge to it, which he
layers over itself many times – it’s
almost as if there’s a bizarre choir of
Lundbergs singing every word with
him. On Midnight Children, he lets
his bassy voice ring over a groov-
ing guitar and spacey organ figure,
rescuing the track from mediocrity.
In fact, when the quality control does
fall, as it does in the middle of the
album, the vocals are usually the
thing that saves you pressing the
skip button.
Just like Behind The Music, the
interplay between the two very tal-
ented and endlessly versatile guitar-
ists, Ian Person and Mattias Bärjed,
is what drives the record. Along with
the aforementioned Bigtime, Royal
Explosion showcases their harder,
power-riffing style. Heading For A
Breakdown has a delicate two note
pattern in the foreground, and a gen-
ius bluesy figure in the background.
TSOOL aren’t exactly innova-
tive; in fact, they’re positively retro.
This record isn’t quite as good as
Behind The Music, which featured
a more diverse sound than that dis-
played here. Some people may tire
of the relentless ‘borrowing’ from
the great rock bands of the last 40
years, but the unique spin they put
on it prevents them from becoming
a cover band. Origin I isn’t a classic,
but a worthy introduction if you’ve
not picked up on them before.
