The joy of... bike sheds
Be safe on the streets
It’s that time of year again, it’s start-
ing to feel cold, people are starting
to wear scarves and heavier coats,
and some people are being even
more miserable than usual. Yes
folks, winter is coming.
In the winter months, it is impor-
tant not only to keep warm, but
also to keep yourself and your pos-
sessions safe. In a couple of weeks,
the clocks go back and that journey
home suddenly takes place in the
dark. At these times, it is important
to be aware of personal and posses-
sion safety issues. Here are some
facts, figures and safety tips to help
you during your time at Imperial.
Around one third of students
become victims of crime while at
university. Latest Home Office fig-
ures have revealed that domestic
break-ins rose by 7.9% over the past
year and that 11.8% of students in
private accommodation experienced
domestic burglary.
Street criminals range from your
Artful Dodger to your Bill Sykes.
Muggers will target your wallet and
your mobile phone, while more vio-
lent types might want to physically
harm you.
Over 100,000 bicycles are reported
stolen every year. They are a popu-
lar target with thieves because they
can easily be sold.
Below you’ll find the Union Advice
Service’s top ten tips for protect-
ing yourself, your home and your
wheels:
● Lock your bedroom door, even if
you’re only going to the kitchen or
bathroom.
● Check doors and windows are
locked at night or when going out
– don’t assume someone else will
do it.
● Make a list of your personal prop-
erty, including the serial number
and descriptions. Use an ultraviolet
pen to mark electrical and other
items with your Imperial College
address, followed by your identifica-
tion number on your student card.
Alternatively, mark property with
your parents’ postcode. Not only will
this make it easier to trace stolen
property but it can help police gain
evidence about offenders.
● Think ahead. Don’t walk home
alone late at night – arrange in
advance to stay with a trusted friend
or pre-book a taxi.
● Never leave drinks unattended
in pubs or clubs. When you go to
the toilet, ask your friends to keep
an eye on your drink. Try to have
your drinks in bottles and cover the
top with your thumb when walking
around. Men’s drinks get spiked too.
If you suspect your drink has been
spiked, contact a member of staff or
tell a trusted friend.
● Don’t show off your cash, mobile
phone or laptop, or leave them lying
around. Never leave your bag, wallet
or purse unattended, and don’t carry
your chequebook and card together.
Take out protection for your credit
cards and note all your card details
at home, so you can cancel them
quickly if they’re stolen.
● Try to go to the cash point in day-
light if possible. Be aware of people
standing too close to you, and always
conceal your PIN. If it’s dark, go with
a friend if you can and don’t check
your money in full view.
● Always lock doors, windows, the
boot and sunroof when leaving your
car, even if it’s only for a minute.
● Never leave belongings in a car
– even an old coat could tempt a thief
that there might be something valu-
able in the pockets. If you have to
leave anything, lock it in the boot.
● Keep cars topped up with petrol
and park in busy, well-lit areas.
Remember, the Union Advice
Service give out personal safety
alarms to students for free.
For further advice on all personal
safety issues, please contact the
Student Adviser, Nigel Cooke, on 020
7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.
● The Student Adviser will be
in the JCR today from 11am
until 3pm to answer your ques-
tions and give out information,
personal attack alarms and
condoms.

What are more important?
Doughnuts or votes?
The case for doughnuts:
Doughnuts are generally quite
nice. The texture of a doughnut is
a work of art that tickles the fancy
of the taste buds of many of the
great and good. Doughnuts, when
they have fillings, provide a sensu-
ous gastronomical experience. They
are great cold and fantastic hot, but
whatever you do, don’t put them
in the microwave (the filling heats
much, much, faster than the dough
and you’ll burn your tongue). You
can buy a packet of five doughnuts
from Tesco for the price of £1.
The case for votes:
Votes are power. Votes in Union
elections help ensure that the Union
is representative of your views.
Voting shows the College that you
believe in the principle of student
representation (even if you just vote
‘New Election’ because you think
the candidates are all rubbish).
More votes means that your depart-
ment has more reason to listen to
your views when making changes
to courses and facilities that affect
you.
What’s more, this year, Imperial
College Union is trialling ‘Mustafa’s
club and society bonus funding
bonanza’. It’s very simple. When you
cast your vote, you get to nominate
a Union club or society to receive an
extra 25p of funding to their budget.
Let’s put that in perspective. Four
votes give your club £1. That’s five
Tesco doughnuts for the price of
four votes. Bonus. No brain-er, any-
one?
OK, let’s cut to the chase. From
today until the end of the weekend,
you can vote online for members of
Union Council, Committees, ULU
Council and various faculty and
departmental vacancies, at www.
union.ic.ac.uk/vote. Do it now. Get
your doughnuts.
Trust
Elected student officers hold a posi-
tion of trust. What is trust? Trust
is not a tangible entity. It’s not a
commodity we can buy or sell. It’s
easy to destroy but very difficult to
rebuild.
UnionOfficersare“trustees”under
English charity law. Nevertheless,
trust is more deep-rooted than that.
As elected officers, we have to oper-
ate on a principle of trust. You have
to believe that we hold your best
interest interests at heart. You have
to have faith in us to represent your
views accurately and to the best of
our ability. You have to trust us to do
‘the right thing’ – when no-one actu-
ally knows what ‘the right thing’ is,
other than that their idea is different
to everyone else’s.
At the end of the day you have to
believe, without any doubt, that your
elected representatives will do their
best – and do what they believe to
be ‘the right thing’ to serve your
interests. If you don’t have such
faith in election candidates, vote
‘New Election’. If you do have such
faith then give them a chance to
prove themselves. What appears to
be ‘wrong’ may turn out to be ‘right’
in the end.
Resignation?
You may have heard that I’m quit-
ting. I’m not a quitter. I was elect-
ed to a job. I shall see it through
because I know I’m the best person
to see it through, even if the pres-
sure sometimes gets a bit much.
End of story. This week’s other news
stories are more interesting and
important.
This week’s competition
If a Union club or society gets a real-
ly, really huge amount of votes cast
in the elections (I’m not sure what
‘huge’ means yet since it’ll depend
on turnout), then they’ll get a prize.
I’m not sure what the prize will be
yet, but it might involve doughnuts.
If you’re lucky.
Bike Sheds, bike sheds, bike sheds.
They’ve become urban legends
in some schools (and perhaps in
revered institutes of higher educa-
tion), where they are renowned for
exploratory sexual encounters or
the illicit abuse of drugs.
But why am I talking about them?
Well, cyclists’ parking facilities have
occupied quite a lot of my time
over the summer. The President
had received numerous complaints
regarding the new Faculty Building
bike store (that’s in the blue Lego
cube, for the uninitiated) and the
removal of cycle racks around the
campus. On a long journey back
from Birmingham, he asked me if
I cycled, to which I foolishly replied
that I had been known to, and the
rest, as they say, is history.
Imperial College has traditionally
been the crime hot-spot of South
Kensington, thanks to the high inci-
dence of bike theft and vandalism,
so in response to this, a few years
ago, the Union lobbied College for
secure cycle parking facilities. The
original plan was to put the facility
under the walkway, but when they
started to draw up plans for the
Faculty Building, that was seen as a
better location.
Back in May, when the Building
had been completed, a College
notice was sent out informing all
cyclists who wanted to use the new
store to register their bikes with
College Security. This was neces-
sary for two reasons: access to the
store is by swipe card only, so they
need to know who should be allowed
in there, and in the case where bikes
are stolen on campus, the crime is a
lot easier to follow up if the cyclist
has registered.
There were teething problems
with the project, but Estates staff
have promised to improve the condi-
tions in the bike store.
In addition to the creation of the
new facility, there has been a strat-
egy of concentrating cycle parking
facilities in certain key locations
across the campus, where visibil-
ity and security are good. Another
improvement is the new covered
racks in Beit Quad, secured through
funding from Transport for London.
One of the most exciting develop-
ments is an open meeting to which
I would like to invite all interested
parties, which will also be attended
by the Assistant Director of Estates,
to discuss cyclists’ concerns. It will
be held on Wednesday 20 October at
5pm in the Read Lecture Theatre.
I have also set up a mailing list
for people to stay abreast of the
latest developments. To subscribe,
send an email to bike-users-
subscribe@imperial.ac.uk. One of
the things I shall be aiming to do in
the future is set up a users’ group
that can discuss cycle rack issues
on a regular basis and provide feed-
back to Estates, who will hopefully
be in a position to improve things.
If you have any views on the topic,
please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
