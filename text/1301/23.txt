Shooting success?
23
By Sam Dash
The Rifle and Pistol club
has had a very mixed year.
To start off, they lost two of
their best rifle shooters. That
meant any chance of success
in rifle leagues was dramati-
cally reduced. Then they had a
flood at their range, meaning
that they couldn’t start shoot-
ing for the first two weeks.
In addition, some guns were
damaged in the process.
However, after a bad start,
things started looking up. A
lot of people were interested
in clay pigeon shooting, which
meant that there was a full
team to represent Imperial
at the BUSA championships.
In fact, many of the team had
only started shooting clay
pigeons earlier in the year.
The true disaster this year
came with the closing down of
therange.Therangehadbeen
built with the aid of the club in
the 1970s, and although it was
small it was also very handy.
It will become a storage room
now – what a brilliant use for
bullet-resistant walls!
The club has now relocated
to the huge Stock Exchange
Rifle Range, which, although
spacious with many different
gadgets and a self service bar,
is unfortunately in Moorgate.
The club hopes to subsidise
travel to and from the range.
They have also armoured a
small cupboard on the South
Kensington campus to store
shotguns, which will make it
easier for them to organise
clay shooting excursions.
Despite the numerous
setbacks, last year still pro-
vided some successes. Isao
Matsumoto was able to win
his prone rifle class in the
NRSA Eley championships.
Leo Fok came third for the
third year in a row in his air
pistol class at the same cham-
pionships. Members went to
the national air pistol cham-
pionships, the NRA Imperial
meeting, and all BUSA shoot-
ing events. Perhaps not the
club’s best year, but a fine
year nevertheless.

Hello again friends, and welcome
once more to the fish tank.
In my desperate search for a cross-
word to test your skills this week, I
was faced with two options: raid the
archives and steal an old puzzle, or
take the dangerous step of attempt-
ing to reincarnate Mummy Huffwell. I
chose the latter, and I hope you enjoy
the result.
Naturally, any errors found in the
puzzle are due to Mummy H’s trance-
like state as she wandered aimlessly
around the office this afternoon. I
would like to think that my clues pre-
vented us from wandering aimlessly
towards a very bad crossword, but
that is for you to decide. Fishface
Issue 1300 solution
Last week’s winner is Larry Booker. Well done!
Send your answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk or bring this page down to the Felix office in

providing them with almost unlimited kudos and self-satisfaction. Everyone who provides
us with a correct solution will get an entry into our prize draw at the end of the year

SHOOTING
“A gun isn’t a weapon, it’s a tool, like a butcher knife or a harpoon or a... a... an alligator.” Members of the Rifle and Pistol Club pose with some of their weapons (or should that be tools?)
