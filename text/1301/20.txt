I had forgotten how much I love the
Tate Modern. Making the trek down
the District Line, I fully expected to
stay in the gallery for about half an
hour to take in a new photography
exhibition, and ended up wandering
around for most of the afternoon.
If you go to one gallery in London
this year, make it this one. Where
else do you find such a mixture
of modern masters and experi-
mental spaces? Where else can
you walk straight from works by
Picasso, Modigliani and Spencer,
to a massive sound-video instal-
lation showing nocturnal animals
passing through the artist’s studio
at night (Mapping the Studio by
Bruce Nauman)?
If you do go, take the time to find
the west door and enter through the
Turbine Hall. This towering indus-
trial space usually houses a large-
scale work of art, and the glass roof
and steel rafters make a fantastic
array of shadows in the space, dem-
onstrating that floor-to-ceiling con-
crete can be beautiful.
The exhibition I went to see is
by a Malian photographer called
Mohamed Camara, born in 1985,
and who only started taking photos
in 2001. All this makes him a bit
intimidating. His works are the third
part of a series called The Public
World of the Private Space, which
showcases new works by interna-
tional artists not well known in the
UK. This is in fact Camara’s first
exhibition in Britain, and his first in
a public gallery.
The exhibition contains a collec-
tion of about 60 photographs and a
video, all of which deal with domes-
tic subject matter from Camara’s
hometown, Bamako in Mali. What
is immediately striking about the
photos is their intense use of light
and shadow. Many depict everyday
scenes inside dark houses partially
illuminated from blinding sunshine
coming through doorways and cur-
tains. The pictures demonstrate pov-
erty – Mali is one of the world’s poor-
est countries, mixed with accents of
western life such as football shirts
and adidas shorts, illustrating the
influences of youth culture.
Camara captures movement and
activity as if it were an accident from
unusual viewpoints, like glancing
through a window, around a corner,
or reflected in a mirror. He takes the
position of an impartial onlooker – it
is as if his presence is accidental,
yet many of the shots are set up,
and his exceptional use of vertical
lines, light and shade, strong blues
and earthy browns are reminiscent
of portraiture and still life, without
appearing contrived or false. Their
intimacy and use of angle implies
that rather than looking in on life,
the artist is looking through the
domestic scene around him into the
outside world.
Curtains and drapes, along with
the blinding sunlight they shade, are
important in this series. They are
used to hide aspects of the domes-
ticity Camara is capturing, and to
reveal intimate details of the lives
on show. Camara repeatedly cap-
tures sleeping or relaxed people,
and the contrasts of white light and
black shadows deaden these scenes,
creating an intoxicatingly drowsy
atmosphere.
The video, Les Rideaux de
Camara, 2004, continues the theme
of curtains as focal points from the
photograph collection. It consists of
a series of interior shots of curtains
blowing in the wind, and records
the movements in and out of the
house. These are representative of
the recurring theme of viewing the
bright, light outside world from the
dark interior. The continual flutter-
ing of the curtains reveals the scene
both by showing the exterior activ-
ity, and by momentarily illuminat-
ing the inside of the house. These
shafts of light catch the texture of
the walls, the objects on the floor
and the edges of figures, intrusively
permitting a slight glance of the
lives surrounding the static position
of the camera.
The images are hypnotic – the
repetitive billowing of the curtain,
theimpenetrableblackoftheinterior
and the sporadic movement around
the viewer, who gains a viewpoint
of intimate observation of a routine
with a continuous, timeless quality.
They capture mesmerising domes-
ticity of faceless people, and though
the actual view changes frequently,
the overall impression is of repeti-
tiveness and normality described in
an honest and intimate way.
If you are interested in photog-
raphy and emerging talent, this
exhibition is certainly worth seeing.
Taking time to look closely at the
images reveals a wealth of intricate
detail and gives privileged access
to a private world.
If you’re not tempted by this
exhibition, take the time to go
to the Tate Modern anyway. The
permanent collection is an excel-
lent combination of more famous
works and emerging talent – it’s
not all piles of bricks! Each time
you go, things have changed and
there are new areas to discover.
For example, I found a storytell-
ing opera describing the process of
sexual differentiation in the womb
using images from fantasy, Celtic
legend and fetishism. The work,
Cremaster 5, by Matthew Barney, is
described as a ‘personal mythology
for a fragmented world’ and ends
with one man dropping from a vine
and another sinking in the Danube,
symbolising the dropping testicles
and creation of a male baby. Odd,
but certainly creative. Enjoy.
● The Turbine Hall this week
receives its latest installation.
For our enjoyment (at least until
28 March 2005), the Tate Modern
has commissioned American artist
Bruce Nauman.
Nauman is known for his use of
a wide variety of media in his art.
For this project, he has chosen to
produce a sound work featuring the
human voice.
The Turbine Hall installations are
known for their power and innova-
tive approaches to what we fondly
call art. Hopefully Nauman’s con-
tribution to the Unilever Series
will live up to the expectations of a
public that was stupendously spoilt
last year by Olafur Eliasson’s The
Weather Project. For those of you
who can’t remember what that was,
I mean the one where the Sun was
indoors.
It has also been announced that
Unilever have decided to extend
their sponsorship of the Turbine
Hall installations by a further five
years. So, if Nauman proves to be a
disappointment, at least we should
have five more chances of seeing
something as good as last year’s
installation.
On a slightly related tangent:
Nauman studied maths and physics
before finding his calling.

The Tate Modern, just in case you don’t know what it looks like, from St Paul’s Cathedral
“The images capture
mesmerising
domesticity of
faceless people”
I’ve been doing a quite a fair bit of
walking around town lately, as one
often ends up doing when showing a
visitor round. Apart from the result-
ing aching legs and sore feet, not to
mention a renewed lack of faith in
London Transport, the whole experi-
ence has been quite enjoyable.
When you live in London you miss
so many sights, or in my case you
really begin to take them for grant-
ed. Not only is London bursting at
the seams with museums and gal-
leries, but we also have a fantastic
number of historical sights and a
wealth of glorious architecture.
London has examples of so many
different architectural styles (though
I must say that all this awful sixties
stuff has to go, and soon if at all pos-
sible). The timescale that the archi-
tecture spans here is vast – there are
Roman remains in the City and even
we at Imperial are at the vanguard
of design with our very own Norman
Foster business school entrance.
Architecture is most definitely a
form of art, but unfortunately it is
one that is mostly forgotten by both
art lovers and philistines alike. So, if
you know something about architec-
ture or are at all interested, please
feel free to inform the rest of us
through these pages. My own knowl-
edge of architecture doesn’t stretch
much beyond Inigo Jones and a very
detailed array of useless information
about Chiswick House for which I
have GCSE History to thank.
On another subject, I went to the
opera quite recently, and more of
you should do so too. Opera is quite
possibly my favourite art form, and I
like to plug it as much as possible.
The Royal Opera’s season is well
under way, as is that of the English
National Opera at the newly refur-
bished Coliseum. Both are currently
doing productions of Mozart operas,
so there are no excuses not to go.
Mozart always writes good tunes,
and he can also be funny (unlike
a certain Mr Shakespeare whose
sense of humour has not really stood
the test of time as well as it could
have).
As I have a little bit of space left to
fill: Marcelo Alvarez is a wonderful
tenor who should be heard, even if
only on a recording.
