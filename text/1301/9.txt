Imperial College is in the
privileged position of hav-
ing several fully fledged
orchestras. Apart from the
grand institution that is the
Symphony Orchestra, there is
the lesser known Sinfonietta
who, as well as performing
two concerts every year, also
organise a tour to foreign
climes. Previous tours have
taken in Paris, Stockholm and
Barcelona, but the 2004 tour
was to be a three country
Baltic odyssey including four
concerts, two soloists and a
lot of vodka.
It began at a moderately
respectable hour on Thursday
morning in a crowded ter-
minal at Heathrow, pack-
ing double basses in bubble
wrap and pleading for a more
flexible luggage allowance.
Before long, we were touch-
ing down at a snowy Helsinki
airport for a three day stay
in Finland. After moving into
the youth hostel where we
were staying, everyone start-
ed exploring Helsinki which,
for me, involved a fantastic
meal before getting lost on
the freezing streets. Helsinki
is a quiet city; not surprising
as the Finns have a reputa-
tion for being reserved.
The next day, many peo-
ple took the short boat trip
through the frozen har-
bour to the fortress island
Suomenlinna. Cue mass
snowball fights. Our first con-
cert was that evening in the
worldfamousTemppelieukion
kirkko, a church cut out of
a rock, in central Helsinki.
Here we performed the
William Tell Overture,
Elgar’s Cello Concerto
with soloist Ed Furse, and
Dvorak’s Symphony Number
8 to an enthusiastic Finnish
audience.
On Sunday morning, after
the second concert and a
night watching rugby in a
French bar, the orchestra had
to get their hungover selves
to the harbour to take the
early ferry across the Baltic
to Tallinn, capital of Estonia.
The main entertainments
catered for on the ferry were
ballroom dancing and bingo.
The Estonian band’s cover of
Mrs Robinson was unforget-
table–thinkTheLemonheads
in 40 years time.
Tallinn is one of the best
preserved medieval cities in
Europe, and the ancient walls
and spires were spectacular.
Highlights included climbing
to the top of the largest tower,
part of the Estonian parlia-
ment, and a meal at a medie-
val restaurant complete with
costumed waiters, authentic
dishes and clay tankards for
the beer.
The concert the next day
featured Oliver Coates play-
ing the Dvorak Cello concerto
in another huge church, the
Kaarli Kirik, which was on
a hill overlooking the town.
After this, it was off to the
Beerhouse for a grand tour
meal and much drinking.
Here, beer was served in
one litre stein glasses. These
colossal vessels could have
caused some problems, as
after the meal it was on to
our private coaches to drive
five hours across the Russian
border to St Petersburg.
Fortunately, a pit stop was
taken. Crossing the border
with over 50 drunken stu-
dents was an experience to
say the least, but with the
bureaucracy behind us we
arrived in St Petersburg for
brunch.
Nothing can prepare you
for the sights and sounds of St
Petersburg. Our hotel was by
the River Neva, next to where
the Aurora, the famous battle-
ship that signalled the start of
the revolution, is moored. A
short walk away was the St
Peter Paul fortress, with its
infamous prison and cathe-
dral with its stunning golden
spire. Over the river was the
golden dome of St Isaac’s
cathedral, the breathtaking
opulence of the Winter Palace
and Hermitage museum, and
also the must see Russian
Orthodox ‘church on spilled
blood’, built on the spot where
Tsar Alexander II was mur-
dered.
To explore this city com-
pletely would take months.
Russian food and drink was
good and cheap, so many of
the orchestra chose to try
dishes such as caviar, stur-
geon or an authentic beef
stroganoff.
The final concert of the tour
was to take place in the con-
cert hall of our hotel, attend-
ed by an appreciative audi-
ence of fellow guests. All that
was needed now was an end
of tour party. This was fuelled
by beer at 40p a bottle and
copious quantities of a clear
liquid that is very prominent
in Russia; its name, along
with the finer details of the
night, escape me. Suffice
to say there was attempted
Cossack dancing at one point,
and I still have the bruises.
The coaches then took us
back to Helsinki to catch the
plane home. Special thanks
must go to our conductor Dan
Capps, chairman Adam Smith
who organised this mammoth
tour, and soloists Ed Furse
and Oliver Coates.
This coming Easter,
the orchestra will be off to
Vienna, sometime home to
Mozart and centre of the
musical world for centuries,
and Bratislava, historic capi-
tal of Slovakia. Expectations
of another successful tour
are high after seeing the pic-
tures of Viennese palaces and
hearing that beer is 30p a pint
in Bratislava. Make sure you
don’t miss out.
Sinfonietta rehearse every
Monday evening in the Great
Hall. For further informa-
tion about joining, visit www.
union.ic.ac.uk/arts/sinfoni-
etta. Our next concert will be
on Tuesday 14 December in
the Great Hall. Look out for
posters nearer the time.

SINFONIETTA
By Chris Jackson
RAG Chair
Welcome to another article
from Imperial College Union
RAG which I have the honour
of fronting this year. Following
on from my previous article,
this one is a mixture of thanks
and apologies.
Firstly, some thanks are
due to those who visited us at
the Freshers Fair and helped
us get our fundraising off the
zero mark with a nice £108.31
for our charities, which are
the Mercury Phoenix AIDS
Trust and Cancer Research
UK. I know this may not be
the world’s biggest amount,
but it is a start, and if you feel
we should be raising more
then get involved and make it
happen! The freshers meet-
ing, for anyone who wants
to find out more (or didn’t
get round to seeing us at the
fair), will be on Thursday 21
October at midday in dBs. I
look forward to seeing some
of you there.
The mention of Freshers
Fair brings me onto the apol-
ogies section. Some might
think that an apology to
the City and Guilds College
Union is in the offing for the
‘borrowing’ of their mascot
Spanner. Others might think
I am about to say sorry to
the poor Union staff on the
radios who were reportedly
trying to locate it, or to those
who couldn’t get more press-
ing problems sorted out due
to the radios being clogged
up as people searched for
the aforementioned piece of
brass. But no, I am apologis-
ing to none of these people,
and only to the student popu-
lation in general for not man-
aging to extort more than £10
out of City and Guilds College
Union President John Collins
for Spanner’s safe return.
Such derogatory payments to
RAG charities (from a former
RAG treasurer no less) must
be dealt with, so watch out
CGCU, we’ll be back.
The other apology must
go to those who were hop-
ing to join the pub crawl that
was mentioned previously
in these hallowed pages.
Sadly, due to a mistake by the
Metropolitan Police relating
to collecting licences, this has
had to be postponed. With a
bit of luck and no more prob-
lems, it should be back before
Christmas. Watch this space!
Other events in the off-
ing include something for
Children In Need, which this
year is on 19 November, and
the World AIDS Day mega-
raid on 27 November. This
is the perfect chance for all
of you who asked questions
like “Are you the people who
run around doing crazy stuff
for charity?” to do just that.
Keep the date free; details
will follow.
Finally, Dave (Felix editor)
seems to think it is a good
plan for RAG to feature regu-
larly in this publication, so
you have the privilege of look-
ing forward to some more of
my inane bumblings in the
future whenever I feel I have
something to tell you about.
In the meantime, keep an eye
on the RAG website, www.
union.ic.ac.uk/rag, for any
more minor updates.
