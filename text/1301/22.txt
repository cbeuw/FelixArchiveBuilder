Horror movies are a fine art. Many
have failed because the audience
are disappointed unless they’re
scared witless and go home with the
fear of God in them. The problem
with horror movies is they are an
intrinsically personal entity. What
might petrify and paralyse one man,
another would scoff and sneer at. So
let me enlighten you: Saw terrified
me to the very core. Yet, watching it
was bordering on enjoyable – I can
never understand why people don’t
like a good horror movie. Maybe it’s
just the sadomasochist in me speak-
ing, but I love being frightened.
I’m not afraid to admit that I actu-
ally screamed at one point during
this movie, something I have never
experienced before (so don’t start
making judgments about me yet).
Watch the movie, and if you don’t
jump, you’ll deserve a medal. To
capture the imagination and atten-
tion of an audience as well as Saw
does is unique.
A good horror film is a rare treat.
Touted as the best horror movie
since The Blair Witch Project, Saw
is a disturbing yet meaningful movie.
One of the most fiendishly inventive
thrillers for a long time, it is a trou-
bling and violent film that merrily
plays with your mind as it twists and
turns through its tricky and menac-
ing plot.
Saw tells the story of two men,
Adam (Leigh Whannell) and
Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who mys-
teriously awaken in a dilapidated
bathroom, both chained by the ankle
to steel pipes from which there is
virtually no chance of escape, with
a blood-soaked body between them.
Neither man knows how or why they
are in this situation. To say any more
would be an injustice to the film.
Saw has some horrifically imagi-
native deaths and a filthy, soiled
appearance that is comparable to
Se7en. The structure of the movie
consists of flashbacks that work fan-
tastically well in keeping you puz-
zled and guessing. When the truth
is revealed and all the pieces start
falling into place, the film becomes
enthralling and riveting. To say that
you could not tear your eyes from
the screen would be an understate-
ment. To say that you would be
on the edge of your seat would be
an understatement. No matter how
horrific or gruesome the scene, your
sheer curiosity carries you through
the movie.
Cinematography and soundtrack
work in harmony to generate a bona
fide sense of claustrophobia and
disorientation. The tension really is
tangible at times; the silence of an
audience can be deafening. The cos-
tume of the villain is one of the most
unsettling elements to the movie,
and not since Stephen King’s It have
I been so unnerved by a simple
costume. Cleverly, first time direc-
tor Wan leaves a lot to the imagi-
nation, leaving your imagination to
run riot.
Saw isn’t without its flaws
though. Whannell, who is also the
screenwriter, is average at best.
His performance at times is laugh-
able, especially in the emotionally
charged scenes. The same can be
said of Elwes. Their lack of talent
is a real shame in such a cleverly
devised movie. The supporting cast,
Glover and Leung, are steady and
dependable, if not amazing.
Foregoing the supernatural for a
more realistic serial killer protago-
nist, this is the kind of horror film
that is really chilling. It will stick
long in the memory, no matter how
hard you try to forget it. Brilliantly
terrifying, yet masterfully intelligent
and original, Saw is a rare breed of
movie.

How much blood would you shed to stay alive?
Layers of fun? Or not, as the case may be...
Get Carter. The Long Good Friday.
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels. Snatch. What does this
tell you about the British gangster
movie? That there are already far
too many of them? Yes, perhaps.
Or that they’re good, so let’s have
some more. That must have been
Matthew Vaughn’s reasoning before
he decided to direct Layer Cake.
As described in its awful trailer
(involving a pompous cookery show
presenter listing all the different
‘ingredients’ that make a good gang-
ster movie), Layer Cake promises
a heaped tablespoon of violence,
chopped up film-making, a dollop
of swearing, and a pinch of sex – all
served in a piquant cockney accent.
Suffice to say I expected a generi-
cally modified Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels clone.
The plot surrounds, in no par-
ticular order, a nameless London
cocaine dealer, a Yugoslavian neo-
Nazi sect, a bunch of incompetent
cockney gangsters, the missing
daughter of a rich English aristo-
crat, five million pounds worth of
ecstasy, and a hired killer by the
name of Dragan who specialises in
decapitations.
Prepare to be slightly under-
whelmed by the acting, which lacks
the vitality and rawness of the cast
of Lock, Stock. Layer Cake stars
Daniel Craig (The Power of One,
Tomb Raider) as ‘X’, the hero of our
story. It also stars Dexter Fletcher
(Gamesmaster presenter, and also
from Lock, Stock) and Shakesperian
actor Michael Gambon (Gosford
Park) as a wealthy, violent aristo-
crat.
The director, Michael Vaughn, was
the producer behind Lock, Stock and
Snatch. Unfortunately, what Vaughn
fails to understand this time is that
you can’t have your Layer Cake and
eat it. The reason why the afore-
mentioned gangster films were suc-
cessful is because they were original
and they did something different.
That is what led to the revival of the
entire genre. However, Layer Cake,
as demonstrated by the trailer, is
a very conscious attempt to latch
onto the tail end of our forgotten
fascination with hyper-violence and
criminal Londoners who compul-
sively break the rules.
Guy Ritchie made Snatch and
Lock, Stock look like a piece of
cake. But Layer Cake is laboured,
tedious and self-conscious. Unlike
Jason Stretham, the verbally agile
and convincing star of Lock, Stock,
Daniel Craig looks like a constipated
Gordon Tracy from Thunderbirds
and sounds like the voiceover from
The Magic Roundabout.
Undeniably, the film has some
moments of entertainment thanks
to some MTV-style hyperkineticism
and moments of belly-chuckling
humour. But from the first scene,
which had shades of Ray Liotta’s
opening speech in Goodfellas, we
are presented with a movie that fails
to serve up something fresh and
original, essentially being a badly
disguised collage of a host of other
gangster films. Every scene has
been done before, every character
portrayed in the recent collective
memory.
So the question is, are the public
sick of seeing British gangster mov-
ies? Have we had enough of cockney
hardmen bowling around shouting
“Listen you muppet, you’re a slag”
and then shooting some poor guy’s
face off? The answer, I think, is yes.
Paradoxically, given its relative-
ly small budget (£4 million) Layer
Cake will inevitably make money.
However, as with Donnie Brasco
which was the last great American
gangster film, Layer Cake marks the
denouement with which the British
gangster movie genre has, finally
and inevitably, been exhausted.
