This year has been a busy
one for the Imperial College
Fencing Club, who came sec-
ond in the league, narrowly
missing out on first place to
Reading. The club fenced at
a high profile event entitled
‘What Price Gold? Should
London Persist in its Bid
to Hold the 2012 Olympic
Games’, held at the Imperial
College Tanaka Business
School for its opening. There
was also success in the BUSA
individuals’ competition
and the University College
International Competition.
This summer, the fencing
club managed to take a small
team to Hong Kong. They
were invited and competed
in the Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology
International Competition.
They were the only team
from Europe and the west –
everyone else had come from
universities in Hong Kong,
Macau and Singapore. The
small squad of five Imperial
students and one from SOAS
decided to compete in as
many events as possible.
The team arrived in Hong
Kong a week before the com-
petition began. This enabled
them to see all the major
sights of the country, from
the Peak, the highest place
on Hong Kong, to the world’s
biggest bronze Buddha. They
went around all the major
museums as well as bars,
clubs, restaurants and shops.
The first day of the competi-
tion saw individual matches
take place. Everyone was
doing both weapons, with
exception of Fabian and Eric
who decided to concentrate
on epée. Admittedly, most of
the team were not amazingly
experienced, having only
been fencing for a year. This
explains why no one brought
home any medals, although
star fencer and president,
Eric Lai, came eighth in epée.
However, everyone enjoyed
the challenge.
That night, some of the
Imperial team went out par-
tying, arriving home at 4am,
giving them only four hours’
sleep before the next day’s
fencing match. However, they
kept on doing well, only nar-
rowingly losing the foil team
match and winning the epée
team match. By the time of
the second epée match, Eric
had arrived, which got the
team’s spirits up. Despite all
their efforts though, they were
defeated by much stronger
opposition.
Attheendofallthematches,
although the Imperial team
didn’t win any medals, they
still received a small gift for
turning up. A good time was
had by all. Meeting and fenc-
ing new people on the other
side of the world has never
been so much fun.
