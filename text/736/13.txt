Mr Van Zoom was doing
the hoovering one day,
when he accidently nudged
a cupboard, dislodging an
egg and a feather which
had been resting on top.
Mr Van Zoom dived to
catch the egg, and just
managed it! He sat down
and wiped his brow. 'Phewi
he thought That was
close'. Meanwhile, the
feather drifted gently to the
ground. Mr Van Zoom
looked at it curiously. 'I
wonder,' he said, 'I wonder
why it is that the egg falls
so much quicker than the
feather?'
'Yes, I wonder' replied
the hoover. Mr Van Zoom
said 'Who could we ask to
explain why the egg falls
faster than the feather?'
Just then, Mr Van Zoom's
dog, Ralph, leapt in.
'RALPH!' he said.
m
'What a good idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom. 'We'll go and
ask the Busy Man. He
always seems to know what
he's talking about'.
So Mr Van Zoom, hoover
and Ralph, went to visit the
Busy Man. He was in his
office writing important
letters. Mr Van Zoom asked
him 'Why does the egg fall
faster than the feather?'
'Don't bother me now!'
said the Busy Man, 'I've got
three thousand telephone
c a l l s to make b e f o r e
lunchtime
'Wow! said hoover.' That
person doesn't have very
much time to spare!'
'Well, that's fair enough I
suppose', thought Mr Van
Zoom.
'But you still don't know
why the egg falls faster
than the feather, do you?'
Said the hoover.
'Well, who can I ask
next?' asked Mr Van Zoom.
'Ralph!' Said Ralph.
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom, and his eyes
lit up eagerly. 'We'll go and
ask the Old Woman. She
has so much experience,
she must be able to help'.
So Mr Van Zoom, hoover
and Ralph went to visit the
Old Woman. She was in her
cottage, spining wool Mr
Van Zoom asked her 'Why
does the egg fall faster
than the feather?'
'Well, now..let me see...'
pondered the Old Woman'
It's something to do with
the Chicken and the
Egg...or something.'
'I don't understand that!'
said Mr Van Zoom. 'What
did you mean?'
'I'm not sure that I know
myself!' replied the old
Woman.
'Wow!' said hoover. That
person believes some
things that don't make
sense!
'Well, that's fair enough I
suppose,' thought Mr Van
Zoom.

'But you still don't know

Said the hoover.
'Well, who can I ask next?'
asked Mr Van Zoom.
'Ralph!' said Ralph.
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom, and his
fingers twitched with
excitement. 'We'll go and
ask the priest. He always
has an answer to
everything!
So Mr Van Zoom, hoover
and Ralph went to visit the
priest. He was in his
chapel, meditating quietly.
Mr Van Zoom asked him
'Why does the egg fall
faster than the feather?'
The Egg & the
leather
A brief and simple story
'Well, that's because God
made the World that way'
said the priest.
'I'm sorry?' asked Mr Van
Zoom.
'You'll know when the
time has come', replied the
priest, calmly.
'I see..' said Mr Van
Zoom, not really seeing at
all.
'Wow!' said the hoover.
'That person seems to
believe some things without
ever asking 'why?'! 'Well,
that's fair enough I
suppose', thought Mr Van
Zoom.
'But you still don't know
why the egg falls faster
than the feather, do you?'
Said the hoover.
'Well, who can I ask
next?' asked Mr Van Zoom.
'Ralph!' said Ralph.
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom, and his ears
tingled with anticipation.
We'll go and ask the
teacher. She's so used to
explaining things she must
be able to help.'
So Mr Van Zoom, hoover
and Ralph went to visit the
teacher. She was in her
classroom, givng a lesson.
'Excuse me', said Mr Van
Zoom, 'But why does the
egg fall faster than the
feather?'
'Hmm! said the teacher.
That's a tricky one! Let me
think for a moment'.
'Ralph!' said Ralph.
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom, and his
knees quivered with
delight. 'While the teacher
is thinking, 'let's ask the
children! they are so
imaginative, they must be
able to help'.
So while the teacher was
thinking Mr Van Zoom
asked the children 'Why
does the egg fall faster
than the feather?'
'It's because the egg is
heavier!' said a girl. Mr Van
Zoom thought for a while,
This sounded a like a really
good explanation, but
before he was willing to
believe it, Mr Van Zoom
decided that he needed
some evidence. 'Can you
explain why it should be,
the egg should fall faster
just because it is heavier?'
He asked.
'Because...well, because
heavy things always fall
faster!' replied the girl,
looking a little doubtful.
'Hmmm...' said Mr Van
Zoom, still not quite
convinced.
'Wow!' said hoover. That
person seems to have some
really good ideas to explain
things but can't prove them
one way or the other!'
Meanwhile the teacher
had finished thinking. 'I
couldn't be sure of the
answer myself she said to
Mr Van Zoom, 'but I can
tell you who would know!
You'll have to ask the
scientist!'
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom, and his nose
itched with enthusiasm.
'We'll go and ask the
scientist. All those
experiments of his must
have some use or other!'
So Mr Van Zoom, hoover
and Ralph went to visit the
scientist. He was in his
laboratory, writing
equations. 'Why does the
egg fall faster than the
feather?' asked Mr Van
Zoom.
