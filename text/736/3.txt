Why Nightline
Must Survive
Dear Hugh
It was with dismay that I
read your report last week
concerning the very real
threat to the 'Nightline'
service. Apparently,
Nightline's running costs
are excessive for the
number of calls received
and few callers are suicidal.
How many desperate
students does it take to
convince College and the
involved unions that this is
an essential service whose

Nightline: It's value should
never be underestimated.
value should never be
underestimated? There are
pressures enough from
college life: the withdrawal
of a service which could be
a student's only ecsape
from a sense of total
isolation is unthinkable,
especially on the grounds
of funding alone.
As long as there are
volunteers willing to train
and subsequently donate
their time and energy to
manning the Nightline
office it must stay open.
The valuable information
service is an asset to all
students, but in this case it
is imperative that the
minority's needs are
provided for; it would be a
tradgedy that this college
in particular can ill afford if
Nightline were to close.
Yours faithfully,
Sue Whittaker

Taig It Away...
Dear FELIX,
I am glad that Penny
Ottway is quite content
with the mixture of
students that make up
Imperial College and I am
sure that plenty of others
feel the same way. I do
wish that this was true of
all students—but
unfortunately it is not. The
vast majority of those
students who bothered to
turn up to the relevant
U G M saw the Dreaded
Ratio as enough of a
problem to necessitate the
post of Women's Officer;
not one spoke against the
idea on the grounds that
there is no problem. From
the response I have had
from many students (and
staff) both female and male
since then I am sure that
most people agree that IC
would be a happier place
with a few more women
around.
As I volunteered to do
the job of Women's Officer,
of course I have mentioned
The Ratio on several
occasions. This does not
mean that I (or those who
agree with me) spend all
my time weeping and
wailing over the issue—I
simply believe that
reasonable, positive action
is better than ignoring
problems (however
important you consider
them to be) in the hope
that they will go away.
Finally, I trust that Penny
will be amongst the first to
volunteer to visit her old
School at College's
expense to encourage
other schoolgirls to come
to IC, as mentioned in last
week's FELIX.
Yours,
Christine Taig
Women's Officer!
Good Old Opsoc
Dear Sir,
I wish to congratulate
Imperial College Operatic
Society on reaching the
grand old age of thirty!
Since 1956 its hard-working
members have been giving
enormous pleasure to
audiences here and on
their summer tours to
Budleigh Salterton, Devon.
I have greatly enjoyed their
performances every year
since 1969 and quickly
found that their amateur
,.ioductions had much
more life and sponteneity
than those of the
professional D'Oryly Carte
company
It is astonishing how
much action they cram into
such a small stage, such as
the triple sword fight in the
current Princess Ida. The
imaginative sets (eg
Yeoman of the Guard,
1983) , colourful costumes
(eg lolanthe, 1973 and
1984) and original
Opsoc's most recent show
productions, such as the
cleverly updated Grand
Duke, 1985, are a delight.
The acting and dancing are
very lively, both for the
chorus and the soloists.
Singing quality is
somewhat variable, with the
ladies frequently better
than the men, but the very
spirited performances often
compensate for occasional
lack of vocal finesse.
Certain soloists (especially
females) have been of
professional standard and
training, making it harder
for indigenous talent to
show'well, but some
College members have
been outstandingly good.
The company obviously
inspires loyalty, with
singers, directors and
musicians taking part many
years after leaving Imperial
College.
My all-time favourite is
the 1976 Utopia Limited,
where the superbly funny
Christo Minstrel scene was
encOred many times. IC
Opsoc has been
particularly good at giving
audiences a chance to see
rarer, 'less commercial'
operettas, such as the
Sorcerer, Princess Ida, the
Grand Duke, and Utopia
Limited. They have
performed works by Gilbert
and Sullivan, Offenbach,
and others, always with
great style and entusiasm.
Long may they continue to
give up so much of their
spare time to enrich the life
of the College.
Congratulations Opsoc!
Yours sincerely,
Dr B Lamb
