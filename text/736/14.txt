'It's because of air
resistance!' Replied the
scientist knowledgably.
'I beg your pardon!' said
Mr Van Zoom. 'What does
that mean?'
'It's because the air is in
between the egg, the
feather and the ground. It's
all around in fact. When
they fall to the ground, they
have to push the air out of
the way. The egg can do
that more easily because of
its streamlined shape'.
Mr Van Zoom thought for
a while.
This sounded like a bit of
a hoax, to him. Much too
complicated. Mr Van Zoom
decided he would definitely
need some evidence. 'Can
you show me why it should
be, that the egg falls faster,
just because of "air
resistance"?' he asked.
'Yes, I believe I can,'
replied the scientist. 'Can I
borrow your hoover for a
minute?'
'Certainly' replied Mr Van
Zoom 'Especially if this will
explain to me why the egg
falls faster than the feather'.
'Oh, it will, it will,' replied
the scientist. He fished out
a big glass tube with a
wooden platform inside it.
He balanced an egg and a
feather on the plaftorm.
'Just like on top of my
cupboard back at home'
thought Mr Van Zoom,
'only inside that big glass
tank'.
Then the scientist put
hoover over the top of the
glass tube, and switched
him on. Hoover sucked
harder and harder until he
couldn't suck any more.
'What on Earth is he
doing?' wondered Mr Van
Zoom.
'Now' said the scientist. '
We have sucked all the air
out of the tube. If there is
no air, there will be no air
resistance, so the egg and
the feather should now fall
at the some rate'. And with
a flourish, he flipped the
plaform so that the egg and
the feather fell. Mr Van
Zooms eyes got wider and
wider as he watched the
feather fall quickly down
the tube-at exactly the
same speed! 'And if we now
let the air back in' he
continued, removing
hoover from the top of the
glass tube, 'The egg and
the feather will fall at
different rats just as
before'.
'Wow!' said hoover 'That's
so crazy its got to be true!'
'Besides', said Mr Van
Zoom,' we saw it with our
own eyes.'
'Ralph!' said Ralph.
'I think,' said Mr Van
Zoom, I think I would like
to be a scientist—just for a
short time, just to know
what it is like'.
The scientist replied 'I
think that if you look you
will find that you already
are a scientist'.
'Hmm...' said Mr Van
Zoom, doubtfully. 'I'll think
about that'.
'Ralph!' said Ralph.
'That's a great idea!' said
Mr Van Zoom. 'Let's go
back home and finish the
hoovering.

Sailing Athletics
IC 7 Oxford 1
After a lapse of sailing for
several weeks due to frozen
reservoirs, Captain Mc
Lowe turned towards the
team, each member
anxiously waiting to hear
whether they would be
sailing.
'It's on', he muttered. We
all knew what this meant. It
meant that Oxford had
accepted our challenge. It
meant that Farmoor
reservoir was defrosting.
And it meant we could have
to miss a day at the bar in
the Dinghy Exhibition.
So on Saturday the team
travelled to Oxford to do
what was necessary.
Five races were sailed
before lunch, which
resulted in 4 clear wins,
despite Ape's nerve-racking
attempts to start late...
The 3 afternoon races
were much closer fought,
with much place changing
occuring, though IC's
superior team racing tactics
ensured that the team
always ended in a winning
combination
The undeniable hero of
the day was Daniel, who
despite his limited
experience as a helm,
saved the last race by
slowing Oxford enough for
the rest of the team to sail
to a 1-2-3 victory
A very enjoyable day was
had by all, finishing with a
hearty meal of bangers n'
mash at Tony and Celia's
flat.
Rifle
Rifle Inter C C U fullbore rifle
competition
RCS 328, RSM 314, C & G 292
RCS won the annual full
bore rifle match held at
Bisley last Sunday. This
was despite the absence of
two key team members.
Competition from the
RSM and C & G teams was
fierce and the result was
close. The highest scorer
was an Irishman who shot
for the RSM team. (This
was unsurprising since he
is also a member of the
Irish National Squad). The
fact that he wore a
Manchester University
sweatshirt made his
inclusion in the RSM Team
rather dubious.
The R C S victory means
that it is the overall winner of
the Inter C C U rifle and pistol
competition both on points
and number of matches won.
On the first Wednesday of
the Summer Term, 23rd
April, IC Sports Day is to
be held at Motspur Park in j
Surrey. Here is a summary
of the essential details.

The programme will
include all athletics track
events from 100m up to'
3000m and all field events-

trophies for some events.
Further, there will be some
'fun' events including 'The
Peeled Banana Medley
Relay' 'Piggy Back Relays'

Legged Egg and Spoon
Race.'

interested should get in
touch with their CCU's
'Sport Day Representative'
or John Pope, Athletics
Secretary for the Cross-
