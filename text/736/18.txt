U A U Quarter-final
Last Sunday saw an
understrength IC team
head towards the wind and
rain of Durham.
Packed into two cars, the
team of six made their
independent way north
finally meeting up in
Cleveland, despite
completely missing a
rendezvous point and a
I close look at Leeds.
Upon meeting, the
; convoy headed north to the
'Nicky Nack' in Crosdale,
infamous for its lack of
| most things, including
i decent accommodation.
Onto the match. The
i morning foursomes proved
I to be IC's down fall. In the
top match, Dave Tierney
and Jon Gamblin managed
to overcome come erratic
play to force a half. Mark
as and the powerful
postgrad went down on the
18 despite some
j inspirational putting by the
| former. Chris Harrison and
Imperial win Rugby Gutteridge Cup
(see front page)
Huw Jones could do little
in the final match against
an in-form pair.
No more luck for IC in
the afternoon. An out of
form Mark Cas could do
little against an in practise
opponent, and Dave
Tierney, Chris Harrison and
the powerful postgrad
failed in their attempt to
beat the course and their
opponents.
The best win of the day
came from Huw Jones,
playing the only female
member of the Durham
team despite some
persistent hooking into the
bushes, he managed to
score well and slipped in
from behind, almost holing
in one in the process. A
further chink of light was
provided by Jon Gamblin
who managed to gravel a
win on the last green.
Rugby
IC 32 K Q C 3
This proved to be the first
leg of two impressive
victories for IC within three
days of each other.
IC took a little while to
settle into this game and
they allowed King's far too
much room outside the
scrum for a couple of
penetrating back moves,
which almost resulted in
tries. But once the IC
forwards woke up to the
task and began to feed the
talented back line the result
was never in doubt. First
half tries came from
Hutchinson and Secombe,
Hutchinson in particular
working the blind side to
good effect.
In the second half,
although with a breeze
against them, IC despite
scrappy handling at times,
continued to move the ball
wide and support
effectively. Folland crossed
twice and Anderson carved
out a peach of a break of a
break to nip over under the
posts.
IC 55 London Welsh 10
Although IC were up
against a larger pack in
most quarters, they played
with determination and a
controlled aggression
which surprised the
opposition and found them
reeling early in the game. It
was a feast of running
rugby and everyone wanted
a nibble! Tremendous
support play was the key to
ICs resounding victory
which consisted of nine
tries-eight converted, and
one penalty goal. The try
scorers included, the
'Blonde Bombshell,' Parker'
(3), Paul Seccombe (7),
Boogie Woogie Goetz (27)
Rob 'Voracious' Hargrove,
and the Irish leprechaun,
Mike Anderson.
Ladies Hockey
ULU Plate Final
| Ladies hockey, tired and
' hungover as they were after
| the previous evenings
Annual Dinner, played at
Motspur park on Sunday
I morning in the U L U plate
final. Our opponents were
Wye College, who have
already beaten us this
season in a friendly.
However, on Sunday the
teams were evenly matched
so much so that the score
at fulltime was 0-0. We had
a short break, during which
we were supplied with
drinks by our supporters-
some of the less ill
Sarah Hodgson neatly slotting home Imperials winning goal
members of the men's team
after the previous night! We
then went on to play an
extra 15 minutes each way,
in the last 10 minutes of
which Sarah Hodgson (see
pic), scored an excellent
winning goal.
Many thanks to all our
supporters who cheered us
on to our victory and
refreshed us at the
intervals, particularly to Jon
Stonham (one of the illest
people at the dinner the
night before) who got out
of his sick bed to umpire.
On Wednesday, Ladies
hockey will play Charing X
in their last match of the
season. If we win, we will
have won the 2nd division.
If not, it will have to be
worked out on goal
difference but we will
definitely be promoted to
the first division next
season.
Team: Elaine Harper
