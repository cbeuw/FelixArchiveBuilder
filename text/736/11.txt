The Future of Higher Education
The future of Higher
Education has now become
the subject of detailed
discussion following the
publication of the
Government's Green paper
'The Development of
Higher Education in the
1990s'. The proposals in
this document are designed
to enable a higher
proportion of young people
to go on to universities and
polytechnics; to provide the
country with more
graduates in science and
engineering; and to
encourage more private
sources of finance for
higher education.
The A U T , committee of
Vice-Chancellers and
Principals, and U G C have
all foretold 'chaos',
expressed 'grave concern'
and speak of 'irreparable
damage'. The story they tell
is of how 'The golden age
of university expansion was
turned into the dark age at
the stroke of a pen'. The
facts can be briefly told.
Over the next five years,
the unvisersites are likely to
lose ten per cent of their
income from the
government. The
polytechnics and big public
sector colleges will be
required to teach more
students with the same
resources. A shift from
costly university to
practical polys against a
background of economic
decline and a drastic fall in
the number of 18-19 year
olds has already occured.
The AUT's interest is
clear: they are strictly self-
serving. The vice-
chancellors have called
'Wolf!' so often that they
cannot be take seriously.
The U G C only speaks of 'A
defeatist approach'. The
factors are clearly
explained by demography.
A sharp decline in the
birth-rate for the 60s
onwards will result in a 33%
fall in the number of 18-19
year olds in the population
between 1984 and 1996.
Further, two decades of
unprecedeted expansion
post-Robbins have led to
an inefficienet unproductive
system:
'To pretend that the effect
of 20 years of only loosely
controlled development has
left us with the best of all
possible systems, needing
only constant injection of
money to keep it in perfect
condition, would be a
mistake'
Sir Keith Joseph
The Vice-Chancellors reply
to the Green Paper
declared that 'any greater
emphasis on science and
technology will become
impossible without wilful
damage to other necessary
sections of the university
community...', but a third
class polytechnic electrical
engineering is more likely
to find a job than a first
class university
sociologist, english, history,
art and design, psychology
and sociology graduates
have higher unemployment
rate than the National
Average. Are we to ignore
these figures?
The A U T claim that
reduced government
spending will mean that
Higher Education will be
years of 'savage cuts' there
are more students in higher
education than ever before
and 60 000 more than in
1979, and even after the
substantial fall in student
numbers in the 1990s, their
will still be places for a
higher proportion of young
people than their were 5
years ago. Sir Keith Joseph
has challenged the
profession to provide
examples of the
'widespread and
irrepairable damage' that is
allegedly ocurring,
providing to fight for more
money from the Treasury if
their case is convincing.
Sir Ke'ith Joseph: Higher Education is vital.
reserved for the privileged
elite', But hasn't it always?
The proportion of working
class students gaining
university places FELL
during the post-Robbins
expansion era.
They have also
reinterpreted Robbins: the
famous 1963 report stated:
'That courses of Higher
Education should be
available for all those who
are qualified by ability and
attainment to pursue them
and wish to do so'. It now
states courses of Higher
Education should be
available to all those who
can benefit from them and
wish to do so. Now they
want more places available
so that more students will
be available to them
E X C E P T curiously in
engineering, science and
technology whose 'demand
must come first'. The
government accept this
reform , but in order to
maintain high academic
standards it is insisting that
institutions apply rigorous
selection procedures.
It has occured to the
government that the
nations demand for
graduates may not decline
by 33% just because the
birth rate has.
Inconsequence the Green
Paper proposes a reduction
in student numbers by the
mid 1990s of only 13%. The
figures show that after five
'The government believes
that it is vital for Higher
Education to contribute
more effectively to the
improvement of the
performance of the
economy...'
Sir Keith Joseph
Continued economic
recovery will be impeded if
institutions of Higher
Education fail to provide
more graduates in skills in
the subjects—such as
science, engineering and
technology—that industry
needs. Here it is to be
central objective of the
governments Higher
Education policy to secure
a major shift from the arts
to science and technology.
The number of engineering
students has already
increased from 27000 in
1979 to 40000 n 1984, and
additional reseources are
being provided to create an
additional 400 places. The
percentage of graduates
qualifed in engingeering
and science will rise from
33% in 1979-80 to 47% in
1989-90. Only by forging
lines between higher
education and graduate
employers can the role of
higher education and the
needs of the ecomony be
brought into line.
Since rigorous arts
courses provide an
excellent preparation for
jobs which carry
responsiblity and are
personaly and intellectually
demanding, the number of
places in arts subjects will
only fall slightly and will be
concentrated in
universities.
Research
The total research budget
available to universities haj
risen in real terms since
1979. Expenditure on
science has risen by 8% in
real terms over the same
period and there will be no
reduction in Governments
contribution over the
coming years. The mutal
advantages to both industry
and universities is closer
colaboration over research
not being exploited to their
full potential. Through
some collaboration
universities gain additional
funds. Perhaps if we refuse
to participate in defence
research projects such as
SDI, our department are
not worthy to remain open,
as they attempt to take
political decision on behalf
of us all.
Finance
The number of higher
education institutions has
expanded since Robbins to
accommodate the extra
demand for places. No less
than 80% of the resources
required for our universities
comes from the taxpayer.
Industry and commerce
must increase their
contributions substantially
in line with our Western
competitors to make the
proportion equate to 75%
from U G C . The government
has pledged that whatever
they get from private
benefactors, higher
education institutions can
keep—it will not be
deducted from their
recurrent grants.
The government does not
attempt to hide it's
education policy. It's
planning is immaculate,
and it's projected future in
line with economic growth
and rejuvenation.
Conservatives do not wish
to be blamed for dealing
with deep-rooted
problems—they're proud of
it. On the rare occasions
when they've got it wrong,
think of the achievements
of Dr Owen, Mrs Williams
and Mr Callaghan, and the
mistakes pale in to
insignicance
