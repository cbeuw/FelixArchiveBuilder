Recently I have been
thinking that death might
be a refreshing change. No
more of this running
around trying to help
people who don't care
whether or not you help
them. No more trying to
improve things that people
will hate you for improving.
No more loving or hating.
No more tears.
'All the world's a stage
and all the men and women
merely players.'
True, but how much
better must it be to sit back
and watch the players
suffer pain sorrow and joy
knowing that you will
remain unaffected as the
final curtain slides down.
Wondering, perhaps, how
many of the characters who
had graced the stage just
seconds earlier had eagerly
anticipated the end of the
show, their destruction. Or
even the number who had
left early, who had chosen
not to stay to the end. To
the watcher their suicides
would be irrelevant —
detracting little or nothing
from the overall
performance, although the
other players might have to
work around the gap,
devising new cues to cover
up for the loss.
Theatre is, for me at
least, the most exiting and
terrifying art form. A good
play will attack the
audience like a warrior with
the flat of his broadsword,
leaving the audience
breathless, worried and a
bit dazed, but not seriously
wounded. The theatre-goer
is always free to leave.
There is no obligation to
see a play through. Trying
to leave real life is rather
more difficult, although
suicide does seem to be
getting fashionable.
Perhaps, like me, you
find that theatre puts you in
that enviable position of the
observer. Relief to one's
own life, even if only
briefly. Perhaps the follies
of other people's minds,
once out in the open, will
soothe the memory of the
follies of your own. Relax. I
don't want to die.
When reccommending
theatre at the moment, one
is quite tempted to give the
general advice.'Go to the
National'. At the moment
there are two shows at the
National Theatre that I'm
dying to see. The first, in
the Olivier, is BrecM's
Threepenny Opera, starring
Tim Curry as Mack the
Knife. Many of you will
remember Mr Curry as the
unforgettably sexy Frank N
Furter from the film of The
Rocky Horror Show. Bertolt
Brecht is one of my favorite
FELIX
playwrights as he is
progressive, direct, and is
occasionally as fatalistic as
I am becoming.
Threepenny Opera was a
collaboration between
Brecht and Kurt Weill —
should definitely be a show
to put a little zest in your
life.
Brighton Beach Memoirs,
at the Cottesloe this time,
is written by another of the
best of the modern
playwrights. Nell Simon is
the man who wrote The
Odd Couple, The Goodbye
Girl, and Barefoot In the
Park, among others. This
play is largely
autobiographical, set at
Brighton Beach, New York,
and concerning a Jewish-
American teenage boy
growing up in 1937.
Frances de la Tour plays
the obligatory Jewish
mother, and very nicely too
I understand. The got rave
reviews in the States, and
should travel very well.
Most Neil Simon plays do.
Bill Bryden, the famous
Scottish dramatist, has
directed this one... yet
another reason for it to be
worth missing Dynasty for.
Another American play in
London at the moment is
Glengarry Glen Ross.
Probably best to stay away
from this one if you're as
depressed as I am. A
Broadway hit, this play, by
David Mamet, takes a hard
look at the dog-eat-dog
world of the business man.
This is an NT production
but is now playing at the
Mermaid Theatre SE1.
Enjoy.
The next show that I am
yearning to see is The J
Apple Cart by that most
Irish of gentlemen, George
Bernard Shaw. This play
concerns a king's fight to
keep his throne under
rather unusual, but
certainly not revolutionary, j
circumstances. The king is I
played by Pefer O'Toole,
who heads a cast of some
of the most respected
names in theatre, including
Susannah York, who plays
his powerful mistress. This j
is one of those plays that
leaves you with quite a bit
to think about. Presently
playing at the Haymarket
Theatre SW1.
Lastly, a show that will
leave you thinking about
absolutely nothing of any
importance, but will amuse
you nonetheless. Noel
Coward has never been
reknowned for his gravity.
His play Blithe Spirit is no
exception to this rule and is
as witty and sharp as you
would expect from such a
man. It has as its television- j
famous stars Simon Cadell, i
Joanna Lumley and Jane
Asher who have Hl-de-hl,
The New Avengers, and
some Agatha Christies to
their respective credits.
Good entertainment value,
as long as you're not
looking for any meat. Blithe
Spirit is playing at the
Vaudeville Theatre, WC2.
The unfortunate thing
about theatre is that one
always has to leave at the
end. Ones life, problems,
impending decisions,and
heartaches, all return within
a few minutes. If you are
separated from your loved
one, anxious about an
exam or short of money,
the play can only act as a
temporary distraction. But
then it is interesting to
think that one might only
be leaving one theatre to
act in a larger one. The
same tradgedies, dramas
and farces take place
outside, just on a more
frightening scale. I can
offer nothing but empathy,
guilt anger, and love to this
world. Let the curtain fall,
but not quite yet.
