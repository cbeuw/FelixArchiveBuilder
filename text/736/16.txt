The FELIX guide to what you should be claiming this holiday.
Claiming Benefits over the
Easter Vacation
It is now time to think
about claiming money over
the Easter vacation. This
article is designed to give
you an idea of what you
can claim and how to do it!
If you find yourself
confused or in difficulties
then call into Student
Services and see Lesley,
the Welfare Adviser.
Undergraduate Students
The Undergraduate student
grant contains an element
of £27.50 pw to cover your
living expenses during the
Easter vacation. Unlike
term-time, there is no
element included in the
grant for rent over these
periods. If you have to pay
rent during the vacations,
you are entitled to claim
the money back.
Postgraduate Students
Postgraduate grants
contain living and rent
elements for 52 weeks of
the year and therefore
postgraduate students have
no extra eligibility for
benefits over the vacation.
Which Method Should You
Use
a) Staying in London: there
are two methods of
claiming rent money back,
the one to use depends
partly on whether you
intend to remain at your
term-time address over the
Christmas period. The
fastest and most efficient
way to get the maximum
amount, if you are eligible,
is to 'sign on' as
unemployed with the
Department of Social
Security, the DHSS. For
payments from the DHSS,
Certificated Housing
Benefit, you need to be in
London throughout the
vacation period, be
classified as a householder
and be available for work in
the area you live in.
b) Going home: However, for
those who do not want to
remain in London over the
Easter break but still have to
pay rent for a term-time
address you can still claim
the money back through
Standard Housing Benefit.
c) If you have ever been
employed: In addition to
Housing Benefit those who
have been employed in the
relevant tax year, see the
next section, you may be .
entitled to Unemployment
Benefit.
How to Claim And What To
Claim:
Unemployment Benefit
Who is eligible: Anyone
who has paid or been
credited with National
Insurance contributions on
earnings of at least £1767
in the tax year 1984/85.
To claim: Go to your local
Unemployment Benefit
Office on the first weekday
of the vacation and 'sign
on' as unemployed and
available for work. They
will need proof of your
identity and will need to
know your National
Insurance number. As
Unemployment Benefit is
not dependent on income
but on eligibility it does not
matter that you receive a
small sum from the LEA ie
your grant. This will not
effect the amount you will
receive.
It is worth noting that
Unemployment Benefit can
be claimed from any
Unemployment Benefit
Office in the area you
happen to be staying at
when you become eligible.
If you are claiming
Unemployment Benefit you
should be able to claim
Standard Housing Benefit.
Staying in London
Certificated Housing Benefit
This form of Housing
Benefit is only available to
those about to 'sign on' as
unemployed and available
for work in the area in
which they are paying rent.
It is also dependent on
your eligibility for
supplementary benefit. You
will not receive Certificated
Housing Benefit if you are
receiving Unemployment
Benefit.
To claim: Go to the local
Unemployment Benefit
Office on the first week day
of the vacation and 'sign
on' as unemployed and
available for work. If you
are not eligible for
Unemployment Benefit
your papers will
automatically be forwarded
to the local DHSS. The
Unemployment Benefit
Office will tell you if and
whan they want you to
'sign on' again and will give
you form B1 to take or
send to your local DHSS
office. The DHSS may call
you for an interview and
will need proof of identity
and of your financial
situation ie recent bank
statement etc. The DHSS
will pay a basic living
allowance and will
authorize the local Housing
Authority to pay
Certificated Housing
Benefit. The Housing
Authority will send out
forms to be completed, to
be returned with proof of
rent and rates. Payments of
Certificated Housing
Benefit are considered a
priority and should be
processed within the
fourteen days though they
rarely are. The main
disadvantage of the
Certificated Housing
Benefit system is its
dependence on eligibility
for Supplementary Benefit
which excludes a large
proportion of students.
Who will qualifty: Students
not receiving grants should
qualify. Other students will
have to rely on the
possibility of being classed
as a 'householder' by the
DHSS. There are three
types of Supplementary
Benefit—householder, joint
householder and own-
householder. A
householder is defined as
someone who is soley
responsible for meeting all
the costs of their
'household' and they will
receive a slightly higher
rate of Supplementary
Benefit.
Non-Householder Most
students livng with a
landlady/landlord will be
classed as non-
householders and as the
living element in the grant
is a slightly higher amount
than the non-householder
rate, you will not qualify for
Supplementary Benefit and
will not be eligible for
Certificated Housing
Benefit.
Joint Householder:
Students sharing flats will
be classed as joint
householders.
Unfortunately, you will not
be able to receive
Supplementary Benefit as
the living element in the
grant is a slightly higher
amount than the joint
householder rate, therefore
you will not receive
Certificated Housing
Benefit.
Householder: However,
some students livng in
individual bedsits may be
classed as 'householders'
and as the student vacation
element is lower than the
'householder' rate you
should be eligible for a
small weekly sum from the
DHSS and in these cases
the DHSS will authorise
payment of Certificate
Housing Benefit.
The term 'Householder' is
loose and ill-defined and
open to appeal but
obviously the D H S S Will
seek to classify students as
non-householder if
possible.
Housing Benefit
Supplement
If you do not qualify for
Supplementary Benefit, the
DHSS should still make an
assessment for Housing
Benefit Supplement. They
will send you a standard
Housing Benefit claim form
to send to the local
Housing Authority but it
will be marked with an
'excess income figure'
which in the long term will
provide you with slightly
more benefit than if you
approached the Housing
Authority direct.
What to claim if you are
leaving London for the
vacation.
Standard Housing Benefit
Some of you will
hopefully already have
submitted claims for
Housing Benefit during
term-time. During the
Easter vacation your official
income drops to £27.50pw
and there is no rent
element included in this
sum, so if you claim
standard Housing Benefit
over the vacation you will
receive considerably more
than term-time. Students
who were not eligile in
term-time using this
system, should be eligible
for some money back in
the vacation due to the
drop in inome. This benefit
doesn't involve any 'signing
on' and can be paid even if
you are not resident in your
term-time address over the
vacation.
To claim-if you have
already submitted a claim
in term-time:
In theory if you have
already submitted a claim,
stating term dates you
should automatically be
reassessed. In practise this
rarely happens. It is wise to
write to the Housing
Benefit Office and state
that it is now vacation time
and that as your weekly
income is only £27.50pw
you wish to have your
Housing Benefit reeassed
for the period 22nd March-
20th April 1986. Also inform
them that you will not be
working over the vacation.
They will send you a
declaration to this effect,
for you to sign. Students
who have already claimed
in term-time to
Hammersmith and Fulham
should call into the Student
(continued on next page)
