St Thomas' Gutted
Imperial College won the
Gutterldge Cup for Rugby
Union on Saturday. The
Gutterldge Cup Is open to all
the Colleges in London
University. In the final they beat
St Thomas's Hospital 12-9.
IC scored first when Paul
Seccombe gathered the broken
ball and jinked through the St
Thomas's forwards. This
enabled Owen Miles to wriggle
free and score in the corner.
Neil Folland converted the try.
IC took a twelve-nil lead when
just before half-time Hutchinson
broke blind and fed Seccombe
who beat one man and kicked
ahead over the remaining
defence. It was a sixty yard
chase which Seccombe won to
touch down inches inside the
dead ball line. Folland again
converted.
After half-time IC should have
sewn up the game had they
been able to turn pressure into
points. Unfortunately St
Thomas's managed to rally and
IC Rugby 1st XV
scored a late try in the corner
and a penalty to bring the score
twelve points to nine. The last
five minutes saw some frantic
defence from IC but IC's
determination and commitment
paid off and they managed to
hold on.
Beit Alight
Fire broke out in the basement
of the Biology Department last
Tuesday. Residents of Beit Hall
Old hostel were evacuated
when fire officers ordered the
whole of the west side of Beit
Quad to be cleared. College fire
officer Bob Foggon has
estimated the cost of damage at
around £4,000.
The fire was discovered at
10.30pm by Dr Selkirk who was
working late in the department.
Firemen were on the scene
within ten minutes of the alarm
being raised, and the blaze was
rapidly brought under control.
Beit Hall residents left their
rooms when the alarm bells
were first sounded, but re-
entered the building when the
alarm ceased to ring. On
discovering this, the senior fire
officer informed ICU Deputy
President Dave Kingston that
there was still a 'bio hazard' and
the Old Hostel had to be
cleared again.
The fire was located in a lean-
to on the west side of the
department's parisitology unit.
Mr Foggon told FELIX that the
suspected cause of the fire was
an electrical fault in a freezer.
Bags of sawdust which were
stacked around the freezer were
set alight as was the casing of
the freezer. The fire spread to
some plastic carbouys and to
the shed itself. The
department's incinerator was
also severely damaged. Senior
Departmental Superintendent
Roy Adams said that it was
essential to have the incinerator
in working order. He was
hopeful that the College would
provide the £1800 necessary for
its repair.
DOC To
Expand
A new office and laboratory
block is to be constructed for
the Computing Department, at a
cost of approximately £525,000.
The building is expected to be
built in the area between the
bookshop and the Electrical
Engineering building, although
other sites are under
consideration.
The building will liberate
space in the Huxley building,
which in conjuction with the
area formerly occupied by the
Holland Club, will be used to
improve lecture and other
facilities. Work will begin in the
summer, and is expected to be
complete by October 1987.
Nothing
To Say
ICU Deputy President Dave
Kingston and Hon Sec Quentin
Fontana called off Monday's
meeting of Council after
deciding that there was no
business to be discussed. Mr
Kingston said that both he and
Mr Fontana had been under
'extreme pressure' last week,
owing to the absence of
President Carl Burgess, who
was attending the International
Conference of Students of
Science and Technology
(INCOST) in Belguim, and to
Mr Kingston's ULU Presidential
campaign. Mr Fontana had not
received reports from any Union
Officer, and had not had time to
get any minutes written up from
other Union Committees. Mr
Fontana said that very few
officers' reports had been
submitted on time all year, and
that he had 'bugger all to say'.
Mr Kingston and Mr Fontana
contacted Council Chairman
Hugh Stiles who agreed that
Council should be cancelled.
On Monday Internal Services
Chairman Alan Rose collected
several signatures from Council
members who objected to the
cancellation. It was later agreed
that there should be a meeting
of Council on Thursday.
