Student Disillusionment

Student Disillusionment
(including extracts from the
Board of Studies agenda
4.12.85 Paper B: 'A
Response To the Green
Paper').
The Government has
recently produced a 'Green
Paper' delineating their
plans for 'the development
of Higher Education into
the 1990's'. Further
substantial sacrifices to the
end of the decade are
being demanded of
Universities.
The resourcing of Higher
Education has produced a
crisis which will enforce
difficult and painful
decisions by both
government and individual
institutions. It will be a
tragedy for Britain as well
as several generations of
students if these decisions
are taken while relations
remain not merely sour but
hostile.
Funding is decreasing
from the Government. This
is why the A U T went on
strike. With accelerating
technology, the amount of
material to put in a degree
course increases every
year. Lecturers talk faster,
overun more and are often
obliged to skim over
important material. There
are four alternatives to this
uncomfortable situation;
1) Increase the duration of
the courses—but this
requiries extra funding
which is not forthcoming.
(Infact the reverse is true).
2 Reduce the standards of
the degree courses,
damaging our international
reputation and
contravening the Charter
under which the College
was originally set up;
namely for the provision of
'The highest specialized
instruction, and...the fullest
equipment of the most
advanced training and
research in various
branches of sciences,
especially in the application
to industry.
3 Reorganise the courses,
make them more efficient
and improve teaching
standards so that students
can still achieve high
standards without having to
work so hard, or
4 make the students work
harder.
Obviously (unfortunately)
alternative 1 to increase the
duration of the courses is
outside our control.
Alternative 2 to reduce our
standards is to be avoided
at all costs because it
represents a reduction in
the number of well-
educated people in our
society, which is the only
reasonable way to mitigate
power-crazy politicians and
to remain economically
competitive. This leaves us
with 3 and 4 reorganising
and the workload-the
places where we as
students can have real
influence. It is up to us to
help the College and
departments to fulfil 3 as
far as possible by proper
use of staff-student
committees and all other
Academic Affairs.
Obviously we should resist
working harder at all
costs—already we work for
too much of the time.
However when we make a
complaint, we should bear
in mind the alternatives,
which may sometimes
appear so grim as to
counter our demands. In all
cases we should push for
the highest teaching
standards; lecturers should
be trained and given plenty
of feedback. Judging by
the state of R C S , the
College deserves to be
berated for waiting until the
last possible moment
before they have to start
considering revising
courses (rather than just
making us work harder),
but now that they are, the
time is ripe for us to begin
to co-operate more
thoroughly, ft is a chance
for us as students to prove
how useful it is to let us
help decide the future of
the College, an opportunity
which for the sake of all
present and future students
not least of all ourselves
should not be missed. We
must now begin to petition
the College adminstration
to make use of the
responsibility which we are
now ready and able to take,
by enhancing existing
channels of communication
(staff-student committees)
and recognising the vital
role that Academic
Representatives could play
in departmental affairs if
only they had the time. The
College could provide for
this by offering a
humanities course in
'Administration and College
Committee Structure',
towards which credit could
be gained by collecting,
assimilating and presenting
feedback from students at
grass-roots level.
I have made this
proposition to the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee before and will
be restating it on Tuesday
11th March. You are invited
to make criticisms and
suggestions to me on this
and any other idea.

Iran
Author's Name Wit held
This February marked the
seventh anniversary of the
Iranian Revolution. The
revolution rocked the world
and it was a particularly
severe shock for the West.
Since 1979, however, the
media coverage of Iran has
been patchy and erratic.
This has lead to much
confusion and many have
been misled.
Today Iran is a brutal
dictatorship, ruled by a
fanatical mob of religious
despots. Human rights are
non-existent, and all
opposition to the regime
has been systematically
crushed. There have been
thousands of executions
and there are tens of
thousands of political
prisoners. Such indication
of human rights are
common place in many
countries, but what is
'special' about Iran is the
particular brutality of the
Khomeni regime and the
return to the values of the
Fourteenth Century. This is
illustrated by the way
women have been treated.
Women have to cover
every part of their body,
except their eyes, when in
'Ghesas' regulations,
women have been offically
recognised as being
inferior to men; for
example, the evidence of
one man is considered to
have greater weight than
the evidence of two women
in a 'court of law'.
The Iran-Iraq war has so
public. Disobeyed of this
Islamic law would mean a
visit to the local 'Komiteh',
followed by imprisonment
and/or flogging. Women
are not permitted to wear
make-up and it is illegal for
them to be accompanied by
any man except a very
close relative. Furthermore,
under the infamous
far cost the lives of up to
500,000 Iranians, it has
resulted in billions of
dollars of material damage.
Yet the offical slogan in
Iran is still 'War, until
victory'. This victory is
sometimes defined as the
end of the Iraqi regime,
sometimes as the capture
of Jerusalem, and
sometimes as the
destruction of the super
powers. Meanwhile the
killing continues.
The situation in Iran
forced hundreds of
thousands of Iranians into
exile. However, even
outside Iran, the thugs of
the Khomeni regime
continue to harass
members of the opposition.
There have been numerous
examples of unrestrained
physical attacks on exiled
democrats.
At the moment, there is
growing international
opposition to the Khomeni
regime. So much so that
the regime has been forced
back on to the defensive on
human rights issues. It is
important to keep up this
pressure in an organised
manner. It is a policy of
ULU to co-operate with the
organisation of Democratic
Youth and Students of Iran
(ODYSI) and the
Committee for the Defence
of the Iranian People's
Right (CODIR). It is
important to support these
organsations and avoid
separatist or exclusist
actions.
