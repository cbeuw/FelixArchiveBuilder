UGM Blues
Only 70 students attended
the IC Results U G M In the
Great Hall last Thursday.
The dismal turnout was due
in part to the clash with the
Guilds election U G M , held
in Mech Eng 220. U G M
Chairman Chris Hendy
read out a letter of apology
from Guilds President
Roger Preece. Mr Preece
explained that the situation
was unavoidable as Guilds
had been unable to book a
room at any other time.
The main business of the
meeting was the ratification
and election of next year's
non sabbatical Union
Officers. Returned
unopposed were Dan
Phillips (Ents Chairman),
Mark Cottle (External
Affairs Officer), Alan Rose
(Internal Services Officer),
Man Tai Tseung (Rag
Chairman) and Pete Wilson
(Welfare Officer). Mr Rose,
who is currently Internal
Services Committee
Chairman, had proposed a
by-law change such that
the title of his job be
altered. Mr Rose felt that
Union services had
expanded sufficiently for
the post to merit the
standing of a Union Officer,
rather than a chairman of a
subcommittee of ICU
Council. The first reading
of the necessary by-law
changes was accepted
without objection.
Elections were held for
the posts of U G M chairman
and Academic Affairs
Officer. Hugh Southey,
proposed by Grenville
Manuel, was elected as
next year's U G M Chairman.
Mr Southey said that much
more work had to be put
into promoting UGM's, and
that meetings should be
made relevant to ordinary
students. Charles Brereton,
proposed by Alan Rose,
was elected as A A O . Mr
Brereton stressed the need
for more involvement from
Dep Reps in Academic
Affairs.
Earlier in the meeting a
motion reccommending
that the by-laws be altered
so that only women
students be allowed to vote
in the election of the
Women's Officer was
passed without ojection.
The motion, proposed by
ICU President-elect and
current Women's Officer,
Christine Taig, was brought
forward on the agenda
following acceptance of a
prodecural motion.
All of the sabbatical
officers reports were read
by ICU Hon Sec Quentin
Fontana, owing to the
absence of President Carl
Burgess, who was
attending INCOST in .
Belgium, and Deputy
President Dave Kingston
who was busy running his
campaign for U L U
President. There was some
discussion of the College's
proposals for a new
disciplinary procedure.
These include a clause
allowing a student's
punishment to be increased
if he or she appeals against
a decision. IC Union has
made known its objection
to this, though Mr Fontana
pointed out that this clause
exists in the current
disciplinary procedure.
The meeting was closed
before discussion of the
motion on Barclays Bank,
when quorum was
successfully challengd by
John Ransom.

No Blood
For Jackie
Today's R C S blood
donation has been
cancelled. R C S Vice-
President Jackie Peirce
called off the group
donation two weeks ago
when it proved impossible
to find a suitable room. The
organisers had intended to
use the Southside gym for
the donations and had
originally been unable to
come to College before mid
June. Miss Peirce was later
contacted and told that
March 19 was a possible
date due to a cancellation.
Unfortunately she was
unable to book the gym for
the full day on March 19.
Success On
A Plate
Ladies Hockey won the
ULU Plate final on Sunday
at Motspur Park. They beat
Wye College 1-0 after extra
time. The goal was scored
by Sarah Hodgson. A full
report is on the sports
page.
Royle
Winner
Duncan Royle of Elec Eng
3 is the new Guilds
President. Simon Childs
was elected Vice-President
and Ann Driver was
unopposed as Hon Sec.
After a meeting on
Monday the new Executive
issued a statement saying
that they intend to increase
student involvement in
Guilds by making funds
available for students to
organise their own social
events. They also intend to
institute a system of office
hours so that students can
come and see them, and to
make the Guilds Office
more friendly and open.
Members of the new
Executive commented that
next year looked like being
a good year for Guilds and
that they had loads of ideas
for the Union.
The other new members
of Guilds Executive are
Vanessa Palmer, Hugh
Southey, Dave Pugh and
Helen Morgan who are
respectively HJT, A A O ,
Ents Officer and Old
Centralians Rep.
Collection
Complete
A total of £1267 has been
raised for relatives of the
man who was killed in the
Chemistry Department's
pater-noster lift two weeks
ago.
John James of Estates,
who organised the
collection, told FELIX that a
wreath had been sent on
behalf of all the
contributors. He added that
the man's family had
expressed their
appreciation to members of
the College.
Waiting
Appeal
College are still awaiting
news of a possible appeal
by architects Norman and
Dawburn, following the
High Court award of
£850,000 damages five
weeks ago. The fourteen
day 'stay of execution'
granted by judge David
Smout Q C , had now
expired, and hence no
appeal can be made
against the damages
awarded to College. Estates
Secretary Don Clark told
FELIX that an appeal
against the main decision
was still possible, however.
Perry
President
Rob Perry is the new
President of RSMU for the

the Vice-President. The
position of Hon Sec was
contested between Ewan

votes to 35.
