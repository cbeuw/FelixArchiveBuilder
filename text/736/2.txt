Ed i t o r ia
This term everything has
gone wrong with FELIX.
The recent break of my
thumb was typical of the
way FELIX has gone.
Despite all the accidents,
the FELIX staff have been
amazing. They have kept
the paper going. It is
difficult to know how to
thank them. Thanks to
Rosemary Hosking and
Tony Churchill for putting
up with the problems.
Thanks to Dave Jones for
ensuring the news
appeared every week.
Thanks to Chris Edwards
for being general mega-
hero, Special bonus points
for Chris, Judith Hackney,
Sunny Bains and Dave for
staying up all night and
doing all the naff paste-ups
as I couldn't. Thanks to
Mark Cottle, Sunny Bains,
J Martin Taylor, Jane
•Spiegel, Jim Clayden,
Debbie Wilkes, Bill
Goodwin, Nigel Atkinson,
Sarah Kirk, Judith
Hackney, Richard Smith,
Chris Stapleton, Richard
Ellis, Pete Hobbis, Andy
Vickers, K.amal Sen, Rob
Dwyer-Jones, Mike Stone,
Tracy Spalding and anyone
I've forgotten. Thanks to
Sarah, Judith, Nick and
Pete for putting up with me
when I've been pissed off.
Thanks to Swan Lager,
Southside Pizzas, Aretha
Franklin, 10as, Hockey 3rds
and the Face of providing
me with inspiration.

Preece
Defended
Dear Hugh,
It is with strong feeling that
we seek to balance the
opinions you put forward in
your last editorial
concerning the
performance of C & G U this
year, and, in particulary, its
President, Roger Preece,
whilst an editorial is
certainly the place to
present your opinions, your
comments were so vague
and unspecfic that they
merely contributed to a
slur.
The Exec of C & G U has
sought to lessen the 'hack-
orientated' image that has
afflicted Guilds Union in
the past, certainly in the
time we have been at
college. The situation
cannot be completely
remedied in one year, but it
seems to us, as ordinary
members of Guilds, that
things have improved, and
we hope that the progress
[I continues next year, and
subsequently.
Clearly, not every event
or idea has been model of
perfect organisation
(Carnival seems an obvious
candidate for change
though this year's problems
were more the culmination
of a trend, than some one-
off due to lack of
experience). But it seems
quite unjust to claim that
Guilds has been run less
effectively than the other
| C C U s this year. The
perfor
mance of ICU's
sabbatical officers has been
a far more justifiable cause
of concern.
In conclusion, we hope
that you will produce some
more cogent and better
prepared arguements next
year in your role as Guilds
A A O !
Yours sincerely,
Julian Fagandini

According

Dear Hugh,
It is difficult for any person
who acts as a
representative to point to
particular developments for
which he or she is
personally, directly and
individually responsible, as
I am sure Pete Wilson
appreciates. What I seek to
do is to put forward a
student view on the issues
raised at the College
committees I attended.
While I agree that this may
sound to be reacting rather
than initiating discussion it
is not infrequent for
student representatives to
raise issues that they wish
to see discussed.
I do not, therefore,
apologise*for not pointing
to any specific items as my
own achievments. I rely
heavily on the Dep Reps
and A c Reps, who are more
directly concerned with
issues within departments
such as irrelevant courses
and lecturers who can't
lecture. This year I have
attended most staff/student
committees, though I must
stress-the importance of
individual unsatisfied
students indicating their
feelings or their feelings to
their A c Reps, so that
action can be taken.
I 'operate' mostly on
college-level committees
looking at college-wide
issues, and report to my
constituents primarily
through Guildsheet, though
I also present a fairly
extensive report on my
activies to the C & G A c
Reps and Dep Reps under
the auspices of City and
Guilds Union Academic
Affairs Committee. I have
on occasion been tempted
to suspect that the college
sometimes uses
committees, and student
quesitonnaires, etc, to
'keep the students quiet';
but my fears have been
allayed by the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee which has
recently been established
to address the problems
experienced in the college
in undergraduate teaching
generally. I hope to see a
better deal for
undergraduate students in
this college (meaning C & G
perhaps more than IC in
general), as a rather
dissatisfied student myself.
I believe that, at last, there
are signs that progress will
be made.
I trust that if Pete, or
anyone else, wishes to
discuss this further, they
will approach me (or my
successor in office—that's
you Hugh!) directly.
Yours
Luke Walker
Academic Affairs Officer
According
to John
Dear Hugh,
Although I have never
challenged the quorum at a
U G M , today I would have
been prepared to because I
did not feel that those
present represented a fair
cross-section of Imperial
College Students to pass
policy on the issue of
boycotting Barclays. After
the meeting I was
challenged for not having
called 'quorum' at the start
of the meeting by a group
of people who had voted to
pass the motion. These
pe. ale were criticising the
decency of the guy who
called quorum, and others,
who had no wish to disrupt
the running of the union's
affairs.
In return for this decency
the man who made the
challenge was called a
'bastard' and myself a
'fascist'. I am sure that they
would join me in
condemning this mindless,
pathetic cause. Those who
resort to it show the
obvious insecurity of their
own philosophy by virtue of
the fact that they have
nothing more intelligent to
say.
Secondly, I make no
attempt to hide the
moderate views which, I
believe, will be far more
beneficial for the whole of
South Africa. Some would
wish to force a bloody
revolution in South Africa.
If this occurs, we condemn
thousands of people to
violent death. And
afterwards, can we
guarantee a more
representative, less brutal
form of government? Not if
the rest of African
countries which have been
in the same situation are
used in comparison.
The only way forward is
to welcome the far-
reaching, though
insufficient reforms already
intiated by the South Africa
administration. We must
respect the views of Bishop
Tutu and Chief Buthelezi
and shelve the idea of
economic santions. It is our
duty to condemn apartheid,
but preseve the highest
black standard of living in
Africa, and our social,
cultural and economic links
with SA to encourage the
country to take the right
steps towards a better
future.
The mistakes made in
numerous countries across
Africa need not be echoed.
The people of S A have got
a lot to gain and lot to
lose. In the context of SA,
the present administration
is the most 'moderate' for a
long time and appears to
be dedicated to reform. The
propositon of sanctions
which has been rejected by
the United States and
suspended by the
Commonwealth pending
signs of reform is one
which will only hender
implementation of reform
and anger the
administration who are
trying to bring it about. At
th same time its effect upon
South Africa would be
minimal compared with the
effects upon the Southern
Africa countries of
Lesthoso, Swaziland,
Mozambique, Malawi,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Zaire,
Angola, SWA and
Botswana.
Yours sincerely
John Martin
