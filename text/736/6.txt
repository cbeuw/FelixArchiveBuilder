IC Union General Meetings are idiosyncratic events,
often without any relevance to anybody, let alone
students. This column is a less than serious look at what
goes on in this much vaunted, but little attended regular
event.
After the attendance at last
Thursday's UGM, it might be
a little more logical to hold
the next one in the
telephone box outside the
Royal College of Music,
rather than that aircraft-
hanger known as the Great
Hall. The only people there
were those who were
actually standing for
something, just won
something, or just about to
propose a motion. Not only
was there a distinct lack of
audience, but a distinct lack
of the Exec as well.
The Exec is made up of
six people, three sabbaticals
and the three C C U
presidents. Of those, two
actually bothered to turn up,
and one was deputised for
by Dave Colley, who was
only there because he was
about to be ratified as ICU
Honorary Secretary.
IWe were told that Carl
Burgess was ligging "at a
conference" in Belgium.
Dave Kingston was away
canvassing for the ULU
Presidency, seemingly
unaware that he was not
allowed to stand in the first
place. It seems no-one wants
to register him as a student
anymore, and ULU won't
take him if he isn't.
Dave Pearce, RSM
President, carried on his
tradition of never turning up
to UGMs anyway. And
Roger Preece? Well, it was
mainly his fault that nobody
turned up here, as they were
all in Mech Eng 220 at the
time. In his somewhat less
than infinite wisdom, he
decreed that the City and
Guilds Union elections
should take place at
precisely the same time.
Running in fear that
someone should call
"quorum!", Chris Hendy,
chairing the meeting, took
the passing of the last set of
minutes using his inimitable
"section-2.1-bit-about-bars-
is-that-alright-shall-l-take-it-
in-parts-no-you-can't-ask-a-
question" routine.
From there the meeting
went into several bye-law
changes all because Alan
Rose decided that he wanted
to be called Internal Services
Officer rather than Chairman
in a fit of pedantry. No-one
could really argue with him
at the time, since he had
control of the PA at the time.
At this point Christine
Taig, stood up and took the
microphone ready for a
speech on her motion as to
who is allowed to vote in the
Womens' Officer elections.
Despite the original motion
being defeated at the
Hustings UGM, which stated
that only women would be
allowed to vote, it turned out
that no-one wanted to
oppose this after all.
The fun continued with
those all important U G M
Chairman and Academic
Affairs Officer elections.
Prospective Chairman
Gareth Fish fell at the first
hurdle by picking the booby-
trapped microphone, which
gave him the verbal lucidity
of the public address system
at Waterloo Station. Hugh
Southey avoided this by just

shouting at the audience,
and demonstrated his
inability to stand still for
more than two seconds at a
time. However, it seemed to
work, and the FELIX editor
wound-up being elected. He
was so grateful that he ran
off to the Guilds U G M to be
made their Academic Affairs
Officer.
No prizes for guessing that
the next election was for the
IC AAO. We were given the
wonderful choice of Jason
Spyromilio, Charles Brereton
and the everpresent AB
Stain. Jason seemed at great
pains to tell us how much
time he was going to have
next year to spend on our
behalf, and that his favourite
hobby is resigning from
posts he gets elected to.
Meanwhile Charles had
remembered to blow his
nose before the speech and
for a change didn't go
through saying: "well I saw
this geezer (sniff) the ovver
day (snurk) and 'e said wot a
great A A O (snurk) I'd be
(sniff)." Mr Stain again didn't
want to make a speech,
which is probably why he
never wins an election.
However, before we had a
chance to find out who won
this one, the inevitable
happened. "Quorum!" rang
out across the wasted void
of the Great Hall. There were
murmurs of "Oh God, not
again" and louder ones of
"bastard", mainly from the
Anti-Apartheid corner, as
their motion got squashed
for the nth time. And so, as
usual, the meeting ended
on a really friendly note.
