Boat
Saturday last saw a strong
performance by Imperial
crews at Reading Head.
This is the last head for
most crews before the main
event of the season-the
'Eights Head of the River',
and Reading Head is seen
as an indication of how
crews will perform in 'The
Head'.
IC first crew is showing
good racing form and they
won the Senior A Pennant
in a convincing manner.
They came fifth overall,
beatingOxford's first
crews. It is an indication of
the calibre of this crew and
that they were dissatisfied
that this margin was not
smaller.
The head was won
overall by the University of
London eight.
IC's second eight were
unlucky to loose the Senior
B pennant by five seconds.
The club has had a recent
spate of illness and the
latest victim James
'Thunderthighs' Ganderton
went down with 'Spag Bol
Poisoning', and was unable
to row. He was replaced by
Richard 'I've done lots of
training-honest' Evans, but
the crew was unable to find
their previous cohesion and
were disappointed to finish
eighteenth overall.
The novice crew gave a
sterling performance,
finishing a close third in
their division. They too had
a substitute in their crew,
who considering his lack of
experience rowed very well.
They were in contact with
the division winners until
near the end and might
have won the novice
pennant, had they not been
halted by catching two
crabs.
Prospect for T h e Head'
are excellent. The crews
are expected to reach a
peak for the head and will
be on their home water. IC
first crew is hoping for a
top ten position. If the
second eight can find form
they will also have a good
result. The novices have
come on encouragingly,
considering that only two
of the crew has previous
rowing experience. Two
further crews will represent
Imperial. The 'Old Boys',
containing the elite winner
of Burway Fours, with
'squid' Mason ex-olympic
oarsman; and the
'Epsilons', a bunch of
indescribable gorillas,
whose only hope is a freak
tidal wave.
Mr Mason receives his
OAP bus-pass in July.
Not the Boat Club in action.
Football
Guys 1 IC 31
After losing Jim Wilson on
the train and rather
unluckily recovering him
before kick off, IC knocked
high flying Guys out of
their stride. Wright outdid
Brunds 1 min 50 sec knock
out but the referee warned
him for illegal use of the
head. 'Motormouth'
Buckley then conceded a
clear penalty, which keeper
Martin's right hand post
knocked away brilliantly.
However the very same
post then body-swerved
amazingly in order to
deceive the keeper and
gather the ball from an
innocuous high chip to put
Guys ahead. Despite some
entertaining refereeing IC
turned round only 1-0
down.
The second half saw the
referee continue to thrill
the crowd with some
unorthodox stuff, including
a marvellous five minute
recital to skipper Martin
Lake about omnipotence
and his lack of it. This ref
was blind but very
obviously not deaf. IC
pressed forward and were
rewarded with an equalizer
following Jim 'Warder'
Wilson robbing the keeper
and scoring via a
defender's outstanding
shot. The game was
anybody's at this stage and
several times IC had men
over with the final ball
lacking. However, Guys
came back and a brilliant
last minute, one-headed,
spine-tingling hair-raising
death defying, dramatic
and rather quite good save
by Dave Martin secured IC
a valuable point.
IC 3rds 1 RSM 0
RSM came into this game
top of the table requiring
just 2 points in their
remaining 3 games to
ensure promotion. At the
other extreme IC were
bottom and needed to win
2 games from the last 4 to
avoid relegation. All the
smart money was on Mines
(There was even talk that
they would score more
than England had against
the W Indies) but then
football is a funny game!
The first half was fairly
even with Lawrence Covi!
dominating the IC defence
and restricting the
dangerous Mines forward
to one shot on goal. The
most dangerous forward
was taken care of by a well
aimed knee, straight to his
balls, by captian Martin
Lake.
The onslaught on the IC
goal continued in the
second half but the back
four of Hugo Alexander,
Rob Kelly, Laurence and
Jim Wilson held firm with
the occasional mistake
snapped up by keeper Dave
Martin. With twenty
minutes left and the game
still a stalemate, another
brilliant tactical decisions
saw Lake substitue himself
for Eddy Hanett.
Soon after this a break
from IC saw Kev Buckley
run clear and slot the ball
through the Mines defence
to the feet of Mike 'go for
goal' Housby who slotted
the ball beyond the
advancing keeper and into
the net via a defender's
boot.
It was then just up to the
defence to keep up the
great work done so far.
They slipped up once but
the forward who was
through on his own shot
wide.
So much for RSM's
earlier quote from FELIX
(the best team in College)!
IC 6ths 14-CXWM 1
After a long lay off IC VI
returned to action last
Wednesday. Winning 4
useful league points helped
soften the blow of Derby
County's shock FA Cup
defeat later that evening.
Goals from Matt Smith (5),
Al Bamford (3), Si Moulton
(2), Dave Simner (1), and
Eddy Hodnett (3) ensured a
more respectable league
position for the season.
Goal keeper Bran Radukil
was unlucky not to keep a
clean sheet when the only ,
defence mix up of the
game allowed the
opposition a consolation
goal.
Ten Pin
Bowling
Stirchley bowl, Birmingham
was the venue for this
year's sixes tournament,
arguably the most
important event of the
annual fixture list. We
arrived in good spirits to
find out that two of the
team had got lost,
somewhere south of
Watford. However our
decision to stay and
compete was soon
vindicated by excellent
performances from Paul
Steward (242), Nick
Brigham (191), Roger Allen
(195) and Richard Ingram
(190). However this being a
sixes tournament, our four
man team began to slip
narrowly behind the
Birmingham team (the
eventual winner) as the day
progressed. We were left to
reflect on what might have
been: had Mssrs Gamian
Wong and Sean Bailey
attended geography classes
at school they would surely
have known in what region
Birmingham is situated.
