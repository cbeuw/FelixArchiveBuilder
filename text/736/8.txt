r ' C Radio News have
worked marvels this year.
For the first time in years
i they have managed to
produce a local news
bulletin every night. T o do
this they have had to get
involved in finding news.
News Editor Dave Burbage
was extremely worried that
young impressionable first
years might believe
everything the sabbaticals
said so he produced a
'guide to the sabbaticals'
for his team. In this guide
the news hounds are told
to 'speak slowly' to Carl
Burgess who tends,
according to Mr Burbage,
to say that nothing news
worthy happens. If this
happens the news hounds
are told to ask Mr Burgess
what he has been doing.
Dave Kingston is
described as 'rambling'. He
apparently only tells you
something useful after 15
minutes of rambling.
. 't's good to see at IC, a
place with an amazing
reputation for acceptance
and understanding of
homosexuals that gays
receive the respect they
deserve. The sign below
was seen in Min Res Eng
stores accompanied by the
slogan 'aids free zone'.
doctors were puzzled.
There seemed to be two
fractures one of which was
half healed. 'Oh' said Mr
Southey 'that's easy to
explain. 'One of those is
last weeks break'.

,J>f you ever go in the FELIX
office, you will have
noticed Hugh Southey
walking around with his
thumb in plaster. Mr
Southey first cracked his
thumb last week playing
hockey. This injury was
healing well when Mr
Southey fractured and
dislocated it while playing
hockey. When the second
break was X-rayed the
When he returned home he
was in a bad way and so
went straight to bed.
Unfortunately Dave decided
to go sleepwalking at 2am
while still pissed. The
inevitable happened and
Dave ended up flat on his
face in a pool of blood.
Dave then decided to
introduce himself to Ms
Peirce and her room mate.
Let's hope the two of them
have as close a relationship
next year.
Dave gave up drinking at
the start of this year after
after he went to two parties
on successive weekends
and ended up drunk trying
to chat up friend's
girlfriends. May be he
thinks he stands a better
chance of success if he
doesn't drink.
Hugh Southey shows what
a plonker he really is...
1 resident-elect Christine
Taig seems to be one of
these boring people who
never does anything
vaguely funny (more likely
she hides her mistakes
wellâ€”Ed)! Fortunately (for
FELIX) Deputy President-
elect Jackie Peirce seems a
lot more interesting. Ms
Peirce's fondness for a pint
(or ten) is well known. After
a heavy night Ms Peirce is
a changed person. The
normally quiet and refined
Jackie becomes an animal.
In her first year Ms Peirce
went on the piss with R C S .
On returning to Evelyn
Gardens she felt a little hot
and sweaty and so she
decided to have a shower.
Unfortunately she was
having a very interesting
conversation with various
RCS hacks including ex-
RCS Hon Sec Paul
Bloomfield. Fortunately Ms
Peirce managed to
pursuade the RCS hacks to
join her in the shower.
9
\ erhaps it's fortunate for
Ms Peirce that FELIX Editor
elect Dave Jones is an old
friend. Dave is possibly the
only sabbatical IC has ever
had who doesn't drink. This
wasn't always the case,
though, in Dave's first year
he went on a pub crawl.
ave you ever wondered
what goes on in the Polish
Yacht Club-the noisy disco
on Exhibition Road that
keeps half of Princes
Gardens awake every
weekend. The Club always
seems to run the best
parties around College.
FELIX Editor Hugh
Southey, Guilds Hockey
Captain Pete Drummond-
Smith and Mech Eng 1st
year Brendan Farmer
decided to investigate last
Saturday. Carrying a barrel
of Beer stolen from the
Hockey Club dinner they
wandered up to the
enormous bouncers saying
'we heard it was a bring a
bottle party so we brought
a barrel'. The amazed
bouncers admitted our
gallant three. Mr Southey
immediately found a
woman to dance with.
Unfortunately for Mr
Southey his comrades
become worried about the
fate of their beer and
dragged Mr Southey from
the dance floor.

So this is what Quentin does]
on the side
'I didn't expect anything
like this', said someone
next to me during the
interval of Kennedy's
Children. According to the
programme, the play is 'a
diversion from traditional
theatre', and indeed anyone
expecting anything like a
curtain (or dialogue even)
was likely to be
disappointed. Like
Woodstock, A Chorus Line,
The Deerhunter, and a few
other movies rolled into
one, Kennedy's Children is
a play about the Sixties,
written in the Seventies and
revised in the Eighties.
We enter through the
mist into a magnificent
reconstruction of a bar on
New York's Lower East
Side (aptly named,
according to the
customised neon sign,
'Heroes') where images of
Kennedy, Monroe, etc are
projected above the bar.
There sits Wanda, the first
and last character to speak
in the play, and the only
one whose dreams (and
mind) remain intact
through it. Liz Holford
casts a confused (and
beautifully controlled) eye
on the antics of the
characters unfolding
themselves before her. At
first sight, the scars of the
Sixties are most obvious on
Mark, a Vietnam war
veteran spending his life in
a Methadon clinic, and
Rona, a rebel with a cause
and cynical acid-freak later.
Although he hardly moves,
it proves impossible to take
your eyes off the fixed
stare of Mike Foulds as
Mark, while Sam Duerden
manages the difficult task
of remaining entirely
credible while staggering
around angrily discovering
that there are no longer
any openings for a
professional hippy.
Meanwhile, both Tessa
Hoxey as Carla and John
Burgess as Sparger ooze
decaying sex as kids who
started out waiting to be
the new Marilyn Monroe
and end up wanting to be
dead. And it's not just
Lance Holland's hair which
is slick about his
performance as the
Bartender. This was a
superbly understated cast,
backed up to the hilt by a
technical crew who missed
no opportunity to create a
spectacle. Student theatre
is at its best when it
produces collective effort
like this.
