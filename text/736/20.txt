Gliding
After several weeks of
waiting, the required
weather finally arrived for
Imperial College Gliding
Club's Annual Cross-
country Flying Competition
last Thursday. The
objective was to reach
Yoster airfield from our
base at Laseham.
John Towill won both
ballots for choice of glider
and for launching and so
he had climbed to quite a
height in the Capstan
before everyone else was
launched and the race
could begin. This gave him
quite a lead, but Pete
Plackard, the king of
soaring, had fetched up
with the Cadet glider, and
so with his magical ability
to find thermals, Pete gave
John a good chase.
Further back, Andy
Winterton was just
managing to stay ahead of
Tony Shaw, Simon Smith
and Edmund Field. As the
sun climbed higher and the
thermals grew stronger, the
handicap of Edmund's
Nimbus began to show and
he gradually fell back to
join the group hacking
along in the rear,
desperately trying to get
the most out of their old
Libelles, LS4s and ASW19s.
However time and weather
turned against this last
group. James Burdett
found a eported 15 knots of
sink and arrived at 200 feet
with all the fields below too
small to land in.
Fortunately, he spoted a
small airfield in the
distance to land, and the
local flying enthusiasts at
Brize Norton made him
very welcome. The others
of this of this group all had
to land out, apart from
Edmund, who managed to
reach the Malvern Hills,
climb on an updraught and
cruise the rest of the way,
arriving shortly after dark.
This event was enjoyed
by all and was good
practice for this year's
National Universities Finals
which are to be held near
to John O'Groats in
Scotland.
Dancing
The last month has seen
the two big competitions
for university dancers. On
February 14th Valentines
Day, there was the
Southern Universites
competition, held this year
in Walthamstow.
The A-team, consisting
mainly of the old lags did
well individually but Were
not quite able to win the
team trophy. Chris Yates
and Jill Barrett retained
their Waltz title and Neil
McCluskey and Shirley
Brown took the Jive title.
Paul Jeremaes and
Margaret Adams put up a
fine performance to come
second in the Cha Cha Cha
competition and quite
remarkably Jeff Morris ar d
Sara Holmes-Woodhead,
mere beginners at
Christmas, were semi-
finalist in the Quickstep.
This enable us to come
second overall behind the
strong Oxford team.
The B-team made up
entirely of beginners,
namely John Burke and Liz
Quarterman, Dave Willis
and Lisa Sale, Sharad
Somany and Ruth
Steedmand and Dave
Barker and Gill Knowles
did themselves proud,
especially John and Liz
who took the newscomers
Waltz award.
With these results behind
us the A-team, not resting
on their laurels, carried on
with the endless practice
necessary in preparation
for the Intervarsity
competition
This time, having
travelled to the De Montfort
Hall in Leicester, we did it
all again but better. Chris
and Jill again retained their
title and Neil and Shirley
picked up a new one, along
with Paul and Margaret this
time. However, though we
won three out of the four
dances, the controversial
new scoring system only
allowed us to come third as
a team. Many thanks are
due to Jeff and Sara for
dancing the Quickstep even
though Sara had a badly
sprained ankle, without
them we would have come
much much lower.
As well as the team
competitions there was
considerable success in the
more hotly contested open
competitions. Chris and Jill
won the Foxtrot with Paul
and Shirley reaching the
semi-final. In the Paso-
Doble Paul and Margaret
came fifth with Neil and
Shirley reaching the semi-
final. Jeff and Sara
managed the semi-final in
the very acrobatic and
exhausting Rock'n'Roll
competition.
Many thanks are of
course due to all our
trainers and to the club
members for their continual
support and
encouragement over the
year.
NUS
In case you've had your
head buried in a fire bucket
for a few years, a word in
your ear: you're not a
member of the National
union of Students. Nobody
at Imperial is, because IC
Union disaffiliated eight
years ago. As a result,
you're missing out on the
National Union's services to
affiliated Unions-lobbying
and campaigning about our
grants, housing and other
welfare rights; pressure for
the maintenance and
improvement of educational
facilities, better training for
lecturers and so on; legal
advice; financial, welfare
and other research; and
training for our Union
officers-nobody can say
that couldn't be better.
What ever your politics,
or even if you take no
interest in party poltics, it
can't be denied that
education's going through
a pretty thin time—cuts
and, in London particularly,
mergers, have left a
dauntng prospect for any
of your younger sisters nd
brothers thinking of
university about now. Their
standard of living if they do
become students isn't
much more attractive,
considering the fall in the
value of grants (in real
terms, that value has
dropped by 17% since 79)
and the proposal to remove
students from the housing
benefit system.
But, I hear you cry,
surely students have little
power to influence
government decisions
anyway? That may be so,
but the fact is that, when
students are consulted, it's
through the NUS—it's just
plain stupid not to have a
share in what influence
students do have, and now
is the crucial time to do it.
As you may have read in
FELIX, students at K Q C
(the merger of Kings,
Queen Elizabeth and
Chelsea Colleges) and
University College have
come to the same
conclusion. Soon you're
going to be bombarded
with publicity from both
pro- and anti- NUS lobbies
at IC; don't just fall back on
the bigotry that's been
handed down to you, but
listen to the arguments and
decide for yourself.

Cycling
Martin Farrow was still in
bed when seven of us set
off for Box Hill last Sunday.
No sooner had we got out
of Putney than Andrew
complained of a creaking
bottom bracket and went
back home. The rest of us
pedalled merrily onwards
along the A24, and then on
up Box Hill. Admiring the
view of the Downs, we
descended pretty rapidly
and then got split up when
some of us took a wrong
turning. Undaunted, we
arrived back in London at
about 1.30pm.
This Saturday, we again
travel to Essex to ride a 10
mile TT. Two members are
also travelling to Hull on
Sunday to compete in the
National Student 10-mile
championship. Good luck
to all riders.
