In the past couple of
weeks we have seen, on the
FELIX letters pages, female
students angrily
condemming those —
(largely myself, of course,
as Women's Officer) — who
insist on discussing the
small proportion of women
at Imperial College. I
accept that they themselves
may be unconcerned by
the fact; but I firmly believe
that this condemnation is
wrong.
negative responses as well;
May be I should also have
stressed, that I am N O T a
man-hater; and that all the
ideas were not necessarily
my own, some coming from
such radical institutions as
the Imperial College Wives'
Club. I was naive enough
to assume that intelligent
Imperial College students
would not leap to such
damning conclusions.
The response to my letter
confirmed what I already
suspected — that there are
a number of women at
Imperial College who are
desperately unhappy, who
have not met ANY other
women since they arrived
Women's Officer is so
important and should be
taken seriously. Not only
can she deal with specific
health and welfare issues
relating to women BUT she
can also provide a point of
contact for those women
who dp feel isolated; and
hopefully may be able to
help. Nobody would
suggest that because the
majority of overseas
students are quite content
at Imperial, there shouldn't
be a representative they
can turn to if they DO have
specific problems. Nobody
would suggest that the
representative should not
be elected by overseas
students themselves.
Please, don't be so narrow-
minded as to ignore the
fact that isolation — AND
harrassment, I'm afraid —
are REAL problems for
•some women here, even if
you don't mind, or enjoy,
the situation yourself.
Finally, a word or two
about feminism. In the last
few weeks I've got sick of
hearing, "But you're a
feminist!...Not another
feminist!" etc. Well of
course I am a feminist —
and I would venture to
suggest that since feminsim
simply means, by
definition, believing that
nobody should be denied

"The problem

kind of attitude is
this?

Shortly after I
volunteered to do the job of
'Temporary Women's
Officer' I sent out a letter to
all female students, asking
for opinions on various
subjects. This seemed at
the time to be a sensible
way of testing opinion on
the problems, IF ANY, that
women at IC face. A small
but significant number of
women wrote back, and
many more have spoken to
me since, most of whom
saw the post of Women's
Officer as a good thing.
Some agreed with the ideas
put forward, some didn't —
as you might expect.
Disappointingly, N O B O D Y
wrote back to ME to say,
"Shut up about the ratio,
we don't notice it..." — this
side of the discussion was
carried on in a most
indignant fashion on the
pages of FELIX.
To those I offended by
sending the letter, perhaps
I owe an apology. I should
have pointed out, perhaps,
that I would welcome
at college, who feel very
isolated and lonely because
of this. I realise that
undergraduates in large,
well mixed departments
don't realise the plight of
such women, who may be
mainly postgraduates; but I
think comments like, "We
don't mind!... a few I
suppose, must dislike [the
situation]" are incredibly
sweeping and selfish. I for
one, am not prepared to
see those women who A R E
so unhappy written off in
this way — it doesn't matter
if the majority of women
couldn't care less (although
I doubt if this is true) — it
still doesn't mean that we
should ignore those who
do have problems. Surely
that would be narrow-
minded and uncaring... the
same sort of attitude leads
to statements like,
"Nightline should close
because it only gets five
suicide calls a year" —
ignore the minority, the
majority are doing fine.
This is why the post of

rights or opportunities
purely because she is
female, every woman at
Imperial must be a feminist
too, to some extent;
otherwise what would she
be doing studying a
traditionally 'male' subject?
Certainly none of us would
be here if it wasn't for the
life's work of those women
A N D men who held this
basic belief and struggled
to secure educational
opportunities for women in
science and technology.
It is a shame that so
many people abhor the
term 'feminist' because they
think it means a radical,
humourless, militant,
manhating extremist who is
probably a lesbian and can,
of course, be recognised by
her appearance. This,
needless to say, is rubbish
— it is the image of
feminists put about by the
gutter-press' — and as
Imperial College students I
would hope that we would
look further than T H A T for
our education.
