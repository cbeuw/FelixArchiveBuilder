It's A Dog's Life
Dear Sir
May I suggest that the fire
11 on Tuesday night in Pure
[ and Applied Biology could
| have been started by a
beagle having one last puff
I before 'National No
smoking Day'
(Wednesday)?
Yours faithfully,

A Correction
Dear Hugh,
I felt that it might be
important to clear up any
misunderstanding that has
arisen regarding the
relevant dates of
publication/release of
'Kennedy's Children' and
'The Deer Hunter'. Robert
Patrick's play, written in
1974, received wide acclaim
for its departure from
traditional theatre, and can
be seen as having set a
precedent in terms of its
characterisation and style.
'The Deer Hunter'
(Michar Cimino) was made
in 1978.
Yours sincerejy

Children)
Grow Up Seymour!
Dear Mr Southey,
It seems to me that anyone
who is childish enough to
gripe publicly about being
, refused entry to a nightclub
is liable for some-good
natured mickey taking. Mr
Seymour seems to be
ranting and raving about
two letters (not exactly a
vast amount of newsprint!)
being slightly critical of
him. He also appears to
dislike Star Trek—which is,
according to my survey,
quite popular amongst IC
I students. The same survey
j also happened to find the
\ aforementioned letters
quite amusing, which
somewhat contradicts Mr
Seymour's claim to
:
represent the vast majority
of students.
Quite honestly, anyone
I intelligent enough to be
here (and I assume Mr
Seymour is amongst them)
should be mature enough
to take such things in his
stride—and not behave like
| a 'moaning minnie'. As for
the use of pseudonyms,
just what is wrong with
adding a touch of humour
to an otherwise dreary
letters page? So—my final
message to the Seymour's
of this college—GROW UP!

A Christian
Writes...
Dear Hugh,
I have read the
correspondence on the
Unification Church' with
some interest, having been
stopped by them several
times over the years. I
became a Christian at IC
through studying the Bible
and the claims of Jesus
Christ. Over the four years
I have been a Christian I
have become convinced of
the authority and reliablity
of the Bible as the word of
God. During my
conversations with the
members of C A R P it has
become clear that they are
not Christian. When
confronted with this, and
after having their questions
answered from the Bible
they were speechless, and
ended our conversation,
(usually after an hour or
so). The point of this letter
being a warning to those at
IC who are genuinely
interested in looking at
what Jesus said. Avoid the
Moonies. Ask your friends
who you know to be
Christians or a member of
the Christian Union. These
people will probably have
become Christians a similar
way as myself, that is, by
independent study and
conviction by the Holy
Spirit leading to the same
conclusion: Jesus is Lord.
Yours faithfully,

An Apology
Dear John,
I should like to apologise
for the advertisement in
today's FELIX (March 12)
concerning the Jazz Club
Annual General Meeting.
The comment about Duo
was not meant to be taken
seriously—I am quite sure
that, if elected next
Tuesday (March 18), you
would do a very good job
of running Jazz Club next
year. I hope that this
incident will not cause ill-
feeling between us—or
more importantly the bands
we are involved in. Please
accept my sincere
apologies.
I should also like to point
out that the comment about
my fiddling the books was
not meant to cause any
alarm. If any member
wishes to inspect the club's
accounts they are welcome
to do so; I can assure you
every penny has been
accounted for.
Yours sincerely
Charles Brereton
Treasurer, IC Jazz Club

A Trainspotter
Writes...
Dear Hugh,
IC has many active and
interesting clubs, but I feel
that one club is missing. In
my two terms at Imperial I
have met several people
who share my interest in
train spotting. I am sure
that there must be a
sufficient number of
enthusiasts to form a
trainspotters' club.
Such a club would be
able to organize weekend
trips and talks. It would
also provide a forum for
fellow trainspotters to swap
experiences arid compare
numbers.
If anyone is interested in
such a club I would be glad
to hear from you then.
Yours

Melliar-Smith
Exists!
Dear Ed,
I read with interest Ms
Diane Love's letter in FELIX
Fri 7th March in which she
sets out her theory on the
non-existence of a certain
Tom Melliar-Smith (TMS
for short) and possibly
reasons for his creation by
the...'Haven of ageing,
wrinkled and degenerate
hacks'.
Leaving aside the
questions of what the R C S
represents to its members,
and what is in store for us
next year, I would like to
point out some errors in
her imaginative and
interesting theory, and then
show logically that T M S
exists after all.
The theory starts by
assuming TMS does exist,
and thus has two arms and
two forearms, making ten
in all. However, as any
biologist will explain, a
forearm is only half an arm.
In other words, T M S only
has three arms. This is a
significant point, as she has
effectively shown that
3=10. This simple equation
is a new equation,
unknown to every
mathematician since we
first climbed down from the
trees. It is so new in fact,
that many people will
refuse to accept it and
claim that it is false. If so,
then the theory suddenly
starts to look dubious.
The next error occurs
when she explains that as
ten is both even and odd,
then 10=infinity and so
T M S has an infinite number
of arms (derived,
incidentally from yet
another new equation).
The last, and biggest
error is to assume from this
that T M S cannot exist.
However infinitely small
objects may be ignored,
but the problems of
ignoring infinitely large
objects are infinitely worse.
Obviously, with so many
arms, he cannot not exist.
Had she realised this she
could then have made
further deductions
consistent with other facts
about the college.
As a physicist, albeit an
ex-physicist, she must be
familar with Einstein's
famous equation E = M C 2
.
As he has an infinite
number of arms hence
infinite mass, he must
possess infinite energy.
Which neatly explains its
total lack elsewhere the in
College. Indeed, the only
other place energy occurs
is in pubs and bars during
opening hours. This is
easily explained by
assuming that as he has an
infinite number to spare,
T M S gives his energetic
arms to otherwise 'armless'
students, where the energy
becomes the potential
energy created in raising
the drinks from table to
mouth.
Finally to dispel any
lingering doubt, below is
another, more logical proof
of his existence.
1 Both sentences 1 and 2
are false
2 Tom Melliar-Smith exists.
1 Cannot be true, as it
then asserts its own
falsehood so 1 is false. 2 is
either true or false. If it is
false, this means both 1
and 2 are false, so 1 is true.
However 1 cannot be true,
as already shown, so 2
cannot be false. So 2 is
true. So TMS really does
exist after all, as any NMR
spectroscopist could have
explained in the first place!
