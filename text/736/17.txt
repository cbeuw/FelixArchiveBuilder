At last, a comedy that's
actually funny, well I
thought so. Clockwise is a
very suitable vehicle for
John Cleese's talents. He
plays the headmaster of a
comprehensive school who
has the privilege of
becoming the Chairman of
the Headmaster's
Conference at Norwich.
This is an illustrious post,
particularly as it has never
been given to a
comprehensive headmaster
before, but it now gives the
aspiring Brian Stimpson a
chance to address the
headmasters of Winchester,
Eton, Harrow, etc all the
schools 'we all look down
our noses at but would
send our children to if only
we had the money'.
Stimpson is a punctual
man, to the point of timing
his morning assembly
speeches to the second
and castigating his wife in
front of all the school
children criminals, temperal
or otherwise, who have
been sent to 'execution' at
9.20 outside his office. A
small distraction causes
him to miss his train to
Norwich and from then on
his precise world begins to
crumble as he struggles to
get to the conference.
Importantly with comedy
the timing of all the
excellent cast is
marvellous, and the story
contained enough sub-
plots to adequately fill out
the running time. An
example of the intelligence
of Michael Frayn material is
the wonderful contrast
between the sedate monks
and the manic Mr
Stimpson.
It's almost unfair to
single out particular
performances but John
Cleese, of course, and the
old ladies were particularly
good. Recommended.
In complete contrast is
Ran, an astonishing epic
film with few if any
parallels, except possibly
Kurosawa's last film
Kagemusha which won the
Cannes Film Festival in
1980 but which he
described as no more than
a run up to Ran.

The plot is largely based
on King Lear and concerns
the aging hard Hidetora
passing power to his eldest
son. Unfortunately he is
deaf to the pleas of his
youngest son who warns
against the danger of this
action. As a reward for his
honesty and loyalty the
youngest son, Saburo, is
banished along with the
equaly loyal Tango,
Hidetorn then sets out with
the fool to madness.
This journey is set
against a backdrop of civil
war which is beautiful
choreographed and
stunningly photographed.
The battle scenes are some
of the most haunting
images on film, true
cinematic milestones.
(During the film both
Kurosawa's wife and one of
his great friends, the sound
recorder, died, and
sometimes it seems as if
his long and eventful life
with all it's passions has
diffused into the film.)
The acting of Hidetora in
particular has roots in the
Japanese noh theatre and
may prove unconvincingly
historic for an average
western audience but the
brillantly scheming body
Kaede can be understood
by any culture.
The ending departs from
King Lear and it removes
the optimism of
Shakespeare's play and
replaces it with a simple
but powerful allegory. It's
length may possibly require
some effort, but that's a
small price for a
masterpiece.
At the risk of appearing
indiscriminent in my praise
I would also like to
recommend a third film out
this week, Jagged Edge.
This film owes a lot to the
era of Hollywood
psychological thrillers,
though this modern version
shows a good deal more of
the blood and violence.
Jeff Bridges plays a
manipulative, successful
newspaper editor accused
of killing his heiress wife.
Initially under duress, last
partly to redeem hershelf
for an earlier case,
corporate lawyer Teddy
Barnes, Gleen Close,
decides to defend him.
Prosecuting him is the
ambitious District Attorney
who is 'as eager to ride this
case into a senate seat as
he is to prosecute the right
man'.
The plot has enough
twists and turns to provide
a few surprises at the end,
and the acting is
marvellous particularly Jeff
Bridges, who is normally
associated with easy going
characters rather than
manipulative ones. Glenn
Close too is excellent in
her portrayal of all
emotions of her character,
to say which emotions
would give too much away.
Of more dubious value,
unfortunately, is 'Young
Sherlock Holmes and the
Pyramid of Fear', it is 'an
effection speculation on
what might have
happened'. It's heart is in
the right place, with some
nice ideas on how the
dearstalker and pipe etc
may have originated, but
it's mind is a little
displaced, about a century.
But perhaps I'm being a
little unfair, both the young
leads are very'engaging
and Nicholas Rowe,
Sherlock, deserves to do
well, and they are
accompanied by the
excellent Anthony Higgins
and Freddie Jones and
even Nachion Sawalha (as
an Egyptian?!!). It's fairly
enjoyable stuff and if you
do go and see it stay until
the very end, after the
credits).
Briefly I'd like to mention
some interesting
independant films you
might like to see at the ICA
if none of the above
interests you (or even if all
the above interests you).
Ursula and Glenys is a tale
of two sisters brought
together by their father's
unexpected legacy wish.
Intimate Strangers tells the
story of a mother and son
relationship in Brixton. I
found the latter more
credible and enjoyable and
particularly liked the very
natural grandparents.

Any Problems
Vhe main disadvantage
with this kind of benefit is

them of the existence of
your claim. If you

call in to Student Services
and see Lesley, the Welfare
Adviser.
