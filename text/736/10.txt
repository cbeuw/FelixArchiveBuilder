I Conservative Education Policy
Hi
a
The AUT strike at the start of this term was supported by many IC students and staff. FELIX backed
the strike with a special highlighting government education costs. Conservative Society Chairman
John Martin wrote to FELIX complaining about biased coverage. HE now outlines why he thinks the
government is correct....
School Policy
The false prophets of the
60s have gravely damaged
Bristish Education. Instead
of concerning themselves
with standards and skills,
excellence, diversity and
choice, emphasis has been
placed on equality,
uniformity and central
planning. The present
government is pledged to
undo the damage caused
by these misconceptions.
Huge amounts of
taxpayers' and ratepayers'
money continue to be
spent-more than ever
before on each student,
even allowing for inflation,
but the Government has
placed emphasis on
O U T P U T rather than
INPUT, on the efficient use
of resources rather than
fruitless spending, and on
the skill shown by teachers
and acquired by students
rather than on grandiose
social aspirations.
As Conservatives we look
forward to the free play of
market forces in education,
to the benefit of the quality
of the education students
receive; which will involve a
restructing of the
traditional nationalized
education service. The last
Labour administration
imposed comprehensives
upon an often unwilling
population as the only form
of maintained secondary
education. Results in the
combined secondary
modern/grammar school
system outshone those in
the new system, and the
case for the grammar
schools was presented
from all quarters. The
Labour Party remain
dedicated to imposing a
system of pure
comprehensive schools:
they will ban all
independent, grammar and
church schools. David
Owen and Shirley Williams
also require the desecration
of the pillars of our
education system.
The 1980 Education Act
provided for the first time
ever, the parents' right to
express a preference for
the school in which they
wished their children to be
educated. Full information
about the range of schools
available must be given to
parents, and the ability to
choose an independant
school of quality is given
via the enormously
successful Assisted Places
Scheme. In addition,
parents are now to be given
a powerful voice on the
governing body of each
school, with real control
over the running of the
school and spending of
money.
Reform in schools and
the reintroduction of the
values of excellence and
achievement lies in several
directions. In order for
schools to become more
accountable, the
performance of teachers is
under review. Teaching
standards are dependent
upon the quality and
commitment of teachers.
The government aims to
raise the quality of the
teaching profession
through better selection of
candidates for teacher
training, improvement of
initial training courses and
in-service training, and a
career structure which will
improve the professional
standing of the individual
teacher.
Grants or Loans
'No students anywhere in
the world are treated more
generously than British
students. In Sweden and
Japan they would receive
loans, and in many other
countries they would
receive part loans and part
•grants.'
Mrs Thatcher
It has been widely
claimed by Conservative
students, myself included,
that it is time for students
to stop sponging from the
hard-pressed taxpayer,
and take financial
responsibility for the
education from which we
hope to gain. The
proposals made by Sir
Keith Joseph last year
would have gone some way
towards initiating a part
loans, part grants system,
which in time would have
released large amounts of
taxpayers money. This
would have been returned
into the economy, and
would, no doubt, have
released more money for
other areas of education.
Public hysteria, in resonse
to left-wing propaganda

forced a partial break-
down, although the
government has been
forced to bring about cuts
in financial support to
students in other areas.
There is nothing new
about loans, as can be seen
from the statistics above,
and in fact the issue
deserves greater respect
than you may previously
have given it. The vast
majority of tax-payers
footing the bill for our
education have received no
such privilege nor will their
children. Why should they
subsidise our privileged
state? Moverover, Britain is
a substantial loser when
considering the
considerable cost of
educating students who
have no intention of
remaining in Britain after
graduating. Is it wrong to
to suggest that the bill for
education in such
circumstances should
clearly lie at the feet of the
indiviudals, as should the
bill for our own education.
The most effective way of
bringing about these
reforms would have been to
support Sir Keith's
proposals. Instead,
students may be forced
into borrowing money to
subsidise their education
on the private market.
As well as the generosity
of the government in the
grant area at the moment, it
should be remembered that
there is also national
conscription in many of
those countries with which
Britain is compared, a
constraint without which it
would be relatively easy to
repay ones' loan. The
burden would also have
been reduced by a tax-
decuctable repayment
scheme.
The current 'cuts' which
are more accurately small
increases in the level of the
student grants, and
proposals to cut the
benefits previously given to
students are designed to
bring us into line with our
international competitors,
and force students to take
advantage of the rapidly
expanding part-time job
market. Knock them at the
peril of your tax-bill in ten
years time, and support
them in the proud
knowledge that it is your
duty to the tax-payer you
will be after leaving
College.
