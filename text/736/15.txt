Think we need an intro
here.
Despite guest
appearances from the likes
of Peter Gabriel, Nile
Rodgers and Bill Laswelt,
Laurie Anderson's Mister
Heartbreak retains the fresh
quirky American humour
that she has made her own.
The tracks on this album
are collected from her five
hour epic USA Parts 1-4
and later projects. Most
famous for her (so far) only
'chart success' Oh
Superman, Laurie
Anderson is normally
associated with the New
York avant garde scene,
"Singing is a trick
listen to music for
where she is famous for
playing violin with her feet
frozen in a block of ice!
This album, however is
more listenable, being a
blend of ethnic sounds and
rhythms, and modern ideas.
All this, with William
Burroughs appearing on
the last track, can't be bad!
Laurie Anderson is playing
the Hammersmith Odeon
May 24-26.
Brian Eno, despite having
made 20 albums to date, is
one of these people who
everyone has heard of, but
no-one seems to have
heard. More Blank Than
Frank, just released, is a
collection of Eno's songs
from the period 1973-1977.
This compilation, according
to the sleeve notes, marks
the release of More Dark
Than Shark, a book based
on Eno's lyrics and Russell
Mills illustrative
interpretations. Whatever
the reason for its release,
this album chronicles the
period after Eno left Roxy
Music and before becoming
obsessed with ambience.
The tracks are taken from
the albums Here Come The
Warm Jets, Taking Tiger
Mountain, Another Green
World and Before And After
Science, and are all typical
of this Eno. Although best
known for his
collaborations with Talking
Heads, Bowie, Devo and
U2, the solo Eno is well
worth a listen. Look out for
the Eno/Mills exhibition at
the Riverside.
Robert Wyatt's Nothing
Can Stop Us is an odd mix,
ranging from a cover
version of Chic's At Last I
am Free, The Red Flag (a la
Labour Party conference),
a Spanish folk song and
to get people to
longer"
are scenes
the excellent Shipbuilding.
Written by Elvis Costello
and Clive Langer,
Shipbuilding is one of the
few songs written about the
Falklands War, and has
since become a classic
despite the small amount of
airplay it has received.
Robert Wyatt is most
famous for his work with
the Jazz-Rock group Soft
Machine, although an
accident with a liquid lunch
and a third storey window
ended his career as a
drummer. Since then the
wheelchair bound musician
has been actively involved
in South African, and other
left wing, protests. Nothing
Can Stop Us is a must for
every radical student!
Black South Africa is rich
musically as is shown by
the next album, Rhythm of
Resistance, which is the
soundtrack of a film about
contemporary black music
in South Africa. The film
traces the social roots of
black music, and shows it
to be a voice of resistance
to the apartheid system.
Black South Africans
seldom lament or sing the
blues, but show their
superiority to an oppressive
system by their joyfulness,
their warmth and their
delight in living. The tracks
on this album are a
selection from the
professional recording side
of black music, ranging
from Jazz-rock through to
the more traditional, and is
an excellent introduction to
a music, and a culture,
which has so far been kept
of the airwaves.
Pillows And Prayers,
released in 1983, is a
compilation featuring
seventeen of the acts
album, if you can still get
hold of a copy, only costs
99 pence. Cherry Red have
a reputation for signing
good new acts, so watch
this space for future Cherry
Red releases.
Finally despite over 30
albums to his name, Peter
Hammill remains largely
unknown. His career
started with Van Der Graff
Generator back in 1971,
and stretches through to
the present day. Over is a
fine example of one of his
solo albums written just
"Violence on television only affects
children whose parents act like
television personalities."
working with Cherry Red,
an independent label based
in Kensington Gardens.
Quoting from the sleeve
notes 'Within this project
we have tried to emphasise
the popularity and diversity
of those on the label. In
addition to the
contemporary material, a
track by sixties
Psychedelists, The
Misunderstood is included
as an introduction to our
archive material'. Wowee!
Also included are tracks by
Tracey Thorn, Everything
But The Girl, Atilla The
Stockbroker and The
Monochrome Set. The

after, and about, his long
time girlfriend leaving. It is
allowably self indulgent in
its analysis of love, hate,
lust and yoga. Musically
both emotional and
powerful, it is very much in
the seventies mould.
However Hammllls lyrics
are his forte, which alone
make the album
worthwhile. Listen out for
the bits which Marlllion
ripped off (Over is one of
the albums on the cover of
Marillion's Fugazi). I
recommend buying any of
the Hammill/Van Der Graff
records.
'Keep Music Live' runs the
slogan of the musicians
union and so it should be
in a place like London.
More to the point one of
the things I was always led
to expect about university
was college bands. So what
is the state of home grown
music at IC? Prompted by
meeting people around
college who seemed
disillusioned with
conventional music (eg
radio, TV, commercial
records) I set out to get
better informed.
It is fairly well known that
Brian May of Queen is an
ex-science student at IC,
but to claim much
connection between Queen
and IC is dubious to say
the least (although R C S
may try, they also claimed
their Hon Sec was a
student!) Despite such a
heritage the college band
'scene' at IC seemed until
recently very much non-
existant. For a college of
over 5000 students IC has
very poor facilities for
bands to rehearse and
record. Basically the
facilities that are available
revolve around the
misleadingly named Jazz
Club.
Charles Brereton and the
rest of the Jazz club
committtee were somewhat
elusive but I got a better
response from John
Lambert of the band
Schrodinger's Cat, of whom
more later. The club has a
room on the second floor
of the union building rather
ignominiously above the
ladies loo. In addition to a
very basic PA the room
also has a programmable
drum machine and there is
some storeage space
although it is fairly
cramped. John pointed out
that the room is rather
poor acoustically and really
needs proper carpeting and
some, wall drapes to
deaden reflections. In
addition there are no multi-
track recording facities at
all.
Given this situation and
the oft quoted lack of arts
students it is still wrong to
write IC off musically. One
band who seem to have
attained cult status without
any regard for the
ridiculousness of their
situation are the notorious
'Norman and the
Nutburgers'. Having heard
much about the guitar
gigs. At that point their set
consisted of 3 songs which
posed a minor problems
when they had to do two
encores. This led to a
massive song writing spree
in preparation for the
Physics/Life Sci party. The
band are in fact based
around people from
Physics 2 and are currently;
John Lambert—Vocals,
Guitar and Harmonica;
Nick Coates—Guitar;
Isabel O'Brien—Violin,
Piano and Vocals;
Sara Shepherd—Bass and
prowess of Andy 'Link
Wray' Meeson and the
unique vocal qualities of
Charlie Troupe. I finally
caught up with them at one
of their many 'last ever
gigs'. And jolly good fun
they were too, epitomising
everything a garage band
should be. It appears that
they don't want to take
things too seriously, but
whether they have really
played their L A S T ever gig
I'm still not sure.
Schrodingers Cat are a
band who seem a bit more
certain about what they are
doing. They describe
themselves as folk rock and
will be known to anyone
who went to the Smoking
Concert or S C A B night
which were their first two

I first encountered
Schrodingers Cat at their
first outside gig on the 30th
January this year which
was also their first with a
drummer.This was at the
Pearly King Bromley-by-
Bow as support to
Acoustic/Electric prog rock
duo Twice Bitten.
Originally they got the slot
on a break even basis but
as they packed the venue
they made a small amount
of money and should, by
the time you read this, have
played the same venue
again this Sunday.
Currently the band have
been concentrating on
incorporating Jim, the
dummer into the line-up
and are now working on
building their own PA.
They are helped in their
pound problems by the fact
that John worked as a
sound engineer before he
came to IC. He explained
to me how they hoped to
avoid the problems that
some bands experience in
'Miking up' individual
practice amps into hired PA
systems by building their
own system. I also got
some of the shortcomings
of the Jazz room system
pointed out to me as I
watched them rehearse one
Friday afternoon earlier this
term. They now have a set
of about an hour of original
material in addition to
which they do a good cover
of a song called 'Only
Ninteen' by the Australian
band Red Gum and also
'Johnny B Goode'.
Following the Physics Life
Sci party the original line
up recorded a tape, using
an old Revox 2-track
maching, which is available
mrom John Lambert via
Physics 2 letter racks at
£2.50. This should help to
fund further projects, the
next of which is to make a
proper demo tape for
record companies and the
like. To this end the band
are hiring 16-track
recording equipment and
borrowing IC radio's
Southside studio for a week
over Easter.
Hopefully this article will
be the beginning of a series
highlighting just what can
be done in the musical line
at IC with a little
perserverance. Last
Saturday at the invitation of
Ian Morris the keyboard
player I went to see Duo
and next term I hope to do
another feature including
them. I will finish by noting
that at the begining of the
year the estimated budget
for Jazz Club was £60 while
at the last count they had
over 70 members. Perhaps
jwriting about what people
jare already doing will
iencourage others to have a
go and will at the same
time mean better facilities
develop. Even if you're not
very musical, like me, Jazz
club is still looking for
some people with a bit of
organisational gumption
and enthusiam to run it
