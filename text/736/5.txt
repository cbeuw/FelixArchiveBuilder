Dainty
Protest
Physics lecturer Professor
J C Dainty walked out of a
first year lecture last
Wednesday after a paper
missile was thrown by a
student.
Prof Dainty was due to
give a lecture in Quantum
Mechanics. The class was
particularly noisy from the
outset and he at once
requested the students to
quieten down. After five
minutes a paper dart was
thrown as Prof Dainty was
writing on the blackboard.
As he turned round a
heavier paper missile was
thrown from the back of
the lecture theatre. He
asked whoever was
responsible to leave
immediately, and repeated
the request when nobody
came forward, threatening
in addition to stop the
lecture. When none of the
students left, Prof Dainty
walked out, saying that the
lecture would not be
repeated and that the
relevant material was still
examinable.
Prof Dainty was later
visite*d by the Academic
Reps, who apologised on
behalf of the class. He
returned to hold a
classwork at 11.30 and
agreed that he would re-
teach the material in the
next lecture period. He
apologised for walking out
and said that he
appreciated the Academic
Reps coming to see him.
Prof Dainty told FELIX
earlier this week that the
incident was very
unfortunate, but that he felt
he had to make a
statement. He regretted
that the student responsible
had still not come forward,
but stressed that 'the door
is still open for he or she to
apologise'.
Chaplaincy
Collect
£112 was raised for Oxfam
by members of the West
London Chaplaincy and the
West London Catholic
Chaplaincy on Saturday. 30
people took part in the one
hour 'sponsored busk' in
Covent Garden. The event
included singing, clowning,
juggling and performances
from a Baroque group.
Kingston Cannoned
ICU Deputy President Dave
Kingston has failed in his
bid to win the post of U L U
President for next year.
Saturday's election was
won by Jane Cannon of
UCL, who polled 40 votes
out of 92 on the first
allocation, lain Walsh was
second with 27 and Dave
Kingston third with 24.
Adam Wyatt polled only
one vote and came fourth.
Mr Kingston was eliminated
after the first re-allocation.
The final voting figures
were, Jane Cannon 56, lain
Walsh 34.
It had seemed doubtful
last week that Mr Kingston
would be able to stand in
the election. As a
sabbatical at IC he is not
registered on any course
and so is not a registered
student of London
University. This made him
ineligible as a U L U
candidate. Mr Kingston was
allowed to register on a
course in the Aeronautics
Department last Friday
after a meeting with IC
Rector Professor Eric Ash.
Mr Kingston told FELIX
that he was disappointed
with the result, but that he
was not taking it
particularly badly. He
added that he thought Jane
Cannon would do an 'okay
job' as President.
Winos Win
Imperial College have
reached the final of the
Peter Dominic Inter-
University Wine Tasting
Competition by winning the
South East England round
of the competition.
The team, which
consisted of Mark Masento,
Tony Broadbent, John
Craven, Keith Russel and
Julian Wilson, had to
identify the country of
origin, the subregion, grape
variety, year of vintage and
producer's name of several
wines. They beat teams
from Oxford, Cambridge,
East Anglia, UCL, Sussex
and Loughborough, scoring
301 points out of a possible
600.
Procedure
Accepted
A new disciplinary
procedure was approved at
Imperial College Governing
Body last Friday. Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur
and ICU Deputy President
Dave Kingston discussed
details of the new
procedure before it was
submitted. Mr Kingston
said that the changes
suggested by the Union
had been included, and
that he was satisfied with
the final form of the new
policy. In particular, the
clause which had allowed a
student's penalty to be
increased if he or she
appealed against a decision
had been omitted.

Alternative z
Prospectus %
Unlikely
There will not be an
Alternative Prospectus
produced this year because
of IC Union's unwillingness
to go against a decision
taken by last year's Union
Finance Committee. It was
decided last year to make
the A P a bi-annual
publication and £400 was
added to it's £2700 budget
in order to produce extra
copies for this year.
Although the Union
Sabbaticals acknowledged
that last year's decision
was a bad one, they were
unwilling to give this year's
AP editor-elect, Sunny
Bains, money to produce a
new one as they felt the
Union would look silly
because it had already
spent the extra £400. They
also failed to formally
support attempts to get
money from College as
they felt they would lose
face by doing so.
