Opinion
approval is a very big N O . Is it
possible that this is what they expect
and so this move is a backdoor to
the end of the IC Rag Mag? Why not
just come out and say that its useful
life is over, and that we dare not
publish another because it may
cause Rag, the Union and the
College a whole host of problems?
Be honest with us above all else!
I have now drifted away from the
Rag Mag question and am really
addressing the whole area of the
running of Rag in general. Over the
last year, and it certainly seems to
be continuing, Rag has been run by
and, to an extent for, a very small
and select group of people. The
term 'Raggie' has even been used to
describe these Rag Hacks, and yes,
last year I certainly was one. This
really limits the involvement of
people in IC Rag, and is typified by
the vast totals some of us raised last
year, and by the faces which became
all too familiar at the many Rag
Bureaucracy and
centralisation is killing
IC Rag
events. The Rag Raids last year were
not even advertised to encourage
new people to turn up. This is all
part of the bureaucracy and
centralisation that is gradually
killing IC Rag. Rag events now have
to be cleared by one of four people
(but for a last minute decision this
would have been only one person!).
How easily is a stranger to ICRAG
going to get such clearance?
Imagination is being stifled, since a
small group can come up with only
a limited number of ideas, and
This year's Rag Mag—a close shave
enthusiasm will decline as people
get bored or frustrated. This is being
done in the best of intentions of
course, trying to preserve our now
regained street licence, but there is
a difference between being
reasonably cautious, and being
totally neurotic. This line was
crossed about six months ago.
All I have done so far, you may
say, is sling rocks, and not suggest
solutions. Clearly we must address
the question of the Rag Mag's
future, since at the moment we are
merely wasting the editor's time and
effort with the continual uncertainty
of the censorship position. Limiting
sale to students and the removal of
censorship is my favoured solution,
but the end of the Rag Mag is
another possibility. The problem of
the attitude taken by this year's Rag
Nigel Baker tiddles whilst Rag burns
Chairman, and some of the
committee, about Rag in general is
more difficult. A n injection of
calcium to the spine might be an
idea, but it does not address the
central problem of the lack of
realism that predominates. I can
only hope that there is a reappraisal
of some of the more ludicrous
suggestions about controlling the
maniac students hell-bent on losing
us our license and privileges, and
that the spontaneity and fun that
has typified ICRAG in the past
returns. It's time to be realistic about
how Rag works, and how charities
view us, and not to think that
everyone is begging to have us help
them raise money.
Recently I threatened to resign
from the Rag committee as a protest
about the current state of affairs. I
now believe such an action is not in
the best interests of Rag, but will
instead stay on the committee and
fight for what Rag is really all about.
I hope I can count on the support
of many IC students in this, and
would suggest that you make your
views felt by turning up to the next
Rag meeting, which I believe is
today, Friday October 14, in the
Lounge at 12.30pm.
Rag is fun, go out
and enjoy yourself
and help others at the
same time
One last thing I should say, lest
the above should put people off
getting involved with Rag. Much of
Rag is fun, and will continue to be
so, so go out and enjoy yourself on
a Rag event and help other people
at the same time. That is really what
Rag is about.
