THE FEATURE THE UNION TRIED TO BAN
The Union Snack Bar
Two of the food outlets around College have recently been refurbished.
The Union Snack Bar, situated in the Union Building, Beit Quad, serves
two hot dishes a day, salads and a variety of vegetarian foods all freshly
prepared. While the Main Dining Hall in the Sherfield building has added
a new pasta bar to its established traditional dishes.
Are the discerning tastes of IC's students satisfied ? Felixihvestigates
After last year's problems the
Union Snack Bar is trading once
again. The debts from last year have
been written off and a further
£ 4 0 , 0 0 0 has been spent on
improvements in what Union
Deputy President Chas Brereton
describes as the 'most major
refurbishment of facilities in recent
times.'
The bar has been redecorated; the
lounge seats replaced with modern
chairs and matching circular tables.
Also new are two vending machines
and a pool table. There are new staff
and a new Snack Bar Manager, Mr
Ian Richards. A catering consultant
was responsible for the whole
spectrum of the operation from the
image, to recruiting staff,
structuring and pricing of the menu,
right down to recommending the
size of portions.
The Union refur-
bishment cost
£40,000
The accounting books give an
unequivocal affirmative; the first
week's takings were up 22% on a
similar period last year. But
numbers are, at best, only half the
story. What does that expert of
culinary criticism, Mr Joe Student
think ?
Layout
Dave Peacock, who as Union
Manager has overseen the work on
the snack bar talks of the 'total meal
experience' and of meals that go
beyond the 'diameter of the plate.'
To this end the whole refurbishment
was aimed to promote the Snack Bar
as a social area as well as a place to
eat.
Talking to the customers on
Tuesday the layout and the
atmosphere were generally
appreciated. There were a few
mavericics. ivianuy, a rnysics
student felt it was 'too clean and
canteeny' whilst her friend
Farznana thought it to be 'improved
but not as cosy.' Tony, a Physics
Postgraduate commented 'the pool
table's a bit daft—they could have
had more tables.'
Food
A new step this year has been the
introduction of slightly
unconventional vegetarian dishes.
Ian Richards, the Snack Bar
Manager concedes that quite a lot of
the dishes are 'heavily Vegan' and
that there had been complaints
about the sweet and sour lentils and
pasta with peanut butter sauce
because 'people are not used to it.'
Chen a Biochemistry student was
impressed.'Very good food, I like
the idea of the vegetarian stuff-
very healthy'
Oren from the Royal College of
Music commented 'some of it's
quite good, some not very
imaginative, some a bit like school
dinners.'
It was generally felt that the
variety and balance of the menu was
good, except perhaps on the salads,
whilst some still felt there was a
need for vegeburgers.
Rupert from Chemical
Engineering was not so happy;
whilst he appreciated the money
spent on the refurbishment he was
not at all impressed with his
vegetable moussaka which he
described as 'thinly sliced,
unpeeled, virtually uncooked
potato, aubergine, beautifully
covered with this film of curdled
milk.'
Another satisfied customer?
Value for
money Overall
But Lewis (Aero) was unappeased
(what?): 'Overpriced, sh*t food—a
nightmare to find a seat!'
Both the size and cost of portions
were recommended by the catering
consultant who ran the London
School of Economics Union cafe.
Chas and Dave put this down to a
'fine-tuning process' and some
prices were changed on Tuesday,
though some were still 'a little
anomalous'. Among these
anomalies were the baked potatoes
with cheese which were initially
priced at £1.00 only to be reduced
later to the Southside price of 70p.
Indeed, on Tuesday the students'
lot was a happier one.
Ivan (Life Sci) felt that the prices
were 'fairly reasonable and,
compared with the JCR, quite
good'.
So when everything's said and
done, will people continue to eat in
the Snack Bar, or will they take their
custom elsewhere?
Chen (Chem/Biochem): 'I like the
food here better than the other
outlets'
Dave and Tony (Physics PGs):
'Better than anything else'
'prefer the food in here—more
variation and better value than QT'
Others use the Snack Bar because
it's close to their department, and
another gave the hereto
unconsidered, though slightly
political view, that the Snack Bar
was 'miles from Mech Eng, so you
don't get any fascists in'.
Ian
Richards
Ian has had ten years' experience
in catering: working for large
companies, such as Nissan, and also
for contract companies.
Although he has inherited the
menu and costing, he hopes to
change things to win back the
custom lost due to the pricing. To
this end he is keen to have feedback
and any comments—'We're man
enough to take it'
