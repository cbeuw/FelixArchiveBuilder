The President
Talks
Professor Eric Laithwaite, wild card
of the science and engineering
world will give his Wellsoc
presidential talk on Monday,
October 17th at 7pm in Physics
Lecture Theatre 1. Professor
Laithwaite invented the linear motor
and has discovered many unusual
properties associated with
gyroscopes (you may have seen his
demonstration on television of a
young child lifting a 50 pound
weight with one finger).
Controversy has raged over many
of his ideas and many have tried to
discredit him. He does, however,
have a habit of being right in the
end.
Professor Laithwaite is also
interested in patterns in nature, for
example why mud cracks the way
it does (more interesting than you
might think) and how many of
man's inventions have already been
invented by nature—the insect with
a liquid crystal display and the fish
with a radar.
If you just want to come to this
talk it will cost 50p but it's worth
taking out membership (£1.50) and
getting into all future Wellsoc talks
free. To find out about other talks
and events see us on Monday or
drop a note in Spenser Lane's
pigeonhole, Met Sci 2.

Grand Prix to
Scalextric
Guilds Motor Club put on an
impressive display at Freshers' Fair,
designed to show the participation
of Club and College in all levels of
motorsport.
Despite the name, students from
any C C U are welcome to take part
in our night navigational rallies,
autotests, production car trials,
treasure hunts, circuit trips, kart
trops and scalextric evenings.
Star of the display was a Williams-
Honday FW11. Although carrying
number 6 and the name Nelson
Piquet this was in fact the spare car
used by Britain's Nigel Mansell to
win the 1986 British Grand Prix at
Brands Hatch. The car in full
Marlboro livery was a March 88B
F3000 car. This was kindly loaned by
Onyx Race Engineering, who are
developing a Formula One car in the

SKI CLUB
We're Going
Skiing
The IC Ski Club is a large active club
which aims to encourage students
to learn to ski as well as enabling
more experienced skiers to ski at
reduced prices. This year we have
organised a holiday in the French
resort of Val Thorens, which is the
highest resort in Europe and is
linked to Miribel, Courcheval and
Les Menuires. The cost will be about
£280 but this includes travel (out by
coach, flying back), self-catering
accommodation, lift pass for the
whole area, ski and boot hire, ski
lessons and insurance (ie everything
except food and drink). There are
reductions if you do not require
equipment or lessons, and there is
a possibility of travelling out by air
for a small extra charge.
The Club also organises dry slope
lessons on Wednesday afternoons
(strongly recommended for
beginners) and dry slope races on
some Sundays (first race is on
October 23.

Club's activities, please come to one

Prisoners of
Conscience
Welcome (back) to IC and to IC
Amnesty—a small but very active
group. What, you may ask, is
Amnesty International? It is a
worlwide organisation which seeks
the release of prisoners of
conscience, ie people detained
anywhere for their beliefs, colour,
sex, ethnic origin, language or
religion, who have not used or
advocated violence. It works for fair
and prompt trials for all political
prisoners and on behalf of such
people detained without charge or
trial. Amnesty also opposes the
death penalty and torture or other
cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment of all
prisoners without reservation. It has
no political bias.
Our Club has a new adopted
prisoner—Alaattin Sahin, a chemical
engineer from Turkey. (More about
him in future.) We have been very
successful in the past year. Ivan
Starovoit, fo the USSR, was released
early this year and our next
prisoner, Samsu Gain from
Bangladesh, has also been released.
In addition to working for our
prisoner, we do Urgent Actions
(sending immediate letters/tele-
grams to help people in imminent
danger of being tortured, executed
or who have 'disappeared'), take
part in various campaigns, run a
letter-writing stall in College and
raise funds.
Do join us! We meet every
Tuesday, 5.30pm, Brown
Committee Room in the Union
Building. Please contact Radha
" Chakraborty (Maths 2) or Monique
Yeo (Maths 3) for further details.
