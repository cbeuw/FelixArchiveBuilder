Booze
By Neil Motteram
Firkin Pubs are amongst the most
popular of student meeting places.
The chain of eleven public houses
was based around the ideals of good
beer, plain furnishings and a
friendly atmosphere. Now the
youngest of the chain, the Hamingo
and Firkin, is no more!
It was 'de-Firkinized' on the 22nd
of July with the Flamingo
ceremoniously carried out in a black
coffin.
The Kingston-on-Thames pub,
previously the Three Turts, a
boarded up Watneys' wreck, was
opened last September but when
Bruce's was sold to Midsummer
Lesiure over the Summer, Grand
Metropolitan, the owners, refused
to transfer the lease. The pub has
now become 'The Flamingo
Brewery Company' managed by
Clifton Inns, a Grand Met
subsidiary. There is rumour that
Midsummer intend to open a new
Flamingo and Firkin in Derby later
this year.
Whilst David and Louise Bruce
have disappeared off into the Med
for a cruise and a well earned rest,
the other two ex-directors of the
Firkin chain have gone straight back
into the business. Paul Andrews
and Rory Garden have opened the
'Pig and Parrot' next to Kew
Gardens station (District Line and
BR). The pub lacks Bruce's
notorious home brews but well kept
6X, King and Barnes' Master Brew,
Kingsdown and Adnams Best in a
pleasant Firkin-style main bar with
a stylish conservatory make a
welcome change from many dingy
West London pubs. More 'Pig &
Parrots' are on the way.
Finally, some sad news.
Whitbread are closing the Thomas
Wethered's Marlow Brewery, taking
with it several hundred years of
brewing tradition. Whitbread are
possibly the worst big brewer for
buying and closing small breweries.
Wethered's name will live on for
some time as a 1036 brew produced
elsewhere but production of the
stronger beers is to be curtailed.
