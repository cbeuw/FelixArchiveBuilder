Union
The big boss
The latest figures available for the
Sportshop show that in the year
ended 31 July 1987 a profit of £850
was made. When the assets of the
shop were considered for the
accounts the stock was valued at
£20,958. It is now proposed to
revalue the stock at its true worth.
Estimates from the Union Manager
David Peacock and the Union
Finance Officer Reggie
Blennerhasset, seem to indicate that
a figure of £8000 is about the
maximum the stock is worth. If this
figure of £8000 is used in the
accounts then the Sportshop will
have actually made a loss. There are
many reasons for this situation.
When the present management took
over they inherited a lot of obsolete
stock; people have been unable to
buy even the basic items of
sportswear and sports equipment.
Another problem was the location;
any trading outlet purporting to sell
sports goods needs to be near the
sports facilities.
Over the past year a decision was
made to negotiate with STA with a
view to them moving into the
sportshop unit in addition to their
present unit. The contracts were
signed on October 5. For the session
1987/88 STA paid the Union £2,500
rend and £6,790 in dividend; the
divident is a percentage of sales.
With the renegotiated deal STA will
pay £12,000 a year rent and a sliding
scale divident which should bring in
about £15,000 in the next year.

Hon See's bit
Freshers' Week seems to have been
a great success and I hope that you
won't all suddenly become social
recluses with only a problem sheet
for a friend.
Next Wednesday, the 19th, there
is a free disco in the Union Lounge
starting at 9pm with a happy hour
from 7-8pm where bitter and lager
will be 60p a pint.
On Thursday 20th, Diesel Park
West who are an excellent guitar
band are playing in the Lounge with
a disco and bar extension until
midnight.
On Saturday 22nd, there will
hopefully be a Country and Western
night in the Union bar assuming I
can find a suitably cheap and tacky
duo. This isn't meant to be taken
strictly seriously so don't turn up
your nose in disgust; go along and
have a laugh.
If anyone has any ideas for events
in College, please come and have a
word with me because I can't hope
to please everybody without
suggestions from you.
Groovy maul
Ah yes! After the thrills of^Freshers'
Week and the excitement- of
yesterday's Brilliant Corners gig,
what else can IC Ents come up with
' for the rest of the year.
To start, there's Diesel Park West
playing in the Union Lounge on
Thursday October 20. The band play
a peculiar hybrid of mainstream pop
and rock tinged with sixties
melodies. Tipped for big things
shown by the record company
interest they attracted recently, and
the buzz they created when they
toured with That Petrol Emotion.
Not only this, there's also a disco
(with the recently refitted Lounge
looking/sounding better than ever)
and a bar extension till 12pm.
Tickets a mere £1.50 in advance, £ 2
on the door and £ 1 with Ents card
available from the Union Office, and
from the Union Snackbar.
Also Ents cards will be available
on the door. These entitle you to
discounts on admission prices for all
the events IC Ents put on
throughout the whole year. You
need a picture of your own sweet
self and just £ 7 .
Doors on Thursday night open at
9pm and it promises to be a good
one.
Paul Watkiss,
Ents Chairman.

Internal
Workings
The Internal Services Committee j
this year has been structured to deal
with any complaints on the internal
services available. How does it
work? Sitting on the Committee are
a number of people responsible for
taking decisions on the services
provided by the Union which
include:
Bar (Union)
Bookshop
Games machines
Haldane Library
Print Unit
Snack Bar
Sport shop
STA Travel
Transport
Union Building
College services are more difficult to
deal with but the management
committees are always open to
suggestions to improve their
services. You, the. students are
represented on these committees by
the sabbaticals, myself and the
Union Manager.
All the representation is available,
it is just up to you to tell those
representatives what you would
like. This is where my job comes in.
I will be responsible for receiving
your complaints (or comments),
collating all the complaints and.
directing your views to the
appropriate management
committee. Without your
involvement this committee will
serve no useful purpose and the
various committees will continue to
do as they feel fit which might well!
be at variance with what you want.
It is very important for us to have
some feedback, positive or negative.;
If you, or a group of you, wish to
comment you can write to me by
addressing the letter:
Neil McCluskey,
Internal Services Officer
Imperial College Union
You can post the letter through the
internal mail system by giving it to |
your departmental messenger or
security guard. Some letters on
small issues I will be replying to
personally so please enclose yourj
name and department. Letters:
about wider issues, upon which V
hope there will be lots of comment,
will be replied to in FELIX.
