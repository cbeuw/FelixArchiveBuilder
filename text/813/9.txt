NICE FOOD SHAME ABOUT THE COMFY CHAIRS
The Main Dining Hall
The calm before the storm?
The aim of the Main Dining Hall
refurbishment was to bring 'the
school dining room image up to
more of a restaurant-style standard,'
according to Mr Rob Northey, the
Refectory Manager. In improving
the appearance and set up of the
hall it is hoped to attract trade from
conferences.
Mr Northey was not
able to comment on
the cost of the work
but in actual fact it
cost £300,000
'If we can get outside bookings we
can keep prices down for the
students,' Mr Northey said, adding
that the refectories would not break
even without such functions.
So what has changed ?
In addition to the conventional
food available at the main counter,
a salad and pasta bar has been
introduced, serving five types of
pasta. Further to this, new tables
and chairs have been put in, along
with new cashier desks aimed at
reducing queues. Unfortunately Mr
Northey was not able to comment
on the cost of the work which has
been completed over three years
with the help of consultants and
outside contractors.
But aside from all the financial
politics, what do the punters think ?
The raw statistics are promising,
with takings up 20% or so. A figure
that Mr Northey feels could be
comfortably improved upon, if the
hall's capacity could be increased :
an option that was indeed
considered, but since any costs
would have -to be met by the
refectories through increased prices
this idea was dropped.
Layout
An effort has been made to break
up the tables, while maintaining the
number of seats at last year's level.
Later this term screens will be
introduced with the same aim.
Matthew (Chem) thought the lay-
out was "much improved ; seats
much nicer aesthetically."
Sanjay (Comp):
"I think the chairs are better, and
the lighting."
Gaby (Elec Eng):
"I like it, I think the atmosphere is
quite nice in here."
Dave and John (Elec Eng):
"Gets quite crowded and the
queues are a bit long."
Rob
Northey
Rob has been Refectory Manager
for three years, during which time
the QT bar has been set up in the
JCR and a kebab bar opened in
Southside.
In answer to criticisms that
portion size was dependent on the
time of serving and the server, he
replied, "Absolute cr*p!" This is
believed to be a specialised catering
term. He added,
"If anyone feels that a portion is not
the right size they should see the
Manageress."
Further, the MDH staff are prepared
to change food for whatever reason,
by and large without question.
"I would rather have people return
food than have a complaint raised
6 weeks later at committee."
Gaby.'l like it, I think the
atmosphere is quite nice.'
Food
Most felt that the pasta bar was a
useful addition and that -otherwise
the meals were very much as they
were. Those new to the Refectory
were on the whole impressed with
The seats are too
comfy (Rob
Northey)
the variety of dishes available. More
seasoned customers, such as Ian
(Elec Eng) considered the variety to
be "just the same apart from the
pasta."
Value for
money
Richard: 'pretty expensive.'
The prices have gone up with
inflation, which for IC amounts to
about a 7
% increase in cost. But
students are particularly sensitive
creatures when it comes to money.
Richard (Aero) found it "pretty
expensive" but admitted he was
used to subsidised prices. Louisa
(Chem Eng) thought the prices were
reasonable, while Dave (Physics)
was prepared to say that "this is the
best value around College."
.There was some concern over the
price of canned drinks, as two
students paid 40p for a can : their
Refectory price is 30p.
Overall
So has anyone been put off the
MDH ?
Dave and John again:
"Tried QT once - damn sight better
down here than upstairs."
Vaskar (Elec Eng):
"Would spend just as much money
in QT, but get better value in here."
Sanjay and Ian again:
'Worth coming down here —
looked like a primary school hall
before.'
'Decor like a proper restaurant.'
'A bit more professional.'
