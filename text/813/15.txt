Engineering: No Thanks
In the middle of September the
Department of Education ordered
an inquiry into why the numbers of
university and polytechnic students
pursuing degrees in engineering are
insufficient to meet the needs of
industry. The new investigation is
to centre on two surveys to be
carried out over the next six months
into, firstly, why many sixth formers
studying maths and physics 'A'
levels do not pursue engineering
degrees and, secondly, why so
many engineering undergraduates
abandon their courses, and what
their future career choices are.
Another problem of equally serious
magnitude, but outside this inquiry,
is the number of engineering
graduates who proceed to careers
in, for example, banking and
accountancy.
Fewer Students
Universities are beginning to feel the
effects of a reducing university-age
population in falling applications,
but the fall in engineering
applications is far more rapid:
general engineering course
applications fell by 28% compared
with 1987, civil and electronic
engineering applications by 10%.
The problem causes considerable
anxiety to Imperial College at a time
when it is required by Government
to increase student numbers.
The main deterrents to sixth-
formers applying to engineering
courses are the questions of status
and salary. Engineering has a very
low status in Britain compared to
our major competitors such as West
Germany, and this is not helped by
every other manual worker in the
country calling themselves
'engineer'. Mechanical engineers
mend your car and drive trains,
electrical engineers mend your
washing machine, civil engineers
built the M25 and nobody knows
what a chemical engineer does, or
at best thinks he is a creator of
pollution; acid rain and nuclear
waste, because of course sulphur
dioxide and iodine-131 are
chemicals. Maybe it is time to bring
in the marketing people to think of
a brand new image and name and
forget about calling ourselves
'engineers' at all.
Salary may be an even bigger
difference. Propsective students will
have their eyes on the kind of salary
that they will be earning on
graduating. Careers such as
accountancy or medicine offer far
higher salaries than engineering;
small wonder that university
medical courses are so hard to get
on to.
To encourage more students into
engineering courses, one way might
be to consider giving a financial
incentive for students to study
engineering. At present you receive
the same grant for an engineering
course as for studying Mediaeval
twine spinning with Serbo-Croat or
other such courses of dubious
worth. There has existed for a
number of years a National
Engineering Scholarship scheme,
which was intended to encourage
people of high calibre to pursue
engineering careers, with a financial
carrot of a £500-a-year bursary.
However, the scheme is
administered in such a way that you
would already have to have applied
to an engineering course through
UCCA before your application for a
scholarship is processed; so even if
you are unsuccessful you are
committed to pursuing an
engineering course. The scheme
therefore will only appeal to people
who were going to study
engineering anyway, and is a waste
of both taxpayers' and the industrial
sponsor's money. The rapid fall off
in engineering applications appears
to indicate that the scheme hasn't
achieved its objectives; what is
required is the certain knowledge on
applying for university places that
adequate financial support will be
received by all engineering
students.
The only other way to increase
student numbers on engineering
.courses is to lower the admission
standards which is like burning
down the house to cook the pig.
There was a lot of publicity earlier
in the summer when ' A ' level
results were published, aimed at
people whose results were worse
than required for their engineering
courses, encouraging them to
pursue their applications, as the
universities were equally desperate
to recruit students. It is not good for
the students; either the course will
have to be made easier to the
detriment of the better-ability
students or the less able students
will struggle and the drop-out rate
will increase. Maybe this is the
reason that the drop-out rate from
some engineering courses is as high
as 20% (twice the average for all
subjects). For the universities it only
satisfies the short-term objective of
filling courses; in the longer term it
could be most damaging.
Universities should not be lowering
standards required for degrees,
lower admission standards will
inevitably produce worse degree
results. This, together with an
increasing drop-out rate will reflect
very badly on the universities.
Additionally, in expending extra
effort on teaching less-able students,
teaching staff will be diverted from
more useful occupation of their
time. Finally, it represents worse
value-for-money for the taxpayer as
drop-outs from courses are an
expensive waste.
Graduates
There is a growing tendency for
graduates of engineering (and
science) to pursue careers in
financial service industries rather
than in 'engineering' as such. It is
right that graduates should be
entirely free to choose in what way
to use their degrees and what career
path to pursue; any attempt to
commit engineering graduates to a
particular career would be thoroghly
wrong, and completely against the
Government's 'free market'
philosophy. To some extent the
problem lies with engineering
degree courses; a common concern
in University departments is that
their courses may be deterring
graduates from entering
engineering as a career; however,
the problem is more that the degrees
suit their owners to such a wide
variety of careers. It is all the more
surprising that fewer people are
applying to engineering courses in
the light of this. It does seem a bit
of a waste, however, to teach people
engineering skills that they will
never use in their careers.
More graduates may be
encouraged to enter industry if
salaries were higher; however,
whatever industry can pay
graduates, accountancy firms and
merchant banks will always be able
to pay more. Ultimately this is to the
long-term detriment of the nation—
we will eventually be able to count
our wealth, but not create it.
Increasing the number of students
studying engineering may not
necessarily help the problem,
particularly if an incentive such as
increasing grants for engineering
students is used. The end result
may well be a vast increase in the
expense of engineering education
without any appreciable increase in
the flow of graduates into industry.
Without the solution of this
problem, solving the problem of
filling university engineering
courses, the subject of the new
Department of Education inquiry,
will not achieve anything useful. An
investigation into why the needs of
industry are not being met by the
graduates who have already been
trained for this purpose at great
expense would be far more useful.
As this would require the
cooperation of the Departments of
Education and of Trade and
Industry, such an investigation is
unlikely.
