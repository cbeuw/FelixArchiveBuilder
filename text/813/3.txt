The Union Snack Bar.The Union
snack bar, over the first week of
term, has shown itself to be poor
value for money. The portions are
too small to be filling and they are
more expensive than the other
College outlets. If anything the
Union Snack bar ought to be
cheaper than the College outlets. It
should be a service; unlike QT it
does not have to rip-off students to
subsidise an unprofitable refectory
service.
Nevertheless, the quality of the
food in the Snackbar is excellent. If
the problems with portion size and
price can be overcome there is no
reason why the snack bar should
not become the best food outlet in
the College.
The Main Dining Hall. When
FELIX ran a story over the Summer
about the refurbishment of the
dining hall it caused a great deal of
consternation within the Sherfield
corridors of power.
The story explained how the
Rector's wife, Clare Ash, engaged
a consultancy firm to redesign the
lighting system in the refectory. The
planned economy strip lighting,
which was already being installed,
was ousted in favour of lamps
which pointed at the ceiling and a
dimmer system. The changes put an
extra two weeks on the work and
cost an alleged extra £ 3 0 , 0 0 0
according to sources within
Sherfield.
FELIX was contacted by Mrs Ash
soon after the story had been
published. She wanted to know
who had leaked the figure to FELIX,
claiming that it was incorrect. Later,
the Rector took me aside and asked
the same question. When I refused
to answer he mentioned the name
of a Sherfield official and asked me
to nod if I had been given the
information by that official.
Let me point out here and now
that FELIX will never, under any
circumstances reveal any of its
sources. This principle of
confidentiality is fundamental to
any newspaper.

In a nail-biting finish, a team from
City & Guilds College Motor Club
won the South-East area final of the
Ford Motorsport Quiz, held last
Friday night in Tunbridge Wells.
The three man team of Adrian
Bourne (Physics 3), Richard
Balmford (Elec Eng 2) and Dave
Hobbs (Mech Eng 3) were presented
with a £100 cheque for Club funds
and each recieved a set of Ford
Motorsport glasses. They will now
go on to the Grand Final at the
Motor Show, National Exhibition
Centre, Birmingham, on the
afternoon of Sunday October 23.
About 20 teams took part in the
contest, starting with all teams
answering 40 questions. Guilds MC
top scored in this section with 28
points, thereby progressing into a
'first on the buzzer' semi-final. After
Tiddly
Imperial College Rag raised £2,698
tiddly winking along Oxford Street
on Saturday. The figure is £400 up
from last year but not quite that
reached two years ago when £3,500
was collected.
City & Guilds Union had the
greatest turnout and managed to
raise £1,271. The Royal College of
Science Union came in second place
with £1,007 followed by the Royal
School of Mines who raised £420.
The top collector was Robert
Harwood of Life Science 2 who
raised £90.60. Mr Harwood will
receive a large bottle of champagne.
Prizes are also to be awarded to
Andrew Butcher of the Royal School
of Mines and Margaret Poole of
Physics who raised £ 6 4 and £ 6 2
respectively.
| a shaky start Guilds M C came
j through to win this 10-5. The other
semi-final was convincingly won by
the British Racing and Sports Car
Club (BRSCC) South East centre by
11-5.
The final then shaped up as a
Brands Hatch benefit, with the
circuits Race Day Press Officer,
Colin Mann, leading the BRSCC,
and Adrian Bourne, who worked in
the Brands Press Office for a few
weeks in the summer, leading
Guilds M C .
The BRSCC took an early four
point lead but this was pulled back
and the teams raced neck and neck
until the score was 9-9 with only one
question remaining. A correct
interruption gave the victory and
the prizes to a rather surprised
Guilds M C team.
Computer
Security
Show
Following the recent spate of
security thefts, College Security will
be holding a demonstrarion of
computer security equipment on
Thursday in the Sherfield Building.
'Spiders', clamps, 'Securiflex' and
other devices will be on display. The
devices can be bought cheaply
through security.
'Anyone who doesn't come along
is absolutely bloody irresponsible'
said Security Officer Terry Briley.
Since FELIX last reported on the
thefts two weeks ago, three
computer printers have been stolen.
Obituary
Mr David Buckingham, a messenger
at the College, died in the Life
Sciences Department on Saturday.
Mr Buckingham, aged 57,
collapsed last Saturday morning in
the Zoology Building. The alarm
was raised by a student, and soon
after, a colleague of Mr Buckingham
arrived to administer first aid. Upon
arrival at St Stephen's Hospital Mr
Buckingham was certified dead.
°ost mortem results indicate heart
allure.
Mr David Buckingham joined the
College in the middle of last year as
a messenger. He very quickly
became a popular and highly
competent member of the
messenger staff, serving in several
departments including Beit. He was
known by all people, with whom he
worked and dealt with, as a very
helpful, calm man with a dry sense
of humour.
Before joining Imperial College Mr
Buckingham had spent all his
working life as a H G V driver, with
an immaculte driving record. He
was a very reliable man as is shown
by remaining with the same
company for twenty-six years.
STA work
to start
Contracts were exchanged last
Thursday for work to go ahead on
the new Student Travel Agents
;STA) outlet in the present
Sportshop site. The new deal is set
to earn in excess of £12,000 per
annum for the Union. The contract
follows a disagreement between IC
Union and the College over
compensation clauses in an earlier
contract. The clause in the original
contract led College Senior Assistant
Finance Officer, Mr Malcolm
Aldridge to stop work on the site
earlier this term.
The original contract held the
College liable for any compensation
due to STA in the event of an early
termination. The new contract
makes the Union and the College
responsible for compensation.
The new STA deal has forced the
temporary closure of the IC Union
Sportshop, originally situated on
the walkway. The sportshop is to
move to the Jazz Room, on the first
floor of the Union Building on a
temporary basis.
