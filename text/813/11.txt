Midnight Run
Cert 15. Empire Leicester Square.
Midnight Run is an action-comedy
adventure a la Beverly Hills Cop. It
could have been just a routine piece
of mindless Americana, but the fact
that it isn't is a credit to an excellent
script, smoothly running direction
and some truly inspired casting.
Robert De Niro plays a bounty
hunter undertaking what he
believes to be a simple assign-
ment—for $100,000 he has to return
a bail-jumping accountant, played"
by Charles Grodin (Ishtar, Woman in
Red), to Los Angeles. If all goes well
this would take just one night, a
'midnight run'. However, after the
mild mannered Grodin talks De
Niro out of a quick plane journey,
they have to contend with more
cumbersome modes of transport to
get from New York to LA. What
follows is a hilarious trek across
America, and madcap chases
involving the FBI, The Mafia and a
rival bounty hunter, who all want
their hands on the accountant.
A Fish
Called Wanda
Cert 15, Plaza Piccadilly.
One of the most satisfying films of
the year must be A Fish Called
Wanda, which manages to present
an amalgam of past and present
comedy styles.
After the disastrous flop in the
States of Clockwise, John Cleese took
time out to get the formula right—a
comedy that would appeal to both
the Americans and the British. The
result is so perfect that I can't see
anyone not liking the film.
Cleese plays barrister Archie
Leach, whose skills are required to
free George, the leader of a London
gang of jewel thieves, and the only
one of the crooked quartet who
actually knows where the gems are
stashed. Archie Leach finds himself
being seduced by Wanda Garshwitz
(Jamie Lee Curtis), and relentlessly
hounded by Otto (Kevin Kline),
Wanda's jealous bed-mate. The two
are members of the gang hoping
that Leach would lead them to the
jewels. The fourth member of the
gang is Ken Pile (Michael Palin), an
animal loving hit man.
The plot meanders between these
characters, as they try to double-
and triple-cross each other to get to
the jewels. Much of the intrigue and
De Niro: 'Ha! You can't catch me'
Grodin and De Niro are perfect
comic sparring partners, delivering
each other subtle blows of
understated humour, Grodin's
deadpan delivery and sarcastic tone
suit his character so well that it is
difficult to see anyone else playing
the part. It's nice to see Charles
Grodin getting the recognition he
deserves after wallowing in
anonimity for so long.
Many would question Robert De
Niro's wisdom in playing a role
such as this, but 'the master of the
method' doesn't put a foot wrong,
and now has proved that he can
make any role his own.
In addition to the two leads,
Yaphet Kotto (Alien, Running Man)
offers good support as an inept FBI
agent, who thinks he's really cool,
but manages to always stay one step
behind the rest.
Some solid yet fast moving
direction from Martin Brest (Beverly
Hills Cop) results in" a good,
entertaining film.

Kevin Kline feeds Michael Palin some fish and chips
humour lies in the interplay and
diversity of the four main
characters. Cleese is the respectable
lawyer, bored with his life, tired of
being British and finding a release
in the form of Wanda. Wanda
seduces everyone in sight to try and
get hold of the jewels. Ken Pile is a
chronic stutterer, given the job of
'doing away with' a little old lady
who witnessed the crime, but to his
anguish he disposes of her three
dogs instead. But the most over-the-
top performance comes from Kevin
Kline, the unstable ex-CIA man
Otto, who hates the British, 'they
get rigor mortis in the prime of life
here', exclaims the man who thinks
the London Underground is a
political movement, and reads the
works of the well known Belgian
philosopher Aristotle!
The comparisons between the
English and the Americans furnish
many of the best moments and
complement a very solid plot.
It has been said that this film has
resurrected the style of the Ealing
comedies of the sixties. If Ealing
comedies were ever this good they
would never have died out.

track 29
Metro (Piccadilly Circus tube)
A strange and confusing film which
serves up some interesting
moments but becomes lost in its
own intricacies and attempts at
exploring the human mind.
A North Carolina geriatrician,
Christopher Lloyd (Back to the
Future, Taxi), is so obsessed with his
model train set that he ignores the
sexual pleas of his wife Theresa
Russell (Black Widow). She is saved
from suicide by the appearance of
a crazy Englishman, Gary Oldman,
who claims to be her long lost son.
Fiery arguments and sexual
innuendoes follow as Russell
rapidly loses her mind—is Oldman
simply a figment of her warped
imagination?
Certainly something different
from director Nicholas Roeg but a
movie only to be seen if, for some
reason, you want to spend an
evening in a confused state of mind
yourself.

The Yob
The Comic Strip
What are these Comic Strip people
on?
Patrick Church is a cocaine
sniffing, pretentious jerk with an
attachable girlfriend to match.
Steven Kendall is a man with a
walnut for a brain.
The two of them stumble into a
time machine in the laboratory of a
mad scientist in a Fly-type
experiment and the consequences of
this gradually transform the two
into absurd caricatures of each other
to the amazement and distress of
the people around them. Church
develops the need to adorn toilet
walls with the name of his favourite
football team and shocks his
girlfriend with comments such as
'You love it really, doncha?'. The
transformation is complete when
the single braincell Kendall thinks
he is the second coming and Church
develops neanderthal features and
the word 'love' appears tattooed on
his fist.
No one could have done this
better than the Comic Strip team. In
fact no one could even have thought
of it apart from them. And it is
completely brilliant', say no more.
