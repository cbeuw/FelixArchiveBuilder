Had William Shakespeare written
Measure for Measure not as a play but
a serial, it would quite definitely
have been done for the Saturday
matinees of the thirties. The
scriptwriter's unfair trick of writing
a cliffhanger and then producing an
ace, generally a re-write in the next
episode is employed several times
in the course of this story.
Shakespeare finds himself in a
tight corner, writes his way in, and
then shows us a secret exit, in the
form of a new character. Bad
planning followed by inventiveness
maybe, but the story is good enough
all the same, and it goes like this.
Cinventio, the Duke, takes his
leave of Vienna and puts Angelo in
the driving seat for a while. Angelo,
one of the moral majority, invokes
strict laws concerning common
decency, and as a result imprisons
Claudio for the common indecency
of getting his fiancee pregnant.
Claudio has a friend, Lucio, who
also claims to have a bastard
somewhere, and not wishing to see
the downfall of his soul mate agrees
to seek help. This comes in the form
of Isabella, Claudio's sister, who

What is happening? Why is there a
review of a cook book in the Arts
pages? Is Yishu Nanda taking over
the entire paper?
I can give you the answer to the
first two questions, but as for the
last—I just don't know.
This is a very good book. It is
particularly aimed at a market of
novice cooks/vegetarians, which
must include a lot of students, and
hence qualifies me to write the
review. It contains a wide range of
simple, quick to prepare, tasty
recipes, as well as plenty of useful
advice on the basics of cooking it all.
There are also a few wacky recipes
containing substances such as
wakem, whatever that may be, if
you're feeling a wee bit
adventurous. The author also uses
a system of simple notation for
various aspects of each recipe, such
stops short of joining a nunnery to
visit Angelo and plead for Claudio's
life. Angelo, being the considerate
bloke he is, suggests a deal be
struck, swapping Claudio's neck for
Isabella's virginity. It's a toughie but
she refuses, knowing her brother
will face death like a man. He takes
the news badly though.
Episode two. The Duke reappears
in disguise, and uncovers all this
terrible double dealing. Enter
as length of preparation time,
freezability, and suitability for
vegans (this gets a thumbs up from
the 'right-on' lobby), which I found
very clear and useful.
On the minus side, I feel that Mrs
Elliot sometimes does make things
a little too simplistic, particularly
with the varieties of ingredients that
are used, but this is only a small
quibble. The book is solidly aimed
at a market, and it fulfills that aim
very well indeed. For me, it means
that I will no longer have to ring my
mother ten minutes before a girl is
due to arrive for a romantic tete-a-
tete to find out how long to cook the
broccoli. For you, if you want a
good, simple cookbook that you will
use a lot: you'll be pushed to find
better.

Mariana. Who? She's Angelo's
deserted fiancee, our first invented
character. The Duke persuades
Isabella to agree to Angelo's filthy
suggestions and let Mariana then go
in her place. Angelo demands to see
Claudio's head the next morning, all
the same.
Episode three. Enter Bernadine.
Who now? He is also to be executed
that day, and his head sent in place
of Claudio's to fool Angelo.

Most people survive College one
way or another, finding their feet in
their own way and in their own
time. So what is the point of a book
that tells you how to go about it? Is
it really going to be of any use
especially when it deals with
subjects such as 'The College
Experience', 'Pass Those Exams—
And Stay Human' and 'Sex, Love
and Dreams'!?
Whilst this book does tend to state
the obvious at times it sets out in a
simple, readable format many of the
problems Joe Student can expect to
come across in his or her years at
College. It starts out with a general
introduction to what College and
the people there can do to, or for,
you and then continues with
accommodation, subjects and
options, time management and
generally gives tips on how to get
Unfortunately, he refuses to be
executed and returns to his cell.
Damn! We need a third new
character, Ragozine, a pirate who,
luckily, died that morning anyway.
At last we can finish everything
off tidily, with no new players to be
seen. The Duke reveals himself and
dishes out all the true justice he can,
measure for measure.
The play spends its first half
heading on what is certain to be the
path towards a tragedy. The clever
plot of the Duke turns this into a
comedy however, and despite a sad
rebuttal of the Duke at the end, as
a whole the play is amusing and
happily entertaining.
The acting is excellent all round,
particularly the portrayal of the
Duke by Roger Allan. Josette Simon
(Isabella) and John Shrapnell
(Angelo) are outstanding and had
the entire audience enthralled.
The setting is somewhat
confusing, being approximately turn
of the century. A number of
anachronisms—office furniture,
punk clothing, a Bic disposable pen,
air conditioning pipes—make the
whole production a touch puzzling
though. Perhaps it is meant as an
indication of the timelessness of the
moral of the piece, whatever that
may be. Well, perhaps?
I can thoroughly recommend this
as a good night out. It's easy to
follow and, at £5 for student stand-
by, pretty cheap too.

the most out of all aspects of
university life.
It is all obvious enough when
you've read it but then again the
same can be said for most things in
life and to have a book which
concisely points this out is useful.
Written in a note format it is the sort
of book that can be dipped into
when required rather than a text-
book in which finding the
information is a task in itself. It also
has useful suggestions for further
reading if needs require.
For any student who likes to have
an organised life and for whom
problems can be a problem this book
is well worth looking at. Those who
couldn't care less and sail on
without ever seeming to worry
about anything will probably not
have read this far into the review
and so will survive anyway.
