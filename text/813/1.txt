Students Hold Out
on Hall Fees
Students in Fisher Hall have decided to hold a rent protest after claims
of 'a deliberate attempt to mislead' them over their rents by the Student
Accommodation Office. A meeting of 90 or so students in the Fisher Hall
Common room decided to pay rent for eleven weeks only at last year's
rates. Rents in Fisher Hall have increased drastically since last year after
the rooms were reappraised for rent purposes. Students are also expected
to pay rent for an extra week in the Christmas holiday.
Fisher Hall residents have the letters sent out to Freshers
distributed a sheet outlining their
dismay at the rent increases, which
they claim they were unaware of
before moving in. The sheet outlines
how much students should pay if
they disagree with paying higher
rents this year. They have also
drawn up a standard letter to
enclose with a reduced payment.
Senior Assistant Finance Officer,
Mr Malcolm Aldridge told FELIX he
was 'glad that they are paying what
they think to be the reasonable
amount' rather than paying
nothing.
asked, she claimed. Mrs
O'Callaghan admitted, however,
that the failure to indicate a rent on
before they arrived did leave her at
fault. She defended the £40 single
room rent in Fisher Hall, saying
Accommodation Officer Loretto
O'Callaghan said she did not intend
to mislead students. She added that
the postal strike had forced her staff
to telephone students in Britain,
informing them that they had a
room. To save time and money,
students were not told their rent
over the telephone unless they
'Does anybody think £40 is a lot to
spend on a room in Central
London?...! don't'
ICU President Nigel Baker, part of
whose responsbilities lie with
Loretto O'Callaghan Accommodation Officer
accommodation, said of the protest
T think it has been done in a very
responsible way'. He added that he
did not support the protest and
pointed out that if the Fisher Hall
residents do not pay the increased
rents, rent increases will be greater
still across the board next year.
Mr Baker hopes to be able to
compensate for the extra week's
rent in the next academic year. He
has suggested a change in term
dates to give students at IC a 31
week academic year. At present,
students working over 30 weeks can
claim for an extra week's grant. The
proposal, which Mr Baker hopes to
take to the College's Governing
Body, will set term dates to start
mid-week. Mr Baker explained that
students already work a 31 week
year. The new plans should not
increase the length of the year, he
claimed.
Students in College
accommodation are now expected to
pay twelve weeks' rent this term in
spite of the term lasting eleven
weeks. This change was decided by
the Student Residence Committee
(SRC) in June and was taken into
account in the rent increases,
according to Senior Assistant
Finance Officer, Mr Aldridge.
Mr Aldridge went on to explain
that the rents and the twelve week
rent for this term were authorised
by the rector in July. The extra
week's rent means that students will
be able to use their rooms as
storerooms or accommodation foi>
the three weeks over the Christmas.
In previous years, residents have
been required to place their
belongings in store rooms or take
them home over the Christmas
vacation.
Rag Mag
Withdrawn
IC Rag Mag Editor, Dave Williams
has withdrawn this year's Rag Mag
after storming out of a heated
discussion on its sale and censorship
at the Rag meeting last Friday. Mr
Williams is concerned by the Rag
Committee's proposal to ask
Universities for permission before
selling the Rag Mag on their
campuses. The move comes amidst
complaints from several Rag
Committee members that the
committee has become isolated by
'rag-hackdom'.
Mr Williams told FELIX that the
Rag Committee plan to send copies
of the Rag Mag to the Charities they
collect for. 'It's quite possibly the
most ridiculous idea I've ever
heard,' he said. He claims that the
Charities would be shocked by the
content of the Rag Mag, even if it
were heavily censored. He added
that he has said all along he is
'prepared to take some cuts.'
Mr Williams went on to say that
although he was prepared to accept
some censorship of the Rag Mag, he
was not prepared to contact
Universities in advance of its sale.
He claims other Universities will not
bother to look at the Rag Mag.
Instead, he says, they will refuse
permission for the sale of Rag Mags
on their campuses, on the basis of
'Imperial bashing'.
Rag Committee Chairman, Fiona
Nicholas, told FELIX that she saw
no problem in persuading other
Universities to take the Rag Mag.
'When I went to the Rag Conference
last January, they all wanted to buy
our Rag Mags,' she said. Miss
Nicholas now wants Mr Williams to
take the new Rag Mag to this year's
