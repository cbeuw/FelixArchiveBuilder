Alternative
What a crap summer, eh! What an
absolute England football team
performance of a summer. Where
are we going to sell this bloody
country to the frigging EEC and
move to Barbados? And any of you
gits who went abroad this year, I
hope you all get skin cancer and get
exiled to a North Sea oil rig.
And what about the smegging
Olympics, more like 'Miami
sodding Vice'. 'On the inside it's
Linford Christie who's got a good
start, but Lewis, in seventh is
cathing him, but forging ahead in
lane eight it's Ben 'smackhead'
Johnson. Oh, but who's this on the
far outside, in lane nine in a silver-
grey Pontiac with a matching grey
speckled designer suit, half-inch
stubble and sunglasses. My God,
it's Ben's brother Don, and he's
pulling his gun out and.. .goodness
gracious he's just ventilated Ben
Johnson's brain and the flying bone
has blinded Carl Lewis, who trips
and breaks his leg and...oh
no...catastrophe, Christie's lower

leg has been grazed! But he
manages to clamber over in first
place—remarkable—this is
wonderful. Due to the fact that
Christie's mates have been
respectively violently killed and
blinded, Christie get the gold and
Don Johnson qualifies for the
shooting final, as long as judges
don't deduct points for Johnson's tie
clashing with his socks. But, of
course, there has been as tragic side
to this race as well. Christie graze
and chance at a two year ban may
impede his chances in the 200m'.
String the whole smegging lot up!
Mind you, I used to do drugs.
Though I could handle it, y'know
what I mean. Just sTSrted off with
a bit of 'Dallas' some 'Dynasty' and
even some 'Colbys' now and again.
Then I went down hill, 'Knot's
Landing', 'Falcon Crest' and
eventually the biweeklys—
'Eastenders', 'Brookside', etc. And
then the bottom dropped out—I
started doing 'Neighbours, once
even twice a day. Lost all my friends
(naturally), my money, through
buying endless supplies of Kylie
Minogue records and started to
suffer horrendous withdrawal
symptoms over the weekends. I'd
be irritable, and tell everyone to
'Rack Off. I pleaded with the BBC

to show an Omnibus edition, but
the uncaring bastards wouldn't
budge. To compensate, I started
experimenting with 'Eastenders'
omnibus and even "The Flying
Doctors'. It was after I'd had a
relapse during work (when I
attacked a man similar to Dirty Den
for having forced Damon's wife
Daphne to have an abortion). I was
sent to the Mary Whitehouse School
of Correction. Anyway, I'm better
now. But who do I blame—I blame
Thatcher, for refusing to legalise
'Brookside'. I mean, it's only the
thrill of breaking the law that tempts
most people into this shady scene,
and it's no worse than 'Coronation
Street' and 'Eastenders' and they've
been legal for year! So write to your
local MP and make a complete twat
of yourself.
And while we're on the subject
what about the bloody Channel
Tunnel? There's Maggie whinging
on about the bloody Europeans and
the sodding Frenchies are almost
here, while the hardworking,
trustworthy honest and non-sexist
British labourers have hardly made
a dent. They're all down there
saying 'Oh I don't know, it's going
to be a tricky job. 1993 yer say. Ooh,
dodgy, dodgy, may have to work a
few weekends which will cost a lot

of extra dosh, y'know what I mean?'
And the small dent they have
made would have been made a hell
of a lot bloody quicker if they'd used
lorries to clear away the dirt, instead
of hiding it down their trousers.
Anyway, I'm tired of moaning, so
I'll leave yqu with a satirical
comment:
Q: Why did the chicken cross the
road? A: So that he could join the
National Guard.
