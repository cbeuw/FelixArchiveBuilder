Rag Conference in January. When
explaining why she wanted to
contact Universities in advance she
said she did not want their sale to
clash with other colleges' Rag
efforts. 'I'd be bloody pissed off if
somebody came on our campus
selling Rag Mags during our Rag
Week,' she added.
Mr Williams was accompanied by
Mr Simon Bradshaw when he left
the meeting last Friday. Both Mr
Bradshaw and Mr Williams are
upset by the attitudes of the Rag
Committee. 'Any Freshers who had
come to it would never come to a
Rag meeting again/ said Mr
Bradshaw. 'We seem to have lost
sight of the main aim of Rag which
is to collect money for charity,' he
added.
Following a letter from ICU
President, Nigel Baker, Mr Williams
has dispelled rumours ihat the
Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU) planned to fund the Rag
Mag. The letter from Mr Baker
explained that if such a funding
were to go ahead he would insist
upon the removal of all references
to Imperial College Union and ICU
Rag. In the letter, Mr Baker also
expressed concern over the effects
of the funding upon the RCSU
clubs' finances. Mr Williams pointed
out that such a funding would be a
loan from the RCSU finances, and
would not affect the clubs. He
denied any moves to fund the
publication by RCSU.
Mr Williams still hopes to be able
to produce a Rag Mag in time for
Rag Week in four weeks. Most of
the sales of the mag come from Rag
Week. He concluded however that
the Rag Committee 'are really Wiling
the spirit of Rag ', and added that
'Rag's about getting everybody out
on the street and having a good
time.'
MSF Strike
Vote
The Manufacturing, Science and
Finance Trade Union (MSF) voted
last week to take industrial action on
the 18th of October, to implement
other industrial action other than
stoppages and to^take further
industrial action'in the future,
following a national ballot. Ninety
per cent of those who voted at IC
agreed to strike.
Imperial College MSF intends to
organise picketing around the
college, a protest motorcade, a
massive balloon release and also
bands and speakers. Mr. John
Fecamp of IC MSF said "The idea
is to use the day as a massive
display of protest."
The move follows an independent
report made jointly by MSF and the
universities. The report was
assessed by Sir Peter Matthews
(chairman of the Armed Forces and
Nurses Pay Review bodies) which
concluded that university pay was
18% below the equivalent in
industry. The trade unions are
unhappy that the Government and
universities have decided not to act
on the report.
Welfare
Officer
The University of London Union
has rejected plans to employ a joint
IC Union/ULU Welfare Adviser.
The scheme was described as
'unfeasable', and the two unions are
planning to appoint their own
separate welfare advisers
ICU President Nigel Baker told
FELIX that he hopes to appoint an
adviser within a fortnight, to start
work towards the end of the term.
ULU are now initiating their own
welfare service.
Mr Baker was initially told that the
College would replace the part-time
Welfare Adviser Linda Simmons
when she left in March this year.
Since the post covers problems
concerning Social Security Benefits,
Grants and many other areas, it was
felt that a full-time adviser was the
best solution. College Secretary,
John Smith agreed to a
reappointment on a part-time basis
after a letter from Mr Baker in June.
Mr Baker used the appointment of
an assistant/secretary to Mrs Clare
Ash, the Rector's wife, in the HUB
office as a bargaining point in the
letter. At the time of Linda
Simmons' departure from the post
of Welfare Adviser, College Policy
was not to replace staff. The
Assistant/ Secretary was employed
in direct contravention of this policy.
The HUB Office has had an increase
of £10,000 for its annual finances.
A letter from Irene Addison-
Child, U L U Research and Training
Officer, was sent to Mr Baker in
June, asking for advice and
information about welfare services
at IC. Mr Baker wrote to Mr Jackson,
proposing the idea of a joint-adviser
on August 25. He stressed the
urgency of the situation since ICU
was planning to instate the adviser
by the beginning of this term.
Nothing was done until Mr Baker
rang Mr Jackson, calling for a
meeting to discuss the matter.
When questioned about the delay
and lack of response, Mr Jackson
blamed the postal strike.
A meeting was held on September
15 at which Mr Jackson and Mr
Baker were present along with other
ULU sabbaticals and ULU Senior
Administrator, Peter Anwyl. During
a discussion after the meeting, at
which Mr Baker was not present,
the proposal for a joint-adviser was
rejected by ULU due to 'the simply
unfeasible and unrealistic' time
scale.
ULU also cited the possibility of
the scheme conflicting with their
'developing welfare strategy.'This
strategy includes a 'network of
student welfare volunteers, at least
in the immediate future.' When
asked about present volunteer
numbers Mr Jackson was not able to
confirm any and apologised for the
failure of the Union to send a
briefing document on their welfare
policy. Mr Jackson is in charge of
welfare at ULU. Ms Addison-Childs
told FELIX that no volunteer
recruitment had taken place.
And finally..
The loss of the Lexham Gardens
Head Tenancies at the end of last
year has led to a shortage of places
in College accommodation. Several
cases of severe hardship have been
brought to the attention of FELIX.
Not least of these is the former
resident (pictured below) who,
unable to find alternative
accommodation, is now forced to
share an office with ICU Honorary
Secretary Ian Morris.
