speak of none other but the ancient
art of relieving students and
members of the public of their
money to benefit those less well oft
than ourselves. In other words Rag.
Before I begin to talk about a subject
about which, for all you know, I
may have no knowledge of'
whatsoever, I'll provide a couple of,
credentials; I have been a member
of Rag Committee (co-opted) for the
last three years, organised several
Rag events including the '88 Rag
Fete, and personally raised over
Â£700 last year.
The problems Rag is currently
facing are exemplified by the saga!
of IC Rag Mags, this year'sl
included. Since I started at IC in the1
83-84 session (i.e. six years ago) two
Rag Mags have been stillborn due
to 'censorship' problems, we have
published one of the best the
country has seen (the 83-84 edition),
another good one (85-86) made the
national press due to jokes about the
Bradford City fire, and we had a
panic production last year of a
substandard product because the
original was both too small and
lacked almost any quality
whatsoever. All of these Rag Mags
were sold in public on the streets at
some point, and one, the 85-86, was
in fact banned by the Exec (after
several thousand pounds had been
spent on printing) only to be
unbanned at a U G M . And now this
year's edition, after much
confusion, seems to be teetering on
the brink between banning or
release. At this stage I begin to
wonder what a Rag Mag is for, and
why we bother producing one.
Produced by students
it contains student
humour necessarily of
a specialised nature
The first thing a Rag Mag is for is
to raise money for charity. It is
produced by students and contains
student humour, necessarily of a
specialised nature. If you go to the
bar and hear some of the stories told
there they will be rude, offensive to
some, contain 'bad language' and
be sexually explicit. This is all part
and parcel of student humour, and,
as a collection of student humour,
a Rag Mag MUST contain these
elements. You might otherwise just
reprint an already existing public
joke book! But it is these very same
elements that members of the
general public will find offensive.
I'm sure part of the reason why
these jokes are funny to the anarchic
student populace is tht many would
find them offensiveJJhese elements
are also those that censorship
committees would remove the
principal elements of student
humour.
produced, don't even try to publish
at all. The existence of the
censorship committee really implies
that the people who elect the Rag
Mag Editor, namely all of you out
there, are incomeptent and not to be
trusted with your choice. If that's
the case then don't hide it behind
the pretence of a committee on
'censorship'. Have a proper
editorial board and get the Mag put
together by the sabbaticals, Rag
Chairman and helpers. This is in fact
more or less what heppened last
year, and the result, while still a Rag
Let's look at the job of the Rag
Mag editors. They spend a summer,
or in some cases much longer,
making jokes up, compiling them
from friends, extorting articles from
people. Producing this stuff is a long
and thankless task, and typesetting
and pasting-up are worse. But it's
If you elect an Editor
let them edit
not really their product at all. The
final say about what goes in is up
to the censorship committee, in our
case the Rag Chairman, the Editor
and the three Union Sabbaticals.
They have total say on what goes in
or out. They are, in fact, really an
editorial board, with the people who
do all the work more like sub-
- editors, subject to the whim and
fancy of the committee, who have
no conception of the blood, sweat,
tears and time that go into as large
a creative effort as a Rag Mag. If you
elect an editor, let them edit; if you
don't trust them, don't elect them,
and if you don't like what might be
Mag, was a much paler effort than
IC has seen for many a year.
A solution to most of these
problems is to make sure that
people who will appreciate the
content are the ones who will get
the Rag Mag, and those who will be
offended will not. In other words
sell it to students, and not on the
street. (Incidentally, the Rag Raids
last year which were intended to sell
Rag Mags to general punters on the
streets turned more into street
collections since there isn't much
market for Rag Mags to the general
public anyway!). This proposal
seems to have mutated somewhat

since it was made last year. The
most ridiculous thing I have heard
so far this year is the new decision
that the Rag Mag should be sent to
the supported charities before
approval. This presents several
problems. Firstly, the directors of
charities are usually the pillars of the
establishment which much of Rag
Mag humour seeks to undermine.
Of course they won't like it.
Secondly, is the issue of our
independence. We are raising
money for these charities, not acting
as subsidiaries of them under their
full control. If this principle is
extended, we will be sending the
charities the whole of our Rag
programme for approval, in the
possible event that they find one or
two little bits of it not to their taste.
This should of course include the
scripts of Smoking Concert
sketches, the strange costumes
worn on collections, and just about

everything else. Would the
Children's Day charities really
approve of someone collecting in
their name by doing a strip tease in
front of Eros as Fiona Nicholas, this
year's Rag Chairman, did last year?

children (Nigel Baker, last year's
Rag Chairman, and this year's
President took part in this)? And
what about the other activities that
happen during Rag Events? Would
Guide Dogs for the Blind really
want to take money from a group
of students who rampage around
the country stealing traffic signs as
well as collecting? Nigel has
certainly been involved with, nay
actively encouraged, such acts of
vandalism.
These charities are, of course, only
too grateful to accept the money we
give them, but if they start having
to take responsibility for some of our
actions by, for example okaying a
publication, they are obviously
going to be more reluctant about
things. If they don't know, they
don't care, but force them to take
note and they will cover their legal
backs as much as possible. Is this,
perhaps, what this move is all
about? Nigel's address to the
Freshers on the first day of term
included a fine recommendation
that we should be realistic in our
outlooks. Yet he and Fiona are
showing a distinct lack of realism
here. The only realistic outcome of
