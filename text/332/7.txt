The writing is clearly on the wall for all students
everywhere. There are meaningful questions out-
side science to extend your mind, and one example
shown above is taken from the wall of the beer
pressure reliever at Silwood Park, that well-known
country haven of Imperial College.
After the Flintstones came the Touchstones, and
after the Touchstones came me. A college career
of idle curiosity almost behind me, I dared venture
forth to brain-crippling pursuits elsewhere.
"This is your last chance, son, take it and they'll
make a man of you."
M y curiosity has been satisfied, I now know that
I should never have gone to Touchstone. Had I gone
in my first, my second, or even early in my third
year, it would have been a good idea, but all in all
the experience is far too enjoyable for anyone to go
if they will not have the chance to go again.
The "coachload of pseuds" can be simply
divided into two parts, those who go to take an
active part in the discussion and those who go be-
cause a weekend of good food, good drink and
good surroundings appeals to them. Both groups
returned well satisfied. The latter group slept off
their vices during the discussion. They missed a
lot.
At the last Touchstone we were graced with two
guest speakers who promoted discussion on the
subject of "Human Rights", a subject so wide-
spread in relevance that everybody got a chance to
mount their own personal hobby-horse. The two
speakers were Professor Raphael, Director of Asso-
ciated Studies at Imperial College (in case you
didn't know) and Professor Costa, of the University
of Rome. Unfortunately Professor Costa was banned
from achieving the full potential of his contribution
by virtue of language difficulties, but Professor
Raphael's expert handling of the discussion and
willingness to supply Professor Costa with the mot
juste at necessary times much ground was covered
in keen discussion. I at least felt that I had seen
many different points of view which I had never
previously considered.
The discussion centred around the "Universal
Declaration of Human Rights" adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on Decem-
ber 10th, 1948. Each member country of the United
Nations is now pledged to "cause the text of the
Declaration to be disseminated, displayed, read and
compounded principally in schools and other edu-
cational institutions, without distinction based on
the political status of countries or territories".
Think about the implications of that. Interesting?
Then Touchstone is for you also. Boring? Then Pro-
fessor Raphael and Mr. McDowell are back in Col-
lege Block and keen to hear what you would
like out of General Studies. I would like to have
been persuaded to go to Touchstone sooner. Oh! In
case you're worried, then Touchstoners are a
friendly bunch too, but watch out for the Australian
snooker player . . . he'll beat you.

After a lifetime of considering the eternal u n -
answerable " W h a t is L i f e ? " , " I s there a p u r p o s e ? " ,
" W h a t d o W e m e a n ? " I have, finally, d i s c a r d e d
philosophy, for I have discovered a question more
profound than a n y of these, — deeper a n d harder
to discern even than the immortal " W h y ? " If I c a n
find an answer to this question, I w i l l die a happy
man — but I fear I never shall. M y question? " W h y
do people compete in 2 4 Hour Pedal C a r R a c e s ? "
The 8 t h National Pedal C a r Race w a s h e l d at
W h i t c h u r c h Airfield last week-end (3 p . m . F r i d a y —

cars — two from guilds (Hurrah, Rah-Rah-Rah,

meant to be impartial) a n d o n e from M i n e s . U n -

The race w a s started w i t h the customary " L e

T A X
Sheffield University students' Union has re-
cently sent me a letter giving information
about one of the proposed changes in the tax-
ation system.
It has been suggested that Family Allow-
ances and tax allowances for children should
be replaced by a single tax credit which is
given to the father. Students are excluded
from the tax credit system and so students at
present receiving Family Allowances may lose
this income.
If you would like to support the Child Pov-
erty Action Group campaign for payment of
Child credits to the mother, in the same way
as Family Allowances are at present, the ad-
dress to write to is: Child Poverty Action
Group, 1 Macklin Street, Drury Lane, London
W C 2 B 5NH.
If you prefer you may write direct to: The
Clerk, Select Committee on Tax Credits,
House of Commons, London SW1.
I hope this information is of use to some of
you.

classic case of bending failure — w h i c h called for
an hour's w e l d i n g (only, alas, the first of many).
The hours of pedalling passed, a n d a l l the I.C.
cars seemed to be doing fairly well until, near M i d -
night " B i g B o " split her (his?) c r a n k s h a f t — a n d

" B o B e l l e " w a s patched up in a couple of hours
work, but " B i g B o " w a s too far gone to mend until
fresh w e l d i n g apparatus became available the next
morning.
So the pedalling went o n , — through the hours
of darkness to the sunlight, a n d on to the afternoon.

ICU FLATS
A t present Imperial College U n i o n rents twelve flats
in Hamlet Gardens, Ravenscourt Park, W 6 , and one
flat in Cambridge Gardens, Ladbroke Grove, sub-letting
these to its members. The flats house eighty-nine stud-
ents i n total, seven at Cambridge Gardens, and the rest
at Hamlet Gardens i n flats of varying sizes, the majority
accommodating seven persons. A l l the flats are self-
contained with a lounge, kitchen and bathroom(s).
Rents, considering there is no subsidy, are competitive,
electricity and gas being extra at the standard rate. T h e
lease for the property at Hamlet Gardens is subject,
unfortunately, to annual negotiation. This, of course,
enables the landlords to demand a higher rental each
time, however, i n view of the 1 0 % increase last year
and the better prospects for summer letting, it is reason-
ably certain that rents will remain at the same level.
Nothing need be said here about the grants situation,
save that any increase i n flat rental would be extremely
unwelcome, especially as the cost of non-College accom-
modation will no doubt make its usual upward move-
ment next session.
Economically it is crucial that the scheme does not
finish its second year i n the red, as it d i d its mis-man-
aged first. A s electricity and gas are now paid for by
those who use them, the only possible source of deficit
is the rent. This year rents were evaluated o n the basis
of a forty-eight week year—that is we could have a l l
flats standing empty for four weeks and just break
even. The only time that this could possibly happen
is over the summer vacation, hence, it has been decided
to offer anybody occupying a place over the vacation
a place next session, providing they apply by the end
of the week. This offer may be extended indefinitely
depending on demand. Another way to achieve full
occupancy over the summer is to let to non-members
of the Union—this was done last year, but only to a
small extent. Needless to say, U n i o n members will
have preference. A n y surplus could be used i n a num-
ber of ways, probably the most constructive being to
offset future rent increases.
A s far as lettings next session are concerned, the
allocation of places will be made i n the fairest possible
manner, that of first come first served. However, group
applications for whole flats will be favoured as experi-
ence has shown that such flats are more desirable in
all aspects than those randomly filled. In order to avoid
a repeat of the chaos last summer, person or persons
accepting the offer of a room or flat will be required
to cancel immediately any application for H a l l or
House. Transfer of places is i n general not a fair prac-
tice when there is a waiting list, so except i n special
cases this will not be permitted.
Application forms for vacational and sessional letting
and further details of rents, etc., are available now from
the U n i o n Office. Applications will be accepted indefin-
itely in view of the possibility of further flats being avail-
able next session, but a large demand is expected, so
remember that early applications will be favoured.
