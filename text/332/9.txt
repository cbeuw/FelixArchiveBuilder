STUDENTS DAY OF ACTION
This siis part of the national student campaign for higher
grants. For the f i r s t time in the history of N.U.S. i t has
called for a national stoppage of a l l colleges.
As far as Imperial College i s concerned there is going to be a s
strike of lectures this Wednesday morning. An alternative syllabus
and a play have been arranged for the morning (for details see
overleaf) and a surprise event is planned for the afternoon.
There are not many of us who regard the grants situation as
acceptable. The Government, The Daily Telegraph, through to the
Morning Star have a l l recognised our demands as reasonable
but the Government is loathe to take immediate action.
The main points of the grants campaign arc
abolition of the means test
- restoration of the grant to i t s 1962 level
- end discrimination against women, in that they should get a
f u l l grant whether or not they are married
an annual review is needed to protect students against
inflation, with a view to introducing some supplementary
grant to compensate for inflation
The government has had four months to consider the N.U.S. grants
claim* Students are sick and tired of the government's delaying
tactics. W
e cannot afford to wait while the mandarins of Whitehall
"look" at our campaign.
ALL OUT - MARCH 14TH
