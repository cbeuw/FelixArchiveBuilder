Perhaps the N.U.S.
claim of £100 on the basic
grant plus £60 London
weighting is modest, or
perhaps, as some respon-
dents think, it should only
be £78 to be within the
limits of phase II. What-
ever you think, a fuller
discussion of P . G . views
will be very useful.
A p a r t from the finan-
cial problems of P.G.'s
whilst healthy, the situa-
tion could be far worse if
they suffered injury dur-
ing their course. Postgrad-
uate students are not i n -
sured against accident
during their course of stu-
dies at I.C. The College
Calender gives the follow-
ing information.
" T h e college authorities
accept no liability for ac-
cidents to students while
pursuing any part of their
course . . . . and they re-
commend that students
should take steps to insure
themselves against acci-
dents. Postgraduate stu-
dents, particularly if mar-
ried, are advised to contri-
bute to National Insur-
ance."
If any week a postgra-
duate undertakes paid de-
monstrating, a contribu-
tion is made by the college
for injury insurance, and
he is then covered against
injury whilst he is demon-
strating, but at no other
time. If a student does
contribute to the National
Insurance Scheme (at a
cost of £51.48 p.a.) he
receives scarcely any be-
nefits while a student.
What the student
is most likely to need is
some form of sickness or
injury benefit. A s a non-
employed person he
would not be eligible for
this . under the National
Insurance scheme.
It is the S.R.C.'s nor-
mal practice, when a stu-
dent is away from work
owing to illness or injury,
to continue his studentship
at the full rate of pay for
the first four weeks and
at half rate for the next
four weeks. After that t h e
student must depend on
his savings, his family, or
as a last resort, social se-
curity. A student who
permanently injures him-
self in the course of his
studies can obtain no com-
pensation unless he has
himself taken out a per-
sonal injury policy or can
prove that the injury re-
sulted from another per-
son's negligence. In the
latter case he could obtain
compensation by sueing
the college but this is a
lengthy and costly busi-
ness. Clearly great hard-
ship could easily arise.
The reputation of Imp-
erial College depends very
much on the quantity and
the quality of research
that is carried out there.
The college receives large
research contracts and
grants from industry and
the government. Most of
this research is carried
out by post-graduates and
yet the coilege, despite a l l
the benefits it reaps from
this work, is not prepared
to provide cover against
accident for the oostera-

that the college authorities
recognise the value of
postgraduate work and
provide insurance cover

whilst working at Imper-
ial College.
Some of the other topics
to be discussed are the
provision of more coffee
services and common
rooms, the standard of ca-
tering, the leak of U.G./
P.G. contacts, their typing
and binding costs and the
inefficiency of College
beaurocracy. These are
all subjects which were i n
evidence in the comments
section of the question-
naire and which could be
the basis of a further
questionnaire to find out
more of what people think
T o quote a few of the
comments:—
"Virtually any major
university (But of course
not I * * * C) has continu-
ous cafeteria service dur-
ing a normal student day
(8 a.m. 11 p.m.). W h y
doesn't the A D M I N I S -
T R A T I O N G E T O F F
ITS * * * A R S E . "
"The inclusion of the
cost of producing a thesis
only enhances the require-
ment that research stud-
ents must obtain part-
time work, which is prov-
ing hard to find."
'On the question of
whether P.G.'s are stud-
ents or employees . . . .
conditions would be vastly
improved if we were em-
ployees."
"I feel strongly that
there is not enough sense
of Postgraduate C o m m u -
nity . . . in the College
as a whole."
"Grants should include
National Insurance Con-
tributions for a l l stud-
ents."
" T h e food supplied in
the whole of the College is
unbelievably bad. W h y
doesn't the U n i o n run its
own catering service."
With reference to the
last point, there must be
P.G.'s at I.C. who be-
tween them have spent 3
years at nearly every U n i -
versity in the country.
Therefore we should be
able to establish whether
I.C. catering really is the
worst, which is better than
only having R . C . A . as a
comparison.
But what we really
need, more than anything
else, is a community,
where we can work to-
gether, pool our knowledge
improve I.C., improve our
position and make P . G .
education worthwhile.
Whatever you think,
take time off on Wednes-
day morning at 11 a.m.

By our Entomological Affairs Reporter
Last week F E L I X revealed that the cockroach and
mouse problem in halls and refectories had reached
such epidemic proportions that it was necessary for the
college to spend 0,350 on cleaning the kitchens to try
and rid IC of its unwanted menu additions (see R C S
Broadsheet "Mice Pie" edition).
I M M U N E
Both M r . Mooney and
Dr. Levy (respectively
College Catering Manager
and Chairman of the R e -
fectory Committee) regard-
ed the infestation as small
in comparison with other
areas of Kensington. M i c e
were hard to get rid of,
they said, as one cannot
use mouse poisons near
food; cockroaches o n the
other hand are fairly easy
to get rid of, providing
one changes the poisons
regularly as they become
immune after a while.
L O W I N F E S T A T I O N
M r . Erskine, Public
Relations Officer for the
R o y a l Borough of Ken-
sington and Chelsea, said
that the mouse problem
in South K e n . was no dif-
ferent from any other part
of the borough but that
certain districts had a
higher infestation. These
were Redcliffe, Brompton
R o a d and Earl's Court.
The Gloucester R o a d to
Exhibition R o a d area was
below the average for
South Ken. The main rea-
sons for the increase in the
rodent population, he con-
tinued, were the drop i n
popularity of cats as pets,
the proliferation of bed-
sits with individual kit-
chens and the increase of
resistance to poisons.
L E F T T O G O
A spokesman from the
Institute o f Cleaning
Science who is also a mem-
ber of the Hotel, Catering
and Institutional Manage-
ment Association (the
self-explanatory profes-
sional bodies for the cater-
ing trade) said that it was
inexcusable for a catering
establishment i n this d a y
and age to have any pest
infestation whatsoever,
and particularly so i n
young buildings like I C .
Provided the kitchen and
refectory areas had regu-
lar routine cleaning, occa-
sional checks by the local
Health Officer and that
the Pest Infestation Officer
is called in at the first sign
of cockroaches or mice
(recommended catering
practice) then there would
not be any problem at a l l
at IC. F o r a s u m as large
as £3,350 to need to S e
spent o n disinfecting Hie
refectories, i n c 1 u d i n g
steam cleaning and wall
washing, means that the
kitchens were obviously
just left to go.
P O S I T I V E D A N G E R
M r . Mooney as College
Catering Manager is the
one responsible for the
hygiene of the kitchens
and refectories and so
ought to have ensured
that the problem never
reached the proportions of
today. N o t only are cock-
roaches generally unwel-
come in Yorkshire P u d ,
but i n the words of the
spokesman from the I C S :
" A n y pest infestation i n
an area where food is be-
ing prepared or consumed
positively endangers the
health of the staff and cus-
tomers".
