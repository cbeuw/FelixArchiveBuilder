Post-Grads
unite for action
Tomorrow, Wednesday, 14th of March, is the Day
of Action in support of the Grants Campaign. Inclu-
ded in the Programme of Events will be a discussion
on Post Graduates Affairs in Mech. Eng. 220 from 11
a.m. onwards* The discussion will be on a broader level
than just grants, though this will constitute an hnpor-
tant part. Other topics of interest to P.G.'s are demon-
strating fees, insurance whilst working, the standard

of catering facilities and
bureaucracy.
The basis for the discus-
cussion will be the replies
to the recent question-
naire sent to all post grad-
uates of whom over 240
replied. It showed their
P.G.'s are interested, are
concerned and are willing
to do something. Having
the information is very im-
portant. In a recent N U S
publication, "Post gradu-
ate Studentship: A n inter-
im Review" is stated. " W e
seriously doubt the validi-
ty of D.E.S.'s estimate that
postgraduate (demonstrat-
ing) earnings averaged as
much as £160 in 1969 . ."
other problems of College
Last week's Presidential elections were a
complete wash-out. Only 540 students voted, a
shortfall of nearly 500 on the number required
to make the vote "quorate". It was the third
such election held this year, and few expected
it to be any more successful than its predeces-
sors.
The candidates, Simon Allnutt and John Herrick
for President and R o b Armitage and Francis Matthews
for Secretary,, were standing for posts for the next
academic year, 1973-4.
Both posts carry a sab-
batical year. Nominations
opened yesterday for the
re-election. Forms will re-
main up until the last day
of term o n Friday week,
and the elections will be
held a week after the start
of next term, o n M a y 8th
and 9th.
A n election was held in
October for President for
the current year, following
the failure of Chris Shep-
pard, President-elect, to
take his examinations last
summer. The candidates
were R o b Armitage and
Adrian Smith. Although a
quorum of votes were cast,
the candidates only got
about a hundred each —
there were a record 833
abstentions, mainly caused
by a propaganda leaflet
put out by the constituent
college executives.
The re-election, held i n
November, brought with it
five candidates — John
Lane was eventually elect-
ed, but only by a vote that
fell short of the quorum by
about 40.
In view of the number
of elections held this year,
and the lack of publicity
for the last ones, it seems
hardly surprising that there
is such a lack of interest
in them.
NUPE threatens to close college
M''PL is the union of non-technical and non-admin-
istrative workers at IC, its membership is 90% of the
night security guards, messengers, catering and refec-
tory staff, cleaners and certain sections of the mainten-
ance personnel. They have given the college notice that
they are considering holding on the spot 24 hour strikes
in the near future.

This in a very vague
statement. F r o m the basis
of the reply, we can now
say that at I.C.. the aver-
age postgraduate who
was lucky enough to get
any demonstAiting at a l l .
and it seems that only 44
per cent have managed to
do it since their arrival
here, had average earnings
considerably less than
£100, and only very few
have earned more than
£160, the D.E.S.'s aver-
age figure.
52 per cent of respond-
ents receive the basic re-
search council grant of
£650, and a further 10 per
cent receive less. There-
fore, bearing in mind that
only 44 per cent can sup-
plement their income by
demonstrating etc., there
are many postgraduates
who are worse off than
their fellow undergradu-
ates. U.G.'s in London
should receive £15 per
week, assuming a 30 week
year with £1 per week in
vacations, compared to a
postgraduate £12.30 per
week for a 52 week year.
This comparison is admit-
tedly unfair to U.G.'s, as
many don't receive a l l
they should, and many
can't live for £1 per week
in vacations (who can!),
but the fact remains that
the Government thinks
that that is how the situa-
tion is.
The main reason that
U.G.'s are apparenty bet-
ter off is the existence of
a London Allowance for
them. A l l P . G . respond-
ents who took their first
degrees outside London
are agreed that student
costs i n London are signi-
ficantly higher than out-
side. There is a good case
for a London Allowance
for P.G.'s in addition to a
nationwide review of P . G .
awards.
The Ashby Report in
1960 recommended that a
studentship should be suf-
ficiently high to allow " a
standard of living rather
higher than that enjoyed
by most undergraduates
of comparable ability."
This appears to be the
case in Canada and Aus-
tralia, and to quote from
one questionnaire: "living
in L o n d o n is much more
expensive than living in
Brisbane, Australia, yet
Australia P.G.'s on Aust-
ralian Government schol-
arships receive about the
equivalent of £1400 p.a.
before demonstrating or
tutoring payments. In
other words, they can d o
more than just exist
whilst undertaking P.G.
studies."
