On Monday last week Adams told students on rent strike that
unless they paid their h a l l fees by t h e end of the week they
would be evicted. T h e r e have been rumours that overseas
students would be sent down if they failed to pay up.

Once again Walter A d a m s
has broken rank w i t h the
other vice chancellors when
he (and the Dundee V C )
entered into direct conflict
with students supporting the
NUS grants campaign. The
expected conflict w i t h the
police did not occur d u r i n g
last week's sit in. Walter, it
seemed, was quite happy for
the students to occupy St.
Clement's as long as they did
not interfere with the run-
ning of the School. H e did
get annoyed at the pickets
however. He told the three
'leaders' of the sit in that he
would have them arrested un-
less they called them off.
This brilliant tactical move
b y Mr. A d a m s was ably
thwarted by the leaders. They
politely asked the pickets to
move on. who politely re-
fused! T h e three had ab-
solved themselves of legal
responsibility!
S C U F F L E S
A s well as occupying the
St. Clements b u i l d i n g t h e y
also picketed classes and the
library on Thursday and F r i -
day. A b o u t 150 students slept
in on Thursday night includ-
ing Jeff S i a n n i t o r t h , N U S
Treasurer. There were a few
scuffles on Thursday even-
ing on the picket line but
generally it has been quiec—
it was so quiet and so lack-
ing i n violent student clashes
that the media revel in that
the M i r r o r was forced to de-
scribe it as the "most boring
strike in Britain today". On
Friday m o r n i n g about 50
pickets stood at the various
entrances. Everyone that
went i n was asked to sign a
declaration of solidarity w i t h
the pickets' action, but the
response was poor w . t h
A d a m s looking on.
A L L I A N C E
The decision to boycott
was taken on Tuesday and in
spite of opposition from some
U n i o n Exec, members, mili-
tancy was the order of the
day, however suggestions for
ripping up paving slabs and
stoning Parliament, and simi-
lar violent action were rejec-
ted as infantile disorder. The
three m a i n points of the
campaign were agreed as
firstly "to protect the rent
strikers. against victimisa-
t i o n " ; secondly "to support
the national campaign for
higtier grants" and thirdly
"to support the worker-stu-
dent alliance against a com-
mon enemy". In this latter
aim they hoped to get sup-
port from Briant's colour
printers whom they had
supported when they were
picketing. The college porters
were helpful at night but i n
the m o r n i n g a few went
round and cut chains barring
doors.
S U P P O R T
A t the union meeting on
Friday afternoon it was de-
cided to discontinue the occu-
pation. Carl Saunders hall
and two blocks of student
flats decided to stay out on
strike and full support from
the U n i o n was voted to them,
including the promise to pay
all legal fees, and possible
lines. So the situation is that
with only one week of term-
time left at L S E , it is pos-
sible that those on rent
strike will find themselves
locked out of their halls
when they arrive back i n
London next term. There are
several ways that the situa-
tion could be avoided. A sit
in next week to effectively
put the college out of ac-
tion; or a sit in through the
holidays in the halls affected;
or by Blacking (no relation)
the halls; i.e. no student
wou'd reoccupy the vacated
rooms next term. Next week
could see the head-on clash
at L S E (again)!
ALWAYS READ THE SMALL PRINT
PRESIDENT'S PIECE
ALL OUT QN MARCH 14th
Friday's extraordinary general meeting was a
good start in the right for 100 per cent support
tor the National Student Strike tomorrow. The
meeting was one or the best advertised this term,
it was well quorate and passed the strike motion
by a solid majority. It was really hilarious to see
the expressions on the races of the poor saps who
came along for the sole purpose of challenging
tne quorum, when the E.G.M. turned out to be
very well attended indeed. We have rather too
many wet sponges and prophets of doom in I.C.
telling us how apathetic we all are. It's real good
to see them put in their place once in a while.
Nobody ican now complain that the decision to
support the N.U.S. strike was undemocratic. It
has been debated at two union meetings, the issue
has been discussed throughout the college over the
last fortnight, and everyone had the chance to
come along on Friday to speak and vote. Once
a decision is taken in a quorate union meeting it
should be implemented by every member, how-
ever the good thing about Friday's meeting was
that we voted in favour in the knowledge that
everyone there would have to work to make the
strike a success. Ordinary students will have to
be convinced by personal discussions to support
the strike and that's where YOU come in. You can
do three things:—
(1) Discuss with the others in your class why
they should strike on Wednesday and join in the
Activity;
(2) Organise a petition round your class asking
lecturers to support you by postponing the lecture
(petitions available from the union office).
(3) Turn up early tomorrow morning to man the
entrance to your department to persuade other
students to attend the alternative activities (teach-
in on education etc.) instead of their usual lec-
tures.
If even a small faction of the readership of
Felix do the three things mentioned above the
strike will be a success.
WHY STRIKE?
As the campaign has developed the reasons
people have given for not supporting militant action
have been disproved in no uncertain fashion. The
idea that militancy alienates the public has been
shattered. This campaign has had- a lot of good
publicity (and virtually no bad publicity) centring
around the rent strikes and demonstrations. Also
the idea that what is needed is reasoned discus-
sion between N.U.S. and the D.E.S. has been
proved absurd. It was a hard fight to get that dis-
cussion and when it came the Government con Id
not argue against our case but argued solely that
the state of the economy could not support a
grants increase. Unfortunately for them, this argu-
ment looks a bit thin when we remember that the
surtax reforms in the budget gave for instance
Edward Heath a £6.20 per week bonus and that
education and housing expenditure is being cut
back to allow for expansion in defence expendi-
ture.
The Government is doing little to hold down
prices and many of its measures are pushing them
up—floating the pound, V.A.T. AH we are asking is
for the right to maintain the standards that stu-
dents had in the immediate past and to ensure
that no student is discriminated against because
of their parents' meanness or the type of course
they are doing.
In fighting for higher grants we are not being
selfish—some of us will not even benefit directly.
We are representing the interests of future students
and trying to safeguard the right of people to enter
higher education regardless of their parents'
wealth. For if the value of the maintenance grant
continues to decline education will become a
privilege for those whose parents are able (and
willing) to subsidise their children.
To those who are not swayed by any of the
above arguments can I say this? What is your
alternative? The March 14th strike can be a very
impressive demonstration of support for the claim.
It will also give the Government some considerable
food for thought. If N.U.S. can bring higher educa-
tion to a standstill for one day, wiil there ever be
peace in the Colleges until the claim is met?
Are we just going to allow the Government to
"think about our claim'-' till doomsday? If so, we
might as well send a nice letter to St. John-Stevas
saying "O.K., Norman, we weren't really serious
about the grants increase—sorry about all the
demos and shouting, etc., etc." Well we could just
lie down, curl up and die, but I think the E.G.M.
showed what the majority think — continue the
fight — stop the delays on the grants claim — all
out on March 1 4th.
Note. Overseas students may be worried that
joining the strike could lead to deportation or
withdrawn scholarships. It is the N.U.S.'s belief
that an overseas student sponsored by the British
Government will not suffer as a result of the day's
activity. It is just possible but extremely unlikely
that a "politically sensitive" overseas student spon-
sored by his home government may have prob-
lems. I would urge all overseas students to sup-
port the Day of Action, even if it does not affect
their own grants, to help their fellow students.
If, however, they are frightened of reprisals, the
union will of course, make every allowance for
this.
But the best solution is to make sure that there
aren't any classes to go to anyway!
PAPERBACKS
' J u n g ' by Anthony Storr,
M o d e r n M a s t e r s . 4 0 p .
Fontana
It is a frequent c r i t i c i s m of ex-
planatory books on great m e n a n d
their work that the original w a s more
comprehensible than the Bowdler
ised version a n d , that people's a w e of
a legendary name exaggerates the
imagined difficulty of reading h i m .
W i t h this in m i n d one tends to ap-
proach any item in the 'Fontana M o d -
ern M a s t e r s ' series with a certain
suspicion. However, Anthony Storr's
book on J u n g is a w e l c o m e exception.
J u n g , psychologist c u m philosopher,
is a name to conjure with. In spite of
his widespread reputation very few
do so o w i n g to unequally widespread
ignorance of the content of his
writing. If Freud has suffered by mis-
representation then J u n g has been
excluded from the c o m m o n under
standing by having no representation
at a l l . F e w names c a n be s o w i d e l y
known a n d so little understood.
To a d d to this promising start
J u n g ' s work is excessively obscure.
His remarkable inability to c o m m u n i -
cate a n d the weight of his writings
d e m a n d the sort of exposition that
the Fontana series are designed to
provide.
M r . Storr does well in compressing
into 1 2 0 pages an appreciation of
Jung's ideas. He concentrates on the
banes of J u n g ' s thought rather than
emphasising the historical, narrative
aspect, w h i c h renders the book both
more readable a n d more useful. H e
succeeds in setting out the major
developments first attributable to
J u n g , as well as Jung's understand-
ing of them, a n d relating these to cur-
rent trains of thought. The result is
that one feels it w o u l d be difficult
and unwise to argue over this border-
line area of man's personality related
to his health a n d beliefs, in disregard
to the foundations of modern under-
standing.
