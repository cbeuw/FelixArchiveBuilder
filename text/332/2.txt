Sir, i
The arguments last week
in support of the existence of
this: figure called Christ
amounted to sheer nonsense;
thus to go on and compare
Christ with a revolutionary
is to stand all logic on its
head.
A revolutionary or groups
of revolutionaries are groups
of people who strive to-
wards the overthrow of the
old order and by implication
the construction of a new
social structure. Christ from
whatever stand-point never
stood to challenge the slav-
ery system that existed with-
in the Roman Empire in any
meaningful way. On the
contrary, he took on precise-
ly the opposite role; that of
advocating an ideology
which could offer no guide
on earth to the emancipation
of any oppressed people but
actually offered the opposite,
thai of accepting whatever
fate or conditions on this
earth which confronted the
masses. "The almighty, all
powerful wonderful loving
God looks on, he under-
stands". So the message is
no need to struggle now
(accept your conditions now
no matter how bad they are)
for God understands and any-
may it's worth a life of mis-
ery just to know that you
are going to have eternal
bliss after death. The devel-
opment of all religions con-
tain this same train of
thought of how to avoid the
material world and replace it
by the mystical (the empha-
sis on one's-self, the ego-
centric nature occurring
from the whole philosophy
that I must be here for some
purpose mustn't I; the whole
world is then analysed in
terms of how it fits in with
one's-self and not the con-
trary).
Does the Christian philos-
ophy itself foster any harm-
ful ideology (i.e. ideas which
are opposed to the interests
of the masses)? In fact it
represents one of the biggest
schools of thought opposing
revolutionaries; not only in
its escapist philosophies but
through its institutions which
reflect the Christian ideology
within the present system.
It was no accident that
Muisolini and Franco both
had open backing including
a big flow of gold from the
Vatican's coffers to support
the rise of Fascism in
Europe. Greek Orthodox
Church supported the Greek
coup, the Anglican Church
preaches racial segregation
.within South Africa and act-
ively supports the regime.
Hitler like us in Britain had
God on his side during the
last war. Always great bas-
tions of religion (the Church)
come down on the side of
the old reactionary social
structure and oppose the new
social structure.
Accepting God is super-
natural, the all-mighty power-
ful creature he is supposed
to be, whey then does he
condemn two-thirds of the
world to a permanent level
of starvation and malnutri-
tion; to allow massive wars,
the dropping of atom bombs,
suffering and misery. There
can only be one conclusion
—this God must be a vicious,
cruel God who coldly sub-
jects millions of new born
babies generation after gen-
eration to this world of
misery without doing any-
thing about it. (It is more
probable that this God has
no super-natural powers and
so is powerless to intervene
in the changing events within
the world; so is it worth
praying to an impotent
God?)
Within this country the
trade-union movement has
won virtually every right
working people have today
which we all take for grant-
ed, the church on the other
hand has spent its last 100
years campaigning against
the trade union movement.
Today, working people, stu-
dents, whole layers of people
are thrown into struggle to
defend their rights; what
philosophy should they take
up? Mystical or material.
(Prayer or struggle?).
Even in Imperial College
it is noticeable that God Soc
is not represented on the
grants action committee
(which is open to anyone);
is it that they are opposed
to students getting higher
grants or are they too busy
praying to the government to
concede NUS's demands?
JOCK ME ALL.

-who takes
thd blame?
Sir,—This is a letter de-
ploring the attitude taken by
certain individuals to try to
disrupt the union meeting, or
censorship of individuals, or
calling quorum (when, at the
instant it was called, the
meeting was definitely quor-
ate). A large part of the
blame must fall on Mr.
Black, Mr. Jowitt and Mr.
Lane.
The ultimate authority for
the conduct of IC student
affairs rests with the student
union meetings. The prime
task for the executive must
be to ensure the smooth
running of these meetings, to
try to minimise disruptions
and maximise discussions. If
Exec disagree with motions
they should stand up and
argue against them as
opposed to using the rule
book to positively discourage
discussion. Even Mr. Lane
allows this procedure to
occur without a murmur of
criticism. The Chairman's
failure, time and time again,
throughout this year, has
been to point out to the
meetingthe purpose of hav-
ing a rule book is to increase
the smooth running of the
meeting and not to do the
opposite. As a consequence
of the weak chairing, very
bad publicity and the failure
to encourage debate, this
has allowed a continual de-
generation of meetings since
Mr. McCullough's era last
year.
We the undersigned hope
the executive will in future
make much more effort to
encourage debate at Union
meetings.

From our
observant
reader
Sir,
Being an observant mem-
ber of IC Union I have
observed the following in-
teresting occurrence. In the
article on SCAB last week
the following phrases were
noticed. (1) "misconcep-
tions", (2) "for the benefit
of the students of Imperial
College", (3) "Ents this
year has been an outstand-
ing financial success and
assuming they continue in
this vein in coming years
then it was felt that their ex-
cess should be used to bene-
fit the entertainment of
smaller minority groups with-
in the college", (4) "swallow
up Film Soc or any other
club", (5) Co-operation is
the name of the game, not
Monopoly". When I com-
pared these and other
phrases with those in an
article in the RCS Broad-
sheet I discovered that a
large amount of the material
in the two articles was dup-
licated. There was, however,
one major difference. In the
Broadsheet article, the name
at the bottom was that of
D. Dawson. The name at the
bottom of the Felix article
was M. J. Simmons. This in
itself is not particularly eye-
brow raising until you realise
that Mr. Simmons is stand-
ing for the new post of Social
Secretary instigated by this
board. Just who is it that will
actually be in charge of the
committee if Mr. Simmons
gets elected? Mr. Simmons
or Mr. Dawson?
Yours observantly,
K.H.

Jottings
Sir,—/ wish to make cer-
tain comments on the run-
ning of IC Union Meetings.
It is each member's demo-
cratic right to challenge the
quorum at any point in the
meeting and it is absolutely
correct that motions re-
quiring a large amount of
support for them to be put
into effect such as the mo-
tion at the UGM on Thurs-
day, 1st March proposing a
lecture boycott on March
14th should not be passed
at an inquorate Meeting. But
it is becoming obvious that
certain elements in the union
are using the quorum call
simply as a means of oppos-
ing a motion and ignoring
the proper means of doing
so—that of making a speech
against the motion and let-
ting people hear the reasons
for opposing. There were no
speeches against the motion
mentioned (an amendment is
not a speech against).
On this point, the lack of
knowledge of the constitu-
tion displayed by the chair-
man of the meeting (Paul
Jowitt) is to be deplored.
According to Standing Order
12, if there are no speeches
against a motion the chair-
man must "formally ask if
there is any opposition of
discussion, and warn the
meeting that if there is no
opposition or discussion he
will declare the motion . . .
carried and shall, in the
event of there being still no
opposition or discussion, de-
clare the motion . . . car-
ried." This he did not do;
instead he moved to a vote.
Finally I wish to deplore
the undemocratic behaviour
of certain other members of
the union who, after the
quorum had been success-
fully challenged, tried by
various means to get the
motion carried anyway. The
correct way to go about this
is to call an EGM on anoth-
er day and make sure that
it is quorate. It is pointless
to go ahead with such action
as a lecture boycott without
the mandate of a union meet-
ing—and the proposer of the
motion himself stated that
he did not want a vote if
the meeting was inquorate.
Surely if we are to get a
greater amount of interest
and involvement in the union
which is essential if the
union is to defend and ad-
vance the interests of its
members, we must have de-
cisions taken democratically
by the members.
Yours sincerely,
SONIA HOCHFELDER.
E D ' S N O T E : This letter
should have been published
last week. Its unfortunate
omission was owing to cir-
cumstances beyond our c o n -
trol.
State of
the Union
Dear Oily, — Knowing my
restrained nature as you do,
you will realise how dis-
turbed I must be, to express
my views in your hallowed
columns. It will be clear to
anyone who heard about
Friday's fiasco in the Great
Hall, that the time has come
for a reappraisal of the
Union's role in Imperial Col-
lege, particularly with refer-
ence to its policy making; a
look at the State of the
Union, in fact.
In my long experience of
being closely involved with
the Union's affairs, there has
always been general agree-
ment on internal policy;
everyone wants diversifica-
tion, more representation and
better food.
The violent clashes that
have been occurring recently
have been almost entirely
over external policy; over
Grants, Autonomy, NUS,
Trades Unions; the list is as
long as Penney's limousine.
Granted, there are very
sharp divisions over all these
issues, but as a democratic-
ally-organised body we
should be able to make de-
cisions on the issues and
take action according to
these decisions. Is it, then,
that we are not a democracy?
Universally agreed criteria
for a working democracy are
that all citizens should be
adequately informed and that
there should be universal
suffrage. We all have the
vote; and as strongly as we
may criticise Oily, Felix, and
I believe Broadsheet and the
(unmentionable) Guilds and
Mines rags generally man-
age to mention the issues;
and let's not forget Cefe. So
where is the missing link?
It revolves around one
word, participation. Without
universal participation there
can be no democracy. What,
then, can encourage this in-
volvement?
On reflection, one answer
is discussion on more rele-
vant issues; but what is more
relevant than Grants, Auton-
omy, and Education? The
only other answer is more
credible leadership. Without
doubt this is where we are
failing, and it is inexcusable
that people do not take the
elections of sabbatical offi-
cers seriously.
The primary leadership of
the Union should be the
Executive; but how can one
follow the lead of Messrs.
Lane, Jowitt and Black, when
they cannot even be respon-
sible enough to maintain
their credibility and to stop
scratching each others' eyes
out in public? Mr. Lane, sin-
cere, but embattled, tries to
do the "right" thing, but is
caught in the impossible posi-
tion of trying to satisfy both
the Union and the Commun-
ist Party. Mr. Black, the sup-
remely efficient bureaucrat,
tries to stay out of politics,
having burnt his fingers a
few times. Mr. Jowitt is an
admitted super-reactionary,
posing as the champion of
individual liberty, but only
managing to stifle it by his
total irresponsibility.
The CCU Presidents, also
on the Exec, seem to have
abdicated (in disgust?) their
responsibility to ICU. Where
is the leadership in that?
The UGM is the policy-
making body of the Union;
what a farce! The centrists
and conservatives complain
that the Union is having left-
ist policy foisted on it by the
small group of people who
MANIFESTOS
for the new post of
SOCIAL SECRETARY
to be elected at Thursday's UGM
Having read my article on
how S C A B is going to work
in last week's Felix, you will
not be surprised to learn that
I am standing for Social S e c -
retary. I have been involved
in the formation of S C A B
from the beginning and
know, as I said last week,
what has to be done and how
to do it. If elected I will give
any help which it is within
my power to give to any of
the societies on the Board.
I will be ready to advise and
give assistance to them and
to anyone who wishes to
start a new c l u b which
would require financial assist-
ance from S C A B . For ex-
ample, if anyone wanted to
re-start the now defunct
Blues Club.
I believe the function o f
S C A B will be to provide e n -
tertainment, and not merely
popular entertainment, for
the students of Imperial C o l -
lege. This can only be ach-
ieved if money spinners like
Ents., who have now d e c i d e d
to function m o r e or less as
they have done this year, c a n
have their profits directed
towards the benefit of s m a l -
ler clubs like Folk Club.
These clubs are not purely
for entertainment but are i n -
tended to promote interest
and participation. Entertain-
ment in Imperial College
will not be improved until all
those concerned co-operate
in fields such as publicity (it
is hoped to make more use
of W e l l s o c ' s silk screen
machine).
All these things will be
attended to if I am elected.
In the five years I have
been at IC I have noted a
distinct lack of c o m m u n i c a -
tion between the organisers
of entertainment and those
who are entertained. If elect-
ed, I will attempt to find a
solution to this state of
affairs.
In these two years, I have
played an active part in the
running of IC Folk Club (for
most of this session as Presi-
dent) and also o n R C S E n -
tertainments Committee. I
have therefore considerable
experience in the running of
and the needs of smaller
clubs and also in the organ-
isation of larger events. A l -
though, as Social Secretary,
I w o u l d not be directly
involved in the running of
specific events (that is up to
the committees of the sep-
arate organisations) I have
the experience to appreciate
the needs and problems of
the organisations on the
Board.
T h e election will be by
popular ballot at the Union
meeting on Thursday. Please
bother to compose motions:
Corbyn, Smith, Hochfelder,
Lane, Armitage. Why is it,
then, that the centre and the
right cannot present its own
motions, rather than waiting
to destroy the leftist policy,
or amending it until it effec-
tively says nothing? Messrs.
Sinclair and Jowitt are bril-
liant at composing amend-
ments; have they no policy to
present?
If people can turn out to
block the Rent Strike, why
can't they turn out to vote
for what they think is reas-
onable? Or is it the feeling
generally that we should do
nothing on Grants, Autonomy
and White Paper?
I'd like to see the Union
being positive; we can't all
be socialist, but we can be
activist, and participate in
the running of the Union.
Centrists and the Right
should not react to leftist
policy by destroying it, but
by presenting alternative
policy; there must be a
dialogue in the Union rather
than messy, juvenile squab-
bling.
The solution to our prob-
lem is participation, not red-
bashing; if we're dissatisfied
with our official leadership
let's censure it, or even re-
place it; but for Christ's sake
let's all sit down and talk
rationally and positively.
Yours etc.,
M. T. PHILLIPS
c o m e and vote. It is vital that
S C A B gets the right kind of
leadership if it is to function
as it is intended to function
and I believe that I can pro-
vide that, kind of leadership.
A l s o , I believe, as I feel sure
you will, that we must pre-
vent a great Ents takeover.
Please c o m e along and
vote, and better still, vote
for me, Mike S i m m o n s , for
a more unified and compre-
hensive system of entertain-
ment and recreation at IC.
M I K E S I M M O N S .
I w o u l d like to introduce
you to J i m Mitchell. J i m has
emerged from Aero 2 to
stand for the newly created
post of social secretary. For
the past year he has been
actively involved in the run-
ning of both I.C. ents a n d C
and G ents. This means he
has helped organise both
large scale events, e.g. C a n d
G carnival, I.C. ents concerts,
and smaller events, e.g. C
and G revue. T h e first of
these meant close liaison
with dram s o c a n d film s o c
who are both members of
S C A B . He is very well
known around college and
has always involved himself
in discussions on any as-
pects of entertainments.
Therefore, please support
J i m in the elections on
Thursday.
P. A. WADSWORTH
Hello! W e l l you've heard
who I a m and where I c o m e
from, I'd now like to say
why I think I'd make a g o o d
Social Secretary next year.
This job of social s e c is a
job c o m m o n in other colleges
and is ideally just a question
of co-ordinating the events
put on by Film s o c , Folk
Club, Ents, etc., and doing
this without treading o n
anybody's toes. S C A B must
be run to give entertainment
for all minority and majority
groups within college and
only secondary allowance
must be made for outsiders.
T h i s could mean supervising
the birth or resurrection of
other entertainment clubs
such as Blues s o c . Firstly,
though, we must find out
what Y O U want and to this
end an Arts festival could be
run next term.
S C A B will make it easier
for bookings a n d publicity,
IC Ents has the connections
to make booking of bands
and artistes of all kinds eas-
ier, hence easing the load o n
other parts of S C A B .
Rag W e e k events. Folk
carnival etc. could be m a d e
more viable by S C A B , i n -
stead of the current situa-
tion in w h i c h C C U ' s run
these events in a s e m i -
amateur manner.
Financially, matters c a n
be m a d e more secure by
pooling resources, hence
any clubs catering for total
minority interests will not be
considered " p o o r c o u s i n s "
of Ents, Filmsoc, etc.
A s S C A B will be the sole
representative on council
for events, this will give a
fair hearing to all instead of
just Ents as is now the case.
It must be understood that
S C A B is not an Ents takeover
of the rest. Rather it is a
pooling and co-ordination of
resources and experience
that events will be more v i -
able and desirable, especi-
ally where large scale events
are concerned.
So oome along to the
U n i o n meeting next T h u r s d a y
and vote for the students
candidate and make your c o l -
lege m o r e enjoyable next
year.
