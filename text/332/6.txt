it's your money they're after
. . . but who and
what are they ?
No matter what the crisis, what the state of the
nation, no matter how long and over what issues
the government grapples with the trade unions, no
matter how many times a week the world wobbles
on the brink of monetary crises—no matter what, it
seems, there never seems to be any shortage of
people reaching out for your money.
J u s t take a look at the financial c o l u m n s of any
newspaper. It w i l l be c r a m m e d w i t h advertising
f r o m a l l sorts a n d c o n d i t i o n s of institutions v y i n g
with each other to grab your money a n d use it, as
they say, to your advantage.
S c h e m e s , plans, policies, blueprints, programmes,
projects, strategems a n d s y s t e m s pour out of the
pages in an avalanche of print. Every one stuffed
w i t h reasons w h y y o u ought to part w i t h your c a s h
and a l l o w some body of faceless men work a kind
of m a g i c a n d make it multiply for you.
They come under a variety of headings. Unit
Trusts, Property B o n d s , Guaranteed Growth B o n d s ,
Single P r e m i u m A n n u i t i e s or mere advice on i n -
vestment. A n y t h i n g this side of the l a w w h i c h might
earn a buck for the operator.
W e l l , of course, w e a l l k n o w that very f e w read-
ers of Felix Financially have enough spare loot to
be over-worried about the m a c h i n a t i o n s of these
things right n o w , but w e thought it w o u l d be inter-
esting to explain what s o m e of them are a n d what
they d o . After a l l , w e ' l l all be in the chips one day,
and forewarned is forearmed.
Probably the best known of these ideas are those
known as Unit Trusts. A unit trust is simply a pool
of money contributed in small or large amounts
by numbers of individuals and which is then in-
vested by the trust managers in stocks and shares.
The value of any one person's investment is the
value of the shares the trust has bought for them.
As the market goes up and down, so does the value
of the investment you make.
The operators of such s c h e m e s as these make
their profit by m a k i n g an initial c h a r g e — u s u a l l y
between 3 a n d 5 per cent of every pound invested
— a n d a management fee, usually levied half-yearly,
on the income from the investments. T h i s normally
c o m e s to between one-fifth a n d one-half per cent.
S o m e unit trusts specialise in different types of
investment. F o r example, s o m e go for North A m e r i -
can shares, s o m e for m i n i n g shares, others go for
retail shop shares, a n d so o n .
A n d the a i m s of different unit trusts are different.
Some a i m to produce i n c o m e for the investor; others
go for straight capital g a i n . B u t the majority spread
their investment fairly w i d e l y and this is the case
w i t h most of the 2 8 0 or so unit trusts n o w operating
in this country.
One incentive here, of course, is that the oper-
ator has the same interest in the profitable w o r k i n g
of the trust as the investor, since the bigger the
trust fund is, the bigger the profit for its managers.
In return, the investor is s u p p o s e d to get skilled,
professional management, w h i c h ought to make
his money grow.
But if the aims and methods of unit trusts vary,
so does the performance. On past results, it appears
they will take about 16 years to double your invest-
ment, and that's not a lot of good in these inflation-
ary times.
Naturally, a lot depends o n w h e n y o u buy into
the trust a n d when you sell out. You p a y for expert
advice, but even with the best of the unit trusts,
everything hinges on h o w well y o u time your buying
and selling of your investment w i t h them.
Another type of unit trust is the property b o n d .
These are often organised by insurance companies,
w h i c h put your money into property rather than in
shares. N o w , this c o l u m n has always a d v i s e d in
favour of putting money into property, a n d many
of these property trusts d o represent a reasonable
hedge against inflation.
The trouble is they have proved so popular in
the past year that many property bond operators
have bought every type of property in a kind of
blind panic. T h e properties are valued each month
by independent valuers a n d they always report i n -
creased values. T h e snag is that w h e n the fund
goes to sell, it might w e l l find that properties do
not fetch quite the same as their value on paper.
Nevertheless, it has to be said that this is one
way of getting into property—and a continually ris-
ing market—without committing yourself to one
building.
Investment Trusts are not to be confused w i t h Unit
Trusts. Investment Trusts are merely private trad-
ing c o m p a n i e s w h o specialise in the buying a n d
selling of other c o m p a n i e s ' shares. They tend to be
more internationally-minded than other investment
programmes, a n d have a fairly successful record.
A s with unit trusts, there are tax advantages for the
investor. T h e real trick here is to pick the right one,
since there are over 2 0 0 of these to choose from.
Equity B o n d s are similar to property bonds,
except the investment is done in equities. Here
again, the results w i l l depend on w h e n y o u get in
and w h e n y o u get o u t — a n d whether the manage-
ment are the fat cats of the financial w o r l d or the
bright young m e n .
Guaranteed G r o w t h B o n d s are issued by insur-
ance companies, as a rule, a n d they are merely
single p r e m i u m investments with a guaranteed re-
turn over a period of years. H o w g o o d they are
depends on the overall financial situation at the time
of investment. They are sometimes very attractive,
but the gamble always is whether the rate y o u are
offered today is going to be realistic in five years'
time, w h e n your money is still tied u p .
So, they are just some of the ideas money m e n
have had to make a profit. There are many ways to
do it, of course, a n d w h e n it c o m e s to m a k i n g a
shilling, the gnomes are w i s e to them a l l .
But always remember it's your money they're
after. Before ever you fall for the blandishments in
the ads, or get conned into thinking you have only
to sit back and wa?t for your money to grow, have
a good look at the investment scheme that attracts
you and make sure it's right.
C h e c k its performance, its reputation a n d its via-
bility. Take independent, expert advice if y o u c a n .
And don't take anything entirely on trust—even
if it is a unit trust.

W H E N V O T I N G , so don't forget to bring your green
72-73 cards with you next Monday. O n Wednesday,
M a r c h 21st a F R E E results edition of Broadsheet will
be out, this follows the Results U n i o n meeting on
Tuesday, M a r c h 20th. So for the U n i o n that you want
to see next year, V O T E on M o n d a y ! ! !
The coverage of this year's R.C.S.U. elections is
the fifth such one undertaken by Broadsheet in its five
year existence. I n V o l u m e 1 Number 8 ( M a r c h 13th,
1969) we reported on the election of John Butterworth
(President), Barry Pywell (V-P) and M i s s Penny W a l -
ters as H o n . Sec. T h e following year a poll of 331
was reached, this being constitutionally too small the
election was reheld the following term. (See we beat
I.C.U. by all of 3 years!). T h e " w i n n e r " of this presi-
dential election, M r . P. Sharkey, came only third i n the
second election, which was w o n by Steve Cooke, with
Nick Wilkinson beating Tony Johnson as V - P . H o w -
ever this second poll (of 385) was again too small (by
about 115 votes) but not to worry folks, a n inquorate
results U . G . M . accepted the election (things never
change, do they?). T h e following year (in one of the
first Roneo'd Broadsheets) the poll was better (442)
and Bill Gerrard beat Pete Gannen (231 to 156) to
become President '71-2 and M . C. Black (I've heard of
him) became H o n . Sec. by beating N . Wilkinson. T h e
following year's election results edition of Broadsheet
(Vol. 4 N o . 7j—brilliantly done by a newly appointed
editor) told the story of last year's 507 vote poll, with
Rosemary Parker winning the presidential election
(against John Higgs), Caroline Bingham beating B i l l
Collett (and how! 368 to 90), John Smith got elected
as A A O in preference to John Gibbons and there were
3 candidates for the post of H o n . Junior Treasurer,
Brian Smith beating Miss Mary Short and Ian O r a m .
John Nuttall was unopposed as Hon. Sec. (oh so that's
how he got it — Enlightened R.C.S.U. member).
W e there'll be the usual amount of bumph from the
candidates about again this year and if someone had
saved all of last year's election bumph they could
write an interesting article on how the candidates for
I.C.U. and R.C.S.U. posts lived u p to their promises.
N o w it just so happens that last year I d i d save a l l
the election bumph . . .
