SO WHAT happened at the National
Grants Demonstration last Friday? A
piddling 1
% turn-out?
So maybe the other 99% of the
students at Imperial College do not
care about the rough deal married women
get on grants; maybe they are thumbing
their noses at the poor blighters at non-
university institutions who grants are
awarded at the whim of an educational
authority; maybe they are smug at the
thought of their parents eroding their
nest-eggs in order to supplement their
little diddums' grant. Could it be just
that the students of IC are just too
apathetic? Or could it be that this Union
needs a Publicity committee, co-
ordinated by a proper Publicity Officer,
capable of running a hugh publicity
campaign, airing the issues, informing
the Union, letting us all know that the
demonstrations supported by ICU are
demos in earnest, not pathetic dribbles.
Last year I chaired a Council working
party on Publicity and Communications.
The most important recommendation,
which was accepted by Council, was
that a Publicity Committee should be
set up under the guidance of a Union
Publicity Officer. The committee would
normally share the burden of general
Union publicity but would be capable of
running an extensive publicity campaign
at the drop of a hat.
The proposal as such was passed by
Council. The Union obviously chose to
ignore it. Last Friday shows what a
cock-up of a decision that was.
*
Such is our determination that the
feature on the subject 'Should the PG
Affairs Officer be a member of the Exec?'
should be fully exploited and well-
presented that it has been decided to
hold over the article till the next issue.
We hope that not too many people are
annoyed/disappointed at its exclusion
this week.

We welcome onto our staff the new
Technical Manager, John McCloskie,
a Zoology fresher. For Riz Shaker we
have reserved the title 'Editor without
Portfolio'. It is designed to illustrate
his immense versatility.

As must by now be well-known,
there will not be an issue of FELIX
next week. We are allowing ourselves a
fortnight's run-up to the 25th Anniversary
Issue, which will be a bumper souvenir
edition. In a nostalgic vein, it is
planned that the FELIX Banner (the Cat
and the name etc.) will be in silver.

Sir,
In answer to Mr. Lynch's
rubbish of last week's 'Letters'
column, I simply quote from my
letter to the Rector:
'...ICL provides most of the
computer facilities which are
used for processing data on
South Africans; this is in turn
used in the operation of Pass
Laws. These laws, which
involve the denial of Africans
of the right to make a permanent
home in many South African
cities where they work and
result in the prosecution of
almost one million Africans
in a year, are one of the
cornerstones of apartheid....
the issue is particularly acute,
as the manufacturers of these
computers make available the
very means by which the
system of apartheid can be
operated'.
This is clearly more than a
'dubious economic connection'.
With regard to my concern
about other 'races', particularly
the Vietnamese, I wonder where
Mr. Lynch was when I was
picketing the US Embassy
(between 1971-73) and marching
in support of the Vietnamese
people. He wasn't with us then.
I am curious as to how I can
possess an (apparently con-
tradictory) 'self-centred interest
in human suffering in other
countries'.
Finally, I don't denigrate
anything British. Come and
see my passport, if you like.
Yours sincerely,
Trevor Phillips,
President, ICU.

Dear Sir,
After today's abysmal
turnout of IC students at the
National Grants Demonstration,
we feel that only forty in a
procession of forty thousand,
many having come from as far
away as Northern Ireland,
reflects not only apathy, but
also a complete inadequacy
in communications. A couple
of mentions in FELIX is not
enough for an activity of this
importance. Why is there no
publicity officer? Although,
the Editor of FELIX is nom-
inally the Union Publicity
Officer he obviously has no
time for this job. What was
needed were a large number of
posters around college.
In addition, there were no
placards or an IC banner which
meant that all traces of IC,
bar a slop shirt dangling from
a ripped off branch, were lost
in the crowd.
This cannot be very good
for IC's image.
Yours,
R. Hasler,
B. Speed,
M.Smith.
(It is indeed gratifying to see
that at least someone has
woken up to the fact that, with
FELIX in its present form I
cannot possibly fulfil the
duties of a Publicity Officer —

Dear Sir,
Having been duly moved by
the magnificent turnout of
students at the National Grants
Demonstration I feel bound to
write expressing my horror at
the display of apathy in this
college which manifested itself
in the appalling 1
% turnout of
IC students.
Are we mice or men or, for
that matter, women, since one
of the major issues concerns
discrimination against married
women? IC students represent
a large percentage of London
student population and should
really be more capable of
social responsibility. The fact
that we are ' scientists' is no
excuse for political or social
ignorance!
In the light of the huge cuts
in educational expenditure the
