quite a response from comments, I felt I should like to con-
tinue my views in this issue.
In particular, it struck me
as rather ironic that the front
page of last week's FELIX
drew attention to sex dis-
crimination within the grant's
system and how we should all
fight this (I am referring to
married women's grants) — and
this coming from a college
which has only allowed women
in its Union Bar in the last two
years (although there was never
any union policy on this), and
where in only the last two
weeks rumours of a move to
close the Bar to women yet
again were flying around. The
generous minded of these
'gentlemen' suggested that
possibly it could be reduced to
having just one or two nights
a week 'men only'.
Have you ever heard the
like of it?! other than out of
history books. And what, you
may ask, is the reason behind
this ridiculous proposal? None
other than some men feel they
cannot 'let themselves go' in
the company of women. The
phrase In inverted commas
seemingly includes becoming
insensible with drink, followed
by puking up over the Bar
floor, to be refreshed by the
drinking of a yard, all ending
up with the customary stripping
off of all their clothes i.e.
those they've got left on.
Well, far be it for me to
point this out, but I have yet to
see such embarrassment dis-
played by the regular Bar
customers and if it exists then
so much the better. Perhaps it
will start a decline in what
can only be described as a
totally barbaric and senseless
ritual supposedly elevating the
participators to the giddy ranks
of 'being a real man'?? The
basis for this assumption fails
me completely since a 14 year
old kid is perfectly capable of
drinking himself silly, being
sick and stripping.
And if this ritual is the
cause for the movement to ban
women from the Bar yet again.
I suggest they also move to
lower the legal drinking age to
14 to include men of similar
capabilities in this initiation
ceremony to manhood.

Ladies and ....Ladies!
CAN YOU tell the difference between Betty and Marg? Three
out of four people can't. Who would guess that Betty, with long
auburn curls, gold lame top with matching velvet hip-huggers is
really Freddy in disguise? In fact, Freddy and those like him
seem to be making a much better job of being women than women
are. What has happened to the
charm of a bared ankle, flut-
tering eyelashes, the look of
helplessness and complete
dependence which once con-
quered a man far more effectively
than any Women's Liberationist
tactics? Have we indeed lost
the art of being feminine? Are
we in danger of becoming a
Unisex Society?
It is no use going about
things in a bull-in-a-china shop
fashion, a mistake too often
made by our American friends.
Ask any man what Heaven on
Earth is andhewill say 'Living
in England on an American
wage with a Japanese wife' —
and Hell? 'Living in Japan on
an English wage with an
American wife'. Our Japanese
counterparts have long since
discovered that subtlety holds
the answers.
First of all we Jadies must
accept the fact that God did the
dirty on us by giving us the
task of reproducing the species,
so that from the word go we
start off at a disadvantage.
But never a woman existed who
couldn't turn a disadvantage
into an advantage. From the
comfort of her own home a
woman can run a husband, a
business, a town and indeed an
entire nation! The sky is her
limit. Why is Heath having such
trouble maintaining his pol-
itical leadership? Simply
because without a wife to tell
him how a country is run he is
like Little Boy Blue without
his horn. 'Behind every great
man is an even greater woman'.
How true. You see this is
where women excel. It is quite
evident that we alone are the
real leaders of the world (think
of Cleopatra, Elizabeth 1,
Victoria, Mata Hari and Mary
Whitehouse) but we are clever

enough to let men think they
are. The poor fools. How simple
and unassuming! However, we
are in danger of losing our
influence because instead of
using our female charm and
highly developed powers of
whining and wheedling we are
trying to compete with men on
their own ground. The common
outcry from girls at IC is that
they do not get a fair deal, but
how many are guilty of looking
more like men, of mucking in
with the lads, drinking beer by
the yard and walking along as
if they'd just stepped down
from a horse? Establish your
identity first and then assert
yourselves. In the Battle of the
Sexes nothing but sheer
scheming and cunning will
succeed and who is better at
that than us?
You see at best a woman is
an enchanting, mysterious,
bewitching, exacting, dec-
orative, sweet-smelling,
irrational sort of creature, from
the top of her coiffure to the
tip of her painted toenails. At
worst she is a giggly, sloppy,
snivelling, empty-headed, foul
smelling, gum chewing biped —
and about as enchanting as a
skunk on a hot day.
Just to demonstrate how
successful we girls can be
when we put our minds to it I
will remind you that not so long
ago IF collected more per
person for rag than any other
USK college. However, never
let it be said that we do any-
thing by halves and this year I
should think we have collected
the least per person. Today
(Sunday 17th) .was an out-
standing example. A three-
legged football match was
arranged as a rag stunt in Hyde
Park. How many goodly females
from IF got off their spoilt
bottoms to kick a ball around
for charity? Six. Say no more.
However there will be many
more opportunities to show
your willing in the near future.
Not least the chariot race down
Oxford St. tomorrow (Saturday
23rd) and of course our very
own VICARS AND TARTS
PARTY on Friday the 29th in
the JCR from eight o'clock
onwards. There will be a disco
and some food, and drinks will
be obtainable from the bar. The
entrance fee will be a mere 30p
and the proceeds from this will
be going to rag. Prize for the
grooviest vicar and the most
delectable tart?
