Due to the success of the 'A' International XV this season,
Rob Jones the Slim King of rugby, was swamped with-requests to
play for him. From the many applications he accepted two stars
the famous winger Bo-Bo Scutter and 'The Six Million Dollar
Chunder'

The fame of the A's being so
great approx. 13.000 spectators
clambered onto the coach for
,the away match against St.
Fart's Hospital. The coach
only made it after Chunder had
stopped the traffic so that the
coach could weave its way
through the mass of traffic that
hadn't heard about the game.
Pee Burger, the famous pres-
ident of the Bladder Company,
wa seen to grimace and cross
gs as we passed Sidcup
— obviously he rem-
ied some past incident
red on h:
return from a
thei last season,
ventually the A's took the
before the capacity crowd
and after being asked to put it
back the game kicked off.
Within 5 min scored to put
the A's in the lead. B.Pants
was spectating well. Farts
scored almost straight away
from the restart the ref said he
saw the knock-on but wanted to
let them equalize, they con-
verted to give them a 6-4 lead.
scored for the A's to put
them back in the lead. Then
just before half-time Farts
scored but after having the
the linesman's flag stick up
his anus the ref disallowed it
and blew for half time (8-6 for
the A's). The linesman ex-
plained that he couldn't drink
and run the line properly at the
same time but we believe the
Frog was more interested in
sitting on leaves and catching
flies. Bo-Bo tells me he's not
getting enough mentions so I
will inform you that he was
hogging loads of ball just like
he wants to hog this report.
At half-time while A.Clapham
had a couple of drags, the
oranges were served, on a
table, and Bo-Bo told the
crowd that he was glad of the
support and encouragement they
were giving him.
After the restarts.Hindmarsh
scored after about 4 knock-ons
by R.Neal (12-6), B.Pants
continued to spectate well and
Bo-Bo wants another mention.
St. Farts nearly scored from a
breakaway but their winger
stopped so that R.Jones could
catch him up and was promptly
flattened by half a dozen A's
players. R.Jones was enioving
himself going roundrunning
into their players until he
eventually winded himself, and
he did not shout at M.Gibson
for fastening his bootlace.
Farts did score once more by
M.Gibson, R.Beddoes and
believe it or not A.Clapham
scored a try each one of which
Bo-Bo managed to convert
along with a penalty to give
the A's victory with a final
score of 29*10.
As the final whistle blew
the Crowd invaded the pitch
to mob their heroes and Farts
have been told to put up
fencing to stop such incidents
happening again. 1,000 of the
spectators in the form of Pete
Stutter-Medhurst joined the
team in the bath — it's hard
work spectating, especially
if you do it as well as B.Pants.
The team returned home
victorious and Keith did not
wet himself.

Hail the continuing come-
back of this classical English
literary column.
Our story this week returns
us for the second time this
term to the searing heat and
arid conditions of Guildford's
fair city (where the course
was so ?; gr? itty). Our first
team secured a memorable 7th
position by use of a tactical
combination of breast stroke
and front crawl, while the
second team just failed to
double that figure. The third
team just failed, inspite of the
boost • caused by the pincer
motion applied by the meta-
carpels of Mr. L.S.E. Gledhill
to the anal quarters of our very
own Ronald, midway round the
second leg (of the relay).
However, the aforementioned
harriers must be credited with
their astounding victory over
a couple of Primary School
teams.
Back next week (we hope).
R o b J o n e s
Dae to adverse weather
conditions 90% of all sports
games were cancelled last
Saturday. In fact the only game
played was an away fixture for
the A XV Rugby. As there is a
distinct lack of reports, I
thought I'd take this opportunity
to give a brief resume of the
success/failure of the various
clubs.
The Soccer club having lost
their first game embarked on a
series of wins which has
extended over at least seven
games. This achievement is all
the more remarkable (?) when
you consider that they have
played all season without the
guidance of their world famous
captain (Steve Bates).
The Rugby Club have
already been knocked out of the
Middlesex Cup, and have won
as many games as they have
lost, and last Wednesday they
started their long trail to
regain the Gutteridge Cup.
' The Hockey (Hanson) Club,
like the RFC have had a mixed
season so far, winning five
from nine games. The X-
Country Club now hold the
record for sending the most
letters to FELIX, but also have
been performing well.
All in all IC seems to be
maintaining its high standard
in sports and things are looking
exceptionally good for the
second half of the winter
season.
P.S. Let's
