government is making, which
have drastically affected this
college and are having crip-
pling effects upon other
colleges, it is surely time that
the Union rallied a little more
support for this campaign and
also that the students of IC
pulled their fingers out, (of
their ears or any other
appropriate places)!

Imperial College,
15th Nov. 1974.
Sir,
In his reply to our letter of
last week, Rob Jones stated
that his was the ultimate
responsibility for sports
reports. No doubt the complete
indifference of the Editor has
given him this impression. The
two missing articles referred to,
in fact, delivered by hand to
the FELIX office well before
the deadline — their present
whereabouts can only be
conjectured.
Last week, when one of us
actually came face to face with
you, while trying to pass on
our reports, you stated that it
could be left with you to pass
on to the Sports Editor, you
said it wouldn't do much good
as you wouldn't see him till
Tuesday (and this on a Friday).
Surely this lack of contact
between two principal officers
of FELIX is at variance with
a sabbatical Editor, which was
to promote communication
within the college.
It must cause surprise when
the Editor can completely
disavow interest in such a
large part of the production
of his newspaper. Further
action/inaction can only lie
in your hands.
Yours,
Dave Jones,
Wilf Welford.
(/ consider 'the complete
indifference of the Editor' to be
a cheap remark indeed. It
reflects the fact that you are
ignorant of the executive
procedures that exist in the
production of FELIX. The
Sports Editor of FELIX is a
semi-autonomous position and
the fact that the ultimate
responsibility of the sports
coverage lies with him does
mot reflect my indifference but
rather the fact that Rob Jones
is a final-year engineer with
many committments other than
FELIX. This essentially
precludes close consultation
on the subject of sport.
Rob clearly advertised the
appropriate channel through
which all sports reports should
go. Please use it — Ed.).

Dear Sir,
Does 'relieved' of Felix
368 really reflect the attitudes
of undergraduate chemists?
Homosexuality exists through
such a cross section of our
community that making these
denouncements is as stupid as
making them against coloured
people with big noses.
For eighteen months I have
shared a flat with gay boys:
they've made me laugh, cared
about me and been incredibly
good friends. If people are
kind, is it any concern of yours
what they do in bed? Do you
base your opinion of a girl on
whether she screws on top or
underneath? You seem so
afraid of something which, I
gather, can be lots of fun.
Gay boys can be nice or
nasty, but they have tolerance.
They don't want your 'hellos'
and, contrary to what your
vanity tells you, they won't
chase you down lavatories....
but maybe, just maybe, you
could learn a little tolerance
and a little humour from them.
Yours faithfully,
Elizabeth Wigley.

Dear Sir,
Following a long and happy
stay at Imperial College, the
place that to me epitomises
student life is the Beit
Quadrangle.
This term however, some
member of the union exec,
has imposed his complete lack
of decorum by erecting a large
black and white sign, likened
to something advertising a
holiday camp latrine, beside
the main doors.
I propose that he replace
a more suitable plaque or in
way alter the present sign to
make it enviromentally
harmonious.
Yours faithfully,
J. Syde.

Are YOU God?
'How long will you keep us in suspence?' the gathering Jews
asked the itinerant preacher. 'If you are the Christ, tell us
plainly!' (John 10. 24-5).
Mr. Shakir and Mr. Ekpenyong are in a quandry, I see. Because
we have no knowledge of God (which I freely admit: No one knows
the Son but the Father and no one knows the Father except the
Son, Matthew 11. 27) , we are left in a world of speculation. Is
there a God? If so what is God like? Can we form a doctrine of
God? Can God be measured? Can we know God? Of course we
revel in such intellectual consideration. In the past we drew
many pictures of God, like the sun, the moon, the stars, minerals,
plants or even man himself; none of which really satisfy our
curiosity today. Perhaps the greatest idea man had in this field
was a god made in man's own image, but today even this has little
hold for the emancipated mind, and 'God is Dead' or rather man is
all, he controls his own destiny, this world is his, he shall save
himself is the order of the day. 'O praise and blessing and honour
be to them who sit upon the throne! We have your name, o man,
because you have made a bed for yourself: a clean and pure
world in which you shall live and shall daily cleanse with your
"Fairy" and "Vim" and "Flash"'.
The fool has said in his heart 'There is no God' (Psalm 14).
And the Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men.
He sees they are without knowledge, and they are corrupt.
Man, you are a fool in your darkness. Open your eyes, look,
see that God is good! 'No one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him' Jesus said.
Goo has not let you remain in ignorance my friend. He has
revealed Himself to you — '/ told you, and you do not believe,
The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness tome'.
Look at Jesus man, see that He is God, He can be known!
Jesus is the express image of the invisible God, for in Him all
the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, through Him to re-
concile to Himself all things whether on earth or in heaven
making peace by the blood of His cross, and you who once were
estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds He has reconciled,
(refer to Colossians 1: 15-23).
