ON MONDAY. 18th November, Dr. Tim Challis gave a
horrifying picture on the subject of human manipulation in a talk
called 'Riot Control in England Too?', giving depth to a subject
that mainly consists of short-lived rumours, with little or no
official response.
The speaker started by
justifying the 'England Too'
part of the title. We have been
lucky since 1945 in having
experienced slow growth
conditions with little actual
disturbance. But this cannot
last; in a period of booms and
slumps civil disturbance will
occur. Dr. Challis felt that the
possibility of a growing Fascist
movement among Industrialists
or a Military coup is small. It
seems more likely that the
government will have to take
further action itself. But how
will it cope with picketing,
which by sheer weight of
numbers can get its own way?
The British government is
one of the best at stopping
non-violent subversion such
as picketing or riots in
Northern Ireland.
But it is generally felt that
their methods are too extreme,
despite the way they are
usually played down. CS gas
for one is largely taken for
granted now after the initial
rumpus of its introduction, but
there is evidence to suggest
that it has lasting effects and
is a carcinogen.
Rubber bullets sound harm-
less enough, but. apparently
three people have been killed
and many permanently injured.
They conjure up suckers on
the end of toy bows and arrows,
but the Spanish police banned
them.
The next stage is armed
confrontation, for example
when terrorists armed to. the
teeth take over some building.
Against such people, the
police are powerless.
However, when they capture
trouble makers, the government
is on firmer ground. Dr.
Challis described one of the
best methods of preparing them
for interrogation. The subject
stands in the usual police
frisking position, with a bag
over his head and is exposed
to loud white moise. He is not
allowed to sleep and is fed on
bread and water. This treatment
lasts for about three days.
Another highly successful
treatment is solitary con-
finement. It does not take long
for hallucinations to set in,
but they have to stop before
their subject goes insane; it's
a delicate subject, wrecking
humans.
But this treatment is not
solely for true IRA men and
their kin. The ordinary man in
the street in Ireland arrested
on incorrect information gets
it too. We wonder why the
ordinary Irishman likes us
so much.
THE LAST week or so has seen a number of happenings in the
Jazz Club. First on Sunday (10th Nov.) we had the appropriately
named 'Scylla' to provide us with some rock music for the Sunday
Sessions. They are a five piece band (vocals, lead, rhythm, bass
and drums) who played heavy, and perhaps a little too loud, rock.
The lead guitar playing was
inventive and interesting but
after a while the music became
too one-paced and the vocals
practically inaudible.
On Thursday we had the
dual events of a lecture by
master musician Ian Carr (of
Nucleus fame) on 'The In-
creasing Influence of Rock on
Jazz', and the Jazz Club's
Trad Jam. The former was a
fascinating event. Ian talked
about music as being of two
distinct types: western and
non-western, Jazz being a
fusion of the two. The char-
acteristics that he emphasised
for western music were, as a
written music, the possession
of harmonic structure together
with the development and
expansion of a theme. Non-
western music he saw as a
multimedia experience with the
music much more directed at
the audience, with the rhythm
structures more important than
the harmony. In the influence
of rock on Jazz he saw non-
western traditions re-exerting
themselves and rejuvenating a
medium which was rapidly
becoming sterile. To illustrate
these points he played several
rather scratched records which
covered the works of Miles
Davis, John Coltrane, and
Charlie Mingus but for me the
highlight of the proceedings
was a superb song by Howling
Wolf called 'Smoke Stack
Lightning' which was his only
example of 'rock' music.
The Trad Jam was an
altogether less competent
performance, with a distinct
lack of musicians despite the,
free beer on offer. However, it
can at least be said that those
who did tum up enjoyed them-
selves even though the
repertoire was rather limited
(tin roof blues, tin root blues
and yet more tin roof blues).
Nest week at the Sunday
Session we have 'Handbag'
guesting. You must know where
it all happens by now, so pick
up a pint and pop in.
