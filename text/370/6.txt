HIGH-PATHETIC
FOOTBALL
A l a n R . J o n e s
IT WAS a cold dry day - ideal conditions for football and
goose-pimples. The two teams, the RCSU Exec and the RCSU
ladies plus Martin Kessler (not in drag), paraded onto the Harrods
Pavement Football Stadium in their multi-variate stripes, for this
the first Theta Trophy. The crowd attendance was only moderate-
a pity considering the mag-
nificent display of football
skills that were to come.
However, the few fans that did
brave the weather, were
agitated with excitement;very
few of them could stand still
in that tension. There was
virtually no crowd violence, so
it did not really matter that the
local constabulary weren't
present. The only piece of
misbehaviour was the way that
a number of fans constantly
invaded the pitch, but apart
from one who looked ready to
use a stick on the football
stars, there were no apparent
signs of hooliganism*
The Ladies won the toss
and. elected to kick off. The
Exec chose to play into the
bookings one for dissent, the
other for sitting on the penalty
spot but then showed us his
footballing skill with a won-
derful chip shot that dipped
under the bar. However, a
penalty and a headed goal left
the Exec 5-4 up at Quarter-
Time.
During this interval the
stars decided to meet their
fans, obviously taking a lead
from Leeds. Mr. A.Sudworth
(not again) was approached by
two 'gentlemen' in trendy gear,
'Oh, haven't you got nice legs'
said one. His friend was quite
jealous. I hope Sudworth is
regretting the 'meet-the'fans'
now, as it will only alienate
wind. It was quite clear that
the referee would have to take
a firm hand to keep the two
sides apart — never has this
Stadium seen such an expanse
of feminine thighs. The referee
showed that he would not
tolerate indiscipline on the
field. Within minutes he had
allowed a goal, disallowed
another and booked Nick
Payne for arguing. It was a gem
of a first goal — a splendid run
down the wing by A. Sudworth
and rammed home by P.Teague
who had gratefully accepted
the cross.
After the Exec had had
another goal disallowed for
Score at Eighth-Time 3-3*
offside, they went two ahead
through Payne running in from
the wing. But the Ladies were
not despondent, they came back
with two quick goals — the first
one a controversial penalty
decision and the second a neat
little dribble over the line when
the Exec defence was in tatters.
Miss E.Graham was the scorer
both times. Both teams scored
again before the whistle for
eighth time. The only things
that had spoilt a first eighth of
splended football, was a
vicious foul on Miss C.Morrell
which earned Sudworth a
booking, and an even more
diabolical knee-high chop by
C. Pollard (Exec) who then
started arguing with the referee
and was promptly sent off.
The second eighth was a
scrappy affair. Martin Kessler
(Miss) earned himself two
them if the stars insist on
coming between friendships!
Many of the ladies had similar
comments thrown at them: 'If
you walk round like that any
longer, you'll get done in'.
One supporter invited Miss C.
'Blush' to 'go for a bit in the
park'. After the interval many
of the ladies failed to appear.
Some were receiving treatment,
others were taken out for meals
by the fans.
It was in the next session
that the best football was
played. Nick Payne was the
'wingless wonder' with some
beautiful feints and deft little
touches. The Ladies finally
got on top, however, despite
their depleted numbers, Miss
M.Kessler getting a hat-trick
in six minutes. He was finally
sent off though, for his per-
sistent dissent, and P. Teague
(Exec) also had his name taken
for the same offence. N.Payne
completed his hat-trick shortly
before the whistle went for
exponential-time.
Score at Exponential Time:
Ladies 9-Exec 8.
A penalty-competition
followed during the interval but
no-one really won, although
N.Davies came nearest to it.
The match was abandoned at
this point because the referee
considered that the crowd was
getting too large for safety
without police control.
