APATHETIC IC
A STAGGERING
1% TURN-OUT
AT GRANTS DEMO
A SHAMEFUL number of about forty five students gathered
near the Union Arch to proceed to the march and rally which was
the climax of the Week of Action for better grants.
This meager total re-
presented less than 1
% of
college, and raises the
inevitable questions as to the
reason for such a poof turnout.
One main cause no doubt was
the poor publicity within IC;
no posters appeared on the
notice boards; many students
did not know about the march
till Friday while some freshers
enquired if 'we were going on
strike'. Ultimately respon-
sibility must lie with the
Union Executive which as a
body should have realised that
a lot of publicity was needed to
arouse interest in the 'trad-
itionally apathetic IC students'.'
An army of students
approximately 30,000 strong
wound their way along the
traditional route for student
demonstrations to Hyde Park
corner. A new feature of the
march was the large number of
students from colleges of
further education Involved. The
march passed without incident
despite the occasionally
successful attempts of the
police to split the group into
several small sections. This
unnecessary action caused
feelings to run high though the
organisers may have been as
much to blame. Inexplicably
there were virtually no stewards
to supervise the march, this
could have been dangerous
and should not happen againl
The students regrouped in
Hyde Park for the speeches.
The group filled most of Hyde
Park corner but all were able
to hear clearly thanks to
excellent loudspeaker arr-
angements.
The first speaker was
Denis Skinner, (MP), of the
tribune group in the Labour
party. He was followed by
Richard Goodacre of the
Birmingham College of
Education and John Randall the
NUS President. One of the
major issues dealt with was
the cuts in educational
expenditure. All the speakers
stressed the absurdity and
futility of these cuts.
The gathering was told to
continue their fight against
discretionary awards; the
Means Test; the Spouses'
contribution; the anomalies in
married women's grants and
the call for higher grants for
all was reiterated with renewed
vigor.
Denis Skinner rejected the
government suggestions that
the cuts in education were
necessary. He called on the
Labour party to withdraw the
one thousand million pounds of
loans they have recently given
to industry and scrap such
'ludicrous' projects as the
channel tunnel. He asked for
SHAFTESBURY
RE"OPENS
WITH ITS ceiling now repaired, the Shaftesbury Theatre is to
reopen on Monday, December 16th, with West Side Story and the
Wombles Christmas Show.
This announcement last
Tuesday is the culmination of
intense pressure and wrangling
by the 'Save London's Theatres'
campaign to thwart the original
proposals by the freehold
owners of the site, Peureula
Investments Ltd. It is under-
stood that this company, part
of KeyserUllmann, the merchant
bankers, were considering
demolishing the building as
part of a larger development
plan for that area. But a number
of leading theatrical per-
sonalities (including Sir Alec
Guiness, who apparently took
part in a picket) fought to save
the theatre through a well-
co-ordinated campaign.
It was about 18 mont'ss ago
that the musical 'Hair" had to
be cut short when the ceiling
fell in (fortunately not during a
performance). Some were
disturbed by the fact that this
incident occured only 48 hours
after Peureula Investments had
actually bought the side with
the view to develop it.
But be that as it may, the
theatre has now been completely
renovated at a cost of 'less
than £100,000 - well less'.
The building contractors Scott,
Brownrigg and Turner were
extremely happy with the
results they had achieved: a
company representative said
'That ceiling is now as safe
as houses'.
A three year lease on the
building has been given to
West End producer Bill
Kenwright, but it is basically
a tortuous deal since he will
have to outlay an estimated
£2,000 per week in order to
staff the box office, bars
etc. — the production costs
come on top of that.
the money to be spent on more
houses and student hostels.
Richard Goodacre stressed
the hardships faced by
students in further education
establishments as a result of
the discretionary award system
and asked the students to
fight against this facet of the
grants system.
John Randall pointed out
that students face a struggle
for survival of their colleges
and themselves. The former
due to cuts in the grants to
colleges and latter due to the
treatment of students as second
class citizens and the laughable
sums they are suppose to
'exist' on. He told the students
that the effect of the indifferent
and hostile attitude of the
successive governments has
become tragic from being trivial
a few years ago. The students
were asked by Mr. Randall to
continue to take the way
forward shown by students all
