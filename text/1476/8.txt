Tuition fees: Bearable burden o
Felix speaks to graduates about the old system, the proposed changes and how greatly the
The latest higher education reforms have
not been without significant resistance
from many, with one of the key issues
being the fear of significant debt follow-
ing a proposed increase in tuition fees.
Current graduates are no strangers to
debt, with many owing several thousand
pounds following their degree. Felix
sought to discover just how dramatically
the current system affects graduates and
whether they themselves approve of
the impending changes or stand against
them.
All prospective and current students
who are citizens of a European Union
member state are eligible for an an-
nual tuition fee loan which matches the
yearly cost of their course. For the vast
majority of students, this figure current-
ly stands at £3,290, and rises each year
with inflation. Additionally available is
a maintenance loan, up to a maximum of
around £3,500 (higher for London stu-
dents). Total student debt upon gradua-
tion therefore, for most students making
maximal use of both of the loans avail-
able over three years, will stand at at
least £20,000.
Daisy Cantalamessa, 23, a graduate
from the University of Manchester, ap-
plied before the current system of top-up
fees was introduced, though feels that it
is “a fair [system], although I think we
should be given more control over how
much we pay back.”
Repayment of the debt is structured
such that a certain percentage (9%) of
earnings above a minimum threshold
(currently £15,000 in annual earnings) is
automatically collected from a universi-
ty graduate’s pay packet, similar to a tax.
This means that someone earning the
UK’s average graduate salary – around
£25,000 – will repay 9% of £10,000 per
year, (£900) in debt contributions. At
this rate, it would take over 20 years to
pay back the full extent of the loan, not
taking into account interest, which does
not cause the amount owed to rise in real
terms.
The introduction of top-up fees in
2006 was itself not without controversy
– not least due to the extreme closeness
of the 2004 parliamentary vote , and the
involvement of a number of Scottish
members of parliament – whose con-
stituents are unaffected by the changes
– voting for their introduction.
Tony Blair’s Labour government ar-
gued in 2004, despite their 2001 election
manifesto claiming that the party “[had]
no plans to introduce University top-up
fees, and [had] legislated to prevent their
introduction”, that the changes were
necessary for the country’s universities
to remain internationally competitive.
Indeed, the Russell Group of Universi-
ties, which includes Imperial College,
supported their introduction. The gov-
ernment took the position that because
university graduates on average earn a
significant (though disputed) amount
more over their lifetimes, it is reason-
able for them to contribute to the cost of
their tuition.
Tom MacDonald, 26, a graduate from
Northumbria University, determinedly
believes the current system to be suit-
able: “Even though I prefer not to lose
so much money a month, I borrowed the
money in the first place and now I have
to pay it back. I don’t see the point in
moaning about it because it wasn’t my
money in the first place.”

tudents from Medsin Impe-

Square on Wednesday in a
flashmob designed to raise aware-
ness of the problem of patents re-
stricting access to anti-retrovirial
drugs. They planned to jump into
the fountains, symbolising placing
anti-retrovirial drugs in the ‘patent
pool’. A combination of extremely
cold conditions and a stern ‘oh no
you don’t’ from the police unfortu-
nately thwarted their plans. The stu-
dents also sent a letter to Glaxos-
mithkline/Viiv Healthcare calling on
them to sign their HIV drug patents
over to the UNITAID patent pool.

Vince Cable says that the new proposals, which double/triple tuition fees
but increase the repayment threshold, are fairer than the current system
“Opponents argue
that because society
as a whole benefits,
the general public
should shoulder the
financial burden”
