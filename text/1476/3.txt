Around 400 University of Essex stu-
dents marched through Colchester
city centre.
Several thousands students led
police on a cat and mouse chase
around London as they dodged
police lines and avoided ‘kettling’.
Accusations have been traded over
whether police attempted to block
the protest before it began. Protes-
tors eventually converged on Trafal-
gar Square where 146 were arrest-
ed after being kettled and clashing
with police. Occupations continue
at SOAS, University of East London,
Goldsmiths, Roehampton and UCL.

Around 100 students from the Uni-
versity of Cardiff protested in the
city centre as the Welsh Educa-
tion Minister Leighton Andrews an-
nounced that Welsh students would
have higher fees of £6–9,000 paid
for them with public funds. Students
have been occupying a lecture the-
atre since the 25th of November:

In scenes similar to those in Bir-
mingham, around 30 students
stormed the Oxfordshire County
headquarters. An occupation of
the Radcliffe Camera building
at Oxford university has now
ended.
The city’s council chamber was
stormed by around 50 protestors.
Scuffles were reported but the
small demonstration was, by
and large, peaceful.
An estimated 200 students
marched in Liverpool in a “wild-
cat” demonstration which saw
brief clashes with mounted police
and two arrests.
A grassroots
movement
S
tudents and school children across
the country have been marching in
the streets and occupying university
buildings to protest against cuts to teach-
ing, higher fees and the loss of the EMA.
They have been largely unorganised; a
grassroots movement that has developed
through Twitter and Facebook. The graphic
isn’t comprehensive. It’s only a snapshot of
the protests on the 30th of November, but
it gives an impression of the widespread
anger felt by students across the country.
