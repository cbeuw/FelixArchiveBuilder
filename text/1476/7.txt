Disabilities Officer
resigns criticising
‘lack of disabled
access’ in Union
The Union’s commitment to disabled
students was called into question last
week as the Union Disabilities Officer
resigned saying that the Union “should
be leading the way in accessibility for
students, not lagging behind the rest of
the university”.
In a letter published in Felix Nicola
Hopkins described the difficulties she
faced whilst in her position, especially
as the role is voluntary and part-time.
Hopkins explained that she had “raised
the issue of the lack of disabled access to
the new Union venues and that the dis-
abled lift in the Union Building is faulty
and therefore unusable for disabled stu-
dents. Neither issues has been resolved
to date (8 weeks later)”. Among other
problems Hopkins felt the lack of ur-
gency was disappointing since the Impe-
rial’s Disability Equality Scheme states
that all “refurbishments have considered
accessibility as a major priority”. With
all this in hand Hopkins decided to step
down.
In response to Hopkins’ resignation,
Deputy President (Welfare) Charlotte
Ivison said she was “very sorry to see
Nicola leave” but said that some of the
issues raised by Hopkins are being re-
solved. The lifts in the Union Building
will be “fixed as soon as possible” and
there are plans to have push button doors
to each of the bars. However the issue
of a drop bar (a lowered bar to allow
wheelchair users to be directly served at
the bar) was considered unfeasible “in
terms of cost and inconvenience when
considering the number of students it
will benefit.” Although the Union did
say, “To minimise the problem caused by
not having a drop bar, all the bars have
staff on hand to offer an assisted service
to any students who may need it.”
Nicola Hopkins responded positively
saying, “I am pleased to hear that the
Union has taken on board my sugges-
tions and look forward to seeing them
put in place soon.”

do more or have any suggestions for im-
provements, email dpwelfare@imperial.

people were reluctant to talk to me until
I explained that I was from a student
newspaper. Offers from media organi-
zations for coverage of active protests
are considered cautiously, after the
coverage of the NUS protest march.
In general the protestors understand
the importance of a good public im-
age. I asked a student whether he felt
any resentment toward the media; he
shrugged and said that while the media
coverage was skewed, he believed that
the publicity generated by the contro-
versial pictures really helped bring the
issues into the spotlight.
Looking around the room, it is clear
that the initial response has been good.
But what about in two, three, or even
four weeks time? Are there any plans
to stop protesting? Talking to several
students, they seemed resolute to keep
protesting until the issues which they are
concerned about are addressed. One stu-
dent grimly stated that she is prepared to
“go down fighting”.
To see this level of commitment, pas-
sion and enthusiasm from a generation
often labelled as disinterested and fickle
is truly awe inspiring. Even if you do not
agree with the reasons for the protests,
even if you do not agree with the protest
methods; the unity and solidarity shown
by these ‘New Student Protestors’ is
something which you can not help but
admire.

Organising the protests
I
n response to the govern-
ment’s proposal to increase
the tuition fee cap and cuts to
higher education, protest groups
have been ‘popping up’ all across
the country. Each of these pro-
test groups are independent of
each other, which means the ac-
tual methods of protesting and
key decisions are made by the
individuals within the group.
Who joins these groups?
There is no ‘stereotypical’ pro-
tester; members of these groups
are as diverse as the student
population they represent–
stretching across a range of
ages, different ethnicities and
backgrounds.
How do they protest?
The main methods of protesting
used by these groups are occu-
pation and demonstrations. An
occupation is where activists
‘take over’ a room and refuse
to leave of their own accord un-
til their demands are met. They
often use the room as a base of
operations. A demonstration is
a street protest, where activists
march en masse to a designated
endpoint. An example would be
the NUS marches on the 10th of
November.
How do mass protests occur?
Although these protest groups
are independent of each other,
many of them keep in contact
using social media such as Face-
book and twitter.
This means that groups all
around the country can collabo-
rate for mass protests-such as
the student protests earlier this
week. Groups mainly use the so-
cial networks to contact each
other, sharing opinions, giving
advice, updating each other on
progress and sharing messages
of support. These sites are also a
means for students who are not
part of the group to show sup-
port or complain about the activi-
ties of the group.
