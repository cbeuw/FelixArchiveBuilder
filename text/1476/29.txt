S
ometimes, being a music
lover can be a tough job. You
fork out £20 to go and see a
really exciting new band at
Brixton Academy or HMV
Forum. You then queue for ages in the
cold. Once you’re in the venue’s sound
system sounds like it’s playing through
four inches of cotton wool and a sweaty
seven foot yeti man decides to stand half
an inch in front of your face. Sigh. It’s
not always that bad, but there is another
way to see live bands that is cheaper,
more intimate and often has better qual-
ity music than the main concert halls.
Tucked away down side streets, in base-
ments and attics away from the crowds,
small gig venues give you the opportu-
nity to see the bands that will be playing
the big venues in a year or two’s time
up close and personal at a fraction of the
price. Here are a few of the best ones:
Madame Jojo’s:

ATTICS &
BASEMENTS
Beloved by Pitchfork, Jay-Z and Be-
yonce as well as your humble reviewer,
Beach House are a well regarded two-
some emanating from Baltimore that
comprise of Alex Scally and Victoria
Legrand. This scruffy and seductive pair
have been riding an ever-growing wave
of critical adoration since 2004 which
now appears to be translating into a wid-
er commercial acclaim, as evidenced by
healthy sales of their beautifully beguil-
ing 2010-released LP Teen Dream and
their sell-out gig at the Shepherd’s Bush
Empire.
Opening with ‘Glia’, Beach House
instantly do more than simply reproduce
the layered textures of their distinctive
‘dream pop’sound on record, in the flesh
the intricacy and beauty of their sound is
fully realised. Scally’s guitar parts and
effects linger delicately providing the
perfect foundation for the most distinc-
tive element of Beach House to shine,
that is Legrand’s sumptuous drawn-out
husky voice.
Legrand could be the ghost of the Vel-
vet Underground’s Nico: her vocals
have the very same low and powerful
resonance, which – despite their limited
range – fixate you, sucking you into the
realm of this enigmatic femme fatale. Le-
grand cuts a captivating presence, pitched
somewhere between a youthful Horses-
era Patti Smith with swathes of messy
black hair and the subtle swagger of Cat
Power, she captures the hazy melodic
rhythms of her band with elegant sways.
Teen Dream is showcased in its en-
tirety, fragmented by early singles such
as 2008’s ‘Heart of Chambers’, allow-
ing the set to flow smoothly. Highlights
include ‘Better Times’ and ‘Used To
Be’, the former beginning with wonder-
fully simple repetition of a piano chord
and is a slow-burner climaxing with
Legrand crying out: ‘The one that you
love is gone’. ‘Used To Be’ is cut from
the same cloth, with Legrand hauntingly
warning: ‘Don’t forget the nights, when
it all felt right’.
The ambient quality of the music of
Beach House is typified by ‘Zebra’, this
abstract hymn is delivered with tremen-
dous energy, beginning with infectious
guitar and lengthened high-pitched or-
gan soundscapes. This breath-taking
track builds and builds, becoming soni-
cally more and more expansive but never
losing its sense of melody, with Legrand
again at the fore, echoing: ‘Anyway you
run, you run before us, black and white
horse, arching among us’.
There is little conversing with the ap-
preciative crowd, a notable exception
being Legrand metaphorically remark-
ing that together in our collective at-
Beach House are the cherry on the cake
The sultry Legrand of Beach
House brought the room to a
standstill
zy strip club, but on Tuesday nights it
sees some of the most exciting breaking
bands from all over the world gracing
its doors for the excellent White Heat
Club. You usually pay £5 to go down
into the faintly lit basement, where three
or four bands will play up on a curtained
podium with DJs afterwards. Names
such as The xx, Wild Beasts, Dan Le
Sac, Noah and the Whale and The
Kills have been on the billing before.
The Lexington:
96-98 Pentonville Road
The Lexington is basically a pub for
hipsters. Downstairs is the main pub
area, which has some pretty crazy dé-
cor with chandeliers, buffalo skulls on
the walls and big fancy sofas, making
it look like a baroque hunting lounge.
DJs play great music, the bar special-
ises in American brewed beverages and
you can even get some hearty pub food.
Climb the spiral staircase up to the at-
tic and there is a second bar and gig
venue where bands play most nights.
Prices can be very variable, but if you
keep your eye out there are a few free
album launches held there, and White
Light (the sister club to Madame Jojo’s
White Heat) is held every Friday, with
DJs playing until late afterwards.
tendance we are part of a ‘good cake’,
appropriately bowing in reverence to
the crowd. This evening is quite a big
deal for the Baltimore duo, their biggest
show to date and they seem keen to earn
these stripes, playing with real urgency,
verve and intensity throughout.
The set culminates with ‘Take Care’,
an alluring and serene song that waxes
and wanes with power and grace. Just as
it majestically closes the LP it makes a
perfect closer this evening.
However this was not to be the fitting
ending as the pair returned for an encore
including the epic ‘10 Mile Stereo’. I
was a little underwhelmed by the ‘big
finish’ nature of the encore, backed with
pulsating percussion and screeching
keys, for Beach House are most impres-
sive when they hold back, allowing Le-
grand to take centre stage. Nonetheless,
it was a commanding performance, with
stripes fully acquired and definitely well
worth the hype.
Horse and Condor at Madame Jojo’s
The Book Club:
100 Leonard Street, Shoreditch
This one is a really eclectic and crazy
venue: it always offers something un-
usual and fun. You never really get a
bog standard gig here. DJ sessions or
Band nights can be accompanied by arts
and crafts nights, film showings, life
drawing classes, spoken word poetry or
anything in between, and prices range
from free gigs and £1 gigs to more ex-
pensive nights up to a tenner. They also
host an infamous Electro Swing night
where club goers dance their feet off to
DJs sampling 1920’s tunes with hip hop
beats.
That’s just a sample of the great fun
that can be had on a budget and the
fantastic hidden treasures of London’s
small gig venues. If you like the sound
of the venues above and are looking
for people to head out to these places
to with, feel free to message Imperial
Alternative Music Society at alt.mu-
