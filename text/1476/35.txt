The first Christmas dinner of the season... Yummy in my tummy
F
or me, hall Christmas din-
ner was one of the highlights
of first year. It made sense
we’d pay homage to our
newly adopted family and
celebrate Christmas together with the
basting of an oversized bird and a vat
full of mulled wine. A good excuse to
reminisce about the first term’s antics
(with much naming and shaming), get
a little snozzled and eat pig wrapped
in pig; hall Christmas dinner is not to
be missed. Staircases seven and eight
of Selkirk Hall came together and our
twenty strong team of culinarily chal-
lenged, blurry eyed students actually
produced a feast of a meal (despite my
meagre contribution of peeling approxi-
mately three whole root vegetables) .
To test some of our recipes we did a
dry run of Sunday lunch inviting fifteen
of our closest friends. The main learn-
ing points were as follows:
• It is not normal to look well turned
out and completely in control when
cooking for this number of people;
Delia Smith and Nigella Lawson lie.
• It is probably important to have a
glass of wine to hand, particularly
for the last hour or so of preparation.
• There can never be too much meat.
Meat wrapped in meat is a particular
hit with all. Except vegetarians.
• Once everything is cooking and
when everyone’s together it is well
worth the effort!
Here’s our guide to preparing Christ-
mas dinner. I hope the recipes and tips
serve you well!
Citrus and Thyme Turkey
Of all the things to be prepared for our
hall Christmas dinner, the turkey (chick-
en in our case because it worked out to
be cheaper!) was the thing that scared
everyone the most. After a term of par-
tying hard and sleeping little, our pal-
ates were more familiar with Kentucky
Fried than home-roasted, and our culi-
nary skills hadn’t quite reached their full
potential. Nevertheless someone on our
staircase took on the Delia challenge and
made an amazing job of it. Once you’ve
worked out the correct time to cook the
bird given its weight, it’s actually not
that scary. Here’s a flavour packed reci-
pe that is easily adapted to chicken:
2 Bunches of thyme or lemon thyme
1 Orange
1 Lemon
8 tbsp Olive oil
4.5-5.6kg/10-12lbturkey, thawed if fro-
zen, giblets removed
4 Bay leaves
4 Carrots, halved lengthways and cut
into chunks
1 Large onion roughly chopped
50g Butter
Stuffing (homemade or bought)
Chop the leafy tops of the thyme (set
aside the woody branches for later).
Finely grate orange and lemon zest into
the same bowl. Add olive oil and sea-
soning, mash the mix with a spoon to ac-
tive the flavours and set aside to infuse.
Heat the oven to 190C/Gas5. Put the
stuffing into the neck of the bird and
push it towards the breast. Stuffing will
expand when cooking, so don’t overfill!
Secure the neck flap with a skewer.
Weigh the stuffed turkey and calculate
the cooking time (18 mins per 450g).
Season the turkey generously inside
and out. Halve the orange and lemon
and put it in the cavity, (squeeze the fruit
as it goes in) along with the remaining
thyme branches and 2 bay leaves.
Put the chopped carrots, onion and re-
maining bay leaves into a large roasting
tin. Sit the turkey on top of the vegeta-
bles and smear the butter over the skin.
For a really tender turkey you can add
the same amount of butter under the skin
from the neck.
Cover with a loose tent of foil. Roast
the turkey for the calculated time, bast-
ing with the pan juices every hour. Half
an hour before the turkey’s ready re-
move the foil and leave to brown. After
15 mins drizzle with the thyme oil.
How to know if the turkey is cooked:
Insert a skewer into the thickest part of
the thigh. The juices should run clear. If
they’re still pink, then cook for a further
20-30mins and test again. A turkey of
this size should take about 3 ½ hrs.
Perfect Roasties
Roast potatoes make or break a Sunday
roast for me. Should Christmas dinner
disaster strike, the loss of the turkey
would be nothing compared to the loss of
perfectly golden crunchy on the outside,
fluffy on the inside roasties. Some peo-
ple swear by goose or duck fat. Whilst
running out to the Serpentine might be
a cost effective method of acquiring our
own, as students, I think butter will do
just fine. My trick is a mixture of veg-
etable oil for crispiness and animal fat
for flavour with a sprinkling of flour to
create those extra crunchy edges.
16 Potatoes (Desiree, King Edward,
Maris Pipers are all good)
2 tbsp Plain flour
150g Butter/Goose or Duck fat/dripping
3 tbsp Sunflower or vegetable oil
Salt for seasoning
Heat over to 190C. Peel potatoes
and cut in half or leave whole if they’re
small. I recommend leaving them rela-
tively large so they’re manageable.
In a saucepan cover with cold water
and bring to the boil. Allow to boil for
2 mins.
Drain and then toss in the colander to
fluff up their surfaces. This will create
that crunch. Sprinkle over the flour as
you go and finish with a good sprinkle
of salt for seasoning.
On the hob, place a large roasting
tray over high heat and add the fat and
oil. When sizzling add the potatoes and
brown for 5mins, turning occasionally
so that all sides are covered in fat and
getting a bit of colour.
Roast for an hour, taking the tray out
every 20 mins and turning the potatoes
to allow them to cook evenly.

Roasted Autumn Veg
When the mulled wine is flowing and
you’re panicking trying to cook your
first ever turkey, a one roasting dish rec-
ipe like this makes life a little easier. It
combines all the usual Christmas dinner
suspects; carrots, parsnips, red onion and
potatoes. But infused with thyme and
whole garlic cloves roasted in their skins,
suddenly veg is no longer a dreaded ob-
stacle to the meaty star of the Christmas
dinner plate. With minimal preparation,
you can throw them all in a pan together
and once in the oven can forget about
them until you’re ready to serve.
8 Large carrots
5 Parnips
100g of New Potatoes
4 Red onions
Cloves of 1 bulb of garlic, in their skins
6 Springs of thyme
5 tbsp of vegetable oil
Salt and pepper to season
Cut the carrots and parsnips into chunky
portions (batons 1.5 x 1.5cm, 5cm in
length).
Quarter the red onions. Cut in half again
if they are large onions.
Slice the new potatoes in half. Leave
whole if they are small.
Peel the outer layer of the garlic and
separate into cloves, leaving them in
their skins.
Combine all in a roasting tray. Pour
over the oil and seasoning and evenly
spread the thyme throughout the tray.
Toss the vegetables to ensure even coat-
ing in oil.
Roast in an oven at 190˚C for 1hr 15
mins. Toss at regular intervals.
Garnish with fresh thyme and/or
chopped fresh parsley when you serve.

Survival Time
plan
With a floor or staircase of people
helping, prep should be done in
no time. Then you can get down
to the real business: hanging out
and having a team mulled wine.
Getting everything ready for the
same time can be harder than it
looks, but here’s a rough plan to
help get things rolling:
10am Preheat the oven to 190˚C/
Gas 5. The turkey should ideally
be at room temperature. Prepare
the turkey and put it in the oven.
10.30am Get your mulled wine
on… it makes the next few hours
whizz by and gets even the most
hung over on your corridor drift-
ing into the kitchen.
11am Start prepping all of your
veg. Store potatoes and sprouts in
bowls of water until they’re ready
to be cooked. Make stuffing balls
and pigs in blankets. Store in the
fridge until ready to be cooked.
11.30am The turkey should have
had its first hour. Remove from
the oven, baste and return to the
oven foiled. Repeat an hour later.
1pm Get your roasted veg into
the oven. Start boiling your roast
potatoes and get them in the oven
when you’re ready.
1.30pm Turn your roast potatoes
and give your roasted veg a quick
toss. Pop stuffing balls and pigs in
blankets in the oven at this point.
2pm Take your turkey out.
Check if it’s cooked and leave to
rest for half an hour. Start making
your gravy.
2.15pm Put some sprouts on to
cook in a pan of boiling water.
2.20pm Whack some frozen
peas on. They’re quick and
easy and Christmas dinner just
wouldn’t be right without them.
2.30pm SERVE!!
