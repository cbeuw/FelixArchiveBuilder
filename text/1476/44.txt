I propose
a game of
Fives!
Alun Meredith
Eton seemed like a fitting venue for Im-
perial’s first official Eton fives tourna-
ment as a society.
Sixty eight players competing in pairs
from seventeen different universities de-
scending on the birthplace of the sport
to prove they have the best teamwork,
coordination and skill in the academic
world.
Best described as squash with your
hands, Eton fives has only three walls
and a multitude of ledges modelled on
the alcove of Eton school where it was
first invented. The ledges made the
game unpredictable, coining the phrase
“a game of hazards”.
The universities tournament is tra-
ditionally dominated by Oxford and
Cambridge who, with their own courts
in numerous colleges made a third of the
turnout. This year, however, the London
teams, spearheaded by Imperial’s Tom-
my Fagen brought the pain, losing only
to the Cambridge first pair in the pools.
Meanwhile the London second team
with our very own Raju Patel beat Ox-
ford’s fourth pair with a dominating
score (12-2) in their first game but nar-
rowly lost the top two slots that would
have seen them through. Their fortunes
changed in the plate and they beat their
two Cambridge rivals to see them take
third place. Tommy Fagen and partner
passed through the quarter finals without
incident but in a cruel twist of fate found
themselves against the same Cambridge
first pair that kept them from the top spot
in the pools.
After a long couple of games the pair
found themselves out of the competi-
tion. Congratulations to the pair who
achieved a top 4 position out of the 34
pair turnout. In the girls competition we
are proud of the London first pair who
beat Oxford in the finals; the first time
Oxbridge hasn’t taken the prize.
Fives is an extremely fast growing
sport, only now breaking out of the
secondary school mould; we have just
formed a Fives society to catering from
all forms of fives and one wall hand-
ball.
If you want to try this unique, friendly
and social sport, contact the fives soci-
ety at fivesclub@imperial.ac.uk which
allowing you to be placed our mailing
lists so you can be kept up to date with
upcoming events. There will also be a
free introductory session for all novice
fives players on the 8th of December.

Imperial 3s 45 - 27 Brunel 6s
The dedication of the Netball 3rd team
to their training finally paid off with
a thrilling 45-27 win over Brunel on
Wednesday.
The Imperial girls went into the game
with mixed feelings, as that Brunel have
a rather impressive reputation when it
comes to Netball. However, captain Lu-
cie’s Christmas themed team joke of the
day set the girls in good spirits for the
game.
Play started poorly for Imperial with
Brunel overturning their first centre
and scoring. Defenders Nakai and Fern
worked hard, along with centre court
players Becky and Sarah, to get the ball
back down to the Imperial goal third.
The girls’ hard work paid off as they fin-
