Scorpio
You are Luke the Skyfighter. You get
cornered by the Dark Knight called In-
vader or something, and he tells you
he is your father. You are horrified and
shocked, and don’t believe him. Having
lost your hand, R2Z2CPO7 finds a med-
ical centre for you. Star Wars V ends.
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS

Horoscopes
Aries
You are a child psychologist who works
with a boy that can see dead people. You
have been unknowingly dead during the
entire encounter, you tell your living
wife you love her, and you leave behind
the world of the living. Now don’t both-
er watching The Sixth Sense.
Taurus
You spend 139min watching a film
about a guy who hates his job, so forms
a fight-club with a soap salesman. After
138min of sub-standard shit, there’s a
“clever” twist which reveals that the two
blokes are in fact the same person - this
apparently makes the film epic.
Gemini
You run a motel. Your mother murders
a female guest that you fancy. Actually,
you are your mother. You murdered the
real one after catching her with a lover.
Consumed with guilt, you try to erase
the crime by bringing her to life in your
mind. Psycho? You bet.
Cancer
If it hasn’t taken you 6 pain-stakingly
slow movies to figure it out yet, Harry
Potter is bullshit. Let me save you the
time of watching the last 2. Voldemort
dies, Snape is good, the kids all grow up
and live happily ever fucking after. It’s a
kids book, what did you expect?
Leo
You chase a killer that commits his crimes
based on the seven deadly sins (yeah,
he’s quite the moralist). You become the
embodiment of “wrath” by murdering the
serial killer after he presents your wife’s
head to you in a box. Seven killings in
one movie? Definitely worth watching!
Virgo
You date a girl that turns out to be in with
the bad guys. She’s the only girl you ever
loved. She drowns herself. Embittered,
you travel to Russia to find the bastard
that turned her. You then have hundreds
of meaningless, empty shags and never
get over it. You become James Bond.
Libra
All work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy. AlL WORK AND nO PLaY
MaKES Jack A DULL bOy.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy. All work and no play makes Jack
freeze to death in the snow and you see
his dead face. The Shining rocks.
Sagittarius
You are a maths genius that was promised
a single room but have a roommate (see
where this is going?) He becomes your
best friend. Turns out he is not real,
and you have been hallucinating. You
make two more fake friends. You have a
Beautiful Mind.
Capricorn
You are travelling in space and crash
land in 3002 on a mystery planet ruled
by apes. Go on, guess the twist... yes,
the planet is in fact Earth and you only
realise this right at the end of the movie
when you see the Statue of Liberty. It’s
the Planet of the Apes.
Aquarius
Inception. It’s when you enter peoples
dreams in dreams in dreams... clear?
No, and the characters are confused too.
At the end, they no longer know the
difference between reality and dreams.
Although wait 20min after the credits
and they tell you the answer.
Pisces
After 13 blissful years as a happy kid,
you become a compulsive masturbator,
before fucking a few girls and
questioning your sexuality. You study
dull shit at IC, get a mediocre job, get a
mediocre wife, and die a pretty mediocre
death at 72. That is the end of your life.
“Potter Fans desperately try to
find Diagon Alley”
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
I know how you feel mate. You’re drunk, home is far away and you can’t bear the idea of walking in on me and
your girlfriend doing the dirty. BOOM!
