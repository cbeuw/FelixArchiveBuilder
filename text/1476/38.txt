The w0rld Expla1ned by
Dunc-E, the clumsily-
programmed and seriously
misinformed robot
when its begins t0 start sn-
0win, s0me0ne is like 0mg
it’s sn0wing and every0ne
runs t0 the wind0w and is
like but they cann0t see the sn0w be-
cause there is hardly very much sn0w but
pe0ple are still excited because England
never gets sn0w s0 even a bit of sn0w
is exciting. Then it keeps sn0wing and
every0ne is like yey 0mg it’s still sn0wing
and every0ne is g0ing yey and then but
we all decide we are n0 longer want the
sn0w because there is t00 much. The
end
This week Dunc-E

THE BIG FREEZE
An interview with a real-life
student protestor...
Hello there, what’s your name?
NO IFS NO BUTS, NO EDUCATION
CUTS.
Hi umm sorry, excuse me...
NO IFS NO BUTS, NO EDUCATION
CUTS.
Can you please stop shouting in my
face? What’s your name?
I can’t tell you my name. It’s too
dangerous.
Too dangerous?
You don’t know man, the risks that I
take… the police are watching man,
they’re always watching and then they
come to your house. And plus my mum
will be well pissed off if she finds out
I’m missing lecture.
What are you doing today?
Protesting man, we’ve got be heard. our
views can’t just be ignored
Your views? And what are they?
NO IFS NO BUTS, NO…
Alright, alright enough of that.
Do you think the violence is justified?
Well I mean the police start
it, I mean they’re just standing
there in hi-vis and stuff.
like they’re just asking for
trouble.
What about the Millbank violence?
Yeh I mean we’ve got to be heard. I sup-
port all of it. Except you know when that
guy threw that cat off the roof. I mean, I
ain’t got nothing against cats. Cats aren’t
destroying our higher education system.
It’s the cuts that are ruining everything!
Cat?Theguythrewafireextinguisher!
Yeh whatever, they all go ‘woof’anyway.
What? Never mind… What do you
think of Nick Clegg?
He’s a total cunt you know, I mean, I
would totally rape him… Not in a gay
way I mean. More like in a “take that
Nick!” kind of way.
WHAT?
Yeh for real, I mean he’s raping our uni-
versities with his cuts so it’s only fair
and progressive and all that.
That’s terrible! God... Umm do you see
the need for spending cuts because of
the huge deficit? Do you accept that?
Naw mate we shouldn’t be cutting, we
should be building and sewing. Cross-
stitches and all that mate. We need to con-
struct and thread together instead of cut-
ting, slicing and chopping and... umm...
uh, NO IFS NO BUTS NO EDU...
Do you honestly
flick straight to
this trash? You
seriously pick
up the paper
and the first
thing you read is
Hangman? You
disgust me...
Hangman risked kettling and near death to talk to an idiot
student protestor in his natural environment
What a fucking knob... Ahem sorry! I mean what a brilliant display of
radical anti-authoritarian direct action Comrade!!!
