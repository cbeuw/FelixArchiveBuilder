FELIX

Power: I’m not used to it. My last laptop
was not a gaming powerhouse; it strug-
gled to run even modest stuff smoothly.
Like Solitaire, say. Or Word.
But like all electronic machines it
eventually developed human emotions,
and in a desperate act of self-gratifica-
tion managed to tempt some local thug
to steal it from my flat by blinking its
red LED in the window like some two-
bit, silicon-chip seductress advertising
its pathetically slow services. The slag.
Anyway I got over her... er, it, and
now a year later I’ve invested some
good money into a good laptop. And
with this good laptop has come a whole
new world of tweak-able settings.
No longer do I settle for just playing
with the TV’s contrast and brightness
to get my power fix. Now I can dial up
resolution and dial down texture qual-
ity at will! I can add soft shadows and
remove water reflection in a flash; end-
lessly flicking things on and off , test-
ing the difference, moulding uncanny
worlds of half-sense at my leisure. It is
compulsive. Hours can slip by as I mar-
vel at light refraction in water pools or
abuse the gamma slider like I actually
know what gamma is. In other fields of
life this crazed amount of fiddling and
ogling is frowned upon and, if you’re a
teacher, even jail worthy. But these PC
game menus practically encourage de-
viancy, to break out the settings scalpel
and peel back the layers of illusion.
And that peelin’ is mighty revealin’;
you learn so much. It’s like being some
digital Da Vinci, ripping apart the anat-
omy of graphics and sound to work out
how bytes became beauty.
But here’s the really magical thing:
as you dig deeper and deeper into vir-
tual world’s strata of effects, you soon
start digging back into our own world.
It’s like grabbing a spade and digging
straight down in Hyde Park: sure you’ll
start your journey ploughing through the
sediments, the igneous and the meta-
morphic like some GCSE geography fe-
tishist (or perhaps a materials student).
But after getting through the magma
in the middle, you start chipping away
back to the surface, learning the process
backwards and ending up in our world
again. Well, Australia.
First, you might go to Specsavers and
be amazed that when you wear your new
frames, the world doesn’t go all jerky to
compensate. Next you might start ap-
preciating the late afternoon shadows
stretched languidly across the streets.
See life in a fresh gamma value
Omar Hafeez-Bore The near-silent hum of street lamps
suddenly becomes significant and the
floatiness of snow an even greater thing
of wonder. The machinery beneath our
world, the clockwork laws we take for
granted, suddenly take on a new rele-
vance when made from scratch by game
developers. Lighting, physics, texture,
animation, feedback, camera, controls –
all are crude, megabit mirrors onto our
own world. But close enough to fill fo-
rums with mouth-foaming fanboys com-
paring hair-strand-clarity between PS3
and Xbox 360; close enough for critics
to wax lyrical about Ico’s Mediterra-
nean lighting or the convincing tarmac
in Gran Turismo 5; close enough to get
worryingly excited about the realism of
rubble weight in Crysis 2 and most of
all, close enough to look upon our own
world again with some wonder.
Do games not teach you anything?
Then you are missing out. With a little
thought, games are an education in ap-
preciation.

Elder Scrolls V to
be Oblivion sequel
Journalism is all about being in the right
place at the right time, as proved again
this week by Danish gaming magazine
Eurogamer Denmark. One of their edi-
tors took a plane with someone from
Bethesda who just happens to be work-
ing on the next Elder Scrolls game.
The unnamed source, with “game
papers in hand”, confirmed that the
next title in the series will be a direct,
chronological sequel to the 2006 smash
hit Oblivion. The project has been in de-
velopment for more than two years and
will run on a heavily modified version of
the Fallout 3 engine. The game is appar-
ently “ready to show” but Bethesda are
yet to release more details.
