to park your car in college next
session you must obtain a form
and fill it in. When doing so
please write down' all the
information asked for since it
helps considerably in sorting
out the 193 successful app-
licants from an expected total
of nvpr 600
I must advise you however
that you will be far better off
not bringing a car into London
at all: but if you insist on
doing so, please remember that
there will be strong competition
for each permit.
These application forms are
only for registered students,
all other people should apply
through their department.
Accommodation
Several people have come
into the Union Office over the
last couple of weeks asking
for accommodation.
As I'm sure most of you
realise, there are no places
left in halls, houses or Union
f!atc
for the ^nminq ^ps^ion.
There is an accommodation
bureau run by the University
of London with a branch at 8,
Princes Gardens. Another
bureau, run by USK. is situated
at Queen Elizabeth College
Union Office. You should
also be able to get some help
from Dave Salisbury. the
Accommodation Officer who can
be found somewhere around the
Union building, keep an eye
open for signs.
E lections
Maybe you have never given
it much thought, but PG's are
as e I igibie to stand for elections
to a Union post as anyone else.
At the beginning of term
there will be several elections:
Mech Eng and Chemistry
Departmental reps: Carnival
Coordinator: a Floor rep:
committee members for External
Affairs. Welfare, Community
There are only a tew things to write about at the moment, as
things are, as I m sure you will realise, rather quiet over the
summer.
Parking
Application forms tor parking permits are now available from
the Union Office. If you wish

Duty Officers
These have been sadly lacking
for the past few years. The
recent increase in discipline
offences and violence on Union
premises has prompted me to
re—introduce the system of duty
officers. Unfortunately, not
many students seem to care
enough about their property to
want to do the job. So (here is
a plea from the heart) how would
you like a go at being duty
officer in either Southside or
the Union one night next term?
Drop me a line or ring Int. 3915
and tell me or leave a message .
Lastly, to those of you taking
resits — Good Luck!
