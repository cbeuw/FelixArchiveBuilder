FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION F R E E !
No. 361 FRIDAY 13th SEPTEMBER 1974
F I J I A N S D E L I G H T I C
COURTLINE OWE SUMMER
ACCOMMODATION £Z5fi00
Courtline, the holiday
tour firm which recently
went bankrupt, has
Imperial College as one
of its creditors to the
extent of £25,000. It
appears that the firm
made several block
bookings with the
Summer Accommodation
Centre and whilst the
normal practice of
providing a bond as
collateral was tacitly
expected, somehow
such a bond was not
adequately chased up
by the person respon-
sible.
The Courtline, com-
pany is still in the
Receiver's hands.
There are a multitude
of other creditors who
are patiently waiting to
see if they will get part
of their money back.
AS IS plain to see, an
exuberant Fijian dance
troupe recently visited I.C.
apparently in connection
with the International
Festival of Youth Orch-
estras. They gave a
dazzling display in front
of Queen's Tower and
then moved on to enter-
tain Southside, still
dancing and generally
freaking out.
