PRESIDENTIAL
After five weeks as President of Imperial
College Union, it is perhaps appropriate
to take a look at two of the major issues
which are, at present, confronting stud-
ents, particularly postgraduate students.
I do not propose, at present, to do more
than outline these issues and indicate
my attitude; this is neither the time nor
the place to do more.
First and foremost — postgraduate
grants. All SRC award holders will have
received letters telling them that they
were not getting their increase until
January. Since then, pressure from the
Department of Education and Science
has caused a rapid reversal of the
SRC's attitude, and you will now be
receiving the increase in October's
cheque. Strangely enough, the DES had
to be told by the NUS and the Colleges
(certainly this one) that the SRC was
had "neglected" to let them know! Did
I hear someone say "Bloody bureau-
crats"? _ .
The reaction that I have had from
some PG's to the level of their grant
(£960) was one of disappointment.
Despite the welcome concession of
the London weighting, the Govern-
ment has given us a palliative, not
a decent grant. Coupled with this,
the DES, presumably at the Treas-
ury's insistence, has taken a step
backwards by the introduction of the
spouse's contribution.
It is clear that no—one is prepared at
this point to spend more on postgraduate
education. Yet everyone is complaining
that there are not enough students doing
postgraduate work, and wondering why.
I need hardly point out to a postgraduate
the massive difference between his
income and standard of living, and that
of the man in industry — even if, as is
often the case, the latter is doing
precisely the same work as the former,.
Both the DES and the Committee of
Vice—Chancellors and Principals have
set up working parties on postgraduate
education.
It is doubtful whether they will
recognise what is needed — a com-
plete revamping of the system of
postgraduate education, to make it
more flexible, more realistic, and
more worthwhile; but students,
through direct pressure on and dis-
cussion with the colleges, and
through NUS, should contribute
directly to the debate on postgraduate
education. What is needed now is
not piecemeal grant increments, but
that postgraduates be treated as
they deserve.
Many students have complained to me
about the rise in refectory prices on 1st
August. The Governing Body decided,
at the end of the summer term, that it
was necessary to raise prices to meet
inflation and rising costs. We argued
very stongly at that meeting that not
very strongly at that meeting that not
only could students' pockets not stand
it, but that raising prices would do little
good, because many students would
simply stop using the refectories, unless
there were a vast improvement in service
and quality. The way to increase turn-
over, we said, was to serve better food
in a more acceptable way — let's face
it, you're hardly encouraged to eat in
Southside by the service!
They did not accept this (though I
believe that the autumn term accounts
will prove us right), and increased prices
by 17Vz% across the board. However,
they did concur with our view that the
real culprit was not Mr. Mooney, but the
UGC (from which the college derives
Trev Phillips
most of its income), which has a rule
that refectories cannot be subsidised.
The Governing Body is, in effect, comm-
itted to the view that refectories cannot
be run without subsidy in a time of high
inflation, and is therefore to make rep-
resentations to the UGC, to drop the rule.
In the short term, I hope that we can
prove our point when the Union refectory
reopens; the service and quality over
here has improved enormously. I believe
if we were to hold the prices here down
to the old level, that the increased sales
would easily cover costs, and the form-
ula of "low profit margin, high quality
and good service" would have proved
itself.
I have had a request from an over—
60's group in Fulham for help; anyone
who can spare the time, particularly if
you can entertain by singing, etc., let
me know. Any help would be appr-
eciated.
I have not yet named my column.
The best suggestion wins a prize — or
something. (How about Preci Pice? -Ed.)
Finally, two quotations about another
presidency:—
"Sir, I would rather be right than be
president". (Henry Clay, U.S. Senate,
1850).
"I am not a crook". (Richard Nixon,
1973).
