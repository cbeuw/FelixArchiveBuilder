natural, but as you can see, her
reluctance was short—lived.

QUESTION
ON FRIDAY, 5th July, a
theft was committed in Fal-
mouth Hal I to the tune of £350.
A stereo, two cassette
decks, 50 records and £15
cash were taken from Physics
third year Ian Reid's room
whilst he was with friends
at the cinema.
Tne decision to go and see
a film was taken shortly before
they left at 7.30 p.m. with the
door of the room locked. At
8.30 p.m., Paul Wadsworth, last
year's Editor of F E L I X , and
owner of one of the cassette
decks, knocked on the door of
the room (though he did not try
the handle) and got no reply.
At 11.20 p.m., when Ian and his
friends returned, the door was
L E T T E R OF ACCEPTANCE
= REGISTRATION?
SUMMER
ACCOMMODATION
WHEN A 1st year P . G .
overseas student with a
letter of acceptance to
Imperial College asked to
be put up for a few nights
at the Summer Accommod-
ation Centre, he expected
to be treated as an I . C .
student and to pay the
student rate of 70p per
night. Imagine his surprise
when he was asked to pay
the full tourist rate of
£2.45 on the grounds that
"he i s not an I.C. student
until he has registered in
October".
Ahmad Vakilzadeh, the
office manager, told F E L I X
that there was consider-
able discussion in the
S. A . C . office as to whether
the full rate or student
rate should be charged
andMrs.Spencely-Collins,
this year's Scheme M a n -
ager, put the matter to
College Block but in the
meantime took the decision
to charge the full rate of
£2.45, which the student
had no option but to pay.
Finally, clarification
came from Mr. C . K . Mc—
Dowall (Chairman of the
Overseas Students C o m m -
ittee) and it i s understood
that " i f overseas s t u d -
ents produce their letter
of acceptance ... they will
be treated as registered
students". F E L I X put it
to Mrs. Spencely—Collins
that a refund to the s t u d -
ent might be appropriate.
Her comment was " I
don't know about that".
The Summer Accommod-
ation Centre i s essentially
a hotel scheme which i s
run every summer. Hall
rooms are let to tourists
at standard hotel prices.
It i s believed that the
major part of the profits
from the scheme are used
to help run the halls during
the term. The scheme
employs students to act
as cleaners in return for
a free room and roughly
£10 per week in wages.
Cleaners this year
criticised the apparently
new policy adopted by the
scheme to the effect that
many of the cleaners were
"crammed into the triple
rooms of Garden H a l l " —
as one cleaner put it. It
seems that in the past,
cleaners have been able
to have a room in one of
the newer halls (e.g. L i n -
stead or Southside).
Many blame the triple
room situation on the fact
that, at one stage, the
scheme was hopelessly
overbooked, but it was
nevertheless eventually
agreed to pay the cleaners
a bonus equivalent to 4
hours overtime per week.
and the theft, thought to be
an "inside j o b " , had been
committed.
The police were called but
with so many master and s u b -
master keys in existence, their
job cannot be described as easy.
Even Mr. Argent of College
security who went to great
lengths to interview many of
lan's acquaintances was unable
to come up with anything concrete
The position of the College's
insurance policy now raises
questions regarding its adequacy
because it makes provision
only for forceable entry and
covers loss only up to £200.
Fortunately, Ian and his g i r l -
friend, who lost the 50 records
and £15 cash, were covered by
their respective parents' p o l -
icies, but not so Paul Wads-
worth who is apparently just
pressing optimistically a claim
on the College policy through
the normal channels.
Ian Reid
"College policy should be
more clearly explained to
students regarding up to what
sum and under what circum-
stances they are covered" is
Ian Reid's view, but F E L I X
wishes to raise the question:—
Recognising the apparent ease
with which this theft was
carried out, is the College
insurance policy adequate?
Granted that 'forceable entry'
tends to eliminate the poss-
ibility of claims turning out to
be pranks, but would not a
police statement to the effect
that they were satisfied that a
burgulary had been committed,
be sufficient?
And only three weeks
previous to the theft, the
Student Halls Committe did
state that they considered
"£200 insurance cover too low".
