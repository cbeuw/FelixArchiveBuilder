10 FELIX
W E E K S MALL:
The present
situation looks
gloomy
IS WEEKS HALL about to fall down? The answer
is :— in the short term, probably not, but in the long
term it is quite a possibility. Ever since it was
built fifteen years ago, Weeks has been dogged by the
fact that the concrete block facings just under each
window were continually
crumbling and creating a
potential hazard for
passers-by. Contractors
work on the replacement
of the blocks started at
the beginning of the
summer at a cost estimated
to be in the region of
£40,000.
There is speculation
as to why the blocks are
falling apart. Mr. P.W.
Throsby. Warden of Weeks
Hall, suggested that it
might be 'natural decay
from moisture etc.', but
several engineering P C s
have suggested to FELIX
that in fact the building
may have be inadequately
designed, the gist being
that holes for the central
heating pines had to be
drilled^ right through the
concrete blocks and this
tended to disturb the
inherent tensile strength
of the concrete.
As though this were
FOR SEVERAL weeks now,
there have been wild rumours
about the existence of a new
species of carnivorous
mammals known as Homo
super sapiens postgraduate
(PG for short) writes our P iG
correspondent, Tom Abraham.
Unfortunately, it has been very
difficult to verify these rumours,
the main reason being that they
are indistinguishable from the
run of the mill Homo sapiens
like you and me (Speak for
yourself — Ed). However,
intrepid researchers led by
Prof. Abe Rahim are hard at
work trying to isolate this
species. Abe Rahim is 96.
(And he doesn't look a day
older than 22 — Ed).
During a recent interview,
Prof. Rahim admitted that
although progress had been
made, there was still 'a long
way to go'. A few specimens
had been obtained and a thorough
examination of their internal,
external and mental char-
acteristics was being carried
out by a group known as the
ICPGG. When he had app-
roached one of the specimens
it had emitted a loud screech
which necessitated an instant
withdrawal. The screech
seemed to sound something
like 'I want to go home to
mummy' (God these space fillers
just get worse — Ed).
Speaking about his efforts
to isolate the species, Prof.
Rahim said that late last year,
some specimens betrayed
themselves when they suddenly
realised that they were being
given insufficient meat for a
type of mental activity known
as demonstrating. After a
lot of whining and groaning,
they did manage to persuade
the authorities to vitually
double their meat allowance.
However, these specimens
quickly disappeared once it
appeared that they had won
their objectives.
When I made a comment about
the haggard, unkempt and
under—fed look on the faces of
the specimens, Prof. Rahim
cited two reasons for this.
One was the extraordinarily
long queues in Southside due
to a virtual takeover of College
facilities by another species
popularly known as sub—humanae
to belong to the genus Homo
sapiens). The second reason
was the extremely pitiful amount
of money set aside for the
preservation of this species.
However, since the overthrow
of Col. Heathco by Col. Wislon
in the recent bloodless coup,
he was more hopeful about an
increase in the grant (written
before the government an-
nouncement — Ed).
Finally, when confronted
with the rumour that there were
1500 specimens in or around
Imperial College, Prof. Rahim
retorted 'Bull***t'. He
categorically stated that only
two specimens had so far been
isolated and he had both of them.
Readers will be kept informed
about any advances in this
most exciting field of research.
not bad enough, misfortune
struck Weeks Hall again
when it was discovered
that the concrete in the
beams supporting the
building was a special
quick—drying, high alumina
type and it was concrete
of this nature which,
apparently, was thought
to be responsible for the
roof of a school collapsing
about a year ago.
As a result consultants,
Messrs. Clarke, Nicholls
and Marcel, were appointed
at a cost of £8,000 to
assess the hall by means
of a physical test involving
deflectometers provided
by the Civil Engineering
Department here at IC.
It would appear that
further internal re-
inforcement work on each
room is a possibility
which is not being ruled
out. Meanwhile, it has
just been learnt that
Weeks Hall will be
evacuated for at least
the first term. Presumably
the hall residents will be
filtered into places in
residence created by
students who fail their
exams and Vlth formers
who fail their A-levels.
It is tough luck on
those who are top of the
reapplicants reserve lists
though.
