Riverboat
Party Recipe
Richard Upton
To produce a delightful
late summer entertainment
proceed as follows:
Ingredients.
(a) 100 people - (Imperial
College Post Graduates and
their guests).
(b) 1 river - (the Thames is
ideal).
(c) 1 boat - (sturdy but un-
glamourous, e.g. the St.Mawes
Castle).
(d) 1 bar — (well stocked, not
too small).
(e) 1 discotheque — (assorted
dancing music).
(f) sausage rolls and crisps to
taste.
Method.
Collect all ingredients
together at Tower Pier early
one evening (say 30th August
1974). Wait for boat crew to
arrive then cast off vessel.
Play music and cruise down
ingredient (b) past Greenwich.
Turn boat around (more advent-
erous chefs might like to
continue to Amsterdam orHaifa).
Proceed back up river admiring
lighted bridges, buildings etc.
N.B. During the preparation
various ingredients may become
over agitated. This may be
due to excess alcohol or loud
music. College union Pres-
idents and newspaper Editors
(part of ingredient (a)) tend to
absorb too much of contents of
ingredient (d). There is nothing
that can be done about this
problem. Carry on enjoying
yourself and hope for the best.
If you are really lucky trouble-
someelements may be completely
immersed in ingredient (b).
When the exercise has been
successfully completed return
(a) and (c) to starting position.
Many who have partaken of
this recipe maintain it could be
sampled annually with few ill
effects.

THIS HAPPENS to be the
second P i G affairs corner
although few of you will
realise it. The first one
appeared in the last issue of
P.G. News, but unfortunately
the top end was cut off (it was
painfull). This, by agreement,
will appear as a regular column
in F E L I X — when the Editor
decides to produce one (and
when this PiG decides to write
something — Ed.). I do not
intend to use this column to
sermonize, in spite of the fact
that most P G ' s are apathetic,
uncooperative etc. etc., but
only to tell you of the good
news.
It has so far beeri a dull,
dreary, rainy summer. Most
of us were probably hoping for
a quiet peaceful summer, when
the undergrads left. However
that has not been the case,
because somebody up there,
in their infinite wisdom,
decided to bring in American
tourists to keep us company.
We are told that the money that
we get from them is used to
keep down Hall fees. Well,
I guess we have got no choice
but to suffer the inconvenience.
The ICPGG, which stands
for Imperial College P o s t -
graduate Group, is organising
a few events. A l l that i s
required for these events to be
successful is for postgraduates
to participate in them. We
also hope to show some films
between now and the end of
September and these will be
advertised as widely as possible.
There have been few Union
activities during the summer.
Part of the reason lies in the
apathy among many postgraduate
students. However, the main
reason is that many of the
clubs and committees cease
to function over the holidays.
I am hoping that this state of
affairs can be reversed, and
hopefully in the coming session
these things will be put right
under the dynamic leadership
of Yours truly.
ICPGG has a committee
consisting of the P G Affairs
Officer who acts as chairman,
a secretary, a treasurer and
one representative from each
department. At the moment
many departments are not
represented on the committee.
Will anybody (there are app-
arently 1640 P G ' s somewhere)
interested in helping out in any
way, please get in touch with
me.
