Prof Slams
UG Standards
PROFESSOR J.R.A. Pearson, of the Department of Chemical
Engineering has publicly criticised undergraduate standards.
In a letter to New Scientist, Prof. Pearson says that 'Few of
them have much grasp of the subjects they have studied' and on
the subject of professional competence, 'in many cases they will
clearly never become 40'.
He goes on to blame the trouble
chiefly on the rapid expansion
in numbers which universities
have undergone in the past
fifteen years and expresses his
dissatisfaction with the
government policy which
governs such expansion.
Not to be outdone by this,
Mr. Steve Webb, a research
assistant in the Cosmic Ray
Group in the Department of
Physics, put pen to paper in
defence of undergraduates.
He stated the point thatcriticism
should be more appropriately
leveled at falling lecturer
standards and the deterioration
of staff/student contact. He
also makes a valid distiction
between education and training
— 'It has never been the claim
of departments teaching pure
science and mathematics that
they are preparing people for a
job'.
Both letters are reprinted

Sir,—Your leader on jobs for
women graduates (Comment,
27 June, p 743) prompts me to
say that it is high time somebody
told the truth about the abilities
and achievements of most
graduates in science and
engineering on leaving univers ity
in Britain. Few of them have
much grasp of the subjects
they have studied. They do
not understand the fundamentals
and they have little idea of
how to apply them. The gap
between what is hoped for in
their examination or thesis
performance andwhat is achieved
is regularly depressing. It is
frivolous to suppose that these
graduates are professionally
competent, and in many cases
they will clearly never become
so. What is surprising is not
that a small proportion are
later employed as technicians
but rather that so many of them
are employed professionally at
all. Small wonder that their
salaries have fallen in relative
terms.
About 15 years ago some
voices were raised against rapid
and massive expansion of the
university system and it was
argued that there was not a
sufficient untapped reserve of
talent to maintain university
standards as they had been
traditionally understood. We
now know that these forebodings
were justified.
Falling average standards
may have no serious re-
percussions in some subjects.
They are, however, disastrous
in professional disciplines,
particularly in science and
technology. Yet we pretend
that they have not fallen. The
government assumes that a
nationally uniform three—year
undergraduate course is still
an adequate period of formal
training for our leading tech-
nologists. It is not and it is
time that they encouraged
excellence and continued study
among the more ambitious and
gifted students. Extravagant
plans for tertiary education
have already exceeded what
the national budget will stand.
Cuts in the real value of
university grants have already
been made. It is now no
longer possible to be en-
thusiastically in favour of a
general increase in student
numbers without further en-
dangering the quality of our
output.
This is not to put the blame
on a desire to teach science
and engineering as widely as
possible, nor on the students
themselves. It is an indictment
of those who should be insisting
on righting the situation but
who instead pretend that all is
well.

Sir,—In suggesting that falling
standards in graduate ach-
ievement are responsible for
falling salaries in graduate
employment, J. PearsontLetters,
4 July, p 46) appears to be
putting the cart before the
horse. He suggests that
science graduates do not
understand the fundamentals
of their subject and have little
idea of how to apply them. If
this is so it is not for the
reason implied. The quality
of students admitted has not
deteriorated as departments
have expanded. What has
deteriorated is the personal
contact which once existed
between staff and students and
an atmosphere congenial for
study. It is an insult to
reduce a student to a mere
statistic. The most that too
many students, having difficulty
with their work, can expect is a
few somewhat grudgingly
spared minutes with their tutor,
and lecture halls are too crowded
to permit sensible questioning
at that time. Meanwhile
courses become tougher and
lectures move more rapidly to
advanced work, often wrongly
assuming that the fundamentals
will be covered elsewhere.
While it is the most they can
do to take down notes during
ever faster delivered lectures
and questions are discouraged,
it is hardly surprising that

WHEN A group calling itself the Communist U n i -
versity of London (C.U.L.) decided to hold a week—long
conference (7th — 14th July), in the IC Union building,
one event which could not have been anticipated was
their decision to pass a motion condemning the
presence of the knickers
in the Union Bar. 'Sex-
ists!' came the communist
accusation, 'take your
knickers down!'. But
things got beyond a joke
when, on the Friday
evening, an intrepid
communist acquired a
long pole in order to remove
these feminine garments.
Big Andy Clapham
easily wrested the pole
from the assailant but
clearly by this time things
had got beyond a joke.
Nearer to closing time,
another incident marred
the C.U.L. 's hitherto
spotless record when one
of the barmen, Alan
Larson, was apparently
threatened with a beer
glass.
On re-opening the
following evening, the
members of the C.U.L.
re—generated the previous
night's provocation and
Brendan Clemments,
another barman, closed
down the bar and allowed
only registration card-
carrying IC students onto
the premises.
As a result of these
events, Mr.J.A. Lane, the
C.U.L. organiser and
former ICU President, had
£20 of his deposit forfeited.
students have little time left
over to think what it all means.
Ability to remember vast tracts
of such lectures for examination
being considered all important
does not exactly help, either.
As to the criticism that
graduates have little idea how
to apply their studies, Pearson
seems to have confused ed-
ucation with training. It has
never been the claim of de-
partments teaching pure science
and mathematics that they are
preparing people for a job.
Perhaps the lack of job-
satisfaction presently being
experienced by the products
of such departments is evidence
that the nature of courses
should change, particularly as
opportunities to remain 'inside'
university are decreasing
rapidly. Progress and come
about only when lecturers are
prepared to dirty their hands a
little and see what is really
required of new graduates.
The message comes back loud
and clear that in their present
form they are not required.
Perhaps in the very near future
we should be seriously drawing
a clear distinction between
activities inside a university
which are geared to future
employment and those for the
edification of the soul. If
both were afforded equal value
there might be some chance
of educating a less frustrated
graduate who can find his place
in society.
