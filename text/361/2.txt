FELIX goes offset-Utho
IT H A S F I N A L L Y H A P P E N E D .
At long last we are now able to print
F E L I X on our own offset—litho unit.
We have already published the Union
Diary (which incorporates the College
registration card) and the new—format
Bluebook which now has Societies
information. The results from these
two publications have been fairly
impressive.
Establishing the printing—unit and
making it operational has been by no
means an easy task. In the past six
weeks, various mechanics have made
a total of about ten calls to repair/
adjust faulty equipment — which e x -
plains why it has been impossible to
produce a F E L I X at an earlier date.
Now that the first F E L I X of the year
has been completed, it just has to be
sighs of relief all round. And we
really have to thank Kyrle Gillespie,
our litho operator, for all the suggestions
and guidance which he has given in these
early stages. One wonders what would
have happened without him.
A journalist's nightmare is surely
one where a particular story undergoes
major developments just after it has been
written and set in print. What should
he do? Does he rip the story out and
rewrite it or does he plead ignorance to
being aware of further developments?
One such instance has occured in
connection with the story of the c o n -
struction work being carried out on Weeks
Hall. At first, the issue was the reason
why the concrete slabs were falling off
the front of the building; then it was
discovered that the concrete used in
the beams (not the slab facings) of the
hall were made from the same cement
which caused a school's roof to collapse
about a year ago. So clearly the major
issue now is :— What happens if further
internal construction work if required
in Weeks Hall? (STOP PRESS It is
understood that Weeks will be evacuated
for at least the first term and its future
is indefinite).
It tends to be a feature of many
'first editorials' for the Editor to guffaw
and ramble on about plans for future
issues and generally to make promises
which he can only be vaguely sure of
being able to keep. I do not plan to
do that sort of thing, so there. Yaboo
sucks and whoopee.
Copy date for the Freshers' Day
issue will be Friday, 20th September.
Copy received after that date will be
zapped to smithereens at the Editor's
discretion.
PG's Tutoring &
Demonstrating
Rates

AS SOME of you may well know, we have been campaigning on
this issue for over a year. After intermittent negotiations over
a long period of time, the final outcome has been a college
decision to the effect that:
'I. With effect from 1st October 1974, the rate of pay for part-
time student demonstrators
should be the inclusive sum of
£2.00 per contact hour for any
form of demonstrating and
tutorial work. The new rate
is inclusive of preparation time
for which no additional payment
or allowance should be made.
2. The new hourly rate is tied
to the lower end of the Lecturers'
Pay Scale from Ist October 1974,
and will be increased by the
same percentage addition as
may be applied to that scale
from time to time, subject to
the constraints of Government
legislation, UGC direction or
advice from the CVCP'.
Both the fact that the rate
for demonstrating is £2.00 per
contact hour, and that this is
tied to the lower end of the
Lecturers' Pay Scale is welcome.
However, since this is inclusive
of preparation time, it means
that effectively there is no
increase in the tutoring rate.
This point has been taken up
with the College and we hope
that some sort of solution will
be found. It would help our
case if the P G ' s doing tutoring
work could get in touch with me
and tell me how much they are
earning at present, because the
rate appears to vary from dep-
artment to department.
LORD BLACKETT, Senior Research Fellow of the
Department of Physics died, aged 76. in July.
His scientific career sparred some 55 years during which he
became one of the world's most distinguished scientists. Among
the many honours he gained were a Nobel prize, the Presidency
of the Royal Society, an Order
of Merit and a life peerage.
After a Naval cadetship at
Dartmouth, Patrick Maynard
Stuart Blackett served as an
officer at the Battle of Jutland
during the first World War.
Leaving the Navy in 1919, ha
went to Cambridge to work
under Rutherford. His work
there, on the bombardment of
nitrogen with alpha-particles,
along with his experiments on
cosmic rays (which led to the
observation of the positron),
ensured his international
reputation.
Blackett left Cambridge for
Birkbeck in 1933 where he
worked for four years; it was
at this time that he set up an
experiment 100 feet below
ground, in Holborn tube station,
to measure the penetrative
power of cosmic rays.

The outbreak of war found
him in the Anti-Aircraft Com-
mand, where he made significant
contributions to the defence of
blitzed London, in terms of his
research. Later on in the
war he worked for the Admiralty
again doing very valuable
research for Bomber Command.
It is said that in this period,
his early naval training proved
invaluable.
In 1948, he received the
Nobel Prize for his work on
the Wilsen cloud chamber and
on cosmic rays. He published,
in the same year, a controversial
book entitled 'The Military
and Political consequences of
Atomic Energy', in which he
analysed the potential effects
and use of the Atomic Bomb.
Blackett criticised die thesis
that atomic bombs would or
should decide any East-West
military conflict, and put
forward the view that the world
had to learn to live with the
Bomb, before it could control
or abolish it.
Blackett came to IC in 1953
and remained here. The 60's
saw him as one of the architects
of the Labour Party's policy
on Science and Technology,
and in 1964, he became a
scientific adviser to the Ministry
of Technology.
He became President of
the Royal Society in 1965,
holding the post until 1970,
and in recognition of this and
his other achievements, he
was awarded a life peerage in
1969.
Lord Blackett leaves a
widow, a son and a daughter.
