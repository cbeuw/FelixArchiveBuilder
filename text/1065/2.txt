Manager, warns that a committment
to renovate the hall could reach far
beyond the £600,000 initial estimate
as more problems may be found in
the fabric of the seventeenth century
building. While Mr Black agreed that
Montpelier is a popular hall and does
'work well', he dismissed the
'College myth' that it had to be used
as hostel accommodation. "There are
no restrictions on the use of thte
building as far as I am aware', insist-
ing that his examination of the prop-
erty deeds revealed no 'legal obliga-
tions'.
to purchasing the prime site. In 1991
when Montpelier was officially up
for sale suggestions were made that
college was looking for around
£12m.
With recent safety problems at
other college sites, the 'integrity' of
could have influenced the decision to
empty the property. Accidents over
the Summer with sash windows
crashing down on cleaning staff are
but one example of the problems
experienced with the hall, originally
built in 1865. Concerns over leaking
guttering and the ancient wiring in
the hall have all contributed to the
It was originally intended that
Montpelier should be sold to finance
the purchase of Clayponds,
College's housing estate in West
London, but the late 80's property
crash precluded the previous attempt
at selling the hall. While Mr Black
insists that no effort has been made
to market the property again, a
steady stream of developers have
approached the College with a view
September 1997 closure deadline.
Despite the obvious need to pro-
vide a better standard of accommo-
dation, the housing of seventy five
postgraduates freshers will clearly be
difficult. Despite College gaining an
increase in their UL Intercollegiate
Hall allocation, the deficit of conve-
niently located beds will not be recti-
fied until the opening of the planned
Prince's Gardens Halls.
Beer-can thugs face disciplinary
continued from frontpage
though he was suprised and worried
that so dangerous a stunt had taken
place.
The student was not a resident at
Southside, being "...a friend-of-a-
friend" and so will not have to face a
resident's tribunal. The student will,
however, be facing a disciplinary
hearing, where it will be decided
what action is to be taken. A disci-
plinary committee consists of the two
senior tutors, two members of the
Imperial College Union Council, a
clerk from Registry and a dean of
one of the constituent colleges as
chair. Severe action may be taken by
the College, "being drunk is certain-
ly not an excuse" commented Dr
Hassard.
D A N G E R O U S CYCLISTS
Belgravia Police Station has received
a flurry of complaints from members
of the public recently, concerning
students cycling on pavements in the
campus area.
PC Coleman warns students and
members of staff at IC that it is an
offence under council bye-laws to
ride on the footpaths and pavements.
In the interest of safety he recom-
mends that students should use the
road instead - that is what it's for. If
anyone is unhappy riding their bicy-
cle on the road they should push it
along the pavement instead. Any IC
personnel or student caught riding on
the pavement will be reported and
liable for prosecution. If the police
do not deal with the incident, then
Imperial College will discipline the
person(s) involved.
In addition to cyclists, roller-
bladers are increasingly becoming a
problem on campus. Non-slip sur-
faces have been laid on several steps
as a trial to prevent people rollerblad-
ing on the walkways, said Bill
Oldridge, from the Estates division.
"We are looking at alternatives, as
the trial has not been as successful as
had been hoped. Rollerbladers are a
potentially serious problem; security
staff have been abused, and bladers
are injuring themselves. They are a
danger to themselves as well as oth-
ers, and College has a duty to protect
people from them" he added.

WEATHERS
The Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
was rendered temporarily unable to
leave the college on Wednesday fol-
lowing a problem with his security
clearance.
The Rector's chauffeur-driven car
was reportedly denied access at the
Callendar Road entrance when the
driver's swipe card failed to raise the
automatic barrier. One security
source commented that due to a com-
puter error the car may not have been
registered as leaving the campus, and
so been prevented from re-entering.
Another blamed "loose wiring" in
the card-reader.
LIBRARY FIRE A L A R M S
S A W N T H R O U G H
There was some question as to the
safety of summer users of the
Imperial College Library when, due
to neccesary building works, some
adaptations were made to the Library
fire alarm systems.
Problems with rewiring meant that
in certain areas alternative proce-
dures had to be introduced.
However, the Library staff, Fire
Officer and Fire Alarm Engineer
were fully aware of the situation at
all times. All problems have now
been dealt with and the Library is
again able to function without the
worry of additionalfirerisks.
C A M P U S C A M P I N G
In a scene reminiscent of the last
night at the proms, IC undergrads
have resorted to sleeping rough in an
attempt to snap up the few remaining
spaces in halls.
It appears that this year a relative-
ly large number of students have not
been allocated accommodation in
College residences despite rumours
that suggest that rooms are lying
empty in halls.
On October 5th, the first weekend
of this term, Students ignored
requests to wait until Sunday before
queuing at the Accommodation
office in Prince's gardens and were
found to be waiting on the steps in
order to be at the head of the queue
the next morning. However, during
the middle of the night security
guards moved the slumbering stu-
dents away as "they constituted a fire
risk". Ken Weir, Chief Security
Officer, was unaware of the incident
until informed by Felix, although
later several students reported it, and
is making his own investigation.
BIKE CODING
Those of you who haven't had your
bike confiscated for riding on the
pavements can take it along to the
ante-room in the Sherfield Building
to have it marked with your post
code for security. Police will be
offering this service free of charge on
October 28th, 29th and 30th. More
information will be available closer
to Monday 28th.
It might well be worth taking
advantage of this service, as parts
have been stolen from eight different
bikes since the beginning of term.
Security have advised that the safest
place for bikes is on the RSM walk-
way, which is covered by four sepa-
rate CCTV cameras. To date, noth-
ing has been stolen from this area.
