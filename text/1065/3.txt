Judo session enlivens Elections
KENT YIP
Imperial College Union's Council
line is almost complete after elec-
tions held at its first meeting of the
year. Two officers and seven ordi-
nary members were elected at the
meeting last Tuesday, but the last
minute withdrawal of candidate
Emma Dedman still leaves the posi-
tion of Welfare Officer unfilled.
Heather Whitney, the sole candi-
date for the post of Womens' Officer,
was unanimously elected. Her inten-
tion to organise self defence classes
for women and to set up specialist
library on women's issues in the
Union office were warmly welcome
by the voters. The post of Transport
Officer was likewise taken up by
Duncan Tindall after a relatively
uneventful speech.
The two ordinary member posi-
tions reserved for freshers were filled
by Lloyd Kilford and Savas George.
In his speech, Lloyd, a maths and
computing student, announced that
he found committee meetings "inter-
esting". He also has plans to convert
the top room in the Queen's Tower
into an observatory, and to raise the
profile of the second hand book shop
in the Physics department.
Meanwhile, the less than luke-
warm enthusiasm of postgraduates to
take a more active role in the running
of Council meant that nobody was
proposed before the start of the meet-
ing. Paul Brown, former Transport
Officer and current head of IC Radio,
eventually "volunteered" for the
position. Confronted with the prob-
lem offindinga partner to take up the
remaining PG post, Paul remained
optimistic, highlighting the large
number of postgraduates currently
involved in the running of clubs and
societies.
With medics from St. Mary's tak-
ing their usual active role in events,
eight candidates stood for the
remaining four ordinary member
positions. These elections saw their
number on the Council increase from
four to six with Sarah Edwards, the
former President of St Mary's
Hospital Medical School Student's
Union, and WD Miles, elected as
ordinary members with the greatest
number of votes. In their absence, for
academic reasons, current president
of Mary's SU, Sami Ansari spoke on
their behalf.
Rob Park's bid for election was
hampered by a suspicion that he had
eaten all the pies during his time on
the Refectory Services Committee.
Hannah Pearson, a third year
Chemical Engineering student, and
Matt Szyndel, a fourth year Physics
student, were however eventually
elected.
Duncan Tindall, John Lambert,
Tom Gallaford and Caroline Deetjen
were elected from the Council to the
Executive Committee of the Union.
Duncan Tindall, the only one of the
candidates to be interrogated, faced a
barrage of questions on how he
would deal with the problems of lack
of space in the BMS building and the
consequential overload on current
facilities.
Three proposed Union policy doc-
uments also saw theirfirstreading at
the Council meeting, with all but one
making it through. A number of
flaws and omissions resulted in the
ICU Publicity Policy being with-
drawn for reworking.
The new Clubs and Societies
Safety Policy, written over the
Summer by Sarah Corneille, faced
even more opposition. Debate
focused on the extensive new condi-
tions placed on off-campus activities.
These include a requirement that
seven days notice must be given to
the Deputy President Clubs and
Societies (DP C&S)'before any trip
can proceed'.
Also debated was the proposed
Disciplinary Policy, which will allow
the Appeals procedure to impose
increased penalties on students.
Council members eventually agreed
unanimously to this measure, as the
Judo session proceeding in the room
above added to the excitement.
