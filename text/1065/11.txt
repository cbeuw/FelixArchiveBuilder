12 LETTERS & NOTICES FELIX FRIDAY 18TH OCTOBER
LETTERS TO FELIX
replied to this week by Jonathan Trout
Mr C replies..,
Dear Mr Baker,
I enjoy reading your column and I
hope it does not upset you too much
if I often agree with it.
You commented that you feel the
JCR is a disgrace, I could add to this
the Walkway Southside Gym ..
indeed the list is too long. We share
an aspiration to provide decent facil-
ities for our students. The new dB's,
where Estates and ICU worked
closely together, is an example of
what can be achieved. The obvious
problem is money, at a time when
Government is cutting back
University funding. The good news
is that we are developing plans to
improve the facilities in Sherfield.
Watch this space!
Kind regards.
Your sincerely

Dear Mr Riley
I would obviously like to comment
on your article in last week's Felix.
Firstly, the safety of staff, students
and the public is of paramount
importance, and secondly, yes I have
spent much of the last week in meet-
ings and on site - much of this has
been related to the construction pro-
jects and reviewing these with Schal.
Your article quite rightly raises
concerns, some of which relate to the
state of the construction industry
itself. The industry has come through
the worst recession I have known and
many firms are indeed financially
weak. Before contractors are
appointed, they are subjected to
financial, quality and health and safe-
ty checks to try to select firms in
which we have confidence. Bank
guarantees and performance bonds
are used where appropriate.
Neither Schal or ourselves are
happy at the number of incidents that
have happened on site. Following the
ceiling collapse I arranged for an
immediate investigation into the rea-
sons behind it. An inspection of the
other new ceilings was also carried
out (which were of a different con-
struction and all quite safe). The
main reason for the collapse was
indeed the supply and use of the
wrong wire for the ceiling ties.
Measures have been put in place as
follows:
• Schal have based a Safety
Manager on site for the next month to
carry out a thorough review of both
the BMS and Libraries project.
• Schal are adding to their team
with a Quality Manager on site.
• I have also commissioned an
independent review from Waterman
Safety Limited whose report is due in
about 2 weeks.
We are therefore doing a consider-
able amount to ensure that quality
control and health and safety man-
agement is as good as can be. In
doing so, we can reassure students
and staff that their health and safety
is a top priority.
Finally I'm not 41!
Yours sincerely

Network corrections
Dear Mr Feakes,
In The Felix of 11th. of October
under the News in Brief heading
there was a section on networking
connections in the Beit Hall in which
you mention the Centre for
Computing Services. Since the sec-
tion showed some contusion as to the
role of the Centre in the networking
of student rooms in Halls of
Residence may I set the record
straight?
The Centre is not responsible for
networking within any of the Halls of
Residence. If rooms are to be wired
up then this must be either funded by
the College or achieved by the
Wardens/College Residences. As
currently defined and funded the
Centre's role is to install a network
connection to the basement of each
building on campus. So far we have
not been funded by the College to do
this for Halls of Residence, but we
have managed to create a student net-
work on the South Kensington cam-
pus linking them, from internal
resources. We have also provided
network hubs for Weekes Hall (a
joint pilot project with the Estates
Division to provide data and tele-
phone outlets in each room) and a
terminal concentrator for each of
Falmouth/Keogh and Selkirk/Tizard
halls. The Union and Felix are on the
network because the Centre put con-
siderable effort and some equipment
into extending the network to the
Beit Quadrangle. It must be said that
the Beit Quadrangle is a particularly
difficult area in which to install net-
work wiring, and I'm sure that any
problems in the Old or New Hostels
are due to this.
Finally the Centre is not empow-
ered to make judgements about the
use students may make of campus
network facilities. That is an academ-
ic issue which is decided by the
College and the departments. When
such decision are made the Centre
takes all reasonable steps to see that
the rules are observed and will report
to the department (or in serious cases
to the College) any students trans-
gressing those rules.
Yours sincerely,
RJHynds

Dear Felix,
Your catalogue of building disasters
here at IC has prompted me to ask
this question: If there is an accident
here at IC, who will be held responsi-
ble, and what action will be taken?
More importantly, will any action be
taken before an accident occurs?

Reports that all students are to
be issued hard hats with their
library cards are as yet uncon-
firmed.
Good clean fun?
Dear Alex,
While there is much in the article
"Humans: 1, Animals: 0 A philoso-
phy by Jonathan Trout" that I accept
and agree with, there are some points
that I take extreme exception to.
I accept that Man is the ultimate
predator, and Man's ability to breed.
rear and kill some lower animals for
food is simply a function of his supe-
rior intelligence. I don't have any
problems with vivisection. Some
major medical advances could not
have been made without it. What I
disagree with is the notion that hunt-
ing animals for sport is "a bloody
good laugh" or that hare-coursing
and badger-gassing are "good, clean
fun". What sort of sick-minded indi-
vidual thinks that an animal in dis-
tress is "good, plain, old-fashioned
hilarious"?
If Mr Trout thinks that visiting
schools with mad cows would have
playgrounds ringing with laughter,
then he has no conception of how
disturbed and frightened children
could be by such a distressing dis-
play.
If Mr Trout considers that club-
bing a blind-folded donkey, or
throwing a goat from a castle parapet
etc, etc, is treating animals "with the
contempt they deserve", then I sug-
gest that he gets to know me by sight
because, should he be foolish enough
to vocalise such ideas within earshot
of me then, with a name like Trout, I
would be sorely tempted to shove a 6
inch, barbed hook through the roof of
his mouth (let's face it, it wouldn't
damage his intelligence), attach a line
to it, and hoist him from one of the
many cranes currently to be found on
campus. Now THAT would be fuck-
ing hilarious!
Mr Trout should remember that
what MOST distinguishes Man from
all the other predators on the planet,
is his predilection with killing his
own kind - for fun!

Dear Sir,
I refer to the "philosophical" article
by Jonathan Trout. I am no animal
rights activist, but I can only feel
sympathy for the writer's warped
state of mind and his runaway
humanistic ego. Honestly, I am sur-
prised that he did not go further to
encourage human cannibalism, since
it is along his line of argument.
He writes "If a cow could corral,
feed and breed me, I would take my
straw hat off to him on the way to the
abattoir. As the hammer swung down
on my thick, hairy, stupid enough to
be caught and branded head I would
marvel at the genius of my slaughter-
