Sadness over
closure of 'excellent'
Montpelier Hall
ANDREW SMITH
College's only dedicated postgradu-
ate Hall of Residence is to close in
September 1997 with the loss of 75
beds. At a time of increasing pressure
on College bed spaces, senior acade-
mics have expressed concern that the
accommodation of postgraduate
freshers may drop in priority.
Montpelier Hall, originally built as
a nurse's hostel for what is now the
Lanesborough Hotel, is suffering
from increasing dilapidation, and
College's Management Planning
Group decided that its closure could
no longer be delayed. The decision
whether to sell or renovate it, with
minimum estimates for the latter
option running at £600,000, will be
taken by MPG before Christmas.
Dr Richard Clarke, warden of
Montpelier, expressed sadness that
what he views as an 'excellent hall'
should be closed. While the sale of
the Knightsbridge property has been
on the cards for some time, Dr Clarke
suggested that the disappearance of
seventy five beds would still be 'a
great loss'.
Despite the small rooms, for which
the hall is notorious, the warden
insisted that the large recreational
area makes Montpelier 'a very socia-
ble place'. Dr Clarke also points to
the fact that it was purpose built as a
hostel, as a reason to keep
Montpelier within the College port-
folio.

The first week of the new term has been a complete success with an enor-
mous response to all the Freshers' events. The Friday night 'Freshers'
Carnival' (scene of the laser show above) was no exception with tickets
being sold out by Thursday lunchtime. This was the first carnival ever to
do so.
Takings at Da Vinci's bar reached record levels with substantial
amounts being spent over the course of the evening. "People arrived ear-
lier and stayed the distance", observed Mark Horne, the Union Events
and Marketing Manager. Southside also had a good night, the bar being
described as 'teeming'. The new dB's ents lounge has been hailed as a
most worthwhile addition to the facilities the Ents crew have to work
with. " A better venue to host better events" commented Mark. "The
capacity of the Union has expanded over the last year and possible plans
to open other areas of the building are in the pipeline." Sarah Ewen

Local residents were shocked and
amazed this week after their pre-
ferred quiet life was shattered by the
casual ballistics of a Southside guest.
A drunken reveller was observed
throwing a full can of beer into one
of the exclusive mews houses behind
Southside.
The can was thrown from the top
floor of Tizard Hall and crashed
through the front room window of a
house in Princes Gate Mews at about
midnight, breaking two panes of
glass and terrifying the resident, who
was present in the room.
The Warden of Tizard Hall,
Dr.John Hassard, spoke of his horror
saying ".. .it could have killed some-
one... a terrible thing to have hap-
pened."
Friday night's occurrence was not
an isolated incident and in the past
some residents have asked for the
windows to be boarded up or netted,
but this would be in breach of fire
regulations and cannot be done. The
resident in question was, as Dr.
Hassard puts it, "incredibly polite
and understanding considering the
circumstances". He is known to have
said "...we were all students once"
