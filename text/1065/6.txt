I Inivcrsity students sometimes run
into difficulties because foi the first
time the work they do, (or don't do),
is determined by minute to minute
decisions as to how they use their
time. The immediate moral con-
straints of the expectations of .one's
family, or of sixth form teachers are
no longer there. There is an enhanced
emphasis on self-motivation.
It sometimes takes a little time to
find a proper balance between the W
demands of work and those of other worr
competing interests, all of which may Bi
well be the normal healthy expires- seen
sion of a full student life. The man- them
agemeni of time, informed by a ficul
recognition that invidious choices even
sometimes have to be made, is a skill coup
that must be acquired if it isn't there colic
already. I am occasionally surprised be d:
