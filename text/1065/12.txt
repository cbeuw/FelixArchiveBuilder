rhetoric, because I will certainly like
to see the writer exuding that same
spirit should the fateful day come.
Surely, getting on his knees to beg
for a quick and painless death is
beneath him.
Assuming that there really exists a
distinct line between humans and
animals, is the ability to feel compas-
sion a distinguishing factor? If that is
so, maybe the writer should be
opposing the persecution of his own
kind.

Dear Sir,
In reply to Jonathan Trout's
"Humans: 1 Animals: 0 " (Issue
1064): and what a neat little mani-
festo it was too. However it all
seemed to hinge on the argument that
more intelligent being, have the right
to exercise their blood lust as they
see fit. Without wishing to be sensa-
tionalist, this kind of argument has
led to genocide in the past and
whereas Mr.Trout may be clear on
where he divides animals and homo
sapiens, other people are not so sure.
As for his claims that animal suf-
fering is "a bloody good laugh",
that's entirely subjective; but I doubt
that the sight of an abbatoir worker
shovelling offal in ten hour shifts
would strike him as anything but sad.
The fact is that the farming practices
of our ancestors bear no relation to
the sick practices carried out today.
"(Humans) build and destroy
because they can conceive of doing
so" is a banal and pointless state-
ment. The fact that humans conceive
discernment and compassion is far
more important.
Yours faithfully,
Mr R Coupland.
Really, I'm disappointed with you
all. Petty personal insults and
death threats are far below the
level of debate I hoped for in writ-
ing this article. Aside from this, I
was most bemused to find that
having written it makes me a can-
nibalistic, genocidal, sick-minded
and warped supremacist. With the
fairly obvious exception of these
three letters, the response has been
overwhelmingly positive to the
piece, it having been seen as a
refreshing change from the usual
"oh poor fluffy bunnies"
approach. Hypocrisy is rife in the
area of animal rights, and it was
my aim to provoke reasoned argu-
ment by taking an admittedly
extreme but thoroughly self-con-
sistent stance.
It also seems to me that I am
being branded as being without
compassion. This is untrue - I do
feel compassion, it is just that I
believe that we should look after
our own race before we start with
others. While there are humans
dying of starvation, or being perse-
cuted for their beliefs I find it con-
temptible that our energies should
be devoted to the welfare of lesser
species. Who has the right to tell us
otherwise?
Finally, I'd like to state that I
believe one of the major criteria
that separates homo sapiens from
the animals is the ability to have a
sense of humour.
No animals were harmed during
the writing of this reply. Except a
few squirrels. Cheers - JT.
The effective library
Dear All,
The Higher Education Funding
Councils, have set up a working
party which produced a report enti-
tled: the Effective Academic Library.
The report recommends a vast range
of measures libraries should take to
assess their effectiveness and econo-
my. One measure requires us to
count the number of users on speci-
fied sample days and the number of
items they consulted during their
visit. The first sample days are
Monday and Thursday, 21 and 2 4
October, followed by 11 and 14
November.
Special notices will be put up in all
the libraries informing users and
telling them what to do (eg reshelv-
ing books or journals they used). I
would be grateful for your under-
standing and co-operation. On all
other days in the libraries, will be
their usual effective selves.

Director of Library Services

MONTPELIER HALL
Another week, another issue, and
one without the recurrent problems
of the first two thankfully. However,
another issue has indeedrisenwith
the condemning of Montpelier Hall,
a decision that seems to have taken
many people by surprise.
Although the Hall has been up for
sale before, and the annoucement
comes some time before the Hall will
close, the problem of meeting the
College commitment to house all
first year students looks even
tougher. To the best of my knowl-
edge, there has been no proposal as
to where to put next year's first year
postgrads. Will the extra entitlement
in the intercollegiate halls be
enough? Will the postgrads be close
enough to South Kenisngton for
them to want to live there?
S A F E T Y HELMETS FOR
ALL?
It would seem that all this talk of
doom and gloom and Biblical style
raining of bit of concrete from the
heavens has worried some newcom-
ers to the college (see D Goodwin's
letter, left).
This is perhaps adding unnecces-
sarily to the burden on Freshers.
They already have had to stand in
more lines and sign more forms than
the mightiest beauracracy could wish
for, and now perhaps they must
queue up again for a little chit to
exchange for a safety helmet.
The campus is coming quite a dan-
gerous place already without more
queues to trip over and the neccessi-
ty for firmer head gear.
TROUT O N THE HOOK
I was happy to see some of the
responses to Jonathon Trout's article
in last week's Felix, particularly
some of the reasoned answers to his
points. I am not sure what petty and
personal insults Jon took from the
replies, but I hope the irony can be
appreciated by all concerned.
This subject is emotive to many
people, and spawns frustration for
those on both side of the debate.
Articles such as Jon's can help to
'break the ice' and perhaps initiate
something more meaningful.
Perhaps contrary to Jon's opinion,
it would seem that Ken Pritchard has
at least a dry wit.
S U C H A NICE M A N
And I mustn't forget to thank the
chap in CCS who kindly sold us a
vital cable even though the shop was
shut. Unfortunately, in the end the
cable had the wrong fitting and we
had to make do withwhat we already
had, but we appreciated the effort.
APOLOGIES
Some of you may have received
Felixes without staples last week.
Our apologies - the collating
machine is, ahem, unreliable.
LASTLY..
My apologies to Mr Nick Dearden
for mixing him up with Mr Ben
Hughes last week.
Don't forget our e-mail address for
letters, felix@ic.ac.uk. This should
make it a lot easier for you to contact
us. Also do take time to have a look
at our new website, which will be
steadily expanded and improved
over the next few weeks. The URL is
http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix. Enjoy!
