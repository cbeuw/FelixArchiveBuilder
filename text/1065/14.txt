ICRFC kicked off their 96-97 season
with a keenly contested encounter
against Queen Mary and Westfield.
The summer's rustiness was evident
in thefirsthalf as QMW opened up a
22-0 lead despite some valiant and
courageous defence by the whole IC
team.
The IC tryline was under constant
pressure, and to the credit of the
whole team, the defence was
breached only three times. Come the
second half the IC machine started to
crank into gear. QMW then found
themselves under the cosh as IC
started to swarm.
Pressure was converted into points
as newcomer prop, Rob Gare, thun-
dered over for the try. The conver-
sion being supplied by returning out-
side half Gareth Williams. Despite
dominating for long periods, further
points were proving elusive to come
by. However, IC played to the end
and as an epic three-minute period of
play resulted in Paul Hardcastle
touching down for the last score of
the match. Result 25-12.
In the day's second game, IC's
2nd XV went down 24-0 against
QMW's 2nds. The third team open
their campaign this weekend, with a
match against St Mary's on
Saturday. All support is welcome.
Warm thanks being extended to
the IC Ladies, who hopefully pitched
up a few pointers for their on and off
the field activities.
This early season setback should-
n't deter IC from success in the near
future. New faces, old hands and an
abundance of skill and class under
the guidance of professional coach
Kevin Bell (Richmond) should weld
this IC team into a formidable unit -
capable of tackling anyone.

Hockey Firsts strike
against Royal Free...
This amazing collection of brilliant
players selected to play - honourably
- for the IC Firsts waltzed all over
Royal Free Hospital. Two hat tricks
(Kabadii and Plasticman) ensured a
glittering performance in only our
second game of this very promising
season. We were playing so well,
that even Johnny Fartpants scored
from 2.4 inches, and that sweeper,
Chicken Boil was in the hunt for
goals. The final result of 8-2 was a
poor reflection on the evident quality
difference.
Pubo boss kept a clear head as
Rent Boy remained exceptionally
calm when converting a slick short-
corner combination. Mr T was solid
as ever as pressure on him increased
during the game. This pressure
(amounting to several kilopascals -
we are scientists after all), finally got
to our ginger goalie Tim, Red
Helmet, conceding two easy goals
late in the game.
Indiana had obviously enjoyed his
Freshers' week too much to be effec-
tive, in fact, he was crap, as was Sid
the Sexist, alias give-me-the-ball-
and-let-me-try-and-dummy-the-
whole-opposition-and-score-myself.
Goldenboy is still refusing to
square any balls, as was Porn-o
refusing to stay wide (Yann got
Fu**ing wide). "This team has the
potential to score on a regular basis."
opined Rent Boy.
,,,as do the Seconds...
IC 2nds continued their winning run
this season with a 2-0 victory over St
Barfholemew Hospital.
As usual the game started like a
house on fire, with fouls aplenty.
Eventually, Rab forced a short cor-
ner, which our captain Goran flicked
into the top corner of the net to the
raucous cheers of the team. An
improvement for goals from short
corners over last season when we got
none. Anyway, lots of attacking play
from both sides followed, but IC was
superior and we held out till half-
time.
The second half started unlike the
first, no fouls but butchery all over
the place. After some Barts' pressure
and near misses, IC strode up the
pitch with ineffable ease and Shaggy
smashed a ball against the keeper's
body.
Some IC pressure followed and a
confusion between the umpires and
the players involved a retaken IC
freehit. Taken it was, played about
with consummate ease before
Richard Brut, who was feeling a
need for young boys, smashed the
ball into the net. More Barts' pres-
sure followed before the end of the
game, but we won, they lost, so roll
on IC Hockey.
.. .and the Thirds
After a tentative start, the 3rds
Animals came roaring into life after
a penalty flick from pudding at 10
minutes.
It was felt by many that the score-
line did not reflect the depth, quality
and general dominance of the ram-
pant IC side, whose stalwart defence
often threatened to overwhelm the
medical opposition.
Clinical passes and impenetrable
defensive work are fast becoming a
hallmark of this promising 3rd's
side, and they can only build on the
sold foundations laid against St
Barts.
