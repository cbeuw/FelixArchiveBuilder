The University of London Union has
at last found a replacement for the
post of Vice-President. The resigna-
tion of the previous incumbent,
Claire Lawrie, at the beginning of
September caused some dismay to
the three remaining sabbaticals, who
have had to take on extra duties
whilst organising the election for her
successor.
Monday's elections, the first
General Union Council of the year,
have ended this period of uncertainty
with Nick Dearden, a Masters stu-
dent from University College
London, being elected to the post.
However, Mr Dearden's election has
not been trouble-free.
It was thought that he might be
barred from standing after giving a
pre-election address to Felix (Felix
1064), a breach of electoral rules.
After the Elections Committee
sought, and found, a precedent in
1992, where the GUC dismissed a
similar allegation, it was decided to
allow Mr Dearden to run. Mr
Dearden's close links with Ms
Lawrie were also questioned, though
the Elections Committee have since
made it clear that it would have only
posed a problem if Ms Lawrie had
actually nominated him.
The only other candidate, Ben
Hughes, decided to withdraw due to
heavy academic committments.
Sarah White, the ULU President,
told Felix that she and the rest of the
ULU staff were "very pleased" with
the result and looking forward to the
year ahead. Ms White will be train-
ing Nick Dearden, who starts on
Monday, in his role as Vice-
President responsible for Finance
and Services, and it is hoped that
ULU will soon be running smoothly.

The tendering process for the new
bookstore, to be situated within the
new library developments, starts
today with the official unveiling of
College invitation for tenders. Just
six organisations are being invited to
bid for the site with College insisting
that money alone will not be the
deciding factor.
Nick Black, College's Estates
Manager, looks forward to the estab-
lishment of 'an academic bookshop
of the highest quality'. Imperial
College Union faces stiff competi-
tion from Blackwells, Waterstones,
Dillons, WH Smiths and Foyles in
the race to provide IC students with
textbooks. Mr Black has confirmed
that when the new shop opens next
Easter, the current ICU bookstore on
the walkway will no longer be
allowed to handle academic books.
The Estates Manager, who took
part in the Rector's Ad-hoc Advisory
Group on the new Bookstore, insists
that College is 'very happy with the
current ICU bookstore', but suggests
that their current location is not ideal.
He maintains that the winning bid
'should be run to the best advantage
of the College community'.
With this in mind ICU President
Eric Allsop argues that all profits of
book sales should be kept within the
College community. He points out
the all revenue from ICU outlets goes
into improving facilities within the
campus. Mr Allsop gives the recent
refurbishment of the Ents Lounge to
become dB's, using Â£40,000 of
bookstore profits, as a prime exam-
ple.
Bids will be received in early
November with the screening and
interview process being conducted
by a panel lead by the Dean of
Imperial College School of Medicine
at The NHLI, Prof Clarke. His group
will include Prof Alan Swanson, Pro-
Rector Educational Quality, Mike
Hansen, Director of Finance, Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates and
Magda Czigany, Director of Library
Services. Prof Swanson will appoint
one student to also sit on the panel.
Universitas 21
KENT YIP
A new international organisation of
super-institutions, known as
"Universitas 21", will be formed
early next year. The idea was initiat-
ed by the University of Melbourne in
Australia, and is scheduled to be in
place by March.
British Universities provisionally
signed up to be members include
Birmingham, Nottingham, Edin-
burgh and Glasgow. The new group-
ing has been described as "a net-
work of universities that share simi-
lar interest" primarily aiming to
exchange information, students, and
share their resources. All members
of the group are from Common-
wealth nations. Moreover, they must
also be research based, multi-disci-
plinary, and have a medical school.
Closer to home, there has been no
move by Imperial College to join
this particular group, though it
already belongs to several interna-
tional organisations. One of these,
"Caesar", co-ordinates all the lead-
ing engineering colleges in Europe
and was previously chaired by Prof
Holmes of the Civil Engineering
Department.
Charing Cross
suicides
Charing Cross Hospital, whose med-
ical school is scheduled to become
part of Imperial College in 1998, is
under investigation after a report in
Time Out exposed a number of
recent suicides. Delays of up to five
hours have been reported in the
admission of patients to the hospi-
tal's casualty department, often lead-
ing to psychriatric patients causing
themselves damage.
One female patient gave up wait-
ing and proceed to take a taxi to
London Bridge where she jumped
off, her body being found ten days
later.
Under the former management,
psychiatric patients were not aban-
doned to wait in casualty. Private
security contractors, introduced in
1992, have been criticised for not
being allowed to help patients in cri-
sis situations such as these.
With three other suicide cases in
the past year, one where a man
jumped from the top floor of the hos-
pital, it has been admitted that a
'tower block is obviously inappro-
priate for psychiatric patients.'
