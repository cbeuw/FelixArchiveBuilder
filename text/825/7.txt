Opinion
View from
The survival of IC as an institution
of excellence is dependent upon its
ability to recruit high standard
students a n d p u m p out higher
standard students into industry and
commerce. The matter of producing
higher standard students is one for
another opinion article but it is a fact
that over the past four years the
average entry grades at IC have
been steadily falling and that the
cost of living i n London is a topic
studiously avoided at all costs
during interviews with prospective
students.
In view of the increase in the cost
of living in London over the past six
years, the changes i n Government
policy towards education which
have already cost the average
London student approximately £200
more a year and the reducing value
of the grant i n real terms, which is
only worth 85% of what it was six
years ago, it is the opinion of the
author that student finances will
become the predominent factor i n
student recruitment i n the future.
The following set of figures aim to
demonstrate that Imperial is i n a
very poor position to attract
students o n grounds of financial
benefit.

The difference i n the cost of living is around £1,000 per year. However
a London student may benefit from an extra £350 grant and is eligible for
approximately £400 (on average) more housing benefit than a student i n
a provincial university. This means London students pay an extra £250 per
year to be educated.
Neither group will gain housing benefit under the new student loans
scheme and hence the Extra Cost of a London Education (ECLE) will jump
from around £250 to £650 per year. The Government aims to freeze the
grant through the loans scheme; the effect of inflation o n the larger costs
in London will mean that, at present rates, the E C L E will increase by £65
per year until such a time as the Government deems it appropriate to re-
assess the grant.
A further matter that is not taken
into account i n the above figures is
that of entertainment. This is not
something which interests the
Government; as i n their eyes,
students should not be spending
money on being entertained. It is,
though, a matter that should
concern the College.
Students entering colleges such as
IC have worked hard and long to get
their grades and wish to learn a little
more about life than can be read i n
a book. They will spend money o n
entertainment a n d will broaden
their education in doing so; the cost
of this will influence their choice of
university or college.
London may have the widest
range of entertainment i n the
country but it is also the most
expensive i n the country. A trip to
the cinema i n London will cost
nearly double what it would at a
provincial university; a pint of beer
is one-and-a-quarter to one-and-a-
half times the cost of the same beer
in the North of England; a theatre
trip is generally too expensive to
consider.
London students are often unable
to afford the entertainments that
students at other universities enjoy.
Worse still, having worked hard at
school and not enjoyed this time as
much as they might have done, they
find that even their peers who are in
low paid jobs can afford to spend
much more o n entertainment.
Should the price for becoming
educated a n d i m p r o v i n g the
country's prospects be three years
solitary confinement during the
prime of your life? The way things
look, it could be this way for many
students at I C unless they are
willing to accept an even larger
overdraft.
A s potential students become
aware of the effect that London will
have upon their social life and/or
their pockets recruitment figures at
IC will fall. £1000 a year is an
incomprehensibly large figure for a
17 year-old who is trying to decide
which university to go to.
I see the College as having a series
of options. If IC is to stay in London
we must look at adapting the
College to make us more attractive
to potential students; we cannot
reduce the costs of London, but we
can try and make life here better
value for money.
Suggestions
1. Cut timetabled hours, saving
costs and releasing staff time for
other activities, releasing student
time for greater appreciation of
London and enjoyment of cheap
Union-based entertainment or to
take u p part-time jobs to
supplement their income.
2. Re-direct staff time towards
greater research to increase the
academic reputation of the College.
3. Research into graduation salaries
for students from department to
department and compare with other
colleges. If salaries and employment
rates for graduates are not high, the
College should do something about
them as they are crucial if we are to
recruit students.
4. Coordinate an informed a n d
honest recruitment drive from each
department, with emphasis o n
those coming from families w h o are
able to afford to support their
students, sponsored students and
those w h o are very dedicated.
5. Invest time i n the gradual
development of Alumnus links with
the department by providing a n
enjoyable a n d more relaxed
environment for work. Ex-student
support i n the areas of recruitment,
employment or sponsorship will not
be forthcoming if they do not enjoy
their time here, or if they are
forgotten for twenty years and then
called back to a dinner with people
they never knew and at this point
squeezed for a quick buck.
6. Invest money i n the Careers
Service, as this is vital to the future
of the College. Prepare the service
for a heavy demand for vocational
jobs.
7. Help the Students' Union to
negotiate student deals w i t h
industry a n d commerce to help
student funds.
8. Reorganise many of the jobs i n
College so that they can be done by
a series of students as part-time
labour.
9. T u r n the College into a
sponsorship based college. The idea
is that students will only be accepted
onto courses if they are sponsored.
The departments would have to
spend a considerable amount of
time negotiating mass sponsorship
deals with industry to try and corner
an even larger section of the market.
The effects of this would be:
a) Students at IC would be able to
afford to live i n London and would
probably have vacation jobs to
supplement their income.
b) Students that came would have
to be completely sure of what they
wish to do i n life and sure that it
coincided with what their sponsors
wanted.
c) It is likely that much of R C S and
R S M will cease to exist, due to a
difficulty i n finding sponsorship,
leaving ' I m p e r i a l College of
Engineering and Medicine'.
d) Courses would be heavily
affected b y industrial a n d
commercial demands and as a result
academic f r e e d o m w o u l d be
severely damaged.
e) It is likely that companies
