Feature
Space Invaders
O n Saturday Feburary 4, the
Science Fiction Society will be
holding its one day Convention,
PicoCon, i n the Union Building.
W h a t is a Science F i c t i o n
Convention, and w h y do people
want to talk about SF for the whole
day?
A n SF Convention (or to use the
standard abbreviations, an SF Con),
is a collection of SF related events
that takes place over a day, or
weekend (PicoCon is a one day
affair), where guests come and talk,
films are shown with the general
idea of having an enjoyable SF
related time. The actual events in
general cover a very broad range. A t
the last World SF C o n held in the
U K (the 1987 WorldCon, called
Conspiracy, Brighton), the talks
r a n g e d f r o m discussions of
particular a u t h o r s ' w o r k ,
conversations between authors and
scientists about how likely their
predictions were, talks on how to
write SF and, more importantly,
how to get published and much
much more. Over five days there
were twelve hours of talks each day
in five separate streams (that's 60
hours a day) and that doesn't
include the video and film shows.
Ken Livingston even gave a talk on
possible future politics!
Of course one area that always
fascinates SF fans is that of space
travel, and many SF writers are in
fact scientists of one form or
another. Dave Brin, w h o talks to
ICSF last year, is a cometry
physicist, and the famed Carl Sagan
has written science fiction (whether
that includes the Cosmos series is
another matter). The process also
works the other way; Arthur C
Clarke is credited for inventing the
idea of the geostationary
communications satellite. Science
fiction, i n fact, inspires many people
to go into scientific careers, as I'm
sure is true for many IC students.
There is also a very strong vein of
anarchic humour that permeates the
SF fan world, perhaps due to all the
strange and conflicting fureres they
read about, and there are usually
some very o d d things happening at
conventions. A t the recent Oxford
C o n , C o n i n e , there was a
performance of Fundament a thirty
minute opera based o n Isaac
Asimov's Foundation saga (not just
the first three books but all five!), i
The one thing about conventions
that you can expect is that the
unexpected will happen. This
unfortunately sometimes applies to
the guests as well. A t last year's
University Convention (UniCon) in
Winchester, the guest of honour,
Patrick Tilley, left a couple of hours
after he arrived, leaving only a short
note and a pair of bootlaces.
Somehow I doubt he'll ever be
asked to a convention again.
What are SF fans like? Strangely
e n o u g h , a n d against all the
suggestions the media will give you,
they are completely ordinary
people. They do not dress up like
Dr W h o (we leave that to the
'Whovians' and the less said about
them the better), make beep beep
noises or try to beam up to the
Enterprise. However, they are likely
to be more interested and aware of
science than most people, and
perhaps that is why Imperial has so
many SF fans. They are also
perhaps a little more aware of the
long term implications of scientific
and technological advances, since
many have been considered by
science fiction writers, and that
cannot be a bad thing for anybody.
In general SF fans are ail very
friendly and only too willing to talk
to others who show an interest in
SF.
A n d what can you expect from
Picocon? Some of the guests are
detailed in this article, and there's
a provisional timetable as well.
A m o n g some of the other activities
going on. the Amateur Rocketry
Group needs some explanation.
Since model powered rockets can
now be imported, a group of SF fans
have got together to sell them and
will be giving a talk on how to build,
fly, retrieve them, and, most
importantly, how not to kill yourself
with the things. There will also be
SF w a r g a m i n g all day, w i t h
Paranoia (apt description) game and
a Space: 1889 scenario (that's the
new one about the Victorian space
explorers). W e ' v e got a full
programme of films and television
SF, and there will be many other
things happening that we haven't
planned for, as is usual for a
Convention. Hope to see you all at
Picocon next Saturday.
prolific British SF writers. He's
written a vast number of books,
ranging from the near future (eg
Ground Zero Man) to the far future
(Orbitsville series) and most recently
to an isolated double world system
where baloons can act as spacecraft
(The Ragged Astronauts and The
Wooden Spaceships). He is renowned
among SF fans for his frequent
'Serious Scientific' talks (which are
neither), packing halls at WorldCon
and N o v a C o n whenever he gives
one.
last year's Picocon and was so
popular that we asked h i m back.
Dave Langford
Dave is a reformed Nuclear Scientist
(see The Leaky Establishment for what
is definitely not the story of his
nuclear career!), who now makes a
living as an SF writer and fan, and
is an almost permanent fixture at all
U K SF Cons. His manic talks are
very well worth attending. His most
recent book, Dragon Hiker's Guide to
Battlefield Covenant Beyond Dune's
Edge Odessy 2 is a salutary lesson and
threat to anyone who ever thought
about writing a sequel.
Terry Pratchett
Terry is unusual among British SF
writers in dominating the Times
Bestseller list with one of his books.
This was Mort the latest i n his
expanding series of DiscWorld
books, which are doing for Fantasy
what The Hitch Hikers Guide did for
science fiction. Terry was a guest at
Dave Lally
Dave runs the fan club for that most
enigmatic television series The
Prisoner, and promises to be giving
us a run d o w n on the real spying
background of one of its devisers.
He'll also say something about the
programme's conception, and
perhaps might actually say
something about what it was meant
to be about.
Bob Shaw
Bob is one of the best and most Running Cons does this to you
