THE . cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Council votes to make itself supreme body
Farewell to democracy?
Following a heated debate
Monday night's Union Council
voted to abolish Union General
Meetings (UGM's) by a two thirds
majority. The motion, which
constitutes a change in Union by-
laws, will now be put to the U G M
on Tuesday and it will have to be
passed by a second U G M before it
can be taken to the Governing Body
for approval. If passed the move
will leave Council as the supreme
Union decision making body.
Under the the terms of the
motion, students will be able to
mandate C o u n c i l members to
submit motions to Council provided
they have 25 seconders. Ordinary
Students will be free to attend
Council Meetings, but they will not
have voting rights and will have
speaking rights only at the Council's
discretion. The Hustings U G M for
Sabbatical candidates w i l l be
replaced by an elections meeting,
but students will still be able to call
Emergency General Meetings if they
collect 150 seconders.
The motion was submitted to
Council by the unofficial working
party set u p to investigate the
merger between IC Student's Union
and St Mary's student's Union. The
working party argued that the
present U G M system is
unrepresentative because students
from St Mary's are unable to attend
U G M ' s on the IC site. They say that
the only viable solution to this
problem is to abolish U G M ' s leaving
Council as the supreme decision
making body.
The working party, which has met
regularly since the start of the
academic year consists of 5
representatives from IC Union and
5 from St M a r y ' s . The party
discussed the U G M at a meeting on
December 19, for 2 hours, according
to St M a r y ' s U n i o n Secretary
Graham Price. M r Price told FELIX,
'We've been i n student politics a
long time and we went away and
discussed the matter for a week
before Christmas until two weeks
afterwards. Council at IC would
have a lot more student scrutiny'
Union Deputy President Chas
Brereton, a member of the working
party, said that the party h a d
rejected the proposal that motions
should be submitted through the
Consituent College Union (CCU)
U G M ' s because this would create
difficulties if motions were to be
a m m e n d e d . H e a d d e d that
alternating the U G M ' s between St
Mary's a n d I C would also be
impractical.
Speaking on behalf of a group of
students in opposition to the move,
Postgraduate Affairs Officer, Dave
Clements outlined his concerns that
the new system would make it
difficult for students to make their
voices heard. He.was particularly
concerned that the move would
allow Union Officers to make
'decisions behind closed doors'
without being accountable to the
students who elected them.
'I am disgusted. It is wrong.' he
said, 'The name Students' Union
implies that it is an organisation run
by students for students. The
removal of U G M ' s is a hacks charter
and would lead to a union run by
hacks.'
Mr Clements went on to say that
the poor attendance at U G M ' s this
year was the result of poor publicity
by the Union and expressed concern
that motions submitted by minority
groups would not interest Council
and would not be given a fair
hearing. He added that petitions in
support of retaining U G M ' s are
available for signing in the FELIX
office or Imperial College Radio.
Union President Nigel Baker
admitted that it would 'take up too
much time to open Council to
everyone' and that speaking rights
might be a problem when Council
was short of time. H e went on to
suggest that Union Officers would
be 'a hell of a lot more accountable'
to students through links with
Departmental and Accademic Reps.
Deputy President, Chas Brereton
told F E L I X 'If someone h a s
something sensible to say I would
have no hesitation i n granting
speaking rights, but I cannot answer
for the rest of Council.'
When questioned about publicity
for U G M ' s M r Brereton told FELIX
'er what can we say? The walkway
has been spattered in posters. Exec
News could be produced but that
remit falls to the H o n Sec. There is
a limit to what you can do.'
