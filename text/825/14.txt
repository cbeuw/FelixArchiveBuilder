The Woman in
Black
"The combination of the peculiar,
isolated place and the sudden
appearance of the woman and the
dreadfulness of her expression
began to fill me with fear. Indeed,
I had never i n m y life been so
possessed by it, never k n o w n my
knees to tremble and my flesh to
creep, and then to turn cold as
stone, never k n o w n my heart to
give a great lurch, as if it would
almost leap up into my dry mouth
and then begin pounding my chest
like a hammer on an anvil, never
known myself gripped and held fast
by such dread and horror and
apprehension of evil...'
... .and I was merely the audience.
'It was as though I had become
paralysed. I could not bear to stay
there, for fear, but nor had I any
strength left i n my body to turn and
run away, and I was as certain as I
had ever been of anything that, at
any second, I would drop dead on
that wretched patch of ground.'
....well, seat 27 row M to be
precise. Call me susceptible if you
like but The Woman in Black (of which
the above is an extract) is a ghost
story of the chilliest and most
spinetingling order.
'Twas a dark and stormy night
when I battled against the elements
and District Line commuters to get
to the first preview of this new play:
Stephen Mallarat's adaptation of the
Susan Hill book. The essence of the
spooky tale is introduced to the
audience by means of the
protagonist hauntingly recounting
his story to an actor w h o m he has
engaged to help h i m present the tale
of events to a small audience of
family and friends. The motive?
Apparently to explain an (as yet
unarticulated) recent family tragedy.
With half an eye for potential theatre
managers, the actor sets about
transforming the pedestrian and
overlong monologue into a two-
hander play, heavily relying upon
the wonders of 'recorded sound'
and the imagination of the audience.
For instance, a wicker hamper, first
a desk then railway carriage seat, is
p u l l e d centre-stage; our hero
gingerly climbs aboard and, to the
accompaniment of m u c h hoof-
clumping and jigging up and down,
the 'pony and trap' draws away.
By this device the ground work is
l a i d m e t i c u l o u s l y , if slightly
labouriously, but as the two
rehearse together scenes lengthen
and the incidence of fatuous
references to H e n r y I r v i n g
decreases. The lighting becomes
Cocktail
Hollywood likes to go through
fashions and phases, if a film of a
certain genre is successful then
other directors and producers try to
cash in by grabbing on to its coat
tails. This is what gave us the
outbreak of Vietnam movies, a spate
of baby movies and now we have a
series of bar movies that includes
Ironweed, Barfly and now Cocktail.
But as the first two are mainly about
seedy alcoholics in the last stages of
destroying their livers, Cocktail is set
in N e w York's Upper East Side, a
land of fast money and fast sex. Tom
Cruise is ambitious, he gets plenty
of the the latter but wants plenty of
the former as well, so he works as
a barman to pay his way through
college. But here barmen are sought
after performers. They throw the ice
in the air and catch it in glasses held
behind their backs while pouring
three drinks simultaneously and at
the same time deciding which of the
beautiful customers they are going
to screw that night. M r Cruise is the
best of the best in this game. He
works with his bar,-room mentor
played by Australian Bryan Brown
who spouts bar-room philosophy
while trying to get married to
somebody (anybody) that is young,
attractive and above all, rich. In the
end he manages to do this and uses
his w i f e ' s m o n e y to o p e n
Manhattan's most exclusive and
trendy watering holes. H e finds
success and money aren't all he
thought they were. Meanwhile, M r
Cruise finds true love, accidentally
gets true love pregnant and loses
true love. W h e n his friend kills
himself M r Cruise is inspired to get
true love back again, for a nice
happy ending.
Basically, this film is little more
than another Hollywood crowd
puller. Y o u can lie back and for one
hundred minutes or so the film
washes over you. Absolutely no
strenuous thinking at all is required
from the audience. Technically the
acting and directing is reasonable
but as a whole the film simply does
not hold together.

'Sorry, the 6X is off.'
more dramatic as the emphasis
shifts from the telling of the story to
the events themselves, characters
and audience now fully absorbed.
Finally comes the watershed: A
massive e x p a n s i o n of scale,
emotionally, dramatically and
technically. A staircase, landing and
nursery are now differentially
illuminated to great effect. A dull,
repetitive creaking is heard
overhead. Through shimmering
curtains we see our hero i n
silhouette, step by deliberate step
slowly ascending the stairs. Screams
and apparitions; explanations and,
of course, the twist i n the tale...
.. .But for that you will have to go
and see for yourself. I recommend
this play unreservedly, and not just
because it provides the perfect
excuse to grab hold of the arm of yor
(carefully selected) companion. John
Duttine and Charles Kay gave
c o m p e l l i n g performances
c o m p l e m e n t e d by a superb
production. This is one not to be
missed.
The Woman in Black is on at the
Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith until
February 11. Tickets £10, £8, £6 £5
and concessions available.
