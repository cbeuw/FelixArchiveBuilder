course in the beginning of February.
The cost of the course is £70 which
includes 8-10 hours instruction by
B r i t i s h Parachute A s s o c i a t i o n

are £12, approximately £4 of which
w i l l be r e f u n d e d b y u s o n
production of a reciept.
The training will take place on the
evenings of February 7 a n d 9
(Tuesday and Thursday). This will
then be completed o n the Saturday
at Headcorn Parachute Club (near
Ashford) and, weather permitting,
you will also do your first parachute
jump.

w e e k l y M o n d a y meetings at
12.30pm i n the Union Dining Hall
(first floor of the Union Building).
You will be required to pay a £20
deposit to secure your place o n the
course and £4 Club membership.
If y o u are still unsure please feel
free to come to the meetings and
have a chat w i t h one of the
Committee.
I.C.C.A.G.
I C C A G — I s there life after College?
Whilst at College it is all too easy to
believe that these Ivory Towers are
all that matters for the next three or
four years and i n so doing ignore
the existence of a far larger
community which is all around us
and has had to tolerate the presence
of five thousand or more Imperial
students every year.
I C C A G is part of a national
network of College Community
A c t i o n G r o u p s . T h e w o r d s
Community Action d o not mean
that we are all out to change the
world but it does mean that we are
a part of a group of over 15,000
students w h o are involved i n the
community i n which we live and
study through many different kinds
of voluntary work.
We now have a new constitution
which should make it easier for us
to publicise and organise links with
the local community. But whilst we
can put as many posters and write
as many articles as we like about
v o l u n t a r y w o r k .such as the
Playgroup which we are involved
with, the Soup R u n and other
activities, it is all wasted unless
people are prepared to look outside
College and see what else is going
on.
There will be a meeting next
Monday (23rd) at 12.45pm i n the
ICCAG/Rag Office which is on the
top floor of the Union Building. So
if y o u are interested then come
along or if you can't make it then get
in touch with us through the Soup
Run or the I C C A G pigeonhole i n
the Union Office.
WELLSOC
Illegible
Wellsoc have done negotiation with
the managers of Skirmish to offer
his game again at 75% discount (ie
£5). most of this is illegible—TS.
SNOOKER
The Snooker Club is proud to
present the 1989 doubles
competition. We've refused Steve
Davis's entry to leave more places
free in the draw. There'll be a trophy
and cash prizes (amounts depend
on number of entrants). So come up
to the Club (top floor, Beit) before
February 1 to put your name where
Steve Davis's is not allowed to put
his. Entrance is £4 per pair.
CONSOC
Centre-right politics is still alive at
IC despite the current rantings
about student loans. Imperial
College Conservative Society is still
very active and has five speaker
meetings scheduled for the rest of
this term. Notably we have Douglas
H u r d , the Home Secretary, visiting
on February 7. The Society supports
the Government's plans for student
loans and we believe the majority of
IC students couldn't really care less.
We should not think that the current
leftish rabble is representative of
more than a handful of hacks.
Our contribution to the argument
will be a speaker meeting o n
•February 14 by Angela Rumbold,
Minister of State for Education and
Ken Baker's deputy. M s Rumbold
will put the Government's case on
loans and we hope many people will
come and listen to the expert.
FOOTBALL SKI RACING
Wham!
Royal Free—1
IC II—2
IC's successful season continued
with another fine w i n against R F H
on a very heavy pitch. Unable to
play their normal fast flowing
football, IC worked hard to secure
two points in their title challenge. It
could have been a different story
had R F H scored a one on one after
ten minutes, but a brave save from
Webster Nonde kept IC on course.
It wasn't long before the dead lock
was broken when G u y Phiri beat
two defenders and squared the ball
for A d a m Thomas to pass the ball
to the net, just like Jimmy Greaves
showed h i m i n the week. A good
first half performance w a s
consolidated w h e n M i c k e y
Plummer dribbled through most of
the R F H team before firing home for
twenty yards. Mickey a n d E d
Coates then both hit the bar and the
keeper made good saves from G u y
Phiri and Russ Dark as IC piled on
the pressure. But close to the end,
a mix u p i n IC's defence allowed
R F H to get a consilation goal, and
an equaliser may have ensued but
for resolute defending from Captain
Jezz Holland and Ivan Parkin.
IC (lsts)-l
Goldsmiths—0
A mere 2,500, IC's lowest home gate
of the season, turned out on this
dismal Saturday afternoon to see the
'Blues' register another crucial
c h a m p i o n s h i p victory against
defending champions, Goldsmith's
Collge.
The muddy conditions made IC's
normally fluent passing game
somewhat difficult to play but it was
a typical piece of one-touch football
that brought the winner midway
through the first half. A series of
delightful passes released Pip Peel
on the left and his pin-point cross
was beautifully chested down by
Paul Olden who calmly slipped past
a defender before jabbing h i m his
second goal i n successive games.
The rest of the game was a tale of
crunching tackles and I C attacks
frustrated more by the elements
than b y g o o d d e f e n d i n g .
Goldsmiths came back into the
match as IC legs began to tire i n the
last fifteen minutes but Messrs
Ewart, Hattersley, Fisher, a n d
Burton showed w h y IC have the
best defensive record in the league,
keeping them comfortably at bay;
indeed Paul Olden nearly added a
second a second late on when he
powered a head just wide.
IC now lead the Premier Division
by three points left to play.
Last Sunday night the Superbowl
was not the only major sporting
event occurring. Three teams from
IC Ski Club were battling it out i n
freezing conditions at Brentwood
dry slope i n the third race of the
season. The biggest problem of the
evening turned out to be the ski
bindings which were set at a
ridiculously low setting, so skis
tended to come off spontaneously,
resulting i n a lot of falls. Despite
this, the 1st team survived the first
round unbeaten, and the 2nd and
3rd teams lost only one race each,
due to the dubious placings system
used by the organisers, the 2nd and
3rd teams could not subsequently
come higher than 7th, so they did
very well to come 7th and 8th
respectively after a thrilling race
between themselves. A n n a
performed some more ballet i n the
second round, injuring herself in the
process, and forcing a re-run of the
entire r o u n d . I n the r e - r u n
everybody got it right, qualifying us
for the final against R H B N C 1st,
which we w o n by 2 gates.
Thanks to Anna, Emma, Derek,
Clive, Chris, Patrick, Stefan, G u y ,
Paul, Danny, Jack, the two others
whose names I've forgotten, a n d
especially 'the fan club'.
Next race o n Saturday Feb 25 at
Hemel Hempstead (sign up on 23rd
please).
HOCKEY
IC 3rds—6
Meadhurst (BP)—0
After a defeat o n Wednesday the
3rd again produced a very fine all
round performance for a resounding
victory o n a very wet pitch due to
some far from fine weather.
A quiet day in goal for A n d y still
saw h i m give the opposition there
best chance to score when he gave
away a penalty flick, but he
redeemed himself producing a good
save. Gary (a renegade from some
totally u n - c r e d i t w o r t h y team)
playing in his first game after injury
had an important role at centre-half
setting u p lots of play for the
forwards.
Several good crosses supplied by
Vijay enabled Kaleem to a d d two
more to his tally for the year, and
despite his inability to convert short
corners, Steven managed to score
another hat trick. The game didn't
go all IC's way with the home side
quick on the break and despite stout
defence, especially from Eric, they
were unlucky not to score, with a
saved penalty and a disallowed
short corner. Somewhere amongst
all this Kevin brought the total to six
with a 'delicate' 'placed' shot.
