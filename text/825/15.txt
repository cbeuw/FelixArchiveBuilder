Someone to
Love
ICA, from Jan 20
'This is a movie isn't it?' asks Orson
Welles, approaching the end of
Someone to Love.
Henry Jaglom's (writer, director,
main actor) previous film Always
told the story of his o w n divorce,
and starred himself and his ex-wife,
shot in the home they lived in before
separating. Small wonder, then,
that this new product seems barely
shifted from reality, a n unusual
hybrid of cinema and documentary,
with a touch of home movie style
even (barring the competent camera
work and superb editing, the latter
Jaglom's forte).
Jaglom plays film director Danny,
puzzled by the fact that none of his
friends seem to be i n permanent
relationships. Plus his girlfriend
won't let h i m sleep overnight in her
bed, her o w n space. Danny's
sensible, property aquiring elder
brother, Michael, has acquired a
lovely old theatre in Santa Monica,
and sold it, shortly to be turned into
a s h o p p i n g centre. Naturally,
Danny invites all his 'lonely heart'
friends to the theatre on Valentine's
Day, pulls along a camera crew, and
films, rapping out ' W h y are you
alone?' to all and sundry.
The film is shot through with
emotive, ironic and often funny
observations by a splendid range of
characters, a l l believable as
individuals, and nicely rounded off
by the slightly cynical Michael, a bit
suspicious of ' a l l these actors,
artists...that kind of thing.' A s the
party progresses everyone eats,
drinks, talks, and has their say into
a camera.
This part of the film has been
lovingly crafted to blend formal with
casual protography, cutting off
camera exchanges (private scenes
over lunch, and i n the ladies room)
w i t h D a n n y ' s free-for-all talk
exchange in the main theatre hall.
Even a reluctant cameraman is
pulled to face the camera to consider
his partner-less state.
Presiding over, or rather behind
events is Orson Welles. In this, his
last screen performance, Welles is
lifted almost entirely out of context
and given an unmoving, magisterial
position seated in the back row of
the theatre. 'I'm speaking from the
cheap seats, not Mount Sinai' he
barks, necessarily reminding on and
off screen mentor Jaglom not to take
his w o r d as l a w . Welles is
commentator, the supreme

Douglas Adams
Many moons ago the British radio
comedy scene was shattered by a
revolutionary new series. Where The
Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy broke
new ground was in its humour as
much as anywhere. It had some.
After bleeding the characters,
plots and universe in general dry,
with three good books and a lousy
one, Douglas Adams has begun a
new collection. It seems that he
wants to be remembered as 'that
man' who wrote some funny stuff
once for the wireless by not writing
anything else amusing.
It is almost impossible to describe
this latest book without reference to
its predecessor Dirk Gentry's Holistic
Detective Agency which sat i n the
best-seller lists for the whole of last
year. W h y either one could be a
observer, throwing out the funniest,
and most profound lines in the film
concerning the feminist revolution,
population explosion, decline of the
communist state of the movie and
more. This, apart from the ideas and
humour, is a priveledged glimpse
into the 15-year friendship between
Jaglom and Welles: Welles giving
Jaglom insight, and relishing the
success, b e y o n d the author's
reputation, I cannot fathom.
Gently is a sleuth with some
interest in Physics, and attempts to
prove the fundamental intercon-
nectedness of all things. This he
quite resoundingly fails to achieve.
Furthermore he has become the
main character of the second tale,
revealing just how incompletely he
approaches everything, but more
importantly losing all the mystery
which kept me reading the first
book when the story escaped me.
While the plot is just about
decipherable this time, the
descriptive passages a n d
observational style maintain Adams'
unique manner, and the book is
largely unoffensive, it is not funny
or compelling or even thick and
chunky and nice to hold. I only read
it to the end to find out just what
the eagle and Coca-Cola vending
machine had to do with everything.
The answer to that can be found on
page 242.

repartee involved. The film ends
with Welles shouting 'cut!' as
Danny's movie has run its course,
and a marvellous image of a deep
rumble-bellied laugh, with a glint in
the eye that will refuse to die.

emotional truth' exclaims Yelena—

Reviews
Impressionists
U n d e r the u m b r e l l a of
Impressionism in the 1870s and '80s,
it would be hard to find two more
disparate talents than those of
Claude Monet and Pual Gauguin.
M o n e t , t h e master, w h o s e
'Impression: Sunrise' gave the
movement its name, enjoyed critical
and financial recognition for his
artistic strength and originality. His
work is a celebration of light, never
twice interpreting t h e subtle
interplay of light and shadow i n
quite the same way. By applying
small, separate daubs of colour,
each object i n his work 'loses its
local identity' and vibrates to give
an impression of the whole.
In total contrast, both i n art and
outlook was Paul Gauguin. The
man whose rebellious attempts at
e m a n c i p a t i o n f r o m E u r o p e a n
discipline ended in abject poverty in
the South Seas, broke from the
Impressionist style at the early
stage. A t variance with Impres-
sionist practice, he used strong, flat
colour with forms often rimmed
with contour lines. Simplifying his
palette, he adopted a vivid re-
interpretation of colour rather than
a naturalist reproduction. "That
shadow is rather blue, so paint it
with pure ultramarine. Those leaves
are red? Put o n pure vermillion.'
These two hard-backed volumes
from part of "The Impressionists'
series, published by Cassell. They
are exquisitely produced to a glossy
96-page formula, perfect for the
esoteric coffee table, and have the
virtue of being reasonably priced.
Both texts are very interesting,
considering his rebellious attitudes,
escapist travels, a n d attempted
murder with a cut-throat razor by
Van Gogh, however unsalaciously
described. These are beautiful
books, of the sort that it is very
pleasant to leaf t h r o u g h i n
bookshops, and think of an excuse
to yourself for buying.

accomplished is a n entertaining

Welles a n d skillful editing a l l

documentary as you're likely to
find.
