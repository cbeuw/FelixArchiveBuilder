Opinion
interested i n sponsoring a student
will not be interested i n extra-
curricular activities as they are not
looking for a broadened character
but a character specialised i n the
particular vein that will suit them.
The result will be a dramatic
reduction i n the activities of the
Students' Union, an increase (if
possible) is timetabled hours and the
loss of a m i n d - b r o a d e n i n g
education.
10. Get out of London completely.
This would enable IC to continue to
run i n exactly the same w a y . It
w o u l d u n d o u b t e d l y cost a
considerable sum as the College is
not allowed to sell the London site
off to a non-academic tenure
without Royal consent.
11. Relocate part of the College
activities on the outskirts of London.
This is what is being proposed by
the merger with Royal Holloway &
Bedford N e w College (RHBNC).
The proposal at the moment would
appear to suggest a split site
institution under the name Imperial
College with research and major
laboratory work based at IC and
teaching facilities based at R H B N C .
This w o u l d mean that only
research a n d third/fourth year
students need to be based at the
South Kensington site. This is
around 2,500 students from IC plus
around 500 students from R H B N C .
Of these, the College could house
around 2,000 students at the present
rents .By selling off some of the
mortgaged property, the rent might
be reduced to an average of £30 per
week. This w o u l d save the average
student at the South Kensington
campus around £200 per year. It
should be noted that many of the
students w o u l d be postgraduate
research students w h o would be
better located out of London as they
are not free i n the summer to take
up jobs a n d supplement their
income or to get out of London to
reduce their costs. The situation o n
the IC campus w o u l d still be one of
high expense and the housing
p r o b l e m , a l t h o u g h i m p r o v e d ,
w o u l d not be solved.
Other effects of the merger would
include:
a) Large transport costs for
students and staff w h o need to use
facilities o n the other campus, eg
postgraduate demonstrators,
lecturers and students requiring
laboratory space.
b) The cost of living i n Egham, the
location of R H B N C , may be less
than South Kensington, but the
difference is not all that significant.
It is rumoured that the University
Funding Council will support the
merger b y funding extra student
a c c o m m o d a t i o n i n E g h a m . If
sufficient money is put i n this could
be of considerable benefit to
students at Egham.
c) The distance between campuses
w o u l d doubtlessly result i n
uneconomic use of staff and student
time. Timetabling problems would
be immense and it may become
apparent that to overcome the time
lost i n travel it is necessary to
timetable more activities at one time
that there is space available for. This
would mean extra cost i n creating
more space t h r o u g h b u i l d i n g
programmes.
d) The effect o n the Students'
Union could be disastrous. The
Egham site would doubtlessly have
a lively social atmosphere, but the
South K e n site would deteriorate
into a hive of academia and very
little else.
Clubs and societies will find i f
extremely difficult to operate under
this situation. O n e society cannot
operate from two campuses that are
so far apart. If two societies were to
operate from the different sites it
would be far worse than at present
as the experienced people, capable
of r u n n i n g the societies a n d
teaching new-comers, will be at
South K e n and all the new-comers
will be i n Egham.
The effect of Arts students upon
the politics of the Union will mean
the moderate and apolitical nature
of I C will be destroyed. Art's
students will dominate student
affairs i n the new college. This is
likely to mean that IC will become
just another college of ranting
politicians w h o miss the most
important topic: the needs of the
students.
e) A n i m p r o v e m e n t i n the
character of the College will be
unavoidable, as the presence of Arts
students and an improved sex ratio
will lead to the establishment of a
more balanced community. This
may improve recruitment i n the
future.
12. The College, or possibly the
University of London, could oppose
the proposed, student loans system
on the grounds of unworkability
and the likely to effect o n Higher
Education i n London. This would
only be a short term solution unless
the College was willing to fight for
a more realistic London grant at the
same time.
I do not like the thought of any of
the above, but favour a well thought
out, united and careful approach to
the last point. I fear that an ill-
i n f o r m e d U n i v e r s i t y F u n d i n g
Council has already decided that
money can be saved by merging IC
and R H B N C and that we will find
it difficult to stop this merger now
I also feel that the R H B N C merger
has not been at all well thought out
and will be considerably less
efficient than two independent
colleges. I would be interested to
hear the College Secretary's views
on the matter.
Tell me what the
fuck is going on?
'Request for information!' screamed
Steph Snell. 'Will somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on?' This was
one of the many insane comments
made o n Monday night at Imperial
College Union's longest running
farce - C o u n c i l . M o n d a y ' s
performance turned out to be
something of a dramatic classic with
Sydney Harbour-Bridge resigning
from one post, only to put himself
forward to take u p another, petty
insults being traded around the
room faster than a stock market
crash, Andrew Meredith (RCS
A A O ) voting both for and against
the same motion and Cosmic (alias
Dave Clements) storming out i n a
tantrum, setting an example as to
how mature postgrads should
behave.
The reason behind this chaos lies
in a report put forward I C U Exec
and St Mary's Exec which, among
other things, suggests that Council
(yes, the childrens' creche I
described i n the first paragraph)
become the policy making body of
ICU. This proposal does two things.
Firstly it removes the right of
students to vote and talk on issues
concerning their future a n d the
future of this college. Secondly it
hands over these responsibilities to
a few people, most of w h o m were
never even voted into their positions
of power, but elected unopposed.
The majority of the debate, when
not dedicated to petty bickering and
rattle throwing, centred around how
this 'supreme' Council would go
about n o t i f y i n g its student
'populace' as to what decisions it
had made, instead of actually
debating as to whether or not a
student's right to speak a n d vote
should be removed.
However when a motion was
finally put forward giving students
the right to speak at Council it was
defeated by a large majority. Also
when, at last, Nigel Baker asked
'Whether Council believed that the
abolition of U G M s was too great a
price to pay for a merger with St
Mary's', Council decided that it was
not and promptly voted tp abolish
U G M s by a large majority.
The next question to be asked is
'why did Council vote this way?'
The answer to this can be gleaned
from a comment made to me by
Graham Price, secretary of St
Mary's Union. H e said, "The thing
that has always angered me about
these meetings (Council) is the
complete insecurity of the people
present.' From this, one can deduce
that the people on Council are there,
possibly, to boost their egos and
satisfy their megalomaniac
tendencies. So it comes as no
surprise that they should vote
through a motion giving themselves
supreme power over Imperial
College Union.

DEFEND UGM's
Would you like a student's union which
will:
• spend your money without your consent
• make decisions behind closed doors
• consist of Union Officers who do nothing and get away
with it
•take actions in your name behind your back
• be accountable only to itself
NO?
Sign the petitions in FELIX, IC Radio and STOIC to
defend UGM's from abolition. Turn up at the UGM
on Tuesday 31 st Jan in the JCR and make your voice
heard before it's too late.
