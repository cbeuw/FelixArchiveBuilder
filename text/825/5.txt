Opinion
T h e c a s e f o r s t u d e n t l o a n s
M y only disclaimer in this article is
that I am not a member of Consoc
or Indosc. M y reason for writing this
article is that I feel there is too much
bias in favour of the anti-loan lobby
and that this is n o t a fully
representative view of the feelings
of the people in College. This article
attempts to explore some less
debated ideas.
The purpose of higher education
Central to the loans debate is the
question of the purpose of higher
education. The major claims of the
anti-loans lobby is that the whole of
society benefits f r o m higher
education a n d should therefore
subsidise the privileged few who
enter into it.
In its guidelines published prior
to the White Paper the N U S quoted
Bruce Johnstone w h o said 'the
public benefits are such as more
enlightened discourse, lower crime
rates and more stable economy',
and yet Britain in the late 1980s with
more people than ever before i n
higher education shows none of
these attributes.
The concept that educating people
to a high standard makes them
better people is completely
fallacious. Student benefits from
higher education are said to be one
or more of the following; more
money, more options and more
control over life, and I believe that
this is predominantly true.
Academic Freedom
A further argument against loans is
that it will result in students having
less academic freedom both in the
courses they choose to take and in
'their right' to pursue thought freely
without pressures from the outside
world interferring. However, is such
freedom a right? Or is it a privilege
to be earned? I believe that academia
must remain accountable to society
in general if it is to benefit society
as a whole, but in the past it has all
too often adopted a clandestine
ivory tower approach giving what,
if crudely stated, can be said tc be
no more than a perpetual self ego
trip to those within it. H o w many
in academia (students and lecturers)
are aware of the demands that the
outside world is making? To be
honest, industry, commerce and the
government sector are finding it
increasingly hard to find graduates
and post docs of the appropriate
calibre and training to fill their
vacancies and this is despite the fact
that there are supposedly more
people i n higher education than
ever before. Surely this implies that
there is something wrong with
higher education at the present.
It think a turning point is now
occurring in higher education as the
power of academics decreases and
the demands of society increase,
and somewhere there must be a
balance between the immediate
needs of society-and the pursuit of
academic freedom which, if the
privilege is used properly, benefits
society.
These needs of society and the
world outside are increasingly being
met by vocational and sandwich
courses that are b e c o m i n g
increasingly popular with even the
most academically gifted students
and if loans are introduced I believe
that this trend will be accelerated.
The responsibility of loans
Having aired some views on the
purpose of higher education I now
wish to consider how this will be
affected by loans.
The anti-loans lobby claims that
loans will discourage students from
less well off backgrounds a n d
increase the drop out rate from
courses and the time taken to
complete courses. This argument
tends to centre around the notion
that at 18 the average potential
students is too young to take on the
responsibility of a loan and the
worries of repaying it. The White
Paper as it stands is simply
transferring the responsibility of
paying from parents to the student,
the student paying back in relation
to earnings. With the safeguards the
White Paper details in relation to
this, the loans system in terms of
paying is certainly no more unfair
than the current grants system. The
reason w h y students object to loans
is that it entails responsibility. Yet
as stated near the beginning of this
article, I believe students benefit as
much from higher education as does
the state as a whole. If students are
not responsible enough to face the
burden of loans are they responsible
enough to pass through higher
education? I believe that entering
higher eduction at 18 and living in
academia for three to four years is
an insular environment which leads
to false expectations and a sub-
optimal use of all facilities available
in undergraduate life caused by a
lack of direction i n what one is
d o i n g . Basically this is w e l l
demonstrated by IC student apathy.
Many potential students (though
I think fewer at IC) regard entry to
higher education as a right and a
time for a 'good doss' expecting the
state to subsidise it all. M a n y
students expect the state to pay an
average circa £15 per week housing
| benefit (much of which is illicitly
obtained) and yet easily spend at
i least £20 a week plus on entertain-
ments—particularly d r i n k i n g .
Personally I believe this expectation
is inherently selfish especially when
under current tight monetarist
policies and ever less cash to go
round there are many people in far
greater need of such benefits. OAPs,
single parent families, etc. For those
who don't believe m y claims o n
alcohol expenditure a trip to
Southside Bar o n a Friday night
should be worthwhile. However, I
am no killjoy and believe in having
fun but fun and selfishness don't
mix.
! I think loans will make people
more responsible to higher
education and more deserving of
the places they earn hopefully
encouraging people to earn with
more maturity and experience.
A balanced education
However, the White Paper does
contain o n e , s o m e w h a t
disconcerting, aspect which is that
of tokens to do courses and students
having the power to decide what
courses are r u n . T h e inherent
' problem in this is that students may
dismiss more theoretical or useless
course i n favour of more vocational
ones to the detriment of their overall
understanding. This is where the
free market policy of higher
education collapses and why, as I "
stated earlier, there needs to be a
balance between the immediate
needs of society as a whole and
academic freedom. However it may
mean that the quality of courses
i m p r o v e s as lecturers b i d to
maintain the popularity of their
subjects.
Conclusions
To conclude, I believe higher
education is a privilege and not a
right and that loans will encourage
responsibility i n students
encouraging entry at a more mature
age. This would be of benefit to both
students and society as a whole.
However i n such a system more
safeguards need to be applied to
ensure a r o u n d e d educational
balance i n options taken and to
maintain balance between the
immediate needs of society and the
privilege of academic freedom.
