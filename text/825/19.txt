City & Guilds blood donations
O n Tuesday January 31, the South
L o n d o n branch of the National
Blood Transfusion Service will be
holding a day-long session i n
Southside G y m . Their target is 160
donations during the day, and a list
for volunteers is posted in the City
& Guilds Union Office.
Every d o n a t i o n h a s to be
thoroughly tested before it can be
stored ready f o r use i n a n
emergency or an operation—blood
which has successfully been tested
has a shelf life of 35 days maximum.
Some tests can be performed at the
donation site itself; the rest must be
carried out in a laboratory, no more
than three hours after donation.
Testing starts with taking two
samples from the donation—all
three lots of blood are immediately
labelled to allow identification. One
sample is used for grouping; the
other is allowed to clot, forming a
serum which is used for testing for
diseases which may be transmitted
by transfusion. The labelling used
employs a bar code, allowing any
donation in the U K to be traced back
to its origins.
The grouping test identifies the
two main blood group systems—
A B O and Rhesus (Rh). The A B O
system falls into four m a i n
groups—O, A , B and A B , the R h
system divides into Rh positive and
Rh negative. Thus eight categories
of blood type are formed, aside from
other, more complicated, systems.
Most people will remember blood
grouping from ' O ' Level Biology.
A l l these tests c a n n o w be
performed automatically, w i t h
chemical changes being assessed by
photoelectric cells a n d results
compiled b y computer. Donor
records are also stored on computer,
the two systems being linked.
Disease testing o n the clotted
sample checks i n particular for
syphillis, hepatitis B and H I V . A l l
such tests are performed separately,
to allow use of the most sensitive,
rapid a n d economic method for
each. Syphillis is not as serious a
problem as it used to be, but still
exists i n the general public—each
test costs about five pence. Hepatitis
is a more serious problem, as the
virus lives i n the plasma, which is
pooled from many samples for
plasma products. Thus thousands of
people could be infected with
hepatitis from a single donation.
Several methods of screening exist
for hepatitis, all involving detection
of the virus in the blood. The cost
of the cheapest test is about twelve
pence per sample.
The most recent screen to be
introduced is one for H I V , which
looks for the H I V antibody. This is
one of the more expensive tests
carried out, at forty-five pence per
sample.
Many more tests are carried out,
most for tropical diseases which are
rare in the UK—this is w h y people
who have recently been to certain
countries are asked not to donate
(they may have returned with more
than just a tan!).
A l l blood that is collected in the
U K is collected by the BTS, part of
the NHS—there is as yet no private
service. There are no financial
rewards for giving blood, just a
satisfaction at having potentially
saved someone's life. Besides, it's
a good excuse to lie d o w n for half
an hour and grab a cup of tea during
the day.
Council
Sketch
A n d it a l l began so quietly.
Monday's Council sort of drifted
together with a resigned air. There
was little on the agenda that even
sparked a little enthusiasm from the
attendees. A little debate o n
subwardens was referred back to
Housing Committee because Council
was too bored to discuss it. A few
radicals felt the need to take legal
action against the A U T over their
boycott of exams, but nobody's
heart was in it.
But slowly the tension began to
build u p . Even more unlikely,
people began to wake u p . The
attacks o n democracy were
b e g i n n i n g . N e i l M c C l u s k e y
proposed a motion, which at first
reading, looked so uninteresting
that it could have passed as any
other Council paper. But Cosmic
tried to amend it! It must be worth
looking at. The motion made it no
longer c o m p u l s o r y f o r sub-
committees to present their minutes
to Council, merely to report to it.
Less things for Council members to
read, must be a good idea. With a
suprisingly short debate, the motion
was passed, meaning that the exec
(amongst others^ no longer have to
tell anyone exactly what they are
doing. Then all hell broke loose.
The S M H M S U / I C U working party
had found a problem over U G M s
after the proposed merger of the
Unions next year. It seemed unfair
that I C U (with the majority of
students) should hold the majority
of U G M s where Marys' opinions
were likely to be swamped. It seems
reasonable, except that the solution
is, obviously, to abolish U G M s and
make Council the supreme body.
M u c h of Council loved this; some
of Council thought it the most
outragous thing they h a d ever
heard, and so the fun began. Syd
H a r b o u r - B r i d g e p r o p o s e d
a m e n d m e n t after a m e n d m e n t
before anyone had had a chance to
comment on the original. In one of
the most sophisticated bit of
filibustering (delaying tactics) ever
seen, he pretended to support the
motion whilst delaying it for over an
hour. In attempting to mandate the
FELIX Editor to print reports he
brought back the oldest Council
chesnut of them all and forced the
debate several miles off the point
before the poor chairman had a
chance to take control. (Now repeat
after me, children, You can't tell the
FELIX Editor what to put in FELIX)
After half of S y d ' s garbled,
misunderstood and mostly unheard
amendments were passed and the
other half consigned to oblivion, he
w i t h d r e w the w h o l e l o t ,
triumphantly having moved the
meeting an hour closer to the
looming guillotine. Steph Snell then
picked u p the whole of Syd's
discarded amendments a n d got
them reinstated, wasting another
half an hour.
By now both sides were i n full
s w i n g w i t h hastily i m a g i n e d
amendments being created around
the table, pitched i n to be taken u p
by a voter, and then battered down
w i t h points of i n f o r m a t i o n ,
procedural motions, and good old
fashioned ranting. Dave Clements
was in fine form, turning pinker and
pinker whilst defending good old
home-spun democracy with all his
many years of experience. A t one
point a point of order was raised
challenging that the point of
information raised took precedence
over the procedural motion which
had interrupted a speaker to go
straight to a vote on an amendment.
But then it was all over. Democracy
had lost a battle and Council had
reccomended that it became the
supreme body. Disheartened and
exhausted, the meeting staggered its
way to the guillotine and fell apart.
We were dissapointed but not
disheartened. It's one thing for a
bunch of hacks to vote for their o w n
supremacy, quite another for the
people to vote away their
fundamental right of reply.

WALTER
WALTER
Old and new readers of this column
alike will soon become aware that
Walter hates to be the bearer of bad
news; any subject which might
come under this heading he tends
to treat lightly or not atall. H e
especially hates to be the first bearer
of bad news, and it is therefore with
real regret that he draws readers'
attention to the fact that papers for
this years circus of sabbatical
elections will be going up in about
a month, a n d that the race for
candidates is getting under way.
One always views the said circus
with a certain wry amusement; how
will a candidate announce his or her
intention of standing? Two years
ago, M r Sydney Harbour-Bridge got
his c a m p a i g n u n d e r w a y b y
standing for every committee i n
sight, and storming out of them all
in turn, carefully explaining w h y i n
a signed letter to FELLX afterwards.
Other people prefer the time
honoured method of loudly denying
that they intend to stand atall,
although those that must be
different pretend to be Charlie
Chaplin. Don't they, M r Goodwin?
So be warned: if a close friend
starts storming out of committees,
writing letters to FELIX, pretending
to be Charlie Chaplin, or most
damningly of a l l denying their
electorial intentions - take them
aside and talk sensibly to them. Try
to deflate their ego, to negate the
psychosis. If all else fails, Walter
recommends the use of a gallon of
paraffin and a match
As a break from this incessant
Union bilge, more news o n the
Australian takeover of west London,
which has now reached as far as the
K w a l i t y T a n d o o r i b y S o u t h
Kensington tube station. Walter
entered this establishment the other
day to be greeted by a suitably
dusky gentleman who treated h i m
to a wide smile and the phrase:
'G'day mate. This table do yer?'
Our hero whistled a polite chorus
of Waltzing Matilda, and retired
from the fray.
As an enraged aside, Walter has
just discovered that if you buy a
small portion of grated cheese from
the Caterpillar Cafe, it will cost y o u
25 pence. This is a blatant rip off for
what amounts to a small handful of
I cheap plastic cheddar. Walter
suggests a mass boycot of the
exhorbitant place, as only that will
persuade the conciencless profiteers
in power to recognize the fact of the
matter: their catering outlet is
disgracefully expensive. Vote with
your feet!
