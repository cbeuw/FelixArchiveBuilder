Central
Stores
closure
The College's Central Stores were
finally closed o n the 16th of
December. This was the culmination
of plans started in January of last
year which were intended to make
use of the space for the Chemistry
D e p a r t m e n t a n d f o r the
Interdisciplinary Research Centre's
Superconductor Research Unit.
Stocks are n o w stored i n
departmental stores and transferred
as required by internal requisition.
The plan was first announced in
a letter sent to all Heads of
Departments on January 7th, 1988.
A joint Trade Union Committee met
in March and decided to produce a
report i n response to this
a n n o u n c e m e n t , w h i c h w a s
p u b l i s h e d o n A p r i l 28th a n d
suggested that the existing stores
s h o u l d be r e f u r b i s h e d a n d
reorganised.
In a meeting between Heads of
Departments on June 1 the College
and Union reports were discussed
and it w a s decided that the
reorganisation should go ahead. It
was felt that the College had gone
too far d o w n the road of stores
specializing in numerous fields, and
that refurbishment of the pre-
existing C e n t r a l Stores w a s
unfeasible. T h e decision w a s
presented to the Unions i n a
meeting o n June 9 i n which the
College Secretary, John Smith,
stressed that devolving the Central
Stores into departmental stores did
not m e a n a n e n d to central
p u r c h a s i n g . Stocks w o u l d be
delivered to the Goods Inward
section a n d distributed to the
departments where they were
needed. There were to be no
redundancies as the seven members
of staff would be reallocated or put
in charge of transferring stocks
internally.
In order to avoid shortages the
newly appointed Deputy Finance
Officer, Philip Shaw, proposed that
stocks would be moved between
departmental stores by requisition.
Stationery is now kept on the fourth
floor in the Sherfield Building and
m o v e d to other stores i n a l l
departments as necessary. One of
the faults in the new system is the
duplication of the same goods i n
several places i n C o l l e g e . A
spokesman from the College Trades
Unions told FELIX that a central
stationery store would probably be
more efficient.
M r Bruce Kent, former President of
the C a m p a i g n for N u c l e a r
Disarmament (CND), spoke to a
meeting of the Methodist Society
yesterday lunchtime.
Around 80 people attended the
w i d e - r a n g i n g discussion that
covered topics from press bias,
phone tapping and the second
world war to US, Soviet and Labour
Party politics as well as nuclear
disarmament. The atmosphere was
generally friendly and M r Kent later
told FELIX that although the
audience may not have agreeded
with everything he said there was
not much disagreement.
He argued that the World has
become accustomed to nuclear arms
and regarded them as a fact of life.
He added that nuclear arms are
distracting peoples attention from
the real issues of pollution, health,
national debt and AIDS. However,
he was still optimistic and said that
recently the situation had changed
'dramatically'.
Paid at
last?
Students w h o worked o n the
Summer Letting Scheme in Beit Hall
and Hamlet Gardens last Summer
are to receive a bonus payment for
their work after waiting 3 months.
The Summer Letting Scheme lets
rooms i n College Accommodation
over the summer and is run by
students. Workers are promised a
m i n i m u m bonus payment for
working the whole summer plus a
variable amount based upon the
scheme's profits a n d their
individual performances.
College Accommodation Officer,
Loretto O'Callaghan told FELIX that
a part payment is to be made to
workers i n Beit Hall subject to a
written report from last year's
scheme co-ordinator, S i m o n
Chadwick, whilst those in Hamlet
Gardens will be paid i n full. She
said that the delay was due to M r
Chadwick's refusal to submit a
report to h e r , w i t h bonus
recommendations. Students who
worked in Evelyn Gardens will not
be paid until M r Chadwick presents
his report.
M r Chadwick is refusing to
present his report until he is paid for
two weeks work which he claims
the College has not paid him for. Ms
O'Callaghan has now agreed to
authorise this payment, a n d is
witholding M r Chadwick's overtime
j claim until he presents his report;.
The College is considering evicting
two students from its houses i n
Evelyn Gardens if they do not
arrange for payment of their rent
today. Senior Assistant Finance
Officer Malcolm Aldridge told
FELIX that the-College is legally
entitled to remove people who have
defaulted on their rent.
IC Union President Nigel Baker is
unsure what stance the Union
should take o n the students'
position. H e told FELIX that the
College had Â£21000 worth of unpaid
residence bills last term. H e is
against any action which may
antagonise this problem, which may
lead to rents increasing i n the
future.
IC Union is considering the opening
of a Union Playgroup in the Union's
Lower Lounge.
Union President, Nigel Baker, told
FELIX that he was making a
'feasibility study' into a D a y
N u r s e r y w i t h W e s t m i n s t e r
Council's Child Day Care Adviser.
If the idea is approved at IC Union's
Council in March, the Nursery will
be held i n the Union Building's
L o w e r Lounge o n w e e k d a y s
between 9 am and 12 noon.
25 Children between the ages of
3 and 5 will be admitted, with
children of students being given
priority. A Child Nurse will be
employed to run the centre with
parents helping on a rota system.
