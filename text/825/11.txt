ICU - the Fourth Reich?
By now the details of the decisions taken at ICU council and the details
of the motion to be taken to next weeks U G M will have been reported
by FELIX and ICU will have a clear choice on whether to abolish U G M s
as the supreme body of the union. The purpose of this article is not to
criticise any of the union officers for their views, which I believe to be
sincerely held. It is to initiate a more detailed debate on the issues raised
by the proposal and to think through some of the consequences for the
union and for FELIX. I do not believe that such a debate has occurred,
certainly not at the recent council meeting. This article is intentionally
brief and so not exhaustive. It is also provocative, but so is the proposal
to be put to the U G M .
more polarised, and often less
representative groups eg Major Sub
Committees (MSC's). In effect this
power would place more stresses on
Council as a decision making body
increasing its factionalism. Indeed,
it is questionable whether Council
at the moment conducts itself
effectively i n terms of debate and
discussion.
There are other ways in which the
proposed change in the balance of
power could affect Council. For
instance it would be much easier for
a sabbatical to revoke their election
manifesto confident i n the
knowledge that 20 to 30 votes at
Council would see him, or her,
through the year.
In the same way major policy
decisions could be taken by groups
of individuals elected by, though
not representative of, the student
body. Thus there would be the
distinct danger that the views of the
Union as would be expressed by the
Council would significantly diverge
from the views of students. The
major difference from the current
situation is that this could arise
consciously by Council members
taking a 'more balanced view'rather
than passive apathy at U G M s .
Lastly a parallel proposal has been
made at Council for more authority
to be delegated to its sub-
committees. This delegation could
be justified b y managerial
arguments. H o w e v e r , despite
appearances, in a student union the
management arguments must be
subjugated to those of democracy
and accountability. If this is not
challenged a system is legitimised
where key decisions are taken by an
oligarchy of no more than 8 or 9
people. I understand that M r s
Thatcher uses the same system
herself.
FELIX
The problem
Perhaps the clearest aspect of the
matter. It is to integrate Saint Mary's
Hospital Medical School Students
Union ( S M H M S S U ) into I C U as a
Constituent College Union with full
participation i n the recostituted
union of ICU, within the constraints
of a split site. This is a dilemma
facing a n u m b e r of colleges
throughout London and no doubt
the executive would have analysed
their solutions.
The working party solution
The proposal to radically change
the status of U G M s is an extreme
proposal which I would now like to
discuss at some length.
Is it Democratic?
This is, of course, not the question
which is central but will no doubt
be raised b y many students. The
answer is that the Union would still
be run along broadly democratic
lines with mass elections, with an
A G M w h e r e reports c a n be
presented and Emergency General
Meetings (EGMs) that can be called
by students. However, it is better to
question whether this framework,
would strengthen the Union i n
terms of increased participation in
its affairs a n d its campaigns by
students. I think not.
ICU Council
The incorporation of medical
school student union reps o n
C o u n c i l w i l l n o t change it
appreciably. Their numbers will be
too small to significantly influence
Council other than as a pressure
group. The same problems that exist
with the representative role of
U G M s would exist in microcosm on
Council. The real changes would be
due to the concentration of
sovereign power i n the hands of a
small core of individuals who will be
free of any wider accountability to
the student b o d y . Their
accountability would be to smaller,
It is quite clear that the abolition
of U G M s would leave FELIX as the
o n l y m e d i u m for direct
communication between I C U and its
sabbaticals. This u n d o u b t e d l y
would make FELIX much more
powerful within the Union. That the
Exec realise this is clear from their
rather heavy handed attempt to
exert authority over the Editor and
the editorial authority of FELIX. In
a very specific way the exec will
begin to define themselves acting as
if they are accountable to FELIX. It
is through FELIX that they will have
to persuade, convince, justify and
campaign.
This raises the serious question of
editorial freedom that I am sure Bill
Goodwin can discuss elsewhere. I
would only offer the view that the
power of FELIX will undoubtedly
place it i n a very good postion to
construct alliances of its own and to
play the system whether as 'king-
m a k e r ' for future sabbatical
candidates or as a voice of a certain
section of the Union. This will
crystalise the central problem and
the greatest argument against
increasing de facto the power of
FELIX. This is again accountability.
A n editor with any degree of
editorial freedom would only be
nominally accountable to Council.
Council would, therefore, become
dependent on the whim of such an
editor acting alone (rather like Lee
Harvey Oswald). Should Council
find this intolerable and totally
constrain the editor FELIX would
become the docile organ of the
Union rather like Pravda. A n d the
Union would have sacrificed both
FELIX and its U G M on the basis of
short term goals.
Participation
The power of an open meeting to
involve ordinary members i n
important affairs of the Union is
undeniable. Certainly a general
apathy - perhaps complacency -
amongst students exists yet ther
have been m a n y occasions
throughout the last ten years when
600 people packed the Great Hall
ans played an important role i n
Union policy. Eliminate the U G M
and such popular involvement i n
student politics will be severely
diminished. It isinteresting to see
that no national trade union has
abandoned the public meeting as an
effective m e c h a n i s m for the
participation ofmembers i n party
affairs. They recognise that the only
realpower they have is through a
mass action. H o w sure would
afuture president be of being able to
involve students in massaction?
F r a g m e n t a t i o n o f the U n i o n
I have discussed a situation where
a remote council and executive lose
contact with the views of the
student body. I suspect that if this
occurs then eventually those bodies
that offer participation will attract
the enthusiasm and loyalty of
students, in particular the C C U s and
to a lesser extent the M S C s . This
would inevitably lead to a less
corporate approach to decision
making with ICU's role diminishing
in proportion to its loss of popular
support. The Exec will have to
reconcile many more vocal a n d
mandated council members less
prepared to compromise. A new
tribalism would emerge.
The election a n d dismissal of
sabbaticals
I am old enough to know former
presidents of the I C U who were
elected by and from Council and
were dismissable by Council. The
inevitable consequence of making
C o u n c i l supreme is that a n y
sabbatical who is gets a vote of no
confidence at a meeting would
probably be unable to continue in
office. I also suspect that a proposal
would eventually emerge to return
to the election of the sabbaticals by
Council acting as an electoral
college. Y o u may think this last
point a flight of fantasy yet it is not
so distant from the leap to create a
sovereign Council.
The solution
I cannot do other than stimulate
a debate from which I hope amore
inspired vision emerges. I do not
accept that there is no federal
solution w h i c h preserves a n d
enhances both the new C C U and
the reconstituted I C / S M H M S S U .
Having decided that the baby and
the bathwater should be separated
the drowning of the baby is not an
acceptable alternative.
