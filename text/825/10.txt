A butterfly stomach, a dry mouth,
sweaty palms, a thumping heart, a
tense neck and a dull, pounding
headache; we all know how it feels.
Stress has become a cliche of the
eighties to the point where it has
been accepted as normal. It is
'trendy' to be busy, to be rushing
around the place, to have 'no time
to stop'. The medical dangers of
stress have h o w e v e r , been
constantly buried in the subterfuge
of action. A recent survey
discovered that almost 80% of
people medically classified as being
in a 'high stress risk group',
believed that they were i n no
medical danger as a result of the
stress they were under. Medical
history tells a different story.
Stress claims to be one of the
biggest Twentieth Century killers,
directly linked to heart disease and
cancer, responsible for 75% of all
illness in Britain today. It costs about
40 million working days each year,
and accounts for 50% of deaths i n
men over 40 in Britain.
A recent survey showed that
university students are under
greater stress than students in any
other area of education. It also
discovered that even greater levels
of stress are encountered at
universities falling into one of the
following categories.
i) those situated in the centre of
large cities.
ii) Those containing an uneven
ratio of males and females.
iii) Those situated in 'expensive
living cost' regions
iv) Those with high academic
entrance requirements
v) Those specialising in
medicine, veterinary medicine,
' science or engineering.
On this basis, Imperial College
could be renamed 'Stress City.'
Stress-related disease is now so
prevalent it is estimated to cost the
medical and social services an
average of £55 million a year—two
or three per cent of the gross
national product.
Research into stress is going on all
the time, and it is now thought that
people can become hooked on the
hormones they produce under
stress. Permanently busy people can
get h i g h o n their o w n 'nor-
adrenaline', and so they become
THE TELL TALE SIGNS OF STRESS
• Do you feel guilty when relaxing—uneasy if not 'on the go'?
• Do you lie awake worrying about tomorrow?
• Are you tense...does you neck feel 'knotted up'?
• Are you impatient or irritable—do you interrupt when others
are talking?
• Do you feel that you have a lot on your mind —have difficulty
concentrating?
• Are you smoking or drinking more—do you eat in a hurry?
• Does life seem full of crises—are you always having rows?
• Do you find it difficult to make decisions?
• Do you feel frustrated when people don't do what you want?

dependent on constant challenge,
and non-stop deadlines is the only
way to produce their best.
People experience stress
differently. Some thrive on what
others perceive to be negative
pressure; too little stimulus can also
be stressful.
Our response to stress is part of
the dynamics of staying alive, the
primal instinct to survive. However,
too much noise, too many people,
crowded cities, not enough air,
exercise, peace or tranqulity,
constant self-induced pressure over
academic work, and a consuming
desire to excel in examinations all
jangle the nerve endings, causing
irritability, apathy, tension and,
eventually, illness.
Eating badly, drinking too much
and particularly smoking can all
cause strain. Mental stress is
generated by aggression, impati-
ence, anger, fear, anxiety, emotional
conflict, inner turmoil, financial
insecurity, competitiveness and all
the major life events from childbirth
through marriage to divorce and
bereavement.
Chemical treatments such as
tranquillisers are often more
harmful than beneficial, and all-to-
often become addictive. Last year
fifteen million prescriptions were
written for tranquillisers. It is
estimated that there could be three
million addicts i n Britain.
Alternative therapies and simple
relaxation exercises have provided
a far more effective releif from the
symptoms i n a number of cases.
Aromatherapy, the art of healing
and relieving stress w i t h the
essentiaroils of plants is rapidly
increasing i n popularity, and many
doctors recommend meditation and
yoga for relaxation. A good way to
help keep stress d o w n is to
remember to breath deeply from the
diaphragm and not the chest. This
controls the blood pressure and
reduces the tension in muscles.
It is important to cut down on
drinking and smoking. These may
be used to 'unwind', but the relief
is only temporary, and the effect
they have numbs, rather than
solves, a problem. It is also obvious
that a large number of people at
Imperial have little or no beneficial
exercise in their daily schedule. N o
miracles are required i n this area.
You will survive if you are not in the
1st X V i n rugby. Gentle rhythmic
cycling, jogging or swimming are
ideal ways of reducing the tension
caused by stress. They release pent-
up energy and encourage deep,
refreshing sleep.
Be aware of the damage stress can
cause you. Review your lifestyle and
under. Take it easy, plan ahead so
that you can have 'evenings o f f
occasionally, and don't ever believe
that getting tomorrow's problem
sheet in is the most important thing
in the world.
M y aim is not to leave you with
a 10% increase i n stress levels,
because you are so worried about
the dangers of stress! Reasonable
levels of stress are quite natural and
inherently good. Stress is the body's
ammunition i n danger. It is a state
of arousal when the body responds
to unusual demands. The release of
stress chemicals such as adrenaline,
increased blood pressure, heart rate,
oxygen intake and blood flow to the
muscles are all things that enable us
to move fast and think clearly. But
if the pressure is kept u p for too
long, those responses become
h a r m f u l , u n h e a l t h y a n d
counterproductive.
Working on this feature made me
more and more aware of the risks
evident at Imperial. Exams matter,
degrees matter, careers matter:
Health matters immeasurably more
