n track - Brunei
The oil and gas rich State of Brunei
Darrussalam, o n the northern coast
of the island of Borneo, is one of the
smallest and wealthiest nations in
the world. With a n area of 5,765
square kilometres and a population
of 220,000, Brunei has a per capita
income of about US$17,000 per year,
giving its people one of the highest
standards of living in Asia.
The country is a monarchy, ruled
by H i s Majesty S i r Hassanal
Bolkiah. Brunei w a s a British
protectorate until January 1 1984
w h e n it became independent. The
capital is Bandan Seri Begawan.
The country has not developed
quite as fully as a tourist spot,
though the potential is there. This
country would be for those who are
tired of going to the common places.
It will be a change albeit a n
expensive one.
The climate is equatorial with high
temperature, humidity and rainfall.
Temperatures average 28 Â°C and
there is little variation. So take with
you t-shirts, short sleeve shirts and
shorts. It tends to get very hot
especially under the sun.
The first thing you notice about
Brunei, as your plane prepares to
land, is the greenery. Green trees,
grass and bushes everywhere
It seems they have built a city in
the middle of the jungle.
The capital itself is small, probably
the size of Kensington. Everyone
knows everyone there. Thanks to
oil, however, the cars you will find
on the roads will be of the latest
m o d e l . A l m o s t e v e r y t h i n g is
imported, as it is cheaper to do so.
That includes even the vegetables.
The most famous landmark of
Brunei is the Sultan O m a n A l i
Saifuddin Mosque, in the capital,
named after the present ruler's
father. It's simply majestic. You just
have to stand back and look. It is an
edifice of classical Islamic
architecture. Its distinct feature is
the gold-plated dome which rises to
a height of 52 metres. Be careful that
you are properly dressed and leave
your shoes/sandals outside when
you go i n .
Part of the capital stands on water.
It is a grouping of small villages on
Brunei River called Kampu.ig Ayer
(or water village). In fact it was the
original capital and synonymous
with Brunei itself. The Italian
traveller, Antonia Pigaletta, who
travelled with Magellan and arrived
in 1521, described it as a city of
25,000 families.
The town is basically an extensive
collection of houses on stilts. These
houses have a l l t h e luxuries
normally associated with modern
living, including schools, clinics,
post offices, electricity and water
supplies. Take a tour of this village
by one of the numerous water taxis
available. It's a bit of a wonder that
they don't get tired of living there,
surely if you don't look where you
are going, you end u p with wet
clothes.
The N u r u l Iman Palace is the
official residence of His Majesty, the
Sultan. Y o u should be contented
with just a look from outside as it
is not open to the public. However,
if your visit coincides with the Hari
Raya Festival (at the end of the
fasting month of Ramadan) the
palace is open and the public is
invited to visit the Royal Family and
look around the palace. This is
usually some time i n April or M a y .
The other places to visit are the
Brunei M u s e u m and the Arts and
Handicrafts Centre. The museum
has a large collection of exhibits of
the cultural heritage of the country.
The Arts and Handicrafts Centre
offers silverware, bronzeware and
brassware w h i c h are crafted
according to the Malay Cultural
Heritage. One thing to see, is how
the Kris is made. Kris is the Malay's
I ancient weapon. It has a razor sharp
blade which is usually wavy. It was
used by the royalty and commoners
in the old days.
Seria is the most vital town after
the capital and has been the seat of
Brunei's petroleum industry since
i oil was first struck there in 1929. Just
outside this oil town is Lumut
where the world's largest Liquefied
Natural Gas plant operates.
The cheapest places to stay i n
Brunei are propably the Brunei
Hotel and Capitol Hostel. The rates
are still pretty high. Phone them
from the airport.
Transport is the most frustrating
aspect here. Public transport is
virtually non-existent except for the
very expensive taxis. Everyone here
seems to have one or two cars.
Luckily the capital is small enough
that you can visit all the places on
foot. Though as I said, it can get
bloody hot walking around.
There are coaches to other towns
running from the bus station i n the
city centre.
There are no direct flights to
Bandan Seri Begawan from London.
You will have to go to Singapore
and take a connecting flight. The
fare from Singapore to Brunei is
about the same as from L o n d o n to
Singapore, there is a wide variety
from Aeroflot (very cheap but via
Moscow, a painfully long flight) to
the direct flight b y Singapore
Airlines. For British citizens, visas
are not required for visits u p to
thirty days.
N o t e : B r u n e i is a n Islamic
country. So please dress modestly.
Kissing and holding hands in public
is frowned upon.
