Music
Glass-ware
O n the Richter scale of weirdness
Glass' music is more than a tremor
but less than a Tippett. It is part of
the minimalist genre, which tries to
make music i n the simplest possible
way, that is with the least number
of themes. The trick is to use the
same melody repeatedly without
letting the music become boring,
and Glass manages this fairly well.
He often takes the theme, stretches
it out i n time and adds it to itself,
so that we have repetition on two
or three time scales. The whole
thing is like the superposition of
waves, and this may be w h y Glass
likes the idea of Light. H i s music is
approachable by all because it has
some dashing good tunes (although
it is too complex to whistle).
A characteristic example of his
work is the opera Einstein on the
Beach (CBS Records M 4 K 38875).
The structure consists of long Glassy
arpeggios f o r m i n g the meat,
separated by Knee Plays. This is a
strange name but the entire opera
is self-consciously strange. The
Knee Plays are nonsense texts set to
music. In the first Knee Play we start
with a single deep note on a
synthesizer to which a chorus of
female voices counting beats in a bar
is added. After a few repetitions a
w o m a n starts counting over the
chorus and then reads a text which
starts 'Will it get some w i n d for the
sailboat. A n d it could get for it is.
It could get the railroad for these
workers. A n d it could be were it is.
It could Franky it could be Franky
it could be very fresh and clean...'
and so on. This first Knee Play is
probably the parody of a Bach
fugue.
The musical imagery is quite
interesting w i t h three themes
recurring throughout. These are the
Train, the Trial and the Spaceship.
The train represents both the toy
trains that Einstein played with as
a child and also the trains used in
his thought experiments to display
the bizarre effects of Special
Relativity. In the Trial we are shown
what must have been Einstein's
nightmare in which he has to face
the terrible consequences of his
work on the bomb. The Spaceship
represents another of the standard
gedanken experiments, and also the
idea of freedom. Sometimes a solo
violin plays arpeggios i n the
foreground set against a complex
and repetitive backdrop of electronic
keyboards and chorus. The violinist
was dressed as Einstein in the
performance in the N e w York Met
because, like Sherlock Holmes,
Einstein was a part-time fiddler.
• This is not a recording which I
would buy, but it does make a
refreshing change f r o m the
m a i n s t r e a m i.e. Eine K l e i n e
Nachtmusik, The Four Seasons...
His latest opera The Making of the
Representative of Planet 8 has been a
huge success. It was broadcast on
Radio 3 on December 12, and is
based on a novel by Dorothy
Lessing in which an ice age destroys
all life on planet 8—a planet not
unlike our own. The story is very
moving, the music's good so if you
come across a recording give it a try.

Philip Glass likes his new magnetic boots.
Rock locks
KERRANG!
The Dirty Strangers—Trill Records
Rocky City Angels—Geffen Records
The Dogs D'Amour—China Records
Although these albums have been
on release for about one and-a-half
months now, no one seems to have
picked up on them yet, so I think an
airing in FELIX will do them no
harm.
I'll start with the Dirty Strangers
which included guest appearances
from Keith Richards, Ronnie W o o d
and Phil Spalding. It is clear to see
w h y Ron and Keith were included,
as this record is pure early seventies
Stones, it is one of the most blatant
and sincere of the current set of
Stones rip-off records, that is no
reason to shun and dismiss it as the
songs are fresh, bouncy and often
amusing. This is all good stuff as the
guitar work is sleazy and growls at
the tunes, a perfect complement to
the fake cockney of the lead vocals.
The Rock City Angels are a young
American band from Tennessee and
are another of Geffen Records'
excellent pool of mean, talented and
street wise bands, such as Tesla and
Guns and Roses, i n fact the G'N'R
similarity doesn't stop there. This is
a superb mix of old white blues and
mean red neck boogie a la Lynard
Skynard. The guitar work of Mike
Barnes and Doug Banx is quite
considerable coming up with lively,
throw-away tunes like Hush Child to
the haunting classic Mary. The song
writing is equally accomplished with
deep emotion and though coming
through well is the harsh social
comment made in Beyond Babylon.
O n the whole" it is a long way
r e m o v e d f r o m the 'get-your-
knickers-off-girl-and-have-a-good-
time' type of song that has become
expected of heavy rock music. If
nothing else this record provides
good value, giving you four sides of
fine music for the price of a single
L P .
Although looking at the Dogs
D'Amour one would expect to hear
something like the Motley Crue
sound, the music contained within
owes more to the classic white blues
of the mid- to late sixties and the
attitude of someone like Hanoi Rocks.
The Dogs are a British band who
have risen through the clubs and
have just beaten their
contemporaries The Quireboys to a
major record deal.
A s is vogue nowadays, the vocals
are grave and strained, though
tuneful throughout. Again we see
a high level of song writing ability,
this time from lead vocalist Tyla, he
goes from the bad ass rock ' n ' roll
of Debauchery to the tearful lament
of How Come it Never Rains. A l l this
is thrown carefully on top of the dirt
sweet guitars of Jo Dog, with a neat
bass, drum, and sax back to tidy
things up with. This could have
easily been lost on a first album but
the production of Mark Dearnley,
has held it together, he has been
creative though cautious and also
managed to give it a live thrill. A l l
in all probably the best of the three
LPs.

Well, if the records are half as good
as the reviews we should soon be
hearing this dense vinyl from all
those good time boys on Radio
Three. Nice one Dave.
