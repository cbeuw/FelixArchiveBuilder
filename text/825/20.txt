Loans demo faces
set-back
The National Union of Students
London branch ( N U S London) and
the University of London Union
have pulled out of the anti-loans
march scheduled for 1 February.
Members of the Federal Campaigns
Committee (FCC) , a group set up
by the U L U President's Council to
discuss student loans have now
accepted responsibility for the
demonstration.
The march was initially planned
by N U S London for February 1st to
coincide with the last day for
submission of comments o n the
G o v e r n m e n t W h i t e Paper o n
student loans. They withdrew
because they believed that they did
not have the resources to organise
the m a r c h safely. T h e U L U
Executive C o m m i t t e e h a d
previously passed a policy to
support the N U S and so also
decided to withdraw.
Louise V a n der Straeten, Vice
President of U L U told FELIX that
the U L U Exec had no resources to
organise the march itself and added
that several members of the Exec
w o u l d be unavailable o n 1st
February due to prior engagements.
She said that U L U would be writing
to its constituent unions, stating its
withdrawal of all support for the
demonstration and said that they
would now concentrate their efforts
on the march organised by N U S
National on February 25th.
In a discussion o n M o n d a y
evening described by the Chairman
of the meeting as 'farcical', a motion
was passed to use the title U L U F C C
on the publicity prepared for the
march. Simon Aldiss, Co-President
of the School of Oriental and African
Studies (SOAS) proposed that the
leaflets be headed with the words
'London Students Against Loans' to
avoid use of the U L U name but
several members felt that such
publicity needed 'a commitment of
actual organisations a n d
representatives.' A subsequent vote
resulted i n an 18-14 majority i n
favour of the use of the name U L U
F C C .
U L U Acting-President, Nicola
Jones expressed her anger at the use
of this name and stressed that 'the
U L U Executive does not support the
march a n d the F C C is not a
recognised body of U L U . ' She also
pointed out that the use of the title
was illegal and that U L U would
consider taking legal action against
anyone involved i n the production
or distribution of publicity bearing
it.
The F C C printed thirty thousand
leaflets using the name U L U F C C
and claiming support from the N U S
Universities National Committee,
but following a meeting of the U L U
exec o n Tuesday w h e n t h e
Executive again rejected requests to
support the march new leaflets
headed 'London Loans Campaign'
have been printed.
Keith Budden, U L U International
Officer, whose name is on the public
order bill for the march argued that
it would continue without U L U and
N U S support. He has negotiated a
route with the police which will take
the march from Finsbury Circus to
Shoreditch Park and has insured
himself for up to £3/4m. He insisted
that the Executive's support is
needed 'to provide money for
leaflets, stewards' bibs, a lorry with
a P A and a number of other items.'
He added that the use of the name
U L U F C C would give 'credioility' to
the march.
M r A l d i s s a n d J i m C o y l e ,
President of Goldsmiths College
Student Union have since added
their names to the public order bill
for the march and, along with the
presidents of the Institute of
Education and City University and
the co-presidents of Queen Mary
College and S O A S , have set up an
organising committee for the march.
A meeting of 20 stewards was
h e l d last night after further
communication with the police. The
organisers intend to ' v e t ' the
stewards and will be providing
them with bibs and providing the
police with photocopies of their
union cards. They hope that 'up to
80 stewards' will be available to
oversee the demonstration.
Imperial College Union held an
emergency executive meeting o n
Wednesday morning at which it was
noted that the original decision to
support the demonstration was
made at the last U G M o n the
understanding that the N U S was
the organising body. The Executive
released a statement withdrawing
its support for the march o n the
basis that such action would 'place
the members of IC Union in physical
danger.' The decision overturns a
motion passed at the last U G M on
a technicality. The proposer of the
motion, Julian Moore, now intends
to support the Executive i n their
decision.
AUT
Update
IC Union is to investigate the legal
position of students a n d their
Universities where degrees are
affected by the A U T ' s examination
boycott after a mandate at Monday's
Council meeting.
Union President, Nigel Baker is to
visit a barrister today in order to find
out whether there is any legally
binding requirement for Universities
to provide final examinations. If
there is a legal case for students to
take up, M r Baker hopes its use will
put pressure o n Universities to
support the A U T ' s claim for a wage
increase for 1988/89. He added that
he thought there may be other legal
grounds for a court case apart from
a breach of contract, saying 'We are
looking at all sides of it.'
Executive
Announcement
• I C U has a policy that it should
support the demonstration o n
February 1.
•This support was given o n the
understanding that the N U S had
called a national demonstration on
February 1.
• I C U Exec has met a n d , i n
agreement with the proposer of the
motion, has decided that IMPERIAL
C O L L E G E U N I O N W I L L N O T BE
SUPPORTING T H E D E M O N S T R A -
T I O N O N F E B R U A R Y 1.
The reasons for this are:
• The N U S has withdrawn the
march.
• U L U feel that they do not have the
resources to organise the march
properly and so are not.
• Political activists, ie members of
Socialist Workers Students Society
and Militant, are now organising the
march.
•The stewards are likely to be
members of SWSS.
• SWSS are campaigning for a n
illegal march to the DES on that day.
• The Exec feel that the march is
likely to degenerate into a riot.
•The Exec feel that if I C U support
the march we will be placing the
members of this Union in physical
danger since we cannot guarantee
their safety.
• I hope y o u understand the
reasons for this decision.
