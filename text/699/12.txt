Elections
As I sit here, typing ths article into my word
processor and hoping in vain for some
inspiration, I leaf through last week's FELIX
and come upon an article by a group calling
itself QT Soc and, cheered by the fact that
my efforts, no matter how inadequate, can't
be as bad as that, the inspiration comes
flooding back, and I remember that the
Photosoc A G M (Annual General Massacre!)
is going to be held on Friday March 15 in
Southside Lounge (above the TV room), and
that the election papers have already been
up for a whole week, and that this is one of
the longest sentences I have ever written. If
you want to stand for next year's committee,
then you must put your name on the paper
(which, by the way, is on our usual
noticeboard) before it is taken down on the
morning of the election, although if there
aren't enough names on it by then we may
force innocent passers by to stand!
The other thing which comes to mind is
that there will be a lecture, slide-show and
demonstration of some varied and unusual
photographic equipment by two gentlemen
from the famous camera shop Fox Talbot'.
This will be on Thursday March 21 in Elec
Eng 408 at 6.00pm, and thats all folks!

Socially useful
Following Mike Cooley's inspiring talk
'Engineering Socially Useful Products', the
Society has formed links between Imperial
College and the Greater London Enterprise
Board, and have discussed some project
ideas with them. If anyone is interested in the
possibility of carrying out a 'socially useful'
project, ranging from computer
programming to practical engineering, and is
not already on the list of those interested in
the technology network please could they let
J Michaelis Mech Eng 2 know. The Civil
Engineering department has kindly let us use
their workshop facilities on Wednesday
afternoons, for making special toys for
mentally and/or physically handicapped
children in North Kensington; please come
along and help.
CATHSOC
AGM
The Imperial College Catholic Society will
hold its Annual General Meeting on Tuesday
12 March—immediately after mass at
12.30pm—in Aero 452. We would strongly
urge all our membership to turn up to this
meeting: the future depends upon it! This
appeal is of course extended to all Catholics
at Imperial. Even if you haven't been near us
for the whole year please make an effort to
come. Perhaps you have a very good reason
for not having came before; if this is the case
then we'd be glad to hear it. Our priority is to
provide a service for all Catholics at the
College—but only you can tell us what needs
to be done.
It is therefore also our intention to hold an
open meeting on Tuesday 19 March in
Chemistry 231 (Again, after mass) at
12.30pm. The purpose of this meeting will be
to discuss and plan our activities for the
coming term and indeed to try and plot an
overall course for next year. Once more we
would dearly like to see as many people as
possible at this meeting; it is a vital part of our
commitment as Christians that we make
efforts to reach the wider community at
College and that we find concrete practical
methods for doing so and this will be
precisely our aim on that day. Again, please
come and participate.
In the interim, if anyone has any queries to
make about the Cathsoc, about standing for
a post or about any other matter concerning
the society then please contact me, Stephen
Curry via the Physics Letter racks. Thanks.

More crap
A long time ago in a place far, far away (last
week in Southside bar) a group of men
roared hilariously. The timid man, who
claimed to be Secretary, continued 'No, it's
true I tell you, we have been challenged!'.
The silence was shattered when the
Publicity Officer drop kicked his poodle.
'Surely you can't be serious' he cried,
converting the dog through the goal-posts.
'Yes I am', retorted the Secretary, 'and
stop calling me Shirley!' The Publicity officer
was stunned. 'Do you realise what an event
this would make? It'll be huge, enormous. It
could be bigger than the Treasurer's pri...'.
'Enough of this crudity' boomed a voice
from above 'Bah gum ther's trouble at mill'.
'Oh no! Now look what you've
done—you've woken the Chairman! We're
doomed, doomed!', cried the Secretary as he
dived for cover. Too late! A pastie smote him
straight between the eyes and he fell, mashed
out of his skull.
'Oh that's what it is' said the Publicity
Officer. 'I've being using him as one of my
goal-posts'.
'So you have', boomed the voice, 'and
here's your poodle back'. The Publicity
Officer then left with the dog in such a place
that it made the Treasurer's girlfriend blush.
The survivors of the carnage pulled
themselves together and discussed the full
implications of the challenge.
The Champions: QT Soc
The Challengers: PP Soc
Weapons: Pillows
Date: TBA
The Committee dispatched two men to
deal with PP Soc and carried on with 'Any
Other Business'.
