Ramones: Chasing The Night
A couple of weeks after the
release of Howling At The
Moon, the 12 inch single has
instead fronted with Chasing
The Night. A much more
rocky ditty than the Dave
Stewart production. I prefer it.
The question now is will they
change the 7 inch?
Go West: We Close Our Eyes
Sounds just like Paul Young
but it ain't him. Has Howard
Jones synths but it ain't him
either. Derivative certainly but
it's still a good song. Pop rock
is probably the best way to
d e s c r i b e it. O h , o n e
thing—don't get the picture
disc like I did—the quality is
well naff.
Limbo: Putting on The Ritz
A 'AA' release with Man-
Nited, the Mike H a r d i n g
football song pisstake, but
this remake of the Irving
Berlin Classic is definitely my
f a v o u r i t e . L i m b o a r e a
Huddersfield vocal harmony
band, but instead of poncing
around like the Flying Pickets,
this band heads for a blend of
Skiffle and Barbershop. It's
good.
Billy Bragg: Between The
Wars
I heard this on Saturday
Live and dashed out to buy the
album, only to find it wasn't on
it. Now a single release I'll
dash out to buy that instead. A
mournfully simple folk song
sung with acoustic guitar, I
have seldom been moved so
much by the words of a song.
With three other tracks thrown
in for only £1.25 it is excellent
value.
Pumb Blenders: Love Boat
A w f u l A m e r i c a n d i s c o
rubbish.
David Cassidy: The Last Kiss
I always hated this guy.
When I was about five, all the
g i r l s I f a n c i e d w e r e n ' t
interested (nothing c h a n -
ges!). Time goes on and now I
find I can enjoy his music
while all those contemporary
females put him down as a
has-been. Sounds very 70's.
He even sounds like David
S o u l ( r e m e m b e r Silver
Lady?). An O K song though.
Boring, but OK.
CINEMA
Lovers'
Lives
From a personal point of view,
I am b e g i n n i n g to find
r o m a n c e very t i r e s o m e ,
e s p e c i a l l y that of other
people. Prying into lover's
lives is like sleeping in their
sheets, and to have them
thrust in your face at half past
ten in the morning does little
for me or my temper.
Dance with a Stranger is the
tragic tale of ordinary lovers;
and tragically ordinary it is
too. Ruth Ellis, a London tart,
CINEMA
Carmen
Hot on the heels of Carlos
Saura and Peter Brooks,
Francesco Rosi presents his
version of the opera.
Rosi realises here the hope
of opera to achieve transc-
endence with sound and
image. Yet Rosi does this
within the frame-work of
cinema, he reconciles the
theatricality that is opera with
the scope and intimacy that is
in the grasp of cinema. Mind,
Carmen is possibly the easiest
opera, at least with respect to
its dynamics, to adapt for
cinema, as Rosi admitted
l i v e d w i t h h e r p r o t e g e
Desmond Cussen for ten
years. He loved her. She loved
David Blakely, a young but
depressive racing driver, with
a flare for losing. She became
pregnant; he left her. Torn by
jealousy and under intense
pressure, Ruth Ellis shot him
five times, leaving none for
herself. She was hung three
months later, (the last woman
ever in this country) and
earned the name 'Breakneck'.
The film is dedicated to
authenticity. It c o u l d be
sensationalist, but it isn't. The
background of each character
is investigated in considerable
detail and is well balanced

depressive make-up of both

pose I've managed to date).
The film provides near
perfection in nearly every
respect. The photograph is a
t o w e r i n g a c h i e v e m e n t .
Shooting on location in the
craggy mountains and sun-
baked small towns of Spain,
Pasqualino De Santis instills a
sensation of space and depth
which creates a realism that
almost negates the theatr-
icality.
We observe Rosi's mastery
of the medium in the opening
scene. Here we witness the
foreplay and death of a bull in
the r i n g . T h e s c e n e is
mesmeric. Even as the bull
lowers his head to accept the
accurate blade of Escamillo
(the Matador) he demands
from you a respect and
recgnition of his dignity and

men in the triangle), but well
documented as it is, the film,
drags on, without any build up
of suspense or release from
the claustrophobic viewpoints
of the three characters.
Sadly , the film has done
little for the actors either.

worked extremely hard in
understanding Ellis' character
with only little experience in
TV work, this major break may
work against her in the public
eye. In contrast, Rupert

how it sickens to see such a
one; a. perfect conception,
brought to his knees, made
lifeless, a mass of still flesh.
Rosi gives you a real death.
The bull is not the only one
to give a fine (if farewell)
performance. Julia Migenes-

Don Jose. Small criticism.
What of the music? Well,
Rosi co-ordinates such an
intricate bonding between
Bizet's music and De Santis'
photography, one moment
Bizet provides the score then
at another the narative, some
later the score again. Quite
brilliant.
Francesco Rosi has created
something of a masterpiece.
