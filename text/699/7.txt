Imperial College Union elections are run by
the 'Single Transferable Vote' (STV) system.
What this essentially means is that as well
as being able to nominate your first choice
candidate you may also nominate your
second and your third and so on up to the
number of candidates standing. This means
that should your first choice candidate not
get many votes you may still be able to
influence the result with your second and
subsequent choices.
Things to remember when completing a
ballot paper.
1) If there are n candidates then you may
complete a sequence of numbers from 1 to n
placing one number against each candidate.
2) You need not complete the sequence up
to n but it must be unbroken and it must start
with 1.
3) No number may be repeated.
4) Any markings on the paper other than a
sequence of numbers beginning with 1 and
going up to n or less with no duplications will
invalidate the ballot paper.
5) There is no mention of Abstentions in
the voting schedule, however abstentions
will be recorded for information. Abstain by
writing ABSTAIN across the ballot paper.
