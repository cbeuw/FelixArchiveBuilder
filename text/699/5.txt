The Goethe
NEWS FEATURED
Yes, another week means another walk down Exhibition Road.
There are rumours that some IC students haven't even found
Exhibition Road yet, never mind the National Sound Archive or
the Mormon Chapel. Undaunted, this issue FELIX takes a look at
the Goethe Institute.
The Goethe Institute was
founded in 1951 with the aim of
promoting German language
and culture throughout the
world, and is modelled on similar
lines to the British Council. It is
largely funded by the West
G e r m a n G o v e r n m e n t , and
employs 3500 staff at 135
branches in 65 countries, one of
which is at 50 Princes Gate on
Exhibition Road.
There are many facilities of the
Institute that are of interest to
students at IC, especially because
many students have taken or are
taking German as an academic
subject, and do not want to lose
their skill through lack of use.
O Goethe-ln
Language Department
The Institute runs courses in
German at all levels. Some are at
very convenient times for
students, who also get a discount
on the course fee.
The Library
The Institute has a library of over
26,000 books which may be
borrowed by the public at no
charge, and these include classics
of German literature as well as
general reading. There are also
German periodicals, newspapers
and cuttings from the British
press about German affairs.

Nonsense in the
PopularPrint
Events
The Institute mounts events
aimed at encouraging and
spreading German culture. In
conjunction with the National
Film Theatre they are presenting
a series of German musicals of
the 30s and 40s starring Lillian
Harvey, and are helping with the
A l m e i d a Theatre's current
production of Man Equals Man
by Brecht. The many films they
show normally have subtitles in
E n g l i s h or s i m u l t a n e o u s
translation, and include the best
in German art films. Admission
for students is negligible
compared to the prices of a
trendy art cinema, for example
Hadrich's superb Der Stechlin is
being screened over the next
three Monday evenings (so you'll
have to hurry) and the price for
the entire four-and-a-half hours
is only 50p for students.
The Institute is careful not to
be seen as aggresively pushing
German and Germany, but an
awareness campaign is being
planned to raise its profile. Even
if you don't speak German and
feel that you can not afford the
time to learn, there is much at 50
Princes Gate that may be of
interest.
