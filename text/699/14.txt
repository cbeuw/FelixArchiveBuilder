LADIES CRICKET
Last Sunday Imperial College
Ladies Cricket team made their
Debut in a six-a-side tournament
at Hounslow Sports Centre. The
opposition was provided by the
four other clubs which make up
Middlesex Womens Cricket
Association.
Our batting was good, the
bowling even better, but despite
this, at the end of the day we still
lay in fifth place. The tournament
was held indoor and althoguh the
rules were far removed from the
traditional game, the team

Secretary, D Gallagher, Met and
Mat UG Junior Treasurer.
Many thanks to those
members who attended the
AGM and also helped make the
handicap knockout tournament
a success. The competition was
finally won by D Rhodes.
In the league the first team in
division two pulled off a good
victory by beating the top team 6-
3 while still occupying the bottom
space in the division. The second
team played away this week in a
room that passed as a dry sauna.
It being so hot that at some times
the ball was carried on a cushion
of hot air above the table, so
making a safe shot missed.
However they overcome these
problems with valour and won 7-
2. The third team again won so
steadily improving their position
in division five and may even
stand a chance of promotion.
The fourth team lost. The fifth
team haven't handed their
results in again!
improvised with a wide and
unusual repertoire of shots. All in
all a good day was had by
everyone and the experience
provided good preparation for
the oncoming season.
The team are holding practice
nets at Lord's indoor School
weekly until the end of term.

Geology ASAP. No experience

CYCLING
On Sunday 24 February the
college cycling club competed in
a 25 mile open 4-up team time
trial. The team consisted of Tony
Maschio, John Hayes, Martin
Farrow and Andrew Mason. The
time trial was organised by the
Severn RC and was held on a
course just North of Bristol on
the A38.
The team travailed to Bristol
by train on Saturday afternoon
and stayed the night at Martin's
house. (Many thanks to Martin's
parents for their hospitality).
By 10 o-clock on Sunday
morning the conditions were
practically perfect, no wind and
quite warm, Imperial started at
approximately 10.10am. The
team rode exceptionally well
together and covered the first
twelve and a half miles in 29
minutes. The final time was one
hour two minutes. The winning
team was Saracen RC with a
time of 56 minutes 11 seconds,
exceptional for the time of year.
If you would like to race or just
ride a bike in company you'll find
us in Southside Upper Lounge at
12.30 on Tuesdays. Alternatively
watch the notice board on the
JCR walkway for details of Club
runs and Training rides.
BOAT CLUB
In what is the largest woman's
Head event of the year with 66
competing crews, the Imperial
college Women's VIII came 26th.
They completed the course from
the University Stone, at
Chiswick Bridge to Hammer-
smith Bridge in a time of 13.06
minutes. The crew which
consisted of six novices did
exceptionally well beating
University of London by five
seconds and coming within 14
seconds of the more experien-
ced Reading University crew,
who are senior A. In the B
division, which is for crews
whose members have won no
more than one regatta each, they
finished fourth out of 25,
emphasising what a good race
the women's VIII had.
RCS SOCCER 6s
Despite adverse weather
conditions ten teams took the
field to do battle for the 1985
RCS six-a-side competition at
Harlington on Sunday. The
teams were split into two leagues
of five with the two top teams
qualifying for a play-off. In league
one Physical Wrecks and
Silwood edged out Physical
Chem PGs. The Sporting
Spastics did actually win a game
against Ferscht's Fliers but
unfortunately the Fliers flew half
way through the competition and
their results didn't count. League
two was dominated by Inorganic
Chem PGs and Mackers Men,
with the San Fran Briscow
Porkyrunner (SBP) putting in
some good performances. The
22-club, in between playing
rugby, and soccer for other
teams and drinking, managed to
win one game.

Games will be every Wednesday

week of the first term. The UAU
first round Games are on the first
and second Saturdays and the
second Wednesday of Term—
we play Southampton, Surrey
and Reading (two teams).
In the semi-finals the Physical
wrecks easily disposed of
Mackers Men; while a last
minute equaliser by Silwood
forced extra-time and penalties
against Inorg Chem PG's
Silwood won the shoot-out 3-2
(out of 5). Despite the gathering
gloom the final was a very
exciting game in front of a huge
crowd. Silwood took an early
lead but the Wrecks equalised in
the second-half. Good Goal-
keeping enabled Siiwood to hold
out against a lot of pressure
during extra-time and again
forced a penalty shoot-out. After
a glaring miss by one of IC's most
senior players the wrecks never
recovered and Silwood
triumphed 4-2.
Thanks to everybody who
refereed games and to all the
teams who turned up (and
stayed!). The beer prizes wer
certainly enjoyed by everyone.
