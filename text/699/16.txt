CNEWS
LIMB
A limbo dancer provided spectacular entertainment for those at
the 'Centenary Carnival' last Friday. Among the star performers
was poet John Cooper-Clarke.
The event was very enjoyable, said Ents supremo Dave Allen,
but he was disappointed with the low attendance.
In brief...
Only 250 students attended the
hustings U G M , the first
inquorate Hustings U G M for
many years. The first business
was the President's report, Ian
Bull making a verbal statement
on the new refectory proposals.
After the other officers' reports
were accepted the meeting moved
on to the hustings, with each
sabbatical candidate making a
speech and answering written
questions from the floor.
At the end, Dave Kingston, the
unopposed candidate for Deputy
President made a short speech of
acceptance.
RCS Rugby 1st team beat RSM
21—7 on Wednesday in the
Sparkes Cup Match, despite
being 7 points down at half-time.
The RCS 2nds had an even
better victory over their RSM
counterparts, beating them
31—4 with good, attacking
rugby.
The Budget could mean bad news
for students and parents if plans
go ahead to cut tax relief on
covenants.
Many students rely on deeds of
covenant for the parental
contribution to their grant. If a
taxpaying parent covenants £100
to their non-taxpaying child then
£30 can be claimed back from the
taxman. Every £100 covenanted
cost parents only £70, but is
worth £100 to the student.
Covenants signed up before
the Budget are likely to continue
to qualify for tax relief, although
there is no guarantee even for
this.
If you don't have a covenant
with your parents already, or if
you wish to change the amount,
then you should do so before
March 19.
In addition, if you have a
young brother or sister, then
your parents can make out a
covenant now, while the child is
under 18, and payments qualify
for relief as soon as 18 is reached.
The Inland Revenue produces
a standard form suitable for
student convenants (IR 47).
