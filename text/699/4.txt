Sub-standard
accommodation En vacances
Dear Sir,
I find it very hard to understand why
college officials are considering spending
thousands of pounds to improve the
aesthetics of the refectories (which many
students cannot afford to frequent anyway)
when a large proportion of college
administered a c c o m m o d a t i o n is
undisputedly sub-standard. The problem
with the old refectories is the food, not their
surroundings. I find it hard to believe that
moving the Site of cooking the food a few feet
closer to the serving area and installing new
chairs, tables, etc. will vastly improve its
quality!
Obviously a smart refectory serving 'good'
food would be a very conspicous asset to the
college, while spending money on student
accommodation would be appreciated by
students, but students only!
Yours faithfully,
P Barry

Look Back In Anger
The arrival of Look Back In Anger on the British
stage caused a sensation. Its depiction of a young
man, prepared to attack the establishment and
illustrate the uncomfortable truths concerning
Society.
Osborne, through the character of Jimmy Porter,
was speaking for a post-war generation living in an
apathetic,uncaring Society which was not prepared
to take notice of the 'angry young men' who felt
they had much to offer life.
The play is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s.
Dramsoc's memorable production of this excellent
play promises to be one of their best in recent
years. Tickets are available from IC Union Office,
Dramsoc storeroom or on the door.
Tickets £1.50
Friday 8 March 1985 FELIX
