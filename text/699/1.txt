QMCfooled in
ambush bluff
TwentyfiveQueen Mary College students were ambushed in Beit
Quad last Wednesday afternoon by a Guilds squad, in retaliation
for a recent QMC attack on an ICU minibus.
QMC were led to believe that
they would be taking part in a
joint raid with Chelsea College
on the IC Union Office.
The raid was planned on
Wednesday morning by C&GU.
Maribel Anderson, Guilds
President, rang QMC posing as
Amber Russel, Chelsea College
Rag Chairman. Maribel asked
QMC what time the raid would
take place and was told that no
details had been finalized but
that QMC would ring her back.
She gave a phone number which
would not accept incoming calls.
Guilds then rang Chelsea,
pretending to be QMC, saying
that if QMC phoned to ask about
a rag stunt at IC, it would really
be Imperial trying to gather
information to enable them to
block the raid, and therefore they
should be told nothing.
About 25 QMC students met a
Guilds contingent in South
Kensington. Guilds, now
pretending to be from Chelsea,
lured QMC to Beit Quad.
The Joint party stormed into
the Quad and did not notice that
the gates were locked behind
them.
They ran towards the Union
Office and were taken into one of
the rooms which was meant to
trap them. It was here that the
true identity of the 'Chelsea'
students was revealed and the
squad were joined by about 30
other Imperial students for a
flan, water and flour fight in Beit
Quad.
This included participants
being sprayed with water from
hosepipes located on the roof of
Beit Hall. Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith,
Union Clerk, also joined in the
attack by throwing jug-fulls of
water out of the Union Office
window, allegedly shouting
'Come on duckies, let's get the
rotters!'.
The original plan was to
kidnap a QMC student, when the
rest of the QMC team found the
gates locked, they threatened
violence and were later allowed
to leave covered in treacle, foam,
water and contents of dustbins.
No permanent damage was
done to Beit Quad and no one
was injured. The whole area was
later sprayed down with hose-
pipes.
College Security Officer,
Geoffrey Reeves, who accidently
walked in on the raid treated the
whole incident very light-
heartedly and described it as just
a bit of fun. He said that 'this is
what you expect when you steal
someone's mascot'.
•The minibus, that was last week
immobilized by QMC, was
recovered using spare wheels.
The original wheels and some
rugby kits have not been returned
and the police have been
informed and are investigating
the matter. Mary, the QMC
mascot, is still in the possesssion
of RCSU and its return will not
• be considered until the return of
the wheels.

Centenary week
r
a success'
'Centenary Week went
tremendously and was a
complete success', according to
Professor Sayers, Dean of the
City and Guilds College. He also
said that he would look
sympathetically on the loss
incurred by the City and Guilds
Union following the Masquerade
Ball. This poorly attended event
lost at least £500. Professor
Sayers said that he was pleased at
the enthusiasm shown by some
students to act as part of the team
showing visitors around College.
The symposium and exhibition
had together impressed industry
and the University Grants
Committee had portrayed the
College as an elite institution.
From a financial viewpoint the
College has profited as several
major research contracts are
being discussed as a result of Tech
2000 and it is thought that the
contract return will pay for the
cost of setting up the exhibition.
During the open days over
2000 school children visited the
C&G departments and Tech
2000.
The symposium, held last
Wednesday attracted about 200
guests and 250 staff and students.
The presentations are to be
turned into a book together with
some specially commissioned
chapters on '21st Century
Technology'. It is expected to be
published later on this year.
