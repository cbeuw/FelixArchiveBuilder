OBITUARY
Ian Munro
Professor John Munro
John Munro died suddenly on
Wednesday 27 February, aged
56. He was Professor of Civil
Engineering Systems and had
been Head of the Civil
Engineering Department since
1982. His premature death comes
as a bitter blow to all those who
knew him, were taught by him or
who worked with him. Ian—he
was known to us all as Ian, not
John—was a source of
inspiration whose presence will
be sorely missed. Above all, he
was a truly kind and fair man; no
problem was too small or too
large for him; Ian's door was ever
open.
Ian came to the Civil
Engineering Department in 1955
from Ove Arup and Partners to
undertake the Concrete
postgraduate course. This was
followed by research on
cylindrical shell structures and
then appointment as Lecturer in
1957, Senior Lecturer in 1967,
Reader in Civil Engineering
Systems in 1974 and Professor in
1980. Ian's teaching and research
activities were wide-ranging and
enthusiastically pursued
throughout his life. Whilst most
researchers are content to apply
themselves to a single main topic
of research, Ian's considerable
talents enriched three distinct
areas: shell structures, frame
structures and civil engineering
sytems. His research displayed an
uncommon elegance, starting
from his use of the Goldenveizer
Static-Kinematic Analogy in
shell structures and leading
ultimately to the principle of

Static-Kinematic Duality in
structural mechanics. This in
turn was explored via
mathematical programming
where once again Duality theory
gave expression to existing and
new structural theorems.
In the 1960's Ian also became
interested in areas apparently
remote from civil engineering—
Claude Shannon's Theory of
Communication and Statistical
Entropy, Statistical Decision
Analysis and Zadeh's Fuzzy Set
Theory. (He also gave a course
on computing before the College
or University had any digital
computers!). From this stemmed
his interest in Systems
Engineering and in 1971 the
Systems and Mechanics Section
was established under his
headship.
Quick to identify completely
new and fruitful areas of civil
engineering research he had
encouraged the use of Expert
Systems and logic programming
within the Department. Just
prior to his death he had
established a laboratory for
Expert Systems applied to civil
engineering to co-ordinate
research in areas as diverse as
mechanics, pre-stressed concrete
design, coastal engineering,
public health and water resource
engineering and transport.
Since assuming the Headship
of the Department, Ian initiated
a radical improvement of the
Department's computing
facilities, particularly for
undergraduate teaching. A
centenary history of the
Department he was proud to
have served for thirty years was
published on the day he died.
Page 101 states 'The start of
Munro's headship has thus
shown him to be eager to equip
the Department to take full
advantage of modern tech-
nology. He has also exhibited
concern about the details of every
aspect of the Department's work
drawing upon apparently
inexhaustible reserves of energy
and enthusiasm. We look
forward to a productive period
under his Leadership'. Sadly his
reserves were too quickly
consumed for us all. His dear
wife Dorothe recalls that Ian had
often been advised to cut down
the amount of teaching he did.
'No, that's what I enjoy most',
was his reply.
Our deepest sympathy is
extended to Dorothe, daughter
Lisa and son Neil.
