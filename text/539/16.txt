POWER
No country should be without one —
according to history anyway. History
might not repeat itself, but some of us
surely do. Russia's military involvement
in Afghanistan comprises several strug-
gles; not only is there the underlying
theme of Soviet global expansion, but
also America's problematic role in world
affairs, the rise of Islam and the constant
battle for prestige. Russia's plans for
expansion are no news to anybody;
twenty years of Fidel Castro's regime in
C u b a have already passed, a prime
example of Soviet political investment.
But this time her intervention has
smashed hopes for an East-West detente
and caused S A L T - 2 (Strategic A r m s
L i m i t a t i o n s T a l k s ) to be s h e l v e d .
However, it may be that her hasty actions
which caught America napping, were not
solely for reasons of aggrandizement.
Islamic fervour has been mounting in
Afghanistan and consequently poses a
threat to Russia's control over her
southern-most territories which contain a
large Moslem population. There are signs
of an anxious Russia preparing for a long
campaign, to avoid the sort of humiliation
that A m e r i c a suffered through Iran.
Prestige is all-important in world affairs,
especially for a nation that wants control
of her satellite states.
America is heading right back the other
way, her public pressing more and more
for policies of isolation. Carter has sent
military aid to Pakistan which borders
Afghanistan, and may be making over-
tures to China, but his action against
Russia has been a series of withdrawals,
albeit at his p e r s o n a l e x p e n s e in
America's coming elections — no grain,
no technology, no consulates-general and
possibly no Olympics. America is getting
out; it remains to be seen if she will
adequately protect her interests in the
Middle East. Meanwhile back in Russia,
someone in Politburo has itchy fingers.
The decision of Afghanistan must have
been made with prior knowledge of both
the factors involved and the retaliation
that might be expected. The American
grown sanction will hit hard, with both
long and short term effects; heavy-handed
action in crushing resistance in Afghan-
istan will only feed the fire of Islam and
c o m b i n i n g this with f r a t e r n i z a t i o n
between America and China makes for a
nasty headache. What started out as a
struggle for power, may end up as a lot of
domestic problems for all concerned.
Pakistan does not only border o n
Afghanistan; it also lies along the northern
boundaries of India, where the political
fortunes of the redoubtable Mrs Gandhi
have taken a sudden turn for the better.
Having swept all opposition before her in
the recent elections, she has been chosen
by Indian populace to form a new
government, a shock decision in view of
her totalitarian emergency rule three
years ago. The fundamental truth is that
she has been give"n a second chance,
because of the worthlessness of the
Janata government of the last few years
and by her skilful and unscrupulous
opportunism. Her careful electioneering
on. the economic failures of the last
government has proved successful, but an
odour of nepotism lingers; Mrs Gandhi's
son, Sanjay, has been returned as an M P
with rumours of a post in his mother's
g o v e r n m e n t , w h i c h is p e r t u r b i n g ,
considering his past r e c o r d , which
includes the unpleasant affair of the
compulsory sterilization programme. The
facile suggestion that India went to the
polls to choose the lesser of two evils
might stand, but what follows now must
surely be a period of political probation.
Technically both mother and son are
open to indictment for various offences
relating to Mrs Gandhi's earlier rule; it
can only be hoped that such action will
be rendered untenable by a ministry with
clear-headed and economically viable

In the election of 1977, Mrs Gandhi was
defeated and cast aside ignominiously by
a handful of old politicians who combined
against her on a single platform. T h e
election which was intended as the
people's stamp on autocracy thrust Mrs
Gandhi into oblivion. Y e t only thirty
months after this Mrs Gandhi has swept
back to power with a two-thirds majority.
Whatever else this is a tremendous
a c h i e v e m e n t a n d a t r i b u t e to M r s
Gandhi's courage and belief.
The Janata party instead of using its
office to expose the sordid side of the
e m e r g e n c y or d e v e l o p a c o h e r e n t
conservative philosophy for modern India
spent its time in perpetual bickering. The
electorate disillusioned by this rallied
round M r s Ghandi.
Mrs Gandhi fought the election on two
main issues: to provide economic stability
a n d law a n d o r d e r . S h e p r o m i s e d
discipline and a strong government.
One of the questions on people's minds
is whether her son, Sanjay Ghandi, will be
given a place in the cabinet or whether he
will simply be involved in party work.
COMMUNIST SOCIETY
A F G H A N I S T A N
The recent events in Afghanistan
have been tragic ones; both for the
s t r u g g l e of t h e A f g h a n p e o p l e for
national i n d e p e n d e n c e a n d for t h e
future of world peace. Most members
of Communist Society would second
the sentiments condemning the Soviet
action, expressed in the Morning Star
Editorial (31/12/79) " M r Karmal, the
new leader of the government in Kabul
a p p e a r s to f a v o u r a c o n c i l i a t o r y
approach toward the Islamic groups
and that is said to have been the
advice which the Soviet Union has
given all along. S u c h an approach
may very well be correct. What is
wrong is the use of foreign military
force to bring in a new government to
follow such policies. For there are
wider implications.
T h o u g h n o o n e d e n i e s that M r
Karmal asked for military assistance, it
is by no means clear that he was
entitled to d o so as the established
power in Afghanistan.
This is where the issue impinges on
the principle of non-interference in
o t h e r c o u n t r i e s . T h i s p r i n c i p l e is
central to the struggle for world peace
and disarmament so crucial at the
Sanjay was involved in the controversial
family planning programme (being linked
with the unsavoury forced sterilization)
and was accused of corruption. Whether
he is in the Cabinet or not he will be
nearer the centre than a n y holding
ministerial posts.
With Mrs Gandhi's two thirds majority
she can change the constitution, if she so
desires. In future there will probably be
states as Mrs Gandhi will continue the
trend to centralize the power. She might
change the system to one where there is
a presidential executor, as in France or
the United States. Opposition to this will
c o m e from both inside and outside
Parliament. M r s G a n d h i has a large
majority in the Lower House. In the
'Upper House, where the members are
elected by the State assemblies. Things
could be very different as the State
asemblies are very much in tune with
what happened during the emergency.
Outside Parliament there will be opposi-
tion by the Trade Unionists, who are led
by politicians and better organised than in
1977, which could make things rough.
Mrs G a n d h i will face considerable
problems once she is back in office.
India is one of the top twelve industrial
nations and produces everything from
drugs to digital watches. T h e home
industry is protected by keeping a tight
check on imports. There is however little
stability: the rising cost of crude oil and
labour unrest are major problems. India
has a power shortage even though there
is plenty of coal because railway strikes
have prevented the coal being trans-
ported to where it is needed. Inflation is
at 20%. India faces the worst drought in
living memory and has a huge deficit of
more than double that estimated.
It looks as if the next few years in India
are going to be pretty turbulent.
