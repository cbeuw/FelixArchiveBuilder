REFECTORY COMPLAINTS A N D
SUGGESTIONS
Boxes in each refectory outlet are for your
comments on the nature of the food, the
price structure, and the serviece. Whilst the
Union doesn't control any of these outlets
we do have a say in the way they should be
organised. Thus pass on your views to your
representatives (via the boxes). Any note
containing a name and department will be
replied to informing you of the response to
your comment. O n e point I would add: If
your complaint is with the quality of your
dish T A K E I T B A C K and only then, if you
are still not satisfied put a note in the box.
RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS

THIRD WORLD SCHOLARSHIP
I've been saddened that to date the amount
raised for this is only £1,000 and that
includes collections we have made outside
college.
We will shortly be selling T W S badges for
50p. Let's do something good for once
CLUBS A N D SOCIETIES
If you're in a club or society, and particularly
if you're expecting to hear something about
an event you've arranged, then keep your
ear open in the Union Building for any
announcements made over the intercom.
There's often a lot of trouble with clubs who
must know they are due to be contacted
over some alternation to a fixture and yet
nobody ever seems to be around to hear the
calls made over the intercom.
PUBLICITY
Once again this subject rears its ugly head.
I'm just going to remind everybody of Rule
(7) of the publicity rules which states: " A l l
publicity shall contain the date of the event
being publicised and the name of the body
organising the event in E N G L I S H . " This'
applies particularly to some of the overseas
students' societies who continually break
this rule. I'll just reiterate that all posters
breaking the rules will be taken down and
made the people responsible liable to a fine.
Also posters affixed to walls can only be
stuck on with Blu Tac not sellotape.
NIGHTLINE
"Someone to talk to" is at 10 Princes
Gardens. Internal 2468 or 581 2468.
WHAT HAPPENS A T A U G M
The order of things follows the agenda, which
usually has the format:
1. M i n u t e s of lasting meeting: Copies of the
minutes of the last meeting are issued to
everybody which everybody can check as a 'true
and accurate record'.
2. Officers Reports: Officers present reports of
what they've been doing so that you can check
that they are doing their job properly — according
to their job description and following any specific
instructions that have been requested by
previous U G M s .
Once a report has been presented people are
free to question anything they do not understand
or make a request to enlarge upon a particular
section. Questions are always invited to a report.
If you are not satisfied with a report because
you feel an officer has not acted correctly or
because it is insufficient, then, you can move that
it be 'referred back'. This means that the U G M is
dissatisfied with the action or lack of it taken by
that officer.
M O T I O N S
Once the reports are out of the way, what is
usually the most controversial part of the meeting
starts — the motions. These can and do refer to
almost anything — external and internal to the
college. How they are dealt with is defined strictly
in the standing orders. Anybody can propose one
of these to a Union meeting as long as he/she can
find a seconder, as long as they do it at least
seven days before the U G M , after that they
appear at the chair person's discretions.
A proposal speech comes first, after that
amendments are taken. Again anybody can
propose an amendment, and if there are no
further rounds of speeches a vote.
If the amendment is defeated
everybody forgets about it. Either way we now
move onto the next amendment (only one
amendment can be discussed at a time) and so on
Until all amendments are dealt with (or until a
move to vote is passed). There is then usually a
speech against; a summing up speech for; after
which a vote is immediately taken on the main
motion, which if it is passed becomes Union
policy.
Any motion can be passed as long as it does not
c o n t r a d i c t the B y e - L a w s ( I C U n i o n ' s
constitution) or the standing orders.
