INTERNATIONAL
SUPERSTARS
The Imperial College Ladies Rugby
Team have become the most famous
Ladies Rugby Team in the World. Last
Thursday, C B S Television News filmed
their practice seesion in Hyde Park. The
B B C will be filming a match for
Nationwide. The Daily Telegraph gave
them a half page feature and it is
expected that the Ladies will appear in
this Friday's Express. Next Thursday a
Radio programme will be recorded that
may be transmitted on the World
Service.
FELIX began the publicity last term
and since then the international media
have given extensive coverage to the
Ladies. The reason for the American
interest is because the U S A is going
through a Nationwide keep fit craze.
