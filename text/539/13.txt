This Sunday at 5pm Focus Live features City
Boy recorded in the Great Hall on 5th October
1976. City Boy, who were originally a
Birmingham based folk / harmony group,
presented a six piece line up at the gig, and played
a magnificent set. Since giving the concert they
have had two singles in the charts: '5.7.0.5'in July
1978 and the follow up ' O h What a Night' in
November.
Despite rumours that they may be splitting up,
they are expected to be recording a new album in
the next couple of months, after their current
Europoean tour and they hope to be touring the
U.K. in August this year.
