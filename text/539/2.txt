O n Monday the station Manager of IC
Radio, Harvey Nadin, resigned. Jon Firth has
become Acting Station Manager.
In a special interview, with the Editor of
FELIX, Harvey explained that he wanted to
devote more time to academic work.
Harvey said that he had not been able to
properly revise for his exams, last December.
His results had been affected by the amount of
time that he had to spend managing the Radio
Station. Harvey hoped that IC Radio will grow
from strength to strength over the next five
years and he still intends to contribute to the
station.

PRESENT
GIANT CAKE
TO CHILDREN
Larry Stove, the head chef, of the
Kensington Palace hotel baked a cake for the
Mines raffle. The President of Mines, Bernie
Pryor, decided that the cake was too good to
decorate any one person's Christmas table
and so he presented it to the Gt. Ormond
Street Children's hospital.
The children enjoyed their surprise
Christmas feast and so did the staff. The
FELIX reporter noted that the cake had
been laced with alcohol. The Catering
Manager said that the amount of Christmas
Spirits in each slice would not harm the
children.
