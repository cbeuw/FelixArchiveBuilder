There's a great deal we could say about your future at Software
Sciences.
We could tell you what it is that makes the company one of the leading
European consultancy and systems implementation organisations.
We could describe some of the many hundreds of major computing
projects, covering everything from banking and space research to
newspaper production and brewing, on which our staff have worked.
We could remind you that in this type of work it's the personal skill
and ability of the individual which really counts.
We could mention that our staff are involved in almost every aspect
of computing and with every type of computer.
We could draw your attention to the openings provided by our
offices throughout the UK, Continental Europe, and in the US.
We could comment on the quality of training which all our graduates
receive.
We could note that since our future depends on your personal
success we must pursue a really positive aproach to career
development.
And we could point out that this combination of opportunity, job
satisfaction, variety of experience, and personal development is
something which few companies in the industry can offer.
But since there isn't room to tell the whole story, we've
put it down in our graduate recruitment brochure
'Why Software Sciences'.
If you are looking for a career in
computing, we think that it will tell
you everything you want to know
