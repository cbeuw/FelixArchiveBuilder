"LAST YEAR'S THING"
Happy 1980s to all ICUists and anyone
else reading this. I hope that the anguish
after the orphaned goslings Christmas
Gander created isn't worrying you too
much.
Contrary to c o m m o n belief this term is not <
going to be void, there's lots to look
forward too, vis.
WELFARE DAY
O n Wednesday 13th February — In which
the finer points will be highlighted with
stalls and things in the J C R , probably
accompanied by an all day bar, and some
novelty acts, like sex films!
OVERSEAS STUDENTS FAIR
A week later — This is going to be
organised by O S C and again will be in the
J C R . Indian food can be washed down by
Greek Ouzo or French Wine. An excellent
opportunity to taste the custom as well as the
foods of the societies in O S C .
Also of course the elections will soon be
upon us. That's when I become a has-been
before I have been! A l l I would like to say
is that anyone considering a post should
not hesitate to see myself or other relevant
persons to get a full job description, and
can rely on confidentiality from me. T o
underline the point made to me by one or
two friends that I spend too m u c h time in
the U n i o n Bar, I would like to agree and
suggest that all c a n d i d a t e s for p o s t s
should be teetotal, or at least do their
drinking where no one else can see them!
(Which just about covers my N e w Year's
Resolution).
M i c h a e l A r t h u r ' s brief has s o m e w h a t
changed of late, his new role taking him
out of the Centre more. T o cover for this
and further expand the scope of the
centre a part-time assistant, Susan Telling,
has been appointed over the holidays. I
wish her a happy stay here.
Also over the holidays I prepared a paper
on cutting and streamlining the oh-so
confusing I C U committee structure. I
hope that when it finally sees the light of
day that it stimulates action as well as
discussion and hysteria.
ESTIMATES
These must be prepared as soon as poss,
so if your major sub-committee hasn't
contacted you about them it's because
you didn't pick up the mail or the 'infernal'
mail didn't deliver it. G e t cracking.
So I can go back to putting my new velvet
jacket on and taking it off again and you
can go back to Q u a n t u m Mechanics safe
in the knowledge that the quality of the
F O X articles have not improved over the
Christmas break.

J U S T A S E C
Welcome back and I hope you had a
m a r v e l l o u s C h r i s t m a s a n d N e w Y e a r .
This week's H o n Sec article is somewhat
long' but full of dates and information.
UGMs
There are four meetings this term (one
being largely devoted to the sabbatical
elections). Please make a note of the
dates. They are: Tuesday 22nd January,
T u e s d a y 5 t h F e b r u a r y , T h u r s d a y 6th
M a r c h ( H u s t i n g s ) a n d T h u r s d a y 13th
M a r c h (Results and Officers' Elections).
All the meetings are held at 1:00pm in the
Great Hall. After the article is an account
of how the meetings are conducted which
I do urge you strongly to read. It would
be good to see new faces turning up
(relative to other Universities we already
h a v e a g o o d a n d r e p r e s e n t a t i v e
attendance) and more people handing in
motions. This is why I've put up those
p o s t e r s a r o u n d t h e c a m p u s . T h e
deadline for motions, which have to be
submitted to me, is seven days prior to a
U G M .
LIBRARY
If you didn't know, i he Haldane Library (just
by the entrance to • ne Great Hall) stocks an
excellent selectic or books mainly fiction
and non-scientifii:. records, classical and an
excellent selection of pop and jazz. T h e
point is that two students buy all the non-
classical records and fiction and what they
go on are the actual suggestions put in to the
library on their suggestion cards. S o if you
want to borrow a particular b o o k / r e c o r d
and it's not in there, suggest it and there's a
very good chance it will be bought. S o if you
don't like the selection — change it!
PWP M E M B E R
Foiiowing the resignation of Colin Palmer as
a P W P ordinary member, the papers went
up for this post on Tuesday and shall come
down on Thursday 17th January (voting to
be at the U G M on 22nd January). If you
wish sit on this working party committee
and nence on C o u n c i l find out what it entails
first and tnen you'll need a proposer and ten
seconders. Paoers are situated in the L o w e r
Lounge.
NUS
C O M M I T T E E S
A n i m p o r t a n t p o i n t is that all U n i o n
Committees are open. A s one person
who sits on all these it seems that there
is one sitting all the time. If you wish to
attend one you are perfectly able to. A s
they are not often adverised, times etc
can be obtained from me.
T h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t c o m m i t t e e is
C o u n c i l w h i c h has v e s t e d in it the
"management of the Union". It is to
Council that all officers must report and
hence there is a check on the work of the
s u b c o m m i t t e e s . D a t e s of t h i s t e r m s
Councils are: M o n d a y 28th January in
S C R , M o n d a y 25th February in S C R and
M o n d a y 17th M a r c h in Siiwood Field
Station. They are all held at 6:00pm.
UNION OFFICE
The effective centre of all College life is the
Union Office. In case you aren't sure where
that is, I'll tell you: A s you enter the Beit
Quadrangle, through the archway, then
opposite you across the Q u a d is the heaven
on earth of the U n i o n Building containing all
sorts of wonder (Yes! even Space Invaders).
The U n i o n Office is via the Entrance at the
right hand of the building and is found on the
first floor.
Here you can book a r o o m , book a van, grab
details of clubs and societies, book for a hall
dinner etc. N o w we come to the
inhabitants....God created A d a m and Eve,
but more importantly the three U n i o n
Office permanent staff and the three full-
time Student Officers: Chris F o x , M a l c o l m
Brain and myself, Roger Stotesbury. W e
share the responsibility for all the areas of
the Union's work, so please do not hesitate
to c o m e and chat to us.
Last term I had many querries as to why
Imperial College U n i o n is not in N U S . T o
put the matter into perspective I include
here a section from F E L I X dated 17th
November 1978 giving the results of a
campus-wide referendum called for by a
U G M :
In an enormous poll last
Frid • •moerial college
Sru- .'-.ton decided not to
reaftuici: to the National
Union a ttadents.
i he re^rendum was held as
a college : :iae ballot with ballot
boxes in each department and
one ser,; to Suwood. Over two
tnousand five hundred people
voted: the largest turnout for
some considerable time, made
even more impressive by the
fact that the ballot onlv took
place on one day. The final
figures were:
140*: against re-affiliation,
1058 m ravour of affiliating,
St- ciostentions and
2 sooiir paoers.
It became clear4
before the
end of the count that the
majority aeasion was against
affiliation: the two boxes on the
Environment Technology and
Geo/ocv field trips had no
effect on tne result.
Thus the decision not to reaffiliate was
taken last academic year, two years after we
vorea to pull out. with a massive poll of over
2,500 members.
D U R E X
In case you ever have call to purchase a
sheath, et me tell you there is a D u r e x
machine in the mens' toilets in the U n i o n
Buiiding. (continued on next page)
