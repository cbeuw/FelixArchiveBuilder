the Mirror Dinghy World Championships in Perth, Australia, last

Although he only started sailing five years ago, he has also won
the U K and European Championships. Dave flew home last

publish an interview with Dave next Friday.
FELIX CARTOONIST
WINS AWARD
Paul Williams, the creator of Drake's Seven, has won £100 in a
student newspaper competition organised by the Daily Express.
Sheffield's student newspaper, Dart won the main prize. Peter
Horrocks was top reporter and Stephen Mackey was voted best
feature writer. Photographer of the year was Julian Law.
This year's FELIX will be entered in the 1980 competition and
we have hopes that Paul Williams will win again for Imperial and
that we could win other prizes.

PRESS
We would like to apologise to
readers for having to bring
FELIX out on Monday. Prob-
lems with the printing press
and other difficulties with
p r o d u c t i o n meant that we
could not issue F E L I X last
Friday. The old press is to be
given a thorough maintenance
today but the size of FELIX
may only be twelve pages next
Friday.
E X P R E S S
On Friday 11th January the
Daily Express featured the
Ladies Rugby Team. Barbara
Ions (the Happy Hooker) woke
up to find herself pictured on
page seven.
The article was written in a
style typical of the Express.
The ladies were not pleased
with the item and the Editor of
FELIX would lik» to apologise
to the team for any embar-
rassment caused. Radio Four
discussed the article on Friday
morning as part of the contin-
uing interest shown in the
Ladies Rugby T e a m by the
international media. -
