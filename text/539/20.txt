COME ON IN
the water's lovely
Well, if you are managing to keep your
food down again, after New Year's Eve,
perhaps (in a vague, theoretical way, of
course), you will be interested in the
activities in College this term.
The main H A M S O C occurrence (Yes,
I'm sorry — we're still here) this term is
the Radio Amateur's Exam couse that
we will be running on Wednesdays, from
about 1:00 onwards in Elec Eng 1207.
Sessions will consist of a short talk (if
anyone wants it — There is little point in
rattling on for ages about Ohm's Law to
a group of Post Doctorate Electrical
Engineers. O n the other hand, people at
any standard are welcome and whoever
wants Ohm's Law will get it!) followed by
Questions and Answers, in which you
ask the questions and the "teacher" is
unable to give the answers.
Anyone who wants to learn a bit about
radio is very welcome to come along,
whether they intend to take the exam or
not. A pass qualifies you a radio
transmitting license.
A listing of the talks is printed out
below. They are of course F R E E , but if
you would like a set of printed notes, we
will have to c h a r g e to recover
duplicating costs.

12th Tackling the R A E .
O n a lighter note, entertainments this
term include a private tour to the
Science Museum transmitting station
(please bring yourown jemmy and black
boot polish). This will give us an
excellent opportunity to look at worn out
old equipment used by the first
generation of radio amateurs. Rather
like an afternoon in the shack, really.
According to Russell, they have some
excellent examples of the stone-age
forbear of the modern monolithic
microchip: megalithic macrochips (but I
wouldn't take him too seriously if I were
you — I don't think they could get
Stonehenge up the escalators).
Also on this term's menu is a talk on
satellite communications, and of course
your valiant committee is working round
the clock to fix up other thrills for your
delectation, so keep half an eye on your
letter rack, half on the "What's O n "
column and half on the rest of FELIX,
and you'll not miss out.
See you up in the Shack,
73's for now,

CANOE CLUB
Last term Canoe Club had three very
successful weekend trips. The first to
the River Wye was primarily for the new
paddlers in the club, but one stretch was
also paddled by the members with some
experience. The trip was well supported
a n d m a n y n e w m e m b e r s w e r e
encouraged by their success.
The second to the River Usk was
slightly disappointing due to the lack of
water, but good weather meant that we
were able to spend more time on the
water than normal.
We ended the term with a surfing trip
to Bude. We were fortunate to have
some sun while paddling, although it
rained for most of the rest of the time.
Those surfing for the first time soon got
the hang of it, and everyone thoroughly
enjoyed themselves in the excellent surf.
For this term the first trip is on the 26th
and 27th of January to the River Dart, a
river we are not able to visit frequently,
so a trip not to be missed. We hope to
have a second triver trin in mid-
February. The final trip will be to Bude
on the 8th and 9th of March. It is also
hoped some Saturday trips will be
arranged to Shepperton Werr. Finally do
not forget the pool sessions on Tuesday
evenings (6:30—8:00) in the swimming
pool and Stan's Bar after 8:30.

IC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER
CLUB
Both tables have now been recov-
ered and the 'B' table has had new
c u s h i o n r u b b e r s installed. I w o u l d
advise all members to book a period
as soon as possible: There's nothing
nicer than to play on a new, silky,
pure wool cloth. It would be nice to
keep the cloth in this condition: on the
part of the committee, we will 'brush
the tables every day and mow them
twice a week; for your part, please
c o v e r t h e t a b l e w h e n y o u h a v e
f i n i s h e d , a n d p l e a s e refrain f r o m
smoking over the table, or placing
glasses on it.
At present the 'A', 'B', and ' C teams
are first, third and second respectively
in the league.
We have three trips p l a n n e d for
February:
1. B e n s o n a n d H e d g e s M a s t e r s ,
Wembley, 5th—9th February.
2. UK Professional Billiards C h a m p i -
ons Leeds 10th—17th February.
3. British G o l d C u p , Derby, 24th—29th
February.
If you would like to go to any of
these, please come and see me before
Wednesday, 1:00pm. We should have
fixed the dates by today.
We are now accepting entries for
the Open and Handicap Tournaments.
These are the two major tournaments
of the Club. The entrance fee for the
Open will be 10p and for the Handicap
25p (members only). The maximum
handicap will be about 55, and the
winner will have use of a pot in the
Union Bar. Closing date will be next
Friday at 3:00pm.
This is the election term, so if you
are i n t e r e s t e d in s t a n d i n g for a
committee post, please come and see
us. A final word: Please make use of
the snooker tables in the U L U Build-
ing in the Malet Street.
