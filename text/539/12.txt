Islam ( s u b m i s s i o n to G o d )
establishes not only peace and
harmony but also rids mankind of
t y r a n n y a n d o p p r e s s i o n . T h e
contemporary world presents in
this respect no better view than it
did fourteen hundred years ago,
when Islam freed it from all false
gods. Tyranny still on the rampage
in the guise of haughty kings,
insolent demagogues and heartless
capitalists who are busy in sucking
the blood of millions, subjugating
them and making capital out of
their helplessness a n d misery.
T h e r e is still a n o t h e r class of
dictators who rule with sword,
usurp peoples' liberties and claim
that they are merely instruments in
enforcing the p e o p l e ' s or the
proletariat's will.

Islam brings to an end man's rule
over man. It makes the rulers as
much subject tot Divine Law as are
all other men and women. Islam
does not allow any man to sub-
jugate others or impose upon them
his will. Only God's commands are
to be obeyed and only the exam-
ples of the Prophets are to be
followed. T h e ruler, in such a
community, shall, as a part of his
obligations towards men and G o d ,
be required to enforce Divine Law
failing which he may no longer
have any lawful claim to people's
obedience. They may in such a
situation quite lawfully disregard his
orders. This was explicitly stated
by the first Caliph Abu Bakr (May
G o d be pleased with him) when he
said that " Obey me only so long
as I obey G o d with respect to you;
and if I should happen to deviate
from God's obedience, then in that
case my obedience shall no longer
be incumbent upon you." As such
the ruler in Islam has no privileged
right to use the Public Exchequer
or to formulate state legislation in
defiance to the Shari'ah. Moreover
it is only the trustworthy people
who have any right to rule, who
elected to a post of authority
through a free, just and impartial
election with no checks on voters
save those of justice, virtue and
decency.
Such an Islamic State will not
only liberate its citizens from all
tyrants at home but shall safeguard
their freedom against any outside
a g g r e s s i o n as well. T h i s is so
because Islam itself is a religion of
glory and power and as such it
cannot tolerate that men should
degrade themselves by prostrating
at the feet of the false god of
Imperialism, Islam prescribes a very
simple code of life for man. It
exhorts him to strive hard to gain
pleasure of his Creator, surrender
his will to that of his Lord, follow
H i s c o m m a n d m e n t s a n d c o m e
forward with all the sources at his
disposal to fight against the spectre
of Imperialism and tyranny.
Let Man therefore turn towards
Islam for this is the time for all
human beings to flock together
under its banner so as to wipe out
from the face of the earth all the
vestiges of Imperialism and exploi-
tation of man by man. Here is the
way to real freedom, one which
allows no serfdom, promises all
men freedom in thought, action,
property and religion, jealously
safeguarding their integrity as well
as honour.

ISLAMIC R E V I V A L
It must be well understood that
Islam is not a mere ideological
vision. It is a practical system of life
that fully a p p r e c i a t e s all the
genuine needs of mankind and tries
to realize them.
In trying to meet the genuine
requirements of man Islam effects a
perfect balance between all areas
of life and activity. It starts with the
individual maintaining a balance
between his requirements of body
and soul, reason and spirit and in
no case allows one side to pre-
dominate the other. It does not |
suppress the animal insticts in
order to make the soul ascend the
higher planes, nor does it allow
man, in his efforts to fulfil his bodily
desires, to stoop down to the low
level of animalism and hedonism.
O n the contrary, it makes them
both meet on a single higher plane
doing away with all the internal
psychological conflicts that the
human soul is threaten by or set a
part of it against the other parts. In
the social sphere, it proceeds to
achieve an equilibrium between the
needs of the individual and those of
the community. It does not allow
an idividual to transgreess against
other individuals, or against the
community. Nor does it allow the
community to comit transgression
against the individual. It also does
not approve of one class or group
of people to enslave another class
or group of people. Islam exercises
a beneficient constraint on all these
mutually opposed forces, prevents
them from coming into colision
with one another, and harnesses
them all to co-operate for the
general good of m a n k i n d as a
whole.
Islam strikes a balance between
different sectors of society and
b e t w e e n d i f f e r e n t a s p e c t s of
e x i s t e n c e , spiritual as well as
material. Unlike Communism, it
does not believe that economic
factors, ie the material aspect
alone, dominate the human exist-
ence. Nor does it contribute to
what the p u r e spiritualists or
idealists say claiming that spiritual
factors or high ideals alone are
sufficient to organize human life.
Islam rather holds that all these
diverse elements put together form
what is called human society; and
that the best code of life is that
which takes note of all these,
making full allowance for body as
well as r e a s o n a n d spirit a n d
arranging them all in the frame-
work of a h a r m o n i o u s whole.
Thirdly, it must always be kept in
mind that Islam has an altogether
independent existence of its own as
a social philosophy as well as an
economic system. S o m e of its
outward manifestations may on the
surface appear to resemble those
of Capitalism and Socialism, but in
fact it is far from being the one or
the other. It retains all the good
characteristics of these systems,
yet is free from their shortcomings
and perversions. It does not extol
individualism to that loathful extent
which is the characteristic of the
modern West. It was from this
g e r m that m o d e r n C a p i t a l i s m
sprang and institutionalized that
concept of individual's freedom
where man is allowed to exploit
other individuals and the commu-
nity only to serve his personal gain.
Islam guarantees personal freedom
and p r o v i d e s o p p o r t u n i t i e s for
individual enterprise but not at the
cost of society or ideals of social
injustice. Reaction to Capitalism
has a p p e a r e d in the f o r m of
Socialism. It idolizes the social
basis to an extent individuals
are reduced to insignificant cogs in
the social machne, with no exist-
e n c e of its o w n o u t s i d e a n d
independent of the herd. There-
fore the community alone enjoys
freedom as well as power; the
individual has no right to question
its authority or demand his rights.
The tragedy of Socialism and its
variants is that they assign to the
state absolute powers to shape the
lives of individuals.
Islam strikes a balance between
the two extremes of Capitalism and
Socialism. Being appreciative of
their role Islam harmonizes tne
individual and the state in such a
way that individuals have the
freedom necessary to develop their
potentialities and not to encroach
upon the rights of their fellowmen.
It also gives the community and the
state adequate powers to regulate
and control the socio-economic
relationships so as to guard and
maintaim this harmony in human
life. T h e b a s i s of this w h o l e
structure as envisaged by Islam is
the reciprocity of love between
individuals and groups; it i not
erected on the basis of hatred and
class conflict as is the case with
Socialism.
ISLAMIC R E V I V A L C O N T I N U E D
In the light of the above, one can
begin to understand why revolu-
tions in M u s l i m l a n d s are a
logical consequence:
Iran: What has happened is a
single demonstration (excuse the
pun) of the deep-rooted beliefs at
work. Neither the U S or Russia
had any hand to play. The whole
world was taken by surprise at the
Islamic aspect.
Afghanistan: Again the forces of
faith are rising against the puppet
rule of Russia.
These are two recent examples
All sectors of the community in the
whole world show their longing to
live and be governed according to
the rules set by G o d . For the past
1400 y e a r s s u c h revivals were
taking place. Misinformation by
i n c o m p e t a n t o r i e n t a l i s t s h a v e
caused ignorance about Islam in
the West. A new atmosphere now
exists for U S to find out about
Islam.
P O P U L A R M Y T H S
Whenever Islam is mentioned by
Non-Muslim Westerners, it usually
involves narrow minded views on:
Islam and polygamy; Islam and
punishment (say lashing); Islam and
repression, etc. A good reference
for those who have not heard 'the
other side' as explained by Muslims
may care to r e a d 'Islam T h e
Misunderstood Religion' or 'The
Spread Of Islam' or any of the
huge literature that exists these
days, but is not 'good value' to be
printed in Western newspapers.
Both books can be seefi at book
displays in the Islamic Week and
can be readily obtained.
C O R R E C T I O N S
G o d is O N E , Islam (allegiance to
God) has been the religion of all
the prophets, including Moses and
Jesus and has been completed for
us u n d e r M o h a m m a d . M a n y
schools of thought such as Ja'afari,
Maliki, etc, exist but N O SHI'ITE—
S U N N I categorisation is advocated
e x c e p t by the i g n o r a n t news
reporters or by the enemies of
Islam working under the banner
'Divide T o Rule'!!
M I S I N F O R M A T I O N
Well publicised and distributed news magazines are Newsweek,
Now and Time. A few quotations will show how ignorant, harsh
and cruel the treatment of anyone who upholds Islam is treated:
'The holy city where Khomeini stole a revolution for Iran.'
'Qom is the spiritual powerhouse of Iran's revolution. It thrives
on piety.'
'Khomeini....has turned to a bloody tyrant, reviving a religious
Dark Age.'
'The brutality is a popular element.'
'The mass taste for the cruel has been fed most luridly by the
revolution's own judge Blood.'
'A joyless Revolution.'
'Laughter is a crime in the Islamic Republic'
'A harsh, fundamentalist theocracy.'
'The Mystic Who Lit The Fires Of Hatred.'
'Unifying a nation behind such extremist positions is a
remarkable achievement.'
'Shi'ism allows for the presence of an Intermediary between God
and man.'
