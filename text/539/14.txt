N U S C O N F E R E N C E REPORT
by Chris Webb
O n c e again, despite our non-member-
ship of the National U n i o n of Students, a
member of this college union went to the
recent conference (in the guise of a party
helper).
T h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t p a r t o f t h e
conference, officially at least, are the
debates, which were as follows:
• • • • • •
S U B S C R I P T I O N S : Remember it
was primarily over subs that I C U
left N U S . W h a t did we get for our
money? In front of conference were
five proposals: ranging from the
Execidea, a confused extension of
currents subs policy, w h i c h would
h a v e h a d half of N U S ' s m o n e y
coming from forty institutions (ie
universities and some of the larger
polytechnics) at a rate increasing
t w i c e as f a s t a s m o s t u n i o n ' s
b u d g e t s . H a d t h i s p o l i c y b e e n
passed I feel many colleges would
have disaffiliated as they bagan to
feel the pinch. A t the other extreme
was the r a t h e r s i m p l i s t i c K i n g s
amendment, arguing for a more or
less flat rate.
In the end all the amendments,
and the main motion all failed. This
leaves N U S with a big problem:
some sort of subs policy must be
w o r k e d out at Easter, a n d ratified
at C h r i s t m a s or they may go bust.

O V E R S E A S S T U D E N T S : T h e
Left A l l i a n c e / E x e c / T o r y / L i b main
motion, a fairly moderate statement
of i n t e l l i g e n t a n d c o n s t r u c t i v e
o p p o s i t i o n to the G o v e r n m e n t ' s
ideas was passed, despite Trot a n d
Maoist attempts to pass m u c h more
rabid and destructive amendments.
This motion, incidentally, must set
s o m e s o r t of r e c o r d : s o m a n y
colleges submitted similar motions
that the final composite had 145
"Believes" clauses.
G R A N T S A N D C U T S : P r o v e d
m o r e c o n t e n t i o u s — t h e L e f t
A l l i a n c e / E x e c m a i n m o t i o n , e x -
p r e s s i n g o p p o s i t i o n t o t h e T o r y
e c o n o m i c p o l i c y , e s p e c i a l l y " t h e
c u t s " and reaffirming the desire to
a b o l i s h the m e a n s test etc w a s
passed eventually. T h e amendments
proved interesting: the two Trot
groups proposed similar motions
spelling out a "recipe for Instant
W h i p S o c i a l i s m " according to the
L i b e r a l b r o a d s h e e t . T h e T o r y
amendment supported the G o v e r n -
ment's economic ideals, a n d the
Liberals proposed their "student
wage" policy, which I have not yet
had explained to me. T h e most
amusing was the Maoist shopping
list of d e m a n d s f o r i m m e d i a t e
nationalisation.
H O U S I N G : A n o t h e r m a s s i v e
composite of E x e c / T o r y / L A etc.
This placed the onus of finding
a c c o m m o d a t i o n f o r h o m e l e s s
students on local authorities, was
a g a i n s t t h e s e l l i n g of c o u n c i l
h o u s e s , a g a i n s t f l a t a g e n c i e s ,
against licences and in favour of
multi-signature mortgages.
A B O R T I O N : Deja V u . V e r y like
t h e I C U / U L U A b o r t i o n / C o r r i e
debates, with a rousing summing up
speech from A n n a Soubry (prob-
ably the best of the conference).
S U P P O R T D E R E K R O B I N S O N :
T h i s w a s a n e m e r g e n c y m o t i o n
(Robinson was a guest speaker,
w h o , c o n t r a r y to s o m e n a t i o n a l
press reports received a far from
unanimous ovation). In the end, the
Left groups were all so busy voting
out each other's views on union
solidarity that nothing was passed.
Trevor Phillips then tried to tell the
press that this didn't mean N U S
didn't support Robinson, but was
correctly ruled out of order.
S o m u c h for the motions, what of the
rest: Firstly the Left Alliance (nee B r o a d
Left) — the C P , N O L S and some Liberals
is falling apart — many Liberals don't like
it, and the C P had very few delegates.
The two Trot groups, S S A and S W S O ,
had a reasonable number of delegates,
but their speakers were unimpressive and
their behaviour to the M a y o r of Blackpool
left a very sour impression: his council let
N U S use the Winter G a r d e n s free, yet
when he came to welcome conference the
Trots congregated on the balcony to jeer
at him. Eventually Phillips shut them up,
pointing out that even if they didn't like
the fact that he was a Conservative, he
was democratically elected by the people
of B l a c k p o o l and we were their guests.
The M a y o r , later that day, to his credit
was instrumental in securing the release
f r o m p o l i c e c u s t o d y of t w o N o r t h e r n
Irish delegates who had been detained on
landing in Liverpool.

CITY AND GUILDS
A new term starts and the M i g h t y
Guilds Organization swings into action to
provide y o u with the best events in the
College.
T h e first event is the Pyjama R a g on
Saturday 19th January. F o r this R a g we
all dress up in pyjamas or other night
attire. Don't worry if you haven't got a
pair, you are sure to be able to borrow
some from a friend, then we go out into
L o n d o n and extract money from people
who keep asking stupid questions like
" W h y are y o u still wearing pyjamas at 11
o'clock in O x f o r d Street?"
A bit of fun for all, so meet in the
U n i o n Office at 9:30am suitably dressed.
The next event is the 29th A n n u a l
Engineers Dinner and Dance. This is
the highlight of the College year a n d is a ,
formal occasion. T h e event will be held in
the S h e r f i e l d B u i l d i n g o n F r i d a y 2
January at 7:30 for 8:00pm. T h e evening
consists of a formal dinner followed by a
cabaret and dancing to the early hours of
Saturday. H e n c e the name D i n n e r and
Dance or D & D for short.
Tickets are on sale from the U n i o n
Office or from D e p Reps at the price of
£18.00 for a double ticket and £10.00 for a
single and are limited in number, so get
yours early. The dress for the evening is
black tie. W e have managed to negotiate
a deal with M o s s B r o s , which will give a
25% reduction to you on Droduction of a
union card for the hire of a dinner jacket
at any of their L o n d o n branches.
D o not miss the chance to go to
this outstanding event.
A l s o we need an Assistant H o n o r a r y
Secretary, so if y o u feel vou would like to
do this job for the rest of the year (It
entails minute taking at various meetings
and gives a good insight into how the
Union is run.) see J o or Sara in the
Office. The post will be elected at the
next G e n C o m on 29th January.
Cheers Bryan.
