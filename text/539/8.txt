LIBERAL CLUB
S o we start a new d e c a d e , that
includes the year 1984, with uncer-
tainty about the future and what it
holds in store. New technology has
the potential to take over m a n u a l
labour, a n d a g o o d job too! W h y
should we expect people to take jobs
we don't want to do? But there is no
point in having ultra-modern industry
with five m i l l i o n or m o r e p e o p l e
u n e m p l o y e d w i t h n o p u r p o s e or
interest in life. We will have to share
work available by shorter w o r k i n g
hours and lives and at the same time
provide facilities for people to make
u s e of t h e i r i n c r e a s e d free t i m e .
C o u p l e d with new t e c h n o l o g y , we
n e e d massive investment to make
education, craft training, and socially
valuable work available to all people.
However, instead we have a Govern-
ment c u t t i n g b a c k d r a s t i c a l l y o n
education facilities, while unemploy-
ment steadily rises. Imperial College
L i b e r a l c l u b o p p o s e s this lack of
v i s i o n a n d t h r o u g h the U n i o n of
Liberal Students and Young Liberals
will be developing alternative policies
on the provision of welfare services
and education, employement and new
technology and the role people play in
this, which is, after all, what politics is
all aboutl
Our first event this term will be a
combined social evening and debate.
N i c k A m o r , the U n i o n of L i b e r a l
Students Education Officer, will be
s p e a k i n g on a ' L i b e r a l E d u c a t i o n
System' and afterwards there will be
an open discussion and free supper.
Everyone is welcome, either to make
their views known or to find out more
about Liberalism. It's 7:30pm in the
Union Lower Refectory.
Happy New Year
