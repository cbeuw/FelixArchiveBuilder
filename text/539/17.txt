starring NING YANG HO Y U F U LUNG
and LI CHI WONG as ZOE Z o e
Upon the altars of the ancient Chinese temples burned a mystic fire - ever
tended by the vestal virgin. T o this sacred flame were added special fragrances
• incense of careful blending. What hidden value had those aromas? Was there
a mystical significance to the passive atmosphere they created?
Virginity as a form of morality was elevated to a divine status accounting for
the widespread practice of assigning special temple duties to young girls who
had been selected for their chastity.
Legend relates that Fu-hsi; the founder of the Chinese empire, was the son
of a virgin who ate a flower which had clung to her garments when bathing.
Amongst the young Chinese virgins there was one named Zarathustra. She
lusted for a man whenever she bathed in the aroma of the incense from the
sacred flame. One night her lust was satisfied. In a poetically erotic moment
Zarathustra is taken by a muscular temple guard. During their ecstacy one
sees flashes of his body, shining with sacred oils, as he makes love to her in a
giant oyster-shell supported by a column of marble.
Time passes and Zarathustra's child is born in a shadowy glade. As the baby
makes its first sounds; her mother screams in terror. There before her lay a
baby girl but, because she had broken her virginity, G o d had made her pay an
awful price. The baby was a monster with four eyes, a nose for a mouth and lips
in the top of its head, (see above inset photo)
Zarathustra carefully tended the child and named her Zoe. Zoe was made a
prisoner in the gardens of the temple and was never allowed to meet anyone.
Twenty years later .... Zoe stumbled on a group of witches who were
performing a naked ritual. Zoe was caught and satanically sacrificed. The film
contains many special effects but the moment when Zoe ascends to the stars is
the most brilliant effect in the film. Sucked up towards the swirling heavens
Zoe is drawn towards a black hole. She emerges after travelling through a time
warp that has advanced her through many centuries.
Zoe has gained special powers. She has been armed with four laser eyes. A
space craft speeds towards Zoe and a terrific battle ensues. Zoe tries to defend
herself from the ferocious attacks of the craft but can she survive? Is this film
the ultimate in sci-fi satire? You'll feel sorry for the four eyed monster ....
Watch Out she is coming to get you!

A s some of you may have noticed,
there's been a price rise in the bars. 1
don't like this any more than anyone else
does, but it can't be helped; it's over a
year now since the last increase (except
for the one forced upon us by the higher
V A T rate) a n d there's been a large
i n c r e a s e from all the b r e w e r s , w h i c h
together with various projected increased
costs due to inflation have made these
increases necessary.
