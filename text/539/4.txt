Dear Editor
I would like to bring to your
attention that many things available
in our Union Bookshop are sold at
a seemingly unreasonable price.
For example, A 4 paper folder is
72p at W H Smith, 60p at Barkers
(both in High Street, Kensington)
but a similar one in our Union
Bookshop costs £1.00. Computer
paper folders were 50p in June
1979 but when a subsequent batch
came in in August 1979 they were
80p. I really doubt that it is possible
at aD to have a near doubling in
p r i c e b e t w e e n t w o s u c c e s s i v e
orders b y the Bookshop.
I a m sure many students will
have noticed similar sorts of things.
I would be glad if you can answer
the following doubts:
(1) What is the legal' profit margin
that our bookshop is supposed to
make?
(2) Has the Bookshop been making
the c o r r e c t profit (I m e a n in
accordance to the profit margin set
by the Union) margin in the past
years?
(3) A r e the actual prices (such as
the items quoted above) in the
Bookshop based o n the correct
profit margin set by the Union? If
not, why?
(4) Have the Union checked the
prices in our Bookshop from time
to time to ensure that the prices
tagged down by the Bookshop are
in a c c o r d a n c e with the profit
margin set by the Union? If not, is
it not easy enough to put this into
practise?
Thank you very much
Yours faithfully

Sir
Allow me to be the first in what I
am sure will grow to a veritable
chorus of congratulation. I refer to
the enlightened attitude of the
Estates office towards the repair of
the College squash courts.
In these days of critical path
analysis a n d time a n d m o t i o n
studies it is indeed a courageous
d e c i s i o n t o s p e c i f y f o r t h e
execution of this task, such careful
artisans. Rather than conform to
the frantic pace of modern life they
alone are content patiently to carry
out their labour at their o w n
painstaking rate.
T h e minor disruption to o u r
petty routine caused by several
months of squash deprivation we
should bear with fortitude. What
are a few months compared with
the decades taken to complete the
great Cathedrals of Europe?
M y c o u n t l e s s e x p e d i t i o n s to
observe the work in progress have
at last been rewarded by a rare
glimpse of these tireless artisans
performing their time-honoured
craft. Such a sight would silence
those tiresome individuals who
claimed that the repairs could have
easily been completed by the end
of the summer vacation.
I leave you to ponder the effect
such a prosaic philosophy would
have had on the timeless majesty
of the Taj Mahal or the immortal
grace of Michelangelo's replastering
of the Sistine Chapel.
Yours

I C C A G would like to thank everyone
who contributed to our appeal last
term. T h e College collection a m o u n -
ted to seven carrier bags of clothes,
six bags and three large boxes of food
and £ 3 3 in money. T h e population of
Shelter varied from 250-450 over the
Christmas week and they were all very
grateful for the food and clothing.
Many of them are now back on the
streets, so if you want to meet some,
we have soup runs on Tuesday, Friday
and (probably) Sunday nights — meet
in Falmouth Hall Kitchen at 10:30pm.
For anyone interested in any other
aspect of I C C A G ' s work (eg children,
old people, prisoners etc etc), we have
a meeting every Monday lunchtime
(12:30) in the I C C A G room (top floor
of the Union Building — follow the
signs).

During the Christmas vacation, the
1979 version of the above annual
event was held. It attracted a varied
entry of twelve teams from London
Colleges such as QEC, Kings, UC and
Brunei, including IC entries from
Chem Eng, Mech Eng, Civ Eng, CCD
and Maths.
In his final summing up Professor
Samuel Eilon explained some of the
difficulties of taking part in a game of
such short duration and then
presented a liquid prize to the winning
team (Kings C o l l e g e C i v E n g
department).
There was absolutely no prize for
the second placed team — IC Maths
(Team: Chris Callow, Ashok Patel,
Jitesh Gajjar, Barry Wareing and Mick
Berry) who refused to reveal the
secret behind their success (a loss of
only £42,926, putting them well ahead
of IC Chem Eng in 3rd).
The free refresh-ments at least
guaranteed that all teams showed a
profit in material terms.
