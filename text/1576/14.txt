Imperial’s Fabulous Fashionistas of the Week
Cécile Borkhataria explores our campus which is teaming with stylish guys and gals, and what better way to share
their fashion inspiration than to have them pose for Felix and tell us all about where they get their ideas and cool outits?

Meet Jack Parkinson, a 4th year
physicist. As I sat on one of the
tables outside the union bar, I was
hoping to ind a well dressed man
for my inal picture of the day, and
low and behold - he was there on
the bench outside the bar. As I
approached him and asked if he’d
like to be featured in Felix, he
seemed shy, yet lattered and eager
to tell me about his style, and the
fact that he own 20 pairs of shoes!
Impressive for a man of Imperial.
When I asked Jack where he got his
fashion inspiration from, he replied
‘I just wear things I like.’ After
some thought, his friend mentions
that he is ‘super preppy.’ hat’s
debateable. Jack tells me he loves
to shop at Reiss and Zara, staple
brands for those who embrace the
smart casual look. Jack doesn’t have
any fashion icons (smells like lies, I
bet he wishes he was Ryan Gosling),
and he describes
his style as unconventional.
So the big question is, where did he
get his threads from?
Red scarf: United Colours of
Benetton
Shoes: Barkers
Socks (he got excited about his
socks): Marks and Spencer
Knitted trousers: Zara
Watch: Emporio Armani
T-shirt: Zara (he thinks, but he told
me he was too shy to take it of and
check.)
As I thank him and make my way
back to my table, he calls me and
says ‘actually, can you add quirky
to my style description?’ So there
you have it, Jack Parkinson is THE
unconventional quirk.
I couldn’t have put it better myself.

Imperial’s business school, studying
innovation, entrepreneurship and
management (what a mouthful!)
I spotted her on a sunny day in
Prince’s Gardens. She was with her
business school team and I simply
had to have her in this spread. She
beamed when I asked her if she’d
like her picture in an article about
Imperial’s best dressed.
As she stood up for the picture, my
brother, Guillaume Borkhataria,
on her course and team, told her
how to pose so that the picture
would look ‘just right.’ A degree in
ilm production does make you a
perfectionist when it comes to these
things, but the pose is just fabulous,
and isn’t her smile infectious?
Naisa doesn’t get her fashion
inspiration from any place in
particular, for her, its innate.
Massimo Dutti and Burberry are
amongst her favourtire brands. She
describes her dress sense as ‘boyish,
classic chic.’ Her choice of beige
hues is indeed very chic. Audrey
Hepburn is reborn in this lady!
Naisa got here beautiful outit
from many of our favourite stores:
Jacket: Zara
Sweater: Massimo Dutti
Shoes: Zara
Sunglasses: Ray Ban
Bag: Longchamp (le pliage)
As I leave she thanks me and
excitedly asks me when the story
goes to print. Here it is darling,
keep doing Imperial proud with
your sense of style!
homas, a irst year Biochemist and
perhaps one of the most eccentric
and fabulously dressed men I’ve ever
met, owns his style with conidence
and attitude. When I asked homas
where he gets his inspiration from,
he told me that he has no icons or
speciic sources of inspiration, he
‘deines himself’ and his own style.
He would describe his style as ‘East
London meets West london.’
He likes to incorporate chic polished
coats and accessories with trainers
and other eccentric shoes like silver
sandals. His silver sandals are so
lashythatheevengotcomplemented
by one of the guys from the mormon
church on exhibition road! You know
you’ve got style when even the suited
missionaries of Christ are checking
you out.
He has no favourite designers in
particular, and generally shuns the
mainstream fashion world in favour
of lesser known creative individuals.
Tom prefers to dress himself in
clothes from hidden gem designers,
those that are still emerging in the
fashion world. For everyday basics
though, he swears by Cos.
he clothes he’s wearing in this
picture are from an eclectic mix of
high street and designer brands.
Shoes: Superga
Coat: Ermenegildo Zegna
Cigarette holder (which oh-so
fabulously pulls together the look):
Harrods
Sunglasses: Benjamin eyewear
Socks: asos
As I show Tom the pictures, he
insists that I pick this one because
it ‘captures his best side’ and the
all-important cigarette holder. He
doesn’t do fashion darling, he is
fashion.
Alex, a feisty Lebanese chick, is a
irst year mechanical engineering
student here. Her name isn’t
quite pronounced how you think
though. You see in Lebanon they
speak French, so this lady’s name is
pronounced ‘Ah -leks.’
Alex gets a lot of her fashion
inspiration from magazines,
especially vogue and Elle.
Her favourite designers are
TopShop (the girl loves it, most of
her outit comes from the shopping
heaven), Zara, dsquared2 and
Prada.
Alex describes her style as
comfortable and breezy, and it’s
true, I often see her in loose dresses
and stylish oversized sweaters.
Her fashion icons are mainly
models, like Agnes Dean and Alexa
Chung. hese girls know how look
efortlessly cool, just like Alex. So
where does she get her trendy garbs
from?
Cropped top: TopShop
Jeans: TopShop
Jacket: Levi’s
Shoes: Superga
Sunglasses: Prada
Bag: Marc Jacobs
