Wait... are people actually starting
to enjoy science?
philippa Skett reviews Imperial Festival and the wider public engagement movement
IMpERIAL CoLLEgE LoNDoN
T
he third annual Imperial
Festival took place last
weekend on campus, and
saw students, staf and
members of the public
alike come together for the ambitious
public engagement endeavour. he
scientists of Imperial, usually hidden
away in their labs and lecture theatres,
came out in full force to share what
Imperial gets up to in its day to day
workings.
However, why has Imperial taken
to hosting such a large scale, complex
event that was completely free to
attend? Why are science festivals, that
run the risk of failing due to the stigma
science can have of being boring or too
complex, actually rising in popularity?
Are people starting to actually enjoy
science?
Building on the foundations of
previous Imperial Fringe nights and
preceding Festivals, this year’s festival
spanned over two days, beginning on
Friday afternoon and spanning late
into Saturday evening.
Attractions were scattered right
across campus, and included guest
lectures, comedy performances,
surgery simulations, and student
musical acts. hese were all based
around the central pivot of the festival,
the Research Zone, located inside the
omnipresent marquee on Queen’s
Lawn. Here the staf and students
of Imperial presented their current
research and experiments, giving a
platform to the work we as a college
spend our time doing behind closed
lab doors.
here were also lots of opportunities
for visitors to gain some hands-
on experience themselves, such as
extracting DNA from strawberries,
seeing the world through the eyes of
a ly, building edible molecule models,
or just sit serenely stitching long
strings of blood vessels.
A Pop-Up Surgery, based in SAF,
was hosted by the fantastically named
Dr Roger Kneebone. It featured an
operating theatre complete with
a realistic patient on the surgical
table, and also boasted “cutting
edge” technology – a scalpel that can
detect cancerous tissues as it cuts
into them. Meanwhile, Dr Sujata
Kundu, Imperial alumnus and cocktail
connoisseur, explained the chemistry
behind alcoholic concoctions, with
free samples available for the adults of
the audience.
Smaller attractions included a
Dance Tent featuring belly dancers
and student performances, such as
Funkology, and a Workshop tent
primarily for the younger visitors.
here were also campus tours of
College’s own laboratories, robotic
centres and even our resident light
simulator. Tours proved to be very
popular, with slots being fully booked
within two hours of the festival
opening.
Appropriately, some of Imperial’s
humanities students (a very rare breed
of students), those studying science
Communication, also got involved
with the festival, many presenting their
projects for the public to see. hese
included Project Uproot, a grassroots
initiative hoping to get more people
interested in environmentalism and
ecology, who succeeded in re-homing
over one hundred re-potted plants.
Over the past two years, visitors
have attended in their thousands,
and this year was no exception.
Although one visitor explained that
they attend each year to catch up on
the research of one group of scientists
and see how their work is developing,
many other visitors simply came to
enjoy wandering about between the
attractions at their own pace.
Many said the festival had a pleasant
atmosphere, that they enjoyed their
time looking around campus and said
it actually felt almost like a festival
– with the farmer’s market, music
and (mostly) undisturbed sunshine
contributing to a leisurely day spent
on campus (for a change). So could
it be that the festival was indeed a
success?
Imperial Festival is just one branch
of the growing movement that is the
public engagement of science, an
increasingly important priority for
anyone involved in science in any way,
shape or form.
With it being only recently that
the government has acknowledged
that science communication is more
beneicial when it is interactive
between scientists and the general
population, as opposed to one-
directional, much more efort has
been put into engagement events like
these.
hese sort of events aim to start a
dialogue about science, and blur the
lines between the scientists in the lab
and the public that their work can
ultimately efect, hopefully leading to
both groups inluencing and shaping
the work and opinions of the other.
However, just like the Imperial
Festival, public engagement of science
is very much in its infancy. Some
“public engagement” endeavours
can be rather circular in nature, with
enthusiastic scientists preaching (or
rather, communicating) to the choir
of equally enthusiastic science fans,
and not really interacting with a wider,
more diverse audience.
Such a trap is easy to fall into
considering students at Imperial
are already pretty committed to
science, and don’t need a whole
festival, blocking the library entrance,
to reinforce that. Some certainly
don’t need encouragement during
the intense revision season when
relationships between students and
their subjects are almost at breaking
point.
In fact, many in attendance, such
as some of the older alumni, actually
brought excited, attentive children.
With such a varied range of attractions
on ofer, it is more than likely it did
make a lasting impact in some way,
at least on the younger generation if
not those who are already committed
science advocates.
However, the aims of public
engagement with science is not
to make more people want to be
scientists, or even want to study at
Imperial (this may require more than
a weekend festival). It is ultimately to
make what is perceived to be “science”
more accessible to those not directly
in contact with it, and for science to
it almost seamlessly into the wider
society as a whole.
hese events therefore don’t act in
isolation, but are contributing as a
whole to a potential cultural paradigm
shift, where science isn’t seen separate
anymore to the wider society but
complementary to it, and something
people will be willing to discuss and
learn about more frequently.
Hopefully, the Festival left both
those visiting and those hosting the
festival thinking about how science
isn’t as abstract and alien a concept
as some perceive it to be, and no
doubt has set the stage for even more
impressive public engagement feats in
the future.
If not, it at least provided a welcome
revision break from those studying
science in the library to have a glimpse
at science in action in the wider world.
