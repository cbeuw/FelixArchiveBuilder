Introducing ‘The Guardian’
Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner team up for an action-packed adventure.
Kevin Costner returns to the silver
screen with The Guardian. Taking
the lead as Ben Randall, he is a leg-
endary Coast Guard Rescue Swim-
mer and we join Ben at the scene
of his unravelling. At the height
of a massive storm, Ben Randall
loses his best friend and the rest of
his rescue crew when he attempts
to save a boat of shipwrecked
fishermen.
Sent on an unwanted sabbatical
to recuperate from the accident, he
is forced to teach a new batch of re-
cruits who want to be Rescue Swim-
mers like himself. At ‘A School’,
the academy to train rescuers so
that others may live, Ben Randall
locks head with cocky swimming
champion
Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher).
Jake is a mystery by himself, he
is a swimming champion and he
has been offered scholarships to
Ivy League universities but he has
chosen to eat humble pie as a Res-
cue Swimmer. He proves to be the
strongest and the fastest among all
the recruits and yet he fails to ob-
tain Ben’s approval until a bar fight
turns these rivals into comrades.
The Guardian is a story about the
unsung heroes from the U.S. Coast
Guard, which has been aptly de-
scribed by Ashton Kutcher as one
of the few branches that the U.S.
Government trains only to save
lives, not take them. It must be
noted that the action scenes in the
storm benefited tremendously from
Andrew Davis’ meticulousness and
expertise in cinematography.
Unfortunately for The Guardian,
the story is largely predictable and
it is a strange mixture of Top Gun
and Ashton Kutcher’s famous co-
medic personality. The length of
the film was also a bit of a drag and
the cheesy ending left the audience
with a bitter aftertaste. However,
Jake Fischer’s confrontation with
Ben Randall was extremely realis-
tic and demonstrated a side of Ash-
ton Kutcher’s talents which have
not been immediately obvious in his
previous films.
Fortunately for Felix, we managed
to ask Ashton Kutcher his opinion
on the films he has made so far and
the kind of films he prefers to be in
henceforth.
Ashton: As a young actor, you
don’t have a lot of choices in the
beginning. However, now that my
choices have grown, I like to be in
movies with a story I like to tell. It
does not matter if it’s a romantic
comedy, horror or action film. It is
the story that matters.
Another interesting piece of news
is that the U.S Coast Guard set up a
recruiting booth at the official open-
ing of The Guardian in Chicago.
It is rather inspirational to watch
people risking their lives to save
others. However, will it encour-
age you to do the same? You be
the judge when the film opens on
October 20. Ashton Kucher and Kevin Costner star in The Guardian.
At first glance, you might wonder
why Felix has dedicated its film
section to reviewing a pornograph-
ic film. Despite the title, there is
no sex at all in the film. Scenes Of
A Sexual Nature is a movie about
relationships, an interwoven net of
emotions of seven different couples
who were all spending a sunny af-
ternoon in Hampstead Heath.
Andrew Lincoln stars as Jamie,
a middle-aged married man who
suddenly becomes transfixed with
a schoolgirl’s underwear. This turn
of events does not bode well with
his wife, Molly (Holly Aird) who had
just voiced her doubts about their
marriage. The brilliant aspect of
this scene is the indirect method
with which Molly expressed her
worries. Unfortunately true for the
rest of the world, some women can
be dreadful bush-beaters but not
all will be as ingenious as Molly to
mention it with the help of Cosmo.
Other notable couples in the
film include an elderly couple, Iris
(Eileen Atkins) and Eddie (Ben-
jamin Whitrow). When visiting their
favourite viewpoint in Hampstead
Heath, they meet and discover they
were each other’s dream lover 40
years ago. Seizing the rare chance
of getting to know a stranger you
fell in love with, they spend an af-
ternoon getting to know each other.
It is not always a good idea to meet
the person of your dreams. Funny
man, Noel (Tom Hardy) tries to chat
up Anna (Sophie Okonedo) who has
Some people just don’t know when to give up.

Ewan McGregor in sexual scenes? No.
just been dumped by a commit-
ment-phobic. Can someone please
get this guy a copy of Chatting Up
Girls For Dummies?
To some people’s dismay, Ewan
McGregor did not sing or dance in
this film. Instead of his usual cheeky
mischievous girl-chasing self, he is
trying a new sport i.e. boy-chasing.
It might be shocking to imagine how
trendy playing a gay character is in
the film industry. However, the big-
gest shock comes from how realis-
tic and convincing Ewan McGregor
is as the promiscuous homosexual,
Billy. His life-partner, Brian (Doug-
las Hodge) is desperate to have
Billy all to himself. However, Billy
demands a high price for his com-
mitment. He wants to adopt a baby.
Brian doesn’t want a baby but will
he compromise his own desires for
the sake of love? Not to be cynical,
but it isn’t even a blood agreement.
The film is interesting and it is a
light-hearted way to spend 93 min-
utes. However, the lack of change in
scenery does lend a slight monoto-
nous disadvantage. While the script
is highly entertaining, it is a film
without a true conclusion. When
you watch this film, it feels like you
have just been given a strange in-
timate perspective of these seven
couples’ lives for an afternoon. Its
best advantage is it lacks the happi-
ly-ever-after and cheesy character-
istic that usually defines a romantic
comedy. In this case, Scenes Of A
Sexual Nature’s uniqueness might
leave the audience semi-puzzled at
the end of the show.
