The word is connected.
With 6,000 people around the world we thought it would be good to start a big conversation,
where everyone can share thoughts, experiences and ideas. So we gave everyone the tools
– weblogs, podcasts, instant messaging, even our own Wiki workspace – and let them get on
with it. The results have been spectacular, for our people, our clients, our business. Is any other
investment bank so inclusive, so connected? We doubt it.
Spread the word.
