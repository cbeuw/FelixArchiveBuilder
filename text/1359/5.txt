Imperial’s bright young things
Imperial Entrepreneurs describe how it is changing perceptions of the business world and how a selection
of industrious students have cleared their debt and made a very tidy profit in the process.
After a summer lazing about watch-
ing The Apprentice or Dragon’s
Den you could be forgiven if you
thought starting a company was
simply glorified self-humiliation. A
dynamic new organisation created
by active student entrepreneurs
from within Imperial wants to
change that for the better. Sumon
Sadhu, President & Co-founder of
Imperial Entrepreneurs, who pre-
viously worked under Dragon’s
Den judge Doug Richard, explains
further: “The perception of busi-
ness plans and suits is dated. Real
entrepreneurs define themselves in
terms of what they’ve actually done
when opportunities arise, not what
they procrastinated. We’re here to
address that image.”
Indeed, some of the biggest busi-
nesses in the world didn’t follow
their first business plan. Microsoft,
founded by Bill Gates and Paul Al-
len in a Harvard dorm room in 1975
would have folded had it followed its
original plan to avoid operating sys-
tems in the first place. The stories
of Microsoft, Dell, Google and Ap-
ple all started in dorm rooms, and
illustrate what’s possible by going
beyond the lectures and problem
sheets. “There’s probably no better
time to start a venture than now,
surrounded by some of the smart-
est people you’ve ever met, and
some of the best opportunities,”
says Sebastian Wolf, co-founder of
Imperial Entrepreneurs.
Apart from acting to change the
perception of entrepreneurship,
the society has made headway in
the entrepreneurial world itself. It
has already established significant
partnerships with The Glasshouse,
described as ‘the epicentre of Lon-
don’s internet scene’ and TiE-UK,
the UK branch of the largest en-
trepreneurial network in the world.
Thesepartnershipswillopenunique
opportunities for IE members to
network, find mentors and above
all, learn from real-world entre-
preneurs. In addition, the society’s
website, imperialentrepreneurs.
com, is powered by the ‘Synergy’
database. This database allows all
members to list their interests and
actively seek out potential partners
to start ventures with.
“Entrepreneurs are real people,
and they’re probably some of the
most interesting characters you’ll
come across as they’re always striv-
ing to think differently. We want to
connect our members to the com-
munity that exists here in London,”
says communications officer, Mah-
moud Usman.
The registration-only Launch
Party for Imperial Entrepreneurs
will provide the ideal opportunity
for IC students to come in contact
with the London entrepreneurial
community. Building its reputation,
the society has attracted big names
such as Alex Tew (founder of mil-
liondollarhomepage.com), Michael
Smith (co-founder of Firebox.com
and MindCandy Design CEO) and
Charlie Osmond (founder of Fresh-
minds) as speakers for its launch
event on October 19.
Imperial Entrepreneurs forms
the sixth society in a network of
nationwide entrepreneurship soci-
eties, acting to change the culture
at UK universities. This group in-
cludes Oxford and the LSE, with
whom the society is hosting events
later this year.
“Imperial Entrepreneurs is here
to provide people with the inspira-
tion, education, networking and ex-
perience to empower their ideas.”
Wolf says. “We’re already seeing
startups everywhere around Impe-
rial. This gives us an opportunity
to link together students who are
thinking different.”
“With or without grand visions of
the future, or an idea ready to go,
entrepreneurship can become very
real for anyone who chooses it.”
Wolf explains, “And that’s just it.
Entrepreneurship isn’t a job, it’s a
mindset. Even if you don’t want to
start a company, you can still nur-
ture the inner entrepreneur. Talk to
the beautiful stranger, find the best
in each problem, don’t stop at set-
backs in any walks of life – in short,
grab life and live it!” The future for
Imperial Entrepreneurs at this uni-
versity definitely looks bright.
The Imperial Entrepreneurs
launch party is on October 19 at
7.00pm in the Tanaka Business
School. Register for free at:

As far-fetched as it sounds,
it’s possible to set up a profit
making venture in an after-
noon. GimperialClothing.com
was founded by IE committee
members to prove this point.
In a single Saturday afternoon,
IE’s President, Sumon Sadhu,
and Secretary, Sebastian Wolf,
composed T-Shirt designs, cre-
ated a website and advertised
the venture on facebook.com.
By Monday, a profit had already
been made. “People may have
thought it was just a great idea.
We actually went out and did it
for fun,” Sadhu says. “That’s the
message we want to convey:
Don’t dream it, do it.” The fol-
lowing is a selection of entrepre-
neurs who didn’t just dream.
Alex Tew,
Milliondollarhomepage.com
Dreaming up ways of funding
his way through his degree, Alex
ended up with the intention of
finding a way to earn a million
dollars. He came up with the
idea of creating a website with
one million small pixels which
would be sold to advertisers for
$1 each. Rather than throwing
the idea out as crazy, Alex de-
cided to take a leap of faith and
start it off. Interest in the idea
snowballed and Alex used this
to his advantage culminating in
him making $1million in just 5
months. Alex only had time to
attend two lectures that term,
because of his success.
Michael Smith,
Firebox.com &
MindCandy Design
After leaving university, Michael
and his friend Tom Boardman
imagined creating a website
solely focussed on selling boys’
toys and gadgets. The pair
invented the shot glass chess
set which propelled sales from
Firebox.com allowing Michael to
turn the company into the one
of the fastest-growing internet
companies in the UK. Now
Michael has started up Mind-
Candy Design, creators of www.
perplexcity.com. Two years on
and MindCandy has raised a
cool $6 million in investment!
Charlie Osmond,
Freshminds Ltd
Holding a number of top
job offers with management
consultancies, Charlie had a
dilemma – should he stick with
a job or start his own com-
pany? Fortunately he made the
right decision, and together
with fellow engineer Caroline
Plumb founded Freshminds, a
recruitment consultancy for top
students. After starting in their
parent’s spare bedroom, the pair
grew the company to £1 million
a year in sales in three years!

Osmond speak at the Imperial
Entrepreneurs launch party.
