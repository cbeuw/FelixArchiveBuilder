Jewels in the Serpentine
Tony Heywood’s embelleshed sculptures are giving a little sparkle to Hyde Park
Calling
all theatre
lovers
Emily Lines
If you know anything at all about
theatre and the performing arts,
you’ll probably have heard of the
Laurence Olivier awards. They
are by far the most prestigious
awards in Theatreland, and are
handed out each year to the most
exceptional theatre, dance and
opera productions.
Since 1976 the awards have
been given out in more than 20
different categories to the most
legendary and iconic perform-
ers to grace the London stage, as
well as the most impressive and
innovative productions.
What’s this got to do with me, I
hear you cry. Surely these high-
brow cultural events are beyond
the influence of the theatre-going
public.
Not so, for each year the judg-
ing panel, as well as including the
cream of the theatre world, in-
cludes 14 members of the public.
There are eight available posi-
tions on the Theatre Panel, two
on the Opera Panel, two on the
Dance and two on the Affiliates
Panel.
If you are lucky enough to be se-
lected you will spend 2007 going
to all the biggest and most excit-
ing shows, and ultimately decid-
ing who gets the awards.
Applications are now open, and
although a passion for the theatre
is a requirement, the positions
are open to any and all, regard-
less of age and profession.
To apply you’ll need to write a
150-word review of a production
you’ve seen recently and also
provide a list of every produc-
tion you’ve seen in the last 12
months.
You can pick up an application
form at a West End theatre, or go
to their site, olivierawards.co.uk.
WIN Noel, he’ll
make you Happy
OK, so he’s not going come into
your bedroom and sing the ‘Mr
Blobby’ song to banish your blues,
but if you’ve seen Noel Edmonds
recently on Deal or No Deal, you’ll
know he’s chirpier than ever (if
that’s possible). Well, it turns
out he’s started doing something
called cosmic ordering, which ap-
parently changes your life and
gets you a slot on daytime TV and
into housewives’ hearts.
We at Felix are constantly wor-
ried about the effects of stress on
IC students, so we’ve teamed up
with Noel to offer one lucky end-
of-their-tether reader a signed
(yes SIGNED) copy of Noel’s new
self-help book, Positively Happy.
To win, just answer this simple
question: “What was the name of
Noel’s hit 1990s TV show?”Send
me your answer by Tuesday 5pm
to arts.felix@ic.ac.uk. Signed
photos for two runners-up to
drool over.
Something strange is growing in the
Serpentine, and it isn’t mould from
a tramp who fell in and drowned
last week. No, it’s sculptor Tony
Heywood’s newest piece, SuperAl-
gal Bloom.
Inspired by microscopic photog-
raphy of phytoplankton and zoo-
plankton, and by the blue and green
algal blooms that regularly appear
in the Serpentine, Heywood has
created a set of serenely colourful
pieces that dance gracefully on the
surface of the lake.
Catching your eye as you cross
the bridge, they glitter like crystals
in the sunshine, and reflect so per-
fectly that it’s hard to tell where the
bejewelled forms end and the lake
begins.
Despite being based on algae, the
forms are strangely reminiscent of
mutating watery forms. From glid-
ing swans to clam shells, they seem
perfectly in harmony with their
surroundings, and Heywood has
avoided the easy trap (so complete-
ly fallen into by Jim Lambie’s 2005
Turner work) of making sculpture
which is garish and tacky.
But the sculptor had a darker
motivation in this piece. He wants
to comment on the appearance of
mutant algae strains in reaction
to changing environmental condi-
tions. Indeed, one can imagine in
the half-light of dusk that the sculp-
tures would take on an eerie fairy-
tale-like quality, gliding across the
lake like a deformed sea monster.
The sculptures will be there un-
til the end of October. If you crave
respite from the pressures of uni-
versity life and have an hour or
two to spare I highly recommend
that you take the time to wander
through Kensington Gardens (head
towards the Serpentine Gallery) to
see them.

Usually, theatre reviews are in-
tended to give the reader an idea of
whether a given play is worth going
to see. Once they have been given a
few hints as to the plot, the cast, and
the quality of the production, the
reader may be tempted into seeing
a play that they wouldn’t otherwise,
or to avoid a disgusting piece of self-
conscious pretentiousness.
By those criteria, this review will
be almost utterly useless. Piano/
Forte finishes its month-long run on
Saturday, which is the day after this
edition of Felix will be published.
That gives you, dear reader, two
potential nights to buy tickets and
see this play. I urge you to sell your
dead grandmother’s gold teeth if
that’s what it takes to get seats for
Piano/Forte. You will not see such
a vivid, chaotic and furiously engag-
ing stage production for quite some
time.
Terry Johnson, fresh from send-
ing up the godfather of cinematic
suspense in Hitchcock Blonde,
writes (and directs) Piano/Forte
especially for its two leads: Kelly
Reilly (Pride & Prejudice, The Lib-
ertine) and Alicia Witt (Cybill, Va-
nilla Sky).
The opening scene shows Abigail
(Alicia Witt), a disturbed, agorapho-
bic, quiet (the Piano of the title) but
astoundingly gifted pianist (Alicia
Witt is a concert-standard pianist
and plays all of the music that is
heard onstage). She is alone in the
oak-panelled house in which she
was raised and now lives, looked
after by her mother’s Australian
brother Ray (Danny Webb).
This peaceful idyll is then utterly
destroyed by the return of her sis-
ter, Louise (Kelly Reilly), an equally
disturbed, angry, maniacal hell-
raiser (the eponymous Forte in the
title), whose only skill is causing
chaos. This prodigal homecoming
is precipitated by the impending
wedding of the girls’ father to a vac-
uous page 3 model. The marriage
symbolically coincides with the an-
niversary of their mother’s shotgun
suicide in the barn outside. When
the couple arrives, the heated ver-
bal exchanges shift to a barrage of
vicious semi-accusatory barbs from
a topless Louise, ceasing only when
the father leaves the stage.
From this point onwards, the
movement turns into a chaotic cre-
scendo, and to describe it would
do it no justice. We are then left to
pick over the obviously broken lives
onstage; a set of hurt and damaged
people, for whom normalcy is not
possible.Blamebecomesirrelevant.
When the end comes, it does so in
a totally different kind crescendo,
and finishes in a gunshot. Abigail
is alone onstage, playing Ravel.
The beauty of the play lies in the
disturbed lives and minds of char-
acters who have failed to move on
from the suicide of the person that
they all loved. The play becomes a
stunning study of the varying types
of insanity that trauma can engen-
der, especially the martyrdom-ob-
sessed and dysfunctionally furious
personality of Louise (Kelly Reilly
deserves a special mention for her
tempestuous portrayal) and the
quiet madness of Abigail.
Piano/Forte has a range like few
other plays, from the chaotic farce
to pathos, romance, vicious wit and
angry youth.
