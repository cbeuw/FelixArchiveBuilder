mean we have a far more powerful
voice than your bog-standard uni-
versity. The top universities in the
UK have interests so far removed
from some of the current members
of the NUS that the link between us
all as students is at best tenuous.
Our needs are different from most.
We have a far greater number of re-
search and overseas students than
your average institution. Employ-
ers are perfectly aware that not all
universities are equal. If we joined
the NUS then our voice would carry
equal weight to an institution that
matches us in terms of quantity but
not in terms of quality of students.
With around 50% of school leavers
now entering higher education the
idea that they will all have the same
priorities that NUS representatives
lobby for is a bit far fetched.
In conclusion, unless you are
particularly worried about nuclear
missiles being stationed on Queens
Lawn, then the NUS is irrelevant to
you. At best it is a well meaning, but
ultimately feckless, (top up fees are
here to stay, well done NUS!) lob-
bying group. At worst it represents
what we hate about career politi-
cians the most as at times it seems
to be acting less like a representa-
tive body for students and more like
agraduaterecruitmentprogramme
for the Labour Party. The question
we will all have to ask ourselves is
do we want our money spent so that
some of our more politically ambi-
tious colleagues can sanctimoni-
ously grandstand on our behalf or
would we rather the money was
kept in South Kensington? Person-
ally, I’d rather spend the cash buy-
ing everyone a pint than giving one
penny of it to a bunch of self-serving
politicos.
NUS: Is there any point?
T
hose of you new to IC
may be unaware that
our student body is no-
toriously apathetic. You
wouldn’t have noticed
this if you were accosted at the
Freshers’ Fair by one of the many
individuals armed with clipboards
seeking your signature for a peti-
tion for a referendum on affiliation
to the national student body. Well
its good to know there are so many
volunteers committed to the spirit
of public debate that they will give
up an entire day to promote one.
Was that not selfless of them? Eve-
rybody loves a good argument and
I was so impressed I even signed
myself. However I was slightly sad-
dened to find out that in retrospect
this was nothing but a stunt by an
assorted collection of Marxists,
New Labour apologists and the
plain naïve. Unsurprisingly, these
groups are all strongly in favour of
joining.
At the last referendum on whether
or not we should affiliate to the Na-
tional Union of Students the result
was an overwhelming 72% in favour
of ICU retaining its independence,
preferring instead to stick with
ULU for external representation.
With Imperial leaving the Univer-
sity of London we are no longer eli-
gible for ULU membership so again
our involvement with student col-
lectives is up for discussion.
Depending on whom you ask, the
NUS will be described in various
ways. Those in favour of joining
speak of it as a nice fluffy organisa-
tion of discount cards and individu-
als who dedicate their lives to the
student welfare cause. Others are
more sceptical, instead seeing it as
nothing but a talking shop for wan-

nabe waffle spewing politicians.
If we are going to have a debate
let’s go back to first principles and
try and define what the NUS is ac-
tually for. What does it mean for it
to be a “National Union”? Appar-
ently one of the benefits of joining
is that NUS representatives can
lobby ministers. I find this a rather
strange concept since education
policy has now been devolved to
Edinburgh and Cardiff. This makes
it a bit silly for the NUS to claim
that it can effectively lobby on be-
half of the whole of the country. If
they let the Scots join in the party
then why not the French, Mexican
or Sri Lankan universities? The
truth is that the NUS spends a lot
of time (and students’ money) on
debating and passing motions with
little direct relevance to us. Accord-
ing to NUS records in January 2006
a motion was passed which seems
to give them a mandate to cam-
paign against the renewal of Brit-
ain’s nuclear deterrent. Pros and
cons of nuclear weapons aside, I’m
sure we can all agree that this has
absolutely nothing to do with life on
campus. It just serves to illustrate
how useless an organisation it is
when the NUS has absolutely no
impact on the issues that matter,
such as top up fees, but its officers
seem to have plenty of time to waste
debating and campaigning on what
could best be described as ethical
niceties. I would love to be paid to
sit around to pontificate the world
but I don’t think its an appropriate
use of our money.
Now we need to discuss what it
means these days to be a student.
A recent league table ranks Impe-
rial as one of the worlds leading
academic institutions. This should

ts 6.45am. Most students are
still asleep or just crawling
into bed but for the poor sod
that is the third year medical
student, life is different. The
daily grind consists of early morn-
ings and late evenings in a place
where anonymity and lack of iden-
tity is rife. Where one is expected
to enjoy humiliation, where the
expectation is to don a white coat
and creep to impress seniors. One
should not speak one’s mind or talk
out of place. One should be seen
and not heard. One should only
speak when spoken to. One is ex-
pected to accept that they are insig-
nificant and should remain humble
and grateful if anyone notices them.
One should understand the concept
that the Consultant is God, the only
God and that no other God exists.
One should always be God-fearing.
God is always right, God is allowed
to be late and God is allowed to bul-
ly you and say what he likes about
you in front of the angels that work
for him. God is not so merciful and
forgiving anymore.
The angels rush about stressed
and sweaty, taking blood, asking
patients ‘targeted questions’ and
squirm whenever God enters the
ward looking angry. The difference
between this God and these an-
gels and those that are believed to
reside in what is currently a grey
and cloudy sky is that key desirable
qualities (compassion and empa-
thy) have faded. The focus of hos-
pital medicine is somewhat corrupt
– it’s less about care for the patient
and more about personal profit.
Competitiveness is the universal
theme, a drive to be the best aca-
demic, the best at networking. It’s
terribly ironic that in a place which
is meant to be about caring for peo-
ple who are sick; caring people are
far from being omnipresent. Hu-
manity, also, is a rare gem. The job
has become a lot more mechanical,
a robot could do it now – actually,
some robots are doing it now.
Doctors and medical students
seem more geared towards self-
ish gain than patient care. ‘Doctor’
comesfromtheLatinword“docere”
meaning “to teach’’. Shouldn’t doc-
tors be using their knowledge to
help people? I went into Medicine
thinking it was about being part of a
service to others. I thought doctors
would show humility and compas-
sion. I was naïve enough to think
that doctors and medical students
would have a genuine motive be-
hind their work and actions.
Only now, dumped in the midst
of it all, do I realise that being a
thoughtful, attentive and caring
doctor is not easy in the hospital
environment. It takes someone who
has decided to train as a doctor out
of sincerity. It takes someone who
can endure all the financial and time
pressures that the NHS prescribes
sparingly and free of charge, some-
one who can rise above the dog-eat-
dog, back-stabbing environment. It
takes someone who wants to care.
Unfortunately, it seems that this
model is temporarily out of stock
and too expensive for the NHS.
So you think you want to be a doctor?

W
hen joining any
wardening team
you’re bound to
get told that it is
a stressful but
fulfilling experience, that you need
to keep your wits about you at all
time and that the first weeks can
be very hectic. It is this last point
that invariably gets overlooked.
When the hall seniors move in you
end up in some sort of a teambuild-
ing scenario – rafting, paintball,
camping, depending on the War-
den’s levels of sadism – and start
doing a million and one things that
transform a hall from a hostel into
something approaching a home.
Now, Piccadilly Court is what we
call an “outlying” hall, which usual-
ly leads to a large number of ques-
tions before term starts, that go
along the lines of: “I really hoped
to live next door to College and roll
straight out of bed into the lecture
hall. Could you do something about
it? Yours truly, xxx”. To which I
usually reply with a reflection on
the beneficial aspects of book-read-
ing on the Piccadilly Line. Adding
a book recommendation, if I feel
wordy. Still, once people move in,
they tend to see the good sides of
their predicament too – the West
End, Camden, a 55” plasma screen
and a courtyard to name a few.
The idea of the first week of term
is to get students to meet as many
other residents as possible. There
are some tried and tested ways of
achieving this, like the boat party.
The principle underlying the boat
party is that a group of people will
turn to each other for comfort and
support, if left with no other option.
Since our budget does not allow
us to stage a fully-fledged Lost
re-enactment and hire a tropical
island, placing everyone on a boat
for good five hours is an acceptable
alternative. Our crowd this year
seemed to have enjoyed them-
selves, helped by an enthusiastic
DJ who took upon herself to teach
the entire room some latino moves.
Later this term we’ll be taking the
students to a gala evening with a
masquerade theme and to a string
of other events. The other, less
visible but more important, side
of wardening starts now as well.
Many of the students who moved
in will run into problems with their
course, the new surroundings and
cultures. We try to step in when we
notice this happening and we are
always on hand for help. Plus, we
don’t mind being woken up at 3am
for a good reason. Honest.
