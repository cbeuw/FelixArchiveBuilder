The new Imperial College Union
website (www.imperialcollegeun-
ion.org) has proven to be a great
success over the last month, taking
almost £38,000 in club membership
and event ticket sales. The site has
also won praise within the more
technically inclined members of
the student body for conforming to
modern web standards.
The website cost £40,000 in total
to build, and went live at the start
of this term after extensive test-
ing over the summer vacation. The
Union bought extra capacity for the
site, in order to cope with the rush
that was expected after Freshers’
Fair with students joining and re-
joining clubs and societies. So far,
the site has coped admirably with
the almost 27,000 page impressions
per day.
Though the vast majority of pay-
ments for club membership went
through without problems, around
ten students found their payment
being declined when the system
was in fact taking payment. This
problem was identified quickly, as
the site is being closely monitored
to ensure it is functioning correctly,
and the money was returned to the
students without them even realis-
ing what had occurred.
In addition to the online payment
of club membership, the new site
has become a far more valuable re-
source for clubs and societies offic-
ers than the previous website. Some
club content is currently missing
from the site, though this is mainly
societies that are defunct, or did not
submit information for the Clubs &
Societies A to Z.
The response from students and
club officers has been strongly posi-
tive so far, with a number comment-
ing this reporter that the site has
“made our lives easier”. Instead
of having to fill out forms and cash
and track the money they receive
from club members, the online sys-
tem allows the money to be deposit-
ed directly into the clubs’ accounts.
Additionally, the Student Activities
Centre is encouraging students to
use the site to sign up members, as
it reduces the amount of paperwork
Union website up!
The new Union website has proved to be worth the rather steep
asking price, comparing favourably with UCLU’s new site
their student volunteer staff has to
deal with. However, not enough stu-
dents are using the site to sign up
yet, though the number is rapidly
increasing as awareness of the new
functionality spreads.
The new University College Lon-
don Union (UCLU) website report-
edly cost around £80,000, or twice
the amount that the Union paid for
the new site, and has been widely
criticised on the UCL campus for
being, as one disgruntled student
put it, “crap”.
Sabbatical team in disarray?
Tempers are running high in the
sabb team, with tensions reaching
a head on Tuesday, with at least two
members of the team drafting res-
ignation letters.
At Council on Monday evening,
the sabbaticals and the Felix Edi-
tor presented their first reports,
detailing their actions over the pre-
ceding months to those attending.
The Deputy President (Graduate
Students), Shama Rahman, faced
a number of questions from several
members of Council, including her
fellow sabbaticals.
Questions were put to Ms Rah-
man during the presentation of her
report about the upcoming Gradu-
ate Student Association (GSA) elec-
tions. So far the elections are giving
every appearance of becoming a
farce, as the traditional publicity
for the elections has been minimal,
and only one person is standing,
in the role of Communications Of-
ficer. Asked if she knew how many
people were standing for positions,
she replied that she did not know to
a somewhat stunned Council and
referred the question to the Union
President, John Collins.
A member of the sabbatical team
raised questions over Ms Rahman’s
performance at Freshers’ Fair
where she was manning the GSA
stall.ItisreportedbyFelix’ssources
that Ms Rahman arrived well after
the fair started, and was seen pack-
ing up at around 3pm. This no doubt
antagonised the other sabbaticals,
who were clearly visible on the site
from set-up to tear-down. Mr Lai’s
report to Council also noted that he
had received complaints about the
GSA stall.
Felix has learned that, allegedly,
some sabbaticals drafted their
resignation letters after Council,
though it is not clear whether this
is in protest at what they perceive
as Ms Rahman’s poor performance
in recent weeks, or whether they
feel the team is no longer viable.
The sabbaticals contacted by this
reporter denied that any resigna-
tions would be taking place.
In Ms Rahman’s defence, she did
not have a handover, and the cur-
rent team could not rely on Luis
Hui, the previous DPGS, to provide
training. Some disgruntled hacks
have suggested that perhaps the
other members of the sabb team
should have made more effort to
ensure Ms Rahman understood
her role.
IC ranked 9th in the world
Imperial College is the ninth best
university in the world according
to the latest Times Education Sup-
plement, having soared from thir-
teenth place in last year’s survey to
become the only newcomer in this
year’s top ten.
Most of the leading universities
have maintained their positions
with Harvard retaining the top
spot above Cambridge and Oxford,
which ranked second and third
place respectively. Indeed, Ameri-
can institutions continue to domi-
nate, filling 11 out of the top 20 slots
as well as being well-represented
throughout the table. However, de-
spite their world-beating private
funding, this year America has
given way to a greater number of
European and Asian universities in
the top 20. Furthermore, the seem-
ingly unbeatable Harvard Univer-
sity has reduced its lead from a
sizable 10% to less than 4% from its
nearest rival.
Imperial’s rector, Sir Richard
Sykes, has commended Imperial’s
high ranking: “this underlines Im-
perial’s status as an internationally
leading centre of knowledge and
scholarship, and is an excellent po-
sition from which to enter our Cen-
tenary year. Above all, it’s a tribute
to the world-class staff we are able
to attract, both academic and non-
academic, and I hope all members
of our community will join with me
in celebrating.” Imperial’s recent
decision to split from the Univer-
sity of London and become inde-
pendent by 2007, its centenary year,
is reinforced by the Times’ results,
given that they far outranked all
other London institutions: LSE fin-
ished at seventeenth place, UCL at
25 and Kings College at 46.
Whether or not prospective stu-
dents choosing universities can rely
on these figures is debatable. The
difficulty of sourcing truly interna-
tional data and agreeing on a com-
prehensive framework has meant
that global ranking of universities
still remains a controversial issue.
Yet, in the face of increased globali-
sation, there is a definite need for a
reliable ranking system as univer-
sities shape an international iden-
tity for themselves. But different
methodologies and criteria have
led to many different lists that have
variable rankings for the same uni-
versity. In Newsweek, for example,
Imperial was ranked considerably
lower in seventeenth place.
The Times ranking is based on
both qualitative and quantitative
measures including but not limited
to: peer review by academics, the
number of citations per academic
and the ratio of students to aca-
demic staff. Encompassing both re-
search and teaching quality, it aims
to give a reliable picture of where
universities stand on an interna-
tional platform.

Felix shortlisted five times in
four categories for Guardian
Student Media Awards 2006
Felix and its staff have been short-
listed in the prestigious Guardian
Student Media Awards. The news-
paper itself was shortlisted in the
“Newspaper of the Year” category.
Felix’s companion science maga-
zine, I, Science, was shortlisted in
the “Magazine of the year”. The
Felix editorial team of the previous
year have also been nominated indi-
vidually. In what may surprise some
of those he antagonised in the Un-
ion and College, the previous editor,
Rupert Neate, has been nominated
twice, in the “Reporter of the Year”
category, and the “Travel writer of
the year” category. Mr Neate made
this comment to Felix: “I am over
the moon that Felix has been nomi-
nated for so many awards. I would
like to thank everyone who worked
for Felix last year. It is thanks to
all of their hard work that we have
been shortlisted for these prestig-
ious awards. I’m elated to have re-
ceived this recognition as our hard
-hitting investigative journalism did
not win me many friends in College
or Union bureaucracy. I won’t miss
the all-nighters every Tuesday, but
it looks like they were worth it.”
Felix’s news editor during Mr
Neate’s term, Chris Miles, has also
been shortlisted in the “Reporter
of the year” category, giving Felix
two entries compared to one from
the other student newspapers
competing.

The Division of Biomedical Sciences
(BMS) is facing potential closure this
week, with expected job cuts and staff

Jobs under threat
Future of Biomedical Sciences Division left in the balance
ment the early stages of their medi-
cal training.
A worried BMS research associ-
ate working at the SAF told Felix:
“More people here are worried about
their jobs than who’s going to teach
the medical students. The morale is
plummeting.
“We used to be part of the Imperial
College School of Medicine (ICSM)
College security flaws
Security at the Faculty Building, hub
of College academic management
and workplace of the Rector, has been
exposed as inadequate and ineffec-
tive in light of a Felix investigation.
Felix reporters were able to enter
the ‘restricted’ building on two sepa-
rate occasions and were not chal-
lenged over their identity, whether
they were in fact members of
College or their purpose for entering
Imperial’s administrative headquar-
ters.
Entry to the building is usually con-
trolled by swipe card entry gates
that allow access to a select group
of College staff; these are adjacent
to a manned security desk at the
entrance of the modern four-storey
building and are the main access
points for all personnel entering and
leaving the Faculty building.
Reporters were waved past the
desk on entry and left to roam freely
around the floors coming within feet
of Sir Richard’s office and mixing
with employees at a nearby coffee
bar.
Empty offices with thousands of
pounds worth of equipment and
confidential documents were all in
potential reach of the reporters.
After spending over 30 minutes in the
building, Felix left and returned an
hour later to be greeted by a different
Chris Miles & Vitali Lazurenko receptionist who also granted access
without confirmation of prior appoint-
ments or identity.
Simon Davies, a first year physicist,
told Felix: “If College can’t keep the
Rector secure, what hope is there for
the student body?”
Samantha Perera, a second year
medical student, said: “Personally I
think far too much money is spent
on security as Imperial College and
the Rector are not high-risk terrorist
targets. The money could be better
spent on improving teaching facili-
ties.”
Concerned with such lapses in
College security, Felix also attempted
to gain access to restricted areas in
the Sir Alexander Fleming Building
(SAF) and Union offices. Once inside
the SAF, we were able to tailgate a
researcher into a restricted access
area without being challenged. We
subsequently had open access to
research labs, some of which con-
tained hazardous chemicals, as well
as expensive microscopy equipment.
Similar breaches occurred in the
Sabbatical offices, where no atten-
tion was paid as reporters passed
the Union reception and into the
unlocked vacant office of Deputy
President (Education and Welfare)
Sarah Khatib. Various valuables were
left unattended in the room, in direct
contravention to advice issued at the

“There are no proposals to change
our medical undergraduate courses
and we are looking forward to intro-
ducing our new Biomedical Science
course and subsequently graduate
entry medical course. Discussions
are continuing and the College will
