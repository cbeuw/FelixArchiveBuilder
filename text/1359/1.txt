Wye student
injured after
drink contest
A student was badly injured, and
several others placed in danger, at
a freshers’ event at Imperial Col-
lege’s Wye campus when a “breath-
testing night” got out of hand.
Wye’s outgoing exec organised a
Freshers’ Ball for the new students
at the campus, with one of the
nights being based around breatha-
lysing students who were drinking
in the campus’ bar. When informed
by the exec of their plans, the Un-
ion President, John Collins, ini-
tially banned the event from taking
place. However, the exec promised
Mr Collins that the breathalyser
would be “used as an educational
tool” to demonstrate the effects of
alcohol on those who are not used
to over-indulging, and to raise
awareness of drink-driving, which
has been a concern in Wye over the
years. The advertising for the event
was amended to reflect this, and
subsequently Mr Collins allowed
the event to go ahead. The staff at
the campus, including the assist-
ant wardens, asked the exec not to
run the event, but this request was
declined.
A case of beer was offered as a
prize for the person who scored the
highest on the breath testing ma-
chine. The winner, who has not been
named, scored 2.4 on the meter, in-
dicating a very high blood alcohol
content (BAC). The student, a first
year, was walking home from the
event, when he fell backwards and

cut his head open “quite badly”, ac-
cording to the assistant warden at
Wye Campus. The students he was
walking with took him to a nearby
hall of residence, where College
Security were called. Security then
called an ambulance and alerted
the campus authorities. At the time
the ambulance arrived, the student
was in a semi-conscious state.
The student was rushed to the
nearby William Harvey Accident &
Emergency department and was
placed in the Clinical Decision Unit
(CDU) where he was monitored
overnight and into the next day.
Another student was found lying
in the main road near the campus,
apparently unaware of his situa-
tion. A group of students found him
and took him home, supervised by
College Security, who made sure
that when the student passed out
he was laid on his side in bed, and
that his friends stayed with him.
The event has been heavily criti-
cised by both the Union and Col-
lege authorities, with one member
of Wye’s campus staff calling it “ir-
responsible and dangerous”. The
Union President, John Collins, has
initiated disciplinary procedures
against the Wye President and
those responsible for the event,
adding that he was “extremely dis-
appointed” with the conduct of the
organisers. Concerns have also
been raised over the fact that stu-
dents were still being served in the
bar, despite being clearly drunk.
The disciplinary tribunal is sched-
uled to take place on 16 October.
There is some doubt over who will
be implicated in any possible dis-
ciplinary measures, given that the
Wye campus is unusual in that the
outgoing exec organises the fresh-
ers events rather than the incom-
ing exec, as is the case at South
Kensington campus.
The Union’s disciplinary proce-
dures cannot remove a student’s
membership of the Union, and
cannot expel them from the Col-
lege. The Union Council can, how-
ever, remove them from their post
should evidence of negligence be
presented at the tribunal. The most
severe punishment the tribunal
can impart on those reponsible is
to hand the matter over to a Col-
lege disciplinary committee, which
has the authority to expel a student
from the College. However, this is
unlikely in this case.
Rector tops out
new Southside hall
“Breath testing night” leaves one student in hospital after fall
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, buried a sprig of yew in the last
beam of the new Southside building last Thursday as part of
a traditional building rite. The yew is supposed to bring good
fortune to those that use the building in future. Sir Richard
commented on how quickly planning permission was obtained
to demolish the Grade 2 listed building that occupied the site.
The hall, “the best hotel in South Kensington” according to Sir
Richard, will be open to house students at the start next year.
Drinking culture in Britain
The drinking culture of this
country has been a concern for
this government, with some
predicting the liberalisation of
drinking hours would result in
a mass increase in street crime.
However, recent studies in the
borough of Westminster have
seen a substantial fall in the
number of “violence against a
person” incidents once drink-
ing hours changed. However, a
European cafe-style culture is
still a long way off.
