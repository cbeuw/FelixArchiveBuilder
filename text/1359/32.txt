Going underground with IC Caving

Only nine months since I started
caving, here I was: the first person
ever to set foot in this passageway,
200 metres below the surface of an
Austrian mountain.
I was there with members of Im-
perial College Caving Club, and this
was the final trip of the expedition.
We had passed an obstacle that
stopped us last time, a 9m vertical
drop in the cave floor. My caving
buddy hammered a bolt into the
wall and we tied on a rope so we
could abseil down. Once at the bot-
tom we were in a never-before ex-
plored part of the cave, walking into
the unknown.
Clambering over the boulder
strewn ground we noticed the
gaps between the rocks, wedged
together 2m above the ‘real’ floor.
Unsure how stable our footing was
we treaded with caution further
into the cave. We felt the charac-
ter of the passage change; an ee-
rie draught started sucking along
the passage, our voices starting to
echo off something a very long way
away. As we passed the last cor-
ner we suddenly emerged into the
blackness, our lights swallowed up
by the sheer enormity of the chasm
that opened up before us.
We hurled a chunk of rock into
the pit, counting the seconds until
it reached the floor. One… two…
Still nothing. Three… boom, rat-
tle, rattle! Fifty metres deep. This
was a real monster, and would need
more time to conquer than we had.
Longer underground would risk
worrying the rest of the team who
awaited our return, snug in our
mountain-top camp, so we had to
leave. Five hours later the two of
us were standing at the entrance
to the cave, cold and exhausted but
with an immense sense of achieve-
ment. We staggered back to our
camp, navigating by cairns that
had been erected over the previ-
ous 4 weeks in good time to join our
friends around the campfire, to chat
elatedly about our discoveries over
fantastically warming curry before
collapsing into our sleeping bags.
Does the cave continue beyond
that last enormous drop? Nobody
knows. There could be kilometres
more to find, or it could end around
the next corner. It will take another
expedition in another year to find
out – only this time you could be
there as well.
Although caving is certainly chal-
lenging, both physically and psycho-
logically, it is neither competitive
nor macho. Caving is the perfect
team sport: since everyone’s safety
depends on the group, there is no
room for showing off. The aim is to
use people’s different skills in coop-
eration, to further common goals
of exploration and enjoyment. No
prior experience is required: all the
necessary training is done within
the club, drawing on the experience
of our older members. All trips are
tailored to the skills and wishes of
those taking part and you will never
be asked to do things that you are
unhappy with or that we do not feel
you are ready for yet.
ICCC runs regular weekend trips
to caving destinations around the
UK – usually costing £25-30 in-
clusive of all training, equipment,
transportation, accommodation,
food and leadership. As well as
our summer expedition (normally
to Slovenia), we have a week-long
tour in Easter to somewhere warm,
and long-weekends to destinations
around Europe in the spring and
summer. We meet weekly on Tues-
days in the Union from 7.30pm to
discuss past events and future ex-
cursions over a pint or two. There
will also be additional rope-climb-
ing practice in the trees in Princes
Gardens during this term.

Snow? Underground? How wonderfully bizarre. Watch you don’t slip, my son.
