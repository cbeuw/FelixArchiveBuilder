Caffeine addict confessions
Illegal, immoral, and worth as much as oil. Well after all, heroin is so passé
Gosh! You mean after a whole
week of lectures you still want
more? Well, you’ve picked
a good week for it. Starting
tonight, at 18.30, David Bullock
is talking about “Conservation
on the grand scale” at Birkbeck
College. Be there, or be what-
ever is the opposite of green.
If you’re a scientist, but want
to make money, find out how
on October 17 at the Tanaka
Business School. Dr John Has-
sard, an Imperial alumnus, is
coming to talk about his very
successful company deltadot.
The event is free, sponsored by
IC Entrepreneurs.
For over 18s only, the Dana
Centre is holding a two-day
event “Fairground: Thrill Labo-
ratory-Pleasure” starting Octo-
ber 17. The event costs £10 and
includes live experimentation
on the “Miami Trip” as well as
canapés, fizzy pop, oh, and a
number of talks.
And finally: reading list look-
ing too long? No need to read
the entire IC library, just mosey
on down to G16, Sir Alexander
Fleming Building at 6.30pm on
Thursday, October 19, hand
over your £8, and listen to Dr
Armand Leroi, Maggie McDon-
ald, and Tim Radford who’ll tell
you what you need in their talk
“The best science books ever”.

It’s illegal in parts of Northern
Thailand, hospitals and universi-
ties run on it, endurance athletes
enhance their performance with it,
and 300 years ago, it could be used
as grounds for divorce. Only the oil
industry has a greater volume of
worldwide trade. As I drain my cof-
fee cup a fourth time this evening
and feel renewed strength running
through my veins, I look back at
the humble caffeine molecule, and
what makes it so dear to our faster
beating hearts.
The story goes that around
850BC, an Ethiopian goat herder,
Kaldi, noticed his goats getting high
on some pretty red berries, and de-
cided to give them a taste himself.
The craze soon spread, and before
long coffee trees were being grown
all along the Arabian peninsular.
The drink soon took on religious
connotations, being used as a medi-
tative drink within the Muslim tra-
dition. It was so sacred that those
caught drinking coffee in Constan-
tinople, home of the world’s first
coffee house, were beaten the first
time, and if caught again, thrown
into the river sewn in a leather bag
to drown.
The caffeine molecule itself mim-
ics the shape of adenosine, a neu-
rotransmitter involved in suppress-
ing many cell pathways. It binds
to adenosine receptor molecules
in the synapse, allowing chemical
pathways to continue unhindered,
hence caffeine’s stimulatory role.
An overdose can be fatal, and even
at ‘normal’ (student) consumption,
caffeine can result in reduced fine
motor co-ordination, increased
heart rate, insomnia, nervous-
ness and dizziness. The blocking
of adenosine receptors causes the
body to manufacture extra ones to
compensate, so a drop of caffeine
causes oversensitivity to the neu-
rotransmitter. This results in a dra-
matic drop in blood pressure, lead-
ing to the ‘give me coffee’ headache
around half past three.
It’s not all bad though. A cup of
coffee a day makes you significant-
ly less likely to top yourself, and it
does wonders for the sex life of the
elderly.
Meanwhile, a tiny espresso taken
with a Gaulouises and a hefty dose
of French philosophy is almost
certain to get you laid in certain
circles, and even the most dyed-in-
the-silicon computer scientist won’t
mistake the meaning behind ‘Do
you fancy coming up for a coffee?’
So put the kettle on, put your feet
up, and give thanks to the humble
coffee bean, preamble of first dates
and saviour of students. After all,
heroin is so passé.
