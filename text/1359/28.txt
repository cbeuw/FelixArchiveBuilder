Civil Engineers explore El Salvador
Repairing the earthquake of 2001 with an NGO in El Salvador; concrete, gangs, spiders and more concrete

n 2001 several large mag-

the small Central Ameri-
can Republic of El Sal-
vador. The effects were
devastating on an already
struggling country where
civil war had ended less
than two decades earlier. In 2002,
students from Civil Engineering at
IC volunteered to work on a devel-
opment project in one of the poor-
est communities. Since then, the
project has developed into a pio-
neering annual student-community
participation scheme working with
a local Non Government Organisa-
tion (NGO).
The volunteering projects, work-
ing with the Salvadorian NGO,
REDES, involve students from sev-
eral universities and disciplines.
Students travel to El Salvador and
work with the community for five
to seven weeks on various develop-
ment projects.
Over the past five years the
projects have included a seismical-
ly resistant adobe pre-school, con-
crete block model house, construc-
tion of pit and compost latrines,
construction of drainage pits, re-
taining walls, steel frame houses
and various social welfare projects.
This year’s team, comprising of
11 students of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department (first year to PhD)
and two architecture students from
UCL, travelled to El Salvador to
work on four separate projects. The
project was completely organised
by the students and funding gained
from industrial sponsorship. Once
again, it was in conjunction with
REDES but also included other
NGOs in keeping with the group’s
hope to expand. These projects in-
cluded the expansion of a school
and nursery in Santa Marta, a radio
station in Victoria and a compost la-
trine project in Pepto, Gualcimaca.
A bit about the
projects
The projects in Santa Marta include
the construction of more class-
rooms in their local high school
and nursery - over time we came
to know these as the Escuela and
la Guarderia. As many of the older
generation were lost to the war,
Santa Marta is a fairly a youthful
village being largely populated by
people under 20. Thus the school is
important in bringing together and
strengthening the community.
Outside of Santa Marta, in the
closest town, our other project in
Victoria required us to build a new
radio station. The objective was to
help the community rebuild their
radio station, a valuable corner-
stone to the surrounding isolated
villages like Santa Marta. It pro-
vides information about the outside
world such as current affairs, pub-
lic services and announcements
that are free from government cen-
sorship. A new and larger station
would provide extra room for more
volunteers to work and large ar-
eas to hold seminars and education
programs for the local people.
“It has been over six weeks since
I returned from El Salvador, and
how can anyone forget: making
concrete in blistering heat, be-
ing stalked by little monkey kids
during dinner, having your life
flash before your eyes when en-
countering the local gangsters,
watching a guy taking a dump
in his own backyard (while he
was suppose to be ‘mining’ for
aggregate), fabricating our own
building tools and, of course, our
favourite pastime in El Salvador,
making sweet and sexy concrete.
In one of the most beautiful yet
troubled countries I have ever
encountered, I have had one of
the greatest experiences of my
life. And if anyone were to em-
bark on this trip, they will never
forget this lovely country and the
lovely people that live in it.”

“I’m currently spending fourth
year in Paris and responsible for
inflicting a bunch of students on
a country with worse things to
worry about. I went to El Salva-
dor in 2003 and had such a good
time I decided to go back. I miss
the banter with the various char-
acters we worked with, my lively
family and kicking back at the
tienda after work with a well de-
served pilsener. With this project
you get out what you put in and
more, so would recommend it to
anyone who doesn’t mind a few
spiders in their boots.”

“It was seeing the report from the
group who went out in 2004 that
made me decide to come to El Sal-
vador. I think I was seduced by the
picturesque sunny beaches and
lush green mountains and the idea
of working on such an exotic con-
struction site; it felt like the furthest
place possible from London. There
was much more to the El Salvador
project than manual labour. We had
dinner in the home of a famous El
Salvadorian artist, attempted to
learn salsa in the clubs of San Sal-
vador. I had such an amazing time I
didn’t really want leave.”

Our fourth project brought us
with CIRES (a different NGO) to a
remote settlement called Pepeto
North East of Chalatenango. It
could only be reached on foot or in
a 4x4 on a good day meaning trans-
portation of building materials was
tricky. CIRES, unlike REDES, con-
cern themselves with medical aid
and they are not engineers. Their
projects mainly raise health aware-
ness and supply aid to places which
have no free government care due
to inaccessibility.
Our aim was to build five compost
latrines to improve health thereby
reduce disease and illness such as
diarrhoea, vomiting, headaches
and dizziness.
The extent to which the commu-
nity was deprived meant that sani-
tary facilities were very limited and
we had to walk for ten minutes to
get a wash.
This village had little in the way
of hygiene and sanitation, conse-
quently providing compost latrines
is a big step forwards. Unlike the
projects at Santa Marta and Victo-
ria where we had a Maestro, here,
we were given full flexibility for the
engineering of the latrines. The
concrete mix, the foundation size
and the mortar and blocking of the
latrines were all coordinated by
ourselves.
Next year’s group
There is great potential for future
years. This year’s group had man-
aged to establish and strengthened
more ties with local NGO’s and new
communities in El Salvador.
The various projects in conjunction
with ADES, CIRES and REDES for
2007 could include: water collec-
tors near San Miguel; libraries and
computer labs for schools; and con-
struction work with El Salvadorian
Students.
Though the structures designed
by REDES are modern block and
reinforced concrete buildings the
only thing not so modern about it
was the way in which they were
built. Excavations, concrete mixing
and pouring, bar bending and soil
compacting were all done by hand.
But this experience isn’t only about
manual labour.
REDES feel that this volunteer
programme is as much about our
experiencing the country and its
culture as about the engineering
side. They organise a punishing
schedule of tourist excursions that
you would never get out of a guide
book, from Mayan ruins to the
beach and also talking to some of
the most interesting people you are
ever likely to meet. With the work
during the week you can sometimes
feel like time off.
It may not be a large country but
you’ll soon realise that six weeks is
not long enough.

We returned from El Salvador
about one and a half months ago
and since then a lot of people
have asked me about the trip. I
have not yet been able to find the
words to make others see what a
wonderful time I had as all these
“you should have been there”
stories come to my head. Work
was quite hard under the burn-
ing sun, but even that was fun.
I could not actually believe that
making concrete and digging can
be so enjoyable, although then
the weekends came and it was
even greater with a lot of sight-
seeing, Pilseners and rum!
