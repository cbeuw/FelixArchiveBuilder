Solving a crossword takes consid-
erably more skill, intellect, time
and, quite frankly, charm than does
solving a sudoku. This much is
self-evident.
However, those with the where-
withall to solve are clearly deserv-
ing of a good deal more recognition
than they have received until now,
comparable to the sudoku’s ethos
of a “small prize”.
Something along the lines of a
parade in honour of the successful
solver would be in order, I feel. And
a choice of memory stick or case
of beer too, perhaps. That doesn’t
seem unreasonable to me.
This week’s clues, however, most
certainly are. Scarecrow

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
You have the feel-
ing that your room
mate watches you
whilst you sleep. You
set up your webcam
to record him in the
night. To your horror you manage
to record 72 hours of badger mat-
ing calls. You ask to switch rooms,
immediately.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
This week you infil-
trate North Korea.
Having eaten a plate
of the country’s finest
battered schnauzer,
your skin begins to
boil and bubble. A song breaks out
of your crackled lips: “Bow-wow-
wow yippy yo, yippy yay, where my
dogs at? Bark with me now.”
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
You join the Armenian
mafia. They want 50
golden statuettes of
Elvis and 19 pints of
blood from an epilep-
tic chimp or they are
taking both your kidneys. You are
caught in London Zoo, needle in
hand, by the rozzers and ironically
are shot in the kidneys.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You’re compelled
to buy a shiny axe.
However, you can only
offer a week old Mars
Bar to the owner. He
amazingly accepts
only for you to see said mouldy
confectionery on eBay going for
£3,092. You take your own life with
the axe.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (Jan 20 – Feb 18)
Your boyfriend begins
to find exotic calligra-
phy more attractive
than you. You attempt
to win him back by
having your body tat-
tooed with every known font. Now
so excited when he sees you he has
premature ejaculations. You hate
yourself and so does everyone else.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
You become obsessed
with fantasy novels.
and refer to every-
day objects such as
scissors as the “The
Might Blade of Twain
of Mount Xarthuria” and a cheese
drater as “The Hallowed Mesh of
Steel Pain”. Wizard Legadyk kills
you with an apple peeler.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
You finally unpack
your suitcase full
of clothes. Lying at
the bottom is your
Dad’s, russian bride’s,
Mum’s, sister’s,
pimp’s, prostitute’s G-string. You
try it on and discovering that it is
blood soaked. Draping it over your
face, the smell intoxicates you.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
A freak lab accident
causes small hairs to
grow on your skin and
you can stick to walls.
Sticky residue also ap-
pears on your wrists
even after a week of not doing the
bad thing to your good self. Hook
up with Kirsten Dunst. Make $114
million at your opening weekend.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
ROLF “Harris” MAO.
Bam! Headshot! Oh
yeah, you’re going
down bitch! LOL.
Wha-bam! Eat it!
Every final bit! Eat it!
Check me out! Oh yeah! You suck!
Owned! LMAO! Boom! Suck it
down! That’s that shit right there!
Boo ya… Coming, mom.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
I you-you-you-you-

play on my ol-ol-ol-ol
ban-jo-lo-lol. But,
n-n-n-n-n-n-now wow-

la-la-l-ings are bro lol-lol lo oken.
I-I-I-I can-can-can no-no-no-no-not
re-re-re-remember the rest of the
bloody words.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
You spend £3.12 on
food today in the
canteen. The grains
of rice begin to climb
over the mountain-
ous chicken breast
battleground. Coriander leaves are
flung from one side of the plate to
the other as war breaks out in your
Indian cuisine.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
You realise you joined
every society. You are
£2500 in debt. Con-
gratulations, dumb-
ass. You are a waste of
space. Watch yourself,
keep your back to the wall and
keep one eye open when you sleep.
People with scythes are coming for
your virginal blood.
