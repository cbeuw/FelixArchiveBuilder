There were a few more things to get
used to. Firstly, our strange hours:
up at 4 or 5am, bed at 6pm. Then
there was the mountain food: choc-
olate for breakfast (sometimes a bit
difficult to stomach!), peanuts and
raisins for lunch and a cooked meal
in the afternoon (a choice between
noodles, couscous or pasta with
tuna or corned beaf) plus powdered
deserts (custard being the favour-
ite). There were also lots of skills to
pick up from the more experienced
members of our group: crevasse
rescue (conducted at base camp,
care of a fairly rotten looking tree!),
ice-axe arrest (acts as a brake if you
fall over), how to walk in crampons,
how to tie into the rope and taking
care to avoid tripping over it.
For the majority of us, it was our
first experience at that altitude.
While no-one suffered severe ef-
fects, we all quickly learnt the im-
portance of looking after yourself
in that environment. When you
consider a mountaineer expends
300-800 calories and can lose up to
a litre of water an hour, you need to
eat and drink properly.
The second day on the glacier
was spent climbing up to the col
Emile Pic (3,483m), after which
we did a ridge traverse (over some
very lose rocks!) to Pic de Neige
Cordier (3,614m). Glissading down
from the col was definitely another
highlight. Rain back at camp sent
most of us sheltering in the tents,
but it didn’t stop Bernard, Matt and
Joe exploring some rock routes on
the slabs behind. More rain delayed
our start the following day, but it
cleared up later and we decided
to climb the ridge on the right side
of the col beneath Pic du Glacier
Blanc. This was quite exposed at
points, giving us fantastic aerial
views of the glacier below. Most of
us descended after the first part of
the ridge, but Alex, Ben, Bernard
and James continued up to the top.
We watched from camp as their tiny
silhouettes climbed on pinnacles
along the ridge. Our final day in the
mountains saw us tackle the Barre,
after which, everyone except for
Ben, Alex and Bernard went down
from the glacier. They stayed to
climb another ridge the next day
while the rest of us descended the
2,500m back to base camp for some
rest and relaxation.

“Come on, get up! Time to go!”
Alex’s 4am wake-up calls filtered
into my barely conscious head.
Sluggish limbs shook off sleep and
attempted to pull on clothes for the
mountain. Conditions were good:
we could set out to conquer our
highest peak yet. Boots were done
up, crampons fastened, backpacks
put on, the rope tied into, and soon
we were off on the 1½ hour walk to
the base of the beast: the Barre des
Ecrins peak.
We trudged single file in the dark-
ness, illuminating sparkling snow
with our head torches, treading
carefully over the crevasses. Ar-
riving at the base of our climb, we
set a steady pace and managed to
overtake many of the other people
on the same route. Our three hour
ascent took us past amazing snow
sculptures (‘meringue’ formations),
a particularly deep crevasse, and
close to the summit, a long row of
huge icicles hanging precariously.
All our efforts were rewarded by the
incredible views at the top: moun-
tains extended in every direction.
We were on the highest point for
miles around - 4,015m to be precise!
In the very distance, mountain ridg-
es looked unreal, with a two-dimen-
sional, cardboard cutout quality. For
most of us, this was the mental and
physical high point of the trip. This
years Outdoor Club summer tour
to the Ecrins National Park in the
southern French Alps was a truly
action packed two weeks, where
activities such as mountaineering,
hiking, rock climbing and mountain
biking were experienced.
A couple of days after our arrival,
we seized a weather window and
eagerly headed up to the glacier. Af-
ter a couple of hours walk we set up
camp above the Glacier Blanc ref-
uge (2542m) to allow us to acclima-
tise. The next day started at 6.30am
– for all except Bernard, that is,
who had to be shaken from his biv-
vy – something that became a fairly
regular occurrence on the trip! We
continued our trek up, arriving at
the base of the glacier Blanc, where
we donned crampons and walked
up the path past huge fissures and
crevasses. By the time we had set
up camp, complete with an expertly
crafted snow wall, it was still early
so we got in some practice by walk-
ing up to the col beneath Pic du Gla-
cier Blanc (3,463m).
Our four days spent on the gla-
cier transported us into a different
world. It was a desert of snow and
rock; freezing at night and burning
hot by day - I was naive in thinking
I’d never get a sun tan on a glacier!
