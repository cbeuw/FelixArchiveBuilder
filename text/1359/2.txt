“After a summer lazing about
watching The Apprentice or
Dragon’s Den you could be
forgiven if you thought starting
a company was simply glorified
self-humiliation. A dynamic new
organisation created by active
student entrepreneurs from within
Imperial wants to change that for
the better.”

department to close
The University of Reading is to
close its physics department by
2010, with this month’s intake of 30
students being its last.
A review of the subject by the Uni-
versity suggested that it was “no
longer viable”, having recruited
just 30 students for 42 places. The
University’s press statement ex-
pressed regret at having to make
the decision to close the depart-
ment, adding that this was brought
about by “the current funding con-
text” for higher education insti-
tutions in UK, requiring that the
limited resources of the university
should be focussed on “academic
areas of comparative strength”,
suggesting financial woes are the
reason for the decision.
The Institute of Physics (IOP) has
been very critical of the decision,
with Science Director Peter Main
saying: “The Institute of Physics
deeply regrets the proposed closure
of Reading University’s physics
department.” In an interview with
the Guardian, Mr Main discussed
the impact of the A-level choice
of sixth-formers in determining
which subjects would be funded:
“the future of Britain’s science base
rests on the university choices of
sixth-formers.”
The IoP’s press release warned
that if universities continue to al-
low physics departments to close,
there would be a shortage of physi-
cists within a few years. The Insti-
tute says that since 2001, 30% of
university physics departments
have either closed or merged. The
last department to be closed was at
Newcastle University, in December
2004, which sparked controversy
within the national press.
The head of the department, Pro-
fessor John Blackman, said that he
had been fielding calls and visits
from unhappy students and par-
ents concerned over the future of
their course. He made clear in a
statement that no current students
would be affected by the closure,
and that any student enrolled in the
course would be given a chance to
complete it.
The decision to close the depart-
ment will not be taken until the Uni-
versity Council meets in December.
Professor Blackman, commenting
on whether the decision will be con-
firmed, commented that this would
depend on the reaction to it: “We
will wait to see whether the uni-
versity feels that the whole thing is
worth a rethink.”
Opposition to the plans has been
strong both on and off campus.
Dave Lewis, President of Read-
ing University Students’ Union
(RUSU), sent an email to the entire
student body, questioning the valid-
ity of the university’s decision, say-
ing that the union was “shocked,
appalled and disappointed”. He re-
fers to an earlier statement by the
university, stating that they were
committed to a future for physics at
Reading, made six months ago, and
that the arguments presented then
for keeping the department open
(good student satisfaction, good
financial income, and strategic im-
portance) are still valid today. He
also organised a number of events
and talks, including as speakers
Professor Blackman, the head of
the Student Physics Society, and
representatives from university
management. RUSU has also set
up a blog, physicsatreading.blogs-
pot.com, which keeps students up
to date on developments.
The department has recently re-
ceived a £5m investment, which
went into refurbishing laboratories,
and the creation of a high-tech ul-
tra-fast laser lab and advanced
microscopy centre. In addition, the
department, in collaboration with
the chemistry department, has
received two out of 40 Research
Council UK Academic Fellowships,
which are “designed to reward in-
stitutions with innovative research
strategies”. These two posts were
advertised in the same week as the
closure, and remain on the Reading
Physicswebsite.Manystudentsand
staff are puzzled at the rationale be-
hind the closure when the depart-
ment appears to be succeeding.
The closure also ignores a rec-
ommendation made by the Science
and Technology Select Committee,
a parliamentary committee, that “it
should be mandatory for universi-
ties to alert Hefce [High Education
Funding Council for England] to
proposed departmental closures
in Stem subjects not less than 18
months before the changes in pro-
vision are due to come into effect”.
In April 2006, Reading University
assured students and staff that
physics was central to its plans,
and abandoned this view “without
consultation” according to RUSU’s
statement.
Physics and chemistry depart-
ments around the country have
been under threat for several years,
with admissions falling as under-
graduates settle for what are seen
as “easier” degrees.
No, that’s not photoshopped – some students have decided to steal the P from the physics building.
