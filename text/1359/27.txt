During my first two years at Impe-
rial, I became depressingly aware
of the Imperial College students’
apathy.
During anti-war campaigns we
went unnoticed in the hoards of
students who had travelled from
around the UK. At the Campaign
against Climate Change, five year
old children were clearly more
entertained, and entertaining,
throughout the march.
But worst of all, and this the
freshers should particularly look
down on us for, at the top-up fees
marches our Students’ Union took
no significant role in representing
the students and we ourselves nev-
er lifted a finger.
As a result of this apathy, places
like Southside have become mere
legends to most student. For those
who had the pleasure of experienc-
ing the halls (and bar) you will nev-
er forget their intricate maze-like
design. It was possibly the easiest
building to get lost in, yet as a result
one of the most fun to walk into.
But Southside should teach us
all a good lesson. Imperial was not
always the dull quiet place that it
is today. It would probably shock
most of you to find that Southside
was designed to prevent riots.
Scarily enough, it would probably
shock the students who first lived
in Southside even more to find that
our generation did nothing more
than sign a petition when the halls
were knocked down and the bars
closed forever.
As former Felix editor, Rupert
Neate, wrote on the subject “even
in my wildest imagination I cannot
think of any cause against which we
Imperial students would riot. Per-
haps the library not being open 24
hours any more?!”
But I’m not here to complain
about our students, I’m here to en-
courage people to be a little more
like our predecessors: a little more
vocal. We are not a lost, but we
have to work a little harder at being
heard.
As many may already know last
year the Environmental Society or-
ganised the first ever Green Week.
With a large group of students con-
cerned with the College’s disregard
for its own environmental responsi-

Raising our voices
bilities, Green Week aimed to raise
awareness and asked the College
to committee to certain targets. As
a result, this is the first year that
students can find recycling in all
departments.
Others will also remember the
HIV/AIDS campaign Positively Red
Week organised by MedSIN, anoth-
er student society. The week was
filled with workshops and lectures
and the students flaunted Red rib-
bons to show support for the cause.
In the coming year, this section
hopes to become an open arena for
discussing topics varying from glo-
bal health to global warming and
from education to poverty.
Societies are welcome to write
about their events and campaigns,
the purpose of this section is for
you to have a means to communi-
cate with students. Individuals are
equally welcome to speak their
minds or tell a story.
I encourage all students and staff
to be a little less apathetic than we
have recently been and bring back
the Southside spirit by raising their
voices and sharing your views. Who
knows, maybe some time in the fu-
ture the College will have to rebuild
Southside so as to cage the beasts
that are Imperial students.
In the spirit of Southside… let us defeat Imperial apathy
Southside: initially built to contain riots, but now this legend merely
represents a time when students still had an opinion.
Approximately 600 million people are at risk of contracting schistosomiasis becase they live in tropical
regions where water supply and sanitation are inadequate or non-existent.
Be a little less
apathetic and
bring back the
Southside spirit
by sharing your
views.
Medsin-Imperial is a group of stu-
dents motivated to raise awareness
of humanitarian and health related
issues on a global and local level by
organizing projects and campaigns,
and we have been running for more
than 8 years!
Medsin is the UK branch of the
International Federation of Medi-
cal Students’ Association (IFMSA),
made up of local branches at all
the major medical schools in the
country.
At Medsin-Imperial, through our
campaigns covering issues such as
HIV/AIDS and sanitation, we raise
awareness and lobby for change.
We also run a wide range of hands-
on projects throughout the year.
Learning sign language, teaching
Anenta Ratneswaren

CPR to children in schools, encour-
aging people to donate bone mar-
row or volunteering at orphanages
in the Balkans are just some of the
things you can get involved in, but
if that’s not enough, you could even
set up your own project.
Some of the many events and
activities we have planned for the
year include: Positively Red AIDS
Week, running from 26th November
to 1st December 2006, as well as the
new Global Health Forum, which
is a program of fortnightly Medsin
events aiming to stimulate interest
and promote awareness of impor-
tant issues in international health
through diverse talks, debates and
films.
Our first event this year, held last
Tuesday was ‘The Vicious Cycle
of Worms’, a lecture given by Prof
Alan Fenwick OBE. Professor Fen-
wick is a leading expert in tropical
parasitology and the direct of the
Schistosomiasis Control Initiative.
We have also just launched a
new project called Sexpression,
enabling medical students to raise
awareness about sexual health is-
sues both in local schools and with-
in the university.
If you’re interested in any of our
projects or campaigns, or if you just
