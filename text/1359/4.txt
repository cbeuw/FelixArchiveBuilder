This week’s business news
■ A US federal judge made an
historical ruling against tobacco
companies. A claim filed in 2004
alleged that products were mis-
leading consumers by marketing
“light” cigarettes as compara-
tively safe. The ruling in favour
of this claim could pave the way
for a class-action suit that would
include millions of smokers, mak-
ing it the largest civil law suit that
America has ever seen. Share
prices in tobacco companies fell
sharply.
■ Oil prices rallied after repre-
sentatives from the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries (OPEC) informally agreed
to cut output by 1 million barrels
per day. The move was the first
reduction since 2004, and was
widely anticipated after Nigeria
and Venezuela announced they
would step down production. The
move come amidst concerns that
oil prices would fall if the market
became oversupplied.
■ Eurozone interest rates are
likely to rise before the end of the
year. The comments came from
Jean-Claude Trichet of the Euro-
pean Central Bank (ECB) after
an meeting in Paris. A quarter of
a percent rise is set to come about
before the end of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage reached its highest level
since January 2000. Some econo-
mists are critical of the index’s
capacity as a barometer for the
US economy since it is comprised
of only thirty share prices.
■ Rupert Murdoch, owner of News
Corporation, announced plans to
release a version of MySpace™ in
You are going to pay me how much?
Jane is in her final year of Mechani-
cal Engineering. She has got a good
master’s degree coming, is the
president of two societies, and all
her friends say she is golden com-
pany. After three brain-crunching
years of polymers and stress-analy-
sis, the opportunities of the wide
world are open to her. NASA? Nah.
R&D? Wrong. No, Jane is off to be-
come an investment banker. Why
not; after all, the pay is stellar and
most of her friends are doing it too!
Her friend Nasser has got the top
score in Physics. Theoretical phys-
ics, particle physics, you name it
– he has been through it. And where
is he going to work? You guessed
it. Nasser studied neutrinoless
double-beta decay and quantum
teleportation, and yet he is sitting
with Jane on the Equities Floor of
Morgan Someguy, cracking out his
seventeenth hour of derivatives
trading.
Investment banking. The mere
name is a synonym for the big green
bucks and your own self-image at
thirty, on your way to the Wharf or
the City in the brand new Maserati
that last month’s bonus easily cov-
ered. Work hard, play hard, they
say; sounds just right for Imperial
students.
But what is this banking world;
more than a cluster of skyscrap-
ers where the financial elite trade
in invisible shares worth more than
anything you have ever, correction,
will ever, own?
To me, it’s an academic black hole.
I don’t know about other places, but
at least 75% of my department’s
graduates migrate to investment
banks. That’s a lot of minds gone
to the wind. It is also the driving
reason behind half of our MEng
students changing to the three year
BEng course. That sounds like kid-
napping to me.
Now, before things are taken the
wrong way, let me say this: invest-
ment banking can be very intellec-
tually challenging. Believe it or not,
some people are born and bred for
these positions - trust me, I know
a few. But is it not puzzling (and
perhaps worrying) that Jane and
Nasser have all this specialised
knowledge under their belts, but
we still find both of them clicking
away stocks from NASDAQ? Where
is our average Joe ‘LSE’ Johnson?

Has he grown bored of the suit-and-
tie and fled to a PhD in neutrinoless
double-beta decay?
I don’t know. All I know is that the
banking world has more perks to
offer than any of its competitors. I
know, I’ve been there. Where else
can you get paid such a ridiculous
- it really deserves a grander ad-
jective - salary. One gags on one’s
tongue when reading the contract.
“Yeah, I don’t think I’ll take it…”
Ka-ching! Dollar signs slot down
over the eyes. “I could just do two
years, then go on vacation…” Be-
fore you know it, you’re sitting in
the toilet cubicle on the fourteenth
floor, absently reaching for the roll
of twenty-pound notes, which have
replaced toilet paper, and count-
ing the seconds lost away from the
trading desk.
Variety is the spice of life. If we all
become bankers, life will be boring,
and everything will be expensive.
Make sure it’s what you really want
to do. Ah, but who are we kidding?
When that phone call arrives, and
the sweet voice of Ms HR whispers
into your ear, I’ll hear that same
old phrase which shatters every
man’s resistance: “You’re paying
me what?!”
China. He bought MySpace™ last
year as part of his digital-age strat-
egy. MySpace™ became one of the
most visited sites on the internet
because of the ease with which peo-
ple could share text, pictures and
video. Mr Murdoch said MySpace™
China was likely to have local part-
ners who would own fifty per cent.
■ The share prices of online gam-
bling firms collapsed after new leg-
islation was passed stopping banks
and credit card companies making
payments to them. This has effec-
tively banned American punters
from using such sites.
■ Sony’s share price fell sharply af-
ter two new companies – Toshiba
and Fujitsu – reported problems
with laptop batteries having the po-
tential to overheat. The issue was
brought to light when an IBM lap-
top caught fire at a Los Angeles
airport. Subsequently, Dell and
Apple recalled the battery model.
■ The days of market rumours
spread on exchange floors are
numbered as market gossip
has found a high-tech forum. A
new automated system will sift
through forty million sources
each day, from blogs to news-
wires. The platform, called Moni-
tor110, is to be run by a former
Deutsche Bank executive who
is selling the software to hedge
funds.
■ Europe’s biggest low-cost air-
line, Ryanair, launched a takeo-
ver bid for Aer Lingus. The Irish
airline made its stock debut last
week, prompting Ryanair to be-
gin the acquisition by purchasing
16 per cent of the shares on offer.
There are two distinctive types of
banking: commercial banking and
investment banking. Commercial
banking involves financial interme-
diation, i.e. the borrowing and lend-
ing of cash between individuals and
smaller companies.
A commercial bank’s role in-
cludes the finding of those seeking
to borrow and to lend, the drawing
up of contracts, and calculating the
probability of the debtor being una-
ble to pay the loan. The greater the
risk that the borrower will default
on the loan, the
higher the inter-
est rate will be.
The banks profit
by charging a
higher rate of in-
terest to borrow
than they pay
out to those de-
positing funds.
Investment
banks do not
have invento-
ries of cash for
the purposes
of lending. Al-
though the
structure var-
ies from bank to
bank, broadly speaking, there are
corporate finance, financial instru-
ment sales and trading and syndi-
cate divisions.
The corporate finance division
is responsible for equity (shares),
debt underwriting and mergers
and acquisitions (M&A). These ac-
tivities involve raising capital for
companies by selling shares in the
company or by selling debt prod-
ucts, and advising on and imple-
menting the joining of or selling-off
of businesses.
The job of a trader is to facilitate
the buying and selling of financial
instruments, e.g. stocks, bonds,
currencies and a vast range of
products. Traders provide ‘liquid-
ity’, allowing traders to buy and sell
on demand, without having to wait
for an individual executing the op-
posite trade. Propriety traders take
positions on behalf of the bank. This
means that they buy and sell in the
hope of benefiting from a rise or fall
in the market directly.
This introduction will have hope-
fully sparked interest and given you
an insight into the banking world.
