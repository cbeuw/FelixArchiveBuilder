Alcohol awareness week
Introduction
Alcohol awareness is the theme of the second welfare
campaign of this year taking place on Thursday and
Friday (7th and 8th December).
The whole aim of the campaign is not to force you
to stop drinking alcohol but to promote an awareness
of how much you are drinking and what effect that
drinking has upon you. Over the two days Riverside
Health Authority will have a display in the JCR which
will have information leaflets available and friendly
personnel to offer advice. On the Thursday evening
there will be a bar quiz held in the Union Snack Bar
with special promotions on selected low alcohol drinks
and free samples of others.
Why do we drink?
Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why you drink
alcohol? You may come up with the answers; to relax,
to feel happy, to forget or to socialise (some of you
would even say simply to get pissed). All of the above
are applicable but cast your minds back to your first
days as a Fresher, did you feel an overwhelming social
pressure to drink? Most people certainly would say
yes. Especially in institutions such as Imperial the
choice of whether to drink or not seems to have
disappeared. But you do have a choice.
Once you've freed yourself from the social
pressures to drink you can then make a choice of
whether to drink or indeed how much to drink. To help
you in yor choice you should consider the following.
How much do we drink?
Awareness of the health hazards of drinking to excess
is quite high (liver disease, heart disease, brain
damage, overweight, etc).
Awareness of the recommended limits is relatively
low (14 units for women 21 units form men per
week).
Awareness of how much we actually -drink is
practically zero.
To help you to help yourself a drink diary has been
produced so that you can easily keep a tab on what
you've been drinking. Try doing this for a week and
you're certain to surprise yourself. Simply cut out the
diary and keep it with you.
