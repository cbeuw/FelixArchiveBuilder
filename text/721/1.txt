College Secretary grabs Union rooms.
Smith Strikes
IC Union will lose control of the
Lounge and the Botany-
Zoology common room if plans
proposed by the College
administration go ahead. On
Monday, ICU Council called
upon President, Carl Burgess to
act immediately to try and
prevent the loss of the rooms.
Mr Burgess has written to
College Secretary, John Smith,
stressing that the proposals do
not have Union approval and
asking that the takeover of the
Union Bar be halted until the
details are agreed by Council.
He has also written to the
Rector, Professor Ash,
explaining the situation in detail
and asking for a meeting to
discuss the matter.
The proposals were revealed
in a letter from Mr Smith which
Mr Burgess received last Friday.
Mr Smith is aiming to convert
the Lounge and the Bot-Zoo
common room into lecture
theatres for the Biology
Department. The Lounge would
still be available as a club
meeting room but not for
parties and discos.
On Monday afternoon Mr
Burgess attended a pre-
arranged meeting with Mr
Smith, College Financial
Secretary, Brian Lloyd-Davies,
and Assistant Secretary,
Michael Arthur. Union Deputy
President, Dave Kingston,
Internal Services Chairman,
Alan Rose, External Affairs
Officer, Grenville Manuel, and
Welfare Officer, Pete Wilson
were also present. The transfer
of Union rooms, as described in
Mr Smith's letter, was
discussed. The Union officers
later expressed their
dissatisfaction over how Mr
Smith had presented the plans.
Mr Burgess told FELIX that the
College Secretary was treating
the proposals in his letter as
matters which had already been
decided. Mr Burgess had
assumed that the letter was a
discussion document only.
Union Council reacted angrily
to news of Mr Smith's scheme
when it met on Monday
evening. A motion proposed by
Academic Affairs officer J
Martin Taylor and ammended
by ex-ICU President Steve
Goulder was passed without
opposition. The motion
instructs the President to make
clear to the College authorities
that any agreement between
Union officers and College
which affects Union
management and/or finances
cannot take effect without the
approval of Council. Mr Burgess
is also instructed to reject any
attempt to impose new
arrangements for the control of
the Union building, and to
request that the plans for the
takeover of the Union bar are
not brought before the
Governing Body until Council
has approved the details.
The Council meeting
lasted for more than
four-and-a-half hours. Mr
Burgess withdrew his original
written report after several
Council members had criticised
it for dealing with trivial matters
rather than the Union's
response to the proposals for
the Union building. He then
reported verbally on his meeting
with Mr Smith. He told Council
that Mr Smith had said that the
changes had already been
agreed upon at a meeting of the
Rector's policy committee.
There had been no formal
consultation with the Union
over the rooms however. SCAB
chairman Nick Shackley
commented that such decisions
made complete nonsense of the
discussion between Mr Smith
and last year's ICU President
Ian Bull. Mr Bull had been given
a verbal agreement that the
Lounge would remain under
Union control, but had not
continued back page...
It's A Fair Cop
Guilds Hit Squad have branched out from armed assasinations into
caped kidnapping. In a daring stunt at midday yesterday, the
masked marauders captured P C Andy Nimmons, the local beat
policeman and held him for ransom. PC Nimmons was taken to
Gerald Road Police Station by Guilds Vice President Symon Corns,
but at this stage the plan backfired. Mr Corns was cautioned by
Superintendant Everson and handcuffed. He was then led around
the station with a collecting pot and forced to accept money by
everyone he saw. The total raised was £16.91. Mr Corns increased
the total to £17.91 by donating £1 himself before he was released.
The money has been donated to Rag.
