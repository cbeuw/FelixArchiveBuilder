The existence of magnetic
monopoles was first
predicted by Paul Dirac, as
long ago as 1931. Since
that time, scientists around
the world have been trying
to experimentally verify the
existence of these
fundamental particles. In
August of this year a team
of physicists, from Imperial
College, detected a
'candidate monopole event'
with their magnetic
monopole detector. This
represents only the second
such event ever recorded.
But, there are other effects
that can mimic the passage
of a monopole through the
detector, so the group are
treating the result with a
great deal of caution; in
fact, because monopoles
are likely to be very rare,
they-feel that it was
probably not a monopole,
but cannot exclude the
possibility.
Around fifty years ago
magnetic monopoles,
which can best be
described as magnetic
'charge' in many ways
analagous to electric
charge, disappeared from
theoretical physics,
because they were
regarded as being
unphysical. Only magnetic
dipoles or higher
configurations have so far
been found to exist in
nature. But grand
unification theories of the
formation of the universe
predict that magnetic
monopoles may have been
formed in the first 10-3 6
seconds after the Big Bang.
If any surviving monopoles
could be found they would
provide direct evidence for
these theories, so there is
now a great deal of interest
in the search for these
particles. Their existence
would also provide the
solution to a problem for
which at present there is no
explanation — that is, why
electric charges come only
in multiples of the charge
on the electron. It was Paul
Dirac, one of the most
intuitive physicists of this
century, who first proposed
that this quantisation of
electric charge could be
understood if a few or even
only one monopole existed
in the universe.
The detection of
magnetic monopoles raises
a number of problems,
because apart from Dirac's
prediction of their
existence very little is
known about them. It is
believed that they were
created by the Big Bang,
that they carry unit charge,
that north and south poles
are equally abundant, and
Now You See It,
Now You Don't
Last week's New Scientist claimed that the Physics
Department of Imperial College, had for the first time,
located a magnetic monopole. However, as Debbie Wilkes
explains, they are not so sure they really wanted to find
one.
that they are more massive
than any other particle,
possibly 10-16 times
heavier than a proton.
However, it is quite
possible that no magnetic
monopoles have survived
the millions of years that
have passed since the Big
Bang is thought to have
happened. But, an upper
limit can be set on the
density of these particles
throughout the universe, it
is because magnetic
monopoles would be
accelerated by galactic
magnetic fields, so drawing
energy from them. But the
persistence and known
lifetime of these fields
allows an upper limit to be
set on their occurence;
which is such that at most
you might expect one
monople a year to pass
through an area the size of
a football pitch. Because
these particles are so rare,
the group at Imperial
College might hope to
detect one monople every
ten thousand years. In fact
their detector was set up as
a negative detector, with
the aim of detecting
nothing over a period of
time, so enabling a more
accurate value to be set on
the upper limit of the
occurence of monopoles.
so, the group are highly
suspicious of the 'candidate
event', which was recorded
only a year after the
detector became
operational, but they have
been unable to pin down
any other explanation.
It was in February 1982
that researchers at Stanford
University recorded a
'candidate monopole event',
only six months after the
start of their experiment.
The experiment had
involved setting up their
equipment to passively
await the arrival of a
cosmic monopole, which
would be able to penetrate
the equipment with no
difficulty. If the theories are
correct, with a small area
detector like the one used
at Stanford, the chances of
observing a monopole in
such a short time are one
in a million. But, as a result
of their observation, there
was intense activity with
new detectors being built
all around the world,
including the one here at
Imperial College. The
design of these new
detectors has been based
on the original used at
Stanford, but they have
been enlarged 100 times,
and improved to minimise
the possibilty of other
effects being mistaken for a
monopole. Because for
three years no other
candidate event was seen,
the scientific community
took the view that the
original Stanford
observation was not a
monopole.
The Imperial College
detector makes use of the
fact that a ring of
superconducting material,
with zero electrical
resistance, is sensitive to
magnetic charge, but
insensitive to ordinary
magnetic dipoles or electric
charge; if a monople
passes throught the ring it
will cause a current to be
induced. The design
eliminates the possibility of
some confusing effects
occuring by using three
such rings, made of
niobium/titanium wire
cooled by liquid helium.
These coils are surrounded
by a superconducting
sheath which greatly
reduces any problems that
result from the natural
variations in the Earth's
magnetic fields. One
difficulty with the design is
that in getting as large an
area as possible, there is
only partial overlap of the
detector coils. This means
that for a positive event,
such as the recent one
where only one coil was
triggered, interpretation
becomes much more
difficult. Mechanical
vibration is an unavoidable
problem which can induce
currents in the detector
coils, but vibration
monitors and other sensors
can be used to combat this
problem.
A more serious problem
results from changes in the
liquid helium level in the
cryostat, but these give rise
to easily recognisable
effects and the data can be
discarded. The only
problem that they can't
account for is magnetic
flux jumps that may occur
in the shield from time to
time. The material that the
shield is constructed from
was chosen because it is
believed to be very stable
in this respect.
After the candidate
monopole event of August,
the group are left not
knowing if what they
observed was a rare
monople, an area flux jump
in the shield, or the result
of some other unknown
effect. In many ways the
group might have been
happier if the event had
never occurred, because it
makes interpretation of
their results much more
complex.
