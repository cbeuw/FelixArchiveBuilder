IC Hockey 1st XI
Yet again the 1st XI has
had a full weeks hockey,
with matches on
| Wednesday, S-^urday and
Sunday.
The Wednesday UAU
I match against LSE ended
| up with a solid 3-0 win with
I goals from Morris, Justin
i and Paul. Although the
| game was unremarkable for
| its hockey, it has ensured
\ that we will be going
I through to the next round
| of UAU.
Saturday's match against
Brunei University in the
I Middlesex League proved a
| much tougher match. IC
| played well as a team
| against a very fit attacking
1 team. However, by half time
| IC were 1-0 up after a fine
| breakaway goal from star
| guest, Nick Hope.
I Unfortunately Brunei
I levelled the score at 1-1 in
| the second half, and
| despite strong pressure
|from IC to take the lead —
ithe game ended drawn.
To end the week. 6
1 players congregated at
Motspur Park for the ULU 6
l a side — reporting various
I degrees of damage due to
Jon Stonham's party,
fortunately he won't be 21
every week! Much to our
I surprise the team proved
too strong(?) for Q E C (2-
0), Goldsmiths (1-0 extra
time), London Hospitals (1-
10). Unfortunately our run
•ended in the semi-final,
I losing to our old rivals and
eventual winners UCL.
,Special mention for Jon
West's brilliant flick saving
during the tournament, '5
.out of 7 ain't bad'
IC 2nds 1 -Royal Arsenal 1
Saturday produced a
disappointing 1-1 draw for
the seconds in their
friendly (???) against Royal
Arsenal.
A brief break in the
! monsoon conditions
afforded us a fairly dry
game despite the onset of
iHurricane Anna in the latter
stages of the match. A
i|perfect start saw the ball
Irattle against the
oppositions backboard in
the first minute. However
IC failed to fulfill this early
promise, perhaps due to
the umpires somewhat
'imaginative' use of the
offside rule or to the
Arsenal goalkeeper's
imposition of a ten yard
exclusion zone any

incursion into which
resulted in immediate
execution.
Unfortunately the
opposition managed to
strike back with a very
dubious goal whilst IC were
distracted by Andy's
excellent Torvill and Dean
impressions.
Some consolation was
gained at the end of the
day with the knowledge
that the Ministry of
Transport are going to
build a motorway through
Royal Arsenal's clubhouse.
The afternoon was
rounded off in traditional
style with another sing-a-
long with Johnson session*.
between two hestitant LSE
defenders and placed the
ball underneath the
advancing keeper. The
second came from a
powerful header from
centre-back Lawrence
Covill from Tom Dutton's
outswinging corner. LSE's
tactic of playing the offside
trap failed leaving Paul
Bravery to round the
keeper and risk permanent
attachment to the goalpost
in poking the ball home to
make the half time score 3-
0.
IC's fourth came when
Tom Dutton beat several
LSE defenders and shot
past the keeper beating him
at the near post. LSE pulled
one back when slack
defensive work allowed an
LSE striker to score from
12 yards.
Dave Lynne held off
several challenges in
freeing Guy Poppy to score
from 12 yards out to make
the score 5-1.
LSE scored a further
consolation goal before
Paul Bravery missed a
golden opportunity to
increase IC's lead by
placing a penalty a yard
wide of the goal after Guy
Poppy had been brought
down in the area.
Football
London Hospital 0 - IC 5ths 2
A superb performance by
IC against a good London
Hospital side was ample
revenge for last year's 10-0
drubbing. In a tight first
half, IC's forwards found
the going hard against our
opponents sweeper system,
but the IC defence gave
nothing away and no
sloppy early goals were
conceded as in previous
games.
In the second half, IC
gradually took control with
Chris, Dave and Stavros
taking a grip on the
midfield. With about twenty
minutes to go, Mark
Woodgate scored from
Nigel Johnson's corner to
put IC in the lead. Nigel,
who'd scored a brilliant
goal in the previous game
against K Q C VI, also took
the corner from which Mark
scored his second goal ten
minutes from time. The
whole side played well and
deserved this victory.
IC 1sts 5 - LSE 2
IC kept alive their hopes of
qualifying for the knockout
section of the national
tournament with another
solid performance against
LSE.
After a shaky start IC
settled down to produce
some excellent flowing
football. The first IC goal
came when Dave Lynne ran
Rugby
IC 1sts 40 - LSE 1sts 0
After the previous week's
charade against Kent,
captain Rob Hargrove
delivered in his inimitable
Irish brogue, a 'Wrath-of-
God' style pre-match talk to
this vital U A U qualifier. IC
rose to the challenge,
scoring 7 exceptional tries,
6 converted by the dis-
believing Neil Folland.
Our 'Wednesday' winger
scored 3 tries, on each
occasion leaving the LSE
defence in his slip-stream.
Scrum-half, Ian Hutchison,
who scored 2 tries, utilised
the blind-side of the scrum
to excellent effect and
acted as a perfect link
between the marauding
forwards and silken backs.
The front five were
dominant in the tight play,
leaving the back-row trio to
excel themselves in the
loose. Flanker, Stephen
Parker, scored 2 fine
running tries, the latter, a
30 yard effort, outstripping
their defence. IC could
have capitalised more in
the final quarter of the
match, but with the score
already at 40-0, and LSE
down and out, there
seemed little point.
