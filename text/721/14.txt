FOR EVERYONE
The 29th London Film
Festival is taking place this

good number of foreign
productions, none of which
one has ever heard of.
However, hidden among all
the culture is the Junior

including 'Sesame Street
Presents: Follow that Bird'
(Sat 4pm). This is
recommended as being
'perfect non-scary
entertainment'. Of major
interest to all the resident
weightlifters should be
'Pumping Iron II: The
Women', (NFT Saturday 11-
15 pm). Programmes
available from the National
Film Theatre, South Bank
