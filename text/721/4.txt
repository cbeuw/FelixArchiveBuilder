Deputy President Dave
Kingston's report to ICU
Council was referred back
to the next meeting
following an objection by
External Affairs Officer
Granville Manuel. Mr
Manuel told council that
the report did not give a
sufffceent aeeouM «* the
work the Deputy Pnwwtent
had bean doing. Mr
Kingston replied that he
wou«J prefer his report to
stand, and felt that it was
the best that he could have
done given the time
available to write it. He
agreed to try to submit
longer reports in the future,
however.
The objection was taken
to a vote and passed with a
clear majority. Another
section of Mr Kingston's
report, which dealt with the
bar takeover, was dicussed
separately after President
Carl Burgess' report had
been concluded. Mr Manuel
also lodged an objection to
this part of the report, but
the meeting voted to accept
it.
ACC Chairman Simon
Errington later commented
that the sabbatical officers'
reports at the last UGM had
also been unacceptably

More
Mergers
The U G C Sub-Committee
for Business and
Management Studies
visited the Departments of
Management Science and
Social and Economic
Studies yesterday. The
chief purpose of the visit
was to discuss Student
numbers, but the possibility
of a merger between the
two departments was also
raised. Professor
Silberston, Head of DSES
said that this department
was fairly keen on a
merger, but that
Management Science was
generally against the idea.
He did not know whether
the committee would be
making any
recommendation to
College.
