Third World First
Anti-Poverty Action passes
into its fourth year at
Imperial and, armed with
uncomfortable facts and a
will to act, a merry band
from Third World First will
descend upon the sleepy
residents of Imperial
College. The object of this
door to door approach is to
bring students face to face
with the problems that exist
in developing countries and
discuss the way in which
the situation should be
challenged. We provided an
opportunity for you to
make a positive
contribution to Third World
Development by donating
to exisiting projects and
informed criticism of the
government policies on aid.
If, by the end of the week,
we have demonstrated to
some students that the true
causes of poverty lie
beyond 'acts of God' in the
realms of international
politics and trade, our
mission will be
acomplished. The action
begins on Monday and we
plan to cover Southside,
Linstead, Weekes, Garden
and Beit Halls; Hamlet and
Evelyn Gardens by the end
of the week. Looking
forward to seeing you.
Orienteering
The Orienteering Club
invites all interested to a
party-cum-talk about
Navigation, Elementry
Techniques, BOF,
Equipment and much more.
Slides! Free Peanuts! SCR
Union Building. 7.30pm
Monday 18 Nov.
STOIC
Christmas is not far around
the corner now. Shops
have already, as usual
decorated their windows
with traditional ornaments.
Father Christmas is
hurriedly buying and
packing the last of his gifts.
As if you aren't already sick
of Christmas, you may be
asking what STOIC
(Student Television of
Imperial College) is doing.
Well, we have an exciting
all night show lined up for
the last week-end of term.
Just think! Two feature
films, numerous pop
videos, hopefully several
episodes of the Young
Ones and many more
sketches and special
interest programmes.
If any person or groups
or societies are interested
in creating and acting out a
sketch, we are willing to
help record it and
broadcast it during our
night-long bonanza. Just
come and see us about it in
the TV Studio along the
walkway or in the STOIC
Union Room.
QTSoc
This week sees QT branch
out and support many
minority groups within IC.
Specialist meetings have
been organised, for further
details see the small-ads.
One of the new groups is
ODDSOC, which will meet
in the JCR every Friday
between 12.30 and 1.30.
Members will sit quietly
wearing odd socks, waiting
to be challenged with the
phrase: 'I believe you are
one of them—I claim my
prize'. A correct challenger
will receive an ODDSOC
membership card and is
then entitled to sit in the
JCR on Friday lunchtimes
wearing odd socks. This
will continue until
ODDSOC is the largest
club at IC. If wrongly
challenged (out of hours,
not in the JCR,etc)
members have been told to
deny all knowledge of the
organisation. You have
been warned!
In an effort to preserve
law and order and dryness
at IC, QT have formed a
vigilante patrol to
apprehend the Phantom
Soaker. If you are stopped
by the patrol then please
co-operate as they search
you for hidden weapons,
buckets, etc. This is for
your own safety and
protection—this man must
be soaked as soon as
possible. Suspects are
advised to surrender upon
contact with the patrol, to
avoid unnecessary
dampness. Our policy is to
squirt on sight!
Islamic Society
'In the name of Allah the
most gracious, the most
merciful'
The aim of IS is to promote
the essence of Islam and to
clean up some of the
serious and false
misconceptions about
Islam prsent now in the
western media.
Islam is not only a
religion, Islam is a
complete way of life. Islam,
unlike all other religions,
has two main books.
1 The Qur'an which is the
word of Allah (God) as
revealed by the Angel
Gabriel to the Prophet
Mohammad.
2 The Hadith which is a
record of the sayings and
actions of the Prophet
Mohammad.
Islam does not claim to be
a 'new' religion or kind of
faith. The word Islam in
arabic means submission
and resignation and it it is
derived from a word
meaning peace.
The Qur'an is the basic
source of the Muslim's faith
and practice. The first few
verses revealed from the
Qur'an to the prophet
Mohammad were:
1 Proclaim! (or read), in the
name of thy Lord and
Cherisher, who created.
2 Created man, out of a
hanging drop!
3 Read! And thy Lord is
most bountiful.
'-He who taught (the use
of) the pen.
5 Taught man that which
he knew not.
In these five, first
revealed, verses of the
Qur'an the main subject is
to learn and search for
knowledge for the sake of
Allah (God). Also, from the
prophet's sayings: he said
'seek knowledge from the
cradle to the grave'.
I would like to ask where
does this stand in
comparison to what Islam
is being accused of these
days?
This is a brief
introduction to the
misunderstood Islam, this
misunderstanding resulting
from the extreme attitude
of the west.
Jewish Society
The Jewish Society, though
absent at Freshers Fair this
year, is alive and well, and
has arranged a number of
events this term. We hope
that Friday night meals will
be a regular feature this
year, as always. They are
notable for their informal
atmophere and the
copiously flowing Israeli
wine.
This week (Thursday, 21
November at 1.15pm in the
Union SCR) we'll be having
a speaker meeting at which
Rabbi Danny Kirsch will be
the invited guest. He is a
very entertaining speaker
and his subject will be 'The
Marlborough Man,
Merchandizing and
me'—Confused? Come
along and find out what on
earth he's talking about.
Another major event
coming up is the Soviet
Jewry Vigil outside the
Soviet Embassy on the 19
and 20 of Novmember—to
coincide with the tenth
anniversary of the Helsinki
Agreement on Human
Rights. It will be a 48 hour
vigil during which we'll
probably do some active
learning of the Torech,
etc—in order to
demonstrate to the public
what we, in the West,
consider a basic human
right, yet which is
forbidden to Jews in the
Soviet Union. If you can
spare an hour of your time
on these two days, please
contact Josie Glausuisz,
Life Science 3 for more
details and for any other
information about the
Jewish Society.
SF Soc
'So you are looking for the
SF Soc article!' The old
mans eyes bored into my
skull, sharp as diamonds.
'Y-y-yes'. I stuttered,
unnerved by his intense
gaze. I closed the wooden
door to his dilapidated
shack and stepped gingerly
into the hovel.
'Well don't just stand there.
Sit down!' He commanded.
I looked around. There
was no other chair but the
one on which the man was
seated.
'Urn..' I began.
'sit!'
I sat.
'So you wish to learn
about the article'. I nodded
he cackled gleefully,
rubbing his hands together
until sparks flew from his
knuckles.
Tell me.' he said, 'What
do you expect the article to
look like?'
'Well, I..I,' I lapsed into
silence, stunned by the full
enormity of the quesition.
What did an article look
like? How many legs did it
have? More to the point
what sort of teeth did it
have? I grew nervous and
clutched my sword.
He rose and stood before
me, arms stretched wide,
beard shining, eyes
flickering.
With a voice that shook
all space time he spoke.
'Look around you,' he
gestured at the hut This is
the article. Within this room
is all the information you
need. The facts are plain.
SF Soc meets in the Green
Committee room on a
Thursday lunchtime, SF
Soc have a library of well
over 1000 titles. All you
seek is here!'
Fear overcame me. I
turned and ran
blindly..straight into the
door.
Zarquon!! I thought as I
slid to the floor. Then
blackness overcame me.
10 Friday 15 November FELIX
