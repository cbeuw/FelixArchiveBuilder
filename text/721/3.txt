Pinko Pete Again
Sir,
Re-Picket of Sir Keith
Joseph:
John Ranson (FELIX no
720) has not approached
Socialist Society with any
of his complaints, or to
enquire about the motives
for the picket, apparently
content to whinge
unhindered by the facts.
Destructive? At the
picket, I actively
encouraged pickets to go
and hear Sir Keith, and ex-
pickets made up a
substantial fraction of his
audience. Subversive?
What a load of shit. Our
entry in 'What's On'
specifically appealed for
peaceful protest, and at all
times I endeavoured to co-
operate both with Consoc
and College Security.
With regard to our
publicity, it is possible that,
due entirely to my own
oversight, a few posters
were made which did not
carry the Society stamp.
This was a matter of
genuine error rather than
any intention to deceive,
and one for which I
apologise to anybody who
was concerned. The
overwhelming majority of
the posters did carry the
stamp (indeed, I have yet to
be shown one which does
not). The diminutive size of
the Society's name was
intended not to discourage
non-socialists from
picketing. I do not believe
that the picket was a party
political event: no student
should condone attacts
upon education, whatever
her/his politics.
As for What's On: Mr
Ranson must surely be
aware that anybody is
entitled to place a What's
On entry. The name of the
organiser is required for
the form: it was omittted
from the text for the above
reason.
I shall of course be
happy to demolish any
further claptrap Mr Ransom
has to spout.
Yours rabidly,
Peter Hobbis

Dear Hugh,
I feel that I must apologise
for the crude sexist crap
that passed itself off as last
weeks' QT article. In an
effort to be different I
delegated the task to an
innocent looking fresher.
Unfortunately he turned out
to be a miner, and his
submission reflected this to
a great extent.
To ensure that this never
occurs again and that QT
articles continue to be of
the highest quality, it has
been decided to hold-tajs,
'Write for QT' CompetiUpn.
Successful entries wifl P
probably be humorous,
totally irrelevant and
written on the back of a £5
note. Submissions please
to QT Soc c/o IC Union
Office. QT Members and*
their immediate families are
incredibly likely to win.
Once again I do most
humbly apologise for
offending people last week.
Yours,
Adam Jefferson
(QT Chairman)
