Well hi there sleaze lovers,
things are a bit lightweight
this week due to one or two
urgent appointments.
However to make up for
this, we have a really
heavyweight story. One of
the best known figures
around FELIX, and in fact
College generally, is that of
Nigel 'Paparrazzi' Atkinson.
However the famous big
Nige profile is now on the
change. The king of the
clicking shutters has
recently been seen at IC
Keep Fit. On hearing about
this Alan 'Sooty' Rose put
out a top level command to
film our Nige working out.
Alas our friends have failed
in their bid for a revealing
scoop. What depths these
media people stoop to.
STOIC also organised a
debate between FELIX
editor, Hugh Southey and
ICU President, Carl
Burgess. They hoped a
slanging match between
the two would do wonders
for their ratings (which
make Channel 4 look
popular). Unfortunately _
Hugh and Carl arranged
things before the interview
with the result they
appeared as the best of
friends united against the
common enemy over in
Sherfield. Bad luck Al, just
when you had every
gimmick in the book lined
up.
More balls-ups this time
on behalf of Guilds
mascotry. The idea of
mascotry is of course to
steal things, but our

his Keep Fit lessons. Sorry
about the quality of the
photos, Nige wasn't keen to
be photographed.
bungling friends have not
managed this in several
years. Their latest attempt
was thwarted by a single
gate keeper. Our intrepid
band managed easily to
whisk the mascot of Barts
Medical School out of its
resting place in the bar.
This they accomplished by
means of an aerial
ropeway. However, on
making a quick getaway in
their van they found
themselves prisoners in a
locked Barts quad. The
whole event, though, ended
in the best of spirits with
Barts opening the bar for a
conciliatory drink. After
affable negotiations it was
agreed Guilds would put
the mascot back and Barts
and Guilds would each
donate 20 pints of blood.
Anyone wishing to give
blood should contact
Guilds. Nice try, better luck
next time lads.
