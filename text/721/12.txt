Four Heads
'Imperial College excelled
in taking two divisions'
Daily Telegraph 11.11.85.
In the Head of the River
Fours sponsored by Fullers,
imperial was represented
by seven crews. The crews
had a wide range of
starting positions and were
spread from starting 8th to
321st amongst the 432
crews starting the race.
The Senior A coxless
four which started eighth
was racing amongst good
company. The Thames
Tradesmen E4— and
Oxfords E4+ crews started
very close behind them. By
the end of the 3 mile
course the IC Crew had
opened up a small margin
over both these crews and
things seemed good for a
possible win. This would
only be confirmed once the
Senior A4— new entries
had finished and result
estimates could be made.
The other Senior A
Coxless four starting 50th
had a disappointing race
probably rating too low to
achieve a good result. The
next IC crew was the
Senior A coxed four and by
the time they had reached
the finishing straight they
had passed several crews
and looked to be going well
as they picked up for the
finish. The next two crews
the 'Black Adder' Senior B
and Senior A coxless fours,
both put together a week
before the race had spirited
rows. The Women's four
had a solid row but racing
amongst mens crews had
no-one in their division
around them.
The Senior B coxed four
was another of the
favoured IC crews to do
well. They overtook a large
number of crews as they
worked their way down the
course 'donkey fashion'.
The results which came
out seven hours after the
start time of the race
revealed two wins for
Imperial. IC came within a
second of winning 3
divisions as the Senior B
coxed four came second in
that division to a Leander
crew.
The Senior A4— finishing
17th won their division by a
second and finished as the
5th fastest coxless four.
The Senior A4+ finishing
21st won their division and
were the third fastest coxed
fours and beating the
coxed foars from UL and
Oxford gave added
satisfaction.

IC stretched their unbeaten
run to three matches, and
assured themselves a place
in the national UAU
knockout. Notable
performances from M Cox
and D Tierney led IC to
what can only be termed a
'thrashing of LSE'. Cox now
unbeaten for two years in
UAU matches crushed his
American opponent in
typical style. D Tierney in
his 1st year has won all his
matches by very large
margins. Rumours are that
he may well be promoted
to no 2 in the team in place
of Dave Lang, who
although deceptively long
off the tee, did well to half
his match. John Gamblin
had a return to form with a
good win. Dave Jakubovic,
the 'powerful postgrad', had
no opposition at all. His
awesome reputation has
swept through University
golfing circles and he is a
real force for IC at the
bottom end of the team.
Next week IC face their
toughest challenge against
Surrey—the winner winning
the division so good luck
lads.

Last weekend saw the
intrepid IC team set off on
another season of hard-
fought, cut and thrust
battle. Cambridge had
acceptec pur1
challenge to
fight it but 0? home waters,
(how couid we possibly
lose?)
The arrival of grey skies
and windy weather was not
particularly conclusive to
the summing up of a gres,.
deal of enthusiasm.
Nevertheless, after a great
deal of deliberation, the
decision was made to
'scramble' every man (or
woman) to their boats.
The recently appointed
Vice-Captain B:<me!ow was
eager to demonstrate that
he was truly,worthy of such
a position. He was first to
rig his boat-very
impressive-unfortunately
that's where it ended. His
next trick was to capsize
his boat whilst still tied to
the jetty, losing his poppy
and two rudders in the
process. As if that wasn't
enough to prove that he
really was human after all,
he decided to head-butt the
boom and spray the boat

succeeded in proving them
wrong, as we showed how

All credit must be given
to the Cambridge team for
mastering our
unpredictable boats in very
trying conditions. They

their true mastery of ths
