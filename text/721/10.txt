Indsoc
I hope everyone has read
the Indsoc Annual
Magazine by now.
If you would like to help
with next year's magazine
or if you're just interested
in what we do then come
along to one of our
committee meetings,
always held on Friday at
12.30pm, usually in Chem
Eng LT 4.
Last week started with an
ICI Speaker and quite a
technical talk about
composites and their users.
Then on Wednesday we ran
two visits, a dozen of us
were shown around the
control tower at Heathrow,
shown a film about Air
Traffic control and given a
talk about how it is used at
Heathrow. This visit was
very over subscribed so
we're going back next term.
And what has the
future got to offer? BBC
Research are speaking next
Tuesday lunchtime. Five
hours later we have British
Steel visiting College, they
always give us a very good
evening presentation.
Thursday lunchtime sees
our second speaker
meeting of the week, Marks
and Spencers Buying
department.
Well there's 11 events in
three weeks, so what more
can you ask for? Well in
addition to our pubished
list of events the C E G B are
talking about alternative
energy in the future on 28
November and next term
extra visits will include
Rolls Royce Cars, Lotus
Cars and Rolls Royce Aero
Engines, plus four more
business games. Shell,
Touche Ross, Tube
Investment and Peat
Marwick and twenty other
events. We'll keep you
posted.

If you feel your vocation in
life is wandering around
making strange noises and
recording them; or
brandishing hammers and
paintbrushes with malicious
intent then you might like
to go to the Sound and
Stage Workshop on
Wednesday. Here you can
find out about making sets
look convincing, and
without too much effort.
Also there is the art of
making sound tapes and
how to create sound effects
on stage.
It takes place on
Wednesday at 2.30pm Meet
in the Storeroom (Level 21
/2
Union East Staircase.)
1,000,001 Darts
To round off rag week, and
make sure you really don't
jet up for Monday lectures,
why not come and play in
this 60-hour rag darts
match? The teams are
usually exclusively RCS,
but this year I would like to
make it R C S vs rest of the
world—to show you lot
when it comes to really
pointless events, we RCS
are the best!
What is really needed is
the commitment to play for
a specific 4 or 8 hour
period, especially over
Saturday and Sunday
nights, and particularly in
pairs, or groups of 4. So
get a few friends together,
and send me a note (Paul
Bloomfield, Maths 3—or
RCS Office) giving your
name, department, and
times you are willing to
play. Incidently, individual
scores are recorded, and as
well as a printed record of
your performance, there
will be a prize for the
highest score achieved (last
year over 100,000!). If you
can't be bothered to play
(Why not?), at least pay a
few 10p's for guesses at the
total number of darts
thrown by the winning
team—£10 to the closest
guesser. There are sponsor
forms at IC Union.
The darts match starts at |
6pm, next Friday in
Southside Lpwer lounge,
and should finisharound
7am Monday.
2hess Club
This Saturday IC 1st team
managed to win the rather
unfortunately named, Pugh
Cup. Imperial fielded 2
teams against teams from
all the other colleges in
London.
The 1st team got off to a
disasterous start scoring
only 21
/2 points out of 6 in
the 1st round after a
bottom board collapse, two
of the players complaining
of bad hangovers from the
night before. In the 2nd
round though, they played
a blinder and won 6 games
out of 6, giving them 81
/2
points out of 12, just
pipping Q M C by1
/2 a point.
The second team,
comprising mainly of
players making their debut
for IC also finished in a
creditable position against
good opposition.
Especially good
performances were made
by Horrocks, Windle and
Chineqwundoh in the 1st
team, and Shewan in the
2nds.
