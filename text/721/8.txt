Billed as Francis King's 'most
masterful, comic and moving
novel', Voices in an Empty
Room merely bored me. The
characters wince through a
tedious plot, with few subtle
shifts, moving from one
predictable event to another. I
was left wondering if King
was a misanthropist;
otherwise what could he hope
to gain from portraying every
single person as sweaty,
bitchy, bullying, bombastic,
nosey or just plain
unpleasant? If I were a ghost
I don't think I'd ever want to
see any of those people
again, much less move
glasses about or knock on
walls for them.
The central women in the
story, searching for signals
from the other world, were
either wrapped up in their
own pride, as Sybil and
Lavinia were, or very week
and pliable victims of life,
such as Audrey and Bridgit. A
whole variety of spiritualist
con-men are displayed, the
twist (if it can be described
so) being that after the last
meeting one of the women, in
her joy/grief, destroys the
evidence of a spiritualist
encounter.
The dangers of meddling
with the spirit world are
touched upon. Apart from the
con-men who discreetly
milked their victims, those
participating tended to turn
inwards upon their grief,
becoming even more self-
centred than human beings
usually are.
At £2.50 this is a total rip-
off. There are far cheaper
ways to fall asleep.
John Boorman's noble aim in
The Emerald Forest'
(Leicester Square Theatre),
drawing attention to the
destruction of the rain forest
and it's people, is sometimes
lost in mythological
ramblings and concessions to
populist cinema, but is
nevertheless a very brave
attempt to tackle a difficult
subject.
Part of the difficulty is
trying to convey the concept
that there are people who
'still know what we have
forgotten' to a cynical cinema
audience (not to mention
critics), and as a result the
naive utterances of the
tribesmen often come closer
to being amusing than to the
innocent profundity intended.
The editing also fails to allow
the audience to become as
involved and concerned as it
ought to, by frequently
cutting short the scenes
before fully developing the
message in them.
The boy shows equal
fascination in his civil
engineering father's dam-
building activities as he does
in the activities of the
industrious ants in the forest,
and it is whilst following
these ants that he stumbles
across the leader of the
Invisible People, who takes
pity on the child and rescues
.him from the Dead World (the
deforested world of the
whitemen, who are known as
the Termite People because
of their destructive habits).
During the ten years that the
boy, Charley Boorman,
becomes a man in the tribe,
his father, Poers Boothe,
spends every spare moment
searching for him. Their
Woman who, married Clark
Gable' which is showing with
'Letter to Brehzenvnev',
reviewed below. It is a
delightful story set in 30s
Dublin telling how when
George, Bob Hoskins
wonderful as ever, grows a
moustache and, by
coincidence, goes to see 'San
meeting heralds the
beginning of the slow change
of emphasis from an
ethnographical observation of
the Invisible People to a
Saturday afternoon jungle
story in which the good
Indians and good white men
beat the bad Indians and bad
whites.
The portrayal of the Indians
is sympathetic and never
patronising and the Chief in
particular is a marvellous
character. Their animistic
beliefs and tribal powers are
conveyed with skill and
conviction, and the emphasis
on their characters contrast
well with the faceless
bulldozer drivers. But even
so, the film fails to provoke
enough response to the final
information that of the 4
million 'Indians that once
inhabited' the rain forest only
120000 remain, resulting in an
entertaining but unmoving
story.
In the same period that it
can take to find a son, the
last ten years have shown a
decline, almost to the point of
extinction, of the short film. I
am therefore happy to be
able to report if not a revival
of the genre, then at least one
good example of it, 'The
Francisco', his wife becomes
obsessed with the similarity
between George and Blackie,
the character played by Clark
Gable. This excites her desire
for both George and his
conversion to Catholicism,
but subsequently leads to
problems when she is unable
to distinguish between reality
and fantasy when she reads
about the infidelities of her
screen idol. It is wonderfully
shot in black and white and is
a nice change from the
adverts before the main film,
even though it's presence
doesn't liberate us from the
ubiquitous Pernod adverts.
Having made it through the
adverts the audience is
rewarded with the charming
'Letter to Brehznev', a film in
the same vein as 'Gregory's
Girl' though a good deal
earthier.
Two Liverpool 'scallites' are
determined to have a good
night out to escape their
mundane week, being
unemployed in the case of
Elaine, or chicken stuffing, in
the case of Teresa. The
resourceful Teresa, Margi
Clarke (Sister of the writer,
Frank), steals a wallet from a
drunken lecher and the two
girls escape into a night club,
where they meet two Russian
sailors. With the money they
have stolen they spend a
night in a hotel, where Teresa
gets her night of passion and
Elaine , Alexandra Pigg,
discovers romance and is
then determined to follow her
man to Russia. This desire
then reveals all the anti-
communist propaganda of
films like 'Rambo'.
Peter Firth plays the
romantic Russian delightfully,
whilst his comrade, Alfred
Molina, whose knowledge of
English consisted of 'Beatles'
and 'Liverpool', adds a new
word to his vocabulary, and a
whole new meaning to that
word, chicken.
The script is full of great
one-liners, so much so that I
gave up trying to take notes
after about a minute, but the
direction is not quite so good,
there are several moments
where the film becomes very
sentimental, slow motion
dancing and surging romantic
music, and twinkling stars,
and I cringed a bit, but what
the hell, it's a lot of fun and I
even snivelled a bit at the
ending.

S
Chronicle of the Black Sword
is the new albunrvby ex-
seventies psychedelic loonies
Hawkwind, and coincides
with a major new tour. Any
attempt to catalogue the
band's changes of personnel
and style would run into
volumes, suffice to say that
ex-Hawkwind players number
over 40 including Lemmy and
Ginger Baker. For the new
album the current line-up,
including new bassist Alan
Davey, have returned to their
connections with SF author
- vfc
Michael Moorcock. The
album is based upon
Moorcocks 'Elric' books and
is perhaps an attempt to
extend the earlier 'Warrior on
the Edge of Time' concept
with which Moorcock also
collaborated. Indeed in the
fade of the track 'Sleep of a
Thousand Tears' there are
definite echoes of 'Kings of
Speed'.
The Hawks last couple of
albums have been
disappointing and have
prompted the release of much
semi-bootleg material which
is little better than rubbish.
However, Alan Davey appears
to have injected the band
with a new power source. The
lyrics, I must admit, are not
epic, but the overall sound of
the album grows on you with
listening. Fairly classic
Hawkwind riffs alternate with
synth-based tracks which
have a definite hint of
Tangerine Dream. But at the
same time the whole lot is
liberally injected with effects
and theatrics which make the
Wind stand out from most
contemporary heavy rock
groups.
Hawkwind became
legendary with their wild and
spectacular stage shows,
notably the 'Space Ritual',
and despite their ups and
downs in the record business
have maintained a strong live
reputation. It will be
interesting to see what an
older but more mature band
pull out of the hat when they
visit Hammersmith Odeon in
December. A must for those
who like good, fun, SF based
nonsense. In the mean time I
think I'll load up my needle
gun and go for a quick spin
in my silver machine...
