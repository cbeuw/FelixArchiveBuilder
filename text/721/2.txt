Union Lounge
The Department of Pure
and Applied Biology first
I expressed an interest in
taking over the Lounge at
the end of last year They
claimed that they had
insufficient laboratory
space. At that time Ian Bull,
who was then President,
objected strongly because,
in his view, the Lounge was
needed as it was the best
area for parties and bands.
At the time, Ian attempted
to get College to agree that
the whole of the north side
of Beit should come under
Union control. College
agreed verbally that this
was a good idea.
Unfortunately, they failed
to agree to this in writing.
Now College have decided
that they can make money
by moving part of the
Biology department from
Silwood to South
• Kensington. As a result
they need the Lounge to
make extra space for the
department by converting
the Lounge into lecture
theatres so that other
lecture theatres can be
converted into labs. All the
promises about keeping the
Union free for the Union
have been forgotten.
Ian Bull was right when
he said that the Lounge
was the only room suitable
for parties. It is the only
room that is the right size
and decor for parties (ie
isn't like the J C R which
reminds one of an airport
departure lounge) which
isn't near enough to
residents to attract
complaints about noise (the
New Year Party attracted
complaints from residents
who could hear the concert
hall). College don't need
the number of lecture
theatres they have at
present. The U G C have
reported that the College
has too many lecture
theatres. College should
remember that students
need a social life.
Unfortunately, College
seem to have link the
takeover of the Union Bar
to the Lounge. They seem
to think that we should
swap the lounge for the
Bar. Without the Lounge
we risk losing a large
amount of money on the
Bar. Many of the events
that make the most money
for the Bar are the parties
that we can't hold without »
the Lounge.
The policy that Union
Council adopted on
Monday attempts to treat
the Bar and the Lounge as
seperate issues. The Bar
and the Lounge are
seperate issues. The Union
needs the Lounge. It has
had control of the Lounge.
To have it taken could ruin
much fo the good work
done by Ents. The Union
should have control of the
Bar. The Union Bar is a
student bar and as such it
should be run by students
for students.
Sixth formers are
becoming choosy about
where to go to college. The
Rector is particularly
worried about how the
quality of applicants is
dropping. One factor that
sixth formers are starting to
look at is the quality of the
social life. Isn't it possible
that conversion of the
Lounge into a lecture
theatre and subsequent
worsening of the social life
will reduce the quality of
applicants to IC further.
Hopefully, the new Rector,
Prof Ash, will realise that
his administrators are
making a mistake when
they advise him to support
Biology's takeover of the
Lounge
STOIC
In this issue there are
several references to an all
night programme to
broadcast on STOIC.
Unfortunately, this will no
longer take place. The
Electrical Engineering
Department have refused to
allow them to broadcast it.
This programme had the
support of the TV studio
needed. A bureaucrat who
needed to do nothing more
than sign a piece of paper
ruined STOIC'S chance to
improve their image.
Last Week
Last week's FELIX certainly
seemed to have stirred
people up. Firstly an
appology, I accept that
Dave Kingston did not lose
the hall bills as stated in
Below the Belt. I
appologise for any damage
this has done. Secondly I'd
like to point out that the
person shown being
arrested on page 4 did not
gate crash the party. Finally
I'd like to say that Carl
Burgess and Dave Kingston
both say that Carl was not
pissed when he meet John
Smith last week. The three
senior officers who claimed
he was pissed still say he
was. I leave it to you to
decide.
Photo Competition
FELIX and Photosoc are
running a photographic
competition. Please submit
portfolios of prints to the
FELIX office by the end of
term. The winning entries
will be printed in FELIX.

Kingston Defended
Dear Sir,
I fully realise that 'Below
the Belt' is meant as a
light-hearted article to be
taken with a large pinch of
salt but when, as in last
Friday's edition, an item is
totally inaccurate and if not
refuted could be potentially
damaging, then the record
must be set straight.
The truth is that Dave
Kingston could never have
'lost' the sabbatical
residence bills as they have
been in my possession ever
since arriving in*he Union
Office. In fact, Dave took
great care when checking
the bills and found certain
revisions were required
before he was prepared to
authorise payment. All
parties concerned were
aware of the situation, had
it well in hand and at no
time whatsover was the
Union in danger of being
liable for the £15 late
payment charge.
I have no idea who
Ratfink is but I should be
grateful if you would
ensure that, in future,
he/she/they check stories
more thoroughly. Once
erroneous information gets
into print, the damage has
been done.
Sincerely,
Jen
Union Administrator
Holy Pork Meat,
Batman
Dear Sir,
I wish to make a strong
protest about seriously
misleading information
which appeared on the
Southside menu on Oct
31st. On entering the
refectory that evening I
noticed a dish featuring Bat
meat. Believing this to be a
local delicacy I decided to
try some. Only after eating
several mouthfuls did I
discover that I was in fact
eating Pork. My religious
beliefs now compell me to
beat my head against a wall
ten times each day before
breakfast, for a period of
one lunar month, in
penance of this act. This is
not a good thing I can tell
you!
Yours devoutly
Carl Mottke
Perverse Pose
Dear Hugh,
With reference to the letter
from Oliver Smart in last
weeks FELIX. Mr Smart will
be pleased to know that the
picture on the poster in
question does not in fact
show a man being
suspended from his wrists
(which apparently leads to
death after an hour due to
asphixiation), but a man on
a rack, which I am assured
is much less painfull.
As to the source of the
picture, I was unable to
persuade members of the
Guilds exec to pose, so I
resorted to copying it from
an infamous source of
pervertion and torture. An
advert for an investment
trust on the financial pages
of the Daily Telegraph.
Yours
Richard Davis
