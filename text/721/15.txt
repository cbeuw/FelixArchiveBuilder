Guilds in van heist
A lone member of Guilds hit squad got Rag Week off to an
early start on Tuesday by hijacking a contractor's van
outside Mech Eng. The firm of service engineers agreed a
£10 ransom to release their van from the Motor Club
ramps. The identity of the hijacker is unknown but it is
rumoured the raid was organised by a sinister mastermind
in Mech Eng Security.
Presidents
protest
Presidents of all the
London college unions
took the opportunity to
express their concern over
education cuts at the
University of London
Foundation Day on
Wednesday. They are
dissatisfied with the
disruption caused by recent
college mergers and their
negative effects on
education. The University,
they say, has shown 'a lack
of consideration' for the
students affected. As a sign
of protest the union
representatives dressed in
black and refused
refreshments.
Tony Millns, Publicity
Officer for the University of
London, commented 'It is
sad that the students don't
understand that the
restructuring is in the
interest of future students.
He added that the
University is 'under
pressure to achieve
rationalisation' from the
government, and that
restructuring will ensure
the best use of resources.
During the ceremony
Princess Anne, Chancellor
of the University of London
presented nine honorary
degrees. Among the
recipients were Sir John
Sainsbury, Chairman of
Sainsbury's and director of
the Royal Opera House, the
painter Mr Howard
Hodgkin, and Miss Iris
Murdock, novelist and
winner of the Whitbread
and Booker Prize.
Cute cabaret
A lunchtime cabaret
featuring the London
comedians John Hegley
and Otis Canelloni was
staged by QT Soc on
Tuesday. The act featured
alternative humour, bizzare
stunts with paper bags, and
a good deal of audience
participation. Comments
from the onlookers ranged
from 'interesting' to 'weird'
and 'amazing'.
Smith strikes
...from front page
received any written
confirmation of this. Mr
Shackley added that Mr
Smith saw the transfer of
rooms and the takeover of
the Union bar as a single
issue, whereas the Union's
view had been that the two
matters were unconnected.
Guilds President Roger
Preece criticised Mr
Burgess for not calling a
meeting of the Union
Executive upon receipt of
Mr Smith's letter. Publicity
officer Adrian Johnson was
concerned that Mr Burgess
had not registered any
complaint over the timing
of the letter. Mr Burgess
was also criticised severely
for his handling of the
negotiations to take over
the Union Bar. He was
asked why he had allowed
Mr Smith's draft paper to
be presented unchanged
at House Committee,
instead of implementing the
changes recommended by
the Union Planning Group.
Mr Burgess replied that he
considered the revised
paper far too woolly and
did not think that House
Committee would have
passed it. This explaination
was rejected by Council.

Cooking
the books
Several Union officers
expressed concern about
the finances of the
Bookshop at Council on
Monday. They were worried
about the levels of stock
kept by the Bookshop and
by the size of the
Bookshop's overdraft.
Deputy President, Dave
Kingston, told FELIX that
he wouldn't comment until
he had had time to discuss
the situation with the
bookshop manager.
3-day Don
Student Services Officer
Don Ferguson is working a
three-day week. From the
start of term Mr Ferguson
has been spending
Tuesdays and Thursdays
studying for an MSc degree
in the Department of
Computing.
Finance assistant, and
former ICU Deputy
President, Dave Parry said
that the absence of Mr
Ferguson from the office
two days per week did not
affect the running of
Student Services. FELIX
attempted to contact Mr
Ferguson on Wednesday,
but were told that he was
out of the office for the
day.
Sex rules
Deputy President, Dave
Kingston intends to
propose changes in the
disciplinary rules at the
next Council that will make
sexual harassment an
offence. This follows an
incident at the Civil
Engineering Freshers'
dinner when a woman had
her dress ripped. If the
policy is adopted it will
mean students guilty of
sexual harassment could be
fined or banned from the
Union building.
Balls
A set of 6 coloured snooker
balls was stolen from the
Union snooker room on
Wednesday night.
Following a spate of such
thefts last year, the snooker
club cannot afford to
replace them.
The club wants the balls
returned, and will ask no
questions.
Shaving foam and vomit flowed at the RCS Beer Festival
on Wednesday. Guilds Hit Squad and IC Exhibition Ale
were much in evidence at the event, which opened this
year's Rag Week.
Over £3800 was taken and all the profits will go to
charity. ICU Deputy President Dave Kingston said he
thought these were record takings for the event.
