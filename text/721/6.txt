The
1985
Guilds
Carnival
'puts a smile into students'
It's Friday the 22nd, one week from
today. Lectures have finished for the
week. You can go home. It's bath time
tonight, and let's face it, this could be
your first bath of the week. Out comes
your hairdryer, a clean shirt, your.-
strongest deodorant, a new bottle of
aftershave perhaps, or a little make-up.
or both? You're looking good, you tell
yourself. Your reflection leers back at
you unconvincingly, butthen that
always was a crappy mirror. Now
you're on your way/back to college.
You're getting excited. And why?
Because tonight's the Guilds Carnival
of course—a fun filled night of song
and dance is ahead of you. Bands,
films, poetry, jazz, discos, food, drink
and cocktails await to delight your
senses. No wonder you're
excited—who wouldn't be with all that
too look forward to?
Well, let me take this opportunity to
have a good moan, because I shall
certainly not be excited, nor shall I be
looking forward to the night ahead: A
fun filled night of watching the front
door, getting the bands to go on stage
on time (which they never do, in case
you hadn't noticed; 'just another ten
minutes', they say as they sit having a
nice chat to each other, scoffing all the
food and drink which they insist you
provide 'as refeshments'), moving the
PA out, setting up the films, doing the
discos, and, my special favourite,
clearing up afterwards. Sounds like a
lot of fun eh?.
Probably the one remotely enjoyable
thing I shall do all night is to make you
lot suffer the indiginity of having your
hand stamped with a horrible inky
blotch to show that you've paid. You
may feel that sometimes we hit you
rather unnecessarily viciously with our
rubber stamp, but do please try to
show a little understanding. You see,
for people like me, Carnival started a
long time ago, phoning up the agents
to see what bands they had available.
Have you rung up an agent? No? Well
take my word for it, you'd just love it.
Then comes the real fun, as if chatting
to all those lovely, lovely agents wasn't
enough" you embark on 8 desperate
race against press and publicity
deadlines, most of which will have
passed by the time your Bne-up is
finalised.
As the day draws hearer the worries
start to multiply and your friends start
to get a pit sick of your one track
conversation. FELIX generously offers
you a whole page devoted to your
carnival, provided you write it (and isn't
it amazing what crap you come out
with?). You develop a nervous twitch
and start running around in little
circles.
And so, after all the effort, the sweat,
The tears, and the telephone calls, what
have we got for you?
Misty in Roots
Needless to say, as befits a band
with the more or less legendary status
of Misty even outside of Reggae circles
{in which they surely have few equals)
their agents are complete bastards to
deal with. The last time they played in
College, their agent, who we'll call Ollie
for the sake of argument, forgot to teit
them about the gig until 4pm on the
day. We've made quite certain that they
know this time.
Attila the Stockbroker and Seething
Wells
Quite possibly you haven't read the
book 'The Rising Sons of Ranting
Verse' by these two. On the other hand,
you probably did read the piece in
Time Out a few weeks ago, in which
case you'll know what to expect. In
Attila's own words. I try to combine
entertainment with ideas and if I can
get up on stage and get a good
reaction from people who don't
normally listen to poetry, then I think
I'm getting somewhere'. His pet hates
are, amongst others, 'the wimpy Nigel,
vegetables, Sun readers, and his
obsessions: 'football, flatfish and Jean
Paul Satre'. He also leaves rude
messages on his answerphone.
Circus Circus Circus
We reckon this band really are 'The
Next Big Thing'. If you ever wondered
what Cliff Richard and the Shadows
would have sounded like had Cliff been
in to se^and drugs and Hank and the
boys into Rock and Roll (yes, I
suppose they were, but don't spoil it)
then this, is the band to watch.
Woza
Woza have already been T h e next
big thing'. That was last year, when
their brand of what can best be
described as Motown on speed had
earned them headlining gigs at several
Scottish University's Freshers' Bails.
Unfortunatfey the band broke up
before they got around to playing at
them. This year, the re-formed Woza
venture down to London for the first
time. We hope they can manage not to
split up again on the the journey
down...
Freefall
A touch of class here. Dave Jago (ex-
IC student, member of Helen and the
Horns, superstar) brings his Jazz band
to College.
Bar Extension
For those of you who haven't heard of
any of the bands mentioned above,
your old favourites "Bar Extension' will
be performing until 2am.
Cocktails
Made by Links. Strange things happen
when you drink a Links cocktail. You
have been warned.
Barbeque
Courtesy of the Red Cross. Surely you
don't need me to explain what a
barbeque is?
Discos
Yes, two of these. Loud music and
flashing lights, they tell me.
Films
Ah, some good ones here: Monty
Python's 'The Meaning of Life' and
'Last Tango in Paris'. At this point I
shall be getting out my mop to clear up
yeur mess. Spare me a thought, will
you?
And finally..You!
Without whom they'd be no Carnival at
all! Yes! It's easy to see who'll be the
real stars of the show! You! Of course!
Weft, have fun.
