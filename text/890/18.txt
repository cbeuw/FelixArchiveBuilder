LETTERS
Scribblers' C o r n e r -
Athena Carries On W h a t s
6. Ok Pro-Life time. First let's talk about
the six GUYS that wrote this letter (issue
885, Da Capo), they're GUYS! God-squad
for that matter. No doubt you believe a
woman should stay at home, and have at
least five children (condoms aren't
allowed are they?) thus ballooning the
already huge population. Maybe that's a
bit extreme but 1 really have had enough
of religious self-righteous bullshit,
especially w h e n these men (?) will never
require an abortion.
Let's talk about the Pro-Life world. The
woman who is raped and reminded for
nine months of her humiliation. W h o
perhaps eventually takes her own life, or
dies having a back-street abortion. A n d
here is the bit that men cannot
comprehend: a w o m a n can feel such
maternal instinct that she would keep the
baby, even though it reminds her of her
ordeal. Or more generally, even if she
cannot properly look after it. She will
often subconciously make the child's life
hell.
For fifty thousand years, until maybe
forty years ago, the female m i n d has
developed requiring different instincts to
a man's. She must show strong maternal
instinct, must acf submissive to the man.
A n d free from the physical aspect of life,
she must develop a superior intellect vital
in ensuring the standing of the family.
H o w any men can dare to presume that
they can pass judgement o n abortion, a
thing they cannot possibly understand,
pisses me off. However it is consistent
with my view of Christian hypocrites.
Dear Andy,
In an attempt to present an honest and
'studenty' image of College life many
departments ask students to show
prospective candidates around. These
tours are only worthwhile if the
departments can find students who enjoy
the course and College life and are
willing to guide school leavers around.
The Electrical Engineering department
seems strikingly lacking in these students.
The Head of Department first sent out a
begging letter to second year students,
and when this failed to rouse the troops,
a lecturer boldly stated that students who
showed candidates around would be
added to a list. He added that being on
this list could positively affect references
given. Do 1 detect a slight hint of
blackmail?
But for those of you who are undecided
I would say this. The problem we face is
not so simple as the Pro Life make out.
What must come from discussion is
practical law. E v e n regardless of any
moral question, the facts are that w o m e n
will always require abortion. The Irish
alternative appears to be inhibit sex
education, religiously prohibit the use of
contraceptives, and make abortion illegal.
Back-street abortions are reason enough
to allow legal abortion. The law must set
S O M E time period after w h i c h abortion is
illegal (the m a x i m u m being the time at
which the baby can safely be removed
and survive). However it is m y opinion
that the ultimate decision should be that
of the woman involved.
7. 'God created m a n in his o w n image'
only because the bible was written by a
man.
8. Will you God fearing idiots stop
treating the bible as if its reliable,
unbiased, primary history evidence. W h y
add '(John 3:16)' as if it proves its true?
The bible was written by men. Men are
corrupt. W h y do you believe it?
One Christian said that G o d had told
him the bible was true. W h e n 1 put it to
him that Mormons say that God tells
them that the book of M o r m o n is true he
said that they are halucinating. So I put it
to him that he says that it is possible for
someone to halucinate visions of God.
Everyone except him that is!!
Yours,
Athena.
I would normally be very happy to take
people around, I did so often at m y old
school, but 1 w o u l d be honest and almost
certainly strongly discourage most
applicants from coming.
The problem is not only the Electrical
Engineering department. I a m
embarrassed when I see students being
taken around the Union Building, through
a probably empty and not too clean
snack bar, and shown the lively and
friendly hack bar.
Until I feel that I can truthfully say that
the course is stimulating and has an
element of practicality 1 shall not be
volunteering to take people around.
1 have asked the editor to withhold my
name from this article in case it adversely
affects m y references.
