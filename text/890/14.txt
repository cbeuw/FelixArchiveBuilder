Cat Rapes Dog
—Gods, Guns & Gasoline LP
Pure electro thrash, Cat Rapes Dog come
at you thick and fast. The beat is
pounding, ceaseless. The vocals hoarse
and tortured.This is the sound of a
corrupt society leading to death.
Gods, Guns and Gasoline is the first
album from this Swedish duo and it's not
from the same planet as Abba. Kicking
the shit out of the corpse of acid house,
the album draws its inspiration from
similar 'electro terrorists' like Frontline
Assembly, Front 242 and Skinny Puppy.
The major theme is seen in the first
track, American Dream, 'this is m y rifle,
this is m y gun', and continues down the
track list with songs like Homo Bulldozer
and An Ass For A Brain. A n d make no
mistake, these are songs, not a mindless
beat with drivel over the top. Each one is
C A R E F U L L Y tortured — these people
want to scare, want to obliterate. Even
then, a tune seems in danger of poking
out of some tracks, particularly the title
song.

Golden Generation does reveal a post
1988 feel serving only to improve the
album by slightly distancing the band
from their hard-beat contempories. But
then, Allt Hag Jar re-emphasises Cat
Rapes Dog's stance. The vocals crawling
over a carefully sequenced d r u m and bass
pattern and the sample actually fits in!
This is dance music with a difference.
No mindless drug haze here but a
heightened state, tight rhythms and a
clean production clawing at your feet.
Music for the modern w o r l d as it tries to
destroy itself.

—Pink Panther (Panthera Rosa) 12
Pink by name, pink by cover and pink
vinyl. The deluge of utter pinkness that
radiates from the turntable is blinding. 1
haven't seen anything this pink since
Lullaby. The only thing to anticipate is
the coloured cassette single.
The song is as bright and happy as the
pretty pink cover but a lot less distressing
on the eyes and brain. But... unlucky!
The only memorable thing about this IS
the pink vinyl, as unless Panthera Rosa is
a flower, there's little else to do with odd-
coloured cats or Inspector Clueso.
The flip holds a couple of equally
unmemorable tracks. Rainy Day is a
damp dirge of misery, but is envigoured
by the last track. This is a heady folky
swirl complete with violins, harmonica
and inappropriate vocals. Never mind.
The A-side is 'nice' enough to make up
for it, as it left me tripping across sunny
blooms with the sweet scent of flowers in
the air.
Mind-numbing relief after a visual
burn-out.

—Sugarhlast 12"
I must admit when I first received this
record I cringed, the cover wreaked of
Manchester. But was I in for a surprise?
After wrestling with m y flatmates record
player, which seems to enjoy playing
records at every speed except 45rpm, I
was greeted by a fade-in of feedback
which led into an Interesting Bass Line. I
felt at first that this rhythm should be
annoying me but I liked it. Things got
better; in came some excellent chunky
guitar followed by relaxed vocals that
may have been happier on a slow Happy
Mondays song. These soon changed as
the song got louder and louder with
choruses of 'Sugarblast' being screached
and gloriously overdriven guitar
screaming in the forefront.
The track ends by unexpectedly
changing into a dreamy drug induced
sequence of soft vocals and odd noises
which lead perfectly into the next track, /
Am The Sky, w h i c h sounds like an
adventure into the realms of the delay
pedal. Just as the track gets going it is
sadly faded out only to be continued on
the B-side as an intro to the final song,
Marshmallow Madness. This starts off
with some beautiful flanged guitar and
mellow lyrics that lure you into a false
sense of security then once again the
guitars take over in a confusion of
overdrive and wah-wah. I don't know if
they have released an album but if so it's
definitely worth a look at.
