Rip-Off!
Dear Andy,
M y parents were furious that m y
graduation photographs were, in the
words of the photographers 'unsuccessful'.
This didn't happen to just me—my
girlfriend's photos were similarly
unsuccessful, and I would like to know to
how many others this happened.
The company to blame are 'Camera T
from Cheshire. As far as I a m aware
these are the only graduation day
photographers, as they are the only ones
that College told us about in the
graduation day information. A t other
universities there are normally several
competing firms. A n y b o d y graduating
next year would be well advised to
choose a different company if possible.
Camera 7 have returned m y money
(you pay when your photo is taken and
not when the photos arrive), and offered
to retake my photo for free. They have
not told me how, where or when, or
whether they will provide the gown,
which cost nearly £20 to hire. Perhaps
then m y parents will calm down.
Yours annoyed,
Tim Walker, Physics PG.
Dear Andy,
Thank you for the inclusion of the SCC
colours report in F E L I X . A fascinating
article showing the depth and perception
of journalistic intuition symbolic of the
student newspaper at Imperial.
Slighly concerned w h y it was printed
6V2 months after it was submitted, but a
small price to pay for honouring those of
yesteryear.
May 1 also take this opportunity in
reminding S C C clubs that colours
nominations for the session 1995/96
should be submitted as soon as possible
so as to make allowances for the red tape
to follow.
Yours,
Spenser Lane, SCC Chairman.
Peace (?)
Dear FELIX,
The tragic situation in the Gulf does not
leave anyone unmoved. We are at war.
People are dying—being murdered. It
does not matter what political stance you
take—we are all faced with the stark
reality that a terrorist campaign could kill
us or a member of our family. There are
no easy resolutions to the situation.
Whatever settlement is reached—if one
is—it may have disastrous consequences
on the future of the Middle East.
What can I do, as an individual eager
to see an end to this war? There is only
one perfect solution to this crisis—peace
that comes from God. There is no way
that I would claim that G o d is on
anyone's side . Whether Christian, Jew,
Muslim or adherent to another faith, we
must unite in prayer to bring peace to
this situation and peace o n God's terms.
This is a plea to all to pray for peace.
There will be a Christian prayer meeting
to pray for peace in the gulf. This will be
organised hopefully, by a joint body of
representatives from all the student
Christian groups in the college and will
be advertised on posters around campus.
1 would urge m y Jewish and Islamic
friends, among others, to arrange similar
meetings.
Let me finish with a thought.
'For our struggle is not against flesh
and blood, but against the rulers, against
the authorities, against the powers of this
dark world and against the spiritual
forces of evil in the heavenly realm'
(Ephesians 6:12).
God bless you all,
Mark Randall.
Racism
or Fact?
Dear FELIX,
I wish to complain about your reporting
of the Union bar brawl (FELIX 18.1.91). I
did not feel it was of any relevance to
indicate the colour of the m a n arrested
for brawling. H a d he been white I'm sure
the sentence would not have read
'Attention was drawn to a white man
who was harassing girls'. Sounds silly
doesn't it?
I can only assume that the article was
written by the same person who referred
to Enoch Powell as the 'special guest' at
the Conservative society annual dinner.
Yours sincerely,
Dilip Chauhan, Chemistry PG.
