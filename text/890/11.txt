Sax Appeal
this.they ended up repeating one of the
numbers that they had sung earlier, but
nobody seemed to mind. A great band,
and well worth seeing in future.
The next band downstairs was Sax
Appeal, a jazz band consisting entirely of
saxophones (what a surprise!) and
percussion. They played fairly heavily,
with a distinct beat, presumably to make
their music more popular and more
danceable. Unfortunately they failed on
both counts. The music was too heavy to
succeed as jazz and didn't have enough
clear melody to dance to. A pity, since
they had been billed in the same room
that the disco had been located earlier.
Since the band failed in their
compromise, they scored a definite and
resounding miss.
Now for the high point of the evening,
the band that everybody came to see.
Desmond Decker was fabulous; the
concert hall was packed out and
everybody was dancing. You've heard
The Israelite (OK then, the Vitalite
advert). That was good. This was better.
Desmond Decker live is something else.
He strutted around stage like a demented
chicken. That said, this chicken has style,
and was dressed in full leathers.
Somehow all the songs seemed to sound
like The Israelite but the repetition didn't
get boring. Desmond's enthusiasm, along
with that of the rest of his band, kept
everbody amused, and dancing. The
concert hall was as full as I have ever
seen it. There's only one w a y to describe
Desmond Decker; out of this world.
As usual, Guilds organised the casino,
which was packed (as always), and an
almost constant barrage of films was
available in the senior c o m m o n room.
Tickets came close to selling out, and
there was very little trouble; one jerk
stuck his hand through a window, but
that was about it. What a night!
