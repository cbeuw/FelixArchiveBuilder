Fighting for Arts
Dear Andy,
Much as I hate to dignify A l a n Bailey's
uneducated and, I suspect, deliberately
controversial rant in the last FELIX, 1 feel
his comments cannot be allowed to pass
without reply.
Before I specifically refute his
accusations against the performing arts
themselves, I would like to point out the
inherently contradictory nature of Mr
Bailey's own argument. First he criticised
the arts as the preserve of the monied
minority, and then demands that subsidies
should be withdrawn, which would serve
no purpose other than to force the ticket
prices up, out of the hands of even more
people, or even force the theatres to
close. The matter of subsidies is not one
of cheaper tickets for people who would
not notice the difference, but of survival
for our main arts centres.
To say that 'no one gave a toss' about
the closure of the Barbican Theatre
shows that M r Bailey doesn't pay very
close attention to the media. For several
weeks afterwards the papers were full of
articles and discussion on this very point,
and on the general state of theatre in this
country. The only reason that there has
been nothing since is that the subject has
been condemned to the media limbo of
'Old News'. He apparently knows nothing
of the massive fundraising campaign to
save the Y o u n g Vic when it too entered a
financial crisis. Solely through public
support this young innovative theatre was
saved.
Mr Bailey also seems to misunderstand
the role of the arts. Only a very small
proportion of the arts output is to
produce a thing of beauty solely for
entertainment's sake. Ironically, those that
do are often the most successful, take for
example Lloyd-Webber's musicals. They
have little or no educational, or political
value, yet are by far the most successful
productions in the West End. Virtually
every other piece of theatre tries in some
way to question moral, political and social
issues, to leave its audience not only
entertained, but also educated, or at least
more informed of the complex questions
that dominate our lives. This, I suspect, is
Mr Bailey's real objection to the arts. His
phrase 'Pathetic government bashing
ethnic fringe theatres' reveals all too
clearly that he doesn't like the idea of
anybody criticising or questioning his
beloved (extreme) right w i n g views. Such
debate, Alan, is fundamental to a
democracy such as ours. Freedom of
speech is rather important, you know.
Have you ever been to the theatre? Not
all of it, if any, is performed with purely
anti-Tory motives.
Indeed, the only reason that the big
companies need subsidising is that too
many people have Mr Bailey's bigoted
type views, and are unwilling to try
something different, and, dare I say it,
more challenging than a day at the footy.
If more people did try the theatre, more
would enjoy it, and subsidy would be
unnecessary, because of increased
attendance. One only needs look at the
roaring success of the theatre in Glasgow,
leading to its nomination as last year's
city of culture to see that.
But I forgot didn't I? Scots don't vote
Tory.
Yours rationally,
Pendragon.
P.S. I heartily agree that more money
should be given to the NHS, but I think it
could come from a better source. Perhaps
the huge profits made by many 1st
Division football clubs, or a tax on the
million pound transfer fees?
Pro Censorship?
Dear Sir,
As Editor of FELIX, I am sure that you
try to print as many of the letters that
you receive as is possible, regardless of
whether you agree with the content or
not, in order to allow a full range of
views and arguments to be presented.
However I feel that at some point, you
must exercise your editorial power and
say 'no' to letters which cannot enhance
or enliven your magazine in any way.
I refer in particular to the letter in last
Friday's issue (Jan 18) from 'a Real Man',
on the subject of shagging.
I assume the author wrote the letter as
a joke, to be provocative. If you decided
to print the letter for the same reason
then I must objectâ€”since this letter is
obviously a (sick) joke, then anyone
writing in to protest will be dismissed as
a raving feminist with no sense of
humour. If your aim in printing the letter
was to show what a sad case some of the
men at IC are, then w hy bother? We can
all see that by looking around the JCR
everyday.
Although it may be true that letters
printed do not reflect the views of the
editor, I think that you do not do yourself
justice if you allow complete crap to be
published.
Yours sincerely,
Alison Payne, PG Elec Eng.
