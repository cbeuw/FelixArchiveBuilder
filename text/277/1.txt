IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 277 8th MAY, 1369 6d.
Discipline impasse
C r i s i s l o o m s
Today, assuming there hsu,
been no settlement of the
ASTMS University technician
pay claim, the Imperial Col-
lege Branch of the union will
be in the last day of a three
day official strike designed to
support their demands for a
10 per cent increase. As the
IC Open Day goes ahead, 500
pickets including Clive Jen-
kins, General Secretary of
ASTMS, and Ian Mikardo
MP, the President, will be
demonstrating around the
college. Technical staff from
other colleges will also be
here to show their support.
Last week's one day
national strike by ASTM^
pulled out all but a handful
of the 520 members in IC.
Mech. Eng., Elec. Eng. and
RSM were heavily hit by the
walkout.
A.U.T. decision
The day after the strike,
the IC branch of the Associ-
ation of University Teachers
met to discuss their attitude
towards the present 3 day
stoppage and, with an attend-
ance of just under 35 mem-
bers, a two-thirds majority
said they would do all they
The Jurgo sub-committee,
set up to hammer out differ-
ences between the authorities
and the Union over discipline
procedures, after making
some progress now appears
deadlocked. The sub-com-
mittee consisting of three
Union representatives — Rex
Lowin, ICU President, Mar-
tin Bland, SCC Chairman,
and Rob Collinge, Welfare
Officer, and three representa-
tives from the authorities is
chaired by Dr. Ware a gov-
ernor with some legal ex-
perience.
'Courts'
A structure of discipline
'courts' has been agr,eed cul-
minating in an Appeals com-
mittee. Four bodies have the
right to give summary punish-
ments, Hall committees (who
will take over the Warden's
responsibility for punish-
ment), Union, Departments
(who will be allowed to ex-
clude people from lectures or
labs and levy fees for break-
ages but not expel students)
and the Senior Warden.
Either the accused of these
bodies (who then become the
accusers) can take offences
to a discipline Committee
consisting of three authorities
and three students with a
Dean as chairman; the Presi-
dent will as a result of negoti-
ations have a say with the
Rector in the appointment of
this chairman. The Appeal
committee, the pinnacle of
the tier system will compro-
mise two students, one of
whom will usually be the
President, and two authori-
ties, usually including the
pro-Rector, a governor will
be chairman.
The first main concession
won by Union negotiators
has been the agreement to
drop the nebulous charge of
'bringing the good name of
the college into disrepute'.
However the central issue of
double punishment remains
unresolved. The college seem
to insist on the right to punish
people who have previously
been tried by the courts of
land. This issue has already
caused one storm at an I.C.
union meeting when a motion
was passed overwhelmingly
refusing to accept double
punishment under any cir-
cumstances and mandating
the Governors to this effect
by the end of the session. I.C.
students were hoping that
through JURGO the college
would, by negotiation, agree
to drop their support for
double punishment. This is
the stage that has been
reached.
A week ago when the sub-
ject was raised at the sub-
committee no progress was
made. The three authorities'
reps, according to reports,
were not prepared to aban-
don the principle of double
punishment but tried to ne-
gotiate procedures to enforce
it. They suggested two trials,
the first to decide whether to
proceed with double disci-
pline. Reports suggest that
the chairman of the commit-
tee Dr. Ware was a strong
opponent of the union repre-
sentatives, and attempted to
move the discussion off the
main topics onto legal argu-
ments. President Rex Lowin
believes that when the
strength of Union opposition
to double punishment is
known, the Governor's rep-
resentatives may be more
amenable to negotiation.
Next move
Union officials are divided
as to what the next move
from the Rector's side will
be. Some feel that an attempt
will be made to split 'moder-
ate' and 'militant' opinion, by
an attempt to push a compro-
mise through. There seems at
this stage little likelihood of
success for such a move as
I.C. sudents are united on
what is basically a non-
political issue. Other officials
suggest that the Rector might
step in to prevent the present
impasse developing into the
kind of crisis that has led to
'sit-ins' at other colleges. To
many council members how-
ever, the negotiations involve,
besides the issue of justice,
the whole future of JURGO.
If the talks fail to eliminate
the possibility of double dis-
cipline they feel JURGO will
have proved to have been
worse than useless.
• Spike Bantin will be
writing an article opposing
double punishment in the
next issue of FELIX. April 29ths Picket
could "to ensure the success
of Open Day". The long
motion, put toward by the
AUT committee, reorganized
the vital role which tech-
nicians play in the successful
teaching of Science and Tech-
nology and, believing that
they were under - valued,
wished them success in then-
pay fight. Nevertheless the
remainder of the motion
stated that the IC AUT
believed the "good name of
the college and the best
interests of staff are inseper-
able" and so AUT members
should ensure the success of
Open Day.
This is not in accord with
the official AUT line, but Dr.
Newey, secretary of IC AUT,
said it was up to individual
members to place their own
interpretation on the motion.
A member interviewed after
the meeting was uncertain
that a lot of staff would
actually follow the AUT line.
Arthur Sier, branch chairman
of ASTMS, said he couldn't
understand how they (the
lecturers) could support the
AUT line on one day and not
on the other 3 days.
Nice footnote from the dis-
pute. When the college com-
puter came to deduct a day's
pay from the technicians after
the April 29 stoppage, it
merely took off a seventh of
the weekly rate since it works
on a 7 day week. ASTMS
wouldn't stand for this as
accepting a one seventh de-
duction would imply accept-
ing a 7 day week with ob-
vious comebacks on overtime
and holidays. Accordingly,
the college have had to spend
money on converting the
computer to a 5 day week.
Guilds failure rate shock
The interim report of the
Working Party on Student
Failures produces figures
which show that the failure
rate of C and G students is
way above that for other con-
stituent Colleges. Taking an
average over the past five
years, the percentage failures
in C and G in the first and
second years are 12 per cent
and 13 per cent respectively;
the equivalent figures for
R.C.S. are 9 per cent and 6
per cent. Since the Party feels
that although 1st year failures
may be due partly to academ-
ic reasons, subsequent failures
should be due mainly to non-
academic factors, and should
therefore "be smaller in pro-
portion", it has centred its
attention on C and G depart-
ments.
The report starts by sug-
gesting that since Engineering
courses are wider in scope,
the value of School subjects
as preparation is necessarily
less than for Science subjects.
The report goes on to state
that "the insistence upon
relevance to industry poses
fresh intellectual problems,
and the range of knowledge
required may be such that
the relationship of parts to
the whole is hard to grasp."
Tests
The Working Party sees no
grounds for suggesting a
change in the present stand-
ard of examinations in engin-
eering subjects, and it finds
no evidence to suggest that a
certain proportion of students
are doomed to automatic
failure (sic). It proposes that
the present system could be
improved by providing a
series of tests throughout the
year, to provide preparation
for examinations; that exam-
inations should be adjusted
in time "so as not to, provide
undue strain on candidates",
and that some idea of marks
obtained in examinations
should be given to students.
Great emphasis is placed
in the report on the need to
balance the quantity of work
between the 1st and 2nd
years. Since a number of
students have covered at least
a small proportion of their
first year work at school, they
may be encouraged to "place
too great an emphasis on
extra-curricular activities". In
one department 43 per cent
of the third year students felt
that the 2nd year course was
overloaded. The present pro-
cedure of providing a Com-
mon Course in the 1st year
also comes under fire, since
it tends to breed lack of
interest in the main subject.
The diversion of interest in
the first year also tends to
cause some overloading in
the 2nd year.
Pass degree
After discussing the need
for improvement in the
tutorial arrangements in the
second year, the report con-
cludes that what it terms
"rescue operations" should
be introduced as a solution to
a number of problems. It
quotes the 70 per cent pass
rate obtained in 1st year re-
sits elsewhere as good reason
for introducing the same
procedure in C and G and
recommends the introduction
if Pass Degree csurses in the
3rd year to cater for marginal
failures, who would otherwise
be forced to re-sit 2nd year
examinations 12 months later
to get back onto the third
year course. The report
quotes figures from R.C.S.
departments to support this
move: in Physics the outright
failure rate of 1.2 per cent in
1968 would have been 16.1
per cent if it had not been for
the pass degree course, which
14.9 per cent opted to take.
The Working Party stresses
that their report is only in-
terim, and suggests that long
term investigations over 2 or
3 years are needed to produce
a Final Report on the sub-
ject of student failures. Some
students have been shocked
by the report's complacent
attitude to the exam system
in the College.
