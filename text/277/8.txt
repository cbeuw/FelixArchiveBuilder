Convocation to hear
Ruhemann motion
A motion to be proposed
at London University Convo-
cation on May 13th contains
a number of highly topical
points. Seconded by Pete
Ruhemann, chairman of IC
SCC last year, it welcomes
the NUS-VC statement of
October last year which, ac-
cording to the motion, em-
phasises the importance of
student participation on com-
mittees, and in disciplinary
procedures, staff-student dis-
cussion of courses and exams,
and freedom of expression of
unpopular opinions.
A second part of the mo-
tion notes developments with-
in the University in the spirit
of the statement but expresses
grave concern at events which
suggest the principles of stu-
dent participation are neither
welcomed nor put into prac-
tice. The events the motion
quotes are " the continuing
confrontation at LSE", the
pressures on certain students
active in the " Save Woburn
Square" campaign, and the
" racial discrimination " af-
fair in relation to the Univer-
sity Lodgings Bureau.
Applicants shun
Student Houses
It appears that there will
be little difficulty in appli-
cants to Student Houses being
given places, as only about
50 application have been re-
ceived for up to 350 places if
the new Houses are opened
on time. Rejected applications
for Hall are passed on to the
Student Houses if the appli-
cant wishes, so these will be
used to fill up the remaining
places.
There is some disagree-
ment over the opening date
of the new Houses. Due to
this uncertainty, it has been
decided that the 69 fresher
residents will be given prefer-
ence.
Thirty five people have ap-
plied for the posts of War-
dents for the new Houses, and
12 have been selected for
further interview with their
wives or fiancees.
In Bernard Sunley House,
the rule that residence for
more than half a session
counts as a full year has been
relaxed this year, as many
residents have been living in
for just over the half ses-
sion, and because of the con-
siderable hardship already
undergone by many of these
people.
Application forms for
P.Gs. who want a place over
the Summer Vacation, main-
ly in the Student Houses, are
now available from the Halls
of Residence office.
Confirmed
On Thursday, May 15th
(Ascension Day), a number
of students from IC will be
confirmed at a service at St.
Augustine's Church, Queen's
Gate, at 6.15 p.m. There will
be a buffet supper afterwards.
IC "not happy"
From time to time various
students have approached
their academic representa-
tives to express a desire for
non-technical studies to be
included in their degree
course. As a result, the aca-
demic representatives of the
Constituent College Unions
circulated a questionnaire to
assess the demand for such
courses, and therefore to de-
cide whether there is a case
for action at College level.
Their report had been pub-
lished this week.
Clearly, students are not
happy with the General Stud-
ies scheme available at pre-
sent. General Studies com-
pete with other activities—
including lunch. Some de-
partments already offer non-
technical courses as part of
the degree course but prac-
tice varies between depart-
ments. RSC notably do not
offer these courses whilst
Electrical Engineering is par-
ticularly progressive in this
respect.
In the USA the advanced
technical universities, Massa-
chusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and California Insti-
ture of Technology in par-
ticudar, permit their students
to include a considerable
number of non-technical
subjects as part of their
degree. The questionnaire
was circulated among just
over 2,000 students of which
exactly 1,000 replied.
4 per cent Opposition
The most impressive con-
clusion that can be drawn
from the replies is that over
one third of those who re-
plied would like non-techni-
cal studies to comprise more
than 20 per cent of the assess-
ment for their degree. Only
4 per cent were opposed to
the introduction of non-
technical studies irrespective
of whether or not it was in-
cluded as part of theirdegree.
The most popular subject
requested, out of a number
suggested, was Economics.
Psychology was second.
Students participating were
invited to add any comments
and these were principally
either endorsing the need for
non-technical subjects or ex-
pressing the opinion that it
was essential to make time
available for such studies.
The results indicate quite
clearly that students are dis-
satisfied with over-specialisa-
tion. Non-technical courses
are not wanted as soft options
but as serious studies.
Urgency
It is now a matter of ur-
gency that facilities should be
made available to offer alter-
native subjects: ninety-six
per cent of the present stud-
ents who replied to the ques-
tionnaire want them. The re-
port makes various sugges-
tions for short-term solutions,
including making courses in
other colleges of the univer-
sity available as part of the
degree courses here.
Perhaps the final word
should be had by someone
from Physics who comment-
ed on his questionnaire :
" I came to IC for the
simple reason that there
were no auxiliary courses
of humanities, s o c i a l
sciences, etc. Had I wanted
them I would have gone
elsewhere. The fact is that
I am a narrow-minded
scientist and wish to remain
so."
Lodgings
Bureau
threat
Rumours are rampant that
the proposed West London
branch of the University of
London Lodgings Bureau at
Imperial College will adopt
the same listing of landlords,
according to the skin pigment
of tenants they will accept,
and that direct action is be-
ing planned to prevent the
new Bureau opening. How-
ever it is likely, in view of offi-
cial Council policy and pres-
sure from overseas students
that the college authorities
will be asked to take action
before any incidents can
occur.
Jarvis hits trouble over
Status Quo letter
Legal Action is being
threatened against Ian Jarvis,
the Carnival Co-ordinator
following comments made by
him about the pop group
Status Quo in a letter to
their agency after the ill-fated
Albert Hall Concert. In this
letter he expressed his disgust
at the behaviour of the Status
Quo during the concert.
Solicitors for the group re-
plied, demanding an unquali-
fied apology and withdrawal
and an offer of a reasonable
sum to compensate the Status
Quo within seven days or
action would be taken. This
was not done, and the entire
matter is now in the hands
of the College Solicitors.
The total loss on the con-
cert has now been added up
to £1344 15s., which has been
paid from collecting tin
money, as reported previous-

Improved decor lightens bar atmosphere
The revamped Union Bar
was opened to its regulars at
the beginning of term. At a
cost of approximately £1300,
almost all of which was pro-
vided by various breweries,
the improved decor now al-
lows Gus, the barman, to
move in lounge furniture on
a Sunday to create an atmos-
phere in which women do not,
as in the past, feel out of
place.
Gus himself feels the new
decor is a vast improvement
but cannot comment on con-
sumer reaction until the regu-
lars return from their pre-
exam hibernation. Initial re-
action has, however, been
favourable; as one drinker
commented : "the old atmos-
phere has been maintained
despite the improvements".
Much of the improvement
is to the woodwork, which
has been cleaned and varnish-
ed. The bar counter itself has
had an extension to its width,
which had brought about a
marked decrease in the
amount of beer spilt over the
edge. If, when the hordes re-
turn, any beer does creep
over the edge it will not meet
with the old wooden floor but
with a more resistant con-
crete verge.
The trade-mark of the old
bar still remains, however;
despite having been cleaned
and waxed the floor is rapidly
reverting to its old beer-
stained form. Gus hopes that
the planned reclean, and var-
nish with a different tech-
nique will, however, add the
finishing touch to the new
creation.
