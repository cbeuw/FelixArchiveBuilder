PRE APRES SKI Rugby Club Irish Tour See page 6
The Easter trip and the
usual apres ski activities (?)
of the ski club were added
to, this year, by the rather
more energetic sport (despite
what twisters and shakers
may think) of ski-racing. The
cash-and-crash merchants
had three opportunities to
emulate Jean-Claude Killy.
At the beginning of last
term, 2 members of the ski
club motored up to Glenshee
in Scotland to compete in a
slalom race organised by the
Scottish Universities Ski
Club. Despite the fact that
these poor individuals had to
spend the night on a floor
(after being drugged with
alcohol by the opposition),
George Hamer managed to
come 12th and Roger Lee
14th out of a field of about
50.
On the second occasion
George Hamer and Adrian
du Vallon went up again to
Glenshee with a small party
from the London ski club to
take part in a giant slalom.
A strong wind and the tra-
ditional Scottish mist made
it very difficult for the late
starters but George Hamer
came 27th and Adrian du
Vallon 30th out of about 55
starters.
Finally, during the Easter
vacation, Roger Lee compet-
ed in the British Universities
Ski Championships in the
Cairngorms, as a member of
the London University team,
who despite this setback,
were placed 4th overall be-
hind Aberdeen, Oxford and
Edinburgh.
Next Christmas I.C. Ski
Club racers will be joining
the London team for training
in Davos as well as compet-
ing in several races in Scot-
land during the Spring term.
If there are any budding
skiers (racers or not) who
have escaped us, I would very
much like to hear from them
via the Union letter rack.
If it's any consolation at all,
next year's British Universi-
ties Championships are again
being sponsored by William
Younger & Co. . . .

Even over the water the members of I.C. Rugby club
could not escape from the influence of Mooney. Nevertheless
it goes without saying that a good time was had by all.

I.C. 6.
The first two fixtures this
season augur well for the
club's tour of France in June
which has had a tremendous
effect on team morale.
The Sunday before last saw
a friendly fixture against a
rather weak Lower tennis
Club in which, after a shaky
start, I.C. won all 5 matches
outright.
Last Saturday's away fix-
ture against the Royal Col-
lege of Vets was the first
round of the U.L.U. cup, and
was convincingly won 6-0
with only one set being drop-
ped.
I.C. SQUASH CLUB
VICTORIOUS
Welsh Soccer Tour
The evening of Monday,
March 17th, brought a great
victory to I.C. Squash Club.
After storming through the
semi-finals at the expense of
the College of Estate Manage-
ment, the I.C. team went on
to narrowly defeat U.C. by
11 points in a very close and
tense final.
J. Edwards and C. Wall
lost in straight games, but
earned enough points to keep
our hopes alive. I. Blair and
M. Ala had to win in straight
games, yielding as few points
as possible, and they duly did
this. I. Blair gave one of the
best performances of his car-
eer, conceding only 9 points
and winning a game to love.
Inspired by this, M . Ala
played a very tight match,
making few unforced mis-
takes and allowing his oppon-
ent to win a mere 10 points.
The entire fate of the cup
depended on this last match.
It is extremely satisfying
to see the materialisation of
our aim and endeavours, for
which all those involved are
heartily congratulated.

Ten members of the
I.C.A.F.C. tour party left
London on Saturday March
22nd and on the evening of
the same day received a very
cordial welcome from the
landlady of a very exclusive
Llandudno guest house in
which we were to be the only
guests for a week. The first
two days were spent getting
acclimatised, but unfortun-
ately, acclimatisation proved
to be rather difficult on the
Sunday as Llandudno was
found to be in a "dry"
county. However it was soon
The Red Base Theory
Continued from page 2
A long debate on the "red-
base theory" followed. This
is the building up of politi-
cally conscious groups in the
Unversities, and increasing
political awareness and mili-
tancy there with the aim of
carrying this to the working
class by example. This was
supported by the New-Left
Review Group, the Inter-
national Marxist Group and
many unaligned delegates.
The critics (mainly the Inter-
national Socialists and the
Maoists) condemned the
stratagem as petit-bourgeois
and isolationist, and as an
attempt to substitute student
for workers' struggle. Much
of the debate centred round
the events at LSE, and con-
tributions from Nick Bateson
(against) and Robin Black-
burn (for) were received. All
speakers stressed the need
to build a revolutionary
movement with strong theory,
and the obvious problem
was fusion with the working
class. The termination of this
debate, becaues of the lack
of time, gave rise to the only
disorder of the conference,
since it occurred immediate-
ly prior to Manchanda's con-
tribution. The Maoists halted
proceedings for about twenty
minutes until a compromise
was reached (to continue the
debate the next day).
The Ulster (People's Dem-
ocracy) representative took
complete advantage of the
disorder to follow it by an
impassioned demagoguic
speech, in which, to scat-
tered applause (?) he attack-
ed everyone, urging them to
prove the pudding by an
Easter weekend in Ireland.
The second day included
a talk, discussion and ques-
tion time with four repre-
sentatives of Ford workers;
the adoption of the 'red-base
theory' as official policy; the
proposal of a series of policy
and solidarity motions; and
finally the adoption of an
official, RSSF manifesto, a
condition of membership be-
ing acceptance of the general
principles therein. This latter
may prove a thorn in the
sides of several groups of
RSSF members, since it pre-
cludes the existence of any
party at present capable of
revolutionary leadership. The
conference closed with a
rousing version of the ' Inter-
nationale ', and, just for once,
everybody knew the words,
if not the tune.

TEN PIN
BOWLING CLUB
Since the last report in
FELIX, there has only been
one match, which was at the
end of last term against Sus-
sex University, down at Hove.
Sussex have a small club
and so could only put out 3
three-man teams as opposed
to the 5-man games which
we normally play. However,
what they lack in numbers
they make up for in perform-
ance. Our 2nds and 3rds were
a long-way outclassed but the
1st team game turned out to
be a superbly close match
which we were unfortunate
to lose by only 7 pins out of
a total pin-fall of about 3000.
This was such a close match
all the way that even the
opposition said that the just
result should have been a
draw. Top series scores of the
day were D. Foster 519, and
R. Owen 517.
The 720 series scored by
Dave Foster at the end of
last term which broke East
Acton's house record is al-
most certainly the British
Universities' record.
Stevenson Cup to R.C.S.
R.C.S. have won the Stephenson Cup, the constituent
college mens' hockey trophy. They secured overall victory
by drawing 2-2 with Guilds on the last Sunday of the Easter
term, in what proved to be an even, exciting game.
Guilds took the lead through Mudan early in the game, but
goals by Thacker and Andrews saw R.C.S. with a lead at
half-time. The second half was a fluctuating affair with first
R.C.S., then Guilds seeming to get on top, culminating in
Bates equalising for Guilds a few minutes from the end.
Earlier in the season R.C.S. has beaten Mines 2-1 with
goals scored by Roper and Vincent, and Guilds later lost
to Mines by the same score.
R.C.S. team:— Stevart; Smith; Anderson; Stewart, Roper
(capt); Vincent; Hobbs; Thacker; Adams; Andrews; Bowler.
realised that a short bus ride
took us across the border into
Colwyn Bay, which was
"wet".
On Tuesday, joined by the
last two members of the
party, we travelled to Saint
Asaph to play the high school
there in what proved to be an
easy match I.C. winning 6-3.
Q u i t e a few spectators
watched the game and the
I.C. goalkeeper complained
about objects thrown from
behind the goal. These were
found to be lollipop sticks
and not beer bottles, as first
thought.
The evening was spent in
Rhyl, which, although it is
supposed to be the main holi-
day resort of this coast was
rather deserted while we were
there.
Wednesday saw us faced
with our hardest game of the
tour and with two casualties,
one player having a bad
attack of 'flue and the other
needing a visit to the physio-
therapist at the local hospital
for treatment. Both players
turned out in the afternoon,
however, and we managed to
beat John Bright G.S. 4-3 in
a very closely fought game.
The opposition were strength-
ened by the inclusion of 3 or
4 players of local league
experience and this was a
good win for the I.C. team.
The next day I.C. moved
along the coast to Abergele to
play their third game in three
days. The pitch looked as if
it had been freshly ploughed
for the game and at half-time
with the score 0-0 it seemed
that we might lose our 100
per cent record. However in
the second half I.C. got on
top of the opposition and
eventually mastered the pitch
to finish the game 4-1 win-
ners. The final evening was
spent, as might be expected,
visiting some, or even most
of the most refreshing places
in Llandudno.
The players deserve con-
gratulation on their fine
record on tour. Although the
opposition was not, in most
cases, too strong, it was the
first time that the players,
taken from the 1st X I to 4th
XI had played together and
they gave quite a lot of effort
and enthusiasm to play as a
team.
