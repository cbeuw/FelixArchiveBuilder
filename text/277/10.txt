auspices of ASTMS c a l l e d a meeting on 2nd. May to discuss the proposal that PGs
should be p a i d on a s a l a r i e d b a s i s . This would give PGs better bargaining r i g h t s ,

SUCCESSFUL MAY BALL - L e t t e r
Deal" S i r ,
May 1 take t h i s opportunity to thank a l l those concerned i n making l a s t F r i d a y ' s
May B a l l so enjoyable. Having been to s e v e r a l functions of t h i s s o r t , I f e l t that
t h i s was the best, and thoroughly good v a l u e . This opinion was r e f l e c t e d by others
I have spoken t o , and the receptions given to Kenny B a l l and the Bob Kerr Whoopee
Band made them the obvious h i g h l i g h t s .
But when, oh when, w i l l the Union see f i t to g e t t i n g some good sound equipment
for the films? T h i s , to my mind, was the only thing that could s e r i o u s l y be f a u l t e d
i n an otherwise worthwhile ocaasion.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y , S.D. Walter.
