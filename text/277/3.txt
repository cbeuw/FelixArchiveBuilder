Student house shock
Relevance of Essex
Dear Sir,
With reference to the rec-
ent demonstrations at the
University of Essex during
the visit of the Select Com-
mittee C on student relations,
I feel that the national press
has, deliberately or other-
wise, completely ignored or
misrepresented the point that
was being made by the de-
monstrators.
With the pending visit of
the same Select Committee
to IC I should like to take
the opportunity of stressing
the point of the demonstrat-
ors, as I feel it is very rele-
vant for us.
The Commons Select Com-
mittee on Education has been
and will continue to, travel
the Universities collecting,
primarily, information on
student unrest. It does, there-
fore, seem ludicrous to me
that the Select Committee is
not meeting the one group of
sudents who are most able to
give them the relevant infor-
mation—that is, the left-wing
Whose
opinion ?
Dear Sir,
I've just watched Christo-
pher Parker make Imperial
College look ridiculous by
associating its name with the
reactionary and stupid views
he put forward on the BBC's
' Man Alive'. This surely
brings up the whole question
of who is to represent IC in
any matter of external com-
munications. Perhaps the
President would care to ex-
plain his choice (if it was his
choice) of Mr. Parker at the
next Union meeting. This
would seem to me exception-
ally relevant at the present
time in the light of the com-
ing visit of the Government's
Select Committee of Student
Affairs, and their meeting a
wide spectrum of College
opinion. How wide? Who de-
cides? Whose opinion?
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lafferty.
student ' protesters'.
The fault for this lies both
with the select committee
itself and with the authori-
ties of the Universities con-
cerned. In certain cases, e.g.
the London School of Eco-
nomics the Select Committee
has asked to see the President
of the Union, the Vice-Presi-
dent, the President of the
Athletic Union, etc., but un-
der pressure it agreed to meet
elected Union delegates. In
other cases, e.g. Imperial
College, the Select Commit-
te has asked the Principal to
allow them to meet half a
dozen students representing a
fair cross-section of student
opinion. Once again the same
handful of Union bureaucrats
have been selected. This does
not allow the student left a
chance to explain itself neith-
er is the Committee meeting
a fair cross-section of stud-
ent opinion.
It must be pointed out that
written evidence can be sub-
mitted by any student; this,
however, is no substitute for
a personal confrontation
where one can make relevant
and instructive comments as
the Select Committee, I am
sure, wishes.
The only way that it is
possible for the select Com-
mittee to meet a broad spec-
trum of student opinion is by
a completely open question
and answer session. If it is
felt that this would be un-
manageable or an inadequate
way for the Select Committee
to ask its ' prepared' ques-
tions and it is felt best to
resort to small personal inter-
view sessions, then, in order
for the Select Committee to
achieve the purpose for which
it was constructed, surely it
must be allowed to meet
members of the student left.
Or else, as we saw at the Uni-
versity of Essex, the student
left will find it necessary to
take their views to the Stand-
ing Committee.
Yours faithfully,
C. P. Thunhurst.
Overseas Students
Committee
Dear Sir,
Imperial College has a higher proportion of overseas
students than many other similar institutions. In this con-
nection with the new and still evolving Overseas Student Com-
mittee should serve a useful purpose and should be wel-
comed. I also welcome its recent promotion, I gather, to
become a sub-committee of the Union Welfare Committee,
and its recent effort to ensure, through a new constitution,
that its member be elected from the general body of overseas
students.
On the other hand I should like to suggest, while the
momentum of the Committee and its evolution is still gain-
ing, that it broadens and looks further in its aim than the
present one of catering for the welfare of overseas students,
and what it sounds like in the constitution, of pulling them,
like a separate species, into more active life in the college.
If we follow the apparent wish of the brains behind the
new constitution, that the committee be one elected and thus
be longing to overseas students, surely its aims should be that
furthering their interests (welfare being one of these), of
bringing out their contributions to the life of the College
(it is more often outsiders who ' encourage participation'
to quote the original wording), and of promoting an inter-
national atmosphere among all students (rather than encour-
age British-overseas social contact).
These suggested changes are much more than a matter of
a difference in wordings. They are necessary in order that
the Committee can give a more genuine benefit to the
overseas students well as to the whole student life. They
are also necessary in order that the committee can attract
support. Unless in the general meetings where its members
are elected, there are sufficient controversial issues (or
probably unless there are sufficient entertainments of what-
ever kind, as at the Constituent College Union meetings),
it seems unlikely that more than the quorum of 80 overseas
students would attend, just to elect a committee that only
looks after their welfare and, following again the wordings
of the Constitution, to assist them in their problems. The
recent general meeting attracted only 20 students.

Collar and tie rule
Dear Sir,
A rule requiring jacket,
collar and tie to be worn in
Beit Upper Refectory has
recently been enforced. No
other refectory in College has
this rule; not even the South
Side staff refectory.
The College seems to want
conformity to an old-fashion-
ed idea of respectability, a
policy more appropriate to a
finishing school than to a
University.
Why have this rule ? The
only reason can be to keep
students out, so that it be-
comes effectively the Beit
staff refectory. If so, this is
another reason why the rule
should be strongly opposed.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. B. Achwayshilaf, M .
G. Green, G. P. Gopal, A .
Mutalib, G. Thompson, D.
Pearce, B. Penny, (PGs,

Dear Sir,
Would you like to be sud-
denly handed a bill for elec-
tricity which was supposed
to be free ?
Residents in Bernard Sun-
ley House were told last term
that due to insufficient heat-
ing arrangements they would
use their own electric fires
plugged into the " free " wall
sockets.
Five weeks later they were
told that they had no right to
use them and from then on
they would receive a bill for
all electricity used. This term
they received a bill for the
whole term—charged at the
•maximum rate of 3d. per
unit.
Alright, so they were only
paying for what they used,
but are they ? Inquiries into
how the totals were arrived
at are met with the sharp
comment that " they've got to
paid, no arguments". The bill
for one single room came to
over £8! That is 9 units a
day, seven days a week, yet
the person in question spends
more of his time out of the
room.
The residents have been
told that the house is running
into financial difficulties. It
is obvious that they are pay-
ing for other people's mis-
takes.
Somebody has also thought
out that the more of us there
are, the more we pay; so
when somebody returned to
his room last week he found
another bed and a wardrobe
crammed into it. Unluckily
there was no room at all for
a second writing desk—so the
new resident has to do with-
out.
It appears that this is the
first of many ' enlargements '
that will be made, though de-
tails are, as usual, hard to
come by until everything has
happened.
The " House Committee "
set up to safeguard our in-
terests is taken no notice of
at all. Everything they want
is agreed to at meetings, yet
nothing done after.
We keep being told the
house is new, difficult to or-
ganise, but do we hear any
complaints from Linstead
Hall?
Yours,
John Giles.
DOUBLE
PUNISHMENT
We have received a num-
ber of letters on the subject
of double punishment but
are unable to publish them
because of lack of space.
However we hope to publish
letters on this topic in the
next FELIX. A l l letters for
publication should be brief,
preferably under 300 words.
You have enough
to worry about. So we don't
ask for bank charges.
The biggest cloud on the horizon
for a student (apart from
examinations) is money. A grant
is difficult to live on.
So Lloyds Bank doesn't ask for
bank charges on student
accounts, provided
the account is
always in credit.
We can also give free advice
on how to manage your
financial affairs.
Why not talk to the Manager
of your nearest branch of
Lloyds Bank? He'd be delighted
to see you.

helps you to plan.
