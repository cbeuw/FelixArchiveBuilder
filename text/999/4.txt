The Wordly Wise
Last weekend, the Regional Finals of the Times Crossword Championship took
place in Knightsbridge. Simon Shaw tapped into some of the cerebral activity.
Last Saturday, more than two
hundred seemingly ordinary
people convened at the Hyatt
Carlton Tower Hotel in
Knightsbridge. They were there
to take part in a competition, the
Times Crossword Championship.
There was a buzz of childish
excitement in the makeshift foyer
outside the hotel's Ballroom
West as introductions took place.
Sizing up of the opposition was
masked by refined English smiles
and casual nodding of heads.
Cryptic Crosswords test the
mind in much the same way as
any enigma does. They require
simultaneous systematic and
lateral thinking.
I watched and listened with
interest as the puzzlers warmed
up their cerebra.
"I do them in numerical order.
It reduces the risk of missing a
clue."
"I do them in a chain so that I
have interlinking letters."
Eavesdropping on their
conversations, you might have
thought they were potty. Some
were.
I had arrived early and took
the opportunity to walk round the room in which
the competitors were to solve their crosswords. It
looked a lot like an exam room - four crossword
grids were laid out on each table. The
competitors were to be given half an hour to
solve each crossword.

the clock but
The Hyatt's Ballroom. Scene of the enigmatic interrogation
man ambled out of the Ballroom wearing a navy
blue Oriel College blazer and a now familiar
crossword competition tie. He turned out to be
John Grant, former Deputy Editor of The Times
and now, in retirement, their Crossword Editor. I
inquired about the
of the
ords. He was
cagey. Compiling is a
an cottage industry and
incorrect solution meant might hOVC UlOUght they crossword setters are
no score traditionally secretive.
Before the start I was Were pOtty. Some Were. What he could tell me
introduced to organiser, was that The Times has a
Michael Rich. It is the 25th year and the 24th team of some ten compilers, two of whom were
event, he told me. This year's Championship is
sponsored by Knockando, manufacturers of fine
Scotch whisky. Today's event was part of the
regional finals for which qualifiers had to have
solved two Times crosswords. The second
qualifying puzzle was an "eliminator" which was
necessary to reduce the large number of entries
arising from the first qualifier. The Glasgow
regional final has already taken place. The other
regional finals will be held in Leeds,
Birmingham and Bristol, later this year. The
national finals, for which the event returns to
London, are held in September.
As I was talking to Mr Rich, a jolly-looking
responsible for this competition's crosswords.
It was time for the competition to begin. Mr
Rich welcomed everyone and his wisecracks
went some way to iron out
the frowns on the nervous
faces. He introduced John
Grant as the man who
would settle any disputes
arising from the crossword
clues. Mr Grant cordially
invited anyone who had a
quandary with a clue to
discuss it with him in the tearoom but warned
them jovially "It is unlikely I will share your
view.
"Three, two, one...go". The
solvers turned over their clue
sheets and began reading. About
ten minutes later the first arms
were being raised, each one
signifying the completion of a
grid. The triumphant few swiftly
retired to the tearoom where they
excitedly discussed the first
crossword. I began to hear
rumours of a misprint in one of
the clues. Surely not. John Grant
sat in a corner coolly meditating
behind a pile of scruffy reference
books - Collins and Chambers
Dictionaries, the Oxford
Dictionary of Quotations, the
Collins Dictionary of the Bible
and Brewer's Twentieth Century
Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.
The rumour proved to be with
foundation: an anagram clue had
the word 'got' in place of 'get':
7. We got confused with odd
double entendre, for example
(3-5)
However, being an anagram
clue, (TWO-EDGED) there was
little reason for it having
seriously put any solver off. Its relevance was
refuted by a, nevertheless, quietly perturbed John
Grant. The general consensus was that the first
crossword had been pretty easy. I had been told
as much and was anxious to see how the now
relaxed solvers would tackle the second one. The
competitors shuffled back into the exam room.
This time, the first person to solve the
crossword had taken noticeably longer. However,
in recognition of its difficulty he had praise for
its compiler:
"Real artistry," he declared.
A more harassed solver looked visibly shaken
by the more difficult second puzzle.
"When one's not under pressure, one can do it
in ten minutes," he insisted; this one had taken
him 17 minutes.
An honest solver said simply: "That was a
difficult puzzle."
All competitors
looked likely winners
on Fifteen to One.
Some were.
It was 5 across which
provoked most of the
debate:
5. Fly? One may have to
down under (6)
The answer was
D O C T O R but its meaning as a type of angler's
fly was not widely known even in these circles.
