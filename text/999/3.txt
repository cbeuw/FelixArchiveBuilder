Art Exhibition Mind Over Matter
A visitor to the ante room becomes transfixed
An art exhibition containing work by students and staff of Imperial College
opened this week.
The exhibition, which is in the Ante Room of the Sherfield Building,
opened on Wednesday. It will run until 17th June and entrance is free.
Many of the works are for sale, at prices negotiable with the artists.
UCL Team Uncover
Ancient European
BY LYNN BRAVEY
500,000 year old human remains
have been unearthed by a team led
by Dr Mark Roberts of University
College London.
A piece of left tibia (shin bone)
was discovered 100 feet below
ground amongst animal bones in a
gravel pit in Boxgrove, Sussex.
Although the piece of bone is only
around 5in long, scientists have
managed to construct a picture of
the size and build of the man. The
early human has been estimated as
being 6ft 3in tall and probably
weighed more than 13 stone.
Boxgrove Man has been hailed
as the earliest European and the
finding destroys theories that
Neanderthal Man was the ancestor
of modern man. The ancient human
was taller, stood more upright and
had a bigger brain than Neanderthal
Man, who stood no more than 5ft
7in and had a broad stature. It is
now thought that Neanderthal Man
was an evolutionary dead-end.
Dr Geoffrey Wainwright, chief
archaeologist for English Heritage,
said Boxgrove Man "was surround-
ed by stone tools and the remains of
animals, ranging in size from elephant
and rhino to mink and voles." The
early water voles have provided
vital dating evidence as they had
roots on their molar teeth which
were absent in later breeds. This
along with oxygen-isotope and
paleomagnetic techniques have pro-
vided the necessary information for
reliably dating the specimen.
The remains have caused inter-
national interest among scientists
who have long suspected that the
first European man predated previ-
ous finds. The discovery is likely to
be classified as "archaic Homo
sapiens" and is millions of years
later than the earliest human ances-
tors, Australopithecus, who lived
between 1 and 3.75 million years
ago, and Homo erectus who flour-
ished from 1.8 million years ago.
Both of these ancestors have been
found in Africa, only Homo sapiens
is known to have entered Europe.

Questions which have puzzled
philosophers for thousands of years
may soon be answered at a seminar
to be held at Imperial College on
26th May.
Futurists and science fiction
writers have dreamed of the day
when computers and machines have
the ability to make decisions and
think on their own. The advent of
neural networks and artificially
intelligent machines are making
these dreams reality.
One of the guest speakers at the
seminar, Igor Aleksander, Professor
of Neural Systems Engineering at
Imperial College, says machines are
now being developed which can
think, hold their own point of view
and even dream. The potential for
these systems is enormous, with
possible applications in medicine,
communication and security.
Three other distinguished scien-
tist, Prof Jean-Marie Lehn, Prof
Lord Porter and Prof Robert May
FRS, will also be offering their
views on the future of scientific
gains with the union of biological
sciences and physical sciences.
The seminar, Is Life Becoming
Hard, will be held in the Clore
Lecture Theatre, Huxley Building,
at 2pm next Thursday.
Princess Royal to
visit IC
BY LYNN BRAVEY
HRH The Princess Royal will offi-
cially open a new parallel computing
centre at Imperial College next
Tuesday.
The Imperial College/Fujitsu
European Parallel Research Centre
will support a programme of collab-
orative research in Europe into par-
allel software technology and a
wide spectrum of applications.
Fujitsu has donated an AP1000 par-
allel machine to Imperial College to
provide the initial computational
resource for the Centre. Many acad-
emic departments, including
Aeronautics, Chemistry and
Geology, will use the machine to
tackle problems which cannot be
solved by conventional machines.
An estimated Â£60,000 has been
spent on giving the foyer of the
Huxley Building a face-lift for the
royal visit.
Minibus Safety
BY MIKE INGRAM
Union minibuses may be forced to
have seatbelts fitted if predicted
legislation on minibus safety goes
ahead.
This comes after a minibus crash
this week in which two 8-year old
Cub Scouts and the 42 year old dri-
ver died and over 30 people were
injured. The crash happened in
heavy rain on the A59, when a
minibus carrying the Cub Scouts
collided with a coach carrying
teenage Army Cadets.
The deaths have brought renewed
calls for seatbelts to become com-
pulsory in minibuses. As a result, the
Government has pledged to make
fitting seatbelts to new minibuses
compulsory. There have also been
predictions that the law may force
seatbelts to be fitted in all minibuses.
If this became law, the Union would
have to refit all of its current fleet of
minibuses, which are mostly of the
'crew' type where seats run along
the sides of the minibus.
Deputy President (Finance &
Services) David Goddard said that
the Union have been "looking,
along with the Safety Department,
at actually converting those [the
crew-type buses] to front facing
seats with seatbelts." The discus-
sion came after a Union-owned
minibus was written off in an acci-
dent last summer. The new minibus
being bought by the Union will be
equipped with seatbelts.
