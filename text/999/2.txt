Imperial Airways BMA Slams CVCP
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Students form Imperial College will
be attempting to break a world
record on Saturday.
A team from the Aeronautics
Department are hoping to set the
record for the longest distance
flown by a paper aeroplane. The
team will be one of 16 competing
for the record at Duxford Open Air
Museum, near Cambridge. The
event is being organised by the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund and
is receiving coverage by the national
media including B B C Television's
'Record Breakers'.
It is also hoped that the world
record for the largest paper aero-
plane to fly 50ft will be set. The
favourites to do this are the team
from British Petroleum, whose
plane has a 32ft wing-span and has
already flown over 50ft in tests.
Sean Trinner, the event organiser,
said that the design weighed 171bs
and had taken "700 man hours, 300
square metres of paper and 60 tubes
of U H U glue." The record is cur-
rently held by NASA with a plane
of wing-span 30'/2ft.
Mr Trinner estimated that the
event would raise around £10,000
for the charity.
Apology
Felix would like to apologise to
James Handley, IC Radio Station
Manager, for misquoting him in
issue 997.
The story related to an incident
involving Union President Andrew
Wensley which took place in IC
Radio on Tuesday 3rd May. We
accept that the quote describing his
state was taken out of the context in
which it was intended. Mr Handley
referred only to the way Mr Wensley
looked and not his actual state.
We would also like to apologise
to Mr Wensley for portraying him
in this way.

The British Medical Association
( B M A ) has condemned medical
schools for banning students who are
carriers of Hepatitis B.
The ban came into force after new
guidelines were issued last month by
the Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals (CVCP). The guide-
lines call for universities to screen all
applicants for medical and dental
courses for Hepatitis B. Any student
found to be infectious and carrying
the virus should be excluded from the
courses, given advice on the career
implications and transferred to other
courses. St Mary's Hospital Medical
School operates its admissions proce-
dure in line with the guidelines. The
official policy is stated in the new
prospectus under the Health Section.
The Hepatitis B virus, like the
AIDS virus, is present in the blood
and body fluids of infected people. It
can be spread sexually, by sharing
needles, or by blood to blood contact.
People infected may have no symp-
toms, but many can develop serious
liver disease, causing their death.
Doctors who are infected cannot per-
form surgery because of the risk of
infecting a patient, but are unlikely to
be banned from other forms of non-
invasive medicine.
The CVCP said: "Medical schools
are mindful of their overriding duty
of care to the public with whom med-
ical students come into close contact
at an early stage of their studies...
medical and dental students have an
ethical duty to protect patients."
The B M A has labelled the mea-
sures as "an alarmist and dogmatic
approach to a problem which is well
enough researched to be dealt with by
reasonable management. It represents
an overzealous approach by those
responsible for protecting the public
and could prove difficult to defend
legally."
The Association expressed con-
cern at discrimination against
potential students without consider-
ation of their individual situations.
It said that it is perfectly possible
for carriers of Hepatitis B to study
for a degree in medicine, although it
accepted that they might have to be
barred from certain areas of medical
practice.
