The Guilds party was the f i r s t to
set off f o r Putney on ilorphy Day.
They marohed down E x h i b i t i o n Road to
South Kensington Station. The R.C.S.
contingent seeing them pass the end of
Imperial Institute Road, realised that
there were about 100 people i n the party
Since any R.C.S. man i s equal to two
Guildsmen R.C.S. took a party of about
50 down to Putney.
They marohed down to Gloucester Road
Station where the President lead the
aasualt. The.ticket c o l l e c t o r wisely
stood to one side. A change of trains
at E a r l s Court Station lead to a rapla
deploying of forces; thus four people at
points along the platform confidently
c a l l i n g " A l l change please" resulted i n
an empty t r a i n going t o E a l i n g .
At Putney Bridge Station the party
passed through by saying "Tickets a t the
back" The l a s t member walked through
without saying anything. Thus.;:the. party
arrived a t the Boat"House i n great s p i r -
i t s , only to f i n d that Guilds had i n -
d u l g e d i n a dastardly attack on Jez-
-ebel. The wrath of the party oould
not be oontained and the R.C.S. oonting-
-ent was lead rapidly along the tow-
path 30 that i t s members oould "get a t "
Guilds.
This year the President of R.C.S.
had challenged the President of Guilds
to a duel:-
Custard pies at three f e e t .
This took place with a l l due ceremony
but not before the Guilds president
had been forced to apologise f o r the
disgusting attaok on Jezebel.
After the Presidents duel, which
l i k e the main contest resulted i n a most
honorable draw, the two p a r t i e s "had at"
one another. I t hau been decided that
this year Mascots should not be involved
i n the battle so they were placed to 'one
side.. I t must be noted that during the
battle the President of Guilds saw that
they migat be( damaged so he removed both
mascots to a safe place.
At the beginning of the contest
Guilds rushed madly at R.C.S., but were
speedily repelled by only a few of the
3 cwt. of rotten apple3 that.R.C.S.
possessed. R.C.S. then followed up
t h i s i n i t i a l rout by chasing tjje Guilds-
-men and indulging in-some magnificent
hand to hand fighingv In t h i s ^ the"
Vice President of Guilds was captured
and despite his repeated bellows of
"Guilds!: Guilds:! " none of h i s men \1)
had s u f f i c i e n t courage to attempt a res-
T H E N E W S P A P E R O F
I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E
-cue, so that the Vice Presidents trous-
-ers were soon f l y i n g with several other
Guildsmen's trousers from the trees.
I t must be noted that the Vice President
of Guilds was the only member of either
executive to loose h i s trousers.
The struggle f o r power waxed to and
f r o along the tow-path, attaok followed
attack followed counter attack and Guilds,
despite t h e i r v a s t l y superior numbers,
could maxe no impression on the R.C.S.
ranks. The battle raged.on and on;
Guilds had used up t h e i r apples, oiieir
f l o u r bags, and t h e i r tomatoes,K.Co.
too hid run out of ammunition; i t was
no* a question of tremenuoua hand to
hand f i g h t i n g . I t was obvious .that
Guilds would never daunt the i < . C o . s p i r -
i t , yet R.C.S. could never quite gain
the upper hand. A short truce and a
conference between Presidents only res-
u l t e d i n f i e r c e r attacks, but then the
Presidents decided that a draw was a
f a i r r e s u l t so the mascots were restored,
Brough found h i s trousers and the two
colleges lined the banks to watch the
races.
The colleges decided that since the
r e s u l t was a draw, neither President had
won, so each College casually tossed i t s
own President into the Thames.
Sie f i n a l memory of the day was the
amazing sight of 150 R.C.S. and Guildsmen
playing Ring 0-Ring of Roses round two"
London Transport buses and four cars on
Putney Bridge a f i t t i n g end t o a
tremendous afternoon of sport.
