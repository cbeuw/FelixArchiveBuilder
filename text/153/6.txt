To swimming shadows on water, the
swinging sax of Jimmie Guiffre, dawns a
summer1
s day of jazz. The Newport Jazz
F e s t i v a l on Rhode Island. Ships and s a i l s
out i n the roads; and faces, gone extatio
faces, the s u n - l i t laughing faces of the
fans, the intent twisted faces of the jazz
men. At last here i s the answer to that
question which bugs a l l friends of jazz:
What i s Jazz? Well here i s the answer,
the whole gamut of jazz emotion from A to
Z, from what has come to be known as rock
'n' r o l l to gongs and c e l l o s , Konk and
Kahalia, Chico and Satch i n the carefree
cool context of an American summer's day.
P i c t o r i a l l y this thing i s a dream,
oontinual close ups of the performers that
r e a l l y helps the mood. The camera d i v i n g
down on a close hauled ocean yacht to a
drum-break. Candid "takes" of the audience
throwing their emotions; right i n your eye.
Pieces of picture magics— a duet of c e l l o
player and cigarette smoke, the orange of
sunset, black gulls againsf the twilight
blue of the sea,the f l a s h of racing water,
j i v e r 3 , drunks, a woman with eyes as blue
as glass.
Unexpected a l l the time, this takes
you i n and out and round about the Newport
jazz soene; on stage, back stage, out f r o n t ,
faces w i l l take up the scene, t e l l you the
story of their owners and then f l a s h you
into the middle of a funky solo. Starting
gay, giving you the exp ctancy of preparation
some r e a l gems of l o c a l reaction to the
annual invasion, then the cool, f a r out,
on the edge, leading to the great c l i m a t i c
of drea*ay intoxicated i d e n t i f i c a t i o n with
jazz - the abstract. Then the cool o f f ,
the saturation, the surrender, the Lord's
Prayer by Mahalia Jackson*!
-crazy.

pective. The background (Nottingham),
the incident, and the speech are made

but hope that i t might pierce the def-
ensive thick skin of those fashionable
turnip heads who laugh i n a l l the wrong-
places and snigger when something part-
i c u l a r l y outspoken i s said, who even
while l i n i n g the pockets of the s o c i a l
r e a l i s t w r i t e r s must have broken their
hearts.
There has been need f o r a r e a l l y
accurate p i c t u r e ever sinoe "Look Back
in Anger", started the fashion f o r
"working class end i t s attendant trap-
pings of rather quaint vulgarity, T.V.
trauma, noble savage and very earthy."
Outsider type "angries" such as Colin
Wilson enhanoed t h i s p i c t u r e of the
brute masses as a contrasting background
to the Wilson brand of superman, who
l i k e a l l super-men i s modelled on h i s
inventor. In t h i s f i l m Wilson's picture
of an almost'inhuman "other h a l f " r e b e l -
l i n g against the established order to
no great purpose.
"I want something b e t t e r than mum
an' dad got. Not that 'am blaming them
they hadn't a chance, they've been snu-
bbed by the bloody gaffers an' now the-
y're just dead from the neck up. Well
not t h i s boy". This seems more or l e s s
orthodox anti-hero of the f i f t i e s , but
unlike the Amis, Braine, Osbourne types
Arthur i s not an educational misfit
but jusi a plain/sxjrkihg l a d .
although he engages i n sniping at the
enemy i n true "Lucky Jim" t r a d i t i o n :
he voted communist at the l a s t election
in his dad's name, i t seems more f o r
the laugh than anything else.
Arthur i s a tough sensitive lathe
hand "knocking o f f a piece of married
stuff ". L i f e hangs together between
Saturday nights and as long as you dent
let the bar-star da grind you down, ever—
ythings great. Then Brenda the married
piece becomes pregnant and slowly end
beautifully the awareness of other
peoples feelings and his responsibility
te them emerges. The situations never
'Hem pretentious, always oonvincing,
especially a wonderful not i n the. .
l e a s t , "like the films" love scene.
I found t h i s a cheering piece. I t
said to me that i t i s possible to
humanise oneself against the enemy
of machine cemformism, and that beerand
women p a l l i a t i v e s are not the only things
that make l i f e tolerable, but things
don't end on a milk and r03es happy end-
ing.
"Do you want a new house ducks?"
says Arthur.
"Yes with a bathroom and everything".
"I wonldnt mind an old one - you know
we used to ro;ja a l l over these f i e l d s
when we were kids . Blackberryin' -
soon there wont be a blade of grass
anyvkero".
He picks up a 3tone and throws i t at
one of the new houses :-
"What d i d you do that for? One of them
houses might be f o r us "
"Oh I don't know - just f e l t l i k e rb -
an' - I ' l l throw a l o t mere before am
done an' a l l .

by I . L. Gibson.
Stravinsky's vocal works are so
seldom performed i n this country that
an oppurtunity of seeing two i n one
go should.not be missed. "Oedipus Rex"
and "The Nightingale" are being given
as a double b i l l at Sadler's Wells,
one further performance being scheduled
for iicveiaber 30th.
Although Stravinsky i s not every-
one1
s oup of tea, i f one approaches the
.evening with an unbiased mind and ear,
I am sure these (wo works w i l l . n o t
f a i l to impress. "The Nightingale" i s
the e a r l i e r and s l i g h t e r pieoe and i n
some ways may be considered rather
naive i n comparison with the majesty
and drama of "Oedipus Rex". S t r i c t l y
t h i s l a s t i s not an opera, but an
opera—oratorio, and i s sung i n L a t i n
by a chorus and s i x s o l o i s t s . A narr-
ator eases the job of interpretation,
but he i s not allowed to intrude into
the stage drama, the effect of which
1B considerably heightened by the
very fine decor. The whole of the cast,
including the chorus, appear i n sym-
b o l i c masks, while the splendid costumes
give the production a regal a i r .
Stravinsky's music and t h i s imagi-
native stage presentation combine to
give the performance as a whole tre-
mendous impact, and as the tragedy draws
to a close one i s nearly overpowered by
the force of the music.
The B a l l e t Season opens at Covent
Garden on December 14th. with"Cinderella".
Fohteyn and Soames w i l l be f l y i n g from
New York to appear on t h i s opening night,
but l a t e r i n the season Beriosova,

"Swan Lake^. returns to the reper-
tory early i n the New Year, Nerina

January 11th. "Coppelia", "Pineapple
P o l l " and a new b a l l e t , "The I n v i -
t a t i o n " , are among the other works
being performed during the Christmas
