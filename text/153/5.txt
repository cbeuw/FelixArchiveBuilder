Sear S i r ,
In T i e r of the n a t i o n a l shortage
of trained technologists, i t i s sur-
p r i s i n g that large areas of South
Kensington have not yet been taken
over by Imperial College. We suggest
that a l l the nearby buildings of
importance be adapted f o r College use.
The most immediate requirement
i s the V i c t o r i a and Albert Museum,
whioh i s already admirably furnished
f o r use as a Hostel. There are several
large rooms suitable f o r parties, con-
taining huge four-poster beds on which
a l l those unable to f i n d t h e i r way home
may be accommodated.
The Natural History Museum would
provide an unending series of stuffed
masoots to replace ours, whenever i t (or
he) has been stolen by another College.
What i s more, Guildsmen would be able to
f i n d congenial h o s t e l accommodation i n
the Anthropoid section.
No longer need the Miners go down
to Cornwall to do t h e i r digging. They
should be given the task of extending
the South Kensington Station tunnel to
surround the College, thereby preventing
student commuters from getting wet i n
the morning.
The Physics Department w i l l soon
be too large f o r the new block, and w i l l
have to move into the Albert H a l l . The
auditorium i t s e l f w i l l suggest some fas-
cinating problems of acoustical research,
and the outer corridor seems ready-made
for the i n s t a l l a t i o n of a synchrotron.
F i n a l l y , Hyde Park should be
closed to outsiders and made into a
Garden of Rest, where r e t i r e d h o s t e l
wardens and Trophy o f f i c e r s can
soothe t h e i r shattered nerves and
watch the "Phoenix" B a l l a s t i c M i s s i l e ,
formerly known as the A l b e r t Memorial,
being prepared f o r i t s f i n a l launching
against King's.
Imperially yours,
Jon Bareford,
Ian Guy.
Dear S i r ,
It i s very easy to write destructive
c r i t i c i s m of you and your newspaper so I
am therefore r e f r a i n i n g from doing so
and am instead congratulating you on
the 152nd,edition,your f i r s t as editor-
a very good f i r s t t r y . I wanted to com-
pare i t with the previous issue,which, I
was taught at school,should have been No.
151,dated 28th.October 1960. But when I
found F e l i x of that date,I found a celeb-
ratory issue numbered 150.
What has happened to 151? This i s
<the Mystery of the Year - Nay,the Decade.
Then a possible answer ocoured to
me. Have you,sir,become l i k e the painter
who,finding that he had l i t t l e paint l e f t
worked f a s t e r so that he would f i n i s h
before the paint ran out? But no.152was
your f i r s t e d i t i o n . Surely you're not
devoid of ideas so soon and ready t o quit
your position?
Or are you working backward to Christ-
mas and p r i n t i n g No. 151 i n a fortnight's
time? T h l " wouldn't be a bad idea because
on Dec.9th.the Christmas edition of F e l i x
w i l l be published,it would be No.150 and
you oould have another celebratory issue.
And what of 1961? Are we turning our
Decks on the future? W i l l progress stop
In t h i s college? I am sure i t w i l l not
happen,but t h i s i s a l o g i c a l r e s u l t of
tko great'mystery. I hope you t r y and
solve it,and I wish you luck i n your
hunt f o r No. 151.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
B. W.Treves.

I t was my intention when I
started these comments, to merely
touch upon various issues rather than
to argue vehemently f o r a p a r t i c u l a r
side of each case. However, now that
a f o r t n i g h t l y a r t i c l e has become necess
ary to argue each case more f u l l y
though unfortunately this w i l l mean
that fewer subjedts may be mentioned.
Mr. "Fotheringham" c r i t i s e d my
comments of the l a s t issue regarding the
choice of dates and the number of Union
meetings f o r t h i s term. He s a i d , f o r
instance,"...it i s not possible to
decide the dates of Union meetings
before the beginning of terra as these
are arranged i n conjunction with the
General Studies Board". This i s
precisely my point - i n reverse! In
f a c t , the following happened. Last
julflp several societies started arranging
their programme f o r this term. The more
conscientious found out i n advance that
the General Studies Progra>»se had
provision f o r Union Meetings i n October
25th and December 8th. This programme
was i n fact published and d i s t r i b u t e d
during the f i r s t week of term. I t was
then decided not to hold the Union
Meetings pn these two days but one
meeting on November 15th. The following
are reasons f o r c r i t i s i n g thi3 decision:-
1). Several College society meet
ings had to be cancelled because of this
decision.
By John.Cox.
2). The Agenda was c e r t a i n to be
overcrowded.
}). The f i r s t Union Meeting f o r the
Freshers would include the dullest item
of the year - the Accounts, thus possibly
making them less l i k e l y to come again.
if). Holding one meeting before
December made i t necessary to present
the Accounts before there had been enough
time to have the Accounts printed.
In the l i g h t of the above I f e e l
my c r i t i c i s m s were j u s t i f i e d .
My very good f r i e n d Dave Wilbraham
was t e l l i n g me the other day how much i t
annoys him to f i n d the T.V. i n the Union
Lounge. This happens every time there
i s a posh dinner i n the evening. I t seems
to me that the moat sensible place f o r
the T.V. set would be i n the Small Lounge
upstairs, I wonder what Mr "Fotheringham"
thinks!
One last snippet, I see that up t i l l
now (nov.19th) neither the decisions nor
the minutes of Council meetings have been
posted on the Council notice-board this
term. Since Council have been instructed
by-two Union meetings to use this means
of publishing their decisions, i t does
seem a l i t t l e high-handed f o r the Union
meeting's decision to be ignored l i k e
t h i s .

by U.T.L. Fotheringham,
I am g r a t i f i e d to see that Mr. Cox.
i s now going to present arguments on
the topics he raises; t h i s i s i n f i n i t e l y
preferable to baldly stating one side
of a controversial question.
My information regarding the dates
of Union Meetings was obtained from
the President of the Union. In fact
the date of the Union, fcieeting was not
decided u n t i l the beginning of t h i s
term, presumably Mr. H i l l thought that
October 25th was too early i n the term.
for Freshers to be "able to decide on a.
matter so important aa a change i n Union
Constitution. I t does, however, seem
i l l o g i c a l to present the Accounts before
printed copies were available; the
w
r e s h e r s were not alone i n t h e i r boreaom.
This writer (not unnaturally) thinks
that the Upper Lounge would be the most
sensible place f o r the T e l e v i s i o n set.
The reading room could then be used f o r
i t s correct purpose, and we would be

causes equal annoyance to loungers and

to commend the House Committee on t h e i r
choice of set; the new one i s a great
improvement on the previous decrepit
goggle-box.
Once agian Mr. Cox i s being vague.
Which set of Council minutes i s lie
awaiting with such eager anticipation?
I t i s only 9 days since the last Council
Meeting took place and I am sure Mr. Cox
cannot "expect these to be-printed yet.
The l i s t of decisions taken at the Emerg-
ency Council Meeting has already been on
the Board, and no minutes s h a l l be
published. The only, minutes missing
are those of J o i n t Council l a s t year,
