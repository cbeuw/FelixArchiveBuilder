In ih« runner of this veer tha
f i r s t wnaao-only owpsrUtion l e f t 1.0.
to visit the snailisland of ST.KITTS
in the Leeward Islands, the party
consisting of Miss Anne Phillips
and Hiss Shelagh Hooking. The alms
of the expedition were to work on
the sugar oaae pests, oolleot specimens
and make a survey of the fauna for the
Natural History Museum, whose last
records for the island are 40 years
old. St. Kitts i s predominantly
covered In sugar cane, but a ohaim of
volcanoes stretch down the centre of
the island, and these are oovared i n
tropical rain forest. A sand spit l a
found in the S.E. whioh i s much dryer
than the rest of the island, ao a
number of ecological habitats axe
found within a small area of
70 so. miles.The easiest way to
travel round the island was by
donkey, whioh was found to be a
rather hazardous method for the
inexperienced. Work was interrupted
for 2 weeks by Hurricane "Donna"
whioh passed through the island
early i n September, but St.Kitts was
not h i t as badly as the neighbouring
island of Anguilla. The expedition
also visited Guadaloupe, Antigua
and Nevis, so some comparative studies
oould be made between the islands, and
had the interesting experience of
seeing the annual Antigua Carnival.
Steel bands, oalypso- rhythms, and the
wonderful hospitality and kindness of
the West Indian people, combined to
make an interesting, exciting, but
beneficial trip.
Two zoologists spent eight >«is in
Ghana. They had two main aims. First,
to study the physical conditions in the
holds of the ships on which they trav-
-elled, and their effects on the insect
pests in the holds, especially those
pests associated with cocoa.
The other objeot of the expedition
was to make a oollection of the beetles
in the Forest•Reserve near Kumasi where
most of the time in Ghana was spent.
In addition, photographs were taken of
a l l forms of insect l i f e . While in
Ghana, one week was also spent at
Zuarungu, near the northern border of
the country.
While i t rains i n Britain, the sun
shines in Iceland; and the Central
Ioeland Expedition was blessed with
the finest Icelandic summer in 33 years.
During the six weeks spent in the
mountains there was rain on five days.
The objects of the expedition were
botanical and glaciologioal; but the
nearest ioe-oap proved inaccessable
and the glaoiologioal work was
abandoned
The expedition was carried by
truck llOmiles into the wilds of the
central plateau, dumped and left t o i t s
own devices. But a few hardy tourists
were seen from time to time, wno were
invariably amused by "those s i x mad
Englishmen". Unfortunately the ghost
of a nearby oave, which they had a l l
come to see, never raised i t s head i n
the s i x weeks.
Iceland's famous volcano Hekla,
was climbed during an eighteen hour
walk. No more than a few small whisps
of steam greeted six tired men at the
summit.
Three days were spent in Reykjavik
on the way home — a real holiday for
the party.
