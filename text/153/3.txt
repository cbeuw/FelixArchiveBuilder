Few readers can have f a i l e d to not-
ice that cumbersome,ivory and orange, pai-
nted vehicle outside the Union. I t was
i n thi3 ex-'.i.l;. number that the expedit-
ion travelled to Persia,and back. This
journey would have been considered dar-
ing ten year3 ago,but today i t i s an
everyday occurence,although i t s t i l l
retains some hazards.
In the East,night driving i s one
of these. An approaching vehicle w i l l
turn off a l l i t s lights. One's immed-
iate reaction i s to do likewise. Res-
u l t : — pitch darkness and a mad scramble
to f i n d the light switch. Both drivers
think alike and the road i s illuminated
by two set3 of oonverging headlights.
Completely dazzled,a c o l l i s i o n i s somen
how avoided,and another c r i s i s i s past.
The idea is,of Course,to alternate, the
road always being illuminated by one set
of lights.
Added to t h i s are the normal hazards
of hairpin bends on precipitous mountains,
stream gullies cutting the road away,
and beasts of burden blooking the road
around the next corner.
On the seventeenth day,we reached
Tehran,a c i t y of pleasant wide avenues
and a t r a f f i c problem bigger than Lon-
don' s. We spent the weekend there before
driving to our destination i n the Elburz
mountains i n the North, The mountain peo-
ple appear to be of a different race,
since their f a o i a l characteristics are
more rugged and their clothing more prac-
t i c a l . Although Moslem,their womenfolk
are not veiled,and they wear short s k i r t s
over voluminous trousers, The young c h i l -
dren are carried i n a shawl used as a pap-
oose and the f i r s t impression i s , i n f a c t ,
of an Indian squaw.
The country they l i v e i n i s very d i f -
ferent from the a r i d plains of central
Iran,since the mountains are i n the r a i n
b e l t of the Caspian Sea and support dec-
iduous forest up to a height of 16,000 f t .
Our work was carried out i n the higher
f o r e s t regions and a trek was made to the
glaoier below the summit of Takht-e-Sul-
aiman,the highest mountain of ofce group.

I.C. CARNIVAL. 1961.
As decided at the I.C. Union
meeting l a s t week, the proceeds of the
1961 Carnival w i l l be donated to the
Oxford Committee f o r Famine R e l i e f .
(OXFAM).
Last year the organisers
managed to raise £600. This year,
with the valuable experienee"which
'they have passed on to us, and with
your cooperation, i t should be possible
to raise £2500. As an incentive, i t
may interest you to know that a well
known g i r l s ' school i n the Midlands, of
only 6CO pupils, raised well over £500
for W.R.T. purely by their own e f f o r t s .
A a.iall body of interested
people ( s i x to be precise) met f o r the
f i r s t time on Tuesday l a s t week, but
AT LEAST s i x more are needed to form
the nucleus of. an e f f i c i e n t working
coostittee.
Our tentative programme i s as follows:-
House to house c o l l e c t i o n .
Fancy Dress Jive.
Competition to win a cor.
Mile of pennies.
Procession of Floats.
Fete.
Various Contests.
We hope that a Carnival
Magazine w i l l be produced.

If: you l i k e a good discussion, a
rambl* m Windsor Great Park and excellent
food, you are almost sure to enjoy a
-touchstone Weekend. They are held twice
a term at Silwood Bark, the Imperial
College F i e l d Station, where about BO bo
botanisis and biologists are admiraDly
situated to carry out their research.
oilwood House uaed'-o be a country
loansioh audits grounds s t i l l remind
one of one; i t i s less than a mile
from Windsor^ Great Park (South Eastern
Corner) wher* we almost invariably wander
on Sunday morning,, and within" easy walking
distance of Ascot Races. In the Great
Park there i s V i r g i n i a Water, a Canadian
Totem Pole (complete with faces of-a
Vhale, a beaver, an old man, a ''High Hat"
etc.) and a good view of Windsor Castle -
I've even seen the Duke of Edinburgh
playing polo watched by his wife!
The week-end starts after lunch on
Saturday when most of us p i l e into a coach
which gets to Silwood at about 3.30p.m.
(In fine weather a few of us cycle, -
i t ' s not an unpleasant route). Tea
and sandwiclies over, we move into the
lounge and.the Guest Speaker introduces
his subject - s i t t i n g on a soapbox, a
symbol of free speech suggested by S i r
Roderic H i l l who in' 1950 seems to have
started Touchstone Week-ends almost entirely
by himself - his was the idea of the name
of Touchstone ( i t i s a type of quartz
which mediaeval metalsmiths used to assay
the quality of a piece of expensive
metal),
After the main speaker has talked
for about an hour, we join i n and ask bin
questions andlater adjourn f o r a drink
at the Silwood House Bar before our. four
course meal followed by coffee,
At about 8.00p.m. MI reassemble i n three
groups and get down to the not too
seriou3 occupation of discussion; I have
never known any group succeed i n sticking
r l i i d l y to thepoint f o r long, usually we
seem to wander round i t but always
manage somehow to end up With a better
understanding of thetopic. The bar opens
again at about 9.30 and the -roups tend
to break up at about 11.00£ though some
occasionally go on u n t i l 1,00 or even
-later, (Some Americans once packed up
at 4.00a.m. and then went to play cards!)
Breakfast i n the morning i s scheduled
for 9.00a.m. I i;ave been served at 9,t5,
but one chap,, woken by the cleaners at
about midday, found he was a l i t t l e too
l a t e . Only once i n the ten tines I've
been has i t rained on S-unday, so now I
ist.OW Windsor lark pretty w e l l , but
-utyway every Sunday Paper i s available
andthere i s table tennis somewhere.
Richard Grossman attraoted about 1+0
to his meeting on U n i l a t e r a l Disarmament
( the t i t l e of themeeting was "The
Problem of Force").but most times there
are about 30 of whom about half are
postgrads, and about 2-5 women (including
wives); It has nikt been p r a c t i c a l yet
to arrange a joint meeting wish Bedford!
A few of us turn up regularly but most
people only manage to go once or twice.
The experience i s well worthwhile - not
from the "Cultural" aspect (that i s
questionable anyway) but ^oause i t ' s
damn jfood fun.
Oh, incidently, we are dished out
with name tabs on the bus going out
there, don't forget to take yours off
before returning, they somehow seem
to anuse people at Sunday evening dinner
i n the Union.
For those interested, there i a ample
opportunity to go to church before or
a f t e r breakfast or when you get back i h
the evening.
