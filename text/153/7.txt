were over 400 present - enough to
satisfy the new quorum requirements.
After reading the previous minutes,
three sets of accounts were presented:

help was needed. A l i v e l y discussion
ensued over which charity the funds
should go to. Mr. Alan Kunro pleaded f o r
a l o c a l charity, the old f o l k of London,
many of whom are l i v i n g i n great poverty.
Mr. Dan Elvyn Jones, as^rd the College

Both causes were deserving ones,but the
Union decided i n favour of the Oxford
Coamittee by a large majority.

exhibited at Union meetings. This s e n t i -
ment was echoed by several other members,

being t h e : j l o r i o u s symbol of our hope
