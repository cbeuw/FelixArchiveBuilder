The only defeat suffered by any of
our s i x teams i n league matches was when
our 5th team l o s t to our 4th team 7-3 i n
a very keenly fought matcn. The f i r s t team
have had a 6-4 win against Goldsmiths I
and a f i n e 9-1 v i c t o r y against N.C.L. I .
There was a shock i n store f o r the 3rd
team when they played the school of Pha-
rmacy, i n that the opposition had a former
Hungarian International playing f o r them.
Needless to say he won a l l h i s games , but
by beating a l l t h e i r other players our
team scraped home 6-4.

The Riding Club has had a. good
s t a r t t h i s year with considerable
support from the freshers. The em-
phasis this term has been placed on
r i d i n g at V.'imbledon, and a party of
about s i x people ride there every Wed-
nesday f o r i n s t r u c t i o n and hacking out
on the Common.
At the end of the Summer Vacation
four members of the Riding Club spent
a week r i d i n g and camping i n Cheshire
We t r i e d to keep the amount of camp-
ing gear to a minimum,but this extra
weight carried by the horses did res-
t r i c t the speed at which we could t r a -
v e l , and the distance which could be
covered each day before t i r i n g the
horses. However, unlike l a s t year
when the baggage was carried separat-
ely by a pony trap, we could be sure
of a tent over our heads when vie stop-
ped f o r the night! One morning dur-
ing the week we followed the Cheshire
Foxhounds f o r some splendid cub-
hunting. A f t e r the hunt we were i n -
v i t e d i n f o r "drinks" at a gentleman's
house, and t h i s was t y p i c a l of the
wonderful h o s p i t a l i t y which we receiv-
ed from farmers and natives throughout
the week: indeed there can be few
better ways of becoming completely re-
moved from the screaming cacophony and
bustle of a mechanical'age.
