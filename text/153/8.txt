As i f I didn't have enough to do!
The Business manager came up to me and
said that the Lram.Soc. didn't publicise
i t s e l f enough - what we needed was an a
a r t i c l e i n F e l i x and wasn't I just the
chap to write i t ? With a mixture of f l a t -
tery and cajolery he soon had me convin-
ced,so that l e f t only one problem,what
to write? Well,for what i t ' s worth,here
i t i s .
Most people seem to imagine that
presenting stage productions involves
nothing more than a few chummy rehearsals
and some set-to energetic wood-sawing and
hammering and a l l will.go well on the
night.. Hot a h i t of i t I Theatre i s b i g
business. Anyone who .loins the Dram. S o c
for relaxation i s mad.We're a l l mad any-
way. I see my friends getting less sane
as time goes by. Look at dear old —
now.he's been here s i x years and,well,
just look at him! What am I saying -
I can rememberwhen i t was possible to
stand on the stage with the rain dripr,
ping down one's neckand an i c y wind blow-
ing i n from where the main staircase
wasn't.
Where wa3 I? Ah,yes; " a l l w i l l go
right on the night". I t doesn't of course.
One of the atage Director's tasks i s to
ensure that we don't make the same mis-
takes twice, or, f a i l i n g that, to ensure
that there i s a decent Interval i n between.
Stage Managers come and go but the Stage
Director^goes on f o r ever, that's what
i t feels l i k e anyway. When there is'nt a
production i n rehearsal, there's main-
tenance or i n s t a l l a t i o n , or something.
Maintenance: i f a l i n e set f a i l s and a
couple of hundred-weight of scenery
crash to the f l o o r , the poor S . D . w i l l
have some explaining to do, especially
i f there was anyone underneath at the
time. Yet even i n the best-regulated
theatres the3e l i t t l e accidents do
iiappen. One becomes s u p e r s t i t i o u s — -
never whistle i n the dressing rooms and
don't walk under loaded l i n e sets.
I n s t a l l a t i o n now that's another
matter. Has i t ever occurred to you that
the Union building i s largely composed
of concrete? I f no.t, then you have never
t r i e d to screw anything to the walls.
Even a simple wiring job often leaves
in i t ' s wake a t r a i l of blue and blunted
d r i l l s and blue and blunted stage hands.
But these l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t i e s
vani3h into the background not oblivion,
the S.L. never forgets when a prod-
uction i s on the stocks. One minute one
is racking one's brain3 trying to f i n d
enough^work to keep the 3tage staff occ-
upied---- then the 3et plana arrive from
the designer and pandemonium i s l e t loose*
The Stage Janager divides his time between
driving on his carpenters and painters,
and explaining (or pleading ) to the
Producer, the designer1
(and the 3.D.)
that we haven't got enough wood, the set
i s impossible, the stage technical re-
hearsal times are inadequate.. .he Can.
go on »for hours!
And so i t goes on. The play:

Follovdjig the success of the Cup-team
the 1.0. 1st XV v i s i t e d Streatham on
Saturday. With more than a f a i r
share of the b a l l from the scrums the
I.C. backs were able to open up the
game. Whenever Streatham did get the
b a l l , p a r t i c u l a r l y from the line-outs
the I.C. wing forwards, Kehoe and
Connor, bottled up the half-backs very
effectively. As a whole the team
played very veil and deserved the 17-0
victory.
2nd ROUHD of SUTTgRJDGE CUP
Last year I.C. met the College of
Estate Managementship i n the Semi-
f i n a l of the University Rugby Cup.
'This year the two teams met i n the 2nd
round on November 16th.
Even before the game took place
I.C. knew that the danger lay i n the
O.E.M. stand-off half Mike Weston, the
England International. However on the
day the I.C. pack dominated the game
securing a monopoly of the b a l l from thb
scrums and line-outs. Two good pen-
a l t y goals by Bregazzi sent the team o f f
to a good start. A blind side break

her. This has been p a r t i c u l a r l y
noticeable i n the lower teams as the
records show. The Wanderer's XV (BA)
are now the only team who have won every
match. The main d i f f i c u l t y has not
been finding players but i n finding
matches f o r them to play i n . There
seems to be a very good team s p i r i t
throughout the club and the teams shou-
ld go on from strength to strength.
On November 12th the 1st XV, with
5 players from the University side,
just l o s t a very close game with the
London Welsh Druids. The score was
8-10. Both teams scored two t r i e s .
The Druids however scored under the
posts and converted. I.C. crossed
t h e i r opponents l i n e on three other
occasions, but the referee d i d hot
allow a t r y .
On Saturday l a s t the Ex 1st XV
did very w e l l to hold the London Welsh
Dragons to a 3-3 draw. I n heavy con-
ditions the play became very rough
with the Welsh "putting the boot i n "
to the extent that one player was sent
off but was afterwards recalled.
