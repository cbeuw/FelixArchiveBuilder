distance of the leaders, and this enab-
led I.C.A.C. oaptain John Cleator to

Since the last issue, the 1st
XI has been suffering rather mixed
fortunes. A cup rehearsal was played
against Kings last week and' in a very
even -game, we managed a very credit-
able 3-0 win mainly due to a sound
defence. However, against B a l l i o l
College from Oxford a week later,
we had 70£ of the play, but somehow
managed to lose 2-1 due in the. main-
to some magnificent goal-keeping by
their oaptain.
Yesterday, the 1st.

taining several county players, and
aftera very hard fast match oh a
rather bumpy pitch, lost by the only
goal of, the matoh-this i s probably
our best performance this year. With
Treves outstanding i n goal, the defenoe
played very solidly, to hold a fast
moving and olever forward line, and
in the closing stages we could count
ourselves very unluoky not nave
matohed an equaliser.
At last we have had a Saturday
on Jwhioh a l l four teams played, and
the results were most encouraging.
The 2nd. XI won oonvinoinglyby 4-0
against Royal Naval College, the 3rd.
XI beat London Hospital 6-0 (thanks
mainly to 4 goals by centre forward
Lawson) and the 4th. XI beat the
Bank of England 4-0. These results

Thomas' and K.C.H. have both unfortun-
ately suffered cancellation arid the
group who gathered at Hlghgate on the
26th Oct. f o r the Autumn Meeting found
the bedraggled course deemed unplay-

we fielded a f a i r l y sound side on Wed.
9th Nov. to tackle.the strong opposi-
tion of Kings and U.C. in-a triangulai
match at Stanmore.
Remarkably, the sun was beaming
down benevolently as I.C. strode to the
tee, but soon disappeared as one a f t e r

ardous tour of the wooded countryside.
Gorse bushes were the order of the day,

The result? Satisfactory! A
sound thrashing was delivered t o U.S.,

Last Wednesday we again closed
ranks on a formidable C.E.M. side i n
