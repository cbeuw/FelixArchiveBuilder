SF Soc
Returning revitalised from Eastercon, British
fandom's a n n u a l j a m b o r e e . , the S F S o c
committee is proud to present their only event
of the term. Next Tuesday (6:30pm, Mech Eng
220, 50p, 20p burble burble) we expect to
show The Rocky Horror Picture, that well-
known musical tale of adventure in which two
w h o l e s o m e e x a m p l e s of A m e r i c a n y o u t h
become embroiled in the internal squabbles of
a group of aliens escaped from an all-nighter at
the Scala Cinema. Entrance free to all those
suitably dressed. This will be followed by the
Society's A G M at which the elections for next
year's committee posts will take place (vote for
me, folks) and not before time, as this year's
President was reduced to a quivering mass of
protoplasm at Eastercon and another year
might finish him completely.

Easter saw, for ten of us, the highlight (so far)
of this year's activities, a week's camping in
Glen Coe. In amongst some of the highest
mountains in Scotland this must be one of the
most majestic settings in Britain. Several peaks
around the Glen were climbed in the first few
days (not to mention the west face of the
Blackwater reservoir dam) as we built up to
our climax, the triumphant ascent of Be.i
Nevis, Britain's highesr mountain.
This was just the first of this year's long
trips, we are now organising a three week trip
to Norway this summer a n d while on the
subject of future events we have two trips
planned this term. The first leaves for Cornwall
this evening, but the second is to Pembroke
J u n e 18-21, a repeat of last year's very
successful three days.
I now return to the subject of our A G M , a
well-attended meeting at the end of last term.
The principle purpose of the meeting was the
e l e c t i o n of n e x t y e a r ' s c o m m i t t e e , t h e
s u c c e s s f u l c a n d i d a t e s being: C h r i s J o n e s
(President), G o r d o n Folkard (Secretary), Ian
Jones (Treasurer), Sigrim Eriksen (Publicity),
M a r t y n Boutelle (Transport), a n d Natalya
Rycroft (Equipment).
UNSoc
The talk by George Courley o n the Canadian
Nuclear Policy was enjoyed by those who
attended but the numbers did not justify a
society meeting list of over 80. W e hope for an
improved attendance at o u r next meeting
which is on Tuesday at 1:00pm in the bowels of
the Huxley Building, Roomk 130. This is a talk
given by the Cultural Attache for the South
African Embassy o n their political philosophy.
This should be of particular interest to all those
concerned with Anti-Apartheid.
Bowling
Tournament-wise the T e n p i n Bowling C l u b
has had an average season starting off with
W a i M a n and K e v i n Short taking third place
at Brunei Doubles, also managing to bowl the
high game. T h e n for the third year running
honours were obtained at Pompey Quads.
This time A n d y Davis, K e v i n Short, Jeff
Q u i n n a n d Dave Smith gave an excellent
performance and came second.

S e v e n t i r e d I C cross c o u n t r y r u n n e r s
returned o n Sunday night with seventeen
other Impalas from the 25 stage, 17 hour long
B a t a v i e r e n relay race i n H o l l a n d ( a n d
Germany).
It all began at 5:30am o n Thursday, A p r i l
22, when the team piled into two minibuses
on our way to Dover. W e left College in great
spirits a n d managed to get as far as H y d e
Park Corner before the roofrack took a nose
d i v e onto the w i n d s c r e e n after a gentle
emergency stop. O u r second driving attempt
proved more successful a n d we boarded the
Zecbrugge ferry just two minutes before it
sailed.
W e spent a d a y s i g h t s e e i n g a r o u n d
Nijonegen and A r n h e m before the start of the
race on Friday night at midnight. C a r o l y n
W a l t o n ran the prestigious first leg to put the
Impalas in a strong position, improved still
further by T Asteriades i n the second leg.
T h e race continued through the night a n d

This is the most important university team
racing championship held i n this country.
This year eleven teams from E n g l a n d a n d
one from Delft, i n H o l l a n d , were invited. T h e
event was held the weekend before Easter at
Elton Sailing C l u b near Bury in Lancashire.
O n arriving at the lake even judgement
clouded b y the previous night told that
racing was near impossible.
After a two hour delay, as a very slight
ripple crossed the water and the race officer
had learnt to operate the automatic starting
system (a source of some distress to bcth h i m
and some competitors later i n the weekend) it
was decided that racing must begin.
T e a m r a c i n g tactics were of necessity
almost abandoned i n the light winds as team
members opted for boat speed in the hope of
i n d i v i d u a l success. C o n d i t i o n s i m p r o v e d
slightly for the afternoon but by the evening
it w a s c l e a r t h a t L i v e r p o o l , B r i s t o l ,
Cambridge a n d I C h a d the fastest "light
weather" helms a n d so it seemed likely that
the eventual winner would be one of three.
Sunday opened with similar prevailing
c o n d i t i o n s a l t h o u g h , s u p e r f i c i a l l y I C ' s
chances seemed to be improved by abstin-
ance the previous night. However the reverse
effect was evident a n d they proceeded to
throw away chances of w i n n i n g the trophy by-
losing to people w h o h a d previously been
considered " n o hopes" from the bottom of
the league. A s Salford filled i n their results on
the board it became clear that they had been
winning race after race (on protest) and since
I C h a d lost to Cambridge they had to beat
Liverpool, Bristol a n d Salford to remain i n
with any chance whatsoever. After dismissing
Bristol almost without a glance over their
shoulders a n d Liverpool with little more
difficulty the task of beating Salford began
Despite some excellent team racing a n d
individual sailing, as I C approached the last
straight they h a d a losing combination of
positions. T h e flame of hope was rekindled
however as the second place Salford boat i n a
first magnitude blunder, cuffed a n d sailed
one of his o w n boats and a n I C boat past the
mark so allowing one I C boat to pass a l l
three. So what had been clear victory turned
into an exciting dash for the line. U n f o r -
tunately Salford still w o n a n d i n so doing
clinched " t h e barrel". I C continued their
earlier collapse in their remaining races a n d
finished a disappointing sixth.
