Tebbit Defends Government Employment Policy
An ugly crowd of over 15 demonstrators gathered in front of
Mech Eng yesterday lunchtime as Norman Tebbit, the
Secretary of State for Employment, arrived to lecture the
Conservative and Industrial Societies.
They were cautioned by Professor P. Grootenhuis,
President of the Conservative Society, that Mr Tebbit was a
guest at the College and said that he didn't want any
"throwing and nonsense".
M r Tebbit arrived 20 minutes late and addressed a crowd of over
200 people in M e c h E n g 220. H e briefly outlined some of the major
objectives of the conservative government in the fields of industry and
employment. T h e 'ugly statistic' of 3 million unemployed was, he said,
almost inevitable in the face of world recession and he claimed that an
increase in productivity together with the limiting of inflation to just
over 10% should be set against the increase in unemployment.
A t this point four demonstrators wheeled their bicycles into the
lecture theatre and M r Tebbit quipped that he didn't underestimate
the mobility of labour.
He continued with an explanation of the Y o u t h O p p o r t u n i t y
Scheme ( Y O P S ) and outlined his reasons for proposing the Y o u t h
T r a i n i n g Scheme ( Y T S ) w h i c h will take effect in September 1983. M r
Tebbit considered that this scheme would provide good training lor
school leavers and would guarantee H i and 17 year olds a year's
employment.
After 15 minutes he stopped talking and invited questions from the
lloor.
A varied and often heated question session followed in which M r
Tebbit answered points ranging from his views on the similarity of the
conservative government a n d the Argentinian J u n t a , to the mobility of
labour and the proposed Y o u t h T r a i n i n g Scheme.
In answer to a question on the governments Employment Bill he
briefly outlined the m a i n points. H e said the bill was aimed to limit the
powers of the trade unions, especially with reference to the closed shop
political strikes (as opposed to industrial) and union only' labour
contracts. People would be offered a greater protection, including
those sacked due to refusal to join a closed shop.
There was a mixed response from the audience to these answers and
several points were made before M r Tebbit had to leave. A vote of
thanks was proposed by I C Industrial Society C h a i r m a n . M r Chris
Wilshaw.
