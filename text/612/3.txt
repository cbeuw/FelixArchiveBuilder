Thatcher Must Go!
by Frank James
What do the Falkland Islands mean to you? If
you are a miner then not a great deal I would
imagine since those who are prepared to work
in South Africa can have no qualms about
w o r k i n g for a n a u t h o r i t a r i a n g o v e r n m e n t
which has occupied British territory in the
process subjugating and depriving of human
rights some 1,800 British citizens. I find it
utterly appalling that suddenly the majority of
people in this country have discovered that
authoritarian regimes are nasty—I and people
like me have been saying it for years. (In the
case of South Africa this is not helped by
priests using economic arguments that are ten
years out of date to justify trading links with
South Africa and thereby implicitly support the
government there.)
Mrs Thatcher has not been previously noted
for her outspoken attacks on authoritarian
governments in Latin America; indeed she has
given explicit support to the involvement of the
U n i t e d S t a t e s in E l S a l v a d o r (where the
government find it hard to distinguish between
communists and catholics which is odd to say
the least). W h y are the Falkland Islands so
special then—on past record M r s Thatcher
s h o u l d w e l c o m e t h e e x t e n s i o n of a n
authoritarian government to areas where the
will of the people had previously been the chief
factor in the governmental process.
Yet she is spending millions of pounds in
endeavouring to recover the Islands (and as I
write this, the might of British power has just
overcome 44 members of the Argentine army
in South Georgia); why? The answer is quite
simple: if she does not make some gesture
then she would be removed from office by the
c o n s e r v a t i v e p a r t y who c a n n o t s t a n d the
thought of a British national humiliation as if
such virility symbols mattered today.
Yet whose fault is it that we are in the mess
that we are? T i e government's. This is a
typical example of the incompetence displayed
by the government in the three years that it
has been in office. They were elected on the
promise that they would put the economy in
order, restore law and order to society and
provide us with an effective defence strategy.
In the three years since the government came
to office unemployment has doubled, inflation
is not that much lower than when they came to
office (and for a long period it was considerably
higher) and they have failed to control the
P S B R . O n law and order they (and especially
that ineffectual H o m e S e c r e t a r y W i l l i a m
W h i t e l a w ) h a v e p r e s i d e d o v e r a d r a s t i c
increase in crime statistics and the worse civil
disturbances on the mainland in the living
memory of most people. A n d now in the one
area where conservative governments are
traditionally s u p p o s e d to be c o m p e t e n t —
d e f e n c e a n d f o r e i g n affairs — they have
presided over the greatest failure since Suez
(also a conservative failure).
For the government to bleat that it could
have done nothing to prevent the occupation
of the F a l k l a n d I s l a n d s is a d o w n r i g h t
perversion of the truth. O u r greatest Foreign
S e c r e t a r y s i n c e t h e w a r D a v i d O w e n
prevented the Argentines taking over the
Falkland Islands in 1977 by sending a task
force before a landing not after it. This fact has
not been denied by the government who are
probably too ashamed. Incidentally the reason
why David Owen has a bad reputation is that
he was far too good at his job which could not
be tolerated by the officials of the Foreign
Office. Thus the father of the chairman of the
Conservative Society here, who is our man in
Japan, has told his son—William C o r t a z z i —
that David Owen was a bad Foreign Secretary.
For a p a i d official to give their o p i n i o n ,
especially deliberately incorrect ones, based
on envy and hatred, about their democratically
elected master, is bad form to say the icast.
These are the sort of people who are running
the country at the moment and they are not to
be trusted.
Is there anything that you can do to help put
the s i t u a t i o n right? O n M a y 6 the local
elections are taking place and by voting for
your SDP/Liberal Alliance candidate you will
be giving M r s Thatcher notice to quit. D o not
be taken in by the military atmosphere in the
country at the moment; it is simply a political
ploy to save Thatcher's government; all right
wing governments resort to foreign adventures
when their home policy has failed.
Vote Alliance and say that Thatcher and the
Tory Party must go.
