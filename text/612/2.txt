to explode!
Students are warned to expect
l o u d b a n g s b y t h e Q u e e n ' s

These are not an invasion of
South Kensington by Argentina,
but part of something far more
terrifying. O n c e again the 1812

a c c o m p a n i e d by the Q u e e n ' s
T o w e r bells and cannon effects

This year the 1812 will be a
separate event from the I C W i n d

hoped that any I C woodwind or

come and join in. There will be
one r e h e a r s a l f r o m 7 : 0 0 to
10:00pm Tuesday in the Great

Sick Bay
on
Last L e g s ?
The future of the Sick Bay i n the
Princes Gardens Health Centre is
in the " m e l t i n g pot", a college
spokesman said this week. This is
a result of the continuing efforts
to e c o n o m i s e t h r o u g h o u t the
college.
Compulsory payment of a £\0
insurance p r e m i u m by first year
hall residents is just one of the
o p t i o n s b e i n g i n v e s t i g a t e d to
keep the Sick Bay open.
The Sick Bay has five beds and
costs a r o u n d £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 p . a . to
maintain. A t present a voluntary
insurance scheme operates and
administration of it's finances is
c o n s i d e r e d a n u n n e c e s s a r y
burden on the Health Centre
staff.
T h e t e c h n i c a l i t i e s o f t h e
p r o p o s e d s c h e m e a r e b e i n g
looked into so that a plan can be
p u t to t h e R e c t o r ' s p o l i c y
committee as soon as possible.
U n i o n p r e s i d e n t M r . N i c k
M o r t o n agrees to the idea ' i n
principle.'
