NOT the DP's bit
Southside Shop
M a n y p e o p l e still s e e m u n a w a r e of the
improved status of the Southside Shop. The
shop now sells all I C U and R S M regalia as well
as jumpers, sweatshirts, sports goods and a
wider range of groceries. The shop also has
more floor space and longer opening hours
than before. It is situated opposite Southside
Main Entrance, so why not pay a visit, and
look out for the Sports G o o d s Sale starting
Monday, M a y 10 at 11:00am.
Noticeboards
These have been allocated to all those clubs
and societies who asked for them. However ii
you missed out then fill in a form in the U n i o n
Office and I will redistribute areas later.
There are still many noticeboards left for
general use (and still more wall space) so I
hope no one will feel hard done by. Please
don't staple into noticeboards—I will supply
drawing pins on request.
Cleaning Materials
These are once more available, however this
time you will have to leave a Unioncard deposit
with me the day that y o u need c l e a n i n g
materials returnable when you have replaced
everything in the cleaning cupboard.
Rape Alarms
These are still available from the U n i o n Office.
Did you know
that you no longer need to be a member of
I C U to b u y I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e j u m p e r s ,
sweatshirts, scarves and ties. These are all on
s a l e i n t h e S o u t h s i d e S h o p ( o p p o s i t e
Southside main entrance).

Thanks to all of you who replied to my article
concerning N A S A scholarships, at the end of
last year. T o date there have been about fifty
requests for further information, and to those
of you who are still wondering why none has
been forthcoming, may I point out that the
closing date was April Fool's Day? I would also
Hue to thank the sender of the letter from
" E S A " threatening legal action and the like—I
really was quite worried.
T o wind up the year we have a lecture next
Tuesday by D r Murray at 6:30pm in Physics
LT2 about stellar parallaxers, and finally on
May 11 there will be a talk given by Prof J o h n
Taylor entitle " C a n we unify gravity with the
other forces of nature?" in which a different
viewpoint from that described by D r Isham in
the last lecture of last term will be discussed.
This promises to be an intriguing lecture which
is open to all members of College.
A n d finally does anyone want to be Internal
Secretary of AstroSoc next year? If so please
contact me (Ann Dziwior, Physics 2) or Carol
Burke (Physics 1). This isn't an April Fool!
SDP
I C S D S has now been in existence for one year
and is just five weeks younger than the party
which it supports. W e made our presence felt
right at the start with visits by Shirley Williams
and David Owen, then followed up these
successes with meetings on electoral reform
and with a useful liaison with London S D P
Students, whose activities this year reach a
high point with the first London S D P Students
Conference which will be held at IC on May 1.
Our "big names" meetings were attended by
approximately V20 of the College. Are the
other 95% not interested in how this radical
new party will affect their futures? If you are,
there will be an excellent opportunity to find
out about S D P policies on such matters as the
development of new technologies and the
training of scientists on Tuesday, May 4, when
Ian Wrigglesworth M P , the party spokesman
on science and technology, will be speaking .
