LOBBY OF GOVERNORS TODAY
IC students are to lobby College Governors today i n a b i d to
change the use of the regulator i n refectory price fixing and to
maintain the right of Refectory Committee to decide all food
prices.
The decision to lobby the Finance and Executive Meeting at
170 Queens Gate f r o m 10.00 a m today was taken at a well-
attended IC U n i o n Meeting on Tuesday this week after U n i o n
President M a r y Attenborough hinted that students might
shortly face a 5 per cent food price increase.
The Meeting also empowered the U n i o n Executive to organise a 24-
hour boycott of all student refectories if the lobby fails to achieve its
aims. After the response to last week's Southside boycott students were
confident that a general boycott call would be obeyed, and defeated an
amendment to limit action to one refectory only. N o date was fixed for
the boycott.

A motion calling for a full-time
U n i o n staff member to deal with
the housing problems of I C
students was passed by the
Meeting. T h e College will be
asked to provide extra cash for
this post.
Proposed by External Affairs
Officer Sheyne Lucock, the
motion also called for the closing
of loop holes i n the Rent Act,
security of tenure for a l l
residential occupiers, compulsory
purchase of empty property, a n d
the use of short-life property for
student housing.

FOOD PRICING THREAT
A proposal submitted by the Rector to the Finance and Executive
Committees on 16th February, if passed, could remove from the
Refectory Committee all decisions concerning refectory food pricing.
The proposal, which appeared under item 5 (Finances of Refectories:
Use of the Regulator) states:
'In the Rector's view, moreover, It Is Inappropriate for the Refectory
Committee Itself, whose membership consists largely of consumers, to
be Involved In decisions of this kind and the best arrangement Is tor the
regulator and the termly adjustments, If any, to be applied by the
Domestic Secretary In consultation with the Chairman, Refectory
Committee. He would, however, himself wish to be consulted about any
proposed termly adjustments, and, before authorising action, would
propose always to consult the President ICU and, where desirable,
other appropriate persons.'
At the moment, Refectory Committee, which has six voting student
members, can discuss the financing of the refectories. If this proposal is
implemented, though, prices could be increased, without reference to
the Committee, by the Domestic Secretary (Capt. J W G Lindley) and the
Chairman (Prof. S. Eilon) simply by applying the regulator. ICU need
not be informed of such increases which would necessitate the Union
having to monitor prices continually and comparing them with the FT
Grocery Index.
Although the Rector and the Union President would be consulted
should a termly review occur, there is no guarantee that such a review
would ever take place.
In an attempt to prevent this proposal being accepted, and to protest
at the past use of the regular, I C U decided to hold a lobby of the
governors attending today's F a n d E meeting (see-UGM report). It is vital
that this lobby is well-attended or else IC students may lose what little
say they have in the pricing of refectory food.
changes in housing law and
increased housing provision.
A U n i o n byelaw change
outlining a method of dismissing a
departmental representative was
given a first reading. This would
allow a meeting of 15 per cent of
the students in a department to
dismiss their representative.
I R E L A N D
Lengthy and heated discussion
on a motion dealing with the
problems of Northern Ireland
took place resulting in the passing
of policy unrelated to the terms of
J a n Czernuszka's motion.
The original motion stated that
" I r e l a n d is o n e n a t i o n " ,
condemned the British "colonial
force of occupation" and called
for a "total withdrawal of British
Imperialism from Ireland ".
R C S President Chris F o x and
I r i s h w o m a n L i z L i n d s a y -
proposed an amendment saying
that Northern Ireland is part of
the United K i n g d o m , that the
Government has a duty to
maintain law and order, and that
members of terrorist groups are
criminals and do not deserve
political status.
Despite an animated and
impassioned speech against the
amendment by another Irish
student, Des M c L e r n o n , it was
passed after several contributions
from both Irish a n d British
students.
A n a t t e m p t b y M a r y
Attenborough to change the
motion yet again was defeated
and Chris Fox's proposals became
U n i o n policy.
T h e Meeting was unable to
discuss two further controversial
motions on the legalisation of
cannabis and on gay rights before
jit was adjourned at 2.30 p.m.
