I CROSS COUNTRY
TEDDY HALL RELAY
Lacking for suitably tough competition
nearer home, our runners have been forced to
venture further afield to exercise their legs.
St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, were hosts for a 4 x
3 mile relay. The site of the first 4 minute mile
did not inspire an absentee-weakened team,
keeping us out of the medals, these being
taken by Bristol, Leicester (2nd and 4th) and
Beading. The former won in 65 minutes,
almost 3 minutes ahead of our A team. Ian
Morton led off, showing well in 5th position
along the river, but failing under a late-onset
hangover, handing over in 10th to Bryan
Acford who streaked round in ourfastesttime
of the day to gain four places, eyes set
intently on matching a female acquaintance
still finishing the first leg. The short legs of
Dave Rowson, happy on home ground, could
not however cope with the impromptu steeple
chase over VII Is left straddling the towpath,
passing baton in 7th place to Mick Pickard
who held position, striding out over a final
straight of 90% puddle to maintain a
creditable 7th place.
Way back in 31st, and last, position, the two
man Jesus College team encouraged each
other on this final quarter mile splash with
cries of "Come on Jesus, walk on water".
They paid for their blasphemy.
Meanwhile, a vendetta motivated Gary
Longhurst was running hard to place the B
team in 21st after the first leg, with Geoff
Sherwood recovering from being overtaken
by a middle-aged jogger to gain a place but
then lose it again, retching under the strain of
a sprint finish and a college pork pie. Nick
Bullock raised us3 places, demonstrating our
strength in depth, which depth abruptly
ended with a borrowed Oxford and England
orienteer gliding us up to a final 13th position.
This was still too low to avoid a shower queue
in changing rooms boasting a dry-ice heated
stone floor.

Last Saturday the 1979 Southern England
X-country championships were held at
Parliament Hill fields and Hampstead Heath.
North London, and some of the Club were
present to compete in the Junior Men's and
Senior men's races.
After making use of the luxurious changing
facilities and trying to get filmed by the beeb,
which seemed to depend on whether or not
you were swearing about the complete lack of
changing facilities as prompted by the Sound
Recordist. We were then ready for the start of
the Junior race which consisted of 2 laps of
the 3 mile circuit and proved to be very
heavy going.1
In this race Ian Morton ran
well to finish 82nd and Gary Longhurst came
129th.
After the Junior race the main race of the
afternoon the Senior Men's race was then
held. This race was of 9 miles duration
consisting of 3 laps of the circuit and was of a
very high standard, being contested by
Athletic Clubs from all over the South of
England.
The First IC runner to finish was Mark
.Pickard in 256th, who had opted to run in the
Senior although he was still a Junior, he was
followed home by Brian Acford in 2P2nd,
closely followed by Dave Rosen in 348*' • with
Geoff Sherwood coming 396th. Mick Kelly
was also present and helped with the
collecting of numbers and recording the
scores.

I.C. I V HONG KONG S.C. (Away) 6-3
The feature of this match, quite apart from
the six excellent wins achieved by Kumar and
Lakhani, was the bat-smashing Jeff Stean
(3rd team captain and voyeur) debacle - a
two-piece bat is no excuse for losing three
games (I do it with a one-piece bat).
I.C. II V DEPT.OF.EMP.III (away) 6-3
The winning run of the seconds was
continued here, despite all three players
losing to the D of E number one (who was
beaten by a certain fourth team player not
long ago).
The match was very close with both Tyre
and Sobhampanak having match points
against them before finally winning in three
games.

His amazement turned to worry when two-
thirds of his team failed to arrive by roll-ofi;
with about ten minutes to go before London
were entitled to claim a walkover in the first
game, the rest of the away team arrived,
rushed onto the lanes, and proceeded to take
the upper hand. Although the L o n d o n 2nd
and 3rd teams found some consistency in the
second game, both were only level on points
with Southampton after this stage.
Meanwhile the 1st team looked set for its
first defeat of the year. After losing two
games, the first by only two pins, some
marvellous bowling in the third, with a team-
a v e r a g e of 191 brought a win; a better total
pinfall resulted in a draw, preserving the lst's
unbeaten record. Another consistent game
from the 3rds brought a 3-1 victory, but the
2nds were unable to find the same rhythm
and scraped a draw by one pin in a total of
2279. T h e ladies lost 4-0 despite a 192 game
from P a n Sak.
Hence overall a very close match was lost
4-6, but the high pinfall kept alive L o n d o n
hopes for qualification to the next round.
Firsts: Tubby Woo, Roland Hsie, Joe .Ng,
Edmond .Ng, Danny Lau.
Seconds: Laurence Poon, John Knight, Fred Rad,
Brian Macgowan, Ron Johnson.
Thirds: Pete Churchyard, Edgar Fung, Nuri
.Nourshargh, Tim Hillyer, Alan Wong.
Ladies: Pan Sak, Linda Sim, Shirin Khamereh,
Ruby Wong, Ida Eok.

The competition was blessed with a local 4
p m bar extension. I can't think why because
Orienteers don't drink alcohol.
I would, at this point, like to disclaim on
behalf of the club, all responsibility for the
malicious falsehood printed on these pages
last week under the heading of Orienteering.
This tale of drunkedness and head-banging
originated from the cross-country club which
should have been obvious to anyone reading
the article anyway.

I.C.III V DEPT.OF EMP. IV (Home) 9-0
This was a close match which IC
dominated totally - the low point being the
brilliant play by Kwaku ping-pong Ansah,
(sorry, Frimpong!) who played in my absence
(Surrey Univ now lack several signs). Stean
and Reed also appeared in this farce (which
received rave reviews in the Underground
Press!).
I.C. IV V FULHAM (IV) (Home)
The disaster of this week was this loss by
default to a far inferior (one place below)
team. Pete Rutherford's flu bug (can
immortals catch flu?) and the non-
appearance of a second player presented 3
pts to the opposition - i.e. the b ds claimed
the match. Super Pewk (Hie!)

The following day, London again
managed to field four full teams, even
having two reserves, which meant the
Captain, Pete C h u r c h y a r d , had to select
a team for the first time this season.
After dropping himself, after only one
game, Pete had to substitute for R o n
Johnson, of Kingston Poly., who was
suffering the after-effects of too m a n y
parties and too m u c h drink.
The unfamiliar lanes at the Airport
resulted in 4-0 defeats for the ladies and the
3rds. The 2nds did little better, despite a 490
series from Albert Y u e and a 202 game from
J o h n Knight, and only succeeded in the third
game by one pin, giving a 3-1 defeat. T h e
only success for L o n d o n came from the lsts
with another good total pinfall bringing a 3-1
win. E d m o n d rolled a 588 series, following a
589 from T u b b y on Saturday, two of the best
series rolled by students nationally this
session. The final result was a 2-8 defeat, but
again good pinfall should mean progression
to the quarter-finals.
Firsts: Tubby Woo, Edmond .Ng, Joe .Ng, Roland
Hsie, Danny Lau.
Seconds: Brian Macgowan, John Knight, Fred
Rdd, Albert Yue, Ron Johnson (Pete Churchyard).
Thirds: Baz Heath, Lawrence Poon, .Nuri
.Nourshargh, Tim Hillyer, Edgar Fung.
Ladies: Ida Fok, Helen Chan, Delia Wong, Shirin
Khanereh, Ruby Wong.
M a n y thanks to all who played,
especially the drivers and Simon
Spurrier who was reserve for both
matches.
