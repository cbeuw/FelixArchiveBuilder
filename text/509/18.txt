There can no longer be any doubt that students are dissatisfied with
the refectory service at this college.
That is the view of IC Union Executive members and several Union
Officers after last week's 24-hour boycott call was followed by almost
the entire student body.
For much of the day's meal times the refectory was empty save a few
lonely eaters who had defied the pickets. Refectory staff stood huddled
around the service counter demoralised and watched the pickets
turning away customers at the entrance.
Only 45 meals were served in Southside student refectory on
Thursday: 8 breakfasts, 27 lunches and 10 evening meals. In Linstead
Hall, where the evening meal is brought from the Southside kitchens,
only 24 of the 120 residents ate in hall after the Union had asked them to
sign out in support of the boycott.
Refecto.'y Committee Chairman Professor Eilon is not, however,
convinced that there is widespread dissatisfaction. In his view students
obeyed the boycott call purely out of loyalty to the Union and because
of the presence of pickets on the door. He pointed out that the boycott
leaflet had told students to stay away from Southside even if they were
satisfied with some meals.
I saw several people being turned away by the pickets. A n d the
Union's alternative food service, which provided about 120 lunches,
certainly influenced many.
But Union Secretary Mike Elkin told FELIX that it was mainly staff who
needed persuading not to eat in Southside and that many students
made no attempt even to approach the picket line.
A n d Barry Austin, proposer of the boycott motion at the Union
meeting, said that he visited Southside refectory the next day and
people had told him that they had taken part in the boycott because they
agreed with its aims.
The Union alleges that the quality of food is poor, prices are too high
and inflation price increases are too great. T h e boycott was called to
protest at all these.
But refectory staff were confused over the students' aims and many
took the boycott as a personal attack on their work. They did not
understand why Southside should have been singled out and had
expected" the boycott to be called off after the abandoning of a
threatened price increase in January.
The Southside Supervisor said she had seen many students eating in
the refectory for three years, which did not indicate widespread
dissatisfaction. Complaints were usually only about food not being hot
enough and staff said that if a student made a genuine complaint about
a meal it was always exchanged.
Staff had prepared food for about 200 at lunchtime and said that the
meals would be wasted.
Catering Manager Victor Mooney, whose name is synonymous with
College food, told FELIX that the meals would not be served again the
next day. He said that his thoughts about the boycott would be
unprintable. Such action could only result in further cuts in services and
unemployment of refectory staff.
He recalled the far greater choice of refectories available to IC
students in the late 60s and claimed that boycott action in 1969-70 had
brought services down to their present level.
He said that the cheap restaurants had an easier task than he as they
were open all day and 52 weeks a year. He was providing a service
taylored to the needs of IC students. This was the only London College
serving meals at weekends, he claimed.
As if the boycott itself was not enough, when the refectory closed 20
minutes early at lunch time due to lack of customers, Paul Davies, one of
the pickets, led a group of students to sign the complaints' book in
protest at the early closing.
What the boycott has achieved remains to be seen. Professor Eilon, in
a statement reprinted elsewhere in FELIX, says that such action can
only undermine the financial position of the refectories and that the
burden will fall on the customers. The food was not perfect but
improvements were being made.
Union Officers however consider the action very successful and say
that the College must now take note of students' feelings.
