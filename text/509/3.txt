J O B S IN S O U T H A F R I C A
Following the Union's protests
about the visit of Roberts
C o n s t r u c t i o n the A c a d e m i c
Affairs Committee discussed
means of implementing U n i o n
p o l i c y o n the e n d i n g of
recruitment of students for jobs in
South Africa.
Members heard that one third
of all mining students go to South
Africa and it would be very
difficult to persuade them to
boycott these jobs.
T h e Committee decided to
mount a poster campaign in the
autumn term, to send a letter to
all final year undergraduates and
to include a page on South Africa
in the Alternative Prospectus
pinpointing its relevance to this
college.
The U n i o n is to raise the
question of non-cooperation by
the Careers Advisory Service over
informing interviewees about
South Africa at the next meeting
of the College Board of Studies.
G R A N T S M A R C H
IC U n i o n is to participate in
