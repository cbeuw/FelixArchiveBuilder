sst! Have you heard the buzz? Opsoc's latest annual light opera
offering, 'The G r a n d Duchess of Gerolstein' is really pulling in the
masses. O r at least, this production deserves to. Still, you have
tonight and tomorrow left, so I'll give you some idea of what you are in
for.
Opsoc, in the person of Ian Gledhill (Producer) have resurrected this
once most popular work by Jacques Offenbach ('Can-Can' to peasants
like you and me) i n a fresh and entertaining manner. T h e plot is
supposedly a satire on G e r m a n militarism and chronicles the fortunes of
Fritz, a private soldier, admirably played and sung by...(rustle, rustle,
search through programme)... Terence Newcombe. Fritz is a good ole
down-to-earth bod w h o stones plenty of crows and raves about his
magic Wanda(Delith Brook). She raves about h i m and so a l l is
sweetness and light- until theDuchess(a fine performance by Deborah
Johns on) shows up. T h e Duchess being a well brought u p a n d
sheltered girl naturally has fantasies about whatever is inside a uniform,
especially if they are clean wholesome and stone crows. Inevitably,
Fritz becomes the latest pet and rockets to Commander-in-Chief of the
Dvichess's A r m y , much to the dismay of the current incumbent. T h e
Duchess's affection for Fritz does not endear h i m to her current suitor,
the rather wet Prince Paul (Tim Johnson) or the Duchy's Chamberlain
Baron Puck(Steve Chaytow) who, along with the e x - C - i n - C , General
Boum(Richard Stockton), cobble together and prescribe a treatment of
blood-letting, preferably Fritz's.
To amputate a convoluted plot, Fritz falls the way he rose when the
Duchess discovers that he prefers Wanda's ravings to those of her own.
A l l inevitably ends happily with Fritz and W a n d a paired off to produce
more soldiers for the A r m y , and Prince Paul drying out and no longer
looking delicate ten feet in front of the Duchess.
'The Duchess of Gerolstein' is assuredly a 'sparkling and tuneful' work,
very popular in the second half of last century. However, this century it
has somewhat fallen from grace - only being recently revived
professionally. Ian Gledhill suggests that'the subject matter - a satire on
German militarism was hardly appropriate after the rigours of two world wars.'
The Opsoc production includes a new version of the T h i r d Act,
mostly reworked by the Producer. T h e original opera included a
bedroom scene in the T h i r d Act but this was erazed from the D ' O y l y
Carte Production i n 1897. T o return to the original score meant
restoring a bedroom scene- hence the reworking.
As usual the Opsoc stalwarts were in fine voice - items I particularily
enjoyed were the ' D u t y ' duet between Fritz and W a n d a and the Sabre
routine.Acting generally seems to have improved o n previous years'
performances - characters appeared less wooden than usual; one
example - I have not seen anyone look as angry as Delith Brook.
Choreography of Opsoc productions is a perennial problem - more
than half a dozen people dancing on the Concert H a l l stage at one time
bears more resemblance to the Shed when Chelsea manage a no-score
draw than musical entertainment. However there is no solution save
finding an improved stage. While restricted to such economy of space,
though, Opsoc soldier on exceedingly well.

ome things I always enjoy about Opsoe product ions. O n e is that
everybody, no mallei what their standard o f acting and/or
singing, lias a I borough ly gooil I ime putting on a show. Another is
that membership is not only current students. However il is almost
always the ease thai the audience does not ronlain many IC
students.Maybe you ran prove me wrong.
So il you enjoy opera, or ("like me; endure i l , you should see'Tlie
Duehess of Getolsteiii'. After all, il's all good fun in I lie bar afterwards!
