Brain Drain
REFECTORY BOYCOTT
The Boycott was, on the whole, a great success. Thanks are due to all
who helped, particularly Andy and Chris who organised the alternative
food. A few students did eat in Southside on that day (mostly just the
moron element which every College suffers from who are determined to
go out of their way to oppose the views of the vast majority), but most
people who did turn up to eat soon realised that the alternative food was
both better and cheaper.
A n d isn't a strange coincidence that chicken dishes were served
during and on the day after the boycott?
ENTS DISCOS
Ents had their first disco in the Lower Lounge last week after repairs to
the floor had been completed, and most people seemed to think it was a
good idea to hold it in the same room as a bar. Unfortunately this will not
be able to be repeated for a few weeks for various reasons, but I hope
that this will become their regular room in the future. The numbers who
attended last week seemed to easily compensate Ents for having to
reduce their entry charge to 10 p (a condition upon which they were
allowed to use the room).
FIRE ALARM
There was a false fire alarm last week, which unfortunastely provoked
little response from the occupants of the Union Building at the time.
Everyone knows that the majority of five alarms in the Union are false
ones caused by some idiot pissed out of his head, but there only has to
be a real one once and someone is likely to die if they don't get out. So
next time it happens, shift your bloody arses out of the place without me
having to come and kick them!
R.S.M. CANTEEN
There have been more complaints about I.C. students using the Royal
School of Music canteen at peak times; I know our refectory meals are
lousy, but please stop using the R S M between 12.30 and 1.30, otherwise
they're going to stop us using it altogether.

More Mutterings
I'm sorry about m y absence f r o m the pages o f F E L I X last
week. I decided to pretend to be i l l because I couldn't take the
stresses of being President any longer. W h i c h rather naturally
brings m e on to the controversy surrounding Welfare Day.
Abortion. A couple of people have commented about abortion, not
liking the inference of the article that I wrote in F E L I X in the Welfare
supplement. As Welfare D a y was aimed at giving people information
about services available to them, I cannot see that there was anything
wrong in the information contained in that article. Furthermore, for
those people interested in the U n i o n policy on this issue I should point
out that our U n i o n supports the National Abortion C a m p a i g n and that
every woman should have the right to decide whether to terminate her
pregnancy. Both the so-called "Positive Alternatives to A b o r t i o n "
Society and also a letter appearing in last week's F E L I X , seem to be
opposed to the concept of the woman deciding as to whether she wishes
to continue a pregnancy. It would seem to me to be a personal right to
decide.
Refectories. As you probably know, the Refectory boycott was an
overwhelming success. I must thank Chris Fox and A n d y Lewis for such
a marvellous job with the food, (everybody agreed that it was better
than the normal service) and they even managed to make a. £5.12 and a
half pence profit, (something like 5% of turnover). It looks like we may
be no nearer stopping the use of the regulator in the way in which it has
been used in the past, i.e. food prices may continue to go up by the full
amount of the Financial Times Grocery price index. By now a U G M
should have taken some more policy on this and I hope we'll be able to
get a change of heart from college.
The U n i o n is also very much concerned about offering constructive
suggestions for the Refectory management to consider. If you have any
ideas please come and see me and we will pass them on.
Social Functions. A letter in F E L I X a couple of issues ago suggested
that there was too much clashing of social functions on the same night.
Although there is some feeling that anybody who doesn't want to clash
can stop themselves from doing so we thought we might give a whirl to
a new idea and that is Annie (int. 2232) will keep a bookings book for
any social functions, either in or outside College being organised by
someone in College. So, if you don't want to clash you can ring up
Annie and ask her if she knows of anything on that date. This of course
will only work if everybody voluntarily decides to tell Annie the date of
their functions.
Bicycles. Just to prove yet again that I really do read F E L I X , there
was another letter a couple of weeks ago, about bicycles getting lost
around College. Although I haven't had any time to look into College
arrangements for bicycles there is one small thing you can do to help
stamp out bicycle stealing, i.e. that is register your bike with your local
police station. Apparently each bike has a frame number. If you live i n
Kensington I have obtained the appropriate forms and they are in the
U n i o n Office, (with Annie).
Don't forget that papers go up for sabbatical elections on Monday,
19th February, and if you don't want to stand you can always come
along and join in the fun at Hustings on M a r c h 8th.

STRIKES AGAIN
Hello Students, are you sitting comfortably and listening out there?
Good, then I'll begin. Once upon a time there existed three bears who
lived up in I C U n i o n Office and disguised themselves as U n i o n Officers.
Every week they used to dream of naked bodies and various forms ol
bizzare sex. They also used to write obscure articles for F i d . I X which
went like:
Social Colours
I am now accepting nominations for social colours. A n y member of
the U n i o n can nominate anybody for absolutely anything - and all
nominations are judged by a colours committee which awards colours
to people who have made a significant contribution to the n o n -
academic life of the U n i o n . So let's be having your nominations.
Closing date for nominations: M a r c h 16th.
Insurance
If you've got a musical instrument, I received today some h u m p h
from people who specialise in insuring instruments for students (so it
seems). So if you've got a good organ - come up and see me about it.
