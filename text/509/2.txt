Dear Sir, - I was somewhat
desturbed by a letter in last weeks
edition of F E L I X from Andrew
White which claimed that I had
written an article in F E L I X no
506 on the subject of abortion
w h i c h d e m o n s t r a t e d ' a
frightening level of insensitivity'.
As far as I can ascertain from
re-reading that edition, the only
mention of abortion was in a
factual article about birth control
and other matters. If M r . White
had been able to control his
indignation sufficiently to read to
the bottom of the page, he would
have noticed that the article was
written by M a r y Attenborough
and not be me.
Welfare Day and the articles in
the preceeding edition of F E L I X
were not designed to express a
particular viewpoint on any
subject but to present a number of
different opinions and sets of
information in order to help
people make up their own minds
on the various issues raised.
For the purposes of my job as
Welfare Adviser, my personal
views are irrelevant. I am only
c o n c e r n e d w i t h p r e s e n t i n g
alternatives never with foisting
opinions and I have never
attempted to voice my personal
views on such matters, in F E L I X
or anywhere else.
If M r . White is interested in*
c o n s i d e r i n g the w i s d o m of
committing actionable libels
(especially against lawyers), I
would be happy to advise him!
Yours faithfully,
Michael Arthur
Welfare Adviser
Dear Sir,- Bearing in mind the
points raised by Bob Bradley in
his letter to F E L I X last week, as
C h a i r m a n of IC Liberal C l u b . I
would like to say how sorry I am
that he was unable to come along
to the club meeting last Thursdav
(8th February 1979) at which
many of the points that he raised,
were discussed. If Bob is still not
receiving club mailings, or if he
wishes to have a chat about,
F O R W A R D ! , then if I can find a
spare moment, I will be delighted
to see him sometime.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Fairbairn
(Chairman, IC Liberal Club);
Dear Sir, - I would like to thank
all those who gave their support to
the boycott. Especial thanks must
go to the new catering staff who
p u t on an e x c e l l e n t a n d
imaginative alternative. Thanks
also to those who helped to picket.
Due to their efforts there were
only 69 scabs, 8 at breakfast, 27 at
lunchtime and 10 at the evening
meal with 24 at Linstead Hall.
We hope that all these efforts will
be rewarded by the management
meeting our demands.
Once again many thanks.

Dear Everybody, - Thank you
very much for being so kind
getting some money so that I can
have a Phonic Ear of my own. I
would like to have one very much
because the Lyons Club, and lots
of kind people, have raised money
so that all the children in my Unit
at Honiton can have one each to
use in the Unit but, next year, I
shall be twelve and have to go to
another school, probably an
ordinary school, where I will not
be able to hear the teacher
properly with my Philips aids.
W i t h the Phonic Ear, I can hear
the teacher all the time even when
she has her back turned.
I have been deaf since I was
fourteen months when I had
meningitis. I will be very happy if
you can help me have a Phonic
Ear of my own. I hope I will be
able to come to London to see
you,
Love from â€ž
Jerome.
Dear Sir, - If the Islamic Society
find Western Society so repulsive
and decadent why are they and
their Islamic brethren so keen to
come here? It couldn't possibly be
that they want to break the
shackles of Islam and have a
Western education, to be free to
write critical letters to newspapers
and to protest about govern-
ments' ("blasphemy" - Ayatollah
Khomeini), to drink alcohol, to
gamble, to steal without having-
their hands chopped off or to buy
sex without being liable to be
hanged for adultery?
If they really want to criticize
Western Society then let them do
so from their repressive (to women
and non-moslem at least) Islamic
Republic and not when they are
living in safety and hypocrisy
here.

Dear Sir. - We would like to
answer the points made by M r .
Thomson in his letter last week
with reference to strengthening
apartheid and to comment on the
issue of picketing interviews held
here by firms operating in South
Africa.
M r . Thomson is putting
forward that the only way of
strengthening apartheid is by
voting or joining the South
African army. Surely, any person
who puts the fruits of his training,
initiative and experience into a
company is actively supporting
and strengthening that company.
It is such companies that have
built up and are maintaining the
apartheid system. Their massive
profits rely on the cheap labour
and minerals provided by the
blacks and their land.
M r . Thomson also claims that
the presence of English speaking
whites weakens the Afrikaaners'
position. The Afrikaaners' are not
stupid or inexperienced as far as
m a i n t a i n i n g their l u c r a t i v e
position goes - the introduction of
other whites into engineeringjobs
is not to take the jobs of
Afrikaaners but to fill the
vacancies created by their policy
of not letting blacks become
engineers with any responsibility.
The introduction of highly
trained people from Britain and
other countries thus enables the
companies to keep the blacks
uneducated and in a position for
easy exploitation.
But to take the above points
further, every individual plays a
role in the struggle for or against
the apartheid system since they
create an atmosphere of opinion,
w h i c h , for instance, either
discourages or encourages people
to take jobs in South Africa. This
role is not insignificant.
Finally, on the issue of having
a picket at the interviews for such
jobs. We support picketing these
interviews and, having discussed
this with many people, feel it
important to clarify what we
mean by picketing. We mean
serious picketing, the purpose of
which is to have detailed
discussions not only with the
people entering and leaving the
interview room but also with
passers-by. As a general principle
we believe that it is only in
possession of the facts relating to
t h e s i t u a t i o n a n d w i t h
t h o r o u g h g o i n g discussion to
establish the validity of such facts,
their importance and relevance
and to develop an overall analysis
of the situation, that a person can
make a proper decision.
For this particular picket we
feel the aim of discussion should
be to establish: -
1) The situation in South Africa
and the means by which it is
maintained.
2) ^'he role played by a person
going to work in South Africa.
