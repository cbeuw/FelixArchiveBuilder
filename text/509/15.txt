COMMUNITY ACTION GROUP
The Community Action Group is struggling on i n its
attempts to involve students in the activities of the real world.
Its ongoing activities are continuing as usual but attempts to
broaden the range are progressing but slowly.
Drivers continue to be the main inhibition as it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find someone to fill the gaps and as the group's
activities are almost totally dependent on them it become increasingly
difficult to operate. This is why I a m trying to introduce driverless
activities like the 'New Horizon' thing I've been plugging lately.
Therefore this week's offering is
for activities we can organize in
conjunction with the Imperial
College R e d Cross Detachment,
( I C R C D ) . T h e I C R C D is in
contact with volunteer agencies
that are desperate for people to
help in the local hospitals, (not in
s t r i k e - b r e a k i n g a c t i v i t i e s )
assisting with the social welfare of
patients, something the full time
nursing staff just haven't the time
to provide but of which they say,
is just as important as the medical
attention. If you help with some of
these activities, the range is wide,
from hospital shops to bedside
visiting, then contact me or
preferably Roger Serpell, of the
I C R C D who can put you in touch
with the relevant agency. Roger
can be contacted via internal
mail (Aeronautics) or phone
internal 3707.
The reason I a m issuing these
pleas on behalf of the I C R C D is
that Roger has his hands full with
the first aid side, especially now as
they are on emergency stand-by,
for the London ambulance service
and doesn't have time to organize
the welfare side. If anyone is keen
on this sort of thing, the I C R C D
are looking for a group leader to
take on this administrative side of
the organization, the volunteer
need have no first aid experience
but will be given training if
desired. If you are interested
please contact Roger as soon as
possible as this situation has been
dragging on for some time now
while the hospitals are crying out
for this help.
Don't forget the I C C A G
meeting this Monday, 12.30
p m . Green room, Feb. 19th.,

Do YOU recognise the 'logo'
illustrated above ???
No it's not anything to do with
the u n d e r g r o u n d , t e c h n i c a l
drawing or faulty Polos. It is, in
fact, the symbol of one of I.C.'s
three major entertainment and
news media, STOIC. (Student
Television of IC).
If you've never heard of STOIC
or are not satisfied by the service
provided by STOIC, do something
about it!! Join STOIC and improve
the programmes ! STOIC needs
more members so that it can
extend it's coverage to events
external to I.C. and also improve
the coverage of internal events.
If you are interested or would
like further details of STOIC'S
activities you are welcome to
attend S T O I C ' S p r o d u c t i o n
meetings at 12.40 in the STOIC
office in the Union building on
Mondays and Fridays. Or come to
the TV Studio (Near Elec. Eng.) at
16.30 on Wednesdays.
Some imminent events are, the
GUILDS/IF Valentines party to be
held in the J C R on 16th Feb.,
tickets are 50 p in advance from
Guilds Union Office, IF and social
reps, - an event not to be missed
with a disco, free food and late
bar.
On 20th Feb. is that amazing
event - the Field Cup. For an
e v e n i n g of s o l v i n g c l u e s ,
collecting treasure and getting
ever so drunk submit a team to
Dave Walls on the night. Teams
should consist of five or more
people. Also needed for this event
are marshals, who stay in one pub
all night and give clues, mark up
points and accept lots of alcoholic
bribes - please put your name up
in the Guilds Union office as soon
On Sunday 25th Feb. are the
Guilds Soccer Sixes, teams to be
submitted to Clive Whiteside

Anyone who is likely to stand for election to any IC Union Post and
would like to make a short promotional programme for transmission
over STOIC'S network should contact Dave Warwick (EE2) of STOIC
via the Elec. Eng. letter racks, or via the college TV*Studio.
it is essential that anyone wishing to make one of these 'pro mos'
should contact Dave as soon as possible because STOIC's studio time
is very limited.
