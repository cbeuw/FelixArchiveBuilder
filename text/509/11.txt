No, I didn't flip, I decided to go and see
both of the two prominent horror films
o f the m o m e n t a n d w a s n o t
disappointed by either. T h u s you are
going to be treated to a double bill of
contrasting styles, so please bear with

Caution; the following review contains
sickening praise for a cult hero and an
obscure reference to a famous English
c o m e d i a n . T h e E d i t o r a c c e p t s no
responsibility for the mental state of non-hip
readers who continue past this line.
Halloween 1963 in the small town of
Haddonfield, Illinois. J u d i t h Myers, instead
of looking after her brother M i c h a e l , is
necking with her boyfriend (well perhaps not
just necking). The camera watches on silently
and scans around the outside of the house. It
takes the part of Michael's eyes as he follows
the movements of his sister. H e enters the
kitchen and removes a large knife from the
drawer. The boyfriend leaves, the camera
silently ascends the stairs, picks up a
discarded halloween mask, raises the knife
and .... strikes!
F I L M S
This is the start of the latest offering from
director J o h n Carpenter of " D a r k S t a r " and
"Assault on Precint 13" lame. A cult hero in
England, he is an exciting artist who can
n u m b the senses and flare the imagination
with enviable ease. Anyone who has seen the
above films may well expect a minor
masterpiece produced on an inhihitivc
budget. Well this time I believe lie even
overcomes the budget.
Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Sam Lootnis. a
psychiatrist who treats mad M i k e lor 15
years, during which the lad never speaks but
just slates at a wall. Fortimalcly Ihis period is
omitted from the film and the story resumes
on October 30th 1978. M i k e suddenly
decides to skip the loonie bin in Loomis' car
and returns to Haddoiilicld lor Halloween.
Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a plain, studious
virgin who, along with her two friends Annie
and Lynda, becomes (lie centre of the
constant (although distant) attention of
Michael. She sees a strange masked face at
every corner. Carpenter cleverly uses the
association of the moving camera shot with
the killer's eyes to produce fear at every hedge
or tree.
L a u r i e is b a b y s i t t i n g t h a t n i g h t
(conveniently) and also her friends happen to
be doing likewise over the road. They,
however, plan to use the opportunity to
entertain their male friends in all sorts of
interesting ways. The director has now set the
scene for the gruesome events of that evening.
The action is genuinely shocking without the
need for rivers of blood - no, no that would
annihilate its icy elegance, (indeed, even
Tony Hancock as the reluctant blood donor
would supply more than appears in the
story). Carpenter chooses instead to weave
suspense into every frame. This ensures that
you look for every detail in the dark rooms; a
hint of white mask or flash of steel. Thus you
become part of the farce, making the whole
film enjoyable and pleasantly shocking.
The monster (Tony Moran) does a lot of
heavy breathing and is cast as the bogey m a n
- a Halloween trick on legs, the maniac who is
purely evil and the sadist who takes pleasure
in his work, all at once. Promiscuity is dealt
with swiftly and painfully in an O l d
Testament style. The girls are your outer self-
roaming dark rooms, leaving doors not only
open but also unlocked - while Laurie is the
healthy virgin who overcomes all. The film
rises to an astonishing multi-levelled climax
which raises gasps all over the cinema every
time. Take an arm along to hold onto, (or
even two arms!) Don't think you won't need
the change of underwear either. C a n S a m
Loomis save Laurie and her friends? W i l l you
have the good sense to go and see this
excellent movie? W i l l I eventually start on
the next review
C.I.C. (contrived intro soc) now gives you,
M A G I C (X, Odeon H a y m a r k e t , Dir. Sir
R i c h a r d Attenborough)

I sit on his knee,

Hocus Pocus,

Magic is fun;

After receiving Roger Stotesbury's kind
permission (I'll let you out next week Roger).
1 trotted oil to see my second horror film in
three days. The film had caught my
imagination after hearing the above poem on
Capital R a d i o ^coincidence? ) which I
thought was somehow compelling. I hoped
that my Halloween experience would not
affect my opinion of the film. Judge for
yourself.
" M a g i c " is, broadly speaking, the story of
a man's tragic love for a married woman and
his battle with success. Anthony Hopkins
gives a superb performance as Corky, a
talented magician. H e has an initial flop with
his act due to a lack of stage presence, but
after incorporating Fats, a ventriloquist's
dummy, he has more success. Fats is a foul
mouthed extrovert, everything that C o r k y is
not, but perhaps wishes to be. Ben Greene
(Burgess Meredith) discovers Corky and
negotiates a big T . V . deal. T h e act
meanwhile has become famous and C o r k y
cannot bear the strain. H e disappears to his
old home town and meets Peggy, (Ann-
Margaret) who is an old flame. H e relies on
Fats to trap his beloved and slowly slips into
total schizophrenia. The bulk of the film
deals with this relationship and Corky's
mental decline.
It is totally unfair to compare this film with
Halloween in any way. It is another type of
horror: more subtle, not intended to shock
but to arouse mental terror which cannot be
easily expressed. T h e violent moments are
dealt with as they should be - as coarse, brutal
action. Y o u can almost feel the pain in fact.
Attenborough must be congratulated for the
way in which he contrasts Corky's schizoid
solitude with the mild mannerisms when he is
with Peggy. Fats is not the ideal dummy, but
he takes on more and more life as the film
progresses. I found the quality of dialogue,
acting and direction very high and just
cannot wait to see more of Anthony Hopkins.
I came out of the cinema, not with an audible
buzz, but with racing mental activity. T h e
film thus seemed to last for hours longer than
a mere 107 mins. I don't wish to say any more
about this film because I feel it may spoil your
enjoyment. It is strange, compelling, eerie.
W h a t better recommendation could you ask
for?
