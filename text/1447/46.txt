‘Just remember the five D’s of dodge-
ball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge’.
I am afraid to say I have given into the
temptation of stealing a cheeky quote
from the film ‘Dodgeball: The true
underdog story’ however it is incred-
ibly relevant with respect to the recent
performance of the club. An infant of
only two years old, the dodgeball club
challenged the UK’s leading teams at
the London tournament last Saturday.
The tournament began with our first
team sweeping 5-0 victories against
two well-established clubs as well as
the second team securing an initial
victory of 5-0 but our juggernaut-like
performance was halted by the ‘Jammy
dodgers’. The ‘Jammy dodgers’ who
have won the University champion-
ship on two occasions and one of their
members has had his throw measured:
he can fire a dodgeball at speeds up to
65mph (105kmph). The 1st’s enjoyed
an early lead but our valiant efforts
were thwarted by our lack of tourna-
ment experience meanwhile the 2nd’s
encountered another goliath of an
opponent. They faced a team whose
average throw speed was 50mph and
contained an unnameable beast with
afro-like hair that has been measured
to fire a dodgeball at up to 85mph. The
2nd’s saw some inhumane dodging
from their captain, Jag and Alby but
even they were overcom.
The tournament progressed with a
fantastic series of dodgers from mem-
bers of both teams with a significant
majority of thrown dodgeballs being
successfully dodged by the players
in each team. Two years of dodgeball
within the tight space of the Union
Dining Hall had sharpened our dodg-
ing skills but weakened our throw-
ing abilities. But both teams battled
forward courageously and the 1st’s
steam-rolled our way into the semi-
finals, faced the 85mph thrower and
his team but gave a fantastic fight
with one match where we eliminated
their entire team with no losses. But
a dodgeball match consists of 5 games
and we were narrowly defeated 3-2 by
the Leicester Ligers.
The contrast between the Leices-
ter Ligers, a team in white Lycra kits
patterned with meticulously designed
tiger-like creatures that had a surreal-
ism that wouldn’t look out of place in
a Dali painting and our £1.98 white
Primark T-shirts with black-marker
penned numbers on the back empha-
sised our tournament inexperience but
this also highlighted the potential of
Imperial college’s dodgeball team. A
team who after only one year can chal-
lenge the UK’s top teams and this was
Dodgeballprogression
Christopher Jones Dodgeball
recognised by the tournament organis-
ers who proudly awarded our 1st team
with a team achievement award. The
organisers described our 1st team as
‘the best performance seen by a team
in their first tournament ever!’ and this
was also a distinguishing characteristic
of the 2nd team as well.
Dodgeball is considered a joke sport.
An offshoot from a witty film with
Vince Vaughn (and others) and recent-
ly quoted by Boris Johnson in his de-
scription in the things he must do as a
politician (‘Dodge, duck, dip, dive and
dodge’). It hasn’t received the most se-
rious publicity but there are almost 200
teams in the UKDBA league (approx.
100 of which are university teams).
The university championships will test
our team to its new experienced limits
and it is unacceptable to have a lesser
university as the university dodgeball
champions – especially if it is Warwick
who currently hold the title.
