SNOOPING THROUGH THE ARCHIVE
DEPUTY EDITOR KADHIM SHUBBER PICKS A FEW OF HIS FAVOURITE STORIES FROM 60 YEARS OF FELIX
Spot the
difference
This story is fantastic
in so many ways. To
begin with, you have
to wonder what some-
body has to do to their
room to offend the
Warden to the extent
that he throws you out.
Moreover, building a
reputation for “wreck-
ing your room” makes
it look like that they
kept fixing it, only for
Carl Burgess to trash
it again, like some old
cartoon gag.
Add into the mix the
fact that we’re talking
about the President of
the Union and this sto-
ry is heading towards
the bizarre. Better still,
it’s not clear whether
the felix Editor at the
time had a sense of hu-
mour and used an em-
barassing photo of Carl
Burgess or whether our
President in 1984 was a
stark raving lunatic.
Either way, the idea
that his room was so
horrifying that the
cleaners wore masks is
hilarious. Ashley, you
still have 6 months. Go
on, shave your head
and trash your room!
Ashley Brown: ‘Generally quite nice.’
Have you ever felt that
it would be impossible
for the Union to get big
name acts? And sure,
even if the Union could
attract some interest-
ing bands, we’d never
be able to afford it.
Well take hope from
this great photo from
1967. The Union used
to put on something
called Carnival which
I assume was some-
thing like the Summer
Ball. In that year, the
organiser Jerry Stock-
bridge got none other
than the legendary Jimi
Hendrix as the Carni-
val finale. Beats Ath-
lete, right?
If that hasn’t already
put recent organisers
of the Summer Ball to
shame, Jerry Stock-
bridge also managed to
turn a profit of £3,500
(that’s around £50,000
today using retail price
index for inflation).
You would imagine
that after achieving a
record 50% increase in
profit, Mr Stockbridge
would relax and think
“Job Done”. No he told
the then Editor R. J
Redmayne, “The job
at Carnival each year
must be to surpass the
previous year’s profit.”
Mmm, doesn’t sound
like he’d be much fun
on the weekend.
Admittedly, it’s an-
noying when you pick
up felix and discover a
spelling, grammar or
punctuation error (be-
lieve me, it’s more an-
noying for us).
Whenever I see an
apostrophe that’s gone
astray, I take comfort
in remembering that
Dan Wan (pictured
right) isn’t the first Edi-
tor that’s received flak
for errors in the paper.
In 1983, Pallab
Ghosh (now a success-
ful science journalist)
was felix Editor and
given the nature of
his end of year ‘award’,
probably had a hard-
time of it.
I suspect that we’ll
never quite know what
‘things in general’ he
disregarded but given
his following career
success, I imagine that
the lessons he learnt as
felix Editor have stuck
with him ever since.
60 years of
serious headlines
Americans weren’t welcome even in 1989
When you go into
the examination hall,
you obviously have a
lot weighing on your
mind. The last thing
you’d expect is that af-
ter slogging through 3
hours of Chemical En-
gineering, you’ll stroll
over to your dad’s car
which you borrowed
for the day and discov-
er it to be missing.
This article from
1958 would have been
newsworthy if that had
been the entire story
but as it happens the
car was used in a vio-
lent robbery two days
later in Derby.
In 2007, another stu-
dent also found that
the area around Impe-
rial College isn’t always
as safe as you might
imagine. The Photosoc
member was held up at
gunpoint on Cromwell
Road in the middle of
the afternoon and had
over £300 of photogra-
phy equipment stolen.
The unlucky student
was kind enough to
provide a handy sketch
of the muggers for the
article (right). Another
reason to hate G-Unit.
