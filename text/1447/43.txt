Winner last week was Louise
Parchson, well done. This week’s one
should be a lot of fun. I’ve been told.
This puzzle is not as hotly contested
as all the others, so it’s a great chance
to pick up some much needed
FUCWIT points. GET ON IT YOU
NOBBERS.
Seen that special
person? Could be
the one? Want to
see them again?

“Why don’t you came and find out for
yourself. Remember, it’s not the mag-
nitude of the vector but the perpen-
dicular force that would determine
our moment. Not too deep mind, too
far and it may get clipped.

“You the soft spoken irish rugby
player. Me your rough and ready

“I called you daddy, you called me
son. I was being playful, but you were
being serious. I’ve always wanted to
try incest, but then maybe you were
being serious about being my real
dad. It is feasible. You’re 52 (wikipe-
dia) and I’m 21. Fancy a shag to see if
we finally feel like family?”
2nd year Biochemist
“Just horrific. Did you see how many
times you touched your cock in lec-
tures today? In truth, it turned me on.
Do it for me in private, and I’ll teach
you a thing or two. Probably two;
I have OCD and everything must
come in pairs.

“To any of the Gaelic men’s team.
They say Dublin is the mythical city
of drunken debauchery. Let’s test
that theory.
”
Any of the ladies’ gaelic team
“Looking for a Northerner. Wanting
someone who deep-fries everything
in sight for dinner every night, then
drinks his pint of extra smooth
bitter until he drunkenly falls into
a slumber. Willing to wear flatcaps,
support shit football teams and sur-
vive on a diet of pasties and chips.

“Looking for another pony to join
my lonely Shannon. Not sure how
we’re gonna get them together for
the Union lunch. Maybe they can
just share some Union carrots. ”
