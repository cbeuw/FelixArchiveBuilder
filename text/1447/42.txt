FRIDAY 04 DECEMBER 2009
Bloke on the bus: “I know you don’t understand. I don’t expect you to understand. It’s because you’re a woman.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,447
Solution 1446
I think we should reward double points on all
puzzles this issue, given it’s birthday week, so
go mental. Not like an American though. Well
done to Harry Potter Trio who managed to
fire a winning entry in Friday afternoon.
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to
Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters.
Complete the puzzle and
then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. You will not get credit
for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.

How to play:
Just like normal slitherlink ex-
cept cells now have 6 sides...
Variﬁed this half a dozen times
but if multiple solutions still ex-
ist then all are valid for points.

Solution 1446
his is a pretty swish one for our
birthday. You should be able to
work this one out for yourselves.
Well the winner of last week’s
was Absolute Cunt. Very ma-
ture choice of name that mate.
However also funny.

A long, poorly
written rant
CharlieMurdoch Coffee Break Editor

X
factor fuck off. Is this the
new Harry fuck-face Pot-
ter that is thrust upon us
and we’ve all been told
that we are going to hear
about it like it or not? Facebook is not
a place where I go to see pictures of
my mates pulling ladies, or vomiting
into a vomit pit. Either or, I’m equally
amused. I don’t want to join a group
about some nob trying to sing or X
factor related status updates. Mannish
updates like ‘Chris Baker-Brian had an
interesting journey home last night,
via Waterloo, Basingstoke and a £130
taxi ride to Surbiton!’ should be ac-
tively encouraged. On the bus home I
often fancy a browse of the day’s news.
I do not care if Jezward or whatever the
fuck those scrawny little BASTERDS
are called, have been voted off some
bollocks popularity contest. Good.
They should have not even been al-
lowed onto screen. Mate, you look like
a twat, if you want to resemble a twat
feel free to do this in your own time.
Get off of my TV, get out of my paper
and join the queue for the dole. As you
can’t sing and you can’t dance, or even
manage an attempt to hide this from
the rest of the world, I’m not going to
trust you with a broom. You’ll prob-
ably just shove it up your arse- not that
I’m against that, I just feel it a waste of
council money and that you’ll strug-
gle to actually sweep any streets with
it. It’s a bloody good thing that Robert
Palmer is no longer with us because
he’d have bottled you long ago.
Moving on. ‘I Celebrity Get Me Out
Of Here’. You what mate? You’re not a
celebratory really are you? No, so fuck
off. Nuff said. Join Jezward and get on
the dole. If you can’t do that just stay
in that jungle with all those Auzzies.
They’ll be overjoyed to see you, after all
they have a slightly dimmed outlook on
life. Why do you think they are all over
here working in our bars? That is, be-
lieve it or not, actually a step up for the
large majority of Australia. Unless you
are Kylie Minogue, which as you are
reading a free student newspaper, I am
going to assume that no, you are not.
I think I have outlined my feelings in
one of the most constructive ways, and
I feel considerably better. Well happy
birthday felix and watch this space
next week for more infomation on the
vomit pit situation. Currently the idea
is going round the upper circle of Un-
ion staff, and the reaction is said to be
‘mixed’. Well, that’s not a no then so fin-
gers crossed.
Stuff Imperial students like:
9. SCR Breakfasts:
Between 8.00 and 10.30 every
weekday something beautiful hap-
pens in that mysterious distant
utopia where your favourite lectur-
er eats lunch (stop staring at him
those glass windows are two-way
and he can see you!). Yes, you are
allowed into his sanctuary before
10.30!
They do a spiffing fry-up for less
than a fiver - less than £3 depend-
ing on how crafty/fatty you are!
Hung-over? Come out of a painful
9am lecture into the harsh daylight?
Head to SCR and feast with your
fellow sleepy peers and weirdos
who go to the gym before 8am.
The art and skill lies in deception.
It’s all about the order of choice. Ask
for bacon. Ask for beans. Never the
other way. The bacon is hidden and
you might not be charged! Ask any
shifty looking hockey player in the
SCR early in the morning to pick up
more tips and tricks.
Nom nom nom, only for external use
This week’s best of lol catz
