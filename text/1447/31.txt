A
few weeks ago when I wrote
this, the Christmas holi-
days didn’t feel as close, yet
I still feel the same- a trashy
holiday would be nice. To
go against the general eco, backpacker
view, sometimes it is good to just go
somewhere simply to enjoy yourself, and
I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Ideally far
away, expensive, and with time spent in
hotels, a non-culture holiday is brain and
body candy.
Expensive things are generally good,
but seem especially appealing as I just
managed to spend £30 on fish fingers and
Taboo vodka at Essentials-money seems
to be scampering away like a rabbit on
speed at the moment and I don’t want to
spend most of it on Admiral frozen food.
Far away would be nice too, as plane
travel has made everything so quick
nowadays that I often feel like I could be
still in England with the tiny time it took
to get somewhere. Crossing time zones
and spending more than a few hours on
a plane seems to make the escapism of a
holiday more real, at least to me.
Hotels are also good, mostly because
of the decadent fantasy atmosphere
they create, as long as you know to go
exploring and not stay encased in them
throughout the duration of your stay. A
bit of time drunk is always welcome too-
everyone wants to have fun, especially at
this time of year.
This got me thinking about Vegas.
Drinking age there is 21 so I would have
trouble in the drunk department, but
when I went there 2 years ago with my
uncle and brother it was the best in tacky
consumerism and pure entertainment, if
that is what you are looking for.
When I went, (with family) we stayed
in the Golden Nugget. This is one of the
most famous and old hotels in Vegas
(apparently you can visit it Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas). It has the world’s
largest gold nugget on display called “the
Hand of Faith”, and a lobby extends for
ages, eventually merging into casinos, 2
restaurants and a shopping street. Rooms
at the Nugget, and presumably elsewhere
in Vegas, have single beds the size of Eng-
lish doubles, extensive mini bars, good
views and mirrored ceilings (comical
considering the company I was with).
Defying global warming, carnival
lights are everywhere, and at every cor-
ner, men flick call girl cards at you (it is
illegal to actively publicize), advertising
“hot girls delivered to your room quicker
than a pizza”. I guess if you think about it,
pizzas have to be cooked, but the slogan
still sounds impressive. Dancing girls are
also famous from the time Vegas was
born- the more kosher side to female en-
tertainment. Gambling is a main attrac-
tion as well; $50, 000 chips are regularly
used at some poker tables, and a world
away from the topless guys playing the
same game knee deep in the Nugget pool.
This juxtaposition of wealth was in a way
kind of liberating, as it created an air that
anyone could live the elusive “American
Dream” and start playing those high val-
ue chips.
Sin also comes in liquid variety- peo-
ple happily walk down the street with a
collectible cocktail ‘bong’ from one of
the casinos, and seemingly every second
stop on the streets is a bar. To complete
the carnival theme, (not advised after
too many frozen margaritas) there are
rollercoasters in most of the casinos- my
favourites are the MGM Grand coaster
and the few up on the skyscraper; the
view from the top of the building is really
beautiful at night.
Vegas is in a desert, satisfying all heat
seekers with 110 Fahrenheit dry heat.
Actually, one out of the few times it has
snowed in Vegas was felix’s anniversary
year, where 12inches of snow fell on the
city on January. However the (normal)
heat means cabs have to be taken eve-
rywhere at midday unless you want to
die-a shame as some of old Vegas’ streets
are really lovely as you move away from
the corporate casinos; old Vegas is really
brilliant.
So even though I blatantly can’t go, it
still is nice to know that somewhere out
there people are having mindless fun in a
dust bowl in Arizona; Sin City is what it
says on the packet in almost every sense,
but it sure is fun.
Old Vegas, circa 1949: such a contrast to modern day Vegas with its elements of old-time Western towns.
