Tunes that thou listened to in 1949
Reviews
from 1949 Imagine the comments you would have
to put up with if your surname was
Hooker! It obviously didn’t get in the
way of John Lee Hooker, who achieved
moderate success with this song in
1949. His soulful vocals and twanging
electric guitar jamming are the per-
fect of example of what makes blues a
genre that has persisted all these years.
The lyrics mostly consist of “I’m a
hobo, gone long way from home”. I’ve
realised while doing these reviews, just
how much better black people were
at making music than white people
in 1949. All the white people music
sucks. – Alexandra Ashford
It seems as though, in the U.S.A. in
1949, everything was exactly like a
western film and everybody was a
cowboy and liked to listen to songs
that sound like steam railways with
whip crack and horse galloping sound
effects, and lyrics that mostly go,
“yeeeha, giddy up!”. I’m reviewing this
song but all the most popular songs of
1949 sound exactly like this. As crap as
it is, it’s about a million times more lis-
tenable than the current U.K. number
1 (Peter Kay’s Animated All Star Band
– Children in Need 2009 – by the way
that isn’t satirical, that really is the cur-
rent U.K. number 1 single.

According to music critics, this is the
best album released in 1949. It has that
completely unmelodic fidgety pulse of
bebop and I find it hard to imagine
anyone but the biggest jazz geeks lis-
tening to it. I can picture them now,
discussing in great detail the technical
nuances, what “cool” means, and ways
in which this album is unparalleled
genius. Personally, if I want to feel a
bit geeky, I’d rather just listen to Radio-
head. – Alexandra Ashford

I can imagine a really old couple

lieve this was the fourth biggest selling

This was pretty much Rhianna’s ‘Um-
brella’ of 1949; boring but still at
number 1 for an insane amout of time.
Number 1 throughout the world, this
ought to be the theme tune of every
cowboy as they ride into the sunset
howling ‘yipee-ay yay’. It’s definitely not
as bad as Rhianna... In fact I’ve learned
to like it, but nowadays it should only
be heard with its video accompani-
ment, trippy stuff. With the gallop-
ing horse sounds and honey voice of
Vaughn Monroe, it is the deserved
soundtrack to 1949. – Luke Turner
The iconic song from Edith Piaf, was
popularised in 1946 and chart topping
in 1949. Known as France’s greatest
popular singer, this was some of the
most influential on modern music to
come from 1949 – Luke Turner
EDITH PIAF
LA VIE EN ROSE

Rainy night. Warm coat. Silky voice.
A broken heart. Vic was the perfect
music. It really is on the boring side of
1949 but if depression over lost love is
what rocks your boat. – Luke Turner
Oh yes, 1949 was the year Rudolph hit
the big time in his musical form. This
has been the first x-mas song I’ve heard
this year which means I can’t say a bad
word. Not originally written by Gene,
it cruised to x-mas number 1, becom-
ing the second biggest selling x-mas
song of all time. Following this Gene
became known as ‘the singing cowboy’,
which doesn’t make a lot of sense, and
became the only person with 5 stars on
Hollywood. – Luke Turner
Okay so it wasn’t that long ago but seriously 1949’s music is pretty much unrecognizable, Alex Ashford reports

I
’m so glad I wasn’t around in
1949, because pretty much all
there was to listen to was jazz
(the musical equivalent of ama-
teur improv. drama shows) and
music that sounds like it is from a cow-
boy film. They hadn’t even invented
the keyboard yet, let alone synthesiz-
ers, mixers, autotune and music video
girls. The electric guitar was only just
being picked up on, and even then it
was for playing jazz. People had yet to
realize that playing in 4/4 as opposed
to 3/4 and 6/8 would create rock & roll:
the most popular kind of music since
the days of Beethoven and Mozart.
Despite not having the Cartoons, Pe-
ter Kay, or Wheatus, 1949 still saw the
release of some of the most annoying
songs of all time. Songs like “I’ve got
a lovely bunch of coconuts” and “All
I want for Christmas is my two front
teeth” are still remembered now, by la-
dies with a blue rinse in nursing homes
worldwide.
But not everyone listened to such
simple ditties. 1949 was the year Miles
Davis released his seminal album, “the
Birth of Cool”. And with that, jazz
became cool. It’s the jazz you smoke
cigarettes and drink red wine to in
New York bars. Trumpets were sweep-
ing exclamations over deep, deep, bass
tones, punctuated with the tingle of a
hi-hat and the snap of a snare drum.
This is the sort of music that you can
imagine listening to as you hang out
in dimly lit attics with characters like
Sal Paradise, taking now unknown
drugs and living just on the edge of the
Beat Generation. Miles Davis wasn’t
the only musical genius pushing jazz
in new directions. Thelonious Monk
invented bebop, the definitive sound
of the era. Lee Konitz released the
highly critically acclaimed bebop jazz
album, Subconcious.
However, the truth is, I know noth-
ing about jazz and for me to try to
write about it it’s like having an Aus-
trian, body-building, action movie star
governing one of the most influential
states of America. Oh wait... bad ex-
ample. But all I’m trying to emphasize
is how far removed I am, with the mu-
sic we have now, from what was being
played in 1949.
The amount music has changed over
the past 60 years is so unfathomable, I
wonder whether the same will be able
to be said in 60 years to come.
