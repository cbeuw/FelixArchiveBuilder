T
he population of the newly founded State of Israel surpassed
800,000 this month, but tensions remain with Arab neighbours.
The one-year old nation continues to grow as Jews from across
Europe and nearby Arab states immigrate to Israel. Earlier this
year, the country ended the Arab-Israeli war after defeating a
force assembled from several of its Arab neighbours, including Egypt, Syria,
Transjordan, Iraq and Lebanon, and signing an armistice in March. The vic-
tory has not only secured Israel’s independence, but also increased the land
under its control by almost 50% above what had been agreed by the UN parti-
tion plan passed two years ago.
This month, the Knesset, the legislative arm of Israel’s government, relocat-
ed from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem, which is still divided between the Israeli west
and Palestinian east. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion who was elected in
February continues to push ahead with his national policies of rapid develop-
ment and rising population by attracting Jews from across the world to Israel.

T
his week, two
million Nation-
alist Chinese
of the defeated
Kuomintang
(KMT) successfully retreated
to the island of Taiwan, leav-
ing only small pockets of re-
sistance to the communists on
the mainland.
The Chinese civil war is
coming to an end after years
of fighting between the nationalists and the communists which had resulted
over 1.2 million military casualties since the Japanese defeat at the end of
World War II. Civilian deaths amounted to many times this number. In early
December, Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT, proclaimed Taipei the tem-
porary capital of the Republic of China, and continued to assert his govern-
ment as the sole legitimate authority in China.
After a string of heavy defeats in north and central China earlier in the year,
and the communist capture of Nanjing, seat of the Republic of China’s gov-
ernment, the KMT were progressively repelled to the southern shores of the
country. In October, Mao Zedong declared the establishment of the People’s
Republic of China and moved its capital to Beijing.

T
he Berlin blockade ended three months ago after a hugely suc-
cessful airlift operation by the Allies, but over three month’s
worth of supplies have been amassed in West Germany, ensuring
that the airlift could be restarted with ease if needed.
The blockade, which lasted for a total of 18 months up until
September this year, saw a total of 2,326,406 tons of food and supplies deliv-
ered aboard 278,228 flights to Berlin by the USA and the UK’s RAF. The airlift
cost approximately $224 million, and saw over 100 fatalities, mostly British
and American, due to crashes.
The crisis was the first which resulted from tensions between the West and
the USSR after the end of the World War. The airlift commenced after the So-
viets blocked railways leading into West Berlin, in an attempt to force western
powers to allow the Soviet-controlled zone (East Berlin) to be allowed to start
supplying the western part of the city with food and supplies, effectively giv-
ing control of the city to East Germany.

P
rofessor Sir Leszek Borysie-
wicz, former Deputy Rector
of Imperial College and cur-
rent Chief Executive of the
Medical Research Coun-
cil, has been nominated as the next
Vice-Chancellor of the University of
Cambridge.
Professor Borysiewicz joined Impe-
rial in 2001 as Principal of the Faculty
of Medicine before becoming Deputy
Rector in 2004.
He is one of the country’s most re-
spected medical researchers, and will
commence his position at Cambridge
as the successor of Professor Alison
Richard at the end of her seven year
term on October 1st 2010. Professor
Borysiewicz will be the 345th person
to take this position at Cambridge, a
role which dates back to 1412.
Borysiewicz has a background in
immunology, infectious diseases and
vaccine development, and was knight-
ed in 2001 for his research which in-
cluded the HPV vaccine, now offered
to all girls to reduce the risk of cervical
cancer.
Prior to joining Imperial, he was a
professor of Medicine and head of the
department of Medicine at Cardiff
University.
Frank Kelly, Master of Christ’s Col-
lege, Cambridge, who was involved
in the search for the new Vice-Chan-
cellor, said that ‘’the university has a
history of academic excellence, built
upon first-class teaching and research
within its distinctive collegiate system,
and is in the top flight of research-led
universities worldwide. In its 800th an-
niversary year,’’ he continued, ‘’the uni-
versity has had much to celebrate from
its past achievements and its trans-
forming effect on lives and society, and
it looks to the future with confidence
and ambition.’’
Ex- Dep. Rector joins Cambridge
The professor has already experi-
enced employment at Cambridge, hav-
ing been a lecturer in Medicine as a
member of Wolfson College, of which
he is now an honorary fellow. Kelly
praised his efforts and said his ‘’wide
experience and outstanding personal
qualities equip him superbly to lead
Cambridge as a world leading centre
for education and research.’’ Professor
Alison Richard added that he is ‘’an
outstanding scholar with an impres-
sive record of achievement and leader-
ship at the highest level.’’
Borysiewicz commented on his
nomination and said he is ‘’delighted to
be nominated for the position of Vice-
Chancellor and excited by the oppor-
tunity to build on Cambridge’s strong
tradition of academic excellence in
both teaching and research.’’ The pro-
fessor was one of the scientists who
leapt to the defence of the principle
of ‘’unfettered advice without the fear
of reprisal’’ pending the controversial
sacking of government drugs advisor
David Nutt, which felix reported on
previously.
