Dan Wan Editor-in-Chief 2009-10
I
believe most of us reading this
will find it hard to even begin to
imagine what life was like as an
Imperial student in December
1949.
The campus, for one thing, would
have looked entirely different without
the current 60s-built monstrosities that
are the Sherfield, Huxley and Blackett
Lab. One building that has remained
in place, and in fact grown with Impe-
rial’s history, is the Union Building in
Beit Quad. Out of which rose felix, a
publication to “comment” and “bring
to attention” the issues and activities
of College life. These of which Pheo-
nix, Imperial’s long-standing literary
magazine, could not address due its
infrequent distribution.
Original Editor, E. M. Hughes, had
enough faith in the students of Impe-
rial College to invest his time in begin-
ning this paper 60 years ago; some of
his first words in felix made sure that
the students knew exactly that. “The
success or failure of this paper depends
principally upon you, our readers… we
depend on you to maintain a lively cor-
respondence in our columns.”
Though the first 600 copies of felix
sold out within the hour that morning
on the 9th of December, hindsight is a
wonderful thing, and especially hind-
sight taken from a such a distance as
2009’s felix. I like to believe that felix
has been qualified a success when put
in context of E.M. Hughes’ original mis-
sion statement. felix not only still unre-
servedly reports on College, but these
days, on its own Union too.
The cat has grown claws too sharp
and has become too fearsome to be edi-
torially caged by any institution.
This is a privilege gained by the work
of the thousands upon thousands of
students over these past 60 years. It is
an uprising of student voices that has
culminated in standards at which felix
and its editors run by today.
It has some poignancy in the fact the
very first issue contains the very same
message that I have been pushing this
year.
“Any contribution will be welcomed,
whether it be a full article on the mari-
tal customs of the Watussi or a chance
remark heard in the bar”.
I’m not sure anyone ever did cough
up an editorial on the marital customs
of the Watussi (we are still waiting), but
the message is still the same. Any piece
of writing that makes it down into our
office, in one form or another, is entirely
appreciated. We laugh with, laugh at
and learn from the authors of every ar-
ticle we receive. This year in particular
has been astounding in terms of contri-
butions. Each page of felix bursts with
several different by-lines, and as editors
we are having a hard time putting all
that we receive to print the same week.
We are slowly building a backlog of arti-
cles to go to print but it is problem that
also evidences how successful a student
newspaper felix as become in recent
years.
Amongst all the satirical laughter and
questionable humour (of which has
been questioned unreservedly), there is
an underlying yet prominent pride that
allows most Imperial students to be
glad to call felix their own.
Another issue that we must address
is that of the rumours surrounding felix
this week. On three separate occasions,
I have been bewildered by suggestions
that we don’t have enough money to go
to print this week.
I can truly say that these rumours
have no substance, and though I’m per-
sonally displeased with the idea that this
rumour is circulating College, it also
means people care about felix enough
to be bothered to ask.
I am proud to realise that felix runs on
its own revenue each week. As a student
newspaper, it means we are susceptible
to the blowing gales of recession. How-
ever, as we resist the toppling winds,
our feet are fimly on the ground. Any
situation to arise is still exactly that: to
still arise.
I am glad to say that felix’s reputa-
tion as an award-winning newspaper,
and also the newspaper that reaches
the eyes of approximately 12,000 Impe-
rial College students every single week,
has allowed us some financial pull when
other student newspapers would have
been forced to take mitigating action.
felix’s finances have been a long time
responsibility of every Editor past. The
work done is very much behind the pa-
per facade that is our weekly publica-
tion. Those that govern the paper’s fi-
nances have been kept up-to-date with
thecurrentsituation,andIamconfident
they still entrust me, as Editor, to moni-
tor felix editorially and administratively.
Keep the Cat free.
