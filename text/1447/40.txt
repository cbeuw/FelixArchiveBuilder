Drunken-mate photo of the week
xkcd.com
This guy just vommed out of a bus window – from the top deck. While he slept
on like a little drunken angel, several passers-by were in dire need of counselling.
Got a picture of
your mate being
an absolute waste
of oxygen? Well,
get your camera
out and email your
drunken-mate
photos to catnip.

What do you hate
most about medics?!
The rugby team. What a bunch of nancyboys - total
sausagefest!!! And they keep beating us too! It’s not fair!
Anonymous on the wing
They’re always complaining that they have so many lectures
and no time to do anything and then get totally boshed at
the reynolds and come home and wake up the entire hall! It’s
annoying - some of us are trying to have sex!
Mr and Ms. Anonymous-Smith
They strut about the SAF like they fuckin’ own the place!
Yeah, pennicillin, we GET it!!
2nd Year Bioscientist
They’re always busy hanging out with other medics...not that
I want to go out with them anyway!
Going to the Union
