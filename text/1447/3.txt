After lunch “Bo” was moved to the pavillion where
the Mayor’s tea was to be held. It was here that further
preparations were carried out for the return journey. This
tea was the high spot of the day and perhaps it was not
strictly true to say that all “Bo’s” crew and followers
were invited, but all attended in the true Imperial College
fashion.
During the tea it was learnt that “Bo” had been
disqualified for indulging in excessive speed. The day
was drawing into evening and the return journey had to be
faced. This was quite uneventful except that “Bo” was very
reluctant to forego further refreshments as were the crew.
The taxi-horn was used to full advantage whilst
the crowds in “Piccadilly” were given a fine exhibition of
circular motoring with Mr. Carruthers in the chair. Finally
the commissionaire at the Dorchester was allowed to use
his voice in order to stop “Bo” entering, so “Bo” reluctantly
returned to college, decidedly hot under the bonnet.
Letters to the Editor.
Sir,
In view of the ever increasing popularity of Saturday night "hops", and the impossibly
overcrowded conditions which are resulting, I feel we should tolerate no longer those men
from outside the college who seem to regard our Union as a Palais de Danse. Officials of the
Union should ensure that a responsible person is stationed at each door of the Union, not
the dance floor, who shall ask for the Union card of everyone who is not personally known
to him, and members of the College should evict with the utmost vigour and loss of apparel
any uninvited guest who does succeed in entering.
Yours etc.
Wallflower.
Sir,
It appears that there is a strange race in our midst. This body of men apparently
find it necessary to operate pneumatic drills behind the Albert Hall, whose neighbouring
buildings do nothing to muffle the shattering noise, at the ungodly hour of 7.30 a.m. when all
right minded people are abed, When the disturbed sleepers are eventually forced out of their
beds by thoughts of breakfast or the 10 o'clock lecture, a strange silence envelops the Hostel
precincts and the drills are stilled.
This, Sir, is beyond my comprehension. Can it be they bear us some malice?.
Yours etc.
D. C. Howe.
Dear Sir,
In a mild sort of way I would like to register a bitter protest about the Union beer.
Perhaps one of our own tame entomologists could recommend to our so called Brewers a
more virile type of Gnat.
Ulcerated.
Dear Sir,
The publication of Felix provides a long overdue opportunity for Union members to
express their views on many day to day items which would not normally find their way into
Union Meetings, and even for this alone it promises to be a most valuable organ.
Among many minor irritations a case on which I feel strongly is the price of
sandwiches in the New Lounge. That cakes should cost 3d is perhaps excusable. For those who
desired a less extravagant tea there were at one time many sandwiches at 2d and excellent
jam sandwiches at l½d. Now the sandwiches are as dear as the cakes and to choose a "cheap"
tea: is to face starvation.
In any case, Sir, can a charge of threepence really be justified for two thin half
slices of bread with a thin smear or ersatz compound between them?
Yours etc.
S.C.M.Taylor .
SPORTS REVIEW.
With this first issue of “Felix” it has been decided
to show readers the present position of the Colleges in the
sports field by giving a summary of the results of the three
principal winter games played throughout the Michaelmas
term. In subsequent numbers it is intended to detail the
previous fortnights activitiesin the whole range of college
sport – hostel residents will not with relief that the Sports
Editor is not himself a hostel-dweller!
Both the I.C. Hockey Club and the I.C. Soccer Club
have played matches in their respective London University
competitions within the last week, both being victorious from
the I.C. view-point. By the tim ethis has reached its public
the I.C. Rugby Club will have also played its Second Round
tie, with, it is hoped, equally satisfying results.
Results:

It is customary to blame cats for many antics on the rooftops and tiles, but we beg to report that Felix was not the “japer” responsible for the utilitarian
adornment on the Q.A.Dovecot on Morphy night.
It is reported, from a thoroughly unreliable source that the Astronomer Royal has been asked to be timekeeper in next year’s Morphy.
A pile of A.Sc.W. literature was recently found in the R.C.S. 1avatory . No comment.
