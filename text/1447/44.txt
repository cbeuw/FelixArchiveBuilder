PETER!!! So what did you get up to
Wednesday night then eh? Yes we
all saw you. And by we, I mean that
I saw, laughed and decided to mock

Anyhoo, Ruth, Peter is obviously

Aunty McPickle is a sorry sight
Dear Aunty McPickle,
The morning after my first anal esca-
pade with a random girl called Clara
O’Hara, which I have to admit was
quite a disappointment, very tedious
and exceptionally chaffing.
I was enduring the walk of shame
home, when I suddenly became
aware of a strange stinging sensation
under my foreskin. I quickly found
a dark alley and much to my horror
the cause was a whole piece of corn
lodged near my jap’s eye.
Should I abandon anal from now or
was this just a poor experience?
Sean O’Doherty
Dear Sean
This is pretty grim. I suggest you pre-
pare before embarking on the anal
scene again. Firstly ensure that if you
get back with this girl she hasn’t been
digesting corn or anything high fibre
for a few days. There’s two techniques
you could do; ask her to take a dump
before hand and narrow your chances
of infection, but this comes with mental
imagery and the fact that she actually
has to take a shit. Or you could just
brass neck it in there, might help if your
drunk senseless.
Good luck!

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have been working in a plus sized
clothes shop and have recently been
promoted to assistant manager, this
comes with many responsibilities
including bra fittings. Last week,
a rather engorged lady entered the
shop, followed by a vile penetrating
pong of BO layers, ranging from this
morning to about 3 years ago. She
was looking to get a bra fitting and as
the most senior member of staff the
task fell to me, much to the amuse-
ment of my colleagues.
I braced myself and led her tearfully
into the most ventilated fitting room.
I wanted to minimise skin contact so
asked her to lift her breasts up. This
was followed by a thud. On the floor
lay a whole piece of stale bread and
several cheese and onion crisps. I
am mentally scarred and haven’t
been to work since. Please help,
Josephine Russet
Dear Josephine,
You probably need to get a new job
or hunt her down and power hose her
until till she realises her effect on oth-
ers. This could be counted as GBH but
I’m sure the courts will understand (on
smelling) that technically its a favour.
Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
During last night’s epic sex mara-
thon, I was fucking her from behind
but she was getting a bit slack and I
was teetering on boredom. I thought
it’d be a good idea to donkey punch
her. She’s still unconscious in my
bed, what the hell do I do?
Jerry Bernett
Dear Jerry,
I think you should get her some medical
attention NOW! Blame it on a fall or
something, she’s sure to have forgotten
the sex you weren’t enjoying.
Good luck, I guess.
