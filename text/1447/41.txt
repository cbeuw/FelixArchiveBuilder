Putting the cat out to dry
You probably don’t know much about
felix and how it came about. In fact,
you probably don’t care about felix and
how it came about. Either way, it’s the
60th Anniversary and us editors now
have to theme our sections and pre-
tend we’re celebrating something.
1949
Dr Hubert Alfenstead, an Imperial re-
searcher in biological warfare created the
first Imperial student newspaper to pro-
motehisevilplans.Henamedthepaper‘Dr
HubertAlfensted’sevilstudentnewspaper’
.
What you’ve read in this paper up until now is complete bullshit. Here’s the real history of this dump of a paper
Anonymous Hangman Editor
The Beginner’s Guide to the history of felix
Two weeks later, Alfenstead was arrest-
ed for conspiracy to eradicate the human
race. He had manufactured a virus that,
as quoted from his student newspaper,
‘makes peoplereallyreallyangry.’Director
Danny Boyle later used this angry virus
as the premise for his 2002 film, ‘28 Days
Later’
.
When asked why he published his evil
plans for students to read, Alfenstead said
that to be truly evil, one must be openly
evil. He believed that Imperial students
deserved to know just how evil he was.
Alfenstead was sentenced to death by
hanging. It would seem that his open evil-
ness had cost him his life. However, he
famously escaped death by blaming it all
on the cat.
Alfenstead explained how his cat
felix, had held him at gunpoint and
forced him to synthesize the virus
and divulge the evil plans in a student
newspaper. The judge apologised
profusely and passed the sentence
onto Alftenstead’s cat. ‘Dr Hubert Al-
fenstead’s evil student newspaper’ was
then renamed to ‘Felix’ in honour of
his scapecat. (this witty take on the
word scapegoat would have been hi-
larious in 1949).
There is debate over where the name
felix, or the cat logo came from, but
hangman can assure you that this is
the correct story! Hangman was also
named after the hanging of Felix,
hence the picture above.
1965
The Sixties. A defining era that saw us
put our old english traditions aside and
welcome a colourful world of drugs,
casual sex and the Beatles.
It unfortunately also saw the rise in
feminism and women started to gen-
uinely believe that they could, well,
do stuff. This included reading and
writing.
In 1965, to the dismay of felix’s male
readers, the paper saw its first female
union.ic.ac.uk/acc/football
editor, Brigette Downs.
Downs started preaching her hippie
nonsense about world peace and start-
ed drawing flowers on every page in an
attempt to pacify any angry readers.
Flowers, up until this point, had al-
ways been regarded as masculine and
evil. Dr Alfenstead put flowers on
graves as an image of mockery. People
now do this as a message of respect.
The male population of Imperial re-
taliated against Brigette Downs with
the one thing they held dear to them
-felix. That’s right, they coiled up the
folded sheets of hippie jargon and
started beating the shit out of every fe-
male Imperial student.
The Great Felix Vagina Cleansing of
1965 saw Imperial College become a
male-only university. The Police force
even took inspiration and made trun-
cheons, akin to the rolled up newspa-
pers, to combat hippie protestors.
1979
You’ve just bought your microwave,
VHS recorder and first pair of Levi’s.
Nothing can get in your way. That is
until Maggie Thatcher comes along
and rules your country. Your VHS re-
corder has just been ruined forever.

LOL. Ur just jealous Gor coz ur prime minister
and ur not allowed to blow up trains
With a woman in power, it seemed
that Britain was really starting to accept
women as equals. Likewise, Imperial
College saw a rise, albeit a small rise,
in female students. The male-to-female
ratio has still not recovered from the
Great Vagina Cleansing of 1965.
On July 1st 1979, Thatcher contro-
versially tried to censor felix, worried
that its global influence was growing
out of hand. It has been speculated that
the Soviets invaded Afghanistan just to
try and out-evil Dr Alfenstead. This ru-
mour is yet to be confirmed.
felix stood firm, insisting that they
would always have freedom of speech
and would not be censored, ‘Keep the
cat free’. As a radical backlash and
show of power, felix decided to spon-
sor the Eighties. Yeah, that’s right - the
Eighties.
So before you pick up a copy of felix
and think it’s just an average student
newspaper. You remember that it was
once a symbol of evil, a weapon for
beating women and sponsor of the
Eighties. Felix the cat died for evilness
and every time you put flowers on a
grave you are insulting that cat and eve-
rything it stood for. Hangman is grate-
ful for your dedicated page skipping,
but does not tolerate ignorance. A cat
died for your rights.

STFU Osie! I cud blow up train if I want. I just
dont coz I’m not a knobhead rofl

We love hearing from the fans and have
received some really warm feedback
“Dear Hangman. I tragically lost my best
friend to the sport treeming, I’m glad that
you gave a serious guide to the extreme
sport and warned readers of the dangers ”
Someone who actually read last week’s
issue
“Dear Hangman. I’m currently writing this
from a US hospital ward. After reading
your guide to treeming, I thought I would
give it a go on my holiday to America.
Tiger Woods drove into me and I have lost
the use of my legs.” Amateur treemer
These lecture notes were generously
donated to hangman by ‘The second
year physics boys’. They insisted it
was printed in this weeks issue. God
knows why - fucking weirdos.
We hope that this detailed diagram
will help you with your differential
equations. If you feel that other
students would benefit from your
lecture notes, email them to us
