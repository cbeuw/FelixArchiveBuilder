An irregular romance for John Malkovich
A not-so-legendary film does no justice to an American legend
StefanZeeman
John Malkovich stars in Steve Jacob’s
new adaptation of the Booker Prize
winning novel, Disgrace by J.M Co-
etzee, which tells of the struggles of a
man and his daughter in post-apartheid
South Africa. John Malkovich plays se-
rial romancer Prof. David Lurie, who
teaches romantic poetry at Cape Town
University. Feeling lonely and unap-
preciated by his class, Lurie impulsive-
ly starts an obsessive relationship with
a reluctant mixed-race student, Mela-
nie. The relationship is swiftly revealed
although Lurie offers no defence to his
case. The words “your days are over
Casanova” are written on his black-
board, although the unfazed professor
leaves his post seemingly guilt-free. He
fancies himself to be an owner of a mad
heart instead of a corrupted mind.
The beginning could be con-
sidered a plot of a film in itself,
although it is only the starting point
for Lurie’s journey. Soon after, Lurie
leaves to live with his daughter Lucy,
who lives alone on a remote farm. Lucy
is the only woman Lurie can form a
connection with, and despite the obvi-
ous dangers of living alone, Lucy is im-
movable and proud of her land.
When three men suddenly attack
Lurie and rape Lucy at her farm,
their lives are uprooted
and the father-daughter
relationship is taken to a
new level. Lurie be-
comes obsessed
with conspir-
ing against
the
mysterious Petrus (Eriq Ebouaney)- a
man who lives and works on the farm.
Lurie is concerned with the lack of
boundaries that Petrus has around the
farm, and the relationship that he has
with one of the attackers. After the at-
tack, Lucy must rebuild her previously
untarnished world, and Lurie must
grasp the decisions that she makes
and adapt to an unfamiliar place. Lucy
wants to leave her past behind, claim-
ing it is a “private matter”, although
Lurie wants justice for what has hap-
pened to his invaluable daughter.
You can imagine that the fast paced
story would fill a book excellently, al-
though there is almost too much to
pack into two hours. Several important
moments are crammed into a few brief
scenes, so the characters’ development
is blunt. Saying that, it definitely con-
tains enough drama to keep you gripped
throughout the film, and South Africa’s
open landscapes provide a superb back-
drop to illustrate the exposed land. The
performances are absorbing, especially
John Malkovich, who produces a grip-
ping portrayal of a flawed man. Despite
the failures of Lurie, Malkovich forms a
character you can empathize with.
The film is shot tastefully, and the
characters give the powerful story an ex-
cellent backbone, although the portrayal
ofpost-apartheidSouthAfricaissome-
what rushed. Disgrace is an interest-
ing tale of a country trying
to rediscover itself after
the hurtful apartheid.
Lurie’s unforgiv-
ing approach to
the people he en-
counters is a good
indication of the
hopelessness in
the country.

Based on a true story, Amelia is a
non-fictitious, extraordinary story of
an extraordinary woman who tried
the impossible. And it stars Hillary
Swank, yes, the Oscar season is here.
But given the film’s quality, chances of
Swank scoring a nomination is looking
very unlikely, unless there are no more
decent performances from now until
around December/January.
Amelia Earheart was a pilot who ac-
complished many avian techniques
and broke many records as a woman
however she mysteriously disap-
peared over the central Pacific Ocean
whilst she was trying to complete her
circum-navigational flight of the globe.
She was the first person to fly solo be-
tween Hawaii and California, however
to modern viewers her disappearance
is possibly the only interesting thing
about her and most likely why she’s
actually famous. The film focuses on
various awards and titles that she won;
that and the occasional shallow/light
look at her love life with the publishing
tycoon George Putnam (Richard Gere)
and an aviation administrator Gene Vi-
dal (Ewan McGregor). By focusing way
too much on the dull, predictable ro-
mance and her extraordinary awards,
the film feels more like a detailed
documentary on Earhart’s life, whilst
never fully engaging the audience.
The film’s incredibly unsubtle Os-
car-baiting format is actually more
irritating than anything else. Grand
cinematography bombards the screen,
Hillary Swank puts on a funny accent
to imitate the flying legend and there’s
pompous music to emphasise the great
emotional challenge that Amelia
Earheart had to go through. The
film appears to be desperate
to snatch up some awards
by deluding the voters with
its technical beauty and
achievements, as it was never
going to perform too suc-
cessfully at the box-office.
Sadly, the film will probably
end up gaining neither.
It’s obvious to see
why Swank was
cast in this dis-
mal biopic. She’s
an excellent
actress and
also resem-
bles the
late legend
but even she
can’t salvage this messy script and
direction. The narrative is repeti-
tive and confused, and doesn’t know
whether it wants to be a doomed ro-
mance film or a dull biographical film
that tries to squeeze in as many of
Earhart’s achievements in the shortest
running time as possible. Either way,
this project wasn’t going to startle the
viewers in any way.
Amelia is a lazy attempt to gain
some Os-
JohnPark car love. Who knows? It may get some
nominations. But I hope they’re all in
the technical department. The scenes
involving old-looking, beautiful planes
are definitely impressive, the period
costume is always an Oscar favourite
and the score fits the adventurous style
perfectly. The cast is fantastic, but
looking at the film
as a whole, it’s a
complete waste
of talent. Swank,
Gere and Mc-
Gregor deserve
so much better
than this.
Competition
We have four
free tickets for
Mascarades to give
away!
Mascarades is showing at the Ciné
Lumière as part of their French Film

Ho Kong was the winner of the com-
petition we ran three weeks ago but
we forgot to publish it! The correct
answer was of course “La Vie en
Rose”
Apologies
John Malkovich apologies once again for harrassing his wife for shower sex
ing Lucy. A graduate from the Univer-
sity of Cape Town, gaining a degree in
social anthropology, she has travelled
throughout Africa, making her an ideal
candidate for the role. J.M Coetzee, the
author of the book, grew up in a South
Africa under apartheid and left before
the apartheid ended, which means he
presumably left with somewhat twisted
feelings towards the country, similar to
the awkward (and probably intentional)
taste that’s left in your mouth at the
end of this film.
