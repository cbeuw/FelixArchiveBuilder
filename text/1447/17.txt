RAG gets Lost... Somewhere-shire...
RAG has had its first large-scale
event of the year with a great degree
of success. Alex Dahinten, the RAG
Chair shares some details of the event
with felix.The idea of the event was that
you get put on a bus and with a blind-
fold on, driven to a top-secret location
in the absolute middle of nowhere and
eventually make it back to the Union
without spending ANY money. The
teams were comprised of groups of ei-
ther two or three, with at least one guy
in each team (no this wasn’t an Imperi-
al law; it was mostly to do with safety).
The big question raised was to do
with how money is raised. Simple, Alex
said; through funding! Once signed up
to the event, participants were given
access to the website “JustGiving”.
Once the account was set up, they were
able to harrass their family, friends and
anyone they knew into sponsoring
their stunt. To make things more in-
teresting, some teams decided to wear
fancy dress. One team even dressed up
as three Tic-Tacs! Some teams also de-
cided to set goals for amounts of mon-
ey raised. Depending on the amount of
money raised they would perform cra-
zy tasks or wear something ridiculous
like a leotard or speedos. Given the
pictures below, goals were definitely
reached and exceeded.
Prizes were awarded to different
teams for different reasons:
- Most outrageous mode of
transportation
- Most money raised
- Best or most imaginative
costume.
RAG saw the event as an opportunity
to show that the organisation has be-
come a seriously active and engaging
one once again. RAG has held several
smaller events before Lost that have
been popular and this is sure to con-
tinue, including the hugely successful
Sports Night held in conjunction with
the RCSU. The string of great events
that students love is bound to continue.
A
fter visions of being
dropped off in bandit
country (aka the north)
we were pleasantly
surprised that we had in fact
gone to the lovely southwest.
Our first job after we were
hurled off the bus in a Guantan-
amo Bay-style hood was to es-
tablish where we actually were.
Unfortunately Iwan had other
ideas and made a beeline for
the nearest sheep. After a short
time Iwan had cleaned himself
up and we had established with
a miffed lorry driver - not even
remotely aroused by the three
sexy men in drag - and we were
near Salisbury near Wiltshire.
With that milestone achieved
we headed to the nearest pub
for some light refreshment and
to formulate a plan. The plan
mainly consisted of discussing
the various merits of the bar-
girls, who were lovely and eating
a fine lunch.
After sinking a few jars and
chinning a few gins we set off
home. As we left the Pub the
local plod turned up, having re-
ceived word of the Welshman’s
antics. After a bit of police bru-
tality (they got out of their-
car) and some argy bargy
(took a photo) we had se-
cured
a lift
to
Salisbury.
During this journey
we found out that there is a local
tranny who kicks around the car
parks which explains why the
lorry driver thought he had seen
us before. After arriving in Salis-
bury we tried in vain to hitch a
lift with passing motorists. They
clearly were not impressed by
Tom’s or my efforts and mainly
gave us the finger. Thankfully
a delightful woman on her way
back from her shopping offered
to take us to the next service sta-
tion on the motorway.
On arrival it was noted that
several police cars and a fire en-
gine were arranged around the
forecourt. Turns out the place
had been ramraided and we had
just missed out on a potential
standoff. Good times.
So onto the next service sta-
tion. As we arrived, a Ford Mus-
tang pulled up and we thought
hell lets ask for a lift. Fortunately
the driver was a Lad and offered
to take us right into London.
Sure enough as any lad does
he sank some snakebites and
necked a bird before setting off.
We sped down the motorway
at around 100mph, and arrived
in London in good time. From
here we took a helicopter/tube
train for free back to the union.
All in all a lovely day out in the
countryside coupled with a ride
in a super car. Not bad
really!
Yup, we’re going to die out here.
I was looking for the Fake Treasure but got Lost!

Desert share their experiences
