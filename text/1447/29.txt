D
uring the Second
World War, cloth-
ing factories were
reserved for mak-
ing parachutes and
uniforms. Due to the
shortage of material and factory work-
ers, clothes rationing started in 1941
and lasted for 8 years.
At the time, everyone in the house-
hold was given a booklet of coupons
to exchange for clothes. People had
to go to a shop, present the appropi-
ate number of coupons and money in
exchange for any items from shoes to
pyjamas. For men and boys, an over-
coat was worth 16 and 11 coupons; for
women and girls, a dress would cost
them 11 and 8 coupons.
To prevent people from using up all
the coupons in one go, the booklet was
divided into colour catego-
ries. From time to time,
the government would
announce which col-
our to be used in the
period.
Instead of hitting the
shops for new clothes,
the government also is-
sued a book called
‘Make Do and
Mend’ to encour-
age women to re-
pair broken items.
Old curtains could
be made into a new
coat; dated jump-
ers could be re-
knitted into some-
thing new. Petrol
was also rationed
during the war,
hence make -up
also became
one of the most
luxurious of all
luxury items.

After a deal with New Look and
a stationery line with Smythson,
Giles Deacon has designed another
exclusive online collection deal for the
online retailer thecorner.com.
On sale are three pieces from Giles’
resort collection that have been
created in exclusive fabrics.
The business savvy designer, who
moved to show in Paris a season ago,
will remain in Paris for the foreseable
future because orders for his
collection have increased dramatically
since his arrival on the Paris scene.
Fashion commentators Brenda Polan
and Roger Tredre have brought out a
new book which will aim to answer
the question “who are the great
designers?” The book documents
the top 50 designers that the authors
thought willing to grace the pages of
their new literary must have.
Roland Mouret, in partnership with
Browns has launched a power mesh
dress that allows the wearer to get
the Mouret shape under her favourite
dress. The slips not only give a woman
the perfect shape, but also is bang on
trend as the must have sheer slip dress
for summer.

duction in supply. Women would get a
friend to draw lines at the back of their
legs to mimic the seams. In the most
extreme cases, some even painted their
legs with gravy – which on a hot day
could attract flies to their bodies.
Two years before the clothes ration-
ing ended in 1947, someone burst onto
the fashion scene and transformed the
perception of fashion for good. His
name was Christian Dior, a political
science student who served in the war
and eventually became a designer. His
first collection had such a great im-
pact in the fashion world – his clothes
were feminine, youthful and sensuous
- a huge contrast to the modest civilian
war time outfits.
Harpers Bazaar branded his designs
the ‘New Look’. Today, 1950s fashion is
still known as the ‘New Look of Chris-
tian Dior’.
The New Look accentuated a wom-
an’s curves while maintaining the
clothes’ functionality. The 2-piece suit
featured a cinched-waist, large shoul-
ders and a full calf-length dress.
In an age where turn-ups on trou-
sers were banned to save materials,
a full Dior New Look would use
up 10 yards and sometimes up to
80 yards of material. To achieve the
fullness of the skirt the wearer may
require a petticoat underneath to
create a buffon look.
This lavish use of material
had made the reincarna-
tion of this New Look im-
possible across the English
Channel when the cloth-
ing rationing was still in
place. Jane Brostein, the
founder of
The presence of fashion’s past
Browns, famously had to save up cou-
pons in exchange for one of the New
Look dresses. Nonetheless, it was Dior
who had started this new era of fash-
ion. Fashion was no longer a mere ne-
cessity in life – it became an art form,
something glamourous and admirable.
The 1950s were the Golden Age of
fashion. The dull civilian war-time
outfits were suddenly a thing of the
past. Balenciaga, Balmain, Schiarparel-
li and Dior created the effortless and
chicness popularised by Grace Kelly
and Aurdrey Hepburn. Their looks
consisted of a plain black blouse with
a ballerina A-lined skirt or a swoop
line full length dress is still an all time
classic in fashion history. Hussein Cha-
layan’s AW09 collection featured re-
interpretation of the swoop line dress
with a raised side slit and reinforced
shoulders. The 1950s is an era in fash-
ion that will never be forgotten.
Soon the Parisian society of the 50s
moved on to something even more
glamourous for the hedonic post-war
days. Evening dresses were in high de-
mand for dinner parties. Haute Cou-
ture continued to grow, reaching al-
most 3000 private clients across Paris.
Ostrich feathers, rare stones, genuine
pearls and a wide variety of appliques
were handsewn by in-house ateliers,
sometimes taking up to 200 man hours
for a dress.
Coco Chanel understood the appeal
of fashion, which is always about new-
ness. She realised the limits of the ex-
clusivity of Haute Couture and her new
approach to clothes-making would
eventually morph into the ready-to-
wear collections we see today.
When Coco Chanel reopened her
boutique on 31 Rue Cambon in 1954,
she was determined to change the
cinched-waist look. Chanel’s Upper
East Side uniform was born. Boxed
shape jacket with a straight waist
and a knee length skirt in a
rich textured boucle.
The 50s also
marked the birth of fashion shows.
Fashion shows were strictly a thing
for the royalties, nobles and the rich.
They would be invited to an exclusive
location and be seated around a round
table in a ballroom. Men chatted away
and smoked cigars; women in expen-
sive jewellery and clothes would sit and
watch the models coming out from a
backdrop. Fashion shows were less of a
theatrical show then. Models casually
walked along the centre of the room –
not on a runway – to demonstrate the
clothes. Dior’s first collection was se-
cretly shown to Queen Elizabeth at the
French embassy.
60 years later, the mood of war is
back. Some of the wartime classics are
reinvented by many fashion houses,
most notably the double-breasted
wool coat as seen at DNKY, Michael
Kors, Louis Vuitton and Prada that
boasts functionality.
Alber Elbaz of Lavin and John Gal-
liano of Dior both revisited the archive
and brought back the post-war ladylike
skirt suit. Christian Dior’s debut clas-
sic is retouched to include a mid-body
leather belt and a dropped neckline.
Some designers were being more
optimistic. The runways of Balmain,
Gucci and Marc Jacobs demonstrated
a more frivolous mood. The glitter of
sequins and the flourescent colours
possibly reflect the hopes of these de-
signers that by winter, the financial
woe will be over and everyone will be
raising their champagne glasses again.
Worries will never cease to haunt us.
Another tornado is tearing through
the money markets in the shape of a
6-star sail shaped hotel. Lloyd’s TSB is
in trouble again, everyone in the city
frowns and businesses are pondering
their future with the market in another
wave of distrust. This is why fashion is
a sanctuary to all. Fashion never sulks,
it is always glamourous and fun. The
simplest form of escapism is at hand to
all of us – leave the real world behind
for a minute or two. Let’s indulge our-
selves in another dose of fashion.
