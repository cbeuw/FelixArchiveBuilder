coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk COFFEE BREAK
Horoscopes: star-signs like it’s nineteen forty-nine!
It’s felix’s birthday and I’ll cry if I want to... tears of tobacco straight into your pipe in the Ministry of Love
Cancer
You’re developing a
rash down there. You
wait a few days and
it’s just about to fall
off. Well, better finish
the job, my son; it’s a
bad case of knob-rot. Teaches you to stick it into
the caverns of the Southside Slut, Beit Bicycle,
Garden Gash and even a ride on the Wilson willy.
Virgo
It’s your Christmas
dinner this week.
Your SocialSec
fucked up and you’re
all at KFC. You
still manage to get
bungalow-ed and can’t make eye contact with
the cat across the street for a while. Well played!
Gemini
The TV’s angry at
you. The fridge won’t
put out. The banana
saw what you did and
is attending counsel-
ling sessions. Bitter
and lonely, you invest in a Fleshlight. Surely now
you will be happy! But it’s too tight to get it in.
Pisces
You wake up in the
morning slightly
concerned by
your missing Fluid
Mechanics text
book. Never mind,
the notes on the inside cover in unlawful sex
positions can only boost your grade....
Leo
It’s not your birthday.
You’re not upset.
You have a super-evil
plan on how to take
over the world with
a cheeseburger. But
your computer keeps
breaking. Pooh you!
I’d say chin up but there’s a milk storm due to hit.
Aries
You meet a shadowy
character whilst buy-
ing your sandwich.
They ask if you want
a candle with your
order. You joyously ac-
cept. Little do you know you’ve just been framed
for the murder of Colonel Sanders in the library!
OMG! YOU KILLED KFC! YOU BASTARD!
Scorpio
Walking out into
the street you sense
someone watching you.
You turn around and
glimpse your lecturer
run. I advise you stay
on guard and keep your
hands permanently
behind your back protecting your bumhole.
Libra
ACC! You’re
practically creaming
yourself. All those hot
horny jock freshers
grinding their sweaty
bodies up against
each other. Be careful though, they might have
chlamydia! Oh, you have creamed yourself. I’ll
get you a tissue. No, I won’t stroke your hair!
Taurus
Having watched
Imperial shit
diarrhea all over St
Hugh’s, you develop
a huge crush on one
of the IC team. You
add him on FaceyB,
you send him a dildo
but he ignores it all. I love dildos.
Capricorn
You create a pretentious
music album based on
the book 1984. It flops
but there’s one girl who
thinks it’s completes
genius. She leads you to
a secluded spot in the woods. All hell breaks loose
as you stick your fingers in and you realise her
vagina has teeth. You put your penis in. Pint?
Aquarius
Again you can’t fight
that feeling you’re
a waste of space.
Guess what - you’re
right! Yes everyone
would be much
happier if you hadn’t
been born. Someone
should have sterilised both your grandfathers.

Sagittarius
You make a booty call
on your birthday but
there’s an odd turn
as they weep into
your genitalia. You’re
not sure if you mind
though, the slippier the better! You give them a
hard arse slap and a crotch rub as a goodbye. Give
and take baby. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! xXx xXx xXx
In case you’re one of those people that
flip straight to Coffee Break, firstly, you
have excellent taste, and secondly, last
Saturday, was LOST. It was epic. Our
50 RAGgers were picked up in the Un-
ion at 9 am in costumes ranging from
giant tic-tacs to teddy bears, carted
onto a coach, blindfolded and dumped
on the side of a road about 5 miles from
Salisbury, with nothing more than a ra-
zor, lollipop and a condom.
Most teams managed to make their
way back, either by hitchhiking, blag-
ging free train or coach rides or getting
picked up by a group of squaddies. We
did, however, have one lovely group
who managed to strand themselves
in Southampton. As promised, LOST
HQ sent out two very noble committee
members willing to sacrifice their Sat-
urday night in a Union minibus down
the long M3 on a cold, wet winter’s
night to pick up the tutu-clad aliens
from Southampton Central Railway
Station.
All in all, however, the event was a
great success, having raised almost
£4000 all for Barnardo’s!
RAG kidnaps 50 students and dumps bodies in Wiltshire
Also coming up our two carolling
events! Today (Friday 4th December)
we’re going to Green Park with the
Imperial Chamber Choir, and next
Monday (the 14th of December) we’ll
be with the Main Choir on the Main
Stage in Trafalgar Square beside the gi-
ant Christmas tree! Both events are in
support of Great Ormond Street Hos-
pital in Bloomsbury.
So as always, if you want to get in-
volved with any upcoming events
we’ve got planned, just drop us a line at
rag@imperial.ac.uk. To read more about LOST, see page 13
