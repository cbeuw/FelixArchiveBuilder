Most Listened
to this week
I
first heard “The Quiet Things
That No One Knows” when I was
a hormonal 16 year old, and boy
did I love it! At that stage I had
no idea how it would change my life,
I just thought the guitar in the chorus
sounded really cool! “Okay, I Believe
You, But My Tommy Gun Don’t” was
the second song I heard from this al-
bum that day and I was blown away.
I thought both songs were really
cool, but back then I thought LOTS
of songs were pretty cool and the
plethora of bands I should listen to
was so massive that to buy every single
promising album would have cost me
roughly a year’s worth of EMA pay-
ments (I worked it out). So luck made
me buy this album with the strange
picture of an astronaut on the cover.
The first track, “Tautou”, was quiet
and a little bit spacey and I initially
thought the lyrics were repetitive
and way too weird. I was worried. I
thought I had bought a dodgy album.
And then I heard “Sic Transit Gloria...
Glory Fades”.
That bass line, wow! I mean WOW!
It left me rooted to the spot. I felt that
a very horrible concept (like that of
electron-hole pairs) was careening
straight for me and there was nothing
I could do to stop it. The feeling is de-
licious, since this song tells the story
of two people. The loss of the boy’s
virginity is allegorised as a lamb being
taken to slaughter, so a feeling of any-
thing other than the most oppressive
doom would devalue the lyrics.
I had grown up listening to KoRn,
Limp Bizkit and Slipknot, so the over-
whelming use of acoustic-y sounding
guitars did weird me out somewhat!
But the sheer arrogance of the lyrics “I
Albums that you should know
am Heaven sent” and the insane over-
lay of voices in “The Quiet Things…”
had won me over by the end of track 5.
I have enjoyed every track on this al-
bum, but space is limited and I would
like to talk briefly about the final
track, “Play Crack The Sky”. The folk-
feel and constant referencing to the
sea gives the song an intimate “fish-
erman’s story” feel. A beautiful, yet

elebrating its 10th year as an
independent label, Bristol’s
much beloved Tru Thoughts
released a 3-CD “best of”
compilation last month showcasing
the vast talent they have accumulated
over the years. Considering that back
in 1999, founders Robert Luis and Paul
Jonas started the label from an “office”
under Luis’ stairs, they haven’t done
too badly over the last 10 years.
Along the way they discovered great
artists such as Bonobo or Chris Clark
– who later moved on to bigger labels
Ninja Tune and Warp, respectively
– and they still play host to the ever-
prolific Quantic, in his many shapes
and forms, the genre-hopping Nostal-
gia 77, or Australian super-heavy funk
combo The Bamboos.
The reason Tru Thoughts has be-
come a label of guaranteed quality in
the sweetest of all grooves on display
here, punctuated by tight horns and
sexy saxes.
For all the Tru Thoughts fans, this is
an essential addition to the collection,
clearly portraying how the label got to
where it is today: by signing artists who
are not afraid to take risks, break down
a pop song, and jazz it the fuck up.
To anybody who has not heard of
Tru Thoughts – or worse still, thinks
that jazz has been dead a long time –
this might be the perfect introduction.
An album bursting with creativity and
a crash-course in reinvention.
Bad-ass jazz covers, cheers Tru Thoughts
today’s over-saturated musical world
is most definitely down to their will
to constantly reject the old saying that
the music business is “99% business,
1% music”.
Tru Thoughts love the artists that
they sign, and they let them know it by
releasing this compilation of crossover
covers by Tru Thoughts acts.
The 17 tracks are either B-sides or
exclusive tracks from the past 10 years,
collected for the first time here. For-
get whether you have heard of the Tru
Thoughts roster: some of these are sim-
ply adventurous, hilarious and down-
right outstanding covers of songs eve-
ryone else has grown tired of by now.
Think you’ve heard the White
Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” so much
your ears bleed? Think again, you ain’t
heard it like this. The amazing Alice
Russell, backed by Nostalgia 77, deliv-
ers a powerful soul version of this rock
classic, morphing it into a dark, dou-
ble-bass heavy beast in its own right.
Quantic and his Combo Barbaro
give a steaming afro-cuban rendition
of Portishead’s depresso-matic tune
“Wandering Star” that’ll give Beth
Rowley something to really cry about.
Hot 8 Brass Band turn up the heat
yet more by giving Marvin Gaye’s “Sex-
ual Healing” a smooth jazz-makeover,
putting you in the right mood for lovin’.
The diversity of the label’s acts is al-
ways on display: J. Viewz turn Michael
Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” into a
trip-hop song, and Jumbonics funk up
the Strokes on “Last Nite”.
My personal favourite has to be the
most improbable cover of “Put Your
Hands Up For Detroit” ever imag-

dancefloor hit to the next level with

sad story detailing the decay and sud-
den end of a relationship caused by a
mindless comment.
And that’s what I love about this al-
bum, the lyrics tell stories. The stories
deal with real issues which we will all
at one point have to cope with. I can
still listen to it (nearly six years later)
and understand a song in a different
way.

I want to make it clear right
now that I have absolutely
nothing to do with this
chart. I don’t believe you
care what other people you
don’t know are listening to,
and neither do I. Knowing
that so many people are
listening to Coldplay is a
sad truth I’d rather not
have known. - Alex
A
ghostly night of picturesque
folk beauty, peace and a
touch of Leonard Cohen,
was what I was unaware of
as I departed to a dark corner of Kil-
burn where nestled The Luminaire. It
was not the night for me to riot to indie
distortion or break my ears with the
frequencies of bass, however, I was a
virgin to Musee Mecanique and Laura
Gibson and was prepared for anything,
and so took the step from the icy street
into The Luminaire.
Speechlessness was my first feeling
when I got inside and Musee Meca-
nique had just broken the quiet with
their first song. The small black and
velvet red venue was completely silent
apart from the gentle acoustic guitar
and hum of the keyboard from the duo
on the stage, Musee Mecanique. There
was a large handful of people all sat
on the floor infront of the pair, almost
nobody standing, the atmosphere was
exactly as it should be. Although the
music played, you could have heard a
mouse, and the people were complete-
ly focused on the sound being made,
just as it is meant to be.
Musee Mecanique played soft music,
with gentle talented voices. At times
endearingly out of tune, this seemed
unimportant as the vibe of the room
saw past this, as if they were having a
soul-to-soul with us, truly showing us
emotion.
The pair had an unbelievable musi-
cal connection as they paused and
continued flawlessly. Taking a change
of instruments they both play guitar,
one acoustic and one classical and be-
gin by performing minutes of gentle a
Musee Mecanique & Laura Gibson @ The Luminaire
Luke Turner believes in ghosts after a night at The Luminaire
capella in beautiful tune and harmony.
The skill of these musicians can’t be
doubted, each playing more than one
instrument at once on occasion. Leav-
ing the stage humbly the room was left
whispering, this was a new take on folk
music for me.
I was impatient to hear what Laura
Gibson was to add to this formula and
by this time the entire floor was filled
with cross-legged spectators. She ap-
peared on stage as a ghost-like figure,
vintage white dress and pale, she was
followed by Musee Mecanique who
were to accompany her set. She gently
plucked her acoustic, with keyboard
and various stringed instruments be-
ing played by her aides. Not only did
the image on stage appear ghostly, the
sound was calm and peaceful, it was a
transfixing scene. Her music was slow
and played with feeling, her voice was
sweet and there was real fluid con-
nectivity of all the sounds being made,
some echoing others, some giving res-
onance, flowing with the smoke rings
of my mind, it fitted serenely. Some
of her songs had pretty two-vocal
parts, but her melodies seemed to lack
direction.
She sweet talked the crowd between
songs that otherwise would have
blended together, and towards the
end of her set the atmosphere was a
dream world. Her lyrics seemed to be
personal, as if it was surreal story time
and we were her children. She ended
her set with a Leonard Cohen cover of
‘Take This Waltz”, humble, as she knew
few people knew her own music. She
left us graciously with folk spirit in our
minds.
