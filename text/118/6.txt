It is fitting this term to writs an
aooount of the Musical Society for at
the moment we are witnessing an unpre-
cedented interest i n music ma king
throughout the College.
Our activities may he divided into
five groups. The Choir, Orchestra,
Gramophone Library, Gallery Parties and
Lunch Time Recitals, claiming a member-
ship of between 150 - 200.
I.C. Choir i s better known outside
khe College than i n i t , a reproach we
hope will be rectified on March 12th
when we are to give Bach's Mass in B
minor i n yiieen Alexandra's House.
this i s the Choir's most ambitious
work yet attempted, and we are proud
to announce that Yfrah Neaman will lead
the Orchestra. The leading solo trumpet
will be George Eskdale. Dr. Brown i s
not the person to allow his choir to
lag behind these celebrities and has
welded the varied talents of the members
into an excellent team, We often hear
the argument "
W
h
y hear amateurs i n
London?" - If you can t e l l the difference
between the present choir and profession-
als, you are likely to known enough about
music to oome i n any case.
The College Orchestra shewed i n i t s
performance a fortnight ago that i t has
improved a great deal over the last
year end the lively music of "the Mi kado
should enable them to shew their talents
on March 17 - 20th.
The Gramophone Library is at pres-
ent hardly able to oope with i t s many
customers. We hope to expand i t when
space and money permit.
Gallery Parties are open to a l l m
e
m
-
bers of Imperial College, whether m
e
m
-
bers of the Musical Society or not. I f
their popularity increases we will be
able to take over the gallery at Cevent
Garden or Sadlers Wells;nearly half the
gallery audience for Rigoletto last
Wednesday were from Imperial College and
we had to turn students away.
Finally our Lunch Time Recitals
which fipmr in the General Studies pro-
gramme have Just passed their 200th
performance.
These recitals started before Gen-
eral Studies were heard of and have con-
tinued ever since. The Musical Society
is grateful for the opportunity of bring-
ing some of Britain's foremost performers
to Imperial College. We only wish more
people would avail themselves of the
chance to hear them.

The extension until 6.30 of the
meal service in the Upper Refectory has
not diminished the queues downstairs.
As fast as the facilities are improved
more and more people take advantage
of them. 250 to 300 suppers were
served daily at the beginning of last
term — this number h*« now doubled.
Complaints have been received about
the slowness of the service upstairs:
this i s due to the inadequacy of the
servioe l i f t , which Mr. Mooney sug-
gests should be modified to carry one
passenger with a trolley, and to the
appalling telephone communication be-
tween the floors. The telephone has
broken down ten times this year; the
contractors - Siemens - blame i t on
heat, believe i t or not. The Chair-
man of the Refectory Committee, Prof.
Newitt, observed that ships' tele-
phones withstood temperatures of 130
to 140° F. This matter i s going to
be rectified.
Some reorganisation has been sug-
gested for the kitchens, which were
designed to serve 800 lunches and are
now turning out 1000. It involves
putting a door in the wall immediately
behind the cash desk, roofing in the
small area, tiling the walls and form-
ing a proper floor, and making an
opening from this area into the vege-
table preparation room. The Staines
Dish washing machine at present in
use i s nearing the end of its useful
l i f e , and i t would be replaced by a
'Hercules' appliance. (At the moment
the washing-up after lunch i s not
finished until 5 o'clock.) The cost
of this reorganisation is estimated
at about £1,900, nearly half of which
would be for the 'Hercules'.

AT 10 th. MATCH
At the meeting of the Refectory
Committee held on February 14th., much
discussion was devoted to the facilities
to be afforded to conferences e t c that
are held in the College, and to sugges-
ted improvements in the movement of
dirty crockery from the refectory and
the washing up facilities.
100 competitors in the Empire
Games are to be accommodated i n the
hostel from August 2nd to the 5th. or
8th. As usual the Union will be closed
during August, but i t was felt that
some dining facilities should be
available to the visitors. If the
refectory i s kept open for the first
week i n August, i t will lose £250,
an alternative being to serve breakfast
only at five or six shillings a head,
in which case no 1 oss would be suf-
fered. The refectory would be looked
off from the rest of the Union build-
ing.
The student members of the Com-
mittee objected to the use of the
Concent Hall for conferences. The
Union was being used as a convenient
social unit for the benefit of out-
siders, whereas i t was intended for
students only. They should be en-
couraged to use the refectory and com-
mon room in the Ayrton Hall, and a
minute to this effect was recorded.
The small dining-room on the third
floor of the Union i s being furnished
at a cost of £167. It will be suitable
for small dinner parties of up to 16
people, and for the staff to use for
"business lunches.* Some argunent
arose on the question of booking, the
Domestic Bursar asserting that "
m
e
m
-
bers of staff do not want to come to
the Union to book the room." Mr.
Chadwiok pointed out that members of
staff ought to be members of the
Union also; he did not see why they
should not book at the Union office.
It is to be hoped that some face-sav-
ing agreement will be reached.

Thirty-one drivers entered last
Friday for Guilds Motor Club's annual
night rally, the first since November
1955. The first oar was away at 9.15
p.m., and headed north into Hertford-
shire. The rally was in three sections,
the first involving a run out to En-
field , followed by a somewhat search-
ing test of map-reading ingenuity which
daunted at least one very prominent m
e
m
-
ber! The section ended with an easy
cross-country run to a desolate gravel
pit at Codicote.
The second section was a kind of
treasure hunt: fifteen questions were
to be answered at fifteen well-scatter-
ed places, to exercise out powers of
crossword-clue reading. Only one un-
fortunate resident was moved by the
sound of anxious conference outside
to protest at "that ...... noise -
it's NEARLY ONE O'CLOCK!" At this
place, too, one or two people were
seen knee—deep in the river after
taking a map-reference too literally.
Back at the gravel pits once more,
an half-hour's rest prepared the crews
for the third section, which was the
classic problem of tracing the wander-
ings of a mythical foreign agent. The
three hours allowed for this section
were far more than adequate for most
of the crews, and we ambled at leisure
to the roadhouse near Bishop's Start-
ford which was the finish. Inquiry
among the marshals failed to reveal
which of them was the mysterious agent.
Possibly, unlike ourselves, he had
lost his way after a l l .
It must be borne i n mind that
the refectories on the island site
are scheduled to be brought into use
in 1960, which means holding out far
only a few years more. However, the
authorities must be made to realise
the urgency. Meanwhile the moving of
the servioe table out of the draught
might reduce the incidence of so much
cold food.

On Wednesday, 19th. Feb., eleven m
e
m
-
bers of the Railway Society visited the
Port of London Authority Railways at
Tilbury. The railways at Tilbury are
now operated entirely by six diesel
locomotives of the Yorkshire Hngin«, Com-
pany's "Janus* type, and we were Just
in time to see the departure of four of
them after the lunch break. W
e then
inspected one of the diesels which was
in the inspection bay.
These locomotives have two 200 tup.
Rolla-Royoe o i l engines aa the poser
units with B.T.H. electrical transmis-
sions. They have a central cab with
the power units under bonnets at eaoh
end of the locomotive, giving them a
two-faced appearance. W
e were offered
a short ride and with the party in the
oab and on the running boards, this
engine was driven some distance along
the dock lines and back to the inspec-
tion bay.
Thoughts now turned to steam, for
there were s t i l l three such loooaotivea
in the running shed. One of these, a
Hudswell-Clarke of 1917 vintage waa
newly overhauled and resplendent In her
smart dark blue livery. It seeaad a
pity not to be able to photograph her
so the guide waa approached with a view
to having her pulled outside. SO sooner
had the word been said than the diesel
was started up again to pull oar quarry
out into the open, and a large naaliiii
of photographs were taken. A l l tares
looonotives are to be transferred te the
Royal Docks i n the near future.
