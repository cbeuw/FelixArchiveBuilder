La Fete de Mardi Gras took place
on Tuesday 18th Feb. I.C.W.A., en-
raged at the neglect of this festive
occasion, challenged the I.C. men to
a duel. The time - 1 p.m. (dawn was
out as most Icwarians do not rise un-
t i l midday)* The place - the quad-
rangle; the weapons - panaakes fired
from frying-pans.
I.C.W.A. stole a march on the men
by putting i n extensive practice the
previous night. Our beloved warden
appeared in his evening regalia, ob-
served the fleet-footed maidens and
was rsther surprised to find nobody
chasing them. After several laps of
the quad, he himself gave chase and
removed a Stone from the lawn. She
and the others retired far coffee.
At the appointed time seconds,
thirds, fourths, fifths, and sixths
chosen and the duel was on.
Equipped with heavy artillery,
otherwise known as pancakes, Miss
Haywood pursued Chad' around the
quad, but the President proved him-
self too fast for yet another woman.
Their honour slighted, more Iowarians
gave chase, but, despite a cunning
pass by Miss I.C.W.S.C. 1958 in the
direction of the Bar (they have a
pot there) and an unsuccessful am-
bush the men were triumphant. Later
Fred appeared on the scene and removed
the debris.

ISRAELI
An "Israeli Evening" was held in
the Concert Hall on "
. eb. 18th. This
function, which i s the third of i t s
kind, wa3 presented by I.C. Jewish Sec.
in collaboration with I.C. International
Relations Club, and, as in previous
years, was e tremendous social success.
The programme opened with a film
"Israel Journey" and continued with th
an address by Mr. George Mikes; who
gave an amusing account of Israel and
the Israelis, and compared the condi-
tion and mood of the ten-year-old state
with the climate which had prevailed at
its inception.
In the second half of the programme
the audience was entertained by an
Israeli singer, and towards the end of
the evening many of those present parti-
cipated in some rapid (and exhausting)
Israeli dancing.
Wine, nuts, fruit, halva, and good-
will were in abundance and the large
gathering went heme well contented.
AND SPANISH
More than 150 people came to the
Spanish Evening two days later, and
they a l l seemed to enjoy themselves.
There was plenty of wine on sale through-
out the evening, and the food prepared
seemed well appreciated - i t quickly
vanished.
In spite of the Spanish dialogue
the films ware interesting; especially
the Student* Sag Day infcaz-oalona( i t
showed a poXiaeman actually laughing
with the Students:)
The Tmauci» ware the star—spot of
the evening. They ware oolourfully
dressed and so energetic in their
dancing i t i s difficult to believe that
they war* not a l l Spaniard*.
Rafael Sodrigues, who followed is
one of the leading Flamenco singers
in this country, and is now making a
film at Pinewood.
The speaker, Y-r. V.'atkins, came at
very short notice. Although he said
that he was no authority on Bull-fight-
ing, his talk was extremely interesting
and informative.
The evening ended with a comedian,
Jose Antonio De Volverde, who threw
himself about the stege imitating
policemen from different countries.

On Sunday February 16th, the i n -
mates of the New Hostel were violently
awoken by Jesebel making her customary
rousing start. This time she was
bound for Heston Aerodrome where the
nine firemen thoroughly enjoyed them-
selves at the Vintage Sports Car Club
driving tests. The run in both direc-
tions was trouble free, as is expected
of Jezebel.
The sun was shining brightly on
the assembled vintage oars when
Jezebel entered the gates of the aero-
drome, and was marshalled into a pro-
minent parking place where she quickly
acquired an admiring crowd. The well
kept engine drew much attention but
unfortunately far the crowds the spare
piston was left at College. Several
remarks, interesting, amusing and
other, were heard including a sad: "She
wasn't at R.C.S. in my days."
The weather was glorious through-
out the day and i t is hoped that simi-
lar conditions will prevail for the
trip to Silverstone on April 12th.
