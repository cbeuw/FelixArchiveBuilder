EDUCATION
Dear Sir,
In recent issues of FELIX much
has been written on the supposed lack
of education of I.C. students. M:. Bridg-
water accuses I.C. of being "rather a
biased college from the point of view
of education." Surely this Is true of
any oollege.
If one consider an all-arts college
i t is obvious that there is much more
specialisation among the students than
in an all-science establishment. Few
arts colleges have a course of General
Studies lectures in science as I.C.
does in non-scientific subjects. The
typical arts student deals with non-
scientific matter both in study and
leisure. The science student is not
restricted to science but takes a
healthy interest in the arts.
Mr. Bridgwater asserts that "Edu-
cation has been said to consist mainly
of contact between students." This
may be true to a certain extent, but
students at a residential college do
not lead a normal life; they have l i t -
tle contact with the everyday life of
average people - those with whom they
will work when they have left college.
In this respect a person living in
digs has a great advantage over his
residential colleagues as he has more
opportunity of seeing how the other
half lives.
From the conclusions of Psi (ex
Leeds) one gets the impression that
his visits to I.C. have been too few
for him to have appreciated fully the
nature of life at this college. His
suggestions to rectify the matter of
"specialist university educations"
show lack of understanding of the sit-
uation.
Few people will agree that advanced
technical colleges should be abolished
- they are essential i f the country is
to keep pace with other nations in the
field of scientific development. Re-
garding his point that students are
obliged to beoome 9 to 5 types by in-
terfering grant authorities, I have
yet to come across an instance. Fin-
ally, the I,C. staff does consist of
lecturers and not teachers.
It appears to me that the popular
theory of scientists being strange
l i t t l e men tucked away in laboratories
and having no interests other than
their science is a complete fallacy.
Whether soientlsts themselves or the
general public have been responsible
for formulating this delusion would be
hard to say.
Yours faithfully.
J. w. Murray.
ERRATUM
Dear Sir,
I should like to correct a state-
ment made in your Account of the con-
cert given by the Imperial College
Orchestra on Jan. 30th, Mr. Frank
Kennard, who conducted the orchestra
on that occasion and who will conduct
the forthcoming production of "The
Mikado," i s in fact Music Master at
Alleyn's School and not at Dulwioh
College as was stated i n your report.
Yours faithfully,
J. Rodney Miles.
ELECT A RECTOR
Dear Sir,
I read in today's paper that
Jame3 Robertson Justice has been in-
stalled with much acclamation, over-
ripe tomatoes and toilet paper as
Rector of Edinburgh University. Not
so long ago, Jimmy Edwards was car-
ried shoulder high to a similar office
at Aberdeen university.
Is the time not opportune to elect
a Rector of Imperial College and to
elect such a person by a democratic
vote of the student body? As a sug-
gestion, might I propose a man who resi-
des close by oollege and who would
bring Imperial College to the notice
of a l l : Spike Milligan.
Yours hopefully,
John Druforth.
THE MASCOT QUESTION
Dear Sir,
The students of Southampton
University showed considerable enter-
prise in publicising their Centenary
Charity Rag, and i t Is unfortunate
that their efforts at I.C. necessit-
ated police intervention. The anxiety
and confusion that fcllov/ed Bo's re-
moval suggests that we could usefully
review the position of our college
mascots.
In answer to the critics who find
the whole array of carrots and priesly
bears rather childish, i t should be
pointed out that college mascots serve
as symbols of unit;.' no less ridiculous
than the hammer and sickle or the
thistle of Scotland.
Whilst i t m
a
;
" be appreciated within
London that our vintage vehicles are
inviolate, we cannot expect the pro-
vincial universities to be aware of
this agreement. Cur vehicle? have been
inspected by Royalty, they appear every
year on Morphy Day, and Bo was recently
used in a certain debagging ceremony.
Southampton might reasonably enquire
for our definition cf -ascots.
The ultimate responsibility for
Bo's abduction rests wit!: :.C.Union fcr
failing to provide an ar-realing and re-
movable alternative. :aseots like Phi-
neas and Reggie are legendary, but ever.
Imperial is forgetting its own dear
little Herbert.
It has been stated that we cannot
install Herbert in the new Vnion until
xhe contractors have completed their
period of responsibility, but i t is
hard to believe that no other jositior.
can be found. .Youlc i t not be possible
to hang Herbert in the Union archway,
for example?
There remains another alternative.
Now that Herbert has almost vanished
into obscurity we coulc without dis-
respect pension him off. He could be
succeeded by a larger and more enter-
prising three—dimensional mascot at
a vigorous Installation ceremony.
We might in this way prevent a recur-
rence of Bo's unfortunate adventure.
I remain. Sir,
your Obedient Servant,
FJi.JJtmerson.
SARAH JENKINS in the N

S
CHRONICLE last Saturday re-
ferred to the Southampton
students who "..snatched a
valuable vintage car from e
museum." Waterhouse would
doubtless have preferred
this to other comparisons
that have been made.
STUDENTS of current events will
have noted that the locations
of the 'Thor' guided weapon
sites are not being disclosed.
The reason oust be to avoid
prejudicing U. G.C, decisions
and Colcutt's whatnot _is to be
used as an I.C. Ballistic Bs-
sile.
WE WERE HAPPY to mWe the Rec-
tor leave his guests to the
care of others jtfwer a recent
Hall Dinner and wander round
the Senior Common Roo- talk-
ing to both students and staff.
If only this were normal be-
haviour on the part of our
professors as well.
WILL COSSC pleas" remove his
literature on the student fron
the Junior Oormon Room before
other students go off at tan-
gents.

FOLLY
*ar Sir,
Pay I say how surprised I was to
hear that i t was proposed to take EC
for the Southampton Rag. The folly of
this ilea was indicated by the fact
that an outside Vice-Chancellor had to
step ir. and forbid i t .
How couli we, alter stating to
everyone (literally so with the press
and news coverage,* that Bo was a
valuable antique possession and not &
rag rnascot, take i t down ourselves for
this very same rag.
knd secondly, how prcud would the
i.C. co:.ti;.ger.t be, riding ir. the Rag
prooessi.r. on a vehicle that nad been
returned to them sin ly because of the
threat of action by the academic
author-ties and even the Police.
Nc, ar. official I.C. party shc-uld
have gone down by train or comer.,
leaving Bo at name surrounded by a
reinforced shield, to seek revenge
by the only face-saving method i.e.
the capture of the Southampton Union
President and their mascot.
Yours etc.,
A-A. Kilmer
