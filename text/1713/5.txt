Lefty YouTubers event draws large crowds

SuperMechaGodzilla,
who, in 2013, posted a
Communist analysis of
the film Prometheus, and
basically radicalised me
on the spot”. This was the
answer of Harry Brewis
(Hbomberguy) to the
question on how he was
introduced to leftism.
With such a starting shot,
the Politics in the Age of
YouTube event on the
past Tuesday 29th of
January chaired by ICL
Labour Club’s President
Ansh Bhatnagar was an-
ticipated to be quite a wild
ride. Him and three other
fellow YouTubers debated
for two hours on current
politics, philosophy, and
the mechanics of video
making.
“Conservatives seemed
quite hip when I was
young. I used to be an
question. Indeed, each of
their paths towards leftism
were quite different. In the
case of Oliver Thorn (Phi-
losophyTube), it was radi-
calisation by “an unironic
Marxist academic.”
The conversation then
moved to the reasons why
they had decided to start
making videos. “Instead
of posting hot takes on
Twitter, I decided to make
something and contribute
to the conversation”,
stated Angie (Angie-
Speaks, prefers to go by
her first name). “There’s
a section of the LefTube
community oversaturated
with content that focuses
on making fun of reac-
tionaries. I wanted to go
a bit beyond that.” Brewis
also weighted in: “People
have to change their own
minds and the best thing
you can do is giving them
encouragement to do so.”
“Not everyone can
make YouTube videos.
Thecreatorsaredispropor-
tionally white cis males,
and minority voices are
very uncommon. There’s
also the fact that its is very
American. I would love to
hear perspectives from
other countries, though
in many cases there is
a language barrier [that
makes the conversation
harder].”, said Thorn.
Brewis was very hopeful
in the power of this new
media channel as a tool
for the empowerment of
leftism: “If Left YouTube
had been present 4 years
ago, we may had had
President Contrapoints [a
famous YouTube creator
that has done many videos
on politics and gender] by
now.”Angie was also keen
to share her experiences
in the platform: “One of
the great things is that,
nowadays, there’s a very
big community of creators
and subscribers that can
provide feedback to your
content. They can tell you
when you have made a bad
take, especially in videos
with controversial topics.
I had a recent experience
with this, and people were
very constructive, except
for a couple of people that
came after me surprising-
ly viciously.”
One of the main topics
discussed was the state
of trans rights in the
UK. Brewis famously
did a day-long Donkey
Kong stream to raise
funds for Mermaids, a
trans-supporting charity
that has been relentlessly
attacked by transphobes
in social media. Why is
there such a backlash
in this country against
trans rights? “England
is uniquely TERFy.
Maybe because there’s a
tendency for middle class,
white, centrist feminism
in our media.”, was the
perspective of Thorn.
Brewis’ reasoning was
similar: “It’s the tabloids.
Every opinionator there
thinks themselves as
vaguely progressive, and
when they find an issue
they do not understand
they have to have a take
on it. Mumsnet is a very
British place. In England
you have former comedy
writers screaming all day
about the matter.”
And where is the
movement heading
to? What plans do our
creators have for the
future? “I am going to
keep making weird shit.
My content has started
being noticed by main-
stream media, so there’s
a bit of space for growing
from here.”, said Thorn,
who has been profiled by
The Atlantic and The New
York Times. “I hope the
LeftyTube communities
matures and gets rid of
some of its more shitty
habits. I would also like to
see a bigger challenge to
the liberal hegemony left
of the centre.”, remarked
Angie. Jacobs was also
positive about the future,
though much work still
needs to be done: “We
need to capture the narra-
tive, ensure that ours and
other yet unheard voices
are effectively heard.
We are the future. It is a
gradual process.”
The event finished
with a Q&A round with
the audience. Hot topics
like gun control were
discussed. Three of the
guests happened to be
quite in agreement in their
position on the matter:
“Gun control has the
effect of disproportionally
affecting minorities first. I
am in principle pro-gun,
though I understand the
controversy with that.
Gun control was first in-
stituted against the Black
Panthers.”, answered
Jacobs. Angie built up
on that argument: “If I
lived in America, I would
own a gun. Institutionally
violence is dispropor-
tionally directed against
People of Colour.”.
Brewis nodded in agree-
ment: “It would be very
nice if there were no guns
at all, but in reality there
are. I am with Angie, I
hate guns, but if I lived in
America I would definite-
ly buy one. Nonetheless, it
is a complicated issue.”
It was quite a popular
talk, judging from the
fully packed room, one of
the lecture theatres in the
Sir Alexander Fleming
Building. Imperial
students seem to be
growing more interested
in politics, but will the
trend hold? We in the
Felix Politics section very
much hope so!
