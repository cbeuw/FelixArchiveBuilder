n Saturday
2nd February,
at 5:45am,
50 brave
ICXC runners boarded
the coach, ready to set
off and compete in the
BUCS Cross-Country
Championships hosted by
the University of Exeter.
At 6:06am, a not-so-
brave ICXC over-sleeper
arrived and the club was
finally able to depart.
After another 3 solid
hours of sleep on the bus
to finish off the short
night, the athletes began
to wake up and admire
the snowy rolling hills of
Devon.
Luckily, the sun was
shining and despite the
chilly weather forecast
everyone was buzzing to
reach their destination
and conquer the course
in what promised to be a
thrilling day of racing.
For the girls, braids,
hair ribbons, and glitter
displaying Imperial’s
blue and red were hastily
put into position as they
approached the race
location.
Upon arriving at Bicton
Collegethesquadhadtime
to scout out the route, with
particular areas of interest
including the daunting
(but optional) lake water
feature followed by a
steep hill climb and the
dreadful incline to the
finish.
With their numbers
and game face on, the
women kicked off the day
of competition with their
6.7km race set to start at
12 sharp.
Just like the racers,
the spectators were
also warmed up and
ready, along with their
megaphones, cow bells,
vuvuzelas and air horns.
With 619 women lined
up and ready to go in the
biggest race of the day,
they could expect plenty
of congestion and lots of
pushing and shoving to
make their way out of the
pack.
Impressive perfor-
mances included GB
athlete Dani Chattenton’s
7th place, followed by
Alex Mundell in 61st
position and Kate Olding
in 81st, together with
admirable achievements
from the rest of the
women’s team.
The second of the three
races was the Men’s A
race in which the 6 fastest
men from each university
competed.
Unfortantely, the air-
horns were left airless
after the Women’s race
thanks to the phenomenal
support and cheering for
the rest of the team. This
meant that the valiant
supporters now had to rely
solely on cow bells, vu-
vuzelas, a megaphone, and
their voices to motivate
the runners around this
gruelling course.
After an extremely
speedy race, the 1st
Imperial athlete home
was Luke Caldwell in
an exceptional 11th
place, followed by a
top 50 for Dan Mulryan
who finished 49th, Niki
Faulkner in 57th, Oliver
Newton in 126th and
first-time A-racer Charlie
McFadzean in 148th.
Lastly, a total of 522
runners set off for the
Men’s B (for “Banter”)
race where the rest of the
boys proudly represented
Imperial.
After the lake feature
saw Women’s Captain
Charlotte take a graceful
tumble in the Women’s
race, it was fresher Matt
Ryan’s turn with a leg-
endary dive worthy of an
Olympic gold (see photo
montage above).
Overall, there were
again fantastic results
that saw Joe Pomfret in
126th position, finishing
with exactly the same
time as Thomas Bayley
in 127th, former Club
Captain Matt Douthwaite
in 130th and current Club
Captain Fergus Johnson
in 137th. Likewise, all the
boys were triumphant and
congratulated for their
remarkable efforts.
As is tradition, post-
race baking was in order,
and after BUCS XC it
was more like a feast.
Pistachio cake, croissants,
millionaire shortbread,
brownies, cookies;
everbody had prepared
their best recipes.
Before leaving our
camp and taking down the
flag, it was time for the
classic team photo with an
additional feature: BUCS
bandanas made from
some of the finest race
tape they had managed to
find on the course.
After a refreshing
shower and well-deserved
rest, the dress code had
changed. Blue and red
racing vests off, matching
tie-dye T-shirts on.
The team then headed
for dinner at an unlimited
Chinese buffet (fries,
curry, cakes, haribos -
was it really Chinese?),
passing by Exeter’s
Cathedral and admiring
the longest uninterrupted
vaulted ceiling in England
on the way.
Dinner was filled
with lots of ear, calf, and
bicep touching along with
more merry antics such
as eating a spoon full of
a spice or herb that best
represented oneself.
Before heading towards
the final destination of the
night, the team took a
mandatory stop at a pub
called “The Imperial”.
It was now time to
head for the famous
BUCS XC after-party at
Lemon Grove (University
of Exeter’s version of
Metric) for some boogie!
Lots of boogie actually,
because with the ridicu-
lous levels of air condi-
tioning it was probably
colder on the dance floor
than outside…
Thefollowingmorning,
many of the team asked
themselves whether their
sore legs were from the
race or from the outra-
geous shapes cut on the
dancefloor. They may
never know.
Before departure for
London, some were brave
enough to venture into the
blinding sunshine quickly
enough to see Exeter’s
cathedral in all its glory.
The club would
like to congratulate all
the runners for their
stellar performances on
Saturday and wish them
well as they go again in
this Saturday’s famous
Hyde Park Relays and
after-party.
