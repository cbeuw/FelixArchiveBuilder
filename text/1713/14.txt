H
i there,
I am a bin
Your humble biographer
Wherever I may be
Beside the kitchen sink yawning
in the morning
to catch your cereal packet
or an unwashed peanut butter jar
Standing on the landing at University
you pass me everyday
occasionally greet
me with a screwed up tissue.

N
ow that
Ve g a n u a r y
2019 has come
to an end, it’s
the perfect time to reflect
on the cultural shift vegan-
ism and the plant-based
message experienced in
recent decades. Veganism,
it’s fair to say, has recently
experienced a leap from
the fringe into the spot-
light, with many reasons
underlying its ever-grow-
ing popularity.
Over 681,000 people
in the UK (approximately
1% of the population)
currently follow a vegan
diet: a number predicted
to increase by 327% in the
coming year, while google
searches for ‘vegan’
quadrupled between 2012
and 2017, exceeding both
‘vegetarian’ and ‘gluten
free’ search terms. Partic-
ipation in the Veganuary
campaign (which has
approximately doubled
with each successive year
since its establishment
in the UK in 2014), has
meanwhile peaked again
this year with an estimated
300,000 new participants.
Such a dramatic swing
has prompted many to
wonder: what concerns
are driving our blossom-
ing appetite for conscious
consumerism when it
comes to abstaining from
products borne of animal
exploitation? Early teach-
ings, such as those found
in Jainism, Buddhism
and Hinduism, alongside
the views of prominent
figures including Pythag-
oras and Plutarch, have
traditionally considered
moral and ethical issues
surrounding the relation-
ship between humans
and animals. Are modern
minds changing en masse
according to these ideas,
or is there more to it?
Indeed, much of the
modern focus remains
(appropriately) on the
injustices committed
against animals for the
production of meat,
dairy, eggs and other
animal-derived products,
with a growing number of
documentaries portraying
the treatment of animals
used for food production.
However, the interest
fuelling this modern surge
towards plant-based living
extends beyond concerns
relating to ethics and
morals, rather, tapping
into mounting worries
surrounding the impact of
An ever-growing body
of science continues
to support the positive
implications of adopting
a plant-based lifestyle
with regard to our health
and the planet. From the
perspective of health,
a vegan diet has been
shown to offer protec-
tion against numerous
conditions including
obesity, type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular mor-
tality. Meanwhile, only
those living under rocks
could manage to miss
the mounting evidence
revealing the disturbing
and staggering contribu-
tions of animal agriculture
towards deforestation,
species extinction, and
global warming. Given
the increasing availability
of this information to an
ever more informed pop-
ulation, the rapidity with
which the vegan message
continues to chime with a
growing portion of society
is hardly surprising.
Looking at results from
a survey of participants
in the 2018 campaign, as
reported by Plant Based
News, 43% of respond-
ents listed animal welfare
and rights issues as

“Veganism,

with new adherents to the
lifestyle, the numerous
benefits besides the initial
motivation that sparked
one person’s interest
tend to become apparent
quickly, and lead them to
inspire others to consider
the source and impact of
their purchases.
Altogether, the over-
whelming success of
Veganuary and contin-
uing rise of interest in
veganism as a whole has
set a fantastic precedent
for 2019, which looks
to be the strongest year
yet for the plant-based
diet. And with high street
stores now racing to outdo
each other with fresh ve-
gan-friendly products and
ranges such as the now-in-
famous Greggs meat-free

A unique expression on the waste issue from a unique

Rubbish bin overfilled // ...
At lunchtime I watch open-mouthed
as you forage fridges of film-wrapped sandwhiches.
Waste. Produce of haste.
You haven’t seen what my grown-up brothers do who
graduated into industry
or work at the supermarkets on the night-shift.
Finished lunch. Yum - a wooden fork and knife.
At last something but plastic.
Though they’re not going to biodegrade
In a rubbish dump sealed anaerobically.
I have a cousin. He’s a bit of a hippie.
Got his head dyed green.
Thinks he can take most things
Calls himself a recycling bin
He sends two-thirds of his earnings overseas
for developing nations to deal with.
Evening. Black Friday.
You come in with a discounted ready meal
I feel a fuzzy feeling, like a stocking on Christmas day.
I am tired
But there is no time for rest
Many miles away
Oceans churn
Incinerators burn
My belly ends and landfill begins.
