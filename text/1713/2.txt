A wholesome Editorial
I
f you've had the
pleasure of reading
one of my Edito-
rials before, you'll
know that I hate writing
them. With a passion. It
has fast become the bane
of my existence, hence
why I procrastinate and
leave them to the last
minute. Which is where
we are now, after a day
of successful procras-
tination, it is just past
10pm and I'm writing
this wretched thing. Ask
me to review a Kendrick
Lamar album and I'll
give you page upon page
of in-depth analysis into
the inner workings of
King Kendrick's mind.
Ask me to write an
Editorial and I struggle
to string together half a
page. Anyway, we move.
On to serious business.
Front page news this
week is the revalation that
all students who signed
up to Sport Imperial prior
to the 1st
September price
change are now eligible
to a full refund of the £30
fee. As someone that was
particularly disgruntled at
the price change, this is
a significant move on the
part of Sport Imperial and
the Union to rectify their
error. Although I am still
slightly annoyed that I am
not actually eligible for a
refund myself, I think it's
important to acknowledge
that Sport Imperial has
realised its mistake and
moved quickly to rectify
the issue and come up
with a smooth remedy.
This is also significant
because it represents a
major change that was
brought about as a direct
result of the student voice.
I'm particularly gassed
because Henry Hart
initially accused Sport
Imperial of fraud through
writing a Felix article and
that article was effectively
the first 'domino to fall'. If
anything, this is proof of
the impact students can
have to better their situ-
ation at Imperial if they
2
decide to use their voice,
be it through writing Felix
article or by any other
means. Finally, I wouldn't
let the disappointment sur-
rounding the gym blunder
overshadow the fact that
Sport Imperial are making
major moves to improve
sport at Imperial, an issue
that has been present since
I joined as an undergradu-
ate in October 2014.
Tomorrow is the Felix
Annual Dinner, the most
wholesome of wholesome
events. I was going to
use this editorial to write
the speech I'll say at the
dinner but, as per usual,
I'll end up imporivising
that on the fly tomorrow.
Instead, I'll preview my
speech with some of the
initial ideas I've had so far.
Much like my approach
to most things in life, I
liken running Felix to
managing my team, Man-
chester United. Fred was a
legend, much like SirAlex
Ferguson, and left behind
a title-winning squad (the
Felix fam). In my tenure,
I think I've embodied all
of the managers that have
come in since Fergie's
retirement. I began my
tenure just as hapless as
David Moyes, moved on
to being as ineffective
as Louis Van Gaal and
I've flattered to deceive,
like Jose Mourinho.
Now I think I'm having a
resurgence, much like Ole
Gunnar Solskjaer, and the
Felix fam is performing
like title winners. I also
want to take this chance
to congratulate Music
Editor, Simran Kukran,
on securing her PhD
placement. A big win for
the team! Without Simran
convincing me to write
for Felix in my third year,
and then convincing me to
run for editor last year, I
wouldn't even be involved
in Felix.
Finally, section of the
week goes to Books!
Indira has written an ex-
ceptional review, so well
written that she should
probably have my job.
prior to the price change.
The sum of the refund-
able gym fees amounts
to over £100,000 and the
decision to offer students
a refund was taken in
December 2018. The
refunds are expected to
be processed within five
ambition to improve sport
for all at the College” and
comes amidst a slew of
positive changes to sport
at Imperial. “At £30, we
still wanted to make sure
that it was affordable, ac-
cessible and appropriate,”
commented Mr. Hollyer.
With all funds gen-
erated being directly
reinvested in facility and
service developments,
improvements, such as the
full replacement of gym
equipment and refurbish-
ment of Ethos, Charing
Cross and Hammersmith
gyms, have occurred and
plans are underway for the
expansion of Ethos gym
(thanks to the President’s
fund). Sport Imperial have
also announced plans to
introduce an app which
will include activity track-
ing and a reward scheme
designed to encourage
physical activity, whilst
also improving function-
ality for Ethos bookings.
Mr. Hollyer added:
“What we don’t want is it
to be the defining issue of
working days.
James Medler, the
Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) told Felix:
“This is a really big step
in the fact that the student
voice has been really lis-
tened to and that’s going
to result in probably a few
thousand students getting
their money back.”
This error in changing
the membership was
made “with the earnest
the strategy when we’ve
got loads of really excit-
ing stuff. We’re just about
to change effectively the
Will Mondays forever be meatless?
J
anuary has come
and gone, along
with the trial of
Meat Free Mon-
day. So what’s next?
Will Meat Free Monday
become a permanent
scheme on campus?
Meat Free Monday
(MFM) was a student
campaign created from
a combination of ideas
that came from different
undergraduate socie-
ties, PhD students, and
Masters student groups,
with the help of many
volunteers, Greening Im-
perial, College Catering
and the Union. With huge
support from College and
the Union, over 35 outlets
across four campuses took
part, including all College
and Union outlets, as
well as Pieminister and
Silwood catering!
Throughout the month,
a wide range of events and
stalls were put on, high-
lighting all the different
reasons you should eat
meat one less day a week.
While the main aim of
the campaign was to
reduce our environmental
impact; there are also
health benefits to reducing
your meat consumption,
explained on our stall
by Dr Cullimore, and
financial benefits if you
continued MFM at home,
as meat is more expensive
than grains and veg.
Others interpreted it as a
fun challenge, and some
took it one step further by
giving #veganuary a go.
Meanwhile, the Animal
Protection & Education
Society (APES) high-
lighted the animal welfare
benefits by using virtual
reality demonstrations,
provided by the Animal
Equality charity.
Overall, the campaign
was a success at getting
students to talk about the
idea of MFM. There was
buzz online, chatter in
cafes, and articles written
by you in Felix! Knowing
there would be a split in
student opinions, MFM
was always advertised
as a trial, with the final
decision to continue or
not to continue being
left up to you! You voted
in the Instagram polls,
you filled out the online
survey, and you told us
your comments.
So what was the de-
cision? Will Meat Free
Monday become a perma-
nent campaign?
With 523 people taking
part in the survey (69.9%
of which stated they
were meat eaters), 57.7%
of you wished for it to
continue, while 40.0%
did not and the remainder
were impartial. However,
the Instagram polls of 200
voters swung the other
way, with 53.9% wishing
for it not to continue. With
no clear winner, it was
hard to decide whether
to turn the Meat Free
Monday trial into a per-
manent campaign or not.
What did stand out in the
survey, was the demand
for more information
about the environmental
sustainability of the food
options, as 84.7% of
students considered the
impact of their diet on
the environment. Further-
more, talking to students
highlighted concerns
about the lack of options
regularly on campus for
vegetarian and vegan
dishes, as well as a lack of
healthy dishes that had a
wide variety.
With all this informa-
tion, the College Cater-
ing service and I have
decided not to continue
Meat Free Monday, but
instead to shift the focus
for the remainder of the
year to providing a wider
range of healthier options
(meat and plant based) on
campus! Some changes
are already being made,
such as the introduction
of the new salad bar in the
Senior Common Room
(SCR).
So what do College
Catering and I have in
plan for you for the rest of
the year? Well, get ready
for some big changes!
Think new, plant-based,
sustainable café - a place
where you can relax while
enjoying fresh, healthy,
and, most importantly,
delicious meals. Opening
in Summer term, inspi-
ration for food options,
new service structures,
and café layouts is cur-
rently being gathered in
preparation for this café,
with new dishes being
trialled in the other outlets
to gain student feedback.
If you have a dish you
love/hate, then let College
know by filling out the
experience box on the
feedback form: imperial.
ac.uk/food-and-drink/
contact-us. Other ideas
being debated include
moving the College Cafe
hot sandwiches to the
JCR, while also adding a
salad bar and a rotisserie
chicken stand, intro-
ducing 24-hour vending
machines which contain
meals and snacks to help
you power through those
late night study sessions,
or introducing a pizza and
pasta cafe on campus! I’ll
be keeping you up-to-date
regularly, with blog posts
and updates on my Union
webpage about the excit-
ing progressions!
