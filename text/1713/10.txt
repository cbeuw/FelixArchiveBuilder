Good Dog: Tales of Dignity in the Cauldron of Poverty
Poverty has a drowning
effect. Those who are
economically oppressed
will often find themselves
berated for paddling in an
overly ferocious manner
as they struggle for
breath. Whilst the media
and large swathes of pol-
iticians have failed to give
voice to these suffocating
communities, many
artists are standing up to
give insightful, honest
and humane responses.
Arinzé Kene’s Good Dog
is a striking example of
this. Here at the Watford
Palace theatre, Kwaku
Mills channels Kene’s
words to give a dignified
and compassionate insight
into the daily struggles
affecting far too many
people in modern day
Britain.
Delivered as a mono-
logue, interspersed with
noughties grime and
garage, the play begins
with Mills as an innocent
school boy who worships
“good” fervently. His
steadfast and dutiful
responses to the daily
challenges of his family’s
poverty are naive to the
point where one is im-
mediately aware trouble
will come. Along with
his own struggles, Mills’s
all seeing eye peers from
his balcony to bring us
stories of a variety of
characters from his estate.
The local corner shop
duo of “Gandhi” and his
stray cat are particularly
great. Each is judged in
turn, being cast initially
by the naive child as good
or bad. Although many
of the good characters
are currently struggling,
we are reassured that
it is merely a matter of
time before their fortunes
change. Unsurprisingly
this doesn’t prove to be
the case.
Life begins to wear not
Rather than leaving him
in a continued state of
haplessness, his decisions
are a clawing attempt for
dignity made by a child
under immense pressure.
The ability of Mills, who
is excellent throughout,
to translate this reasoning
for a range of different
characters as he narrates
their lives is astounding.
Stage centre for the play’s
entirety is a charred
monolithic cube. Swirls
of smoke slowly billow
from its carcass-like
frame, evoking memories
of Grenfell.
A statue to the kind of
inevitable and depressing
end game that often
meets Mill’s ensemble of
downtrodden neighbours.
This air of inevitability
that the play is soaked
in adds an uneasiness to
your viewing. Here it is
the London Riots that
will be the play’s climax.
The intelligence of Kene
is to present this political
tragedy as a human one.
We see anger as dignity
and structural oppression
as daily struggle. There is
no sense of politics being
played, just life as it is
experienced. This, along
with the interesting range
of characters makes for
essential viewing.
Witness for the Prosecution
W
ho doesn’t
remember
readingAgatha
Christie’s
books as a child? Murder
mysteries, full of suspense
and intrigue, invariably
with an unexpected twist
or surprising revelation
in the dénouement. The en-
during popularity of Agatha
Christie has seen a plethora
of film, stage and West End
adaptations of her stories,
such as Kenneth Branagh’s
relatively recent Murder on
the Orient Express.
Witness for the Prose-
cution was adapted for the
stage by Christie herself
from her short story,
Traitor Hands. As the title
suggests, the courtroom
drama, a small part of the
original story, becomes
the focus of the play. And
where better to set an
exciting courtroom drama
than an actual courthouse?
Lucy Bailey’s produc-
tion is set in the spectac-
ular Council Chamber of
the old London County
Hall – and boy, do she
and designer William
Dudley make use of the
grandiose surroundings!
From the moment you
step in, the austere marble
architecture and sweeping
staircases immediately
conjure the solemn at-
mosphere of a courthouse.
The impression only
intensifies on entering
the Chamber itself – a
soaring domed ceiling,
Lady Justice on the wall,
and concentric rows of red
leather seats, each with its
own tiny wooden desk,
looking down upon the
small stage area.
You feel like you’re
actually in court, watching
things happen in real time.
Discreet, brass-covered
speakers are dotted
between the seats at
ear-level, imperceptibly
generating the ambient
murmurs of the court-
room. This is quite clever
on the part of Dudley and
sound designer Mic Pool.
Not only does it overcome
the acoustic challenges of
the vaulted ceiling, but
when particular events
happen on stage, the
shocked gasps that fill the
room seem to come from
the audience itself. The
illusion of being ‘in court’
is very real – the witness-
es are even called from
outside the chamber, and
make their way through
the audience to the stand.
The trial we’re attend-
ing is that of the young
Leonard Vole (Daniel
Solbe), accused of mur-
dering a rich old lady
of his acquaintance for
her money. Sir Wilfrid
Roberts (Jasper Britton),
convinced of his inno-
cence, must fight his old
rival Myers (William
Chubb) in court to save
him from the noose. But
with all the evidence
against Vole, it looks to
be a losing battle. And
there’s Vole’s enigmatic
foreign wife, Romaine
(Emma Rigby)…
It’s a suitably melodra-
matic, if somewhat cliché,
plot. At least up until the
last fifteen minutes of the
play, when everything is
upended in not one, but
two dramatic twists! It is
an Agatha Christie plot
after all. Without giving
too much away, it definite-
ly comes as a surprise and
leads the play to its thrill-
ing conclusion. If I have
one complaint, it’s that
the twists are almost too
out-of-the-blue. Unlike
the best mystery novels
where you can guess who
the killer is, we’re almost
completely in the dark
until the big reveal.
Solbe is utterly con-
vincing as Leonard Vole
– you’d never believe the
honest-faced young lad
capable of murder. Or
would you? Opposite him,
Rigby makes a captivating
Romaine – seductive, sly
and ever so foreign with
her thick German accent.
And Britton looks like
he was plucked from the
Queen’s Bench Division
to play Sir Wilfrid
Robarts, with Chubb’s
dogmatic and slightly
prissy Myers serving
as his foil. Though she
doesn’t spend much time
on stage, Phoebe Marshall
also deserves a special
mention for her delight-
fully vapid portrayal of
Sir Wilfrid’s secretary
Greta.
Witness for the Pros-
ecution is definitely a
night to remember. It’s
not exactly subtle or
soul-searching with its
trope-heavy plot and
stereotypical characters,
but then again it’s never
promised to be anything
else. With its spectacular
setting and dramatic plot,
it’s entertainment anyone
will enjoy, regardless
of whether they prefer
Nietzsche or Netflix.

“Essential
viewing”
only at the growing Mills,
whose life we see pass by
before our eyes, but also
on the supposedly good
figures who never find
themselves rewarded.
More bewildering to Mills
is the fact that the ‘bad’
characters seem to be
prospering. This is where
Kene’s subtle writing
shines. The young Mills
slowly becomes ‘bad’, the
reason for the quotes being
the play’s underlying
point: one has a sense of
respect or understanding
for the boy’s decisions.

Counting Sheep: Join the Revolution!
M
ark and
M a r i c h k a
M a r c z y k ,
c r e a t o r s
and writers of Counting
Sheep, met and fell in
love in the barricades
in Maidan Square while
fighting for life and free-
dom. The show is directed
by Natalia Kaliada and
Nicolai Khalezin, polit-
ical refugees due to their
illegal theatre company,
the Belarus Free Theatre,
in a country where all
theatre must be state-sanc-
tioned. From this unique
artistic collaboration
arises a powerful political
argument for democracy,
human rights and peace,
without ever falling into
the trap of self-pity. The
events in the play are
based on historical facts
and the personal stories of
Mark and Marichka, who
also perform (though not
as themselves), notably
the wall, as Protesters,
from where we are invited
to join the fight; or around
the table, also as Protest-
ers, but with premium
olution and witnesses of
police brutality, burning
destruction and deadly
sniper shots. We also meet
Marichka, a classical
pianist who was due to
have the most important
concerts of her life the
day the revolution broke
out. The gigs were can-
celled, and she joined the
fight. With her, and thanks
to Georgina Beaty’s
astonishingly bold perfor-
mance, we feel the urge to
care for the wounded, the
despair at being unable to
help, and the anguish of
not knowing if the ones
we love are safe.
There is an interesting
phenomenon of collec-
tive compliance to the
increasingly complex
tasks we, as an audience,
are asked to perform. We
don’t really understand
how we went from being
comfortably seated to
joining in the rhythmic
section of an electrifying
song, cheering as a couple
of strangers gets married,
playing musical chairs,
holding shields and
helmets among sandbags,
bricks and toppled tables,
helping strangers to clean
the barricades in the
aftermath of bloodshed
and taking part, horrified,
in funeral ceremonies.
The transition is subtle
and never forced, but the
fact remains that an ini-
tially reluctant audience
(including myself!) ended
up as central players in the
show. The adequate tone
is achieved during the
whole performance, now
joyful and overflowing
with tradition and national
pride, now respectful and
mournful for the hundreds
of lost lives, now resilient
and confident in the re-
building of the country.
From a technical
perspective, we couldn’t
wish for anything more.
Smartphones are encour-
aged and brilliantly used
in the show, together with
continuous projections
of real footage from the
uprising that bring realism
and a larger dimension to
the show. Lights, sound
effects and choreograph-
ical stunts are all crea-
tively employed to build
a complete theatrical
experience. The sets are
completely transformed
before our eyes, so fast
that we barely notice.
However, what truly takes
the show to the next level
is the music, brought
to us by the Marczyk
couple’s Balaklava Blues
project. Influenced by
trance and electro-pop
but with an ethnic touch,
this mix of recordings,
live performance and
electronic manipulation
add continuity and unity
to the play. There are
some beautiful moments
of singing and playing,
heartwrenching emotion,
powerful rhythms and
amazing polyphonies,
created with the expertise
of classical training and
ethnomusicology.
An award-winning
“Guerrilla Folk Opera”,
Counting Sheep is an ex-
plosive stage experience
that dwells on life and
death and leaves no one
indifferent.
Counting Sheep is a fully immersive theatrical experience that transports the audience to the events of the Kiev
Uprising in 2014.

“An unique
artistic
collaboration”
by giving life to the origi-
nal soundtrack.
Arriving at the Forge,
one of the venues in the
VAULTFestival, we find a
long table, rustic benches
and makeshift seats made
from concrete blocks,
tyres and wooden planks.
Ukranian and European
flags are an important part
of the set, as well as an
old-looking upright piano
with the internal mecha-
nism exposed. Depending
on the ticket type, we
might sit in the galleries,
away from the action, and
play the role of Observer;
in the benches closer to
“Electrifying”
privileges that include
Ukranian food and vodka.
Mark, played by
Michael Edwards, is
our guide: a Canadian
musician with Ukranian
roots, back to the ancestral
land during a work trip.
His job was to record local
music for a new film. With
him, we meet the chaos of
train stations, observe the
nightlife in Kiev and ex-
perience the gastronomic
and touristic attractions
of the city. The actors sit
among us, we share a meal
and make toasts to some
unintelligible sentences,
sing, dance and are merry
together. Later, as a city of
tents emerges in Ukraine’s
historical Independence
Square and pro-European
protests unfold around us,
we become part of the rev-
