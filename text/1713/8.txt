What next for Science in a No-Deal Brexit

n 14th
June
2016, just
over a week
before the EU
referendum, an open
letter, signed by thirteen
Vote Leave ministers,
was published to calm the
fears of British scientists,
farmers and others who
relied on European funds.
It pledged: “If the public
votes to leave on 23rd
June, we will continue to
fund EU programmes in
the UK until 2020.” One
of the thirteen signatories
was Dominic Raab.
However, Scientists
were quick to point out
the irony of one of the first
things Dominic Raab did
as the newly-appointed
Brexit Secretary. On 21st
July 2018, he suggested
that the UK might not
honour the hard-wrangled
withdrawal agreement
that guarantees continued
funding of EU pro-
grammes until 2020.
On 15th
January 2019,
Parliament roundly
rejected May’s deal with
the European Union,
which lays out the terms
for an orderly withdrawal.
This historic defeat for
U.K. Prime Minister
Theresa May makes the
prospect of crashing out
of the EU without a deal
more likely.
On Tuesday 5th
February, the Campaign
for Science and Engin-
erring, CaSE, published
its evidence to the House
of Commons Science &
Technology Committee
inquiry into the implica-
tions of a no-deal Brexit
for science and engineer-
ing.
To date, the UK has
secured over €5.1bn of
EU Horizon 2020 funding
since the inception of the
programme in 2014, the
second largest recipient of
funding.
A no-deal Brexit
would mean UK insti-
tutions would no longer
be eligible for three
Horizon 2020 funding
lines: European Research
Council (ERC) grants,
Marie Skłodowska-Curie
actions (MSCA), and
SME instrument (SMEi)
grants for small innova-
tive businesses.
This would be a huge
blow for UK science and
innovation. The campaign
group ‘Scientists for
EU’ calculated that these
streams equate to 45% of
the UK’s receipts to date
from Horizon 2020. That
is to say a no-deal Brexit
will cost UK research
€577.35m (£520.7m) a
year in lost opportunity
to access these golden
grants.
By far the most critical
of those funding lines
is the ERC. The ERC
typically awards grants
of €1-2m to bring about
new and unpredictable
scientific and technolog-
ical discoveries. for the
very best, creative re-
searchers from anywhere
in the world to undertake
pioneering research in EU
and associated countries,
and to build a team around
them.
top recipients in Europe.
These projects demon-
strate our ambitions to
collaborate and work even
closer with partners in
Europe.
That is why we are
supporting and encour-
aging colleagues to
keep applying for new
European grants, as we
campaign for continued
access to European
research programmes
after Brexit.”
The government has
pledged that in the event
of a no deal, grant funding
awarded to UK institu-
tions would be underwrit-
ten to make up for the loss
of EU funding.
However, as mentioned
in CaSE’s statement, the
Government has yet to
detail the administrative
mechanisms in place to
administer the guarantee
if it becomes necessary.
It has also yet to confirm
that the money for the
underwrite will be new
money and not taken from
existing research budgets.
Mike Galsworthy,
co-founder and director of
Scientists for EU, writes
in his article for The
Guardian that “even if the
UK government were to
compensate our research
community for the finan-
cial loss of ERC grants,
it would take far longer
than the few months left
until Brexit Day to build
a fund as prestigious and
attractive to global talent
as the ERC”.
In an open letter
published on 4th
January,
over 150 UK universities
have warned the Govern-
ment that leaving the EU
without a deal is “one of
the biggest threats” the in-
stitutions have ever faced.
They have urged the
Government to commit
to replacing these EU
sources of funding to UK
researchers in the event of
a ‘no deal’ Brexit.

With more than £0.5 billion a year of research funding at stake, a no-deal Brexit could have catastrophic
consequences for the UK’s science and engineering community
Imperial is also cam-
paigning for the UK
government to guarantee
scientific mobility through
automatic visas for
winners of major research
grants, such as Horizon
2020 or UKRI. Imperial
is also calling for an ex-
pansion and streamlining
of Tier 1 visas for highly
skilled staff.
Speaking to Naturem,
following Imperial’s
launch of a strategic
partnership in education,
research and innovation
with the Technical Uni-
versity of Munich (TUM)
in October 2018, Vice
President (International)
Professor Dallman said:
“We’re naturally inter-
ested in any mechanism
that allows us to continue
fruitful collaborations
we have established with
European partners over
the decades”.
A survey of around
1,000 staff at the Francis
Crick Institute, which
Imperial is a founding
partner of, showed that an
overwhelming majority,
97%, of those who re-
sponded said a no-deal
Brexit would be bad for
UK science.
Britain is scheduled
to leave the EU on 29th
March, but a deal on the
terms of its departure is
yet to be fully agreed.
Although the ERC
awards are just over ten
years old, recipients have
won six Nobel prizes,
four Fields medals and
five Wolf prizes. One in
14 publications from ERC
projects rank in the top
1% most cited worldwide.
Imperial is one of
Europe’s top recipients
of funding, hosting 97
ERC grants so far. As
recently as December,
three Imperial academics
won around €6 million

further their research in

and computing respec-
tively in the ERC’s latest

Grants funding, second
out of UK institutions.

Nick Jennings said:
“These grants are highly

However, a few days
later, 15 notable academ-
ics, co-wrote a letter in
The Guardian criticising
what they view as the
scaremongering of certain
higher education bodies,
including the Russell
Group, about the effects
of Brexit.
They believe, with a
clean sovereign Brexit,
British universities can
still have success with
EU funding, like other
successful third-party
countries (Israel, Norway
and Switzerland, for
example), and will doubt-
lessly continue to partic-
ipate in EU programmes
like Horizon 2020 at will.
