Ferrante Reviewed
Books writer, Indira Mallik, reflects onThe Neapolitan Quartet - My Brilliant Friend, The Story of a New Name,
Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, The Story of the Lost Child - by Elena Ferrante
T
here are some
books that you
want to devour
as fast as pos-
sible, sleep becomes
secondary to being car-
ried along the twists and
turns of a novel’s relent-
less plots. Other books
are to be savoured, each
sentence in its perfect
composition wondered
over. Very rarely, a book
is both. The Neapolitan
quartet, I would argue,
is the platonic ideal of
the form. Epic enough
in scope to make any
world building fantasy
writer envious, and
acute enough in its
exploration of domestic
intimacy, the four novels
are of that unusual breed
of fiction that doesn’t
seem to be fiction at all.
The series, which
begins with My Brilliant
Friend, follows the lives
of two women born in
Naples just after the
Second World War.
Elena Greco, affection-
ately called Lenu, the
daughter of a porter, and
Raffaella “Lila” Cerullo
the daughter of the local
shoemaker come from
poor families, but both
seem destined to leave
their impoverished
beginning behind. The
two meet in elementary
school where Lenu, a
precocious, conscien-
tious girl, if a little
timid, is top of the class.
In contrast to the well
behaved, rather angelic
Lenu, Lila is half feral.
Scrawny, brash, and apt
to throw stones at the
neighbourhood boys,
Lila, even to the adults
around her, seems just
a little scary. Yet Lila’s
talents extend beyond
causing trouble in the
streets; by the age of
five she has taught
herself to read, and can
do a dizzying number of
sums in her head. Lenu
with all her hard work
must fall behind Lila
and her dazzling talent.
Envy, fascination, and
to some degree a sub-
conscious recognition
that neither of them are
like the other children
around them, draw
the two girls together.
Theirs is a fitful, febrile
friendship that is to last
all their lives.
“Ferrante’s
generously
peopled
bildungs-
roman is set
against a vivid
backdrop
of mob rule,
student riots,
the rise of
the feminist
movement,
the dot com
boom, and a
febrile political
environment”
electric. Written in
the first person from
the grown-up Lenu’s
perspective, it has a
magnetic, confessional
quality. I have seldom
read fiction that so com-
pletely, and so incisively
captures a woman’s
interior life. The quartet
wears its feminist
credentials lightly, but
it is undoubtedly a
deeply feminist work.
As the protagonists of
the books grow older,
the portrayal of an
unconsuming childhood
friendship transitions
into a exploration of the
joys and perils of ado-
lescence; of first love;
of heartbreak; of assault,
then in adulthood there
is the struggle as a
woman to establish
oneself professionally;
the consequences of
staying or leaving an
abusive marriage; the
decision of wanting and
not wanting a child; of
chafing against the roles
of wife and mother.
This is the story of
two lives woven into a
vaguely mystical tale.
Lila and Lenu grow
up in the drudgery of
poverty with the threat
of violence constantly
looming large. Against
this bleak backdrop
commonplace moments
take on a glittering
magic; a dog-eared
copy of Little Women
becomes the roadmap to
a future of riches, a trip
to the sea takes on the
aura of a wild adventure
into the unknown. The
women themselves
become a little larger
than life - set at a time
and in a city where men
beat their wives and
children at the drop of a
hat, the violence of men
is banal, women’s anger
is a different matter:
“men were always
getting furious, they
calmed down in the end;
women, who appeared
to be silent, acquiescent,
when they were angry
flew into a rage that had
no end”. Lila, a little
maenadic at the best
of times, strains at the

confines of personhood
the most. Her energy
and quashed potential
manifest themselves in
odd, violent ways: at
times, copper pots near
her collapse into them-
selves, things by her
seemingly catch alight.
All four books are
a study of tensions
simmering under the
surface threatening to
boil over. This is, after
all, as much a story of
Italy in the latter part of
the 20th
century as it is
of the lives of its central
characters. Ferrante’s
generously peopled
bildungsroman is set
against a vivid backdrop
of of mob rule, student
riots, the rise of the
feminist movement,
the dot com boom, and
a febrile political en-
vironment. Ferrante is
in particular concerned
with class, and money.
When Lenu’s family
scrape together enough
to send her to middle
school, a whole future
opens up to her that will
“Half fairy tale,
half impossibly
real, they are
impossible to
put down or to
forget”
Ferrante’s writing,
translated into English
by Ann Goldstein, is
lead her away from the
neighbourhood she grew
up to a life of money
and culture. Lila, who is
thrown out of a window
by her father when she
brings up the subject
of middle school,
despite her talents, stays
trapped.
“What are the ties that
bind?”, asks Ferrante in
these novels that follow
two lives that grow apart
and come together again
and again; half fairy
tale, half impossibly
real, they are impossible
to put down or to forget.
