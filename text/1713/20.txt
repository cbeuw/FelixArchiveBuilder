Smash Corner-R.O.B- Nintendo’s off-brand Johnny 5
F
ormally known
as the Robotic
Operating Buddy,
he is without a
doubt the most mysterious
and unique character of
the roster, fighter #42,
R.O.B.
Never actually taking
part in a game of his own,
R.O.B. was designed as
a revolutionary gaming
companion for the original
NES. He began as a me-
chanical toy whose goal
was to hype the launch
of the console more than
having a practical or even
remotely useful purpose,
with only two games sup-
porting him. Despite his
poor applicability, R.O.B.
managed to make his first
on-screen appearance in
Super Smash Bros. Brawl
and is now stronger than
ever in Ultimate. He is a
versatile, heavy character
with great long- and short-
range options.
R.O.B.’s most impor-
tant tools are his specials,
starting off with his neutral
Robo Beam, which fires
a directable laser. This
projectile will keep oppo-
nents away with its decent
knockback, but can’t be
used in rapid succession.
Its power recharges pas-
sively, maxing out when
the red LED on top of
R.O.B’s head is flashing.
Next comes the heart of
his kit, his down-special, a
charged attack which fires
a spinning Gyroscope in
front of him. Not only
can this projectile stay on
stage to add pressure, but
R.O.B. (or an opponent)
can pick it up to throw
it again in any direction.
One trick is to launch the
Gyro on the very edge of
the stage, preventing your
opponent from simply
climbing up the ledge.
But in general, you should
use it to harass them from
afar.
Even if your opponent
comes too close, R.O.B.
still has many powerful
options, especially with
his side special, Arm
Rotor. It unleashes a
series of quick attacks
whilst spinning forwards,
followed by a finishing
blow which can kill at
100%. And for the cherry
on top, this move can also
reflect projectiles if timed
right, a lesser known fact
that can take many oppo-
nents by surprise.
And that’s not all,
because R.O.B.’s side-
smash has decent range,
making it the perfect tool
to hit hard whilst at a rea-
sonably safe distance. You
can then follow up with
your neutral-air, which
you should be using a lot,
to hit your opponent with
a fiery blast. All of this
can even be done safely
off-stage thanks to his
up-special Robo Burner,
one of the best vertical
recovery moves in the
game. It will, however,
need some downtime to
recharge its fuel gauge, so
use it sparingly.
In addition to his leg-
endary off-stage mobility
and edge guard, R.O.B.
possesses an insane
combo game. Simple yet
effective, both his down-
and up-throws can be
chained with a multitude
of attacks depending on
the situation. You can
perform tilts or jabs to get
some free damage or try
an up-smash to go for the
kill, if they are at a high
percentage and you are
fast enough. But for all
you Elite Smashers out
there, R.O.B. also has a
masterful zero to death
combo. It makes use of
his Gyro, neutral-air and
side-special to erase one
of your opponent’s stocks
in the right conditions
(check out Beefy Smash
Doods’video for the exact
guide).
As a personal favourite,
I have to say that R.O.B.
is one of the best and most
enjoyable fighters to play.
But objectively, he does
have a lot going for him,
with a lot of versatility,
power and potential,
raising his status up to
high-tier. However, he
can be easily punished if
you are too predictable
due to his large hit-box, so
make sure to use all your
options and mix things up
to successfully destroy
your opponents!
Smash Corner-Jigglypuff- The Elvis of the PokéWorld
T
his pink puff
ball originated in
1996 as one of
the first original
151 Pokémon. However,
it was her popularity in
the anime that got her into
the first Smash game, and
every game since. While
not being as amazing
as she was in Melee,
Jigglypuff has definitely
improved over her last
couple of iterations.
The main game plan
with Jigglypuff is to wall
out the opponent with an
onslaught of aerials while
also setting up tech-chase
situations that can result
in a rest K.O. (more on
this later).
Jigglypuff’s forward air
and back air have a sus-
tained hitbox which stay
out for quite a few frames,
meaning they are excellent
at punishing the opponent
for approaching at the
wrong time. You should
aim to string forward airs
together when you want to
get the opponent off stage
at low percent. Her back
air has insane knock-back
and should be prioritised
at high percent; careful
though, as using this
mid-air causes Jigglypuff
to turn around.
Jigglypuff’s up-air is an
amazing juggling tool at
mid percent and can even
combo into itself. It is not
a great kill option though,
so just use this to rack up
damage.
If you find your
opponent is attacking you
while you’re in shield a
lot, a great option is to
jump out of your shield
and immediately down
air. If done right this is a
free 14% and probably
more if you get off a quick
forward or neutral- air.
Speaking of her neutral
air, it’s a great ‘get off me’
tool, coming out almost
instantly and lasting
nearly half a second.
All of Jigglypuff’s
aerials are made extreme-
ly good by the fact she has
the fastest air speed in the
game, coupled with her 6
jumps!
Jigglypuff’s special
moves are very hit or
miss. Her neutral-special,
Rollout, charges up a
rolling attack that shoots
you forward in a line.
While sometimes useful
as a recovery option, this
should be avoided as it is
very predictable, and a hit
does not do much. Simi-
larly, Sing (her up-special)
does not have much use.
It makes the opponent fall
asleep, allowing you to hit
them, but if you have the
chance to hit the opponent
with this, chances are you
could have just forward
smashed them for the kill.
Her side special Pound
should be used if the
opponent shields a lot as
it does massive shield
damage, but is otherwise
not a great option.
Rest however, being
Jigglypuff’s down special,
is what makes her terri-
fying in the hands of a
skilled player. If you are
overlapping a character,
it will cause massive
damage and knockback,
while also coming out
nearly instantly. But if it
misses, Jigglypuff falls
asleep, and so you should
only use rest if you know
it will hit. Therefore, if
you hit the opponent to the
ground and they tech in a
direction you predicted,
you can chase them and
rest for the kill. There are
some specific rest set ups
that “OneShadyPuff” goes
into detail on in YouTube.
Overall, I would put
The Balloon Pokémon in
mid-tier. While she does
have insane kill power
and great off-stage game,
her limited pool of useful
moves combined with her
being one of the lightest
characters in the game
makes it difficult to win
the abundance of unfa-
vourable matchups she
has. Nevertheless, if you
put the time into getting
good with her you can
definitely wipe the smirk
off your enemies’ faces.
Happy smashing!
