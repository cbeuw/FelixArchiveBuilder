slew of positive changes
Positive changes to Leadership Elections 2019 as
nominations open
aimed at improving the
experience for both can-
didates and voters.
This is the biggest dem-
ocratic exercise at Imperi-
al in which a President and
four Deputy Presidents are
elected as Officer Trustees
to lead Imperial College
Union as paid full-time
leaders for a year. Other
full-time paid positions
are Felix Editor and Im-
perial College School of
Medicine Students’ Union
President, while part time
roles include Council
Chair, Student Trustees,
and eight Liberation &
Community Officers.
Nominations are also
open for the committees
of our six Constituent
Unions, committees for
CSPs, as well as Academ-
ic and Wellbeing Reps at
the departmental level.
Improvements
This year’s Leader-
ship Elections include
improvements based on
feedback from previous
years. There will be more
opportunity for students to
get to know the candidates
and their positions as there
will be a period of cam-
paigning before voting.
Campaigning begins
13:00 on Wednesday 6th
March while voting starts
at noon on Monday 11th
March.
This year’s debate with
candidates for major po-
sitions will be hosted by
ICTV and IC Radio with
a live audience of students
and everyone will get the
opportunity to submit
questions ahead of the
debate on social media.
Another area of
improvement is the com-
plaints process, which
has been streamlined and
made more transparent,
with a clearer appeals
process introduced for
disqualifications and a
daily report on resolu-
tions. There will also be
more time for complaints
handling after the close
of voting, with the results
scheduled 24 hours after
voting closes. Results are
expected to be announced
on Friday 15th
March
during a party at Metric.
Insān - presenting conscious fashion

What is Insan? – our
We have chosen
clothing as our medium
because we see clothes as
an extension of our skin.
They are the fabric that
encase us and surround
us in everything we do.
This makes it the perfect
canvas to present ideas
and challenge issues due
to the huge scope for
which interactions with
our art can take place. In
wearing our art, and con-
veying powerful messag-
es, we encourage people
to explore and challenge
their own beliefs and
established cultural atti-
tudes.
We see modern trends
and behaviours towards
conscious fashion. People
are becoming deeply
aware and selective of the
clothes they choose and
the brands they represent.
This is because a brand has
become much more than a
logo – it is a community of
human beings with shared
ideals, behaviours and
lifestyles. Insān presents a
lifestyle of consciousness.
It is for the individuals
that question and enquire
– who see suffering and
difficulty in the lives of
others and wants to do
something about it. We
are a community who take
action, who show creativ-
ity and present something
that is visually stunning.
By challenging the senses
and creating visually ex-
plorative art - that can be
worn – we encourage you
to question and challenge
The inspiration for
a narrative within each
and every piece of art
produced.
Our second design
explores the concept of
madness and humanity.
The 'Madmen graphic
jeans’ convey an eclectic
counter-cultural message.
On the front the jeans
carry our ‘Insān’ branding
whilst the back conveys
the ‘madmen’ message.
The jeans play on the
double meaning of the
word 'insān' (detailed pre-
viously) and explore this
poignantly. We used fabric
pens to create this design
as they unequivocally
allow us to explore what
human beings can achieve
with the simple marker
pen. The design is remi-
niscent of youthful art and
doodling – the shading of
the margins and borders in
the vibrant red is consist-
ent with this. Meanwhile,
the bold, almost cartoon
style typeface for the
branding is intelligent in
conveying the message of
understanding, like a child
at school learns to under-
stand the world around
them, we encourage you
to understand Insān. The
shadow of madness is ever
present, however, and
shrouds the jeans quite
literally from behind.

gets to the substance of
the brand from the start.
Our first design is named
‘dancing spirits’ and is a
re-imagination of Henri
Matisse’s iconic painting
The Dance. We have
used the silhouettes of the
dancing spirits in our tees
to create a psychedelic
masterpiece that promotes
unity, oneness and un-
derstanding. The image
of dancing is iconic in
the sense that it comes to
the core basics of human
understanding. Through
dance, music and laughter,
we connect and we under-
stand; it is precisely these
feelings that are captured
in this tee.
We used the tech-
nique of spraying due
to its anti-establishment
connotations. There is
something very liberating
about holding a can of

Watching those fine un-

what is wrong in the world
and as a result stimulate
conversation.
Insān will become a
leader in fashion wear and
styling by creating fashion
that matters. Fashion’s
current narrative is a dou-
ble-edged sword. We are
surrounded by fashion that
is spearheaded by cheap,
fast trends and fluctuation
or fashion that is intelli-
gent in its conception and
campaigns, but comes
attached to unachievable
prices. Insān will make
high fashion accessible,
it will make wearing
something meaningful
and beautiful achievable.
We will be a brand that
generates conversation,
tackles wrongful norms
and challenges what you
already know.
The final design we
will explore is the ‘Im-
migrant tee’. This tee is
very special to us as it
was the spark that led to
the conception of Insān.
Our aim was to tackle the
issues surrounding inte-
gration of immigrants into
British society. We were
struck by the negative
narratives used to present
immigrants in the media.
Conversations surround-
ing "British values" and
immigrants incensed us
and cultivated a desire to
challenge these accepted
and omnipresent beliefs.
We thought, "why not
flip this on its head and
challenge people for not
taking the effort to un-
derstand the immigrants
themselves, not taking the
steps to connect with them
as humans and understand
their cultures and beliefs?"
The stamp like ‘Im-
migrant’ print on the
back of the t-shirt give a
blatant and unapologetic
approach to the situation
and works to bring atten-
tion to the concept. Whilst
the simplistic Arabic on
the front contrasts this.
The Arabic depicts the
word “bushri” – another
word for ‘human’ but
using a different dialect
of Arabic. The reason
for this is clear – black
Arabic writing on a white
background carries a vast
array of negative connota-
tions in the media and this
specific combination has
been used as a medium
of scaremongering and
fear-generation in both
the West and the East.
We wanted to reclaim
this, reclaim Arabic for
the beautiful and encom-
passing language it is
and encourage people to
understand immigrants
and people in general for
who they really are. See
beyond the surface.

We are acutely aware of
the problems the human
race face in modern cli-
mates – from issues sur-
rounding the integration
of immigrants, the dis-
sociation and separation
ideologies that infiltrate
modern politics and the
concepts surrounding
religious integration
and acceptance within
communities. Insān aims
to present these issues
through fashion. We not
only shine light on the
issues themselves, but
explore mentalities and
approaches to tackle these
issues.
“We are
surrounded by
fashion that is
spearheaded
by cheap,
fast trends or
fashion that
is intelligent,
but comes
attached to
unachievable
prices ”
we have chosen to do so.
To be part of Insān means
to be part of a collective
that loves and supports
the desire to understand
people. We want to erad-
icate judgment, we want
to encourage unity and we
want to develop networks
between individuals from
anywhere and every-
where. This involves
listening to you - as
fellow inhabitants of this
world, interacting with
your thoughts and beliefs
and listening to what you
want a unifying fashion
brand to look like. Insān
is for the conscious and
the active. These are the
people we want to build
this community with.

the name – and what
does it mean?
The name ‘Insān’ is a
phonetic depiction of the
Arabic word meaning
human. The reason we
pickedthenameisbecause
we wanted to create
something that was true
to our message and true
to our roots. The name, in
its conception, highlights
one of the profound
difficulties that we aim to
challenge. Whilst in the
mother-tongue the word
‘insān’ means human, the
phonetic is very close to
the word ‘insane’ – which
depicts madness. In this
paradigm we present an
interesting narrative -
do we take the time to
understand someone for
the human being they
are, including their roots
and their beauty? Or do
we take the surface-level
understanding and see
someone who is different,
who is strange and who
is ‘mad’ in their practices
and beliefs? Do we treat
each other like madmen,
or embrace each other as
mandem?

Insān’s first line is one
of deep exploration and
us to create something
beautiful.
