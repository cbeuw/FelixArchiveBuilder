A day in the strife - a Xenia student’s morning struggle

How does it feel to
commute via Britain’s
busiest station every day?
I give the rundown, in all
its ‘uncensored’ glory.
It’s 8:10. My body
screams as it’s dragged
from slumber. Goodbye,
sweet dreams of course-
work deadlines and failed
life goals. Welcome to the
waking nightmare that is
reality. The brutality that
exists with existence. The
jet washers at Xenia blast
off my nipples. Good
start. Bring it on, world.
It’s 8:30. I’m out the
door. From jump I get a hit
of pollution straight to the
lungs - definitely not my
drug of choice. A horde
of wild cyclists appear,
cutting through the lights
under the Waterloo double
overpass, charging like
a pack of hyenas in the
African savannah. Right
on cue, a convoy of taxis
pummel through, leading
to clashes filled with
curses and seasoned with
middle fingers. Narrowly
escaping natural selection,
I roll out my A3 tube map
at the roadside, and make
a short prayer to TFL,
my Oyster card and the
Mayor of London, before
continuing onwards.
8:31. That thirty-min-
ute lie-in is coming back
to bite me in the backside.
Decisions, decisions: take
the escalator and descend
into hell straightaway, or
to walk through the main
station and prolong my
suffering for two minutes?
To Bakerloo or not to
Bakerloo (jk that’s not
even a question; we don’t
talk about the Northern
line)Most days walking
through Waterloo’d be
a no-go; with all those
bodies outside everything
shuts down, so it’s shaping
up to be a good day.
Spoke too soon.
8:42 If ever I wondered
how a sardine felt, the
Jubilee line answered
that promptly. I tried to
type part of this article,
but literally, couldn’t
move my arms. Do
Londoners enjoy rubbing
up against one another?
grey - not sure if that’s pa-
thetic fallacy or just all the
sweaty vapour condensing
on my eyeballs.
A few days later, we get
to Westminster, glistening
in all our sweaty glory -
red and slimy like a new
born baby. The doors crisp
pneumatic seal breaks,
allowing the winds of
freedom to gush into the
carriage. The oxygen thins
as I battle upward towards
the Circle and District
line.
Some don’t survive the
climb.
9:?? Again with the
lack of personal space.
A woman coughs filth in
my direction. Suppressing
the urge to vomit takes
everything in me. It’s
almost a losing battle.
That damn sign taunts us all... // Imperial College
Decades pass before the
first train arrives.
So…many…people.
Paralysed with bitterness,
I don’t even attempt to get
on. Limbs stuck in doors.
The second train arrives.
Hopeless. At this point
I give up and walk to St
James’ Park.
Laughing to myself
hysterically, cathartically,
it begins to snow. ‘Why did
I pick Xenia!?’ I cry out.
People start staring, wide
eyes curious, yet devoid of
pathos. They simply don’t
understand… nobody
understands…
Editor’s note: Ah, the
naïveté of a fresher. Wait
till they get to second year.
“mInD tHe DoOrS!”, that
damn woman screeches.
Everything goes a bit
“If ever I
wondered how
a sardine felt,
the Jubilee line
answered that
promptly.“

The Queen’s Tower has
been held under seige
this week by students
demanding College-
wide decolonisation.

T
he movement,
known as ‘Occu-
py QT’ has seen
students holding
the fort of the Queen’s
Tower, after ambushing
bell ringers present to an-
nounce the Queen’s third
cousin’s quinceañera.
The plan, hatched an
executed by the Imperial
Left Forum, was under-
taken by 15 students, the
largest showing of col-
lective political activism
within the College, ex-
cluding the nnual Labour
vs Conservative paintball
match.
Thestudentsinquestion
have laid out a number of
demands, including that
university remove the
term ‘Imperial’ from its
name, henceforth to be
known as ‘Community
College London’, in the
spirit of comraderie.
“This College stands
for everything that was
wrong with the Empire,”
said Roland For-
syth-Tremilton, protester
and second-year Geology
student. “I’d say we tear
it down brick by brick,
but I have a field report
due next week, so I’m
happy to settle for a name
change.”
“Why do we even call it
the Queen’s Tower?,” ex-
claimed Juniper Lee, sec-
retary of the Left Forum,
“it should be named the
People’s Edifice, or even
better, ‘Tour de Corbyn’!”
Marr Anderson,
College CFO (Chief
Frugal Oligarch), was
infuriated by the news.
“First that Divest Imperial
bullshit, now this,” he
said, visibly shaking with
fury, “Next they’ll expect-
ing us be demanding us to
pay staff a living wage!
Ha!”
He was later seen
overheard threatening
Sonia Santabello (Deputy
President, Figures & Sen-
tences), with an eternal
Meat-Free Month on
campus.
Reports suggest that
College Overlord Janice
Fast met with presidents
of the Investment and
Finance Societies in an
effort to quash the inevita-
ble rise of the proletariat.

London’ sees Queen’s Tower under seige
This week you are a bin.
Refer to the Sustainability
section for clarification.
This week you’re Deputy
President, Clubs &
Societies. You seem to
be to only one on CSPB
who cares about the
budgets.
How to fire people who
works for free?
This week, you’re the
Horoscopes writer.
The stars are all chatting
shit this week, so at this
point you fake it till you
make it.
This week you piss in
your housemate’s orange
juice.
Serves her right for eating
your avocado.
This week you’re Alice
Gast. You’re disappointed
to hear about 21 Savage’s
British citizenship -
that’s one less potential
international student to
suck dry.
This week, you try
swapping your usual
hoodie for more snazzy
blazer. Unfortunately
you get mistaken for a
French school kid and get
shepherded into class.
Asseyez-vous!
This week you’re Sport
Imperial.
You would’ve got away
with the money too, if it
weren’t for those pesky
kids.
This week you walk into
the Union office with a
Snickers, forgetting it’s
now nut-free.
You get rugby tackled by
the DPW before you even
get through the door.
This week you’re the
Felix Editor. You hear
that Liam Neeson’s doing
promo at the Albert Hall..
Guess who’s not leaving
the Felix office anytime
soon?
This week you faceplant
in the South Ken tunnel
whilst running late for
your lectures.
Nothing like a rush of
blood to the head to get
the day started.
This week, you’re the
library security guard.
They don’t pay you
enough to deal with this
shit.
