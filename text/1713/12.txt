Brexit and Disability?

A
s you are prob-
ably aware,
ever since the
invocation of
Article 50 on 29th
March
2017, the entire country
hasbeenon-edge.Whether
you are a ‘brexiteer’ or a
‘remainer’, everyone’s
fear of the unknown and
split opinions have made
the process of leaving
ever more… complicated,
to say the least.
How are local busi-
nesses and multinational
corporations affected by
this? What would the
transition period mean to
trade and immigration?
Are we going to remain in
the single market? What
about the customs union?
Are we going to have a
free-trade agreement?
What about the Backstop
and Ireland? Are we going
to have free movement?
What about farming
and fishing? What about
research funding? When
do we get that £350m/
week for the NHS? What
impact does Brexit have
on the lives of people with
disabilities?
sound familiar as they
have, and still are, being
discussed (rightly so!).
But what about that last
one? Is there even any
relationship between the
quality of life of people
with disabilities and
Brexit? Spoiler Alert! Yes.
Laws:
The EU Withdrawal
Act converts current EU
law into domestic law as
we leave ensuring enough
time for the UK to either
modify or remove some
or all of the EU laws after
thorough thought and
discussion. The act also
allows corrections to be
made to laws that are no
longer applicable once
we leave straight away.
However, which EU laws
apply to people with disa-
bilities?
The UK has generally
been very good with dis-
ability laws and legisla-
tions; for example, when
the UK passed the Chron-
ically Sick and Disabled
Persons Act in 1970, it
was the first legislation in
the world to recognise and
award rights to disabled
people. In 1995 the Disa-
bility Discrimination Act
(DDA) was introduced,
which included education,
transport, and the provi-
sion of goods, facilities,
services, premises, em-
ployment and occupation.
However, businesses with
fewer than 20 employees
were protected if they dis-
criminated on grounds of
disability. This exemption
was removed from UK
law in 2004 after the EU
legislation, the Frame-
work Directive for Equal
Treatment in Employment
and Occupation, came
into effect in 2000.
In 2008, discrimination
against employees due
to their carer status or
relationship to a disabled
person became unlawful
in the UK as a result
of a European Court of
Justice Judgement. This
was an issue that was
missed in the DDA and
many people had suffered
from ‘discrimination by
association’. Imagine the
impact of being discrimi-
nated against due to your
relative/child/partner
being disabled. Not only
would this put massive
stresses on the family’s
financial situation but
also stress the relation-
ships with the disabled
person. Not only that but
the mental stress that is
placed onto the disabled
person, knowing that their
family is unemployable
because of their disability
is immense and this is in
addition to all the other
mental stresses that come
with a disability.
Finance:
There is no doubt that
most disabilities incur
extra costs to the person.
Whether it is healthcare
costs, transport costs or
equipment costs. The UK
government understands
this, and has created
Personal Independence
Payments (PIP) to support
people with the extra
costs, allowing them to
independently contribute
to society. The EU’s regu-
lation on the coordination
of social security systems
means that British
citizens eligible for PIP
can continue to receive it
whilst living in another
EU country, extending the
person’s independence
across the continent.
Not only that but
making the country more
accessible and removing
the barriers faced by
people with disabilities in
society requires re-plan-
ning and costs. The EU
supports the UK with
these costs through the
EU Structural and Invest-
ment Funds – which place
a great deal of emphasis
on anti-poverty and social
inclusion measures.
The Future:
The European Acces-
sibility Act, proposed
in 2015, aims to set
requirements for products
and services, such that
they are more accessible.
For example, trains and
busses to be designed
with accessibility in
mind and cash machines
to have headphone jacks
for the visually impaired,
amongst other things.
Leaving the EU would
prevent people with dis-
abilities from benefiting
from upcoming EU legis-
lation on accessibility.
Although the UK
has been a pioneer in
disability and inclusivity
legislations, the EU has
helped to shape and refine
the rules, such that no one
is excluded and secondary
issues of disability are
accounted for. Leaving
the EU would not cause
a massive change in disa-
bility laws straight away;
however, the UK would
then be able to ‘roll back’
some of the EU laws that
protect and enable the in-
dependence of those with
disabilities. This reduces
the power of the voice of
people with disabilities as
there would be a reduction
in the domain of advocacy.
Will the UK decide
to ‘roll back’ the laws?
I personally think that’s
unlikely (or at least I
would like to think so),
since the UK government
has a proven track record
of caring for those with
disabilities. Also, more
recently, The Papworth
Trust suggested that the
UK is one of the best
EU members in terms
of treatment of disabled
people. Could financial
help provided for people
with disabilities abroad
be affected? I think that
would be one of the most
likely changes we will see.
I do however believe that
some collaboration with
the EU around disability

inclusivity legislations, the EU has helped to shape and

If you’ve been follow-
ing the Brexit process, all
these questions should
will be beneficial as there
would be a much bigger
pool of experience to
enable us to create the best
laws. Even if it’s just for
humanitarian purposes.
