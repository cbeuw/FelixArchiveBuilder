Why I’m proposing a complete restructure of
the Union
Students have been complaining for years that the Union makes decisions without consulting
its members or volunteers. It’s time for the old structures to be torn down and for a new
democratic, transparent, accessible and member-led Union to take its place.

ow much of
a say do we
really have
in what the
Union does? Whether
introducing sweeping
changes such as a whole
new representation
network (the Wellbeing
Rep Network), imple-
menting programmes like
ICXP (Imperial Clubs
Experience Project),
tampering with election
timetables (Leadership
Elections 2018), or
removing meat from
the menus (Meat-Free
Monday), the Union
always acts according to
the whims of those at the
top. Consultation of mem-
bers is seldom carried out
and even consultation with
Union Council members
is virtually non-existent.
I know this because I
have sat on Council for a
year and a half, and many
fellow Council members
agree with me when I say
that we feel locked out.
Union Council is meant
to be the main represent-
ative body of the Union,
setting policy and deter-
mining the direction of
the Union in collaboration
with the sabbs (President
+ Deputy Presidents).
However, what has Union
Council actually done? I
can list a few good results
to come out of Council,
such as introducing
harsher punishments for
student volunteers found
guilty of sexual harass-
ment, and when it voted to
supportourstaffduringthe
pensions dispute last year.
Having been on the picket
lines on the majority of
the strike days and talking
to staff, I know it made a
real difference for them
to hear that students back
them against the universi-
ty leadership.
However, the current
system is an incredibly in-
accessible and inefficient
way to create policy. Most
students don’t even realise
that they can write a
Council paper. Even when
a paper gets to Council,
the debate is often poor
and gets stuck on small
technicalities. People talk
over each other and points
are left unaddressed. Even
after a motion passes this
doesn’t guarantee change.
If the Union doesn’t
actually implement
motions nothing changes!
This is a pressing issue
as there are numerous
motions that have gotten
past Council that Union
has not yet implemented.
Last year I proposed
a motion for a petitions
system that would make
it easier for students
to propose motions. A
watered down version
of this was passed in
February 2018, with an
implementation date of
the Autumn Term 2018.
At this point in time, it
has been “indefinitely
delayed”. Two separate
papers proposing a Social
Mobility Liberation
Officer were submitted
last year amidst reports
that Imperial was the
most unequal university
in England. There was
a wide show of support
from normal students
for the motion – Council
decided to instead run a
consultation on it. Again,
this has yet to be carried
out despite it being
mandated by Council.
The one time lots of
normal students showed
up to Council, they were
completely ignored.
This is the result not
of the specific people
running the Union, but of
the structure of the Union
itself. It’s why the situa-
tion stays the same every
year despite different
people being elected into
those positions. It doesn’t
matter who you vote for
because the system itself
is rotten. Any system that
primarily empowers those
at the top rather than the
mass membership is a
fundamentally flawed
system, regardless of who
is running things.
Now this isn’t an
argument to not vote in
the upcoming Leadership
Elections – please make
sure you do. The argument
is that although the Union
prides itself on being
having very low turnout,
there simply wasn’t
enough momentum to
take it off the ground.
This is why I have
proposed a motion to the
next Union Council for
the Union to set in motion
a complete restructure
of itself that prioritises
democracy, transparency,
and accountability. It
needs to become mem-
ber-led – meaning that
all us students, together,
are leading the way and
setting policy. It needs
to empower anyone who
wishes to get involved and
it needs to act upon what
the student body wants,
effectively and efficient-
ly. However, this is too
important a decision to be
left solely to Council. The
restructure will be devel-
oped in a group consisting
of a wide range of students
such as sabbs, academic
and wellbeing reps, CSP
committee members,
and most importantly,
normal students like you.
Everyone should get a say
in what the new Union
looks like: a member-led
Union brought about by a
member-led process.
This is where you
come in. Union Council
must first set in motion
this process so that we
can get started on devel-
oping a new system for
next year. Contact your
Council Reps to ensure
they vote for this, contact
me (ab4616@ic.ac.uk) if
you have any ideas, and
most importantly, feel free
to turn up to the meeting
on Tuesday, at 6:30pm in
RSM G1 to talk to your
representatives and to
show your support!

democratic, it thinks that
democracy is simply
voting in an election
every now and then. Real
democracy is all year
round. Our voices deserve
to be heard and our wishes
deserve to be acted upon
throughout the year,
because it’s our Union.
It is an organisation that
is meant to represent us
collectively, and it’s about
time it did. In fact, talks
were had in mid-2018
between last year’s Union
President and volunteers
about a radical change
in the way the Union is
run, with some very good
ideas being proposed. The
President at the time felt
strongly that Council was
inaccessible and wanted
to bring about something
new. However, with the
meetings being advertised
almost exclusively to
Council members and
