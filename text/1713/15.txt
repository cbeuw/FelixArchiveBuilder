ndex funds refer to
a mutual fund or
Exchange Traded
Fund (ETF) that
track a specified basket
of underlying securities
(tradable financial assets).
Moreover, ETFs are
becoming an increasingly
popular investment ve-
hicle amongst both retail
and institutional investors.
More than 4,500 ETFs
managed over 4.46 trillion
USD worth of assets in
2017. ETFs, in essence,
are securities that are
listed on stock exchanges
and can be traded just like
stocks. An ETF tracks a
basket of securities that
could range from indexes,
stocks, bonds, to even
commodities. Popular
ETFs include the SPDR
S&P 500 ETF (SPY) that
tracks the S&P500 Index,
Vanguard Total Stock
Market ETF (VTI) that
tracks the market-capital-
isation weighted index of
the entire U.S. equities
market, and the United
States Oil Fund (USO)
that tracks the price of
West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) light, sweet crude
oil.
Since ETFs are traded
on the stock exchange,
they are priced and traded
continuously throughout
a trading day. Moreover,
ETFs can be sold short
or bought long and are
traded just like stocks.
One main advantage
that ETFs offer is the
low-cost diversification
to minimise unsystematic
risk during investing. For
instance, mutual funds –
professionally managed
investment funds which
pool small sums of
money from various retail
investors to buy a basket
the emergence of ETFs
with high leverages.
Leveraged ETFs increases
exposure to a certain
index or asset class and
an example would be
triple-leveraged ETFs
that triple the exposure
for an investor. Some
popular triple-leveraged
ETFs would be Direxion
Daily Financial Bull 3X
share (Ticker: FAS) or
ProShares UltraPro Short
S&P500 (Ticker: SPXU),
with FAS holding a long
position for financial
sector stocks and SPXU
holding a short position
for S&P500 index.
Nevertheless,leveraged
ETFs have a multitude
of flaws and inherent
riskiness associated with
them. Naïve investors
would believe that triple-
leveraged ETFs would
produce triple the daily
return for the underlying
investment (i.e. triple
the return of the index in
the long term). However,
in the long term, such
leveraged ETFs have a
negative bias and would
rarely match triple the
underlying investment
performance. Let’s
demonstrate this in the
following example:
suppose we are tracking
an index that starts at
$100 and increases by
30% on the first day
($130) and falls 10% on
the second day ($117) and
falls another 20% on the
last day ($93.6) with an
overall net loss of 6.4%
over the 3 day period. The
triple-leveraged index
increases the exposure
by 3 times, i.e. a loss
of 20% is magnified to
60%. Suppose the triple-
leveraged index starts at
$100, at the end of the first
day, it increases by 90%
($190), decreases by 30%
on the second day ($133)
and decreases by 60%
on the last day ($53.2).
Overall, the net loss to an
investor would be 46.8%.
This demonstrates the
negative bias of a triple-
leveraged index which
negative bias inherent to
leveraged ETFs dictates
that such ETFs should
not be held as a long-
term investments but
should be used instead
by professional traders
who use them as a hedge
against big market moves
in the short term. Jack
Bogle criticised leveraged
or inverse ETFs investors
as “Fruitcakes, Nut Cases
and Lunatic Fringes”.
While broad-based ETFs
can act to diversify risk,
retail investors need to be
wary of exotic ETFs that
tend to suffer from higher
volatility.
of securities – charge
higher fees (average of
0.51% expense ratio)
relative to ETFs (average
of 0.21% expense ratio,
with some brokers even
offering commission-free
ETFs).
Moreover, the passive
investing nature of
ETFs aims to track the
performance of major
indexes (e.g. S&P500 or
FTSE100), that provides
returns that are similar
to that of active fund
managers that own
a diversified market
portfolio. According to
Jack Bogle, the founder of
the Vanguard Group and
one of the pioneers of the
index funds movement,
who believes in the cost-
matters hypothesis that
posits why index funds
are so successful: The
net return to an investor
is equal to the gross
return in the market as
a whole, less the costs
of obtaining that return.
(Surprisingly, Jack Bogle
is not a staunch supporter
of the efficient market
hypothesis that postulates
the best way to beat the
market would be to invest
solely in the indexes.)
Given that passive index
funds provide a similar
return to active fund
managers at a much lower
administrative cost, the
net return for a passive
index fund would be
higher than the net returns
for active investing with
fund managers in the long
run.
With the rising
popularity of ETFs, a
multitude of niche ETFs
targeted at niche areas
of the market such as the
biotech and healthcare
sector e.g. HealthShares
Emerging Cancer ETF or
even socially responsible
ETFs catered towards
ESG investors.
Since ETFs are
generally more passive
and track a basket of
securities, this has led to

ccording to The
Global Impact
I n v e s t i n g
N e t w o r k
(GIIN), impact invest-
ment can be defined as
investment made into
companies, organisations,
and funds with the inten-
tion to generate social
and environmental impact
alongside a financial
return. Hence, impact
investing in Africa is the
deployment of investment
in African companies,
organisations, and funds
with intentions to gen-
erate social, health, and
environmental impact
alongside a financial
return. It is important
to note that categorical
impact investing in Africa
is significantly different
from charitable aids given
to Africa as the latter
does not usually drive
investment / financial
rewards for the charity
giver. Impact investment
in Africa attracts a broad
range of investors, pri-
marily fund managers,
development finance
institutions, institutional
investors, and founda-
tions. There is a broad
range of asset classes
the reality. According to
a UNDP study “Impact
Investment in Africa:
Trends, Constraints and
Opportunities”, the 9 key
challenges facing impact
investment in Africa are:
1. General lack of
awareness and
understanding of
impact investment;
2. Difficulty in sourcing
viable investments
that meet both
financial and social/
environmental
objectives in Africa;
3. Limited availability
of innovative fund
and deal structures;
4. Difficulty exiting
investments;
5. Poor visibility
and inadequate
recognition of social
enterprise status;
6. Lack of capital
supply across the
risk/return spectrum;
7. Inadequate policy
and regulatory
environment;
8. Poor linkages
between social
enterprise, investors,
and innovation
networks; and
9. Poor and inconsistent
impact measurement
practice.
In order to address the
highlighted challenges
facing impact investment
in Africa, the Impact
Investment Action Plan
wasdevelopedasshownin
Figure 1. The primary aim
of the Impact Investment
in Africa Action Plan is to
support the development
of a vibrant impact
investment sector on the
African continent. The
overarching vision is the
development of a vibrant
impact investment sector
in Africa. The stated
vision is further supported
with five key intermediate
outcomes and a supporting
pan-African action plan
and action network as in
Figure 2.
One of the leading
UK impact investment
firms with an African
focus is Uhusiano
Capital Ltd. Uhusiano
Capital is a boutique,
regulated, financial
advisory firm based in
London with a specialist
team primarily focused
on impact investment in
Africa. Uhusiano Capital
addresses the capital
needs for African-based
projects and opportunities.
The firm is driven
by a strong founding
principle grounded in the
fundamental belief that
commercial capital and
impact/social capital can
come together to generate
sustainable long-term
projects/funds/products
in Africa. Founded in
2016 and incorporated
in 2017 by Christelle
Kupa, Uhusiano Capital
has grown to establish
its expertise in three key
domains: capital raising,
deal flow origination and
strategic marketing.
Uhusiano Capital’s
capital raising team offers
an innovative approach
to raising capital for
exceptional projects
and/or companies by
utilising its deep and well-
entrenched experience
in the impact investment
community in African
markets. By utilising its
innovative capital raising
approach, Uhusiano
Capital is able to bridge
the gap between impact
investors and impact
opportunities in a unique
and transformational way.
Uhusiano Capital’s
capital deal flow
origination team are world
leaders in harnessing the
vast global network to

whether new or well-
experienced, to clearly
and objectively identify
the most talented and
undiscovered mangers
and projects in order to
achieve their investment
objectives: financial and
social/impact gains.
Navigating the African
impact investment
ecosystem is challenging,
difficult, and sometimes
almost impossible.
Uhusiano Capital’s
strategic marketing team
over the years have
developed revolutionary
strategic marketing
solutions and impact
investment advisory
teams and services
to make navigating
and marketing impact
investments in Africa
simple, effective, and
rewarding. Furthermore.
Uhusiano Capital’s
strategic marketing
team provides strategic
recommendations and
deep insights for making
meaningful marketing
of impact investments in
Africa.
In conclusion, Impact
Investment in Africa has
a gigantic potential to
revitalise, recapitalise
and rejuvenate
African economies,
African projects,
African businesses
and most importantly,
African people.
However, fundamental
understanding of the
conceptual imperatives
of Impact Investing
in African and the
practicality and nuisances
of impact investing in
Africa is central and at
the heart of whether or
not impact investment
will deliver on its lofty
potentials in Africa. A
strong belief in innovative
and philosophical driven
firms with Africa-focused
impact investment
and Africa expertise
like Uhusiano Capital
plays a significant role
in translating impact
investment concepts into
financial returns and
social/environmental
impacts in African
economies.
which includes: equity,
commodity, fixed income,
foreign exchange, proper-
ty, and derivates. Actual
numerical quantification
and data on the market
size of impact investing
in Africa remains very
limited.
The Sustainable
Development Goals
(SDGs) framework
developed by United
Nations serves as a driving
force and framework
for impact investing in
Africa. An Annual Impact
Investor Survey report
by The GIIN showed
that more than half of
impact investors are
tracking some or all of
their performance against
SDGs. Furthermore,
there is strong appetite
for impact investors to
catalyse impact investing
towards SDGs. However,
the United Nations
continues to argue the
case for more capital and
investment deployment
to drive and grow impact
investing in Africa and on
a global scale. The UN
estimates that USD 5-7
trillion is needed annually
to achieve the goals.
Impact investing
has been hailed as a
transformational and
revolutionary investment
methodology for
revitalising and growing
African economies.
However, the vision is
increasingly distant from
