T
he American
election of 2020
is still 600 days
away, yet even in
the British press there is
at least one article a day
on any declared or even
potential candidates to
challenge Donald Trump.
Yet very little focus
has been given by the
international press to the
biggest election in human
history that will take place
this spring. India is the
world biggest democracy
with almost 900 million
registered voters and
this year’s Lok Sabha
elections (India’s Lower
House of Parliament) is
a wide open contest, with
no clear winner in sight.
Before we move forward,
let us recognise the impor-
tant role Imperial College
has played in India’s
widely respected Election
Commission. It was an
alumnus of our univer-
sity, Sukumar Sen, who
served as independent
India’s first Chief Election
Commissioner and was
tasked to do the improba-
ble: conduct a multi-party
election in a country that’s
80% illiterate in 1950. Of
the many challenges that
await India in the coming
decades, the survival of
democracy is not one
of them. In the last 70
years each succeeding
government has peace-
fully transferred power.
This by no means was a
pre-ordained feat – India’s
neighbourhood is crowded
with failed states, military
dictatorships and the most
powerful communist
regime in the world.
In many regards the
upcoming election is
not one election, but
many regional ones with
regional leaders con-
fronting regional issues.
For India is a microcosm
of the United Nations,
with 22 major languages
(with over a million
native speakers each) and
significant religious and
cultural diversity.
In 2014, Narendra
Modi’s party (BJP)
achieved what no other
Indian Prime Minister
achieved since Rajiv
Gandhi’s landslide victory
in 1984, that is to win an
outright parliamentary
majority. Yet, if current
polls are to be believed,
then coalition govern-
ments are set to return.
Coalitions in India are
never between two parties,
but as in 2004 to 2014, the
governing coalition con-
sisted of over 22 political
parties with a further 8
parties providing external
support. The current Lok
Sabha consists of 36
parties – now that’s a true
multi-party system.
In season three of
Blackadder, set in
Georgian England,
Blackadder informs
Baldrick (representing the
common man) that to be
an MP a criminal record
is a prerequisite. Whilst
the UK has moved away
from the rotten boroughs
of the nineteenth century,
in India progress moves
more slowly. The wide
scale criminalisation of
politics has meant that
whichever party you vote
for, one thing will always
be constant, at least a third
of MPs will have serious
criminal cases against
them. Now that is true
bipartisanship. However,
saying that, it would
be lazy to fall victim to
bothsidesism, and not
recognise the significant
differences and policy
records.
A year and a half ago,
the Modi-led BJP NDA
(national democratic
alliance) government
seen genuine economic
improvements with India
achieving its best rank
on the World Bank ease-
of-doing-business index
and strong GDP growth
figures (+7%) whilst con-
trolling inflation to below
3%, ultimately Modi has
become a victim of unre-
alistic promises he made
back in 2014. Persistently
high joblessness, agricul-
tural distress resulting in
indebted farm workers
and high non-performing
asset ratio amongst India’s
state-owned banks have
stifled the true potential of
India’s economy. Amidst
this disappointed climate,
the opposition has sensed
its opportunity. To prevent
a repeat of 2014, opposi-
tion parties have united
to form an anti-BJP coali-
tion, often with their past
enemies, realising that
only a united opposition
can stop the Modi jugger-
naut. The past few months
have seen the BJP falter
in the Hindi-speaking
heartland, which played a
vital role in their success
in 2014. From losing
the chief-ministership in
Madya Pradesh, Rajasthan
and Chhattisgarh to even
loosing key by-elections
in the all-important state
of Uttar Pradesh.
Yet behind the facade
of opposition unity, there
is already tension brewing
over who would be the
prime-ministerial candi-
date. The only pan-India
political party other than
the BJP is the Congress
party (which has ruled
India for 50 of the 70 years
since independence). Con-
sequently, many Congress
leaders have publicly said
that any prime-ministe-
rial candidate must come
from within their party.
This has irked many
regional leaders who have
ambitions of their own.
Despite the re-energised
spirit shown by Rahul
Gandhi, president of the
Congress party and the
heir to the Nehru-Gandhi
political dynasty (no
relation to Mahatma
Gandhi), the Indian youth
have grown tired of
dynastic politics. India is a
young country, with 65%
of the population under
the age of 35 living in a
highly competitive world.
It is no wonder that in the
last election, the youth
overwhelmingly voted for
the candidate who repre-
sented meritocracy. Modi
didn’t have a famous po-
litical family nor wealth to
buy his way to power - he
is a self-made man who,
in his youth, use to sell tea
on railway stations.
In the wide canopy of
mud-slinging attacks, the
real issues facing voters
are getting ignored. The
rising economic inequal-
ity, the abject failure of
state education and the
absolute absence of public
healthcare has been but
on the back-burner of po-
litical discourse. Instead
of real policy debates
to reduce crime and the
necessary judicial reforms
or the necessary policies
required to protect the
environment, the Indian
media has chosen to focus
its attention to partisan
politics devoid of any
substance. Take the recent
budget presented by
the government – little
attention has been paid
to the details on how to
finance the proposed uni-
versal healthcare scheme,
despite there being
numerous 24/7 news
channels. However plenty
of media coverage has
been given to Mr Modi’s
rhetorical zingers for
example “BC stands for
before Congress, and AD
stands for after Congress”,
with the Times of India
dedicating their front page
to it. Some things truly are
international.
In the past, the Indian
electorate has fallen
victim to identity politics
and voting for leaders
based on religion, caste,
language and ethnicity.
However, time and time
again, Indian voters
have also demonstrated
their ruthlessness against
incumbents who failed to
meet their promises. Will
the same befall Modi?
