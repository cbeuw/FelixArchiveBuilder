C
ultist Simulator,
as you can guess
from the name,
is an indie game
designed to simulate
creating and running a
cult, which was released
by Weather Factory on
31st
May 2018. This is all
I knew when I opened the
game for the first time to
live-tweet a playthrough.
It’s been two weeks since
then and I have somehow
logged another 60 hours.
Cultist Simulator is a truly
brilliant, and incredibly
complex, game!
The biggest flaw I
could argue there is within
the game is purely how
complex it is – and that
it makes no attempt to
hold your hand. For this
reason, I’d advise against
going into the game
knowing as little as I did
– you will enjoy the game
much more if you go into
the game with at least a
vague idea of what the
gameplay pattern is and
how to progress towards
victory. However, the
complexity of this game is
also its strongest feature.
Cultist Simulator is a
real passion project from
Weather Factory, which
is evident in the attention
to detail and sheer depth
available – after 62 hours I
don’t think I’m anywhere
close to scratching the
surface of what this game
has to offer, and I’ve
certainly not managed to
beat the game yet (though
I’d like to think I’ve been
close). Not to mention
that the game is still
being tweaked and in the
process of having addi-
tional content added – the
creators can’t seem to get
enough of it either!
The atmosphere in
the game is perfect – the
aesthetics and soundtrack
combine beautifully to
create a strong sense of
immersion. The music
reminds me a surprising
amount of Jeff Wayne’s
War of the Worlds album,
if that album were to be
transposed to be about
the occult rather than
the alien. I have found
myself a couple of times
dawdling on the title
screen for 15-20 minutes
at a time before actually
starting a run of the
game so I can listen to
the music without the
gameplay loop drawing
my attention. When you
consider that all story-
telling & advancement is
done purely via text, it is
incredible that the game
has an atmosphere at all,
“After 62 hours
I don’t think

“Alexis
Kennedy and
Lottie Bevan
are two of the
wonderful
Guests of
Honour for the
36th
Picocon
on the 16th
February”
let alone one that seems
to perfectly conjure up its
Lovecraftian inspirations.
The gameplay itself
looks rather simple – you
have four main resources
you need to manage,
including your money;
going broke will cause
you to fall ill or die. The
more different actions you
try, the more ‘cards’you’ll
have to experiment with.
These cards can represent
anything from places,
to occult objects, to
members of your cult, or
even the police detective
trying desperately to find
the right evidence to shut
down your cult. You’d be
forgiven for thinking the
gameplay was simplistic
at first: click on a ‘box’
labelled something like
work, give it a card that
it would make sense to
do work with, wait a
short period of time and
be told what the outcome
was. Even this system
is much more complex
than it appears to begin
with – different card com-
binations can massively
change your outcomes,
and some events occur
part way through the
duration, allowing you to
add other cards into the
box as well and so alter
the result.
I cannot overstate how
much I recommend this
game – if any part of it
at all seems like it may
interest you, read up
on it a little or watch a
couple of YouTube videos
before taking the plunge.
I promise it’ll be worth
your time. There is a
quote from an anonymous
fan on Weather Factory’s
website that I rather like:
“How to tell if you’re in
an Alexis Kennedy story:
There is no right choice.
There is no wrong choice.
There is only living with
what you’ve done…”
and Cultist Simulator
once again embodies this
Have you ever had the desire to start your own cult? Well here you go! // Weather Factory
“In an Alexis
Kennedy story:
There is no
right choice.
There is no
wrong choice.
There is only
living with
what you’ve
done…”
feeling. (Alexis Kennedy
is one of the two founding
members of Weather
Factory, alongside Lottie
Bevan.)
If you are at all in-
trigued by the narratives
weaved within this game,
or the visuals, or in fact
anything at all that this
game has to offer (and
you should be), then you
will be thrilled to hear
that not just one but both
of the founding members
of Weather Factory are
coming to Imperial for
a talk! Alexis Kennedy
and Lottie Bevan are two
of our wonderful Guests
of Honour for the 36th
Picocon on the 16th
of
February, and considering
the theme this year is
‘Intrigue’, it would be
pure folly to miss their
joint talk!
This talk and those of
our three other Guests of
Honour, each a fantastic
science-fiction author,
will take place on 16th
in
Blackett’s Lecture Theatre
1, as well as many other
Intriguing (please forgive
me, but I’ve been told I
need to work more puns
into our Picocon public-
ity) events – including
the perennial Destruction
of Dodgy Merchandise,
which involves smashing
odd bits of pop-culture
with liquid nitrogen and
a hammer. If any of these
things interest you at all
then please grab yourself
a ticket from the Union
store! I hope to see as
many of you there on the
day as possible.
