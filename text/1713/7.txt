Fashion is not a real thing
This week’s grumpy bastard’s cynicism falls heavy on the industry, almost as heavy as the
Supreme brick.

I
deeply despise fash-
ion. Whether it’s the
pretentious designers
selling a branded
brick for a tonne of money,
or the gormless idiots that
buy it, everything in the
fashion world is designed
to piss me off. Apparently,
however, it is one of the
things many people at
Imperial enjoy and have
a serious interest in, so as
always, allow me to lower
my trousers, unclench my
arse cheeks and defecate
all over your vacuous
hobby.
To begin with, I deeply
mistrust an art form that
mostly involves watching
how fabrics hang off mal-
nourished human bodies.
Hats off to the generations
of fashion designers that
have successfully brain-
washed young people into
anorexia and unhealthy
body images. You are
probably responsible for
so many mental health
issues and eating disor-
ders that I would applaud,
except I’m busy ramming
cotton wool down my
throat. Delicious.
I hasten to point out that
as an industry, the suffer-
ing fashion imposes on its
models is hardly the worst
bit. The poor bastards that
are employed to create
the clothes that you enjoy,
and I wear because nudity
is illegal, get to enjoy
highly unsafe working
conditions coupled with
being children. Who
needs education when you
can be crushed to death in
a factory collapse? Cer-
tainly not me. However,
that is the unfortunate
nature of the industry,
to produce vast amounts
cheap rubbish and
underpay their workers
before slapping a big fat
brand price increase. I’m
not sure what reveals
more about human nature,
much flammable crap that
every so often, they have
to burn millions of pounds
worth of product just so
they can keep selling it for
extortionate amounts of
money.
The funny thing is
that people will continue
to buy this shit. In an
effort to live the brand
“lifestyle” and flex over
all their friends, middle
class cunts will continue
to invest in this clothing.
What a waste of human
life.
the fact that people think
they can do this or the fact
that people buy the damn
things anyway.
High fashion certainly
exhibits this in spades,
with the delightful high
heeled crocs by Balen-
ciaga costing an entirely
reasonable $500 a pop,
or the aforementioned
Supreme brick. One of the
methods that these com-
panies use to keep their
prices high is destruction
of unsold stock. Burberry
famously produces so
