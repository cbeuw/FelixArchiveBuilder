Biff’s Jack Shack: turning jackfruit into fast
food is not just for the vegans
In an effort to stay current and #OnTrend, resident Felix treehuggers Simran and Rhid try out the first in a series of
veggie and vegan food outlets to keep things moving post-Veganuary.

Food Writers
T
he past 12 months
have been more
vegan inspired
than ever; in fact,
2018 was the year of the
vegan. Last year saw
sales of meat-free food
increase by a staggering
987%, with everyone
from Beyonce to Benedict
Cumberbatch getting in
on the action. Like it or
not, plant based (read:
vegan) food is here to
stay. But saving the planet
doesn’t have to mean sac-
rificing culinary pleasure,
or indeed saving your
own body; while in days
gone by the first casualty
of a meat-free diet was
fast food, today’s veggies
and vegans have plenty of
options that hit both those
salty and sugary sweet
spots. Both authors being
vegetarians who’ve strug-
gled to commit entirely to
veganism, who better to
give the verdict on vegan
junk food?
The setting
Boxpark Shoreditch: If
you’ve ever been to a con-
tainer park before, you’ll
feel like you already
know this place pretty
well – the usual blend
of hipster brunch joints
and edgy chip shops are
all here. Things are kept
nice and simple upstairs:
communal bench seating
and plenty of natural light
give it a relaxed, airy feel.
Points for having a well-
stocked bar, which would
be great on a summer
afternoon; we went in the
pissing rain instead.
The food
Biff’s Jack Shack
(BJS) gets its name from
jackfruit, a large fruit
native to India. Neither
“We were
unanimous in
our feelings
towards the
aioli: this
is the most
impressive
part of the
whole meal”
“On all counts,
the Big Jack
burger passes
with flying
colours – this is
no stodgy Big
Mac”
of us had tried jackfruit in
any of its guises before.
BJS managed to create an
entire menu from it, with
the classic jackfruit-as-
pulled-pork fare joined
by innovative jackfruit
burgers, wings, and chilli.
Wings
Our introduction to
jackfruit came in the
form of buffalo ‘wings’,
complete with blue
‘cheese’ dip. Immediately,
it’s clear why jackfruit
lends itself so easily to
pulled pork; its stringy,
fibrous texture is unlike
any other vegetable. BJS
have a really good stab at
working the jackfruit into
something chicken-esque,
and while it’s unlikely to
fool a regular at KFC, the
wingsworkwellenoughto
be enjoyable in their own
right, complete with sugar
cane ‘bones’. The chefs
seem to really know their
star ingredient, with an
extra crispy breadcrumb
coating guarding against
jackfruit’s tendency to
go a bit mushy. Our only
criticisms would be of
the accompaniments; the
buffalo sauce is a little on
the sharp side, even for
those who usually douse
their chips in vinegar, and
the blue ‘cheese’ doesn’t
have enough in the tank to
stand up to it. Maybe try
one of the other wings…
Burgers
What do you want in
a burger? As far as we’re
concerned, a burger’s
function is essentially
to satisfy that desire
for something solid,
something heavy, that
fills a hole when you’re
absolutely famished or to
fill your stomach before a
solid night out. It doesn’t
have to be meat, or even
meaty – a satisfying bite
and some decent relish is
all we ask for.
On all counts, the Big
Jack burger passes with
flying colours. The Big
Jack is BJS’s entry-level
offering, and at £7.50
straddles fast food and
gourmet burger pricing.
This is no stodgy Big Mac,
though; everything – from
the wholesome seeded
bun, to the genuinely
fresh and crisp lettuce,
to the burger sauce that
you’d swear is the non-ve-
gan original – everything
suggests quality. The
jackfruit patty itself offers
plenty of texture and sub-
stance, although you’d be
hard pressed to pin down
its flavour in amongst
everything else. Trying
it by itself (sans bun,
salad, sauce), the patty’s
subtle herby flavour is a
welcome surprise, and
it’s something of a shame
that it’s overwhelmed by
everything else.
If strong flavours are
your jam, though, you
may prefer the creative-
ly-named Samuel Hell
Jackson burger. There’s a
lot going on in here, not
least the punchy jalapeno
peppers – this one’s not
for korma fans. That being
said, there’s plenty to
enjoy if you’re a certified
spice aficionado, and the
pricing is still reasonable
at £9.
And so to our side
of choice: dirty fries,
complete with vegan aioli
and maple cured ‘bacon’
jam. The latter split the
authors – too sweet for
one of us, bang on for
the other. If you’re into
that whole sweet BBQ
sauce thing then you’ll
probably love it. We were
unanimous, though, in our
feelings towards the aioli:
this is the most impressive
part of the whole meal.
As non-vegans, we are
no strangers to the garlicy
mayonnaise and it is
indistinguishable from the
egg-based original.
The verdict? Vegan
junk food is just as good
as your meaty alternative
if done right. Stay tuned
for further instalments!
