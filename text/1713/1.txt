entitled to £30 gym

mperial students
who paid for gym
membership prior
to the 1st
September
2018 change in pricing
structure have been of-
fered a refund due to an
error on Sport Imperial’s
part.
Sport Imperial ac-
knowledged and apolo-
gised for the mistake in
an email sent out on 5th
October inviting all stu-
dents who were members
prior to September 2018
to claim their full refund.
Speaking to Felix, Will
Hollyer, Head of Sport
Imperial, said: “We’ve
made a mistake, we want
to hold our hands up and
apologise. We thought
we’d done the appropri-
ate due diligence. The
important thing from our
side is, we’ve identified it
and we’re taking steps to
remedy it.”
Students for which this
applies now face four
options:
1. Claim a full refund
of £30 – students will
continue to be able
to use the gym and
pool provided they
previously held a
membership.
2. Do not claim a refund
of £30 - this fee will
contribute towards
Sport Imperial’s
plans to develop and
improve opportu-
nities for sport and
physical activity at
the College.
3. Convert the £30 as
credit for another
Ethos service worth
£30 or more - e.g.
unlimited class pass,
Active Imperial
membership.
4. Donate the £30 credit
to the Sports Hub – a
jointly-run service
by Sport Imperial
and Imperial College
Union to support
and develop student
sports clubs. The
donations will go into
a general Sport De-
velopment fund that
all sports clubs will
be able to apply to.
The price increases,
which saw students asked
to pay an annual fee of
£30 for access to the gym
and pool at Ethos from
1st
September 2018, were
announced in June 2018,
as part of Sport Imperial
and Imperial College
Union’s joint Sports strat-
egy. However, following
complaints from students
and questions over the
legality of such increases,
it has since been found

that the change in pricing
structure violated the
previous terms and con-
ditions. For all members
that joined Sport Imperial
prior to September 2018,
the terms and conditions
stated that, following a
one-off payment of £40,
“gym and swim facilities
would be free of charge to
Imperial students for the
duration of their time at
the College”.
Concerns about the
change in pricing structure
were initially raised by a
student accusing Sport Im-
perial of fraud, as reported
by Felix in October 2018.
Following internal and
external counsel, Sport
Imperial were advised to
offer a full refund of the
£30 annual membership
to every student that had
signed up for membership
