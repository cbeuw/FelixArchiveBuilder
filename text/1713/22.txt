T
he weekend
started earlier for
some members of
Imperial Sailing,
as they left the lecture
theatres, packed up their
sailing bags and drove up
to Warwick on the Friday
night. The specially ap-
pointed driver (Toby) was
trusted with towing two
of the club’s boats that
Warwick Sailing Club
had borrowed, and which
would later use the mast
of one of them.
Whilst the group
partied all of Friday
night and socialised with
other uni sailors, the rest
of us were aiming to get
an non-optimal amount
of sleep before the 6am
drive on Saturday. In the
morning, the departure
was inevitably delayed
due to a late fresher,
Marta, who still doesn’t
know how to use an alarm
clock.
Still, the sun was
starting to come out and,
with plenty of sailing
freshers to spare, we
decided to let our sleepy
fresher make her own way
to Leamington Spa (the
closest train station she
could find to the sailing
club).
With a minibus packed
and another car filled to
the brim, we made a start
at 7am and managed to
have all of 25+ sailing
members in Draycote
Water for a 9.30am
briefing.
On arrival, the expected
strong winds, low tem-
peratures and snow were
thankfully not apparent
right away. Ignoring the
promise of stronger winds
throughout the day, the
boats were rigged with full
sails instead of cut-downs.
Our teams Imperial Blue,
White and Red launched
to start racing right away.
Shout out to Dan’s team
spirit (Third Team crew)
for immediately after fin-
ishing his race, jumping
into the car and picking
up his sleepy teammate
from the train station.
Apparently, driving with
sailing kit doesn’t affect
your driving skills.
The races started
slowly and in spite of
temperamental winds
and confusingly marked
locations, our teams were
“in spite of the
ever-changing
winds and
confusingly
marked
locations, our
teams were
getting on
well”
getting on well. As the
wind built up towards the
end of the morning, the
rain started and so did the
capsizes from our fourth
team – Imperial Kobra
Hurricane. The team
proved itself to be more
than nine social sailors, as
they attentively listened
to their coach – James
McLeod (Development
Officer) on how to become
unbeatable. However,
the advice did not prove
very useful, as one of the
freshers managed to sail
down the opposite end
of the lake and missed
the start of the race by 4
minutes, getting the club’s
first DNS (Did Not Start)
on a competition event.
The racing came to
an end by mid-afternoon
when sunlight was too
low to carry on sailing.
Our club was feeling
optimistic about our
performance. Overall
Imperial Blue and White
(first and second team)
were both tied in 1st with
100% wins, and Imperial
Red (third team) showed
good improvement during
the day, getting 2 wins in
total.
It was finally time to
get off the wet sailing kit
and dress up for the curry
social. As per tradition the
social at The Turtle, there
was copious amounts of
Eliminator prepared for
all the sailors. This is
the famously alcoholic
cocktail prepared by
Warwick students, the

recipe of which is closely
guarded. Upon hearing
the news that this year the
teams would be allocated
with a certain number
of bottles, our members
soon started to devise a
plan to get a hold of the
highest quantity of bottles
possible.
Eliminator really lived
up to its name, causing
some sailors´ memories of
the night to be foggier than
others, accounts of the
occurrences vary slightly.
All that is certain is that
all of the Imperial sailors
made it to the curry, and
most of us then went on to
Kelseys (a nearby club).
There, we procured more
Eliminator, played pool
and slowly split up into
groups to make our way
back to our host´s house.
The accommodation
provided seemed too
scarce for our 4 teams and
a half, leaving members
to get creative on how
to get a good nights of
sleep – we hear someone
managed to sleep in the
bed of one of the hosts,
and someone else booked
an Airbnb, conveniently
close to Kelseys.
Sunday morning came
too soon for many of us,
along with incredibly
strong winds. Because of
this, races were initially
postponed and, after Felix
tried to test sailing condi-
tions and almost capsized,
were ultimately cancelled.
This came as a welcome
announcement to the
many hungover sailors.
Boats were speedily
packed up and we all
bundled into our cars
and minibuses, happy to
finally be out of the wind.
Everyone arrived home
safely and, went straight
to bed.
Many thanks to Univer-
sity of Warwick Sailing
Club for organising the
event. Special thanks to
the designated club drivers
for getting everyone
(and our two fireflys) to
Warwick. Lastly, thanks
to Rooster Sailing for
providing us with sailing
kit during the year!
