Super Bowl LIII: GOAT defeats Rams
The events that took place on 03/02/2019 will not go down in history, well at least not for any good reasons…

F
ield general Tom
Brady marches
down the field
throwing short
bullets and long bombs.
Precise, calculated,
commanding and highly
efficient. Ain’t no mercy
for the weak.
This is the demi-god
quarterback of yesteryear
who overcame the largest
point deficit ever recorded
in Super Bowl history.
He cemented his place
in the hall of fame and
is the greatest of all time
(GOAT). Period. What’s
he doing now? This week
in the life of Brady he
polishes his super bowl
rings, washes his cat,
drops his kids at school
and wins the super bowl
for the sixth time…
Yes, Brady has
done it again. Brady is
now the proud owner of
his sixth Super Bowl ring,
which is the most by any
player. Ever. His legacy
and impact on football
is far-reaching and
those with no interest in
Football still know of the
legend quarterback Tom
Brady. This does come at
a cost, as he gets older he
is starting to trip on his
own legacy. Greatness is
expected and perfection
is assumed, and although
not always charismatic,
the novelty of winning the
Super Bowl is obviously
wearing thin. In the post-
game interview, he said:
“We’ve, uh, been this far
and lost, which is really
tough,” then added, “I
wish we’d played a little
better on offense, but
we won… Super Bowl
champs.” I can imagine
a half-hearted fist pump
with a “Woooooo!” after
that statement. Maybe this
speaks to his exhaustion
after the game, or his
overcritical-ness and
pursuit of perfection, but
for me it speaks to routine.
After 19 years of playing,
and -rightfully- being
given the title of GOAT,
perhaps the routine of
year-on-year NFL makes
the thought of retirement
more appealing. He has
nothing left to achieve,
and is just padding his
“Brady’s super
bowel creates
so much crap,
if you gave him
an enema he’d
only weigh
5lbs”
“They played
a 5 second
version which
was rudely
interrupted by
rapper Travis
Scott’s comet”
CV, adamant to play till
45 years old.
The yearly routine also
comes with the klassik
portrayal of the Patriots
as underdogs. “Everyone
thinks we suck, and you
know, can’t win any
games. … So, we’ll see,
it will be fun,” Brady told
CBS after the Patriots’
divisional-round win over
the Chargers. Fam, you
are part of the longest
dynasty in Football
history. Brady’s super
bowel creates so much
crap, if you gave him an
enema he’d only weigh
5lbs. Okay, that was
excessive, but there does
seem to be a Patriot fran-
chise conspiracy to paint
themselves as underdogs.
With Bill Belichick at the
helm, Patriots have won
six Super Bowls and have
been 1st in their division
sixteen times since he
took the position of head
coach in 2000. They are a
dynasty, with an ethos that
can be aptly summarized
by Belichick’s words after
they won Super Bowl LI:
“As of today, and as great
as today feels and as great
as today is, in all honesty
we’re five weeks behind
in the 2017 season.” This
inexhaustible work ethic
is what gives the Patriots a
winning season year after
year.
The franchise is able
to create pro-bowl level
athletes from those over-
looked, including Brady
and Edelman, who were
sixth and seventh round
draft picks respectively.
Edelman was the Super
Bowl LIII Most Valuable
Player, although original-
ly playing quarterback at
college he transitioned to
wide receiver and punt
returner for the NFL,
and was overlooked by
many teams. The Patriots
recognize tenacity and
ambition, and channel it
to develop these players
into superstars. It isn’t just
chance.
With all that in mind,
this Super Bowl has been
the most boring. It is just
bleurgh. Patriots win,
bleurgh. Most consec-
utive drives ending with
a punt in Super Bowl
history (Rams), bleurgh.
Fewest points scored by
the winning team in Super
Bowl history, bleurgh. It
was a punt-a-thon (making
the title of this piece a bit
misleading, sorrry!) There
were NO touchdowns in
the first three quarters,
and there were the fewest
touchdowns and fewest
points scored in Super
Bowl history. Just gross. I
don’t even want to analyze
player contribution or dive
into anaylsis about the
Rams (who I have failed
to mention thus far), this
is because the game will
be forgotten.
There was one way
they could have made it
memorable, one way they
could have inducted it into
public consciousness as a
day of awe and spectacle,
one way they could have
scribed it into annals of
time. That would have
been with SpongeBob.
A few months ago the
creator of SpongeBob
SquarePants, Stephen
Hillenburg, died. This
prompted a petition to
have “Sweet Victory” a
song from the show to be
played at Super Bowl LIII
half time show. Over a
million people signed the
petition and the stadium’s
social media accounts also
hinted that they’d play the
song, and they did! Well…
Sort of. They played a
5 second version which
was rudely interrupted
by rapper Travis Scott’s
comet, with which he
appeared on the stage…
This has caused mass
hysteria on the internet.
Leading to SpongeBob
fans and sympathizers
disliking NFL’s YouTube
videos so much they had
to re-upload them. Ah the
internet.
Tl;dr: Patriots win,
Brady is the GOAT, and
the internet likes Sponge-
Bob.
