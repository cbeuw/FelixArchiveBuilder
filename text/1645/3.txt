Consent training row at Imperial
RCSU president questions funding of Consent Matters software
Lef Apostolakis
T
he RCSU president,
Lloyd James, has
stepped forward to
question Imperial
College’s latest
investment in
student welfare, namely the
licence purchase of an online
consent training course, which
was financed by College and
cost a total of £ 5,000.
The challenge was first made
at the first council meeting of
this academic year, which
took place last week and saw
sabbatical officers presenting
their reports. During the
presentation of the Deputy
President’s report by Emily
Jane Cramphorn, James
brought up the consent training
course, suggesting that the
funds spent on the licensing
could have been spent better
elsewhere. Cramphorn
defended the program by
saying that the funding, having
come directly from College
and not the Union, meant that
the consent training would not
drain resources from Clubs
and Societies.
However this doesn’t seem
to have appeased James. In
a comment piece submitted to
felix, about the importance of
Council for holding staff and
sabs to account, he illustrates

his point with “a particularly
wasteful Union expenditure as
an example”, referring to the
consent training program.
In his comment piece,
James says that the concept
of consent is sufficiently
explained through the
infamous ‘Tea and Consent’
animation which was released
by the British Police in 2015. He
writes that “anyone who thinks
that potential rapists exist on
utterly wasted”.
Additionally, the RCSU
General Committee voted
unanimously to condemn
the expenditure. The specific
wording of the motion passed
was as follows. “The Royal
College of Science Union
condemns the spending
by College on the Consent
Matters software which we
believe to be a wasteful and
ineffectivemethodofinforming
students on the important issue
of consent.”
In reply to James’ piece,
Cramphorn (whose manifesto
points included delivering
consent workshops),
commented that “cases such
as Stanford, Columbia and
others across UK universities
have highlighted that the
sector is not equipped to
support students who are
victims of sexual violence.
Unfortunately the UK's Sex &
Relationship Education (SRE)
does not encompass consent,
and this means that there
are many young people who
may not understand what
behaviour is acceptable and
what behaviour isn't and what
makes a healthy approach to
relationships.”
Cramphorn indeed has a
point. A recent government
requested report published
earlier this October by
Universities UK shows that
sexual harassment on campus
is a major issue, which the
education sector is not
sufficiently tackling.
Spokesperson for The 1752
Group Dr Anna Bull said
that “despite the increasing
pressure on universities to
curb a rise in on-campus
assaults and improve their
safeguarding policies, young
women are nevertheless
often terrified about the
consequences if they make a
complaint, particularly about
a staff member. So often when
they do, the university’s chief
concern is to downplay any
wrongdoing and protect its
own reputation by keeping the
whole thing quiet.
More needs to be done
to protect women at British
universities. They need to be
encouraged to report assault
and harassment. In the US,
universities are obligated to
investigate any such claims
under federal law, regardless
of any criminal investigation.”
Cramphorn adds that “as an
institution and as a Students'
Union we have a duty of care
towards our students, to both
create a healthy, respectful
community, and to ensure that
we are able to support students
who have experienced sexual
violence. Currently the idea
of Consent Training is still
in review and evaluation
processes and hasn't yet been
rolled out to the student body,
but it is one of the steps we
and the college are taking
to produce an institutional
response towards tackling
sexual violence on campus”
Since the start of the
academic year, there have
been two sexual harassment
testimonials published in felix
by female students, who chose
to remain anonymous.

campus simply because they
were never presented with
a cartoon telling them that
‘you shouldn’t have sex with
unconscious people’ is utterly
delusional.” He concludes that
“this purchase will contribute
nothing to the student
experience on campus,” and
