Nine years later not much
has changed, but I have
noticed one big difference,
the location. In Sims 1 the one
place you could WooHoo on
was a ‘Vibromatic Heart Bed’
and if you didn’t have one
of them, you were screwed
(Or, more to the point,
unscrewed). They changed
this in the later iterations but
you’re still restricted to beds.

industry.
I remember rushing home
from school just so I could
sink hours of my own life into
directing the lives of others.
But why? Surely our lives
are just as interesting and
interactive? Why were so
many people attracted to this
world?
Social Life. First let’s look
at social lives. You won’t get
along with everyone in the
world. There will always be
people who don’t find your
jokes funny, who find you too
eccentric or boring, or who
just plain don’t like you. The
same is true in The Sims; no
matter how much you com-
pliment nor how many stories
you tell, you’re guaranteed to
have characters who will just
keep on insulting and fighting
you. The solution in this case
is simple, put one in a pool
and delete the ladder; now
wait a few days until the grim
reaper arrives. Sadly we can’t
do this in real life (They’d
probably figure how to climb
out for starters), so instead
we must settle for exchanging
unsentimental pleasantries
and stunted small talk. I know
which world I prefer.
WooHoo was definitely
one of the reasons I got into
the game. Being a twelve
year old boy, my first dose of
testosterone had just hit the
blood stream when Sims 2
was released. At this point, a
new topic clouded my mind,
sex, or in simlish ‘WooHoo’,
and The Sims was a good
starter point for my research.
Sadly in both worlds I came
to the same conclusion;
WooHoo was very hard to

the possibilities are endless.
This is less of a reason to play
The Sims and more of a thank
you to Maxis for keeping it
classy.
Aspirations. Sims definitely
have it easier here. When
was the last time you opened
the news paper, with a new
job in your dream sector,
only to shut it half an hour
later because you have no
experience and won’t even
get an interview? We all
know that achieving your
goals in life can be a long
and laborious task. Take,
for instance, the fact that
the biggest reason most
of us are at university for
three years plus is so we
can get our foot in the door
in a particular profession.
Juxtapose this with the Sims
and they haven’t even heard
of university (Unless you buy
the expansion pack but even
then it doesn’t affect your
working life, it’s just a way
to up your WooHoo count -
which is the second biggest
reason people go to uni).
The Sims provides a way to
succeed in life with ease and
in record timing. Ever thought
of writing a best selling novel?
Well now you can in a matter

Sims ain’t all about that WooHoo
glory, weirdly feeling a real
sensation of satisfaction and
accomplishment, and no
matter how vicarious it is, boy
it feels good.
Overall, whether it be to
elaborately kill a classmate
you dislike, or become a
rocket scientist, or explore
new avenues of life, there are
many reason why you could
easily get sucked into The
Sims. It’s a sandbox of reality
where you can simulate
endless stories and social
situations, without any sense
of embarrassment or fear of
failure. Or maybe I’m looking
too much into it and people
like it for the fact that it’s a
damn good game.
