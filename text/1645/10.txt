Choice Award, where people
can vote online for one of
the 25 images of the selected
shortlist if you want to get
involved in judging some of
the images yourself. Person-
ally I’m rooting for an image
of a kingfisher diving into the
water entitled The Blue Trail.
Coming out of this visual
journey, it’s difficult not to
urge everyone to check out
the WPY exhibition sometime
over the next year. It’s easy,
what with it being so close to
campus, to take the Natural
History Museum for granted,
but the exhibition is a great
reminder of how success-
ful the NHM is at instilling
a sense of wonder into its
visitors. While it’s true that
most of the winning images
are available to view online,
the experience of seeing them
displayed in a room devoid of
distractions is really unique.
With the rest of the South
Kensington area being so
loud in the holiday season,
spending a couple hours of
your day focused on these
images is a welcome break.
The exhibition tickets range
from £6.50-£8 with the
student concession and as
a bonus you get to skip the
long entry queues than can
overwhelm Exhibition Road
this time of year. So please
take an hour out of your
schedule to have a wander
and a wonder.
T
ucked away in
a quiet corner
of the Natural
History Museum,
The Wildlife
Photographer of
the Year (WPY) exhibition
provides a welcome respite
from the maddening crowds
that flood the museum during
the holiday season. The
atmosphere changes as soon
as you walk into the darkened
room filled with birdsong,
and you are presented
with a series of illuminated
photographs all equally
stunning and interesting in
their own right.
Now in its 52nd
year, it’s
a joy to report that the
exhibition is still a beautiful
and sprawling representation
of both the natural world
and the skill of these elite
photographers. The gallery
is sectioned into the different
categories of the competition
and further sub sectioned
according to either animal
group, or global habitat. The
well-lit, large photographs
are aligned consecutively
around the room, allowing
contemplative observation as
you make your way through
the exhibition. Each image
rightly takes its place as a
finalist by acting as a glorious
representation of the natural
world. Helpfully there is also
an extensive caption beneath
each image, describing how
the photo was taken from
a technical standpoint, but
also providing context about
the animal and environment
depicted in the image. There’s
a broad range of subjects and
environments on display, with
photos from suburban London
to the coastline of Cape Town,
not only showing visitors
the extraordinary but also
making the everyday appear
extraordinarily beautiful.
Despite the wealth of talent
displayed here, interestingly
some of the winning images
may seem inferior to other
finalists. It quickly becomes
clear that the panel rewards
photographers for technical
skill and an interesting sub-
ject, in addition to the vivid
colouration and composition
of the photo. Since pho-
tographers all have access
to outstanding equipment to
help capture the best shots,
a wildlife photo often only
stands out when the subject is
exhibiting unusual behaviour,
or the image really captures
the qualities of the habitat in
shot. Examples of this include
an image entitled Eviction
Attempt which shows the
bizarre scenario of a para-
keet on the wing attempting
to haul a monitor lizard out
of the bird’s nest, by its tail.
The amphibians, reptiles and
fish category truly epitomised
how the photos were judged,
with the winning photo of
a terrapin in the gloom of
a pond, seeming dull and
uninteresting to the neutral
eye, when compared to some
of the other finalists. However,
the technical skill involved in
reflecting the dark nature of
the pond whilst still achieving
clarity of subject is outstand-
ing, and it naturally hasn’t
gone unnoticed by the judges.
This is further reflected
in a shot called Alley Cat,
picturing a leopard skulking
through the side streets of
Mumbai. Usually in such a
dark environment, the require-
ment is a wide aperture,
slow shutter and high ISO
to allow in maximum light,
yet the photographer used
a low flash to illuminate the
subject with great clarity,
while preserving the gloom of
the alleyway. This artistic skill
is apparent throughout the
exhibition, with shutter speed
adjustment, aperture setting,
and flash control, all contrib-
uting to a wealth of shots that
appear more painting than
photograph, and present the
natural world in an almost
otherworldly light. In a world
of social media, where every
photo taken is highly edited
and filtered, the beauty of
these unedited images is even
more impressive.
It seems odd then that
with all this equipment and
technical ability presented by
the photographers, that the
winning shot was taken with a
goPro camera, displayed high
in a fig tree, and controlled
remotely. Winner Tim Lanam,
who has won the contest
before, presents an orang-
utan struggling up the tree
in search of fruit, high above
the canopy. It’s a fantastically
clever shot, reflecting the
effort invested by the animal,
whilst also providing a
window into the world of a
now severely endangered
great ape, whose habitat dis-
played in the photograph is
severely under threat. It also
follows a growing trend in the
major award winners across
all categories, with images
depicting animals struggling
against urbanisation, pollu-
tion and habitat destruction
being the most successful
awards-wise. For example
the winner of the Wildlife
Photojournalist Award: Single
Image is a deeply harrowing
picture of dead pangolins, the
word’s most trafficked animal
for medicine and luxury food.
One the strongest aspects of
the exhibition is the acknowl-
edgement of how humans
have impacted the lives of
these beautiful creatures.
A section in the centre of
the room is dedicated to the
Young Wildlife Photographer
of the Year contest with an
array of photos taken by
amateurs aged 11-17. These
photos, while generally not
as serious in subject matter
as some of the others, are not
any less breathtaking. The
grand title winner The Moon
and the crow is one of the
most stunning photos in the
exhibition and it’s a struggle
to believe that someone
under ten one of the winning
images of a chiffchaff. As well
as the central and junior con-
tests there is also the People’s
Wildlife photographer of the year 2016
Madeleine Webb and George Brooks pair up to discuss the science and technical skill behind
the 52 yearold exhibition and of course, what it takes to bag that coveted a first prize.
