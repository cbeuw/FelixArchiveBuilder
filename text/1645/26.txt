Keeping our guard up!
Jamie Simpson
Odgers came 15th
and Harry
Peck earned himself a bronze
medal.
This surely signals the start
of great things for IC Fencing.
B
oth the men’s and
women’s 2nd
s started
their season in the
best possible way,
albeit in different
circumstances. The
women’s 2nd
s started their
league off against Royal
Holloway, kicking off with
épée. The team was off to
a flying start with the final
score 45-42 to Imperial.
Next up was sabre. Despite
a severe lack of experience
and by a stroke of brilliance
the team did markedly better
in sabre than they had in
épée, finishing 45-39. Royal
Holloway learnt the hard way
that the best way to trigger
aggression in a sabreur is
to make then believe their
opponent has stolen all their
food. Foil was a little shakier,
going into the final bout
19-40. The final fencer was
Ginevra; an épéeist at heart
but after this performance she
may want to reconsider! Point
after point, parry after parry
Ginevra scored, clawing
Imperial’s score up to 38 and
doubling the team’s effort
up to that stage. Imperial
supporters cheered on
Ginevra as she exceeded all
expectations and delivered
the most spectacular
comeback seen by the team
in living memory. Despite
losing foil, the women’s 2nd
s
won the match overall, with
an accumulative score of 128-
126, starting off the year with
a win.
The men’s 2nd
s, already
riding high off their first win
of the year (also against
Royal Holloway), were
fencing Portsmouth. The men
wasted no time in the first
weapon, foil, where they
won comfortably with a
score of 45-26. Next up was
sabre where the score ended
45-17 to Imperial, meaning
we could have scored no
points in epee and still won
the match. Luckily epee kept
up this streak winning 45-
29, giving an overall score
of 135-73, meaning the
men’s 2nd
s matches have all
been won on average by an
impressive margin of over
50! Finally, over the weekend
three Imperial fencers
competed in the prestigious
Elite Épée. Out of 83, Jamie
Simpson finished 24th

IC Cross Country: record turnout at first race
O
n a
remarkably
dry October
day. the
shouts of
“ICXC we so
sexy!” lit up the first race of
the London Colleges League
(LCL) last Wednesday at
Parliament Hill. With their
shiny new red & blue vests,
the newest members of the
club were ready to represent
against the masses of UCL,
Kings, Brunel and St. Mary’s,
to name but a few.
An impressive turnout made
this an atmospheric race with
150 in the men’s race and
103 in the women’s. Imperial
also had a record number of
participants with 48 lining up.
The start was slightly manic as
usual, with spectators won-
dering whether Club Captain
Jones had got a head start as
he sped up the looming hill to
take some photos.
Johnson led the women
coming in an excellent
9th
after a gruelling half
marathon the weekend
before. New recruits Van
Zelst and Olding both had
excellent debut races, coming
13th
and 16th
respectively.
Despite complaining about
not racing until halfway
round, Women’s Captain
Mundell came in 23rd
, placing
Imperial 3rd
overall out of 22
participating teams. Strong
finishes from Imperial 2s
placed them in 10th, with a
special mention for debutant
Sofia Bettanin who finished
51st.
In the men’s race Selley led
out a solid first lap to gain 5th
for his first race in an Imperial
vest, followed by Allison
in 7th. Scriven, Johnson,
Jones and Garcia all worked
impeccably to finish 25th
, 41st
,
44th
and 45th
respectively. This
places the Imperial Men’s 1st
team in a strong 4th
out of 29.
Circuits specialist Jackson
powered through to 49th
for the men’s 2nd
s, followed
by Knight coming in 60th
(who had already cycled to
the race beforehand). Core
coach Jones crunched his
way to an excellent 68th,
with fresher Collyer putting
in an excellent first display
to finish 72nd
. Tomkies and
Munoz Heinen finished strong
to place the 2s in 11th
in the
standings. The men’s 3rd
and
4th
teams finished 15th
and 19th
overall.
The club was impressed
with all new-comers, from vet-
erans of the mud and cold to
those who have never taken
part in a race before. Commit-
tee members commented that
this was the strongest Imperial
team they had seen in years.
Once again ICXCAC would
like to congratulate all those
who raced and look forward
to seeing more new faces at
the next LCL on Wednesday
the 2nd
of November at Mit-
cham Common.

A
fter last
Saturday’s
devastatingly
close defeat
to Brunel in
a friendly,
Imperial was on a mission
to right this wrong and be
deemed victorious on the
pitch. They marched out with
determination – the likes of
which has not been seen since
we put a man on the moon –
with two subs to cheer them
on. Alas, this would prove
insufficient.
Imperial battled valiantly,
with back Anna claiming a
try, but there was no stopping
Brunel’s onslaught. As the
game wore on the ball went
back and forth so much you
would’ve thought it was a
Brexit campaigner. Imperial
gave way to three tries from
the Brunel side, but scored
another two itself. Football
experienced Anna would go
on to be awarded ‘back of
the match’ for converting two
of Imperials three tries, one
from a near impossible angle.
Now 2/3 is a respecta-
ble conversion rate, but if
Imperial can do one thing, it’s
basic mathematics, and tragi-
cally 3/3 is greater than 2/3.
Brunel converted all three of
its opportunities and went on
to win 21-19.
While an upsetting result,
this game was not without
its merits. The Imperial team
have already showed a
great improvement since the
beginning of the season,
there was quick and effective
rucking with strong footholds
and powerful drivings of the
ball up the pitch. Shout-out to
forward of the match Laura.
All in all, it has been a
great start to the season for
Imperial Women’s Rugby, it is
only unfortunate that this loss
by the slimmest of margins
will constitute the same points
as one lost by hundreds.

your interest, Imperial Wom-
en’s Rugby is hosting a taster

Netball 1s secure first victories of the season
Madeleine Webb
Charlotte to maintain the lead
through some great shooting
– remaining calm under
mounting pressure. The player
of the match unsurprisingly
was the GK captain Kath,
who pushed for every
turnover with an impressively
high success rate, especially
in the second half of the
match. 43-36 final score.
T
he first team had
to wait 3 games to
taste victory, but it
was definitely worth
it. Pre-ACC matches
always have an
extra sense of excitement but
the home game at Heston
against St Mary’s was the
1s first cup game and had a
great atmosphere before the
match even started. In the
first quarter the game stayed
tight at 11-6, with a relatively
new team not used to playing
together. Impressive defensive
displays from Kath, Filippa
and Annie in the second
quarter ensured St Mary’s
only scored two goals in the
second quarter.
The game got progressively
louder as the collective
confidence of the team grew.
The attacking side, bolstered
by new members in both
the mid court and shooting
sections, capitalised on this
by gaining a substantial
advantage in goal difference
thanks to some great
shooting. The third quarter
tightened the score slightly
with stamina always being
an issue at the start of the
season. Luckily (or unluckily
depending on your outlook)
the clubs’ new coaches
have increased the focus on
fitness in training, with the
team recovering their form in
the final quarter, stretching
out their lead and breaking
the 50-goal target set at
half time. Everyone played
well but St Mary’s selected
GS/GA Maddie as player
of the match. Overall, the
performance exhibits good
teamwork within the 1s and
bodes well for the future.
Final score 53-21. Post match

Monday’s match, the first
to be hosted at Ethos, was
a much tougher affair both
physically and mentally.
Opposition team Royal
Holloway are always a
challenge so the team did
well not to be intimidated by
what became a loud match.
Our psychological game
was greatly improved by
the presence of our coach
Yasmin. The first quarter
featured a strong attack
and Imperial built up a
commanding lead. However,
the rest of the match was
very much a defensive game,
with all players working
on keeping up intensity
and staying close to the
opposition. Again, the pace
of the match started to take
its toll, with fitness stopping
some of the more ambitious
plays but everyone did well
to dig deep and continue
fighting. The work of both
the defensive and mid court
players allowed shooter
