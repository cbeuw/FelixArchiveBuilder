the release of songs each
built on its own unique sound
and set of lyrics. All are very
easy (sometimes annoyingly
so) to sing along to and stick
in your head. Shows like this
are a testament to their ability
to not only produce great
music, but to show it off with
great musicianship and style.

foliage along the stage.
The show finishes with an
absolutely deserved encore,
as the front-man storms down
the middle of the screaming
crowd before the band plays
their own take on Kanye
West’s hit song Love Lock-
down. They follow this with
Pork Soda, which unexpect-
edly involves the throwing
of a pineapple from stage to
crowd.
Glass Animals are massive
and for a very good reason:
E
ntering the venue,
the mood of the
night to come
seemed to emanate
throughout. Huge
Tetris shaped lights
hang high above the stage,
glowing a bright orange/
yellow light across the
growing audience. After a
short entrance, the band
wastes no time before
jumping into their first song,
Life Itself – a catchy, drum-
heavy song that entices you
to dance along. The front-
man, Dave Bayley, starts
leaping around the stage
while sending his voice flying
across the venue in almost
flawless tone and clarity.
Having grabbed the atten-
tion of the crowd and set the
energetic mood of the show,
the band quickly plunges
into more great songs from
both their albums, including
Season 2 Episode 3 – giving
off an odd romantic ballad
vibe to the crowd - Gooey,
Youth, and Black Mambo to
name a few. The set list allows
for no dull moments or times
of rest from the onslaught
of catchy lyrics, mindless
dance-inducing beats and
sounds, and vibrant visuals
emanating from the Tetris
block lights and lit up desert
A
very bad
presentiment
seized us when
we stepped
into Grande
halle de la
Villette : one pint of Heineken
cost seven euros and it
seemed like Heineken was the
only sponsor of the event. We
went to see Flavien Berger, a
French musician that neither
of us had listened to before,
but he somehow became the
surprise of the day. His deep
raspy voice melded with the
funky beats and spaced out
synths in an eccentric yet
coherent way. As my friend
Alicia, who just moved to
Paris, got excited about the
successful exploration of
French music, we gradually
forgot about booze issues
and became confident that
the level of soberness would
not affect the experience at
all.
Instead of just ‘pressing play
on the stage’ as Alicia put
it, the collaboration of Todd
Terje and the Olsens per-
formed excellent disco covers
of some classical electronic
pieces including Firecracker
from Japanese electronic trio
YMO. In the end, it was the
disco version of Inspector
Norse that finally got the
crowd going. The day finished
with Moderat. The mind-blow-
ing stage effects made it the
best performance of the day,
but that’s what you’d expect
from Moderat.
On day twoI was looking
forward to M.I.A, my
celebrity crush, but her
performance was surprisingly
underwhelming. Instead of
singing, she just talked to the
crowd for most of the set.
There was no bass at all and
her sound was too weak to
be heard sometimes. As we
all got very disappointed
we thought that the day was
pretty much doomed, but
the electronic session after
midnight saved everything.
It started with the symbolic
quirky melodies from Acid
Arabic, followed by a twist of
hard techno and disco from
Motor City Drum Ensemble.
The vibe was then refreshed
by Daphni, the side project
from Caribou. The epitome of
the rebellion against predict-
able mainstream EDM, it was
the best music to dance to
when sober and surrounded
by those who aren’t.
For the first day everyone
was well-behaved. Alicia said
that it was a Paris thing; Paris-
ians don’t need drugs and
alcohol to enjoy themselves.
And then there we were on
day two, stood in the middle
of the crowd watching people
around us getting high and
losing themselves.
‘We are in England again.’
Alicia turned around and said
to me.
People aren’t that different
after all.

This down to earth outfit talks Glastonbury, being Kylie
super-fans, and what’s next after a huge 2016.

\\ “If people said
Formation were a
country-funk band,

really’” \\
the place is massive. It takes
like 45 minutes to get across,”
sighs Will.
“It takes 45 minutes without
gear!” Kai chimes in. “The
whole place was flooded, it
was like a river.”
They didn’t let this dampen
their spirits.
“When you see it on TV
it’s all sunny and everyone’s
all high and stuff. This year
people were falling all over
the place, but everyone was
cool and helping each other
out,” explains Will.
Claiming influences from
A Tribe Called Quest to Pink
f
elix catches up with
Formation while they’re
on tour with Jagwar
Ma. Another notch on
their belt after playing
Glastonbury, Field
Day and having their song
Pleasure chosen for the FIFA
17 soundtrack. In the room
are front-man Will Ritson, his
twin brother Matt (synths),
Jonny Tams (bass) and Kai
Akinde-Hummel (drums).
They heard the FIFA news
from their manager while at
Glastonbury, but this isn’t the
only benefit of their recent
successes.
“There’s some things we’ve
always wanted to do,”
explains Kai, “like get some
free shoes.”
“That’s a big one!” jokes
Jonny. “We may as well give
up now!”
Surprisingly this hasn’t yet
lead to a bump in their follow-
ing, but something else did.
“We noticed a big spike
after Beyoncé released a
song called Formation,”
“People were like: this ain’t
Beyoncé!” Laughs Kai.
“I still think if you put us in
Google you wont find us,”
guesses Will.
Humour and humility go
hand in hand with Forma-
tion, but this can’t be said for
everyone.
“You get backstage and
some people are so big it’s
like they’re not even a human
being,” laments Will.
Perhaps their identity stems
from the closeness of the
band. Will and Matt are twins
and have been writing music
together since 2013. Working
with family would be unthink-
able to some, but this band
thrives on it.
“We don’t really know any
different,” starts Matt.
“We all share musical
interests and like working
together. So Matt and Jonny
both play bass, me and Kai
play drums, and Sash does
synths. We all do different
bits and whoever comes up
with the best plays it,” contin-
ues Will.
But what do Kai and Jonny
think of the arrangement?
“Let’s talk when they’re not
around,” laughs Kai. “It’s
good, we’re always working
towards something. Will’s a
drummer too, so I always get
a second opinion.”
Sash usually plays synths,
but the band are one man
down for this tour. This isn’t
the only challenge facing a
band new on the scene.
“We had to carry our own
gear [at Glastonbury] and
Floyd, they’re wary about
labelling themselves with a
genre.
“People like to put things
into a certain box. I think it
makes people uncomfortable
if they can’t make compari-
sons,” suggests Kai.
“If people said Formation
were a country-funk band,
we’d be like ‘not really’,”
laughs Matt.
“Send us a link to that
band!” Jonny jokes.
“If you were going to call
it anything, it’s pop music,”
finishes Matt.
Speaking of Pop, the band
recall meeting Kylie Minogue
at their record label’s Christ-
mas Party.
“Kylie was so nice. Genu-
inely like really nice. She’s
legit,” comments Matt.
“Last Summer we played
at a pub in the middle of
Somerset with Kylie Minogue
and Duran Duran. The article
afterwards with the photo of
Matt next to Kylie was like
‘Kylie Super Fans’,” laughs
Kai
Recording with house
producer Leon Vynehall and
Ben Baptie this year, they
hope to see their debut album
released early next year.
Big things lay in store for this
group, but felix doesn’t think
it’ll change them.
“We don’t want to get lost
in the fame. We don’t want
to feel like we can’t talk to
someone. We just want to be
the same. You never want to
lose who you are.”
