Pre-Apocalypse
L
ast week we freed the nipple and it was great.
The reaction was better than we thought we
could have hoped for. There wasn’t one. No
one complained, we received no angry letters,
phone calls or emails. No one cared. Which
proves our point. Nipples aren’t a big deal and
though we still have a lot of work to do towards gender
equality, maybe, just maybe we’re slowly getting there.
Ironically, this week, it seems there’s a heated
conversation going on regarding consent training
because Imperial has spent £5,000 on licensing an
online consent training course. But while there are those
who view it as a gross misallocation of resources, I’m
sure victims of sexual abuse will disagree. Especially
considering we’ve had two testimonials of sexual abuse
in the paper this year already.
The conversation on gender equality is constantly
expanding. Who knows – maybe next week we’ll have
another female world leader? Or maybe the next US
President will resemble an overcooked baked bean
with a Pomeranian glued on its head. We’ll know for
sure after Tuesday (probably).
For now, we’ve tried to provide some content that
might clue you in on the US presidential election
race. Admittedly there’s not much, because the whole
shebang is a mind-boggling travesty and with 2016
already being the turd that it is, we just didn’t want to
push anyone over the edge.
Besides, what with the high court coming out today
saying Theresa May will have to ask parliament before
activating article 50, if we’re really lucky, we’ll have
our own travesty of a general election to worry about.
Wooh!
But let’s not dwell on that. For now, let’s focus on the
US, so read on and don’t forget to tune in next week
for the aftermath.
