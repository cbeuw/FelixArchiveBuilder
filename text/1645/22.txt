Italian for Brunch
felix rolls out pasta with a Michelin
star chef, and investigates the finest
that Theo’s Simple Italian has to offer
– none of it simple, but all widely
Italian and full of fantastic flavours,
with ravioli, tiramisu and more
vegetables. The pork t-bone
was another of my favour-
ites, with slices of succulent,
juicy pork on top of perfectly
cooked rainbow chard and
Portobello mushrooms,
saturated with the wonderful
juices from the pork and the
drizzling of gravy.
Dessert, or should I say
dolci, is the course all ladies
look forward to in a meal,
and this was no exception
despite our near-exploding
stomachs by the end of the
secondi. It was an attractive
platter of tiramisu, a baked
I
t’s not every day you
meet a Michelin-star
chef. Not hysterically
screaming after catching
a glimpse some 50-metres
away, but to be within
talking distance, and most
importantly, taking a selfie.
All thanks to the cohort of
lovely PRs, one such event
filled up the Saturday after-
noon rectangle in my black
Moleskine diary last week,
much to the envy of my peers.
The unfinished problem sheets
got pushed to the bottomless
black hole in the back of
my mind, and off I went to a
pasta making master-class
at Theo’s Simple Italian, a
new restaurant tucked on the
ground floor of Hotel Indigo,
a stone’s throw from Earl’s
Court tube station.
Theo Randall was a
well-respected head chef at
The River Café for over 15
years, earning a Michelin
star for the restaurant, then
leaving to launch his own
restaurant, Theo Randall at
the Intercontinental in 2006.
Theo now also serves as the
Culinary Director at Theo’s
Simple Italian. The restaurant
also commits to inspire diners
to recreate the simple Italian
food at home, featuring an
Italian deli selling seasonal
produce, fine ingredients and
artisan products.
Where was I? Yes, crossing
the road in my stiff navy
duffle coat, and up the steps
into the classy yet relaxed
atmosphere, adorned by
marble tables, leather chairs
and warm ceiling lights. I
entered the spacious private
room, and was greeted by a
few familiar blogger faces, a
glass of prosecco and Theo
Randall himself, chatting
cheerily in the corner.
The master class started
soon after the introduction.
We were led to a cosy area
tucked in the back of the
room. A wooden table stood
on one side, with a few ingre-
dients plus a shiny table top
pasta machine clamped firmly
on top. Theo unwrapped the
bright yellow pasta dough
he had prepared before-
hand while telling us stories
of his experiences in Italy,
how ricotta is made and
his special pasta recipe. He
sat ourselves along the long
tables, ready to be served
the new four-course brunch
menu. An antipasti platter,
starring 4 types of cured
meats from Naples, Piedmont,
and Florence, and a glossy
globe of Apulian burrata on
a bed of rocket and roasted
cherry tomatoes was shared
amongst four along with some
soft rosemary and sea salt
focaccia. The 3 pasta dishes
for primi aroused excitement
across the tables as we saw
the fresh pasta made during
the demonstration served
before us. The ravioli, filled
with a creamy light ricotta
and rainbow chard, was
cooked and tossed in a simple
sage butter. The wide ribbons
of papparadelle came coated
with a full-bodied beef ragout
and was quickly distributed
around the table. The third,
was the Taglierini Pascatore –
generous portions of mussels,
clams, prawns and fish in
tomato sauce surrounded
the fine laces of pasta, which
soaked up the strong fishy
flavours from the seafood,
perhaps too strong for a few
on my table but was essential
to become my favourite dish
out of all three.
The secondi also featured 3
dishes. The Tagliata di Manzo
was a chargrilled bavette
of beef, served in slices that
reveal the beautiful, juicy,
pink, medium-rare meat with
a dressed hedge of peppery
rocket, borlotti beans and
roasted cherry tomatoes. The
fish dish starred a portion
of sea bream, with its skin
pan fried to a crispy golden
yellow, served with roasted
tomatoes and delicious
colourful strips of grilled

machine, folded and rolled

hand was constantly on the
handle, turning as quickly as
a turbine. The once clay-like

silk, which was swiftly cut
into a handful of thread-like
taglierini. The rest of the
dough was made into ravioli,
like soft cushions resting on
the green cutting board.
After a round of amazed
gasps and questions, we
ricotta cheesecake and soft
chocolate cake with a scoop
of vanilla gelato. The tiramisu
was amazing – a fellow
blogger even described it to
be better than her mother’s.
The cheesecake, baked rather
than fridge-set, was light and
mellow in flavour, pairing
well with the strips of pear on
top. The chocolate cake was
pure indulgence – rich, dense
and moist, almost like a fudge
cake.
This brunch menu was
truly satisfying for the taste
buds and the stomach. The
dishes, from antipasti all
the way through to dolci,
maintained the simplicity
and authentic flavours from
Italy, and brought out the
best from the top-quality
ingredients. Just fuss-free,
delicious food reflecting
Theo and his team’s expertise
and effort, supported by a
beautiful, chilled-out setting
and wonderful service. Highly
recommended.
