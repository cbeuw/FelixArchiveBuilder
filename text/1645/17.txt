aren’t cool;
outing
yourself as
a musical
fan to the
culture-savvy crowd is only
marginally better than saying
you consider the Christmas
panto to be the height of
creative output. Original
musicals that manage to
create some sort of cultural
impact are an even rarer
breed; the musicals that
dominate Broadway and the
West End have been running
for eons. Every year, a new
host of plays and albums push
the boundaries, but a new
Book of Mormon or Les Mis
doesn’t come around every
day.
There must be exceptions
to every rule; Hamilton has
created such a cultural impact
in the two short years since
its off-Broadway debut that
earlier this year it swept up a
whole host of Tonys, and won
a Pulitzer for writer Lin-Ma-
nuel Miranda. It’s a favourite
of the Obamas, countless
thinkpieces have been written
about it, standard tickets are
sold out in New York until
summer 2017, and the few
tickets that remain are selling
for upwards of $700. Why
has Hamilton taken the world
by storm? Is it worth the steep
prices?
Hamilton began its life as
the The Hamilton Mixtape, a
series of songs that set the life
of Alexander Hamilton, an
American founding father, to
a mix of R&B, rap, and show
tunes. It sounds like the lesson
General Washington’s ‘right
hand man’, and shape the US
constitution after the Revolu-
tionary War, in the process
becoming the first Secretary
of the Treasury. Miranda,
who was inspired by Ron
Chernow’s award winning
biography of Hamilton, saw
Hamilton’s life as “classic
hip-hop narrative”; the story
of a man born in poverty
who makes it to the top of the
social hierarchy through the
power of his words.
Hamilton’s plot unfolds over
46 songs, without any dia-
logue in between. The songs
are written with an easy
virtuosity, melding together
original text with allusions
to rap, and pop-culture
references. In One Last Time,

plan of a substitute Year nine
history teacher that has just
passed their PGCE, but from
the moment that Lin-Manuel
Miranda first rapped the
initial draft of Alexander
Hamilton, the first song of the
musical at the 2009 White
House Poetry Slam, it became
apparent that the concept
not only worked, but had
the potential to change the
cultural landscape.
Alexander Hamilton was
born out of wedlock in the
West Indies, to a white Carib-
bean mother, and a Scottish
father. His mother died whilst
he was young, and he was
abandoned by his father.
When a hurricane destroyed
his hometown, Hamilton, then
17, wrote a letter describ-
ing the devastation it had
wreaked. When the letter was
published in North America,
it brought aid relief to the
island, and gave Hamilton
the funds to go to New York
to study at King’s College
(now Columbia). There, he
would meet other revolution-
aries, eventually become
Washington steps down from
the presidency, one of the
final verses quotes verba-
tim Washington’s farewell
address. Hamilton begins
to speak the words, and
Washington joins in, singing
over Hamilton. The harmony
between melody and spoken
word is a reference to
will.i.am’s remix of Obama’s
2008 ‘Yes We Can’ speech,
in which the rapper sings
over a Obama delivering his
speech. In another instance,
in Helpless, a song in which
Eliza Schuyler meets and falls
in love with Hamilton, the
melody is lifted straight from
Beyoncé’s Countdown which
Miranda considers the “most

perfect song ever written.”
Indeed there are so many
allusions to other works; litera-
ture, history, and hip hop that
Miranda published a several
hundred page book detailing
the different references.
In tying history to the sound
of the present, Miranda joins
a long tradition of writers
throughout history who have
used references the audience
will understand as a cultural
shorthand to set the tone of
the work, and underscore
its message. When the cast
performed Hamilton at the
White House, President
Obama remarked that in
Hamilton “rap is the language
of revolution. Hip-hop is the
backbeat.”
Hamilton follows the birth
of the ‘American experiment’;
the revolution against the
oppressive English monarchy,
and the formation of a new
government. In the musical,
debates in the newly formed
cabinet are written as rap
battles; Washington, the
President acts as the MC, as
Hamilton and Jefferson trade
barbs over fiscal policy. In
another instance, Daveed
Diggs as the Marquis de
Lafayette raps with dizzying
speed as he enters into
the fray of battle
with the Brit-
ish forces
at
Yorktown.
Earlier this year, as Ham-
ilton rapped ‘this is not a
moment/it’s the movement’,
a slogan intertwined with the
Black Lives Matter move-
ment, outside the Richard
Rodgers, thousands were
marching in the streets of
New York in protest of the
lack of judicial action against
the police officers who killed
Eric Garner whilst he was in
police custody. In Hamilton,
Miranda ties the experience
of the founding fathers with
the experience of America’s
minorities today.
Throughout this
election cycle,
the far right in America have
railed against the ‘browning
of America’, the process
by which the demographic
in America is changing
to include more Hispanic
people, more African Ameri-
cans, more Asian Americans.
This small but very vocal
subset have bemoaned the
loss of an imagined past, in
which America was “great”,
Hamilton seeks to highlight
that America is what always
has been; a land of immi-
grants, “young, scrappy, and
hungry” to leave their mark.
This is a subject that Miranda,
himself a second genera-
tion immigrant, clearly feels
strongly about. The musical
recasts the white American
revolutionaries with minority
actors; George Washington
is played by a black man,
Chris Jackson, Daveed Diggs
is Thomas Jefferson (and
Marquis de Lafayette), Phil-
lipa Soo, an Asian American,
plays Eliza Hamilton; the
only white actor is Jonathan
Groff, playing George III, the
oppressor. The subtext could
hardly be more unsubtle,
or more revolutionary. In
casting minority actors in
the roles of the founding
fathers, Miranda has opened
up history to young minority
children in America who
have never seen themselves
reflected in the history books,
or have felt any claim to the
founding of their nation.
Hamilton is an ode to Amer-
ica, to its revolutionary spirit,
and its changing face. In one
of the most moving verses in
the musical, Hamilton sings
“America, you great unfin-
ished symphony, you sent for
me/You let me make a dif-
ference/A place where even
orphan immigrants/Can leave
their fingerprints and rise
up.” In Hamilton, America’s
heritage is celebrated, but the
founding fathers are not dei-
fied; when Jefferson attacks
Hamilton on creating wealth
simply by “moving money
around”, and claims “In Vir-
ginia/we plant seeds in
the ground/We
create,”
Hamilton, an abolitionist hits
back;“Yeah, keep ranting/We
know who’s really doing the
planting.” It is one of the few
references to the founding
fathers’ support of slavery
that survives in the finished
musical, but the fact that is
addressed at all is powerful.
America is a country built by
immigrants, by slaves, and
by people of all races and
colours whose stories have
been swept under the rug. It
is also a country days from
potentially voting in a xeno-
phobic demagogue into the
Presidency.
Hamilton the musical, its
writer, and its cast repre-
sents the best of America, its
ingenuity, inclusivity, ambition
and creativity. One of the
candidates in this presidential
election represents the worst.
We, as the rest of the world,
can do nothing but look and
hope that the electorate in
America take one of Hamil-
ton’s last words in the musical
to heart; “wise up.”
