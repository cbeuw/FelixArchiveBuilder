Kabaddi!Kabaddi!Kabaddi!

ight, now I’ve got
your attention,
listen up. I’m the
new Sport editor, I
love playing sports,
I love writing
about sports, and right now
I’m writing about one sport
most of you probably haven’t
heard of (including myself
until a week ago). Apologies
in advance for those
expecting a heroic sports
story, I’m more likely to star in
The Benchwarmers than The
Mighty Ducks.
Kabaddi is what I might
call a fusion sport. It brings
back memories of play-
ground games of tag whilst
maintaining the gentlemanly
manner of rugby. Two teams
of seven face off across a
have a host of achievements
including success in national
tournaments, the first ever
established Women’s Kabaddi
team, and being awarded
‘Sports Club of the Year’ in
2015/16 by Sport Imperial.
The drills were efficient and
informative. Everyone learns
the basics and confidence
grows as a result. We move
into some games: teams
picked with experienced
players as captains. I watch
as the first two teams face
off, beginners given constant
encouragement to get
involved. Now my turn. I take
the hand of the teammate
I’m coupled with (part of the
game I promise) and watch
as an opponent makes their
way across to us. Various
shuffled movements lead to a
snatched touch, an escapee
brought to the ground and
an overweight reporter
crossing the halfway line in
an attempt to help. I’m told
this is a foul, but I’m given
the benefit of the doubt. I’m
given a chance to raid with
little result, but I’m starting
to like this unusual foray of
what could be misconstrued
as violent form of kiss chase,
if they were to introduce
mixed teams. The flow of the
defence as it moves round

he 2s continued
their perfect streak
with yet another
win, this time at
Fortress Harlington
against Canterbury
Christ Church. With the 1s
on a rest week, the team
had a big, loud crowd to
back them up, and did not
disappoint. The Imperial
pack was unstoppable,
winning every scrum,
making it easy work for
power centre Giustinuainaiai
(spelling confirmation
pending) to smash through
the try line, topping it all off
with a celebratory “dab”.
After the stalemate was
broken, Imperial cruised
on through to an easy win,
with a very cheeky hat-
trick from fake fresher (but
real lobster) Tuleu, two
wonderful break-away tries
by Rob ‘I didn’t think he was
that fast’ Lawrence, and
a good solo effort off the
scrum by fresher Dowkes.
Apparently the man of the
match, Will ‘He’s an alright
captain’ Bolton also scored
a try, but got a knock on the
head so I wouldn’t take his
word for it. Canterbury did
score a try, but my memory
is pretty hazy on the details.
End score 55-5.
space roughly the size of
half a tennis court, with the
end goal of tagging as many
of the opposing team as
possible during solo raids
without getting wrestled to the
ground. Points are scored for
successful tags as well as a
sturdy defence. Sounds simple
enough, right?
It’s a Wednesday afternoon
and I find myself doing laps
in a small exercise room,
followed by a Sun Salutation
yoga stretch taken directly
from Kabaddi’s Indian origins.
We were taken straight into
some drills where the breadth
of knowledge and experience
of the guys taking the session
was immediately evident. Did
I mention they represent their
National team? These guys
as a tag is attempted, it all
culminates into an enthralling
experience.
You won’t see my
name on the back of an
England Kabaddi team shirt
anytime soon, but I can say
that I thoroughly enjoyed
this new adventure. It’s an
amazing workout, a perfect
combination of camarade-
rie and sportsmanship and
an honour to have a club
with such prestige at our
University. I urge you to give
it a go and contact the club
via the union site as soon as
you’ve read the rest of the
sports section.
Want to see some in action?
Go along to the Kabaddi Cup
hosted right here at Imperial
on the 5th
of November in the
Great Hall – an unforgettable
experience!
