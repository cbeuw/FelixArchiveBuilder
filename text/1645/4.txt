An idiot’s guide to the US Election
Not to say you’re an idiot, but at least one of the candidates is

emember 2012? The
London Olympics,
(almost) the end of
the world and the
last US presidential
election? Well fast
forward four years and we’ve
had another set of Olympics,
another election cycle is
coming to a climax and, if you
believe everything people are
saying on Twitter, the world is
coming to its end if either of the
frontrunning candidates wins
the race to the White House.
But what does it all mean I
hear you ask, who’s running,
what are they running for, and
how on earth have we got to
this point? Shhhh it’s going to
be all right. Matt’s here.
How did we get here?
The United States has quite
a complex system of selection
rounds to get down to its final
candidates for each party.
A system which involves ‘pri-
maries’ and ‘caucuses’ which
can be either open or closed.
These spawn delegates (which
are assigned via various forms
of witchcraft), some ‘superdel-
egates’ are thrown into the
mix, and then at each party’s
convention their presidential
candidate is chosen.
Realistically only the Demo-
crat and Republican nominees
have any chance of winning
and the rest may not even get
a single electoral college vote
(more on this later). Some
weird complications and quirks
of the rules could gift the
outsiders the presidency but
take it as the next president
will almost definitely be either
Donald Trump or Hillary
Clinton. (A more in depth look
at the selection system can be
found in felix 1624.)
The candidates
the forefront of the news over
the past few months, at times
even superseding the fallout
of Brexit. The businessman,
former Apprentice host, and
hair spray enthusiast has
pitched himself as an outsider,
someone to challenge the
current way of doing politics.
This is factually true as Trump
has never held elected office,
been a federal government
official or held a high ranking
military post (all other presi-
dents have).
Delving deeper into Trump
we see some more worry-
ing statements on women,
Mexicans and Muslims (and
these are just the headlining
ones). From a blanket ban
on Muslims entering the US
to ‘help’ combat terrorism,
to bragging about sexual
assault in the infamous ‘pussy
grabbing’ audio from 2005,
it’s been a campaign that even
Malcolm Tucker would find
hard to spin (Nigel Farage did
give it a shot though). But he
still, even as these deplorable
character traits have come to
light, is polling at around 45%
of the popular vote. But why?
Because in some cases voters
are willing to overlook these
things.
For the sects of the American
population that feel disenfran-
chised with current politics and
for whom the current govern-
ment is nowhere near helping
them, Trump is seen in some
respects as a chance-at-turn-
ing-this-around move. People
are witnessing banks and cor-
porations prospering far more
than themselves and want to
change the shift of power back
to the citizens. Any precedent
for this happening? *cough*
Brexit *cough*.
Trump is also the Repub-
lican nomination and huge
swathes of the US are very
conservative and socially
right wing. Looking over
his personal views people
do agree with some of his
stances. Or do they? Well
that depends which interview
and statement you believe
of his. He’s been pro and
anti gun legislation, pro and
anti abortion and has been
very economical with the
truth regarding his business
dealings. He even claimed, in
a hard hitting 1990 interview
with Playboy, that if he were
to run, it would most likely be
on a Democratic platform.
Has Trump changed his
mind over the years, is he a
secret centrist politician, or is
he simply just pandering to
whoever is listening to him?
The only way we’ll likely find
out either way, is if he gets
into office, so in the words of
Trump/Dale Winton, “Bring
on the wall!”
Donald Trump
The man needs almost no
introduction and has been at
Gary Johnson
As the Libertarian Party
candidate, Johnson’s policies
are largely that government
should take as little interest
in the lives of its subjects as
possible. Johnson seems
to be taking the same
Hillary Clinton
At a glance, Clinton seems
a pretty good candidate. She
has experience in politics, as
First Lady with her husband
Bill in the 1990’s, later as a
New York senator, and then
as Secretary of State under
Obama. She has also been
heavily involved in The Clin-
ton Foundation, a charitable
organisation funding projects
worldwide on a whole host
of issues. Sounds wonderful,
right? Well kinda. There’s
more to some of these points
than meets the eye. Clinton
as Secretary of State was
‘responsible’ for the Beng-
hazi incident (in which four
Americans were killed in a US
diplomatic outpost in Libya,
including the ambassador)
and this has been set upon by
critics who sense a cover-up/
scandal (not implausible).
Like with most 70-year-olds,
emails aren’t Hillary’s strong
point. In essence, emails
shouldn’t have been on cer-
tain servers and then emails
were deleted when they
shouldn’t have been. An FBI
investigation was launched,
no sanctions were brought
against her, but it’s an
ongoing saga. If it escalates
while she’s in office it could
potentially lead to impeach-
ment. Trump could also have
the same happen should
he be found guilty of fraud
regarding Trump University
(really) in a trial that starts
later this year.
Her relationship with Wall
Street has come under fire
too. After giving a set of
speeches to Goldman Sachs
as part of her foundation’s
work, how disconnected from
them she really is remains to
be seen. Clinton’s stance on
Syria and no fly zones could
(key word being could) send
the US into a conflict with
Russian forces in tandem with
Syria and would involve large
scale military deployments.
War with Russia isn’t ideal
(duh) but like Trump, she’s
been known to flip flop over
the years and whether this
policy would stand, only time
will tell.
\\ Like with most
70-year-olds, emails

strong point \\
Even the Capitol Building is looking apocalyptic \\ Stephen Melkisethian
on complex issues. Johnson is
very heavily pro legalisation
of marijuana (all drugs actu-
ally) and has forced himself
to quit smoking pot during his
campaign. (How reassuring
that this is, him on peak form.)
He’s the perennial third party
candidate/protest vote and
will likely garner a single
digit chunk of the vote but no
electoral college votes.
Jill Stein
Stein, an ex-Physician, has
grand plans to eradicate
student debt, ensure that the
US runs on clean and green
energy by 2030 (no nuclear
allowed), and take action on
climate change. Essentially
she’s the antithesis of Johnson
on most issues, campaigning
on a ticket that includes a $15
minimum wage (that’s about
£5 £20 £15 an hour for all of
you keeping track at home),
demilitarised borders in order
to not deter immigration, and
an increase in gun-control
measures. Similarity comes in
the form of being a long shot
for the big job, Stein is polling
even lower than Johnson
and is not even on the ballot
paper in some states.
Evan McMullin
McMullin has slipped under
the radar, even to most Amer-
icans, but this isn’t a worry
for him. His main appeal
lies solely in his home state
of Utah where the typically
Republican state isn’t best
pleased with Trump. Instead
they see McMullin’s politics
and his Mormon faith as a
better alternative than either
of the main two candidates.
Because McMullin is not affili-
ated with any specific political
party, should he win he would
become the first non-parti-
san candidate since George
Washington in 1792 to win a
state. How exciting.
Overall, not the greatest
bunch of candidates the US
has ever had.
\\ Handy if you’re
a convict, Richard
Nixon or a turkey \\
The United States employs
a weird system in which a
candidate needs to win a
majority of the 538 votes up
for grabs in the ‘electoral
college’. Each of the 50 states
has two Senators and then
a varying number of districts
(anywhere from 1 to 53) each
with a representative who sits
in the aptly named House of
Representatives. The number
of districts a state has is
determined by its population
and the average district holds
710,000 eligible voters.
Because these lines are
only redrawn every ten years
and the number of people
of voting age (18+) changes
over this period, all votes
aren’t created equal. This
becomes even more so when
you chuck in the rounding of
votes (as each state must have
a whole number of represent-
atives and hence votes) and
the two bonus, Senator, votes
that every state gets.
But wait, 435 + (2 x 50) =
535 electoral college votes,
not 538. In addition there’s
Washington DC which does
not actually lie in a state but
instead is it’s own district, the
District of Columbia (not to
be confused the University
of Columbia or indeed the
country of Colombia). This
district gets 3 votes, taking the
total to 538.
Each state then goes to
the polls on the first Tuesday
in November (postponed a
week if it’s November 1st
like
this year) and the winner
of each state wins all the
electoral college votes for
that state. As with everything
in the US election there’s
always exceptions, this time
it’s Maine and Nebraska.
These award their two senate
votes to the overall winner in
the state and then the winner
of each district gets that
district’s vote. What the whole
system also means is that a
candidate could win the most
number of actual votes in the
US and still lose the majority
of electoral college votes and
hence the overall race. This
happened famously in 2000
(after a recount in Florida
meant less than 600 votes
decided the president) as well
as in 1876 and 1888.
approach with current events,
showcased by his “what is
Aleppo?” comment in an
interview about the conflict in
Syria. This isn’t the first time
he’s been perplexed in an
interview mind you, he’s been
oblivious as to what the Trans
Pacific Partnership entailed,
struggled to name a foreign
leader, and been generally
sketchy on knowing details
The actual race
With the winner takes all
system, the most populous
states of (California, Texas
etc) are heavily targeted
in the race and the smaller
states are often forgotten
about. Swing states, in which
the race is tight, are priori-
tised too as capturing voters
here is far more important
than losing by a bit less in the
states you’re almost guaran-
teed to lose.
Long story short, barring
any massive surge from third
parties, it’ll become a two
horse race to win 270 elec-
toral college votes and sweep
the presidency. In the unlikely
(but ever increasing) chance
that they tie, then the House
of Representatives will choose
the next US president out of
the top 3 candidates with
The way the US govern-
ment is set up, it’s designed
to be slow and inefficient.
The House of Representatives
and the Senate (collectively
known as Congress) each
have to pass any motions the
president tries to enact and
if they’re controlled by the
opposition party then com-
promises have to be made at
the very least. The president
does have a lot of sway as a
person though and above all
has a presidential veto on any
motion that passes Congress
(mostly).
The president is also the
Commander in Chief of
the military and has the
power over them to do with
as he sees fit (mostly). The
most important thing for us
non-Americans is the diplo-
matic power the President
has, the power to negotiate
Executive Agreements (kind
of like treaties), and other
foreign policy stuff. Presiden-
tial pardons are also a pretty
powerful thing the President
can use, handy if you’re a
convict, Richard Nixon or a
turkey.
Polling officially starts in
some places at midnight in
their state’s time zone (4am
Tuesday GMT) and within a
few minutes the results of Dix-
ville Notch, New Hampshire
will be released due to their
electorate being around 20.
Around six hours later (10am
GMT) the rest of the country’s
polling stations will begin to
open over six time zones and
will start closing anywhere
from 7pm to 8pm local time
(11pm to 4am GMT) and then
after that states are called
pretty rapidly. Usually by
around 5am the result should
be known but any legal
challenges in the event of a
close race could drag on for
a while. The 2000 election
wasn’t called for 36 days for
instance.

feine, stock up on supersized
snacks, and watch as the
world holds its breath.
electoral college votes (this
is a third party’s only chance
of being president). Currently
the Republicans hold the
House but all those seats are
up for grabs on the same day
and may swing back to the
Democrats.
Tuesday’s timetable
But what does it matter?
In theory the President’s
power is limited by the consti-
tution and so a Trump/Clinton
presidency wouldn’t give them
free reign entirely. However,
the constitution is vague and a
President with a lack of respect
for established conventions
*cough* Trump *cough* could
take the limits of the constitu-
tional rules for the president to
their very edge.
