oes comedy
television have
the power to
change political
conversation? On
the face of it, the
purpose of satirical news is
to reflect the headlines, draw
humour from what seems
often to be ever deepening
pit of despair. ‘Look up, do
you see it? Way up there-
that’s rock bottom,’ remarked
John Oliver a few weeks
ago on Last Week Tonight in
response to the latest Trump
scandal.
In America, comedy news
shows have evolved from a
platform for clever jokes to
an increasingly impassioned
closer look at the state of the
country and its affairs. More
than the actual news, liberal
comedy has become the bas-
tion of progressive debate.
This shift may well be the
legacy of Jon Stewart, who
during his 16 year reign at
the helm of The Daily Show,
made his mantra on bullshit:
‘If you smell something, say
something.’
Several of the comedians
who have taken up the mantle
of activism through comedy
started their careers on The
Daily Show under Stewart’s
tutelage. Samantha Bee is
one such comedian. When
Jon Stewart retired earlier
this year, Bee, who had been
a long time correspondent
on the show, was for many,
one of the favourites to fill the
position. She quashed any
hopes that she might take
over by choosing to create
her own show, and it may
well prove to be the best deci-
sion of her career.
Full Frontal With Samantha
Bee is a show built in The
Bee is akin to listening to
your smartest, funniest, more
eloquent friend rant about
the election. It’s not gag-a-
minute, but it rings truer,
and hits harder than overly
polished puns.
Full Frontal often goes
beyond the headlines to
find local stories and wider
context issues. Over the
previous weeks, Bee has
tackled the rise of the Alt-
Right, the descent of the
GOP into the clutches of its
Tea Party extremist, she has
tackled abortion laws, gun
rights, LGBTQ, and the hold
of the church over healthcare.
She tackles these issues with
vehemence, and a clarity of
purpose that goes beyond
trying to get some laughs in.
There is a sense that Bee
wants to make a difference,
a desire to engage the dis-
enfranchised young people
who want to get involved
but don’t always know all
the facts, and not just be an
echo chamber for liberals.
This desire to be better than
her predecessors extends
to behind the scenes. Bee
employs the greatest propor-
tion of female writers of any
of the comedy shows, and has
made efforts to amplify the
voices of her minority writers
rather than package and
present their views herself.
In a segment dealing with
Black History Month, it was
writer Ashley Black, not Bee,
who rubbished the white
conservatives that use Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘I have
a Dream’ speech to justify ‘all
lives matter’. She also called
for ‘Black Now Month’, a
month in which we celebrate

Daily image, the original
liberal satirical news behe-
moth. Yet, in hosting Full
Frontal, Bee has become
the first woman to host a
late night comedy show in
America. She is keen to step
out of Jon Stewart’s shadow
and create the equivalent of
Nicki Minaj’s ‘Pinkprint’ as
opposed to Jay Z’s ‘Blueprint’
if you will. At the beginning
of each episode, Bee strides
onto the stage in statement
blazers and skinny jeans like
a punk rock Angela Merkel
to the sounds of ‘Boys Wanna
Be Her’. Then, instead of
sitting behind a desk, she
stays standing for the whole
half hour. This is a superfi-
cial difference but belies a
more profound one. A sense
of urgency and anger runs
through Full Frontal; where
others shows quip with a deft
lightness, exasperated at the
political scene’s descent into
lunacy, Bee attacks. Watching
the work and lives of black
activists and heroes alive
today, rather than ruminate
on an imagined sixties.
The 2000 elections, with all
its twists and turns, and the
Bush presidency that followed
proved the making of Jon
Stewart. This election, with
its twists ripped straight from
Shonda Rimes’ most fevered
imaginings, is proving the
making of Samantha Bee.
Hers is a voice that is all too
rare in both comedy and pol-
itics: a fiercely liberal, angry,
sarcastic, and unapologeti-
cally feminist voice.
This week Bee interviewed
Barack Obama and travelled
to Russia to interview two
internet trolls employed by
the Russian state to spread
pro-Russian messages across
various internet platforms
whilst pretending to be
various characters including
‘a housewife from Nebraska’.
It’s a testament to Bee’s vision
and intent that she has been
able to make so much of her
show in its freshman run, as
well as an indictment of the
American news stations that
seem to be lagging far behind
their parody counterparts in
delivering cutting edge jour-
nalistic content.
If informing voters is a
tall task for a satirical news
show, surely it can’t be done
by a sketch show? Saturday
Night Live, though broadly
liberal, has never held any
grand political ambitions.
Yet, consistently, its political
impressions have shaped the
cultural landscape.
Legendary amongst them is
Tina Fey’s caricature of Sarah
Palin during the 2008 election
cycle, which cemented Palin’s
public image as a woman
clearly out of her depth and
manifestly unfit to be put in
charge of anything, much less
the country.
Amy Poehler portrayed
Hillary Clinton in 2008. Poe-
hler’s Clinton was the straight
man to the constellation of
eccentric characters that
swirled around her, adept
Baldwin’s Trump defending
the Access Hollywood tape
to Clinton HQ. McKinnon as
Clinton is swigging from a
champagne bottle, and trying
very hard to seem sober
and horrified rather than
overjoyed at this new turn
of events. She addresses the
women voting for Trump; ‘My
babies, ‘ya brain broke. Bish,
I love ya, but you cray.’ This
is a tender portrait of Clinton,
McKinnon has confessed
she finds Clinton ‘resplend-
ent’. That is not to say the
portrayal has no teeth; in
one sketch, Clinton, in order
to win the youth vote begins
to speak and act like Bernie
Sanders all the while claiming
she’s been saying it all for
years, in each transition
morphing into him a little bit
more. She ends the speech as
a white haired Jewish man in
a baggy suit. ‘Vote for me,’
says Hillary, ‘I can be who-
ever you want me to be.’
As anyone who witnessed
McKinnon’s turn as Jillian
Holtzmann in The Ghostus-
ters reboot will know, it is
almost impossible to watch
Kate McKinnon and not be
charmed.
McKinnon won an Emmy
earlier this year, and thanked
Hillary Clinton in her speech.
If all goes accordingly for
Clinton, on November 8th
she
may well thank McKinnon,
who has achieved what no
PR manager has managed to

Kate McKinnon has taken
on the role in the last couple
of years, and her Clinton
is an altogether different
beast. McKinnon’s Clinton is
power-crazed, socially inept,
frighteningly formal, and
yet despite all this, endlessly
endearing; she is allowed
to be eccentric and slightly
mad. In one scene stealing

news reporter, cuts from Alec

do in 30 years; she has made
Hillary Clinton likeable.
Elections, and this one more
than most, will be decided
by the youth. Young voters
in America are increasingly
turned off by the partisan
bias that inflict most main-
stream media news sources.
Instead, they are turning to
comedy shows, YouTube clips,
and online articles to form
an opinion. As they do so,
they will be influenced by the
choices that Bee, McKinnon,
and comedians like them
make.
