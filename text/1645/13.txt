single mother at home, a
college education on the hori-
zon, and now all she needs to
do is to win the election.
Unfortunately, she’s not the
only one in the competition.
Paul Meltzer (Chris Klein), a
dim-witted by affable jock,
is convinced to run by Jim
McAllister (Matthew Broder-
ick), a very popular history
teacher who has a vendetta
against Tracy after she had
an affair with his best friend
– another teacher, who was
subsequently fired. Paul is
highly popular amongst the
student body, despite his lack
of clear qualifications for the
role of president; his speech
to the students in hustings is
meandering, and made up
entirely of platitudes about
how he worked through
breaking his leg and scored
a winning touchdown against
Westside School. Paul is also
enormously wealthy, with his
cement-baron father furnish-
ing his comfortable lifestyle.
Sound familiar?
The comparison between
Election and this current elec-
tion cycle couldn’t really be
clearer. There’s even a Gary
Johnson-esque character to
be found in Tammy Meltzer
(Jessica Campbell), who runs
as an anti-authoritarian can-
didate, questioning the very
process of the election. And,
I’m not the first one to think
so: The Atlantic, Huffington
Post, and The Cut have all run
articles about the uncanny
comparison. Like Clinton, Flick
is a woman with an extremely
prolific track record, who is
clearly very intelligent and
astute, but has difficulties
connecting emotionally with
her electorate. As Tracy says
herself in the film: ‘The pres-
sures women face mean you
have to work twice as hard,
and you can’t let anything or
anyone stand in your way.’
But Trump is no Paul
Metzler, and this isn’t high
school. What makes Tracy
such a ridiculous character
is that she doesn’t seem to
understand how little the high
school election matters: she is
seen as cut-throat and bitchy
against the others simply
because they refuse to take
things as seriously as she
does. But while Tracy might
seem like a nasty woman in
the course of the film, really
that behaviour is par for the
course in the political arena,
something we realise when
Mr McAllister attempts to sab-
otage her campaign, in order
to teach her a lesson. What
makes Tracy a ‘nasty woman’
is really simply what makes
a politician a politician:
steadfastness, competitive-
ness, and a general disregard
for others. To call Clinton a
‘nasty woman’ is to imply that
Trump is virtuous, that he has
the moral high-ground; Trump
may claim that he has busi-
ness acumen, all his own hair,
and a huge dick, but claiming
a higher sense of morals than
Clinton might be a bridge too
far.

iolent. Destructive.
Catastrophic.
These may be the
words you think of
when encountering
the word volcano.
Werner Herzog, one of the
world’s most influential directors,
together with volcanologist Clive
Oppenheimer, take you on a trip
to the heart of the earth, with
the question: are volcanoes all
destructive?
From Pacific islands to North
Korea, this film shows how volca-
noes help to construct people’s
belief systems. Some are very
mystical, such as the belief that
spirits live in the lava and com-
municate with the local villagers.
Volcanoes are often perceived to
be a source of power with these
beliefs so firmly ingrained into
the societies that in some villages,
tourists are not permitted into the
area after an eruption as the fire
spirit would not recognize them
and would be angry.
The film explains why people
form such beliefs; volcanoes are
mysterious and unpredictable.
We feel helpless due to our lack
of control over them and even
armed with cutting-edge tech-
nologies and equipment, we still
can’t fully explain the fascinating
power of nature. Just as Herzog
said after his observation of volca-
noes: “There’s no permanence to
what we are doing, no perma-
nence to the efforts of human
beings” – we are insignificant
compared to its power. As a result,
we respond with respect and awe.
Volcanoes both destroy and create
and are shown to carry sufficient
energy to fulfil all human needs.
When facing something this
powerful, the first reaction is to
run as fast as you can to avoid
being swallowed and absorbed
by the mighty force. The next is to
pray; before a disaster, for safety
and good health; after, for peace
of mind and rejuvenation. This is
shown to be true for all natural
disasters. Some survivors of floods,
for example, bring tributes to the
‘God of the Sea’ in exchange for a
peaceful year. Amidst the spiritual
beliefs, people learn to predict
and prepare for future disasters.
Interestingly these natural disasters
while being immensely destruc-
tive also help to form human
culture, beliefs and creativity. This
comparison is emphasised by the
director frequently pairing the
violent ocean with the exploding
volcanoes to give a strong visual
contrast. The dance of the fire
synchronises with the rhythm of
the waves, expressing the infinite
power of nature in front of our
eyes. While listening to
peaceful harmonious classical
background music, one can
feel the strong impact of
lava being pushed out of the
crater, like spirits fighting for
their freedom.
‘Into the Inferno’ exposes
how fragile human beings
are in the face of nature
whilst also showing us to be
conscious and wise creatures.
These harsh conditions make
us who we are, just as the
selective pressure which has
evolved us to Homo Sapiens
in these two million years.
We evolve creative solutions
towards difficulties. We learnt
from birds to fly, we learnt
from bats to use ultrasound
waves to create radar sys-
tems. Humans always learn
from nature and create tools
to face challenges.
The documentary ends on
an ominous prediction by the
leader of the Endu village,
Chief Mael, “ Volcanoes will
destroy everything. They will
destroy the whole world”.
What do you think the future
of human and volcano will
be?
