Weed | The politics of legalisation
It’s the day after the 2015 General Election. I, a
Labour voter, am heartbroken, and have just spent
four hours on a coach to visit my tory-voting then-boy-
friend. I’m pleasantly surprised by the lack of
gloating and the sex has temporarily taken my mind
off of my woes – that is until he, mid-thrust, looks
me straight in the eye, says “You are Ed Miliband”,
demands that I call him David Cameron, and contin-
ues with gusto. I’m so taken off guard that I oblige,
but am now plagued by the harrowing mental image
of poor Ed’s resignation speech. Never trust a tory.
I once slept with an artist, who lived in the attic of a
house by the sea in Wales. After we’d finished having
sex (which was no mean feat, considering the paints,
canvasses, and easels I’d had to climb over to get to
the futon in the corner), he took off the condom, tied
the end in a knot, and carried it over the the skylight.
He opened the window, and tossed the condom out
on the the roof, but before it landed, it was caught
in mid-flight by a seagull, who promptly carried it
away. I still don’t know if he and the seagull had it
prearranged.
I was seeing this guy from America. He was only
here for one semester and he was staying in these
American Halls near Portland Street. After a few
dates we wanted to go back to his, but there were
no guests allowed, so I was snuck in with a crowd of
people. We got into his bedroom and he said that
we had to be really quiet because of the no guests
rule. He then proceeded to get undressed and said
that there was something he liked to do that helped
him keep it quiet. I said that sounded like fun. He then
reached behind his pillow and picked up a Batman
mask. He put it on and said in the typical Batman
voice “I’m Batman”. I was freaked out, but was also a
bit drunk, so I dealt with it and we continued. About
30 seconds later he asks, “can you tell me a riddle?”
and then shouts “YOU’RE THE JOKER! THE JOKER,
THE JOKER I SAY!”. I freak out, (a) because wtf, and
(b) because he shouted it. I quickly left the room and
looked the exit to leave. On my way out, the recep-
tionist simply says, “Batman guy?”
So I’d just got off work, at around ten, and I was
meeting this guy, a doctor who was also finishing
work. We met outside Charing Cross Hospital, and
went to the Southern Belle for a drink. We had our
drink, and as I was walking him back home, we
clearly couldn’t wait any longer, and started to make
out on Margravine Road. At this point he just kneels
down, lowers my trousers, and proceeds to suck me
off, right there on the street. I came on his face, he
laughed, I laughed, and we awkwardly bid our fare-
wells. He messaged me the following week. I never
replied.
This one time there were five of us at a ‘hang-out’.
Everyone was really chill and sensual, the vibes were
great and we were all generally really enjoying each
other’s company. At some point I noticed that one of
the guys was missing, but I didn’t really care at the
time considering there were another three people
to keep my hands occupied. Until he reappeared.
He ran into our entangled bodies without warning,
and slipped between us like an eel. He had covered
himself in oil. I thought it was massage oil until I got
a mouthful and realised it was actually olive oil. He
messaged me once afterwards. He said I probably
didn’t remember him. I answered I couldn’t possibly
forget olive oil guy. He never messaged me again.
I met a guy in Tiger Tiger and went back to his, he
had a nice flat, I go into the bedroom to see a HUGE
Great Dane on his bed. I like dogs, but this dog was
taking up the entire bed. The guy comes into the
bedroom. Not thinking the dog was an issue and
continues on as though the dog wasn’t there. I stop
him, and ask about the dog. The guy says “Oh don’t
worry, he will move, he knows when”, and so we go
on. Then the guy attempts to throw me onto the bed, I
land on top of the dog, and the man climbs on. Now
I’m effectively in a sandwich between a half naked
man and his giant dog. I stop the man like, “the dog
gotta move”, and the man reluctantly gets up and
shooshes the dog out of the room. To this day I still
don’t know why he felt the need to throw me on top
of his dog.
I was talking to a casual lover who happened to
live on my street. The conversation was getting quite
heated and I was thinking of inviting him over when
he said he had a weird favour to ask me. I tell him
to go ahead and he proceeds to ask me whether he
could borrow some lube. Surprised and rather disap-
pointed I say sure, but warn him that I have one big
bottle rather than individual single serving packets.
Unfazed he reassures me it’ll be fine. Ten minutes
later, he’s knocking on my door. I let him in and take
him up to my room at where he whips a glass out of
his coat pocket. I squirt some lube in the glass, he
thanks me and heads off. Ten minutes later I get a
message from him saying I’m welcome to join. Nope.

In the final leg of the
presidential debate a few
days ago, supporters of
Republican nominee Donald
Trump started spreading fake
memes under the hashtag
#StopThePot in an attempt to
mislead voters about Demo-
cratic presidential nominee
Hillary Clinton's marijuana
policy. Marijuana legalisa-
tion is a hot topic in the USA
right now, especially amongst
young people. If young,
naive voters who haven't
followed the election believed
the memes, they might have
become less likely to vote for
Clinton at the ballot. Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump
have shifted opinions on
marijuana in recent years
and although both of them
seem quite cautious around
the topic of recreational
marijuana use, Clinton
appears to have a more spe-
cific, less stigmatising stance
on it than Trump.
Clinton has repeatedly
stated that she wants to move
marijuana from a Schedule I
drug to a Schedule II drug, as
well as to end incarceration
of marijuana users. Trump
stated that medical marijuana
is something that should be
considered, but legalisa-
tion should be left up to the
individual states. When ques-
tioned on the effectiveness of
marijuana legalisation in the
state of Colorado, Trump said
that it was not exactly going
trouble-free and that weed
could have a negative impact
on people’s health and cogni-
tive abilities.
Besides the subjective views
of the presidential candidates,
their campaign promises,
and whether their mild
pro-mj support will translate
into real policies and laws,
it is also worth noting that
there are several important
groups opposed to the legal-
isation of marijuana. Police
departments have become
dependent on federal drug
war grants to finance their
budget. Private prison cor-
porations make millions by
incarcerating people who
have been imprisoned for
drug crimes. Alcohol and
tobacco companies have
lobbied to keep marijuana
out of reach and of course
big pharma would like to
keep marijuana illegal so
Americans don’t have access
to cheap medical alternatives
to their products.
Purdue Pharma and Abbott
Laboratories, makers of
the painkillers OxyContin
and Vicodin are among the
biggest contributors to the
Anti-Drug Coalition of Amer-
ica, and the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers
of America, considered one
of the legalisation movement’s
biggest opponents, spent
nearly $19m lobbying last
year.
In the end, based on what
both candidates have or
haven’t said during the
presidential race, the national
outlook for weed might not
look all too different in a
Clinton presidency than it
would under Trump. Then
again, maybe their corporate
liaisons will make all the dif-
ference in the world.
Whilst the argument rages
around recreational mari-
juana use in the US, here in
the UK we are having our
own discussion, albeit slightly
more refined and subtle than
our American cousins.
Legal or decriminalised
for medical usage in 25 US
states, I hear many people
asking, “Why is the marijuana
debate so lethargic here in
the UK?” Whilst there are
many potential explanations,
one of the most striking is the
will of our political parties.
At the last general election,
both Labour and the Con-
servatives campaigned under
the banner of abstinence.
With Labour opting for a
catchy tagline of “We will
ban the sale and distribution
of dangerous psychoactive
substances”. Whilst the
Conservatives opted for an
equally fetching “Abstinence
and full recovery is the goal”.
When policies such as these
are quoted from the UK’s two
largest political parties we
can hardly expect any form
of large scale drug reform.
Meanwhile, the Liberal
Democrats opted for a more
(perhaps unsurprisingly)
liberal approach. In 2015
they campaigned under the
proviso “Establish a review to
assess the effectiveness of the
cannabis legalisation exper-
iments in the United States
and Uruguay in relation to
public health and criminal
activity”, which seems to take
some form of inspiration from
the successes of the Amer-
ican model. Furthermore,
the Green Party adopted
a similar proposal with the
manifesto quote “Adopt an
evidence-based approach to
step-by-step regulation, start-
ing with cannabis”. However,
it is more likely that we will
hear Hillary Clinton say the
words ‘Make America great
again’ than we are to see a
Liberal Democrat and Green
Party coalition.
With the Conservative party
in a shambles over Brexit and
Jeremy Corbyn looking as
incompetent as Ed Milib-
and, it likely there will be no
domestic reform regarding
marijuana use. With the two
major political parties of the
UK distracted by issues such
as these, don’t expect any far
reaching drug reform policy
in the foreseeable future. Cur-
rently, the marijuana debate
appears to have been put
in the corner like a naughty
child.
Although here in the UK we
often view ourselves as more
liberally progressive than
our counterparts in the US, it
appears that this time, due to
the insufficient will of our poli-
ticians, those across the pond
may actually beat us to it.
USA | Hilary vs.
Trump, but does
it really make a
difference?
