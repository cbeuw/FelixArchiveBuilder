fter its
successful
debut at
HighTide
Festival in
Suffolk last
year, Harrogate - written
by Al Smith and directed by
Richard Twyman – arrives in
London at the Royal Court
to kick off its UK wide tour.
The one act play, coming in
at just over 80 minutes, finds
itself perfectly suited to the
cosy Jerwood Theatre at the
Court. In a rather unique set
design, audience members
face each other from benches
(which are perhaps just a bit
too cosy) on either side of the
room. The stage itself sits in
the middle; a medical-white
cuboid running the length
of the room, with its two
bench-facing sides missing.
It’s more reminiscent of a zoo
exhibition than a theatre, and
being able to see the faces
of half your fellow attendees
can be rather off-putting,
especially when one of
them nods off during scene
two. We’ll put that down to
the humidity in the room,
however, because the play
and performances from Nigel
Lindsay (of Four Lions fame)
and Sarah Ridgeway are
brilliant.
Anyone Who Knows What
Love Is (Will Understand) sig-
nals the start of the play. “You
can blame me, try to shame
me, and still I’ll care for you”,
sings Irma Thomas; I love it
when a seemingly insignifi-
cant song encapsulates an
entire piece perfectly. A
father is joined in the kitchen
by his daughter, where-
upon she shows off her new
uniform, dodges questions
about what she’s learnt in
school, and chats about her
new job at a carvery. Boring,
right? But something is off.
Her father happily pours
her not one but two pretty
hefty glasses of Baileys,
even though she’s only 15,
and then proceeds to scold
her for wearing mascara.
Dad knows all his daughter’s
favourite GCSE subjects,
one of which is Biology. She,
however, doesn’t even know
what osmosis is. Weirdest of
all, their rapport is remark-
able. Maybe you were less
of an angst-ridden teenager
than I was, but the last thing
in the world I wanted to do
at 15 was relay every detail
of my life to my parents. The
daughter, on the other hand,
revels in it. By mid-scene I’ve
decided that Smith simply
doesn’t know how to write
young characters and I’m
dreading the remaining hour
in the sweaty theatre. Then,
in the last 20 seconds of the
scene, it clicks. The whole
scene comes together and it’s
literally jaw dropping. It’s not
themselves – it’s impossible to
want anything other than the
inevitable to occur. “Do it”
one audience member whis-
pers behind me. It’s edge of
the seat viewing. Again, quite
literally; I could see them
perched across from me.
In scene two Harrogate
lose its spark a little. It dithers
for just long enough that my
eyes wander to the sleeping
attendee, and our actors go
from dry-eyed to inconsola-
ble crying in the blink of an
eye; it’s less than convincing.
Similarly, the final moments of
acting feel somewhat forced:

bad playwriting, it’s phenom-
enal playwriting.
The mastery of Harrogate
is that it does this more than
once; just when I think I’ve got
the play figured out it twists
again and I’m at a loss, but
still desperate to know the
truth. To reveal any significant
details of the play’s plot
would ruin the viewing; suffice
to say it’s shocking, and some-
times horrific. Despite this,
as the play approaches its
finale – and the true nature of
events have finally revealed

I read the stage directions, it
could have been done better.
Someone across the way is
even lightly chuckling to them-
selves at this point, by which
time I’ve decided I don’t like
the set.
In the end, such minor blips
do little to damage what is
a brilliantly written play. It
tackles a subject matter I have
seen not seen addressed on
the stage with seriousness and
grace, while remembering
that to entertain its audience
is the most important task.
Sadly, Harrogate’s remaining
dates at the Royal Court are
sold out, but it will be touring
the UK throughout November.
Having been so well received
not once but twice now in
the last two years however, it
wouldn’t be at all surprising if
we see it reincarnated in the
capital again very soon.

Oneiric
landscapes
of strange
enchantment
P
aul Nash was an
artist best known
for two things: his
portrayal of English
landscapes, and his
work as an official
artist in both World Wars.
Nature and war - two seem-
ingly irreconcilable themes,
are portrayed by Nash in his
own distinctive style. Born in
Kensington, he spent his early
years painting the scenery
of his country home in Buck-
inghamshire. Even in these
earliest works Nash imbues
his landscapes with character,
such as in The Three, where a
cluster of three elm trees form
a strange, vaguely menac-
ing figure that towers over
the surrounding farmland.
Nash was also a poet and a
writer, and his early symbolic
images of the sea, the moon,
and the night (themes that
would recur in his later works)
were accompanied by verses
penned by his own hand.
Nash was enlisted as a
private in 1914 as WWI
was breaking out. By 1917
when he returned to the
Western Front as an official
war artist, his initial ideal-
ism had been completely
shattered. In a letter to his
wife, he wrote, “Sunset and
sunrise are blasphemous…
It is unspeakable, godless,
hopeless.” Nash no longer
saw himself as an artist, but
as a messenger whose role
was to expose the horrors of
war. Being the great nature-
lover that he was, Nash
portrayed the brutality of
war not in bloody scenes of
carnage, but in landscapes
violated and destroyed. In
his cynically titled work We
Are Making A New World,
the black and blasted stumps
of trees point starkly from
the gouged earth towards
a blood-red sky; almost a
denunciation. Also on display
is The Menin Road, a large oil
painting showing two soldiers
struggling along a surreal
landscape pockmarked with
shell-holes and detritus. The
soldiers are dwarfed in the
hostile landscape, the path
is barely visible, and once
again truncated tree-trunks
point impotently at the sky.
Suffering from emotional
shock, Nash moved to the
seaside village of Dymchurch
to recuperate after the
war. The sea, as well as the
Dymchurch seawall, were the
subject matter for a number
of paintings he created. It
was also at this time when
he began to experiment
more with geometric and
abstracted shapes. In the
bleak and visually arresting
“Winter Sea”, monochromatic
waves roll in towards the
viewer, turning as they do so
into angular, unmoving frozen
sheets.
With Nash, one gets the
sense that objects are never

the Sunflower, a sunflower
withers and blooms with the
sun; in Flight of the Magnolia,
blossoms unfurl as clouds in
the sky.
Analogies aside, the iso-
lated subjects of Nash’s works
hide an occult significance
or symbolism. Set alone in a
desolate landscape, objects
like the metal scaffolding of
Pylons or the petrified piece
of wood in Stone Tree seem
to mean more than what
they are at face value. Nash
also placed large geometric
objects in the middle of his
landscapes, such as a cube
on the shore in Dymchurch
Steps or large abstract
figures in Equivalents for
the Megaliths. Displacing
something from its usual
context was, for Nash, a way
to provoke disquietude and
lend everyday objects an air
of surrealism. Juxtapositions
– between the object and the
landscape, between sea and
land, between the organic
and the abstract – can be
found everywhere in Nash’s
paintings.
His landscapes, though vast
and desolate, are charged
with a primal power and
mysterious symbolism. Devoid
of human figures, theirs is an
unsettling and empty world.
But as Rilke says, “beauty is
nothing but the beginning of
terror”. Their very strange-
ness makes them beautiful.
Endlessly confronting the
viewer, Nash’s works seem to
pose questions to which no
answers exist.

In Totes Meer, one of the
most famous images of WWII,
the jagged crests of a roiling
sea threaten to crash onto an
adjacent plain. But a closer
look reveals it to be static and
dead – the twisted carcasses
of German airplanes under
the moon. Drawing parallels
between objects and things
larger than themselves was
a theme he continued to
explore even in his last works.
