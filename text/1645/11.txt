ooking for a startling
way to open your
movie? A slow-
motion montage of
obese elderly women
dancing, completely
naked save for cheerleading
pom-poms and marching
band hats, ought to do the
trick. Nocturnal Animals, the
latest feature from fashion-
bigwig-turned-film-director
often serves to be mocked
by filmmakers who wish to
appear avant-garde; when
Susan accidentally breaks
the phone of one of her
colleagues, she’s told not to
worry – “the new one comes
out next week”. That Ford
opted for such a vitriolic
representation of the art
world might seem worrying
to anyone who hasn’t yet
seen the film, as if he’d spent
approximately $22 million
writing a bitter letter to an ex,
but fear not; Nocturnal Ani-
mals is a lush, thrilling drama
that carries as much narrative
focus as it does emotional
heft, and is a strong testament
that as a director, Ford has
finally found his true calling.
For the first five minutes
of the film, Susan paces
languidly around her world,
populated chiefly by a distant
second husband (Armie
Hammer) and a handful of
friends even crazier than
herself (played in brilliantly
exaggerated single-scene
performances from Andrea
Riseborough and Michael
in the film is her mother
– another caricature, this
time of a racist, misogynistic
upper-class Texan – who is
portrayed with a marvellously
steely edge of cynicism and
brimstone by Laura Linney.
This doesn’t bode well for
Susan’s situation as a female
artist in a man’s world. On
top of this, Gyllenhaal’s
real-life Edward is constantly
labelled as “weak” during the
flashback sequences (a theme
which is heavily reflected in
the thriller he has written); as
more is revealed about the
backstory between Susan
and Edward, and the fictional
thriller running parallel to it
turns more and more sour. In
fact we are led to question if
this novel Edward has written
is his way of showing her
that he is no longer weak, or
exacting bitter revenge.
Despite its darkness,
Nocturnal Animals remains
intriguing and even entertain-
ing. Of course it should go
without saying that the film
is gorgeously shot, proving
that Ford has kept his eye
for beauty. He also proves
himself a startlingly adept
screenwriter, with dialogue
that drip-feeds exposition in a
subtle manner, and manages
a surprisingly large number
of laughs with a grim sense
of humour. I hope Susan
is not his mouthpiece when
she refers to her own work
as “junk”, as Nocturnal
Animals is an excellent piece
of cinema. It’s clear now that
he has found a new lease of
life as a director, so here’s to
hoping he continues to find it
for quite some time.

Sheen). A quiet weekend
alone at home is interrupted
by the arrival of a letter from
her first husband Edward
Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal)
after a silence of many
years, along with a finished
manuscript of his latest,
as-yet-unpublished, novel.
She begins to read it and is
sucked into a dark revenge
thriller that is played out in
full on the screen, in which the
protagonist Tony (who Susan
imagines to be Edward, i.e.
Gyllenhaal) has his family
abducted during a night drive
by a gang of young men led
by Ray (Aaron Taylor-John-
son). As she finishes reading
the opening of the novel,
flashbacks of her time with
Edward begin to appear, and
thus the three distinct timelines
of the film are established.
One of Nocturnal Animals’
most admirable achieve-
ments is that it manages
to make each storyline as
gripping as the others. The
dramatisation of the novel
that ostensibly takes place
inside Susan’s mind is rather
straightforward plot-wise, but
remains absorbing through-
out each scene, thanks in
no small part to a brace of
very strong performances.
Taylor-Johnson is captivat-
ing and dastardly as chief
psycho Ray, and Gyllenhaal
embodies the character arc of
Tony with perfect believabil-
ity, but Michael Shannon’s
performance as the detective
assigned to help Tony find
his family, steals every scene
he’s in. When his character
gets up-close-and-personal to
another during a monologue
– which, enjoyably, occurs
frequently – I could feel that
there wasn’t a person in the
cinema who wasn’t devoting
the entirety of their attention
to him.
The “real life” narrative
strand, however, has a much
more static, melancholic
atmosphere. For better or
worse, Susan is a character
whose own life and decisions
have stifled her. Despite her
sucessful career, it appears to
be her husband who brings
in the cash flow sufficient
for sustaining their glamor-
ous lifestyle. The only other

A dark
descent
into artistic
depths
Tom Ford, opens with such
a scene. Though a visual
echo to this opening occurs
later in the movie in a brief
strip bar scene, its meaning
is never quite explained.
There’s a suggestion that
this lack of explanation, or
lack of meaning, is entirely
the point: it’s revealed that
this display of dancers is
a new art installation by
successful gallery owner
Susan Monrow (Amy Adams),
and at a dinner a few scenes
later she describes her own
installation, with sincere
dejection, as “junk”.
Susan is one of the many
artists that populate one
of the multiple storylines of
Nocturnal Animals, and is not
alone in despising her own
work. Ford paints a hilari-
ously miserable caricature of
the art world he left behind;
it’s most likely no accident,
as the ex-creative director of
Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren
has said in interviews that
since the birth of his toddler,
he’s grown into a state of
“anti-materialism”. He even
makes a point of keeping the
characters shackled to the
consumer machine that so
