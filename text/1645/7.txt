aving watched
enough music
videos and
viewed the
odd ‘Rich Kids
of Instagram’
profile, it’s not unusual to
spot an exotic animal being
used as a power status
symbol or display of wealth
for social media. A tiger
padding over a marble floor,
a marmoset monkey hanging
from a chandelier, or a snake
being used as a prop in a
painstakingly well-lit selfie. All
the types of image that would
attract plenty of attention.
All vanity posts. The animal
having one purpose: to add to
the backdrop of money.
While I’m sure the vast
majority of exotic animal
owners do genuinely care
for these animals as beloved
pets, the new wave of exotic
pet ownership as a glorified
fashion statement is a trend
on the rise. And with it has
come a worrying increase in
cases of exotic animals being
neglected when owners are
insufficiently equipped to
provide for the animals’ needs.
This issue starts with the
ease of purchase. I had a
quick look online. It turns out
that on Gumtree I could have
bought a bearded dragon for
a mere £100, or perhaps two
pythons for £40. Mercifully
there were no tigers, panthers
or lions for sale on Gumtree,
but obviously these would
come with a significantly
heftier price tag. Yet, animal
welfare organisations have
reported there to be around
25,000 online advertisements
for the sale of exotic animals
on sites like buytigers.com. In
England a licence is required
before such ownership (under
the ‘Dangerous Wild Animals
Act’, 1976), but once you’ve
acquired that and enough
cash in the bank, you’re free
to buy an enormous wild
predator.
Oncetheanimalispurchased
and has raked in a couple of
hundred likes on an Instagram
post, there’s the small bother
of looking after it. Certainly
more precautions should be
taken and questions asked
before buying a panther as
opposed to your bog standard
domestic cat. What does it eat?
How much space is required?
Will it mistake my granny for
a tasty vole rat while we’re
trying to enjoy a family
Sunday roast? Sadly, when
these kind of responsibilities
and questions aren’t properly
thought through, issues
become apparent.
According to the Humane
Society, only 10% of the
15,000 tigers in the US live in
professionally regulated zoos
and sanctuaries, meaning
a large proportion of the
other 90% are confined to
someone’s house or garden.
For a naturally wide-ranging
animal, living in someone’s
home is a form of neglect
in itself, having detrimental
effects on health by causing
joint, muscle or circulatory
problems. Stating the obvious
here, tigers are also far more
likely to be involved in a fatal
attack on humans than other
domestic pets. In fact they are
360 to 720 times more likely
than dogs. And the story is
very much a similar one for
other big cats and predators.
Then there’s the small fluffy
animals,thosewhichfillthegap
in the market a Pomeranian-
cross-Pug-cross-Poodle never
could. Take the slo loris – a
big-eyed, bushy-tailed ball
of cuteness (you’ve probably
seen one of these in a video
having its armpits tickled).
Nocturnal animals with large
eyes are specially adapted
for seeing in darkness. In
captivity, though, they have
to adapt to the sleeping times
of their non- nocturnal owners
who want to spend time with
the lovable slo loris during the
day. Being kept in rooms with
bright artificial lighting and
spending an unnatural amount
of time awake in the daylight
hours is uncomfortable and
even painful for the slo loris’
eyes. People buying them also
struggle to meet the varied
dietary requirements of these
rainforest animals. They would
usually munch on a range of
fruits and insects from the
rainforest ecosystem – difficult
to find in the suburbs.
Clearly, exotic animals are
high maintenance, and too
often caring for them properly
becomes more hassle than
the good photos and social
media attention are worth.
The realisation dawns on the
owner that they’re not going
to find a lion-sized litter tray
at the nearest Pets at Home,
nor can an orangutan survive
off scraps of leftover pizza.
And while a chihuahua may
occasionally growl when
approached too close to its
food, one flash of pearly white
from a tiger would leave you
a shivering wreck in your own
home.
There’s a reason why we
generally stick to owning dogs,
cats, hamsters and so on. It’s
because they have undergone
generations of domestication
and become suited to living
with us. Exotic pets, on the
other hand, are ripped out
of their natural habitat and
propelled into domestic life.
Even if they have been bred
in captivity, their species still
hasn’t had the history of living
with humans needed to adapt
to our lifestyle.
It therefore seems entirely
unnatural for anyone to
privately own one of these
animals, especially if the main
intention is for the animal
to be part of the décor in
a narcissistic social media
facade. Impressive as the
vanity posts may appear
and healthy as the exotic
animals in them can look, the
chances are that that animal is
unhappy, ultimately because
a man-made life can never
compare to what they had in
the wild.
