U
nless you’ve been
living under a
cave for the last
few years, you
will have heard
of Elon Musk,
the founder of Tesla Motors,
SolarCity and SpaceX. This
South African born engineer,
inventor and progressive
thinker is on a quest to save
mankind from itself through
renewable energy, space
exploration and by tackling
whatever global issue he sets
his mind on. Musk has often
been compared to a real life
Tony Stark.
Only days ago, he unveiled
yet another revolutionary
idea: a roof made entirely
of solar panels, which would
provide electricity to an entire
home. The launch was held on
the set for Desperate House-
wives, at Universal Studios
in Los Angeles, where one
house was chosen as a pro-
totype to demonstrate how
the roof would appear. You
may be wondering what these
high-tech roofs look like. Well,
each solar panel has been
designed to appear indistin-
guishable from conventional
roof shingles. Even more, the
façade was created through
an optical illusion, where the
tiles appear opaque when
seen from the ground, but
transparent when facing the
sun to allow energy to pass
through. One small drawback
to this effect is a 2% loss
in efficiency compared to
standard solar panels. None-
theless, Mr. Musk stated that
he will be investing over $3
million to maximize energy
absorption.
During the launch, it was
announced that the tiles will
be released in four distinct
styles – Tuscan, Slate, Tex-
tured and Smooth – a brilliant
decision that will appeal to
a wide range of consumers.
These slick slates are made
from tempered quartz glass,
providing them with higher
durability than standard
asphalt and giving them a
lifespan of at least 50 years,
compared to 20. Musk also
claims they will have the
capacity to defrost themselves
with specialized heating ele-
ments, similar to those in cars.
Despite how exciting this
announcement has been
for most of the world, some
remain skeptical of their
accessibility to middle class
homes because, oddly
enough, actual prices of
producing and installing the
tiles remains a mystery. None-
theless, Musk stated that the
cost will be lower than current
roof and electricity expenses.
Installments are scheduled
to begin next summer in
California, with two versions
available. Purchasing this
system will include a newly
developed integrated home
battery to serve as a back
up, storing enough energy to
power a four-bedroom house
for a day.
There is no doubt that
the potential low cost and
practicality of these new solar
panels are two of the main
aspects making it attractive
to homeowners. But, the most
important and obvious reason
to purchase them is that they
use clean, sustainable energy.
The use of fossil fuels is still a
severe problem globally, and
it is worth stressing we are all
both the creators and victims
of the repercussions they are
having on the environment.

n spite of the seemingly
everlasting state of
conflict in the international
community, all countries
have pretty much agreed
to pretend to be friends in
outer space.
The UN Outer Space Treaty,
adopted unanimously in
1963, outlined the ground
rules for outer space use
and exploration, including
fluffy clauses on helping
any astronauts in trouble,
irrespective of their country
of origin, and keeping all
parts of outer space freely
accessible to all states (i.e.
not invading space to become
the Emperor of the Universe).
The treaty also prohibited
placing nuclear weapons or
weapons of mass destruc-
tion on celestial bodies, in
Earth’s orbit or anywhere
else in outer space, which
is why we can be relatively
certain that the moon will
still be there when we wake
up tomorrow. Other types of
weapons, however, did not
get a mention in that treaty
or in any of the following UN
space law agreements, so if
somebody attempted a kinetic
orbital strike from the Earth’s
orbit and flung a projectile
at whatever country they’re
having relationship issues
with at the moment, the act
would technically be legal
as far as space law is con-
cerned. While this may seem
alarming, us humans already
have so many other of ways
we could perish as a species
that this little issue is but a
single star in our increasingly
perilous universe.
F
act: blind people
don’t see darkness.
They see nothing.
I’ll admit this seems
counter-intuitive;
most of us would
shout “I can’t see anything”
when stumbling around in the
pitch-dark. But understanding
blindness requires a bit more
thought.
It does depend on the
type of blindness. Acquired
blindness seems to leave
patients with light rather than
darkness: imagine a speaker
with an unplugged Aux cable
– you’ve heard that buzzing
noise? If your optic nerve is
severed, random signals are
generated in much the same
way, resulting in constant
random dancing patterns of
light. And of course, closing
your eyes won’t make them
go away, so darkness is in
fact the one thing you never
see.
If you are born blind
though, the issue is a little
different. With no concept of
sight, individuals born blind
lack a perception of light and
darkness in the same way
as humans lack a perception
of magnetic fields, or the 5th
dimension. It’s not ‘darkness’
in the way we might imagine;
the best way to understand
it is to ask yourself what you
can ‘see’ behind you right
now. We don’t see a large
black blob everywhere out-
side our field of vision – we
see nothing, and that’s just
normal.
It’s probably different for
each person who experiences
blindness, but safe to say its a
little different to putting on a
blindfold.

Another setback for the quest of finding a reliable male contraceptive, with reports of side
effects in clinical trials causing concern

Can, isn’t it about
time for a bit of
equality when
it comes to birth
control? Men currently only
have 3 options: condoms,
vasectomies and withdrawal
(not recommended),
compared to the multiple
women can choose from.
Unfortunately, side effects
are common alongside
hormonal contraception
methods resulting in mood
swings, depression, weight
gain, acne, or heavy periods.
Having a male equivalent is a
more balanced compromise,
but would also allow men to
take control of their fertility,
making it more of a two-way
street. A report showed that
over half of women forgot to
take at least one Pill during
their last cycle. Yikes.
A recent study has been
published that has found
hormone injections in males to
be 96% efficient in stopping
effects and increase efficiency
from 96% up to the female
equivalent of 99.9%. It’s
also quite annoying, with the
men having to return to the
clinic for injections every few
weeks.
But good news! There’s
another male nonw-hormo-
nal contraceptive to watch
out for which may be even
more exciting. ‘Vasalgel’ is
estimated to hit the US drug
market by 2020. Just like
the implant for girls, it only
involves one injection and
could last for years. It works
as a temporary vasectomy,
with a polymer that blocks
sperm from getting through
the sperm tubes. It can then
be reversed by a second
injection that dissolves the
polymer, letting the sperm
swim free. So fear not! It
may not immediate, but male
contraception is coming soon.
Pun intended.

However, 20 out of the 320
participants had to drop out
due to “adverse side effects”.
These included depression,
pain at the injection site,
increased libido and acne.
Despite these few, the major-
ity of other participants only
suffered mild effects, and
75% said that they wouldn’t
mind continuing this method
of contraception at the end of
the trial.
You may have seen reports
that this avenue of contra-
ception has been dismissed
due to side effects that sound
pretty similar to those already
experienced by women on
hormonal contraception.
Quite rightly, this annoyed
a lot of people who claimed
that this is a bit unfair, but
it seems this isn’t the only
reason. The method itself

Veganism is probably
one of the most
contentious topics
of our time. Though
I am not fully vegan due to
personal reasons, I joined
VegSoc because, after
watching documentaries
like Cowspiracy and Food
Matters, anyone would be
hard-pressed to lay off meat
slightly. I think it’s time we
appreciate the ups and downs
of veganism, as contrary to
popular belief, vegans aren’t
the angry meat prosecutors
most people think they are.
The argument is two-
sided: some claim veganism
prolongs health, others
experience a physical decline
after the switch. Of course,
science can help to explain
why some people fare worse
most think, Vitamin A, which
promotes good vision and
immune response, is not
present in its active form in
plants (whereas it is in animal
products). The veggie form
must then be converted by a
special enzyme in order to be
used by the body. Those with
lower levels of this enzyme
(around 45% of us), have
difficulty getting enough Vita-
min A from plants alone. Low
thyroid function and poor gut
health only exacerbate this
condition.
3. Starch tolerance. Most
vegans will have to compen-
sate for lower meat levels
with more carbohydrates,
but again, this depends on
one’s ability to process all
that starch. We all need an
enzyme called alpha-amylase
to break down starch, how-
ever those historically more
inclined to eating starch, such
as Japanese or Southeast
Asians, have more copies of
the alpha-amylase gene. For
those with low starch toler-
ance, sudden carb influx will
lead to shaky blood sugar
levels and possibly weight
gain.
So what are we supposed to
do with all this information?
Trial and error is probably
our best bet. With the right
microbes and genes, a vegan
diet supplemented with Vita-
min B12 can do wonders, but
it’s up to you to listen to your
body.

than others. Here are a few
key reasons for differing
responses:
1. It’s your gut’s fault.
To sum it up, some gut
microbiomes are more
veggie-friendly than others.
Important bacterial commu-
nities synthesise Vitamin K2,
which is needed for skeletal
health and to maintain insulin
levels. Alongside this, K2 is
found almost exclusively in
animal products. So, if some-
one’s microbiome is lacking
these bacteria, without animal
products K2 levels will drop,
leading to increased risk of
fractures and other horrid
stuff like cardiovascular
disease.
2. Vitamin A. Unlike what
