A Pacifist’s
Guide to the
War on Cancer
B
ryony Kimmings’
latest project
might be her
most ambitious.
A Pacifist’s Guide
to the War on
Cancer is a poignant
portrayal of life alongside
cancer, experienced
through the naïve eyes of
a mother whose baby boy
is diagnosed. This sombre
premise is transformed with
all Kimmings’ charm and
idiosyncrasy into a musical,
ablaze with physical theatre,
acerbic dialogue, and
songs such as Even Cunts
get Cancer, Fuck This, and
MRI RnB. The impressive
part of this production is
it manages to do all this
without becoming crass
or disrespectful. In fact,
throughout the pantomime a
serious point is being raised:
cancer is shit and those that
suffer shouldn’t be expected
to become paragons of
positivity – they are as human
as everyone else. The best
those of us who still live in ‘the
kingdom of the well’ can do is
to recognise this.
This production is successful
precisely because it makes
this humanity relevant. The
final scene is intimate and
bold, calling forth both actors
and audience to share their
experiences with cancer.
Kimmings wrote the play,
in part, because of her own
experience with a seriously
ill son; the characters are
all based on real figures
Kimmings encountered in
her experience in hospitals
and with cancer patients. At
its most emotive, the actors
intersperse dialogue with real
recordings of the cancer suf-
ferers they are representing.
The research is immaculate
Ezra Kitson
and the performances deeply
evocative.
But I don’t love this piece,
and I came out of the theatre
frustrated by a terrific idea
executed sloppily. This is not
to say the production isn’t
good – far from it. The set
design is eerie and atmos-
pheric: a hospital ward with
seven exits. The choreog-
raphy is slick and the band
flawlessly moves through an
eclectic range of styles. The
casting is well done, and
on stage the actors form
a motley crew of patients
and doctors that is visually
pleasing, helped by superb
costume design throughout. I
was especially impressed by
the colourful tumour costumes
that are surprisingly beautiful
(and, to my limited knowledge
of cancer biology, surprisingly
accurate).
The songs themselves are
the play’s undoing: for the
most part they are tawdry
and forgettable. This is
particularly true in the dull
melody of Fingers Crossed,
which returns as a motif
throughout the play. Perhaps
this wouldn’t be as much of
a problem if the singing was
good, but unfortunately some
of the cast were continually
sharp and their voices were

A
s I walked
into Somerset
House from the
increasingly
bitter streets
surrounding
the Strand, I was greeted
by the world of fashion,
along with a flock of fashion
students. I was at the brand
new exhibitIion, Hair by Sam
McKnight, designed to mimic
both the feel of a catwalk
and an editorial photoshoot.
I wasn’t sure what to expect
from a collection solely
centred on hair – after all, it
only takes up a small part of
our bodies, how influential
could it be? Well, if you want
to find out just how much hair
shaped the world, then this is
the exhibition for you.
Sam McKnight is one of
the most famous hair stylists
of this generation, having
styled the glossy locks of Kate
Moss, Princess Diana, Tilda
Swinton, and Lady Gaga –
to name but a few. Having
helped style the iconic looks
behind Vivienne Westwood’s
eclectic collections, as well
as keeping things classy for
Chanel, McKnight has been
in the forefront of the fashion
scene since the 1970s, and
continues to reign supreme.
The exhibition celebrates “40
years of fashion’s most iconic
hairstyles”, and it was only
from seeing this that I realised
how versatile our keratin
strands really are: McKnight
sees hair as a material that
can be harnessed, regrown,
shaped, or coloured into
almost anything imaginable.
He’s famous for the ‘pouf’ and
the ‘done-undone’ looks, and
he coined a technique that
can turn any hair type into
an afro (I’ll be trying it later).
His career speaks for itself,
with the walls of the exhibit
lined with Vogue covers and
editorial shoots he styled for,
as well as personal polaroids
of him with notoriously
famous fashion faces.
The exhibit itself has ups
and downs, but overall does
a great job of showcasing
the work and life behind
McKnight himself. A highlight
for me was a room filled
with larger than life edito-
rial pieces of models with
completely different looks,
all of which were stunningly
unique and beautiful. Smaller
rooms focused on certain
designers or iconic people,
most notably Princess Diana,
who allowed McKnight to
radically cut her hair, giving
her the image she is remem-
bered by today. Some parts
of the exhibition fell a bit
flat, with random wigs and
pieces of multi-coloured hair
giving little added meaning
to what was going on, and
some rooms weren’t very
captivating – but I suppose
it depends on your relative
interest in fashion. I did wish
there was a bit more on the
actual process of hair styling,
as well as documenting
McKnight’s life in more detail;
a little bit of history regarding
certain hairstyles wouldn’t
have gone amiss! But then
again, it’s not the V&A, and
Somerset House is known for
keeping things contemporary
and fresh.
Overall I think this exhibit is
worth seeing, not only from a
fashion perspective, but also
for the photography aspect.
Going through the exhibition,
I learned that I can afford to
make far bolder choices when
it comes to hairstyling. I think
I’ll leave the buzzcut for now
though...

halting and unassured. I con-
sidered leaving this criticism
out – after all am I not missing
the point slightly? The actors
are playing real people, and
their voices are accordingly
sincere and human. Perhaps,
but the arrangements were
entirely wrong for this sort of
singing; they required trained
and powerful voices, the
kind that only actress Naana
Agyei-Ampdau possessed.
Another issue is the nar-
ration Kimmings provides. I
understand the need for a
narrator in this play, espe-
cially after the denouement
where the fourth wall is
entirely broken and no one
seems to know how to con-
tinue. Kimmings doesn’t do a
bad job either; the narration
paces the play well and I
liked the dialogue between
characters and narrator.
At the same time, I have no
empathy for Kimmings as she
narrates. She researched the
play, yes, and undoubtedly
has been affected by cancer
as almost all of us have, but
hers is the voice of a proud
writer and it does nothing to
elicit an emotional response.
It would have been far more
powerful if one of the cancer
patients upon whom the
characters are based had
recorded the voice over.
Finally as the older critic
sat next to me remarked, the
play is heavily focused on
millennials. “We don’t talk
enough talk about cancer”
the narration begins. My
neighbour scoffed – given
how many people she knew
with the disease I’m sure this
felt entirely misplaced.
A Pacifist’s Guide to the
War on Cancer achieves
what it sets out to do: it makes
cancer human and it makes
it intimate. It’s just a shame
that the powerful aspects of
this piece clash against its
theatricality. Given a re-draft
and a change to the song list,
this could easily be a five star
performance.
