CANCER
VIRGO
This week no matter
how much you shower
you can’t wash away the
shame from the things
you did while drunk
on Halloween. Or the
fake blood. Or the real
blood.

This week you’re
Brexit. You’re having
an identity crisis.
After the high court
ruling does Brexit
really mean Brexit?
Who are you? You
take a gap yah
round Europe to find
out.
This week you
remember that you have
so much chocolate that
you should give some
away. Your invitation for
children to come back to
your house for sweeties
is not appreciated
however. Halloween
was last week.
This week you
couldn’t care less who
wins the US election,
you’re still up in arms
about the price rises
of drinks in the union.
£2.70 for a Stella.
Fuck. Freddos used
to be 10p as well.
Cameron’s Britain.
This week you tried out
for University Challenge
in order to fulfil your
dream of becoming a
BNOC. You fail miserably
and don’t make it past the
first round. Guess you’re
going to have to kill Ben
Fernando to take his
crown.
This week you
undertake a Media
Law course and come
out feeling much better
about your paper. Turns
out if you accidentally
libel someone all you
have to do is murder
them. The dead can’t
sue.
This week just to make
sure you don’t offend
anyone you wear
poppies head to toe. The
appeal of all that floral
dress attracts a swarm
of genital stinging bees
(these exist) and you have
to bathe in sudocrem for
several days.
This week you are
over smoking the devil’s
lettuce and want to
make edibles but in halls
that’s easier said than
done. You then have the
sudden realisation that
the only solution left is
to stick it up your bum. I
heard this works.
This week you’re
the only person who
was outraged by
the #FreeTheNipple
centrefold. Shame, we
had a national media
press response ready
and waiting to go and
everything.
This week you
are inspired by the
Trainspotting sequel
film trailer. Choose a
degree. Choose the
4th
floor of the library.
Choose not seeing
daylight between
November and January.
Choose Imperial.
This week you are left
home alone on sports night
as you, well, you don’t
do any sports so nobody
invites you anywhere. You
look around your house
in your loneliness and find
only a pumpkin, but one
with a suitably sized hole…
This week you
decided to give
watersports a go after
seeing a felix ad. You
show up at the venue
but are confused by
the lack of facilitites.
Instead everything is
covered in cling film.
Oh.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I hope you don’t mind me writing to you from across the
pond. I don’t know what to do – I’m surrounded by Trump
supporters! My friends and family all want to ‘make Amer-
ica great again’. Since they’ve followed Trump’s interviews
and rallies, I’ve had to deal with my roommates blaming
everything from our leaky roof to our broken boiler on our
Mexican neighbours from across the street. It’s embarrass-
ing. Everything is so nonsensical I just don’t know where
to start. I can’t even reason with them; I find it impossible
to participate in a debate where the person I’m talking to
changes their mind about what their point was every five
minutes. It’s even destroying my relationship - I can’t sleep
with my girlfriend knowing that he also wants to fuck over
the country.
Yours,
Cint
Hey Clint!
Hmm, I think you’re going about this the wrong
way. You have clearly found yourself in a
situation where your opinions are different to
those around you. Perhaps your life would be
easier if you found a way to agree with your
friends and family? Maybe you should take
more time to try to understand Trump’s appeal.
Staying true to yourself is overrated and not
much fun, so instead of sticking up for what
you believe in, just give over and give up! Your
identity should be malleable to whoever is
around you. That’s why it’s called a personal-
ity; It’s personalised to every individual you
interact with. There’s no point trying to accept
your differences and move on. You must eradi-
cate them for every human, ever.
HOROSCOPES
Life is about compromises (of your whole self).
If you really, really can’t shake the unnecessary
idea of being ‘yourself’, I guess your only other
option is to become a total recluse, or find
a whole host of new friends and family that
agree with you about everything. The people
you surround yourself should be an echo
chamber of your own views. If a conversation
isn’t a game of parroting back to one another,
you’re doing it wrong! Same goes for your
social media timelines: if you see anything you
dislike, ever, just unfriend! That’s why there’s
no dislike button – just delete everything you
wouldn’t say yourself.
I hope you don’t mind me writing to you from
across the pond.
Much love
Chris xxxxx
