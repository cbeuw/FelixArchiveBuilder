L
ast week at Council, a
report from the Deputy
President (Welfare)
revealed that she had
successfully secured
£5000 from College
for a one-year subscription
to Consent Matters, an
online educational tool to be
integrated with Blackboard
that supposes to inform
students about “sex, consent,
and relationships”. Consent
Matters is a 2 hour course
that, from the preview on
their website, appears to be
composed entirely of stick-
figure animations with a
narration so mind-numbingly
patronising that the viewer
regresses into a child-like
state as they’re taught the
thoroughly novel lesson that
‘sometimes touching people’s
no-no parts is bad’.
were never presented with
a cartoon telling them that
you shouldn’t have sex with
unconscious people is utterly
delusional. The only people
who will go to the trouble of
taking this course are those
who already value learning
about consent. Anyone who
is forced to take the course
for disciplinary reasons (as
suggested by the DPW at
Council) will also extract zero
benefit as they have already
shown a wilful disregard for
others’ ownership of their own
bodies that an hour of cheery
narration cannot fix (although
perhaps the soul-destroying
boredom of the experience
will be a well-deserved
punishment). In short, this
purchase will contribute
nothing to the student
experience on campus.
Despite this, our elected
representatives saw fit to have
£5,000 of College money put
towards this purchase. That’s
5/9 of annual tuition for most
of you, or just enough for a
brand new reception desk in
the Union. That’s many times
larger than the RCSU’s entire
Welfare budget. Imagine
what could have been done
with it had it been secured for
funding clubs and societies,
or for Constituent Unions to
spend on real, meaningful
contributions to student
welfare. This is £5,000
completely and utterly wasted.
It is true that the engagement
of the student body with Union
Council is essentially nil (heck,
most of those with a seat on
Council don’t show up most
of the time). Because of this,
Union staff and sabbatical
officers (who, as this incident
shows, can be just as out-of-
publication embarrassing to
a Union Officer, the highest
purpose of a Student Union
– to stand up for its members
against the University – was
completely perverted. These
things can happen because
staff are only accountable
to us through the sabbatical
officers, who themselves are
only accountable through
Council, in which the majority
of us do not engage.
If we, as students and
members of Imperial College
Union, do not make our voices
heard, this will only continue.
As the accountability of
the Union to its members
evaporates, it can only
become less and less student-
focused and more and more
of a ‘Student Appeasement
Division’ of Imperial College
London. If you have an opinion
on any of the vast number
of issues that affect us all as
students, Union Council is the
place for it to be heard. Get

degree of accountability that
is vastly insufficient. Thanks to
the Union’s decision to make
their Governance Manager
redundant over the summer,
the latest set of elections
were completely ballsed up
and the resulting shockingly
low voter turnout strikes at
the heart of our very nature
as a democratic Student
Union. Because of the Union’s

’m an idiot.
Thisisthefirstpresidential
election I can vote in, and
it appears that unless I pay
a huge amount of money
to ship my absentee ballot
over to Pennsylvania, my voice
won’t be heard.
And even with that being
said, my vote definitely
wouldn’t have mattered,
seeing as it would have been
for Jill Stein.
I’ve received a lot of criticism
for this decision. Basically, “A
vote for anyone but Hillary
Clinton is a vote for Donald
Trump”, and at least from a
mathematical standpoint, it’s a
difficult point to argue against.
While it’s difficult to like
either any of the mainstream
candidates, the most damning
observation I’ve made while
witnessing this election is the
amount of people on both
sides who have disregarded
logical arguments for the sake
for supporting their preferred
candidate.
It’s the type of loyalty you
see in sports fans supporting
their teams on and off the
field. The problem is we’re
not talking about games here.
We’re talking about real issues
in one of the most powerful
countries in the world, and
how we should try and solve
them.
Let’s rewind to the candidate
I chose: Jill Stein. I actually
witnessed Stein at the DNC
when I covered it for the
Philadelphia Inquirer and
Daily News back in June.
First, I’ll establish the fact that
by ruling out the Donald and
the Hilldog, that leaves Stein,
the Green Party candidate,
and Libertarian Party
candidate Gary Johnson. Both
have a lot of strengths, but I
lean towards Stein because of
some radical changes Johnson
proposes, including abolishing
the Internal Revenue Service,
eliminating corporation taxes
and ending the Department of
Education.
The problem with voting for
one of these candidates is that
there are considerable flaws
in both, which was nicely
highlighted in John Oliver’s
Last Week Tonight in October.
Johnson, when asked by a
reporter, couldn’t name a
foreign world leader off the
top of his head. Stein thinks
that when the government
bailed out Wall Street, that it
was done through a “magic
trick” known as quantitative
easing. News flash: that easing
isn’t a trick, it’s actually an
advanced monetary tool that
has been extensively studied
in the world of academia.
And yet, they both seem
like much better options than
what the Democratic and
Republican parties have
produced. Both Johnson and
Stein agree that marijuana
should be legalised. In
America, that drug is currently
classified as Schedule I. In
other words, it’s somehow as
dangerous as heroin.
They also believe in prison
reform and police brutality as
severe issues, at a time where
those topics have generated a
lot of news and debate in the
states.
It’s been very interesting to
witness this election season
from over 3000 miles away,
and I’ve been pleasantly
surprised at how informed
British people are about it. But
as my professor here has told
us, the United States impacts
Europe severely, especially
economically.
I’ve tried to make sense of
how so many of my people
in my country could gravitate
towardstwoofthemostdisliked
presidential candidates in
the United States’ history.
On the one hand, Trump is
certainly not a politician,
and he definitely fits the anti-
establishment bill well. Clinton
has more than three decades
of experience in the political
field, and has accomplished
several objectives while in her
numerous positions.
But here’s the issue: Trump
has committed a laundry list of
actions during his campaign
that make him look like not
only an idiot, but also a man
who should not have the
responsibility of being one of
the most powerful politicians
in the world. With Clinton,
there’s so much secrecy and
suspicious activity during her
time as a politician – most
recently in this email scandal
that has just reappeared in the
news – that electing her would
essentially just be a vote for a
‘big political machine’, for lack
of a better term.
But here are my two options:
a candidate who certainly
has the experience, but has
also partaken in a lot of
suspicious activity throughout
her political career. The
other option is a man who
apparently thinks talking
about sexually assaulting
women is just “locker room
talk” and then claims that
“no one has more respect for
women” than him.
I’m not a smart guy. We
established that in the first
three words of this piece. But
I am smart enough to think
for myself. Perhaps more
importantly, I am willing to
debate my opinions with other
people who disagree, without
taking the attacks against my
ideas so personally.
But to hundreds of thousands
of people in my country voting
for Clinton or Trump, I see this
political season developing
like a heated sports rivalry.
The problem is this is politics,
not sports. And politics is too
important to be like sports.
