Being an
immigrant in the
UK isn’t all doom
and gloom
Aayush Singh responds to Lef’s
article on immigration
I
n response to the article from Friday,
the 14th
of October, I never knew
how hard it was being an immigrant
until I put it into words, I would like
to propose an alternative view and
my own personal take on life as an
immigrant in Britain.
Last week’s article spoke about how
being an immigrant is never fun and
because of Brexit it really sucks right now.
However, speaking as an immigrant who
immigrated here as a pre-teen, I struggled
It’s my party
and I’ll cry if
I want to
Lef Apostolakis responds to
Aayush’s response (left)
to understand its point of view.
Unlike the author, it was never my
decision to move to the UK. Although it
was challenging, I’m happy to say that I’ve
had a smooth transition, primarily due to
the UK’s hospitable nature. Having made
the decision to come to the UK out of one’s
own volition, it is unfair to state that one
has had to make the UK their home as if
one has been forced into the decision.
In reality, the author chose to study in a
country that he claims to dislike so much.
Although the article talks about the
chauvinistic rhetoric and the jingoism that
Britain portrays, I personally find Britain
to be an extremely accommodating and
multicultural country. My father came
to this country as a skilled worker and I
vehemently disagree that the UK seeks
to bar foreign expertise. In addition, the
deportation of EU citizens was brought up.
This is something that has not be ratified
at either table making these statements
careless scaremongering. Even if a deal
had been reached, it would have to be
mutually beneficial.
D
uring this conversation we
have touched upon two
topics, each with its own
complexities, each in need
of far more discussion than
allowed in a couple of pages.
One is the difficulties associated with
immigration, the other one is the tensions
that Brexit has intensified.
Starting with immigration: it is a difficult
process. Whether voluntary or not, it
involves abandoning a life and building a
new one someplace else. Of course it’s not
all bad, or bad at all for many migrants,
yet it remains difficult. But since I’ve left
home I realised I’ll never be happy in any
one place ever again. There will always
be something missing, whether that’s the
Greek food and hospitality, or the English
efficiency and organisation. And then
there’s also those things I don’t think I
could ever go back to.
So yes, we migrate “out of our own
volition”. So what? Does making this
S
V
In the time I’ve been here, I
have felt nothing but welcome
and have never really
experienced discrimination
of any form from the British
people or system. This is not
to say that I haven’t come
across bigoted ‘douchebags’
of all nationalities but this,
unfortunately, is a part of life
as people fall in all parts of the
spectrum. Instead, I feel I have
been presented with many
opportunities that I would
not have received elsewhere.
The article has generalised
the entire population based
on a few encounters and thus
insulted many who are more
than welcoming.
I am not trying to devalue
the opinions or personal
experiences of the article’s
author but I feel the
generalisation of the anti-
immigrant view of the British
people is more few-and-far-
between than the article leads
people to believe.
decision disqualify us from ever discussing
it again? Should we just shut up and
keep our chin up in fear of being called
ungrateful? I think not. No one knows the
choices we’ve had to make. You make it
sound like we came to your home uninvited,
ate your food and spat it out with disdain.
But in reality we came to an overpriced,
overhypedrestaurant.Icametostudyinthe
UK but let’s not fool ourselves, everything I
got from this country, education included, I
either earned or paid for.
Now regardless of our contrasting
feelings on immigration, one thing is
undeniable, the climate in the UK has
definitely changed post-Brexit.
During the two weeks before
and after the referendum,
reported hate crimes
increased by 41% according
to figures released by the
Home Office. The government
keeps attacking foreign
doctors, students and even
taxi drivers: particularly when
it comes down to Europeans
in the UK – immigrants with a
particularly privileged status
in this county. Although no
one has straight-up said that
there will be deportations,
the absence of guarantees
is stressful. I, for one, do not
appreciate my livelihood
being dangled like a carrot in
front of the EU.
The point I was trying to
make was that emigration is
not easy. It takes a toll on you.
It’s usually the better option
and can in fact be pleasant
and lead to a fulfilling life (it
often does, which is why we’ve
been doing it since prehistory).
But that doesn’t ever make it
an easy process, and Brexit
really hasn’t helped.

T
here are a lot
of things that
Imperial girls
can do, including
studying science
and engineering,
leading clubs and societies,
and, presumably, going
through adolescence,
meaning that by the time we’re
at Imperial, we’re probably
women, not girls. But one area
where we seem to be lacking,
according to Sport Imperial, is
in our ability to engage in any
sporting activities.
At first glance, it’s wonderful
that Sport Imperial have taken
up the national ‘This Girl
Can’ campaign to encourage
women in sport. The campaign
celebrates women doing
sport because it makes them
feel good, regardless of their
skill level or whether it, god
forbid, makes their hair stick
to their sweaty forehead.
Yes, I still hate that the name
reduces women to ‘silly little
girls’, but on the whole, it does
good work. This campaign is
sadly necessary, as so many
women are discouraged
from sports because all too
often exercising is seen as
something that a woman can
only do in public if she is long,
lean, and lithe – after all,
you’re embarrassing yourself
if your belly jiggles as you
finish that 10k run. As well as
uplifting women, This Girl Can
reminds us that women do
sport for reasons that aren’t
calorie burning or weight loss.
Unfortunately, in trying to
bring this to Imperial, Sport
Imperial have seriously
misplaced the message.
Two years in a row, they have
created a campaign which
only perpetrates the idea
that women’s sport is inferior
to men’s, and does nothing
whatsoever to encourage
women’s sport.
Following a disastrous
2015 Varsity, where, for the
first time, a women’s sport
was billed as the headline
match, only for the female
participants to be refused the
perks given to the men, the
spectators to be prevented
from watching the match,
and the players to be subject
to sexist abuse as they were
stranded at the venue, Sport
Imperial needed to get their
act together on their attitude
towards women’s sport. It was
a case of a great intention
being horribly diverted
because a strong undercurrent
of sexism prevented it from
being anything other than
just a publicity stunt. This has
happened again with Imperial
Girls Can.
Maybe Imperial Girls
Can would be successful at
encouraging women into sport
if they actually thought to tell
women about it. A facebook
event shared very sparingly
amongst those who already
like and engage with the Sport
Imperial page is not sufficient
advertising. Even for those
of us who already take part
in Sport Imperial sanctioned
activities, whose Wednesday
BUCSmatchwasappropriated
as part of this event, were
barely made aware of what
was happening.
And let’s talk about the bright
pink advertising, for the few
people who saw it. I’m told that
the colour was chosen in line
with the national campaign
(that I’m pretty sure is not
entirely pink, but whatever
helps you sleep at night, Sport
Imperial), but if they’re so
obsessed with branding, why
go off-brand with a childish
font presumably chosen to
appeal to our unsophisticated
brains? Maybe that’s why
they advertised several of the
events with images of men –
true athletes – to inspire us.
And don’t forget, ladies, that
these classes are a great way
to burn calories. And burn
calories we shall, only taking
part in gimmicky sessions like
Zombie Zumba and Spooky
Spin. Forget sports, Sport
Imperial thinks that the only
reason women exercise is for
their personal fitness, rather
than because of a passion for
an activity.
Curiously, two years in
a row, Imperial Girls Can
has also served to create a
systematic discrimination on
behalf of the Union. Every
week, the Union minibuses
are overbooked, and they’re
allocated to those travelling
the furthest distance. With the
Imperial Girls Can matches
being moved to Heston, the
(incrementally) nearest of the
sportsgrounds, this means
that on the day meant to be
celebrating their sport, the
women are denied access to a
facility that they would have,
had Sport Imperial not been
throwing this event. This was
raised as a problem last year
but occurred in exactly the
same way on Wednesday, as
those forced to participate in
this event are clearly only an
afterthought in the planning.
I love a free t-shirt and cup
of hot chocolate, and it’s great
for so many athletic women to
get together and be inspired
by each other. But we are
women already very invested
in our sport – we’ve already
\\ A strong

had to learn not to care about
how our sport is perceived. It
does nothing to encourage the
women who struggle to get
into sport, and is patronising at
best to those who are. At least
this year they dropped the free
gift to women’s rugby of non-
contact mouthguards. Despite
Sport Imperial handling our
fixtures, they don’t seem to
have got the memo that we
play full contact rugby. After
all, we’re girls.
Within women’s sports,
these sexist attitudes create
a hierarchy of what is most
entertaining, or ‘worthwhile’
as compared to the men’s
game. I’ve heard again and
again that women’s rugby
should not expect to receive
the same treatment as men’s
rugby as we simply don’t
play to the same level as the
men’s first XV. Forget that we
train as hard as the men and
play exactly the same game,
the fact that most of us didn’t
have the opportunity to have
ten years of training before
arriving at university is what
we should be judged by.
Imperial Girls Can is just
Sport Imperial patting women
on the back for the adorable
act of attempting to partake
in activity, rather than
encouraging serious women’s
sport. Of course, this is done
only with the caveat that they
remember that they’re there
to entertain, and don’t delude
themselves into thinking that
their sporting performance
is remotely equivalent to the
men’s.
