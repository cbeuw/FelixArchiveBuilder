As the American election looms,
the discourse has gotten more
and more sordid. ‘What do we
mean when we call someone
a “nasty woman”?’ asks Fred
Fyles, who turns to the silver
screen for answers, looking at
the archetypical ‘nasty women’
of cinema
O
n the evening
of the 19th
October, at
the University
of Nevada’s
Las Vegas
campus, the phrase ‘nasty
woman’ entered the internet’s
lexicon. These words were
uttered by Donald Trump
towards the end of the third
and final election debate,
in a contest that has been
defined by mud-slinging,
press-madness, and all-round
feelings of dread. While
answering a question about
tax increases for the wealthy,
Hillary Clinton made a jab
about Trump’s likely tax
evasion; half way through her
answer, Trump leaned into the
microphone, and pointedly
said the words ‘such a nasty
woman’, closely followed by
‘your husband disagrees with
you’.
While many may pale at
the idea of another Clinton
presidency – both liberals
and conservatives alike –
this seemed to be a new
low for Trump. In one fell
swoop, Trump had defined
Clinton, who was Secretary
of State for four years, as her
husband’s subject, and alien-
ated many women voters.
Seemingly instantaneously,
products sprung up across the
web: nasty woman t-shirts,
badges, and Halloween cos-
tumes emerged overnight, to
complete any liberal feminist’s
outfit. But what do we mean
when we say ‘nasty woman’?
The term ‘nasty’, while
technically genderless, to me
always seems to be applied
more often to women than
men – why is this? As usual,
I took to the silver screen to
try and answer my questions
for me.
For me, when someone uses
the epithet ‘nasty woman’, it
comes from a place of deep
insecurity, from a fear of an
inversion of the traditional
patriarchal power structures
in society. As such, when
thinking about the role ‘nasty
women’ play in cinema, the
first film that springs to mind is
the 1954 Nicholas Ray classic
Johnny Guitar, a techni-
colour fever dream of a
Western. Despite being
named after the gun-
slinger, Johnny Guitar
actually centres around
Vienna (Joan Craw-
ford), a saloonkeeper in
high-waisted trousers who
maintains a difficult relation-
ship with the townspeople.
As Michael Newton writes,
Johnny Guitar ‘operates at an
uncomfortable pitch of excess
and emotional extremity’.
Vienna, with her self-owned
business, and a plot of land
that stands to become a lot
more valuable when the
railroad is laid down, has eco-
nomic power over the men in
her life, and is able to maintain
a fierce independence. She is
under the bus to get what
she wants. Priestly doesn’t
necessarily have economic
power over others (although
she is very wealthy), rather
her power is more cultural –
she is a tastemaker, one who
can see through the cogs
and labyrinth of the fashion
industry to explain why that
certain shade of cerulean has
become so popular. While
the film doesn’t explicitly
touch on it, it’s not difficult
to see the difference in per-
ception between Priestly and
Gordon Gecko, the broker
at the centre of the 1987 film
Wall Street: while Priestly is
a ‘nasty woman’, Gecko is
– like Leonardo DiCaprio’s
character in The Wolf of
Wall Street – more of
an antihero, someone
we root for despite our-
selves. Despite having
similar characters, the
way we empathise
with these characters
is resoundly different,
something that is difficult to
separate from their gender.
Similarly, in Michael
Clayton, the 2007 thriller,
Tilda Swinton plays Karen
Crowder, the general counsel
of an agricultural products
conglomerate, analogous
to Monsanto. Crowder’s
company is represented
by a prestigious law firm,
for whom Michael Clayton
(George Clooney) acts as a
‘fixer’; things turn awry when
In defence of ‘nasty women’
nobody’s fool, and takes no
prisoners, refusing to succumb
to sentimentalism – as such she
is one incarnation of the ‘nasty
woman’.
But the power dynamic can
manifest itself in different
ways. In The Devil Wears
Prada, Meryl Streep plays
Miranda Priestly, the editor of
Runway, and a thinly-veiled
representation of Vogue
editor Anna Wintour. Priestly
is an arch-bitch, known for
her chilly nature, and exces-
sive demands on her personal
Clayton happens across a
document obtained by his
dead colleague, which shows
the company manufactured
a weed killer they knew was
carcinogenic. As she tries
to cover up her company’s
reputation, Crowder resorts
to more desperate measures,
including fraud and murder.
Swinton earned an Oscar
for her portrayal, which was
full of nuance and sympathy
– even though Crowder was
the complete villain of the
film, Swinton still managed to
find space to build up a fully
realised character, showing
us that the ‘nasty woman’
label is one that (even if it is
applicable) reduces a woman
down to a single character-
istic, and refuses to allow for
any measure of depth.
The closest comparison
to Clinton, and possibly the
nearest thing cinema has
to the archetypical political
‘nasty woman’, can be found
in the character of Tracy
Flick from Alexander Payne’s
seminal 1999 film Election.
Starring Reese Witherspoon
as Tracy, Election centres
around a Nebraskan high
school’s student body
election, and the trials and
tribulations it brings. Tracy
is the brightest student in the
school, with an insufferable
air of self-importance, and
a desire to get herself on as
many committees as possible;
she’s got an overbearing
secretary Andrea (Anne
Hathaway); although the film
attempts to let us see a softer
side of Priestly, we are left
with no doubts about what
kind of person she is – one
who is willing to throw others

The new film by the French-
Canadian auteuer at the top of
his game arrives at cinemas next
Friday
H
ugh Jackman
–was it as scary
to work with
him in Prisoners
as it looked?
What the
were all the spiders about
in Enemy? And how the hell
do you pronounce that last
name?! There are many
questions we’d love to ask
Denis Villeneuve, the man
who’s gone from abduction
drama to existential horror to
war-crime thriller to thought-
provoking sci-fi - all in the
space of the last three years.
Sadly, he’s a little busy at the
moment, so he wasn’t around
to answer them. But, with his
latest feature Arrival being
released in the UK next week,
we figured we had enough
of a reason to nerd out over
him and his work anyway.
Here is a short profile of the
man and his filmography;
a three-time winner of the
Academy of Canadian
Cinema and Television Best
Film award and Genie Award
for Best Direction, future
director of the sequel to the
science fiction classic Blade
Runner, and all-round great
filmmaker.
Early Career
Born in Gentilly, Quebec,
Villeneuve had been making
short films for many years be-
fore rising to stardom. At the
age of 23, he won La Course
Europe-Asie 1990-91, a youth
film competition hosted by
Radio-Canada.
Maelström (2001)
The appearance of Mael-
ström across various festivals
worldwide in 2001, including
the Toronto International
Film Festival where it won
Best Canadian Film, was
when Villeneuve’s arthouse
breakthrough occurred. An
engrossingly dark and yet
quirky comic tale, it follows
the depressed alcoholic Bib-
iane struggle to keep things
together, as a hit-and-run
accident leaves her situation
looking bleaker than ever. It
delves deep into the meaning
underneath the apparently
glossy surface of the life she
has come to lead, and won
five Genie awards including
Best Motion Picture. Oh - and
it’s narrated by a fish that’s
waiting to be chopped up for
food. What’s not to like?
Polytechnique (2009)
Evidently Villeneuve was
once not as prolific a filmmak-
er as he seems to be now.
Made eight years after his
breakthrough, with nothing
between save for the short
film Next Floor in 2008 (which
won the Short Film Palme
D’Or at the Cannes Film
Festival),it was nonetheless
also very successful, winning
nine Genie awards including
Best Director and Best Motion
Picture. A rather more contro-
versial film than Maelström,
it dramatises the events of the
December 1989 “Montreal
Massacre”, when a young
man walked into the École
Polytechnique in Montreal and
shot 28 people, killing 14, and
specifically targeted women.
One critic said that though
it seemed like a paradox to
say so, Villeneuve had turned
the events of that day into “a
work of profound beauty”.
Incendies (2010)
Incendies was where Ville-
neuve’s career really kicked
off. Garnering huge critical
acclaim at both the Venice
and Toronto film festivals,
it went on to be selected to
represent Canada in the Acad-
emy Awards’ Best Foreign
Language Film category, and
was ultimately selected as
one of the five nominees for
With stars like Hugh Jack-
man, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul
Dano and Viola Davis on
board, Villeneuve was finally
swinging in the big leagues
of Hollywood when the
release of Prisoners rolled
around. Thankfully he didn’t
let the fame get to him, and
this dense, dark slow-burn-
ing thriller is one of the most
captivating works he’s put to
the screen. Set in the damp,
snow-slurried suburbs of Penn-
sylvania at thanksgiving, it fol-
lows Keller Dover (Jackman),
his wife Grace (Maria Bello),
and their friends Franklin and
Nancy Birch (Terrence How-
ard and Davis respectively)
as their peaceful livelihoods
are shattered by the disap-
pearance of their children.
When the active detective Loki
(Gyllenhaal) finds a suspect
(Dano), Keller decides to take
matters into his own hands. It’s
a film that works as a thriller,
a mystery, a crime drama
and a dual character study,
perfectly capturing the unrav-
elling of Keller and Loki as
they hit dead end after dead
end. Prisoners received critical
acclaim in the USA and estab-
lished Villeneuve as a talent to
be watched closely.
Enemy (2013)
As if to counteract this newly
established fame, Villeneuve
released Enemy almost
immediately after Prisoners.
The film is a much shorter
affair than its predecessor,
but is more complex and less
mainstream. When Adam Bell
(Jake Gyllenhaal, not only
doubling up on Villeneuve
films but here doubling up
on lead roles as Adam and
Anthony Claire) rents out a
film on the recommendation
of a colleague, he recognises
an extra who looks eerily
similar to him - looking him
up, he finds that he is Anthony
Claire, a man who appears
to be his doppelgänger. The
cataclysmic events that are
set in motion when he sets out
to find his mysterious likeness
begin to tear apart the fabric
of Adam and Anthony’s lives.
The enigmatic but brilliatn-
ly-used motif of spiders is one
of the film’s most uniquely
chilling aspects - and Ville-
neuve clearly wanted it to be
kept that way, as part of the
cast’s contractual agreements
was that none of them were
to disclose the meaning of the
spiders to the public.
Sicario (2015)
The work that cemented
Villeneuve’s status as the fore-
most craftsman of thought-pro-
voking thrills working in Hol-
lywood today can be found
in Sicario, a war-crime-drama
about the painful futility of an
individual’s quest to do the
right thing in the face of the
machine of war. Emily Blunt
stars as crack FBI agent Kate
Macer, assigned to a mission
by CIA officer Matt Graver
(Josh Brolin) to apprehend
a cartel operative. When
Kate meets Matt’s mysterious
partner Alejandro (Benicio
del Toro) and a routine bor-
der-crossing pickup operation
turns into one of the most
intense traffic jams in cinema
history, Kate begins to realise
that this is much more than a
simple arrest.
Tom Stephens
the award. It follows a pair of
twins who, after their mother’s
death, learn from her will that
they have a brother they did
not know existed, and that
their presumed-dead father is
still alive. When they travel to
an unnamed Middle-Eastern
country to find their family
and learn more about their
mother’s past, a series of flash-
backs begin to render their
mother’s story more clearly.
The binds of family and the
horrors of the past weave to-
gether to form a breathtaking-
ly complex and heartbreaking
cinematic tapestry.
