Let the debate begin. In the white corner sits Owain, out of
the black comes tintin. The issue: natural born killers.
Down stream floats the river wild. A.Dri-An dives in.
As an exhibition of Willem de Kooning's art opens at the
Tate, the 'greatest living painter' sits in a nursing home
suffering from senile dementia. Tintin squares the circle.
Name a famous Belgian? Vik rattles off five thanks to a live
visitation of dEUS. Back home, Alok grapples with sleeper's
Louise Wener and tintin hoovers up with velo-deluxe.
Hot on the trail of his all time favourite band, Vik tracked
down the remnants of It Bites and talked to its one time
frontman, Francis Dunnery.
Hot chemistry action as Helen-Louise and Sfu 'Stewpot' Stu
weave their spells over the latest batch of rotation.
Time for a bedtime story? Fiona tidies top-to-toe in the
fashion column that reaches parts that others fail to grasp.

effort to save their
ff" marriage sees Gail
W l w (Meryl Streep) and Tom
(David Strathairn) take
their ten year old son on a rafting
trip, in the river wild. Whilst there
however, they are hijacked by
Wade (Kevin Bacon) and Terry
(John C. Re///y) who have robbed a
cattle auction and are making a
slow getaway down the river. They
want Gail, an ex-river guide, to
take them through 'the Gauntlet',
a deadly stretch of Whitewater.
As with the fire in 'Backdraft'
here the river is the major player
which really raises the film above
the norm. Actually filmed on some
of the most dangerous stretches of
Whitewater in the world, the river
take on a character of its own,
especially if seen on a very large
screen. It is able to act as an
additional character and set the
tone by being, for example, serene
and calm or fast and fierce.
Kevin Bacon is quite sinister as
a 'different kind of nice guy', but it
is Meryl Streep, in another
excellent performance, who
manages to create a new heroine
for the 90s. However director
Curtis Hanson ('the hand that rocks
the cradle') is astute enough to
realise no amount of star power
can compete with the river. He
uses long sweeping shots up the
river canyon which both show of
the beauty of the country and
makes the rapids look impressively
lethal. This creates, especially for
non-rafters, a thrilling and
exhilarating sensation which helps
to draw the viewer in.

natural born killers
N a t u r a l b o r n killers is not a
satire of violence in the media.
Rather, it is a lifesize model of such
violence. Thus, critics of the film
miss the point. Invariably they
argue that the protagonists are
amoral and that the film lacks
characters with any depth, not
realising that this is precisely the
stance taken by the 'Real Life
Killers' type programmes that clog
the American airwaves. They do not
deplore the violence (no worse then
other ultra-violent films) but rather
they deplore being shown even a
glimpse of the true blood behind
this week's 'Rapist in the Hood'.
Their argument is not with NBK but
with the trash culture which
spawned it.
NBK 'isn't a film', I've been
told because it lacks a strong moral
resolution. Apart from this hilarious
attempt to categorise films
according to some rigid predeter-
mined concept, the concept itself is
ludicrous. So Stone can't make his
Faustian pact of a movie without
including a Forest Gump ending?
Good grief! That is precisely the
point - NBK is a mega-fast pop
montage of celluloid thick screen-
death. It is breathtaking, funky,
fast, fluid (presumably if it was shot
on stodgy black and white video in
three takes in Poland it would have
escaped censure) and absolutely
not about using defunct rules to try
to tell people what to think.
Rather it is an attempt to make
the popular cinema goer think at
all, using the medium in a new and
ambiguous way. And if attempting
to educate the masses through the
only medium that they are
interested in is heresy, then may
Stone burn in piles of videos on the
front page of the Sun.

Noifyral born killers is the most
powerful film I've seen; well I've
never felt like walking out of a
cinema before.
Whilst many films have gone
down the route of perverting
figures of authority -what film
nowadays doesn't have crooked
policemen and prison wardens?-
normally some semblance of
balance is kept thanks to the anti-
hero construction. Not Stone.
Mickey and Mallory are amoral,
unthinking figures. Even their
victims only figure as grovelling
wretches, whimpering to be left
alive. There are no humans in this
film which is why it is so sickening.
It's not that the violence is
especially gory, there's no severed
ears or potential flamings, but all
of it is brutal in a way that
Tarantino avoids.
It's a comparison that people
might be surprised about, but I've
always felt that Tarantino is a
moral writer. He's so steeped in
cinematic tradition that he doesn't
attempt to make 'realistic films'.
His films are clever because he
plays on the syntax of cinema's
stereotyped genres and makes us
laugh when his gangsters engage
in deep semantic conversations or
when their gun goes off by
mistake. You might flinch at his
violence but it's never inhuman,
it's just a moving picture on a
silver screen.
Stone's films, fuelled by his
desire to 'make a statement', are
attempts at reality (at least as he
sees it). So when he attempts a
satirical vision of media violence,
he doesn't just falls into the trap of
becoming what he seeks to mock,
he crashes into a full scale
embrace.
