Beit Brawl Arrest
BY A N D R E W S M I T H
A student from Hammersmith
College was arrested last Friday
night after attempting to gain
entry to Imperial College Union
(ICU). U n i o n stewards recog-
nised a group of three students
who were thought to have been
involved in an attack at the end
of last term.
D u r i n g the incident on
November 25th, actual bodily
harm was inflicted on a female
steward, while a number of other
U n i o n employees had to be
treated i n hospital. N o arrests
were made at the time. But, last
Friday, P C Clive Coleman
arrested the student concerned
and took him to Belgravia Police
Station for questioning.
The male youth alleged to
have been involved in the violent
assault has not yet been charged,
and was given police bail to
appear gain on the 10 March. P C
Coleman has yet to indicate
whether the case will proceed. He
has said that he w i l l decide
whether to drop charges, caution
or charge the man after
consulting the original
documents, and by making
further enquiries.
The arrest was made possible
after a steward who was involved
in the fracas last term recognised
the alleged assailant at the
entrance to I C U . Another
steward ran from the U n i o n
building to policemen who were
patrolling a function taking place
in the Royal Albert Hall.
P C Coleman, who was
involved in the aftermath of the
original incident, was one of
those working, and together with
a number of other officers, they
made their way to the Union.
The three suspects were delayed
at Beit Arch by stewards until
the police arrived.
The student, who was later
arrested, had the offence put to
him while standing in Beit Arch,
but he denied having been
involved in the crimes.
News In Brief
B Y A N D R E W S M I T H A N D
J O H N SINNER
U L U Election Farce
With the University of London
Union supposedly representing
over 70,000 of the capitals
students the union elections next
Tuesday appear to be somewhat
farcical.
O n l y one of the seven
positions is being contested, that
of Vice President (Finance &
Societies). Ian Parish, one of
ICU's Deputy Presidents, is one
of Tara Jefferson's seven
seconders for this post. The other
candidate for the contested job is
Caroline Bright of the School of
Slavonic and East European
Studies.
No one from Imperial is
standing. T h e only other I C
involvement is the seconding by
Lucy Chothia, ICU President, of
Kate Goldfarb and by Sarah
Waiman, Chair of I C Jewish
Society, of Mark Krushner. The
decision on whether to elect the
candidates who have declared, or
to re-open nominations will be
taken at a U L U General Union
Council on 28 February.
Illegal Parking to Stop
Imperial College is having
parking barriers installed i n
Watt's W a y , next to the
Southside Halls. Their purpose is
to prevent the general public
from parking illegally i n spaces
reserved for Imperial College
staff and students.
The barriers will be operated
by encoded magnetic cards. In an
interview w i t h F E L I X , M r s
Straw, Imperial College Facilities
Manager made an assurance that
there would be no restrictions on
current use. The option of the
public paying to get access to the
Watt's Way parking is also ruled
out.
Work has already begun and
will be finished by the middle of
March.
Lord Archer
Oh dear. Starting to feel rather
sorry for the Conservative
Society, I had hoped that this
week we could redress the issue
with a prominent Jeffrey Archer
story. Unfortunately, as reported
in the news pages, Lord Archer
denied Consoc this glowing
opportunity. Is it any wonder that
politicians have so little respect in
the public eye? It seems strange
that a private meeting was
publically advertised for at least a
week beforehand. I'm sure that
Lord Archer would argue that,
rather than reflect poorly on
himself, his decision shows the
lack of respect that he has for the
media. Afraid that one small
comment could be blown up out
of all proportion, the politician is
forced to speak in verbose liquidy
prose that has been through ten
sub-edtors. B u t regardless of
whose fault it was, he's saying
that when a politician speaks
frankly, the world cannot know.
And that might explain a lot.
Elections
You'd never guess from the walls
of the Union building that it was
election time now, would you?
Well, at least you can keep away
the last few weeks of winter with
a cheap clean fuel. To make your
own election publicity burner,
simply find yourself a dustbin,
knock some holes in the bottom
to allow air in and fill to the brim
with the offending candidates'
material. Actually, I did see one
of those men who live i n
shopping trolleys i n South
Kensington fasten a four point
plan of action to the back of his
home a couple of days ago.
Thankfully he hasn't found any
of the posters using photos yet!
Easter Edition
By 'eck, this terms flown by.
W i t h a bumper Easter edition
approaching fast, I'd really like to
hear (soon!) from anyone with
any features ideas and also from
anyone interested in organising a
spectacular quiz for that issue,
with proper prizes. So budding
Bruce Forsythes, come on down!
Blue Moon
I was going to write about the
centre pages here, about a big
idea I had regarding Klein and
physics and finally bridging the
gap that this year's F E L I X
seems to have chosen to tackle.
But I think I've had enough of
Art for a few weeks.
Football, there's a subject for
real discussion! I know I don't get
out much so can someone please
explain to me what a 'bung' is? If
nothing else, it means that
George Graham's saga can't be
made into a Hollywood block-
buster. I can't really see Graham,
played by say, Kevin Costner in a
rare 'evil' good man role, loitering
about the H i g h b u r y grounds
touting his facility to accept
'bungs', can you?
He had it all - Fame, Wealth,
Two Christian Names. He was 'The
Arsenal', he was feared throughout
the land. But there was one thing
George Graham didn't have. He
didn't have a BUNG!
Graham's Squeeze: No Graham,
you told me you were over it, you
told me you'd left all that behind!
Graham: I'm sorry my dear, but a
man's gotta do etc. I feel the one -
the need for a Bung!
'Top Bung' - the story of life at
the edge ofsanity.
Wait, wasn't Bung a Tony
Hart plasticine model? D i d G G
suffer as a child? I'm so confused!
