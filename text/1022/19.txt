Standby
Francis Dunnery
Â© throwing out the dreffi
" G o o d evening ladies and
gentlemen, my name's Francis -
caffeine addict, sex addict and
alcoholic." With those disarming
words, Francis Dunnery greets the
packed crowd at his acoustic gig in
Camden Lock's Dingwalls. "Francis
who?" you ask. Allow me to put you
in the picture...
Once upon a time there was a
Cumbrian band called It Bites. Many
of you may be young enough to
remember their one and only hit,
'calling all the heroes' - a
whimsical, fantastical pop song that
made the top 10 back in August
1986. In retrospect though, the
release of that single was a mistake
in that they were instantly perceived
as just another pop band. Their first
album, the big lad in the windmill,
was a patchwork quilt of heavy rock,
progressive rock, and pop, not
dissimilar to Genesis before Phil
Collins turned them into a limp,
flaccid affair. By the time of their
third album, eat me in st. louis, It
Bites had evolved into a hard-
hitting, progressive metal outfit. Just
as it looked like they were about to
break through (having just played
two sold out shows at the then
Hammersmith Odeon) lead singer,
songwriter and guitarist supremo,
Francis Dunnery, quit. After two solo
albums, a stint as Robert Plant's
lead guitarist and an alcohol
cleaning-up exercise in between,
he's back to play his first gigs in this
country for five years. Before the gig
I chatted to the Plant-christened
'Mad Frank' about his life at the
moment.
"It's nice. I guess the key to it
all is that I stopped drinking. Two
years and eight months ago
actually. I had to, because I almost
killed myself on several occasions ...
eventually it wears you down and
you end up on your knees. I have a
disease, and I've got to take care of
it. 'We're born less than, so we act
more than' is kind of an alcoholic
trait, you always tend to think
bigger than you are. You set
yourself impossible tasks and when
you can't live up to them you get
upset ... so we drink to numb those
very sensitive nerve ends out. But
life's good today. I have a good
laugh."
After watching the gig, I think
that 'a good laugh' is the best way
to describe Dunnery's on-stage
demeanour. After the earlier
opening line he tells us that "there's
something I've always wanted to do
on stage" and proceeds to make a
cup of tea. In between songs, he
cracks self-effacing jokes about his
ex-wife. "She saw me drunk and
thought, 'What an a***hole'. She
saw me sober and said, 'What an
even bigger a***hole'." As for the
music, let's just say that it was every
bit as sublime and awe-inspiring as
you would expect from the frontman
of a band who, to these ears, were
the best ever.
'Homegrown' and 'american
life in the summertime' are both
from last year's fearless album. They
take on a new dimension live, and
stripped to their bare acoustic
bones, they bleed with emotion.
'Feel like kissing you again' is even
more pathos-soaked, as an ode to
his dead father who beat him when
he was younger. "I couldn't feel
anything because I was drunk, and
it was only when I got sober that I
sorted out how I really felt about
him, and wrote this song."
But it was 'underneath your
pillow' and the incandescently
beautiful 'still too young to
remember' that sent frissons of
excitement down the spine of each
individual in the room - two
wonderful songs written by a late,
great band. It says much that Virgin
have decided to release a 'Best of...'
collection five years after It Bites
split up. And it says even more that
'Mad Frank' has managed to come
through alcoholism to emerge as a
man wise beyond his years. I'll leave
you with some words with which you
can chew the proverbial fat; "You
wanna make God laugh, then make
some plans. We sit there and try to
plot our lives out ... 'I'll do this, then
I'll do that.' It ain't like that. You
can't start plotting and trying to out-
smart, out-think, out-do, out-
perform the whole world ... I don't
say that this is the way it is - it's just
the way that I live my life. It's really
none of my business what the world
thinks of me. It's my business what I
think of the world." He pauses with
an air of sudden revelation: "When I
was drinking the world was full of
a***holes. Since I stopped drinking I
can't find any a***holes, and the
world hasn't changed has it?"
No it hasn't, but maybe it
should... 0

One of my earliest memories is that
of my mother coming to kiss me
goodnight before she went out for
dinner, muskily scented and elegant
in an long A-line skirt that just swept
the floor. Then I was in bed and half
asleep, now I'm desperately hoping
that she still has the skirt...
The A-line, having entered our
wardrobes last year, still holds its
own amidst the 50's revival, and
elegance is still the key. However,
while last year it meant Hollywood,
this year recall the girls from 'Alio
'Alio whose clothes always clung
and whose attitudes were nothing if
not wanton. Whether the faithful A-
line or pencil thin, skirts should
leave no one in any doubt of the
shape of your hips, and tops should
be just short enough to display
waists clad in skinny, patent leather
belts. In an era that smacks of the
frumpish, ridiculously high heels and
vampish hair are the key.
It is an oft quoted fact that it
doesn't matter so much what you
wear as what you do with your shoes
and hair. If not glossy and
controlled, hair should look full
bodied and slightly back-combed -
an off perfect finish along the lines
of 'I've just had a good roll in the
hay'. This, apparently, has an
undeniably sexy effect.
Obviously, with the onset of the
Vamp, girlish plaits are a little passe,
along with just about anything else a
student can afford. So it's off to Vidal
Sassoon to offer oneself up as a
sacrifice to the developing artistry of
the student hairdresser. Just
remember that it's free, so there's
no money back if you decide you
don't like sky-blue highlights. 0
