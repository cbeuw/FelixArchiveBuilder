Incoming
Academic Despair and a Conservative Backlash
Affairs
Dear Felix,
Having previously been both an
Academic and Departmental
Representative for the Department
of Computing, I was interested to
read the piece "Half-Hearted Day"
(FELIX 1020) about the most recent
Academic Affairs half day.
To anyone who has never been
involved in academic affairs it must
have been strange to read that
subjects such as the price of bread
and fire-alarms were discussion
topics, perhaps assuming that it
was just a case of bad journalism.
Unfortunately this has not been the
case as for as long as I can
remember, the discussions have
rarely been based around the
important issues concerning the
academic affairs of college.
The 'network' of Academic
Representatives and Officers is
supposedly there so that all
students may voice their opinions
at all levels, be it a simple
complaint about a lecturer or a
more wide-spread problem. The
Academic Affairs half day is an
opportunity for all involved to meet
with their counterparts to discuss
departmental and college-wide
problems and then to put them to
the panel of college staff.
Recently we have seen the
introduction of a Student
Representative Council to make it
easier for students to air and
resolve non-academic issues, but
I'm sceptical that this will ever
have the required effect. The fact is
that the Academic Reps, one or
two from every course and year,
are a much broader representation
of students than those on the
council.
Perhaps the channels of
communication between the
students, staff and the Union
should be more clearly defined, so
that the Academic Affairs 'network'
can be used for its original
purpose.

More politics
Dear Felix,
I feel that I must comment on
your somewhat biased writings
concerning LabSoc and ConSoc.
Let me firstly make it quite clear
that the two societies both try to
work together to make Imperial
College a place where some
political debate actually takes
place, unlike at present where the
populace of the college seems to
be overcome by apathy. The
comments on last weeks letters
page only show how incapable of
listening some people can be.
There is harmony between the two
societies, the only "gape" between
us is created in the page editor. If
had read Ian Bayley's letter
properly, he would not have
written such ludicrous comments.
Concerning the "News in Brief"
article, we did not "Snub yet
another prominent Tory M.P." as
you intone. The word snub implies
that we consciously arranged not
to hold a meeting for Mrs Gorman
for the sole purpose of
inconveniencing her. I would have
expected more that News of the
World style reporting from Felix. In
actuality a large portion of the
blame for this incident lies with the
I.C. union office for failing to pass
on the message from Mrs
Gorman's private office which
confirmed the meeting. We
naturally assumed that Mrs
Gorman could not attend the
meeting as no reply was received.
In addition, the statement
concerning Mrs Gorman's taxi fare
is misleading. It was in fact already
agreed that were she to visit, we
would pay this - it was not
intended to punish in for "Sheer
Ineptitude" as you put it. I assume
that David Hunt was the other Tory
that we snubbed. This is clearly not
the case. It is interesting that some
2 0 0 people turned up to hear Tony
Benn speak, it shows that some
are never willing to listen to
anyones point of view except for
their own - otherwise why is it that
the ConSoc meetings are not this
(Sub)Edited this week by Paul Dias
well attended? The answer is clear
- because many people do not
want to listen to views that are not
their own - this is a fact of life and
it is not fair to lay the blame at
ConSocs or LabSocs door. We
accept that we have unpopular
views in the context of college,
however we have persevered to try
and bring some of the real world
of politics into the college and to
try and help people to be more
aware of what goes on in the
world around them. It is just a
shame that people cannot be
bothered or do not want to hear
these people speak. If people turn
up they can ask whichever
questions they wish - the more
controversial, the better in some
respects. I am personally
determined to do something
positive for this college.
In conclusion I don't think that it
is really fair to give us a slagging
every time a slight problem arises.
It would be much more helpful if
you were more constructive in your
approach and made people aware
that those who are after all elected
to govern this country are
represented here almost every
week, purely so that students can
air their grievances and ask
questions.
