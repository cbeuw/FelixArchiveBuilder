Having also lived life outside Felix,
Rachel has an abundance of ideas
waiting to get out! I believe she
has the ability to create a dynamic
and interesting paper.
Andrew Dorman-Smith, proposer.
Felix, as the student newspaper of
Imperial College, exists to inform
and entertain those who study
here. That can only happen if the
maximum number of enthusiastic
people are involved to produce it!
As Felix Editor/Print Unit Manager, I
intend to have more contributors,
to expand its range of interest and
perhaps lighten the tone. Student
involvement in the print unit is also
very important, so that we can
extend the services it provides.
NEWS
Felix should continue to expose the
scandals and encourage the
achievements of our college, but
there is life beyond South
Kensington. Our overseas popula-
tion, for example, could give us
insight into what is happening in
the rest of the world. I would like to
see the news pages develop to
show Imperial's perspective on a
range of issues.
SPORTS
Better contact between the sports
teams and the newspaper could
give more consistent coverage of
college's fixtures. I would like to
improve the continuity from one
week to the next. By compiling an
overall Imperial sports league, we
could get a better idea of how
teams are really doing.
ST. MARYS
I feel that it's really important that
communication improves through-
out our college. Obtaining St
Mary's involvement is a priority: at
the very least, a St Mary's news
reporter and a clubs and societies
correspondent are an absolute
necessity.
CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
This information has a tendency to
appeal only to those directly con-
cerned. I would like these pages
complementing the listings for the
week ahead. We need to see
what's going on and feel able to
get involved.
I'm proposing Annie because
she's paying me lots of money.
<no, no, start again>
The last time I wrote a manifesto
was when I was standing for this
post, two years ago. Having won
that election and done the job, I've
a pretty good idea (I hope) of what
it involves, which is why I'm
proposing Annie. I think she'll do
an excellent job, having both the
experience and motivation needed.
Unlike some, she's standing
because she wants to do something
useful for the Union, and not for
the fame and glory (which you
don't get anyway, and I should
know...).
Dave Goddard, proposer.
Hello. I'm Annie Matthewman,
and I'm standing for Deputy
President (Finance & Services).
Why? Good question.
In the future I want to do a PhD
in Virtual Reality, so no CV points
there. It sounds corny, but I want
the job because I know I'd enjoy
doing it, and be good at it.
How do I know? Well, this year
I control a budget of £1500, as ICU
Welfare Officer. From there, it's
just a small step to the union's £2m
annual turnover! I've been on the
union's council for two years, and
this year I'm on the executive as
well. I'm proposed by last year's
DP(F&S), Dave Goddard, and he
should know what the job involves.
I'm doing a master's degree -
paying my own fees - so I'm acute-
ly aware of the financial hardship
most students encounter.
Whoever you vote for in these
elections, please vote. This coming
year is very important for the
union. College is considering mov-
ing ICU from Beit to Sherfield with-
in two years. St. Mary's will move
to South Kensington within the
same time scale. The wrong choice
of sabbaticals could mean all stu-
dents lose out in a big way.
Ta.
The coming year will be important
for ICU, with talk of re-affiliation to
the NUS. (Although I am personally
opposed to this move, I believe the
decision is so important that a ref-
erendum is vital to take into
account the feelings of all stu-
dents).
The provision of affordable facil-
ities for all students is a major con-
cern in the current climate of falling
student income, and so I will look
into ways of keeping prices down
as much as possible in outlets on
campus.
Major changes will affect ICU over
the next few years, particularly the
movement of medics to South
Kensington and the proposed move
of the union to the Sherfield build-
ing.
I am opposed to moving the
union. The present location in the
Beit building gives the union a dis-
tinct identity. Extensive up-to-date
facilities within attractive surround-
ings provide the students with a
social venue with tradition behind
it, rather than a characterless
modernity which would be
inevitable with a transfer to
Sherfield. And why throw money
away when it is cheaper to stay
put?
The mixing of St. Mary's stu-
dents with the scientists of South
Kensington will be a great shake-
up. I believe that maintenance of
the traditions of all the CCUs is
important. The balance of rivalry
between constituent colleges with
the umbrella of ICU facilities opens
the door for an interesting social
life with something for everyone.
This can be maintained through
proper funding of the CCUs, with
enough supervision to ensure that
wasted money is kept to a mini-
mum.
I know that I have the ability to
succeed as DP(F&S), and I hope you
will give me the opportunity to
make a worthwhile contribution to
the Union.
