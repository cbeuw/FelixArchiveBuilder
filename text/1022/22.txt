IC Ladies set out with one aim, to

Luck (and : p rente skill) was
on our side, though*"mother
nature wasn't. Overcoming thun-
der and lighting, very very fright-
ening (me Galilleo, Galilleo...) We
will not let them score, (let them
score). No we will not let them
score. So we didn't, but they let us
seven times, Cheers UCL.
Another win for this extraor-
dinarily talentedhockey side,
bringing our goal tally for this
season up to 83!

tCMen 2nd vs Kings 1st HI
On a blustery Wednesday after-
noon IC took the field against a
load a posing knobs.
10 rni»jp$ later they were
whimpering as our amazing cap-
tain (Bill T.C.) scored an unbe-
lievable goal to lead 1 - 0. Mane
then poofed over and the game
stopped for an hour. Unfortun-
ately the poser knobs equalised
with a disgusting good short cor-
ner. But who cares!
After the usual half-time talk
from the less than illustrious cap
tain, we restarted. Soon, Plastic
man demonstrated his elastic wiz-
ardry, but to no avail. As usual
Lardy was mouthing off, but
playing his usual filth. Then
Mane poofed over again, and we
had time for a few fags before re-
commencing play. The defence
then contrived to allow the posey
gits to score again, despite
Oeker's valiant efforts between
the sticks. T1000 was stroppy-no
change there. The final score was
2 - 1 to the posers, but we're used
lo losing, and il was nearly the
full U L U squad.

The game shuifled shambolically
to a start when 14 players were
finally percured, half of which
had to have sonic Welsh back-
ground (ie. they'd heard of it).
An early try by EngtonffgotF -
the game of to a charactl|jstic * \
beginning, with the convlision
rebounding cheerfully off a pass-
ing Vauxhall Cavalier. Wales fol-
lowed with a quick but unconven-
tional score, but England
obtained a stronghold for the rest
of the unusually protracted 25
minute first half.
The second "half continued
much in the same vein with the
try of the garni surely going to my
surrogate player, Duncan
Thomson.
The match ended confusingly
after 15 minutes so there was suf-
ficient time for a few jars and to
catch the international.
Unfortunately several players
were tragically and shamelessly
lost in Turnham Wood after
jumping from the coach for a pee
and failing to catch it again.

IC 4th vs St. GeorgrkMedical School
The IC 4th team continue their
march towards promotion with
another impressive performance
against St. Georges last week. But
the final result, 4-0, wasn't as easi-
ly obtained as the scoreline sug-
gests. First the Northern Line in
the rush hour had to be con-
quered and then the squash courts
had to be found. Having over-
come this first hurdle the match
commenced. Nick, Gary and
Richard went through dodgy
patches before eventually recover-
ing to gain victory. Nick, coming
in at No.l, lost the third game of
his match but regained his com-:
posure to win through 3-1. Like
all good squash players he blamed
the court's slippy floor for him
not winning 3-0. Garry put in a
heroic performance to come back
from 2-1 down and three match
points down, before claiming the
fourth and fifth games, to win 3-2.
Alex, with his usual skill, won
comfortably 3-1, after a few scary
moments in the fourth game.
After a fine performance like this
one the 4th's look set to gain the
promotion they were so close to
obtaining last season.
