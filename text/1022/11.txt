Sabbatical Election Manifestoes
President: Miles Ambler Proposed By: Matt SzyndeI
I am currently in my final year of a
Chemistry degree.
This year I have looked after the
academic affairs of the Chemistry
students in my role as departmental
representative. At the moment I am
setting up an Email system to get
feedback on academic matters. I
am also captain of the IC Vlth foot-
ball team and a senior member of
the Chemistry Society committee.
I believe I would do an excellent
job as President. I have the relevant
experience. I care about our Union,
will listen to your views and act on
them.
As President:
• I will make the Union and, espe-
cially the President, more accessible
and accountable to us, the stu-
dents. I would set up an open
forum, at which I would answer any
questions you have about the
Union or my job.
• I will totally oppose any potential
Union move to the Sherfield build-
ing.
• I will fully inform you and act
upon your views on the NUS issue.
I am in favour of a referendum on
the subject.
• I will improve the entertainments
in the Union and college as a
whole, so that they are more
applicable to the students. This will
be partly achieved by introducing
an Ents representative in each
department.
• I will continue and improve the
commitment to the Constituent
College Unions; C&G, RCS, RSM
and St. Mary's.
• I will improve communications
between the Union and the stu-
dents. I intend to visit all first year
departments within the first two
weeks, and will continue the
process throughout the year by
using college media.
To conclude, I honestly believe I am
the best candidate for the position.
I hope I have illustrated that my
policies are not just fallacies.
IT'S YOUR UNION, MAKE YOUR
VOTE COUNT.
President: Kevin Ward Proposed By: John Turner
I am a third year student from
physics. I am standing for ICU pres-
ident because, my seconders and I
believe, that, ICU could greatly
benefit from my talents. The basic
feeling of my policies, is the
improving of IC for the benefit of
the students. That means to help
college maintain the academic
standards and provide good ser-
vices through the union. I will make
the union much more accessible to
everyone by advertising union
events and meetings much better
than at present. I will make every
endeavour to help the CCUs to
provide a vibrant identity for their
members, a vital part of IC life. I
believe that strong CCUs makes a
strong ICU which can then fight for
a better student life, in, and out, of
the classroom. I am for a referen-
dum on the NUS. I am going to
push for student representation on
the Management Planning Group
Committee, the only committee
without student representation. I
will reform ICU bars, and make
them fun. (I have been a successful
relief pub manager.) I aim to pre-
vent the move of ICU from Beit
Quad, and I have personally been
actively involved in research. I will
introduce professional stewards for
the union with a few students for
admission purposes, to reduce the
danger to students and stewards. I
also wish to make University of
London libraries more accessible to
Imperial students, at present some
charge money for their use. I wish
to review the cost of ICU life mem-
bership, which seems high. The
reformation of the Debating Society
and Real Ale Society, amongst oth-
ers, must be a priority in time for
next year's freshers' week. In short,
the image of ICU must improve via
not merely competitive excellence,
but also by cultural and social
experience.
President: Sarah White Proposed ill! : •' . '1

Everyone knows that I'd be lying if I
promised cheaper booze, bar
extensions every night, dirt-cheap
food and accommodation for
everyone. What I can quite happily
promise you is enthusiasm, drive
and determination to provide a
more helpful and effective Union,
that acts as both the voice of stu-
dents and the heart of I.C., trying to
get what you want, whether it be
realistically priced halls, better facil-
ities for your chosen activities or
more input into how the Union
functions (to name but a few).
As President of the main voice of
the student body I know that my
experience as Geology Dep. Rep.
and R.S.M.U. Welfare Officer shows
I communicate effectively with both
other students and College Staff in
order to get what you want. Next
year, if College continue their
presently unfeasible plans to move
many Union facilities into Sherfield
to make way for a Conference
Centre, we may be fighting to pre-
serve what we already have.
For many students I.C.U. means
more as the heart of I.C., providing
backing, funding and facilities (that
hopefully prevent us all from turn-
ing into a pack of lifeless zombies),
for a huge range of activities (none
of which I shall name for fear of
offending those I don't).
I want these activities to grow
stronger and to work together more
at all levels, from the C.C.U.s to the
smallest clubs, in order to achieve
more with what we have, and to
press for more recognition and
funding for all of them.
Finally, it's very difficult to explain
just why you should vote for me,
but I can only end by saying that I
have the drive and determination
to do this job, and I'd be dammed
good at it. So vote SARAH WHITE
for I.C.U. President.
