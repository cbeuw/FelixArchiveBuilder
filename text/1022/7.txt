'OUR COFFEE NEEDS ARE BEING OVERLOOKED"

THE SILKY NEEDLES
In a dark corner of the Electrical Engineering building, a coffee
machine stands, folorn and unresponsive, its lights off. The
floor is littered with empty, twisted Coke cans. The Mechanical
Engineering J C R tells the same, sad story. "The coffee
machine's been taken away", one student said, weakly. After
four o'clock i n the Chemistry department, a haggard student told me:
"There's no coffee machine here, but I think there's a kettle in Old
Chemistry". Students sitting on the biochemistry steps said: "There's
nothing for us at all".
Student culture dictates that life is punctuated by coffee breaks.
Imagine, then, the trauma affecting the students of departments where, as
one person told me "our coffee needs are being overlooked".
In this week's S-files, find out how your department rates in the great
S-files coffee survey. T h i s a l l -
encompassing expose of the good,
bad and ugly has been carried out
on behalf of the S-files by an addict
of many years' standing who goes
without food to pay for Douwe
Egberts After Dinner Roast. She
decided to include only those coffee
outlets to which undergraduates are
admitted. Several weeks of i n -
somnia aside, she felt that i f the
staff coffee turned out to be much
better, how would that make the
rest of us feel?
