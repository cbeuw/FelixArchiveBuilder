Ban By

Mary's students have banned
smoking in Gladys', the St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
restaurant, following a two day
referendum.
The referendum, held on
Wednesday and Thursday,
followed a debate on Tuesday of
the motion, 'This house believes
that smoking should be banned
in G l a d y s " . Proposing the
motion were, Paddy, Joffs as the
Ghost of Roy Castle, and Prash,
while Rich Birom, Nick Own and
Camilla Blake, spoke against it.
In a heated debate, chaired

There are still no candidates for
two of the City and G u i l d s
College U n i o n posts, and the
other positions have only one
candidate each. Sarah Thomas,
the current G u i l d s publicity
officer, is the only nominee for
President. With hustings due to
be held today, the unusual lack of
interest in the elections has been
surprising.
Duncan Tindall, Guildsheet
E d i t o r and Communications
officer, is standing for V i c e -
President, and James Tuff, an
Aero 1st year, has put himself
forward for the position of
Honorary Secretary. The posts of
Honorary Junior Treasurer, City
& Guilds College Association
Representative and Guildsheet
Editor are also uncontested.
As f e l i x went to press, no-
one is standing for the two
remaining executive posts of
Publicity Officer and Enter-
tainments Officer. The posts of
Academic Affairs Officer and
Departmental Societies Officer
w i l l be appointed by separate
committees.
In an attempt to explain the
worrying lack of interest, one
senior source i n the C & G C U
suggested that a relatively high
proportion of students in Guilds
departments are involved with
other organisations, such as
foreign students w i t h their
overseas societies. Other com-
mentators have blamed the lack
of interest in Guilds as the usual
'Imperial apathy problem'. Last
year's voting turnout was around
20%.
Hustings are due to take
place on Friday 24th February at
1.00pm in the Imperial College
Union Ents Lounge.
Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare spoke candidly at an IC Conservative Society meeting to over 30 people
Andrew Smith. Unfortunately he insisted that the publicly advertised meeting should be private and so the int
points that e made about the present prime minister, sexual scandals and his own salary cannot be reported
by Devina Hanson, the risks of
smoking, highlighted by various
painted sponges, were submitted
as reasons for the ban. In
retaliation, those opposed to the
ban advanced claimed that the
amount of smoke inhaled i n
Gladys' would not do any
significant damage to non-
smokers. This was emphasised by
the opposition table chain
smoking their way through the
proceedings.
113 votes were cast in favour
of the motion, while 73 voted
against and 49 voted for a
compromise.

the erection of the Basic Medical
Science b u i l d i n g came a step
closer this week. V i r g i n i a
Bottomley, Secretary of State for
Health, announced that she is
willing 'in principle' to commit
money to the construction. It is
still not clear, though, whether
the other main partner i n this
new centre of excellence, the
Higher Education F u n d i n g
Council of England (HEFCE), is
likely to cough up in the near
future.
D r Rodney Eastwood,
Deputy Managing Director who
is coordinating Imperial
College's application, admitted
that he was very pleased by the
Minister's comments. D r
Eastwood warned that although
the signs are encouraging, he is
not 'counting his chickens'.
A decision by H E F C E is
now expected before Easter with
approximately half the money
anticipated as coming from the
funding body. With a review by
the Treasury still continuing, all
decisions regarding the exact
amount of money each
organisation will contribute have
yet to be decided.
Despite the remaining
uncertainties all concerned are
said to be encouraged, as Virginia
Bottomley is the second Cabinet
Minister to have supported the
proposal this month.
