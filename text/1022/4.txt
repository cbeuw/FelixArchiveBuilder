Opinion

I
mperial is regarded by
many as a cultural void. It's
a machine designed solely
for the purpose of produc-
ing individuals who w i l l lead
their fields, creating seemingly
single-minded automata with no
contact with the 'normal' life
outside their own small sphere.
A column i n a recent F E L I X
('Cat & Mouse', 1019), expressed
just these opinions. Kaizen, the
author, pointed a finger at that
most feared ogre of Imperial -
the dreaded 'IC apathy'. I too
believed in this condition about a
year ago, but now believe this is
not necessarily the case...
Commonly a sense of dedi-
cation and single-mindedness
leads to the perpetrator being
labelled as 'sad' and 'socially
inadequate'. Why should this be?
In most other fields, ambition
and skill are judged as assets, and
single-mindedness a treasured
commod-ity. Yet in the sciences,
this is not so. Why?
One possible reason is the
media, and the influence of
public opinion. Films such as
'The Googy Professor' and the
various 'Frankensteins' have
reinforced a stereotypical view of
individuals from ivory towers
(usually with speech imped-
iments and short-sightedness)
who don't understand the
consequences of their actions.
T h i s o p i n i o n isn't that new,
either. In the '30s, the Spanish
philosopher, Ortega y Gasset,
wrote, "the decrease in scientific
vocations noted in recent years ... is
an anxious symptom for anyone who
has a clear idea of what civilisation
is, an idea generally lacking to the
typical 'scientist'."
What is it that makes
scientists so different from
'cultured' people? Take students
from the Royal College of Music.
Their lives dedicated to music,
they are, by default, cultured.
We dedicate our lives to the
sciences. Therefore, we are not
cultured? Surely there is a
b l i n k e d anomaly here
somewhere? Y o u could say that
the principle of 'culture' is based
upon a pro-humanitarian-biased
society. Either you get it, or you
don't.
principle of 'apathy' is applied by
those that become terribly self-
conscious, and don't want to
become compartmentalised.
Imagine what went through
Freshers' minds this year, on
picking up their first issue of
F E L I X . There, complete with
train-spotter pictures, was a guide
to the different types of people
seen at IC. I can't remember the
details, but I'm sure it included
the terms 'spod', 'hack', and
How can we, as scientists, become
cultured? IC has both the Haldane
library, and the humanities courses, to
help produce 'balanced' individuals.
But, I ask, what is the point?
How can we, as scientists,
become cultured? As you are no
doubt aware, I C has both the
Haldane library and the
humanities courses to help
produce 'balanced' individuals.
But, I ask, what is the point? If
somebody wants to expand their
own horizons, then fair enough,
the scheme is excellent. But why
try and force culture down those
who don't particularly want it? I
am not alone i n this opinion.
The Nobel laureate, Sir Peter
Medawar, wrote "...mercifully, the
whole hideous scheme of piping on
cultural lectures for scientists came to
nothing in any university I have ever
been associated with, thus sparing
some well-meaning mediocrity the
embarrassment of watching the bored
writhings of students of Chem Eng
morally coerced into attending
lectures on the English novel or on
the origins of the Romantic
movement in Germany."
He then goes on to point
out "...that students of humane
letters are not in the least likely to
benefitfrom attendance at lectures on
[science]. The trouble is that young
students of Eng. Lit. simply don't
want to know much of what the
average science lecturer would be
able to impart to him." W h y ,
should humanities be justified as
'culture', but science not?
We all know it's very easy
to stereotype. I feel that this

'rugger-bugger'. What else would
a self-conscious individual think,
but' I do N O T want to be seen as
one of these stereotypes?'
I edit Broadsheet and care
about what I do, hence earning
me the title 'hack', a term I
deeply despise. Similarly
hundreds of people r u n and
participate in the largest selection
of clubs and societies of any
college i n the country. I can
name several people, for example,
who would rather remove their
internal organs than be denied
OpSoc. Is this 'apathy'?
As far as I can see, those
that wield the term 'apathy' as a
weapon are seared of the stigma
involved with admitting you
have other interests. I feel that
'apathy' is more a self-descriptive
term of the user, wielded as a
complaint about their lack of
trust in IC's 'unique' atmosphere.
True, we do not have culture
directly to hand, i n the shape of
humanities students, but we can
bring it i n ourselves; and do,
successfully. For those of you
that don't believe me, then why
not try getting off your arse and
finding people who share your
interests - there are a hell of a lot
of us! Culture will only come to
those that seek it. If you don't
want it, then fair enough - just
don't complain about a lack of
action in others !
T h i s is m y personal
opinion. If you are sceptical, then
I invite you to write to F E L I X ,
and air your opinions. Changes,
both physical and i n
understanding, can only come
about through actions. O r
perhaps you're too apathetic...
