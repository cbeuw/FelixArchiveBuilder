Sabbatical Election Manifestoes
'roposed By: Tim St Clair
Luke's diverse Union experience
includes being a STOIC actor and
writer, RockSoc member and Third
World First poster and event organ-
iser. He was also projectionist and
subsequently chair of the Science
Fiction Society for a year and is cur-
rently Social Clubs Committee
chair. This means he co-ordinates
the activities of all religious, politi-
cal and miscellaneous societies in
the Union, which involves liaising
with both society chairs and the
current sabbaticals. He recently
ran a week-long set of events
aimed at raising awareness of ide-
ological issues related to SCC soci-
eties, while he keeps up to date
with broader Union developments
in his role at Council and Union
Finance Committee meetings.

My background shows that I will be
capable of ensuring non-preferen-
tial treatment and accessibility for
all clubs and societies, for instance
as regards room bookings. I want
to encourage both inter-society col-
laboration in areas of possible
overlap such as ArtSoc and
DramSoc or past agreements
between JapanSoc and SciFi, and
higher society profiles in the avail-
able media. This also applies to
the Constituent College Union soci-
eties if they wish.
Further, I would like to draw on
existing resources by informing
societies about the Events &
Marketing Manager and how he
can help publicise what they do.
This co-operation could lead to
themed society events similar to
Third World First's Brazilian
Night/Sol Beer promotion.
Related to this is better interac-
tion between the broad sub-groups
of societies (MSCs) whose chairs
could meet regularly to discuss
matters of mutual concern, for
instance more effective use and
expansion of facilities like the pro-
posed sports hall extension. This
would allow the handling of soci-
ety-specific problems, such as ath-
letics training, by those closer to
them.
Finally, I believe that my wide-
ranging abilities make me a good
candidate for the'job.

Tim Townend is a good communi-
cator with a friendly personality
and is the ideal candidate. While at
Imperial College his energy and
motivation have helped him to
build an extensive knowledge of
the workings of the Union clubs
and societies. He is currently
Exploration Society Treasurer and
Rugby Club Captain where he con-
tributes substantially to the social
and practical sides of College. Due
to his close ties with these and
other clubs he is aware of the
demands that will be placed upon
him as D.P. (Clubs and Societies).
As Chairperson of the Athletic
Clubs Committee I have spent an
extensive amount of time working
Tim, and can say he is capable of
doing an excellent job.
Karl Drage, proposer.
As Deputy President I aim to
resolve many of the difficulties that
have confronted me and other stu-
dents. Many of these points are
important to give you the opportu-
nities and balanced education you
require. My main objectives are
outlined below:
-Promote and encourage the
Arts societies: Providing a better
balance of opportunities between
the Cultural societies and the
Sports clubs.
-Regain I.C.'s national sporting
status: Following discussions with
the new Sports and Leisure
of coaching in all college sports.
-Ensure student recreational
improvements: Extend and unify
recreational resources with lower
pricing on existing facilities yet
maintaining the individuality of
each CCU.
-Extend club social links:
Annual RCC Clubman's / A C C
Sportsman's Dinners and interac-
tion with St.Mary's.
-Improve student awareness:
Introduce a 'Soc. Contact' notice
board and a mid-year fair to pro-
mote clubs and societies.
-Develop a 'SPORT FOR ALL'
policy: The creation of faculty
sports leagues to raise money for
RAG and promote social sport
with both this years Sabbaticals and Manager, I will obtain a high level throughout College.

Can you imagine how hard it is to
write this type of material for the
first time? Well, I guess I'll just be
honest and tell you why I think I
should do the job.
Concerning the job and what it
entails, I believe I have a good idea
already. I am currently the captain
of college's Ladies Association
Football Club, running it single-
handedly, having to deal with all its
matters from playing to treasury
(nowadays), to fixtures and all other
arrangements. This has given me
first hand experience of the dedica-
tion and organisation that goes into
running a college club, which
means I am quite appreciative of
the workload involved for this
Deputy President.
My clubs' experience is not just in
sports. I have sat on the OSC exec-
utive committee, which involved me
with several societies and their
smooth running. Also, I have been
and am a member of various other
clubs and societies (an executive on
some, an ordinary member on oth-
ers), as well as closely observing
the running of many others.
So, as far as my capability of han-
dling the job goes, I think you will
agree the job will be safe with me!
The above covers the job title, but
obviously there is more to it than
that. As an executive involved in
the running of the Union I shall find
out what you the student would like
to happen, whether you are unhap-
py with College or you simply think
the bar extensions should be longer
and more frequent, I will stand up
for you representing your require-
ments to those higher up.
I will deal with students' problems
when elected. I am going for this
post, because I want to achieve
something for us.
