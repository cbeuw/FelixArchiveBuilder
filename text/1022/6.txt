POLITICAL SCIENCE
Reductionism employs a top-down
method of analysis. It looks at a
system from above and breaks it
down into well-defined parts. The
prime ideology of Reductionism is
that a system is the sum of its
parts. More importantly, the Effect
of the system arises from well-
defined parts. Or, and this is the
case that Reductionists look for, a
well-defined part is the Cause of
the system's Effect. In a way, this
somewhat Newtonian view of
systems is understandable. Analysis
seeks for the cause, the more
simple it is the better.
An example of Reductionism
is biological determinism. This is
the Doctrine of DNA; the idea that
we are determined by our genes.
The Reductionist idea is to go for
the parts, the genes, notice that
they cause some effects on the
whole system, and label them the
pivotal engine for the whole
system.
The Harvard geneticist
Lewontin argues against
Reductionism in his Biology as
Ideology. His argument is based
mainly on the fact that we do not
know; that sufficient evidence is
not around to say "gene X
determines characteristic Y". His
argument also relies on the fact
that proponents of Reductionism -
perhaps like all Science proponents
- have an agenda. In the case of
biological determinism, or to be
more specific, in the case of the
Human Genome Project, there are
biotechnology companies to be
founded, profits to be earned,
papers to author, reputations to be
made. Lewontin has pointed out
the close link that American
academic geneticists have with
commercial enterprise. The agenda
can become ever more frightening.
Alastair Palmer, writing in the
current issue of The Spectator,
argues against Hernstein and
Murray's The Bell Curve, which
justifies racism by biology.
Of course, the complete
opposite view to Reductionism is a
holistic view of systems. That too
seems disagreeable to me. There is
a religio-spiritual aspect about the
Holistic methodology that seems
retrograde. The answer lies, as
always, in between. By refusing the
absolute, perhaps we are back at a
definition of Science as organised,
rational scepticism.

Walking down Oxford Street. It's
the Christmas rush, tourists
everywhere, crowds of ovine
shoppers all in a rush to go
nowhere. The sun shines down
from a clear blue weekend sky but
it's cold enough to freeze the
bollocks off a st. Bernard. There's
only one way to go, so I walk with
the crowd, looking intently into
every shop window as I pass for
the gift to end all gifts. Suddenly,
like a hyperactive rattlesnake on
speed, or at least industrial
strength caffeine, the crowd stops.
I walk into the woman in front, she
looks like an Olympic athlete - a
Russian shotputter to he exact. She
smiles coyly, I try to pretend not to
notice while slowly edging away. I
look past her to try to see what the
cause of the hold up is; an accident
with lots of blood and gore
perhaps? A punch up between
irate shoppers? A rush to evade
the God Squad?
No. One small group bump
into another small group and
decide to have a chat in the middle
of the pavement. Bloody Oxford
Street in the Christmas rush.

I. Jack is without weekend love-
letter for man (5)
4. Group's score is three-nil! (4)

32. Fishes the Spanish put in local

33. Utter very garbled command! (3-2)
Standing, unmoving on one of te
busiest streets in the country on
one of its busiest days, completely
oblivious to the two thousand off
fellow shoppers who wish to pass.
There aren't many things which
piss me off; crass stupidity however
is one of them.
Are these people aware that
half the world and their pet gerbil
is waiting to pass? Do they know
that, while most shoppers don't
mind queueing, we don't like
hanging around just because
they've bumped into Thomas-
Richard-Harold from Chipping
Bloody Sodbury?
What really worries me is the
frequency with which this happens
- especially if you're in a hurry. For
instance, the Sherfield Walkway is
a perfect place for groups of three
or more abreast to walk very, very
slowly while chatting. Coughing
loudly sometimes gets you past,
but for a sure fire method, just
walk so close that you literally start
breathing down their necks. For
best results, consume garlic and
cheese beforehand.
Unfortunately, I can see no
remedy to this. All I can do is
whinge on and hope the guilty will
take note, but this is a vain hope -
they're probably walking very
slowly down a narrow path right
now whilst reading this article, and
another dozen victims are added to
the list.
