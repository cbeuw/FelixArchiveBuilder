DISGUSTED
Dear Sir,
I wish to express my disgust at
the corrupt implications under-
lying the suggestive pose featured
on the back cover of the 200th
FELIX. If this is representative
of the thoughts dominating the
minds of some students in IC,
then they should cease to propa-
gate this sort of moral depravity
and concern themselves with the
more fundamental and vital issues
of life. I do not expect such
obscenity to emanate from the
minds of morally responsible
beings.
Yours sincerely,
D. J. PHILLIPS
(President ICCU)

SHOCKED
Dear Sir,
I was deeply shocked and dis-
tressed to read the article entitled
" UNDERSEXED " in the last
issue of Felix. Figures are quoted
which, if they are correct, must be
disturbing to any responsible stu-
dent of this College. The sug-
gestion that the low percentage of
students at I.C. who experience
sexual intercourse before they
graduate is due to sexual apathy
and thai this should be deplored
is disgusting.
The appearence of this article
is even more regrettable in view
of the high calibre of the reft of
the same isue of Felix. This seems
to be an example of the shallow
sensationalism recently depreca-
ted. We want Felix to become
a " newspaper with a certain
amount of dignity and one of
which the College can be proud,"
but we certainly will not achieve
this end by printing articles such
as " UNDERSEXED," especially
since a large number of students
are now living in College Halls of
Residence.
I would like to point out here
that sexual intercourse outside
marriage, i.e. fornication, is
wrong and many religions and
societies forbid it. The Christian
position is clearly stated; " You
must abstain from fornication
. . . not giving way to lust like
the pagans who are ignorant of
God " . . .• " For be very sure
of this: no one given to fornica-
tion or indecency . . . has any
share in the kingdom of Christ
and of God." (1 Thess. 4.4; Eph.
5.5. N.E.B.) The non-Christian
too must surely realise that pro-
miscuity undermines the basis of
society. If we cannot discipline
ourselves in this matter how can
we discipline ourselves in matters
of truth and liberty!
Whatever the private views of
the writer of " UNDERSEXED "
he was ill advised to publicise
them in Felix, and all self respect-
ing students of this College will, 1
feel sure, join with me in request-
ing that this type of article does
not appear in future issues of
Felix.

Dear Sir,
It must be a very immature
"Special Correspondent" (anony-
mous, of course]) who equates
interest in sex and promiscuity.
Someone should tell him (or
her!) that one doesn't have to
sleep with a girl to prove that one
is sexually attracted to her, and
that one is a real man ay shown
in " Bass " adverts.
Yours faithfully,

(Physics II)
Dear Sir,
In an age when science has
already acquired respectability
and when engineering is rapidly
following suit it seems a great
pity that this cradle of both facul-
ties should be so adolescent in its
attitudes. I choose to say ado-
lescent because the outstanding
features of one such are a
curious, groping mind and a crude
unpolished wit. On the other hand
the adult is distinguished by a
balanced critical mind and a so-
phisticated sense of humour.
As scientists or engineers we
must judge a society by its pro-
ducts. On this basis I condemn
the recent Guilds " festival of
music and culture " as a festival
of filth and as a product of under-
developed, adolescent and warped
minds. I also criticise you, Sir, for
printing that tasteless unnecessary
article entitled " Undersexed"
in your last issue. It would have
done more good to the reputation
of Felix to have left a blank space
— or perhaps to have inserted
yet another Watson profile.
DISAPPOINTED
Dear Sir,
I would like to express my dis-
appointment at the front and back
pages of the 200th edition of
Felix. The front page cartoon
depicted irresponsible b~eer^swil-
ling students—an image which
Felix has often criticised—and in
my opinion the back page was
crude and obscene and not even
funny. It is regrettable that you
were unable to find enough news
or interesting articles to fill these
pages r Why, for example, were
there no reports of the previous
week's sporting events!
Yours faithfully,
ROY ELLIS
Do not presume that this letter
is simply anti-Guilds propaganda.
Judging by the efforts of the last
two years, the Union can moisten
its lips in anticipation of the
annual offering from R.C.S. I
suppose that, true to tradition,
this will be salacious, crudely
suggestive, vile in content and
thoroughly unpalatable: in short
the products of dirty, juvenile
minds.
May I suggest that those who
need such pathetic titillation
would do better to arrange mat-
ters privately in Soho than to fur-
ther lower- the repute of the stu-
dent body of this college.
I am, Sir, yours truly,
DENNIS O'NEILL
Dear Sir,
Yesterday in the second year
physics lab, I saw a man with a
box containing five—/ repeat five
— diffraction gratings. Wh)
should anyone want to go to
America!

NEVER!
Dear Sir,
Banish Filth from the Son of
Stynx! Maybe. Banish offensive-
ness, never] Oh for a niche in the
Index Librorum Prohibitorum,
or a frown from the Bishop of
Woolwich; but instead we hast
Peter White, Roy Ellis, Old Uncle
Tom Cobley and all our solid
sober careful Christians with their
suffocating Agreed Syllabus mor-
alising.
Is not this " appeal for less
apathy ..." apocalyptically Dull]
How can we substitute filth for
humour when the humour never
existed! I thought Christains
were jolly people; so let's hear
some of this humour you believe
in, or is it just another supersti-
tion! After all, you are the salt
of the earth, not just run-of-the-
mill graceless cretins like your
fellows.
As for the Image of the College
—That's against the Second Com-
mandment]
Yours stirringly,
CHRISTOPHER MAY

Save the Tower
Dear Sir,
I hasten to correct Mr. Charles
Bagnall's leading article in your
last issue. The Queen's Tower rtnd
the Imperial Institute of which it
formed part was founded in 1887
as a national memorial of Queen
Victoria's Golden Jubilee. It was
opened to the public in 1893 as an
exhibition illustrating the resour-
ces of the Empire and with the
aim of assisting the economic de-
velopment of those resources.
There would certainly have been
no public controversy on the
architectural merits of the Queen's
Tower in 1851 (36 years before its
construction) as Mr. Bagnall sug-
gests.
7 would like to finish this letter
by adding my name to the list of
those who wish to save this fine
example of Victorian Renaissance
architecture. In 1964 public
opinion is still in a mood of re-
action against anything Victorian
but sig,is hive recently been ap-
pearing that at last this mood is
beginning to change. Succeed-
ing generaticns of I.C. Students
will be able to look more critically
and less emotionally at the
Queen's Tower and to appreciate
it not o~>.'y as an historical monu
ment bu. as a building creating
colour and interest amid the cu-
boids in which they work.
Yours sincerely,
MAX E. BARTON
