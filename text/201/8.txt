Will it all seem worthwhile
5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner & Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
- t o employ and extend his attainments to the
full.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also have a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre . . . all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one fype of career —.
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate-
assumes managerial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is, usuaf
in a modern industrial complex.

Something big is going on;
vague rumours are running round
I.C. that the Wooden Horse Club
is behind it all. What is this club
that crops up almost every week
in Felix ; that some people deem
to be a secret society ? Essentially
it is a club to promote the pinch-
ing of mascots from other colleges
and to raise money for the I.C.
Carnival by organising stunts and
commando squads. The club
started off as an underground
movement as the Union disap-
proved of mascots, and refused to
have anything to do with it.
However, with the appearance of
the newly painted Phoenix and
the official election of the Mascot
bearers, the club came out into
the open and declared its inten-
tions. Since then the club has
Iain dormant, but is now pushing
ahead rapidly, especially in the
stunts field. As far as the other
side is concerned then just hang
on and keep a tight grip on your
trousers: tnings are happening
in the Wooden Horse Club. JJ
you have any ideas for stunts, or
are willing to participate in a little
harmless enjoyment, or even
wish to raise yourself from the
apathy that surrounds I.C., then
you can do no better than con-
tact :
Bob Gordon, 9 Old Hostel.
Rick Wharton, 235 Falmouth.
Nigel Charlesworth, 221 Fal-
mouth.

THE CAKES IN SOUTHSIDE
Perhaps he is prominent in
R.C.S., yet he seems to live on
nothing but cakes. His room is
stuffed full of them, which he sells
at cut prices. There is always a
steady queue of people at his door
clamouring for them as they can-
not face Mooney-pig-food
they prefer his cut price cakes.
Is he selling them to support
himself? Or perhaps he has a
penniless girl friend at a nearby
college who has to bake and sell
them to keep herself? Or is, it
because he sells them to keep in
with the girls at Q.A.? And then
there is the question of the
money!
What is behind this mystery
that is puzzling even the elite of
Southside?
N.B.—Well, it's just that her
father makes cakes and between
them they make money. Qood
luck.
