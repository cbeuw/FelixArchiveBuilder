Dear Sir,
It was with some ap~ /tension
that I read the epistles concerning
the new "Super-de-luxe" Carni-
val magazine that we are pro-
mised. Are we to gather from
these gutteral ramifications that
bawdy humour must disappear
from its pages'? If so, I objectl
If one grants that true love,
and therefore sex, is the highest
emotion that the human race can
aspire U . then it is not surprising
that it occupies so much of the
time of philosophers, sociologists,
and anyone else who cares to use
the neglected processes of think-
ing. Ample evidence is supplied
by the numbers of authors who
have written at great length on
this subject:—Aldous Huxley—
[blindly seeking " the solution "),
Ian Fleming—(morbidly obses-
sed), and D. H. Lawrence—(the
authority) are a few examples.
As one would expect, not all
treatises on sex have been serious.
Henry Fielding, Honore de Bal-
zac, Chaucer and Shakespeare
have given us excellent examples
of hilariously funny sex stories.
Whilst not soliciting, nor con-
doning smut, bawdy humour is in
my opinion, a necessary compo-
nent of a civilised society's litera-
ture, which, if absent, would
imply a perverted attitude to sex
in that society. In the case of
Imperial College, I consider that
the Carnival magazine is a suitable
place for this form of humour.
I remain, Sir,
A "clean upstanding youth,"

Dear Sir,
We take exception to some re-
marks in Spannerama of the 2Q()th
issue. Among the usual Guilds'
breast-beating is the statement
that RCS and Mines were unpre-
pared for Morphy Day and left all
the organisation to Guilds. Until
this year Mines had played no
part in the Morphy Day rag and
were not consulted. The vice-
Presidents of RCS and Guilds met
several times to discuss plans and
arranged a complete programme.
Guilds offered to provide the
tyres and a loud-hailer; RCS pro
vided ropes and custard pies.
We can remember the appre-
hensive expression on the face of
the President of C&G when he
arrived in Bo to find 150 RCS-
men, 50 Miners, and NO Guilds-
men^. Guilds arrived late due to
police interference. At Schroter's
suggestion RCS and Guilds com-
bined to put Mines to rout. The
start of the races was delayed and
confusion arose during this time.
Guilds were happy throwing flour
over a policeman on a noddy-bike
and RCS were defending Jez.
from attack by UC andIor GEM
students. With the arrival of the
Morphy boats some order was re-
stored. The trip back was more
orderly than in previous years.
Morphy Day cannot continue
in its present form. Some time
ago RCS wrote to the other
colleges to support a round table
conference on this and other
" sport " matters. We are still
awaiting a reply.
Yours faithfully,
J. C. TYE,

Dear Sir,
We are fed up with the constant
criticisms levelled at our attire in
College publications. We do not
wear patterned sweaters with tar-
tan skirts, and rarely come into
college without make-up. The
majority of us have, and wear
}
shoes with the new chunky heels,
which we bought before the. in-
junction to do so. that appeared
in the last edition of Felix. Who
noticed?
We are certainly not the onl\<
girls who feel this w<iy. There are
many others who dress like ri.v,
and better, and if fault is f
<
> be
found with us, wlwt about the
standard of dressing attained, or
sunk to, by many men'? Scruffy
sweaters, ill-fitting jackets, dirty
shoes and lack of shaving are all
too common.
We don't mind a certain
amount of merited criticism, but
feel it Mhould not be limited to the
women of I.C.
Yours faithfully.

THIS IS SERIOUS
Let's face up to reality. Fact
one is that in a few year's time
there will be ten or eleven Halls
of Residence in I.C.. and a large
proportion of the students will be
living in College. Fact two is
that these students will spend a
large pare of their time in Hall,
and small groups of people with
similar interests will be formed
inside the Halls. Fact three is
that the Halls will play such an
important part in the College luc
that the I.C. Union will have to
play a new role in association
with them, or it will die from lack
of support. The members of I.C.
should recognise these facts now,
and start working towards a
better I.C. of the future. The
Union will have to accept that in
the Halls small groups and soc-
ieties will form which will not
fit into the larger structure of
I.C. itself. There will be con-
siderable sport played between
the Halls. Past members of Halls
who are still at I.C. will obviously
feel some attachment to the par-
ticular Hall he or she came from,
and will probably continue to
take part in many of the Hall's
activities. Eventually, freshers
will be able to choose, if they
wish, to be actively attached to a
particular Hall, with the probable
view to spending at least one
year in that Hall. Sporting acti-
vities between Halls will probably
be only concerned with the major
sports, and I.C. will run only two
top teams in these sports. It will
then be more of an honour to
play for I.C. A final fact is that
the Constituent Colleges will
rapidly lose their relevance and
importance. Lets' face up to
reality.

BARMAIDS
Rumours about a S.S. barmaid,
which confused even Felix are
due to the fact tint several appli-
cants, some fsmaJe, have been
considered as extra bar staff. The
barmaid seen on Monday night
was just helping out for that night.
