R.C.S. UNION MEETING
Thursday 6th
The usual business was carried
out, and at the end President
Chris Tye confronted C. S. Evans,
Trophy Officer, with the charge
that he had become a reformed
character. C. S. Evans affirmed
that he had ceased to indulge in
rowdy and irresponsible beha-
viou. He called for an end to
immaturity and obscure songs,
particularly at freshers dinners.

C A R N I V A L WAKING UP
Four gentlemen walking round
the Albert Hall with a ladder on
the night of Jan. 30th were set
upon by watchmen and Alsations.
As a result of this test of the
defences it was decided to aban-
don the project of raising a car
above the congestion. The flash-
ing police beacon that appeared
in Princes Gardens at 3.00 a.m.
that night may have been con-
nected with this, but police who
later came across three gentlemen
carrying a ladder down Exhibition
Road were persuaded otherwise.

record total. The Carnival com-
mittee are very grateful to the
company for their wonderful
gesture. It's up to you to make
it a great success.
Further details later.

Food for the gourmet, music
for the discerning. Carnival
lunches began last Friday. The

more would be appreciated.
Where else can you drink and dine
with the superb aura of luxury
and" gentle sounds of jazz that is
I.C. Concert Hall each Friday
from now until the end of term.
Commandos are required for
stunts. Last years major stunt
was a raid on the Royal Festival

in the Concert Hall and before
the show there will be a buffet
supper.
The International Evening is
scheduled for Wednesday, May

dancing.
This is the one night of the
year when the Union is open wide
to the miscellany of nationalities
and cultures that surround the
natives. Organised by the Inter-
national Relations Club this
promises to be the most interest-
ing event of Carnival Week.
Saturday May 9th is procession
and Garden Fete day, Ideas for
floats are needed as are volunteers
to build them. Let's see a bit
more of the inter-college rivalry.
Each college should be able to
manage at least six floats each.
The Garden Fete will be accom-
panied by a display of Veteran
cars in Princes' Gardens. Each
Union club and society are asked
to provide one stall each. Would
p-esidents of clubs please drop
into the Carnival Office and leave
promises and ideas so that plan-
ning can continue.
The last night of Carnival is a
ball with Humphrey Littleton and
the Hustlers. The student dance
to end them all, the last fling
before the June exams. Any
