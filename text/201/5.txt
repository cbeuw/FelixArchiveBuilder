Felix
This column will appear after
the Union Meeting on 18th Feb-
, ruary, when the whole problem of
Felix and the Executive will be
history. The main dispute arises
out of the pig headed behaviour
both of Mr. Watson, the Union
President and Mr. Combes, the
editor of Felix. The attitude of
the President is summed up by
his letter in the last edition of this
newspaper and his inconclusive
motion to the Union Meeting
C0LCUTT
which leaves him scope only for a
personal attack on Mr. Combes,
who remains adamant and indig-
nant. It seems that neither will
give an inch, despite the efforts of
the rest of the Felix board, whc
are all agreed that the dispute
could easily be settled. I suspect
that even Mr. Massey, despite
what the President thinks, is in
favour of settling the dispute with-
out a battle. The battle must
result, in either the loss of a
President, who stands high in the
scale of competence, when his ac-
tions are viewed overall, or the
loss of an excellent newspaper
structure, built up by Mr. Combes
and his staff, or in nothing, which
is by no means unlikely. The
first two results would be deplor-
able and the third would leave the
situation unsettled. I will be sur-
prised if anything comes of the
battle, despite the two steaming
contestants.
Union
It would seem that people at
I.C. fall between the two limits,
which I would call " Sportmen "
and " Socialmen." The sportmen
are defined as those who accom-
plish a reasonable amount without
thinking too much and the social-
men are defined as those who
think too much and accomplish
little. In past years the running of
the Union was entrusted to those
inclined towards the sportmen
side, and a general outcry was
raised against the alcoholic ex-
cesses of some of them. This year
the running of the Union has been
entrusted to those biased to the
other side and we have not seen
any marked improvement in the
state of affairs, despite what the
socialmen predicted. In fact, if
one listens to the comments of
some of the college staff and
admin people it would seem that
they suffer from foot in mouth
disease more than their predeces-
sors. The ideal of course would
be someone like the late Kitch-
ener, one time President of the
Union who combined the charac-
ters of both sportmen and social-
men to just the right degree, but
ideals as everyone knows are sel-
dom attainable. In the light of
this some would say that sport-
men are preferrable.
Comment
It seems to be all the rage these
days for Felix staff to use their
second Christian name when writ-
ing in the newspaper. No prizes
V O L U N T A R Y SERVICE
OVERSEAS
VoluntQry Service Overseas (Graduate Division)
offers to selected volunteers, willing to spend
at least a year overseas after obtaining
their qualification, the opportunity to
help fill the urgent need for trained men and
women in the developing countries of the
Commonwealth and elsewhere.
This is a chance for you to see something of
the world and to make use of your initiative
and talent where it is most needed.
The majority of projects are for teachers
in secondary-level schools, though there are also
likely to be posts in Universities, Training
Colleges. and hospitals; in agriculture,
administrative and social services and
in engineering projects.
You will need a degree, diploma, or similar
professional qualification, good health, and
enthusiasm. For further details consult
your Appointments Officer, or write
direct to ;

ior the identity of Charles Bagnall
and James Walker. The article
"Birdsnest," which I am informed
is based on observations of the
moon, seems to be raising indig-
nation amongst our well groomed
young ladies. Many readers of
the last issue of Felix marvelled at
the picture of Father Ivor appar-
ently defying the laws of gravity.
I will explain that he is shown
turning in the narrow road outside
Southside on his scooter, which
has been omitted from the photo-
graph. Congratulations on the
excellent supplement from Elec-
trical Engineering, to whoever
really inspired it. At present some
confusion seems to exist as to
who should get the credit. Babb?
Combes ? Schroter ? At last a
Spannerama, which does not in-
sult the intelligence of its readers.
HAPPY... STRANGE.
UNIQUE.
SERVICE OVERSEAS
R e w a r d i n g
" Thank you for sending me out
to one of the happiest, strangest,
most unique, at times frustrating,
but utterly unforgettable years I
think I shall ever spend." Thus
wrote a girl graduate, one ot the
thirty-six pioneers who went to
Africa in 1962. Voluntary Service
Overseas has been helping boys
and girls of 18 and over to spend
a year overseas before going up to
University since 1958, but 1962
was the (first year of the new
Scheme for graduates and other
qualified people to do the same.
" Happy . . strange . . unique."
in some ways, she was lucky,
being posted to one of the brand-
new African Universities, and
helping to build up the framework
of a young nation's higher educa-
tion, virtually from scratch. The
igreat majority of posts under the
Scheme are straightforward teach-
ing jobs in secondary schools,
which demand the same continual
routine lesson-preparation and,
sometimes, slavery to a syllabus,
as work in an English school.
For all that, the volunteers find it
rewarding work.
D e m a n d
Obviously there is no shortage
of work. The demand, for some
time to come, will always exceed
the supply. This is not t^ say
that there are not enough candi-
dates coming forward (though
physically there must be a limit),
nor that V.S.O.'s standards of
selection are impossibly high; the
the restricting factor is financial.
The host government shoulders
half the total cost of each volun-
teer's year overseas; they give him
board and accommodation and
the equivalent of £3 a week pocket
money, or if this is not possible,
a payment-in-lieu out of which
the volunteer pays his own rent,
buys his food, and employs his
houseboy. This is not the bare
subsistence level which most
people expect as " volunteers,"
but it is far less than the expatriate
teacher on contract is paid.
The rest of the money needed
to send a volunteer overseas—the
cost of travel, clothing and equip-
ment grants, training, administra-
tion, and the small terminal grant
given to each volunteer—has to
be found in this country. Half of
the money (some £650 a head)
comes from V.S.O.'s voluntary
contributors and the British Gov-
ernment, through the Department
of Technical Co-operation, has
agreed to pay the other half,
matching the voluntary contribu-
tions pound for pound.
The great need is for teachers.-
V.S.O. only send volunteers to
countries which ask for them, and
of course, they must supply what
is wanted.
Difficulties
It is easy to emphasise the
romantic aspects and forget the
many and considerable difficul-
ties—the heat and humidity, the
continual necessity of warding off
disease, the overall impact of a
completely different way of life.
" It soon transpired that I would
be the only Physics master... as
my degree was in P.P.E., this was
evidently going to be something of
a Herculean task;" " The School
has no running water, the electri-
city isn't working " at the mo-
ment " and is 60 miles from the
nearest European-type shopping
centre." And on top of teaching,
volunteers take on the organisa-
tion of every conceivable kind of
club and activity in and out of
school, to such an extent that one
claims he is working an 18-hour
day. And yet they still have time
to write saying: " I am enjoying
myself here very much."
Neither V.S.O. or Britain are
alone in this field.the U.S. peace
corps and the United Nations are
also pioneering, as well as any
others. All are doing the best they
can to meet the urgent need for
trained men and women in under
developed countries; V O L U N -
TEERS A R E NEEDED NOW.
