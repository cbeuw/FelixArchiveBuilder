CQLCUTT'S F O L L Y
Arising from Bill McAuley's
strange allusions in " Phoenix "
to the Colcutt Tower, there has
sprung a new wave of controversy
throughout the College. How-
ever, this is not the first time that
the subject has been discussed.
Six years ago, comment raged
furiously in Felix's columns for
many weeks as a result of the
following headline appearing on
the front page of nn issue early in
the year. " A QUARTER OF A
MILLION POUNDS FOR COL-
CUTT'S FOLLY." One corre-
spondent claimed that this was a
concession to VICTORIAN SEN-
TIMENTALISM while another
argued that a pit 280 ft. deep be
provided so that the Tower could
be sunk into it, with hydraulic
lifting gear available so that it
could be displayed on ceremonial
occasions. Another letter con-
tained the suggestion that
£250,000 was far too small an
amount to spend on the tower.
"Why not," he said "concentrate
the resources of Imperial College
on to producing a L E A N I N G
TOWER OF SOUTH K E N -
SINGTON. After all who would
have heard of the leaning tower
of Pisa if it had been straight."
One Union meeting was spent
discussing whether a miniature
Colcutt should be constructed to
serve as a Union mascot for rag
days, but this was (unfortun-
ately?) defeated.
MORPHY DAYS
These rag days seemed to have
changed very little with time. On
one memorable occasion the
Police had to admit that the
arrested men (Guildsmen) had
been picked out at random, and
the Magistrate had no alternative
but to discharge them, which he
did.
THE STATE OF T H E UNION
The issues of Felix for the last
ten or so years ago all carry
accounts of the depressed state of
the Union, and the efforts of each
successive President to remedy
this. Council meetings appear to
B R O W N B A G G E R
B R O U G H
have been very much the same—
" highly ridiculous." The Sol-
lowing momentous decision was
reached at a Council meeting in
May 1957. It was finally decided
to allow I.C.W.A. to purchase a
fish tank to put in their lounge."
The stirrers, however, were active
even then. They pointed out that
the mortality of fish was very
high.
TTie cry of many students that
the Union itself should be respon-
sible for electing its President is
a weak one m comparison even
with the whisper that Felix has
carried in its time that the. Rector
himself should be elected by the
students.
Union card checks are not new.
These were carried out seven
years ago, and met with a reason-
ably quiet response. This augers
well for Council's latest which
may go through without much
protest.
PHOENIX has been through
rough times with a crisis in 1959
when the Editor was dismissed
due to his unwillingness to co-
operate with the Board of Direc-
tors. The Debating Society, on
the other hand, has seen better
times. Even as recently as 1959
an I.C. team won the U.L.U.
Debating Compttition. Attend-
ances at debates were high, and
good outside speakers were being
attracted to the College. This
surely shows that there is a place
for Debating at I.C.
The College powers are almost
synonomous witTi the College
itself and they have of course,
been subjected to many a stormy
attack from (Felix's columnists.
The domestic Bursar has been
particularly prone but we would
like, now, however to record one
of his triumphs i.e. the occasion
on which he put down poison in
the Union, which lead to a mouse
actually being caught in the bar.
For this, and his other glories,
he was re-awarded in the Felix
honours of 1961, the Charles
Atlas award for posture. One
wonders how he and others re-
acted on the occasion when a baby
was found some years back, in the

Beit Quadrangle late one evening.
Profiles have appeared regularly,
and many have been duplicated,
for example the Union treasurer,
K. E . Weale, seems to be a
particular favourite. Mrs. Robb's
criterion for his efficiency is the
fact that she had to wail five years
to cadge a sherry out of him.
LIGHTER SIDE
On the lighter side, concern was
once expressed at the amount of
snogging carried out in Union
lounge and this followed by the
suggestion that the Felix room
would be more suitable.
Felix has carried many letters
criticising it for being shabby,
sensationalistic and a whole host
of other things, but be this as it
may, when the occasion has de-
manded it, Felix's reporting has
been very mature, for example,
the Obituary appearing in Felix
for Air Chief Marshall Sir
Roderic Hill, in October 1954
was very well written.
Felix may well have a stormy
period ahead of it, but we feel
confident that whatever happens,
Felix will emerge triumphant
complete with his usual resplen-
dent grin.

The Next Union Meeting
"This house believes that Mem-
bers of City and Guilds Union
should concentrate their activities
more within that Union, than
within the Imperial College
Union." This will be the main
motion on the floor of the meet-
ing, which will be held in Room
542 Mech. Eng, on Thursday,
27th Feb. starting at 1.15 p.m.
It'll Be H e l l . . .
Nympferno, or " To hell with
you," the Guilds-mines Carnival
will occur on the evening of Fri-
day, 28th Feb. Tickets are on
sale at the Union price 25s. 6d.
with 6d. reduction for students.
There will be four or five bands
around . . . Saracens, Shadies,
Paul London, Bonzo Band, and
possibly some lads from the
"Pool." We hope to set the
Union into an inferno. Fancy
dress helps most.

Luis Bunuel's controversial film
" VIRIDIANA," which won the
Palme D'Or at Cannes in 1961
and was subsequently banned in
France and Spain (where it was
made), will be shown on February
28th.
STARTLING
After the startling and success-
ful carol concert of last term, the
choir is to perform the Bach B
Minor Mass a little nearer home,
in the R.C.M. Concert Hall, on
March 13th.
The Carol Concert was at the
Hammersmith Town Hall and
created a certain amount of com-
ment since a half hour work by
Honegger concluded the first half
of the concert and was repeated in
full as the second half.
The choir is shaping up to the
Bach very adequately at the mo-
ment, and with an orchestra raised
from professional places the per-
formance should be well worth-
while. We are assured that the
work is to be played only once in
the evening.
