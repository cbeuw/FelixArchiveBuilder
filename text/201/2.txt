Mr. ULMrMWUl
There can be few students at
this College who remain un-
affected by the work of Mr. Mc-
Dowall. His responsibility is wide-
spread; the welfare of overseas
students, the organisation of Com-
memoration Day, and the running
of General Studies and Touch-
stone.
Mr. McEtowall joined the Col-
lege's Administrative Staff in 1949
after a unique procedure of 36
hours of examinations and inter-
views. Until then, his career had
encompassed many fields; he was
educated at Eton and Balliol Col-
lege, Oxford, where he took
Modern Greats. He worked for
Unilever—on the Times editorial
staff—taught at Lancing and
Stowe—served on the General
Staff as Education Officer in Ger-
many. Not long after coming to
the College the then Rector
Sir Roderic Hill, who had started
Touchstone weekends in 1950,
persuaded the Board of Studies to
start General Studies in 1952.
He is directly concerned, al-
though behind the scenes, with
two tnportant problems facing
the College. Aproximately one
third of I.C. students come from
overseas, many from countries
desperately short of men of their
training. Their welfare is essential
and Mr. McDowall, as secre-
tary to the Committee on Over-
seas students, tries to help them to
get used to the discomforts that a
change of climate and custom
imposes. However he finds that
some expect too much attention
from the English students who are
already busy and preoccupied.
Recent years have seen much
talk about the two cultures. I.C.
has attempted to alleviate the
effects of increasing intensive
specialisation by Touchstone and
General Studies.
To provide five speakers each
week for twenty weeks of the year
is no small undertaking. Some are
obtained under the auspices of the
College Societies, however much
is left to the personal endeavours
of Mr. McDowall. When asked
how he obtained the various and
numerous speakers he replied, " I
just write to them, sometimes they
come, sometimes they don't."
Many of those to whom he writes,
are well known personalities of
radio and T.V. Often such people
are too busy, but some welcome
the opportunity to visit a College
so near to the centre of London.
College connections with the
University and with industry are
most helpful.
It is inevitable that not all the
subjects covered by General
Studies pack a lecture theatre.
They are not expected to do this,
nor to provide a deep study of the
subject, but rather to stimulate a
new or encourage an existing in-
terest. The success of a given lec-
ture depends to a large degree on
the lecturer. He can transform a
potentially uninteresting subject or
ruin a good one—a fact of which
Mr. McDowell is only too well
aware. He is worried by the lack
of scope for any active participa-
tion and so regards Touchstone
discussion weekends as more im-
portant than lectures; and as
anyone who has been to Silwood
Park wilj agree, a mid-term
weekend away from London is
most refreshing.
Silwood Park provides a re-
laxed atmosphere in which one
can advance ones own theories on
a subject of topical interest and
uphold them, or watch them being
ripped to pieces; for surely the
power of argument must be an
integral part of any education.
The accommodation and the
number of weekends possible are
limited, but Mr. McDowall would
like to extend the Touchstone ap-
proach to General Studies. Now
that the College has more resi-
dents he would like to see groups
gather to discuss a given lecture,
perhaps with the speaker himself.
He regards the formation of dis-
cussion groups as one of the im-
portant roles that the Halls could
fulfill. It is this type of activity
which will help break down the
water tight compartments which
Still pervade South Side. He is
anxious that as full a use as pos-
sible be made of the opportunities
that the Halls offer. It is. strange
that so many people are worried
by the neglect of internal develop-
ments in the Halls and yet so little
is done, that they remain virtually
unused.
Mr. McDowalPs work is essen-
tial to the College. Many of the
CA.T.'s possess a complete
department devoted to General
Studies. I.C., one of the foremost
scientific institutions in the coun-
try, does not. On what is its
future reputation to rest?

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like9
the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU—-and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
