The first Union meeting this term will have been held yesterday,
a Tuesday. This choice of date is strange. On Tuesday most third
year Guilds students go to L.S.E. Excluding lunch, they still find
it difficult to be bac': at I.C. before 1.30 p.m. Most of them will
want to eat sometime, and so will probably choose to miss the Union
Meeting. Further, by holding the meeting on the Tuesday, the
Executive have robbed Felix of the chance to discuss, publicis ^nd
comment on the motions before the House, before they are resolved.
In fact, Felix is being deprived of the chance of informing the Union
about its own affairs.
The only reasons given for this odd choice of date by the Secre-
tary were (a) the Bishop of Woolwich will be talking the previous
Thursday, and (b) a full month is required before the next Union
meeting.
Nothing but an act of God (or the pro-Rector), can cause term
to end before Friday, 20th March; this meeting could easily have
been held on Thursday and still leave a clear month before the next
one. Very odd !

Mr. Schroter read a letter from
the National Mental Health Ap-
peal thanking Guilds for the £135
that had been raised during the
year. He then gave a summary of
the findings of the Working Party,
so that they could be considered
prior to the important I.C.G.U.M.
Mr. Wise was congratulated for
organising the successful Engin-
eers Dinner Dance, and Mr. Col-
lins and Mr. Beattie were con-
gratulated in the fields of swim-
ming and amateur radio. Three
pints of beer were produced. One
contained a quadruple vodka. Mr.
Beattie enjoyed the Union Meet-
ing.
A heap of grotty rags wearing
a smart top hat, stirred in the
corner. It was Yog masquerading
as a small ghost. A n aperture for
face spoke of the need for material
for the Guilds Carnival Cabaret.
The material that he had was a bit
thin. Leg showed. And the Car
Parking Survey was mentioned.
Festival of Music and Culture
Three experts in the field were
present, Mr. Dowley, Mr.
Throsby, and Dr. Allen. They
were each given a cigarette packet
upon which to record their.judge-
ments. The first item was Chess
Boardy. It was the only script
that had not been screened by
the management; a last minute
entry. Apologies are offered to
all that were offended. It is dif-
ficult to draw lines without a ruler.
Elec. One produced an art criti-
cism, as given by a M . Bidet, a
well known French footbath. He
explained how Constable should
have painted the Haywain, but
left us in the dark when he drew
his conclusions. After some elec-
trical plumbing, sound emanated
from three Electrical guitarists
from three electrical. A murky
character in a maroon jacket was
observed to be grovelling on the
floor, holding several pieces of
wire in close contact, in order that
sound might continue to emanate.
A short judicial conference pro-
nounced First Electrical First, and
Second Electrical Second. The
four carnival tickets, and W.C.
Pot were disposed of. M . Bidet
and friend uttered grateful thanks.
Likewise Schroter to judges.
. The new and glorious Spanner
was brought forth for inaugura-
tion. It was suggested that
Spanner be done in Orange
Squash by one well knowmfor such
consumption. Milk, Champagne,
and water were also refused,
and after a sprinkling ql beer
(Jones had consumed the rest) the
meeting closed with Bob Booma-
lacking.

I was glad to see that the spell
of fine weather that began a
fortnight ago encouraged many
students to venture out for a
lunchtime walk to see Albert and
get a breath of fresh air, rather
than sitting in the ICWA lounge
perusing Readers' Digest and
talking " shop ". A short walk
a day (weather permitting!) is ar
exceptionally good idea, particu-
larly at this time of the year wher
the effects of the winter are begin
ning to make themselves notice
able on the female form-pudding
induced plumpness and indooi
pallor need to be fought now if
you are to be looking your best
for the Spring. (If you are feeling
smug about this, take a long, hard
look in a full-length mirror ... . )
However, the means are at hand
—do not despair Mr. Moonie's
soups and salads—no chips! —
when lunching in College. They
are reasonably cheap and nourish-
ing, and will enable you to lose
that spurious inch and improve
your complexion before the end
of term.

Somethng navy will be indis-
pensible to any girl's wardrobe
this summer and the ideal practi-
cal answer is a terylene, box-
pleated skirt. Pans says pleats.
Paris says navy. M & S speil
economy. A permanently pleated
skirt keeps its looks through wear-
ing and washing—and sitting for
hours! —and dark blue is a colour
that has all the advantages of
black without being so sombre for
the summer: As navy skirt and a
colourful blouse or lightweight
sweater make a twosome that you
can wear to College everyday and
by ringing the changes on blouse
or jersey you will have an ever-
smart outfit that is high fashion at
low price. And navy is so versa-
tile—team it with pink (a com-
bination for which West End
shops have gone overboard) lime
green, emerald, aquamarine,
mauve, coral, citrus yellow, burnt
orange or wear it with ever-
popular white and the winter's red
accessories.
OBITUARY
The tragic news of his suicide
came as a shock to the friends of
the I.C. Iraqi student, S. Hussein,
though they had known for some.;
time that all had not been well I
with him. The eldest son, Hussein
came to England two and a half'
years ago to study for his A-levels ]
at Gloucester Technical College.
He did not go home during this
time and had no close relations in
England. His friends found him
quiet and pleasant to talk to, and
in his spare time he did some
painting and reading.
Two and a half weeks before
the end of the Xmas term, Hus-
sein stopped attending lectures,
tutorials and Laboratory sessions,
and he did not take the end of
term exam. At about this time
he seems lo have moved from
his single room in Queen's Gate,
but he gave his friends a false new
address. He was still absent
during the first week of this term,
and the College wrote to him
asking why he had not taken the
exam and also why he had not
registered for the University
exams. The letter was returned
to the College, as apparently he
was not at the Queen's Gate
address. During this first week his
friends at College told the Iraqi
Embassy about his absence, and
one even went to the Home Office
to try and find out his address.
He was told that the address was
confidential. The Embassy then
wrote a letter, but this too was re-
turned. During all this time he
was only seen a couple of times in
I.C., watching T.V. in the Union,
and he could not be found at his
usual address. Two weeks went
by and no action was taken by
either the College or the Embassy,
then on January 27th Hussein
tried to gas himself in the Queen's
Gate room. -The Landlord dis-
covered the attempt and 'phoned
the Embassy. That evening an
Embassy official came round to
see Hussein, but he denied the
attempt and claimed that it was
an accident. The following day,
when the landlord was out, Hus- <
sein gassed himself. His friends at
I.C. heard about it on the 30th
and sent a telegram to his parents
the next dav.
