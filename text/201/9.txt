Guys 0 — I.C. 2
I.C. showed that they had been taking it easy in' previous rounds
by outplaying an efficient Guys Hospital team at Berrylands in their
U.C. Cup semi-final. The final against either L.S.E. or Q.M.C. now
seems only a formality before the cup returns to South Kensington
for the sixth successive year.

The first shot of the match
came from inside right Colin
Casemore when he hit the ball
hard and just over the bar in the
6th minute. Guys immediately
retaliated and for several minutes
play centered about the I.C.
penalty area. Shots went wide,
however, and Jim Ingram in goal
was not unduly worried.
IRON DEFENCES
Play swung freely from end to
end for the rest of the first half
with little chance of anything but
a breakaway goal piercing the two
iron defences and with Guys look-
ing the more likely to score it.
The closest they came to it,
however, was when a sizzling shot
from their centre forward went
just the wrong side of the upright
in the 20th minute, and as the
last minutes before the interval
ticked away it was I.C. who
started taking the initiative and
showing their class in a series of
raids on the Guys goal.
H.T. GUYS 0—I.C. 0
At half time the game was still
very much in the balance, but
I.C. showed the shape of things to
come when, in the second minute
after the re-start, right back Steve
Fisher appeared in the penalty
area to head a high cross hard,
inches over the bar.
Guys were still threatening to
break through whenever they got

On Wednesday, January 15th
we sent our 1st team to Sandhurst
(always an excellent opportunity
to see how the other half lives)
who, as was expected, defeated us
by 28 pts. to 52; which score
might have been far greater but
for the assistance of Graham
Tilly, I.C.C.C.C. captain of seve-
ral years ago, who came second.
That day it was also our turn
to organise the league II match.
Finding enough people to. help
with a race of nearly 100 runners
badly depleated our third team,
but with the excellent heijp of
Tony Bigg—a new discovery—we
did better than expected.
The following Saturday (18th)
we had an away race against
Leeds and Birmingham Universi-
ties but got no more than 80 miles
along the A l before we were
beaten back by fog.
A four-way home match with
Royal Vets. U.C., and Westmin-
the ball, but in the 49th minute it
was the Hospital goal post which
shook to an I.C. shot and in the
54th their goalkeper was forced
to make a brilliant close save from
an I.C. corner.
G O A L No. 1
A minute later, centre forward
Denny Vaughan latched on to a
through pass from Keith Stoddart
and put an economizing lob over
the head of the advancing goal-
keeper and into the net on the
third bounce.
This relieved the I.C. team of a
great burden and they Started to
play a more relaxed brand of
football, threatening to over-run
Guys time after time as the Col-
lege forwards swept in towards
goal. For the first time, the
University men seemed to be play-
ing up to their own standard
rather than to that of the hospital.
It Wi-i almost 20 minutes before
Guys managed to work another
serious shot at goal, but then, in
two dangerous attacks, they were
thwarted by the ability of Ingram.
G O A L No. 2
Guys never really looked like
scoring again, however, and in
the 86th minute, a well taken goal
by Stoddart from a Casemore
cross gave I.C. victory by a mar-
gin which reflected their perform-
ance more fairly.
ster Coll. Oxford, was easily won
by U.C. with I.C. 2nd. Inter-
national Peter Yates (U.C.), run-
ning virtually alone, won in a
great new record time |for the
course of 26m. 43secs.
The Q.M.C. 7im. was our
next run, but owing to some du-
bious marking it became nearer
3Jm. and was declared null and
void—I bet Bristol and Leeds en-
joyed the joke as much as we did.
After beating Guy's on the
Wednesday we travelled to Hamp-
stead on Saturday 1st for the
U.C.. Invitation where we came
11th and took our revenge on
Sandhurst in the process.
R U G B Y
Seventy-two (72), nil; I.C. flat-
tened R.A.F. Kenley last Wed-
nesday, Turner scored 27 points
all to himself of which 12 were
the result of his conversion kicks.
This is claimed to be a club
record.
M I X E D H O C K E Y
It had to happen. The mixed
team has lost its first match at
last. 4-0 down with ten minutes
to go, I.C. got three quick goals,
but the visitors added one more
before time to make the final score
5-3.
RUGBY
A welcome addition to the club
is the Silwood Park XV who,
unfortunately, lost their first game
against a strong mixed l.C. team.
WATER POLO
The water polo teams have
been hitting in the goals just re-
cently. Among their more con-
vincing victories have been those
against Sandhurst (16-0), South-
ampton Univ. (14-3), and Read-
ing Univ. (12-1).
H O C K E Y
What a mix-up! I.C. arrived
at N.C.L's. ground to find no
umpire, no oranges and no beer.
Obviously perturbed by all this
our team only managed a goalless
draw—against nine men.

It's the biggest thing of its kind
in Europe, if not in the world.
It's our own—we organise it. If s

starting at 3.0 p.m. this Satur-
day by the Lido south of the Ser-
pentine.
Ist XV took the opportunity of a
vacant Wednesday to start train-
ing for the U.L. seven-a-side
competition.
WATER POLO
AH three divisions of the
U.L.U. league are now lead by
I.C. teams and our first team sup-
plies four U.L.U. players, includ-
ing two goalkeepers, one of
whom plays in attack.
SOCCER
I.C. are still, statistically, cap-
able of avoiding relegation. They
won yet another league match 2-1
against U.C. last Wednesday with
the help of two of their U . L .
players.
RUGBY
The match against Shrivenham
was lost to a hotly disputed pe-
nalty in the last two minutes.
However, the opposition then laid
on 500 pints of the beer with the
result that several players failed
to make breakfast the following
morning.
SWIMMING
The swimming club have lost
only two matches this year, these
being against Birmingham and
Sandhurst.
H O C K E Y
Guilds beat R.C.S. 2-0 last
Wednesday and so may well gain
promotion to the premier U.L.
league and play against I.C. 1st
XI next season. Some members
of the team feel that they should
not accept promotion if it is
offered, however.
fJABLE OF ffAGlNS
Tony Richards scored 22 points
in one game while in an alcoholic
haze; John Hall, in a fit of
drunken gaiety, split open the
head of captain Cunningham with
a graceful swing of his right knee
(\Look\ I've got blood on my
knee). Sad to report, the seem-
ingly invincable ffagins suffered a
severe reverse in the next match
to the tune of 25-8.
As usual, there are several
international athletes competing.
John 13 alter, Britain's fastest
ever half-miler, should be running
for Bristol University, and D. M .
Turner (Queen's College Cam-
bridge) Tim Johnson, (Trinity
College Cambridge), and John
Farrington and Pete Yates (Uni-
versity College) all international
cross-country runners will be
there.
Manchester University have,
lost most.of their successful team,
and are unlikely to repeat their
easy win of last year. However,
the winner is likely to come again
from one of the northern Univer-
sities, unless University College or
Borough Road Training College
can, bring the Sir Roderic Hill
Cup back-to London.
This is always a spectacular
event, so if you are thinking of
coming to watch, why not first
contact this year's chief organiser,
John Periera at room 327 in
South Side—we need plenty of
time-keepers and recorders to
keep an event of this size running
smoothly.
