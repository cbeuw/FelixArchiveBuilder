Ladies Rugby reveal
all on TV tonight!
IC's Ladies Rugby team are once more making the national
media. Their form both on the field and in the after-match bath
can be seen this week on the Six O'Clock Show on L W T .
IC's girls beat Q M C Ladies team 8 points to 4 i n a match
played last week at Harlington. Then they plaved a seven-a-side
match against a team of I C men, the B2s, drawing four all.
The action was recorded by cameras from the light-hearted
magazine programme, who were invited along by I C Ladies'
captain Maribell Anderson.
After the games the thirty ladies retired to the extremely large
bath in the changing rooms. Their modesty suitably protected
by large quantities of foam the T V camera? were allowed in to
interview them. A few of the men present were invited to join
them in the bath, but for some reason they all declined the offer!
Estates Cock up Pipe
in Refectory Fiasco
The Estates Office at IC received
criticism from the Refectories
Section this week after installing
a new pipe in the kitchen in
Southside Refectory, running
from floor to ceiling.
When plans for the pipe were
first drawn up, M r Mooney
insisted that a three-sided
wooden shield be placed around
the pipe to prevent contamina-
tion of the kitchen area. Estates
agreed and installed the large
wooden duct taking up more
than thirty square feet of floor
space.
They then put in the nine inch
red pipe—some distance outside
the wooden duct!
There are, at present, no plans
to remove the redundant wooden
duct. The siting of the pipe is such
that refectory staff are obliged to
ram it with their trolleys as they
pass.

Estatesfiascos please send them to
me via the FELIX Office-Ed.)
God Exists-Official
IC students decided, by only a
small majority, that God exists.
At a Debsoc debate on Tuesday
an attentive audience heard
Andrew Pettman propose that
there was enough evidence to
believe that God exists. Chris
Barton vigorously opposed the
motion, suggesting that belief in
God was merely the result of
some people's insecurity, he did
not however include himself in
this group. After a series of
q u e s t i o n s , a n d s e v e r a l
interruptions in Chris Barton's
summing-up, the motion was
narrowly carried.
Elections-the Writing
is on the Wall
The Union elections committee
has withdrawn its ban on outside
printing of publicity for the
s a b b a t i c a l elections. The
committee had decided that all
printing had to be done on
F E L I X or U n i o n Office
equipment, as reported in last
week's F E L I X . After complaints
from a number of candidates that
they had been given insufficient
notice of this decision, the
committee withdrew the ruling.
The ruling was designed to
prevent the recurrence of the
situation last year when a
candidate had high quality
posters printed at an outside
printers but produced only an
extremely modest receipt
(disgraceful!-Ed). The elections
committee still intends to be strict
in its enforcement of election
expenses, which it has set at £50.
The committee has also
decided that votes marked with
an X will not be counted, only
those with the regulation 1 by the
candiate of first choice will count.
Nominations for the four
sabbatical posts close at 5:30pm
today. At the time of going to
press candidates had been
nominated for all posts, but one
post was still uncontested. The
names of candidates and their
manifestos will appear in next
week's F E L I X .
Guilds still without Shie
The Guilds U G M on Tuesday
was a rather low-key affair. There
had been a rumour that visitors
from University College were
expected, but none of them
appeared, which from their point
of view was probably just as well,
since Spanner and Bolt were
nowhere in sight. Guilds excuse
was that the car bringing the
mascot to the meeting had
broken down. However, it is
widely believed that, fearing a
mascotry raid at the sparsely
attended U G M they decided not
to bring the mascot. As it turned
out, the only minor disturbance
was caused by a few inquisitive
individuals from RCS.
Meanwhile, Guilds are still
without one of their shields
following the raid by U C students
three weeks ago. U C Union is
apparently still searching for the
shield, which is believed to be in
the possession of an individual
student who is refusing to return
it. They have agreed to pay for
damage caused by the raid.
Black Day at IC
Dramsoc's Black Corned};, directed by Raj Singh went down very
well with enthusiastic audiences on Wednesday and Thursday
night in the Union Concert Hall. Black Comedy is a contemporary
farce by Peter Schaffer about a young sculptor who has invited a
rich German millionaire to see his work, not knowing that his
fiance has invited her awful father to meet him on the same day. To
complicate the plot further the lights blow and the characters are
in darkness. The play was well performed by a small and talented
cast and serves as an aperitif to Dramsoc's major production of
Galileo later this term.
