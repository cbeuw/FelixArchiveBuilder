BRUCE KENT: CHRISTIANITY AND CND
FELIX: Most IC students only
know of your role in C N D ,
however you were University of
London chaplain at the end of the
sixties. How do you think the
University Nas changed?
Monsigno. Kent: It's very diffi-
cult to say. The chaplaincy has
definitely grown. M y impression
of student life as a whole is that in
1968 it was very active. Since then
it has varied greatly. At the
moment it seems very conserva-
tive.
"To be involved in
peace is essential if
you are a Christian"
FELIX: How much interest did
you have in disarmament as a
student at Oxford?
Kent: When I was a student I
was totally apathetic. I did all the
normal things. I didn't question
the lectures I was given or
challenge the structure in any
way. I had no original ideas that I
can remember.
FELIX: So when did you actually
become involved in CND?
Kent: I was influenced by a Jesuit
Archbishop, Thomas Roberts in
1963/4 and the Nigerian war of]
1969/70 really made me political-
ly aware.
FELIX: After joining C N D how
did you actually become general
secretary?
Kent: I think C N D was so pleased
to find a priest who was
interested that I was pushed
forward to various positions and
finally became a member of C N D
general council.
FELIX: Why do you think C N D
has regained its influence as a
major national political force?
Kent: It was not because of me or
any other member of C N D , but
because of outside influences
such as the stupidities of the
British and the American
governments' new weapon
systems.
FELIX: D o you see any conflict
between being general secretary
of C N D and a Catholic priest?
Kent: Not in the slightest. I think
that to be involved in peace is
essential if you are a Christian.
As a priest I don't think I take a
party political view and I try to
encourage non-violence and love.

Monsignor Bruce Kent, General Secretary
of C N D has been much maligned and
misrepresented by the National Press. He has
been described as a subversive and a Russian
agent. In a frank interview with Felix,
Monsignor Kent talks about his background,
how he became involved with C N D and the
conflicts he has faced within the Church.
'Dont wait for CND to do something for you. Ask
yourselves what you are doing for CND.'
FELIX: What actually happened
last year when the papers
suggested that Cardinal Hume
might ask you to resign as C N D
General Secretary?
Kent: I think the Cardinal was
under a lot of pressure from the
Catholic Conservative groups
who wanted me to go because I
was upsetting things they
believed in. I think he had a very
difficult time. I think he behaved
very generously and fairly. He
has not asked me to leave C N D .
FELIX: How long do you intend
to remain involved with CND?
Kent: I have never thought that I
would be a C N D officer
indefinitely. However, I hope
always to be involved with C N D .
I have been General Secretary
for almost five years and many
people, both inside and outside
the movement, probably think
that is long enough.
FELIX: D o you find it a
disadvantage in your work as a
iFrlday, February 24, 1984
priest to be a public figure?
Kent: It is an advantage for C N D
that I am well known. It is a
disadvantage for me personally
that I have no private life. If I go
on a tube or a bus I am recognised
and people talk to me. I just
accept that and live with it.
"In twenty years' time
we will either have
killed each other or
we will have chang-
ed the structure of
the world"
FELIX: Looking at the world
situation for the moment where
do you see the world in twenty
years time?
Kent: In twenty years time we will
either have killed each other or
we will have changed the
structure of the world. I really
mean that, because in twenty
years time the new weapons will
have resulted in a war.
'Everyone must make
up their own minds.
I would hate to
force people"
FELIX: Turning to more local
issues. D o you think Imperial
College students should work on
weapons projects?
Kent: That is something for the
individual. Some people will
decide they can't do it. I respect
that very much indeed. Others
have to do it because they have no
other way of living. In which case
they should keep on raising
questions about the structure of
the College, challenging M o D
contracts. Everybody must make
up their own minds. I would hate
to force people.
F E L I X : A t Imperial, many
students have signed a peace
pledge. D o you think the
scientists' signatures on such a
pledge are an important step
towards disarmament?
Kent: The more people of general
esteem in the world who take this
sort of stand the better. I would
suggest that Imperial twinned
with other Universities in so-
called Eastern Bloc countries
and got them to take the same
position.
