LAUWERYS: TWELVE MONTHS ON
Just twelve months after the publication of the Report on Student
Residence at the College by John Lauwerys, a number of decisions
arising from its recommendations have been implemented by College
Secretary John Smith in his College Notice on the Management of
Student Residence. This seems like an appropriate time therefore to
consider the background to the Lauwerys Report, the major
recommendations of the Report itself, and the decisions which have been,
or may soon be, taken arising from them.
The Background to the Report
The report was commissioned by
John Smith in July 1982 in the
light of the financial constraints
on the College caused by
education cuts. A t present the
College effectively subsidises the
residence accounts by not
charging it for certain services the
College provides to residence
buildings, principally mainten-
ance. This it is allowed to do
under U n i v e r s i t y G r a n t s
Committee (UGC) rules, which
although they forbid any direct
subsidy of residence do allow
c e r t a i n e x p e n d i t u r e o n
residences, known as the ' U G C
dispensations'. Despite allowing
the dispensations to continue the
U G C has asked universities to
calculate their costs and include
these as a footnote to their
residence accounts. In addition it
is the College's stated policy to
phase out the use of the
dispensations over a period of
several years, so that I C
calculating their cost for
inclusion as footnotes is also a
percursor to them being a direct
charge to the residence account.
This was the starting point
from which M r Lauwerys, Senior
Assistant Secretary, took up the
task of writing his report, which
runs to 75 pages plus appendices.
It considers all aspects of
residence management but is
principally concerned with how
the College can end the use of the
U G C dispensations by making
economies in expenditure from
and increases in income to the
residence account.
More Residence Places
However, the first of the report's
58 r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s is
unconnected with finance, or at
least with economies. He
concludes that in order to
maintain the ability to offer all
first years who apply a place in
residence the College will require
an additional 125 places in
College owned accommodation
by October 1985. This need is
principally due to the loss of
places with the ending of the lease
on the Fremantle Hotel next
year. John Smith has accepted

this recommendation in his
recent notice on student
residences and the College is
presently considering a number
of properties for purchase. Such a
purchase will, however, place
additional strain on the residence
account because it will have to
service the loan required to buy
the new property.
Much of the rest of the report is
devoted to examining every
aspect of residence management
and making recommendations
on everything from space
invaders machines to the price of
washing in hall laundries. These
recommendations fall into two
categories: the blatantly obvious
and the completely crack-pot.
However, this article will
concentrate on the report's
findings on residence finance as
these are the only ones of much
consequence.
Ending the Subsidies
The report correctly identifies the
competing calls on the residence
account over the next few years as
being: the decision to end
subsidies; the need to increase the
stock of accommodation; the
maintenance and improvement
of existing residence; and the
need to keep rent increases in line
with increases in student grants.
The resulting recommendation
gives top priority to the first two
of these with a lesser priority to
maintenance and no importance
being attatched to limiting rent
increases. Lauwerys states that
'student rents will have to be
increased above the levels that
would be necessary merely to
cover any increase in the running
costs of residences.'
John Smith in his notice on
student residence makes no
comment other than the need to
achieve a rent income to cover
costs, although he does not rule
out subsidies. The policy of
identifying all the costs of
residence and including them as
footnotes to the accounts is to be
implemented, and as a first step
the cost of the security and
messenger staff in Princes
Gardens will be charged to the
residence account from next year.
M r Smith denies that decisions
have already been taken on the
ending of further subsidies, but it
is widely believed the College will
end them as soon as it feels able
to.
Making up the loss
With the increased drain on the
residence account as a result of
the ending of subsidies it will
obviously be necessary to
increase income. Over 80% of
income to the residence account
is from student rents during term
time, the remainder being
vacation rent income. The
Lauwerys Report takes much
space considering possible
e c o n o m i e s i n r e s i d e n c e
management such as reducing the
number of wardens, but besides
the measures being mainly
undesirable in themselves the
savings which could be achieved
from them are small beer indeed
compared with the extent of the
subsidies which are to be phased
out. The value of those subsidies
which are presently identified as
footnotes to the accounts is about
half a million pounds. The scale
of the proposed savings from the
Report's recommendations for
economies is that of a few tens of
thousands at most even if there
are drastic cuts in the levels of
maintenance. Ironically, some of
the recommendations in the
Report would actually involve
new expenditure as M r Lauwerys
discovered that there are areas of
residence, notably the student
houses, which are already
unsatisfactory.
Clearly then there will have to
be a large increase in rent income
if the subsidies are ended.
Lauwerys pins his hopes on an
increase in the vacation lettings
income. He suggests an increase
of 50% should be possible by
better marketing of the College's
residences as tourist and
conference accommodation.
Vacation Lettings
In' 1982 the residence accounts .
benefitted by about £250,000
from vacation lettings. In 1983
this was increased to around
£360,000. But there is a definite
ceiling on vacation income since
there are only so many rooms to
be let, and the rent can only be
increased above a certain level at
the expense of less custom. Last
year a high occupancy rate was
achieved during the summer,
partly due to more IC students
staying in residence. At times
there were literally no rooms left
anywhere in College accommo-
dation. Clearly then the scope for
further increases in vacation
income are limited, although
something could be achieved if
conference trade was increased.
But the scope for extra income
from vacations would only cover
a fraction of the subsidies to
residence that it is proposed to
remove. A n d of course vacation
income can vary greatly from
year to year with the vagaries of
the tourist and conference trades.
Rent Increases
Although it is not stated
explicitly, there is therefore a
tacit assumption in the Lauwerys
Report that student rents will
have to go up faster than grants in
order to phase out the present
subsidies. Even if the vacation
income achieved in 1982 is
ultimately doubled in real terms,
which seems unlikely, there
would still'be shortfall of around
a quarter of a million pounds
even if one just includes those
subsidies which have already
been costed. This works out as a
rent increase of nearly six pounds
per week for each resident in halls
and houses. The College hopes to
introduce such an increase slowly
over a number of years, but if
subsidies are to be removed then
an increase of this magnitude is
ultimately inevitable.
C o m m e n t
The consequences of the College's policy of ending the subsidies
to the residence account will, it seems, be very grave indeed for
IC students. Accommodation is to be seen purely as a service to
students which must be completely self-financing, rather than an
integral and essential part of academic life. It is right that teaching
and research should receive the highest priority in times of
financial pressure, but this cannot be at the expense of giving
other areas a zero priority. It is in the academic interest of the
College to keep student rents at affordable levels—if not IC will
have difficulty attracting the best students.
There is a clear need for a re-think of College priorities towards
residence. We already have some of the most expensive halls
anywhere, and rents have increased well ahead of grants over the
past five or six years.
