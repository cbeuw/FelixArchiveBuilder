Lock Again
Dear Pallab
With reference to my letter of
two weeks ago and the subse-
quent replies, I believe the public
nature of my criticisms of Simon
Banton were justified since as an
R C S U official he holds a public
position and since his letter
appeared in London Student it
was a public event.
Simon was not actually being
mis-represented and if the article
was full of mistakes a letter
complaining at the abundance of
mistakes would have made more
sense to the readers than one
simply listing the errors.
I think the letter was an
example of what has often struck
me about the mascoteers—that
is, that they take the whole
business much too seriously.
They begin to think that details,
like the consistency of Mary,
actually matter and forget to
treat the whole thing as a joke—it
is this mentality which smacks of
mindlessness (like football hooli-
gans who forget that it is just a
game). I have no objection to
mascotry in principle, as a
combination of fun and money-
raising for charity. Incidentally, I
hope all IC students will have as
much time for charities when
they are earning large salaries
and also will give politics the
attention it deserves as they
become rather influential mem-
bers of society.
As a member of Ents and
entertainments organiser in my
hall of residence, I am fairly well
acquianted with the problems of
laying on events in Imperial. As
for being rejected by my peers, I
am not aware that this is the case.
Actually, I get the impression
RCSU has been rejected by most
of my peers. I don't think that
this is a happy situation but I
think the explanation that this is
down purely to the apathy of
RCS students, while leaving
RCSU conveniently blameless, is
incorrect. They have been posi-
tively turned off by what they
have seen by RCSU.
I went to the first RCS U G M
and discovered it was primarily a
dart throwing event—spontane-
ous lunacy is funny, but
organised lunacy is a bore, and so
are its participants. As for
Broadsheet, I read through the
first two editions of in-jokes
before giving up—it just wasn't
worth the effort to read through
it.
However, I will admit that
Simon may well be as much an

obnoxious hack as I am an
'apathetic non-entity', although I
wasn't the only one around him
who cringed as he discovered his
letter in London Student.

Broadsheet
Conspiracy
Dear Pallab
Just a note to everybody who
read last Monday's edition of
Broadsheet and might be wonder-
ing why I did not submit a
manifesto for RCSU President.
I have never at any time
received notification of anything
to do with manifestos. I have
never even been told that I was
able to submit one, let alone told
the closing date. On Sunday
evening (the papers came down
the previous Friday) I went to the
RCSU Office to ask about this
and was told that Broadsheet had
already been printed and I was
too late. Most of the R C S U
officers present found it difficult
to hide their smirks.
Considering that RCSU's fre-
quent answer to criticism is 'get
involved and change things' I
find it incredible that they make it
so difficult for 'outsiders' to do
just that.
My manifesto has been distri-
buted separately for anyone who
is interested.
Yours
Ann Collins
Candidate for RCSU President
Dear Sir
I would like to take this
opportunity to explain my appar-
ent indifference and apathy con-
cerning my proposal of Ann
Collins for R C S U President.
The reason that I didn't submit
a proposal manifesto for this
week's Broadsheet is that it was
never mentioned to me, neither
written nor verbally. When I
made enquiries about it last
Monday morning I was told that
it had been mentioned in the
'What's On' section in last week's
edition of F E L I X . As I was away
for the entire weekend, not
returning until afer the copy
deadline on Sunday evening, I
was unable to submit an article.
Anyone who has missed the
Hustings (held yesterday), please
see Ann or myself for any
questions concerning her mani-
festo.
Yours
Lee Evans
PS: Whoever writes the Broad-
sheet 'Vicious Rumours' depart-
ment may like to apply for a post
as a reporter with London
Student: Ann lived in Falmouth-
Keogh last year and has never
been out with Karl Schmidt!
Ann Collins
Conspiracy
Dear Pallab
As a point of information, I
should like to explain that all
candidates for the RCSU elec-
tions were notified personally of
the copy deadline for the mani-
festos edition of Broadsheet.
In addition to this, it was
printed in 'What's On' in last
week's F E L I X (no 667) that all
manifestos had to be submitted,
at the latest on Saturday 18 Feb.
It seems to me that any serious
candidate would have made the
effort to find this out well in
advance instead of leaving it too
late and then whining about a
supposed conspiracy.
Yours sincerely

The Letter
College
Wouldn't
Publish
Dear Pallab
Enclosed is a letter to all the
staff of Imperial that administra-
tion thought unfit to publish in the
Gazette.
Would you do us the service of
publishing it in FELIX. Show
FIDO that you do provide news
and comments in a responsible and
objective manner.
The College's budget for wages
and salaries is a fixed amount.
Any additional money requested
by us can only be met by reducing
the money available for claims
made by ASTEMS, A U T and
N A L G O . Therefore we arc ask-
ing you if N U P E could have the
• first bite of the cake.
In the past, we have been I he-
last section of employees to settle
our wage claims. We have been
unable to negotiate from a
position of strength because only
the crumbs of the cake were
left—and what was left was
simply too small an amount to
support our 469 workers.
Since our wages are so low,
members of N U P E have left
College employment, or would
not fill vacant posts leaving 385
of us (as at 1/7/83) to do their
duties as well as our own. The
result has been prowlers on the
College premises, loss of personal
belongings and disagreements
over duties. If you help us now,
we in turn would be more alert,
caring and able to help you when
you needed our support.
In the financial year 1982/3,
the total cost of staff (1,713) in
A S T E M S , A U T and N A L G O
was £25,097,562 (£14,651.23 per
head). In the same period the cost
of the Cleaning, Manual and
Anciallary workers (385) was
£2,120,856 (£5,508.71 per head).
For this money our members had
to work long, arduous hours
throughout the whole seven days
and nights of the week.
This year more than any other,
N U P E is fighting for a substan-
tial increase in pay as a measure
towards the abolition of low pay
and the establishment of a basic
rate equivalent to two-thirds the
national average, currently
£99.47 per week (source NES
April 1983, updated by index of.
average earnings October 1983,
published 14 December 1983).
Would you please respond to
our call by inundating M r Mellor
(Asst Personnel Secretary), Sher-
field Building, with your support
for our cause. E A Wheeler

Thanks!
Dear Pallab
This is just a short note from
the SF Soc committee thanking
you for the help you and F E L I X
gave our society during the
organisation of our Picocon
event. It was a great help to us
and the con wouldn't have
worked without it. The event was
a great success overall and people
enjoyed themselves. Thanks to
everyone else who helped, you're
all pan-galactic hyperbeings.
