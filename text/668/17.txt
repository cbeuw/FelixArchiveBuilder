ELECTION COrKETTEE STATEMENT B.
In view of the number of complaints concerning Clause 8 . (Election Committee
Statement A), Elections Committee met and as a result, i t was decided to
withdraw Clause 8. completely.
This clause was i n i t i a l l y drawn up in an attempt to prevent unfair advantage
being gained through abuse of access to either commercial or CCU equipment.

of costs.
Due to the withdrawal of Clause 8., Elections Committee w i l l now be checking
