They are in The Observer
every Sunday, yet
Are these
the eyes of a
madman?
These are the eyes of Michael Frayn. For seven
years now, week in, week out (apart from 4
weeks' paid holiday a year), first in The
Guardian, then in The Observer, Frayn has
had to write an article. 700 words 3 times a
week for The Guardian; 900 words once a
week in The Observer.
He has also written two novels, The T i n
Men and The Russian Interpreter. Appeared
regularly on Granada T V . Wrote for TW3.
Contributed to The Age of Austerity. He is
also married, with two daughters.
Yet there is still virtually no evidence that Frayn
has been affected by this. However a growing
number of people read The Observer every
Sunday for this reason alone. T o be actually
there, on hand, when he does finally — well
— snap.

' Money lost' - reports
T H E R E WAS N O question of a
treasury loan of £1,000,000 being
lost, said London University in
a statement during the vacation.
The statement followed suggest-
ions in the national daily press
that the money was lost—the
newspapers got their story from
the Second Report of the Com-
mittee for Public Accounts,
published last month.
The loan to the University was
towards the cost of buying prop-
erty in Bloomsbury. The Com-
mittee said that the purchase of
the Bloomsbury Estate No. 2 was
financed by an Exchequer loan
of £lm. issued in 1950, a grant
of £250,000 from the L C C and
£336,000 from the University's
capital resources. The loan was
to be converted into grants as
the property was brought into
use for University purposes.
Though this was basically a book
transaction, the intention was to
give the Treasury, the Depart-
ment of Education and Science,
and the U G C (University Grants
Committee) added control over
the development of the property.
B E L A T E D STEPS
In July 1965, the balance of
the fund, after repayment of the
University's original contribution,
was announced as £608,000. It
was subsequently shown that
£499,000 of this was temporarily
lent to O T H E R University funds.
