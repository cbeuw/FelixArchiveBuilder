P A M J O H N S T O N is the new
Union messenger, replacing Stan
Branker who left this summer after
a six year stay. She took up resi-
dence in the tiny office only last week,
and so is unfamiliar with the routine.

UNTIL 1964 ICU'S mascot wag
a brass eagle called Phoenix.
This was 'Lost' under very dubi-
ous circumstances, namely a
drunken mascot officer, at the
end of that year and there fol-
lowed an unofficial adoption of
Queen's Tower (c.f. University
College). But this was generally
felt by the more active members
of Wooden Horse to be a retro-
grade step, giving those whose
mascots had been stolen by I.C.
no chance to retaliate. So "Mike"
was born and it is solely due to
the organisation and practical
ability of Ralph Cornforth that
the ideas have become reality.
He found himself the sole person
interested after being let down
by several people who had pro-
mised designs and assistance.
