FELIX 11
ATHLETICS CLUB TOUR
IN A LAST desperate attempt to beat the currency restrictions
and push our razor-edged economy over the brink, I.C. Athletics
team exported itself to Germany.
The regulations of the Civil department committed many of onr
best men to field courses; but what we lacked on the track wc were
determined to make up lor it.

U N D E R W A T E R C L U B

TO NORWAY
WITH BOOTS
A MINI-BUS, a 1948 car, 219
man-days of dehydrated food and
12 members of the Rover Crew
were some of the items shipped
on board the "Leda" at New-
castle on June 25th.
The crossing to Norway was short
and calm, which was more than can
be said for our driving in Norway.
The vehicles made the 5000 ft. climb
into the heart of the Jotenhcim
Mountains without getting more than
a little steamed up. A base camp
was set up at Leirvassbu from which
we were able to climb at least a dozen
peaks each within a day and a
separate camp was set up at
Spiterstuien from which the two
higest mountains in Northern Europe.
Galdhoppigen and Glittertind (8.000
ft.), were climbed.
Although the mountains were de-
serted, we were in walking distance of
Leivassbu and we met many Nor-
wegians, mainly students, who taught
us Norwegian songs and dances and
in return we tried to teach them some
of ours to our common amusement.
On the whole we were fortunate to
be " lost " in the mountains and yet
still make conact with the Nor-
wegians.
The I.C. pair, Hobson and Dickson, keep in close contact
wuh the opposition during the 1500 m at Mannheim.
BANG!
