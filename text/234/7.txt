S O U T H K E N . is s o m e t h i n g of a " no-man's l a n d " between K e n s i n g -
t o n proper a n d C h e l s e a . It is b o u n d e d r o u g h l y by the arterial C r o m w e l l
R o a d and the F u l h a m R o a d . A t the western end it merges w i t h the bed-sit
realms of E a r l s C o u r t , w h i c h is thus w i t h i n w a l k i n g distance o f the College.
It is a f a i r l y undistinguished area a n d can c l a i m no sordid crimes or
battles to its fame. Flats of v a r y i n g rent and q u a l i t y a b o u n d in its
numerous squares and crescents and their residents are the p r i n c i p a l p o p u l a -
t i o n of m u c h of the district.
T h e s h o p p i n g area a r o u n d the T u b e station is unusual i n its construction.
T h e site appears to be a n o v e r - g r o w n collection of " corner-shops." C a f e s
a n d restaurants to cater for a l l tastes are plentiful and whatever the U n i o n

don't go downstairs without £2! Bookshop's, record shops, ticket agents,
hairdressers—almost a l l requirements are catered for except that there is
a lack of a good grocer. T h e nearest one is i n G l o u c e s t e r R o a d .
A l o n g established firm is the B e l g i a n Pastry S h o p i n F u l h a m R o a d .
T h i s has been p r o d u c i n g its fine pastries for over two h u n d r e d years. T h e
K i n g ' s R o a d , the f a m o u s Chelsea mecca for a l l the " i n - c r o w d , " lies beyond
F u l h a m R o a d . It was so called because i n earlier times it was f o r the
exclusive use of the K i n g a n d his guests. It is a fine s h o p p i n g area
w i t h its dozens of antique and o l d furniture shops, gift shops, dress shops
a n d f o o d stores. A t the eastern end is Sloane Square w i t h its large stores.
T h e nearest department store to the C o l l e g e is H a r r o d ' s in K n i g h t s b r i d g e .
