Proud Record
The full measure of the late Rector's effect on the College did not
become apparent until this week. When the members began to consider
what he had accomplished in only eleven years, they found a proud
record. In his preface to the current U n i o n Handbook he wrote : " this
College is by general consent the leading College of Science and Technology
in the country." It became so as a result of his brilliant administration
and foresight. T h e College will long have cause to be grateful to h i m and
to admire his achievements.
Chance of a lifetime
O n e idea w h i c h w i l l be t h r o w n at t h e Freshers i n these first t e w days
i s : " Y o u must strike a h a p p y balance between w o r k a n d p l a y — b o t h
are i m p o r t a n t . " B y the t i m e y o u have h e a r d this f r o m the President
( W h i c h one was he?) a n d y o u r tutor ( R e m e m b e r h i m w e l l , he m a y never
see y o u again) y o u m a y w e l l w o n d e r (a) what the — does i t m e a n a n d (b)
what are they trying to sell?
T h e U L U h a n d b o o k describes I C as h a v i n g a h i g h l y independant
u n i o n — t h i s is indeed true. B e i n g such a large college i t c a n offer m a n y
facilities i n its o w n u n i o n f o r w h i c h smaller institutions must l o o k back
to U L U . It i s also o n e o f the f e w colleges n o t affiliated to the N a t i o n a l
U n i o n o f Students a n d h a s o n occasions acted as a n independent v o i c e f o r
students, e.g. the loans l o b b y o f P a r l i a m e n t last M a y .
I C U n i o n has a n advantage over most other U n i v e r s i t i e s i n that i t
is a medium-sized b o d y c o m p r i s e d o f three smaller bodies a n d itself part o f
a large body. T h e large b o d y is U L U a n d the three smaller ones the
" constituent college unions " — n o t e that phrase, i t is a l o c a l cliche. It
can thus p r o v i d e opportunities f o r people o f a l l abilities. T h e a m b i t i o u s
m a y find their niche i n the c o r r i d o r s o f . M a l e t Street ( U L U ) , those content
w i t h a smaller sphere o f influence w i l l find a m p l e opportunities to display
their talents i n the c o r r i d o r s , stair-cases a n d liftshafts o f I C . F o r those
w h o prefer a n even tighter k n i t c o m p a n y , the constituent college u n i o n s
have many f l o u r i s h i n g a n d influential organisations.
A s for striking a h a p p y balance this o b v i o u s l y means different things
to different people. S o m e c a n be a President o f a society a n d get a F i r s t ,
others c a n d o n o t h i n g a n d s t i l l f a i l . I n y o u r first weeks experiment, find
out what you c a n a l l o w f o r w o r k ! Seriously t h o u g h , it's n o g o o d h i d i n g
away a n d saying y o u w i l l enjoy y o u r s e l f after y o u g r a d u a t e — n o w is the
time o f opportunity.
Y o u w i l l n o doubt have j o i n e d some o f the seductive societies y o u
saw o n Freshers' D a y . P o s s i b l y y o u r attitude w a s " I w a n t to j o i n t h e F o l k
S o n g C l u b because I l i k e to listen to folk m u s i c . " or " I f I j o i n the P h o t o -
graphic Society 1 c a n use their d a r k r o o m s . " W h i l e n o t u n c o m m e n d a b l e ,
these are not the best reasons f o r j o i n i n g . A n y k i n d o f society depends f o r
its success o n the activity a n d i n v o l v m e n t o f its members—please get
i n v o l v e d ! D o n ' t i m a g i n e y o u c a n step i n t o a society >as President ( V i c e -
President possibly) but y o u c a n give y o u r ideas, help a n d t i m e r i g h t f r o m
the1
start. T h e r e is n o need to be a f r a i d o f b e i n g t u r n e d a w a y as a
" Fresher " — y o u are o n l y a Fresher as l o n g as y o u act as one. T h e r e are
n o closed s h o p s — a l l doors w i l l o p e n i f y o u p u s h h a r d e n o u g h — a n d i t i s
time a few people d i d start p u s h i n g : the sweet d r u g o f apathy m a y easily
overcome this fertile college.
O b v i o u s l y y o u k n o w best where y o u r interests l i e , b u t d o not neglect
to broaden y o u r o u t l o o k — y o u r r e a l talents m a y still be latent. T h e r e are
opportunities f o r everyone, b o r e d o m s h o u l d be a n i m p o s s i b i l i t y .
Top of the Union
I N T H E U N I O N we have the m a k i n g s o f a successful a d m i n i s t r a t i o n .
U n d o u b t e d l y the p o w e r lies w i t h President T o n y D u k e . H e h a s already
s h o w n h i m s e l f capable of e m p l o y i n g h i s powers a n d d i r e c t i n g i t to useful
purposes. A t the time o f writing (28th) I suspect he has some schemes f o r
m a k i n g large changes i n the U n i o n affairs.
D a v i d M c B a i n , V i c e - P r e s i d e n t , is a h a r d - w o r k i n g diligent officer.
A l r e a d y he has made efficient use o f h i s l i m i t e d t i m e (he is a t h i r d year
engineer) to i m p l e m e n t the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s o f the C o u n c i l decision o n
notice boards.
Secretary B r e n d a n P a r k e r is another h a r d - w o r k i n g m e m b e r o f D u k e ' s
staff. H e w o r k e d h a r d under F l e t c h e r last y e a r t o g a i n this post a n d n o
doubt learned m u c h f r o m this teacher.
A Good
Beginning.
K »s wiui a aeep sense of loss
that we start the year after the
sad death of the Rector, Sir
Patrick Linstead. Although he
was an eminent scientist and ad-
ministrator he will be remember-
ed by the Union for the interest
he snowed in student affairs.
At this time it is vital for us to
maintain the high standards in
the life of the College of which
we are proud. We must show
that we are a strong and united
Union by our sense of loyalt;
and responsibility. We must try
to do this without dampening cor
spirits. We are a rare example of
a self-governing Union, we must
not lose any of the advantages
which this gives ns.
As an executive one of our
main difficulties is one of com-
munication. In a college of this
size it is difficult for us to keep
in touch with the ordinary mem-
bers. We do our best through
FELIX and Union meetings, and!
the notice boards. The Union
caters for most interests but it is
up to yon as the ordinary member
to make the effort to get to know
what is going on and where.
In conclusion, may I welcome
yon all to the start of the new
session,.and from now on it's all
yours!

That Crowd
Again!
Sir,
A t the end o f last term, a private
party was held i n the I C W A lounge.
A t 11.15 p . m . (closing time), the party
was invaded b y over twenty people,
members o f what c a n be termed the
b a r - c r o w d . T h e rowdiest a n d most
objectionable were asked w i t h o u t suc-
cess to leave. A f t e r a b o u t a n h o u r ,
some o f the gatecrashers created a
disturbance a n d a b r a w l b r o k e out i n
w h i c h f u r n i t u r e w a s sent flying a n d
glasses a n d bottles smashed. A f t e r -
wards,, one o f the invited guests, w h o
had tried to stop the fight amongst
the gate crashers, was taken to hos-
p i t a l . H e h a d three stitches p u t a b o v e
his eye a n d w a s f o u n d to have a
b r o k e n nose.
Perhaps the most a p p a l l i n g aspect
this affair i s that i t w a s n o t a n i s o -
lated incident. T h r o u g h o u t the
whole o f last year, a continuous series
of c o m p l a i n t s were made t h r o u g h
these c o l u m n s about s i m i l a r i n c i -
dents i n v o l v i n g the " b a r - c r o w d " —
the b r e a k i n g u p o f parties, destruction
of U n i o n a n d H a l l property, a n d
v a n d a l i s m i n general.
A s yet, despite the frequency w i t h
w h i c h these incidents occur, n o offi-
cial action has been taken. Is the
U n i o n completely powerless t o act i n
these cases—or merely u n w i l l i n g ?
