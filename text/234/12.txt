Mascot
Ready
MIKE, GIANT sized micro-
meter built in such secrecy last
year as mascot for ICU, is to be
inaugurated (or should it be de-
dicated) at the first IC Union
General Meeting of the year, on
November 3rd.
The secrecy has been maintain-
ed by the 'Wooden Horse'
organisation (ICs movement for
mascotry of all kinds) under the
leadership of Ralph Cornforth.
This task was all the more im-
portant because after IC's suc-
cessful 'snatches' of mascots from
Kings, City University (then
Northampton College) and SOAS
they would have appeared highly
ridiculous if they had 'Lost' IC's
own mascot before it was even
complete. They also undertook
the entire design, manufacture
and installation of 'Mike'.
Old
Buildings
M i k e ranks undoubtedly as one of
the finest examples of student ingen-
u i t y i n the c o u n t r y — n o t o n l y is he
f u l l y o p e r a t i o n a l , but he has a de-
fence m e c h a n i s m w h i c h a c c o r d i n g to
" W o o d e n H o r s e " can never be pene-
trated. Its 170 lbs. of steel a n d brass
w i l l l i e o n a H ton concrete p l i n t h i n
the U n i o n lower lounge, a n d is p r o -
tected f r o m a n y marauders by clamps
and safes, and a h i g h l y c o m p l e x elec-
tronic a l a r m grid. I n fact, the U n i o n
asks us to m a k e it clear that it can
accept no responsibility for m i s a d v e n -
ture to any amateur mascot pirate.
A l t h o u g h " M i k e " w i l l be p e r m a -
nently o n show i n the U n i o n B u i l d -
ing, he w i l l be brought into U n i o n
G e n e r a l M e e t i n g s a n d other occasions
as m u c h as possible. I m p e r i a l C o l -
lege has a mascot to be p r o u d of,
a n d w h i c h s h o u l d enliven the recently
rather d u l l L o n d o n mascot scene.
Failures
B y general assent last year was a
good year i n the U n i o n , hence it was
perhaps inevitable that there s h o u l d
be a large c r o p of failures. T h e
exams have c l a i m e d v i c t i m s f r o m a l l
parts of the U n i o n ; large sections of
D r a m s o c a n d Ents. C o m m i t t e e have
f a i l e d to return. T h e C a r n i v a l o r -
ganisers, J i m M u r r a y a n d Peter Jones,
have both failed, as has the c h a i r m a n
of Ents., B r i a n C o m p t o n . It seems
probable that K e i t h G u y , last year's
C h a i r m a n of S C C a n d unsuccessful
candidate for the presidency w i l l be
n o m i n a t e d by C o u n c i l as C h a i r m a n
of Ents.
F E L I X has lost a l l of its most ex-
perienced staff and begins the year
w i t h its youngest ever E d i t o r .
N o t e : D a i H o w e l l set u p a r e c o r d
last year. It was the first t i m e he
passed a year the first t i m e !

News
V e r y m u c h i n the news is S i r W i l l i s
Jackson, H e a d of the E l e c t r i c a l E n -
gineering D e p a r t m e n t . E a r l i e r this
s u m m e r he was a p p o i n t e d President
of the B r i t i s h A s s o c i a t i o n . A s he is
o n l y just t a k i n g o n this post he has
not yet announced any intentions a n d
w i l l not deliver his P r e s i d e n t i a l a d -
dress until next summer. H o w e v e r it is
reported that m o r e time w i l l be given
at future meetings to s y m p o s i a w h i c h
w i l l b r i n g a n u m b e r o f disciplines
together to discuss matters of c o m m o n
interest.
O n October 31st S i r W i l l i s is to
c h a i r one of the 1966 G r a n a d a G u i l d -
h a l l lectures. T h e speaker is Sebastian
de F e r r a n t i , whose subject w i l l be
" T e c h n o l o g y a n d p o w e r . " O n N o -

New H a l l
W I T H I N T W E L V E hours of the a n -
nouncement of the Selective E m p l o y -
ment T a x , the college received requests
f r o m contractors whose tenders were
under consideration for review or
even w i t h d r a w a l of their tenders. These
included the contract for the new h a l l
development i n Eastside.
T h e situation was critical because a
stipulation of the a n o n y m o u s bene-
factor was that w o r k s h o u l d begin be-
fore 21st M a y . O n l y by i m m e d i a t e
negotiations was it possible to retain
the p l a n n e d starting date o f the 16th
of M a y .
W o r k is n o w c o n t i n u i n g s m o o t h l y
a n d the h a l l is due for c o m p l e t i o n f o r
the S u m m e r t e r m of 1968. It is re-
ported that d u r i n g the S u m m e r the
w o r k c o m p o u n d has been b r o k e n into
at night, possibly by students.
F E L I X
This year F E L I X finds itself
with a decimated staff. What it
r >eds NOW are people to give
a hand. To give you an idea,
there are vacancies for : report-
ers, photographers, sub-editors,
salesgirls, business organisers
and cartoonists. Literally scores
of people are required, especial-
ly Freshers. FELIX holds meet-
ings in the Press room at the top
of the Union on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 12.45 p.m. If you
cannot get to these visit one of
the editorial staff in his room—
at least you'll get some coffee!
