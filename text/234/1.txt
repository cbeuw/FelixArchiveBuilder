PRICES
DOWN
IN N O V E M B E R ol 1965 it
was announced by the Halls of
Residence committee that Hall
fees would be raised by 5/- per
weeki this rise to take effect
from August of this year. The
aim was to eliminate a deficit in
the reserve funds of £1200. It
would have brought the fees in
Southside up to £81 p.a.
The University of London has
decided, however, in view of the
Prices and Incomes freeze, that
such increases cannot be made.
(The University being a Govern-
ment financed body.) The fees
thus remain at the level decided
in 1962/63, e.g. Southside £75,
New Beit £68 p.a.
T h e same freeze applies to a l l r e -
fectory charges w h i c h w o u l d p r o b -
ably have risen to keep up w i t h i n -
creased taxation a n d other charges.

tive E m p l o y m e n t T a x w o u l d have to
be paid f o r a l l the c l e a n i n g a n d r e -
fectories staff but, since the U n i o n is
a charity, the tax w o u l d later be r e -
funded.
N o t e : Because o f the current credit
squeeze H u l l , E x e t e r a n d some other
Universities have announced cut-backs

CARNIVAL
£1001 4s 7d was the sum handed
over to the Notting Hill Hous-
ing Trust (last year's charity) by
the IC Carnival this month, de-
spite the statement to Union
Council by last year's president
Adrian Fletcher that it had rais-
ed £1,500.

for the college, A Memorial Service
is to be held, and details will be an-
