SIR PATRICK LINSTEAD, CBE, FRS, who died suddenly on
the 24lh of September, had guided Imperial College through a
crucial period of its history. A graduate of the College, he was a
member of the Chemistry department staff until 1938, and gained
an international reputation in organic Chemistry. He was then
successively Professor at Sheffield and at Harvard, Deputy Director
of Research at the war-time Ministry of Supply, and Director of
the National Chemical Laboratory. He returned in 1949 becoming
head of the Chemistry department and Dean of the RCS; and was
appointed Rector in 1955.
His scientific attainments and contributions to the development of
University education, (which included membership of the Robbins C o m -
mittee), are well known. In South Kensington he will also be particularly
remembered for his personal influences on the nature and quality of the
massive expansion of the College, which had been initiated under his pre-
decessor, A i r Chief Marshal Sir Roderick Hill. Steering through the com-
plications caused by the retention of the Queen's Tower he sought to
ensure that the large new academic buildings were modern and functional
but would not " astonish our neighbours and clash with the pleasant legacies
of the past." Within them he successfully fostered the development of
new departments and fields of study, and of interdepartmental collaboration.
One of his earliest decisions was that residential expansion should have
equal priority with academic building, and from this sprang the redevelop-
ment of Prince's Gardens, which will eventually accommodate more than
one thousand students. His concern for the nurturing of a University
environment was also shown by the opening of the Playfair and Haldane
Libraries, in the expansion of the Harlington sports ground, by his active
encouragement of the General Studies programme, and in the project to
build a swimming pool and squash courts on the North side of Prince's
Gardens, which is now under way.
The Rector was closely interested in the activities of the Union, (" that
beneficient organisation") and of its many clubs and societies. T h e
addition of two storeys to the original Union building was carried out in
the first years of his rectorship. Subsequently he designated as " U n i o n
Areas " much space in South Side and in the College Block, (which is soon
to be built); and he had prepared the ground for the necessary strengthening
of the U n i o n financies to accompany this growth. H e gave strong support
to such new enterprises as the Exploration Board and, with Lady Linstead,
attended many social functions in the Union. H i s urbane after dinner
speeches o n these occasions were enlivened by many adroit shafts of
humour, which were usually proceeded by a speculative glance at the
ceiling. H e was always accessible for consultation with the President of
the Union, and maintained excellent relations with successive generations
of student officers.
Sir Patrick was a humane man of wide sympathies and interests. His
long experience of the College enabled him to graft the new onto the
healthiest elements of the old, and it is sad that he has not lived to see the
complete fulfillment of the design. Those who knew him feel his passing as
a personal loss.

T H E C E N T E N A R Y of the
birth of H G. Wells is comme-
morated by a variety of public
and college events. In December
Lord Snow is to give a special
Centenary lecture in the Huxley
Building when he will speak
about Wells die literary pioneer
and scientific educator.
Earlier this Autumn the BBC
broadcast a documentary televis-
ion programme on Wells entitled
'Whoosh'. In this three mem-
bers of Wellsoc appeared briefly.
T h e biggest event i n Wellsoc's au-
tumn timetable is the Wells Week or-
ganised i n honour of H . G . Wells—
one of IC's most celebrated alumni.
The main feature of this week will be
" a n Art of Science Exhibition," but
there will also be a dinner attended
by Wells' son, G . P. Wells, and show-
ings of four films based on H . G .
Wells' books.
The A r t of Science Exhibition is
to be held from 7th to 11th Novem-
ber and is organised by Colin Phil-
lips, room 637 Tizard Hall. A l l
Union members may enter using the
forms available around the college.
Entries are invited for such cate-
gories as painting, sculpture, music,
robots, inventions, science fiction—
in fact almost anything will be con
sidered provided that the entry is a
work of art inspired by science, in-
corporating scientific apparatus or
produced scientifically.
A long list of distinguished scientists
and artists has been invited to judge
the entries, each taking on an ap-
propriate category. They will collab-
orate in judging any entries which do
not fall into a listed class. For a
special predictions category, the en-
tries will be buried, and twenty years
hence the then Rector will be invited
to judge which forecast has been most
nearly fulfilled. T h e winner will then
receive his prize.
Wellsoc is again offering a full pro-
gramme of weekly meetings. A s
usual the first meeting is a crowd-
drawer, being a lecture with demon-
strations o n hypnotism., This is fol-
lowed i n later weeks by a discussion
of the possibility of creating life, Her-
mann Bondi on cosmology, a lecture
on brain-washing and voodoo, and
several other intriguing topics.
T h e Society's special study groups
set up last year to investigate flying
saucers and ghosts will continue. The
latter group will become affiliated to
the society for Psychical Research.
I know
a bank
Actually, as Shakespeare fans will recall, the bank
that O b e r o n was talking about was the sort
whereon the wild t h y m e blew. Just the thing for a
m i d s u m m e r night's d r e a m no d o u b t b u t not nearly
as m u c h practical use to the student as the other k i n d
of b a n k — t h e M i d l a n d , for example.
There's nothing difficult about opening an account with
the M i d l a n d , just a few simple formalities and the
thing's done. H a v e a w o r d w i t h y o u r local m a n a g e r —
he'll be very willing to help. A n d y o u don't have to
go to A t h e n s for this bank, either. There's a branch
of the M i d l a n d i n every university city a n d town.
