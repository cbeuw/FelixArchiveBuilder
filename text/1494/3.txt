The Union have admitted that the
turnout at last week’s Summer Ball
was disappointing, saying that the
poor weather, a low turnout from other
universities, and the number of students
who hadn’t finished their exams “had a
big hit on sales.”
The Union were forced to hold the
Summer Ball two weeks before the
end of term this year, instead of the
usual one week, because the clash
with Glastonbury meant that “acts
and equipment” would have been too
difficult to hire. Union President Alex
Kendall explained that the difficulty in
having the Summer Ball at the very end

Disappointing
Summer Ball turnout
Union expected to release Ball
finances next week
the event, and on the day, meant “last
minute ticket sales weren’t as good.”
In previous years there has been a
significant spike in ticket sales in the
run-up to the Summer Ball and several
hundred on-the-door sales.
However, he also pointed to the live
music on offer, like Laura Marling and
Ian Brown, saying that “the live acts
were great,” and pointed out that the
Summer Ball after-party was “packed.”
The after-party in the Union had a
capacity of 1000 students and ended
at 4am. Agreements with the Council
and neighbours over noise meant that
the after-party could not continue
into Sunday as in previous years. The
Survivor’s Photo had to be hastily
organized by a Felix photographer at
the end of the night when it became
clear that arrangements had not been
made.
Kendall said the Union had been
vindicated in removing an explicit
black tie dress code and letting
people wear what they want at the
Summer Ball: “I think we clearly
were justified in saying that black tie
wasn’t compulsory as people looked
comfortable in whatever they were
wearing.”
The Summer Ball was split between
two stages this year, with student
bands in Prince’s Gardens and external
acts on the main stage on the Queen’s
Lawn. The low turnout meant that
Prince’s Gardens, where the food stalls
were sited, was virtually empty for
much of the day. Kendall admitted that
the Prince’s Gardens stage “could have
been more full.”
Deputy President (Finance &
Services)-elect Michael Foster, whose
responsibility it is to plan next year’s
Summer Ball, said that he would gauge
the reaction of students “and adapt
accordingly.” He assured students that
any decisions on the direction of the
Summer Ball “will be based on student
input, opinion and feedback, as well as
an objective assessment of the Ball’s
success.”
of term, after everybody’s exams, is that
first years would be moving out of halls.
The full financial implications of the
poor turnout are not yet known but the
Union says it will release the full figures
early next week; it is still analysing
bar sales and tickets sold on the day.
However, members of the Union have
privately acknowledged that the losses
could run into the low tens of thousands.
1269 tickets were sold, with the vast
majority of this believed to be Imperial
students. Union President Alex Kendall
said, “I would suggest not expecting
turnout from other [universities] in
the future,” although other students
would always be welcome. He said

Students warned about
campus pervert
On Saturday 18th June, during the
Summer Ball, an at around 3pm in
the Central Library, a female Imperial
student, who has asked to remain
anonymous, was followed into the 2nd
floor toilets by another person who then
attempted to take pictures of her by
sliding their mobile phone underneath
the stall.
The female student told Felix that,
“this person positioned herself/himself
in the cubicle to me and proceeded to
take a succession of photos of me with
a mobile phone by sliding their hand
from underneath the partition and then
again from underneath the door before
fleeing.”
After the initial shock of the incident,
the female student informed the security
guard on duty, who had spotted a tall,
slim man of Oriental descent taking
pictures of him on a mobile just
moments before she had arrived.
Even though the library was virtually
empty, the student remembered that
there was also another female student
standing outside the toilets by the water
fountain at the time of the incident. She
described her as “around 5 foot 2-3ish,
with long brown hair and wearing
colourful shoes.”
Aemun Reza The student said that “when I first
spoke to campus security, they seemed
very taken aback at the incident, and
I guess I could assume that this sort
of thing probably had never occurred
before.”
She then reported the incident to
Sherfield security in the hope that
they would be able to examine CCTV
security but she felt that the female
supervisor showed a “complete lack
of sensitivity and rudeness.” However,
security has been through the CCTV
footage of the reception but could not
come across an Oriental male holding a
mobile phone in the reception area. The
Head of Security of Sherfield informed
Felix that there are no CCTV cameras in
the area of the bathroom.
They believe that finding the exact
identity of the person will be difficult
due to lack of description from the
library security guard and the fact
that the female student only caught a
glimpse of hand taking the picture. They
assured Felix that they are doing all they
can to catch the offender.
However, the female student was
unhappy with the way her case has
been dealt with. “For the amount of
tuition fees Imperial charges, this sort
of appalling level of service provided
for the safety of its students is, I feel,
utterly unacceptable,” she said. Even
though security had immediately
contacted the police and advised the
student to do the same, she still felt
that she had to take the responsibility
of reporting the incident to the Chelsea
Police station herself, where she then
says she waited for four and a half
hours to talk to an officer. An officer
has been assigned to the case and a
report is going to be filed.
As this incident occurred during the
exam period, the female student was
“pretty shaken” as it has significantly
affected her revision. She said that her
department was “fairly sympathetic”
but felt that they weren’t “particularly
supportive”. The department stated,
“The regrettable incident described has
been noted by the relevant Personal
Tutor, the Senior Tutor and the
Examinations Officer and placed on
file. The incident will be discussed by
a sub-board of the Board Examiners
consisting of the Senior Tutor, the
Director of Undergraduate Studies
and the Chairman of the Board of
Examiners in July and then again at
final moderation.”
The female student would like to warn
other females to be vigilant about “such
a depraved person roaming around
College.”
