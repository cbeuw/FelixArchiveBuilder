Centrefold of the Year Drunken Mates of the Year
Top Five Fails

Worst Scuba Diver
of the Year
This plucky postgrad (allitera-
tion award?) drunkenly stole
author Jonathon Frazen’s
glasses from his face. How?
By shouting “Channel 4!”
snatching the glasses, jump-
ing over a fence, and running
away. He even had a fucking
helicopter looking for him. He
was so badass the police had
to drop the charges.
The much loved Twatter user
just didn’t get the hang of scu-
ba diving. It was his first, and
last, attempt at the sport after
a Seal botched his eyebrow
piercing. They don’t even have
opposable thumbs, of course
they couldn’t do it right. Why
would you want a stud there. I
know he was upset about shit
but seriously what a emo.
Oh HAHAHAHA someone that
I’ve barely ever heard of said
something that, out of context,
could sound a bit gay. How in-
credibly witty and insightful.
Some top notch comedy work
there. Good to see the stan-
dard of writing isn’t deteriorat-
ing at all at Felix. Seriously
who the fuck thought that shit
could replace Twatter?
The trouble with running for
Felix Editor is that if you win
you are expected to actually
do it. Turns out this requires
a lot of work and isn’t all
like the life of Tiger Woods
(sinking putts and slamming
sluts). If you want to write
next year you will be required
to do some pretty disgusting
things (clean the Felix office).
Has someone stolen your lap-
top? If yes then more than like-
ly he is in hot pursuit of them.
Chavs fear him the world over.
Their fingers shake as they put
their cigarettes and Lambrini
to their mouths. He’ll chase
them down like Ryan Giggs
chases Imogen Thomas. Ex-
cept when caught they’re only
fucked metaphorically.
Even if he was drinking to his
new role at the Natural History
Museum it’s unlikely he’d be
draped in people wanting to
help him celebrate. In fact, I
feel sorry for the guy. Maybe
we should all send him flow-
ers as a goodbye present. Ac-
tually, he would probably just
throw them in the bin... crafty
so and so...

Biggest Badass James Fletcher
Numerous biology lecturers were cut.
This means that there are biologists who
STILL have jobs. This is a travesty, who
needs biologists? Don’t even get me
started about bio-I wasn’t good enough
to be a medic-al sciences.
2. Mechanical
Engineering Steel
Did you not say galvonised steel? Sorry
I must have had that Beastie Boys song
Galvonise in my head when I placed the
order. Those kind of blunders would get
you a big fat fail and a kick in the balls
if you’re a Mech Eng undergrad.
3. Felix Sex Survey
I know how to get the most accurate re-
flection of sex. Let’s ask men to tell us
how often they have it. They will defi-
nitely all be completely truthful. Result-
ing in Materials being the biggest wank-
ers. Has nobody ever met any medics?
4. Aeronautical
Engineering Flood
I know water cooling is good for com-
puters, but I don’t think it works for en-
tire labs. Maybe they just wanted to do
some swimming while conducting ex-
periments. Treading water while mak-
ing notes is a bit annoying though.
5. Old cars cut in
computing error
Computer said “no”. Some said
“NOOOO not the old cars!!”. Most said
“I don’t give a fucking shit I have a lab
report to finish, and then plan on getting
drunk”. The error was fixed. Thank-
fully, or there would have been a riot...
Leonardo Society
Shouting “Surprise Sex!” doesn’t make it ok...
We still have no idea what’s going on here...
