played out a largely scrappy affair, a
surprise considering the players’ cali-
bre. Bogdan started nervously, perhaps
a reflection of the importance of the oc-
casion with the match being recorded
and, for the first time, scored live on
the club’s web site, and eventually lost
the opening frame. Tim led marginally
throughout the next but a fluked pink
drew Bogdan level. A neatly composed
18 clearance—the highest break of the
match—saw Bogdan pinch frame four
and an early 30-point advantage in the
fifth soon resulted in the Freshers’Tour-
nament 2010 champion advancing to his
second final this season.
By contrast, the second semi-final
was more entertaining, although the
55-minute first frame was full of safety
play, where Richard slowly built up a
22-point lead that Bilal nudged to zero
before stealing the frame with a 15
break to the pink. The story was much
the same in frame two, however Bilal
turned on the style in the third to record
the second-highest break of the tourna-
ment, a well-crafted 46 in a brilliant
display of break-building. He might
have cleared up in a subsequent break
but, unaware of the rule preventing the
use of a ball off the table to determine
whether a colour would spot after being
potted, he was stopped prematurely for
this unusual foul.
It made no material difference to that
frame nor the next as two 16 breaks al-
lowed Bilal to open up a 40-point gap
before Richard could pot a ball. Yet, in a
reversal of the first two frames, Richard
played his best snooker of the match in
scoring breaks of 25 and, with a fluke-
assisted blue, 21, but a couple of loose
safeties quickly enabled Bilal to take the
frame to a re-spotted black. After a long
pot attempt, Richard was unfortunate
to double-kiss the black when he tried
to play safe, leaving Bilal a straightfor-
ward pot into the top-left corner pocket
to conclude the game.
So the two best players are five frames
away from becoming Imperial’s top
cueist. They share the highest 11 breaks
of the Internal League, headed by a 53
from Bogdan in the first group stage,
and have only lost three of the 43 frames
they have played between them. If the
players reproduce the quality of snooker
they have demonstrated this season, we
will be treated to an enthralling match
worthy of any final.

tistics and text commentary of the final

Murray mania makes
annual trip to SW19
... Continued from Back Page
The cries that ring differ only by the
forename. The shouts of ‘come on Tim’
have been replaced by ‘come on Andy’.
The weight, expectation and hope
placed on these three words weigh just
as heavily as they have ever done. The
annual frenzy surrounding Wimbledon
every year has begun. The nation fol-
lows with baited breath to see if we will
finally have a British Wimbledon cham-
pion after so many years of waiting. I
shall not be among them.
Firstly, let’s start with the ‘British’
Champion. Murray is Scottish and
when, in the 2006 football World Cup
England faced off against Trinidad and
Tobago (Scotland didn’t qualify), Mur-
ray publically stated his support for
T&T. Okay, support who you want but
remember Andy, the majority of those
supporters who turn up at SW19 willing
you to win are English. In fact most of
your fan base are likely to be English.
It’s best not to alienate them.
We can then seamlessly link to Mur-
ray’s public persona, anyone who has
every seen a television interview by
Murray is unlikely to remember it. In
fact, they are more likely to have had a
snooze. Win or lose Murray shows no
emotion. His interviews drone on in a
monotonous bored moan, in stark con-
trast to the eloquent and charming Rog-
er Federer. Rafa Nadal is not the most
eloquent of individuals, lest us forget
English is not his first language, yet
some argue that could be the case with
Murray too. It’s not true that Murray is
devoid of emotion; he got rather quite
upset following his loss in the US Open
Final. Much like that malignant growth
John Terry did following Chelsea’s fail-
ure to capture the Champions League in
Moscow.
Returning to Murray’s petulance on
court. He’s already shown his child -ike
behavior in his first game of this year’s
tournament. Shouting in exasperation,
swinging his racquet at the ground in
faux McEnroe anger, never capturing
the charm and charisma of the original
rebel of the tennis world. It’s embarrass-
ing to watch Murray behave in such a
way. Murray showed his weak tempera-
ment in the French Open this year when
up against the clay court specialist;
Nadal. Whilst Murray wound himself
up more and more, Nadal stared at him
from across the court and physically
wore Murray into the ground. It was a
joy to watch. Playing against Nadal is
said to be like hitting a ball against a
brick wall; it will always come back.
Nadal’s style of play, his unwillingness
to compromise his superstitious routines
make him a popular, charismatic player.
Murray and charismatic will never be
used together unless the prefix of ‘un’
makes an unusual Ménage à trois.
Murray probably will win a Grand
Slam title; the once invincible Federer’s
power’s are in decline, Nadal has had
some lengthy injuries, whilst Djokovic
could succumb to Murray’s game. Until
that time comes, I shall revel in semi-
final disappointments and heartbreaks
whilst fist pumping and shouting ‘va-
mos’.
upwards of 50 now, not to mention the
obvious relief from the stresses of aca-
demic life they provide.
We were sorry to say goodbye to Alis-
sa Ayling in the early part of the year.
Her role was key in facilitating the part-
nership of the Union and Sport Imperial,
and has helped our clubs to climb ever
greater heights. Fortunately, Hannah
Blandford has filled the role with great
skill, and we look forward to working
closely with her in the coming years.
The ACC is set to have an all new
committee next year, with Henry Abbot
and Phil Sandwell taking the reins as
Chair and Treasurer. The current com-
mittee is moving on, with some graduat-
ing, and some moving on to Sabbatical
positions in the Union. So if anything
does go wrong, we’ll be watching.
A final note of thanks has to go to the
members of all our ACC clubs. It seems
facetious to say, but without them, the
ACC would not be where it is now. Spe-
cial thanks go to all the club commit-
tee members for their continual dedica-
tion to their clubs throughout the year,
allowing their players to be able to do
what they do best: play and win. We
hope all our members have a fantastic
summer, and wish them all the best.
