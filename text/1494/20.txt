A
YEAR
OF
FELIX
WE
PRINTED
500,000
SQ
METRES
OF
PAPER
That’s
enough
to
cover
the
Queen’s
Lawn
415
times
All
that
paper
weighs
approximately
18
tonnes.
That’s
the
same
as
three
African
elephants
If
you
stacked
up
every
copy
that
we’ve
printed...
YOU
WOULD
FORM
A
TOWER
3KM
HIGH
That’s
33
times
taller
than
the
Queen’s
Tower
