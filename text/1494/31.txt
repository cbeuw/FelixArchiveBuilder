COMMENT
I
’m not one for blowing my own
trumpet, but sometimes when
I look down on this sprawling
metropolis of science and soccer,
of museums and Metro newspa-
pers, I think we can feel a modicum of
pride. I’m not talking about just London
though. It’s everyone, the whole human
race! When I think about what we’ve
achieved, I have to say that humanity’s
pretty great.
And how did we find ourselves in this
most envious position? Was it through
strength? Um, no, we’re actually pretty
weedy, especially compared to our dis-
tant cousins, the gorillas. They could
easily rip your whole arm off. If spe-
cies success was measured on strength
alone, we’d barely get an honourable
mention. But in reality, we are gracious
winners. It’s good to see more and more
gorillas finding employment as club
bouncers.
Well, maybe it was our flighty feet that
gave us the evolutionary edge? Again,
not so. Humanity is the asthmatic kid of
evolution, always getting picked last for
P.E. – we’re not even in the same league
as the likes of the leopard.

leave a legacy in a language written in
more than just A, G, C and T.
But our minds have a dark side also.
With such a grand capacity to think, we
are so vulnerable to over-thinking. We
can take one event, one comment, and
torture ourselves over its most absurd
interpretations. This is the price for our
mental agility; Mr Hyde to our other-
wise fantastic Dr Jekyll.
And even when we’re thinking
straight, our minds can be our stern-
est critics. We set impossible standards
– the only ones worth reaching for –
and crucify ourselves when we fail to
reach them. We could be the brightest
spark, but if we can’t please ourselves,
then everything else is worthless. The
reverse can be just as true; sickening
sycophancy only builds up illusions of
greatness.
But these are just blemishes on what
is truly a beautiful mind. I am willing
to pay in psychosis and neurosis for all
we have gained, and have yet to gain,
from this brilliant collection of electri-
cal impulses and ion imbalances. Could
a flagellar motor do that?
Think about it!
But there isn’t a secret order of leop-
ard high elders controlling the sum of
world politics behind the scenes (prob-
ably). How come? It is because, though
we are not the fastest or the strongest,
we are the smartest. From a little clump
of tapioca-mush in our heads spring all
of humanity’s achievements. This is
why I think we’re pretty groovy; the en-
tire sum of art, philosophy and science
has arisen from a few thousand years of
semi-random electrical discharges.
Soaking up mankind’s finest endeav-
ours, I can almost forget that we’re little
more than complex, over-complicated
machines for replicating lengths of a
sugar-base polymer.
It can be a bit of a downer to think that
purpose of life is just to beget more life
– no matter how fun the process may
be. But then I realised, because E=mc2
and Michaelangelo’s David have no
impact on passing on the genome, they
are more significant, not less. Einstein,
Monet, Nietzsche, Newton, Descartes.
Undeniably great men but where are
their children now? It is the fruit of our
minds, not of our loins that allow us to
achieve immortality. They allow us to
I
want it to be the year where your
Union makes a Guinness World
Record attempt.” “Vote for me
for better quality lecture notes.”
Sorry, what? Can you say that
again, please? I think my brain might
be haemorrhaging. I was expecting to
hear some realistic, sensible proposals
coming out of your mouth, but instead
all I’m registering is a massive pile of
crap. If you haven’t got it already, those
phrases up there are all extracts pulled
directly from the manifestos of next
year’s Sabbatical officers.
Just look at them. What do they even
mean? They’re either so vague and wool-
ly as to be pretty much meaningless, or
else they’re so badly thought out that
they’re unfeasible in practice. People
promise stupid things – one candidate
promised to campaign for a “freeze on
fees for international students.” Serious-
ly, what position do people think they’re
running for? – Rector? If not, then this
‘campaign’ is pretty much futile – I’d
like to see a Union Sabb forcing the
college out of hundreds of thousands of
pounds a year in the name of some ideal.
For many candidates, their manifesto
is just a big pack of lies – stuff they just
came up with to get your vote. I hold
the (somewhat cynical) view that many
candidates have no intention of keep-
ing any of their election promises be-
cause they know once they’re in power,
they can do pretty much whatever the
hell they like. After their year of ‘rep-
resenting our views’, they walk out the
door and disappear. I’m not saying the
elected officers don’t make a difference
– anyone remotely involved with the
Union knows that they do. The ques-
tion I’m asking is – did they make the
difference that they promised?
The short answer is that no-one
knows, or, at least, no-one bothers to
check. Once the year is done and dust-
ed, no-one looks at whether the elected
officers achieved what they promised us
they would, or whether they sat on their
thumbs all year.
What all this leads to is a system
where candidates can say one set of
things in their manifestos and then,
upon election, act completely different-
ly. This renders the whole democratic
process meaningless – if we can’t rely
on what candidates say they’ll do, how
do you choose who to vote for?
Clearly then, it is important that the
elected officers are held to account if we
want to bother with this whole voting
business. Felix doesn’t enjoy covering
it, because stories about Union politics
are boring and the majority of students
couldn’t give a toss anyway, so without
the voters themselves to dole out the
punishment, who else is left? Thank-
fully, there’s the Union Council.
Union Council voted last week to deny
the current Deputy President (Finance
and Services) an Honorary Life Mem-
bership of the Union, an accolade that
was given to the five other Sabbs. The
decision was quashed by Court because
the voting procedure was unconstitu-
tional and it still hasn’t been fully re-
solved, but I’m glad that Council did it.
This isn’t a poke at the DPFS himself – I
don’t know anything about his job and I
don’t know whether his performance de-
served such a ruling – I’m just glad that
the Union Council actually has the balls
to deny an elected officer such an award
if they think that it isn’t deserved.
It means that someone is holding
people to account, and is smacking them
down if they’ve done a bad job.Although
it’s a tiny decision in the grand scheme
of things, it shows that their heart is in
the right place. If elected officers are
finally being held to account for their
performance in office, it means that we
might actually be starting to move away
from a culture of nonsense manifesto
points and Sabbaticals who can do what
they want. Ultimately, that’ll lead to a
more meaningful election process and,
therefore, a better Union for everyone.
A
ndy Murray may have
made his name as
a great British and
mediocre interna-
tional tennis player
but when it comes to fending
off burglars (otherwise known
as false alarms) he really
ought to leave it to the pros.
Kim Sears, his girlfriend,
questions Murray’s decision
to defend her honour with a
tennis racket...
Murray: I was just lying in
bed when I realised that there
was a burglar trying to at-
tack my girlfriend. My racket
was obviously my weapon of
choice. Haven’t you seen what
I can do with that thing?
Kim: No way is a racket any
use against a burglar. What
were you thinking Andy?
Murray: I was thinking I’d
catch him off guard with a
good smash, rather than my
signature dropshot that I al-
ways use even though Rafa
and Roger can reach it, no
problem.
Kim: First it was all that Play-
station and now it’s tennis.
I’ve had enough of your frolick-
ing. You say it’s your life but
when you gonna win one of the
big tournaments?
Murray: That’s not what you
were saying last night, remem-
ber? About how you were go-
ing to give me my first grand
slam? That was the whole rea-
son my racket was in bed in
the first place!
Kim: Yeah, well what applies
in role-play doesn’t apply IRL.
For example, last night I was
actually picturing your big bro.
Murray: What!? I’m defo su-
perior to Jamie.
Kim: Well, at least he’s won
Wimbledon.
Murray: But that was only
doubles - I work alone baby.
And it was MIXED doubles at
that! Everyone knows women’s
tennis is just a glorified fash-
ion show.
