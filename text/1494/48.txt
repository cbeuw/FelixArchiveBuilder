Internal League
James Carver
ICU Snooker’s biggest annual tourna-
ment, the Internal League, reaches its
conclusion tomorrow with a stellar line-
up in the showpiece final.
Last Thursday, number two seed Bilal
Nasim produced a fine display of talent
in his 4–0 victory over Richard Stroud,
while top seed Bogdan Cozmaciuc
overcame two-time finalist Tim Ma four
frames to one in the first semi-final.
The competition started with 38 play-
ers in nine groups before it split into
two events where players were drawn
into groups of similar ability. The best
players in each event qualified for their
respective knockout stage.
The seeded draw for the main Cham-
pionship knockout resulted in some fas-
cinating fixtures. Hari Arora, hero again
in leading Imperial to win the Team Tro-
phy at the BUCS Snooker Champion-
ships last term, ended Bogdan’s run of
24 consecutive frames won in internal
competitions but still could not avoid a
3–1 quarter-final defeat, with the Roma-
nian scoring breaks of 37 and 28.
Two quarter-finals went the distance,
with defending champion Sam Den-
nis missing two match balls in his epic
game against Richard, in which four
frames were settled on the final black.
Sam misjudged the pink to give away
the fourth frame. Then, having come
back from needing three snookers to tie
the decider, he attempted a long black
that bounced out of the jaws and rested
near the opposite corner pocket to leave
Richard a straight pot using the rest,
causing arguably the biggest upset of
the tournament.
In the semi-finals, Bogdan and Tim

progress
As we reflect on the year gone by, the
ACC has a lot it can be proud of. In
terms of sporting achievement, this
looks set to be a record year for our per-
formance in BUCS, not to mention the
successes of clubs competing outside of
BUCS.
The Judo Club brought four bronze
medals and a gold back from their cham-
pionships. Baseball won the Southern
Championship and the Fall Cup, estab-
lishing themselves as a formidable team
in the region. Football came second
in the ULU League and won the ULU
Cup, and the water polo teams have var-
iously won their leagues, reached their
finals and gained promotion, including
the mixed team being crowned champi-
ons of the London League.
Dance have also been very success-
ful. Special mention goes to Arman
Sahovic, who came first and second in
the National University Latin and Ball-
room competitions respectively, the first
dancer in the university circuit ever to
do so. Boat have brought record num-
bers of medals home, with victories
in all classes. At the BUCS 4s and 8s
Heads, they won four golds, two sil-
vers and four bronzes, earning second
place overall and more than 100 BUCS
points.
The greatest success this year has
come from Imperial’s Fencers. Both the
men’s and women’s teams were unde-
feated throughout the season, winning
the league and having their best season
so far. Furthermore, having won silver
at last year’s BUCS Championships,
they went one better and won double
gold, finding themselves crowned as the
best fencing team in the country. Their
star players, Hannah Bryars and Maiy-
uran Ratneswaran (Sportsperson of
the Year) are both members of the GB
Olympic team, and Maiyuran is a gold-
and silver-medal winner at the Com-
monwealth Games. In addition, Alice
Mitchell, who lead the women’s team
to victory, also won a bronze medal in
Judo on the same weekend.
The ACC has also had a great year off
the pitch. We have run four very suc-
cessful ACC Bar Nights. These have
raised money that goes straight back to
the ACC so that it can help support the
activities of its many clubs, which are
