Two Girls One Cup. It’s shit...
James Simpson
Two Girls One Cup is a scatological
fantasy drama centered around a
solitary cup, which is shared by the
two girls named in the title. Produced
by Brazilian company MFX Media in
2007, it is the notorious work of the self-
described “compulsive fetishist” Marco
Fiorito. What a dirty bastard he is.
Originally intended as a trailer for
the (now apparently banned) film
“Hungry Bitches”, Two Girls One Cup
is at its most efficacious when viewed
immediately after a meal. Particularly
if that meal consisted of chocolate ice
cream.
The opening scene manifests itself
to the viewer much like the average
lesbian pornographic movie would (I
assume...). The two main characters are
kissing to the soundtrack of “Lovers’’
Theme” from Gerard Oury’s 1971
film “Delusions of Grandeur”. The
audience are then transported via the
medium of a rapid crossfade to the
debut appearance of The Cup. The Cup
is proffered unwillingly to the anus, as if
blissfully unaware of what it is about to
receive, and then, in a fleeting moment
of cataclysmic defecation, its purpose
becomes apparent.
In the now infamous words of the
Ugandan Pastor Doctor Martin Ssempa,
the two girls then proceed to eat da poo
poo, like ice cream, like ice cream.
Rather than summarily vomiting, the
Two Girls find the need to induce
physical sickness by means of the
pharyngeal reflex. This, I summise, is
rather strange given that they have both
just engaged in an act of mutual fecal
consumption.
Logic, it seems, is precluded here.
One might suspect that the motive
behind the vomiting may be to expel
the ingested detritus, but the disgorged
filth is poured unceremoniously into the
mouths of the Girls and onto The Cup,
which is still brimming with recently
excreted fecal matter. The Cup is then
utilised without delay as the source of
this egregious, bilious mixture, which
becomes the catalyst for an intense
sequence of lustful undertakings.
The screen fades to black and I can
stop peeking through my cardigan. The
sixty-second clip is probably the most
coprophagia I have witnessed since
Nick Clegg had to eat his own words
over tuition fees. There is (I am told)
a conspiracy surrounding the origin
of the brown substance which is so
voraciously gorged upon by the Two
Girls - apparently it’s ice cream. Fiorito
allegedly uses chocolate ice cream in
some of his movies, to “appease some
of his actors who [are] willing to appear
in scat films but not actually eat fecal
matter”. I hope so. Don’t watch it.
G
iven that we have
months of freedom in
which one could watch
anything one wanted to
on TV, I thought that I
might bring back a brilliant and unique
series from the depths of Dave and
Dave-ja-vu.
Blackadder – which stars the
hilarious Rowan Atkinson in its title
role – is a fantastic sitcom based
around Edmund Blackadder (a butler)
and his Dogsbody, Baldrick - played
by Time Team’s very own Tony
Robinson. Considering the abundance
of rarely-bettered one-liners such as
“AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU OR DID
SOMEONE JUST PUT A CANOE IN
MY POCKET?” I’d be surprised if you
hadn’t heard of it before now.
Throughout the latter three series (I’m
discounting the first one because it’s
generallyacceptedthatitisn’tverygood)
Edmund and Baldrick are surrounded
by a variety of other characters, played
by such big names as Stephen Fry, Hugh
Laurie and Rik Mayall (right) as Lord
Flashheart (Series 2, Episode 1). My
mother fancies him.
I don’t think I could possibly ever
reccommend any series more. Seriously,
watch it!
Currently on BBC1 is the second
series of the award-winning detective
drama Luther. Starring Idris Elba of
The Wire fame and written by Neil

Unmissable.

suicide is not all it seems. The second
part follows on Monday at 2100.
Monday | 2100 – 2200 | BBC2 |

natural selection. A man seeks help with
his moobs.

Luther
Award-winning crime drama. DCI John
Luther takes a long-overdue holiday
which is punctuated by violent crime
and blackmail. Thrilling and a bit scary.
Wednesday | 2100 – 2200 | BBC1 |
The Apprentice
A group of people sit in a shiny room
Two girls in one cup, not quite the same thing.
Cross of Spooks, Luther is one of the
coolest and slickest cop dramas around.
The plot is aligned around the fact that
the viewer knows the guilty party from
the beginning, which can be quite frus-
trating at times, especially when I don’t
have any fingernails left afterwards.
John Luther is an angry and agressive
man, and it seems that he is only kept
on by the Force because of his brilliant
intuition.
This quite typical layout would with
an average cast become rather banal,
but Elba is exceptional and this is what
makes this series stand out from the
crowd.
Finally, don’t get me started on the
bloody Apprentice. Sixteen twatty
people vie for the role of Lord Sugar’s
‘Apprentice’ which, he says, carries a
six-figure salary (he probably includes
a couple of decimal places, the stingy
bastard). Most of the candidates claim
to be good at ‘business’, whatever that
is, and all of them seem to have egos
to match Sugar’s ill-deserved self-love.
Watching it makes me angry.
James Simpson tries to forget the horrors of lolshock.com
“a fleeting moment
of cataclysmic
defecation”
“My mother
fancies him”
“She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a man’s
tonsils”
On the Box
What to look out for on TV in the next week
with a big table and make dicks of
themselves to a soundtrack of suspense
music. Sugar challenges the candidates
to design a new brand of biscuit, paving
the way for plenty of twee biscuit-
related puns.
Thursday | 2220 – 2320 | Channel
4 | The Sex Researchers
An examination of bizarre claims made
by researchers. The idea that the man’s
penis has evolved for cheating, the
existence of a cheating gene, and the
suggestion that that it is possible to pick
out gay men in a crowd are investigated.
I guess the researchers must be women
then.
Luther: built like a brick shithouse.
