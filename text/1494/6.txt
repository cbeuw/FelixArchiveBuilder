F
elix has set
up an online
feedback form
so that you
can tell the
Union exactly what you
thought of the Summer
Ball if you went, and can
explain what deterred
you if you decided not
to. Whether you want
to praise, criticise
constructively, or vent
your frustrations, go to
www.felixonline.co.uk/
summerball and let us
know what you think.
We have decided not
to ‘review’ the Summer
Ball (beyond reporting
the facts on Page 3
and printing photos of
students looking silly
on the next four pages)
so that the discourse is
driven by your opinions,
not ours. The Deputy
President (Finance &
Services)-elect Michael
Foster has told Felix
that student input,
opinion and feedback
will determine any deci-
sions made about next
year’s Summer Ball so
make sure to speak up.
The feedback form
will up for two weeks
(until the 8th of July),
after which we will start
analysing the results.

No umbrella? Didn’t you read the forecast? Rookie error...
See, these guys knew what they were doing...
