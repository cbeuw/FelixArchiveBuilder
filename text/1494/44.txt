FELIX
32 Friday 24 JUNE 2011
F
ortunately for his
family, Kendall’s
face and body was
completely unrecog-
nizable. They could
have the open-casket funeral
they had always wanted. The
cause of death is known: a furi-
ous attack by a swarm of blue
tits; the reason for his death is
still a mystery.
He was last seen alive in the
Hoop and Toy in South Kens-
ington, where he was reportedly
telling an old lady that he was
willing to “cross her crevasse”
and show her his “balls” – his
ability with puns and innuendo
was, sadly, limited.
One punter recalls him leaving
the pub: “Well he just suddenly
picked up this massive rucksack,
grabbed what looked like a pick-
axe, and ran out screaming ‘I’m
going for a walk, I’ll be back in
three months!’”
His body was found outside
the Natural History Museum,
with no clues to why a swarm
of blue tits decided to tear his
skin apart. All that was found
at the scene was a note that
said, “Where are your precious
plants now! Eh? See what I did
there…”
Kendall is survived by his
mail-order wife and their two
children. His wife was said to
be relieved by his passing, tell-
ing a Hangman Reporter: “He
never paid his bills, never paid
his telephone bills, never paid
his automo-bills.”

U
ltimately, it was
a dildo that did
for David Smith.
He had been
on a downward
spiral of back-alley encounters
and petty crime as his addiction
grew worse and worse during
his time as President. What be-
gan as a hilarious prank during
Medic Fresher Week, ended with
a “dildo too far” for the Medic
President.
He was found in a cubicle in
the girls’ bathroom of Reynold’s
Bar. The poor girl who found his
body said that his face was “con-
torted in ecstasy” and that the
dildo hanging out between his
legs was “easily as thick as my
arm, no joke.”
His friends, sorry, acquaintanc-
es... Ok the stranger he had been
begging to hang out with him,
told Hangman that he seemed ag-
itated throughout the evening. “I
just thought he was some kind of
crack addict or something. I was
wondering why he had an Ann
Summers bag full of dildos, but
its Reynolds Bar, you get used to
random shit like that.”
An inquest into his death ruled
that he died “hilariously” and ad-
vised that his body be left where
it was found for amusement.
However, the manager of Reyn-
olds was having none of it, tell-
ing a Hangman reporter, “I can’t
just leave a cubicle occupied
forever, where will people throw
up?” before adding, “You’re not
from the Daily Mail, are you?”
C
lubs and societ-
ies at Imperial re-
joiced last week
as Heather Jones
finally succumbed
to the world’s first DDOS attack
aimed at a human being. After
months of flooding her email in-
box with thousands of inane and
ridiculous questions, Jones final-
ly gave up the ghost; champagne
corks were heard popping across
campus as a doctor confirmed
that she had died of “sheer te-
dious administration.”
The email that is said to have
‘broken the camel’s back’ was a
request for advice after a club of-
ficer realised that he had missed
the last tube home and wanted
to know if there was a bus that
could take him from Notting Hill
to Clapham. Heather’s response
was unfinshed, but she appeared
to have been telling him to go
fuck himself in the politest way
possible.
One club chair told a Hang-
man reporter that all their
emails asking for help with just
about everything under the sun
were part of a plan to slowly
grind Jones down. “When you
want to bring a server down,
you send loads of requests to
it and eventually it can’t cope.
Now imagine that Heather was
a server, well... you know what
I’m getting at.”
Heather is survived by her
desktop computer, toothbrush,
and thousands of unreplied
emails...
K
evin Costner
spoke of his
pain yesterday,
on learning that
his life-long
friend and colleague Alex Da-
hinten had finally succumbed
to the flesh-eating virus that
he had been battling for years.
Many of his close friends were
taken aback by the news, hav-
ing been completely unaware of
his affliction. When it was ex-
plained that no-one had known
because it had mainly affected
his groin, they responded,
“Duuuuuuude.”
Dahinten had been a tireless
campaigner on behalf of Im-
perial students, and received
a great deal of attention from
girls on campus. One former ad-
mirer told a Hangman reporter,
“Ohhhh, that’s why he wouldn’t
let me go any further...” When
shown a picture she threw up
on the spot, ran away screaming
and hurled herself off the near-
est rooftop. Her last words were
believed to be, “THERE IS NO
GOD!”
It is not known where Dahinten
picked up the terrible virus, but
he managed to hide his affliction
from all of those around him.
“I once heard him screaming in
pain in the bathroom,” said Alex
Kendall, “but I just thought he
was having an almighty wank.
Actually, come to think of it, he
probably was...”
Dahinten is survived by tubs
and tubs of soothing cream.
E
ven though she had
created a Face-
book group, and
put posters around
campus, it took
three weeks for anybody to no-
tice Charlotte’s campaign stall
outside the JCR, and sadly, a
further four months for anyone
to notice that she had passed
away while manning the stall.
When informed of her death,
one student said, “I literally
have no idea what the fuck
you’re talking about.”
A enthusiastic spokesperson
on welfare issues, Charlotte had
increased awareness about sexu-
al health, drug safety, and alco-
hol issues among literally tens of
Imperial students.
The cause of death is still be-
ing investigated but a prelimi-
nary coroner’s report recorded
“stomach-churning” levels of
amphetamines, alcohol, and
crack cocaine. Charlotte was
said to be a big proponent of
the ‘method-acting’ approach to
welfare issues.
The Union is launching an in-
quiry into how nobody noticed
that Charlotte had been miss-
ing for so long. Further contro-
versy has been ignited as it has
emerged that Heather Jones ac-
tually took back the table being
used for the stall, but failed to
notice Charlotte’s cold corpse.
When asked how she didn’t no-
tice, Heather Jones responded,
“what email?” before shaking
her head angrily.
R
eports from the Ca-
ribbean island of
Barbados suggest
that Ravi Pall has
been killed by a
falling coconut that landed on his
head. The Deputy President had
been holidaying there before the
Summer Ball but had not been
heard from for a couple of weeks.
One member of Council asked if
this meant that they didn’t have to
give him Honorary Life Member-
ship, but when informed that con-
stitutionally there was no reason
why death should be a barrier to
Honorary Life Membership the
Council member was reported to
have said, “Ah fuck.”
Ravi Pall was a dedicated ser-
vant of the Union, and was be-
lieved to have spent literally tens
of hours in his office in the past
year. His holiday to Barbados
had aroused some controversy,
with one Trinidadian student
complaining, “Oh Barbados?
Are you saying there’s some-
thing wrong with Trinidad? Fuck
Imperial.”
The Union have denied that
there is any policy of discrimi-
nation against Trinidadians but
reassured Hangman that Ravi’s
death would not affect the run-
ning of the Union in any way.
Pall’s family have decided to
have him buried in Barbados in-
stead of shipping him back to the
UK. Explaining their decision,
his mother said: “You know
when you’re happy, but you
shouldn’t be? .... yeeeeeah...”
The Sabbs have been “working hard” all year, and were only days away from retirement when they met their sticky ends.
Hangman remembers them, and examines their legacies...
