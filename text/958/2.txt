Alien sparks trouble Da Vinci's winner
by our N e w s Staff
Controversy has broken out
between two Imperial College
Union (ICU) societies over
proposed screenings of the film
'Alien 3'. I C U FilmSoc and ICU
Science Fiction Society both
planned to show the film in the
same week, and to charge an
admission fee for the respective
screenings.
The confusion over the
screenings led to ill-feeling between
both societies, neither of whom
were happy over the other's
decision to show the film. The
sldrrnishing eventually led to claims
of copyright infringement. By
charging admission fees, I C U
FilmSoc was said to be in
contravention of an agreement with
the film distributors. ICU Science
Fiction Society was accused of
breaking copyright laws by
planning to charge for showing a
video of 'Alien 3'. The dispute was
exacerbated by ICU FilmSoc's
charging both members and non-
members for admission to a
particular film. Both sides
threatened to call in the police.
A resolution was reached after
the intervention of ICU officers.
ICU Science Fiction Society will
now show James Cameron's
'Aliens', and the Society's members
will be allowed into the FilmSoc
screening of 'Alien 3', at the same
entrance fee as FilmSoc members.
Felix has been told.that, after taking
legal advice, ICU also ruled that the
Science Fiction Society should not
charge an entrance fee for their film
screenings.
The Result of the 'Drink your way

William Waldegrave, the Science
Minister, paid a private visit to
Imperial College on Wednesday
morning. Mr Waldegrave toured
the Interdisciplinary Research
Centre (IRC) for Process Systems
Engineering. Martin Bell, Mr
Waldegrave's Private Secretary,
said that the minister wanted to see
the centre's facilities, and 'discuss
the interface' between science and
industry. M r Waldegrave was
impressed with the IRC's 'excellent
applied research', and 'the
education of both Post- and
Undergraduates'.
Account clampdown
Ovens out of halls
by J a c o b A n d e l i n
Residents of Beit Hall New Hostel
have complained this week about
the redesign of their kitchens. A
new College Estates Division policy
dictates that grills and ovens are to
be omitted when a kitchen is
refurbished. This has already
happened in the newly refurbished
Holbein House, although Holbein
residents have the use of one oven
on the ground floor.
The New Beit Hostel residents
are only able to use the oven in the
old hostel, which involves a walk
across Beit Quad. The complaints
of Hostel residents have been taken
up with the College Housing
Committee.
Raman Kamani, an MSc student
living in Beit Hall this year, said
that the majority of students were
dissatisfied with the lack of ovens
and grills. He added that these cuts
were unhealthy, as it meant that
students would be frying more
food, and misusing microwaves,
leading to food poisoning. M r
Kamani did concede that the
kitchens were otherwise of a very
high standard.
College officials declined to
comment to Felix, but said that the
new policy would lead to an
increase in hygiene and safety.

Imperial College Union has this
week ruled that the possession of
private or external bank accounts by
clubs and societies - which is in
breach of regulations - will no
longer be tolerated. This could lead
to college disciplinary action against
those responsible for the
management of accounts in the club
or society that may be in breach of
this rule. A l l club and society
accounts are officially held centrally
by ICU to maintain their charitable
status.
IC Radio bid stopped
by J a c o b A n d e l i n
Imperial College Radio's
application for funds from the
Imperial College Trust has been
refused. The money would have
been used to obtain an F M licence.
IC Radio had originally planned to
have the F M licence for a trial
period around Fresher's Week this
October. A n F M licence costs four
thousand pounds for a two week
period, which includes the cost of
publicity and equipment. David
Cohen, IC Radio Station Manager,
told Felix that the station will be
approaching other organisations for
the money.
Government fails to halt hospital fears
by A T s e n g a n d D Curry
The fate of Charing Cross Hospital
is still unclear after this week's
Government response to the
Tomlinson report. The report,
which examined rationalisation of
London healthcare, recommended
last October that the Royal
Brompton and Royal Marsden
Hospitals should relocate to the
Charing Cross site, creating a
specialist cancer hospital.
Speaking to a packed House of
Commons on Tuesday, Virginia
Bottomley, the Health Secretary,
said that there was 'no financial case
for relocating' the specialist
hospitals to Charing Cross Hospital.
New proposals for Charing Cross
Hospital will now be drawn up in
consultation with the North West
Thames Regional Health Authority
(RHA).
The decision not to move the
Royal Brompton and Royal
Marsden Hospitals at the moment
was hailed by staff and patients at
both hospitals. Bill Bain, Royal
Brampton's Chief Executive, said
that the Royal Brompton is
'anxious' to discuss the organisation
of medicine in the Chelsea area.
Part of this reconstruction will
involve the formation of a new
'Chelsea Health Sciences Centre',
which will include Imperial
College. Mr Bain said the Centre
would 'provide the focus for a
campus style development, a
federal linking of Royal Brompton,
Royal Marsden, the new Chelsea
and Westminster Hospital, the
National Heart and Lung Institute,
the Institute of Cancer Research,
and Imperial College'. Mrs
Bottomley said that the
establishment of the Centre would
be 'the best way forward in the long
run', and said that the NHS could
not 'sustain extensive overlap or
duplication in this part of London'.
The plans for the new Chelsea
Health Sciences Centre builds on
earlier proposals for a merger
between Imperial College and the
Charing Cross Westminster
Medical School.
The Government response to the
Tomlinson Report also says that St.
Mary's Hospital in Paddington 'is
well sited in relation to its
population'. The Government adds
that 'redevelopment of the hospital
would have to be ranked alongside
other priorities'. Sir Bernard
Tomlinson originally said that St
Mary's Hospital should lose 200
beds, and part of the Paddington site
should be sold.
On medical education in London,
Mrs Bottomley said that Sir Bernard
Tomlinson's recommendations
'were widely supported', and 'are
in line with long standing policy' of
the University of London. Sir
Bernard proposed the merger of the
current nine hospital medical
schools to major colleges of the
University of London, forming four
medical 'superschools'. John
Patten, the Education Secretary, has
asked the Higher Education
Funding Council for England to
take the merger proposals 'forward,
working with those involved, to
ensure that health and education
changes march in step'. Mrs
Bottomley added that the Funding
Council would 'consider the issues
raised in the Tomlinson Report
about student numbers in London'.
The number of medical students in
London is expected to fall after the
implementation of Sir Bernard's
recommendations.
