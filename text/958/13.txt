This is New Model Army's first
single on Epic Records since their
departure (not before time) from
EMI. It's been a long time since
they released some original
material, but it was worth the wait.
This single contains the familiar
blend of their views (in the lyrics)
with great music (—better than
Gold Blend!).
The 12" and C D both carry a
simplified guide to making your
own nuclear weapon—so if you
want to get back to the IRA—then
this is the record for you.

Out now on Epic.
T h e L e m o n T r e e s — L e t it

This is spineless, gritless and totally
lacking sparks. All the notes fit but
nothing happens. The Lemon Trees
are a Lucy band, Airhead mark II.
Do something nasty boys! Or
you'll stink forever.

• Out now.
Kinky M a c h i n e —
Supernatural Giver
A Hendrix guitar line at the
beginning, a Beatles chorus and daft
lyrics lead me to conclude that
while mildly entertaining, Kinky
Machine are somewhat retro and
going nowhere.
Wait for Pablo Honey, and save
some dosh.

Massive in the clubs for ages now,
or so they say, following a very
limited white label release in
December, followed by a slightly
more available green sleeved
release last month, 'Conquistador'
is about to receive a full release.
And about time too. A quick listen
to any of the mixes, including the
three Weatherall/Sabres of Paradise
mixes, reveals why. 'Conquistador'
drifts in and out and all around your
head like a latin sensuality monster
from beyond the end of the
universe, Big Ben chiming around
in the Weatherall mixes, with its
'bababyaba' refrain catching you
unawares, so you end up singing it
on the bus out loud and getting
strange looks from the bus
conductor. Still, that might be the
hat.

• Out on Monday on Heavenly/
Columbia. Espiritu appear on The
Word tonight on Channel 4.
Rupert P a r k e r — D o u b l e Harp
Here is a man who wants to become
the Nigel Kennedy of his
instrument. Unfortunately you can't
do interesting things with a harp,
and Rupert doesn't look like the sort
of person who supports Aston Villa.
Most of 'Double Harp' is the usual
new age/jazz cross-over stuff you
can hear in any lift up and down the
country.

G h o s t of an A m e r i c a n
A i r m a n — 4
And now welcome to a four piece
archetypal guitar band called Ghost
of an American Airman. Oh dear.
What scope there is for a quick
burst of sarcasm before we've even
heard the record. Resisting this
temptation; three of Ghost etc's four
tracks on '4' (confused) are straight
up, no nonsense buzzing guitar
saturated thoroughfares, and a"
touch uninspired. The real peach is
'Freakshow' which is a far more
enlightened experience. It has all
the fun of the fair. A steady boogie
inspired tempo mixed with a dash
of old style harmonica for good
luck. They even sound like they're
enjoying themselves. Just change
that name.
Tintin.
