and it was all I could do now to
reach the ridge above at 4000
metres. From this sheltered position
Toubkal was so close - the survey
triangulation point could clearly be
seen. But despite its closeness we
were all drained and mindful of the
long treacherous descent - still
carrying the bike, which lay ahead.
The guide sat shivering beneath
my orange cape. We explained in
sign language that we would take
some pictures from here, and head
back. For the first time in my life,
I was content to watch a summit 200
metres above me and two miles
away and not needing to reach it.
The urge to climb had left me.
Moroccan Valediction
The C T M Volvo coach disgorged
us onto the dusty Casablanca
terminal at the dusky hour of
5.30am. We squatted in a shabby
corner, collecting our thoughts and
luggage as it materialised. In twenty
days we had cycled over 1000
kilometres, climbing a total of
12,000 metres in ten passes. We'd
had eight punctures between us in
our combined 3000 bike kilometres
and had suffered one broken hub,
ten broken spokes, a damaged gear
system, numerous lost chainset
teeth, and a snapped handlebar bag
carrier. Except for a few cuts and
bruises and fading memories of
food poisoning we had faired quite
well in the jaws of the High Atlas.
If there was one conclusion we
could make about this ridiculous
and so stubbornly British of
journies, was that mountain bikes
were not for mountains. Mountains
were for legs and feet to cross, not
wheels and peddles. Bikes needed
more than the bear minimum of
steep crumbling mule tracks, and
certainly are not built for raw
mountain sides. Luggage was
another matter, and the carrying of
it on bikes was only for the open
road!
