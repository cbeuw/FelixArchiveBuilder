Hellraiser I I I - H e l l o n Earth
Well, here it is. After a hellishly
(not a snigger please, not a word!)
long wait; Hellraiser III surfaces
from the bowels of hell (there I go
again!) quietly released amidst the
monotony of current movie bore.
Do you actually remember the
prequels? Hellraiser I was passably
horrific, though mostly
unmemorable, Hellraiser II was
even more of the same, a bit more
screamy and gory but as with most
sequels a shadow of its former
self. Now we have the third and
(hopefully) final instalment of the
Hellriaser trilogy to join the
plethora of horror (so they say)
movies around.
All I can say is why did they
bother, this has to be one of the
worst films I have ever had the
misfortune of seeing. Those who
enjoyed the first two in the trilogy
will undoubtedly want to absorb this
climax, but believe me you will be
disappointed. This film could,
indeed should, have applied for a
'straight to video' release. Yes, this
is the sort of film for those who still
find saying 'milky, milky' funny,
for those who get embarrassed
easily by the words 'Grunties' and
'Megaphone' and for those who
think the 'Wankel rotary engine' is
some sort of marital aid.
Plotwise, it's just another good
versus evil rant, and that as they say
is that. This third installment
desperately carries on from the
previous two, with Pinhead and his
bunch of cenobites walking the
earth again. Their one desire; to
reclaim the box and liberate
themselves from the powers of hell.
Only our heroine, a young
ambitious television reporter can
stop them. The rest is trivially
predictable. The acting comes
straight from Sesame Street—we're
taling Oak with a hint of Redwood
here.
Avoid this film at all costs, it is
a travesty, it IS tripe and it's hell
to watch.

B a d Lieutenant
The Bad Lieutenant is an N Y P D
cop addicted to crack, heroin and
alchohol. His debts force him to bet
everything on a baseball game.
Meanwhile he takes out his
frustration by sexually harassing
female members of the public and
getting high. Later, a nun is raped
and a reward offered for the arrest
of the culprits, which he pursues.
Filmed in the ragged, punky style
of Driller Killer, another of Abel
Ferrara's controversial pictures,
Bad Lieutenant views like a
documentary but has a sinister rap
soundtrack and a solid, moral story
to tell. Although the LT's depravity
knows no bounds (eg. mouthing
obscenities whilst frantically
masturbating over two young
female offenders) the film is
ultimately about Catholic virtues -
the L T managing to forgive the
rapists and the dying, himself
redeemed. Harvey Keitel gives a
breathtaking performance - one
wonders just how far he was
perpared to go to achieve realism.
If you haven't seena Ferrara film,
see this one - you're in for a shock.

A River R u n s T h r o u g h It
This one's a toughie to review...
what some may describe as artful,
haunting and beautiful, others may
say it's total shite and wonder why
it was ever made.
The cast are absolutely fabulous
with great character projection from
Brad Pitt and Tom Skerritt. If you
end up hating this film, it will not
be due to really slimy acting, but
probably due to the storyline. There
is nothing wrong with it, like in
some films where the links are
flimsy or nothing is really
explained, but there may not be
enough action to hold the bloody
thirsty among us. I think it hovers
cleverly between the two extremes
of deep and meaningful and light
hearted entertainment, and anyone
who dislikes this description, should
avoid this film.
