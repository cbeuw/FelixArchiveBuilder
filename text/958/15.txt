Greasepaint
kabuki face-mask in front of an
imaginary mirror.
Written by Inoue Hisashi and
directed by Kiochi Kimura
Greasepaint won every category in
Japan's top theatre awards when it
was first performed there in 1983.
And this is indeed a fine piece of
work, which is also contributed to
by the atmospheric design of
backstage mess.
Nevertheless, the night belongs to
Frances de la Tour. It is her plain,
sorrowful face, self-mocking
humour, the moments when we se
her in full constume in kabuki play,
that make us admire this
performance.
Make sure you will find time
before 6 March to go and see it.

Theatre
Greasepaint
This contemporary back-stage
drama is set in the tatty end of
Japanese theatre, the Taishu, or
variety show, often described as
working class theatre or kabuki.
Frances de la Tour plays Yoko
Satsuki, an ageing kabuki actress
and leader of a Taishu troupe. She
is rehearsing her invisible company
for that all important first night.
Although concerned with a rain-
filled sky threatening bad business,
and the debut of a new actor, Yoko
Satsuki is rallying her company on
to one last effort. Sudden
appearance of the son that she had
abandoned many years ago, now a
successful singer, makes the actress
want to reslove the agonies of her
past in an explosive fusion of life
and art. This all generates an
extraordinary dramatic tension.
And if that's not enough, the theatre
is also scheduled for demolition!
As the title suggests there is a
certain amount of face painting
going on, with Frances applying,
from the scratch, the distinctive
R o b i n — P r i n c e of S h e r w o o d
This show is quite pleasant: it can
best be described as a pantomime
sung through to rock-and-roll.
While hardly on the scale of
Phantom or Les Mis, the costumes
and set are attractive (though the
codpieces are rather overdone!)
Robin (Mike Holloway) and
Marion (Liz Curnick) are played
and sung well enough, but the
Sheriff (Peter Howarth) and
Morgana (Anne Smith), his witch,
steal the show, stalking around the
stage, and singing their souls out
(and selling them to Satan) to some
excellent music. This is one show
where the Devil has all the best
tunes!
In conclusion: an undemanding
and pleasant show; maybe not 1st
class, but quite possibly a 2:1.

This play is about three Americans
who guard the border to Mexico to
prevent illegal aliens from entering
their country. The very funny and
slightly weird style that is present
in the beginning drains away to
leave a drab finale that does not suit
the characters.
Separation
Full to the brim of subtle meanings
and complex dialogue, Separation
is strictly for masters of the English
language. In the ninety or so
minutes, Tom Kempinksi has
managed squeeze enough examples
of separation to make your head
spin. The actors perform the
various separations almost
perfectly, except for the panic
attack which was not as convincing
as it could have been, although I
was captivated for the entire
duration of the production. But as
I have said, there is so much that
can be read into this play that you
are left thinking about it for literally
days afterwards.

The 1993 OPSOC production
'Anything Goes' is correctly
described in the programme as a
song-and-dance show with a little
plot to stick it together.
The cast was mixed. Matthew
Soame (Sir Evelyn Oakley)
performed very well but his
character was rather unoriginally
interpreted. Laura Hudson (Bonnie)
was enthusiastic as a delightfully
dozy bimbo and Joanna Trip (Mrs
Harcourt) was marvellous as an
aging American lady. I must
mention Philip Hollman (Moonface
Martin) who carried his role almost
flawlessly and added a lot to the
show.
The orchestra was excellent
although at times tended to drown
out the singers. Gary Woolf (Billy
Crocker) has good diction as do
most of the cast, but I was a little
disappointed by Lyanna Iveson
(Reno Sweeny) who did not project
her voice well. The chorus numbers
were all of very well executed.
So all in all, a reasonable show
worth going to see your friends in.
Students get in for £2.50 so go
along and allow yourself to be
entertained.

The S n o w Q u e e n
This Hans Christian Andersen fairy
tale is magically brought to life by
choreographer David Bintley.
Performed in three acts the ballet
enchants. Starting with the
character-based fairground scene
where the Snow Queen bewitches
the small boy Kay and tries to
abduct him. Act II is ten years later;
on the eve of his betrothal to Gerda,
Kay is pierced by fragments of the
Snow Queen's mirror. In the final
act, Kay is captured and wooed by
the Snow Queen and the scene is set
in the amazing, sinister palace of the
Snow Queen.
The Birmingham Royal Ballet's
dancers give a beautifully inspired
performance flowing to music
based on a score by Russian
composer Musorgsky.
A superb production.

A blend of East and West using a
perfect synthesis of movement and
music.
The first part, 'Configurations',
features the distinctive music of
Michael Nyman played live on
stage by The Smith Quartet.
'Making of Maps' mixes Indian
classical music with electronic
sound. The simple, yet stunning
costumes capture the flowing
rhythm and movement to produce
an amazing visual effect.
The fusion of the powerful
gestures of Indian classical dance
with modern dance work incredibly
well without trying to Westernise
Indian dance or Easternise western
dance.
I strongly recommend this
production.

Put down your pen. Close your
notebook. Leave the lecturer to
waffle on profusely and book to see
this NOW! Ennio Marchetto is
merciless in his imitation of various
stars. He will leave you laughing
for days afterwards.
