About the arms trade
On Thursday 21st January ICU
Third World First showed a video
on C A A T (Campaign Against the
Arms Trade), a documentary on the
arms trade between the West and
the Third World and its adverse
affect on the economic and social
health of the developing countries.
For those who couldn't attend the
event, we write here a summary of
the major points.
Many developing countries, such
as India, Iraq and Turkey, spend a
large proportion of their budget on
the import of arms from the
industrialised countries. In some
cases they spend up to four times
the amount they spend on
education, health and agriculture
combined. These countries also
often obtain training for their
military personnel and technology
to start their own arms industry.
The U K is one of the biggest
exporters of arms, second only to
the US.
The effects on the importer of this
It's a world that seems to belong as
much to the distant past as it does
to the future, a monastic community
composed of violent criminals who
are the refuse of the universe. In
this society of outcasts a woman
would be the ultimate outcast: a
troublemaker, a temptation that has
been repressed, a member of
another species—an alien. Someone
to be feared, not trusted,
particularly when she tells an
incredible story about a deadly,
unstoppable enemy, and expresses
her own deepest fear: that the story
may not be over.
We are on Fiorina 161, a lice-
infested planet in a distant solar
system. A subterranean mineral ore
refinery and a maximum security
work-correctional facility, Fiorini
'Fury' 161 is unhabited by a
community of prisoners who found
religion and stayed behind when the
facility was evacuated. Into this

huge expenditure are devastating.
With so little left to spend on the
social services, the government is
unable to redress the social and
economic problems of the country.
This leads to increased
dissatisfaction of the people and the
formation of reactionary
movements which in turn compels
the government to increase its
military power in order to be able
to stifle political opposition.. .by the
further import of arms. For this to
be achieved either the social budget
is further compromised, or the
government borrows money and
increases its external debts. The
arms trade is then another
contribution of the net flow of
money out of the Third World. The
largest importers of arms are often

developed countries.
(On a more positive note, many
of the countries of South America
are only spending a small part of
their budget on arms.)

Weaver) in a malfunctioning EEV.
But Ripley has brought another
unwelcome visitor to Fiorina 161,
whose inhabitants have no advanced
technology or modern weapons to
fight back when the Alien once
again goes on the attack.
Let Filmsoc take you there next
Thursday in our Mech Eng class,
type 220, battle cruiser. We took
you there many years ago for Alien,
two years ago for Aliens, and now
you can see Alien 3 in glorious
cinemascope and improved sound at
7.30pm on Thursday 25th. A seat
can be yours for 90p (members) or
£1.90 (non-members) and with

real bargain at only £3.50 including

We cater for all abilities, from
people who have never even shot a
water pistol to those who hold
FAC's and we have a wide range
of guns from basic .22" semi-autos
up to a .44" magnum revolver and
a brand new .45" semi auto Glock
Regional arms races between
rival neighbouring countries (eg
India and Pakistan) occur because
neither country knows how much
the other is importing (in analogy
to the former East-West nuclear
arms race).
And then we have the U K -
second largest arms exporters,
dedicating a huge part of its
research budget and resources to
defence. It organises international
arms exhibitions, to which it invites
worldwide representatives, such as
the Iraqi directory of Armaments
and Supplies. It claims its
customer's human rights record is
taken into account before the
contract, but the purchasing
governments are often the most
repressive. Whereas formerly arms
sales by the West often had strategic
grounds, motives now seem to be
purely commercial.
The video ends with propositions
to reduce the arms trade. A U N
resolution has already been made to
On Monday, we are pleased to
conclude our Alien binge with our
presentation of Aliens: Special
Edition and Alien 3
Aliens: Special Edition is an
extended version of the classic
sequel featuring nearly 20 minutes
of footage previously unseen.
Among the reinstated sequences are
the colony as seen prior to the Alien
attack, Newt's parents first
encountering the face-huggers and
also Warrant Officer Ripley
revealing her first name as well as
the existence of her daughter!
Alien 3 is a bleak follow-up to the
first two films, closer in style to
Alien than Aliens. A beautiful credit
sequence shows a face-hugger
moving aboard the USS Sulaco, just
after the end of Aliens, instigating
a fire and causing the occupied
cryogenic tubes to be ejected in an
escape pod. After being woken,
Ripley is forced to fight the Alien
that accompanied the tubes, helped
by the residents of the planet the
pod lands on, the inmates of a
desolate penal colony, as the Alien

set up a register of arms sales.
Further, they propose that there
should be public information and
debate about all arms exports from
this country. That a rninister of state
should be appointed for the control
and phasing out of these exports.
That training of armed forces of
military regimes should stop. That
an immediate embargo should be
imposed on countries at war or not
meeting up to stringent criteria of
human rights records and so on.
Bombs that are used destroy
lives. Bombs that aren't are
destroyed anyway. The sooner the
huge resources of the arms research
industry and the skills of thousands
of workers are turned to more
fruitful purposes the better.

Trade not developed here is the

interested you are welcome to

picks them off one by one. A
growing threat, literally, is the
Alien 'hiding in the most terrifying
place of all'.
Members get in for 50p for one
film or 70p for both. Aliens: SE
starts at 6pm in Chem Eng LT1 and
Alien 3 at 8.45pm.
Also this week, we are proud to
be holding a presentation by the
well-known fantasy illustrator Josh
Kirby. Josh is probably best known
for his covers for Terry Pratchett's
novels, but his extensive work since
the 50s also includes Brian Aldiss's
and L Ron Hubbard's. The talk,
with many stills, starts at 6pm on
Thursday in Chem Eng LT1. There
will also be an opportunity to buy
his latest collection 'The Garden of
Unearthly Delights' and Josh would
be happy to autograph those and any
other books he has illustrated. Entry
to this event is 50p for existing
members, £1 for non-members,
whilst membership (£3) includes the
first 'event' entry (film, talk,
video...) free.
For further information keep
reading Felix or contact Myles W
A Davison through the Rifle and
Pistol pigeonhole in the Union
Office or through the Physics U G
pigeonholes.
