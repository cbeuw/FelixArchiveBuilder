Are you bemused by all this talk of

a European Free Market or do you just want to know how much booze you
braved a stormy Channel to find out.
Five o'clock a.m. This was the
day the four dedicated students had
been training for. We had been
drying out and avoiding pubs for,
well, hours now in anticipation of
the bargain revelry to come. The
car ground under way, and the other
three promptly passed out again.
Dover. Seven twenty. London
was never this cold. The icy gale
hurtled through the Western Port
car park, and we staggered to the
warmth of the ferry terminal.
Obviously the £6 for a day's
parking had been used productively.
Were we sure this wasn't
Heathrow? Those Marketing
Executives had done a storming job,
the compulsory check-in at least
half an hour prior to sailing means
that the exorbitant cafe does a
roaring trade.
Eventually, we were ushered to
the luxuriant interior of P&O's
Pride of Dover, and straight into the
Duty Free shop. What a spectacle
to behold! Student heaven. I
greedily stashed the bounty into the
absurdly small basket totting up the
savings - Green Chartreuse £8.25
(instead of £19.95), 200 Silk Cut
£12.75, a litre of Vladivar Gold
vodka (57%vol!) £9.75.. Paradise.
Ah. The cash desk. Despite the
removal of limits on tax-paid goods,
there is still a duty-free allowance.
'How many people are you
buying for?'
'Oh, loads,' came the reply,
'honest.'
You are allowed one litre of spirits
and 200 cigarettes per crossing but
wine is best bought in France.
Mais oui, la France. We're
certainly in Europe now. No
customs, no immigration, in fact
nobody at all. Even the most
disreputable illegal or visa-less
would have no difficulty strolling
down the abandoned corridor to a
life of freedom in France. Getting
back to Britain might prove a little
tricky, mind. One cramped courtesy

Good points about Calais:
• The shops are near the
ferry-port.
• Hypermarket Continent is
mega-cheap. The
Mammouth is a little more
sophisticated; catch a bus.
• Everybody speaks
English.
Bad points:
• The weather is just as bad
as in London.
• The cafes and buses are
as expensive as in London.
• Everybody speaks
English.
How to avoid getting your
passport checked in Dover:
• Stagger through with an
immense rucksack, your
arms full of beer-crates and
an upside-down anonymous
black book in your mouth,
A N D NEVER LOOK
T H E M IN T H E E Y E .
Our advice:

unleashed upon Calais.
What could be more French than
a breakfast of fresh croissant and
cafe noir in a streetside brasserie?
Except that everyone speaks
English, except us tourists who are
attempting what remains of our
French dredged up from those
'O'Level days. Why didn't those
teachers teach us anything useful,
such as how to ask when the bars
open, and if we can change our now
defunct 10 franc coins into
something more valuable? As if the
collapse of the pound isn't painful
enough. Your pound will only buy
8 francs, making town-centre prices
comparable to the West End.

So, how about some culture? We
surveyed the historic rubble from
the '40s and admired the ancient
'60s skyscrapers that replaced it.
Great. Where's the Hypermarket?
Ten miles out of town? What! There
is another on the east side of town.
Its a hefty and sobering stroll if you
can survive the maniacal French
motorists and non-existent
pavements. No wonder there isn't
a population problem - only the fit
survive into middle age. The rest
die from liver cirrhosis. These
prices are absurd! 50p for a bottle
of wine. At 12% vol, who cares if
it tastes like sour mouthwash?
You need a plan for the
Hypermarket alone. Continent is
Harrods for students, and
impoverished Sun readers out for a
quid. You can buy a TV, coffee set,
house-plants, bicycles, food and of
course booze. Within, the aisles are
barren as booze-craved Brits scurry
to the far depths of the store where
the beer is hoarded, well away from
more practical goods. The car-park
seemed solely occupied by British
registered Transits and Estates. The
British lout is unaccustomed to
exercise. Many neared cardiac
arrest as they clawed for crates of
Stella and Atlas at ludicrous prices.
Shelves were emptied as soon as
they could be restocked with wine
at as much as a pound a bottle.
Of course, there is good stuff for
the extravagant. For as much as
three pounds, you can buy a
superbly rich Merlot or classic
Bordeaux, but take care as French
supermarkets do not have as
discerning buyers as at home. The
problem of sampling can easily be
solved by buying several half
bottles, guzzling them outside the
shop and then returning rapidly
before the alcohol has too much
effect to stock up the rucksack.
Other bargains include port,
madeira and Scotch Whisky, but it
seems ironic that they should go to
all the trouble of exporting
wonderful malts to France just to
have us buy it back again for a
pittance. Then there's the chocolate,
the cheeses, the biscuits, the
pastries and of course the lemon
yoghurt drink. And they accept
English credit cards.
Carrying it all proved a handful
(excuse the pun). You tend not to
realise just how much twelve bottles
of wine will weigh when it's being
shunted in a trolley. Thank
goodness for the bus. 70p will get
you back to the town centre in time
to gorge your goodies before
returning home.
HOW MUCH
Petrol
London-Dover-London
180 miles.
P & O Dover-Calais:
Foot passengers, single or
3 day return £24, bicycles
free. Cars/minibuses (up to
6.5m) £40 to £125, car
passengers £15. Remember
to get insurance for the
Continent. This can be
expensive. Sailings every 45
to 90 minutes and through
the night.
WILL IT COST?
Stena-Sealink
Dover-Calais:
Prices as above but
students with an ISIC can
get foot passenger fares for
most services for £20.
Look out for offers in the
tabloid papers - it is worth
the shame of buying the
Daily Express four times
and the inconvenience of
unthinkably early sailings
(ie. 8a.m.) to save £23 on
the fare! We did.
