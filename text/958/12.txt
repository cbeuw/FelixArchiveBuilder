Nam-Pai-Chuan: Kung-Fu
I would like to start by introducing
to the readers a brief history of our
Kung-Fu System: Nam-Pai-Chuan
(NPC) has a very rich weapons and
forms heritage, eighteen traditional
weapons and over fifty different
forms are taught in the system. It
also embodies many techniques
such as self-defence, kicking,
punching, locking (Chi-Na), throws
and nerve points use.
The system was brought to
England by Sifu (instructor)
Christopher Lai from Malaysia in
1979. Since then Nam-Pai-Chuan
has grown from strength to strength
and is now well established in both
U K and Europe. The Imperial
College N P C club has been
operating for over 8 years.
Currently Sifu Lai and Sifu
Guishard are teaching in Southside
Gym regularly, on every
Wednesday (7.00pm-9.00pm),
Friday (7.30pm-9.30pm) and
Sunday (11.30am-l .30pm).
Beginners are always welcome. The
fairer sex should not feel
intimidated in turning up since over
30% of the class is female.
Having joined Nam-Pai-Chuan
three years ago, I have observed
many changes and witnessed the
progress of the system. I would like
to mention some of the worthwhile
events. I have been most impressed
by the dedication of some of the
students from other Universities.
Two students from Cardiff and
Warwick Universities travelled
regularly (over 300 miles) every
Wednesday to IC to attend our
training sessions. I very much
appreciate the time and effort that
they have invested into learning the
Art. Incidentally, both of them have
contributed a considerable amount
of effort which accounted for the
successful establishment of the
Cardiff and Warwick NPC clubs
back in 1992.
Furthermore, most of the recent
qualified instructors have also
established centres around different
Universities and Colleges.
Currently Nam-Pai-Chuan is in the
process of forming better liaisons
between different clubs. More
coordination is expected in the near
future.
Going back to the IC NPC club,
the experience learnt from the
previous years has enabled the club
to promote Nam-Pai-Chuan more
effectively on a continuous basis.
We have successfully recruited
much 'new blood' during the
Freshers' Fair and the number of
regular students has remained high
since then. This year the two
instructors have accepted the
committee's proposal to support
social events for the club; their
voluntary contributions have
enabled the committee to subsidise
various social events. A buffet,
Christmas dinner and an ice skating
trip have been organised since the
The outdoor club
start of this academic year. The
responses were extremely
promising; between thirty to sixty
people participated in each of the
events. The committee is planning
to organise more subsidised social
events in the not too distant future.
Following the successes of
previous years, the highlight of this
year's event is likely to be the
weekend training course. It will be
held in Warwick University on
17-18 April. The course is designed
for all levels of student, it involves
learning and practising martial arts
techniques that require a longer and
more focused period. Students are
introduced to different techniques
(basic and advanced) such as Chi-
gung (breathing exercises),
weapons and animal forms.
Finally, I would like to sum up
the teaching philosophy of Nam-
Pai-Chuan System by quoting a
remark by MASTER Laiâ€”T am
still learning every day.'

Most of us stayed in a climbing hut,
overshadowed by the Mountain
Tryfan. Three slept in a little cave.
Mist wafted around the slopes and
precipices of the 'Devil's Kitchen'.
We set up ropes and began to climb
the Idwal Slabs. In places, there
were no holds, roughness of jewel-
like quartz was the only support.
Oliver found a new route and led it.
At dusk, Phil, Oli, Alan, Bob,
and Dan climbed another part of the
slabs, meeting the rest of our party
at 450 feet. We abseiled down by
torchlight.
Meanwhile, the lazy slouchers,
dossers, and rugby players had a lie
in, tea in bed, cooked breakfast, and
walked up the magnificent Central
Buttress of Tryfan.
We had an enormous chicken and
mushroom chausseur thanks to
Simon 'chef Gubbins and spent the
evening in a pub in Beddgelert.
On Sunday, the keen types
dragged ourselves out of bed and
walked up the base of Tryfan in
drizzle and gloom. When we
reached the start of the climb, we
were in and above the clouds. Phil
and Oli led the way, dragging ropes
below them and securing to ledges
on the East face. That made it safe
for the inexperienced Bob and Alan
to squirm up cracks and jump for
awkward handholds.
By midday, we were into warmer
weather and the rock was drying.
The boulder strewn valley receded
below us. We had 810 feet of roped
climbing. We rached the summit
with an hour of daylight to admire
the golden clouds that blanketted the
hills below us.
