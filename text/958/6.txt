Monkey business with Ents
And now for something completely
different.
Are you bored with hearing the
same old tunes, need a break from
commercial pop, hardcore techno,
grunge, indie dance etc? Well get
down to the Union this Friday and
witness the first World Music Night
at Imperial College. This is your
chance to hear seriously good music
so leave all those inhibitions at
home, hang loose, chill out and get
up to spritual dance music with
influences from around the world
brought to you by Whirl-y-gigs
resident DJ, Monkey Pilot.
Whirl-y-gig, for those of you not
in the know, is an 'event' held every
Saturday at Shoreditch Town Hall
where DJ Monkey Pilot keeps the
crowd enthralled with his own
distinctive mix of uplifting sounds
from near and far. There are over
a thousand dedicated fans of Whirl-
y-gig who show up every Saturday
to rave the night away, check out
the long queues when it opens if
you're not convinced!
Along with the DJ we have
appearances by JOI, an Asian band,
whose music is a blend of ambient
rave with ethnic undertones. Their
first single, 'Desert Storm' was
described as the most inventive
dance record ever made and was
voted single of the week by N M E
in November last year. They are
currently signed to Rhythm King
Records and their label-mates
/
include the likes of S-Express and
Bomb the Bass.
Kicking off at 8pm this night can
be yours for just £2 and includes the
Coming up!
Next week, following the success
of Norman Jay, we'll be having
another guest DJ, Rob Blake (Third
Base, Club DaDa) he'll be playing
the best club music around and
admission is only £1 again. Get
ready for take off.
