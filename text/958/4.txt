Opinion
19 February 1993 Felix 958
Rag defence
Dear Jonty,
I feel that the Beit Back article in
Felix 957 reflects very badly on
Felix as a whole. Allowing a hurtful
personal attack on a candidate for
the ICU presidency, and indeed
everyone involved with Rag, surely
demonstrates poor personal
judgement. To make matters worse
the article was anonymous—plainly
a lack of courage on behalf of the
author. He is obviously too caught
up in his own spiteful little world
to notice, or even bother to find out
the truth. Anyone who has had any
contact with Rag would realise how
wrong his perception is.
Rag is more than just
Tiddlywinks, Monopoly, Rag
Week and being silly. Many people
involved have been part of serious
charity efforts before starting
college. Rag at IC tries (and I
believe succeeds) to make
fundraising fun by organising
collections at football stadia and
concert venues with complimentary
tickets thrown in; and doing
collections with a theme such as
pavement climbs, Cluedo and
Monopoly etc. It is a serious
Fizzling out
Dear Jonty,
It is not my intenion to play Felix
ping-pong with the resurrected Alan
Bailey. After this letter I will simply
let him fizzle out in any self-
satisfying text he may come up
with. By the way, although we
disagree on certain things, I respect
the pains he goes to to express
himself, whereas most IC students
just can't be bothered. I don't think
I would dislike the guy if I met him,
unless he's too hyped up to see how
irrelevant to the world's pain our
debate is.
First of all, I studied 20th
Century history for three years
before coming here. I'm familiar
with the subject of British influence
in the world for this period, and
know how much agitation it stirs up
organisation which raises serious
money—over £45,000 so far this
year which is one of the highest
student totals in the country. Rag
has a policy of welcoming everyone
with open arms. Over 300 people
have collected this year, all of
whom were accepted and treated as
a valuable asset. If people don't feel
welcome anywhere else, then
perhaps someone somewhere else
has got it wrong. It would be
hypocritical of us to only accept a
cultural elite. On the other hand
there is no place within Rag for
anyone being vindictive and using
us as an excuse for violent
behaviour. The 'Frontal Lobotomy-
o-gram' was in no way connected
with Rag or the RCS, it was carried
out by for non-Rag mavericks
without the knowledge of myself,
Rachel Mountford or Flemming
Heino. I would hope that the
candidates for Felix Editor in the
forthcoming elections have a policy
of printing fact rather than fiction
and will be more judicious in their
editorial decisions.
Yours sincerely,
David Woodcock, Chem 2.
More lies
Dear Jonty,
With reference to your editorial
in Felix 957 concerning 'Frontal
Lobotomy-o-grams', specifically
the line 'This delightful display of
brute force was organised by the
RCS Union'. I doubt I can get over
to you how pissed off I am that you
can happily write and print such a
lie. The 'lobotomy-o-grams' were
when discussed. I admire British
courage during World War n. I also
am sickened at the empire's
behaviour in the Third World and
America throughout history. Just
read a biography of Gandhi to
understand (very revealing about
British attitudes in South Africa and
India), or see the movie.
When the British left Palestine,
they were not capable of
maintaining peace and were
effectively thrown out by the locals
(yes, in part through terrorist
action). I believe a member of J-Soc
or Friends of Palestine could
explain this. It seems they tended
to maintain peace by using
weapons, without helping to build
peace-keeping political
structures.. .They are also
Jihad
Dear Jonty,
We recently received a letter
from Islamic Soceity (sic) scribbled
in a furious scrawl and
'challenging' us to an open debate
on Government policy on the
Middle East.
Apparently, our policy has
resulted in 'a disaster for the
indegenious population'. Although,
armed with my dictionary, I was
unable to decipher this statement,
I am led to believe that the gist of
it is that Islamic Society is not
particularly keen on it.
It so happens that we are not
particularly keen on some Middle
East nations' policies towards the
West. I won't even mention the
wanton destruction of countless
aircraft slaughtering many hundreds
of innocent Westerners.
Next, their letter informed us that
'under the Islamic State there was
peace and security for all citizens
regardless of creed.' Witness the
Kurds in Iraq.
I feel a few Jews may be
disconcerted by Islamic Society's
assertion that 'the current crisis in
the Middle East can only be solved
by the application of Islam to the
problems of the region.' Of course,
nothing to do with, and certainly
were not organised or condoned by
the RCS Union and you are utterly
wrong to suggest otherwise.
I shan't write any more because
I don't want to turn this into a
boring rant.
I remain your ever loyal servant.

(i.e. wrong, artificial) borders in

Lawrence of Arabia.
Alan Bailey seems to believe all
Third World conflicts are due to
local fanatics, i.e. not political,
economic and weaponry
contributions from ex-colonial
empires. His belief. He can feel
superior to those involved if he
wishes.
I didn't express the Falklands
problem clearly: why did Britain
possess them in the first place?
Anyway, thank Alan for his simple
and enlightening explanation.
Also: there is no obligation to
remain with the EC if it is that
dangerous and 'ludicrous', and if
you hate all it seeks to achieve. Why
history confirms this may, in fact,
be the only way.
I am pleased that Islamic Society
recognised in their letter that
Conservatism is a caring
philosophy. I am however unsure
whether they intend this as a
compliment or an insult.
Finally, their letter informs us
that Islam is a 'complete ideology'
and advises us 'to take this
opportunity to examine (it) as an
alternative.' Zen Buddhism is also
a complete ideology and this one
even promises eternal bliss to its
exponents. Despite a concerted
attempt by the Natural Law Party,
it is somehow hard to imagine that
a spot of yogic flying each morning
will do an awful lot to solve the
world's more pressing problems.
In conclusion, while graciously
forgiving the aggressive tone of
their letter we find it difficult to take
Islamic Society seriously, and are
not in the slightest way inclined to
accept their challenge.
Long live democracy,
Yours, hoping we don't have to
spend the rest of our lives in hiding,

block everybody else's plans if they
displease you?
Finally: a country, a society are
built on diversity. Uniformity
would be a total nightmare. I
believe some 'bogroll newspaper
readers' reach a better, more
peaceful life than myself. I am not
focused on intellectual superiority
as the only value the way you may
be, but enjoy bringing into the light
fanaticism of people believing
themselves rationally sound—I'm
not (is that what makes me 'an
undesirable element'?).
Yours peacefully,
Crocky.
