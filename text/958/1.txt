Charter IC Dance team win

Proposals for the Higher Education
Student's Charter have been
delayed after a furious row split the
Cabinet yesterday. The Charter,
which was to have been published
in ten days time, plans to strip Local
Education Authorities (LEAs) of
grant and fee paying powers. The
Government proposals may also
force students to pay the full
running costs of clubs and societies.
The use of Government money for
political societies and the National
Union of Students would stop.
Rumours about the content of the
Charter had already been reported
in the media, but Felix and The
Guardian have been leaked the most
comprehensive details yet. The
Charter came before the Cabinet
Sub-committee on Education this
week, with the proposals leading to
a cabinet split. Supporters of the
Education Secretary's plan for the
Government to centralise the
payment of Â£2.6 billion of grants
and fees were opposed by those
ministers who feared upsetting
Conservative Party supporters in
local government. Despite what a
senior civil servant described as
'chaos', this morning's Guardian
will report that the Higher
Education Student's Charter should
be law for the academic year
starting in October 1994.
The Charter proposes the creation
of a single 'unitary' authority for
awarding grants and loans to
students, and for the payment of
fees to colleges. Currently, loans
are paid by the Glasgow-based
Student Loan Company, and fees
and grants are paid by LEAs, or
their equivalents in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. It is not specified
IC Dance Club took most of the
if the transfer of loan awarding
powers to the unitary body will lead
to the winding up of the Student
Loan Company. The Company may
continue in order to collect existing
debts, or these debts may be
transferred to the unitary body.
College student unions will
remain funded through the block
grant paid to the college, but this
money will be broken down into
two categories: 'core funding' and
'peripheral funding'. Core funding
will be used for union
administration, welfare services,
catering, and commercial services.
Peripheral funding will be used for
clubs and societies. Funding for
sports and athletic societies, we are
told, will be considered as core
funding.
It is expected that all of a union's
grant would be consumed by core
medals last Sunday, in the Southern
spending. This leaves little or
nothing for peripheral spending,
which would have to be covered by
a levy on club and society members.
It has yet to be decided if student
representation on college
committees will be funded out of
core or peripheral spending. One
money saving option being
considered is the abolition of
Dance '93 at Weston Super Mare.
sabbatical posts, and their
replacement with professional
managers and volunteer students.
Ultra vires (out of rules)
regulations, which ban unions from
political campaigning, will be
strengthened so that student unions
would only be allowed to campaign
on issues directly relevant to
students.
