Mindless Violence
Having an avid interest in films,
I have watched with interest the
upsurge in the old debate about how
cinematic sex and violence should
be portrayed. Reservoir Dogs, Man
Bites Dog and Bad Lieutenant
graphically show the darker side of
the human condition, but raise
questions about how to show it.
Those who would control what
we watch would say that horrific
acts are prevalent enough in real
life. They argue that we come to
accept violence as part of life if we
see it often enough: How can
cinematic visions of gore do
anything but encourage the already
cynical society in which we live? It
is not too hard to point to evidence
of murders and assaults, aggravated
by glamorization by Hollywood,
and in the week when a two year
old was brutally murdered in
Liverpool, justification of any
notion of savagery is impossible.
The shortsightedness of this view
is terrifying. Those who voice such
narrow-minded opinions dare not

With regards to your letter on page
5:
1) You did use brute force and you
did lay, not one, but several of your
clammy fingers on my personage,
an experience from which I have
not yet fully recovered.
2) You requested complaints, here
is one: What kind of incompetent
asshole allows such illegal O'
Grams to occur? Since R A G have
denied responsibility and your
bastion president have denied
responsibility, who is left to take the
blame? You are. This leads me to
another complaint: Do you know
how to do your job or are you
currently taking lessons from last
year's RCS Vice President? I hear
he was an equivocal halfwit and it
look honestly at the way they live
their own lives. It takes a tougher,
more disciplined mind to look
humanity in the eye and paint it in
red and tooth and claw. How can
we deal with the fact that each of
us is capable of horrific acts, if we
cannot even admit that it is
possible? None of the films I have
named paint an attractive picture of
the violence this show, but display
decay and degradation without any
of the glossy Hollywood hype.
How can we improve human
nature if we are not honest about it.
All acts of censorship reveal a
deficiency in the censor, they show
an inability to cope with life's
terror. Even though it is difficult to
watch, this brutality should not be
viewed reprehensibly, but a way to
recognize a problem which we can
then start dealing with.
Travel Issue
This issue was meant to be a
Travel Special, due to poor
advertising, a misbehaving printing
press and sabbatical elections it
hasn't been very special. Sorry, we
will be having another one next
term when y'all are seriously
thinking about where to travel over
appears that this seems to be the
trend among esteemed members of
the RCS.
3) You also requested suggestions
regarding the service. Here are two
small suggestions that could help:
(A) Stop it all together (B) Give a
warning beforehand so the victim
can prepare for his/her ordeal,
about 5 years would be adequate,
especially if it involves being hand-
cuffed to the BroadSheet editor.

She asked me not to mention the
fact that she wrote the letter...and
that I saw her chatting merrily and
in a very friendly manner to..., so
I won't and instead I'll just say
Happy Birthday for nextweek and
I hope you enjoy the party on
Saturday.

the summer. 'Til then, happy trails.
Anything goes
Unfortunately, this year's OpSoc
production will not be the cause of
Felix going missing. Sorry, but the
reviewers we sent quite liked it.
Again, I apologise, normal
coverage of Union sponsored
productions will hopefully continue
next year. Elections
There is only one candidate to
vote for in this years sabbatical
elections, and that is Whiskas the
mouse. He is standing for Felix
editor, and besides his obvious
rodent-like qualities, I feel he would
do an admirable job. My only other
advice is to vote new election for
all other posts.

words, these codes are to prevent
any one from sleeping around to get

the country this year (allegedly).

I did N O T write last week's Beit
Back, I have never written any of
the Beit Back's and I do not intend
to start writing them neither.
Although I agree with
EVERYTHING that was said, apart
from the bit about me being a sad
bastard, it was not me since I do not
possess enough cowardice to write
something and leave it unsigned.

Beit
Back
Music leads to rape, films lead to
rape, T V violence leads to rape—
crud! All that leads to rape is the
British judicial system. Yes you've
probably heard the latest story on
how a 15 year old boy has walked
away with nothing but a £500 'good
holiday' compensation fee. But it
seems that this is not the first time
that British law has failed to support
and recognise the victim of such a
terrible crime. And even if this lad
had been given the full sentence
possible it still would have meant
that he only had to spend two years
in a detention centre due to his age
and supposed good behaviour.
What's worse is that a fully grown
man still can only be given a
maximum sentence of nine years
(someone correct me if I'm wrong),
whereas the victim has to live with
the consequences for the rest of
their life. Yes, I know it's the same
old arguments arising but it always
will be until people realise that we
can't let the bastards get away with
it. There is surely only one way to
prevent a sick minded arsehole from
commiting rape again and again—
castrate him! Harsh yes, I agree it
may be slightly extreme but it's the
only way to be sure. How many
times have we read of accused
rapists being released on bail and
doing it to someone else, worse
still, a man that serves his time
being imprisoned rapes again, often
within one or two years of release'.
I mean what kind of system is it that
allows this to happen? One that
should not be seen in today's,
supposed humane society. Rape is
the worst of all crimes so surely it
should hold the worst of all
punishments.
