Goldsmiths check
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to put straight a
number of points in your
'Goldsmiths' rip-off article on page
2 of Felix 29.1.93.
Firstly, the letter was not leaked
to me by West & Co, our General
Manager discovered the
irregularities and informed me. I
duly informed my fellow
sabbaticals and only after M r
Holmes's suspension were West
and Co called in to confirm our
suspicions.
Secondly, it was again our
General Manager who discovered
that M r Holmes had used the
Students' Union credit card for a
private trip to Amsterdam, and it
was her and not Mr Holmes who
informed West and Co. Also you
did not report that M r Holmes had
been 'no confidenced' and therefore
dismissed from office on 10th

Lobotomy
Dear Jonty,
The Frontal Lobotomy-o-gram
had nothing to do with the RCS
Union. The first I or any of the
O'grams team heard of the Frontal
Lobotomy-o-gram was at the Rag
Meeting. I am disappointed you did
not check you got your facts right,
before writing your damning
editorial. The RCSU fully agrees
that the attack was inappropriate
especially as the one thing that can
be written to PJ Dodd's credit is that
at least he has the courage to put his
name on the bottom of this column
(unlike the author of Beit Back).
This year there has been a
problem with people impersonating
the Hit Squad, or delivering their
own O'grams. These actions are
particularly reprehensible as Rag
has not received any money from
the fake hit squad and only a token
donation was received for the two
lobotomies (less than five pounds).
Various methods are being
considered to avoid a recurrence of
the events, and any suggestion is
welcome.
Jonty, you were present when I
pinion
19 February 1993
entered the Felix Office with a
genuine Hand-Cuff O'gram to
deliver. I would be most surprised
if words such as Brute Force,
mugging, thugs, or assaulted would
have been used to describe what
actually happened. M y recollection
is that because PJ Dodd refused
point blank to participate, we left
without hand-cuffing him or even
laying a hand on him.
I would be lying if I said that I
am perfectly happy with the way
that all the O'grams occurred, but
we certainly did not display brute
force. I am currently producing a
set of written guidelines for the
team that delivers the O'grams so
as to improve the quality of the
service. I would like to use this
opportunity to ask anyone who has
any complaint about the service, to
contact me via the RCS or ICU
Union Offices or the Physics
pigeonholes, I promise a prompt
and discreet response.
Yours sincerely,
Flemming Heino,
RCSU Vice President.
December 1992.
I trust you will print this letter and
put the record straight.
As a footnote, the college itself
has now informed the police and
have instigated procedures to
recoup the money from M r
Holmes.
Yours faithfully,
Terry Murtagh, President
Goldsmith's College Students'
Union.
