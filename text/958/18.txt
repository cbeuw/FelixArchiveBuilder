IC Fencing Club continued its
inexorable progress towards the
U A U championship title with a win
over RHBNC last Wednesday.
The victory was harder than
expected. Before Christmas, we
comfortably won the first round
pool, which included RHBNC. This
time they put up tougher resistance,
although they may have been helped
a little by their home advantage:
they were, presumably, used to
fencing in a bar with a juke-box and
rowdy clientelle.
The foilists won comfortably,
despite one rare defeat for Robert
Plum. Epee was closer as one of
RHBNC's team was rather good.
Fortunately his colleagues weren't,
and so it all came right in the end.

The past week has seen the indoor
football tournament go from
strength to strength. As the first
round games come to a close teams
have realised that qualification for
the quarter finals is not going to be
an easy task. This was shown by the
Lebanese team on Tuesday
afternoon. In a fast, thrilling game
they came so close in beating a well
drilled Chem Soc team. After the
previous week's defeat there
attitude and team performance was
an example to all the other teams in
the tournament. However, they
drew their match against Chem Soc
and must wait to see the result of
the Pakistan-Malaysian game next
week in order to see if they can

Sabre was, as usual, a case of our
non-specialists waving their arms
around trying to convince the
opposition that they knew what they
were doing. RHBNC were using
the same tactic, but unfortunately
they just managed to get ahead.
This victory takes us to the
quarter-finals against Sussex, to be
followed, hopefully, by the semis
and finals in Bath on 20th/21st
February.

progress to the quarter finals.
The first team to qualify for the
quarter finals was the Pakistan
team. Yet again it was down to their
very nimble forward (Pete) that they
scored 12 goals against the
Malaysian team. I think it must be
the brown trousers, which he hasn't
changed for two years, that has
brought his team such luck. Other
performances of note include the
Anti-Apartheid team who overcame
a Strong looking Iranian team last
Friday. It took a long time for the
Iranian's to adjust to the rules, but
they contributed to a skillful and
well fought game. The Islamic team
also look strong, with a comfortable
win over IC—SEDS. They showed

IC went down 8-29 to Nottingham
University at Harlington on
Wednesday. The combination of
several players getting injured and
Dave Bolton's less than silky
handling skills contributed to the
size of the defeat, but the major
factor was just how appallingly bad
Dave Bolton was.
Nottingham took an early lead
through pityful tackles by, first,
Anton Fields, and then Mark Baker.
We thought we were in real
trouble when Nick Flinn and Roger
Gilchrist went off, but it says a lot
about the influence of the two
good team work and a desire to win.
On Wednesday night the Sikh and
Cypriot Societies also qualified for
the quarter-finals. The Sikh's won
a hard fought match against the
Indian Society which got very
physical. I therefore must stipulate
again that slide tackling is not
allowed and competitive but not
aggressive football is to be played.
On the whole the first two weeks of
the tournament has seen both
attractive and fair football from all
the teams competing.

players when I tell you that our
game improved beyond belief.
In the second half, with IC losing
17-0 and with 14 players, we started
well with Dave Bolton breaking his
habit of playing like a twat, to score
a try after he caught (well bugger
me!) a pass from George Habib.
A sweetly struck penalty pulled
IC back to 17-8 before Dave Bolton
dropped a try scoring kick.
Nottingham then spotted IC's
weakness (Dave Bolton) and ran
through him to score two tries to
make the final score 8-29.
