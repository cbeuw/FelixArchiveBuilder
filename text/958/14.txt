"How long do you want this book
to be?", I asked, and got told that
4 pages was over the top. I think
that 3 words is too short. Dilemma.
Anyway, Casting follows the
romantic adventures of a
fundamentally forgettable woman,
and her attempts to form a
meaningful relationship with a man,
and at the same time to break down
the barriers of credit card limits. It's
not great literature of the
Sheakspeare league, and hardly
ranks with Enid Blyton either, but
it's enjoyable enough to keep me
reading it, and I've got a
notoriously short attention span. I
read it, I like it and then I use it to
prop up my new graphic equaliser
to stop it wobbling around and
falling off the stack while I listen
to loud music and read tacky books
about Sex and Shopping in the time
which I could use for studying.

Revenge...is a w o m a n ' s
art
A short story collection from some
well-known and some new authors
(all female, surprisingly enough)
including Louisa May Alcott, Ruth
Rendell and Muriel Spark.
Ranging from a bizarre four page
story to a four chapter period
'novel', this book has something for
every taste. The title suggests that
the stories tell of revenge wreaked
by women. There are in fact one or
two where the man is retaliating.
In the introduction, Kate
Saunders writes 'When love goes
sour, the nicest people can turn
unexpectedly vicious.' This is
highlighted in most of the stories,
while in the others, the vengeance
is provoked by family or by class
conflict. The forms of the revenge
range from the violent to the very
subtle, from murder to mental
torture, from the disturbing to the
amusing. There is something
different in each one - some keep
you guessing until the very end.
With the diversity of the tales in
this book, I would highly
recommend it. And for any women
planning revenge - you could use it
as a guidebook and get some tips or
ideas!

Saint Peter's W o l f
by M i c h a e l C a d n u m
Shrink obtains antique silver fangs
and turns into werewolf, firstly at
random and at night,then at will,
ably assisted by a similar blond of
similar persuasion.
Christ, not more bloodsucking.
Yes, it's a werewolf novel and not
a very good one at that. There's
nothing especially wrong with it;
Cadnum delivers the ancient story
with some aplomb, but we've
already met it too many times
before. The attention soon wanders
from the adequate but uninvolving
plot, and we try to remember who
anticipated Cadnum's devices,
elsewhere with more style. Modern
America psychologist faced with
genuine archetype - a mythological
figure, as large as life on the couch?
Suzy Mckee Charnas did it much
better with vampires in The
Vampire Tapestry. Foxy lady
waylays rational man into
dreamworld of lycanthropy, via
dreams of running free which turn
out to be all too real? Old hat again.
It makes a possible wet afternoon
book, and the crap, repeat crap,
cover art no doubt prejudiced me,
but StPW fails on too many
accounts: there is little horror, no
joy of discovery, and the light of the
Bleeding Obvious Plot shines
through the back cover to the first
page, illuminating this slender tale
as on a microscope slide. Cadnum's
probably worth watching in the
future though.

Powder Burn by Carl Haisen &
William D. Motalbano
"Powder Burn" is not what your
average, Indy-reading, pseudo-
intellectual, Felix book reviewer
would normally be caght reading.
Given that its two authors boast of
their investigative and foreign
journalistic backgrounds, one
would have expected something
slightly more than the average,
hollow thriller that fills the shelves
at W H Smiths' Gatwick branch.
The story is set of several weeks
in Miami, when Chris Meadows
inadvertantly gets involved in the
cocain-distribution war between the
Cuban-Americans and the
Columbians. I disliked Meadows
from the start: he's a NIMBY
"Anglo" who spouts intellectual
idealisms like "art ought to be
unfettered by ideology". His initial
moral stance about justice and
human rights soon dissolves into
something more pragmatic when he
sets out to get 'El Jefe', the Cuban
boss of the drugs operation (which,
incidentally, involves having lots of
sex and cocain on the way).
Meadows success in infiltrating
the distribution mafia and
discovering the real identity of El
Jefe is remarkable, espthe tough cop
of the story, has spent years trying
to do just that. (Nelson's most
memorable quote is "Opinions are
like assholes - everybodys got one
and they all stink").
El Jefe's death (at the hands of the
Columbians, though instigated by
Meadows and Nelson) calms both
Meadows and Nelson. It's as
though the entire drugs business in
Miami has really been shut down
and not, as is most probably true,
as if just one of Medusa's heads has
been cut off. Overall, not a very
satisfying read.

Impossible V a c a t i o n
by S p a l d i n g Gray
Spalding Gray's experience while
acting in the renowned film 'The
Killing Fields' gave him the
inspiration for some of the content
and title of his first book
'Swimming to Cambodia'. A
collection of monologues it
established his entry into authorism
and led perhaps strangely to a book
about the writing of his first novel,
the above named 'Impossible
Vacation'.
His novel strays from his
previous writing experience but not
too far as many of the features of
the monologue enter in to the
narrative form. The story unfolds
through the eyes of the main
character who relates both scene
and script as if read from trie most
perfect diary. Our hero, for that is
what he essentially is, is Brewster,
a small boy beginning to learn about
life at the age of five. Based upon
Gray's own childhood and around
his family roots in Rhode Island, the
story follows the experiences of the
growing boy, his relationship to his
mentally ill mother and the effect
of her death upon the next chapter
of his life.
A seemingly uninspired and dry
lead in to the novel transpires to be
an expert facsimile of the young
lads thoughts, not the emotionless
notes of a technical movie-maker as
first expected. The writing style
grows with the maturity and age of
Spalding's alias, following the
miscomprehension of family life
due to the madness within it.
Further, after his mothers death he
is hurled into a search for an
unknown quantity. His desire to
find it though driving him around
the world in a search for a meaning
to his existence and perhaps a
surrogate mother. He encounters
the seedy and the sensual, the
accepted and the not. A huge
learning curve of a wickedly fun
roller coaster coursing through sex,
drink and drugs, kinship and
friendship.
Managed without the excess of a
trashy best seller, the story is quite
beautiful. Exploring life in a
simplistic way which brings forth
smiles and knowing grins.
