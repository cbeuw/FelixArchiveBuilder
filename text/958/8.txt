On a Bike and a Prayer
Chris Riley finally sees the Atlantic and concludes his epic quest.
My shoulders had been rubbed
raw by the time I'd reached the
lake, and so now I adopted the
method of head through the frame
- front wheel below and in front,
rear wheel above and behind my
head, seat tube resting across my
shoulders. It felt like a long march
to my crucifixion as I plodded
laboriously upwards, straining
through the tubing to see where my
feet were landing. If I stopped to
look and think I could not go on -
so I tried not to look upwards at
where I had to climb - to the ridge
3000 feet more above my ant-like
form.
As the third hour of the bike
balancing climb passed, I began to
see the futility and pointlessness of
my goals - but I refused to tell the
others. 'Why don't you just carry
a sac of rocks up' said Stephane, 'It
would be just as useful.'
My strength and stamina was
ebbing away fast as we neared our
bivouac site at just after 5.00pm. It
was a large damp overhang on the
north wall of the gorge, with some
spartan vegetation for the mule in
front. We found a dry corner to
squeeze into at one side. Bill busied
himself collecting brush for a fire
and we squatted, feeling sorry and
cold, wondering where Bill was
going to sleep in his T-shirt and
broken shoes.
Stephane got some water boiling
on his stove and we tucked into our
dehydrated meals - dunking bread
into bolognaise sauce. Bill squatted
like some sick canary perched on a
rock - watching us feast with
contempt. We gave him some bread
and cheese which he munched
discontentedly. He spoke bearly any
French and a strange Berber dialect
which made all conversation very
difficult. When ever you gave him
anything he said 'Oui' and ate it -
his single yellow tooth working
over time. When he chewed his
whole crew-cut, bony head moved
stiffly, joining in to help the tooth.
But he looked like a cartoon rodent
freshly emerged from hibernation,
with sunken eyes, nibbling on his
first meal.
We made him some tea to follow.
What goes up...
He guzzled this down and then
quickly checked the time we wanted
to start in the morning. 'Sept heurs'
- he seemed to understand and then
he was gone into the night with the
singing of scree cascading
downwards after his broken shoes.
The night was long and chilly and
lumpy on our slope in the cave.
Goats and sheep trickled past in the
dusk, setting off rock falls. Passing
shepherds sang sad echoing songs
and their wolflike wild dogs
serenaded them in this vast
bottomless echo-chamber that was
our home.
Dawn after 6.00am couldn't have
arrived soon enough. I woke
wanting to be crucified on my bike
frame rather than carry it up another
3000 feet to Toubkal's summit. It
was still bitterly cold in our shady
gorge and the black and white of
shade chilled the rocks and all that
chose to live on them. Like lizards
before dawn we were sluggish to
pack up and more sluggish to eat
our cold breakfast of bread and jam.
Bill arrived at four minutes to
seven, without a watch, totally
unaware of the time to the point of
being blase about his punctuality. I
left the others to pack and went to
retrieve my crucifix, which I
laughingly called a bicycle, from
under a rock nearby. The start of
the climb was slow again, my legs
were numbed and cramped from a
night in the lumpy ^cave and I was
not getting any satisfaction from my
toil. The wall above me seemed
higher still and so impenetrable. My
urge to climb Toubkal was failing
me - it suddenly seemed a pointless
exercise and I had no will to do any
more.
It was an hour before the others
caught me - Bill blowing past with
all the bags, mats and sleeping bags
and a childlike urge to show us all
Toubkal, his mountain like a piece
of work he had proudly finished
only moments before. The gorge
walls tightened to a spout of chilly
grey rocks shattered by a millenium
of frost and fire. Black rain clouds
brewed and squirmed across the
tops like racing juggernauts and a
harsh wind numbed already
senseless hands and cut through our
cotton trousers. We were not
prepared for such meteorological
adversity.
The path finally spluttered to
death with a scree choked pile and
Bill sitting amidst the luggage
shivering like a sick old person. I
wrapped him in my orange cycling
cape and his toothless grin popped
out through the head hole,
chattering from the cutting wind.
We dumped all the luggage and I
gladly left the bike with it. The last
day and a bit of struggling under the
bike had sapped everything I had
