Imperial College A 25
Centaurs 10
THIS T I M E , the A ' s assembled
at the unearthly hour of nine
on a very cold Saturday
morning anticipating a ten-
thirty kick-off at Harlington.
In fact, the game was delayed
because the Centaurs arrived
late, and then with only
thirteen players. No
explanation was offered to the
punctual, but frozen A ' s .
Anyway, it was a relief to
see them arriving by car and
not by horse box.
The game started well for
the A ' s with Steve B l o c k
scoring an early try in the
corner. Then the lead was
increased by a penalty from
Dick P u l l e n . Having started
so well the A ' s felt no need
to get on with the game and
their relaxed attitude was
soon punished by a try and
penalty from Centaurs.
However, the A ' s managed to
reach half time with a lead
of 10—7 following a second
D i c k P u l l e n penalty.
A change around in the
forwards meant a much more
settled pack in the second
half but shortly after the
restart a Centaur penalty
levelled the scoring and
the A ' s found themselves
struggling with the last
quarter of the game approach-
ing. A little more effort and
co-ordination brought seven
points in two minutes. A .
quick passing move down
the backs, following a
penalty five yards out, gave
C h r i s Becque the chance of
a try in the corner. That
was followed by Dick P u l l e n
monotonously k i c k i n g a
penalty. Two more tries
then followed. The pack won
the ball near the Centaur
line, John Thomas took off by
himself (he is a modest chap).
After breaking through two
tackles and diving for the
line he decided to pass, by
bouncing the ball off the
groundl C h r i s Becque gathered,
sat down, and scored! A
superb forward pass by
Steve B l o c k put C h r i s over for
h i s third try.
A hat trick of tries by
C h r i s Becque saved what
might otherwise have been a
dismal morning. In the end it
was a victory for the A ' s , but
by an unf latteringly small
margin, considering the state
of tITe opposition. There was
little co-ordination, too much
individual enterprise and too
many mistakes. But it was,
after a l l , a victory.

LADIES ROWING
HEAD'S ROLL
L A S T W E D N E S D A Y , the
L a d i e s ' Boat C l u b claimed
their first head, when the
second crew surprisingly won
the U L IVs head, beating the
1st crew by 11 s e c , over a
17 min row. Due to i l l n e s s a
substitution had to be made
in the first boat and the third
crew had to be scratched.
T h i s w a s . the first ladies
trophy to be won, and now
holds pride of place in the
Boathouse trophy cupboard. A s
usual U L organisation was
non-existent, and the crews
were kept waiting IVihours on
the river before they were
finally started, by what
turned out to be the finish
boat as we 11.
Unfortunately the second
head, at Bedford on Saturday
went to Cambridge I. IC
ladies rowed well however,
beating U L II by over a
minute, although unfortunately
coming in 20secs behind U L I
who were in a superior boat.
T h i s Saturday seee a
third head, which we hope
w i l l be won by IC. Thanks
go to C h a r l i e , the boatman
for h i s encouragement, and
to N i g e l and Gary for c o x i n g
us so welI.

Eulogy on a win
ON W E D N E S D A Y IC 1 St XI
scored their second victory
in a row, thanks mainly to
the L S E goalkeeper.
Fresh from their easy
victory over QMC IC started
hesitantly and the game was
scrappy until a piece of sheer
individual genius from Terry
Lindon raised the standard
of the game. P u l l i n g down h i s
shorts for the fullback, he
cut inside and hit an unstop-
able shot which travelled ten
feet before dribbling towards
the goalkeeper who almost
threw it into his own net.
Lindon, 1 - 0 . Before half
time Terry Grirnwades' shot,
after a cross from the right,
was deflected by a defender
through the g o a l k e e p e r ' s ,
hands; 2 - 0 .
On the restart with IC
s t i l l licking Terry's oranges
from their teeth L S E scored.
T h i s caused IC to at last
start to play football. Within
five minutes Terry Grim-
wade's shot from Terry
L i n d o n ' s cross was guided
in by Pat Frampton; 3 - 1 .
F i v e minutes later a good
move sent Pat Frampton
. c h a s i n g goalwards t o ' slot
in the fourth as ttre goalkeeper
came out. A bullet header
from Pat Frampton after a
pin-point cross from limping
Bobby Dutton completed his
hat-trick and made the score
5—1. (Truth from Mick Popper:
Good c r o s s , header, cobbed
up and the goalkeeper pushed
it into his own net). There
then followed a long period
with Ian Huntington trying
to make Dick H a s l e r let in.,
another goal, but Dick was
up to it, coming out well to
stop the L S E forwards.
Mike Popper bustled
ineffectively in - midfield,
Jun lley overlapped w e l l ,
Dave Brabbin and C h r i s
Howley looked safe at the
back and P h i l Singleton ran
well in midfield. The highlight
of the game: seeing Concorde
before the start. Another
good performance from I C .
Team:- D Hasler, J lley, D
Brabbin, I Huntington, C

wade (1), P Singleton, T
Lindon (1), P Frampton (3),

SPORTING MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Trial by error
T H E C O L L E G E racer, a
Honda C B 7 2 , was due to
have its first outing of the
new season on 6th March.
During practice however, it
developed lubrication problems.
The result was that the race
at Snelterton, Norfolk was
not entered. It was then
decided that the club should
hold a trial between our-
s e l v e s . By chance we managed
to find some suitable terrain
nearby in a wood.
The trial c o n s i s t e d of 4
sections, three of which
necessitated riding for a
short time in a muddy stream.
The s e c t i o n s were d e v i s e d
by Tim Saunders' warped
mind. The last section
entailed passing p i l e s of
randomly placed logs.
Although the c o l l e g e ' s
" t r i a l s " bike is not a trials
bike because some of its
physical dimensions and
engine characteristics are
not those of a genuine
machine, the event did
provide an introduction to
the art of trials riding.
The word art is used
very loosely. Mike May
tried to fell at least two
trees by riding into them.
