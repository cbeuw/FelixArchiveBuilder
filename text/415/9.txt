'Watch 5t Come Down' by John Osborne
At the National Theatre
J O H N O S B O R N E ' S newly performed
play opened at the Old V i c last week
and can be seen in the National Theatre's
repertoire from March 20th. The title
comes from a demolition company's
advertising motto: " W e do it: Y o u
watch it come d o w n " ; and by the end
of the e v e n i n g you feel that the
demolition experts have done a pretty
thorough job. I cannot claim to be an
Osborne expert, but I could not help
thinking that here were Jimmy and
A l i s o n Porter, twenty years later,
with the roles reversed.
Ben Prosser is an E n g l i s h Oscar-
winning film director who hopes to
escape from the unpleasantness of
town dwelling by setting up house in a
reduntant country railway station,
sumptuously furnished with the latest
from H e a l ' s . Unfortuna'ely he bargains
without the local country vandals whose
idea of a good time is to spend it with
a shotgun. Meanwhile his wife keeps
up a fairly steady stream of vituperation
which o c c a s i o n a l l y flares into the row
to end all rows. Amongst their co-mates
in exile are G l e n , the dying writer, who
completes his twelve hundred page
book as h i s ingenue admirer prepares
h i s herbal tea, and Raymond, the
camp escapee from L e i c e s t e r and the
rag trade, who tries to keep the peace
with lavish helpings from the w e l l -
stocked drinks trolley.
The central feeling that the play
gives is one of hope in the strength
of personal relationships despite the
turmoils of the public world. Whilst
Ben and Sally (admirably played by
Frank F i n l a y and J i l l Bennett) row
their way throjgh the evening, mi.re
positive relationships are being worked
out between all the e x i l e s , the prime
mover in these multifarious a c t i v i t i e s
being J o , in a glorious performance
by Susan F l e e t w o o d , who loves every-
body.
The setting is by Hayden Griffin,
who has shown a remarkable attention
to detail. The disused railway station
s t i l l houses some of the r e l i c s of its
former glory; the platform ticket machine,
the booking office hatch; whilst the
modern additions provide what m j s t
be a property master's nightmare, in
terms of sheer numbers.
Thomas Stevenson
Old Flames By E A Whitehead
E D W A R D T R E A T S women very badly,
but it does not bother him. A s soon as
a situation becomes too difficult to
handle, he walks away from it, leaving
others to pick up the p i e c e s . Thus, at the
beginning of the play, having been
invited by his girlfriend to an intimate
supper on her houseboat, he makes no
mention of the two w i v e s he h a s deserted,
or the cruel way he has treated his
parents. These episodes in his life
are irrelevant to the b u s i n e s s in hand.
However, when his ex-wives and mother
turn up on the boat for supper, he
finds himself floundering, unable to
reconcile his relationships with these
three. A n d then they eat him.
Feasting upon cheesecake in the
theatre's coffee bar, I wondered how
r e a l i s t i c the character of Edward was
meant to be. Someone who so totally
ignored the feelings of women would be
hard to find. But, as the conversation in
the second act moved on to men in
general it became clear that the women
m i x
considered all males to be just a s
odious as Edward, who was clearly
meant to be a personification of the
definitive male chauvinist stereotype.
But the female characterizations were
scarcely more sympathetic. They seemed
to regard sex as a mere e x e r c i s e in
which each side is out for what they
can get.
I do not think I have ever seen a
production which love is so totally
absent, when the subject matter is
continually crying out for a touch of
humanity which never comes. So what
do we have left? A lot of fruity language
certainly, and moments of genuine
humour, some of which stirred the
ladies in the audience to bursts of
sympathetic applause while leaving
the gentlemen bewildered. A l l of this
adds up to give a very entertaining
play laced with bitter c y n i c i s m and a
touch of c a n n i b a l i s m . Something for
everyone.

I D O M E N E O
English National Opera
Coliseum
In rep until March 26th
I D O M E N E O , first performed in Munich
in 1781 was Mozart's first major opera
and while unquestionably a masterpiece
has been relatively neglected, it has
l e s s immediate theatrical appeal than
the later operas, being partly rooted in
the older opera seria tradition. The
first half of the work is largely a
s u c c e s s i o n of solo recitatives and
arias, in effect sung declamations
which give a severe formal and static
impression; a sort of dramatic costume
oratorio. The question arises as to
whether the theatrical trappings really
9_
enhance the musical experience.
In the E n g l i s h National Opera
Company's production, three of the
four principals are dramatically con-
v i n c i n g , the chorus hams valiantly, but
the costumes and sets are if anything
rather distracting. In Homeric Crete,
bulls' horns and dolphin motifs are
indeed to be expected but the down-at-
heel followers of Lorenzo di Medici
and soldiers who have apparently
deserted from the army of Ghenghis
Khan are puzzling elements. Elektra
seems to be moonlighting from a Wag-
nerian production (an illusion to which
the person of R i t a Hunter lends powerful
support) and the also-rans and other
ranks are kitted out in ultra-drab a l l -
purpose medaeval peasant garb so that
it comes as no surprise that they are
soon ravaged by plague and, towards the
end of A c t Two by a fearsome monster
from the region of the Dress C i r c l e .
T h i s creature is acting on behalf of
Neptune who finally appears in person
(in the form of the largest and ugliest
statue in the ancient world) to prevent
King Idomeneo from s a c r i f i c i n g h i s son
Idamante and thus facilitating a happy
ending, very much against the run of
events.
The slightly ludicrous elements of
this production are however, made to
seem trivial by the splendour of the
music; the score is sublime (inviting
comparison with no other Mozart opera
but rather with Fidelio) and the perform-
ance under Charles M a c k e r a s s went
a long way towards doing it justice.
R i t a Hunter sung superbly while John
Mitchinson (Idomeneo) and L o i s
Macdonall (Ilia) were impressive. One
wondered however, whether a concert
performance with substantially the
same cast might not have been an
equally satisfying experience.

Proust by Roger Shattuck (Fontana).
Ma^ce! Proust spent half his l i ' e
writing a book which, when finished,
was long enough to make 'War and
P e a c e ' look like an ambitious paragraph.
A s it is based on the experiences of
the first half of his life, it is unavoidably
quasi-autobiographical,and Prof. Shattuck
has in fact written this book more about
'In Search of Lost Time' than the life
of its author, these two things being
more or less inseparable. When tackling
a work of this length (about 3000 pages)
its handy to have some idea of what is
going on before you start, or you could
all too e a s i l y become rather lost in the
multitude of ideas and concepts which
run through the book. T h i s newexplanation
gives a c o n c i s e a n a l y s i s of P r o u s t ' s
oeuvre and, if you are going to attempt
the great marathon, is an essential
limbering â€” up e x e r c i s e .
T h e Poor Mouth, by Fann O ' B r i e n .
(Picador)
IF Y O U E V E R get invited to a literary
luncheon party, darling, a safe name to
spout over your gin and tonic is F l a n n
O ' B r i e n (real name Brian Nolan). A s
he wrote largely in G a e l i c his work has
been rather i n a c c e s s i b l e until recently,
but now you can sample him in P i c a d o r ,
and anyone who's anyone thinks h e ' s
great. None of this is much use to
Mr O ' B r i e n because he died ten years
ago, but you can't have the cake and
the ha'penny can you?
T h i s book is a collection of stories
about a young man in Ireland; p i g s ,
potatoes and poverty all play a large
part. It's rated as funny, which it i s ,
in a dry, surreal way; and he doesn't
mention G u i n n e s s once.
The Forest People. (Picador)
by Colin Turnbull
T H E F O R E S T P E O P L E are a tribe
of pygmies who inhabit a dense, almost
unexplored forest in the depths of the
Congo; not the most hospitable place
in the world, no Wimpy bars or other
signs of modern c i v i l i s a t i o n . The
people who live here, the Bambuti, are
even less c i v i l i s e d than the inhabitants
of IC. C o l i n Turnbull, an anthropologist,
went to live with and study these
unique folk, and managed to get accepted
by them, no mean feat in itself.
At the end of his stay there he wrote
this fascinating book about a race
whose lifestyle is as different from
ours as little green men. And yet the
question asked by the book is at first
sight almost ridiculous; are these
people really any different from us
fundamentally? It appears that the way
in which man thinks and, indeed, runs
his life, is e s s e n t i a l l y the same through-
out the broad spectrum of present day
' c i v i l i s a t i o n s ' , and arguably, throughout
history; only the external trappings
differ.
Another point, possibly a disturbing
one, is that despite (because of?)
their simplicity, people such as these
are more at peace than us. Some might
argue that a s a race they are more
mature; but you can form your own
opinions on that after reading this
thought - provoking, well written book.
More than just presenting a c a s e -
history of some obscure society with no
apparent relevance to our world, it acts
as a valuable tool in understanding the
working of c i v i l i s a t i o n s with which it
appears to have nothing in common.
