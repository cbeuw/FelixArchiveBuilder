NUS hits
outon fees
refund
T H E NUS (National Union of
Students) today demanded
the refund of tuition fees
paid by students on teacher's
training courses. This follows
the decision by Birmingham
Polytechnic to return fees
paid by second and third
year students. Last December
the students received letters
demanding payment of tuition
fees within ten days. This
followed the re-classification
of the grant status of trainee
teachers in 1975.
P r e v i o u s l y , tuition w a s
free for trainee teachers
provided the student fulfilled
the conditions for receiving
a grant. After September
1975, students in colleges
of education had the same
entitlement to a grant a s those
in U n i v e r s i t i e s and P o l y -
technics. O n e side effect of
this change is that student
teachers i n residence at
c o l l e g e s o f education are
expected to pay tuition fees
if their parents earn in
e x c e s s of £4000.
Dearing for C&G
Morrell for RCS
Upon learning this,
Birmingham P o l y t e c h n i c
Students' Union occupied
their college last December
and also sent a s o l i c i t o r ' s
letter to the P o l y t e c h n i c
authorities s a y i n g that they
believed a breach of contract
had taken p l a c e , by levying
fees half-way through a
course,, T h e P o l y t e c h n i c
agreed, and h a s refunded
fees to second and third
year students. What angers
the N U S i s that only those
students who protested w i l l
get any money back.
C h a r l e s C l a r k e , N U S
president said today "It i s
yet another example which
we w i l l u s e to persuade the
Government to accede to our
c a s e for giving full c a s h
grants to a l l students "
He added, "It i s quite
indefensible for the poly-
technic. authori ties to refund
tuition fees to some students
and not to others. T o refund
only those students who
protested against the charge
in the first p l a c e and
exclude those w h o paid
w i l l i n g l y , but with difficulty,
is a travesty of j u s t i c e .
