A L E X A N D E R W A L K E R , in h i s book
on Stanley Kubrick and h i s films,
attributes this director's undoubted s k i l l
to a unique conceptual ability which
makes each of h i s films a new concept
In cinema. 'Barry L y n d o n ' has made
use of some innovatory techniques,
notably in photographing scenes lit
by candle-light alone, but I have failed
to s e e any new concept emerging from
this film. It i s very beautiful, indeed
it h a s been described a s being like a
moving Gainsborough picture, and I
agree. Running through this i s a
deliberately simple story. Ironically
the film i s so perfect that it appears
almost mechanical, but there again all
the characters are rather nasty stereo-
types. T h i s may seem rather retrospective
as 'Barry L y n d o n ' has been out for some
time; another film that h a s been 'out'
for some time (1954 in fact) but is only
now being shown in this country, is
the J a p a n e s e c l a s s i c " S a n s h o D a y u "
(Sansho the Bailiff) by Kenji M i z o g u c h i .
L i k e K u b r i c k ' s film it i s very
beautiful and t e l l s a simple story, set
in the barbaric, feudal times of 11th
century (Heian Period) J a p a n . T h e
Mechanical, haunting, convincing
legend is an heroic tale of a brother
and sister kidnapped whilst travelling
with their mother, and sold into slavery
under the savage tyrant, Sansho. After
ten years in captivity, the brother, now
adult, e s c a p e s and goes in search of h i s
mother. Although heroic, it is a l s o , as
the film's introduction t e l l s u s , a
pathetic tale — whatever they do,
whatever principles they try to uphold,
they eventually and sadly, become
victims of the period they live i n .
Mizoguchi's atmospheric use of landscape
is, to use a c l i c h e , haunting. Throughout
the film he u s e s the subtle tones of
grey (for it is in 'black and white')
in the benign and tranquil scenery, as
contrasting backdrop to the malignant
and bestial behaviour of man. T h e
scene I most remember is where the
children are separated from their mother;
they are tricked into getting into
different boats floating on a mirror-
calm s e a a n d , to the sound of each
others screams, disappear in opposite
directions into the m i s t s . 'Sansho
Dayu' is showing at T h e Gate, Notting
H i l l - £1.30 or 80p before 3pm. (You
get a short too - an artistic experiment

The E l e c t r i c Cinema C l u b usually
shows films for two or three days only,
but on March 7th it began a season
featuring a film that had its British
premiere at the 1975 London F i l m
F e s t i v a l ; 'Story of S i n ' by the P o l i s h
director, Walerian Borowczyk. T h i s i s
the first film by this director that I
have seen - I hope i t ' s not the last.
He had one other film at this y e a r ' s
festival — ' T h e B e a s t ' - and one at
last y e a r ' s 'Immoral T a l e s ' . A s you
might have surmised from these titles
the theme is s e x , and how it controls
people. Briefly (and unshamedly
plagiaristically) 'Story of S i n ' is the
story of a fallen virgin, a victim of
evil people and a dirty world filled
with ineffective social workers, dukes,
cheats and pimps. A world where any
step from the accepted moral values
can never be retraced and each step
leads further into the murky depths.
I w a s not entirely c o n v i n c e d that the
girl is the trapped innocent she appears
to be, but the stages from virgin to
whore are s o well Dlended, that they
make the whole very c o n v i n c i n g .
M u s i c
Deodato - First Cuckoo (MCA)
Good music
A N O T H E R D E O D A T O A L B U M -
released about a month ago — a n d , as
u s u a l , i t ' s a good cut above the rest
of the debris getting released. A
few unnecessary tracks, a few goodies,
and one superlative number. Of course
it receives a s much publicity and
attention as h i s previous four albums —
negligible.
The unnecessary tracks are the
ripped-off " B l a c k D o g " , transferred
practically note-for-note from you-know-
where and supposedly written by Gene
Page, Robert Plant, and John J o n e s
( T c h , T c h l ) , and the title track by one
Frederick D e l i u s , again s t i c k i n g very
c l o s e l y to the original and sounding
out of place on the L P .
The goodies i n c l u d e " F u n k
Y o u r s e l f " , " C r a b w a l k " , and "Watusi
Strut" (Deodato Compositions) and
Ogden N a s h / K u r t W e i l l i s " S p e a k l o w "
all well up to h i s high standards in
gently-jazzed sophistication whatever
the songs' original backgrounds.
T h i s is easy listening of the highest
quality. L i k e a long smooth drink, you
know i t ' s there a l l the time but without
unpleasant jagged edges or after-tastes.
Then there is the one truly superb
song. T h i s is Marcos V a l l e i s " A d a m ' s
H o t e l " and it immediately stands
o»t a s something s p e c i a l . One of the
softest, most delicate songs, beautifully
flowing and fragile, words don't do it
j u s t i c e . T h e uncluttered electric
piano s o l o is a pure delight. Y o u
could play this song on almost any
instrument and it would sound great.
So, another one passes on i t ' s
way, barely noticed but leaving the
pleasure of " A d a m ' s H o t e l " . Some
people make music, some become
famous. T h e lucky few achieve both.
Eumir Deodato just makes good m u s i c .
Leon Red bone — On T h e Tracks
(Warner Bros.)
The ultimate
long shot
W H A T IS THIS?? Y o u may well a s k . A n d
I d i d . Answer: It's just a standard
twelve inch record, round, although the
hole doesn't seerff quite drilled in the
middle, black (no reference whatsoever
to i t ' s ancestors), and fashioned in the
modern style (ie warped and razor-thin).
Oh, and i t ' s p o s i t i v e l y horrible.
Leon Redbone comes on like an
elderly Southern states yodeller intent
on becoming irrefutable proof, of life
after death, but h e ' d settle for the
posthumous " G r o u c h o Marx sings Ring
C r o s b y " award for 1837 (a good year for
stiffs). Looking like a cross pollinated
hybrid of Frank Z a p p a and General
Custer sporting an oh so nouveau c h i c
railwayman's c a p and wall to wall
cigar smoke he croons and warbles h i s
way through the most splendiferous
selection of your favourites and mine,
v i s a v i s , " A i n ' t M i s b e h a v i n ' " , " L a z y -
b o n e s " , ad nauseam. H e sounds bored,
a hardly surprising state of the nation.
On the s l e e v e is an acknowledgement
credit to J e l l y Roll Morton and Jimmy
Rodgers " f o r their music' , who presumably
could do better than this. If you want
to hear some serious b l u e s / g o s p e l
sounds, then Taj Mahal, on say " A
step further", would be amply more
rewarding than the aural wonderment
here d i s p l a y e d .
To think that Warners have put money
behind such a project is pretty mind-
boggling and a s far a s albums go,
this is the ultimate long shot. Of course,
the whole dilemma would be explained
if it were Jonathan King in d i s g u i s e .
But then some unfortunates would
probably listen to it.

Solzhenitsyn. Matryona's House
and other stories'. (Penguin)
S O L Z H E N I T S Y N is now a household
name In both the West and the E a s t
by Virtue of h i s criticism of Soviet
R u s s i a . T h i s notoriety has possibly
been to the detriment of h i s reputation
as a writer; another reason is that
his best known works, for example the
Gulag Archipelago, tend to be rather
long and, arguably, heavy going.
However, anyone who in the past may
have been reluctant to sample h i s
large-scale books can now try this
selection of short stories and prose-
poems, and realise what an amazing
writer this much-persecuted bloke i s .
He writes with a deep-rooted affection
for the country he has been expelled
from, and seems to understand the
people more than any other writer on
either side of the Iron Curtain. Each of
these stories and reflections is a
separate chunk out of h i s vast experience
of the R u s s i a n development; experience
which includes eight years in prison
camps. Solzhenitsyn is a writer in the
modem vein (which possibly started
with James Joyce) in that he seeks
to portray a certain section of c i v i l i s a t i o n
as completely as p o s s i b l e ; and if this
includes facets which are shocking or
unpleasant in any w a y , then they have
to be included along with the good
s i d e s . A s h i s society has had a difficult
development there is more of the bad
and the ugly in these pages than the
good; but do not let this deter y o u .
T h i s is writing of distinct worth; a
huge perceptiveness coupled with an
equally huge feeling for language.
