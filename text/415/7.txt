the L o n e s o m e P i n e ' (hence the Laurel
and Hardy mentioned earlier). L i v e r p o o l ,
of course, won the event, having trained
their first team s i n c e November on the
routine, but w e came a very c l o s e
second, having seven beginners in
the squad, who had practiced for just
four d a y s . A superb effort, which resulted
in the only injury of the night when
'Hardy' dislocated a shoulder after an
over-enthusiastic shove from her
partner. (Hard-y-est luck, Sue!)
The thirty or so loyal supporters who
went down with the team deserve a
mention, and credit for egging them on
with tremendous cheers. They outshouted
the Liverpool " C o p " (sitting next to
them) and performed very well them-
s e l v e s in the 'traditional manner' of
IC students by consuming quite extra-
ordinary quantities of liquid sustenance.
But a l l credit m j s t go to the ten
members of the team who danced, as
Brian P e r c i v a l s a i d , "like I've never
seen them dance before. Truly a superb
effort by everyone."
Now they are preparing for next
y e a r ' s event, when we are the host
c o l l e g e , to be held at the P a v i l i o n ,
Hemel Hempstead. Brian hopes to get
television coverage of the event, and
a well known personality to compere the
evening. I think that a l l remains i s to
congratulate the team on this year's
magnificent performance, and wish
them every s u c c e s s in the future.
