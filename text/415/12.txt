CROSS COUNTRY
Courages Trophy
L A S T W E D N E S D A Y , t h e C r o s s -
Country C l u b struck gold
when the first team won the
a l l five r a c e s . Added to this,
strong finishing by the second
team enabled them to move
about Vets into a respectable
eighth position, so retaining
their status for another season
as a first d i v i s i o n team. The
fate of the third team was
sealed; relegation a fait
accompli, though they did
manage to raise themselves
off bottom place.
The race itself was run in
near perfect conditions, and
most runners t o o k the
opportunity to record personal
bests. Rob A l l i n s o n won his
second league race on the
trot(sic), in 26.52, winning
by over half a minute. Steve
Webb (28.22) and Ian E l l i s
(28.55) were other first
teamers recording best times.
For the second team, Ian
Isherwood (30.48) and Alan
Leakey (39.59) clocked times
which were some way beyond
their previous bests. Even
the third team, whose
physical fitness i s usually
proportional to the w e e k ' s
a l c o h o l i c consumption,
showed that they too were
not averse to stretching their
legs faster than walking pace.
Notable was Martin Tarnowski
(33.33) and Pete Johnson,
who reserves h i s better runs
for worse conditions. They
saw to it that the third team
had some moral support at the
back of the race. P S Thanks
to Squeeler Morrison and B i l l
J a c k s o n for officiating.
One could have been
excused for thinking that the
organisers had changed the
data and venue of the annual
Brighton run, if one had
witnessed the veteran cars
which conveyed us to the
final Courages League
fixture at Oxford, on Saturday.
T h i s league comprises
university and college teams
from all over the South of
England, the standard being
a couple of notches above
the London C o l l e g e s League.
The course consisted of 2
laps of 2Vi m i l e s , a long
level stretch followed by a
plunge down the side of a
h i l l s i d e and the final mile
of the lap c o n s i s t i n g of
several steep ascents in order
to get back to the top of the
damned hill and then to repeat
the same dose.
The race was won in
23.10, Rob A l l i n s o n being
first IC runner home in 6th
place — fortunately, a couple
of guest Frogs had juxtuposed
themselves between 1st and
6th, and hence did not count
in the individuals overall
positions. T h i s devious ploy
enabled Rob to gain the
trophy as the leading overall
runner in the four league
LACROSSE
No shame in defeat
Cambridge Eagles 18 v Imperial College 7
A F T E R T H E victory against
Buckhurst H i l l , Imperial
C o l l e g e t r a v e l l l e d toCambridge.
For a pleasant change we
had a full team.
The match got underway
promptly at 2.45, and within
the first minute it was
obvious who' was going to
w i n . Although Cambridge's
stick handling was not much
better than I C ' s , they fought
so hard for every ball that
it felt like playing a team of
fifteen players. At the end
of the first quarter Cambridge
led 5 - 1 .
In the second quarter the
defence tried as hard as
possible but they found it
very difficult to get the
matches. George Si veil
(Gateshead N , Q E C & IC) ran
home in 20th c l o s e l y followed
by Ian E l l i s (21) and Steve
Webb (25). T h i s c l o s e packing
enabled the first team to
finish fourth in the league,
and after much d i s c u s s i o n
as to whether we were a
c o l l e g e / u n i v e r s i t y we were
awarded lots of trophies for
being the leading college,
tho' no-one really wanted
them. The evening was spent
sampling H o o k Norton,
Morlands, Wadworths, Morrells,
and probably a few others
(but I can't remember).
Boom careers
T H E R E IS a big future for
those who l i k e making booms:
sonic booms, atomic booms,
financial booms. T h e career
racks glisten with seductive
pamphlets attracting the
final year student into
designing m i s s i l e s , nuclear
reactors and a few other
things we would arguably
be better off without l i k e
p l a s t i c food, faster cars etc.
The cheap labour rates
and repression in South A f r i c a
are still enough tor tortunes
to be made in mining and so
a few white experts will be
welcome there every year, or
in London where, lor example,
the delightful Consolidated
G o l d f i e l d s have their base,
nicely remote from the
misery they are involved i n .
Everyone no doubt has
their own personal list of
" n a s t i e s " — areas in which
they will not work for love
or money. It would be
interesting to find out how
far such l i s t s would overlap
at Imperial C o l l e g e , and
perhaps an inkling of this
could be gained through the
columns of F E L I X ? What
would be your "top t e n " of
companies or other institutions
or fields which you consider
L E A S T W O R T H W H I L E and
for a second list, what are
the ones you consider to be
l i k e l y to make the MOST
W O R T H W H I L E contribution In
solving present or future
problems facing the planet,
your continent, country, race,
etc.
So write in to F E L I X with
your l i s t s . If enough are
received to warrant it, an
interim pair of " t o p t e n s "
will be published to invite
fu/ther controversy!
CROQUET
'n a few months time the
British summer will be with
us and once again Queen's
Tower will echo to the crack
of croquet mallet against
b a l l , followed by a few well
chosen words as a player
faiIs to make a hoop.
The C l u b s playing season
starts in the summer term
with. coaching s e s s i o n s ,
informal matches . between
C l u b members and for the
more enthusiastic, team
matches against other clubs
in the London League. I
might add, one of those well
known provincial universities,
Oxford, have challenged us to
a match.
We are very fortunate in
having Professor B G Neal
for our president, for he was
open Champion in 1972 and
'73 and must be one of the
ball into attack. The attack,
when they got the b a l l , didn't
fare much better and had
lots of problems keeping
p o s s e s s i o n . So it turned into
a very defensive game on
I C ' s part. The Six M i l l i o n
Dollar man scored three
goals, but unfortunatpiv his
bionic brain then s e i z e d up.
Richard Forster and Mike
Burke did manage to save
I C ' s face, both of them
scoring a couple of good
goals.
Meanwhile back in defence
B i l l J a c k s o n and Rob
Morrison did very w e l l ,
breakinq up many of Cam-
bridge's attacks. But not
enougti. F i n a l l y in the last
quarter Pete MacDonald in
goal got back to his usual
form and made some excellent
saves.
T h i s left the final score
18—7 in Cambridge's favour.
However I think IC did very
well against a side who
could hold their own in the
d i v i s i o n above. Everybody
did as well as they could
and there's no shame in
this defeat.
Team:- P MacDonald, B
Jackson, Ft Morrison, B
Strangeway (Capt), R Forster,
M Smeaton, S Austin Mark 547,
P Jepson, M Burke, P Watson.
