PRIZE CROSSWORD No. 32
NIGHTLINE
There will be people at
Nightline during the Easter
Vacation. Many of the
volunteers are staying up to
pay rent or are wonting in the
vain hope of getting back
next year. Others however,
are di sapper aing into the
misty depths of Kent and
L E T T E R
Sir, - F i r s t of all I would
like to thank all the people
who organised the ICWA
Easter B a l l for providing a
most enjoyable event.
However, I would like to
v o c i e my disapproval of the
fact that quite a number of
people who had been to the
Chaps C l u b Dinner were
admitted to the event at about
1.00am. I realise that they
were asked to pay £1 a head
for a d m i s s i o n , but this did
not benefit the people who
had paid considerably more
for the evening and were
upset by the rowdy behaviour
of these inebriated latecomers.
I have nothing against the
people in particular, but I
believe that the principle of
only allowing people who have
attended such a function to
use its late bar and other
f a c i l i t i e s should be strickly
adhered to.
Yours sincerely,
A D R I A N S U D W O R T H ,
R C S E n t s Chairman.
North Luton.
We will be co-operating
with other Nightlines in
London so there will be
two people there each night,
but it is better to have three
and one other person (pre-
ferably the Co-ordinator) on
call.
If you can help during
Easter or are a P G who could
help with Nightline through
the exam period please give
us a ring in the early evening
this week. Arrange to have
a chat with someone already
involved. We may put on some
sensitivity training if you
are interested. You have to
be ready to listen, not to
judge, and to respect the
free will and confidence of
others.
Look forward to hearing
from you.
Anyone is welcome to
come round during the
vacation, but our location
will vary during the first
two weeks. The external
telephone number will remain
the same, so give us a ring
on 01-581 2468 before you
call round.
PS-Nightline tends to be
quiet in the vacation so if
your friends have gone away
or you are beginning to wish
you had not bothered staying
down, give the people at
Nightline a ring. They are
probably there because they
did not want to spend the
evening alone in their cold
flat.
