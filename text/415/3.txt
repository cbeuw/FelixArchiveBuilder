Inconsistency cause of poor season
T H E E N D of the U C T B A league saw
Brunei as winners and Portsmouth as
runners-up in the Southern d i v i s i o n .
After last terms defeats IC were
determined to make a greater effort in
their two remaining home games. F o r
the Portsmouth game IC were fortunate
to have John B a c o l i n i for U C to play
for the f i r s t ' s . T h i s allowed other players
to play in their true positions, in the
seconds. Both U C players showed
their c l a s s . John scoring a 607 series
and Derek M i l l s a 499. Unfortunately
they were not backed up by the IC players
and as a result the first's lost all
three games.
H a v i n g John Dereck to play in the
f i r s t ' s , r e l e a s e d players to the s e c o n d ' s
and this, combined with consistent
play from other players, meant that IC
won two games and the s e r i e s giving
them two points on the U C T B A league.
Rob Sharman displayed the style now
expected from him and finished with a
490 s e r i e s , t r u l y a firstteam performance.
The third teams performance was
less than spectacular. In fact three of
the team did not even beat the blind
score series; in other words IC would
have done better with a two man team.
A l l teams are capable of 400 series
and this kind of play has cost IC
many points this season.
The L a d i e s team were once again
under strength. The four regulars Anne,
M a n s y , - J u l i e and Briony started s l o w l y .
They lost the first game but came back
to win the second. Unfortunately they
could not muster the same hatred for the
opposition as they did against Brunei
and lost 2 games and the series. The
lack of several reliable lady bowlers
has plagued IC this season. These four
however, with their vastly different
s t y l e s have been I C ' s most s u c c e s s f u l
team this season and thanks are
extended to them for their regular
appearance.
The result of the Pompey match was
therefore 2 - 8 , which could e a s i l y
have been reversed if therp had been
Anne Holt and Alison Halstead about to roll
Mansy Laine in action
some consistent bowling. H a v i n g been
so c l o s e to beating Portsmouth it seemed
that with one last effort IC could beat
Southampton the following week.
A l l IC teams arrived in good time,
suitably kitted out in our new shirts,
on lanes, ten minutes before the
scheduled roll-off. Although the opposi-
tion had confirmed the fixture long in
advance they just did not turn up. So
IC decided to play out the game without
the opposition.
The final league position showed
IC with 13 out of a possible 60 points
and last in the southern d i v i s i o n of the
U C T B A league. Our lack of s u c c e s s s ,
could be due to many reasons but it is
blatantly obvious that the inconsistency
of some players has resulted in many
lost matches. If all I C ' s players were
simply to bowl their usual average
performances then they would have
won many more points on the league.
Another reason was that IC lack three
or four really good bowlers. To win
first team matches, five bowlers scoring
500 series are e s s e n t i a l . The top
scoring bowler in our league has an
average of around 150 and this is simply
not first team standard.
The following week saw the Brunei
doubles competition in which IC entered
four teams. Some above average play
meant that all three teams in the
handicap section finished within the
first ten. The first place had been
awarded to the captain and Peter
Hulatt but unfortunately a mistake had
been made by the organisers who
credited them with 100 pins too many.
H a v i n g pointed out this fact, the
appropriate corrects were made and
they finished s i x t h , just seven pins
above Ann Holt and Paul Bart left.
Anne playing with her usually high
standards, reached fourth position in
the ladies game and a marvelous second
In the ladies series table.
During the Annual General Meeting
the new constitution was accepted and
next years committee was ratified.
Then followed the presentation of
of achievement awards. P a u l received
a 225 chevron, C l i v e and EffnnHi
200 chevrons and
friTo^orslfofs badges.
were awarded to bowlers who, â€¢ the
captain felt had made a notable
contribution to the c l u b . They were
presented to the four regular ladies
team members, Anne for her 470 s e r i e s
and Mansy and J u l i e for their 164 and
163 games respectively. F o r h i s
consistently good work in the firsts, so
often with no reward, Dereck a l s o
received an award. P a u l won the
high game award and C l i v e the high
s e r i e s .
L a s t week in the internal league,
when the first's played the s e c o n d ' s
C l i v e , J u l i e and N i g e l became this
years league champions. The averages
table was won by P a u l Bartlett with an
average of 150 over the series.
Congratulations to all who won
awards and best w i s h e s to the c l u b
for next year.
