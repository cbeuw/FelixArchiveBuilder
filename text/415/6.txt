J U L I A
IC Second at Inter Varsities Competition
IC dancers excel
Top team in Latin-American
IT IS NOT often that you see
ten s t u d e n t s with highly
decorative dresses and suits
waiting on Exhibition Road.
Indeed, anyone passing the
Mechanical Engineering building
at 10 o'clock last Saturday morn-
ing might have been forgiven for
thinking that a Rag Collection
was about to begin - two of the
ten were dressed remarkably
like Laural and Hardy.
C l o s e r inspection and questioning
revealed that the group w a s , in fact,
this year's team from imperial C o l l e g e
Dancing C l u b , ready to take on the
best of the country's student dancers
in the tnter V a r s i t i e s Dancing A s s o c i a t i o n
Annual B a l l and Competition.

the team came second
the firm favourites and
last year's winners). In the L a t i n -
American dances, they were unsurpassed,
and individually scored two 1st's, two
2nd's, one 6th p l a c e , and the two
remaining couples both got into the
semi-finals.
The team events., where each c o l l e g e
is allowed to enter just one couple,
are the Quickstep, the J i v e , the Waltz,
and the C h a C h a C h a . Then, in addition,
there is the individual event, this
year the P a s o Doble, where three
couples may be entered by each c o l l e g e .
Our team, regularly to be seen practicing
in the J C R , included two couples new
to competition dancing, L e s Harris and
R o s E m p s o n , and John Scouthem and
Marie-Claire B e l l i z z i , whose performances
against experienced opposition were a
credit to them and I C . In the w a l t z ,
A l a n Attwood and J a n e P a t t i s o n took a
second to Manchester's couple, and
Tim Rodemark and Sue Venner positively
e x c e l l e d in the J i v e , storming home to
victory ahead of the hot favourites,
Liverpool (on account of h i s straight
Right-arm?) ( E d ' s note: that was an
in-joke.). Brian P e r c i v a l , President of
the IC Dancing C l u b , and h i s partner,
Sandra T a t e , took an equally deserved
gold in the C h a C h a C h a , again pushing
LiverpooHnto second place.
The P a s o Doble (dance Of the
Bullfighers) was chosen by the I V O A
as this y e a r ' s individual event, and we
entered the maximum of three c o u p l e s .
Here Liverpool did come out on top,
and our couples could manage only
second and sixth p l a c e s , the third
pair (John and Marie-Claire) doing
very well for their first competition by
getting a place in the semi-finals.
Then there was the 'Offbeat' —' a free
choice of movement, with or without
music, and where (quite literally) 'any-
thing g o e s ' . T h i s is usually considered
the most entertaining part of the
competition, and entries this year
included routines to ' T h e Entertainer'
(by Cambridge), ' B i g Spender' (by
Liverpool), and our very own, ' T r a i l of
"NAG"-a student campaign for a new world order
" T H E W A Y B R I T A I N trades
with other countries a l l o w s
us to live well while others
s t a r v e . "
That assertion, quoted
from their own leaflet, is
the motivation for a new
campaign entitled " N A G —
the N e w order for the world
A c t i o n Group. It is a timely
campaign because this May
in Nairobi, the 147 members
of the United Nations w i l l
be meeting to d i s c u s s all
aspects of international
trade, e s p e c i a l l y a s they
affect the development of the
non-industrialised nations.
These countries are of
course the ones with the
most intense and chronic
poverty, and with the most
fragile economies, often
based on the export of only
one or two raw materials.
Unfortunately their share
of world trade has drastically
declined in t h e -
past twenty
years, a s described in the
N A G leaflet: " I n 1950, the
Third World, with two-thirds
of the world's population,
had one-third of the world's
trade. By 1971 their share
had shrunk to l e s s than a
s i x t h . Meanwhile, the prices
the poorer countries were
paying for their imports rose
faster than the prices they got
for their exports. T a n z a n i a ,
for example, had to s e l l
5.3 tons of cotton and 17.3
tons of s i s a l (a fibre used
for making rope, mats, etc) in
1965 to buy one tractor; by
1972 that same tractor cost
her the equivalent of 8 tons
of cotton and 42 tons of s i s a l . '
That is the kind of problem
being confronted by N A G ,
along with several organisa-
tions in Britain such as
T h i r d ' World F i r s t , Christian
A i d , War on Want and the
World Development Movement,
a l l of whom are taking
political or educational action
to ensure that the B r i t i s h
Government plays a fuller
role at that conference
than it might otherwise do,
and that more and more people
in Britain become aware of
the importance of the con-
ference 'or them in the light
of the needs and the rights of
people elsewhere.
There is little doubt
that the present system of
world trade w i l l be changing
d r a s t i c a l l y , if only because
of the power and inspiration
of O P E C . T h e whole rusty
and unjust machine needs
to be dismantled and rebuilt
to serve the needs of the
poorest nations. Britain is
more likely to recommend a
new coat of paint and a touch
of o i l here and there, and
that is where N A G and the
others come i n . F o r details

should do, and what you
