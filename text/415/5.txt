IN TELEVISION?
L O N D O N W E E K E N D T E L E V I S I O N is undertaking a
widespread search for two suitable candidates to start
work in the Autumn a s trainee researchers'.
Those appointed w i l l be given the opportunity to familiarise
themselves with all aspects of t e l e v i s i o n .
After the s u c c e s s f u l completion of their training they w i l l
be assigned to research posts on particular programmes.
The s u c c e s s f u l candidates are likely to be (but are not
necessarily) in their early twenties. They will already
have proven academic ability. They will already have
demonstrated some originality in theatre, film or journalism
and they must appear to have the potential in the long
term to rise to senior creative positions in television
Applications, accompanied by a typewritten curriculum
vitae, should be sent to:
Controller — Staff Relations
L O N D O N W E E K E N D T E L E V I S I O N

in top left hand corner, and all applications must be
received by 15th April, 1976'.

Vacation money
F O R U N D E R G R A D U A T E S , and
some PG'-s, the Grant is
normally expected to cover
30 weeks a year, but contains
an element of £3.18 per
week which is a part con-
tribution to living expenses
during the vac. The proposed
changes to this element do
not come into effect until
next September and thus you
can s t i l l claim the present
amounts, which allow for the
grant element that the DHSS
assumes, often incorrectly,all
students receive. The student
rates are:-
L i v i n g at home(with parents) -
55.52
Single householder (flat/digs) -
£7.72 4 - rent.
Married/cohabiting couple -
£14.57 + rent (£13.39 if both
are students)
To claim you must
register as a v a i l a b l e at any
Dept. of Employment (DE)
office from the first day of
the V a c . (or later - but
y o u ' l l get l e s s ) . You can
register at any D E office,
but they will give you a
' B T form which must be
taken to a specified DHSS
office. T h i s form is used to
c l a i m supplementary benefit
allowance listed above.
Registering is usually only
a formality, but if they do
offer you a job (unlikely
in the present unemployment
situation) you may refuse
it (but it may affect the
level of payment). When you
go to claim take a pen for
f i l l i n g in forms, and the
following documents; form
B 1 , proof of dates of vacation,
proof of grant, rent book/
latest rent receipt/proof of
rent l e v e l , r a t e s / g a s /
electricity b i l l s if any, bank
statement, any other savings
details (savings of less than
£1000 approx are ignored).
L a c k of these may cause
delay. In all c a s e s be as
honest as p o s s i b l e as the
DHSS send out visitors to a
random sample of claimants.
If you have to pay rent or a
retainer for your f l a t / d i g s
during the vac claim this
even if you are living at
home, and appeal if you
don't get it. In all c a s e s
appeal if you are unsatisfied
with your c l a i m , and also
inform the Walfare Centre
/ U n i o n and we w i l l provide
help with the c a s e . You have
to appeal within 21 d a y s of
being told what you are
getting. A p p e a l s cost nothing
to you and may mean more
money.
If you have any problems
about s o c i a l security, or
want more information, then
drop a line to the Welfare
Officer via the ICU office, or
drop into the Welfare Centre
at lunchtime. In any case
please let us know how you
get on as we are considering
setting up a student centre
at college for signing on from
next year.
After the vac, every Wed-
nesday from 12.30 to 1.30 a
legal advice service w i l l be
provided in the Welfare
Centre. T h i s will be run by
law students from the L S E ,
and will give advice on
Social Security, consumer,
accommodation and other
legal h a s s l e s .

Debating Society
A T M I D N I G H T o n e ' s mind is
not disposed -to -producing
articles of interest and broad
wit, so I have written this
instead.
Egad Sir!... To the point;
it has been noted that there
is a lamentable deficiency, of
capable and distinguished
speakers at Imperial C o l l e g e
(especially C C U officers,
P h i n e a s , Mike and Percy
(deceased) and a number of
huge lecturers).
Thus we, being elevated
from the .grandiose heights
of normality to the infinite
paradise of i n e b r i a t e d
complacence, announce that
a society such as has never
been seen, will rise in your
midst; a .veritable Phoenix
(no relation) returning from
the ashes.
Cultural life (as wot is
'streamly lackin') may return
yet again, with the advent
of the Imperial C o l l e g e
Debating Society.
Any road, down to brass
lads (mining talk to reach
pur more deprived brethen).
We don't need your support
or help and don't mention
apathy because who cares
anyway? However, being
stones, we have decided
that to get a grant from
" M e s s r s Teague and Downs
(Registered Usurers) L t d . " ,
the Debating Society may
need members.
Another trifle is organ-
isation, a necessity arising
from the bourgeois bureaucracy
within which we'are entombed
comrades. So, if you are
inept, incredibly boring,
and despicable to the point
of nausea, then the organisation
may have an opening for you,
that is, chairperson, manholes
e t c . '
For further details send
all enquiries through internal
mail to C G Miller, M O T
(failed), U G Letter rack,
P h y s i c s Dept.
If you hurry we might even
read some.
