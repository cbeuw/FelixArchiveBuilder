Southside Snacks
The Southside Refectory has now
gone over to the new snack service at
weekends. What do you think of it? Most
people that I have talked to seem to
think that it is a great improvement,
and I have been asked whether we should
go over to that type of service during the
week as w e l l . I am not sure about this
and I wonder if a snack service every
day could become a little boring. Do
you feel that we should move over to
a snack service a l l the time?
Elections
I should like to take this opportunity
to congratulate a l l those people that
have been elected to posts in the Union
for next year. We have an almost full
complement of officers, and excepting
any that fai I their exams the U n i o n should
get off to a good start next year. I
wish a l l those that have been elected
a s u c c e s s f u l , but above a l l , happy year
of office. There are s t i l l several
elections to be held this year, so if you
want to help out and have not been
elected to a post yet there are s t i l l
plenty of opportunities. John Downs
w i l l hopefully be p u b l i c i s i n g the
elections as they come up. Get involved,
it is your U n i o n !
T h e N U S Debate
I have not previously replied to a
letter in F E L I X two weeks ago from J
Stuart, Maths I, because I have not
really had enough for a full Peter Patter.
F i r s t l y , I am disappinted that he
felt the debate was f a r c i c a l . H e may
not appreciate that I was responsible for
organising the debate and that I did
check that Mr M i n n i s w a s a v a i l a b l e a
few days before. In the intervening
period however he received a mandate
from his C o u n c i l or U G M not to attend
meetings outside Aston when there
are University Committee meetings.
H e could not come after this, and he
failed to notify me.
Secondly may I assure you that had
the vote looked c l o s e to me, or had it
appeared that the count was inaccurate
I would not have hesitated to ask for a
recount. F i n a l l y I am a little disappointed
that Mr Stuart chose to air this in
F E L I X rather than come and talk to me
Mutters
H A V I N G been snowed under with work
recently, F E L I X has been ignored by
yours truly. May I now clamber into
my c o l u m n i s t ' s hat, and offer one or
two m o r s e l s . . .
Colours
At the ICU Annual General Meeting,
to be held on Thursday 13th May (only
four college weeks away, chronopihiles),
s o c i a l and athletic colours w i l l be
awarded. If you wish to propose some-
one, please let me have your propositions,
in writing, together with your reasons
for such nominations in the near future
(ie, as soon as p o s s i b l e ) .
Elections
These have mostly happened now
(as if you did not know). My thanks to
those who stood, or voted. There is just
S O M E O N E said to me a few days ago.
" Y o u know, this is the biggest load of
troublemakers IC has sent to an N U S
conference for some t i m e " . I can see
what he meant. Pete Teague, the
biggest stirrer around and an excellent
public speaker, N i c k Brayshaw, an
individual never afraid to speak h i s
mind (loudly) - it is rumoured that he
w i l l be taking the Mines brain c e l l to
conference. Tony F i t z g e r a l d , who
caused a bit of trouble at the last
conference in the debate on N U S Travel
R i c k Parker, our A A O , who caused some
trouble for Ms Sue Slipman, N U S
national secretary, at the Postgraduate
conference and was then elected to the
N U S Postgraduate Advisory Group. I am
sure that he will have something to say
about P G grants and on his education
motion. The fifth delegate, sometimes
known as " T h e M o l e " , tells me that he
intends to dig deeply into the N U S
Constitution (again).
Our observers are N i g e l Miller,
Adrian Sudworth and Hugh Barrett,
next year's External Affairs ofticer.
They w i l l keep an eye on the N U S
E x e c u t i v e while the delegates are
manoeurvering in smoke-filled rooms to
" c o m p o s i t e " m o t i o n s , that is,
amalgamate motions with common
viewpoints.
The motions on which IC has
speaking/compositing rights are:- N U S
Constitution, Grants, H a l l F e e s , Welfare,
Education and the Bucharest Beano.
F e e l free to d i s c u s s with the delegates
any of these matters; they are all very
approachable and mine is a pint of I P A
p l e a s e .
about it. I do not feel that a c o l l e g e
wide ballot would be useful u n l e s s
accompanied by a lengthy publicity
campaign so that people could make
an informed d e c i s i o n . Anyone can of
course propose a motion to a U G M that
we hold a referendum, and we w i l l .
Hall Rents
The annual round of estimates for
the coming s e s s i o n has started, and
included in this are the residence
estimates. N o decision has yet been
taken on rent levels for next year but
if the accounts are to break even it
seems that another increase of about
2 0 - 2 5 % w i l l be n e c e s s a r y . I have
adopted the attitude that any charges
made should be consistent with the
student grant, and I intend to maintain
this p o s i t i o n . I w i l l keep you informed
on how things are going. Pete
one batch of elections to go through,
and the posts concerned are:-
F l o o r Reps: These " o f f i c e r s without
portfolio" sit on ICU C o u n c i l , and do
not have s p e c i f i c areas of responsi-
bility.
U L U Rep: H e / s h e s i t s on U L U Student
Representative C o u n c i l as I C ' s rep.
There are a l s o v a c a n c i e s for members
on the Haldane Library Committee,
P u b l i c a t i o n s Board and Accommodation
Committee.
The papers go up today in the
Union Lower Lounge. If you want a
strong Union next year, p l e a s e think
about standing.
Working Party on Union Response
The next meeting of interested
parties will be on Tuesday next at
12.35pm in Pete Teague's office. If you
are concerned over whether the Union
is responsive to your needs, come
along and v o i c e your opinions.
That's it for now. My thanks to
June and Georgia in the Health Centre
(things are happening).
Cheers, John
Regarding the N U S Constitution, I
received a visit last Friday from a
member of Exeter C o l l e g e , Oxford.
T h e object of the visit was to convey
the thanks of the Oxford C o l l e g e s for
the IC motion on Central Representation.
ICU has thoroughly d i s c u s s e d direct
elections and a number of other i s s u e s
on which we feel that N U S could be
improved, that i s , made to represent
us and fulfil its proper role. T h i s was
endorsed at the last Union meeting by
the motion that the ICU Executive should
do all in its power to get these changes
through conference. The Executive
and myself are devoting a lot of time and
effort to this campaign.
I was pleased to see a few more
people on the last N U S demo, and I
would like to point out that it w a s
condemned by a number of Conservative
Students) makes an annual submission
to the D E S on the matter, but because
the demo was also said to be a protest
against the Government's economic
P o l i c y . The fact that the N U S E x e c u t i v e
oppose the p o l i c i e s of the Labour
Party shows that the Broad Left are
not as broad as they pretend to be.
One amusing incident from the
demonstration; we were marching down
Oxford Street chanting " C h a r l e s C l a r k e
o u t " when a young lady from the group
in front turned round and asked "Who
is C h a r l e s C l a r k e ? " ! !
The N U S are currently very worried
about Scottish U n i v e r s i t i e s after the
first " B r o a d " Left " c o n t r o l l e d " (ie
infiltrated) Union, Strathdyde voted to
leave N U S , they being the third union
to disaffiliate in Scotland. N U S intend
to set up a Scottish Union, which
probably explains the occurence of
" d e v o l u t i o n " motions at a number of
recent policy conferences — grasping
at straws, perhaps?
One source of worry for both N U S
and IC Union is the problem of communi-
cating its activities to students. At the
suggestion of R i c k Parker, you should
now find photocopies of N U S Main
M a i l i n g s on Union and J C R notice
boards. P l a s e read them — in the
current issue there are a number of
juicy items, v i z , the free booklet
issued by N U S explaining why Iceland
should have a 200 mile fishing limit.
There is also the usual stuff about
expenses paid (by us) trips to Eastern
Europe by N U S hacks such as C h a r l e s
C l a r k e . There is also some data on
Overseas Students which you may find
interesting.
I should also like to point out that
meetings of all IC Union Committees
and C o u n c i l meetings are open to all
students, unless we vote to go into
c l o s e d s e s s i o n which is very rare,
s i n c e very few observers ever attend.
A l l of you are welcome to External
Affairs meetings. Unfortunately these
are usually c a l l e d at short notice so
it is rather impractical to advertise
them in F E L I X , although I shall try to
do so; therefore you should phone the
Union and ask J e n , who has the inform-
ation on all meetings at her fingertips.
The next C o u n c i l is on Monday at 6.00pm
and the next External Affairs meeting
is on March 22nd at 1.00pm.
At the end of a week of several
social functions and both pre — and
post - electoral consumption of a l c o h o l ,
the one event which stands out is the
ICWA B a l l and I would like to express
my appreciation of the work put in
by the ICWA committee to make this
such a s u c c e s s , and to E n i d Glitter
for bringing a hip flask of Southern
Comfort with which to sustain the
revellers after the bar shut; and con-
gratulations to Paul on h i s new haircut
(who said " w h a t about yours''")
