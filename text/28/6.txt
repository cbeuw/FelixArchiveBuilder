D 1 TO I.C.
Congratulations are due to the four athletic clubs
whose teams have sucessfully disposed of their opponents
in the first rounds of the U.L. Cups. Besides those
mentioned elsewhere on this page the Rugger Club beat
HiE.C. .14-0 in a hard, fast game played almost entirely
in the N.ii.C. "25". The most pleasing of these suoesses is
that of the Soocer Club, who have been suffering from
having no experienced goalkeeper. The results of the last
few matches indioate that the problem has been solved, for
the first team at least.
The second round draws at present are
1. Dec. Soccer v N.E.C.
5. Dec. Rugger v C.E.M.
Remember these dates and grace the touohline to give your
, college the encouragement and support It deserves.
Whatever the weather, the Morphy and Lowry races
promise to be close things, with the advantage to the
heavier and more robust Mines orews i f there is much wind,
provided they do not suffer the fate of the Oxford crew so
completely defeated by the w*tarman3hit> of Cambridge.
May we remind College Cteamlt >.3e& and

HOCKEY
U. L. Hockey Oup 1st Round
Imperial College 5 St. George'a Hospital 0
I.C., by a remarkable recovery i n the l a s t
f i f t e e n minutes o f toe game, have come success-
f u l l y through the f i r s t round o f the U.L. Cup,
but i t was a recovery, or perhaps I should say
an awakening, that might well have been too late
against more formidable opponents. That the
I.C. goalkeeper was scarcely troubled during
the whole game i s an indication o f the good
work done by the halves and backs, p a r t i c u l a r l y
by the halves, and the r e a l weakness f o r the
f i r s t three quarters o f the game, during which
no goals were scored, lay with the forward play.
I should have l i k e d to have seen fewer i n d i v i -
dual spurts and less scooping o f the h a l l , and
more hard h i t t i n g and swinging o f the h a l l
across the f i e l d , so that one could have seen
the forward l i n e more down the f i e l d as a l i n e ,
and as a fast l i n e too, f o r the p i t c h was not
i n a very bad state.
In the l a s t quarter o f the match there
were some good passing movements and some very
good hard h i t t i n g , and shooting i n the c i r c l e
combined with&oue fast following up, i n marked
oontrast to the f i r s t ' h a l f , when i t was p i t i f u l
to see the b a l l bouncing o f f the opposing goal-
keeper's pads and the I.C. forwards waiting on
the c i r c l e f o r the goal keeper to pass the b a l l
to them. I t i s not always necessary to break
the goal-keeper's s t i c k , but t h i s occurrence
did at least indicate that someone was tackling
him hard'.
I.C. have a long-standing and high reputa-
tion to maintain i n University hockey and i t i s
going to be d i f f i c u l t , but the closing stages
of t h i s match showd that they can do i t , and we
wish them the very best o f luck i n future games,
both cup matches and otherwise.

UNIVERSITY OF LOUDON ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL CUP
I. C. 6 West Ham 2
I.C. won t h e i r f i r s t round cup match com-
f o r t a b l y , but the game was not ao one-sided as
the score suggests.
The game started at a fast pace with I.C.
playing the b e t t e r f o o t b a l l . I.C. went ahead
a f t e r f i v e minutes' play, Modge f i n i s h i n g o f f a
good passing movement by the forwards, and con-
tinued to press the West Ham defence, but, f o l -
lowing a break away, West Ham equalised with a
fast ground shot. I.C. quickly took the lead
again with a goal by Clenshaw and then attacked
continuously without being r e a l l y dangerous.
West Ham equalised with a high lob and I.C.
then had. the misfortune to Itfse t h e i r goalkeeper,
who, suffering from an e a r l i e r i n j u r y , had to
go on the l e f t wing. The speed of the game
slackened and play was mostly i n mid f i e l d , no
further goals being scored by h a l f time.
Clenshaw scored I.C.'s t h i r d goal immedi-
ately after the K.O., and soon a f t e r obtained
his hat-trick with a shot that gave the goal-
keeper no chance. 1 . 0 . then had complete con-
t r o l o f the game and played very good f o o t b a l l .
Clenshaw scored two more goals, making his
t o t a l -
f i v e .
On t h i s form I.C,, should dp very well i n
the cup t h i s season, a l l eleven players
'having a very good game." "But s p e c i a l mention
jnust be made o f Clenshaw and Ward who, deputi-
sing i n goal, made two grand saves.
I.C. meet N.fi,C. on 1st December i n the
second round o f the cup.
SQUASH
The form and fortune o f t h e squash teams
so f a r t h i s season has been 'changeable. The
f i r s t jtjeam started the season w e l l with a 5 - 0
d e f e a t o f King's, but followed t h i s with a narrow
defeat 2 - 3 by Lensbury and a crushing 0 - 5
defeat by a very strong Wimbledon team. They
then v i s i t e d St. Catharine's College, Cambridge,
where none o f the team seemed to f i n d t h e i r
form on the unaccustomed and very fast courts,
and were inexcusably beaten 2 - 3 . I n t h e i r
next match, however, they beat Ashtead away i n
an extremely close match, 3 - 2 .
The second team t h i s year have proved keen
and promising, and the competition to get into
i t i s considerable. They have so f a r won
against College of Estete Management 1st and
I b i s 2nd, and lost to Lensbury 2nd.
The newly re-formed University club are
t h i s year running a 3 - a - s i d s knock out tourna-
ment, and i n t h i s our team got through the f i r s t
round, against Wye C o l l e g e , on t h e afternoon
a f t e r t h e Wimbledon match. U. D. Martin a t
No. 1 won h i s t i e 10 - 8 , 9 - 6 , 9 - 7, but
A. R. Warner, p l a y i n g at No. 2 with a septic
t o e , l o s t 9 - ? , 3 - 9, 10 - 8 , 7 - 9 , 7 - 9.
However, &. M. Hughes, whose f o r m t h i s year has
been v a r i a b l e and who was ' a t r o c i o u s l y unfit
a f t e r a m i l d a t t a c k o f ' f l u . , , surprised the
g a l l e r y and h i m s e l f by w i n n i n g 8 - 1 0 , 9 - 5 *
9 - 7, 10 - 9. Our chances of winning t h i s
tournament are d i f f i c u l t to a s s e s s because the
draw Includes several hospital teams whose
strength i s n o t known. However, i f we survive
t h e next round against Westminster H o s p i t a l ,
we arf hoping t h a t t h e team w i l l be strengthened
a f t e r Christmas by t h e return o f J e f f Kenyon,
and i f he can quickly get back into practice
we should stand a reasonable chance.
