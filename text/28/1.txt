MORPHY DAY -
P R O S P E C T S FOR WEDNESDAY
On Wednesday, 28th. November, the annual boat
raoer f o r the Morphy and Lowry Oups w i l l be rowed
off. The former over the 1 mile 5 furlong course
from Hammersmith Bridge to the U.B.R. Stone
Putney, whilst the l a t t e r i s raoed over a shorter
distance, the start being at the Mile Post.
With the raoe s t i l l two weeks ahead, what may
happen i n the way of ohanges of form 1B a matter
of conjecture. Nevertheless, whereas a wiser man
would keep h i s pen i n h i s pocket, your rowing
correspondent w i l l t r y to set out the ohanoes of
the three Oollege Boat Olubs and w i l l be rash
enough to attempt to predict a r e s u l t .

The R.S.M., holders of the Morphy Oup, are
doing t h e i r utmost to ensure the r e t e n t i o n of t h i s
trophy. With only three old colours i n the boat,
they are, i n more senses than one, not the orew
they were last year. A strong and p o t e n t i a l l y
powerful crew, they laok the spring and punch on
the beginning which, with precision i n timing made
them suoh formldible opponents i n 1950. P.D.R.
Maltby, t h e i r Captain,will no doubt go f a r i n
r e c t i f y i n g these points i n the days that remain
and should conditions be rough and the wind from
the S.E. they w i l l be well to the f o r e .
The R.O.S. under the leadership of R.D.Hughes,
are the l i g h t e s t of the orews. As such a t a i l
wind would suit them, allowing t h e i r neatness
and watermanship to 'be shown o f f to best advant-
age. The lnfluenoe of the s t y l e of the recent
Lady Margaret orews i s very evident and It w i l l
be i n t e r e s t i n g to see how f a r these ideas can be
i n s t i l l e d into a l i g h t orew i n a heavy clinker
boat. I t Is a s t y l i s h orew and with a l i t t l e
more consolidation of the f i n i s h w i l l be d i f f i c -
u l t to beat i n good conditions.
The 0.& G„ are somewhat of an enigma. There
are three eights In t r a i n i n g and the ohoioe of
which two s h a l l race has s t i l l to be made. What-
ever the ultimate deoislon, any one of these
eights i s capable of winning the Lowry Oup,—-
the Morphy, however, i s another matter and some
Improvement i s necessary f o r them to win that.
Guilds should win the Lowry Oup. The other
two Colleges have dead-heated f o r seoond place
for the l a s t two years, and i t w i l l be i n t e r e s t -
ing to see whether the R.C.S."David" with an
average weight of less than 10st. can overoome
the R.S.M."Goliath", who average l£st. heavier.
As i n previous years, the Umpiro w i l l be J.H.
Page (T.R.C.), with O.A.Bristow as Timekeeper
and G.O.Lowry and R.D.Hoyle as Judges.

T H E B R I G H T O N R U N
About 8.20 a.m. on Sunday morning Bo l e f t Guilds,
in pouring r a i n , for Hyde Park.
At 9.03 a.m. we l e f t the s t a r t i n g point on our
t h e o r e t i c a l l y three hour Journey to Brighton. It was
s t i l l r a i n i n g .
On the Journey, the crew, J.R.Howarth, K.J.Neale,
M.J.Day, D.Thomas and D.J.Gardner were steadily
getting wetter. Worst of a l l , i t looked as i f the
adverse conditions were going to make the journey
longer than anticipated.
Our fears about the length of the journey were
j u s t i f i e d and a f t e r one stop f o r p e t r o l and two f o r
coffee we were well behind schedule. This did not
matter, as to qualify one has to a r r i v e before 4. p.m.
In spite of the wetness, the crew remained happy
and considerable enjoyment was had from our private
"dice" with W.A.L.Cook's 1903 A r g y l l which we passed
several times.
We arrived i n Brighton about 2 p.m. a f t e r a Jour-
ney of some two hours during which i t never stopped
r a i n i n g . Luckily Bo had given very l i t t l e t r o u b l e .
The journey home was uneventful but we did not
arrive u n t i l 1.30 a.m. P.A.S.Blomfield and I.W.Joffe
drove some distance. It had stopped r a i n i n g .
LORD MAYOR'S DAY
Having obtained permission by telephone to
take up s t a t i o n along the Lord Mayor's route.
Boanerges set out from I.C. a t 10.4-5 a.m., with
the President and Corporation of Guilds on board.
They made the f a s t e s t time to Aldvych that can be
remembered f o r any method available, and entering
the path of the procession c i r c u i t e d Ludgate
before parking i n St. Paul's F i e l d s . (The bombed
s i t e ) .
On the a r r i v a l of h i s worship S i r L e s l i e
Boyce, Lord Mayor e l e c t , h i s Highship the P r e s i -
dent of Guilds, Gentleman Jack Howarth, raised
three cheers from the Guildsmen and other I.C.
men (and woman) assembled. Then an excellent
Boomalakka was given and Bo' seen o f f home, waived
on by the dust-carts awaiting t h e i r turn.
The President's party a r r i v e d back by 1.0p.m..
an i n d i c a t i o n of a sound performance by the 1901
worthy. The men of I.C. then followed separate
ways, some remaining with the procession to
Trafalgar Square - an i n d i c a t i o n of t h e i r sound
behaviour. ________
