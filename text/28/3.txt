THE CULTURE VULTURE
v u r f r e s h e r s h o u l d , by now, be t h o r o u g h l y per-
0 p l e x e d . At the b e g i n n i n g of term he was
s t r o n g l y urged by h i s Dean and P r e s i d e n t to tske'sn
active part i n the Union: and probably within
the l a s t few weeks he has found out (even without
FHOENLX REVIEW to help him) what i s going on.
&ut soon one term w i l l be over, and the dove-
t a i l i n g of attractions, commitments and academic
work w i l l begin. Our "Coming Events" column this
year has been redesigned to select the widest
range of items of general i n t e r e s t - apart from
the Sports side, which i s covered separately.
This l i s t has apparently not been enough to
a t t r a c t the mass of students to try at least one
of these features so easy to hand. Witness the
attendance at the "Mock" E l e c t i o n .
We would l i k e to draw attention here to the
range of l o c a l f a c i l i t i e s . Our student may have
v i s i t e d one of the Museums i n E x h i b i t i o n Road, but
how many of us know the "Geological", "Science"
and "Natural History", and have taken our g i r l to
the " V i c t o r i a and Albert"? We are well-served
for music. We have our Musical and Jazz
Societies, orchestra and choir. The Albert H a l l
i s on our back door-step, and the Royal College of
Music over the road. Admission i s free to the
R.C.M. concerts held every Wednesday at 5.30 p.m.
I f you prefer a contrast i n hops and dances, there
are the Friday evening hops at the Royal College
of Art Common Room, i n Cromwell Road. , The use of
t h i s Union i s open to a l l I . e . , and i t may
Interest you to eat there one day next week.

The term "brown-bagger" was, we a r e t o l d ,
