off..
Meanwhile, about 100 members of I.C., in conjunct-
ion with Northampton Engineering College, had attempted
to enter U.C. by a devious route, and to set the bon-
fire alight, but U.C., with memories of last year, had
left a strong fire-fighting force behind, and despite
strenOus efforts, the bonfire was substantially intact
when the procession returned. Soon the night was made
hideous by many college war-cries, and fireworks of a l l
descriptions. Point was given to the plea in the last
FELIX for an I.C. cry, by the fact that there were
several bands of I.C. men roaming the U.C. "Quad", but
they had no means of rallying together. However, I did
ho«r a "Guilds" Boomalafeka at one stage of tho proceed-
ings.
