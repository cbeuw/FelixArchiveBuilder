L E T T E R S TO T H E EDITOR
S i r ,
I was prodded by C.h.H. to write something
for FELIX the other day. If you don't l i k e the
enclosed i t ' s his fault for asking.
A . F . J .
, "Won't you write something for FELIX?" he asked.
Just because,
Years ago when FELIX was only a k i t t e n ,
And didn't know any better,
They printed" a poem of mine.
I ' l l write him a l e t t e r .
"Comments are invited on this subject"
- That's the thing.
"Deer S i r , I "
. . . . wonder how many irate indignant authors,
Glowing with white hot thought.
Find i t s o l i d i f i e d after three words?
I ' l l write about sport.
"The X club has made a good start to the y e a r . . .
We started with b freshers - now we have a + b
(Where a is j u s t > - b ) .
We've won a l l our matches - but two
(We've only had three).
"Won't you write something for FELIX?" he asked.
I've written.
But since they've not printed such d r i v e l for months
Is a l l this i n vain?
One thing i s certain, that i f he reads this
He won't ask me again.
Hi LOIi*.JN_^â€¢ ...here t o eat
S i r ,
I was seriously dismayed to read i n FELIX of
Nov. 9th that an a r t i c l e on "Where to eat around
I.C." was contemplated. Although only a fresher
(min) I had been quite successfully a l t e r i n g my
outlook r a d i c a l l y when I saw this news. I had
been obeying the injunction i n the Calendar to "
"belong to I.C. clubs i n preference to outside
clubs". I had been cutting out v i s i t s to the
(too proletarian!) cinema i n preparation for
joining i . c . f . s . instead, and so on. I was also
(though unavoidably a green ticketeer) r e l i n -
quishing a hitherto v i v i d interest i n the World .
and People i n general^ and fast becoming absorbed
exclusively i n Imperial College as advocated by
implication by your o r i g i n a l correspondent on
"green ticketing".
Then to my disgust I discovered that the
editor of FELIX considers i t permissible, even
desirable, to eat elsewhere than at the I.C.
Refectory Club. Surely i n view of general I.C.
policy this is a most pernicious and deplorable
suggestion and I can only hope that I.C. w i l l
remain as isolated from and independent of the
outside world as i t has been i n the past.
* Surely not ticketer - racket:racketeer: : green
ticket: green ticketee.r!
Yours truly,
N. Sijdrawde.

F i n a l arrangements are now under way for
the LU.B.3. production of "Lazarus," Scott-
Moncrleff's t r a n s l a t i o n of the three-act drama
by the modern I t a l i a n playwright P i r a n d e l l o .
Last season's L.U.D.S. production at I.C.
saw them out of the red for the f i r s t time for
years. Following on this success they are
putting on their new play at the Watergate
Theatre, Charing Cross. Chris McKoen, who w i l l
be remembered for his performance i n F . 6 . , i s
producing the play; Lucio, the p r i n c i p a l male
part, is to be played by Lawrence M i l l e r (I.C.)j
the female lead, Sara, mother of Luclo, is being
taken by Edna Carson (I of E ) .
The college i s well represented, so there
Bhould be plenty of I.C. support for this new
venture on'December 4th - 9th i n c l u s i v e .
COLLEGE RiiGS OR HOOLIGANISM
Dear S i r ,
It is evident that you support the frequent
thoughtless assaults on the law-abiding public
by students.
On almost every occasion that these "r..gs"
take place, some innocent member of the despised
p r o l e t a r i a t is seriously inconvenienced, or,
as so often happens, is caused unnecessary
expense by the damaging of his pr her clothes.
Are the hooligans who perpetrate these out-
rages to be excused, nay supported, on the grounds
that they are University scholars?
Is i t commendable that a business man on his
wjiy to an important conference should L< prevented,
or at least delayed, from doing so, during the cause
course of a rag?
Is t h e vandal to be encouraged who spoils be-
yond hope of renovation the newly-purchased costume
of a woman bystandcr i n P i c c a d i l l y by covering her
with a mixture of soot and flour?
These incidents are not mere fabrications or
just isolated examples, but, with many others, of
a s i m i l a r brand, are the events that have been
gleefully related to me by some member or other
of a college "expedition".
I, and I am sure other thinking students
w i l l agree with me, h e a r t i l y deplore your sup-
port for t h i s type of behaviour. It .is c e r t a i n l y
not for the 'good of the p u b l i c ' , as you so g l i b -
ly put i t , that outside rags should be allowed to
continue. However, q u a l i f i e d encouragement should
be given to korphy Day and other INTER-COLLEGE
clashes, as they allow the more boisterous among
us to "let off steam," the q u a l i f i c a t i o n being
that the inoffensive onlooker is not involved.
Yours etc.
J . D. Ault,
(R.C.S. )
S i r ,
I am e n t i r e l y i n agreement with the a r t i c l e ,
i n your l a s t issue, on Rags". Their present
deplorable state was I l l u s t r a t e d by the debacle
at U.C. on November 5th. It had i t s moments,
but they were very few, and came only after a
two hour warming up period. There was quite a
good turn-out on a dreary night, and with a l i t t l e
organisation we could almost have taken 'U.C.
apart, b r i c k by b r i c k , removed the surface of
Gower Street to a depth of six feet, and f i l l e d
up Trafalgar Square with the rubble, policemen
and a l l .
I repeat "Roll on Morphy Day", but lette have
a l i t t l e less misdirected high s p i r i t s and a
l i t t l e more e f f i c i e n t l y planned a c t i o n .
Yours,
f e e l i n g strongly on the subject,
"iggy."
The Editor takes no responsibility for views expressed
in Readers' Letters. Correspondence is invited, but
should be as brief as possible.
S i r ,
The present arrangement of the Coming Events
column looks p r e t t i e r than the previous one, but
conveys l e s s information. Down here, i n the
wild3 of Berkshire, i t would be preferable to
have the c l a s s i f i e d l i s t of events (including
'ordinary club a c t i v i t i e s ) under t h e i r appropriate
dates, as, owing to the way i n which club officers
persistently ignore the existence of Silwood, l i t t l e
news of what is going on percolates to us. My
p a r t i c u l a r grumble at the moment i s that I never
know whether the next Saturday is a hop Saturday
or not, and I cannot drop in to find out; ."drop-
ping i n " means a 5/- coach fare. W
e are i n t e r e s -
ted i n club a c t i v i t i e s , but we cannot arrange our
v i s i t s to London to suit them; i t i s a question
of going to what happens to be on on the days
when we are "up from the country". So i f t h i s
heartfelt plea does not have any effect on club
o f f i c e r s , perhaps you c o u l i manage'to give us
the information through your columns.
Yours e t c .
Joan M. Slow
Silwood Park,
liith November, 1951
(We became aware of a f a i l u r e to give
'Hop' details and this w i l l be r e c t i f i e d .
We also intend to put more items i n 'Coming
Events', but we cannot l i s t every item of
regular events as anything of special interest
i s then swamped. Editor)
