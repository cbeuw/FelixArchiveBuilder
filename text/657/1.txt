NEWSPAPER OF COLLEGE UNION
Free Beer and Ciggies
Police were called in after the Bonfire Night Party in the JCR
last Friday when the Bar was broken into and the contents of a
barrel of Fosters lager and several hundred cigarettes were stolen.
the party when the bar had closed
and the bar staff had gone home.
The Police are no longer
involved and the matter is being
dealt with internally since it is felt
by the College Secretary, Mr
John Smith, that College would
be better at dealing with the
culprits than the Courts. A
possible reason for dealing with
the matter internally is that the
Union is worried that any black
marks in Scotland Yard would
predjudice chances of future bar
extensions in the JCR.
Alan Larson, the JCR Bar
Manager, found the bar had been
broken into when he arrived on
Saturday morning. The Police
were called in and fingerprints
were taken off the bar by the
metropolitan forensic team.
Intially it was thought that the
bar had been broken into in the
very early hours of the morning
since nothing suspicious was
noticed during a security check at
three o'clock in the morning.
However it seemed unlikely that
anyone would take the trouble to
break into the bar at four o'clock
in the morning, consume an
entire barrel of lager and then
sneak out again. The feeling now
is that the theft occurred during
Anyone at the party who saw
anything suspicious should call
Mr Geoffrey Reeves, Chief Secu-
rity Officer, as soon as possible.

Tea Room Stays Closed
The Botany Zoology tea room will now definitely not be
opening this year if Head of Department Professor Ronald Wood
has his way. Earlier this year there were hopeful signs of the tea
room reopening, however negotiations between Professor Wood
and Mr Tim Wilson, Life Sci Dep Rep, have broken down.

The tea room has been a centre
of staff/students social life for
many years. Students were able
to meet staff informally over a
cup of tea.
Without this social centre the
department is blighted. The com-
fortable atmosphere that once
existed in the division has gone.
Tim Wilson said he was dismayed
by Professor Wood's attitude and
he felt that the situation was tra-
gic.
Last February, Mrs Shirley
Varey, a member of the division's
technical staff who ran the tea
room fell ill. Mr Ian French, as-
sistant departmental supervisor,
tried desperately to keep the tea
room open by working unpaid in
his own time.
This attempt failed though be-
cauuse of the pressure of work on
Mr French and his volunteers.
This gave Professor Wood the
chance had been waiting for. In
an attempt to save £2,500 he
closed the tea room.
Students and staff were united
in their opposition to the closure.
A petition was circulated and was
signed by over 300 people
including every member of the
academic staff (except Professor
Wood) and the majority of
clerical staff and students. The
Rectors Committee was ap-
proached and they supported the
need for the tea room.
Professor Wood claims that he
cannot afford to keep the tea
room going. However the money
needed is only 0.25% of the
departmental budget.
Many members of staff, feel
that Professor Wood is bging
| unnecessarily intransigent. Mr Ian French
