Sexually
Frustrated
Dear Pallab
How refreshing it was to see
the cartoon on the cover of the
Careers Edition of F E L I X
recently, it provided a breath of
irreverent fresh air in this
community of rampant con-
servatism.
With this in mind I feel I must
draw your attention to the
drivel-packed letter of com-
plaint you published last week,
submitted, no doubt, by a
sexually frustrated public
school matron under the pseud-
onym of J Martin Taylor.
I found this letter extremely
boring, and was offended at the
condescending way M r Taylor
attempted to reprimand the
cartoonist responsible.
It is this killjoy attitude
peddled by a number of morally
dangerous individuals (Michael
Newman included) against
which George Orwell warned us
in his novel 1984.1 plead to such
people to grow up and refrain
from being such wet blankets.
Yours worriedly

Fascists
Dear Pallab
In reference to Martin Tay-
lor's letter last week. If a
government, which declares it
has already made the decision
to shoot the unarmed Green-
ham Peace Women if they get in
the way isn't fascist then which
adjective would you apply?
M u r d e r o u s , c o l d - b l o o d e d ,
butcherous and inhumane are a
few words which seem appro-
priate.

Opsoc
vs Ents
Dear Sir
I would just like to set the
record straight concerning the
article in last week's F E L I X
complaining about the booking
of the Union Concert Hall by
the Operatic Society next term.
Firstly, performing societies
such as Opsoc and Dramsoc
need considerable time for
building sets which, as anyone
who has seen one of their shows
Page 2 • O n H H B I
will know, are usually of a very
high standard. This work is
often carried out at weekends
because it is the only time the
stage crews can get together for
reasonably long, uninterrupted
sessions.
Secondly, prior to the article
and after discussion with Ents,
who adopted a somewhat nega-
tive attitude throughout, the
Operatic Society released the
first two weeks of term and
prepared to negotiate further
on the question of Friday
evenings in January.
Thirdly, the productions by
Opsoc and Dramsoc are regular
features of the social and
cultural life of the college; this is
a fact of which Ents should have
been aware of anyway.
Finally, it seems to me that
the Concert Hall is entirely
unsuitable for groups of the
calibre of B52s due to the size of
the stage and audience facilities.
In future, I feel that Ents should
concentrate on securing venues
such as the J C R for most bands,
whereas the Great Hall is the
only adequate location for
major gigs and I wish the Union
every success in attempting to
reopen this venue for rock
concerts.
Yours faithfully
Clive Paget
SCAB Chairman
PS: I understand that Christine
Teller has managed to secure
the Great Hall for two rock
concerts in February already.
The point is, Clive, that these
gigs Christine has got permission
for are private gigs which cannot
be advertised outside College.
The Union has always been able
to obtain the Great Hall for these
types of gigs. However there is
little point in getting the Great
Hall if only a 100 or so people
turn up-Ed.
Freshers Eye
View
Dear Pallab
When I came to IC I expected
to find a student union lacking
the usual stereotyped political
domination, a union concerned
with the more mundane inter-
ests of its member (ignorant
twit I hear you cry). In place of
this I find the place is run by a
bunch of insular hacks who
wouldn't take much notice of a
normal student if they could
recognise one. I am dismayed
even by the predictability of the
content of your esteemed rag
(and I dare you to print this bit).
Most students I have met are
more interested in getting a
decent degree and having a
reasonable social life, so I don't
suppose will see much change in
the usual sucking up to College
by I C U hacks (people with a
proven ability to cock up a piss
up in a brewery). I doubt Ents
will ever get a group I have
heard of and I predict U G M s
will only be prevented from
inquoracy by R S M and the
trendy left squad.
I note also you slag off Guilds
freshers b/iffets as a fiasco
whereas I have yet to hear a
complaint and felt they were a
vast improvement over formal
dinners. Are you party to a
conspiracy to stamp out C C U
subversion? I note a great
enthusiasm to slag off Guilds
particularly.

I was terribly afraid that my

Pertinent
Questions
Dear Pallab
I would like to raise a few
points which I feel are relevant
to everyone at the College.
Perhaps someone in this Col-
lege of ours can explain the
reasoning behind them.
1. Why axe the refectories
under the control of a certain
person? What I am asking is,
why doesn't someone else man-
age them. If this happened they
could more than pay for
themselves by being a cheap,
clean and having good quality
food. They would pay for
themselves because all students
would (I guess) use them.
2. Why are the bars more
expensive than other U L bars (I
know cos I've drunk in others)?
If they were cheaper more
people would use them (I
guess). Perhaps F E L I X could
hold a ballot to see if this is true.
3. Why is the Bookshop not
cheaper than other bookshops
(which run to make a profit!)?
Why is its good selection of
stationery so expensive? Is it
because it has a virtual mono-
poly, owing to its position.
4. Why is the Southside
Shop so expensive. (Own brand
baked beans 16p from Sains-
burys; only brand 25p from the
shop) and poorly stocked?
Can I suggest one thing to
everyone. If you agree with me
boycott these services. Foyles
and Dillons and easy to get to
and just as expensive. Bring
sandwiches if you live out. Cook
your own food if you don't. Go
down U L U bar(10-15pcheaper
a drink) at Euston—really
easier to get to. Shop in a
supermarket (but not Europa)
or if resident use your Hall's
coop.
If you don't agree—carry on
being a sucker.

Masterplan
Dear Pallab
Sorry to spoil a good story
(just think of the headlines you
are going to miss: Sherfield
Split, Smith Drops 5 Levels,
College Secretary Encamped on
Queen's Lawn) but my move
along the corrdior was part of
my own plan to achieve a
consoldiated and more effective
administration while the Rector
has to devote a fair amount of
time to the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals.
The only person who may feel
snubbed is my snob; I am not
putting in as much mileage.
Yours sincerely
John Smith
College Secretary
