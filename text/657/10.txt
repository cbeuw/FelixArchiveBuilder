Lewes Trip came off well, we sold over 500
Rag Mags to the people on campus at
Guildford and had a fine time attempting to
get into pubs in Lewes. As usual the disaster
on this trip was the coach driver who decided
to circle Guildford's one way system twice
before plucking up courage for the cross
country trip over to Lewes—before being hit
by a drunk driver on the way back.
The next day Jez gatecrashed the old
crocks run to Brighton—beating the plastic-
bodied fiat Guilds borrow off Sir Hugh Ford
for the occasion.
Come to Rag Week in which you will,
find lots of RCSU events, so come along and
join in.
Also, today at 12:45pm above Southside
Bar is a RCS Rag Committee meeting to
finalise details of Rag Week. So be there.
Have fun.
Dave
haven't much time, even now I can hear
the slap-slap of alien feet on the stairs. God, I
hope FELIX don't cut this article before the
door gives out because I must tell you
about—Christ, they're in, their metallic an-
tennae searching the air. I must tell you,
don't.
Congratulations to Bo on making a success-
ful trip to Brighton, and congratulations to
his supporters for stuffing RCS on the bump-
er cars, as usual.
Unfortunately Mike Stuart had to go swim-
ming by himself as Mark's ankle had an
argument with a slide—and he's still in hospi-
tal.
Don't forget that tomorrow is the Lord
Mayor's Show, when the Guilds float,that
Siwan Chamberlain has been building for the
last month,tours the City of London.
Then on Wednesday, Rag Week begins
with the inter-CCU raft race where we race
(and beat) RCS and Mines across the
Serpentine and back.
Stoic
Welcome to another week of hand made
television. Next week on Tuesday you can
have a tube with Dame Edna Everage as she
insults, embarrases and pours tea over a past
STOIC interviewer; and on Thursday our
news and information service for the jet-
lagged, News-Break, is back as usual. First
Ben-Hur; then Star Wars; then the Wombles;
and now this—it's better than a refectory
meal (and it doesn't repeat as quickly). (But it
does make you throw up-Ed).
Vegsoc
Vegsoc got off to a good start this year with 38
people joining at the 'Fruit and Vegetable
Tasting'. This unusual event was a great suc-
cess and thoroughly enjoyed (apart from the
seaweed!). Don't worry if you missed it—
we'll probably hold another.
Our lunchtime meetings will now take
place on Mondays and Fridays. Meet at 12:45
at Beit Arch for lunch at the RCA. These
meetings are completely informal, just come-
along when it's convenient.
We hope to have fortnightly evening meals
on Tuesdays, either in people's rooms or a
Union room. These follow the old formula of
everyone bringing something and chaos ensu-
ing!
Finally, if you have any suggestions for
events, restaurant trips, campaigns, etc, let us
know at a meeting.
Go Club
Anyone interested in joining this- newly-
formed club (affiliated to Wargames) should
come to the Senior Common Room in the
Union Building ('Wargames Room') on Wed
16 Nov at 1:30pm or contact L Holland,
Physics 2. Anyone from complete beginner
