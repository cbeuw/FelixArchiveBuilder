Alarm ring
in another
new wave
'Some people say we've sold out, but I
say to those, Satan get behind me' was
M i k e P e t e r s e m p h a t i c d e n i a l of
accusations that the Alarm had 'gone
commercial'. But it is impossible for a
good band, and the Alarm are good, not
to sell records and pack out venues.
The Savoy Ballroom (an annex of The
Boston Arms) was packed out. Situated
next to Tufnell Park tube station, the
Ballroom, with over a thousand people
squeezed in, making breathing difficult,
doesn't quite fit in with the Alarm's idea
of playing small venues. The room was
very reminiscent of the pillared J C R ,
though the higher ceiling allowed for
much improved acoustics. A slightly

The Alarm's use of Epiphone 6-string
a c o u s t i c a n d a c o u s t i c bass a l w a y s
seems to cause trouble (like the almost
complete lack of bass at the Lyceum in
March) but the sheer enthusiasum of the
band and the way the front three (Mike,
Eddie and Dave) swop around on vocals
and guitars and thrash the hell out of
them covers the finer problems with the
PA and sound balance. All the singles,
Unsafe Building, Marching On, The
Stand and their anthem 68 Guns, were
covered in the set, with the inclusion of
the poignant Tell Me a song about life
after a prison sentence. A further six

The Alarm have come a long way from
their 'mod' days as 17 supporting such
bands as Dexy's Midnight Runners at the
Cardiff Palais. Inspired by U2 (Blaze of
Glory is d e d i c a t e d to B o n o ) a n d
renamed after the first song they wrote
together, Alarm Alarm, the band has
built up a substantial live f o l l o w i n g
s u p p o r t i n g the J a m , U 2 , Stiff Little
Fingers and The Beat. Indeed, like U2,
the A l a r m have been labelled as a
'Christian' band, but the title is as equally
inappropriate as 'acoustic punk'. Their
lyrics do show an obsession with conflict
and the metaphors of war, though. Third
Light is a prime example:
So here I stand, by your grave side,
' The steel helmet lies upon your cross.
They say you died for King and Country,
But that's no comfort to the life you've lost.
In Across the Irish Border they voice
the futility of the conflict but carefully
don't take sides. Marching On, their
second single, expresses an optimistic

X Pistol and the
Cowboys
Once upon a time, Johnny Thunders taught Steve Dior how to play guitar and
Dior went on to call his band London Cowboys and dedicate their debut
album—Animal Pleasure-to Thunders' old band, the New York Dolls. These
observations and the fact that L o n d o n C o w b o y s are large in France (hit singles,
albums and tours) tend to make the band seem a bit of a laughing stock. I mean,
what do the French know about rock'n'roll—even Plastic Bertrand was Belgian.
Since the album is only available on import it is not possible to pass fair
judgement on the C o w b o y s although reliable sources say they are good live.
The band have received a mixed reaction from the music press—the Melody
Maker recently raved about them whilst the New Musical Express dismissed
them as 'plain ridiculous' Given that most IC students seem to read Sounds
you'll have to make up your own mind—and possibly see ex-Pistol Glen Matlock
who plays with the band.

theme of hope which runs through most
of their songs:
The Power on the Right Side,
Fights the Power on the Left.
We have got to stand together;
Forget the East and West.
A s Peters says 'With so many tribes out
there, all possibly afraid of being tolerant
at each other, music can unite us. We're
all on the same side, the government
hasn't got anything real to offer. None of
us are.of any political party, we just get
on with the politics of youth.'
The follow-up single to 68 Guns is
rumoured to be Blaze of Glory and the
debut album is planned to be recorded

appearances, a top twenty single and an
extensive U K tour starting in January, it
might seem that the Alarm are on the
point of selling themselves down river. I
hope that the process is not an inevitable •
consequence of the commercial success
the Alarm seem destined to enjoy.
