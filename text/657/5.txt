puts the case against.
THE TRUTH
A B O U T NUS
Last week Neil Stewart made a nifmber of claims about the
possible benefits of NUS membership. In this article I have
answered many of the points he raises and followed this with an, I
hope, illuminating description of what NUS is really like.
Firstly, he claims that NUS has
cut its bureaucracy since we left in
1977. This may be true to some
extent, but it has been cut relatively
little. A reduction to 'only' 70 per-
manent staff is hardly a break-
through. Large student unions only
employ this sort of number in
order to provide facilities such as
refectories, shops, bars, etc, all of
which provide real services direct to
students. NUS still spends well over
a million pounds, the vast majority
on administration, salaries and
conferences.
He says that NUS has 'disposed'
of its large commercial empires. In
truth much of this empire, which
included NUS Travel, NUS Mar-
keting and Endsleigh Insurance
amongst others, went bankrupt in
1976 due to mismanagement
caused by political interference in
commercial decisions. Endsleigh
was sold off and the rest of the
companies were liquidated. For Mr
Stewart to write that NUS now
concentrates on influencing com-
pany policies and coordinating the
purchasing power of students is a
clever way of saying that NUS is
incapable of organising any com-
mercial ventures. This incapacity is
solely due to the political nature of
services
bankrupt
NUS, without which service com-
panies could be successfully run.
NUS has changed to a system of
compulsory election of delegates to
its conferences, but there are still
exceptions for the many small
colleges. And its unrepresentative
nature is demonstrated by the fact
that 14 out of 17 executive members
are members of the Labour Party,
which even they don't claim reflects
the political views of students.

Thirdly, he talks about the expense
of joining the NUS. No-one has yet,
it seems, been able to put a figure
on what our subscription would be.
A figure of £13,000 was bandied
about last year, but Mr Stewart's
'no more than £4 or £5 a head' leads
to a figure of between £18,000 and
£22,500. If he is right (and he
should know what he's talking
about) this represents the total
slashed!
amount of money that ICU spends
on C&GU and RMSU combined,
. or our entire publications budget
(including FELIX). It is half what
we spend on all our sports clubs, it
represents the cost of employing all
four sabbaticals or half our per-
manent staff. Since it would in fact
be impossible to make the saving
from cutting out any single area,
and since approximately half of our
money goes on fixed costs such as
salaries and insurance, short of
sacking staff the only way to raise
the money would be by making
severe cuts of up to 20% in the
financing of clubs and societies,
and the CCUs. It is totally
Unrealistic to expect the College to
come up with more money at the
expense of sacrificing research.
Then Mr Stewart goes on to make
extravagant claims about sums of
money 'saved' by NUS for students
at Lancaster. To claim each and
every Government decision which
happens to be of benefit to students
as a victory for the NUS is arrant
nonsense. There are many much
more influential groups when it
comes to education and welfare
lobbying, such as the Committee of
Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP), the UGC, and university
and college authorities. If they are
\ Friday, 11 November, 1983\
unable to persuade the Govern-
ment to change its mind what
chance has NUS got, either with or
without ICU in membership. The
House of Lords judgement on
overseas, students entitlement to
grants was the culmination of five
years of legal battle brought by
individual students, and whilst ICU
(and in particular our welfare
adviser) was instrumental in initi-
ating the process, NUS involve-
ment has been minimal. Hk fails to
mention the many issues on which
the NUS has totally failed to
change the Government's mind,
along with the other bodies men-
tioned earlier. Crucially, these
include grants (every year) and full-
cost fees for overseas students.
Imperial College has an excellent
welfare service and the Union
employs a full-time welfare advisor
to help students get the most from
benefits like rent and rate rebates.
We have employed an adviser ever
since we left NUS, using some of
the money we saved by leaving. I
am certain that one full-time
advisor working here at IC can do
far more for us than all 70
permanent staff at NUS head-
quarters put togehter, and at a
much lower cost.
Of course our welfare service
does sometimes take information
from NUS publications. But to say
we are being dishonest and not
admitting we are using it is untrue,
and it is not obtained clandestinely.
Most of what we use is freely
available for purchase by anyone
and we pay for it and credit NUS
for producing it. The information is
anyway easily available from other
sources if we didn't get it from
NUS.
The provision of welfare inform-
ation and support to College
welfare services should be the
primary function of NUS, but it is
one which it performs badly. To
take one example, the head tenancy
agreements which result in secure
accomodation for several hundred
Imperial College students were
developed by our welfare service
independently of NUS. Being NUS
members would not have helped at
all since they have done no work on
this important subject due to the
fact that they are politically op-
posed to private landlords. It seems
that NUS operates purely as a
protest body with a complete lack
of new ideas and imagination.
time-wasting
rhetoric
In dealing with the points raised by
Mr Stewart I have come back
several times to the question of
NUS's political side. NUS is party
political through and through. He
gives this away when he says that
NUS's proportional representation
system gives one executive post for
one sixth of the votes, two for one
fifth, etc. In order to get elected and
get any real influence on NUS it is
necessary to have the backing of a
political party, or rather the
1 student wing of the party. All the
j political parties have student
sections — from the Communists to
the Conservatives. The National
> Organisation of Labour Students
(NOLS) presently controls NUS
having won it from a Communist/
Liberal alliance two years ago.
Within each group there are the
usual factions and infighting. To
look at NOLS in particular, the
faction known as Clause Four is in
control but is fighting against
strong opposition from the Mili-
tant Tendency. Mr Stewart is a
member of NOLS, the Labour
Party and Clause Four. There is
nothing wrong with'this in itself.
politics
before
but can he and the other four NUS
sabbaticals really be concentrating
on students' welfare when their first
loyalty is to the political organis-
' ations which put them in office.
Those who saw Mr. Stewart in
action atTuesday's UGM will know
that he is a very able politician—he
needs to be, because student politics
makes the real thing look like a
vicarage tea party. Against this
background the five delegates IC
would get would have precious little
effect, unless they themselvesjoined
in the political fun and games.
It is evident that the NUS is
fundamentally a party political
football which, far from existing to
protect the welfare of students, has
become its own reason for its
existence. Its activities in the field
of student welfare are limited and
are largely linked to the political
views of the controlling faction.
NUS conferences must be the
ultimate in time-wasting rhetoric-
hundreds of people meeting to
discuss topics ranging from the
atom bomb to abortion, from
South Africa to sexism, frorn which
transpires absolutely nothing.
Yet I still believe there is a role for aN
national welfare body to help and
advise student unions. The NUS is
not going to reform itself, with or
without our participation—
conferences don't vote themselves-
out of existence. But maybe, if
someone took the initiative, \ a
genuinely useful body could be set
up without NUS's poiitcial appen-
dages. Such a body could perhaps
make a valuable contribution to
student welfare at reasonable cost.
It is no coincidence that the main
supporters of NUS at IC are groups
like the Liberals and Labour Clubs,
which are affiliated to the ULS and
NOLS. It seems Mr Stewart is, with
their help, trying to launch a
carefully orchestrated campaign to
get us back into the NUS. We want
our' money to be spent on the
benefit of all our students, not to
further the political aims of small
groups in College. In the interests
of all our students we must reject
reaffiliation to the NUS.
