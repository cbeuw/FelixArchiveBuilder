We've Had Enough!
Conditions in one of the
College's Head Tenancy
residences have deteriorated to
such an extent that the residents
are refusing to pay rent until
substantial improvements are
made or the rent reduced. The
residence, number 6 Earls Court
Squafe, houses students in
double and single rooms with
communal facilities.
The kitchen is infested with
cockroaches and standards of
decoration and furnishing are
very poor. Paints is peeling off
the walls, the lino has gaping
holes in it, the bathroom floor
leaks and the furniture in the
rooms is so bad that some
residents have thrown out chairs
and beds. Redecoration has not
been carried out for over three
years and two rooms in particular
are unlettable.
The rent charged for these
rooms is an exhorbitant Â£27 per
week for single rooms. Number 6
Earls Court Square has become
the Student Services Office's
refuge of last resort where people
with absolutely no where else to
go are sent. The majority of
students there are looking to get
out as soon as they can.
The landlady Ms Seddon has
been unwilling to spend any
mon^y on the property, and it has
been difficult to bring pressure on
her to make imporvements since
she refuses to deal directly with
the Manager Gary Turner or the
Student Services Office. All
defects have to be reported via
the Estates department, which
can involve considerable delay.
Some blame clearly lies with the
College who have failed to ensure
that the landlady carried out
adequate repairs in the past. The
residents hope that by
withholding their rent they will
force the College to take
immediate action.
FELIX Gets Results
Victor Mooney, the Refectory
Manager, warmly thanked
FELIX for bringing the filthy
state of the Union Dining Hall to
his attention. (This was reported
in FELIX on 21 October.) Mr
Mooney was absolutely furious
when he read the article and took
immediate action to censure the
member of staff responsible, a Mr
Parsons.
The FELIX expose of the
School of Economic Science has
proved useful to Geoffrey
Reeves, the Head of Security.
This group have applied to use
College premises for their
meetings, and Mr Reeves is
reconsidering their application in
the light of the article, which
appeared as a centre spread in the
21 October issue.
Ex-Head of Department
Has Stroke
Professor Dan Bradley, former
Head of the Physics Department,
has suffered a serious stroke. His
sudden . illness has come as a
shock to his many friends in the
department. He is paralysed
down his right-hand-side and is
unable to talk. His condition is
improving daily and he is now
able to get around in a wheelchair
and walk with help.
Prof Bradley came to the
Physics department from
Queen's University Belfast in
1973, bringing a large group of
laser physicists with him.'He
had been Head of Physics in
Queen's since 1966 and pre-
viously had lectured at Royal
Holloway and Imperial. When he
returned to Imperial, he became
Professor of Applied Optics.
Three years later in 1976. he
became an FRS and also became
Head of the Physics department.
In 1980 he returned to Ireland,
only this time to Trinity College
Dublin to a specially created
Chair of Optical Electronics.
Despite R C S gatecrashing the Brighton Run with Jez their
vintage fire engine, Bo, Guilds' veteran mascot beat her to the
finishing line.
Being a race for pre-1904 veteran vehicles Jez could only run
unofficially. Both finished in the first hundred. Bo, being a 1902
James & Browne, receiving an official placing.
Potatoes on the Brain
Refectory Manager Victor
Mooney has got potatoes on his
mind at the moment. Recently he
discussed the high price of pota-
toes at length at the College
House Committee. However in
addition what has really got
Victor worried is the number of
chips being bought. As a man
who always has the interests of
students at heart, Victor is
concerned that too many chips
will ruin students health. He is
even considering getting the
Health Centre to issue a warning.
Perhaps the Health Centre
should extend the warning to in-
clude all Mooney's food.
No More Sex Shows
There will be no more porno-
graphic events on Union pre-
mises after the passing of the anti-
pornography motion at
Tuesday's Union General Meet-
ing. The motion was passed by
212 to 157 votes.
The consequences of the mo-
tion are that no club, society or
Constituent College Union will
be able to organise pornographic
events on Union premises and
that Imperial College Union will
not be associated with any
pornographic event outside Col-
lege.
An ecstatic Michael Newman,
proposer of the anti-porn motion
said that the sight of the Miners
leaving the Hall when they
realised they could not win was
"the most beautiful sight" he had
ever seen. The Royal School of
Mines Unidh will be attempting
to reverse the motion at the next
UGM.
The vote on the motion was
carried out by paper ballot.
Allegations of ballot rigging
came from both sides since it was
felt that people were voting with
several ballot papers. Mr
Newman has lodged a complaint
to the Union Honorary Secretary
Mr Sean Davis. RSMU officers
claim that the ballot is void if
there is any evidence of ballot
rigging.
The motion on Nicaragua w
a
*
s
passed narrowly by 113 votes for
'to 111 against. Union President
Gaynor Lewis will be writing to
Ronald Reagan asking him to
stop US i n t i m i d a t i o n in
Nicaragua or otherwise he would
have the full military might of IC
Union to answer to.
Another surprise Was the warm
reception accorded Neil'Stewart,
President of NUS. Despite being
elected on a blatantly anti-NUS
ticket, Gaynor Lewis Union
President seems to be moving
closer to a pro-NUS stanfce. This,
dramatic change seems to have
come about since meeting hjfeil
Stewart at a weekend conference
earlier in the year (nudge, nudge,
say no more-Ed).
Mr Stewart outlined the five
major changes made within the
NUS since IC disaffiliated 6 years
ago.
In view of these changes Mr
Stewart felt IC ought to hold a
referendum on re-affiliation and
eventually vote in favour.
In answering a wide variety of
questions he spoke briefly on the
moral obligations on IC to join in
view of benefits we already
receive but primarily on the cost
