of membership and the recent
successes of NUS.
He pointed out that the money
paid to College by Local
Education Autorities already
contains an element for
representation at national level
which should be used to pay our
affiliation fee of £15,000 and that
some colleges of simlilar size to
Imperial pay over £30,000 in
annual affiliation fees because
they receive more than IC.
However Christine Teller,
Deputy President, pointed out
that the quoted allocation to ICU
£214,000 was not realistic
because College pays for
cleaners, electricity etc.
His other major argument was
the success of NUS in postponing
the abolition of student loans,
London weighting, minimum
grants and traveling expenses. He
also spoke at length about
successes at South Bank
Polytechnic and Lancaster
University concerning benefits
and increased accommodation.
Howevere there was confusion
over whether the NUS or IC were
responsible for the recent legal
victory over fees for overseas
students in the House of Lords.

U G M Sketch
Tuesday's Union General Meeting
began in traditional shambolic
style without any microphone and
the one which did arrive seeming to
have little effect bar lowing Chair-
man John Passmore's aggressive
bark by at least 10 decibels (no bad
thing) and raising it an octave. The
nadir was an election for one
ordinary member of a committee
nobody ever attends (Academic
Affairs); particularly the obligatory
'I'm not really a hack and now seem
to be lost for words' speech which
would have been embarrassing if it
hadn't have been so unoriginal.
The only other items of interest
in the first half were the clothes
worn by the seconders in another-
election—Ian Bull (next year's
President) wore the worst leather
jacket I have ever seen (at least
three colours) whilst he of the in-
ane grin—Mike Stuart (Guilds Pres)
proved he had a revolting pinkish
shirt (or should that be skirt) to go
with his dress of the same colour. I
mean they made people with
• College sweatshirts look cool.
At times likes this Neil Stewart
(holder of the only noteworthy post
in student politics never held by
John Passmore ie NUS President)
must really have wondered if he
wanted this College in NUS. We
can't speak, we can't listen and are
even pretty poor hands with paper
darts.
Stewart literally wiped the floor
with the other speakers at the
meeting—you may argue that NUS.
is nothing more than a left-wing
talking shop but Stewart is more
than a match for any 'professional'
politician who has ever spoken
here. His speech is reported else-
where but it's worth pointing out
that such rapturous applause
hasn't been heard since the last
Tory Party Conference. And if
Stewart is Mrs Thatcher (no doubt
Sean Davis would be John Cole),
then who is dear old Cecil P?
Perhaps the soon-to-be-married
Passmore, a self-confessed
batchelor and damned fool. And
who is to be Sarah Keays—well
Gaynor Lewis did wobble off (bless
her in her ever so tight little jeans)
halfway through the meeting—
FELIX has some fast bicycles
ready to get her story.
Surprisingly the meeting
managed to pass two motions
despite predictable attempts by
Mines to block them using their
new found toy—the amendment. A
motion condemning US interfer-
ence in Nicaragua was successfully
amended but Mines forgot to
withdraw it and in the confusion it
was passed by a small majority, still
effectively in its original form
although a note estimating the
influence ICU exerts on inter-
national diplomatic affairs was
added. Negotiations with Mews
residents should now be chicken
feed after a move to much higher
things.
The pornography motion was
also passed (212 v 157) possibly due
to excellent pre-planning but more
likely due to a fluke. Before the
motions procedures had been in-
voked to ensure paper ballots for
all the motions and voting slips for
the pornography motion were
distributed during the Nicaragua
motion to save time. When a
RSMU amendment to the motion
was defeated they attempted to
make the meeting inquorate by all
leaving but as voting slips had.
already been distributed while the
meeting was quorate, the vote was
also quorate and the motion
(against Pornography) subse-
quently passed. Doncha love it?
