Union
Have you ever drunk more than
ten different beers in the one day;
seen Mike Stuart wear a pink
dress; collected more than anyone
else in the streets; drink some poor
pub completely dry and then
watch the barman break down
and cry; seen a Gerard Livet film;
taken part in a one hundred man
boat race; taken a dirty weekend
in Paris; watched the C C U execs
drowning in the Serpentine; taken
part in a three team tug-of-war
event (it's not really circular—it's
triangular); been to a Mines Dirty
Disco, a Rag Carnival, the
Smoking Concert, or SCAB
Night; heard about or even seen
Elephant; watch Gaynor and
Christine drink a yard, read a new
F E L I X every day; watched Eric
Darbyshire and Chris Crown-
shaw acting like two old women or
even seen your most appalling
lecturer being hit by the Guilds
Hit Squad?
If you haven't, then watch out
for Rag Week. It is just about to
fall on you like a ton of'bricks and
when it hits it takes almost two
weeks to recover, but will leave
you with scars for the rest of your
lives.
