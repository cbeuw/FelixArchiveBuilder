Who's a pretty boy then?
Oliver Twist (Classic
Haymarket) is well acted and
beautifully shot, but lacks the
bite needed to get you involved.
The main problem is that the
film has been chopped back far
too much from its original US
version. What is left progresses
smoothly enough but is too
bland, lacking emotional peaks
and troughs. Oliver never seems
in real danger, though Tim Curry
as Sykes tries hard.
All the acting is good, as you'd
expect from Eileen Atkins,
Timothy West, Cherie Lunghi
and Sir Michael Horden. Richard
Charles as Oliver gives none of
those cringing moments you
often get with kids on film
although those looks of his are
allowed to be too angelic. He
never seems real. Poor George
C Scott's Fagin has been ham-
mered by the critics, and unfairly.
They compare him too much
with earlier versions. Fagin is not
really an evil Jew (overplayed in
the past) but a kindly old man
trapped half-voluntarily amongst
criminals. Like Nancy, his des-
truction becomes a tragic mis-
take made by all concerned,
including Fagin himself.
Forget temporarily that the
book Oliver Twist was ever
written. Watch this just as a film.
Then it has real merits.

Bullshot (Classic Haymarket) is
exactly what it sounds to be—a
complete send up of Bulldog
Drummond and Britain in the
twenties and thirties.
Bullshot (played by Alan
Shearman) is a clean shaven,
clean living hero. The whole
purpose of his life is to play fair
and to fight for the British
Empire. The beautiful Rosemary
(Diz White) asks him to help her
find her father. Count Otto Von
Druno (Ron House) is the baddie
they end up chasing.
This film is basically a good
laugh, an excellent spoof of those
values upheld by so many
'modern' Tories. Don't expect to
see much of Billy Connolly or Mel
Smith (despite the posters).
They only make brief appear-
ances. It's a pity that the film
couldn't have made more play on
jokes about the pointlessness of
war and so on.
Bullshot is enjoyable—go and
see it, and remember the days
when Britain was Great, men
were Men and the Germans were
called the Hun.

Spacehunter: Adventures in
the Forbidden Zone (various
Classic cinemas) is a reasonably
entertaining B-movie made in
3D, trying to mix Star Wars with
Mad Max.
A mad scientist, Overdog,
rules the plague-infested Terra
Eleven, and likes kidnapping
young girls who are silly enough
to pay his planet a visit. Peter
Strauss, the captain of a salvage
spacecraft, sets off to rescure
three of the girls and collect a
reward. The rest you can predict.
The special effects are average
— flying vultures, bat people,
mutant children—and the 3D
brings the battle scenes specta-
cularly to life. But it isn't all hack
and slay—the one notable char-
acter is Molly Ringwald who
plays an aggressive but emotion-
ally vulnerable teenage orphan
picked up by Strauss to act as a
guide. Even so, Spacehunter
cost $12m—at that price you
expect something more.

The Black Stallion Returns
(U) at the Classic Oxford Street.
OK, kiddies are you ready?
This film is a must if you're ten-
year-old fighting for freedom and
peace and love. I'm sure we
adults have much to learn about
these ideals, but somehow it's all
too phoney.
Kelly Reno plays the typical
ten-year-old, except he's Ameri-
can, has freckles and everything
always turns out just fine, so he
never has to do anything difficult,
like think. They only time this
plot becomes interesting is when
the French Legionaire says to
Kelly, in his saucy French voice:
"If you were mine I would make
your bottom very sore!"
The actual filming, however, is
superb. The Sahara and Arab
culture were taken in with a real
vitality. The best actor was the
Black Stallion himself. This horse
outdoes Lassie and Champion
the Wonder Horse any day.

National Lampoon's Vacation
(most of the ABC cinemas).
For some reason the pro-
ducers of this film seem quite
pleased with their creation—or
at least their bank managers are.
The characters are sup-
posedly an ordinary middle class
family, only a little accident
prone. When the father (Chevy
Chase) decides they are going to
drive across the continent from
Chicago to Los Angeles, every
sort of mishap occurs. The result
is mayhem.
I felt this film never carried the
individual scenarios through pro-
perly. The jokes were well set up
but never quite worked.
Christine Brinkley makes
several appearances as a sex-
crazed poor little rich girl in a red
Ferrari, and eventually goes
skinny-dipping with Chevy
Chase. Unfortunately not a
single glimpse of tit or bum from
her.
My advice to you: Don't
bother. Go and see a good porno
film instead.

Cor! But not a single glimpse of tit or bum.
