interests and their own
prestige to the exclusion of
the rest. Result: yet more
wastage of time and
money.
Lack of cooperation
leads inevitably to chaos.
Carl Burgess has shown
that, no matter how
charismatic the union
president, attempting to
deal with college alone is
doomed to failure. And the
C C U s seem currently to be
no better, being orientated
towards people with
particular traditional views.
Protestations about events
not having to involve
drinking seem to rather
miss the point. Certainly
would be reluctant to go to
the Union Bar for fear of
finding it full of tie club
members and obnoxious
drunks.
Imperial College Union
and its three constitment
unions have a great
potential for truly involving
the vast majority of the
students here. We have at
least avoided the situation
in some of the arts ridden
universities where people
have to be members of a
small political clique in
order to have a say in the
union. But there still seems
to be a problem of terminal
mass apathy.
I had always thought that
prt of union meeting
events organised in the first
few weeks of the year by
these people provide a vital
way for new students to
mix sociallyâ€”but by the
middle of the second term
those attending C C U
events are generally the
habitual inhabitants of the
various union offices and
their immediate friends.
It seems that very few
people in the union are
prepared to take serious
action on matters such as
welfare, challenging college
decisions or response to
government cuts. Why is it
that only places like
Durham, with a letter
writing campaign aimed at
students parents, or
Oxbridge, from where
coincidentally the vast
majority of national
politicians come, make
national headlines? Yet it
seems that if some poor
unfortunate should try to
raise a faintly political point
or criticse some tradition
'ridden item such as
mascotry or rag, they will
meet a barrage of derision
worthy of Militant at its
most facist
The best claim to fame of
the unions this year is that
they have gained control of
a bar which was a liability
to the college catering
operation. Hopefully the
lower floor of the union
building can now be
developed as a regular
evening social centre. But
Moore Lyttle has a difficult
task when many people in
my department, for one,
a science or engineering
based education ought to
be the best way to teach
people to think logically
about problems of all types.
I thought I might find
people in a student union
who were interested in
where the world is going.
Alas I'm exposed as a
hopeless dreamer because
such people are few and far
between. There are a vast
number of students who
show far more concern
about where they are going
out on their free evenings
than they would about, say,
a significant increase in the
number of reported rapes
in London. In many ways
who can blame them
because they are simply
considering their own
immediate problems in a
world that becomes daily
more bewildering. Perhaps
also students are forced to
be rather more conservative
(small c) in today's Britain
where the promise of a
secure future is not as
secure as it used to be. But
that seems to bring to mind
the arguement about the
reputation of your degree.
I doubt whether there are
univerisites where the
problem of apathy is
startlingly better than here.
But the handbooks and
prospectuses portray
Imperial as a leader and a
centre of excellence. Surely
the union ought to ensure
it lives up to this image.
Having seen the turnout
which elected Duncan
Royle as next year's Guilds
president and the success
of Christine Taig I think
there is hope. But I also
think that it is time for the
union to take a strong
objective look at itself. It
seems for example that
there are some ludicrous
cases of competition where
there should be co-
operation. There are three
C C U s plus the IC Ents
Committee all organising
events largely separately
from one another, and
apparently with little
accountability. There are
some clubs and societies,
particularly departmental
societies and less
'glamourous' sports and
social clubs who's activity
is restricted by lack of
funds while some 'prestige'
clubs and events attract
large amounts of money
relative to the numbers of
people involved. Perhaps it
is time for people like
C C U s and IC ents to be
made more accountable for
their spending.
Furthermore executives
should be precisely what
can live up to my own
criteria. It seems there are
people wanting to revive
the issue of NUS
membership and I suspect
that this is a topic which
will see considerable
debate, I hope it won't be
just the same old
characters voicing their
regular opinions. I think in
a lot of other areas the next
twelve months will also
prove crucial to the long
term future of Imperial
College Union. If we do not
produce proposals for
changes of our own accord
they will be forced on us.
The only way to achieve
this is for next years
executive to consult as
widely as possible.
Although it may be too late
to get the best possible
agreement over the future
of the FELIX office there
will be other issues to
follow.
There is one final
requirement both for the
union and the college to
have a healthy long term
future. That is that you
Another sort of union meeting
their definition entails-ie
there to take care of day to
day running and
representation-not
dictatorships however
benign. It is not the job of
union presidents to make
policy alone, neither is it
their job to reach
agreements on matters of
significant consequence
without consultation. It was
once suggested to me that
the most important
requirement of a president
was that they should be 'a
leader of men' but it is
much more important, I
believe, to have a person
who can inspire debate and
listen. The way to improve
the union is not through
gimicky ideas and rhetoric
but through people elected
to positions of
responsibility being
prepared to listen to
opinions other than their
own.
I hope next year as
External Affairs officer I
reading this should take an
interest and form and voice
your own opinions from
what you see and not what
you are told. It is not
important whether you
agree or disagree with what
I may say but whether you
challenge it. If you fail to
take an interest in
informing yourself about
what is going on in the
world around you then you
are doomed to be some
second class technical
nobody in whatever
organisation you find
yourself. If you are content
to let things run as they will
then you deserve to be in a
union that finds itself losing
funds and facilities, you
deserve second rate
teaching, you deserve to
end up forced to live on
student loans and you
deserve when you leave to
be passed over in favour of
graduates from some
provincial university.
