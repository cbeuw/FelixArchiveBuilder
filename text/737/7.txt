Solutions To
Easter Puzzles
Well, we had very few
solutions to any of prize
puzzles. I hope you
enjoyed trying them
anyway—I know lots of
people tried the crossword.
I know a lot of you will
have exams this term, but
I'll keep setting problems
as long as there's some
enthusiasm. I'll try to make
them a little easier, though,
so as not to take up too
much of your precious
time.
A Cable of Cables
I received several solutions
to this problem. Two
people entered correct
answers but with no
explantion as to how they
got their answer. I will only
except these solutions if
the relevant people send
me their explanations. I'll
give you until the next
deadline on Wednesday at
1.00pm. Of course, anyone
else can enter a solution
during that time if they
want to.

What costs ten pence for
one, twenty pence for ten,
and thirty pence for a
hundred?
Front door numbers.
Correctly label the boxes.
Take a marble from the box
marked red and blue, say
it's blue. Since the box was
wrongly marked it must
contain blue marbles only.
Now, the box marked red
cannot contain either red
only or blue only, so it
must be red and blue, and
the remaining box is the
1
one containing reds only.
How can you average
30mph on a journey after
you have completed the
first half of the distance at
15mph?
Impossible, you would have
to complete the second half
of the journey in zero time.
Score three consecutive
goals without anyone else
touching the ball.
Start by scoring an own
goal and then take the kick
off. Kick the ball forward
into the opposition penalty
area and run after it. Before
you touch the ball again
you're brought down inside
the penalty area and you
take the penalty and score.
At this point the whistle
goes for half-time, take the
kick off and repeat the
latter procedure. It is a bit
contrived, but it's only way
it can be done.
Triangle Groper Not Hieroglyphics
The code is simply based
on noughts and crosses, as
shown below.
a b c J. k I s t u
d e f m- n w •X
i h i P' q r y z
First add the extra lines
shown. The triangles A B F ,
A D C , B E C Must each have
area 1/3 by similar trangles
(assume the whole triangle
has area 1). Now
ABF+ADC+BEC+x=1 +(ar-
ea where they overlap).
This means that
ADH+JEC+BFG=x.
By simlar triangles
2 X B G F = G F C ,
2 X J E C = J E A ,
2XDHA=BDH. Now put all
this information onto the
diagram:
It reads: 'If music be the
food of love..' you know the
rest!
Wrong long division
The correct sum is:
1222
47|57434
47
104
94
103
94
Now by using similar
triangles between H F C and
HBF and repeating on the
other two sides we can
show that z=y=w=x. Thus
adding up;
4x+3X(a+b+c)=7x=1.
Thus x is one seventh of
the total area.

Shagar s Sheep
Farmer Shagar's square
farmhouse is surrounded
by a large garden in which
he keeps a small flock of
sheep. He has invented an
interesting method of
counting them. Every
evening he goes to the
windows in each of the four
sides of his house and
counts all the sheep he can
see from the window (he
cannot see around the
corners of the house). I
pointed out the stupidity of
this since he obviously
counts some sheep twice.
'Ahh', he said ' but
sometimes I can work out
exactly how many sheep I
have. For instance, the
, other night I counted the
same number of sheep at
every window, it was nine.
Tonight I also counted the
same number of sheep at
every window, and it was
five. Now if I tell you that
neither time did I count all
the sheep twice, but neither,
time did I count none of
the sheep twice, you
should be able to tell me
how many sheep I have.'
But I couldn't. Can you?
Assume the sheep don't
move while he's going from
window to window.
