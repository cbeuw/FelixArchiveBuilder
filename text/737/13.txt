Jobs For The Summer
Introduction
During the Summer
vacation many of the
college's residiences are let
to visitors from outside the
College. The income from
these schemes is essential
if reasonable rents in the
residences are to be
maintained. The various
Summer Letting Schemes
offer a number of jobs for
the vacation period. These
vary from challenging full-
time managerial posts to
part-time cleaning work. In
general the work is well
paid and interesting and
free accommodation is
provided.
The scheme falls into two
distinct categories. The
S A C Schemes operates in
Linstead Hall and part of
Southside and provides a
standard hotel bed and
breakfast service catering
for conferences and other
short stay visitors. This is
run under the auspices of
the Conference Office. The
other categories includes
Evelyn Gardens, Hamlet
Gardens and Beit Hall and
provides a more basic and
less expensive form of
accommodation where the
clients tend to be students
from other colleges staying
for fairly long periods.
These schemes are run by
Student Services. For all
the schemes, marketing is
carried out centrally but
during the actual period
most of the work of
running and maintaining
the schemes is carried out
by students.
The Schemes
S A C
This is the most prestigious
of the four schemes and
requires a large work force
necessary to maintain high
standards. The office and
reception desk is based in
the foyer of Linstead Hall
and is run by a member of
the Conference Office staff
together with Assistant
Managers, Night Managers,
Cashiers and Receptionists.
The reception desk is
maned day and night
throughout the Summer
vacation. Guests are
welcomed, registered and
billed on arrival by the
reception team and shown
to their rooms by a porter.
Behind the scenes, the
cleaner prepares up to 400
rooms which involves
changing and making beds,
cleaning wash basins and
bathroom and vacuuming
carpets. All this has to be
done in the morning in four
hours. Cleaners work in
pairs, under the supervision
of the Housekeeper and a
co-ordinator, servicing 24
rooms and three sets of
bathroom facilities on a
staricase.
Evelyn Gardens
This is the largest of the
three schemes operated by
Student Services, with up
to 400 guests at anyone
time. All three schemes are
run by assistant managers
under the supervision of a
co-ordinator. The Evelyn
Gardens schemes is staffed
by four assistant managers
and eight cleaners. The
assistant managers run an
office, act as receptionists,
maintain booking charts,
collect rent, operate the
accouting system and
supervise the cleaners. The
cleaners clean rooms,
change sheets and act as
porters.
Hamlet Gardens
At Hamlet Gardens three
assistant managers run 39
flats which provide
accommodation for around
250 guests. There are three
managers and two cleaners
with full time duties similar
to those of Evelyn Gardens
managers. Many of the flats
are organised so as to
provide fairly basic
acommodation but a
number of the best flats are
let fully equipted to families
at a higher rent.
Beit Hall
Beit Hall is somewhat
different from the other
schemes in a number of
ways. In the first place it is
much smaller with only 110
rooms. Also, the
housekeeper of Beit Hall is
heavily involved with the
Vacation Lettings and the
S A C office provides the
reception facilities for the
Beit Schemes. As a result
of these factors we only
need one assistant
manager and two cleaners
for Beit. The assistant
manager is responsible for
raising all invoices, making
sure that guest pay on time
and also co-ordinating with
the housekeeper
All students who work in the Summer Jetting schemes are offered free accommodation and
a competitive wage. Those who work for the whole Summer, are eligile for a bonus.

Co-ordinators receive a £10
per week responsibility
payment in addition to the
above rate. The hours given
for co-ordinators, cleaners
and porters represent a
guaranteed minimum; it is
anticipated that additional
hours will be available for
those who require them.
The hours given for other
staff represent normal
hours but there will be time
when extra hours are
required. Although
overtime is not paid for
14 Friday 25 April
these, extra hours will be
taken into account when
assessing bonuses.
The Summer Lettings
schemes offer an intersting
and generally rewarding
kind of vacation work. At
times the work is very hard,
particularly at the
beginning and end of the
schemes. Those working
the management type jobs
need a lot of stamina and
patience to deal with large
numbers of guests while
working under considerable
pressure. At the same time,
most people who work on
the scheme tend to enjoy
themselves as well as
gaining useful work
experience.
Application forms and
the answers to any
questions you may have
are available from student
Services, 15 Princes
Gardens.
Closing date Monday
12th May.
