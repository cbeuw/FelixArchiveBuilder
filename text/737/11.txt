The Imperial College first

| Senior A crew in th Head of
the River Race, held in
I London during the Easter
break. The race was over a
distance of 41/4 miles and
I is the largest rowing event
in Europe. In a field of over
i 400 British and European
I crews, the first VIII came
eleventh, losing only to
I international crews.
The second VIII came
third in the Senior B
Category and 41st overall,
The Snenior C crews, put
together on the day, came
250th overall. The Novice
I crew came seventh in their
event and 222nd overall.
The Fifth VIII racing in the
Elite class, came 72nd
overall, despite starting one
from last.
The first VIII were the
highest placed university or
college crews, and the
second VIII were the
highest university or
college second crew. These
results show the excellent
depth of talent in the club
and hopes are high for a
successful regatta season.
The first VIII and fifth VIII
were racing in the 'Eric
Ash', the boat purchased
last summer.

Imperial Beat UCL
An impressive victory saw a
strong Imperial team beat
University College by 7:2
after U C had conceded the
final rubber.
The first game on was
mixed and Sean and Sarah
had a tough time beatng a
UC pair boasting a national
player, In fact Imperial lost
the rubber having won a
fast and furious first game.
Sean staggered off,
absolutely knackered, and
blamed their demise on a
piece of mince pie he'd
scoffed earlier and Sarah's
addiction to wispa bars.
First blood thus went to
U C but they had to wait
until the mens singles.
When Tan narrowly lost to
the-above U C players for
their second and final
point.
Super star Robin had a
couple of easy matches.
First in the singles and then
in the ladies doubles
where, partnered by our
intrepio (?) captain, Susan,
she overwhelmed a
potentially strong U C pair.
In her excitement Susan
promptly scoffed half a
packet of biscuits before
going on court with Helen
for the last ladies doubles.
After a good start (Helen
won the knock-up) the IC '
pair soon got confused ano
it ended up with Helen
running in circles round
Susan and Susan running
round herself.
Meanwhile, back in the
mixed doubles, Sarah had
just made a meal of the
remaining biscuits and
Sean was making a meal of
the match. Again the
rubber was decided over 5
games but the IC pair came
out on top after an easy
last game. Sarah promptly
left to go flying and Sean
was left to crawl off court.
In the mens doubles Tan
and Bahret had little
problems winning both
their matches. A usual Tan
looked half asleep, a
casually prancing around
the court leaving all
difficult shots to Barket.
Infact Bharet gave an
impressive display on how
to cover the court without
actually returning a shuttle.
In the other mens match
Bia Dave Heaps got
lumbered with Sean who
had decided he wsa going
to stand at the net and get
the 'dribbly ones'. Dave was
left to do all the running
and his fanatical
screaming, though
disturbing the opposition, it
kept his partner awake.
Needless to say, Sean was
carried off after yet another
3 game rubber

Tour Defeats
Z u i l i c h e n Rotterdam 1
Imperial College 0
Having suffered a nighmare
crossing and the inevitable
lengthy delay at Customs
that seems to afflict all
British teams in Europe,
IC's sporting ambassadors
faced a tough assignment
against the crack Rottedam
outfit. There was almost
trouble before the kick off
as the unfurling of a giant
Union Jack behind a goal
had home officials
screaming for the Dutch
army, until it was realised
that home fans were simply
trying to make IC welcome.
However, even the offering
of a tulip to each player
could not disguise the
Dutch determination to
castrate the proud British
Bulldog and leave him
yelping for mercy.
Pouring rain, flumes of
sheet and a vicious wind
meant that players rather
more 'defrosted' than
'warmed up' during the
preliminaires.and the Duty-
free bottle of rum replaced
the bucket and sponge in
the dug-out.
Zuilichem flattered to
deceive in the early stages,
fancy flicks, feints and
passes weaved pretty,
complicated patterns that
were usually shattered by
the solid intervention of a
Clarke-or Engberg tackle,
and the inevitable referees
whistle. The young FIFA
official was given the
Dutchmen more protection
that in the Mafia, and
suspicious that his
interpretation of physical
contact was more Netball
than Football were
confirmed when Barvery
was cautioned for a
copybook slide-tackle.
On 20 minutes, Van der
Slappkopf, the balding
Dutch schemer, unleashed
a vicious shot which moved
so many ways it could have
knitted a jumper before
Whitehead uneasiyl pushed
it round the post. This
scare seemed to inspire a
Dunkirk type spirit from IC
and they soon began to
take control on a soggy,
beach-like pitch. On loan
striker Rhodes saw a
dipping 20 yards
acrobatically touched over
at full stretch by the Dutch
keeper and moments later
was inches away from
sliding in a ball flashed
across the face of goal by
Lynne.
The half-time whistle saw
the players scurrying for
shelter from the elements ,
although the Dutch
Dishwater brand of tea
reinforced the view that in
Europe competition danger
lurked everywhere.
re-emerging in to a
furious hailstorm and
playing into the teeth of a
biting wind, skipper Lunghi
called for the famous
British stiff upper lip as th
Dutch set up camp in the
IC half. The troops dug in
trenchlike on the edge of
the penalty area and
defended a brave,
rearguard action. A famous
mudsplattered rain sodden
cleansheet looked in sight
when with ten minutes
remaining tragedy struct.
The umpteenth Dutch
corner was sent long an
high, swirling beyond the
farpost, Whitehead,
exuding typical Crobblaar
like fealessness, leapt
skyward, only to be beaten
to the ball left 7inch
stopper, Van der Normuss
whose tumping header
burst the net.
IC hearts bled, tears
welled up and their fierce
patriotic pride was further
wounded with seconds to
go as a Lynne shot was
stopped on the line by what
looked to all, but the
referee, like a defenders
