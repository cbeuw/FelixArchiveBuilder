Rag Fete
•Tomorrow afternoon,the
Queens Lawn area will be
buzzing with activity-to
those old verterans of the
College, the much awaited
annual Rag Fete has
arrived doing its usual
clash with exams whilst to
those still yet to attend one
of these mega events, there
lies an array of
amusements to tickle your
fancy whatever your
mentality. If you haven't
been to one of these Fetes,
I admit there leaves little to
remember about previous
Rag Fetes, but this year
promises to be one to
remember for a long time
coming many first-timers to
the Fete will be making an
appearance; societies you
never knew existed will be
surfacing there, and
hopefully if they go down
well, will become regular
sights each year.
This by no means
deprives the Fete of its
usual favourites of mud-
wrestling (this year against
the ladies Rugby team),
going up to the top of
Queens Tower, Scalextric,
stocks and Jumble stalls.
This year, Dr Who fans
(or similar specimans of the
human race) will revel at
the fact that Sci-Fi Soc will
be showing videos which
are PG (although some
have been banned by the
BBC) and they will be
shown on an auction basis,
auctioning between Dr Who
episodes, Blakes 7,
epidsodes, Space 1999,
Man from U N C L E and
many more.
For those not so turned-
on by these, why not go
and hear Wellsoc's stake at
the Fete? (rhymes good
innit?) For those devoted
Wellsoc supporters, Jason
Reese will be trying to get
one of your favourite
speakers to speak in ME
220.
Plenty of other things to
do, like 'shoot the goalie'
on the lawn, preferably with
a football, hockey ball or
hockey stick, or you could
try knockng down skittles,
throwing eggs, throwing
balloons or better still, if
there aren't any low flying
aircraft around, launch a
balloon in our balloon race.
For those to whom I have
not appealed to yet, there
will be the usual
'refreshments' (know wot I
mean?) on sale, and if
you're still desperate, you
might get to chat to Anne
Diamond from TV am who
is coming to open the Fete
for us. Who knows? If
you're lucky, you might get
to take her to the Rag Fete
Party which is going to be
held afterwards in the
Holland Club, where two of
your favourite college
bands will be playing; D U O
and T H E BEAT BANDITS.
'Refreshments' will be on
sale there also 'till 2.00am.
The theme of the party is a
PUNK party, so come as
your favourite punk
personality (are there any?)
and dance away the end of
a hopefully successful
fund-raising day.
Come along and enjoy
yourselves this year and
see how you can have fun
and at the same time help
us to raise money for your
charities; M E N C A P , Royal
Marsden Hospital, Deaf
Children's society. The
break in your exam revision
will do you a world of
good, and so will the
'refreshments.
