More rag
mag damage
Anger was expressed in the
National Press last week at this
year's Rag Mag following a
longer article published in a
local Bradford paper. The Daily
Star and The Daily Mirror both
ran pieces condemning the
inclusion of Bradford fire jokes

editions).
The controversy was evidently
started by John Renshaw
President of Bradford
university's Student Union, who
denounced the Rag Mag after
last Easter's Rag tour. Mr
Renshaw described the
Bradford fire jokes as 'grossly
offensive' and expressed his
belief that 'Students in Bradford
want to disown themselves from
this publication and it's sick
jokes'.
As well as press coverage, IC
Union have received four letters
of complaint concerning the
racist and sexist nature of some
jokes. Professor Ash told FELIX
that he shares these feelings
and said that he thought the
Rag Mag was pathetic and that
the 'overwhelming majority of
(IC) students must resent it'. He
also felt that the Rag Mag and
the subsequent publicity it
received would dissuade girls
frorn applying to IC, and
parents from allowing them to.
As yet, all complaints have been
received from women.
When asked to defend his
position, Rag Mag Editor Tony
Spencer told FELIX that not
only had his Rag Mag made a
profit for the first time in recent
years but that they sold more
magazines to Bradford students
than anyone else.
Some of the money raised
from the sale of the magazine
will be donated to the Bradford
City Disaster Appeal.
More cuts are
on the cards
Imperial College Union is
supporting a campaign being
run by the University of London
Union (ULU) which aims to
block the current Government
proposals to cut student
benefits.
ULU has devised the
campaign in conjunction with
'Camden Action On Benefits.'
10,000 protest postcards have
been printed, and distributed to
constituent colleges within the
University ,one of which is
Imperial, for students to
complete. They will be delivered
to the House of Commons in
mid-May. The proposals are
currently being studied by a
government committee and will
cost students at Imperial at
least £200 per year. The
Government claims that the
'simplifications' of the method
used to calculate benefits are
not cuts but merely ways of
making savings on
administrative costs. However
the local authorities, who
administer the systems on
behalf of the Government,
cannot give figures on exactly
how much will be saved.
The cards are currently in the
IC Union Office, and anyone
who wants may complete one to
register their opposition.

Following an alert to Southside
Security over Easter that
someone was living rough
somewhere in the building a
man was found sleeping in the
ladies lavatory on the
penthouse level. The man
apprehended gave the name of
an ex-IC student who is
believed to have gone to
Cambridge on completion of his
course here, and was found in
possession of a key to that
persons old room in Falmouth-
Keogh. It is now believed
however that the name he gave
is false and that he is in fact a
failed MSc student attempting
to avoid being forced to return
to Iran where he would be
forced to fight in the war there.
When questioned he admitted
to stealing food from fridges. It
is not known whether this
incidence can be linked to the
theft of mail in Falmouth-Keogh
over Christmas. Don Ferguson
at Student Services said it had
hot yet been decided whether to
take any further action. It is
known that the first student,
believed to have gone to
Cambridge, left without paying
his bill or returning his key and
that College have been keen to
catch up with him for sometime.
Making waves
Boats from Imperial did well at
the largest rowing event in
Europe, with the First VIII being
the fastest in the Senior A
category. Their time was only
beaten by international crews.
The event took place in London
over the Easter break, and had
a field of over 400. Full story
and picture on page 12.
