Islam
Dear Sir,
We would like to clarify
some points about ISLAM
and the ISLAMIC revolution
in Iran. The Islamic
Revolution in Iran was not
simply a change in a
regime and cutting the
hands of both superpowers
from the fate of a nation,
but it was a turning point in
the recent history of the
oppressed people of the
world. By excercising
Islam, this revolution has lit
up a luminous torch
beyond the path of each
movement, aiming to
acheive liberty, greatness,
honour and dignity for
human beings.
The oppressed people of
the world who have
realised the true nature of
the so called Eastern
socialistic and Western
democratic or nationalistic
man-made idealogies, are
now practising Islam
successfully in sorting out
their problems. Islam has
offered them all the values
which other idealogies had
failed to provide.
One of the major social
and political values offered
by the comprehensive
Islamic program to promote
human beings is the
mobilisation of the masses
to take their own right and
cut the hands of
aggressors. In Islam, in the
process of an oppression,
the passive oppressed
person is blamed as much
as the oppressor.
Revival of these aspects
of Islam by Islamic
Revolution in Iran is not
tolerated by any of the
plundering superpowers
and their puppets. This
explains the unified, co-
ordinated and mutually
agreed conspiracies of both
superpowers against Islam
by attacking Iran in all
aspects and by all available
means in spite of all their
fundamental differences.
Directing, sponsoring and
supporting an unequal
imposed war and wave of
murders of about 20,000
Iranian people from the top
ranks in government to
ordinary people by blind
terroristic action of their
mercenaries, economical
sanctions and freezing
most of the external Iranian
assets and an effective and
programmed propaganda
scheme against Iran are
parts of the superpowers
campaigns to abort or at
least stop the widespread
Islamic movements of
about one billion moslems.
In this huge evil
campaign the articles
similar to the one published
in the FELIX no 736 are so
worthless and indignant to
be referred to.
In spite of all
conspiracies made by
superpowers and killing of
their puppets and
mercenaries the message
of the Islamic Revolution
has been received by their
consciences of the
oppressed people of the
world and it will not be too
long that its flames burn
the roots of oppression and
injustice all over the world.
'Some members of the IC
Islamic Society'
Iran
Dear Sir,
I did not really think FELIX
could also became a
propaganda mouth. In your
last issue, (Wed 19.3.86), in
the Opinion column,
someone, who did not even
have the courage to sign
his/her name, managed to
pour out some of the most
incoherent rubbish that I
have read the western
press about Iran. It was
also childish and cowardly
to publish such one-sided
'opinion' in the last issue of
term, so as to delay the
opportunity of an
immediate response.
To answer each and
every one of those fatuous
remarks needs a book and I
hope somebody throws
some light on the other
side of the story in a similar
opinion column. Let me
just say that seven years
ago, the people in Iran
managed to overthrow one
of the mightiest dictators of
our time, the Shah. In
doing this, they received
precious little help or
encouragment from the rest
of the world. They learnt
how sacrifice alone could
bring about concrete
results, and they paid with
their blood in order to
establish a government of
their own-a rule that
brought their culture and
values in to practice since
the capitalist and socialist
doctrines had failed to
provide an acceptable
political solution, they
wished to give their own
idealogy-lslam-a chance.
They did so by an over
whelming majority in a
referendum. But from the
time of the 'crusaders'.
Islam has always had a bad
publicity in the west. Hence
the government in Iran is
always presented in the
'dark ages' mentality, which
Iranian women in purdah
is in fact a reflection of the
subjective attitude of the
western media. If a whole
nation has decided to
practice Islam, who then
are westerners to pass a
judgement? If they want to
fight with immorality in
their society, what right
does the western man have
to criticise them, given the
conditons of his own
society?
In any case, if the people
in Iran felt any type of
renewed oppression, there
is nothing to stop them
revolting again. After all
they defeated a mighty
dictator, and his brutal
secret police seven years
ago, single-handed. This
time they would even get
the combined support of
the CIA and KGB!!
Meanwhile those few who
have preferred the comfort
and luxury of lives in
European capitals and dare
call themselves 'exiled
democrats' are only day-
dreamers. Every nation gets
what it deserves as a ruler,
the brave nation of Iran
certainly does not deserve
such deluded and arrogant
ostriches.
Truly yours
