Size Isn't Everything
The size of human testicles
may be more important than
was previously thought.
Recent studies have shown
that there may be a
relationship between racial
variations in testicle size and
the incidence of dizygotic or
fraternal twins (which develop
when two ova are fertilised at
the same time).
Measuring testicle size is
difficult in living specimens,
and results aren't very reliable;
the weight at death is a more
accurate measure. The large
differences found are rather
surprising: Caucasians have
much bigger testicles than
Asians, and the difference is
quite out of proportion to the

differences in body size.
In apes, large testicle size
correlates with high
copulatory frequency and nigh
probability that a female wMi
mate with several males
during one ovulatory cycle.
But the same does not apply
to humans.
The variation in the
incidence of fraternal twins
follows the same direction as
the variation in testicle size. In
Japan, for instance, about 2
births per thousand result in
fraternal twins. In Caucasians
the figure is more than 8 per
thousand, and in the Yoruba
tribe in llesha it is nearly 50
per thousand. The testicle size
for Yorubas is not recorded.
But so-called causal links
like this need to be treated
with caution. It has been
shown that the concentration
of sulphur dioxide in the
atmosphere is directly
proportional to the rate of
illegitimacy...
The Week In Science
A new feature that looks at what's been happening in Science.
Embryo Auction
The first international embryo
auction was held in Sydney,
Australia this month, with 89
embryos auctioned in 51 lots
by video links throughout
Australia and New Zealand.
GCHQ Lies
The government has
announced that as a security
measure it is going to
introduce polygraph lie-
detector equipment at the
government spy station,
G C H Q Cheltenham. The
British Psychological Society
(BPS) has warned its members
that if they operate the
equipment they will lay
themselves open to
disciplinary action.
Research by American
scientists, published in The
Lancet last month, reported
that the use of the lie detector

Apart from their use in
research, the attraction of
embryos over the newly born

transport from Australia to
New Zealand.
(All the lots were cattle
embryos).
was based on a very weak
scientific foundation . The
polygraph is more likely to
incriminate truthful people
than liars, and is unlikely to
help prove a person's
innocence, they say.
The polygraph was invented
by Sir James Mackenzie, a
London heart specialist who
died in 1925. The device
simultaneously records pulses
in various veins and arteries,
and so identifies disturbances
in the heart beat. Mackenzie
designed it for use in
investigating heart disease,
but it was soon replaced by
the electrocardiograph for that
purpose.
To Drink their answers.
Could the piss artistjn the
Union Bar really be more
artistic than the rest of us?
Probably not, but many
creative genii have also been
drunkards. Take for instance,
Dylan Thomas, Brendan
Behan, W C Fields and
Sibelius. All were creative
people. And all drank
themselves to death. There are
many more examples.
Now there is some scientific
work going on to try to
establish a connection. Geoff
Lowe, of Hull University, took
16 men and 16 women aged
18-30. Each subject came in to
the laboratory on two
occasions a week apart. At
one visit they were given
alcohol and on the other
occasion a control non-
alcoholic drink made to taste
the same. The subjects has no
way of knowing what they
were drinking. On both
occasions they had to
complete a creativity test after
their drink. Typical questions
were 'How many uses can you
think of for a cardboard box?'
and'What if clouds had long
strings attached to them,
hanging down to earth?'
The results do not show a
direct correlation between
alcohol consumption and
creativity. What they do show
is that those who did very well
when sober did worse when
drunk, and thosewho did
badly when sober did a bit
better when drunk.
Lowe believes that the
reason may be as follows: the
low scorers were stressful and
anxious when sober, and
alcohol made them relax a bit;
the high scorers were
performing at their peak when
sober and alcohol numbed
Or Not To Drink
More than 20 people are dead,
and 50 are blind, after drinking
Italian wine laced with
methanol. Nine winemakers
are in prison charged with
murder, and four wineries
have been closed down.
Methanol (CH3 OH) is related
to ordinary alcohol, ethanol
( C H 3 C H 2 O H ) , but it is very
much more toxic.
About 100ml of methanol is
sufficient to kill, and 30ml can
cause permanent blindness.
The contaminated cheap red
Italian wine has sometimes
contained as much as 170ml
methanol per litre bottle,
easily a lethal dose.
What is confusing experts is
why anyone would add such a
toxic substance to wine. The
answer probably lies in the
way in which cheap Italian
wines are priced. The value of
such wines depends on the
alcohol content, which is
determined by measuring
specific gravity or density.
Methanol (density 0.7915g/l)
artificially lowers the density
and so increases the value
when sold to distributors.
One immediate effect of the
scandal has been to reduce
Italy's wine exports to almost
nothing. Which is quite
serious for a country where
exports earn about Â£625
million a year in foreign
currency.
Together with the lethal
nature of methanol, this makes
the problem much graver than
the Austrian scandal last year,
when diethylene glycol was
found in wine. (Diethylene
glycol is not antifreeze, by the
way. Antifreeze is mainly
ethylene glycol.)
Less Than Likely
Probabilities have to be
positive, don't they? The
likelihood of 'tails' is roughly
0.5, and the likelihood of
'heads' is also roughly 0.5 and
if you add'them together you
get exactly 1; which is the
probability of getting an
outcome at all. The idea of a
negative probability would
seem to be outside everyday
human experience. Things are
either certain (1), impossible
(0), or more usually
somewhere in between.
But negative probabilities do
seem to keep cropping up. In
quantum mechanics, for
instance, relativistic
generalisations of classical
quantum theory often yield
negative energies, and with
them, functions that can be
interpreted as being
probability distributions that
are capable of being negative.
In attempting to give some
meaning to negative
probablity, Professor M S
Bartlett, formerly of
Manchester University,
suggests the following
approach. If a coin is biased,
then the probablity of tossing
'heads' can be expressed as
0.5+x. Clearly x can be
positive or negative,
depending on which way the
coin is biased. So here we
have a probability term that
can take a negative value.
And now for our
competiton. Bartlett believes
that most of the problems
posed by negative probability
stem from people's rash
determination to follow Born
in treating the square of the
wave function as a probability
distribution. Bartlett sees no
physical justification for this
assumption. The best
justification submitted by a
reader (less than 300 words
please) will be published next
week. All contributions to the
