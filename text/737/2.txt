Rag Mag
In FELIX No 713 Julian
Rose, a former Editor of the
Aston University
newspaper, described how
an article in his newspaper
that made fun of the
Bradford fire had attracted
amazingly bad publicity for
Aston. He warned that the
Rag Mag would attract
similar bad publicity for
Imperial.
Mr Rose has been proved
right. National newspapers
have carried articles that
done serious damage to
Imperial College's image. .
Tony Spencer, the Rag
Mag Editor, may think its
funny to be have his
publication attacked in the
national press it may, as he
has suggested in the past
increase sales of the Rag
Mag to have it attacked in
The Daily Mirror: it won't
increase applications to
Imperial; it won't improve
our chances of getting a
decent grant next year.
Applications to Imperial
College are dropping
dramatically. If this trend
continues the value placed
on your degree by industry
will be lowered. Publicity
about 'sick' Rag Mags will
only encourage parents to
send their sons and
daughters to 'nice'
universities like Bath and
Exeter rather than 'sick'
ones like Imperial.
Next year your grant is
being cut in real terms
(surprise, surprise). One of
the reasons the
Government can
continually cut grants is
that the public have a very
low opinion of students.
Their opinion will be lower
when the read about the
Rag Mag.
Rag is an important part
of student life. Events like
Rag Fete on Saturday allow
students to enjoy
themselves and raise
money for charity. The Rag
Mag is an important part of
Rag at Imperial College.
Rag Mags should appeal to
the student sense of
humour. They shouldn't
attract bad publicity for the
College. Rag Mags are
primarily mean't to raise
money for charity. This Rag I
Mag wouldn't have worse
sales if the Bradford fire
jokes had been removed.
Union President Carl
Burgess had the
oppurtunity to remove the
Bradford jokes before the
Rag Mag was printed. I
hope Christine Taig learns
by Carl's mistakes.
Iran
In the letters page this
week you will notice
several letters this week
attacking opinion article
about Iran that FELIX
printed last term. I'll leave
you to decide which side is
right or wrong. I'd just like
to defend the anonimous
writer of that article. In the
past Iranian students who
have attacked the regime in
Iran have been beaten on
the campus of their British
university. The author of
that article wasn't keen to
risk being beaten up. They
were brave enough to trust
me not reveal who they are,
though. I hope
anyone who reads this will
agree with me that anyone
who, like this author, risks
being beaten up to express
an opinion is brave.

Barclays Again...
Dear Hugh,
As one of the people
responsible for drafting the
Barclays Bank motion,
which has not yet been
debated at a U G M , I would
like to comment on several
points raised by John
Martin's letter in FELIX 736
I would firstly like to
know what 'far-reaching
reforms' have been
implemented, or proposed
by President Botha in
South Africa. Perhaps Mr
Martin refers to the
introduction of the
coloured and Indian houses
of parliamant set up to
advise the white house on
matters relating to the
coloured and Indian
communities; the election
for which had the support
of less than 18% of the
electorate in each case.
The black community
which accounts for just
over 70% of the population
still had no say whatsover
in the government of South
Africa.Perhaps, instead, he
meant the repeal of the law
banning inter-social sex,
which means that black
and white South Africans
can now marry each other,
although because of the
Group Areas Act, they are
not allowed to live in the
same part of town.
Even'the proposed
abolition of the pass laws,
which prevent black South
Africans from being in any
part of the country unless
they have a stamp to prove
they live or work there,
represents little more than
a political sleight of hand.
The 'orderly urbansations'
system which is due to
replace them will have as
its only stipulation for
urban right the condition
that an individual must
have accommodation. That
condition alone smacks of
the influx control which is
supposedly being
abolished. Apartheid
cannot be reformed,
modernised or streamlined;
it needs to be completely
dismantled.
The only reason that
apartheid has survived for
so long is because of the
massive financial support
for South Africa from the
international community.
Unless this support is cut,
there will be no incentive
for the white community in
South African to mend its
ways. Therefore the best
way that we outside of the
country can oppose
apartheid is to, as Mr
Martin has suggested,
respect the views of Bishop
Desmond Tutu and call for
full mandatory sanctions
against South Africa. One
of the largest British
investors in South Africa
over the years has been
Barclays Bank, which via it
South African subsiduaries
has £6 billion worth of
assets in South Africa and
controls 30% of the
banking there; hence the
reason for the motion to
discourage students from
opening accounts with
them.
Bishop Tutu is not the
only prominent South
African church leader to
call for sanctions; Rev
Beyers Naude, president of
the South African Council
of Churches repeated the
call on national television
only last week
Could Mr Martin please
tell me which African
countries he says have,
after overthrowing
apartheid or foreign
colonial systems, became
less representative and
more brutal? Could he
name one which is the last
year detained over 20,000
people without trial for
speaking out against the
govenment, or one in which
over 1400 people according
to government figures have
lost their lives in the last 18
months!
I would like to ask one
final question. If more of
the members of Con Soc
who had been asked to
come along to the U G M on
13 March had done so, so
that they were in the
majority, and yet the
meeting was still clearly
inquorate, would the
meeting have been
representative enough for
Mr Martin not to have been
prepared to challenge the
quorum, or does
democracy just work in one
direction?

Dear Mr Pavy and Mr James,
My sister-in-law, Phyllis
Breslin, has asked me to
write to you on her behalf.
She greatly appreciated
your thoughtful gesture in
sending a floral tribute to
Neil's funeral. May I
mention that I personally
was particularly attracted
by the unusual multi-
coloured design.
Needless to say, Phyllis
is quite overwhelmed by
the generosity of your
