O
Intelligent Robots?
An opinion article by ex-Guildsheet editor Mark
Cottle.
Towards the end of last term I was involved in the
production of a spoof Guildsheet which had been
intended to satirize various aspects of student unions at
Imperial College. Some people were offended by some of
the contents, I was offended by bits of it myself.
Nevertheless I had become so disillusioned in my time
at college that I felt something needed to be done to
shock people with the sort of hypocisy which goes on. At
the time it was rather difficult to write a serious criticism
openly, but it's no good pouring out derision without
trying to say something positive as well. I've been an
active supporter of things like C C U s and Rag in the past
and so maybe its slightly hypocritical for me to write some
of the following. But looking around me I see the same old
faces having their say.
The word 'hack' is normally used to mean anyone who
is involved with an organisation (often newspapers) at a
basic level, but at Imperial it seems to be an insult. I asked
myself why this is so. Why don't the vast majority of
students seem to care. Why is it that obnoxious extroverts
so often end up running things? Why in an institution that
is supposed to have such a formidable academic record, is
it, that the usual method for showing discontent with your
course is to talk loudly in lectures, lob paper darts or go
to sleep? Seeing as FELIX is open for anybody to air their
opinions and at the risk of being considered an obnoxious
extrovert I decided to have my say.
more space, and you get a
set of reasons why
applicants with good 'A'
levels are beginning to go
elsewhere. In fact whereas
last year for science and
engineering as a whole
throughout the country
U C C A applications fell by
Sometime earlier this
year during a discussion on
teaching at College the
suggestion was made to me
that "IC produces very
good technicians but poor
scientists" Now as a
(supposed) engineer I'm
not really qualified to talk
about teaching on Science
courses, but it seemed that
the point of the comment
was that while Imperial
produces people with a
high standard of
competence in the basic
disciplines of their subject
it fails to teach them to
think for themselves. The
concensus seemed to be
that we are at an institution
which has taken to heart its
brief to produce
technological graduates for
industry at the expense of
teaching you to ever
challenge what you are
told- to ever be anything
but apathetic about the
world beyond your own
immediate life. When I
came to Imperial I did so
because certain points had
been made to me by
prospectuses and staff. I
now find that I'm not the
only one to be disllusioned
by the reality behind some
of these expectations.
Teaching methods and
standards are one area
where a lot has already
been said but little has yet
been done. A college
working party on schools
Mason noted last May that
"There is evidence that IC
has a bad reputation in
undergraduate teaching".
Yet only recently has the
Union been seen to take
any sort of coordinated
interest in academic affairs.
In fact many well
intentioned committees
seem to have acted, as Pete
Klemperer suggested,
merely to keep student
discontent quiet. It needs
about 3%, applications to
IC fell by 8%. More than
that, according to the
College Admissions Policy
Committee, the College
Scholarship exam, an
indicator of high potential
students, will probably not
be run in future due to a
lack of candidates.
Imperial depends on a
more than motions at
inquorate UGMs to have
much influence when
college policy appears to
be dominated by
economics and orientated
towards industrial research.
Then there is the
question of the ratio of
sexes which, to judge by
the pages of FELIX, is
treated in some quarters
with far less than the
seriousness it deserves.
Add to this the worsening
problems of
accommodation, the ability
of many universities
outside London to offer
more modern facilities and
highly qualified and highly
motivated intake to
produce high quality
graduates—it, would have
to given the limitations of
its teaching! Ultimately if
the standard of applications
to IC is seen to fall so will
its reputation and the
reputation of your degree.
There are staff who are
concerned about student
problems, the new rector,
for one, seems keen to
improve matters. But the
unions seem to consistently
let their members down.
Student unions will always
have certain inherent
problems. The officers will
always be amateurs in
comparison to the
professional administrators
they may deal with. There
will always be a lack of
continuity as officers
change each year, those
just taking over will take a
large part of their term of
office to become
experienced. Quite often if
college get an unfavourable
response from one set of
officers all they need to do
is wait for the next set.
Against this Imperial has
had certain strengths,
significantly national party
politics and all its inherent
polarising of debate has
taken a back seat in union
business. But in striving to
maintain a 'vehemently
moderate' image
anachronisms have arisen.
In fact in many respects the
student unions at Imperial
are an extremist farce. It is
my personal disillusion with
some of the people
responsible for
representing students and
the failure (largely) of the
union to contain their
incompetence or self
interest that has really led
me to write this.
The union is currently
facing problems of limited
money and demands on
space. This is not a sudden
problem it is a crisis which
has been brewing slowly
for years. The plan for
excavating gravel at
Harlington was uncovered
at least three years ago, the
need for the Life Science
department to find more
space is not something
which suddenly happened
halfway through this year.
Yet has the union had any
coherent reply to college
plans? It hasn't even
managed to make the full
facts of the proposals
known. This year's
chairman of the Athletics
Clubs Committee was given
virtually no information at
all about the way the
Harlington gravel
development will affect the
number of pitches
destroyed and he is
probably the guy whose
business it is most of all.
Then there is the old
chestnut of C C U finance
and how justifiable some of
the spending is. From the
mirky depths of some
compromising brain came
phrases like 'integral but
autonomous' which mean
'you have to give us money
but we can spend it how
we like'. The point of this is
to show what happens
when an organisation is run
by lots of people who all
want to be in
charge—everyone ends up
looking after their own
