arm.
The bitter disappointment
of defeat was soon
drowned in the bar
afterwards, and a beer
soaked referee belatedly
awarded the spot kick. In
dramatic fashion Whitehead
and the Dutch Keeper
returned to the pitch, only
for IC partly and partially
pissed penaltly King to
place his shot wide. The
British Bulldog was not the
only candidiate for
castration that evening!

As the British media harled
their anger at the Zuilichem
defeat, attacking the
apparent carefree attitude
and slack discipline of the
IC tourists, the captaincy
was taken away from the
laid back Lunghi, and for
this final game was given to
the more belligerent
Bravery.
However, a heavily-
sanded artificial surface,
which resembled, in parts,
the glassy remains of a
road accident, as well as
making IC realise that the
slide tackle ban was not
such a bad idea after all,
also meant that controlled
football was impossible. A
ridiculously light ball
bobbled, bounced and
ballooned all over the
place, the tackles were as
artificial as the pitch, and
within half an hour, the
pantomine had reached 3-
3, Lunghi, Lynne and
Rhodes netting for the
visitors.
Amid an unreal, almost
farcical atmosphere,
Bravery's travelling Circus
plunged to new but
entertaining depths, and
keeper Whitehead thrilled
an open-jawed crowd with
a sensational fifty-yard
dribble up the touchline.
The confident Olympia
outfit, perhaps sensing the
unusual lack of British grit,
on such a gritty pitch,
proceeded to tear IC apart
in the second period with
some marvellously skilful
ball controls and flick inter-
passing. Baffled, bemused
and bewildered, old pros
like Goldsworthy, arrow,
and Barnes were given a
harsh footballing lesson,
and it was more through
luck than judgement,
including a missed penalty,
which kept the score down
to 5-3 infavour of the home
team.
Nevertheless, that
evening as reporters arrived
at the IC hotel for the after
match inquest, it was clear
that many of the squad,
busy with hairdryers,
deodorants, and clean
socks, were far more
concerned with feasting
their eyes on foreign
frauleins than fretting over
failed football fixtures.
As the team returns
home after such poor
results, surely it is time for
us to consider appointing a
tough Ron Saunders type
supremo, to prevent our
sportsmen treating future,
tours as an excuse for
holiday fun and frolics.

Don't forget the Dramatic
Society Auditions for our
shows at the Edinburgh
Fringe Festival in August.
This year we are
performing three plays: The
Rhyme of the Ancient
Mariner, by Samuel
Coleridge-Taylor, the
Woman in White by William
Wilkie Collins and the
Lucky Ones, By Neil
Marchant.
The auditions take place
on Friday 25th April at
7.00pm and on Sunday at
2.00pm.
We need you to act, to
make sets, and for costume
and lights. This is an
excellent opportunity to
become invovled in the
largest theatre and arts
festival in the world. It
doesn't matter if you're not
involved with Dramsoc
Everyone is welcome.
Meet in the storeroom on
level two and half (above
the Union Office) on either
or both of the dates above.
See you there.

Women's Officer
Freebie
After the trauma of exams,
how about a free trip
home? College will pay the
travel expenses of any
female student who's
willing to go back to their
school and talk to other
girls about the
opportunities avialable to
them in science and
engineering and at Imperial
College. If you're
interested, let me know and
I'll give you leaflets to take
with you and an expenses
form to be stamped by your
school.
Election papers go up
soon for next year's
Women's Officer job. You
don't have to be a hack or
an extremist, basically
what's needed is someone
who's interested in welfare
issues and in encouraging
more girls to consider
science and engineering as
a career, it doesn't have to
be desperately time
consuming either. If you're
interested in being
Sci-Fi
Summer
Activities
Contrary to popular beleif,
not all clubs close
completely over the
summer term. S F S O C will
still be holding regular
library meetings on
Thursday lunchtimes, and
we'll be running a stall at
Rag Fete where you'll be
able to see lots of old TV
Science Fiction shows
(including Dr Who, The
Avengers, The Prisoners,
UFO, The Tomorrow
People...)
Plans are also afoot for a
club dinner sometime in
the last 2 weeks of this
term. Cost to be about £10,
with subsidy etc.
depending on numbers and
menu requests. Anyone
interested should give
details to a committee
member at a library
meeting or any other time
you can catch one. Try to
do this as soon as possible
please. A 'pub crawl at the
end of term' is also a
possibility, to have
something to look forward
to after this term's carnage.
Best of luck to everyone!
Women's Officer next year
do get in touch with me, via
the Union office or Mech
