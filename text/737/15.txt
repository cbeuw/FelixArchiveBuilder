I Star wars:
Imperial
is a
target
Academics at British
Universites are being
encouraged to apply for
Star Wars research
projects. Mr George
Gallagher Daggitt of the
Ministry of Defence has
;sent letters to the Vice
Chancellors of every British
University. In the letter he
stated that 'adequate
provisions' had been made
'for the protection of British
'intellectual property rights.
The funding for research,
he said would come from
the Americans Innovative
Science of Technology
programme, which has a
budget of 2.7$billion.
Seventeen areas of
research have been listed
as being applicable to SDI.
A number of items
including composite
materials, parallel high
speed computers, and
lasers are relevant to
Imperial. Applications will
be handled though the
research contracts office,
which will scrutinise any
contracts madeâ€”'no
contracts have been
accepted yet' said Mr
Lobbette from the Research
Contracts Office, 'although
several people have
expressed interest'. The
deadline for applications is
May 3rd.
The Pro-Rector Dr
Phelps was anxious to allay
fears that the publication of
research work would be
restricted by classification.
'There is no way that
college will sign anything
with classification clauses'
he said. He said that
Imperial, would be a
'premier leader in the
competition' and could
hope to gain 'an upper
target of $20 million' from
Star Wars research.
Mr Gallagher-Daggit told
FELIX that work on the
Innovative Science and
Technology program would
not be classified. He said
that assurance to this effect
had been made in congress
by General Yonas the
Deputy Director of the SDI
organisation. He refused to
elaborate on the details of
what Mr Yonas said as the
details were apparently
classified.
'Any authority which
awards grants from Science
and Engineering research
places an obligation on
researchers to publish
results', said Mr Gallagher
Daggitt.
He was unable to say
how much money British
Universities would receive
but warned 'any ideas that
there will be millions of
pounds coming over are
crazy'. He went on to say
that Britain would face
strong competition from
the USA, Germany, France
and Israel.
A source in the American
Embassy told FELIX that
the financial rewards for
Universities were likely to
be small during the first
years. He said that
'upwards of 10 or 12'
contracts were under
negotiation including one
university, Heriott-Watt (for
their work on optical
computers). He felt the
classification would occur
on a case by case basis in
both industry of
universities. Mr Tarn Dalyell
is looking into this matter
in the House of Commons.
A full report will be given in
next week FELIX.
Changes at
the UGC
The University Grants
Committee has adopted a
new funding policy for the
1986/87 session. It is
rumoured that there will be
shocks for some
universities which have
been well-funded in the
Jvpast.
The changes are the
result of a report to the
U G C by management
consultant Roger McCure,
who received the plans of
all British Universities with
the help of U G C Staff. Mr
McCure concluded that the
university system is near to
collapse, with several
institutions facing
insolvency. Although
income could be increased
by recruiting more overseas
students and attracting
more research money, he
was concerned that this
would not make a
significant difference. All
Universities compete for
the same pool of overseas
students, and research
grants are determined by
the Government. However,
the report recognised the
differing plans of each
university, some of which
had taken the worse
possible choices.
The U G C hopes that
some institutions will be
capable of support, but
they will have to decide
whether to continue
funding particular
universities on their costs.
Only 17% of students
would vote Conservative in
an immediate General
Election according to a
Marplan pole for NUS. This
is compared with a claimed
student vote for the
Conservatives of 42% in the
1983 General Election. The
survey gave Labour the
I lead with 35%. The Alliance
I were second with 27%.
'Vicky Phillips of the
National Organisation of
Labour Students was
elected NUS President at
the recent NUS Annual
Conference.
R C S Rugby team won the
Sport's Cup C C U rugby
teams 1st XVs at the end of

RCS won the Sports Day
on Wednesday. They
scored 215 points beating
RSM who scored 203 point
and Guilds who scored 158
points.
Thirty competitors took
part in the event. Sports
Day organiser John Pope
described the event as
'great fun'.
Physics student Gavin
Waterson came 132nd in
the London Marathon with
a personal best time of 2hrs
26 minutes 45 seconds.
Prof Frank Leppington has
been appointed head of the
Department of
Mathematics. He has been
appointed to the post for
five years. He will take
office on the 1st
September.
Computing student John
Pope has been elected
President of University of
London Union Sports
Council. He will represent
the University of London
' Sports Club on the ULU
Executive.
The FELIX Office is likely
to move to the old kitchens
behind the Lounge. College
has hired an architect to
work with FELIX to draw up
plans for the new Office. In
addition the College has
offered to purchase new
equipment for FELIX to
compensate it for damage
to existing equipment
caused by the move. FELIX
have still to respond to the
College offer.
Two senior academics from
Imperial College were
elected to Fellowship of the
Royal Society on 20th
March. They are Prof R M
Anderson, Professor of
Parasite Ecology and head
of the Life Sciences
Department and Prof J
Argyris, Emeritus Fellow of
Aeronautical Structures at
IC.
