The site of the new hall in South Ealing which will provide 405 new
student places. Originally required to be available for some students
from the beginning of October, the first residents will now be mov-
ing in at the end of this year.
A new development, situated in South Ealing, has been bought by Imperial. At a cost I
of around SI 1 Million in total the site will eventually provide 405 student places that are
much needed. Funding for the enterprise will come from the sale of Montpellier Hall.
It is expected that this sale will raise between &7M and S10M at current market values.
The finance deal has yet to be finalised but will involve an effective cash and either mor- UPji
tgage or lease back arrangement. The funds from the sale of Montpellier are also intended JffV
to allow money to be used for 'planned improvements and additions to other College
property.'. The sale of Montpellier Hall means the loss of dedicated accomadation /'•J**.'
for Postgraduates. Plans to re-house them in the Old Hostel, Beit, have met with jtfr£*.i?>
concerns from within Sherfield. The worry is about the reaction of Postgraduates to
the new, less adequate accomadation represented by Beit. Also there is a pro-
blem from noise coming from the Union Building, particularly during term time.
The deal comes at a time when the cost of local accomadation available tO/t
students is escalating beyond their means. Especially with the loss of benefits
with the introduction of the Poll Tax. A number of the leases on other col-
lege residences are also coming up for renewal and it is unlikely that the
College will be able to afford new leases, even if the options are available.
