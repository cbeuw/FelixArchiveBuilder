READING
"Before we meet tomorrow, you should read these few references." An enormous list of journals, dates and
pages appears on the blackboard. You know damn well there won't be enough time to read them all as well as
write up that lab report for tomorrow, but\joumight do it at the weekend...
T
he purpose of this feature is to
help with such problems and
perhaps to provide benefits in
other situations. Having seen the
title, vou already know what the
subject is - speed reading.
An improvement in reading speed
provides many advantages,
including the obvious attraction of
being able to complete some course-
work in record time. It could also
mean being able to read one or more
dailv papers, as well as monthly
journals and novels.
One benefit, perhaps unexpected,
is that faster reading can lead to
increased comprehension. Everyone
is. no doubt, familiar with the
following rather embarrassing
situation:
Having almost finished a practical
write-up, you find that you
desperately need to read through an
article in a past 'Xature.' You dash
off to the library, find the required
article, and start plodding through
it, bored out of vour skull.
Eventually you come to the end and
stop, trying to remember anything
about what you've just read.
Xothing comes to mind. What a
waste of time! Oh well, back to the
beginning...
This situation wouldn't arise if
reading automatically meant
comprehension of a text.
Unfortunately it doesn't. And slow
reading is more likely to lead to
boredom than faster reading, which
in turn, is more likely to lead to lack
of concentration with corresponding
lack of comprehension. Hence, by
increasing reading speed, not only
is text covered quicker, but
comprehension is also enhanced.
In the following article. 1 hope to
outline some of the causes of slow
reading and also to present some
suggestions that could improve your
reading speed considerably.
Anvway, enough of why vou
should read this feature, and on
with the Show':1

worth the work. The first thing to
do is to cast vour attention to the
bookshelf. See a dictionary? If not,
then vou might consider buying
one. For the rest of this discussion,
it is assumed that vou do have easy
access to one. A thesaurus is
perhaps less useful to the reader,
"Using these techniques, and
after some practice you may find
your reading speed increases
400% or more"
VOCABULARY
A
limited vocabulary, although
a problem in itself, can lead to
other difficulties detailed
below. Unable to understand fully
some word or phrase, our natural
reaction is to stop, think, and re-
read the offending section. This
tendency to back-skip and re-read
text is, as explained below,
symptomatic of deeper problems
regarding poor eye movements
while reading. Improving your
vocabulary will, then, cure many
problems at once.
The small effort required to
improve your vocabulary may seem,
daunting, but the results are well
but is invaluable to anyone wanting
to write.
Tried and tested methods for
expanding vocabulary include
attempting to introduce a new word
daily into conversation. Despite
sounding good in theory, this idea
is not so practical for the average IC
student; it might be useful to know
the meaning of 'sarcophagus', but
to use it in a quantum mechanics
tutorial may prove to be a little
tricky...
Rather more practical is the idea
of referring to the dictionary upon
encountering an unfamiliar term
while reading. Note that the most
beneficial way to do this is to skip
the unknown word on a first
reading, then look it up at the end
to avoid interruption. [Tie word is
then referred to in the context of the
original text, hopefully fixing its
meaning firmly in the mind.
Probably the improvement
method of greatest return is one that
can not be fully covered here: it
involves learning lists ot pre suffixes
found in many 'speed reading' or
'vocabulary training' books. Such
lists, once learnt, allow immediate
comprehension of words built from
a root with attached prefix or suffix.
FcÂ»r example:
cxlm- mean* outside or Ivuoud
term from the Latin means earth
So extraterrestrial (ET come
home!) means 'occurring beyond
the earth'
Also apparent from this example
is that the Latin vou may have,
unwillingly studied during
secondary education is actually
useful. In fact, lists ot common Latin
or Greek roots are often presented
alongside the lists of pre/suffixes.
EYE MOVEMENTS
N
ow onto some of the
mechanics of reading, and in
particular the eye movements
taken when reading a piece of text.
Surprisingly, the eye only sees
properly when actually fixed on an
object, and so when reading, your
eyes jump along lines of text in a
series of small hops. Although it
mav feel as if they are moving
smoothly across the page, this is not
the case.
The situation is further
complicated by the backward leaps
