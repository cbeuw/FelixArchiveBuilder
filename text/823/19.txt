As AUT Action Continues
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) have started a
nationwide boycott of student
examinations after its salary
negotiating body, the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP), refused to make a pay offer
last April for 1988.
The AUT claims that the salaries
of its members have fallen by over
20% in real terms over the last
decade. This will lead to increasing
problems in retaining, recruiting
and motivating high-calibre
academic staff, they say. A
spokesman for the AUT told FELIX,
"students of the year 2000 will be
getting a much poorer deal."
In reply, the CVCP withdrew
from negotiating a salary increase on
9th December 1988 and has now
told Vice-Chancellors throughout
final results of their action are still
uncertain.
The 23rd Report
In 1986 the AUT and the CVCP
agreed a pay package which both
sides agree was designed to bring
academic and related staff's salaries
in line with those in the private
sector. The '23rd Report', as it is
known, agreed a pay rise of 16% on
the 1st December 1986 and an
increase of 7
% on the 1st March
1988.
The CVCP claims that this
package covers pay rises up to and
including 1988/89. A spokesman for
the CVCP told FELIX that it was
agreed in 1986 that there would be
no pay rise in 1988/89. The AUT
refutes this, saying that the 23rd
report also contains a section which
The Rector has expressed his disapproval
of the AUTs action in a letter to
the Times on 7th December
the country that they may take
action against staff who take part in
the dispute in one of three ways:
they may deduct staff's wages;
summarily dismiss them; or send
them home without pay, since AUT
members taking part in the action
will be in breach of their contracts.
Last Friday an informal meeting
between the CVCP and the AUT
considered a 3% rise for 1988. This
was later dismissed by a formal
meeting of the CVCP which it felt
that any offer would be so small that
it would only inflame the situation.
The CVCP claims that there is
simply not enough money to give a
pav rise for 1988. A spokesman for
the CVCP told FELIX that, "there
never was any question" of a pay
rise for 1988-89.
Students at Imperial College are
likely to be affected by the dispute.
Specifically, AUT members in the
departments of Computing,
Biochemistry and Civil Engineering
have agreed to participate in the
boycotting of exams although the
recognises that a further pay
increase should be necessary in
1988/89, although the report makes
no financial provision for it.
Having fulfilled the financial
requirements of the 23rd report, the
CVCP is currently holding informal
meetings with the Department of
Education and Science (DES)
regarding pay rises for 1989/90.
The Action at Imperial
The Rector has expressed his
disapproval of the AUT's action in
a letter to the Times on 7th
December. Signed by several Vice-
Chancellors, the letter ends by
saying, "we cannot, in conscience,
support such action and would
tppeal to all our colleagues to
honour their contracts and their
obligations." A letter following this
pointed out that Professor Ash had
not suggested any alternative form
of action to an exam boycott in his
letter.
In a brief survey of the
departments by FELIX, many heads
of departments reported that
student examinations would not be
affected by the action. Union
members gave a different view in
some cases.
The head of the Civil Engineering
Department asked his policy
advisory committee to decide
whether exams could be held at the
beginning of this ter:-n. The
committee, on which the A JT is not
officially represented, concluded
that it would be detrimental to the
students if exams were dehyed. At
the end of last term the Head of
Department informed th,rd year
students whose exams were
scheduled for earlier this week, that
exams would go ahead as planned.
When the AUT asked the Head to
delay the exams at the beginning of
this term, he informed them that he
felt it would be unfair on students
since he had already told them that
exams would go ahead. The AUT
members in the Civil Engineering
Department have indicated that
although the exams have taken
place, they may not be marked.
In the Biochemistry Department,
a secret ballot has indicated that the
action has widespread support.
Students on one course have been
warned that although examinations
will be set, they will not take place
or be marked. An AUT member
from the Biochemistry Department
told FELIX that a number of
departments had not held secret
ballots but had held a simple head
count by the Head of Department.
He complained that this was
unreasonable since Heads of
Departments "decide who gets
promoted and who gets blocked."
The Computing Department has
also balloted its members, and an
AUT member told FELIX that action
would be likely.
Other departments, including
Physics, Electrical Engineering and
Pure and Applied Biology told
FELIX that they did not envisage
any effects. Many departments,
however, were reluctant to discuss
the action.
Nice Mr

Students'

It is estimated that over £3,300
worth of trays have 'gone missing'
from College Refectories recently.
Refectories Manager, Mr Rob
Northey was unable to explain the
loss. 'If I knew where they were
going,' he said, 'I would be
retrieving them.'
He estimates that over 1,000
pieces of cutlery have met with a
similar fate this term, and told
FELIX, 'at the beginning of term we
stock up all the student rooms.'

Finally...
The prestigious Charles Brereton
Memorial Handicap singles snooker
tournament has been won this year
by Pravat Bhattachayya.
In a tense final, Mr Bhattachayya
snatched the £30 prize from his
opponent, Brian Kerr on the last ball
of the frame.
The winner was presented with a
six inch wood and plastic trophy by
the late Mr Brereton (R.I.P) who
then dragged him into the FELIX
office for an interview.
The shy and overawed winner sat
cowering whilst Mr Brereton
repeatedly insisted that he be
interviewed.
Mr Bhattachayya eventually
commented 'Look at this trophy. I
mean - well I'm overawed.' Then
refusing all offers of hospitality the
winner departed adding T should
have been in lab three quarters of an
hour ago..'
