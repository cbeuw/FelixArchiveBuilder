The
Dressmaker
British fims are as good as any in
the world. At least the good ones
are. It VOU have any doubt, this
should change your mind.
The Dressmaker takes us back to
the end of the war. The people of
Liverpool are still suffering the
oppression of rationing and
wartime regulations. As such they
live in the shadow of the affluent
American GI's though with small
worn- of impending doom as was
felt in earlier times.
The title role is taken by loan
Plowright. She represents all that
is the moral and stern remnants
of Victorian England, in the form
of Nellie.
Cohabitant in their two-up-two-
down terraced house is Margo
(Billie Whitelaw), Nellie's sister.
She is an amorous middle-aged
woman with all the bounce and
modernity of a Glenn Miller tune.
Rita (lane Horrocks) is their 17
year-old niece. While desperately
attempting to grow up she
remains a product of her aunts
upbringing. Relentlessly she
approaches a rendezvous with
the pitfalls of adolescence.
Together the three form a
contented family. Only a
contrasting view of men can
separate Nellie and Margo. Rita
maintains a confused stance in
between.
Opportunity to resolve her
bewilderment arrives when
Wesley, a GI appears. Love rears
its ugly head. As the relationship
develops, yet refuses to blossom,
the conflict of opinion threatens
to disrupt the family ever further.
The storv is not complex in any
way. Written in 1973 it earned
authoress Beryl Bainbridge a
Booker Prize nomination. The
world in which this tale is set is
simple and identifiable,
populated by easily recognisable
characters. The cast are accessible
to all but the most blinkered of
audiences.
Quickly draw n into their lives
we are obliged to remain, to
observe the full extent of Wesley's
intrusion, the path is sorrowful
but fortunately one scattered with
much humour.
The exploration of feelings and
accompanying perplexity of
hopes and fears inherent in a first
love is a theme to which we can
all relate. The protection felt and
dependence built are often
misleading. We can see where it
is all heading and sympathise
fully with Rita, who can't.
The Dressmaker is an engaging
piece of cinema. There is possibly
not enough feel for the city itself
but otherwise the film is largely
flawless. This is an ideal way to
rekindle a few fond teenage
memories, and a fairly
entertaining way of passing an
evening.

The Making of
the Represen-
tative for Planet
8
Philip Glass
Doris Lessing
Whilst opera can encompass
many subjects and musical styles
it generally includes singing and
some dramatic action to keep us
entertained. Planet 8 has virtually
no action, a trek through an ice-
field is hardly rivetting stuff, and
no one really sings a song as such.
Instead the dialogue is spoken
and the chorus intone melodically
or otherwise 'to add to the
musical atmosphere' or so it says
in the notes.
Philip Glass, for those who
have never come across him is a
minimalist, and his music
involves three or four note
arpeggios repeated incessantly
until the third flautist makes a
mistake and the rest of the
orchestra follow him into a
different arpeggio. Hence the
music 'progresses'. It is hypnotic,
atmospheric and at times
distinctly tedious, even if you like
this sort of thing. Thus Planet 8
has fewer tunes than your
average Lloyd Webber fart, but
we get recurring themes which
made me wonder if I was
watching one three act opera or
a one act opera three times.
Doris Lessing is an authoress
who writes 'consistently refusing
to accept restrictions on her
subject matter'. To be unkind she
is a communist, feminist, science
fiction writer and in Planet 8 she
used all these traits to the full.
The plot to Planet 8 is simple.
Paradise planet suddenly gets
cold and everyone dies except one
(The Representative). There is a
wall, a guardian from another
planet and a wicked glacier which
Bartholemew
Fair
A 3'A hour play may seem
excessively long to some; a recipe
for boredom perhaps. However,
the National Theatre's production
of Bartholomew Fair never flags for
an instant. At least vou get vour
money's worth! Dont miss it.
Originally written in 1614, the
play has been transposed to
Victorian England. Bartholomew
Fair was a festival celebrated
annually since 11 13, when Henry
1 gave a grant to hold it. In the
play, the enormous cast (over 50
people) dance around,the stage in
a sometimes bewildering array of
vulgar and outrageous scenes.
Two respectable married women
become whores (one of whom is
pregnant); a widow is determined
to marry a madman; a clergyman
in pink women's underwear
shares the stocks with an
undercover judge; greasy Ursula
(Mark Addv), the pig woman of
outrageous proportions flounders
about on stage; the culmination
comes with an \-rated puppet
show .
The whole cast performs so well
that it is impossible to pick out
any one actor from the rest for
their performance. Possibly the
star performer is the stage itself:
ingenious, versatile and colourful,
William Dudley's multi-faceted
set creates a turbulent fairground
atmosphere. A different backdrop
tti each scene was produced so
fluidlv so as not to divert from the
motion of the play.
This production is staged at the
National Theatre, South Bank
Centre. Performance dates vary,
the Box Office telephone number
is 01-928 2252. Prices vary from
student standby at £5 to £14.

rolls around the stage like a
demented Python creation,
gobbling up the natives. The
lighting is atmospheric (must stop
using that word) but three hours
of subdued ice-bound effects is
monotonous and 1 came out
longing for sunshine.
This controversial opera has
much to recommend it. There are
two intervals and the ice cream is
very nice. It has now finished its
inaugural run in London but
despite universal critical approval,
sold out swiftly and is bound to
surface again at a later date. An
experience, even if only for the
killer glacier.
