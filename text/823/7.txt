Travel
BOOKS
The inter-railer's bible is "Europe by
Train" by Katie Wood and George
McDonald, which seems to be
updated every year in March. The
book covers every country in
Europe with short notes on what to
see and all the information a budget
traveller might want. Books on
individual countries might also be
a good idea, and phrase books for
those wishing to converse with the
natives.
A good rail timetable is invaluable;
it is surprising what weird and
wonderful routes can be discovered
in one of these. It is also possible to
save considerable time being able to
plan ahead, rather than turning up
at a station and hoping for a train.
Manv countries in Europe do not
run services between major cities
that are as frequent as British Rail's
services. British Rail publishes a
European Timetable which is cheap,
but only covers direct journeys from
London. The best choice is the
Thomas Cook European Timetable
that is published every month; it is
available from Thomas Cook shops
at £4.95, and a rail map of Europe
will cost £3.15.
ACCOMMODATION
Cheap accommodation can be hard
to find in Europe, especially in the
height of summer. The cheapest
option is camping, but you have to
carry a tent etc around with you all
holiday. Most cities have campsites
on the outskirts; be careful, some
countries insist that one stays in
official campsites only. Next on the
price scale come Youth Hostels.
Europe is littered with them; all you
have to do is join the YHA in this
country and attach a photo to your
card. A book detailing all the youth
hostels in Europe is available from
the YHA. However, the rather strict
rules may put many people off
Youth Hostels; the further south
you get, the more lax the rules.
Another alternative in Southern
Europe is the ension, a small, family
run hotel that can sometimes be as
cheap as a Youth Hostel. Apart from
that, cheap hotels are the only
alternative, and prices begin to get
steep at this point.
...AND
Don't take too much luggage - you
always end up with clothes you
don't need. Also, remember that
vou will want to bring back
presents, booze etc. from Europe, so
leave room in your bag for these
things. It is easy to buy detergent to
wash clothes, and many youth
hostels and campsites will have
facilities to wash clothes.
An ISIC card is useful for
reductions in museums and on
coaches. The tourist agencies of the
European countries in London will
be only too happy to load you down
with piles of pretty leaflets full of
photos of their country, and, more
importa itlv, maps of the major
cities. And remember, enjoy
yourself!
TO ISTANBUL BY THE
SIMPLON ORIENT
Day 1: Boarded the Dover to Calais
ferry at midnight to make the best
use of the month inter-railing. From
Calais, took the 5am train to Paris,
grabbing a few hours of sleep. Spent
the day in Paris, climbing the Eiffel
tower and checking out the Louvre.
In the evening boarded the Simplon
Orient for Venice, camembert and
wine in hand, and stretched out on
the seats for the night.
Day 2 : Woken at 4am by a family
of Italians going on hoilday, the
whole family left little room in the
compartment for us. A day trip to
Venice was abandoned when we
missed the station, so carried on to
joined us.
Day 4 : At 4am Salonica station is
not pleasant. Rescued my
companion from the tracks - he had
decided to sleep there. Boarded the
train for Istanbul at 9am, and
crashed out. Woke at noon to find
my companion had started a party
with the remains of the Ouso. Spent
the day sandwiched between
smoking Greek peasants, reaching
the border in the evening. There the
The Acropolis, Athens.
Trieste to spend the day on the
beach. On the train again in the
evening and into Yugoslavia, where
they took the train apart at the
border.
Dav 3 : Arrived in Belgrade around
lunchtime - Belgrade doesn't have
much to recommend it except the
Slimovitch. Carried on to the Greek
border, where a bottle of Ouso
train left the carriage in the middle
of nowhere for three hours while
the border guards collected the
: passports and then held a lottery
with them. Shunted across the
border, where the Turkish border
guards played the same game.
Day 5 : Continued to Istanbul at a
snail's pace, arriving at 8am to
sample the Orient.
