your eyes make when back
skipping. This activity can be either
conscious or unconscious; in both
cases your eyes move backwards
through text to continue reading
from a point 'upstream' of the
current reading position. Clearly
this action is asteful, and, as
explained below, it is also
unnecessary most of the time.
The typical eye movements of a
normal reader are shown in Fig. 1.
This diagram shows the small leaps
taken across lines of text with the
superimposed back-skipping
movements, the length of which
may vary from one word to a
sentence to an entire paragraph.
The first obvious step in
improvement of eye movements is
to increase the length of the basic
eye-jumps. Initially, this must be
done consciously by forcing yourself
to jump over a group of words,
pausing, and then taking another
leap. This action is shown in Fig. 2.
Clearly, in taking such long leaps
over the text, you are relying on
peripheral vision, that is, the ability
to see outside the optimum field of
vision. When the eye is fixed on a
word, you can see, and recognise
words on either side of the point of
focus. Fast reading exploits this
ability; advanced speed-readers can
move their focus down multiple
lines of type when reading a
newspaper column, and still fully
comprehend what they are reading.
Probably the greatest hurdle to
overcome when initially trying out
this lengthening of your eye-jumps
is the fear that you are not
understanding the text. At first,
your leaps should be relatively
small; larger jumps come with
practice. As far as understanding
the text is concerned, don't worry,
you probably comprehend more
than you may consciously think.
After some practice, this new
method of reading will become
second nature, and should provide
the first positive signs of an ability
to read quickly. Gradually, the
length of the jumps taken can be
increased and the time spent
pausing between leaps can be

and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled...
iecreased. Combined with the
elimination of back-skipping, these
techniques can lead to considerable
speed increases.
BACK-SKIPPING
C
onscious back-skipping can be
avoided quite easily; even if
you think you haven't
followed the author's argument
over the last
phrase/sentence/paragraph, DO
NOT skip back to re-read it. You
have probably understood the
section fairly well - at least well
enough to continue reading without
having lost the thread. Studies have
been made on this point with the
result that people who allow
themselves to backskip do not
perform appreciably better than
non-backskippers in comprehension
tests.
Unconscious backskipping, by its
very nature, cannot be directly
stopped. To eliminate this habit,
reading speed must be increased to
the point where there is no time for
the eyes to wander round the page.
SUBVOCALISATION
S
ubvocalisation - 'speaking' the
text to yourself - derives from
the method used to teach
reading to infants. In primary
school, we are taught first to 'read
out loud', and then, when we get
a little bit older, we are told to 'read
quietly to ourselves.' At this stage,
the action of speaking may be
performed by the mind, with the
mouth still moving to form sounds.
Gradually the habit becomes
subconscious, though it usually
remains into adulthood.
The habit of speaking text in your
mind can slow down reading, but
it is thought that it can never be
completely dispelled - only pushed
further into the subconscious. The
further back it is pushed, the less
intrusive it becomes, and so the
faster reading can be performed.
SKIMMING
S
kimming means quickly
looking over a text to grasp the
general concepts being put
across. The related action of
scanning is looking over text in
order to find a particular point, or,
in the case of many research papers,
to find the end of the waffly
introduction and the start of the
important section.
By skimming a text, as explained
below under 'previewing', you
automatically gain some
understanding, so that reading can
proceed relatively quickly. Some
authorities even recommend flicking
through an entire book, eye fixed on
the middle of the pages as they fly
past, in order to be able to read it
more quickly! (Dunno whether I
believe that 'un guv.) Certainly,
previewing a text is well worth the
effort.
PARAGRAPHS
P
aragraphs are, in a well written
piece, assembled with a well-
defined structure. The first
sentence usually summarises the
rest of the paragraph or gives the
next topic of discussion. An
expansion of this topicfollows, with
the final sentence sometimes linking
into the next topic to carry the
reader through the text.
Within the overall structure of a
text, the first and last paragraphs are
by Steve Meyfroidt
usually the most important; the first
giving a summary and the last a
conclusion. However, the first 'real'
paragraph may not be the first
paragraph of a piece if the author
feels the need to begin with a
helping of waffle. Magazine or
newspaper articles such as this are
usually split into smaller paragraphs
than those found in books. In this
case, it may be the first three or four
paragraphs that give a summary of
the text.
PREVIEWING
P
reviewing a text, that is getting
a basic understanding of the
ideas to be presented, relies
heavily on the writer's skill. First,
the title and any subtitles should be
read to get a feel for the overall
structure. The first paragraph is
then read, followed by the first
sentences of other paragraphs. At
this stage, you know the author's
main points and are almost ready to
begin a first reading. First though,
quickly skim the whole text, and
then start reading from the
beginning.
With practice, the whole
procedure will take less time, and
lead to greater comprehension, than
simply ploughing your way through
the text from start to finish.
CONCLUSION
U
sing the above techniques,
and after some practice, you
may find your reading speed
increases by 400% or more. The
important point to bear in mind is
that there is no miracle cure -
practice is necessary, and the more
you practice, the faster you will
become.
