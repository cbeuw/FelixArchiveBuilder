Theta with two playmates
follow in order to secure the return
of their mascots. In the end, over
£1,100 was raised for Great Ormond
Street Hospital and both R C S and
C & G went away happv. Perhaps
the most famous theft of mascots
was perpetrated on S&B in 1976. A n
RCS man arrived in college to do
Phvsics exactly at the same time as
a Guildsman failed to arrive to study
C h e m i c a l Engineering. Bv
coincidence thev had the same
name—Martin Watson. The R C S
Martin Watson was prevailed upon
to go to C & G lectures, hang around
in their Office, go on their Rag
stunts and generally pretend to be
the C & G Martin Watson (who
wasn't around to clarify matters).
After a term of doing this, he was
entrusted with the task of being a
link in the car chain that was
bringing the mascots into College.
RCS hired him a car, he sat at the
rendezvous, C & G delivered the
mascots to him for transport to the
next rendezvous and he turned S&B
over to a waiting RCS van instead.
It was so subtlev done that it was
quite a time before C & G realised
their mascots were actually missing.
That was the first time that S&B had
been taken together.
Jezebel, Boanerges and Clementine
These are the motorised mascots of
the R C S , C & G a n d R S M
respectively. Though Jez has been
stolen by U C L students before now,
and Bo has had his headlights
nicked in the past, thev are not
violate (ie legitimate targets) and
anyone who threatens to do them
damage usually gets subjected to
hours of torture with fire axes, larger
hammers and rock cutting lasers.
They are far too valuable to be
mucked about with and are a credit
to the dedication of the people who
look after them.
university education, rather than on
the education of life. Old traditions
such as the Morphy Day battle,
throwing people in the Round
Pond, painting zebra crossings
across Prince Consort Road etc are
fading into the background to make
way for problem sheets, lab reports
and a swift half down in Southside
at 10pm. Few, if any, other colleges
engage in mascotry and the few that
do (primarily medical schools) don't
have any organised rules.
H o w e v e r , there's a latent
tendancy tor nicking things in most
students, whether it's signs, glasses
from pubs, street furniture or food
from fridges. Although mascotry
comes in for quite a panning from
the general student body ('I'm not
standing up for some scrappy lump
of metal, it's so childish'), if it's
done properly, cleverly a n d
achieves its aim—raising money for
charity—then it's as valid as any
other club.
There's a mythology that has
grown up around this activity and
many apocryphal stories are to be
had. For instance, did you know
that R S M once stole Chelsea
College's Anchor by blowing it out
of the wall of their College with
gelignite? D i d you also know that
they then buried the anchor in the
King's Road? Has Mike really got
' Q M C 1969' engraved on his shaft?
Is Spanner M k l actually on the roof
of K Q C ' s Union Building? H o w
many times has Theta been stored
in the tunnels beneath 1C? Is Davey
kept in Kensington Palace? Is Mike
really hidden at the top of the
Queen's Tower (as K Q C believe)?
For every embellished story, there
are two real ones which are much
more fun.
Guilds and Mines once kept the
entire population of RCS barricaded
into Chemistry for two days,
removing the trousers of anyone
caught using the tunnels to escape.
During a dispute with Chelsea
and Q M C one year, it was decided
to teach these lesser colleges not to
mess with IC. Posing as a Chelsea
student, a chap ran up Q M C and
told them of a planned raid on IC
the following W e d n e s d a y
lunchtime. Q M C agreed to help in
the raid (of custard pies etc) and a
meeting place was arranged. Then
Chelsea were contacted and told the
same story by the same chap posing
as a Q M C student. C o m e
Wednesday, and the two raiding
parties were met and led to Beit
Quad. Once inside, their contacts
vanished, the gates were locked and
hordes of students, rugby teams etc
etc appeared armed with fire hoses,
buckets of refectory slops and used
oil. The ensuing battle resulted in
the trouncing of Q M C a n d
Chelsea—College Security Chief
Geoff Reeves was called, he took
one look through the locked gates
of Beit Quad, pronounced that he
hadn't seen a thing and left again.
Q M C and Chelsea spent the next
few weeks accusing each other of
setting the other up.
T h o u g h this isn't strictly
mascotrv, it's along the same lines.
By and large, mascotry looks after
itself. A l l attempts to formalise the
rules, impose penalities and curb
the somewhat chaotic nature of
activities have met with limited
success. Guilds and RCS accept the
spirit of the game (evident from the
pleasant nature of the S&B Treasure
Hunt recently) and very rarely do
things get out of hand. Mines are a
slightly different bucket of
haddock—they don't care about
much, except maintaining their own
identity and 'fair enough' to that.
However, you've got to be a bit
careful as regards Davey. N o use
trying to take it bv force, or
overwhelming numbers because
they're of the opinion that baseball
bats arc legitimate mascotry tools.
The almost complete destruction of
Maths Lecture Theatre 213 several
years ago resulted from a small R S M
contingent requesting the return of
their mascot in their own inimitable
fashion! To get a hold of Davev you
need either a daft mistake on their
part, unbelievably sussed plans or
a small thermonuclear device. The
last of these is an impracticalitv, the
second is down to you and the first
is just a matter of time.
When it comes to the crunch,
Imperial is a unique place. We have
unique traditions, a unique union
structure and a uniquely eccentric
air that sets us apart from the
predominantly militant rest of the
University environment. A s the
Sunday Times put it in its review of
Universities a couple of vears ago:
'Imperial is conservative,
chauvinistic and boozv (Ladies
Rugby!!)'
Mascotry may get a bad press at
times, perhaps people feel that
traditions are stupid and we should
be concentrating on survival, but to
destroy a society vou first have to
remove its identity and while such
quaint pastimes as, for instance,
cherishing some lumps of metal
(where the penalty for not doing it
properly is the generation of funds
for a childrens' hospital) continue to
be championed then I submit that
we will live through the worst
excesses of any government and
outlast all those others who are
frantically sacrificing their principles
just to stay alive.
