The Mantle Twins are
inseparable. Elliot and Beverly are
their names. From the off they
take identical paths to
gynaecology practise, starting at
an early age with grisly toy
operating equipment, continuing
through medical school,
culminating in a joint specialist
surgery in Toronto.
Bev has always been the
studious type. Elly is rither more
flamboyant. They pi ' a eame of
deception as onlv identical twins
could, each using his own
charisma and persona to achieve
what both want. Together they
form one complete entity.
French-Canadian actress Claire
Biveau stumbles into their lives.
'Tell me about my uterus' she
demands over dinner, and so
begins a love tangle destined to
disrupt the happy existence the
brothers have.
Beverly falls in love. The
woman provides and irresistable
comfort despite, or perhaps
because of, her extraordinary mix
of strangeness (T need to be
spanked. I'm bad'). It is solace
away from Elly though and thus
the wedge is driven in.
For the first time in their lives
M o o n w a l k e r
The magic of the cinema and the
magic of Michael Jackson combine
to blast the movie audiences of
the world with a musical and
visual feast, interlaced with
enough supreme acting to collect
every Oscar imaginable and one
or two you've probably forgotten
all about.
Well...that constitutes
something of an exaggeration. It
would be more accurate perhaps
to say that Moonwalker is a string
of videos vaguely attached to each
other by a bemusing storyline of
stupifying simplicity.
Sit back and enjoy the journey
into Michael's mind. By all means
tap your foot to the boogie-
woogie tunes but don't ignore the
point (points, there are several) of
this film.
An opening sequence of video
clips imparts a retrospective of the
musical life which we know so
well already. The first lesson we
are presented with is that Michael
a separation occurs. The anger,
confusion and madness which
ensues slowly tears them apart.
The twins are played by Jeremy
Irons (The Mission, Brideshead
Revisited). He does the job
wonderfully showing a diversity
and competence which marks the
real ability of the man.
Genevieve Bujoid (Coma,
Tightrope) though headlining with
Irons never shows more than a
supporting role. She is completely
outshone by the leading man and
the technical accomplishment.
On the surface Dead Ringers is
is absolutely fed up of being
chased.
In fact this becomes a motif of
the movie as we see a repetition
of chase sequences. Firstly
through a parody of Roger Rabbit's
Maroon Toon Studios, where all
the speaking parts are taken by
people in outrageous plastic
masks, perhaps in an attempt to
make Mr Jackson's look more
human.
Later we have hot pursuit
through a topsy-turvey world
reminiscent of Batman's Gotham
City. In amongst, just to hammer
the message home, is a new song
Leave Me Alone accompanied by a
video of the style favoured by
Prince and Monty Python. This
statement of irritation at the
hounding received from the press
is one of two highpoints in the
film.
The other is the video sequence
for Smooth Criminal, which gives
first airing to the next message.
Michael it seems has no objection
at all to gratuitous violence if it's
against the baddies and well
choreographed.
Another one of the pop guru's
ideologies is that drugs are bad.
Now here's a moral stance
worthy of some vinyl and a glossy
The taxi has arrived.
a thriller dealing in relationships
and the depths of closely related
psychologies. Beneath are one or
two lessons, if you care to look.
It is Bev, the scholar, who sees
all things in black and white, with
no understanding of his brother's
feelings during his period with
Claire. Although his life collapses
more dramatically when he loses
the girl it is he who copes
substantially better when all
events within his experience fall
into boxes which he may label.
Conversely Elly follows a
volatile lifestyle which is
promo but this instead turns out
to be just the obligatory narrative.
It does allow some further
shooting and killing and leads to
the most fundamental revelation
yet. Michael Jackson is, in fact, a
spaceship. More than that he is
that annual Christmas favourite,
a Transformer. His alter egos are
Robocop and a sports car, his
clever disguise is that of
overtalented megastar, this time
without sequined glove and
sporting designer finger bandages
instead.
Micnael zaps the baddie and
flies off into space, only to be hit
by a shooting star.
And as sadness descends on
the house and we mourn our
hero's departure a tiny voice
assures us that happiness will
prevail. Our final lesson is that if
you wish on a star you too could
find yourself at a Michael Jackson
concert.
Ultimately it's just another
ninety minute music video. While
Rattle and Hum is merely offering
a chance to relive the full glory of
a U2 concert, Moonwalker gives a
ringside seat in Jackson's
imagination. As you explore this
realm you begin to wonder
exactly how you got here, though
destroyed only when his most
fundamental ingredient is
removed.
Ignore these subtleties of
character if you wish. Dead Ringers
opens a touch slowly but remains
compelling viewing. It is both
tense and sad, distinguishing it
from director Cronenberg's
previous snuff movies, Scanners,
The Fly, etc.
This is not the most cheerful
movie on release, but it is worth
a visit just the same.

not necessarily where the exit is.
I left feeling a little perplexed
and worried that Michael Jackson
might actually believe all this
i stuff. Someone tell him please.
