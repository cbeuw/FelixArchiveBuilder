You may link you are unlucky as
you stag back from Christmas at
the pare us with a box full of
currant-iiiled plutonium covered in
a sc rummy laver of almond
flavoured wallpaper paste under the
pretext that you need something to
eat for the next six months.
However, such tests of endurance
as telling Aunt Agnes for the fifth
time that vou don't dish out aspirins
in Boots even if vou are called a
chemist pall into insignificance
when compared with the sheer
indignity of some who decided to
stay in London.
There are some who complain
that the content of columns like this
are highly hack-oriented. Now,
there is a reason for this, and it is
not just because I can't manage to
find the energy to get out of the
office long enough to find
something really interesting to write
about. No, the content is dominated
more bv the collective insanity
suffered bv the more active parts of
Imperial College Union, and this is
why Gutterpress is taking this
opportunity to appeal to you.
The next few paragraphs are best
read with a piece of orange peel
stuck behind your top lip, a freshly
peeled onion and the theme music
to Hearts of Gold' or 'Children in
Need'.
When people find themselves
working for the union they can be
drawn into a trap of promises and
delusion. As committee post after
committee post piles up, the sheer
weight of self-importance is enough
to crush most ordinary mortals, and
it usually does. However, the only
symptoms are not a tendency
towards Napoleonic megalomania
and a need to talk at length about
how jollv democratic UGMs are
because 'as soon as you get to a
good bit someone calls quorum;
there's power for minorities'.
There can be potentially more
devastating consequences, usually
revolving around the concept of the
Election. These exercises in
participative democracy generally
take place when posts cannot be
carved up amicably and can cause
a great deal of trauma for
prospective candidates. They can
find themselves doing all sorts of
odd and highly reportable deeds in
order to stav in print and, if they are
not sick over too many people, in
votes.
The traumas become increasingly
severe as sabbatical elections creep
ever closer, until the strain becomes
too much and they come into a
headlong collision with this column
which, considering it is only
0.05mm thick, can be quite painful.
There is only way to stop this
hideous carnage and wanton waste
of human quasi-life. When the
posters say 'Vote!', ignore them.Try
not to let the fact that someone ate
an entire caterpillar thinking it was
a snack bar meal influence your
decision. When somebody pushes
a flyer under your door, read it
carefully, peruse its inner meaning
and flambe it in a white spirit sauce.
Whatever vou do, when it comes to
ballot box time, JUST SAY NO!
You'll only encourage them.
As an example of the mindless
folly of becoming involved in
sabbatical elections we will take as
our victim the FELIX Editor, a Mr
William R Goodwin.
I remember Bill when he wanted
to be a reporter on FELIX many
years ago. He would rush into the
office and be given a task which
generally revolved around knocking
on people's doors in Linstead and
asking them questions about food,
rent strikes and Bobbie Robson's
managment of the England football
squad. This would take up much of
Bill's time, and that didn't include
the Linstead extension.
Eventually he became unhappy
with his lot and became News
Editor, and finally he was so
unhappy that he ran for FELIX
Editor and won. However, it was
too late to save him.
He decided that bringing out a
FELIX every Friday was not enough
to slake his thirst, even if he did
have to do it with three-and-a-half
staff and a rusty pair of scissors. He
thought that he could bring a little
happiness into the world with the
patter of tiny feet.
No, not another bloody
caterpillar. Babies, loads of them.
He took it upon himself to launch
attacks on all sorts of unsuspecting
victims and offer his services as a
surrogate mother, the current state
of medical technology notwith-
standing, with the immortal words:
T want his/her/your babies.' Nigel
Baker, Paul Shanley and a certain
old dinosaur and washed-up
sabbatical candidate have all
featured high on Bill's list.
However, due to popular
demand, Gutterpress is running a
book on who's next, with Wendy
Morris at 40-1 and Clare Ash and an
unnamed wide mouthed frog in
London Zoo running neck and neck
at 10-1.
Now, once upon a time there was
an erstwhile member of Motor Club
known by the highly descriptive
moniker of 'Joe 90', not least for his
passion for totally undrivable cars
and the fact that he is a complete
sleazeball.
Joe's reputation is so complete
that FELIX Editor Bill Goodwin's
only claim to fame, other than a
desire to be the first male surrogate
mother, is that he was Joe's lab
partner way back in the distant past.
To fill in a little background, Joe
is not someone who believes in the
easy way to do things. Show him a
can of beans and a tinopener and
he'll open it by holding the tin
opener in his teeth and driving over
the can with a Mini.
Which brings us conveniently on
to cars. That's nice, because Joe likes
cars, especially ones with with the
s**t kicked out of them and no
sense of direction.
When Joe went to make his latest
purchase he sought the most
clapped out old wreck he could find,
and he was not disappointed. The
old owner found that his prize
possession (well you have to dress
it up a little) failed its MoT so badly
that he decided not to pay its road
tax or insurance as it was not going
far.
All this did not worry Joe, not even
the knotty problem of getting the
object home. "I'll drive it," he
thought, even after seeing those old
police favourites, Irish number
plates. "No problem," said he.
In fact, he was so successful that
he decided to go for a celebration
drink in Southside on the way
home, just so that he could give the
rozzers a real excuse to pull him
over.

On casting an eye over his files,
Walter observes that it is almost two
years since last his presence cast a
literary shadow over these pages -
two years which have seen the rise
to power of Kenneth Papa Doc
Baker in the government, and of
Nigel Baby Doc Baker in the Union.
It is highly encouraging to see our
new President working so tirelessly
to achieve the very ends treasured
by his namesake in the Department
of Education.
Walter is rather less encouraged
to note that the price of a pint of
bitter beer in the Union Bar has
reached the order of one pound.
The new decor in the Snack Bar
looks pretty expensive. Far be it
from anvone in this column to
suggest that these two facts may be
connected... or that the new decor,
in addition to looking expensive,
also looks quite repulsive and is
certainly not an improvement on the
old.
After strict orders from both his
doctor and his psychiatrist Walter is
unable to drink alcohol, so it was
over a large orange juice in the
above mentioned Union Bar that he
was informed of the theft of a
television camera from that arbiter
of broadcast excellence, STOIC. His
informant seemed quite agitated,
which seems strange when vou
consider that the loss of a camera
here or there means little to a
television station which manages to
spend Â£ 3 5 0 0 every year
broadcasting nothing at all.
Whilst on the subject of theft, we
must give credit where credit is due.
All praise to the Union supremos
who have caused a new lock system
to be fitted in the union building.
Rather less praise to their initial
decision not to give the FELIX Editor
a kev to the new lock on the door
outside his own office. Walter
understands half an hour of
shouting at the Deputy President
was required to reverse this policy.
And after Bill has been so nice to
them, too.
Completely changing tack, have
any readers noticed that our area of
London appears to have been the
suject of a quiet international
takeover? Walter would like to
suggest that the road we used to
know as Gloucester Road should be
renamed "The Independant State of
Australia in Exile". With that
thought, we leave you.
