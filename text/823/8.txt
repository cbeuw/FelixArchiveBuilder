Feature
Common Theft
(or how to make crime pay)
A special feature all about Mascotry, who does it, who doesn't, why,
where and when and with a number of rather amusing photographs
and a comprehensive list of all those humourously named objects.
Following last term's return of
Spanner and Bolt (C&G mascots) to
them by the RCS, and all that it
entailed, we thought you might like
to know some of the history behind
the whole idea of Mascotry, how it
arose, how it works and what its
raison d'etre is.
Definition
Mascotry is: 'The practice of keeping
one's own mascot safe from theft
from a rival college, while at the
same time stealing another college's
mascot to ransom back to them for
Rag.'
Mascotry began as 'oneupman-
ship'—almost every college in the
country used to have a mascot of
one form or another—and from the
late thirties it was used as a way of
demonstrating your college's
superiority over someone else's.
Back in the days when over 500
students would gather for the
Morphy Day battle on Putney
towpath and stunts such as painting
footsteps down the side of the
Queen's Tower were commonplace,
inter-college rivalry throughout the
nation was very strong.
Symbols representing individual
colleges arose as their mascots and
these ranged-'from stuffed tapirs
through concrete carrots to Nelson's
Column. It became common
practice to run off with say, King's
lion (Reggie), remove its genitalia
with a hammer and chisel and then
leave it for them to find in a dung
heap. As far as we can tell, the only
reasons for this would be that it
caused a lot of hassle (what with
having to make a new brass pecker
for your lion and then weld it on!)—
and some might say that this would
be reason enough. Eventually some
bright spark had the idea that you
could ransom back a mascot in order
to raise money for Rag and this is
really where the story starts.
As you may or may not know,
Imperial currently has a large
selection of mascots. These are:
Mike the Micrometer
ICU's mascot since 1966. Mike was
built to replace the previous
mascots—originally Herbert (a cast
metal Phoenix who was stolen by a
teacher training college when two of
their girl students seduced their way
into the Herbert bearer's flat, got
them drunk and made off with the
mascot), then a lamppost and finally
the Queen's Tower. Mike was
designed and calibrated in RCS, cast
from spent rifle cartridges in RSM
and machined in C&G. He weighs
1701bs, is 4ft long and has had a very
chequered history, being stolen
from his display plinth MARIA
(Mascot Anti Raiding Interference
Alarm) shortly after his creation by
QMC who used pneumatic drills to
remove him.
Theta
The mascot of RCSU, a 7ft long
representation of a thermometer
made from hydraulic pipe and a
stainless steel bulb. This version is
Mk 4, inaugurated in 1975, and has
never been stolen by another
college. The original Theta was
christened in 1958 and was made
from a ballcock stuck on to a
broomhandle. Previously, RCSU
had a drum which they used to
announce their presence at
Barnights, Rag events etc etc. Theta
Mk2 went walkies from the Physics
departmental office in October 1969
and was never seen again. Version
3 emerged in 1970 and consisted of
2 litres of lead cast on to the end of
a scaff bar. The most ingeneous theft
of Theta was from the Maths
Freshers' Dinner in 1964 when a
Guildsman dressed up as a waitress
snatched Mkl from the top table
and legged it down the back stairs
in Southside with the whole Dinner
in hot pursuit (see photo).
Davey
Davey is, in fact, RSM's third
mascot. Firstly they had a plastic
Michelin man called Mitch who rode
with them on the original
Clementine (a traction engine). Next
came Davey Mkl, an incredibly
heavy miner's lamp lookalike in
RSM's colours of yellow and black.
In later years, after the creation of
the current Davey, Mk2, (fashioned
in anodised aluminium and brass
and certainly the prettiest of all the
mascots) RSM used to use Davey
Mkl as a decoy to deceive any
potential 'thieves' by carrying both
versions into and out of their UGMs
in bin liners so no one ever knew
whether they were chasing the real
Davey or not. A few years ago,
Davey Mkl went missing from the
Mines office where it was being
used as a doorstop and ended up in
the Physics level 1 common room
behind a wood panel. From there,
it disappeared and has sadly never
come to light. In one episode of
Davey's life, two RCS men spent 18
months tracking down where he
was stored in RSM by hiding in
cupboards after RSM UGM's and
listening out for the Davey Bearers
going by. Eventually they narrowed
down the location of the mascot to
one particular storeroom in the
basement and hid behind a filing
cabinet just outside as Davey was
put away. Later that night they
returned with hacksaws, hammers,
drills and boltcutters, picked the
lock to the room and demolished the
only cupboard therein which was
Davey's hideyhole.
Spanner and Bolt
In order to protect Bo Mk 1 (C&G's
original veteran car) from harm by
other colleges, the Bo driver used to
threaten them with the biggest
spanner in the toolbox. Over the
years, as Bo became more valuable,
Guild's mascot changed to being a
large Spanner instead. Several
Spanners have existed, the first was
lost to Kings, the second broke
when sat on by a Guildsman just
after being recovered from being
buried in Putney towpath and the
third they have now. Bolt is a fairly
new acquisition by comparison, but
quite nicely made in the traditional
style (ie bloody heavy!). RCS have
just handed back S&B to Guilds
following their removal from the
boot of a car last March. This was
the first inter-CCU mascotry that
has been played fairly for a very
long time, with RCS designing a
Treasure Hunt for the Guildsmen to
