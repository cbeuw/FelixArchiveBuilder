The FELIX Club, founded in 1975, was established to encourage fellowship
between the past and present members of FELIX, and to act as a source
of support for the newspaper. The Club has its origins in the campaigns
fought against particular attacks by the Union on the freedom of the paper
in the three years prior to its formation. The battles between FELIX and
the Union were 'dirty, ruthless, underhand and bloody'.
In the following article, Mike Llewellyn-Williams, FELIX Editor 1974-75,
recounts the developments which led to the clubs formation.
Origins of the Club
The origins of the FELIX Club, or
rather the origins of the developments
which led to the conception of such
a club, can be traced to the
beginning of the academic session
1974-75. It was a period of
inexorable change in many ways,
not least of all being the way in
which FELIX was physically
produced. The key event was the
change from contract letterpress to
offset-litho print production
in-house.
Prior to this time, the newspaper
Clashes between the
Editor of FELIX and

Union are nothing
new
had for several years been printed
outside the College, which meant in
terms of production, that no
pasting-up, folding or collating was
necessary. The Editors simply had
to send all the copy together with
rough page lay-out designs to the
printers and they would do the rest.
Editorial staff, in terms of numbers,
was minimal and largely ad hoc;
production staff was . effectively
zero.
Early in 1974, with printing costs
escalating dramatically, the Union
agreed with the College that an
offset-litho printing unit plus five
years' supply of paper would be
purchased using College funds and
housed in the then Union executives
suite of offices until such a time as
the College had sufficient space to
absorb it next to its own printing
unit. The agreement also entailed
recruitment of two professional staff
(to be paid for out of Union finances)
and rehousing the Union Office in
its current location (the old TV
room).
It was further understood that the
primary purpose of the new unit
was the production of FELIX
(without any prejudice to the
College's printing needs; it was,
after all, the College's machinery).
Now with the Editor suddenly
faced with the unprecedented
prospect of organising the complete
production schedule from start to
finish as well as the more usual
reporting, writing and editing, the
drama started. In the first instance,
the catastrophic rupture of the
hitherto generally accepted work
routine of the Editor (which was
exacerbated by continual print-
machincy breakdowns) went
largely unnoticed.
Which meant that when FELIX
was unable in the first instance to
crack the enormous production
problems encountered and as a
result could not immediately
maintain continuity in terms of
content and 'up-to-the-minute'-
ness, the newspaper was showered
with criticisms which displayed total
ignorance and complete lack of
understanding of the new problems
created by the new printing process.
Countless editorial explanations
went largely unheeded and nothing

but hard slog, often working

FELIX on the rails.
Enter key factor number two
The President and Hon Sec of the
Union during 1974-75, in a coma of
dizzy-heights grandeur, held the
view that the entire Union
membership should adopt a
coherent, single-minded posture

when dealing with the College
administration, particularly when
negotiating for Union funds each
year. Although assured of rank-and-
file support in theory, Union
General Meetings were poorly
attended. Worse still, the Council,
which held the Union's purse
strings, was composed of irrational
self-seeking factions. Hardly a basis
then of presenting a united front to
the College.
However, with a lot of hard work
and persuasive acumen, the
President succeeded in acting
presidential at UGM's, wooed the
Council factions to a pretence of
unanimity and even bamboozled
the internecine Constituent College
Union Presidents into accepting the
notion of collective responsibility
within the ICU executive. So far so
good.
The next step in the chain of
events was the suggestion of the
creation of a sabbatical Junior
Treasurer. And since the College
was in no mood whatsoever to
create a fourth sabbatical (the three
existing ones were President, Hon
Sec and FELIX Editor), this could
only be achieved bv taking the third
sabbatical from FELIX and re-
allocating it.
The President's timing for such a
suggestion, with FELIX under fire
and with the enormous problems
created by the new printing process
largely unperceived, was
impeccable. For all the President's
men, it seemed a logical extension
for increasing union efficiency
whilst simultaneously crippling a
potentially dissenting voice in the
political arena. For those of us on
the FELIX staff, our superhuman
efforts on the newspaper largely
unsung, it amounted to a
declaration of war.
And it was indeed a council of war
that was called that night in the
FELIX Office. Our retailiation tactics

were quickly agreed, they were
nothing ishort of a strategic
conspiracy which was to defend
FELIX to the death if necessary!
The campaigning that ensued was
dirty, ruthless, underhand and
bloody. We were taking no
hostages. And by sheer persuasion
and force of argument mixed with
complete. And just as war can bring
people together and bind them
together in the heat of conflict, so
this 'war' produced the indomitable
fighting spirit which can create a
unanimity of purpose. It was this
spirit which would later be
harnessed and would lead to the
the occasional hyperbolic threat, we
won the day, in as legitimate a
manner as any politician can claim
to act in.
It was several conspiracies and

one highly acrimonious council
meeting later that we were able to
cheer 'Felicide averted' on the front
page. Several more conspiracies,
one working party investigation and
yet another highly acrimonious
council meeting, it was all over. The
President and Hon Sec were
isolated, beaten and thrashing about
in defeat.
The FELIX staff got as pissed as
rats that night. The triumph in the
face of hostilities had been
foundation of the FELIX Club.
Clashes between the Editor of
FELIX and the President of the
Union are nothing new. They've
happened several times in the past
and perhaps one of the most
publicised was in the session
1963/64. It started with the President
disagreeing strongly with the
sentiments of what the Editor had
written in the newspaper, followed
by stinging criticism from the Editor,
then outrage from the President,
then a rebuttal etc., etc. Fortunately
for us, the 'freedom of the press'

argument won the day and the
President lost the face-to-face UGM
showdown on the subject.
Major acrimonious disputes of a
similar- nature also occurred in
1972/73 and 73/74 which clearly
highlighted the Editor's increasing
vulnerability to interference from
self-important Union bureaucrats.
For those of us on the
FELIX staff, our
superhuman efforts
on the paper largely
unsung, it amounted
to a declaration of war
The 73/74 programme of
harrassment of FELIX actually
ended with the forced resignation of
the Editor after just one term of
office.
The 1974/75 dispute then
effectively cystallised our intention
to reduce this perennial
vulnerability. In the spirit of 'Let us
prevent FELIX from being
threatened by the Union again', a
policy of respectable entrenchment
ensued.
One strategy was legitimately to
enhance FELIX's image, essentially
to 'institutionalise' it. The crest and
Editor's honour board evolved as a
result.
Another tactic was to position
FELIX not just as a recorder of
events, but also as a sponsor of
events. Thus was born the annual
FELIX motor rally and photographic
competition.
The final strategy concerned
staffing. It was agreed that ideally
the newspaper's staff should spring
from the CCU's. And if they were
union officials then so much the
better in terms of achieving a better
understanding of FELIX's problems.
Nothing but hard
slog, often working
through the night,
was keeping FELIX on
the rails
Lastly, the idea of a staff tie was
developed. It was to be a single red
cat on a blue background, but the
red was changed at the last minute
to silver/white in token of the 25th
anniversary of FELIX's foundation.
It was shortly afterwards that the
idea of forming a club arose.
The FELIX staff by now had
developed into a closely knit group
of partisans, united in their
opposition to Union
interventionism. Within that
framework, the notion of forming a
club along the lines of other IC clubs
(an hence rekindling the spirit
which was once enshrined in the old
Scriblerus Club) took root.
The Club was to serve several
purposes such as: an aid to staff
recruitment; a source of ideas; a
course of support; a vehicle by
which old members could keep in
touch with FELIX and each other; a
promoter of good fellowship
between members old and new.
Friday, the newspaper's
publication day, was chosen as the
day that the Tie had to be worn on
pain of forfeiture of a pint. The Club
• was formally devised on an elective
basis and thereby assumed an
aspirational status for newcomers to
the FELIX staff. Past Editors were
considered automatically eligible for
membership and the task of tracing
them across the globe was pursued
with some notable success.
Since its formal foundation in
October 1975, the Club has gone
from strength to strength despite
the odd bout of soul-searching and
constitutional revision. Given the
origins of the Club however, it's
perhaps not really surprising that
some of the older members can
occasionally feel defensive with
regard to the relatively
unencumbered autonomy of FELIX
which survives today because of
their own vigilence and
uncompromising persistence.
It will be the new
members who will
hold the key to the
future
I certainly hope we all try never
to lose sight of these 'fighting spirit'
origins. In the final analysis though
it will be the new menbers who will
hold the key to the future and it is
to them we must look for the
maintenar.ee of the institution we've
helped to construct.
So, long mav it flourish, and Keep
the Cat Free!
