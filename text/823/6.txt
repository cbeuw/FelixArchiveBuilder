RAIL EUROPE
Gone are the great days of rail
travel—when the rich took the
luxurious Orient Express to
Istanbul, and rail was the only way
to travel across Europe. The
aeroplane put paid to that.
However, in recent years rail travel
has been revived as a cheap way for
young people M see Europe. The
national rail companies of many
countries, in an attempt to fill empty
trains, have opened up a series of
cheap fare deals for under 26's, that
has led to the European rail network
being innundated by thousands of
backpackers every summer, intent
on 'doing' as much of Europe as
possible in the time available.
Rail is an ideal way to see Europe.
The network is the densest in the
world; nearly any destination can be
reached by rail, and if this is not
possible, the rail head will be only
a coach's journey away from the
destination. There is no lack of
companions on your journeys,
climb aboard any train with
backpack in tow and you will soon
strike up a conversation with any>
inter- railers on the train. And, take
a bottle of the local gut rot and a few
goodies from the local supermarket
with you to while away the hours
on long journeys, the guards always
seem pleased to share it with you!
Because the network is so
extensive, there is no limit to the
itinaries available. In fact, everybody
seems to do it adifferent way. Many
people use a ticket as a cheap way
to reach the Greek islands for a laze
on the beach, taking in a few
European cities on the way, or there
are the manic inter-railers who
spend their time sleeping
exclusively on trains, 'doing' every
country in Europe during the period
of the ticket. There are also the
specialists, who travel to one
country and then tour it in detail,
like the two Oxbridge types who
spent a month touring the Gothic
cathedrals of northern France
(yawn!). Whatever your fancy,
Europe is your oyster.
THE OPTIONS
There are essentially two ways to
see Europe by train on the cheap -
Inter-Rail and Transalpino. Both are
only available to under 26s, and if
you don't fit that category, then
things can get very expensive.
An Inter-Rail card, available from
major British Rail stations, gives you
unlimited rail travel for one month
through 21 countries in Europe,
including Morocco, European
Turkey, Hungary and Rumania. The
basic card costs £145, but an Inter-
Rail + Boat card is also available for
£175, which also allows free travel
on some Mediterranean,
Scandinavian and Irish shipping
routes. Either card will also give a
34% discount on rail fares in the
United Kingdom, and a discount on
cross channel ferries. It is a good
idea to remember that it will cost
quite a bit to leave and return to the
U.K. when budgeting for an Inter-
Rail trip. Also, you can only travel
on standard second class trains. This
can be a problem in some countries,
particularily Spain, where extra
supplements have to be paid for
travelling express, or in air
conditioned luxury.
A Transalpino ticket is available
from one of several Transalpino
shops in London (see the telephone
directory). Normally, the ticket will
be a return to a single destination,
valid for two months. The great
strength of Transalpino is that the
outward and return journeys can be
made via two different routes, and
Eiffel Tower, Paris.
stops can be made at any point
along the route. Transalpino tickets
are also valid twice as long as Inter-
Rail, and compare favourably in
price. In order to take best
advantage of Transalpino, choose a
distant destination like Athens, and
then travel out via Italy and the
ferry, and then return via
Yugoslavia and Northern Europe.
Fares within Great Britain and
channel crossings are included in
the price of the ticket.
VISAS
An extra expense for those travelling
to Eastern Block countries, and non
EEC nationals in France, will be a
visa. These can normally be
purchased on the border, but it is
best to check with the relevant
embassy in London. Note that
Bulgaria is not part of Inter-Rail, so
to travel to Istanbul one must pay
the extra to travel through Bulgaria,
or take the roundabout route via
Salonica in Greece. The really
adventurous can take a train to
Moscow, and then on to Peking on
the Trans-Siberian railway.
THE TRAINS
Accomodation on international
trains in Europe is pretty
standard—coaches with
compartments seating eight people.
However, the state of the coaches is
highly dependent on the country of
origin. On international trains,
Northern European and French
coaches are the best, Spanish and
Italian can be okay, but they can also
be bad, and avoid Yugoslavian
coaches like the plague. In the south
of Spain, go for air conditioning if
at all possible.
For journeys within individual
countries, the same standards as
above seem to apply, but there are
always exceptions to any rule!
The truly hardened traveller will
roll out his or her sleeping bag on
thefloorwithout complaining on an
overnight trip, but for those who
prefer a little comfort for those long
journeys, couchettes are available.
Couchette compartments seat six
people, and can be converted to
sleep six people on beds in relative
comfort. You are provided with
sheets, and a guard to wake you in
the morning. Again, these are pretty
standard.
