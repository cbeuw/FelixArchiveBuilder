Top up loans
too expensive
The cost of administering the
proposed student top-up' loan
scheme will far outweigh any
savings it could make according to
a report by Dr Nicholas Barr of thr
London School of Economics.
The Governments claims that the
taxpayer will save £230 million by
the year 2027 are mistaken according
to Dr Barr who estimates it will cost
£150 million more than the present
grant scheme.
According to the report, Banks
and Building Societies are unwilling
to participate in the scheme unless
they are able to recoup their
administrative costs - about £100 per
student.'
The Government proposes
freezing the grants at 1990 levels and
phasing in a loan until it matches the
level of the grant estimated to be in
the year 2007.

Queen's Tower
causes Government
split
The fate of the Queens Tower at
Imperial may have caused a
dangerous split in the government
of Harold Macmillan in 1958
according to secret cabinet minutes,
released under the thirty vear rule.
The papers show that ministers
disagreed over the proposals to
demolish the 287 foot Italianate
tower after a public outcry headed
by Sir John Betjemin (later to
become the Poet Laureate) and the
Roval Fine Art Commission.
The government was forced to
reconsider the development
proposals, the only Higher
Education issue to be considered
above committee level in 1958.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
claimed that to stabilise the Queens
Tower, originally part of the
Imperial lnstute Building and
historically unconnected with IC,
would have cost £200,000 but to pull
it down only £40,000. 'To the charge
of vandalism thev would no doubt
add a charge of breach of faith. I
doubt whether the resulting row
would be worthwhile,' he said.
The Queens Tower was reprieved
as a free standing campanile the
form in which it stands now ,
against the Chancellor's wish to
save money and much to the
chagrin of the architects, who
wanted to build on the site.
