Union
What's on in Ents
First of all there's the Carnival on
Friday 13 January which I'm sure
will be detailed elsewhere in this
issue. Doors open at 8.00pm and
there will be a happy hour until
9pm. The ticket price is good value
even just to see the band, The James
Taylor Quartet, never mind the rest
of the activities.
On Saturday January 2.1, the first
rugby international between
Scotland and Wales will be shown
in the Union Bar on the 50" screen.
The Bar will be open for the
duration of the match and there will
be food available. The other
internationals will be shown on Sat
February 4, February 18, March 4
and March 18.
On January 22, the Superbowl will
be on in the Union Lounge starting
late with refreshments served
throughout the night. This will
hopefully be attended by a large
contingent from the American
Institute for Foreign Study.
The first of the regular bar quizes
will begin on Tuesday Jan 24 and
will be repeated every other week
after that. Teams of up to four can
enter for only 50p per person. Prizes
include cash and drinks.
Thursday January 26 sees one of
the biggest events IC Union has ever
dared to put on: a professional
wrestling tournament in the Great
Hall. There will be four male bouts
and a female one, with competitors
supplied by the company that
provided ITV with its wrestling
programme. Tickets will be £2.50
and £4 for ringside seats. Don't be
put off by any preconceptions, go
along because it's an absolute
scream.
On February 10, Silwood Park are
having a Valentine's Party and
coaches will hopefully be provide as
per the Bonfire Night. There will be
two live bands, a disco and a bar
extension.
The Hyde Park Relay will take
place on Saturday February 18 and
along with Rag the competitors will
be collecting for BIBIC. They will
gather in the Union Building for a
huge party with a bar extension and
a very paltry ticket price.
As a result of ULU's resolve on
the Poll Tax, we decided that rather
than having a one day shut down
we would hold a 'Stuff the Poll Tax
Carnival' in the Union Building on
Wednesday March 22, the last day
of the Spring Term. This will give
everybody the chance to spend the
money they would ordinarily
reserve for the Community Charge
on having a good time—you know
it makes sense.
Besides all of the above, there will
be regular Ents gigs on Friday
evenings (showing the best small
bands in London for ridiculous
prices) and free discos every
Wednesday night.
Have a good term.

Tonight is the
Carnival night
Tonight, in the Union Building, IC
Ents are putting on a Carnival to
welcome everybody back this year.
The flysheets in this FELIX show
the times and places where
everything is going on, but I'll take
this opportunity to run through
what's happening.
Bands. Headlining are the
unmissable James Taylor Quartet.
What can I say? The band started off
playing television theme tunes such
as Mission Impossible. Last year they
signed a major record deal with
Pollydor, and the recently released
Starskey and Hutch theme took them
well into the top 100. The band are
on the brink of success and play
some of the most dancable music
around.
Supporting are That Swing
Thang—a Scottish band who play
swing and jive, recently featured on
TV on New Year's Eve.
Theatre. Don't worry if you're
thinking this will be a bit heavy. The
Contagious Performance Company are
doing a comdey show to tie in with
AIDS awareness week. It's very
funny and well worth popping in
for.
Comedy. Very funny stand-
up/clown and comedian Pierre
Hollins starts off the evening—a
highly amusing man.
Casino. Roulette, Blackjack etc.
Many pounds worth of prizes to be
won—collect your vouchers on the
front door.
Film—as it's Friday 13th, it had to
be a late night horror film—Friday
Night will be shown.
Disco. IC Ents Disco till the early
hours in the Lounge.
Breakfast. If you're still around
late on, pop into the UDH for
something to eat and some coffee.
Transport. Free transport home
for women, departing at regular
intervals from Beit Arch—times will
be shown on the night.
All this plus happy hour 8-9pm in
the Union Bar, cocktails upstairs,
burgers in the quad, and a Rag
cloakroom in the Union Office.
Finally, just a reminder—don't
forget your Union cards. You'll need
them to get in, but you can sign
other people in with them.
Have fun,
Paul Watkiss, Ents Chair.
