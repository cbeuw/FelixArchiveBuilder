Protest Against Government 'Loans Scheme' Continues
I.C.U. Plans Lobby of Parliament
Imperial College students' union
have planned a lobby of Parliament
next Thursday as part of the
continuing protest against the
Government's 'Top-Up loans for
students scheme.' The action will
involve a large number of IC
students gathering at parliament to
talk to, and in some cases present
letters to their own local MPs
stressing what they see as the
pitfalls of the loans scheme.
IC Union president, Nigel Baker,
presented the ideas for the lobby to
the college's governing body who
were described by the Rector, Eric
Ash, as being "sympathetic to the
critique of the plans." The Rector
has written to the heads of all
college departments supporting
Nigel Baker's requests that a
cancellation or rescheduling of
lectures for that afternoon might be
effected. Nigel Baker is also in the
process of visiting 65 per cent of
college department years to explain
the plans and a simple 'show-of-
hands' vote has been conducted in
each case to determine the number
of students willing to boycott
Thursday afternoon lectures for the
lobby, should their department not
agree to a change in time-table. In
all cases so far the majority vote has
been in favour of a boycott.
A petition has been drafted by the
union which states that "the
undersigned believe that the
introduction of student loans will be
detrimental to the future of higher
education and that the loan
proposals put forward by this
government should be withdrawn."
Copies of this have been circulated
around all college departments and
the union believes that it will receive
"a significantly large number of
signatures."
At 1 pm on Thursday Mr Peter
Brook, MP for Westminster South,
is due to address the college on the
issue of student loans. As a
Conservative MP he will be
emphasising the government's
argument on the issue. The address
will involve a large amount of time
set aside for questions, will take
place in the Great Hall and will
include the presentation of the
college-wide petition to Mr Brook by
Nigel Baker.
At 2 pm Nigel Baker will make a
short speech stressing the aims of
the lobby and the mode of action to
be taken.
Later that afternoon the students
involved will gather at the Houses
of Parliament. There will be no
march, so the plans pose no risk of
arrest as witnessed at the NUS
march on 24th November last year.
The President hopes that many
students will have prepared letters
to their MPs briefly stressing the
argument against loans and
requesting that the MPs meet
representatives of the students'
union and pass on their concerns to
Secretary of State for Education, Mr.
Kenneth Baker.
The action will be followed by
another march on 1st February
organised by NUS London which IC
students' union will be supporting.
Students will march from Finsbury
Circus through the city to
Shoreditch Park.
Conference
Office
Re-shuffle
The Conference Office has been
reorganised this holiday, following
the resignation of the Cc -ference
Officer, Miss Gill Davies.
Refectories Manager, Mr Rob
Northey, has now taken
responsibility for conferences. He
will oversee the catering himself and
work with Loretto O'Callaghan to
organise the accomodation.
Mr Northey told FELIX that the
plans for the change were initiated
before he started his job 3-4 years
ago, and that the job has always
been in his contract, but the Rector,
Eric Ash, was keen to stress that
Miss Davies has 'not left because of
any tension at all, but because she
felt she would like a new job after
being here for a number of years.'

New London College
One of the most deprived inner-city
areas of London is to be the site of
the first new college in London for
15 years which is due to open its
doors by January 1990. The new
Further Education College will
initially be based at the Arbour
Square and Jubilee Street premises
of the City and East London College
and at Hackney College's Poplar
Centre. A new extension is to be
built on which work has already
started. The plans have been
received with great enthusiasm by
the London Education Business
Partnership and the East End Local
Employer Network, but were
described by a spokesman from the
Department of Education and
Science as 'simply renaming
existing parts of Hackney College'.
The plans were sumitted by Tower
Hamlets Borough Council in a
scheme set up to involve individual
boroughs in education as the
