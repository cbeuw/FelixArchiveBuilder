Opinion
view
From
View from a Bridge is a series of
opinion articles by the 1987-88
Union President about life at
College; the rights and wrongs of
how it is run, the personalities
within it and its future within the
British education system.
This series does not intend to pull
any punches, it will annoy a
number of people, especially those
who deserve it, but also a number
of the author's friends. It will
doubtlessly damage the author's
relationship with the College and
the Union and two of the articles
may in fact affect his degree result.
The material within the series is
solely the opinion of the author and
does not represent facts unless they
are implicitely stated to be so.
If you have any desire to write in
response to these articles, please do
so but remember that it may be
wise to ask for the Editor to
withhold your name from the letter.
The author does not intend to reply
to any letters written regarding
previous articles but is interested to
hear other people's opinions.
Nige! Baker
Althougii the best candidate for the
job at the time beating his 'joke
candidate' opponent by a vast
majority and showing all the
potential to be an extremely good
leader of the Union, Nigel Baker
appears to think he is the Union.
The megalomania virus which
appears to have taken control of our
President has resulted in him
forgetting who put him in office and
who can oust him if they're not
satisfied. Mr -Baker informs his
Council of his actions rather than
asking their opinion in advance. He
appears to take advice from very
few people and rarely fraternises
with students.
The Union Office is run as an
efficient new package with a
marvelous wrapping of bureaucracy
all tied up in pretty red tape. New
'self help' schemes have been
established; 'you want a minibus,
well what do you expect me to do,
pull one out of a hat? Here's a
telephone directory, go and find one
yourself.
One student who had a complaint
about a Union trading outlet was
sent to a random location in College;
this new procedure was called
'passing the buck'. The Office now
closes at 5.30pm with no exceptions,
Diplomat Extraordinaire, Sydney Harbour-Bridge
addresses the United Nations on the subject of
this year's sabbaticals.
Mr Baker seems to have forgotten
that most students are timetabled
until 5.30pm. My belief was that the
Union was there to provide a service
for the students to help them find
their way through the jungle of
bureaucracy thown up by College
and London life and not to provide
a training ground for up-and-
coming bureaucrats.
Nigel often treats his Deputy
President with contempt, ridiculing
him in front of staff and students
whilst obscuring much of the
Union's work from him. There is
very little doubt in my mind that
much of the lack of action on the
part of the DP is due a distinct
absence of encouragement from his
peers.
So what has Nigel D Baker done
this for? Well so far Nigel's aim of
having an Office with as few
students in it as possible has not in
fact encouraged anyone to take up
the posts of Welfare Officer or
External Affairs Officer and as a
result much of his time has been
spent in Welfare.
This year the Welfare Committee
has not been called, even though it
is bound by its articles to meet at
least once a term, nevertheless Nigel
has managed to spend a large
quantity of that Committee's budget
on a series of campaigns and a
questionnaire for which expenditure
was not authorised by any
committee. Furthermore, he has
managed to appoint a Welfare
Adviser at almost double the cost of
the one that left, negotiating a
lucrative deal with College that cost
the Union a sizeable society room
and around Â£7,000 a year ad
infinitum.
Nigel has also worked in the area
of accommodation, where it appears
he has rubbed a number of the
College wardens up the wrong way.
It is what Nigel has not done that
really demonstrates the potential of
the man in national party politics.
Still on the matter of accommo-
dation, Nigel managed to totally
ignore the complaints regarding rent
levels emanating from the queue of
students outside his office. It was
not until a bemused student fell
through Ian Morris' door thinking
it was the way out and explained
that there was a brick wall sitting in
the President's chair that something
eventually got done.
The topic of Athletics poses the
question of why the President
ignored a paper passed by Council
last year aimed at defining the
Union's ownership of Harlington
Sports Ground, the three million
pound gravel fund and certain other
facilities, whilst allowing a totally
different constitution to go all but
unquestioned at the Athletics
Committee.
The External Affairs Committee
has not yet met this year even
though we have seen the onset of
the student loans scheme, a
committment from the Union to
become involved in the 1990 Council
elections and the fact that it is bound
to meet three times a term.
The situtation concerning the
merger with the Union at St Mary's
seems to have deteriorated further
following Nigel calling the St Mary's
President 'a big fish in a small pond'
and a merger now looks unlikely for
at least a year.
We must ask why our President
has not acted decisively concerning
student loans and the effect it will
have on this College? Why did he
support the ULU President who was
in favour of many of the present
Government's policies on education
and why is he not acting as he
agreed, in an aim to oust Tory
Councillors from the local Council
to aid College planning permission?
Perhaps his personal politics are
hindering his ability to represent his
students fully?
At the same time deep down
Nigel is a hard working, dedicated
and extremely capable Union
President, whom I once would have
considered a good friend. Presently
