CLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW
AWOL @ The Camden Palace
A
fter hearing so much about
those now legendary AWOL
nights down the Paradise
Club of a few years back, hearing
the tapes but never actually going
to one, when I saw they were doing
a one off night down the Camden
Palace I just had to go. I knew it
would be nothing like the original
nights, but it was as close as I was
going to get without the aid of time
travel. For those of you who don't
know, AWOL made their name dur-
ing the early '90's, putting on regu-
lar all-nighters playing a unique
blend of ground-breaking with
trend setting drum and bass.
This one-off night was also
being held in conjunction with
Public Demand records, a fast
emerging Garage label who took
over the second arena to celebrate
the launch of their new album,
Backed By Public Demand. I
attended a night down here a few
months back but never made it to
the second arena: no wonder, it's
hidden away at the very top of this
massive venue, up five or six dodgy
back stairwells. To be honest, in
comparison to the vastness of the
Palace, this second arena is pis-
stakingly small. Fifty people nearly
filled it, but that said it was still
rocking in there and the DJ, who
ever it was, was rolling.
For those of you who have
never been to the Camden Palace,
it was a theatre before being con-
verted into one of London leading
venues with a capacity of at least
1,500. The set up is a stage/DJ box
with a large dancefloor splayed out
in front of it, then about six rows of
balconies of varying width going up
to the ceiling.
We took up position on the
second from top balcony, where
we could see the breathtaking view
of thousands of people having it,
the DJ mixing and the stunning light
display - most impressive. Last
time I was here, I was knocked out
by the light display, and they have
done it up again since then - with
the centre piece being the most
powerful laser I've seen, and I've
seen plenty. Everyone I spoke to
mentioned how shit-hot it was - it
really needs to be seen to be
believed.
DJs on the night were JJ Frost,
Rap, Zinc, Grooverider, Andy C,
Kenny Ken, who played a wicked
set that just rolled along, and the
scratchmaster Hype, who got
straight down to business and
totally blew up the place - the ulti-
mate entertainer. It was a little
harsh putting the up and coming
newcomer DJ Scope on right after
Hype, and making such a big thing
about him being a new DJ, which
could have only made the geezer
more nervous than ever, and how
do you follow Hype? Well, not
badly really from what 1 heard and
considering records were jumping
all over the place after Hype had
fucked the needles after going
crazy on the decks, he sounded as
good as anyone to me.
Overall a excellent night with a
great atmosphere not always asso-
ciated with Drum and Bass nights -
especially when they stopped serv-
ing alcohol before we even got
there (Sunday license). Shock hor-
ror, even a fair number of ladies in
the place. Be sure to look out for
some more dates in the not too
distant future.

efore starting a review of an
album, I generally listen to it
jotting down the tracks that
stand out for some reason, good or
bad. With this one, I found myself
putting down one track after anoth-
er. If it wasn't for the slightly more
experimental numbers toward the
end, they would have all been put
down as outstanding tracks. It's
OK, I'm not going to try and explain
each one in detail, instead I'll tell
you about a couple of my
favourites and some that are so
nearly great tracks out of the
twelve, but just miss.
Click and Cycle - Trippin' (Tonic
remix) starts things off in fine fash-
ion: dark, hard and definitely trip-
ping on those haunting key tones,
killer beats, breaks and effects.
Next, L Double and Acetate bring in
the jazz lick with Style Wars: dron-
ing bassline runs alongside jazz
trumpet or something similar then
after the first breakdown this is dis-
pensed with and a drum pattern
not all that dissimilar to Warhead
takes over: wicked track. Dylan of
Droppin' Science Duo has pro-
duced another tearing track, hard,
even fierce and dark: loads going
on: awesome. T-Power brings in a
more experimental style of track as
does Basic Unit, music for the mind
not just the body.
Next up Elements Of Noise .
This starts off with a similar experi-
mental feel, then halfway through it
drops big time, transforming into a
more dance floor number: clever
stuff.
Although I haven't got any of
these on vinyl, they all sound famil-
iar due to them being played in the
clubs. Most of the tracks here have
a dark edge, yet all are interpreted
in different ways, in general, it's
amazing how these people manage
to get such feeling and emotion out
of a bunch of transistors and
processors.
So, an upfront account of
where Drum and Bass is today, if
slightly distorted towards the dark
side. Oh, did I mention that this
comes on either an un-mixed or
mixed CD: nice for us to be given
the choice for a change. The mix is
taken care of by Ray Keith, bringing
the sound of Movement
(Thursday's at Bar Rumba) to your
living room.

To the person I sent down to
review Helta Skelta, got in for
nothing (saving you £25),
jumping the extensive queues,
thanks for not even bothering to
write down a few words about it.
You know who you are - I'll break
your legs later.
Nevermind, I've
been to plenty of Helta
Skelta events before
now at the Sanctuary,
Milton Keynes and I can
tell you what to expect:
two massive arenas
with a capacity for
5,000 party people,
friendly and helpful
security, fuck-off sound
and lighting rigs and the
best hardcore and drum
and bass DJs. Well, the It's how Big?
pictures pretty much tell their own
story.
If you're around the Stoke-On-
Trent area on the 17th July, look
out for their first ever club night at
the Void Club.
Most promoters start off by
doing club nights then
go on to do huge ware-
house style parties.
Not Helta Skelta. They
prefer to do it the other
way - do you think
they're Irish or some-
thing ?
