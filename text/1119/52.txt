G
iven that last week the final
had been rained off,
Tuesdays forecast was scru-
tinised by everyone. Surely w e were
in luck this time - the TV weather
map didn't show a raincloud any-
where in the greater counties. Sadly,
Ketley had had it coming out of his
arse again and by the time w e got to
M o t s p u r park w e
needed a Kayak to
inspect the track.
Never the less, after
an hour's wait, the
flood waters dis-
persed and Jon
(arch negotiator)
twisted the
umpires' arms into
playing - much to
the disappointment
of Royal Holloway
w h o were busy
w a t c h i n g
Neighbours.
The early
Holloway scorecard
made delightful
reading with Steve
Trussels' raw pace and Ra]s tricky
seaming proving too much for the
upper order and they were reduced
to 24 for 3. A successful rear-guard
action was staged by some of the
Holloway middle order big hitters
but owing to some fine catches
(especially by Andy, managing to
keep his eyes on the ball as it
returned from the upper tropos-
phere) and to Nigel who, with his
uncanny ability to pitch the ball right
in a batsmen's gonads, s o o n
reduced their batting lineup in num-
ber and fertility. Things were going
well it seemed until skipper Andy
came on and felt sporting enough to

aloft the cup.
bowl three overs of complete pies,
and the Holloway batting stuttered
to a half decent (well pretty piss-
poor, actually) score of 114 all out.
Fired up by an inspiring speech
from the skipper, our own innings
got off to a questionable start of 5
for 4, leaving us in the strange posi-
tion of having Jon, Yann, Imran and
Andy muster only a
single run between
them. With the
wickets tumbling,
the supporters wan-
dering inside to
watch the football,
the captain busy
smashing up the
changing room and
the whole of the
lower order hastily
padding up disaster
seemed inevitable.
But Raj, our resident
Sri Lankan beefy
bastard gave their
bowling some heat
and pulled off some
strokes that had the
height and distance to make a
respectable 3-iron look pretty poor.
Raj pulled the team out from the
depths of deepest d o o - d o o with an
awesome display of power-house
batting. A mention also to Alex who
supported the other end of the
wicket with equal style and power,
but w h o was very badly dropped by
a man in a black velvet shirt stand-
ing just in front of the scorebox.
So the day was ours, Holloway
skulked off back to their union (lucky
bastards) and for the fourth time in
69 years the IC 1 st XI (or as we call
it now, the Raj Honourary 1st XI)
returned as UL Champions

Q ' s Walking Club training for the
last fixture of the year had been
I intense right up to the big day
on 7 June. A new competition for
the boyz and grrrls, set out to win
the 10 km walk and leave a lasting
impression. In the end only the
fourth team - The Faggy Fourths -
made it to the starting line.
Known previously to walk long
distances only in order to get that
Gaultier shirt for half price, the
Faggy Fourths put on a brave face
against a well prepared and surpris-
ingly good-looking opposition - all
2 5 0 0 of t h e m . The enthusiasm
shown at the Royal Festival Hall was
quickly lost along The Embankment
as broken cloud became showers.
What started as an eager push at
The South Bank became a tired drag
along The Mall as spirits seemed to
have been broken. It became clear
that the quality of the other teams
meant we were not going to win. As
the rain set in, a diversion for coffee
at Trafalgar Square guaranteed our
'Also Ran' position but revived lag-
ging spirits. The half-way water and
sunshine at Hungerford Bridge
revived tired feet and lead to lash-
ings of competitive spirit.
The battle for first member of
The Fourths to cross the line began.
Clear leaders were Skate Grrrl, Tom
Boy and Bottle Blonde, with U L U
Bod and Butch bringing up the rear.
A late spurt from Shorty saw her
catch up, while Skate Grrrl and Bottle
Blonde fell back. Butch returned to
the back of the pack with U L U Bod.
Shorty and Tom Boy where the first
two from The Fourths across the line
at Hays Galleria, with U L U Bod and
Butch finishing where they had been
for most of the walk - at the back.
W e decided winning was not
everything, especially as they had
managed to raise over Â£ 5 0 0 for
Crusaid. M a n of The Match went to
Shorty for raising the most money.

Sports review of the year.
Hullo my beauties.
So what great sporting
achievements have w e been get-
ting up to this year? Well, to tell
you the truth, I have no idea. This
is because, I'm afraid to say, that I
never bothered to read any of the
articles, apart f r o m a cursory
glance to see what sport was
involved. W h e n it became neces-
sary to edit the length of articles 1
did so not in any attempt to main-
tain their narrative structure, but
rather 1 did it in such a way as to
make the page look aesthetically
pleasing. For the most part 1 did
this by creating abstract patterns.
However if y o u have a copy of last
week's Felix, hold it at arm's
length and stare at it fixedly. After
a few minutes y o u should be able
to make out a rudimentary repro-
duction of Leonardo Da Vinci's
Last supper. Jesus' head is a bit
elongated but other than that it's
surprisingly accurate.
"But hang on Jake" y o u may be
saying (if so, please refrain from
being so familiar, it's M r Thome to
you) "if y o u couldn't be bothered
to read any of the articles, why did
you become sports editor in the
first place?" There were two rea-
sons. Firstly in order to chronicle
the exploits of my beloved Rifle
and Pistol Club (as y o u cannot fail
to have noticed) and secondly to
further my o w n selfish aims. A s an
example of the latter reason, I'd
just like to say that if anyone out
there fancies giving me a job,
they're more than w e l c o m e . I
won't insult your intelligence by
claiming to be hard working or
honest, but I a m desperate, and
I'll take almost anything.
But n o w I must come to the
end. It is time for me to bid y o u
adieu. A poignant m o m e n t
indeed. If I were a character from
Neighbours there would n o w fol-
low a montage sequence in which
important moments of my life are
briefly shown, accompanied by
some shockingly tacky piece of
'pop' music. Sadly I'm not a char-
acter from Neighbours, I'm a real
person, of sorts, but never mind.
I'd like to finish by thanking all
those w h o were kind enough to
aid me on my way, particularly my
collaborators Niall and David, not
to mention my friends w h o were
kind enough to p o p in and help.
I'd also like to thank all those w h o
contributed articles. M a y I say that
for the most part your articles
weren't g o o d as such but they
were at least lengthy. Jesus Christ
were they lengthy.
Goodbye forever
Jacob.
P.S. everything I've ever written
has been true.
