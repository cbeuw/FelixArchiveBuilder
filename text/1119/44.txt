PLAY REVIEWS
ARTS 24 June 1998
COPENHAGEN
Cottesloe Theatre, National Theatre
Yes, that's right fellow IC stu-
dents: a play (n. dramatic
piece or performance) about
Heisenberg. In a theatre on the
South Bank. At last - an arty farty
event which y o u can go to without
the risk of shedding your "boring,
apathetic scientist" label. O n the
evening I went the presence of a
large number of physicists in the
audience was indeed quite appar-
ent, but don't let that put y o u off.
Copenhagen is the new play by
Michael Frayn which concerns itself
with the meeting between
Heisenberg and Bohr in
Copenhagen during the autumn of
1941. What was actually said dur-
ing that visit and d o we really care?
in answer to the latter question,
the play's suggestion that this
meeting affected the course of his-
tory, in particular the effect on the
Nazis' atomic programme, should
arouse the curiosity of even that
mythical character known as the
Typical IC Student. Another reason
why y o u should be interested is
that the play deals with issues
which are directly concerned with
the consequences of what we all
do. A s well as raising such ethical
questions it also confronts the exis-
tential issues which concern Man's
place on this planet and what dri-
ves his pioneering spirit.
If it sounds like the play might
be quite intense at times then that's
because it is. There is no skirting
around or dumbing d o w n of the
science involved which makes me
w o n d e r h o w the non-scientists
found it. One's attention is con-
stantly engaged and, by the end, 1
felt mentally quite exhausted. This
is not only due to the dramatic and
intelligent text but the committed
and totally absorbing acting (Sara
Kestelman and David Burke as
Margrethe and Niels Bohr, and
M a t t h e w M a r s h as Werner
Heisenberg). Director M i c h a e l
Blakemore keeps it simple and
direct - for me, this is what theatre
is about.
So what exactly did happen
that evening in 1941? Perhaps we
shall never know. Michael Frayn
seems to exhaust all of the con-
ceivable possibilities during the
course of the play. Heisenberg and
Bohr themselves attempted to find
some c o m m o n ground in the mat-
ter during a later meeting in 1947
but, according to Heisenberg, " w e
both came to feel that it would be
better to stop disturbing the spirits
of the past." It is on this point that
Michael Frayn departs from the his-
torical record and in this meeting
they d o disturb them further. The
contempt with which Heisenberg
was treated after the war seems to
be a bit harsh since he faced a
dilemma in trying to explain his
actions: had he deliberately lost his
fellow-Germans the War and been
a traitor to the Nazis, or was he not
such a brilliant scientist after all and
truly believed that the building of a
nuclear b o m b w a s impractical?
Either way, he didn't end up with
the blood of many tens of thou-
sands on his hands.
The other factor raised by the
play is the extent to w h i c h
Heisenberg was aware of his o w n
intentions at the time. W h e n look-
ing into oneself one comes up
against limitations on what one can
observe and know; one then
becomes restricted in being able to
measure or judge accurately what
is going on. Rather like the theories
about the nature of scientific mea-
surement p r o p o s e d by certain
physicists earlier this century.

THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
Courtyard Theatre
As this is my first review, 1 felt
lucky that in my debut as a
"critic" (how grand!) I saw a
play that I enjoyed. I found the
treatment I received from the peo-
ple at the CourtYard so polite it
bordered on embarrassing. 1 was
spoken to individually, being told
that "the House is now open sir",
given a free drink and a whole
bunch of blurb about the cast. The
reason that this made me feel
oddly awkward was the fact that I
a m only a farty student w h o has
done a Theatre A level and a m now
damning or praising the extreme
hard work of twenty people as my
m o o d takes me. But, given that 1
a m a farty student, I will tell y o u
why 1 liked this play. (It had nothing
to d o with the free drink.)
The Taming O f The Shrew does
not hold dear to it's heart the ideas
of equality or even the slightest
respect for w o m e n , it was interest-
ing to observe how the production
coped with this problem of show-
ing a m o d e m audience ancient,
even offensive, ideals and ideas.
Their method was through a sub-
stantially adapted script, the work
of Phil Willmott. The character of
Petruchio, played by Dean
Moynihan, is an example of how
changed the play is - Petruchio
brags about the fact that he will
break the w o m e n w h o m no other
man is able to. Yet in this produc-
tion, he seemed to be less bragging
about his forthcoming conquest,
and more attempting to convince
himself that he had not bitten off
more than he can chew, giving the
play a more comic flavour. At the
finish, after m u c h sparring with
fierce Katherina, played by
Michaele Cussen, he manages to
obtain her affection. It always,
however, remains clear that he
respects her and she respects him.
In short this light adaptation was
fun, pacey and witty.
The Courtyard Theatre has a
lovely setting. The small theatre
opens out on to a courtyard (hence
the name) and its size and spacing
make the action intimate and
intense rather than in-your-face
and intimidating. The whole play
was set in front of a Cafe in rural
Padua, very realistically designed
and built. The costumes and props
were suitable and colourful.
The production never attempt-
ed to be more than it was, always
smoothing over what is a nasty
edge to the play. Some will argue
that the adaptations and modifica-
tions, w h i c h d i d fundamentally
alter the very essence of the play,
are not justified within the text. It
may be said that The Taming O f
The Shrew is either about the
breaking of the strong female or
nothing. 1 a m not approaching this
on literary grounds, whether or not
the adaptation was "artistically jus-
tified" (whatever that means), all 1
say is that it held my attention and
made me laugh; 1 never felt that it
was at all contrived. The company
grabbed hold of the play and kicked
it in to a shape acceptable to a
modern audience; a Fringe Theatre
recommendation.
The production had the kick
and spark which is only possible
when the cast are bouncing off
each other, communicating well
and having a great time. So if, like
me, you have ever had the yearning
in your heart to enter the unpre-
dictable, exotic world of drama and
sod the sensible science degree,
well be warned - seeing this will
make you wish that y o u had.

A CHORUS OF
DISAPPROVAL
Dramsoc
What I wanted to do, and
intended to d o , was
write a glowing review of
Dramsoc's excellent performance
of this play, slyly being rude about
the almost type-casting, and prais-
ing them to the skies in rose-tinted
prose. A whole page feature on
those talented and dedicated
actors, w h o also happen to be a
bunch of scientists and engineers,
complete with pictures and names
of the stars. What I end up doing,
however, is sitting at 8 p m on the
day before the entire paper's due
to be printed desperately trying to
fufill my promise in the two inches
of c o l u m n space I have left.
There's just enough r o o m to men-
tion my favourite m o m e n t s :
Daffydd and Raymond improvising
over the lighting, Bridget and Linda
half-killing each other over Crispin,
Enid's singing, the costumes, the
music, the set and the intentional-
ly(?) amateurish choreography.
Congratulations Dramsoc, it
was very g o o d , g o o d luck for next
time, and stop complaining, I
wrote you an embarrassingly gush-
ing preview.
