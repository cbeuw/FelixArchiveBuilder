N /ui campoeii s
uncovered the W o r l d Health
Organisation's cannabis cover-up.
Evil stuff, mate: I wouldn't touch it.

Felix was guilty of stating the obvi-
ous when an article o n page 2 enti-
tled " C C U s - N o b o d y Cares: It's
Official" utterly failed to raise any
eyebrows. Crap news of the week
was the death of Dermot M o r g a n ,
C4's Father Ted: a minute's silence
w a s held in the Felix office,
although that might just have been
because nobody could think of any-
thing to say.

Lingere
IC managed to bag more research
funding than any other university,
including O x f o r d or Cambridge,
begging the question: h o w m u c h
did this cost IC in bribes? Sherlock
Holmes was called in to examine a
case of blackmail as College
demanded 70% of the proceeds
from the walkway STA Travel shop:
Andrew Heeps described it as "the
worst day of my Presidency". Felix
suspects that he was just suffering
from a hangover. The ICU Football
team systematically trashed a
hotel, incurring ICU over a thou-
sand pounds in costs - apparently
this s u m included a bill for "an
entire silver cutlery set and a paint-
ing, which had been torn d o w n and
urinated over". Lovely. Other lovely
happenings included a vary fetch-
ing picture of one Anjit Chaudhari
on the walkway, dressed in lingerie
as a result of being snapped up at
the Rag Slave Auction.
Observant p e o p l e may have
noticed the spot above the T in
Felix....

Drugs ill
... leading to the shock arrest of
Felix editor Jeremy Thomson, w h o
was reported to have impregnated
each copy of Felix 1111 with LSD.
Luckily it turned out to be a hoax,
but this did not stop y o u gullible lot
handing in a large number of copies
of 1111 to Security. (Shame on
anyone w h o tried to ingest the
cover. You know w h o y o u are, you
pliable fools.) M o r e drug news this
week appeared in the shape of a
pro-cannabis march in Hyde Park:
various Felixers were present (pure-
ly for journalistic purposes, y o u
understand), but none of them
could remember what happened.

It transpired during the Easter holi-
days that there was "Trouble Ahead
for Campus Renaissance", describ-
ing delays in the construction of the
Â£ 5 8 m Biomedical Sciences build-
ing. Hands up all those w h o didn't
predict that anyway. Imperial also
managed to leap ahead of Oxford
in the Financial Times' University
Rankings, but I dare say there was
no criterion in the rating system
involving availability of w o m e n . O r
accommodation. Or, for that mat-
ter, quality of student newspaper.
Also occurring over Easter was
g o o d news for the medical schools'
bars: a private company stepped in
with a tender for both Charing
Cross and St. M a r y ' s , rescuing
them from an uncertain future. This
came just in time for the students,
w h o might otherwise had to have
contemplated a week at College,
sober.

Bomb Scare!
News this week was pitiful: the
best front page story w e could
manage was entitled: "IC Suffers
W o r s t Ever N e w s Drought".
Despite this, some amusing gub-
bins did occur; 1C Security, the
Bomb Squad and the police were
called in to defuse a b o m b in the
Sherfield Building, which may have
been placed to interfere with a
Biology final in the Great Hall. The
composition of the bomb was not
quite as chucklesome as last year's
effort: aluminium cans and foil
replaced the memorable overhead
projector scam.
A burglary attempt in Elec. Eng.
was thwarted, saving thousands of
pounds worth of computer equip-
ment, but I rather wish they had
stolen m y coursework before
escaping. M o r e important news
this week came in the shape of a
collection of possible cures for can-
cer (but don't start smoking yet,
kids.)

Put That Fag Out
A group of W a r d e n s and Sub-
Wardens put forward the proposal
that smoking should be banned
completely in all College resi-
dences. This really very cheeky sug-
gestion was treated with the con-
tempt it deserved - the campaign
failed. There was terrible news of
students being shot in Indonesia,
while campaigning for the resigna-
tion of President Suharto. Six were
killed. Think yourselves lucky.
Physicists might have been
interested in the story describing
how Australian astronomers had
discovered a supposed new black
hole. Let's hope they haven't made
a Hubble-type mistake, where the
scientists forgot to take off the lens
cap.

Resign
There was trouble all round this
week. Dave Wharton, DP F&S elect,
decided to resign his post due to
academic difficulties. The groans
around the Union were broken only
by the far-off chuckling from those
at St. M a r y ' s w h o v o t e d ' N e w
Election'. Bad news sprouted for
King's College, w h o s e Union
Manager was sacked for numerous
offences " i n c l u d i n g fraud and
drunken behaviour". This m a n
w o u l d probably fit in well in
America, where students staged
protests against alcohol bans, and
faced tear gas.
Other negative vibes included
the announcement of Tube strikes,
and worst of all, no Felix for two
weeks...

Noah's Hall
Another indication of the complete
lack of student interest in the run-
ning of the Union came to light
when the ICU A G M was terminated
by a shout of, " Q u o r u m ! " from
M e c h . Eng. student Andy Southern.
H e w a s s u p p o s e d l y protesting
about the lack of student interest at
the meeting, but I suspect he was
just clearing his throat.
There was more bad news for
Brabazon House, the Charing Cross
hall, w h e n rain flooded the base-
ment. (Why is it so hard to keep
water out? Why?!) This apparently
led to a scramble during which
people had to fill bags with their
possessions and take them upstairs
to the safety of dry land. It sounds
rather like a game show: anybody
fancy the licence?

It's This One
You're reading it. Errm... something
about STOIC being o n television.
This week, I did my laundry and
caught a horrible cough. Look, just
go read the news section, OK?
