NOT THE NEWS 24 June 1998
Even Numbers Outlawed
ROSS NEWELL
IC High Command has proposed a
plethora of radical cost-cutting
exercises including the outlawing of
even numbers.
The new ruling is causing a stir
all over the college. The new sys-
tem will replace the even digits,
including even digits in decimal
numbers, with the Greek letter
lambda (X). The ruling does not yet
cover 0, but this is likely to be
included in the next wave during
the summer. Thus the old digits 2,
4, 6, 8 will all be replaced by X, X,
X, X.
The decision comes after
Imperial again made a loss in the
2nd quarter. IC's share price fell by
almost 20% as confidence in the
college fell. This was compounded
by a rise in cost by the suppliers -
student prices have gone up by
£3.45 per kilogram over the past 3
months and prices are still rising.
The ICHC is considering only pur-
chasing 85% of the normal intake in
the coming year.
It is estimated that 15% of all
Imperial's academic spending (3%
of total spending) is on the use of
even numbers. The move has had
positive reactions from all over col-
lege. The Maths Department, rep-
resented by Mr C Broker of
Sherfield, said "We are really
pleased with the move, as it will
reduce our workload by X0%".
There was also a positive reception
from the Mechanical Engineering
department, represented by Mr C
Broker from Sherfield, who said
"This is great as all our plans auto-
matically convert themselves from
imperial units to metric... those
metric units always puzzled us". Mr
C Broker, speaking on behalf of the
Computing Department, comment-
ed "We only use zeros and ones
anyway".
However, despite the move
being officially approved by the
departments, there has been some
criticism by the Union. Miss D
Foster standing in for Mr C Broker
said "This is a big blow both for the
Union and for students generally.
Student grants have now
decreased by XXX. This will hit the
students hard. Where..." Mr C
Broker returned to relieve Miss D
Foster and carried on "The Union is
delighted by the decision and will
support ICHC all the way."

Sheep Maintenance Failing
Britain has a long and proud history
in sheep maintenance. As recently
as 1968, the world-leading compa-
nies were all based in the UK. Yet
foreign competition has caused the
practice to all but die out. Ross
Newell investigates...
Britain lags behind the world in
many ways, but none more so than
the vital area of Sheep
Maintenance. Britain, one of the
pioneers of this important area, has
neglected it for too long.
Sheep Maintenance in Britain
has a long history. The
Fundamental Principle of Sheep
Maintenance was developed at
Cambridge University by Sir Milford
Haven in 1902. Then in the 1970s,
when the world had all but forgot-
ten Shep Main, Margaret Terrace of
Imperial College laid down the
foundations for modern Shep Main
when she developed the now leg-
endary Terrace equation.
Shortly after this, however,
funding for Shep Main in Britain all
but disappeared. Why is it that
when Shep Main started to break
even, Britain ignored it? Why did
Britain look the other way when
Shep Main could be seen to be a
serious commercial venture? It
comes down to pride; the British
people think they are too good for
lowly Shep Main. Government and
Businesses see Shep Main as an
industry for inferior countries, but
can we afford to ignore an industry
with a turnover of £350 brillion per
annum?
Prejudice is not confined to
government and commercial inter-
ests; indeed, here at Imperial, a
Thanks to cuts and underfunding,
even prize young specimens like
these are being left to suffer rust-
ing, exhaust problems and
infrequent oil changes
place renowned for scientific indif-
ference (you know what I mean),
there is Shep Main prejudice. One
need only look at Imperial's
accounts to see that the Shep Main
department is seriously underfund-
ed. The budget for IC Shep Main
this year is only £4.32 and a
McDonald's voucher, whereas
Princeton USA Shep Main has a
budget of £25.3 quillion and its
own nuclear power station. We are
seeing the best British Shep Main
students head-hunted by foreign
universities. How are we supposed
to compete with Barcelona, whose
Shep Main Dept has a missile
launch centre and two Cray super-
computers, when our own has only
a box of soggy fireworks and a
Commodore 64 with a broken 't'
key?
The under investment in Britain
is not confined to Imperial,
Cambridge Shep Main has an
equally small budget and is forced
to use a bus shelter to lecture 1st
year students. This problem is
compounded by Simon Baker, who
uses the shelter to teach 40 five
year olds to read using yesterday's
copy of the Sun. Oxford Shep
Main, among others, has been
taken over by the mafia to be used
as a money laundering business.
This is one of the problems the
government should by tackling
head on. Will we stand aside and
let our ailing Shep Main industry
collapse or will we stand up and
fight back? The British Shep Main
industry needs your help.
You must stand up and say that
you appreciate their work. You
must buy British, even though
Japan makes higher quality prod-
ucts at lower prices, you must sup-
port the British economy. There is
still time to put Britain at the top of
the pack again, but time is running
out fast and the competition is
strong.

NEW MASCOT
ANNOUNCED
A new College initiative has
named serial killer Bob Goodwin
(34) as the new unified college
mascot. He will replace all the
CCU mascots to reduce costs.
Bob will attend college events
such as inter-university football
games and University Challenge
matches. He will offer moral
support, encouragement and
will execute any member of the
enemy/opposition who causes
an obstacle to IC's team's dom-
ination of the game/match/
world.
These rules are due to come
into effect at the start of next
term, but there is still time to
object to the proposals. Future
cuts oh the cards include a
reduction in the number of
allowable dimensions on cam-
pus, revoking Newton's 2nd
and 3rd laws, and eventual
relocation to Inverness of all
non-critical (academic) depart-
ments.
FOUL STENCH
Academic research was severely
affected on Friday, as a noxious
aroma drifted over the entirety
of the South Kensington, cam-
pus. Initially, it was believed
that the odour emanated from
the Chemistry department,
where certain members are
engaged in research into non-
aromatic hetereocycles, but this
proved to be false when the real
source of the smell was found
to be the RCSU office. When
questioned about the odour,
officers denied that it was their
fault, claiming that the recent
spell of hot weather had caused
the sewer system to overload.
When pressed, however, they
did admit to not having changed
their clothes for the past two
and a half years. Disgusted,
Security closed the office, and
began fumigation procedures.
The offending parties were sent
to St Mary's Hospital to have
their clothes surgically removed
and incinerated. Helen-Louise
Windsor is 35.
