Seba. Planetary Funk Alert (Looking
Good) Out Now
Another faultless piece of work
from the L o o k i n g G o o d c a m p ,
which is w h y it's no surprise that
it's been getting plenty of plays at
the Logical Progression parties
.sending the c r o w d into a frenzy
everywhere it's been d r o p p e d .
Absolutely killer key line in the
break and I can still hear Conrad's
lyrics floating over the top, hands in
the air stuff. A l s o featured o n
Bukem's Progression Sessions mix
CD. What more need 1 say, this is a
must.
Big Bud. Emotlonography (Good
Looking) Out Now
If you're a fan of previous Big
Bud releases this shouldn't be a
disappointment, as it's pretty much
in the same vein. With those famil-
iar crisp rolling beats, dubbed out
bassline and dreamy atmosphere-
icals and effects. Another one get-
ting m a x i m u m support from LTJ
himself, also featured o n his mix
CD. Just adding to the long list of
innovative and progressive tracks
that is G o o d Looking Records.
M.T.S Hard Disk /Revolution remix-
es (Juice) 13 Jury
Decoder gets o n the mix of
Hard Disk and gives it that distinc-
tive dark, fairly m i n i m a l rolling
treatment. Clashing beats injecting
in n o w and then over the drowning
bass tones and c h o p p e d up rolling
beats. But I actually prefer A-Sides
mix of Revolution which feels a lit-
tle harder, plenty of additional
beats thrown in over the main drum
pattern which keeps y o u interested
and clever fx and samples give it
the finishing touch.
Prisoners Of Technology. One Two
- World Cup Mix (Fresh Kuts)
Another t w o strong releases
from P.O.T, but I fail to see what it
has to d o with the World C u p ! They
keep surprising m e with the consis-
tent quality of the material released
to date, that fits neatly in between
Jump U p and more Intelligent and
Dark styles. Not a hint of cheese on
either track, as I keep expecting.
One Two is an intelligently made
fast paced track with clean crisp
beats and they show their diversity
as they dispense with the massive
bass-line and go with fucked with
effects. Top marks once again.
Low Down (Trouble On Vinyl)
This latest release has been a
while coming, the first since their
highly impressive album Code Of
The Streets. Echoing bass tones
sets up the break with eerie effects
and y o u expect it to drop like a
bomb but it doesn't. Instead it
c o m e s back with light, cleverly cut,
skippy beats that are constantly
building. Quite minimal really but
works very well the way the three
or so different beat patterns inter-
change.
Embee. Power (Splash) 6th Jury
A firm favourite with the likes of
Hype and Grooverider. A hectic
pace is set with Power, loads going
on, rough metallic beats sounding a
little like Babylon in the bassline
department if I'm not mistaken.
Damage has a wicked intro that
sounds like a laser pulse being fired
(Golden Eye N64?) then c o m e s in
the broken beats again fast and
furious and in an off beat stylee.
Fellowship. Mombassa / Quartz
(Creative Source)
In a very musical style that
Creative Source have been champi-
oning for some time now, strong
piano riffs run alongside quite a
hard sounding drum pattern with
little stabs of trumpet and flutes.
Definitely one for those long s u m -
mer nights ahead. Quartz is a little
harder and y o u could be mistaken
for thinking it was on G o o d Looking
records, it's in that sort of style.
Digital. Express (Creative Source)
Digital is one of my favourite
producers of the m o m e n t after a
string of wicked releases. This lat-
est offering is pretty minimal, with
intelligent use of the drum patterns
backed up by depth giving effects.
His fairly unique tight beats are dif-
ficult to explain, so I won't try. If
you're looking for something a little
different, it's well worth checking
out. Flip-side in a totally different
style reminiscent of one of
Decoder's dark rollers.
Breakbeat Era. Breakbeat Era (Full
Cycle/XL) 29 June
Breakbeat Era are Lennie Laws,
DJ Die and Roni Size and, as you
might expect, all these tracks are
breakbeat driven. The original mix
has a full song from Lennie Laws,
with a double bass. M o r e of a song
than a out and out Drum and Bass
track, very well done if you like that
sort of thing. The Full Cycle mix is
rather disappointing and feels very
weak overall. DJ Die mix is my
favourite, totally breakbeat driven
with double bassline, those full
cycle style beats. It gets a little
tinny for me, though.
1
Grant Nelson Project. Step 2 Me
(Swing City)
Out of the three mixes on offer,
I'd go for the Future Dub, which
totally cuts the vocal d o w n to little
stabs and starts off with a intro
taken from an old Drum and Bass
track, if I'm not mistaken. Slightly
overwhelming piano that, if it was-
n't cut out when it is, would sound
rather dodgy indeed, but they get
away with it. Nice scratch taking
y o u back into it. O n the first few lis-
tens I wasn't convinced by this
track but after repeated listening it
has grown on me, yet it still seems
to lack something. At the risk of
sounding sexist I'd say this was one
for the ladies, especially the full
vocal and two step mixes that have
a soul diva type of vocal.
Davis and Sweet. Muzik - Can u
Feel It (Weston Village) 3rd Jury
Title track Muzik has pretty sub-
tle beats and bass, relying on keys,
effects and title vocals to get y o u
moving, but feels a little weak and,
dare I say, boring. It keeps threat-
ening to do something to spark it
off but never does. But I've a feel-
ing it's meant to be this way, an
easy going roller. Destiny is more
lively due to tougher beats again,
pleasant key interchanges and
g o o d mix of the two vocals working
hand in hand. This one has that lit-
tle something that grabs your atten-
tion and gets y o u moving.
Pursernel and Sons. Ain't What You
Do (Swing City) 3 Jury
Slightly dubious vocal that lets
this track d o w n for me, as clever
beats and mid bass tones are quite
effective but always feeling a little
mainstream for me. But then Swing
City d o seem to nestle between out
and out underground garage and
more vocal, classic garage. Grant's
Deep and Deadly mix has to be my
favourite, chunky beats and he
manages to make the vocal sound
all right via cutting the fuck out of it.
I wouldn't call this a blinding track
but it's O K .
The Memzee. Funky Love (Vinyl
Distribution) Out Now
This has to be one of the best
tracks I've had sent through this
year and I haven't stopped playing
it. A n d I actually prefer the vocal
mix to the dub (that is a first), with
the amazing vocal talents of The
M e m z e e are unreal. Right up there
with Roy Davis Jnr's Gabrielle for
vocal content but m u c h m o r e
danceable and club friendly. Not so
much tuff beats but percussion and
off key piano tones get you groov-
ing. W i c k e d track perfect for the
summer months ahead.
Pob. Boiler (Platipus) Out Soon
This hard in your face tech-
house sort of stuff, with trancey
tinges a n d contains all your
favourite animal sounds, honestly it
does. Getting plenty of support
from the likes of Sasha, Oakenfold
and Nick Warren to mention but a
few. it's deep, hard, trippy and well
put together: all in all a fierce track.
Also a remix by Humate, w h o mini-
malises the beats action and dark-
ens it up s o m e in a typical German
trancey style.
Conscious. Northern Lights
(Platipus) Out Soon
Original mix has massive intro
of atmosphereicals, effects, bird
calls - very deep and dreamy then
eventually the bass drum rolls in
with skippy percussion lines. A
pleasant trancey number in a rolling
fashion. P o d mix is hard house bor-
dering on funky Techno, starts off
with jungle animal s o u n d s .
Squelchey beats and a driven bass
drum accompanied by wobbly acid
sounds that mess with your mind
as it keeps building. Sure to keep
any floor pumping.
Don't forget all the singles fea-
tured here are based o n 12" Vinyl
not C D releases and many will only
be available in small independent
records shops not the large chain
stores. Also the release dates are
just a rough guide as many are put
back, brought forward etc. Even
though this is often the case there
are always a few p r o m o copies
floating around well before official
release dates.
