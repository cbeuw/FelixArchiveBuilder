24 June 1998 TWO SHORT STORIES 55
" G o s h , " he increased his stoop and pressed
his face towards the screen. " A n d y o u say y o u
can write on it."
"You can indeed, Sir."
The man tapped a finger tentatively towards
it, pressing a key. The music stopped.
" O h G o d , " the man m o c k e d with a forced
levity, "I hope I haven't broken it." M r Skanket
played along,
" O h no sir, here." The music started.
"And how m u c h was it?" A note of cunning
in the voice now,
M r Skanket took up a large calculator that
inhabited his bench and typed numbers into it.
"I'm in a g o o d m o o d today. It's Christmas after
all." H e caught the customers eye. "With the
CD R O M and disks £ 1 3 5 0 . Cash, excluding
VAT."
The old man looked at his hands. "I'll give
you £ 1 0 0 0 . A n d y o u can keep those." H e
pointed to the disks. The store keeper looked
heavenward. " O n e thousand. It cost me more
than that. M y lowest offer £ 1 2 5 0 , that's £ 1 0 0
off."
The man reached into his top pocket and
quickly pulled out his wallet. With the grim
smile of one w h o has w o n a battle of wills, hard
fought.
"Twelve hundred and fifty it is then, d o y o u
accept cheques?"
The nod was to the ascent. The frail man
laboured over the writing, ending in a clear
prestigious M r Locker.
"I'm afraid I don't have a bank card, will an
address d o ? "
" O f course, of course. N o w y o u must be
getting o n . " M r Skanket looked at his watch
sternly. "Look at the time." M r Locker after his
moment of glory shrunk back into his shell.
"Yes, yes. I'm so sorry."
"Sure, sure, let me help y o u with these."
The storekeeper piled the equipment back
in its boxes, remembering the disks but forget-
ting to put the discman in. H e handed M r
Locker the pile and bundled him out towards
the door.
So when M r Locker left the shop. Laden so
high with boxes he could hardly see the path he
walking on. H e was wearing a strange smile, a
look even of deep satisfaction. Perhaps it was
brought o n by a sudden infusion of Yule tide
spirit, or perhaps the simple pleasure of seeing
children play brought back memories of his
youth. But had M r Skanket seen it he would
have detected something else there, something
else entirely.
The ball whistled through the air and hit M r
Locker squarely on the top of his bald head.
But he always knew it, like the cheque,
would bounce.
f f w t's all a complete disaster." I'm bel-
j lowing hysterically d o w n the phone.
Bridget's conciliatory. "Its not that bad.
Nothing that happens to y o u it is THAT bad."
"It is. A n d it's worse." I exclaim wildly.
"She hates me and with g o o d reason. She
hates me cos I'm stupid and cos I'm a crap
shag."
I pause. This is out of control.
"You had one bad session. So what it hap-
pens, it happens all the time. It's happened to
me often enough. Perhaps y o u just don't fancy
her.
G o d my sister's stupid; I should never take
any problems to her. She always has a really
obvious explanation that leaves me feeling
trivial and silly. O r worse she just tells me
something a hundred times worse that hap-
pened to her the day before. Don't get me
wrong, I mean I love her to death and every-
thing. It's just I don't want solutions. 1 just
want some sympathy and for her to tell me I'm
wonderful and everyone else sucks.
"Maybe I'm gay," I suggest. That should
mix it up a bit. "That's why I haven't had sex
for ages, and w h e n I d o I don't c o m e and then
wish I hadn't bothered."
"Tom y o u haven't had a ride for yonks cos
y o u never meet any w o m e n and you had a
crap shag cos your willy's been out of use for
so long it's probably forgotten what it's there
for. It probably thinks its a carrying handle, or
a pink banana. Or a loofer."
" A loofer?"
"Ok, forget the loofer bit."
N o w she was enjoying this. Christ I ask for
sympathy and just become the centre of
amusement.
" O h , its ok for y o u to laugh. You're a girl,
y o u can have sex whenever y o u want to. A n d
y o u don't even have to d o any thing . You just
lie there."
"That the case is it? W h o ' v e y o u been
sleeping with?"
"Bugger off, y o u know what I mean. "
Bitch. I hate her.
Before y o u get all weird on me and think
I'm a social deviant I'd better explain. This is
normal activity for me a n d Brigit.
We're the two youngest in a family of
four and having been despised by my t w o
older and eviller sisters - from which we stole
the limelight, inheritance, chocolate biscuits
from -has pretty m u c h made us into soul
mates.
I can't talk to my parents about sex. D a d
never even got as far as to tell me about the
birds and the bees. I don't quite know why
not. M a y b e he was shy, more likely he just for-
got. H e probably realised I'd get m u c h more
intimate knowledge than he could provide,
courtesy M r Heffner. I certainly can't talk to
my friends. They just give advice o n the basis
for the size of her cleavage. Anything less than
34C. Whatever it is she's done (taken me to
Paris, bought me a car), it was unforgivable
and she should be dispatched on the first train
to let's-be-friends land. If they're bigger than a
double D she's wonderful and I should put up
with anything and everything. Then go shag
her. So Bridget was my only source of sympa-
thy, sort of.
"Tom she sounds nice. W h y don't talk to
her about it, let her know your worried." "Yeah
great idea 'Hey, Rachael. Shagging y o u was a
bit crap the other night. I was thinking it was
because I don't fancy y o u that m u c h . What d o
y o u think?' Slap, d u m p . "
"If you're so smart why ask me anything?"
"Why indeed you big d u m b arse?"
"Look don't get arsy with me, just because
you can't perform in the sack"
"Yeah, just because I don't spend my
whole time horizontal surfing with every dolt I
meet."
"You just wish you d i d " Double bitch, she
had an answer for everything
"Ok, ok. I'll just end it. Say I need to spend
some time by myself. O r alternatively I could
take sex lessons."
"You can have sex lessons? Fine take them,
just stop wingeing so m u c h . I'm going. See
you adopted one."
"See y o u drunken mistake"
A n d people ask me w h y my love life's on
the rocks.
