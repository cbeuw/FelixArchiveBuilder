S u m m e r Ball Success
ALAN CEER AND JULIA HARRIES
The first ever Imperial College
Summer Ball was held on Friday 19
of June at Alexandra Palace, and
proved to be an unprecedented
success. The event, which sold out
several weeks ago, was attended
by over a thousand people. Apart
from only seven coaches turning up
to take people to the Ball and the
ridiculously small numbers of bar
staff, the Ball was enjoyed by all.
Organisers had not planned on
apathetic IC students wanting to
dance, or even wanting to come,
but in the event the dance floor
became too crowded. Johnny Ball,
after consuming several bottles of
wine, gave an immensly popular
speech, and although only some
revellers could hear him, he
received a standing ovation.
Exuberant and very drunk stu-
dents including Andy Heeps, 32,
were forced to find other avenues
of amusement. Luckily with
dodgems, a casino and the karaoke
machine, no one would have
noticed Mr. Heeps' hairy buttocks.
Amazing lighting effects and the
uncharacteristically friendly atmos-
phere made a complete change
from Union carnivals. The groovy
crowds partied until they were
finally forced out in the early hours
by weary Ally Pally staff. It looks like
the Imperial Ball is here to stay,
make sure you get your tickets
early next year.

Print Unit's Last Impression
JEREMY THOMSON
After nearly twenty years, 1CU Print
Unit is set to close. The printshop,
which is thought to be the only in-
house union printing facility in the
country received its death-knell
from a unanimous vote from an
emergency ICU council last Friday.
The print unit was founded by
Felix in order to provide cheap, fast
newspaper printing. It continued
for many years, growing larger and
undertaking jobs for clubs and
other organisations. It was run
under the management of subse-
quent Felix editors, until a decision
was made in 1995 to expand it into
a full trading outlet.
Over the last two years, howev-
er, the unit has run into problems.
Firstly, the space occupied by the
print unit is required for the exten-
sion of dBs taking place this sum-
mer, and no provision for new
space has been confirmed by col-
lege. Problems have also been
encountered in training students to
print, and lack of profits have ruled
out a full-time professional printer.
Concern about the newly revealed
financial performance of the print
unit and the need for major invest-
ment brought matters to a head.
Further bad news came from the
print unit manager, who revealed
that he was considering retirement
at the end of this year.
Several options were consid-
ered by council, including expand-
ing the unit, switching to new print-
ing technology or handing control
of the print shop back to Felix, the
option favoured by the current Felix
editor. In the end, however, it was
decided to give all jobs to external
printing companies and pull the
plug.
The equipment owned by the
print unit is being sold, and the pro-
ceeds are currently set to fund the
'Animal House' - the new ICU
media centre to be built in the west
wing basement of Beit Quad next
year. Felix itself looks likely to be
produced by East End Offset in
Bow, who have also printed this
issue.
Concern was raised by both the
Felix Editor and the editor elect, Ed
Sexton, over the timing of Felix pro-
duction. The current tradition of a
Friday release would prevent up-to
date news coverage, and would
delay sports reporting by at least a
week. "We will have to seriously
consider whether it is worth contin-
uing as a weekly publication", said
Ed Sexton. "The Print Unit was cre-
ated by Felix, for Felix", explained
current editor Jeremy Thomson,
"We are facing problems, but not
insurmountable ones. I think it is a
great shame that, because the
union has been able to develop the
Print Shop into a trading outlet,
they have simply closed it."
However, the discussions
remained diplomatic, with Andy
Heeps recognising the origin of the
print shop; "I think that there is a
strong argument that Felix should
receive the majority of the pro-
ceeds from the closure - though
it's all union money in the end", he
said. The Print Unit Manager, Andy
Thompson, also seemed resigned
to the fate of the printshop;
"Obviously, my initial reaction was
one of disappointment, that the
union's development of dBs failed
to take into account the require-
ments of its Print Unit. However,
the print industry is fast-changing
and without major investment in
not only equipment, but also staff,
we could never hope to compete.
Futhermore, if the Print Unit were
to succeed as a trading outlet by
taking on major accounts, this
would be to the detriment of the
union's clubs and societies, which
to my mind would be a confict of
interest."
