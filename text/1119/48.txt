54 TWO SHORT STORIES 24 June 1998
T
w o kids were playing with a rub-
ber ball. They were standing out-
side a hi-fi shop, it was winter,
cold &. crisp, usual winter stuff. O n e of the kids
caught the ball and threw it hard at the ground
towards his friend. H e was on the pavement and
it was frozen solid, the ball bounced high off the
sheet black ice, across the front of the shop.
The shop was like many of the breed scat-
tered around L o n d o n . Small, cramped but well
lit and with enough stock to fill a supermarket.
A n d it was by supermarket rules it operated,
well the cheap ones anyway. The owner was a
M r Skanket. A short, brown fat man. Dark eyes,
piercing, no bullshit sort. H e knew almost noth-
ing about hi-fis, in fact before c o m i n g into o w n -
ership of this property he worked selling win-
dows, which he was equally g o o d at. What he
really knew about was people, he knew, as y o u
say, what makes them tick. Particularly
he knew about the English. The English he
loved, he might have been English him-
self or Asian, it didn't matter. H e was a
different breed. What he loved about the
English and particularly the older 'more
English' generation was their politeness,
their manners and their mannerisms. A n
Englishman if he is a gentleman can't say
'bullshit' w h e n y o u tell him some second
rate piece of junk , second hand in a car
boot sale is the latest technology. A n
Englishman will say 'really, is that so?'
and d o his best to believe. H e knows he's
being ripped off, he knows y o u are going
as slowly as possible, making him waste
your time, but to contradict y o u would be
impolite. It would break that code which
he hangs his whole life o n . If y o u swear,
say 'shit' or 'fuck' or even 'you stupid
arse wipe, get a life, go get laid, d o
something. For fucks sake stop pretend-
ing you're so g o d d a m n e d self con-
trolled.' He'll say 'Hold o n a minute,
don't you dare use that sort of language
on me'. A n d storm out. However play by
the rules, loosely maybe but go by them and
you'll be fine. Fine, fine, fine.
So it was unsurprising when the middle
aged, weather beaten, pink, thin to the point of
wasted, balding with white hair swept across,
half m o o n e d glasses, old tweed suited man
peered through the glass, M r Skanket w a s
pleased to see him. M r Skanket showed his
gratitude by starting to scribble numbers on a
pad in front of him. The bell rang loudly and M r
Skanket looked up. The man looked from the
open door, into the shopkeepers eyes, for a full
half second and then quickly looked d o w n .
Embarrassed he started to work his way around
the shop. There wasn't far to go so the shop-
keeper waited for the inevitable. The man
looked up, perhaps to see some of the products
more than a foot above the ground, but he
looked up and caught M r Skanket's eye. Both of
them.
"Can I help y o u sir?" H e put d o w n the
papers firmly.
"Err. Well. Yes... U m . 1 hope that y o u can d o
that" he laboured it out. Tittering nervously at
the end. M r Skanket answered fiercely,
" D o what? What can I d o for you?" This
threw the customer. H e wasn't that old, maybe
senility struck early in his family. H e tittered
again. Then with another burst of courage,
"It's for my sister, she writes p o e m s and I'm
looking for an organiser for her. A n electronic
one, not too expensive... " H e trailed off into
silence. The store keeper got off his stool and
walked stiffly around the counter.
"I show y o u what I have got."
He passed close to the customer, standing
by each other the old man despite his stoop
stood a g o o d foot taller. Inspite of this he
seemed to have no presence at all. To hardly
take up any r o o m in the shop. H e shuffled mis-
wide screen, W i n d o w s . " The customer frowned
and made a weak attempt at looking stern.
"This isn't right, I need an organiser. A n d
would y o u kindly sell me one or 1 will leave the
shop." M r Skanket looked tired.
"This is an organiser. See." With a fat finger
he typed ' W I N ' onto the screen. W i n d o w s duly
appeared.
" N o w , put your finger on the pad and move
the pointer here." The man looked red but put a
thin finger onto the black roller pad. The store
keeper clicked the button for him and some
organiser program was loaded.
"There, see." The customer muttered mute-
ly but M r Skanket was not going to be stopped
now,
"You say your sister writer poetry, well look.
Look." H e loaded the w o r d processor. " M o d e r n
technology. Isn't it wonderful."
"That it maybe," the victim muttered, "but
h o w a m I to afford it?"
"You want to know the price?"
"Yes. That would be g o o d of y o u . "
M r Skanket ignored the answer
and looked into the box. "Let m e
show y o u this first. With it y o u get
this." H e pulled out an instruction
manual. "I give this to y o u free, oth-
ers wouldn't. I do. A n d this, here is
the battery, 'long lasting' a special
m o d e l . "
erably as M r Skanket rolled around him and bent
d o w n to open one of the glass cases. He
reached inside and pulled out a large box from
many stacked in a helter-skelter pattern, giving
the impression of a monkey's attempt at Tetris.
He laboured the box back across the shop to his
desk. The retch shuffled around keeping his
eyes on the proprietor at all times.
"Here, this is what 1 have for y o u " , he said
shaking the personal computer from its foam
prison. The man stammered,
"I'm not sure you understand me, that's far
too m u c h . "
"This! This. Too m u c h . Let me s h o w y o u . "
The old man opened his mouth to protest, then
closed it again.
The store keeper found the catch and
opened the lid of the lap top. The thing came on
with a bleep. N o doubt surprising both m e n
equally. H e turned the machine so it faced the
shrinking customer on the other side of the
desk.
"Here." H e read from the box. "Personal
computerised, Pentium processor, 60 M H z ,
The man looked away, perhaps
for means of escape. H e looked at his
watch.
"For y o u 1200 p o u n d s . " The
blotchy man looked d o w n and half
stepped away.
"I really must be going now. Its
late and surely y o u should shut your
shop."
"I keep it open for y o u . 1200
pounds. What is wrong? Is it the
price?" But the man dragged himself
away. "I must go."
"Just tell me. You don't like the
price?"
The man shuffled a bit. "It is rather a lot."
"I tell y o u what." H e picked a box of disks
off the counter. "I give y o u these. I throw them
in. Worth 20 pounds. Buy today. I'm in a g o o d
m o o d . I give y o u 10% off too, £ 1 0 0 0 . H o w
about it?" The man returned to the counter.
"It's really too much. I'm not a wealthy
m a n . "
"Well maybe we can make a deal. It's too
much y o u say. Your sister like music. See, C D
R O M attachment. It can play music."
"She loves music."
"You want a C D R O M . I get y o u one" H e
walked purposely across the shop and returned
with another box. " C D R O M normally £ 5 0 0
pounds, with the computer only £ 2 0 0 . "
The customer watched, almost rooted to
the spot, while the charade of setting up the
diskman took place. M r Skanket pressed play
and tinny Strauss floated out of the machine and
across the s h o p . The m a n was visibly
impressed.
