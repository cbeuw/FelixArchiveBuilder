PC 2D & 3D GRAPHICS HARDWARE
VIPER 330
Diamond Multimedia, £69 it it it-k
In the dark distant past PCs
bleeped their way through low-res-
olution games. First the soundcard
removed the bleeping and added
F M music; millions of soundcards
were then sold. Next high resolu-
tion graphics cards allowed us to
play games with decent graphics.
N o w the 3D accelerated graphics
card seem to be following the same
path as games start to d e m a n d a
3D card. These graphics cards
come in two main groups, the pure
3D accelerator cards and the more
general 2D/3D cards. The differ-
ence between the two groups can
generally be compared to the dif-
ference between owning a sports
car or a hot hatchback. Everyone
knows that a sports car will gener-
ally beat the hatchback, but the
hatchback is something y o u can
use everyday. So hatchback test
number one, the Viper 330. Is it
Peugeot 306 Gti or M G metro
turbo?

GAME REVIEW
MEN IN BLACK
SouthPeak Interactive,
PC / Playstation DO StdTS
With, I believe, the slimmest
exceptions of Batman, Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade and
the o d d Star Wars titles, games
under film licences are unadulter-
ated, indefensible slurry. Et, quelle
surprise, here w e are with M e n in
Black. M a y b e this would be the
one? The mould breaker? Could
Southpeak Interactive be the ones
to pull M e n in Black out of the
cesspool? Well, no.
It all looked bad from the start;
very slick menu system, expensive
TV adverts, M i B cartoon influences
in the intro sequence; just not
what y o u ' d want. A n d then the
game. You (Will Smith) investigate
a break-in a N e w York apartment
building. At least y o u do when y o u
persuade your at fuck-utterly badly
animated irritation of a character
to point in the right direction at the
door handle. Progressing through
the door, y o u are greeted by the
piss-poor sample "Som'in tells me
this mus' be da place". A n d that is
the best in the game. The objec-
tive, I learn, is to kill the baddies
and disarm the bomb. A h yes, a
fight scene. I was looking forward
128bit NVIDIA Riva 128 with a 230
M H z R A M D A C - impressive speci-
fications. The 4 M B o n b o a r d
memory allows y o u to run resolu-
tions of 1 6 0 0 x 1 2 0 0 at 6 5 , 0 0 0
colours at a high refresh rates
8 5 H z . The 2 D performance is not
especially fast compared for 2 D
cards. However, PC Magazine's
tests showed that it is within 12%
of the 2D/3D leader, the Matrox
Millenium II.
This card though is not opti-
mized for the graphical "school run
and shopping trip" but it is the 3D
performance where the card is seri-
ously g o o d . The image quality is
almost up to 3Dfx level (the current
top sportster) and though there
were the o d d incorrect polygon
clipping errors, they were not
enough to irritate. It doesn't sup-
port Glide (the low-level interface
supported by 3Dfx cards and used
in many games) but is able to run
some openGL (ie. quake) and all
DirectX (ie. Tomb raider 2) games,
to this. There are two ways of
scrapping, both dreadful to con-
trol, one being 'stand still and kick
them in the shins until they die'
and the other being shooting them
from long range (you miss from
anything shorter then about six
feet). Enemies have no intelligence
whatsoever, running straight
towards y o u and crouching,
punching badly in the direction
they crouched in, allowing even
the least experienced gamer to run
behind them and boot them up the
arse. The animation - mentioned
before - is astonishingly bad. W h e n
the character jumps it is an undis-
guised rehash of the walking
and run them at speed. Even on a
Pentium 120 resolution changes
didn't really compromise the high
frame rates. Tomb Raider 2 was
tested using resolutions from
3 2 0 x 2 0 0 to 800x600.
Where the Viper 330 has a real
edge is in price. At the s u b - £ 1 0 0
level it beats the other 2D/3D cards
hands d o w n , makin it an affordable
hot hatchback. At this price it also
competes against the older pure
3D cards. Here the car analogy is
back again - while everyone would
love a sports car on their drive
sometimes your head has to rule
your heart and you buy the hot-
hatch because it is almost perfect.
Anyway y o u can always buy that
sports car later and so too with the
pure 3D card.

animation m o v e d linearly upwards
then d o w n w a r d s , with normal
gravitic motion effects abandoned
mercilessly. M a k i n g use of any-
thing requires c a m p arm-waving
for several seconds in the vague
direction of the object like Kenneth
Williams chastising a small child
with a light slap around the ear.
But less funny. The puzzles are not
even slightly challenging, relying
exclusively on a drab combination
of tricks and oh-so obvious clues,
and suffering from the dreaded
find-the-pixel disease. I'm afraid
that seemed incurable. The inten-
tional "humour" is stretched at
best, the unintentional more so

TREASURES
OF THE DEEP
Namco, Playstation it it it it
Diving suits, sharks, submarines
and really excellent 3D graphics.
Treasures from the D e e p has
pretty much everything including
excellent strategy/action game-
play. As a navy seal y o u have to
complete a series of missions
from the shallows of the
Caribbean using wet suits and
chariots to the deep sea antics of
the Arctic oceans. Fortunately
decompression sickness is not a
feature as y o u soon afford proper
subs. Against y o u , the denizens of
| the deep, along with an army of
divers and their submarines. O n
your side your basic w e a p o n , a
spear gun might seem a bit wet,
but soon y o u will be buying nets,
torpedoes and homing missiles to
even the odds. Take too many tor-
pedoes or air though and you
have no extra capacity for bonus
treasure found near wrecks but
take too little and y o u are shark
bait. The graphics are crisp, and
the distance fogging removes
most of the nasty p o p - u p events.
The fish and sharks also show
some intelligence (or lack of it).
Fish tend to mind their o w n busi-
ness while sharks are attracted by
blood - either yours or someone
else's. So d o n the wet suit and
snare, shoot and m a i m but avoid
the endangered species because
they're not big or clever.

after the first couple of glitches. To
give a little bit of credit, the art-
work on the backgrounds was well
executed, notably the competent
and stylish vistas and movie-faith-
ful attention to detail. The point of
view, a Resident Evil style third
perspective was a g o o d idea for
the game, but the effect was
spoiled by slightly obtuse camera
angles. You can change characters
once you've completed the first
level and are indoctrinated in the
M i B , but it doesn't change the
gameplay a touch. You are still a
badly animated, witless and infuri-
atingly stupid figure, be y o u a thin
black man (Smith), a stocky white
man (Tommy Lee Jones), or a
poorly pixelated and overly wide
female (apparently Linda
Fiorentino).
A c o m p l e t e waste of time,
money and licence. Arse, arse,
