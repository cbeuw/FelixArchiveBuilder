A
nother year, another editor,
and another group of stories
produced by the combined
efforts of a new government, an old
ICU President, various Acts of G o d ,
and a gaggle of over-excited sci-
ence, technology and medicine
students. For those of y o u w h o
spent the whole year in bed, had a
permanent hangover, or decided to
go to France instead, w e tell y o u
what happened, how it happened,
and w h o was c o m p r o m i s e d in the
process...

Flood
You would think that it was reason-
ably possible, given the w h o l e
sphere of human knowledge, to
keep water flowing where it is sup-
posed to be. H o w hard can it be to
create a pipe that will not burst?
Quite tricky for Southside Hall,
apparently, w h o experienced
something of a rupture in their
plumbing on the 7 September. The
resultant cascade of this Water of
Life affected most of the hall's
staircases and forced the Linstead
housekeeper, Sheena M c D o n a g h ,
to spend her evening in a less inter-
esting way than she had planned.
Already slightly anxious freshers
may have become even more con-
cerned upon seeing Felix's front
page depicting the introduction of
security dogs o n the South
Kensington campus, presumably to
fight off the crack, organised, crim-
inal squad of muggers, drug dealers
and con-artists that patrol Imperial
College both night and day. O n e
problem with which these canine
policemen seemed unable to deal
was the spontaneous combustion
of the Sherfield cash machine, sup-
posedly caused by a malfunctioning
receipt printer. Mulder and Scully
were subsequently called in; Beavis
and Butt-head were held for ques-
tioning, after witnesses spotted
them trashing the Sherfield coffee
stall.

Homeless
M o r e concern for newly-arrived IC
students, upon noticing that one of
the Halls of Residence was falling
to pieces. Luckily it transpired that
only an ornamental section of
Garden Hall's "dental course" had
collapsed, and the rest of the block
was described as "[being] in an
acceptably safe condition". This did
not help ICU President Eric Allsop,
who failed to be anywhere near the
masonry w h e n it fell, and hence
was not put out of his fifteen-
month Presidential misery.
It was just as well that our exist-
ing Halls were managing to stand
the test of time, though, given the
other front-page article this week,
"IC A c c o m m o d a t i o n at Crisis
Point", describing the heart-
wrenching story of students having
to live in Clayponds rather than in
nice local halls. Spare a thought for
the p e o p l e sleeping on the
Embankment: I read a story once
about a student w h o spent two
years in a tent. I a m also rather sur-
prised that we did not end up run-
ning a story: "Three hundred IC
freshers have resigned from their
courses after worries about crime
on-campus" alongside the pieces
entitled "Clayponds Thefts Restart"
and "Equipment Nicked", and a
potential alcoholic catastrophe: the
U n i o n ' s trouble in obtaining a
Public Entertainment Licence.

Poison Gas
Skipping high over Issue 1094,
which seems to have been erased
f r o m history, w e discover that
"Physics Leaks Deadly Fluorine":
although not very often, thankfully -
this was caused by three disused
cylinders of the gas waiting to be
chucked out. There were also c o m -
plaints by IC's Safety Officer that
members of staff had been seen
gazing out of windows while the
alarm was raised all around them.
Perhaps they were attempting to

stay as far as possible away from
Southside Bar, which saw the first
of its many brawls this week.

Let's Get Sued
The front page story outlined IC's
plans to build its o w n power sta-
tion, apparently churning out
3 . 8 7 5 M W - note that this is still
only 0.32% of the 1.21 GigaWatts
required to help out a trapped
Marty McFly. Cases of meningitis
w a s o n c e m o r e reported at a
harassed Cardiff University, and
there was seemingly some afflic-
tion at the Felix office as well - pub-
lished in this issue was the infa-
mous story about the Conference
Centre which cost the editor valu-
able apology space for the next two
issues. It was either that, or get
sued. Other bad news: Blunkett's
tuition fee suggestion raised its
ugly head for the first of many
occasions here, with the news that
thousands of prospective students
were being discouraged from
attending University by the financial
pressure involved. It was probably
also about this time that A n d r e w
Heeps (not President yet, r e m e m -
ber) formulated his cheesy "ability
to learn rather than ability to earn"
quip. A future in the House of
Lords beckons, surely.

Bones
O n e of two news stories written by
yours truly this year was embla-
z o n e d in glorious technicolour
(well, orange and black) across the
front page of an issue w h o s e
design was described as both "vile"
and "great" in subsequent letters
pages. This superbly written slice of
polychromatic drivel detailed a
march in protest against the intro-
duction of tuition fees. A photo-
graph taken at the march depicted
the two new ICU Presidential can-
didates being overshadowed by a
skeleton - could it have been the
ghost of N e w Election? Another
pipe burst this week, m u c h to the
amusement of anyone not doing
Mechanical Engineering: a steam
pipe o n the fifth floor of the build-
ing took it upon itself to cancel a
few lectures, a n d create an
impromptu sauna.
There were also the hustings for
the jobs of DP(C&S) and ICU
President, although many would
rather have seen it as a vote decid-

ing whether Eric Allsop should be
let out of his cell after fifteen
months.

Rag Mag Slagged
D e m o c r a c y d e c i d e d that Allsop
should indeed be returned to the
wild, as Charlie Joynt and Andrew
Heeps were selected to climb up
the ziggurat of c o m m a n d by those
voters that did leave their beds.
The defeated Presidential candi-
date was M a r k Baker, and may I
say that he has not stopped whin-
ing about the kitchen sink since.
There were chuckles all round at
