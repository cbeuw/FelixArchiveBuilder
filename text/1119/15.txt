24 June 1998 NEWS REVIEW 15
the unfortunate Norris McWhirter,
w h o had a slight accident with the
barrier in the IC car park resulting in
his teeth being "damaged". H m m .
Rag also suffered a setback w h e n
their magazine came under heavy
criticism for containing jokes of an
"unacceptably racist and h o m o -
phobic" nature. N o change there,
then.

Moaning Witch
It couldn't be long before whispers
of IC sports teams and their
destructive capabilities began to fil-
ter through into the office. This
week, the first of these incidents
was given the glory of the front
page: s e e m s the football team
(ICUAFC) got a bit t o o r o w d y
somewhere along their " H a m m y
Ten" pub crawl. O n e of the pubs'
staff described the t e a m as
"extremely obnoxious" - surely he
was mistaken? Also on the front
page was the news that Sir Patrick
M a y h e w had come to educate the
impressionable ConSoc flock; he
w a s q u o t e d as saying that he
"deserved an Oscar". W e pause to
consider the quantity of legislation
required to award all Conservative
M P s an Oscar at the ceremony
before g o i n g h o m e for s o m e
cannabis ... news. Readers will have
either smiled or frowned at the
blocks of hashish-based enlighten-
ment which have dropped from the
purple haze this year, but a small
article heralding B M A observations
concerning use of cannabis for
medical purposes d i d appear with
the most excellent headline: " B M A
Deals Blow to Anti-Drugs Lobby".
Nice one, Features Editor.
O t h e r w i s e , the careers fair
received record turnout, and
Helen-Louise Windsor was award-
ed the post of RCSU President.
Lucky her.

Computer Sex
The Principal Sheaf of the Students'
Newspaper at Imperial College was
the site of mixed fortunes on this
particular Friday morning. Firstly
there were the Praed Street rapes
(bad news; on this w e shall not
dwell) followed by news of a sec-
ond large demonstration against
tuition fees (good news. Why, I'd
s h o w the bloody government a
thing or two if I could just get out of
this chair.)
G o o d news for excitable and
sex-starved c o m p u t i n g students
this week w a s that D O C were
receiving a Fujitsu A P 3 0 0 0 comput-
er. This was (and with luck, still is)
equipped with the following attrib-
utes: eighty nodes, 12.5 Gb of
memory, 336 Gb of internal drive
space and a theoretical peak per-
formance of 45.6 Gigaflops.
(Steady, now.) O h , and the
Chemistry undergraduate c o m m o n
r o o m was closed: presumably the
space was needed for storing more
chemicals for fabricating drugs and
explosives.

Bang!
You were no decent student if y o u
did not at least have a quick guffaw
at the "Chemistry C o m p u t e r
M e l t d o w n " . Felix reported: " O n
Sunday 16 September... all lights...
began to flicker and blow; the air
conditioning system failed; dor-
mant electrical appliances eerily
switched themselves o n and the
culmination came with the explo-
sion of electrical e q u i p m e n t " -
most apocalyptic. Could this be the
end of the world as we know it...?
It was quite an amusing week all
round for those finding pleasure in
cock-ups: apparently new electron-
ic locks fitted in Beit Hall could be
opened using the old credit-card
trick, which will have pleased a lot
of robbers fancying themselves as
Clint Eastwood.

Drugs
A flaming piece of paper stuck to a
door, again in Beit Hall, resulted in
the residents standing out in their
pyjamas for a while. Very fetching,
ln fact, it seems likely that the
words "Look out, Security is c o m -
ing" might well have been written
on the paper. Naughty students
w h o should have k n o w n better
were caught s m o k i n g the o l d
Jamaican W o o d b i n e s in both
Linstead and Beit, presumably get-
ting into the Christmas spirit rather
too early.

Art Critics
1 wouldn't like to be a builder. M o r e
particularly, 1 wouldn't like to have
been one of the builders working
on M e c h Eng renovations this week
in January, w h o d i s c o v e r e d a
decade-old severed human foot
planted as a prank by some medics
years before. M a n y students
wished that the foot had belonged
to Douglas Trainer, N U S President,
as student unions nationwide dis-
played dissent at the N U S ' handling
of the tuition fees issue.
Arguably the most dramatic
happening of the year was chroni-
cled in 1103: the 22-Club, RCS
elective social club, was banned for
two years from all College premises
following a slight faux pas.
M e m b e r s dining in the M a i n Dining
Hall decided to explore the Ante
R o o m Gallery, not realising that an
art exhibition lay ready to be
opened in a few days. Felix report-
e d : "...the revellers... began to
abuse the artworks... with wine,
cigarette burns and v o m i t . A n
offensive note was also found ...
describing the perpetrator's opin-
ion..." The damage was estimated
at about £ 7 0 0 - let's just thank G o d
that there was toilet paper in the
lawy.

Buses Don't Float
Politics bore many people, so ICU
was in for a treat w h e n the papers
went up for yet another round of
sabb elections. The ICU Boat Club's
fortunes improved this week, when
some philanthropic part of society
decided to hand them £ 7 0 3 , 5 0 0
for restoration of its Putney training
site. It is also worth noting that the
Boat Club had rather worse luck the
week after, w h e n their minibus was
found floating in the Thames. Still,
I'm sure they can afford a new one.

Heeps, Andy Heeps
ICU Presidents are like James Bond
actors. Each has his or her o w n
classic style to bring to the job. This
w a s highlighted w h e n A n d r e w
Heeps and Eric Allsop described
the floundering City and Guilds
Union as "a joke" and "a bunch of
arse" respectively. So which of the
two is George Lazenby?

Drugs II
Despite the rather fascist democra-
cy sometimes employed by the
medical schools to rig ICU elec-
tions, four sabbatical posts were
filled first time round: Ed Sexton
(Felix), Dave Wharton (DP F&S),
Dave Hellard (ICU President) and
A d a m Cherrington (DP C&S) were
all blessed by the ballot box.
Waterstone's, having cheekily
swiped the College bookstore deal,
decided it would be quite nice to
start selling cards and stationery as
well - what's next? Fridge freezers?
M e n were behaving badly once
again: the ICU football Fourths
were in trouble for acting in a
"drunken, rowdy manner" at Bath
Union. A representative of Bath
Union was quoted as saying "they
won't be very welcome here". Still,
at least that means they can't actu-
ally lose to Bath again. This was
also the memorable week during
