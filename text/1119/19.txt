A
s w i t n e s s e d by recent events in
Marseilles, the Englishman abroad is, at
best, a loathsome figure. Followed close-
ly by the Antipodeans, Americans a n d of course
the Germans, albeit for entirely different rea-
sons, w e are the Kings of the Effluent Treatment
Centre and little else.
M y problem is that I don't actually enjoy being
English. Yes I know that 1 can say this from the
comfort of m y o w n desk having had a privileged
up-bringing, wanting for nothing, c o c o o n e d in
the wealth and smugness that is for ever Great
Britain (and w h o else w o u l d have the arrogance
to prefix thus). But that IS m y problem y o u see,
for now, w h e n travelling abroad I find myself
overly sensitive to the beliefs and traditions of
the country t o which I have journeyed. It has got
to the point where rather than speak English,
slowly and loudly of course, I will remain mute
until I have sufficient grasp of a language t o at
least order s o m e food, which has led to near
severe bouts of malnutrition. N o t g o o d for o n e
who' s natural demeanour is that of a n stick
insect, and in retrospect probably more ignorant
than if I were t o use m y native tongue, but there
it is, m y problem, mine t o deal with.
So obviously w h e n travelling to a country like
Thailand swathed in the mysteries o f Buddhism
and a language untouched by anything remote-
ly Roman it is not without a little trepidation.
However a r m e d with m y "Rough G u i d e " and m y
"Culture Shock" I can but endeavour to be more
than just another Brit abroad.

B
y the time I land in Chiang Mai, bypassing
Bangkok for fear of being tarred with the
Paedophile brush, I have my list of don'ts
committed to memory which is more than I can
say about anything t o d o with the language,
except strangely enough the number 125.
• Don't touch a Thai on the head.
• Don't point with your feet.
• Always dress conservatively when in public.
• Don't wear black when invited to someone's
house.
• Don't point at all.
• Don't show affection to your partner in public.
• Don't imitate or in any way offend Buddha when
posing for your snapshots.
• Don't eat with your left hand.
• Don't put your fork in your mouth.
And a myriad others but y o u get the drift.
N o w as much as I tried to be a g o o d traveller, the
last two on the list were my constant downfall and
not necessarily for the obvious reason.
Let m e tell you about my childhood...
I a m and have always been the devil's child. I a m
a left-hander. O f this I was constantly reminded
during m y formative years at SouthFields C o f E
County Primary School by the scourge of my life,
one M r s Hughes. This particular little old lady, a
cross between Aunt Flo a n d the child catcher
would delight in whipping the spoon out of m y
hand during pudding, stand over m e (her hot fetid
breath o n m y neck being the only thing stopping
me from dissolving in a pool of chilled sweat), and
make m e spoon custard with my right hand. The
consequence of course being that very little ever
got within a mile of m y mouth. Maybe this
explains 35 years of looking under-nourished.

nyway, the consequence o f this traumat-
ic up-bringing a n d the fact that I a m
European and consequently have always
associated the fork with being the implement of
choice with which t o get sustenance twixt plate
and lip meant that o n more than o n e occasion
in Thailand, left-hand, fork a n d m o u t h were
within close proximity o f one another.
Having read in my travelling bibles that the aver-
age Thai w o u l d sooner walk away than display
signs o f criticism I became sensitive t o knowing
shakes o f the head every time I c o m m i t t e d this
heinous faux-pas in public. A n d it began t o agi-
tate m e t o such a degree that I started t o pick
fault with m y hosts. A n d let's face it if the
Church of England h a d tried a n d failed I'm
d a m n e d (probably) if s o m e eastern mysticism
was going to succeed.
So over the following three weeks if ever I w a s
caught out then I w o u l d bide m y time until able
to chalk o n e u p for the away team. This w o u l d
usually be along the lines o f something environ-
mental i.e watching polystyrene plates and plas-
tic bottles being thrown with gay abandon by the
locals into the streets, rivers, countryside. Petty,
I know, but there was a n unwritten war taking
place here.

nd then, w h e n y o u least expect it, life will
throw something at y o u which puts such
trivialities into perspective. 1 was, howev-
er, unprepared for the object in question being
the size of the Island of Ko Samui.
Having b e c o m e used t o being a minority, I
arrived o n the island t o be confronted by mile
after mile of lardy white flesh with a lurid pink
thong up it's arse, bloated and stranded o n the
sand. This was the culture shock I hadn't been
warned about. Every don't o n m y list was being
flaunted openly. M y first meal came with a knife
and a n over-inflated bill, whilst the couple next
to m e sucked each others tonsils, she narrowly
failing t o stay in her bikini. I longed once again
to be back in Thailand, proper Thailand that is,
where I could put m y fork in m y m o u t h or touch
my partner's foot and feel guilty about it. Where
people w o u l d laugh at m y abysmal attempts at
a foreign language, where I wouldn't feel like I
had arrived in Blackpool in the high season and
it was then that I saw the light, a genius stroke,
a master plan.
Nationalise the whole fucking Island.
Treble the already trebled prices. M a k e the fat,
flabby white puffy ignorant English, Germans,
Australians, South Africans et al pay through the
nose. Confiscate their passports a n d if they
want t o get off the Island then they must earn
the right to. M a k e t h e m learn the list of DON'Ts
forfeiting any entitlement t o leave until they d o .
The money w o u l d c o m e pouring in, t h e baht
w o u l d once more return t o the heady days
before the crash and the money could be used
to supplement the income o f the people in the
Golden Triangle n o w being deprived the right t o
harvest the p o p p y seed, consequently forcing
t h e m into Chiang M a i t o beg o n the streets. Fait
accomplis.
Do that for me, n o s o d that, d o it for y o u and I
promise that in return I'll d o the right handed
s p o o n thing. Even M r s Hughes would smile at
that one.
