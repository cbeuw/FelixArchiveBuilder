THE BIG SUMMER PREVIEW
As well as blockbuster biggies
Godzilla a n d Lost In Space
and a heavy d o s e of
schmaltz from Six Days, Seven
Nights and City of Angels, July also
sees the release o f . . . . Dr. Dolittle,
starring Eddie M u r p h y as the
eponymous animal talking scien-
tist. Think Babe meets Nutty pro-
fessor, and you're probably head-
ing in the right direction. Its a
remake of the 1968 Rex Harrison
musical in the loosest sense of the
w o r d .... O n the subject of musical
adaptations, Les Miserables finally
gets a proper big screen outing.
It's a direct adaptation of the
Victor Hugo novel though, so don't
respect stars Liam Neeson, U m a
Thurman and Geoffrey Rush to
break into song every five minutes
.... The regulation L o w Budget
British Entryâ„¢ c o m e s in the form
of Metroland, an adaptation of the
Julian Barnes novel. Christian Bale
stars as the 60's twentysomething
escaping his married life by fleeing
to France .... Looking to relieve
those halcyon teenage days? Then
catch Love and Death on Long
Island, and remember just how
much y o u hated that s m u g git
Jason Priestly .... For the horror
fans out there, this years major
Hollywood offering c o m e s in the
form of M i m i c . Mira Sorvino is the
y o u n g scientist w h o creates a cure
for a killer disease, but in the
process creates giant killer bugs,
lurking in the N e w York sewers.
The twist is that the bugs can alter
their form to become that of their
pray. Invasion of the
Bociysnatchers style events ensue
.... Chubby Goes D o w n Under is
another outing for Roy Chubby
Brown. Watch it and we kill y o u
...A Thousand Acres is billed as
"King Lear in the Praries". Bizzare
as that may sound, it's attracted a
top notch cast, including Jessica
Lange, M i c h e l l e Pfieffer a n d
Jennifer Jason Leigh .... Re-release
gems this month include Hitchock
classic Psycho, giving y o u the
chance to watch a lovely new print
of the adventures of Norman Bates
and his m u m .... Grease also gets
the re-release treatment. A prime
opportunity to terminally embar-
rass yourself by strutting your
funky stuff. Just watch Travolta go!
G O D Z I L L A
Stars: M a t t h e w Broderick, jean
Reno, Hank Azaria
Director: Roland Emmerich
W h e n : July 17
Roland Emmerich and Dean
Devlin, the producer-direc-
tor combination responsible
for Independence Day, return with
another sure-fire box-office smash,
almost sinking under the weight of
its o w n effects. However, this time
they have chosen to go without any
of the usual A-list actors, opting for
a combination of eighties hero
B r o d e r i c k (Wargames, Ferris
Bueller's Day Off) and Gallic hard-
man Jean Reno (Leon, Mission
Impossible).
There will also be disappoint-
ment for fans of the original
Japanese man-in-a-rubber-suit
spectacular, as Emmerich readily
admits to ditching the entire feel
and plot of the original, in favour of
a more nineties friendly storyline.
He describes the movie as "The
fight between nature and technolo-
gy....it's much more about people
than the original movies". So, noth-
ing like Jurassic park then. O h no.
in essence, the storyline is
hideously simple. Large monster
appears and starts to trample its
way through N e w York, destroying
everything in its path. Only a c o m -
bination of gritty US Military types
and brilliant young scientists can
save the day....Basically, Emmerich
and Devlin re-tread ID4, only with
one big monster replacing lots of
aliens.
Without doubt, this will be the
biggest film of the summer, setting
umpteen new box office records in
the process. But be warned - in the
states it has (unsurprisingly) taken
a critical drubbing, and after just
two weeks has started to slip d o w n
the top ten, overtaken by popular
favourites City of Angels and 77ie
Truman Show.
CITY O F A N G E L S
Stars: M e g Ryan, Nicolas Cage,
Dennis Franz
Director: Brad Silberling
W h e n : July 10
T
his summer's M e g Ryan film
promises all the usual ingredi-
ents - sweet, soppy romance,
characters forced to put love
before life (or, in this case, immor-
tality), and a heavy kleenex quo-
tient.
Nicholas Cage is one of the
heavenly host that occupies Los
Angeles, unseen by the millions of
non-believers w h o live and work in
the city. They congregate o n
M a l i b u beach or perch atop
churches and skyscrapers, watch-
ing over and protecting the citi-
zens. A n d all the time, the p o p u -
lace remain unaware of their pres-
ence, unable to see Cage and his
fellow spirits unless they "will y o u "
to see them.
O n e day Cage encounters
unhappy heart surgeon M e g Ryan,
and, instantly smitten, wills her to
see him. She realises that he is
s o m e h o w different, but (quite sen-
sibly) can't accept his claims to be
a disciple of G o d . Yet how can she
explain her inability to feel his
touch....
Unremarkable schmaltz this
may sound, but with weepie-queen
Ryan and the always likeable Cage
(trying to escape his action-junkie
persona) in the starring roles, City
of Angels should have those of a
more romantic disposition bawling
their eyes out - particularly when
Cage is forced to choose between
immortality and the w o m a n he
loves
For those w h o prefer a little
more substance to their movies, a
minimal level of effects, amusing
cameos from NYPD Blue's Dennis
Franz a n d Homicide's A n d r e
Braugher and a script adapted from
W i m Wenders Wings of Desire,
should combine to produce the hot
favourite for chick-flick of the year.
