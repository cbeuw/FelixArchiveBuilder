he sings like Tori A m o s o n a
bad day. She writes her o w n
songs, a n d she's younger
than m e . If she w a s a bit better,
she'd be fantastic. A s it is, her
angst ridden songs are just irritat-
ing. S o m e of the lyrics are great (/
am your whore/without a
name/you took me in again), but
most of the songs o n this album
are fairly poor. Don't waste your
cash o n it, buy the new Tori A m o s
album instead if y o u really need an
injection of angst ridden female
vocals. Alternatively, y o u c o u l d
c o m e and listen to m e whinging
about m y problems. It'll only cost
you a fiver. EI

T
his Canadian born gathering
is State Side in every w a y .
They have the narration's and
mixing of the Beastie Boys, c o m -
bined with the sampling and many
short tracks style of Beck.
Bran Van 3 0 0 0 is the brainchild
of Jamie Di Salvio, a DJ, re-mixer
and video director. H e gathered
20 Montreal musicians, producers,
singers a n d rappers together a n d
just started recording. Since then
the 'band' has gone o n tour with six
singers a n d as you've probably
guessed the result is an album full
of many flavours.
It isn't until the third song, their
single Drinking In LA that the tracks
have any individuality. The first two
just jump from sample to sample,
and if the Drinking In LA didn't
c o m e along most listeners would
just give u p . Drinking in LA pulls
the listener back in, with its easy
listening rap and strong chorus line.
It clearly stands out o n the albums
being one of the only radio-friendly
songs.
The rest of the album lurches
between rap, reggae, rock, p o p ,
dance a n d indie a n d is difficult to
get into. Bran Van 3 0 0 0 obviously
have the talent to be a g o o d band,
but in an attempt to combine c o n -
trasting sounds, they have cut u p
and over-produced their songs to
much. You get the feeling that they
haven't fully thought out what fits
with what else . If y o u are interest-
ed in sampling or just experiment-
ing with music, however, then C/ee
will give y o u plenty ideas to play
with. David
DEEP PURPLE
Abandon No Stars
C
ool, the rock gods are back'
I thought when I was hand-
ed this C D . Having misspent
many hours of m y youth moshing
away to such gems as My Woman
from Tokyo I w a s really curious
about this new album. Three tracks
and quarter of an hour later, I had
to switch off. This album is arse. Ifs
glam rock at its most pathetic, the
vocals sad/comic, the riffs seeming-
ly r a n d o m . Richie Blackmore's
replacement Steve M o r s e w h o has,
otherwise, done some decent stuff
is insufferably dull a n d Jon Lord's
new H a m m o n d needs many more
miles of touring before it regains its
former glories. Unfortunately this
would also d o him in. There's noth-
ing new or interesting here even for
a die-hard soft rocker caught in a
1985 time warp. El Antoine
SINGLES
Black Box Recorder -England Made Me
Dark lyrics of the Beth Gibbons variety in an alto-
gether Portishead sort of song. Possibly jumping
on the W o r l d Cup/Cool Britannia bandwagon.
Wamdue Project - King Of My Castle
Easy trance beats behind the watery vocal "Must
be a reason why I'm king of my castle" makes
this a pleasing, if slightly bland, single.
Bernard Butler - A Change of Heart
Bernie's n e w song is exactly halfway between
his previous singles Stay and Not Alone. Prone
to adding those cheesy air-guitar bits from Bill &
Ted, I doubt this will a d d to the sizeable credit
he's been building u p this year.
Space - Begin Again
While Space's previous songs have all had a cer-
tain charm lying behind their quirky exterior, this
"Phoney Valentino" attempt is just plain annoy-
ing.
Lodger - Always Round Here
The follow-up to their tremendous debut I'm
Leaving shows co-singer Pearl Lowe being a bit
too Bjork-ish. The song's still great though,
showing signs of a certain band's influence:
Danny Supergrass is Pearl's husband a n d c o -
songwriter.
Velocette - Spoiled Children
Very similar to early St. Etienne but with a hard-
er edge, this lushly harmonised song is quite
endearing. A lay back and chill in the sun song.

Chumbawamba - Top of the World
O h m y G o d I hate C h u m b a w a m b a and this is as
bad as it gets, a world c u p song that has been
linked t o the Spanish team d u e t o the O L E ' s in
it! So this is one y o u should g o no where near.
I wish Chumbawamba were o n t o p of the world,
literally.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
based dance. G A B are crazy live, produce scary
music that sounds a little like Rage Against the
Machine, and are certainly not mainstream. But
that's not necessarily a bad thing at all.
Propellerheads - Bang Onl
A manic electro-laced race through a computer
generated landscape o n coke a n d speed, with
the occasional guitar solo breather. M a d c o m -
pletely m a d . The excellent B-side, Velvet Pants
(Spare Pair Mix) is far more groovy I guess, a
tune that's definitely of the jazzy cigarette vari-
ety!

Beastie Boys - Intergalactic
After four years away the Beasties are finally
back with their amazing new space aged single.
It's typical Beastie's rapping with the much
envogue electro speech being used for the cho-
rus as well as an addictive Rachmaninoff loop in
the background. Simply brilliant!!
Del Amitri - Don't Come Home Too Soon
Another World C u p song but at least this o n e is
for Scotland. Del Amitri sing a moving o d e to
Scottish football misfortune that isn't t o o bad at
all. Certainly not rousing, one for the boys to cry
along to w h e n Scotland c o m e back home in a
few weeks.
Electrasy - Lost in Space
Electrasy are going to be big allegedly. They
appeared o n TFI Friday a weeks ago a n d didn't
particularly impress and neither does this single.
A b o g standard indie/pop s o n g with n o real
imagination or particular style.
Girls Against Boys - Park Avenue
A single that certainly is heavy American guitar
Superior - Being You
A well produced, carefully thought out tune that
is well sung by the female vocalist. Kind of an
intelligent, melancholic indie track that is remi-
niscent of the Levellers but definitely not as
cheesy. The B-sides are g o o d t o o with a mini-
malistic 80's feel t o them. M a y be a band t o
watch out for.
Ramzi.
