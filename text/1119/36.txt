GREASE
Starring: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John,, Stockard Channing
Director: Randal Kleiser
I
thought I'd seen Crease. I've
certainly seen Crease 2 a n d
Saturday Night Fever, 1 recall
most of the songs and the image of
Olivia N e w t o n John in tight leather
trousers has been with m e since
pre-puberty. But the minute the
cheesy cartoon intro began, I sud-
denly realised. I have never actual-
ly seen Crease - the greatest disco
flick ever made.
The truth is, that's not such a
bad thing. All I ever needed to
know about Crease I knew well
before I c a m e t o t h e c i n e m a .
There's n o H i t c h c o c k - l i k e sus-
pense, no intricate sub-plots like a
Ridley Scott film and no trademark
Tarantino violence, it's just a musi-
cal like any other: a series of set
pieces, very loosely tied to a
cheesy story that you've seen far
too many times alteady, thank y o u
very m u c h .
If y o u really want care, then it
goes something like this: Travolta is
the 'coolest' of the T Birds, a high-
school gang w h o hang out with the
Pink Ladies. H e met Newton-John

during the summer holiday a n d
now she's m o v e d to his school.
However, she doesn't fit in with the
John Travolta - style on a stick
'cool' scene. Meanwhile, rival gang
the Scorpions want to race the T
Birds, and there's a National Dance
TV show c o m i n g to Rydall High. But
to be honest, none of that really
matters, if y o u want an intricate,
clever story, rent out The Usual
Suspects. Grease is not about the
story, it's about 'avin' a larf.
You may have heard about the
cult following of Showgirls. People
just watch to take the piss out of it.
Crease is all that a n d so much
more - it has a universal "So
cheesy, it's great" appeal. W h e n it
c a m e t o classics like "Greased
Lightning", everyone did the clappy
bit. You know, THAT bit. A n d w h o
could forget the hot-dog cartoon in
the background during "Stranded at
the Drive-in"?
It"s not quite as groovy as it
probably w a s twenty years ago
(before s o m e of us were even
born) a n d at times you'll probably
feel really sheepish while watching
it. If y o u know the songs and take a
few like-minded mates, then just
go along and have a laugh. After all,
you've only got your credibility to
lose. 1*1

RED CORNER
Starring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling
Director: jon Avnet
I
magine waking up in Bejing next
to the corpse of an exotic beau-
ty with w h o m y o u spent an
entirely pleasant evening just a few
hours earlier. Then you are not so
gently removed by a significant
portion of the local police force to
a place of detention where, having
only a whiskey clouded recollection
of the previous night's events and a
few words of Chinese, y o u can d o
nothing except pray for the mercy
of a judicial system not known for
it's leniency. By n o w you're proba-
bly pretty confused a n d altogether
terrified, while the news that those
guilty of a capital offence are gen-
erally shot within a week of sen-
tencing is unlikely to help lift your
spirits.
Jack M o o r e , though, is made of
sterner stuff. Played by Richard
Gere, he is in Bejing to close a
hugely lucrative satellite television
deal, the first to be sanctioned by
the Chinese government. The fact
that this makes him a prime target
for a set-up is not lost o n Gere, so
when he is arrested he rather rapid-
ly resolves to clear his name.
Against the wishes of his court-
Richard Gere's award winning "confused" look.
appointed defence lawyer Bai Ling
who knows that a confession will
bring a lighter sentence, jack insists
on an innocent plea, even threaten-
ing to defend himself if she will not
capitulate. The scene is set for an
extremely conventional courtroom
based tale of conspiracy, albeit one
in which the cultural differences of
the leading characters could add a
little interest. Unfortunately, they
don't.
The issue of the contrasting
background of the lawyer a n d the
accused is crowbarred into their
conversations in the form of largely
irrelevant exchanges o n the subject
of the murder rate in America and
the like. What is more, the conspir-
acy which is sometimes enough to
hold one's attention in a film of this
sort is pathetically poorly hidden.
W h e n w e find out w h o is responsi-
ble for Gere's misfortune, it comes
as no surprise at all. Presumably,
the novel setting is supposed to
excuse this, but it really doesn't
c o m e close.
Gere's cocky reaction t o his
predicament is irksome in itself, but
the impression that it is born of the
righteous indignation which any
American would feel makes it even
harder to swallow. Rather than
serve as an aspect of his nightmar-
ish situation, disturbing footage of
an execution seems to be included
mainly to highlight the swift severi-
ty of the Chinese legal system.
After all, it's far more humane to
keep prisoners o n death r o w for
years while their lives hang in the
balance, isn't it?
All this turns what could have
been an affecting personal story
with some political significance into
a deeply awful film with a bit of
crass s o a p boxing thrown i n .
Richard Gere has been outspoken
in the past o n the human rights
record of the Chinese government,
particularly their behaviour in Tibet,
and here he finds himself in a posi-
tion to make a difference. Sadly,
however, Red Corner does no o n e
any favours. [|
