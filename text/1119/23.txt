" Before I start
sips**"- this article it seems pru-
dent to get a couple of things clear.
Firstly I a m not a fan of cars. You could even
say that I don't like them much. Secondly this article
will contain s o m e car worship. Sorry.
Let m e clarify the first point. 1 don't lite cars because there are*
too many of them. I don't see them as a g o o d way < . s p o i l -
ing people. They are noisy, smelly, uncomfortable a

* P^lHt, Silly cars which I shall praise.
These are cars which are plain silly, either massively c
% ered, stupidly styled or offer a wealth of . • u-i t --s.iry extras
Take a M e r c e d e s S Class. It does . eed a six litre engine,
it's stupidly large and it h.is I'oubie-glaztng, Every time 1
see one I smile.

Ferraris and Porsches. These really are unjusti-
fiably powerful, a n d expensive. There Is n o
way you need one in South Kensington. A n d
that is exactly why they are so g o o d . They
are one of the few remaining things chat
can be acceptably s h o w n off in public.

their engineers dream of.
This, as far as they are concerned, is IT, the dogs bollocks.
And lets face it the Porsche 1998 91 1 GT1 is cool, i t s f a s t it cor-

The reason is simple; watching the racing is fun, but only for about
twenty minutes. Firstly y o u don't actually see much, after all the cars
average about 120 m p h . Secondly the noise is incredible. W h e n

p u t what is it like for spectators? The answer in short is tacky, very
tacky. O n the track no expense has been spared, off it no expense
has been spent. The car parks are fields, the paths are dirt, the loos
are unbearable and the catering make them essential. I must admit
that we did
not " d o " Le M a n s properly as such.
To d o that w e w o u l d have had to get up at five, drive through France
like the clappers, see the start and
not leave the track-side until

You also want to c o m e with a large group so that y o u can stake out
an area of grass in the car parks for yourselves and guard it fiercely.
Parking is ample but the number of cars which the spectators c o m e
in is simply incredible, we're talking as far as the eye can see. Hence
any g o o d spaces near the track are in real d e m a n d and s o m e silly
parking goes on.
You also need to be prepared to feel like shit o n the second
day as there are almost no facilities for washing, and as
m e n t i o n e d the loos are to be
avoided. The ideal thing is
get into the executive areas;
being invited by a car company is also a g o o d idea. Here
y o u get the full VIP treatment.
You also need to be keen. If you're not interested don't go. There
is nothing at the track for non-racing fans so life w o u l d get very
dull, if y o u know what you're talking about it is quite easy to
get a conversation going o n the merits of carbon brakes etc.
with another spectator, as the c r o w d is very friendly, and
mostly British.
In short Le M a n s is very cool, but can't really hold it's
own for two days. It is definitely something that
should be done once, but is unlikely to b e c o m e a
permanent fixture on your calendar. If y o u g o enjoy
it, but don't hesitate to d o something else if y o u .
get bored. After all it is only a couple of hours to
