ALAIN PLATEL'S LES BALLETS C DE LA B: LETS OP BACH
Queen Elizabeth Hall
A
few weeks ago 1 wrote
about the exciting dance
season in London and gave
a little advice on the best compa-
nies to go and see. One of these
was Alain Platel's Les Ballets C de la
B, from Ghent in Belgium.
He was over here in May last
year with his work La Tristeza
Complice: one of the most incredi-
ble things 1 have ever seen. It had
an amazing success all over
Europe. Dance fans have been
eagerly expecting his latest offer-
ing. Well, this is no disappoint-
ment, in fact it goes a step further
than La Tristeza Complice.
It's called Lets op Bach. It's in
the same vein with a mix of all sorts
of arts: Bach's music played by a
group of eight musicians, three
opera singers, the dancers of
course and the odd circus number
too.
The scene takes place in some
kind of garden with chairs, a pad-
dling pool, sun beds on the roof of
the house...a very down to earth,
simple surrounding. The small
orchestra mark the beginning by
playing a very emotional piece cre-
ating a very palpable sense of
beauty and serenity. As they finish,
the chaos starts: the dancers
appear, all in different shapes,
colours and ages along with two
cute little girls. From then on and
until the end, Alain Platel stages
life: the interactions between
human beings, life in a group,
friendships, and relationships.
There is such a strong sense of pas-
sion in this guy's work. The emo-
tion is so present in the way the
dancers move: they are complete
actors. I have rarely seen such fas-
cinating performers. They seem to
be suffering in their own souls. The
scenes, at times, are hilarious, for
example when they all start danc-
ing on "One of us" sung by Prince,
led by a very tall black man in drag.
Although comic is never far away, it
always depicts the saddest things,
the desperation these people are
feeling, the lack of communication,
the loneliness. Platel shows life as it
is: an endless isolated struggle. At
one point, the four women end up
screaming political slogans at the
audience, with a very funny refer-
ence to Kofi Annan, before letting a
little girl say: "yo quiero a todo el
mundo". (I love everyone)
The dancers are absolutely per-
fect, the ideas in the choreography
so inventive. The singing and music
work very well with this. Platel has
created a piece with extraordinary
impact, both visually and emotion-
ally making us laugh and cry, watch
in disgust and admiration. He is a
true artist, one of that rare kind, like
Maurice Bejart, who can make
dance exciting and innovative,
within our context, yet giving his
ideas such space to breathe and to
mature. If you weren't there last
week, then do look out for Platel's
next visit to London. This is not
pretentious and inaccessible art.
Anyone with a taste for something
a little different will love it.

THE CANON PHOTOGRAPHY GALLERY
The Victoria & Albert Museum
I
n all their leaflets, the V&A have
been saying they own "one of
the finest collections if the art
photography in the world". So
off 1 went to check this big state-
ment out. My expectations were
very high and I had imagined I was
going to see the most breathtaking
display of photos I had ever seen.
Well I must admit that I was a
little disappointed by the whole
thing, although there is some great
art on show. The gallery follows the
first steps of photography as early
as 1839 up to the latest cutting
edge ideas by artists such as Adam
Fuss. The "New Art"" room expos-
es the two major photographic
inventions: the French Daguerreo-
type, an image on polished metal
and the English counterpart, which
was to become photography as we
know it (with the idea of a "nega-
tive"). The first steps seem to be
quite focused on landscapes and
buildings and then quite a few pic-
tures of the colonies, mainly India.
The interests of the Victorian era....
As we progress in time, the
subject gets more interesting and
famous names like Carrier-Besson,
Man Ray and Bill Brandt begin to
appear developing very personal
themes with apparition of the
model as object of beauty and way
of experimenting (a beautiful por-
trait of Lee Miller). The pre-war
days also bring a more political
aspect to photography, with pic-
tures of Africa This has continued
to be one of the many faces of this
art: there is a very emotional photo
of a black girl and a white boy
together in South Africa taken in
1964 by David Goldblatt.
The 70's go even further into
the experimental vein with an
amazing portrait of Francis Bacon
by John Deakin. It is also time for
further explorations into fashion
with people like David Bailey. In the
last rooms of the exhibition, the
V&A seems to have concentrated
more on the odd and wonderful
things made in the past decade.
They have recreated for us Helen
Chadwick's "The Oval Court". It is
extremely interesting to look at,
very different but quite powerful.
Using a Canon photocopier, she
has made a cycle out of several
self-portraits in different positions,
including little animals and fruit. It
feels likes her interpretation of
what it is to be a woman. Finally,
we are offered some of the most
recent ideas in photography,
including a return to the sources by
Adam Fuss. He uses primary tech-
niques with a 20th century twist to
it. David Hockney demonstrates
the possibilities of mixing photog-
raphy and painting and there are a
few other original things there.
I seem to have now convinced
myself, after all, that this gallery is
very good. 1 thought there would
be much more. There will be noth-
ing new for most people but it's still
nice to have 140 years of photog-
raphy in such a small place. This is
a great addition to the art scene in
London and we can only hope
there will be plenty more later.

WORLD
Science Museum
aterials may sound like
J% #
1 the most boring course
I ^ / 1 on Earth and one can
only take so much talk about con-
crete from Civil Engineers but the
latest exhibition in the Science
Museum is of genuine relevance to
every degree discipline. On show
are some stunning examples of
haute couture using the latest arti-
ficial materials, including a dress
made from a plastic with the prop-
erties of paper, part of a collection
commissioned for Bjork. Motor-
bike fiends will be surprised to see
the racing leathers that protected
Carl Fogarty from a 1 OOmph crash
during the World Super Bike trials,
though you do need to look close-
ly to spot the scuffing. Perhaps the
most visually striking exhibit, which
will make it into the next edition of
the Guinness Book of Records, is a
giant molecular model of diamond.
It is intriguing that as you change
viewing angle, moire patterns play
over the surface, more a work of
art than science. Finally, I truly
hope that the touchy-feely exhibit,
giving comparisons between natur-
al and man made materials, does-
n't get the animal rights lobby too
excited. It only looks like three
otters worth C
