TO PAY OR NOT
TO PAY? ;
The start of next term sees the
introduction of tuition fees, with
an estimated one third of stu-
dents paying £ 1,000 per year for
their education. Current surveys
suggest that most would-be stu-
dents are in the dark concerning
how the fees will affect them, and
how much they will have to pay.
Despite government assurances
that the fees will be means-test-
ed, their own figures indicate that
student numbers could drop in
the next few years as parents are
reluctant to pay the fees. The
NUS has estimated that universi-
ties could be left with £31 million
per year of unpaid fees, which
begs the question what will uni-
versities do with students who
refuse to pay?
Oxford University made clear
its position on this subject last
week. In plans that are bound to
upset students, the University has
declared that it will expel anyone
who fails to pay before the end of
the first term. Such students will
be denied all access to the
University until they have paid off
their debt. Other universities can
be expected to take a similar
stance, although Imperial's posi-
tion on the matter was unknown
at the time Felix went to press.
M I N
WAGE
M U M
Britain is to have a minimum
wage, starting in April 1999. Last
week the government accepted
recommendations from the Low
Pay Commission to set the mini-
mum wage at £3.60 per hour.
The rate for 18 to 21 year olds will
be lower, however, starting at
£3.00 and rising to £3.20 in June
2000. Under 18s will not be cov-
ered by the minimum wage.
The announcement of a mini-
mum wage brings Britain in line
with other European countries,
most of whom have higher mini-
mum rates of pay. There are also
no plans to link Britain's minimum
wage to inflation, so its actual
value is likely to decline over time.
Margaret Beckett, President of
the Board of Trade, has denied
that the minimum wage is a
watered-down version of the gov-
ernment's manifesto pledge: In
the House of Commons she
claimed that it would help two
million workers escape from
"poverty pay".
The Conservative Opposition
has criticised the concept of a
minimum wage: Speaking in the
Commons, John Redwood,
Shadow President of the Board of
Trade, claimed that "a minimum
wage policy will not work".
Before the announcement was
made many small businesses
were worried that a minimum
wage would damage their
prospects, but the £3.60 level is
much lower than many expected.
Workers' unions had pressed for
over one pound more an hour,
and many feel betrayed by New
Labour. Business groups, howev-
er, have accepted the pay level as
reasonable.
M O D LIKES A BIT
A defence establishment in
Worcestershire has become the
latest company to discover its
employees are using computers
at work to download pornography
from the internet. More than
170,000 images were allegedly
found during routine security
checks on computer systems at
the Defence Evaluation and
Research Agency. The agency is
responsible for developing battle-
field technology for the Ministry
of Defence: One computer, sup-
posed to be used to communi-
cate with defence experts around
the world, was found to have
spent 70% of its last three weeks'
online time downloading images.
The issue is almost certainly
going to be raised in parliament
this week, with internet pornogra-
phy already being a topical politi-
cal talking point. With the inter-
net now a regular feature of most
offices, and the number of porno-
graphic or otherwise dubious
websites rising, it is felt that legal
safeguards must be put in place.
The problem of how to regulate
an international network com-
prised of millions of computers
has yet to be satisfactorily
answered.
IC Win UL Cricket
Cup - Or Do They?
JEREMY THOMSON
IC's cricket first team returned vic-
torious from Motspur Park last
Tuesday, after beating Royal
Holloway by four wickets to take
the University of London League
Cup.
However, they are now facing
disqualification
after a com-
plaint from the
R o y a l
Holloway team
that they had
fielded ringers
in the final.
The controver-
sy is centred
on 1C batsman
Imran Khan,
who opened
play but was bowled out for just
one run. Mr Khan is a medical stu-
dent and, according to Royal
Holloway, is not eligible to play in
the Imperial College team, despite
the fact St Mary's did not field a
team this year.
The University of London Union
does not yet recognise ICSM as
part of Imperial College, although
from next year medical students
will be able to play for IC teams
where there is no alternative. As
the situation is not clear, a ULU
committee will meet to examine
the rules of the league.
Charlie Joynt, DP(C&5), said
that the situation is "ridiculous".
"He [lmran Khan] has been playing
for three or four years, and they've
never com-
plained before."
Andy Heeps,
ICU President,
went further;
"It's typical of
bloody ULU", he
said, "as far as
I'm concerned,
we're keeping
the cup."
In a recent
development, it
has now been revealed that Mr
Khan's performance in a previous
match may have been more influ-
ential. Apparently, a score of forty
while playing for the IC second
team could have prevented an all-
Holloway final.

£2.5m Motspur Sale
DAVID ROBERTS
The final meeting of the year for
University of London Union Council
saw the sale of Motspur Park, the
ULU sportsground and one of the
Union's biggest assets.
The sale has been in negotia-
tions all year, ever since the first
offers for the ground were received
by the Union. Both Fulham FC and
Chelsea FC, who wish to use the
ground as a training facility, sub-
mitted bids well above the valua-
tion made by the University.
However, the offer from Fulham
(owned by Harrods boss
Mohammed al Fayed) has been
viewed as more favourable by the
Union's negotiators - importantly,
Fulham pledge to ensure no reduc-
tion in student usage of the site.
Consequently, whilst the Union
stands to profit to the tune of £2-
2.5 million from the sale, and save
up to £95,000 on annual mainte-
nance charges, a rental charge of
just £5000 a year should see no
change in student activity at the
site.
The meeting questioned the
proposal at length, expressing con-
cern at the long tern implications of
the sale. However, a guarantee of a
percentage of any profits generat-
ed by a further sale of the ground
within the next twenty years
appeased those present. The
President of ULU, Siva
Ganeshanedan, also promised that
all proceeds from the sale will be
set aside to fund a new sports facil-
ity, which will probably be a new
sports hall in the Bloomsbury area.
A vote on the proposal gave the
go-ahead to Mr Ganeshanedan to
finalise details of the sale.
Contracts should be completed
and signed by the end of the sum-
mer, so that the deal can be com-
pleted in time for the new academ-
ic year.
