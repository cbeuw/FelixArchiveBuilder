CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS IN BRIEF
SONARTRIBE. SIGNALS
22 Jury • • • •
Welcome to
Sonartribe's debut album. This is,
without a shadow of a doubt, one
of the most innovative D n' B pro-
jects of recent time. From the off,
Signals provides an awesome
fusion of techno-style melodies
with rough bass-lines.
Straying from the D 'n' B norm,
Sonartribe are Fulham based Mike
Marsh and Lorna Lewis. When they
are not programming for the BBC or
teaching Aerobics, their shared love
of the weird and wonderful leads
them to produce some of the dark-
est Drum and Bass around.
Mike and Lorna's ability to wan-
der through a journey comprising of
hardsteppin' breaks and beats,
slammin' sub-hooks, Balearic guitar
riffs and techno-edged electro
beats leaves you wondering what
else they are going to unleash.
All ten tunes are top notch, and
those such as Night Acoustic,
Everyone else and Rays ate an
essential for any DJ box, although
the only slight criticism is the lack
of variety from tune to tune.
DEEP DISH JUNK SCIENCE
Out Now it-kit
Deep Dish, contrary to popular
belief, is not a cooking utensil
needed to follow along with Ready
Steady Cook but the hottest thing
ever to come out of Washington.
Ali and Sharam have rocked the
house scene since collaborating in
1992. Their first major work was a
lead remix of Hideaway by De'Lacy.
Since then, they have been asked
to spin their magic in re-working
tracks by artists such as Janet
Jackson, Tina Turner, Paula Abdul
and Everything but the Girl (EBTG).
Deep Dish are musicians. This
debut album features live guitars,
sax and keyboards. Track 2, Future
Of The Future, with vocals by
EBTG's Tracey Thorn, is a reworking
of their first track with the
Deconstruction label, Stay Gold.
Ali and Sharam's diverse music
taste is no better illustrated than
between Summer's Over, which
has a laid back, trancey feel to it,
and Mohammed is Jesus, which is
arguably what house used to be in
the good old days.
This album is a masterpiece. All
tunes live up to the duo's high stan-
dards, and eventually it is said that
this album will be taken fully live.
Until then, roll a reefer, turn up your
system and chill out.
P.S. To D Clarke (Physics 1)
who in Issue 1115 voiced his dis-
gust at the lack of grammar in these
reviews. If you feel as though you
have something to offer, then
please come and show us your
stuff - but in the meantime, is my
colon in the right place ?- you seem
like the sort of person who would
know....

Dope Dragon. Wayz Of The Dragon
22 June • • • •
Dope Dragon, coming out of
the Full Cycle camp (you should
know their names by now!) bring
us a collection of out and out Drum
and Bass tracks with enthuses on
the dance floor. The first couple of
tracks Came and Conjured and
Who Are You set the stall out for
how the rest of the album is to fol-
low. It's a bit hard to judge just how
good these tracks are as I've only
heard it on tape, but what I could
tell is that it is packed full of quality
and originality from the Bristol
crew. Plenty of rolling and hard-
stepping business going on here
and, if you've been out recently,
you're bound to have heard at least
one of these tracks. As with all the
recent Drum and Bass albums, it
has the standard Warhead sound-
ing track. Overall very impressive,
so much so that I'm going to have
to track down the vinyl before it's
too late.
Made Great In Britain Mixed by the
DreemTeem (4 Liberty)
Out Now • • • •
A much-hyped album from
those leaders of garage music, the
Dreem Teem, show-casing the
cream of the UK garage scene
that's blown up over the past year.
So, what's this latest mixed compi-
lation like? Well at first I was a little
disappointed as I know what good
DJs these boys are and I under-
stand that the enthusiasm is on the
tunes with the mixing taking second
place. The album rolls along seam-
lessly with great tune selection and
impressive mixing skills still on
show, if kept to a minimum. Not
quite as hard as their club sets but
instead focusing on the more vocal
side of underground garage. That
said, however, there are plenty of
true underground anthems on here
like : Dubz 4 Kubz - / Neeed Your
Love, Dreem Teem's superb mix of
Shola Ama's - Much Love, Ramsey
and Fenns - Style, TJ Cases - My
Inspiration, I could go on but I
won't. Plenty of underground
action with a nice mix of more
vocal numbers, it should go down
with train-spotters' and the occa-
sional clubber equally well.
Black Whole Styles. Big Dadda
Compilations 8th June it it it it
This is a compilation of previ-
ously released, exclusive and
remixed tracks from the Big Dadda
label. Drawing on MCs and produc-
ers ranging from New York too
York. Black Whole Styles features
some of the realist hip-hop I've
heard in some time. If you've
grown disillusioned by the mass of
more commercial hip-hop flooding
the scene at the moment, this
could be just the answer, taking you
back to the roots when hip-hop
was original, upfront and experi-
mental: this captures all that and
more. Phat beats, dark atmospher-
icals, dope lyrics and plenty of
scratch action keeps it lively but
then again, there are so many dif-
ferent styles here (nearly every
track is different) I couldn't possibly
sum them up in so little space. Take
a chance on this relatively unknown
label as I'm sure it will surprise you.
Freestyle Files 4. Crackers Delight
(K7) 6 Jury • • •
This starts off with a distinctive
summer feel to it, in a down beat
style you could call it happy hip-
hop. Laid back grooves over easy
going beats, and a summery feel. I
found a few of the tracks a little to
light and fluffy, for v/ant of a better
expression, for my taste. But with
tracks from such labels as R&S,
Ninja Tunes and Nuphonic and
even a Drum and Bass track from
the Dub Club again with a summer
vibe, you don't know what to
expect next. Then you get to the
second CD which 1 expected to
continue in the same up lifting sort
of styles, but instead you get a dark
minimal down beat number to get
the CD started - in total contrast to
the first. You have to be very open
minded to appreciate this assorted
collection of beats.
Rough Technique Mixed by the
Freestylers (Freskanova)
29 June ••••1/2
You should know what to
expect from the Freestylers by now,
block rocking break beat/nu skool
action, showing us that they don't
just make shit-hot tunes but also
can more than hold their own
behind the turntables. If you've
been lucky enough to catch their DJ
outings all over London and
beyond, then this CD will not disap-
point. Made up entirely from the
Freskanova back catalogue, unbe-
lievable how many rough tunes
they've put out, featuring many
firm party favourites and new unre-
leased material. With the undisput-
ed scratch DJ talents of J Rock
putting the finishing touches to a
faultless 70 odd minutes of nu-
skool mayhem.
Muki. Cabin Fever (Mantra)
6 Jury • • • •
As with most albums these
days, this one defies any distinct
style of music other than electron-
ic. Based mainly in the area of trip-
hop but often spilling over into
Drum and Bass, Techno and even
Deep House.
Track two - Jahbar, starts out in
a style reminiscent of Orbital's sort
of sound and gradually builds (over
nine and a half minutes) to a
trancey deep house sort of thing.
Plenty of live instruments are also
incorporated to create this unique
sound that is Muki: flutes, sax, keys
and in track three what sounds like
a kazoo! But it is all done so well,
they seem to get it just right every
time, getting quite musical in
places. Which helps create the
blissed out atmospheric grooves
that fill this album - described in the
press release as lush laid back elec-
tronica and I can't think of a better
way of putting it so I won't.
So Luke Mullen and Jules Evans
who make up Muki have made an
interesting and entertaining album
and, as they have only been making
music for just over a year, it just
shows either how talented they are
or how easy it is to make electron-
ic music! jo Public
