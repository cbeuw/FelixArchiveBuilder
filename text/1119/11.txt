COLUMNS 24 June 1998
r Blair is a pret-
ty straight sort
of guy. At least,
this is certainly what the
Labour publicity machine would
have us believe. In Northern Ireland
Tony Blair made a simple hand-
written pledge concerning the con-
nection between the release of
paramilitary prisoners which was
considered to have had an enor-
mous effect on Unionist opinion of
the Good Friday Agreement. When
the press lambasted him over the
million-pound donation to Labour
by Bernie Ecclestone, followed by
the exemption of Formula One rac-
ing from the ban on tobacco adver-
tising, Tony addressed the nation in
a fireside chat about how honest he
was and how, like ordinary people,
he made mistakes too. He didn't
miss the opportunity to upbraid the
press for daring to accuse him of
basic corruption.
Naturally then the public will
relax while Blair and Ashdown
announce that they would be work-
ing together "to put power closer
to the people". They also intend to
renew the constitution and
strengthen our individual rights.
Some of this seems to be genuine.
The creation of the Scottish
Parliament, Welsh Assembly and
Greater London Assembly should
bring decision-making down to a
more local level. No-one doubts
that the Conservative Government
drew power to the national govern-
ment from local authorities on an
unprecedented scale and that its
Labour successors are looking at
ways to reverse this process.
However, the constitutional
plans Labour have are far more
ominous. Britain is one of the few
nations in the world not to have a
written constitution, which is made
up instead of a patchwork of parlia-
mentary legislation and convention
and common law. This puts it in a
fragile state, although most politi-
cians respect its status above party
political advantage. It seems there
are three fronts on which the
Government intends to secure
increase power for itself. The enor-
mous majority Labour has in the
Commons, and the ever-stratos-
pheric public support it currently
enjoys gives it a great opportunity
to push through changes thought
untenable by previous administra-
tions. Lord Richard, the Labour
Leader of the Lords, confirmed the
Government's intention to remove
the right of hereditary peers to
speak and vote in the Lords. This
has been known previously and has
, popular support. As detailed in
their manifesto, the Government
do not intend to replace the Upper
Chamber with anything until they
have had a full consultation as to
what to replace it with - which
leaves an indefinite period of time
where the Chamber of Parliament
designed to scrutinise the work of
the Commons will be filled with
Tony's friends and other Labour
placemen. It would become 'Blair's
poodle' in the same way the Lords
was 'Balfour's poodle' in the early
1900s. This would be less likely to
happen if Lords reform happened
in one go, and it seems discussion
is all but exhausted as to the possi-
bilities available in a reform. This
ilar-minded individuals) which will
without an iota of doubt return sug-
gesting we use proportional repre-
sentation in Parliament. The
Government has already allowed it
to seep into political life through
the Scottish Parliament (partly
elected by PR) and the new elec-
toral procedure for Britain's mem-
bers of the European Parliament.
We will undoubtedly be offered the
opportunity to vote for PR in a ref-
erendum, which will naturally bring
power to the people etc. and with
the evidence that it worked in
Scotland and Europe, combined

Eye
regrettably suggests that the only
reason for this 'two-part' reforma-
tion is to give the Prime Minister
effective total control over the
membership of the Upper House,
meaning that so much as a squeak
from its appointed members, and
Her Majesty will find herself
delighted to summon twenty new
Labour hacks to the House.
The next ominous sign is the
way the Government seem to have
been handling referendums. The
manoeuvring over the arrangement
of questions for the Scottish
Parliament referendum and the
prepared timing of the Welsh refer-
endum to be a week after the
Scottish one (tacticians calculated
that the uprising of feeling after the
certain "Yes" vote of the Scottish
referendum would persuade the
Welsh), combined with some bla-
tant ministerial propaganda sug-
gests that the Government would-
n't be amiss to vague wordings and
careful timing to bias the result of
referenda. With the Lords as an
energetic poodle, legislation for
such referenda shouldn't be diffi-
cult (it's already happened). The
Government has already been lob-
bying the Neill inquiry, urging legal
limits on referenda campaign
spending to muffle publicity for the
'wrong' side of a referendum,
allowing ministers to create propa-
ganda as required.
To go back to the beginning
again, the co-operation between
Labour and Liberal Democrats on
'constitutional issues' is far more
worrying in the present context
where Labour genuinely could push
through dangerous measures. Lord
Jenkins has been running a review
committee (entirely staffed by sim-
with the steamroller method used
to push it through, we may well
vote for it in the end.
The main purpose of PR is to
keep Labour and the Lib Dems in
power. That is all there is to it. Each
party talks of the advantages of
each system, but essentially the
Conservative and Labour parties
opposed it because our first-past-
the-past system kept them in
power and the Liberal Democrats
wanted PR, which would give them
power. Labour's initial opposition
has been softened as they have
found a way to kee the Tories out
hopefully for good.
People may disagree with this
column, suggesting that PR would
actually work, and that it is dis-
graceful that the Greens/Lib
Dems/whoever else's parliamentary
representation is woefully short of
its electoral mandate, leaving the
two dominant parties in absolute
power. However to see the real
problems of PR, one has to step
back from the plights of individuals
and parties. The first past the post
system gives the UK and elective
dictatorship, where one party
(more accurately, one Prime
Minister) has vast power for five
years. Then the people vote and
the government remains in power
or is replaced.
With PR the situation will be dif-
ferent. This time, no party will in
reality ever have overall control,
and will have to form a coalition.
This may improve things on the
lines that the smaller parties will be
able to form coalitions and have
some say in the affairs of govern-
ment. While this may sound fine, it
causes a host of dangerous prob-
lems. It firstly gives the Head of
State (in our case the Sovereign
who is supposed to stay out of pol-
itics) the fearsome responsibility of
inviting a person to form a coali-
tion, seeing if it can be done, and if
not inviting someone else and so
on. As far as a person's vote count-
ing for what finally gets into power,
the second largest party usually
wouldn't be invited to join, so their
votes wouldn't matter as much as
the votes for the smaller parties.
Assume Labour had got most
votes in a General Election here.
Then Her Majesty would ask the
Labour leader to form a coalition,
giving him say, a week to do so
(otherwise his Downing Street days
are over). He would ask say, the Lib
Dems and the Ulster Unionists to
do so, otherwise he won't have
enough votes and another General
Election could be called. Therefore
the Lib Dems and the Ulster
Unionists could exact whatever
they wanted out of them, as hap-
pens all the time in countries with
PR.
All the people who voted for
the opposition party don't get a
look in. The small parties receive a
voice totally out of proportion with
their electoral mandate, the
Government governs the country to
appease some minute party rather
than the electorate, and the whole
Government can be knocked down
by a small party pulling out of a
coalition. Italy's unstable PR system
has caused endless embarrassment
to it on the world stage, leaving it
without coherent policies and
decreasing respect by its people for
its government. New Zealand is
beginning to regret its decision to
incorporate PR into its Parliament.
But there is something even
more sinister about PR, which
explains its support by some of the
Blairite Labour apparatchiks. As the
number of seats gained in the
Parliament is proportional to the
number of votes cast, the principle
of constituencies and MPs for a
particular area disappears. Instead
the party would draw up ordered
lists of members. Therefore the
party would have total and
absolute control over its parliamen-
tary membership. Any discordant
voices would be silenced by threat
of disappearing off the lists for the
'ballot-box' in the next election.
Internal party democracy, already
badly damaged by Labour in the
past three years, would breathe its
last. Rather than putting power in
the hands of the people and indi-
vidual members, PR places it in the
hands of party leaders, a motley
collection of small parties and no-
one else. A less democratic system
would be hard to fathom.
