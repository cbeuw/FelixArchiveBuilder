24 June 1998 FILM 47
THE BIG SUMMER PREVIEW
ARMAGEDDON
Stars: Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi,
Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck
Director: Michael Bay
When: October
A
s far as pointless action and
violence is concerned, this is
the big one. Jerry
Bruckheimer, producer of The
Rock, Con Air, Top Gun, Crimson
Tide and a hundred-and-one other
adrenaline ride movies, teams up
with The Rock director Bay to bring
you the undoubted winner of
"Stupidest movie of the year,
1998".
In a chain of events suspicious-
ly similar to Mimi Leder's Deep
Impact, scientists spot a meteor
heading toward earth, threatening
to obliterate mankind. Queue deep
miners Bruce Willis and Steve
Buscemi climbing aboard a space
shuttle strapped to a nuclear mis-
sile, to show a lump of rock the
size of Texas that America's the
boss.
Of course, with no previous
training as astronauts, these guys
are going to have to be pretty hero-
ic - but with an all star cast led by
Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Liv
Tyler (somewhat bizzarely cast as
Willis' wife), current hot talent Ben
Affleck and a host of other familiar
faces, how could they possibly fail?
This being a Bruckheimer pic-
ture, however, what really matters
is the effects, and with a $ 100 mil-
lion budget combined with a plot
which allows for mass devastation
and an H-bomb strapped to billion
dollars of space hardware, how can
Armageddon be anything less than
jaw dropping?
Obviously, if you're one of
those weirdos who doesn't think
ninety minutes of death, destruc-
tion and mindless violence is worth
the price of admission, then you
should avoid Armageddon like the
plague. But then you'd be missing
out on the real point of summer
releases - escapist entertainment,
explosions and a complete
absence of plot. After all, what's
the point of summer if you're not
going to relax and enjoy yourself?
SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS
Stars: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche,
David Schwimmer
Director: Ivan Reitman
When: July 3
T
his year, Harrison Ford - the
world's most reliable and
bankable star - lends his not
inconsiderable talents to this
knockabout comedy, as a pilot
marooned on a desert island with
high-and-mighty magazine editor
Anne Heche.
Heche is an ambitious decisive
New York girl, taking a week off
with her boyfriend in Tahiti. To jus-
tify the holiday, she agrees to help
her magazine out by covering a
story on a neighbouring island.
Enter the Fordster, the only pilot
available available, a laid-back
heavy drinker with whom she
shares a mutual dislike. But Heche
has no choice and he can't refuse
the money.
And, of course, this being the
movies, the plane then decides to
crash land on a remote island,
deep in the Pacific. Abandoned and
with no hope of rescue, the pair are
forced to put aside their antago-
nism in order to survive. As the
days go by, they learn to like each
other, until finally....
Of course, it all sounds utterly
predictable (and it probably is), but
that's hardly the point. The mix of
Ford, sparky comedy, the regula-
tion action quotient and a bizzare
combination of stars (Anne Heche
is probably most famous for being
Ellen DeGenres girlfriend) should
see Six Days, Seven Nights firmly
ensconced in the box office charts,
returning a happy profit. Moreover,
the promise of seeing Harrison
Ford try his hand at the style of
lighthearted comedy preferred by
director Reitman (the man behind
Ghostbusters, Twins, Space Jam
etc.) is surely worth the price of
admission alone.
M
oving into the colder
months, the blockbusters
still keep on coming, with
destruction fest Armageddon pen-
cilled in for release .... Current US
sensation The Truman Show stars
Jim Carrey in his first "serious"
role. He is Truman Burbank, star of
the world's most popular TV show
- but he doesn't know he's on TV.
His entire life has all been a sham
and his wife, his friends and his
parents are all actors .... Toy Story
style effects return in Small
Soldiers, with Kirsten Dunst
caught-up in a war between two
factions of toy soldiers .... The
worrying prospect of a live action
version of Cinderella hits the multi-
plexes, with the unlikely casting of
Drew Barrymore as the much put-
upon Cinders .... Hitchcock's Dial
m for Murder is remade as A
Perfect Murder, with Andrew
Davies (The Fugitive, Chain
Reaction) in the director's chair.
Gwyneth Paltrow stars in role
Grace Kelly made her own .... John
McTiernan (Die Hard) steps in to
direct The 13th Warrior, the latest
Michael Chrichton adaptation to
hit the big screen. Battles featuring
Viking warriors taking on
Neanderthal cannibals promises a
healthy gore quotient. And appar-
ently it's all based on a true story
.... Disney puts a different spin on
old folk tales with Mulan, an
ancient Chinese tale given the ani-
mation treatment. Advance word
suggests that the Mousedom may
finally be back on track after their
recent shoddy efforts .... Nicholas
Cage is a rogue cop, forced to
shoot an awful lot of bad guys in
order to save the day in Snake
Eyes, the latest from Brian de
Palma .... As Bryan Singer's first
stint in the director's chair since
the brilliant Usual Suspects, Apt
Pupil promises to be a source of
much media attention, particularly
as it's adapted from a Stephen
King novel .... However, it's up
against serious horror opposition,
in the form The Exorcist, it's still
banned on video, so see this
object lesson in film-making while
you can .... Hugh Grant returns to
the comedy fold in Mickey Blue
Eyes. Hilarious consequences
ensue when he discovers that his
girlfriend's dad is the Godfather.
