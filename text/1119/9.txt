COLUMNS 24 June 1998

have whiled away many an evening
talking with friends about the truly
magnificent work of Albert Einstein.
I have a big poster of him on my
wall, and whenever there is a pro-
gramme about him on TV I wear my
special Einstein wig, which is one of
my most treasured possessions.
This is a particularly exciting
time of year for avid science fans,
because the exams bring the
promise of glory and success. I for
one get worked up into a state of
frenzied excitement at the thought
that questions relating to the work
of my greatest hero might come up
this year. I'm sure I speak for thou-
sands of other students when I say
that May and June are definitely the
most thrilling months in the calen-
dar.
Indeed, the exam period is
such a major event that it can be
used to justify the inclusion of all
manner of pointless statistics: dur-
ing the summer term, 5,000 stu-
dents of all nationalities will take
approximately 250 exams at
venues all across the campus.
They will use 6,479 answer books
and produce 11,500 buckets of
cold sweat, while that guy who
always says You have five minutes
remaining', will have walked a dis-
tance of 539 miles supplying extra
answer books. Imperial College
Catering are expecting an extra Â£2
million in revenue from the sale of
as many as 200 JCR sandwiches.
As we enter the final weeks
before the exams, a lot is at stake:
success brings glory and the poten-
tial of huge financial gain, while fail-
ure brings a year of derision from
your colleagues and the almost cer-
tain sacking of tutors and lecturers.
So it is natural for excitement to
reach fever pitch. It is quite normal
to see large crowds gathering out-
side the hall before an exam, chant-
ing Faraday's Law of Induction and
waving banners with Schrodinger's
equation written on them, their
faces painted with various assort-
ments of Greek letters.
Those who can't actually be
there stay at home with a few
mates and drink copious amounts
of lager. Often, they start singing
raucously about relativity whilst
browsing through illicit textbooks.
They also watch Open University
programmes on TV with the sound
turned up very loud, cheering wild-

these ugly scenes would once again

essentially harmless and are just
out for a good time. However, in
recent years we have seen the
emergence of a new and highly
threatening phenomenon: science
hooliganism. Some students take
things too far and are determined
to use what should be an enjoyable
day out as an excuse for violence
and destruction. Last year, there
were a number of disturbing inci-
dents at our College.
One night, a group of drunken
physics students, using the name
Einstein's Army, scrawled 'E = mc2'
all over the front of the
Biochemistry building in red paint.
In retaliation, a gang of thugs call-
ing themselves the Louis Pasteur
Appreciation Society raided the
Physics Department in the early
hours of the morning and drew
large protein molecules on the
blackboard in the main lecture the-
atre. Things came to a head when
an exam had to be called off after a
violent confrontation between the
two groups. Many innocent candi-
dates were hurt after invigilators in
riot gear were called in to break up
the disturbance. St John's
Ambulance crews were kept busy
for several hours treating head
injuries from flying calculators and
test tubes. Fighting also spilled over
into central London, as drunken
gangs of hooligans went on the
rampage. Two such groups met on
the Northern line and wrecked a
whole train. Regular commuters
were only too glad to pitch in and
lend a hand.

fans, who planned to run riot all
over the campus wearing prosthet-
ic beards, looking for rival fans to
beat up. Mark Walsh, of the Official
james Clerk Maxwell Fan Club, said,
'Naturally we distance ourselves
from this kind of behaviour.
Obviously it's OK to get a few beers
in while reciting your best loved
equations, but this kind of mindless
barbarism brings the whole of sci-
ence into disrepute.'
The Registry was alerted, and
this year, stringent measures have
been taken to prevent a repetition
of previous trouble. Members of
staff have been given the authority
to detain any student seen carrying
large numbers of textbooks in a
suspicious manner, and known
troublemakers have had special
codes imprinted on their
swipecards to stop them gaining
entry to the more important
papers. Exam halls and lecture the-
atres have been declared alcohol-
free zones. However, many law-
abiding science fans see this as an
infringement of civil liberties and
object to being 'treated like animals'
by heavy-handed invigilators. But it
is a sad fact that this may be the
only way to stop friendly rivalry
from escalating into all-out war as
we approach the climax of the aca-
demic year.
