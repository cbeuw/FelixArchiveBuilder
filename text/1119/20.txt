How is Feli* going to be produced nexc year?
M y end of things will be the same as always:
people write for their sub-editors w h o fill the
pages and ! make sure that everything keeps
happening al the right time. For the first time in
several yea;',, felix will probably be printed out-
side ICLI. This has advantages as well as draw-
backs. It will be easier to d o thiiigs like full
colour but won't be as versatile and probably not
as reliable as Inky. Hopefully it should remain a
thirty-something page newspaper with more
than a couple of pages of news.
Tell me about the new office?
I wish I could. It is going to be on one or other
side of the Beit Q u a d arch, hopefully in what is
now the biology c o m m o n r o o m . Natural light

Whist is your opinion of the way that IC is run?
M o r e emphasis at IC seems to be given to keep

direct consequence of being tied so closely to
