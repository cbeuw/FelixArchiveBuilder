WELCOME TO THE HUMAN EMBRACE
Arrogant, brilliant, over-rated, best debut since The Stone Roses, a cynical attempt to occupy the middle ground created by Oasis and The Verve.
Embrace's album has caused quite a stir amongst fans of music. We let Dennis and Ed tell us what they think....
EMBRACE
The Good Will Out
C
aught in a wave of prema-
ture adulation, Embrace
look to be set up for quite a
confrontation with the most fickle
of corporations known to man:
You, the British public. With all the
surrounding hype, Embrace will
stand or fall on their debut, which
has already drawn comparison with
The Stone Roses and Definitely
Maybe. This may c o m e across as a
bit harsh on their career should
they fall short of the mark but it's
the M c N a m a r a s and C o . that have
engineered this coming together.
Danny's already admitted that he
boasted before recording the
album that it was going to be fan-
tastically g o o d in order to push
himself to make sure that it was.
A n d it is.
Truly, it is. You're greeted with
forty-odd seconds of orchestral
tuning, gradually rising in volume.
There's s o m e indistinguishable
chatter, a rattle of kettle drums and
the now familiar All You Good Good
People bursts its way out of the
speakers and into your ears. It's
here where a lot of people will have
to start making decisions about
how they feel while Danny adds
some persuasive advice, 'Lose all
your fears. They're keeping y o u
d o w n . You won't have to fake it
while I'm around. All you g o o d
g o o d people, listen to me.' Did
somebody say epic? There must
have been a 'Big Chorus' switch in
the recording studio that's been
w e d g e d d o w n with copies of vari-
ous music press publications. My
Weakness Is None Of Your
Business, Come Back To What You
Know and One Big Family. They all
resonate with anthemic grandeur.
It's all a bit personal, as well.
Lyrically, you can spot their ideas
and beliefs very quickly. The line,
"The g o o d will c o m e out," features
in three different songs. "Don't
w a n n a let y o u d o w n , " (My
Weakness Is...) and "I'll never let
you d o w n , " (Come Back To... and
Fireworks) demonstrate their c o m -
mitment to not disappointing peo-
ple. A s well as the vulnerable side,
there's also the constant reminder
that we're here to make the most
and best of things: 'If you're alive,
then why aren't y o u living?' (1 Want
The World), 'The view's too g o o d
to jump. N o w let me talk you
d o w n . ' (You've Got To Say Yes) and
the triumphant, 'It's the way I feel!'
(The Last Cas)
The Good Will Out is a touch-
ing album crammed with at least
seven or eight pure gems of which
Retread, Higher Sights and That's
All Changed Forever are probably
the best. The only lulls on the e m o -
tional plane come ironically in the
more hedonistic numbers. It's not
'Group hug, anyone?'
that they can't pull them off, it's
just that other bands that begin
with the letter O would probably be
able to be more fierce about it.
However, this is splitting hairs. This
is a shamelessly optimistic album
that is both musically grand and
lyrically beautiful. Journalists, cast
aside your cool attitudes. Cynics,
open your hearts. Fellow people,
open your ears. Embrace Embrace
and rejoice! EJ

LOST IN MUSICAL DISGRACE
EMBRACE
The Gods Will Shout No Stars
A
few points before I listen to
the album. Apparently, 1997
was a great year for British
music. The Verve and Radiohead
finally hit the big time, The Prodigy
and Oasis went supernova and
Radio 1 told us about exciting new
bands such as M a n s u n , Hurricane
#1 but mostly Embrace. Over 12
months ago Steve Lamacq called
them "The greatest find of the
year." I assumed he must have
been taking the piss w h e n he
played a d e m o of All You Good
Good People, for what followed
was a load of distorted guitars
underneath a tone deaf singer with
a c o l d . W h e n it emerged that M r .
Evening Session was being sincere,
comments of the 'I could sing bet-
ter than that' variety could be heard
emanating from my m o u t h . So
began my ill-fated relationship with
Embrace, it seems strange that so
many people are not only con-
vinced that Danny M c N a m a r a isn't
tone deaf but is actually a fantastic
singer. H e claims that, 'I could sing
like Gary Barlow if 1 wanted to' (by
which he means in tune) opting
instead for a voice that, you know,
means it. Listen, Danny, thousands
of people 'mean it' when they sing
in Karaoke bars, but it counts for
nothing if you can't hit the notes.
The album cover shows Embrace in
typical self-loving fashion: their
high-held heads shadowed as they
hold back the force of the sunshine.
I mean, G o d ' s gotta c o m e from
s o m e w h e r e , so w h y not
Huddersfield? Anyway, on to the
music.
Embrace r e - w o r k e d All You
Good Good People last Christmas
with overblown orchestral
enhancements. In cliched style, the
song starts softly and gradually
builds to a climax near the end,
then finishing all quiet and sub-
dued. It received a totally unde-
served Top 10 hit. A n d why mess
with a winning formula? Recent sin-
gle Come Back To What You Know
follows exactly the same path (the
vocals are a bit better: he's still
tone deaf but at least his cold has
gone) as, in fact, does the whole of
their new album. Debut albums are
first attempts to show the world
what you're about. They shouldn't
take 15 months to record (lack of
ideas, lads?) and should show at
least a bit of variety. The problem is
that every song is either a near car-
bon copy of AYGCP (re-worked
again for the album; still rubbish)
or, like One Big Family, a bit more
shouty. Hearing one Embrace song
is bad enough, but being subjected
to a m o n o t o n o u s album-full is
painful. Embrace's grandiose style
has gained them comparisons to
Oasis, but in truth they share more
with Shed Seven (both musically
and vocally). W h e n Embrace are
called upon to produce a follow-up
album, the world will finally realise
how pathetic the group are - a pub
band trying to take o n the world.
Their songs lack any true feeling; a
fault that they have tried to make
up for by dropping syrupy strings
everywhere. But strings are no sub-
stitute for e m o t i o n . Save your
money people and listen to some
debuts that y o u already know are
of established quality. 0
