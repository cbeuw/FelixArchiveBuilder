Letters to Felix...
GENUINE LETTER
Dear Felix,
Hmmm. 1 had always thought
Simon Baker as mearly a chemistry
student with a big mouth. But now
it turns out that he's a world-class
economist as well. Wow, what a
man!
Yours, A. R. Seface
HEEPS 'FUCKED'
Sir,
As a regular contributor, 1 have
in my three years at Imperial so far
restrained from correspondence
with the letters page. This being
the last issue of the year and, if my
exams were as bad as they may
well have been, potentially my last,
1 pray your indulgence in allowing
me few words, if I may, on the
inaugural ICU Summer Ball. 1 wish
to thank the organising team for an
outstanding achievement; their
work was exemplary and deserves
reward. The Alexandra Palace was
a wonderful venue, the food out-
standing and the entertainment
superb. Minor gripes, though, as all
good letters must have. The bus
company, who promised to send
sixteen buses, provided only eight.
This made transport more than a
little trying. My main reason for
writing though, was the appaling
behaviour of our outgoing
President, Mr Andrew Heeps. After
a competent and largely successful
year in office, and a pleasing post
after-dinner speech thanking the
organisers, Mr Heeps' conduct
grew steadily worse. Leching over
the outgoing ICSM President (Miss
Katie Armstrong) for the majority of
the night, his amorous attentions
turned to his male company, and
he was seen with his tongue down
the throat of, amongst others, both
Deputy Presidents, a ULU
Sabbatical, the Publication Board
chair, the Council Chair and unfor-
tunately, this unfortunate corre-
spondent. He sang coarse songs
and danced solo for the entire
return coach journey, and was
described by one friend as being
"utterly, utterly, utterly fucked. The
man could not have been any more
drunk." Is this the proper behaviour
of an ambassador for our Union?
Or the sad demise which many
thought would accompany the
gradual move back to the rigours of
medical studies? 1 think that we
should be told. Good luck Andy:
Remember; I have the negatives,
let's talk business.
Ever yours,
Jonathan Trout, Features Editor

MINIMUM WAGE
RIP-OFF
Dear Felix,
Last week's announcement by
Margaret Beckett that the mini-
mum wage will be £3.60 for most
workers but only £3.00 for those
between 18 and 21 is another kick
in the balls for us youths'.
Due to be 'phased in' between
next April and June 2000, this pro-
posal will affect some vulnerable
groups e.g. students, those trying
to hold down a starting job or even
raise a young family (those on the
New Deal will get something differ-
ent again). So which of these is
only worth £3.00 an hour? Even the
Union's basic rate is £3.65 and
that's not taxed.
Young people have always been
exploited (re: the child labour
uproars) but to institutionalise this
situation is criminal. It sounds like
Mrs Beckett will shortly be getting
her come-uppance but like most
big organised crime the bosses will
probably continue to live unchal-
lenged in numbers 10 and 11.
Yours, Antoine Jeanson
DIVINE
ENGINEERING
Sir
The last few weeks have seen
the Genetic Engineering debate
increase in pace, thanks largely to
some unhelpful comments by HRH
Prince Charles. Denouncing the
science of genetics as playing God
is hardly accurate and, in my mind,
an insult to monotheistic religions.
Does the Prince think medical
intervention at car accidents is also
a little too divine? Or, like much of
the population, is he simply dis-
missing something as evil because
he fails to understand it? Genetic
Engineering, like all new technolo-
gies, has the potential to be mis-
used. It also holds the possibility
of reducing disease and hunger
throughout the world, something I
hope the Prince would applaud,
yours as a biologist,
