T
he Bootfreaks have returned
repackaged and with one
extra, as Ether. Originally
intended to be a boy band, they
have gone indie, with the quirkiest
lead singers (Rory Meredith winner
of the John Lennon Song writing
Scholarship) around. To coincide
with the launch of their album, they
have also released the single Best
Friend, what the band considered
1
to be their crossover hit, to do what
Alright did for Supergrass. This is a
very untypical song from the album
and promotes a stereotype that
isn't true in the least.
She Could Fly, in contrast, man-
ages to hit the balance of pop and
near rock. The band somehow
manage to create a completely full
sound with only a three piece fol-
lowed by a Ben Folds Five-style
piano rhythm and an Elvis Costello
voice. After such a strong opening
track, the rest of the album is
pushed to deliver but only / Love
Her Anyway comes close as an
anti-climaxing love song.
The first album may be more of
a lesson to them than a maker or
• breaker. A few singles that only
your die hard fans can't launch an
album and neither can one song
that has been written in an attempt
to tap into the feel of the charts.
They are, however, the fullest
sounding three piece around and if
they can exploit this, there's noth-
ing to stop them.

POP TARTS
Woman is the Fuehrer of
the World
T
he Germans. They're famous
for efficiency. Frankfurters,
penalty shoot-outs, their
sense of (ahem) humour and
poppy little lo-fi punk outfits. OK,
maybe not but that's what the Pop
Tarts are. Woman is the Fuehrer of
W
hy fix what ain't broke? That's certainly the
ethic that Garbage have employed with this
album. With their last offering, Garbage
gave the world an interesting new band format that
produced some memorable classics like Milk and
Queer. Three 'old' producers and one "young' vocal
talent that brought the whole sleazy sound together
brilliantly. Samples and loops littered the record and
the band lent themselves very well to re-mixes that,
quite often, surpassed the originals.
And that's the same with Version 2.0. Again, sam-
ples and loops cut through the heavy guitars but only
Push It reclaims the glories of the past. The rest of the
album is good, but tends to merge into one in the
search for something new and different. It's no dirge,
but it does get a bit tiring listening to Shirley's voice
rasping through more effects than you could possibly
imagine. A couple of simpler tracks that didn't rely so
much on electronics would have provided a great con-
trast to the rest of the album. More than anything, it
would outline more of their talent.
But instead of complaining, join me in welcoming
back the innovators of the goth/dance/indie/rock
sound. Alok.
the World could be described as a
sort of mix between our very own
Kenickie and the All-American
female trio, Sleater-Kinney. Not as
glossy and professionally produced
as Kenickie but not quite as rough
and emotionally raw as Sleater-
Kinney. This could probably be put
down to the fact that they're not
singing in their native tongue for a
portion of the time. It's a shame
really, as the German language is
probably well suited to punk with
its pronunciation of harsh conso-
nants.
Saying this, there are several
tracks with German titles and a
couple sung in the Deutsche lingo.
There's OK Vollgas, where the cho-
rus consists of one person just say-
ing 'OK in a quirky German accent
and another screaming 'Vollgas'.
Apparently, it's the equivalent of
saying, 'Hit the gas.' or 'Floor it.'
And they admirably do stick their
engine into overdrive on this track
and on Hallo Franzi and So'n
Scheiss which roughly translates to
'So Shit!' Others worthy of mention
are Buro and Kindheit Jugend Sex,
Office and Childhood Youthful Sex
respectively. Basically what you've
got here is ten short, catchy and
noisy songs. It's not really offensive
and it isn't going to start a series of
riots in the German capital.
However, it is a nice little snack
that you can eat between major
pop punk releases without spoiling
your appetite. E3 Dennis.
TOM WAITS
Beautiful Maladies
T
his enormous compilation of
twenty two tracks has been
released under the subtitle
"the Island years", something of a
boast from the record company
which has allowed Waits to pro-
duce some of his most strange and
twisted material to date. Tom
Waits is a prolific artist, who has
experimented with a wide variety of
musical styles from swamp blues to
Rio samba, touching all of them
with his unmistakable (and pretty
disturbing) presence. It's clear from
the subject matter of these songs
that Nick Cave owes Waits a huge
debt, as they deliver a succession
of pimps, murderers, messianic
saviours and whiskey priests. Most
striking, however, is the voice. 80-
a- day rough with a Southern drawl,
he still manages to contort his vocal
chords in displays of cunning mim-
icry. On The Black Rider, he's the
spit of Marlene Deitrich groaning
away in a smoky Berlin nightclub to
a theme lifted directly from The
Flintstones ('We'll have a gay old
time'). Later he's King Louis from
The Jungle Book singing about a
stop-over in the most dangerous
port in the world, 'Singapore'. I can
smell the salt, the wet ropes and
rotting meat as he tells us ' The cap-
tain is a one-armed dwarf! He's
throwing dice along the wharf! In
the land of the blind the one-eyed
man is king".
Musically, there's more than a
hint of Beefheart experimentalism
at work, and Waits is at his best
when perverting blues and jazz,
such as on the strangled Billie
Holliday moan of Temptation. He is
just as convincing when he
acknowledges the roots of his
music in the old blues standard,
Jesus Gonna Be Here, a morbid
anticipation of the final Judgement
trump. Similarly, his love for shit-
kicking folk music is clear in / Don't
Wanna Crow Old and Cold Cold
Ground, both of which could be
from the Shane MacGowan canon.
But I have to give special mention
to Frank's Wild Years, an old
favourite riddled with black
humour. Waits plays the lounge bar
sot, telling how his good friend
Frank 'Settled down out in the val-
ley I Hung his wild years on the nail
he drove through his wife's fore-
head She was a spent piece of
used jet-trash, made good Bloody
Marys, kept her mouth shut most
of the time, had a little Chihuahua
named Carlos that had some kinda
skin disease and was totally blind
.... they were so happy. Frank's
story alone is sufficient reason to
kill yourself getting a copy of this
album, but if you ask real nice, Tom
may well do it for you. H
