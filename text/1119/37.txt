PRIMARY COLOURS
Starring: )ohn Travolta, E m m a T h o m p s o n
Director: M i k e Nichols -k-k-k
J
ohn Travolta, overweight a n d
greying, is governor Jack
Stanton, a doughnut chomping,
womanising, q u i c k - t e m p e r e d
politician with skeletons climbing
out of every closet, including a
t a m p e r e d police record a n d
w o m e n accusing him of adultery.
His wife, Susan, (a perfectly
accented E m m a Thompson) is a
no-nonsense lawyer determined to
make him president w h o refuses to
believe the scandals.
If this description makes y o u
think of Bill a n d Hilary Clinton, then
you wouldn't be t o o far from the
mark. Based o n the novel of the
same name, Primary Colours is a
"completely fictitious" account of
the presidential campaign of a gov-
ernor of an u n n a m e d southern
state, and the allegations that con-
stantly hamper his attempt to
become president.
W e witness the story through
the eyes of their n e w campaign
manager, Henry Burton, an idealis-
tic y o u n g black m a n , desperate to
find something to believe in. The
No, of course they're not Bill and Hilary. Oh no.
film unfolds around h i m a n d his
discovery of the real world of poli-
tics, as w e see the w a y a governor
runs for office and the people w h o
are part of the frenzy.
Adrian Lester, a y o u n g British
actor, does a fine job of playing the
film's pivoting character, standing
up admirably to the t w o excellent
leads, and the supporting cast are
all o n t o p form, from Billy B o b
Thornton's troublesome political
strategist to Kathy Bates' fiercely
loyal campaign trouble-shooter.
M i k e N i c h o l s directs with
aplomb, not distracting a strong
story with t o o many showy cine-
matic flourishes. With an overly
long and a dragging last act, it is
hard to see what appeal such a film
would have in this country, but
Primary Colours is an intelligent
and well-made look at politics in
the US, and an alternative to the
traditional brainless blockbuster.Il

STAR PROFILE:
JOHN
TRAVOLTA
J
ohn Travolta represents that
rarest of all Hollywood resi-
dents - the star w h o success-
fully makes a comeback - and for
that alone he deserves enduring
recognition.
Having found fame in the sev-
enties, capturing the feel of a gen-
eration in disco classics Saturday
Night Fever and Crease, he all but
disappeared during the eighties,
only to return to A-list status
thanks to Pulp Fiction. Alongside
co-stars Samuel L Jackson U m a
Thurman a n d Ving Rhames, he
shot to nineties success courtesy
of Tarantino's masterpiece.
As a result, the m a n w h o once
admitted he could see out the rest
of his days in the increasingly sick-
ening Look Who's Talking fran-
chise is n o w worth $ 2 0 million a
picture. Thus, he can c o m m a n d
lead roles in big studio produc-
tions such as this month's Primary
Colours and recent hits such as
Mad City and the brilliant Face/Off.
This m a y all sound a far cry
from Travolta's cinematic roots,
yet if y o u w a t c h Saturday Night
Fever again, the ease with which
he slips into the gritty, swearing,
violent persona of Tony shows the
first signs of his future career. A n d
of course, his first mainstream
movie was Carrie....
Yet the real Travolta is a far cry
form the hell-raisers he tends to
portray o n screen. The forty-two
year old star is married to actress
Kelly Preston, has a four year o l d
daughter named Jet, and is a lead-
ing proponent of the "Church of
Scientology".
Harrison Ford action comedy Six
Days, Seven Nights. H o l l y w o o d ' s
most bankable star is a pilot w h o
crash lands o n a desert island with
only Anne Heche for company.
Unsurprisingly, romantic entangle-
ments ensue.
To win tickets, simply tell us:
In what seminal Vietnam story
does Harrison Ford appear in a
supporting role?
