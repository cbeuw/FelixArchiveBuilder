SMASHING PUMPKINS
MUSIC 24 June 1998
Adore ****'/2
I
t's been a long two years since
the Pumpkins released their last
album, Mellon Collie and the
Infinite Sadness, and I have been
waiting with bated breath for Adore
to hit the streets. The 'Pumpkins
haven't really been up to m u c h
since Mellon Collie, only releasing
the m e d i o c r e The End is the
Beginning is the End for the Batman
soundtrack. The band was comis-
sioned to d o the complete sound-
track, but at the last minute their
contibutions were tossed aside
leaving only the aforementioned
single. Billy Corgan, the lead
singer, on the other hand, has been
fairly busy by himself composing
for the Ransom soundtrack, and
James lha has released a solo
album of what sounded like light
country music and I advise people
to steer clear of it.
Adore is a complete change in
tack for the s o u n d of the
'Pumpkins. This has been
attibuted, by many critics, to Billy's
mother dying, his marriage break-
ing up, the dismissal of the band's
drummer and the death of their
keyboard player from a heroin
overdose. I personally feel that it is
just the band exploring another
facet of their musical genius. O n a
recent TV interview the band had
said that they felt that all of their
work since the release of Cish, their
first album, had been forced to stay
in the same vein by their record
label executives. Billy feels that the
band has an essentially orchestral
core and they certainly explored
this in the album. Gone is the
bleeding sore of hate and anger
that earmarked most of Mellon
Collie and certainly all of the sec-
ond C D , Starlight to Twilight. What
has emerged is an album which is
much more mellow, even if it is a
bit introspective and gloomy. It has
a rich variety of pianos, strings and
a whole variety of instruments usu-
ally associated with the Royal
Albert Hall rather than the mental
m o s h pits of ' P u m p k i n s ' gigs.
What they have also made use of
are drum loops giving some of the
tracks a distinctly dance-y feel,
which works surprisingly well with
Appels and Oranjes, the excellent
Ava Adore and the darkly brilliant
Pug being the best examples.
Unfortunately, in searching for
a new sound or as they put it,
exposing their core, the band has
lost some of the magic gained by
the use of a hugely distorted guitar
sound and monumental overdub-
bing of up to 4 0 separate record-
ings of slightly different guitar riffs
on the same track. Despite this,
the album is amazing if not quite
up to the standard of Siamese
Dream and Mellon Collie and y o u
don't have to listen to any of James
lha's songs either, w h i c h is a
bonus. I thoroughly recommend
this a l b u m to anyone w h o is
already a 'Pumpkins fan, or w h o
just likes a bit of something slightly
heavier than awful c o m m e r c i a l
rock. Just as something to push
the frontiers of music a seventeen
second track is included, imagina-
tively titled 17, at the end of the
album. Billy and the band give the
execs, the birdie. EI

'Pumpkins in the house! Well, just
outside, actually.

ometime, somewhere in my
past, 1 drank bottles of 20-
20, got pissed off at anything
and anyone and always, without
fail, believed that I was right about
everything. 1 also listened to
Anthrax, M e g a d e t h and Slayer.
Now, I'm quite partial to a pint of
Caffrey's, get pissed of at slightly
less stuff and always, without fail,
believe that I'm right about every-
thing. I d o not, however, listen to
the aforementioned bands any-
more. Possession of an acoustic
guitar has thrown me into more of
a Bob Dylan/Embrace/ Bernard
Butler category. M a y b e I'm wrong.
M a y b e 1 s h o u l d have never
changed the way 1 listen. Perhaps
this Slayer album will pull me back
into the clutches of heavy/
thrash/speed/death or whatever
type of metal Slayer fall into nowa-
days. Something tells me though
that this is unlikely to happen.
Listening to the screaming,
shouting and seven thousand notes
a second soloing, I could feel my
senses dulling while my creative
thoughts scrambled for the exit

sign in my head. 1 must admit
Richard and Judy were o n the telly
but the sound was turned d o w n so
their effect was minimal. N o , it was
definitely the monotonic nature of
Slayer that was responsible for my
mind being numbed. Song titles
like Stain of Mind, Death's Head,
Screaming From the Sky, In The
Name of Cod and Perversions of
Pain are all g o o d indications of the
sort of sound you're likely to let
your eardrums be battered with.
To get a balanced opinion, 1
d e c i d e d to ask s o m e friends,
acquaintances and strangers what
they thought of the Slayer sound.
What follows is a collection of their
responses: fuckin' terrible, horrible,
the masters, grotesque, disgusting,
fuckin' gods, 1 feel sick, fantastic
and head-splittingly s p l e n d i d .
Slayer seem to have a knack of
polarising camps so it really is your
decision to make. I made mine
early on in the album but gave
them one star for old times'
sake. EJ

M
elys are a new four piece
band from Wales, w h o
have been signed to the
same label as Gorky's Zygotic
M y n c i . They mix simple melodies
with gentle St Ettiene style synth
beats and borrow some experi-
mental keyboard w o r k from
Stereolab to create a unique mel-
low electro-folk sound. The music
is built around the delicate voice of
Angela Parker, w h o s e angelic
vocals conceal dark and often dis-
turbing lyrics. '1 want to kill him,
gouge out his eyes, write my name
across his face, with Stanley
knife...' is just part of the seething
plan of revenge outlined in Acid
Queen. Accompaniment is provid-
ed by synthesisers, guitar, and a
multitude of strange electronic
effects, which are fused into sim-
ple rhythms and melodies that per-
fectly c o m p l e m e n t the fragile
vocals.
It is unfortunate that M e l y s d o
not really fit in with the current
musical fashions and will probably
not get much airplay, as the tracks
on the album are of a very high
standard. Diwifir, a haunting
melody sung in a mixture of Welsh
and English, is a track that will get
stuck in your head for days, while
Lemming combines sleigh-bells
and electro-twangs with wonder-
fully psychotic lyrics. M y favourite
tracks on the album have to be the
beautiful acoustic When You Put
Leonard Cohen On telling the sad
tale of a couple drifting apart and
the final track Matryoshka which
adds the Llanrwst M a l e Voice Choir
to a vast electronic ocean of swish-
es, buzzing, echoes and distortion.
Rumours and Curses is a promising
debut album and I would recom-
mend it to anyone disillusioned
with the same old guitar bands.
Buy it now and be,smug when they
appear on Jools Holland.El
