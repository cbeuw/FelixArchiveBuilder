DEGREES, THE FELIX BOOKS TEAM HAVE COMPILED A LIST OF THE BEST BOOKS TO
TRYIN' TO
SLEEP IN THE
BED YOU MADE
DeBerry Grant
This book is terrible. Basically, it's
pulp fiction from the States where
all the characters are black people
making an impression on a pre-
dominantly white US society. This
is the only g o o d thing about the
book; it touches on the miserable
life that poor people can have in
the slum-suburbs of N e w York. In
itself the book is well written, with
a g o o d ear for street slang and
vaguely realistic characters, but is
ultimately let d o w n by the slushy
plot. There's loads of action in the
book; fires, deaths, abortions,
marriages, all hurriedly dealt with.
The two soul sisters both discover
the hollowness of love and the
emptiness of their dreams, it isn't
just blood that makes w o m e n sis-
ters. As I said, this book is really
poor.
It's very readable, however;
much to my irritation I couldn't put
it d o w n , I read it on the bus, at
meals, in lectures, between tutori-
als, whenever 1 had a moment. 1
even stayed up late to finish it, and
I haven't done that in a long time.
This is a beach or airport novel, not
as serious read, it's light, frothy,
pleasant with a feel-good ending,
but is ultimately a terrible book.

PARADISE
Toni Morrison
This is a very difficult book, explor-
ing our views on race, gender and
the void between g o o d and evil.
Four w o m e n are shot dead by nine
men in a seemingly unprovoked
attack. Were they shot because
they are evil, because the men
want to suppress any w o m e n w h o
stand out from the c r o w d , or
because they are willfully mis-
understood by a small town w h o
like to remain blinkered? There are
no easy answers to these ques-
tions, and the book doesn't insult
our intelligence by providing any.
This is Toni Morrison's first
book since winning the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 1993 and is a reg-
ular four de force. She writes with
amazing clarity and fluency, and
her ideas are beautifully
expressed. Right from the first sen-
tence, (They shoot the white girl
first), we are flung into a difficult
and dangerous w o r l d , full of
inequalities both between races
and sexes. By forcing us to con-
front our o w n racism, she presents
us with a challenging read which is
ultimately extremely enjoyable.

TWO FOR THE
LIONS
Lindsay Davis
This is the latest bestseller in the
M a r c u s Didius Falco series.
Devotees will k n o w what to
expect, as Falco, Helena Justina
and julia Justinilla travel to North
Africa to unravel the mysterious
death of a champion criminal eat-
ing lion, in company with Famia,
Falco's alcoholic brother-in-law,
Thalia, the super-tough circus
manager and Jason the sleepy
python. Whilst they're there, they
uncover scandalous behaviour in
the gladiator world.
Will Camillus Justinus, Helena's
younger brother, end up skewered
by the gladiator with the large
spear? Will Falco manage to solve
the crimes before the Emperor
Vespasian loses patience and
recalls him to Rome? Will Falco
manage to lose his partner
Ancrites without incurring the
wrath of his mother?
It's worth reading if you're a
fan, and is very enjoyable. If you
haven't read anything by Lindsay
Davis, then it won't really appeal to
you. Anyone with only a glancing
interest in Ancient Rome or crime
fiction will enjoy this series: the
first is The Silver Pigs and is avail-
able in paperback from Century
Books.

CEREUS BLOOMS
AT NIGHT
Shani Mootoo
This is not a book 1 would have vol-
untarily chosen. It is an unusual
book about love, separation and
alienation. The plot is twisted, with
a small town feel, where everyone
knows everyone else, and doesn't
have that high an opinion of him or
her.
As everyone knew, M a l a
Ramchandin was mad, and most
people were slightly afraid of her.
N o one ever bothered to discover
the reason for her madness, except
for Tyler, the only male nurse on
the island, with his uncomfortable
feeling of being in the wrong body.
He narrates this evocative story of
sexual and mental abuse, of one
woman's slow collapse into total
insanity.
This is a sensitive and thought-
ful book, dealing delicately with
controversial issues such as father-
daughter incest, exploring gender
identity and violence in a celebra-
tion of the capacity to love, and to
survive despite immense cruelty
and black despair. Unfortunately,
the plot rather tails out, leaving one
with a strong sense of disappoint-
ment.
