THE BIG SUMMER PREVIEW
LOST IN SPACE
W
ith Saving Private Ryan
the only big Hollywood
offering this month, it's
tie for all the indie films to emerge
from hiding ... Terry Gilliam meets
hunter S Thopmson to produce the
trippiest movie you've seen in
years, Fear and Loathing In Las
Vegas. Jonny Depp plays the drug-
fuelled writer, journeying across
the mid-west in search of the
American Dream .... Running it
close for the tittle of strangest con-
cept of the year is Velvet
Goldmine, a roadmovie following a
70's glam-rock band and starring
Ewan McGregor and Eddie Izzard.
Personally, I can't wait .... Hot on
it's heels comes Still Crazy, which
follows the reunion of a glam rock
group, twenty years after their
heyday. Billy Connolly, Stephen
Rea and jimmy Nail star .... Back
on the mainstream path, Gibson
and Glover return in Lethal
Weapon 4. Expect huge explo-
sions, massive body count and
absolutely no pretensions of plot.
Joe Pesci and Rene Russo also
return .... Species 2 is this sum-
mer's other big studio sequel, with
Natasha Henstridge returning as
the killer alien babe. This time
around, the top scientists create a
"good" Natasha to destroy a
Martian foe .... Richard
Attenborough retreads the life of
Elizabeth (the First, that is) with an
all-star cast including Cate
Blanchett and Eric Cantona. He
suggests she wasn't the "Virgin
Queen" that history records, so
expect controversy .... What Rats
Won't Do is another British court-
room based entry .... With Elmore
Leonard novels currently guaran-
teed box-office gold (Get Shorty,
Jackie Brown) Out of Sight may
finally represent George Clooney's
break into the big-time. Steven
Soderbergh (Sex, lies and
Videotape) returns from the dead
to direct .... The wonderfully titled
Men With Guns charts the history
of the Mexican guerrilla war, and is
(somewhat impressively) delivered
in a mix of six different languages
.... Strangest of all, Wesley Snipes
stars as the eponymous half-man
half-vampire in Blade, looking to
avenge his mothers death at the
hands of Stephen Dorff.
Stars: William Hurt, Matt Le Blanc,
Gary Oldman
Director: Stephen Hopkins

T
ake one hit sixties sci-fi serial
with a big cult following, ditch
the entire style of the original
and, hey presto, you've got a sure-
fire hit on your hands - how many
times have we seen that premise in
recent years?
Looked at from an alternative
point of view, Lost in Space
promises stunning visuals, big
explosions and a top class adrena-
line rush. Once again, special
effects wizzardry has been pushed
to new limits, including a robot
which weighs in at one and a half
tonnes, and is operated by eight
people, and one member of the
cast who has been entirely com-
puter generated. In the words of
director Hopkins "This makes the
effects a character within the film,
rather than an added layer on top
of the action". Hmmm.
The plot is roughly based on
the the movies sixties namesake.
Professor John Robinson (Hurt) and
his family are selected to be the
first family to colonise outer space.
Just as they are beginning to settle
into work, their state-of-the-art
spacecraft (piloted by Friends star
LeBlanc) strays off course,
marooning the Robinsons and their
saboteur. Dr. Zachary Smith (a deli-
ciously hammy Gary Oldman).
Now, in the original Smith was
a slightly camp, decidedly non-
scary villain. Here, he's a creepy
evil mastermind. In the original, the
robot was a shambolic, laughable
object. Here it's a huge, imposing,
multi-million dollar creation. But
hell - who cares about comparisons
with the original. Lost in Space
promises huge effects and high
adventure - what more could you
possibly want?
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
Stars: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon,
Tom Sizemore
Director: Steven Spielberg
When: September 11
B
ring together the most suc-
cessful director in
Hollywood history, one of
the most popular A-list stars, and
this year's hottest new sensation.
Then roll them all into an intensely
patriotic war film, and what have
you got? Sure fire box-office gold,
that's what.
Tom Hanks stars as the leader
of a crack squad sent in to rescue
the eponymous Private Ryan (Good
Will Huntings Matt Damon), after
he is trapped behind enemy lines
during World War II. So why go to
such trouble to save one man in
the midst of such a devastating
conflict? Well, the US government
has discovered that three brothers
have all died in battle, and their
mother will receive three notifica-
tions on the same day. But then
they discover that there was a
fourth brother - a fourth member of
the Ryan family. The call goes out
to find him and bring him home....
Clearly, this is going to be more
of a tearjerker than a traditional
blood-and-guts war movie, but
with Spielberg's impeccable track
record in just about every genre
known to Hollywood, that's hardly
cause for concern.
Filmed in Hertfordshire (in a
disused British Aerospace hangar)
and on location on the beaches of
County Wexford, ireland, Saving
Private Ryan promises a gritty, real-
istic depiction of World War II, with
a huge budget allowing the D-Day
landings to be fully utilised as a
backdrop to the supposedly true
story. Hopefully this should all
finally add up to a big (and much
needed) success for Spielberg's
Dreamworks studio, breathing new
life into the war movie.
