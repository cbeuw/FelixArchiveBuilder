Every once in a while the

they die unnoticed and with-

PC HARDWARE REVIEW
SIDEWINDER FORCE FEEDBACK PRO
M i c r o s o f t £ 1 3 0 * *
ln this world there are joysticks and
then there are joysticks like this
one. At £130 pounds it is probably
the most expensive single stick
package available. Why so expen-
sive? Is it gold plated? Will it make
games easier to play? Well neither
but the hint is in the title. Where
the Nintendo and the Playstation
controllers vibrate away happily on
batteries when you get hit or shoot
at something, this caged tiger plugs
directly into the mains. The joystick
responds to pretty much everything
and this is shown in the demon-
stration games. One of these
games, Interstate '76 - the 'Mad
Max'-style car war driving game,
responds not only to what weapon
you are firing and what weapon is
firing upon you, but what road con-
ditions are and slope you are
driving on. It also reacts to the loss
of grip you experience if you corner precision shot through the side
too quickly. It does not make the window of your car is almost
game easier by any means, being impossible on anything but the
jolted as you attempt to make a smoothest of roads. What it does is
provide the same experience you
would expect from an arcade
game.
Don't worry that you might
have invested money on something
that will not work for anything else,
most of your favourite games have
at least some controls that can be
responded to. X-wing Vs Tie-
Fighter was brilliant as your fighter
bucks and reponds to the world
around you. But 1 suppose the big
£130 question, is it worth it? As a
toy yes, as a gamers tool no. For
the same money you can buy some
serious sound and graphics hard-
ware and a cheap £20-30 joystick
that will control the same games.
But I've already got a good enough
graphics and sound card. I think it's
a hoot, an expensive pointless hoot
- perhaps that's the point.
