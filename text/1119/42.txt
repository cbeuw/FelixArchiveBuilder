SAINTS AND
SINNERS
Marcelle Bernstein
Janie Paxton, journalist and recent-
ly divorced alcoholic, agrees to
write the authorised biography of
M a d g a Lachowska, the charasmat-
ic spiritual leader of the Chalice.
Although M a g d a Lachowska, oth-
erwise known as M a m a , is consid-
ered a living saint in whose foot-
steps lavander plants had been
seen to bloom, Janie takes the job
for other reasons. She sees the
opportunity of writing M a m a ' s
biography as a means of making
money and restoring her reputa-
tion to its former glory. A s Janie
investigates Mama's background,
discrepancies begin to emerge in
the offical version of Mama's his-
tory and Janie has to chose
whether to listen to her instincts
and uncover the real story or not.
Bernstein's strength is her abil-
ity to create believable characters
and then develop those characters
throughout the novel, using flash-
backs to keep the reader interest-
ed. O n the whole this is a very
g o o d book, the kind to take o n
holiday to read on the beach. If
that was the case I would happily
fork out the money for it but if not,
this is the kind of book I would
enjoy taking out of the library.

BITCH
BITCH
Elizabeth Wurtzel
A lot of people (men) will buy this
book simply for the picture of the
naked w o m a n on the front. They
will then read it, and discover that
Bitch does not refer to a stripper
with a penchant for d o i n g it
"doggy style", but to the state of
w o m e n today. Elizabeth Wurtzel
takes hundreds of examples of
w o m e n w h o have suffered and
presents them to us in this lucid
collection of essays on modern
w o m e n . She reminds us of the
pain felt by poets such as Sylvia
Plath and Annie Sexton, of the ter-
ror faced by N i c o l e B r o w n
Simpson, and celebrates some of
the most infamous w o m e n in his-
tory, d e f e n d i n g their outsize
desires, describing their exquisite
loneliness, championing their take-
no-prisoners approach to life and
to love.
Thanks to their past sufferings,
this is the first time in history that
a w o m a n can exist as a viable enti-
ty without the support of a man.
Hooray for feminism and d o w n
with the rotters, they're all bas-
tards. A g o o d book to read and
then talk about. At length. Loudly.
Not for the boys though.

IMAGININGS
OF SAND
Andre Brink
N'kosi sikelel' i-Afrika. The lead-up
to the birth of the N e w South
Africa was nothing if not traumatic.
Countless people, both black and
white, were killed in violent attacks
on humanity and property. The
tension mounted as many of the
old-style Afrikaners refused to
abandon their long held traditions.
The men in particular felt a great-
deal of resentment towards the
changes and towards the emerging
government. Despite the changes
being obvious to everyone in the
world, many denied that the black
Government would w i n . Back into
this claustrophobic society came
Kristien, to care for her dying
grandmother and to absorb her
memories of their family history.
Eleven years had passed since she
ran away to England to escape her
future, and she hadn't been back
since. The book charts her accep-
tance of her family and her history.
This book is amazing. The story
flows in an almost romantic way:
the stories of the velt fit beautifully
alongside the tensions of contem-
porary South Africa. Reading it
made me feel as if I was back in
the least tolerant and the most
beautiful country in the world. Buy
it, read it, love it. G o d bless Africa.

NAMEDROPPER
Emma Forrest
I've done the teen thing. It was fun
while it lasted, but was not an
experience I'd like to relive, so
reading this book about a self-pro-
claimed iconic sixteen year old was
not always a pleasant experience.
Viva Cohen has a blissful life
with her uncle, her lettuce-chewing
best friend, her favourite song and
her Elizabeth Taylor posters. After
the summer, she has a lot of
Elizabeth Taylor posters. Whenever
her life goes wrong, she turns to
her Marilyn M o n r o e or Audrey
Hepburn posters for comfort and
cries a l o n g to "The Boys of
Summer" by D o n Henley. She's
also a neurotic, paranoid, spoilt
brat, w h o prefers to be thought of
as an icon, rather than to d o any-
thing to merit it. She dreams of
how she'd commit suicide, has a
distaste for sex, (although she
never really gets any offers), trav-
els to America with her slightly
successful rockstar friend and gen-
erally daydreams her way through
life, until she's brought d o w n to
Earth with a bump.
The book is funny and quite
touching in parts, g o o d but not
great, and an enjoyable read whilst
bored.
