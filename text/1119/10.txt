THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
Mein Kampf

reshers, y o u are no longer.
Try to remember your first
day in hall; it probably
involved m u c h unpacking, a
m o m e n t spent deciding h o w many
posters it w o u l d take to cover the
walls, serious drinking, a half-
drunken mental estimation of the
male/female ratio, possibly vomit-
ing. Tonsil hockey, if y o u were par-
ticularly blessed. Then there was
the week y o u spent not going to
lectures while y o u met a load of
people from your hall, people y o u
haven't s p o k e n to since w e e k
three. Freshers' Fair, where y o u
signed up for eighty-five clubs,
joined one of t h e m , and then
decided that your time w o u l d be
better spent in Southside.
Remember lectures? They were the
boring things y o u attended for the
first term only. Believe it or not,
but some people have still got
them. Some of y o u will have dis-
covered drugs. Some of y o u will
have discovered sex. Some will
have embraced alcohol. A number
of y o u will have done all three.
Following a first term in which
you probably saw someone y o u
fancied cavorting with s o m e o n e
else (such a Hall p h e n o m e n o n that
someone in my first year thought
he might make a soap about it),
you probably spent most of the lat-
ter half of the second term missing
lectures. S o m e of y o u will be wor-
rying about having failed their
exams. S o m e will be panicking
about next year's a c c o m m o d a t i o n .
M o s t will be deciding their plans
for the summer. I a m convincing
myself that I w o n ' t be going to
Glastonbury again.
At this moment in time, the
average student's plans for the
s u m m e r s h o u l d be s o m e t h i n g
along these lines: pay overdraft;
catch up on all missed work from
past year; watch a small amount of
W o r l d C u p / Test m a t c h e s /
W i m b l e d o n (delete as appropri-
ate); sleep; eat; go to A m s t e r d a m ;
remember to keep in touch with all
the lovely new friends f r o m
College. By the end of the holiday,
all of these aims will have been
realised barring just two. I shall
leave the estimation of which two
as an exercise for the reader.
This year has also seen my rise
from a humble engineering student
to a revered wordsmith, capable of
twisting the English language into
such exquisite shapes that unsus-
pecting students have been known
to die outright o n Friday mornings,
upon experiencing the pure ecsta-
sy imparted by my writing. W h e n 1
strolled into the Felix office at the
beginning of the year, only barely
familiar with how it looked inside, I
certainly did not expect to leave it
with a regular c o l u m n . Luckily, I
was in the right place at the right
time w h e n the harassed editor,
placed under the Felix girder for
the duration of the year, was des-
perate for s o m e material to fill a
quarter-page. T w o weeks later,
when I ventured into the office
again, 1 was asked where my c o n -
tributions had been.
So began m y s e c o n d year,
regarded w i d e l y as being "the
worst year of your life". A t first the
novelty of b e c o m i n g a minor
celebrity, and having people that I
didn't even know recognise me,
was sufficient motivation to keep
churning out the literary bilge. By
the end of the first term I was get-
ting pretty hacked off with my
coursework, a n d even m o r e
hacked off writing five hundred
words per week. A few punters
pointed out that they could not
understand where I got my ideas
from. They had obviously not seen
me pacing a path into the floor for
three hours while attempting to
chain-smoke a workable theme
into my head. It was perhaps not
surprising, then, w h e n reported
ripples of poor quality, egomania-
cal drivel began to spoil the unbro-
ken surface of m y half-page's
moonlit lake. The less imaginative
of these include the Features
Editor's poetic description of one
composition which made rather
too heavy use of the w o r d "shit".
The most notable contributor
to these tidal waves of abuse was
a certain ex-girlfriend of mine.
Rather than greeting me with
s o m e t h i n g gratifying such as,
"Hello. I've missed y o u , " 1 got a
c o m m e n t stating that my material
was "nothing more than self-indul-
gent twaddle", before she went on
to steal my cigarettes and take up
valuable space on the sofa.
Having k n o w n virtually zero
about the workings of the Union
last year, during all that N e w
Election rubbish, I decided perhaps
that readers weren't that interest-
ed in the Union or College at all. I
thought I'd write about something
a bit different. M y aim was to turn
out something interesting; amus-
ing; occasionally bizarre; not
w r a p p e d up in politics and fairly
clean. What eight thousand read-
ers probably got was something
eccentric; peculiar; egocentric;
politics-free but still rather boring;
and fairly clean. Try thinking of thir-
ty different ideas that might be
amusing, and then think of four to
six hundred w o r d s ' worth of mate-
rial for each, and y o u will begin to
see the flaw in the plan.
Having said that, I reckon a few
valid points were made o n the
way. Will sheer processing power
conquer Shakespeare? Is an ego
desirable? Will Geri succeed o n her
own? A n d most importantly, w h o
is C o l u m b o ' s dealer? Despite
e p o c h - m a k i n g questions like
these, my only correspondence
over the entire year came from a
medical student w h o had postulat-
ed an intriguing scientific theorem
involving curry.
Felix, also, has seen s o m e
changes. Sub-editors have c o m e
and gone; enthusiastic m u s i c
reviewers have made the office
their o w n on a Friday afternoon; an
IC Radio page has mysteriously
appeared; a premature April Fool's
jape has fooled hundreds; the
newsteam have evaporated like
ideas for a column; and finally the
old Felix site has been sacrificed
for something far less interesting,
a i d e d by s o m e p r e - e m p t i v e
destruction by a homeless student
newspaper's staff.
So I carry my column's cross to
Golgotha, the Place of the Skull,
and see it crucified along with
"Digs the Dirt" and "Westminster
Eye", one o n either side. Not that I
claim these scribbles are in any
way God-like. O n the contrary,
TFTD will soon go to hell. A n d the
robbers? Everlasting life.
