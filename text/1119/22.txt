T
he stories and myths of the
labyrinth of tunnels under Imperial
College are something that almost
every student of the College is
familiar with. Underground rivers,
links with the Science Museum and
with a nuclear bomb shelter in Hyde Park are
common tales. There was even a rumour that by
following a certain passage northwards, one
would eventually reach two Guards with machine
guns. The most far-fetched tale of all came from
a member of the Rugby Club who later became
union President (and was therefore able to put
his considerable skills of rhetoric to good use).
He claimed that somewhere in the tunnels was a
very large fan. This fan ran permanently except
for one hour a day when it was switched off to
allow its bearings to cool- during this period it
was possible to step through the fan and access
a whole new series of tunnels.
It was with more interest than most that cer-
tain members of the adventurous clubs around
college listened to these tales. They made it
their aim to find out more, and over a period of
a few years, exploratory trips have been made
around the campus.
At first it was necessity which lead M'arse,
Jism and Goss who were living in ***** stores
to a familiarity of the tunnels north of Prince
Consort road. The need to get into the stores
when there was a function going on at the union
lead to the discovery of a tunnel leading under
Prince Consort Road, conveniently reached by
climbing through a window into the stores itself.
A desire to attend the Freshers' Ball without pay-
ing led Goss on an obscure route through the
Biology Department to the roof of Beit, around
the roof and down North East stairs into the Ball
walking past the back of the security guard.
Exploration of the course of the pipes lead to the
back of the S+G store room and a further set of
nasty crawling passages leading right around Beit
quad.
Wicky and Friends were more interested in
the climbing potential around college, and over a
series of excursions managed to climb the front
of the union as well as the front of the RSM
building. Working on a lab in the basement of
Mechanical Engineering, Jism and M'arse began
to explore this area - they found that it is possi-
ble to access the main tunnels very easily from
the inside of Mechanical Engineering during the
day, but even at night when the main door is
locked it is possible to get in via an obscure
squeeze past a pipe. The tale of the river was
cleared up when a large pipe spouting water into
an open tank was found. It did indeed sound like
a river from a distance. The source of this flow is
not known, but is unlikely to be caused by the
combined toilet flush of the building!
After a while the explorers started sharing
stories, and a few combined trips were under-
taken. The most convenient entrances to the
24 June 1998 FEATURE 25
system were found to be Mechanical
Engineering, Chemistry (this is now covered by
the medical building) and at the base of the
Queens tower. The tunnel under Exhibition Road
was found, which leads directly into the back of
Southside bar as well as to a shaft to the roof of
the halls. One excursion through chemistry hap-
pened to coincide with the burglar alarm at the
science museum going off and we were caught
by a snooping policeman as we were going in -
some fast talking being necessary!
During a Last Night of the Proms filming ses-
sion at the Royal Albert Hall, Jism Wicky and
M'arse managed to bullshit their way into the car
park under the RAH. While Jism diverted the
Guards attention Wicky and M'arse took a look
at a doorway at the back. It seemed to have that
familiar smell of disused tunnels and would be
worth further explorations.
But the most exciting lead of all was a 20
metre shaft leading into what looked like a grat-
ing and then the lights of a room in Queen's
Tower. Looking at this, we realised that it wasn't
possible to climb it, but with the help of a bolt-
ing kit and a few etriers (miniture flexible lad-
ders), it was possible to get to an intermediate
ledge about 4 metres up. The noise of the bolt-
ing hammer was clearly audible from the outside
of the tower, but as it wasn't clear where it was
coming from, no one seemed to care- no one
would have imagined what we were actually try-
ing to do.
From this point Wicky did a bit of
hairy acrobatics and managed to gain a
few more meters. Exploration went a
pace as we were able to put equip-
ment bought for the ****** expedition to good
use - a bolting platform and the Bosch drill! We
had a few scares during these bolting sessions,
but the only person who noticed our activities
was the old tramp who lives down in the tunnels.
We spoke a few words occasionally to him but
generally just said hello. After about two years of
occasional exploration trips we finally managed
to climb our way into the QT, rigging a perma-
nent Y-hang for future trips. The first person on
future trips would always use a second dynamic
rope and the intermediate bolts with extenders
so they could check the rope in safety. On a later
trip, Froggy took his full cave photography equip-
ment and took some excellent photos of the
shaft - before dropping his camera down it!
Assorted excursions continue, and a plan of
the tunnels is gradually taking shape (below).
There are many unknown leads still to investigate,
and the continuous building work destroys and
reveals new passages all the time. Not just
Imperial College, but also the Natural History
Museum, the Albert Hall, the Post Office, the
London Underground and the Ministry of Defence
all have tunnels on or next to the campus.
