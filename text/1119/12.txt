24 June 1998 COLUMNS 12
efore we get started, I'm
afraid it's necessary to men-
tion a few basic points of
bar etiquette. Firstly, what do you
do if you knock over another
chap's pint? Two possibilities- 'oh,
did that have beer in it,' said after
observing an enormous brown
puddle on the floor. This is not cor-
rect. The proper response is 'I'm
very sorry, let me get you another
one.' Secondly, the playing of
drums in Southside TV lounge
while members of the human race
are attempting to follow a World
Cup game is not recommended. I
shall say no more.
Start spreading the news, I'm
leaving today. Well, not exactly,
since I have been refused parole
again, but the dubious application
of Ol' Blue Eyes' lyrics have
become a bit of a tradition in this
column. Given that the great man
is now playing the biggest venue of
them all, I could not resist. For
many of you, this will be the last
Felix you read before you are cast
into the cultural wilderness that is
the real world. Some of you, now I
come to think of it, started at
broadly the same time as this col-
umn, affording you a glimpse of
Imperial College life denied to your
predecessors. Ah well, can't win
'em all.
This year has been fairly event-
ful for Imperial, containing low
points and lower points. Ooh, such
cynicism is one so young. Only jok-
ing. This year has been marked by
a few big successes, none more so
than the second position of IC in
the Financial Times University sur-
vey, and first position of Southside
Bar in the inter-bar boat race. If
one wishes to demonstrate the
changes that have occurred at
Imperial, one need look no further
than the BMS. Regular readers will
know that I have been scathing
about this project in its early
stages, but as time has gone on, it
has come together very success-
fully. Not perfectly, however, as
the Rector has said in this issue,
but 1 must say that compared to
most building projects at IC, this
one has gone like clockwork. The
building itself, which I visited last
week (thanks again to Phil Hilton
and Ollie Clarke of Schal), is quite
superb and utterly wasted on
medics, who, as new members of
the College, would be far better
served by occupying a building
steeped in the glorious history of
Imperial, such as the neighbouring
Chemistry department. As for the
biologists, so used to cramped,
decaying facilities, they will more
likely than not be forced to wear
slippers for fear of dirtying the
carpet.
So often these large projects
suffer from continual compromise
that eats away at the intended
improvement of facilities, but in
this case attention to detail is
clear. Though I have obviously not
seen the facilities intended for
Snow White, her seven dwarves
will be delighted with their toilets,
particularly the loo roll dispensers
that are six inches off the deck.
Stranger still is the uncanny resem-
blance to the Southside toilets. If
Sir Norman Foster popped in for a
jar, the least he could have done
was stand a round or two.
hence the recent second election
for DP F&S (bloody acronyms-
they've got me doing it as well)
caused by perceived academic
weakness. This is happening far
too often, though I see little solu-
tion beyond seeking academic ref-
erences for candidates. However, I
shudder to think what this could
lead to. A far bigger problem is the
constituency from which most
candidates emanate, namely the
Union itself. This year has been a
little different, and it is good to get
people with a fresh approach,
unburdened by years of hackery,
though this is not to say that some
of ICU's golden children have gone
on to make great sabbaticals. At
this rate, I should be able to get the
backs up of everyone by the end of
the article...

The Union has proved, as ever,
to be a fairly eventful place. The
carnivals have been very good, the
beer has been very bad (stick to
the Guinness, which is not bad at
all) and the elections have been
held at a rate that would give an
Italian returning officer work-relat-
ed stress. When we finally elected
Andy Heeps, we got a very safe
pair of hands to continue the
excellent work of Eric Allsop.
Sherfield were delighted when a
medic won, since it made the
merger that little bit easier, but
many of us, myself included, were
a bit wary. Fortunately we have
been proved wrong. Andy has not
displayed the small mindedness
and chidlish insularity that charac-
terises so many of his medical col-
leagues and is perfectly illustrated
in the block votes. Hopefully the
presence of a medic at the high
altar will also help to bring the new
BMS intake into the fold next term.
While we have certainly had fewer
elections than last year, the
process has gone without a hitch.
... which brings me neatly to
Sherfield. I sometimes worry that
this obsessive interest is unique to
me, yet it is the topic that those
people who still talk to me men-
tion the most. From the point of
view of a humble wordsmith, that
building is a godsend. Have you
any idea how hard it would be to
craft 500 words of purple prose
(no sniggering at the back) every
week without that lot? They're not
all bad, of course, but some of
them do give the impression of
pausing mid sentence purely to
change foot in mouth. All this leads
some to say I am out to rubbish
Imperial at every opportunity. Not
so. If I truly did not give a toss
about IC, I wouldn't be here in the
first place. Though parts of IC are
run well, many areas are managed
in a way that is detrimental to the
students, the staff and the College
itself. Quite why we tolerate such
practices in non-academic depart-
ments in an elitist institution has
always been a mystery. The prob-
lem with many of the denizens of
Sherfield is that while they are
they are not stupid. Making mud
stick on a department made of
Teflon is not easy, and even Felix
occasionally gets it a little wrong.
The Conference Office springs to
mind, but I can say no more
because on one hand my solicitor
is on holiday and also I have
booked a room in Evelyn Gardens
this summer. Therefore I better say
how marvellous the staff are in that
department. They know where I
live.
Outside College, it has been a
funny old year. There is too much
change. Ginger Spice has left. Barry
Norman has sold out to Sky, and
the House of Lords is the subject
of a bizarre and deeply unwise
reform. New Labour plods on,
becoming more sanctimonious
and less like the dream that so
many endorsed. Against this back-
drop, strong opposition is essen-
tial. The Conservatives, after an
understandably shaky start after 18
years on the other side of the
House, are now taking Labour to
task in an effective manner.
Cometh the hour, cometh the
man. Though she has only been in
the job a week or so, Ann
Widdecombe is already proving
her self to be a mjor thorn in the
side of the Cabinet. This woman
scares Michael Howard, so what
chance does Blair have. 1 quite
expected that Tony Blair would
have the decency to announce the
Cabinet reshuffle before this article
so I could rubbish it, but that's
politicians for you.
So much to say and so little
space. No time to review the art
'exhibitions', not even time to
remind those of you who forgot to
get out of bed this year to sample
the exquisite beer in Southside
That's pretty much the long and
the short of it. I've enjoyed this
year, and I hope that I have pro-
vided something to amuse and
infuriate you. Going by the Felix
postbag, I suspect the latter, but
you know what Oscar Wilde said
on being talked about. Farewell,
mes amis, be you staff, student or
even Director of Estates. As for
next year, who knows? All I do
know is that next year's editor is a
Titan among men, blessed with
exceptional judgment and savoir-
faire. Another beer, Ed?
Ladies and Gentlemen, Simon
Baker has been put back in his box
- Ed.
