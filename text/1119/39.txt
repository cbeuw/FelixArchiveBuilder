THE BIG SUMMER PREVIEW
THE AVENGERS
Stars: Ralph Fiennes, Lima
Thurman, Sean Connery
Director: Jeremiah Chechik
When: August
I
n a summer of cult TV reincar-
nations, The Avengers promises
to be the only one true to its
roots. The trailers and pre-publicity
promise the original blend of kitsch
fashions, kung-fu and utterly
implausible plot-lines, all delivered
in a thoroughly Victorian style -
stiff-upper lips are definitely the
order of the day.
Ralph Fiennes and U m a
Thurman star as aristocratic crime
fighters John Steed and E m m a Peel
(the roles originally made famous
by Patrick M c N e e and Diana Rigg),
complete with lethal umbrella and
leather catsuit respectively. They
must save the world from the dia-
bolical Sir August de Wynter,
played by Sean Connery w h o clear-
ly relishes the chance to ham-it-up
magnificently as a kilted madman.
De Wynter has stolen T h e
Prospero Project', a device with
which he can control the world's
Stars: David Duchovny, Gillian
Anderson
Director: Rob B o w m a n
W h e n : August 21
W
ith the plot a tightly
g u a r d e d secret - the
script has been printed
on red paper so that it can't be
photocopied and the set is con-
stantly surrounded by rabid securi-
ty guards - it's very difficult to rate
the first big-screen outing for
Mulder and Scully.
However, rumour suggests that
the plot will be pitched as both a
stand alone episode and an end to
series five (currently airing on satel-
lite). Likely plot lines include
Mulder's sister, his parents, little
green m e n and, of course, govern-
ment conspiracy. Basically, it looks
like it's designed as a extended
episode of the hit series, with an
effects budget only slightly above
usual (the entire movie has a bud-
get of Â£30 million - economic by
Hollywood standards).
Series regular Rob B o w m a n is
in the directors chair, so the usual
weather , and consequently threat-
ens to hold the world to ransom.
Steed and Peel are the only force
capable of stopping him, and to d o
so they must face various other
foes including: knife-wielding nan-
nies, 6-foot teddy bear-suited nin-
jas, and a robotic double of Peel
who is determined to destroy the
agents. M o v e over James Bond....
Probably the most stylish and
individual of the s u m m e r ' s big
releases, this has the potential to
either become a mass phenome-
non, or die in shame. Fortunately,
the makers have for once accepted
that the kitsch styles and overt
Englishness were what made the
original great, and based the film
around them.
A
ugust will undoubtedly be
d o m i n a t e d by
Avengers, with x Files: The
M o v i e in a s u p p o r t i n g role.
However, with the football over
there are loads of other releases
waiting in the wings, including ....
Bruce Willis starrer Mercury Rising.
The Die Hard-ster is a lone FBI
agent, trying to protect an autistic
kid w h o manages to hack into the
Pentagon's most secretive code.
It's all loosely based o n Ryne
Pearson's novel Simple Simon, and
co-stars Alec Baldwin as the evil
government agent on their trail ....
Land Girls is this summers big Brit
C o m offering. Anna Friel (late of
Brookside) stars as one of a trio of
w o m e n w h o take o n farm labour
when the m e n go away to fight
World War II. O f course, they all
fall for the rugged farm lads, and
much female bonding ensues ....
The Gingerbread M a n is the latest
from the John Grisham stable, with
Kenneth Brannagh in the lawyer-in-
peril-role. H o w e v e r , this one
promises to be a cut above the
usual fare, with Robert Altman in
the director's chair, and a bizzare
plot centring around Embeth
Davidtz attempts to consign her
dad to the loony bin .... None too
subtle political satire c o m e s in the
form of Primary Colours, with John
Travolta as the pants-down Pres
and E m m a Thompson as his put-
upon first lady .... Eddie murphy
stars as The Holy M a n , advocating
the pursuit of life, laughter and
love .... Robert Redford is on sickly
sweet form as a cowboy type w h o
who breaks-in wild horses by whis-
pering to t h e m in The H o r s e
Whisperer- Kristin Scott-Thomas is
the city-girl w h o enlists his help
when her daughter is injured in a
riding accident, it's adapted from a
best selling novel, so big things are
expected .... A n d on the subject of
pregnancy, Madeleine Stowe and
William hurt dabble disastrously
with surrogacy in The Proposition
.... The Object of M y Affection has
already kicked up a fuss in the
States, with it's depiction of a
pregnant w o m a n lusting after her
gay flatmate. Friends star Jennifer
Aniston takes the lead, with a per-
formance best described as " A
w o m a n with a cushion stuck up her
jumper".
X-FILES : THE MOVIE
tense feel and fast pace can be
expected, and of course David
Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are
on hand to dish out the usual win-
ning brand of unshakeable belief
and scepticism, topped off with
that all important sexual tension.
Indeed, there have even been
rumours sneaking off the set of a
romantic liaison between the stars.
In the words of series creator
(and co-writer) Chris Carter " W e
thought we had to make it bigger,
but we really didn't want to make
this a $100 million movie. We're
striving to d o what we've done so
well on the series, which is to scare
you by only showing little bits".
Which all suggests the usual
healthy mix of action, aliens and
extroadinarily convoluted plot that
we've all c o m e to know and love.
And whatever happens, however,
the massive cult following behind
the series virtually guarantees g o o d
box office returns.
