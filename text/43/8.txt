I.C DOES WELL IN UL CUPS
Rugger—
A RUNAWAY VICTORY.
U.L. RUGBi CUP. Second Round.
I.C.- 28 Northern Polytechnic—3.
ThiB game was played on a treacherous wet surface
with a north wind blowing sleet and rain the length of
the ground. Starting against the wind I.C. looked a faster
and better side than their opponents and were first to score
through an Unconverted try by Coppelman. Northern Poly,
replied with a try, but just before half-time Hearn touched
down a kick ahead to regain the lead. In the second half
the college quite overwhelmed the visitors; making full use
of the conditions by incessant long kicks downfield. There
was some good play by the back, although attempts at handl-
ing were a waste of time. On several occasions a tackled
three-qutirter was able to release the ball and get a foot to
i t to start a rush. Six more tries were scored; one of the
best coming when Groves, who had followed up a diagonal kick
by Hykin, was able to. gather a fortunate bounce at full speed
The scorers were Groves (3), Crossley (2), Cbppelman, Hearn
and Hykin. Robinson made two conversions inspite of the
mud.
I.C. are clearly capable of retaining the University
Cup i f they play intellegently, and choose the correct
tactics in succeeding rounds. The keen support for the
four lower XV's ensures a number of good reserves on the
fringe of the first team as an insurance against injuries.
The semi-finals are not until Feb. 18th when I.C. play
Wye College, and Q.M.C. (last year's runners-up) play
Kings, who have half-a-dozen University players.

2nd. ROUND U.L. CUP
I.C. versus St. Mary's. Won by I.C.
The U.L. Squash Cup ia contested with only three
players; this se cond round looked like a really hard
fight, with St. Mary's playing the U.L. captain as their
first string, and with I.C. playing three Varsity men,
J.Kenyon, A.A.Williams, and M.D.Martin.
The third pair went into the court first, and proved
to be the most interesting squash, from the gallery point
of view. The first two games brought out some excellent
squash, but Mike Martin then found a good length on his
corner drives, and alternating with side-mil drop shots,
soon had his opponent very exhausted; he eventually won,
s t i l l appearing very nrach fresher than the St.Mary's No.3.
by 3 games to 1.
A.A.Williams did not get much opportunity to use his
'disguised wrist-shots' ; his opponent was somewhat of a
slogger, with the result that the game did not prove very
interesting to watch, a great pity because Tony Williams'
subtle play is usually very impressive. He won by 3 games
to 1, without appearing at a l l pressed.
John Garfield, the U.L. captain, was in excellent form
and proved too much for Jeff Kenyon, who lost in three
straight games. Garfield's corner drives were irretrieva-
ble, and his side-court drives soareely left the side-
walls at a l l . This match was again disappointing, for had
Jeff Kenyon been 'on-form' we would have seen some first-
class squash.

A GOOD D/SPLAY
U.L. Cup. Second Round.
Kings 1 I.C. 6
I.C. fought their way into the semi-final of the
U.L.Hockey Cup competition by a convincing victory over
King's College on Wednesday,26th.Novemberof six goals
to one.The match was played almost throughout in a cold
driving drizzle but the standard of hockey was surpris-
ingly good.
The first ten minutes were critical for I.e.,but
the defence stood up to the test well,and from then on
the half-back line gradually gained control of the game.
Consequently,in the second half the I.C.forwards were
kept well supplied with passes and proved too much for
the King's defence.The first four goals were scored by
Latter,Power,and John Smith(2),and the fifth was the
result of a demonstration by Forster of how a penalty
corner should be taken.King's struck back and scored
but I.Chad the last word when Haye3 went through and
scored from the edge of the circle.
The semi-final will be played on February 4th.
when we shall probably meet our old foes,University
College,who at present have the Cup in their possession.
W
e are looking forward to relieving them of this
responsibility.

MID SEASON COMMENTS
The recent form of the first XI indicates that i f the
forwards can produce a l i t t l e extra punch (metaphorically
speaking) in front of goal and the defence indulge in
strong first time tackling, the team should give a good
account of itself in the second half of the season. Unf
fortunately the same cannot be said of the second XI
which is having a very lean season. There appears to be
despondency in the team and until this is. got rid of
the games will continue to be lost. A contributory factor
to this apathetic condition is probably the difficulties
experienced by the club officials in selecting teams.
An availability l i s t is in operation and correct use of
this should ensure that there are no crossings off but
recently last minute withdrawals have had disastrous ef-
fects as a quick glance at the record shows.
