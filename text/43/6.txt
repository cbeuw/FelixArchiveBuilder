On the whole, the items were w e l l performed
and w e l l received. However, Dr. Jacques' hero,

Dear Sir,
Mr, Fisher thinks that a page in FELIX devoted to
U.L. activities should have the precedence to the sports
page if lack of space prevents the inclusion of both
tea f a r e s .
Mr Fisher rightly assesses the world situation as
grave. The remedy he xuggests, namely 'a resurgence
of critical and constructive thought in mankind" is a
well sounding phrase with vacuum behind it.
We have a lot of crntJval and constructive thought
going on. What is lacking in the world to-day is
to 1eranee and good will.
To promote tolerance and good will we have to be
primarily interested in people and their problems. We
can practice that splendidly at I.C,,
To take part in the activities of U.L. means a lot
of time, '.i'hose who fully participate in the life of
I.C often cannot afford it. It does not mean that
they do not work towards the objectives Mr. Fisher is
rather vaguely worrying about.
He also suggest that to practice sport is to be
directly preventing understanding in the world.
Something is seriously wrong with someone's reasoning
here!
To practice any form of sport the way we see it is
llo develop those very qualities which if present all
over the world, would make for better understanding
among nations.
At sport we train to achieve our objects by fair
means, with courage and zeal. We learn team work and
inward discipline. We learn to know one another. We
have, no language barriers. That i s very important.
activities.''I am merely saying that they will never be
generally topical at I.C. , We will not lose atmthingby
that. Nor will the world at large .'lose anything and
with it the cause Mr. Fisher is fifyh'tlng for.
Your faithfully,
J, PRZEWLOCKI, 2M

Sir ,
As your intendant book reviewer I must most vigorously
place myself detached from the spelling and punctuation
in the Union Library assays of the last three fCbiX" a.
Would your correspondent please justify. Can he justify
it? Is he sha^,? Yours etc.,

Dear Sir,
As, I hope, 'FELIX' is an impartial animal
and the views of his staff are not unduly forced
on the College; I do deprecate the waging of a
private c r u s a d e , on the matter of punctuation,
within its pages, , Even more so is tih^i a matter
of concern, when one considers the fact, ttmt the
author of this campaign is one, who is urging us •
via I.C, Library • to a better knowledge of the
finer points of the language, whose English is' in-
complete without full punctuation, and whose writ-
ing is often n rtdered thereby ambigous or even
unintelligible.
