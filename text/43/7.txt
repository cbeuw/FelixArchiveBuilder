FELIX
If yon find a spare toe xx^xng about the
Union Library, the odds are that "Evelyn "faugh has
shot i t off one of his characters; which seems a
good footing to start a dissertation on book's to
take out for the holiday.
Cronin made a shattering impression on me when
I read "The Citadel". I f you want a powerful book,
unpleasant yet fascinating and conscience stirring,
thats the one I recommend. Almost eaually stirring
i s Arthur Koestlers "Darkness atw
oon", an account
of the Moscow t r i a l s , containing an unforgettable
picture of pitiless electric lamps and the inhuman
method of theoretical fetishists. On a more human
level, Alan Patons "Cry, The Beloved Country" i s
a parable : the writing attains a poetic beauty
foreign to this century as the problems of Africa
are s k i l f u l l y , sympathetically, laid hare.
Somerset Maugham i s a safe bet, though he
rambles a b i t , and, thank heaven, occasionally
steps outside the grammar books. "The Razors'
Edge" w i l l hold you when the fires gone out. So
will Beerbohm's only novel Znloika pobson",
which outlandishly outWaughs Waugh, and which
must be the only book containing a proposal last-
ing several pages. Also, though I havent had a
chance to read i t , glorious things are spoken of
Monseratt's "The Cruel Sea".
But, i f you want i t straight from the jaw,
try Shaw's "Quintessence of Tbsenism", part of
his Major C r i t i c a l Essays, or else, "The Story of
my Life", the autobiography of Helen Keller, a
deaf and blind American heroine.
Hemingway, who makes lawyers cay peculiar
things, and Linklater, who can be shocking at
times, appeal to many people. Books by the latter,,
togethet with Cronin and Scotland are the most
sought-after works i n the library at the moment
(there are now 150 members). Tolstoy i s also
popular, and i f everybody read "War and Peace"
there would be no more war - there wouldnt be time
for i t .
This- series of articles has now rambled into
i t s last paragraph. Though Tra far from finished,
youve no doubt had enough, and everything has to
stop some time, as John C-ilpin-may have said. I t
only remains for me to thank jfchose. °- you who have
read this far, to remind you-.that everybody can
take out, and has time to read, a book over the
Christmas holiday, to express gratitude to my
friend G. Bonham-Thomas for help and critiscm, to
acknowledge spelling inspiration from the late G.
B. Shaw and considerable assistance from the
Library Committee, headed by John Midgley and the
Union Librarian, Dr.Hiilsi, and to sign off.
