Reagan visits IC?
The Spitting Image puppet of Ronald
Reagan occupied the foyer of the Union
Building last Saturday for the 'To Boldly
Go' conference against censorship. The
conference was opened by Barbara
Ehrenreich pictured on the cover with
her agent, Briar Silich and Ronnie.
Barbara is an award-winning american
journalist and author of 'The Worst Years
of our Lives', a critical commentry on the
Reagan years.
Also attending the conference were
nineteen other speakers including
novelists, poets, filmmakers and a
solicitor specialising in freedom of artistic
expression. The guests spoke on the
various aspects of censorship from the
nationwide use of secrecy as a
government policy to the self-censorship
which we experience in day to day life.
The manager of the 'Young Unknowns'
gallery near Waterloo, Peter Sylveira,
spoke of a piece of art containing two
freeze-dried foetuses obtained from St
Mary's Hospital Medical School. He was
successfully prosecuted for outraging
public decency and was fined £850 and
now has a criminal record. He
condemned the establishment and art
community for their failure to support
him and the principle of freedom of
expression.
Peter Sylveira: Criminal?
Nicholas Walter, Director of the
Rationalist Press Association, talked of the
censorship which we impose and which is
imposed on us from childhood onwards.
Two banned films, 'Dick' and 'Visions of
Ecstasy', were shown at the event. 'Dick'
is a comic film showing the naked truth
of man's inadequacy ie one thousand
flaccid penis's with a commentary
produced soley by women. It has been
banned from public broadcasting by the
ITC. The second film, 'Visions of Ecstasy'
has been banned under the blasphemy
laws and cannot legally be bought, sold
or broadcast. Michael Newman,
conference organiser, commented that the
showing of the film might have been
'slightly illegal'. A second event is being
planned for next year.
The Late Dr L Beverly Halstead, who
spoke at the conference, was tragically
killed this week in a car accident. He will
be remembered for his sense of fun and
caring.
