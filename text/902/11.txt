Scribblers' Corner
College Day, Will The Rector
Ever Listen to Reason?
Felix,
I have just sat through a Board of
Studies (BoS) meeting at which the
Working Party on the College Day
submitted a report. The report seems
very well-balanced and appears to put
forward admirably the pros and cons of
the day length extension. Professor
Swanson has done the job he was asked
to do and did it well. I sat there and
watched the Chairmen of BoS (The
Rector Sir Eric Ash) in action, this
proposal is his baby as you can tell. He is
definitely looking at the matter through
rose-coloured glasses; he will not hear
anything detrimental about his ideas. He
seems determined to bulldozer this
through as soon as possible. He does not
seem to appreciate the implications such
a proposal will make to the working of
IC, even though it has been written down
in black and white by Professor Swanson.
The students need to be shown the for
and against, have the implications
explained (ie no extra lecture time, just
mere prospective slots for the lecturers to
sit in) but also technician and lecturer
trade unions must be consulted as far as
contracts and hours of working are
involved.
The Rector wanted this to start as from
October ie next term but this will not
happen as all the above have to be
consulted and their positions taken into
account. At the present Professor
Swanson has to be told to tout for
responses from those already mentioned
and to report back to the June BoS with,
if all concerned agree and the Rector's
badgering pays off, any proposals started
Spring-term '92. In the meantime
hopefully ICU will undertake a
referendum of opinions, (once all students
are clued up) to aid Professor Swanson.
This must be done in a fool-proof manner
so that it is not disregarded as biased
rubbish. Therefore standby for another
questionnaire or the like and make sure
you know the facts and how they may or
may not affect you. Listen to the
arguments from both sides with equal
attention, weigh them up, and make your
opinion known. After all it will affect
everyone.
