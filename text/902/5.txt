Predator 2
IThe man who made this film is the
same creative powerhouse
responsible for Tina Turner videos
and Coke adverts. This is extraordinary
since this film bears absolutely no traces
of this heritage, perhaps due to the work
of the cinematographer and editor. For
example, at no point does the Predator
announce that it is the future of the
world, although now and again it does
flash its fishnet clad legs at the camera.
Danny Glover covers for Arnie (now
that the big man has gone on to
producing cute kiddy films) with a screen
performance almost, but not quite, the
same as his role in Lethal Weapon. The
main difference being that he has no
moustache. Also he is harder than a bull
with BSE and romps impressively from
one pitched battle to another. Said battles
are initially between various warring drug
barons (again) until a third party (oddly
enough, not Cap'n Birdseye) begins to
steadily fraction any faction who happens
to be around, and draws the wrath of
Glover upon its scaly head. This doesn't
worry it too much since it is played by
Kevin Peter Hall who is seven feet two
inches tall and it has four jaws to boot
(not mentioning an arsenal of hi-tech doo-
dahs that could perform a certain Jewish
operation on a gnat at 200 yards). Given
this enviable mandibular largesse it's not
surprising that he quickly racks up a
body count most easily measured in
Standard Index Form, and since he's
already picked Danny for his prize his
unfortunate ornaments are mostly
composed of hoods and the odd hapless
policeman.
Inevitably enough a third group has to
enter the scene, the Well-Meaning But
Misguided team of Feds. Having served to
establish a link with the first movie they
proceed to wander in and out of the
script now and again, holding Danny
back as only the FBI can.
That's about all there is to the plot save
for a comprehensive A to Z of stereotype
ethnic bad guys. However, what seems
like a never-ending series of cliches in
print is in fact fairly lucid and smooth on
screen; the interest in this film lies in the
self-consistency it presents and more
importantly in the stunning visuals.
Special effects are not too far to the fore,
taking second place to pace and slick
editing (particularly in a brilliant subway
sequence shot entirely in strobing light).
More action than its predecessor but a
little less suspense; a good film even if
the Predator's spaceship does look like a
set from a high budget episode of Doctor
Who (fluorescent painted walls); and
there's more than a hint of a possible
Predator 3.
The Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine
Highlander II
Highlander II , The Quickening
Quicker than what ? A monoped
tortoise on Mogadon ? This sad
little sequel has more holes than a Swiss
cheese caught in Robo-Cop III. Connor
McCloud (Christopher Lambert) is back
after having won 'the prize' (Brucey
Bonus) giving him the power to guide
mankind and be mortal. His guidance
leads to the erection of an amazing laser
shield to replace the ozone layer (honest).
Great idea at the time (1999); twenty-five
years later it's a real bummer as it keeps
in the smog and allows no rain . Now
Connor is effectively 75 years old and
suddenly remembers that he and all the
other eternals were from the purple
planet Zeist and were exiled by the
wicked dictator for trying to rebel. Added
to this is a magic bond between Ramirez
(Sean Connery) and McCloud which is a
bit like Jiminy Cricket's 'Give a little
whistle' if you need a friend . I guess
they just forgot to tell us this in the first
one .
Having left the Highlander in exile for
over 500 years and now on the verge of
death by old age the evil General Katana
(Michael Ironside) decides this is a prime
opportunity to send two flying porcupine
men to assassinate him. This leads to
rejuvenation, ecological commando raids
and an overall plot that Hanna Barbera
would think twice about.
On the plus side the special effects are
stunning and the sets (at times) are
breathtaking. Some scenes are very good,
especially a slow motion piece where the
big two Rebels without a Zeist are
machine gunned, although other parts ,
the majority could easily turn up in the
A-Team .
This film sits happily on the wrong side
of average . No Queen sound track ,
awful plot , terrible accents and it doesn't
fit in with the first film . Sean's good
though.
