London Students Travel
Or at least about 20,000 of them do, out of about 0.25m, using London
Student Travel, the student-owned travel company.
For weeks now I have been awaiting their Report and Accounts but,
since they didn't have their own accountant until very recently, the
auditors, (Spicer and Pegler would you believe!) have had quite a bit of
work to do.
So, to fill In the time I shall leak highly boring information because I
have little else to do.
Sales of the company last year amounted to around £560,000.
Revenue to the company was 11% or about £60,000. Profits estimates
are put at between £5,000 and £8,000.
The authorised capital of the Company is £24,000 (are you getting
bored?) of which £10,000 is issued, £5,000 being held by Exchange
Travel and £1,000 by Imperial College Union.
Economics is a closed book to many, especially when they think in
terms of the £40 a week that comes from their grant cheque. £560,000 (it
is slightly more comprehensible to me than £0.56m) is one heck of a lot
of money, until y o u start looking at, say BP'S profits (£444.4m) or
Unilever's first quarter sales (£2,585m). O n e week's reading the
Financial Times is enough to make anybody wonder where all the
money gets to. The problem is that money keeps going round and round
in circles and turnover figures signpost part of the direction in which it
was travelling.
Having said that, profits are the part of the turnover which, at any
particular time, belongs to the company which is creating that turnover.
Though I do not wish to indulge in a full-blooded capitalist apologia I
will point out that profits rarely 'belong' for long but get passed on to
shareholders (who spend it) or spent by the company inorderthatitwill
make a profit the next year. (Note, if you want to speed the revolution the
best way is to do the supremely capitalist thing, ie light your cigarettes,
gas rings or other fires with £20 notes!)
To make profits it is required to employ capital. It is very unusual for a
company to be required to pay cash for any goods or services it requires
but it will not get those things unless the supplierthinks it will get paid.
The supplier must see that Capital exists to pay the bill sometime or it
will not supply. However, the rate of return on capital is important, it is
undesirable for this return to be low.
Which brings me to another boring figure, Return on Capital
Employed, 50-80%. This is a truly amazing figure and can only be
achieved because the Company is small. However as with ail young
companies L S T is under-capitalized.
Of the £14,000 of unused capital Exchange Travel has first option on
£7,000. This is a travel company owned by a highly respected but mildly
eccentric travel salesman called George McNally who, on one occasion,
marched up and down on the British side of the bridge connecting
Gibraltor and Spain carrying a Union Flag in a rather unsubtle attempt
to get the Spanish authorities to allow travel across it.
In a singularly uncharacteristic action, for which we are eternally
grateful, he agreed to match, pound for pound, any capital put up by
student Unions for L S T up to a total of £24,000 (ie he would commit
£12,000). Let there be no doubt about it, this is a good thing, it makes
any capital that we contribute much more effective. However L S T needs
more.
The capital is used to provide bonds, that is sums of money made over
to our suppliers as a guarantee that we will pay them for any services
they supply us. (I have started identifying with L S T so us, our and we
means the Company in various senses, however, to confuse you, it
might mean I C U occasionally). The C o m p a n y deals in selling journey
tickets for air, rail and ferry trips, both to students in London and to
other Student Travel Bureaux, as well as some inclusive or package
holidays. It has considerable scope forexpansion in every field in which
it operates, a fact which is recognised by other companies who have
approached L S T with an aim to providing capital. These have been
turned down.
Of course, most shareholders look for a return or dividend on their
investment. Again, I do not wish to indulge in a diatribe on the subject of
the value of our shareholding in a C o m p a n y which provides a service to
our (ICU's) members which they like to have, which is reliable and
which may be more convenient supplied in that way. It is a charge that is
levelled against L S T quite often that their products are not particularly
cheap. We (LST) attempt to sell products (air flights, holidays) that give
value-for-money, where, barring air-traffic controllers'strikes, if a ticket
is bought a seat will be reserved and the flight will occur. L S T is not a
bucket shop. Cheaper products might be possible if turnover increases
and profits rise. Anyway, L S T has no intention at the moment to declare
a dividend.
The return on £10,000 invested in a Building Society would be about
£800 (in B P it would be about £350). Therefore it is possible to argue that
since this is between about 16% and 10% of estimated profits it is not
excessive. It means our dividend cover would be between 6 and 10
(Total profits/Total dividends) which is highly respectable (as indeed is
a yield of 8%). However the capital needs of our company is such that
our profits may well be much better employed as retained earnings.
There is an argument that some kind of definite return will encourage
many of the student unions who have not invested in L S T to do so. But
student unions care little about good investment strategies as shown
by, (a) the fact that shares in L S T are being offered on a ridiculously low
P/E (Price of share / Earnings per share - between 2 and 1.25) (b)
Student Unions, as charities, invest in Building Societies anyway.
A rapid scan through the Financial Times will show there are few
companies whose shares can be obtained on such a low P/E and as
charities student unions can get gross returns on their investments
while Building Society interest is paid net.
A n alternative to giving a dividend is to give a scrip issue. At say, 1 for
10 this would mean that I C U had £1100 invested in LST, (instead of
£1000) an apparent return of 10%, while the actual money is retained as
Capital by the Company. However, this would increase Exchange
Travel's, holding by £500 without them actually putting up any cash so it
would deprive L S T of £500 of their money, perhaps an agreement
could be reached to modify this unsatisfactory effect.
In the meantime, contribute to LST's profitability by booking your
holiday through the Campus Office.
