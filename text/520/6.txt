At times, she felt as if she was peering over the edge of some yawning abyss. T h e n a
voice inside her would whisper beseechingly... 'Look away, lest you fall.' A n d she would
glance away, only lo behold an eternity of desert, arid and desolate.
At thirty-live, her gaunt features already betrayed the anxieties and dissipations of
her immoderate vouth. H o w could she have been so irresponsible! Her children
needed her. their mother. In whose arms were they now? Some Circe with whom her
ex-husband had become momentarily enfatuated? What demon had possessed her to
concede sole custody to him? Her m i n d recoiled from the Rhadamantine reasoning of
her conscience. N o longer could her amour-passion for Peter viel the mortification she
now felt at deserting her children, her destiny.
H o w far back these rabid thoughts had led her by the hand. A l l the while she had
lain motionlessly in bed, nervously fingering a string of worry-beads. Following some
caprice, she dressed hurriedly. W i t h i n a minute, the door slammed noisily behind her.
T o avoid the milling crowds, she left the hotel by the back entrance. Then, with
downcast eyes, she made her way towards a quaint taverna she knew on the outskirts of
the village. In her self-preoccupation, she barely noticed a near-fatal collision between
a pedestrian and a car which had occurred almost right before her eyes.
Just then, she stopped. A child, a small
Greek girl, with dishevelled auburn hair,
plaintive eyes, and a grubby, bronzed face,
barred her way. T h e child communicated
her needs by a series of gestures - Sue thought
perhaps that she was d u m b . She rubbed her
stomach, pointed to her open mouth, then
earnestly stretched forth her hand. As Sue
delved into her bag, the girl repeated the
series of gestures a g a i n a n d a g a i n .
Unfortunately, Sue had left her room in such
haste that she had forgotten to pick up her
purse. She felt chagrined : she dearly wanted
to give the child something, especially as she
resembled her own Augustine. In the midst ol
her quandary, Sue espied a gorgeous red
flower blooming miraculously amidst the
refuse in the gutter. Arousing the keen
curiosity of her friendly assailant, she stooped
awkwardly to pluck it.
As she presented the child with the flower,
accompainied by a broad, almost pitiful
smile, the girl's cherubine features become
flushed with anger.
Snapping the stork ofthe flower in two, the
ungrateful girl threw it away in disgust, then
ran off to j o i n her friends who had watched
the incident from near-by.
This trivial encounter touched the gentle
lady's heart to the quick. As tears of wot:
burnt her cheeks, she sat down by the curb-
side, with the childrens' mocking laughter
ringing in her ears. For an hour or more she
remained there, with her head slumped
wearily between her knees, staring fixedly
down into that precipice oi doom.
Spontaneously, a series of images welled up
before her...she saw herself standing with her
children on the edge of the chasm.
T h e n she knelt down, made the sign of the
cross, and turning to Augustine with a
twisted half-smile, violently pushed her into
the gorge. As she heard the sound of her
daughter's hideous scream die down in her
ears, someone tapped her lightly on the
shoulder...
'Leave me alone,' she moaned, still swooning
Irom the vividness of her macabre vision.
'Mummy, mummy, why are you kneeling?' asked
a familiar voice.
'Oh! Jade, my darling!' Sue c r i e d
ecstatically. 'And Augustine, you're alive!'
Hugging her daughters to her heaving breast,
she smothered thern in kisses ol rapturous joy.
'.Susan, are you all right?' inquired a deep,
sonorous voice Irom the past. In vain, Susan
tried to regain her equanimity. She just
managed to return her ex-husband's greeting
with a thin smile.
Aghast at the connivances of late, they
gazed silently at each other.
'It's uncanny,' Peter exclaimed. 'Andyou've
asked him lo come here! To our hotel room. What
audacity! Susan, haven't you come down from the
morphine injections they gave you in the hospital? I
have no wish to see Virgil...1 refuse outright!' Peter
thundered, bringing his fist down on the table
to emphasise the vehemence of his taunting
words. 'And I forbid vou lo see him either!' he
added, his eyes ablaze with jealousy-
Sue, for once unperturbed by her
h u s b a n d ' s s a r c a s t i c r e m o n s t r a n c e s ,
announced with that calm deliberation ol
which only women are capable.
Tf> are all to be re-united.' The young man
broke into a scornful laugh.
'Just what makes you think..'
'He's bringing the children,' Sue interrupted.
'I'm sorry., but I'm still bewildered .in God's
name, it hat difference does that make? A re they some
kind of talisman, do they magically transform mens
lives by their mere presence? Tell me...I'm waiting.'
Peter jeered, folding his arms in a gesture of
impatience.
' You know you are endeared to them Peter.
Why do you act out this pantomime of indifference?
Don't you remember how we three began?'
'Yes I do. You and Virgil corrupted an innocent,
guileless specimen of nineteen.'
'Corrupted indeed, Sue rejoindered in a
teasing tone. 'Peter, none of us were exactly angels
of virtue.'
'.Xo well. I should never have accepted such a
portentous invitation', Peter remarked, recalling
the events of some six years ago.
'Virgil and I didn't know what would become of
it. Troilism is not a common practice... in one sense,
we were as naive as you.. .perhaps more so. For il was
our joint decision to form a menage a lrois...it was
like administering hemlock to the lips of our
marraige,' Sue added as an after-thought.
'An enchanting simile...but you're right.
Troilism transgresses the very ethnical fabric of
society : hence its fascination,' Peter continued
philosophically. 'Hut wait. What have Augustine
and Jade lo do with all this? by the way, how are
they?'
'Peter. Sit down,' Sue ordered tersely.
'What.'
'Sit down, please. Here, next to me,' Peter
obeyed his wile's edict, sensing the ominous
change in her tone of voice. After a briel
silence, Sue proclaimed, 'Peter, you are a
father.'
'Yes I know', he answered, his voice tinged
w i t h a n a d m i x t u r e of p r i d e a n d
disappointment.
Wo I don't mean by thai whore woman Lucy.'
'...then with..what..whom?..how?' Peter was
as confused as he sounded.
'You are the father of my youngest daughter
Augustine.' Susan looked her husband straight
in the eye.
'Is it possible? How - wail - are you sure?' Peter
ransacked the recesses of his memory lor
evidence to confirm this astounding
revelation.
'Without doubt,' Sue assured h i m .
Speechless with emotion, Peter embraced his
wile...the only woman he had ever known
whom he had wanted to bear his child.
'Oh! Mind my stomach...it's still extremely
lender'. Sue exclaimed.
At that moment, there was a knock at the
door
