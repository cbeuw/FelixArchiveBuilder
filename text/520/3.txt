The Life and Times
of an E C Cushion
How are you all, out there in
e x a m land? I hope all this
nailbiting revision and exam
s t r e s s i s n ' t l e a d i n g to
excessive self abuse or any of
the other m y r i a d of evils that
can cause you to go blind (so
I'm told). T o provide you with
light relief and give you a
break f r o m all that viscous
flow, m a s s transfer and
vector fields, I'll inform you
all about the temporoary
parking permit scheme that
is to operate over July.
T e m p o r a r y Parking Permits
If you have a permit already,
then by now you should have a
letter from me telling you that if
you want it renewed for J u l y ie -
you actually intend to use it for
July then you have to come and
let me or Annie in the U n i o n
Office know by J u n e or it will be
automatically reallocated to
someone else and you will lose it.
If you have not got a permit
already, and want one for July
t h e n c o m e a n d p i c k a n
application form from the U n i o n
Office and fill it in and hand it
back to A n n i e by Friday June
8th. Please take note: O n l y have
your permit renewed or apply for
one for J u l y if you genuinely want
to park your car in college
regularly over July, please don't
apply for one just in case you
might need to park in College a
couple of times over J u l y - you
only make things worse for people
who want to park in college every
day.
Well now that I've got my
name in the F E L I X sports' pages
I have virtually achieved the sum
of my ambitions; all I need to do is
get a request for Tansy and myself
on I C Radio and I can disappear
into that great U n i o n in the sky-
where everybody wears leather
underwear and thigh length P V C
boots.
A n y w a y folks, enough of these
obscure jokes a n d obscure
perversions.
See you about (perhaps).
M i k e E l k i n
P.S. Thanks for the U G A , M a r y !
