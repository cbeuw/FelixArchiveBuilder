W O R D S N O T A C T I O N
About 30 students lobbied IC's
Governors last Fridav to ask
College to charge overseas
students the same tuition fees as
home students and for a hardship
fund to help students who cannot
meet increased fee levels next
session.
But the Governors decided that
College could not afford to
abolish the fee differential and
were unwilling to change their
policy on the hardship fund.
Students should expect 'cost of
living' increases in fees each year
and a hardship fund could not
cover this, they said.
. The Rector said however that
he would make a statement saying
that he did not like differential fee
levels for overseas students.
A n d students currently on part-
time courses who will be hit by fee
increases of up to 200 per cent
next October will be eligible for
assistance from the hardship fund.
U N I O N G R A N T C U T
The U n i o n will have its
anticipated expenditure cut by
almost £8,5000 next year as the
College has not met their claim of
£134,000.
The sum of £123,525 granted
represents a 9 per cent increase on
this year on a per capita basis. A n
additional £5,000 is provided to
support the employment of
temporary U n i o n stalT.
The original sum requested was
arrived at by totalling the grant
claims of every club, sub-
committee and other U n i o n
bodies.
U n i o n P r e s i d e n t M a r y
Attenborough said that there
would have to be cuts in services.

M u m m y wouldn't like it.
