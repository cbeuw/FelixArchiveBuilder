Exams
Most people will have started
exams by now, but when you've
finished please remember that
there are still lots of people trying
to sleep at night or work late for
their exam the day afterwards, so
when you roll out of the Union Bar
pissed out of your head after
finishing, please try to be quiet.
A n d I do still keep a bucket of
water on the balcony outside my
room above the archway to pour
on any excessively inconsiderate
piss-artists.
Freshers' Fair
Forms have been sent out to all
Union societies for next years'
Freshers' Fair; anyone else who
wishes to apply for a stall for any
organisation should collect an
application form from Annie.
Unfortunately, space is always
scarce and precedence will be
g i v e n to U n i o n s o c i e t i e s
(particularly those which hand
their forms in on time!)
To all next years' societies
chairmen
Freshers' Fair and key survey
forms have been sent to this year's
chairmen, so if you want to make
sure that adequate arrangements
are being made for your society,
make sure that your predecessor
has actually bothered to fill the
forms in and return them to the
Union Office. If not, forms are
available from Annie.
