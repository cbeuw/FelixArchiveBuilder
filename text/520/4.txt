Mary Mutters
(despite all attempts to stop her)
For those of you who don't know, you still have me as your President
until 30th June ( despite the fact that we handed over at the Annual
General Meeting last Tuesday). I am still managing to discover lots of
fascinating things to do in the Union office, (as well as drinking sherry!)
but if you have got any problems you think the Union could help you
with it is a better time of year to find me in a state to listen carefully, as I
am less likely to be talking to 5 people at once while simultaneously
rushing off to 3 meetings.
Students required to withdraw
The Annual General Meeting was asked to support my
recommendation (which it did) that the Union receive the names of
students asked to withdraw from college, in order to write to them and
offer our help in following the appeal procedure. The names would be
treated confidentially by the Union, with only relevant officers seeing
the names. If you have any violent objections to this please get in touch
with me as soon as possible, otherwise I will tell the College Registrar
that we are all in agreement.
Accommodation Officer
I am still pursuing the idea of getting a part-time Accommodation
Officer which we could possibly finance from donations from small
college student unions nearby (in return for the use of our Welfare
Centre).
Visit from Sweden
The Rector has agreed to sponsor a return visit from a representative
from Chalmers Student Union. I hope that the President can visit us this
term. We are organising a party for the Chalmers students on exchange
here at the moment in early June so he would be able to lead the songs!
I hope you are all enjoying your exams (sabbaticals don't have any,
hee hee!).
Mary Attenborough
President ICU
