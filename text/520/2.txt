Sir , - Y o u will probably say I'm
being pedantic, but with things
like U n i o n policy you have to be.
T h e policy we passed at the last
U G M does not mean what it
appears to mean at first glance.
There are several cases.
' I C U . . i n s t r u c t s . . . t h a t we
support A L R A ' . We? W h o is I C U
instructing to support A L R A ?
The proposers ol the motion?
'We support A L R A . ' What is
A L R A ? Architects and L a n d
Researchers Association? They
c a n ' t m e a n A b o r t i o n L a w
Reform Association, because
according to notes 2 this A L R A
does not support abortion after 28
weeks, but the abortion law
reform association supports it
between 28 weeks and birth for
conditions more liberal than the
present Abortion Act. (See their
newsletter 'Breaking Chains'
M a y 77).
' I C U instructs delete all
previous policy on abortion.' This
is meaningless. Besides which we
had no policy on abortion. If thev
mean my last motion, that was on
the N A C (an organisation), not
abortion.
Worst of all, because my
a m e n d m e n t w a s p a r t i a l l y
a c c e p t e d w e h a v e ' I C U
b e l i e v e s . . a b o r t i o n s h o u l d be
available free on demand...' and
'instruct the N H S to...always act
with the intention of saving both
the mother and child.' (Child is a
legally acceptable term for a
foetus). If these can be reconciled
at all it can only mean we support
Abortion on demand (removing
the child from the womb) only if it
is done in such a way as to avoid
killing it (almost impossible).
O h dear. It appears we
f i l l i b u s t e r e d it. A n d q u i t e
unintentionally.

P.S. What's the use of increasing
day care facilities if the N H S is not
allowed to use them?
Dear Sir, - In last week's F E L I X ,
there was a small ad for the sale of
tins of ex-boycott baked beans - to
quote - ' O n l y 90p for a 51b tin'.
There was also a reference to the
sale of these tins in News in Brief
headed 'Cheap Beans'. I fail to see
that unless these beans are
individually wrapped or of
extraordinary quality or size they
can be termed cheap. In Waitrose
a 20oz tin is 18p - this means only
72p for 51bs of baked beans. (I
have checked this carefully -
being a mathematician). I was not
aware that generally large
quantities bought from a discount
warehouse worked out more
e x p e n s i v e t h a n s m a l l t i n s
purchased in a shop.

would only cost 88p for 51bs.
Dear Sir, -1 would like to make it
known that the events of Saturday
night (shortly alter the England -
Scotland match) disgusted and
appalled me. That alcohol should
be consumed in such quantity for
such unconstructive and heathen
purposes is barbarous, and the
sight of drunken Northerners
lying on the floor came as a
revelation.
As a result I do not intend to
touch alcohol until at least the
next bank holiday, and would
urge all like minded students in
joining me in abstaining from the
practice of imbibing that infernal
liquid, alcohol.
Yours displeased,

Dear Sir, - I would like to make a
few points as regards M r
Bambridge's letter last week. The
Insurance policy covering the
possessions of those living in
c o l l e g e - r u n r e s i d e n c e was
changed at the beginning of last
August for several reasons - the
new policy covered goods lost all
over the college campus, whereas
the old one only covered each
person's particular hall/house/
flat, and the other main reason
was that the cover was increased
to £750, whereas the old policy
was only £500; which I'm sure
most people would agree is
inadequate - a lot of students have
stereo systems worth more than
£300 never mind anything else.
The £75 limit on records and
cassettes is unfortunate, and is
mostly due to the incompetence of
Endsleigh. The original letter I
had from them about the new
policy went over the changes but
failed to mention this - and I was
later verbally told that this 10%
limit for records, cartridges and
cassettes was the same for the old
policy and being unfamiliar with
the old one I took this to be true,
and it was only much later on that
I found out it was different.
Also with the old policy if you
had goods worth, say, £1000 and
£300 worth was pinched you
would only get £150, as the total
value of the goods owned was
twice the limit-this is not the case
with the new policy.
One thing M r Bambridge has
neglected also is that the old
policy, as in common with most
household policies, insured not
the replacement value but the
present value, taking into account
deterioration so the claim for 45
cassettes would be considerably
less than £230.
As regards the policy itself and
the changeover, this year's
experience will be taken into
account when considering the
renewal of the policy, and
M i c h a e l A r t h u r and I will
definately look for and consider
any alternatives very carefully.
I did inform people of the
changeover in F E L I X at the start
of the year several times through
my articles and also by a small
advert; I would have informed the
Wardens of the halls/houses
except I thought Residence Office
would do that. I could not take
the change of policy to a U G M as
a decision was necessary during
the summer vacation.
A n d now for s o m e t h i n g
completely different. M r R o n a n
in his letter of last week is
incorrect when he says a new-
society can overlap with an
already existing society. In
council minutes it is stated that if
the overlap is too great then the
n e w s o c i e t y w i l l not be
recognised.
Cheers,
M i k e E l k i n
Dear Editor, - Each week F E L I X
is put on my desk (such a nice
young man brings it round) and
when I stop for my hot and
steaming life saver, I pick it up to
read. However, I do have one
gripe about your estimable paper
(the covers are such pretty
c o l o u r s ) w h y so m a n y
abbreviations?
Presumably those in the
societies involved know what they
mean but those of us to whom IC
(translation given on request) is a
living and not a social event, very
often do not have a clue. O n the
letters page alone, I picked up the
following: A G M , U G A , R C S ,
I C U , S C C , I C W A , N A C , B P A S ,
P A T A . I am sure the remaining
14 pages would have yielded a
wealth of others.
M a n y times have f laboured far
into the night, coffee and
cigarettes at my elbow, poring
over F E L I X with pencil and
paper, dictionary and IC (see
above) Handbook trying to make
head or tail of it. Perhaps the
average student at IC (think
about it) has more up top than I
have - or maybe it really is a secret
formula for turning lead into
gold!
For those of us who are not 'in
the know' please translate some of
these symbols to make F E L I X
intelligible to the uninitiated.

Dear John, - I would like to thank
you for your prompt coverage of
R C S events but 1 feel I must
correct the errors in the article
entitled Stripper Out, based on a
motion, passed at R C S U General
Committee, which I proposed.
Firstly, the motion made no
mention of the stripper and so it is
not union policy to remove it.
This may well occur as a
consequence but will have to be
decided at a later date by the ents
committee.
Secondly, the reference to
undemocratic minorities was not
aimed at the women at I C but
those people who go to the
Smoking Concert to disrupt and
drink the free beer.
Finally, I would like the chance
to publicly explain why the name
will be changed to the Head lights
Revue. Everyone at General
Committee, and I think generally
throughout College, agrees that
the 'Smoking Concert' has reach
ed the lowest possible depths and
the very fact that the 'Smoking
Concert' is a tradition means the
only possible way to achieve a
worthwile night's entertainment
is to change the name and thus
bury the memories of the farces of
the past.
A n y budding theatrical person
who thinks they would enjoy
producing a class revue and
anyone who could contribute
with a sketch which will be well
rehearsed and entertaining, no
matter how depraved, can see me
anytime.
M a n y thanks for letting me
explain the change,
R i c h Archer R C S U Enter-
tainments C h a i r m a n elect.
