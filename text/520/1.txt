Sabbaticals
to Pay Tax?
Student Unions will have to pay the Government at least £700 for each
of their sabbatical officers following a ruling by the Department of
Health and Social Security in April.
With four sabbaticals IC Union will have to find another £3000 per
year at a time when the College has already forced the Union to cut its
budget next year.
The money will go to cover national insurance contributions and
income tax, both of which have up to now been ignored by Student
Unions.
The D H S S have ruled that sabbaticals are employees of the Union
and therefore national insurance at the rates of 6.5 per cent employee's
contribution and 13.5 per cent employer's contribution has to be paid.
The order is effective from 6th April 1979.
The snag is that to pay the from him. This could amount to
national insurance Unions must
inform the Tax Inspector and will
therefore no longer be able to get
away without paying income tax.
Although a few Unions have
paid income tax, including the
National Union of Students, most
have never done so and the Inland
Revenue have not until now been
aware of the anomalous status of
student sabbaticals.
So that an IC Union sabbatical
can continue to receive a net
salary of £1,990 (1978-79 rate), the
Union will have to pay a gross
salary of £2,390 of which the
additional £400 covers national
insurance at 6.5 per cent and
income tax over the two tax years
which the sabbatical term of office
spans. Added to this is the
employer's contribution of £323
giving over £700 at 1978-79 rates.
The sum is likely to go up as
sabbatical salaries increase.
The sabbatical officer himself
could however gain, provided he
does not get a job as soon as he
leaves office. For as long as he
remains a student or unemployed
he can claim back any tax paid by
the Union on his behalf in the
current tax year, and there is no
way the Union can get this money
£110 tax paid in the last 3 months
of his office.
But if he enters immediate
employment he may be worse off
than an 'ordinary' student as he
will have'used up'some of his tax-
free allowance.
The new situation will also
affect the position of any overseas
student who gets elected to a
sabbatical post. To take up office
such students will now need work
permits. The N U S have in the past
had an agreement with the Home
Office allowing overseas students
to be sabbatical officers and they
have promised to approach the
H o m e O f f i c e a g a i n if a n y
problems arise.
Because IC Union is outside
N U S the Union have not received
full details ofthe D H S S ruling and
have not yet been able to consider
where this extra cash is to come
from. In the new circumstances
perhaps College will be able to
increase the Union's grant to
cover this unexpected additional
expenditure. After all College will
hardly wish to force the Union or
its student employees to do
anything illegal like evading tax
and national insurance payments.
