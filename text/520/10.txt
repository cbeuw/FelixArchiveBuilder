Singles Review:
Leigh Foster
This is the last one ol these
things I am going to do for a
while, "cos I a m shortly oil for a
holiday in the Bahamas (actually
I"ve got exams like everyone else
but that's boring). Anyway these
are the latest batch ol new and
used singles that IC R a d i o has
been sent: First oil" is Gerry
RafTerty's new single which I am
reliably informed is getting quite
a lot of airplay (Tris has heard it
anyway). Poor Gerry started ofl
with such an enormous hit that all
-his other singles since have been
compared to it. unfavourably
more often than not (you do
remember ' Baker Street' don't
you?) This nasty tactic is used by
record reviewers to avoid talking
about the record in its own right,
for example I could say about this
one; 'Nice try by the Baker Street
man, but unfortunately not up to
the same standard. Lacks the
saxophone and the incisive guitar
playing, cannot achieve the same
success", but I won't.
Kirsty M a c C o l l ; 'They don't
know' (Stiff) I hadn't heard of this
woman before but seeing as the
record is on the Stiff label, I
thought I would check it out (also
because her picture on the sleeve
is quite appealing). H e r voice
sounds uncannily like Poly
Styrene's would if she could sing
melodically.
Nice voice, shame about the
tune., ft could be that M s
M a c C o l l has no intention ol
singing anything of greatei
consequence than this limp ditty,
but if she does I'll sit u p a n d listen.
The Regulars; 'Fool's Game'.
Tipped to be very big, the
R e g u l a r s are part of the
spearhead that Reggae is shoving
firmly into the charts. While this
song compromises slightly in the
direction of M O R , it has a
pleasant effect on the eardrums
Bob Marle y has proved that
reggae can make hit records
without making concessions for
mass acceptance, but then there is
only one Bob Marley. Anyone, by
the way, that says Bob Marley
isn't real reggae can drop dead.
Jean Jacques Burnel; Freddie
Laker (Concorde and Eurobus)..
This gave me a bit of a shock to be
honest. It starts off, as you would
expect, with a bit of Bass guitaring
(almost like 'Peaches'), then it
blisters along at a great pace until
the vocals start, if you can call
them vocals. Someone has had a
c e m e n t m i x e r s u r g i c a l l y
implanted on their vocal track
from the bottom of the Atlantic,
and these are the good points!
Too wierd for me. Wayne County
and the Electric Chairs: 'Berlin' I
have to confess that despite the
fuss being made over her, t have
not heard any of her songs before,
so I can only say what sort of
impression this song made on me.
The ambivalent gender of the
voice is distracting, I am not sure
which M County is at the
moment, but either way he/she/it
has a distinctive style which is not
unpleasant, but does not seem to
fit in with the darkly sinister
backing track. I am told that the
single with the rude title...you
know the one; 'If you don't want
to F.ck me, F.ck ofl! (modesty and
the L a w prevent me from printing
it in full)... was much more
bouncy and singalong, even if the
chorus is decidely not the sort of
thing to sing in the bath while
your M u m is in the house.
Last one but one then, the end
is nigh. T i m H a r t with 'Overseas'.
The name of this bloke rings a
bell, and from the sound of the
song he could have been in some
group like F'airport before any of
us were born. The title lends itself
very nicely to nasty rock-reviewer
type comments like 'Overseas is
where T i m Hart and all his
records should be, the nearer to
Siberia the better', but sadly for
me it does merit further
comment, so I have to think of
something original and witty to
say about it. It has a pleasant
R E C O R D S
enough tune, makes no demands
on your brain, and il it is sunny in
the next two months will
probably be a hit.
F'inally I will ask Tris to give
you a review of the last record
which is from D r Feelgood, and
'As long as the price is right' is the
name of it (as J P says). Well
Tris?...Perhaps!!!...I say perhaps,
Because , not having heard
the record, I don't consider myself
particularly well qualified to
judge it. A h ! . . . Leigh's just about
to play if for me. A n g
abart! having now heard
it) Perhaps!!!Thank you Tris
for that scathing attack and
vicious criticism, I'd better tell
y o u i t ' s p r e t t y s t a n d a r d
Feelgood's fare, not as good as
' M i l k and Alcohol', but just about
the best of this bunch, in fact
single of t.he week, in fact single of
the decade, nobody cares what I
think anyway, you all sit out there
reading this and it makes no
impression on you, well I say this
record is the Greatest single of all
time. Phew! sorry... I get carried
away sometimes. It is exam time
after all. Before closing this weeks
epistle I must thank the person in
F E L I X who has to wade through
this to type it up, also I C R a d i o for
letting me use their studios, and of
course my M u m and D a d without
whom I would not have been
possible. See you next Year!

Boat Club
Double V i c t o r y
British University Champions
At the recent British University Sports Federation Rowing
Championships, two IC crews representing The University of
London, t r i u m p h e d against strong opposition to become B U S F
C h a m p i o n s . The coxed four beat Newcastle and Nottingham
in the final, while Chris Howell stretched his unbeaten run to
seven wins in taking the single sculls. The coxless four
narrowly lost to a heavier D u r h a m crew by 3 feet.
These events were held in Nottingham on the 2000m course, on the
same weekend as Nottingham City regatta. The Boat C l u b also
competed in this on Sunday. The successes were the coxed lours who
won the senior A event and the Women who walked away w ith Ladies
Novice fours.
T h e coxed four, beaten on Saturday in the Senior A linal by
Wallingford School, walked away with the same event on the Sunday.
T h e Ladies fourstarted like a rocket and were always in the lead in their
event, winning by over 30 sees in only a four minute race.
T h e first eight had its first race with a new crew order on the Sunday
and after a promising start, never really put it together and finished a
disappointing fourth, with some work to do before the next regatta.
Back in L o n d o n on the same weekend, another Crew of ladies were
beaten by R e a d i n g University at Putney T o w n Regatta while the Mens
Senior C four reached the final at Thames Ditton Regatta only to
succumb to a crew from Barts.
A l l in all a successful and enjoyable weekend.
Boat Club Overruns Cambridge
The Boat Club T e a m sent to Cambridge Regatta went with
high expectations and lived up to them with IC being the most
succesful club at the regatta, winning three events and a total
of nine races.
In Elite VIIIs a small but high quality entry saw I C racing Jesus
college in the final. A close race was expected, but the winners of the
head of the C a m just three weeks ago could not hold the IC boat who
powered away to win by over lour lengths.
The Senior A IV had to race events similarly proved to be
more often for their prizes with
opposition in the first two races
coming from Star C l u b and
Bedford R C . Both races were won
in a comfortable manner the crew
paddling over to win with barely
a hair out of place. The final was
expected to be a different story,
the opposition from M a r l o w R C
were known to be a fast
combination, and the I C four
knew they had to snap out of their
leisurely ways. The Big Race
Temperament was found and
M a r l o w were left wondering
which way IC went.
The Senior C event saw yet
another final lor this persistent,
but as yet unsuccessful, crew.
After winning by good margins in
their first two rounds it looked
g o o d , b u t i n t h e f i n a l
Berkhamslead School proved just
too strong for IC. The Novice
outside our grasp with both men
and women losing first round.
The most notable achievement
of the day must be the Womens
Senior B crew. H a v i n g only won
their novices the week before,
they found themselves drawn
against a strong crew from
London University. The race
went to plan, however, and after
conceding a little at the start our
girls rowed through to win by 1
1/2 lengths. The next race was
duly won and in the final the
opposition was Girton College -
the fastest womens' crew in
Cambridge with all of its
members coming from the
University Boats. Not intimi-
dated by this our crew were never
headed and won by an easy
v e r d i c t . T h i n g s look v e r y
promising for Womens'Rowing at
IC.
