T T C S D o u b l e
on Ten Tors
by Stuart Blackman
O n the 19th/20th this m o n t h the 20th A n n u a l T e n T o r s walk
took place on D a r t m o o r . T h i s event, organised by the a r m y and
entered by about two and a half thousand walkers, is not a race
but a test of physical endurance and the ability to m a p read
round a basically featureless moor.
Teams walk as sixes and must be correctly equipped before being
allowed to start, all part of the rigorous schedule that has to be
completed on the Friday night. Should walkers be lost through injury,
exposure or exhaustion the team may only continue if four or more
members still remain, if not they must j o i n up with another party on
their route. This is all part ofthe safety precautions necessary to survive
the potential hazards of the moor. T h e courses are 35, 45 and 55 miles
long.
In the past R C S had only
limited success - the lst year
(1976). the ladies only reached the
third Tor. and the men, slowed by
2 injuries, were crashed out at the
penultimate Tor. In 1977 a single
mens' team completed the '55'
with the loss of two. Last year the
ladies, however, excelled and
completed the '35'.
This year was unbelievable in
its outcome. The weather was
beautiful all the way, which made
for dry throats, boiling feet and
wet backs. Apart from that we
could not have asked lor more!
The Ladies team, led by Helen
made a cracking repetition of
their last year's success.
T h e i r p e r f o r m a n c e w a s
outstanding on their 35 mile
route. Despite very difficult
conditions they reached and
camped at their 8th T o r by the
end of the first day. They
continued their course the next
day in as good form, arriving
t r i u m p h a n t l y b a c k in O k e -
hampton at 12.40 as a complete
team. This was more than 4 hours
before the allocated time, and as
s u c h t h e y d e s e r v e e v e r y
recognition and commendations.
The team was: Helen Grogan,
Julia Towns, L i z K a y , Hilary
Carter, Averil Horton, Sunila
Nimalasuriya.
The Men's team was really up
against it. O u r route involved a
lot of tricky map reading around
restricted areas, the penalty for
s t r a y i n g i n t o these b e i n g
disqualification. Although the'
route was 55 miles as the crow
flies, the distance walked was
upwards of 70 miles. Things went.
fine for the first half hour, we
reached the first T o r and set off
pretty fast for the second. The
team was not yet established and
everyone was having his little say
as to where to go and what to do.
T h e r e s u l t w a s t h a t a
democratically formed decision
took us both ways through
Gidleigh C o m m o n , the most
notorious bog on the moor,
By Saturday night, 6.30, we
had reached the fifth T o r - and
had to camp by the sixth to have
any hope of finishing. Things had
got pretty tough for everyone by
that stage and the prospect of a
further 3.25 hrs march was not
unanimously looked forward to,
however we set off and even N e i l
didn't like it! By 9.30 the sun had
set and the cold began to get
through. W e had got to the slag
heap, which, fortunately, was on
the same bearing as the T o r but
not actually what we thought it
was! Afte: some fifteen minutes
discussion as to where we were
and where the T o r was with a
couple of equally bewildered
R A F teams we set off again. After
half a mile we were pretty well
finished, the T o r was a good mile
away and we were within a few
hundred yards of not walking any
further. We reached a river,
dropped everything & that was it
for Saturday. About 40 miles
behind us and 30 to go, but with
Neil's stew, five cups of tea and a
blissfully warm sleeping bag in
between.
Fox started up a relentless hail
of abuse at 4.15 which continued
until 4.40, no one was allowed
breakfast until his tent was down,
boots on and all but teeth cleaned,
but it worked and we were olf
again at 5.10am. The next two
stretches we belted, doing the 12
miles in 2 hours 25 mins. This put
us in a good position to tackle the
remaining 3 tors. It did not,
however, alter the impending
problems of performing said
march. It is not really within my
ability to describe the last
eighteen to twenty miles without
sounding melodramatic and
possibly ridiculous. It was the
most punishing experience I have
ever had and one I don't think I
would wish to repeat. It was
through Chris's leadership and
Michael's example, that we made
it, but everyone played a part,
Dave for his fine front walking
and map reading. M o for making
me feel that if he could suffer his
feet then so could I, and Neil lor
his excellent performance as
mother and his fine example of
what 24 hour cycling marathons
can do for you on T e n Tors.
W e made it in by 3.45, the
fourth complete team ofthe 20 on
our route and in the middle of the
R A F teams. W h a t made this
possible, because it was really
quite ridiculous that we should
have done it at all, was the fact
that the team was one.

Appeal: Can all outstanding
articles (if any) for the freshers
booklet be given to Andy Lewis
(Megagit) as soon as poss (ie a
couple of weeks ago). Also
a r t i c l e s f o r t h e F r e s h e r s
Newsletter (Don't laugh) be in by
or during the last week of term.
Note: It might be considered an
excruciatingly brilliant idea if the
Officers' articles for these two
l i t e r a r y m a s t e r p i e c e s w e r e
different otherwise we (especially
me) are going to appear rather
foolish.
