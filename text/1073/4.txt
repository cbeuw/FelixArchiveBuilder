Engineering Fears
N E W S T E A M
The Engineering council has
announced future plans for tougher
entry standards for engineering
degrees. The report, known as SAR-
TOR '96, suggests candidates should
have 24 points or over at A levels to
study for MEng degrees, 18 for
BEng (Hons), and 6 points for a
BEng. There are 10 points for an A
level grade A, 8 for a B, 6 for a C,
and so on.
Several university heads slammed
this approach as being "elitist" and
described it as a threat to the profes-
sion. One pointed out that "there was
very little correlation" between A
level grades of students studying
courses and their final degrees.
The report recommends "fewer
and better chartered engineers and
more and better incorporated engi-
neers." The four year MEng meets
the criteria needed for registration as
a chartered engineer. The BEng
degree course could end up being re-
registered as an Incorporated
Engineering degree, or IEng. The
Engineering Council has plans to
promote these courses. A
spokesman, Robin Bond, said that
"those gaining IEng will not be seen
as failed chartered engineers. By
having a degree specially for the
incorporated rank, we are emphasis-
ing the importance of the practical
approach to the profession."
Vice-Chancellors are concerned
that a low proportion of institutions
offering engineering courses will be
able to ask for candidates to have the
high grades the MEng degrees would
require, with some institutions being
forced to drop engineering.
Postgraduate loans
continued from front page
mittee General Secretary John Gray
phrases it, may well not end up being
very profitable to the students. Not
only does this plan elude-the real
problem of Higher Education fund-
ing, but, apart from one-year voca-
tional students for whom this plan
may come in handy, most suscribing
to this plan will find that, despite the
preferential terms, this loan can turn
out to be a time bomb ready to deto-
nate at the end of their three years of
postgraduate study. In any case, this
plan does not modify the intrinsically
morose situation of postgraduate
education. For this plan to be seen as
a real encouragement, the students
would need to be, as Mr Gray puts it,
"pretty confident they will get
straight into a big money job", which
is unlikely to be the case for most.

Polys above Oxbridge in citations index
N E W S T E A M
New light has been shed on the
"new" versus "old" university debate
this week with the publication of
eight fund-holding council asses-
ment overview reports.
Some former polytechnics scored
very highly, while other more estab-
lished institutions attained less than
glowing results. These reports, pub-
lished by the Higher Education
Funding Council for England, cover
eight subject areas and are a collation
of the results and recommendations
outlined during the assesment of
individual establishments during the
95/96 academic year. Each universi-
ty and college was awarded a specif-
ic number of points in each of the
areas: curriculum design, teaching,
learning and assesment, student pro-
gression and achievement, learning
resources, student support and guid-
ance, and quality assurance.
The standard of higher education
in English universities has been
shown to be high, with most univer-
sities achieving good scores in most
or all of the above areas. The quality
of courses has since been approved
by the funding council in all but six
cases.
Among the consistent top per-
formers are the University of
Northumbria, Queen Mary and
Westfield College, Sheffield, Hull,
Warwick, and University College,
London.
Also issued last week were the
results of a survey by an American
based organization regarding the
research strengths of British univer-
sities. The Institute of Scientific
Information, which monitors science
publications, published their report
on university research which took
four years to compile. The ISI
assessed research in twenty-one
areas and ranked institutions accord-
ing to the total number of citations
received and the number of citations
attained per paper for each field, the
latter allowing smaller universities to
be compared more equitably with
larger, more reputable ones.
Careful examination of the conclu-
sions drawn shows that Oxbridge
research strength is very high, with
Oxford earning a place in the top
three for 17 out of the 21 fields
included. Cambridge, slighltly lower
down the scale from Oxford, came
top in seven fields.
Other establishments also fare
very well. Imperial College top the
league for citations per paper in both
Clinical Medicine and
Pharmacology, as well as falling
within the first three for
Mathematics, Ecology/Environment,
and Immunology. Imperial also
dominates the "Total citations" table,
being one of the top three universi-
ties for seven out of the twenty-one
research fields assessed.
Welsh student
aims high
A Welsh student studying at IC has
declared her ambition to become the
first person from Wales to go into
space. Rhian Felstead is studying
Engineering and French.
She has set her sights on travelling
to Toulouse, the headquarters of the
French Space Agency, for her year
in Europe. Although Rhian has
always been interested in the final
frontier, her desire to journey into
space was recently ignited when she
met Helen Sharman, the only Briton
to have gone into orbit. "The way
she talked about what it was like,
how she felt....I was fascinated." The
first step toward space, learning to
fly, will have to wait until she com-
pletes her degree, as Rhian was not
quite tall enoughtoenter the College
Air Squadron. However, she refuses
to let such a setback block her
progress "Being in space and experi-
encing it for myself. That's the ulti-
mate thrill."
