...When library users had a lucky
escape as bits of concrete started
falling just inches from unsuspecting
students. The library was in the mid-
dle of building work that would add
two extra storeys and extend the
ground floor.
Just hours before Felix went to
press, a four ton lump of concrete fell
from the ceiling of the walkway just
outside the library entrance. Nearby
workmen observed that "it would
definitely have killed anyone under-
neath it." Mr Ian Gillet confirmed
that nobody had been injured but ner-
vously joked that someone had "felt a
draught down the back of his neck as
it fell."
The incident prompted an investi-
gation into safety on the various con-
struction projects around campus but
unfortunately was not the last to
befall work on the campus.
On a brighter note for construction
work, the Union saw the transfor-
mation of its Ents Lounge into the
glittering spectacle of dBs, the culmi-
nation of two years of strategic plan-
ning. The £0.1 million project
designed by the College's CAD
Office just made its building sched-
ule in time for the grand opening.
Events and Marketing Manager
Mark Home, commented that the old
Ents Lounge had been like "a sixth
form disco" and looked forward to
getting the crowds in. A term's worth
of usage seems to have bome out stu-
dents' initial impressions that it was a
significant improvement on the old
"dark blue box,"wifh the room being
packed most lunchtimes and on ents
nights.
The entertainment front was also
given the boost by the news that
Imperial College Union was one of
the few in the country to serve
Guinness after NUS Services Ltd,
the group that supplies all NUS affil-
iated unions, fell out with the compa-
ny. Regulars in the Union Bar looked
smug in their newly privileged posi-
tion.
Smugness radiated elsewhere too
as Imperial's Boat Club triumphed
again, this time at Henley. In a round
up of the summer sport, Felix report-
ed an elated rowing team scooping
the Grand at Henley for the first time
in the club's history.

The University of London Union's
year got off to a bad start as they
lost one of their sabbatical officers
before term even started. Claire
Lawrie, a former LSE student who
held the position of Deputy President
for Finance and Services for approx-
imately one month before resigning
due to "family problems."
The U L U President, Sarah White,
sometime President of ICU, assured
members of the Union that "... the
service that we provide has not been
affected." However, the ULU stall at
ICU's Freshers' Fair seemed to be
somewhat disorganised, with Ms
White scurrying around due to a late
delivery.
Meanwhile, back at U L U central,
the papers went up for nominations
for the sabbatical post. By the close
of nominations, only two people
were fully seconded, Nick Dearden,
an MSc student from LSE, and Ben
Hughes from Royal Holloway. Mr
Dearden turned up at ICU to advise
our sabbaticals which way to vote, a
clear breach of U L U election rules.
Naughty boy.
Closer to home, the Royal
Geographical Society unknowingly
hosted a stripper at the City and
Guilds Union's freshers' reception.
The stage show, organised as a sim-
ple publicity stunt by the C&GU,
barely raised a murmur around
College, though one of the College
Tutors, Dr Gareth Jones, commented
that he was "very disturbed to hear
that it happened."
The RGS were less than amused,
and threatened never to allow anoth-
er Union event on their premises.
ICU President Eric Allsop suggested
to Guilds that it probably wasn't such
a good idea but conceded "that how
they present themselves to the stu-
dent body is ultimately their deci-
sion."

Sadness over closure of 'excellent'
Montpellier Hall headed the front
page story of issue 1065.
Montpellier, the last of College's
postgrad only halls, has been ear-
marked for closure in September
1997, with the loss of 75 beds. Senior
academics questioned the decision,
voicing concern over the priority of
postgraduate accommodation.
The decision to close the Hall was
taken by College's Management
Planning Group, in view that it could
not really postponed much longer.
The Hall faces a renovation bill of
£600,000. Not everyone was happy
with the closure, however. Dr
Richard Clark, warden of the Hall,
"expressed sadness" at the decision,
at that it would be "a great loss."
Back to the antics at U L U , the
election for the vacant Finance and
Services sabbatical took place. Nick
Dearden, favourite of the previous
incumbent, won convincingly despite
worries over a pre-campaign inter-
view he gave to Felix the previous
week. The interview went against
U L U electoral regulations, but, luck-
ily for Mr Dearden, the Elections
Committee chose not to prohibit his
nomination.
The "casual ballistics" of a
drunken Southside guest were con-
sidered lucky not to have injured
someone after one a "friend-of-a-
friend" of a Southside resident threw
a full can of beer off the roof of the
Hall. The can arched gracefully into
the lounge window of a mews house
behind the Hall. The resident was not
pleased, and somewhat shocked, but
still magnaminously conceded that
"we were all students once." The
Southside student was not quite so
lucky and faced a disciplinary
Residences Tribunal.

At the start of a recurring theme,
Clayponds' security came under
the spotlight. " A spate of crime at
Clayponds, the College's South
Ealing residential estate, has been at
the centre of rising complaints of
'inadequate' security at the site"
began the article, pointing out that
the current rate of one theft every ten
days was quite appalling. After an
initial spat over figures, with some
College authorities claiming that
there had been no break-ins for four
weeks, the debate, carried out in the
medium of Felix's letters page began
to centre on the proposed security
measures.
Students wanted deadlocks, the
College said that it couldn't afford
them without upping the rents. The
students wanted deadlocks, as rec-
ommended by local crime prevention
officers. The College installed a
"man and his dog", who stayed, in
the main, in his van. The students
wanted deadlocks and bars, "We
wouldn't mind it looking like
Alcatraz if we got to keep our stuff."
said one. The College installed some
carpets instead, at cost of £163,170
(including VAT) and sent round a
questionnaire. The survey revealed
that the students were not prepared to
pay extra rent for extra security.
Another theme that kept popping
up during the term, again connected
to money, was the threat by the
Association of University Teachers
and other higher education unions
to strike over their 1.5% pay offer.
At this stage, the unions were ballot-
ing their members, but the result was
widely predicted to be a
unanaminous 'yes', which would
herald the "first wide scale industrial
action in H E for ten years." David
Treisman, General Secretary of the
A U T summed up the employees feel-
ings "All groups in the public sector
have had to deal with an effective pay
freeze over the last two or three
years, but university staff have been
outting up with one for fifteen."
The NUS immediately pledged to
support any strike, whereas ICU
were slightly more reserved in their
support. "The A U T have a perfectly
valid protest, and so we'd like to
back them on this issue. However,
