2 The Felix Weekly Echo
BOOKSTORE TENDER AWARDED TO LCC
College officials annou-
nced yesterday that the
London Church of Christ
had successfully fought
off rivals Dillons,
Waterstones, and the
Sock Shop to become
the new operators of
the ex-Union Book-
store.
Mr J H Christ, acting as a
spokesman for the LCC, des-
cribed the decision as "divine."
A delighted Mr Christ went on
to outline the planned improve-
ments; "We intend to increase
custom by holding informal
meetings, discussions, tam-
bourine lessons and talking to
people on a one-to-one basis.
If anyone has any problems,
any problems at all, or are feel-
ing vulnerable, or are seeking
meaning in their life, they must
feel able to come and discuss
things with us," he explained.
When questioned on rumours
circulating that LCC are an evil
brainwashing cult and will not
be selling textbooks at all, but
instead trying to indoctrinate
people and persuade them to
part with all their money, he
responded; "That simply isn't
true. But if anyone feels the
urge to give us large quantities
of used banknotes, we won't
discourage it."
Asked if the new bookstore
would only sell copies of the
Bible, the shaven-headed Mr
Christ replied "No! No, no, no.
Not at all. Well, actually... yes.
We feel it may be risky to diver-
sify too much in the early
stages."
There has been much dis-
cussion in recent months over
the loss of revenue suffered by
the Union as a result of losing
the bookstore. The LCC
spokesman was quick to offer
hope to Union staff; "If you'd
like to discuss it further, we will
be holding an induction
evening on Tuesday where we
will answer queries. It's at my
place, with tea, Jaffa cakes,
spiritual bonding and ritual sex.
See you there."
Registry Office seal of approval for sex change op
Last Wednesday, the
Registry Office announ-
ced a radical plan of
action to redress the
balance of IC's male-
/female ratio.
Starting next year, all male
applicants to Imperial College
will be made aware of new
bursaries available to those
who opt for full sex-change
surgery upon admission.
Developed at St Mary's by a
team of frustrated researchers,
the new procedure makes use
of laser technology and can be
completed in just under five
minutes, with no need for an
overnight stay in hospital.
Existing students will be able to
'chop and change' gender at a
stall during next year's
Freshers' Fair.
Despite a positive response
from students and staff, there
have been loud objections from
the Union Women's group, who
are concerned that no similar
bursaries are being offered to
female applicants. Also in dis-
agreement are the staff of the
medical center in Princes
Gardens, who are threatening
strike action over the increased
workload.
The Registry Department
claim they have the full backing
of the Rector, and remain confi-
dent that their scheme will soon
become an integral part of the
admissions procedure. "Our
ultimate aim is for everyone to
be able to go down to the
Union bar and
pull," said a happy,
n e w l y - e n g a g e d
researcher.
Cold turkey for
cuny addicts
continued from page J
only feasible explaination was
that the whole lunch operation
was merely a front for a vast
narcotics ring."
Sure enough, forensic analy-
sis showed traces of crack
cocaine in the pork biryani.
The ensuing investigation
aims to determine whether stu-
dents buying the curries knew
that they were being supplied
with illegal substances, or if
staff had surreptitiously added
the dangerously habit-forming
drugs in order to boost profits.
In either case, addicts unable
to get their fix of lamb vindaloo
will face 'cold turkey' this
Christmas.
In a brief telephone call from
Kensington and Chelsea police
station, a member of the dis-
graced catering team could
only comment: "Erm... chutney
with that?"
Boffins crack
Mech Eng gene
Dr Crispian Govinda of
the Genetics Depart-
ment announced last
Friday that after years
of painstaking resea-
rch in collaboration
with the Human
Genome Project, his
team had isolated the
gene that leads people
to enrol at university to
study mechanical en-
gineering.
Recognised symptoms include
hair on the palm of the hands,
a low forehead, atrophied
frontal lobes, reduced speech
capacity and an affinity for
greasy spanners. Previous
research had suggested that
this rare affliction was caused
by environmental conditions,
but these latest findings prove
that it is hereditary.
According to Dr Govinda, suf-
ferers often form crude social
groups, giving themselves
names such as "Motor Club" or
"C&G Exec" and spend hours
probing engines with rudimen-
tary tools. Even with gene ther-
apy, complete recovery is rare,
and students showing these
symptoms are advised to seek
medical assistance and coun-
selling immediately.
Barmy MP opens
booze palace for
qutter experience
SW7 nightlife looks set
to improve following
the recent decision by
local councillors to
grant a bar licence to
disgraced Kensington
& Chelsea MP, Sir
Nicholas Scott. The
former minister for
Northern Ireland
plans to open the
first of a fran-
chised chain of
'blues & booze'
jazz clubs, to be
known as "Nicky
Scott's."
Sir Nicholas hopes that
the seductive blend of
alcohol and music he plans to
offer will entice students away
from the cheaper Union bar.
He claims to have personally
tasted every single one of the
five hundred and seventy two
different drinks and cocktails
available, proclaiming them
"Fantashtic" shortly before
leaving in his ambulance.
Among his own personal
favourites is the house special-
ity cocktail "The Party
Conference", a heady mixture
of whisky and the strongest
prescription painkillers.
Facilities provided will
include topless go-go dancers
and a controversial "Hit 'n'
Run" drink-driving simulator,
with an exclusive bonus
'pushchair level'. The modern
interior design will feature a
gutter room, exclusive to mem-
bers, which will recreate the
atmosphere of a breezy
Bournemouth evening.
