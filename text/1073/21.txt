SLOT MACHINE FAILURE BRINGS
HUXLEY TO ITS KNEES
The Maths
Department's usually
sedate routine was dis-
rupted last Thursday
when the drinks
machine in the Huxley
Building obstinately
refused to function.
Distressed students were found
wandering the corridors,
severely disoriented and experi-
encing hallucinations, nausea
and vomiting. On further med-
ical examination it was con-
firmed that these were in fact
withdrawal symptoms, with stu-
dents suffering from caffeine
deprivation.
An immediate investigation
into the condition was launched
with the initial findings confirm-
ing a dependence on a synthet-
ic vitamin-free blend of cocoa,
powdered milk and boiling
water. If the "drinks" machine
is not fixed within a few days, it
is estimated that the mathemat-
ics postgraduate population
could become extinct if nothing
is done to save them.
Thursday's disaster forced
hundreds
of the shy,

ics stu-
dents to

Millenium bang planned bv Physics
Imperial College's
Dept. of Physics has
received an undis-
closed sum from the
M i l l e n n i u m
Commission, following
its successful bid to
firovide the light show
or celebrations on
New Year's Eve, 1999.
In an ambitious and far-reach-
ing scheme, the Blackett
Laboratory has pledged to fur-
nish London with a display far
surpassing the simple lasers
and fireworks planned by other
cities. Britain's entire remaining
nuclear arsenal will be
launched at the stroke of mid-
night, and detonated at the
edge of space directly above
the Old Royal Observatory,
Greenwich.
Announcing the project,
Head of Dept. Professor David
Eastwood revealed: "By careful-
ly timing the detonations, we
hope to provide approximately
15 minutes of continuous day-
light over Europe." Addressing
concerns over safety, Prof.
Eastwood explained that
nuclear explosions in a vacuum
produce very little fallout, and
that the increased lighting
would be invaluable to revellers
attempting to meet in Trafalgar
Square. The warheads will be
carried into space using tried
and trusted Ariane technology.
Disposing of atomic weapons
in this way is both more enter-
taining and cheaper than care-
ful decommissioning. The
Government has given the plan
its full support, seeing a chance
for Britain to lead the world
towards unilateral disarma-
ment. It is hoped that the resid-
ual atmospheric radiation,
expected to endure for thou-
sands of millennia, will serve as
a proud and lasting monument
to world peace.
Student Debt Award scooped by IC
A student from
Imperial College's
Department of
Computing has seen off
stiff competition to win
Britain's first annual
Student Debt Award,
successfully demon-
strating that he owed
more money than any
other student regis-
tered in the UK.
The winner was announced
during a gala dinner at the Park
Lane Hilton last Friday, attend-
ed by the cream of society's
debt-ridden celebrities and
bankrupt entrepreneurs.
The IC student, who is want-
ed by debt collection agencies
and so cannot be named, wore
a false beard as he accepted
the award, presented this year
by Kevin Maxwell. In a short
speech, the prizewinner
addressed a cheering crowd of
young debt-building hopefuls,
recounting how he had
amassed a personal deficit of
around Â£ 2 7 5 , 0 0 0 through
bogus identities, 13 bank
accounts, multiple student loan
applications and countless
credit-cards. He claimed that,
while many students foolishly
squandered their grants on
textbooks and living expenses,
the prudent spender should
invest the money in drink, drugs
and loose women.
Despite professing only
vague recollections as to where
the money had gone, the stu-
dent jovially recalled how
spending on his heroin habit
had been largely overshad-
owed by his Queens Gate
Terrace flat rent, and how he
had been unable to supply the
3 months of bank statements
necessary to apply for College
access funds, never having
stayed with the same bank for
more than six weeks at a time.
Tory MP blasts medical text as porn
Sir Harold Twistleton-
Smythe, Conservative
MP for Lower Furbleton
West, declared his total
disgust yesterday for
the "unashamedly
pornographic" content
of a medical textbook.
It is understood that he found
the book in the possession of
his daughter, who attends St
Mary's Hospital Medical School.
"I shall be asking questions in
the House over this sordid
affair. I don't know how the
publishers can allow this filth to
be printed." said Sir Harold. The
book is understood to contain
several pictures of naked men
and women from a number of
different angles. Sir Harold was
particularly shocked to find dia-
grams of internal organs and
dissected body parts. "I shall be
writing immediately to the
Chairman of the General
Medical Council about this. This
book is more suited to the top
shelf of a seedy newsagent's
than a student library. In my day
all we had was the occasional
saucy postcard from the conti-
nent." The publishers of the
book, 'Gray's Anatomy', were
surprised at the commotion,
explaining: "The book has been
in print since the nineteenth
century and this is the first com-
plaint we've had." Sir Harold
was unrepentant : "It's indecent
and immoral. It's probably on
the blasted internet too, if I
could just get the dashed con-
traption to work."
At the time of going to press,
members of the House of
Commons have established a
cross-party select committee to
examine the pictures in detail,
and will publish their findings in
a report later this year.
