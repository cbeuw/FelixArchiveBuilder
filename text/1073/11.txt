ij This time it's my
I local MP that's in
W ' t h c h o t w a t er.
David Willetts, MP for Havant, has
resigned as Paymaster-General amid
more sleaze and intrigue, with pre-
dictable reactions: Labour's Deputy
Leader, John Prcscott, along with.
Lynne Armstrong, Labour's prospec-
tive parliamentary candidate for
Havant would even like him to resign
and fight a by-election! Thc
Guardian jumped on the sleaze band-
wagon with gusto, devoting as much
space to a character assassination of
Mr Willctts as it did to Dunblane thc
day after thc massacre .
Thc background to this sorry state
lies with the relationship between
Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer.
Hamilton, a former minister, has
been accused of several parliamen-
tary crimes, including payments for
asking questions in the House, dodgy
stays in thc Ritz and murky dealings
with a lobbyist. To cap it all, he pro-
ceeded to sue the Guardian for libel,
and mysteriously dropped the case
thc day before thc trial began. Into
this delightful scenario stepped
David Willetts, who was a junior
whip when the now defunct
Commons Committee on Members'
Interests was investigating Neil
Hamilton. The only evidence against
Willetts was a hand-written memo to
the Chief Whip about what to do
with the Committee investigating
Hamilton. ".. .[The committee chair-
man] is now expecting to receive a
formal complaint about Hamilton
receiving money etc. He could (i)
argue now sub judice and get [the]
committee to set it aside; or (ii)
investigate as quickly as possible,
exploiting good Tory majority at
| once]" Willetts freely concedes that
this was a poor example a whip's
note, containing to much of what he
thought and too little of what he said.
As a junior whip he would have been
trying to impress his seniors by
dramatising accounts of conversa-
tions. The new Committee on
Standards and Privileges decided that
thc evidence he gave to thc previous
committee was inconsistent in its
own right and with Sir Geoffrey
Johnson Smith, thc previous commit-
tee chairman. "We cannot accept
much of thc memorandum submitted
by Mr Willetts, nor much of his oral
evidence, as being accurate. ...We arc
very concerned that any Member
should dissemble in his account to
the committee and believe this
response has substantially aggravat-
ed the original offence. We have
decided that in any future investiga-
tion of matters of privilege or of
complaints about the conduct of
Members, it will be our normal prac-
tice to take evidence on oath."
Thc committee concluded that
Willetts had sought to influence the
outcome of thc Interests
Committee's decision on Hamilton,
on the evidence of the hand-written
note and Willctts' economy with thc
truth. It assumed that the note was an
accurate record of thc conversation,
that Sir Geoffrey should not have
been talking to him, and that Willetts
lied before the committee. Such a
damning indictment in these times
could only lead to Willetts' resigna-
tion, which he did with a speed and
grace which improves his chances of
re-appearing on the front benches at
some stage in the future.
Most politicians agree that Willetts
was brought to book less for what he
did than that he was a victim of his
own naivete. He was made a whip
after a short time in the Commons
because although his ability was
obvious, he needed some exposure to
the rougher aspects of political horse-
play. His previous career had consist-
ed of time in the Number 10 Policy
Unit, and then as head of the Centre
for Political Studies. With such a
background and intelligence (he was
known as Two-Brains) it was natural
he would undergo rapid promotion.
After four years in Parliament, he
was the first of his intake to become
a Minister of State. Such a career
path attracted jealousy from his col-
leagues, and there were few tears
shed when thc whiff of scandal rose
around him. It seems the Standards
and Privileges Committee were not
immune to this. The committee had
just been created after thc Nolan
report, and it felt that the public's
faith in thc parliamentary process
would only be maintained if it
accomplished its duties with unanim-
ity and force. It consisted of a hotch-
potch of embittered Tories and
Labour MPs intent on party political
advantage. It had already leaked
information, and especially in the
closing stages of the proceedings it
seemed to be driven by partisan con-
siderations. The most obvious case of
this was Quentin Davies, a talented
Tory MP who has never had the
appointments or publicity that
Willetts had. His scorching cross-
examination shocked many Tories,
and his scrutiny of the text on a two-
year old quickly-written note was
unprecedented.
It is saddening that a career built built
up over many years has fallen victim
to the jaundiced mood of the
Commons today, but Mr Willctts
may be one of thc few former minis-
ters who could be in a position to sal-
vage his career. The Committee on
Standards and Privileges has passed
its first test in the public eye, and it
seems the Tories have forgiven Mr
Willetts for his indiscretions. How
long it will take them to forgive Mr
Davies is unclear.

The Weekly Poem
by PoetIC
Leaf Relief
Following a gentle arc,
The river-path among trees
Whose shimmering leaves and dappled bark
Put my restless mind at ease.
The all absorbing masquerade,
Of London's dark and guarded blot
Is held worthless in this leafy shade
Where my city life is soon forgot.
So when I walk with unbalanced gait
And there's chaos in my personal space,
I saunter here to put things straight
And let the real world touch my face.
