...it may mean top-up fees as an alter-

Allsop.

A blast from the past for most on the
South Kensington site as medical
students expressed their anger at
College's plans for their new cur-
riculum at a specially arranged forum
with College academics.In particular,
Dr Rory Shaw, the senior academic
in charge of the new course, came in
for criticism from the students.
Other topics under discussion
included accommodation, where the
medics were assured by Ian
Caldwell, College's Director of
Estates, that "any promise made in
the prospectus would be fully abided
by", and sporting facilities for the
medics. It was announced by Eric
Allsop that St Mary's sports clubs
would no longer have their own team
sin the BUSA championships, to
much derision by the assembled
crowd.
As expected, the social space in
the new Bio-medical Science build-
ing came up for an airing. In response
to demands that the College respect
the medics "closely-knit social struc-
ture," Mr Caldwell countered that
"the College is keen to promote inte-
gration, and there is no reason why
there should be a separate medical
body."
Medical matters of a different kind
were also reported as it was
announced that researchers at
Imperial College School of Medicine
at St Mary's discovered a new link
between Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy and Creutzfeld-
Jacob Disease. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food still
denied that the results were conclu-
sive. A spokeswoman for MAFF
stated that the Government handling
of the affair was not at fault. The
European Parliament disagreed and
extended their investigation in to the
British Government's handling of the
BSE crisis. Elsewhere in the EU,
beef curtains remained firmly shut.

In a much abridged Com-
memoration Ceremony, a bold Sir
Ronald Oxburgh told graduands his
fears that "the quality of education
was being threatened" by the cuts in
higher education funding, he went on
to highlight the College's achieve-
ments and the boat Clubs victory at
Henley in particular, suggesting that
anyone who could help financially in
building the new boathouse should
not "hesitate to let me know."
Medical students reared their
heads again with new uproar at room
allocation in Wilson House, a previ-
ously medics only hall. The residents
claimed that non medical students
had been given places in preference
to medical student in spite of an
assurance that the homeless medics
in question would be given places.
The Warden of the hall, Bryan
Clarke, told Felix that "some of the
rooms had become available for a
short period because some of the res-
idents had travelled abroad on place-
ment." He pointed out that no med-
ical students had applied for the
places when they were advertised.
Student representatives disagreed,
saying that the spare rooms should
have been foreseen, and the dis-
placed students had now found alter-
nate accommodation and thus didn't
apply for the rooms. They suggested
that this was "a well orchestrated
move by the College to start intro-
ducing non-medics into Wilson
House," and went against the grain of
an earlier promise to keep the hall
solely for pre-clinical students after
1998.
Extremism of a different kind cast
a shadow over London as reports of
active fundamentalist Islamic
groups rose after a summer lull.
King's College seemed to attract
more than its fair share of attention as
leafleteers taunted College and
Union authorities by placing them-
selves just beyond the jurisdictional
boundaries. A statement from King's
College Union read "We find it
important to protect our students
form fundamentalism, especially the
religious type. King's has had prob-
lems with such groups of all faiths in
the past."
On a lighter note, the sandwich
makers of the College catering
department came into focus, or more
precisely, their valuing of their own
work. Following complaints about
the price of sandwiches, Felix decid-
ed to investigate... And found that,
while the cost of the materials for
producing a simple sandwich
amounted to about 20p, the prices
varied between those of the College
canteens, those of local shops and
Harrods. The College blamed over-
heads for their higher priced product.
The students, and staff, were unim-
pressed.

The question in everybody's mind
was whether or not the vote by high-
er education workers of all levels to
strike would actually mean IC get-
ting pickets on the gates and a total
shut down. Despite claims that the
vote was "the first time in history...
that everyone from 'porter to profes-
sor' are going to close university
gate" the vote was far from
unaminous. Three of the trades
unions in the higher education con-
sortium voting on industrial action
only made the majority required for
action by 2%. However, Bryan
Wilson, President of the Imperial
College branch of the AUT, pointed
out that the turnout of 59% was high-
er than the average turnout at General
Elections of 50%. This, he said, was
a "reflection of the anger" felt by
staff at "paltry pay rises."
Pro-Rector Alan Swanson com-
mented that he would be "surprised if
the Government turned in their
tracks" as result of the strike, but
speculated that the strike would be
fairly solid among technical staff.
Although this would mean the shut
down of many labs, he left it to
Heads of Department to advise to
students whether to turn up or not.
One definite downer was the
defeat by St Catherine's College,
Cambridge of Imperial's University
Challenge team. After last year's
glorious victory, much was expected
of the four team members. However,
with presenter leremy Paxman urg-
ing them on (the fact that St Cats is
Paxman's alma mater didn't escape
The Mirror's TV critic), the gallant
foursome fell on the last question.
All was not lost, though, they still
went through to the next round as the
highest scoring losers.
In a sudden announcement, Sir
Nicholas Scott, MP for Kensington
& Chelsea, was told that he would
be replaced by his constituency party
as the candidate in the next election.
The executive of the Kensington &
Chelsea Conservative Party decided
to drop Sir Nicholas as their candi-
date after he was found drunk face
down in a gutter at the Tory party
conference. In response, Sir Nicholas
threatened to resign, thus putting the
Government's fragile majority in
jeopardy. He called for a full meeting
of the constituency party to which he
would put his case. The electorate
carried on as normal.

In the event, the miserable and
appalling weather discouraged most
people from coming into College on
the day, but striking staff were
manning the picket from an early
hour. Imperial College was not the
worst hit HE institution by a long
way, but even here the strike had
some effect. Five departments were
closed entirely, and several others
had a 'reduced service'.
The strikers were in a bullish
mood. "The whole of HE is screwed
said one picketer of the proposed
Government cuts. Students came in
for some minor criticism from some
