Songs in Scotland, Sex in Paris and Death in Bavaria
IC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
This was a brilliantly conceived and
delivered programme consisting of
three masterpieces, each written
without conventional sonata form. It
included Delius's first masterpiece (a
nostalgic farewell to the latter part of
his youth in Paris), an early one by
Richard Strauss and one by Bruch
written at the peak of his creativity,
just before he became conductor of
the Liverpool Philharmonic Society.
All three are very generously
orchestrated, lyrical and rhythmically
vivacious; just right to display the
musical strengths of ICSO, which are
now better than ever.
There are several other links
between the three composers.
Bruch's most popular violin concerto
lent ideas to Strauss on more than
one occasion in later life, including
the Alpine Symphony. Half of the
scores Delius possessed were of
music by Strauss, which helps to
explain how Delius learnt to balance
great orchestral forces so well (but
IC Choir
Last Friday night (13th December)
saw this term Is concert of the
Imperial College Choir in the Great
Hall, Sherfield. Having heard from a
number of sources a lot of impres-
sive things about the standard of
singing, and on seeing an almost full
house, I went to my first l.C. Choir
concert with high expectations. As
is common in I.C. there are often
difficulties of varying levels caused
by the male/female ratio; surprising-
ly it is the deficiency of male voices
(there are almost as many male
singers as there are altos or sopra-
nos) that is the problem. However,
this was made up for by some clear
and confident singing especially
from the tenors. It seemed that each
member of the choir knew when to
come in without waiting for some-
one else to follow (a common occur-
rence in some well-known choirs).
I was not too convinced by the
tempo, generally finding them a lit-
tle on the slow side but this was the
only thing which made me feel a lit-
tle uncomfortable. The four soloists
and orchestra were remarkable, par-
ticularly the two sopranos (Naomi
Harvey again and Janet Shell) who
managed to deliver some of the
most horrendously difficult vocal
lines ever written with such ease.
with poetry in place of rhetoric). The
all-pervasive influence of Nietzsche
at that time showed in the work of
Delius and Strauss and encouraged
them in, among other things, their
strong egotism. Delius's consequent
rejection of conventional morality
led to the disease which blinded and
crippled him and which was proba-
bly contracted in a Parisian brothel.
The ICSO performance of "Paris"
gripped throughout, from the atmos-
pheric opening with the plaintive
woodwind solos on to the song- like
violin solo and the final, blazing,
"dawn" section. This was reminis-
cent of JMW Turner's early master-
piece "Norham Castle: Sunrise" now
on show at the Tate Gallery. The bas-
soons took good advantage of the
unusual opportunities offered to them
in this piece. The orchestration is so
multi-faceted that I can only propose
a general vote of thanks to the rest of
the orchestra! The dynamics of this
piece required and received very sen-

IC MOUNTAINEERING CLUB
After a number of destination
changes (ranging from Devon to
North Wales) we finally set off on
Friday night in a completely random
direction. Yet again our bus was in
impeccable condition this time stub-
bornly refusing to go overfiftyand
deciding to impersonate a factory
chimney by spewing out about a
tonne of thick white smoke (thanks
to the twonker before us who filled
up with petrol instead of Diesel).
The next morning we made the rit-
ual journey to the pasty shop in
Pembroke for breakfast and headed
off to St Govan's Head. We split up
and headed off to find our climbs on
the beautiful Pembrokeshire coast
line. The more sane of us headed of
for the sunny (and eternally hot)
crags at St Govans and Saddle Head
to some quite stunning climbs.
Special mention has to be given to
Amir and Gareth for theirfirst(sec-
ond, third and fourth!) leads and to
Dave who identified completely the
wrong climb and took about an hour
puzzling why there was no protec-
tion and no holds! Dave also finally
lead the brilliant Chieftan with aven-
gence after having backed off it on a
previous trip.
While the rest of us sane mortals
were out on the sunny cliffs Rob and
sitive direction by the conductor,
Richard Dickins. It worked.
The virtuosity of the solo violin in
the Scottish Fantasy exceeds that of
Bruch's other violin concertos.
Edward Bale gave us artistry of the
highest order, negotiating the stretch-
es of double stopping with apparent
ease and deploying occasional hints
of portamento and vibrato appropri-
ate to a concerto of the late romantic
period. The piece runs from sombre
to dance-like, from lyricism through
to the war-like finale. The soloist and
orchestra were excellent in all these
varied moods. The performance
stirred up a wish to hear much more
of the work of this neglected com-
poser.
The strings and the brass came into
their own in the great climaxes of
"Death and Transfiguration". The
horns were authentically
"Straussian". The timpanist plays a
most important part in the quieter,
"heart beat" passages of the "Death"
Pembroke
James (the less sane) decided that the
sun was too good for them and went
and climbed a cave! After being
harassed by Air Sea rescue looking
for a fallen walker they joined the
que to do Preposterous Tales, a three
pitch HVS. Setting off in the light of
day they emerged from this grimey
hole in the dead of night (in true
ICMC tradition) as the rest of us
strolled up to see if they were still
alive. After describing a bit of an
epic including slimy holds, pitch
black, broken head torch bulbs and
heads not fitting through cracks
James declared that he wanted to
"give the bloke that put a spare bulb
in the PETZL a big wet kiss"!
The evening nosh consisted of a
rather civilised curry served by a
Welsh-Indian with a very bizarre
accent! We spent the night in the
pub improving inter-university rela-
tions with Exeter and UCL climbing
clubs who had also decided to climb
at Pembroke.
The next day, when we had final-
ly got up and got our pasties, we hit
the cliffs for another good days
climbing, burning off home in a revi-
talised bus (since it had Diesel in it)
to get back (staggeringly) before
Monday.
section. This gives the rare opportu-
nity to praise the sensitivity of the
ICSO timpanist. Similarly, it is
refreshing to be able to praise the
harpists (one as sub-soloist in the
Bruch and two in the other works).
Generally, the "Death" section
(which is actually more to do with
the development of human personal-
ity) is thought to be more convincing
than the "Transfiguration" but this
performance left no such feeling of
discontinuity. Sixty years after the
composition, Strauss quoted the
motif of the "Ideal" in one of the
Four Last Songs and, on his
deathbed, said that his feelings were
just as he'd predicted in this music of
his youth.
The whole evening was a vivid
interplay of solo and tutti work,
visionary and musicianly in detail,
ideally suited to an orchestra consist-
ing of young but mature individual
talents masterminded by a deserved-
ly popular conductor.
AIDS Trust
Fund
Raising
Just over a week ago a party was
held, the purpose of which was to
raise money for the Terrence
Higgins Trust. The party was host-
ed by IQ (Imperial's LCB society),
though it was open to everyone.
The Terrence Higgins Trust is a
charity dedicated to giving care and
support to those people infected
with HIV and AIDS and to doing
everything that can be done to pre-
vent any new infections. Therefore,
they have recently launched a major
health promotion campaign, the
aim of which is to stop more peo-
ple getting infected and to help save
3000 lives by the year 2000.
On the night, we raised over Â£80
for the THT which was beyond any
of our expectations, we also had a
great time. Therefore, we would
just like to thank everyone who
came and supported the event, we
hope you all had a very pleasant
time.
If you would like to know any
move information about the
Terrence Higgins Trust and the
work they do, or if you would like
any confidential advice on safe sex
or other matters, the THT have a
phone line, 0171 242 1010.
