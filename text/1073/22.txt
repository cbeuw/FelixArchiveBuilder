IC BOAT BOYS SUSPECT
IN CLONING
Rowing authorities have slammed
Imperial College's Boat Club in a row
over the Club's alleged use of clones.
The rowing team, who have won the
World Championships in just about
everything, were devasted to learn that
their trophy cabinet may be in jeopardy.
Bill 'Grand Master' Mason, the team Coach
spoke of the club's anger over the charge. "The
team are very angry that other teams have
accused them of being clones. It is totally untrue.
We have never used clones, except in training."
He went on to accuse their opponents of being
sore losers.
Will Taker, stroke in the Henley Grand winning
team, said that "competitions always bring out
the worst in people." His crewmate, cox Billy
Taka, agreed. "It must be disheartening to see us
race away from you after all those months of
training" he said. Power stroke William Taykerr
and number three Liam Cztaecha declined to
comment.
