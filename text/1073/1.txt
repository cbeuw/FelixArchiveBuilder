New BMS accident causes injury
JACKIE S K E A T E
In the latest in a string of accidents on
the Biomedical Sciences building
site, a worker has been seriously
injured when the main gates to the
compound struck him on the jaw.
The incident, which occurred on
Friday 6th, has prompted a change of
procedure on the site.
The man, a concrete mixer truck
driver who was unloading at the rear
of the vehicle, was hit by the gate
after a piece of wooden form-work
fell from its position at nudged the
gate. The piece of form-work (timber
'A' frames used to set concrete) was
in turn dislodged when a crane lifting
another frame knocked it.
An air ambulance and convention-
al emergency services were called to
the scene to attend to the injured
man. After treatment on site for his
jaw, which was described as
"smashed", he was taken to hospital.
This is the fourth incident this year
involving one of the cranes on the
BMS site. Over the summer the larg-
er crane, 61 metres tall and stabilised
by concrete weighing 100 tonnes,
turned the wrong way and crashed
into the Chemistry building. A sec-
ond incident involved a large block
of concrete falling from a substantial
height. This accident led to a high-
level health and safety investigation,
which may eventually result in
changes in design of these types of
crane. On another occasion, due to a
breakdown in communications, a
crane put several tonnes of steel rein-
forcing rods through a window in the
Chemistry building. Four people
were in the room at the time.
Miraculously, no-one was injured.
Following these incidents, Schal,
the main contractor, has established a
permanent Quality Manager on site.
A Safety Manager was also appoint-
ed. In response to the question of
whether further incidents were still
possible, Ian Caldwell, Director of
Estates, confidently stated "We
believe that what is in place should
prevent other problems."
As a direct result of this accident
changes have been made to safety
procedures on site. Form-work that is
stacked up in storage will be securely
tied to the A-frame, so it cannot fall.
Progress on the construction, some of
which is ahead of schedule, should
not be hindered by the new rule.
The injured man state was
described as "stable and recovering"
by College officials, but "would be
drinking soup for a while."

Postgraduate loans scheme introduced
MATHIEU RICHARD
A new postgraduate loan plan is
presently being discussed in the form
of a collaborative project between
Midland Bank and a group of 1
1
British universities, potentially
involving the 30,000 postgraduate
students of York, Durham, Bath,
Essex, Sussex, Exeter, Reading, East
Anglia, Surrey and Birbeck College
in London.
The official aim of this new type of
agreement is to "encourage postgrad-
uate study" by offering the students
preferential terms for bank loans.
Midland Bank will offer loans of up
to £10,000 for fees and maintenance
costs (or £5,000 for one-year cours-
es) at a rate only 2 percent over their
base rate, and repayable for up to
seven years after the end of the
course.
This plan will add, to and supplant
in many cases, the quasi-nonexistent
Research Council studentships and
the rare Government's Career
Development Loans by complement-
ing public funding for postgraduates.
The latter was severely criticised by
Essex Vice-Chancellor Ivor Crewe
as "inadequate to meet the [present]
research needs of this country... and
the future staffing needs of our uni-
versities." Therefore, Mr Crewe wel-
comed the agreement as "a very pos-
itive move" towards more gener-
alised postgraduate study.
Nevertheless, this optimistic view
was not shared by everyone. The stu-
dents themselves, through the voice
of their representing body, the
National Postgraduate Committee,
expressed their doubts as to the real
purpose of this plan and its concrete
consequences.

itable "marketing exercise", as corn-
