That man on the other page, Simon Baker, takes us through his choice
pickings of Christmas televisual 'entertainment'
Ah, you thought my eclectic views
were confined to politics and tm;Fl-
ing projects. Mais turn, for here i
shall present to you, dear reader, my
top tips for the perfect televisual
Crimbo. And, as they say, what a
Christmas line-up it is too. In all hon-
esty, this i:; the'best for many yeses,

brahon at (lie end of December, a fact
oriiitrcc from their diaries last, year
Starting with films, it's hard lo know
where to begin. As you grohably
know by now, Jurassic Park
(BBCi, The B.emtim
of the Day iTVi 10:00pm) are the
big h lie ' ,. •
unusually has the largest number of
must-sees , including The Wizard of
Oz (BBCI, 11:20am), Revenge of
the Pink Panther (BBC 1, midnighl)
and Casablanca (BBC2, 3:10pm) ii
you haven't seen the latter and tail to
watch it this year, I shall personally
send the boys round to ask why. The
Monday before has the brilliant My
Left Foot (C4, 10:05pm), the sole
highlight of the day, but Christmas
Eve does better with Cliffhangcr
(BBCI, 9:00pm), the old faithful
Top Gun (1TV, 9:45pm), Blazing
Saddles (BBC2,10:00pm) and Drop
Dead Fred (C4, 6:45pm). I'm sorry,
the last one is a terrible error, Vic -
my nuclear strength Nurofen have
just kicked in.
Bond fans are not to be disappoint-
ed; Never Say Never Again (BBCI,
Boxing Day, 1:50pm) and, slightly
underrated, The Living Daylights
KlfV, 29th, 8:00pm). As well as
Clouscau, Peter Sellers gets a bit of a
season this Christmas, with three of
his other films- The Battle of the
Sexes (C4, Christmas Day, 6:50pm),
the brilliant send-up of trade union-
ism I'm All Right Jack (C4, New
Year's Day, 5:05pm) and the incom-
parable Dr Strangelove (C4, 2nd,
12:25am). Incidentally, The Man
with two Brains (C4, 27th,
10:00pm), which always, bi/.arrely,
reminds me of Dr Strangelovc is well
worth a look.
Diehard Felix readers will remember
last Christmas when 1 waxed lyrical
about The Italian Job. This is with-
out doubt on of the funniest caper
films ever made, completely timeless
and beautifully cast with Michael
Caine opposite the redoubtable Noel
Coward. If I feared that it wasn't on
this year, not being in its regular
Christmas Eve slot, but am delighted
to say that it is on Boxing Day
(BBC2, 4.25pm). What's more, The

and Louise (BBCI, 3th, 10:20pm),
Die Hard (ITV, New Year's Day,
9:00pm), ET (BBC1, New Year's
Day, 6:10pm), The Birds (BBCI,
Christmas Eve, 12:50am), The
Graduate (BBCI, Boxing Day,
12:05am), Grease (BBCI, 27th.
2:55pm), Raiders of the Lost Ark
(BBCI, 22nd, 8:00pm) and
Shadowlands (BBCI, New Year's
Eve, so video, 8:00pm). There are
also a couple of Carry on films
(Girls , Matron and Cowboy) and a
few from-TV movies, normally, not
to be touched with a barge pole, but
Porridge (BBCI, New Year's Day,
2.00pm) is just about the exception to
the rule.
"Normal" output has not been
neglected this year, with the BBC the
clear winner as it has been since the
dawn of time. Christmas specials are
in abundance, the best being They
Think It's all Over (BBCI, 23rd,
10.00pm), Father Ted (C4,
Christmas Eve, 10:00pm), One Foot
in the Grave (BBCI, Boxing Day.
9:00pm), The Brittas Empire
(BBCI, Christmas Eve, 6:30pm),
The Fast Show (BBC2, 27th,
9:40pm) and Shooting Stars (BBC2,
27th, (9:00pm). First and foremost
however, is the three-part Only
Fools and Horses special (BBCI,
starting Christmas Day, 9:00pm),
which may, apparently, be their last,
although Del Boy has had more
retirements than Frank Sinatra. It
should certainly be the highlight of
Auntie's schedule, and alone con-
stitutes more watchablc comedy than
As the more astute of you may have
gleaned irom my column, I am a bit
of a traditionalist. You would think
less of me if I did: not mention the
Queen's message at 3pm (BBCI,
don't watch it on ITV, it's simply not
the done thing, children) and The
Morecanibe and Wise Christmas
Show (BBC 1, Christmas Day,
10:55pm), without which Britain is
merely an outcrop of land northwest
of Europet Aficionados of quality
television from the good old days
(why did wc make so many quality
sitcoms at a time when the country
was down the pan and half way
round the U bendf?) are in for a real
treat this year.
