The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxbrough, has sensa-
tionally admitted that
he does not expect to
be returned in tomor-
row's rectorial election.
Sir Ronald conceded that his
position would not stand up to a
rectorial examination...
Opinion polls show the cur-
rent front-runner to be showbiz
bad-boy Keith Flint, of popuar
beat-combo 'The Prodigy.'
Speaking exclusively to The
Echo, Mr Flint outlined his plans
to lead the College into the next
century, saying: "I'm the
firestarfer... Twisted firestarter."
Nominations for the post
closed this evening with seven
fully seconded candidates. An
eighth, suspected to be
American, narrowly missed his
flight and thus the nomination
deadline. Legitimate candidates
are summerised below.
Keith Flint: Top of the polls at
the moment is the scary bloke
from the Prodigy. Wants all stu-
dents to fuck off and die.
Hobbies: Fire-starting.
Sir Nicholas Scott: Disgraced
Kensington and Chelsea MP.
Promises to boost the profits of
Flint: Firestarter
Branson: Pickle
Major: Not standing, but could
need a new job in five monrhs
time. A dark horse, slow start,
good in the finish.
Oxburgh: Odd
the bar, and set up an on-cam-
pus pharmacy. Hobbies: Booze,
fags, lard.
Dave Trotsky (Socialist
Worker). Pledges to abolish
capitalism and redistribute
wealth. He hopes to achieve
this by handing out flyers,
shouting very loudly, and hav-
ing an occasional riot.
Hobbies: Being Northern.
Sir Ronald (again): Mythical.
Only the Governing Body claim
to have met him. Hobbies: Tea
parties with lots of biscuits, for-
eign holidays.
Richard Branson: The man
behind the Virgin empire.
Pledges more music, less talk.
Hobbies: World domination.
Princess Di: Promises coun-
selling, all profits to charity, and
to ban moblie phones from
campus. Hobbies: Casual sex.
Marvin the Martian: unavail-
able for comment, though an
aide-de-camp said 'take us to
your leader'. Hobbies: N/A.
Polling stations will be open in
all major departments, the
Union lobby and the Sherfield
lobby. Regisitration forms are
available from all departments,
the Union Office and Sir Ron.
.Relief Busts Pa Vinci's Curry Success
ICU's popular snack
bar, Da Vinci's, was
closed last week fol-
lowing the arrest of the
entire catering staff b y
the Metropolitan Police
drugs squad.
Acting on a tip-off, police offi-
cers with sniffer dogs mounted
a dawn raid on the Union's
kitchens. Their search revealed
large quantities of both hard
and so-called 'soft' drugs.
A police spokesman told The
Echo: "Our suspicions were first
aroused by the inexplicably
long queues for 'pound curries.'
We were mystified as to why
anyone would willingly buy
these suspicious meals. The
