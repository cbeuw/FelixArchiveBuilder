General Election to be held over Easter holidays
N E W S T E A M
Tory MPs from more than a dozen
marginal constituencies are believed
to be swaying John Major's decision
over the date of the next General
Election. These MPs are in con-
stituencies which contain a relatively
high percentage of students. They
fear that most students will vote
Labour in the next election, so they
feel that it is in the best interests of
them and their party if the election is
held during the Easter vacation,
when most students have gone home
for the holidays. Many party strate-
gists see April 10th as the most like-
ly date, and the Prime Minister him-
self has said that the Government
may be forced to go to the polls
before the pencilled-in date of May
1st.
The majorities of Tory MPs in
seats such as Luton, Coventry,
Portsmouth, Oxford and Exeter are
only a few hundred, and with over
ten thousand students in their con-
stituencies they believe that the date
of the election could substantially
influence their chances of re-elec-
tion. Some are already aware that
they only secured their tiny majori-
ties in 1992 because the election was
held on April 9th. On the other hand,
some Conservative MPs lost their
seats in 1992 when students made a
group decision to vote by post in
areas such as Bath, York, and
Cambridge.
A senior Tory spokesman made
the position clear. "If we manage to
have not just polling day but also
most of the campaign during the hol-
idays, we have increased our chances
of holding those seats." With the
government majority at the last elec-
tion a mere twenty-two, then clearly
these dozen constituencies were cru-
cial to determining the government
of the country over the last four
years.
Labour strategists are believed to
be mobilising in preparation for an
April election, and are campaigning
to persuade students to register to
vote. Furthermore, a group of more
than 6000 Labour students are run-
ning a campaign to show members
how to use postal votes, so that
whenever the election is called they
can vote wherever they feel their
vote will be most useful. Their
leader, Ruth Potter, said "If the
Tories go for April, they will have an
advantage because students tend to
vote Labour. But we are working
hard in our campaign." One Tory in
a marginal seat commented "It is a
bit of a dated concept that all stu-
dents are left-wing".
Unsurprisingly, Kensington and
Chelsea is not one of those con-
stituencies said to be atriskfrom the
hotbed of left-wing extremism that is
IC. Despite the turmoil that has

OFFER
The Association of University
Teachers has condemned the 5%
over two years increase in pay they
were offered, dismissing it as "total-
ly inadequate." David Triesman,
General Secretary of the AUT, said
"All HE unions were united in reject-
ing this...Taken as a package this
offer is actually worse than the last.
Members will be very angry indeed."
This means that the dispute will
probably become more disruptive,
with the threat of further strike
action. The AUT have expressed
pleasure that the employers are
showing willingness to discuss the
matter, but, as Mr Triesman points
out, "Real negotiations are needed
urgently."
WILSON HOUSE
After months of negotiations
between College and St Mary's
Student Union, College has finally
agreed to fund part of the cost of
refurbishing the bar in the
Recreational Centre at Wilson
House. The work is expected to be
completed by the start of next term.
As well as being used as a sport
centre and an examination hall, the
Recreational Centre also stages the
annual musical productions by the St
Mary's Hospital Opera Society and
the Medics' Soiree. At the moment,
the bar is only ever opened on such
occasions. After the refurbishments,
which will include the addition of a
table-tennis table, it is expected to be
used as a place for club meetings and
private study. The Warden, Dr Bryan
Clarke, hopes that residents will
make full use of the new facilities to
justify the investments made by
College.
recently surrounded the local Tory
party with the deselection of Sir
Nicholas Scott, this remains one of
the safest Conservative seats in the
country.
Although the effects of students all
voting from home are hard to predict,
it seems clear that the election date
could prove crucial to the outcome of
the 1997 General Election. If you

CONSCIOUS C O M P U T E R
A research group headed by
Professor Igor Aleksander yesterday
unveiled a new type of computer
capable of learning and making an
informed decision given a choice.
The computer, known as Magnus,
has been described as the "first con-
scious machine" and is the product
of over six years work. It is even the-
oretically possible that Magnus
could one day be taught to walk and
talk.
TOXIC PAINT
A more accurate method for testing
for toxic metals in paint has been
developed by Imperial College's
Centre for Analytical Research in
Environment in Berkshire. The new
technique, known as neutron activa-
tion analysis, or NAA, will be able to
provide a reference against which
paint toxicity can be calculated.
This technique could have appli-
cations in the toy manufacturing
industry, where toxicity levels in
paint have to be regulated. Because
NAA is highly accurate, the EU are
demanding that this system should
be used to set the standard. Paint
contains cadmium, mercury, barium,
chromium and small amounts of
arsenic. The upper limits on the
quantities of these potentially lethal
elements must by law be carefully
controlled.
LECTURERS
A recent national survey of universi-
ty lecturers was published in the
Guardian last week. Among those
who took part in the survey, 9% of
lecturers confessed themselves to be
alcoholics, 23% were clinically
depressed, and 60% expressed a
desire to leave.
