8 NEWS REVIEW F E L I X W E D N E S D A Y 18TH D E C E M B E R

strikers, with complaints of a lack of
support being the strongest gripe.
Bryan Wilson of the AUT said that
they were "leaning over backward
not to affect students to much," but
had felt that they had received little
support in return.
The BMS construction work fell
into the news again with the comple-
tion of the safety review commis-
sioned after part of the library roof
nearly killed someone. A permanent
Quality Manager was installed on
site by the main Contractors, Schal,
and the College Safety
Representative, Ian Gillet, was to
tour the site weekly. The Quality
Manager would review the project
over a month and report on his rec-
ommendations, as well as keep an
eye on the day to day running of the
construction. However, concerns
were not all smoothed, with one stu-
dent commenting "I still check the
roof just outside the library just
before I go in."
Rag inflicted the local populace
with their brand of humour in their
annual Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump Rag event. Eight
lucky and plucky souls gathered in a
minibus outside Harrods to see who
would be the last one back to the
Union in a nude running contest. It's
all for charity mind, and the event
always raises a lot of interest.
This year was no exception as a
somewhat less fit competitor was
picked up by the Police. Luckily for
him, they were in a nice mood and
escorted him back to the Union
building to find some clothes. After
reassuring their superior that it was
just a student stunt, one commented
"women and children don't want to
see naked overweight blokes on the
streets." Rag Chair Andy Southern
counted this year's event to be a suc-
cess.
A secret pet was discovered in
Selkirk Hall after one re-app found
himself sharing his morning shower
with a swarm of crickets. Not that
somewhere there was a resident that
kept crickets. No. Selkirk Hall was
host to a tarantula spider, and the
crickets were just its food!
The culprit was soon apprehended,
and the Hall fumigated. The resident
was given 48 hours to get rid of the
spider. The homeless arachnid was
last seen advertised on a notice board
in the Chemistry Department.

The Budget finally arrived and was a
bit of a non-event really. Higher
Education got an extra £200 million,
science an extra £20 million. The
AUT claimed that their campaigning
had reduced the expected cut from
3% to a mere 0.5% in real terms.
Rodney Eastwood, College's
Director of Planning, said that the
extra funding did not reverse last
year's deep cuts, but it was still too
early to say what affect the Budget
would have on Imperial College.
Following the strike action two
week's earlier, HE staff were prepar-
ing to boycott teaching quality
assessments as the next stage of their
protest. David Treisman, of the AUT,
described the Budget as "a change in
the step of decline" of HE funding
but stated that essentially, they were
pinning their hopes on Sir Ron
Dealing's report.
Another success story on the sport-
ing front also with strong Imperial
College involvement was the victo-
ry at the United Kingdom
Championships of the ULU Karate
Team. The team comprised two cur-
rent IC student, a former IC student
and a medic from University College
Hospital. They beat teams from
Manchester, Aberystwyth and
Liverpool on their way to the title.
A week after Lord Sherfield, a for-
mer Rector of the College died,
Nobel Laureate and Imperial College
Professor Abdus Salam passed away
at the aged of 70. A leading light in
theoretical physics, Professor Salam,
also played a major role in many
international organisations, including
the Third World Academy of Science
and as scientific advisor to the United
Nations Educational and Cultural
Organisation.
Autumn saw a mid-term trough for
the Royal College of Science Union
as two of its officers resigned. Both
the Senior and Junior Honorary
Treasurers submitted their resigna-
tions in a bad week for the RCSU.
Senior Treasurer Ann Mitchell, was
forced to resign due to a technicality
in the Union's rules - the HST has to
be a permanent member of staff, and
Dr Mitchell had recently been moved
on to a short term contract. The HJT,
Chris Bragg, on the other hand was
simply annoyed with the financial
incompetence of club treasurers, and
after two years in the job already
under his belt, decided to resign.
RCSU President, Mo Dulloo, agreed
that there were some people who
were "clueless" about financial poli-
cy.

More doom and gloom in the air for
students with the news that the fatal
brain disease meningitis had
claimed two students at Cardiff
University. Five others were still
'under observation' but were gener-
ally though to be OK. It was revealed
that the hall that the students lived
had had a case of bacterial meningitis
five weeks earlier. The President of
Cardiff Student's Union, Dot Hodge,
said the two deaths had been trau-
matic. "Most students of this age are
not used to dealing with this sort of
grief. Our priority is to do everything
that we can to help them cope.
Medics in the news again as the
security at Wilson House became a
hot issue. Four residents of the house
were disciplined under a new rule
that fines anyone who opened the
front door to people with out access
cards. The fines of £10 each were
imposed by the porter after he caught
the students holding the door open
for their friends. Bryan Clarke
defended the fines by saying "A rule
is a rule. It has to be all or nothing for
it to work." Sami Ansari, President of
St Mary's Student's Union described
the move as the "gun-ho approach to
policy typical of IC bureaucrats."
Finally, the long running saga of
Sir Nicholas Scott came to a head.
At a meeting of the full constituency
party he was deselected by 509 votes
to 439, despite a last minute appeal
and the backing of a hundred fellow
MPs. Sir Nicholas backpedalled on
his threat to resign if deselected.
