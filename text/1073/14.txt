Reports suggesting that top Tory
MPs are pushing for an Easter
General Election highlight one of the
few occasions that our legislators
minds turn to that large segment of
the voting public, students. Not, as
you might think, in an attempt to
woo their vote, but rather in a des-
perate scramble to foist these poten-
tially anti-conservative electors off
on some safer MP and away from
their own fragile majorities. The the-
ory is that around Easter, when most
students are on vacation and no
longer concentrated in large num-
bers, the effects of their supposedly
left-wing vote will be diluted and
Conservative MPs with a small
majority will be saved from defeat.
I bet students have never realised
that they instill such fear in MPs
beyond that which a great unwashed
mob generates when they threaten a
prim toff. However, it is a shame that
the effect of most students will be, if
you excuse the pun, marginal on the
fates of MPs sitting on small majori-
ties. Unless, of course, large groups
of students choose to use postal their
vote all in one constituency as the
NUS is pushing for. I must say that
this sounds faintly undemocratic, but
the thought of MPs cowering before
a few students is quite amusing.
Closer to the campus, the Rock the
Vote wagon has slowly been lurch-
ing around London, even pausing to
pick up a few completed voter regis-
tration cards from our own JCR. But
an even better wheeze has been
dreamt up by some publicity wag -
the Spice Girls are to stand for the
soon to be vacant seat of Kensington
& Chelsea, or so reports last week's
Sun. This would, no doubt, cause a
bit of surge in the turnout for this
constituency as students rushed to
cast their votes for their favourite
brand of Spice. Just think - with the
glamourous pouting fivesome on on
the podium with the spectacled and
suited, for some the the choice would
already be made. But don't forget
how broad their appeal could be;
with the Girls claiming Mrs Thatcher
as one of their heroines, they might
just appeal to that other group whose
vote certain a Tory MP cannot
depend upon - the Kensington &
Chelsea Conservative Party. Sir
Nicholas, not being adverse to a bit
of 'spice' himself, would be grinning
all the way to the ballot box.
Lastly, it has come to my attention
that a bizarre global celebration is
coming up. In keeping with this tra-
dition, I would like to wish you all a
happy and prosperous New Year!
