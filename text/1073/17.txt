IC rugby : down but not out
GARETH WILLIAMS
FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT
IC's Gutteridge Cup run came to a
halt against the medics of St
Georges. An explosive firstfivemin-
utes saw tries scored by both teams,
with Andy Mayes replying to St
Georges opening salvo. After the
opening frenetic burst IC had their
backs to the wall, and despite some
courageous tackling were unable to
prevent St Georges stretching out a
healthy lead before half-time.
After the break, IC raised their
game and came storming back at St
Georges. Debutants Kolone Yung
and Matt Fogerty putting in impres-
sive performances. Dan Doherty was
his normal fiery self, and Martin
Byre fancied himself as a fly-half -
though surely without the kicking
skills.
The two heavyweights Geoff
Millet and Rob Gare beefed up the
scrum with Jasper Hyde and Matt
Anstead combining well in the line-
out. Number 8 Paul Hardcastle
capped a good performance by
crashing over the line from a tap
penalty.
For the backs, Chris Mutter and
Dave Gol formed a solid pairing in
the centre, showing touches of real
class. Dave Chatterji was like a
whippet behind the forwards, form-
ing a smooth link to silky skills out-
side-half Gareth Williams.
Persistent IC pressure resulted in a
further try for grease lightning
winger Maru Woodhouse.
Unfortunately it was not quite to be,
as thefirst-halfdeficit proved just a
mite too difficult to overcome.
However, it was still a brave effort,
with IC hampered by the absence of
Jack Peart and Oily Littleton to
ULU.
Our last fixture of the year is the
Christmas dinner, when we will be
looking forward to 1997. IC seem
well placed for a successful cam-
paign in the new year, which could
well prove to be one of our most suc-
cessful for some time.
Fourths humiliate U M D S
Obviously from start to finish IC
dominated this game, to such an
extent that the 7-1 score- line flattered
the UMDS. Individual performance
of the match must go to Sion Hale
who scored a stunning hat4rick. The
first was a penalty following a foul on
Dmitri, then a well taken tap in, but
the highlight was his third, a spin-
ning, curling shot from the right wing
into the top corner. Not bad for a left
back totally out of position!
The other goals were scored by
Chris, direct form a corner, two from
Ryan, including an excellent glancing
header and an own goal created by
Dmitri. For the second time in two
matches Adam hit an unstoppable
shot onto the left-hand pest, and again
played supremely well in the centre
of midfield. His play deserved a goal
and it is a great shame he missed a
last minute penalty.
We had shots inches wide, shots
which hit the cross-bar, and two
headers from only yards out when it
seemed easier to score than miss. All
in all IC were unstoppable. At the
haff time stage in the season we are in
a great position to win promotion,
and having qualified for the National
Stages of BUSA this has the makings
of a famous season for the Fourths.
In this match report I really wanted
to write about a Hitleresque ref show-
ing as little compassion as the ICU
stewards, but the ref was fine, unlike
the powercrazy stewards who contin-
ue to operate a harsh regime where
innocent people are made scapegoats
for more serious offences. It really
needs to be sorted out, but for now
never mind since we're only students
and we don't matter.
R S M leave the rest behind
Following the news that our closest
rival Gold II have now lost a game
and draw one, the RSM had an
opportunity to move 5 points clear at
the top. Although starting early, we
still managed to arrive late at the
ground of Royal Vets due to some
good co-piloting by Roger and Si.
There were a couple of big changes
in the team this time around. Seeing
that Swedish strikers are renowned
for their composure in the box,
something the Scotland-Sweden
game bears witness to, we played
Magnus H. up front. After about 5-
minutes a corner was driven long to
the back post were Neil headed it
back into the danger area. Now
something incredible happened,
something that will be discussed (at
every opportunity!) in the RSM
halls. From out of nowhere Fredrik
step up to calmly place the ball past
at least 8 players + the goalie. His
first goal for RSM, surely many to
come. The rest of the half saw RSM
again having virtually all the posses-
sion but not being able to convert it
into goals. Michel produced a bit of
magic when he left 3 defenders for
dead. The second half saw the game
proceed in similar fashion. Keith
come close with a shoot that struck
the post. Si was brought on when
about 20 minutes remained. He
quickly got control of the ball inside
the box and calmly placed his shoot
in the corner. The two Swedes,
Magnus H and Magnus W, intercon-
nected well down therightleading to
a deep cross to the left which Si eas-
ily headed inn from the tightest of
angles. It seemed we would be
rewarded a penalty when Michel was
"hacked" own in the box. The refer-
ee seemed less convinced and let
play continue. The result of this neg-
ligence was booed by the spectators
similar to the McDonalds add. The
opposition must be commended for
their commitment, although some of
their tackles were reckless. Still a
comfortable 3-0 victory.
London six-pack sees IC Sailing
Club triumphant
At the recently held London Six
Pack, IC Sailing Club tried out their
new and improved team for 1996-97.
Hosted by the University of London
on our home water, the event is one
of the premiere university team rac-
ing competitions in the sailing calen-
dar. IC, having put together a.team
not three days before, went into the
event looking to gain experience for
the forthcoming qualifiers and the
British University Sports
Association (BUSA) nationals.
The first day's racing was blessed
with a good force three breeze which
carried the boys through three con-
secutive victories over strong teams
representing Cambridge, London
and Oxford Ladies. This brought
smiles to Imperial faces especially as
the University of London were to be
beaten by only one other team.
Lunch brought a change in for-
tunes, and the lack of experience
showed as IC conceded some narrow
losses to some very good university
teams. Despite two wins at the end of
the day IC were eliminated from the
finals.
Sunday racing continued through-
out the day with most sailors feeling
somewhat fragile from the previous
nights festivities (including fire-
works and bonfires!!).
The eventual winners were
"Castaways" an ex-London boys
team who showed their experience
by not losing a match throughout the
entire weekend.
