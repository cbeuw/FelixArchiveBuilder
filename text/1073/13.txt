14 COLUMNS F E L I X W E D N E S D A Y 1 8 T H D E C E M B E R
A week last Friday, at lunchtime,
someone suggested that it was time
my photo was changed. I agreed,
thinking that the Schal hat was more
relevant to last year's Felix, when
scarcely a week went by without
some disaster engulfing Campus
Renaissance. This year by compari-
son, things have been going pretty
well, with the BMS a mere three
weeks behind schedule and rising
like the clappers. And then Friday
afternoon's incident occurred, the
details of which you will have seen
elsewhere. Thankfully not as serious
as it might have been, the contractor
concerned nevertheless received
nasty injuries from which we all
hope he will make a speedy recovery.
What is particularly worrying is the
fact that this occurred barely a month
after an independent safety review
and the appointment of a Quality
Manager. The banal response that
accidents do happen on construction
sites is no excuse, particularly when
procedures are supposed to have
been reviewed and tightened up.
It gets worse. The following Monday
evening, a couple of chemists. They
were leaving the department by the
door next to the site over which there
is scaffolding, ushered through by
one of the workmen, who was direct-
Simon Baker
ing the crane driver. Half way under
it, the workman shouted "Get Back",
shortly after which there was a loud
bang on top of the scaffold walkway
such that it visibly moved. Once they
were given the all clear and had
walked under it the workmen laugh-
ingly remarked
that "I've saved
your life. You
could have been
killed." This is
absolutely scan-
dalous. If possible
the worker respon-
sible should be
found and
removed from the
site permanently.
Such a cavalier
attitude will result
in people both stu-
dent and contrac-
tors alike being
seriously injured.
It gives me no
pleasure to say
that the way things
are going some \1r\[r* f ) f R p f l C n n
one will be killed V U 1 C C U L R C U a U U
before this project is over, at which
point the excrement will hit the rotat-
ing machinery with some force. I
acknowledge that putting up large
buildings like the BMS and altering
the Library is an inherently risky
business, and safety is all about man-
aging that risk. If however, the pro-
ject had to conform to some of the
crackpot health and safety regula-
tions that I as a chemist follow, I
doubt very much if they would get
beyond the foun-
dations. Sloppy
safety, like most
working practices,
can inevitably
traced to equally
bad management.
At this point, dear
reader, you would
expect to lay into
my esteemed
friend Ian
Caldwell. Not so,
because it's not his
fault. In fact, I
understand that he
is apparently as fed
up with the lip ser-
vice that Schal are
paying to safety as
the rest of us and
three cheers to
that. The blame
for this catalogue of accidents and
management cockups fall squarely at
the feet of the Schal Project
Management Team, a title that sits on
the list of the world's greatest oxy-
morons between Police Intelligencej
and Belgian Culture. Step forward!
Phil Hilton You are, presumably,}
handsomely rewarded for looking!
after the motley crew of tradesmen!
on the site, a task, which on the basis!
of recent evidence, is one that clearly!
warrants a bit more of your precious!
time, for sake of argument, another!
five days a week. You are however in!
the fortunate position that your
Christmas bonus is not set by me,
otherwise it would be the Salvation
Army soup kitchen for you on the
25th.
Not been a particularly good couple
of weeks for the Conservatives. I'll
rephrase that, it's been apocalyptical-
ly bad, but, eternal optimist that I am,
I always knew it would improve.
On the eve of the Barnsley by-
election I saw that my friends the
charming Spice Girls decided to
enter the great political debate. It
soon emerged that not only are they
Conservatives and Eurosceptic, they
are Thatcherites, proclaiming Lady T
the first Spice Girl. I am in love.
Blair, old son, you didn't make a bad
fist of it, you almost looked slightly,
possibly credible at times (nah!), but
you've had it now.
Call it a day, we've won thej
General Election.
