Deadlock in IC Derby as Seconds tie with Thirds
There was never any doubt that this
was a BIG match. Thanks to the rel-
egation of the seconds last year, both
the second and third teams play in the
same division - hence this derby.
Neither team's form thus far into the
season had been that good but this
match wasn't about league status or
points - it was about pride and hon-
our and all the things that are noble
on this earth. It was also about a large
number of pints that had been staked
on the outcome but that was the fur-
thest thing from our minds as the ref
blew his whistle and the seconds
kicked off.
The game started well for the
thirds - strong challenges came from
both sides but the commitment from
the blues made it hard going for the
seconds. The pace of the game was
fast and the ball was played up and
down the field in frenzied attacks.
Ben and Simon were snorting fire
and brimstone in midfield and it was
about fifteen minutes before the sec-
onds started to fight back. With the
tide of the game turning slightly, the
thirds broke from defence with a
strong run through the middle. The
defence backed away and so the shot
came from outside the penalty box
and dipped over Steve's head into the
goal - the thirds had taken a shock
lead. The rest of the half was domi-
nated by a seemingly endless string
of corners for the seconds. At last
one of Felix's inswingers was bun-
dled into the goal by the mighty
Robo and so half-time arrived with
honours even.
Second's captain Steve was not
happy at half-time - his standing in
the club, along with numerous
drinks, were on the line here. "The
Slags" needed to show that they had
the class to beat the thirds with a lit-
tle bit of intelligent play instead of
the headless chicken approach of the
first half. The thirds resolved to keep
battling and start the second half as
they had the first.
From the kick-off the seconds
started to show that they could man-
age to pass the ball. The thirds didn't
seem to be able to mount any form of
attack as the ball was pinged about
the pitch from second's red shirt to
second's red shirt. Defenders Will,
German and Loz, 21, took control
and gave the midfielders a bit of time
to play with. Slick passing down the
left from Si, Phil "the pill" and Hajo
carved out many opportunities but
staunch defending, particularly from
full-backs Tim and Jamie who,
despite struggling with ridiculous
hairstyles, ensured that the only shots
on goal were long-range efforts
which the 'keeper dealt with easily.
The pressure continued with attack
after attack being repulsed by the
thirds. Captain Dan showed what
true commitment was by blocking
one cross with his testicles. Some of
the thirds commented, perhaps cruel-
ly, that it was the first time that they
had seen him use his head this sea-
son. As the clock ran down the sec-
onds' forays became tinged with des-
peration as they knew there was not
much time left to save their reputa-
tion. Martin's bet that he would score
a hat-trick was lost, however, as the
thirds' grit and determination at the
back meant that they emerged moral
victors with a draw.
The league points were shared but
there was no doubt at who was more
pleased with the result. The seconds
will have to finish games off if they
are to be promoted this season. The
thirds' defensive fortitude will serve
them well if they can keep it up in
subsequent matches.
Sport i n brief
IC THIRDS T A K E O N R S M
The Mines played IC III and through
a mixture of a slight inability of the
RSM to finish the opportunities pro-
vided to them and some reasonable
defending from IC especially in the
second half when they seemed con-
tent with playing 5 in midfield, we
only managed to score 2 goals. The
first by Magnus in the first half the
second in the second half by Craig
(stealing the glory from Roger,
unlucky mate).We would like to
thank the opposition of IC V for pro-
viding the meal tickets for 2 of our
team.
B O A T C L U B
The boat club took a small squad to
last weekend's Walton Small Boat's
head, but still managed to win most
divisions.
The double scull of Tom Gale and
Martin Kettle were the fastest crew
of the day, beating former World
Champion Peter Haining in the
process.
Racing in a single scull, Pete
Wilson comfortably won the Senior
2 and Senior 3 divisions, whilst
Simon Dennis took the Novice
crown.
Richard Dunn and Simon Wall
had a storming row in their class, fin-
ishing within a second of Atlanta
Olympians Graham Smith and
Rupert Obholzer. Stefan Eyre and
Paul Backes were third overall.
Several other divisions were won
against notable opposition, including
the University of London, who must
by now be getting highly embar-
rassed by their inability to beat one
of their constituent colleges.
RUGBY S E C O N D S
Despite a determined and aggressive
performance, IC Seconds went down
fighting, 24-12, in a closely fought
contest with Charring Cross Seconds
(again!) Early scores for Charring
Cross only succeeded in stirring the
IC fire, with tries coming from
Darren Bryce and David Pearce, and
a conversion from Justin Lee. The
stars of this glittering performance
are too numerous to all be mentioned
- you all know who you are.
However, special credit goes to Dave
Pearce and Peachy who both starred
in unfamiliar positions.
We are now looking forward to
our grudge clash with the Firsts next
week, when we hope we can repeat
this outstanding performance.
Snooker Open "Best in living memory"
Last Sunday saw the traditional
Imperial College Christmas snooker
open. There was a shock in the first
round with the reigning champion
Jon Fulcher being beaten 2-0 in two
hard fought, close frames by Club
president Russell Towers. Russell
then proved that this was no fluke by
progressing to thefinalwith 2-1 wins
over first Alex Robinson and then
Steff Lewis, winning in dramatic
style after Steff went in-off the final
black. In the top half of the draw
Simon Baugh made it to the final,
beating Aki Pakarinen (2-0) and Tim
Dann (2-1).
The final was a close affair. The
first four frames were shared with
Russell twice coming from behind to
level at 2-2. In the deciding frame
Russell pulled away to a 35 point
lead before Simon pulled himself
back into it with some consistent
scoring and then took the lead with a
difficult 26 break. Simon eventually
secured the frame and match with the
final blue and pink. The final was
described by one of the spectators as
'the best in living memory'.
The Snooker Club now looks for-
ward to a key match at Cardiff next
weekend.
Inauspicious start for IC wrestling
The newly-formed Imperial Olympic
Wrestling Club got of to an inauspi-
cious, if predictable, start at the 1996
London Freestyle Championships on
14th December. The championships,
held at Kensington Sports Centre,
was the last major tournament of the
season, and many of the country's
top wrestlers attended. The sole IC
entrant suffered two heavy defeats
against experienced opponents,
including an ex-Hungarian national
squad member, in the Senior 82kg
division. Kensington Wrestling Club
(which the Imperial club is part of)
fared rather better, taking 3rd in the
90kg, 2nd in the 82kg and firsts in
both the 57 and 62kg Senior events,
and numerous trophies in the Junior
categories.
Frank Murrey, sports and leisure
manager at IC, presented the trophies
on the day, emphasising the hope that
wrestling will play an important role
in the life of the planned sports cen-
tre to be built under Princes Gardens.
