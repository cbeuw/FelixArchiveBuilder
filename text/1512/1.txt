THE SPECTRE OF UNEMPLOYMENT
FURTHER CONCERNS OVER HOLLAND
CLUB AND CLAYPONDS AT PANEL
Further student concern about the clo-
sure of Clayponds and the proposed
changes to the Holland Club have
been revealed at the discussion forum
on postgraduate accommodation and
social space held by the Graduate Stu-
dents’ Association (GSA) last Thurs-
day.
Clayponds Village in South Ealing
is currently the most affordable post-
graduate accommodation provided by
the College – housing 325 students in
rooms with prices starting at just over
one hundred pounds per week. The
decision to close the postgraduate hall
of residence was made in December
by the College Management Board, a
body that has no student members and
whose reports are confidential. As it
emerged at the forum, neither the cen-
tral Union nor the GSA were directly
informed of this decision. The plans
Open discussion forum sees mixed views over ongoing developments
came to light after Clayponds sub-war-
den Craig Court heard rumours about
the closure, which were later confirmed
to Union President Scott Heath. Speak-
ing to Felix the GSA President, Robert
Tang, said that he deeply regrets “the
lack of communication the GSA re-
ceives regarding the College decisions
on the closure of Clayponds”.
According to Tang, should Claypo-
nds close the cheapest accommoda-
tion the College would be offering to
postgraduates next year “would be en-
suite rooms at Orient House, at around
£199 per week”. Heath estimates that,
including travel, the living costs per
month at Orient House are £200 more
expensive than the £600 per month
at Clayponds. Rent at the newly con-
structed Griffon Studios in Battersea
starts at £235 per week. The College
is planning to open new postgradu-
ate accommodation, Imperial West,
Earlier this month undergraduates of
Selwyn College at the University of
Cambridge voted to send a letter to the
Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, in
light of his views on gay marriage. In
an extensive interview last month with
The Daily Telegraph about the Church,
racism and his life experiences, the
Archbishop stated a “relationship be-
tween a man and a woman – that’s mar-
riage”.
This has come about in light of the
government moving toward legalising
gay marriage in Britain. After objec-
tions were raised a public consultation
was arranged to take place in March to
discuss the topic. Archbishop Sentamu
raised his objections, affirming that it
wasn’t the role of the State to define
what marriage is. He predicts that there
will be a “rebellion” in the House of
Commons over the issue, being sure
that they already have “one hundred
MPs signing up that they’re against to
change this tradition”.
“I don’t want to redefine what I call
very clear social structures that have
been in existence for a long time and
then overnight the state believes it can
go in a particular way” commented the
Archbishop, then relating this move by
the government to be like the actions
of dictators.
The letter appeals to Archbishop
Sentamu to reconsider his comments,
questioning whether marriage today re-
ally is defined as being between a man
and a woman. They combat his likening
the government to dictators, replying,
“no new measures are being imposed
upon those heterosexual couples who
are already married or are planning to
marry in the future”.
The LGBT Officer of Selwyn Col-
lege, Lewis Bartlett, explained that
