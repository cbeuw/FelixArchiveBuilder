Wednesday afternoon saw the latest
chapter in Imperial College Fencing
Club’s stellar season unfold. The men’s
first team kicked off proceedings in
Ethos at 2pm, facing a Durham side who
turned up with minutes to spare before
the scheduled 2pm start. Confidence
was high amongst the guys, having been
freshly crowned Southern Premiership
champions and only having suffered one
defeat all season. Durham, on the other
hand, sat at the bottom of the Northern
premiership, having lost all their league
matches this season.
The Imperial team had undergone
a few changes from the team that won
the league in late January; president
Ed Collier and top sabreurs Maiyuran
Ratneswaran and Henry Gann were
unavailable. They were replaced by Ca-
mille van Hoffelen and Chris Lawrence.
They completed the squad made up of
Chris Gilliam, Indy Leclercq and Glen
Ostacchini in foil; Jonathan Ashcroft,
Tom Powell and Harry Gulliver in the
epee and Dider Nohlmans, captain, in
the sabre.
After a bit of a delayed start (due to
some excessively long warming up by
the opponents) the first bout of the day
got underway in the foil. Ostacchini
made a fine start, which was then contin-
ued somewhat shakily by Leclercq and
then confirmed by Gilliam in the third
relay. The foilists found their groove,
and when the ninth and final bout came
around, they were a massive 36 points
ahead. Ostacchini dispatched the oppos-
ing anchor (an epeeist) in style, to finish
the match with a score of 45-14 and a
very encouraging lead for the sabreurs
to build on.
Technically, the sabre team fielded
against Durham would count as a ‘B’
team, although this was by no means ev-
ident in the cold, calculating demolition
of the opposing team. The hits flowed
thick and fast, and in a mere twenty
minutes or so the match was done and
dusted. One could almost pity the Dur-
hamites, having traveled so far to lose so
