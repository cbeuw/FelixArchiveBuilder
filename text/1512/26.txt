Ever since its rebirth in 2002, Top Gear has
provided me with Sunday night entertain-
ment and it’s always been brilliant. Well
actually that isn’t entirely true. You see, Top
Gear’s entertainment value has decreased
hugely in recent years – the ‘humour’ has be-
come entirely predictable and largely infan-
tile, whilst fewer and fewer cars are actually
being reviewed and much like I expect Hang-
man to be offensive, I expect a car show to
be about cars.
In the last two or three years the balance
has been completely wrong – it’s been three
idiots larking about doing pointless chal-
lenges and occasionally reviewing a car if
the mood takes them. My primary reason for
tuning in to Top Gear each week is to see the
car reviews and tests, I don’t think to myself
‘oh I want to watch some comedy – I’ll watch
Top Gear!’
You can imagine then that it was to my de-
light that the first episode of the current se-
ries (number 18 if you were wondering) was
fantastic (excepting will.i.am as the guest; he
was a bit boring). The three lads went on a
road trip through Italy in a Lamborghini, a
McLaren and a Noble – what more could you
want. This was – as the case usually is with
Top Gear – beautifully filmed and produced.
Fantastic. Top Gear is back.
I was even happier when the second
episode was also up to (if not exceeding)
scratch. It saw a genuinely interesting feature
in which Richard Hammond explored the
world of NASCAR, a sport which is rarely
mentioned here in Blighty followed by Jer-
emy reviewing the new Mercedes-Benz SLS
AMG Roadster. Even what I usually find the
most tedious part of the show, the Star in a
Reasonably Priced Car, was genuinely amus-
A return to form
for Top Gear?

ing and interesting although I guess that’s
what you’d expect from Matt LeBlanc. The
episode ended with a feature in which Jeremy
and James investigated the growing Chinese
car market, most of which are cheap copies
of European marques. Even that was interest-
ing and not too infantile for my liking.
Episode three was not like the first two
episodes. Episode three was what you’d
describe as terrible. After watching it I felt
more annoyed than someone with no sense
of humour reading Hangman. James
reviewed a Vauxhall Corsa VXR and
a Fiat Panda, whilst Clarkson and
Hammond wasted time trying to
direct a car chase for a remake of
The Sweeney.
It was a mixed bag with epi-
sode four – it started well with
James traveling to Florida to
review the Fisker Karma – a
surprisingly good looking and
well made electric car. He did of
course end up going off track and
meeting AC/DC frontman Brian John-
son to drive his 1928 Bentley. Although
that was no bad thing as the Bentley is a
beautiful piece of craftsmanship and de-
sign. Following this Jeremy reviewed the
Ferrari FF and Bentley Continental GT
on ice in Northern Sweden which made
for surprisingly good viewing. The final
feature of the episode involved the trio
each making off road mobility scooters
and testing them against commercially
available versions. It was neither inter-
esting nor funny. All it managed to do
was ruin what was a pretty decent epi-
sode.
So has Top Gear returned to form? No.
Not yet. It’s certainly the best its been
for a few years, but I still find myself
debating whether it’s worth my time or
not. It’s almost as if it’s going through a
mid life crisis. It needs a new lease of life
– a breath of fresh air. To me Top Gear
should be a showcase for the mechanical
excellence and beauty of new cars whilst
providing an arena in which to promote the
joy of driving, not some cringeworthy child-
ish ‘entertainment’ show.
Some say he heads the New Clubs Committee...
Others say he’s running for Union President...
All we know is... he isn’t Hangman.
