Fashion Week frenzy
London Fashion Week isn’t just for the editors and bloggers, Alice Yang shows you how to get involved
To Do: London Fashion Weekend
Once again Somerset House has
opened its doors to the great Brit-
ish public, inviting in all those
among us that yearn for the fash-
ion week experience. The hoards
of models, photographers and edi-
tors that have swarmed London this
past week with street style inspira-
tions to last us all season may al-
ready be sprinkling their magic on
Paris; but for us casual Londoners,
London Fashion Weekend is where
it all begins.
Taking place in the official LFW
show space, LFWeekend offers you
the chance to perch on the benches
where fashion’s elite were sat just
23–26 February, Tickets start at £12.50
hours before, scribbling away in
their Smythson diaries and franti-
cally tapping away at their Stella
McCartney cased iPads. After days
of sitting at your laptop gasping at
next winter’s designs, you too can
have your turn at being inspired and
enlightened from the front row –
and by the more relevantly coveted
spring summer trends at that.
The pristine tunnels of Somerset
House will be lined with rails of tra-
ditional British labels from Jaeger
London to Pringle of Scotland, as
well as the country’s most aspir-
ing emerging designers so you can
be first to lay your hands on Holly
Fulton’s graphic art-deco prints and
a piece of Maria Francesca Pepe’s
conceptual ‘jewellery-wear’. Oh and
did we mention that everything
would be going at a cheeky dis-
counted price?
Once you’re done shopping (albeit
restocking your entire wardrobe
with this summer’s pretty pastels),
the pampering can begin. With in-
dustry experts such as Toni & Guy
and Elizabeth Arden on hand to help
revamp your look for the upcoming
season, you can rest in the safe
knowledge that your split ends and
under-eye-bags will not be following
you out of this event. Such joyous
To Visit: International Fashion Showcase
With 19 global embassies and na-
tional cultural institutes opening its
doors to press, buyers and the pub-
lic alike, the International Fashion
Showcase promises to give an in-
sight onto the global fashion scene
like never before.
The first event of its kind in the
first ever collaboration between the
British Council and British Fashion
Council, this exhibition was created
to “honour its values of interna-
tional respect, excellence, equality
and friendship”, whilst celebrating
the Olympic year that will bring to
our capital the widest range of cul-
tures and ethnicities yet to land on
1–29 February, Free
our humbled soils. From Australia
to China, Italy, Korea, Japan, the
US, Nigeria and Romania, to name
just a few, each country is exhibit-
ing the talented emerging design-
ers they feel best encapsulate their
country’s future of fashion on our
doorsteps.
Dotted around various parts of
central London, the handy down-
loadable ‘passport’ maps out a
trail to follow for fashionistas and
cultural-lovers alike, with the added
childish element of stamp collect-
ing at each venue and a prize of
£250 to spend at next year’s LF-
Weekend for the savviest explorer.
So if you feel that following the
various fashion weeks online like
the rest of us is just a bit too main-
stream, or perhaps you just feel like
you should put more of an effort to
become culturally educated before
the Olympics kick off this summer,
the International Fashion Showcase
has it all – air miles unnecessary.
To Look Out For: Marni for H&M
A flurry of capsule collections has
taken the world by storm recently
with Karl Lagerfeld for Net-A-Porter
giving us a sharp monochromatic
style injection, and Mary Katrant-
zou for Topshop blowing us away
with her bright signature prints
and enticing lamp shade dresses.
Yet topping these has been H&M’s
impressive unrelenting storm of de-
signer collaborations, which has yet
to be concluded.
With a double blast from Donatel-
la Versace featuring first a selection
of loudly patterned and studded
pieces inspired by her own Versace
SS2012 collection, followed by a
Marni for H&M: 8 March
more wearable selection of cute
fruit-scattered crop tops and can-
dy coloured dresses, immediately
chased up by David Beckham’s un-
derwear collection (which was per-
haps just an excuse for him to show
the world he still had rock hard abs),
the Swedish clothing company is
now about to launch Marni for H&M.
Marni for H&M promises to be a
world of silky printed dreams. The
latest campaign pictures show an
eclectic yet simultaneously elegant
collection, effortlessly working the
biggest trends this season. For the
girls there are spots and stripes
clashing excitedly with colour block-
ing and floral patterns, topped off
with chunky bracelets, sweet de-
tachable collars and large petal
necklaces. Similarly for the guys,
there are some surprisingly wear-
able pieces in simple slim cuts and
luxurious fabrics – what guy doesn’t
secretly fancy a bit of silk or cash-
mere?
However, with so much going for
it and such a build up to its launch,
there is one slightly large downside
– this is a collection that may re-
quire overnight campouts, but then
again, perhaps that’s a price worth
paying for such a delectably perfect
patterned look.
thoughts makes for the perfect time
to head over to the pop-up bars and
boutiques to indulge in some of
fashion’s favourite munchies; from
Frea Frozen Yogurt to Chambord,
whilst enjoying the tracks being
spun by fashion’s favourite DJs.
Whether it’s a complete wardrobe
overhaul you want or just a chance
to feel like a front-row editor, LF-
Weekend is most definitely one not
to miss.
“The International
Fashion Showcase
has it all”
