T
he US elections are com-
ing faster than a randy
teenager whose left his
bedroom door open when
his parents are downstairs.
Much like the aforementioned situa-
tion, they are always exhilarating and
dangerous. At the moment, it’s the Re-
publican nominations that are taking up
valuable headline space. They are not
too dissimilar to an arrogant, terrible,
and loud punk-rock band: they shout
incoherently about how great they are
when all the evidence seems to sug-
gest the opposite. If I’m honest, I think
that the Republican field is incredibly
week this time around. Even John Mc-
Cain maybe thinks so: he accidentally
endorsed Obama and not Romney in
what I can only imagine was a Freudian
slip. I want to waste your time by im-
maturely discussing the potential (and
real) candidates.
This year, some wild cards have been
throwing their hats into the ring. There
was the brief period when Donald
Trump looked like he was going to run.
I can’t imagine him being the people’s
candidate, given that he is possibly the
least humble and relatable man inAmer-
ica. In fact, he’s made some statements
that are so incredibly douchey that I al-
most started assuming irony. Until, with
a sigh, I realised whom I was thinking
of. Prime example of this is when he
uttered the phrase: “Part of the beauty
of me is that I’m very rich”. Replace
“beauty” with “fundamental character-
istics” and “very rich” with “a massive
dickhead” and then the sentence be-
comes accurate. Sarah Palin threatened
to run, but, if you ask me, and I guess
you sort of unwillingly are if you’re
reading this, she prefers campaigning
and celebrity status; she doesn’t seem to
actually want to do the job, she’d rather
just complain about how others are.
Then there was Michelle Bachmann –
whose husband allegedly tried to cure
people of homosexuality. Unfortunate-
ly, he couldn’t cure himself of stupid-
ity, or his wife for that matter. If you
want to donate to the “buy a Bachmann
a brain cell” campaign, please do so by
buying me a drink in the Union.
The two front-runners, it seems, are
Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. So
far, it hasn’t been a friendly rivalry.
The gloves are so far removed from
their hands that only the Hubble tele-
scope is capable of picturing them. Of
course the attack ad is the embodiment
of this. It’s now somewhat of a tradi-
tion. One ad that particularly caught my
eye was Newt Gingrich’s attack against
Mitt Romney that built up to the shock-
ing truth: “and just like John Kerry…
he speaks French”. First of all, this is
confusing an ability that could only im-
prove foreign relations with something
that is a hindrance. Secondly, and im-
portantly, the footage of Mitt Romney
‘speaking French’ consists of Romney
saying: “Bonjour, je m’appelle Mitt
Romney”. He’s not exactly discussing
philosophy at the Sorbonne now is he?
With my extremely limited capability
at French (my family will fully back
me up on this) I think I could possibly
manage that – and this is coming from
a person who got a B in GCSE French
and still thinks the only explanation is
that they wrote “U” incorrectly on the
certificate.
Romney is not exactly innocent in
this mud slinging match. On his web-
site there is a whole section of videos
titled “unreliable leader”. At first, I
thought that this was the first incidence
of someone making attack ads against
A weak Republican field
themselves. It turns out they are all ref-
erencing Gingrich.
This is just the foreplay though; the
main event is still to come. The big race
to the White House isn’t in full swing
yet (we would all definitely know if it
had as it would be impossible to miss).
There’s one issue that continues to bug
me about the US electoral system, be-
sides some of the candidates. It’s the
small point of how the votes are counted
and how the election result is decided. I
can understand why you would have a
Senate and a House in which each state
locally elects someone to go and sit for
them. (Although, I should hasten to
note, there is still the argument that it
shouldn’t be this way and that propor-
tional representation is a better system,
but that’s a different debate.) However,
I cannot understand why, when elect-
ing the President, they have the points
system whereby each state has differ-
ent points and everything’s muddled
and weird. It basically ends up meaning
someone in one state will have a more
important say than someone in another
state. Why not have it just as whoever
gets the most votes wins? That’s simple
and democratic. When I think of the
system they have in place, I feel like
I’m in a lecture where some maths is
involved: I understand the how, but the
why is still a bit of a mystery. In fact,
that’s sometimes the feeling I get when
I think about how any politicians got
into their positions of power.
Have Newt
and Mitt
unfairly made
an attack
ad about
your hidden
talent? Tell

Nah dude I swear it’s THIIIIS big. As if your policy is that all encompassing
This year’s Summer Ball is set to see all
the fun of the fair, figuratively and finan-
cially, following the wise and not entirely
unexpected decision to revert to a more
traditional event than last year.
Deputy President (Finance & Services)
Michael Foster announced the latest
plans (to bring back a black tie dress
code and the option of a sit down formal
dinner) at a meeting of Imperial College
Union Council on Monday 13 February.
The event is set to be held on Saturday
23 June. A preliminary budget has been
approved, the current plan will be taken
to the Finance & Risk Sub-Committee
of the Union’s Trustee Board, and any
changes will be reviewed by the Union’s
Executive Committee. Steps are clearly
being taken to ensure that the event is
less susceptible to financial risk and
loss.
The paper suggested that students
should be involved “at all levels”. The aim
of this appears to be to gain the atten-
tion, and raise the expectations, of the
student body, in addition with increasing
the transparency of the event itself. Cur-
rently, it appears to be working. Other
than speculation over budget changes
and an increase to proposed ticket pric-
es (between £25 and £30 for entertain-
ments only and between £5 and £7 for
the after party) immediate feedback to
the plans has been positive.
This is sensible, and in ways inevita-
ble. Taking a risk on this year’s Summer
Ball would have been wholly illogical. The
debate and conversation that emerged
after the controversial decision to have
last year’s Summer Ball take the format
of a festival with no compulsory formal-
wear was widespread. Any risk of foster-
ing further discontent is something that
ideally must be quashed.
At this moment in time, and with no
fully concrete plans in place, it is hard
to argue about what potential improve-
ments could be made. That is to say, shy
of an open bar (it has, after all, been a
long time since the heady days of a £1
pint). Some have suggested one main
headliner to cut down on the cost of vari-
ous artists across stages, though two
main acts on two stages with support
is also a decent choice. The decision to
take a more reserved standpoint on the
running of this year’s event is for all in-
tents and purposes, following last year,
far wiser than persisting with something
that breaks drastically from tradition.
Crowdpleasing is the name of the
game all around. There is still some time
until the main event, but the signs look
promising. Tentative, but promising.
