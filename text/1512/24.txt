A cop with the nickname “Date Rape”
(Harrelson) is not going to be a mild-
tempered, even-minded, fair cop; al-
though it probably wouldn’t be fair to
say that he is a bad person. He believes
in the justice system, he has respect for
the police force and the work they do, he
is passionate about arresting the scums
of L.A., and he appears to be a family
man with two children he is dedicated
in taking care of. For him, slightly
bending and sometimes outright break-
ing the law is absolutely fine, as long as
he has a justifiable goal. He is the kind
of cop who would beat someone half
to death to get some vital information.
Cops could get away with this kind of
mindset but in the 1990’s, the infamous
Rampart scandal was shaking up the
L.A. police department, with corrupt
cops being discharged and attracting
a lot of embarrassment and negative
press attention to the police force.
Caught in the middle of this chaos is
the equally chaotic and volatile Brown,
whose stubborn, crime-fighting nature
refuses to tone down despite the scru-
tiny his occupation is under. One day
he chases and beats up a man who acci-
dentally crashed into his car and tried to
flee, and his rampage with his police ba-
ton ends up getting caught on a civilian
camera. The video and his name are all
across the evening news later that day,
and attracts even more protest, some-
thing his powerful bosses, trying their
absolute best to survive the aftermath of
the Rampart scandal, are furious about.
His professional life is therefore in
jeopardy, with Internal Affairs (Weav-
er, Buscemi) wanting to bury this case
from the public by getting rid of Brown
as swiftly as possible.
Things at home aren’t much bet-
ter. The two women (Heche, Nixon),
who happen to be sisters, who Brown
each fathered a daughter with, have
kicked him out of their house and he is
not a welcome member at their dinner
table, despite his desire to bond with
this daughters (who are incidentally,
both cousins and sisters). His domes-
tic life consists of lazing around his
couch, watching television, drinking
beer and endlessly smoking. He needs
his job more than ever to remain sane

and have some sort of purpose in life.
Being targeted as a sacrificial lamb by
his employees at this point in his life is
even less welcoming, and Brown is not
willing to go down without a fight. A
legal battle ensues in which he tries to
not only clear his name, but also keep
his job.
But luck is most certainly not on his
side. Even when he is trying to lay low
and correct some of the mistakes he has
made, he somehow ends up making his
situation worse, with his life further
spiraling out of control. Brown may
not be a likable character at first, due
to his shockingly impulsive and violent
behaviour, and the fact that very little
is told about him prior to a lot of these
hectic events also don’t help the audi-
ence trying to understand this man. But
the superb Harrelson is able to do won-
ders with his surprisingly underwritten
main character. A highly underrated ac-
tor who sails through different genres
with competence and ease, the versatile
Harrelson is a tour-de-force in captur-
ing Brown’s hardships and his daily
intimate struggle to please everyone
around him.
Despite the fiery nature of its plot,
Rampart chooses to linger in many long
takes and carefully observe Brown’s ev-
ery single thought and movement. This,
combined with Harrelson’s intense per-
formance, is an exceptional character
study that truly draws you in to this fas-
cinating tale of someone hitting rock-
bottom. Just as you thought it could not
get any worse for Brown, it does, in the
most unfortunate way imaginable, and
we start to wonder whether his life will
ever turn around. Although it would be
fair to assume that he himself played
a part in this mess, given all the tough
hoops he is required to jump through,
we begin to wonder if the punishment
fits the crime.
It doesn’t have much else to tell out-
side the central character’s plot which
in itself is also greatly restrained, and
because of this, the talented range of
supporting actors are merely treated as
nothing but slightly long cameo roles.
Weaver and Buscemi shine in their brief
scene they share with Harrelson, Heche
and Nixon are both suitably cranky and
dissatisfied with their children’s father’s
irresponsible string of actions. Robin
Wright has an interesting role as a mys-
terious lawyer who might or might not
be after Brown. But the real star here
is Harrelson, playing a conflicted man
in a complicated movie, in a raw, brave
performance with a touch of priceless
dark comedy here and there that shows
Harrelson yet again on top form.
Enjoying a nice cup of coffee - a luxury most actors can’t afford on set but...to heck with it, I’m Woody Harrelson!
