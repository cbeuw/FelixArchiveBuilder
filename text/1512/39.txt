FELIX Friday 24 February 2012 39
harshly. Final score: 45-9 for Imperial.
Mind-boggling.
For those of you astute with numbers
(I would say most of you, but I wouldn’t
like to stereotype) you will have no-
ticed that the match was already won
by this point; even if Durham won the
epee 45-0 Imperial would still prevail
on points (and weapons). The mere
suggestion of this was scoffed at by the
epeeists, though, with the motivation to
win all the more fired up by the victo-
ries of their squadmates. The match was
a much tighter affair than the two pre-
vious weapons, with Durham leading
for most of the way. This was not un-
expected: the Northeners’ strong point
was known to be the epee, which was
why the team was relieved to have put
the match away beforehand. IC were
three or four hits down going into the
final bout, and some valiant fencing by
Gulliver saw the match go down to the
wire, with Durham eventually taking it
45-43. It was smiles all around as the
men fulfilled the expectations and quali-
fied themselves for the semi-finals, to be
held at Sheffield.
Not long after the guys vacated the
piste, it was the Women’s turn to don
their kit and make sure they were going
to be joining the guys in Sheffield. The
team of Hannah Bryars, Alice Mitchell,
Emily Bottle, Jing Quek. Zoe Robinson
and captain Charlotte Levin were ready
for a Bristol team currently in a division
below them, the Western 1A. Given that
the girls were current southern premier-
ship champions and undefeated all sea-
son, the match promised to be straight-
forward
Starting with the epee, the girls fought
valiantly although the Bristol team
proved to be too strong for Mitchell,
Bottle and Levin. They posted the re-
spectable score of a 29-45 loss, leaving it
to the sabreurs and the foilists to win the
match. Up next, indeed, was the sabre –
fenced by Jing Quek, Bryars and Rob-
inson. This was an IC-dominated affair,
with the girls posting a comfortable win:
45-19. Now 10 points ahead, they were
perfectly poised for the win, finishing
with their strongest weapon, foil. Led
by Sports scholarship athlete Bryars, the
foilists went one better on the sabreurs
and posted a large victory of 45-13, leav-
ing no chance to the Bristol girls. Tenth
match, tenth victory of the season for the
seemingly unstoppable Imperial College
Fencing Women’s first team.
The serious stuff is now to come, in
three weeks time. Both teams will be
heading up the M1 to the English Insti-
tute of Sport in Sheffield, where BUCS
is holding a huge, multisport event for
the finals of various cups and champi-
onships. The men are set to face Cam-
bridge in the semi-finals, and the women
are up against Durham. If everything
goes well, the day continues with the fi-
nal, and possibly being crowned BUCS
champions for the second year running.
En Garde!
