COMMENT
A
re women unhappy
at Imperial? Some, it
seems, are. Some men
are too. Whether these
are vocal fractions of a
silent majority, or simply a vocal mi-
nority remains to be seen, but it doesn’t
really matter. Every student at Imperial
deserves freedom to be him/herself and
to thrive to his/her full potential, minor-
ity or not – and women at Imperial are
a minority. Within the central Union we
do a lot of work for many of the rec-
ognised minorities but have done little
recently for women.
Historically we have had a women’s
officer, women’s society, and a women
only social space, but as time wore on
and gender parity drew ever nearer,
work on women’s rights fell by the
wayside, replaced by newer, fresher
campaigns. Perhaps we stopped fight-
ing for gender equality because we
thought the battle was won, or perhaps
members of the Union became con-
vinced that the stereotypical burning-
bra-brandishing brand of feminism
could gain little traction at Imperial and
thus discarded it, failing to replace it
with an equally passionate but different
coloured effort through oversight. Ei-
ther way, the Union slowly let the femi-
nist narrative slip further and further
down the agenda. I imagine it is easy
to become complacent and to believe
that women are represented and catered
for when Women in Science Engineer-

ing and Technology (WSET), winners
of President’s Award in 2010, are so
blazingly successful in their every en-
deavour, forgetting that WSET in fact
has defined a very narrow if extremely
valid scope of operation for itself and
never endeavoured to address many
of the issues that affect many women
daily. As a result we now have no femi-
nine voice on campus. Traditionally this
voice would have found itself through,
first the Women’s Officer and then the
Gender Equalities officer. For whatever
reason, this mechanism is not currently
effective, as recent articles in Felix have
brought to blinding light.
We recently gained access to the data
from the Student Experience Survey
carried out in October. On first glance
it appears that 10.2% (382/3763) of un-
dergrads, 3.5% (28/792) of PG-Taught
and 7.9% (21/267) of PG-Research
students answered ‘Yes’ to ‘Do you
feel [your gender has] affected the
quality of your experience at Imperial
negatively?’. There are many ways this
could be interpreted as we do not yet
know whether it was women or men
who felt their experience had been com-
promised; but for now, all we can say
(and rest assured the breakdowns will
be shared as soon as we have them) is
that 10% of undergraduate students feel
their experience has been negatively af-
fected by their gender – and this is un-
acceptable. The College is taking this
very seriously.
I
recently joined the twenty-first
century and got a new phone.
Actually, that’s not quite ac-
curate. As well as servicing my
telecommunicative needs, it also
has a whole array of shiny doodads
and gizmos. It has a camera with the
resolution to individually identify the
hairs in Karl Marx’s beard from across
a crowded dinner party. Its GPS is so
precise it even knows when I’m stand-
ing on one leg in the middle of the Sa-
hara (sadly though, not in Fulham for
some reason). It is capable of posting to
Facebook and Twitter so I don’t have to
be near a computer to be vain or inane
anymore. On top of this, it has a veri-
table host of apps, each more pointless
than the last. I can even phone people
with it... though I haven’t quite worked
out how yet.
I am amazed that what would have
been a supercomputer thirty years ago
can now nestle down in my trousers.
Although it makes for a rather dubious
chat-up line, I had resisted the electro-
magnetic pull of new technology up
until this point. Admittedly, this new
device throws off enough energy to
give me leg cancer even when it’s in my
other trousers, but my main reason to
coyly refuse previous techno-advances
was my belief that a phone should be a
phone and just that.
This fear of the future, of change, of
the unfamiliar, is only so cliché because
it is so ancient. Scrape away all the gad-
gets and pretty colours and the scene
hasn’t changed much since pre-history,
when a prognathic ancestor of Steve
Jobs brought tablets back to the cave.
His friends must have looked at him as
if he’d been at the red berries.
“Look, friends! The age of the tablet
has arrived.”
“But what does it do?” (Thousands of
years on, and this conversation proves
that history does indeed repeat itself)
“Before you could only etch your pre-
expressionist imaginings on the cave
wall but this is a piece of wall you can
take with you. You can show all your
friends!”
“But all my friends are in the cave!”
“This is for when they’re not!”
Impressed awe all around as people
came around to the idea of mobile com-
munications. Words came later, much
more gradually, as people got worse at
drawing and their scribbles looked less
and less like what they were supposed
to. Compare Egyptian hieroglyphs with
Greek lettering, and look at what passes
for the Greek constellations – Egyptian
constellations were the ancient equiva-
lent of a Flickr album.
Although impressionism waned, in-
novation soared as the scroll was intro-
duced. Thus, the ancient world learned
that things didn’t have to weigh four
tonnes and need a wheelbarrow to move
– aesthetics, ergonomics, and compact-
ness – a lesson we only remembered
in the nineties. A few hundred years
later and the book appeared, shortly fol-
lowed by the bookmark, a quantum leap
in user interface.

The Union has a duty to ensure all
students it represents have freedom
of speech and freedom from harm. If
students do not feel comfortable ex-
pressing feminist (or any) perspectives,
something has gone very wrong. If
women do not feel represented and sup-
ported in our current system, something
has gone very wrong. It is difficult for a
student who does not feel empowered
to develop into everything he/she can
be, and that is what the Union is here to
help achieve.
I’m not sure what direction this de-
bate is going to take; indeed as an
elected representative it isn’t my place
to make executive decisions but to col-

lect views and act upon them. We may
end up with a feminist society, a gender
equality society, a women’s officer, a
regular forum facilitated by the Gen-
der Equalities Officer, who is here to
be the mouthpiece on these issues, or
something entirely new. To work out
where to go next we will be co-hosting
a forum with those who have recently
voiced opinions for all those interested
in gender issues two weeks from now –
please attend if you have any views you
would like to be considered.
In the meantime if anyone would
like to share any thoughts on this issue
please feel free to comment or email me

thereabouts, we got ourselves in a
slight muddle. The inventions of the
telephone, the radio, and the television
all rolled back the frontiers of speed,
reach, and media of our communica-
tion, but we simultaneously forgot that
things could be small as well as cool.
We’ve spent most of the past hundred
years getting back to the comfortable
customer experience the book offered,
before spending the last ten trying to
cram as many different devices onto a
single block of silicon.
This brings us right up to now, with
burn-marks on my trousers and childish
delight in my eyes. Who knows where
we’ll go from here? Since Steve Jobs
has declared that the age of the tablet
PC is here – and received the reply,
what does it do? – I think the march of
technology is cyclical, or at least a bell-
shaped curve.
Which means we’ll soon be able to
watch videos, read books, take photos,
preen our ego, and even make calls on
the iPanel – coming to a wall near you!
