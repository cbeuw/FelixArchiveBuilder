A cloud of mystery seems
to be surrounding the petty
larceny perpetrated at the
student houses during the
summer vacation. I cannot
fix the date better than that
since nobody seems able to
tell me exactly.
I first went to Dave Harris,
the warden of the houses,
who said he could do little
more than refer me to the do-
mestic bursary Mr. Seaford.
There I was told that ap-
parently only blankets had
been stolen (the thieves broke
through six doors to get to
them according to Mr. Sea-
ford but that the insurance
covered their cost anyway.
Once again however I was
referred on — the Security
Office this time. They could
add nothing and went on to
say that nobody ever told
them anything anyway. Na-
turally I was sent on to the
student house caretaker but I
haven't found him yet.
There's little more to say
except that one of the above
mentioned (I can't remember
who now) murmured some-
thing about not being able to
say exactly what was stolen
until all furniture, blankets,
etc., had been distributed to
the occupants and until they
in turn complained about that
which they lacked. Which
reminds me, I haven't un
packed my furniture yet. . .

There seems to be some
doubt about the capability of
the College's projected new
computer system to handle the
expected increase in computer
time that will be needed in the
early '70s. At present the
College has an I B M 7094
which is on loan from the
makers until November 1969.
By that time the College will
have a C D C 1700 link to
London University's C D C
6600. Some of the computer
staff have serious doubts if
this will be sufficient for the
College's future needs even if
it has 60 per cent of the avail-
able time. Should these fears
prove well founded another
CDC 1700 may prove neces-
sary, though even the most
pessimistic would admit that
a wait and see policy " is
best, as such a system had
never been employed before.

Linstead Hall is at last open. A t the beginning of July
people started to move in and immediately they began to
discover that things were not running too well Most of
what was wrong seems to have been caused by carelessness
in finish. One room was flooded when a tap became sepa-
rated from the pipe and the showers seem to be tempera-
mental. r
Linstead Hall
Complaints
These small things are usu-
ally encountered in a building
of the size of Linstead Hall.
None of the complaints put
in the complaints book have
been of a major nature. The
budget for the furnishing was
£150 per room compared with
£185 (or thereabouts) in
Southside several years ago,
so the rooms may appear a
little spartan in comparison.
Generally the finish in the
£300,000 building is better
than in Southside so when the
towel rails eventually arrive
the residents will have little
to complain about.
Wardens View
The warden, Mr. Paul
Minton, says that such things
as stiff locks and loose doors
are things that one has to put
up with in such a relatively
underinspected thing as a
building. In a Viscount aero-
plane, the lock in the lavatory
door costs £35; if such locks
were fitted all over Linstead,
there would have been little
money left for furniture, so
one has to put up with teeth-
ing problems instead. On the
whole, he is quite happy
about his new domain, but
wants to wait till Christmas
before forming a firm opinion.
DARTS
After having so much suc-
cess with his darts competi-
tion last year, Gus will be
holding another darts com-
petition this term in the
Union Bar for the Fremlin's
Silver Tankard. A l l bud-
ding darts players should not
miss this event. Gus will also
be holding competitions for
the bar race trophy.
