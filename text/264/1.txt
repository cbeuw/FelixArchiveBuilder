The recently completed Sports Centre
SPORTS
CENTRE DELAY
The new Sports Centre on the north side of Prince's
Gardens, originally due to have been open at the beginning
of this session, has been beset by misfortune. The swimming
pool and rifle range will not be open until next Monday.
The squash courts have been beset by even more misfortune
and will not be open until the start of November.

F l o o d i n g
The cause of the delay is
principally a failure of the
controller valves of the heat-
ing system. These suddenly
gave up the ghost and the en-
gineers had to be called back
in to deal with them. During
the same outbreak of rain
that caused the chaotic flood-
ing in South-East England,
part of a sewage main was
overburdened with the flow
and pools of water appeared
on the squash courts. Conse-
quently the floors of these
have to be relaid. Mr. Ste-
phenson, Senior Warden and
chairman of the Sports Centre
Steering Committee also said
that there was trouble in se-
curing messengers, but this
would not delay the opening.
Hot A i r
When the heating plant is
functioning properly the
swimming pool will even have
hot air circulating around it.
There will be three attendants
for the pool (not all working
at the same time), under the
charge of Mr. Spooner, a
member of 1956 Olympic
water-polo team and ex-baths
superintendent at Wolver-
hampton and Llanelli.
The inside story of the
sports centre is contained in
the President's column on
Page 7.

In August the Government
(through the University Grants
Committee) put a six month
stop to all University build-
ing for which contracts have
not yet been signed.
When asked by F E L I X
about the effect this would
have on IC, Mr. M . J. Da vies,
the Secretary of the College,
said that as no major financial
projects were about to start
during this period the imme-
diate effect would not be
serious. However, he did not
know what the long-term
effect might be.
This summer, Ray Phillips,
last year's President, was ap-
pointed sub-warden of the
Student house. While this
post was not mentioned in
the report which was used as
a basis for setting up student
houses it seems a very good
idea.
The possibility of such a
post first arose out of discus-
sionsn between Mr. Minton,
then warden of Garden Hall,
and Dave Harris, the warden
of the student house. (Dave
was appointed by Ray Phil-
lips and the Rector at the be*
ginning of last session.) Gar-
den Hall had many of the dis-
cipline problems that it was
anticipated might occur in
student houses. The idea re-
ceived official approval in
February, and at about that
time a vague mention of it
was made at a Union Execu-
tive meeting.
Joint CounciI
On the 12th June, Ray was
officially appointed sub-war-
den on the recommendation
of Dave Harris with the ap-
proval of the Rector. This
was only three days after
Joint Council when it had
been decided that the war-
dens of student houses should
be approved by Council. Ray
Phillips has since said that it
never occurred to him to
mention the post of sub-war-
den, and Dave Harris seems
to regard the post as entirely
the business of the warden
and says that Council did not
seem interested in student
houses anyway. Ray now
admits that the circumstances
under which he was appoin-
ted look a little fishy, but
agrees with Dave that Coun-
cil was apathetic on the sub-
ject.
Uninformed
Rex Lowin, this year's
President, who was Welfare
Officer last year, said that he
was told that student houses
were none of his business. He
now regrets not keeping him-
self well abreast on develop-
ments on this front.
Ray describes his job more
as a senior resident, as the
only perk he gets is a slightly
better room than the other
residents. He says that his
presence is necessary because
fire regulations would other-
wise make it impossible for
Dave Harris and his wife to
go out.

RCS Vice-President Javad "Adolf" Hashteroudian
was arrested at the last big Vietnam demostrationstm Sun-
day, July 21st, and subsequently fined £25 and given a three
months suspended sentence. The following is an account
of what happened, as told to FELIX by Hashteroudian.
He was taking part in the demonstration in Park Lane
(where a lot of damage was done by demonstrators) and was
amongst a lot of other people, some of whom were throwing
stones at policemen. When the police charged he was writing
poetry and did not run off when the rest did. He was
arrested for allegedly throwing stones at the police and the
arresting officer hit him on the back of the head with his
truncheon.
No Bail
He was then taken with the
rest of the people arrested to
West Central Police Station
and by the evening everyone
except Javad and three others
had been bailed out. His girl
friend, having guessed what
had happened, had gone
along to the police station to
bail him out but had been re-
fused. Moreover, he was told
that no-one had come.
Next day before going into
court the policeman who ar-
rested him told him that he
would not oppose bail, but
the police solicitor did oppose
it on the grounds that he
might try to leave the country
(he is Persian). He was re-
manded for nine days and
taken to Brixton prison,
where he was kept alone for
22 hours a day with an hour's
exercise and allowed two vi-
sitors each day. This appears
to be standard treatment for
all remanded prisoners.
Passport
Meanwhile Ron Bass, a
friend of Javad, had found a
solicitor, through the Nation-
al Council for Civil Liberties,
who was willing to take the
case and Dr. Stephen Rose of
the Biochemistry Department,
a well-known opponent of re-
search into chemical and bio-
logical warfare, had been
contacted and agreed to act as
surety for Hashteroudian. He
was released on bail on the
Friday upon surrendering his three years, a £25 fine and or-
passport. dered to pay ten guineas costs.
On 30th July he was re-
manded on bail again until
10th August when he was
once again remanded until 4th
September. He was told that
other charges might be
brought against him as well
as the one of assaulting a
police officer, but in fact
none were.
The day before his case
went before the Magistrate's
Court his barrister advised
him to plead guilty on the
grounds that the magistrate
would almost certainly be-
lieve the police. He agreed
to this as long as he did not
have to say anything.
Hearing
At the hearing on Septem-
ber 4th, the arresting officer
was not present in court and
another policemen read a
statement written by him.
The police claimed that
Hashteroudian had thrown a
stone which hit the policeman
on the shoulder but did not
hurt him. When the police
charged he ran off with every-
one else. The officer had his
truncheon out, Hashteroudian
turned round and appeared to
have a stone in his hand and
was about to hit him. He
ducked and aimed his trun-
cheon at Hashteroudian's
shoulder, who also ducked,
so accidentally being hit on
the back of the head.
Javad's barrister told the
court that he had a good
character and a good record
as a student and was sorry.
He was given a sentence of
three months, suspended for
