The usual start of session vacancies in top Union posts
have not failed to appear this year. For the second year
running RCS has no President, although as the situation
Was caused this time by the withdrawal of both candidates
for the post last summer—in the event neither has returned
to College—the Union was able to appoint Jen Warren acting
President. Nomination papers go up for this post on
Saturday and will remain up for a week. So far no possible
candidates have been mentioned to F E L I X .
job it is rarely exam-wise an
asset. The last two co-
ordinators have failed their

Carnival
Probably consistently the
worst record in the Union is
that of Carnival co-ordinator.
This is the third year run-
ning that the holder of this
office has failed to return to
College; this year as a change
from the usual failure of
exams or inability to secure
a postgraduate course, she got
married. For those who do
eventually get landed with the
bUU j
ever, as last summer there
seemed to be no shortage of
people wanting the job, this
should not be too hard for the
Carnival Board to fill.
Ents
Next on the list of vacan-
cies comes the Chairman of
Ents, where Pete Nicholls has
been unable to take up his
duties due to exam failure.
Keith Guy, last year's Chair-
man, appears to be the only
person both willing and able
to carry out the job. This is
another post with a very bad
record of incumbents not ap-
pearing at the beginning of
session.
Halls Rep
In probably the most im-
portant year for a long time
with the opening of Linstead
Hall and the first two student
houses there is no Halls of
Residence Representative.

Guilds Vice-President, did

Use it to start a
bank account with
the Midland. Then
we'll very quickly
give you a cheque
book with which to
draw cash or pay
bills.
It's nice to know
your money is
absolutely safe. But a bank
account with us promises you
something more. A chance to
budget your money each term;
and the right to go to your
I bank manager for
advice — and help
— on your finances.
And while you're a
full-time student,
you won't be asked
to pay a penny in
charges, provided
you keep your
account in credit.
Give your local Midland
manager a ring—his number
is in the 'phone book—or go
and see him about opening an
account. Do it now.

not manage to obtain a course
for this year. Bob Fryer, last
year's rep, has agreed to carry
on the duties until a new one
is elected. Most likely candi-
date is Spike Bantin who is
currently living in Linstead.
External
Affairs
The fate of the External
Affairs Officer is at the time
of writing not known. If
Dave Wield does not succeed
in coming back to College
then an election will be held
for this post at the first Union
meeting of term on, 17th
October. A t this meeting
an election will also be held
to fill the vacancy as a floor
rep on Council, created by
lane Pearson's elevation to
Secretary.
F E L I X
On the home front, F E L I X
has come through the exams
almost unscathed. The only
scheduled member of this
year's staff who failed was
Dick Middleton, intended
News Editor, for whom we
respectfully request a min-
ute's silence.

The Dramatic Society
toured in Holland this vaca-
tion, taking " Roots" by
Arnold Wesker. The play,
produced by Colin Harrison,
was rehearsed in London
during the first week of Sep-
tember and had a small in-
vited audience for its final
dress rehearsal.
Encouraged by the response
of the " guinea pigs," the set,
props and costumes were
squeezed into a Ford Transit
van, except the tin bath which
had to travel on the roof, and
three people departed with it
" to Holland or Bust."
The other eighteen mem-
bers in the group travelled by
night boat into alcoholic ob-
livion . . . and Holland. The
first performance was given
at a University Graduates
Club in Eindhoven. The next
performance, at Utrecht, was
the second night of " Motion
Week," organised for new
students of the University.
We were invited to attend the
opening night of motion week,
which was a concert by the
Utrecht Symphony Orchestra.
We then moved to Rotter-
dam and, quickly adapting
the play for " theatre in the
round," gave the third per-
formance to our most friendly
and appreciative audience.
During our stay, we took over
a student club till the early
hours, where we celebrated
our successes boosted by a
bottle of " Bolo " which we
had been given.
Our last performance was
given to students of the Insti-
tute of Dramatic Art in Am-
sterdam, whose appreciation
we valued greatly. After ex-
amining the finer points of
nightlife in Amsterdam,
twenty one tired but trium-
phant students arrived home,
despite British Rail.
Our thanks are due to the
Netherlands-England Society
for arranging our stay in Hol-
land, and I would like to
thank and congratulate all
members of the party for a
very enjoyable show.

CYBERNETICS
AT I.C.A.
Probably the nearest thing to a true fusion of the Arts
and Sciences which can be seen in London at present is the
" Cybernetic Serendipity " computer art show at the Institute
of Contemporary Arts on the Mall.
The exhibition attempts to present as many artistic pos-
sibilities in today's technology as possible and has exhibits
ranging from the old harmonograph to music composed by
or with the aid of computers; from robots which can sense
one another's presence and move accordingly to " do it your-
self " patterns on a television screen produced by moving a
strong magnet near to it; from exhibits where the frequency
or intensity of sound in the vicinity affects a visual pattern to
poetry produced by computers.

on at the I C A gallery (at the
bottom of the Duke of York
steps near Piccadilly Circus)

Pendula
A fairly long (and for most
scientists tedious) explanation
of what cybernetics is appears
jttfct inside the door. Quite
why there is this preoccupation
with the cybernetic angle is
difficult to understand, as
probably only about half the
exhibits really owe anything
to cybernetics". The other ex-
hibits seem to depend on ran-
dom number generation by
computers to other random
processes, or work on the har-
monograph tyre principle
which, once it is set going . . .
just produces a predetermined
pattern, or react to external
stimuli rather than auto-
stimuli. However this is a
minor point. A more serious
criticism is the number of
harmonograph-type machines
all producing those regular
geometric patterns. True they
don't all have those two pen-
dulums rocking the table and
pen, but range over a great
range of sophistication
driven by electric motors
made by ex-I.C. student Roy
Allen, to an I B M computer
and Calcomp plotter.
Lectures
Despite these criticisms the
show is well worth visiting
whether you are more inte-
rested in seeing computers,
pretty patterns, things going
round, " art" or whether
you like pushing buttons to
see what happens. There
can have been very few art
exhibitions at which a scien-
tist can feel so at home (and
possibly even at an advan-
tage). Cybernetic, computer,
or whatever you like to call
it, art is still very much in its
infancy but it seems likely
that it will become an impor-
tant part of science and en-
gineering (and vice versa)
before long.
A series of lectures is being
given along with the exhibi-
tion on the relationship be-
tween science and art. For
