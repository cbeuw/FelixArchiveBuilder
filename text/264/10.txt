If you have a leaning towards Athletics, Badminton,
Basketball . . . down to Volley ball, in fact any sport to be
found listed in the " Blue Book " (what a misnomer!), read
on. If not, you probably won't have reached this far
anyway.
As a fresher you will by now have been given a lot of
boring good advice by hundreds of faceless people, but
something will probably have become very clear. Everyone
agrees that you should join clubs and become involved in
the Union as early as possible. What better way than to
indulge your favourite sport.at whatever, Jevel you choose ?
Recent
Successes
IC is justly proud of its
sporting record which is se-
cond to none in the University
and a lot better than many
full Universities. Last year
teams from IC won the fol-
lowing University competi-
tions :
UL Seven-a-side competition
(rugby)
U L Team Fencing Cham-
pionship (for the third suc-
cessive year)
UL Swimming Champion-
ships
UL Golf Championship
UL Winter Regatta (3 class
wins)
UL Head of River race
UL Allan Cup Regatta
UL Girls' Hockey Champion-
ship
and many other competitions
besides.
We also have three IC stu-
dents in the University of
London Olympic Eight, and
Graham Paul is fencing for
Great Britain at Mexico. The
IC clubs can be used as step-
ping stones to the University
teams although in some sports
the IC teams are as strong or
even stronger than the UL
te.ams.
Freshers'
Role
There is no reason why this
success should not continue,
but we must have the vital
support of the Freshers. It is
surprising how many freshers
make first teams almost
immediately; but it must be
emphasised again that the
range of ability catered for
is great if not extreme.
Most trials will be held dur-
ing the first week of term. To-
day, Wednesday, the Hockey
Rugby and Soccer clubs hold
their Freshers' trials at Har-
lington and free (yes FREE)
coaches leave the Union arch
from 1 p.m. onwards. For
trials in other sports see the
notice boards or the Club
secretaries and captains, or
ask in the Union bar.

Why the
Success ?
There are many reasons
why IC has been very success-
ful at sport over the years, but
excellent facilities and an an-
nual subsidy of about £5000
does help. You must have
read about or hearc of the
superb facilities at Harling-
ton, which more than offsets
the 35 minute coach ride (4/-
return). Arthur Loveday is
responsible for the mainten-
ance of the pitches there—
and does a superb job, as
does Mrs. Loveday with the
meals.
The Boat Club too, enjoy
unique facilities with their
own Club house on the
Thames at Putney. These
unique facilities even extend
to Pete's Cafe in Fulham
Palace Road.
S p o r t s
C e n t r e
Closer at hand we have the
new Sports Centre. This
comprises a swimming pool,
squash courts, rifle range and
other facilities by Cliff
Spooner (he is the big fellow
with the 1956 Olympic blazer
—claims it's genuine!).
Hyde Park is also useful
for training and ogling (in
season). All this and more
can be had for an average
annual subscription of 12/-.
Not bad, eh?

COLLEGE
MALTA
EXPEDITION
The diver gave an unmistakable sign—a single finger
drawn across the throat followed by a rapid point to an
isolated rock. Stu was an experienced diver and would not
have given this danger signal for nothing—yet nothing could
be seen. Finally, from less than two foot range, the danger
could be descerned. A scorpion fish, almost perfectly dis-
guised, was lying on the rock. Scorpeana Scrofa is described
as one of the most poisonous European fishes. Recovery,
if one is lucky enough to survive, can take up to several
months.
A Bite in Malta
Nine IC students spent two
months this summer diving
off Malta. The object of this
scientific expedition was two-
fold. To ascertain the accu-
racy with which an under-
water swimmer can tell the
direction of an underwater
sound source (i.e. Stereopho-
nic hearing underwater), and
to assemble and test some in-
flatable underwater " mini-
Houses." One of these struc-
A bire in
a bite
tures, generally known as
" Bites" is shown in the
photograph. It is filled with
breathable air and contains
a telephone link to the shore!
There is room for two divers
inside it at once and pockets
for tools and cameras. One
diver even ate his lunch there.
Spectacular
Accident
A total of three Bites were
used and on the day of the
scorpion fish, all three were
down together. Each Bite
displaced some £ of a ton,
and on the occasion when the
mooring cables broke in 130
feet of water, the sieht was
most spectacular. The sea
became so filled with small
bubbles of air that it would
not support a person's weight.
One diver fell through this
" low density water " some 20
feet before he realised quite
what had happened.
All interested newcomers to
the College are also invited
to come and visit us at our
baths training sessions. For
titties and further details see
the Club notice Board in the
Union Entrance Hall.

HENLEY
VICTORY
Heavy rain caused a flood
stream to bubble past the
start. Time: 3.30 p.rn. Day:
Saturday, July 13th, 1968
After years of near misses, an
IC four was in thefinalof the
Visitor's Cup at Henley and
for the first time since the
flood started, they had the
easier side—so there must be
no close verdict.
Won easily'
Knowing this, the IC stroke
took his crew off the start flat
out.- Slowly they drew away.
The end of the island — a
minute gone—and they had a
clear, lead;
Halfway, they had the worst
of the stream, ind still drew
away. Then it was only a
rhatter of keeping going.
Now Henley, with a heavy
stream flowing, is an exceed-
ingly long course, but with a
trophy within your grasp,
tiredness disappears, so keep
going they did. The verdict
for our first win at Henley
since the Thames Cup in
1947. was "easily." Then
the afternoon disappeared
into a kaleido^ope of pink
ties, champagne, prize medals
and more champagne.
One of several
The win at Henley was
only the last of a number of
notable successes this year.
The eight won the Southern
Universities Championship
and the U.L. " Head of the
River," three members of the
college are rowing in the
Olympics as part of the Uni-
versity of London eight, and,
in smaller boats, a coxed pair
successfully represented the
University in the British
Universities Championships.
Higher
Aims
The target now is to produce
a winning senior eight and
possibly a four which could
represent Britain in the Inter-
nationals. That needs man-
power—of which we are very
short—so we are hoping for
plenty of new recruits ana are
quite happy to teach them
from scratch.
