I.C's own John Peel writesabout
LONDON'S SUMMER
In many ways it is a pity that the long vac is stuck right
In the middle of summer when London is really quite a nice
place to be. For lovers of music of all kinds, this has been
a very good summer. For classical fans there has been the
Proms, for those who like Indian music there was a chance
to hear a series of ragas at the I C A one weekend, Ustad
Villyat Khan doing two concerts at Swiss Cottage Odeon
and another top sitarist, whose name I cannot remember, in
a free concert at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This was
a wonderful evening with a top Indian dancer for good
measure and the Raphael Gallery (why do they call those
things cartoons ?) was packed out. But thepop'music has,
for me, been the most exciting of all this summer with the
Saturday afternoon free concert in Hyde Park.
First Conceit
The first of these featured
Tyrranosaurus Rex and the
Pink Floyd. Currently riding
a wave of popularity follow-
ing John Peel's frantic plug-
ging on good old steam Radio
(they also appeared at IC's
Carnival Charity Concert in
the Albert Hall and at the
May Ball), Tyrranosaurus
Rex are a unique phenome-
non. With most of the time
just bongos and guitar their
highly individual style seems
to require a rather more inti-
mate atmosphere than that
found in the vast expanse of
Hyde Park. How long they
can stay in vogue will depend
to a large extent on how
much variation they can get
into the framework of their
style. It certainly says quite
a lot for the present scene
that such an unusual sound
can be successful on more
than just novelty value. The
Pink Floyd are another highly
individual group who are cur-

Look in at your nearest branch, and ask to see the manager.
You'll find he has plenty of experience in the vagaries of student
finance. He'll help you to open your account, and give you any
advice you may need on how to run it . . .
He'll ask you for a couple of specimen signatures and a quid or two.
Then, providing you stay in credit, your 'Student Account' will be
free of all banking charges. And you'll have made a good friend
for the rest of your student days.
B a r c l a y s B a n k Money is our business
rently enjoying commercial
(and artistic) success. Their
music seems to fall into two
categories. One is fairly nor-
mal good pop music and the
other is something which de-
fies classification. It isn't
really electronic music, which
is generally reckoned to be
music from sounds created
and manipulated by purely
electronic means, nor is it
musique concrete, which is
music created by manipulat-
ing by tape or other elec-
tronic means sounds pro-
duced by normal instruments.
Certainly it has elements of
these two in it but then their
music is not artificial in the
sense that it is produced by
splicing bits of tape together
and playing the whole at the
wrong speed, all their sounds
are produced from what ap-
pear to be quite normal
group instruments: electronic
organ, electric guitar, drums
and human voice. It seems
to be the way in which they
are played which produces
their highly distinctive sounds.
No other group that I have
heard has achieved such a
high degree of integration of
voice with instruments that
the voice becomes an instru-
ment and one can no longer
think of a piece as separated
into vocal and instrumental
passage. Excellent examples
can be found on the tracks
"Let there be more light,"
" Set the controls for the
heart of the sun " and " Sau-
cerful of secrets " from their
" Saucerful of secrets " L P
(Columbia S C X 6258) which
is the best record I have
heard this summer (one not-
able record I haven't heard
yet is the Doors new one re-
viewed in this issue).
Traffic
The second concert fea-
tured Juniors Eyes, a fast im-
proving up and coming
group, Traffic, who played
very well and seem to have
gained cohesion with the re-
turn of Davie Mason, Pretty
Things and the Action, but
as far as I was con-
cerned the stars were the
Nice who are really playing
brilliantly just now. To prove
at one and the same time that
the charts are not all that bad
but could be better if their 6^
minute masterpiece " Ameri-
ca " got into the bottom of
the top 30. Still Arthur
The West Coast group the Doors, whose style of music featured was prominent

Brown made Number 1 so
there is hope of better things.
The third concert had Ten
Years After doing one block-
busting 40 minute number
upon their return from the
States, Peter Green's Fleet-
wood Mac with their three
lead guitars were fairly good
but not brilliant, the Fairport
Convention who had just re-
turned from holiday and
sounded a bit rusty, and the
Deviants whose organ had
broken down and were awful.
Two of the shows were
compered by Roy Harper,
who besides jokirlg and sing-
ing some of his excellent
songs, brought on some folk
singers, some out of the audi-
ence, who held their own
with all but the best of the
groups.
Albert Hall
The idea of these free con-
certs was imported from San
Francisco, where they are a
regular feature. All credit to
Blackh'l! enterprises who or-
ganised them, the Ministry of
Work who allowed them and
of course the groups who
played.
Recordwise, apart from the
aforementioned, " The Rock
Machine Turns You O n "
(CBS PR22) (by assorted ar-
tists including Bob Dylan,
Leonard Cohen, Moby Grape,
The Byrds, Simon and Gar-
funkel, Roy Harper and Tim
Rose) has some excellent
tracks (and some rubbishy
ones) and is remarkable value
at only 15/- for 15 tracks.
The Arthur Brown L P has
been well worth waiting for
and gets across the unique at-
mosphere which exists when
the Crazy World perform,
probably as well as is possible
on a record.

The Doors are an American group, well known in
the States, and beginning to be heard at large in this country,
especially since their recent visit.
. Interest in the group usually centres on singer Jim
Morrison, whose work has been described as poetry, and
whose stage performance has been branded as obscene.
Police departments seem to emphasise the latter view, and
being bust by the cops is almost a regular part of their
shows in the U.S.
This kind of thing shows in their songs; while the
lyrics are occasionally rather obtuse, the songs are full
of vigour and passion. " They've got the guns, but we've
got the numbers," says "Five to One," one of the tracks.
The album also features the Doors' current single " Hello
I love you," and " The Unknown Soldier." I found "Spanish
Caravan " and " Yes the river knows " very_ pleasant, and
I especially liked '*Not to touch the earth."
The Doors require a lot of listening to, partly because
the lyrics are important, and also because much of the
music seems to sound alike at first. Actually to enjoy them
takes an effort. It can be worthwhile.

T h e Graduate
Coming to London after the vacation, you will maybe
wish to catch up on the films which have opened since last
June. One that should be high on your list is " The
Graduate." The film concerns Benjamin, the graduate, who,
following a party given in his honour by his parents, is
seduced by Mrs. Robinson, a family friend. This becomes a
habit, broken only when Ben falls for Miss Robinson. In
the ensuing confusion we are treated to some very nice
film of Ben chasing round Berkeley and across the Golden
Gate, after his girl.
Such a theme could easily turn " The Graduate " into a
turgid mess, but under the direction of Mike Nichols we are
given a very moving and sensitive film. It is also extremely
funny. Anne Bancroft is superb as the icy Mrs. Robinson,
and newcomers Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross are as
good as the other leading parts. Music by Simon and Gar-
funkle gilds the lily: this is a most enjoyable film.
