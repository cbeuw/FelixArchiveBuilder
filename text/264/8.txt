O.S.S. IN
LABOUR
The Organisation for Social Service work parties is
tailor made for anyone in the college who enjoys spending
some of their weekends decorating, renovating or even win-
dow cleaning from time to time! Work parties are prob-
ably the most widely known aspect of O.S.S. Many more
students participate in these than the other vital but less
publicised sides of O.S.S.
The bulk of the jobs under-
taken in work parties involve
interior decorating. Often
we spend a weekend com-
pletely redecorating one or
two rooms for elderly or dis-
abled people who^ cannot
afford professional help and
who certainly cannot manage
to do the job themselves. The
work is rarely completely
straightforward as the major-
ity of places visited were
hardly built yesterday ! We
often have to contend with
crumbling plaster, rotten wood
damp and peculiarly shaped
rooms. But there is some
satisfaction to be gained in
turning an often cheerless
dwelling into a more colour-
ful, pleasant home; with
quite a few people mucking
in, the transformation can
usually be done in a weekend.
For budding " do-it-your-
self ' students there is al-
ways plenty of practice here
in plastering, painting, wall-
paper hanging and general
renovating. Other indoor
iobs include decorating large
houses taken over by local
charitable organisations to
prepare them for homeless
families.
POP IN
Attendance at work parties
can be regular or sporadic,
exactly as you please. Often
people only pop in for a
couple of hours on a a Satur-
day or Sunday while others
spend both days on the job.
However long anyone spends,
they are always only too wel-
come. In this connection, de-
tails of our activities go up
early each week (the notice
board is just outside the lower
refectory on the same side as
the gent's toilet!)
Outside jobs in the past
have mainly been in con-
nection with the Notting
Hill Adventure Playground
where O.S.S. helped in the
construction of a large re-
hearsal hut for the amazing
" Steel Band." This involved
very careful planning and
some quite heavy work over
many weekends, as well as
playing football with the local
kids at the playground. A l l
the experience gained can
come in very handy in later
life, though experience itself,
although welcome, is not ne-
cesary on our jobs. After all,
anybody can put up wall-
paper and bang in a few nails
here and there.
BIZARRE
Among other more bizarre
jobs, we have spent a week-
end at the Golborne Road
Rehabilitation Centre being
helped and hindered by the
ex-convict occupants in reno-
vating their vast dormitory.
Also, when the floor of a pre-
school play-group hut in
NorthKensington collapsed in
the winter, we helped relay
the floor in remarkably damp
weather conditions which, pe-
culiarly enough, quite added
to the occasion.
Many, if not the majority,
of weekends are run in con-
junction with Bedford Col-
lege, which tends to supply
rather more lady decorators
than I.C.
If you are interested, why
not sign on for our first week-
end on October 5/6, for de-
tails see Southside notice
board. Also our Freshers'
Evening on Friday 4th. Octo-
ber in the Upper Union
Lounge at 19.00.
DAVE CHANT
HOUSY-LOUSY
The " Entryphone " is indeed a wondrous invention.
With this electric butler, it is possible for visitors to com-
municate by word of mouth with beings in any part of the
building in which it is installed and be allowed access to the
interior of said building by the contacted host. A l l this at
the pressing of two buttons.
When I was faced with this simple task, I was standing,
surrounded by suitcases, in the porch of 55 Evelyn Gardens
—my student house, home for the next session.
I pressed the button marked " Warden " then a second
time and once more for (fabled) " luck ". The Warden
being out, I commenced to press random buttons in the fool-
ish belief that I would make contact with persons inside.
Nothing. I was greatly relieved when a smart, smiling young
fellow bounded up to the door and let me in with the words
"Hello, I'm sub-warden Ray Phillips and I've been moving
furniture," Strange!
BE
UNPREPARED
He led me through plaster
spattered corridors and peri-
lous unlit staircases of exten-
sive gradient to the base-
ment of the building where
he showed me a splendid
room. Unbelievably vast,
it boasted central heating, an
adjoining room with new
electric cooker and wall
heater and, to cap it all, it was
completely U N F U R N I S H E D
with the latest open plan
styling.
" Yes," he said " I'm sor-
ry about the cooker, it was
put there by mistake but
we'll soon remove it for you."
Grief!
" A h well," quoth he " I
must leave you now, some
fool's messing about with the
Entryphone."
The structure of the stu-
dent house could well be
described as a " Garden Hall
with knobs on," i.e. diverse
and multi-directional. Some-
one also had the clever idea
of putting the warden's flat
in the middle of the building.
Thus, to reach the upper floor
of the central building it is
necessary either to cut
through to the outer stair-
cases and climb past this or
have the embarrassment of
getting a chance view of the
personal life of " The Guv-
nor." But seriously, folks,
most walls are (as you can
now imagine) unpainted or
bear remnants of the previ-
ous occupants paint
DO IT
YOURSELF
When I eventually got an-
other room with things as use-
ful as beds in, I found the
whole furniture system to be
do-it-yourself. You make
your own beds (with your own
sheets) and you sweep your
own floors. Who knows, per-
haps you paint your own
wall (with your own brushes,
naturally).
By the way, at the time this
issue went to press, my allot-
ted room had the furniture I
was to be using in, but it had
to be unwrapped first.
