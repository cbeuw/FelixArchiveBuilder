" A l e t t e r to be sent i n p e t i t i o n form to the Department of
Education and Science i n c o r p o r a t i n g a motion passed at the l a s t I . C . U .
Meeting l a s t year."
We are i n s t r u c t e d to b r i n g to your notioo the f o l l o w i n g motion
passed at a recent meeting of Imperial College Students Union.
"Imperial College Union welcomes the concessions to students from
low income f a m i l i e s and on supplementary grants, announced by Her
Majesties Government i n i t s review of the student grant l e v e l .
However i t deplores the d e c i s i o n to awrd only £25 out of the £50
increase estimated by the Brown advisory panel on student maintenance
grants as necessary to maintain the students' standard of l i v i n g and
requests that t h i s d e c i s i o n be reviewed before the I969/70 s e s s i o n .
The recommendation of the Brown advisory panel.was to maintain
the r e a l value of undergraduate and equivalent awards. The Government,
by not implementing these recommendations, has lowered the student .
standard of l i v i n g f o r the second time since 19^2. The standard of
l i v i n g of students must now be increased by li^bin order to r a i s e i t to
the I962 l e v e l .
In 1959 the present chancellor Ray Jenkins wrote i n "The Labour
Case" that many students then suffered from being on a generally
inadequate (income) scale and also s a i d that the state must take
r e s p o n s i b l y f o r a r a t h e r greater generosity i n a l l respects and f o r
p a r t i c a t i o n he s a i d that this would involve a more generous p o l i c y on
student grants.
Prom our observation i t io apparant that the case f o r increasing
student grants i s at present even stronger.
We believe that the Government should treat more expenditure on
U n i v e r s i t y education i s an investment r a t h e r than a waste.
We b e l i e v e that i f the Government continues to adopt p o l i c i e s
which lower student l i v i n g standards the present shortage of graduates
i n science and technology w i l l become more acute and the Government
may be held responsible f o r B r i t a i n f a i l i n g to become more economically
v i a b l e i n the highly competitive t e c h n o l o g i c a l world of today.
at a meeting of I . C . U . c o u n c i l on Monday night, i t was decided
that c o u n c i l would t r y to lower the arsnta of student houses. The
matter aroae out of a report submitted by Dave H a r r i s , the student
house warden, which i n d i c a t e d rents could be lowered by 10/~ per person
per week without the house running at a l o s s . Bob F r y e r , acting H a l l s
Rep, pushed through a a c t i o n covering t h i s point as w e l l as recommending
that the b a s i c r e n t should include such things as heating, l i g h t i n g and
the supply of bed l i n e n .
C o u n c i l also decided to rent a colour T . V . f o r the union, r e v e r s i n g
J e f f S t e e r ' s previous d e c i s i o n rent black and white. K e i t h Guy was
a l s o o f f i c a l l y elected Chairman of Ents f o r the second successive year.
