COMMENT
The opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.
I
feel for nurses. I don’t mean the
sort of nurses who wear fishnets
and appear readily in a Google
images search, I mean the sort
which work in hospitals up and
down the country. After a recent report
from a nursing ombudsman, this pro-
fession is in for yet another bashing for
reasons I can only think of as spurious.
The recent accusations that are lev-
elled at nursing staff in particular relate
to a small number of very select cases,
where nurses have been accused of poor
care for dying patients. You will under-
stand that as a scientist I am suspicious
immediately.
Of course it is difficult to watch some-
one die, especially if it is a loved one who
is, by definition, irreplaceable. It must be
impossible to know what to do or where
to look or what to say. Perhaps that is part
of the problem. Should people who are
not trained in healthcare, healthcare pro-
vision or even medical science and who
are in an emotional state be in the driving
seat on NHS reform?
Nursing can, of course, be done badly.
But this applies to teaching, train driving
and fox hunting as well though. That,
as we have seen is not a good enough
reason to lay into it. The trouble is that
nurses will not fight back. They are a
compassionate race who, like medics of
all kinds, are blamed when things do not
go the way a sick person, or the relative
of one, may wish them to. Let us try to
look at it from the nurses’ perspective.
They have hospital policy, a boss, a con-
sultant (or more than one) and innumer-
able guidelines to satisfy. And you can
bet none of them went into the profes-
sion for any of that.
Even on a practical level, you have a
ward of people needing your attention,
do you attend to them or do you sit at
the deathbed with the family? It might
surprise you to learn that relatives in-
terviewed seemed keen for nurses to sit
there with them without consideration
of other duties. With the best will in the
world, and even if it were practicable, is
it reasonable to consider that this is what
everyone wants?
All the cases are littered with such
incongruities to the point at which one
cannot determine whether or not any
malpractice was evident. Healthcare
staff of all sorts do a magnificent job,
usually under very difficult circum-
stances. Will working against them in
this way help anyone’s healthcare? I
think not.

Why attack nurses?
Dear Sir,
I would like to comment on Alex Kend-
all’s views on the social amenities fund.
He mentions that he is fundamentally
opposed to amenities funds paying for
alcohol and food at social events. I
don’t believe he fully appreciates that
the funds are there to support socialis-
ing and for the vast majority this in-
volves enjoying a drink and food. He
tries to make parallels with union clubs
and how they have banned the buying
of food and alcohol. However, this is a
completely separate issue as the funds
for union clubs come directly from Im-
perial college fund and therefore should
not be used on socialising as the money
they receive is allocated for the buying
of consumables. The fund for the hall
amenities comes from the residences
accommodation fees which imperial
College has no input into. Therefore,
the residences should decide how they
spend their money and not imperial col-
lege union. This is the reason we have
hall committees.
I have been a member of the hall
Letters
committee at Clayponds, which is
formed of hall residences alcohol and
non-alcohol drinkers from the halls I
live in, for nearly a year now and I have
never heard anyone say that they are
opposed to using the funds to buy alco-
hol or food. In fact I can use a parody of
my own which highlights the absurdity
of the argument Alex is trying to make:
I am allergic to nuts but I don’t expect
nuts to be banned from social events,
instead I choose not to eat them and
try the alternatives that are available.
This is the same issue I have with the
comments that Alex has made about
alcohol. If I didn’t drink I wouldn’t ex-
pect other people to not drink, instead I
would drink alternatives that are always
available such as lemonade or cola.
He was elected to represent the views
of the students but I believe he has failed
in his ability to grasp the views of the
students he is supposed to represent. I
think he should stop his egotistical, ill
conceived views from spoiling our so-
cial events and let us decide how we
would like to spend our money.
Yours sincerely,
Adam Cribbs
