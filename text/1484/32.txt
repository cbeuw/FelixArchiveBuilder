The River Nene has been kind to ICBC on occa-
sions, and this year’s BUCS 4s and 8s Head was
one of those as success after success was had over
the weekend. Every crew entered were in the top
ten of their event, 111 BUCS points were won from
the club’s performance in the Championship events
and the medal haul was impressive with 4 golds, 2
silvers and 4 bronzes awarded.
It was an early start on the cold wet Saturday
morning as the ICBC Novice Squadron made their
way to Peterborough for the first day of racing,
which is dedicated solely to Beginners. Once as-
sembled on the boggy banks of the river with boats
rigged, the Team Chat was given by coaches Don
McLachlan, Stu Whitelaw and Dougie Thoms. The
first races were for the women’s four (Harriet Cross/
Maddy Whybrow/ Rosie Davies/ Sarah Tattersall/
cox: Libby Richards) and the men’s eight (cox: Jess
Johnson/ Tommy Hirst/ Tom McArdle/ Xavier Lor-
rain/ Tom Carpenter/ Alex Quigley/ Mattieu Bur-
nard-Galpin/ Robbie Hernandez/ Reuben Hill). As
they boated, with the rain pouring down, the 2.5km
race ahead suddenly seemed much further.
All was going well in the men’s eight as lengths
of clear water were put on crews around them un-
til the final 500m, when an unfortunate crab by
the strokeman cost the crew valuable seconds and
they finished 8th in their category. In the meantime,
the women’s four were storming down the course,
avoiding crews crashing all around and crossed the
line, snatching the bronze medal in the process. In
the second division, four further members were add-
ed to the women’s four to make the eight (Cox: Al-
ice Wickham/ Rowena Harrison/ Tattersall/ Davies/

time, the men’s four (Hirst/ McArdle/ Lorrain/ Car-
penter/ cox: Johnson) were hindered once again,
this time off the start, by some “week-old novices”
and yet still managed to take 6th place.
On Sunday, the senior rowers awoke to dry skies
and all were feeling relatively positive. On arrival
at the course, it was obvious why the locals refer to
it as Peter-bog-rough Head; the field had become
a mire overnight. Unaffected, all of the seniors
boated for the first division. The Championship and
Intermediate head is run over double the distance
(5km) of the Beginner Head and, immediately,
the squad started as they meant to go on, bringing
home three golds and a bronze. The lightweight
quad (Tom Pearson/ Tim Richards/ Wilf Kimber-
ley/ Gareth Brown) was the fastest boat of the divi-
sion, winning their category in 11 seconds ahead of
every other. The coxless four (Danny Bellion/ Hen-
ry Goodier/ Matt Whaley/ Rory Sullivan) won their
category by another convincing 9 seconds ahead of
arch-rivals, Durham.Another gold was won by IC’s
Intermediate coxed four (Adam Seward/ Jake Lea-
Wilson/ Matt Lunt/ Paul Jones/ cox: Jess Johnson,)
who overtook the boat ahead within 200m from the
start. The Championship coxed four (Simon Steele/
Alistair Hudson/ Ben Spencer-Jones/ Leo Car-
rington/ cox: Libby Richards) started first in their
division and brought home the bronze medal.
As soon as the first division was complete, prepa-
ration for the second began. Frantic re-rigging
of the lightweight quad to a coxless four and the
heavyweight four to a quad was required once the
boats were off the water. In the blink of an eye, the
