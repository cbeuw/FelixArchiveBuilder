Apologies!
On Thursday 17 February nominations
for all sabbatical positions and student
trustees were unavailable between
~13:30 and ~14:20 as the server on
which they are hosted was down.
This was not due to the actions of the
Union, rather the College made the
decision to take the server offline.
The Rector has apologised to all who
were inconvenienced by this step but
please contact the returning officer
at elections@imperial.ac.uk if you feel
your nomination was affected.
