The Felix Sex Survey has done an R.
Kelly at playtime – come and gone. We
learnt some important facts. There are
more bisexuals than homosexuals. I can
only assume that the ratio forces you to
branch out while still keeping your op-
tions open. Leveraging you into a posi-
tion where you can either move teams or
stay put. If nothing else – it produced a
couple of great quotes.
One girl said:
“Boys NEVER hit on me here! Lit-
erally, the better I look, the more they
run away. I get the most attention
when I look a bit rubbish. They need to
MAN-UP!”
Translation:
“I’m a 5 with delusions of being a 9”
One guy said:
“[I attended a] 27 all-male orgy host-
ed by an ex-TV presenter. One of the
most incredible experiences of my life
– and another ‘thing to do before I die’
checked off the list.”
That’s put you off your food, hasn’t it?
Not the quote, you homophobe – if you
thought that’s what I meant you need to
have a good look at yourself. The smell
of bullshit is what is putting you off your
food. It’s emanating from that quote in
an inverse square law (a joke for my
geeks out there, peace out G-TOWN).
This was an all male orgy, meaning the
quote must have come from a man. This
backs up my claim that it’s bullshit. You
see … men lie all the time. If it’s not a
lie, it’s an exaggeration. Here are some
exploratory examples to ponder:
“Regional manager for a large corpo-
ration” = “Starbucks assistant store
manager”
“Mate I got with her” = “She hugged
me at the end of the night. It was the
best moment of my life. I’m going to
think about it during my alone time in
bed tonight. I’m so lonely.”
“It’s 7 inches” = “It’s 5 inches”
You want more proof? What the fuck
is this, a lab report? You’re not going to
get any.
Basically, lying is exponential as
fuck. “Why exponential, and not a
straight line?” I hear you indignantly
think to yourself. That is a good ques-
tion, well done for asking. You see, for
the first hour or so men are just too
tired and dazed to lie frequently. Ly-
ing is mentally straining, and first thing
in the morning is too early. As the day
progresses the lies pile up. If someone
has done an all nighter, they most likely
don’t even believe what they’re saying
any more.
That’s not very detailed is it? You
want more detail don’t you? You are
wondering if I am going to write another
question aren’t you? I spoil you I really

do. Below is a pie chart showing the
breakdown of lies told by men:

why is your dj name Bruce Willis?
The thin dark blue slice is how much
they drank last night. The rest is
varying lies about sexual prowess.
The number of participants gives it
away as a lie. It’s like when you’re mak-
ing up results for a lab report. A 30 per-
son orgy would be too round a number
so they just took off three. It’s still way
too high, seriously, 27! How fucking
big was that bed! Did they have to rear-
range the furniture to make way for floor
space?
Definitely noteworthy is that it says
‘hosted by.’ What the fuck did he do –
walk out in a suit and tell a few jokes be-
fore announcing the first guest? He must
have put a lot of work into planning and
promoting. That sort of shit doesn’t just
break out, unless it’s an episode of that
pile of shit Skins. How the fuck do you
organise a 27 all guy orgy anyway? You
can’t exactly make a Facebook event
can you.
Do you call everyone up? It’s not like
you can text around is it. If you have
ever organised a night out, you know
that you need to get different groups of
people to come if you want a large num-
ber. People will only go if a group of
people are already confirmed. The real
question is: how do you pitch that to the
first guy you call? That must have been
an extremely awkward conversation.
“Hey mate. So, I’m organising a 27
all guy orgy, are you game? Who’s go-
ing, erm, that’s the thing. You’re my first
call. You know, have to start somewhere.
It’s almost an honour for me to ask you
first… Hello? Must have lost the con-
nection, he’s probably on the tube.”
Would be worse if he didn’t pick up.
That voicemail would be extremely
strange.
Remember how it’s an odd number,
27. So one poor guy might have been left
on his own, just watching, wondering
why no one wants to explore his insides,
or be explored by him. Poor guy. I bet he
grows a beard and looks shifty at airports
in the hopes of getting a cavity search. I
reckon his doctor no longer believes that
he is a ‘hypochondriac’ and therefore
needs so many prostate exams. At least
he had a nice story to tell though.
In summary: Don’t believe everything
you read, and rotate doctors.
