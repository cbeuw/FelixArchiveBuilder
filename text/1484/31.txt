Boat Club bring in 111
BUCS points at muddy
Peterborough
Men’s Championship quad (Sullivan/
Goodier/ Hudson/ Steele) and the Light-
weight Four (Pearson/ T Richards/ Kim-
berley/ Brown) were back on the water
and were bringing home more medals;
silver and gold respectively, with the
lightweights having a lead of 35 seconds
on every other crew.
The start of the second division also
marked the arrival of the women’s
squadron whose Championship quad
(Chloe Symmonds/ Louise Connell/
Christina Duffy/ Selina Graham) cam-
paign didn’t quite go to plan when a log
tangled itself around the fin and gave the
crew an extra deadweight to lug down
the course, costing them vital time. De-
spite this, the girls managed a very re-
spectable sixth place and increased the
total BUCS points. It was then their turn
to de-rig and re-rig their quad to a four
(Symmonds/ Connell/ Duffy/ Graham)
and rapidly returned to the river for
their next race, which they successfully
smashed to bring home another bronze
medal for the club.
By the time of the third division, 10km
had already been raced flat out by many
members of ICBC, and yet the most im-
portant race of the day (to many) was yet
to come – Men’s eights. On the way to
the start, both ICBC crews kept the pres-
sure light to let the aching legs attempt
to recover before smashing it down the
course for a second or third time. The
Intermediate eight (cox: Johnson/ Pear-
son/ T Richards/ Bellion/ Lea-Wilson/
Seward/ Brown/ Lunt/ Jones) had an
eventful finish to the race as they ambi-
tiously attempted to overtake two crews
at once but unfortunately this ended in
a clash with Newcastle, causing Lunt to
crab and break his footplate in one fell
swoop 200m from the finish. Despite the
theatrics, the bronze medal was theirs.
The Championship eight (cox: L Rich-
ards/ Whaley/ Sullivan/ Spencer-Jones/
Goodier/ Steele/ Hudson/ Kimberley/
Carrington) were confident in their own
abilities and Whaley urged the boys to
focus on their rowing and rhythm and
see just what they could do. The crew
looked solid down the last 750m, hold-
ing their form, and were praised and
cheered on from the bank. All the effort
paid off and the silver medal was theirs,
behind the Cambridge Blue Boat, all of
whom had not raced earlier in the day.
In one of the club’s most success-
ful weekends, Imperial was the second
university overall and every senior man
walked away with a medal from each
event he entered. At the start of the Head
Race season, all wait with baited breath
what ICBC can achieve next.

I’m sure there are supposed to be other boats racing against us...
