College shuts down Union server
Union calls move “overblown”
as Rector apologises
Senior Union figures were left at odds
with College last week when the Union’s
server was shut down by ICT security
following a complaint made by a mem-
ber of the public about an article posted
on the Rugby Club’s website. The Union
reacted angrily issuing a statement call-
ing the shutdown “overblown and un-
necessary” and accusing the College of
failing to follow proper procedures.
The main Clubs & Societies server had
a ban placed on its primary IP at 13:30
on Thursday 17th February by ICT Se-
curity for just under an hour. This re-
sulted in all Clubs & Societies websites
becoming inaccessible, along with the
room booking system and the eVoting
site currently accepting nominations for
Sabbatical elections. The shutdown is
like to have caused significant disrup-
tion to students attempting to participate
in the elections or book rooms for their
Clubs & Societies; as a comparison, in
the hour before the shutdown, the server
received 14,429 page requests.
The offending article in question was
a match report of Imperial Rugby Club
Old Boys recent victory against London
New Zealand II’s in the Middlesex Mer-
it League 1 competition. It contained the
use of the word “fuck” on two occasions
and made indirect reference to a mem-
ber of the public.
Upon reading the article, Deputy Pres-
ident (Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones
and President Alex Kendall concluded
“that there was nothing offensive, and
certainly nothing illegal about [the ar-
ticle.]” However, the member of public
complained that the article was libellous.
Before shutting down the server,
emails were sent to the Union Presi-
dent’s personal Imperial account. Ac-
cording to the Union, no other attempts
were made to contact other members of
the Union, including the Union System
Administrator who manages the server.
In an email to senior members of the
College, including the Rector Sir Keith
O’Nions, Heather Jones called the lack
of communication “utterly indefen-
sible”.
IT Security Manager Chris Roberts
commented: “ICT acted on the instruc-
tions of the Central Secretariat to dis-
connect the Union website. I understand
that the Secretariat had tried to contact
the Union President before disconnect-
ing the website, but had been unable to
reach him at the time.”
At approximately 14:20 the ban on the
Union server was removed and it was
fully operational again. However, the
Rugby Club website remained disabled
until around 17:30 by which time the ar-
ticle had been edited to asterisk out the
swear words and the offending sentence
had been removed.

Sherfield
NatWest
to close
in May
Aemun Reza
Rector gets pied
The Sherfield branch of NatWest is due
to close in May after the bank decided not
to renew its lease. The closure will leave
only one bank on campus, Santander, and
there are concerns that international stu-
dents will be badly hit by the loss of the
student expertise at the branch.
By Wednesday it became that efforts
to persuade the bank to retain its branch
had failed. The closure will force the
College to change some of its financial
procedures; the Commercial outlets on
campus pay approximately £7 million in
notes and coins into the branch annually.
Malcolm Aldridge, Financial Control-
ler of Imperial College London, says
that the main aim for the College it to
determine how the closure of the branch
will affect Imperial financially as well as
to ensure that it won’t negatively affect
Imperial by taking significant security
precautions
He declined to comment on whether
another bank would replace NatWest,
saying that no dicussions had been had
yet. However, with three months until
the bank closes he is confident that the
College’s financial operations will not
be negatively affected.
But it does seem that International stu-
dents may be affected the most by the
RAG tradition revived: Page 2
