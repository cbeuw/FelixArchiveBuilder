Could it be that there is no other play
with a more sarcastic title than The
World of Extreme Happiness?
The play begins with two Chinese
men, complete with dirt on their faces
obviously to signify their countryside
origins, foul-mouthing about whores
and pigeons excreting in their mouths.
Frustration is the main emotion felt
by all characters, and it manifests
itself in the aggressive yet nonchalant
swearing which many born into manic
Chinese households will probably be
habituated to.
China is a land of shock and
stupefaction, according to the media.
But The World of Extreme Happiness
takes us through all this, from the
attempted murder of Sunny (Katie
Leung, perhaps better known as
Cho Chang of Harry Potter fame)
at her birth – among hundreds of
others mentioned – because she is
a girl born into a one-child policy,
to the powerlessness of the country
folk without access to education
and eventually enslaved in a mass-
producing factory. The audience
hears of the brutality of Mao and the
continued power of the state to crush
anything or anyone letting oﬀ a mere
whiﬀ of deﬁance.
It is interesting to consider these
events of the play in the context of the
reality of contemporary China. What
are the real impacts on the people
that the policies are directly aﬀecting
today?
Looking around the audience, it
seemed that there were more East
Asian members compared to other
plays I have attended, which usually
consist of the white middle class en
masse. For me, being third generation
Chinese not to be born in China, it
was rather fun to identify with some
of the behaviour, mannerisms, and
attitudes of the family members that
reﬂected those of my own. I wondered
what those with stronger links to
China and its history thought of the
more controversial events acted out.
Intense and shocking, it would
not be the same without a bit of
orgasm, kidnap, attempted suicide,
and murder. A rapid-heart-rate-
inducing ﬂashing rainbow light and
vibrating bass reinforced the mania of
the city life of Shenzhen. Doll babies
manufactured by the featured factory
were lit up and ﬂashed in an eerie way
next to a kitsch ﬁsh tank.
The staging and direction (Michael
Longhurst) were the deﬁnite
highlights. In such an intimate venue
as The Shed, the change of setting
from countryside to factory to police
station, and more, is carried out
perfectly. At one point, the birth of a
baby is represented by ripping a doll
T
he Frieze Art Fair, now in its
11thyear,isoneoftheworld’s
leading contemporary art
fairs, and has helped shape
London into a nucleus of
creativity and vision.
This year, 152 galleries were invited
to assemble in one space in Regent’s
park, and display the best of what
they could oﬀer. And they did not
disappoint; from Tokyo to New York,
together they brought an international
feel to the fair and gave it dynamism
truly unique to Frieze. This diversity
makes for a thrilling and eye-opening
experience where you do not know
what to expect from one gallery to
another.
But the true beauty of Frieze is that
it showcases artists currently at the
forefront of innovation, the ones that
are deﬁning what the future of art shall
be. Frieze Frame, a specialist section
of the fair, oﬀers less established
galleries a chance to exhibit a single
artist in depth and, for me, this is
where you really saw the innovation.
Here, up-and-coming artists have an
opportunity to display their works
and you are really able to see how
art is evolving, especially when you
compare it to the older contemporary
art elsewhere at the fair.
As you walk into the fair’s main
pavilion, it is as if you are walking into
another world, a world that leaves
behind the hectic reality outside and
suspends you in a white bubble of
imagination. Unobtrusive lighting and
architecture create a cloud of clean
minimalism, perfectly designed to
display art of any kind, and expansive
space allows viewing without any
intrusion on your intimate experience
of the art.
The people of Frieze are almost as
intriguing as the art itself. To see a
man in platforms, a fur coat and Viking
helmet adds to the bizarre spectacle.
You feel it is an opportunity for all the
arty types of London to ﬂaunt their
stuﬀ – or maybe they are seeing just
how far you can push deﬁnitions of art
and fashion. But it does create vitality
and a playful – if not a tad surreal –
atmosphere that really enhances my
yearly pilgrimage to Frieze.
The idea of people as art is not
just limited to how visitors dress. A
number of interactive works included
the viewer as an integral part, none
more so than James Lee Byars’ Four
in a Dress. It is exactly how it sounds:
four people facing each other in a
circle, all wearing one dress. What I
loved about this piece is how inclusive
it was. The four people were allowed to
talk to one another and the audience,
giving everyone a slightly diﬀerent
experience.
Viewer participation seemed a
common theme this year and Ian
Cheng’s Entropy Wrangler Cloud gave
it a modern, scientiﬁc feel. He created
a virtual world, viewed through
simulator goggles that immersed
the viewer in the new reality. The
comically large goggles and amazed
expressions on the participants’ faces
as they experienced this world made
for hilarious viewing.
In fact, alternate realities featured
heavily as a concept this year,
reinforcing the progressive modernity
of the fair. Because so much of our
daily lives are now online and virtual,
this art felt up-to-date and was thus
instantly relatable.
In the end, the idea of a fair is to sell
art. But that was never really obvious
at Frieze, bar the huddle of curators
you would see every so often. It was
heartening to see the artists were also
not too preoccupied by the ﬁnancial
side of art. They did not ostensibly
create works that would be an easy sell,
for example Jennifer Rubell’s Portrait
of the Artist; a gigantic sculpture of a
pregnant woman where you are meant
to crawl inside her womb. Not the
most practical of pieces… However,
with the Tate buying four works from
this year’s fair, maybe there is a market
for the kind of piece that doesn’t quite
ﬁt on a rich patron’s wall.
The Frieze Art Fair really is a key
cultural event and I can only see
it becoming bigger and even more
inﬂuential. It really is cutting edge,
and is shaping the future of art as
we know it. And despite the hefty
entrance fee (£23 for students!), it has
become not only a signiﬁcant hub for
contemporary art, but also the kind of
chic place any young Londoner would
want to be seen.
The Frieze art fair this year took
place 17th – 20th October. The fair is
held annually in Regent’s Park, NW1,
entrance £32, students £23.
out of a cardboard box... I’ll go with
that.
Although the cast of 6 used to play
at least 12 characters was successful
thanks to such work, the actors did
not match it so perfectly. At points
they made it diﬃcult to accept this
exaggerated reality was, well, a
potential reality.
The ending (spoiler alert), an
imitation of One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest, seemed to mimic
the way a friend of mine pretended
to ﬂap around whilst mocking the
suﬀocation of characters such as the
one in question. This professional
version was almost as laughable. But
overall, with a slight polish, Frances
Ya-Chu-Chowig’s work could ﬁt
amongst contemporary masterpieces.
