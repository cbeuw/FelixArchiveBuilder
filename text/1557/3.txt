Student protestors in London and Birmingham targeted Liberal
Democrat oﬃces “in opposition to student debt sell oﬀ” last Friday.
The actions were against what NCAFC (National Campaign Against
Fees and Cuts) said in a statement would be a “vast and retroactive
stealth hike in tuition fees” following the coalition government’s
planned sell oﬀ of the student loan book over the next decade.
Student Loans Protest
Police have released shocking footage of a US student being
attacked by a gang of Asians because he was “clearly not a local”.
The CCTV clearly shows ﬁve Asian men set upon 22-year-old
Francesco Hounye, who had only arrived in the UK three days
earlier. After smashing a bottle into his face, they chased after
him and continued their assault - kicking and punching him.
The attack happened at 12.40am on Commercial Road, East London,
after Hounye was returning from a night out in Brick Lane on 17 June.

Researchers have demonstrated how to produce electronic inks for the
development of new applications using the ‘wonder material’
, carbon
nanotubes.
Working with an industrial partner, Linde Electronics, they have produced an
electrically-conductive carbon nanotube ink, which coats carbon nanotubes
onto ultra-thin sheets of transparent film that are used to manufacture flat-
screen televisions and computer screens.

A
mysterious stranger
was caught wandering
Tizard last Sunday. The
man was described as
tall with dark skin and
badly dressed. He was wearing a red
jacket and was noted to be carrying a
Bible and had an American accent.
The intruder was escorted from
the premises by hall security and the
Tizard warden. There has been no
further information about who the
man was and his purpose in entering
the halls.
The Falmouth and Keogh Hall
wardens are re-emphasising the
importance of stopping people from
tailgating, a very common occurrence
in halls. They have said that residents
should never let anyone they do not
know into the building. If residents
come across someone who refuses to
swipe in or does not have an ID card
than that person would be reported.
They have also reiterated that
swiping into both the hall itself and
the main entrance is very important
for security records. This is so they
can keep a record of who is going in
and out of the halls and is useful for
if someone cannot be located for a
number of days.
It’s especially prudent to pay
attention to security risks at the start
of term - Ed.

General advice to
stay safe
1. Make sure the front doors
close behind you.
2. Do not let anyone tailgate
you into the building. If they say
they are a student you can ask
them to swipe their card too (a
green light will show on the card
reader even if you have already
opened the door).
3. Ask guests to wait outside
and phone the student they are
visiting.
4. If you feel intimidated
into letting someone into halls
call security or the duty warden
immediately.
5. Always make sure your
room door closes properly
behind you.
6. If you see anything
suspicious then call security or
the duty warden.

n September the annual QS
university rankings were
released, Imperial College
London ranked 5th place.
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology topped the table for the
second year running, achieving a QS
score of 100. Harvard took 2nd place,
Cambridge was ranked 3rd, University
College London was 4th and Imperial
was 5th.
Therefore, from the top ﬁve rankings
in the world, three of the universities
are British. Within the top 20, six
of the univeristies are British; the
other universities are the University
of Edinburugh and King’s College
London. Switzerland has one and
Canada has two in the top 20, the
remaining eleven are all American.
It was also found that students that
graduate from Oxford and Cambridge
are considered the most employable in
the world.
Ben Sowter, QS head of research,
states that “the brand-name value
of Oxbridge has so far survived any
negative publicity following the tuition
fee hikes and student protests”.
With the recent Careers Fairs we’ve
been having and the ever present
marquees hopefully this will give some
of you a boost in your step as your
approach graduate recruiters, they
defintiely want you! - Ed.
