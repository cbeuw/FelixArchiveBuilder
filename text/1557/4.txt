mperial’s iGEM (international
Genetically Engineered Machine)
team have just ﬂown back from
Lyon, ﬁnishing in the top three
in Europe in the international
Synthetic Biology competition and
progressing to the next round at MIT
in Boston.
We all know Imperial is good at
Engineering. What you may not know
is that they can even engineer living
things. It may sound crazy but that is
what the people here at the Centre for
Synthetic Biology and Innovation are
doing. Whether sitting all quiescent
or quaking visibly (the latter being
the iGEM team), ideas pop into their
heads about what they would like
living things to do, then they set about
it. This is exactly what it is all about:
can biology be used in those delicate
and complicated situations where
traditional engineering is failing us, in
waste management for example?
This is the focus of Team Plasticity’s
project; turning a mixed waste
which is actually the result of high
tech recycling facilities into a plastic
made inside living cells. Hundreds
of thousands of tonnes of this waste,
called Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) are
shipped to Europe to be incinerated
every year. Now you may think ah,
fuel, that is a good thing, right? Well,
I am sorry to say this but, ugh-urgh,
incorrect.
No 1- it pollutes the environment
and some studies have linked
increased levels of cancer to nearby
incinerators.
No 2- it does not make economic
sense, with millions of pounds per
annum spent on disposal by each
recycling plant.
No.3- it is a downright waste of
resources.
One third of the SRF is made of
plastics and the rest is paper, wood
and ﬁbres. What if you could do
something better with this? What
if you could turn it into a viable
alternative to petrochemical plastics
which are causing so much pollution
and at the same time recycle the
plastics already in there? Well, this is
what we have been working on.
We did this as part of the iGEM
competition which challenges over
200 teams from around the world
to design and make a system using
the principles of Synthetic Biology
(Syn Bio). This is the application
of engineering principles such as
speciﬁcations, modularisation and
computer modeling to biology. Last
weekend all the teams from Europe,
60 in total, met to celebrate their hard
work at the regional jamboree. There
were some really incredible projects
and we were lucky enough to place in
the top three, earning a place in the
ﬁnal at MIT, starting 1st November.
We have engineered E.coli to
produce the bioplastic poly-3-
hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inside
themselves when using this waste as
their only energy source. PHB is pretty
amazing. Not only can it be used
as an alternative to petrochemical
plastics, it can form tissue scaﬀolds
which are broken down as the
body heals and even be 3D printed.
Importantly, it can breakdown in the
environment, albeit slowly, into non-
toxic compounds. One of the biggest
issues stopping these plastics playing
a more important role in our lives
is their cost, which is largely due to
their production from plant biomass.
Our system aims to lower this price
and deal with the environmental
issues associated with incineration
and petrochemical plastics. After the
bioplastic has been used it will be fed
into our recycling system, to ensure it
itself is not wasted.
iGEM is not just about the science. It
is also a hotbed of creativity where the
teams are encouraged to think about
how their projects will impact on the
world. This is all towards the goal
of responsible innovation; ensuring
that the technologies are causing
more good than harm. Our system is
designed to work at an industrial scale
but we have also looked at how our
world might look in the future, when
waste is seen as a precious resource.
We have designed a concept home
bioreactor linked to a 3D printer,
directly turning your waste into brand
new objects. Maybe in the future you
won’t have to take the bin bag out, but
instead you will be able to print some
new shoes!

IMPERIAL IGEM
I
mperial College has had a long
tradition of hosting prestigious
chess events in London, starting
several decades ago with the
Kensington Congress – this fell
by the wayside somewhat in the early
2000’s but was revived by Imperial
College alumnus John Sargent in
2011 with the help of IC Chess Club’s
committee and the English Chess
Federation.
Now in its third edition, on a
cool October afternoon a group of
enthusiastic normally-players set
aside some hours to turn the Union
Dining Hall into a serious tournament.
Having done this twice before things
went extremely smoothly for the start
of the congress, which is just as well
because entries were so successful that
the congress was full to capacity well
in advance of the event taking place.
By ﬁve o’clock, the room was ready
and already the ﬁrst few players were
turning up in advance, arriving at the
Union representing clubs from all
over England and in a few cases from
mainland Europe as well!
There was something else at stake
for the top English (or resident) players
in the Open section as well, as the
highest ranked player at the end of the
weekend not already qualiﬁed would
be eligible for a place in the British
Chess Championships in 2014.
The ﬁrst round on Friday night
proved to be particularly entertaining
towards the end of the evening as the
concert downstairs in Metric gave
the remaining concentrating players
a complimentary massage thanks
to the bass causing more or less the
entire building to vibrate! Players were
forewarned and luckily the eﬀects
weren’t too detrimental – although
we’re not sure how many ﬁnished
their games to go dancing downstairs
afterwards.
Top seed in the Open section Miguel
Navarro-Cia, who is a Research Fellow
at Imperial College in addition to a
chess FIDE Master, was dramatically
held to a draw by Denmark’s Helge
Hjort, assuring that the pecking order
in the top section would not necessarily
dictate the weekend’s results. Another
one of the top seeds Patryk Stanisz
of Poland was defeated by England’s
Stephen Prior to turn any semblance of
expected top results on its head.
Saturday saw a quieter day with
mixed fortunes for the higher rated
opponents in the other Major and
Minor sections – generally the higher
rated players had a good day in the
Major to ﬁnish Round 3 roughly in
the top quarter of the draw, but the
Minor saw a lot of exciting, ﬁghting
games allowing some of the lower rated
players to prove themselves. By the end
of Saturday evening, England’s David
Gilbert was leading the standings here
with two players under 120 ECF grade
also in the top ﬁve – Cledwyn Davies of
Wales and Southampton University’s
Rob Hewitt.
After a brief emergency (well,
running out of sugar for coﬀee/tea) on
Sunday morning, the stage was set for
an interesting ﬁnish. Top seed Navarro-
Cia would have to ﬁnd a way to battle
back from a full point down while
Stephen Prior (rated 300 FIDE points
his junior) was leading the tournament
with a perfect score but having to fend
oﬀ some stiﬀ challenges in the ﬁnal
rounds. Peru’s Frank Lozano in the
mean time was half a point clear of the
ﬁeld in the Major, and David Gilbert
found himself in the same position in
the Minor.
Only half a point behind going into
the ﬁnal round, the top board Isaac
Craft and Stephen Prior (both ENG)
drew, guaranteeing them a share of ﬁrst
place but with the possibility of being
caught for a share of the spoils. We
thought we might have received an 80-
move epic – turns out 75 of those were
to be played over a blitz board outside
the playing hall.
Despite his best eﬀorts, however,
Miguel was held to a draw by a resolute
Steven Jones to ﬁnish half a point
behind the leaders in an incredibly
tense ﬁnish. The Minor was next for the
top positions to be settled, with David
Gilbert ﬁnishing on an imperious 4.5
with Phil Foley and a strong showing
by Rob Hewitt half a point behind.
Finally, the Major section was won by
Mateusz Dydak who won his last game
to stay half a point clear of the ﬁeld – all
three of the 2nd= players won their last
round as well, chasing him all the way.
Thank you very much to Adam
Raoof (our esteemed FIDE arbiter),
the Imperial College Chess Club, the
Union and all the players for making
the event incredibly enjoyable and
memorable.
