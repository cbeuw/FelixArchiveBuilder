Food Revival Top Tips
1. For bread that has gone hard, dampen
the outside of the loaf with a bit of water
and pop it in the oven for 10 mins at around
180oC. This also works for limp biscuits!
But just 5 mins will do.
2. To keep lettuce fresh, separate the leaves
and store them in a bowl of water in the
fridge. Replace the water every few days.
3. Bought too many sausages for your
weekend fry up? Use it in a stir fry!
4. Chop up bananas that are about to go
off and freeze them - this will make a very
nice revision treat!
5. Too much cheese? Grate and freeze it
so you can put it straight into pasta sauces
or even lasagnes.

H
ow much food do we
throw away? Well, a
quick survey in the EEE
Level 5 labs shows that
as students, we try to
eat everything we buy in our shop.
Unfortunately students only make up
about 4% of the UK population, and
Tesco has revealed earlier this week
that it generated almost 30,000 tonnes
of food waste in the ﬁrst 6 month of
2013. Just to put that into perspective,
that is just over 1500 new Boris buses
full of passengers, each eating 2
Weetabix biscuits and drinking a litre
of milk.
These ﬁgures were based on
information collected from the chain’s
supermarkets, distribution centres,
suppliers and producers. With over
3000 stores in the UK, Tesco suggested
that the two highest categories are
bakery and fruit and vegetables. In
particular, 40% of apples and 68%
of salad sold in bags was wasted.
In response to this, Tesco has
announced that it will end multi-
buy deals on large bags of salad,
removing “display until” dates from
fresh fruit and vegetables, using
smaller delivery cases and rearranging
the bakery display to reduce the
amount of bread sold in store.
The UK government estimates
that 7.2 million tonnes of food and
drink were thrown away from homes
every year, of which the majority can
still be eaten. This comes to a cost
of £12 billion a year for its eﬀect to
environment and wastes resources.
A report released by the Institution
of Mechanical Engineers have found
up to 30% of the UK’s vegetable crop
is never harvested purely for cosmetic
reasons. These are the marketing
policies many supermarkets adopt to
meetconsumerexpectations:rejecting
edible fruit and vegetables at the farm
because of its physical characteristics,
such as size and appearance.
How about Imperial?
There are around 22,000 students
and staﬀ at Imperial, and collectively
we consume a lot of food every day,
but do we eat it all? The College has
been separating food waste from Taste
Imperial outlets at South Kensington
and composting it on site instead of
sending it to landﬁll. Its data shows
that the compost processes nearly 2
tonnes of food waste a week, which
includes unsold leftovers and food left
on the plate. This is quite a staggering
amount, bearing in mind this does not
include food binned in departments.
How about in halls? Since 2008,
the College has been running the
Student Hall Reuse Scheme. The
scheme aims to donate or recycling
items left behind in halls that would
otherwise be sent to landﬁll. In 2012,
an audit was conducted in the student
kitchens and it was identiﬁed that
with a reﬁnement to the system an
extra £7000 of food left behind and
ﬁt for reuse, which could be donated
to causes such as FoodCycle. That is
another reminder of how much money
we spent on food that we did not eat.
What can you do?
Remember the tips we gave you a
few issues back on smart supermarket
shopping. All of them will still be valid
in reducing food waste - at the end of
the day, buy less, waste less and save
money! Writing a list and making
a meal plan will help you make the
most of the food you buy and not in
excess if you know you will be going
out with friends for the evening.
Ifyouhaveyettoﬁndafoodshopping
buddy, then you can still make the
most of the oﬀers without wasting.
Just make sure it says suitable for
freezing and quite often the shelf life
can be increased to around 1 month.
Try to have fresh vegetables and
fruit that are in season. For example,
runner beans and blackberries are in
their prime season now and you can
introduce them to your diet and make
it more interesting! Make some dessert
with blackberries for your weekend
treat or even have runner beans
instead of chips with your burger.
And if you bought too much, you can
always freeze it and use it for next time!
If you are passionate about the topic
and want to work with the College
to decrease food waste and promote
sustainability, Imperial Hub and the
Energy and Sustainbility Department
of College will be launching this
year’s StepChange campaign in a
few weeks. You can now register
to be a Stepchange ambassador on
imperialhub.org/stepchange.
