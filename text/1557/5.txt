FRIDAY 25 OCT
FEATURES
T
he Intergovernmental Panel
for Climate Change (IPCC)
released merely one part
of its six-yearly report last
month, and alarm bells
have begun ringing across the world:
apparently, it is 95% certain humans
have been the largest contributing
factor to global warming since the
1950’s.
A general overview of the key facts
and ﬁgures is a must for digesting
what this report actually says:
* Warming of the climate system is
unequivocal, and since the 1950s,
many of the observed changes are
unprecedented over decades to
millennia. The atmosphere and ocean
have warmed, the amounts of snow
and ice have diminished, sea level
has risen, and the concentrations of
greenhouse gases have increased.
* Each of the last three decades has
been successively warmer at the
Earth’s surface than any preceding
from net land use change emissions.
The ocean has absorbed about 30%
of the emitted anthropogenic carbon
dioxide, causing ocean acidiﬁcation.
* Global surface temperature change
for the end of the 21st century is
likely to exceed 1.5°C relative to
1850 to 1900. Warming will continue
beyond 2100. Warming will continue
to exhibit interannual-to-decadal
variability and will not be regionally
uniform.
Such dire forecasts backed by
mathematical certainty come as a
respite for climate change believers
who in recent years had been
challenged to explain why global
warming rates had been gradually
declining in the last decade. Now,
their response is to say that “due to
decade since 1850. In the Northern
Hemisphere, 1983–2012 was likely
the warmest 30-year period of the last
1400 years.
* Ocean warming dominates the
increase in energy stored in the
climate system, accounting for more
than 90% of the energy accumulated
between 1971 and 2010.
* Over the last two decades, the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
have been losing mass, glaciers have
continued to shrink almost worldwide,
and Arctic sea ice and Northern
Hemisphere spring snow cover have
continued to decrease in extent.
* The rate of sea level rise since the
mid-19th century has been larger than
the mean rate during the previous two
millennia (high conﬁdence). Over the
period 1901–2010, global mean sea
level rose by 0.19m [0.17m to 0.21m].
* The atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide (CO2
), methane, and
nitrous oxide have increased to levels
unprecedented in at least the last
800,000 years. CO2
concentrations
have increased by 40% since pre-
industrial times, primarily from
fossil fuel emissions and secondarily
natural variability, trends based on
short term records are very sensitive
to the beginning and end dates and
do not, in general, reﬂect long term
trends.” This, backed up by the above
facts, could well be indicative of
a very real warning regarding our
impacts on the Earth’s climate.
So the science has been made
clear, but what’s stopping people
or even governments from taking
combative action? One major factor
is the reluctance to take a personal,
conscious stake in moulding the
climate at the cost of short- and
long-term personal comforts, or
even at the cost of a political party
losing popularity. Another common
sentiment is that any human eﬀorts
to reverse the anthropogenic impacts
would be futile, so there’s no point
expending resources to even try to
do so.
All these hard statistics indicate
that the tide is turning against
climate change skeptics in terms of
factual evidence. But has it made
a diﬀerence in terms of motivating
them? As inquired by The American
Thinker, why should we try to prevent
the climate from changing, if it was
even caused by us to begin with?
Change is the only constant in nature
and it could be less complicated and
more appealing to corporate interests
(and therefore, to politicians and
skeptics alike) to invest in adapting
our lifestyles to warmer temperatures
rather than trying to actually bring
the temperature down.
What’s certain is thatall of us impact
the climate to some extent, whether
negligible or not. If you believe we are
the dominant cause, how can you go
about convincing others of this and
what do you think can be feasibly
done to address this? If you believe
our role is arbitrary, how would you
challenge the IPCC report and the
adverse impacts on human life that
are already beginning to manifest
themselves (e.g. more severe natural
disasters?) To be continued…
Want to hear more in-depth
discussions of the IPCC report from
distinguished personalities such
as John Vidal, Professor Sir Brian
Hoskins, and Dr Chris Brierly? Come
along to the London Climate Forum
at Imperial College London on 9th
November for a panel discussion
on this subject and a host of other
exciting talks and exhibitions. Early-
bird tickets are just £7 for students!

An Ultimate Warning?

“Thereʼs no happy
ending where we
prevent climate change
any more. Now the
question is, is it going to
be a miserable century
or an impossible one,
and what comes after
that.”
Bill McKibben, The New York
Times, Dec. 5, 2010
