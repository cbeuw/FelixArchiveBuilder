experience, as well as a short research
project across the summer months
usually submitted in September.
These yearlong courses can provide
an opportunity to deepen and focus
your subject knowledge in an area of
interest from your current degree or
to change direction by studying a new
subject of interest, possibly vocational
or career-related. Entry onto a Masters
is sometimes possible with a 2:2 class
of degree depending on where you
apply but a 2:1 is commonly required
so you will need to research the entry
requirements for each course.
Research courses include MRes
(usually one year) or PhD (three to
four years). These courses are research
based and so as part of your application
process you may be asked to include a
research proposal outlining you area
of interest and relating this to the
research specialisms in the department
you are applying to. There are some
aspects you need to consider carefully
before embarking on a research
degree. Unlike your undergraduate
course your progress through a
research degree is much more self-
driven. Before choosing for this option
you need to think through your level
of motivation, your persistence and
resilience. To be successful you really
need to enjoy your subject area, you
will be immersed in this for the next
three to four years. You should also
have the strength to push yourself
and the determination to overcome
setbacks. You will have a supervisor
to support you but without strong
motivation you will ﬁnd the process
of a PhD diﬃcult. In most cases you
should expect to gain a 1st or a 2:1 in
E
very year, approximately
30% of Imperial College
undergraduates go on to
further study, so we know it’s
a popular option. But what
do you need to know and how do you
make the best choice of course and
institution?
Let’s look at the basics. The ﬁrst
question you need to ask yourself is
what is your long term goal, and how
will further study help you achieve
this. In all cases further study will
take time and in many cases it will also
take money so you need to be clear up
front on what you expect to gain. It
could be that the career area you hope
to go into has a requirement of some
kind of further qualiﬁcation such a
PGCE for teaching or it might be that
you hope to become more specialised
which may open up certain areas of
work. Either way it is important to
weigh up to pros and cons and check
that your expectations are realistic.
Most courses publish information on
outcomes for their graduates so look
carefully to see if people are going on
to the types of work you hope to follow.
What type of course is best - Masters
or PhD or perhaps a better question
initially is taught course or research
course?
MSc and MA courses are normally one
calendar year in length and take the
form of a taught period from October
to May, so very like you undergraduate
your ﬁrst degree and in some instances
it will be expected that you complete a
separate MSc or MRes before applying
to a PhD. It is not unusual now to ﬁnd
a ‘one plus three’ structure where you
apply for both Masters and PhD and
on successful completion of the one
year Masters you continue on to a PhD.
The application process can be
confusing. It takes time to properly
research postgraduate study and
unlike your undergraduate application
there is normally no limit on the
number of Masters or PhD courses
you can apply for. You will need to
complete separate applications forms

for each institution. There are a few
exceptions to this and these tend to
be in very vocational areas such as
PGCE for teaching and Graduate
Diploma courses in Law where you
apply through a clearing system
similar to UCAS. Choosing research
degrees requires even more thought
and it will really help to discuss your
research ideas with your department.
Your academic contacts will have ideas
about how to develop your research
proposal and information about
which research groups and university
departments specialise in your subject.
They may also be able to provide some
introductions for you to do some early
networking or engage in some mini
research experiences. If your ﬁnal year
undergraduate project is connected to
the area you think you might like to
study at PhD then use the opportunity
to set up some links at Imperial and
further aﬁeld through your project.
If you are considering applying for
courses outside the UK you also need
to ﬁnd out about additional tests,
exams and application deadlines. For
instance applicants for postgraduate
study in the USA have to complete an
appropriate admissions test depending
on the subject of study such as the
GMAT, GRE General, GRE Subject
and MCAT. It is also important to
understand not just the application
process but also the structure of
courses, for instance in the USA it is
not unusual to take 8 to 9 years to gain
a PhD. Details on how to apply for
study in the USA can be found via the
Fulbright website at fulbright.org.uk
Finding the funding can also take
time. Whether you are a UK, EU
or international student ﬁnding
funding for postgraduate study is a
complex process. When researching
possible courses you should also be
asking questions about availability of
funding. Are there research council
grants available, industry funded
scholarships, university scholarships?
How many participants have to self-
fund? In the instance of research
council funding you need to check out
the prerequisites and the time scales,
often RCUK funded places require
earlier application deadlines. If you are
considering self-funding you may also
need to check if studying part time is
an option allowing you time to also
work to pay the bills. It is important
to shop around when thinking about
self-funded further study. Universities
charge diﬀering fees particularly at
Masters level so investigate widely to
get the best deal. Europe might be
an option as increasingly European
universities are teaching in English
and often have surprisingly low tuition
fees.

further study and funding can be found

Finally, start your planning early.
Talk to PhDs and Post Docs in your
department. Build up a realistic
picture of what is going to be involved,
the excitement as well as the challenges
and remember that you can arrange
to meet with one of the Careers
Consultant team to discuss your
further study ideas and for support
with the application process.
