FRIDAY 25 OCT
GAMES
games? Its Pokémon, just X 2!
The game does have its own quirky
moments. There are derpy characters
that think out loud, and literally give
away their passwords after you defeat
them. One of your friends can mention
that she has never seen ﬁreworks
alone with a boy before, and then
someone comes up to give the both of
you the Protect TM right after. Some
of the characters want to thank you by
battling you. Game Freak also seems
to have a weird interpretation of the
French culture — there seems to be an
overabundance of cafés. There is no
end of positive reinforcement in the
game. You are constantly rewarded
for talking to NPCs by getting items.
You are constantly told that you are on
your way to greatness.
This is the part of the games that I
am most passionate about, especially
when trying to explain to people
why I still play Pokémon games. For
the avoidance of doubt, I would like
to iterate that Pokémon games are
not just for kids — they have great
gameplay mechanics which make
competitive battling really fun. If you
are not familiar with the mechanics,
this section might not make much
sense to you.
Pokémon X and Y introduce many
welcome changes to the gameplay
mechanics, the eﬀects of which
remain to be seen once the community
gets more familiar with the games and
starts competing.
For the ﬁrst time in the 14 years
since the original release of Pokémon
Gold and Silver, a new type has been
introduced: Fairy. Fairy is introduced
in order to bring balance to the game
by being super-eﬀective against and
immune to the Dragon type. It is
also weak to Poison type, which has
been really underused so far. This is
probably the most exciting change in
this generation, and I am eager to see
how this changes competitive battling.
Mega-evolution is the next biggest
change in mechanics. Some Pokémon
are now able to temporarily mega-
evolve into an ever stronger stage
during a battle. They might get new
abilities, or even change their types.
This comes at the cost of having
to hold a certain item in order to
mega-evolve. At the time of writing,
not all of the mega-evolutions have
been discovered. It also remains to
be seen how this would change the
competitive landscape.
Game Freak has also tried to reduce
the level of grind in the game, one of
the greatest complaints. With the new
Exp Share item that grants 50% of the
experience to all the Pokémon who
did not take part in battles, it is now
extremely easy to level up, although
this could make the game feel too
easy. In fact, by the eighth gym, my
team was 15 levels ahead of the gym
leader. Capturing wild Pokémons
now also gives experience. Training
of eﬀort values (EV) has also been
made easier. There is a new “Super
Training” mini-game that allows you
to boost the desired EV. Breeding has
also seen its fair share of changes by
making it easier to pass on abilities
(including hidden ones), moves, and
even Individual Values from parents.
All of these changes will serve to make
competitive battling more accessible
to newcomers, and will hopefully
encourage more players to take part.
In addition to the “Super Training”
mini-game, there is also the Pokémon-
Amie mini game that allows you to
literally play with your Pokémon by
stroking them and feeding them. This
raises their “aﬀection” level which can
lead to boosted experience games, and
increased accuracy, critical hit ratio,
and evasion rates during battles.
Pokémon X and Y introduces a
known total of 69 new Pokémon,
bringing the entire tally to a whopping
718. While the number of new
Pokémon may pale in comparison with
the previous generation, it should not
detract from the gameplay experience.
The variety of wild Pokémon you can
encounter is simply astounding. By the
second badge, I had already captured
at least 60 unique species, and I was
constantly running out of money to
buy more Pokéballs with. Who knows,
it might be possible to catch’em all!
There are also some additional new
minor features. For example, it is now
possible to ride some Pokémon to
traverse harsh terrains. You could also
have a “sky battle” with certain “sky
trainers” that only Pokémon who have
some semblance of ﬂight abilities can
participate in. You can also encounter
up to ﬁve Pokémon at once in Horde
Encounters. Personally, I ﬁnd these
encounters to be extremely annoying,
although they come with the perk
that the hordes have a high chance of
having their hidden abilities.
The Pokémon series of games has
always been about connectivity.
Starting in Pokémon Diamond
and Pearl, Nintendo has gradually
embraced the internet to allow for
remote connectivity. Pokémon X and
Y brings about the fruition of all the
work in the interleaving games in the
form of the “Player Search System”
(PSS).
The PSS makes it really easy to
interact with other players on the
internet. When connected to the
internet, the PSS will constantly
show you “passerbys”, essentially
other players who are connected to
the PSS, although they are not really
passing by when they are in places like
Tokyo! In this way, random strangers
can challenge you to a battle, or even
perform a trade. The same goes for
friends whom you’ve added to your
friend list. The only complaint about
this system is the lack of text chat. You
could only do voice chat, or nothing.
Wonder Trade is one of the nicest
feature of the PSS. Essentially, it’s
a gambling game where you trade
something in return for something
random decided by the system.
Although rife with trashy Pokémon,
online communities have taken to
“cleansing” the wonder trade system
by putting in really rare Pokémon,
including shiny Pokémon, Pokémon
that are highly sought for, and even
Pokémon infected with the elusive
Pokérus.
Finally, there is a “Friend Safari”
which allows you to capture really
rare Pokémons that cannot be
encountered normally with the
hidden abilities. The type of Pokémon
present is calculated from the friends
you’ve added.
For people of our generation, it is
likely that we grew up with Pokémon
in one way or another. You could
have played Pokémon when you were
young, and then stopped. Or, you
could have been playing Pokémon
while growing up. Game Freak intends
to capitalise on that aspect of nostalgia
one way or another, and this game has
plenty of nostalgic elements.
Pokémon Black and White tried to
invoke nostalgia by making everything
new, so that you could relive the
moments when you picked up the
ﬁrst Pokémon Red and Blue games
for the ﬁrst time. The locations in that
game were entirely new, and none of
the familiar Pokémon appeared until
you’ve beaten the game.
Pokémon X and Y intends to do so
in the opposite manner by giving you
everything that was familiar. Pokémon
introduced in the older generations
are a constant ﬁxture in the game,
and are absolutely abundant. You
could literally catch a Pikachu an hour
into the game. The ﬁrst forest you
encounter has the exact same layout
as the Viridian Forest in the original
Pokémon Red and Blue games.
It works. There have been numerous
reports of people on the internet
getting back into the game after not
having played Pokémon for years in
the interleaving period, so much so
that Nintendo announced 4 million
copies of the games being sold over
the release weekend. Pokémon is
huge, and I really hope this helps to
boost the ﬂedgling 3DS ecosystem.
Pokémon Black and White and
their sequels were one of my favourite
games from the series. They broke
new grounds in terms of mechanics
changes, and really brought me into
like the games again. Pokémon X and
Y seems to want to do the same for
an even wider audience, newcomers,
veterans and even people who have
stopped playing the games. It is an
extremely well-reﬁned experience,
aside from some minor complaints..
It feels fresh, and is a very modern
Pokémon game, complete with the
multiplayer connectivity.
If you have ever been remotely
interested in Pokémon before, you
should give it a try. Maybe you’ll like
it and ﬁnd yourself reminiscing about
your younger self playing your ﬁrst
Pokémon game.
