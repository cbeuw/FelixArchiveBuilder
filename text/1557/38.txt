After a poor ﬁrst performance against
UCL last week, IC Rugby’s 1st XV
desperately needed to turn up with
their heads switched on. Playing in the
league against varsity rivals, Imperial
Medics, IC were looking to give them
a repeat performance of last year’s
victory at The Stoop. The atmosphere
in the changing room was charged, to
say the least, with a near emotional
wreck of a captain, Mike O’Connell,
tearfully explaining to the team that
“we do not lose to Medics”. Bearing
that in mind, as well as a few bruises
from Jack Flanagan’s pre-match head-
butts, the team stepped out onto the
pitch to a roar from the crowd of
nearly a dozen spectators. IC kicked to
start, and the game was underway. The
aggression from the oﬀset was much
improved on last week, and after a
few big hits from both the forwards
and the back line it quickly became
clear that the Medics didn’t want to
know. The scoring opened mid-way
through the ﬁrst half with a gazelle-
like Freddie White dancing through
the opposition on a counter attack
from the halfway line. Placing it under
the posts, it was an easy conversion.
It was 7-0 to the College. Falling back
on the team’s strengths, IC crossed the
white line again soon after oﬀ the back
of a driving maul with Tom Hedley
getting the score. Unfortunately, the
conversion attempt bounced back oﬀ
the uprights leaving the scoreboard
at 12-0. A Medic attack brought them
close to the IC line, but a dogged
scramble defence and solid tackling
kept a clean sheet. Pushing back into
the middle of the pitch the crowd went
wild as our prop fresher, Tom, ripped
the ball from a maul to burst up the
pitch on a legendary debut break.
Following this, IC were soon in a
threatening attack position, once more
using the driving maul from a lineout
to score a well-executed set piece try.
Unfortunately, the referee didn’t seem
to agree and the try was questionably
disallowed. Moving into the second
half the game continued at the same
pace. Solid tackling from the entire
team stunted the Medic attack and
despite conceding a penalty within 5
metres of the line, our defensive line
soon pushed them back to 15 metres
out and solid work at the breakdown
resulted in a key turnover. Some
confusion as to what game we were
playing resulted in our back line
booting the ball some 50 metres up
the pitch with great interlinking play
between the wing and centre forward.
However, the ball didn’t quite go to
hand and the opportunity was wasted
with an unlucky knock on 5 metres
from their line. From the back of a
scrum on the Medic’s 10 metre line
a well executed back line move left
1st XV debutant Jon Mann in plenty
of space to burn down the left wing
and score a well deserved try amidst
screams of ‘F**king yes!’ from our vocal
captain. A missed conversion left the
score at 17-0. Further pressure in the
Medic’s half led to yet another driving
maul mildly encouraged from the side
line by IC’s reserved head coach. A
well-organised pack controlled by
Tom Hedley at the back allowed a long
drive up the touchline and a second
score by Hedley in the ﬁnal minutes of
the game. With less than 90 seconds
to go, James Cox calmly took his
time in slotting a diﬃcult conversion
through the middle of the posts from
near the sideline. The ﬁnal whistle
blew with a satisfying ﬁnal score
of 24-0 to Imperial College. After
the cheers subsided and songs were
sung, a night of celebrations ensued;
a ﬁtting evening to award club ties to
the Freshers.
