COMMENT SABB HOT DESK
Another Confesstions of a
Graduate Teaching Assistant.
This week we learn that not all
solutions are soluble...
Kelly-vision!
We’ve unleashed Christy Kelly
onto the world! Read page 9 to
ﬁnd out more!
One of Union Presidentʼs election
manifesto points, the weekly
Sabb Hot Desk has is returning,
new and improved!
The aim of the “Hot Desk” is to
give the students a chance to
talk directly to the Sabbs to give
feedback, ask questions and
resolve issues.
This weekʼs Sabbs are the
Deputy President of Clubs and
Societies and the Felix Editor.
Go and say hi in the Sherﬁeld
Foyer today between 12-13:00.
Happy Halloween
Happy Holla-ween! Next Thursday is Halloween in case you havenʼt
realised! If youʼre to mature to trick-or-treat in the local area and have
managed to escape the Library, why not go to the latest Imperial Fringe
event held in the main entrance from 17-20:00? Conveniently the Unionʼs
Halloween Party starts at 19:00, looks like youʼre already sorted.

Bon Voyage!
