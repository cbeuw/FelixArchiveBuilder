FRIDAY 25 OCT
2012 - BBC closes its last Ceefax page meaning
the world no longer has access to instantaneous,
rolling 24 hour news and sport.
1999-MauricePapon,FrenchNazicollaborator
is jailed a mere 44 years after he actively sought
out and deported French Jews. It later emerges
that this is the fastest the French judicial system
can operate and that, therefore, this is totally
OK.
1964-Jean-Paul Sartre rejects the Nobel Prize in
Literature stating that he feels he is undeserving
and that it should be awarded to Hangman - a
“real quality writer”.
1946 - The UN holds its ﬁrst General Assembly.
This clashes awkwardly with the ﬁrst post-war
meeting of the League of Nations to which only
Canada turns up.
1811 - Argentina declares freedom of the press.
Morons, now I can write whatever the hell I
like about Argentina. What a terrible place, full
of terrible people. Also, Lionel Messi - what a
tosser.
1790 - The Ruskis set up a colony in Alaska.
How fucking original Russia. The whole fucking
world available and you pick the only fucking
piece of cold wasteland left.
1066 - William I wins the Battle of Hastings.
This certainly explains your ﬂuency in French
this week. Those regicidal desires, however, are
all your own. You sick bastard.
Yeah sure, you may have beautiful views Argentina,
but you canʼt fucking grow crops on a glacier. What
a stupid country. Picure credit: destination360.com

Imperial College Remembers Sabrina
A
cross the entire
College, hundreds of
students are continuing
to relive the 1990’s
by remembering that
Sabrina the Teenage Witch was a
television program. After reading
a nostalgic article in a student
newspaper, students raced home
to stream the ﬁrst series online.
And who can blame them? I’m sure
T
he Union intends to
redevelop the West
Basement of Beit Quad,
home to many clubs and
societies, including Jazz and
Rock, Sci-Fi Library, and our beloved
Hangman [Felix]. This would see
many societies moved to make space
for other clubs. The most diﬃcult,
of course, the Table Football Society.
In a shocking twist worthy of M
Night Shymalan himself, the Deputy
President (Financial Services) oﬀered
to host the society in his own oﬃce.
In a statement issued this morning,
he said, “Of course they can have
my space! It’s a great little room, the
door locks, and you can probably
ﬁt two decent-sized tables in there.
I mean, really, what do I need an oﬃce
for? There is no reason I can’t just sit in
the bar on a laptop. Seriously, I spend
most of my time in meetings or the bar
anyway.I’mliterallyneverinmyoﬃce.”
Our reporter Tim McSweeney asked
the DP whether he was serious:
“Sure, why not? They’re not a real club
anyway. I was just using them as an
excuse to set up a Sabbs-only sauna.
So when do we start recording this?”
everyone reading this has fond
memories of coming home from
school, sitting down in front of
CITV, and watching Sabrina ﬁnd
out that its not easy growing up –
even if you do have magical powers.
Even with the entire internet going
crazy for cats, it still amazes Hangman
that people don’t constantly talk
about Salem, the wise-cracking cat.
Well, to be perfectly accurate, he’s
a witch that was turned into a cat,
but you all remembered that, right?
I think we all wish that we had aunts
like Hilda and Zelda when we were

inkley,Somerset - As the
government announces
that the Chinese state
is to have a signiﬁcant
investment in a new
generation of nuclear power stations,
this editor believes that China should
not only have a large stake in our
energy production, but in all areas of
our lives.
Most of our lives consist of random,
uncoordinated actions. With the
directed investment of the People’s
Republic, this time could be spent
buying up American bonds or
bringing Taiwan back into the fold.
Just think, have you not always hated
the Dalai Lama and everything he
stands for? Couldn’t you do without
Japan?
Indeed, this humble writer believes
we, as a nation, could contribute so
much more to the advancement of
humanity if only we put aside our
diﬀerences, and contributed to the
latest ﬁve year plan.
Only with the continued and sustained
investment from the Chinese state can
this country hope to stand on its own
two feet.
So, crack out your Yuan, get rid of
your spare children and move to the
nearest city. We can’t go on like this,
but, thankfully, they’ll cut our deﬁcit,
so we don’t have to.

growing up. You know, one slightly
serious and one fun aunt, although
both of them could go crazy for a
good-looking guy. Remember when
they all made their own artiﬁcial men,
and they made a hunky ﬁreman that
only wants to drink milk? Oh my sides.
So what are you waiting for? Get
online and stream it! Or, you know,
pay for it. Hell, get it on VHS for
that REAL nostalgia. Because if this
generation is good at anything, it’s
reliving 90’s pop culture. In fact,
while you’re at it, crack out the Game
Boy Color; whack some Spice Girls
on the CD player and just go nuts.
