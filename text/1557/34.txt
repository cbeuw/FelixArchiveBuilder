You’re laughing at the poor
quality of these horoscopes
but then you remember that
you edit the failing Imperial
Tab and you shut right up.
Even after you spent
ages telling your friends
hundreds of anecdotes
about Come Dine With
Me, none of them wanted
to come to your dinner
party.
After three unsuccessful
weeks, you officially stop
trying to pull at FemSoc
meetings, and you move on
to trying your luck on the 4th
floor of the library.
This morning, you find the
phone number of that girl
you met in freshers week.
Unfortunately, she’s been
dating your roommate
because you didn’t call.
Another successive week
of low grades makes
you realise that you are
probably not going to
graduate in the same
year as your girlfriend,
and she will meet a
much better guy at the
graduation reception.
You go to Paper Tiger for
the first time and slip on
a puddle of floor grease.
You then have to miss 2
weeks of Rugby training,
which actually partially
restores your liver
function.
You finally work up the
courage to answer a
question in a lecture, only
to say it in a totally different
language that makes
everyone laugh and point.
Your boyfriend asks you to
dress as a sexy cheerleader
for Halloween, but he won’t
dress as a sexy elephant for
you. You leave the party with
another man and don’t look
back.
You will enjoy hearing
about everyone’s plans
for Halloween, while you
secretly decide which
season of game of thrones
you will be masturbating to
that night.
You run into your
estranged father at a
strip club. You excitedly
work out what you’ll say
to him, as soon as he
finishes his set.
You’re editing your
student newspaper two
hours before the deadline
and you haven’t done the
horoscopes, so you have
to call your former lover
Psychic Ron to get you
out of a bind
After overhearing your
crush mention that he
loves magic, you spend
weeks learning a few
tricks and then head to his
flat, only to walk in on him
playing a 4 hour game of
Magic the Gathering.
Ouch.

himself as horse. Are there no depths to
which they will not sink?

Prince Harry Visits

F
ollowing the failure of
the badger culls to kill
the numbers intended,
the Department for
Environment Food & Rural
Aﬀairs was forced to admit it had been
outwitted by the crafty omnivores.
“We just can’t seem to get the upper
hand over them” a spokesperson said
“they’re just too wily”.
At press time, Hangman understands
that Defra has employed the services
of MI5 to attempt to gain a crucial
advantage over the black and white
mammals. However, security services
suspect the badgers have already
anticipated this move and relocated
ther headquarters appropriately. The
war continues.
Solves All Research Problems
A
s Prince Harry visited
Imperial — taking in
the sights and opening
the brand new Blast
Centre — the Royal
also found time to provide useful
pointers and/or completely solve
the research problems faced by the
majority of Imperial academics.
.
Whilst perusing a selection of works
from the Mathematics Department,
the fourthinlinetothethronewasable
to take in the complex computations,
lean over to the researcher in question
and state “the answer’s three”.
His contribution, however, was not
limited to maths . The Prince was also
able to point the way for several life
sciences researchers.
“Have you tried a viral transfection?”
Harry asked one biologist., before
questioning one biochemist “what
about deaminating that shit — that
should give you a deﬁnite answer one
way or the other”.
As he scanned over a presentation
given by the Physics Department, the
Royal Airforce Captain managed to
scribble a quick solution as to why
gravity is such a weak force.
Unfortunately, the Prince was
unable to help the Aeronautics team
understand how the fuck it is planes
ﬂy “It’s fucking crazy” Harry stated
before adding “these objects are really
fucking heavy and yet they can just
ﬂoat there like some kind of cloud?”
“WTF?”
Prince provides the solution to one
of the Millenium Prizes Picture Credit:
