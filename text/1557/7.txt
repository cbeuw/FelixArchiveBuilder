Amrita Ghosh and Arya Mehta explore solutions to sleep deprivation
Can’t sleep? It’s not me, it’s you
AMRITA GHOSH AND ARYA MEHTA
F
riend 1: Isn’t it really diﬃcult
for you to get the books from
the top shelves in the library?
Friend 2: Well I can’t do
much about that, I’ll always
be vertically challenged... because my
mum’s short.
Overhearing a conversation
amongst some freshers in JCR, similar
to the one above, got us thinking
about ourselves. Well it got us
thinking about not only of how much
of a pair of eavesdroppers we are, but
how casually we blame our ‘genes’
for pretty much any undesirable
characteristics we have. But can we
really blame everything about us on
our parents?
Sleep deprivation is a common
problem in many young people. But do
we inherit that from our parents too?
In fact there are proven hypotheses
thatstate‘oursleeppatternisregulated
by genetics’. Scientists have found that
a transcriptional repressor (DEC2)
and a gene (ABCC9) are responsible
to regulate sleep length in mammals.
However this doesn’t mean that if
you are not able to sleep at night, it
is your parents’ fault. Recent studies
show that there are ﬁve other factors
that prevent a sound sleep.
Noise
When living in London noise is
inevitable. Either it is a speeding
Lamborghini in South Ken or the
obnoxious screams of drunken
students late at night — all these are
part of the London life package. These
‘little’ disruptions are one of the prime
causes that prevent a good night’s
sleep. In the ﬁrst stage of sleep, our
body and mind are relaxed. This is a
state between being awake and asleep.
In this state, a part of the brain called
the thalamus prevents information
ﬂow from our senses to the rest of the
brain. However, this system can’t ﬁlter
out noises.
Possible Solution: try to block out
the noise as best as you can by keeping
doors and windows closed. If this
doesn’t remove all the noise, then
plug your headphones in and hear the
sound of waves or rain. This will do
wonders (speaking from experience)!
Light and Dark
It is part of human nature to sleep
when it is dark and to stay awake when
it is light. Light exposure stimulates
a nerve pathway from the retina to
the brain, keeping your brain active.
So it is advisable to stop pulling oﬀ
so many all nighters as you’ll end up
altering your body clock, which will
make it harder for you to fall asleep at
appropriate times.
Possible Solution: good time
management is key to a good night’s
sleep: if you have unﬁnished work it’s
better to wake up early to complete it
rather than spending all night working
strenuously.
Diet
Caﬀeine: when we are tired, it’s very
easy for us to give in to a cup of coﬀee
or a can of red bull to stay awake.
But the eﬀects of caﬀeine from these
products can last in our system for
hours, hence not letting us sleep. In
addition, caﬀeine only promotes the
light sleep and prevents the deep sleep
stage.
Alcohol: after a night out and a peg
or two we feel very drowsy and people
may say that alcohol helps them
fall asleep. But too much alcohol
consumption prevents the ﬁrst
stage of sleep from occurring, which
disrupts the overall sleep cycle; and
therefore it leaves us feeling tired in
the morning. You may not know, but
alcohol causes many people to snore,
which makes it diﬃcult to breath and
thereby prevents comfortable sleep.
Food: a heavy meal at dinner is
another factor that prevents us
from sleeping well. Several types
of food such as spicy food, bacon,
cheese all contain a chemical known
as tyramine, which causes the
release of a neurotransmitter called
noradrenaline. This neurotransmitter
regulates our ‘ﬁght-or-ﬂight’ response
by keeping our body active.
Possible Solution: try to avoid
caﬀeine and alcohol especially at
night as much as possible. You
could replace a cup of coﬀee with
a warm glass of milk instead. Aim

for a light and carbohydrate rich
dinner. Carbohydrates release the
neurotransmitter serotonin, which
makes us feel drowsy.
Body temperature
Coming home from a cold rainy
day (typical London weather!), we
may think that a warm bedroom is
the perfect solution. But when we
sleep our core body temperature
falls; however a warm room makes
it diﬃcult for this process to happen.
This makes you feel uncomfortable
and leaves you battling for sleep.
Possible Solution: Keep your bedroom
well ventilated and avoid turning on
the radiator too much, which will not
only save your bills, but also help you
to sleep better!
A busy mind
Balancing a social and an academic
life is a nightmare for any university
student. Being Imperial students, we
know exactly how busy our minds
always are. Did you know that a busy
mind is sleep’s worst enemy? An
overactive and anxious mind prevents
the body from entering the relaxed
state required to fall asleep.
Possible Solution: Try doing a puzzle
like Sudoku, hangman or crossword
to distract your mind from other
thoughts and then try falling asleep.
Warm baths and showers have also
been proven to relax the mind.
Don’t underestimate the importance
of sleep. Sleep helps us form
memories, and assists us with speech
and reasoning as well as regulates our
mood. So next time you’re struggling
to sleep, it may be your own fault and
not that of your parents’!

A
fter hundreds of years of
hypothesis, the primary
function for sleep
may now have been
discovered. Maiken
Nedergaard and colleagues this week
released a paper detailing how in sleep
the brain clears away waste proteins
linked to neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s that build up in
the space between brain cells.
The recently discovered network of
tiny pathways within the brain that
allow these proteins to be cleared is
called the glymphatic system, similar
to the lymphatic system in the body
that ﬂushes toxic by-products out
of the blood and into the liver. The
pathways circulate cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) into the spaces between cells in
the brain, removing the toxic proteins.
It had been noted before that the
level of these proteins is higher in
awake animals than in sleeping ones,
but that was previously thought to
be because they were produced at a
higher rate when the brain is awake.
This team investigated the alternate
possibility that the glymphatic system
is more active when animals are
sleeping.
They worked with anaesthetised,
awake and sleeping mice, whose CSF
was injected with green dye when their
brain waves indicated that they were
asleep, and red dye when awake. The
path of the dyes through the brain was
then followed, and it was found that
large amounts of CSF were taken into
the brain when the mice were asleep,
but not when awake. Indeed, when the
mice were woken, the inﬂux of CSF
dropped by approximately 95%.
They also tested the clearing of
injected proteins, and found they
cleared twice as quickly when the
mice were asleep. Both of these eﬀects
seem to be due to the channels that
carry the ﬂuid expanding by 60% in
To sleep, perchance to clean (your brain)
asleep and anesthetised mice.
It still remains to be seen whether
the build-up of these toxic proteins
actually regulate sleep — whether
they make you more drowsy the more
of them there are — but this paper
does appear to reveal, at last, one very
important function of sleep.
