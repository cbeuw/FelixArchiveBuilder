Premier League
Predictions
James White
Football Columnist
Chelsea v Man City
(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)
Chelsea may have beaten Cardiﬀ
comfortably on Saturday but still
look far from the ﬁnished article. Jose
Mourinho still doesn’t know his best
team, but will be encouraged by how
his summer signings are performing.
City haven’t improved away from
home since the arrival of Manuel
Pellegrini and are badly missing
Vincent Kompany at the back. They
have to push for a win in games like
this and I wonder if that might just
play into Chelsea’s hands. The Blues
are traditionally strong at home and
know how to win big matches.
Prediction: 2-1
Sunderland v Newcastle
(Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Gus Poyet learnt last weekend
the sheer magnitude of the task he
faces. He has to stop the rot fast, but
will need to summon up some team
spirit because the quality isn’t there.
Newcastle, meanwhile, seem to have
clicked since that shocking ﬁrst half at
Everton last month. They provide the
bigger goal threat and will therefore
be favourites.
Prediction: 1-2
Crystal Palace v Arsenal
(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)
Palace look down and out and
only some Ian Holloway magic can
save their season for me. Arsenal are
on a real roll, are outstanding away
and should win comfortably. Expect
Mezut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey to be
on the scoresheet again.
Prediction: 0-3
Best of the rest
(Saturday 3pm unless stated)
Aston Villa v Everton
Paul Lambert has won more points
away than at home and Villa do
struggle when teams sit back and they
cannot counter. Everton won’t sit back
though and with Lukaku ﬁring this
should be an entertaining contest.
Prediction: 2-2
Liverpool v West Brom
The Sturridge-Suarez partnership
looks excellent but couldn’t see oﬀ
Newcastle last time out. The Baggies
enjoyed their last visit to the North-
West, beating Manchester United,
and have the attacking potency to
cause Liverpool problems too.
Prediction: 1-1
Man United v Stoke
United dropped points again last
weekend and serious questions are
now being asked of David Moyes. But
Stoke, having gone oﬀ the boil after a
ﬁne start and don’t have the strikers to
inﬂict another Old Traﬀord upset.
Prediction: 2-0
Norwich v Cardiﬀ
The Canaries are in a false position
but face an easier run of games
starting this weekend. Sadly for
Cardiﬀ fans, the new owner’s needless
tinkering looks to have undermined
some promising early-season form.
Prediction: 1-0
Southampton v Fulham
The Saints are on a remarkable
run and there’s no reason they can’t
keep going here against a Fulham
side whose attackers simply aren’t
delivering just now. This could be
curtains for Martin Jol.
Prediction: 2-0
Swansea v West Ham
(Sunday 4pm)
West Ham pulled oﬀ some result
in their last away game, beating
Tottenham 3-0, but folded against
Manchester City. Thumping
Sunderland, however, might just have
kick-started Swansea’s season.
Prediction: 1-0
Tottenham v Hull
(Sunday 4pm)
Hull are the season’s surprise
package but defeats at Chelsea,
Manchester City and Everton suggest
they can’t yet challenge top teams.
Spurs should win here.
Prediction: 1-0

Swimming is in!
Last year was great and we are try-
ing to achieve even more in the com-
ing year! We had 29 members, more
than enough to put fantastic routines
together!! Only a few months on and
our members – beginners, intermedi-
ates and advanced – were presenting
their routines at our Christmas show
in the pool of St. Mary’s hospital. This
name is probably familiar to everyone
given that the Royal Baby was born
there. That’s also where our training
sessions take place. So, if you join our
team, you will see the famous hospital.
Add a Harlington grant, some pretty
good RCC funding and a Sport Im-
perial sponsorship and you get some
great new equipment, to make sure
you get ﬁt and your muscles are toned,
and an amazing professional coach, to
get the best teaching ever, whatever
your level!
Last May, six of our members, half
of them beginners, competed in the
French National University Champi-
onship; and just like the year before,
are now happily wearing their bronze
medals. More than a competition, this
was an opportunity for a great week-
end of Synchro and other activities all
together in Bordeaux! We visited the
French city, and discovered a vineyard
as well as a Mexican Navy Boat. We
also spent a couple of days by the sea
to do some open water training and
try fresh seafood. We don’t know yet
where the competition will take place
this year, but we’ll be there and you
can be part of it!
Not everyone wants to commit to
that much training. But everybody
will get the chance to present what
he or she has learned. Last summer’s
show with the teams from Brighton
and London Seymour was very suc-
cessful, attracting over 60 visitors at
Ethos pool. All our members were
able to show their skills and were as-
tonished to see what Synchro elite and
master swimmers can do; and The
Brighton Dolphins convinced every-
one that Synchro can still be enjoyed
after 50! Join us this year and you will
be a part of it. You will also be able
to go to Brighton and swim with the
Brighton Dolphins, enjoy a walk on
the beach, a nice, fresh portion of ﬁsh
and chips, and discover the very fa-
mous Brighton pubs!
Of course Synchro is not just about
swimming; it’s also being part of a su-
per friendly team, with swimmers of
all nationalities, having a great time
in various pubs and restaurants and
trying things you haven’t tried before!
You won’t be getting ﬁt alone in your
gym but having a lot of fun in the pool
with good music and nice people, and
we can promise you will get ﬁtter than
you would have by watching a wall and
running on a treadmill!!
But Synchro does not only help you
to get in shape, joining the team is also
a way to boost your CV. Our commit-
tee is currently run by ﬁnal year PhD
students, so there will be three open
positions very soon, if you want a fun
way to learn essential life skills this is
the place to start! Last year our Club
Chair received the RCC Merit Award
and was nominated as Sports Ambas-
sador of the Year.
IC Synchro can only be successful
with members, so we need you! We
hope to have convinced you that our
club oﬀers a great variety of activities.
If you want more information you
can contact us via email: syncswim-
ming@imperial.ac.uk or check our
website: www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/
synchroswimming. And don’t hesi-
tate to come to any of our sessions on
Thursday evenings from 18.30 to 20.30
in St Mary’s swimming pool! Your ﬁrst
session is free and our membership
is only £7. But, seriously, you want to
have fun? You want to become ﬁt and
strong? You want to meet new great
people? Then IC Synchro is for you!
