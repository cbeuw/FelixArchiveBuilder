Regius
Professor
I
mperial conferred its ﬁrst Regius
Professorship on Professor Chris
Toumazou on Commemoration
day for undergraduate students
on 23 October.
Imperial received the title of Regius
Professor of Engineering in January
during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee
celebrations; which was received for
the work undertaken by Imperial’s
faculty of Engineering and the
technological breakthroughs it has
achieved. Examples of breakthroughs
range from the development of
magnetic levitation to the invention of
holography.
Imperial conferred the recognition
on Professor Toumazou. He is an
internationally renowned engineer;
his achievements include the ﬁrst
cochlear implants that allow deaf
people to hear.
ProfessorToumazousaid:“Receiving
the very ﬁrst Regius Professorship
at Imperial is an incredible honour.
The award acknowledges so many
historic contributions to the ﬁeld of
Engineering by Imperial researchers
over many years. In particular the
ﬁeld of circuits and systems where
engineering solutions to medical
problems has now become a core
area of research. Having it conferred
on me during Commemoration
Day, in front of my family and
thousands of graduates, makes it
all the more special. Today is a day
which celebrates both achievement
and future potential, as so many
gifted students from all disciplines
mark their transition into their future
careers. When I think about what
lies ahead in my research ﬁeld it’s
incredibly exciting to be reminded of
all of that talent and to consider what
contributions today’s graduates will
make to shape the future of science
and engineering and medicine.”
The Dean of the Faculty of
engineering, Jeﬀ Magee said, “I am
delighted we are able to honour
Chris in this way. As a pioneer in the
ﬁeld of biomedical engineering, his
achievements are extensive. Alongside
becoming Imperial’s youngest ever
professor at 33, he has published over
750 research papers and holds more
than 50 patents, with inventions to his
name that have transformed medical
treatments and had a profound eﬀect
on people’s lives.
“The Regius Professorship recognises
the world-class quality and impact of
Engineering at Imperial College and
Chris Toumazou is a very worthy ﬁrst
recipient of this prestigious title.
”
Sir Keith O’Nions, Imperial’s
President and Rector congratulated
the new students and said:
“Your talents and educational
experience mean you are well set to
tackle head on the big challenges in our
increasingly complex world.
It is often said that Imperial’s
reputation is built by its alumni – they
are our greatest ambassadors. I have
no doubt that the accomplishments
of this year’s graduating students will
be at least as great as those who have
preceded you and wish you the very
best for the future”.
