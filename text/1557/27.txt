The new 3D graphics (when I say
3D, I mean the 3D models you see in
games, not the stereoscopic 3D you
get in a 3DS) would be the ﬁrst thing
that someone would notice when they
pick up the game. For the ﬁrst time in
the game’s history (only considering
the main series of games and not their
spin-oﬀs), Pokémon are no longer just
2D sprites with some extra frames for
rudimentary animations — they are
now living, breathing creatures who
move around during battle scenes
when you are idle. They squirm in
pain when they get hit, and they dance
when they are happy.
The overworld is also now in
glorious and beautiful 3D. Cities
and towns actually feel alive with
people who move around and you
can eavesdrop on their conversations
if you so wish. The camera swoops
arounds with diﬀerent camera angles
as you move around the cities and
routes, highlighting the amazing
aesthetics that Game Freak has added
to the cities. One of the caves only
allows traversing with an over-the-
shoulder look, giving it more of a
mysterious nature without the usual
top-down approach. This was ﬁrst
featured in Pokémon Black and White,
but with the game now moving onto
better graphics with the 3DS, it looks
way better. With the game set in the
Kalos region modelled after France, it
is not surprising to ﬁnd some French
knockoﬀs in the game. There is a
tower in the middle of the largest city
that is obviously a copy of the Eiﬀel
Tower, and there is also a clone of the
Versaille Palace in the game.
Random encounters with Pokémon
in the game are also more varied.
You can now walk across grass ﬁelds,
shallow water, and even have Pokémon
leap out of bushes or the sand to
ambush you. In caves, Pokémon can
even swoop down from the ceiling
to attack you. Some people may
really hate such random encounters
prevalent in typical Japanese games;
the variety of such encounters seem
to have alleviated the frustration, and
I actually look forward to having some
encounters.
The music in the game sounds really
amazing. I really liked the various
battle themes. The cities and towns
have music that seems to emphasise
the beauty aspects of them, and is
just really pleasing to listen to. I
usually have the volume slider on my
3DS turned all the way up when I am
playing at home. I should also note
that the music sounds diﬀerent from
previous games, with a change in the
style of the music.
For the ﬁrst time in the series, the
player is able to customise his or her
appearance. You can buy clothes,
and change your hairstyle and your
accessories like your bag and hat. This
is all done in the name of being stylish,
which is also a gameplay mechanic
that allows you access to some of the
locations in the game.
In ages past, battles mostly looked
like two Pokémon sprites moving
laterally on a screen, and blinking
when they get hit. Well, not any
more. Battles feel very much alive
in Pokémon X and Y. While the
player decides on his next move, the
Pokémon on the ﬁeld will breathe,
idle around, and even turn around
to look at the player for directions.
When the attacks are exchanged, they
will actually move in a way that is
consistent with what the attack is. For
example, if it wants to shoot a Hyper
Beam, it might actually open its mouth
and shoot a beam. When Pokémon get
hit, they will squirm and grimace. Just
like in Pokémon Black and White, the
game camera will also pan around the
battleﬁeld, giving you an immersive
experience while you battle.
Unfortunately, it also seems that
Game Freak might have gone a bit
too far in terms of maximising and
utilising the 3DS graphics capabilities
in this game. Stereoscopic 3D is not
always used consistently in the game. It
only manifests in cut scenes, and only
in single one on one battles. In battles,
you could literally see the framerate of
the game drop and lag when you have
stereoscopic 3D turned on. Even with
stereoscopic 3D turned oﬀ, battles
sometimes lag as well. This gets worse
in a triple battle.
The stories of the Pokémon games
have really never been a draw. They are
the same. Pokémon Black and White
and their sequels actually made a stark
improvement in terms of the storyline
being slightly more interesting and
diﬀerent.
The story is typical. When you start
the game, the game asks if you are a
boy, or a girl. You make your choice,
enter your name and then you are
a thrown into your bedroom. You
are a newbie in town who is given a
Pokédex by some professor who then
sends you oﬀ on a journey to complete
it. You are called to investigate some
mystery about mega-evolution
(mechanics described below). At
the same time, you collect eight gym
badges to complete in the Pokémon
league, and become the champion
after challenging the elite four. You
also encounter some evil organisation.
They are just called Team Flare in
this game. It is all the same. If you’ve
played any of the games, you’ve heard
of the story. It is actually a regression
compared to Pokémon Black and
White. It raises some interesting
adult themes of overpopulation and
resource scarcity, but they never really
get developed.
In games past, you would usually
have one (and then two) rivals in the
game who aid you on your quest. This
time, you get four, three of whom are
really annoying. They get in the way,
say silly things, and just babble on and
on. I think Game Freak intended to
make the whole journey seem less of
a solo experience, but I don’t think it
worked for me. Perhaps that’s because
I am old and cynical.
The only one who is bearable and
even slightly likeable is your actual
rival who is the gender that you
did not choose when making your
character, but they suﬀer from really
low self esteem and say extremely self-
deprecating things when you defeat
them. What am I supposed to do? I
can’t progress if I don’t defeat you,
and yet you say such depressing things
that really make your character rather
unlikeable, and diﬃcult to empathise
with.
I
n the 17 years since the ﬁrst
Pokémon games were released,
Game Freak have been
churning out generations of
iterative games, each improving
upon their predecessors gradually.
Now in its sixth generation of the
games, Pokémon X & Y delivers
another more-of-the-same but
greatly improved game from its
predecessor Pokémon Black 2 and
White 2. I played Pokémon Y, but
the diﬀerences between the versions
are slight, and do not involve any
gameplay mechanics. This review
will contain spoilers, although not
story related ones.
