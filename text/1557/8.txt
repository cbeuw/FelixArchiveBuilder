Boris: Resolute Vertebrate Jelly Part I
T
he mayor for London, Boris
Johnson,madetheheadlines
in February of this year after
deeming members of the
London Assembly as “great
supine protoplasmic invertebrate
jellies” for failing to interrogate him
over revisions to the £16.5 bn budget.
The characteristic neologism merely
capped his voluminous arsenal of
quips and redeeming facets. He is,
by far, the most popular politician in
The Conservative Party at present.
A March 2013 poll carried out
by the London Evening Standard
claimed that he would obliterate
Ed Miliband in the polls if he were
to (hypothetically) succeed David
Cameron as party leader. His broad
and endearing appeal to the people of
London is extensive, being re-elected
with a 44% mandate over Labour’s
Ken Livingstone.
It has become increasingly apparent
to me that Boris Johnson’s political
machinations often proceed without
inhibition. As an indiﬀerent freshman
I voted him back into power in 2012,
purely on a whim of popularity. This
dawned on me eighteen months later
when a friend commented with vitriol
that he simply,
“doesn’t get the phenomena that
is Boris Johnson. Londoners blindly
tolerate his mayorship despite him
being a blatant right-wing arsehole.”
My view of Boris Johnson isn’t as
extreme. In fact an ethereal veil of
guilt envelops me when I criticise him
at all. I want to examine the reasons
for his apparent immunity to criticism
in context of his policies.

London’ covered a lot of ground

for a manifesto during the 2012
election campaign. Its appeal spanned
all societal thresholds. Foreign
investment bankers, migrant workers
and local Londoners alike were able
to empathise with its ﬁscal rectitude.
Cuts to city hall in excess of £3.5 bn
simultaneously implied that Boris
Johnson intended to inhibit any
unnecessary bureaucracy while
delivering more for Londoners. The
ability to demonstrate apt ﬁnances for
thelatterprovedpivotalinoverturning
Ken Livingstone of Labour. The
complementary freezing of the
Mayoral share of council tax bolstered
Mr. Johnson’s resolve. Crucially, the
£445 return for the taxpayer may have
provided comfort to Londoners on the
bottom rung of the income ladder.
The binary pledge of creating
200,000 jobs by 2015 with a £221
million investment in small business
wasambitious.Itsuniversalappealwas
again apparent. This championing of
capitalism may have served to appease
not only the ﬁnancially endowed but
also the jobless and working classes.
In an analogous fashion his support
of strong policing, combined with a
pledge for green space restoration,
encompassed two fulcrums in the
lives of those who live in a city. Safety
and health are chief priorities for all
citizens. By demonstrating that city
hall’s sympathies were congruent with
those priorities Boris Johnson made a
smart move. He managed to decouple
his integrity as a man from his
capitalist politics. It was of perennial
importance that Boris Johnson
distanced himself from Downing
Street. Ken Livingstone was always
conveyed as thoroughly enmeshed
with his labour politics. This skew,
albeit slight, may have contributed to
his downfall at the polls.
I conclude with a note on Boris’
approach to transport. His pledge to
service improvement on the tubes,
expansion of the ‘Boris Bike’ scheme,
when underpinned by ﬂedgling
projects such as Crossrail and
unwavering support for an airport
on the Thames estuary, conveyed a
steadfast sense of resolve. To warp
his own words he is, undoubtedly,
a vertebrate. As I’ll attempt to
demonstrate next week he’ll need to
be dynamic and ﬂuid as mayor in the
coming years. Rising rail fares, a ﬂat-
pack Olympic legacy and the ‘plebgate’
debacle are clear evidence for this.

Confessions of a GTA: Part 3
I
was really looking forward to my
teachingclasswiththeﬁnalyears.
At last these were people that did
not care if you did not know the
answer of the top of your head as
long as you tell them what the heck is
going on or at least what should be. I
think this is something to do with the
Fear. This is that feeling you get before
your exams that makes you start
studying ridiculously early and freak
out went you ﬁnd out one of your
classmates is studying for 12 hours
a day. Don’t get me wrong, the ﬁrst
years are lovely but the Fear ﬁlls them.
I think this causes irritating questions
like “Is it ok if I use a blue pen in the
exam?” Or worrying questions such
as “How do you add up in Excel?” and
also the crazy questions. My favourite
of these was one fresher marching up
to a lecturer, who is eminent in his
ﬁeld, and insisted that a question on
the tutorial sheet was wrong because
he had done three pages of working
and the solution he had found was
impossible…
The ﬁnal years do not have the Fear.
They are either too exhausted or too
beaten down to care. These are the
people who will, on hearing an MSc
student complaining they’d been in
the computer room for two days and
their social life was ruined, yell across
the room “Welcome to Imperial”, or
when ﬁnding out that they are getting
another lab on top of six courseworks
and an essay will just laugh.
However, this all changed when I
had a look at their practical sheet. All
I could think was “this is really hard!!!
“It was not like this four months ago
when I was there. The Fear did hit
me then, sadly for the ﬁrst time in
years. How was I going to walk into
a room and not be able to explain the
question? It was bad…
I walk into the lecture theatre and
march towards the lecturer only to
get sidetracked, but I could answer
this question. Relief ﬁlls me when all
I have to do is explain the method. I
happily do this for the next half hour.
Only to ﬁnd then that all the students

great asset of this is to
keep things simple, easy to manage,
and reduce variables to a minimum.
An example of this is “you’re either
with me, or you’re against me”.
This dichotomy seems fairly
straightforward(ifalittleintimidating).
This statement intimidates and
coerces up until the point that we
realise that the dichotomy is in fact,
false. The position of neutral ground
is a perfectly logical one, which the
statement avoids in order to carry
through its eﬀect.
The use of false dichotomy is one
that seems to constantly crop up in
daily life, yet it is very infrequently
noticed, forgotten as people make an
exclusive decision and move on.

had got the same answer that I had
found previously, but was wrong. How
was this happening? I look around
desperately for the lecturer who slinks
out of the door to leave me alone with
a class full of vaguely irritated and
tired students. So, forced into a corner
I committed the number one GTA sin
of showing the students the answer.
(Yes I know…)
Half way through a complex and
wildly imagined theory of how you
could do it, the lecturer saunters up
to tell me the question is wrong… So
maybe that’s the key of GTAing. The
Fear is gone but perhaps we need the
craziness of the ﬁrst years to stand up
and say that they think it is wrong,
even to the cleverest people we know.
of action because their personal
preferences seemed mutually
exclusive. Great nights out stalled,
deals failed, relationships broken,
or never even begun when often
the perceived dichotomy was totally
bogus.
Many false dichotomies seem to
ﬁnd their roots in people’s own beliefs
and assumptions. Usually they are
exacerbated when said people don’t
question their beliefs critically and on
a regular basis.
To take another example: “A student
must choose two of theses option at
Imperial: social life, good grades, or
sleep”. Daniel chose sleep.
