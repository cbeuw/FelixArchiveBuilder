Bluebells
ring In
New Year
The New Year's Party is never an easy gig
for any band with a large proportion of
the audience being at the venue for the
first time and still suffering from culture
(or lack of culture) shock. Dancing does
not come easily. Also this was the best
organised New Year's Party for at least
four years with both bands competing
against two discos and other entertain-
ments which also attracted large crowds.
Support band Magic Box had come
from Scotland looking for a record deal.
Although their music was highly dance-
able almost everybody stood still and
their similarity to Simple Minds in both
sight and sound may well work against
them in the future. Nevertheless they re-
ceived a deserved encore.
The Bluebells are also Scottish and
play a much more straight forward ver-
sion of rock'n'roll with two guitars and
plenty of harmonica and tambourine.
Thankfully they beefed up their sound
from their last single, the Alan Tarney
produced Sugar Bridge (Tarney also pro-
duces Leo Sayerand Cliff Richard) which
on record was as sweet and insubstantial
as its title but live was given a much more
satisfying and boisterous treatment.
Tarney was brought in when their first
two singles Forever More and Cath failed
to get beyond the lower reaches of the
Top 75 but his production methods were
no more successful and their debut al-
bum, which is due for release early in the
new year, will be produced by C o l i n
Townley (producer of Costello's Pills and
Soap).
A welcome change of pace was The
Patriots Game, a song by Dominic Behan
(brother of the late Irish author Brendan)
about a young man joining the IRA. Sung
in a slow and regretful voice it is a moving
case of disillusionment when the ends
don't justify the means.
Although receiving a better reaction
than the support, the band were obvious-
ly disappointed by the audience whom
they later said were "a bit dead".
Their main drawback is that they just
want to be a pop group. This has virtually
become a two-horse race between the
coiffured and costume pop of England
and the much more talented sound of
young Scotland.
Ironically signed to London records
(formerly Decca) the Bluebells are well
on their way to success with an American
tour coming up. They're signed to Warner
Brothers in A m e r i c a and have gained
m u c h e x p e r i e n c e s u p p o r t i n g E l v i s
Costello and Nick Heyward.

Catch that Train
It is highly surprising that Clint Eastwood and General Saint are not household
names already. As far back as the riots of 1981 their single Another one bites the
dust was a cult favourite and enjoyed great success in the independent charts.
This coupled with their dynamic stage show (backed by the Inity Brothers and
seen on television at the end of 1981) has made them critical favourites and their
last album Stop That Train enjoyed rave reviews but again managed only
independent success.
The excellent title track was released as a single being one of several
revamped old songs on the album which were complemented by biting political
songs about nuclear war and police harassment.
The duo have evolved from straight forward 'toasting' to include wider
influences and although this has angered some reggae purists, it should lead to
a memorable performance tonight. Other attractions include the Neutron
Hurricane Force Steel Band and a West Indian disco late into the night.
