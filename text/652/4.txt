Imperial Solution
to an Imperial
Problem

A girl in the audience called him a
fascist bastard, he called himself
simple, but nobody called him
speccy-foureyes. In the end,
either by accident or design, Tim
Williams (RSMU Vice-Pres)
proved himself quite clever by
sinking another motion on porn-
ography. The trick was amazing-
ly simple—have an amendment
to a motion passed, you are then
considered the proposer and can
withdraw it. The only fault was
that the amendment should not
have been allowed in the first
place since it was put before the
motion proposed. This was all
the fault of Ian Bull (one minus
mark already in his Presidential
campaign) who took the chair
after the original chairman, the
terribly busy John Passmore had
to leave.
Despite his broad Irish accent
Passmore managed his part of the
meeting very well—starting off
by quickly running through the
Standing Orders. He didn't say
they had to be obeyed (and they
weren't). His chairmanship was a
strange mix of egoism and
modesty—wearing the very ex-
clusive Union General Award tie
whilst at the same time not
mentioning he was Chairman of
ULU General Union Council
during the election of delegates to
that committee.
We even had the honour of
Passmore interpreting for the
even more Irish Sean Davis who
pronounced Eros —E-row-us
and might as well have been
talking about Keady High St
when mentioning tiddlywinks
down Oxford St (next Saturday).
In the complex procedural
wrangling during the porn mo-
tion, they would have appreci-
ated the comments of a girl
during a recent amendment on
abortion in Ireland 'F*** the
amendment'.

Does anyone really want
Martin S Taylor's FELIX?
Did you enjoy FELIX last year? Did anything happen that you want
to remember? Did you miss your Captain Lindley dress-up doll at
Christmas? If the answer to all of these questions is no, don't neglect
to order an edition of last year's FELIX-it's still quite useful for holding
up short table legs, biffing noisy neighbours and invaluable as a
concentrated source of material for paper planes.
If you are interested, please enquire at the FELIX Office for further
details, or fill in the form below:
The price is a mere £15.50 and the amount for post and packing is
available from the FELIX Office.
Please, please, please send me a bound edition of FELIX with my
name lavishly embossed on it in gold leaf. I enclose the trivial sum of
£15.50 in the form of a cheque/postal order/cash.

Sally Pillbrow, a first year
mathematician, is the new RCS
Queen of Jez. She was elected at
Monday's U G M where the con-
testants were required to prove
how "successfully and stylishly
you can polish your brass
nozzles". Only Sally won by
polishing brass buttons!
Sally hails from Reading where
she's got a boyfriend of three
year's standing. If that wasn't
enough to ruin any self-
respecting male's chances she
lives a life of luxury at Hughes
Parry Hall over at Russell
Square!
She looks forward to getting
involved in Dramsoc and Canoe
Club. She likes singing too,
particularly in the bath!
Sally is destined to bemuse
RCS with her unique ability to do
charades with her tongue!
Tradition dictates that the
RCS President takes the Queen of
Jez out to dinner. So what advice
can Sally offer Eric Darbyshire so
that he gets it just right. She likes
going out to dinner, provided its
terribly romantic and done with
all the trimmings (eg dressing up,
roses). A Chinese restaurant
would be ideal.
So a demanding lady who has
found the first week a little
overwhelming, although it wasn't
"so much chaos and shambles as
I'd been led to believe."
