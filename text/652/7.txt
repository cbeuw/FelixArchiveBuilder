FELIX Apology
FELIX would like to apologise to IC
Choir. It seems that the advertisement
Choir submitted to the Fresher's issue was
deliberately sabotaged by persons
unknown. We deeply regret that, owing to
pressures of work, we did not detect this
until after printing. In order to make
amends, we are printing the advertisement
in its original form free of charge.

David Tightman ran up to the floppy
and chained it straight into the 48K
R A M available on his Atari 800. The
screen blanked and then lit up with
the following message:
Your'e not F-king well trying to
log into N O R A D again?
'Sheesh!' D a v i d groaned and
typed in Y E S . These damn com-
puters are getting too smart for their
own good, he thought, peevishly.
The computer replied:
Jeezus Christ, kid. Well if that's
what you want...
David smiled as he logged on and
then frowned as there was a knock
on the door. 'Dave?' Jennifer's
seductive voice came from the other
side of the d o o r , ' C o m i n g to
Bladerunner on Tuesday 6:30 pm
Mech Eng 220?" David sighed, if
only girls were more like computors,
just program them to do what you
wanted instead of all this necking,
ugh! 69 perhaps....He was dist-
taccted by the screen.
Press return to initiate full scale
nuclear war.
He paused, fate of the world at his
fingertips. Thre was Jenifer-at the
thought of her young body he
clutched his terminal witha sudden
intensity. Then the fire of lust died in
his eyes.
What the hell, David thought, this
was more fun than s c r e w i n g .

Overseas Chinese
Education

voluntary organisation financially supported
by the Hong Kong Government Office and
ILEA. It consists of an independent admini-
strative body currently managing four estab-
lishments which are located in Euston,

In the new year to come, we require every

WLC
The West London Chaplaincy is a group of
Christians from various churches who meet
every Sunday for a Communion Service in the
Consort Gallery, Sherfield Building at
10:00am followed by an informal get-
together over coffee and maybe lunch.
We also meet in smaller groups in the Halls
and Departments over breakfast or lunch to
share friendship and a meal and talk over
those parts of life computers cannot reach.
These meetings lead to weekends in the coun-
tryside, journies to foreign parts, and carol
singing in the Albert Hall (vestibule).
There will be a new students party on
Monday 10 October in the Bot/Zoo Com-
mon Room inside the Beit Arch, at 7:30pm, to
which everyone is welcome.
The first weekend out of London is at
Gerrards Cross 28-30 Oct. The summer pil-
grimage is going to Assisi by Landrover.
Start saving now!
