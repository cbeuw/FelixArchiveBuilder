As the Karmic Wheel of Academia revolves another week of
What's On hoves into view. To enliven this event horizon of
Imperial it's an idea if those of you who make entries to What's
On include a photograph, illustration, logo or cartoon to lend
excitement to this, the most important page in FELIX. It'll also
get the punters going to your event. The deadline for What's On
from now on is Monday 1:00pm.
