Right
Dear Pallab
Your subversive left wing
tendencies and your corrupt
unscrupulous methods have
long been apparent. As a
representative of IC's silent
majority I implore you to cease
your totalitarian control of the
letters page. We have turned a
blind eye to your associations
with shady, bankrupt printing
firms. The whole of IC has
laughted at your definition of
racism, under which a non-
racist country ought to pay for
the education of the rest of the
world. Consoc has put up with
the deliberate, and systematic
sabotage of its handbook.
However the last straw was a
fake article printed under Con-
soc in last week's FELIX. If I
named the most obvious sus-
pects, I would undoubtedly be
accused of 'racism' or 'sexism',
or antipathy towards your
'carefully selected ethnic minor-
ity news team'. Whilst I realise
that there is little chance of this
letter being printed, I must at
least try to appeal to the vestiges
of your conscience.
Yours upstandingly
Jonathan Gerson
Consoc Chairman
PS: The bit in the fake article
about Soc Soc being the place
for whingeing snivelling little
bastards wasn't too bad.
My sincere apologies, Jonathan.
I thought it was unusual for a
Consoc article. It was so well
written and amusing.-Ed.

Speaks Out
Dear Pallab
I am writing concerning the
IC Union Handbook which I
have just read. To clarify
matters to the recent arrivals at
College, to whom the Hand-
book was sent, the Handbook
Editor was Adrian James, the
previous news editor on
FELIX. I would hope he has
not benefitted from the excel-
lence of reporting and intrigue
for which FELIX is always
advertised. I suspect that a large,
part of the Handbook was not
edited by Mr James but written
Page2 MMMMHHMHM1
by him, and through this, the
emphasis and accuracy of the
information, when related to
the medium may be question-
able. I would refer you to the
article on bars: re Southside
"Most students take their
drinks to the Upper Lounge."
This is an obvious factual
inaccuracy when calculated on
pure numbers; if however it
refers to Mr James' friends then
that is conceivable. Re the
Union Bar: "This is where most
of the heavy drinking in College
goes on. On Barnights (organ-
ised by CCUs and various
College drinking clubs) this
place should be avoided. At all
other times it is bearable."
Digest for a moment; I will
return to the inaccuracies but
first to the empahsis. This
College has seen a dramatic
decline in the standard and
fortunes of the Union Bar over
the past five years. It used to
contain many people on every
evening and was full at least
three times a week. The bar's
quintessential flavour was gen-
erated by the number of people
and the character of those
people who used it. This does
not mean that barnight be-
haviour was the norm for
every night, nor would one
wish it to be so; though it was
certainly not the place for those
wishing to discuss the aesthetic
properites of a pile of bricks
over two hours and a half of
bitter shandy.
The decline has been due to
the increase in pressure on
students related to work and
employment, the increase in
entrance standards and hence
the change in the balance of
characters (not individuals but
types) at College and the bar
management. The various rela-
tive influences of these factors I
leave to other people. I feel we
would do no one a service by
dissuading them from entering
the Union Bar; as a student bar
the union is entering its death
throws, and as such we should
encourage its resurrection, by
increased • custom. I would
suggest the very times Mr James
advocates attendance, when it is
populated by workmen, scaf-
folders, builders, estates and a
few 'train spotters' perhaps the
odd orchestra, is the very time
to put people off; if they have
received the understanding that
this is the better side and true
nature of the Union Bar. I
would concede that occasions
such as bar nights are also not
to be treated as the average or
the best. Let the Union revert to
the full, lively knock-about bar
that it was of yesteryear;
releasing the others to serve the
customers for which they were
intended.
Returning to the accuracy of
the quote. I think I understand
those to whom he incorrectly
alludes as 'drinking clubs';
though it is certain they have
never organised a 'bar night'. If
they had, and half of that
which is attributed to them was
true, coupled with their perc-
eived false reputations, it would
have been an event which might
have caused a holocaust to
worry even C N D . Further,
with the RSMU's preference
for Southside, I doubt that
most of the heavy drinking is
now done in the Union.
To those reading the Union
Handbook I would suggest
caution in accepting Mr James'
view of College and would
encourage them to find out for
themselves, with an open mind.
Yours

A Likely
Tail
Dear Pallab
I feel I must tell your readers
about Mooney's excellent meals
service. The shepherd's pie
must be tried, full of good
meaty nourishment, though I
was disappointed by the lack of
marrowbone variety.

FELIX
Exposed
Dear Pallab
Congratulations on your
Freshers' FELIX—an excellent
production. It lacked only one
thing, the gratuitous use of
nipples.

Corrupt and
Self Seeking
Dear Pallab
Congratulations on producing
your first two issues of FELIX.
However, I must say that your
present campaign against
Michael Arthur is disgraceful.
Some of the things you have said
in the course of it are tantamount
to suggesting that not only is he
arrogant, unhelpful and with no
interest in the problems of
ordinary students but also that he
is a right poofter. Both these
charges are as false as they are
disgraceful. (Mind you I couldn't
help laughing at the last one.)
I was further surprised when,
in your vacation issue of FELIX,
you described last year's dedi-
cated and hard working Union
President Stephen Goulder as
"corrupt and self-seeking". Have
you changed your opinion since
you proposed him for for this
post last year, or are you wilfully
and knowingly responsible for
inflicting, in the light of your own
words, such an unsuitable person
on the Union?
Yours sincerely
J Martin Taylor
