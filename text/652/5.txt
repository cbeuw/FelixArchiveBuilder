Z)r Simon Perry Chairman of
Refectories Committee
writes in reply to the
criticisms of the College
refectories in the IC Union
Handbook.
Nobody ever seems to cons-
ider the problems posed by
cooking and serving some-
thing like 500,000 meals a
year. Dozens of nationalities
and religions, changing eating
habits, kitchens and refec-
tories designed 30 years ago
for supplying breakfast, meat
and two veg twice a day.
Finding staff to work highly
irregular hours and seasons.
All within a framework of
keeping prices down in an age
when all the 'traditional'
subsidies have disappeared. .
Despite this, the demandfor
meals at Imperial College
necessitatesfour main student
refectories, at least twice as

many as any other London
college. This permits a degree
of variety which it is hoped to
improve significantly during
the coming year;firstly,with
freshly cooked pitta-bread
kebabs and salad (Union),
cooked to order omelettes and
grills (Southside evenings),
more varied sandwiches and
filled French rolls (newly
refurbished JCR Buttery);
secondly, by appointing (we
hope) an additional chef—a

Opinion
Notwithstanding, you may
not Jike the first College
refectory you eat in—then try
the next! If you don't like any
of them, please tell us why
(constructively, svp). The
staff/student suggestions and
complaints committee (con-
tacted in writing by way of the
wall-mounted boxes in refec-
tories) considers every
comment or criticism and,
whenever practicable or
appropriate, takes action on
your behalf.
It is only natural to try
outside eating places —
different surroundings,
different styles of food, even
for the exercise. Nonetheless,
the College Refectory system
is run entirely for the benefit
of staff and students; it is
entirely reliant on your
support. Please try it; after all,
can the eaters of 500,000
meals a year be entirely
wrong?
