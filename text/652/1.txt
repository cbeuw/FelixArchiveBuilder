FAULTY FREMANTLE
Up to twenty freshers are getting their first taste of College
life by being forced to accept unsafe and substandard accommoda-
tion in the Fremantle Hotel.
A report on the hotel by the
College Estates Section re-
vealed that rooms were rid-
dled with dry rot and rain
water was seeping into rooms
on the top floor through the
roof. The damp in some
rooms was so bad that mould
and fungi was growing on the
walls.
The poor state of repair of
the Fremantle was bought to
the attention of Michael
Arthur, Student Services
Officer, as early as July. M r
Arthur asked the landlords of
the Fremantle to make the
necessary repairs but nothing
was done for four months.
With the start of term rapidly
approaching College put fur-
ther pressure on the landlords
by threatening to withdraw
from the Fremantle and even-
tually hurried repairs were
made.
Mr Arthur settled for what
many people involved with
the Fremantle see as a totally
botched job. A number of
cosmetic repairs were rushed
by the landlords in just two
days. The damp and dry rot
had merely been painted over
and alterations to the roof
were next to useless.
Matters were so bad that
last week I C U President
Gaynor Lewis did not want
students to be put into the
rooms. However she was
persuaded against her better
judgement by Michael Arthur
to rent the substandard ac-
commodation to students des-
perate for somewhere to live.
The hotel was leased to Col-
lege last year by the Astor
Hotel group with the know-
ledge that there were a num-
ber of faults. Despite this the
Hotel was taken because it
was felt that it provided
reasonably cheap and con-
venient accommodation for
students. It seems the gamble
has not paid off with some
quite serious structural faults
coming to light.
An authoritative source in
the Estate Section said that
the cosmetic repairs made by
the landlords would not last
more than a few weeks, the
approaching cold weather
and rain would restart the
same problems.
