And now, a whole article without one mention
of the word 'fresher'. Well over half of the
students at IC join a sports society, and last
year, there were over a thousand that played
for a team regularly. If you're like me, you
won't have seen much of the Freshers' Fair
apart from the Real Ale stall. The Sports
Column is the place where you can And out
which clubs are lunatic enough to let you join
them.
A note for people writing reports now. If I'm
short of room, the boring ones will be left out.
No lists of teams and: "Pete didn't play well
because he stirred his coffee clockwise by
mistake at breakfast." I want some incisive wit
this year. (Look it up!) Photographs are also a
good idea (black and white), especially as it'll
take me less time to do' the page.
A message to the Cricket Club. Pallab
wouldn't let me use a whole copy of FELIX for
your tour report, but I'm considering serial-
ising it!
Copy for reports should arrive by 5:00pm
Monday at the latest.
