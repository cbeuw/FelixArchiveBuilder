Mick Gets the Boot Rape Alarm
The Executive Committee of IC
Union has overturned a decision
by Deputy President Christine
Teller to charge a £4 deposit for
all rape alarms.
Union Council policy is to
issue rape alarms to any woman
who wishes to have one. Since
there was no provision in Union
funds for this kind of expendi-
ture, Miss Teller decided to
charge a £4 deposjt to those re-
quiring a rape alarm. The deposit
would be refunded when the rape
alarm was returned.
The objection at the Exec
meeting was raised by Mike
Stuart Guilds President since he
felt that her action was going dir-
ectly against Council policy.
Miss Teller will now not be
ordering any more rape alarms
since she feels that she cannot
find the money to pay for them.
There have been ten cases of rape
and violence against women
reported over the past fourteen
months in Notting Hill, a mere
two miles from College. Most
alarmingly three rapes have
occured in the last eight weeks.
Police activity has been
stepped up in the area, but this
may, unfortunately, mean that
the rapist may change his
territory. So far the police only
have a vague description of the
'Beast of Kensington'. His
victims could hardly be described
as careless about security, so
there is extra reason for extreme
vigilance.
The rapist's acts have certainly
struck a real fear and anxiety in
the women of Notting Hill. Let us
hope he is soon caught.
Linstead Hall Warden Dr Richard Clarke and Subwarden
Raj Chandra are pressing College to reconsider what they believe
is an insensitive and rigid application of rules over the messengers
system.
The Ents Mafia
They are dismayed that a
month ago the Hall messenger,
Mr Mick Saul, was suddenly
transferred to the Beit Quad-
rangle. Mr Saul had been Lin-
stead messenger for the last year.
Dr Clarke said that in this time he
had done an excellent job. His
efforts not only saved the War-
dens and Housekeeper consider-
able amounts of time, but made
the students feel very much at
home.
Mr Saul was moved in a
periodic reshuffling of respon-
sibilities in the messenger service.
This is a regular procedure
according to the Chief Security
Officer, Mr Geoffrey Reeves, so
that each messenger has detailed
knowledge of at least three
buildings, therefore ensuring that
a satisfactory service can be
provided during holiday and
sickness periods.
The timing of the move is
unusual in that messengers are
normally moved every two years;
Mr Saul was at Linstead for just
one year.
Linstead Hall is different from
other Southside Halls, with its
own bar and catering facility, a
factor that Dr Clarke feels that
College has not fully appreciated.
Mr Saul undertook a number
of extra voluntary duties which
would not be expected of a
messenger but are nevertheless
essential for the smooth running
of the Hall.
One down two to go
RCS Honorary Secretary Miss
Sue Humphrey dropped a
bombshell on the Union by
resigning her post. The shock
decision was revealed in a
statement read by President Eric
Darbyshire at last Monday's
RCSU meeting.
Mr. Darbyshire said at the
meeting that she resigned
because of academic pressure.
However in an exclusive inter-
view with F E L I X , Miss
Humphrey revealed that this was
only part of the reason. She said
that there were differences of
opinion between herself and the
other senior officers in the way
RCSU should be run.
Yet despite her resignation,
Miss Humphrey will continue to
organise the LInion's Freshers'
Dinners, thus ensuring no
disruption pending an election
to replace her.
