BMS work 'up a gear' to meet deadline
D A V E GOODWIN
As always, work on the Bio-Medical
Sciences project continues. The
pace has shifted up a gear following
a 'hiccough' with the implementa-
tion of essential internal services
such as piping and ducting that
occured a few weeks ago.
The complexity of fitting many
pipes and cables into a limited space
meant many specialists were needed
on site at once which led to some
delay. However, following a "re-
squencing program" Phil Hilton,
Schal site manager, confirms that
the program remains on schedule
with a "high intensity of work on all
floors."
Recent work has included putting
the steel roof struts in place and
cladding the walls. He reiterated that
the building work will be finished in
time for the 13th April 1998 hand-
over.
He added that the library exten-
sion will be complete by the 16th
June 1997 despite losing some time
due to exams in the Great Hall at the
end of this term.

Presidential elections
race thaws out
S A N J A Y SIKDAR
East Friday saw papers come down
for the coveted position of President
of Imperial College Union. This is
the second time the Presidential elec-
tion has been run after the first saw a
massive vote to re-open nominations
over the candidature of third year
chemist Samantha Baker.
This time round there are three
candidates standing. They are Clare
Buston of Biology and Management,
Al Hussein, a third year from the
Physics Department and Oily
Newman currently the City & Guilds
Union Academic Affairs Officer.
Despite widespread rumours, last
minute entries of "heavyweight"
candidates failed to materialise. New
Election is also standing for the post
All candidates will be given the
traditional grilling by the the student
body at specially organised hustings.
The official hustings will start in
earnest at Imperial College Union in
dBs on the 13th May. The trio will
then take the arduous trip across
Hyde Park to face the students of St
Mary's the following day. A good
showing there is vital to win the pre-
dictable but lucrative block vote that
the herd like medics will almost cer-
tainly bestow.
For the first time, Charing Cross &
Westminster Medical School will
witness a hustings on Friday 16th
May, however since students there
cannot vote this time round, this will
be an exercise to give the School a
flavour of Imperial College Union's
great democratic system. This "dry-
run" is seen as particularly important
because following Charing Cross's
merger next Autumn, a sabbatical
post concerning medical issues will
most likely be created.
Voting for 1997 Imperial College
Union Presidential election will be
held on the 19th and 20th May with
the results declared at 20.00 hours.
Last time out Felix were unfairly
accused of swinging the vote
towards New Election, but with or
without the media, an absence of
prominent candidates means the des-
tination of the vacancy seems far
from a foregone conclusion,
