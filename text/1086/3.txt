Short-term copyshop contract awarded
continued from front page
A B A Copytech.
Before A B A went into receiver-
ship, Callprint had negotiated a deal
to take over ABA, which was experi-
encing financial difficulties.
However, Callprint only became
aware that the company had gone
into receivership when they were
notified by a third party. They then
commenced talks with the receivers
and made a successful offer for what
remained of A B A . It soon became
apparent that A B A ' s difficulties
started almost from the day they
moved into their Walkway site.
Callprint are looking to re-hire
those staff made redundant by
ABA's closure and have already
reinstated some, including the shop's
former manager. The prices for the
services offered by the shop and the
concessions available to students,
various clubs and departments will
remain fixed until all parties involved
have had the opportunity to discuss
the matter.
The company have indicated their
intent to work in conjunction with
Imperial College Union to arrange
discounts for individual students as
well as for College in general.
Stressing this, Mr Krangel said "We
believe close links with the students
are essential if the venture is to be a
success." He also talked of
Callprint's wish to establish a second
unit on the South Kensington cam-
pus, catering solely for academic
departments in College.
Dr James Bayley, Imperial
College's Procurement Systems
Officer, appeared to be unaware of
Callprint's future plans "We intend
to allow Callprint to run the shop for
the duration of their one month con-
tract, after this we will be inviting
certain companies, like Xerox and
Kodak to bid for the tender."
A B A originally won the contract
because of their willingness to pro-
vide a cost per copy contract, which
none of the larger reprographics
companies would offer at that time.
The College has also been investing
in the development of a software
package to relay print jobs to net-
work printers, which has generated a
considerable amount of commercial
interest. The software developers
hoped to integrate ABA's operation
into the College network and use
their business as a 'dry-run' for their
new software. This project will have
to be abandoned if one of the larger
companies, who already have ade-
quate software packages, win the ten-
der.
Although Callprint specialise in
large format and digital work for
large companies they maintain that
they can still offer a high quality of
service to the College. Mr Krangel
expressed Callprint's desire to great-
ly increase the level of management
in the shop and expand their premis-
es on campus to offer an improved
standard and variety of service for all
customers. This would prove a viable
possibility only if they substantially
increase their prices and will not hap-
pen immediately due to the short
term nature of Callprint's existing
contract.
Callprint's Mr Krangel appeared
optimistic for the future "We believe
in caring about people. If the need for
such a printing service existed yester-
day, then it exists today and Callprint
is here to cater for this need."
A new hope
continued from front page
ers being subjected to real pay degra-
dation, and the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals have
many hopes of the New
Government. The CVCP feels that
UK universities want a change and
the committee wants the new
Government "to be bold, show the
vision required and introduce a new
system".
The AUT's general secretary,
David Triesman, defined two key
issues which are " preparing for a
proper system of funding which
would enable institutions to plan
effectively, and a fair mechanism for
determining the pay of academic and
related staff in Higher Education".
The A U T are looking to the
Dearing Report to recommend a
"rolling five-year funding system"
and whether this is in agreement
with the non-specified intentions for
funding which the Labour Party said
in their manifesto they had put to the
Dearing Committee is yet to be seen.
The National Committee of Inquiry
into Higher Education, which is
chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, is
expected to publish its report in July.
