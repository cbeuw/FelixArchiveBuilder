HEUOSELF

From the first bar of the first song of this record,
everyone in my room started smiling. Ifs just so
screamingly summery, with such teasing sev-
enth chords and gloriously cheesy cadences
that you barely notice the appallingly clashing
lyrics; oh sod this ifs absolutely brilliant. I'm lis-
tening to it as I write and I just want to jump up
and down and sing along. From the power
pop dive-around-your-bedsit of Small Rooms to
the easy listening groove of Live By The Water,
this is like nothing you've ever heard before.
Incorrigibly likeable, so cliched and yet so new.
They can't sing particularly well but it just does-
n't matter, anyone who risks a pulse telephone
solo and makes it sound sharp and funny
deserves global recognition. There are twelve
life heartening songs on this album, most
under three minutes long, all of which you
want to go on forever. The only let down is the
slightly over slow Just To See You, which
sounds like a tragically unsophisticated
Beautiful South whinge, but this is more than
blown out of your mind by the following track
Weight, which features a silent movie style
piano and a tap dancer as the only form of
KT-jTOHaccompaniment to a charmingly

later you are just pleading for more
and you've just got to start it again; more of
that pure sugar and hair-achingly original pop

don't like this album at all. No really.[8)Mr. Trout

Super Furry Animals - Herman Loves Pauline
Sub Blur rock with badly sung yet endearingly
quirky lyrics; pretty much standard for the
'Animals. The B-sides are extraordinarily aver-

Nick Heyward - Today
Blander than bland AOR with absolutely noth-
ing to offer. Alt three racks have exactly the
same riff, pace and feel, all of which are so
fucking dull it makes you want to punch him.
Shit. OK''
Speedy - Time For You
iAny amount of well delivered vocal, brass,
strings and "interesting" syncopation in the
percussion can never disguise a Teenage
Fanclub drudge fest.
The Beekeepers - Lunar
Will someone please invent a few more riffs?
There are other things that you can do with
guitars you know? This one is thankfully a little
more catchy than your traditional fayre, but
up a Metallica songbook. Hmmm.

The Dharmas - Channel Hopper
The only band today who looks like they
actually made an effort with the song. A
immond solo, a iawifeiifaitc and a
decent single to review? What is this then?
Rhyming 'sick of beans on toasf with 'forever
nothing in the post'? Oh sod off and take up
golf or something.
Geneva - Tranquilizer
Pleasant enough, in the same way thai watch-
ing your mum wash up is. Threatens to gel
interesting near the end, but doesn't quite
make it. Utterly harmless.
real sense of fun lifts it some way towards
the decent songcategory. But not all the
way.
Rootjoose - Can't Keep Living This Way
sounds worryingly like The Proclaimers picking Look. Can someone please give me a frigging
i - Naming To Lose
i please. I'd like very much to say that this is
a brilliant original new slant on rock and roll
But ffs a great big sack 'o sh##e. Who lets
people make records like this? Trad-indie bat-
tleship grey retro balls up.
Silicon - Mono
Trip hop by numbers with a bit of a James
Bond tinge to it. Ifs alright but there is hardly
anything to tell your mates about. Erm, ifs dif-
ferent to the indie stuff at least.
