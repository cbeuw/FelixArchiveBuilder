Expectant universities await Blair

Whilst no-one can be ignorant of the
Labour Party's landslide victory at
last week's General Election, news
of the new Government's attitude
toward Higher Education has yet to
filter out of Number 10. One of
Labour's election campaign promis-
es was to make education a 'top pri-
ority', and with their huge majority
of 179, all those concerned in educa-
tion expect New Labour to deliver.
Since Tony Blair took up the reins
as Prime Minister, he has appointed
David Blunkett as Secretary of State
for Employment and Education and
two other educational Ministers of
State; Stephen Byers with special
responsibility for Schools and
Baroness Blackstone with special
responsibility for Further and Higher
education. The Department for
Employment and Education has said
that so far no official decisions on
education have been made but the
intentions are in line with those laid
out in the manifesto. David Blunkett
has, however, expressed a wish to
pass a short bill through Parliament
to prevent expenditure on assisted
places in private schools from
September 1998 in order to release
money to be used in areas such as the
reduction of class sizes.
The education section of the
Labour Manifesto focused on prima-
ry and secondary education. The
more notable plans include the aboli-
tion of the nursery voucher scheme
from which the money saved will be
used to ensure nursery places for 4
year olds, an undertaking to reduce
class sizes for 5 to 7 year olds, and a
commitment to improve standards in
primary schools and the teaching of
the three "r's". Labour does not
favour the eleven-plus which
"divides children into successes and
failures at far too early an age" but
prefers modernised comprehensives
where children are set according to
ability.
The proposals for Higher
Education suggest that there is little
money available in this area with the
student loan system likely to super-
sede the already declining grant sys-
tem. The manifesto states "costs of
student maintenance should be
repaid by graduates on an income
related basis" and also says that the
changes required in Higher
Education cannot be funded out of
general taxation.

College, were bought out by
Callprint, a London based printing
and photocopying company. It has
now been established that Callprint
have obtained a short-term, one
month contract from College, after
which the operating contract will be
put out to tender.
Callprint's Director, Norman
Krangel, met with Ian Greaves,
Imperial College's Purchasing
Manager, last Friday to discuss the
possibility of Callprint taking over
the printing shop, situated just off
the main walkway. The contract that
was decided upon subjects Callprint

that agreed between College and
