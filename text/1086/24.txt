with Simon Cope of Team #1 on pole
position. After building up a com-
fortable lead, he was penalised by the
marshals for putting four wheels on
the grass (bollocks, it was only two!).
Team #2 found a return to form, with
Niall Darwin doing an outstanding
stint to take them into second place.
They held this position until the final
lap when Simon Cross spun, handing
2nd place, and their final winning
point to Warwick #2.
Many thanks to all those who
attended, especially the sole female
competitor from Warwick who had
chosen not to wear a bra for the
event. Nice short crop top, and good
work, bird!!
Final result:
First -
Second

Warwick #2
Imperial #1
Nottingham #2
Imperial #2
Near miss for ace oarswoman
This was the first event of its kind,
and Imperial's teams - Simon,
Lawrence, Chris and Phil for the
Firsts, and Tim, Simon, Niall and
Phil for the Seconds - put in a fine
performance, taking 2nd and 4th
places overall. Only a mistake by
Simon Cope in the opening laps of
Race 3 prevented us from taking
overall victory, which went to
Warwick's 2nd team with a margin
of only one point.
A good practice session saw
Imperial starting Race 1 in 2nd and
3rd position on the rolling grid.
However, we were outclassed by
Nottingham, who had the big advan-
tage of circuit knowledge. Imperial
#2 finished well after fighting back
from a 30 sec penalty incurred by
Tim Atkinson for ignoring pit-lane
signals.
Race 2 started wet after a brief
rain-shower which caused much
amusement in the opening laps.
Nottingham, in pole position after
their first race victory, dropped out of
contention after a loose engine
caused them to lose one of their drive
chains. Imperial #2 had a poor finish;
one team member blaming it on a
'shite kart'. Meanwhile, Team #1
drove a storming race with Phil
Wise, who never put a wheel wrong
all day, taking the chequered flag by
over a minute for maximum points.
Hopes were high for the final race,

A twenty four year old student from
the Imperial College Union Boat
Club was injured in an incident
which could have cost a lot more
than the capsizing of a boat. Karen
Jourdan was training in the Thames
with a fellow rower, Anna
MacDonald (a medical student from
St Mary's) when their boat crashed
into a crew of four from Tideway
Scullers School.
The crash occurred near Chiswick
Bridge where Imperial College
Union Boat Club usually train. Karen
was rushed to Charing Cross
Hospital as she had a four inch gash
and a cut nerve to her calf.
Karen Jourdan is a future prospect
for Britain in many up and coming
major international events - Bill
Manson the Imperial College Union
Boat Club's manager said that Karen
has potential in internationals in a
light-weight class and is hoping that
she will be ready for the Henley
Regatta which is held in June.
The Tideway Scullers School boat
had ridden up onto the Imperial
College boat as both were travelling
very fast in opposite directions.
According to Karen, their boat went
straight into her leg. This caused their
boat to capsize. Their brave coach
attempted to rescue them from his
launch but as the girls panicked [/]
they caused his boat to capsize as
well as their own.
All were eventually rescued hero-
ically by crews from Quintin Boat
Club and Auriol Kensington Rowing
Club who pulled them out of the
water [Nice one lads - Sports Eds}.
Due to the severity of Karen's
injury, surgeons performed an emer-
gency operation and her boyfriend
missed his sister's wedding in
Kingston to make sure that she was
alright and to comfort her after the
operation [Ain't that very sweet -
Sports Eds].
Karen, who is working toward her
PhD, has been put on antibiotics and
is expected to not be able to put any
weight on her leg for the next few
weeks
| We hope that you 're fighting fit
soon - Sports Eds].
