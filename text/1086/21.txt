F E L I X FRIDAY 9 T H M A Y COLUMNS 21
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
$t1
I expect Tony Blair woke up on
Friday or Saturday morning with a
very wide grin on his face. Although
few people were surprised by the
Labour victory, the scale of it has
come as a shock to even the most
optimistic Labour supporter.
Labour have 419 of the 659 seats
available in the House of Commons,
giving them an extremely comfort-
able majority of 179 seats. Even if
public opinion swung some way
against them in the next five years,
they could still win a working major-
ity for a second term in Government.
The Conservatives, for their part, are
resigned to perhaps ten years in
Opposition, and there are predictions
that they may tear themselves to
pieces over Europe, in the same way
they did over the Corn Laws in the
19th Century, keeping them out of
power for generations.
They scale of Labour's majority
has had some unforeseen conse-
quences for the Labour hierarchy,
with Labour MPs returned in seats
that they had not expected to win.
Such MPs include John McDonnell,
who supports Sinn Fein over the
SDLP and lists his hobbies to include
".. .fermenting the overthrow of cap-
italism". Some of the reporting of
this problem has been exaggerated:
politicians are always more extreme
in there views within the party and
within their peer-group, but the effect
of arriving at Parliament generally
moderates their views. However,
they could well spell trouble in the
future for Blair's government.
As most people know, John Major
announced his resignation as Party
Leader on his final departure from 10
Downing Street. He will continue as
Leader of the Opposition until a new
leader can be elected. This will take
some time, however, since first he
must set up an Opposition front
bench of 70 shadow ministers. From
the remaining 90 or so backbenchers,
a new '1922' committee must be
elected (the majority of the last one,
including the chairman, Sir Marcus
Fox, lost their seats). When that is
done, the committee will then organ-
ise the leadership contest. All this
will happen in a matter of months, so
they can unite and form a proper
Opposition.
The choice of leader will be the
aspect that may tear them apart.
Many right-wing grandees lost seats,
leaving old left-wingers in the major-
ity at the top, but the new
Conservative MPs (not that there are
many of them) have a majority of
right-wingers. So far Ken Clarke has
announced his candidature, with
Peter Lilley, Michael Howard,
William Hague and Stephen Dorrell
waiting in the wings. Michael
Heseltine ruled himself out due to ill
health. To many people this motley
collection may sound like a freak
show, and many Tories are quietly
shaking their heads with sorrow at
the quality of the candidates. Ken
Clarke's pro-European views leave a
bad taste in the mouth for too many
Tories too stand a chance, and
Michael Howard, although a strong
performer in debates, is generally
despised by the public at large. They
may choose William Hague, who at
36, is young enough to skip a gener-
ation and provide an experienced but
not too elderly opponent in a future
General Election.
Whatever happens, they will all
have to wonder just why they lost so
appallingly, what the new
Government is likely to achieve, and
try to choose a sensible path. It is
possible that they may need to rein-
vent themselves like Blair reinvented
the Labour party. Most of the public
would welcome the change.
You'll have to forgive me if I seem a
little hesitant this week. It's this
Opposition lark, you see, all new to
me. I have never before experienced
a Conservative election defeat, and
my political memory stretches back
no further than the glorious day in
1979 when Lady Thatcher stormed
to power. The General Election was
not a defeat, not even a landslide. I'm
afraid it was a political earthquake
that broke the Richter Scale. As I sat
there in the wee small hours, I was
utterly gobsmacked. The scale of the
pounding was beyond anyone's
expectation. Seats that have been
blue since Noah was doing the
rounds fell to Labour or the Lib
Dems. Disbelief doesn't even begin
to describe it. Still, it was nice to be
consoled by all my political soul-
mates here on Friday. Not.
The reasons for our defeat, if young
Mr Weir will permit me to elaborate,
are numerous, and I think that,
although in the final analysis victory
looked less than certain, we could
have minimised the damage. The one
reason that would have been difficult
to change was the wish for a change
and the general 'fed up with the
Tories' attitude.
The desire for change lead to some
of the most successful and wide-
spread tactical voting ever seen in
this country. As those of you who
watched the BBC's exceptionally
good coverage will remember, the
swing to Lib Dem in Labour targets
Simon
was small and vice versa for Lib
Dem battlegrounds, maximising the
scale of the defeat. Given that any
government is bound to make the
odd mistake, it is therefore obvious
that the longer you are in govern-
ment, the more errors you rack up
and the easier
it is for your
opponents to
capitalise on it
and the need
for change.
Though the
Conservatives
had some very
good mani-
festo ideas -
reform of the
state pension
(almost cer-
tainly to be
implemented
by Harriet
Harmen and
Frank Field
and transfer of
t a x
a l l o w a n c e s
from unwork-
ing spouses to
name but two-
this alone
could not be
enough. Party
unity, or the lack of, was a major fac-
tor in the defeat. The old maxim that
divided parties don't get elected was
vindicated. Given the shift in the
party, we should have presented a
Eurosceptic front, but a coherent one.
Euroscepticism, to my mind, does
not mean pull out of the EU, but
rather strengthen and reform the core
institutions of the Union, not least the
Single market, rather than march
headlong into monetary union, the
enabling step

article. As it
was, there was

that little time

Which brings
me to sleaze.
Voice of Reason
The exaspera-
tion that I have
felt about this
| can be second
only to John
Major. I have
argued in pri-
vate on
n u m e r o u s
occasions that,
in the absence
of mechanism
for Central
Office to
remove a local candidate, Neil
Hamilton should be shot. His pres-
ence did so much to distract the
media and public, totally negating
the extra length of the campaign. The
British Parliament is by far the clean-
est, most honourable legislative body
in the world, and to let it be tarnished
by the likes of him, bereft of any
sense of honour and decency, is sad-
dening to say the least. As most MPs
will agree, I'm sure, people like him
are present in near negligible num-
bers in the House, but succeed in tar-
ring all with the same brush. People
like Mr Hamilton should realise that
the job of an M P is not to serve him
self or even his party, but to serve his
constituents and his country.
Still, cometh the hour, cometh the
man. The Conservatives will regroup
under a new leader (my money's on
Hague or Redwood) and will be
back. After the 1945 landslide,
Labour managed only one term. I'll
give them a few weeks to settle in
before passing judgement. It would
be churlish of me to hope they screw
the country up merely to prove me
right, but let's wait and see. Lest you
think I forgot, space has denied me
the chance to reply to Ashton
McGregor's article. Full marks for
putting the other side, but let me say
two things. Firstly, you are wrong on
several points, and I shall respond in
due course. Secondly, I shall not be
bolstering my argument with cheap
personal insults, as you predicted.
And finally, the cost of standing
down Schal is £200,000 not
£3,200,000, a figure arrived at when
email savaged my pounds signs
Honest, Mr Caldwell.
