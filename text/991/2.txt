Elections Update
BY ANDREW TSENG
The race for Imperial College
Union sabbatical posts has gained
momentum this week.
With only a few hours to go
before papers come down, the
declared candidates for President
are: Kamran Bashir, Lucy Chothia,
Dave Cohen and Paul Thomas; for
Deputy President (Finance &
Services): Timothy Brown and
Daniel Look; for Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies): Ian Parish and
Mark Baylis; for Felix Editor &
Print Unit Manager: Owain
Bennallack and Joe McFadden.
Following speculation reported
in last week's Felix, all those
rumoured to be interested in
standing have, except the Royal
College of Science Union (RCSU)
President, Rhian Picton. However,
at the time of going to press,
sources close to Ms Picton have
said that she is still considering
standing for the Presidency.
The battle for the Deputy
Presidencies, which some thought
would be uncontested, have also
been the subject of deliberation. In
the bout for title of Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies), Ian
Parish, ex-Aero Soc Chairman, will
put up a strong fight. Proposed by
the former City & Guilds College
Union (C&GCU) President Kate
Dalton, he promises to be a strong
candidate. Opposition comes in the
form of Mark Baylis from Materials
III. Strong on management and a
clubs and societies enthusiast, he is
being proposed by another
Materials scientist, Mr Kheir.
In the election of Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
Daniel Look of Geology III has
announced his candidature.
Currently Publications Board Junior
Treasurer and ex-Head of Discos at
IC Radio, Mr Look should provide
sturdy opposition to Timothy
Brown from Computing.
Papers came down on
Wednesday for the C & G C U elec-
tions. The candidates are: for
President: Fiona Grandison (Chem
Eng II); for Vice President: Jim
Spender (ISE I) and Richard
Oussedik (MAT I); for Publicity
Officer: Sarah Thomas (Chem Eng
I); for Academic Affairs Officer:
Eric Fosdike (DoC I); for Hon Sec:
Tammy Atkins (EE I); for
Entertainments Chairman: Lewis
Macleoud (EE I); for Guildsheet
Editor: T i m Walls (DoC I), D
Tindall (Civ Eng I); for Honorary
Junior Treasurer: Paras Sidapara
(DoC I), Gareth Parry (ME I); for
C G C A Representative: Mark
Walton (Chem Eng III), Su Purdom
(ISE II); for Dept Soc Officer: A . M .
Easwaran (DoC II), Ben Maxwell
(ME I).
With the introduction of the joint
ICU/Security Swipe Card for first
year students, Guilds will be
pioneering the new system of
voting which will then be used in
the ICU sabbatical elections.
Speaking to Felix, Paul Griffiths,
President of C & G C U , said: "those
who have been standing appear to
be a really enthusiastic bunch."
The Constituent College Unions'
increased profile this year has also
been reflected in the R C S U elec-
tions. At the time of going to press,
those standing are: for President:
Emma Holmes (Chem II); for Hon
Sec: Chris Louis (Chem I); for
Honorary Junior Treasurer: Chris
Bragg (Physics I); for Academic
Affairs Officer: Matt Szyndel
(Physics I).

Debate between students and
Imperial College Sports Centre has
reopened after the resignation of
Manager Carolyne Osner. Rumours
that she left, dissatisfied with
'College management' have been
dismissed by Assistant Manager
Colin Wilson. "She has just taken a
logical step up the promotional
ladder. Carolyne has taken a new
career path and taken a post at a
private health club. It's the only
thing that she hasn't really done in
the leisure field." Ms Osner was
manager of the Sports Centre over
the period of its refurbishment and
left on the 11th of February.
The Centre has been a source of
debate since the last Union General
Meeting ( U G M ) . Students
complained about prices and over-
crowding due to use by the public.
One student commented:"It gets
ridiculous. Y o u pay to use the
weights but you spend half of the
time queueing because members of
the public are using them. It's a
waste of time even attempting to go
swimming at the weekend because
the pool is packed with little kids."
Colin Wilson commented:"The
prices are extremely competitive in
comparison to other universities.
The overcrowding problem is
mainly due to the small size of the
facility. The public are encouraged
to use the centre at off peak times
when students are not using it as
much."
Charlie Leary, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies), told Felix:
"The fact is the Union took out a
substantial sized loan from the
Harlington Trust to pay for the
refurbishment. The Sports Centre is
currently running at a loss and the
money brought in from outside
users is needed to keep the Centre
open. It's a shame it has to be this
way and if anything else could be
done it would be."
Disabilities

Loretta O'Callaghan can now be

Building (at the rear). Her new tele-
phone number is extension 3455.
