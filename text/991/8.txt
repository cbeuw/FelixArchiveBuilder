Clubs and Societies
OSC Soccer Vampires, Beasts, Mutant Babies
The last of the group matches were played last
week. On a wet surface, the African Caribbean,
Sri Lankan, and Singapore societies battled it
out for the last two places in the quarter finals.
The newly formed African Caribbean
Society, with their laid back 'South American'
style football, beat the Sri Lankans in a fairly
one sided game. There was some very beautiful
football, but a considerable lack of potent
striking force.
The Singapore Society also easily overcame
the Sri Lankans winning 11-0.
The game between the Singaporeans and
African Caribbeans was the best game played in
the tournament so far. The first half was played
at a thrilling pace, with both teams defending
extremely well. Not many goal scoring oppor-
tunities were created; the Singaporeans hit the
post and the African Caribbeans missed an open
goal and at half time the score was still 0- 0.
The second half was more productive. The
Singapore team made some tactical changes and
with some sloppy defence by the African Carib-
beans, two easy goals were scored. It then
seemed as if the African Caribbean's had given up
and the Singapore team scored few more goals.
Next week, the semi finals and final will be
played.

Black and white this week; Monday's ICSF
video project double bill consists of Nosferatu
(6pm) and La Belle et la Bete (8pm) in Chem
Eng LIT.
This is F W Murnau's Nosferatu, the best
adaptation of the Dracula legend, parallelling the
spread of the vampire's infection with that of a
wasting disease. The film take some liberties
with the original novel, particularly with
characters' names, but this was an attempt to
avoid copyright problems form Bram Stoker's
widow who did in fact try to have every print of
the film destroyed; fortunately, some escaped.
La Belle et La Bete is Jean Cocteau's surreal
take on the story of Beauty and the Beast.
Fanciful, French and funny with beautiful design
(much of which was quoted by Francis Ford
Corolla in his Dracula) it is a whimsical and
spell binding fantasy.
Both films are free to ICSF members. Mem-
bership is £3 and gets you in free to our video

projected double bills, the chance to borrow over
3,000 books, videos and graphic novels from our
library in and reduced entry to our 35mm

On Tuesday at 7pm in the Concert Hall, we
enter the bizarre world of David Lynch's
Eraserhead. The scariest movie ever made'
(apparently) is the story of Henry, who dreams
of foetal worms, girls in the radiator and the
Beautiful Girl Across The Hall to escape the
horrifying mundanity of his life. But in this
strange, twisted world, mundanity is trans-
formed to symbolic nightmare as his girlfriend
suddenly births a monstrous baby for which he
is forced to assume responsibility. Lynch fans
should watch out for The Grandmother (his
second short) coming soon and Dune at the end
of term.
Admission if £1.50 to ICSF members and £2
to non members. Membership is £3 including
your fist film free.
