Award
BY MIKE INGRAM
A Professor from St Mary's
Hospital Medical School has been
awarded an international prize for
his work in medicine.
Professor Robert Williamson is
the Head of the Department of
Biochemistry at St Mary's. He
received the 1994 King Faisal
International Prize for Medicine
jointly with Professor William
French Anderson (of the University
of Southern California) for his
work in the field of gene therapy.
Professor Williamson is respon-
sible for the discovery of the gene
that causes Thalassemia A . This
advance is described as having
profound importance in the applica-
tions of gene therapy for treating
genetic disorders. His co-recipient,
Professor Anderson, is a recognised
pioneer in this field, as well as a
leading figure in the search for
ethical guidelines for its application.
The prize is awarded by the
King Faisal Foundation in Saudi
Arabia. Other categories include
Science, Arabic Literature, Islamic
Studies and Service to Islam.
Pimlico Open Day
BY JOE MCFADDEN
One hundred and fifty secondary
schoolchildren descended on
Imperial College this Wednesday
for the Pimlico Connection Open
Day. It is designed to give kids a
better idea of what University life is
all about.
The Open Day was organised
and run by the Pimlico Connection
Society and featured demonstra-
tions and talks from the staff and
students of many departments.
Pimlico Connection tutors acted
as guides for the children, who
came from six of the schools in the
Pimlico tutoring scheme.
Professor David Phillips got the
afternoon off to a flying start with
his 'Flashes and Bangs' Lecture.
One member of the audience
commented: "I never knew lectures
could be like that." (And that was
one of the tutors!). Other events
included a tour of IC Radio, STOIC
and the Felix office.
Pimlico Connection Society
Chairman, Puneet Singh, outlined
the purpose of the Pimlico
Connection scheme: "Having tutors
in schools dispels rumours about
what universities are like and encour-
ages them into higher education."
Kelda Bratley, organiser of the
Open Day, said that the event was
"a great success. Some of what the
kids saw went over their heads, but
everyone enjoyed themselves."
Project Amazon
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Research scientists from Imperial
College (IC) have pioneered a £1.2
million project to monitor mercury
levels in Brazil.
The three year project is in
response to fears that mercury, used
in gold mining, has entered the food
chain and aims to educate gold
traders in cleaner mining technolo-
gies. Special concern has arisen
with children in the gold-rush areas
of the Amazon contracting the fatal
Minamata Disease. The illness,
caught by eating contaminated fish,
is a symptomless disease that
effects the central nervous system.
Children aged between 10 and 14
years are the most vulnerable. Gold
traders are also at risk, suffering
poisoning from mercury vapour.
The project, funded by the
European Commission, is being
managed by Paul Docx of IC
Consultants (ICON). It will help
Brazilian groups monitor mercury
levels in the people and ecosystems
of the Amazon. People who may
have suffered clinical mercury
poisoning w i l l be located and
treated. A vital part of the work will
be the adoption of cleaner mining
technologies to reduce mercury
spillages. Professor Iain Thornton,
who headed the earlier research
team, will act as a consultant on the
project and some cross-analysis of
samples will be carried out at IC.
