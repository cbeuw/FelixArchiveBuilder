Revenge is a dish best served cold and the
Imperial College 2nd XI had a whole week to
prepare a vendetta against the Royal Free
Hospital (RFH), following a pounding 6-2 home
defeat by the medical school. The retaliation
strategy seemed to be effective in the first 45
minutes but only slightly. IC had most of the
possession but were unable to capitalise on their
dominance. R F H scored twice at the beginning
of the second half, thanks to firm defending and
benevolent fortune.
Young Roddy Herris put in a superlative
performance on his debut; not so young Chris
Collison battled with typical resolve; the fasting
Mohammed Al-Said destroyed the key
opposition player with unmatched precision; and
the unshaven Abs Said pulled one back with a
hard driven shot. However, Imperial's joy was
short lived as the Royals struck once again,
extending their lead to 3-1.
Skipper Rakesh Muthoo squandered the
easiest of chances: This was the kind of stuff
nightmares are made of. However, where
Muthoo showed indecision, Anthony Clerc
displayed elegance scoring a clinical goal
crowning another commendable passing move.
The referee blew the final whistle shortly
afterwards and in the end, Clerc's effort proved
to have been too little, too late.
The Seconds had to wait another four days,
for their away match against Kings College
Hospital (KCH), for something to write home
about. The opposition players were all over six
foot tall, there were only a few blades of grass in
the midst of the mud and sand on the playing
field and there was an odour of bovine
excrement in the air. Indeed, despite a well
worked 'haka', IC conceded two goals to the
opposition within tens minutes of the start.
Imperial remained optimistic as their team
was strengthened by the presence of A Futon at
the back and Ritch Craig in the middle. Indeed it
was Craig who passed a lovely ball to Dennis
Nadarajah and Billal Al-Khatib finished in style.
And it was Craig again who equalised for IC
with a devious shot off an inviting assist from
Muthoo at the start of the second half.
Their tails were up now and a winner came
from the astutely positioned Muthoo who
deviated a sweet corner kick from Al-Khatib
into the K C H goal. IC then struck again with the
inspired Al-Said beating the opposition keeper
with a teasing diagonal shot. Despite a final,
desperate attempt by Richie Dixon to bring more
excitement to the game by conceding a penalty
to K C H , Imperial cruised to a well deserved
victory. With four more games left to the end of
the season, the possibility of avoiding relegation
from Division One becomes more concrete.
