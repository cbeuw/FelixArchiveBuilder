The 'E' Word
Yep, the sabbatical election process is under
way for this year. Papers come down in a few
hours and candidates will be making sure they
are fully seconded and no-one has crossed their
name off at the last minute. Stress and paranoia
are beginning to take a hold as everyone is
watching everyone else and no-one wants to
give anything away about their tactics or ideas
Each candidate is trying to figure out the best
way to get as many of the groups around college
on their side as possible.
A number of the candidates have been into
the Felix Office to book printing slots for their
publicity. It's an interesting thing to experience.
They are so worried about anyone else even
glimpsing their publicity. "Should I put it in an
envelope or will it be O K as it is?" "Are you
sure no-one else will see it?" So much stress and
paranoia and the campaigning hasn't even
started yet.
Although the candidates will deny it, elec-
tioneering is already taking place. Any chance
they get to talk to someone about their ideas for
next year, they'll take it. Some are taking the
angle of "What do you want me to do for you
next year" and some are asking "What do you
think of this idea?" They'll make all sorts of
promises based on this in their manifestoes, but
I'll bet that a lot of them will be for vote-gaining
purposes more than anything.
Look out for mentions of St Mary's. Their
vote has only ever been a block vote and all the
candidates desperately want to make sure that
they get it, one way or another. Woe betide any
St Mary's student found to be on the South Ken
campus - they'll be pounced on straight away
and vehemently talked at in a desperate attempt
to find out just how to get this mysterious block
vote.
As Dave Goddard said in Felix about a
month ago, people "spend the best part of a
month being disgustingly nice to people". Just
watch how people will change over the next
couple of weeks.
