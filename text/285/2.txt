This term has seen the best start to Carnival lor many years, with
Guilds doing more than their share of stunts and collections.
The scene was set for a
record-breaking year by a
tiddlywinks marathon with
M . . . . down and across Oxford
Street. About 60 people turned
out on a wet Saturday morn-
ing to do battle and £75 was
collected, which amazed every-
one who took part and even
M . . . . (whose presence was
debatable).
Lord Mayor's Show
Since the beginning of term,
a lot of effort was put into
the Guilds float, and its mere
presence in the show was
enough to promote a mammoth
£150, with an estimated £20
from the Metropolitan police.
This was an even more amaz-
ing result than the Winks,
since street collecting during
the show was "strictly for-
bidden".
Spurred on by this, Guilds
turned out in force for the
non-event of the year, the 3
legged pub crawl with the in-
visible women from the Royal
College of Music on Novem-
ber 14th. However what could
have been a nasty situation
(judging by the menacing faces
around the lower lounge that
night) was turned into an ex-
cellent stag evening by the
agile brain of Stu Simpson, who
suggested going to Hyde Park
Corner — so we all went down
to the West End. The beer
and money flowed freely, add-
ing a further £130 to the piggy
bank.
Bed-ridden
The day after brought the
famous London - Southampton
bed race. This was badly
organised by the College of
Estate Management, and only 3
beds turned up at Marble Arch
at the appointed hour, includ-
ing Guilds and Mines/RCS
entries. The bed was pushed as
far as Kingston, when the other
bed scorched past at about 50
mph, surrounded by a van.
The Guilds hot-bed was then
duly loaded into a Transit van
and taken to Guildford, where
several trips were made up and
down the main street (the race
had now become the Lands End
—John o'Groates bed race). £50,
two Southampton University
signs, and numerous other odds
ana sous were
to college.

More . . .
As if this isn't enough, Elec
Eng 1 went out busking 3
weeks ago, collecting £30 in a
half hour, whilst a week later
Chem Eng made £60 with the
gorilla (now in Chem Eng 1.)
A simple addition yields
approximately £500, the best
start we've made since the
Boer War; and it doesn't need
a President to work out that
twice as many people could
have doubled that amount.
So come along. Let's have
more support — we need you,
Carnival needs you. Start with
carol singing tonight (7.00 pm
Mech Eng Concourse). You're
sure to enjoy yourself. Song
sheets and megaphones pro-
vided. See you.
