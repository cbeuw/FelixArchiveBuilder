University College 9 pts. Imperial College 14 pts.
On Wednesday 19th IC beat a determined UC side at
Shenley to win through to the second round of the Univer-
sity Cup competition. In what turned out to be a very hard,
rough match the result hung in the balance until the final
5 minutes.
Ace goal kicker dive Swinnerton opened the scoring
for IC with a first minute penalty from 35 yards, only for
UC to equalise with a lucky opportunist try. 'Noddy'
Conolly then scored a superlative try following a devastating
centre break. A 50 yards penalty goal enabled UC to
equalise.
The score remained 6 all well into the second half until
the UC fly half dropped a fine goal. With things looking
decidedly grey for IC, Mike Adams scored from the corner
following good work by the IC backs. Swinnerton, who
had gross bad luck with his kicks, goaled the try for IC, to
lead 11-9. Another penalty goal by him in the last 5 minutes
sealed UC's fate.
Playing QMC — the holders — in the next round, IC's
pack will certainly have to sharpen up and get the backs
the possession they need and deserve !

Sporting Women
BADMINTON
The only match in the last
fortnight was a ladies,
against QMC on Wednesday
19th at Wimbledon, and
proved rather a disaster for
IC. The final score was 9-0
to QMC with only a couple
of the games hard fought.
QMC were by far the better
and stronger team and well
deserved their victory.

chin.
HOCKEY
Despite the weather two
games have been played in
the last fortnight. The first
defeat of the season was suf-
fered last Wednesday when
a rather weakened team went
down 2-0 to UC. The IC
attack was unable to pene-
trate a rather strong UC de-
fence and IC probably did
well to lose only 2-0.

field, S. Edwards, S. Inskip,

Allinson.
MIXED HOCKEY
On Sunday 23rd the mixed
team had a return match
against The Land Registry,
again at their ground as
there was no pitch available
at Harlington. Fortunately
our team quickly got used to
the bumps in the pitch with
the result that play was
focused in the Land Regis-
try's half giving a final score
of 2-0 to IC.

NETBALL
The feeling after the
match against West Ham
Polytechnic on Wednesday
26th at South Kensington
was that the team had done
it at last. They had got their
first victory for a long time
and that a resounding one
with a final score of 37-8 to
IC. The play was not so one-
sided as the score suggests,
but the more accurate pass-
ing and shocking of IC
payed dividends.

As the first term draws to a close and the season is half
over for many clubs, the most successful to date are the rugby,
football, and badminton clubs. The rugby 1st XV had a
convincing win over UC in the Gutteridge Cup 1st round,
and Mike Adams is to be congratulated on producing a
consistent team this season. The football club 1st XI are
joint leaders of the Premier Division of the UL League,
and should beat QEC in the UL Cup 1st round proper (see
Felicity for result).
So far this season the badminton club have won all four
league games under the guidance of Phil Poyser, but some
of its members have had even greater success individually.
At the British Universities Badminton Championship the
mens doubles title was won by G. Georgian and S. Donald
both from the Maths Dept. at IC. Lynne Beynon of Chemis-
try II took the women's singles title, was runner-up in the
mixed doubles and won a bronze medal as semi-finalist in
the Women's doubles. Many congratulations are conveyed
by Felix to all three.

13 THE ARCADE
S. KEN STATION
The last 3 matches played
by the 1st X I have resulted
in good victories for IC, and
the team is now beginning
to realise its potential. From
the start of the season the
defence has been sound and
has not conceded more than
a single goal in most of the
matches. However, until re-
cently the forwards have not
been able to score goals, al-
though they have made
numerous chances. Now,
however, that the whole
team is working well there
seems to be no reason why
the results for the rest of the
season should not be ex-
tremely satisfactory.
IC 1 Kemble College,
Oxford 0
IC were on top for the
whole of this match and the
scoreline does not do justice
to the margin of superiority
we were able to establish.
The only goal was scored by
Bates late in the second half
after a melee in the goal-
mouth.
Skating
I.C. Skating Club meets
every Thursday evening at
Queen's Ice Rink along with
the girls of the French In-
stitute. At the moment they
outnumber us heavily so
come along and help us out.
If you haven't skated before,
don't worry, as our club
members range from the ex-
pert to the absolute begin-
ner, with a high percentage
of women.
We also skate on Wednes-
day afternoons with U L U
Ice Skating Club. Member-
ship cards and cheap tickets
may be obtained from Pete
Goddard, E E PG (Room
1107, Irit 3154) or by the
Union Cloakroom on Wed-
nesday between 1.15 and
1.40.
We do have a very real
problem created by the large
number of F.I. girls on
Thursday evenings, as a high
proportion of them only
come along to meet men,
anyway! You were asking
for suggestions on how IC
men could meet F.I. women
in the last Felix, and here is
a good way !

IC 4 Ashford 1
This was an extremely
good victory since the team
included 3 members of the
2nd X I due to injuries of
normal 1st team players, and
also since Ashford are one
of our stronger opponents.
After about ten minutes
Pratt scored a very good
goal, and the score remained
1-0 to IC until half-time. In
the first 5 minutes of the
second half IC scored twice,
one by Pratt and one by
Bates. Pratt completed his
hat-trick midway through
the second half when the
Ashford goalkeeper allowed
a rather weak shot to trickle
between his legs. The Ash-
ford goal was scored in the
last 10 minutes of the match
when the marking in the IC
defence had become rather
slack.
IC 1 Bart's Hospital a
This match was marred by
the fact that the opposition
failed to bring an umpire
with them and it is not prac-
ticable for one man to see all
the fouls which occur. In
the first half, IC pressed hard
and we were very unlucky
not to score on several oc-
casions. Early in the second
half IC were awarded a short
corner and the shot result-
ing from this was kicked off
the line by one of the Bart's
fullbacks. The only goal of
the match came from the
penalty stroke awarded for
this offence. This goal
seemed to bring the Bait's
team to life and they stret-
ched the IC team to its
limits, in fact almost beyond
its limits on two or three
occasions. However, IC man-
aged to hold out till the end
to gain a very good win.
Both the 2nd and 3rd XFs
had matches with their
counterparts from Ashford;
The 2nd X I were beaten 1-0
and the 3rd X I achieved a
creditable 1-1 draw. Both
these teams have now be-
come much more regular
and this can only result in
an upward trend in their
results.

On Saturday, I.C. entertained Woolwich, who seemed
to have strengthened their team since the first match of
the season when I.C. beat them 4-2. In the first quarter
of an hour Woolwich put the pressure on I.C. but the
defence played well and survived this attack. During a
breakaway, Wilcock tried a long shot which went over
the goalie for a good goal. This was just reward for Wilcock
who seemed to be the only I.C. player willing to have a shot
in this and in previous games. I.C. were still, however,
playing badly. They are unfortunate in that several key
players seem to have lost their recent form at the same time.
Woolwich equalised in the first half with a penalty for
handball. I.C., starving for the lead, continued to play the
completely wrong game. They persisted in playing a long
ball down the middle, which Woolwich's 6ft 6in centre half
counteracted with no difficulty.
The game continued in mediocrity, Woolwich collecting
a goal in the second half to clinch the result.
I.C. made changes for Wednesday's game against West
Ham. These were made to try and find a goalscoring blend.
The goals came, although it may be said West Ham were
not really spirited opponents. I.C. played a wide game with
players taking the ball to the line and pulling the ball back.
Wilcock once again opened the scoring after some intelligent
running on to a Dixon pass. Wiley scored soon after from a
pass from T.M. who beat two men in taking the ball to the
line and pulling the ball back. McArdle, struggling to find
form, followed a lone attack by Dixon to slot the ball home,
to finish a good move started by a long pass out of defence
by Widelski. In the second half, I.C. cooled down con-
siderably, playing a less effective game, but still managed
to score again through Widelski, Dixon and McArdle
(penalty). We hope this game sees the come-back of I.C.
although West Ham may not be a true test.
The 5ths, at home to West Ham's seconds, also gained a
convincing 13-0 win, with captain Andy Jackson scoring
six goals. He was ably supported by M . Hameson who
netted four times. Other scorers were D. Coulson, 2, C.
Potter, 1. On the defensive side, the two full backs played
ably when pressure was applied. This was 5ths second
good game having drawn with league leaders Woolwich
2nds who had previously not had a goal against them in
three games.
After hearing of Mines' recent good form, the 2nd X I
expected a good game. The 2nds, however, brushed aside
Mines to pulverise them 7-0. But it must be said that I.C.
2nd fielded a very strong side, five of whom have had 1st
team experience.
