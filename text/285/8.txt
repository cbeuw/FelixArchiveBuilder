After
Gorilla,
What
n e x t ?
You may have noticed,
especially if you happen to
be a bank cashier, a Mooney
Minion or a Physics lecturer,
that a gorilla has been on
the rampage in I.C.
This beast was found
roaming loose, in a very
dangerous condition, in
Prince's Gardens on Mon-
day; but thanks to some
good rope-work that night
by Messrs. Hobman and
Taylor, it was calmed down
considerably and its disposi-
tion towards people, especi-
ally the weaker sex, became
quite alarming at times!
Monday night and Tues-
day were spent introducing
Graham (as it had been
christened) to the officials of
I.C. and their worshippers,
and it was during this period
that someone suggested tea-
ching this new Southside
resident how to wield a col-
lecting tin.
Preliminary tests carried
out on Wednesday afternoon
in the West End gave quite
good results, although in one
memorable case money was
obtained by intimidation
more than by politeness —
the unfortunate subject was
almost forcibly evcited from
the Central Line train be-
tween Chancery Lane and
St. Paul's when he refused
to pay up (sorry, to make a
donation).
After a couple more col-
Graham introducing itself to David Frost
lections, Saturday saw the
gorilla in Downing Street
with a letter begging money
from schh... you know
who, but so far no reply has
been received.
The highspot of the gor-
illa's brief period of freedom
was an abortive attempt to
gatecrash " Frost on Satur-
day ." Although we couldn't
get in on the show we did
make our presence felt in no
uncertain manner!
Well, after that, you can
always walk — all you need
is one sponsor (or more),
and two (or more) feet. You
start out from the Union
Snack Bar at 11 p.m. (5th
December) and after a brisk
walk (24 miles) arrive back
in time for breakfast in the
Union. There's a very good
pick-up service if you don't
make it all the way, too. (On
the basis that having sex is
equivalent to a 4 mile walk,
you can have it six times on
Friday night!) Remember,
Carnival needs your feet.
Carnival collections are
doing well this term—you've
collected the incredible total
of £1,212 so far. Guilds are
doing best with £595, fol-
lowed by R.C.S. with £531
and Mines with £86(?),'
Don't forget that raffle
tickets are being distributed
soon, so take some and flog
them to everyone—relatives,
friends and especially ene-
mies.

Astounding
Editor Resigns
Having stoically borne the
strain of editing Felix this
term, Malcolm Williamson
is nevertheless resigning after
this issue, subject to ratifica-
tion by the Publications
Board, in order to pursue
his neglected academic
career.
His place will be taken
next term by Mr. Ian Carr,
mathematician and journa-
list extraordinary, under
whose direction Felix will be
published until Easter.

Special Student Rate
N.U.S. Conference
continued from page 1
members in teacher training
establishments should hold a
one day strike in co-
operation with the teachers'
unions.
Among other matters dis-
cussed were the question of
discipline in colleges and
universities, c o m m u n i t y
action from students, the
situation in Northern Ireland
and the Springboks. The
conference at this point mili-
tantly sent Jack Straw to
watch a rugby match.
The I.C. representatives
felt that the main value of
the conference was in the
number of contacts made
with other colleges and the
experience exchanged in
matters affecting I.C. stud-
ents. At a cost of only £9 for
the round trip, I.C. seems to
have got real value for
money.
Zebras at I.C.
On November 27 at 3.30
a.m. the almost asleep I.C.
President was phoned up in
his room and informed by a
very leading minesman that
a hardboard zebra crossing
had been successfully laid
opposite Mech. Eng. He was
looking forward to crossing
it before meeting the Queen
—but no! It had gone in the
morning. Rumour has it that
a certain Mr. H . C. J. George
(assistant secretary of the
College) was s n o o p i n g
around checking up before
the Queen came"and follow-
ing some discussions involv-
ing the word " policeman "
somebody or other moved
the great thing.
Barker you failed! Paint it
next time!

More Letters

many academic staff, using
Article II of the Royal Char-
ter as an excuse.
Article II of the Royal
Charter states that:—
"The purposes of Imperial
College are to give the
highest specialised instruc-
tion and to provide the
fullest equipment for the
most advanced training
and research in various
branches of science espe?
cially in its application to
industry . . ."
The Student Union feels
that the interpretation of
this is too narrow.
Your Majesty has the
power, according to Article
IX of the Royal Charter to
change the Charter. The Stu-
dents' Union humbly re-
quests that you consider this
proposition, and that any
change should encourage a
community which will give
"an overall view of know-
ledge and promote a more
critical, socially aware and
socially responsible atti-
tude".
Once again, on behalf of
the Students' Union, I humb-
ly request that Your Majesty
considers using your powers
to change the Charter and
using your many direct and
indirect influences to pro-
mote the expressed aspira-
tions of the Students of Im-
perial College.
I have the honour to re-
main, Madam, Your Maj-
esty's most humble and
obedient subject,
PIERS R. CORBYN,
President,
Imperial College Students'
Union.
