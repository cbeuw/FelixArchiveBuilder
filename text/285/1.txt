After two months of full
use, the college block was
finally and officially opened
last Thursday by Her Maj-
esty the Queen, accompanied
by Prince Philip.
The opening ceremony to-
gether with the unveiling of
the plaque, took place in
the Great Hall which was
crowded out for the occa-
sion.
The Queen was due to
arrive at 3.30, and whilst
the platform party was being
presented outside, those in-
side the hall were being
treated to some fine organ
playing from the organist
from Salisbury Cathedral.
This gave an ideal chance
to judge the quality of acous-
tics in the Hall; and accord-
ing to reports from various
position in the hall it is in-
deed very high.
The Student Bedell (Keith
Guy), complete with mortar
board and staff, then her-
alded the approaching plat-
form party, n u m b e r e d
amongst whom were Her
Majesty, Prince Philip, Lords
Sherfield and Penney, Ed-
ward Short, Sir Dennis
Logan (Principal of U.L.)
and Piers Corbyn. The party
having reached the platform,
the National Anthem was
sung (at least by some of the
audience), and Lord Sher-
field proceeded to welcome
the Queen to the college.
In his speech, which was
incredibly badly delivered,
Lord Sherfield brought atten-
tion to the relations between
the Queen's ancestors and
Imperial College. He went
on to give details of the de-
velopment of I.C. and men-
tioned the growth in the last
17 years from 1650 full-time
students and an annual
budget of £834,000 to 4000
students and a budget of
£7,500,000. He stressed that
despite the magnitude of the
expansion, the college had
not only maintained but had
improved its academic per-
formance.
After a short mention of
the people who made this
possible, Lord Sherfield
asked the Queen to unveil
the plaque. In her speech
before the unveiling, the
Queen made references to
her trips to the Science
Museum as a child. She then
proceeded to unveil the
plaque by remote control, at
which point there were mur-
murs of laughter throughout
the audience, followed by a
silence in anticipation of it
failing to work.
In his speech of thanks to
the Queen, Lord Penney
traced the earlier history of
the college. He mentioned
that the foundation stone of
the Royal College of Chem-
istry (the oldest constituency
part) was laid in 1845 by the
Prince Consort. The College,
Lord Penney said, was
founded to train students
and to undertake research in
science and technology. This
purpose was still the same,
but he felt that the students
"mainly by their own efforts
but with assistance from us"
have managed to extend
their horizons beyond their
disciplines.
The Queen's procession
then left the hall, and Her
Majesty was shown around
the libraries contained in the
college block. On returning
to the Students' Common
Room to join the assembled
throng in tea, the Queen was
handed a letter (the copy of
which appears on this page)
and a pamphlet comprising
the Union's feelings on Rep-
resentation and Diversifica-
tion. This was immediately
handed to her private secre-
tary but in Her conversation
over tea she promised to re-
ply to the President after
cogitation and consultation.
The Queen stayed for an
extra 20 minutes engaged in
conversation on Union poli-
cies, 3rd world and the U.S.
moon project.

Piers Corbyn handing over the Union's letter on Diversification and Representation at Imperial College to
the Queen during her visit. A full text of the letter appears below.
The Letter
May it please Your Majesty,
On behalf of the Students'
Union of Imperial College I
write to outline the students'
aspirations and situation in
Imperial College and humb-
ly request that you use your
influence to promote the ex-
pressed wishes of that stu-
dent body.
The Student Union has a
number of policies consis-
tent with the idea of creat-
ing a socially relevant co-
adult academic community.
The creation of such a com-
munity necessitates student
participation and representa-
tion at all levels in the Col-
lege, and the changing of the
specialised courses in the
College.
The main fields which the
policies of the Student Union
cover are: Diversification of
the narrow and highly spe-
cialised education of Im-
perial College; Representa-
tion on academic policy
making bodies and on the
Governing Body; and the
impending visit of the Archi-
tectural Association.
It is explained in the Stu-
dents' Union document re-
cently published "Diversifi-
cation and Representation in
Imperial College" — a copy
of which accompanies this
letter — that very slow pro-
gress has been made in ful-
filling these policies.
On Diversification some
small success is coupled with
a backward looking attitude
by many professors.
On Representation on the
Board of Studies — which is
the academic policy making
body—Students' Union poli-
cies have been largely ig-
nored.
On Representation on the
Governing Body and its Fin-
ance and Executive Commit-
tee, we have been offered
some observer status but
only in a restricted field of
discussion.
As far as the Architec-
tural Association is con-
cerned, we know that the
negotiations have reached a
crucial stage but are not rep-
resented on them. Further we
fear that many of the good
processes in the Architec-
tural Association Commu-
nity may be lost when they
join Imperial College.
The Students' Union hopes
very much that you will con-
sider its proposals and do
what you can to help pro-
mote its aspirations.
On the question of Diver-
sification some professors
ignore the overwhelming
feelings of the students and

N.U.S. Conference
B y o u r E d u c a t i o n
M a r t i n
For the first time in many
years I.C. was able to send
a delegation to an NUS con-
ference. At very short notice
the External Affairs Com-
mittee decided to send a
triumvrate of Piers Corbyn,
Dave Wield and Alan Laff-
erty to observe two days of
the four day conference. Pre-
dictably these three worthies
arrived half a day before a
party at which careful nego-
tiations achieved voting
rights for I.C., despite our
non-payment of fees.
The delegation attended
a number of debates on the
two days for which they
were at the conference. One
of the most important and
informative of these con-
cerned student grants. It was
pointed out that over the
past seven years the value
of an undergraduate grant
had decreased in real terms
by 16 per cent. The Govern-
ment had repeatedly said
that the economic situation
made this necessary and that
the grant would be reviewed.
Conference felt that now
the economic situation was
improving, it was time for
the Government to think our
standard of living back to
its previous level. The feel-
ings of delegates were
summed up by the new NUS
C o r r e s p o n d e n t ,
B l a n d
President, Jack Straw, who
said, "Now I am simple man.
I have always believed
Mr. Wilson as an honest
man. (Laughter). I believed
him when he told us — in
1965 and 1968 — that the
economic situation was so
bad as to restrict our in-
crease. I believe him now,
and Mr. Jenkins, when they
tell us that the economic
situation is improving." It
was decided that the execu-
tive should draw up fresh
evidence to submit to the
minister concerning the fin-
ancial straits of students.
This motion was supported
by the I.C. delegation, in
accordance with Union
policy.
Another subject of con-
cern to conference was tea-
chers' pay. It was decided
that the whole structure of
teachers' pay should be in-
vestigated by the exec, and
as much information as pos-
sible be brought to a future
conference. This was also
supported by I.C., since the
Union had passed a motion
on this subject a week
earlier. This is, of course, a
matter of importance to I.C.
in view of the number of I.C.
students who go on to teach.
It was also decided that
