JAZZ EXPO '69
Jazz Expo '69 took place
in the last week of October.
It's the third Jazz Expo
concert — the other two
were called Jazz Exo '67
and Jazz Expo '68. They last
a week, and always have at
least one concert of 'Jazz
from a Swinging Era' star-
ring the George Wein A l l
Stars among others (they
had two of these this year),
a blues package, one avant
garde band and other in-
numerable people — some
quite good, some excellent,
and some bad.
I only went to two of the
concerts — both small group
contemporary jazz. The first,
on the Friday night featured
Alan Skidmore, Cecil Tay-
lor and Thelonious Monk —
the Saturday concert starred
Jon Hendricks, Mary Lou
Williams and Miles Davis.
The Friday night concert
started with the Alan Skid-
more Quintet. They played
continuously. Next on were
the Cecil Taylor Quar-
tet. They were excellent.
Again 45 minutes continuous
music. This was free from
jazz — i.e. it was complex
improvisation based on an
ordered structure.
The top of the bill act
were the Thelonious Monk
Quartet. Monk was one of
the people who started be-
bop (i.e. modern jazz as we
know it). He was noted
partly for the excellent
tunes he wrote, but above
all, for his unpredictability.
That night the tunes were
there in force, not the un-
predictability. They came out
with some standard theme
that the audience applauded.
The tenorist played a couple
of choruses, then Monk did
the same, then the bassist
played a walk, if you were
lucky you got a short drum
solo and they finished off
with the theme again. They
did this for every number.
It was a great let down.
Saturday's concert started
45 minutes late because the
first house overran due to
one of the musicians turning
up late, so there was a big
crowd of a thousand people
in the foyer pushing to gelt
to their seats.
The show started at ten
o'clock with Jon Hendricks
and the Reg Powell Quartet.
Hendrix is famed as the
leader of the now non-
existent vocal ease group,
Lambert, Hendrix and Ross
(that's Annie Ross) which
was very good, but on his
own he did a poor set.
And then came Miles.
This part is terribly difficult
to review. What can you say
about a genius? Miles Davis
had a regular quintet for a
few years, a really outstand-
ing group. Unfortunately
they broke up last year, and
a new group was formed.
One could be forgiven for
thinking that this group,
having played together for
such a short time might be
a trifle disappointing in com-
parison with the other one.
I don't think that anyone
anticipated that they would
be better.
Once again the perfor-
mance was continuous. This
was very important because
the excitement just built and
built in the 75 minutes that
they played. Wayne Shorter
played soprano sax as well
as tenor. I have no idea how
long he has been playing
soprano for — I know of no
recording of him playing,
but his use of the instrument
ranked him with past masters
like Sidney Becket and John
Coltrane. The marvellous
thing about him is that when
following a Miles Davies
solo he just continues with
Miles' idea — there is a sort
of telepathy between them.
Anyone else would be shown
up beside someone of the
brilliance of Miles, but
Wayne Shorter fits perfectly.
Their partnership could be
compared to that of Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
in the early fifties.
There's not much left to
say about Miles himself. I
confess I had never realised
just how good he really is.
The sound of the trumpet
soaring above everything
else simply tears through
you. It is probably true to
say that Miles Davis is at
his peak now, which is why
it is very important that
everyone who likes any form
of jazz or pop music — in
fact anything in rhythm —
takes every opportunity to
see him now. If he doesn't
come over here, then go to
the States to see him—it's
worth it, so you can tell your
grandchildren that you saw
the legendary Miles Davies
perform.

UNDERGROUND WITH XRIS
Bo Widerberg has brought
us once again a com-
passionate heart rending
story almost too unreal to
believe. He portrays a situa-
tion that brought down a
government and changed the
whole pattern of industrial
relations in Sweden. Like
Elvira Madigan, Adalen 31
is visually beautiful and has
many fine touches, like the
sweet little child blowing
bubbles and the adolescent
youth trying to undress his
girl friend under hypnosis.
At times the action seems
indecisive until the climax
is reached with the final
march to Linden. What lives
with one is the horror of the
slaying of five innocent law
abiding people, one of whom
was a pretty little girl, a
passerby caught between a
hail of bullets.
Who would believe that a
peaceful demonstration by
men, women and children
would evoke such a reac-
tion? Who would have ex-
pected a squad of soldiers
to open fire on such a
slender pretext — maybe
there's a moral there . . . All
through the film we are
shown young people grow-
ing up oblivious or possibly
bewildered by all the turmoil
going on around. The
struggles of a family striving
just for survival, the hard-
ships of a mother—poignant
little details, which make one
feel deeply for the father
and sympathetic with his
cause — and then he is
gunned down — the strike
forgotten, life goes on except
for the martyrs. Does it
always need a death to bring
a change and lessen hard-
ship?
True Theatre
PHOENIX magazine out
on January 12th, 1970 has
been covering the theme
"Underground" for this
issue and one of the subjects
that inevitably came up was
"Underground Cinema". In
the commercial movie houses
the product offered for
viewing has usually been
edited to perfection and en-
shrined in shrouds of well-
defined mores and taboos.
To counter this the indpen-
dants arrived and gave vent
to the freedom of the Under-
ground movement and pro-
duced material which re-
quires almost infinite
patience for its enjoyment.
Boredom is the media
through which they work.
The ideal of a set theme
disappears completely and
is replaced to a certain ex-
tent by spontaneous actions
— sometimes called true
theatre. For people who
wish to be bored or ex-
perimented with, the follow-
ing plaes may prove of in-
terest.

Ordered
Chaps
Wellsoc's spectacular for
1969 was Colonel B. D.
Shaws "Explosions" lecture,
a procession of flashes,
bangs and collapsing shields
which he has been perform-
ing since time immemorial.
The Chemistry main lecture
theatre was packed full of
eager students who were not
disappointed in waiting.
He started with simple
physical explosions, at least
they seem small in com-
parison to what was to
follow. No atom bombs, but
a little opera singing, a few
slides, and a funny anecdote
every other minute. He
demonstrated the fire-power
of an antique pistol and
rifle, using the latter to fire
a tallow candle through three
thicknesses of plywood, and
finished the display with a
speech from Shakespeare
and the simultaneous firing
of two Very pistols.
Those left alive and in
full possession of all their
nerve and both ears left the
lecture theatre having seen
one of the most professional
displays of showmanship to
be put on by Wellsoc this
term.
INFORMATION
Living in London has its own drawbacks, but lack of
anything to do, or anywhere to go, is not one of them (pro-
vided you've got some grant left.) The streets are littered
with shops selling unusual items; Kensington Market you
already know about, but if you cross High Street Ken.
from there and wander westwards to Kensington Church
Street, up there you will find The Bodkin.
There is a large selection of posters on show, costing the
usual high prices, but the advantage is that the shop is within
walking distance. Anyone who has lived in the usual prison
cell known as a Hall of Residence room will appreciate the
need for decoration, and posters are one way; magazine
photographs are another, but you have to get hold of the
magazines.
Coloured posters are usually best, although they cost more,
and these are in plentiful supply at The Bodkin and several
other shops: Indica, 102 Southampton Row, sells the cheapest
posters at 5/- and 10/-, and sells the widest stock of under-
ground magazines and Arts mags/newspapers I know of.
They don't sell Ambit, but you can buy that at Karnaks,
Gloucester Road. Indica posters are cheap but not a very
wide range. Athena Reproductions, Oxford Street is for
the artistically minded people with well-lined pockets. It's
a good shop, east of Oxford Circus, on the southside. To
reach it you'll pass Harlequin Record Stores, which has a
very wide range at puzzlingly varied prices. Some of the
posters are three times the price they are at Indica, others
are cheaper than anywhere else.
Finally, the poster shop in Campden Passage is way out in
Islington and also has a very wide range, probably the widest
to be found, but it costs 2/- there and back on the tube. Still
worth a visit on a wet afternoon.
Best advice is to look around before spending any money,
that way you won't waste too much hard-unearned cash.
Long-haired lefties please note, IC barber shop is open
Tuesday 9 a.m.—5 p.m., it costs 3/-, on the second floor of
the Union building. A gentle hint, Piers?
RECORD
REVIEWS
Jody Grind
"One Step On"
TRA 210
This three man group is
one prominent in the Trans-
atlantic rock revival. How-
ever, "Rock & Roll Man",
one of the tracks, seems to
be a carbon copy of "Johnny
B Goode" and this tar-
nishes any originality the
record has. The first side is
devoted to a combination of
four tracks, including "Paint
It Black", collectively en-
titled "One Step On". Tim
Hinkley is a good organist,
but tends to sink into the
background on the second
side, containing mostly hard
rock numbers, to give way
to Ivan Zagni on guitar. The
group gives a good live per-
formance but the record is
somewhat disappointing.
Mott The Hoople
ILPS 9108
The first striking point
about this record is the
similarity between lead
vocalist Ian Hunter and Bob
Dylan. This comes out es-
pecially on tracks penned by
Hunter, namely "Backslid-
ing Fearlessly" and "Half
Moon Bay". This similarity
is no mean feat and is to
be complimented as it is just
one facet of the group. The
wild treatment of "You
Really Got Me" and the rock
compositions by Mick
Ralphs, lead guitarist, of
"Rock & Roll Queen" and
"Rabbit Foot and Toby
Time" are even more credit-
able and then a really good
seven minute version of
Sonny Bono's "Laugh at
Me" brings their skill to the
fore. The track penned by
producer Guy Stevens, en-
titled "Wrath and Wroll" is
overshadowed by the rest
and is not to be taken as
standard for the group.
Roy Harper
"Flat Baroque and
Berserk" SHVL 766
Pictured on the sleeve as
being at the mercy of a tiger,
Roy seems to have chosen a
good cross section of his
music for this record. I am
glad that he included "I Hate
The White Man", as it sums
up all his feelings about to-
day's society. Some of the
words run smoothly, par-
ticularly "Another Day",
"Song of the Ages" and
"Goodbye", which demon-
strates what a good poet he
is. He plays electric guitar
on "Hells Angels" and
proves how well he can
handle the instrument, while
a harp on "Songs of the
Ages" and recorder on "Tom
Tiddler's Ground" provide
appropriate backing. Part of
the record was recorded live
at Cousins and is his best
to date.
