No Free Beer For
British
Dear Sir,
What does George X really know about the social
problems of an overseas student, who has, probably, not
only left home for the first time to go to university, but is
doing so over the other side of the Earth! The objects of
O.S.C. parties, amongst other functions, are to provide
a special opportunity for overseas students to mix and
socialise, particularly with women, with a maximum of
ease and minimum expense (free admission, free food,
cheap beer). A large number of overseas students who come
to O.S.C. parties are never to be seen at other parties around
college.
Has George X imagined the consequences of advertising
such a party around College — PARTY, FREE
ADMISSION, FREE FOOD, CHEAP BEER — without
stipulating overseas students only? Does George X know
that O.S.C. makes a loss per head on students coming to
these parties? Does he therefore think that O.S.C. can afford
to have a party swamped by British students after a free
party, food and cheap beer? Does he think that O.S.C. can
accommodate such large numbers? Does he think it fair that
British 'Casanovas' should scoop the women from, perhaps,
slightly more inhibited overseas students, who are, perhaps,
conscious of their language difficulties, and their presence
in a foreign country.
And just to put himself further into disrepute, George
X has maliciously used this issue as the foundation for a
scathing attack on overseas students in general. Does he
realise that NOT ONE OVERSEAS STUDENT had a part
in the decision of the inclusion of the 'overseas students
only' insert on the posters?
Now maybe George X will ask, 'Well, what's the point
of holding a party to help overseas students socialise, if
there aren't any British students there?" Well, to an over-
seas student there are other foreigners apart from the
British! In fact, they're meeting British (male) students every
day. Who they're not meeting are British (female) students,
who they will meet at an O.S.C. party. In fact, I would
also like to point out that there are British members of
the Overseas Students Committee, including myself, AND
that all Council members and members of the Welfare
Committee — majority British groups, who would turn out
to be the most useful acquaintances for overseas students
— were invited.
I must apologise to overseas students in the College if I
sound paternal. I do not mean to be.
Yours faithfully, Clive Robinson
Chairman, Union Overseas
Students Committee
GAC Assimakis
Past Chairman, O.S.C.
Overseas Student's
Reservations
Dear Sir,
A close examination of all that has been happening
in writing and in action in the college campus involving
overseas students has compelled me as an overseas student
to make this humble contribution.
Recently, I have noticed a great deal of affection shown
by the union towards the overseas students. While I admire
their intention, I do not support their over-enthusiasm on
these matters.
The directive to the local landladies on matters of
accommodation was not a wise decision. Many local students
are as much new to London as many overseas students and
can hardly be expected to appreciate this drastic measure
at the cost of their own difficulties in finding suitable
accommodation. So, I suggest that accommodation problems
of all students, irrespective of whether local or overseas
students should be handled by an ' Accommodation Com-
mittee whose efforts should be based on persuasion.
Similarly, I feel embarrassed by the special party given
for the overseas students only (??). I would support any
effort to encourage the overseas students to take part in
general union activities, but I would not support the idea
of giving a special status to overseas students because this
causes misunderstanding amongst many local students.
At the end, I specially request George X to come and
discuss with me on the topics which have infuriated him
recently.
Yours sincerely, Ashok Chakrabarty

1: Opposition
Dear Sir,
Referring to the Union
Meeting of 25 November
when Mr. Muller's motion
concerning links with South
Africa and racialist coun-
tries was mutilated and
slung out.
I receive a scholarship
from a South African Com-
pany and am Anti-Apar-
theid. Am I hypocritical?
I would gladly sacrifice
my scholarship if I thought
I would achieve anything
by doing so.
Opposition to the South
African regime must not
only be verbal purely to
ease one's own conscience.
Action must be taken with-
in the country to set up an
opposition that will OPPOSE
the fascist Nationalists.
By accepting their money
I put myself in a position
to go back to that evil
country to do something
positive. By refusing their
money, I could ease my
conscience, achieve nothing,
and know damn well that
£400 was going to some
capitalist sucker, prepared
to vegetate in the sunshine
and further the ends of
Vorster's Gang.

2: Ignorance
Dear Sir,
I have been moved to
write about what I consider
to be an unwelcome and dis-
turbing development. At the
last Union meeting (Tues.
25th) there was present a
group who proceeded to
obstruct and disrupt, their
personal antagonism to the
chair was apparent and
overshadowed all else.
With regard to the motion
on South Africa a case
could have been put forward
against this motion, and for
those against this was the
obvious and sensible thing
to do. But instead, the
motion was amended to dis-
tort it completely and render
it almost meaningless.
The confusion and ignor-
ance apparent at the meet-
ing, regarding links and con-
nections with South Africa
makes the desirability of
clarification and information
obvious and perfectly
reasonable.
I welcome attendance of
more and more people at
Union meetings, iand also
recognise the organisation
of groups of similar view-
point as being legitimate
and not undesirable, but I
sincerely plead for a more
reasonable and constructive
attitude in future Union
meetings.
Yours,
D. G. lones

Community Action
Dear Sir,
Imperial College largely stands in the City of Westminster,
a city of contrasts, and one of a tremendous diversity of
human situations and human needs. It is not difficult to
imagine in what areas the needs are greatest and most
neglected, but contentment is not necessarily determined
by affluence.
Within college we already have natural groups of people.
These are in halls, student houses, departments and societies.
Groups of people from different staircases, halls or depart-
ments have the immediate opportunity to show their concern
in the local communities. A swimming club for handicapped
children requires people to help dress and undress the
children and in instructing them to swim. After being accep-
ted at the union meeting the Motorway Scheme requires
people to determine the needs local to the motorway in
North Paddington and then to bring pressure to bear upon
the authorities. Further many clubs and societies in colleges
are able to share their interests to advantage among youth
clubs, schools or among old people.
Last Tuesday 'Community Action' was initiated in the
formation of a steering group of 6. Their function is four-
fold. Firstly to stimulate action within halls and societies,
second to liaise with the relevant social agencies, thirdly
to liaise with the relevant committees in college and lastly
to liaise with other local colleges. They have already decided
to concentrate their interests, but not exclusively, on North
Paddington, where there is a particular lack of social agen-
cies. Through tackling specific social needs we may become
as a college aware of much larger but hidden needs and
problems in society. It is hoped that before Christmas 2 or
3 groups will see some action. What can you and your
friends, in hall or your society, do, maybe with our help,
in the new year?
Yours sincerely,
Keith Lindsey, John Butterworth, Brian Hains,
Doug Irish, Jonathan Moont, Mike Muller.

Policies,
Not
Personalities
Dear Sir,
There is a certain negative
attitude prevailing among
some sections of the Union.
Their method is to attack
personalities rather than pol-
icies. At the last count there
were three censure motions
on Mr. Corbyn for the next
Union meeting today, Thurs-
day.
These motions do not con-
cern themselves with major
policies of the Union. No-
one is criticising Mr. Cor-
byn for pursuing the poli-
cies of non-technical diversi-
fication, representation, or
support for the Architectural
Association. His major cri-
tics won't even explain
coherently why they have
become so bitter.
Our President was elected
on a mandate of progressive
and positive policies. These
include broadening of cour-
ses, representation on the
Board of Studies, and grea-
ter involvement of Union
members. No-one can sug-
gest that he has gone back
on any of these policies. No-
one can suggest that he has
lost Union support on them.
Those people who support
the Union's major policies
must support him at the
Union meeting today.
Yours faithfully,
Dave Wield.
