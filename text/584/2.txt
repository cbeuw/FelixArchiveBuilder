Letters
to the
Editor
Dear Sir
O n Tuesday lunchtime, like
many others, I went along lo the
Great H a l l . Most of the audience
listened to M r s Shirley Williams.
But not lor me the polities behind
Britain's newest party. N o , I
enjoyed the erratic clatter of a
camera shutter. It didn't really
ruin a line talk. I should have
brought along m y camera then
people would watch me instead
ol the speaker. I could forget all
manners a n d even dazzle the
audienee as I photographed M r s
W i l l i a m s from b e h i n d . But I
didn't because it would have
denied the pleasure of the dick
that did.

Dear Ed
D u r i n g m y s e m i - e n e b r i a t e d
w a n d e r i n g s between the a l e -
houses of South Kensington a
d i s t u r b i n g e c o n o m i c fact has
filtered through to m y addled
brain. It has come to m y atten-
t i n t h a t b e t w e e n 8 : 0 0 a n d
9:30pm. for seven days a week,
the N o r f o l k H o t e l , s i t u a t e d
conveniently close to the Institute
Franca is. is selling Fullers Pride.
Sam Smiths and Ruddles County
for fifty pence a pint. T h e first
two of these beverages are also
available i n Stan's Bar for fifty-
seven pence a pint.
At first my suspicious mind
wondered if the patrons of Stan's
were being ripped off. but alter
further mental exercise I realised
that, with Rae Snee looking alter
our interests, this could not be so.
At last week's U G M I asked Rae
to explain this disturbing dis-
crepancy and she said that it was
caused by "College inefficiency".
H o w , I w o n d e r , s h o u l d t h e
residents of Southside react to
this "inefficient y".' Personally. I
have taken to boycotting Stan's
between the hours of 8:00 to
, 9:30pm. However, if my absence
I has been noted It has probably
been blamed on Geoffrey Howe's
budget or o u r imminent bowel
disrupting examinations.
A recent C o n Soe poll has
shown that Rae Slice s popularity
is not p a r t i c u l a r l y h i g h . R a r
could rectify this situation by

Dear Sir
R e c e n t l y a little p u b l i c i s e d
m e e t i n g o f the I C S t u d e n t s '
Residence Committee resolved
" t h a t i n a l l o c a t i n g w o m e n ' s
places between the various Halls
a n d Houses, a percentage o f
between 25% and 30% should be
aimed a l in each of the mixed
residences" (Item 7.1. minutes of
the Students Residence C o m m i t -
tee, 4 M a r c h 1981). The "details
of h o w the places s h o u l d be
distributed" were left for future
consideration by a sub-committee
constituted from the members of
the S R C . This sub-committee
met. and concluded its delibera-
tions over the Easter vacation,
without informing or seeking the
opinions of non-members with a
proper interest in the changes
proposed, and before the minutes
of M a r c h 4 S R C Meeting were
p u b l i s h e d . It was d e c i d e d lo
increase the number of mixed
male and lemale Halls to six (to
include Weeks a n d Tizard. as
well as Beit, Selkirk. Linstead
and Falmouth).
It is m y o p i n i o n that t h e
i n i t i a l , i n n o c e n t s o u n d i n g ,
proposal accepted by S R C . in
fact concealed a significant and
alarming shift of policy. Il has.
until now. been the ease thai
p r i m a r i l y t h r e e H a l l s ( B e i l .
Selkirk and Falmouth) have been
designated as mixed, a n d have
had roughly equal proportions of
men and women. Linstead Hall
has r e c e n t l y b e c o m e p a r t l y
mixed. It seems that now we are
to share the women in residence
(the total number of whom will
be kepi roughly constant), rather
l i k e c h o c o l a t e s , a m o n g s t t h e
majority of IC Halls.
Undoubtedly the practice of
m i x i n g m e n a n d w o m e n i n
residence is one thai improves the
quality of life in Halls, and would
be endorsed equally by both men
and women. This improvement
can. however, only be realised if
b o t h m e n a n d w o m e n exist
together i n a balanced society. 1
1
seems then u n l i k e l y that the
p r e v i o u s l y a l l - m a l e residences
will derive significant benefits by
introducing a handful of women.
Il is one of the less appealing
aspects of life al I C thai women
are in a minority. There is a
c o n t i n u a l awareness amongst
women of their minority status; a
feeling reinforced by the be-
haviour a n d opinions of their
male colleagues. The only pans
ol College society where women
have been integrated into normal
balanced societies are Selkirk,
Beil and Falmouth. The S R C has
ordered the destruction of societies
and is demanding the restoration of
the g e n e r a l i m b a l a n c e . T h e
consequences of these actions will
benefit no one; they will succeed
only in exacerbating the already
difficult position of women al
IC.
In my opinion, thai of the Beit
H a l l Students' Residence C o m -
mittee, and a substantial number
ol both men and women students,
serious errors have been made by
the S R C both i n the nature of
the changes made, and in the
manner in which they have been
brought about.
W e w o u l d a l l d o w e l l to
remember that the issues involved
are primarily social, not political
or arithmetical. The social group
most s i g n i f i c a n t l y affected by
these changes will be women,
and therefore the planning ol
such changes should carefully
consider the opinions of women
themsleves. The S R C lias patently
failed to seek the o p i n i o n ol
women students (or of anyone
else).
I hope that this letter will
initiate serious consideration of
the issues raised by all students,
and especially women students,
and will result in jmhlic discussion
ol questions which relate lo us all.

Dear Sieve
W h i l s t I i m m e n s e l y e n j o y
reading your paper I find that it
does tend to be very long and I
sometimes have to spend Satur-
day and Sunday leafing through
articles I've no time lo read.
There is so much paper you see
and I become immersed in a
p r o f u n d i t y o f d e s c r i p t i v e a n d
a n i m a t e d d e t a i l w h i c h c a n
absorb me for hours a n d even
d a y s as i n t h e ease o f t h e
w o n d e r f u l e d i t i o n o f M a y 8.
Therefore, do bear in mind this
when editing your marvellous
journal.

Dear Sir
O n Thursday, M a y 7 I found
the U n i o n Refectory still closed
ai 15:40pm.
Some time alter 15:45pm I
finally found the door open, and
I was the first successful customer
(of a handful of hungry souls who
bad been regularly trying tIn-
doors for the previous quarter ol
an hour).
O n leaching the counter and
asking for (hips I was asked to
wait l o r a levy m i n u t e s , a n d
before my eyes a basket of frozen
pieces of potato was introduced
to the fat.
Soon I was no longer alone at
the counter. The young man who
had been given charge of the
r e l u c t a n t w o u l d - b e " c h i p s "
appeared anxious lest bis clients'
patience be unduly tried. By now
it was painfully predictable thai
the c h i p s for w h i c h we b a d
waited so long would be — of all
things — underdone: and so it
iranspired at 15:52pm.
I made my best attempt at a
wistful smile while disposing of
the long-awaited soggy things.
