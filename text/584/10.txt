What's On
Clever that I am, I detected a tinge of sarcasm
in M r Tolstoy's letter today. Y o u thought last
week's issue short measure at only six pages,
didn't you? Others have not been slow to
express similar views.
Is it not unfair of you to expect me to feel
inspired to produce lively, witty, entertaining
multi-paged journalism every week? J o h n
Passmore and Rae Snee have been dull all
year, I was only dull last week—it's just not on,
chaps!
I've had my fair share of news making, but I
feel that the onus is really on Y O U to do things
for F E L I X to report. Okay, so lots of people
are revising—fair enough, but most of them
have been revising since they were born.
Students at IC seem to spend the first two
terms practising to be boring in the third term.
Maybe you're all just naturally boring people
and I expect too much of you. This College
may turtt out some highly qualified graduates
but most are so bloody dull! O n the other
hand, you have the tediously slow-witted
members of Union Council, most of whom
exude stupidity as if it were a virtue (e.g. Rich
Archer).
A Protest Song
(To be sung to the tune of Anarchy in the UK)
Why doesn't someone commit suicide?
Kill a few Iranians?
Or disfigure John Passmore?
Let's stir up a bit of interest
Let's throw eggs at Victor Mooney
Let's break the Rector's windows,
And Captain Lindley's legs.
Let's call a spade Dare Afolabi
A feminist an emasculated man
A n d Princess Anne a piece of puss.
Let's boycott refectories
Vomit in Sherfield lifts as a protest
And tell Victor Mooney
Just where to put his baked mince beef roll.
C'mon, Let's go.

Min and Met Soc Lecture by
JOE GORMLEY
President of the National U n i o n of M i n e W o r k e r s
Monday, May 18 at 4:30pm, Mining LT, RSM.
Not far from Weatherspoon's cottage there is
a long, straight path which crosses a bridge
over a long, straight section of river. The path
is not at right angles to the river, and the land
in the acute angle between the two has been
W e a t h e r s p o o n ' s allotment for as long as
anyone can remember.
O n the allotment there is an old pig-sty (a
mathematical 'point' pig-sty, with position, but
no size or shape) and Weatherspoon is toying
with the idea of getting some fences together,
and building a pig-pen to keep a pig in.
N o w , the pig must be able to get to his sty.
A n d he must be able to get to the river, so that
he will have a ready supply of fresh drinking
w a t e r . A n d it w o u l d be c o n v e n i e n t for
Weatherspoon if he could get to the pen from
the path without c r o s s i n g the rest of his
allotment; in other words, the pen must extend
up to the path.
But fences are expensive, and Weather-
spoon wants to keep the total cost of the pen
as low as -possible, so can you help him by
telling him how to find the positions for the
fences w h i c h will enable him to use the
shortest possible length of fencing.
N o w before you start muttering things like
"non-linear trigonometry" and reaching for
textbooks on the calculus of variations, I
should warn you that while this is the kind of
puzzle which will take several hours if you go
about it the wrong way, the right approach will
give you the answer in about fifteen seconds.
Have fun!

Congratulations to John G Murphy of M e c h
Eng 2, one of two people who submitted a
correct answer.
The problem was originally set on the maths
paper of the Cambridge entrance exams in
1970. I didn't think it was that difficult, despite
the fact that when recalling the problem for
this c o l u m n , I realised that the answer I
submitted at school, marked correct by the
maths staff, was wrong!
Anyway, this week's is easier; I don't normally
reveal the sources of puzzles I have borrowed
until after the solutions appear (for obvious
reasons) but this week I can't resist making an
exception; after a Cambridge S c h o l a r s h i p
question last week—this week's puzzle is an
old O-Level question.

There seems no end to calculated acts of injustice in
the world. For centuries suffering, torture, imprisonment
without trial and persecution for beliefs has gone on
unopposed.
Yet today a glint of light glimmers for all those
persecuted and unjustly imprisoned. The light is
called Amnesty International and it has now been
burning bright as a symbol of hope for twenty years.
UgfatmgEfaeway
Amnesty's work is effective. Amnesty has lit the way
to freedom for many thousands of prisoners by
researching, documenting and bringing to light
their individual plight to the world at large.
It is estimated that every day four
of Amnesty's adopted prisoners of
conscience are released.
And those still in prison can take
hope they have not been forgotten
Please, do not forget Amnesty
International in this its twentieth
year. Your help and support is vital.
