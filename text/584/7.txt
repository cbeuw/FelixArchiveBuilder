message will not be so widely heard, and its
important function of acting as a training
g r o u n d for y o u n g B r i t i s h a c t o r s will be
seriously impaired.
A s for the O l d Vic, it seems unlikely that the
Waterloo Bridge Road site will be unoccuppied
for long. But if one of the oldest sites of British
theatre were lost, it would be tragic.
O n a more general note, many theatres are
in trouble at the moment. This has meant plays
being run for longer, stringent economies in
costume and set design, and generally less
inovation in favour of surefire moneyspinners.

Miracle, if it works at all will be at the expense
of an artistically bankrupt Theatre.

Nothing Personal
Gig
T h e last week or two have given us an
excellent opportunity to take stock of some of
the bands we have available round College.
Last Friday's gig featured two such (Nothing
Personal and The Vegetables), while the C N D
'Benefit Hop' the week before showcased
t h r e e o t h e r I C b a s e d b a n d s w i t h T h e
Vegetables for toppers. In view of the wealth of
ideas a n d musicianship s h o w e d by these
bands, it's a crying shame that they receive so
little support from students in the College. The
C N D Benefit was well attended, but the
audience consisted almost entirely of C N D
members from outside College. The Nothing
Personal gig attracted nothing like as large an
audience. Considering the number of people
who moan about the lack of entertainment in
College, it's annoying that so few of them take
a n i n t e r e s t w h e n it's p r o v i d e d on t h e i r
doorstep.
Anyway, on to the bands. The Vegetables, a
very competent R ' N ' B band, played a set
which was unfortunately merely adequate.
That they can do much better was proven at
the C N D gig; clearly the band are very subject
to atmosphere and audience response. They
play a selection of standards and originals with a
lot of drive and enthusiasm, although they
suffer badly from the lack of a good front-line
soloist. They are a fun band to see, although
not really up to scratch last Friday.
Nothing Personal achieved a remarkably
tight sound for a band doing its first gig. Their
songs, although i n c o r p o r a t i n g technically
difficult aspects such as occasional strange
signatures, are always accessable and easy to
listen to. The use of a violin in the frontline
makes a pleasant change, and it is nicely
blended in with the rest of the band. I can't
help thinking, though, that the band are taking
it easy a lot of the time. Since they obviously
have a lot of talent, and a lot of potential,
perhaps they should be attempting things a
little more adventurous

S I N C E IT'S F O R M A T I O N last N o v e m b e r
I C C N D Group has achieved a wide base of
support (over sixty on our mailing list) and has
successfully organised a number of diverse
activities. Speakers, in conjuction with the Staff
European Nuclear Disarmament Group, include
Dr Michael Pentz of the Open University,
Christine King from National C N D , Joan Riddock
and Dr Michael McCarthy. The banned B B C
film The War Game was shown to three packed
lecture theatres (an overwhelming response); five
leaflets have been written on disarmament issues,
of which two 'Civil Defence' and 'The Arms Race'
have been published and our bookstall has been a
regular feature at many events. Last week the
C N D Benefit Carnival was attended by two or
three hundred and raised over £100. Thanks to all
who helped, especially Eric Jarvis and the bands
and disco who gave their service for free. We
hope to organise another one sometime.
Members of the Group have been active in
S A N A (Scientists Against N u c l e a r A r m s ) ,
London Student C N D and at the Student C N D
and Campaign Activists Conferences. The Group
was represented at the Easter march to N A T O
headquarters in Brussels (televised worldwide)
and at many other C N D events.
Much is planned for next year and activities are
continuing throughout the summer. Currently we
are fighting a ban on marches (theoretically
intended to restrict neo-fascist groups inciting
racial hatred) and will be 'assembling' in Glasgow
early in June. Anyone interested, either now or
next term, in supporting our fight for a rational
and economic defence policy please contact
Martin Casey, Physics P G (Optics Group).
IMPORTANT!
Overseas Student's
Health
THE G O V E R N M E N T is about to produce an
order which will disbar overseas students (except
from E E C , Russia, Poland and Yugoslavia) from
using the National Health Service.
From October 1, 1981, all overseas students
will be expected to have private insurance for
medical care. It is likely that this will not apply to
any student who has registered with a N H S
General Practitioner before October 1, 1981.
It is essential for any overseas student who is in
the country before the due date to register with a
N H S doctor. This is done by simply filling in a
form in the doctor's surgery, and making sure
that the doctor forwards the form to the local
Family Practitioners' Committee before October
1.
Any overseas students who have not registered
with a N H S doctor are advised to do so at once!

A Comment
By Frank James
LET M E FIRST of al! make it quite clear that I
consider members of C N D to be genuine
idealists, but, I regret to say, misguided, because
they have not considered all the facts relevant to
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
I agree with them that a nuclear war would be
an evil thing — a thing which every person should
work to avoid. But I also happen to think that
occupation by an enemy power is also an evil
thing. The C N D slogan "better red than dead" is
a piece of dialectic that hides the real choices that
we have concerning nuclear weapons. The slogan
to begin with shows quite clearly that C N D thinks
that the threat to our security comes from Russia
rather than from America. (I wonder what their
attitude would be towards nuclear disarmament if
America was threatening to occupy us.)
Another aspect of world strategy not taken into
account by C N D is how Russia views its potential
strategic position in a future war. R u s s i a
effectively has the same problem, albeit on a
larger scale, that Germany had up until 1945,
namely that in all probability Russia would have to
fight any future war on two fronts, viz Europe and
China, with America supplying aid to both sides.
Now the obvious solution to this problem is to
attempt to remove one of these fronts with as
little inconvenience to them as possible.
Thus we in Europe must be prepared to resist
Russian aggression to the best of our ability. This
is not a question of ideology—Russia is not a
socialist state in any sense that I would use the
term—it is a question of sheer naked power. For
a totalitarian state to exist with the support of its
population it must produce an external threat to
its security in order to justify its repression at
home. This is why many of the poor Third World
countries fight pointless wars—to maintain the
existing government in power.
The necessity for expansion and aggression is
therefore inherent in the Russian system. The
only thing that they understand is power. The
only way to prevent Russian advancement is to
possess sufficient power to persuade them that
such expansionist aims would only bring ruin
upon their own country.
This is the kernal of the theory of deterrant.
That by possessing the material strength and
poltical will to use that strength if necessary, we
persuade the Russians that it would, from their
point of view be pointless to attack us. But if we
have neither the material strength or the political
will then Russian aggression is inevitable. C N D
strikes at both of these aspects. By their very
asking for unilateral disarmament they reduce our
political will to disuade the Russians, and at the
same time endeavour to abolish our material
strength to deter them. Let me make it quite clear
that I think that by attempting to do this C N D
bring closer that event—nuclear war—which we
all abhor. The Russians would not have any moral
scruples about using nuclear weapons, especially
if they knew that we had none with which to reply.
