Deathwatch
Cert AA. Starring Romy Schneider,
Harvey Keitel. Directed by Bertrand
Tavernier. Opened yesterday at the Paris
Pullman.
Deathwatch is a n E n g l i s h l a n g u a g e
French/German made film set in Scotland in
the near future.
H o w e v e r , a d v a n c e m e n t s in the field of
medicine have been startling. Virtually all
known diseases have been eradicated such
that death only occurs by violence or old age.
Violence is familiar to everyone, especially
after "The W a r " and is hardly worth reporting
these days. O l d folks are whisked off to the
Home when they no longer respond to virilitiy
pills a n d are given drugs to reduce their
awareness of the concept of death. The drugs
often lead to premature senility but this is
thought preferable to acknowledgement of
their impending demise by the doctors who
always know best.
The absence of death from society has bred
a morbidly curious television audience. N T V
a r e q u i c k to b o o s t t h e i r r a t i n g s w i t h
Deathwatch—a programme which shows what
it is like to die "in the old way".
T e c h n o l o g y has made gigantic leaps in
television, too. The film opens with Roddy
(Harvey Keitel), an N T V producer, undergoing
the final tests on the latest e x p e r i m e n t a l
miniture camera that has just been implanted
in his head. Everything he sees will now be
r e c o r d e d o n v i d e o t a p e i n the s t u d i o .
Technology fails miserably for the sake of the
plot, however, when he is told that the camera
will blow its circuits if exposed to darkness for
more than a couple of minutes. He is advised
to c a r r y a t o r c h at all t i m e s a n d given
unsleeping pills for nightime! Roddy thinks it's
just great, a new toy to end all toys!
The main theme of the film is invasion of
privacy. Roddy doesn't immediately think in
terms of his own lack of privacy and is
delighted when told of his latest assignment—a
scoop for N T V — a woman who has just been
told by her doctor that she will soon die of a
rare disease that has escaped modern surgery
and pills.
Vincent Ferrimen (portrayed excellently by
Harry Dean Stanton) is the sick N T V director
who gives the viewers what they want. He
dispatches Roddy on the trail of the dying
Katherine Mortonhoe (Romy Schneider).
T h e plot t h i c k e n s u n d e r the s p l e n d i d
direction of Bertrand Tavernier.
Deathwatch is in the same league as Stalker
(reviewed last term), relying on development
of human emotions against a science fiction
background and is not heavily into special
effects like most S F films. Futuristic social
comments abound; some are very amusing
such as the scene where Roddy is shopping in
the supermarket against a soundtrack of a
deep feminine voice urging people not to
shoplift as they would feel bad about it later.
" Y o u r sub-lims are running slow," he tells the
cash desk girl. " D a m n , " she sighs, "they're
always doing that!"
At first, I found it difficult to believe in the
society which found the invasion of one's
privacy perfectly acceptable if it "benefitted"
the majority of the public. I would expect such a
society to be further in the future than
depicted here. O n reflection though, looking at
the ever growing number of people who can
legally invade your privacy, and the recent
Prince Charles/Lady Di phone-tapping, I think
such a society could well be formed long
before all disease could be eradicated from the
world and cameras implanted in heads (which
as a scientist, I accepted more readily). To
take the Prince Charles example, I would
e s t i m a t e most of the p e o p l e w h o were
outraged would still read the transcripts if they
were placed in easy reach. Prince Charles was
right not to maintain the Palace's usual
"dignified silence" over such a matter, for that
w o u l d have a d v a n c e d us further towards
Deathwatch.
Deathwatch is a v e r y i m p o r t a n t film,
combining piercing social comment with very
moving drama—go and see it N O W !

T O C E L E B R A T E THEIR 25th Anniversary the
Royal Court have, with help from Thomas
Kilroy, transplanted Chekhov lock, stock and
barrel to Ireland. There will, of course, be the
usual collection of diehards who beleive that
you shouldn't muck around with the classics,
but I'm sure Chekhov himself would have
loved it. What Kilroy is trying to do is draw
parallels between the two locations, Russia
and Ireland in the 1880s, abstentee landlords,
demise of rich estates. The adaptation is
skillful and complete. That well-known writer
Trigorian has become M r Astor and all other
names and references carefully "celticated".
The cast is very strong, headed by Anna
M a s s e y , a real C h e k h o v e x p e r t , with a
memorable performance in B B C ' s Cherry
Orchard to her name. The play runs untill
June 8 and student standby is £1.
Perhaps somewhat heavy for revision time is
Man and Superman at the National. Running
for over four hours with three intervals it is an
epic. It is also the best play in London. If you
thought Daniel Massey was good in Miller's
Crucible on B B C over Easter, he positively
glows in this production. The play can easily be
divided into two parts: the efforts of Ann
(Penelope Wilth) to capture the wild spirit of
her joint g u a r d i a n J o h n T a n n e r ( D a n i e l
Massey) which is stylish comedy; and the 'Don
Juan in Hell' act which gives the play its punch.
During this hour-long scene which consists of
a dialogue between Don Juan (Daniel Massey,
again) and L u c i f e r , the relative merits of
Heaven and Hell are discussed. This fills out
the conflict of ideas hinted at in the main body
of the play. If you are not totally befuddled by
the sheer mass of steely dialogue then beneath
it all you will find Shaw's message. He is
convinced that women are merely trying to
distract men from improving themselves and
society. Shaw himself never consummated his
marriage and generally lived a meager lifestyle
as if trying to lead by example.
Also at the National is Pinter's Caretaker.
This play has a special significance for me in
that it made my hometown Sidcup famous. It
became synonamous with lower-middle class
suburbia and as long as this play is performed,
will p r o b a b l y r e m a i n so. H o w e v e r , this
production has a West Indian cast. Are they
trying to transplant Sidcup into Brixton?
A word too (or perhaps two minutes silence)
for two plays you won't be able to see. The
National Youth Theatre will no longer be doing
Gotcha and Killing Time at the Shaw Theatre
and the Old Vic Company is no longer residing
in "Balcanville".
Both these companies have died due to cuts
in their Arts Council grant. It is a reflection on
Governments' fickleness towards the arts in as
much as the very year that the Barbican Arts
Centre is due to open, with a reproduction of
the Globe Theatre for the R S C ' s use, these
two w o r t h y companies are having to be
disbanded.
Of the two, the National Youth Theatre is
p o s s i b l y the most i m p o r t a n t to lose. It
specialised on bringing theatre to young
people, at low prices and with plays relevant to
them. This was probably best summed up by
their last p r o d u c t i o n . This B a r r y Keefe's
double bill showed the problems of dead-end
kids drifting into petty theft and shows the
potential social damage which is caused by
w i d e s p r e a d y o u t h u n e m p l o y m e n t . T h e
company may well survive by going back to
its roots in the pub circuit, but is important
