The Swinnerton-Dyer Report
....ICU's Response
T H E S W I N N E R T O N - D Y E R R E P O R T on the future of the non-
medical Colleges in London University is considering the
responses to its initial findings. The final report, due in July, is
likely to have as m u c h impact as d i d the Flowers Report on the
reorganisation of medical teaching in the University.
The full text of IC Union's reply is given in Council papers
and can be seen in the Union Office; the m a i n points are
outlined here.
Underlying the comments and
proposals of the p a p e r is the
aeeeptanee ol the seriousness ol
the problems lacing the Univer-
sity and ol any major changes in
its organisation which are found
necessary.
W h i l e not w e l c o m i n g a n y
p a r t i c u l a r s o l u t i o n , s e v e r a l
options are proposed and dis-
cussed within the constraints ol
basic priorities.
The overriding requirement is
the need to maintain academic
standards, across the University
and within individual Colleges.
Thus when assessing where cuts
a r e to be m a d e , P r o I e s s o r
Swinnerton-Dyer and his C o m -
mittee are urged to bear in mind
the maxim "quality not quan-
tity".
The I C U n i o n paper places the
highest priorities on vocationally
orientated subjects, particularly
industrial courses, and specialist
schools. U n i q u e institutions such
as S O A S , S S E E S , and Birkbeck
are emphasised and their status
defended, while highlighting the
need to m a i n t a i n a b a l a n c e
throughout the University.
T o achieve major savings, IC
U n i o n accepts that the closure
and sale of buildings may be
required, but stresses that such
drastic action must not strike at
the h e a r t of the U n i v e r s i t y .
Indeed the conclusion states that
"it is better to amputate a part
rather than risk the health ol the
whole body."
Before any such irreversible
steps are t a k e n , urgent steps
are should be taken to lind i m -
mediate financial savings. Each
school must examine procedures,
improve efficiency and eliminate
w a s t e . S u g g e s t i o n s i n c l u d e
decentralising the functions ol
S e n a t e H o u s e to the l a r g e r
c o l l e g e s . T h u s r e g i s t r a t i o n ,
e n t r a n c e r e q u i r e m e n t s a n d
examinations would be admin-
istered locally; while the Univer-
sity assumes the role of a central,
co-ordinating body.
The I C U n i o n response includes
strong criticism of several points
in the initial Report. Swinnerton-
Dyer predicts a drop in income of
up to 20% over ten years. Most of
this is directly due to withholding
of the " s u b s i d y " for overseas
students and the consequent fall
in t h e i r n u m b e r s . I C L n i o n
maintain that the lull effect of
this policy will be felt after only
two more years, s h o w i n g the
i m m e d i a c y of the p r o b l e m s
facing the University.
The predicted reduction in
home student numbers due to
falling birthrates is also doubted.
Indeed applications to University
may even increase, • w i t h the
e n c o u r a g e m e n t s l o r w o m e n ,
working class and mature students
to continue further education.
When necessary stall reduc-
tions should be made by natural
wastage and early retirement.
Where redundancies have to be
made, IC U n i o n proposes that
these are compulsory: voluntary
redundancy will only bring the
loss of the best academic stall.
Government money has already
been made available to ease such
changes, but IC U n i o n urges a
t h o r o u g h e x a m i n a t i o n of the
status ol academic stall.
O l c o u r s e , the p o s i t i o n ol
s t u d e n t u n i o n s a n d s t u d e n t
f a c i l i t i e s is h i g h l i g h t e d . T h e
University of London U n i o n , in
particular, is vigorously defended:
p e r h a p s t h i s o n l y s e r v e s to
emphasise its vulnerability in the
situation.
In conclusion, the IC L n i o n
response expresses the belief that
the Government has miscalcu-
lated the effects of its financial
policies, and vainly hopes for a
reprieve. It is difficult to envisage
P r o f e s s o r S w i n n e r t o n - D v e r
pleading such a ease. Whatever
conclusions are published in July,
they are bound to meet a hostile
reaction from some direction; the
Swinnerton-Dyer Committee has
an unenviable task.
