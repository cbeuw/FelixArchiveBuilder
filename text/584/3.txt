Council Report
ICU Council had a turgid, poorly attended meeting last Monday
night. Matters discussed included female residents in Halls,
and Overseas Students Committee finances.
The meeting spent hall an hour on the subject of reallocation of
female places i n ' H a l l . M r A z h a r R i z v i . Beit Sub-warden spoke to
Council asking them to dissent from Student Resident Committee
decision. However, M r J o h n Passmore (who sits on S R C ' with M a r k
Clegg and Pete Stevens from Council) proposed a motion to reaffirm
the S R C ' s decision and this was passed on a vote.
There was heated debate on the Overseas Students Committee
finances issues. At last Council Pravin Patel, O S C C h a i r m a n was asked
to present a report on it. This was not available at Council, although
M r Patel had handed one in last week. M a r k Clegg proposed at motion
ol censure on L i z Lindsey. It transpired during speeches that there bad
been a misunderstanding in the U n i o n Office, the motion was
withdrawn and L i z Lindsey photocopied M r Patcfs report. W h e n
Council saw the report, it was felt not acceptable. M r Patel was then
c e n s u r e d by C o u n c i l for the way O S C m o n e y had been spent.
P W P are to l o o k into the matter.
A n a t t e m p t to c h a n g e the e s t i m a t e s w i t h r e g a r d to S C C
subscriptions, namely that subscriptions should not be debited from
claims to College was unsuccessful. The meeting went into closed
session lo discuss the awarding of colours.
At the end of the meeting it was suggested that Capt Lindley was
only given the organisation of " M e e t I C " to slop him meddling in
anything else. This brought mild laughter from the Iwentv-two people
still left.
Davy Repossessed
at RCS AGM
O N T U E S D A Y the R C S A G M
took place. T e n minutes into the
m e e t i n g about t h i r t y M i n e r s
burst into the lecture theatre in
an attempt to retrieve Davy, the
Miners' mascot. Fire extinguish-
ers, a pick handle and a smoke
bomb were used in the attack.
After being repelled the Miners
laid seige to the room.
The meeting then continued
and the following people eleeled:
Simon Moore, lints C h a i r m a n ;
F i o n a W h i t e I a w , A s s i s t a n t
H o n o r a r y S e c r e t a r y ; F i a n k i e
Williams, Publicity Officer; Nick
L a s t , A n d \ N c e d h a m , T h e t a
bearers. Some minor posts were
also filled. In addition to the
awarding ol about fifty colours
(social and athletic).
Tansy Hepton. Nick M o r t o n ,
Steve G u n n , Paul Johnson, Steve
T y s o n a n d R i c h A r c h e r (ex-
o f f i c i o ) r e c e i v e d the U n i o n
General A w a r d which is awarded
for outstanding service to the
Union. Nick Watmough was re-
a w a r d e d the D e r y e k B o n d
M e m o r i a l A w a r d for the year's
most exceptional faux pas.
About half way through the
m e e t i n g a l a r g e n u m b e r ol
Guildsmen arrived to aid the
Miners. However. Dave G a y e r
felt the situation was potentially
violent and against the spirit of
mascotry, and so persuaded the
Guildsmen to leave.
T o avoid liuther confronta-
tions it was decided to give back
Davy for the sum of £200. The
i n e c l i n g was c l o s e d w i t h a
Kangela by the new executive

Licence to breed
money
V I E W E R S O F B B C Television's
The Risk Business will have seen
Professor Brian Hartley, former
h e a d of B i o c h e m i s t r y , b e i n g
interviewed. The program ' A
Licence to Breed M o n e y ' con-
cerned the commercialisation ol
c e r t a i n b i o c h e m i c a l processes
and the professor described his
association with one of the new
companies in the field, based in
Geneva, which has since made
him a "paper millionaire" along
with bis research in the "bowels
of Imperial College", to quote
J u d i t h H a n n , the p r o g r a m ' s
narrator.
In what has become typical of
B r i t i s h s c i e n c e p r o g r a m s , ' A
Licence to Breed Money' yet
a g a i n c o n f i r m e d that B r i t i s h
ideas hardly ever succeed in this
c o u n t r y , but e l s e w h e r e . I l
emphasised the point, by follow-
i n g a d i s c o v e r y m a d e by a
l e a d i n g O x f o r d research bio-
chemist, which has ended up
mainly in the bands of twenty
American companies alter tailing
lo be protected by the N R D C .
The prolessor was at no loss,
however, to stress that, had there
been a British company in the
field, be would have been the first
to join ibein.
Ibe program did end on an
optimistic note describing the
formal ion of a Biilish company,
who are taking on .British talent

Women in Hall
A R E C E N T discussion by the
Students Residence Committee
to reallocate the proportion of
women in Halls of residence has
provoked criticism from Beil Hall
residents. The S R C decided that
as from next year there would be
women in Tizard and Weeks
H a l l s . T h i s week M r A z h a r
R i z v i . Beit S u b - w a r d e n , has
written to F E L I X and spoken at
U n i o n Council on the subject,
and four Beit residents attempted
to make a verbal presentation to
an S R C meeting on Wednesday
afternoon. However, they were
not allowed in because it was a
closed committee, but presented
a written statement. A n edited
version is below:
" W e accept that the overall
proportion of women in residence
should reileel that of the College
as a whole, but in the interests of
the women concerned, women's
places should be concentrated in
a sufficiently small number ol
Halls and Houses to ensure a
reasonable proportion of women
in each,
II the policy proposed by the
S R C were to be adopted, the
advantages of mixing any H a l l
would be diminished; a small
minority of women would not be
sufficient to contribute positively
to the atmosphere of the Hall. In
addition, women would suffer in
H a l l under the same imbalance
of the sexes as they do in Imperial
C o l l e g e g e n e r a l l y , s o m e t h i n g
many potential women appli-
cants might find unattractive.
T h e r e are s u r e l y ways of
mixing presently single-sex Halls
and Houses without disturbing
the balanced ratio that exists in
some Halls at present.
We are concerned thai the
d e c i s i o n to r e d i s t r i b u t e the
number of women's places in
H a l l and House was made by the
S R C without consultation ol any
women students, and il is in this
light that We ask you to reconsider
your decision".
