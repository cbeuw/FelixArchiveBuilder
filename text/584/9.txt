IC GAMES 1981
The College athletics championships took place at Motspur Park, the
London University sports ground, which is presently in its jubilee year.
The G a m e s were held o n a s u n n y day early this term a n d t h e
competitors enjoyed the company of S T O I C and some students from
Charing Cross Hospital.

one pint of beer per competitor, gave them a narrow win over Guilds.

Cricket
IC lost the toss and were forced to field first in the all-day game.
Thompson opened the bowling but looked tired. Crowe at the other end
was looking mean and nasty — mind you, he always looks like that.
Crowe took two early wickets, one a simple chance to Everett a catch to
Clark. Martin Ellacott was given a bowl and looked much more like his
old self b o w l i n g l o n g - h o p s a n d full t o s s e s d o w n the l e g side.
Fortunately Silva was more accurate and with the help of appalling
umpiring from Salter he picked up an early wicket. Slator also bowled
with amazing accuracy and he took a wicket when Everett moved
sharply behind the wicket to stump the Churchill Captain. Lunch was
taken with Imperial appearing to have Churchill on the rack.
Immediately after lunch Slator bowled a loose ball down the legside,
the batsman connected with a good sweep and Kennedy at short leg,
confused by the FA C u p Final, decided to stop the ball with his head.
Not only was this an expensive drop but also Kennedy had to leave the
field and retire to the nearest hospital for a precautionary X-ray. The
batsmen now took control and it was not until Crowe returned to collect
three more wickets and jug-buying figures of 5-37 that IC were back in
the game. O n e of these wickets was a simple catch to Slator w h o had
made a real mess of an earlier opportunity. Silva and Slator each took
one more wicket to reduce Churchill to 125 for 9. However their hard-
hitting N o 10 and dogged N o 11 survived and added a further thirty
runs. It could have been fewer if Morton had held a chance two inches
off the ground diving six feet to his right (Wonder who is writing this
article - Ed.). He didn't and Churchill declared at 155 for 9.
The IC innings got off to a disastrous start with Simpkin missing a full
toss and White being run out by Clark. Clark made amends by
scoring 63 not out. However, most of his early shots seemed to be
attempts at giving catching practice to the Churchill fielders. They
obviously need more practice as they dropped them all. Morton was
beginning to look dangerous but sacrificed his wicket in the race
against the clock for the runs. After Everett, Slator and Crowe had
caused the scorer (Mrs Ellacott) little bother, Silva and Clark were
instructed to play for the draw. They took this instruction very seriously
and refused to look for any runs. Rumours that the refusal to run was
due to the large bulk of Silva remain unconfirmed. IC finished on 114
for 9.
A good night was had by all in the bar. After a drawn game of cricket
the honour was settled on a boat race where we stuffed them. We also
drank them out of bitter and wrecked the opposition with a rather silly
game.
T E A M : Everett, White, Simpkin, Clark, Morton, Slator, Crowe,
