Prophetic and startling
The Year of the Sex Olympics predicts Reality TV as an opiate of the masses
Believe it or not, I decided to see
The Year Of The Sex Olympics not
because of its title, but on the basis
of the ICA’s description: “terrifying-
ly prescient”. This small summary
proved itself to be highly accurate.
In the opening scenes we see a TV
studio directing a live broadcast of
“Sport Sex”, narrated by a frighten-
ingly gleeful Misch (Vickery Turn-
er), and controlled by Lasar and
Nat (Brian Cox, Tony Vogel). The
first thing which strikes you (aside
from Nat’s maddening eyes) is the
strange dialect of English they
speak.
It is a mélange of embarrassing
1960s American slang spoken in a
British accent (“super king”), and
a degenerate grammar most ASBO
winners could correct. At one point
Misch is heard remarking “you
gone real mad-head”. Well dear, I
certainly have.
From Output (the broadcast
centre), Lasar and Nat watch live
screens of the audience to gauge

Cinemas are full of selfish bastards
As anyone who has been to see a
film recently will have had forced
into their heads by a sneering scots-
man, it’s the experience that counts
when going to the cinema. Not the
quality of film or even of your fellow
cinemagoers, apparently. The ad-
verts which proclaim this entreat
those already in a cinema to go to
the cinema rather than download-
ing pirate recordings, which be-
comes particularly pointless when
the adverts are talking about the
very film you have just paid money
to come and see. It’s very much a
case of preaching to the choir.
These adverts are also fairly non-
sensical in other regards - they de-
scribe the camera-angle of pirates
as dodgy, when generally this angle
is straight-on; they show the audi-
ence applauding, a very rare oc-
curence unless the director is in the
room, and claim that the picture will
be much smaller, which is hardly a
surprise as most cinema screens I
have ever seen would dwarf an en-
tire row of houses and, as yet, the
home cinema market does not have
any screen larger than the homes
themselves. Most galling of all is
the claim that only pirate copies
are spoilt by people in front getting
up and going to the toilet.
Whereas the truth is that the cin-
ema is afflicted by this problem,
and many more. To be quite frank,
cinema etiquette appears not only
to tolerate, but to positively encour-
age inconsiderate behaviour; this
can easily be observed by the dis-
dain with which anyone daring to
complain about anything is treated.
There is a culture of disapproval
of so-called whingers rather than
of the targets of these complaints
which in turn leads to the suffering
of such behaviour in silence.
Even I, a very frequent cinema-
goer and not one to keep my com-
plaints to myself as you can prob-
ably tell, find myself affected by
this stiff upper lip mentality; I am
frequently subjected to a micro-
cosm of human inconsideration in
the form of people chatting away
during the film, rustling packets of
sweets and eating popcorn loudly,
or simply kicking the seats in front
when rearranging their feet every
five minutes or so.
And yet, I am so unwilling to pro-
voke a confrontation by asking peo-
ple to perhaps close their mouths
whilst eating or to kindly stop talk-
ing for fear of being told to fuck off
for my troubles.
But what sort of culture sells food
that comes in rustly packaging or
is, in itself, rustly in a place where
people would be wanting quiet?
Though at least they have some
level of consistency - every possible
sense is bombarded, thanks to evil-
smelling hot dogs to assail the nose,
to be eaten in rooms full of still air,
where people will be sitting still for
hours on end.
Perhaps I’m just bitter from
having Pan’s Labyrinth, an other-
wise excellent film which I would
heartily recommend to those who
don’t object to excessive brutality
onscreen, ruined for me by having
their enjoyment, and intermittently
make calls using phones on their
wrists.
The Coordinator (Leonard Ros-
siter) is the only person in Output
old enough to remember the “old-
days time”, and introduces us to
this strange world in a conversation
with Nat. Society has been split into
two genetic groups, the high-drives
(those we see in Output) and the
low-drives (the audience).
The audience are kept in a perpet-
ual state of apathy by being shown
uncensored programmes such as
“Art Sex” and “Hungry And Angry”.
The modus operandi of this world
is “watching not doing”. Since the
division of society, war (“tensions”)
has been done away with, taking
the associated lexicon with it.
Already this film has the feel of a
Friday night on Channel 4. Later,
in a room where a robot is playing
chess with itself, a strange man
insists that Nat see his mildly dis-
turbing paintings. This man is un-
happy with being a set designer, and
wants people to see his pictures, to
feel “tensions”. Nat suggests he
change to designing the computer-
ised shapes which float about the
screen between programmes.
The central plot of the film takes
shape when the Coordinator an-
nounces to the broadcast team that
The Computer has suggested that
the audience would benefit from
some humorous
programmes.
The team discov-
er just the sort of
programme they
are looking for
when the pained
artist dies in an
accident on set,
causing the au-
dience to erupt
into laughter. The
Live-Life Show is
born.
Nat, his low-
drive child and
her mother are
popcorn thrown over me by a care-
less eejit with who then went on to
change seat three times in twenty
minutes though not before poison-
ing the air next to me with hotdog
fumes, hearing the constant chew-
ing of popcorn from the man behind
me, feeling the seats shake every
time a man along the row behind
decided he wasn’t comfortable
enough and hearing the rustling of a
plastic bag which a mad woman in-
sisted on clutching onto throughout
the film rather than putting it down
somewhere which shook whenever
she chose to read her magazine
rather than watch the film (this was
at roughly ten minute intervals).
This same woman kept talking to
herself (and none too quietly), in-
cluding the rather bizarre utterance
with regard to the advert encourag-
ing people not to pirate Apocalypto,
on learning that it was by Mel Gib-
son; “oh no, he’s not going to be rac-
ist in it, is he?” Well, quite.
And yet, I didn’t say a word to
anyone, instead deciding to be po-
lite and simply glare resentfully at
the perpetrators who were, it has
to be said, blithely oblivious to the
whole thing. I only wish other peo-
ple could be quite so tolerant - at a
different showing I was talking to a
friend during the adverts before the
trailers, and a man shouted at us to
shut the fuck up. An understand-
able sentiment were we doing so
during the film and maybe even, at
a push, during the trailers, but I can
hardly see how the poor gentleman
was having his viewing experience
ruined by the adverts being spoilt.
Perhaps the experience counted
more to him than I had realised.
This new year heralds a brand
new film section here in Felix.
From this week, this page will be
a shrine to the cinematographic
arts of past, present and future:
lovingly composed and presented
with lashings of bile and adoration
in equal measures.
In light of this new approach, we
two explosively exciting features.
First is the competition this week,
offering you the chance to win win
win a Breaking & Entering poster
signed by Jude Law and Anthony
Minghella (see below for details).
Second, we launch a new fea-
ture: the Posthumous Review.
This is a review, worship/hate-
fully composed by anyone who
feels like it, of any film, no matter
how old. Ideally, you (yes, You) has
a film/director/actor that you be-
lieve does not receive the bile/love
that it rightfully deserves, and will
leap at the chance to tell everyone
why it is shit/great. Nothing is sa-
cred. Lambast Casablanca if you
so desire.

N.B. The future is dominated by 60s wallpaper
We have two autographed posters
from the film Breaking & Enter-
ing, signed by Jude Law, Anthony
Minghella and Rafi Gavron, to give
away to you lucky idiots.
All you have to do to win these
delicious wall hangings is to email

ther an entertaining confession
of your crimes, or simply name
the film in which the character
in the top left corner of the page

Go on... shovel it down your fat throats you inconsiderate scum
sent “outside” to live and be filmed
in a cottage on a remote, appar-
ently British, island. The Coordina-
tor provides them with instructions
about the real world; about lighting
fires, animals, and cooking.
What Nat does not realise is that
Lasar has also released a psycho-
pathic killer onto the island to pro-
vide the audience with the ultimate
thrill. They haven’t quite gone that
far on Big Brother or Celebrity
Love Island, thank God.
Throughout the film, there is a
peculiarly English acceptance of
the status quo. The characters
express no genuine hatred of the
underclass, nor make any attempt
to moralise their society. Indeed,
when Nat discovers has a low-drive
daughter, he cares for her, and

seems more concerned for his own
well-being having broken the rules
than angry or disgusted.
I found it truly amazing how well
a forty year-old film could predict
how television has progressed. It
touches on so many themes which
perplex people today: genetic modi-
fication, liberal use of anti-depres-
sants, dependence on technology,
subservience of the masses to TV,
the numbing of the mind to extreme
content and the paradox of reality
TV (which Lasar sums up in his jus-
tification of the psychopath: “it’s a
show, something has to happen”).
Unfortunately the Institute Of
Contemporary Arts are not show-
ing it again, but I recommend you
see this brilliant film if you ever get
the chance.
