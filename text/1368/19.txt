This year’s Fellwanderers Winter
Tour was to Wasdale in the western
Lake District. The most isolated
valley in the Lakes has further su-
perlatives to its fame: it contains
Wastwater, England’s deepest lake
and the valley’s head is surrounded
by some of England’s tallest moun-
tains, including Scafell Pike.
Our base for the five days of
walking was Murt Farm Camping
Barn, situated just outside Nether
Wasdale at the southwestern end
of Wastwater. The reference Bible
for this region is Wainwright’s, The
Western Fells, volume 7 of the Pic-
torial Guide to the Lakeland Fells
(1966). With an area of high pres-
sure providing excellent weather
for the week, we were in for a treat
– yes, whilst London was in fog,
we had blue skies. Our aim for the
week: to scale some of England’s
highest peaks.
Sunday
Our first day’s walk explored our
surroundings, the Screes. Leaving
the barn by 9, we walked through
Latterbarrow forest up onto Ir-
ton Fell (395m). Many tried their
best to jump in the bogs but none
surpassed Thubeena’s efforts (al-
though I came close). Rising up
to Whin Rigg (535m) above the
Screes we were blessed with some
sunshine which had found its way
through the mist, and breathtak-
ing views down to the dark waters
of Wastwater 450m below. Our final
ascent was up to Illgill Head (609m)
where we sat in sunshine for lunch.
The entire rainfall for the week (just
a few spots) fell as we descended
down Straighthead Gill, successful-
ly fording the streams swollen from
the previous week’s washout.
After pausing to observe a rain-
bow rising from the lake, we ambled
to the valley floor, and made a quick
trip to the Wasdale Head Inn for a
nice (brewed on site) pint. It turned
out to be not quick enough as dusk
fell whilst we negotiated the lake-
side path beneath the Screes on the
way home.
Despite the darkness, spirits
were high whilst crossing the boul-
der field before finally reaching the
head of the lake. Back at the barn
we enjoyed our now legendary West
African stew (the one with the pea-
nut butter) and got in the festive
spirit with Christmas pudding and
brandy butter!
Monday
After the usual faff – AKA difficulty
in emerging from nice warm sleep-
ing bags – we set off in the bright
sunshine across the fields of Ash-
ness How to scale Middle Fell
(592m).
The ascent from Greendale was
marvellous with the blue-sky sun-
shine peaking over the Screes con-
quered the previous day. Somehow
it was warm enough for shorts and
t-shirt – crazy! Must be this global
warming thing. After many false
summits, the real one provided that
all important ‘wow-factor’ (supple-
mented with biscuits) with excel-
lent visibility.
Sadly Thubeena had a ligament
injury, so we changed from the
planned route (up onto Seatallan
and down via Buckbarrow); after
descending north to the col, we
clambered over rocks round to
Greendale tarn for lunch.
The weather was having a good
effect on Shweta who, after previ-
ously exclaiming she was “more of
a TV person”, was now becoming
“at one with nature”! It surely was
a beautiful spot for enjoying the
serenity on the fells. We contoured
round above Greendale Gill back
down to the valley.
It was to be the last day for Aan-
chal, Thubeena, Shweta and Dhara-
ni, who were taking a train at 5 from
the coast, so we piled in the minibus
to go and enjoy a fantastic sunset
over the sea at Drigg. Back at the
barn we cooked and demolished an
excellent apple and leek casserole
before heading out under hundreds
of stars and the visible Milky Way to
the local Strands pub.
Given our village seemed to have
all of 10 houses in it, we were some-
what surprised by the provision of
two inns, opposite one another. But
we weren’t complaining!
Tuesday
A pre-7am alarm signalled the start
of a tougher climb; sights were
set on Great Gable (899m), the py-
ramidal mountain framing our val-
ley. According to Wainwright, our
proposed ascent via the ominous-
sounding Little Hell Gate scree
between the Napes was the most
strenuous route.
Treading the Moses’ Trod path
east from Wasdale Head we soon
rose from the valley floor up Gavel
Neese, all the while battling to rise
faster than the swirling mist. But
from 450m the “Jekyll became a
monstrous Hyde” up whose torrent
of stones we “forced our limbs”,
aiming at a cairn “fifty swear-words
higher”.
In reality it wasn’t quite as severe
as Wainwright described, but with
icy patches it did get quite technical.
The scramble up the frozen slopes
brought us above the mist, allowing
us to view the previous walks’ sum-
mits poking above the cloud.
After contouring the base of White
Napestheascentupthescree-shoot
gulley began. We soon found our-
selves past the snow line (~780m)
standing atop the rocky tower of
White Napes, surveying a most ex-
ceptional view up the valley.
We were duly rewarded for our
early morning efforts. Sadly for us
the mist did finally engulf us whilst
scrambling to the snow-covered
summit. Given the icy conditions
we were glad of a simple descent
via the tourist path to Sty Head.
Lunch was taken with a view up to
Seathwaite, the Watendlath Fells
and the Helvellyn ranges beyond.
With Mark’s ankle playing up
a little, we took the gradually de-
scending path over Toad How back
down to Wasdale Head for 2pm. We
couldn’t resist another trip to the
celebrated Wasdale Head Inn. On
the drive home, the red sunset be-
hind the lake deserved a stop.
Wednesday
Wasdale splits at its Head, with
a short northern extension, Mo-
sedale, surrounded by rugged
peaks. The Mosedale horseshoe
– Black Sail Pass, Looking Stead,
Pillar, Scoat Fell, Red Pike, Yew-
barrow – is one of the finest ridge
