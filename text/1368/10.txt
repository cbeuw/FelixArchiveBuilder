The Spring/Summer catwalks in
London were highlighted by bursts
of originality from British design-
ers. Christopher Kane, Gareth
Pugh and Giles Deacon, Central
St. Martins' graduates, were the
source of the most boldly futuristic,
visually arresting designs.
Christopher Kane, having had
Donatella Versace sponsor his
MA collection, is now working as
a freelance designer for Versace.
This show is Kane's first collection
under his own label. Those neon
dresses may have guaranteed him
publicity, as an illustration of the
new "nu-rave" trend which at the
moment exists purely in the pages
of fashion magazines.
However looking past the endless
variations of the same neon skin-
tight 80's dress, there are some
interestingly structured dresses
which play on the theme of volume,
which is a common thread through
many of the catwalk shows. Also
common through the shows is a
monochrome colour theme with
muted greys, contrasting with
bursts of neon brights.
Gareth Pugh didn't disappoint
with another theatrical show un-
dercut with humour. His shows
are more visually inspiring than
they are commercially viable, but
Pugh's sense of space and shape is
stunning.

printed with anchors, hearts, and
bunnies. Available from £50. H&M
do rip-offs for a more realistic
£9.99.
The Prada turban
Can you get more commercial than
turbans? It's like the catwalk has no
artistic credibility at all. Topshop
and Primark will be doing their
high-street knock-offs, so soon tur-
bans will be available for all.
Primp Prada
inspired than his last. Perhaps a
result of the obvious cross-pollina-
tion going on between Deacon and
Pugh. He might want to think about
a shoe collection, instead of using
the same pair of last year's shoes
with studs attached with every sin-
gle outfit.
Preen, a London label which
also designs for Topshop, showed
a modern clean-lined collection,
with a decidedly futuristic spin.
Their original take on basic pieces
contrasts with the horribly early
90's collections of more established
brands, such as Ralph Lauren, also
showing.
London may not be a big event in
the fashion calendar compared to
Paris, Milan or New York, however
it tends to be the most original.
