ICU Debating Society has had a
busy term: so far we’ve entered
competitions at Bristol, Cambridge,
the English-Speaking Union and
most recently Kings. The main aim
of the society is to train people in
the ‘British Parliamentary Style’ of
debating, which simply put means
debates of four teams of two peo-
ple (two teams proposing the mo-
tion, two opposing) with five minute
speeches. Although I attended
Bristol as a judge, the Cambridge
IV on 17-18 November was my first
chance this year to debate. Unsur-
prisingly it was quite a baptism of
fire!
DebateSoc sent two teams and
one judge along to what, along with
Oxford’s IV (intervarsity), is one of
the highlights of the debating cal-
endar. Stepping out from a packed
train into the pouring rain, we had
quite a soggy start to Friday night’s
two rounds in Cambridge’s Union
Society building. This is a grand
edifice originally erected in 1866,
with its own bar, a number of rooms
for smaller debates, and a large de-
bating chamber big enough to ac-
commodate the 88 teams that had
arrived from all over the world.
The format of the competition
was six rounds of motions every-
one took part in, followed by the
‘break’ of highly-scoring teams
into the semi-finals, finishing with
the black-tie final in the chamber.
Unusually for an IV, all the motions
were ‘open’ rather than ‘closed’;
that is to say, they were sufficient-
ly vague so as to let the first team
proposing the motion make it into
a debate on whatever subject they
chose. Normally the motions are
much more clearly defined. This
policy rather changed the dynamic
of the debates, because the other
teams were unable to make much
use of the 15 minutes preparation
one gets beforehand.
Perhaps inevitably therefore,
some of the motions were slightly…
unorthodox. The first debate my
partner Till and I had to tackle, as
second prop, was along the lines of
‘This House Would Freely Sell Via-
gra Over the Pharmacy Counter’.
Amusing as it was though, we man-
aged to come up with some plau-
sible reasons to support the idea,
including the elimination of the in-
ternet black market and enhance-
ment to everyday quality of life.
When we got to propose a motion
we chose ‘THW Introduce a Flat
Tax’, as an issue I was familiar with
from an earlier political debate.
The final was very entertain-
ing. With a large, eager audience
dressed up in black tie the debate
took on a more theatrical character,
with wit and passion demonstrat-
ed in equal measure. There were
two teams from Yale, an Oxford
and an Irish team. The proposing
Yale team, who went on to win the
debate and the competition as a
whole, proposed a motion allowing
the torture of terrorist suspects for
intelligence information. Although
contentious, the opposition teams
failed to engage with the motion
significantly beyond the obvious
moral objections, which was a sur-
prise considering that the pros and
cons of such an idea are relatively
well-worn on the debating circuit.
Although the Irish team didn’t win,
their hoard of chanting support-
ers certainly added to the charged
atmosphere.
Imperial’s two teams faired rela-
tively well considering the strength
of the competitors, coming about
three-quarters of the way down the
table. Special recognition must go
to Till though, who did well on the
individual speaker tab. Debating is
a skill that requires regular prac-
tice against challenging teams to
improve, and as such I’m sure that
all our performances will improve
over this year after a rather barren
summertime.
Aside from the debating though,
the social experience was enjoy-
able. On both nights Imperial got
its fair share of free alcohol, and the
Emmanuel College fresher we were
crashing with generously toured us
around Cambridge, showing us the
key sites of interest, such as Garde-
nia, aka Gardies the kebab shop.
Debating really makes a wonder-
ful break from science. Although
science certainly teaches you to
think analytically, I don’t believe it
prepares you for the challenge of
articulating difficult arguments ver-
bally, which is a very valuable skill
indeed. Why not join DebateSoc,
and broaden out your base a little?
We practice weekly on Wednesdays,
6-8pm in SAF 199, as a prelude to
entering actual competitions.

walks in the entire District and was
our plan for the day.
It is also a long and tough day’s
walk with 1300m ascent over 10.5
miles. After walking up Mosdale
from Wasdale Head, the ascent up
to Black Sail Pass brought us into
mist. We rose through it after Look-
ing Stead (627m) and into astonish-
ing views far and wide. The final
ascent to Pillar (892m) required
treading carefully on ice and snow,
with rewards of 360 degree views in
the sunshine.
We paused lengthily to eat bis-
cuits, ahem, to remark on views to
Skiddaw (13 miles) and to Scotland
(40 miles). The ridge walk contin-
ued down via Wind Gap, then up
to Black Crag (828m). We deviated
from the horseshoe to go and bag
Little Scoat Fell (841m) too; beside
the wall summit cairn we lunched
in the sunshine. Rejoining the ridge
walk down and up onto Red Pike
(821m) gave some dramatic drops
on the eastern craggy side of Red
Pike.
We reached our decision point at
Dore Head col early enough to al-
low one final mountain: Yewbarrow
(628m).Thismountain,althoughnot
substantial in height, offers a tricky
scramble up Stirrup Crag from
Dore Head. The scramble is “noth-
ing more than a strenuous exercise
in elementary gymnastics” accord-
ing to Wainwright. It was a welcome
challenge! We enjoyed more excel-
lent views in the late afternoon sun-
shine from the summit.
We descended via the remarkable
cleft of the Great Door, Christine
faster than Nathaniel and I, notch-
ing up a decent 8/10 whilst using
her posterior as a valuable agent
of friction. We stopped to watch
the sunset over the valley. It was
another breathtaking scene and
we concluded that it was a great
shame Mark had declined the day
on account of his ankle. Still we had
enjoyed the day to the full. Back at
the barn we cooked up a remark-
ably tasty potato curry.
Thursday
No ambition to conquer the higher
fells of the region would be satisfied
without tackling Scafell. We chose
the Pike; initially we liked the idea
of doing both, but with the icy condi-
tions as they were, and the forecast
cloud, it seemed over-ambitious. So
the Pike it was, with Mark joining
us again.
Once more we started from Was-
dale Head village green, head-
ing south around Lingmell’s flank
(Chris losing her hat), then turning
east up Brown Tongue. Once at Hol-
low Stones (~600m) we ascended
into cloud, but the north face tourist
path had been chosen because this
route’s snowed-covered cairns are
frequent enough to be followed in
mist. The route brought us surpris-
ingly swiftly to the wind-swept sum-
mit (978m); it seemed much easier
than yesterday’s ascent. Luckily a
guy turned up at the top in time to
take our photo.
We noted a day of more superla-
tives: on the shortest day of the
year we were tackling the high-
est mountain in the worst weather
we’d had all week! Retracing our
footsteps (literally in Mark’s case)
down to Lingmell col we carried on
up to Lingmell (807m). Our west-
ward descent was punctuated with
excellent falls again from Chris and
Mark, both making notable contri-
butions to the use of the rear ap-
pendage in mountaineering. Once
below 400m the sunshine came out
again; it was quite warm. No final
walk should end without a trip to
the pub – after trying our best to
use up leftover ingredients for din-
ner we retired to the other village
pub, the Screes Inn. We were yet
again astounded by the multiplica-
tive nature of the locals – the pub
was rammed, yet it’s in the middle
of nowhere!
Nathaniel cleverly noted that on
this Christmas tour we covered
“the twelve fells of Christmas”. An-
swers on a postcard. It was a fantas-
tic week’s fellwalking with excellent
company, astonishing weather and
superb fells. Here’s to another year
of fine walking and socialising!
This Christmas tour was the
first Fellwanderers trip for which
CO2 emissions from unavoid-
able transport and electricity have
been carbon offset. Calculated CO2
emissions for the week totalled 0.32
tonnes (292Kg from diesel combus-
tion), which cost £2.42, as offset by
ClimateCare.org. The offset com-
pany was chosen because it ad-
heres to the Gold Standard bench-
mark for ‘high quality’ carbon offset
projects, and will be used to offset
future Fellwanderers’ trips. Do ask
me for further details.
We believe the Fellwanderers has
vested interests in the environment
and its preservation via the mitiga-
tion of climate change, because our
trips run to areas of natural beauty.
Despite the already small impacts
of our trips, I hope such an initia-
tive can pave the way for more RCC
trips, maybe even as union-wide
policy in the future.
The Fellwanderers also organise
weekend trips every fortnight; day
walks in and around London are
also fortnightly.
See www.fellwanderers.com
for details. If you are interested

brough@imperial.ac.uk.
