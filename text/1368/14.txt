I, Gamer
Y
ou wait ages for
Imperial College
to get some games
coverage, and then
everything turns
up at once. It’s 2007, everyone,
and devious plans are afoot in
the basements of the Student
Union.
Hopefully everyone had en-
joyable holidays and spent
plenty of time queuing outside
Virgin for Wii consoles, harass-
ing the managers at various
branches of Game, and gen-
erally trying to find one of the
bastard things that seem to be
everywhere except the stores
you were visiting.
But if you’ve entered the New
Year empty handed, don’t fear -
Felix is arranging a few events
that should spur on some en-
thusiasm for the older games
in your collection, and we start
this week with coverage of a
rather health-endangering
playthrough of Deus Ex.
More importantly, though, is
a new society that’s finding its
feet this year. First Stoic TV
opened Games Watch, then
Felix relaunched a Games Sec-
tion. Now Imperial College has
a Games Society, and this term
will see the first events by the
club including LAN get-togeth-
ers and more.
We’ll be covering the society
in the future, but if you want to
get in touch now, you can con-
tact Nimalen, one of the society
founders, for more information,
or to tell him what you hope to
see – nb604@imperial.ac.uk
We’ve also made a few chang-
es in the section here, shafting
the Out Now column in favour
of a far sexier and informative
news page. And we’ve axed the
cute little quote on the bottom
of the last page, as well as oth-
er plans for the future. Like the
changes? Hate the changes?
Get in touch with us.
Whatever way you look at it,
change is on the cards in 2007.
Huge leaps forward are ap-
proaching, not least in the con-
sole stakes with the European
release of the PS3, but also
with some of the most techno-
logically impressive releases
for the PC in some time.
It’s all to come, and Felix
hopes to be covering it all. Don’t
be deceived by the usual Janu-
ary slump – this year is going
to be huge.
Congratulations to Philip
Clemow, Patrick Willis, Sam
Tournoff and George Khouri
who all bagged prizes in our
Christmas giveaway.

This week in videogames
I
t’s been a busy Christmas pe-
riod for anyone stocking, or
hoping to buy, a Nintendo Wii.
Stories of queueing in the wee
small hours (pun more-or-
less intended) for the consoles and
paying ridiculous prices weren’t re-
stricted to America, as high-street
retailers, unable to confirm their
delivery dates for the revolution-
ary console, faced queues outside
shops long before opening hours,
and non-stop phone querying from
anxious customers. Reports of vari-
ous store employees purchasing
early deliveries and selling them on
at nearly double the price were dis-
appointingly common.
As this Felix goes to press, the lat-
est figures suggest that ten million
360s have been sold since launch,
giving Microsoft a chance to launch
more news on IPTV, the 360’s first
move into multimedia manage-
ment. News has also been leaked
regarding an upgraded version
of the 360, thought to be released
sometime in 2007. The ‘Zephyr’, as
it’s currently known, will run with
less noise and less heat, as well as
boasting HDMI ports and a rather
large 120Gb hard drive.
Sony meanwhile remain confi-
dent of their success. The PlaySta-
tion3 has sold over a million units
worldwide, making it a faster-sell-
ing console than its predecessor
was at this point. Despite setbacks
in distribution, the previous market
leaders are still hoping to have six
million units in place by April.
But despite all of this, it was a
good yuletide for gamers. Nintendo
shifted every single one of their
hundreds of thousands of consoles,
and DS sales soared in line with
this, allowing the handheld giant to
up production to the rate of four per
second. Even with various tales of
injury and TV breaking, and a costly
recall of many Wii controllers, there
are a lot of happy Zelda players out
there, and even happier account-
ants for Nintendo.
So with Microsoft claiming to
have sold half a million 360s over
Christmas alone, and Nintendo’s
success quite plain to see, it might
surprised gamers to know that a re-
cent report suggests that the Play-
Station3 will have a market lead,
with seventy-five million consoles
worldwide, by 2010.
The market analysis group Re-
search and Markets claim that
the last-gen market share, way in
excess of 50%, combined with ru-
mours of a successor to the PSP
,
mean that Sony are likely to end up
dominating for the next few years
at least. Whether you see that as
good news for market balancing,
or bad news for innovation, it does
seem likely that the sheer scale of
PS2 ownership has bought Sony an-
other chance at gaming.
Better news than a massive busi-
ness being given a chance at gam-
ing, however, is the idea that gam-
ers themselves might get a chance.
This week, the Minister for Creative
Industries called for the gaming
Wii problems, tall stories and Wrighty looking odd. Same story, different year?
industry to sponsor an ‘academy’
that would teach and encourage the
next generation of games design-
ers, programmers and artists. Cit-
ing the London Film School as an
example from another media, MP
Shaun Woodward says that there’s
a sense of “catch-up” for the indus-
try, and that it might help push for-
ward talent that would otherwise
be ignored by mainstream schools.
The British press, in a brilliant dis-
play of tact, termed them “schools
for Geeks”. Well, quite.
Releases this week include Wario
Ware for the lucky Wii owners, as
well as Lost Planet for the Xbox 360.
However, if the release schedule for
the next few months looks bleak to
you (and if it does, you’re not alone)
then it’s worth looking around on-
line for the tail end of the January
sale. Trauma Center: Under The
Knife on the DS can be nabbed for
less than £10 at Tesco.com, Splinter
Cell: Double Agent and the Dawn
Of War Anthology are both half
price on Play.com, and Company
Of Heroes (Limited Edition) is £18
purchased online through Game.
Searching around will reveal a lot
of good deals that are likely to go on
until the end of January.
The best money-sapper we’ve
come across this week, though, has
to be the posture-support pillow
release for gamers who use hand-
held consoles. A Japanese com-
pany, Lofty, have designed a pillow
shaped like a big padded vest, that
gamers can hug in front of them to
prevent back pain. Ingenious.
As a contrast, America got the President of Nintendo America at their launch. We got a tit in a golf suit
It looked like a lot at launch, but it wasn’t. Now the race is on for the factories to get consoles on the shelves before consumers lose interest
