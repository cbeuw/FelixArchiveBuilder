A no confidence motion may be submitted against the Deputy President (Graduate Students) next week
Felix has learnt that a no confidence
motion is likely to be submitted
against Shama Rahman, Deputy
President (Graduate Students), al-
leging that the sabb has misled Un-
ion Council, failed to work the hours
required by her contract among
other failings, and that her position
“has become untenable”.
Felix has obtained a leaked copy of
the draft paper, complete with high-
lights, that shows that almost all of
the Union’s Executive Committee
(excluding the sabbs themselves)
have seconded the motion, includ-
ing all of the Faculty Union Presi-
dents, a number of CSCs and other
senior Union officers. The Execu-
tive Committee is the second most
important body in the Union, and is
superseded only by the Council.
The document obtained by this
reporter is 34 pages long, and
contains numerous allegations of
misconduct, incompetence, and
breaches of Union regulations.
The paper was written by Jon Mat-
thews, Deputy President (Finance
& Services).
Should the motion succeed, Ms
Rahman will be suspended on full
pay for one month, then dismissed
with a severance package of anoth-
er month’s pay.
The allegations presented in the
paper are backed up with a sub-
stantial appendix, and total more
than 40 individual points. For exam-
ple, the paper claims Ms Rahman
has only managed to get in at 10am
three times during her term so far,
and occasionally arriving as late as
1.30pm; sabbs are required by con-
tract to keep office hours of 10am
to 4pm. This has been observed by
several sources in the Union and
this reporter. She has also missed
at least one meeting with high-level
College officials, and missed more
than four Management & Planning
Group meetings, which are between
Union staff and the sabbs to discuss
confidential issues and strategy.
More serious are the allegations
made about her failure to handle
the welfare issues of PhD students
that had approached her; these
cases had to be handled by other
sabbs. It also describes her lack of
understanding of the issues facing
the various types of postgraduates,
such as PhD students, taught mas-
tersstudents,andresearchmasters
students. In one case, documented
by emails that were copied to Mr
Matthews by the student in ques-
tion, a query by a student about the
number of hours a week a non-EU
PhD student could legally work re-
mained unanswered for a month
before a staff member raised it with
Mr Matthews.
There are also numerous allega-
tions of lying to or misleading either
her colleagues or Council, backed
up with documentation. Felix has
seen emails, provided by an anony-
mous source, that suggest Ms Rah-
man may have ‘pulled a sickie’ in
order to take Friday off. This email
was sent only ten days after the
President, John Collins, sent Ms
Rahman a written formal warning
concerning her attendance and of-
fice hours, among other things.
Miss Rahman is also accused of
badly handling the budget for the
GSA Christmas Ball, initially say-
ing she had secured more than
£2000 from a senior College figure.
Mr Matthews signed off on the
budget in good faith; however, it
transpired that the staff member
had not promised the money, and
the event was cancelled and hast-
ily rescheduled by the sabbs after
it became clear it would make a
substantial loss even if attendance
exceeded expectation. Ms Rahman,
when questioned, said that she was
obtaining written evidence from
the staff member in question that
shows the money was promised
then rescinded. The organisation of
the “3 Colleges” night is also criti-
cised, accusing her of leaving the
takings in an insecure location for
a week, paying the bands directly
from the takings (forbidden under
Union rules), not keeping adequate
track of the attendance, and selling
tickets on credit without authorisa-
tion (also forbidden under Union
rules).
The paper describes how she
told Council she could not attend
QUARC (an important College
meeting for discussing education
quality issues) on 8 December be-
cause she was too busy rearrang-
ing the venue for the Ball. However,
this reporter has seen an invoice
for payment from the new venue,
which was signed off by a senior
Union staff member on the 6 De-
cember, confirming the new venue.
Ms Rahman says that she was still
confirming other details to do with
the venue change, and that a sec-
ond invoice exists which shows that
she had changed the booking.
She is also accused of misleading
Council over a visit to Clayponds.
She claims she went personally;
however, the paper contains an
email from the warden at Clay-
ponds that describes his dissatis-
faction with a late-notice cancella-
tion by Ms. Rahman, and her choice
of replacement.
There are many other accusa-
tions relating to the points above,
and it is not yet clear how much
will make it to the final report. Ms
Rahman was contacted by Felix to
provide comment: “In my defence,
I had a steep learning curve as I
wasn’t given sufficient training and
under pressured circumstances
given the poor handover. I wanted
to do it right, so followed often mis-
leading or incomplete advice from
the team, especially Jon. I didn’t
receive much in the way of support
and guidance, and didn’t get fore-
warned about some of the pitfalls. I
always had to prise information out
of an unhelpful and dismissive man.
This in addition to my own and my
father’s health problems, which the
President knew about, causing me
lots of stress. I‘m still weighing my
decision as to what to do next.”
It is likely the motion, if submit-
ted, will be referred to the newly in-
augurated Union Court to discuss
the evidence, before being passed
back to Council. Shama Rahman, Deputy President (Graduate Students)
