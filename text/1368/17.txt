The numbers indicate the sum of the dig-
its in the row or column indicated. For
example, the square with 7 and 11 in it
means “the numbers you write in the row
below must add up to 7, and the numbers
in the row across must add up to 11”. You
may use each number only once within a
row of cells (called a ‘run’), like sudoku.
To give you a helping hand, we’ve filled in
two squares as an example. This is a rel-
atively easy kakuro, so it shouldn’t take
you too long. As you get more proficient,
we’ll make the grid bigger.
Hexadoku - the destroyer
G
reetings, puz-
zle chimps! This
week’s puzzles are
designed to de-
stroy your feeble
human mind, and send it scur-
rying back to the womb.
Whilst having a brief trundle
through the pathetic knowl-
edge base you call the Internet,
I stumbled across a heinous
torture known only as hexa-
doku. The rules are the same
as that old favourite, sudoku,
but the grid is huge and the re-
wards great.
Should one of you feeble humans
solve this monstrosity, I will reward
you all with extra puzzles every
week. Should no-one solve it, I shall
restrict your sudoku access to one
every two weeks. They don’t call me
the puzzle monster for nothing.
You can also gain yourself extra
smart points by submitting what
other games you’d like to see here.
Maybe the puzzle monster will
grant your wish, or maybe he’ll
laugh heartily as he reads your
pleas while crunching on his diet
(fresh puppy brains).
