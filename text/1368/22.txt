A cold windy day at Harlington was
the setting for us to make amends
for our defeat at the hands of LSE
two weeks earlier. We were a much
improved side compared to two
weeks before, largely thanks to the
work of our new coach John putting
us through our paces, and increas-
ing the aggression of one Virgin in
particular!
We took an early 5 point lead
through an inevitable break away
try from Captain Sam Pemberton,
however LSE soon levelled the
score with a fantastic team effort
try any coach would be proud of.
The rest of the first half was very
evenly matched but our training
showed through with a Virgin try
for winger Louise and a second for
Sam showing just how much we’ve
improved in such a short space of
time. However LSE were far from
beaten and got another team try
close to the half time whistle to
leave us only 5 points ahead at the
break.
One again our new-found disci-
pline and greatly improved rucking
skills shone through and the second
half very much belonged to the Vir-
gins and in particular to Sam who
got a further break-away try. LSE to
their credit did not give up and held
us to our 22 for a good ten minutes,
but the fate of match was well and
truly sealed when Jess Alcena got
the final score of the game.
Our victory was slightly marred
by an injury to Beccy Harrison, our
full back, in the second half. She

The ACC Bar night was the gathering of many IC clubs in December. db’s was
packed with eager students who were seeking free beer for a fun drunken night
full of excitement, random Christmas tree people, a few footy matches and dance
performances by intoxicated students on the stage. Here are the highlights. Enjoy!

was duly escorted to Charing Cross
A&E by the medics of the team! A
massive GET WELL SOON to you
and see you in the Union next week.
I am also a little concerned at how
many injuries may have occurred
in the Reynolds later that night (as
I can’t remember) in the many at-
tempts to steal from, tackle and get
the medics rugby boys naked!
