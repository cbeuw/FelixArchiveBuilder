Kasabian review, yes, music is dead
Just one review this week due to mince pies filling up reviewers’ inner ears and seeking medical attention
As I sat there, miles away from the
four dots jumping around the stage
at Earl’s Court, immersed by the
spooky lighting effects and almost
masked by the hundreds of jump-
ing, hyperactive fans in the crowd,
I kept asking myself one ques-
tion over and over again: why, in
the name of L.S.F., wasn’t I at the
front?
Probably due to me being slow off
the mark (for once); I got into Kasa-
bian far too late, and one day in the
vast summer break that us fresh-
ers ploughed our way through I
decided to download more than just
the ubiquitous Club Foot. Pretty
decent, I thought, so after search-
ing for gig tickets online I discov-
ered, to my dismay, there were only
seating ones left. Imagining the
mosh pit that would no doubt ensue
when said track was played, I was,
it would be safe to say, fairly pissed
off with myself for being so slow.
Still, I went along to the gig, no
doubt Kasabian’s largest gig to
date, and I was quite impressed, but
couldn’t help feeling so detached,
so removed from it all. I was so far
back it was uncomfortably surreal;
upon trying to stand up and jump up
and down to the thundering opener
Shoot The Runner I realized that
not only was everyone else in the
rear upper tiers (sigh) sitting down,
but if I tried to jump I would no
doubt topple and cascade down the
seating area until I landed, most
likely fatally, in the standing area.
Performing their entire second
album, seemingly all revolving
around colonial-era Britain, and
most of their debut, self-titled al-
bum, the gig moved along well and
there was certainly no let down in
the pace, apart from the acoustic
British Legion, with quite calming
lyrics that even the most frantic
moshers felt the urge to stop crack-
ing their heads open for a second
and wave their arms in-sync with
everyone else.
All the tracks played were far-
more heavy on the bass and drums
than could be heard in the LP ver-
sions, and all the better for it: Kasa-
bian’s musical appeal lies in the
pacy, drummer-driven songs such
as Empire and Cutt Off that you
can just simply jump up and down
to, and with a more pronounced
rhythm section live this encour-
aged, if only for brief periods, peo-
ple in the seating areas to actually
stand up and attempt to dance.
The sounds of Oasis, particu-
larly through the vocals of both
lead guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and
lead vocalist Tom Meighan, shone
through on tracks such as Me Plus
One and Last Trip, but this was by
no means a negative aspect of the
performance: it suits the musical
style of Kasabian perfectly. Unlike
Embrace, who in my opinion are liv-
ing in Coldplay’s shadow, Kasabian,
although sounding very similar to
Oasis, are their own band entirely.
Nevertheless, this was hardly
the perfect gig: a few of the tracks
sounded a bit weak, particularly
the single Empire, which was very
disappointing considering how bril-
liant that track is to sing along and
leap around to: the usually-superb
guitar playing of Pizzorno fell flat
here, sadly. Still, tracks such as The
Doberman, the over-the-top album
closer, more than made up for it
with the trumpeter blasting it out.
Finishing with both Club Foot and
L.S.F., the mosh-pitters went into
overdrive and to be honest I could
not imagine in the slightest how
people would jump up and down
(and into each other) during L.S.F.
– until I came to Earl’s Court, that
is. From where I was seated (sigh)
it looked incredible and I wished
wholeheartedly I was a part of that.
Leaving the gig to the seemingly
infinite chants of the closing song,
I was undecided as to how much I
enjoyed the gig. Reminding myself
that I was desperate to leap from
where I was into the standing area
just to be part of the gig rather than
be unusually detached, I concluded
this must be saying something ex-
tremely positive of Kasabian’s in-
fective musical stylings. To all the
Kasabian wannabies out there, I
think Meighan sums their future
up best during the performance
of The Doberman: “Watch them
disappear.”
