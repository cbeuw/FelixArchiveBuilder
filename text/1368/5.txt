Geeks, war and chronic flatulence
H
appy 2007 everyone. I
hope you all had a re-
laxing/merry/drunk-
en holiday and have
successfully managed
to scrape yourselves out of bed and
back into College. This is going to
be a bit of a non-column as nothing
really happens over the Christmas
period so I’ll just share my thoughts
on a few unrelated topics.
2006 is now behind us but I would
like to give you all a piece of advice
in light of a diabolical night out I had
recently. If someone ever offers to
entertain you in Stirling, politely de-
cline. I had the misfortune of endur-
ing an evening there and I wouldn’t
want any of you to be put through
the same ordeal. Basically, nightlife
in Stirling is just shit. It is one of
these parochial places that is large
enough to have the odd nightclub
but too small to have any meaning-
ful competition between establish-
ments for your custom. You end up
getting overcharged for spending 3
hours standing on a floor covered
with random sticky patches whilst
surrounded by people whose pre-
rogative for a night out is to dance
like no-one’s watching, sing like
no-one’s listening and fart like the
Scottish Executive hasn’t imple-
mented a ban on smoking. In short,
give it a miss.
On that note it is nice to be back
at Imperial but every good thing
comes with a downside, sort of
like 21st birthdays for boys. Ini-
tially they are pleased that they are
“coming of age” but at the same
time disappointed that their willies
aren’t going to get any bigger. My
complaint is related to a topic that
has become cliché but what is with
some of the students here? Not that
I am wanting Felix to start another
“hate campaign” in the fashion of
last year’s editor but the argument
needs to be re-stated, if only for the
benefit of the freshers. It is not the
majority who are unnecessarily
geeky but there really is a hardcore
who seem to be hell bent on de-
stroying what is left of Imperial’s
social reputation by devoting large
sections of their free time to online
gaming. I overheard a conversation
the other day (between two indi-
viduals who were clearly whipped
up into some pre-orgasmic frenzy
over the release of….. wait for it….
AN EXPANSION PACK FOR AN
ONLINE COMPUTER GAME!
(You know the type of person I am
referring to, greasy hair, strange
body odour and the woeful dress
sense that suggests their idea of a
sex life is an empty Pringles tube
that has been filled with pigs liver
and given 5 minutes on full power.)
I mean come on guys, a computer
game? Getting excited over one is
all very well and good, if you are 13.
Break free from your self-imposed
electronic shackles and do some-
thing a bit less anti-social. Im not
having a go at all computer games,
some are quite good fun for about
an hour or so but I really don’t see
how some people can spend days
and weeks living live in a “virtual
world” and only talking to faceless
“online friends.” Having experi-
mented with internet games my
philosophy on the subject is as fol-
lows. I see online gaming as being
sort of an electronic equivalent to
the Special Olympics as even if you
win you are still “Special.” If you are
unable to stop totally, at least make
an attempt to ration yourself.
Moving on, unlike columnists
in the “proper” newspapers I’ve
owned up to the fact that I don’t re-
ally have that much to say at the
minute. But what would a new years
column be without some predic-
tions for 2007. Predicting the future
is a mugs game. If I get it right, I’ll
be a smug “I told you so” arsehole
and if I get things wrong I’ll look
stupid so I’ll try and just stick to the
more unlikely thoughts I have had
for the year ahead. Here goes.
World Peace!
Following mass protests outside
parliament by all the major church-
es at the extension of homosexual
rights, a new solution will be pro-
posed to solve sectarian conflicts
from Belfast to Baghdad. It was
touching seeing how distaste for
the gays has the power to unite
hardline Protestants, Catholics,
Muslims and Jews who would oth-
erwise be irreconcilable so lets just
re-route some Gay Pride marches
through the worlds sectarian trou-

blespots. Withdraw the soldiers and
send in the gays. Problem solved.
Revolution!
Closer to home, a victory for the
extreme left sees Student Respect
candidates sweep the board in the
ICU sabbatical elections. Students
return in October to find that Mo-
nopoly has been banned on cam-
pus on the grounds that the game
is part of a capitalist conspiracy
to brainwash young people. Also,
those attending freshers fayre will
find themselves conscripted into
the newly formed ICU Revolution-
ary Guard as our Union is now at
war with the state of Texas.
New Rector announced!
Jeremy Clarkson is appointed as
the new Rector. College grinds to a
halt as Greenpeace mount a sit in
protest in the faculty building.
Big Brother Shock!
Saddam’s execution has turned
out to be pure fabrication. He is
currently being held at a secret
location by Channel 4 and will sud-
denly appear in the Celebrity Big
Brother house within the next few
weeks. This will in turn provoke
international outrage from human
rights organisations. They will pro-
test that no human being deserves
to be imprisoned in an enclosed
space with Jade Goody and family,
however evil their crimes.
Anyway, that’s me finished now.
And I was worried I wouldn’t be
able to fill half a page with whatever
crap came into my head.
An irreverent take on the past, present and future from our estwhile and outspoken Comment Editor
A delightful letter to the Editor
There are
good bands
at Imperial,
apparently
Dear Sir,
I am writing to proverbially take
off my glove and slap James Mil-
len around the face and state that I
demand satisfaction in response to
his comments about the Jazz and
Rock Society in fem last week. In
his article he says “Future Corps-
es, Imperial’s only decent band
(you heard me Jazz&Rock, what
ya gonna do about it eh?).”. In re-
action to the first part, I think that
Future Corpses are great, they are
hauntingly original and great to
watch live, if only because of the
sex faces that Matty makes whilst
playing the drums, but there are
plenty of decent bands at Impe-
rial. Take White Elephant, they
play some damn fine Blues-Rock
covers, 40 Acres,Telemark, Freddy
Freeloader, Reality Cheques, Luca
Laraia, alumni What The Funk,
EmberDaze, Cielo Azul and Carlos
“The One Man Band” Keery-Fisher
(although I had better not mention
Imperial’s longest running, and of-
ficially most dangerous band Don-
keyBox because I am an ex-mem-
ber). And for completeness I think
a certain ‘royal’ band could be men-
tioned... I think the ‘what makes a
great band’ argument has too many
opinionated facets to be deemed an
argument, if a band puts on a good
show then that is good enough for
me, it doesn’t matter what style of
music they are. There seems to be
an epidemic in the number of ob-
noxious alternative music snobs,
who feel that unless the band is
so unbelievably unheard of then it
is nothing but aural diarrhoea. My
personal opinion is that this is a
very pretentious view, particularly
because indy is really the current
‘pop’, and a lot of indy bands sound
like they really want to play rock,
but they also want to please their
indy-loving chums, and so buy tel-
ecasters and rarely take their amps
above 3, let alone 11. I do like The
Killers though.
The Jazz and Rock society is for
lovers and purveyors of live mu-
sic, whatever the genre. We have
a practise room, which may I add
is frequented by Future Corpses,
and we host gig and jam night that
Future Corpses have played at, so
wouldn’t that make them a Jazz and
Rock band? Admittedly we aren’t as
alternative as AMS, a lot of the time
the only two song’s played at jam
nights are Master of Puppets and
Hey Joe, but we like, we may be
making tits of ourselves on-stage,
but it’s all in the name of fun.
As for what are Jazz and Rock go-
ing to do, well James Millen, I chal-
lenge you to a Rock-Off.
Aaron Oliver-Taylor
Jazz & Rock Chairman
Andy Sykes replies,
Aaron, my dear friend, I am in said
band (Future Corpses). How do
you expect me to reply?
I’m a little offended at your rath-
er blasé dismissal of telecasters.
Eat your words, sir, for they’ve
proven to be a far more worthwhile
guitar than the iconic stratocaster
(just have a look at the varieties of
tele available). Incidentally, I play
a tele, you insensitive clod.
However, I’m going to be a lit-
tle serious, and say that it’s a bit
disappointing that out of all the
11,000 or so students we have here,
we have very few bands, and even
fewer decent ones. Covers are fine
and dandy, and fun to play, but it’s
all a little worthless. Surely you’d
much rather go and see a band
play their own, original, new stuff
than simply covering a Led Zep
song (as I’ve unfortunately wit-
nessed far too many times in my
many years in Jazz & Rock).
It’s not about snobbery; it’s about
being creative and so and so forth.
In fact, the snobs tend to make the
worst music and worst bands. Most
of the great bands I’ve met have
been very open-minded, friendly
folk - it’s an attitude thing.
We are, of course, very grateful
for the use of the practice room.
That’s why it’s so shocking there
are so few good bands, when you
can practice in a decent room with
a decent (if horribly bashed up)
drum kit for what amounts to a
pittance.
Good luck finding anywhere else
in London to practice at that price;
I know, I’ve tried.
I’m not sure why you’re challeng-
ing Mr Millen to, as you put it, a
“rock-off”. Surely you should chal-
lenge us?
Want to get something
off your chest?
