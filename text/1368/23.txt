Off the beautiful South Beach, Mi-
ami, the Mumm 30 World Champi-
onships was held from 29 November
to 2 December. The four-day event
is one of sailing’s premier yacht
racing events, with over 30 teams
competing for the coveted World
Champions Trophy. I was there to
represent Queen and Country and
luckily for you I’m here to take you
through the highs and lows of the
week.
10 races were scheduled to be
sailed, and every race counted.
This meant one bad race could cost
you the event, and laid the path for
a high scoring event. Consistence
is key to success here. I was sail-
ing with a British/Irish team called
‘Mammy’; we were quite a new
team to the class, getting together
just a few weeks prior to Miami. On-
board was Volvo Ocean Race win-
ner and 18” Skiff World Champion
Rob Greenhalgh, so there was no
lack of talent in the team. However,
it’s time in the boat that counts and
the Mumm’s have a great interna-
tional circuit including the Tour de
France à la Voile. So we were enter-
ing as definite underdogs.
The team got off to a good start on
the first day, a fresh breeze and big
waves suited us, as we rapped up
the first day with an eight and two
first places to be leading the event
overall. However, it was early days
with seven races left to count.
On the second day the mistakes
came big and fast; after a great start
in the first race we illegally hit the
windward mark – a truly schoolboy
error. We struggled to recover and
got sucked into the pack, finishing
sixteenth. It didn’t get any better in
the second and third races of the
day, two bad starts and a port and
starboard incident meant we fin-
ished with a nineteenth and twenty-
fourth respectively, to end the day
in tenth place overall. A big rethink
was needed that night; racking up
60 points in one day was no way to
win a world championship. 40 points
no worse than five places behind
them in the final race. The final
race was to be sailed in the lightest
and flattest conditions we’d seen
all week. A good start and (finally)
great downwind boat speed meant
we finished on a high, with a fourth,
giving us eighth place overall. A
good result from a team with so lit-
tle practice, but frustrating as we
behind the leaders meant our aims
had changed dramatically, finishing
inside the top 10 was the goal now.
The third day was better, a fifth
and sixth in the first two races was
the boost we needed. However, a
twenty-fifth place in the third race,
our worst result of the competition,
showed there were still some prob-
lems. This left us in eighth place
overall with one race left to sail.
Climbing any further up the leader
board was going to be very difficult.
Keeping hold of eighth was the
only thing left, as we had four other
teams knocking on the door just a
few points behind us; the European
champions (an all-British team),
two Italian teams and an Australian
team. We had to ensure we finished
showed real glimpses of promise.
The 2006 TFV winners won
the event, a French team called
‘Twins’, completing a fantastic year
for them. Second were last year’s
Mumm 30 world champions, an
Australian team called ‘Foreign Af-
fair’. Finishing off the top 5 were the
American, Dutch, and Italian teams
respectively.
