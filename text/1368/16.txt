had also inadvertently caused the
deaths of several government sol-
diers when he decided to test the
friendly-fire settings on his proxim-
ity mines. And it was about to earn
him a few rockets to the chest, un-
less I acted fast.
There are good points and bad
points to playing a game non-stop
from start to finish. Firstly – you
appreciate the design as a whole a
lot more. This may sound odd – af-
ter all, I barely did any sidequests
and certainly didn’t pause for the
scenery. But you see the shape
of the game. You see what it does
well, what it does too much, you see
much more of what the game really
is.
You also begin to drop out of char-
acter slightly. Whilst I remember
fondly my chisel-jawed, no-kills run
through Deus Ex, any delusions of
being the strong, moody saviour
were thrown out of the window this
time as I ran, screaming, through
the Parisian catacombs after be-
ing caught unawares by a Greasel.
It was dark, I was tired. It had to
happen.
S
o, it was one a.m. and I’d
clearly made a cocky mis-
take, as inebriated federal
agents are prone to do.
Quickloading is a familiar
action to the Endurance gamer, but
now was not the time. I took a deep
breath as my foe scanned me for
threats, and made my decision.
I pegged it.
Things were beginning to blur
– guards and soldiers were reduced
to moving obstacles, and it all be-
came a bit like an extravagantly-
textured game of Pong. With all of
my upgrades, gleaned through, ooh,
minutes of lockpicking and stealth,
I was able to run, leap and dodge at
an utterly inhuman speed.
There’s something ridiculously
rewarding about the whole affair.
Sleep deprivation occasionally
gives you bursts of strange, painful
happiness anyway, but deciding to
indulge in the gamer stereotype, to
play a game for so long that it hurts
a little – it feels like a nerdy episode
of Jackass, but with occasional gig-
gling and caffeine overdosing.
Two hours (and a bit) later, and
No-one could blame Gunther for becoming a merciless killing machine of international conspirators. He really didn’t want Lemon-Lime
it was all wrapped up. Only a few
had joined in (see “Things To Do
In NYC When You’re Augmented”,
below for notes on one adventure)
but it had been a rewarding seven
hours – or twelve, if you were one of
the very dedicated.
It’s something they want to do
again – albeit with a different game
– and I can’t blame them. It’s an en-
tirely different way to experience
a game like that. It doesn’t suit all
games or gamers, but Deus Ex fits
the bill of all-night gaming perfect-
ly. Area 51 will never be the same
again.
The story doesn’t quite end there,
of course. The Endurance Gamers
are off on another all-nighter this
January, with Hitman: Blood Mon-
ey as their next target.
Starting in the evening of Janu-
ary 20th, they’ll be playing through
all of the assassinate-em-up in the
style of various movie assassins
Things to do in NYC when you’re augmented
Jim was his name, at least online
anyways. Deus Ex on regular was a
game for sissies. Playing it through
in eight hours was the kind of thing
he was doing when we were all
learning to understand how to move
in Pong. For Jim, Endurance meant
nothing unless it was the real deal.
And so he started four hours be-
fore us, on Realistic difficulty, and
played for twelve hours.
That’s longer than I spend awake
on most weekend days. Below are
some choice excerpts from his
notes. To read the whole story, point

Okay, this is it - all my tracks have
been chucked into WMP and the
shuffle button has been pressed.
HERE GOES NOTHING.
4:30 - Realistic difficulty, yes. Rifle
Training, Computers, Lockpicking,
and Electronics, with an eye on
medicine and GEPs. Albinoism, of
course.
6:40 - To Hong Kong!
6:41 - WTF!? This isn’t Hong Kong!
Paul is sick. I give Renton a gun fo’
killin’ and steal his money. Simons
no like me. :( Flee! Jump! Flee! To
save Paul!
But I get brought down in the
subway.
8:12 - Saves - 58. Music - My
Generation.
DRAGON’S TOOTH WOO! Jump
on a dog’s head, and go see Max
Chen.
9:59 - Heading down in the super-
freighter. I disable, poke and laugh
at a spider-bot, and then go and dis-
able some detectors.
10:23 - Cemetery. Gatekeeper, eh?
STAB.
10:26 - Paris. AAAH! Greasels! And
the sewers. AAAH! Icarus! Terror-
ists have got to stop using bins to
hide secret doors.
11:16 - TONG NEVER SHUTS UP
.
12:15 - Everett. I augment my vi-
sion. Now my augmented vision is
augmented. To Vandenburg! STAB
MECHANIC. ZOMG A BOMB.
12:26 - Vandenburg. Tired now.
LAMs solve anything. Well,
those two missed and exploded a
scientist.
1:06 - Plague > Tiffany, to be hon-
est. One of my more entertaining
deaths involves vaulting a bannis-
ter and landing on an exploding
barrel.
1:46 - HIT GREASELS WITH
BLUNT INSTRUMENT.
2:27 - No bullets. Must. Kill. Page.
2:53 - Jock lives! Hehe. ‘Penetrate
bunker’.
3:05 - Music - Joy Division. Q: How
many pistol bullets does it take to
kill a spider bot? A: 53.
4:00 - HELIOS ABSORB ME I AM
AWESOME.
Shine On You Crazy Diamond plays
over the credits.
DAMN TIRED.
Daaaay Deus-Ex-Oh!
Iiiit is a gaaaame!
Jaaaaay-JC Denton!
Thaaaat is the name!
Of your character!
He has augmentations,
Most of the early game is in sub-
way stations!
Daaaay Deus-Ex-Oh!
Iiiit’s rather good!
Non-linear-oh!
And it goes on. But bless him, after
twelve hours, no-one would dare
stop him. Shine On You Crazy Dia-
mond, indeed.
and serial killers. Jolly, eh?
If you’d like to join them, it’s sim-
ply a matter of taking part on the
night and emailing in your experi-
ences to games.felix@imperial.
ac.uk – we’ll be looking to put some
of the best stories and screenshots
in another article.
If you want to ask questions, or
want more information on how the
night will work, you can also use
that address.
There’s also some more multi-
playerdelightscomingup,including
an all-night Civilisation IV match. If
you’d like to take part, or want to
suggest a game to be played, get in
touch at the same address too.
Felix Games probably doesn’t en-
dorse extended gaming sessions,
and suggest you take regular fif-
teen minute breaks. We would’ve
checked to see, but we were too
busy playing extended gaming
sessions without fifteen minute
breaks.
