Welcome back, everyone. This
week’s crossword was done at very
short notice, so I was unable to
make it a bit less difficult to ease
you back into it after an extended
break. I do apologise.
I hear that Mister Rawden, set-
ter of every other crossword last
term, has stepped down, which
is a shame. In homage, I shall be
putting in a few more anagrams
than I usually would from now on,
much as it pains me to do so.
Also, last issue’s 16 down was
supposed to be ‘Humourist aban-
dons boy to have a hangover (8)’,
but many of you seemed to work it
out anyway. I’m impressed.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
What sucks about
New Year’s Resolu-
tions is that EVE-
RYBODY INSISTS
ON TELLING YOU
THEIRS THEN
BEMOANING HOW THEY’RE
NOT MEETING THEM. NO-
ONE CARES, YOU IRRITATING
DONKEY-RAPER.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
La la la la. I fucking
hate this job. Why do
I continue to do it? I
have no idea. Perhaps
it’s the paycheck;
hmm, no. Perhaps it’s
the company; hell no. No, I think
the reason is the vast amounts of
hookers and blow that I’m constitu-
tionally required to have.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Zingalingling. Dingle-
dong. Veiny love tree.
Pink trombone. Pork
sword. Downstairs
mix-up. Sausage roll.
Trouser snake. Jerk-
stick. My little champ. Jimmy the
wizz. Pink pistol. Happy chappy.
Ol’ squirty. Handcream dispenser.
What is this? Answers on a penis.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
ZOMG! We’re back
again... Yeahhhhhh-
eah! Brothers, sisters,
everybody sing! Gon-
na bring the flavor,
show you how! Gotta
question for you better answer
now! Am I original? Yeahhh-eah!
Am I the only one? Yeahhh-eah!

This Week’s Awful Jokes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
I think hell is like be-
ing constantly raped
by dogs. There’s
grunting, a weird
smell, a distinct burn-
ing sensation, and the
inevitable feeling of dehumanisa-
tion mixed with a perverse excite-
ment at the situation. Perhaps it’s
just me.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Fudge is actually the
greatest word in exist-
ence. It can mean so
many things, while
being a lot of fun to
say; more fun than
even such stalwarts as “dubious”,
“hyperbole”, “genital warts”, and
“help help my cock is stuck in the
Magi-Mix”.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Embarrassment alert!
I was eating a chocka
sandwich which
spilled out all over
me just as this chica
asked for my help! To
make matters worse, Rib ‘n’ Saucy
Nik Naks made my breath smell as
attractive as a munged corpse and
then I got satsuma juice in her eye!
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Look, I’m stuck in
here writing these
things rather than
going on a date. Okay?
I’m actually a wonder-
fully happy human
being, should you ever meet me.
It’s just that when I get sexually
excited, I can’t stop doing stabby-
stabby on passers-by.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
I’d just like to use this
space to say fuck you.
You know who you
are, and I really can’t
stand you. I hope you
get mauled by a rabid
squirrel with a priapism (see previ-
ous) and then get SARS. Or rabies.
Or maybe they combine to form a
super disease, sarbies. Hahaha.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Priapism. Hahaha. Go
type it into google.
Other things I have
learnt from the Inter-
net: no-one has any
pubic hair, the world
is divided into liberals and real
people, World of Warcraft is made
of pure crack, and you can get high
from banana skins. Thanks.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
My staff inform me
there is now such a
thing as Pornotube,
a porn companion to
Youtube. Presumably,
it contains thousands
of videos of cute kittens, car acci-
dents and videoblogs, differing only
in the fact that in the background
there are people masturbating.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
Do write in and tell
us what you think,
because the thing we
look forwards to the
most, down in the
horoscope dungeon,
is reading the fetid scribblings
of sexually frustrated borderline
autistic chumps with all the charm
and grace of a thrown half-brick.
