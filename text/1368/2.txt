Sport partnership looking shaky
Sabbs concerned that the new sports partnership will lead to a “takeover” of sports clubs by the College
At a meeting of the Union Executive
this week, Eric Lai (Deputy Presi-
dent for Clubs & Societies) cast
doubt on the sports partnership
between the College’s “Sport Impe-
rial” department and the Union.
Sport Imperial is responsible for
all of the College’s sports facilities,
including Ethos and the training
grounds at Harlington. The Union is
responsible for running the sports
clubs, through the Athletic Clubs
Committee (ACC). The partner-
ship is ostensibly to be responsible
for directing “sports strategy”, the
argument being that sabbs are only
in place for a year and get bogged
down in operational matters, and
therefore aren’t able to think long-
term about sport at the College; the
partnership, featuring high-level
College staff, should provide some
continuity. The proposal for the
partnership was floated last year,
but was rejected as it was felt by
many to be an attempt by the Col-
lege to take over the sports teams.
This year, however, the partner-
ship was approved, with enthusi-
astic backing from Mr Lai (DPCS),
and a member of staff was employed
jointly by the Union and College to
oversee it. At the meeting, however,
Mr Lai spoke frankly about con-
cerns he had about Sport Imperial
attempting to take over events that
had previously been under the Un-
ion’s remit.
Mr Lai gave a couple of examples.
The annual ACC dinner, where
awards are given to the sports
teams, has drawn the attention of
Sport Imperial, who are looking to
make it a “Sports Partnership” din-
ner. As a result, they plan to charge
£50 a ticket, and it currently stands
to run during the exam period,
and very close to the Summer Ball
(which has a similar ticket price).
As such, Mr Lai said, there were
concerns over how many students
would attend. He also complained
that the ACC Chair, Luke Taylor,
had “offered it [the dinner] on a
plate” to the College.
Secondly, a Sports Festival that
was being organised by a student
as a “Centenary Event” (to raise
money for the Beit Masterplan or
the Student Opportunities Fund) is
now being run by Sport Imperial.
According to the College, this event
will now not make a profit, and
therefore no money will end up in
the Union’s coffers; this is despite
the fact that event would charge
£50 a team, with teams drawn from
four sports, participation from over
ten universities, and the possibility
of corporate sponsorship. Felix’s
magical calculator reckons this
to be “a heck of a lot of money”,
without even considering the huge
amount of money to made from the
bar (given the relationship between
sports teams and alcohol).
Mr Taylor refuted a number of
these points on Live!, calling Mr
Lai “an example of a particularly
deceitful breed of small minded
politician I have always feared he
may be.” He says that the tickets
for the ACC dinner (rebranded as
the Sports Parternship dinner) will
cost £40, and that Sport Imperial’s
involvement will consist only of a
table of their representatives. He
also said that the statement about
the Sports Festival making no profit
were “back of the envelope calcula-
tions” and that the department had
assured him any profits would get
back to the Student Opportunity
Fund. How true this is remains to be
seen, as a source within the Union
has referred to Sport Imperial as
“almost Machiavellian at times.”
Mr Lai has previously been
strongly in favour of the partner-
ship, but appears that recent
events have made him reconsider
his position.
So far, Sport Imperial have pro-
vided clubs with sports kit (total-
ling £45,000 worth) and instructors
(nearly £30,000).
However, many clubs found the
kit unsatisfactory, with no consulta-
tion of clubs prior to the kit being
made. Members of ACC Rugby club with their strips, clearly featuring the Sport Imperial logo

“However looking past the endless
variations of the same neon skin-
tight 80's dress, there are some
interestingly structured dresses
which play on the theme of volume,
which is a common thread through
many of the catwalk shows. Also
common through the shows is a
monochrome colour theme with
muted greys, contrasting with
bursts of neon brights.”

“I am frequently subjected to a mi-

in the form of people chatting away
during the film, rustling packets of
sweets and eating popcorn loudly,
or simply kicking the seats in front

“Hopefully everyone had enjoy-

“The final was incredibly entertain-

large, eager audience dressed up
in black tie the debate took on a
more theatrical character, with wit
and passion demonstrated in equal
measure. There were two teams
from Yale, an Oxford and an Irish
team.”
