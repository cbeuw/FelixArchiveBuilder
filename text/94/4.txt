FELIX
GO EAST YOUNG MAN
in a few months tine about one third of the
population of thin college w i l l , voluntarily or
involuntarily, exchange academic surroundings for
something more industrial. And although many of
us leave vowing to give up our subject in favour
of advertising, administration or-something guar-
anteed to make money, those who actually achieve
this breakaway are quite few.
Since the atmosphere of this college i s far
fr3" cloistered, the great world outside i s no
shoc'c to the ex-I.C. technologist - or even to
the scientist though he may tend to be a more shy,
r e t i r i n g creature. You w i l l exchange your digs
in London for digs or a flat i n some other town
or country r.ore or less exotic, (jixtreae cases
never get away from S.W.7Â»nd spend their time
coning to hops and pretending that they havent
l e f t at all.) You'll find your working colleagues
much the sans as the people here. They may even be
the sane people, as wherever you g.o, you'll find
soie one fro? I.C, already there. Your manager
w i l l appear brighter than.your late research sup-
ervisor, and your equipment w i l l , with any luck,
be shinier than the antiquated apparatus owned by
many of the departments here. Your assistant,
studying for his H.N.C. in the evenings, may make
you feel you did things the easy way; the types
in the workshop w i l l inevitably talk about the
'telly' a l l day long; the cante :n w i l l be no better
than Mooney's Caff. How w i l l you know you've left?
The difference i s , of course, the salary
cheque at the end of the month. *t f i r s t , i t ' s
pleasant to feel more affluent than before and
there seem to be no strings attached, But as tha
months go by, a change of heart occurs in the work-
ing ex-student. He realises that by virtue of fhfcs
s l i p of paper he has become an ordinary menber of the
community, he realises that his years at college,
however enjoyable, were years of waiting and un-
certainty. Ke realises that now the broad outline
of his l i f e i s settled and that must put down
his roots and begin to l i v e along ths lines laid
down, rteactions to this vary as tluch as human
personalities; but at the risk of seeming pompous
one can say that at this; point, irresponsible youth
is over.
EXPLORATION PROJECT:
'H-crwuif, (Summer, 1956
jjave Bridgeivater's expedition to Norway, one
of the f i r s t ventures sponsored by the I.C. Bxplor-
atlon board, show3 promise of being a successful
one from every point of view. I t w i l l leave London
on June 25th, for a small icecap, known as the
Altotbreon, situated i n rocky mountainous country
about 100 miles North of Bergen. The published
object? of the expedition are: f i r s t l y , to study
the geology of the area, and secondly to investig-
ate the actual glacier, this last work being done
by the two glaciologists - jjd. Langham and John
Hallat, who are normally to be found i n the Huxley
Building doing curious things with small clouds,
which they photograph, and crystals of ice, which
are inspected through polaroids. The other members
of the expedition are: Dave Bridgewater himself,
Uraham hees, Bob Tate, and i e t e r Kassler, a l l geol-
ogists from K.C.S. , Brian Lavers from Mines, and
Jim Aitcheson of Guilds.
Those who can visualise the combination of *
geologists, a Miner, and engineer and two g l a c i o l -
0, l ts - not normally a dry occupation i n itself",
w i l l find i t d i f f i c u l t / t o imagine how they w i l l
survive for two months on an icecap which 1" some
distance from the nearest supply of hard 1.-^uor.
They might be even more perplexed were they to see
the diet Dave has prepared for the party, fa are
assured that those who have belts w i l l have to
tighten them - the only/consolation being that
this w i l l h i t the leader as hard as any of us.
The expedition includes a number of enthus-
i a s t i c photographers, and a cine camera i s being
taken, to provide a permanent record of our v i s i t .
Humour has i t that some of us may even appear on
1. T.A.; i f a sound track is made, i t i s hoped, that
this can be cleaned up before any public showings
of the film. - Some of us are hoping to carry out
some subsidiary studies: i t was unfortunately found
impossible to include any biologists In the party,
but many of us w i l l be investigating the behaviour
of the tamed giant horsefly of these'regions - when
gorged with human blood. One of us who has exten-
sive agricultural interests intends to make a sur-
vey of the technique of Norwegian milkmaids, which,
we are told, i s far i n advance of that of their
English counterparts.
Three of those who w i l l be going are members
of the I.C. Mountaineering Club, and w i l l undoubt-
edly make attempts on a number of h-..herto unconq-
uered rock faces - they have also been perfecting
the technique of Irussic slinging as a means of
abstracting glaciologists from crevasses i n glac-
iers - the method may be a l i t t l e slow, and even
inconvenient, but i s very effective - especially
when supplemented by a quart of the best at the
top of the crevasse.
We return from Altotbreen on August the 21st.
- and having drunk Bergen dry, we depart for Newcast-
le on the good ship S.S. Venus - which, we under-
stand, provides as diverting and pleasant Journey
as any that s a i l s on the high seas.
In conclusion i t i s only f a i r to say that I.C.
Exploration Board has provided a tremendous amount
of assistance to the expedition - both financial
and moral, without which i t could never have been
possible in i t s present form.
