AT 9.45 a.m. on a clear Saturday morning the unsuspecting
population of Europe's largest city found themselves suddenly
overwhelmed by a force of mutant apes apparently created some-
where in the vastness of the country's leading Mining College.
This herd was first seen shambling its way down Exhibition
Road. They pounced on large numbers of the public going
unsuspectingly about their daily business, thrusting a red plastic
can forwards with their fearsome battle cry of 'Leukemia Research
Fund'. These fortunate (?)
victims were allowed to freely
part with their shekels, in a
manner which has been des-
cribed as being in the true
tradition of the Dane-Geld and
Al Capone.
Yes folks, this was an
R.S.M. rag stent using ten hired
ape suits.
Your FELIX Reporter was
right there with his own col-
lection can (though not disguised
as an ape) observing the
instantaneous honor, amusement
and havoc created by this
pseudo-anthropoid parade.
Progress was rapid along
Brompton Road to Harrods with
vigorous collecting all the way.
Surprisingly perhaps there were
fewer contributors outside
Harrods than elsewhere (maybe
they were saving their money
for inside). Just along from
there, two certain apes (one
tall, one short) were seen
trying to crack the combination
of a night safe — difficult when
its fitted with a key-lock. But
it doesn't really matter, the
essence of good collecting is
to do something to get yourself
noticed. If what you do is funny
or odd or silly, even better; it
puts people in a happy, generous
frame of mind. A certain amount
of persistence is also required.
One great advantage of the ape-
suits was that it allowed the
collectors to get away with
things that would be impossible
if ordinarily dressed.
The apes went towards the
Kings Road: chasing girls into
shops — then taking a collection
inside; attempting to climb
lamp-posts; putting arms round
girls, and men (ducky), until
they donated. People in fur
coats being easiest to win over-
stroke and 7 knew him when he
was alive'.
One ape had a banana donated
to him, several joined bus
queues temporarily. One woman
called it disgraceful that grown
men (compliment) should run
around dressed up to get money.
A policeman checked collecting
licences after a complaint from
a rival conventional standing
still charity.
Good fun was had by all.
Eventually everyone returned
to college by separate routes,
with 14 near full collection
cans. Yet another successful
rag stunt produced by Mines.
