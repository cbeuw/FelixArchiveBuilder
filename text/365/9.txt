PiG
AFFAIRS
CORNER
Tom Abraham
THIS CORNER, if any of you have not yet realised it, is the
official mouthpiece of the Postgraduates at Imperial College.
Imperial College PG group (ICPGG) has decided to concentrate
on academic affairs in the coming session. I shall, therefore,
detail the main topics to be discussed, in this article, and during
the next few weeks or so, there will be various articles by other
Postgraduate students on these and other issues.
The main topics of interest are:
1. Status of Postgraduates.
Postgraduates form a hybrid
group between the main student
body and the staff. At the
moment students either support
themselves or get a grant from
one of the Research Councils.
While the first year of a Phd
course can be described as a
'training period', the last two
years tend to be more of a
'working period'. In this
respect the charge that we are
effectively cheap research
labour is definitely valid after
the first year. Hence, a change
in status from being students
in our first year, to being paid
research workers in the sub-
sequent years, would be a much
fairer proposition than the-
existing status quo.
2. PG's versus Unions.
At present we are all sup-
posed to be members of the
students Union. In the past
ICU has tended to neglect
Postgraduates, partly due to
own fault, and partly due to
the lack of effective repres-
entation within the Union
hierarchy. There is a motion
pending, to make the PG Affairs
Officer a full member of the
Executive and it will be
interesting to see the reaction
of the UGM to this proposal.
Meanwhile, there are two other
Unions who are also interested
in Postgraduates — namely the
AUT and ASTMS. Out of these
two, a national agreement of
sorts has been reached with
ASTMS, but as far as the AUT
is concerned, they have been
hamstrung by their internal
bureaucracy and have got no
official policy on Postgraduates.
In my opinion, the best course
for Postgraduate students,
would be to continue as full
active members of ICU, but at
the same time to open up a
dialogue with other interested
unions.
3. Postgraduates and
Supervisors.
Any discussion on this issue
is fraught with obvious problems.
While I agree that it is not
possible to legislate for student-
supervisor relationships, the
present system is in need of
change.Col lectiveresponsibi I ity
by a group of supervisors for a
given number of students might
be a better alternative.
4. Overseas Postgraduates.
Having overseas Postgrad-
uates at Imperial College has
often been described as a means
of providing aid to developing
countries. This is far from
being the whole truth — ad-
mitting somebody from the
wilds of Papua to do a research
degree in plasma physics, is
of little or no benefit to the
people of Papua. Only projects
with some relevance to the
student's home country would
be of any benefit. Imperial
College, to the best of my
knowledge, only offers projects
and research work on topics
directly related to their country.
These are but sketchy
descriptions of the various
issues which we hope to con-
front. We would welcome any
reaction, from staff or students
on any of these issues. I will
try and give every point of view
full coverage in FELIX (I have
already negotiated for space).

Lecture by Dr. Simon Mitton.
R i c h a r d W a r i n g
Dr. Mitton attacked Von Daniken on his lecture on whether
extraterrestial life exists. For his pains he was viciously setupon
in question time by Daniken followers and allies in the audience.
The lecture began with a review of speculation about life in
our solar system. Topics mentioned ranged from religious dogma
(an Italian was burnt at the stake in the 1600's for suggesting a
plurality of inhabited worlds) to todays view that the only place
of biological interest, besides
earth, in our solar system is
Jupiter, with its complex mole-
cules which could form the
source of life. In between times
there were hoax dispatches
from Herschels observatory to
the New York Times consisting
of engravings of inhabitants of
the moon, and Howell with his
theories of Martian Canali and
civilisation.
Dr. Mitton then reminded us
that organic molecules have
been proved to exist in inter-
stellar space. The nebula
contain not only the material
to form stars but also the
building blocks of life. Planets
of other stars have been detected
by tiny fluctuations in the
stars position. So planets exist
and the material for life exists,
but does extraterrestial life?
Dr. Mitton moved on into what
was expected to be the most
interesting part of his lecture.
He stated, ' A s earth has not
been visited the number of
civilisations must be very
limited'. Heexplainedhis belief.
Many civilisations could not
agree to leave us alone. One
expanding civilisation would
fill the galaxy in 5,000 million
years. Interstellar travel was
not difficult and would always
be accomplished. Not all
civilisations would develop
on 'spiritual' rather than 'tech-
nical' lines.
Von Daniken's postulates,
he said, were too near what we
could achieve now; they were
just not imaginative enough to
be of worth as regards advanced
extraterrestials. UFO sightings
could all.be explained by the
idea of untrained observers and
meteorological phenomena.
Questioners in the audience
viciously attacked these last
two points; one of whom had
the closing word: 'Is it not
possible that the most imag-
inative teat that an advanced
visitor could produce would be
an edifice (such as the great
pyramids) which man would
only realise that it could not
have been constructed by his
ancestors until sufficiently
advanced?'. Dr. Mitton shrugged
said he had an open mind, and
left for Cambridge in his flying
saucer.
