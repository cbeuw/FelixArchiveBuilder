ECTOR OUT
A BLEAK FUTURE
LAST MONDAY night at the first Imperial College Union
Council meeting of the session, Sir Brian Flowers, the
Rector of the College, spoke of the 'bleak future' that faces
I.C. should the Government not step in with financial aid.
In an unprecedented speech
to the Union's premier com-
mittee, the Rector gave details
of recommendations which
are to be made to the College's
Board of Governors on
December 20th. To begin with
there is expected to be a 2%
cut across the board in College
expenditure. This may not seem
a very harsh move, but when
one considers that the vast
majority of theCollege'smoney
goes on salaries which will
not be cut, the fact is that
there will probably be cuts of
up to 15% on money which
people can still take decisions
on. There will be two ex-
clusions to the 2% cuts:
Firstly, maintenance because
if there were to be any cut-
back in that area, matters
could only become much worse;
and secondly, the grant to
the Union, for it is genuinely
felt by the Rector that we
have enough problems of our
own without having to suffer
a 2% cut.
The Rector put the
situation in a nutshell: 'For
Imperial College, the excess
of expenditure over income is
now running at the rate of
£500,000 per annum. If this
were to continue, in eighteen
months time Imperial College
would be in the red and unable
to meet its commitments —
unable to pay salary bills,
electricity bills etc'.
Whilst it is hoped that
Government aid via the Uni-
versity Grants Committee will
be forthcoming, if this were
not the case then further,
more drastic cuts may be
expected in the region of 6 to
8%. It would also appear
unlikely that the Union would
be excluded from these
measures.
Another subject which the
Rector broached during his
speech was the Murray Report.
This report was originally
commissioned to determine
how the University of London
could best organise itself
recognising its growth and the
inherent complexities ass-
ociated therewith.
One of the suggestions of
significance to the College
was that Imperial should lose
its present facility of direct
access to the U G C . This
particular suggestion, the
Rector stated, caused a big
stir when it was first pointed
out and many people in the
College were a l l for getting
out of the University and
going independent.
Since then things have
settled, the Murray Report
has been thrown out and a new
committee has been set up
of which the Rector is a
member and the Secretary is a
member of the Secretariat
which serves the committee.
This new committee's brief
is to plan the whole Uni-
versity's future for the next
quinquennium.
