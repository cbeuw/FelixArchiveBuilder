2 FELIX
EDITORIAL
M i k e W i l l i a m s
IN THIS special 'J'Accuse' edition
of FELIX, the Editor is under attack
(see page 4) from two individuals. It
is difficult to distinguish which has
made the bigger ass of himself. On a
prominent note our illustrious President
Trevor Phillips, at last stung in action,
has devoted more than half his PreciPice
to criticising FELIX. We are extremely
glad to have provided the President
with something to talk about. But what
has happened to the fine stirring issues
that occupied a whole page in the
Freshers' Edition? Few of those
topics have been subsequently broached.
Is it not only natural to ask what has
happened to the bold statements and
the fine rhetoric that was applauded
at the Freshers' address? Your phrase
'Ehobarbus to the Executive's Antony'
is apt.
The other 'attack' comes from the
only ex-assistant Editor of FELIX,
Mr. Clive G. Dewey, who has written
to give me a piece of his mind. An
incident worth mentioning occured in
connection with the letter. 1 had asked
Mr. Dewey if he could point out any
libel against him in any of the past
issues of FELIX. He looked. Pause.
He looked again. He found no libel.
Contentious matters of opinion, maybe,
but libel no.
Nevertheless, I am going to publicly
apologise to Mr. Dewey for any un-
intentional slights for which he feels
a certain redress may be necessary.
It is worth reiterating, however, that
the Editorial in question (Issue No. 364)
was, in fact, OK'd by John Allen,
Chairman of the Campus Radio Society.
The weekly 'Media meetings' held
in the FELIX oil ce every Friday
lunchtime and attended by Campus
Radio, STOIC, Broadsheet, Guildsheet
and Mines Newsletter bare their first
fruit in the form of our centre-spread
this week. It was discovered on Friday
11th that the RSMU 'Monkey Business'
was to take place the following morning.
Fortunately we were able to contact a
photographer and reporter for the
assignment, so all went well.
The point is, however, that it seems
as if it were almost by coincidence that
FELIX got to hear about the stunt at all.
it is hoped therefore, that the weekly
media meetings will establish a solid
communications network in Imperial
College.

Dear Sir,
So the election is over.
We can now view it in retrospect
and ponder its possible con-
sequences for ourselves. Then
we yield a bewildered sigh and
ask ourselves if all that fervour
was really justified. For me
the only vaguely inspiring
campaign was that of the 'don't
vote' advocates. Of course they
could not be described as a
united bunch; there were many
reasons given to discourage
voters, but their common de-
nominator was a feeling of the
futility of the whole masquerade.
People have begun to realise
that election campaigns, indeed
party policies in any situation,
are constructed from lies,
mudslinging and meaningless
catch phrases beautifully
illustrated by: 'Britain will
win with Labour', Put Britain
first, vote Conservative' and
'Put people first, join the
Liberal crusade'. The public
also realises that whichever
party wins, the difference it
makes to the individual is
entirely negligible.
One slogan which captures
well the mood of the electorate
is that of the Liberals 'Take
Power, Vote Liberal'. There is
growing frustration in Britain
due to the belief that the
country is being run by a
small number of remote pol-
iticians who don't give a damn
about the individuals who make
up the population, and who
would dearly love to have more
say in the running of their
lives. There is evidence every-
where that people are becoming
increasingly alienated from the
country's power structure,
alienated from their jobs and
alienated from the lifestyle that
this technological age has
forced upon them. For example,
take the rejection of fluoridation
proposals or protestation
against motorway routes both
organised at the local leveL
People who are normally power-
less take advantage of their
opportunities to express re-
sentment of political authority.
There are any number of small
protest groups, community groups
and sympathy groups growing
up all round us in defiance of
our centralised authoritarian
government.
Fidel Castro said It is the
aim of the Cuban revolution to
make every man a legislator'.
A fine sentiment and it is more
the pity that the Cuban govern-
ment has to be repressive in
order to make their system
work. Of course in Marx's ideal
the state is merely transient
and, given time, it will 'wither
away' leaving a true democracy.
But how long do we have to
wait? Looking at today's
communist countries the time

when the state will wither is
remote, to say the least.
Capitalist and communist
governments alike operate with
extreme centralisation and they
all take the responsibility for
deciding 'what is good for the
people'. Their justification for
this lies in some doubt about
human nature. They believe,
and they lead us to believe,
that there is some inherent
disruptive force in the human
character and this means that
we cannot, of our own volition,
live in a moral and civilised
manner. There is no such thing,
they say, as an autonomous
ethical person.
It would be nice to think
that the twelve million people
who did not vote in this election
