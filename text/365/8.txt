LAST YEAR'S Hi-Fi Society tended to cater for people with
expensive equipment and I believe this is why it all but folded up.
This year the society hopes to continue under a policy which will
cater for all members of the college interested in listening to
recorded music and other audio matter. For this reason the all
embracing title of 'Imperial
College Audio Society' has
been assumed. The first in a
series of informal talks is to
be given by Basil Lane (Assis-
tant Editor of Wireless World),
on Wednesday 23rd October at
7.30 in the Union Senior
Common Room. It is entitled
'Damn Hi-Fi! Let's listen to
the Music' and will be illus-
trated by some good sounds
and slides. Everyone is welcome
and a membership fee of 20p is
payable at the door; membership
entitles you to attend all Audio
Society lectures and recitals
at no extra charge, and free
advice on all audio matters
from the committee, (eg. Is it
worth buying cassettes? Are
there any decent loudspeakers
under £70? Where can I listen
to a really good system at my
leisure? etc.).
Anyone who thinks he (or
she) may be able to help on
the committee, please contact
me as soon as possible so that
your ideas may be incorporated
into the programme for this
term. Apart from the full scale
lectures and demonstrations,
we hope to arrange evening or
lunchtime concerts of recorded
music on a regular basis', these
were most successful last year.
All suggestions gratefully
received. Next term we are
hoping to have the support of
several manufacturers, including
Decca, Rank, Quad and Lecson.
To continue the series of talks,
there will be a lecture and
demonstration by Clement Brown,
editor of the Haymarket Hi-Fi
Publications. See you all on
Wednesday.

The Odessa File (Jon Voight,
Maximilian Schell. Director: Ronald
Neame).
NOT HAVING the advantage (or
should it be prejudice?) of having read
the book, this film presented itself as
an above-average cloak and dagger epic.
There were no gimmicks, no ass'ing
about except for one short episode where
a 'baddie' crashes through the glass
roof of printing works and impales
himself on a spike protruding from a
letterpress printing press. (Correct, it
would not have happened had it been
offset-litho).
Jon Voight plays Peter Miller, a free-
lance journalist, who comes across the
diary of an old Jew who was in a con-
centration camp during the war. The
diary tells the story of an SS officer
called Roschmann {Maximilian Schell)
who was a murderer, butcher and generally
an unsociable person. The diary ends
with the revelation that Roschmann is
still at large in Germany, being a top
Michael Williams
executive in a large company.
Miller decides to track him down and
soon comes up against the Odessa, a
group of ex-SS officers with pots of
money. It works out that Roschmann's
company is near to perfecting a tele-
guidance system which will direct
biological warheads towards the large
cities of Israel on behalf of Egypt's
President Nasser. Nasty business this.
The Israeli Intelligence get involved,
Miller nearly gets killed a couple of
