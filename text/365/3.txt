IF / Mine's Dance or Not so much a cattle market more a
cattle show.
Last Thursday evening saw the opening of what promise's to
be a very exciting season for both Mines United and IF Wanderers.
Mines were playing at home and felt a distinct advantage but IF
are familiar with the pitch and were confident. Kick off was due
at eight o'clock but there was some trouble opening the gates
(bolt failure) and the match finally started ten minutes late.
From the start officials
had trouble controlling the
enthusiasm of the crowd and
club manager, Pat Gorman,
expressed concern that IF
supporters might break down
the barriers but his fear was
unfounded and the fans were
on the whole well-behaved.
Both clubs were very well
supported, a fact which is
quite unprecedented for IF
who have in the past suffered
a great deal from the indifference
of its members.
The evening began by
Saunders and Butler opening
the play. An unparalleled
display of skill wasin evidence,
no doubt due to the intensive
training sessions both players
have undergone during the
past few weeks. However,
Catchpole was not to be out-
done and with a crafty
interception left the ball in the
competent hands of Griffiths
who was then disqualified for
handling. The game gathered
pace as Caleott, marked by
Partridge, led the team upfield
and the rest of the players
started pulling their weight.
By half-time it was neck and
neck.
After the interval the
players returned, visibly
refreshed, to take up their
positions and play recommenced.
Bai ley, with Robinson'shacking,
seemed to make good headway
but after a three minute spell,
threw away a good chance of a
goal and proceeded for the
rest of the game to back up
the morale of the team. The
match was finally decided in
the closing three minutes of
the game when IF, demoralised
by the skilful passing by the
Mines team, were caught with
their defences down; Mines
moved quickly into attack and
scored the winning goal.
However, there was no hard
feelings amongst the IF players,
a good time was had by all and
it is hoped that there will be
a return match in the very
near future.
As usual, rumour rears its
ugly head in the shady corridors
of IC and speculator, falls on
a certain Alexandre Esq.,
inmate of IF. Have we indeed
admitted a MALE into the
sacred precincts of IF? Who
is this Alexandre who presides
at all our events, accompanies
us on all our trips and keeps
a beady eye on our Union
affairs? He certainly seems
to have a lot of success with
all the girls from IF (was even
seen being hugged by several
of them in the vicinity of
Freshers' Fair). Alexandre
is in fact our revered mascot.
He can be identified from any
common or garden teddy bear
by his IF T-shirt and scarf —
what exceptionally good taste!
(You too, can obtain either of
these much-coveted items
from our Union Office for a
mere two pounds each). For
those of you unfortunate enough
to have overlooked Alexandre,
you will have the opportunity
of seeing him at all of the IF
functions during the coming
year. These will hopefully
include a disco towards the
end of term, a review (in-
finitely more respectable than
any of the IC reviews and a lot
funnier, too) and also a dinner
dance. However, we will keep
you informed and incidentally
we shall endeavour to make
our posters less attractive
this year so that, rather than
decorate your rooms, they
will stay up long enough to be
read!

You have all probably
seen this young lady around
and people in RCS should
know her quite well. Her
name is Louise John and she
is in Physics I. She hails
from the Welsh town of
Flanelli and was unlucky
to come only second in the
Queen of Jez competition
(who were the piss-artists
that did the judging?).
Louise has taken an active
interest in rag and other
events (she took part in the
tiddly-winks race) and is a
keen squash player. With
such vivacity and good
looks she should go far and
do well.
