IT HAS never been the Union's policy,
or the intention of itsofficers, to interfere
in any way with the Editorial independence
of the Union's publications, nor is it my
intention in this article, to enter any
dialogue on debate with FELIX on
material that has been printed in the
paper.
However, if the Union finances a
publication, I think that it has a right
and a duty to expect certain standards
of accuracy in reporting and of pres-
entation. Let me hasten to say that in
both respects, this year's FELIX is
superior to those that have gone before;
but I feel that it might be in order for me
to point to a tew instances through which
the Union might have suffered.
Firstly, there was the Court Line
disaster. The sentence which read
'Courtline has Imperial College as
one of its creditors to the extent of
£25,000', was, of course, libellous.
Action could have been taken against
the Union, purely because of sloppy
reporting. In that respect, I think that
the Union has a right to be concerned.
Secondly, we come on to the issues,
internal in nature, where FELIX, no
doubt, has attempted to play the role of
Enobarbus to the Executive's Antony;
bringing us down to earth, exposing our
shortcomings and puncturing our egos.
I note, for instance, in the FELIX Mid-
week Special of 3rd October, that the
Editor says that we had 'pretentiously
decided' that he would be Publicity
Officer. What we were doing, in fact,
was interpreting previous policy, which
is, historically, one of the Executive's
roles.
In the FELIX of 11th October, the
Editor decided to feature the last UGM
and the poor attendance at that meeting.
He puts it down to poor quality of the
Trev Phillips
UGM. Now, for the 1st UGM of the year,
what is likely to attract people? Surely,
the publicity for the event; but Mike
himseIf says that this i s his responsibi I i ty-
so who is at fault? The most widely
expressed opinion about the UGM that I
have heard was that the publicity for the
meeting was 'pusillanimous and
uninspiring in the extreme', to quote the
Editor. The posters were not outstanding;
in fact, I think that the Publicity Officer
should admit that at least half the work
(including all the distribution) was done
by myself; and that is not my job. I
accept that, since Mike had no other help
in this task, it was difficult; but the
blame should not be shifted (however
subtly) on to the Executive.
Finally, we did have a few cans of
lager in whi le doing Parking applications;
would you sit and mark crappy, boring
applications for 6V2 hours at a stretch,
without some refreshment?
I noted Mr. R.J. Merwood's letter in
the last FELIX. He raised several issues
of crucial importance to students,
particularly accommodation, student
maintenance and academic problems.
Yet he claims to be alarmed at the in-
trusion of 'politics' into student affairs.
Politics, Mr. Merwood, is the art of
government; are grants, accommodation,
and education abstract issues that bear
no relation to the condition of our
society, and therefore are not affected
in anyway by the governance of that
society?
If they are. who determines grant
levels, the way we are taught and so on,
and with what priorities? I think that
anything but a very narrow view will
show that most issues that involve the
conditions of work and quality of life
for students are very strongly influenced
by external factors.
You may escape that conclusion;
but I am entrusted with the responsibility
to find solutions to your problems and I
cannot escape it. I do not expect anyone
to call for a revolution in IC; but I do
expect people to take a balanced, mature
and progressive view — isn't this what
education is about?
Reports for UGM's will not be read
out in future; you should be able to get
hold of duplicated reports before UGM's
in your pigeonholes; there will now be
no 'Report' items, just 'Question Time'.
This should cut out the boring bits.
(Bitch, bitch. Agreed the Courtline
story was libellous, but the reporting
was not 'sloppy' since it was reported
in good faith from two separate sources.
As far as the 'prele'nliously decided'
bit, the word 'decided' was actually
used by one of your Executive. It was
simply and only the use of that part-
icular word which warranted the mention
of the incident. UtiM et al: I did not
say in my Editoral that the poor attend-
ance was due to the poor quality of the
UGM. That is your own rather sloppy
interpretation. As regards blaming the
posters for a poor attendance, that
must surely be the cheapest trick of
all. Clearly, against such opposition
as Vic Feather, the posters deserve
credit for the response they produced
(he said tongue in cheek) — Editor).
LETTERS cont'd
were expressing some sort of
protest. It would be fair to
believe that the last two
elections have shown that the
public are not prepared to give
a mandate to any party, to
govern in the present system.
People are beginning to object
to the Westminster centralisation
of power. Until something
happens, we will live out our
powerlessness and meaning-
lessness lives with the Labour
government.
Yours faithfully,

Sir,
I should like to complain
about a paragraph in your last
Editorial, published in FELIX
on 11th October '74. In it, you
apologised to John Allen and
the other committee members
of IC Campus Radio Society,
for what you termed a 'regretful
error' inyourpreviousEditonal.
You claim that you 'had, in all
honesty, been led to believe'
that one individual had been
essentially responsible for
establishing Campus Radio.
For the benefit of FELIX
readers I should like to point
out your blatant and deliberate
attempt to mislead and deceive
them. When you appointed me
as an Assistant Editor to
FELIX in June, I made a point
of informing you that ICCRS
was run by a committee of
seven people; each having an
equal responsibility for the
work necessary to establish
a Student Radio Station here.
If this hadn't been the case,
and I, solely had been res-
ponsible for establishing it,
I would not have become an
Assistant Editor; and 1 hope,
for the sake of FELIX, that
you would not have appointed
me.
You had a more recent
reminder of this, just before
the beginning of this term. In
the freshers' Editorial of
FELIX, I wrote a piece about
IC Radio, and advised anyone
interested to come and see
eitherme, or four other members
of the committee, whose
college addresses were
supplied. Of the remaining
two committee members, one
is a technician in Electrical
Engineering, and the other a
physicist whose hall address
was not known at the time.
You can not claim that you
had nothing to do with the
article, since you edited it,
and I was in the office when
you did so.
Whilst I may have done
some active campaigning for
Campus Radio you were under
no illusions that a committee
was establishing it rather than
just one person. I therefore,
think that an apology is due,
not only to me and the other
six hard-working committee
members of ICCRS, but to
everyone who reads FELIX
for the deceitful and des-
picable way in which you
have used your position as
Editor. Should you wish to
continue slights of this sort,
I have no doubt that your
actions will eventually lead
to your being sued for libel.
As someone who is dedicated
to providing IC with a better
media service, I hope that
your jibes at me and IC Radio
will cease, so that ICCRS
can get on with the job in
hand, rather than be continually
asking you for Editorial
apologies. Only in this way-
can IC Radio, FELIX and
STOIC work together to
improve the media here.
Yours faithfully,
Clive G. Dewey.
(It seems to me a great pity
that you did not rather more
closely consult your committee
before writing this letter. Mr.
John Allen, the Chairman of
the Campus Radio Society,
had in fact OK'd the Editorial
in question so a second
apology to John would be
quite unnecessary. As regards
your own position in Campus
Radio, I was genuinely of ihe
opinion that you were seen to
be doing a lot of work. The
conjecture was, albeit wrong,
that you were establishing
Campus Radio. This is still
popular opinion, as some of
your own committee will tell
you.
As far as your spiteful
comments regarding my
position as Editor, this sort
of tantrum is to be expected
after one's pride is hurt so
I'll say no more.)
Correspondence on this
subject is now closed.
