Despite an appalling lack of fresh blood (spikes, barbed wire
etc., to be spilled on) and the where was last week's F E L I X
report inquisition, the IC Cross Country teams have started with
a bang. Already they have won more races then they did over the
whole of last season.
We have thrashed not only
Sussex University, not only the
L S E , but also Kings College.
All by huge point scores and
vast distances. This must be
due to the 'Go faster' Allinson
(who always wins, damn him)
and the Speedy Steve who is
still retaining second place,
just.
The IC 3rd team suffered a
notable loss as Dave Payne
hit a tree trunk and sprained an
ankle, but at least Bob and
Pad managed to get him back
home (only 25mins. late, folks).
Dave is now recovering in the
Union bar and is expected to
be fit in about three weeks.
In fact, it must be noted
that the whole team is re-
markably fit. Pad Donnelly is
beating L S E runners, this
season, even the inaugural
meeting of the Bell Sniffing
society went according to plan.
If a little noisy.
Events to look forward to
include the UC Relay (this
Saturday), the second meeting
of the Bell Sniffing society (Ad
Hoc), the first League Race
(23rd October) and the first
football match.

The 2nd XI 'bullied off
the season on Saturday with a
massacre of Goldsmiths (7-2).
The scoreline reflects the
dominance of IC in every sector
of the pitch. The forward line
were particularly keen and alert
with Bruno Speed and A.N.Other
both netting hatfuls. Chas
Hardy helped himself to the
seventh. All goals were well
taken and stemmed from good
midfield play.
The first of the goals
conceded was a bad defensive
error and the second an in-
evitable result of complacency
at being 7-1 up.
The teamwork was quite
astounding for the first mater,
of the season and I would like
to take this opportunity to
congratulate the team on a
superb performance. (P.S. As
an incentive to play next week,
there is one jug still owing!).
Team: N. Harrison. J. Hackle,
P. Nair. Y. Tan. A. Hall,
D. Balderson, P. Nowell,
I. Read, B. Speed. I. McLean,
C. Hardy.
Using five stalwarts from
the second team to boost
numbers, the Thirds took to the
field in fine form, losing 4-0 to
Camberley.
Most people were glad they
owned shin pads, both during
the game and after, when
Arthurs-Minions produced their
hyper-crusty shepherds pie, in
traditional Cordon-Bennet
mould. Mould — yes, every now
and then I hit on an appropriate
word.
Still - this is what hockey
is all about — to misquote
Jimmy Hill. We hope for better
things later in the season
(perhaps curry?) when the team
settles down.
Thanks to all who played.
As we drive off into the new season it is pleasant to note that
almost all the people who spearheaded IC's overdue success in
top flight golf last year are still with us. Indeed with the exception
of Chris Cobbledick (who has retired to the gentler pursuit of
rugby) all our London University players are still keen to play an
active role in the battle ahead.
As for those who did not play
for London University but
instead chose to reserve their
energies for the more select IC
team, we can still rely on our
stalwarts, many of whom are
playing so well now that last
years captain (the author) has
felt it expedient to retire from
his post lest he found it im-
possible to justify a place in
his own team. Indeed such
was his concern, that he has
now taken on the less rigourous
captaincy of a London Univer-
sity team which he feels obliged
to mention, will be heavily
biased towards IC. Such is the
importance of an IC union card
for selection that Tony Jacklin
has elected to join Civ. Eng.
rather than the US circuit this
year (a pre-press release!).
But this is not all. In our
influx of freshers there appear
to be some players of except-
ional stature from whose divot-
marks the future of the society
will be forged. Of the.se Edward
Clutton (3 handicaps) looks the
pick but there is an interesting
9-handicagjpef Bob Allan who
could prove a bandit off that
mark and win the 'Rookie of the
Year' award. It was probably
with this in mind that the
members have elected him to
the Vice-Captaincy hoping to
shorten his swing with paper-
work. On this matter I recall
remaining aloof since the swing
shortening that resulted from
the abundance of secretarial
work we fed Jules Dan last year
resulted in his playing beyond
his wildest dream (not a pretty
sight!). His trophy stealing off
a cleptomaniac's 24 handicap
is now in the history books.
Let's hope it stays there!
An interesting feature at the
Freshers' Fair this year was
the enthusiasm of many ladies
who wished to join the society.
My immediate reaction was
'No! This would leave a dis-
chotimy in many team members
minds as to which 'hole-in-one'
is of more importance!'However
both the charm of the ladies
concerned mingled with the
keenness of our men members
to play the game with these
Iad'es, has led to an historic
aecision of the committee to no
longer bar women on account of
their sex.
The captaincy this year has
gone to How Rosser, a man
familiar with all the devious
twists and turns that golf so
readily imposes.Onhis shoulders
the society can only blossom
and with the likes of B i l l
Calderwood (Sec), Mike Marx
(Treas.) and aforementioned
Bob Allen (V-Capt.) as his
committee perhaps we are headed
for a very special season.
Only time can tell.
It only remains for me to
register my gratitude to all
those who so ably assisted me
in making last year so enjoyable.
The climax of the year for me
was our victory in the South
and Eastern University Champ-
ionships, as memorable an
achievementas itwas remarkable.

IC Extra lsts made a very
good start to the season in their
first game which was against
Old Kingsburians. After pres-
suring the opposition for the
first five minutes a dropped ball
led to a lucky break for Old
Kingsburians and they got their
one and only try.
Finally the hard work payed
off and things started to click.
S. Ladle opened up the scoring
and from then on the game
looked onesided with the score
16-4 at half time. The backs
tried varying moves and with
forwards in constant support
IC overan the opposition with a
final score of 60-4.
I hope this is a premonition
for what the rest of the season
will be like for us. More players
are needed so that we can get
more sides out and give every*
one a game. See Bruce Bradley,
Rob Jones or myself if you
want a game on Saturdays.
