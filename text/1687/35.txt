Day 11 – Stage 11A
H
aving set our
minds on doing
the alternative
high route in
pursuit of more stunning
views, we agreed to leave
at 7am. The girls were
punctual as always, and
at 7am they went to the
boys tent to find them still
sleeping! But the boys
overslept after having a
nightmare with the tent
in the strong overnight
winds. Agreeing on the
shorter, easier low route,
weenjoyedahotchocolate
in the refuge before setting
off. We were delighted to
find that the terrain was
even easier than yesterday
and we completed the
14km to Refuge di Verdi
by midday. We were
hoping to push on to
Refuge de Prati, 4.5km
into tomorrow’s stage,
and where Max had de-
cided to stay tonight. This
would nearly halve the
1290 metres of climbing
involved in stage 12.
However, another group
of hikers told us they’d
just come down from
there due to high winds.
After a good half-hour
reading Asterix & Obelix
en Corse and playing
cards with our new
German friends, Felix and
Caroline – Ironman triath-
letes who were hiking the
GR20 for their third time.
With strong winds
forecast to continue for
the rest of the day, the
refuge staff advised us that
nobody should attempt
the high route today, since
it involves traversing an
exposed arête that would
be dangerous in high
winds
Day 12 – Stage 12
Felix and Caroline
somehow managed to
convince us to put ri-
diculous o’clock alarms
on again to climb up the
mountain before sunrise,
but when we woke up and
stuck our heads out the
tents, there wasn’t a star
in sight. We concluded
it’d be too cloudy for a
decent view so happily
fell back asleep, setting
off at a more reasonable
6am instead. Today’s hike
involved two main climbs
– the first up to the refuge
we considered staying at
last night, at 1820 metres
(and Punta Mozza slightly
higher up), and the other
a steeper boulder-studded
climb that zigzagged up to
Monte Furmicula, at 1981
metres. It was just as we
began the final descent
towards Refuge d’Usciolu
that the rain began, and
once it started it did not
relent. We miserably
pitched our tents in the
rain, shivering from the
cold, and ate our dinner
in bed before going to
sleep at 5pm (well trying
to sleep anyway…). The
night that ensued was
one of the worst any of
us could recall. Water
pooled under our tents
and our flip-flops could
be seen floating in the
outer. Everything got wet,
and even in all our layers
and our survival blankets
we were freezing in our
sleeping bags. But it was
the boys, and Harry in par-
ticular, who had it worst.
After feasting on the world
famous Corsican cheese,
which according to some
authors (see Uderzo et
Goscinny, 1973) has the
power to defeat an entire
Roman legion, he was
ill and threw up all over
his sleeping bag, hiking
boots, and tent. Georgios
was not best impressed!
Day 13 – Stage 13/14
That morning was the
lowest point of the expe-
dition.
The rain had stopped
and the sun was shining,
but it was still very cold.
During the night, the boys
covered themselves with
their survival bags, as the
water pooling bellow the
tent had a freezing effect.
However, they didn’t
account for perspiration
and when they woke up,
any clothes that were not
wet because of the rain
were wet because of their
sweat. To top that they had
to climb a 100m cliff in
order to get the icy water
needed for the tent to be
cleaned.
Tensions between
the members were high,
and understandably so.
No one had a relaxing
sleep and as girls were
once again ready on time
so they had to wait for
around an hour, and were
not pleased. However,
after they learned about
last night they were more
understanding and helped
the boys pack up faster!
Despite our intentions
to double today, everyone
was feeling quite grim,
“After 30 mins
of debating
whether to
push on or
not, Georgios
grabbed the
bull by the
horns and we
flipped a coin”
of debating whether to
push on or not, Georgios
grabbed the bull by the
horns and we flipped a
coin… tails we’re staying.
So we spent the rest of
the afternoon by the fire
“After feasting

famous
Corsican
cheese, Harry
was ill and
threw up over
his tent”
The barren landscape // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos
so we were unsure as to
whether we’d be up for
the double stage, but we
didn’t have to decide until
the turning, which was
two hours into the day.
Our kit was wet from the
night from hell last night
so our bags were heavier
and the going was very
tough as we scrambled
across the arête. We even-
tually found our rhythm
though, and gritted
through both stages. It
was the afternoon ascent
of Monte Alcudina that
really challenged us.
Before the climb even
began we’d already had
a long day’s undulating
hike; the incline was
never ending and seemed
to get perpetually steeper.
As more mountains kept
appearing above us,
even Harry (who usually
powers up the ascents)
was left broken and
collapsed in a heap at the
top! We were glad to see
Refuge d’Asinau only a
short descent from the
peak and spent the evening
desperately trying to get
warm in the communal
tent space with the other
hikers. Another cold night
ensued and everyone
except Carla (who seems
to sleep through abso-
lutely anything) were
kept awake by hail and a
thunderstorm which left
the mountain covered in
ice and snow when we
awoke the next morning.
ence the boys were ready
on time! Perhaps even
slightly before Diane and
Carla, so they claimed.
We set off, actually as
planned, at 9am for the
high route. Only 8km
long, it involved a steep
ascent up to Aiguilles de
Bavella which provided
a beautiful view over the
East and South Coast from
the rocky towers at the
summit. The penultimate
day of our expedition and
we got our first peek of the
finish. The descent was
full of day walkers, filling
us with anticipation of the
small taste of civilisation
waiting for us in Village
de Bavella at the foot of
the mountain. We could
almost smell the pizzeria
(which had a working
oven this time – thank
goodness!). Only 2.5km
of hiking away, it took
nearly two hours for us to
complete the incredibly
steep, rocky descent in-
volving the use of chains
in places. One part in
particular involved a giant
sloping slab of rock sur-
mounted by an enormous
jammed boulder which
we heaved our way up on
the chain then squeezed
through a gap at the top.
Once the day’s work was
over, we booked into
the gite d’etape (there
were no campsites in the
village) and went straight
for pizza. We thoroughly
gorged ourselves in the
food we’d been dreaming
about for days before
a late afternoon nap to
revitalise ourselves for
the three course evening
meal included with our
accommodation! It was as
if tonight was an appetiser
for the luxuries we could
enjoy when we complete
the trail tomorrow.
Day 15 – Stage 16
Knowing only a matter
of hours separated us from
the end of the hardest trail
in Europe, we relaxed
(perhaps too much) at
breakfast, feasting on
bread and Corsican jams
and left to the sound
of live Russian music
performed by Harry. We
took our time, relishing
the last 19km of the GR20
with Alex and Mandus,
taking in the views for
a final time. We all wore
our team expedition polo
shirts and took group
photos at every opportu-
nity. Our legs were weary,
especially Harry’s, whose
ankle was causing him
trouble again on the tricky
terrain, but we pushed
on, reminiscing about our
journey across the island.
Today the landscape was
like that of a different
country all together, as
we descended away from
the mountainous spine of
Corsica and own into the
forests towards the sea.
Even the pools we bathed
in 5km from the end were
described as ‘lukewarm’
in the guidebook. They
were by no means any de-
scription of warm but they
“We eventually
found our
rhythm
though,
and gritted
through both
stages of the
climb”
Day 14 – Stage 15B
It was a momentous
morning – for the first
time in our GR20 experi-
were much more bearable
than the mountain lakes
and rivers we’d paddled in
on previous days.The final
few kilometres seemed to
last forever but eventually
we rounded a bend to a
view of Conca not far
below us. There was a lot
of excitement and pride
as we strode down into
the village, where we
were greeted by… well
practically nothing! No
glorious finish line or
souvenir shops. There was
barely even a sign to tell
us where the official end
actually was! But there
was one small bar in the
village where we found
many of the hikers we’d
shared our journey with,
and just down the road
was Max.
More than 2 weeks
of trekking through the
Corsican mountains had
come to an end. We all
agreed it was one of, if
not the, best thing we’d
ever done. We’d met
some incredible people,
bonded as a team, learnt
some French (perhaps not
Diane), seen the geology
of the entire backbone of
Corsica and, above all,
completed the hardest trail
in Europe. We’re incred-
ible grateful to Imperial
Exploration Board and
the RSM trust for funding
our expedition, and hope
our adventure will inspire
other students to under-
take similar challenges.
