Investment properties, White City developments, and
combined – and is greater
than that owned by the
University of Oxford.
Imperial also has a
large number of properties
currently under construc-
tion: at the end of the past
academic year they had
£327 million in properties
currently under construc-
tion – the most out of any
large London university,
including UCL and King’s
College London. UCL’s
rapid expansion has
come under fire recently,
after academics backed
a motion of no confi-
dence in the university’s
leadership. One of the
UK’s leading judges said
UCL management was
“intent on driving through
a programme of rapid
expansion… exposing it
to serious financial and
academic risks”.
When asked how the
College would ensure
current levels of growth
are sustainable, a spokes-
person said: “We have a
balanced and sustainable
strategy for expansion. We
are building a mixture of
investment assets which
will provide income in the
future as well as academic
facilities which will allow
us to deliver our core
mission.” Last year the
College invested roughly
£200 million in its estate,
including projects in
South Kensington and
White City.
Imperial Accommo-
dation
Imperial has also been
rapidly expanding the
amount of student accom-
modation it owns, increas-
ing bedspaces by nearly
a fifth over the past five
years. The College owns
more than 3,500 bedspac-
es – more than LSE and
QMUL, but fewer than
UCL or KCL. Space for
undergraduate students,
however, remains tight: in
last year’s annual report,
the College reported its
growth in enrolments was
“weighted towards post-
graduates to avoid putting
strain on our commitment
to provide all first-year
undergraduates with a
room in halls”.
While the College
promises to provide all
first-year undergraduates
with accommodation,
its current holdings do
not allow it to do so: this
academic year, Imperial
accepted 2,715 students,
but currently only owns
2,484 bedspaces, not in-
cluding those in GradPad.
As a result, Imperial
offers students spaces at
halls which are not owned
and/or operated by the
College, such as Xenia,
which provides space for
nearly 150 students and is
operated by the Salvation
Army Housing Associa-
tion (SAHA).
One way Imperial will
be trying to make up the
shortfall is with new ac-
commodation outside of
central London. In 2015 it
opened Woodward Build-
ings, a 19-storey building
in North Acton with space
for 690 students. Last year
it acquired another plot of
land in Acton, which will
be used to expand the
student accommodation
on offer to around 1,300
bedspaces. The College
says this will be done to
ensure it has “the critical
mass needed to develop a
vibrant student hub”. The
new hall will form part
of the undergraduate first
to the South Kensington
campus: an en-suite room
at Woodward Buildings
costs £131 per week,
compared to £232 for a
room in Eastside Halls.
Construction of
Woodward Buildings has
allowed Imperial to keep
its average rent increase
year-on-year to around
2.5%, slightly above the
average inflation rate for
the period: in 2012, the
average room in Imperi-
al-owned undergraduate
accommodation was
£155/week, compared to
around £175/week this
year.
The year Woodward
Buildings opened saw a
sharp increase in rent for
central student accommo-
dation, following lobby-
ing by Imperial College
Union (ICU) to restructure
pricing of halls. Between
September 2014 and Sep-
tember 2015, the average
rent in central London
halls owned by Imperial –
including Eastside, South-
side, Wilson House, and
Pembridge – increased by
nearly £30, from £166/
week to £193/week. At
the time, Tom Wheeler,
then Union President,
said: “It is fantastic that
as a result of our lobbying
we have secured lower
rent for over 1,000 future
students.”
According to data
rental income of £720,000
each week – more than
any other London uni-
versity bar KCL, which
owns around 40% more
bedspaces than Imperial.
In a statement for Felix,
a College representative
said Imperial did not
profit from student rents:
“The College’s approach
to pricing is to ensure
rental income covers the
college’s maintenance,
capital and running costs
for accommodation,
but does not generate
a surplus from student
rents. Student rents are set
every five years and the
College will consult with
the Union in the same way
when it comes to setting
rents for the next five year
period.”
At the beginning of
this academic year, it
was revealed Woodward
Buildings had failed fire
safety tests carried out on
its cladding in the wake of
the tragic Grenfell Tower
fire. While having sections
of cladding that failed
government-ordered tests,
Woodward Buildings
were confirmed “safe for
occupancy” by fire safety
teams. A review of the
rest of Imperial’s halls
found none used unsafe
cladding. Woodward
Buildings is still awaiting
new cladding.
Imperial and Grad-
Pad
Postgraduate accom-
modation has also been an
area in which Imperial has
realised a profit over the
past few years. Imperial
owns accommodation for
over 1,000 postgraduate
students across two
blocks marketed under the
brand “GradPad”, which
describes itself as “Lon-
don’s premier provider
of postgraduate student
accommodation”.

es – Griffon Studios in
Battersea, and Wood Lane
Studios on the North Site

"Imperial has
increased rent
over the last
few years, with
the average
now standing
at £175/week”

bedspaces were rented
out, it would generate a
luxury postgraduate accommodation owned by College
of Imperial’s White City
campus – are owned by
Imperial, but operated by
UPP, which manages over
32,000 rooms in the UK.
Prices at GradPad start
at £219/week, but go up
to £430/week; all con-
tracts are for 51 weeks.
If all rooms available
in GradPad were rented
out this academic year,
it would produce nearly
£300,000 in rental income
each week – over 40% of
all potential income from
student rents.
The most expensive
rooms at GradPad, which
can be found in the Wood
Lane complex, are among
the most expensive of all
university-owned accom-
modation – 50% more
expensive than UCL’s
most expensive offering.
Felix spoke to one
postgraduate student, who
lived in GradPad’s Batter-
sea property last academic
year, who said they had “a
good experience overall”.
They highlighted features
like the gym, the con-
venience, and “the desk
staff were really nice and
helpful”. “I think Imperial is very
pro-pushing people to
use GradPad. If you go
onto the website there’s
no advice for PG accom-
modation, or find-a-friend
website; you have to show
your own initiative to not
end up going there. I had
GradPad pushed on me”.
They also said they
felt international students
were more likely to
feel compelled to use
GradPad: “A lot of people
who stay there are inter-
national, and I think they
get screwed over. The
way [Imperial] targets it is
very much ‘this is the sim-
plest solution, you won’t
have to worry about it’,
and I think that appeals to
people who are travelling
overseas, who can’t see
the properties.”
These concerns were
echoed by a number of
postgraduate students
Felix spoke to. One
student approaching the
end of their PhD at Imperi-
al after moving from UCL
said it wasn’t an isolated
problem: “Neither UCL
nor Imperial were any
help finding accommoda-
tion, at least not in a pro-
active way. I tried looking
at the Imperial accredited
private accommodation
page, but the options were
scarce and expensive.”
Another student, who
completed their PhD at the
end of the past academic
year, told Felix that while
GradPad had “very nice
facilities” and “was worth
it if you could afford it”,
it was not an option for
those on the minimum
stipend.
“They market it at
everyone, including those
who may not realise they
can’t afford it, and they
don’t give any alternatives
for people who have to
look elsewhere. Some
make the assumption they
can afford it, because you
should be able to afford
what Imperial recom-
mends, even if you’re on
the minimum stipend.
“While I don’t have
any problems with
GradPad itself – I don’t
think it's unfairly priced
considering the benefits,
and compared to similar
halls aimed at young pro-
fessionals – I take issue
with the fact there’s no
alternative or support for
most students who will
not be able to afford it.
Imperial should do more
to ensure the marketing
that gets to students pro-
vides options for students
of all background to allow
them to live comfortably
and safely, instead of just
passing on information
relevant to the wealthiest
subset and leaving the rest
to figure it out.”
The only option for
postgraduate students Im-
perial currently lists on its
accommodation webpage
for those outside Silwood
Park is GradPad. While
it does have a private
accommodation guide,
and puts on events aimed
at helping people find
private accommodation,
there is no information
specific to postgraduate
students.
In a statement, a
College spokesperson
said: “All students have
Imperial is rapidly expanding into the White City area // Imperial
“Imperial has
been accused
of aggressively
marketing
GradPad, its
luxury PG
studios”
However, they also
pointed out: “One thing
that annoyed me the most
was there’s no oven in
the accommodation. You
have hob space, but it gets
to a point where you’re
like ‘oh god, why do I not
have an oven?’ That was
really frustrating.” Having
individual kitchens meant
“it was quite an antisocial
environment”, with “no
encouragement of social
interaction”.
They highlighted how
much Imperial had pro-
moted GradPad before
they started their course: GradPad studios go for up to £430/week // Imperial
access to Imperial Home
Solutions, an online
website managed by the
Student Hub promoting
private landlords as well
as other purpose built
student halls. We do send
information on GradPad
to students when they
accept their place as it
can be a more conven-
ient option for overseas
postgraduate students as
it can be organised before
they arrive in the UK - but
postgraduate students are
informed via the website
about the options in the
private rental sector as
well.”
As well as GradPad,
Imperial previously had
holdings in other post-
graduate accommodation.
Last year it sold a block
of postgraduate accom-
modation to another
provider, which has since
marketed it to undergrad-
uates; having acquired the
property in 2012, Imperial
made a total profit of £9.2
million.

It is unclear whether or
not the accommodation to
be constructed will be as
affordable as that on offer
at Woodward Buildings,
which is currently subsi-
dised compared to similar
accommodation nearby.
The accommodation
available at Woodward is
significantly cheaper than
rooms available closer
