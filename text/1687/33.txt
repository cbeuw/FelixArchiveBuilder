A short, mostly wrong history of punk rock, part I
Felix Music’s resident punk rock addict gives the first instalment of a comprehensive history of the genre...
P
unk is hard to pin
down; it’s not a
particular genre
or style marked
by any particular techni-
cal approach to writing
music. In fact, most of
the time, it’s not very
technical at all. It’s sort of
a patched-together set of
reactions to a number of
musical lineages, which
entangled to form the
angry, thrasy, alive music
we know and love today.
One thing – there have
always been skinhead
punk movements, but I’m
not going into them here.
This isn’t what punk’s
about; in the immortal
words of the Dead
Kennedys, “Nazi punks
fuck off!” The punk I
know and love is fervently
anti-racist.
Ok, history. The very
first reaction was to 60s
and 70s rock. Country,
folk, and blues diverged in
the early 1900s US; blues
grew up in the Mississippi
delta, and moved north
to Chicago and Detroit,
where it became elec-
trified and gained wider
audiences. This was the
precursor of modern rock,
which evolved in the 40s
and 50s. Rock shared with
blues an affinity for the
same three chords (tonic,
subdominant, dominant,
or I-IV-V in various ar-
rangements). This sparse-
ness was integral to the
sound of the era; however,
as rock aged, it left these
behind. Gone were the
days of minimalism and
intimacy; the Guitar God
was born, and displays of
instrumental technicality
came to dominate the live
rock show.
This irritated the first
punks, who came from
the 60s garage-rock scene
and kept with them a DIY
ethos – bands like the
Kinks, the Seeds, and the
Sonics. Traditional punk
bands like the Clash grew
up in this era – tubthump-
ing mish-mashes of power
chords and energy.
In the US, experimental
post-psych acts like the
Velvet Underground and
the Stooges were defining
a sound of their own; a
wave of the sound hit New
York City in the early 70s,
including the Dictators,
the Modern Lovers, and
Willie Alexander and the
Boom Boom Band. These
guys were avant-garde,
experimental, and did not
give a shit about the estab-
lished tastes of the time.
Meanwhile, CBGB came
and became a happening
place – Blondie, the Cure,
the Talking Heads, and
so on. And in December
1969, a name was born:
“Whiny, adolescently
repulsive and barely dis-
They’re pretty well
known [citation needed].
Along the lines of pop
punk, the Ramones paved
the way; bands like the
Buzzcocks and the Under-
tones emerged, and had
a significant influence on
pop-punk and skate punk,
which arose – and will be
talked about – later.
And the evolution
continued; new wave
happened, with bands like
Ultravox, the Pretenders,
the Cars, Tubeway Army,
and CBGB acts like
the Talking Heads and
Blondie, which began
moving in a less abrasive
and more pop-friendly
direction. Descendents
include Morrissey, Duran
Duran, Interpol, the
National, the Strokes,
the Killers, Slowdive,
and Franz Ferdinand all
have a new-wavey, post-
punky heritage. These
guys played with poppier
sounds, synths, and a
range of emotion decided-
ly less than just screaming
into the mic.
On the other hand,
there was a movement to
make punk sound cold
and industrial. Post-punk
was a parallel movement,
featuring Joy Division,
the Fall, and the Rain-
coats. Modern derivatives
include Protomartyr and
New Order, which formed
from the remains of Joy
Division after Ian Curtis’s
unfortunate suicide.
These artists are known
for droning, plodding,
spacy soundscapes and
a brooding worldview.
Many of these bands hail
from the north of England,
or other post-industrial
areas (Protomartyr is from
Detroit, for example) – a
soundtrack to the desolate
metalscape.
The second wave of
ska was also brought
about by punks; bands
like the Specials, the Beat,
and Madness typified the
2-tone “mod” era, and
fed massively into the
rise of third wave in the
US (more later); their
music was marked by
a reggae-inspired sense
of rhythm and HORNS
EVERYWHERE. While
ska originated in Jamaica
alongside rocksteady and
reggae, it was precisely
this deterritorializing
(to quote Deleuze and
Guattari) adoption that
has sustained the genre.
The Specials are also
the origin of the cultural
touchstone that is Walt
Jabsco, a skanking man
(“skanking” refers to a
dance common at these
gigs; the term survives in
modern drum’n’bass).
For this installment,
I’ll close here, because
this underpins a point I’d
like to make: lots of punk
doesn’t sound like what
people think punk should
sound like. Punk is more
an ethos, an aesthetic, a
set of positions on reli-
gious wars endemic to the
music industry, where au-
thenticity, self-expression,
and music for music’s
sake take priority over any
other interest (be it corpo-
rate, Nazi, or The Man in
your favorite incarnation).
And that’s why punks get
so mad about ‘sellouts’:
do whatever you want,
just do it for yourself.
Stay tuned for Part 2:
hardcore, skate, thrash,
and the third and fourth
waves of ska.

The Velvet Underground & Nico, their debut // Verve
tinguishable street-punk
anthems” wrote John
Mendehlson of the Stoog-
es’s debut.
These two lines, post-
psych and garage-rock,
are the ultimate stylistic
source of punk, but punk
represents an ethos that
transcends any particular
sound. Punk is primarily
about community and
individuality. Authority is
scorned; individual, DIY
effort is encouraged, and
there is a great importance
to the notion of “authen-
ticity” – music, writing,
art made with no reserva-
tions or ulterior motives,
art made for art’s sake.
Anyways, CBGB, the
small Manhattan venue,
thrived. The Heartbreak-
ers, the Voidoids, and
the Dead Boys all came
through those doors, as
did hundreds, hundreds,
of other acts. Over its
30-something year run
open, CBGB became the
heart of US punk rock at
the time.
In the UK, a shop
named SEX hired some
people, gave them names
and trendy clothing, and
formed the Sex Pistols.
