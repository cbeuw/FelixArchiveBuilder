Voting Opens
Results Party
Voting opens at noon today in The Leadership Elections. You have until
noon, next Friday 9 March to decide your student leaders.
Vote now at imperialcollegeunion.org/vote
These elections touch every aspect of student life at Imperial - from
funding decisions, to extra-curricular programmes, to the menu in
Union bars, the roles have a big impact on the quality of your university
experience. We encourage you to have your say.
Our OfficerTrustees (Union President and four Deputies) also represent
the student body to College on a wide range of issues. The higher the
voter turnout, the bigger their mandate - making it easier for them to
influence decisions at the highest level.
After voting closes on Friday 9 March, everyone is invited to gather at Metric
for the exciting results announcement.
Come find out who your new student leaders are for the next academic
year, commiserate with those who were not successful, and celebrate our
democracy as a Union.
The Results Party starts at 19:00. Entry is free.
