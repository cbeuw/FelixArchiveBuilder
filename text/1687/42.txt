is the biggest
Kabaddi event of the year,
with universities nation-
wide coming to play and
watch. IC 1s have won
the tournament for the last
three years. Matches were
nine minutes long, and
there were two groups,
from which four teams
qualify for the semi-finals,
followed by the final.
1s take home the
crown
The IC 1s had a
comfortable group, their
first game against IC 3s.
The 1s annihilated their
own clubmates with a
29-2 victory. Building up
momentum, they sliced
through Manchester and
LSE 2s with relative ease.
The final group match
against the UoB 2s went
without incident, until one
of the defenders (Felix)
dashed out the raider,
accidentally hitting his
head on the face of the 1s
captain, Karmanya. Chaos
ensued as the paramedics
took him off the pitch.
However, so determined
was Karmanya to steer his
team to victory, he was
back on the pitch for the
semi-finals against LSE
1s. He led by example as
the IC 1s opened a lead
against their long-time
rivals (to whom they lost
at London Zone), claiming
a 12-8 victory.
A tight final was on the
cards. Previous winners,
the IC 1s, up against
previous Runners Up and
Central Zone winners,
UoB 1s. Game on. Raid
after raid. Aggressive de-
fending from both sides.
Hunger for points. Argu-
ments with the refs. The 1s
took the lead in the raiding
but a defensive surge from
the UoB side resulted in
a series of knock-outs
to the IC 1s side. The IC
defenders kept their poise,
however, and put in some
mesmerising tackles. The
team held strong for the
final minutes of the game.
The final whistle was
blown. The ref beckoned
the teams over. The score
– UoB 1s 15-19 IC 1s!
National Champions.
Fourth year running.
2s bow out in a great
final match
The IC 2s found them-
selves in decidedly the
more difficult of the two
groups, facing finalists
from previous years: LSE
1s, UoB 1s, and Kings.
The addition of Warwick
wasn’t ideal either – a side
known for their aggressive
defence.
The first game was
close: a slim loss to KCL.
Nonetheless, the 2s put
forward some stellar
Kabaddi. Put on the back
foot, KCL was saved by
the end of the short game.
The next game against
LSE saw the return of
bad habits from the ex-
perienced 2s team. These
impacts continued into the
next match against UoB,
despite the extra five
minutes allowed between
games for the ex-IC medic
referee to go and relocate
someone’s shoulder.
Three losses meant that
the 2s knew they weren’t
in the semis, so had
nothing to lose going into
their last match. Warwick
– a team with a highly
aggressive play-style.
The 2s’ composure shone
through: quintessential
clever Kabaddi, forcing
and exploiting the oppo-
nent’s errors. A spectacu-
lar win and a great way to
end the day for the IC 2s.
3s keep their spotless
reputation
The pressure was on
this year for the IC 3s.
With such high praise as
“literally the best 3rd team
in the UK Kabaddi scene”
resting on their shoulders,
following a stellar per-
formance last year, they
were looking to maintain
a spotless reputation in
2018.
They didn’t disappoint.
After an initial setback
with a ten-point loss to
wild card team Manches-
ter (who haven’t graced
the sport for three years…)
the 3s rallied to the inspir-
ing words of Neev “PBL”
Trehan. A good thing too.
Their next match was a
biggy: LSE 2s. Arch rivals
of IC Kabaddi. The fire in
the belly of this relative-
ly-inexperienced team
was fuelled, ploughing
through the LSE side to
an 18-14 victory! Their
final match was against
the Birmingham 2s but
what was shaping up to be
a nail-biting game ended
with a 14-15 loss.
So do the 3s of 2018
compare to those of 2017?
No. They’re leagues
ahead. IC Kabaddi asked
the same critic who gave
them such high praise last
year and he responded:
“I have never, in all my
years as a professional
Kabaddier, seen a 3s team
play like that. These guys
aren’t the best 3s team on
the UK Kabaddi scene;
they’re the best in the
world!”
Women’s team fight
through injuries
The Imperial women
had a tough fight going
in with a team riddled
with injuries and three
members playing for the
first time!
Game 1: KCL. The
tone was set for the tour-
nament – fast and aggres-
sive Kabaddi. IC started
the game with fantastic
tackles. Unfortunately, the
lead was lost at the end,
with KCL winning 15-17.
LSE 2s were next.
With the new IC members
gaining confidence, this
match saw some slick
raids and crunching
tackles. This was reflected
in the result – a 15-15
draw against the LSE
2s. The final was against
long-time rivals and the
team to beat – LSE 1s.
While IC raided hard and
tackled harder, the final
score stood at 9-18.
The heightened
standard of Kabaddi
shown by the women
was terrific. The women
will continue to train hard
in anticipation of their
rematch against LSE 1s
at the City Varsity. Watch
this space.
