From skin cells to stem cells?
S
tem cells are un-
specialised cells
that can develop to
form almost all cell
types in your body – just
like Mystique in X-men.
Similar to the movies,
this ‘shapeshifting’ ability
makes these types of cells
extremely valuable in
medicine. From gener-
ating new skin for burn
victims, to creating new
organs in the lab, these
cells undoubtedly have
the potential to improve
our quality of life.
Nevertheless, these
highly unspecialised
pluripotent embryonic
stem cells (ESC) only
reside in rare places
within the body, including
developing embryos. As
they are obtained from
embryos, this has raised a
number of ethical issues.
Thereby, a new method of
reprogramming special-
ised adult cells has been
developed: induced pluri-
potent stem cells (iPSC).
Imagine an egg. It has
the potential to become
a lot of things if you add
the right ingredients. For
instance, you can make
a delicious Victorian
sponge, or you can make
a piping hot omelette.
The Nobel-prize-worthy
question is: can you turn
the final product back to
its original ingredient?
Put the egg back into its
shell?
This answer is yes!
iPSCs are essentially the
successfully developed
this reprogramming
technology back in 2006.
However, this process
is extremely difficult,
and the efficiency of the
reprogramming process is
less than 1%. To put this
into context, according
to Amram Shapiro’s
book The Book of Odds,
there is a higher chance
of getting into Harvard
than successfully turning
a specialised cell into an
iPSC.
Such low efficiency
hinders the transferal
of this technology into
the clinic, so constant
efforts are being made
to improve the process.
Recently, a group led
by Ganna Bilousova,
Ph.D. in the University
of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus, US, has
uncovered a more efficient
way to create iPSCs from
skin cells.
By introducing a
cocktail of molecules that
control how genes turn
on and off (modified nu-
cleobases, supplemented
with ESC-specific mature
micro-RNA mimics), the
group has successfully
enhanced the efficiency
of the reprogramming
process.
Not only did they create
this unique mixture of
molecules, but they also
optimised the way these
molecules are introduced
into the skin cells. This
means that the adult cells
are more receptive to the
changes, and less likely
to die from the repro-
gramming process. Addi-
tionally, the cell growing
regime was fine-tuned
by having a low plating
density, thus cells are less
crowded and grow faster.
These changes allow a
maximum efficiency for
turning skin cells into
iPSCs.
By augmenting both
the culturing conditions
and the level of repro-
gramming molecules,
these modifications acted
synergistically to improve
the process. Upon inspec-
tion, the results of the
gene expression profile
hinted that other players,
such as SLLA4, may be
mediating the process of
reprogramming.
Altogether, this allows
an ultra-high efficient
system where both
diseased and healthy skin
cells can be turned into
iPSCs in a cheaper, faster,
and more reliable manner.
Nonetheless, this protocol
is cell-type specific,
meaning more work is
needed if we want to
use this technique in the
clinic or for treating other
diseases. So keep eating
your greens and head to
the gym – growing organs
in the lab is not quite here
yet!
Understanding apoptosis: the human suicide squad
A
re you aware
that human
cells also
have their
own version of a suicide
squad? This squad comes
into action in times of
extreme distress, when
cells have extinguished
all other means to combat
their stress. Their call to
action means only one
thing – destruction of
the cells themselves, and
everything inside which
can also pose a threat to
the rest of the body. While
you may consider this ul-
timate act of self-sacrifice
too extreme, this suicidal
death of a cell, also termed
‘Apoptosis’, is used to
keep life-threatening
dangers such as cancer in
check.
The latest findings
published last week
explained one of the less
understood steps of the
process of apoptosis: the
mechanism of the release
of the mitochondrial (MT)
genome inside the cell’s
cytoplasm. The integrity
of mitochondria serves as
a checkpoint for the cell to
decide if the circumstanc-
es are severe enough to
activate self-detonation. and cause the release of
mitochondrial DNA into
the cytoplasm, which
further signals the contin-
uation of apoptosis in the
cell. This latest study –
publishedbyajointcollab-
oration between Monash
University, Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute, and
Howard Hughes Medical
Institute – was able to
record the expulsion of
the mitochondrial genome
in real time. They used a
combination of multiple
microscopy techniques
to image cells at a very
high degree of resolution.
Their images confirmed
that BAK/BAX proteins
create large pores inside
the outer membrane of the
mitochondria. The inner
MT membrane pushes
out through these holes
to escape into cytoplasm
with all of its constituents.
This mechanism of action
is also called “mitochon-
drial hernia”.
The primary technol-
ogy which could make
this possible was lattice
light sheet microscopy.
This was developed by
Eric Betzig, winner of
the 2014 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. This tech-
nique improves the older
light sheet fluorescence
microscopy by increasing
image acquisition speed
and reducing phototoxici-
ty induced damage to the
cells. According to Betzig
himself, this technology
will have more impact
than his Nobel-winning
work on super-resolution
microscopy.
Both the results and
method of study will
impact future work. This
strategy of using multiple
microscopy techniques to
capture cellular activities
inside the living cells at
such high resolution will
improve our understand-
ing of internal function-
ing. Hopefully, these
advances will culminate
in practical applications
in fields of health and
medicine.
