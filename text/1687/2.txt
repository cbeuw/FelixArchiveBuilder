First five days of strikes end with Imperial calling for
review of UUK changes

Imperial shift position
as lecturers and
support staff walk
out for five days, with
strikes set to continue.

I
mperial College
London senior
management have
called on Univer-
sities UK to reevaluate
their proposed changes
to the Universities Su-
perannuation Scheme
(USS), amid concerns
over data and analysis.
In an email sent out
to staff on Tuesday af-
ternoon, Professor Alice
Gast, President, and
Professor James Stirling,
Provost, said the College
“are now calling upon
UUK and USS to jointly
convene an expert group,
including both their advis-
ers and leading academic
experts, to provide full
transparency” on UUK’s
proposals. It came four
days into industrial action
by the Universities and
College Union (UCU),
which could last up to 14
days.
A proposal by UUK,
the organisational body
for UK higher education
institutions, claimed the
current USS pension
was operating with a
deficit of £7.5bn, and the
employee contributions
had increased by more
than 50% since 2014.
This proposal has been
criticised by a number of
parties, however, includ-
ing an Imperial working
group, who said a “lack
of transparency remains
a key issue” in the debate.
College has committed
to “fully resource any
staff” who participate
in the evaluation of the
proposals. In a statement
for Felix, a College rep-
resentative said: “recog-
nising that this work may
take time and go beyond
the statutory deadline for
changes to be introduced,
and if asked to do so, the
College has pledged to
carry its share of the risk
of staying on the current
scheme while this work is
completed.”
This week saw the
completion of the first
five days of strike action,
with a number of Imperial
staff and students braving
the cold weather to stand
on picket lines. The fifth
day of action ended with
a demonstration in central
London, joined by Imperi-
al staff and students. Last
Tuesday, UUK and UCU
announced a joint arbitra-
tion attempt throughAcas,
an industrial conciliation
service. Talks are sched-
uled to begin on Monday
5th
March.
think it would be foolish
for anyone to predict the
outcome of the analysis,
so let’s do it, and then
work out what the best
way forward is.”
Rhidian Thomas,
Imperial College Union’s
Ethics and Environment
Officer, who has been sup-
porting staff on the picket
line, told Felix: “For too
long, we’ve accepted the
marketisation of higher
education as inevitable.
It’s not just students
paying fees who are suf-
fering as a consequence
– we’re now seeing staff’s
pensions being gambled
on the stock market. In
the context of skyrocket-
ing fees, higher student
numbers and rampant
executive pay rises, it’s
unacceptable that ordi-
nary staff are expected to
bear the cost. As students
of Imperial College, we
ought to be calling on
our senior management
to defend their staff and
lobby UUK to ditch the
proposed pension changes
once and for all.”
UCU representatives
welcomed the news. Dr
Michael McGarvey, pres-
ident of Imperial UCU,
told Felix: “During the
second week of the strike
our members at Imperial
have continued their
tremendous support and
this has been mirrored at
universities throughout
the country. We have also
been heartened by the
great support that we have
received from our stu-
dents with many joining
us at the picket lines every
day.”
“The Imperial UCU
membership continues to
rise at an unprecedented
rate as more and more
people realise the enor-
mity of how damaging
these pension proposals
are, and is now up by
more than 25% since the
dispute started. Many
have joined the union
specifically to support
the action, and up to a
hundred of our members
have joined picket lines.“
“On Tuesday the Pres-
ident announced a huge
shift in the position of the
senior management at Im-
perial, altering their hard-
line stance in supporting
the implementation of the
very detrimental changes
to staff pensions. It shows
that the senior manage-
ment are at last beginning
to grasp the level of
outrage among staff at
have averted the strike.
“It is up to UUK to get
to grips with the reality
of the situation and come
to a fair and acceptable
settlement. Until then our
strike will continue.”
The development
came after more than 60
universities were affected
by industrial action, with
tutorials and lectures can-
celled. UCU have tabled a
set of proposals, including
provision of a guaranteed
pension for members and
universities accepting a
small amount of increased
risk.
UCU general secretary
Sally Hunt said: “We are
pleased the employers
have agreed to more
talks… We have listened
not just to our members,
but also to the many uni-
versity leaders who have
contributed ideas.”
A number of university
leaders had called on
UUK to reopen talks with
UCU, in an effort to limit
the likelihood of further
industrial action.

“In an email,
Alice Gast said

'are now
calling on UUK
to convene an
expert group'”
Speaking to Professor
Stirling at the picket line
earlier this week, he told
Felix the developments
over talks were “posi-
tive”: “UUK and UCU
are getting Acas involved
and getting back around
the table. I think this is a
really positive develop-
ment, so I am hopeful that
we will be able to reach an
agreement on this, and a
good way forward for our
staff.”
He went on to say: “I

do this from the outset? If
they had used their influ-

Elections are upon us
S
o, we’ve made it.
As my Facebook
timehop helpful-
ly reminded me
the other day, it has been
a full year since I start-
ed plastering my face
around campus in an
effort to have the chance
to plaster this paper
around campus instead.
I can’t say I look back
on those two weeks of
electioneering fondly; in
fact, they were probably
two of the most stressful
weeks I’ve experienced
since coming to univer-
sity. This year things
are probably going to
be even more intense,
since the two weeks of
campaigning and voting
are going to be crammed
into one. If there are any
lectures not being can-
celled by the strikes next
week, I’m sure they’ll be
taken up by innumerable
awful shout-outs, so
look forward to that.
As for me, I’m nearly
free! This time next week
voting will have closed,
and we should be about to
find out who next year’s
sabbatical team are. For
whoever succeeds me as
Felix Editor, I wish them
the best of luck, and pray
their neurotic tendencies
are less pronounced than
mine… The next week
is a difficult time for the
current sabbatical officers;
we’re going to spend most
of the week listening to
our potential successors
point out all the things
that haven’t done, and
promise to do a better job
than we have. Ouch. I get
why it has to be done, but
it ain’t going to feel good.
But it is something the
sabbatical team need to
hear, myself included.
Many people run, not out
of some desire for change,
or to do good (although
those do come into play),
but more out of frustration
at how things have been
going so far. I don’t think
anybody puts themselves
forward because they’re
happy with the status quo:
you nominate yourself
because you have opin-
ions on what hasn’t been
delivered, and you have
ideas about how to deliver
them – whether that’s
improving the counselling
service, bringing back
SCR breakfasts, or just
trying to make Imperial a
friendlier place to be.
For all those running, I
ask one thing: this week
might go by in a blur, but
never forget that feeling
of anger or frustration that
made you run in the first
place. The Buddha might
have said holding onto
anger is like holding onto
a hot coal, but perhaps in
this current weather that’s
exactly what is required.
Plus I don’t think the
Buddha ever had to deal
with the Fusion price
increase, so I’d take the
advice with a pinch of
salt.
The sabbatical roles
aren’t ones you can
do adequately without
at least a modicum of
passion for the job; after
all, many of you could
probably be earning quite
a bit more working for a
large faceless corporation,
so the decision to work for
not quite as much, in a not
quite as large, not quite
as faceless charity must
mean it’s something you
take an interest in. Hold
on to that passion; don’t
let it be extinguished when
you get into your role, but
instead use it to push for
change, and achieve all
the things you don’t think
we’ve done.
So if you’re running
make sure you don’t pull
any punches; shout loud
and clear about what you
want to do, and make sure
you go ahead and do it.
And this goes for Felix.
Just don’t be mean about
my editorials. Please.
