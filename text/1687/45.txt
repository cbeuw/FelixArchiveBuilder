T
he Royal School
of Mines made
the long sev-
en-hour journey
down to Newquay for the
116th
Bottle Match against
Camborne School of
Mines. Although the jour-
ney was long, it was made
somewhat more enjoyable
by the numerous games of
chase the ace played. The
memory of the loss two
years ago and lodge 15
antics was a huge motiva-
tion for the boys and we
felt confident going into
the game following last
year’s comfortable win
over CSM.
Unlike the mud bath
two years ago, the pitch
was dry and well suited to
the free-flowing game of
the RSM; following a near
perfect warm up the boys
were ready for what was
undoubtedly one of the
most important games of
the year. The start of the
match saw RSM receive
the kick-off and, follow-
ing a poor exit, CSM
went over the line within
the first few minutes.
The worst possible start.
This was compounded by
the loss of RSM stalwart
Ruairi Dunne to a broken
hand. The RSM did
however fight back with
strong phase play leading
to a number of penalties.
This drove RSM deep
into CSM territory, where
we got our just reward
with Harry Allingham
being bundled over for a
try from a driving maul
to take the score to 5-5.
“Unlike the

RSM continued mounting
pressure and Allingham
should have had a second
from a driving maul, had
it not been held up. Even-
tually CSM turned over
the ball and momentum
shifted to them. Numerous
line breaks, in particular
from the CSM number 8,
took them into the RSM
twenty-two; although
the defence was strong,
particularly from the likes
of Will Aynsley, Martin
Head, and Nathan Tom-
linson, CSM managed
to score again to take the
score to 12-5 following
a couple of disallowed
tries, much to the credit
of the RSM defence. A
late penalty from CSM
meant the half-time score
was 15-5. A particular
highlight from the first
half was Alex Amato
‘gerrarding’ the ball into
the CSM crowd – shame
it missed them all.
RSM came out in the
second half still confident
of turning around the
deficit. However another
poor start led to an early
second half try from CSM
taking their lead out to
22-5. RSM knew they had
to score next to get back
in the game. The next part
of the match saw RSM
play some quality rugby.
Amin Omarouayache,
RSM could well have
scored and found them-
selves back in the game.
This didn’t, however,
damp the RSM spirits and
more quality hands led
to more chances, but as
has been seen throughout
the season, the chances
couldn’t be converted into
points. As time began to
run out, CSM regained
the ball and took their
chances. Two tries and a
penalty in the last twenty
minutes put the game
to bed with a final score
of 35-5, making it two
unsuccessful away trips to
Cornwall in a row.
Although the bottle had
been lost, it was not going
to stop the RSM boys from
having a quality afternoon
and evening. The festivi-
ties went on well into the
early hours of the morning
and were finished off with
numerous grecs.

Strong carrying from the
RSM forwards sucked in
CSM defence and created
space out wide. Soft hands
from the likes of James
Field, Colonel Nick UA
