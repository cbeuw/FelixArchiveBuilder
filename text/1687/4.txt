T
his year’s Varsi-
tyFest has been
postponed, fol-
lowing heavy
snow and cold weather.
In an update, Imperial
College Union (ICU) told
students: “Due to adverse
weather VarsityFest from
this Saturday 3 March is
postponed.” Club captains
are scheduled to receive
emails about contingency
plans, and students are
advised to check for
updates in the coming
days. ICU has posted pho-
tographs of Heston Sports
Ground buried under a
VarsityFest delayed due to poor weather
thick blanket of snow. Or-
ganisers have given club
captains three options for
a new date, and the choice
will be communicated to
students in the near future.
The move follows
the cancellation of this
week’s Hockey Varsity,
which was scheduled to
be played on Wednesday
afternoon. In a statement,
Sport Imperial said “Har-
lington is now under a
thick layer of snow and
frozen over”, and it would
send an update later in the
week on when the match
would be rescheduled.
Tickets for VarsityFest
should still be accepted for
the rescheduled date, but
students who cannot make
it will be provided with a
refund. Information about
the process for refunds
will be sent out once the
date has been rearranged.
In a statement, an
ICU representative said:
“Due to adverse weather
conditions which are not
scheduled to change over
the weekend, Sport Impe-
rial and Imperial College
Union took the decision
today to postpone the
annual VarsityFest
competition. We plan to
re-arrange the event at a
different time. We are dis-
appointed that the weather
has impacted the event
as such, but the main
concern was the playing
conditions at the grounds
and at this moment it is
not safe to play sport on
frozen ground.”
VarsityFest 2018 was
scheduled to take place
this Saturday, 3rd March.
This year the Headline
match will be the Netball
1s, and the Showcase
match will be Kabaddi.
The majority of the
matches were scheduled
to be played outside.
The current weather
has caused havoc across
the country, as strong
winds, low temperatures,
and heavy snow affected
transport links. Hundreds
of flights have been can-
celled, and the Met Office
has issued a red extreme
weather warning for snow
and wind in southwest
England. It said: “Long
interruptions to power
supplies and other utilities
are very likely to occur,
along with damage to trees
and other structures due to
heavy snow or ice.” The
extreme weather has been
prompted by icy Siberian
air – dubbed “the beast
from the east” – which has
engulfed the country.

Senior management
confirmed students
would "not be
examined on any
material that you
have not been taught"

I
mperial College
London has con-
firmed students will
not be examined
on material missed as
a result of the ongoing
strikes by the Univer-
sity and College Union
(UCU).
In an email sent to all
students last Friday, 23rd
February, Professor James
Stirling, the Provost, and
Professor Simone Bui-
tendijk, Vice-Provost (Ed-
ucation), said they wanted
to “reassure [students]
that no students will be
placed at a disadvantage
due to the strike”. They
told students: “We can
say with certainty that you
will not be examined on
any material that you have
not been taught.”
I
mperial’s Centre for
Neuropsychophar-
macology is partly
funded by a family
trust owned by former
Formula One boss Max
Mosley.
Max Mosley-owned trust funding Imperial lab
The Alexander Mosley
Charitable Trust was set
up in memory of Mos-
ley’s son, who died of a
suspected drug overdose
in 2009. Since then, the
trust has donated at least
£600,000 to the centre,
which is headed by
Professor David Nutt.
Professor Nutt’s recent
work has looked at the
potential therapeutic ben-
efits of psychedelic drugs
in treating depression.
The trust has also
provided funding to Dr.
Ben Sessa, a psychiatrist
researching the use of
MDMA as a treatment for
PTSD. Dr. Sessa was due
to speak about his work
yesterday at an event
hosted by Imperial’s Psy-
chedelic Studies society,
which was cancelled
because of poor weather.
The trust has given
more than £1 million to St
Peter’s College, Oxford,
where Alexander Mosley
studied. The deputy leader
of the Labour Party, Tom
Watson, has also accepted
donations totalling more
than £500,000 from the
trust. Watson is also in
charge of Labour’s poli-
cies on press regulation.
Mosley bankrolls the
state-recognised press
regulator Impress via the
trust. Only a few small
publications and websites
have signed up to Impress;
the majority of national
and local publications
are members of the Inde-
pendent Press Standards
Organisation (Ipso).
Mosley’s interest in
press regulation stems
from his successful legal
battle against News of
the World in 2008. The
trial centred on a News
of the World story about
Mosley’s sadomasochistic
involvement with five
prostitutes, but Mosley
was also questioned
on election literature
published for the British
Union of Fascists, which
was led by Mosley’s
father, Sir Oswald Mosley.
During the trial Mosley
claimed to have no rec-
ollection of publishing
campaign leaflets calling
for black people to be
deported and accusing
immigrants of carrying
diseases such as leprosy,
syphilis, and TB. A copy
of one of the leaflets carry-
ing the words “published
by Max Mosley” emerged
earlier this week. Mosley
continued to deny his
involvement in the 1961
by-election campaign in
an interview with Channel
4 News’ Cathy Newman.
Police are now assessing
evidence relating to a
possible charge of perjury
against Mosley.
The College has not
commented.
The email came two
days into the strikes,
which could last up to
14 days. UCU members
voted to take industrial
action following proposed
changes to their pension
scheme by Universities
UK (UUK).
The email was fol-
lowed by another message
from Professor Buitendijk
on Thursday, 1st
March
saying: “Every effort is
being made to ensure
that the overall goals of
each module and degree
programme are achieved.
For Imperial modules and
where the College has
final authority, I can reit-
erate my assurances you
will not be assessed on
anything that has not been
taught to you as a result of
strike action.”
A number of students
and staff have voiced con-
cerns over whether or not
assessments later this year
would include material
scheduled to be covered in
contact time cancelled due
to the strike. In an email
sent to Prof. Stirling and
Prof. Buitendijk earlier on
Friday, Professor Michele
Dougherty, head of the
Department of Physics,
expressed her worries
over “uncertainty and lack
of clarity from College”,
and asked the College to
“show sector leadership
on this matter”.
One issue Prof.
Dougherty highlighted
was the expectation of
departmental staff to min-
imise the impact the strike
was having on students,
which she said was “un-
reasonable and unviable”.
Last week, over 700
students from the Depart-
ment of Physics alone
were affected, as nearly
60% of lecture contact
hours and nearly 40%
of tutorial contact hours
had to be cancelled. Prof.
Dougherty urged the
College to “ensure that
productive negotiations
are reopened between
UUK and the [UCU]
without any further
delay”.
In a statement for Felix,
a Union representative
said: “The Union is glad
to see the College is
addressing the concerns
we have raised on behalf
of our members regarding
the impact of the current
strikes. This is testament
to the work of staff and
student representatives
across the College. We
hope the College consid-
ers the other impacts of
these strikes and takes
action – urging UUK
reopen negotiations
between UUK and UCU.”
As well as concerns
over examinations, a
number of student ac-
ademic representatives
have been asking whether
tuition fees would be
refunded as a result of the
strike action. A petition
requesting a partial refund
of tuition fees, started by
students in the Electronic
and Electrical Engineer-
ing (EEE) Department,
currently has around
2,500 signatures. Students
at other universities have
started similar petitions,
with reports of the number
of students demanding
refunds increasing by
10,000 per day.
In the email, Prof. Stir-
ling and Prof. Buitendijk
said: “We have also heard
from a number of students
about their tuition fees
and we will address this
concern in due course.”
UCU is currently
taking industrial action
over changes to pension
schemes, which it says
could see academics and
support staff losing out on
thousands of pounds each
year. Universities UK, the
governing body propos-
ing the changes, says the
move is needed to ensure
the sustainability of the
scheme – a proposal UCU
disagrees with.
