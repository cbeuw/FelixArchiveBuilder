Imperial College Union is ineffective,
it has become rigid and bureaucratic.
Change is nigh impossible and the union
feels unaccountable and opaque. Along
with this there are serious failures to
address issues of importance: There is no
substantial campaign on the hefty food
prices on campus. Prices have increased
substantially over Christmas leading
food on campus to be a no option for
lots of students. For example lunch at
the sandwich shop in the JCR could cost
you upwards of £6, and that’s AFTER they
have removed VAT. * The ICU ticketing
system is unfit for purpose. More tickets
than are available are regularly sold; in
one ticket sale this year the union website
crashed a full ten minutes BEFORE the
sale. Constituent Unions and DepSocs
have resorted to using EventBrite to
sell place-holder tickets. * Societies
running events which consume large
amounts of their budgets for a minority
of members is unacceptable. Examples
include spending an obscene proportion
of budget on an event available to 2% of
members (Including committee). Our
union needs a change of leadership
to clear the air and renew its focus. As
your president I will: * Lobby College
heavily on food prices, the current
situation is unacceptable. * Deliver on
a new ticketing system with up-most
priority. * Introduce new union policy to
introduce a restriction on proportion of
budget spent on a single guest per event.
Further restricting artificially inflating
membership by advertising large society
events to non members. Vote for a new
union, vote @Kyle Condon.
