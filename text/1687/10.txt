accounts. Beginning with
the last point, for the 20%
of the world’s population
residing in China, Turkey,
Iran or the UAE, places
where arguably VPNs
are really needed, these
services and even the
Apple App store itself are
barred. On the second, it
buries the switch which
determines whether your
server is routed to their
servers or not deep in the
user interface making it
cumbersome to chance
those galoshes. On the
first point… don’t even
get me started!
If you scroll down
beyond the candy
wrapping, to the para-
graph on “how it works”
you find out that your
questionable activities are
“used to gain insights into
the products and services
people value”. They spell
thisoutalittlemoreclearly
in their Privacy policy,
writing “we may share (or
receive) information, in-
cluding personally-iden-
tifying information with
(or from) our Affiliates”
[i.e. Facebook] and “assist
law enforcement when
we have good-faith belief
that such cooperation is
reasonably necessary”. To
put this in practical terms
for those of you who need
it, if you are hoping to
keep your romp through
the deep web a secret,
Onavo could bring some
interesting advertising on
Facebook. And if you are
journalist, watchdog or a
lawyer dealing with sensi-
tive information, that app
you probably would never
notice could compromise
your work.
If it is some small
comfort, Android users
may be flattered that they
were first to get asked for
their participation in this
bizarre scheme and have
been prompted since 2016
to support Facebook’s
efforts to capture all parts
of your digital life.
Mark Zuckerberg’s has
resolved in 2018 to make
“sure that time spent on
Facebook is well spent”
acknowledged “the rise of
a small number of big tech
companies — and govern-
ments using technology
to watch their citizens”.
Facebook Protect has,
in its own small way,
worsened this problem
of the centralization of
knowledge – and with
it, power. But there is
time yet for to change
the world’s largest social
network for better.
Why Facebook “Protect” is all but protection

T
his week,
WIRED reports
that Facebook
has been trialling
a new feature for the iOS
Facebook app, called
“Protect”. The little blue
shield directs you to the
App Store where you will
be prompted to download
“Onavo Protect”, an
app Facebook bought
in 2013. This supposed
safety-enhancing app is
a VPN – a service which
encrypts mobile data and
sends it via their servers.
It also warns you if you
visit malicious websites
and can protect your login
details when connecting
on public networks. What
is not clear is why this is
of any use while using
Facebook’s own app – is
Facebook going to warn
us if their site starts
hosting malware? Do they
not already encrypt login
details when we use the
website?
The three top reasons
you’d turn to a VPN is a)
if you you’d temporarily
prefer authorities not like
to know about your exact
cybernetic ramblings,
b) if you’d like to safely
express yourself wearing
a different set of digital
galoshes or c) you would
like to access something
which is not available in
less liberal countries.
