ollowing a glo-
rious victory of
8-1 over CSM at
last year’s bottle
match, a fresh rendition
of the RSM badminton
team was construed with
Vimbai returning to take
the helm. As the RSM
team warmed up, the
entrance of the CSM team
and their respective warm
up procedures struck an
unprecedented fear at the
hearts of RSM: it would
so happen that the ‘true’
CSM badminton team did
not venture to London the
previous year, and hence
the 1-8 loss of CSM was
effectively a forfeit, with
the CSM lacrosse team the
substituted victims. This
year, the players put forth
by the CSM side were
highly skilled and pos-
sessed flawless technique
(albeit their questionable
sportsmanship in playing
four men and two women
in violation of the stipulat-
ed rules of an equal mix,
in addition to a few mem-
bers not even being part of
CSM, hailing instead from
the foreign departments of
English and Media), heav-
ily punishing the weaker
abilities of the RSM side.
As quickly as the impres-
sions of an easy victory
were shattered, they were
replaced with the good
spirits and sportsmanship
of the RSM side, who
persevered against the
unstoppable force of the
CSM team, clutching
points where possible.
The players had to adapt
their game to the signifi-
cantly higher level faced,
with more power required
to return the oppositions’
shots, and increased at-
tention to placement as to
not allow the opposition
to capitalise on weak
clears and high drops
shots. So intense was
the competition, that in
the first game, Vimbai’s
strings were sacrificed in
order for RSM to attain a
hard-fought second point.
Her backup racket left her
at a severe disadvantage
for her and Mustafa’s
remaining games, but they
persisted nonetheless.
The other two pairs were
constituted of Humzah
and Annie, and Haris
and Evelyn respectively,
who all stepped up their
game to the competition
and played excellently.
Although the trophy was
lost, with the final score
9-0 to CSM, all of the
players thoroughly en-
joyed the experience and
a high level of badminton
was displayed for both
the RSM team to improve
and spectators to enjoy;
leaving all the more moti-
vation to win it back next
year (if CSM bothers to
send their actual team).
A
fter a 7am
start, a long
journey down
to Cornwall,
and a tense football game,
RSM Netball were ready
to take on their CSM
counterparts. An indoor
court was more than
welcome against the cold
Cornish weather but it
meant contending with
some very loud support-
ers. RSM won the coin
toss and Laura kicked off
the match with the first
centre pass. However,
the CSM support proved
to be just as intimidating
as their shooters and we
finished the first quarter
with a disheartening 10-0
score line.
The late arrival of
Charlotte, our goal
keeper, straight from her
final exams, along with
some extra supporters
(and our trusty RSM
Netball flag) did wonders
to boost our moral. We
got back on court for the
start of the second quarter
with our heads held high.
that streak going. Before
CSM knew it, we stepped
up our game and fought
back their advances with
incredible finesse. This
time the CSM support had
nothing on our own - and
we definitely gave them
something to cheer about.
The score in the second
quarter was a thrilling 7-7,
bringing the score at half
time to 17-7.
In the third and fourth
quarters, we recognised
that we had lost the
element of surprise.
Although the RSM team
fought valiantly, CSM
remained the victors of
the Bottle Match and the
Netball win eluded us for
one more year. However,
with a score of 31-14,
it is exciting to mention
that this is the closest
RSM Netball has come to
winning the Bottle Match
so far. Year on year we
continue to narrow down
that goal difference. The
improvement just goes
to show how the team
is developing and, who
knows? Maybe next year
is the year that RSM
Netball will be crowned
champions of the Netball
Bottle Match!

ith rumours
of an in-
jured Rugby
team, and
with a series of well-
fought but unfortunate
losses, the pressure
was put onto the RSM
Lacrosse team to bring
back a win for the Royal
School of Mines in Bottle
Match 2018. Our Bottle
Match debut last year saw
us win 10-3 at home, but
now that we were away,
surely a bigger challenge
awaited us!
After seeing off the
heart-pounding draw
of the Men’s Hockey,
the entire squad com-
mandeered a coach and
immediately set off from
Penzance to Penryn.
Arriving to the pitch
with about 30 minutes to
warm up did not deter our
spirits. We got straight
into our warm-up and
straight into setting up
the goal we brought over
from London!
With goals from
Arianna Guppy, Charlotte
Morphet, and Charlotte
Hampson, we quickly
found ourselves at the
end of the first quarter
4-1 up, with the crowd
going wild. Going into the
second quarter the game
became much scrappier,
and the conditions of the
pitch did not help with
the ground balls – in fact
we saw more grounded
players then picked up
ground balls. Fresher
Stephen Kwong found
himself bagging a goal
after winning a ground
ball and rolling through
CSM defences.
With two quarters re-
maining, CSM stepped up
their play (and fouls) and
scored at the start of the
third quarter. The CSM
spectators went crazy as
the idea of a comeback
swept through their minds.
After all, no Lacrosse
match is decided until
the final whistle, right?
In response to the CSM
cheers, Ari once again
won the draw and scored
once again bringing the
score to 7-2, silencing the
CSM chants, and igniting
once again the spirits of
the RSM!
Entering the final
quarter, with a 7-2 lead,
the Royal Miners of
Lacrosse went all out
with goals left, right,
and centre bringing the
final score to 13-3. The
Hero and Legend of
this amazing match was
Arianna Guppy, for her
overall dominance of
the game. Stephen “The
Mighty Kwong” Kwong
had also received nomi-
nations for his goal, and
Lygon Bowen-West was
an unsung hero for his
fantastic saves during the
game and general shutting
out of most goals from the
CSM’s attack.
We can’t wait for the
growth of the club over the
next year and of course,
our third Bottle Match
appearance, next year, at
home in Harlington!

CSM rally means RSM football’s drought continues
A
fter last
year’s result
at Harlington
(1-1, first goal
in 6 years), the team was
looking to build on that
performance and bring
home the first RSM victo-
ry since 2005. RSMAFC
went down to Cornwall
undefeated in 7 games
with their strongest squad
in recent memory.
In sunny but cold con-
ditions on the infamously
boggy Dracaena Centre
pitch, CSM kicked the
game off a little cautious-
ly. With the pitch immedi-
ately proving the biggest
problem for both teams
it was clear the game
could only be played
in one way: the surface
being too uneven to play
any building football,
RSMAFC decided to
pack the middle with a
diamond playing two
up front. This worked to
their advantage as they
started strongly setting
up camp in the opposition
half. The early pressure
told as RSM centre back
Sam Mitchell sent a
header cashing against the
crossbar. CSM’s tentative
start continued as they
gave away sloppy fouls
and RSM kept on pilling
on the pressure from
set pieces. Corner after
corner, free kick after free
kick, RSM wasted clear
opportunities to take the
lead – missed chances
they would come to rue.
On the 35 min mark CSM
went long from a free kick
within their own half. A
lapse in concentration
from RSM centre back
George Decaudaveine left
the CSM striker straight
through on goal to calmly
poke past the keeper. 1-0
CSM completely against
the run of play, but RSM
heads didn’t drop deter-
mined to fight back. The
goal proving to be just a
blip, RSM continued to
play with high intensity,
winning most duels and
penning CSM back into
their half. It was just
before the half-time
whistle that RSM reaped
the rewards for their
determined play. A free
kick from George Decau-
daveine was whipped into
the second post, missing
everyone in the box to
nestle just inside the side
netting. RSM were right
back in it and went into
halftime hungry to get the
win.
The match being very
much a game of two half
halves, CSM came out
for the second half on the
better side of pitch and
the better team. The pitch
really told in the second
half as RSM started to
come out second best on
the duels and this translat-
ed on pitch to CSM dom-
inating the second half.
A miscommunication at
the back and fluky header
later they were 3-1 up and
kept the trophy. RSMAFC
remain on the hunt to end
the 13 year drought.
