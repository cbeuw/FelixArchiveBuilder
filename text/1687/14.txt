Willis’ macabre and amusing science fiction classic
H
ow might one
interact with
people from the
distant past if
one were allowed to time
travel there?
This was the question
posed by Connie Willis in
her science fiction novel,
The Doomsday Book. The
novel is set in Oxford
University, at around
Christmas time, 2053.
A young woman called
Kivrin, a historian, is sent
back in time to research
the past.
Concerned about the
dangers of travelling back
to such an unfamiliar time,
a critical professor warns
her of all the possible
dangers she will face –
diseases, poor sanitation,
rape, being burned as a
witch… Yet all of those
worries prove to be su-
perficial when they realize
they made a mistake, and
she has actually landed in
the year the Black Death
reached Oxford, in the
Christmas of 1348! Mean-
while, a mysterious strain
of influenza is spreading
quickly back in the Oxford
of her time, and in the
ensuing panic, it becomes
uncertain whether anyone
will be able to arrange her
rescue.
The best part of the
novel is the chapters
concerning Kivrin’s
encounters with people
from 1348, which seemed
so real that I began to feel
attached to the characters
and their village. All of
this is brought to a dev-
astating end when, one
by one, they began to fall
victim to the plague.
Meanwhile back at
Oxford, people react
crazily to the influenza
outbreak, as they try to
make sense of it in hilar-
ious ways – much like
what Kivrin is seeing a
few centuries back.
Funny characters add
to the panic and confu-
sion. Amongst them are
Mrs Gaddson, an overly
concerned mother of a
student at the university,
who constantly complains
of poor living conditions,
and how it must have an
adverse effect on her son.
Later on, she takes to
reading passages about
doom and plague from the
Bible to influenza victims.
Although she was enter-
taining at the start, she
became background noise
at the end when the author
did not allow any more
developments on her part.
Another amusing char-
acter is Colin, the young
nephew of one of the
doctors. He walks around
disregarding all health
regulations and ignores
common hygiene practic-
es, and treats the influenza
outbreak as some kind
of huge adventure. Sur-
prisingly, his personality
proves to be useful when
he is sent on a mission by
the staff.
Nonetheless, there
are several aspects of
the novel which could
be improved. I found
the pretext for time
travelling unconvincing.
Why would anyone be
sent back towards such
a dangerous time when
it is possible to send a
machine back instead? Or
just consult contemporary
sources? After all, a
monk who had apparently
written it all down after
everyone else died was
constantly referred to by
the characters. There are
also some minor factual
inaccuracies, which
lessen the book.
The length of the book
might be shortened,
whilst still delivering the
main points, as repeti-
tiveness is a major issue
in the strange influenza
epidemic chapters. None-
theless, the book is still
worth reading for Kivrin’s
interactions with a set of
memorable medieval
characters.
