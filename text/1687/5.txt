S
ince it was re-
cently Valentines
Day, and my lack
of organisation
meant that I didn’t get this
into the paper in time for
a couple of weeks ago, I
thought I’d share some
ideas for those of you
looking to spice up your
next Valentine’s Day. Just
as with all sexual activity,
consent from the partici-
pating/affected parties is
key.
Restrain and suspend
yourself
You will need:
• Ropes
• Sleepsack, or
failing that, a cheap
sleeping bag (optional)
• A sturdy frame or
bar which can support the
weight of a person
Sometimes it can be
really fun to be fully
restrained so you can’t
move and be suspended
from the ceiling. If you
get yourself a nice sturdy
sleep-sack it should have
straps to keep you in
place. You can then attach
a rope and have someone
winch you up. Once
you’re there you’ll be
completely at their mercy.
So they can play with your
genitals or hit you with
something, or you can
just enjoy the sensation
of not being able to move.
If you’d like to get a little
more skillful and artistic
with your suspension, or
can’t afford a sleepsack,
try checking out shibari.
It’s the ancient japanese
art of rope bondage. You
can be suspended in all
kinds of shapes, or just do
away with the suspension
altogether and be turned
into a nice sculpture.

Watersports
You will need:
• Lots of water or
other beverages
• A bath, shower,
basement level l a b o r a -
tory bathroom, outside
space or a lack of respect
for your bedroom furnish-
ings. Take your pick.
This one is relatively
cheap and simple. Drink
lots of fluids, then pee
on your partner. It’s a
relatively risk free sexual
practice. Urine is usually
sterile, unless the urinator
has a UTI. There is a
tiny risk of salmonella or
CMV, but this is very rare.
Try not to get too much of
it in the eyes if you don’t
want a bit of stingage

lagnia
Be a dog person
Optional:
• Pup tail/ tail butt-
plug
• Pup hood or mask
Pup play is a rising
phenomenon in the kink
world. No equipment is
required, but can help
people to get into the
mood. Essentially, you
just have to get on your
hands and knees and
pretend to be a dog. You
could play fetch, eat from
a dog bowl or just do away
with human language
constructs and opt to
bark and growl instead.
Popping in a tail butt plug,
or strapping on a show tail
may make the experience
more dog-like. If you’re
really looking to go for it,
why not invest in an ana-
tomically correct canine
may have a willing sexual
partner just at the end of
your bed, or buried away
in a wardrobe. Just find
yourself a fit plushie.
Many people choose to
just hump against them,
or give them a facial. If
you’d like to go further,
and have sewing skills or
an open minded friend at
build a bear, you can even
sew in a silk orifice, or
pull out some stuffing and
fit an artificial silicone
one. If you are looking to
be penetrated, you can fit
a strap-on and go to town
on that teddy.

Sacrifice yourself as
food
Optional:
• Creature with a
jaw diameter wider than
your hips
• Craigslist ad
Can you imagine a
better feeling than being
swallowed and digested?
Me neither. Maybe you
could find yourself a large
snake and just let them
consume you. If being
swallowed whole isn’t the
deal breaker, you could
even organise to meet
someone online, who
might eat you in smaller
chunks.

I hope I’ve given you
some ideas, or enlight-
ened you somewhat.
Don’t forget to google
the keywords if you’re
interested. There’s a vast
wealth of advice and com-
munity out there. Happy
Next Valentine’s Day!
Yeah, not this kind of watersport… //Flickr

In The Whites…
Imperial College Musical Theatre Society’s latest production features a predominantly
white cast pretending to be Latino in a musical intended to promote representation of this
marginalised community.

A
cting is about
inhabiting an-
other person’s
life. When
stories explore univer-
sal themes – most of
Shakespeare fits this cate-
gory – few would disagree
that an actor can give an
insightful performance in
these stories, regardless of
their ethnic background.
The appeal of “colour
blind” casting, however,
collapses entirely when
telling the stories of mar-
ginalised groups.
Lin-Manuel Miranda’s
In The Heights follows
the routines, dreams, and
struggles of the mostly
Latino inhabitants of
Washington Heights,
Manhattan. Far from the
uneducated, sexualised
thugs Latino actors are
often forced to play,
these characters are fully
realised characters written
by a man who shares their
background. Miranda
has used In The Heights
and Hamilton (which
very deliberately casts
non-white actors as Amer-
ica’s founding fathers) to
empower actors who too
rarely get the opportunity
to inhabit three-dimen-
sional characters with
their own stories to tell.
In MTSoc’s produc-
tion of In The Heights,
however, the majority of
roles are played by white
actors. This includes
Benny, a young black
driver whose love inter-
est’s parents disapprove
of their relationship due
to his race. One Spanish
actor has been cast in the
show, although – to the
best of my knowledge –
none of the cast or direc-
torial team is Latino.
not vindicate the groups
choosing to do it.
Ethnicity is not a
costume; it is something
you live with. Even if
you are not painting your
face with shoe polish
and wearing an afro wig,
putting on an ethnicity
and taking it off when
the curtain falls is just as
disingenuous, if not as
crassly offensive.
The cast of MTSoc’s In
The Heights is not entirely
white. A sizeable fraction
of the cast is Asian, but
Asians and Latinos are not
interchangeable, slightly
tan ethnic minorities. This
traditionally white roles
to all, but is hoggish and
oppressive when it means
erasing representation for
specific minorities within
a musical meant to do the
very opposite.
MTSoc know that they
would not have enough
black students signing up
for them to cast Hairspray
appropriately. If they
knew they would not be
able to give the majority
of roles to Latino students,
why attempt to put on a
musical about Latinos?

“It has

accents”
short-sighted mistake has
been made before – such
as when Mexican actor
Ricardo Montalbán played
Khan Noonien Singh in
Star Trek II: Wrath of
Khan – and should not be
made again.
Imperial College is
among the most diverse
universities in the country,
and, to its credit, MTSoc
has never shied away from
casting their most talented
performers as tradition-
ally white characters no
matter their ethnicity.
Colour blind casting can
be good for representa-
tion when it opens up
This has resulted in an
uncomfortable production
featuring white perform-
ers rapping with generic
Latino accents and
boasting of their diverse
South American heritage.
Some cast members have
posted on social media
making light of the fact
that they are pretending
to be Latino. Perhaps this
indicates self-awareness
and embarrassment, but
then again, perhaps not.
Other theatre com-
panies have made the
same mistake: last year
a semi-professional
Australian production
of In The Heights was
cancelled after being
flooded with criticism
for its prominently white
cast (which still had more
Latino cast members than
MTSoc’s production). In a
tweet, Miranda acknowl-
edged that primarily
white productions of In
The Heights are the price
to pay for making the
rights available. This does
“Colour blind
casting can
open up white
roles, but is
hoggish and
oppressive
when it erases
representation
for specific
minorities”
