Imperial's property

I
mperial College
London’s property
holdings are among
the most extensive
of London universities
and include a significant
amount of student ac-
commodation. Through
data obtained from
freedom of information
requests, as well as pub-
licly available records
and statements, Felix has
found Imperial has large
sums of money invested
in property currently
under construction, and
has increased its proper-
ty portfolio dramatically
over the past year.
Imperial owns
GradPad, two blocks of
high-end accommodation
for postgraduate students,
with prices up to £430/
week. The College has
been accused by some
postgraduates of aggres-
sively marketing GradPad
at the expense of alter-
native housing options
accessible to all budgets.
Imperial’s Expansion
Imperial has been
rapidly expanding over
the past few years, with a
number of developments
driven by the move to
White City. Alongside
the new educational
buildings, such as the Mo-
lecular Sciences Research
Hub, which will cost an
estimated £154.4 million,
Imperial has greatly
increased its property
investments. Last year it
increased its holdings in
investment property by
more than £60 million,
from £116.6 million to
£179.1 million, largely
through the acquisition of
a large site in North Acton
currently used by Dixon
Carphone. Sales of invest-
ment property generated
£6 million for the College
last year, while income
from rent from commer-
cial property increased to
nearly £10 million.
Overall, Imperial has
increased the total fixed
assets it owns – a category
that includes freehold land
and buildings, fittings, and
equipment – from £1.37
billion to over £1.5 billion
over the past academic
year. This is one of the
largest portfolios among
London universities –
equivalent to LSE, Queen
Mary’s University of
London, and St. Georges
