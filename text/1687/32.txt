An afternoon with a quiet
genius
An album for cold weather
J
ust looking at the
elaborate setup
laid out on stage
before he made his
appearance, it was hard to
believe it was going to be
a one-man show. Yet, for
two hours, in what was the
penultimate of four sold-
out gigs at the Barbican,
Nils Frahm dominated the
stage only accompanied
by a remarkable array of
instruments that crossed
genres as much as musical
eras.
Jumping between
more than six keyboards
– which ranged from a
grand piano to an organ
to a Roland Juno 60 – the
musician and composer
used his whole body to
operate the equipment,
turning knobs and pushing
buttons on the sequencer
and delay pedals with a
confidence and preci-
sion that didn’t fail
to impress.
Opening with
a few tracks
from his most
recent album
All Melody
and closing
with the older
More, Frahm
appeared com-
fortable between
his gear, taking
time in between
songs to
“push a few buttons”
and change the settings
for the following track,
while trying “not to mess
up” (as he had apparently
done the day before). His
assertive movements and
playful words created the
perfect atmosphere for
juxtaposition of harmonic
and rhythmic layers
looped with increasing
complexity on top of
choral samples, expand-
ing in texture to the point
of filling up the whole
auditorium with warm
and reverberated sounds.
His short use of the
grand piano as a percus-
sion instrument – skilfully
played with some toilet
brushes (yes, that’s right)
– only made me wish he
had gone on for longer,
perhaps indulging less in
the piano solos and more
in dancefloor-friendly in-
termissions like ‘#2’. But,
as he himself was happy
to admit, people seemed
to have a particular affec-
tion for those of his songs
that consisted of “the
same chord played over
and over for six minutes”.
And it’s hard to deny
that it was exactly those
songs that allowed his
live show to reach a few
moments of high lyricism,
compared to which the oc-
casional attempts to bring
in punchier electronic
kicks, although musically
interesting, sometimes
paled.
Despite that, Frahm
perfectly juggled
post-classical melodies
with mesmerising loops
and powerful bass lines
like very few can do.
And after all, if a crowd
of nearly 2,000 spectators
sacrificed a rare sunny day
in London to gather in the
dark and watch him play,
it was going to be worth it.
At £15 for a student
ticket, I couldn’t have
asked for a better way
to spend that cold
Saturday after-
noon.
I
t’s been a while since
I wrote a proper
review.
This isn’t a proper
review.
Though really, they
seldom are.
I’ve listened to this
album twice.
Once yesterday while
I was working, and once
more this morning as I
walked through the snow
into the Felix office. I
think it’s pretty great.
I have neither the time
nor the expertise to write
a comprehensive piece,
so I’ll just relay some of
my thoughts and feelings
from my journey.
The walk normally
takes 35 minutes. This
album is 71 minutes long.
I was taking it slow today.
Honestly I’d never
even heard of Car Seat
Headrest until recently.
Though the name does
feel familiar.
I’d hoped that this time
I’d be able to pay closer
attention to the music,
but honestly I was more
concerned with trying to
stay upright. Making sure
I didn’t slip and fall and
break my leg and die.
I survived.
London is very pretty
in the snow. For about 45
seconds. Before it turns to
sludge.
It’s not even new. It was
recorded back in 2011 on
a laptop. Super lo-fi. I
didn’t hear it at the time.
For whatever reason, they
decided to re-record it.
I’m glad they did.
My socks are wet.
The album is angsty
and fumbling and personal
and sweet. It’s also quite
funny. I like it when bands
are funny.
I thought these boots
were waterproof. Appar-
ently not.
Oh look there’s.
Rhidian. On the picket
line. He looks even colder
than I feel. I don’t know
how he has the energy to
stand there all day every
day. Go Rhid.
I really should listen to
that 2011 version.
Okay I lied a bit. My
walk didn’t really take
me 71 minutes. I started
the album before I left the
house. Before I put my
shoes on. Laced them up
tight. Today is a bobble
hat day. Got to the office
with 15 minutes left. No
one else was there so I
carried on listening.
Sorry, this is hardly a
review at all. Though let’s
be honest, no one reads
these. Except the copy
editors. Love you copy
editors.
This album feels cosy
while all else crumbles
around me. I like it a lot.
Fred’s in the office now.
It’s good music to
soothe an imploding head.
God, I hope the snow
melts before I go home.

Bon Iver has something for everyone
F
irst things first,
22, A Million is
the Kid A of this
generation. With
that in mind, it is absolute-
ly necessary to see Bon
Iver in their current form.
Performing two sets (with
a 22 minute interval) at
the Hammersmith Apollo
with candles adorning
the stage, this night was
a special occasion – it
was intimate and it was
homely, despite being just
one of their eight shows
there over two weeks.
New songs such as
‘10 d E A T H b R E a S
T’ and ‘715 – CRΣΣKS’
which are perhaps too ex-
perimental (for some) on
record are transcendental
and evolve into something
else in concert, with pitch
perfect vocals and slight
changes to arrangements.
But don’t worry, the older
songs are amazing to see
live too. With folky sing-
alongs found in ‘Skinny
Love’ and ‘The Wolves’,
and songs in which the
crowd is so quiet you
could hear a pin drop
between breaths such as
‘Woods’, you’ll experi-
ence a mix of feelings
seldom seen in a concert,
particularly in this day
and age of one-note
bands, such as Fishcat and
the Twattymen.
There’s lots of head-
bobbing and even a little
bit of dancing in the
crowd; a rare sight for a
band you’re more likely
to listen to while stoned in
a dark room with the snow
falling silently outside,
than in a club or a house
party. The highlights were
22, A Million songs ‘33
“GOD”’ and ‘8 (circle)’.
Pushing the soundsystem
to the limit (and on a
couple of occasions,
past it) and yet somehow
giving me goosebumps
in the back of my neck
at the same time, those
tracks cemented the night
as a legendary concert.
‘8 (circle)’ had a massive
build up with a beautiful-
ly performed trombone
solo. It was so good, so
magical, it’s probably
what summoned the snow
to London the following
morning.
Bon Iver united audi-
ences and genres with a
carefully crafted and pas-
sionate show. If, by some
miracle, you can find
a ticket to a remaining
night, seize it immediate-
ly. You won’t regret it.
King Gizz are exactly as you’d expect: fucking great
T
he queue looped
around two
corners as fans
waited eagerly to
pass beneath the dome of
the O2 Academy Brixton.
Spanning the reader-
graph above them hailed
the cause: Australian
psych-rockers King
Gizzard and the Lizard
Wizard. Performing their
only London show in the
support of the immense
five albums they released
last year, the show sold
out quickly, which was
immediately noticeable
upon arrival.
The tight packing
beneath the stage made
moving difficult; the one
way which was physically
acceptable to turn was
towards the band. Once
they came on, however,
you didn’t want to look
away. Starting with the
first single off the first
album of 2017 (Flying
Microtonal Banana),
‘Rattlesnake’, the cheers
from the crowd soon
became the chanting of
the repetitive lyrics. Much
like a snake itself, the pit
started to writhe and sway,
many fans losing their
balance as the sardines
attempted to mosh.
Looming above them
were abstract, psychedelic
projections synchronised
to the music, which cast
luminous colours across
the sweat-laden faces of
the people beneath.
As the 7-piece contin-
ued into their first set, the
energy of both the music
and crowd remained high,
with neither stopping for
air if they could avoid it.
Following ‘Rattlesnake’
came the band’s final
single from 2017, ‘Green-
house Heat Death’, from
their New Year’s Eve
released album Gumboot
Soup. Swaying turned
to jumping. I lost my
shoe. Jumping turned to
pushing and then back to
swaying. I lost my sock.
The remaining singles
from Flying Microtonal
Banana, ‘Nuclear Fusion’
and ‘Sleep Drifter’ came
and went, with no relent
from the crowd.
Suddenlythemovement
stopped. The band were
no longer above. Replac-
ing the enchanting projec-
tions was a big red timer,
counting down from 15.
What was at the end was
anyone’s guess. This is
the band who record their
vocals through iPhones.
The band who dedicated
a third of an album to
a story about a cyborg
who eventually destroys
the universe through
vomiting. This is the band
who named themselves
King Gizzard and the
Lizard Wizard for fuck’s
sake. When the timer hit
zero all eyes were on the
stage. Fortunately, it just
marked the beginning of
another set.
This set appeared to be
more chilled in its ways,
the music being slower,
more relaxed. This memo
didn’t make it to the
crowd apparently, where
the frantic movement
and energy previously
found did not stop. This
set included ‘Han-Tyumi
the Confused Cyborg’,
a track from Murder of
the Universe, the second
of 2017’s albums; also
played from this was
‘Welcome to an Altered
Universe’ and ‘The Lord
of Lightning’. The final
2017 material exhibited
that evening was then
produced, the single
‘Crumbling Castle’ and
the eponymous ‘Poly-
gondwanaland’, all from
the fourth release of 2017.
Wrapping up the evening,
King Gizz resorted to
their critically acclaimed
Nonagon Infinity (2016).
Describedasa“never-end-
ing album” by its vocalist
Stuart Mackenzie, ‘Robot
Stop’, ‘Big Fig Wasp’ and
‘Gamma Knife’, arguably
their most famous song,
were played in indis-
cernible fashion to the
untrained ear, instead
forming a punchy energet-
ic end to a kaleidoscopic,
mind-blowing event, as
to be expected from this
whirlwind of a band.

what often felt like an
intimate show put on for
a close circle of friends,
rather than a public per-
formance in front of a big
crowd.
During the course of
each track, what often
started as a deceivingly
simple melody, quietly
crafted on the harmonic or
the upright piano, would
– with a few exceptions –
quickly evolve
into an
