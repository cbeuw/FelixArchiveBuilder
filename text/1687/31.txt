Alvvays assert themselves with a spectacular show
I
n fluorescent light,
antisocialites…”
croons Molly Rankin
during a superb live
rendition of the track
‘Dreams Tonite’ from
Alvvays’ most recent
effort, Antisocialites. It’s
easy to feel she’s describ-
ing the crowd as we stand
captivated under dreamy
stage lights with barely a
sense of who’s around us.
The lyric especially
resonates with me this
time as I watch alone,
my company for the
evening stuck in traffic
on their way to Camden’s
legendary Roundhouse.
The venue suits the band
well: the five-piece fill
the stage nicely, bedecked
with vintage guitars,
synths, and amps in front
of a hypnotic projected
backdrop that resembles
a 70s Doctor Who title
sequence.
A distinct step up in
size from where they’ve
performed on past UK
tours, they’re playing
the sold-out show with
remarkable cool, their
effort centred on nailing
the technical aspects of
their performance. And
this too they do with
ease, the whole band
playing flawlessly, with
each instrument clear and
audible, and the backing
vocals loud enough to
beautifully mesh with
Rankin’s lead. This is
perhaps a testament to the
quality of the sound team
at Roundhouse as well as
the band.
Either way, they
sounded excellent. Even
the subtle shifts in guitar
tones and synth textures
that made their latest
record such an engaging
cut compared to much
of the dream pop scene
were perceptible. In fact,
the detail and clarity of
Alvvays’sound here rivals
some of the live studio
performances they’ve
done recently for the likes
of Seattle alt-rock radio
station KEXP.
But Alvvays demon-
strate that they are a great
live act because they
don’t stop at perfecting
the technicality of the per-
formance. Rankin’s quips
and comments between
tracks grab smiles as usual
and continue to cement
the view propagated by
the band’s online follow-
ing that Alvvays are the
glorious pinnacle of Cana-
dian-indie-pop-cuteness.
At one point she asks the
audience for recommen-
dations of things to do
during the band’s day-off
in London: a refreshing
disregard of the band’s
growing fame.
The 15 song setlist was
centred on Antisociallites
with nine of the album’s
ten tracks performed (a
treat for anyone who
loved that record as much
as I did) but kept things
interesting with a perfor-
mance of a new, currently
unreleased song ‘Pecking
Order’, as well as a cover
of Elastica’s ‘Blue’ in
the encore, which they
adapted to their jangly
sound surprisingly well.
In some ways it was
a shame that the band’s
dreamier tracks set such
a relaxed atmosphere that
the audience never fully
reciprocated the band’s
high energy on their
heavier tracks, but all in
all Alvvays delivered a
fantastic performance that
will see them continue
to climb to the top of the
indie scene.
Franz Ferdinand prove that they can still rock
R
eturning to
another sold-
out Brixton
Academy, Franz
Ferdinand demonstrated
that their new material
is just as capable as their
back-catalogue of indie
anthems at getting nearly
five thousand people
dancing. The band are
touring their recently re-
leased fifth album, Always
Ascending, which is their
first in five years. In that
time, the band recorded
and toured an album with
American electro-pop
duo Sparks and then lost
founding member and
rhythm guitarist Nick
McCarthy who has been
replaced by new members
Dino Bardot (guitar) and
Julian Corrie (keyboards
and backing vocals).
Nonetheless, the recon-
figured lineup sounded as
tight as ever on Saturday
and cracked through an
eighteen song set, half of
which consisted of tracks
from Always Ascending.
Indeed, Franz Ferdinand
are wearing their new
sound and configuration
with pride, perhaps as the
result of lead singer Alex
Kapranos finally fully
taking the centre stage as
frontman, allowing his
bandmates to cement as
his backing unit.
That said, the core
elements of a great old-
school Franz Ferdinand
gig were still present:
Kapranos fervently
jumping and striding
about the stage, the band
playing with impressive
tightness and energy,
and the audience feeding
off this as they sang and
danced through bangers
and ballads alike.
They opened with
the title track from
their latest LP, before
swinging through a mix
of songs spanning their
discography, culminating
in a 10-minute version
of ‘This Fire’, from their
eponymous 2004 debut,
which has long been a
favourite gig-closer for
the band. The dominance
of songs from Always
Ascending left little room
for anything other than the
top hits from Franz Ferdi-
nand’s first four records,
but while these songs’
familiarity usually gener-
ates the biggest response
from crowds, there was
no sense of dependence
on them to drive the gig
on this night. Rather, the
DNA of the newly remade
five-piece that produced
Always Ascending has
made its way into the rest
of the band’s material
resulting in a decade and
a half’s worth of great
songs presented under
a revitalised sound and
aesthetic.
A particular highlight
was the decision to
introduce a saxophone
player in the encore who
performed on ‘Love Illu-
mination’ and soloed in
the extended disco outro
of recent single ‘Feel the
Love Go’. In moments
like this, Franz Ferdi-
nand’s ongoing ability to
take the pop-rock quirks
that characterise their
studio material to a live
setting shines through
such that, across material
old and new, they are able
to thrill audiences for a
couple of hours – and it’s
certainly worth it.
