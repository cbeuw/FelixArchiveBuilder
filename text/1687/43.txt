RSM men’s hockey hold onto sharpley cup!
A
fter an intense
warm up,
Royal School
of Mines won
the toss and chose to play
with the sun behind them.
It did little good. Four
minutes into the game and
all the meticulous game
day preparations seemed
to be in vain, as Camborne
School of Mines scored
the opener. This only
proved to spur on RSM. A
goal line save to prevent
an equaliser added to the
frustration, but it wasn’t
long before Henry Sewell
set up Rich Price for a
well worked goal to raise
RSM spirits both on and
off the pitch. Celebrations
were short lived though,
as a quick counter attack
from CSM cancelled out
the comeback effort and
brought the game to 2-1
with ten minutes remain-
ing in the first half. A
frantic end to the half saw
a stray cross diverted in
off RSM defender, Steve
Pugh, to gift Camborne a
3-1 lead at the half time
whistle.
Rousing words from
the older lads rallied
the side, and the Royal
Miners from London went
into the second half with
nothing left to lose. A
goal-line scramble ended
in disappointment as
the RSM comeback was
denied once more. This
lead to yet another swift
counter attack with four
Cornish players breaking
free – a goal looked
certain to cement CSM’s
victory. Jonny Jones had
other ideas as he stormed
back to make a last ditch
interception to salvage
any hope RSM had.
Jonny Jones was the
pivotal man once more
as he drilled home a short
corner to bring the game
to 3-2 with 15 minutes
remaining. Sensing the
game was getting away
from them, CSM held the
ball in an attempt to run
the clock down. This only
served to motivate RSM
more as Howard Richards
nearly broke the back-
board with a cannon of a
shot to level the match at
3-3 with just five minutes
left to play.
Knowing a draw
would be enough to
retain the Sharpley Cup,
the Royal Miners dug in
and defended with their
lives to see the game out.
As the seconds ticked
past 70 minutes, the ball
found its way back into
the RSM circle and a late
tackle by Captain Rowan
Hedgecock awarded
CSM’s Callum Fraser a
penalty stroke with the
final hit of the game. It
seemed the comeback was
wasted, but first year goal
keeper Lekan Ogunlana
had been given a different
script. A diving save to
his right denied the striker
his moment of glory, and
ensured the Sharpley Cup
would return to London
for a fifth consecutive
year.
Tough loss for RSM women’s hockey

:30am on Bottle
Match morning –
the RSM hockey
girls were cruising
across Cornwall with
tunes blasting and every-
one feeling nervous and
excited. Some were so
overcome with the excite-
ment they couldn’t handle
it and had a little nap.
The match began with
the roar of the RSM
crowd rightly drowning
out the half-hearted CSM
attemptsatmakinganoise.
The girls fought hard
for the first seven or so
minutes, with the defence
putting up an amazing
fight. Unfortunately
CSM managed to get
through and we conceded
our first goal. Not to let
anyone’s spirits get low
the older girls yelled out
encouragements and kept
everyone’s heads up. Our
new goalkeeper Qing
Hua, who had only started
playing a few weeks
previously, kept her head
in the game. CSM were
quick and strong on the
ball, making fast runs
which kept our wingers
Avni Patel, Yvonne Riley
,and Ruth Pike on their
toes. Not much(ish) could
get past our defenders
and our fresher’s Minty
Hampden-Martin and
Elin Mars-Jones worked
incredibly hard along
with Bottle Match oldies
Evelyn Mason and Beth
Grant and put pressure
on the CSM attackers,
channelling them into
the corners where our
glorious RSM spectators
voiced their approval.
Alice Tidswell domi-
nated her central position,
sending out some brilliant
balls, and being down-
right amazing despite
being fresh out of two
injuries and having driven
a minibus 300 miles the
day before, along with
Evelyn Mason and Ruth
Pike (our hockey girls
truly are the best). The
champagne moment goes
to her dive, which resulted
in her saving yet another
goal. Beth Grant, captain
Emily Gusterson, and
Louisa Young made CSM
work hard and powered
their way past players
sending the ball up to
RSM guru Beth Holman
who showed off her stick
skills alongside Yvonne
where they gave the CSM
defenders a fright in our
attacking D.
In the second half we
played our best hockey
yet and went a full 15
minutes with good
possession and a strong
attack. Our defence made
us extremely proud with
fresher Elin earning Man
of the Match and Evelyn,
Naomi Tan, Minty, and
Beth fighting hard right to
the very end.
Sadly we lost the game,
but we worked hard and
(most importantly) had
more fun.

Imperial dodgeball – Wolverines stay undefeated!
G
oing into last
w e e k e n d ,
I m p e r i a l
Wolverines 1st
team were leading the
University Dodgeball
League South, closely
followed behind by
Hertfordshire Stags A’s
in second place. Last
Saturday saw the second
match of a back to back
Imperial/Hertfordshire
showdown; the winner of
which would most likely
go on to win the league.
At the previous encoun-
ter, we narrowly ousted
a strong Hertfordshire
team, 16-12; having to
earn every point from an
unfaltering opposition.
Although Hertfordshire
lost the last fixture, with
a much stronger point dif-
ference than us, a win for
them could prove pivotal
in the conclusion of the
league.
The game started and
it was clear from the
start that Hertfordshire
changed their gameplan
from the previous match.
Instead of single throws
which allowed us gain lots
of catches, Herts resolved
to two ball throws, par-
ticularly pinning our two
wings, Nithin Thoppuram
and Steve Ndumbe. Hert-
fordshire set the tempo in
the first game, catching
us off guard and pinging
us out individually until
eventually, Steve was
a lone Wolverine faced
with four Herts players.
With little time left, Steve
single handedly whittled
down the Stags to a single
player. The game ended a
draw – a fortunate result
considering our poor team
effort.
After a shaky start,
we settled as a team and
concentrated on shaping
the game to our liking.
We won the next few
games with fantastic
throw accuracy from Vino
for example from our
Captain, Filip Sebest,
allowed us to run down
the clock and minimise
the effectiveness of their
game victory. We knew
our strategy was working
as we entered the break;
the score at 8-4.
Although we struggled
to gain three ball advan-
tage off the start of each
match, sporadic catches
from Leo Haigh and
Lochlann Allison gave us
initial number advantages
which then allowed our
strong throwers to pick off
the Stags one by one. We
would’ve been naïve to
think Hertfordshire would
go down without a fight,
gaining small advantages
of their own from getting
hits off pre-throws and
with punishing counters at
the half way line.
In the end, we remained
absolute as a team, and
worked a well-deserved
victory from our closest
rivals. With two wins
from two against the Stags
and remaining unbeaten,
we have a fantastic chance
of defending our league
champions title. However,
the season is far from over:
fierce competition from
the likes of UCL Pumas
and UEA Falcons 1s have
the potential to cause an
upset. We will however,
as always, throw together
and dodge alone.

S
ince losing to
Kingston 1s at the
beginning of the
season (despite
great play), we faced them
again last week knowing
we had something to
prove. The match started
off fast-paced with solid
play from IC, especially
from defensive duo Laila
Howe and Filippa Furniss,
who fought relentlessly
taking interception after
interception. This meant at
the end of the first quarter
we were winning 14-8. It
was clear, however, from
the start of the second
quarter that Kingston
were not going to let it be
an easy win for us.
With some great
shooting from freshers
Tilly Cole and Emily
Snook we were able to
hold on to the lead, but
by the end of the third
quarter we were only up
by five. With an inter-
ception early on in the
fourth quarter from the
opposition we knew we

could not afford to make
any more mistakes. This
was no problem for our
other two 1s freshers
Aimee Spurling and Anna
Seidel who steadied the
pace of the game and
kept the centre court calm
ensuring we did not give
away any more turnovers.
The final score was
45-43 to IC which only
goes to show how much
we have improved since
the beginning of the
season. If you want to
see an even more intense
and well contested game
be sure to look out for us
as the headlining event at
Varsity! It is the first time
in history that Netball
are headlining, so please
show your support for
us next weekend in the
fight for gold against the
medics.
