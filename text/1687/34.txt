DRAGON BALL
FIGHTERZ
I’m just saiyan: Dragon Ball FighterZ
P
laying this game
as a long-time fan
of Dragon Ball
Z and the fighter
genre, I can say, without a
doubt, that DBZ Fighterz
feels like a love letter
written to its fans. The
game has surpassed both
limits and expectations of
the fighting game genre,
going even further beyond
with spectacular original
soundtrack and gorgeous
visuals, while at the
same time being a perfect
homage to its anime. In
all of its Saiyan glory,
DBZ Fighterz does have a
small fault in its otherwise
perfectly rendered abs
which I’ll discuss later.
Now lets break it down, in
Lucio style.
The story begins
with the player finding
themselves in the (stolen)
body of our spikey haired
protagonist Goku, due to
a global soul disturbance
that has resulted in the
rest of the God-like
DBZ cast (especially
Yamcha) being drastically
weakened. With char-
acters only returning to
their full strength when
you control them, (in a
peculiar, a steroid filled
version of Freaky Friday)
you progress through
the story to unravel the
mystery that surrounds
Android 21 and her army
of clones. The story is split
into three main arcs, each
centred around a different
character, leading to an
epic showdown with the
aforementioned android.
For a typical fighter the
campaign is quite lengthy,
however it’s definitely
worth a playthrough to
unlock Android 21 as a
playable character.
Unlike previous games
in its franchise, DBZ
Fighterz also includes
the ability to strengthen
the bonds you have with
certain characters. This
improves their abilities
and power as well as
open up unique dialogue.
The campaign also boasts
out his Saiyan Pride in a
testosterone fuelled rage.
Without a doubt, this
is one of the best fighting
games of this year and
maybe this decade,
Dragon Ball Fighterz
brings new innovative
combat that feels fresh
and exhilarating. Con-
sisting of a basic fighting
game control scheme
with the three primary
attack buttons, being
light, medium, heavy, and
the fourth being a special
move attack, the simplic-
ity of the controls makes
it easy for newcomers
to pick up. Players fight
in 3-person teams with
team mechanics such
as dynamic switching
between characters and
assists which can range
from basic attacks to
super moves. The game
lends a caring hand to
beginners by its intro-
duction of auto combos
which require only one
button to be pressed
multiple times, providing
both decent damage and
fantastic visuals. This is
not to say that the game is
without depth; additional
investment of time and
effort into mastering
more advanced combos
and being creative with
in- game mechanics can
lead to truly terrifying
results. Each character
features their own distinct
playstyle, for example
Android 16 who is a bulky
grapple type character and
Hit, who is a strong coun-
ter-based character.
There is plenty to
learn and to discover,
with unique in-game
cutscenes triggered by
certain actions (recreating
moments from the anime),
as well as some characters
possessing unique abili-
ties. Additional features
of the combat including
‘Dragon Rush’ which is
scenes are cinematics that
occur if you defeat one of
the opponent’s characters
with a super or heavy
attack, ranging from your
opponent hurtling through
pillars of rock or being
obliterated off the face of
the earth.
Despite my unending
praise of DBZ Fighterz
there is an issue beneath
its almost perfect form;
the online multiplayer can
be some of the most rage
inducing material on the
planet, with connection
issues that can make or
break a match, completely
ruining the spontaneous
nature of the gameplay.
With patches on their
way, these server issues
should be resolved soon,
but in the meantime the
offline options are more
than enough to satiate
your interest and provide
endless fun.
I without a doubt, rec-
ommend this game to any
fighting game enthusiast
or just a casual Dragon
Ball fan. For me, this
game is near perfect but
it hasn’t reached its final
form, it’s a combination
of everything good about
Dragon Ball and the
fighting genre, however
the online latency issues
let this masterpiece down.
