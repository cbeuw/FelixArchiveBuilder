A powerful revival of the mystery of Hanging Rock
O
n Valentine’s
Day, 1900,
three pupils and
a teacher from
Appleyard College, an up-
per-class girls’ boarding
school, disappear during
a class trip to Hanging
Rock, a volcanic moun-
tain in Victoria, Australia.
This is the premise of Joan
Lindsay’s 1967 novel and
Peter Weir’s subsequent
film adaptation, both sub-
jects of critical acclaim
and, arguably, cult classic
status. Though fictitious,
the story is so compelling
that it is widely believed
to be true, thanks partly
to Lindsay’s often coy and
mysterious answers about
its basis in reality. Not
having seen the film or
read the novel I came into
the theatre with only a
cursory knowledge of the
story, but it was impossi-
ble not to set expectations
high when both the source
material and its adaptation
have been so successful.
The play starts with five
schoolgirls on a sparse
stage, narrating the events
of Saturday, Valentine’s
Day, 1900. Despite the
setting of the play, they
are wearing modern
school attire: blazers and
pleated skirts that would
not look out of place on a
secondary school student
in 2018. In 1900, after
the school group have
lunch, four of the girls,
Miranda, Marion, Irma,
and Edith leave the rest
of the group to climb the
rock. Miranda is clearly
the leader of the group,
the one the other look up
to. Edith is the hanger-on;
she struggles to keep pace
with the other girls and
begins to fall behind. As
she watches, the other
girls vanish into the
rock. The five-strong cast
slowly move forwards as
they speak, closer to the
audience and closer to the
end of the stage. Their nar-
ration is interspersed with
blackouts. It’s incredibly
simple, but, somehow,
very captivating. The
five actors are phenom-
enal and with only their
voices and playwright
Tom Wright’s words they
conjure up images of what
might have happened. The
empty stage, their ringing
voices and stark lighting
help your own imagina-
tion to create images far
more sinister than what
could have been captured
on stage. The switching
perspective between the
girls and the frequent
blackout create a story
told in cut scenes, remi-
niscent of horror films.
The aftermath of the
girls’ disappearance takes
on a more conventional
storytelling, with the
scenes being acted on
stage. The narrators
become actors in the story.
There are searches for the
girls and their teacher,
yet nothing is found. The
school community begins
unravelling and headmis-
tress, Miss Appleyard,
begins taking out her frus-
tration on Sara, a girl who
cannot seem to fit into
what society demands of
an upper-class woman.
Michael, an Englishman,
embarksonasolitaryquest
to find the girls. These
scenes are interspersed
with blackouts and each
scene is accompanied by
a cryptic neon heading
above the stage. Through
Michael and Miss Ap-
pleyard, Wright explores
themes of colonialism
and power, centring on
Australia. What Michael
has come to learn of the
wilderness of Australia
terrifies him. Miss Apple-
yard’s attempts to mould
Sara to her will mirrors
the attempt to tame and
conquer Australia. It’s
certainly innovative sto-
rytelling, but never quite
reaches the same intensity
as the opening of the play.
The five-member cast
is without question one
of the greatest strength of
this production – they take
on different characters
with ease yet manage to
keep them distinct indi-
viduals. Elizabeth Nabben
and Amber McMahon are
particularly compelling
as Miss Appleyard and
Michael, respectively. The
almost bare stage with its
liberal use of black, the
stark lighting, frequent
The cult horror tale of missing schoolgirls in Australia gets an inventive twist in Tom Wright’s adaptation for the
stage at the Barbican Centre.

blackouts and neon
titles above the stage all
combine to create a tense
atmosphere and instil real
fear into the audience.
Director Matthew Lutton
almost takes this minimal-
ist style to an extreme, and
there are certainly points
where it feels a little
overused. However, it
doesn’t, detract too much
from the overall effect of
the play.
Transferring art
between media is always
a gamble and what makes
an exceptional novel or
film could always fall flat
on the stage. This certain-
ly isn’t the case with Tom
Wright’s adaptation of
Picnic at Hanging Rock.
He manages to capture a
palpable sense of horror
with his narrative and also
uses it to highlight impor-
tant themes in the story.
The four-day run at The
Barbican was painfully
short for such a powerful
piece of work and it
will, hopefully, return to
London in the near future.
