Mark Dion – theatre of the natural world brings the
Thames beaches to the Whitechapel Gallery
Something of a hit and miss, a retrospective of Mark Dion’s work is most successful when it embraces the realities
of nature.

T
he artwork in
Mark Dion’s ex-
hibition, Theatre
of the Natural
World, feels like it was
made by someone who
loves the idea of the life
sciences but hasn’t taken
a science course since
secondary school. He’s
an American artist who
combines a wide range
of media into large-scale
sculptures, books, and
installations. His work
deals with the ideas,
practices, and institutions
surrounding naturalists
and natural history; he
has filled the three rooms
of his solo exhibition at
Whitechapel Gallery with
an eclectic collection
of flags, drawings, text,
props, live birds, photo-
graphs, mannequins, and
posters.
I walked into this
exhibition hoping to find
relevant, contemporary
work engaging with soci-
ety’s complex relationship
with the natural world.
Instead, I found a series
of cinematic stage sets
designed to invoke dated
fantasies of eccentrics
and intellectuals, who,
like Dion himself, appear
contenttoco-optthevisual
aesthetics of biology and
natural history without
regard for the discipline or
wonder essential to either
field.
In The Naturalist’s
Study, Dion has decorated
a room with couches,
drawings, illustrations,
and sculptures, turning
the gallery space into
drawing room from two
hundred years ago. The
décor is intended to evoke
the aura of a 19th
century
naturalist, and the room’s
props stand in as treasures
collected from exotic
trips overseas. Some of
the work included makes
passing hints at a conser-
vationist frame of mind:
a black and white series
of photographs depicting
stuffed polar bears lines
one wall. Other inclusions
throw the façade out the
window: all of the tables
are covered edge to edge
with books Dion has
published, and which are
on offer from the gift shop
downstairs. No comment,
either, on the daring
explorers (or their collec-
tions) who thrived on the
peak of natural history’s
imperialist wave.
A giant black metal
birdcage dominates the
first of the gallery’s four
rooms. In the cage’s centre
stands the barren trunk of
a large tree, and around it
lies a collection of books
and objects related to the
study of birds. 22 live
zebra finches (Taeniopy-
gia guttata) and up to four
human visitors at a time
(the maximum allowed in
the cage) move through
the space, and bring life
to Dion’s fabricated world
of sets and props. The
piece, called The Library
for the Birds of London
grasps halfheartedly at
one metaphor or the other
for the human condition,
but its real strength is in
its physical presence. It’s
a beautiful piece – black
mesh around barren
branches – and the care
with which Dion and his
team have attended to
the health and wellness
of the birds is made clear
in the long list posted on
the gallery wall, titled
‘Commonly Asked Ques-
tions about the Birds’.
In the third room of the
exhibition, I found the
most exciting and concep-
tually elegant piece of the
night, a work from 1999
titled Tate Thames Dig.
Dion and a crew of volun-
teers dredged the topsoil
of two tidal beaches near
the Tate Britain and the
(then still to be built) Tate
Modern. Everything they
uncovered, from horse
teeth to oyster shells,
bullets, leather soles, toys,
ceramic fragments, rings,
even a message in a bottle,
are kept in an enormous,
double-sided wooden
cabinet. The results of
each excavation site are
kept on shelves and in
drawers on either side of
the cabinet. Visitors are
invited to walk around the
piece, open drawers, and
view all the specimens
under glass, which are
sorted into what Dion calls
“taxonomies”: organized
groups based on material,
function, color, topology,
and morphology.
A fusion between
museum exhibit and
archaeological dig, Tate
Thames Dig successfully
brings together the visual
aesthetics and physical
processes of natural
history. Here, Dion finally
carries out the tasks of
collecting and sorting
that are essential to the
work of naturalists and
taxonomists. By actually
leaving his studio to ex-
perience the natural world
and practice the scientific
work he celebrates in the
rest of this exhibition,
Dion adds content and
weight to his stage sets.
The fragments of
“Dion has
taken the
fantasy of
the armchair
biologist out
of the study
and into the
sunlight ”
London on display in
the collection from the
dredging are a celebration
of the capital’s history
and our relationship with
nature and each other. The
care taken to organize
every object is an almost
joyful mirroring of the
process natural scientists
have used to understand
the mysteries of life and
the world around us. At
last, Dion has taken the
fantasy of the armchair
biologist out of the study
and into the sunlight by
the Thames. Only by
getting dirty and really
engaging with the worlds
whose language he adopts
can Mark Dion get out of
his own study and share
with us what there is to
see.
