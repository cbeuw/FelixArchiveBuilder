Making sure to look after your
friends
Talking to friends can be much easier than speaking to a stranger. Here are
some top tips on how to look out for friends who might be struggling.

he Under Pressure
campaign this
week has high-
lighted the stress
associated with studying
and various ways to deal
with it. However, many
students at Imperial strug-
gle with their mental health
in silence due to the perva-
sive attitude that having
difficulties with mental
health is a weakness. This
is also the kind of issue that
feeds itself: people assume
nobody else is struggling,
so they stay silent and then
the next person to struggle
again assumes nobody
else is having difficulty.
It is incredibly difficult to
break this cycle directly.
However there is some-
thing we can do: look after
your friends.
Ultimately, it’s a lot
easier to talk to a friend if
you’re struggling than a
stranger (or, even worse, a
stranger who may be able
to impact your grade).
As someone’s friend, you
can provide them with a
comfortable and support-
ive setting to discuss any
difficulties. You’re also in
a good position to notice
the key outward signs that
someone is struggling.
The Imperial Counselling
Service recommends four
key areas to look out for:
Behavioural Changes:
Are they acting differ-
ently? Examples include
changes in sleeping or
eating habits, withdrawal
from social contact and
activities, not attending
lectures or society ac-
tivities as they normally
would, and increased use
of drugs and alcohol.
Physical Changes:
Do they look different?
Examples include notice-
able weight gain or loss,
looking pale or tired or
noticeably anxious and
worried, and sudden
changes in personal
hygiene.
Emotional Changes:
Have their moods
changed? Examples
include being consistently
more tearful, irritable
or sensitive, and more
frequent/severe mood
swings.
Intellectual Changes:
Is what they are saying
very different? Examples
include continual
negative thinking, such
as self-deprecating state-
ments or thinking that
the worst-case scenario is
always going to happen,
inability to concentrate,
and difficulty following
conversations.
As well as being able to
notice these signs, it’s also
important to have an idea
of what to do to support
your friends. Here’s a
brief overview of things
to remember:
1. Start the con-
versation: One of the
most helpful things you
can do is ask your friend
how they are doing, and
not just superficially. If
you have noticed any
of the signs mentioned
above, your friend might
appreciate the opportunity
to get things off their
chest. Remember that it
is usually easier to have
these conversations in
private and when you both
have enough time to chat.
The tone of the conver-
sation is also important:
avoid leading questions
and don’t probe beyond
what your friend is com-
fortable with. You don’t
need to give advice, as
often these conversations
are useful on their own.
2. Make sure they’re
taking care of themselves:
Whether it’s making sure
that they’re having fun
with friends, eating right,
exercising or sleeping
more. Ultimately, taking
care of your mental
wellbeing is especially
important when things
are tough. If your friend
is dropping the ball on
these things, you can text
reminders or organise
events to give them that
extra nudge.
3. Take care of
yourself first: This is by
far the most important
point. You don’t need
to be on call 24-hours a
day, seven days a week.
Helping a friend with their
struggles requires a lot of
emotional effort, and if
you’re burning out its ok
to take a step back. It’s also
important to remember
that you might not be able
to solve the issues your
friend is struggling with,
and it may get to the point
where professional help is
needed. If that’s the case,
recognise that what they
need is not something that
you can give.
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
F
rom Felix articles to Under Pressure
week, my term so far has been full to
the brim with mental health talks and
discussions. I’m well aware that, as
this is the first year my position has existed,
most of the things I start are too big for me
to be able to finish. That said, I’ve managed
to get bits and bobs done this year.
Firstly, I’ve been in discussions with the
Union Shop about stocking wellbeing
related items. So far, they have agreed to
stock fidget cubes (with a little description
from me about why they’re useful) and will
review stocking other items suggested by
me depending on how they sell.
Additionally, I’ve been working very
hard to put wellbeing and liberation on
the map at Union Council. I’ve passed a
paper regarding guidelines to make Union
activities more accessible to people with
dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, and autism, and
regularly advocated for a meeting room that
is fully wheelchair accessible (which, so far,
it has not been). I’ve also seconded papers
on the creation of a liberation officer to
represent those from poorer backgrounds,
now subject to a consultation (please take
part!) and the creation of an official petitions
system which is now underway. I’ve also
attended meetings of the Community
and Welfare Board (essentially the welfare
subcommittee of council) and met with
members of college staff to discuss
everything from having better counselling
provision on non-SK campuses (including
White City) to putting mental health before
academic attainment.
However, my position’s time to shine will
be during exams next term when I will be
doing work with a college-wide campaign
centred around the topics covered in my
article. Mentality will also have a role in the
campaign, so keep an eye out for it!
