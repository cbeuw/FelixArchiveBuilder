Pioneering treatments for healing chronic wounds

In recent times, there have been many advancements in treatment of chronic wounds – we explore a few of the
most exciting and innovative technological advances in this field over the last few years.
C
hronic wounds
differ from
normal acute
wounds, because
they do not go through the
normal healing process
of inflammation, prolif-
eration, and remodelling;
instead they stop at the
inflammation stage, and
the healing process is
stopped completely.
Chronic wounds often
require amputations, and
may lead to death.
Chronic wounds are
associated with other
health problems including
diabetes, obesity, and
poor circulation; thus,
it is more prevalent in
developed countries. It is
estimated that 1-2% of the
population in developed
countries will experience
a chronic wound during
their lifetime. In the US
alone, there are over six
million chronic wound
patients, and treatment is
costing around $25 billion
per year. However there
has been many important
breakthroughs recently
in the field of treating
chronic wounds.
First, a biotechnology
company in Iceland
named Kerecis Ltd. has
developed ways to treat
wounds using materials
made from fish skin. The
entiate, and eventually
turn into living tissue.
Another recent discov-
ery was the importance
of miRNA in chronic
wound healing. MicroR-
NAs or miRNAs are
short non-coding RNA
sequences that can partic-
ipate in regulating gene
expression, through post
transcriptional silencing
of mRNAs. Recently
miRNA has been found to
beinvolvedinmanydiffer-
ent diseases, and chronic
wounds is no different.
Indeed, it was found that
miRNA levels in normal
acute and chronic wound
healing differs; thus, the
under-expression and
over-expression of certain
miRNAs are responsible
for disrupting the normal
company’s products have
already been approved
by the FDA, and it can
be used to treat acute,
chronic, and oral wounds.
The company’s products
are made from drying
and processing cod skin.
Fish skin is naturally rich
in omega-3 fatty acids,
which yield anti-inflam-
matory effects that can
speed up the healing
process. The material sub-
stitutes the extracellular
matrix crucial for healing
and lacking in chronic
wound patients.
Theextracellularmatrix
is composed of a variety
of polysaccharides, water,
and collagen proteins, and
the scaffolding provided
by the matrix recruits cells
which proliferate, differ-
stages of wound healing.
The miRNAs involved
in wound healing are
being discovered, and this
provides the possibility of
gene therapy for patients.
However, it is not yet a
valid therapy, as there
needs to be a suitable
delivery system of drugs
that can overcome intra-
cellular and extracellular
barriers.
Lastly, technology that
targets the microenviron-
ment around the wound
has been proven to accel-
erate the healing process.
This involves using lactic
acid bacteria as vectors
to produce and deliver a
human chemokine (sig-
nalling proteins) to the site
of the wound. The specific
chemokine being upregu-
lated is CXCL12, and its
degradation is slowed, as
the lactic acid produced
by the bacteria lowers the
pH. The resulting change
in the microenvironment
leads to more immune
cells gathering, and they
also become more spe-
cialised, producing more
TGFß, a growth factor
involved in healing.
Overall, there are
exciting prospects for the
future of treating chronic
wounds, although some
technology is still in the
developmental stage,
they are showing great
promise. Chronic wounds
still affects millions of
patients, and the technol-
ogies discussed in this
article may provide a cure
for them.
