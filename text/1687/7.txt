n the summer of
2015, I was lucky
enough to visit
Borneo; here I was
able to observe orangu-
tans in the wild, amongst
other spectacular wild-
life. This was a very
humbling experience
and one that I will never
forget! Recently a por-
tion of the news really
caught my attention –
for the wrong reasons,
however. They reported
on a study which found
that between 1999 and
2015, a period of just
16 years, the population
of Bornean orangutans
had dropped by over
half. This figure may not
sound that alarming, but
this enigmatic decline
has a very sinister cause:
the exploitation of the
natural world to supply
the developed world with
cheap goods such as palm
oil. The biggest contri-
butions to the murder
of orangutans include
hunting and the logging
lost in the period being
studied – an average of 17
animals a day. To put this
into perspective, it would
similar to losing the entire
population of Lincoln in
the same amount of time.
Only around half of
Borneo’s original forest
cover remains, constrict-
ing wildlife to smaller
and tighter patches of
suitable habitat. Where
the forest stops, the
plantations begin. This in
turn is another cause of
conflict as orangutans are
often shot when they enter
fruit and crop plantations,
where they are seen as
a major raiding pest.
Declines such as these
are unprecedented in a
natural system without
anthropogenic pressures,
and it will take some
time for the orangutans
to recover if a suitable
recovery programme can
be established. Like us,
they are slow to mature,
although they are not as
social as other great apes
such as chimpanzees. If
the current loss of the
forest and orangutans
continues then there is a
very real likelihood that
they will be extinct within
our lifetimes.
Orangutans share ap-
proximately 97% of their
DNA with us, and their
name literally translates
into the “man of the
forest” in Malay. They are
similar to us in so many
ways but are also unique
in their own right too.
This raises the question:
why do we not show more
compassion for these
awe-inspiring beings?
Collaboration, outreach,
and education are the only
conceivable solutions
we have for conserving
these magnificent beings
for future generations to
marvel at. Moving away
from using products that
contain palm oil is just
one of the ways that you
can help to reduce your
impact on orangutans.

Slicing through the fat: fighting against diabetes

oo many of us
remain attached
to electronic
devices, hood-
winked into thinking that
we are the exception to
injury or disease. With
increasingly captivating
online entertainment
facilities, high calorie
food, and a huge swell of
procrastination, the 21st
Century has vastly altered
the human health para-
digm. This environment
is the perfect breeding
ground for diabetes to
develop.
Diagnosis of diabetes
has more than doubled
since 1996. Type I
diabetes is caused from a
total lack of pancreatic-in-
sulin production, while
type II diabetes stems
from decreased insulin
production or insulin
insensitivity in other cells.
Insulin is responsible for
signalling glucose uptake
from the bloodstream and
storing it as glycogen.
Dysregulation of insulin
production leads to
disrupted blood-glucose
control as glucose remains
in circulation, unable
to enter the cells and
leading to a whole host of
problems, such as inflam-
mation. Historically the
disease has always been
thought of as chronic, pro-
gressive, and irreversible.
However, the promise of
a cure for type II diabetes
seems tantalisingly close
at hand.
Biliopancreatic diver-
sion has been a common
surgical treatment for
obesity since the 1920s.
blood. However, it is only
recently that its impact
on reducing diabetes has
been noted. Amazingly,
clinical trials conducted
on hundreds of patients
in the last few decades
reveal that GI surgery is
the most effective method
of combating diabetes:
Professor Francesco
Rubino and colleagues at
King’s College London
reported 89% of treated
people where managing
the disease through diet
and exercise alone –
without the need for any
further therapy!
These incredible results
have been narrowed down
to five phenomena:
1. Hunger-induc-
ing hormones, such
as Ghrelin, which are
primarily produced in
the GI tract, are unable to
exert an effect to the same
degree due to reduced
concentrations.
2. Surgery raises
circulating bile acid con-
centrations, which helps to
increase the breakdown of
lipids and glucose in cells
and thus dampen down
prolonged blood-glucose
spikes.
3. The microbiome
(the population of mi-
croorganisms that live in
your gut) is also affected,
reducing inflammation
and increasing insulin
sensitivity.
4. Increased sensi-
tivity of the mechanism
by which the gut detects
changes in glucose con-
centrations and relays in-
formation to the brain for
the suppression of glucose
production in the liver
allows the vagus nerve
to stop gluconeogenesis
earlier.
5. Finally, glucose
transporters in the intesti-
nal lining are responsible
for glucose uptake having
decreased activity. These
transporters require
sodium to transport
glucose into the cell.
Surgery bypasses the
primary sodium sources in
the digestive system (e.g.
from pancreatic juices) re-
sulting in lowered glucose
uptake.
Further research is
underway to identify if
other mechanisms remain
hidden away, although
the effectiveness of the
treatment has already
been noticed. In 2016, 45
medical societies enlisted
GI surgery as the standard
diabetic treatment, laying
the groundwork for
crucial steps forward in
opposing type II diabetes
and obesity.
