Record number of sabbatical candidates, amid poor
post-graduate job market
HANGMAN
The number of
candidates has
soared, as people
realise it’s easier to
get a job at ICU than
KPMG.

T
his year has
seen a record
number of stu-
dents running
for paid sabbatical
positions in the Lead-
ership Elections, as the
job market continues to
contract.
Overall, more than
30 students are running
for the seven positions,
which include Union
President, Deputy Pres-
idents, and Felix Editor.
It is one of the highest
turnouts in recent history,
job market which has seen
graduates finding it harder
to land a job when out of
university.
Adam Karney, Imperial
College Union’s Head of
Democracy Extension,
told Hangman that
the increased number
of candidates were “a
clear win for student
democracy, and not a
reflection of the inability
of materials students’
inability to land jobs in
consulting”. Speaking to
Hangman, he said: “these
results are historic, and
show just how much our
students are committed
to deepening democracy,
amplifying the student
voice, and getting paid a
very generous salary for
a role where there is very
little oversight and you
leave office before anyone
can take you to task on the
told Hangman: “I’d hoped
to have a series of jobs in
the investment banking
industry lined up, but I
spent my summers back-
packing around South East
Asia to make up for my
lack of personality, and
didn’t have any unpaid
internships to pad out my
CV. With my prospects
looking gloomy, I thought
I’d put my hat into the
ring for a sabb role; from
the looks of things this
one is mainly about telling
students to make SACAs
nominations.”
While some might have
expected the change in
payment from GBP to
Yoyo points (as reported
in last week’s Hangman)
to have put some students
off running, it seems to
have only increased the

candidate pool. Janet
Beck, a MSc student, said
the change was what had
prompted her to run: “I’ve
just been telling everyone
I’m being paid in crypto-
currency, and now they
think ICU is some kind of
super cool start-up, rather
than the place people go
to for curly fries.”
Other reasons students
gave for running for sab-
batical positions included
“I hear you get to use the
Student Activities Centre
printers for free”, “I didn’t
get past the interview
stage at McKinsey”, and
“I genuinely have nothing
better to do with my time.”

“One possible
explanation
for the
surge is the
increasingly
competitive
job market” things you haven’t done.”
Speaking to candidates,
however, revealed a differ-
ent picture; Sarah Pliner, a
final-year biologist who
is running to be Deputy
President (Edutainment),
with all positions being
contested. One possible
explanation for this surge
in candidates may be the
increasingly competitive
“One
candidate
said she
was running
for the role
after failing
a McKinsey
interview”

Heavy snow has
rekindled memories
of childhood amid TFL
hellscapes.

Editor-in-Chief
H
eavy snow-
storms that
coated Lon-
don this week
brought a small sense of
short-lived joy to Impe-
rial students.
Students were seen
taking selfies in the snow
on their way into lectures,
stopping in for hot choco-
late at the library cafe, and
generally welcoming any
change to the routine that
breaks up the monotony
of everyday life.
Student reaction to the
snow – which brought
a host of problems with
travel and transport, but
also rekindled small
sparks of childhood joy
and nostalgia – was mixed.
Tom Marks, a first year
bioengineering student,
told Hangman: “When I
looked out of my window
this morning and saw a
fresh crisp blanket of pris-
tine snow, it reminded me
of my childhood in rural
Wales, where I’d spend
snow days at my grand-
ma’s house, sipping cocoa
and watching CBBC. I
soon realised that snow
as an adult just means
getting stuck on a packed
District Line train for
35 mins while you wait
for a platform to clear at
Earl’s Court. Yet another
memory of my granny
ruined.”
James Karnet, a third-
year materials student,
also had a mixed reaction:
“It was snowing pretty
hard while I had a break
between lectures, so I
went out to Dalby Court
and drew a giant penis.
It was pretty funny, but
then I remembered I’m
going to graduate with
over £50k in debt, and
everyone in my group
project is a narcissistic
megalomaniac, and then I
felt sad again.”
Students and staff who
are concerned about the
possibility of an overdose
of whimsy are advised to
take solace in the fact the
majority of the snow has
turned to horrible grey
slush.

Snowstorm brings short-lived happiness to Imperial
students
This week your rent at
GradPad means you have
no money for food. You
resort to licking crumbs
out of your microwave
oven.
This week you’re on
the hockey team, and
you’re looking forward
to Hockey Varsity! Oh,
wait…
This week you run a
joke campaign for Union
president, centring
around VKs. You win in a
landslide.
This week you’re the
College, and your plan
to alter the weather and
drive out the picket lines
has gotten out of hand.
This week you’re a Union
hack, and you can’t wait
for elections! Finally, a
topic you can fall back on
to hide your chronic lack
of chat.
This week you become a
scab, crossing the picket
line to pick up lunch from
Fusion. Fair enough.
This week you’re an
election candidate, and
you’re looking forward
to a well-run student
election! Oh, wait…
This week you’re TFL,
and you’re looking
forward to running a
good service in the snow!
Oh, wait…
This week you take a
break from endless lab
reports to catch up with
an old friend: pure grain
alcohol.
This week you fall in the
snow and can’t get up.
Well, you can, but you
really can’t be bothered.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
the pressure of being the
most-read section of Felix
is starting to get to you.
