Huel: An ingenious solution for modern life,
or the 21st­
-century workhouse gruel?
Hint: it’s the latter. This week Grumpy Bastard has a lot to say about Huel, and why it will doom
humanity

T
his week I’ve
been feeling
C h r i s t m a s s y,
which is to say
vindictive and hateful.
It’s probably due to the
snow falling all over
campus that everyone is
endlessly posting pictures
of on every form of social
media they can access. No
one is going to get snowed
in or freeze to death,
which is all the worse
for the College in light
of the strikes. The sudden
snow flurries at this time
of year is incontrovertible
evidence that Alice Gast is
an evil ice witch, hellbent
on using her powers to
prevent staff from obtain-
ing a fair pension deal.
Think Frozen, but with an
inability to freeze the only
thing that matters: her
remuneration package.
Anyway, moving on,
this week I have been
confronted with the
monstrosity that is Huel,
as one of my friends has
started brandishing his
bottle as a replacement for
lunch. As with all those
that have recently adopted
a food fad, they decided
that they immediately had
to convert me to their way
of life, by simultaneously
exalting their new unpar-
alleled existence and den-
igrating my own. Imagine
a pushy vegan, but one
that only eats one thing.
Huel is described on its
website as “Nutritionally
complete food, simply de-
livered.” This I agree with,
if you want your nutrition
delivered with a side of
self-hate. Drinking Huel is
like choking down a grey
soup of misery, because
it is in essence just work-
house gruel for the 21st
Century. This is probably
why I am surprised that
it has become fashionable
with those of middling
income as condemning
people to consume col-
ourless, flavourless liquids
is normally the preserve
of the ruling classes, or
those enduring futuristic
dystopias. I still don’t
understand why they offer
different flavours: as the
saying goes, you can’t
polish a turd.
Huel as a foodstuff is
consumed as a time saving
measure, to increase the
efficiency of human life
and reduce the amount of
time spent preparing and
eating food. As an ardent
traditionalist, the idea
of making our lives ever
more efficient can result in
only one inevitable trend.
The removal of the work
lunchtime, or the space in
the day that all employers
have been obliged to give
their workforce since
the beginning of time.
By allowing Huel to be
adopted across the whole
spectrum of society, we
face the prospect of being
given the barest amount
of time to add the powder
to our Huel branded
shakers, before adding
water, shaking it around
and chugging it down in
a bare 5 minutes. This
should obviously be com-
pleted while wearing the
Huel branded T-shirt that
they send out as part of
their insidious advertising
campaign.
What I’m getting at is,
asusual,thatwhoeveruses
this product should feel
unbearable, soul-crushing
guilt, as they are going to
“Huel is
going to ruin
lunchtimes as
well as tasting
terrible”
totally ruin lunchtimes, as
well as subject the rest of
us to a flavourless future.
In the name of inefficien-
cy, I beg you to dispose
of your Huel branded
shakers, and send this
blind futurism where it
belongs: back to the smug
Scandinavians.
