Are things
getting better or are we
approaching a darker
period of human his-
tory? In his new book
Enlightenment Now: The
Case for Reason, Science,
Humanism, and Progress,
American cognitive
linguist Steven Pinker
makes the case for a more
positive outlook for the
future of humanity.
His argument is mainly
based on one thing,
namely a recollection
of the four pillars of the
enlightenment: reason,
science, progress, and
humanism. Pinker has
been a strong advocate for
all of them for many years.
Today the principles of
the Enlightenment laid
out by thinkers such as
Kant, Voltaire, and Hume
have become part of the
public mindset and their
ideas are so ingrained
into people that the actual
original ideas have faded
into the background.
Therefore, Pinker
argues, it is necessary to
reformulate and remind
ourselves of all the values
the Enlightenment stands
for. Humans are not natu-
rally rational animals, but
through the establishment
of rules and norms, de-
mocracies and markets,
laws and constitutions, a
free press and scientific
societies we are capable
of living up to the ideals
of the enlightenment.
“Are things
getting better
or are we
approaching a
darker period
of human
history?”
“Progress
has been
happening
continuously,
but that it is
certainly not
inevitable”
One of the four pillars
Pinker mentions stands
out: progress. In contrast
to all the others, he points
out, progress is meas-
urable and the question
of whether the world is
seeing progress and is
becoming more enlight-
ened can be subjected to
scientific scrutiny. And
this is exactly what fills
most of the book: statistic
after statistic from all
sorts of areas from wealth
and health to death by
poisoning, one of the very
few negative trends he
mentions. All of them are
associated with what most
people would call progress
of some form and are
presented as the objective
proof of the effect, which
the enlightenment has had
on our lives.
The issue is that modern
intellectuals hate progress,
Pinker thinks, and accuses
the pessimistic attitude of
a lot of academics, which
resonates with the media,
of leading people to focus
on the negative aspects of
progress.
The key question, of
course, is whether all this
is just a feeble attempt to
distract us from problem-
atic trends or whether it
is actually a good ground
for optimism. It is neither,
I would say. Saying that
Pinker turns a blind eye
to any of the issues the
world faces today would
be too easy. After all,
he does stress the point
that progress has been
happening continuously,
but that it is certainly not
inevitable. Neither can he
be accused of mindless
optimism; optimism yes,
but in no way mindless
since he does his best to
back up his claims with
empirical evidence.
What he perhaps does
fall foul of is a guile-
less projection of what
happened in the past onto
the future. Events, trends,
and developments that
happened in the past under
certain circumstances
might not necessarily
happen in the same way
in the future, even if the
circumstances remain
unchanged. In general, his
argument is surrounded
by a hands-on buckle-up
“yes, we can” mentality.
Sure, climate change
poses a huge challenge,
but we can deal with it
and if we just try, progress
in all its various mani-
festations will eventually
sort it out. His scientism
and unbeatable faith in
science in this sense are
obvious.
So, are Pinker’s
arguments reconcilable
with the less optimistic
worldviews of many other
public intellectuals and
the increasingly pessimis-
tic feelings of the general
public? I think they are.
Obviously, Steven
Pinker does not expect us
to break down and shed
hot tears of joy as we
marvel at the wonders we
humans have created. I
think it is about a shift in
perspective, maybe even
just a very slight shift.
As Pinker argues, there
is no point in completely
disregarding all the
evidence for positive
change. On the other
hand, it is wrong to think
that science and reason
will sooner or later solve
every problem that
humanity has and will
encounter. What we need
is to rediscover all the
great things that happened
as a result of the enlight-
enment and that is, I think,
what Enlightenment Now
aims to do. It is a gentle
reminder for people who
are fed a diet of bad news,
that progress is happening
and that so far, in spite of
war, famine, and disease,
humanity has managed to
set up a framework, that
makes a better future a
genuine possibility.
