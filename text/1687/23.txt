Hi, Iâ€™m James and in the last three years I
have spent two as Snowsports President,
and this year as Sports (ACC) Chair. I
know that Clubs and Societies are one of
the most important and heavily involved
aspects of your extra-curricular activity
at Imperial, yet there are not adequate
resources available to support you. I have
seen these problems first hand, currently
being responsible for over 50 clubs, and
believe I have the experience and know
how to find solutions and make it easier
to run a student society. EXPAND ETHOS
