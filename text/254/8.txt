The A s s o c i a t i o n of S c i e n t i f i c Workers was formed by groups
of s c i e n t i s t s i n the year 1918. I n World War One groups of
s c i e n t i s t s were formed w i t h i n government s e r v i c e f o r the f i r s t
time i n h i s t o r y . No-one i n the Government r e a l l y knew how science
c o u l d he used nor what s c i e n t i s t s should he p a i d . When the
s c i e n t i s t s r a i s e d the q u e s t i o n of reasonable hut h i g h e r s a l a r i e s
t h e y were t o l d that the Government only n e g o t i a t e d on s a l a r i e s
w i t h a Trade Union and so the s c i e n t i s t s formed such* a Trade
U n i o n .
Prom 1918 to 1939 the A s s o c i a t i o n campaigned c e a s e l e s s l y
f o r s c i e n t i s t s and engineers t o r e c e i v e decent s a l a r i e s and

S c i e n t i f i c Committee, which brought Science to M . P . r

i n Parliament t o make i l l e g a l the award of spurious science
degrees by commercially minded i n d i v i d u a l s . There was, f o r
example, one l a d y who, i f $ft& approved o f y o u _ a f t e r an i n t e r v i e w ,
would award you the D . S c © ( L o n d o n ) .for a fee of 3 g u i n e a s • In 1936
the A s s o c i a t i o n made i t s f i r s t r e p r e s e n t a t i o n t o D . S . I . R . on

but f a i l e d because the Government thought that such a sum w£.s much

During World War Two the. A s s o c i a t i o n campaigned f o r the use
of science i n war and i n the peace t h a t would f o l l o w . Many of the
post-war p a t t e r n s i n the development of s c i e n c e and technology
f i r s t emerged from conferences organised by the A . s

the A s s o c i a t i o n produced as a Penguin the f i r s t attempt to prepare
a s c i e n t i f i c p l a n f o r the. development of B r i t a i n combined with
a r a p i d increase i n science and technology s t u d e n t s . It may seem
strange i n 1968, t o r e a l i s e , that just* over 20 y e a r s ago there had
t o be a campaign f o r the r a p i d i n c r e a s e i n the number of such
students and for the r a p i d increase i n the amount o f money spent
on s c i e n t i f i c researphand development. It was only 10 y e a r s ago
t h a t the f i r s t governmental, surveys were c a r r i e d out t o determine
how much the country was spending on s c i e n t i f i c r e s e a r c h and how
many s c i e n t i s t s 1
and* t e c h n o l o g i s t s there were.
In the past t e n years the A s s o c i a t i o n , w h i l s t d e a l i n g day
