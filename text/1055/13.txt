noisy popt-
album: rage against the
machine - evil empirevik
Rage Against The Machine hardly need an intro-
duction. Their debut album was a wrecking-ball
of aggression driven by Tom
Morello's incredible array of
guitar sounds and Zack de la
Rocha's indignant rap vocals,
while 'Killing In The Name'
became every rock-club goer's
stomp anthem. Perhaps in view
of having a lot to live up to, it
has taken them three years to
release the follow-up, although
apparently it only took them
about three weeks to actually
record it. The trouble is that in
some places it shows...
'People Of The Sun' and
recent single 'Bulls On Parade'
open things in fine style and
showcase the new Rage sound - one that still
hinges around Morello's guitars and de la Rocha's
anarchistic stance, but which is now less riffy and
more percussive. The latter song, in particular, is
where they get it just right, where the emotional
pressure is allowed to slowly rise until the seal
breaks and the song explodes into one of those
cataclysmic finales that this band are so good at
delivering.
The problem is that from here
on it all gets, well, a little pre-
dictable. From 'Vietnow'
through 'Revolver' and on to
'Year Of Tha Boomerang' it's
the same formula and one that
hardly needs repeating.
Although there aren't any bad
songs there is a conspicuous
absence of memorable
moments resulting in a homo-
geneous mass of slighdy tedious
aural anger.
Although I'm sure that the
energy of their forthcoming live
shows will more than compen-
sate for the quality ot the songs,
I can't help feeling that they're going to have do
something new and a bit quicker than it took
them to do this. (6)
-gig: ruby+red snapperEA
The recently refurbished, 'ultimate' concert
venue of U L U was sold out weeks in advance and
was packed with people eager to see Ruby's first
gig in London. The DJ, Dean Thatcher, did an
excellent job of warming up the crowd with a
selection of jungle anthems and house tracks, and
Ruby came on to a warm
reception.
Ruby's excellent album,
'Salt Peter', was a landmark
in the ever-expanding land-
scape that is trip-hop. It was
essentially the work of
Lesley Rankine together
with a bunch of producers
and programmers. In other
words, it was very much a
studio album and so it was
always going to be difficult
to translate the songs to a
live environment without
simply singing along to taped
backing tracks, a route was
thankfully avoided.
The band played well
enough. The familiar sam-
ples were present and cor-
rect and the songs were
there, but I failed to be moved by the whole expe-
rience. Lesley was obviously keen to emphasise
that she is no longer the boot-stomping 'grrrl' that
fronted Silverfish, but the one thing missing was
the anger and the sheer intensity that makes
Ruby's recorded output so moving. Tonight they
sounded like any average rock band, only occa-
sionally rising above mediocrity such as on the
current single, Tiny Meat', which far surpassed
the recorded version.
Perhaps the poor showing was due to nerves.
After all, this is their first gig in the capital,
although they have been playing in Europe since
the New Year. I only hope that they develop
enough to do justice to the excellent material they
have.
Red Snapper, however, were a different ket-
tle of fishQ). After more
classy tunes from the DJ,
they came on and hit an
infectious groove immedi-
ately. For those of you
unacquainted with their
work, it is best described as
'future jazz'. 'Reeled &
Skinned', their album, is a
fantastic voyage through
jazz licks coupled with
dubby, chilled out, trip-
hoppy beats, and that
essential groove. They are
even better live!
The rhythm section was
tight, with the double bass
delivering that extra
dimension. The saxophon-
ist played with great feel,
especially on their hit single
'Hot Flush', which had the
crowd in raptures. The whole band gelled bril-
liantly and even my companion enjoyed it, in spite
of her general aversion to 'dance' music.
Perhaps Red Snapper shone more as a result
of Ruby's lacklustre performance, but neverthe-
less, this band is destined for greatness. Their
remixes of Ruby's album and of Garbage's last
single will only enhance their reputation, one
which they thoroughly deserve.
