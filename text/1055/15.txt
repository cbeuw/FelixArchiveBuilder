Bruce Willis plays Cole, an observer sent from
the future to gather information on the events
which led to the death of 5 billion people in a
viral epidemic, and to trace the terrorist group
believed to be responsible. As Cole is swatted
back and forth through time, he becomes more
certain of the involvement of the Army of the
12 Monkeys, even as his own grasp on reality
starts to decay.
For his doomsday prophecies, Cole is diag-
nosed as a delusional psychotic and placed in an
asylum under the treatment of psychiatrist
Madeleine Stowe. In the asylum he also meets
Jeffrey Goines, an inmate whose father happens
to be a famous virologist...
Bmce Willis is surprisingly good and suc-
ceeds in creating the necessary madman-or-
prophet uncertainty. Pitt gleefully over-acts, his
exaggerated nervous twitches possibly indicating
something more amiss than just a psychological
illness. Stowe is elegant as the disbeliever who is
dragged into Cole's 'delusions'.
The plot is weU-constructed, sidestepping
the possible traps of time paradoxes - Cole's
overseers know they won't be able to change
what has already happened, but they want a
sample of the pure vims in order to find a cure.
12 Monkeys is undoubtedly the easiest of
Terry Gilliam's films to watch but as he was just
the hired hand, his vision was only secondary.

While on a stealth bomber training flight, Vic
Deakins (John Travolta) steals a couple of
nuclear bombs, and ejects his copilot Riley Hale
(Christian Slater) from the plane. Why? He has
been passed over for promotion once too often,
and wants to gets his own back and make some
money by holding the government to ransom.
Hale predictably decides that it's his duty to
stop Deakins, and drags an innocent park ranger
(played by Samantha Mathis) along with him.
The two of them set off across the Utah out-
back, implausibly dodging bullets, helicopter
blades, trucks and an underground nuclear
explosion on the way.
The action set-pieces are really spectacular,
and director John Woo does everything right,
but he's let down by a truly appalling script, with
far too many awful cliches.
Good takings at the American box office
have ensured that Travolta will escape unscathed
by this pretty poor film, but his character is so
over the top that he's no longer amusing. The
film has little to commend it apart from the
action sequences, and the Malteser-melting
Slater. In a similar vein, Mathis is only there for
the delectation of the blokes.
Broken Arrow is a wannabe Speed, but fails
in suspense and script despite being written by
Speed's writer Graham Yost. It's a mindless
action film and as long as you don't expect any-
thing more it's passable.
