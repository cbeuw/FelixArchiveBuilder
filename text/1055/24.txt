Team G o Down
At the end of April, a team of six
went to France to take part, for
the second time, in the Edhec
International Yachting Regatta
held in La Rochelle.
Representing Imperial's cos-
mopolitan image the crew was
made up of Irish skipper (Mark),
three Frenchmen (Charly,
Francois and Eric), two Germans
(Lutz and Eric again) and a
Norwegian (Bjorn).
Tension built up during the
Sunday training, in spite of the
excellent wind conditions,
revealing how difficult it was for
the team to adjust with so little
training.
The general outcome of the
week confirmed that nervous-
ness was justified. Even though,
they finished 5th out of the 12
Whirlpool boats on Monday,
their luck ran outon Tuesday
when an early start disqualified
them. Unfortunately, the English
boat edged over the starting line
before the signal. But the sun
helped them to stay in good spir-
its.
In spite of strong hopes for
the next regattas, they finished
11 th on the Wednesday night
event. The six came back
fatigued at three o'clock in the
morning, their faces betraying
bitterness after twelve hours at
sea. Their fate was no better than
8th on Thursday, and they
brought up the rear on Friday.
Finally, they shattered all expec-
tations by coming second, on the
last regatta, on Saturday. Better
late than never!
Third
Class
A rollercoaster Hockey season
which began in ignominy was
rounded off in grand style by a
cup run and victory over Royal
Holloway.
The thirds began life as a
disjointed throng who showed
little promise of the glories yet
to come. After shedding a little
ballast, the post-Christmas peri-
od surely counts as one of the
most prolific in the teams histo-
ry.
Although our Wednesday
league performances were some-
what lacklustre and Saturday
games yielded only average
results, the infamous and elusive
team spirit was in full force and
threatened to blind teams who
didn't wear sunglasses!
But the real jewel in the
'Ken Army' crown lay in the
BUSA Cup matches. A powered
up team braved the rigours of
R H U L and U C L - where we did
ourselves proud to play the game
of the season and win 3 - 1.
Although the steam train
was eventually derailed by the
superb Brunei U L , the previous
results made us the 'prodigal
sons' of the club as a whole.
A fluke light failure in the
last game may mean we avoid
relegation... but does it matter?
In a season of missed trains,
boat races and lost minibuses the
game becomes perhaps sec-
ondary to the laughs we've had
as a team. K E N ARMY!!!
Chess club reach quarter finals
This year IC chess club
entered a team in the national
handicap rapidplay knockout
competition. Each player plays
the same opponent twice and the
time limit is half an hour for each
player for all moves. We did rea-
sonably well, knocking out a 6.5/8 or as little as 2/8 to go
strong side from Barbican in through to the next round. Our
round 3, but in the quarter-finals team (usually) consisted of Matt
we were knocked out by Piper, Dom Goodwin, Jeremy
Maidstone, who won last year. Davies and Dave Tang.
The handicap system meant that Hopefully we can do better
a team may require as much as next year.
Imperial
Cyclists
Come
Ninth
Once again Imperial were the
only London College to field a
complete team for the national
student championships and
(with some carbon fibre assis-
tance) they put in a good perfor-
mance. Lacking injury-hit Nick
Osborne, the team of Liam
Maybank, Duncan Emery and
Agis Agisilaou competed against
national squad and common-
wealth games riders to achieve a
highly creditable 9th in the team
competition.
Best individual performance
was Liam with a rapid 22 min-
utes 29 seconds (averaging
26.7mph) for the distance,
Duncan came home with 23
minutes 30 seconds (25.5mph)
and Agis, in his first British time
trial, recorded 24 minutes
43seconds (24.2mph) The over-
all winner in the individual com-
petition was Michael
Hutchinson (Cambridge) with
20 minutes 49 seconds (a rapid
28.8mph) (obviously he has no
work to do). Next up is the
national 25 mile time trial in two
weeks. A big thankyou goes out
to the Harlington Trust for pay-
ing for the aerodynamic aid.
