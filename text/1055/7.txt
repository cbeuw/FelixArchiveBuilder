We all know that the fridge is traditionally the hub of
student flatsharing. In a survey of 5 0 0 student house-
holds, the. following - rather odd - results have been
found:
, 70% of students say that the communal fridge is
now the most common cause of student flatshare
disputes.
, 90% of students have had food or drink stolen from
their communal fridge.
, 8 3 % of students have stolen somebody else's food
from their communal fridge.
, 6 5 % students would stock more food if they
believed that it would not be stolen.
, 5 1 % students have shared a fridge with another stu-
dent with 'unacceptable' hygiene standards.
, 84% student fridges contain alcohol.
, 6 3 % clean their fridge at least once every two
months.
, 11% students have never cleaned a fridge.
, 4% students claim that they have made love
against the fridge:
, 4 0 % student fridges are less than half stocked (not
in my hall, they're not).
, 2 % fridges are completely empty.
, 2 1 % students claim that the students they share
with place too much emphasis on a clean fridge.
, 2% students will only share a fridge with another
vegetarian.
, 1 8% students have got their own back on flat-
mates by stealing or spiking their flatmates food.
, 7% students claim they could live without a fridge.
To the right are the 'average' contents of a student

blatant advertising.
Bored of revising already?
Want something to do

take up Halibut Surfing! Eh?
No, I mean; Then why not
write a feature for Felix!
World fame*! Fabulous Pay*!
Offers of Sexual Gratification
From Members Of The
Opposite Sex**! and even a
Cup Of Tea!!!!!
So what are you waiting
for... get writing!
* This is patently untrue.
** Only if you're an open-
minded gerbil called Kevin.
