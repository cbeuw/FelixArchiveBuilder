"Beating the rest by more than two standard deviations": Nick Bradshaw, Mark Pallen, Jim Totty and

The Imperial College team
stormed to victory in this year's
University Challenge, beating the
London School of Economics in
the Grand Final of the BBC2
quiz show. Recorded in October

television until Wednesday this

a bet on themselves winning the
title. Before even starting the
first round they put down £40.00

BY ANDREW SMITH
Sarah White, the current
Imperial College Union
President, has thrown her hat
into the ring for the University
of London Union ( U L U )
Presidential race. If successful,
Sarah will follow that other
well-known friend of Imperial
College Union, Ghassan Karian,
as London's Student Leader.
With only Paul Crawford,
Vice-President of the Royal
Veterinary College Union,
standing against her, Miss White
stands every chance of success.
She has been supported by
senior Student Union
Sabbaticals at Kings College,

Highlighting communica-
tion, education funding and
