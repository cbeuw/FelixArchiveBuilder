Maybe you've read the book, you've probably
seen the film and unless you've been holidaying
on Mars you could not have failed to miss the
hype. So now Londoners have their third oppor-
tunity to see the stage version. After starting out
on the fringe, they had a short stay in the
Ambassadors in the West End followed
by a country-wide tour, and have now set-
tled in the Whitehall theatre.
Our guide to Edinburgh lowlife is Renton,
who introduces us to his associates and
haunts. It is the script rather than the min-
imalist black set, which describes the
squalor. There is virtually no plot, just a
stream of loosely connected reminis-
cences which are disgusting and offensive,
but somehow very funny. The small cast
of four leads to some identification prob-
lems, but does include the entertaining
double of the psychopath Begbie also playing
Renton's mother.
If you enjoyed the film, you'll love this, but
be quick: it closes on May 11th.
•play- the prince's play^a™
In 1832 the premiere of Victor Hugo's 'The
Prince's Play' ('Le Roi s'amuse') caused the
French King Louis-Philippe so much concern
with its portrayal of the Prince as an underhand-
ed scoundrel, that the opening night was also the
last night of the run. In the 1990's, we may
expect no such reaction to Tony Harrison's
English adaptation. Many today would no longer
even agree with the Victorian modes of thought
so integral to the plot.
The fact that the script is in verse, while not
overly apparent, serves to enhance the (correct)
impression that the play was written a century
and a half ago, and it is perhaps more interesting
as a historical piece than it is enjoyable as a pro-
duction in its own right. (Unless you happen to
like that kind of thing - and a fine upstanding cit-
izen you would be too, I hasten to add.)
Good performances from Ken Stott (as the
central character the Prince's Jester), and Arlene
Cockburn (as the Jester's Daughter), among
others, provide an evening of fine drama.
However, one feels that many of the Play's most
intense moments are held for too long; while
Victor Hugo possessed many undoubted talents,
perhaps we may accuse him of not knowing
when to shut up.
The sets are very impressive, and maintain
the excellent standard which we have come to
expect from the Royal National. In particular,
much of the stage is water for some scenes, and
it really rains on stage, replete with thunder and
lightning. This is not a play for all tastes, but
under Richard Eyre's direction it is well staged
and well perfoirned.
play - the complete works
of william shakespeare
(abridged) ad i
Time Out says "It just ain't
fun any more" but quite
frankly they've lost their
sense of humour.
Admittedly, the idea is
nine years old, and back in
London after a tour round
the country, but the
Reduced Shakespeare
Company are doing an
admirable job of making
their adaptation of the
bard's entire works still
seem off-the-cuff.
It's all over in 97 min-
utes (so we're told) and in
that time the cast of three
get through all 37 plays -
and that includes Coriolanus as a cookery pro-
gramme and Othello as a rap. It's a complete
piss-take, but a very clever one: perhaps the most
memorable bit is when they get through all the
histories as an American football game. And they
don't just spend the entire second half on
Hamlet, but we get an extra-concise three
minute version, and then 'just one last time', only
backwards.
Any complaints you could
have with the perfor-
mance would only imply
that you were taking it all
too seriously. It is certainly
very silly, and with the
great tradition of audience
participation is more of a
pantomime than a play,
but the humour is refresh-
ingly innocent and fast-
paced.
On Tuesday nights the trio
take a break from toying
with English literature in
order to perform The
Complete History of
America (abridged) in a mere 90 minutes. It's
not quite as funny, and not quite as tight, but hey,
these things are all relative.
