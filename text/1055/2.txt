emphasised her wish to 'improve
communications' but has yet to
clarify h o w she intends to
achieve this.
O n education funding Sarah
asserts that it is 'vitally important
that we plan for the future' and
that we 'safeguard the future of
H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n ' . In a side
swipe at the current President
Sarah emphasies the need to
consider the financial problems
of minority category students,
instead of 'concentrating simply
on home undergraduates'.
Speaking to Felix, Sarah
said, "I'm not planning a career in
politics... but I feel it's time
Imperial got more involved in the
U n i o n , and I feel U L U should
move beyond Bloomsbury."
Sarah believes that her
success in 'bringing together
Imperial's current and future
constituent medical school
unions' will be of benefit in her
prospective role as U L U
President. But the presidential
race has highlighted the rift
between the smaller medical
schools in London and the larger,
more powerful colleges, such
Imperial, Kings College, and
University College London.
Representatives of medical
school student unions are
increasingly concerned that they
are losing influence in the
restructuring of U L U . With
many of London's medical
schools being merged in the next
few years, student leaders feel
that the strong traditions of the
colleges will be lost.
With Paul Crawford, an
influential member of U L U ' s
Medical Group, as Sarah's only
opposition, the contest looks set
to demonstrate the extent of the
split. Caroline Baker, President
of Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School
Students' Union, which is one of
the major constituents of the
new Imperial Medical School,
has nominated M r Crawford.
If successful Sarah would
become the first IC student since
Trevor McDonald to become
U L U President. It is unclear
whether Miss White will follow
in Mr Phillips shoes to the extent
of running for N U S President
next year, and possibly even
becoming a presenter on ITN.

Boat club to appeal
Imperial College boat club have
appealed against Wandsworth
Borough Council's decision to
refuse planning permission for
renovation and extension to their
Putney boathouse.
The club's original proposal
was rejected last November after
local residents, supported by
their M P David Mellor,
complained that the plans would
heighten disturbance in the area.
Since the appeal is unlikely
to be heard by the council until
November, the club have also
submitted a revised plan, taking
local residents' concerns into
account.The boat club are hoping
that it will be considered early
this summer. Peter Mee,
Imperial College's Registrar, said
"We think we have met local
residents objections as far as we
can."
As part of the appeal
process, Wandsworth Borough
Council have sent the discussion
of the plans to a Public Inquiry,
to be heard in November.
College authorities hope to avoid
the costly legal fees this would
entail by submitting the revised
proposal.
Ghostly Albert Hall
A series of spooky sightings at
the Royal Albert Hall has forced
the management to seek help
froma professional ghost investi-
gator.
Frightened staff have been
reporting paranormal activity for
several years, so Chief Executive
Patrick Deuchar decided he had
no choice but to call in Andrew
Green, a civil servant and part
time ghostbuster. Green spent
Monday night in the basement at
the Royal Albert Hall along with
reporters and film crews from all
over the world.
Unfortunately Green did
not spot any uninvited appari-
tions. He complained that he
could not walk across the room
without a television camera crew
following him and that he only
had one hour between 3am and
4am in which he was left alone.
As Felix went to press Green was
revisiting the Hall for another
attempt.
Med staff under threat
Cutting the number of medical
school academic staff is one
option being considered by the
vice-chancellor's medical comm-
ittee last week in order to meet
Government cuts in funding.
Rising numbers of medical
students mean that more staff
will be needed to teach them,
but the amount of money that
the Government has assigned
medical schools over the next
few years means that the extra
staff cannot be recruited. This
has raised fears of a decline in the
standard of teaching and a subse-
quently blight of bad doctors.
Sir Michael Thompson,
chair of the committee, said that
academic training had already
absorbed a 28% cut in funding,
yet the Government wanted
more doctors trained to meet a
shortage in the National Health
Service.
Student debt rises
The level of debt that the average
graduate carries with them when
they leave university has leaped
to £3,000, according to a survey
by Barclays Bank. This is a 31%
increase over last year's average.
The survey found that more than
three-quarters of last year's gradr
uates were in debt to the
Student Loans Company, banks,
parents and credit cards.
Interestingly, graduates who
found full-time employment in
their chosen careers had larger
debts than those graduates still
unemployed, mainly due to large
purchases such as a car or
clothes. Also, it was found that
men, with an average debt of
£3,476, had a larger debt than
women who had an average of
£2,414.
The findings are in line with
Government's policy of transfer-
ring the living costs of students
onto the students themselves.
