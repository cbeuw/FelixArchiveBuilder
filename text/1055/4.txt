New degree ceremony low key'
ICU spend £1800 to cancel Commemoration Ball
BY DAVID COHEN
A new slimmer Commemoration
Day experience was unleashed
last Wednesday on Imperial
College. The increasing postgrad-
uate poprdation, currently
amounting to over a third ol the
student numbers, has forced
College to spilt the occasion
commemorating the departure of
Imperial College students.
This week saw the first of
two commemoration days after
the decision to split the event
into ceremonies in May and
October was taken last year. In
previous years, when there was
only one graduation event, the
ceremony usually lasted over
three and a half hours. In a
change from the traditional
performance of the choir at the
October event, this year's musi-
cal interlude was provided by the
Imperial College clarinet player
James Marchese.
Last Wednesday also marked
the inauguration of a new Fellow
of the College, Lewis Warpole.
Famous for his radio and televi-
sion appearances, he has for
several years been actively
involved in an effort to explain
science to the general public.
Warpole encouraged the audi-
ence of new graduates to exercise
a degree of humility when
considering the impact of scien-
tific and technological progress
on • society. This sentiment was
later reinforced by the Chairman
of the Governing Body, Sir Frank
Cooper. The ceremony was
completed in under two hours.
The day's proceedings came
to an early end as the evening's
entertainment, the Commemor-
ation Ball, had to be cancelled
due to lack of interest. With only
forty tickets sold the cancellation
has cost Imperial College Union,
the event's organisers, £1,800 but
this was calculated as being less
than what would have been lost if
the ball went ahead.
Negotiations are under way
to gain compensation from
College's Registry Department to
cover the cancellation fee. With
invitations allegedly being sent
out three weeks after the planned
date, I C U claim that the gradu-
ates did not have enough time to
respond. Others have suggested
that there was simply not enough
interest from postgraduates in
having a ball in the first place. PHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ
Paxman: A very nice bloke'

outside rival team hotel rooms in
an attempt to intimidate them.
Jeremy Paxman, the Univer-
sity Challenge question master
and formidable anchorman of
BBC 2's political review, News-
night, did not pose any problems
for the team. Chris says that he
was a 'very good, very nice bloke',
and that after the final he joined
them in the celebratory drinking.
Mark, 34, felt that he was less
intimated by Paxman because he
was older.'We took the piss out
of him,' he said.
Speaking to Felix earlier this
week, the team were relaxed
about their imminent fame. A l l
team members denied that
winning the final would change
their lives in any way. Mark
commented that University
Challenge success didn't predict
'how good drinkers or how good
lovers' they were, but 'merely
showed that we can win quiz
programmes.'
Excitement was added to the
final rounds as the competition
was held two days before the
captain's wife was due to give
birth to their first child.
Concerned that she might
distract the team if she went into
labour during filming, she
decided to stay at home for the
crucial matches. This anxiety
eventually turned out to be
unnecessary, as Mark's child was
finally born five days after the
filming finished.
The glory is not merely
limited to a half hour slot on
BBC2 as the team has also made
appearances on The Big
Breakfast, Greater London Radio
(GLR), The Evening Standard,
and are booked for an IC
Reporter interview, or P R A V D A
as Jim describes the college
paper. Mark emphasises that
winning has not changed the
team: 'We were always this bad',
he insists.
Festivities following the final
were helped along by plenty of
free beer provided by Granada,
the show's producers. Karaoke
singing to 'We are the champions'
was not especially diplomatic,
but repeating the line 'No time
for losers' did not apparently go
down too well with the inebri-
ated opposing teams.
The team summed up their
experience as 'stressful' empha-
sising how different it is answer-
ing the questions in the studio as
opposed to relaxing at home.
Their total score of f 495 over
five rounds was one of the high-
est ever seen in the tournament,
or as Mark puts it: 'Two standard
deviations away from anyone
else."
