album: the cranberries - -
to the faithful departedaroline
Finally, afewyears and afewmillion years later,
The Cranberries are releasing their third album.
As expected, the songs rely
heavily on the unique voice of
Dolores, which may or may
not be a good thing depending
on your point of view. Her
voice is backed up ably by the
instruments and an increasing-
ly strong percussion section,
culminating in the almost mil-
itary tattoo beating through
'Bosnia'.
This leads on to the fact
that this album is used as a
vehicle for various messages: anti-war in 'War
Child' and 'Bosnia', and touching on suicide and
sexual harassment in 'Free To Decide'. If some of
the profits go towards helping people in these sit-
uations I'll be more convinced...
Nonetheless, the album has some good songs
in the classic Cranberries style, in 'The Rebels',
I'm Still Remembering', and of course the first
single, 'Salvation', which should keep the fans
going until the tour in
December. They have also
tested afewnew ideas such
Vj as a Taize-esque chant in
'Electric Blue', and the rather
Doors-ish organ solo in 'Free
To Decide'. Unfortunately, in
a couple of songs they go
overboard, with the music in
'Joe' and the drums in
'Bosnia' overwhelming the
I voice, destroying the balance
which characterises much of
their other work.
Ultimately, however, this album will be well
received by their current fans and will probably
gain them not a paltryfewmore. (7)
gig: the auteurSn
"Cheers," utters Luke Haines, the king of intro-
spection and pen master of scary lyrics . Is that all
he has to say? "Cheers", I ask you. What next?
The Auteurs recording an AOR record? No
chance. Luke realises his mistake and satisfies the
crowd with some abuse.
As you can tell, this is no normal gig. After all,
The Auteurs are a band who are not really acces-
sible to the kids and so there are no spotty mosh-
ers here (apart from two crazy French girls). To
say that they are an acquired taste is an under-
statement. Described by one journalist as the type
of band "who sound like diey were good at maths
at school" they play music that is in your face,
with the inspiration for their songs coming from
missing children to child brides.
Unsurprisingly, the gig has a unique atmos-
phere. The new album has been out for just four
days and everybody knows the words. There is an
intensity about the crowd that is mirrored in the
band who need to concentrate because the 'tunes'
are hard to play. The crowd sways in near silence
as the band start the set with the tide track from
the new album After Murder Park'. It is then that
Luke utters his "Cheers".
The energy of the band builds through the
gig. They haven't played livefora while and it
shows, but they dig in, and the energy of James
the cellist combined with the hushed tones of the
lyrics brings forth the intensity of the band. As the
set progresses the songs begin to gel and the
crowd sway with greater vigour. By the end of the
gig The Auteurs and the crowd are well satisfied
with the performance. The third encore is a clas-
sic rendition of 'Lenny Valentino', crashing guitars
and crazy lyrics combining to send the gig-goers
home delighted.
