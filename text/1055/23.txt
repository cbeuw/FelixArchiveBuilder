Dear Felix,
I was interested to see your
article about the bookstore last
term. It looks to me as if College
has found another way of stitch-
ing up the students.
The Union Bookshop might
not be the best in the world, but
in theory, at least the profits are
supposed to get spent on us as
students. This isn't going to hap-
pen if a "proper" bookshop takes
over, and you can guarantee
College aren't going to make up
any lost income to the Union, so
we students lose loads of money
that could have been spent by
clubs or societies. And it must be
a sizeable amount of money if
the rent is going to be £60k, and
everyone is still interested in it.
So College gets us a great
deal, it gets £60k rent a year, we
get a posh bookshop with no
guarantee of better service, we
lose another Union service and
all the money it generates and
the services the Union could
provide with the money.
Brilliant. Why doesn't College go
the whole way, get rid of the
nonpaying students, and sell off
all its facilities to the highest bid-
der?
I'd say don't let this happen,
but I don't suppose my opinion
as a mere student matters, does
it?

Suffice to say you are not
alone in your thoughts on this
matter! Profits from the book-
store go directly to pay staff
salaries in the union, money that
would have to be found from
elsewhere if I C U loses it.

All beef used in ICU Catering is only
butchered in E C approved plants, which are
regularly inspected by MAFF/EC appointed
inspectors.
We have not used British beef since
October 1995, and minced beef was replaced
by minced lamb over a year ago.

IC win 'night-in-bar-after-university-
challenge' final
The four Imperial
College brainboxes dominat-
ed the competition from the
beginning, with a quick
starter for ten pints. They
then succeeded in getting
several bonus pints from fans.
They continued in good form
until problems with christian
sundaes slowed them down.
LSE began to claw back,
with 'Hideous Shirt' very
swift with the right arm. But
disaster struck when 'Green
Shirt's stomach gave way and
he was forced to spend the
next hour answering ques-
tions on digestive linguistics
on the toilet floor.
The IC team pulled
through to a good finish, the
only casualty being Pallen,
who an eye witness said "had
problems manoeuvering his
enormous head". Well done,
lads.
