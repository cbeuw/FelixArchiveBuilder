NUS overturns
funding policy
BY MARK BRIDGE
The National Union of Students
has dropped its 16 year long
commitment to campaign lor the
return of student grants to 1979
levels. The policy, decision came
at Easter's Blackpool conference
after a series of concentrated
efforts by various individuals and
groups to bringing about a more
realistic N U S education funding
policy. The impassioned annual
conference attracted a record
1500 delegates, a majority of
whom voted in the new policy.
During the preamble to the
Blackpool conference both the
Scottish and Welsh N U S confer-
ences rejected radical policies
advocating 'demonstrations' and
'occupying buildings to protest'
typifying the sea change toward
less militant positions.
Douglas Trainer, N U S
Scotland President, who
defeated Clive Lewis, N U S
Vice-President, in the recent
NUS Presidency contest rallied
with Scottish Students Assoc-
iations in calling for a policy of
"realism rather than revolution".
Lewis advocated a return to full
grants and free education,
however Trainer won the battle
to lead the N U S next year by
586 votes to 458.
The lobbying group New
Solutions has been credited with
a significant role in bringing
about the changes. Coordinated
by Ghassan Karian, President of
the University of London Union,
the moderate pressure group was
born out of feelings of disquiet
and malcontent after last year's
NUS conference in Derby where
calls for policy reform were
previously dismissed.
Countering the old-style
calls for free education that have
characterised past N U S confer-
ences Karian insisted that "the
policy is unachievable and will
not address the problems we face
- of student hardship, the fall in
quality and the need to increase
access." He marked the occasion
out as being one of the most
important student conferences
for decades.
However, the expedient
vehicle that was New Solutions is
now likely to disintegrate as its
members leave to set up new
NUS education funding-policy
discussion groups. These will
argue out the relative merits of
top up fees, entrance levies and
student contributions.
The decision to no longer
press the Government to fully
fund higher education comes in
the light of increasingly worrying
statistics on the extent of
student hardship.
A newly released survey has
indicated that a third of students
miss lectures because they have
to work in order to remain at
university. The poll of 622
students from a cross section of
different universities around the
country showed that nearly one
half of those in higher education
also have part-time jobs. Of
those that work, more than
three-quarters said that it has an
adverse effect on their studying.

Demolition of the final remaining support structures of the old
Royal College of Science II chemistry building is due to be
completed today, ahead of schedule. Phil Hilton, Schal Project
Manager, said that the preparations for the construction of
Imperial's new Biomedical Sciences building were 'progressing
well'. H e also expressed confidence that the contractors would be
able to make up for time lost when planning permission lor the new
building was delayed.
Sheet piling will commence early next week as the process of
underpinning R C S I begins. In a process expected to take several
weeks, the contractors will construct a temporary retaining wall to
help ensure that the historic chemistry building, which is part of a
recognised conservation area, is not structurally harmed as the foun-
dations for the new building are dug. The next stage of the process,
excavating the basement, is due to begin on June 24th.
IC Radio victim of 'considerable security flaw'
BY JONATHAN TROUT
The newly reconstructed South-
side Disco was broken into last
Wednesday evening. Imperial
College Radio's Jules Taplin and
Rob Clarke discovered the break-
in the following afternoon, find-
ing an SL-1210 Technics deck,
three headshells and a mixer
missing. These items have a
combined value of over £1,200.
It appears that the intruders
were able to walk through an
unlocked fire door, which was
protected by a lockable outer
door before the new Health
Centre building work. The
culprits forced the lock on the DJ
booth and made off with the
equipment, missing in their haste
a £900 C D player.
Ken Weir, Imperial's Chief
Security Officer, stated:
"Security cannot at this time
make much of a comment,
except that the break-in high-
lighted a considerable flaw in the
security of the building.
Temporary measures have been
taken to plug the gap, namely
extra patrols and locks on the
door in question."
Mr Weir also stressed the
need for Southside residents to
come forward with any informa-
tion they may have relating to
this or any other offence. He
further advises anyone with
expensive equipment to have it
properly marked.
