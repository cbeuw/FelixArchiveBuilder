Barnett brilliant at Postbahnhof
Sometimes I sit and think,
sometimes I just sit, and this time
I use side doors. One has to say, it’s
incredibly hard to resist the excellent
noises delivered by a bunch of milk
addicts, and nearly impossible to
pay no heed to an aussie singer-
songwriter who has “severe
allergies, a hint of hypochondria,
and a paramedic brother,” which all
came across as inspiration for the
heart-tickling short story ‘Avant
Gardener’.
Given warning about the crappy
sound quality at Postbahnhof by
a friend from Berlin, I was a little
skeptical at first, but soon we had an
organic apple, a Club-Mate, and got
on the ride – after all, things can’t
go amiss with a Courtney Barnett
show.
The whole place was like a giant
warehouse, where you can imagine
people in cropped Levis, glittery
dresses, and cult ankle-boots
throwing adrenaline-kicking gigs
all night long if it was set up in
London. Girls in baggy jumpsuits,
with natural side swept bangs and
zero makeup, and middle aged men
with less mobile ring fingers will be
something you see at a Courtney
gig, or at least a Courtney gig in
Deutschland.
The show kicked off right after the
support band Big Scary, as the trio
walked in in their habitual deadpan
way. Just as always, the drum beat
intro of ‘Dead Fox’ hit me hard
– a song originating from strong
support for local shops over big
supermarkets, spiced with a touch
of political connotation.
Funnily enough, it reminded
me of another song, ‘David’, from
the double EP, A Sea of Split Peas
(released in 2013), with a smack of
minimalism and environmentalism:
“Come on Davey, let’s go plant a
tree / You bring the spade, I’ll bring
the seeds.”
Sadly I can’t remember the next
one but I am pretty sure ‘Elevator
Y
ou’ve seen the various
memes about Donald
Trump, you know Hillary
Clinton is a shoo-in
for the first female president, and
you’ve watched Bernie Sanders’
rousing speech on socialism, but
you still have no idea what is
going on in the US election. Why
is Bush polling so poorly (No, not
George W. And no, not George
Sr. either. The other one. Jeb!)?
Who on earth is Martin O’Malley?
Is Marco Rubio the Republican
Party’s Obama? Well fret not! Now,
thanks to Election 2016 hosted by
Billy Micou and Varun Mann, you
can keep up to date with the most
important exercise of democracy on
the planet and gain the intellectual
ammunition to shut down that one
social activist friend when they start
running their yap after a couple of
pints in the Union.
Billy and Varun talk through the
week’s global events and their impact
ontheUSpoliticallandscape,backed
up by facts, polls and soundbites, to
provide an intellectual commentary
that Paxman could only dream of.
Critique of both sides is guaranteed,
from Clinton’s secret affair with your
future employers on Wall Street, to
the inane ramblings of Ben Carson,
the hypocrisy of all presidential
candidates is ridiculed both fairly
and concisely. It’s not all high brow
stuff though, this election cycle has
plenty enough fools. Combine this
with the wit of the political duo and
the occasional song, the mood is
kept entertaining – think more ‘This
Week’ than ‘Question Time’.
If listening is too passive for one
as erudite as yourself and you’d like
to have a say on the views spouted
from the deluge of GOP candidates,
or those of the hosts themselves,
Billy and Varun are looking for
guests to discuss particular subjects
for 10-15 minute segments. You
can find their contact information
on the IC Radio website, and make
sure to follow them on Twitter @
icelection2016.
The best political radio show in
SW7 broadcasts live from the West
Basement Wednesdays at 3pm,
and is recorded for your listening
pleasure, at icradio.com.

PC Music go mainstream
I come up here for perception and
clarity… And the wind’s the only
traffic you can hear.” This kind
of celestial feeling miraculously
blended in perfectly with the
background distortion.
“IthinkI’mhungry,I’mthinkingof
you too.” Some late night insomnia,
reminiscing about a skim-read book
on palmistry, and blurry eyes fixed
on the off-white ceiling paint all
intertwined in ‘An Illustration of
Loneliness (Sleepless in New York).’
Courtney then decided to move on
and fantasize: “Wondering what
you’re doing, what you’re listening
to,which quarter of the moon you’re
viewing from your bedroom.” Such
süß loneliness.
The next one rocked us out.
This definitely says a lot about
Courtney’s slacker rocker charisma;
what was a deadpan crowd just two
seconds before suddenly lightened
up when she rattled off the lyrics
from ‘Pedestrian at Best.’And it was
all a rave: “My internal monologue
is saturated analog it’s scratched
and drifting I’ve become attached
to the idea it’s all a shifting dream
bittersweet philosophy.” Bones (The
bassist) went hyper, as too, did the
backup vocalist at that very point.
Slick guitar riffs, groovy bass lines,
radical drum beats. People in the
front rows began to mosh (slightly,
thank god).
‘Depreston’ got to us just in time.
Imagine a two-guitar-chords-
throughout song burrowing into
your psyche and taking root, with
profound narratives and complete
spontaneity. Über Alles. That’s how
I would describe Courtney Barnett
and her crazy clique and their very
best music. They simply know how
to capture the mundanity of real
life subjects and sing about it with
mundane delivery.
Not seeing her at O2 was an easy
decision to make, although I later
had to deal with the pain of taking a
huge amount of time to unsubscribe
from a German event website (and I

anny L Harle’s Broken
Flowers is the first official
PC Music release on
Columbia Records. Up until now
every single or EP produced by
the net label has been available to
download for free online. So, you’d
expect their first commercial release
to be something special. This isn’t the
future-electro that PC Music have
established a cyber-cult around; it’s
radio-friendly music designed and
perfected for mainstream audiences.
Harle has studied pop and distilled
it. He plays with the idea of what
an EP can be, with the last track,
‘Awake For Hours’ a complex and
accelerated remix of the first. They
are different enough that, initially,
you might not notice their shared
vocals. However, in reworking the
song, he adds squeaky, harsh synths,
breaking up the tropical production
of ‘Broken Flowers’ into something
more jittery and impulsive. It’s the
sort of track you might listen to
after five shots of espresso.
‘Forever’ is less innovative. It
begins with bleepy synths, a worn
out staple of PC Music, but is still
immensely addictive. ‘Without You’
slows things down as yet another
unnamed female vocalist sings:
“Sometimes I feel, maybe, this
could be real.” Broken Flowers defies
the sceptics who believe PC Music
aren’t serious. They’re real and no
one makes better pop music.
M
anchester’s Old
Skin’s final release
is a furious, bleak,
suffocating affair.
Originally intended to be released in
the new year on Holy Roar Records,
Old Skin made the decision
in the wake of their somewhat
inevitable break up to release their
recorded album for free. It is with
no exaggeration, however, that this
is Old Skin’s most complete and
ambitious work.
Musically, Old Skin are a very
interesting proposition as they take
advantage of their vocalists deep
percussive vocals by placing them
unusually far down in the mix.
With the vocals sitting alongside
the rhythm guitar, they allow the
lead guitar to provide the mood and
melody of their songs. This works
particularly well on the slower
building tracks of the album, where
the vocals are allowed to come in
late to the songs, adding an urgency
a desperate funeral march drum
beat accompanied by a poignant
guitar line the transitions into a
heavy hardcore section before finally
moving to a thrilling, gang vocal led
closer.
It’s a real shame to see the end of
Old Skin, like previous exciting UK
hardcore bands (Esoteric Youth,
Bastions, and Kerouac) their career
has ended far too soon,but their last
album is absolutely their best work.
It’s a moving, atmospheric and
exciting record.
Out now on Bandcamp
to the building atmosphere.
The title track of this album is
a great example of this. The song
begins with a wall of noisy feedback
and tribal drumming before
introducing dark minimalist guitars,
building up a brooding atmosphere.
The song suddenly switches midway
through,with the vocals introducing
heavily distorted guitars (like Trap
Them level distortion) creating a
pummelling and fierce end to the
song.
The album really showcases the
breadth of Old Skins influences
and sensibilities. There are the
faster aggressive Converge-esque
songs that lead the album, such
as the exhilarating ‘Deadfall’ and
the powerviolence themed ‘Dead
and Gone’, to doomy post metal
influences (i.e. ISIS) showing in
later more atmospheric songs (such
as the creepy ‘Spoil’).
‘Bury me’, the triumphant
closer of the album, demonstrates
this composite style excellently
drawing together the different
facets that Old Skin have displayed
throughout the album. It starts with
