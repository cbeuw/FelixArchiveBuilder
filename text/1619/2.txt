ot saying you’re doomed
if you make a speech
about economics at
Imperial, but chances
are within a week or so you’ll get
some terrible press, and not just
from us. Although a slightly cutting
bottom third of a FELIX front page
is feared throughout parliament
(it’s not even enough to phase
the communications department
here at Imperial) the ‘mainstream’
press have since had a right old go.
Having waltzed around Imperial
within a couple of weeks of each
other, both George Osborne and
John McDonnell have had a rough
time of it lately. A week in the
Business School probably would’ve
taught old Georgie not to play into
the hands of both the right and left
wing press by backtracking on tax
credit cuts, and hopefully would’ve
advised the shadow government’s
counterpart against waving a copy
of Chairman Mao’s ‘little red book’
in front of a room of people you’re
trying to persuade that you’re not a

These very different human
calculators seem to both love it here,
and you can see why. For one thing,
we’re a very reasonably priced Uber
from the Houses of Parliament.
We’ve got technology, a huge and
uncontroversial new campus on the
way, lots of nice science that most
people won’t get annoyed when you
say we should invest in it,clean shiny
surfaces,flashy five-thousand pound
desks, and of course, a student body
tame enough to not occupy whatever
hidden space you’re using (unless
you’re so frightened you resort to
the Imperial West campus, which
of course, even the most fervent
anti-austerity campaigners amongst
us would dismiss as too much of a
treck to protest at).
I’m not saying Imperial breaks
you, but it does.
What am I going to rant about
here when MPs stop using
Imperial’s beloved break out
spaces to launch policies? Or make
dated and misjudged references
to socialism and iPads? Or the
internet? Nothing, so please, write
for us.It could be your stories I could
be making half baked comments
about, forever to haunt my digital
footprint. Lucky you! Have a half
baked comment! Lovely. Please
send full baked comments to us at
felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Much love!
