rom the perspective of
students, peer-reviewed
journals are the front line
of research science and the
pride of the academic publishing
process. However, there has been a
building scandal in the international
scientific community around the
process of peer review. The story
broke into the mainstream when
Springer, one of the world’s largest
academic publishers, announced
they were retracting 64 articles from
across ten of their publications after
discovering faked identities and
email addresses were used to pass
the peer review standards required
by the journals.
Though the 230 papers retracted
in the last three years for this type
of fraud are a tiny fraction of the
thousands of papers published,
there is widespread concern about
the peer review process. Since the
majority of the papers retracted were
authored by Chinese academics,
pressure has been mounting on
China’s research institutions to take
action. “If it wasn’t obvious before,
it is now difficult to deny China’s
research community has serious
underlying ethical issues,” says
Benjamin Shaw, China’s director
for the English-language editing
company Edanz, in Beijing.
China’s central research agency,
China Association for Science and
Technology (CAST), is launching
an investigation of dozens of
scientists involved in the peer-
reviewed scandal that lead to
mass retractions. Additionally,
the Natural Science Foundation
of China announced that if any
retracted paper was the basis of
a successful grant application, all
funding has to be returned in full.
regardless of how much of the
money has been spent. There are
also calls to increase the sanctions
on the authors discredited by such
investigation, to show how serious
abuses of the system are taken. The
Committee of Publication Ethics
(COPE), suggested the problem
also has to be tackled internationally
by increasing the stringency of
publication practices in order to
reverse the tide of manipulating
publishing practices.
The problem is compounded
by the fact that responsibility for
rigged and ghostwritten reviews is
difficult to place at a single person’s
door. “Some researchers may have
innocently become implicated in
attempts to manipulate the peer
review process by disreputable
services,” said Elizabeth Moylan,
senior editor for research integrity
at BioMed Central. In other cases
there is evidence that editors
subverted the peer review process
by recommending articles through
fake accounts. It’s also important
to address the root causes that
lead to peer review fraud, which is
often the peer or perish culture of
modern research. Charlotte Haug,
the vice-chair of the Committee
on Publication Ethics blamed the
pressure Chinese researchers are
often subjected to, saying “We don’t
think that Chinese researchers are
any worse than anybody else. But

China declares war on peer review fraud
Ghostwriters and superstitions arise in the scientific community
what we know is that the pressure
to publish – for example in Western
journals – is enormous in China”.
However, as long as academic
success continues to be measured
by publication in a select number of
elite journals it’s difficult to imagine
how the pressure which drives
researchers to such measure will
end, even if when it’s detrimental to
the wider scientific dialogue.
Is the COP 21 our final chance for action?
World leaders are coming together in Paris next week in what some see humanity’s
ast chance to take coordinated action
Daniel Silva

T
he 2015 United Nations
Climate Change
Conference also known
as the COP 21 is taking
place next week in Paris. From 30th
November to 12th
December, this
will be the single biggest gathering
in history of world leaders with the
sole purpose of agreeing on a legally
binding and universal agreement
that will prevent the world’s
temperature from increasing over
two degrees centigrade from pre-
industrial levels.
After the disappointments of the
last climate change conferences
at Copenhagen and Doha, many
estimate that this will be our last
chance to avert the catastrophe
predicted by scientists if we fail to
substantially reduce greenhouse
emissions over the coming decades.
This agreement must determine the
necessary strategy in which different
mechanisms and policies set the
incentives that allow countries to
move away from from fossil fuels
and into new forms of clean energy
production.
The severity of the man-
made caused situation has been
consistently explained over and
over by climate scientists as the
single most important issue facing
humanity this century, yet we
have failed to take the required
action to tackle this over a number
of constrains. The institutional
stickiness of a polluting system,
embedded special interests from
certain companies, short-termism
on behalf of our politicians and
a tragedy-of-the-commons like
situation where countries have been
free riding on the current state of
affairs are all reasons why we haven’t
acted with the urgency required.The
time to act is now!
In an effort to pressure
governments to take serious action
on climate change, civil society
is mobilizing with marches in
hundreds of cities around the world
over the weekend.
In London the march will take
place on Sunday 29th
November,
forming around 12 noon from
various places and working its way
toward Parliament until around
3pm. Many Imperial College
students will be marching on
Sunday with the university students
block.
Over the coming days, there
will also be a series of seminars,
events and activities including the
Conference of Youth in Paris and
the Climate Games, aiming to raise
awareness on this issue and creating
spaces where people can make their
own contributions.
The world needs a strong binding
agreement that will set the stage for
humanity to shift from dirty fossil
fuels into a zero emissions society.
For a bright and clean future, we
must get this one right.
