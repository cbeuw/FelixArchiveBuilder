The top three
action films
that aren’t
Die Hard
I
love Die Hard. In fact, I’m one
of those people who call it one
of the best Christmas films
of all time. The issue is that I
am banned – as we all should be –
from watching the film until at least
the start of December. Until then,
it looks like we need some other
action films to fill the void:
13 Assassins (2010)
For the uninitiated, Japanese film-
maker Takashi Miike is a lunatic.
Debuting in 1991, Miike-san has
now directed almost 100 films. But
he doesn’t direct crap: Audition and
Ichi the Killer are just two classics
attributable to him.Also unmatched
in his disturbing and gruesome
content,in Miike’s 13 Assassins alone
we see disembodiment, torture,
seppuku, and child murder, to say
nothing of the hordes of soldiers
murdered by our main samurai cast.
For plot, imagine Seven Samurai
meets The Magnificent Seven.
Starship Troopers (1997)
I don’t think there has ever been
a film as misunderstood as Starship
Troopers. It’s almost funny watching
people praise the film for what it
isn’t. Behind this seemingly meat-
headed war flick is parody and
commentary on the level of classics
like Dr Strangelove. In this universe
the humans are the fascist invaders
– they’re basically wearing Nazi
uniforms for God’s sake. The action
set pieces are solid, but go into this
movie looking for the right things
and you’ll uncover a hidden depth.
The Raid (2011)
Oh God, is The Raid good. I mean
really good. Best-action-film-of-
all-time good. In all honesty I don’t
need a complex argument to explain
why. The film features Iko Uwais,
a real-life Indonesian Pencak Silat
champion taking on countless
drugged up gang members as he
and his SWAT team ascend a tower
block to reach a drug lord. The
fighting is flawlessly choreographed
and brutal, with every scene here
surpassing what would be the main
set piece other action films.

Is Tangerine a tipping
point for transgender
representation in
cinema?
O
n 9th
June 2014,
American actor Laverne
Cox became the first
transgender person
to appear on the cover of Time
magazine. Statuesque in a deep blue
dress, Cox’s face, framed by flowing
tresses, stares deep into the viewer’s
eyes; to her left, the title of the lead
article is written – The Transgender
Tipping Point: America’s Next
Civil Rights Frontier; it is a direct
challenge, a confrontation for those
who stand in the way of trans rights.
And out of all who could lead the
charge, Cox is an exemplary choice:
best known for her portrayal of
transgender inmate Sophia Burset
in the wildly popular Netflix show
Orange is the New Black, Cox has
brought the issue of transgender
representation to TVs, laptops, and
tablet screens all over the globe. Her
character is resilient, sympathetic,
and – most importantly – a well-
rounded representation of trans-
identity. In a cultural medium that
prefers to deal in tropes, Cox isn’t
just adding her view. She’s changing
the conversation.
It seems Time is correct:
transgender rights really are the
next frontier, at least in America.
With high profile transwomen
like Janet Mock and Juliet Jacques
encouraging transgender people to
take control of their own narrative,
it appears that we are waking up to
trans issues.Of course,no discussion
of the contemporary transgender
landscape can be complete without
a mention of Caitlyn Jenner, the
former Olympian whose coming
out earlier this year – to borrow a
phrase most associated with her
stepdaughter – broke the internet.
Whether or not you agree with
Jenner’s support for a Republican
party that continues to be oblivious
to trans rights, or believe that
her narrative detracts from the
experiences of low-income trans
says “There’s not just one trans
story. There’s not just one trans
experience,” and yet in terms of
mainstream films we seem to be
getting the same thing, over and
over again. The first problem we
can identify is that there is a severe
dearth of films featuring transgender
characters. GLAAD, a US-based
organisation monitoring LGBT+
representation in media, regularly
publishes its Studio Responsibility
Index (SRI), which ranks the major
motion picture studios in terms of
representation. In 2013, only two
films released by major studios
featured transgender characters;
in 2014, major studios released
no films containing transgender
characters.
This lack of representation is
obviously shocking, but it becomes
even more of an issue when we
consider the wider implications:
41% of trans people in America
have attempted suicide, including
Cox – “I went to the medicine
cabinet and got a bottle of pills.And
swallowed them. And went to sleep,
hoping not to wake up,” she said
in Time. One of the major triggers
for this behaviour is a feeling of
extreme isolation – the idea that
no-one out there can understand
what you’ve gone through. In light
of these findings, the necessity of
transgender narratives is obvious.
But then we have our second
problem: many films and TV
shows that do feature transgender
characters feature them in a
negative light. Another GLAAD
report, looking into transgender
representation on TV, found that
out of transgender characters, 54%
had a negative representation,
40% took on a victim role, and
21% were portrayed as killers. In
contemporary cinema, transgender
people often feature as the butt of
a sexual joke, their existence used
to undermine the masculinity
and heteronormativity of the –
inevitably white, male protagonist.
Films such as The 40 Year Old Virgin
and the Hangover series have used
this trope, portraying transwomen
as sexual tricksters, with the
implication that transgender
people are devious, conniving, and
inherently undesirable.
Another alternative open to
transgender characters is that of
the psychotic killer. This trope has a
long history, from Anthony Perkin’s
cross-dressing killer in Psycho,
through to the rampaging murderer
in Sleepaway Camp and Cilian
Murphy’s character in Peacock, who
suffers from dissociative identity
women of colour, it is clear that
trans issues are entrenched in the
limelight.
At least,this is how things seem at
first sight. However, there is a world
where transgender representation
has been repeatedly mishandled:
the world of cinema. Laverne Cox
disorder. As transgender identity is
associated with a sense of danger,
the audience learns to fear trans
individuals, both for their supposed
‘masking’ of their ‘true sex’, and for
their homicidal tendencies.
Such a representation spills out
from the cinemas and TV screens,
and over to the law courts: ‘Trans
Panic’ – the defence that use of
excessive force, leading to assault or
murder, is induced through the fear
of being an object of transgender
sexual advances – has now come
into the legal lexicon. It was used
in the case of Gwen Araujo, a
transgender teenager who was
beaten and strangled to death at the
age of 17 after her gender identity
was revealed; none of the three men
involved were charged with murder.
California has since banned the
defence, but it is still possible to
use it in America’s 49 other states.
The grim reality is that transwomen
have a one in twelve chance of being
murdered in the US, a number
that increases to one in eight for
transwomen of colour. As long as
transgender people are portrayed as
either sexually deviant, a threat to
masculinity, or a murderous force,
things are unlikely to change.
Such a murder provided the
material for perhaps the most well-
known transgender film Boys Don’t
Cry (1999): in 1993,BrandonTeena,
a transman living in Nebraska,
was raped and murdered after his
gender identity was discovered.
Hilary Swank – then a little-known
actor – played Teena, and earned an
Academy Award for her portrayal.
Tender and moving, the film was
described by critic Roger Ebert as
“Romeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska
trailer park”. The casting of Swank
was also generally praised – since
Teena had not been taking hormone
replacement therapy, and had not
undergone any surgery, choosing
a female actor was a defendable
choice.
However, this is not always the
case. In the last couple of years,
numerous films have come under
fire for casting cisgender actors as
transgender characters,most notable
Jean-Marc Vallée’s 2013 film
Dallas Buyers Club, which centred
around Ron Woodroof (Matthew
McConaughey), a ultra-masc rodeo
cowboy who contracts HIV. The
casting of Jared Leto as Rayon,
a drug-addicted, HIV-positive
transwoman met with critical
acclaim – he won an Academy
Award for the portrayal – but also
widespread condemnation from the
trans community. The issue stems
around whether trans characters,
who are in such desperately short
supply, should be portrayed by non-
trans actors.
At a February 2014 screening
Leto was heckled by an audience
member – his reply was that if
only trans actors are able to play
trans characters, “you’ve made
sure people that are gay would
never get the opportunity to turn
the table, and explore part of that
art.” It is a similar defence used
for whitewashing, the practice of
taking parts that historically should
be filled with minority actors, and
using white actors instead, resulting
in an ancient Egypt populated by
Caucasians. But such a defence
ignores the very real challenges
faced by trans actors, who often
only play trans roles: a survey by the
Screen Actors Guild found that for
LGBT+ actors, one third reported
prejudice from directors, casting
directors, and producers. When
transgender actors are denied the
opportunity to play cisgender roles,
to deny them the chance to play
transgender roles seems unfair.
In an interview with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, Vallée
was asked if he’s ever considered
hiring transgender actors for the
part of Rayon; ‘never,’ he replied,
before questioning whether
such actors actually existed. Such
comments, along with Vallée’s use
of masculine pronouns to describe
the character of Rayon all through
publicity of the film, makes Leto’s
casting seem, if not prejudiced, then
at the very least misinformed.
Furthermore, the casting of trans
actors can bring a much greater
sense of realism to trans parts. As
columnist Paris Lees wrote: “for
truly accurate portrayals of trans
people, cast trans actors”. As we
can see with the case of Orange is
the New Black, Laverne Cox has
brought an extra sense of realism to
the role that no amount of method
acting could provide. While Leto’s
performance in Dallas Buyer’s Club
is brilliant, the characterisation
of Rayon is completely two-
dimensional. Steve Friess, writing
in Time, said that “there is no
stereotype about transgender
women that Leto’s concoction does
not tap”. Lees writes that ‘
“Rayon isn’t a person, she’s a
function”, a statement it is difficult
to disagree with, especially when
Vallée stated “I am not aiming for
the real thing. I am aiming for an
experienced actor who wants to
portray that thing.” The ‘thing’ in
question? A transgender character; a
woman who has hopes, and dreams,
and a lived reality like all of us.
And this is why Tangerine,released
two weeks ago,is such an important,
ground-breaking film. Following
two transgender sex workers
roaming around the hell-hole of
Downtown LA on Christmas Eve,
Tangerine’s director Sean Baker
cast two transwomen – Kitana Kiki
Rodriguez and Mya Taylor – in the
lead roles. The film is funny and
lively, with Rodriguez and Taylor
delivering rapid-fire dialogue that
would put world-class rappers to
shame. There are also moments of
extreme beauty and serenity, such
as when Taylor’s character gives
Rodriguez’s character her own wig
following a transphobic attack.
The fact that the entire thing was
shot on an iPhone (and not even
the latest model) is not the most
startling thing about it; instead it is
the extreme reality that Rodriguez
and Taylor’s performances bring
to the screen that make us pause
for thought. Here are two women
who truly understand what the
characters are going through, and
carry nuances in their performances
that make the idea of ever casting
a non-trans actor as a trans role
seem completely nonsensical. There
is a campaign to get Rodriguez
and Taylor nominated for the
2016 Academy Awards; modern
entertainment, the world of cinema,
and the rights of trans people across
the world would be improved if they
succeed.
