FILM
Documentary corner: Indie Game:The Movie
Ben Collier
Film Writer
I
n the last decade or so, the
video game industry has seen
a meteoric rise in success.
Previously seen as a pastime
for nerds alone, the medium is
now as mainstream and popular
as any other. A relatively new
phenomenon is the concept of
the ‘indie developer’; while game
production was previously reserved
for big-budget, AAA developers,
the emergence of platforms such as
Steam, as well as the downloadable
stores on PlayStation and Xbox,
now afford independents a shot at
the market.
Indie Game:The Movie is a fantastic
Kickstarter-funded film that
follows the development cycle for
three such developers going down
the surprising route of describing
the real hardships these creatives
go through to get their games out.
I went into this movie expecting a
fairly broad look at the industry –
what I got was an in-depth character
study of some truly dedicated and
burdened men. At times, the film
is genuinely hard to watch, as we
see what these men have sacrificed
to produce their game. We see
them cut off their family members,
experience depression, and even
break down in parts.
First we are introduced to Edward
McMillen and Tommy Refenes, the
men behind Super Meat Boy – an
intensely difficult 2D platformer
which went on to sell one million
copies.These men – charismatic and
enthusiastic – are the people we can
best empathise with in the film, but
we begin to see them deteriorate as
deadlines close in. We can also see
what their project means to them
– “I made it for myself”, Edmund
explains at one point.
In direct contrast, we have Phil
Fish, who when we first meet him,
had been working on his game, Fez,
for countless years. Somewhat of
an unlikable character, Fish spends
the majority of his time angrily
defending his game from ‘haters’
and complaining angrily about an
ex-business partner. He remains a
controversial figure following the
film’s release and he even cancelled
Fez 2 after an online argument with
a journalist who called him a ‘bitter
hipster’.
The character we sadly spend the
least time with is Jonathan Blow,
whose game, Braid, is the only of
the three featured I have properly
played. It’s an incredibly popular
and intelligent time-twisting puzzle
game and a critical darling.Yet Blow
could well be the most pretentious
man you will ever meet – he is in
equal parts hilarious and totally
insufferable.One of best moments in
any documentary I’ve seen involves
him dramatically lamenting over
reviewers and YouTubers who are
enjoying his game, but not grasping
the depth of his artistic vision.
Despite all this though, Blow is still
a deeply intelligent creative, who is
genuinely fascinating to listen to.
What all these stories amount to
is a fantastically well put-together
and honestly quite emotional
film. We really begin to feel for
these developers, as we see some
of the things they had to sacrifice
for success. Even if you’re not a
particular fan of video games, Indie
Game:The Movie raises sad questions
about whether the appeal of artistic
freedom and chance of success
in this medium are even worth
the struggle – I wholeheartedly
recommend it.

The unstoppable march of the YA dystopia
W
hen the first Hunger
Games film was
released back in
March 2012, I was
still in secondary school, preparing
for the end of my final year and the
subsequent upheaval of moving to
university.It was either that summer
or the summer before that that I
sat down and devoured Suzanne
Collins’ YA trilogy, racing against
the looming deadline that would see
me make my transferral to the adult
world where I would put away my
childish things, no longer having an
excuse to read fiction aimed at an
audience several years younger than
I was at the time.
Now, here we are, three and a half
years later, and the final instalment
of the series has just been released:
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay –
Part 2, again marking the end of
an era. Many of those my age have
left higher education, and are now
taking their first tentative steps into
the ‘real’world, living out their Lena
Dunham-esque fantasies of rising
rentpricesandinsecureemployment.
In that time, the cultural landscape
has shifted beneath our feet; where
once vampires and wizards were par
for the course in Young Adult (YA)
fiction, now dystopia is king.
The last three years have seen a
proliferation in dystopian fiction
whose film adaptations approach
with a sense of weary inevitability.
The last year alone has seen films in
The Hunger Games, Divergent, and
Maze Runner series, all of which
feature plucky teens facing an
oppressive power structure helmed
by adults. Of course, dystopia has
been a popular genre for years, with
Brave New World, 1984, and The
Handmaid’s Tale all leaving their
marks on impressionable young
minds. What seems different now is
the pace with which new books and
films are released,which has reached
an almost oppressive onslaught.
Surely this bubble soon must pop,as
teens, shot through with fickleness,
move on to the next big thing.
The trend, however, only seems to
be increasing.At the time of writing,
the latest of The Hunger Games films,
in cinemas barely a week, has taken
nearly $250 million. The other
series are also in ruddy financial
health: not a single film from The
Hunger Games, Divergent, or Maze
Runner series has failed to make a
substantial profit. The first Maze
Runner film, made on a budget of
$34 million, took more than ten
times that in box office takings; The
Hunger Games series has grossed
around $2.5 billion. While critics
may be largely ambivalent about
the films, the public is lapping
it up as the films garner MTV
accolades, People’s Choice Awards,
and gargantuan profits. It seems
dystopian films are a guaranteed
smash hit.
Why are they so popular, and
why now? Several have identified
the obvious analogy for the high
school experience, an idea that
perhaps doesn’t transfer seamlessly
over to the UK system. Dana
Stevens, writing in Slate, said that
dystopian fiction “externalises the
turmoil that’s already taking place
in adolescents’ minds, hearts, and
bodies”. For Tom Shaw, the brutal
killing in The Hunger Games is
the perfect analogy for the quest
towards perfection and popularity
taking place at schools up and down
the country: The Hunger Games,
Shaw says, “is the story of a girl
who’s voted the homecoming queen
of the world”. While the double-
edged sword of popularity has been
explored by films such as Mean Girls,
Heathers, and Carrie, this new wave
of dystopian cinema seems to be
upping the ante, perhaps reflecting
the increased pressures media
like Instagram and Twitter have
wrought on the teenage microcosm.
For fans of Divergent, the
analogies with school become
even more obvious: set in a future
Chicago, society is divided into
five poorly-named factions, based
on personal traits. Those who do
not acquiesce with the system and
conform to one of the five mind-
sets are ‘Factionless’, and have no
social worth. As Tom Stone in The
Guardian said, Divergent is about ‘A
16-year-old girl trying to find her
place in a world modelled on a series
of frat houses’. In order to survive,
Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley)
must disguise the fact that she is
‘divergent’, placing her light under
a bushel in order to fit in. It’s a
narrative familiar to teenagers up
and down the country who have to
sand off parts of their personality in
order to fit the space they’ve been
allocated.
In contrast, Andrew O’Hehir,
writing in Salon, seems to think that
these books mask a sinister message
about individualism and libertarian
ideals. For him, Divergent and
The Hunger Games are “capitalist
agitprop”, “propaganda for the
ethos of individualism, the central
ideology of consumer capitalism”.
This theory centres around the idea
thatsuchnovelsfeatureanindividual
protagonist who overcomes extreme
oppression (typically in the form of
big government) in order to defend
their right to express themselves.
The upshot of the films, O’Hehir
writes,is that they “remind ourselves
how grateful we should be to live in
a society where we can be ‘ourselves’,
where we can enjoy unspecified
and vague freedoms”. It is an idea
picked up by Ewan Morrison in The
Guardian, who sees the oppressive
antagonists of the films as symbols,
not of power gone awry, but of
states and community which the
individual must overcome in order
to thrive. The Hunger Games, under
this reading, becomes a Randian
struggle for independence, where
social parasites must be killed in
order for the individual to realise
their true potential.
It is true that these series promote
the idea of uniqueness; sitting in the
cinema, the anonymous teen can
identify with the main character
for a few hours, imagining a world
where they have left their suburban
existence behind and become
world-famous. While previous
popular film and book series,such as
Harry Potter and the Twilight series,
feature protagonists thrust into the
spotlight, where the dystopias differ
is in how violent they are. In the
media popular just 5 years ago,it was
enough for the individual to rise;
now, not only must the individual
succeed, but others must fall. In The
Hunger Games, where the pressures
of society force adolescents to turn
upon each other in a ritualised
bloodbath, could we finally have the
YA novel for the post-Columbine
generation?
While such an interpretation
is interesting, it seems a bit
overwrought. The natural tendency
for adolescents to rebel against
authority needs no explanation, so
deeply is it carved into the bedrock
of our collective culture. But there
is something to be said about the
new direction YA fiction and film
has taken, and I personally see it
differentlytoMorrisonandO’Hehir.
That is, as the global recession has
worsened (leading to massive cuts
to the welfare state) the paradigm
shift we desperately need has not
occurred. Instead, what we have
is a doubling down of Thatcherite
policies, and an emphasis on
individual action that comes directly
from central government. Why is it
a surprise that teenagers are lapping
up narratives about how they have
to rise above and defeat their peers
when individualism is the order
of the day and we are all in direct
competition for the state’s limited
resources?
We are currently less than a
year into a Conservative-majority
parliament, and since Cameron
came to power in 2010, youth
services have been decimated:
raised tuition fees mean the
average student will leave university
£45,000 in debt. A refusal to build
social housing has led to a property
bubble where the average London
house is 13 times the median salary.
NHS mental health services for
young people, already stretched to
their limit, have been cut by £35
million. The result: an environment
for young people that is not
dissimilar to a Hobbesian state of
nature – one where life is solitary,
poor, nasty, brutish, and short. The
government tells us that under-25s
don’t deserve the living wage since
they are ‘not as productive’ and all
the while stripping 18-21 year-
olds of housing benefits despite the
fact that 49% of people living in
homeless accommodation are aged
16-24. Not only that, but a recent
report indicates that young people
are most likely to volunteer their
time to serve their local community
with the under 25s spending twice
as much time as the 55+ acting as
volunteers.
We live in a world where the
baby boomer generation holds a
majority of the power.Young people
hold up this system by offering
unpaid labour, be it in the form of
charity or internships, and are made
completely dependent on those
at the top. As the austerity cuts
deepen and social services for young
people are completely swept away
by a tide of ideological economics,
our society begins to resemble a
desperate scramble to the top, a war
of all-against-all.Why should we be
surprised that dystopian fictions, in
hindsight quasi-prophetic, continue
to attract audiences? Dystopias no
longer reflect our worst fears; they
now reflect our basic reality.
