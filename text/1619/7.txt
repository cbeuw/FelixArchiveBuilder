When we’re surrounded by so much fear, we forget that we still have freedom

I
n 1853, the architect Georges-
Eugène Haussmann was
tasked with the renovation
of Paris, a city crippled by
overcrowding and disease. Part of
his work involved creating large,
straight boulevards that critics
at the time said were to allow the
army to manoeuvre more easily
and to suppress armed uprisings.
Whether that really was the
motivation behind them, today we
are regrettably seeing soldiers lining
these boulevards.
The response to the attacks in
Paris has been substantial to say
the least. The day after the attacks,
France mobilised 115,000 soldiers
across the country, while 1,000 extra
soldiers have been stationed in Paris
itself. Closer to home, we have seen
David Cameron pledge £3 billion
for anti-terrorism units, the first
increase in military spending in
decades.
I was relatively unaffected by
all this until recently, when my
hometown of Brussels was locked
down due to an “imminent threat”.
I had been told how surreal the
situation was, but it didn’t quite
hit home until I saw pictures of
the desolate city centre, thoroughly
empty apart from a handful of
soldiers patrolling here and there.
The fear that all this has caused
is hard to exaggerate, and it’s
understandable. Terrorist attacks
are frightening because they are so
unpredictable, and have little care
for who their victims are.They fill us
with a sense of powerlessness as we
think to ourselves, “that could have
been me”.
This shouldn’t divert us from
the fact that these attacks capture
our attention so much because
they are freak events. We all know
this deep down, but what may be
surprising is just how uncommon
these events are. 32,658 people were
killed in terrorist attacks in 2014,
but only a small fraction of these
were Westerners. Of all the terrorist
attacks that have been committed
around the world since 2001, only
0.5% of these have been in the
West (that figure goes up to 2.6%
if you include 9/11). Sensationalism
is sadly the bread and butter of
modern news, and we ignore this at
our peril.
These
attacks
capture our
attention
so much
because
they are
freak events
All the news coverage and
heightening of security creates an
unwarranted atmosphere of fear,
but that is not the only harm that
these measures do.The obsession we
seem to have with terrorist attacks
diverts our attention (and ultimately
government spending) away from
causes that could save more lives
than any city-wide lockdown or air
strike ever could.Because of this,we
have accepted that cuts to police,
education and junior doctors’ wages
are acceptable, while an increase in
military spending can be proposed
without any seeming contradiction.
This winter some 20,000 will die
from lack of proper heating, but
we will not see any proposals to
prevent this because this happens
year on year and it’s simply not news
anymore.
There is also the question of
whether heightening security and
proposing air strikes in foreign
countries (as David Cameron did
quite recently) does anything to
help with the ‘War on Terror’.
This is a hard question to answer.
However, what is certain is that
these measures do more to promote
fear in Western populations than
they do to prevent the supposed
cause of that fear.
This brings me to what I believe to
be the most damaging consequence
of the scaremongering we have seen
in the last decade and a half, and
that is the use of fear as a way for
governments to pass measures that
wouldotherwisebeunthinkable.The
most prominent of these measures
has been the mass surveillance we
have seen with GCHQ, justified by
William Hague in eerily Orwellian
language: “if you are a law-abiding
citizen… you have nothing to fear”.
While there are other examples
of successful infringements
on our human rights, what is
equally worrying are the laws
that have been proposed before
being thankfully struck down. In
2004, the UK government tried
introduce indefinite imprisonment
for suspected terrorists but this
was ruled to be a breach of human
rights. The right to jury trial is part
of the UN Declaration for Human
rights as well as the Magna Carta,
and to see a government try to
take away this right so flippantly is
deeply unsettling.
More recently, we saw Theresa
May propose measures that will
outlaw “vocal or active opposition
to fundamental British values”, as
well a bill that will pretty much
legitimise GCHQ’s activities. This
is a gross overreaction to what I
consider to be a marginal and much
exaggerated security threat. Not
only that, but it opens up the door
to activities that wouldn’t look out
of place in a police state, all the
while with our implicit consent.
We often talk of our human
rights as if they were inalienable,
but history has shown us that we
are more easily stripped of these
than granted them. While it is hard
not to be swept up in the hysteria
that follows from terrorist attacks,
we would do well to remember
this. Above all, we should not be so
easily led to believe that we have to
make a choice between freedom and
security.
