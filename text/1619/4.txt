English degrees cost most on average

...the leader of the OECD’s
Education and Skills department
said that the “returns to individuals
[studying in England] are still very,
very substantial”.
Although British institutions rely
heavily on private funds, students in
the UK contribute around 20% to
the cost of their education, which is
more than the EU average of 14%.
At the moment, Imperial
undergraduate degrees costs £9000
per year for home and EU students,
and £26,000 for everyone else. This
is higher than the OECD’s UK
average of £6000,.
Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the
Sutton Trust, which campaigns
for equal access to education,
said the figures “should cause the
government to avoid steps that could
hamper access, including replacing An artist’s impression. Photo Credit: FELIX

Yoga banned at American university
Y
oga classes at the
University of Ottawa
have been cancelled
by the university’s
Student Federation (the American
student union equivalent) after
apparent concerns over “cultural
appropriation”.
Jennifer Scharf, an instructor who
had been running free weekly yoga
sessions at the university’s Centre
for Students with Disabilities,
claimed in an interview with the
Ottawa Sun that she had been told
via an email exchange in September
that the yoga program had been
cancelled for the upcoming term.
In the email, Scharf claimed
that a representative of the Centre
wrote that “while yoga is a really
great idea and accessible and great
for students ... there are cultural
issues of implication involved in the
practice.”
The email continued: “yoga has
been under a lot of controversy lately
due to how it is being practiced and
what practices from what cultures ...
they are being taken from. Many of
these cultures ... have experienced
oppression, cultural genocide and
diasporas due to colonialism and
western supremacy, and we need to
be mindful of this.”
Scharf attempted to offer a
compromise, suggesting changing
the name of the program away
from yoga and towards “mindful
stretching”,claiming that since yoga
is “not really what we are doing,
we are just stretching”, and name
change would not require a material
change to the classes content. This
compromise was ultimately rejected
by the Federation, and the classes
were discontinued, at which point
opposition to the move began to
take hold in the student community.
In response, the Centre issued a
statement via Facebook, insisting
that “the classes were not cancelled”,

Teacher claims union said ‘cultural appropriation’ meant the classes would be stopped
and were instead temporarily
suspended to allow for “proper
consultation” over the future of the
service.
This consultation is part of a
review of the service, which the
Centre claim is required as during
the “couple of years” the program
has been running it “has never been
reviewed.”
In a comment on the statement,
the Facebook account for the Centre
also added that “no one attended the
classes so that’s why we ended them,
its [sic] not that hard to understand
people, the fact that disabled
people are getting harrassed over
this is ridiculous”, with no further
comment or context available.
Finally, the Federation itself
stepped in to provide an update
(also via Facebook), claiming that
neither the Federation nor the
Centre “release[d] the statements
around cultural appropriation tothe
Ottawa Sun [which broke the story
originally]”, and dismissing the
quotes on cultural appropriation
as falsified. They also reiterated the
claim that “the attendance of the
Yoga classes was declining”and that
the program “has been running for
the past 8 years without any re­
evaluation.”
The statement concludes with
an expression of disappointment
over the “harassment and violence”
some Centre/Federation staff have
experienced over this issue, as well
as a plea to be able to “revaluate
this conversation and have a more
conducive dialogue.”
Excluding private universities, ours are the most expensive in the world
grants for poorer students with
loans leaving them more indebted
than richer students, cutting
widening participation funding, or
reducing the independence of the
access regulator”.
He also said that although home
student fee increases from 2012 did
not seem to have put off students
from poorer backgrounds, “it has
seen a big fall in numbers of mature
part-time students”. Imperial
offers part-time courses in several
departments including Aeronautics,
the Business School and Science
Communication.
In his Autumn statement
published yesterday, Chancellor
George Osborne reiterated plans
to scrap maintenance grants for
students, saving the national coffers
£2bn per year.
The statement also guaranteed
that the wage threshold for home
students having to pay back their
fees would remain at £21,000
until April 2021, which will mean
repayments for the students who
started their studies in 2012 or after
could work out more expensive.
Despite this new research,
the government has no plans
to halt its recent green paper
recommendations, which would
see top universities being allowed
to raise their fees with inflation.
Still in its infancy, these potential
policies are currently going through
consultation, but after the tripling
in fees in 2012, further increases
were predicted by many. Imperial
College Union has not yet taken
a stance on the green paper, and
Imperial College have said they will
be responding to the consultation,
after discussing the issue with ICU.

issues of
implication”
involved in
the practice
