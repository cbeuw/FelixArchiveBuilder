Dinner for lunch
W
hen I first told my
parents I was taking
my girlfriend of
almost two years
to Dinner, Heston Blumenthal’s
Michelin two-star restaurant,for her
21st
birthday, the reaction was one of
shock at my extravagance and wilful
self bankruptcy.Given his ingenious
mix of fantastic culinary sense, mad
science and overall celebrity status,
it’s a true enough assumption that
his restaurant would also set you
back a fair way. With the cheapest
main course coming in at £28,
they weren’t far from wrong, but I
quickly assuaged them with the fact
that the three-course lunchtime set
menu would only be £38 a piece,
which, given the occasion and my
desire to visit this culinary temple, I
was more than willing to hand over.
Ever since I took a serious, career-
based interest in cooking, Heston
Blumenthal has been one of my
inspirational figures, combining
both scientific technique and
gastronomic smarts. My longing
to visit one of his restaurants has
increased year after year. Naturally, I
jumped on the opportunity when it
presented itself this term. Booking
a table was done easily online a
month or so in advance, as we
weren’t heading in for an evening
showing of the culinary arts – the
set menu only runs at lunchtimes.
Then, the long wait began.
I already had one of Heston’s
cookbooks – Historic Heston. It’s
a journey through his amazing
investigation of historic and often
forgotten recipes, combinations and
techniques. Whilst he often derives
inspiration loosely from original
ideas, his end results are very
modern interpretations, and would

not be instantly recognisable to
the authors! I had this in mind
when I had a look at the set menu
the morning of the lunch, and
was pleased to see a few dishes I
recognised. I had pre-agreed with
my girlfriend to each choose a
different option for each course so
as to try the full variety – and it
happened to suit our tastes as well.
We set out to Knightsbridge,
and found ourselves outside
the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.
Weaving our way through the
archways and columns, we were
escorted to Dinner, where we had
a lovely table with a view over
Hyde Park. The décor is fittingly
eccentric, with porcelain jelly
moulds as light fittings, scattered
chilli plants and other oddities.
A charming host presented us
with the menus, and we chose to
have some cocktails – being more
attracted by their adventurous
blends than the (expensive)
offerings from the wine list. With
my rosemary-infused Sargasso
Sea (very refreshing, if almost
too herbal) and my girlfriend’s
Emoliente Sour (she made the
better choice – sweet and subtle,
with lavender that didn’t, for once,
make me think of soap),we ordered
our food and tucked into the
delicious wholemeal sourdough
and unpasteurised butter. It was
bloody good bread, but even my
refined (read: pretentious) palate
couldn’t really tell that it was
unpasteurized butter, though it was
indeed golden and luscious.
Arriving on simple white china,
my ragu of pig’s ears was certainly
not as pretty as my girlfriend’s
lemon salad – a bright, summery
plate of smoked artichokes, goat’s
curd, pickled beetroot and radishes.
The contrast between the two
dishes was apparent – mine, rich
and unctuous, had a hearty slice of
toast underneath that soaked up
all the rich meaty juices. The ears
(yes, offal is off-putting to some
but I try almost anything) had
been cooked to perfect succulency,
and were offset by a slight hint
of vinegar. Caramelised onions
rounded out the whole compilation
of flavours, and I was in heaven. My
girlfriend was just as happy – the
delicate, tangy curd had just the
right consistency to compliment
the smoked artichokes, and crisp
radishes and beetroots leant
refreshing bite to the party. I was
thrilled – so many people, including
chefs who I’ve worked with, said
that I should not set my hopes too
high. Yet, the chefs at Dinner, and
Heston himself, had delivered.
Whilst relatively technically simple,
both dishes delivered bold, punchy
combinations that were what I had
expected. I eagerly awaited the
arrival of our main courses.
Once again, I was thrilled, and
highly impressed. Juicy braised
pork belly, with an umami sauce to
add another dimension of richness
and flavour. It made for a delicious
accompaniment to lightly cooked
hispi cabbage that was perfused
with delicate shreds of salty ham
hock. A leaf of intense herbed gel
intertwined with the cabbage, and
everything was given the most
perfect crunch with some pork
puffs, or deep-fried dehydrated
pork skin, producing some powerful
piggy flavour. Again, relatively
few components, but all flawlessly
cooked. That was the precision I
had been looking for, and it was also
evident in my girlfriend’s perfectly
cooked pollock. A white fish that
has always been reminiscent of
poorly-made school dinner fish and
chips, pollock’s subtle flavour is well
worth the gentle cooking it had
been given. With delicate brown
shrimp, tangy capers and creamy
pea puree (such a vivid green), one
look at her face confirmed that we
made the right choice by booking
a table. Being the greedy bugger
that I am, I hankered after that
little bit more of both dishes, but
was still pleasantly surprised by the
handsome portions of both fish and
flesh. Feeling extremely lucky, both
with my company and the meal, we
moved onto desserts.
Now, I should mention – I am
a savoury man. But even I was
enraptured by the delicate custard
that filled my prune and tamarind
tart, along with crispy, almost
caramelised shortcrust pastry. The
whole work of art was brought
together by the custard’s torched,
brÛléed top – such a crisp, satisfying
skin. My girlfriend loves crème
brÛlée, but was equally impressed
by her bitter cocoa mousse paired
with sweet honey ice cream and a
tangy grapefruit gel. With a subtle
hint of yuzu (a Japanese relative
of the grapefruit) permeating the
chocolate, it offered a very clean,
refreshing end to the meal, or so
we thought. Not so fast – a delicate
post-dessert dessert arrived – and
this was my favourite part. Slightly
salted, a long, thin caraway biscuit
was presented with a tablespoon-
sized portion of an amazingly
rich chocolate mousse, this time
flavoured with Earl Grey. Wow.
This was the flavour combination I
enjoyed the most out of everything
we tried so far. It was rich, yet salty
and crispy – everything I really
enjoy in a pudding – but combining
it with the fleeting, whimsical taste
of Earl Grey put the dessert on
another level entirely. It’s a mixture
I’m going to look into more, and
out of everything was the element I
wanted to replicate the most.
So, having settled the damage,
we left fully content. Whilst
much cheaper than other two-star
Michelin restaurants, Dinner is
not the cheapest place in London
to dine at. However, the standard
of service (which, needless to say,
was impeccable throughout) and
cuisine that you receive, it really is
worth every penny, if not more. I’m
already looking into getting a table
for our two-year anniversary (yes,
we’ll be sodding the cost and going
a la carte).If there’s someone in your
life you want to treat, or if you’re
simply looking to indulge yourself,
don’t hesitate. That being said, I
guess there are some sweet Nando’s
discounts available too.
