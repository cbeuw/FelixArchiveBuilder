The mighty hedgehog will roar
Should we save hedgehogs at the expense of
becoming a global laughing stock?

T
he lion has long been
hailed a most majestic
and fearsome creature.
Respected by the other
animals within its habitat, the lion
has a purpose, pride and courage.
And as far back as the time of
Richard I, the lion has been used
as England’s national animal for
all the aforementioned reasons. As
a nation, we supposedly share these
qualities with the lion, hence the
massive statues in Trafalgar Square,
amongst other places, paying
homage to our national animal.
However it has been suggested
recently that this symbol needs to
be updated and replaced. Trafalgar
square should no longer be filled
with the famous lions, but instead
with giant hedgehogs. Huge, spikey
hedgehogs which no one is going to
be sat on posing for a family picture.
This comes after conservative
MP, Oliver Colvile, suggested the
Hedgehog becomes Britain’s new
national symbol in order to boost
public awareness of the hedgehogs
decline in numbers. In the last ten
years alone, their numbers have
decreased by almost a third due to
a loss of habitat. Certainly this is
an issue that needs to be discussed,
but whether it hold the gravitas to
change our country’s whole identity
is debatable. And surely there
must be better ways of helping the
hedgehog than putting it on our
passports and England football
shirts.
Ideas such as creating ‘specialist
habitats’ with new housing, and
making holes in garden fences for
the hedgehogs mobility would
make a huge difference. This
alongside efforts of wildlife trusts
could curb the decline of hedgehogs
in the UK. Therefore, reducing the
hedgehog’s chance of extinction
doesn’t necessarily have to be done
by changing the national symbol.
And let’s face it, if every species in
trouble were made a national symbol
we’d end up with the wildlife chart
of the UK slapped on a coat of arms.
But the other species were perhaps
not considered lovable enough to
make the cut.
In fact one in three species have
halved in number over the past half
century. The tiger moth has taken
one of the biggest battering’s with
numbers having fallen 95%. Turtle
doves have declined by 93% since
1970, and bats, butterflies, beetles,
red squirrels and woodpeckers are
just a few of the hardest hit species.
Maybe with the hedgehog as a
national symbol awareness of the
peril of all wildlife in the UK would
be brought to centre stage. Looking
at this from a non-conservationist,
eco-unfriendly point of view
though, the hedgehog is really
not the kind of animal we need
as a national symbol. Conserving
habitats for our diverse wildlife is
extremely important; but changing
our national symbol will help
neither the hedgehog nor Britain’s
dignity.
Yes,there may be no lions roaming
the British countryside,being tossed
the occasional steak by passers-by.
But at least the lion as a symbol
doesn’t make us the laughing stock
of the world. A hedgehog, on the
other hand, probably would.
ISIS must be destroyed with air strikes
This is a clash between civilisation and barbarism – and civilisation must triumph
Christopher Whitehouse
Writer

n the wake of Paris, David
Cameron is set to ask the
House of Commons to
authorise anti-ISIS strikes in
Syria. In terms of strategy, this is
common sense. The RAF is already
striking ISIS targets in Iraq – it is
ludicrous to respect a non-existent
border that our enemy does not.
Critics are right that escalation
of British airstrikes alone will
not be decisive. However, like the
UN Security Council Resolution
passed unanimously last week, a
vote to escalate airstrikes would
be an important symbol of British
determination, and a small step
towards a final victory in the war
against ISIS
But the justice of the cause must
never be in doubt: ISIS must be
destroyed.In my opinion,jihadism is
ideologically very similar to Nazism.
It is a utopian mass movement,both
revolutionary and reactionary in
nature. It seeks the overthrow and
conquest of governments to restore
the glory of a lost Empire. It values
strength, purity and loyalty to the
Nation above all other virtues. It
despises Western liberal democracy
as corrupting and indulgent. It has
a genocidal hatred of minorities.
Its “grievances” are irrational and
ultimately impossible to appease.
That’s what they believe, so what
do they do? ISIS has attempted
a genocide of the entire Yazidi
people, sparing only those girls they
sexually enslave. They’ve sought the
destruction of the Kurds, to punish
them for their adoption of liberal
Western values. Homosexuals are
thrown from buildings, “adulterers”
stoned to death. And as we saw in
Paris, they seek to strike at the very
heart of the West. Just as Nazism
caused the Holocaust and World
War II,this barbarity is an inevitable
consequence of their hideous
ideology. Thus co-existence is not
just undesirable but impossible.
Since the collapse of the Twin
Towers, much of Western liberal
opinion has been unable to
maintain moral clarity. In Syria
and Iraq, millions of innocents
have been caught between Assad’s
barrel bombs on the one hand, and
the knives of jihadists on the other.
Hundreds of thousands have died,
millions are internally displaced or
in exile.Given this status quo,where
both Assad and ISIS are deliberately
maximising the devastation, ruling
any Western intervention as
immoral on the grounds of civilian
casualties is the height of absurdity.
Similarly, those who complain
that Mohammed Emwazi (Jihadi
John), ought to have been tried
in a British court need to answer
a simple question: how? The
butcher of American aid workers
and Japanese journalists was in
Raqqa, deep in ISIS territory. The
choice was between a drone strike
and doing nothing. One can only
conclude that these critics are more
concerned with not getting the
West’s hands dirty, than any notion
of justice or protection of innocents.
Morally, there is a world of
difference between the forces of
theocracy and democracy. It really
is black and white. If we are to win
both the war on the ground and the
war of ideas, we must never lose
sight of that simple truth.
Irrational
and
ultimately
impossible
to appease
