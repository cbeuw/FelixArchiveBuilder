fter a promising month
windsurfing at our
London HQ (Queen
Mary Reservoir),
Imperial windsurfers grabbed
their wetsuits and embarked on
an incredible journey to Bude,
Cornwall. Home to Europe’s oldest
living man, Stanley Lucas, Bude
invites tourists to enjoy its scenic
coastal pathways and relaxing
English charm. What windsurfers
had in mind, however, was
something far gnarlier. The arrival
of the first winter Westerlies set a
blustery backdrop to a windsurfing
weekend like no other.Alongside 50
or so university clubs from across the
UK,Imperial windsurfers joined the
lakeside antics at the UK’s biggest
student windsurfing festival: Aussie
Kiss,a landmark event hosted by the
Student Windsurfing Association
(SWA).
Aussie Kiss (like a French kiss,
only down under) has a long
legacy, with 2015 marking its
14th
consecutive year. With an
appropriately epic theme, ‘The Age
of Discovery’, it was organised
as part of the SWA’s event series
which attracted over 500 students
to share in a celebration of all
things windsurfing. Aussie Kiss has
become a startling achievement of
university collaboration, harnessing
the passion of an entire community,
welcoming people not only to a
sport but also to a family.The power
of this year’s event was astonishing,
with countless opportunities for
everyone to get involved both on
and off the water.
Within the university ranks,
student instructors piled forth to
run classes for all abilities. Taster
sessions gave beginners the chance
to try the sport for the first time
whilst intermediate and advanced
clinics focused on cracking new
moves including water starts, carve
gybes, and even the Flaka. The
event grew even bigger this year
and attracted premium sponsors
including Patrik, Sailloft and
Boardwise. This guaranteed plenty
of opportunities for surfers to try
cutting edge equipment for the first
time.
Saturday was a quiet day
with changing wind conditions
at Roadford Lake. Imperial
windsurfers made the most of the
free sailing with the entire club out
on the water for the majority of
the day. An eleven-person paddle
board made the perfect light wind
distraction and the sun kept shining
all day.
Newly crowned start windsurfers
Gemma McNamara, Javier Ash
and Lucinda Wilkinson faired
excellently out on the water in
blustery afternoon winds. Off-
shore conditions meant gybes were
avoided but excellent progress
on upwind maneuvers showed
clear promise for potential race
contenders. Elsewhere, more
advanced members dived into
sessions, swapping tips with other
universities and all looked very
comfortable blasting around.
Saturday was rounded off with a DJ
set from sponsors Red Bull and, in
true SWA tradition, the night was
made special by an immense fancy
dress party with ‘Fictional Explorer’
costumes ranging from Disney’s UP
to the Wild Thornberrys.
Sunday morning dawned with
caravans shaking, trees trembling,
and the sign of some excellent
wind for a hard day of competition.
Representing Imperial in the
freestyle, Adam Ouzeri showed his
flair with switch stance sailing and
completing duck gybes and cowboy
maneuvers. Part of a strong heat,
this was unfortunately not quite
enough and Adam was eliminated
in the first round.
Nevertheless, this did not
discourage Adam, who was later
joined by Joel Russell and Samuel
Cooper for the team race. With
an excellent starting leg from Sam,
Imperial qualified first in their heat,
setting up for a high octane final
that saw Imperial out in front for
the majority of the race. In the final
leg, however, strong racing from
Southampton and Birmingham
saw Imperial pipped to the finish
and claiming third place. With the
sun setting on the lake during the
award presentation, a podium finish
was a satisfactory accomplishment,
but, more importantly, it does
leave strong hopes for the next
competition. With the next SWA
event ‘Up The Brum’ just a week
away (4th-
6th
December), it won’t be
long until Imperial get to settle the
score.
Aussie Kiss was another weekend
of sheer fun that shows off all the
fantastic work underway in student
windsurfing, enabling a nationwide
activity that is active, inclusive and
progressive. Imperial are proud to
be part of a movement with such
a wide offering to all students. If
windsurfing is something you’ve
ever liked the look of then it’s never
too late to try something new, and
we would love to see you at the next
SWA event in Birmingham!

American football: stung by Bath Bees

L
ast Sunday, the Immortals
hosted their first home
game this season against
the Bath Killer Bees.After
coming out of two bye weeks in a
row,the Immortals were determined
to earn their first win at home but
unfortunately, were unable to stop
the swarm.
Overall, the first quarter started
out poorly.Defensively,we struggled
a lot, allowing the Killer Bees to
score three touchdowns early on
from pass plays. Panic seemed to be
present within the team after going
down three scores to nothing and
may have caused some of the poorly
executed assignments from the
offensive players.
In the second quarter, defensive
game plans were changed to solely
man coverage as zone coverage
proved to be unsuccessful. This was
a major turning point of the match
as the defensive team prevented
the Killer Bees’ offense from
gaining significant yardage and
even forced a fumble when Jonas
Schwenckzennegger teamed up
with the linebackers to bring down
an oncoming running back.
Offensively, we executed our
assignments very well and even
got two yards within the end zone.
Unfortunately, due to a mishap with
the snap, we were unable to score
on that play. Intermittent errors in
the third quarter for the offensive
team and penalties for mistakes
like false starts meant that we were
unable to make many significant
advancements. The defensive team
was solid in the second half and,
despite the Killer Bees scoring one
more touchdown, many rookies
stepped up, solidifying the defense.
Special mention goes to Imraj
Singh Sunner for flying around the
pitch, handing out massive tackles
to anyone going through the front
seven. The offensive team had their
best quarter yet heading into the
fourth with the quarterback moving
the ball effectively and Papa Noach
scoring a crucial touchdown and
conversion that ended the game with
a deeply frustrating score of 8-29.
Mistakes early on unfortunately
cost us the match.
The defensive MVPs for this
match are the D-Line, once again
for an outstanding game,preventing
any successful significant run plays
from the opposing team and Imraj
‘J’aime à la folie les filles françaises’
Singh Sunner, for stepping up and
causing a lot of trouble for the Bath
offense. The offensive MVP goes
to Sam ‘Famalam’ Hill for having
an amazing game and handing out
some terrifying cut blocks.
Overall MVP goes to Papa Noach
for his many great plays, especially
a dazzling catch that lead to a
touchdown and his recovery from
an unsuccessful snap during the
conversion to score two more points
for the team. The Ironman award
goes to our quarterback Kevin
Kim Kardashian for persisting
throughout every play even after
some big sacks against him. Finally,
even though he didn’t get any
awards, a big mention to Spewy ‘is
never the designated driver/goes
to a top university/plays American
football/has a friend’ Coidan for
bashing his #hitstick and almost
slowing down a Bath player.
Despite the loss, the Immortals
look forward to their next home
game against the Hertforshire
Hurricanes this Sunday. We would
like to thank everyone who helped
out and came to support the team,
especially the cheerleaders and the
old boys. It was a pleasure to see
familiar faces such as Rob ‘Works
From Home Alone 3 Better Than
The First Two’, Matt ‘has lost his
mind’ Connell and James ‘was the
big dog’ Alden.
Stretching, we think. Photo Credit: Imperial Immortals
There were strong individual performances despite the loss
