N
ew research has
uncovered that students
working for degrees at
English universities are
paying more on average than those
in China, Japan or the USA.
During the 2013/14 year, those
studying in Britain were paying an
average of £6000 per year. The US
was a close second with average
annual fees of £5300, and Japan
followed with a dreamy £3300
yearly mean. The study did not
include private universities, such
as Harvard, Columbia and Yale in
the US, many of which in charge
much higher fees. Around 40% of
students in the US attend private
universities, with their average
fees topping £14,000. In the UK,
there are only four fully private
universities.

Shadow chancellor praises Imperial on visit
M
P and shadow
chancellor, John
McDonnell, visited
Imperial this week,
where he gave a speech acclaiming
Imperial’s role in science and
innovation. This visit comes only
two weeks after George Osborne,
the chancellor of the exchequer,
visited Imperial’s White City
campus, where he said Imperial
represented “the future of our
economy here in the UK”.
The Labour MP made his speech
from ‘the Incubator’, which offers
leases of office and lab space to new
companies.
In his speech, Mr McDonnell
called the new Imperial West
campus a “tremendous initiative”
and mentioned his particular
excitement, as the member of
parliament for a West London
constituency.
On arrival, he said: “What an
inspiring place this is to speak
about the future of the economy…
at Imperial College’s Incubator,
where start-ups and entrepreneurs
are working alongside the leading
minds in science.”The Labour front
bencher went on to emphasise the
importance of new technology
in developing the UK’s economy,
with the Incubator being a prime
example of this.
The MP spoke of how his
generation had taken free
education and affordable housing
for granted, questioning why years

after the advances several different
governments had made, the MP’s
grandchildren would have a less
secure future than him. Citing “new
hope” under Jeremy Corbyn, with
“new economics” and a “sustainable
society”, he criticised austerity and
the big corporations whose actions
go unhindered under current policy.
Praising Imperial for showing
people how science, technology, and
innovation are shaping “our new
world”,the shadow chancellor added
that the Labour Party would work
with businesses and universities
to help deliver his vision. He also
pledged to increase the amount the
UK spends on research as a share of
GDP, to bring it in line with levels
seen in France, Germany and the
US.
On Wednesday, McDonnell
waved a copy of Chairman Mao’s
‘little red book’ at George Osborne
in the House of Commons, in
protest of the move to sell state
assets to China. George Osborne
had previously shown China’s
President, Xi Jinping, around
Imperial on a state visit.
The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) conducted the study.
This is the first of its type to
be done since the coalition
government tripled the maximum
tuition fees for the 2012 incoming
year group. The study took into
account the average fees in more
than 30 countries.
However, the Parisian think
tank says our high fees are
matched with higher graduate
employment wages than in most
of the countries surveyed. As well
as calling the system in England
“efficient” and “probably fair”...
