I
n the film Love, the walls in
protagonist Murphy’s (Karl
Glusman) bedroom seem to
serve as a mission statement
for Argentinian director Gaspar
Noé: plastered with posters for
shocking art-house fare – Pasolini’s
Salo, Warhol’s Frankenstein 3D,Tod
Browning’s Freaks – it is clear to us
that one day Noé wants to take his
place among the auteurs of upset,the
unsettlers of the staid filmgoer. But
to achieve this you really need to be
able to produce something shocking
and offensive; unfortunately for
Noé, boring your audience to the
point of nausea doesn’t count.
The barely-there plot of Love is
straightforward: we are introduced
to Murphy on New Year’s Day,
hung-over, the warm domesticity of
his life (cherubic son feeding him
cereal, girlfriend teasing him for
gaining weight) is shattered by his
nihilistic inner monologue, which
declares that his ‘life is shit’. He still
pines for his ex-girlfriend, Electra
(Aomi Muyock), who encouraged
him to take part in a threesome with
their 16-year-old neighbour Omi
(Klara Kristen), this led Murphy
to cheat on Electra with Omi, who
subsequently became pregnant,
upturning his life and trapping him
in a bucolic paternalism.
But really the plot’s function is
the engine that drags us from one
artful sex scene to another. It is true
that Noé has a sense of style: the
shots are all well-lit, with excellent
cinematography from Benoît Debie
(so far removed from his work on
the lurid Spring Breakers),giving the
frames a grainy, authentic, film-like
quality.Noé takes an unconventional
approach to the idea of the jump cut,
interspersingeachtakewithasecond
of black screen. This heightens the
photographic quality, giving us the
sense we are travelling backwards
and forwards through Murphy’s
memories, as if on a Kodak carousel.
Unfortunately, it also means that,
from the 90-minute mark onwards,
there are innumerable occasions
where we think the film has
finished, the screen switching to
black, only to have our hopes cruelly
dashed – forget Lars von Trier, Noé
is cinema’s true sadist. It also brings
attention to the bloated runtime of
135 minutes, which possibly comes
from having Noé act as his own
editor; removing the blank shots
in favour of a Godardian approach
would have saved the audience about
15 precious minutes of torture.
Aside from Noé’s style, and the
excellent, eclectic soundtrack, pretty
much everything else in the film
is poor. The script, in particular, is
clunky, full of aphorisms about love
and death that are toe-curlingly
humiliating. Noé’s decision to
use non-professional actors has
certainly not paid off, and while we
may perhaps admire him for the
gamble, admiration does not a good
film make.It is difficult to tell where
the wooden acting ends and the
bad dialogue begins, really. Perhaps
the actors would have done better
with a competent script, or perhaps
the script would have been better
serviced by experienced actors – we
will never know. What is perhaps
most unsettling about the screenplay
is the sheer unfamiliarity of people
and places: the characters are all
supposed to be ‘real’ people, but I
have never, never, met anyone who
behaved or spoke in such a contrived
way; the film provisionally takes
place in Paris, except the fact that
everyone speaks perfect English. It
adds up to a sense of falsity the film
can’t shake off, not even with the
unsimulated sex scenes.
And onto these scenes: Noé
wants to bring back the sense of
‘warmness’ he identified in 1970s
and ‘80s erotica; or, in the words
of Murphy, one of many characters
representing the director, wants to
“make a movie that truly depicts
sentimental sexuality”. So, does Noé
achieve this? Well, let’s take a brief
overview of the evidence.
Watching the numerous sex
scenes,which recur through the film
like a persistent case of herpes, here
are things I thought about during
these unwelcome interruptions to
the narrative: whether or not I need
to order new contact lenses, the

Forget Lars
von Trier,
Gaspar Noé
is cinema’s
true sadist
It’s a no for Gaspar Noé
Wooden acting, clunky dialogue, and childish themes mean Love fails to light a fire
discography of Funkadelic, knitting,
the soup I had waiting for me at
home, Fran Lebowitz, the use of
‘winter’ as a verb. Here are things I
did not think about: sex.
You see, there is an issue with
sex scenes in cinema: it’s not that
they’re offensive, or shocking, but
really that they’re mind-numbingly
boring. Noé’s scenes, despite their
masterful lighting, have such little
sexual charge it’s like being hit in
the face with a carrier bag full of
dead batteries.
Above all, the film is juvenile,
embarrassingly so. It’s the kind of
minor work that a director would
make at the beginning of their
career, and regard later on with a
kind of warm,slightly-cringeworthy
affection.From the couple’s decision
to name their child Gaspar, to Noé’s
cameo as an art gallery owner who
fucks Electra against a wall a couple
of scenes after being introduced,
the entire thing is endlessly self-
referential.
What Love really managed to do
was make me long to watch other
films–hardlyaringingendorsement.
The flaccid erotica on display made
me long for the summertime
sensuality of Luca Guadagnino’s
I Am Love, or the shimmering
sexual mirage of Alain Guiraudie’s
Stranger by the Lake; the wooden
dialogue, which comes down on the
audience with such force it could
constitute a deadly weapon, made
me yearn for the remarkable script
of Richard Linklater’s Before…
trilogy, and the entire experience –
so nauseating in its pretentiousness,
in its elevation of style over any
simulacra of substance – made me
ache to get home,put on a miserable
British social realist film, and scrub
the entire 135-minute experience
out of my mind.
Love
Dir: Gaspar Noé Script: Gaspar
Noé Starring: Karl Gusman;
Aomi Muycock; Klara Kristin. 135
minutes.
Güeros
Dir: Alonso Ruizpalacios Script:
Alonzo Ruizpalacios; Gibrán
Viradi Ramírez Portela Starring:
Tenoch Huerta; Sebastián Aguirre;
Ilse Salas. 108 minutes.
I
really had no idea what to
expect from my first art-house
film, but if they’re all like
Güeros, then sign me up.
Existentialist at its heart, the
whole film is a joyous and somewhat
satirical exploration of what it
means to be young and rebellious.
It follows young Tomás, his elder
brother Frederico, and roommate
Santós, amidst the 1999 student
protests as the three restless youths
search Mexico city for a dying folk-
rocker.
While the plot may sound
lacking, it doesn’t really matter;
where the film finds meaning is in
the interactions of its characters
and their viewpoints, not in some
built up climax and resolution.
An extremely fun film, there are
moments of black humour that send
you reeling, stories told that are left
unfinished, and hilariously meta
moments when the camera asks the
actors what they think of the film.
These combine to produce a film
that’s incredibly self aware and
intelligent in what it wants to show
you – by the end of it you feel like
Hand Gestures
Dir: Francesco Clerici. Script:
Francesco Clerici; Martina De
Santis. 77 minutes.
A
meditative exploration
of craftsmanship and
the passion of artisans,
Hand Gestures takes
a long, slow look at the work of
Fonderia Artistica Battaglia, a
foundry located in Milan, that has
been making bronze sculptures for
the last century. The technique they
use, lost-wax casting, goes back
even further, to the 4th
millennium
BC. This information, about the
technique and the foundry is shown
at the beginning of the film, and
then for 77 minutes we are left
alone, with the craftsmen and a
sculpture.
With no soundtrack, other than
the occasional strain of a classical
concerto coming in from the radio,
and largely static shots, director
Francesco Clerici seems to have
taken a leaf out of Frederick
Wiseman’s book – although it is
good that he does not inhabit a
Wiseman-esque approach to time,
since there is no way the subject
would have been able to stretch to
more than the film’s current run
time.
Thoughtfully shot throughout,
there is the sense that we are being
admitted into a sacred space when
we enter the foundry, something
only heightened by the silence of
the craftsmen.
Throughout, the footage is
interspersed with footage from the
1960s; lost-wax casting is passed
down by oral tradition, and – as
the black and white clips show –
the only thing to have changed is
the approach to health and safety.
Although– spoiler alert – the life-
size dog sculpture produced at
the end is fucking hideous, Hand
Gestures serves as a powerful visual
link to the past.But the line between
pensive and ponderous is a narrow
one, and while Hand Gestures
just about manages to remain
entertainingly reflective, it did push
this sleep-deprived reviewer to the
limit.

My Nazi Legacy
Dir: David Evans Script: Philippe
Sands Starring: Philippe Sands;
Niklas Frank; Horst von Wächter.
96 minutes.
W
hile children are not
responsible for the
sins of the fathers,
there are occasions
where the legacy left behind by our
forbearers is inescapable. Such is
the case in My Nazi Legacy, where
international genocide lawyer
Philippe Sands explores the burden
of history resting on the shoulders
Steve McQueen: The
Man & Le Mans
Dir:Gabriel Clarke;John McKenna.
Starring: Steve McQueen; Chad
McQueen; Neile Adams. 112
minutes.
F
or the avid cinephile,
whose interest in films
borders on the obsessive,
there is a special passion
for the ‘making-of’ narrative. Steve
McQueen: The Man & Le Mans taps
into this with a behind-the-scenes
look at Le Mans, a 1971 passion
project of ‘King of Cool’ Steve
McQueen, based on the legendary
24 hour motor race. With little in
term of plot or dialogue, the film
was an unmitigated flop, but still
holds a special place in motorists’
hearts for the realism it brought to
the screen.
Indeed, Le Mans is a visual treat
– serpentine shots from the cars
place the viewer immediately at the
point where rubber meets tarmac.
Directors Gabriel Clarke and John
McKenna got lucky twice in their
discovering of unseen raw footage
from the 1971 film and unheard
audio of McQueen himself.
They approach the challenge of
representing audio footage well,
pairing it with sparse landscape
shots that form a counterpoint to
the dynamism of Le Mans.
Seen from our present-age
viewpoint, McQueen is something
akin to an extra-terrestrial:
married to a Broadway starlet and
oozing rugged machismo, he is
a slice of nostalgic Americana, a
throwback to an age that – despite
embedding itself in the public
consciousness – seems impossibly
remote. McQueen’s obsession with
representing his passion of racing as
purely as possible may have crashed
through the film barrier in terms of
technique, but also put many people
at risk, culminating in British racer
David Piper losing a leg on set.
At 102 minutes, the film’s biggest
issue is that it is too long. Certain
scenes could have been cut out
completely without no detriment
to the structure – most notably
a bizarre segue into the Manson
Family murders that adds little to
the film other then to its length.
As a piece of pure filmmaking,
Steve McQueen: The Man & Le
Mans is robust, and Clarke and
McKenna deliver a film that hums
with visual energy. Where it really
excels, however, it in building up a
psychological portrait of McQueen,
allowing us to peer under the hood
of an icon, and see the obsessive
engine beneath.
FRED FYLES
you’ve spoken to the director Alonso
Ruizpalacios himself. That’s what
the whole film is: a witty and honest
conversation about what it was like
to be the kinds of people depicted.
The fun extends to the film’s
cinematography, and boy does
Ruizpalacios get inventive, playing
around with image and sound to
make you smile. Shot entirely in
black and white and in the old
4:3 aspect ratio, it’s a refreshing
departure from what we expect to
be plonked in front of us when we
hear ‘film’, and soon enough you
learn to trust the director, and enjoy
the ride.
As an introduction to art-
house movies, Güeros is perfect.
An endlessly interesting film, it
establishes Alonso Ruizpalacios as
a director to watch. Go see it, and
come away with a smile on your
face.
THOMAS CARROLL
of Niklas Frank and Horst von
Wächter, whose fathers were the
Nazi governors of Poland and
Galicia respectively, responsible for
sending thousands upon thousands
to their deaths.
What follows is a deeply personal
documentary – Sands grandfather,
who grew up in Lviv, Ukraine, was
the only family member out of 80
to survive the Holocaust – that
shakes up our preconceived black-
and-white notions of attitudes to
the past. Frank has come to terms
with the legacy of his father, and is
completely ready to denounce him
as an evil man. For von Wächter,
however, the fall of Nazi Germany
meant he ‘dropped out of normality’,
and there is a sense that he has never
really returned. He refuses to face
up to his father’s undeniable links
to the Holocaust, and yet in some
ways he cuts the most sympathetic
figure of the film – a much less
polished speaker than Frank, there
is a sense that he is exposing himself
completely to the camera. “I don’t
want to be stuck somewhere full of
pain,” he says, and it is difficult for
us not to see where he is coming
from. As the film progresses, he is
brought more and more evidence
of his father’s deed, but von
Wächter remains an immovable
object against the irresistible force
of oppressive history Sands brings
down.
While Sands adds an Adam
Curtis-esque authority to the
documentary, his linking together
of past and present events is not as
seamless – we end the documentary
on a mediation on growing Fascist
sentiment in the Ukraine that seems
to sit oddly with the rest of the film.
Nevertheless, My Nazi Legacy is a
moving, deeply personal portrait of
the scars left by the march of history.
