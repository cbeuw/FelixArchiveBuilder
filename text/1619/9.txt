IsTuesday’s child full of grace?
Research at Imperial College London adds an additional layer to the supposed
‘weekend effect’ currently being used as a political footbal
L
ike most politicians,
Jeremy Hunt is used to
featuring in the headlines
for all the wrong
reasons. His continuing tete-a-
tete with junior doctors has split
the population, either outraged at
current youth salaries, or in disbelief
over the strain cuts could have on
our NHS.
With 98% of balloted Junior
Doctors supporting strike action,
they are adamant that this is
a disagreement that concerns
respect, trust and the quality of
the NHS, not a demand for a pay
rise. Hunt’s claims about the drop-
off in weekend care experienced
by patients have been strongly
refuted by NHS staff from all
backgrounds. Some statisticians
are seriously questioning his use of
data presented to parliament which
allegedly supports the demand for a
‘seven-day NHS’.
Mr. Hunt is thought to have
carefully selected his conclusions via
a study published in 2012,by a team
from University College London.
Investigations as to whether there
was a difference in risk of death
between those admitted to hospital
at the weekend than a weekday,
concluded that admission at the
weekend was indeed associated with
an increased death risk within 30
days of admission. However, what
Mr Hunt forgot to mention, was
that the overall likelihood of death
actually occurring on a weekend was
less than on a weekday.
New research conducted by
Professor Paul Aylin and his team
at Imperial College London, has
just added an additional layer to the
‘weekend effect’ debate. The paper
published by the British Medical
Journal analysed over 1.3 million
births in NHS services in England
between April 2010 and March
2012. Imperial scientists found that
births occurring at the weekend had
a higher risk of complications than
those occurring during the week.
When using the comparison of
per thousand babies delivered, the
rate of perinatal death (stillborn or
death within seven days of birth)
on weekdays was 6.5 per thousand
babies delivered whereas the rate
of babies dying across the weekend
was 7.1.
“In our paper we tried to account
forthefactthatdifferencesinratesof
complications on different days may
be due to chance, or that births on
certain days are more complicated
in some way,” said Professor Aylin
a senior academic from Imperial’s
School of Public Health. “However,
evenaftermakingtheseadjustments,
we found the rates of complications
vary on different days.”
In fact, Tuesday was the day with
the lowest rate of stillbirths. So as
well as Tuesday’s child being ‘full
of grace,’ do they also ensure a
hassle-free delivery? I’m sure Hunt
would jump to that conclusion.
Speculating far enough, you could
say these findings support his
plans, those same plans which some
portray as an attempt to ‘destroy’the
NHS as we currently know it.
Before Mr Hunt rejoices too much
however,the second part of the study
investigated whether there was a
link between birth complications
and the recommended consultant
staffing levels in labour wards: no
association was found between
consultant staffing levels and
complications such as perinatal
death or injuries to the baby during
birth.
“We don’t know what causes this
difference, and when we looked at
consultant staffing levels we didn’t
see a strong link between reduced
staffing and complications,” said
Aylin.“More work needs to be done
to better understand the causes of
these differences, so that steps can
be taken to improve outcomes for
mothers and babies. Maternity care
involves a whole team including
midwives and other medical staff,
so one avenue for future research
might be to look at staffing levels
beyond consultants.”

complications that could occur
during birth (on any day of the
week) an anonymous new mother
and medical registrar for the NHS,
stated that “there are so many life
and hospital factors to consider in
each individual patient case, that
one single reason simply cannot
explain why complications occur in
pregnancy”.
Dr William Palmer, lead author
and honorary research fellow from
the School of Public Health, also
raised an interesting point: “we have
been able to present a detailed and
comprehensive assessment of the
‘weekend effect’ in this important
area of healthcare. However, this
is a study based on administrative
data and so we did not observe the
quality of care directly.”
Clearly a statement about patient
care cannot be created from these
findings if the care of women and
babies was in no way monitored.
So, whilst this is interesting data it
is important to remember that this
is an observational study; we should
not draw conclusions in the same
way Jeremy Hunt did after the 2012
report on the adult mortality rate.
Thus, speculation should be kept
out of the political arena. Until
further investigations are completed,
we can still presume that ‘the child
that is born on the Sabbath day’can
still be expected to be ‘bonny and
blithe, and good and gay’.

100 years of general relativity
How Stephen Hawking didn’t come to Imperial, but we had a great time anyway
S
tudents and staff at Imperial
were so thrilled to hear
Professor Stephen Hawking
was going to pay a visit to
Imperial to celebrate 100 years
of general relativity that 6,000 of
us tried to obtain tickets for the
conference. Insufficient space in
The Great Hall led to a ballot where
specific members of the Imperial
faculty and student body were
admitted, leaving those fortunate
enough to get tickets eagerly waiting
to see the legend that is Professor
Stephen Hawking. Unfortunately
though, due to illness he was a no-
show.
However this small hurdle didn’t
seem to greatly affect excitement
surrounding the event. “We
were all extremely excited about
meeting Stephen Hawking to
talk about general relativity in
person, but we’re equally excited
to hear from his students who
are now famous professors at
imperial. The knowledge will still
be communicated” said Dr. Ling
Chi, executive officer to the Vice
President for Development and
Innovation.Similar sentiments were
echoed from other eager attendees.
As usual the Provost, Professor
James Stirling, started the
celebration with a ‘short’ speech,
introducing the night’s speakers and
providing the necessary background
needed to fully appreciate the
100 years that have passed since
Einstein published his theory of
general relativity.
He further expressed his
disappointment in Stephen
Hawking not being able to attend,
but stressed his concern for the
theoretical physicist’s health, before
wishing him a swift recovery
“Of course we hoped that
Professor Stephen Hawking would
be here to deliver a presentation this
evening, and we were all saddened
to learn that Stephen has been
unwell recently and is unable to be
here with us today. So, on behalf
of everyone at Imperial College, I
would like to wish Stephen a very
full and speedy recovery.”

I know you
will be in
very good
hands with
students
who trained
in my
relativity
group
Before handing the stage over to
the speakers,he treated the audience
to a recorded message by Professor
Hawking.
“I am very sorry that I cannot
be here with you to celebrate 100
years of Einstein’s theory of general
relativity. Albert Einstein was the
greatest physicist of the 20th
Century
and his discoveries revolutionised
our understanding of the world
and our place in it. Although I
cannot be there I know you will be
in very good hands with students
who trained in my relativity group,
Professor Fay Dowker and Professor
Jerome Gauntlett. The theoretical
physics group at Imperial College
has a great tradition in carrying out
research in fundamental physics
since its founding in by Abdus
Salam and I look forward to visiting
on another occasion.”
Professor Fay Dowker kickstarted
the talks with an interactive
presentation titled ‘Inner Space,
Outer Space: A Meditation on
General Relativity’. The talk
started with an overview of our
understanding of the world and
how it changed with the discovery
of gravity by Sir Isaac Newton.
Newtonian gravity claims that
between every two objects in the
universe there is a very precise
force of attraction, proportional
to the masses of the two objects
and inversely proportional to their
distance. The theory was very
successful but also had major critics,
including Isaac Newton himself.
The main criticism was ‘action
at a distance’. To understand the
conundrum imagine what would
happen if the sun suddenly jumped
somewhere else. According to
Newtonian gravity,the force the sun
exerted on the Earth would similarly
instantaneously change and the
earth’s orbit would instantaneously
change. This instantaneous shift
violates the universe’s speed limit.
The speed of light.
This contradiction was a major
thorn in theoretical physics for over
200 years, and Einstein himself
struggled with it for ten years
before coming up with the theory of
general relativity in 1915, unifying
space and time. Professor Dowker
tried to demonstrate the thought
process behind general relativity by
getting the audience to participate
in an experiment where we noted
that it was in fact our chairs pushing
us up, rather than gravity that was
pulling us down. The lecture was
humorous,interactive and extremely
informative, and touched on
interesting philosophical questions
such as the dichotomy of ‘being’
versus ‘becoming’ and the potential
existence of a block universe, where
time and space exist in a block and
it’s our experience that is limited to
only being able to access one part of
the block at a time, so to speak.
Following Professor Dowker,
Professor Jerome Gauntlett took
the stage giving the audience a
more traditional lecture around his
research and our quest of unifying
the theory of relativity with
quantum theory, entitled ‘Black
Holes and the Unity of Physics’. He
took the audience on a journey to
the centre of our universe and the
super massive black hole theorised
to lie there. Black holes are so, well,
massive, containing so much mass
in so little space, that even light
can’t escape their gravitational pull.
The point of no return is the event
horizon and it is this quality that
makes them appear black. This
ability of theirs to suck everything
made it particularly surprising when
Professor Hawking proposed that
actually, black holes are rather hot.
Indeed they emit radiation.
Quantum particles spontaneously
come into existence in pairs all
the time (an electron and an anti-
electron for example), but usually
they collide into each other shortly
after, annihilating each other in the
process and disappearing back into
thin air. Yet sometimes one particle
will find itself into a black hole’s
event horizon, being sucked in and
proceeding towards a space-time
singularity,leaving the other particle
to roam the universe freely and
in the process, emitting radiation.
Professor Gauntlet continued by
explaining the implications of black
holes being ‘quite hot’on theoretical
physics, going briefly into string
theory and outlining some hopes
and aspirations for the future of the
field.
The night concluded with a Q&A
session where the audience was
given the chance to geek out and
take all their existential angst out on
the two speakers.
Overall the event was a beautiful
celebration of our achievements
as human beings and even though
Hawking was a no-show, the talks
generously provided by the two
professors on such short notice gave
us a taste of cutting edge physics
while filling our eyes with stars and
the occasional black hole.
