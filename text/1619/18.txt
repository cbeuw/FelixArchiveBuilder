This week you are very excited
about Star Wars. There’s no
joke here. Star Wars is gonna
be fucking amazing.

This week you want to
celebrate a mass murderer
who came to a foreign
country only to instigate the
subjugation of a whole nation
of people and take their land
from them, however, Tesco
is out of turkey so you give
Thanksgiving a miss.
This week you are Hangman.
Your horoscopes writer
only sends you eleven
horoscopes, and even then
your ability to print them
is called into question. You
print them anyway, and then
make the twelth a meta-
horoscope bitching about the
horoscopes.
This week you go to see that
new 3-D porn film; however,
it is literally the most
insufferable film possible and
you masturbate with your
tears. Someone films you for
evidence and it grosses over
2.3 billion pounds.
This week you are a
Argentinian biochemistry
student and your British
flatmateishelpingyouexpand
your English vocabulary,
however, it conspires that
they were lying to you and
calling your tutor a “saucy
little minx” doesn’t have the
intended effect.
This week after reading a
BBC news article you realise
you forget to show your gran
how to make the thermostat
work and you realize she has
frozen into an icecube. You
feel bad but then realize she’s
still getting her pension and
buy yourself a milkshake to
cheer yourself up.
This week... what the fuck I
just found out the desk cost
like 5000 pounds what the
hell. It better have like a
small masseuse stored inside
one of the drawers for when
you’re stressed.
This week you discover
that beer is actually sold in
the SCR. You realize that
this explains why you’re
thermodynamics lecturer
spent half an hour talking
about the best way to palpate
a dog’s anus.
This week you think about
writing a joke about the new
tree in Beit Quad but the
joke is as dead as your love
of science. Guess I’ll just
become a banker and be rich
but miserable for the rest of
my life.
This week you go to an STD
clinic, um, for a friend, and
you, umm, are wondering
something. Like, if a nurse
touches your penis can you
count her as a sexual partner?
Just asking for a friend…
This week apparently the
Union paid a lot of money for
the desk – no-one would tell
me any more than that so I
assume it’s like full of gold or
something.
This week you realise that if
you write an inappropriate
and unprintable joke that
references [CENSORED],
Hangman will just slap
“censored” over it. I bet this
doesn’t even get printed.
[Yeah, well, it did. -Ed.]

JEREMY HITS BACK: “I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT
WHAT AM I?”
What’s going on inside the
Blue Cube this week
What is: What Is?
Thereappearstohavebeensomeconfusion
of late over what exactly our ‘What Is?’
series actually is, so the wonderful team
responsible for producing it have decided
that they’ll be running a very special edition
this week, letting you know just what ‘What
Is?’ is.
The session will be exploring notions of
just how we can truly appreciate ‘What’
something ‘Is’, and whether we can ever
hope to fully understand the important
concepts we tackle in these events simply
through the medium of a 30-minute talk.
The ‘What Is?’ team would like to reassure
you that the answer is an emphatic ‘yes!’,
but we’ll leave it to them in their session to
do that.
Any fears that that last paragraph sounded
far too humanities-esque can now be
allayed – we have since established that
Simon the Intern wrote it. On an unrelated
note, we regret to announce that Simon
the Intern had an unfortunate accident
involving him and a p45, and he is no longer
working with us. Any intern-related needs
should now be directed to Steve the Intern.
Attendance at this event is, naturally,
compulsory – even if you think you already
know what ‘What Is?’ is, there’s almost
certainly going to be something new and
exciting for you to learn at this event, and
you wouldn’t want to miss out on that. And
even if you did, attendance is compulsory
(likewesaid),soyouhavetoturnupanyway.
Pop along to The Boardroom at 1pm on
Tuesday for the session.
Superiority Sessions
We like to encourage positivity amongst our
staff, and what better way to feel positive
than by feeling better than other people?
That’sright,we’reprovidingspecialsessions
on how to feel superior to everyone else.
You’re already working in the Blue Cube, so
you’re clearly already above the teeming
masses of ignorance, but it never hurts to
be reminded of that fact.
Wednesday, 2pm. The Boardroom. We
look forward to seeing you there - don’t
forget your yoga mats, and green tea will (of
course) be provided!
What’sOnoutsidetheBlue
Cube this week
Oh, who cares? None of us, that’s for sure.
Alice Gast: Thought of the Week
“As Imperial once again makes the news,
I reflect with pride on our world-leading
institution. It really is a joy to see leaders
from other universities admiring the result of
such incredibly hard work by our investment
department – I know it took those lovely boys
weeks to get KPMG to bung us a cheeky £20
million for that Data Science whatever, and I
look forward to a long and prosperous future
of being bought out by many more amoral
accounting firms!”

Provost Post of
the Week
Every week, we like to
provide the opportunity for
one of our wonderful Vice
Provosts to write a short
column on a topic of their
choice. Providing our staff
with the opportunity to
communicate to the masses
in such a highly respected
organ as Blue3
is key to our
continued commitment to
staff development here in
the Blue Cube. This week
we welcome Joe Kinaround,
the Vice Provost (Political
Dealings) for a few words on
our recent visitations from the
powers that be.
Hello everybody!
What an absolutely smashing
pleasure it is to be writing this
week’s Provost Post of the
Week. As an avid reader of Blue
News – oh, sorry, it’s Blue3
now,
isn’t it! I really must keep on
top of these things! - I’ve been
lobbying Alice for months to
give me a post of my own. And
after that little kerfuffle with
Reese Huffle (ahem) last week,
it has finally fallen to me to
give all of you top fellows (and
fellow-esses!) a few words of
wisdom that I’ve picked up in
my time here.
As I’m sure many of you are
aware, my job mostly involves
liaising with the political powers
(or political non-powers, in the
case of those bloody lefties
in the Shadow Cabinet) to
encourage them to come and
have a butcher’s at the vital
work we do here at Imperial.
Obviously, they always
come away feeling extremely
impressed at just how world-
leading we are (I’d like to think
we’ve come to define the term
in their eyes), but there’s always
more we can be doing to make
sure their visits show us at our
best. As such, I’ve got a few
points for you all to enact and
react to!
1. No more bloody students.
Get rid of them.
2. Seriously, I mean it, stop
letting students interact with
our guests. It’s unprofessional.
3. That’s it.
Hello all,
Welcome one, welcome all, welcome everybody to another edition
of Blue3
, everyone’s favourite newsletter about the wonderful (and
sometimes wacky!) goings-on of the Faculty Building of Imperial College
London.
This week or so we appear to be have been inundated with floods of
important visitors – a reflection on our world-leading status as a beacon
of science of prosperity, no doubt! – which means all of us here in the
Blue Cube have been somewhat rushed off our feet making all of these
important people feel right at home amongst our gleaming spires and
ivory concrete towers.
First off, we had the lovely boys and girls from the Lancet (subs, can you
please check what this is? I’ve never heard of it before) over to give us
some more talks about antibiotics and how they should totally work
or whatever – a continuation of our themes from last week of Doing
Science™, taking a strong Stance on Science™ and being a Science
Stronghold™ (with thanks to the lovely Simon the intern for getting that
last one trademarked!).
Then we had a collection of the finest minds in Europe – the leaders
of various leading universities across Europe (or LERU – the League of
European Research Universities – if you like acronyms, which I personally
don’t) all came together for a cup of tea and a nice chat about Europe and
how our current government seems intent on leaving it altogether. As the
most world-leading institution amongst many, we were of course chosen
to host the whole shebang, and host it we did! Guests were treated to a
lovely tour of our Big Number Crunching Box™, as well as a quick visit to
those lovely biologists next door. Great fun!
And finally we had some pinko leftie drop in uninvited to give us a
surprisingly effective stand-up comedy set, where he made such corking
jokes as “The Labour Party will work with business”! We probably won’t be
allowing him back into the vicinity of any of our campuses, but it was nice
to have a good laugh nonetheless.
Have a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!
