The time will come
when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other’s welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you
all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.
Love After Love

ucked away around
the corner from King’s
Cross St. Pancras lies
The Invisible Dot, an
intimate comedy venue hosting
comedians from all over the
country. As I quietly entered the
room to stand at the back of the bar,
David Elms made his way on stage,
acoustic guitar in hand.He talked to
the crowd politely and surprisingly
quietly, smoothing them into his set
with boyish charm.
Standing at the front of the stage,
as still as a statue, he delivered
hilarious jokes in a mild, deadpan
style that thrilled his audience. We
were led down a winding path of
back catalogue stories from his life,
only to be surprised with sudden
changes in tone and direction. On
top of this messing with the crowd,
he would intentionally create
awkward, tense moments. The
audience were constantly on their
toes, anticipating what he would say
to diffuse the them.
Elms talked about his (recently)
married life,learning to compromise
marriage through music and song.
In fact, there may have been a bit
too much audience participation,
as he next asked eight audience
members to play out various scenes
from his life.Thankfully, in this case
the people he chose played out their
respective parts entertainingly.
The strongest part of his set was
undoubtedly the musical section.
Displaying great talent, he told
heart-warmingly emotional stories
about his marriage and love through
song. He alternated between these
poignant moments – almost causing
the crowd to well up – and cracking
out jokes that caused uncontrollable
explosions of laughter. He also used
pre-recorded material to relate
home situations to the audience,
delighting them with these witty
anecdotes. By the end of the set,
everyone felt they knew David’s
wife pretty well. We left knowing
multitudes of her hilariously
embarrassing stories.

Goya: Chronicler of his time
Jingjie Cheng
Arts Editor
I
first came to know Goya’s
work through his Disasters
of War paintings and Black
Paintings – dark,sinister works
that captured his world view in his
later years. With the unrest around
him and his steady mental and
physical decline at that point, it is
no wonder that his paintings were
bleak and pessimistic. However,
in an amazing exhibition at the
National Gallery, I discovered an
entirely new dimension to the
Spanish painter – one that reveals
him as an observer of people and a
documenter of his time.
In this largest-ever exhibition of
Goya’s portraits, with works on loan
from all over the world,his expansive
repertoire is explored from his
early days as a court painter of the
aristocracy, to intimate and honest
portraits of his closest friends.
Often described as both the last
of the great masters and the first
of the modernists, Goya straddled
the tumultuous times between
the 18th
and 19th
centuries – the
unrest of the neighbouring French
revolution, the civil unrest in Spain,
and the French invasion were all
reflected in his work. At the same
time, while his earlier portraits were
very classical, taking after masters
like Velazquez, some of his later
works developed the beginnings of
impressionism.There is a continuity
in his paintings, with the same
subjects often appearing in different
paintings at different stages of their
lives. The Marchioness of Santa Cruz,
who appears in his 1805 painting
as a modern muse, was first painted
as a four-year-old girl in his group
portrait of the Osuna family.
We are presented with a man
who is fiercely adaptable, expertly
manoeuvring his way through the
socio-political landscape around
him and constantly affirming his
relevance to the people in power. As
a court painter early in his career,his
style was modern, favoured among
the aristocrats for its alignment
with enlightened principles. After
a devastating illness in 1793 that
left him profoundly deaf, painting
portraits became Goya’s method of
communicating with his subjects.
One of his most magnificent works
is a full-length portrait of his great
friend, the Duchess of Alba, one
of the patrons who brought him
security and encouraged his career
as a painter. Haughty and graceful
in her traditional Spanish lace,
she points to an inscription on the
floor – “only Goya” – a sign of his
popularity among the aristocrats at
court.
Even following the 1808 popular
uprising in Spain, a time of great
political upheaval, Goya’s skills as a
portraitist gave him the flexibility to
adapt his work to the needs of those
in power – be they the enlightened,
the reactionary, the French or the
English. And, even as a portraitist,
Goya recorded the unrest of the
time in the images of the people he
painted. In his study for The Duke of
Wellington, he is uncompromising in
the depiction of the toll war can take
on a man – with drooping eyelids
and sunken cheeks, the haunting
sketch is Goya’s commentary on the
military conflict around him.
To me, Goya’s portraits of his
close friends and family were far
more poignant than those he made
of the aristocracy. His portrait
of Martin Zapater, for example,
expresses palpable tenderness and
sensitivity. This childhood friend
is painted with almost startling
immediacy, as are many of his more
private collections.
The honesty of his portraits
extends to depictions of himself –
in one of them, an aged, unkempt
Goya glances at his own reflection,
revealing scruffy grey hair and tired
eyes. This tired man is the same
one shown in a painting in one of
the earlier rooms, standing in deep
concentration before an easel with
candles adorning his hat – meant to
cast just the right amount of light
on his subjects for his paintings.
The painting that left the greatest
impression on me was found in
the last room. In Self Portrait with
Doctor Arrieta, Goya is weak in the
arms of his doctor, who is trying
to feed him what is presumably
medication. Shadowy figures
lurk in the background, perhaps
the personification of his mental
demons. The exhaustion and
National Gallery’s dedicated show the most thorough exploration of Spanish master’s portraits

The honesty
of his
portraits
extends to
depictions of
himself
resignation in his eyes as he pulls
at his sheets reflects his difficult
survival of the illness that almost
killed him in 1819. Inscribed with
a note of thanks to his doctor, this
unusual work is the culmination of
Goya’s painterly accomplishments:
honesty in depicting himself,
a connection with the people
around him, symbolic purpose and
impeccable technique.
This exhibition is bold, an
unfettered display purely made up
portraits, yet is astute in its curation
and organisation of the many facets
of Goya’s portraiture career.Through
his paintings of people alone, we
are brought on a journey through
socio-political unrest, intellectual
movements and his tumultuous
personal life – a must-see for anyone
interested in the Spanish master.
