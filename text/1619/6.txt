Communism is the key to luxury for all
It’s time to start thinking about a
post-work society

n a speech last Friday at
Imperial, shadow chancellor
John McDonnell outlined
his ideas on a new form
of socialism where “technology
liberates rather than traps.” With
full automation in the not-too-
distant-future almost inevitable, it’s
now time we start thinking about
how Britain will adapt to a post-
work society. McDonnell’s speech
recognised many of the problems
automation might introduce, but
offered few solutions. As a party
firmly rooted in the trade union
movement, Labour seem woefully
unprepared for a world with a
workforce without work.
It’s likely that Imperial students
and researchers will help bring
about the automation revolution,
whether through robotics or
artificial intelligence. It will also be
Imperial alumni who profit from
the resulting mass unemployment
(over the next decade 15 million
jobs are at risk of automation). We
might drive “future innovation in
our economy”, but we could also be
responsible for the largest shift of
wealth in history.
In the recent past, our university
has proven that it is not benevolent.
With the College’s insatiable desire
for funding, can it be trusted with
the future of our society?
Those who own the robots and
own the artificial intelligence will
have the whole nation under their
control; Imperial is likely to be
complicit in all of this. From my
experience, there is an alarming
lack of discussion about the ethics
of our actions. This would be okay
if our politicians contemplated
the consequences of automation,,
but few have the foresight.
Unfortunately, left unregulated, the
technologies we help create could
cause social upheaval and society’s
ultimate collapse.
Yet I still believe we should
embrace automation.The possibility
of a ten hour work week is enough to
make it worth it. John McDonnell
dreams of world “where everybody
has the ability to develop their
talents and enjoyment of life to the
full.” This might be possible, but
only if we look beyond capitalism.
The futurist left have a solution:
fully automated luxury communism.
It begins with the common
ownership of all that is automated,,
enabling luxury for all. Rather
than letting giant corporations
be the sole profiteers of scientific
advance (which will undoubtedly
have been funded in some way by
the state), every citizen of Britain
should have some share of the
profits. We are already automating
more of our transport, health care,
manufacturing, admin, and retail, –
this will only continue.
Take for example Über (which
John McDonnell gave brief mention
of in his speech), a company which
is seeking to be fully driverless by
2030. We shouldn’t let a small few
at the top make vast profits at the
expense of everyone else; instead,
a company like Über should be
publicly owned or run cooperatively
by the community.
If the state nationalised all
automated industries, the
introduction of a universal
basic income would be possible.
The Green Party proposed an
unconditional basic income of £71 a
week in their manifesto (which was
unfairly ridiculed by the media).
This wasn’t proposed in the context
of a post-capitalist society, but it’s
still a good start.
Many might argue that without
competition no innovation
would occur. It’s interesting that
McDonnell decided to describe
his economic ideas as “socialism,
but socialism with an iPad.” Apple
is the most profitable company in
the world and arguably the greatest
success story of capitalism.However,
nearly all of the technology that
makes up Apple’s iPad and iPhone
was originally invented by state
funded or state owned organisations.
Without the US military, DARPA,
and CERN it’s unlikely the iPad
would exist today. If a state owned
agency invented and produced this
sort of technology in the future,
luxury could be available to all.
Fully automated luxury
communism isn’t a totally new
idea; it’s the communism of the
past reapplied in the context of the
21st
century, taking full advantage
of technological progress. It’s
a fascinating ideology that’s
completely incompatible with
Labour ideals. I’m now realising
that I might be in the wrong party.
The
technologies
we create
could cause
social
upheaval

society’s
ultimate
collapse

Filibuster foils first aid – fair?

ast Friday, a group of
Conservative MPs killed a
bill intended to make first
aid training compulsory
in state-run secondary schools by
“talking it to death.”
The thrillingly-named
Compulsory Emergency First
Aid Education (State-funded
Secondary Schools) Bill – which
tells you everything you need to
know about the bill in one snappy
title – would have effectively added
first aid training to the national
curriculum, especially CPR and the
use of defibrillators.
Because it was a Private Member’s
Bill, put forth by Labour MP Teresa
Pearce, there was only a limited
amount of time available for debate,
which was apparently invitation for
a collection of miserable, common-
sense-hating MPs to spend the

entire debate spouting absolute
nonsense.
A bill backed by St John’s
Ambulance, the British Red Cross,
and the British Heart Foundation
– by far the three biggest charities
responsible for promoting first
aid to the masses – was killed by
Conservative MPs using childish,
antiquated tactics that have no place
in our parliamentary system.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Makingfirstaidpartofthenational
curriculum is an undeniably great
idea, because having more people
who know the fundamentals of how
to save a life can only be a good
thing.And Conservative MPs chose
to talk the bill to death.The reasons
they gave were nothing short of a
piss-take. I mean, seriously, take this
steaming pile of premium manure
(courtesy of the Independent) from
Philip Davies MP, who appears to
be the Member of Parliament with
responsibilities for Being a Giant
Ass-Wipe:
“Among reasons he listed for
blocking the bill was that himself
had been taught first aid in
school but had forgotten what
he was taught. He also said the
Government should not expect
teachers to assume a “pseudo-parent
role”, and that he did not want
“the Government to be sticking
their nose in at every turn trying to
lecture [teachers] every five minutes
that they should be doing this, that,
and the other”.”
The fact that you can’t remember
your (non-compulsory) first aid
lessons from school is not a valid
reason to deny it to children
now. The fact that a Member of
Parliament is a old man with
difficulties remembering something
from his childhood should not be a
reason for depriving children of an
extremely valuable life skill.
Teaching first aid isn’t remotely
“pseudo-parenting.” I have zero
comprehension of how this is an
argument against the bill. Equally,
I fail to see how adding this to
the national curriculum would be
“sticking [one’s] nose in at every
turn.” It’s a simple and potentially
life-saving addition. Michael Gove
tried far,far worse when he was busy
dicking about with the curriculum.
But let’s leave Philip Davies to his
opinions. This filibuster (and it very
much is that) was beyond moronic,
but it’s provided a flag to an element
of the democratic process that is
painfully in need of reform.
Yes, the filibuster exists in other
governments, most notably the US
Senate, but there it has power and
meaning, and acts as an effective
check (amongst many,many others).
The UK equivalent is a watered-
down, weedy version that fails to act
as a check on the government in any
way, shape or form, and is simply a
means to kill off bills unsupported
by the Government.
It’s beyond time for the filibuster
to be reformed – it’s not only this
bill that has been killed off in
this manner (or indeed by Philip
Davies, who has a horrific fondness
for this sort of behaviour), and
unsurprisingly there is now a
petition for the Government to
reform the rules on filibustering.
Created by Dr Alex Langford, the
petition currently has just over
29,000 signatures, meaning the
Government is required to respond.
If it hits 100,000, it’ll be considered
for debate in Parliament (and if it is,
no doubt Mr Davies will attempt to
filibuster it).
Dr Langford on the petition’s
aims:“Lowering the number of MPs
needed to win a vote on a motion
for closure, or limiting the length
of speeches in certain sessions,
would be options for reform worth
considering.”
This is not a demand to remove
the filibuster. It can have its uses,
but in moderation, not just every
Friday afternoon, and not by
someone who was taught to do it
because their political mentor “did it
for fun”. Take a look at the petition.
Sign it. It may not sound like much,
and it’s not going to change the
world, but it will make a difference.
And if it means more bills like
the Compulsory Emergency First
Aid Education (State-funded
Secondary Schools) Bill – as unsexy
as that name might be – get passed,
it will have been so, so worth it.
