Union spends five grand on a desk
T
his week it came to
light that the union has
spent something in the
region of £20,000 on
the refurbishment of its own office
spaces, £5100 of which was spent
on a new light-up reception desk.
Other monumental costs included
£1266 on the removal and disposal
of the old reception desk, £4180
on the new glass separating the
SAC from staff desks, and the new
stickers adorning the area between
Metric and FiveSixEight, which
cost £1640 to create and install.
It is unclear whether this last cost
included the price of the perspex
added to the wall to protect the
adornments.

In a controversial redevelopment of the union offices, thousands of pounds were
spent on stickers, a light-up reception desk and a glass wall
The stickers appeared at the start
of this term, and offer a mind-
boggling viewing experience to
those queueing for the cloak room or
trying to get into Metric. Passers-by
have called the display,“disorienting
and gaudy”, “patronising” with one
simply saying, “vile”.
This comes as I, Science, a
Guardian student media award-
nominated Imperial publication,
had its £3000 budget slashed to zero
by the union at the end of last year.
As the periodical was mostly run by
Science Communication students,
that department now covers the
costs.
The union president told FELIX:
“The Union is proud to invest
millions of pounds each year in
enhancing the student experience
of our members. Investing £4000 a
year for the next five years in making
our building more welcoming, and
the Officer Trustees and staff more
accessible is just one small part of
that investment.”
FELIX is unaware as to whether
these figures include Value Added
Tax.
The union’s annual report was
released this week too.Staff numbers
were up this year from 52 in 2014
to 54 this year, although student
staff fell from 132 to 126. Despite
this, the amount the union was
paying out in wages had increased
by £176,000 from 2014. The report
also showed one staff member was
earning over £80,000 this year,
whereas last year, likely the same
individual, was earning between
£70,000 and £79,999.
Although wages, funding for I,
Science, and flashy desks all come
from different pots of money, the
union has still made the choice to
spend a pretty hefty amount of cash
on what most would agree was an
eyesore. The going rate for fancy
curved wooden reception desks,
and we’re talking a few steps up
from IKEA here, is around one or
two grand, so the union certainly
could’ve been more frugal.
At union council on the 27th
of October questions were raised
about the union’s redevelopment,
including the vague costs, lack
of student consultation and the
changes to Student Activities
Centre (SAC), which many clubs
have found difficult. Chris Kaye,
the union’s Deputy President of
Finance and Services, was actioned
to report on the costings of the
union redevelopment to Council.
The union’s president was actioned
to “look into communications
with students over developments
in the Union that directly impact
the student volunteers”. The next
union council meeting is on the 8th
of December. Any Imperial student
can attend.

This is not a real receipt, obviously. We did get all the above figures legitimately
from union sources, though. These figures may include VAT that can be claimed
back by the union. What could your club have done with five grand?
club is assigned £10 of printer credit.
This works like standard college
printer credit, and has the same
pricing structure. Several clubs,
especially those with lots of music
to print, have expressed dismay at
the new system.
Although there is a form the
union has provided for claiming
back lost personal funds, sources
from MTSoc amongst others told
FELIX: “It’s too difficult to print in
the way the union has suggested.The
only other option, screenshotting
print logs and sending them to the
union for verification, seems like a
time consuming, needless effort for
all involved.”
Another added, “It’s a change
that’s hit some clubs’ members
harder than others.”
