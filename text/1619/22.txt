Rugby 1st
XV: Back to their winning ways

IC beat Kent at home 21-12
I
C 1st
XV arrived at an
incredibly windy Harlington,
the flat surroundings doing
nothing to shield the boys
from the gales. Nevertheless, the
warm-up went smoothly, with not
one ball dropped and everyone
seeming ready for a fight.
IC’s CPS started. A strong run
from Kent’s hooker and two fall-
off tackles later, Kent were bearing
down in IC’s 22. A fast few phases
from Kent’s forwards and a quick
ball out to the backs saw Kent score
a try not even five minutes into the
game. Shock and disappointment
was ubiquitous with most of the
team wondering how on earth
they were going to impress the
RVC Netballers that night if they
didn’t win. This, and the odd word
of inspiration from the captain,
spurred the boys into gear.
A strong restart from our fly-half
positioned the forwards deep in
opposition territory. A penalty was
given right in front of the posts.
Centre, Sam Moorby, stepped up,
somehow managing to send it right
off the posts with a kick as pitiful as
his hairline.
The lineouts were going brilliantly
despite the gale-force winds. Strong
phase play carried by flanker and
banter factory, Alex Clayton, saw
Second Row, Toby Simpson, crash
over the whitewash for IC’s first try.
Moorby converted, making up for
his atrocious first attempt.
Another bit of brilliant play
resulted in Imperial crashing back
up the pitch, leaving their boot
inches away from Kent’s private
parts. Ali Zaboronsky lashed out at
the ref’s ankle, seeking to remove
any competition with the ladies that
evening.
Scrum half, Matthew Blackett,
organised well and questioned the
Kent defence with lots of darting
runs. The forwards were carrying
really well in tight pods with author
of this article, Clayton, leading the
charge, almost as if he were a man
of average height. Kent struggled
with his silky smooth footwork,
dashing good looks and straight
arm denying their tackles.
Quick ball from the scrum and
some more great rucking resulted in
Simpson’ssecondtry. Thebackswere
starting to look really dangerous
and Moorby soon got a try of his
own. Both conversion attempts
were successful, bringing the score
to 21-5. Simpson seemed eager to
score another five, unfortunately
blowing his load prematurely and
dropping the ball over the line. Low
morale ensued from a blatant hat-
trick avoidance.
Kent’s winter bulk programme
had evidently been more effective
than ours as they dominated the
scrum. Kent used this to their
advantage, crossing over the line
to score their second try. If only
Martin Head’s legs were as big as
his arms,they may have been able to
hold on. Final score was 21-12 and
MOTM was deservedly awarded
to Alex Clayton for an outstanding,
nay astonishing performance.

Free Yoga, Boxing and Pilates are all part of the event’s kick-off next week
F
rom this Monday, Imperial
College London will be
revelling in all things
female as part of their
#ImperialGirlsCan campaign.
Sport Imperial and Imperial College
Union have joined forces to spend a
week celebrating the achievements
and successes of female athletes at
the college.
The week will begin with
Motivation Monday, starting early
in the day with a ‘DJ spin class’
featuring songs from all-female
groups and singers.This will include
all the classics, from the Spice Girls
to Beyoncé.
Appetising Tuesday will include
the ‘Let’s Talk About Food’
nutrition session hosted by the
Ethos Active Lifestyles team. This
session will challenge perceptions
of media icons and provide handy
hints and tips on what we should
and should not be eating.
Winning Wednesday will pitch
our #ImperialGirlsCan alongside
the BUCS #ThisBUCSGirlCan
campaign. Across the sports sites,
we will have a huge number of our
female sports teams bidding to take
away that all-important WIN as
the season enters its halfway point.
What better way to celebrate after
gaining that win than at the ‘ACC
Sports Night’ in the Union?
If you’re feeling a little fragile from
Wednesday night, then why not
pick up a spot in the ‘Old School
Sports Day’? Expect some of your
old favourites such as the egg and
spoon and three-legged race where,
fingers crossed, by lunchtime you’ll
be able to race in a relatively straight
line!
Feel Good Friday begins with a
relaxing Pilates session – a great way
to unwind and relax. After all that
rest and recuperation, you can head
out to the ‘ICSM Cocktail Club’ to
get the weekend started.
Across the week there will be a
series of giveaways and freebies; and
boys, if you thought we had forgot
about you, think again.
For a full range of the activities
taking place across the week, and to
find out how you can get involved
head to the Sport Imperial website
or alternatively join the Facebook
Event ‘#ImperialGirlsCan Week’ to
keep up to date with all the action!
