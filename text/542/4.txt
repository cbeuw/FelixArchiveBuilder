Sir
O n M o n d a y evening, I C U
C o u n c i l asked the Permanent
W o r k i n g Party to look into the
College B o o k s h o p .
Prices, availability of books
and the range of stationery
offered for sale will be studied
carefully. I ask your readers to
forward to me, at the address
below, their criticisms of any
aspect of the Bookshop. This
will h e l p the P W P a n d the
B o o k s h o p to work together to
provide an improved service.
T h a n k you
Y o u r s sincerely

Dear Sir
I r e a l l y t h o u g h t I'd b e e n
moving quickly lately, but it
looks like I ran head-on into a
handful of muck (slung from a
most unexpected quarter) with
the old Ents letter, and now I'd
b e t t e r t r y a n d r e m o v e any
clinging residue, I suppose.
W h e n I was C h a i r m a n of a
S C A B C l u b (1978-79) I was
never sure why IC Ents had
t h e s a m e s t a t u s a s s a y ,
Debating Society. I still think
this is worth looking at, though
I withdraw (with suitable slime)
any damaging remarks betraying
preconceived ideas.
Y o u r s faithfully

I w o u l d like to thank the person
w h o b o r r o w e d m y scarf a couple of
weeks ago for leaving it in the
M a t h s Party (I certainly did not
9°)-
I hope it kept him/her w a r m
during his period of use of my
scarf.
T h a n k you also to Kirsten for
having it returned to me.

Dear Colin
I f e e l I m u s t w r i t e t o
c o m p l a i n a b o u t the w a y in
which the recent U G M was
reported in last week's F E L I X .
Firstly, the coveted front page
feature was devoted to 'Life O n
A G r a n t ' , a n d w a s m a i n l y
concerned with new information
not even brought up at the
meeting.
T h e n inside we were treated
to not one, but two anonymous
persons views on the meeting,
both mainly concerned with
s a r c a s t i c c o m m e n t s a b o u t
apathy and general bitching at
the Exec.
I a m fortunate in that, having
attended the meeting myself, I
know what went on, but I'm
sure if I hadn't I would have
b e e n v e r y c o n f u s e d a n d
probably m u c h put off by the
trivialisation of most of what
w e n t o n . W i t h r e p o r t s like
t h e s e is it s u r p r i s i n g t h a t
U G M s are "attended by the
slightly confused faithful few"
to quote the first anonymous
a u t h o r ( o r s h o u l d I s a y
authoress as I expect it was a
M s ) , or that "those that attend
have become hardened to the
idea that they are just talking
shops" to quote the second.
Surely it would be better to
have an official report by a
F E L I X news reporter, giving
the facts, ie what actually went
on, in the most clear, concise
a n d p r e f e r a b l y u n b i a s e d
manner possible, and leave the
M r ( M s ) X s t o a i r t h e i r
personal views on the letters'
page — they might even have
the courtesy to put their names
to it there.

Eds Comment
The UGM report was
written by our News Editor.
The 'Not A UGM Report' is
traditionally written by our
'Internal Affairs Correspondent'.
The names of the students
who hold these positions on
the newspaper, have been
published in FELIX this term.
The front page included
interviews with student
representatives from both sides
of the grants argument and
ends with an overall comment
from the NUS President.
Dear Colin
I should like to explain my
opposition of the grants motion
at the last U G M as I do not
feel it was adequately summa-
rised in F E L I X last week. The
point I was making was that, as
we are frequently reminded the
money which the Government
s p e n d s h a s to c o m e f r o m
somewhere. In asking for an
increase in grants and, in the
s a m e b r e a t h , a d v o c a t i n g no
cuts to the education budget,
we are demanding money on
two accounts which does not
give t h e a p p e a r a n c e of a n
a w a r e n e s s of the s i t u a t i o n .
There must be some give and
take on both sides and, although
I was being idealistic in sug-
gesting students could possibly
accept a short term decrease
in grants, I do believe that the
full g r a n t , as it is n o w , is
perfectly adequate for a student
to live on and I do not think it is a
matter of going without luxuries
— who else at our age can afford
to drink in the bar every night or
go out to theatres—concerts—
cinemas—night clubs several
times a week?
In demanding more money
for students you are removing
any credibility that the cuts
campaign has established in
t h a t o u r c r i t i c i s m s a r e n o
l o n g e r c o n s t r u c t i v e . I w a s
appalled to read that the only
resolution that came out of the
recent N U S conference was to
d e m a n d a 3 6 % i n c r e a s e i n
student grants and that there
w a s n o d e c i s i o n m a d e to
actively and constructively fight
the cuts. I would be bitterly
disappointed to see I C U adopt
adopt the same approach.
Y o u r s sincerely

Dear Sir
What is a U n i o n H a c k ?
A t the last U n i o n C o u n c i l
m e e t i n g t h a t q u e s t i o n w a s
asked (and never answered)
w h e n it was p r o p o s e d that
attempts should be made to
i n v o l v e n o n - h a c k s i n . U n i o n
affaris.
" W e need to have ordinary
students on our U n i o n commit-
tees to represent the views of
the ordinary students."
What is an ordinary student?
A non-hack.
Somebody who gets involved
in t h e U n i o n a n d s i t s o n
committees.
C a t c h 22. Y o u can't have
ordinary students on commit-
tees to represent the views of
ordinary students.
People call me a hack. D o I
take it as a compliment or an
insult? Even if I take it as a
compliment, was it meant as an
insult? A n d if it is an insult,
w h a t is w r o n g w i t h getting
involved in the Union?
W o u l d an ordinary student
please answer these questions?
But I've fallen into the trap too.
If an ordinary student writes a
letter to F E L I X answering me,
he or she is getting involved in
Union affairs and must therefore
be a hack.
