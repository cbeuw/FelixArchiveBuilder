Contact week is an annual event organised by the West
Chaplaincy. The Chaplaincy operates in three colleges in West
London: Impend College, The Royal College of Music and Queen
Elizabeth College. We exist as a network of small groups which
meet regularly in the halls of residence and student houses, and
at lunchtimes in college departments.
During Contact Week each group of students acts as host to
one of the members of the team. As you can see, the team are a
varied and interesting bunch of people who are bringing their
insight and their experience of the outside world to the various
informal discussions and meetings which will be happening around
them.
The team are not coming just for the benefit of regular
members of the Chaplaincy but to stimulate thought and
discussion about personal, ethical and religious questions in the
halls and departments where they are based, and to respond to
the issues you might want to raise.
The Contact Week team are not coming to recruit or convert
people — that's not the Chaplaincy's style — but they will be
happy if their presence this week helps to activate and catalyse
some fresh understanding and new growth in the people they
meet. So look out for the notices in your hall or department and
come along and join in. You will find us open to your point of
view, as well as willing to give you ours.
