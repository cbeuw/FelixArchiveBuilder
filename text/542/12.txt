Congratulations to the Guilds men for winning
the pedal car race today. Mines won the women's
event so hounours were shared. The Football Club
P. Artists won the R C S Soccer sixes at Harlington
last Sunday with Batmobiles winning the Mines
Rugby Sevens.
Sorry for making you sit through a boring
Nationwide, last Friday, (complete with the World's
worst poet and Haggis!). The B B C have pencilled in
next Tuesday night as a rough date for transmitting
the Ladies rugby team on Nationwide.
The rest of the term looks full of fun for all of us.
Will ICWA survive next Tuesday's U G M . Will ICU
boycott the Olympics in a fit of Meglamania? Come
to the U G M in the Concert Hall at 1 pm. and find
out.

Introducing a new society (not another
one) dedicated to what most students
seem to do a lot of anyway â€” drinking
coffee. S o w h o needs a society to help
them do it? W e l l , firstly, it might help
some of y o u out there realise that there is
m o r e to drinking coffee than pouring hot
water over your Nescore. Basically, it's
function will be similar to that of the W i n e
T a s t i n g S o c i e t y , t r y i n g o u t d i f f e r e n t
blends of coffee, secondly, I hope that the
informal atmosphere of normal coffee-
d r i n k i n g c a n be m a i n t a i n e d , p r o b a b l y
t a k i n g p l a c e i n m e m b e r s r o o m s , if
numbers permit, encouraging people from
all over College, especially those in 'digs'
w h o don't seem to involve themselves in
the more organised 'Ents'.
S o what's so great about coffee? Y o u
may not think there is m u c h to it, but this
society will set out to prove otherwise,
allow me to explain. Instant coffee takes
the beans from the coffee bush, roasts
them fairly lightly, grinds them, brews the
powder so p r o d u c e d , and then dries the
brew either by boiling the water away, or
freeze dried. This process produces the
powder familiar to most of us, leaving all
the sediment behind, w h i c h can be turned
back into coffee with hot (not boiling)
water thus leaving no sediment in the
cup. F r e e z e drying is better, but both
processes lose m u c h of the flavour and
aroma. If y o u smell a cup of instant
coffee, y o u will probably merely smell the
w a r m milk.
T h e surprising thing is that with very
little extra effort, or money, y o u can
make a far better c u p of coffe. If y o u use
the ground bean, instead of the dried
brew, a n d brew it yourself, the resulting
c u p will a c t u a l l y taste a n d s m e l l like
coffee. T h e problem of sediment can be
overcome in a number of ways. Either
filter the brew, using a funnel a n d paper,
percolate it, or use coffee bags. Coffee
bags tend to be expensive, and percolation
gives t h e coffee a taste y o u either like or
hate, personally I hate it, so I tend to use
a 'Melita' funnel and papers, which are
available in most department stores.
O n e other problem with real coffee is
that it does not keep, about seven to ten
days for ground coffee, and two weeks if
y o u buy the roasted bean, and grind it
yourself, after this the coffee begins to
lose its a r o m a and flavour, so obviously
buy a little coffee, often.
Supply is no problem. M o s t super-
markets sell the L y o n s brands, but for
freshly ground coffee, the best source is
Fern's, 27 Rathbone Place which is just
off the Tottenham C o u r t R o a d end of
O x f o r d Street, who d o a whole range of
blends and roasts (as well as many types
of tea). T o really enjoy a c u p of coffee, it
should be drunk black, without sugar, this
isn't snobbish, just plain good sense. After
all, how can you taste the coffee if all y o u
can tast is the milk and sugar? If you
really can't do without them, real coffee is
still w o r t h w h i l e . R e a l coffee is m u c h
stronger than instant and thus is very
useful if y o u have to b u r n the midnight oil
( a b o u t o n e c u p per h o u r is u s u a l l y
enough to keep you awake). H o w e v e r ,
strong coffee is addictive (I get blinding
ICU SELL YACHT
A t the A C C G e n e r a l M e e t i n g last
Tuesday, the decision was taken to ask
I C U to sell the College yacht, Impetus,
s i n c e t h e b o a t h a s p r o v e d t o be a
constant drain on U n i o n funds and has
been of very little use to the Y a c h t C l u b
merrtoers.
Since being bought in 1977, the boat
has suffered from severe problems arising
from faults in the manufacture of the hull,
which have resulted in Impetus being
unsafe and therefore unusable.
T h e final straw came when, after losing
her rudder in heavy seas in August, the
boat was dried out and allowed to stand
on her keel, (a normal enough procedure)
and the keel nearly came through the
bottom.
T h e i n s u r e r s h a v e r u l e d t h a t t h e
damage so caused was due to a fault in
the building of the keel supports and
Michael A r t h u r is at present trying to
obtain the money for necessary repairs
from C o r a l Marine, who supplied the
yacht new to the U n i o n .
After it became obvious that Impetus
would not sail again this year, the Y a c h t
C l u b has decided to switch its activities
and charter yachts instead.

headaches if I stop drinking the stuff) but
since no one has ever found any side
effects, that isn't going to stop me!
If you've read this far, y o u must be
interested in ccoffee, so let me tell you a
little bit about the stuff. M o s t coffee is a
blend of coffees from different parts of
the world. Here are the main types. They
fall into two main types, A r a b i c a , which
gives the coffee its m a i n t a s t e , a n d
Robusta, which keeps the cost down and
takes away the bitterness of some of the
stronger types. M a i n types of A r a b i c a are:
K e n y a n , Costa R i c a , M o c h a , S a n t o s ,
C o l u m b i a n , a n d Indian.
A popular blend is ' M o u n t i a n Blend'
which is a mixture of central A m e r i c a n
c o f f e e s , but the n u m b e r of b l e n d s is
v i r t u a l l y l i m i t l e s s . A l s o t h e f l a v o u r
depends o n the roast, from light, which
produces a very mild cup to a 'continental
roast which produces a strong cup, but
t e n d s t o m a s k s o m e of t h e s u b t l e r
flavours.
S o this is where Coffsoc comes in.
E v e r y m e e t i n g , if p o s s i b l e we'll t r y a
d i f f e r e n t b l e n d or r o a s t , a n d a l l o w
members to m a k e up their o w n minds as
to what they like. I sincerely hope there
will be no snobbishness in this society, if
after going to some of our meetings, y o u
still prefer instant, with milk and sugar,
that's fine. H o w do y o u join? Just contact
any of the below, <and we'll see if there is
enough interest to get going (you might
even get a free c u p of coffee, if y o u ask
nicely).
