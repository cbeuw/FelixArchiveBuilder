"LAST YEAR WE ASKED
FOR YOUR MONEY -
THIS YEAR
WERE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP."
Many of you may by now have seen around
College, posters bearing this title. What is it
all about?
Providence (Row) Nightshelter and Refuge
is a large, rambling building in Crispin Street,
E1, built by a local priest in 1860 to provide
much needed succour to the poor and
homeless of Victorian London. Readers of
Dickens' novels will understand something of
the sould destroying conditions of poverty,
hunger and homelessness that he set out to
improve. It would be nice to think that now,
after o n e h u n d r e d a n d t w e n t y y e a r s ,
Providence Row"s work is complete, but
sadly, this is not so. Various estimates
ranging up to 20,000 have been made of the
number of homeless currently on London's
streets. That's right, at this moment there may
be 20,000 men and women within twenty
miles of here with nowhere to live and nothing
to keep them warm and dry save an old
cornflakes box and yesterday's Evening
Standard. Providence Row provides meals
and beds for up to seventy-five such people
each night. More importantly, the workers
there interview each person admitted to
d e t e r m i n e the c a u s e of his (or her)
homelessness. Once that is known, steps can
be taken to remedy it.
You may be aware that, when signing on for
the dole or social security, one has to give an
address. Without an address it is almost
impossible to get any money. Without money
it is generally impossible to find anywhere to
live. Providence Row breaks this vicious
circle by providing an address from which
residents can "sign on". This is a crucial first
step to rehabilitation. The next step is to try to
find the root cause of homelessness; this may
vary from the demon drink through a whole
range of broken family problems to mental
disorders. By providing support for each
individual, backed by profesional help from
i n t e r n a l a n d o u t s i d e s o c i a l s e r v i c e s ,
Providence Row aims to return him (her) to a
normal life within one or two months of
admittance.
How can we help?
Providence Row is entirely supported by
voluntary donations. No money is demanded
from residents on entry (although once
"signed on", the social security department
pays something towards accommodation
costs). At present five full-time workers and
one administrator are employed and most of
the day to day running of the Refuge is
carried out by the Sisters of Mercy.
The Joint Chaplaincies of West London
University have adopted Providence Row as
the subject of their Charity Appeal 1979-80.
As well as fund raising we are organising
volunteers to go to work at Providence Row.
Usually this means helping with serving
meals and talking to residents (it can mean a
lot to a person who is really down on his luck
to feel that someone else cares and is willing
to listen). We would like to hear from anyone
who could go regularly, say once a week or
fortnight, to help for an evening between
about 5:30 and 9:00 or 10:00pm.
We are also organising a sponsored walk
on 8th March. A similar event last year raised
£3,000. With your help we could do even
better this year. The walk will take place in
lovely country near Guildford, Surrey and
e a c h y e a r p r o v e s to be an e x c e l l e n t
opportunity to meet new faces as well as
renewing old acquaintances.

could help Providence Row, please contact

Marchetti at More House, 53 Cromwell Road
