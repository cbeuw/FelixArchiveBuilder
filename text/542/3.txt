under £100, this powerful machine brings
personal computing within the range of
most students. A l s o o n display, although
in a m u c h higher price bracket, was the
D A I personal computer, shown to the

on display playing C h e s s , a n d moving the
pieces itself by means of a small crane.
W e were surprised to find that one firm
at the show, S I R A , was made up almost
entirely from ex-IC students. W e hope to
arrange a talk from a member of S I R A s
design team later in the year.

POST GRADUATE
COURSE IN THE SUN
The need for a better understanding of
construction materials by civil engineering
graduates is to be met by the Harry Stanger
[ Laboratories, who have agreed to run a series
j of two-week courses on materials technology
• at their training college in Malta, starting in
\ March 1980.
As the foremost materials testing, investigating
* and consulting laboratory specialising in the
building and construction industry, Stangers
originally set up the training college in Malta to
meet the need of emerging countries in Africa,
the Middle East and Asia for qualified materials
technologists and engineers. At the suggestion
of some U K universities and several of the
larger construction companies, the extensive
facilities and specialist staff at Malta are to be
made available to British students in a series of
two-week postgraduate courses in practical
materials technology.
In view of tightening legislation on liability for
defects and failure to comply with legal or
contractual specifications a n d the general
proliferation of new building materials and
methods, it is felt that there is now a need for
students to gain p r a c t i c a l e x p e r i e n c e of
laboratory and site testing before embarking on
their career.

O n Tuesday a contingent of M i n e r s
(wearing suits!) visited the L o n d o n Metal
Exchange. Privileged to watch from the
floor, they watched the world prices of
copper, tin, lead, zinc, silver, aluminium
and nickel being determined in the five
minute dealing sessions towards the end
of which the dealers tend to become a
trifle emotional!

O n the 15th we all troop d o w n to
C a m b o r n e for the sporting weekend, the
highlight of which is the Bottle M a t c h . In
this game the rugby teams play for the
two foot high tin bottle which was given
by W h i t b r e a d in 1 9 1 1 . It is k e p t o n
display behind the U n i o n bar. It seems
that tickets for the weekend are all sold,
but still keep your ears pinned back for
any spares.

The cost of the course is £200 and the
C o l l e g e c a n a r r a n g e a c c o m m o d a t i o n for
fourteen days ranging from £81 in self-catering
flats to £154 in local hotels. T h e fee includes
temporary membership of the the local sports
and social club (from sailing, diving, para-kiting
and riding to folk dancing and discos) and free
transport from the mediaval town of Vittoriosa
to the Old Armoury, where the college is
housed.
Return charter flights (Gatwick — Luga) can
be arranged through Stangers, but arrangements
are also being made for future courses for a four-
week overland package, taking small mixed
groups 'on safari' down and back through France
and Italy.
Indications are that many of the students will be
sponsored by construction companies who are
finding the cost a worthwhile investment to give
their g r a d u a t e intake a s o u n d p r a c t i c a l
grounding.
Full details and application forms are available
from Mr E F Lewis at Harry Stanger Ltd, Fortune
Lane, Elstree, Herts, W D 6 3QR (tele 01-207-3191).
