ICCAG
After last week's quota of undisguised
obscene smut from Giovanni Casabianca
(John Whitehouse — for you budding
Italian scholars), I have to report that we
are still here, and there is still lots for you
to do to find out what different people in
London need done for them. If you live far
away — so what? We'll still give you a cup
of coffee and try to find out if there is
anything near where you live — be it
Pinner or Mile End or Ealing, which needs
your enthusiastic help. The coffee's free
but the advice is valuable. Monday dinner-
times, 3rd floor of the Union.
For those of you nearer IC, Soup runs to
tramps on Tuesdays and Fridays meet
Falmouth Kitchens at 10:30pm. Task Force
see Sunila Nimalaswiya Maths 2 — visiting
old age pensioners. Holly St Adventure
playground tomorrow (or Saturday 2nd
February — sorry, but I doubt you, Colin)
10:00am Beit Arch. Visiting Great Ormond
Street Hospital and lots more for all the
family free. Now beat that.

HANG-GLIDING
CLUB
At last! We're off the ground, on Sunday
20th February after immense hassle the
first flight of the club's glider was achieved.
Having bought a Vortex hang-glider at the
end of last term four of us set out for
sunny Brighton to have it test flown and to
have a go ourselves. We arrived at a site
known as Mill Hill to find no gliding in
progress due to lack of wind, so we moved
on to Steyning Boul. Here we met up with
Graham Slater who this year won the
individual trophy in the American Cup (an
international competition, possibly the top ,
competition of the year in H G terms).
Graham then decided that Mill Hill would
be a better site to fly due to the wind speed
rising a little.
Returning to Mill Hill, we rigged the
glider and as the wind was now strong
enough Graham took off. After a short
flight he OK'ed the glider and it was our
turn!
However disaster attempted to strike: as
we were preparing for flight the glider
decided to have a go on its own and
cartwheeled off the top of the hill, over a
barbed wire fence, a road and finally
another fence before stopping, fortunately
undamaged.
Back on the hill top we found that the
harness we had was too long, however our
Safety Officer, Dave Roberts decided to
have a go and promptly piled in on take off
having decided to fly prone (lying down) in
a seated harness! Nice one Dave.
Our resident expert, Tore Christianson
took off next in nil wind for a superb
ICHGC first flight. The day finished with
some ground runs to get the feel of the kite
by me and Al Dempsey our President, who
attempted a run with his helmet on the
wrong way round! (he is half Irish!). All in
all an interesting first flying outing for the
club, hopefully to be followed by many
more.

PHOTSOC
There will be a Print Competition on Tuesday
5th February, at 7:00pm in RSM 303. Each person
may enter up to five prints (colour or black and
white), which may have been commerically
processed. There will be a small entrance fee of
20p per person. There will be prizes for first,
second and third places.
The Photosoc Shop is now open every Tuesday
from 12:30 to 1:30 in the Old Darkroom (location
of which is on the Photsoc Noticeboard next to
Men's Lavatory in Union Building).
FENCING
Fencers with some experience can come along to
the University of London Fencing Club, 3rd floor
Union Building, Malet Street on Tuesdays
between 5:00pm and 7:30pm.
Free professional coaching (AFA Club Coach),
good competition and your chance to fence for
the University of London.
PRODUCTION
CAR TRIAL
On Sunday 10th February, City and
Guilds Motor Club will be holding a
production car trial in a disused chalk pit.
There will be about a dozen tests in all, of
two types. The majority will be distance hill
climbs which tests how far up a steep,
loose surface a competitor can drive
without touching the canes marking the
course. There will also be autotests, which
are timed tests of a driver's skill in
negotiating a tight course round bollards
and include reversing.
There is very little risk of damage to
competing cars because there is almost
nothing to hit or roll over at the chalk pit.
In addition, the loose surface minimises
tyre and t r a n s m i s s i o n wear on the
autotests, where competitors may use
handbrake turns, etc, in their manoeuvring.
There is also plenty of opportunity for a bit
of freelance sideways motoring between
the tests, so it's a good opportunity to learn
skid and spin control safely.
If you are interested, have a look at the
pictures of last term's PCT on the motor
club noticeboard on level three of Mech
Eng or have a word with any motor club
committee member in Guilds' Union Office.
We will need marshals, as well as competitors
so come along even if you don't have a car.
The entry fee will probably be three
pounds per competitor.
