SAILING CLUB
IC vs Oxford University
L a s t S a t u r d a y , Imperial C o l l e g e
sailing team travelled lip to Oxford, ,for
the first away match of the year,
h o p i n g to c o m p l e t e a d o u b l e over
Oxford University, who were defeated
at t h e W e l s h H a r p in N o v e m b e r .
Conditions were light, but improved
during the first race, which Oxford
won by securing second, third and
forth positions. In the second race, IC
held first, third and fourth places, but
having taken two two point penalties
for rule infringements, the position
was not good enough. Some close
racing resulted on the last leg of this
race, with IC pulling through to first,
second and forth and so winning the
match by half a point.
T e a m : J o h n W i l l i a m s ( C a p t a i n ) ,

Murray, Nick Ajdarian, and Jill Butler.
IC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER
CLUB
On Wednesday, IC 'A' team played
L S E 'A' team at home. They won 5-0.
First onto the sacred altar was Christ,
oh sorry, Chris Tripp, who only won
117-9 to the shock of the bookies who
were' offering odds on a 147 break.
You can buy a Chris Tripp adoration
mat from Mecca (but don't go armed).
Second on was Geoff Keymer (I'm not
the only one who thinks he's cuddly
anymore, eh!). His opponent couldn't
even have beaten a two-legged Tito
puppet and Geoff won comfortably.
The next player was Dave Crossland
who was victorious even though the
opponent was related to Adam and
Eve, who's related to Mao.
S T T H O M A S ' H O S P I T A L 1 vs IC 1: 2—3
" F O O T B A L L
For the first hour of this match IC
were content to watch St Thomas'
p a s s t h e ball a m o n g s t themselves
provided they didn't enter our penalty
area, where Steve Veats would gather
the ball and kick it back to their centre
half. Then St Thomas' scored and IC
had to attack.
Immediately Ian Stevenson equalised
with a typically powerful twenty yard
d r i v e . N o t to be o u t d o n e , S l i n k y
Rickard dribbled down the left wing
and, with the defender sitting watching,
he c r o s s e d the ball into the goal
nonchalantly.
With less than ten minutes to go IC
only had to hang on to the lead. Until
Kinky Kenrick let the winger trip over
his leg to give away a penalty. A s
usual Steve " L o o k N o Hands" Veats
stood no chance with the kick.
But like all good stories there was a
happy ending, Dave Dean sportingly
allowed the defender to head the ball
clear to the feet of Andy Haralampous
who didn't kick it over the bar for a
change but deceived the goalkeeper
with t h e s o f t n e s s of his shot a n d
s c o r e d . T h i s time IC held firm to
collect two useful points.

SOUTHSIDE UPPER L O U N G E
S o next c a m e t h e f r i e n d l y , but
deadly M P for Stevenage who just
wangled a win against not too brilliant
o p p o s i t i o n . L a s t o n w a s a W O G
(Western Oriental Gentleman) whose
snooker action is as nonexistent as the
dodo. He's so brilliant he got us all
tickets for the Benson and Hedges and
forgot to get himself one! He w o n
however to keep the A side poofters
firmly entrenched at the top end of the
table.
T h e ' B ' team p l a y e d R H C . A l a n
Leclezio won his game then did a service
to humanity and beamed himself six feet
underground. T h e soppy, wet Steve
Jeans ponsed to the table next and
nearly wet himself winning. (I'd just like
to take this opportunity to say Newport
2, Cardiff 0).
Next came Andy Kresewski to whom
the steel strike has meant he can't
purchase any iron curtains (if those
Russians start a war we know
who to blame). Just for the Kremlin's
records, he lost. S o the formidable
C h r i s C a l v e r t e n t e r e d t h e s c e n e
handcuffed to his rucksack (looks like
he could do with a dose of terminal
anorexia nervosa) or am I on about
Simon Bennett? C C won and last on
was the Orson Welles of IC, Simon
Bennett, who lost.
T h e ' C t e a m w e r e at h o m e to
Charing Cross. First on was D Nuttall
who wasn't particularly P Merryment.
The way he tried to rally support was
really effective as having a bath with'
six other blokes and singing / Feel
Fine in Japan. S o the insignificant yet
pathetic Nuttall lost in superb style.
Second on was that miserable, oh so
miserable specimen of sociability Alex
Cameron (I still haven't worked out his
teeth equation). Fending off waves of
s h e e r h a p p i n e s s h e b l a s t e d h i s
opponent from here to the Khyber
Pass. I, myself and me played next
and what can you say. More exciting
than the last supper, more devastating
than a kebab and more nailbiting than
the rocket scene in Life Of Brian. Well
I don't like to beat about the point too
much since modesty is my main asset
(and also I come from Newport) but I
won. So on came Damian Kelly. T h e
crowd could hardly contain themselves,
but nevertheless he lost his second
game in a row. Last on was Graham
Curtis, who lost.
The draws have been made for the
Open and Handicap Snooker Tourna-
ment and games must be played by
the end of the first week in February.
Lessons are still available and can be
arranged for anyone interested.
