Holland, Belgium and France and appeared in a showcase half-hour spot on
WBAI-Radio, New York.
"It's quite an experience to accompany Saffron to a folk club where perhaps some
of the people might have only vaguely heard of her, and then watch the effect on
people when she sings. It really is startling, the transition from mild curiosity into
complete absorption and enjoyment. T h e n listen to the various comments afterwards,
ranging from 'Who is she?' to 'Where has she sprung from?' interspersed with such
things as ' G o o d gawd!' and 'Blimey!'. Next Monday in Lower Refectory
Folk Club present

I wish I c o u l d think of something
light-hearted a n d jovial to say about
this a l b u m . 1 w o u l d really like to
breeze through it and amuse y o u in
the process, but it cannot be done.
I admit freely to not understanding
all of it, but I k n o w one thing for
sure, a barrel of laughs it is not.
The Wall by Pink Floyd has
been nearly three years in the
making and is almost entirely
Roger Waters1
baby. The other
members hardly feature and of
them only Dave Gilmour is even
credited on the sleeve, as he co-
wrote three or four tracks and
assisted in the production.
The m e m b e r s of the group have
fled this Isle (for tax reasons) so
fast that no one got a chance to
ask them what it all means, w h i c h
is unfortunate because it is by no
means self-explanatory, in fact it is
downright obscure in places, but
what follows will be, I hope, a very
condensed analysis.
The Wall is that which we build
around ourselves, with help
from parents, teachers and
spouses, to protect ourselves
from emotional hurt. As everyone
knows, however, a wall can keep
things out but also keeps things
in, so the wall becomes a cell in
which we are isolated from
others. This happens to the
hero of the alubm, which is, by
the way, also a story. Just for
subtlety's sake we'll call him
Floyd.
In his c h i l d h o o d F l o y d is subjected
to the n o r m a l traumas, he goes to
s c h o o l a n d is b u l l i e d b y h i s
schoolmaster. H i s father leaves and
he feels rejected and w h e n he goes
to his m o t h e r for advice she helps
him build the Wall. H e grows up,
d i s c o v e r s s e x a n d m a r r i e s a
w o m a n he eventually ceases to
love. H i s violent outbursts against
his property and her, force her to
l e a v e h i m , a n d i n o n e of t h e
powerful m o m e n t s o n the a l b u m he
sings that he doesn't need her, or
anyone or anything at all anyway.
His view is that "it was all just
b r i c k s i n t h e w a l l " , w h i c h , of
course, it was.
PINK F L O Y D - T H E W A L L or A V E R Y S E R I O U S BUSINESS
On the second record we find
Floyd has become a rock star,
but still cannot make human
contact. After a few seemingly
irrelevant songs he is made to
go on stage against his wishes,
and finds himself part of a neo-
fascist group, and the audience
chants of "Pink Floyd, Pink
Floyd" sound unnervingly like
the Nuremberg Rally. Floyd
rebels against all of this and is
eventually put on trial, where
his schoolteacher, wife and
mother add their damning
testimonies that he "showed
feelings of an almost human
nature". The judge sentences
him to be "exposed before his
peers", his wall is torn down by
an enormous raging mob and
finally, as the dust settles in the
aftermath, we see a faint glimmer
of light at the end of a very dark
tunnel, a hint that there may still
be hope.
That, anyway is the story.
Musically, a Pink Floyd album can
only really be compared to other
Pink Floyd albums, and in my
opinion this one could have been
as good as Animals if only Waters
had been kept on a tighter rein by
the others in the group. If the
unnecessary stuff had been cut
out and the good condensed into
just one record, the story would
have made more sense and the
whole could have been a really
coherent work. Tracks like Hey
You, my absolute favourite of
favourties in which Floyd is cryng
out for someone to help him
break the wall, deserve better
than to be hidden away where
they are.
Comfortably Numb a n d Run Like
Hell are two of the tracks w h i c h D a v e
G i l m o u r co-wrote and stand out even
after only one or two hearings.
Engineered to s o u n d like a live
recording, Run o w e s a lot to Sheep
from Animals as far as the singing
and guitar playing go, while the lyrics
are pure paranoia. " A s the h a m m e r s
batter d o w n your d o o r / Y o u ' d better
r u n . "
by Leigh Foster
I must just mention the sleeve
which is a brilliant gatefold by
Gerald Scarfe. The outside
shows an anonymous wall but
inside through holes we can see
the final sentence being executed
in a stadium that could swallow a
hundred Wembleys. Ranks of
goose-stepping hammers parade
past and the hideous characters
of mother, wife and, still in an
apopletic rage, the schoolteacher
look on as the appropriately
featured Judge presides.
Y o u may think I have said a lot here,
or y o u may think I have just written a
lot of words, but either way there is
still a lot I haven't said. I haven't
mentioned the fantastic pieces of
acoustic guitar that might m o v e a less
cynical being to emotion. I have only
s k i m m e d very lightly over the surface
of the story, so if y o u want to buy the
ablum, there remains m u c h m o r e for
y o u to discover yourself. Personally it
is too expensive but I might buy a
r e c o r d M u s i c From The Wall if
anyone c a n persuade them to release
it. M a y b e I'll write to them myself,
n o w where was it they went to . . . ?
