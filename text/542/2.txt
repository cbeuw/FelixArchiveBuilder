N U K E S
O n the other side of the Atlantic, they
have tee shirts which read Nukes Puke.
N u c l e a r fuels a n d n u c l e a r p o w e r are
topics which are at present very m u c h in
vogue and with good reason; if nuclear
catastrophes are averted by one hour (ie
sixty minutes — and in seconds it sounds
even shorter), it makes a lot of people
very unhappy. Three-mile Island is the
name that comes to mind; o n the same
day that leaks of radioactive water were
discovered in California, a n idependent
team set u p b y the Nuclear Regulatory
C o m m i s s i o n i n A m e r i c a p r o d u c e d i t s
findings on the recent crisis in Pennsylvania
at Three-mile Island. This revealed that the
immediate area was saved from a 'melt-
down' of reactor fuel, and implicit in this
serious consequences for public safety
a n d h e a l t h a n d t h e e v a c u a t i o n o f
thousands by one hour and one observant
foreman at the nuclear plant. The particular
circumstances of this case are unlikely to
recur, but according to the investigating
team, unless fundamental changes in the
industry are encompassed, there is a high
risk of another similar accident.
T h e b l a m e i s l a i d a t t h e d o o r o f
management; the accident has already led
to a n extensive review of the nuclear
industry, but someone has to find the
h a p p y m e d i u m b e t w e e n r u s h i n g i n t o
decisions and sitting around and hoping.
Harking back to California with its history
of tremors and the possible huge and
damaging earthquake that seismologists
are predicting will occur in the next ten
years, it is essential that decisions, the
right decisions, are taken.
The problems with nuclear power are
numerous and notorious, the clashes with
environmentalists are well-documented;
c l o s e r t o h o m e , B r i t i s h N u c l e a r fuels
(which is state-owned) has been sparring
with the Water Authority in C u m b r i a ,
accused of selfishly trying to commandeer
w a t e r f o r t h e i r n u c l e a r fuel p l a n t at
W i n d s c a l e , w a t e r w h i c h t h e W a t e r
A u t h o r i t y w a n t t o c h a n n e l i n t o t h e
industrial west of C u m b r i a . The motion at
our last U G M o n nuclear waste being
transported through L o n d o n in containers
which have already proved unreliable is
another reflection of this. But what of
alternatives? Undoubtedly the issue will
eventually pass out of fashion; behind-the-
scenes work will still go o n , with the
g e n e r a t i o n o f n e w i d e a s a n d n e w
p r o b l e m s . J o e Q P u b l i c , f o r a l l h i s
c o n c e r n , s e l d o m offers c o n s t r u c t i v e
advice, and in the end is content to leave
it all to the experts; is he really only after
something for nothing?
F o r s o m e u n f o r t u n a t e p e o p l e , t h e
sooner the matter slips into obscurity the
better. They must be so weary of saying,
"Yes, I d o live near Three-mile Island; N o ,
I don't glow in the dark."
