Football Firsts
A F T E R a short coach trip in glorious
sunshine the first XI lined up against UC and
recorded yet another win. The conditions
made good passing difficult and it was
obvious that the team that made the least
m'. takes would win. After ten minutes, Andy
Hartland pounced on a through ball to make
it 1-0. This proved to be the decider.
IC continued to play good football for the
remainder of the first half with Elliot, Smith
and Dean combining well on the left. During
the second half, defender Mulhall was very
lucky not to be sent off for heading a boot and
then laughing at the referee. IC defended for
most of the second half, but had one or two
chances, the best falling to Bateman, who hit
the post. However, UC lacked penetration up
front and Orgasmitrov did not need to make
one difficult save.
TEAM: Organoffski, Reeve, Smith, Mulhall,
Ward, Elliot, Nicchols, Bateman, Saunders,
Hartland, Dean.
Football Seconds
A TREMENDOUS second half performance
enabled the seconds to overhaul a two goal
deficit and leave the UC ground with a well
earned point.
Early on misfortune beset IC when Lakin
pulled a hamstring and hobbled off to view
the match from the sidelines. Before the
defence had reorganised, UC were a goal up
and minutes later an unfortunate penalty was
conceded and converted to make it 0-2.
After the break however IC battled back
bravely with Veenman and Armstrong leading
many forceful forward runs. A cross from
Carr was converted by Merritt, after which a
U C attacker beat a slowly advancing IC
defence to make it 3-1.
Further misfortune struck IC when Clarke
left the field, although the whole team
continued to fight and soon cut the deficit to
3-2 after a well taken goal by Veenman. Soon
after a fierce near post shot made it 4-2 to UC.
More good midfield work enabled Esberger
to shoot from a narrow angle to reduce the
deficit to 4-3. With only five minutes from the
final whistle, a well struck shot by Merritt
squeezed under the keeper to square the
match up at 4-4.
TEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,
Lakin, Griffiths, Merritt, Clarke, Veenman,
Carr, Esberger.

Football Sixths
IC VI cruised to their third victory in three
matches against St Georges Hospital to give
them a maximum of six points out of six.
IC dominated the game from the start and
throughout the first half launched a series of
menacing attacks on St Georges goal.
Gartside, Milner, Gannaway and Roache all
came very close but the easiest chance fell to
John Chamberlain who fired Steve Davies's
cross wide from three yards. At half-time the
score was nil-nil.
During the interval, IC were given some
very large orange segments and consequently
created numerous chances. Following a
melee in the penalty area, the ball broke loose
and Mike Roache slotted the ball in from the
edge of the area. The Hariington Academicals
soon went two up when Gannaway's cross,
following a fine run from Davies, found Mike
Roache running in on the blind side of the
defence to score. IC kept up the pressue, and
the defence (Higham, Davies, Bradley and
Nagle) coped admirably *'ith any breakaways.
The Sixths scored their third goal when John
Chamberlain jinked past two defenders only
to be brought down in the penalty area.
Gartside broke the British land speed record
as he thumped the penalty in the left-hand
corner.
TEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradley, Nagle,
Davies, Milner, Tinkler, Gartside, Gannaway,
Roache, Chamberlain.

RCS Hockey
A SMALL brave band of RCS hockey players
(ten in number) took on the massed ranks of
medics from UCH (eleven players), and drew!
Biting tackles from a newly-formed side,
gradually getting over its teething problems,
made the UCH defence open wide. UCH
extracted a goal with clinical precision after a
few anaesthetising tackles by the R C S
defence. RCS probed and bored into the
cavities at the back, and, using all the gaps
got a firm hold on the game with the forwards
scraping past grinding tackles, the midfield
gobbling up every ball within spittng distance
and all defence feeding the RCS probes.
After more than one short corner, Scrope
drilled the ball into the throat of the goal to
earn RCS a worthwhile draw.
We at •
> definitely going to win next week. (I
SUDDOSI this match and article gave you
some FULFILMENT, eh Robyn? - Ed.)
Water Polo
ON Monday, October 17, the Water Polo Club
played Neptune as one of the final matches in
the Middlesex League.
Apart »rom Dave Roberts, our Captain, who
was absent due to bowel trouble, there was a
very good turnout for the occasion.
The ma1
, ch was very easy as the result
shows, notable performances from freshers
Phil Mills and Nick Buckland who each
scored, and Nick Last who managed to put
the ball in the back of the net five times.
The final score was 11-1, a comfortable win
which should ensure a place in the third
division of the league next year.
The next match is away, against Isleworth
on Friday, October 31.
T E A M : Ribar, Porter, Tayler, Smith,
Ashwin, Rackingham, Hay, Mills, Buckland,
Heffernan.

Rugby Firsts
A changed side from Wednesday's 41-3 romp
looked and smelt a little bit the worse for
wear, due to an over alcoholic Friday night.
Holloway came close to looking as pretty
as we did in their green and black hooped
shirts, but it was soon evident that IC were the
superior team. We took the lead early with a
penalty only to fall back 3-6 behind due to
Manzoni's over enthusiastic polishing of his
studs. By half-time we had scored two good
forward tries to lead 11-6.
The second half was broken up by a visiting
ambulance which removed an injured
Holloway player. However, even with a
replacement, they were unable to halt the fire
rolling mauls of the IC pack which lead to a
further three tries leaving the final score at
28-6. Ron Shaft was hard pushed to afford the
jug for his fine hat-trick of tries and was
forced to borrow £5 from coach money.
All the backs receive the 'I have no fingers
to catch the ball with' award. Despite rumours
that Smart has had a recurrence of jock-rot,
training will be on Monday as usual.
TEAM: Symes, Ratcliffe, U-Narborough,
Morgan, Pike, Fazakerley, Paxaio, Toole
Goring, King, Narby, Shaft, Lorans, Long,
Manzoni.
Football Thirds
ON Wednesday the thirds played their first
league game of the season against UC thirds.
IC got off to a good start with an early goal by
Flanagan who put the ball in the net following
a low hard shot by Dunhill. From a corner,
