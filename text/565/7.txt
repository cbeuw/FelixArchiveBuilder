IF I'DALLTHE MONEY I'VE SPENT ON DRINK,
IWOULDSPENDITON DRINK"
Certificate AA. Starring Trevor Howard,
Vivian Stanshall and Patrick Magee.
Directed by Steve Roberts. Now showing
at the Paris Pullman.
IT ISN'T very often that a significant comedy
feature surfaces from amongst the host of
glossy Hollywood imports. Fortunately, the
British film industry has not sank so low as to
stop producing the occasional gem to sweeten
the bitter pill of American domination.
'Sir Henry' is the grotesque image of English
eccentricity generated, undoubtedly, in one of
the darker recesses of Vivian StanshalPs brain.
If the name rings a bell, I should explain that
Viv is a former member of the Bonzo Dog Doo
Dah Band, whose meteoric rise to stardom in
the sixties and subsequent fragmentation may
be familiar to you. This film is the extension of
the Sir Henry theme, which was originally
serialised by John Peel, recorded on disc and
even transformed into a successful stage
p r o d u c t i o n . N o w , C h a r i s m a F i l m s h a v e
produced a screen comedy of great merit.
Before I continue I must explain my own
lack of familiarity with the said waxing; I have
no idea whether the film will offend those
already informed about the antics at Rawlinson
End. Personally, I found the screen presentation
to be both hilarious and refreshingly new.
What of the film itself? Trevor Howard gives
another exceptional performance in the lead
(indeed, on the Parkinson show he admitted it
was his most enjoyable role to date), with
strong support from Stanshall as his brother
H u b e r t a n d Patrick Magee as R e v e r e n d
Slodden.
A s far as the plot goes, suffice it to say that
I'm still not quite sure by which route the end
was reached. In a series of hilarious (if a little
confused) scenes, the lifestyle of Sir Henry and
his a s s o r t e d a c q u a i n t a n c e s is r e v e a l e d .
There's Old Scrotum, the wrinkled retainer,
Mrs E the housekeeper and another brother
(Humbert) who is prematurely dispatched to
the great beyond by accident, and comes back
to haunt Rawlinson End. For good measure
there's also Max and Joachim, two Germans
kept by Sir Henry in his own P O W camp since
the war. Various relatives complete the strange
inhabitants of Sir Henry's abode.
When Humbert appears (spiritually) once
too often, S i r H e n r y e n r o l l s R e v e r e n d
Slodden's help for an exorcism. Meanwhile
Buller Bullethead (Harry Fowler) witnesses the
various novel escape attempts of M a x and
Joachim, after his suspicions were aroused by
Sir Henry's unicycle ride to the local sewage
farm dressed as an 'impecunious jungle-
bunny'. Various other twists occur which are
far too complex to detail, but on the whole
moments of hilarious comedy shine out from
amongst the apparent confusion.
The film is now showing at the Paris Pullman
with The Running? Jumping Standing Still Film
starring Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. I'd say
it was one of those rare comic treats which are
too good to miss.

Caligula
Certificate X. Starring Malcolm
McDowell. Now showing at Prince
Charles Cinema.
A s you may have noticed, Caligula (billed as
"arguably the most controversial film ever")
o p e n e d at t h e P r i n c e C h a r l e s c i n e m a
yesterday. I had the dubious privilege of seeing
Caligula whilst I was in Amsterdam a month
ago, and I suspect that the main controversy
surrounds the claim that the highly porno-
graphic content of the film is in some way
artistic.
It begins with an idyllic scene: Caligula
(Malcolm McDowell) romping with his sister in a
soft-focus forest. All very tasteful. Tiberius
(played by a scabby-looking Peter OToole)
soon lowers the tone of the film as he lounges
beside his R o m a n Jacuzzi, surrounded by
slaves, whilst elsewhere in his villa, women are
mechancially m a s t u r b a t e d , w h i p p e d a n d
tortured, and even the guards are in danger of
being eviscerated.
However, Tiberius doesn't last long, and his
adviser, Nerva (Sir John Gielgud) commits
suicide shortly afterwards in true Roman style.
From this point onwards, with Caligula as
e m p e r o r , t h e p l o t a l t e r n a t e s b e t w e e n
executions and orgies (including the incident
when the senators wives are forced into
prostitution), all lavishly recreated, until
Caligula is assassinated a n d C l a u d i u s is
acclaimed emperor.
A number of scenes in the film — for
example, the girl performing 'deep throat', the
c l o s e - u p l e s b i a n l o v e s c e n e s a n d t h e
disembowelling — will probably have been
heavily censored, and if so, there will be very
little left (surely more interesting things were
happening in Rome).
It c o m e s as no surprise to learn that
Caligula is a Penthouse production; what is
surprising is that several well-known actors
should agree to appear in it.
Simon Hodgson
Walt Disney's
Certificate U. Starring Snow White,
Happy, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy, Bashful,
Sleepy, and Doc. Directed by David
Hand. Now showing at the Classic,
Haymarket.
In a run-up to Christmas, this 1937 feature
from Walt Disney was re-released last week.
A s the first true full-length animated film it
was an ambitious project which took just over
four years to produce, involved 750 different
artists and used about a quarter of the one
million separate drawings they produced.
Most of you will, no doubt, be familiar with
the film. It is loosely based on a Grimms fairy
tale and still seems to captivate an audience of
young and old alike. The classic "good versus
evil" plot centres on the attempts of an evil
queen to dispatch her beautiful stepdaughter,
due to mum's insane jealousy. Making the
obvious mistake of trusting the good hearted
huntsman to do her dirty work, Snow White
escapes death and stumbles across a sort of
mini-commune of seven well-rounded dwarfs.
Returning from a hard day downt' pit, the
jolly sevensome find Snow White has cleared
u p t h e i r filth a n d , a f t e r a l i t t l e s w e e t
talking/singing let her stay. However, her
black-hearted stepmother isn't finished yet.
After another chat with a very clever mirror,
she hot foots it out into the forest in the guise
of an old hag offering free bites on a poisoned
apple.
Well, needless to say, things eventually end
up happily. A few questions may pass by
younger eyes though. For instance, where on
earth did these seven little men appear from
and what happened to all the little women? Is
Snow White really so daft as to trust strange
old ladies (admittedly not Greek) bearing gifts?
Anyway, I wouldn't let such trivia bother
you. I really did enjoy this charming story. The
animation is surprisingly good and I just can't
kick whistling "Heigh-Ho" (one of the eight
songs in the film which used an 80 piece
o r c h e s t r a ) . I t ' s u n d o u b t e d l y a s o u n d
alternative to a Motorhead gig, or whatever
else you do with your spare time.
Mark Smith
S n o o i White, in a flagrant display of
favouritism, gives Dopey a smacker on his
bald patch (his head). It must have been the
combination of a baggy cloak, toothy grin and
an ability to waggle his ears which won her
over. Take note. You too could win the heart
of your own princess.
