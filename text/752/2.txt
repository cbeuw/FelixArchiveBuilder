Careers Fair
Many students, particularly
finalists, will have attended ther
Careers Fair earlier this week.
This year the event was held over
two days, and the number of
companies attending considerably
increased. It was a story of "more
of the same", however; the
additional companies were
recruiting for the same sort of
vacancies. To look at the jobs on
offer this week, and that is all that
a large number of students are
going to do, there is a very limited
range of careers receiving any
publicity.
A "small group of students"
organised a leaflet appeal asking
students to consider the
implications of a career with
military connections. At one stage
they were asked to leave the fair
by representatives of the Industrial
Society. The paper publicity may
not have carried the name of any
ICU Society, but I for one would
like to be associated with its
sentiments. Too many IC students
still follow the particularly
moronic practise of picking the
career which fits the salary they
would like to aim for. This view
may seem facile, but I have seen
too many friends drifting into
accountancy jobs after three years
of being bled of all imagination
and enthusiasm. This week's
protest was an attemt to make
those hoping to continue in
Science and Engineering think a
little more fully through the
consequences of a decision which
they may have to live with until
the grave. IC may never have
been full of idealistic students
obsessed with pacifist
philosophies, but I find the
mentallity of some of the
occupants of this "centre of
excellence" very disturbing.
Another Apology
Several members of FELIX
staff have pointed out to me that
I am frequently abusive to
students who wish to use the
office facilities. Though I am
never at my most pleasant on
Wednesdays and Thursdays, I
appreciate that my rather pushy
behaviour can be taken the wrong
way, and I sincerely apologise if I
have offended anyone.

Dear Editor,
Following the rape in Hamlet
Gardens almost a fortnight ago, the
Landlord of Hamlet Gardens,
Estate Department, etc., made
promises to increase the security of
the blocks there. As far as I, and
other residents, can see no
improvements whatsoever have
been made. Perhaps all the involved
parties are hoping that all the fuss
will blowover, despite the fact that,
apart from the rape, there was a
break-in in one of the flats in the
same week of the attack. Do we
have to wait until an even worse
crime is committed, possibly against
one of the student residents, until
improvements in security are
eventually made?
