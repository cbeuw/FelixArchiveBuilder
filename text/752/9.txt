part of government suppression
of dissent. In most cases political
detainees are at greatest risk in
the period immediately after
arrest. Such detainees have
broken down and signed false
confessions. The victims have
included mothers and children
tortured in front of each other,
mutilated and killed.
There are no circumstances
under which these abuses are
acceptable or legally permissible.
Torture violates the rule of law:
it directly contradicts the
fundamental principle that
citizens should be subject only to
prescribed penalties for proven
offences. Torture, instead, is
calculated assault. Nothing denies
our common humanity more
than the purposeful infliction of
totally unjustifiable pain and
humiliation on a defenceless
prisoner. It is to be condemned
absolutely.
What is Being Done ?
As part of its worldwide
human rights campaign, Amnesty
Internatonal opposes the torture
of all prisoners, without
reservation. It concentrates first
on getting the facts. Once it
becomes clear that torture and
ill-treatment are being inflicted
on prisoners, the organisation's
members begin appealing to the
relevant authorities to guarantee
the safety of detainees. In urgent
cases an international network of
volunteers can be alerted.
Securing proper medical
treatment for torture victims is
also part of the campaign, with
teams of Amnesty doctors
working to help refugees and
others needing mental and
physical rehabilitation. The
postcards, telegrams and parcels
are getting through. Torture has
been stopped in specific cases;
international and domestic
pressures have brought about
changes in laws and procedures
in various countries; considerable
progress has been made in the
medical treatment and
rehabilitation of victims. Much
more needs to be done

still forms an instrument of
oppression.
Human rights is an even
broader term than most people
think. Shelter, clean water, and a
fair chance to earn a living are
human rights too. When aid is
given to a country it must be
distributed fairly and it must
consist of sensible assistance
aimed at making that country
stable and prosperous in the long-
term. Any government in a
developed country which considers
subsidised weapons sales as 'aid',
or attempts to appear
compassionate by dumping some
grain on a third world country
and not caring where it goes is a
government contributing to
human rights abuse.

'When the first two
hundred letters came the
guards gave me back my
clothes. Then the next two
hundred letters came and
the prison director came
to see me. When the next
pile of letters arrived the
director got in touch with
his superior. The letters
kept coming and coming:
three thousand of them.
The President was
informed. The letters kept
arriving and the President
called the prison and told
them to let me go.'
