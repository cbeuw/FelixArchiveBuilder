A large part of Imperial College
was evacuated on Wednesday when a
suspicious brief case was discovered
in the Mines building.
The case was found at 11.55 am in
the old Security Lodge by messenger
Harry Bhat. Security Chief Geoff
Reeves was called in to examine the
case with an electronic 'sniffer'. The
device clicked rapidly suggesting
that the case may contain explosive.
By 12.03 thirty local Police and the
Bomb Squad had arrived and the
Mines, Electrical Engineering, Civil
Engineering and Mechanical
Engineering buildings were
evacuated. A Policeman outside
Mechanical Engineering told
FELIX reporters that 'steps taken
by the Police would ensure that there
would be no danger if the bomb
exploded'.
A Police explosives expert X-
rayed the case before opening it. It
was later discovered to belong to
Mining student Mark Cox who had
left the case there, for safe keeping
when he went to dinner.
Vivisection Motion Passed
New Flats
For Married
Students
The University of London Student
Union (ULU) has launched a
campaign against vivisection in
universities, following their General
Union Council (GUC) meeting on
Tuesday. The motion recieved
unanimous support, and the Union
will now take steps to ensure that
students are not pressurised into
c a r r y i n g out d i s s e c t i o n s ,
particularly on live animals.
The council is concerned that
many experiments are either
unnecessary or are used to
demonstrate known fact. They
point out that the computer models
and video equipment, such as
Bradford University's Videograph,
are cheaper and more effective than
animal experimentation.
A Students' Charter, originally
drafted by Leeds University, is being
adopted by a number of student
unions in an attempt to ensure that
students are not disciplined for
refusing to experiment on animals.
In the past students have been
penalised, and in some cases refused
their degrees, for exercising rights of
conscience. It is hoped that the
move will achieve a huge reduction
in the number of anitnal
experiments performed in London's
colleges.
The G U C agreed to oppose a
proposed fifty percent cut in
funding for London's central
university, and condemned the
support given by the Committee of
Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) for student loans, on the
grounds that they would prejudice
students from low income brackets.
- The Public Order Bill, currently
under discussion in the House of
Lords, was criticised as being a
breech of democratic freedom. The
Bill, which is also being opposed by
the National Council for Civil
Liberties, gives the Police the power
to stop any march which is
considered to be a 'serious
disruption of the life of the
community'.
A l s o criticised was the
Government's plan to include a
freedom of speech clause in the
Education Bill. The council felt that
this would jeopardise student
unions' 'no platform' policies and
would affect their rights to represent
the views of a great deal of their
members.
Support was given for the
London Child Care Campaign,
which aims to improve the creche
facilities in the University of
London (see FELIX 750). Finally, it
was decided that the 5000 print
workers sacked by Rupert Murdoch
in January should be given moral
support. U L U will now urge its
constituent universities not to buy
The Sun, News of the World, The
Times and Sunday Times.
The College has begun a
programme to build eight new flats
for married students. Four new flats
have been in use since the beginning
of term; one in 14 Princes Gardens,
one over the College shop, and two
on the lower gallery of Southside.
Three more are under construction
and should be ready by the end of
the year. The funding for the flats is
coming mostly from a central
College fund, which was set up to
deal with the problem of lack of
accomodation for married students.
The rest of the money is being
provided to cure maintenance
problems. There are plans to build
another flat in 8 Princes Gardens,
which will be ready by summer next
year.
