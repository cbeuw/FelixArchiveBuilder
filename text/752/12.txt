Clubs FELIX, Friday October 31st 1986 12
A Long Article
The London airwaves are full of
radio stations; some local, some
national, so you may ask what is
different about Imperial College
Radio. As we only broadcast to
student halls we can provide a
service that's especially tailored for
students. This year, IC Radio has
taken several steps to make sure that
its listeners get what they want. One
simple way to make sure you hear
what you want is to phone in
requests, which are usually played
within five minutes or so. To phone
us from Southside or Linstead, the
number is 89, whereas it's 72—3440
from Evelyn Gardens or just 3440
from College. Our recently started
College Events Guide means that
you'll always be in touch with what
there is to do, and well keep you in
touch with last minute changes. Our
all-time student top 50 gives us some
idea of what students want to hear,
but one of the great things about IC
Radio is our variety of specialist
music shows. Here are the details of
our current regular shows:

You might well wonder what sort
of people become IC Radio
presenters. Egomaniacs? Weirdos?
Hi-tech Wizards? We certainly have
some of these types, but many of us
are actually ordinary students with
no delusions of grandure, no knob-
twiddling compulsion, merely a
good ear for music. If you want to
try something different but can't
picture yourself as a DJ, then think
again! Come along and meet some
of our number in our studio next to
the Southside shop. Most of our
presenters go on the air after only 3
hours training. Most importantly, if
you favour a style of music not
currently played by IC Radio then
come on down.
We would warmly welcome
anyone who'd like to help us with
our news department, our technical
construction maintenance, or our
record company liaison, our
forthcoming listener survey.Just call
on us this Wednesday (5th) at 6.30,
or at anytime we're on the air.
Freedom Fight
In Britain we have the valuable, if
precarious, freedom to say almost
whatever we like about anyone,
even about those in power;
elsewhere thousands of people are
imprisoned purely for their
opinions.
The Amnesty International group
enables students who are aware how
precious and vulnerable this
freedom is, and who feel morally
obliged by their privilege to exercise
it on behalf of others from whom it
and all other freedoms have been
taken away. The only weapon which
the group uses to combat
repression, torture or murder is the
weight of public opinion, expressed
in well-informed and courteous
letters to those who practise these
abuses. At present two cases are in
hand: one concerning a prisoner
already found to satisfy the
international organisation's
conditions of non-violence and
political balance (a condition
imposed on the relative numbers of
prisoners selected from different
regions) and consequently
'adopted', and a second still under
investigation.
Other activities of the group
include the 'urgent action' scheme
(letters or telegrams for prisoners in
imminent danger); fund-raising and
publicity.
In connection with the twenty-
fifth anniversary of Amnesty
International which occurs this
year, the group has taken part in the
national door-to-door collection
and is contributing to special
campaigns in Yugoslavia, Chile and
South Africa.
The group meets every Tuesday
at 5.30 in the Brown Committee
Room on the third floor of the
Union Building.
Firkin Run
Last Monday 17 people drove
around London on the infamous
Firkin run to raise money for the
Ferret and Firkin Pub to give a
children's school a firework display
on November 5th. When all the
monies have been collected,
Imperial College. Charity Rag will
be able to present approximately
£850 to the pub and a bill for the
asprins. It was a great collaborated
effort on everyone's part, and Man
Tai would like to thank Nigel,
Donna-Marie, Simon, Andy, Bruce,
Mike, James J, James S, Daniel,
Mark, Helen, Rodger, Brendan,
Ian, Yishu, and Emma the navigator
for all their efforts that evening and
for putting up with his driving.
Anyone owing money to these
people are asked to submit it as
quickly as possible.
Just a quick note. Rag week is
approaching quickly, so watch outfor
the posters!
Pig's Ear
Real Ale Society has held two
meetings and one beer festival this
term.
The first meeting was a
resounding success; the beer ran out
early due to such enthusiasm. The
second meeting was spoilt slightly
because the Gales BBB had not been
fined at the brewery and was
undrinkable. For further meetings
we hope to have more beer than we
have in the past few years.
On Friday 17th, members of the
society visited the "Pig's Ear" Beer
Festival at Bethnal Green. We were
able to try many real ales, mainly
from the South and Wales, all in
excellent condition. Everybody
made it back to South Ken
(eventually).
Next meeting 6th November
