Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday October 24th 1986
South Africa and Peace
UGM'S AND UNION POLICY
At Tuesday's U G M , the 'Barclays
Bank' motion will surface once
more. Many people complain that
"external" issues like boycotting
institutions with South African
interests, or, for instance,
supporting the Peace Movement,
are irrelevant to the student body
and should be left out of UGM'S. I
disagree, for several reasons. If an
issue is important to an individual
Union Member, then they have the
right to bring it to a general meeting
to ask for the support of other
students. If support is given, then
the considerable resources of the
Union can be called upon to assist in
campaigning or educating on that
issue. Contrary to popular belief,
being a student of Imperial College
does not exclude you from the
Human Race so why should "wider
issues" cease to affect you? Voicing
a collective opinion does not
immediately make the Union a
Party Political Organisation; but a
collective voice can carry a lot more
weight than an individual one. It is a
shame if the Union's "apolitical"
stance makes us afraid to talk about
anything other than beer "prices and
standing orders and beware—
narrow minded scientists/engineers
are going out of fashion.
On a practical point; as President
of a Union like this I am often called
upon to make a decision or state an
opinion on an issue of "wider"
importance. If the Union has no
policy on the issue—more than
likely under the circumstances—
then I have no option but to act on
my conscience. You may not agree
with me; but having been voted in, I
shall continue to do so until policy
tells me otherwise. That's
democracy....
LESBIANS AND GAY MEN
"Imperial would still appear to be
hearing a pile of shit as far as lesbian
and gay liberation goes...".
I quote from Stuart Beeston's
report to the General Council of the
University of London Union (Stuart
is a member of the ULC executive
and a sabbatical at University
College). To a large extent I would
agree with him . Imperial has no gay
society and anyone hoping to form
one might expect considerable
resistance, even harassment.
The attitude towards lesbians and
gay men in most Student Unions is
supportive and relaxed; This makes
life a whole lot easier for gay
students, many of whom have found
'coming out' at home impossible.
Unfortunately this can't be said of
Imperial College where 'homo-
sexual' is too often seen as an insult,
a dirty word.
There isn't a magic solution, a
way of changing the atmosphere
overnight; but something can be
done. Stuart Beeston will be coming
to the Union sometime during the
next fortnight—if anyone, gay,
straight, or somewhere in between,
would like to talk him about "gay
liberation" or forming a gay society,
come and see me and I'll fix up a
date for him to come over.
HUNT THE SABBATICAL
I gather people have been
complaining that the sabbaticals are
'never there' in the office when they
come to see us. Well unfortunately
we do have up to a dozen college
committees to go to each week, plus
all kinds of informal meetings and
visits. The best thing to do, if you
want to see one of us specifically, is
to ring 3500firstto make sure we are
there. Hopefully things will calm
down a bit towards the end of
November.
ANTI—POVERTY ACTION
You've probably read about this
elsewhere—a 1
% self-tax scheme (£6
per term) paid by standing order to
Third World First, an organisation
which raises awareness of the
reasons behind Third World
poverty whilst at the same time
funding "grass roots" aid projects.
If you want to join, or learn more
about, the scheme, forms and
leaflets are available in the Union
Office (or ask me and I'll talk for
hours!)
Well that's more than enough
from me. Have fun, especially if
you're going to the Halloween party
in the Union lounge tonight.

Colley Wobbles
Back again with yet another warble.
This is just a final warning to those
of you who have been allocated
parking permits, but haven't
collected them: Do so by Wednesday
5th November, otherwise they will be
given away. Also on the parking
permit front, will all those in the
Southside parking area please
return their permits to me, so I can
exchange them for the correct discs.
Ta!
As there is a U G M looming on
the horizon, it is once again time for
the Exec, and hopefully all their
unions as well as members, to begin
worrying about attendances. There
is one thing at the forefront of the
Quorum question that really pee's
me off and that is, all of you who are
members of a club or society rely
upon the Union in one way or
another. However hardly any of you
deem it necessary to come along to
the Union's decision making body.
This attitude, should in my opinion
any way, be rewarded with a lack of
attention imposed on the
club/society by the Union i.e. no
money allocated. So the overall gist
is that if you as club members or
society members can't be bothered
to support the hand that feeds you,
why should it feed you? Come on
boys and girls, how about a bit more
responsibility and attend of your
own accord, as us passing motions
means nothing really.
Now we move onto motions, this
week we have appearing a motion
on Barclays Bank, and no others of
the moment. However if you
approach the U G M Chairman
Hugh Southey with a motion, he has
the power to deem it an emergency
motion. (All motions must be in by a
week in advance of the U.G.M.
unless decreed emergency). Any
assistance required in formulating
your motion can be obtained from
Hugh or me. And remember you
don't have to have been here a long
time, or be part of a group to put
forward a motion.
