Football; IC 1sts 1, Kent University 1
Point Dropped
IC's first point dropped this season
was, in the context of the occasion
and the quality of the opposition, a
point gained rather than lost. Not
only that, it was the first point ever
gained by any IC team against Kent
University in the U A U Tournam-
ent. Kent inflicted IC 1st IX's
biggest defeat of last season, by 6-0,
and this almost completely new IC
team was determined not to let Kent
dominate the game with their
overall strength and size, as they had
last year.
Kent started well, but as soon as
the ball reached the defensive area,
Kent were stopped by a solid IC
tackle. IC slowly began to find their
way, and 20 minutes into the game,
Nigel Collier popped up to put IC
into the lead. IC's defence made sure
that the score remained 1-0 at half
time to the home team.
Kent started the second half in
determined mood, and laid siege on
the IC goal, IC should have killed
the game on the break, but
Alessandro Lunghi and then Dave
Lynne both missed presentable
chances. The referee's decision not
to penalise offsides .provided an
exciting ending to the game. With
10 minutes to go, a Kent forward
broke, clearly offside, and finished
well. IC defence did well to keep the
final Kent onslaught at bay but,
with 2 minutes to go, complete
tragedy struck as a goalmouth
scramble was ended when Laurence
Covill fell to the ground with a
suspected broken leg. This could
prove costly in the games to come
for IC, and I wish "Lol" a speedy
recovery.
Team: A Allen, M. Bradley, P. Ewart,
P. Dyson, L Covill, B. Wood, B.
Mason, P. Olden, A. Lunghi (Capt.),

Emphatic Victory
Following up on an impressive 3-3
draw against IC seconds the
previous weekend, the thirds
recorded an emphatic victory over
lacklustre opposition last Saturday
at Harlington. Well taken goals by
Mark Woodgate and Chris Gordon
fomed a base on which Paul Savage
was to provide the icing as on the
cake with a spectacular diving
header shortly before the end. As
usual for the thirds the emphasis
was on sound teamwork rather than
individual brilliance. With
performances like this based on
solid defence, dynamic midfield and
slightly more clinical finishing.the
team has much to look forward to
this season.

The 1st XI continued their fine form
this season with two wins and a
draw this week. The first game
against Kent in the UAU, Imperial
dropped their first point in 4 games.
Bad umpiring and a wet pitch led to
scrappy, bad-tempered game. Kent
opened the scoring but the equaliser
was well picked up by Paul
Skipworth. Thursday saw Brunei in
the Middlesex cup. The tuned
opposition couldn't cope with the
likes of Paul Coleman's short
corners. Saturday was the start of
the Middlesex league and a visit to
B . P . On the whole good
performances this week.
Dry Slalom
The IC Ski Club competed in the
Kings Ski Club Dry Slope Slalom
racing on October 18th. Even
though it was the first race of the
year, the league has become more
competitive while being more
friendly than last year. With a few
lucky races, the IC 1st team won the
second place position out of about
14 teams. The team comprised of
Kate Finch, Ivor Gitlbe, Keith
Adeney, Mike Johnston and Mark
Schmidt. All performed well on the
fast wet difficult course. The Ski
Club's next race is November 30 for
which we will need lots of help,
especially ladies with racing or good
skiing abilities. A lot is taking place,
so please come along to sign up. Just
askfor Clare, Mike or, Mark
Schmidt. Hope to see you skiing.
Foot Trophy
Competitors from as far away as
Greece and U.S.A. made the Foot
trophy a truly international event.
The 72 boats were split into two
leagues with the top two teams from
each going through to the next
round. The IC team started well -
but even Brimelow's tactical
excellence couldn't make up for the
team's lack of boat speed and they
were narrowly beaten by a more
experienced team. This was typical
of the weekend; although the team
started well they lacked the final
punch needed for success at this
level. Nevertheless they finished
11th and all three IC boats qualified
for the Gnurns Trophy. This was the
first big event of our season and the
team showed they have the potential
to succeed in the future,
Team: Apostolous Leonidoph-
olous, Malcolm Hunter, Samantha
Page, Gareth David, Andrea
Burrows, Richard Brimelow, Adam
Stork, Jenny Ramsey.

With several absentees, the teams
gave a solid performance in the first
league match of the five match
series.
Helen Bolt gave a strong warning
to the London ladies of her
aspirations to the top this year, and
selection for the UL Japan team this
year, finishing just over a minute
behind the leader.
In the mens's race the
Waterson/Gamblin confrontation
again proved to be a tightly fought
needle match with Gavin leading
from the outset only to be burnt off
by Bryan in the very closing stages.
Next match: Trent Park, 5th

Men Win
Our Mens 3rd Team started off
badly by losing a match to the 1st
pair from Guy's. This 1st pair also
managed to beat our 2nd and 3rd
pairs but not without a strong fight
from our 2nd pair.However, we did
manage to beat the other 2 pairs
without any trouble at all.

Men Lose
After an easy 9:0 victory over LSE
this week, IC found Kent University
much suffer opposition. However, it
has to be said that kent had a very
good first pair, boasting a county
player, but otherwise they were an
average side.
