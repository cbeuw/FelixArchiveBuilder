Rat Routes
Deep in the recesses of the
Government Research Centre for
Nasty Cruel Experiments on Poor
Little Helpless Creatures, Chris the
rat, a product of third generation
head growth research, was hearing
about the ordeal he was about to go
through, from his cage-mate, Brian.
'They put you on this 8x8 grid
with a piece of cheese,' he said,
drawing the following in the dust:
route from him to the cheese that
minimises the number of bends and
goes through every square.The £5
prize will go to the entrant with the
fewest turns, even if it's not the
correct answer, so it's worth
entering whatever answer you get!!
Solutions, comments, etc to the
F E L I X office by 1.00pm
Wednesday, please.

'with all these wires attached to
your vitals. It took me a while to
suss out what was going on, but it
turns out that you don't get the
cheese unless you've visited every
other square on the grid first.'
'Sounds easy enough,' said Chris.
'Ah! But every time you deviate
from a straight line you get an
electric shock, and you're only
allowed to move from square to
square horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.'
'So how can you avoid being
shocked?' Asked Chris.
'Well you can't. But there is a way
of minimising the number of shocks
you get.'
'What's that?'
'I'll only tell you,' said Brian.'in
exchange for two of the Rat-Snacks
which you keep hidden under that
pile of fluff in the corner!'
'You rat!' said Chris.
This week's problem is to save
Chris's Rat-Snacks by finding the
Last Week
We only had one solution to the
crossword, from Paul Harvey, Mech
Eng 3, who we felt deserved the prize
even though he got 1-down wrong
(it was one of the easier clues!)
Please pick up your £5 after 1.00pm
Monday.

I've just spent two hours trailing
around The Industrial Society
Careers Fair, and quite frankly most
of the careers on offer left me cold. I
can't beleive what sort of people
could be so short sighted as to
become actuaries, chartered
accountants or management
consultants. So there may not be a
lot in your Barclays highter rate
deposit account right now, and the
Arthur Andersen and Co. starting
salary is undeniably attractive, but
really it would appear to me to be
selling your soul way beyond the call
of duty.
Anyway having decided that I
didn't want to work for British
Nuclear Fuels, or any of the
numerous G E c inpanies, I
decided to find something else to do
with my time. And where better to
start than the classified ads. in City
Limits
There are the usual collection of
jobs, with London boroughs and
Womyns print units, but there are
also one or two of interest to
students. Record and Tape
Exchange in Notting Hill, and
elsewhere in London, are looking
for 'music loving students' for part
time work in their shops; the phone
number is in the book. Also Film
extras are required for a new movie;
call 044282 7224 now.
On the subject of movies, there
are some good new releases about at
the moment. 'The Decline of
Western Civilisation' (now there's
an idea...) at the ICA is billed as the
'Woodstock' of the late '70's Los
Angeles punk scene. 'About Last
Night' is still on release all over the
West End; a friend of mine saw this
and liked it. 'Betty Blue', the
FACE'S film of the year, is still on at
the Notting Hill Gate cinema,
amongst others, and if you haven't
seen this yet, go and see it now.
Other favourites of mine at the
moment are Alex Cox's 'Sid and
Nancy', Neil Jordan's 'Mona Lisa',
and James Ivory's ' A Room With a
View', all of which are on in London
this week.
Ben Elton is without doubt one of
the most popular comics about. He
appears at the Bloomsbury Theatre
on Saturday in aid of KIDS, a
charity in Camden set up to help
families with children with special
needs. Ben Elton will be joined by
Denise Black and the Kray Sisters,
Gary Howard and John Hegley.
Book now. Also on in the West End
is 'Breaking the Code' at the
Haymarket. This is the true life
story of Alan Turing, the pioneering
mathematician who developed the
first prototype computer. See the
review in this issue, and then see the
Play-
Peter Hammill, singer with Van
Der Graff (who?—Ed), is playing
three nights at the Bloomsbury
Theatre from the 6th to the 8th
November. Singers as diverse as
John Lydon and Jim Kerr have
quoted him as an influence, but
none the less, his twenty year career
and thirty albums have gone
virtually unnoticed. However
despite a virtual boycott by the
music press, his shows are very
entertaining. Why not try
something new.
