News FELIX, Friday October 31st 1986 3
Nothing to
Declare
The cycle path on the Fulham
Road is to be removed by the Royal
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea
at a cost of £5,000. The Council's
Traffic Section told FELIX that the
road which is used by many IC
cyclists, is too narrow to
accomodate all the lanes needed and
that the cyclists hamper other
traffic. This claim was completely
dismissed by Friends of the Earth
and the London Cycling Campaign,
who said that a report by the
Council's own officers had
recommended retention of the path
after the end of the experimental
period. Both groups suggested that
the decision was due to Nicholas
Freeman, leader of the Council,
having a dislike of cyclists.
Union President Christine Taig
said "of course they should bloody
leave the cycle path there, and they
should put them everywhere else as
well."
Psycho
Path
Electronic locks in Southside are
due to be put in to operation in two
weeks time. Their introduction
forms part of a package designed by
Geoff Reeves, Chief of Security, to
prevent mysterious intruder's
gaining access to the halls. Each
resident has been issued with a
magnetic card to allow entrance to
the East and West doors. Security
plans to change the magnetic code
on the cards every two to three
years.
At the same time as introducing
the new locks, security will staff the
eastern lodge near the RCS office
and the central lodge. The door next
to the refectory has been fitted with
a new lock and can be opened by
residents only, after six o'clock. Mr
Reeves said that he was considering
staffing the western lodge, but
wanted the new arrangements to be
fully operational before doing so.
Sherfield
Crime Wave
On Wednesday the 10.30 am third
year computer science lecture
passed without event. The lecture,
part of a course in Declarative
Programming, given by Professor
John Darlington, a leading
researcher in the field of parallel
computing, was attended by almost
all of the students taking the option.
A spokesperson for the third year
students in the Department of
Computing said he was very happy
with the way the lecture went, and
its smooth running was typical of
Professor Darlington's approach.
Professor Darlington obviously
took the whole thing in his stride,
and told FELIX that the lecture,
which is compulsory for students
taking the four year Software
Engineering course, was as he
expected and that he "could not see
what all the fuss is about". Students
in the Department of Computing
are looking forward to Monday's
4.30 pm. Declarative Programing
Tutorial.
Electronic
Locks In
Southside
A cheque book and cheque cards
were stolen from room 422 of the
Sherfield Building last Friday. Also
taken were some personal effects
including a diary and address book.
The theft was discovered at about 7
pm.
Earlier in the evening, an intruder
was seen in the building. He was
described as about 6 feet tall,
coloured and with a gold tooth.
Sherfield Security searched the
building, but were unable to find the
man. Police have requested that
students and staff should not
approach this man, who is believed
to be dangerous.
Mr. Tyc has appealed for the
return of his personal belongings,
either to room 422 or to FELIX.
On Monday evening Michael
Bentine gave his annual lecture for
Wellsoc about the paranormal.
Despite a late start due to traffic
jams delaying Mr. Bentine, the talk
went well with the audience
obviously enjoying his anecdotes of
past experiences both paranormal
and normal. Mr. Bentine stressed
the importance of objectivity and
open-mindedness in investigating
paranoral phenomena, but also
emphasised the need for
imagination in science.
Mr. Bentine has recently agreed
to become the President of Wellsoc.
