Feature FELIX, Friday October 31st 1986 4
Part Two of "The 17 per cent Solution"
Welcome Workshop
I feel lucky to be surrounded by so
many talented, lively people. As
Rector's wife, one has a rare
opportunity to Invent-A-Job.
I lie. There was an inherited post:
heading up the Women's Club. It is
one of the few vertical structures in
the College, embracing academic
and a d m i n i s t r a t i v e staff,
postgraduate students, all wives and
undergraduate associates. Still an
infant, it was formed last year from
the former Wives' Club and seeks
members committed to the idea that
more people need to talk to each
other. Our next event is a "Welcome
W o r k s h o p " on Wednesday
November 12th from 11.00am to
3.30pm at 170 Queensgate.
Designed for new arrivals—staff,
postgraduates and wives—a
morning session will cover making
the most out of living in London,
how to get involved quickly in local
life, finding a suitable roof, dentist,
school After lunch, workshops
led by postgraduates will swap ideas
on ways to live on a shoestring—but
vibrantly. Our aim is that everyone
will do a lot of talking in small
groups and go away with at least one
phone number of a potential friend.
We hope to encourage people to do
further research so that we may
break into print to produce our own
Tried and Tested Guide to Life in
South Kensington before next year.
The committee is providing a lot of
home cooking for the lunch, so if
you're new, do come.
Our next big event will be a
children's fair, with games devised
by IC wizards to use science in the
pursuit of fun. It can only work with
all that imagination, inovation, wit
and skill that staff, students and
technicians share, so do start
scheming and dreaming up games
now.
In the summer, July 12th to be
exact, we are joining forces with the
Royal College of Art to help
celebrate a 150th anniversary. Hand
in hand with our eminent and
exciting neighbours—all the
Museums, the Royal College of
Music, Organists, the Royal Festival
Ballet, the French Institute, the
Goethe Institute, the Royal
Geographical Society and the
Albert Hall, we shall host a fabulous
party. Did anyone every say IC was
a dull monotech?
The Women's Club is also
interested in improving the
communal areas in student houses,
in supporting the nursery and in
creating a club centre somewhere in
college where people can drop in to
offer ideas, help, problems and be
sure of a coffee and no VDU's.
Come join us. We need you.
Thus endeth the commercial. As I
said, my own role has yet to be
invented. It starts by listening, then
bubbling away on the back burner.
Some elements in the Brew may be:
encouraging all endeavours in the
arts, making 170 a centre for an
extended IC and "Albertland"
family, making industrial employers
more aware of student expectations,
setting up with the Careers Office
video mock interview practice
sessions with feedback from invited
employers, attracting more women
to IC to improve the quality of life
for everyone. On really energetic
days I'd like to help raise the money
for a purpose-built nursery and for a
faculty club that would be a place
for staff, alumni and postgraduates
to use as a clubhouse and invite
guests from industry, the City and
the Government. The brilliance and
the talent at IC is indisputable; yet a
stir or two might not be amiss.

Women's
Consciousness
WIST (WOMEN IN SCIENCE
A N D TECHNOLOGY) is a society
run by women students for women
students. We are primarily a social
group, although we are and always
have been ardent campaigners for
women's rights. You may have
heard a lot about us already—some
of it true, a lot of it not. We like to
think of ourselves as a group that
can encourage women's conscious-
ness among all students. We can
offer mutual support and a refuge
from our male dominated
enviroment. So come along to the
common room with a difference—
The Senior Common Room (above
the Snack Bar) every Tuesday at
12.30, and meet with us to make use
of the friendship and support that
we can offer each other.
JANE BOWIE
PRESIDENT WIST
Williams and WIST
Mrs Shirley Williams, the President
of the SDP, addressed a meeting of
Women in Science and Technology
(WIST) on Tuesday. The main
theme of her talk was the changing
role of women in society, and in
particular the role that she saw for
women in scientific subjects. Mrs
Williams felt that it was up to
women to raise questions about the
impact of science upon society. She
cited examples of 'prestige' projects
in Third World countries where, for
example, huge hydro-electric
schemes are created, with a
consequent loss and erosion of land
needed to produce food, and
warned that "We cannot afford
scientifically illiterate students of
humanities and humanistically
illiterate students of science".
On the subject of women as
leaders, Mrs Williams noted that
successful women leaders have had
many of the same qualities as men in
the same positions—toughness,
ruthlessness, logic and aggression—
and proclaimed that "women can be
just as good as men are." Although
she admitted that women in power
often had masculine qualities, Mrs
Williams suggested that a gentler,
feminine approach to problems
would produce better results in the
long term and gave as an example
the manner in which Germany was
treated after the Second World War,
contrasting it, with the treatment
after the First, and the subsequent
rise of Hitler. Still on the subject of
women in positions of power, Mrs
Williams did not feel that
segregation, for example by the
creation of a Women's Minister,
would help. Rather, this would lead
to patronisation and help to keep
women out of key positions. It
would, she suggested, be far better
to enforce equality by a system of
monitoring to ensure fair practice,
or the imposition of Contract
Compliance, whereby a company
cannot win a contract unless it
proves that it treats everyone
equally.
Asked by FELIX if she thought
that the lack of women in science
and technology was due to the
standard of teaching and the
shortage of science teachers, she
replied that teachers were
ludicrously badly paid, and that a
10% pay increase in real terms,
together with conversion courses,
was needed to attract people back in
to teaching. Though she felt that co-
education was in principle a good
thing, Mrs Williams expressed the
view that it also reduced the number
of women taking science subjects, as
they were encouraged towards the
more 'traditional' areas. She also
felt that the creation of the new
Technical Colleges would empty the
schools of scientists and make the
problem worse.
FELIX asked Mrs Williams for
her o p i n i o n of the new
Unemployment Benefit question-
naire, which may disqualify those,
such as students, who are unable to
travel to find work. She asserted
that this was "An attempt to reduce
the number of unemployed before
the next election" and said that the
SDP would provide a 'basic benefit'
for students studying after the age of
16, with removal of fees for part
time students.
Questioned about the possibility
of student loans, Mrs Williams
stated that the SDP believed them to
be necessary only in the case where
the parental contribution is not
made, and that they would have to
be provided at low interest rates.
The SDP has, she said, no plans to
replace grants by loans, and would
like to remove the need for a
parental contribution, though she
admitted that this could not be done
very quickly. The first priority of
Mrs Williams' party is to increase all
higher education by 50%, giving
equal emphasis to both humanities
and science, rather than boosting
science at the expense of humanities.
