25 Years of the Battle for
Human Rights
Twenty five years ago a British
lawyer, Peter Benenson,
encountered the case of two
students in Portugal who had
been imprisoned for drinking a
toast to freedom. His first
reaction was to protest
indignantly to the Portuguese
Embassy, however he realised
that his efforts alone would be
lost. During the 50's Benenson
had witnessed a number of
political trials as an observer and
also as a defence counsel, and
was familiar with the problems.
Peter Benenson's genius was in
realising the power of public
opinion and organised
campaigning. He wrote an article
in The Observer called "The
Forgotten Prisoners" in which he
drew attention to the large
number of people around the
world imprisoned for their
beliefs. The article also launched
a campaign called "Appeal for
Amnesty 1961" whose object was
to obtain an Amnesty for all
Political and Religous prisoners
held for their views alone -
prisoners of conscience. Part of
the campaign was the founding
of an office in London to gather
information about such prisoners
and to publicise individual cases.
The appeal attracted
considerable support from
around the world and from it
grew the organisation Amnesty
International. The founders
demonstrated considerable
foresight in laying down
guidelines for the development
of Amnesty. They realised that it
had to avoid becoming a political
tool of any one country or party
for its campaigns to maintain
their influence. Hence all funding
comes entirely from subscriptions
and donations and Amnesty
remains very much a volunteer
organisation. A n International
Council scrupulously controls
policy decisions and lays down
guidelines for funding. In
addition Amnesty enjoys special
status with the United Nations
and many other multi-nation
bodies.
Since its inception Amnesty
International has stuck very
closely to its original aims and
this policy has taken it to the
forefront of the Human Rights
movement. The testaments of
many released prisoners are a
measure of the concern its letter
writing campaigns can generate
in even the most despotic
governments. Its mandate is
based on the civil and political
rights set down in the United
Nations Declaration of Human
Rights of 1948 and on the U N
'Declaration of Protection of all
Persons from Torture and other
Cruel Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment' of
1975. It seeks:
The release of people detained
anywhere, regardless of race,
colour, wealth, politics or
religion, on the basis of their
beliefs, provided they have
not used violence.
Fair and prompt trials for
all political prisoners.
The abolition of torture and
degrading treatment of any
prisoners, including abolition
of the death penalty.
Amnesty does not oppose or
support any government, nor
does it confine its attention to
governments alone as there are
many private and opposition
groups who use inhuman
methods. Amnesty is concerned,
now and in the future, with
people as people.
Human Rights - A
Challenge
It is very difficult to find things
to care about. Every day we are
presented in the media with
images, factual and fictional,
which are tailored to titillate our
emotions. Sex, scandal and death
make 'good' news and 'good'
soap. There are also a large
number of good causes around
competing for our charity -
competing also with the daily
barrage of advertising exhorting
us to spend out on ourselves. So
why should you give a damn
about Human Rights Week, its
all just the "trendy lefties" again
isn't it? - Wrong.
Human Rights are not a
political issue. Quite simply if
you are not repulsed by some of
the treatment dealt to innocent
and defenceless people, because
they are not conforming to the
wishes of the powers that be,
SIMMS'
i i m i i i i ( | i " " " " U
Castlereagh interrogation
centre in Belfast, one of
the subjects of an
Amnesty Report on torture
in 1971 and a reminder
that rights abuses can
creep close to home
then you are sick. Human Rights
Week is an attempt to publicise
the true nature of the abuse of
human beings for the sake of
power in a disturbingly large part
of the world today.
The organisation Amnesty
International has a special place
in the defence of basic Human
Rights. It is uniquely
independent. When I first
encountered Amnesty I was
struck both by the indisputable
justice of its cause and by the
commitment shown by its
workers. In fact for a largely
voluntary organisation it
demonstrates a remarkable
degree of effeciency and
professionalism. Here I believe is
something I can care about.
Human Rights Week is not a
purely Amnesty event. I must
emphasise that there will be
participation from groups
concerned about rights abuse as
part of their own fields of
interest, and that they are not
necessarily part of any Amnesty
campaign. However as this year
marks the 25th anniversary of the
original Amnesty appeal it seems
fitting to highlight the work of
Amnesty International.
There are another set of
reasons behind this supplement.
As with most things at Imperial
this event is being organised by a
small group of people who have
managed to drum up the energy
to care about something. I find it
distressing, in an institution full
of supposedly highly intelligent
people, that the number of
students who are really bothered
by moral issues is very small.
There is of course IC Rag, but let
us examine the motivation behind
this worthy cause a little closer.
Rag is a release from the stress of
work, an excuse to act like a
looney and have fun in a good
cause. Sure keeping the totals
climbing is a great idea but for
most people that is a status
The effectiveness ot
Amnesty letter
writing campaigns
has demonstrated
the power of mass
opinion
symbol to show how good they
are at 'raking it in'. Money is not
enough to solve the world's
problems, each and every one of
us has to care about the
important issues facing humanity.
The effectiveness of Amnesty
letter writing campaigns has
demonstrated the power of mass
opinion. You must show that you
care or accept accusations of
apathy, ignorance or
complacency. All that is asked
for is an intelligent attitude to
public debate and perhaps the
writing of a letter. If there is any
student here who cannot attempt
any of those I pity them.
Thanks are due to: The Rector,
Prof Ash for sparing his time so
graciously; Amnesty International
for material and assistance;
Simon Bosher for organising the
timetable of events; Event
organisers; Dave Jones for
allowing production of this
supplement; The contributors for
their work; and you in the
anticipation that you will read
this...
