"But how are we going to get people
to come and see a play about
Nuclear Power?" asks Em (Maggie
Ford). "We'll give it a silly name!"
answers Dee (Cordelion Ditton).
Hence The Day The Sheep Turned
Pink" Drill Hall Arts Centre), a
brave attempt at dealing with a very
controversial subject with humour,
humanity and common sense.
Two reporters, Em and Dee, are
trying to find out the truth about
nuclear power by decoding all the
jargon and talking to the people that
the new power stations affect. They
in turn are going to write a play from
the material that they have
researched and so we are given the
play-within-a-play format again,
but here it is an excellent way of
incorporating serious debate with
full-blown comedy sketches.
The majority of the arguments
centre around the Dounreay station
in Scotland where the writer,
Cordelios Ditton, did much of her
research. Every angle is covered;
from the local villagers' complaint
that they cannot challenge the safety
of the station because they are
continually beaten back by scientific
language and technological
language that they do not
understand and so cannot argue
Shadow Syndicate production
"Between the Devil and the Deep
Blue Sea" was one of the most
successful productions at this year's
Edinburgh Festival. It can now be
seen at the Gate Theatre, Notting
Hill until November 15th and is well
worth seeking out as it is a hugely
enjoyable combination of action,
drama and jazz to send the feet
tapping and eyes watering at the
same time.
The Shadow Syndicates
productions are always full of
original theatrical tricks and effects,
my favourite is the gun shot in slow
motion! "Between the Devil and the
Deep Blue Sea" is a great
production by very talented
company and as Notting Hill is not
very far away there are no excuses
for not going to see it!
against, to the straightforward
economic reasons for using Nuclear
Power stations rather then coal
powered ones.
There is a scene of immense
power when a mother, who lives
near Dounreay, describes simply the
death of her son from leukaemia,
and how the disease might have
been caused by the radioactivity in
the area. However it is not an anti-
nuclear play, the end message seems
to be that the arguments are far too
complex for anybody to be simply
'for' or 'against'. At times the debate
is a little too drawn out but there are
some wickedly original sketches
involving radioactive limpets and
pink sheep etc to break it up.
It is a play that is not just meant
for entertainment, it is intelligent
and thought provoking, which is
more than can be said for most of
the current West End productions.
Even _if you do not want to see a
show there, the Drill Hall Arts
Centre at 16 Cheniers St., (close to
ULU) is well worth seeking out as it
has a cosy bar and an excellent,
reasonably priced, restaurant
underneath.which is open until late.

At last. A play with some relevance
to the cloistered world of science.
Hugh Whitemore's 'Breaking the
Code' relates the life story of Alan
Turing : mathematical genius;
Enigma code breaker and pioneer in
artificial intelligence. For all these
achievements the Turing story is not
a happy one. His non conformity
(he was a homosexual) led
ultimately to confrontation with the
authorities of austere 50's Britain
and suicide—a sad fate for such a
brilliant and clear thinking man. His
life can be read in "Alan Turing:
The Enigma" by Hodges, the book
in which this play is based.
Back to the play. The story is
unfolded in clever yet elaborate
'flashback and flashforward' style,
concentrating on three parts of
Turing's life—childhood, the
Enigma years, the later scandals.
The fundamental conflict, that of
genius and man, is quickly revealed
to be the main theme and the
flashback device makes sure the
sense of impending tragedy never
leaves. It is probable this complex
narrative method is the only one
that can avoid the dryness of
'biography'.
Amongst all this the important
stuff of the play, the Turing
character, is pieced together. The
treatment is sympathetic and careful
if erring on the side of simplification
(for the audience's sake probably)
and the relationships between
Turing and the other characters are
well-established and interesting.
The lead role is taken by Derek
Jacobi who gives a typically
accomplished performance, equally
convincing as the tortured man and
the mathematician avidly
explaining Russell's paradox. (The I
Claudius stammer returns also as
the Alan Turing stammer).
Isobel Dean plays Turing's
mother, at times verging on the
'actressy' in emotional passages but
otherwise engaging as Turing's
contact with prosaic reality. Michael
Gough and Joanna David as
Enigma colleagues are both good,
although it is really Jacobi's play.
As might be expected from the
names involved, this production has
the quality to succeed although it is
not the greatest theatre to be seen at
present. To me it remains the oddity
I fancied it might be when I first read
of it. Hopefully, however, it will be
seen and talked about and stimulate
some thought for misunderstood
intellectuals like Turing. We have
seen in the past how the implicit
glamour of theatre and cinema has
the power to do this.

Muchos Desporados Kentish Town is
a riotously amusing look at the
contrast between the dope smoking
poverty of Kentish Town and the
cocaine sniffing snobbishness of the
nicer parts of Willesden Green.
Collins, Sylvester and Rosco are
the three 'black' brothers stuck in
Thatcher's rutt. No job and no
money...the only alternative can be
to get stoned; until that is, the idea of
doing a job on the coke pushers in
Willesden formulates. All three
characters are well played.
The scene shifts to upper-class
Yuppyland to find an intense,
paranoid coke dealer and his dumb
Sloane girlfriend delivering the
'charlie'. The 'brothers' invasion,
accompanied by dark glasses and
baseball bats, interferes with the
business being undertaken.
However, after a few heated
moments followed by nearby sirens,
they leave with the loot, but not
before 'a few lines for the road...'.
Muchos Desporados Kentish Town is
just over one hour of witty, fast,
non-farcical entertainment. If you
don't catch it tomorrow night,
watch out for its transfer.
