Star Warrior
Threatened Drinking
Clubs
Five hundred scientists in British
Universities have signed a pledge
condemning the American Strategic
Defence Initiative Programme,
more commonly known as Star
Wars. The pledge, part, of campaign
to boycott Star Wars has been
organised by Dr. Anne Davis,
formally of Imperial, and Robert
Brandenberger of the Department
of Applied Mathematics and
Theoretical Physics in Cambridge.
To date academics from the
Physics departments of twenty four
British Universities have lent their
support to the campaign.
The Pledge is being coordinated
at Imperial by Dr. David Caplin, a
member of Scientists Against
Nuclear Arms (SANA). It has been
signed by 60% of the Physics
department including Depart-
mental Head, Professor Tom
Kibble, and Nobel Prize winner
Professor Salam.
Dr. Caplin explained that the Star
Wars Research Boycott was an
attempt to ensure the British
Government and public realise that
SDI is unfeasible. "We are giving
support to our American collegues,
6000 of whom have signed our SDI
petitions"he said.
Dr Keith Burnett spoke on a BBC
radio programme on Sunday about
his opinions on undertaking SDI
research. In 'The World this
Weekend', the decision of over 500
academics to sign a pledge not to
carry out such research was
discussed, with Dr Burnett putting
forward the view that working on it
would give the SDI project a
credibility it does not deserve. "I
cannot take money from a
programme which I think is
nonsense", he said. He stressed that
it was a difficult decision, and that
the boycott was not supported only
by pacifists and unilateralists.
Goodbye Paul
Paul Jowitt, Warden of
Falmouth Keogh Hall, is to leave IC
for Scotland at the end of this year.
He is taking a new position as
Professor of Civil Engineering
Systems at Herriot-Watt University.
Dr. Jowitt, who described his time
at Imperial as "enjoyable but hard
work", said that he hoped that FK
residents would "have a good time,
work hard and play hard" in his
absence.
Two emergency motions have been
submitted for Tuesday's IC U G M .
The first, proposed by Jane Spiegel,
would ban C C U drinking clubs
from using College facilities, on the
grounds that the k ' 'h* —t outdated
and sexist. Since they were formed
50 years ago, 'The 22 club', 'Links',
and 'Chaps' have not admitted
women,'and it is believed that the
only reason for rejection is their
gender. Ms Spiegel feels that the
actions of these clubs worsen
The Careers Fair, organised by
the Industrial Society, took place on
Tuesday and Wednesday of this
week in the Sherfield Building and
the Great Hall, where sixty
companies, offering a wide range of
careers exhibited on each day.
Rod Holdsworth, chairperson of
The Industrial Society said that he
was pleased with the response; 2000
students from several London
Colleges visited the fair each day,
and added that the companies were
impressed with the quality of the
students they saw.

students' distributed leaflets to

A highly confidential Government
report leaked to the press has
revealed that universities are even
worse off than they claim. The
report, which was jointly
commissioned by the Department
of Education and Science and the
Treasury, studied Leicester, Brunei,
Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow
and Keele as examples of the
country's universities. It predicts
that by 1990 five of the six will have
to sell off assets and reduce staff
replacements, in order to pay for
running costs.
Imperial's already poor reputation
as a place for women to study.
The second emergency motion,
which has been proposed by Simon
Boscher, is a request that the
College adopts Ivan Stawovorit as a
prisoner of conscience. M r
Stawovorit, a Jehovah's Witness,
has been sentenced to five years
imprisonment for failing to register
his congregation with Soviet
authorities.
those entering the Fair, urging
people not to take jobs in the
defence and nuclear power
industries. The response to these
leaflets was mixed; the organisers of
the campaign said the response was
good, although Christine Taig, ICU
President, condemned the leaflets as
illegal as they did not carry the name
of any ICU Society. A spokes
person for the Industrial Society
told FELIX " if people want to hand
out leaflets, it's a free country " and
added that a few of the exhibitors
were unamused by the adverse
publicity.
