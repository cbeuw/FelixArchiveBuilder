FELIX FELIX, Friday October 31st 1986 7
Imperial College's Adopted
Prisoner - Ivan Starovoit
The Group has adopted a
Ukranian, I.Y. Starovoit, who was
imprisoned for practising his
religion. He was gaoled for five
years in a 'labour colony of strict
regime', on the charge of
'Infringement of rights and
persons under the appearance of
performing religious ceremonies'.
Ivan Starovoit was gaoled because
he is a Jehovah's Witness.
Little more is known about this
case as the Soviet authorities are
not too forthcoming with
information, however the general
state of religious persecution
within the USSR is known. The
imprisonment of believers is under
a confusing variety of laws: for
not registering a congregation, or
disrupting the social order by
holding a procession, etc. The list
of religions involved ranges from
the Russian Orthodox Church to
Buddhists. The Jehovah's
Witnesses and Pentecostalists are
particularly caught in a trap as it
is effectively illegal to practise
their religion. In order to worship
together they must register their
congregation, however such
registration is never granted to
these groups and they must
therefore break the rule to
worship.
Please help us to secure the
release of Ivan Starovoit by
joining in the Group's activities.
At the very least try to write a
short polite letter to the Soviet
Department of Internal Affairs in
the Donetsk region expressing
concern about his case. Four
guidelines on writing letters to
foreign governments are,
1 Never be rude or offensive.
2 Never advance any political
views. Remeber you are writing
on humanitarian grounds.
3 Stress that your concern is only
for the prisoners basic human
rights; write as if you believe the
government is open to reason.
4 Write in simple clear English
unless you are fluent in Russian
(or whatever other language is
appropriate to a particular case).
Letters should be addressed to;
Ukrainskaya SSR
