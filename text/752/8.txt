A Personal View - by The
Rector
It is not easy to find a consensus
for what makes for a good life.
Should one look for serenity, a
life of calm contemplation? Or
should one seek happiness in
being fully stretched? Should one
contribute to the next generation?
Or delegate that activity to others?
Should one try to puzzle out
ultimate questions of our being?
Or cheerfully admit that we shall
never know?
There are no answers to such
questions—which is of course no
reason why one should not ask
them. Yet there are some
imperatives of our being which we
can declare with no introspection.
We know that torturing a child is
a terrible wrong. No one needs to
tell us. The act offends the very
essence of our being, that aspect
of our perceptions which is at the
base of our humanity. And yet it
happens; individuals are tortured,
imprisoned without charge,
sometimes for decades and
murdered. It happens, in many
parts of the world; it happens on
a large scale.
It is easy to say that those who
perpetrate the crimes must be
sick—and so no doubt they are.
But the chain of responsibility can
be long. Those who initiate the
actions are remote from the scene
of the crimes; those who carry
them out, may convince
themselves—and they may indeed
beright—thatprotest would turn
the individual or his family into
victims. Those who initiate the
actions may have no need and
indeed no desire to remember.
This is why a blazing light
illuminating the crimes can be so
remarkably effective. It forces the
perpetrators to remember. That
which can otherwise be buried in
a dark recess of the mind can no
longer be controlled. The thing
becomes known to family, friends,
acquaintances, to the public at
large, but above all to the
perpetrator himself. To focus this
light of knowledge and of
self—knowledge is the primary
role of the Human Rights
Movement.
It is a task which has been
performed with brilliant success
by Amnesty International.
Amnesty has succeeded, over a
quarter of a century in retaining
its integrity, rarely challenged even
by thoseresponsiblefor the crimes
it is exposing, rarely
challenged—never successfully.
Amnesty International has
shown how one can fight—and
win using as weapons nothing
more than information carefully
sought, and relentlessly exposed.
They deserve our fullest support
during the Human Rights
week—and beyond.

The Reality of Torture
"I felt a shock of burning heat
spread all over my body ...I cried
out in terrible pain ...my whole
body trembled because of the high
electric charge streaming through
it". Like countless other victims
under differing political systems,
he had simply been taken into
custody by government agents
without any pretence of legality.
Despite a universal ban on
torture proclaimed by the United
Nations, the practice - ordered or
condoned by governments -
persists. Allegations of the
torture and ill-treatment of
prisoners have come from more
than 90 countries since the start
of the decade: in many electric
shocks, sexual assaults, severe
beatings and mock executions
have become routine. In certain
countries doctors take part in
interrogations while the state and
courts shield the torturers.
Why Oppose Torture?
Every act of torture is a
violation of human dignity and
international law. As such it is
prohibited under the
constitutions of many nations, is
an offence under the criminal law
and contravenes key international
treaties that protect human
rights.
Apologists for torture often
argue that it is justified in the
defence of society and innocent
lives. The truth is that this
arguement does not fit the facts.
Torture is commonly inflicted as
Empty Vessels Make Least Noise
How many people are killed each
year by repressive regimes— one
thousand, ten thousand? The
number is tiny compared with the
number dying of hunger. Fifteen
million children die every year
from malnutrition and easily
preventable disease such as that
caused by poor sanitation—
that's one every two seconds.
Mexico's debt crisis of 1982
caused a 30% drop in wages in
real terms, a colossal increase in
mass poverty. So surely fighting
hunger should be the priority, not
indulging ourselves with fighting
for philosophical luxuries such as
'freedom'.
But both issues are inextricably
linked. The most obvious way to
reduce political opposition is to
give the population something else
to think about, and nothing
concentrates the mind so much as
a daily battle for survival.
Measures such as this are easy to
target, for example, if any area is
pressing for self-government then
divert aid away from it, and if the
farmers are protesting then raise
taxes to a very high level. A
breadwinner struggling to support
a family won't join a trade union,
or attend a protest meeting
because they don't have the time
or have too much to lose if those
in power decide to take sanctions
against them. Hunger has many
advantages over less imaginative
forms of political control: it
doesn't need paying and equipping
like an army and punitive taxes
raise money. Also it doesn't make
such an obvious story for the
foreign press which likes photos of
bodies, tanks and weapons on the
front page, not a body which has
died from a vims caught from
drinking polluted river water. In
Ethiopia, for example, the
government has attempted to keep
aid away from rebel areas.
Yet the way that the aid system
works is an open invitation to a
threatened country to use this type
of tactic. Firstly, the way the
developed world operates ensures
that the rest of the world is kept
generally poor, so that a huge
number of people all over the
world are vulnerable to even small
reductions in income. Secondly
there is a move away from
multilateral aid (eg through the
World Bank) and towards
bilateral, government to
government, aid due to the
increased political influence this
gives. At their worst bilateral
deals consist of free military
hardware, which provide excellent
playthings for the armed forces,
increasing their ability to inflict
pain and suffering on the
population and strengthening their
political position. But as argued
above, even when the assistance
consists of grain or cheap loans it
