Horoscopes
Aries
This week you’re about to leave home
when you notice a cupboard that
you’ve never noticed before. You
open it up and find your wretched
deformed twin sister that you never
knew about. Several orgasms later
you’re off to a new life at Imperial. yay!
Taurus
This week, in a desperate attemt to
emulate your hero Ted Bundy, you
brutally mutilate your room mate,
bludgen them to death and end the
night living out your sexual fantasies
with their corpse. No one wants to
join you. You fist the corpse alone.
Gemini
This week you looking up and down
your corridor in halls... So many
possible friends, where to start?
You go to your computer and code
an algorithim that devises the most
efficient route to take. The results
shocks you. DIE NERD DIE!!!
Cancer
This week you decide to chat up
that hot lecturer you saw for the
first time on Monday. You spend
lectures imagining his beautiful hands
caressing your naked body. You bet
80 year olds are a good fuck. Lots of
experience. Now you find out.
Leo
This week you attend the first lecture
of your life. It’s pretty boring so you
mindlessly fondle the girl next to you...
She takes! Gosh this is exciting isn’t it?
Ooh below the belt... Mmm warm...
wet... pointy? sharp? AAAAGHGH!
‘It’ bites your hand off.
Virgo
This week, overcome by sexual
frustration you beat the shit out of
that hot girl on your course. You like
to secretly watch her masturbate at
night. You find another drunk fresher
to engage in double penetration with
you. You send the video to your mum.
Libra
This week you’re puking up your guts
when a thought suddenly hits you;
can you create the siphon effect by
re-directing your vomit ‘back in’. With
a bit of tubing you succeed! Hurrah for
science! Unfortunately your roommate
is also excited... There’s no escape...
Scorpio
This week you break in to Charing
Cross hospital and rape the oncology
patients. You like them frail and bald.
Despite getting caught in the act, you
are let off by the Police because you’re
pathetic. You love men in uniform.
You masturbate all the way home.
Sagittarius
This week a baby (yes a human baby)
mysteriously finds its way into your
bed and begins to double-fist you.
Even though it’s “totally not your
fault” you spend the rest of your life
in jail, tossing salad for bald, tattooed
girls called Dave.
Capricorn
You have heard that University is the
time to experiment. This week you
trawl local schools, picking out the hot
girls. You prefer younger girls, they
are tight. Understandable. Behind a
bush in Hyde Park you finger them.
You’re a bad bad woman.
Aquarius
This week you’re walking back to your
room from the shower when you pass
a gorgeous chap. Before you know it
you’re being shafted to within an inch
of your life against the wall. Then you
wake up and realised that you passed
out while taking a shit.
Pisces
This week you find a stray dog in the
Quad. Out of the kindness of your
heart you take him in. You name him
Bruce. After sucking Bruce off you
throw up all over some dumb-ass guy
in the kitchen. He gets lairy. You stab
him in the fucking face.
Aunty McPickle is here to
solve all of your problems
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I broke up with my girlfriend just before
coming to university. Is there a quaran-
tine period where it’s not o.k. to get with
other people or should I just get on with
it already?
Yours Sincerely,
Need to Freak
Dear Need to Freak,
First of all, don’t worry, this is a very
common problem. I myself had this is-
sue in 1970 after Jimi Hendrix died, but
that’s a different story. The most impor-
tant thing is that what she doesn’t know
won’t hurt her (this truism doesn’t ap-
ply to footballs to the back of the head.)
Feel free to do whatever you like but just
don’t shout about it on Facebook for a
couple of weeks/months, depending on
the length of your relationship. But if you
don’t like that advice, there is a radical
school of thought that advises sleeping
with the ugliest girl you can find, video-
ing it and sending it to your ex-girlfriend
with the words “I’ll sleep with anything,
I just won’t sleep with you.”
Give me a call,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I’ve never spent more than a day at a time
away from my boyfriend and I’m really
worried about getting depressed at uni.
He’s going to uni in Glasgow so I’ll only
see him every couple of weeks. What can
I do?
Sincerely,
Stick to you like glue
Dear Stick to you like glue,
My automatic response is naturally to
suggest that you follow the course of ac-
tion taken by Need to Freak. University
is a brand new start. Cut your past ties
and start afresh. Come on! It’s Imperial,
you have your pick of the finest men
that… Well never mind. Otherwise what
you can do is this. When he comes to
visit you, smash him over the head with
one of your heavy textbooks. Then keep
the body under your bed. That way you
can be with him always….
Morbidly,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
My parents deleted my World of
Warcraft account before I came to uni
and told me that if I got another one,
they would cut off any support to me.
What can I do?
Sincerely,
I FEELLIKE RAIDINGTONIGHT
Dear I FEEL LIKE RAIDING
TONIGHT,
I will only say this once… GET. A.
LIFE.
With disgust and contempt,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have a secret fear of meeting new peo-
ple. Whenever I’m around people that I
don’t know, a knot forms in my stom-
ach and I end up regurgitating a nervous
nonsensical (sometimes accompanied
by the contents of said stomach). What
can I do during Freshers’ Week to stay
calm and make friends?
Nervously,
Social Scaredy Cat
Dear Social Scaredy Cat,
If you’re feeling uncomfortable then just
reach for the alcohol. It doesn’t really
matter which one, wine, vodka, beer,
schnapps... It’s all good. It’ll help you
relax and make you more confident and
sociable. And the best thing about alco-
hol (if you didn’t know already) is that it
is completely risk free... (that’s why it’s
legal right?)
Drunkenly,
Aunty McPickle
