The solid black squares represent the centre squares
of 9 touching noughts-and-crosses/tic-tac-toe grids
(3x3).
Player One selects any of the squares and draws a
O or a X in or around it - there are eight positions
around each sqaure left/right/above/below and the
four corner cells.
Player Two must then draw the opposite piece, X or
O, in or around the black square indicated by Player
One’s move - e.g. if Player One plays O directly below
the top-right square (i.e. its bottom-middle position),
Player Two must play X, in or around the bottom-mid-
dle square;

Bored Game
Ultimate Noughts and Crosses
From time to time you’re going to find yourself with-
out anything to do. In these times you should go to
the library and expand your knowledge of your course
to a superior level, allowing you to pass your exams
with ease and earn first pick of the top jobs the world
has to offer. However we know you’re not going to
do that and by the very fact you’re reading this we
presume you’ve completed all the puzzles on this
page, are penniless and/or stuck in a lecture. So
each week (until we run out) we’ll give you a game to
play to help pass the time.
What you need:
Pen and Paper
Preparation:
Draw the grid below (solid black lines only).
How to play:
Play continues with Player One drawing their piece in
or around the square indicated by Player Two’s move,
etc.
The game is won by the first player to form a line
of 5 consecutive Os or Xs anywhere on the grid, hori-
zontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Aslant Boxed
Castles Digits
Place a diagonal line in every
cell, slanting either left or right,
from corner to corner.
Intersections marked with a
digit indicate how many diago-
nal lines connect with it.
Loops are not allowed.
Divide the grid into rectangles
such that each regular rectan-
gle contains a single number
indicating how many cells it
contains.
Place castles/rooks on the
board so every white cell is
guarded but no castle is ca-
pable of capturing another in
a single move.
The numbered cells indi-
cate how many castles are
directly adjacent to that cell,
above, below, left, and right
but not diagonally.
The black cells are barriers.
Shade cells so that no digit
appears twice in any row or
column; no two shaded cells
share an edge; and the re-
maining cells form a continu-
ous region, all connected by
their edges.
