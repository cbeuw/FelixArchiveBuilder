FRIDAY 01 OCTOBER 2010
Album of the Week
Arcade Fire
The Suburbs
Merge
2010
On their third album Arcade Fire have finally struck
the perfect balance between stadium-ready anthems
and looser rock songs, whilst husband and wife duo
Win Butler and Régine Chassagne deliver their pas-
sionate discourse with a stronger conviction than
ever. Ditching the grandiose accusatory statements
against government and organized religion of 2007’s
Neon Bible, this time their lyrics focus on intro-
spection, coming of age and having to abandon the
dreams and aspirations of youth to fit the mold that
modern society imposes. It’s not all gloomy though,
as two-part finale “Sprawl” tells us it’s not too late to
ditch the suits and return to the wilderness. The flow
between songs is flawless in an album that clearly
outshines its predecessors. A strong contender for
album of the year. - Greg Power

Welcome Week gigs
Make sure not to miss
Royal Albert Hall
6th October
£7.50
Hush (with Rough Trade)
For a meager £7.50 you can bear witness to
three of the UK’s finest rising young talents in
an exceptional setting. After an acclaimed se-
ries of festival appearances, East London post-
punk outfit O.Children bring their brooding set
to the Albert Hall, well on their way to becoming
the “Next Big Thing” thanks to frontman Tobi
O’Kandi’s soulful vocals and impressive show-
manship. Hype Williams will turn the room into
a sickhead dancefloor with their unique brand of
psychedelic electro. But the act that has to be
witnessed live to be believed is Factory Floor,
a trio of industrial mentalists who will leave you
breathless as they turn pulsating noise into an
epic trance performance. Not to be missed!!

Phssst, Mingle Shmingle. We all know that
live music beats meeting new friends any day
of the week (especially Saturday.) On your
first night of university you need to be cel-
ebrating Ninja Tune’s 20th birthday at Ewer
Street Car Park with legendary artists like
Roots Manuva, Mr Scruff and Ninja Tunes
label founder Coldcut.
Failing that, head along to Dance Magic
Dance at The Old Blue Last in Shoreditch.
Girl/boy combo Peepholes will be combining
their electro vibes with noise-rock alongside
The Gentle Friendly’s unique brand of noisy
psych-rock
What could be better, on your second night at
uni, than a reformed Australian garage punk
band from the 80s (Ed - I can think of a few
things actually Greg...)
Hoodoo Gurus are guaranteed to blow your
ears apart at the Shepherds Bush Empire, one
of London’s best live music venues.
The Islington Academy welcomes hilarious
blue-grass rockers Hayseed Dixie on Monday
night. The name of the game is hard-rock songs
re-imagined with ukeleles, banjos and maybe a
bit of corn hanging from your mouth.
But if you’re interested in something a bit
more serious and a lot more melancholy, then
Junip at XOYO is just the thing for you. Ju-
nip are Jose Gonzalez’ soft-rock band (you
know, the guy who covered Heartbeats by The
Knife... you don’t know The Knife? Oh dear...)
Perfect for seducing that girl that you just
met on your corridor; feel free to use the above
piece of pop-trivia to impress her even more.
Each week at The Rhythm Factory, 5 new
alternative bands take to the stage and let rip
with a range of sounds from punk to electro to
hip-hop. Let Them Eat Gak is definitely one
to put in your weekly planner (but don’t be sur-
prised if people get a bit confused when you
start raving on about how awesome gak is).
Hush at The Royal Albert Hall is our recom-
mended gig of the week, and for good reason.
Quite frankly it’s stunning that three of the big-
gest up and coming bands are playing together
in our little posh neck of the woods.
But to be honest you’re spoilt for choice on
Wednesday. US pop-rock experimentalists Of
Montreal at KOKO are guaranteed to pull a
batshit crazy performance complete with over-
the-top theatrics and you won’t go wrong with
classic Seattle grunge band Mudhoney at
Electric Ballrooms in Camden. These guys
were basically the inspiration for a generation
of musicians including Kurt Cobain.
Male Bonding, the triumphant East Lon-
don neo-grunge act that is taking the world
by storm with their amazing album “Nothing
Hurts” are supported alt-rock duo Blood Red
Shoes at Electric Ballrooms.
But it’s a generous evening again with Errors
and The Twilight Sad providing a Scottish
double-bill of instrumental post-electro and
indie rock at XOYO and a night of psychdelic
folk-rock at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire
with Black Mountain and Black Angels.
This is the problem with music in London.
There’s far too much goddamn awesome
choice every night!
Your week ends in tremendous style as Impe-
rial Summer Ball star Benjamin Paul Ballance-
Drew (Plan B) brings his increasingly success-
ful rap/soul hybrid to the Brixton Academy.
But elsewhere in London, things are getting
fucking mental with Lacuna Coil + Slaves To
Gravity kicking names and taking ass at the
Relentless Garage in Islington and Archi-
tects, the finest sickhead hardcore metal/punk
band to come out of Brighton blowing the
speakers at KOKO.
Truly not a night for the light-hearted, but
by Friday, you’ll all be well-seasoned music
freaks
