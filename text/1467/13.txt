I hope you’re already planning on coming to
Freshers’ Fair but if you’re unsure, hopefully a glance
at this guide can persuade you to come along!
Freshers’ Fair is where all the Clubs, Societies and
Projects at Imperial are all given a stall to promote
their group’s activities and persuade you to get
involved.
On the day the atmosphere is fantastic as thousands
of students flood campus looking for a group with
which to practise their hobbies. Stalls are clustered
by type so if you’re a fan of the outdoors or a keen
musician you should be able to find the groups
associated with those pursuits all in one area.
However, I would strongly advise you to make an
effort to visit each area even if you doubt you’ll find
anything interesting there; coming to university
is one of the best times to begin a new hobby or
pastime, and even if you don’t see anything of
interest at least you’ll pick up a few more freebies!
We’re incredibly proud of the diversity and dedication
of our groups, allowing students to pursue almost
any interest they can imagine, so make sure you take
full advantage of the breadth of activities we offer
during your time here.
At Freshers’ Fair we operate a strict no trading
policy, so you needn’t worry about having to part
with any money on the day. Instead the clubs will
encourage you to sign up to their mailing lists so that
you can be kept informed of when they are meeting
and what they’re up to. Don’t worry about signing up
to too many as it’s easy to unsubscribe once you’ve
decided which groups you’d like to remain involved
with – initially the best idea is to keep your options
open and then whittle down your choices once
you’ve listened for a few weeks to what the clubs
have to offer.
Once you’ve decided which Clubs, Societies or
Projects you want to join, most require you to pay a
membership fee to join. Many actually run free taster
sessions to demonstrate their activities. They can be
a little daunting, say if you’ve never done ballroom
dancing, but many similarly daring people will be in
the same boat and the groups will be familiar with
and more than willing to help out newcomers.
If you do miss any early gatherings of groups you
are interested in, don’t worry as you can join a group
at any time of the year. Likewise, you can sign up
to any group’s mailing list whenever you like. Just
get in contact with the Chair of the group. Club,
Societies and Project contact details can be found on
imperialcollegeunion.org.
Enjoy the Fair and I look forward to meeting many of
you on the day!
