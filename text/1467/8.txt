in our nation’s capital. Pretty
good 3G signal can be had across
London on the whole, for those
equipped with smartphones, mo-
dems and portable hotspots. For
those in need of WiFi, London just
so happens to be one of the most
connected cities on the planet. Al-
most every coffee shop on every
corner offers WiFi of some sort,
whilst phone boxes and even some
lampposts about the city also act
as hotspots. Most are run by BT,
T-mobile, the Cloud and O2, but
having an account with one of
them normally means you can log
into others using a cross network
login system.
But what if you in need of a new
gadget? The ‘world famous’ Tot-
tenham Court Road plays host to
quite a few consumer electronics
stores and even has three tube sta-
tions along it, so it’s easy to get
there and back with your goods.
London also plays host to three
Apple stores, Regent Street, Cov-
ent Garden and Westfield, should
you be a Mac-o-phile. There’s
even a PC World, if you absolutely
must, located close to college on
High Street Ken.
London is a fantastic place to run
around exploring, but not all of
it works all the time, especially
when there are strikes! This is
where TfL’s journey planner and
travel updates are absolutely es-
sential reading for all Londoners.
With tube, rail and bus updates to
keep you abreast of disruptions,
Tfl.gov.uk should be your first
port of call before stepping out
the door. Smartphone users can
get TfL apps too, most are free or
cheap, or there’s a Tfl mobile site
for when you’re on the go. And
don’t forget your everyday tech,
Oyster card of course, because
those paper tickets are getting
mighty expensive. RFID baby!
needn’t be lost should you have a
good backup.
Monetary protection for your
gear is also important. Being a
public place, nefarious types can
get into halls, lecture theatres and
seminar rooms and half-hitch your
best stuff. It happened several
times when I was in your shoes
and those who weren’t insured
paid dearly. You’ll need a studen
insurer like Endsleigh who spe-
cialize in insurance geared up for
students at reasonable rates. Some
halls of residence also have insur-
ance built into the rent so check
with your Wardening team to get
the specifics. Stolen gear doesn’t
always have to mean a wrecked
week, if you’re covered.
Everyone needs music at some
point during their studies, whether
it’s for working or rocking a party.
These days music is available eve-
rywhere, some of it legally, quite
a lot of it not. So if you’re sick of
your music collection, why not
check out Spotify for your free
and legal music hit.
Using a client available for Win-
dows, OSX and linux, the service
provides 20 hours of streaming a
month from a large music library
with artists from EMI, Sony, Uni-
versal, Warner and some other
smaller labels. There’s the odd
advert between songs and ads are
displayed in the program itself,
but if you’re after music on the
cheap you can’t get much better.
If you’re a heavy user you can
even go with Spotify Unlimted
for £4.99 a month or Premium for
£9.99 a month to get Spotify on
your phone and offline.
Of course you’re not just here in
London to study, so your tech life
should follow you out and about
instructions. Your email account
can also be accessed using Ex-
change, IMAP or POP depending
on what your needs are. Snow
Leopard users will be pleased to
hear that Imperial runs Exchange
2007 meaning all your Mac apps
work brilliantly with your college
account. Windows users will need
Outlook for full interoperability
with calendar, contacts and email.
If you’re out and about, your email
can also be got at through the
Outlook Web Access (http://icex.
imperial.ac.uk) in any browser,
though to get the non ‘light’ ver-
sion you’ll need Internet Explorer
*sigh*.
Speaking of halls, tech doesn’t
stop at the door. Many Halls are
kitted out with LCD TVs, games
consoles, DVD/Blu-ray players
and shared computers. If you’ve
got your own TV with you (you
crazy kids), don’t forget you’ll
‘need’a TV license, even for those
with computer TV tuner cards.
Imperial, especially South
Kensington, is a pretty benign
place overall, but there are a few
things to be aware of now that
you’re here. A decent firewall is a
must and if you’re a PC user, get
yourself some anti-malware such
as the brilliant Microsoft Security
Essentials or Symantec which the
college provides for free. If you’re
connected to the College network
literally thousands of people can
find and compromise your com-
puter with minimal effort, so make
sure you use protection. After all,
you wouldn’t want to go home to
your Mum with a nasty infection
now would you? Mac users - make
sure you have your firewall on, by
default it’s off, because people
can still steal your stuff. Backups,
you probably hear this a lot, are
the saviour of many a poor soul.
From hardware failures, acci-
dents, thieves and malware, there
are lots of cause of data loss these
ays. Irreplaceable photos of your
roommate slumped in the corner
with marker pen all over his face,

Survival Guide 2010
All you need to know about tech life here at Imperial
Welcome Freshers! You’ve made
it to Imperial, a place where tech-
nology and life should go hand
in hand. I’ll leave that up to you
to decide whether that’s true, but
here’s a quick guide to tech at col-
lege and the surrounding areas of
London to see you through your
first couple of weeks.
These days you are probably
already armed with some sort of
computer, maybe even just a net-
book. But in the unlikely event
you get caught short, there are
plenty of computers scattered
around Imperial that are free to
use. Armed with your IC login,
you have full unadulterated access
to the Internet. Be warned that
there is a usage policy and ICT
is watching, Big Brother style, as
those of us who have fallen foul in
the past can attest.
So where can you get at a com-
puter? Well the Library has quite
a few, from the ground floor Café
to the individual subject orien-
tated floors with books (remember
them right?) there are clusters of
computers available for use. There
are also a few scattered outside
the SCR and most departments
around college have at least one
dedicated computer suite. Rumour
has it that some departments are
better endowed than others (here’s
looking at you Mech Eng), so
if you find yourself short in one
department check out your neigh-
bouring departments.
Of course, Imperial has a cam-
pus wide wireless network. Impe-
rial-WPA is the preferred connec-
tion and can be logged onto with
pretty much any modern device,
including smartphones, with your
Imperial login details. Some halls
are kitted out for WiFi, but many
still rely on Ethernet in rooms,
which is also a great deal faster.
Whilst using a non-college com-
puter you can still get access to
your H drive by using the Home
directory finder (on the Imperial
ICT website) and following the

counted rate from www.ultimatesteal.co.uk

Keep your password safe
ICT will never ask for your password so don’t give it
to anyone. Use 8 character passwords with a mix of
cases, numbers and punctuation.
IT Security Tips from the
ITC Security Office
Know your limits
Use of IT at Imperial is subject to usage policies.
Your Internet activity is logged and networks are mon-
itored. Check out http://bit.ly/ICTpolicy for more.
Watch your privacy
Social networking is great, but without appropriate
privacy settings your information is ripe for the pick-
ing. Remember, your personal details can be used to
get into your banking, your credit cards and email.
Backup your data
Make sure important files like coursework are
backed up or stored on your H drive. Never store your
only copy on a stealable portable device.
