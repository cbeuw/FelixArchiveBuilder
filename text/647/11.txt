Test Yourself
Although most people drink, few really think about their
drinking. But drinking is a process which involves all sorts of
choices. You chose what to drink, when to drink, with whom
to drink and, of course, how much to drink.
The BBC programme What's Your Poison? and the BBC
publication of the same name look more closely at all these
choices. If you want to put your drinking onto a sensible and
healthy footing, then you should watch the programmes and
read the book.
This leaflet concentrates on your own drinking style.
How much are you drinking?
The first thing you should do is to try to measure how much
you drink. The best way to do this is to work out how much
you actually drank last week. Begin with yesterday and work
backwards one day at a time. Although the figures are
approximate, you can use the basic scoring unit of one drink
as follows:
=
1
=
1
=
2
=
3
=
7
1 litre bottle of wine =10
1 bottle of sherry or port =12
half bottle of spirits =15
Work out the total for each day and then the total for the
week. Try to be as accurate as possible.
Now look at the TOTAL column. If your daily rate was
never more than 6 and your weekly total was under 30, then
you score A.
If your daily rate was sometimes between 7 and 10 and your
weekly total was under 50, then you score B.
If you daily rate was regularly between 11 and 15 or your
weekly total was between 51 and 75, then you score C.
If you daily rate was ever more than 16 or your weekly total
was more than 76, then you score D.
Before checking what these scores mean, you should
answer the following quiz as well.
Put a tick against those questions to which you would
answer 'yes'. You must answer 'yes' to at least one statement
in each question. If none of the statements are exactly right
for you, choose the one which is nee. est to your position.
