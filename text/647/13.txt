PORT
On a bright but breezy Wednes-
day afternoon and on winning
the toss IC took to the field,
allowing St Thomas' to bat first
on a flat track, which had a hint
of mischievous about it. With
Haptinstall opening the bowling,
the first ball bore a portenuous
omen, catching wicketkeeper
Harlow with his pants down and
going for four byes.
Some initially weak bowling
by IC made it look like a possible
200+ for St Thomas'. However,
IC fought back taking the last six
wickets for only eight runs
leaving St Thomas' with a score
of 157 all out off a full 40 overs.
IC went into bat facing an
assortment of U L U , United
Hospitals and random bowlers.
At first it appeared that they
would coast to victory with
Jarret (with a Walkman!?) and
Kelly providing the thrust of the
innings.
FELIX • • M M M M B M I
However, disaster struck.
Kelly and Jarret both fell and
the run rate dropped. The ULU
was now steaming in from the
Motorway and causing havoc.
The other opening bowler was
brought back at the Cabbage
Patch end and again caused
havoc. After Tear ran Bell out
the scene was very gloomy with
16 runs required off two overs.
This becarr thirteen runs off the
final over with Tear who'd by
now had got his eye in, on strike
(IC were also nine w! kets
down). The first ball went for an
easy singk. as did the second
ball (li required off 4 balls).
Te~ then despatched the third
ball for four—the tension was
mounting. The next two balls
both went for two leaving IC
requiring three runs to win off
the last ball. However IC could
still win with the scorestiedhaving
lost the least number of wickets.
Tear composed himself, remain-
ing cool, hit the last ball and set
off likewise did Heptinstall. One
run completed the fielder had
the ball in his hand, he threw
towards the bowlers stumps,
would it hit? Would Heptinstall
make it? No it didn't, yes he did
and so IC won in a thrilling
finish. (It was a good job Bell
wasn't running those last two
runs.)
Team: Tear (Capt), Harlow,
Helsby, Kelly, Jarrett, Fasey,
Bussey, Bell, Acford, Garrod,
Heptinstall.
Scores: St Thomas 157 all out;
IC 157 for nine.

Putney Town Regatta on May 14
was a very successful day for the
majority of the club with wins in
Ladies' Senior C, Men's Senior
B VIII, and even the-men's
novice IV, with over 20 years of
rowing experience between
them, rowed well to win both of
their heats and the final and
become Senior C. Everyone now
has a tankard on their mantle-
piece to polish!
A win for the ladies on
Saturday May 28 at Chiswick
Regatta was their third at Senior
C status and means the crew is
now upgraded to Senior B. Both
of the heats were won convinc-
ingly, with the crew pulling well
together to draw away from the
opposition by the halfway mark.
Thanks to Srimath for steering
•us to victory!
