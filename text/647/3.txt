AGM
The Annual General Meeting of
Imperial College Union will be
held next Tuesday, June 7 in
Mech Eng 220. It's a sort of
glorified U G M but with the
added excitement (?) of Stephen
Goulder awarding colours,
Union General Awards, Life
Memberships and such like.
There will also almost cer-
tainly be a lot of criticism of the
Exec. Chas Fuller (acting RCS
President and himself a member
of the Exec) is being incredibly
petty over the perfectly legiti-
mate sanctions imposed on him
by John McCallion over his
EDITORIAL
idiocy during the mascotry raid
two weeks ago. Mr Fuller is
proposing a motion of no
confidence in the Exec because
of this.
Nick Pyne is muttering about
no confidencing Stephen Gould-
er over his refusal to no confid-
ence Andy Grimshaw.
Andy Grimshaw may try to
no confidence me over my
refusal to print Exec News in
time for this week's FELIX.
But none of this can happen if
the A G M is inquorate. Be there
and vote your least favourite
sabbatical out of office!
PS: Exec News will be out
around lunchtime today.
Summer FELICES
This term most of you have to
work hard over the next few
weeks because of exams; I have
to work hard because all the
regular staff disappear to revise.
So I apologise that so many of
the regular features have been
cut this week and the layout may
look a little unusual. Next
week's FELIX will be smaller
still, I'm afraid, but I hope to
make amends with the end of
term issue (my last) which will
appear on Thursday June 16.
The copy deadline for this is
5:30pm the previous Thursday,
June 9, and anyhing submitted
after that time is likely to be cut,
mutilated, or (most likely)
ignored.

AN OFFICIAL COMMUNI-
CATION has reached my desk
from the joint pens of Messrs
Goulder and Grimshaw. Ad-
dressed to the Union at large,
but clearly aimed at me in
particular, it concerns the
furious arguments the two have
been disputing in the Union
Office lately.
'There has been some
disagreement between us
over the running of the
Union. This has not
affected the efficiency of
the Union, and we feel it
could only do so if the
matter is blown out of all
proportion. We feel that
further undue contro-
versy would be uncalled
for.'
I suppose it's a typical exercise
in Goulderian bombast, but I
really fail to see that with the
Union's two administrative
sabbaticals not speaking to each
other for the best part of a week
and communicating only via
written memos they can then tell
me it has not affected the
efficiency of the Union.
The situation is the more
ludicrous in that Stephen quite
deliberately provoked the row in
the first place. When he appoint-
ed Jonathan Miller as acting
President in his absence, it was
as plain as the nose on his face
(his own face, not Jonath-
an Miller's) that this was a
calculated insult to Andy.
But it is the last sentence of
the memo which is the most
surprising, particularly since, as
I have said before, Stephen is
normally most careful in his
choice of words.
'We feel that any further
undue controversy would be
uncalled for.' Leaving aside the
obvious tautology (how can
FELIX H H H H H H I
B E L O W
anything undue ever be called
for?) do Stephen and Andy by
use of the word further imply
that all the undue controversy so
far has been perfectly reason-
able?

MANY PEOPLE have become
concerned during the year at
President Goulder's love of food
and drink and hatred of exercise;
one unkind soul who knows him
quite well has been known to
remark that his laziness is so
great he can't even be bothered
to wrestle with his own consci-
ence.
Still, all this appears to be
changing. More than once this
term the great man has been
seen playing squash, and last
week, in the FELIX Office, he
shamed both Pinocchio and ICU
Welfare Officer Jon Barnett who
had been making futile attempts
to tear a telephone directory in
half by ripping it in two as easily
as if it were Andy Grimshaw's
throat. The pictorial evidence is
