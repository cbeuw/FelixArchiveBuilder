The studio was hot and the cameras were
perched like preditory birds in the dimness
beyond the interviewer.
'...ten thousand billion pounds to develop
this bomb from the Government?'
'Yes, for the R and D,' the scientist replied.
The monitors showed the scene cutting
away from the studio to the vaulted lab where
the bomb stood. There, suspended in vacuum
and wrapped in an invisible magnetic envelope,
was the jet black sphere.
'You see,' the scientist said, 'the Elastic has
to be polymerised in the absence of all external
energy sinks, because of its facility to absorb
energy.'
'And it can overkill Russia or America fifty
times?'
'No. Seventy-four. It could be higher but the
energy dissipation is not as controlled as we
would like. But we are working on that.'
He smiled.

STOIC
Hello, and welcome to the penultimate week of
spot the edit, hunt the cock-up and watch the
stagefright—or in other words, STOIC
programmes. Next Tuesday David Childs, ex-
film reviewer, talks to the producer of
Octopussy (note: this is not a Rita Coolidge
interview) while on Thursday Richard Copnall,
current celluloid correspondent, looks at some
more 'Films of the Year'. And no mention of
aardvarks in either programme—or amphibia
ion IC Radio. Be different —watch the
programmes—it may surprise you.
