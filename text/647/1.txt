STUDENTS FUME OVER EXAM-TIME CHAOS
Monro Leaves Weeks As
Residents Turn Down
Decorations
Re-decoration works in Weeks
Hall are to be called off following
protests from Hall residents who
claimed they could not face the
inconvenience during their exam
period.
The works were to affect a
number of floors, preventing
their occupants from using the
kitchen. This, of course, would
have caused considerable incon-
venience as kitchens on other
floors would have had to be
shared by a large number of
people. Students were also upset
as rumour went around that the
works were supposed to be done
during the last Easter break and
not during the term. A complaint
from a resident, Mr I Machan,
was heard by the Warden, Dr
Don Monro, who agreed that
the works should be postponed
from their original date, June 1.
Meanwhile, Dr Monro offi-
cially said goodbye to the Hall at
the Annual Weeks Hall Dinner
last Friday. In his speech, Dr
Monro said that he was going to
remain chairman of the Student
Residence Committee in order to
'fight against the Lauwerys
Report'. He said that in his
opinion it is highly unlikely that
the Hall should be used for
postgraduate accommodation
only, as the Vickers donation
deed states that the residents of
Weeks Hall must form a 'repre-
sentative group' of the students
at IC, and this would not be the
case if the Hall were only
occupied by postgraduates.
No substitute has yet been
named for Dr Monro, who has
been Weeks Hall Warden for
twelve years.

General Election Results
The mock election organised by
the Social Clubs Committee
attracted 314 voters in two hours
of polling yesterday lunchtime.
Voters completed both first
past the post and Single Trans-
ferable Vote (STV) papers in six
'constituencies' with the con-
servatives taking three 'seats'
under both systems (but not the
same three). Labour took two in
the first past the post but only
one under STV.
The six constituencies were
Halls, Huxley, JCR, Mech Eng,
Mines and Sherfield/Union. The
No. 647 wmm • i i m i i i i i i i
Conservatives won Mech Eng
and Mines under both systems
whilst the JCR (Labour) and
Sherfield/Union (Alliance)
results were also the same on
both occasions.
When considering the College
as orte single constituency the
Conservatives won under the
first-past-the-post system but the
Alliance won the STV election
by two votes after receiving the
bulk of Labour's second pre-
ferences when Labour were
eliminated.
Exam Students Disrupt
Window Cleaners
A final examination was disrupted
on Monday afternoon when
windowcleaners started work on
the room where the exam was
being held.
Half an hour after the start of
the third year Structural Chem-
istry paper in Chemistry Lecture
Theatre B, two windowcleaners
arrived and slammed all the
windows shut before starting to
clean them. According to RCSU
Academic Affairs Officer Brian
Stevens who was taking the
paper, the cleaners were tapping
against the windows and calling
loudly to each other. One of the
invigilators went outside to
remonstrate with the cleaners,
who left after some argument.
There had apparently been
complaints some weeks before
about the windows—one lec-
turer said that they did not look
as if they had been washed since
the Old Chemistry block was
built—and the department's
Director of Undergraduate
Studies, Dr Brian Levitt, had
asked Estates to have them
cleaned.
Jim Boucher, the Union
Academic Affairs Officer, told
FELIX that he would look into
the matter and ask for the
disruption to be taken into
account during the marking of
the paper; normally if a descrip-
tion of this kind occurs, extra
time is allowed at the end of the
examinations, but in this case
the invigilators finished puncr
tually at five o'clock.
Dr Simon Perry, the new Chairman of the Refectories Committee,
j samples a Mooney and realises the magnitude of his task.
