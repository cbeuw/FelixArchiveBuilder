Pimlico C o n n e c t i o n celebrate 21 years
New co-ordinator for student tutoring scheme
BY JONATHON TROUT
On Monday evening the Pimlico
Connection celebrated it's 21st
birthday with a party in the
Union Dining Hall. The gathering
was also a farewell for the outgo-
ing co-ordinator of the scheme,
Betty Caplan, who is leaving to
teach in Zambia for the V S O
after several years.
The Pimlico Connection is a
scheme initiated at Imperial
College where students volunteer
to tutor children in local schools
in their free time. It started in
1975 with twelve Mechanical
Engineering students helping out
in the Pimlico school on Lupus
Street, but has gradually spread
to include a total of fourteen
placement schools in the London
area, with 130 students involved
each year.
Now though, The Pimlico
Connection want to expand into

The outgoing co-ordinator of the Pimlico Connection, Betty Caplan,
cuts the birthday cake with current chair, Ian Gregory. The party
brought together past and present student tutors and some of the
teachers that they have assisted.
student tutoring in schools, and
have brought back lots of useful
ideas for the British scheme.
Featuring heavily at this seminar
were nationwide organisations,
such as C O O L of the USA, and
a whole new area; that of nation-
al funding and organisation of
student tutoring. Students Vicki
Wellham and Hester Shaw were
recently in Cleveland, Ohio, for
an international conference on
Israel's 'Perach' Organisation.
With the financial help of
sponsors BP, the Pimlico Con-
nection now plan to send these
two students back to the U S A
for this years assembly, the
World Conference of Student
Community Service in Wash-
ington D C . Also, Helen Mog-
lestue and Caroline Goldham are
to visit the Israeli equivalent, and
hope is to expand the help they
now give British children. One of
variations on the theme is that of
the Connection's French coun-
terpart's students visit prisons,
not only giving educational, but
medical and health advice as
well.
However, though last year's
Pimlico chair's met with Edu-
cation Minister Gillian Shepherd,
there seems to be no Govern-
mental approach to the idea of
student community service.
University chiefs warn Government over funding crisis
continued from front page
to refuse. Institutions have until
February 9th to submit plans for
new student numbers to the
funding council.
The alternative option for
vice-chancellors is top-up fees.
The vice-chancellors reacted with
surprise to the Government's
statement that the consequences
of top-up fees would rest with
the universities, since Ministers
had previously reassured univer-
sities that responsibility of
imposing charges for courses lay
with them. The chairman of
C V C P and head of Sheffield
University, Gareth Roberts, has
said that a one-off charge at a flat
rate of between £I00-£300 could
be levied on students at all uni-
versities in the academic year
1997/1998. He stressed that this
is a short-term strategy while the
whole issue of the future of high-
er education funding could be
considered. However, it is not
clear whether it would apply to
all degree students or only the
intake in the Autumn, expected
to be about 500,000.
Levying the charge would
help universities recoup cuts
announced in the November bud-
get statement. It has been esti-
mated that universities are £550
million short of the income need-
ed to maintain the current ser-
vice. Vice-chancellors fear that
the cuts are likely to be even
more severe because the Govern-
ment has not yet decided where
to find the £100 million from the
1996/97 accounts due to the
postponement of student loans
privatisation.
Vice-chancellors may consid-
er boycotting inspections of their
teaching quality, which the
Government requests to assess
the standards of teaching.
According to a survey by the
Guardian, vice-chancellors are
generally opposed to levying
charges and boycotting inspec-
tions, but there is a general con-
sensus of opinion that some
action must be taken to register
opposition to funding cuts.
Derek Roberts, Provost of
University College London, said
the Government's statement was
"totally inadequate" and the
warning indicated that the
Government was "scared" of the
vice-chancellors' actions close to
an election. He demanded that
the Government say what the
alternatives to top-up fees are.
Prof Roberts has angered his
students by proposing a "realis-
tic" top-up up fee of £1000 per
year, a third of which he will use
to increase academic salaries. "I
am not willing to see the run-
down of higher educaation in this
country in the same way as sec-
ondary education, if you don't
believe in fairies, students will
have to pay."
However, Martin Harris,
vice-chancellor of Manchester
University said cutting student
intakes would not bring in any
extra money. He told the univer-
sity's ruling court that top-up
fees, combined with a better stu-
dent loans system, were now the
only alternative to irreversible
damage. Gillian Shephard, the
Education and Employment
Secretary, had been thought to
be in favour of top-up fees as long
as universities took the responsi-
bility. But a spokesman said
recently that "the Government
sees no need for top-up fees and
is concerned they might disad-
vantage students from less well-
off families."
The Russell group of top uni-
versities, which also includes
Imperial College, has come out
against introducing top-up fees.
Sarah White of I C U has said top-
up fees are unacceptable as they
would be unfair to students who
cannot pay. However, according
to a survey by New Solutions, a
group of student union officers,
56% of student reps said that
"individuals who experience
post-16 education" should con-
tribute towards the cost. A sur-
vey of 1,000 students from
around the country showed that
53% thought that the taxpayer
should pay for tuition costs.
