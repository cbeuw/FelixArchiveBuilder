gig: teenage fanclub +
drugstore^
Not having had the pleasure of witnessing
Drugstore live, I
didn't really know
what to expect. As
they ambled on
stage, I thought to
myself) "It's going to I
be shouty". Thankfully, the reality was that the
band only lightly slapped us in the face with some
finely crafted tunes.
They managed a convincing performance
whilst avoiding such potential disasters as a cellist
joining them on stage. Only The Auteurs usually
get away with that sort of thing, but it worked for
Drugstore too. There is obviously a tunesmith at
work here. There are riffs that you won't forget
quickly and that are easily hummable and, as they
soared above the crowd, I began to think that this
lot could get somewhere.
Energy and enthusiasm abound from the
singer, who is all wide-eyed and happy, and
towards the end of the gig the subdued gig-goers
appear to actually start enjoying themselves with
that strange 'sway' that afflicts those who stand
towards the back and attempt to dance.
I enjoyed Drugstore's performance although
their songs do lack the energy for a really good gig.
You could say that their zero moshing material
means they are probably suited more to wallpaper
than wildness.
I like Teenage Fanclub. In fact, I more than
just like diem - I think that they're smashing.
Tonight, the Fannies have to work for their money.
After being assaulted by the absolute dross of The
Flaming Dps, the crowd are initially just a litde
unreceptive. The band admit to the crowd, after
some bizarre tangential reference to slippers, that
they haven't played for a month, and ask whether
it shows. Does it heck. Massive enthusiasm, big
talent and material from all of their LPs combine
to produce an energetic and thrilling spectacle.
It takes about seven songs to get the whole of
the crowd going but 'The Cabbage' soon sorts
them out. 'Neil Jung' then sees the kids going wild
and into the major crowd-surfing zone.
Verisimilitude', 'Mellow doubt' and 'Sparky's
dream' round off the set and Norman ruins the
encore by say-
ing that the
band will come
back anyway.
Thankfully, the
best is saved 'til
last with one of
the finest debut
singles ever,
' E v e r y t h i n g
flows'. The set
finishes with Norman going completely bonkers
and cutting all the strings off the band's guitars
with a pair of pliers. Then, in best anti-rock r
n' roll
style, the boys carefully lay down their guitars and
wander off - no Fannying about.

now living will never dielim
A tricky one for me to describe, this. It's guitar-
based, which makes a change, but it's on a mellow
trip moving towards psychedelia in places. It lies
somewhere between the Ozric Tentacles and
Stereolab (they share the latter's producer) and is
the sort of music that could inspire you to men-
tion, well, erm... sonic cathedrals really.
There are only six tracks on this promo copy.
They do last for a full forty-five minutes but they
tend to merge into one another after a while. This
is not exactly uplifting music and is probably an
acquired taste. It worked well lor me on a boring
Sunday night in, but it did grate slightly at other
times, especially the bit that sounds like the c.d. is
jumping (it caught me out twice).
Nevertheless, if experimental '90s prog rock
tickles your fancy, then this one isforyou. (6)
