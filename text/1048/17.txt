The closest you will get
to flying
To most people, even expert
skaters, the idea of skating
on ramps is a daunting one.
But a few of us from the
Imperial College skate club
braved the winter weather
at the weekend and
travelled to Rom Skate Park
in east London. Here we
found a bewildering array of
ramps, bowls, snake runs
and half-pipes, which all
looked very scary.
Thankfully the locals were
friendly and showed us the
ropes, and within no time at
all we had all got the hang of
it - sort of.
The experience of
skating ramps is effectively
like standing up on a rollercoaster that has no
guiding wheels, no track and no safety
harnesses. Needless to say we all were
wearing a great deal of padding. The
highlight ol the day was when we all plucked
up the courage to try the "Sugar Bowl" - a
twelve foot deep swimming pool with a long
slope going into it. What made this bowl so
lethal was that the apex went past the
vertical - and formed an overhang, so to
make it out we needed
to get tip to a ridiculous
speed and have no fear
at all. However
thankfully there were
no bones broken ....yet.
The skate club run a
number of these
weekends now, as well
as other events,
including the popular
night skates and street
hockey. If you have
any queries or would
like to join one of our
outings please come to
our meetings in
Southside Lounge at
12.15 on Wednesdays,
or write to
j.howard@ic.ac.uk or
a.cinelli@ic.ac.uk.
