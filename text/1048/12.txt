This is one of Sub Pop's newest signings and they
set out their stall from the opening track,
'Rawhead'. Imagine Mudhoney at their peak with
a female Mark Arm. This is perfect punk/grunge
packed with energy and, more importantly,
humour. There are twelve tracks that last just
under half an hour. As the last track, 'Jack S**t',
album: the bucketheads -
all in the mind,,,*
Kenny 'Dope'.Gonzales is one half of Masters at
Work. They are not only responsible for produc-
ing supreme house music, but also for mixing a
great many tracks by famous artists such as Bjork
and Julio Iglesias (although why anyone would
want to shout about working with that sad old
man is anybody's guess). Here, in his solo capaci-
ty as The Bucketheads, Kenny has produced an
album of good, but not truly great dance music.
You're probably thinking that you couldn't
bear to sit and listen to an hour of rehashed '70s
disco tracks. I would agree, but ifyou listen to this
album then you won't have to. The two singles
do stand out like Pavarotti at a weight-watchers'
meeting ('Got Myself Together' clocks in at just
over eight minutes, but thankfully we are only
subjected to an edit of The Bomb' rather than it's
full fourteen minutes), but the rest of the album
is a pleasant mix of jazz, funk and great drum
beats, utilising some old tracks by artists as diverse
as Chicago and Level 42. Indeed, one of the high-
lights is the blissed-out Time and Space' that uses
the Level 42 tune, 'Starchild'.
This is a good album then, and one which has
far surpassed my expectations. It is not jam-
packed with house anthems or many future single
releases, but it is ideal background music since it
allows you to enjoy it without you having to pay it
too much attention. (6)

finishes you are left wondering what has just hit
you.
If this album had been released during the
'grunge' era then the Teen Angels would probably
have been more famous than any other all-girl,
guitar band. Move over Courtney, the Teen
Angels have arrived. If you are going to buy a noisy
guitar album this year then make sure it's this one.
I can't recommend it enough. (10)
