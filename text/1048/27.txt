AN OPEN LETTER
TO A FRIEND
I always used to be slightly innocent on some matters, homophobia being
one of them. I was aware that it existed and I was aware that people had
been very badly hurt by it, but never had I been exposed to it. I think
part of the problem was that I had been in the closet about my sexuality
throughout school and at university until a few months ago. Also, my
friends, when I did decide to plunge into the deep unknown and come
out, were very supportive, it didn't bother them at all and neither did it
bother my family. I considered myself very fortunate but I felt I needed
the experience of coming across a homophobe.
That is why I have to thank you, you made me realise what people can
be like. It is for that reason that I have decided to write this open letter
to "Felix" as I want to discuss further some of the points you raised. Of
course there's always the possibility you were winding me up, but I think
not I think the first statement I will have to quote because otherwise I
feel that I can't give it the passion and eloquence that it deserves, you
said "lesbians are OK as long as I don't know any of them but gay men
should be shot." Ah what a wonderful statement that is, yes after being a
lesbian all my life and you having known meforpart of that life, I am
really going to change just like that because I told you that I was gay.
As for your second statement that gay men should be shot, I am
surprised that one so dedicated to the "true nature" as yourself would
need to rely on a gun of all things, I agree, what could be more natural?!
You did however raise another very valid point, I am afraid I would do it
justice if I didn't quote again, "Homosexuality is unnatural... I only like
the 'true nature'." What may I ask is the true nature? Another of my
friends interjected at this point saying that if we were only concerned
with 'true nature' then only trees and things that didn't destroy
themselves would be here, well, I mean, how ignorant can you get? Much
better to merely criticises something that happens in many aspects of
animal life, not just human and to call it unnatural. After all it was a
choice we made wasn't it!
I once again thank you for trying to guide me to the "right" path of
heterosexuality, I do however find it unfortunate that you will probably
not read this as it would frighten you too much even to be caught
looking at part of this "homosexual pull-out section".
Perhaps I'll see you around, or will you avoid me because you now view
me as a shaved headed, dyke T-shirt wearing, lesbian with attitude?
^leanwhile, I will continue viewing myself as I am and you as a prat.
