Hellenic-Cypriot final for basketballers
CYPRUS 42-40 ITALY-SPAIN
The Cypriot team will do
battle out against the Greeks in
the O S C basketball final after
just managing to beat the Italian-
Spanish team in the semi-finals.
The quarter finals were a
breeze for both teams. The
Cypriots played China and didn't
even sweat. The joint Italian-
Spanish team had a slightly hard-
er game, facing a brave challenge
from Taiwan, but were able to
win confidently.
The semi-final was a truly
close game. The standard of play
was much higher than any of the
other games with all players hav-
ing a good level of expenence. It
was a very fast game, with, on
average, a point being scored
every 14 seconds.
The joint Italian-Spanish
team was up by two points at
halftime. At the beginning of the
second half the Cypriots started
to steal the show, and were six
points ahead two minutes before
the end of the game.
By the time the Italians and
Spanish had caught up to threat-
en the Cypriots, the final whistle
was blown. The game was very
short (10 minutes each half) and
as with many basketball games,
the outcome was decided in the
closing moments of the competi-
tion.
Individual mentions must go
to Guillermo (Spain) and
Dimetrios (Cyprus) for their out-
side shooting as well as the two
opposing forwards, Alex (Italy)
and Stellios (Cyprus), both
Imperial basketball team mates,
who challenged each other and
gave an exciting display through-
out the game.
Greece beat Pakistan in the
other semi-final. Pakistan will
now face the joint Italian-Spanish
team in the fight for third place.

IC III 1-4 IC II
Prematch tensions wer high as
the K E N A R M Y discovered to
their horror that team mascot
K E N , was battered and bruised
at the hands of the seconds
scum.
The first half was a riot of
activity, with no team dominat-
ing play, but with K E N ARMY's
spirit's high and the seconds
scum low, the score remained 0-
0.
Second half: what can I say?
It was a travesty of justice. K E N ,
the mighty mascot, was not too
happy. Seconds scum fluked
two unjust goals before they
scored a cracker of a goal by
PLASTIC M A N .
K E N tried his hardest to lift
the team to a higher plane, but
by the time the seconds scum
scored their fourth, K E N was
fuming.
Thus, with K E N enraged,
C U R T A I N S slammed home a
late goal. We lost, though a
moral citory was won. K E N was
happy.
European Union: hot, sweaty and still friends: the Italian-Spanish
team 'thoroughly enjoyed' being pipped at the post by the Cypriots.

RSM footballers gloomy
despite successes
LSE 2-1 RSM I
Not the best day for either team:
they scored from a 'penalty'.
Man of the match Dave scored
the equaliser. Karsten's amazing
strike made it 2-1 to us. Keith
made it 3-1 from 30 yards. They
scored a header from a header to
make it 3-2. In the second half Si
scored to make it 4-2. The refer-
ee made it interesting. Some
good keeping helped us.
RSM II 2-2 ST MARY'S
The seconds' game was just as
bad. They required two goals
from Mark and an excellent save
from Paul to keep them second
in the league. More desire is
required from both sides if we
are to continue to improve.
RSM Rugby won 39-10
against LSE and ICAEC 1st lost
1-0 to LSE, so it's not all doom
and siloom.
