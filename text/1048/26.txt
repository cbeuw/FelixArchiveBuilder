Ashley Lumsden, President IQ - Imperial Queers
When people ask me why we
need a gaysoc at Imperial, I wonder
why they shouldn't be asking when
won't Imperial need one. We all need
to feel part of a community. Whether
that be the academic community of a
department's common room, or some
of the societies that have been
promoting themselves this SCC
Week, it is this feeling of needing to
belong that is so important. Lesbians,
gay men and bisexual people are no
exception to this. The important
question to consider is why this
minority do not feel that they belong
and why it needs a separate society.
Right now, Imperial is
changing its outlook. There are to be
more students and an even wider
range of studies in the one place. It is
also becoming more relaxed with
itself. Having seen these changes over
the past few years, I feel sure that this
line of change is going set continue -
provided that the people here continue
to think! It is only by question those
attitudes that have given IC a poor
reputation in the minds of gay people
that progress can be made.
Out Here has been written
with that in mind. It is designed to
look at some issues in a different way
- from the inside so to speak. I hope
you will take this opportunity to read
them and to question them. Then we
will have a new improved Imperial.

W h y I C N e e d s IQ
Why does Imperial College need a society especially for
gay people? What really happens at the meetings. Paul
Ragan writes from a personalpoint of view about what
IQ has meant to him.
It takes a lot of courage to
accept your sexuality in the face of
relentless homophobia, and it took
me many years until I realised for
sure that 1 was gay.
In many respects I
am lucky, because I have
been 'out' to my family
and some friends for
about a year. Coming to
London was, at first, dif-
ficult, since I had to leave
friends behind, but things
can improve quickly, the more peo-
ple you meet.
Most of my new friends here
are not gay (as far as I know), but
they don't know that I am gay. In
fact, I have yet to tell any straight
friends; I have decided that, if they
ask me, I'll tell them. If they don't,
I won't. The important thing is not
to deny your feelings or hide away
your sexuality, which is a totally
natural part of anyone's personal-
ity, whether homosexual or hetero-
sexual.
Myfirst impressions of Imperial
were quite positive: the huge diver-
sity of students of different cultures
and languages for example, the dif-
ferent clubs and societies with some-
thing to offer everyone and the
student facilities in the Union.
Socially, Imperial is fairly well bal-
anced and there is lots going on all
the time. The only major problem
is the ratio of male:female. As a gay
student, though, you can feel quite

isolated in any environment, when
you don't know how to meet other
gay students. It's great to be able to
go along to a group and feel free to
say what you like, have a laugh and
talk about things you nor-
mally wouldn't ever get
the chance to say. It's an
opportunity to make
friends, and generally en-
joy yourself. That's basi-
cally what groups like IQ
are there for. Even if
you're unsure of your sexual orien-
tation, it's still a chance to talk,
instead of bottling up those feelings
inside!
Personally, I've been going to
IQfor about 3 or 4 months. People
are very friendly (well, I
am anyway!) and there is
normally some event or
other each week (check
out the web pages, the
listings in the back of
Felix and posters). Some-
times it's just a 'social', to chat with
friends and make new ones. Other-
wise, there might be a visit by an
out-gay MP (like Chris Smith, or ex-
MP Matthew Parris), or someone
from a gay organisation or pressure
group (like Stonewall). I've met a
few good friends there, and we often
go to gay cafes (like First Out) and
I sometimes also go to other groups
in London - there are coming out
groups (like Turning Point), and
other social groups like the U L U

Has TV Changed The
Image of Lesbians?
What is your typical image
of a lesbian? OK we're stepping
onto the unwanted territoryof stere-
otypes and non-PC characterisa-
tions, but nevertheless, there must
be one.
Recently, there have been
a lot of examples of so called
"lipstick lesbians" on TV and
press. All the major soaps have
had them and the tabloid press
has had a field day, especially with
the "lesbian chic" phrase that
occurred around last year.
I decided to find out what
the image of a typical lesbian was
at IC and whether the media had
influenced opinions on it. Further-
more, had the view of the media of
lesbians as either a) ultra-femi-
nine, made-up, skirt wearing things
or b) ultra-butch, shaved headed
things infiltrated the opinion of the
people I spoke to?
The response varied from
"well they've got shaved heads
and behave like men and are ugly
- sorry Karen" to an attitude that
lesbians were just ordinary people
with 50% slightly feminine and 50%

GaySoc. The main thing is that you
can feel more at ease with your
sexuality in London than practi-
cally anywhere else. Coming out to
friends is the next step, but that's
less important than feeling comfort-
able yourself with your own sexual-
ity. So, if you're like me and fed up
with going to the union bar with
'straight' friends or just want to be
among people you identify with,
then come to IQ. Yes,
I was nervous at first -
everyone is, but that
passes quickly. There
are problems bein g gay
here, which applies to
society generally -
there's bigotry and prejudice, which
can make you depressed and angry.
That's why you need to feel confi-
dent about your sexuality and be
able to cope with the cruelty and
stupidity of lots of people. Whether
you're gay, lesbian, bi or unsure, I
think it's an important first step to
find out more about how life could
be, to realise that there are others
like you and to be what you want to
be, not what other people expect
you to be.
's:
slightly not. Interestingly, both
these views were obtained from
TV, the first person though, never
watched soaps and the like.
I also got told things like,
"there isn't a stereotype, it de-
pends on those that you know are
gay, erm, and if there is a stere-
otype, no the media doesn't affect
it much or perhaps it does."
The publication of Out Here
has allowed me, for the first time
really to find out whether other
people started off with , or still
have, these preconceived ideas
with which the media feed us. Sure
enough, such ideas have surfaced.
Attitudes havevariedfromthe stere-
otypical to the diplomatic, but on
the whole it seemed that the whole
thing about image is really an ap-
pearance thing, most people I
asked plumped for the butch type
image because, as one person
pointed out, it is easier to spot than
femininity.
I suppose therefore that the
media has not succeeded in chang-
ing people's underlying feelings
about lesbians in society by its
insistence on the lipstick-lesbian
soap stars. Does it matter how
many Beth Jordache's you have
when - let's face it - she was used
as a non-threatening character at-
tractive to both sexes? Normality
will perhaps be recognised for all
elements of society, but not for a
while yet, Forthe moment ifyou are
a developing lesbian take your pick:
would you rather be a Madonna or
a k. d. lang?
