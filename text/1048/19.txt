Jewish Society
Imperial College is to hold a one day
Holocaust education event in the union
building on 6 February 1996. From 12.00-
7.00, a touring exhibition entitled Another
Time, Another Place, will be on display in the
Ents lounge. This succinct and graphic display
sensitively tells how Europe's Jewish
population was tragically wiped out during
the Nazi era. Hitler's antisemitic ideology,
the use of propaganda, the formation of the
ghettos and the ultimate murder of millions
of innocent civilians, all form a part of the
most horrific event of our century.
The day is being run by the Beth Shalom
Holocaust Education Centre from Newark,
Nottingham shire. Beth Shalom - which
means 'House of Peace' - is the first centre in
Britain dedicated to teaching ' about the
Holocaust and its implications for
contemporary society. It is presently touring
university campuses around the country.
At 5.30 in the Ents lounge, Auschwitz
survivor Gena Turgel will speak about her
horrific experiences under the Nazi regime.
At the ace of sixteen she was confined to life

in the Cracow ghetto following the German
invasion of Poland in 1939. During the three
years which followed the liquidation of the
ghetto, she spent time in Plaszov, Auschwitz
and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps.
Upon gaining her freedom from Bergen-
Belsen in April 1945 Gena married Norman
Turgel, one of the British officers involved in
the liberation of the camp.
This is a rare opportunity to meet a
holocaust survivor and hear her first hand
testimony. This story of the resilience of the
human spirit in the face of unadulterated evil
must not be missed.
