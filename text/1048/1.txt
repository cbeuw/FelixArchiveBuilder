Fire services face funds cut
BY MIKE INGRAM
Fire cover around Imperial
College and all over London is in
jeopardy this week because of
insufficient Government fund-
ing. Proposals from the London
Fire and Civil Defence Authority
(LFCDA) could slash resources
at Fulham fire station by one fire
engine and 24 staff.
Fulham, along with the
Kensington and Chelsea station,
provides the major fire cover for
the College and surrounding
areas. If the proposals are imple-
mented, the station will have
staff levels reduced from 53 to
29. This means that only one fire
crew would be on duty at any one
time, with support crews having
to come from Kensington and
Chelsea. According to one offi-
cer, this would "leave fire cover
dangerously low... if there are
two incidents at the same time, it
could be a disaster."
The L F C D A plans to close
four fire stations in Greater
London, remove one fire engine
from 22 others, and lay off a total
of around 650 firefighters. The
measures are forced because the
government has set its budget
for 1996/97 at £253 million,
with an upper limit on spending
of £259.2 million. The L F D C A is
appealing against the cuts, saying

Another fire-and-rescue call at the Fire Station on Kensington High
Street: the cuts could mean that emergency response times will fail
to meet Government minimums.
that it needs a minimum of
£268.5 million "just to stand
still".
The four stations faced with
closure include London's oldest
station, at Manchester Square.
The station, a listed building,
covers much of the West End,
including several hospitals and
the area surrounding Oxford
Street. A campaign to oppose its
closure has been set up with sup-
porters including the University
of Westminster and Madame
Tussaud's. Fire Brigade officers
have warned that the loss of such
a crucial station in central
London would make it extremely
difficult to get to the scene of all
fires within the five minute tar-
get set by the Home Office.
The proposals are also facing
fierce opposition from firefight-
ers' unions, MPs, businesses and
the general public. A representa-
tive of the Fire Brigades Union
told Felix: "Make no mistake. If
any of these cuts take place lives
will be lost. That goes without
saying." Firefighters from all over
London have been organising
petitions against the cuts, collect-
ing tens of thousands of signa-
tures.
The final decision on cuts

Government
say no to fees
BY DIPAK GHOSH
The Government has expressed
strong opposition to the intro-
duction of top-up fees. It has
advised the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) to consider the conse-
quences very carefully on before
taking any decision on the issue.
This warning comes shortly
before the C V C P meet on
Friday to discuss how to claw
back the cuts in higher educa-
tion funding. The Government
may instead push vice-chancel-
lors to consider cuts in student
intake. In a document published
last year, the Higher Education
Funding Council for England
gave permission for institutions
to take less than their contracted
student numbers. The funding
council said this week that the
reduction in student intake has
been left "deliberately open".
They also warned that insti-
tutions which chose to reduce
students below the lower level
would be subject to having some
of their funding withdrawn. If a
large number of institutions
decide to make drastic cuts, the
the funding council would have
