Academic Affairs
BY MARK BRIDGE
The annual Academic Affairs
half day took place on
Wednesday this week, in which
student academic and depart-
mental representatives discussed
all manner of topics with acade-
mic and college staff.
This year, as last, the event
was organised by Matt Szyndel,
the R C S U Academic Affairs
Officer. The meeting was a con-
structive one where students got
an opportunity to raise issues and
express their views. Those pre-
sent included the Pro-Rector for
Educational Quality, Prof Alan
Swanson, the Academic
Registrar, Vernon McClurc,
Senior Tutors and College
Tutors, and the Director of
Estates, Ian Caldwell. Sarah
White, I C U president, chaired
the meeting.
Of the many subjects raised,
top up tecs, photocopying, cal-
culators for exams and library
provision featured prominently,
With a range of additional com-
ments and concerns about the
BMS project, Catering and the
sometimes questionable content
of Clubs and Socs publications.
College-wide photocopying
card variations was a topic of
contention with many students
and was also raised last year. The
matter has proved difficult to
resolve; Professor Swanson
explained that the various col-
lege departments had their own
budgets from which they sub-
sidised the cost of photocopying
and that it would not be fair for
a department to use up photo-
copying funds on non-depart-
mental personnel.
First and second year stu-
dents will enter codes instead of
their names on exam scripts
from this summer. The idea
behind this is to prevent any
assumptions as to student capa-
bility on the part of markers.
These alpha-numeric codes
might create difficulties though.
The Senior Tutor for
Computing, Margaret Cunning-
ham, whose department has used
numeric naming systems in
exams for some years now,
explained how there could be
problems under exam condi-
tions, where students simply do
not copy their numbers correct-
ly. Margaret Goodgame, one of
the College Tutors, added that
illegible numbers were far harder

News in brief

Assessment postponed
Ian Caldwell, Director of
Estates, has revealed that the
Biomedical Sciences building
may not go to a planning meeting
until February 21st. The delay in
obtaining planning permission to
demolish the old Chemistry
building, which should have been
granted at last month's commit-
tee, could put the project behind
schedule.
The current timetable for
the various stages of the con-
struction stipulates that work on
the building should start within
the next few months. There is
also a contingency period of
approximately six months which
has been allowed for, just in case
this sort of delay occurs.
However, this is not the first
delay to the project, as the con-
tractors were slow to move on to
the site at the end of last year,
and this took up some of the
slack in the schedule. Sub-
sequently, there is little time for
the planning decision to be held
up, and M r Caldwell admited
that 'things would get serious' if
that were the case. He remained
confident, however, that permis-
sion for the demolition would be
granted.
ICU doormat mislaid?
The continuing saga over the dis-
appearance of Imperial College
Union's front door mat took an
unexpected twist on Thursday
afternoon when it went missing
again from Royal Hollway's
Union building.
This is the second time that
Royal Holloway have claimed
ignorance of the whereabouts of
the mat, even though they
admitted to having it in their
possession last term. The mat
went missing from 'outside the
door' of the R H Entertainments
and Marketing sabbatical's office.
However, this was only discov-
ered when Sarah White and Matt
Crompton phoned from IC to
arrange a time to collect it.
The disgruntled Imperial
sabbaticals were informed that
none of the officers at Royal
Holloway knew anything about
the mat; it had just been left for
ICU to pick up. Sarah White was
said to be unimpressed with
RH's attitude, and comemnted
that it was irresponsible to leave
a Â£250 rug just lying around out-
side an office.
