It was inevitable, I guess: we
have had a Conservative govern-
ment for the past 17 years, after
all. But regardless of your politi-
cal disposition, it could never
have been possible to have the
massive increase in higher educa-
tion that we've seen over the
past few years without students
having to pay part of their own
way. (Apparently you would
have to put 7p on the flat rate of
income tax if you were to return
grant levels across the board to
the level they were in 1979.)
I don't particularly think
that charging students a one-off
£300 lump sum to study at
Imperial would be that awful,
but I can't see how that would
ever be the end of it. From what
I can gather, IC is likely to be £2-
3 million worse off after the cap-
ital expenditure cuts in
November. Lets say that 1500
students start each year (I'm
making up numbers as I go along,
because it's getting rather late on
Thursday). If you charge them
£300 each, you get £450,000,
which doesn't exactly make up
the deficit. Fach Imperial under-
graduate would have to pay
twice that much every year they
were here, if last year's budget
cuts alone are to be compensated
for. That's even before we've
considered the financial reper-
cussions on continued grant
freezes, and the fact that the
government is making a sizeable
loss out of the still unprivatised
student loans company.
I C U o n t h e r e c o r d
This month, I C U is on a publici-
ty drive to try and gauge student
response to the services and
facilities it offers, the idea being
that you write to Felix and make
comments about what's on offer.
In a couple of weeks, the line
managers will take over the let-
ters page and explain them-
selves. I C U gets given a fair bit
of money just to be there and
keep us happy, so if it isn't then
we should probably be asking
why.
Personally, I would like to
ask someone why the sound sys-
tem and the T V in Da Vinci's are
always on at the same time, giv-
ing the slightly disconcerting
effect of watching Sky Sports
presenters mouth the words to
Meatloaf.
