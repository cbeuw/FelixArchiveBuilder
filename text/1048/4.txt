allocation of space for group

It seems that the. new signs

lege have brought an entirely
new department for I C . The
Royal Shakespeare Company
have been given a few rooms
just off the walkway, where the

Sadly, other signage suggests
that we haven't actually lost the

Problems appear to be emerging
over the use of calculators fol-
lowing the recent introduction of
college-wide regulations.
Departments are forcing stu-
dents to choose a certain type of
standard calculator. Andy
McClure, departmental repre-
sentative for Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, voiced
concerns after final year students
were compelled to adapt to the
new equipment in time for their
recent round of finals.
Vernon McClure (no rela-
tion) said University of London
rules about 'compromising the
integrity of exams' and the
'excessive sophistication' of
some models affected the level
playing field of exams. He said
that students were having prob-
lems using different machines.
However, Mr McClure regretted
that the decision was made so
quickly: students haven't been
able to take advantage of the
financial saving a bulk order
would have given. Sarah White,
ICU President, said that I C U
bookstore will stock the new cal-
culator, though at a slightly high-
er price than Union had original-
ly wanted.
The Pro-Rector for
Educational Quality, Professor
Alan Swanson, said that it was
assumed that students may not
want to downgrade by buying
their awn basic calculator and
would instead choose to practice
with the ones provided for the
purpose by their departments.
IC consider charging 'entrance fee'
BY ANDY SINHARAY AND
ALEX FEAKES
Imperial College's official line on
top-up fees was outlined by
Professor Swanson, Pro-Rector
for Educational Quality, at
Wednesday's Academic Affairs
meeting.
The College has been looking
into the possibility of charging
top-up fees in view of the recent
Government cuts, and had been
looking specifically at two ways
of charging the fee.
Firstly, a straight 'signing on
fee' might be charged, whereby
people would pay a one-off
amount of approximately £300
when they ioin Imperial College.
Secondly, a top-up fee proper
could be introduced. This would
be in line with what many other
Universities are contemplating,
and would involve students being
charged for each year of their
study. However, neither has been
agreed for certain.
Professor Swanson stressed
that the Rector was not keen to
initiate either scheme, though
the Committee for Vice-
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) is meeting today to dis-
cuss the issue. He felt that key
decisions about higher education
funding have been thrust upon
them and that "the Government
[is] getting other people to do
their dirty work." Some repre-
sentatives on the C V C P have
suggested that they might threat-
en to introduce top-up fees in
May for political reasons.
Professor Swanson went on
to say that "the squeeze would
continue", and the level of any
fee would be set by the governing
body, subject to provision for
poorer students. When pressed
about the subject of a subsidy for
the less well-off, Professor
Swanson replied that a US style
system may have to be adopted.
In American colleges, the finan-
cial status of students plays no
part in the selection process.
Students are selected on academ-
ic merit only, and fee levels are
set so that rich students essential-
ly subsidise the poorer ones.
