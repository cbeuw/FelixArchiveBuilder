Don't ask me about the beginning of this film,
because I haven't a clue what happened! Having
arrived more than ten minutes late, I spent the
next couple of minutes wondering how I'd man-
aged to get through the door - the ticket said,
'strictly no admittance after the film begins'.
When I did finally look up at the screen, the
first thing I saw was three men being shot to
death by someone in a plastic white mask which
wouldn't have looked out of place in Star Wars.
Oh great! Tbis really wasn't worth mnning all the
way from the tube station to see!
As it turned out, I was wrong; it was worth
it, and I was pleasantly surprised.
The film is set in Los Angeles, where Neil
McCauley (Robert DeNiro) and his sidekicks
Nate, Michael and Chris (Val Kilmer) plan and
carry out a series of robberies. McCauley is a pro-
fessional criminal who protects himself by not
getting too close to anyone: "There's nothing in
my life that I can't walk away from in 30 seconds
flat when the heat is around the comer".
From the outset, he and his gang are pur-
sued by Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino), a detective
in the LA police department. Like McCauley,
Hannah is dedicated to his profession and, apart
from a crumbling third marriage, doesn't have
much of a life beyond it. He doesn't even let his
step-daughter's attempted suicide get in the way
of his work.
This film is about the power struggle
between the two: neither will give up trying to
get what they want, and right up until the final
scene we're still wondering who is going to end
up killing who.
Although almost everyone seems to get hurt
(mentally and physically), shot or beaten up, the
film rarely gets boring. My only criticism is that
it has a feeble ending, but I doubt that I could
have thought of a better one. In short, this film
is good but not brilliant, but definitely worth
oing to see.
video: mad bull 34 part L ^
Strange title, strange story - yes, it's Manga. If
you've been brought up on Mickey Mouse and
Tom & Jerry, Japanese anime will definitely
shock. No more flan fights, this is direct from
from Walt Disney's alter ego.
Part 1: Scandal is a tale of sex, dmgs, vio-
lence, corruption and Diazaburo, a new recruit
to the 34th precinct of the New York police
department. Diazaburo's first day would have
been a gentie introduction but for his new part-
ner, Mad Bull, one of those cops who shoots first
but can't ask questions later because the unfor-
tunate villain no longer has a head, let alone his
ears (sounds gruesome). When Diazaburo isn't
ducking gunfire, he's reluctantly following Mad
Bull to a succession of cat houses, and it soon
becomes apparent that his partner is running a
protection racket.
Mad Bull 34 is certainly a violent cartoon
and not one of the more inspiring Manga titles.
There are plenty more videos available with far
better animation and story lines, but this being
part one of a series, things may improve later.
