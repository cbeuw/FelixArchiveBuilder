ICU reception (left at the top of the stairs on the first floor of the
union building) is the place to sort out room bookings and organise
hiring out minibuses, amongst other things. At the moment there is a
special Vi price oiler on booking rooms out for private functions, this
is also the place to make use of the fax service, which is charged by
the length of time it takes to send rather than by the number of pages,
so it's cheaper than elsewhere. You can also get rape alarms free here.

Ok, so everyone knows that the Union runs the Union
Bar (the name is a bit of a clue) and DaVinci's. But did
you know that as well as serving the best value pint in
the area, that the Bars department also has several other
roles up it's sleeve?
For instance did you know that we can also offer
bar facilities at outside functions, (with a weeks notice),
we can help organise a Club or Society bar night, & you
can win all types of prizes with our special promotions,
if you're a sports fan then DaVinci's shows all the ter-
restrial & Sky sporting occasions on the only big screen
in College, and if you like things a bit more sophisticat-
ed, we also run a popular weekly Cocktail night. On the
other hand, the Union Bar is a haven for Real Ale
drinkers, especially in Winter with it's roaring open fire.
But if you don't want to drink, there's also a wide range
of non-alcoholic drinks available.
Finally, in the near future we will be introducing a
games night on a Sunday, so if you want to have a social
night playing board games with a group of friends,
watch out for the posters.
Apart from ramming the Union every Wednesday
& Friday, the Fnts. department now have a disco rig big
enough for rooms up to 200 people you can hire, with
Djs tor very reasonable rates.
If you're trying to organise bigger events and need help
in bookings, finding acts, equipment etc. then Mark, the
Events & Marketing Manager can help you. You can ring
him on 48068.

The advice office has negotiated with a local firm of solicitors
Aaronson & Co. (308 Earls Court Road, London SW5 9BA) to pro-
vide a free legal advice service to Imperial staff and students on
Wednesday evenings between 5-6pm. The solicitors are specialists in
housing law and immigration, both very relevant areas. If the service
is not used, it may be discontinued, so please use it. Initial enquiries
should be made via Martin Thomson, the Union Advisor.

Do you know we can order any book in print? 1,000's of titles are
available at the drop of a hat (well, a few days at any rate.)
If you have a fervour for fiction
a penchant for poetry
a gusto for goat-keeping
or if you are quite keen on cake decorating...
there's a book for you.
We can supply your needs (that's why we're here).
A special favourite for those keen on doing publicity for their club or
society, we can photocopy onto coloured paper for no extra charge,
and we have special discount rates for big bulk orders.
Come and see us in the north-west corner of the Beit Quad for
more information.
