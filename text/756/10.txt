The next MEGABRAIN will be the
Christmas full page. I need puzzles
for this, though, so if you know any
suitable problems send them to the
FELIX Office. You'll get a credit if
they're used (honest!).
In the meantime here's a tricky
long-division for you. The pattern is
correct but all the digits are wrong:

The winner was K. Young, Mat,

on the seriousness of the problem
perhaps?
sown& O u t in London
The 1986 London Student Drama
Festival takes place at the
Bloomsbury Theatre, Euston, for a
week starting Monday, 8th
December. Festival Director Sean
Keegan has been scouring other
festivals and colleges for months for
potential participants and
eventually seventeen shows have
been chosen. They will be
performed in the Bloomsbury
Theatre itself in the specially
constructed festival studio, which
provides a more intimate
atmosphere for smaller-scale
productions.
Apart from the main shows there
are lunchtime discussions and talks
from members of the RJC and NT,
Derek Jacobi, Maureen Lipman
and Michael Green on 'The Art of
Coarse Acting'. In the afternoons
there are workshops for potential
actors, directors and scriptwriters.
The evenings are filled with cabaret
acts including students and highly
original performers such as Jenny
LeCoat and the Joan Collins Fan
Club. The price of these tickets are
also available at £15.00, and so all in
all it is a very cheap way to finish the
term off in a cultured manner.
The performers are drawn from
drama and university colleges and
polytechnics from all over the
capital, and before you think that
we scientists are being left out again
Imperial College Dramatic Society
(or rather its touring group, Beit
Theatre, to be more precise) is
represented oy the play 'The Lucky
Ones' which was a great success this
year in Edinburgh and sold out
when it was performed in college for
three nights earlier this term. It is on
at 2.30 pm on Friday 14th and at
5.30 pm on Saturday 13th.
Although the festival is effectively
run by U C L , members of all
colleges, including I.C., are being
encouraged to join in. Tickets are
available from the Bloomsbury
Theatre box office but it might be
possible to make some block
bookings - contact Dramsoc (ext
3531) for details. There are leaflets
all around college describing the
events in more detail. There really is
something to suit all tastes, so don't
miss out on this opportunity to
enjoy one of the biggest drama
festivals that has taken place in
London all year!
