Letters FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 2
No Fairy
Godmothers
Here
Dear David,
In your last issue (FELIX 754,
Friday November Nth) there were
misleading reports and comment on
supposed College policies
concerning student numbers and
residence.
The College has not been asked to
increase its home student numbers
by 10%, but last year and this the
target for home undergraduates was
not achieved by about that
percentage. Policy is, therefore, to
get back on course as defined in the
College Plan.
In 1977/78 there were 4,470 full-
time students. The provisional
count for this year is 4,890. There
were 1,342 student places in College
managed residences in 1977/78.
There are 1,840 this year. Residence
places have therefore more than
kept pace with the increase in
student numbers over the past
decade. 1982/83 was the best year
for residence places. There were
2,064. It has not been easy to obtain
so many head tenancies since then,
but we have greatly increased
company lets which facilitate
private sector renting. If what your
predecessors wrote about some of
our head tenancies is to be believed
that is just as well. We also had a
better supply of short life property a
few years ago. Because of difficulties
in clearing some students out when
re-development was possible,
owners have become much more
wary of student occupation. The
College has, in respnse, made an
effort to increase the availability of
family flats because short life
property was primarily of interest to
married students. We have 28 now
and another 7 under construction.
The hall proposed for over the
swimming pool is not the College's
solution to the problem. There is no
single solution. There need to be
many. A hall on land we own for
around 175 will help but known
demand would absorb another
1,000 places. There are two major
constraints in obtaining more
places. Past surveys (and there have
been many) and advice from ICU
and SRC have indicated that
students will not be prepared to live
more than a mile or two away
(Hamlet Gardens has been quoted
as too far) and the argument has
always been that rents should be
kept well below those in the private
sector. There are no public funds for
student residence and fairy
godmothers are thin on the ground
in Knightsbridge. You cannot loan
finance residence places in the
neighbourhood of the College on
rents of £30 per week for 38 weeks of
the year. Accept rentals of £40 and a
5 mile cycle ride and we can be in
business.
Yours sincerely
John Smith
College Secretary
Double
Principles
Dear Sir
I would like to make a point
concerning the letter by John
Martin in last week's FE1IX (755).
He states: 'It is, in my opinion,
cowardly and dishonest to
distribute leaflets with no name on',
concerning the Anti-Nuclear Power
leaflets that were handed out at the
Careers Fair. May Iremindhim that
at the last U G M , at which Mr
Martin opposed the Barclays Bank
motion, leaflets were handed out
with Barclays Bank propaganda,
but with no name of an IC society.
Has Mr Martin got double
principles? At the previous U G M ,
there were leaflets handed out with
the name of an IC society that
doesn't exist yet. (IC Anti NUS, a
ConSoc by-product).
May I also say that I find it ironic
that Barclays Bank are to sell off
their South African subsidiary,
Barclays National. It was said at the
start of IC Anti-Apartheid's motion
against Barclays Bank that Barclays
would take no notice of IC Union.
With the result of the U G M vote,
Barclays already having privately
decided to pull out of South Africa,
the critics of the motion were
correct.

Gay
Terror
Dear Editor
I was astounded to read in
FELIX today (Nov 21) a letter by
Jonathan Davies commenting on a
supposed inference in Christine
Taig's letter (of the previous week)
that John Martin was homosexual.
Re-reading the letter by Christine
Taig, I really could not see how he
got this impression. As Christine
said in her defence, all she was
saying was that John Martin had
probably never been harassed for
being gay. Whether or not he is is
irrelevant. People can be accused of
things which aren't true with
damaging consequences. (Jeffery
Archer?)
A more important issue of this
exchange is that it points out very
clearly the terror induced in IC
males at the slightest insinuations
that they might be homosexual. This
amounts to a major repression of
freedom for those people at IC who
feel they are gay—but also feel that
they would be socially unacceptable
if they "came out". As an example, a
friend of mine who was gay felt he
had to drop out of college in order to
'come out'.

Free Chips
Dear FELIX,
I'm writing to congratulate
everyone on their efforts in Rag
Week—it was a good success this
year desite a bumpy start. Nearly all
the events raised more money than
last year and when all the monies
have been collected, Rag Week itself
will have raised just over £7,000 for
our charities. Well done!
Of course, the success of Rag
week lies mainly on the people, but
the hard work of all the 'backstage'
workers did'nt go unnoticed. Please
could you convey my thanks to the
Rag Publicity Team; Mike
Condon(!), Abraham, Mike
Copperwhite, Robin, Simon and
Robert for their amazing
enthusiasm; the Rag Committee;
Rachel, Nigel, Judith, Bridget and
Sinion and everyone who helped in
Guilds, RCS and Mines; the Rag
Reporter Emma (the guinea
pig—did you spot her at the beer
festival?); my own helpers Aiden,
Benjamin, Mike and Kal and lastly
everyone I've managed to miss out.
You were all great and if you're ever
in Liverpool, you can have some
free chips frm my dad's chippy.
Thank you to you also FELIX for
putting up with me in your office
and surviving my barricade of jokes
day after day.

No
Victory
Dear David
I believe that I put the view of the
majority of Imperial College
students when I express my
disappointment that Barclays is to
pull out of South Africa. I have
heard it said that this sell off is a
victory for the 'Anti-Apartheid'
movement; that it may be, but it is
certainly no victory against
Apartheid.
I hope that Barclays National
under its new name and ownership
will continue to actively oppose the
Apartheid system as it and many
other British companies have done
for years.
Yours sincerely

Rip Off
Dear Ed,
I am a resident of Hamlet
Gardens, living in a flat that costs
£175 per week. Beneath me, in an
identical flat, the occupants are
asked to pay £45 a week less. The
only difference between them and us
is that their flat is not rented through
Imperial's wonderful Student
Services, who quite obviously are
knowingly ripping off a very large
number of the College's students.
Across the passage from my flat is a
woman who pays £90 A MONTH.
I, and a good number of other
people, would like to know how the
College can get away with this
extortion. As if the costs of living
aren't high enough without this
official blackmail.
Also , what has happened to the
so-called security improvements.
Admittedly locks have been put on
the main entrances to the flats, but
we are not allowed to lock them
until entry-phones are installed and
God only knows when that will
happen. We were given keys for
these l o c k s , which were
subsequently recalled when it was
realised that our front door keys
would open these locks, all of them
that is. In fact the key I was given for
these new locks, which was identical
to all the others given out, opened
my flat's front door. If this is
improved security, then the College
can stick it where it belongs.
