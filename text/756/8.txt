Clubs. FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 10
Calling
Film Buffs
Are you fed up with extortionate
ticket prices and endless hours of
'Pearl and Dean' advertising at
West End cinemas? Are you tired of
squinting at a tiny screen, in a
packed TV lounge, at your hall
video show? Are you? IC Film
Society has the answer to your
problems. Come and see movies in
the comfort of your very own lecture
theatre....
Seriously, though, a Film Society
is one thing that most British
universities have, and that IC has
not had for the last four years, until
now. At most Colleges the Film
Society thrives: Southampton's, for
instance, is so large that the
Student's Union derives most of its
funding from the Film Society's
profits. Obviously, IC Film Society
will not be looking towards this
extreme end - Southampton has
£4,000 of projection and sound
equipment,our facilities are rather
more limited. Anything, though, is a
start. With a bit of time, effort, and
enthusiasm, who knows what might
happen?
The first Film Society event will
be a screening of 'Clockwise' on
Thursday 4th December at 7.45 pm
(doors open 7.30 pm) in Physics
LT1, and everyone is welcome.
Tickets will be £1 and are available
beforehand or on the door.
'Clockwise', starring John Cleese, is
a recent masterpiece' of British
comedy, and definitely well worth
seeing. Please come along - this
event must pay for itself, since Film
Society has no proper Union
subsidy this year, and if you want a
Film Society to show the films you
want to see next term, you must give
it your support.
If you have any ideas, or would
like to help run Film Society,
contact Richard Squire via Elec.
Eng U G pigeonholes. Otherwise,
come along on Thursday, where I
will discuss the future of the Film
Society with those people interested
after the show.
Consoc
Lobby
Last Friday, fifteen members of IC
Consoc visited the Houses of
Parliament on invitation of our
local MP (Mr. Peter Brook). The
Group watched the closing twenty
minutes of a debate in the House of
Commons, on AIDS. The chamber
only appears to hold 400 or so MP's
(so where do the rest of our
illustirous leaders spend their days?)
There followed a tour of the
Palace of Westminster beginning
with the Chamber of the House of
Lords.
This intricately decorated room
provides the luxurious setting for
the state opening of Parliament. The
group then moved into the House of
Commons where attempts to
occupy the front benches were
thwarted by ever mindful police.
Security microphones hang down
from the ceiling, making MP's
speeches audible throughout the
chamber-even in public galleries
watching from above with no need
for shouting /banging of fists etc.
The tour finished in Westminster
Hall, the oldest part of the complex.
(Having survived bombing
attempts, air raids, fires and floods).
The original lice ridden woodwork
is till standing, and the vast hall has
been the scene of many great show-
trials through history including
Charles I and Sir Thomas More.
The visit finished mid-afternoon
leaving some of the group at a loose
end until opening time. It is our plan
to make the visit an annual event.
Bible Bashing Ents
THE BIBLE (King James Version)
prophesies the sound of weeping,
wailing and gnashing of teeth. The
Bible! (Hewerdine-Shepherd
Verson) signifies the hearing of
celestial harmonies allied to a
heathen beat..."Patti Smith's
'Horses', Televisions's 'Marquee
Moon'...now add to the list of greats
The Bible! 'Walking the Ghost back
Home'....(Music Week)" "The
freshest pop sound I've heard so far
this year" (Melody Maker).
See them live in the Lounge on
Friday 28th November (tonight,
obviously) with support from The
Fleshpuppets and disco 'til late, at
8.30 pm, only £1.50.
Orchestra
Concert
Once again we approach the end of
the first term, and what better way
to celebrate this occasion than to go
to the Orchestra Concert (Friday
28th November, 8pm in Great
Hall)?
The programme, ambitious as
ever, includes Saint-Saens' Organ
Symphony, providing an occasion
to use the new Great Hall organ to
its full potential. This triumphant
work has been an inspiration for
more 'popular' works in recent
years, so why not come and try to
'Name that tune'?
Also in the programme is Bruch's
first violin concerto. The soloist,
Hideko Udagawa, is performing the
same work with the London
Symphony Orchestra at the
Barbican in February, so we look
forward to a truly spectacular
rendition of this beautiful piece.
There will, of course, be a bar
open at the interval and after the
concert in the JCR, so come to
Great Hall for a spectacularly, nay
sensationally, entertaining evening.
Jazz Club
Buzzing
The Jazz and Rock Club is buzzing
with brilliant bands right now. They
are showing that they can contribute
significantly to the entertainment
scene around the College and
intercollegiate halls. Recently,
"Stagefright" and "Blue Blue Ice"
appeared in Rag Week events
including, the Smoking Concert and
Rag and Drag. So too did
"Schroedinger's Cat", a folk band
from Physics, who are also reputed
to play in the Pearly Queen in
Whitechapel. "H2S04" deserve a
mention since they are a new band
to the College, making their first
European appearance at SCAB
NITE and snowing that they can
add a new dimension to Pink
Floyd's "Another brick in the wall."
Look out for this three-piece from
the Middle East.
Those of you who were anywhere
near Beit Quad last Saturday will
have witnessed "Bert and the
Family Scrogg and the Scrogetts"(!)
thumping out their lively beat music
to a packed snack bar. Meanwhile
the "Beat Bandits" are boasting a
new horn section ready for their first
gig this year.
But what of the jazz in Jazz and
Rock? I hear you ask. The list of
jazz-related bands is almost as long
its rock counterpart, "The Good,
the Trad and the Ugly" are a
competent 5 piece who offer their
services on business cards while the
established jazz club traditional jazz
band (as yet nameless, Jon Wood!)
can be seen at various times around
the College on special occasions.
"Chaz'n'Dave" (where did you get
your name from) are still going and
I suspect should now be called
"Chaz'n'Dave'n'somebody else".
Practising on Thursdays, the "Big
Band" represents a partnership of
jazz and rock, covering such songs
as "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "In
the mood" (Glen Miller).
I have tried to include all the
bands that I know of and I'm sorry if
I have missed any out. The really
important news is that a selection of
the bands above will be playing in a
special night of music on Thursday
4th December-the "Jazz and Rock
Club Christmas Hop". This will be
an absolutely capital event with
something for everyone. Look out
for advance tickets at £1.00.
Latest news of the Christmas
...Sandie Shaw plus her backing
band, who coincidentally are Jo-
boxers all (remember Boxer-beat,
anyone?) will be on stage early, so
don't hang around outside or you'll
miss...
Zeke Manyika and Dr. Love.
Zeke Manyika, ex-player with
Orange Juice, The The, Style
Council and Kate Bush, has a new
backing band consisting of
members of The Cure, Hugh
Masekela and Working Week - if he
doesn't sound good with that lot, he
never will!
The price is still only £4.50, £3.50
with ents card, in advance. The date
is 8.30 prompt on Saturday 6th
December. You'll also get free
mince pies, disco until late, a bar
until 2pm, and films like David
Bowie's 'The man who fell to earth'
and a light Christmas fantasy story
(and why not?). Hope to see you
there, and have a happy Christmas.
Rag Week has finally come to an
end and things are beginning to get
back to normal. The most successful
event of the twelve days had to be
the Beer Festival, raising nearly
£2,000. The only disappointment
was that only two people turned up
to go collecting for VSO on
Saturday (Well done Dave and
Mike). So we had to cancel the
balloon-walking. It's a good stunt
so we may try it again next term
because we've got 3000 balloons
left.
As for the rest of the term, there's
the R C S U Rag Mag being
produced, carol-singing in Covent
Garden and the RCSU Rag
Christmas Party on the 11th
December.
Next term we will be touring
England again on the legendary
RCSU Rag Mag Tours. The
provisional dates are Friday 16th -
Sunday 18th January for the South
and West Tour, and Friday 30th
January - Sunday lst (or Monday
2nd) February for the Midlands and
North Tour. Between these dates we
will probably do a mini-tour of the
Colleges within the University of
London. If you fancy joining us on
tour then note the dates in your
diary and leave a note in the RCSU
Office or physics pigeonholes for
Judith Hackney with the tour you
wish to join plus your name and
dept.
Also watch out for the Rag Mag -
they will be available next term from
the RCSU Office.
