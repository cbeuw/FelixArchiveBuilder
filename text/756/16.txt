A l l Central Student Services are under
threat. This means that not only ULU but
the Library, Accommodation O f f i c e , Careers
Advisory Service, Health Service, Extra-
Mural Studies and Audio V i s u a l Centre could
a l l be closed i n the next two years.
Some or a l l o f these resources w i l l be l o s t
to students i f the proposed 50% cut
recommended by the U n i v e r s i t y Grants
Committee (UGC) i s implemented.
I f that's not d r a s t i c enough the cut i s
being proposed a t a time when the U n i v e r s i t y
already spends over Â£10 per student less on
Students' Union f a c i l i t i e s than the
n a t i o n a l average f o r U n i v e r s i t i e s .
Any cut i n the funding o f the Central Union
i s a further attack on student resources -
and i f i t ' s ULU today, who w i l l i t be
tomorrow?
