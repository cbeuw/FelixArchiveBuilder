Guilds Raise Â£500
Health
Threatened
The academic performance and
health of students are threatened by
the decline in the value of student
grants, the Commons' Select
Committee on Education was told
early this week. The fall in the real
value of grants, estimated at
between 15% and 20% since 1979,
also meant that talent in the
working class was not being fully
drawn on - mature students from
' lower income families being among
the hardest hit. 60% to 70% of
students whose grant was calculated
to include a parental contribution
were not receiving the proper
amount.
The Committee of University
Vice-Chancellors pointed out that
the stress caused by financial
worries can result in under-
performance and health problems.
They also said that the social
composition in universities made it
clear that not all the country's talent
was utilized.
The Committee of Directors of
Polytechnics was highly critical of
Government plans to deny students
the housing and supplementary
benefits which they felt 'were a vital
part of the support system'.
A Funny Story
By Alan Rose
There were raised eyebrows at the
Undergraduate Studies Committee
last Tuesday when the ICU Hon.
Sec. regaled the assembled
academics with stories of his father's
garage, which he claimed to be
analogous to the state of higher
education today.
C&GU A A O Hugh Southey was
heard to hiss loudly 'For god's sake
shut him up Pete!' to RCS A A O
Peter Hartley, a task Mr. Hartley
was unable to perform. Mr. Colley's
reminiscences were greeted with a
stunned silence from around the
The Natural History Museum
announced on Wednesday the name
of a new type of dinosaur discovered
in a claypit in Surrey in 1983.
Nicknamed 'Claws' because of the
foot-long claw found among other
bones, the dinosaur has only now
been pieced together and studied
enough to be definitely classified. Dr

The stunt was devised in order to
ensure that some money is donated
to the Rag charities, as it is unlikely
that they will benefit from this year's

make a significant loss.

Students
Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
last week published projections of
Student demand for higher
education which are significantly
higher than those produced two
years ago. These take into account
the steadily increasing number of
home students, the proportion of
18-19 year olds entering full-time
higher education, and the growing
number of mature entrants.
Proportions of women students are
also expected to continue rising.
The total number of 18-19 year
olds will fall by one-third in the
1990's so a fall in numbers is
predicted, followed by a rapid
increase.
If present proportions remain
constant student numbers should go
from 693 thousand in 1985 to 700
thousand in 1989, 616 thousand in
1996 and 633 thousand in 2000.
However, if the trends towards
increasing proportions entering
higher education continue, student
numbers could be 723 thousand in
1989,691 thousand in 1996, and 723
thousand in 2000. Mr. Baker said
that the projections should not be
interpreted as statements on
government policy, but that he
would carefully study the
implications for the future funding
and planning of higher education.
Phoenix Hits
The Streets
This week marked the centenary of
the Phoenix, the annual literary
magazine of Imperial College. The
centenary edition was launched
yesterday lunchtime at a party in the
Old FELIX Office, Beit Building.
But the week's celebrations
started with a lecture from John
Maddox, Editor of Nature
magazine, held on Tuesday. A
packed Read lecture theatre listened
to Maddox argue that 'Scientists
cannot write to save their lives'. He
illustrated his argument with
examples of scientists who have
falsified their results, as well as
examples of poor writing.
Maddox also argued that
scientists write too much, in a frantic
effort to save their careers by
amassing as many papers as
possible.
A lively question and answer
session followed the talk. One
member of the audience questioned
Maddox's constant use of the
pronoun 'he' to refer to scientists,
and suggested that this may put
women off science. Maddox
challenged the questioner to
produce data to support the
argument that this convention had
any effect on recruitment of women
into science.
A careers seminar, for students
who wish to becomejournalists, was
held on Wednesday in Mech. Eng.
220. The audience was able to fire
questions at Wynford Hicks,
freelance journalist and lecturer in
journalism; Nina Hall, science
correspondent of the Times Higher
Education Supplement, soon to be
physical science editor of the New
Scientist;aad Shiona Llewellyn,
careers advisor at IC, and sometime
managing editor of Radio Times and
Time Out.
Tonight is the climax of the
centenary week celebrations, the
grand centenary dinner at the
Rector's residence, 170 Queen's
Gate. Guests will be treated to fine
wines, food and music, with string
quartet and jazz band.
Many ex-editors of Phoenix will
be present, including Prof. Sir
Geoffrey Wilkinson, editor of
Phoenix in 1942, and the only editor
to have received a Nobel prize (so
far).
This year's editor, like many of
his predecessors, is a chemistry
student. Christopher Edwards'
edition of the Phoenix is available,
price 50p, from the bookshop,
libraries, and FELIX Office.
