Union Services
President Christine Taig enthuses
about special events in Services
Week.
Imperial College
Union will be 75 years
old next month. In
celebration of this
momentous occassion
ICU is organision a
series of events to
promote the Union-
run services; the Bar,
the Snack Bar, the
Bookshop and the
Sports Shop.
Ask any old past student of Imperial
College (and you'll generally find
plenty hanging around in Southside
or the Union Bar) and they'll tell
you that the Students' Union has
changed beyond all recognition over
the last decade or so. The major
change has been the provision of
services as a prominent feature of
the Union...from being little more
than a conglomeration of clubs and
representatives on various college
bodies, the Union has developed
into quite a trading venture, running
its own bars, snack bar, bookshop,
sportshop; with a host of rooms and
facilities for students to use.
The changes continue; the
Union's 75th anniversary falls in the
year when we are having to look
seriously at our organisation, trying
to make ourselves more efficient in
order to cope with the increased
pressures of running our trading
outlets. The probable inclusion of
St. Mary's Hospital Medical School
into the Imperial College fold' is
another big change on our horizon,
which will probably precipitate even
more expansion of the aims and
services of the Union.
To mark the 75th anniversary of
the Union we have decided to
concentrate on the Union's trading
outlets with a 'Services Week'. The
Union's trading outlets are vital to
its existence; not only are they low-
cost, good value services run by
students for students; but also any
profit made goes straight back into
improving Union facilities.
Those who see the Students'
Union as a hotbed of radicalism full
of shifty individuals trying to further
their political careers couldn't be
further off the point (you're
welcome to come and spend a day in
the office if you don't believe me!) -
the majority of the time seems to be
spent rushing round trying to
coordinate the activities of over a
hundred clubs, ensuring that the
bills get paid and trying to stop the
building falling apart—all on a very
limited budget
However I don't think we do so
badly—and now's your chance to
find out for yourself.
There's a special event in the
Union building every day from
Tuesday to Friday—starting with
the best birthday party around with
live music, discos, videos...not to be
missed. Wednesday's Australian
night should be mind-blowing—and
expect to see a few St. Mary's
students around that night. On
Thursday we have a touch of
tradition with a combined C C U
night in the bar; and on Friday the
more sophisticated amongst you
can book a table for a meal in
Norman's with impeccable service
and cocktails to boot. Then on
Saturday we take over the Sherfield
building (now there's an idea;..) for
the Great Anniversary Carnival
with Sandie Shaw and Zeke
Manyika. All in all a week not to be
missed — and you thought
everything stopped after Rag
Week...
Services week extends further
than the Union building though;
don't forget the special offers in the
bookshop and sportshop. And we
still have a trick up our sleeve; to
liven up the Birthday U G M on
Tuesday, 2nd December, there's a
special appearance by Martin S
Taylor who'll be performing a few
magic tricks.
Well, enjoy the week; and if you
feel like a 75 year old by the end of it,
I don't suppose you'll be the only
one...
there's the
Union Sports Shop
Internal Services Officer Alan Rose
goes on a bit about his job and
repeats a few things Christine said.
In addition to its many other roles,
ICU runs four trading outlets, all
offering goods to students at knock-
down prices. The Bookshop, which
has been around for over ten years,
has more recently been joined by the
Sports Shop (also on the Sherfield
Walkway) the Union Snack Bar
('Normans') and, most recently, The
Union Bar.
Although primarily a service, all
four are run as profit-making
concerns in order to cope with their
inevitable slack periods of business.
There is no other sensible way to
manage a £'/2 million annual
turnover.
Any profit that is made by the
outlets can go either on improving
the quality of the service offered (eg
the video recorder and music system
for the Union Bar or the
refurbishment programme in
Norman's) or directly into Union
Funds (eg the dividends paid by the
Bookshop to ICU and the three
CCU's).
Each outlet is run on a day-to-day
basis by a full time manager who is
answerable to a management
committee. These committees are
co-ordinated by the Internal
Services Committee which also
handles interaction and long term
planning. The ISC is answerable to
the IC U G M through the Internal
Services Officer.
The last year, 1985/6 was a very
successful one for Union Services
with all four trading outlets showing
a surplus (profit). Therefore, to
coincide with ICU's 75th birthday
next week, there will be a number of
promotional events which you are
all invited to take advantage of in
recognition of the great support that
you have given to your trading
outlets.

Bar Manager Kev
Buckley tries to grab
some custom.
At the start of term, when the new
lounge bar was opened, it was hoped
that the comfortable seating
combined with food and beer
outlets would draw people back to
the union building and re-establish
it as the main social centre for
students at I.C.
Some people expressed the
opinion that the 'rowdy' image
would keep people away, while
others quite rightly felt that the
toning down of the bar by this year
sabaticals would make it
unacceptable to the rowdier, heavy
spending elements, leading again to
a loss of trade.
Most of the feedback received,
would indicate both sides of the
argument well catered for. Yes there
has been standing on tables, loud
singing, and some naked-yard-
drinking, but it has been done in
such a way than no-one to my
knowledge has been offended. The
rowdy image 'too much or not
enough?' issue would seem to have
been settled.
As for the hope of a new thriving
social centre, well...we've tried
putting events on, but the lack of an
I.C. Publicity Officer has hampered
attempts to make people aware of
them. Those that have turned up
have had a great time, eg...
Bert and family Scrogg on Sat
22nd, one of a series of cheap beer,
late disco, live music Sat nights.
Most people came because they
were led to believe it was 'a name
band', very few were disappointed
by the act put on by a mere college
band though. Some were even 'well
impressed mate'. Nearly every Sat
night this format of entertainment
has been used, but because everyone
knew it was 'only a college band' no-
one turned up. What does it take to
make students walk from the
Southside Halls to the Union?
Regular happy hours Tues and
Thurs? Sat entertainment? videos
most nights?
If the answer is yes well all this has
already been happening, where are
you?
If the answer is no, then what?
Are most students so idle that the
two minutes they save by using
Southside's facilities is a prime
factor? Let's hope not.
