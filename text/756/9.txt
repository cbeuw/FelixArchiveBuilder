Korjball
Potential
On Sunday 23rd November, the
University of London Korfball team
travelled to Oxford for the second
tournament of the season as
reigning champions. Four of the
players were from Imperial College.
Being severely weakened by a low
turnout, U.L. struggled to their first
victory over Brighton B, 2—1, and
Sheffield, 3—0. Hence for the
second successive tournament they
qualified for the final against
Brighton Polytechnic.
This time however, U.L. had an
extremely inexperienced team and
suffered another blow when one of
their more competent players
aggravated an old hand injury.
Brighton took an early lead, and
with a solid looking defence, seemed
to have the title in their grasp-but in
the last two minutes, U.L scored a
deserved equaliser to force the game
into a penalty shoot out in which
inexperience from U.L. showed with
Brighton winning 3—2.
Despite losing the title, this was a
creditable performance from a team
who have a lot of potential for the
future.
Windpower
On Sunday 23th November IC
sailing club were hosted a match
against Essex University. The
weather conditions, with a strong,
gusting wind, looked likely to
created exciting competition. In the
first race IC had a commanding
start but Essex clawed back to have
overall lead at the first mark.
However, disaster struck at the gybe
mark with half the fleet capsizing,
leaving IC to coast home with a 2
boat to 1 advantage, it was decided
to reef for the second race but this
still did'nt stop one of the Essex
crews going for a swim again and IC
capitalized on the advantage.
After lunch the wind moderated
and it was back to full rigs. The IC
starts fluctuated as much as the
wind but the poor starts were
compensated by superior team
tactics which made for close and
exciting racing with races going each
way. In all, the success of the IC
team, under the guidance of acting
Captain Apostolos Leonidho-
poulos, proved to be the best
performance of the season.
Team:Apostolos Leonidhopoulos,
Richard Brimelow, Richard Jarman,
Gareth David, Charles, Adam
Stork, Andrea Burrows, Daniel
Lucas-Clements.
Football
Unbeaten
IC continued their unbeaten start to
the season in all competitions to 12
games in a very tough, bruising
encounter against a very physical
Essex side.
IC, as usual, started slowly
against a very fit Essex outfit, but
chances were very few and far
between. Essex, against the run of
play, took the lead, when weak
tackling on the edge of the IC box,
allowed their centre-forward to
score. IC's response was swift, and
Paul Olden rose above the crowd to
head the equaliser from a Simon
Cole free-kick. The half-time score
remained at 1-1.
Essex took almost complete
control in the second half, once
again showig IC the fitness value of
a full-time trainer, but their pressure
generally amounted to nothing.
Paradoxically, perhaps, the best
chance in this period fell to Nigel
Collier, whose lob went over the
crossbar. IC's lot seemed to be up
when Essex took the lead with 15
minutes to go. But again IC showed
their character and equalised within
a minute, Alex Lunghis shot was not
held by the Essex Keeper and Paul
Olden again on hand to bundle the
ball home. The score remained at
2—2 till the end.
The replay is on Tuesday, again at
Colchester.
Team.A. Allen, M. Bradley, P.
Ewart, P. Dyson, L. Covill, B.
Wood, S. Cole, P. Olden, A.
Lunghi (Capt), D. Lynne, N.
Collier, Sub:N. Campbell.
Poetic
Justice
Darkness had almost comletely
fallen, and with 15 seconds of extra
time left IC won a corner. Keelin
floated the ball beautifully, the ball
skimmed over Wilson's head, and
then suddenlyfrom the darkness leapt
the IC skipperMark Barrow. The ball
was headed firmly and after a
deflection it was in the back ofthe net.
Thus penalties were avoided and IC
IPs were through to the next round of
the UAU.
Although in overall play IC were
not up to the standard they showedon
Wednesday, they again showed guts
and determination to come from
behind twice. Russ Hardy (the ITs
leading goalscorer) scored an
individual goal to tie ti at 1-1. But
early in the second half they were a
goal behind again. Then the IC spirit
really showed as theypushedforward
in desperation to stay in the
competition. Their just reward came
7 minutes from full time when a
goalmouth scramblefell to J. Wilson
who hammered the ball homefrom 7
yards, much to the delight of the
players and the fans.
Hall v Hall
Spectators in Hyde Park were
treated to a mind-boggling display
of skill and pace as the two foremost
Southside teams did battle on a
greasy pitch on Sunday. Selkirk
quickly took advantage of superior
play to take the lead through
skipper M . Birmingham. F L K ,
however instantly struck back with
a back-header by A. Haines (own
goal!) Selkirk used a strong
following wind to their advantage to
go in at the interval 2—1 up.
With the wind at their backs,
Falmouth produced two quick goals
by use of good lofted balls at the
start of the second period (3—2).
Birmingham rallied his team and
due to some good work in midfield
by J. Martin and C. Morris, Selkirk
equalised with the best goal of the
match-A diving header by I.
Charlton.
The game was decided when J.
Street, surely the most outstanding
centreback I.C. has seen in years,
was forced to handle the ball on the
line. The penalty was converted to
settle the score.
3rds
On Saturday the 3rds gained an
impressive draw against L H 2nds.
Dominating the early stages with
support from a strong following
wind, some good attacking moves
resulted in several efforts. Wendel
Charles put the 3rds ahead
outpacing the home defence and
lobbing the advancing'keeper.
Wendel fired wide a few minutes
later and Mark Woodgate just failed
to meet Martin Lake's flighted free
kick, after a well-timed run.
The home team equalised when
Mike Kemp, injured from a
previous collision, could only palm
the ball onto an opposing player's
head, who was unmarked at the far
post. As the pitch deteriorated,
some heavy tackling and muddy
conditions meant 8 ofthe 22 players
were down injured in the second half
at some time. Chris Budgen limped
off with twenty minutes left, made a
token but somewhat ineffective re-
appearance before retiring his
services. The remaining ten players
grafted for the remainder of the
match, securing a draw. Thanks to
John Galloway for turning in a solid
performance in place of Kevin
Graves, who had offered his
formidable bulk for the needy cause
of the Ists.
3rds Again
Last Wednesday IC 3rds travelled to
Collier's Wood looking for their
first league win. Only half the
opposition turned up and when the
other half arrived, the match was
only allowed to be 30 minutes each
way.
IC seized the early initiative
queueing up in threes to squander
early chances due to dithering when
shooting would certainly have been
more effective in the wet swirling
conditions. A somewhat surprising
goal put the 3rds ahead when Mike
Plummer wrestled with the K C H
goal keeper and Martin Dixon
bundled the- ball, and himself, into
the net.
The opposition launched counter
attacks swiftly, but a gritty team
defensive display in the second half
secured the victory
The 3rds held out to secure their
first win, encouraging since they
were not playing at their best. Mike
Kemp the ex-6th team goalkeeper
made a solid debut, commanding
his defence well and making three
outstanding saves.
Team:M. Kemp, C. Gordon, M.
Woodgat (C), M. Lake, K. Graves,
C. Budgen, P. Thompson, D.
Semeria, M. Plummer, M. Dixon,
W. Charles, H. Takano.
