News FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 3
Dragging Our Feet
The Barclays issue is old news, it
seems. I do not want to return to an
argument which has so inelegantly
fdled the FELIX letters page over
recent weeks, but it is impossible not
to be struck by the irony of the
situation. Students Unions all over
the country have been campaigning
against Barclaysfor years, and even
the most cynical observer would not
uphold the Barclays statement that
the decision to sever links with South
Africa was made on economic
grounds only. The public feeling
generated against the bank was the
major factor. Here at Imperial
College we 'almost had policy' on
Barclays a couple of weeks before
they pulled out.
Before provoking another rabid
selection of letters I should stress that
I am not arguing over the crime any
more. The matterfor concern is that
it seems almost impossible for IC
Union to be mobilised into any
concerted political action. Many
would say that this is a good thing; I
do not. Iam not attacking thefamous
IC apathy here. There are many
students at this College who makefull
use of theirfree time, and are happy
to support Union events. Rather,
there is a widespread phobia of
political debate at Union level, and it
is not because the student body is
truly 'apolitical'. Even the more
liberal-thinking members of Council
tend to come over as rather cynical,
and I cannot avoid the conclusion that
it is the burdens of internal
administration which effect many
people's attitudes. I can guarantee a
postbagfull of poison pen letters if I
suggest that IC Union should affdiate
to the NUS; I shall suggest it anyway.
The ancient argument that the cost to
the Union, in terms of the inevitable
cutting of clubs, is too high apricejust
doesn't wash. If it costs the Union a
couple of high spending clubs, then so
be it; it is not unaffordable if ICU
decides it has an opinion to express.
FELIX
There will not be an issue of FELIX
next Friday (December 5th), nor on
Friday December 12th. Instead there
will be a Christmas issue on
Wednesday 10th. Hopefully this will
be an extra-large FELIX, and there
will be a staff meeting today at
12.30pm to discuss articles for this
issue. Please come along if you have
any suggestions.

Trip To The Seaside
Two delegates from IC Union
External Affairs Committee will
attend the NUS conference in
Blackpool, it was decided this week.
The delegates will act a» observers
during the conference which lasts
from the 5th to the 8th December.
Commenting on the move, Union
President Christine Taig said that
the conference would be an
invaluable source of contacts and
information on external affairs. She
pointed out that the Union would
benefit from the move in any future
debate on rejoining the NUS.
A delegate is also being sent to the
World University Service (WUS)
conference on the 16th and 17th
December. The WUS is supported
by Imperial which holds a number
of collections on its behalf. The
service provides financial help for
foreign students to study in the UK
and Europe.
Self-Defence
A specially designed self-defence
course for women is being held in
the Union Dining Hall. Twelve
students are being trained for three
weeks by special police, to be able to
defend themselves against attackers.
It is hoped that more courses will be-
run in the future.
Only Two Turn Up
Only two people turned out to
collect for Voluntary Services
Overseas last Saturday. The
collection, organised by RCSU Rag,
was cancelled due to lack of interest.
It was hoped that the collection, the
only street collection of Rag Week,
would raise in the region of £1,000.
RCSU V P , Judith Hackney,
expressed disappointment at the
lack of collectors, blaming it on the
Rag & Drag Disco which took place
on the previous evening and left
many people in bed on Saturday
morning unable to make it to
Southside for 10.00 am. There was
also some uncertainty as to the date
of the event, many people believing
the collection to have been on the
previous Saturday. Ms. Hackney
dismissed this as being the major
cause of the lack of response as
"most, if not all, of the posters had
the new dates written on them".
There is a similar stunt proposed
for next term on another VSO
licence.
Bad Teeth All Round
A 211b solid chocolate sculpture
titled "after all, chocolate is our
bread and butter" by Colin
Willroum, which was cast by
Rowntree Mackintosh pic for the

Exhibition' has been kindly donated
by Rowntree to be raffled for
charity.
Proceeds of the raffle will be used
to provide new toys for the Day

Gardens, and the Messengers Desk,
Entrance Hall, Sherfield Building,

(Health Centre) and David Price
(Safety Unit)
Tickets go on sale today, and the
draw will be made on Friday
December 19th. For further
information contact Jacqueline
Faridian or David Price.
Memorial Tree
An unusual tree was planted in
College grounds on Tuesday in
memorial of an ex-student. The tree,
a Ginkgo Biloba (maidenhair tree),
is a deciduous conifer and was
chosen due to the long history ofthe
species on this planet, fossil remains
having been found in coal measures.
The responses at the ceremony were
taken by Dr. Findlay's son. The
Doctor's wife smoothed the earth
around the tree after a speeches by a
member of the British Wood
Preservation Association. It is
hoped the tree will become an
ornament to the Imperial
environment.
No Freedom
Opposition peers will fight the
freedom of speech clause in the
Education Bill next week. They
believe that there has been too little
time for discussion fo the
amendment. This section of the Bill
would outlaw any kind of 'no
platform' policy at educational
institutions, giving any group the
right to speak on any subject at any
meeting. Staff are concerned to
know whether the Local Authority
or the educational institutes will be
responsible for the campus.
