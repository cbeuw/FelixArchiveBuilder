The St. Mary's Merger
I am asked more questions about
the proposed merger than about any
other subject; so here's a brief look
at the situation from the Union
angle.
At present talks and investi-
gations into the feasibility of the
merger are taking place. If it does
prove to be a viable proposition the
merger will not go ahead for at least
two years. The Union is heavily
involved in one official working
group, looking at the effect of the
merger on student unions and
student affairs. No major decisions
are being made by this working
group; its aims are to identify the
areas where there are likely to be
problems, with a view to finding
firm solutions during the next
academic year. At present Jackie
Peirce and I are the Union reps on
this group, but it's intended to call in
other people once we get down to
finer details. There will also be
student representation on the group
looking at the effect of the merger
on undergraduate and post-
graduate courses.
So where are the main problems
likely to occur?
The effects of the merger on
ordinary student life at Imperial are
unlikely to be very great. St. Mary's
students appear to have much more
to worry about. As a small college
with one hall of residence around
which much of the social life
revolves; they have justifiable
worries about losing their identity,
being swallowed up by a large
institution where it is no longer
possible to know everybody, at least
by sight; and losing control of
student-run facilities.
The question of identity, seen
from this end, seems a minor
problem. The fact that IC consists of
Constituent Colleges, each retaining
its own identity, and the fact that St.
Mary's is across the park at
Paddington, mean that the medical
school is likely to remain very much
a separate body within the College.
The question of facilities and
clubs is more complex. If the merger
proceeds, the St. Mary's students
will no longer be able to rely on the
goodwill of their college
administration over bars, catering
outlets, sports facilities and so on.
Steps must be taken to ensure that
those students do not lose control of
the facilities they have, for some
time, been running for themselves.
As for clubs, St. Mary's has no clubs
that IC doesn't already have. Some
of St. Mary's clubs, for instance
their renowned rugby team, will
wish to remain as separate entities;
others would probably be better to
amalgamate and pool resources.
Relevant club captains at IC and St.
Mary's will be contacted soon so
that we can identify potential
problems and sources of conflict
early on.
This brings us on to the really
thorny question—Union finance
and administration. St. Mary's
Union would have to claim to ICU
for funds as our Constituent College
unions do—this could well cause
resentment. It seems likely that in
the event of a merger the college
would guarantee a supplement to
our subvention to allow for level
funding of St. Mary's Union
(adjusted to take account of clubs
which have amalgamated), for a
period of a few years, to allow time
to sort out the problems of an
integrated finance system. This is
probably the area where most
conflicts will occur—and it will take
time to iron them out.
Other questions of Union
organisation after a merger include
the need for adequate represen-
tation of St. Mary's students within
both college and the Union;
provision for St. Mary's students to
attend Union meetings and to take
part in all activities...these are, in
theory, minor constitutional
problems easily overcome by a bit of
commonsense. What is less
straightforward is the host of
administrative problems we will face
if we are to become a fully integrated
split-site Union—problems it is
difficult to identify as yet. The
merger proposal comes at a time
when the structure and adminis-
tration of the Union is already
overburdened; it gives us yet
another reason to think seriously
about our long-term aims and how
best to achieve them.
