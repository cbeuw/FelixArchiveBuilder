More Money For
Imperial
A new venture is being set-up to
market the results of research
carried out at Imperial. The move is
expected to provide a major
financial contribution to research at
the College.
Investors In Industry pic and
Research Corporation Ltd will join*
with the College to set up a research
development company called
IMPEL (Imperial Exploitation
Ltd). IMPEL will survey the
research at Imperial for commercial
potential when it is set up in
December. It will also compile a
register of academics who wish to
act as specialist consultants and will
encourage industry to use the
College's research facilities.
Imperial currently earns £20m
each year from research work and
I M P E L will encourage more
commercial applications by seeking
out inventions and advising
researchers on patents, selling
licences and setting up new
companies. "I will be disappointed
if in three years we haven't doubled
our £20m" said Dr. David Thomas,
Director of Industrial Liason. The
investors are expected to receive
60% of the profits on their ideas,
their departments taking 20% and
College 20%, although this is
currently under review.
Union Plans
For Parties
Three working parties are being set
up to look at medium term planning
for IC Union. The scheme was put
forward by U G M and Council
Chairman Hugh Southey when the
Union Planning Group met for the
first time this year on Monday. Mr.
Southey suggested that there be
small working parties to look at
trading, building and general
organisation within the Union.
Sabbatical officers Christine Taig
and Jackie Peirce told the meeting
that the workload on the sabbaticals
and permanent staff in the Union
Office had been greatly increased
since the take over of the Snack Bar
and the Union Bar. The staffing
structure of the Union deserved
closer attention, it was explained.
Mr. Southey's proposals were
received with general agreement by
the meeting, and members of each
working party chosen from amongst
the 12 students present at the
meeting. Pete Hartley, Pete Higgs
and Hugh Southey were chosen as
chairmen of the working parties for
Trading, Building, and Organi-
sation respectively. Anyone
interested in any of the above
sections should contact the relevant
Chairman.
No Penalties
From UGC
University maths and physics
departments that lower entrance
standards will not be penalised by
the University Grants Committee.
Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,
chairman of the UGC, confirmed
this when asked to comment on a
consultative document from the
Department of Education and
Science on Teacher Supply. He
assured university departments that
they will not lose money by
dropping admission standards for
students who intend to become
teachers.
This move comes in the face of
increasing difficulty in recruiting
teachers in these subjects.
On Monday this week, the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP), organised a one-
day event at the Royal Institution to
display ideas for meeting the
shortage of teachers in maths,
physics and technology.
The CVCP joined with the
principals of polytechnics and
colleges to put on the event, which
proposed ideas for helping schools
cope with the shortage now, and
making the subjects more
interesting so that the supply of
students and graduates is increased
in the future.
Key Thieves
Raid Linstead
College Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves is appealing for information
on the series of burglaries in
Linstead Hall, following the theft
last Thursday of £2,000 of
photographic and music equipment.
Mr. Reeves is certain that the thefts
are connected with the dis-
appearance, only a year ago, of a
master key for Linstead Hall. This
key went missing during the
Summer period, when the Hall was
being used to accommodate guests
staying with the Summer
Accommodation Scheme. Since
then there have been several
incidents where rooms have been
burgled and then left locked.
The items stolen on Thursday
included three cameras, two Sony
walkmans and a compact disc
player. Mr. Reeves told FELIX that
the thieves had to have a thorough
knowledge of Linstead Hall, and are
almost certainly present or former
students or staff of the College.
Security are particularly keen to
speak to two men who were seen
leaving Linstead Hall at the time
carrying a blue holdall. One of the
men is described as 6 feet 2 inches
tall, of Indian appearance, with very
dark straggly hair, but "lacking a
beard and moustache". He was
carrying a carrier bag with a thick
yellow stripe. The other man was
about 5 feet 10 inches tall. Anyone
who saw these men should contact
Security immediately, in confidence
if necessary.
Mr. Reeves said that there* had
been at least three "sets of
incidents" since the disappearance
of the Linstead master key, and in
each case a number of bedrooms
have been entered. He is confident
that the crimes can be attributed to
the disappearance of this specific
key, since it is the only master which
also covers the Linstead extension
to have gone missing. He explained
that the master key in question had
almost certainly been stolen, rather
than simply gone missing, since it
had been removed from a
housekeeper's bunch in a locked
cabinet.
Reeves
Attacks Rag
Stunts Outside
College
Campus
Chief Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves is worried that there may be
"a serious accident" as a result of
Hit Squad type Rag Stunts which
take place outside the College
campus. Mr. Reeves' warning was
made after the incident last week
when three students wer flagged
down and 'held at gunpoint after
loading a car with toy guns outside
the Iraqi Embassy. Mr Reeves said
that because South Kensington was
a sensitive area, "anyone with any
kind of gun was going to be
s u s p i c i o u s " . This applied
particularly in the vicinity of
embassies of countries such as Iraq
where specific threats had been
made by terrorists.
Mr Reeves is hoping that there
will be an arrangement that no
stunts which involve carrying guns,
wearing balaclavas or blackening
faces, will take place outside the
College campus.
