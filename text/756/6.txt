JULIUS CAESAR: THE YOUNG
VIC
Amidst accusations of falling
standards in British Shakespeare, a
new production of Julius Caesar
arrives. This production is set in civil-
warEngland, usingaparallelbetween
England's revolution and that which
occurs in Caesar's Rome as the
reason for this setting. The effect is
not strong or contrived, the civil-war
clothes leaving for me more of a
Shakespearian-era feel to the
proceedings, enhanced by the simple
'Globe Style' ampitheatre at the
Young Vic.
Julius Caesar is known as
Shakespeare's greatpiece ofpolitical
theatre and a myriad of
interpretations have been wrought
from its intricacies. It is unclear
exactly what interpretation is
intended here, other than the old one
of the interchangibility of theatre and
politics the power of 'acting' in
controlling people.
Pick of the cast is probably Corin
Redgrave as Brutus 'the noblest
Roman of them all'. And Frank
Grimes, whose voice is weak, but
whose swagger is Roman, isperhaps a
very accurate Mark Anthony. Brutus,
after all, is the great orator, Anthony
is the one who manipulates the crowd.
Once again, one is absorbed into
his classic story ofambition, idealism
andfate. Again the brilliant intrigue
and scale of the play becomes
apparent. Though this production
does not break any drastic new
ground, it remains pleasingly
faithfidly to theplay's tradition andis
thus enjoyable Shakespeare.

Gaudete, Almeida theatre Islington.
Gaudete is a seriously brilliant
piece of theatre; unfortunately it
finished on Saturday.
The opening scene-dark bodies lie
on the stage in black plastic macs,
clothes stitched together cover all
the scenery, a bale headed minister
wakes and stumbles. This is the
darkness, the priests world inside his
schizophrenic breakdown. Clothes
representing the link between the
reality of the action just committed
and the p s y c h o t i c state.
Subsequently he is chased from far
outside his world by tenebrious
characters who whip and kill, the
priest caught between two
imaginary worlds is said to a
magical changeling.
The vica is played by two actors in
the first half, a normal vicar who
peruses cars and cameras and the
schizoid double who humps all the
local women, tries mystical charm
to get them all pregnant—"There is
going to a messiah born in this
village"—no virgin birth here, but it
seems this may be his deluded truth.
Women fall in love, refuse to
believe photgrphic evidence of
infidelity. A suicide results after a
sibling love is requited.
The vicar struggles with himself.
Normality loses, humping gets more
frenzied, local women become more
flushed wide-legged and horny.
Finally there is to a 'virgin' sacrifice
at a W.I. meeting, but the village's
men awaken.
At the meeting aphrodaisical tea
is consumed, a joint passed round as
the women wait for the vicar who
can't find his knife. The men persue
but too late, the vicar arrivew with
sacrifice just intime, murder, blood,
complete breakdown, the women lie
'naked' and drugged in the state
they are at the beginning of the play.
The vicar runs and runs,
arraigned—he is shot. At the end the
vicarage, complete with all evidence
is burnt down by the natives.
3 and a half hours seems long but
the directors Julia Bardsley
(assistant director on the
promenade production 'Road' at
the Royal Court) and Phelim
McDermott, who also act, have full
dramatic hold of their experimental
formula. They do use commonplace
images of schizophrenia but this
play started life as poem by Ted
Hughes which has other depths;this
is irrelevant to inspired drama.
Ashes: Bush Theatre at Bull andBush
Shepherds Grn
This play is grim, sordid, and as
hard as nails. The plaudits,
however, would indicate that the
revival of David Rudkins's work,
the first for ten years, is important.
Would that it were not so. Such
harsh realism as this can be
unpleasant.
The strivings of a couple
desperate to conceive forms the
play's subject matter. Its style
consists of graphic and merciless
observations on parenthood, sex
and life; humane and compas-
sionate at times, but never, ever
touching.
Dennis Lawson plays the
husband, again teaming up with
director, Rob Walker (they worked
together on the remarkable TV
series Deadhead). Sheila Fish is his
wife. The four-person cast is
excellent; the play is one of
undoubted and unrestrained power,
the effect of which totally belies the
cosy intimacy of it's Fringe venue
above a pub.
A vague background to the play is
provided by the Ulster troubles.
What sort of world is this to bring a
child into anyway?, Lawson is
wondering as he relates the gory
details of a bomb attack in which a
relative has been killed. Somehow
this is a relief compared with the
harrowing details of his wife's
pregnancy.
There is sharp humour
sometimes, but it gets blacker.
Somewhere there is optimism,
sunlight in the park, but this
departs. At the end there is nothing
but bleakness. Philosophical
mutterings inevitably turn into
nihilism and despair. Serious
students of real life may appreciate
this play. Others may find it horrific.

books
With a heavy thud like a slab of
undigested plum pudding The
Christmas Reader dropped onto my
review desk. I was considering
giving it to an Oxfam shop, but
bearing in mind most of the articles
involve over-eating and over-
drinking, that would be a bit of a
tasteless thing to do.
Godfrey Smith compiled this
book by asking readers of his Times
column to send in their favourite
passages and poems about
Christmas. The result is a
conglomeration of interesting and
inspiring bits, boring bits, and bits
that were once interesting and
inspiring, but now divorced from
their original context are a touch
dull. When you have read a story
about an American Grandma
making puddings, a French
Christmas fish dinner, Welsh roast
hare, turkeys stuffed with truffles,
then another tale about Billy Bunter
stuffing himself and ordering
servants about, one isn't
particularly interested in George
and M a r t h a Washington's
Christmas Dinner menu.
To be fair, there are some good
bits; a detective story by Arthur
Conan Doyle, where Sherlock
Holmes finds a precious stone of
great beauty and value inside the
crop of a Christmas goose. There is
also the slightly twee account of
Tiny Tim's Christmas from ' A
Christmas Carol', the carol singing
field mice in 'The Wind in the
Reviews FELIX, Friday November 28th 1986 8
Willows', the German and Allied
troops celebrating together the
Christmas truce of 1914, the birth of
Christ from Luke, poems by T.S.
Eliot, and Walter de la Mare, and
the best of all, comment from
George Bernard Shaw; ' A n
Atrocious Institution' where he
says; 'like all intelligent people, I
greatly dislike Christmas...we must
be gluttonous because it's
Christmas. We must be drunken
because it's Christmas. We must be
insincerely generous because it's
Christmas; we must buy things that
nobody wants and give them to
people we don't like...all because it's
Christmas.
The morality of consuming vast
amounts of turkey, fed on grain
imported from developing
countries, when weneed neither
turkey nor stuffing nor cranberry
jelly is something that killjoy
puritans like myself worry about.
World trade certainly—exploitation
is slightly more dodgy. How many
people in hospital after drunken
driving accidents this New Year will
feel any peace or goodwill? And will
most people be happily ensconced in
the cosy bosom of the nuclear
family, as this book implies.
By all means buy this book if you
want to—it casts £5.95 and it may
even come in handy as a Christmas
present. It's just the kind of book
we'll need when suffering
indigestion and food poisoning.

'Labyrinth' is a fairy story, a
whimsical fantasy flavoured with
pythanesque humour, sureal art and
a large dollop of David Bowie. It
tells the story of Sahra, a headstrong
teenager who finds herself whisked
into a mystical land inhabited by a
plethora of strange creatures.
To her chagrin Sahra is told that
she has only thirteen hours to solve
the enormous labyrinth before the
evil King, played by Bowie, turns
her baby brother into a goblin. She
is helped on her quest by a cuddly
gnome and rather cute eight foot tall
yeti with a persucution complex and
a voice like Bob Dylan.
The sickeningly pretty Jennifer
Connelly plays Sahra in a style
which parodies Julie Garlands
performance in the Wizard of Oz.
As ever Mr. Bowie, manages to
appear suave and sophisticated in
spite of looking like something from
the cover of a science fiction book.
The musical numbers written and
performed by Bowie seem tofitin
with the fabric of the film but taken
out of context they can only be
described as weak and watery.
The puppetry work is excellent, as
one would expect from Jim Henson,
director of the "Dark Crystal", and
to a large extent it masks, what is at
heart a one dimensional story line.
Still, the film has some nice
touches and contains all the
ingredients to ensure that it will be a
mega Christmas hit.
'Round Midnight' takes its name
from Thelonious Monk compos-
ition and, in case that doesn't give
any clues, concerns jazz. It
particularly concerns a jazz
saxophonist, a fictional Dale
Turner, played by the very real
Dexter Gordon. The film is based
on the relationship between Bud
Powell and Francis Paudras and it
portrays the way in which the
French graphic artist saves the great
jazz musician from his self
destructive influences and gets him
back composing again. This is not a
wholly altruistic act on behalf of
Francis, Francois Cluzet, as he finds
great inspiration through the music,
in fact much more than through his
former wife, much to her
understandable regret.
The story documents the life of
the musician through a series of
claustrophic hotel rooms and jazz
clubs and skillfully framed close-ups
whose oppressiveness is not really
apparent until there is a dramatic
change of scene to the seaside which
comes as a breath of fresh air so
strong you can almost smell it.
Dexter Gordon paints a very
convincing portrait of his character,
so believable in fact that you
suspect, with some justification, that
he is merely reliving some moments
of his own life. In spite of this
impressive performance the
screenplay itself does not really
provide enough insight into the
motives of Mr Gordon, particularly
reasons for his self destructive
behaviour, and for this reason the
film, in spite of its inforced intimacy,
has a remote feeling a certain
detachment that prevents real
involvement. It is nevertheless a
rather lovely film that brings a smile
to the lips with every note that drips
from the sweet saxophone. Sigh.
I suppose it's a reflection on the
average cinema-goer, but
screenwriters seem to be getting
younger and younger (no it's not
merely a rapid ageing in the reviewer
that forces him to comment on the
youth of the police force, it's an
unrelated phenomenon, an absolute
rather than relative observation). So
it is with 'Critters' a film that owes
not a little to 'Gremlins' and which
was written when the author was
still at college. In this case the origin
of the Krites/Critters is not some
oriental curiosity shop but another
planet, they are in fact criminals
with voracious appetites, eating
everything that moves.
It is a fairly predictable story
involving a mid-Western nuclear
family, a local crazy that no-one
pays attention to, an overnight
sheriff, screaming roles for women
and an inventive child (male). But
within this formula there are some
nice uses of subtitles for the critics
and some imaginative editing and a
wonderful scene where a Krite eats
an ET doll after failing to engage it
in conversation. Quite fun, in a
puerile sort of way, but not an
absolute must.
Nor unfortunately is 'Psycho IIP
though it does come fairly close. It
was directed by it's star Anthony
Perkins because he felt no-one else
would do justice to the Norman
Bates character that has virtually
become his life's work.
It is difficult to say much about
the plot without giving too much
away but basically it continues off
where 'Psycho IP left off and it
makes several references to both
predecessors. Though a knowledge
of the second 'Psycho' is probably
not necessary, a large number of the
jokes would probably be missed if
you haven't seen the first one. In fact
it is in the use of humour that Mr
Perkins shows a fine understanding
of the work of Hitchcock, for
example the modern leniency in film
allows him to show a scene that
Hitchcock would have enjoyed, a
murder whilst someone is using the
toilet. A flavour of the film is given
by Norman Bates' reply to an
apology of one of his guests about
leaving the bathroom in a state, 'I've
seen it worse'.
Finally and very briefly is an
immensely silly, but entertaining
film from John Carpenter, who
certainly knows how to make action
films, 'Big Trouble in Little China'.
Kurt Russell, doing his best John
Wayne accent, is a truck driver who
runs across an ancient Chinese who
requires a green-eyed bride (I told
you it was silly). It's all good wet-
afternoon escapist stuff, leave your
cynicism and prejudices at home
and enjoy.
See you all at the movies!
