Ice-cream and
sunshine
T
he other day I was sitting
in my room doing some
necessary Biology work
when I heard the sound
– THE sound. And sud-
denly, I knew; the harsh, cold tyranny
of winter is over. That sound of loud,
tin-ny chimes playing a barely rec-
ognisable version of “Greensleeves”
and kids on the estate yelling, in their
South London accents, “ICEEEEE
CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM!” and “Get
yo money den dat’s da ice cream truck!”,
alongside the sounds of doors slam-
ming and kids running. And I admit, I
felt a pang of craving for ice-cream too
but at the same time I am 21, and like
most middle-class white chicks, I’m
still a little bit scared of those kids who
have grown up on a council estate in
South-east London with parents who
look like crystal meth addicts, I mean,
don’t they all have guns and knives and
shit? That’s what The Daily Mail says
anyway.
As soon as summer hits you have to
adjust your iPod playlists for the change
in weather and stop listening to all that
music from the winter because it’s not
fresh any more. One of the things I’ve
been listening to is dance music with
horns that sound like Mark Ronson
putting on a summer carnival rave in
SE1. Mr Miyagi is a Swedish duo of
“one rock musician and one computer
geek” according to their Myspace and
their song “We Gonna Give You the
Lesson” will make you wanna dance
like it’s Brazil and everyone is only
wearing glittery thongs and feath-
ered head-dresses. Crookers, who you
might remember from that remix of
Kid Cudi’s “Day ‘n’ night” (I predicted
that would be big in my January article,
you read it here first!) has also got in on
the brass section action with “Gypsy P”
which sounds like a song you could
dance to around a campfire, drinking
psychadelic tea with Gogol Bordello.
But my favourite horn-related song
of right now has to be Jesse Rose’s
“Touch My Horn” [Mad Kids remix],
a perfect blend of anthemic brass and
techno breaks – the perfect summer
dance-track. Moving away from dance
music, I’ve also been listening to the
song “Obsessions” by Marina & the
Diamonds approximately twenty times
a day, every day for the past two weeks.
It’s just that good. It’s so beautiful it al-
most makes me cry. However no one in
the felix office seems quite as into this
as I am, so my enthusiasm might just
be because I am an unashamedly mas-
sive Kate Bush fan and she sounds like
a cross between Kate Bush, Florence &
the Machine, and La Roux.
My other summer staple is always,
hip-hop remixes. I mean the kind of
hip-hop that reminds you of the Fresh
Prince of Bel Air. Last year it was Kid
Sister with lyrics like “help your granny
up out of her chair/if you wanna get
loose say ‘hell yeah’ ” this year I don’t
know what it’s gonna be. I’ve heard Rye
Rye aka the new M.I.A. but I’m not
sure she’s got what it takes. Also her
Myspace has the worst design of all
time, but I’m not sure if it’s just sup-
posed to be “retro” or something.

F
ounded by Chris Goss and
Tony Colman (also known as
London Elektricity) in early
1996 in their west London
studio, Hospital Records was
set up primarily to spread their own
music within the drum and bass scene.
Since then, it’s grown to become one of
the biggest drum and bass labels in the
world, known for leaning towards liq-
uid funk, a more melodic subgenre of
drum and bass, with nearly 300 releas-
es as well as being home to some of the
most popular drum and bass produc-
ers, like High Contrast and Nu:Tone.
Hospitality,thelabel’sownclubnight,
began in 1996 at Herbal in Shoreditch
but quickly spread out of London to
Cardiff, Brighton and even Berlin.
Hospitality soon outgrew its London
venue and moved to a hugely success-
ful quarterly residency at Heaven.
At the end of September 2008, Heav-
en was sold by its previous owners and
the new owners decided in November
– with just two weeks to go before the
gig – to cancel the last Hospitality of
2008. Even with the threat of legal ac-
tion, no agreement was reached be-
tween Heaven and Hospitality to re-
solve the situation.
This led Hospital Records to make
the move to London’s brand new Mat-
ter at the O2 Arena. Founded by the
owners of Fabric, Cameron Leslie and
Keith Reilly, the 2,600 capacity venue
can only be described as incredible.
The whole place is completely immer-
sive. Capable of generating stiff breeze,
no words could adequately describe
the clarity and quality of the phenome-
nal 200 speaker sound system in Room
One, and if you thought the BodySonic
dance floor in Fabric’s Room One vi-
brated a lot, you have got to experience
the latest incarnation, the BodyKinetic
dance floor, at Matter. Along with your
hair and clothes moving in the air, kick
drums pounding in your chest and
your whole body vibrating from the
floor, you’ll see some top-class VJing
projected onto all of the walls.
The whole experience makes eve-
ry pretentious West-end club (e.g.
Maya, come on RCSU…) seem like a
crap house party where all the tracks
are streamed from YouTube and
played back on a knackered iPod dock
bought in the closing-down sale at
Woolworths.
However, you can have the best club
environment in the world but with-
out great DJs it’ll fall flat on its face.
Hospital Records haven’t let us down
here either. Room One kicked off with
Nu:Tone and Logistics for the first
two hours who warmed up the slightly
sparse crowd nicely with their smooth
flowing, minimal mixes.
Starting his hour-and-a-half set with
some impressive turn-tablism, Brazil-
ian DJ Marky took it up a notch and
the dancefloor was soon heaving. Nor-
mally, I find scratching to be irritating
and narcissistic because often it doesn’t
add anything whatsoever to the music,
but here Marky skillfully integrated it
unobtrusively and intricately into the
mix.
National Drum and Bass 2009 award
winner (Best Liquid DJ) High Contrast
followed with his trademark uplift-
ing sets, although after DJ Marky he
seemed a little predictable.
London Elektricity hit the stage at
2:30am. He played a great set with
tracks from Mistabishi’s new album
Drop – ‘Printer Jam’ in particular sent
the crowd wild – and dubplates from
new artists recently signed to Hospital
such as B-Complex and Sigma. Howev-
er, the set wasn’t perfect. TC’s ‘Where’s
My Money’ virtually stopped the dance
floor and even got a few boos from the
crowd, prompting London Elektricity
to make a quick record change about
15 seconds into the track.
Cyantific then showed off some of his
technical skills, playing three records
at once and his more techy sound was
a welcome change to the last two-and
-a-half hours of liquid funk.
Room Two was dedicated entirely
to dubstep all night. Although much
smaller than Room One, it is well
suited, both acoustically and atmos-
pherically, to the darker side of elec-
tronica. Rinse FM radio presenter N-
Type played a mind-blowing set with
some really great tracks that kept the
mix interesting, rather than the usual
two-step garage beats and wobbling
sub-bass.
After last year’s release of his amazing
debut album Diary Of An Afro Warrior,
I was particularly excited about seeing
Benga DJ at Hospitality, but he turned
out to be a complete disappointment.
After turning up 40 minutes late, he
then proceeded to invite so many of
his mates into the booth that he could
barely move to get to his record bag
and spent so much of his time chat-
ting to his friends that the mix was all
over the place. Silence ensued after he
seemed to forget completely where he
was and let the Skream remix of La
Roux’s ‘Going In For The Kill’ play to
the very end of the record. The look
on his face when he realised what had
just happened was priceless. He also
seemed to constantly mash his hand
into the beat repeat button at every
opportunity. Did he just want us to go
back into Room One so he could catch
up with his friends? The MCs were aw-
ful, one of whom seemed to only be
able to make squealing monkey noises.
Benga may be a great producer, but
he’s a terrible DJ.
Back in Room One, Bristol’s Krust
and Die rounded off what was, with
the exception of Benga, an extraordi-
nary night. Hospitality will be back at
Matter on 1st May with High Contrast,
Fabio, London Elektricity, Friction,
Cyantific, Danny Byrd, Skream and
DJ Zinc. I’ll definitely be going, and I
think you should too.
Brazilian DJ Marky hits the mark with his renowned scratching and mixing skills
Don’t be put off by the name, despite
sounding like a Japanese cartoon show
these pocket monsters have produced
a diamond of an album which sparkles
in the Rough Trade catalogue. Hailing
from London, the 21 year-old Mica
Levi a.k.a. Micachu, along with Marc
Pell and Raisa Khan (The Shapes) are
a spit-ball in the face of the indie es-
tablishment. They have produced a
collection of twisted three minute pop
songs, a nicotine fuelled, manic ciggy
rush and the perfect antidote to the in-
sipid wave of morbid rock produced by
the White Lies – just what the doctor
ordered for 2009.
A graduate from Guildhall Music
School, Mica has already written a
score for the London Philharmonic
Orchestra as part of a young compos-
ers project and releasing her own grime
mix tapes ‘Filthy Friends’. The debut al-
bum Jewellery is released off the back
of an NME Awards show appearance
and precludes extensive touring across
the UK, US and Europe.
In constant decay, Jewellery skims
the edge of sanity, knitting together a
loose alliance of influences from low-fi
to dubstep to hip-hop busting to break
loose. Abrasive from the start ‘Vulture’
erupts with the energy of the Libertines
setting the tone for a relentless assault
of out-of-tune guitars and distorted
samples mastered with the quirky in-
genuity of a young Beck.
Threaded through with prickly lyr-
ics, from the bitter “lie all the time you
still get by”, “I was told I have a sell by
date” to the direct “she stole all my
money, the f---ing thief” backed with
shouts, crushed and perverted sounds
Mica builds up a monument of burnt
nerves, pent-up anger and young lust
in modern London.
The infectious ‘Curly Teeth’ em-
ploys an R&B section so catchy one
could imagine Missy Elliot sliding into
view then taking forward electro-pop,
‘Golden Phone’ sounds like a grimy
Hot Chip track and ‘Just In Case’ sees
Lily Allen meet Bjork in her Homog-
enic days with a fierce low-fi
accompaniment.
This album owes alot to
hours spent on sampling
software and harnesses
a diverse array of sounds
that would make the Flam-
ing Lips proud. This is best
exemplified by ‘Turn Me
Well’ which boasts a vacuum
cleaner in its ensemble – art is
life, life is art.
In the end, this a debut album
with an irrepressible punk
sensibility and it will
be interesting to
see where Mi-
cachu will take
her sound next.
However ques-
tions of the fu-
ture are out of
joint with the
album’s out-
look, so for the
moment seize
the day and
enjoy this of-
fering of raw,
painful youth.
