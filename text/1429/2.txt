What do you get if you pair a scientist
with a designer? Designers shape the
way we live while scientists pervade
the very fabric of our lives.
Inspiredbythesuccessesoftherecent
Fabrics of Life project, Nobel Textiles,
which married together five Medical
Research Council Nobel prize-winners
with five leading Textile and Fashion
Fellows from Central Saint Martins
College of Art & Design in London,
the Nobelini scheme invites 30 young
scientist-designer pairs to compete
for £2000 to develop designs that cel-
ebrate discovery across four scientific
themes: stem cells; energy and recy-
cling; synthetic and systems biology;
and imaging.
Are you are a science student, PhD
or postdoctoral researcher whose
interests fall into one of the above
themes? This scheme offers you the
Win £2000 to develop your
science-inspired design
chance to engage directly with a crea-
tive practitioner to brainstorm ways
of translating scientific principles into
design models. Perhaps you are a de-
sign student or a practitioner setting
up your own business? Nobelini offers
you the chance to engage directly with
a scientist in the development of a de-
sign proposal that celebrates scientific
discovery.
Participants will pair-up 30 young
scientists with 30 design students at a
speed-dating style event at the Science
Museum’s Dana Centre on Tuesday
26th May 2009. If you’d like to be con-
sidered for the Nobelini scheme, apply
as follows.

Evelyn Gardens stuck in the
dark ages after explosion
A number of students living in Evelyn
Gardens were left without any water,
electricity or heating on Monday night
after an electrical cable cracked under
the pavement outside Holbein Hall.
Atroughly01:30thecrackcausedtwo
fuses and one circuit breaker to trip in
the sub-station that serves the Evelyn
Garden area, which caused the sudden
loss of power in all rooms situated in
Willis Jackson, Holbein, Southwell and
Fisher, however the emergency lights
came on immediately afterward.
Philip Notely, Village Manager for
the Evelyn Gardens areas, told felix
that “The power failure resulted in all
lights, electrical sockets, telephone, in-
ternet and water circulation pumps and
heating to fail. The emergency lighting
automatically came on in corridors
and staircases. At 10.00am on Monday
16th EDF reinstated the power to the
buildings.”
Many students were oblivious about
the whole incident as they were asleep,
with the majority realising the lack of
power and water in the morning. One
of the residents in Southwell Halls told
felix that “I was very confused when I
got up in the morning and tried to turn
the light on. I then went to the kitchen
to get a drink of water where there was
a sign on the door saying that every-
thing wasn’t working.”
In order to repair the damage that
the incident caused, EDF had to dis-
connect power to Southwell and Hol-
bein Halls from 13:00 on Monday, but
power was finally reinstated to all af-
fected areas by 22:00.
The Estates department, realising
that these premises might have been
without any power, came up with a
back-up solution. “In the early evening
Estates provided a generator as back
up in case EDF could not reinstate the
power on Monday evening.” said Mr
Notley.
He then went on to say that: “Dur-
ing this time students affected were di-
rected to Common Rooms within the
halls that had power. When students
returned from College between 17:00
and 18:00 the Wardens briefed them
on the situation. Students were given
food vouchers which they could use in
the library. Bottled water was available
for students.”

“Hall staff and Wardens worked
closely with Facilities Management
dealing with students queries and en-
suring that they were kept updated at
all times. Notices were fixed around all
Halls advising students of the current
situation.”
As a result of all the work carried
out to rectify the problem, the pave-
ment area outside Holbein Hall had to
be removed, however since then EDF
have returned and everything is back
to normal.

The results of this year’s Sabbatical
elections were announced on Wednes-
day amidst a packed crowd in da
Vinci’s. where around 3,500 students
voted to determine who would be run-
ning the Union next year. Initially the
results were meant to be announced
on Thursday night, but Returning Of-
ficer Christian Carter decided to move
the date forward after all candidates
agreed to have it earlier.
Mr Carter decided to released the re-
sults in reverse order, according to the
number of votes casted. Starting with
the Student Trustees, Mark Mearing-
Smith was elected in the first round.
Mr Mearing-Smith is joined by Es-
ther Khan who won in the 5th round,
Amaury Fastenakel who won in the 3rd
round and Shah Rahman who won in
the 6th round.
Next up were the results for Deputy
President (Welfare) where John James
proved that second time’s a charm, as
he beat Caroline Clark by 312 votes
and Michael Powell who came in third
with 501 votes. Clearly Mr James’ en-
ergetic speeches worked where he
promised to fight the increase in ac-
commodation costs next year. A total
of 1,957 people voted, only 188 more
than last year.
Next up was the other newly formed
position of Deputy President (Educa-
tion) where Jonathan Silver came out
victorious in the second round against
Alex Grisman with Matthew Kaufeler
falling in the first round along with
RON. A massive 2,046 people voted,
which was 277 more than the year be-
fore where it was a combined position
for education and welfare.
The Knit-Soc queen and Social Clubs
Committee chair, Jennifer Wilson,
was named the new Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) after she managed
to stave-off the Athletics Club Com-
mittee candidate Colette Gregory, win-
ning in the first round by 1,214 votes
to 846.
Currently there are several Glaxo-
SmithKline employees in an internal
course that teaches them the funda-
mentals of lab chemistry. This course
has been running for years and is based
around teaching employees from non-
lab-specific backgrounds how to work
in a chemistry pharmaceutical compa-
ny. For the most part these employees
have doctorates and multiple degrees
and are on what is essentially a chem-
istry conversion course run by GSK.
This course has been run routinely all
over the world, in a standardized form
and has proved to be quite successful
for GSK, who decided to try and turn it
into a more substantial qualification.
GSK, via the Royal Society of Chem-
istry, then asked Imperial College to
accredit the course by acting as an ex-
ternal examiner and then putting the
Imperial College brand on the course.
But as the Chemistry department ex-
amined the content of the course they
came to the opinion that what GSK
were teaching their staff was extremely
close to being a masters degree and de-
cided that after some minor changes
they could issue the GSK employees
with Imperial College masters’ diplo-
mas – in return for cash.
On Wednesday 17th Professor Tom
Welton presented an application to the
Graduate School of Engineering and
Physical Sciences Quality Commit-
tee to create a new programme called
“Professional Development (GSK
Pharmaceutical Process Chemistry)”
which would essentially make Imperial
College act as a moderating body for
the internal GSK programme, provided
the course met certain conditions. The
intention of this paper, as explained by
the head of the chemistry department,
was to pave the way for the creation of
a new programme whereby GSK em-
ployees would be able to earn an Impe-
rial College Masters degree for a course
that would be taught, designed and
examined by GSK but modified and
moderated by the College to ensure
quality standards are met. Should this
programme prove successful, the next
step would be to sell the new masters
package to other pharmaceutical com-
panies, specifically Merck and Proctor
and Gamble.
If the College decides to go ahead
and allow the new masters course to be
made, it would be the first university
to have sold a course and degree, as a
product, to a company.
After the talks on Wednesday the
committee is currently drawing up
conditions that the GSK course and
employees must meet for Imperial to
accredit and moderate the internal
course; in principle the committee is
happy to proceed provided that the
people who take the course have 2.1
degrees (most, in fact, have signifi-
cantly better qualifications), that they
are taught to Imperial standard (by
GSK staff), that the course is of a high
enough quality (determined by the
Chemistry Department and externally
moderated) and that the participants
are examined properly (the specifics
have yet to be confirmed).
When the student representative
raised points about ensuring that the
value of students’ degrees were not
harmed by the sale of degrees to pri-
vate interests the committee agreed
that this could be the beginning of a
slippery slope and that the participat-
ing firms would have to be carefully
selected. As one committee mem-
ber put it “we wouldn’t do this with
Woolworths”
For students, this could prove to be
either good or bad news. If Imperial
were to start outsourcing its degree
teaching it could forge an extremely
strong strategic position within the
private sector as an industry standard,
but if mismanaged it could massively
devalue degrees, only time can tell.
But this reporter would like to recom-
mend that if, years from now, we need
to pick a definitive date that Imperial
started “selling out” it should be the
17th March 2009.
In the race for Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services) the Royal School of
Mines boy Danny Hill was up against
Recreational Clubs Committee chair
Peter Mabbott. At the final count,
Danny Hill had 1,148 votes compared
to Peter Mabbott’s 850, meaning that
Danny Hill will be taking control of the
Union’s budget next year.
Surprisingly, the position of Union
President didn’t attract the highest
voting attendance, which has normally
been the case in the past. This could
be due to the fact that there was only
one candidate running for the position,
however, the RON candidate managed
to put up a good fight. In the end, Ash-
ley Brown was named the new Impe-
rial College union President, winning
the race with a 1,572 votes compared
to 763 votes for RON.
In a rather surprising turn, it was in-
deed the position for Felix Editor that
attracted the highest turn-out at 2,646
votes, which roughly equates to 25% of
the electoral body at Imperial. In the
first round, Zoë Dobell and RON were
eliminated leaving this year’s Deputy
Editor and News Editor to fight it out
to the bitter end. As has been the pat-
tern over the past few years, the po-
sition for Felix Editor was a fiercely
fought one, with only 65 votes in it.
This very slim victory margin ended
up favouring Dan Wan, who will be the
new editor as Felix enters its 60th year.
The close margin for Felix Editor has
been a familiar sight in recent years,
with this year’s editor, Jovan Nedić,
winning by only 78 votes against Greg
Mead last year. Tom Roberts, who was
recently named Guardian Media Stu-
dent Journalist of the Year, only won
his election against Emily Lines by 49
votes back in 2007.
This record-breaking turnout for
Sabbatical elections shows how seri-
ously the candidates have been taking
the elections, which can only be a posi-
tive outcome for student democracy.
felix would like to take this opportu-
nity to congratulate everyone that won
and wishes them the best of luck. Trust
me, you’re going to need it.
