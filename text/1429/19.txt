How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Crossing the Lake
There are four people in an adven-
ture race that need to get across
a lake. They have a small canoe.
The rules say that only the slow-
est person in the canoe can pad-
dle, only one or two can be in the
canoe at a time, and they must all
cross in the canoe. From practice,
they know that:
Mike can paddle across in 1 minute.
Bill can paddle across in 2 minutes.
Sue can paddle across in 5
minutes.
Anne can paddle across in 10
minutes.
How do they get everyone across
the river in the fastest time without
breaking the rules?

the University of Glasgow in their
semi-final. Both sides were clearly
tired at this point with Imperial giving
away points due to fatigue and service
mistakes, however, Imperial managed
to win the match 3-0 and became the
BUCS Men’s Trophy Champions.
Women’s Volleyball
The women’s team, unfortunately,
couldn’t repeat the performance of
the men’s team, however they put up a
great fight. On the first day they played
Dundee, who were one of the champi-
onship favourites, and although they
played hard, they eventually lost 2-0.
As a result, it meant that on Saturday
they had to win both games to qualify
for the semi-finals.
Their first match that day was against
Birmingham at 9am and with some
great play they managed to win the
game 2-1. Manchester were the next
team the girls had to face, and with sets
being decided by only a few points they
were unlucky to lose the game 2-0. In
their final match of the tournament,
the women’s volleyball team were up
against Durham for 5th place, however
luck was not on their side and although
the match went to three sets, the final
one went Durham’s way at 17-15. Cap-
tain Alana Johnson commented on
the girls performance saying that “The
girls have done extremely well this sea-
son, after only being promoted to the
first division this year, to qualify for the
final 8’s was a great achievement.”
Women’s Fencing
In other sports, having scraped a win
against Cambridge in the quarter-finals
the women’s fencing team were head-
ing to Sheffield for the BUCS cham-
pionships. In the semi-finals the team
were facing Birmingham. The Imperial
epee team consisting of team captain
Emily Bottle, Hannah Bryars and Joan
Chang, did a fantastic job of keeping
the match close throughout and limit-
ed what could have been a significantly
Monumental achievement
for Imperial sports with a
record turnout at BUCS
Championships
Continued from back page worse loss to 2 hits.
Despite everything the foil team
maintained their lead to win the foil.
Unfortunately with two extremely
strong foilists (including one due to
go to the world championships in a
few weeks) in the Oxford team, the
foil team lost the 30-45. The sabre fol-
lowed, with an unchanged team from
the semi-final. Again the sabre went
without any problems winning 45-27.
The Oxford team took the epee 45-
40 giving them an overall lead of two
hits 117-115. Despite the frustration of
having come so close in the final, this
was a fantastic end to the season which
saw the Imperial women’s team lose
to only one team throughout the year
and gain the silver medals in the team
championship.
Men’s Table Tennis
In the men’s table tennis trophy
competition, after defeating Plymouth,
Bournemouth, Cardiff and Glamor-
gan in some closely fought knockout
matches, Imperial’s men’s tennis team
qualified into the final of the national
trophy competition. The final was very
close with Imperial successfully beat-
ing the University of York resulting
in a gripping 9-7 win. In addition to
this fantastic win, Imperial’s Eddie Liu
was then awarded with ‘Player of the
tournament’.
Men’s Judo
Eugene Weiming Siew and Rahual
Bose from the Imperial Judo club man-
aged to come away with a silver and a
bronze medal. In the men’s “Dan” grade
section under 100kg, Eugene Weiming
Siew came away with the silver medal,
whilst Rahual Bose came away with the
bronze in the under 73kg category.
Indoor Athletics
On the Friday, athletes from the IC
& ICSM Athletics clubs travelled up
to Sheffield to compete in the pres-
tigious BUCS Indoors Athletics event.
The pressure was high to perform well
against the fierce competition, but eve-
ryone was ready to put forward their
best efforts following weeks of prepa-
ration and training.
James Teuten and Sam O’Neill both
ran in the days opening event, the
1500m. Ajay Mohite started off his
Athletics season very well, jumping an
impressive 13.08m in the triple jump,
and subsequently qualifiying for the
final. Tom Brown ran an excellent
3000m heat amongst stiff competition.
In a later heat Alex Milne also ran the
3000m, coping well with a very diffi-
cult heat in which the leaders stormed
off at the start. Alex still ran a strong
race in 9 minutes and 42 seconds.
Pavidra Sivanandarajah also ran
the 60m achieving her PB and closely
missed semi-final qualification in both
this event and the 200metres. Her ded-
icated training regime clearly paid off.
Aaron Mason ran a spectacular
400metre race, showing off a clearly
well practiced technique and admira-
ble endurance. This was also demon-
strated in the 200m where he narrowly
scraped qualification.
Other Sports
Imperial’s snooker club took away
the bronze whilst the highest break
for the championships went to Impe-
rial’s Sam Groth. The swimmers also
achieved success with a silver medal in
the women’s 100m freestyle
Neil Mosley, Head of Sport Impe-
rial, told felix that “This was our best
ever performance in BUCS with some
incredible team and individual per-
formances from all who qualified.
There was an unexpected highlight for
me at Sheffield though... Men’s Table
Tennis... not a sport that we have had
much success at before, and not a club
that has had much support from Sport
Imperial,they are self coached and very
much student run...to qualify for Shef-
field they had to travel away to a range
of universities including Plymouth and
Bournemouth and face two very tough
fixtures at home versus Glamorgan
and Cardiff.”
“Their final against York was in-
credibly exciting...the standard of ta-
ble tennis was breathtaking and the
York number 1 player was completely
unbeatable at a higher level... but the
performances of Eddie Liu (who won
player of the tournament), Yang Zhang,
BerndKleinwachterandcaptainDarius
Atashroo, who all consistently raised
their game to prevail 9-7, were simply
breathtaking and they were rightly de-
lighted to win the Trophy.”
“Overall, I was immensely pleased
and proud of our performances and the
way that the teams competed with the
very best.We have truly raised the bar
now and taken sport to a higher level.
The championships were very profes-
sionally run and I also think that BUCS
has finally arrived too!!”
Lastly, this reporter would like to
congratulate everyone who was in-
volved over the weekend, as well as

mation to make that fills the report.
