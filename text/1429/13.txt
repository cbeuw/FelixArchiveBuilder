Nightlife Editor – Catherine Jones (CJ)
Sun, sex, drugs and dance music
As summer is just around the corner, Catherine Jones previews nightlife highlights not to be missed
T
he sun has finally come
out and made its happy
presence known. Hopeful-
ly you’ve made the most of
it, with the fairer amongst
you possibly even suffering from your
first batch of sunburn.
Summer will be along soon and we
have to look forward to the best nights
out, in the almost fresh air of London.
Here are a selection of events with
the minimum amount of hassle, any-
one can enjoy;
Get Loaded in The Park.
Bank Holiday Sunday 30th August
Get Loaded in The Park returns to
Clapham Common for the Bank Holi-
day Sunday! No camping, no mud, no
long motorway journey to reach the
campsite. You can even catch the last
tube home. This year’s Headliners are
Orbital, with the iconic duo Paul and
Phil Hartnoll celebrating the 20th an-
niversary of the release of their first
single “Chime”, considered by some to
be one of the best dance records of all
time.
“We’ve got 15 years of active service,
making songs,” says Paul. “If you boil
that down to a 90-minute festival set
you should get something thoroughly
good from beginning to end. Let’s put
some fun back into it.” With their trade
mark torch glasses and innovative vid-
eo visuals, you know it will be one to
remember.
