Where do you get your fashion in-
spirations from?
Hmm. Inspiration originated in the cloth-
ing we see on the runways.Then, with that
in mind, I can be inspired by cinema, por-
traits, artists, famous personalities. I had seen a great
exhibition of Carlo Mollino, a very gifted Italian de-
signer. I saw pictures of him and was inspired by his
personal style.

its “More Dash than Cash”

spreads featured heavy tribal
and safari influence with ac-
cessories and clothing ranging

Barbie Gets Botox
Barbie celebrated her 50th
birthday on the 9th March.
Mattel unveiled a new face
for Barbie based on Christina
Aguilera. The new Barbie
wears an updated two-piece
version of the black and
white bathing suit the debut
Barbie wore in 1959. Mattel
sold the new doll at $3 during
Barbie’s birthday week – the
original cost of a Barbie doll
in 1959. More than 50 design-
ers, including Marchesa and
Vera Wang drafted new outfits
to celebrate Barbie’s gold
anniversary. Karl Lagerfeld’s
design is available at the
Colette in Paris as “Barbie and
Ken” exhibition from now until
the 28th March.
Fashion and Music
The most played track in the
SS09 fashion shows is The
Great DJ by The Tings Tings.
And the cliche of the cliche
goes to Stella McCartney for
playing her dad’s song. Check
out all the tracks played on the
runways in New York, London
and Milan at http://tinyurl.

SHIT
Kawai Wong met the fashion director for the New York Times Style Magazine, Bruce Pask in Dover Street
Market. She asked Bruce a few questions.
Spring is all about springing

some spring inspirations.

Noten.

Three most stylish men of all time?
There are stylish people I admire. Paul
Newman, Steve McQueen, Alain
Delon are a few.

Three most inspiring cities?
I love Tokyo. I did a shoot there at the end of last
year and I was incredibly inspired by all the street
style. Their outfits are so carefully considered.
The shopping is outrageous, they have some
of the most amazing shops in the world. I love Lon-
don. We Americans are style-obsessed by the Eng-
lish.Your history, your street style. And NYC of
course. For the originality, the audacity, the
creativity, and the beauty.

Last three songs played on your iPod?
I only listen to my iPod when I travel on
airplanes, usually trying to go to sleep. I
love Sigur Ros and their beautiful songs.
They really calm me. So the last three
songs have certainly been by them, and the Icelan-
dic titles are indecipherable to me!
2
Three favourite publications?
T Magazine, of course. The New York Times
Style Magazine. Fntastic Man. My friend
Charlie Porter is an editor there. The third
is a tie between Numero Homme. Serge Gir-
ardi is a great fashion editor there. Arena Homme Plus,
and Another Man.I’m a big fan of Nicola Formichetti’s
styling.

What brought you to London this time?
I took the Eurostar to London for the week-
end after I finished shooting a still life fashion
story for an upcoming New York Times Maga-
zine in Paris.
I hadn’t been to London in a while and just wanted to
run around stores, museums, restaurants, and theaters.

Three favourite places in London?
Dover Street Market of course. But that’s quite obvious. I
love Rose Bakery and the Labour and Wait stand there.
Which leads me to the next: the Labour and Wait store on
Cheshire Street off Brick Lane.
I like the White Cube Gallery on Hoxton Square and I love the Tate
Modern. I love eating at the Wolseley. Richard James, my favorite
Savile Row designer took me there for dinner when it opened
a few years back. And for going out I have a great time at the
Joiner’s Arms. Always a fun crowd.

Three timeless
items a man must
own?
Facts abouts Bruce:
1. He has been the fashion director for T Mag-
azine since March 2006.
2. He was the style director for a Conde Nast’s
publication - Cargo - before joining the New
York Times.
3. He freelanced for Vanity Fair, The
Sopranos.
4. T: The New York Times Style Magazine is
similar to the Style Magazine of the Sunday
Times in the UK. T circulates inside The Sunday
New York Times across America.
Bruce’s latest project in T can be found here:

Just a note!
The Gloucester Road Oxfam shop routinely re-
ceives donations from Gucci (women) and Empo-
rio Armani (men). According to the shop keeper,
James, the clothing items are “returned goods”
to the luxury stores as they are slightly daman-
ged (e.g. a sloppy button). Upon examination,
these items are still in extremely good condition.
Whether or not these are in season, we do not
know. But all these pieces are on the rail in the
Oxfam shop for £125. James once saw an original
price tag on an Armani coat - £3000 - therefore
a whopping 95% discount! Hardly anything skint
students can afford, but definitely worth a men-
tion! - Kawai
