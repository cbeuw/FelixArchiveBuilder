The Immortals hit
Imperial College
The Imperial Immortals have been
hard at work over the winter months
and now their first game is just around
the corner. For those of you who don’t
know, The Immortals are Imperial
College’s very own American Football
Team. The Club was founded in Octo-
ber 2008 and since then we have grown
from a small group of enthusiasts to a
unit of 30 chiselled athletes.
Life for the club started out with
kit less sessions in the mud across
the road in Hyde Park. After negotia-
tions between our Head Coach Matt
Excell and Coach Franco of the Lon-
don Cobras (a top professional team
in England) we have been having full
contact workouts twice a week over at
their Selhurst training facility, with ad-
ditional white board classes to discuss
tactics, and time in the weights room
to further enhance our physique.
To be eligible to play in the BUAF
League we have to host one home
fixture. This will be taking place this
coming Sunday against the London
Cobras down at Harlington (KO 1pm).
We hope that you can come down and
support the mighty Imperial Immor-
tals. Cheerleaders are required! If you
cannot make it but are keen on getting
involved over the summer and next
year please send an email to american.
football@imperial.ac.uk
Finally a big thank you has to go out
to Mac, Jan and Coach Excell for get-
ting the ball rolling and also for the
time and effort put in over the year
from Stan, Tom and Rich.
George Barnes
Imperial overcome Oxford
and dances itself to 2nd place
Cambridge comes first, Oxford second
and Imperial... third – that’s how the
core of the current Imperial College
Dance Team grew up in the university
dance circuit. After 10 years of not get-
ting past the 3rd place – it was finally
time for change!
On the last weekend of February,
62 dancers, 2 captains and 4 coaches
made their way to Blackpool to com-
pete at the annual Inter-Varsity Dance
Competition held in the Empress Ball-
room – probably the most famous
ballroom dance venue in the world and
host to several of the most prestigious
competitions.
Already in the individual events
the Imperial team demonstrated its
strength. Many couples danced their
way into the finals with impressive
results – especially considering there
were about 500 couples dancing in to-
tal. In Ballroom: Guo Heng Chin & Jin-
gjing Yan won the Beginners Waltz and
came 2nd in Quickstep, Gareth Jones
& Zhiping Lin placed 6th in the Quick-
step. Michael Wong & Yun Wang came
3rd in Intermediate. Zheng Ruan &
Iwona Pilch came 7th in the Advanced
event, with Arman Sahovic & Anne-
Marie Wirth taking the coveted Ad-
vanced Ballroom crown.
In Latin the following couples made
it to the finals: Tian Yi Yuen & Yvonne
Liu won the Beginners’ Cha, James Sa-
marasekara & Iniya Rajendsan came
2nd in the Beginner’s Jive. In the Nov-
ice event: Gann Aiewsakun & Fern
Prapsiripan came 2nd, Retesh Bajaj &
Sarah Ho came 6th. In the Advanced
event, Arman Sahovic & Nicole Pa-
paioannou came 5th.
The open events were followed by
an incredible demonstration by Craig
Shaw & Natasha Manderson (who
coaches the IC Ballroom team). Their
stunning, creative and moving show
was very well received by the audience
and followed by a standing ovation.
The next highlight of the day, how-
ever, was the team event. Each uni-
versity is allowed four teams A, B, C,
D. All our teams made it into the first
division, with only our A team making
it to the final. The results for each team
were: A came 4th, B came 3rd, C and
D both came 2nd (beating Oxford) –
which added up to a very unexpected
overall 2nd place!!
After a long and exhausting day, sud-
denly everyone found renewed energy
to party all night long to celebrate this
result. This very rewarding competi-
tion concludes the season and leaves
the team with high hopes for next
year!

Drifting under bridges -

oreboding renditions of the
Travis classic ‘Driftwood’
bellowed from the clubroom
window in a questionable
showing of “support” from
the men’s squad. “And you really didn’t
think it would happen/But it really is
the end of the line.” And so it was for IC
A whom after months of winter train-
ing to secure a top ten position only
managed a 22nd placing. The crew
were stung by a swarm of crews with
higher standards than previous years,
but more critically had to cope with a
cox-box failure upon spinning at the
start line. Although the race plan had
been well studied beforehand this may
have cost the crew precious seconds
and the coveted honour of club blazers.
The result was undeserved for the crew
who have worked tirelessly in prepara-
tion for this race.
Imperial College A (Ellie Dorman,
Rachael Davies, Nicky Smith, Erica
Thompson, Selina Graham, Ro Smith,
Louise Hart, Chloe Symmonds) fin-
ished 22nd overall in 19:56.33 (11th/34
in S2) to overall winners London/Hol-
landia/Thames/Marlow/UL (18:28.27).
Further salt to the wound was the 9th
position placing of Osiris BC A whom
the IC crew repeatedly rowed through
at training a few weeks earlier. Cox Tom
Fieldman, younger brother of top-inter-
national-world-renowned-elite-crème-
de-la-crème-de-la-coxswain Henry
Fieldman (and modest too) was at the
helm of the crew. Fieldman Junior was
instrumental in the crews’ improve-
ment in the final weeks of preparation
and is highly rated by coaches and crew
at Imperial. It has never been explicitly
said that Tom is better at coxing than
Henry,buttheeldersiblingwasshocked
at the mere suggestion. “F*ck my life!
Man, you actually rate Tom higher than
me, are you kidding?! What does he
have that I don’t?” There was little hesi-
tation before the response: “Charm.”
Ex-ex-UL-cox Henry was undoubtedly
feeling guilty having coxed the women’s
UL8+ in direct competition against the
IC crew, with UL placing 18th. “Who is
coxing you at Heineken?” “You could.”
“Eh, well, eh, I’ll probably have to cox
the men’s crew… but I can cox you for
a Henley race.” The women’s squad
gratefully accept these crumbs from
the master’s table.
Imperial College B (Christina Mat-
teotti, Alice Smitheman, Stef Me-
nashe, Clarice Chung, Georgie Philips,
Christina Duffy, Hannah Rouse, Cyn-
thia Mynhardt) were coxed by Nicola
Quinn-Pyatt and placed 97th overall,
29th/69 in S3. There was little expec-
tation for the crew composed of a bow
pair who was taken out of rowing re-
tirement, a post stress-fractured three
seat and a novice at four. Officer Duffy
was not impressed at being hurried
through her pre-race stretching re-
gime; “Unless you want my shins to ex-
plode mid-race - you’ll let me stretch”.
With enough yield in their calves to go
the distance and back they rowed their
little hearts out and secured the top
100 placing they have been aiming for
all year, ahem. An epic overtaking of
RUMS was the highlight which started
at Barnes Bridge and wasn’t complet-
ed until a few lengths before Putney
Bridge. But it was done and that’s all
that matters.
Imperial College C (Julia Hong, Tam-
sin Bromley-May, Ranalie Karunartne,
Ellie Berry, Carla Canturri, Ella Bur-
roughes, Rose Stainthorp, Natasha Ga-
necki) were coxed by Libby Richards
and came 226th overall 20th/45 in the
Novice Academic category. This is a
100 place drop from last year’s novice
crew who came 126th overall (4th/48
in Novice Academic). IC C managed to
beach themselves on the way up to the
start rendering the steering control un-
predictable. The crew pin-balled their
way down the course and were lucky to
escape with just a single time penalty
for impeding other competitors.
When racing was complete all crews
retired to the Jolly Gardeners to pon-
der their fate. Inebriated chat reached
an all-time low after the disappointing
results were released. Locals later com-
plained of rowdy IC students discussing
shapes; “If I was a shape, I would so be
an ellipse.” “No-no it’s all about the cir-
cle, an ellipse is just a posh circle. You
want to get down with the common
shapes.” The party ended at London RC
with more shapes thrown around the
dance-floor.
Despite being driftwood; hollow and
of no use, there were no reports of wa-
terfalls finding, binding or grinding
any of the three crews. The pre-race
serenade led by Will Todd, Tom Bell
and Adam Seward resonated in crews’
minds as they paddled away from the
ICBC bat-cave; “Don’t stop believing/
Hold on to that feeling.” Because we
all believe in IC. The disappointment
of IC A comes with the consolation
of avoiding a major fashion faux-pas;
London fashion week have literally just
announced that blazers are last season.
They don’t accentuate the female form
like an all-in-one can.
The crew should be proud of how far
they have come in preparation for this
race and carry these achievements for-
ward to next weekend in Amsterdam
where the Heineken Roeivierkamp
takes place on the Amstel River.
Christina Duffy reports on the Women’s Head of the River
2009 as well as fashion faux-pas and famous cox’s
“Unless you
want my shins
to explode mid-
race, you’ll let
me stretch!”
