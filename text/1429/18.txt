Coffee Break
W
ell can you believe
it, it’s now the end
of term 2. The good
thing is we have the
Easter holidays to
look forward to. The bad thing, exams
are just around the corner. Let me tell
you now, next term will not be easy.
Here you are at university, spending
every last second of your time revising
all the lecture courses you have missed,
when you get a phone call from your
friends telling to come play Frisbee in
Hyde Park. You won’t be able to resist.
This is why you must spend your holi-
day break studying, and accumulating
the knowledge you should have gained
months ago. Not fair I know, however
this is the only time to catch up and
hopefully not fail your year. So while
everyone else is at home this holiday,
stock up on relentless and redbull,
top up your printer credit, and start
collecting missing lecture notes. Go
through every problem sheet now,
as doing it before you exams will just
stress you out. More so than Jov (felix
editor in chief) sending the paper to
print on a Thursday evening. Well se-
ing as you need to make the most of
the rest of this term, my advice to you
is to go mental, and party like it’s fresh-

ers’ week all over again. With one week
left hit the union every day, and enjoy
yourself more than ever at the Easter
Ball. Seriously cheap drinks, it’s going
to be awesome. It’s also the last time
you’ll get to see everyone before people
go home etc.
Also don’t forget to take a little time
out to enjoy the good weather we have
had lately. Do a bit of sun bathing, get
a few pitchers of Pims, and be social in
the quad or queens lawn. Just because
you’ve now planned to work dur-
ing the break, doesn’t mean you can’t
relax now. At least if you do it now,
you’ll have you friends about and not
look like a complete muppet sitting by
yourself. Yes I have done this, and yes
I felt like an idiot. I’m sorry, I just get
so lonely...
I’d like to now announce the win-
ner to the twitter competition. after 4
weeks, I p0wned Kadhim, by having
42 followers. The winner of the 120Gb
HDD is 8Kerski8 aka Ryan Kerr. Send
an email to felix.imperial.ac.uk to ar-
range a collection of your 120GB ex-

Controversial Research
Angers Protestors
Noh Juan Lykes Yu
Protests threaten to hit the South Ken-
sington campus for a second time in
less than two weeks as campaigners
are expected to demonstrate about
the controversial project, internally
labelled ‘CORE’, set to be complet-
ed shortly with the help of Imperial
College.
The project is believed to be the
spearhead of a global initiative that has
been under development since 2003,
looking to tackle global warming by
manipulating the Earth’s rotational pe-
riod relative to other celestial bodies.
The central structure known as an An-
ti-Spinatron is undergoing final testing
in the Mechanical Engineering lower
ground test facilities and is believed to
affect the Earth’s inner core rotation by
the use of seismic body waves.
By changing the Earth’s orbit it is be-
lieved that the Earth can be accurately
manipulated to a distance further from
the sun with the aim of achieving a
drop of 6% in annual solar radiation
absorption.
The protesters are a faction of the
same group that campaigned for the
banning of the Large Hadron Collider
experiment and have united under
the name the ‘Maintenance of Rota-
tional Stability Alliance’ (MRSA). The
protests centre around the potential
dangers of switching on the machine
and the impact it could have on the
global climate if the project proves un-
successful. They also point out that if
the project is successful then the con-
ventional Gregorian calendar will no
longer be applicable, meaning the re-
quirement of mass international inter-
vention to stabilise affected industries.
The final static tests are set to be
completed next week with initial runs
expected to commence on April 1st. If
these prove successful further develop-
ment is required and will continue to
involve the college.
RON team disqualified from
ICU Sabbatical elections
Ross Goldberg
Students at Imperial College were in
uproar after it was found that the RON
campaign, headed by legendary an-
chorman Ron Burgundy, planned to
“Make Imperial Like King’s” which is
the most likely reason for the record
elections turnout. When asked about
his actions, Mr Burgundy told felix
that “The plan, which we code named
MILK, was a bad choice!”
Returning Officer Christian ‘Beaker’
Carter, said “[he] had no choice but to
disqualify the RON team as they were
in clear violation of common sense and
basic human rights.” The argument put
forward by Mr Beaker was that “By try-
ing to make us like King’s, we would be
doing ourself an injustice!”
Recently elected ICU President Ash-
ley Brown was present that afternoon.
Delight was had by all with Mr Brown
commenting to felix that “Although
they were formidable candidates, we
are all glad that they were disqualified
as they posed a real threat.” Full elec-
tion results can be found on page 3.

Last week you walk
down the street and
you slowly notice
mothers pulling their
children closer to
them as you walk
past them. You stand confused, and confess to
the mother that despite your appearance you
are in fact not a paedophile, an even if you were
you wouldn’t go for her daughter as you’re more
into brunettes.
Horoscopes: well this is true, Union food is shit
So for the last time this term I write Horoscopes, as I write I think, “who the fuck cooks that shit?” Read on

Oh haiz honey. I hate
everyone else but
you are just about
bearable. I think I
miss WHAT THE
FUCK?!? I apologise.
I don’t know what came over me, don’t worry I
am now beating myself with my right arm that
I just ripped off. Don’t worry I promise that it
won’t happen again. Here’s a racist joke: What
does a black child get for Christmas? Your bike.
Scorpio
Wow, really can’t get
off this paedophile
theme, something is
definitely not right
here. You go to see the
doctor about this as
you start to worry. The doctor looks at you and
explains that you can’t be a paedophile because
you’re actually 12 and it’s all perfectly natural. A
paedophile you may not be, but the doctor sure as
hell is. Unlucky!
Libra
Is it OK to just hate
people without even
talking to them?
Well I currently hate
everyone, very much
you included. Look
out of the window, no really look hard as you
are going to be thrown from it and you better
choose a soft place to land. Yer that’s what I
thought piss your pants you scum. Go get your
own country.
Capricorn
What’s that coming
over the hill, is it
a monster, is it a
monster? You bet
your sorry arse it is,
because guess who’ll
be back next term; you love him, you hate him,
you want to have babies with him that would have
undoubtedly been killed if they were Trojans. Yes
everyone, Hangman is coming back, so be afraid,
be very very afraid. If not, then how about a pint?
Sagittarius
Who knows that
song “Dark End of
the Street” by Muscle
Shoals. The lyrics
go “at the dark end
of the street, that is
where we always meet, hiding is shadows where
we don’t belong...” I think of it as a rape song. If
I were going to rape you it would definitely hide
in the shadows at the dark end of the street. But
then again you’re fucking horrible so I wouldn’t.
Cancer
I feel that a certain
someone it being a
big (emphasise on
big) brave girl (read
useless fucktard).
And who could
this wonderful character be... well Jade Goody.
Unfortunately I think that the star sign used
could be a little non-PC, but this is all I had
left. Oh well. I really hope you get better. Sorry
meant I really hope you DON’T get better.
Gemini
This week you are
forced to work in the
Union kitchens. You
hate your life and
everything about it
and definitely don’t
show it when serving. Where the fuck is your
finesse? Sort your life out before I get really ag-
gressive, jump over the counter and force your
to eat that monstrous creation that you sell to
me as pasta bolognase.
Leo
So you have a little
shave this week, wash
the hair, generally
smarten up because
of the paedophile
claims last week. And
then as you’re walking down the street, you start
seeing mothers with their children, this time not
pulling them away. This makes you happy, but
are you sure you’re not a paedophile, you just
might not have met the right child yet!
Aries
What the hell is this,
there’s some sort of
bright light coming
through the very
small window in the
office, it’s blinding
me, I can’t see anything. Wait a minute, what’s
that sound? It sounds like people having a
good time. No wait, that’s screaming, oh and
I’ve figured out what that light is. You’re all
fucked, Zeus is pissed!
Pisces
So you think you
are tall? Get over it,
grow some hair and
find someone to fuck
before your balls
explode. I tell you
that it is not healthy to allow yourself to put
more than one finger up your bum at a time.
And remember to wash your hands before that
finger buffet at your grandmas house. Sleep
well, eat healthy and tell mum jokes.
Aquarius
So you wannabe
editors think my
horoscopes are shit.
Well fuck you to hell
and back! You can’t
please everyone
and I get more comments of praise than I do
of hatred. So with that in mind, how about
you get a razor, salt, vinegar and just for good
measure some AIDS in a jar, put it in a blender,
mix it all up and drink it all down! Cunts.
