Several of Imperial’s teams were taking
part in the British University and Col-
lege’s Sport’s (BUCS) Championships
last week (11-15 March). Imperial sent
a total of nine teams up to Sheffield
to take part in the competition which
brings together the best athletes from
around the country.
Men’s Volleyball
Both men’s and women’s volleyball
teams managed to make it to the finals,
something that is a great achievement
in itself and clearly shows the stand-
ard of our athletes at Imperial. On the
Saturday, the men’s team, comprising
of Johnny Zhang, Jonas Morgenweg,
Julio Jover, Alexandre, Alex Boury,

menico Corapi, Gonzalo de Gisbert,
Nicolas Vecchione and Marios Char-
tosias, played against the University of
Southampton.
Imperial won the first set quite com-
fortably and thought the opposition
would not be too hard a team to beat.
Southampton then improved as Impe-
rial started to flake resulting in them
losing the second and third set. This
turn of fortune for Imperial meant that
they had to find something extra to
ensure that the match went to a fifth
set. After saving a match point in the
fourth set, Imperial managed to win it
and eventually went on to win the fifth
set comfortably, winning the match
3-2.
On Sunday they played Nottingham

Men’s hockey win BUCS 2B divsion
After a highly successful season the
Men’s 1st XI have capped it off with a
final win away at Hertfordshire Uni-
versity. A stunning day was graced
with some glorious hockey from both
sides but the class of IC was obvious
during the whole game even after in-
tense pressure from the Hertfordshire
forwards.
The short corner routines from IC
were performing well and an early goal
from Koch left Hertfordshire stunned
by the German’s reactions. A second
goal soon followed, but by half time the
score was 2-1 after a rare mistake from
the Imperial backs.
The half time break was a welcome
relief for both sides after some scorch-
ing sun that was only matched by the
hot IC team. Avtar the great provided
inspiration and words of wisdom,
which were followed by a classic emo-
tional Cornish chat. The jaffa cakes
were an interesting choice as half time
snacks, but substituted well for the
lack of water available in the county of
Hertfordshire region.
The second half saw IC put every-
thing into the match and with an early
goal the result of the game was clear.
Classic performances all round, espe-
cially from the experienced heads of
Tunnicliffe Senior, Connick, O’Reilly
and Cornish.
The team would like to thanks both
Avtar (coach) and Mark (president) for
attending the league winning match,
and hope that they both enjoyed the
Champagne hockey.
The team now have a promotion
playoff next week against Reading,
winners of the 2A division. Celebra-
tions of their two league topping per-
formances have already commenced
however, with the mighty men’s 1s out
in force at the ACC bar night and they
will be in good voice this evening to let
the whole world know who we are.
The club also wishes the Ladies 1st
XI the best of luck for their BUCS Cup
Final next week. If you are interested
in coming to support both teams next
week at Harlington, then go to imperi-
