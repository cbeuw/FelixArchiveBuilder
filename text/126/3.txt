The addresses read to the Huxley
Society this term have distinguished
themselves by an extraordinary lack
of cliches, and the ensuing discussions
have generally been very lively. The
"Challenge to Christianity" scheduled
for delivery by Mr. J.E. Coates turned
into a challenge to Humanism: -while
casting doubts on various basic
tenets of Christianity, the speaker
held that Humanism was failing i n i t s
task of providing a set of moral
values suited to the present day.
Ethics and politios could not be separ-
ated, as the Church seemed to think;
the fundamental political issues of our
day are ethioal,and the Humanists
should lead the way.
Almost the entire audience at the
joint meeting of the Huxley Soc. and
the S.C.M. took part i n the discussion
on the Lambeth Conference. While the
results of the Conference seemed to be-
token a more humanistic attitude on
the part of the Church, the Christians
resisted attempts to convince them that
the Bible 3hould be done away with.
Heathens who preferred a more humani-
tio replacement - e.g., a concensus -
tended to get slaughtered.
Dr. Charles Bibby, whose biography
of T.H. Huxley should appear next April,
gave an entertaining and interesting
address on the subject of "T.H. Huxley,
Soientist and Humanist". T.H.H. had
left school at an early age and did not
go to university; nevertheless, or
consequently, he developed into a man
of great character and vast intellec-
tual stature. Among other exploits,
he engaged i n duels with Mr. Gladstone
i n the columns of THE TIMES, the then
Prime Minister usually emerging very
much the worse for wear, i n spite of
the fact that Huxley's letters were not
infrequently returred fox toning down
before the Editor would dare to print
them.
In Dr. Bibby's opinion, Huxley
would have thought very l i t t l e of the
present set-up of I.C. In 1881, part
of the function of R.C.S. was to train
Science teachers. and Huxley considered
this a vital "role, His views on edu-
cation were quite definite, and admitted
by his clerical antagonists to be sound;
they are to a large extent embodied i n
our present day educational system.

Incidentally, the 1958-59 Calendar
refers to Huxley as a vigorous supporter
of the "broader policy" of "the diffusi-
on of scienoe generally as applied to
productive industry". This i s a most
novel concept of ''broad", and the Ad-
ministration i s to be congratulated on
what i s probably the first original idea
i t has had since Huxley died. While
the hacks who oompiled this "Short His-
tory of the College" have credited
Huxley with "ideas and personality",
they have carefully omitted any men-
tion of what these ideas were (apart
from the nonsense quoted above), even
though his views on the training of
teachers, for example, were implemented
in the curriculum of the Normal School
of Science. His ideas were too uncon-
ventional to last. P.B.Levin.
BEES IN YOUR BOTANY
Ted H i l l , a well-known figure i n the
Geology Department, i s a laboratory
Superintendent but i t wasnot for this
that our oontenrporary THE TIKES chose
to publish his photograuh.
He i s possd, next to his beehive,
on top of the Botany Building! " i n
the background is the Albert Hall over
whioh the bees f l y on their way to the
park". With things like bees kept
under our very noses (as i t were) i t i s
high time that the presence of any other
strange creatures was brought to the
notice of the students.
On the afternoon of 5th Nov.
as a result of a well organised raid,
carried out by a number of geologists,
the "carrot" wa3 abducted from N.E.C.,
brought back to South Kensington, paint-
ed in the colours of the Royal College
of Soienoe and displayed the following
day i n the entrance hall of R.C.S.
It was proposed that Mr. Heathcoat
' Amory,who was giving a lecture that
lunch hour, would be asked to auto-
grabh this weird specimen, but this
did not materialise.
An attempt by Guilds to steal the
object was forestalled by i t s removal
to the hostel, since this would only
have resulted in a fight, causing no
doubt, as other inter-college rags have
done i n the past, a great deal of dam-
age; as well as disturbing a rather
distinguished visitor.
THE CARROT
Having heard well-founded rumours
that a horde-of maddened N.E.C. men
were about to descend upom the College
the "Carrot" was therefore sent off
immediately to Kew Gardens, - for class-
ification.
The N.E.C. men, on arrival were in-
formed of the fate of their beloved
mascot and departed i n peace, their
President being officially informed by
'phone.
With the, "Carrot" was dispatched
the followioa letter:-
Bear Sir,
Please find enclosed one large oar-
rot discovered during a botanical exp-
edition sponsored by the Royal College
of Science Student Union of South Ken-
sington.
Our botanical department suggest
t.'iat the purple and silver colouration
may be due to a sudden change of env-
ironment, whilst the letters R.C.3.
appear to be an unusual photosynthetic
phenomenon.
We are taking the opportunity of
forwarding this specimen in the hope
that your experts will combine to
produce a comprehensive classification.
The carrot is the treasured veg-
etable of Northampton Engineering
College, St. John St., Clerkenwell,
Phone CLE 0201. We understand that
you will be contacted by the above
College who are eager to hear of your
conclusions.
P. Emerson,
Vice-President R.C.S.
A reply wa3 received the following
Monday -
Dear Sir,
The remarkable vegetable ref-
erred to in your letter has arrived
here. The ourious colouration i s not,
as your botanical department surmises,
due to a physiological oause, but is the
result of the action of a pathogen comm-
only known as "rag", a somewhat common
virus afflicting the youth of these
realms. There is apparently no cure.
Dulce est desipere in loco.
Dr. N.L. Bor,
Assistant Director.
