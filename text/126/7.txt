encouraging starts to the Season.

ATHLETICS MOTORING
The U.L. Winter Relays Competi-
tion, .and Tjalve trophy for field
events, took place on Wednesday 12th
Nov. Conditions were not exactly per-
fect: a persistent drizzle hanging
over a porridge track, with a mud
bath in the middle, whioh soon had the
throwers slipping badly, causing their
implements to pursue rather erratio
and dangerous directions.
In spite of Nature's aggression,
performances were quite good for the
time of year and the I.C. relay teams
excelled themselves. Our sprint
relay (4 x 110 yards) team, consisting
of 3 freshers, took both the heat and
final with contemptuous ease.
The olub was 4th out of a large
field i n the long medley relay, but
the race of the afternoon was the final
of the (220 220 440) relay, before
which I.C. was only 1 point behind St.
Mary's College Hospital. Although
on the last leg we had a lead of 15
yards, the St. Mary's anchor, iiorman
Putter U.L. first string, eventually
closed the gap to just beat U3 at the
tape. Thus for the second year I.C.
have just been beaten i n these relays.
The field events were very dis-
appointing for the club with many of
our best men"otherwise engaged".
Special thanks are given to those who
keenly turned out at last minute notice.
Consequently, I.C. were disgracefully
6th equal: but congratulations are
expressed to our long and triple jumpers
who saved the position from being even
worse.
Despite a University Cross-
country Race the previous day two m
e
m
-
bers (A.E. Brown and J.H. Collins)
of I.e. took part i n a "Two-raan-Ten-
mile" relay at Hurlingham on Sunday
morning.
Totalling 47 mins 17.6 sees for
the distance they were second to a team
from Battersea (46:55) - en average of
71 seconds per 440 yd. lap.
It is hoped to introduce more of
these races i n the near future. A l l
athletes, who are interested, should
keep an eye on the notice board.

BRIGHTON RUN
The traditional weather of driv-
ing drizzle and cold winds greeted the
start of the Veteran Car Club's Annual
Run
Boanerges, running better than
ever before, jjot off to a good start,
just before 8 o'clock, fully laden with
Mr. Moore, the C & G Motor Club C
o
m
m
-
ittee and Dave Clark - C & G President.
A record turnout of police lined the
route out of London and for once we were
greeted with enthusiasm and respect by
a l l . By the time we reached Streatham
the rain had begun to penetrate and
Dave Clark left us to return home. +
flask! But with Mr. Moore at the
wheel and Brian Wellstead on the throt-
tle we rocketed on, past red traffic
lights, to the right of "Keep Left"
signs, and everywhere with complete
priority. At Thornton Heath Pond
a Volkswagen dithered i n front of us
and we were forced to collide with i t s
rear wing (which crumpled absorbing most
of the impact). A quick inspection
revealed no serious damage to Bo, so
we changed drivers and were off again.
A few more stop3 - an inlet valve
check, o i l replenishment, and to free
a jammed top gear - sufficed; and a3
the clocks were striking 12 o'clock
we entered Brighton and signed off
in Madeira Drive.
Then followed an admirable lunch
at Clarges Hotel-with 45 members of
C & G and R.C.S. Motor Club present.
The afternoon saw more heavy rax>
for the Parade, but as we left the out-
skirts at about 5 o'clock the heavers
at last relented and we fairly burnt
up the back roads through Horsham to
Dorking. Here again a large party of
Motor Club members greeted us at the
hospitable White Horse Inn.
At half past eight we left Dorking
echoing to a mixed cacophony of Jeaebel's
bell, Bo's exhaust, and cheering friends.
After one long stop at Wimbledon, Bo
eventually limped th
e last few miles
home and reached Guilds at just on
11 o
.
