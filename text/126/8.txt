RUGBY
The 1st XV are continuing to enjoy
a good season, having reached the seoond
round of the U.L. Cup by defeating
(quite convincingly) Chelsea Poly.
They sustained their first defeat agai-
nst Bridgwater by the narrow margin of
5-0. This i s a very creditable
result against such a strong team,
bearing i n mind that I.C. were with-
out some of their key players.
The second team were also defeat-
ed for the f i r s t time last weekend,
by London Welsh Dragons. This was
by far their strongest fixture to date,
having been moved up one side from last
season. Next season the 1st XV will
play the "Druids".
Last Saturday the 'A' XV, a side
almost unchanged from that which was
chosen, were unlucky to lose 6-8 to
a fairly strong London Welsh 'A' XV.
Two breaks in the first half gave the
visitors an 8-0 lead. The second
half 3aw the extra fitness of the ool-
lege side come into play and the Welsh
side were hard pressed to hold their
lead. Taurins kicked two penalties.
The lower side3 are enjoying mixed
successes, but from a l l accounts they
are enjoying their Rugby and are now
entering into the 'Spirit' of the Club.
If anybody i n the College would
like to start playing Rugby, they would
be very welcome. Their support i s
needed to enable us to field a l l of
our teams each week, and i n return we
oan guarantee thejar very pleasant
Saturday evenings away from a l l the
cares of the world.

MORPHY DAY
The Lorry Cup was the first to be
raced for on Wednesday. With the high
tide flooding the towpath the crews
paddled out to Hammersmith Bridge i n
poor v i s i b i l i t y . I t was evident right
from the start that the race was bet-
ween R.C.S. and Guilds; the Miners
however putting up a gallant show.
R.C.S. quickly went into a lead which
they never looked like losing, eventu-
ally beating Guilds by one length.
A fast start was made i n the Morphy
Cup race, a l l three crews rowing well
for about a third of the mile when
R.C.S. crowded Guilds and the race
had to be rerowed. A good start was
again made, Guilds going into the
lead and rowing a steady 32 with R.C.S.
34. and Mine3 28. Mines were soon out
of the race but R.C.S. held on a few
feet behind Guilds. It seemed to be
anybody's race until the boathouse where
Guilds showed their power, to finish
a length ahead of R.C.S. This well
rowed race was one of the closest seen
and certainly well worth watching.

JUDO
On Sat. Nov. 8th I.C. Judo Club
drew a closely fought match with Cam-
bridge University. Out of 6 contests,
J. Bowles won his, 4 were drawn and one
lost.
On Sat. Nov. 15th I.C. entered a
team of 5 i n the British Universities
Eliminations far the South Eastern
Team. Three of our number fought
their way into the Regional Team;
the other, two are reserves. The Cap-
tain, John Shepperd, did very well by
beating the Cambridge Captain by a pow-
erful Tewaza (Hand Throw), so that he
now leads the Regional Team in the
Finals on 29th Nov. at the Budakwai.
SWIMMING
The swimming section continued
their undefeated run, and enhanced
their ohanoes of wining the University
Championships again, beating KINGS by
33 pts. to 17 pts. Individual winners
for I.C. were Harford, Loveman and
Shorey, who had good support from
Wilson, Alloook, Jones and Poet. A
polo match followed i n which I.C.
beat KINGS by 5-2. Baa ham 2, Jones,
Larson, and Shorey, scoring for I.C.
Despite their suocess i n inter-
collegiate matches, the water polo
team has yet to record a win, against
London olub opposition. Last week's
visitors Richmond, defeated I.C. by 8
goals to 2. The I.C. team cracking
in the second half of a very fast game.
Both goals far I.C. were scored by
Hart.
The next week, opposition was
provided by a team of University players,
who won a hard fought match by 5 goals
to 4. Goals for I.C. were scored by
Jones 2, Hart and Shorey.
The second team have yet to score
their first victory, but at present,
although a third division team, they
have been forced to take on second
division teams. As a result defeat
is not entirely unexpected; i n fact the
team ha3 done very well in loosing to
more experienced opponents by narrow
margins. Last week they l03t 6-2 to
L.S.E.; Mears scaring both goals for
I.C.
CROSS COUNTRY.
The f i r s t team travelled to Birmi-
ngham on Nov. 8th to take part i n the
"Midlands Match", i n which the major
London Colleges ran against a number of
Midland Universities. The result was
highly satisfactory from our point of
view - with I.C. 1st Birmingham 2nd
and Manchester 3rd, with the other Lon-
don Colleges well and truly beaten.
The team scores were:
1. I.C. 72
2. Birmingham 83
3. Manchester 83
4. Kings (London) 197
5. U.C. (London) 215
6. L.S.E. 217
The I.C. team must be congratu-
lated for this first-class performance.
Their individual positions were:
4. Collins, 6. Briggs, 8. Larknm, 17
Jaeger, 18. Brown, 19. Cleator (in a
field of 66).
On the same day the I.C. second and
third teams easily defeated Goldsmiths
College, the race being won by D. Ham-
monds, who was followed i n by Warren,
Huntley, Barker, Auton, James (I.C. tak-
ing the f i r s t six places). The captain
appears i n a very lowly place i n the
results of this race, but i t should be
mentioned that he was led astray and
ran a mile too far. (What led him
astray?!!).
The following Wednesday, I.C.
defeated Q.M.C. at Petersham by
32 pts. to 50. The fir3t six I.C.
positions were:
1. A. Brown and G. T i l l y (equal,
29:55); 4. Bernard; 7. Hammonds;
8. Warren; 10. Sandoz.
On Saturday, Nov. 15th, I.C.
defeated U.C., but were beaten by a
strong Vale of Aylesbury A.C. team.
The I.C. team was, of course, weakened
by the fact that our 6 best men were
running for U.L. against Oxford.
The numerical strength of the Club this
year is shown by the fact that we had
17 men in this race. The f i r s t six
I.C. positions were f i l l e d by 4. Tilly,
7. Bernard, 8. Gilbert, 10. Rayment,
13. Hammonds, 14. Manson.
London University were narrowly
defeated 32-47 by Oxford, but we con-
gratulate John Collins of I.C. who was
the f i r s t London man home, i n 4th place,
only 20 sees, behind the winner. Briggs
finished 10th and Larkum 13th for the
U.L. 1st team. In the second team
match Oxford beat London 40-62; the
three I.C. representatives, Jaeger,
Cleator and Brown finished 7th, 9th and
12th respectively.
W
e hope a l l SPORTSMEN will come
to the 'PELJJC* HOP.
