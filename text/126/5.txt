L E T T E R S
ENGLISH
Dear Sir,
I was interested to read the
contribution 'The .Queens English' i n
your previous issue; I feel i t brings
out very well an attitude which i s
very prevalent in academic circles
and one with which I disagree.
Starting by confessing uncertainty
as to why we are here at a l l - which
is understandable i f he regards the
'Science & Technology' of our t i t l e
as "Scientific irrelavancies" - your
contributor continues to ask "What is
an education?", concluding that i t i s
a process aimed at turning the student
into a 'benefit to humanity' - pres-
umably on a plane with mains water and
sewage farms, not a tool to enable the
student to obtain a larger share of the
good things of l i f e - which i s why
most of U3 are here,if we bother to
think about i t .
Our training i s aimed at enabling
us to produce something which others
w i l l buy. Frequently this requires a
jargon, almost a foreign language,
among our colleagues for Queen's Eng-
l i s h i s not a suitable tool - but we
have only to say to our oustomer 'Here
i t i s , i t works*. I f i t does not work
i t i s best buried without a report in
impeccable English,for l i f e i s too short.
Language i s , at best, an inade-
quate tool, a living thing which con-
stantly changes to meet our needs but
never catches up the flying thoughts
i t strives to express. We augment the
written word with many forme of sym-
bolic notation of which mathematics
and the engineers drawing are perhaps
good examples.
The only valid test of a word i s
does i t express the required meaning?
A sausage, a sossige or even a sozzidge
are very similar under the skin, even
Shakespeare spelt his own name in
several ways.
Perhaps numpty Dumpty went too
far when he said "When 1 use a word
i t means just what I want i t to mean",
but every writer of a report should
have always before him the next remark
"The question i s , whioh i s to be Master
- that's a l l " .
Tours faithfully.

KULCHER
Dear Sir,
In various parts of your last iss-
ue i t was revealed that -
a) the College i s overcrowded
b) the refectories are 'chronically'
congested ( i t is often quioker to go
to one of the cheap caff's around Glouc-
ester/Road, but the proletarian client-
ele is already complaining of over-
orewding, and a spirit of revolution is
in the air.)
c) many of the students are semi-illi-
terate.
d) the vast majority cannot take their
drink like gentlemen, and
e) Mooney is steadily losing apparatus.
And Mr. Taylor is alarmed that the
College no longer requires a pass at 0-
Level in Eng. Lang. So am I. As I
see i t , there are two possible solut-
ions to our problems. The first is of
course to make entrance requirements more
stringent) preferably eliminating idio-
ts, drunks and kleptomaniacs. To do
this, 0-Level Eng. L i t . and an unblem-
ished Scouting record might be adequate.
The second solution, which would only
occur to a man of genius, would be to
eliminate people like Literate John
Taylor, Gentleman John Braaley and, above
a l l , myself - I'm sorry I came, really.
May I suggest that only those who have
actually failed 0-Level Eng. Lang, sho-
uld be admitted.
here,
Having wonderful time, wish you were

HALLS OF RESIDENCE
Dear Sir,
We the undersigned would like to
suggest that there is a good case
to be made -for the inclusion of Const-
ituent College Halls of Residence in
the plans for the Princes Gardens site.
We are concerned that at no stage in
the development of these plans have the
Constituent College Unions been cons-
ulted about a question whioh is so
fundamental to their survival.
There i s general agreement that
smaller units are likely to command
greater loyalties than the large and
amorphous Imperial College Union.
The controversy is concerned with the
composition of these units. We suggest
that the most effective division should
take account of both our traditions and
our learning, and we believe that we
should preserve the status quo with
regard to the Constituent Colleges.
The Colleges embody almost a l l of
the tradition which i s assembled under
the name of Imperial College. There
i s no doubt in our minds that the sep-
aration of students into Halls of Res-
idence on any arbitrary principle will
mean the effective end of the Constit-
uent Colleges. We believe that this
would be a bad thing for the Imperial
College.
We remain, sir,
Yours etc.

NELSON'S COLUMN
Contrary to general opinion, i t
appears that somebody does read this
column, far Nelson has received the
following letter:-
Dear Sir,
I would like to oorreot an item
of news which appeared in the last
Nelson's Column. Firstly, Peter
Soott became a father after his term
of office as Entertainments Officer for
Mines, and secondly, my wife has alrea-
dy had the baby which was reported
as being expected.
R.S.M.U. Entertainments Officer.
This is a very interesting letter
from Mr. Rsmu, especially the last
information, which i s unique, for
this i s the f i r s t known case of a baby
being born before i t was expected.
Who said I.C. was backward?
One of the Editors i s sharing
a new g i r l friend called Belinda; he
says that, although she's a bit 'slow
to start, once hot, she turns over
wonderfully.
We hear that there is a move to
throw labourers out of the bar when they
come in for a drink and ask to have
their helmets filled. It seems
that Soottie can't get the brim under
the pump.
I THINK THEY OUGHT TO MAKE IT|
A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.
