We are producing a special 12-page
bumper edition to mark the Christmas
festivities. This w i l l be on sale in
a fortnight - PRICE 6d.
The increase in price i s due to
the extra printing involved. We strese
the fact that the prioe of this issue
will be 6d. as we are only too well
aware of the financial inertia, whicn
prevails at Imperial College. Even
now some people s t i l l express surprise
when their offer of 3d. for FELLX i s
refused. (The prioe rose from 3d, to
4d> TWO YEARS AGO)

LIKELY STORIES No 3
by Scraper
George 0'Donovan made cockroaches.
He didn't actually make very many, but
they 'begat one another i n the usual
way and waxed very numerous. In due
course, as was statistically inevitable,
there evolved Arthur and Nelly, who were
so scientifically roinded that their
families sent them off to I.C.
Now, the cockroaches didn't know
that George 0'Donovan made them, but
they were shrewd enough to suspect
that someone had and, in order to keep
on his/her right aide, i t was their
custom to sacrifioe some of their
number every Christmas. When Arthur
and Nelly came home after their f i r s t
terra of scientific training, they sud-
denly realised how bareerio their
fellows were. "Tea can't do this, i t ' s
hot human" they protested. "Indeed?"
remarked the High Priest, and he raised
his eye-brows and sharpened his knife.
And i t oame to pass accordingly,
that George 0'Donovan looked out of
his window and observed Arthur and Nelly
on the verge of extinction, where-
upon he arose in great wrath and smote
the assembled multitude with a gross
of thunder-bolts. When the holocaust
had subsided, there remained only
Arthur and Nelly who, without further
ado, fled back to I.C. Which i s why
most cockroaches live i n the Lower Ref-
eotory.
Next door, at the Lyric* i s another
piroduotion with a truly Preach flavour!
"Irma Le. Douce", set to muslo tells
of a young law student'a oOmplioationc
with a prostitute, and, were i t not
for the fact that anything French is.
forgivable, would be distinctly near
the mark.
Booking has now started for the
"West Side Story", a new Ameriarn mus-
i c a l whioh opens i n London (Her Majes-
ty's) on December 12th: this i s a re-
hash of Romeo and Juliet, enlivened by.
Mew York's gang warfare, and i s suppose-
dly the toughest musioal ever to have
come from Amerioa,
Within a stone's throw of I.e.,
and worthy of an hour's perusal, is
the London Museum, adjoining Kensing-
ton Palace: here may be found collec-
tions of robes, tapestries and objate
d'art illustrating the history and
social l i f e of London from the Middle
Ages. The State Apartments of the
Monarch during the 18th and 19th Cen-
turies (the birthplace of Q. Victoria)
may also be seen. Open Sundays
2-4 p.m. Ad. free.
PLAN X
Three men stood at a window, watoh-
ingjone flick of a newspaper from the
man leaning against the wall opposite,
Mid they were galvanised *tnta action.
Plan X was under way.
The date was November 12th, the
object of the plan was to keep a certain
Mitchelin Man in a safe plaoe, and yet
be at Putney, and the sero hour was L.W

ing a yellow, black, and white, rubber
model, boarded a waiting car i n Prince
Consort Road, and drove off towards H

ersmith. Thirty-five minutes later they
embarked on a fast launch at Hammersmith
Pier, and made their way to Putney.
On the towpath two groups of the
enemy were fighting one another;
pears, thunderflashes, and smoke scre-
ens were being used by the dye stai-
ned savages.
After a l i t t l e rnanoeuvering a wet
President, who had arrived in his smoke
belching Regal Chariot, was picked up
from the railings, having waded across
the flooded roadway. Immediately
the Red Ensign was replaced by the
flag of the Royal School of Mines,
and "Mitch" proudly raised on high.
The launch was used as a mobile
grandstand from whioh to watch the
•races. Maybe the Mines crew would have
done better i n the launch than in-
their
shells.
