HOPOLOGY
What i s a "Hop*'' According to the
Encyclop.iia Moronica, i t i s not (as
Rugby men will imagine) that dark lump
that slides down th'= throat i n a care-
less pint jf Whitbread like a long-
dead mousej but a social gathering of
doubtfu" significance wher*; unusual phys-
ical behaviour -patterns and abilities
are counternanoeo.
Thus, although i t is "a b i t off"
to paw a partner at a private party, i t
is accepted that recreative wrestling
and vertical gymnastics will be dis-
played at such a gathering.
Glassy-eyed, the anxious male,
"Homo anticipans", licks his lips as
he surveys the field before him. No
jolly farmer even studied and prodded
sheep more oarefully than he, before the
lucky victim i s saluted with the trad-
itional and time-honoured greeting: "Care
to creep, Kid?" Grasping the oontrols
he steers off at a dangerous angle, with
out signals, trying hard not to tread
on the pedals too often.
It i s rare indeed, I find, as I
wander unseen with my tape-recorder,
notebook and camera team among the
happy c >ples, to hear the old gam-
bit "Come here often". No, the I.C.
man has more inventive genius than
this. Specimens I have recorded
inolude -
"I work in a wind-tunnel, you know.."
"I nave such t cosy room in the
Hostel.."
".. well, I can t e l l you what part-
henogenesis i s not" and many more,
a l l reflecting the many and varied int-
erests of this College.
On second thoughts, perhaps they
do not do that at alx, perhaps the men
of I.C. have something el3e in mind,
who knows?
Go to the top floor and you will
see a different phenomenon, resembling
the fertility rites (or wrongs, per-
haps) of the Sdos in their wild act-
ivity and athletic caperings; the
delicate in mind will claim no harm-
onic or xuel significance here, but
they are wrong - the whole business
is a fallacy.
The zoologist is fascinated by the
many varieties of "Sniggus athletic-
ans" he can obtain here and, prov-
ided with notebook and sheltered by a
Life-reserver (some of the kicks are
high and hard) he may wander to his
heart's content amongst the happy
natives, who ignore tlic intrusion.
In addition, the torpid can
find comfort in the various lounges
of the Union, a comfort marred only
by'the regrettable tendency for the
lights to go out so that few couples
can read last week's newspapers and
this has ruined many an evening.
FELIX
'•'hat happens after the Hop
finishes officially has been a special
study of mine - i t varies with the hop
and the closing hour. Although
I.CvW.A. can rightly boast "We never
close" without lisping, a l l good things
must end sometime - on the average,
normal conditions return by the
following Saturday morning just in time,
in fact, for the next Hop.
Sig will appear at the Felix Hop -
Nov. 22nd., in the Union, to psych-
oanalyse any with troubles - two couches,
no waiting.
Everyone else of the same name has
asked me to point out that they are no
relation to the other Mr. Leston.
