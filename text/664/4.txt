It's been a hard week for this
tfnfortunate, o v e r - w o r k e d
sketch writer. He had hoped for a
quick Publications Board meet-
ing on Monday evening (so he
could race up to the West End
and drool over Natassia Kinski in
her latest film) and a longish
Union General Meeting to pro-
vide the usual quota of funnies
for his customary amusing (?-Ed)
sketch.
However it was not to be. Pub
Board lasted over two hours—
primarily due to STOIC being
represented by the two biggest
tits in College—and the U G M for
a mere three minutes (that's
right—180 seconds) because the
third biggest tit in College called
quorum when the meeting
refused to let him have his way.
He had wanted the clearly
giquorate meeting to discuss the
motions first as he feared some-
one would call quorum if the
order of business was not
changed to hear the officers
reports after the motions. He was
defeated and called quorum
himself; meaning that, by
anyone's logic, he was afraid of
himself, which suggests he
deserves our sympathy rather
than our contempt. Tough luck
sucker, and I know not who they
are, you're getting no sympathy
here.
The meeting then continued
informally with a general dis-
cussion which proved reasonably
fruitful, but not enough to
overcome the basic problem of
writing 650 words on three
minutes. This has been done
before; actually someone once
wrote a book called The First
Three Minutes, but he was
subsequently awarded the Nobel
Prize for Physics and this
physicist is of slightly lower
calibre. Nevertheless Physics did
provide the only highlight of the
day when a lecturer finished a full
T E N M I N U T E S EARLY giving
time to hurry home and watch
Grange Hill and Tucker's luck.
And now that we've touched
on the subject of education, why
can't College be more like these
programmes?—the only similar-
ity seeins the presence of a
closely-cropped villian called
Passmore in both. Note however

that, realistic as they are, the
words pimp and dildo have never
been mentioned on these pro-
grammes. On Tuesday however
the former was used to describe
all Union members in a motion
tabled for the meeting and the
latter was the generic name once
applied to R S M U 2nd X I by
m i d f i e l d U G M C h a i r m a n
Passmore as they fell to a not
uncommon defeat to one of the
better College teams.
Someone then asked (at the
U G M , not Grange Hill) if the
proposers of the motion could be
sued for defamation but he
received little sympathy from the
chair who suggested that it was a
mtter for the small claims court.
External Affairs Officer Peter
Burt will now make his custom-
ary appearance (sic) in this
column by virtue of winning the
hastily arranged Quote of the
Meeting Award. His little gem was
'as you may have heard from
reading the papers' (geddit?).
Runner-up was Pressie Gaynor
Lewis reading a moving poem on
the baked bean situation in the
Union Refectory by Pub Board
Chairman Dave Rowe. It was a
successful week for M r Rowe
who had earlier received the The
Agatha Christie This Meeting Will
Run and Run Award for his
performance at the previously
mentioned marathon meeting.
