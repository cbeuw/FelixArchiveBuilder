a t i o n c o n c e r n i n g
housing benefits was revised last
year, and students can now claim
rebates from the rent and rates
they pay both in term time and
during the Christmas and Easter
vacations instead of supple-
mentary benefit. The under-
graduate grant currently
provides you with an income of
£59.29 per week during term
time, of which £19.45 is paid to
cover accommodation costs.
During the Christmas/Easter
vacations the grant drops in value
to £24.55 per week, with no
provision for accommodation
charges. In theory, therefore, you
should be able to claim some kind
of rebate if you spend more than
the term time allowance on
housing or if you pay rent over
the vacation. Postgraduate
grants are paid on a 52 week
basis, and unfortunately they
cannot claim back vacation rents.
There are now two systems of
rent and rates rebate.
Certified Housing Benefit
Few students are likely to be
eligible for certified housing
benefit, as payment is authorised
by the DHSS to refund the
housing costs of those receiving
supplementary benefit. If you are
c l a i m i n g s u p p l e m e n t a r y
unemployment benefit and you
need to claim housing benefit you
should tell the unemployment/
supplementary benefit office
dealing with your claims. You
will eventually receive forms to
be returned to your local housing
authority, who are the body
which deals with this part of your
application. If they are satisfied
that you are eligible, they will pay
you your entitlement. If you can
get certified housing benefit it is
well worth having, as it can
provide a 100% rebate of your
housing costs, as treated by Town
Halls.
Standard Housing Benefit
You do not have to be claiming
supplementary benefit to receive
standard housing benefit, and
students can therefore apply for
it. Students in private rented
accommodation or College flats
may get a rebate of anything
between about £1 and £3 per
week or more, although students
living in Halls of Residence are
unlikely to get much money back
due to the way their Hall bill
breaks down.

How to apply for standard
housing benefit
You will need to fill in the
relevant form which can be
collected from your Town Hall
(or Student Services if you live
locally). This should be filled in
and returned to your Housing
Authority as soon as possible, as
you will only be paid from the
date they receive y o u r
application. They will require
evidence of your financial and
residential status, so you will
need to show them your
Notification of Award, most
recent bank statement, building
society savings books, etc and
either your rent book or a letter
from your landlord (Student
Services if you live in College
run for both term time and
vacation periods. Your borogh
may ask you to reapply over the
vacation even if they do not, you
should write to then: at the end of
term reminding them that your
income from your grant has
dropped to £24.55 per week
during the holiday period and
asking them to reassess your
claim.
You will probably have a long
wait before you actually get any
money, so it may pay you to keep
in touch with your housing
benefit office. It is generally best
to communicate with them via
post to be sure that the
appropriate staff actually deal
with your problem.
Supplementary Benefit and
Unemployment Benefit
Students are entitled to these
benefits during term time as they
are usually dependent on the
claimant's availability for work.
However, a few students may be
should be further processed for
p o s s i b l e e n t i t l e m e n t to
S u p p l e m e n t a r y B e n e f i t .
Supplementary Benefit is paid on
the baiss of low income and
availability for work, and if you
receive a grant you will be very
u n l i k e l y to q u a l i f y for
supplementary benefit during the
academic year. However, L E A
grants only cover 38 weeks of the
year excluding the summer
vacation, so if you do not have a
holiday job but are nevertheless
available for work you should
apply for supplementary benefit
over the summer.
How to claim Supplemen-
tary and Unemployment
Benefit.
On the first week day of the
vacation go down to your local
unemployment benefit office
(address in phone book) and sign
on. You will need to know .your
National Insurance number and
may require proof of identity.
Be prepared to hang around
for a long time! You should be
given an attendance card, a copy
of form B l and other forms
appertaining to your status as a
student. These should be
completed and returned. You
may also be asked to attend an
interview, to which you should
take details of rent paid/financial
situation etc.
You will probably have to sign
on on a weekly or fortnightly
basis at your local office to
confirm that you are still
property). You will also need
proof of the dates of your terms
at College, and the address of the
nearest post office at which you
can cash your giro-cheques
if/when they arrive.
You can claim Standard
Housing Benefit both in term
time and over the vacation.
However, when you submit your
claim you should make very clear
that you wish your application to
eligible for unemployment
benefit during the vacations. If
you have paid Class 1 National
Insurance contributions on
earnings of £1350 in the 1981/2
tax year or of £1475 in the 1982/3
tax year when you can apply, and
should receive £27.05 benefit per
week. You may also be entitled to
housing benefit.
If you are not eligible for
unemployment benefit your case
available for work.
You should note that when an
unmarried couple live together as
husband and wife, they are
considered as married by the
DHSS. Unless you can prove that
you live totally independently,
the woman will be treated as a
dependent of the man, with the
next rsult that the man has to
claim for the woman and the
couple receive less benefit.
