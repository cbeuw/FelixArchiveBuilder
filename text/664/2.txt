Dear Pallab
On reading last week's
F E L I X , I was very displeased
with the news item, entitled
T C U Slams U G C ' . The first
three paragraphs I suppose you
could call news. However the
last paragraph was written in
totally a different vain.
Here your News Editor (J
Martin Taylor) seems to have
compiled his own little editorial
so for those people who have
read this section, I would
like to put the matter straight.
; Where J Martin says 'it is
widely believed that the Union's
" comments will not be taken too
s e r i o u s l y , ' does he not
mean—that he does not believe,
as he was the only person who
read and was therefore able to
comment on the report.
He then concluded by saying
'in the opinion of a number of
people who have read her
report'. That is a number of
people, meaning one person—
himself.
I will therefore ask your
News Editor to refrain from
deliberate exaggeration and to
put only news into news
articles, not his own personal
opinion, and, then claim that it
was also the opinion of many
others.
Yours sincerely
Sean Davis

At last I am a happy man.
Words can scarcely express the
I delight that 1 felt on finding that
the baked beans in the Union
• Refectory were at last hot on
Monday.
Each fork-full of the perfectly
formed beans (in a steaming hot
tomato sauce) cleaved to my
palate rendering me speechless
with delight.
May IC join NUS, may the
i Union move to Southside, may
the tiles fall off Elec Eng, may
the Bot/Zoo tea room close
tomorrow; but please, oh please
may the baked beans never be
cold again.

WIST
Survey
Dear Pallab
A group of women at College
are carrying out research for a
paper to be presented at the
1984 S R H E (Society for
R e s e a r c h i n t o H i g h e r
Education) conference. The
paper will be concerned with
women presently studying for a
science and engineering degree,
and women who decided to
leave college mid-course. We
have had a good response to the
questionnaire sent out before
Christmas, and would like to
ask all those women who have
not yet completed their
questionnaires to please do so
as soon as possible. This will
enable us to compile a paper
including all of the wide ranging
views of women in College—the
project being especially
important since 1984 is
'Women into Science and
Engineering' (WISE) year, and
the various committees are
involved are very eager to see
research on this subject
published in their effort to
encourage more women to take
up s c i e n t i f i c / e n g i n e e r i n g
subjects at all levels.
Thanks for passing the
message on.
Yours

Dear Sir
You recently telephoned me
for information about our Com-
mon Room in the Beit Quad-
rangle. I gave it to you but did so
reluctantly in light of your
distorted reporting of earlier
related events.
In future if you want informa-
tion from me about the Depart-
ment will you please ask for it in
writing. I shall then do my best to
oblige you if your request is
reasonable. I shall do so in
writing and as quickly as circum-
stances permit.

Dep Rep
Elections
Dear Pallab
You mentioned in your
editorial last week, the hack
elections. H o w e v e r y o u
ommitted to mention the
impending dep rep elections
(papers up Tues 24).
It is time for ordinary
students in the College to wake
up and realise what is
happening around them.
Education cuts mean that
changes will have to be made.
Unless students know what is
going on, then they will suffer.
The job of a dep rep should
not be taken on by a final year
student who suddenly finds
him/herself with nothing on
his/her CV. Neither should it be
used just as a step towards hack
(or CCU) heirarchy.
Dep Reps need to care for
their students, their depart-
ment, their Union and their
College. A good Dep Rep does
not have a quiet life.
Dedicated people, your
students need you.

Dear Pallab
As a supplement to the typing
course on which you were
apparently sent (the upshot of
which I shall refrain from
making comment on here!),
may I suggest that you attend a
course in the art of text editing;
an art in which—judging by the
way you pejoratively and
clumsily edited a letter of mine
(printed in the F E L I X of 20
January)—your abilities as
F E L I X E d i t o r a p p e a r
s o m e w h a t d u b i o u s and
incompetent!
I refer of course to the way in
which you unceremoniuosly cut
short the letter half way
through a paragraph, without

Dear Pallab
This letter is one of many I
hope to be sending over the next
few weeks to inform people
inside and outside College of
our Union selling porn.
I remember the feeling of
frustration and anger I felt at
the beginning of my first year
when I wrote a highly
emotional letter to F E L I X and
a number of outside organisa-
tions c o m p l a i n i n g about
pornography in our College.
Chris Crownshaw criticised me
then for washing 'dirty linen' in
public. Over a year has past, we
have had four opportunities to
wash that 'dirty linen' yet as a
result of the Mines' campaign
and our own apathy we have
not done so. The pornographic
events continue.
There are many ignorant
people in this College, there are
many who do not care to think
about reality and choose to live
in their private little worlds
away from nuclear weapons,
degradation, poverty, i n -
humanity and war. Their
attitude towards the porno-
graphic industry in this College
is a symptom. R S M U in its
actions at U G M s and elsewhere
has s t a u n c h l y defended
prejudice, ignorance and
naivity. The 'Save Mines
Campaign' was one to defend
them if from anything from the
real world, the world of
suffering that they wish to
forget and wash their hands of.
The letters and the motion at
the U G M are not an attempt to
wash our 'dirty linen' in public.
I believe it is up to us to choose
what kind of Union we have,
but once we have chosen, and
the opportunity has been given
to us three times this year, then
we must be willing to show
people what we are like. We
should all be proud of our
College and Union. Chris
Crownshaw should be proud of
the R S M U and therefore only
too pleased that I am telling
people about it. I hope all of
you reading this are proud of
our College, I hope you will
thank me for spreading its good
name, indeed your good name.
And if you are not ask
yourselves why?
I am not washing our "dirty
linen' in public I am simply
flying our Union's flag.
Yours sincerely
Michael Newman
