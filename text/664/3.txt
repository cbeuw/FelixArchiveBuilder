Get off Your Arses
and Complain
The Refectory Suggestions and
Complaints Committee has
issued a plea for more corn-
plaints. The work of the com-
mittee is being limited by
students eating in the refectories,
according to chairman Gaynor
Lewis.
Each of the College's four
student refectories has a box on
the wall to collect the written
comments of customers. A l l
submissions made in this way are
considered by the committee,
which consists of student and
staff reps along with M r Victor
Mooney, Refectory Manager.
However the boxes, which arc
easily mistaken for larj/c nesting
boxes, have in recent years lost
their labelling and the convenient
paper and pencil which used to be
provided. This has resulted in the
committee's supply of complains
all but drying up.
Considering the usual quality
of food served in the refectories,
it seems that there should be
plenty to compain about. So
F E L I X issues an appeal to all
refectory customers—start corn-
plaining now and let's see the
suggestions boxes filled to
capacity!

A questionnaire has been sent out
by Union Internal Services
Chairman Hugh Southey to
other colleges around the country
to find out how their refectories
are managed. The sample was
chosen to give colleges with a
mixture of student union and
college run refectories with some
o u t l e t s r u n by o u t s i d e
contractors.
Replies to the questionnaire
are now being returned and are to
be used by the Union in
suggesting to the College
improvements in the running of
refectories, or even as a basis for
the Union managing its own
outlet. Early replies suggest that
whilst IC's refectories are some of
the worst in terms of food
quality, M r Mooney's financial
performance is rather better than
most from the College's point of
view, in that he is able to make a
slight overall profit.
The reply from the Bedford
College Union President, Miss
Delyth Morgan, was less than
helpful, however. She returned
the questionnaire, refusing to
complete it because the covering
letter from M r Southey began
'Dear Sir'.
N o S t a r W a r s
In an entertaining lecture given to
Wellsoc members on Monday,
Professor Geoff New of the
physics department convinced
his audience that laser and
particle weapons in space are
impractical as a solution to the
arms race. Even if it were possible
to build a suitable laser, simple
calculations show that to satisfy
its fuel requirements would take a
space shuttle trip per day for
many years. A single battle
station in a geostationary orbit
would not be effective because of
beam divergence, and therefore
about 150 stations in lower orbits
would be required. The system
could never be tested before use,
and even an unlikely 95% success
rate in shooting down missiles
would still allow hundreds to get
through. Countermeasures are
very cheap and easy to think of.
The deployment of laser wea-
pons would in itself be a very
provocative and destabilising act.
Superpower interest in 'space-
wars' research is driven not only
by military aspirations but by
economic, political and prestige
considerations, according to Pro-
fessor New.
B a r P r o m o t i o n s P i s s U p !
ICU Deputy President, Christine
Teller, has succeeded in persuad-
ing the Bar Committee to hold a
one week bar promotion. From
26 February to 3 March most
beers in College bars will have
their prices cut to 50p. The only
exceptions to this will be
Guinness, which will be sold at
60p, and the Guest Ales, which
will remain at normal prices.
Although Bar Committee is
still to finalise details, it is
planned that in addition to the
cheap beer other special events
will be organised. This may
include free food and free enter-
tainment.
The only thing that seems
unlikely to be changed is the price
of spirits. This is because re-
ducing the price of beer is seen as
the most effective way of boost-
ing bar trade.
Normally this period of the
year is a particularly poor one for
bars. This is because spring term
grants are beginning to run out
and academic work is beginning
to build up. However this week is
likely to be one of the busiest ever
as it coincides with Carnival, I C U
and C C U elections and several
other major events.
Flash in the Pan
A chip pan fire has left a flat in
the College's Lexham Gardens
head tenancy with an unusuable
kitchen. The fire, on Tuesday
evening, started when a resident
of the flat put the chip pan on the
cooker and forgot about it.
Returning later to the kitchen he
found the room full of dense
black smoke and burning oil all
over the cooker.
The fire brigade were called
and soon four fire engines were
on the scene.
The f i r e was q u i c k l y
extinguished, leaving the resi-
dents to clear up the smoke-
blackened room. There is consid-
erable damage to the cooker and
other electrics, and the walls and
contents of the kitchen were
completely coated with a black
residue.
The residents later enjoyed
their meal which had been
cooking in the oven, without
chips.
When asked if the food was
well done they said it was still a
little undercooked. One resident
was reported to have said 'It's
salads for us from now'.
OBITUARY
It is with regret that the Union
learned of the death on
10 January of Miss Phyllis
Trimmer, Manageress of the
Union Refectory for several
years.
ICU has given a donation to
Friends of St Thomas Hospital
in lieu of flowers in accordance
with Miss Trimmer's wishes.
