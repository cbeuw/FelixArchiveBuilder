NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
ESTATES CRUMPLED
IN IRONS FIASCO
As construction of a central launderette facility open to all IC students
progresses, it was revealed that no ironing facilities have been included in
the plans. The launderette, in the basement of Southside, is part of phase
1 of a scheme for the complete conversion of the area into student
facilities. In addition phase 1 includes a gym and changing facilities
which are also under construction. The preparation of a weights training
room in the Southside basement has also recently been completed.
Work began on 7 November Halls.
last year and the completion date
is 5 March. However the contract
is running 2 to 3 weeks behind
schedule, according to M r John
Lauwerys, College Senior Assis-
tant Secretary. It is hoped that
the time can be made up to enable
work to finish not more than a
week behind schedule.
The launderette will have ten
automatic washing machines and
four tumble dryers, and will be
situated in the former women's
toilets opposite the entrance to
the refectory in the basement.
There will not be any ironing
facilities however. It is envisaged
that laundries in the individual
Southside Halls will be converted
to much needed extra kitchens,
but that present ironing/drying
rooms will remain unchanged.
There will be no ironing facilities
for students not resident in the
The gym, primarily intended
for martial arts, etc, rather than
ball games, is to be formed from
part of the old refectory room on
the ground floor (above the
present refectory). Eventually it
is envisaged that other facilities
here will include a squash court
and table tennis room with men's
and women's changing rooms
and a sauna.
The final stages of the
conversion plan are still some
way in the future, but they
include a concert hall, billiards
room, and Union offices, as well
as the sports facilities mentioned
earlier. The provision of such
facilities, duplicating those
already in existence, will release
parts of the Union Building for
other uses. Quite what other uses
the College has in mind are still
unclear.
S T O P P R E S S !
Anti-porn campaigner Michael Newman has taken his crusade outside
College, it was revealed this week. M r Newman has written to 17
national newspapers giving details of events organised by R S M U such
as Hon Pornographers' Night and Mines Revue.
Already he has been interviewed by a reporter from the News ofthe
World and yesterday afternoon at 3:00pm the Sunday Express
contacted him to arrange an interview. It is not yet known whether
either paper will actually publish the story.
Both papers were attempting to contact R S M U officials yesterday,
but apparently without success. However, F E L I X contacted Mines
Vice President Tim Williams for his reaction. He expressed
amusement at M r Newman's antics and was not worried about
RSMU's activities being sensationalised in the gutter press. Mines
Union's position was, he believed, entirely defensible.
College Secretary John Smith was not aware of the developments
when F E L I X contacted him at 5:00pm yesterday. He commented that
anyone who read the News of the World was 'halfway to reading
pornography anyway'. He didn't feel that the situation regarding
pornographic events at IC was unusually bad.
