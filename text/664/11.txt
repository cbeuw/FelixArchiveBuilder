Hope ' ^ryone who went along
enjoy the bar games night.
The next big Guilds event is on
7 Feb, the 'Field Cup'.
For those who have never
experienced the event it involves
visiting many local establish-
ments (pubs) by solving cryptic
clues, in teams of 4 to 6 people.
En route you must collect
various treasure, eg a six foot
plank, a policeman's hat, etc.
So get a team together now,
and sign your names up in the
Guilds Office this week.
On Thursday we have a trip to
the Lazerium. This will cost
£1.75, although if more than
twenty people put their names
down in the Guilds Office it will
be less. Meet 6:00pm Guilds
Office.
Scout and
Guide
The Scout and Guide Club spent
last weekend in Snowdonia.
While Scotland was experiencing
lOOmph winds and driving snow,
the conditions in Wales were
quite pleasant.
The wind was strong and it had
uncovered some sheet ice, which
forced us to call off an attempt to
walk the Snowdon Horse-Shoe
Ridge, but the mountain was
climbed by other routes and both
the walking and the ice-climbing
were enjoyable.
Weekends in the Gower and on
Offa's Dyke are planned for next
month.

It's the Annual Dinner next
Friday night so anyone out there
who hasn't bought their ticket to
this event of the year had better
pull their finger out and grab one
quick from the office or officers.
The following Sunday we have
the Rugby 7s so anyone who
wants to win a barrel ought to see
Digby Holman, the 1st SV Capt,
or any member of the team.
That's about all, hope you
enjoyed the Aladin trip and the
barnight, and don't forget the
elections.
See you around.

This coming Thursday 2 Feb, at
1
1:00pm in Reed Lecture Theatre
:(Sherfield level 5) there is the first
major debate—with outside
speakers—of the year. The
motion is 'This House supports
Trade & Cultural Links with
South Africa'. Proposing the
motion is the Conservative M P
John Carlisle, who as a member
of the M C C , tried to stop the
government pressure on sporting
links with South A f r i c a .
Opposing is a former Imperial
College Union President Trevor
Phillips. He became President of
NUS and currently produces
Channel 4's minority programme
Black on Black. If you feel at all
strongly on this issue then come
and make a short speech from the
floor or ask a question. It's your
chance to make your point of
view heard.

Jazz Club
Jazz Club is back! Due to the lack
of a committee last term the Club
.was basically non-existent. How-
ever, the SCAB executive have
taken over the booking of the
Jazz Room where anyone can
practise playing their instru-
ments. Membership for the re-
mainder of the year will be £ 1 and
you will need a passport photo-
graph to get a membership card
which will be issued at IC Union
Office next Thursday 2 Feb. This
will enable you to hire the S C A B
PA system and book the Jazz
Room. Old cards will be useless,
by the way.
