IC Radio
and the Pirates
A n y o n e hoping to set up a radio station must
comply with H o m e Office regulations. The
H o m e Office rules for college stations confine
them to transmitting on medium wave and
f o r b i d t h e m to b r o a d c a s t o v e r c a m p u s
boundaries. This is easy to do in the case of a
campus university. A cable takes the signal
from the transmitter to the aerial, which is in
the centre of the campus. T h e signal strength
is adjusted so that there is negligible reception
at the boundary. A n d that's it.
In the case of an urban radio station, it's not
so easy.
IC Radio must not be picked up in the
M e w s or Exhibition Road. In order to be able
to broadcast at all, a 'leaky feeder' system was
set up in Southside and Linstead. A qualita-
tive explanation of this is quite simple.
All signal-carrying cables radiate. In the
case of a cable supplying an aerial for a
campus, the power required is 3 watts and
the signal from the aerial swamps that from
the cable. F o r the I C Radio 'leaky feeder'
system, the power is turned up to 2 0 W , but
there are no aerials. Instead, the cables are
arranged vertically, two in S o u t h s i d e a n d
one in L i n s t e a d , each the height off the
building. T h e I C R a d i o broadcasts c o m e
from these cables. M a t c h e d resistors o n the
ends of the cables stop the signals from
g o i n g a n y f a r t h e r . T h e f e r r o c o n c r e t e
s t r u c t u r e s of S o u t h s i d e a n d L i n s t e a d
actually help to confine the signal to the
b u i l d i n g s , a i d i n g r e c e p t i o n i n s i d e a n d
p r e v e n t i n g b r o a d c a s t s t o t h e M e w s
residents.
If you have a portable 'tranny' tuned to
301m M W and you are standing under the
arch in Southside near the entrance to the
refectory, y o u can pick up I C Radio, but if
you walk just a few yards towards the M e w s ,
the signal disappears completely.
It is interesting to note the effect that
Radio Caroline has had o n student radio.
W h e n I C Radio was set up, Radio Caroline
1
w a s b r o a d c a s t i n g f r o m a b o a t i n t h e
Thames. These broadcasts were relatively
weak, but because of Caroline's proximity to
Imperial, IC Radio were forced to change
their frequency to 301m M W . T h e Radio
Caroline boat then sank, but because of the
trouble it h a d caused, m a n y U n i v e r s i t i e s
w e r e a l l o w e d to set up their o w n legal
campus stations, and they were all given the
old Radio Caroline frequency.
N o w Caroline has been set up again, using
the same frequency and again on a pirate
basis, working from a boat. However, this
t i m e t h e y are u s i n g a p o w e r f u l l O k W
transmitter which can reach parts of Europe
and has completely d r o w n e d out all the
university transmitters which use the same
frequency. Radio Caroline's only comment is
that Caroline produces the sort of music
that students like, a n d so in their view
c a m p u s r a d i o s t a t i o n s are n o l o n g e r
required.
This is a lamentable attitude, as stations
such as IC Radio not only provide local news
a n d i n f o r m a t i o n , but p r o v i d e s t u d e n t s
interested in radio with an opportunity to
gain expertise in the field.

About
IC Radio
The idea that IC should have its j
own campus radio started in mid ,
January 1974. The problem was to
first persuade the Union and then
College to spend £1,500 to set the ,
station up. The IC Campus Radio
Society was formed in order to
campaign for the setting up of the
station.
IC Radio were not allowed by
the Home Office to use the
induction loop aerial system
employed at most other student
stations. The problem was that IC
is in the centre of London and
signals would be able to be picked
up off campus. In 1976 IC Radio
adopted a 'leaky feeder' aerial
system which complied with Homer
Office regulations. By December
that year, College allocated a
further £1,500 towards the setting ]
up costs of the IC Radio studios
and the installation of new lines.
This meant that they could
broadcast live from their studios |
which had previously not been
possible. O n the second of
December, 1978, medium wave
broadcasts began.
IC Radio is run as a club with
annual membership 50p. It is under .
no obligation to comply with the
views of the Union in any way—it
has unlimited journalistic freedom.
This sets it apart from other college
stations which are mere organs of ;
their unions, and have to toe the
line or have their grants cut.
To be trained as a D J for IC
Radio get in touch with IC Radio
Station Manager, Neil Collins or any
IC Radio member on internal 3440.
