Pavement Climb
Can you climb a pavement?
Yes, honest! This weekend R A G
are going to attempt the virtually
impossible, the incredibly
dangerous, the most reckless feat
ever undertaken. In pairs, tied
together for a modicum of safety,
your mission (should you choose to
accept) is to climb a completely
horizontal pavement, from the
Victoria and Albert Museum, along
Brompton Road, past Harrods, all
the way to Hyde Park. Yet more
tourists will again be deprived of
their cash as they are amazed by our
intrepid adventurers. All money
raised will go to the Royal
Association for Deaf People. The
perilous proceedings will cease
when we reach the Hyde Park Base
Camp for a massive picnic, so don't
forget to bring your rations!
Hopefully we will be able to
arrange some hot food to greet you
with too. There are prizes for the
best fancy dress and climbing gear,
and the charity are offering a C D
player for the best collector, so the
risks are worthwhile! Meet at Beit
Arch at 10.30am tomorrow
(Saturday) or come to the R A G
meeting at 1.10pm in the Ents
Lounge opposite Da Vinci's today
to find out more, if you are brave
enough to attempt the impossible!
QPR 2, Leeds 1, RAG £ 9 4 0 . 0 7
Last Saturday a group of 14 raggies
too lazy to get up at 8.30 to go to
Cambridge and too stingy to pay
£10 to get into a football match went
up to Leftus Rd and armed with
R A G Mags and cans terrorised both
sets of fans. This was all an attempt
to con them out of money for
M E N C A P and worked very well
(look at the score for yourselves).
Free lunch was provided by 'The
Sandwich Shop' - Gloucester Rd.
We collected for an hour and a half
before kick off, found ourselves

If you have already picked up your
sponsorship form, please get your
cheque for £38.50 (payable to ICU
front row seats and watched the
match. I thought it was quite good
but then the last match I saw was
England v France in February. If
you are interested in collecting for
a bit and then watching matches for
F R E E keep an eye on this space as
we hope to have many others
coming our way.
Top collector was Josh Burril
with £174.03 and top fresher was
Lynne Carter with £111.86. It's that
easy!

November. Forms are still available
if you don't already have one, and
the jump is free if you raise over
£100 in sponsorship.
Monopoly Revisited
Since the last issue of Felix more
money has come in, bringing the
final total for Monopoly to £4660.
Well done to everybody who
collected. The top seven teams,
who all received A - Z sightseeing
guides to London were: 'Norfolk
and Chance', 'Chuck and Chris',
'The Tarts', 'Lonely Hearts',
'Undecided', 'Mo, Steve and Rob'
and 'The Superteam'. The top
collectors also received bottles of
wine. Any members of the winning
teams who have not collected their
prizes yet should either attend the
Rag meeting on Friday in the Union
Lounge at 1.10pm or come up to the
R A G office any lunchtime.

Other people besides students help
ICU R A G collect money for
charity. The local community
around Kensington provide help,
services and prizes for R A G events.
Some of the places that have helped
R A G recently have been: Harleys
Pharmacy (near South Ken tube)
and Boots in Knightsbridge, who
provided films for Monopoly, Fast
Foto Centre in Knightsbridge Green
who processed them, The Sandwich
Shop and Fileric on Gloucester
Road who fed collectors at the QPR
vs Leeds, football game on Saturday
24th October. Further afield,
Nadia's Patisserie, Burger King
and Pizza Land in Cambridge fed
the Rag Raiders last Saturday.
Finally, Dunkin Donuts in
Piccadilly gave dozens of free
donuts to the Tiddlywinkers.
Thanks to all of them and any and
all who gave to Rag.
Rag Rocky Horror
Disco
Let your alter ego out.
Need I say any more? Maybe I
ought to for any uninitiated virgins
out there. Rocky Horror is a strange
musical film concerning transvestite
aliens from the planet Transylvania,
of the galaxy Transsexual, here on
Earth to deprave, corrupt and
entertain. We show the film, you
dress up in drag (if you want to) and
afterwards everyone gets down to
dance to such classics as The
Timewarp and Sweet Transvestite.
Don't worry if you've never seen
the film, turn up anyway. A night
of enlightenment and fun is
guaranteed. The venue is the Union
Building. Doors open at 7.30pm
and the film will commence at
8.00pm in both Da Vinci's and the
Ents Lounge. Disco starts at 9.30ish
in the Ents Lounge and the film will
be repeated all night in Da Vinci's.
Entrance is only £2 and there are
discounts for appropriate fancy
dress (stockings, suspenders,
basques, come on don't tell me you
don't know what drag means!) and
also for the day's courageous
collectors. Bring your waterpistols
along if you know what goes!
The Superteam.
