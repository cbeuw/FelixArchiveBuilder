Going
'We're here! Wow, a cold beer,
thanks you're a life-saver.' these
were the first words uttered by one
of the van drivers upon our arrival
at Brenda's caravan site in Port
Grimaud near St Tropez.
Fourteen or so IC Underwater
Club members had just descended
on this beautiful spot of the med for
some therapeutic drinking and
sunbathing, with diving thrown in
as a diversion. After driving non-
stop from London to St Tropez in
a Union Van and other vehicles the
driving teams needed the two weeks
ahead to recover for the journey
home, but I degress.
In the whole time there we only
had a day's rain so the
suntans/burns were quickly
acquired, for some of us even factor
15 ('Dulux emulsion') did not offer
protection.
We either ate out or barbecued
anything we could find, from fish
to aubergines. Handy hint for
lighting barbies quickly, even better
than petrol, use a diving cylinder,
however care should be taken with
the valve control, unless you want
to wander aound the camp site1
looking for the charcoal, food etc...
The diving in the region varies
from the good to the 'not bad' (the
latter is a phrase for great which
was used to wind up Jean-Noel).
For nature lovers the bay of St
Tropez offers ledges, walls and
other lumps of geography in and on
which wild life abounds, octopi,
scorpion fish, lobsters, edible crabs
and other yummie stuff, shame that
the place is a nature reserve and
thus the marine life lived to tell the
tale.
The sea bed in the bay is littered
with small wrecks; as we found out
when a pair of divers ignored the
Skipper (Phil 'the bottle' from the
'Club Equipe' diving centre) and
did not descend down the anchor
line. Thus missing the intended
wreck 'The Columbia' but had a
quiet dive on a completely different
wreck.
The Columbia kept causing
problems. As Doc. Bayley, our tour
organiser (Dive Marshal) found out
when he missed the wreck by being
only five feet away and not seeing
it due to the crap kicked up by
previous divers.
One note-worthy wreck that Phil
took us to was 'Le Rubis', a French
sub which appears at 20m down,
getting larger until one lands on the
deck at 40m. She is almost
completely intact, her mine laying
Conga eels and big blue fish??
bays are now the playing ground for
British sized Conga eels (1.5m).
Some of our more intrepid divers
entered the sub (one at a time)
through the conning tower. The
. 'Rubis' has not been plundered, so
gauges, big handles
(torpedo/batteries/mines?) are still
visible, since they are brass they
still move, but thankfully all
ordinance has been removed. I was
most impressed by the intact light
bulbs embedded in the rust of the
aft engine block.
However our diving was not
restricted to just Phil's area of the
coast, down the coast at Le Lavandu
resides the afore-mentioned Jean-
Noel, with his lemon yellow dive-
boat and Gallic sense of humour.
He waxed lyrical about the wrecks
in the area, hence the 'not bad'
comments given in reply to his
enquiries on how we liked the site
we just dived.
Admittedly the 'Conga Barge' is
worth a mention, as it is possibly
the best named wreck site ever. The
wreck lies at 40+m and is the home
and playground for a score of
congas. These beasts varied in two
major ways from our native eels.
One of these is that they are tame
and so don't stay in their holes, only
poking out their heads to scare
divers, these cute fish swim free;
the other difference is that they
dwarf most British congas, and
divers, by a few metres. As the
barge is their home the congas
expect the divers to either feed them
or move out of the way. We were
not prepared for this, so some fast
manoevring was required, handy
hint (number 2) leap-frogging
congas, due to their size and
number of pseudo-teeth' is only a
little less insane than leap-frogging
unicorns.
Off an island near the conga
barge lives another set of 'cuddly'
fish; giant Groupers. Imagine, if
you will, a perch. Now make it the
size of a large Pit Bull. The overall
effect is a fish big enough to
swallow whole boiled eggs and likes
to terrorise divers until it's fed.
At the end of this particular dive,
Rolf T am not insane, honest'
Tietema impressed the French with
his 'parachute', a boat signalling
device which looks remarkably like
an eight foot orange condom.
Rounding off our stay we
celebrated with a night dive in St
Tropez bay. As night diving
requires navigational skills I elected
to be shore cover, compasses and
I have come to the agreement that
if I don't use them, they will not
point me in the wrong direction (see
the Easter Tour report). Shore
cover means that I have to count the
divers in and out of the water and
explain to the locals, in my
'amazing'" French that the lights
they were seeing a hundred yards
out in the bay were mad English
people swimming at nine metres
depth and that they were not
harpooning everything in sight.
The return journey to London
went smoothly until Calais where
we had to wait for a Seacat. Once
onboard we thought it would be
plain sailing but noâ€”the tour was
to end with some 'humour'. The
captain announced that all
watertight doors had been sealed
and that we would be leaving
shortly. Half an hour later the call
came through that the 'bow visor'
was jammed and that tools were
being sent for from the shore (bow
visor = front cargo doors?). A
while later the restful sound of
sledge-hammers belabouring steel
was heard, followed some time later
by the announcement that the
damaged section of the Visor' was
going to be cut away. At this point
comments about donning diving kit
were overheard by the cabin crew
who, unsurprisingly, had a total
sense of humour failure.

with one of our divers who insists
that they have no teeth, if so they
carry the bluff off perfectly.

'amazing' because the locals
understood me.
