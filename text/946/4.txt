Opinion
30 October 1992 Felix 946
The truth about LSD...
Dear Jonty
Fed up with how predictable
everything comes to be? Tired of
seeing the same things the same
way? Been with the same
boy/girlfriend so long and feel it's
just routine?
No? Well, neither are we,
actually. We have to admit,
however, that we have found
immense satisfaction in a tasteless,
colourless liquid with no smell-
it's good old London water and it's
only been through seven other
people's kidneys (including, we
suppose, at some point, the kidneys
of the writer of the 'Beit Back'
article in Felix 944). If that doesn't
stimulate you, then try reading the
newspaper article published a
couple of weeks ago which
described how an eighteen-year old
'man' battered a five year-old girl
to death with a baseball bat under
the illusion that she was an evil
horde of skeletons following him.
Even if the L S D that he'd taken
doesn't fuck his mind, it has sure
fucked the mind of that girl, since
the skull is not known for its
resistance to high velocity impact.
That 'man' sure got a good trip—
to prison, where he now languishes
(or maybe he floats, if he was able
to get hold of some more LSD),
having been sentenced to life
imprisonment.
After reading the article in Felix
944, we got so enthusiastic that we
took our heads out of the sand and
buried them deep into the
Encyclopedia Britannica* to see if
it could tell us where we could
purchase some of this amazing fast-
learning drug (if only it was
available at the beginning of every
lecture, eh?). After ingestion of the
information contained therein, we
wondered why this miracle drug is
not available on every street corner
and in every chemist at rock-bottom
prices for consumption by the
general public. After all, wouldn't
it be a great comfort, as you wander
down Oxford Street watching pink
hippos and purple elephants
bouncing along on the pavements to
the sounds of Gilbert and Sullivan
gone mad, that everyone else is
sharing those selfsame visions?
Who needs virtual reality when you
can enter your own fantasy world
in real life and kill real people?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
The writer of the article,
nameless as he/she remains (for fear
of retribution by 'The System'—
George Orwell eat your heart out—
the police or large green moron-
eating monsters with huge batlike
yellow wings which can fly through
walls?) effectively 'withheld the
truth' all the way through his/her
article. These missing bits of
information, which are necessary
for any reasonable human being to
reach a balanced viewpoint, shall be
supplied below.
(Sceptics please note, these
quotes are direct from the
Encyclopedia Britannica.)
— ' A second important
aspect...involves a change in the
feelings and the awareness of the
self. The sense of personal identity
is altered...The person may feel
empty inside, or he may believe that
he is the universe...increased
suspicion of the motives of others
may also become a factor.. .at times
the mood shifts...there can be a
'hellish' (their quotes) terror, gloom
and a feeling of complete isolation.
For some people the experience is
so disturbing that psychiatric
hospitalisation is required' (our
italics).
-'Laboratory studies...linked
LSD to chromosomal and genetic
damage, thus intimating that future
generations of the L S D user might
be subject to the fearful issue of
malformation and genetic illness'
-'The user of LSD seems to have
an almost fanatic need to proselytise
(convert) others to drug use.' Does
this remind you of anyone? (Hint:
Real Felix issue 944).
-'There is also a tendency on the
part of those who take these drugs
(Hallucinogens) to repeat the drug
experience and to experiment with
other drugs.'
In summing up, we feel that Felix
has not only been used to satisfy the
needs of a few crazed LSD users to
proselytise, but as a jolly good
advert to inflict a potentially lathal
drug on underinformed and
unsuspecting freshers.
Yours,
Some concerned students.
P.S. We wish to remain
anonymous in fear of retribution by
'The System', the police and large
hash- (and God only knows what
else) smoking rugby players.

Too much truth? Islam—the real story
Dear Jonty,
At the beginning of your year of
office, you stated that you would
make every effort to persuade
authors of controversial letters to
put their name at the bottom. At the
same time, you are publishing 'Beit
Back', a regular anonymous
column, claiming it was in your
election manifesto. Quite how you
can justify encouraging anonymous
writing in one section of Felix while
discouraging it in another is difficult
to see.
Naturally, there are isolated cases
where anonymity is justified. On
the whole however an anonymous
column encourages misinformation
and lies. This point is clearly
illustrated by the content of last
week's 'Beit Back' article,
advocating the use of L S D . The
author claims he/she has not taken
the drug. Obviously it is something
else that is altering his/her
perception of reality. Perhaps it is
feelings of persecution brought
about by the diabolically oppressive
'system'? The author's suggestion
that even pure L S D (let alone that
available on the black market) is
harmless, is not only naive but quite
simply untrue.
Dr Raanan Gillon, director of
Imperial College Health Centre said
that although some people will be
unaffected after taking LSD, there
is a 'significant risk' of 'long term
mental disturbances' and long term
side-effects of a psychotic nature'.
We realise that the readership are
not so impressionable that they will
go out and take LSD en masse after
reading the article. The real damage
done, is that Felix and hence
Imperial College Union has been
seen to be promoting illegal
activities, despite any disclaimer at
the end of the article. Imperial
College Union IN N O W A Y
W H A T S O E V E R condones the use
of A N Y illegal drugs.
We understand that the idea
behind the article was to stimulate
debate, but would you initiate a
debate on racism by printing an
article representing extremely racist
views? Perhaps not the best tack!
We urge you not to neglect the
responsibility that accompanies the
power you wield as Felix editor.
It is the sensitivity of the subject
of drug abuse that has driven us to
write to you today, I suspect that
many of those who read the article
in question will echo our concern.

Dear Jonathon,
'Why are Muslims here, when
they disapprove so strongly of this
society?'
It is a sad fact that there is no
Islamic State anywhere in the World
today—even more sad than the fact
that most people are totally ignorant
of this, as so beautifully
demonstrated by M r Bailey in his
letter. For example, the way Saudi
Arabia is run has very little to do
with Islam. (That is not just an
opinion. It's a fact.) We cannot
expect those people to realise this
who see Islam as the 'Mad Mullahs'
and 'wreckless Bedouins' who are
given free publicity by the media
and who are about as represenative
of Islam as the British Royal Family
is of ideal family values. Muslims
have to choose between countries
run by 'Hypocrites', or countries
run by 'Unbelievers'. Not an easy
choice.
I do not support oppression of
either sex in any country, but a
good fluestion to ask about Western
socieites is: 'If women are supposed
to have such rosy lives here, then
what is feminism all about?'. I
wonder if M r Bailey supports
feminism, or is this something else
of which he says 'Who cares!'. But
that is another issue.
As for Salman Rushdie: in 'The
Satanic Verses' he said plenty to
enrage millions of people (but they
were Muslims). Mr Bailey was so
enflamed by what was said in such
a small article by the Islamic
Society that he started to call for
these Muslims to be sent to Iran.
And, I believe, this 'Nobby the
Sheep' article was banned, unlike
'The Satanic Verses'. So much for
freedom of speech! I'm not even
expecting this letter to be printed.
I have neglected to make a
defence of Islam by presenting its
principles. (It might have been too
detailed for the people I'd like to
read this letter.) Those who really
want to know should come to the
many debates and lectures arranged
specifically for this purpose by the
Islamic Society. Let sceptics see if
they can 'knock holes in Islam when
talking to real experts on the
subject. However, most people may
say 'Who cares' and go off to the
bar. They are happy to remain in
a state of ignorance, unthinking:
which is, perhaps, what the 'Nobby
the Sheep' article was all about.
Yours sincerely,
Amir Rehman Khan.
