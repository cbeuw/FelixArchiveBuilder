Meetings
If you were at the open meeting on
Monday, thank you for your input,
it was very useful. If you were not,
see you next week. We discussed
many, many interesting topics and
I, in all seriousness, gained a great
insight into peoples opinions.
Amongst other things; disaffiliation
from the University of London was
discussed; I hope to explain a bit
more about the effects this might
have in a future Felix, but please tell
me if you have any thoughts in the
mean time. We also had a brief
discussion on voluntary
membership, I found this very
informative.
More of the same next week, so
I hope to have the pleasure of your
company. I think the two above
issues will be continued, along with
any others you care to bring up.
Come in and see me anytime.

In Case of Voluntary
membership —break
glass
Prevention is better than cure; but
it may be neither possible or
desirable to prevent the introduction
of voluntary membership. The most
we can hope for, in my opinion, is
an input into how the process is
undertaken. It is safe to assume that
some sort of voluntary principle
will be undertaken. This assumption
is not only prudent but essential.
Preparation is the key. Our
masters have one hold over us;
quite simply this is funding, but in
most cases, they see this as money
well spent. It is essential to convince
our parent institutions of our worth.
We must be shown to be an efficient
and effective way to give our
students that elusive extra
'something' that makes the
difference between an average and
a good education.
How do we prepare?. In
preparing, we are changing; some
will have to change more than
others, but change we must. In
order to make the change effective
we must identify what we are and
what we want to become. We must
question our place in the lives of our
students, the role we have to play
in the scheme of higher education
and our relevance within that role.
(Here is the controversial bit) As I
see it, ideology has little place in a
modern students union, we must
instead concentrate on two things:
1) Making our students time at our
universities more enjoyable.
Through their courses, their social
life, their accomodation etc. 2) To
make our students more
employable, although if we do a
proper job of the former this will
follow.
In summary, we must look at
ways to become a customer focused
organisation. This may sound like
a 1980's guide to better business but
it's more useful then the manic
ramblings of a 1970's trade
unionist. Chris
