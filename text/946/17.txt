St Etienne—Avenue
Most bands these days are either
wannabe nihilists, wannabe
widdlers or token wankers, St
Etienne are a completely different
concept altogether.
When 'Join our Club' hit the
charts, they were hailed as anything
from new disposable SAW or meta-
pop cult heroes, either way they're
a bit of both really. John Locke
once wrote that ideas emanate from
perception and sensation—they
seem to know this implicitly.
Sarah Cracknell's fragile,
floating voice can be heard on
'Avenue', alongside its eclectic
ambience and ethereal nature. Yes,
it is airy pop but it has certain
heavenly influences like panpipe-
sounding flutes, tweeting birds,
what sounds like chanting Tibetan
monks, spoken Japanese and a sitar.
Excellent. Even has a sexily short,
sultry spoken section (oo-er!).
'Paper' sounds like a pastiche of
Velvet Undergound covers that
have been somewhat Etiennised.
Somewhere in this strange song
snippets of 'Heroin', 'Femme
fatele' and 'Rock and Roll' can be
heard—buy it and listen carefully.
What a great name for a song,
'Johnny in the echo cafe'—surging
noise interweaved with gushing
tonal textures creating an incredible
sonic sensation (wow!).
Haven't felt so light-headed since
Lovin' Spoonful's 'Daydream'.
Where did all the flowers come
from!
Enjoy St Etienne.
Enjoy their ambience.
Enjoy your mind.
Lucas.
• Out now on Heavenly/
Creation. Congratulations for
mentioning John Locke. Extreme
brainbox, apparently.
Shonen Knife —Ride the
Rocket ep
A track lifted from 'Pretty little
Baka Guy' album, released in 1988
or thereabouts. Not one of the finest
moments in pop history, but can
anything live up to the pure pop
perfection of tracks like 'Bear up
Bison' or T love Chokobars'.
Probably not.
On the flip is an instrumental, a
novel idea for a group that always
manages to be out of time and have
their guitars out of tune.

Sweet Jesus—UCL 24/10/92
I know you'll probably find this
hard, maybe even' impossible, to
believe, but the students at U C L are
worse than those here. Worse in the
sense that all the men seem to be
football/rugby players/fans and that
nobody seems at all bothered by the
low level of intellect employed in
conversation. That being said, who
am I to judge?
Sweet Jesus pout as well as can
be expected in front of a pretty
awful audience. They played what
I would think was a slightly dodgy
set, there seemed very little of the
exuberance I had witnessed before.
Rather damp. Even the satin shirt
seemed dull.

•Sweet Jesus release 'Albino
Ballerina7'Your Baby Loves Me'
on Monday through Chapter 22.
The Bardots, Passing
Colours, IC Union 23.10.92
The Passing Colours want to be
Ride. I don't blame them. Now
write a song called 'Taste'. Very
good. Now then, 'Twisterella'.
Great, 'Leave Them All Behind',
'Chelsea Girl'. Now then. Off to
the hospital, Mr. Leadsinger, and
get your face rearranged. Pouting
lips, and a big floppy quiff, much
sexier. Swoonsome, even, and that
bass player needs to go. Ride's not
a band for girlies. No. She's going
to have to go. Any takers (Calm
down, boys.) Besides, she can't
play, or sing, and we can't hear
Meat Beat Manifesto,
Eskimos and Egypt, Basti
ULU 22/10/92
I'm very confused.
The Basti that I remember were
a poppy group, they released a
record about Norwich City football
club. I also recall them being a
techno thrash group. Now you see
why I'm confused.
If I had to categorise them they
would certainly fall into the second
class. I also recall that they were
quite good, which I'm afraid still
confuses me.
Eskimos and Egypt are,
interesting. They would probably
be billed as an 'indie dance cross-
over' group. On vinyl they are
containable, restrained. Live they
produce a far more threatening
noise. 'Noise' is an unfair term. It's
Pulp-ULU 23/10/92
Once in a while there comes a
moment when you just have to wait
and see. When something holds
your attention so firmly that you
cannot turn away. One of those
times was tonight.
The lights dimmed and Jarvis
Cocker took the stage something
was defiantly in the air. Something
in his voice, or was it the velvet suit
that hung provocatively low, or the
'sex god' shouted out by a male
member of the cast. Us, as the
'audience', were gone. We were
part of it. Held mesmerised as
Jarvis pranced, strutted, paraded
around the stage. For what seemed
like an eternity the intro evolved.
And then it exploded into something
I find impossible to describe, the
shear magnificence is too much for
me. It would have been too much
for you as well..
What followed was a succession
of perfect pop songs. The flashing
star for a backdrop was forgotten,
the real world was gone. All that
mattered was Jarvis. A more
wonderful night out I find hard to
recall.

30 October 1992
you. You're boring.
It's the Glam district of
Strobesville here tonight. So let's
get it over with. The Bardots are
N O T 'The Best New Band In
Britain'. Suede, they've got the
emotional soul; Adorable, they've
got the best songs; The Bardots,
their lead singers got a tambourine,
and a penchant for the lyric 'It's
Alright'. Well, that's very nice
then. You're going to have to resit
the year. You've failed the test.
Kicked out of the class of '92. Not
bad for three quid, mind.
Lise Yates
not a monotonous din. There is a
definite sense that, 'Welcome to the
Future' is optimistic, that they enjoy
life.
Very loud, extremely loud,
untenably loud. Meat Beat
Manifesto. A good description.
Impressive. It's very hard to
describe. Maybe a second, or third
time through things would become
a little clearer, but as it is all I can
remeber is the noise. It wasn't just
a noise, more a complete absence
of silence, a feeling that there would
never be quiet again. I have a strong
feeling that I missed a lot, that all
the imagery that flashed across the
screens, the primeval rythmical
beats, all had so much to say.
Next time though, I'll pay more
attention.

The Shamen
single
•Boss Drum
'Bang to the beat of the drum, move
any mountain'. I remember when
it used to be rock-dance crossover
grass around here. You must
remember this, Mr. C , a kiss is just
a kiss. And I was about to say
something about really missing Mr.
C, when up he popped. There's a
very strange machine noise in the
intro. This record sounds like Snap.
'Activate The Rhythm'. It's
bollocks, it's rave, it's going to be
a(nother) massive hit. Amerika No
More.
