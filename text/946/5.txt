Point of Order
Dear Jonty,
My, such letters last week. One
in particular caught my eye, that
from Mike Castles of ICU Pro Life.
Mike mentioned the Irish
Constitution. Allow me to add to
the sum of human knowledge on
that one.
Mike says that the Irish
constitution accords equal rights to
the unborn child and to the mother.
This is indeed true. The English
translation of the Irish original,
which technically has no legal
standing in itself, reads:
'The State acknowledges the right
Aftertaste
Dear Jonty,
After reading Alan Bailey's letter
on 'Nobby the Sheep', I was left
with a bitter after-taste. Unlike M r
Bailey, I am in a better position to
judge the article in question. This
is because I am a Muslim and he is
a self-confessed atheist and
probably does not even have a clue
about Islam or what Islam means!
However, there were a few points
that I did agree on with Alan. When
I was handed the article, and I read
the title, the first thing that came to
mind was the soft lovable character
that comes on the children's
Saturday morning programme on
to life of the unborn and, with due
regard to the equal right to life of
the mother, guarantees in its laws
to respect, and, as far as
practicable, by its laws to defend
and vindicate that right'
This is all well and good, except
that the equal right to life of the
mother was only defined by this
year's Supreme Court judgement in
the X case. Before then, the article
was taken as guaranteeing the right
to life of the child above all else,
and with the mother as an
afterthought. Indeed, the thrust of
some of the abortion campaigning
ITV ('Ghost Train'). I really can't
see how the author decided to put
this title with his bizarre story. If
the author did intend, in good faith,
to put across moral points—then he
failed. I found the story to be quite
crude and it was an unsubtle
approach to change the reader's
way-of-life for the better. The
article must have been written some
time ago hence the opening
paragraph contained the word
'polytechnic' which is a thing of the
past now. The Islamic Society
should have at least read it once
before publishing it and so could
have realised how pathetic the story
Felix 946
in Ireland at the moment is to
increase the right to life of the child,
and to hell or Connaught with the
right to life of the mother.
Incidentally, in the last
referendum campaign in 1983, anti-
abortion campaigners said that a
raped girl would not be refused an
abortion. They lied then, they're at
it again this year. The December
3rd referendum is anxiously
awaited.
Keep up the good work.
Yours in the sunrise of

was.
I feel that the Islamic Society
should spend some time on
educating people like M r Bailey,
that Islam was one of the first
religions to give women rights. It
is not the fault of Islam that the men
in power such as in Saudi Arabia,
wish to misuse these rights. If M r
Bailey wishes to 'talk' about
civilisation 'then maybe I should
inform him that it was the West that
learned about chivalry and
civilisation from the Muslims in the
East.
Yours sincerely,
Miss S Ahmed.
Opinion
30 October 1992
Dear Jonty,
Can I firstly congratulate the
Indonesian Society for an excellent
food fair and cultural show which
they staged on Saturday 23rd
October in the JCR and Great Hall.
The amount of work and effort
which had been put in to arranging
the event was really impressive,
especially when one remembers that
this society was only started up a
few years ago (1990 to my
knowledge).
As always seems to be the case
with such events organised by the
overseas students in this college, the
number of home students present
was absolutely pathetic. At £4 a
ticket, the price was hardly
extortionate, considering the
portions of food and the quality of
the show.
In raising this issue at the Union
council meeting last year (during
my time as OSC Chairman) I was
told that home students may feel
inhibited to attend such events as
they beleive that they are solely
organised for overseas students.
Can I please stress that any event
organised by a society in the
Overseas Students Committee is not
just for us but also for you.
I hope all the home students will
in future show more interest in the
events we (and I am talking about
20% of the college) are trying to
organise. Who knows, maybe they
will actually find some enjoyment
out of it all.
Gaurang Chadha,
OSC Chair 1991-92.
