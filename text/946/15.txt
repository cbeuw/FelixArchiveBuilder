FilmSoc —High Heels Wine Tasting
This week FilmSoc presents High
Heels, directed by Pedor
Almodovar. The film stars Victoria
Abril (last seen in Tie Me Up, Tie
Me Down), Marisa Peredes and
Anna Lizaran, and is a complex and
sexy whodunnit, in the distinctive
styel of Almodovar. It is all about
the releationship between the
legendary pop star Becky Del
Paramo (Peredes) and her daughter
Rebecca (Abril), a T V news
presenter. Becky hasn't seen
Rebecca for fifteen years, when she
returns to Madrid to mount a new
show, and the two women become
destructively competitive of each
other.
Events take a bizarre turn when
Becky announces that she has
murdered her husband, live on
Huxley Soc
television. Becky and Rebecca's
characters are studied in some depth
during the film in a dark and
ingenious way but always with
humour and style.
If you enjoyed Tie Me Up, Tie
Me Down, are in the mood for a
psychologically rich thriller, or just
want to impress your friends by
going to see an 'arty' film (which
admittedly deals with adult themes),
then come along to Mech Eng 220
on Thursday 5th November at
7.30pm. Admission is a very
reasonable 90p for members £1.90
for non-members, and becoming a
member will cost you a mere £6.50,
with the first film free.
Note that the film is in Spanish
with English subtitles
HuxSoc is the Humanist Society at
IC, so what is a Humanist? A
Humanist says this life is all we
have and this world in which we
find ourselves is our responsibility.
A Humanist looks at the world and
tries to make sense of life without
depending on a supernatural force
such as God; but Humanism is more
than simple agnosticism or atheism.
As Humanists we try to say things
about values, search for meaning in
life and how to do the best for other
people.
We do not believe any religion
has a monopoly on morals, but that
human beings are resourceful and
intelligent enough to reach their
own conclusions through informed
rational discussion instead of
following outdated religious dogma.
For this reason the Huxley Society
organises talks and debates. On
Friday November 6 we will go as
a group to hear the Voltaire lecture
this year given by Richard Dawkins
(author of 'The Selfish Gene' and
'The Blind Watchmaker') who will
speak on 'religions as viruses of the

Once again the ICU Cross Country
team, depleted to 14 legs, braved
the cold, wind and far worse, at the
second event of the season at
Hampstead Heath University
College relays. As each relay team
has only 12 legs, IC had two legs
spare and made the insane decision
to enter two teams, the IC A-Team
and, with help from Bristol and Dr
Frank, the IC Mercenaries.
The Mercenaries came in a
credible 10th, with the A-Team not
to distant at 13th (despite our gold
star runner seeking alternative
mind'. We will leave at about
5.30pm to travel to Conway Hall in
Holborn, see notices nearer the time
for details.
We also hold weekly informal get
togethers on Mondays (starting 2nd
November) from 12.00, for coffee
at the secondhand bookshop in the
physics department.
On Thursday 29th October at
12.00 in the Union Lounge we will
have an introductory meeting with
free lunch where we will talk about
the aims of the society and our plans
for the coming year. We will be
showing a 20 minute video entitled
'Humanism the Great Detective
Story' sales of which were recently
boosted when it was damned by
Dame Barbara Cartland for
• 'destroying the last help for many
children by questioning the
existence of God'. There are still
many mysteries left to us and we are
constantly open to new evidence.
Humanism is not a finished system
of ideas or a set of fixed values.
Instead it bases human behaviour on
rational principles.

Dan Mortimer and Dave Knight
deserved extra large helpings of
chocolate cake for having four legs
and running twice. Best times went
to Dave Knight and Dr Frank and
worst to Paul Reah having lost his
way in the woods! Good efforts
were also made by Cedd Burge,
Dave Childs and Jake Orienteer in

Next race 4th November, but
keep a peephole on the noticeboard

On Tuesday 20th October,
following the roaring success of the
first introductory tasting night, the
ICU Wine Tasting Society held a
New Zealand evening, with wine
expert, Margaret Harvey.
Beginning with a rough
winemaker's guide to the island
down under (from the joys of
backpacking in the vineyards to the
problem of gaseous sheep used as
leaf pickers to the 'superiority' of
the fruitier New Zealand wines over
the slightly flabby Australians), we
then got down to the business at
hand - namely the tastings.
Tuesday was a good example of
a typical tasting selection - eight
wines in total, four white
(Chardonnay and Sauvignon
Blanc), three red (Pinot Noir,
Cabernet Sauvignon) and a sweet
white (Late Harvest Riesling).
These wines averaged a price of £6
a bottle, a vintage of about 1990 and
an alcohol content of 12% - not bad
for only £ 4 on the door!
Thanks also to ICU Industrial
Society for coming along (look out
for details on an end of term booze
up/tasting!). Any other clubs
interested in tastings should also get
in contact with us.
These informal meetings give you
the opportunity to ask questions,
become better informed on the
whole subject of wine (what is a
tanin?), and, most importantly, to
simply enjoy the wine! You may
become able to recognise grape
varieties by the colour, palate or
nose (we never say bouquet!) and
pick up prizes in the blind tastings,
or you may just find out what you
like about a wine and so take some
of the hit and miss out of buying
wines. Even if you never drink a
wine outside these weekly
meetings, everyone gets something
out of them. After all, what could
be better than getting drunk, with
a group of friends, and all in the
respectable name of education]
ICU Wine Tasting Society meets
every Tuesday evening in the Union
Building, starting at 6pm. Members
are entitled to a £1 discount on
every tasting (normal price £4) and
this term's calendar. Further details
may be picked up from the meetings
(the next being a New World vs
Old, 3rd November and College
cellars: Claret, 10th November) We
hope to see you there.
