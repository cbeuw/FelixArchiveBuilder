Private Eye Poetry Corner-
By Eric
This book from Private Eye,
Written by poets leading,
The way in truly awful poems,
Makes excellent toilet reading.
I for one have spent many a
happy hour,
Sitting on the proverbial throne,
Engrossed in reading the naff
poems,
That can be found in this small
tome.
But as a proper read,
Where you sit down and away
you go,
I can't really recommend it,
Humpty-dumpty-doe.
And when it comes to size,
It is a bit wee, And not cheap
too,
At four pounds and ninety nine
pee.
Still if you like the humour of
private eye,
Which I find just a little
esoteric,
Felix 946
That you could do worse than to
read,
These poems by the crap Eric,
J. Thribb (17 1/2) and Sir John
Betjeperson,
Most Worthy Poet Laureate.
This is a cheerful book,
Full of good nature rot.

The Student Vegetarian
Cook Book —Sarah Freeman
I wanted this to be my bible seeing
as I am both a student and a
vegetarian, but I did not find it any
more useful than any of the other
30 vegetarian cook books on my
shelves.
This book doesn't appear to have
achieved its aim of offering
interesting and cheap food ideas for
veggie students. Under the 'When
you're really broke' section is a
recipe for 'Avocado and pear
potato' which includes such
inexpensive ingredients as olive oil,
wine vinegar, yoghurt cheese,
avocado etc. In general there are far
too many recipes which rely on
spinach! The author also expects
students to have a rather well-
equipped kitchen - one can never be
without one's pestle and mortar!
My biggest gripe is that it is too
preachy, and falls into the trap of
thinking that you are a Veggie", so
you must be a health freak. For this
reason all the recipes are
disgustingly wholesome and the few
pudding suggestions are made as a
seemingly grudging addition. I'm
sorry, I'm a vegetarian but I like
chocolate ( and doughnuts and
flapjacks and creamcakes..)

Zen in the Art of Climbing
Mountains — Neville
Shulman
Picture this. There's this guy with
a Zen fixation who decides to climb
a mountain (Mont Blanc). He has
no previous experience and must
join with a team to help him achieve
this death defying feat where life is
not only in the hands of the elements
but also in the ability of your fellow
climbers. N O THIS IS N O T
FICTION.
How would you feel as one of the
team?
a) There's a nut trying to kill me
or b) There's a weird nut trying to
kill me.
Now the book doesn't really
explore this, but rather it
concentrates on Neville Shulman's
battle against the mountain and
relates it to the trials and traumas
of everyday life and how to
overcome it/them by the
implementation of Zen.
My problem is that although I
would love to achieve a serene state
of being or whatever I find his
repeated use of Zen philosophy a bit
like reading Watch Tower.
It's not that I hated this book. I'm
sure there is Zen in all of us. I did
feel a certain affinity with some of
the 'awareness' (my old school
teacher would tell you that this has
nothing to do with Zen, more with
me being on another planet in the
first place). Certainly I could relate
to the simple number mantra having
done it myself and never realising
it had Zen connotations. It's just
that I kept imagining myself as one
of the other climbers whose whole
philosophy is more one of the
pragmatist.
Enlightenment is once more
travelling on a bus going in the
other direction and the sceptic in me
wins again.
P.S. He did make it to the top.
