The first U A U is always shakey,
especially when you're playing the
strongest team in the group; the
team who beat you 5-1 last year.
Still we're an optimistic lot in the
hockey club.
It's hard to be optimistic when
you're 0-1 down after five minutes.
The IC Phantom curse had struck
again. The first ten minutes of the
new half found us only loosely
moored to the game. An attitude of
forgetfulness set in. Who was
marking that centre-forward? Still
after they had had another goal
disallowed, we found our feet and
began to behave like a team. The
defence was pretty solid at least.
Half-time saw more dominance in
the centre of the field. Still not in
their 25 but we were getting there.
Of course this ignores the fact that
Reading had hit the post once and
our 'newspaper celeb' Dave
Parkinson had saved two short
corners on the line. O K , they also
had sneaked another goal in.
Finally the hard work paid off
and Mark Helayel struck a shortie
firmly into their goal. 2-1 Hooray
IC the comeback (almost). Still we
gave it our best shot; it's Kings next
week.

IC R F C 1st 26 Kings 3
IC rediscovered their winning form
at Harlington on Wednesday, where
they duly dispatched Kings College
meagre challenge by winning 26-3
On a damp, windy day they took
charge in the forwards , admirably
led by Rupert Carr, the vice
Captain. Kings took an early lead
after Andrew Montgomery had
aslight tete a tete with the referee,
resulting in Kings kicking on their
only points.
IC hit back straight after the
restart with a penalty, soon to be
followed by a further three from the
immaculate boot of Stuart Paynter.
IC R F C 2nds-10 Kings 2nds 26
IC Seconds suffered their third
defeat in a row with a 10-26 loss
against Kings College at Harlington
on Wednesday afternoon. After a
rough start to the season, playing
two quite experienced sides, with a
team consisting of mostly
newcomers to ICRFC, the 2nds are
now starting to gel together more
under the guidance of their captain
Rich Clemey.
This week's game started off very
Dribs
The Dribblers started well and
dominated the beginning of the first
half with some good passing and
control in the midfield and attack.
Our only goal was scored by
Betty after a brilliant run up the
centre, round their defence and a
well timed shot into the back of the
net. Not bad for a first timer.
It was a tough match, their
defence were excellent and although
the scoreline looks very decisive it
doesn't reflect the closeness of the
game. The ball actually spent the
majority of the time in the
oppositions half, honest!
Well done to everybody that
played. There's a presentation of
last year's league medals in the
Ferret and Firkin tonight,
everybody's welcome.
The match began on a sombre
note with one minutes silence in
respect of M r Geoffrey Eldridge
who died recently. He was a well
respected referee who will be
greatly missed.
The Dribblers play their first
international match on 4th
November, at Harlington, against
a Canadian team. Please come and
support us.
IC extended their lead with the
first touchdown of the season,
provided by Richard Stubbs,
minutes before the Interval. The
conversion was a formality.
After the break and playing into
a strong wind, IC held their
opponents out, before surging
upfield with Melvin Aguh who
replaced Andrew Montgomery,
who left the field because of a groin
strain soon to be followed by Anton
Fields with a hurt knee. Paynter
slotted the conversion to complete
the scoring and IC's first win of the
season.
well with a good drive and a
converted try in the first five
minutes. Kings, unfortunately came
straight back with a score and
controlled the game from then on.
It was a disappointing loss but a
hard game well fought until the last
whistle.
IC Rugby meet every Sunday at
12.30, Monday at 6.00 and
Tuesday at 12.00 in the Union
Gym, all players are welcome.
Volleyball at IC
Despite rather poor public relations,
volleyball is alive and kicking at
Imperial College, providing
possibly the best example of
excellent athletes not being
competent organisers. Last season
IC was victorious in seven
consecutive matches in the U A U
volleyball competition, only finally
succumbing to Early Sunday
Morning Blues at the Semi-finals
stage against a less flamboyant
Manchester side, which had
obviously spent less time on a
thorough investigation of the Exeter
night life the previous evening.
Even our veteran Hans Bavendiek,
who was later considered to be the
backbone of the British Universities
team found the hour did not befit the
occasion and did not display the
relentless offence that had put and
end to the ambitions of all other
opposition. Imperial then threw
away the bronze medal against a
team they had beaten easily the day
before.
Imperial players also formed the
backbone of the U L U teams, taking
four of the six full purples awarded
for volleyball this year. This was no
mean achievement, given that after
a very convincing gold medal at the
Students Cup in Leeds, the London
men's squad has been described as
the strongest university side Britain
has ever seen. The squad's strength
was further underlined during the
BUSF tournament, when three
players could not attend, including
IC captain Joel Ikdal and Swiss
senior and Czech junior
internationals Yves Cortellini and
Stepan Ruzicka, but the team still
managed a resepctable 4th place,
while the women took the bronze
medal, captained by IC's Kristina
Sagen.
Trials will be held in the Imperial
College Volleyball court (behind
Chemistry) from 7pm-9pm on
Monday 2nd November. Training
will start with two sessions a week
for the ambitious and a casual
session for recreational players. The
season this year will get underway
with the first round of the U A U
competition on the 24/25
November. If you want any further
information, please don't hesitate to

Joel or Peter).
