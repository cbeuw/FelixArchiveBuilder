One thing you can say about Sir
Eric Ash is that he has a certain
sense of style. Announcing, that
Imperial was considering opting out
of the University of London is
guaranteed to bring the College into
the full glare of publicity.
Unfortunately the all powerful
ones didn't tell us, in the rush to
make sure that every national
newspaper had a copy of the speech
before it was delivered. Did not
warn us about our removal from the
largest University in the country,
while the Independent had a
photographer there and three
quarters of their second page
already written. Surely, this sort of
decision could have had a bit more
discussion without the principals of
LSE, U C L and Imperial carving up
the London University amongst
themselves.

Whoever wins best student
Newspaper of the year, it will
always be controversial but this year
it is particularly well deserved.
London Student,have put blood,
sweat and tears into the successes
of last year. And, I have every
confidence that Mike Herd will
build on the results of Louise
Clarke, last year's editor, and I
wish him well.

A lot of people don't like me.
That's fine by me, but I put a limit
at sticking bombs in my
neighbourhood. O K , so the two
IRA bombs in the Hammersmith
region, N O V O T E L and T . A .
Centre, weren't destined for me,
but the fact remains they were
there. Two hours before the bomb
exploded, I walked in front of the
very location of the second bomb
on my way to get a pint of milk and
some yoghurt. I like yoghurt but I
would rather not risk my life
everytime I feel the craving for
some. This is not some rumbling
about whose right or wrong in
Ireland, everybody has their
opinion about this problem,
everybody is free to express it and
many people do. This is about how
to express it, or rather how not to
express it. A large majority of the
world's population is unhappy
about something, in fact I would go
so far as to say all of us have
something to be pissed off about.
I'm pissed off about the new college
working hours, that does not give
me the right to napalm the Rector.
We have all gone beyond
reasonable behaviour under the
influence of anger, anyone who
claims they haven't have been
stifling their lifestyle. Anger is part
of self-preservation, it is a steam
outlet and occasionally the steam
scalds other people. But this is still
no excuse to use dynamite as a way

to express yourself. There is not just
a difference in scale between a
punch in someone's faces and a
bomb in Northern Ireland, there is
a difference in attitude. When we
reach a problem the scale of that in
Northern Ireland there are
democratic ways of expressing
yourself, there are acceptable ways
that don't involve spreading the
blood of other people on pavement
stones, ways that don't involve 12
year-olds throwing stones at
policemen and policemen shooting
back. You see, I realise that both
sides have been at fault and the IRA
can't take the full blame for all the
violence. I realise that in all cases
where terrorism is used there are
two sides of the coin. I also realise
that terrorists think they can justify
murder, and that is what frightens
me. Call me selfish but I don't want
to die because the Basques want
their land back from France, the
IRA want Northern Ireland to go
back to the Irish or Red Action is
generally disatisfied with life. I
don't want to see my friends in
hospital beds because some people
think this is the only way they can
get heard. I don't want to see my
family buried because they went to
buy yoghurt (I mean, what has
yoghurt ever done to anybody?). I
also want problems to get solved.
But if things were that easy they
would have been solved a long time
ago. So, members of the IRA, of
Red Action, of the E T A , terrorists
of the world, if this document ever
reaches you, if you must remember
just one thing from it; it would irk
me to die just because your public
speaking skills are limited.
