Knife story
Further information has been
received about the knife attack in
Linstead Hall on Friday, 15th
October.
According to the victim, the
attacker was the friend of an ex-
boyfriend. The victim believed that
the reason for the attack is that the
attacker held a jealous grudge
against her. A few days before the
attack, the man came to Linstead
Hall uninvited. He was asked to
leave by the victim after he made
unwanted physical advances.
On Friday evening, the victim
says that the attacker walked into
her bedroom while she was visiting
the room of a friend, having left her
door unlocked. Later on when she
returned to her room, she was
immediately held at knife-point.
The knife was held against her face,
causing a large cut and bleeding to
occur. In her own words; 'He
pushed me, something hit my head
and after that everything went
blank'.
The victim was found about half
an hour later, unconscious, by a
friend. The friend says that she
called the sub-warden and between
them they revived her. A doctor
from IC Health Centre was called.
After examining her he said that she
had a bump on her head and a cut
on her face, but no other injuries.
Having said that the cut was not
very serious, he asked her to see

College Security is stressing the
importance for students to look after
their electronic security
'Swipecards'. Many students have
been reporting lost cards long after
losing them. Others have not
formally reported the losses at all.
This is causing a lot of
inconvenience as entry of students
Chris meets students
him the following day.
On going to see him, however,
she was told by the doctor that he
could now see 'a larger number of
cuts' on her face since the previous
day. The girl alleges that the Doctor
implied that she had inflicted the
wounds on herself. He, reportedly
said he did not believe there had
been any attack at all. He also
offered her professional help as he
'believed her to be troubled'. He
maintained the same story in his
statement to the police, also denying
the fact that she had had a bump on
the head.
The friends of the girl, however,
insist in their statements, that she
was accompanied at all times for the
remainder of the night. Therefore
she would not have had any chance
of wounding herself.
Reasons for this change of
attitude of the doctor is considered
to be part of a security cover-up.
Attempts have been made by Felix
reporters to obtain a statement from
him. (The doctor cancelled an
appointment with us and all
attempts to interview him whilst
researching this story have failed.)
College security state that they
believe further police investigation
is taking place. Security guards
have now been returned to Linstead
Hall, from where they were
removed in last Easter's security
into departments cannot be
controlled. Students are strongly
requested to take better care of their
cards. In the event of any loss, the
security dept. must be informed
immediately. Reports should be
made to room 150 in the Sherfield
building or call Ellen on extension
6999.
Chris Davidson, I C U Union
President, held his first informal
meeting with students last Monday
(26th October).
Mr Davidson expressed his
intentions of increasing
communication between students
and the Governing Body. After
giving a brief description of his
activities over the previous week,
he encouraged the students present
to ask questions and express
opinions about certain issued. Many
questions were raised on how the
Union is run. Jonty Beavan, Felix
Editor and sabbatical, was present.
Other sabbaticals will also be
present at future meetings.
The likelihood of having a
voluntary membership system and
the probability of an independent
'Imperial University' was also
discussed by M r Davidson who
intends to write in more detail about
the latter, including the pros and
cons in future issues of Felix.
One student raised the subject of
rights for mature students. M r
Davidson showed interest and
would like to hear more opinions on
this subject.
Future meetings will be held
every Monday from 1pm to 1.30pm
in the Ents Lounge of the Union
Building. A l l students were
encouraged to attend and voice their
