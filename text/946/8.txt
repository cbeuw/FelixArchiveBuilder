London in the Summertime
Adam Tinworth tells the sorry tale of students trapped in rented
accommodation over the long summer vacation.
T'm bored,' whined Guy, 'Bored,
bored, bored, bored.'
I looked up from the book I was
failing to read and gazed out of the
semi-opaque window. The dull grey
light bathing the East End battled
against the months of grime, and
eventually gave up dispirited.
'It's still daylight,' I commented,
desparately hoping I had guessed
right, 'We could still go and do
something before Brian comes
round.'
'Yeah, like what?'
'Well, Carver's always busy, ask
him.'
'Carver, in case you haven't
noticed, isn't here. His Giro
arrived, and so he's gone off to
score. And even if he was here,
he'd only be getting doped up,
shagging Rachel or reading Lord of
the Rings for the umpteenth time.
Whoopie-do.'
'You could revise for your resit.'
'Hmmph.'
'Well?'
T'm going for a fag.'
I watched Guy take up his normal
position perched on the wall at the
front of the house, sucking hard on
the cancer stick. The summer
holidays were really getting to him.
Of the people we knew in London,
virtually none of us had found
work. Admittedly, one
acquaintance had found himself a
reasonably successful career as a
male prostitute in a brothel, but
that, to be frank, was not an option
that appealed to many of us. Bar a
brief week Adrian had spent
working for an accountant, none of
us had managed to earn a penny
since term ended. One way or
another, we were scraping by
financially, but the biggest problem
was boredom.
Carver had been the least
affected, having spent the last year
doing absolutely nothing and he
seemed intent on doing even less in
the year to come.
'Well, if I can, like, get through
the year O K , Patty will have
graduated, and she'll like set up her
hippy commune, right? It'll be,
like, the bollocks. Really easy,
like.'
'Haven't you noticed, Carver?
They're saying that they're going to
Three people trying to sneak up on
a phone box is not a common sight,
but this being the East End, it's
usually better not to know.
clamp down on New Age Travellers
and errm...like, no pun intended.'
'Yeah, but we won't be
travelling, right? No Travellers, no
problem?'
'Errm...'
T don't really think it's a
problem, which ever way you look
at it,' muses Adrian, lifting his head
from the style pages of the latest
Go. 'The Government might say
that they're going to clamp down,
but do you really think the civil
servants in the dole office are going
to be able to? I mean, don't they
have enough to do already?'
'More every month,' I comment.
'The recession's on you know, and
not everyone's rich enough not to
care.'
'Hey, it's not as if I don't care.
For the unemployment figures to
come down, the recession's got to
ease, hasn't it?'
'Yeeees...?'
'Well, unemployment is a cost we
pay to lift us out of recession, so it
will, eventually cease to be a
problem in of itself, so why worry.'
He leans back with that certain air
of smugness that only Kenneth
Baker has ever really mastered,
leaving Carver looking confused.
'Does that mean I'll get the dole
or what?'
'Filthy scrounging layabout
trash.'
The phone rings. We all make a
dive for this brief flash of
excitement that has entered our
lives, but Guy gets there first.
'Hello, Clowns for Crime Inc.,
Bozo speaking. How can we help
you?'
He looks down at the receiver
with astonishment.
'They hung up.'
'Oh, big surprise. What if that
had been important, you plonker?'
'Yeah? Who important is going
to be phoning you Adrian? A
woman?'
That was nasty - Adrian's last
girlfriend had dumped him only a
couple of weeks before, for reasons
he wouldn't explain, but which
were rumoured to involve constant
demands for activities David Mellor
is known to have enjoyed. His
shifty reaction is enough to tell us
