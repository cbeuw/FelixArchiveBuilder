Balloon —Tightrope Walker
Single
Balloons float. On the other hand,
tightrope walkers are gravitationally
challenged. One sHp and it's
homeward bound—bump!
Unfortunately both natures are
displayed in this record.
The basic step-up is quite (dare
that word be used) nice. Vaguely
celtic-folky celtic-folky
arrangements of fiddle and
harmonica are tightly structured and
not intrusive. The strummy guitar
and vocal pastiche neatly interlink
in a pleasant kind of way. The
balloon slowly floats upwards.
But that's about as far as it goes.
Nothing terribly exciting happens;
the tune plods along and the lyrics
get progressively more Lewis
Carrollish.
'Trust to my lucky dice, my
trusty pocket knife, high in the
chandelier, hang for all to see...'
Come on guys, try a bit harder
please. Our balloon has started to
leak air and drift in the thermal
currents.
The other two tracks are better,
more focussed, but still it's all a bit
atmospheric and well, dull. A quick
burst of Helium wouldn't go amiss
I fear. Bland.

The Poorboys —Brand New
Amerika, Single
They have long hair, are really
cool-looking and come from
Southern California. Their music is
mere hard rock & roll, they could
be little brothers of the Black
Crowes. Their words are hardly
understandable, something about
crack-dealing schoolkids ('Brand
New Amerika') and some irrelevant
relationship fuss (the two other
tracks), but who cares anyway.
There is honestly absolutely nothing
revolutionary or exciting about the
Poorboys ('cept for maybe their
spelling of 'Amerika'), it's all been
there for eternity.
But I like it.
Yes, as long as there are
androgyne megastars only able to
give a concert with the electricity
consumption of a small town and as
long as my heart and soul are
assaulted by machine gun computer
rhythms every time I enter a disco,
there shall be hand-made, dirty,
simple, groovy rock 'n' roll like
that of the Poorboys, be it heard a
thousand times before or not. If they
only had something meaningful to
say, I would love it. Maybe they
can find something for their next
record.
Until then: Keep on rockin' in the
brand new Amerika!

Kingmaker. What are they so happy about?
Kingmaker—Armchair
Anarchist
It is difficult to imagine that just a
few months ago, this band were
being hailed as the brightest hope
for the future. British music,
because this EP is really BORING.
This is the first time I've heard
anything by Kingmaker, so perhaps
I was expecting a little too much;
however, even if I wasn't expecting
anything I would still be
disappointed with this record.
The song 'Armchair Anarchist' is
kinda snide and sneering but it's
clever-clever lyrics don't really do
anything and the choruses 'Bomb
the idiots, bomb the idiots now',
and 'Viva dynamite, viva dynamite
O H ! ' sorta hint at right-on-ness but
it's all a bit contrived and tame.
The music is probably even less
noteworthy than the lyrics—all
pretty much standard indie guitar
music, I guess. There's some nice
chordy-jangly bits (oops, lapsing
into muso-jive there, sorry) here
and there, but it's all pretty
forgettable stuff.
The second song is called
'Everything's Changed (since
you've been to London)' which is
all about the supposedly corrupting
influence of our beloved capital. I
think they're just pissed off 'cos
they live in Hull!
The last song is called 'Kissing
under anaesthetic' which should be
called 'Listening under anaesthetic'
because you'd love to be knocked
out to enjoy this record.
Music to snore to.

Metallica — Wembley Arena
25.10.92
The world's greatest heavy metal
band hits Wembley for the first
proper British date since when—89?
Too long ago anyway.
This is the bit where I describe
the support band. Except that there
was none. We've heard limp
excuses like 'Well, Skid Row and
Faith No More are the only hands
good enough, and they're too busy'
but so what?
Why not give an up-and-coming
band a chance to reach a larger
audience then?
Instead, we get around twenty
minutes of a crap video
rockumentary (i.e. drunken
American fans being stupid) before
Ennio Morricone's music from
'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'
heralds Metallica's arrival on
stage—where they would still be
some two and a half hours hence.
Openers 'Enter Sandman' and
'Harvester of Sorrow' sounded
weak—perhaps the lack of support
band resulted in a lack of
atmosphere and energy for the band
to feed on (man)?
With 'Creeping Death', however,
the black-clad foursome were in
their stride and, indeed, playing a
blinder. Tighter than I have ever
heard them, in fact, despite this only
being James Hetfield's second show
as guitarist since he incinerated his
hand on stage some months ago.
Jason Newstead's bass solo was
a predictably tedious affair
involving fuzzy bits and whale
noises. Lars Ulrich, obviously fed
up with the drummer's traditional
stationary role was able to race
around on his mobile drumkit with
all the speed and grace of an
arthritic tortoise, but thankfully
there was no drum solo.
Kirk Hammett managed to avoid
the symptoms of guitar solo tedium,
basing his solo around Deep
Purple's 'Mistreated' whilst still
having fun kicking his guitar down
the stairs. Infinitely better than the
ten minutes of high-speed wanking
I was expecting.
'Seek and Destroy' was an
interesting singalong extravaganza.
'Fade to Black' and 'One' were art
in its highest form and 'Whiplash'
and 'Last Caress' were pure
energy. If I have seemed negative
about any individual parts of the
evening, here are some of the
superlatives I missed out:
Choice, fine, rare, felicitious,
excellent, admirable, first-rate,
prime, crack, cardinal, superfine,
super-excellent, exquisite, high,
inestimable, incomparable,
transcendental, matchless, peerless,
inimitable, but perfect? Maybe not,
but perfect would be boring.
