Glengarry Glenn Ross
The recession is biting; jobs are on
the line and Jack Lemmon, A l
Pacino, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris
are going to do all it takes to pull
through. Run down 'Premier
Properties' is on the way out along
with most of its fading ennuid staff.
Enter bastard boss to whip them
into a frenzy with the news that all
but the top two salesmen will lose
their jobs by the end of the month.
Panic, desperation and the
claustrophobic intensity created by
the stage to screen transfer elicits.
Some stunning acting from the
smooth seductive sales ace Ricky
Roma (Pacino) to the shambling,
soft touch Shelly 'Machine' Levine
(Lemmon) all stops are out. The
film fluctuates from banal and
repetitive to crackingly gripping.
Though more play than a film, and
in the present climate, a very
depressing one at that, see it for the
acting. (The recovery's just around
the corner, you know—Major Ed.)

The Two Gentlemen of
Verona
This Shakespearean comedy is the
tale of two friends, Valentine and
Proteus. While Proteus remains in
Verona, held by his love for Julia,
Valentine travels to Milan where he
falls in love with the Duke's
daughter, Sylvia.
Proteus is sent to Milan by his
father. There, he instantly forgets
Julia and sets out to betray his friend
by seducing Sylvia.
The play has been updated and is
set in the 1930s where the
atmosphere created is both
sophisticated and fun.
Portrayed in this era, the action
is extremely easy for the audience
to relate to. It is set to a delightful
array of Cole Porter songs which
you'll find yourself humming for
weeks.
This play is worth seeing for one
character alone. An apathetic dog
called Crab who outshines all the
other actors and is truly hilarious.

Concert
The Borodin Quartet
The Borodin Quartet has blessed the
musical world with its unique blend
of virtuosity, insight and
unparalleled beauty of sound since
1945. Violist Shebaldi and Cellist
Berliusky are the originals and
though in their seventies, play with
an undimrned youthful vitality and
lightness missing from the newer
violinists Koplman and leader
Abramenkov. Opening with
Beethoven's intense F minor Op 95,
skill, experience and concentration
breed an ease which carried the
three Allegro movements to
sparkling heights. The lyricism of
the final Larghetto-Espressivo was
breathtaking. A n inspired
programme lead to Shostakovich
No. 13 in B Flat Op 138. A
potential nightmare in many other
hands, discords and tonal lunacies
flourished into witty, wonderful
sound pictures and electric rhythms.
The Schubert of the second half
(D804 in A minor and D707 in C
minor) lacked restraint. Complacent
ensemble playing, dynamic surges,
unnecessary glissandi and
misplaced, mannered, soloistic
flourishes from the leader showed
the sugar-sweet writing at its worst.
That aside these are masters of their
craft, catch them next time, this is
the stuff of music history.

Our Song
Following the success of Jeffrey
Bernard is Unwell, Peter O'Toole
(leading), Ned Sherrin (directing)
and Keith Waterhouse (writing) are
attempting another profitable
collaboration. This is not a good
idea. The play charts the course of
an affair between Roger Piper
(O'Toole) and the considerably
younger Angela Caxton (Tara
Fitzgerald) and the resultant havoc
it causes to Piper's marriage,
career, finances and liver until its
inevitable end. The first attempts at
rather brittle comedy, but the jokes
(inevitably about sex) are old and
weak. The second half is better and
is partially successful in delineating
the intensity on both sides of the
relationship. O'Toole gives a nice
performance as a louche, middle-
aged drunk; but it is all artifice and
no feeling. Performing is too much
in evidence. He also wears the
nastiest suit I have seen in a long
time. In total, it is a disjointed play
about squalid characters who never
succeed in engaging interest.

Artists & Admirers
The talented but penniless young
actress Alexandra Mikolavia
Negina has to struggle for
recognition as her rich and
influential admirers scheme to
wreck her career after she has
rejected advances by their most
prominent member, Prince
Dulyebov. But, thanks to a keen and
calculating merchant rather than
Alexandra's fervently idealistic
fiance (a student), art wins over
corruption.
Anyway, more interesting than
the somewhat disappointing plot
were the dramatis personae:
amiable, witty theatre-types, a
student and an uneducated bunch of
aristocrats, nouveau-rich and
government officials. Ostrovsky's
strength is characterisation and
dialogue, which is well preserved
in the new English version. This
and the superb acting on all parts
save the production. Obviously an
important figure in Russian
literature, but unlike Chekhov's, his
plays have lost a lot of their impact
over the last hundred years. Every
Russian does him at school, and
everybody finds him boring,
basically.
