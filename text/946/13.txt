G Ingram and M Phylactides write oftheir experiences ofthe UROP scheme
in the University of Delaware last summer.
This summer we were in Delaware
(Delawhere?), USA, as exchange
students in the College's UROP
scheme. Basically, it was 10 weeks
at the University of Delaware,
working on a research programme
with a salary of $2500. The culture
shock and language difficulties were
thrown in for free.
Delaware, for those who don't
know, is the smallest state on the
mainland US, next to Pennsylvania
and Maryland, about 120 miles
south of New York.
Anyhow, we arrived in Delaware
in the last week in June. The
accomodation was a nice surprise
- two bedroomed flat, air
conditioning, fitted kitchen,
telephones, close to the university
etc. I pitied the American students
who got Southside over here.
The first experience of American
'culture' was breakfast the next
morning. The waitresses were like
flies - they wouldn't leave you
alone. This is un-nerving coming
from England where bad service is
the norm. When they say 'Have a
nice day', try explaining that you
have other plans. This can confuse
them, especially if you can do a half
decent Hannibal Lecter grin.
A synopsis of the country can be
gained by watching the television.
Studs will leave you with the idea
that most women are blonde, slim
and incredibly stupid and that men
think with other parts of their
anatomy than their heads.
With M T V , Home Shopping and
the televangelists you can be staring
blankly at the screen for hours
without consciously taking anything
in. (A bit like a physics lecture!)
The televangelists are unbelievable
- God regularly phones them from
above. I could have been healed of
my boredom, had I been arsed to
get off the sofa, place my hands on
the T V screen and just believe. The
saving grace is that Cheers is on
every day.
Work was another story. We
were in the School of Health
Sciences (Biochemistry to you).
American students don't get a lot of
laboratory practice during their
science courses, so the supervisors
tended to treat you as if you hadn't
got a clue. You can only endure this
for so long. You have to feign
surprise and nod stupidly a lot when
they show you how to use a pipette.
Trips were organised for us by
the staff at the University, which

band? Why do they call football 'rugger' and soccer 'football' and
baseball 'rounders'?

included malls(!), 4th of July
fireworks in Philadelphia, baseball
in Baltimore, wandering in
Washington and 10,000 Harley
Davidsons in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania.
Some trips weren't exactly
organised, such as the idea to go to
New York. We ended up going to
a club on 5th Avenue where the
bouncer was a Julian Clary look-
alike, where the clientelle were
Mafiosi Godfathers and bimbos and
where the beds upstairs were open
to anyone. It was weird, but it
didn't end there. Where in
Brooklyn did we park the car? Why
are we the only whites on the
subway? Why was the best looking
woman all night a transvestite?
What are we doing here?
It wasn't always that exciting. We
did invent some amusing games to
play with the Americans:
(a) Convince them you're related
to the Royal Family and insist that
they call you 'Sir' and bow before
speaking to you.
(b) Hire 'Young Ones' and
'Blackadder' on video and try to
teach them that these series' are
funny. There is a cable channel
showing 4 hours a night of 'Are
You Being Served?' which is
regarded as a classic comedy.
(c) Go into 'Bob's Big Boy' (a
fast food chain) and ask for one as
you can imagine Rowan Atkinson
would.
(d) Try keeping a straight face
when someone comes up to you and
says 'Hi, I'm Randy.'
,(e) Insult them by explaining how
200 years of British Colonial Rule
should have taught them basic
English.
Overall, it was good fun, and
although we aren't dying to do it
again, it was a good opportunity to
experience a totally different
lifestyle. We're now going to
become E C Commissioners and
close Europe's borders to America.
Finally, we flew Virgin Atlantic
to and from the States and really
wished we hadn't now. One of us
was jettisoned off onto an Air India,
flight whilst the other was treated
to a nine hour drunken extravaganza
instead of films and sleep. Still, if
you enjoy getting pissed on planes
then Virgin's your airline, since the
cabin crew only tend to the drunks.
Their Customer Relations Service
is just as hopeless.
