Fleming Chair Goldsmith House
St Mary's Hospital Medical School
have announced a new appointment
to the Fleming Chair of Medical
Microbiology. Dr Douglas Young,
who is currently a Senior Scientist
at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School researching tuberculosis and
related infections, will begin work
at St Mary's in October 1993.
The work of the thirty-eight year
old Dr Young could result in major
improvements in testing for drug
resistant tuberculosis. He is also
chairman of the steering committee
for the World Health Organisation
programme, I M M Y C , promoting
research into the immunological
aspects of leprosy.
The Dean of St Mary's, Professor
Peter Richards, welcomed the
appointment of Dr Young, saying
that 'It is only fitting that this key
national chair be taken up by
someone of Dr Young's experience
and calibre.'
Esso Support
This week, Esso provided the
Department of Chemical
Engineering and Chemical
Technology with £21,000 to fund
a new design office, which will be
named after the company. The
money was awarded after the
Department succesfully bid for
funds under Esso's Higher
Education Support Scheme, and
contributes to the Chemical
Engineering Jubilee Appeal
launched by the Department in
1990, which has already raised
£300,000.
The office will have it's own
dedicated network of computer
workstations where students can
learn to develop complete
preliminary plant designs, based on
actual case studies provided by
Esso. The head of Department,
Professor Bill Wakeham
commented, 'We are delighted by
Esso's contribution which will go
towards ensuring that the facilities
in the Department continue to be
second to none.'
College has hired an external
agency to locate property in the
local area for a new residence. The
company has been called in after
attempts by the college itself to find
a suitable property proved
unsuccessful. The money for the
house, which is expected to cost in
the region of £300,000 including
refurbishment is mainly going to be
provided by the Worshipful
Company of Goldsmiths, who
recently made a sizeable donation
to the college for this purpose.
The new house is planned to
accomodate up to eight students,
and the college Estates Manager,
Mr N. Black, commented that the
'intention is to enable scholars to
live at moderate rents'. It is
believed that the potential residents
will be nominated by their
departments and selected on the
basis of academic merit.
Despite considerable advertising
for suitable property, there has so
far been no success in finding a
property entirely suitable for the
purpose, resulting in a local
property expert being contracted to
draw up a shortlist of approximately
10-12 properties which may be
suitable. The Rector, Sir Eric Ash,
is believed to be very interested in
the project.
Streeter Banned
Richard Streeter, House Committee
Chairman, has been banned from
the Union Building until Christmas.
The banning follows a Union
disciplinary hearing into the
disappearance of a Union minibus.
Felix has been informed that M r
Streeter borrowed a Union minibus
when it had been booked by another
person. The keys to the bus were
given to a third person by a Union
duty officer some days before. Mr
Streeter has also been banned from
driving any Union minibus for an
indefinite period. As a result of the
ban, meetings of the Union House
committee will take place outside of
the Union building, with M r
Streeter continuing to hold the post
of House chairman.
Voluntary Membership Timetable Announced
by Declan Curry
Voluntary membership will be
introduced before January 1994.
John Patten, the Secretary of State
for Education, has announced that
he will legislate for the voluntary
principle 'in the next session' of
parliament. Ministerial sources
have indicated that a green
consultation paper will be issued in
October 1993, and a white
legislative paper will be brought
before the House of Commons in
January 1994. The Department for
Education has also confirmed that
STUDENT
ACCOMMODATION OFFICE
IMPORTANT
NOTICE
On Tuesday 3rd November 1992
The Waiting List for College Halls
will close
From Wednesday 4th November
1992
Vacant rooms will be advertised in the
Accommodation Office and will be
allocated on a first come first served
basis.
ministerial consultations on
voluntary membership are still
continuing, though on an ad hoc
basis.
The Education Secretary was
speaking at a rally of Conservative
Students in the House of Commons
last week. M r Patten told the
meeting that he had been
encouraged to introduce voluntary
membership by students 'of all
political persuasions'. 'Sensible
students say the NUS (National
Union of Students) closed shop
must go', he said. 'It is an affront
that we have the last closed shop in
your world'. M r Patten added that
he would make a further substantial
announcement on voluntary
membership around Christmas. His
recent speech to the Conservative
Party conference was criticised for
not differentiating between campus
unions and the national union, and
for not detailing the specific
legislation he hopes to use to
introduce the voluntary principle.
The Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals (CVCP)
has warned the Secretary of State
that he will encounter substantial
difficulties in his attempts to draw
up voluntary membership
legislation. At some colleges, the
existence of the campus student
union is set out in the statute and
charter setting up the college. These
documents have a legal status of
their own, and in some cases they
have a legal standing equal to that
of legislation passed by parliament.
If the voluntary principle were to
be introduced, the charters of most
higher education institutions in the
country would have to be changed
on an individual basis. This would
usually be done by a body of
university commissioners, and
forcing through change would
become a lengthy process. David
Anderson Evans, of the C V C P , has
told /'CNN that ministers couldn't
'bugger around with charters and
statutes without going through the
Privy Council', effectively
Westminster's politburo. Conor
Pickering, the national director of
Conservative Students, told /CNN
that legislation would not be a
'question of central government
interfering with individual
institutions'. Jan Moore, of the
Department for Education, said that
'ministers have already made it
clear that they wish to introduce the
voluntary principle. They have no
reason to suppose that the
provisions of university charters
will prevent them from
implementing their policy'.
The imminence of the
introduction of voluntary
membership is concentrating the
minds of senior NUS sabbaticals.
The Presidents of all NUS affiliated
campus unions met recently in
Warwick University to plan a
'campaign of action' against
voluntary membership. The
meeting was also attended by senior
figures from NUS's Holloway Road
headquarters. The sabbaticals
decided on what they termed a
'positive campaign of union
promotion in preference to a
negative campaign' of
demonstrations and protests. The
NUS strategy has three main
strands, the promotion of students'
unions to members, an attack on the
voluntary principle, and a national
lobbying campaign. The first wave
of lobbying has already been
concluded, with Lorna Fitzsimons,
the NUS President, attending both
the Labour and Conservative Party
conferences. A campaign of student
union promotion is already being
planned by sabbaticals at Imperial
College Union (ICU), and Chris
Davidson, ICU President, has
already announced that he will be
meeting Nigel Forman, the Higher
Education minister, in the coming
weeks.
