all we need to know.
'You have, haven't you? Who is
she?'
'And will she, like, suck your
tootsies, man?'
'Bastards.'
'Well, come on, who is she?'
T'm going for a fag.'
The door slams shut behind him,
leaving a set of giggles in his wake.
This eventually lapses back into
lethargic silence as boredom once
more reasserts itself. Carver lies
back on the sofa, trying his best to
think of nothing, while Guy toys
irritably with a paintbrush.
Something is clearly worrying him.
'Adrian doesn't smoke.'
'After him!'
The sight of three people trying to
sneak up on a phone box is not a
common sight, but this being the
East End, it's usually better not to
know. Adrian, sweetly oblivious,
talks excitedly into the mouth piece,
and seemingly unaware of the fact
that she cannot see him, gestures
frenetically with his hands.
'Listen, Jilly, I'll see you on
Tuesday at... gmmmph... aarcgh!'
The wildly struggling Adrian is
dragged from the box, and another
hand takes up the receiver.
'Ady? Ady? Are you there?'
'Hah, you may have heard our
little traitor squealing, but it is too
late for you. Tomorrow we unleash
Microbe X and the world will be
ours!!' Click.
'Guy, man, you are weird.'
'Well, thank you. I didn't know
you cared.'
And so day passes into night, and
the four of us find ourselves sitting
at the front of the house. Carver and
Guy sit in the window ledge,
smoking, while Adrian and I perch
precariously on the wall bounding
the two square metres of front
'garden'.
T still can't believe you did that,'
says Adrian, idly toying with the
string holding the wall together.
'Well, you're still seeing her
tomorrow, aren't you?' replies
Guy, an angelic smile spreading
across his face.
Adrian really shouldn't have told
Guy where and when he was
meeting her. He'll regret it.
'Hey guys, does this like, remind
you of anything?'
'Like what, Carver?'
'It's just like being in the back of
a black cab, isn't it?'
Adrian buries his head in his
hands, but Guy likes the idea.
'Well, yes, but our house might
actually go south of the river at this
time of night.'
'But would it go to Dulwich?'
'Only if we tip well.'
Unseen, Brian makes his way up
the street towards the house,
disbelief camping out on his face.
'Yo, guys, what are you doing?'
'Driver, driver, stop the cab!!'
'Brian, how you doing? Fancy a
trip to Dulwich?'
'Is it just me or are you all
bored?'
Guy looks puzzled by this.
'Dunno,' he says, 'Ask the
driver.'
