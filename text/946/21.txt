Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat
About ten years ago Phil Schofield
was a mild-mannered man living in
New Zealand. He had the world at
his feet with a diploma in chiropody
and the future looked rosy. Where
did it all go so horribly wrong for
him?
In 1983 Phil started fronting Kiwi
Pop Kid show Shazam, two years
later he became the straight man for
a puppet gopher and the story was
almost completed with a
performance on the Children's
Royal Variety Show. Then he met
Jason. I never believed it could
happen but right before my eyes on
the Palladium stage Phil stepped
into the shoes of a rock legend.
Since Jason Donavan left
'Joseph' (the show, not his alleged
homosexual lover) one might be
forgiven for presuming that
attendances would drop. Nothing of
the sort. Tonight, a Tuesday, the
theatre is once again packed. The
show opens with T H A T song,
admittedly though 'Any Dream
Will Do' sounds terrific sung by a
hundred or so treacle-sweet
children. Phil joins them to a huge
welcome from all present and I
knew then I was in for a treat. By
the end of the song any doubts about
the boy Schofield's (he's 30) voice
have been long forgotten and I'm
completely engrosed until the
interval.
The Killing of Sister George
It were a lovely film, y'know. Dear
old Auntie Beryl Reid, overacting
her dear old heart out and facing her
pastures new with stoicism and
dread. Susannah York, her young
lover, passionate and frightened.
Would that I could say this play is
not a disappointment.
It shouldn't be; My problem with
the live theatre medium is that it is
live, and any attempt to ascribe
sincerity, or many of the darker
emotions grates just a little bit. It
may be my problem, but I don't
think I'm the only one. I also missed
the free drinkies they give out to
press bods, but I digress. The leads
handled their roles competently
enough; the decline of a popular
radio soap star is handled with
sensitivity and a modicum of very
appropriate melodrama, and its shift
from pathos to black comedy is
poignant enough. I wish I'd been
drunk; I would have loved to see the
mascara running in streaks down
my face.

Phillip Schofield, a fine figure of a man.
The second half starts like the
first half did, a babbling American
behind me has completely missed
the point and is dying to shout 'He's
behind you' or 'Oh no he isn't'
every time Phil appears on stage.
If he had done I would have
punched him. The tourist is soon
forgotten as Elvis appears in cameo
as the Egyptian Pharoah and
Joseph's brothers offer a calypso
version of the song Benjamin that
the Iron Lion from Zion himself
would have been proud of. The
show is wrapped up by a reprise of
'Any Dream Will Do' during which
Joseph is hoisted high into the air
in glorious technicolour...brilliant
stuff.
If you're still in any doubt about
going to see this show, don't be.
And don't think you'll stand out like
a grown-up amongst a teeny
audience, the word got around long
ago that Joseph is too good to be
wasted on children alone. By the
end you'll feel like you've known
all the songs all your life and
although it'll ruin your hard earned
street cred in the process, you'll be
declaring your undying love and
respect for Phillip Schofield for
ever more.

Art
The Art of Ancient Mexico
The sculptures in this exhibition
were carved by the Central
American civilisations in the two
and a half thousand years before the
Spanish conquest. I think it is very
appropriate to exhibit pre-Hispanic
art in this, the 500th anniversary of
the West's 'discovery' of America.
I liked this exhibition. It is
divided geographically, and
includes a rich mix of art from the
regions' cultures. The sculptures
are very different from the stuff we
were doing at that time. They
certainly had a different idea of
what a fertility goddess looked like!
The style is very plain, but not
simple. These stone age craftsmen
could produce anything from a skull
the size of a walnut to a huge snakes
head in anything from jade to clay!
Henry Moore was influenced by
this type of art, but don't let that put
you off. Definitely well worth a
visit!
