Do you want to do something aboutpollution in the environment, preventing
deaths in earthquakes, finding the causes of heart disease?
Well you can - through UROP,
Imperial College's Undergraduate
Research Opportunities
Programme.
UROP is a voluntary scheme
open to all undergraduates. It gives
them the opportunity to participate
in the research activities of the
college's postgraduates and staff.
Decide how much time you can
give to UROP - then join by
contacting a member of staff is able
and willing to have undergraduates
help in their laboratories. They are
listed in the UROP Directory 1992
- 1993, available free from Room
313C Mechanical Engineering
Building.
Through UROP you can:
• learn at first hand what research
is all about;
• contribute directly to knowledge
in a field of research;
• further interests you have already
developed;
• cross disciplinary boundaries;
• get your name on a publication;
• get useful paid work.
As one of the three leading
research universities in the U K
(along with Oxford and
Cambridge), IC has fine facilities
for research in a huge range of
fields. For example, on offer this
year, among other things, are work
on: the making of 3-D videos of
predatory waterfleas; biosensors for
use in clinical, food, or
manufacturing surroundings; the
performance of structural elements
in fire; communication of science
to the media; mathematical
modelling of financial investment;
robot vision for fire-fighting;
computerised programming of
medical tasks.
Questionnaires to previous years'
UROPeans show that
undergraduates value highly:
• being given responsibility;
• having independence in working;
• having the chance to talk with the
post-graduate students, post-
doctoral research fellows and
research assistants;
• being accepted as co-workers

If you are interested in paid
U R O P work for the summer

UROP students to start during term
time so that they can 'hit the ground
running' at the start of the summer
vacation
WHAT PUZZLES T H E BRITS ABOUT AMERICANS?
Why do they always tell your their names even if you haven't asked?
Do they insist on the right to bear arms because they're still worried
the British will invade them again?
Why don't they know where anything in Europe actually is?
Why do they call rugger 'football' and football 'soccer' and rounders
'baseball'?
WHAT PUZZLES AMERICANS ABOUT T H E BRITS
Why do they think they're more civilised than us?
Why can't you buy guns here?
How on earth does a tiny, backward, rain-soaked, boring, jumped-up,
broke, little teeny-weeny island still produce the occasional good rock
