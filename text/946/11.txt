RAG Raid
O.K. so maybe it was a little early,
but 18 raggies turned up last
Saturday morning to jump into a
mini-bus and go to Cambridge for
the day. On the way up things were
fairly quiet with everyone
recovering from the previous
night's partying. Having got there,
we quickly signed out collecting
tins, loaded ourselves up with Rag
Mags and set out to go and hassle
the locals. The collecting was good
and everyone seemed to be enjoying
themselves. Meanwhile free food
and drink were arranged to keep us
all happy. For this, we have Burger
King, Pizza Hut. and Nadia's
Patisserie to thank.
The top collector was Chris
Harvey-Fros with £ 1 0 3 , Chris
Davidson raised £77, and the grand
total for the event was a storming
£760.
The journey back was a little
more interesting, with everyone
sporadically bursting into rugby
songs and singing 'Miss American
Pie' more times than I care to
remember in a typically out of tune
way.
I hope that everyone enjoyed the
day as much as I did. Thank you to
anybody that had anything to do
with it.
