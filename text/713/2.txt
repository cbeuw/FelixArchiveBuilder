Boat
Bonanza?
Dear Sir,
I have been most
concerned by articles and
letters in the two most recent
editions of FELIX (710 and
711) dealing with two of IC's
most successful clubs. On
the one hand, the Boat Club
has received an unexpected
and, I believe, unwarrented
boost in the shape of a new
boat, while Industrial Society
has been subjected to a
concerted attack from this
and last year's Exec.
To deal with the Boat Club
first, I would ask this - Why
should Boat Club, a relatively
small though highly
successful group, receive an
effective £6,000 extra next
year when many clubs, with
far more members, are faced
with severe cash shortages?
In these times of financial
pressures I accept that cut
backs have to be made, but
the whole exercise seems
pointless when the money
left over from the last year,
which was meant to pay for
this year's £4,000 shortfall,
gets blown on a £6,000 boat.
Where's all the money
coming from? With the
ridiculous end of year claw-
back of unspent money in
the MSC's you expect some
spending sprees, but this
demonstrates how ludicrous
the system really is! I trust
however, that the current IC
Union Exec will have the
good sense to veto this
farewell gift of Ian Bull's to
ACC.
And so to a more serious
matter, not least because
INDSOC's membership is
close to a thousand. Imperial
College Industrial Society,
almost uniquely among
Union Clubs, actually
acheives something useful.
As a result of these
industrial contacts, INDSOC
also makes a sizeable
amount of money for itself,
through donations and fair
stall charges. This money is
paid to the Industrial Society
and placed in their account.
This is the only money that
goes into the account - no
membership fees, and no
Union money. The Union,
ever on the want for more
funds,eyes this account
greedily and wants to
integrate it with the S C C
account. However, this
money is given to INDSOC
by Industry for their use. Not
to spend on, for example,
CND SOC going £300 over
budget on useless films! If
the companies found that
their money was not being
spent on what was intended,
it is very likely that the
money will be withdrawn.
And where will we all be
then? As for the account
being uncontrolled and
unaudited, I have been
assured by certain INDSOC
committee members that
some of the country's most
prestigous accountancy firms
would be only too happy to
provide their services, free of
charge! As it stands, the
Union is likely to lose a great
deal of good will, and a great
deal of money as well. I only
hope that the Exec consider
the position very carefully.

Dear Sir,
I have just obtained a copy
of FELIX 711 containing half
of my last letter on the
subject of IndSoc's finances.
May I say that it only needed
to be 'epic' as a result of the
many errors and
misrepresentations in your
previous article and editorial.
It was a serious attempt to
redress these points and was
treated with contempt. In
future, I will think again
before deciding that the
FELIX Letter Page is a
suitable medium for
discussing the subject.
Meanwhile, I would be more
than happy to answer
questions, criticisms and
points of view from anyone
who cares to write to me via
Dear Editor,
When Aston University's
student newspaper printed
an article making fun of the
Bradford football fire, just a
few weeks ago, this was
reported prominantly in the
Guardian, Daily Mail, The
Times, The Daily Express,
The Birmingham Post and
the Birmingham Evening Mail
— as well as the Bradford
Telegraph and Argus. With
headlines such as
'Degrading, Despicable and
Disgusting' and even a
question in parliament to Mrs
Thatcher, is this really the
sort of publicity Imperial
College needs??
As for Rag Mag Editor
Tony Spencer's letter in the
last FELIX, I would like to
see him presenting the same
justification to a relative of
one of the Bradford victims
when they hear about this
sick 'humour' — and from my
experience at Aston I can
assure you that Bradford and
the rest of the country will
hear about Mr Spencer.
Yours sincerely,
Julian Rose

Executive
When Carl Burgess, Dave
Kingston and Quentin
Fontana were elected,
many people predicted that
they would make a series
of major cock-ups. These
peoples' worst fears have
been fulfilled. Incredibly,
they have managed to
waste over a thousand
pounds of Union funds—a
commodity in very short
supply—by banning the
Rag Mag. Tony Spencer set
out to produce a Rag Mag
that was 'over the top'. The
sabbatical Union officers
were warned (see FELIX
712) that the Rag Mag
needed to be edited
severely. However they
failed to do this. They
failed to do their job
properly.
Over the summer Union
sabbaticals are not over
worked. On many days
Carl, Dave and Quentin
have occupied themselves
by playing Risk and doing
the Times crossword! Yet
they were unable to find
time to check the Rag Mag
I 0 [ I I
I
properly. Union Sabbaticals
were given the power to
alter the Rag Mag to ensure
that it would not be
banned. It was the Union
sabbaticals job to ensure
that IC Union had a Rag
Mag that was sufficiently
tasteful to be sold. Their
failure to do this is going to
prove expensive.
It must be said that
Quentin had worked
efficiently when one
considers that he had little
experience of the way the
Union worked. Regretably,
however, the banning of
the Rag Mag is not the only
cock-up by Dave and Carl.
Carl has already
developed a reputation in
College for being an easily-
ignored incompetent. He
has regularly turned up to
important meetings with
influential College officials
not knowing what is to be
discussed. The Union is
failing to get its views, on
issues such as teaching
standards, across. Much of
the hard work by last years
sabbaticals and Union
officers is being wasted by
Carl's appalling
performance. Furthermore
people trying to use the
Union office are sick of
RCS hacks making
nuisances of themselves.
Yet instead of chucking
them out, Carl merely
encourages them.
Dave Kingston runs
around like a mad man. He
panics about people
wasting fifty pence, yet he
has already managed to
waste over a thousand
pounds. He tries to shout at
people as a way of
imposing his authority.
Anyone with any self-
respect laughs in his face.
So far the Union
sabbaticals have muddled
along because they haven't
been put under any
pressure. In just over two
weeks time the College will
be full of new students.
Union Committees will
begin to meet. Carl's and
Dave's actions will be
under their scrutiny and
they are unlikely to be
impressed with their
performances to date.
If Carl and Dave don't get
their acts together quickly
the Union will face
chaos.
Guilds
Having criticised someone I
thought I ought I to praise
someone. Symon Corns
and Dave Page have
worked really hard to
ensure Spanner appeared
this year. They have done a
really good job.
FELIX
Freshers FELIX will be out
in just over two weeks time.
Letters, small ads, What's
On entries, sports reports
and club articles must be
handed into the office by
12.30pm next Friday. I
know this is a little early,
but Fresher's FELIX is
going to be a bumper issue
so we need a bit more time
to get it completed.
