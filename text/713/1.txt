'Shocking and disgusting' Rag Mag banned

The 1985-86 Rag Mag has
been banned. The Rag Mag
was in such bad taste it
would ruin the reputation of
Imperial College, the
Executive decided. Guilds
President and Executive
Member, Roger Preece told
FELIX 'If we're not careful
Imperial will become more
renowned for it's obsenities
than it's excellance'.
The Union sabbaticals are
given the power to edit the Rag
Mag and remove any jokes that
may be offensive. Union
President, Carl Burgess, had the
Rag Mag he edited severely
censored. Mr Burgess was the
only sabbatical to read any of the
completed artwork and he only
checked a proportion. The Union
sabbaticals say that they trusted
Rag Mag Editor, Tony Spencer.
They say that Mr Spencer
included jokes that he had been
instructed to remove. Mr Spencer
says, though, that only jokes that
have been included and he was
asked to remove are in his
editorial. Only Mr Burgess
suggested that he include them
in his editorial.
Within hours of the Rag Mag's
delivery on Tuesday, Mr Burgess
realised that the Rag Mag would
have to be banned. He told FELIX
that the Rag Mag was designed
to shock rather then amuse. He
described it as 'shocking,
disgusting and appalling rubbish'.
An emergency Executive meeting
was called and the decision was
taken to ban the Rag Mag. Mr
Spencer complained that Mr
Burgess failed to give him time to
present his case. He says that at
6.00pm he was instructed to go
straight to the Union office. As
he was about to go out for the
evening, he couldn't go and so
was unable to present his case.
At the meeting The Executive
discovered that not only was it
offensive but it didn't give the
printer's address. This means that
the Rag Mag in it's present form
may be illegal.

If the Rag Mag ban isn't
revoked by the U G M , the Union
will have spent Â£1500 on a Rag
Mag that can not be sold.
Yesterday, the executive were
looking into ways of removing
the offending material. The
Executive were also trying to get
the printers to pay for having the
address added as the printers
had removed it from the artwork.
Many members of Rag
Committee believe that the Rag
Mag isn't offensive. Rag
Chairman, Jon Ingham, said he
didn't find the publication
offensive.
The Rag Mag was last banned
in 1981. In that year a U G M
decided the Rag Mag should be
removed from circulation. The
decision was later reversed, but
rag lost a large amount of money
that year as a result.
Late News
The Executive have decided to
reprint some of the pages of the
Rag Mag with the offensive jokes
removed. This means that a new
Rag Mag may be available for
Fresher's Week. The cost of
reprinting is unknown at present.
Tony Spencer is attempting to
prevent the reprinting arguing
that the U G M will reverse the
ban.
