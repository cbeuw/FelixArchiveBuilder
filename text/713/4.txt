Amandla
Riverside
Arnandia is the cultural
ensemole of the African
National Congress. They
were formed just over five
years ago in Angola and
have since performed
throughout Africa and
Europe.
The production is
stunning. Music, dance and
poetry are combined to
show how the suffering of
the African people in South
Africa and how the A N C
will win. The music has
strong modern western
influences — Electric
guitars, for example, are
used by the backing group
— but remaining distinctly
African. The dance is
traditional and stunning.
The poetry can best be
described as powerful.
My only criticism of
Amandla is that it tends at
times to ram a political
message down the
audience's throats.
Everyone in the audience is
likely to support the A N C
yet Amandla insisted on
making statements all
evening. The performance
would have been more
effective if the group had
concentrated on showing
the audience the cultural
heritage of South Africa.
Chickenhawk
Robert Mas©-i
When Robert Mason
dreamed of flying as a child
his dreams never included
incompetent superiors and
a nightmare war fought to
save a country from its cwn
inhabitants, but these
things were precisely what
he encountered in his year
as a combat helicopter pilot
in Vietnam.
Mason takes a strictly
autobiographical approach
to his subject and does not
attempt to take an overview
of the war but instead
shows, in close detail, the
reality of the war for him as
a participant. The book's
focus follows Mason from
flight-struck childhood
(very briefly described) and
through training before
reaching Vietnam. Here the
newly qualified Mason
learns the tricks of combat
flying; flying in formations
where rotor tips are only a
few feet apart, chopping
through trees with his tail
rotor and taking off in an
uncontrolled spin to
increase power.
Chickenhawk never
becomes boring as might
have easily happened to a
book with so much
emphasis on the actual
business of flying because
of the strong sense of story
imposed by Mason's own
progress as an increasingly
competent flyer and the
paradoxical decline of his
mind and morale.
Although Mason seems
reluctant to indulge in
detailed characterization
his gift for describing the
incidents of war such as a
mass execution he
witnesses and the captain
who is forced to order his
own position bombed in an
attempt to save his
command for provides
adequate compensation.
At times the sheer
insanity of the scenes
described recalls Catch-22,
but Mason does not aim for
humour and Chickenhawk
is not a comic novel; if
Mason's war seems to be
mad then it probably it was.
Brewster's
Millions
Richard Pryor is a very
talented comedian. Films
such as Richard Pryor Live
in Concert have made him
a household name. To
many people, Richard
Pryor and Eddie Murphy
are the only black
American comdians.
Unfortunately in this film
Pryor is not allowed to
shine. A weak director and
poor script manage to
stiffle Pryor's natural
ability.
The plot is quite simple.
Monty Brewster (Richard
Pryor) has to spend thirty
million dollars in a month.
Unfortunately he can't tell
his friends, gamble the
money give it to charity etc.
As you can imagine
Brewster has some fun en
route. A few of the scenes
are very funny. However
the jokes become
repetative. When the film
finished I was amazed to
discover it had only lasted
about one hundred
minutes. It really did drag.
If you're a Trading Places
fan then, you might like to
go to see this film. Much of
the humour is in that vein. I
warn you though, that it is
nowhere near as good.
When Pierre—Augustin
Caron de Beaumarchais
wrote La Follee Journee,
ou Le Marriage de Figaro in
1778, it took him three
years to get the play
Monty Brewster (Richard Pryor), Warren Cox (Stephen
Collins) and Angela Drake (Lonette McKee) in a scene from
the dull film, Brewster's Millions. With excellant shows like
Amandla and More Bigger Snacks Now on the stage in
London you've got to desperate to go and see this film
performed publicly. The
authorities were alarmed by
the political satire in the
piece. Louis XV1, the then
king of France, exclaimed
when he read it 'This man
mocks everything one
should respect in a
government. This is
detestable it will never be
performed'.
Nozze di Figaro, Mozart's
opera based on
Beaumarchais's work, is
now performed regularly in
all the world's leading
opera houses. People
regularly praise the work as
one of Mozart's finest
pieces of music. Rarely,
though, do people
apreciate the political
message of the work. The
new adaptation of the work
by Tony Britten and Nick
Broadhurst manages to get
Mozart's message across.
The production is set in the
sixties. As a result the
hypocracy appears to be
far more vivid then it ever
does in traditional grand
opera.
This is one of the best
pieces of theatre on in the
West End Stage at the
moment. A strong play and
strong acting combine to
make this production
essential viewing. This isn't
traditional grand opera, but
it is an excellant example
of how opera can be
adapted for a young
audience used to modern
theatre.
More Bigger
Snacks Now
ICA
More Bigger Snacks Now is
part of Wipe That Smile, an
international season of
visionary humour at the
ICA. The play contains
mime with sound mimicry
and words in a piece about
money, miracles snd
poverty. Four desperate
people plan escape routes
and fantasies from a dirty
living room, with it's
encompassing everyday
petty problems which feed
fear and paranoia, in a
surreal, brilliant and
dazzling series of sudden
emotional leaps and
breakneck comic routines.
Everything is covered, from
air travel and expensive
holiday, to a religious
apparition and a very funny
restaurant sketch. Highly
recommended.
