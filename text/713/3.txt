Frank Chickens
Greenwich is probably a
little far to go for a gig.
However if you want
excellant value for money I
suggest you visit
Greenwich Borough Hall
on Saturday 21 September
at 8.00pm when the Frank
Chickens will be playing.
Admission is only £2.50.
The Frank Chickens are
one of London's most witty
live acts. They were
nominated for a prestigious
Perrier award at the Fringe
this year.
Cosi Fan Tutte
Those of you who have
never been to the opera
should try to get along to
the Coliseum in the next
few weeks. The English
National Opera is
performing Mozart's Cosi
Fan Tutte. It's an excellant
opportunity to see one of
Mozart's best operas
performed by one of the
worlds top companies. If
you think opera is boring
go and see this, you'll be
pleasantly surprised.
Pineapple Dance Studios
offer over 700 courses for
dancers of all standards to
develop. There are courses
in tap, jazz, ballet, aerobics
to name but a few of the
subjects. Pineapple also
offers members showering
and changing facilities,
body control studios,
beauty studios and cafes.
Membership is £30 a year
and courses cost between
£2 and £2.50. The courses
are more expensive than
those offered by Keep Fit
and Dancing but if you
can't make the College
courses, Pineapple is an
alternative.

Films
The Phoenix Cinema in
East Finchley (opposite

one of London's excellent
independant cinemas.
Admission is exceptionally
good value at only £2.50.
Especially recommended is

Colonel Blimp which is
showing at the Phoenix for
seven days starting on

film was one of the few
films produced during the
Second World War that
wasn't excessively patriotic.
Colonel Blimp was
prepared to question the
system. Programmes start
at 4.55pm and 7.55pm.
