News Review
April: Members ofIC Christian Union
were caught in the Alton Towers
disaster.
ichairman of the Earth Science
Review Committee retorted that the
U G C ' s assessment was primarily
based o n a 'bid' i n which the
department outlined its plans for the
next ten years.
One of the recurrent themes this
year has been the widespread theft
of computer equipment from the
College. The thefts have cost the
College insurers well over £130,000.
Computer bonanza
The Rectors £6,000 I B M computer
was amongst the first to go from the
Electrical Engineering Department
in July. It was closely followed by
an IBM Landmark Computer valued
at £42,000, one of only three in the
world, which was taken from the
Royal School of Mines in April.
Further thefts followed o n an
almost weekly basis, baffling the
College Security service. Despite
sightings, police vigils, a near arrest
and descriptions being circulated
around the departments the thieves
continued unabated.
The College Security Chief, Geoff
Reeves said that the thefts were
made possible by staff and students
leaving back door entrances to
departments open.
The problem was eventually
solved w h e n security fitted
magnetic locks to the departmental
fire doors.
The U G M battle
A l l hell broke lose in January when
Imperial College Union Council
voted to abolish Union General
Meetings ( U G M ' s ) and turn itself
into the supreme decision making
body. The motion was put forward
as a concession to St Mary's Medical
School Union who argued that
Imperial's U G M ' s were
unrepresenatative because they
were unable to attend.
The m o v e w a s v i g o r o u s l y
opposed in the pages of FELIX, and
FELIX in conjunction with IC Radio
mounted a College wide 'say no to
no say' poster campaign.
Over 600 people turned up to the
meeting, including a delegation of
over 200 students from St Mary's in
one of the best attended meetings
for several years. Union President,

Nigel Baker argued that there was
no other way for the Union's to
merge, other than to abolish
U G M ' s . This was countered by
Union life member, Dave Parry,
who pointed out that the College
would be unlikely to accept some of
the ramifications of the move.
"The Union is the collective voice of
students. Without Union officers
directly reporting to its members the
Union will become divorced from
the people it represents' he said.
After fierce debate, the motion
was taken to the vote and defeated
by 150 votes.
St Mary's President, Phil Drew,
questioned whether the motion was
representative.
'IC has to look forward and stop
sticking in the m u d , ' he said.
Welfare fares well
In many ways, the year has held
some notable achievements for the
Union. In October, the Union
signed an agreement with Student
Travel Agents (STA) to provide
them with an outlet in the site of the
now disbanded sports shop. The
deal is set to earn the Union i n
excess of £12,000 per annum.
At the beginning of the year the
Careers service budget was cut back
by £10,000. This coincided with an
extra £10,000 for a new secretary for
the H U B office, run by the Rector's
wife, Clare A s h .
The move provided leverage for
the Union to persuade the College
to pay for a part time Welfare
Adviser. The Union pointed out that
the H U B Office secretary had been
appointed despite the College policy
of not replacing staff when they
leave.
Originally the Union planned to
share the adviser with U L U but after
a month of inactivity in October,
U L U rejected the idea saying that
the time scale for introduction of the
adviser w a s 'unfeasible a n d
u n r e a l i s t i c . '
Imperial decided to 'go it alone'
and by January Yve Posner, former
Islington Council Welfare Officer
was appointed to the post.
