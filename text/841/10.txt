The pros and cons of sizzling
Nik Jones on amateur rocketry
A v i d readers of ' H o b b y a n d
Modelling Mart' may have seen a
series of articles o n amateur
rocketry—what it is and how to do
it. It also described the building and
flight of the rocket kit 'SIZZLER'.
Quite by chance I have been
involved in exactly the same project,
my version of which appears below.
For more information read o n .
Amateur Rocketry (AR to it's
friends) was introduced to students
at Imperial at last term's 'Picocon'
science fiction convention. A R
started in America twenty years ago
and the business is dominated by
the firm 'Estes', whose proud boast
of 'over 150 million successful
flights' leaves one to ponder on the
number of unsuccessful flights.
Here, model rocket building has
been a hobby for years—although
actually launching a rocket was
illegal until eight months ago:
Customs and Excise having only
recently allowed the import of the
solid fuel engines from America. A s
a result, the grounded rockets built
by British hobbyists have mutated
into minor monstrosities (such as a
fin-stabilised Taj Mahal) for which
successful flight was a dubious
prospect.
Building a rocket is fairly simple.
At its most basic, the actual machine
consists of a hollow body with fins
glued o n at the base and a loosely
fitted nose-cone held o n with a
elastic string. A parachute stored
inside the main body ensures that
the rocket safely returns to earth.
The base of the rocket houses the
engine. This resembles a banger,
with a solid fuel charge sandwiched
between a clay base and a cardboard
wadding top.
The launching pad is a flat metal
plate and a three foot vertical spike
sticking out the middle. The plate
stops the exhaust from igniting the
grass underneath. A metal tube is
glued to the rocket body a n d
threaded onto the spike is used to
guide the rocket on the first stage of
its journey. The spike can be angled
to allow for the wind, although the
law does not look kindly on angles
of greater than 30° from the vertical.
The engines is ignited b y an
electrical fuse and a simple battery
and switch circuit. The circuit burns
out the fuse, melting the clay and
causing the solid fuel to ignite. This
provides the power to launch the
rocket.
A short while after the main bulk
of fuel is used u p , the cardboard
w a d d i n g ignites, p u s h i n g out
parachute and allowing the rocket
to float gently to earth. Simple! The
delay depends on the engine used.
The altitude attained can be
anywhere between 400 and 2,800
feet, depending on engine size and
rocket type. Obviously, a multi-
stage rocket can fly higher than a
single-stager.
A starter k i t is about £ 3 0 ,
excluding engines. Rocket kits can
be anywhere between £4 to £35, the
most expensive b e i n g the
'Astrocon'. This has a 110 camera
installed i n the nose a n d , o n
reaching the apex of its flight, will
automatically take a photograph of
the ground directly beneath it!
Engines are about £1.25 each. A t a
minimum of £2.50 a flight multi-
stage rockets are not cheap. To save
money, rockets can be built from
scratch. A friend made one from a
toilet roll, a ping-pong ball, balsa
wood fins and a parachute cut from
a plastic bag. It flew.
O n to the test of the 'SIZZLER'
rocket kit. This was carried out o n
a Friday afternoon by Imperial's
o w n M S E 1 A R C o n s o r t i u m .
Dressed i n lab coats we set u p the
launch pad by Speakers Corner i n
Hyde Park. Assembly of the rocket
had been done over two days to give
the resin holding it together long
enough to dry. Three launches were
carried out and it soon became
apparent that the ignition fuses
must be inserted very gently as they
are very fragile. Carry a few spares.
O n the second and third flights the
elastic string detached itself from the
body and the race was o n to catch
the nose before it achieved 'splash-
d o w n ' , i n the Serpentine.
Theoretically, the rocket should
have travelled 800 feet u p and 400
feet horizontally. Ours went over
1000 feet once and drifted half a mile
on the third launch! This was with
the spike angled into the wind. H a d
it been vertical, the Imperial Space
Program would have come to a
soggy end!
Incidentally, A R is illegal is Hyde
Park without permission from the
Secretary of State f o r t h e
Environment. However, the two
police vans who had been watching
our experiments made no attempt
to move us o n . Funny old world.
Rumour has it that starter kits are
available i n Hamleys. Rush down
there now and find out what all the
excitement is about!
