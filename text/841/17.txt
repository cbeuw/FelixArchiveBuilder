Opinion
Come back Dave B
all is forgiven.
Dave Burns' swan song, i n the last
issue of Felix, was stimulating,
written w i t h great verve and
conviction—a personal view of the
current state of the College. Mine,
no doubt equally singular, does not
in all respects tally with his, notably
with regard to our divergent view
on the merits of the Rector. What is
rather more surprising is that, on a
number of the issues he raises, I
would agree , or differ only by a
nuance.
But let us start with the R e c t o r -
he is so often uppermost in my
mind. I am sorry Dave that I bored
you on the first of October i n 1986.
It is, I fear, too late to make amends.
As to that infelicitous phrase which,
in a moment of exuberance, escaped
my lips, I will have to live with the
record—as did Queen Elizabeth the
First, with respect to the occasion of
her celebrated non-verbal utterance,
which has reverberated through the
centuries, though of course none of
her courtiers heard a thing.
I am told that I recommended
joining a club (singular). N o w what
is i n m y m e n t a l R O M is a
recommendation to join two and to
devote serious efforts to both—one
sport and one society. Perhaps I
reached the second one, after Dave
had fallen asleep.
"The Rector has declined to write
items for Felix this year...". Not
so—he was never asked! In case my
senile memory was at fault, I did
check this with the Editor. W h y is
he not seen more with the troops?
Well now, there y o u have struck a
sore point. In the transformation
from a working academic, to this
job, the reduced opportunites for
direct contact with students is the bit
that I find most frustrating. Its a
problem which is not easy to cure.
I do see groups of students, usually
those playing some specific r o l e -
academic affairs, representatives on
student/staff committees etc. I have
supervised one P h . D student—that
worked, but only because he was
prepared to see me at 8 a.m. What
about the other 6000? I would
.welcome suggestions. I did actually
tell the President that I would be
Page 16
happy to attend a Union Meeting
and field questions. I did do just that
once, when Taig was Queen. I am
game to try it again. But of course,
not many students come to Union
meetings
I should add that the role of chief
executive of Imperial College is
arduous—much, much more so
than running some commercial
organisation h a v i n g a similar
turnover. Its not hierarchical-
persuasion is all. Moreover the
university system is under attack—
and has been for the best part of two
decades. Paradoxically, it is much
harder to defend an elite place such
as ours, where almost every
Department is amongst the top
three i n the country, than a
mediocre university. If y o u cut a
little f r o m a r u n - o f - t h e - m i l l
university, it simply gives its
mediocrity a slightly different hue.
Cut bits in Imperial College and the
damage is immediate and real. The
avoidance of lasting damage
remains a formidable challenge.
I cannot find any evidence to
support Dave's analysis of the
Union—how, in golden days it had
hummed and now was on the
slippery slope to doom. He appears
to recommend "kicking arse" (k.a.),
Dave Burns—home and dry or out at sea?

as the primary route for effecting
changes. It may work in the Navy,
but in the real world, it is very rarely
a successful strategy, though it can
give great satisfaction to the kicker,
an outlet for suppressed frustration;
it is above all a call for public
recognition: "I go, I go, look how I go,
Swifter than the arrowfrom the Tartar's
bow".
In the Presidents that Dave
compared and contrasted, he
believes that "Christine Taig did not
set out to change the world, so the
world was not changed". Well
Dave, the world is a great big place.
But let me tell you of one little bit
of it that she did change. We had the
chance to buy 10 houses in Evelyn
Gardens. Then as now, we had no
money. We had to borrow the stuff.
To service the loan, this required a
complex rejigging of student rents,
which could not have been done
without the support of the Student
body. Christine Taig pulled it off. A s
a result we have Fisher Hall; 200
more students can live within
walking distance. Sure the rents are
higher than anyone wants—but to
my mind getting rooms within
walking or cycling distance is the
most important single problem the
College faces. What good would
k.a. have done?
I find myself in agreement with
the critique that too many students
start narrow and emerge even
narrower. But it is not a new
problem and I am sure that contrary
to Dave Burns' view things are
getting better. Here the perspective
lent by o l d age does have
advantages. I arrived here i n 1945
(No, the Rector did not address us;
I do not think I ever clapped eyes
on the fellow in my undergraduate
days). The social life was very
lestricted, the Clubs and Societies
a minute fraction of the riches now
on offer. There was for example no
orchestra, no chamber music. The
nearest port off call for that was
Bloomsbury. N o w the orchestra and
the choir are magnificent and as
near professional as any set of
amateurs are likely to get. We have
soloists who, should they tire of
