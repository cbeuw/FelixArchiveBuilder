As You Like It
OLD VIC
At the start of the play w e are
confronted w i t h a n angular
monstrosity of a set. A black steel
jutting and blood red walls put us
in the mood for a tragedy rather
than a light-hearted comedy. Maybe
someone had forgotten that King
Lear had ended its run.
Unfortunately, the scenery
actually gets much worse, as the
play moves into the forests of
Arden. We expect green grass, a
brook, and a stage drenched i n a
cheerful summer light. W e are
treated to dirt brown soil, poor
lighting, a collapsed view of the
woodland through a tunnel, and a
single stuffed stag. It becomes even
more horrific when side panels are
uncovered to reveal reams of grafitri
professing Orlando's love for
Rosalind.
The tone of the play, in general,
is so slow that it is left wanting. The
otherwise satisfactory Karl Johnson
as Jacques, delivers his ' A l l the
world's a stage...' Speech with such
solemnity that one feels like
sleeping through it rather than
marvelling at it. It is only when
Rosalind and Orlando perform their
rapid repartee that the play captures
a m o o d a n d atmosphere of
enchantment.
In fact, what saves the play is the
excellence with which the lead roles
are handled. Fiona Shaw's Rosalind
is the heart of the play. She has to
play a girl acting as a boy acting as
a girl. It is a part of such complexity
and intricacy that to see Fiona Shaw
pull it off so adeptly was a joy. She
is given good support by A d a m
Kote as a naive, boyishly charming
Orlando.
It is to the full credit of these two
leads that the text of Shakespeare
shines through despite the
abhoration of a set.

Hamlet
A s reviewed in last week's issue,
Daniel D a y - L e w i s gives a
mesmerising performance i n
Richard Eyre's elaborate production
of Shakespeare's greatest work. The
depth a n d appeal lies i n the
complicated and ironic character of
Hamlet, which is not lost to the scale
of the production. Judy Dench and
Michael Byrant head a powerful
support cast.
Ghetto
Joshua Sobol's play/musical is a
moving testament to the courage
and resilience of Jewish groups
under threat of extermination from
the Nazis. To save as many lives i n
the Ghetto, they form a theatre. If
one has employment, he is deemed
to be useful and therefore escapes
execution.
The harrowing set serves as a
monument to oppression. The
music and lyrics are edged with
poignancy a n d sorrow. T h e
emotional ending may be a sad one,
but the message is one of hope and
brotherhood.
This is a unique theatrical
experience I fully recommend it.
The Black Prince
The March on Russia
Bill O w e n gives a touching
performance as a retired miner, in
David Storey's play about life,
family, old-age and responsibilities.
It delves into the individual's
isolation and the workings of society
seen through various members of a
'happy' family from the coal faces
of the North to the affluence of the
South; from f e m i n i s m a n d
independence to traditional
values—each one has a view to put
across, but a single-minded way of
saying it.
The performances are good but
the script often has nowhere to go,
and we are left with our thoughts
drifting away from the stage.
Also recommended at the National
are:
Hedda Gabler—Juliet Stevenson
gives a memorable, contemplative
performance i n Ibsen's classic,
reworked by Christoper Hampton
(Les Liaison's Dangereuses)
Fuente Ovejuna—The tiny
Cottleshoe stage comes to life with
a tale of oppression and civil unrest
in a small Spanish village.
All productions run throughout the
summer.
The Black
Prince
ALDWYCH THEATRE
Iris Murdoch's intellectual comedy
touches on such topics as the nature
of art, literature, happiness and
neurosis. The central character,
Bradley (Ian McDiarmid), is a
middle aged writer who has never
written anything because, he says,
he is a perfectionist. In the first half
he prides himself on his aloofness
The
Plantagenets
THE BARBICAN (RSC)
This trilogy of Shakespearean
histories, chronicling the life of
Henry VI, the rise of Edward IV and
the death of Richard III, continues
its successful run at the Barbican.
The action comes thick and fast, the
sets are brilliantly simplistic and the
acting is top notch. There are
remarkable performances from
Ralph Fiennes as Henry V I and
Penny Downie as Queen Margaret,
with flashes of genius from Anton
Lesser as Richard III. Inspired
direction from Adrian Noble keeps
it flowing smoothly. The limpid
exposition and majestic spectacle
make this an experience to cherish.
MacBeth
THE BARBICAN (RSC)
Adrian Noble's sinister and evil
production of 'the Scottish play'
singularly lacks innovation, but is
still a good example of a solid, sure-
footed staging of the play.
Miles A n d e r s o n plays a n
unremarkable MacBeth, the only
one of Shakespeare's great tragic
figures to be utterly damned.
The emphasis i n this production
lies heavily on a greedy, ambitious
MacBeth, but loses a lot of the tragic
qualities by making him so utterly
dispicable. To add some sort of
levity to the play, the scenes with
the three witches turn into semi-
comic pieces, which I feel destroys
the mood.
What dramatic impact there is, is
offered by the dark and gloomy set,
in which the walls move in, making
MacBeth's world more claustrophic.
The e n d i n g , particularly, is
i m m e n s e l y p o w e r f u l a n d
impressively choreographed i n its
use of special effects. But on the
whole it's an unmoving experience.
and incorruptibility by life. Then in
the second half he suddenly
succumbs to a mad passion for his
friend's teenage daughter.
Ideas and intellectual agitations
thread their way through the
character's escapades. A farcical first
half turns to murder, mayhem and
misery i n the second. Throughout
the play McDiarmid's philosophical
flamboyance rides out the bumps in
the story, making it a highly
enjoyable, compelling performance.
The self-indulgent rant about
Hamlet is especially funny
