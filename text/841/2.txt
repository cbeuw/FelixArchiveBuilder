Felix
The Editorial
A very secret society
Freedom of information and 'the
right to know' is a subject which is
close to the heart of every journalist.
It is particularly close to the heart of
British journalists because Britain is
becoming too secretive for its own
good.
In the true spirit of pravda, the
proposed changes to section two of
the Official Secrets Act will restrict
individuals 'right to k n o w ' whilst
proclaiming perestroika.
Less widely proclaimed is the fact
that the act w i l l remove a n
individuals right to claim to be
acting in the interests of the public
when accused of leaking 'sensitive'
information. A n d , in what must be
the ultimate absurdity, it will
become illegel to repeat 'sensitive'
information even if it has been
published elsewhere and is common
knowledge.
The Data Protection Act is another
case in point. Ostensibly the act is
designed to allow individuals to
access files of personal information
stored about them on computer. In
practice, the act contains so many
loop holes and the Data Protection
Registry is so short of power and
resources that the act has become
almost ineffectual. The Government
computers are of course exempt
from the act.
Every one remembers Peter
Wrights problems with Svycatcher.
But the affair is only one of a series
of media clampdowns which began
with Duncan Campbells 'Zircon
satellite' programme banned from
the BBC despite the fact that it was
based o n information which h a d
already been published.
The country's growing paranoia
and obsession with secrecy is as
unnecessary as it is unhealthy. I
would not argue with the claim that
matters which are important to
national security should not be
broadcast to potential foreign
enemies, but as investagative
journalist Steve Connor has pointed
out in an interview elsewhere in this
issue, there is a need for 'national
security' to be properly defined; too
often it is used as a blanket term to
hide political embarrassment.
Perhaps Britain ought to take a
lesson from the United States whose
'Freedom of Information act' has
proved that Governments do not
collapse when a country's citizens
know what the Government is u p
to.
A very secret Union
Imperial College's o w n student
Union would also do well to sit up
and take note of the 'Freedom of
Information act.'
Over the past two years it has
embarked o n its own dangerous
course of secrecy a n d press
paranoia. A n d it has divorced itself
further a n d further from the
students it represents.
The relationship between FELIX
and the Union has been tenuous in
the past, but the iron curtain which
separated FELIX a n d the Union
Office in the heat of last year now
separates the U n i o n from the
students.
The Union is becoming less of a
student organisation and more of a
business. It is becoming obsessed
with money whilst forgetting that it
should be a service to the students.
O n a political level, the Union
seems to be drifting away from its
roots. Union General Meetings have
been very badly advertised this year
and consequently very badly
attended. Instead U G M s are rushed
through as quickly as possible and
important issues are decided upon
by only a handful of hacks.
The U n i o n ' s attitude w a s
summed up by their failed attempt
to abolish Union General Meetings
altogether. H a d this gone ahead,
power would have been centralised
with the 30 people who regularly
turn up to Union Councils, and not
with the student body.
The irony is that people will
attend U G M s if they are told about
them. FELIX and IC Radio proved
the point with a College-wide 'say
no to no say' poster campaign. The
campaign resulted in the most well
attended U G M for several years,
with over 400 IC and 250 St Mary's
students turning up.
I am often accused of having
produced a 'biased' edition of FELIX
and u n f a i r l y i n f l u e n c i n g the
outcome of the U G M by printing
opinion articles which were anti-
abolition. In return I could accuse
the Union of unfairly biasing the
outcome of the U G M by having 250
students from St Mary's to turn up
to vote for abolition.
The U n i o n C o u n c i l too, is
b e c o m i n g more of a closet
organisation. Earlier i n the year a
motion was submitted by next
year's president to the effect that the
minutes of C o u n c i l ' s s u b
committees should not be circuited
to members of Council. The motion
was ostensibly tabled o n the
grounds that this would reduce the
length of Council meetings a n d
tempered with the claim that
minutes would be available for
reference in the Union Office.
In practice the changes have made
no difference to the length of
Council. What they have done is
give next year's Executive carte
blanche to push through any policy
they see fit without the rest of the
Union being any the wiser.
It would be naive of us not to
expect them to exploit it.
A very dangerous press
A free media is very dangerous to
a Union which would rather make
its decisions behind closed doors. So
it will come as no surprise to learn
that FELIX has been singled out
from the Colleges other publications
with behind the scenes threats from
the Union Office to attack the papers
editorial freedom.
But as students are well aware,
and as President Nigel Baker
demonstrated with FIDO, a paper
which is not editorially free is not
worth reading.
A n d so the Union have played on
the FELIX Editors other role as Print
Unit Manager.
A t M o n d a y ' s C o u n c i l , a
seemingly innocuous policy was
passed which again singled out
FELIX from the other publications
by insisting that the FELIX Editor
present reports to Council o n the
Print Unit.
It is innoccuous aside from the
Union's declared intention that the
opportunity should be used to force
FELIX to take o n more 'external'
printing jobs.
They forget that FELIX Editor
already works a seventy hour week.
They overlook the fact that the print
units primary role is the production
of FELIX and publicity for clubs and
they ignore the fact that if we took
on more outside work it would be
at the expense of the clubs and
FELIX. Its a case once again of
profits being put above students.
A very last word
Enough of this. I'm off into the big
wide world and I must leave the
future of FELIX and the Union in the
capable hands of m y successor,
Dave Smedley.

This is what I look like on a good day.
There have been few editions of
FELIX I have liked entirely, but this
one comes close. It was originally
going to have h a d colour inside
pages, but due to litho failure this
issue had to be entirely printed
outside and the colour had to be
dropped.
It's bloody typical.
