On the Tube?
The Subterranean Avengers
Alex Upton-Park is something major
in the City: one of those people who
appears with monotonous regularity
on television and radio to talk about
RPIs and balances of payments. H e
has spent all his working life in the
City where he started as something-
junior-to-someone-minor almost
twenty years ago.
This is the public face of Alex
Upton-Park Cityman. But there is
more to him than this, for Alex
Upton-Park is the founder and
guiding light of the mysterious
commuter group "The Subterranean
Avengers'.
To find out more, I agreed to meet
Upton-Park one lunchtime at
Embankment Station. I was to carry
a copy of the Telegraph under one
arm and a copy of Time Out under
the other. I felt schizophrenic. A t
one thirteen precisely he appeared,
his large bowler hat all but covering
his eyes and carrying a long
umbrella. He rushed across the
station to shake me by the hand.
'Hallo! Upton-Park's the name, of
M i d b a r c l l o y d de Zoett West
Merchant Bank,' his voice dropped
to less than a whisper, 'you're from
the newspaper?'. I nodded. He
gestured towards a nearby
luminous green plastic seat. We
both sat down.
'The others,' he whispered,
glancing nervously around, 'will be
along in a minute.'
A train arrived. The passengers
squeezed like grey toothpaste onto
the platform and forced their way
up the stairs and out into the fresh,
clean carbon-monoxide on which
Londoners thrive.
Suddenly Upton-Park stood up.
He looked up and d o w n the
platform, apparently scrutinising
every face. 'They're here!' he
announced mysteriously, 'the
interview may commence.'
I took out my notepad and pen,
sharpened my cliches, took a deep
breath and asked the question
which had been irritating me all day:
'What exactly are the Subterranean
Avengers?'
Upton-Park looked at me with
contempt. I was obviously not in the
know. ' W E , ' he emphasised the
w o r d , 'are the O R I G I N A L
commuter protection organisation.
For over a decade, W E have
patrolled the U n d e r g r o u n d :
protecting the humble commuter
from the dregs of society, fighting
for what is right and what is British.
One for all and all for one!' He stood
to attention and saluted. I pretended
I wasn't there. A l l around me,
people hid inside their newspapers,
or started reading the wall posters.
It's a universal language, they were
all saying 'never seen h i m before'.
Upton-Park hummed the National
Anthem and sat down. ' W h y me?'
I thought.
Upton-Park put his patriotism
away and continued.
'Our primary task is to prevent
trouble. N o w I know Kung- Ludo
and all that is very popular with
these Guardian Angels, but it just
isn't very British. Too direct. Too
foreign. We work by forcing any
potential trouble makers off the
trains before they can do anything'.
As if one cue, a train arrived and
Upton-Park jumped on board. I
followed.
We were in a fairly standard
carriage, surrounded by graffiti,
adverts for temping agencies and
'Poems on the Underground'.
Upton-Park managed to get a seat.
I had to stand. 'See that man,' he
pointed with his umbrella, 'that's
Jim Snaresbrook. He will be the
"target" for this demonstration.'.
Snaresbrook was a small wimpish
man carrying a copy of the Times.
He was apparently trying to do the
crossword.
'Say, the target looks as if he is
about to cause an incident, the
Avenger i n charge, k n o w n as
"District Line Information", will
signal to others present that there is
going to be an attack. Like this.'
Upton-Park hit the roof twice with
his umbrella and looked long and
hard at Snaresbrook. A tall man at
the far end of the carriage started to
weave through the crowd. He
stopped just behind the unfortunate
target. 'This is stage one,' Upton-
Park informed me, "The lanky
fellow is from the Crossword
squad'.
From where I was standing I
could just hear the two men. The tall
man was leaning over the shorter
man's shoulder. ' N o , ' he was
saying, 'six d o w n is definitely
wrong. Seven across is obviously
"seraglio". G o d , I could do this
puzzle with my eyes closed...' He
had a whining, patronising voice of
the sort you wouldn't inflict on your
worse enemy. H e seemed to be able
to talk without moving his teeth.
U p t o n - P a r k e x p l a i n e d . The
C r o s s w o r d S q u a d apparently
receives early copies of every
newspaper and a highly trained
team spend much of the early
morning solving them. Copies of
the solutions are then sent to the
duty members w h o are under
orders to memorise and destroy
them. This valuable information can
then be used to irritate people to the
point of distraction.
Upton-Park swung his umbrella in
a tight circle above his head and the
Crossword Squad withdrew. 'Stage
Two,' he told me, 'is the umbrellas.'
He took his hat off and put it back
on again.
The Umbrella Squad leapt into
action. Upton-Park pointed out each
member in turn. There was a short
chubby lady armed with one of
those s p r i n g - l o a d e d f o l d i n g
umbrellas w h i c h open at the
slightest provocation; a military
looking man wielding a short heavy
umbrella build like a club; and, the
most lethal of all, a city gent carrying
a long pointed bayonet-like brolly
underneath his arm. 'We brought a
job lot of brollys second hand from
the Bulgarian Embassy,' explained
Upton-Park.
They a d v a n c e d o n the
unfortunate target, barging through
the unseeing c r o w d s . W i t h i n
seconds, he was surrounded. The
actual attack was a short as it was
v i c i o u s . I h a r d l y saw what
happened. There was a boing, a
crunch, a thud, two gurgles and a
howl of pain. Next thing I saw was
Snaresbrook doubled up as his
attackers lost themselves again in
the crowd.
'If stages one and two fail, we
have to resort to our last resort. The
most hideous form of mental torture
k n o w n to man. The Walkmen.
Observe...'. Upton-Park stood up,
stamped his foot and sat d o w n
again.
I began to hear a thudding hissing
Sound. Dum-di-di-dum-di-di. I
looked around. Almost everyone in
the carriage seemed to be wearing
a walkman. They were all slowly
turning up the volume. 'Stage three,
level one,' Upton-Park informed
me. He stood up again and stamped
his foot twice.
The walkmen owners started to
hum. It was a tuneless sort of hum,
closer to a moan or a whine. It
became louder and louder, more
persistent and more irritating. M y
head started to ache. In the middle
of it all, the target was trembling.
'Level two,' Upton-Park shouted
above the din. 'The Walkman Squad
have never ever had to go above a
level two. But, if pushed we will
resort to level three, our final,
desperate ultimate deterrent.
Watch!'.
He grabbed two ceiling straps and
did a forward roll in m i d air: a
difficult manoeuver in a crowded
tube train. The effect was sudden,
frightening and unforgettable.
Suddenly the walkmen owners all
started to sing. It was the worst
