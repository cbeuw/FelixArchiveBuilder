After a novel twist i n Monday's
Joint Union Council meeting, next
year's FELIX editor is to receive full
voting rights o n Council as well as
permanent observer status o n the
U n i o n ' s Executive, subject to
ratification at t w o consecutive
U G M s .
FELIX editor Bill G o o d w i n said

these policy changes have
confirmed it. It's about time the Exec
became accountable to FELIX.'
Summer Fair fairs well
This year's Summer Fair saw a n
overwhelming attendance with
stalls from many Union clubs and
societies as well as exhibitions by
many of the College's departments.
Food from around the world was
provided by some of the Overseas
societies, whilst people took part in
a number of competitions, with
prizes ranging from a balloon trip
with champagne on board to a lap-

A m o n g s t the more suspect
competition winners was the tutor
of next year's President N e i l
McCluskey, who acted as master of
ceremonies with College Secretary,
John Smith. There was also an
unusually large number of Smiths
amongst the day's winners.

with the machine but his attempts
to save the three vital kipper springs
at the heart of the press failed. 'I'm

yesterday, 'but then so's the litho.'
Publications Board Chairman John
Denham added 'It serves the old
b*st*rd right.'
