At this time of year, a strange and
n o w familiar feeling always
percolates softly through Walters
hardened and drink—sodden soul;
a feeling which can best be summed
up by the phrase "There we went
again"—to be spoken with a sigh,
and i n a resigned tone of voice.
Another year is in the last drawn out
stages of grinding to a close, and
members of staff are drawing the
blinds and dusting off the bottles of
South African sherry, i n readiness
for the celebration of the departure
of yet another mass of the great
unwashed, waving their newly
minted degrees, into the brave new
world of chartered accountancy.
Walter would naturally be the last
person to heap scorn o n anyone
whose chosen career involved
dirtying their hands with the
passage of large amounts of
someone elses money, but—largely
due to the stickiness of his o w n
relations with accountants over the
last few decades—he is inclined to
view the financial professions with
a rather jaundiced eye. In other
words, may they rot in Hell. Slowly.
Just to prove that this is the last
article this year, there now follow a
few lines from a song by the
immortal Ralph Vaughn Williams:*
Let other men make money faster,
labouring in the dark runed towns.
I don't fear a peevish master,
though no man may heed m y
frown.
I be free to go abroad, or take again
my homeward road,
To where for me the apple tree do
lean down low, i n Linden Lea.
To those of you who are surprised
at someone as embittered as Walter
quoting poetry, here's a bigger
surprise: Walter has joined the
green revolution.
It's true! Not only has he taken to
adding lead-free gin to his cocktails,
but he is at this moment wearing an
additive-free tie, and this article was
typed i n its entirety on a recycled
word-processor. Until recently he
was investigating the possibility of
fitting a catalytic converter to his
cigarette holder, but he feels that the
cost, estimated at £600, is a little
excessive. See the above remarks
about accountants.
A l l this atmosphere awareness
business has led Walter to wonder
whether hot air—of the human
derived variety—can be considered
a Greenhouse Gas. If so, apart from
the obvious contribution made by
politicians within College a n d
without, it is clear that people such
as Dylan James should stand up and
be counted, so to speak, for the
damage they are doing to the
atmosphere. Since last he appeared
in these pages, Walter has actually
met M r James, and was surprised to
find that he seemed harmless
e n o u g h — h a r d l y the f r o t h i n g
Ghengis Kahn type one was led to
expect. It only goes to prove, for the
hundredth time, that you shouldn't
believe all y o u read, even in this
exalted journal.
Who was it who said that happy
men don't write their memoirs? The
name of this perceptive individual
escapes Walter for the moment, but
the truism remains true all the same,
and applies most of all to the
volumes of hindsighted wisdom
being penned at this time of year by
our esteemed sabbaticals: If the
length of the memoir is proportional
to the degree of unhappiness, then
Nigel Baker (may his tribe increase)
must be a miserable m a n indeed,
and w h o can blame h i m . Never
mind, old son: Nearly over now.
A n d finally—for there must
always be an and finally—Walter
would like to thank all those well-
wishers w h o have enquired after
h i m during his recent illness.
Actually, illness is hardly the right
word. What happened, not for the
first time, is that he was obliged to
go into hiding to avoid those nice
men from the Inland Revenue. H e
would also like to thank the staff of
H M Prison W o r m w o o d Scrubs for
allowing h i m to write these lines
from the comfort of his modern,
well equipped cell, and for the
assurance that he may get off with
three years if he keeps his nose
clean. Roughly the equivalent of
being sentanced to three years at
Imperial College, don't you think?
A l l the best!
