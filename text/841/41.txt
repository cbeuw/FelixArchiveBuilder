Licence to Kill
The sixteenth Bond adventure
marks a slight change of direction
for the films. Not much of a change,
but a noticeable one. The tone is
more of gritty realism rather than
fanciful light-heartedness. This time
Bond is on his own, dismissed from
the British SS, he sets out o n a
personal mission of vengeance for
his friend FELIX Leiter. H e is pitted
against Sanchez, a drugs lord (a
supremely nihilistic performance by
Robert Davi). It's still thrill-a-minute
stuff, but Timothy Dalton portrays
a much more serious, earthly Bond.
I, for one, welcome the change.
Release date 16th June.
Dealers

Rebecca de M o r n e y star i n a

Legend of the Holy Drinker
A beautifully poetic and, at times,
surrealistic, work about a tramp
(Rutger Hauer) who is humanised
through a gift for money. Hauer
says little but conveys much i n a
powerful portrayal.
Release in September.
Young Einstein
Totally insane Australian comedy

Theory of Relativity, invents the

Europe with an atomic beer keg at
the 1906 Science Academy Awards.
