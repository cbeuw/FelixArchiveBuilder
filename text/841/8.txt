Imperial College
With the recent increased interest in
Europe and the 'breaking d o w n ' of
barriers scheduled for 1992 FELIX
investigated the impact 1992 will
have upon Imperial College. One of
the most relevant aspects of the
unification of the E u r o p e a n
Community will be the freedom of
movement to work i n any E C
country. Therefore graduates who
have a knowledge of a n E C
language will be at an advantage.
Presently students at IC can study
foreign languages in evening classes
with the Humanities Department
and some courses include a foreign
language as part of the degree.
A p p r o x i m a t e l y 500 students
enrolled for language courses this
year and M r Stables, Head of the
Humanities Department, anticipates
further increasees. This October
students will be starting degree
courses which will contain a year in
Europe (or at least a year i n
continental Europe) as College
realised that Britain is in E u r o p e -
part of the mentality the whole
nation will have to deal with. The
Humanities Department is offering,
as a result of these course, language
courses which contain a more
technical and scientific vocabulary.
British standards i n engineering
and science will need to be replaced
with European standards. This has
already started a n d Professor
Dowling of Imperial College is
chairman of t h e E u r o p e a n
Committee agreeing uniform codes
of practice with steel structures.
Students will feel the effects of these
changes directly.
The status and, more importantly,
the salary of engineers and scientists
is generally higher in continental
Europe. M a n y IC graduates may
manage to both stay i n engineering
and get a reward for doing so by
joining the army of British workers
in other E C countries encouraged by
the changes of 1992.
The greater implication of the
European Community has led to
some major potential merges
between technological companies.
For instance there has been mention
of a linking of Siemens G E C and
Plessy. this will have some impact
on a college like Imperial which
deserves a substantial income from
research contracts. The effect of 1992
will be to offer greater opportunity
for contacts from European firms.
Currently Brussels awards research
grants a n d the money directed
towards it for redistribution will
increase. Already Imperial is well
placed with about seventeen such
pre-competition research grants, out
of a total of thirty in the U K .
Environmental controls decided
by the European Parliament will be
tougher than the current British
ones. This will result in more money
being available for environmental
research, and Imperial has recently
set up a centre for environmental
technology.
One important feature of the
development of undergraduate
courses is to include somewhere
along the line education about how
people in other E C countries think
and behave. The Dean of City and
Guilds, Professor Pat Holmes,
pointed out the example of a West
German marketing director w h o
said that he sells his products i n
English but buys stuff in German.
Professor Holmes went on to say
that the Board of Studies had spent
time discussing what sort of
language courses should be taught
to include a cultural component.
Concern was expressed that some
people might not take up the four
year courses w i t h a year i n
continental Europe if student loans
are introduced and the London
factor causes some worry.
Thus 1992 will effect Imperial
College i n some direct ways and
employment prospects will be
improved. Already some companies
from other E C nations are joining in
the milk round. The numbers of
people taking a foreign language
component i n their course is
expected to increase.
