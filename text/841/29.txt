News Review
N E W S
Jan: The UGM to end all UGMs. Abolition defeated by 150 votes.
Opponents of the scheme argue
that loans w i l l discourage
educational participation b y
disadvantaged groups, women and
mature students and they argue that
'top u p loans' are a pre cursor to
abolishing grants altogether.
Marches
The prospect of student loans
even aroused the anger of students
at Imperial College. A n anti loans
lobby formed itself and operated
under the umbrella organisation
'water polo c l u b . ' T h e lobby
presented a n Emergency General
Meeting of the Union with a motion
mandating the Union Executive to
present a petition against loans to a
Parliamentary lobby in January and
calling for the Union to organise a
half day strike, subject to approval
by departmental ballot.
Over 170 students turned u p to
the lobby and, with the support of
the Rector and the Governing Body,
most academic departments
collaborated by cancelling lectures
and tutorials. Before the lobby,
Chairman of the Conservative Party,
M P Peter Brooke put forward the
Government's point of view to the
College. H e argued that loans
would increase access to higher
educataion, reduce pressure on the
parental contribution.
In late January, there was much
uproar when both the National
Union of Students (NUS) and the
University of London Union (ULU)
pulled out of an anti loans march
scheduled for the first of February,
believing that they did not have the
resources to organise the march
safely. Imperial College Union soon
followed suit. The organisation of
the march was taken over by
members of the Federal Campaigns
Committee (FCC), a n informal
group set up by the U L U Presidents
Council, and went ahead as planned
without incident.
Bop against Baker
In February Imperial College
Union joined i n an N U S National
Education Shutdown i n protest to
loans. The shutdown culminated
with 800 students gathering outside
the Department of Education and
Science (DES). A s part of the
protest, the London School of
Economics canceled lectures and
organised a 'Bop against Baker',
University College organised a
picket of the College's entrances,
and an 'Overdraft' disco, Kings
College organised a mail blockage,
whilst catering staff at Thames
Polytechnic staged a one day strike.
A t Imperial, M P Bernie Grant spoke
to 50 students in the Union lounge
while pool a n d table football
tournaments were h e l d a n d
information sheets were distributed.
The union was disappointed that,
because of a low turn out at the
previous N U S March, the College
had refused to rearrange lectures.
In March, the N U S staged its final
anti loans march w h i c h w a s
supported by the Association of
University Teachers and Imperial
College. Over 35,000 students from
all over the country formed a two
mile procession, severely disrupting
London's traffic.
ULU President resigns
From external politics to internal
politics. January saw the resignation
of U L U President, Stewart Jackson
following a narrowly defeated vote
of no confidence i n December. M r
Jackson's resignation followed
accusations that he had taken no
action to support the anti loans
marches, h a d failed to provide
briefings f o r members of the
Executive Senate, and that he had
no regard f o r the U L U vice
presidents.
In an interview with the Times
E d u c a t i o n a l supplement, M r
Jackson said that he had resigned
because of friction which had arisen
because of his right wing views in
a left wing student's union.
'Being a Conservative i n student
politics is like being a fox at a beagle
hunt' he said.
Beijing massacre
The troubles i n China i n June
sparked waves of sympathy from
students i n London. According to
police estimates, 4000 turned up to
a candlelit vigil outside of the
Chinese embassy to p a y their
respects to the 7000 students killed
in the Beijing massacre. Earlier on
the same day the N U S organised a
demonstration attended by 1000
students. The Imperial delegation
placed a wreath on the 'martyrs for
freedom memorial' and presented a
petition of 756 signatures (including
the Rector Professor Eric A s h )
calling for an end to the violence in
C h i n a to embassy officials.
Meanwhile, students at Imperial
signed 432 letters which were
delivered to Sir Geoffrey Howe
calling for the British Government
to openly condemn the actions i n
China. The College, for its part, set
up a hardship fund for Chinese
students with collection boxes
placed i n refectories f o r
contributors.
Geology cutbacks
The U n i v e r s i t y Grants
Committee's ( U G C ) decision to
d o w n g r a d e t h e G e o l o g y
department in January provoked a
strong reaction from members of
staff who claimed that the U G C had
used unfair criteria when making
their assessment.
The department had been told to
lose 10 academic staff and 13 non
academic staff and to reduce its
annual undergraduate intake from
45 to 32 by October 1989. The
cutbacks are likely to lead to the
department having to axe four year
courses and to reduce the number
of options available to second year
geologists from 7 to 3.
Academics i n the department
were critical of the U G C ' s alleged
use of the Science Citation Index as
a means of assessing the quantity of
research at Imperial. They argued
that the index does not take into
account many of the journals which
publish the work from applied
Geology Departments such as
Imperial. They also pointed out that
much of the work carried out is for
industry and hence is not available
for open publication.
