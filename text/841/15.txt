on about 20km of cable but later on
100 k m . The second is much more
interesting. The plan is to deploy the
satellite 100 k m below the shuttle to
an altitude of 130 k m . This will be
the first time this region of the upper
atmosphere has been subject to
extended study; previously it could
only be reached by instrument laden
sounding rockets for a few minutes
at a time. The atmosphere is dense
enough at this altitude for the
satellite to require stabilising vanes.
Already there are plans for an
i m p r o v e d upper atmosphere
satellite, streamlined and equiped
with a cooling system that will
enable it to reach much lower
altitudes; such a system will be very
useful for investigating ozone
depletion a n d the increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gasses
in the atmosphere. A low flying
tethered satellite would also make
an almost ideal platform for military
surveillance although most official
N A S A sources are quite reticent
about this aspect.
The satellite is deployed as shown
in the diagram, from a 12 m boom
extending from the orbiter's payload
so there will be a small inital tension
in the cable to prevent it from
becoming tangled. This is not
enough to unwind the huge cable
drum carried on the orbiter so the
satellite must be deployed initally by
small rocket thrusters. To retrieve it,
it is simply w o u n d in by an electric
motor on the cable drum. The cable
itself is made of several materials
and is very expensive, but a
kilometer of it only weighs slightly
Hess than a k i l o g r a m , a n d
although it is only 4 m m thick, it can
support nearly 30,000 kg.
There are plans to test other
aspects of space tethers in the near
future. The momentum scrounging
technique (see box) is to be tested
using the SEDS (small expendable
deployment system); the idea is to
deploy a 100 kg mass o n a 50 k m
cable which will then be cut,
hopefully giving the mass a 200 m/s
kick which will carry it into an orbit
about 700 k m above the shuttle. This
technique is almost ideal for use
with the space shuttle because most
shuttle payloads are needed in high
orbits while the shuttle needs to get
into a lower orbit for return to earth.
Another application would be with
the supply shuttles to the space
station 'Freedom' (if it is ever built):
It would enable the shuttle to return
to earth without needing to carry
extra fuel for braking rockets and the
station would be given a small boost
to counter the small drag it
experiences in its orbit.
The third tether application to be
tested will be the P M G (plasma
motor generator). The idea is that if
the tether cable is an electrical
conductor, then a large voltage
(around 250 volts per kilometer of
cable) can be produced. In this case,
the difficulty is trying to produce a
useful current from this as you can't
simply string two cables between
the satellites. The ingenious solution
is to collect free electrons at the top
from the surrounding ionosphere
and eject them from the bottom
satellite, creating what is called a
phantom loop. The inital test system
will produce 5 k W of electricity but
later versions could be much larger.
Of course the energy must come
from somewhere; i n this case it
comes from the energy possessed by
the orbiting shuttle which will
slowly drop into a lower orbit when
the P M G is i n use. The change is
however quite small and doesn't
matter much as the shuttles only
stay up for about ten days anyway.
The current plan is to fit a full scale
P M G to the space station to make
use of the energy given to it by
departing supply shuttles.
There are many ideas for the use
of tether systems in the long term
future; many are, to be honest,
cranky. One idea is to connect a
space station in geostationary orbit
to the earth's surface with a cable,
allowing payloads ride into orbit on
board glorified cable cars. Apart
from the fact you need a cable with
a strength to mass ratio about 10,000
times better then the best k n o w n
today, its a neat idea. Other
proposals include a probe, to the
asteroid belt, able to retrieve many
surface samples from different
asteroids by fireing and reeling in a
small penetrator probe and very
high resolution mapping of the
moon and other planets by very low
flying tethered satellites (the military
implications have already been
mentioned).
Tethers basically offer a new way
of doing things in space and hence
will affect almost every aspect of
spaceflight. It is a r a p i d l y
developing aspect of technology
which is being watched with very
keen interest b y the space
community.

What is Nightline?
Nightline is a confidential telephone
service w h i c h provides both
information and non-directive, non-
judgemental counselling. Most
universities and polytechnics in the
U K have their own Nightline service
which runs along similar lines.
Nightline is an organisation run by
students for students—the co-
ordinator, an experienced Nightline
volunteer, holds a sabbatical post
with the University of London.
West London Nightline operates
from 6pm through to 8am every day
during term time. Throughout the
evening there is a female and male
volunteer ready to answer
telephone calls. A s an organisation,
Nightline offers several services to
students:
Entertainments and Information—
This includes details o n cinema,
concerts, theatre, nightclubs and
galleries as well as other events in
London.
Travel Information—There are up-
to-date timetables for the tubes,
trains, and nightbuses.
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Service—This
service has recently been started. It
can be used by students searching
for somewhere to live but relies on
those offering places to live in flat-
shares, shared houses etc.
General C o u n s e l l i n g — T h i s is
offered to students who may be
worried, nervous or anxious about
various issues, such as coursework,
exams, loneliness, friendships,
relationships or sexuality.
Nightline is always looking for
new volunteers who are willing to
help out. If you are interested,
please give us a call, drop us a line
or look out for our Nightline stall at
the Intro Fair.
M y name is Eran Gil—I will be the
sabbatical co-ordinator for Nightline
during 1989-90. Please don't hesitate
to contact me over the summer or
any other time if you have any
questions
