It was sickening, terrifying and all
totally off key. The train pulled into
a station and I jumped out. M y head
ached, my ears ached. Parts of me
I didn't know I had ached. In the
middle of it all I could just see the
crumpled figure of the target. H e
had collapsed. He didn't seem to be
moving or breathing. H e was curled
up into a ball, lying amid the old
crisp packets, drink cans and other
people's copies of the Sun on the
floor of the train.
The doors closed and the train
clattered away.
'Sorry. Should have warned you
about that.' I heard Upton- Park's
voice. H e was standing just behind
me, smirking. 'What did you think?'
'Mortifying! I don't think anyone
deserves that.'
'Well if you ask me, the blighters
deserve whatever's coming to them.
This used to be a decent railway. N o
trouble makers, no hooligans, no
graffiti. A l l we want is a return to
the good old days.
'Of course, we seldom even have
to go as far as Stage one. Often we
try to frighten the troublemakers
away before they even get on trains.
In fact, most of the worst buskers
work for us. A good attack of
"Streets of L o n d o n " is usually
enough.'
There was still one thing that
worried me. H o w on earth do they
tell if someone is going to cause
trouble? I asked Upton- Park.
'It takes many years of practice.
There are certain types of people.
People w h o are not quite normal
like us: who do not respect the great
British traditions, our customs, our
way of life'. H e started to h u m the
N a t i o n a l A n t h e m a g a i n . I
interrupted h i m .
'People w h o do not stand for the
National A n t h e m , ' he snapped. 'I
think these people are parasites o n
society. That's the difference
between us and that other group,
the so-called Guardian Angels. We
stand for what's right!'
A train arrived, Upton-Park
jumped on board and clattered
away to his wife and 1.8 children in
Surbiton.
This may be considered offensive
It was with great sadness that I
learnt, last week, about the decision,
by council, to change the nature of
the editorial control over the Rag
Mag. This will drastically change the
way i n which the Rag M a g is
perceived by students and will, in
due course, affect the Imperial
College Rag Mag's ability to sell
itself, and Imperial College's
notoriety amongst Britain's other
students.
The changes were d e e m e d
necessary to avoid the bad publicity
in the press, and future threats of
legal action as have been received
this year, and in previous years.
However, no clean up action will be
effective against the increasingly
reactionary students movement.
The Rag M a g is, after all a
publication which is circulated on
behalf of IC students, and as editor
I would have expected anyone
w i t h i n College w h o f o u n d it
offensive to be the first to react,
since a substantial number were
sold here long before the rest of the
country had a sniff. Indeed the
entire incident is the result of a
w r i t t e n c o m p l a i n t f r o m one
University (Keele) and hence its
Area N U S , and unsubstantiated
rumour circulated in The Times H E S
that we were to be prosecuted under
the Race Relations Act.
The changes themselves are; the
inclusion of a ' T h i s may be
considered offensive' warning on
the cover, a section printed on blue
paper containing jokes which are
offensive to a 'normal' person, and
e x p a n d i n g the censorship
committee. The warning on the
cover is not going to hurt the Rag
Mag too much, in fact it will increase
sales by a significant amount, so I
am not worried about this. It
nevertheless shows the unqualified
and misguided views which the
supporters of the doctrine hold. If
they seriously believe that this 'well
we did warn you' approach is going
to stop people w r i t i n g to
newspapers a n d the U n i o n
President, to complain, then they
have no idea how these types of
people react. They are people who
want to f i n d Rag M a g s ,
newspapers, television, etc
offensive, they uphold the rights of
individuals to have freedom from
so-called persecution, whilst they
crucify others for exercising freedom
of speech.
These people will react in the
same way to the blue section, and
although they will be warned not to
read it if they are 'normal', who can
resist forbidden fruit, and again they
are not going to refrain from
complaining. Anyway, what is a
normal person?
All of this pales into insignificance
if the third change works in the way
it is intended to. The addition of the
Women's Officer, an Overseas'
Students Rep, a Religious Rep, and
a Homosexual Rep, I think is the
final nail in the coffin for the IC Rag
Mag we all know and love. I do not
say this because I want a bigoted
and ultra-offensive Rag Mag, far
from it, I believe balance i n
houmour is the important factor.
Virtually every joke on Earth plays
on somebody's misfortune or their
position as a social minority of some
sort, in fact, most of these jokes
originate from within these groups
themselves. Let's face it, the best
Yiddish jokes are told by Jews.
Nazis, Arabs and the National Front
merely go out and kill them.
Humour always works as a way of
defusing social tension. I reluctantly
accept that in principle a censorship
committee is necessary, to
sometimes provide an alternative
perspective for the editor. By
specifically introducing 'minority'
interests onto a committee that
s h o u l d be objective a n d
representative of the populace, one
replaces balance with banality. It is
a fact that everyone gets a thrill by
being shocked.
I think it is important to appreciate
the type of people that will react to
publication, naturally they are in
positions of power in their Unions,
but are representing the feelings of
their members? I have sold several
hundred rag mags this year, in total
4,500 have been distributed, we
have received two w r i t t e n
complaints a n d t w o verbal
complaints. Yet dozens of ordinary
students c o u n t r y - w i d e have
enthusiastically bought IC Rag Mags
on the strength of previous issues
(notably not last years). A n d people
rushed after us to buy copies when
their friends showed them what was
available. C o m m e n t s received
included: 'It had better be an
improvement on the shit our Union
puts out.'
I appreciate that it is the JC Rag
Mag, and that the IC Rag committee
have recommended the changes,
and that the IC President has
received complaints, but who has
sold the past four or five editions of
the Rag Mag? It's the C C U ' s
particularly R C S U Rag. If IC Rag
don't like the content let the C C U ' s
be a front for the Rag M a g , and
operate through IC Charity Rag.
The article written in The Times
by the N U S Vice President even
went as far as to question the need
for rag mags, and by implication
Rag, as a fund-raising machine, and
hoped for the fund-raising needs of
the world to be met by mega-events
such as Comic Relief, and Live A i d .
Mega events raise money for mega
charities, little events raise money
for little charities. Let everyone raise
what they can, how ever they can.
It has been shown in the past that
there is a market for IC Rag Mags
and their ilk (such as the Medical
School editions), we have the largest
geographic sales, let us pander to
the market. IC should not knuckle
under to the bully boys 'levellers'
who dictate how we should think,
we are free spirits and should not
play lap-dog to the N U S and its
cronies!
