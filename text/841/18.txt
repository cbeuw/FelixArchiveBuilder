Opinion
science, could most certainly make
the grade as professional musicians.
Yet it remains true that there are
many who are untouched by the
sports, the politics, micro and
macro, by the social life of the
College. It is true that Imperial
College would be a better place if
more could be persuaded to
participate. The theory that we are
exacerbating the problem by our
student selection procedures does
not bear examination. We are
certainly d o i n g m u c h more
interviewing than we d i d three
years ago. But there would be no
point in selecting for social graces at
the expense of academic
performance. It would be totally
irresponsible were we to accept
students w h o would then have
difficulty i n f o l l o w i n g o u r ,
admittedly exceedingly tough,
courses.
Of course it helps if, like St Mary's
there are 25 viable applicants for
every place. The selectors there (as
amply displayed i n a series of T V
programmes) are able to go for
academic excellence—plus some
additional talent. Their students'
success i n sports and i n the arts is
striking. It would help the whole of
Imperial College a great deal if we
could engender closer contact
between the t wo Unions. The
obstacles, as far as I can understand
them, appear to be of a somewhat
theological nature. Once again k.a.
is not going to get us over that
hurdle.
I get the impression that Dave
B u r n s divides non-academic
pursuits into Good Things and Bad
Things. Visiting museums and
theatres I read as Bad; rowing is
tolerated; but it is "student activity
around the College" that seems to
earn his accolade. But w h y choose?
Beer, partners and song are not
alternatives. T h e y c a n prove
mutually supportive even, i n
moderation of course, supportive of
the academic work.
So how can we achieve a greater
participation? I would suggest a
good start might be for the

commanding heights of the student
body—the Union and FELIX—to
devote themselves more to that
cause. I have not found much i n
FELIX towards this end. Too much
of the time one gets the impression
of a rather small number of people
conversing, all too often ascribing
the worst possible motives to each
other in the process. N o w there are
some people in the world who really
are b... .ds, but, when you examine
the situation carefully not really that
many. If one starts w i t h the
tentative assumption that most
people are not b ....ds, it can do
wonders for getting things d o n e -
such as recruiting our students, to
our society.
The students could do a lot—but
so could we, on the academic staff.
Our abortive discussions with
R H B N C contained an element of
this thinking. A future with R H B N C
w o u l d i n d e e d have changed
Imperial College—but then change
is the only certainty, nostalgia for
one's youth the main deterrrent. It
did not come off, for a number of
practical reasons—but I think it was
worth probing.
A major departure, which I
believe will have beneficial effects on
our community, is the incidence of
four-year courses, with one year to
be spent abroad. M y personal guess
is that such courses will become
available in most departments; that
a very significant fraction of the
students will opt to join them.
More immediately there is a
growing recognition that not only
are our courses intellectually very
demanding—they should be—but
they are also stuffed full of too much
material. A t base, it is the result of
w o r k i n g i n fields i n w h i c h
knowledge and understanding is
accumulating with such frightening
speed. It would not be a problem in
a Department of Greek Philology.
The temptation is to respond by
putting more into the courses. The
problem was highlighted by the
Undergraduate Studies Committee.
H a p p i l y , remedial p r u n i n g is
progressing rapidly throughout the
College. It should yield some more
waking hours, which could be
d e v o t e d to non-academic
pursuits....
Dave Burns concludes with an
inspiring coda. I am glad that he has
"fallen i n love with the place...",
though I would suggest that he
might try to be just a shade less
critical of anyone else he might fall
in love with next. I am glad that he
has such a vivid sense for the history
of the College; that he retains good
memories.
Which takes me to m y title. W h y
leave? True there is that degree to
take away; there is the Sponsor who
has been patiently awaiting your
maturity, for you to take your place
in the defence of the nation. But the
contribution which you could make
to the College now, as an alumnus,
is enormous. Y o u may, for a while,
until that first grey hair appears,
have more opportunities to
influence Union thinking than you
did f r o m the hustings. W e
desperately need young talent in the
Alumnus Association. Yes, we are
asking them for money—for the
very first time (with student housing
one of the main aims...). But we
want a lot more from alumni than
their financial support. W e want
their active participation towards
retaining a n d e n h a n c i n g the
academic reputation of the College,
towards making it a more exciting
place to study, inspiring it towards
providing greater opportunities for
a fuller existence, for everyone who
is of our community.
