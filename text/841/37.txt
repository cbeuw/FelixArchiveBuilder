The Merchant
of Venice
PHOENIX THEATRE
Sir Peter Hall's eagerly awaited
production of Merchant continues a
trend these days of m a k i n g
Shakespeare more accessible to the
public v i a large West E n d
productions, this one certainly does
not disappoint.
Critics have been sharpening their
knives ever since Dustin Hoffman
first announced he was to play the
great theatrical protagonist,
Shylock. But here there is little to
complain about, a n d much to
praise.
The story is one of love, prejudice,
money and revenge. It tells of how
Bassanio, a Venetian w h o is
impoverished by prodigality, raises
money through his friend Antonio,
to go and woo Portia in Belmont,
Antonio himself borrows the money
from Shylock and guarantees the
loan with a pound of his flesh—a
The Tempest
BARBICAN
The Tempest has been performed
four times i n the last eighteen
months in London, but none have
been as inspired as the R S C
production.
We start with the storm scene
done i n slow motion so that we can
actually hear the words—ingenius.
A billowing sail overshadows the
sailors as they sway rhythmically to
the wracks of thunder, then, all of
a sudden, the sails are swallowed
up and the stage is transformed into
an island—a magnificent white oval
stage.
John W o o d plays the best
Prospero * I have yet seen. H e
summons his enemies to the island
using his magical powers, but his
motives for revenge give way to
humanity and forgiveness. Prospero
is in command of everything except
his o w n divided self. Wood's deep
vibrato voice gives every word both
power and expression.
Desmond Barrit plays a roly-poly,
effeminate Trinculo, whose scenes
with Stephano a n d a hideous
monstrous Caliban have never been
funnier.
The music is wonderfully wierd
and the magical effects are superb.
The production stresses all that is
good about the play—it's chimerical,
dream-like quality, the powerful yet
vulnerable aspect of Prospero's
character, the pathetic humour of
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano,
and the innocent love of Miranda.
But above all, what makes the play
so effective is its air of wondrous
magic and illusion.
bond regarded as a joke.
While Bassanio wins Portia,
Antonio fails to meet his bond and
so Shylock, long-time sufferer at the
hands of Christians, claims his
pound of flesh. In the ensuing
courtroom scene Portia disguises
herself as a lawyer a n d wins
Antonio's case.
The production and performances
are a delight to watch. A permanent
set, consisting simply of columns
enclosing the acting area is
instantaneously a n d unfussily
changed back and forth between
Venice a n d B e l m o n t . Its
transformations are so swiftly
achieved, using excellent lighting
techniques, that the scenes virtually
merge into one another, allowing

Hoffman
A Midsummer
Night's Dream
OPEN AIR THEATRE, REGENTS
PARK
The Dream played in the park is quite
the most appealing production I
have yet seen. The setting is ideal—
the chirping of birds, the swaying
of trees i n a gentle breeze and a
production that goes all out to both
please and be daringly different. A t
first, I felt uncomfortable at the sight
of hippies dancing around a n d
flicking peace signs, but then it
became clear that setting the play in
the 1967 Summer of Love suited the
innocent h e d o n i s m of t h e
characters.
It seems silly to have Saeed Jaffrey
as a maharish, Oberon and a sexpot
Titania played by Sally Dexter, but
somehow it all seems to work.
Christopher Benjamin plays a
Felicity
plump bumpkin Bottom—a constant
source of hilarity, and between
scenes we are entertained by the
sounds of "The Beatles', 'Simon &
Garfunkel', 'Procol Harem', etc.
The comic finale is the
performance of Pyramus and Thisbe
by Bottom and his cohorts. This is
a wonderful celebration of amateur
theatricals. The chilliness of the
night air is quite forgotten as we are
beset b y muscle w r e n c h i n g
laughter. The spirit of Shakespeare
is preserved, and yet we cannot
recognise it as Shakespeare.
The entertainment value cannot
be overstated. It is great fun. This
is a perfect i n t r o d u c t i o n to
Shakespeare for those who have
not, as yet, revelled in the Bard's
work, a n d it is an immensely
enjoyable night out, as long as the
weather behaves.
A Midsummer Night's Dream plays
repertoire with Twelfth Night and
The Swaggerer.
Other
Productions
Much Ado About Nothing
(Strand)—Joyous, uplifting, often
hilarious comedy. Well acted and
produced with superb performances
from Alan Bates and Felicity Kendal.
Great fun.
Sherlock Holmes, the Musical
(Cambridge Theatre)—Shallow
cockney musical, only serves as
tourist fodder.
the entire play to move forward
w i t h remarkable fluidity a n d
rhythmic ease.
Hoffman's Shylock is a light-
weight characterisation. In his first
scene he smiles and is non-assertive.
This Shylock is a rational, humane
creature, his humour ironic, his
manner conciliatory. This eventually
leads us to doubt that such a man
would thrust a knife into Antonio's
heart, even after all the humiliation
he has suffered. The subtlety which
Hoffman injects into his poignant
'Hath not a Jew eyes...' speech is
pure genius. We are given to fully
sympathise with Shylock at the end.
When he is forced to give up his
religion, we feel that the injustice is
too great.
Geraldine James as Portia radiates
intelligence a n d strength of
character. She dictates her will with
forceful, lucid exposition. Nathaniel
Parker makes a roguish Bassanio.
With h i m we are repulsed at his
wanton excesses, but cannot help
but find his boyish charm appealing.
The ensemble cast are just about
perfect in their roles. Only is the fool
Launcelot G o b b o wasted
somewhat.
The limited run of fifteen weeks
is completely sold out, but returns
can be obtained if you queue for
long enough. It's well worth it.
King John
BARBICAN—THE PIT
The plot of King John deals with the
see-saw of power between France
and England,
John is played by short, stocky
Nicholas Woodeson. H i s
performance is excellent, forever
devising plans of political gain, and
obsessed with power (so much so,
that he keeps his crown on a chain).
The set is left bare, apart from a
wall of ladders leaning against the
balcony—strange but effective.
This is a confident production that
makes one wonder why the play is
not performed more often—a credit
to Deborah Warner's direction.
Metropolis (Piccadilly Theatre)—
Great sets and special effects, shame
about the music and story.
Aspects of Love (Prince of Wales)—
Boring story, dull music, foppish
forgettable trash.
American Bagpipes (Royal Court)—
Charming Glaswegian comedy. Fast
pacey dialogue keeps things
interesting.
