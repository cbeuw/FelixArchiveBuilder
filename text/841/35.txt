Fair Game Tap
A t a time i n cinema development
when almost every movie can be
bracketed, (as a baseball film, or a
role reversal, and so on), Fair Game
falls into the category 'damned
peculiar'.
The blurb says 'psychological
thriller', but for much of the eighty
minutes I was tempted to say
'blurb!'. A n d at the e n d I left

however it wasn't that bad.

minutes, when his deadly black
mamba bites him. This allows the
nasty, Gene, to take the snake and
play a trick o n his estranged wife
Eva. H e leaves it i n her loft
apartment. Serves the bitch right for
abandoning the possessive bastard.
Ha! What a wheeze.
Anyway, it's one of those cat and
mouse affairs. The mamba will die
of its o w n poison i n one hour. Eva
doesn't k n o w this, but we do, and
so does Gene, w h o , being a

progress electronically.
O n the face of it, tension and
excitement could be abundant if
played correctly. Unfortunately
Gorgio Maroder's score attempts to
sustain the anxiety for the full eighty
minutes, rather than taking snaps at
it every so often.
Gregg Henry plays Gene solidly,
if a little two dimensionally, but he
is threateningly oppressive. Trudie
Styler is rather more efficient as Eva,
and manages to show contempt,
fear and strength despite a poor

You've got Tap! It's a pity the
bandwaggon ground to a halt a few
years back.
In the spirit of its contemporary
predecessor there are ample
opportunities i n the script for the
cast to break into a 'duelling banjos'
routine. It must be said that all
concerned are pretty good at tap

script consisting mostly of 'fuck!'.
Where the film surpasses itself is
in the set: a rumbling cascade of arty
visuals that makes u p Eva's home.
(She's a sculptress, you see.) N o
minimalist refuge of yuppiedom
this, it's like an aircraft hanger, full
of bits of other buildings, and even
complete with mini-tropical rain
forest. Quite appropriate
considering Styler is Sting's
girlfriend.
A l l i n all it isn't a bad attempt,
given that it represents Italian
director M a r i a O r f i n i ' s first
international film. I find it hard to
see where the £4 million went,
though. Compare it to the similarly
budgeted Nightmare on Elm Street 4
and look at the effects they got for
their money. Perhaps the snake
commands a large fee and slice of
the box office.
Fair Game will suffer from its
blockbuster competition, proving
that drawing the crowds can often
dancing, and not bad when it comes
to acting either.
Gregory Hines takes the lead as
Max Washington, an ex-con intent
on forgetting his tap roots. Sammy
Davis Jr plays his surrogate father,
an old-time dancer with dreams of
rejuvinating the craft. 'Nobody ever
tap danced to rock music'. H i s
daughter A m y provides the film
with love-hate romantic interest and
gives M a x the necessary Jiminy
Cricket conscience.
The plot, insofar as one exists,
deals with the conflicts i n Max's
character. He has the opportunity of
rebuilding a life of crime with his old
acquaintances i n gangland, or he
can scrape a living o n the stage.
Tough choice. What we have then
is a pleasant journey of dilemma
a n d s o l u t i o n , quandary a n d
triumph.
The direction captures the moods
of the various scenes as it flicks
effortlessly f r o m smooth

a piece of cinema art, it is well

But with a potentially specific

what you earn that matters.'

A Madhouse
in Goa
A P O L L O T H E A T R E
Insanity is the best escape from
madness. This is the maxim which
drives the major characters i n
M a r t i n S h a r m a n ' s n e w p l a y .
Personal insanity b e i n g the
inevitable consequence of trying to
make sense of a m a d w o r l d .
Bewildered by pessimistic visions of
personal demise a n d global
apocalypse they are either driven or
gladly volunteer to leap with gusto
completely off their rockers.
Such a premise should make for
some very comic opportunities and
these are brought out in abundance
here. A little patience is required
though to await the full fruitition of
these as the slower first half of the
double bill lazily sows the seeds.
To outline the plot in detail would
detract from this later reward. I
therefore take m y lead from thei
excellent programme to the piece
which tries, with great success, to
give a flavour of the two locations.
This is accomplished with quotes
from Lawrence Durrell's The Greek
Islands describing both Corfu and
Santorini.
The essence of these images of
light and heat freezing a timeless
sanctuary of Platonic immutability
is captured brilliantly by Ultze's sun
baked sets and Gerry Jenkinson's
magnesium bright lighting. The first
set at C o r f u has the greater
whitewashed intensity and with it
the greater stillness. The impression
here is less of a madhouse and more
of an asylum. A n asylum from the
demands of the outside world.
One of those seeking sanctuary
here is David (Rupert Graves). H e
is a young, painfully shy and artistic
homosexual American Jew. This
might seem a parodic combination
indeed it draws a few laughs i n
itself. One must only remember
however that Sherman himself is all
of these things but young to see that
sympathy rather than stereotype is
the source of this character. The
other protagonist is M r s Honey
(Vanessa Redgrave) an American
spinster a n d a globe-trotting
eccentric. Losbos and Nikos are
owner and waiter, respectively, of
this paradise pension and complete
the tranquil picture. But, add a little
intrigue and events take a sinsister
turn.
In the Santorini based second half
we have really arrived i n bedlam.
From this madman's eyrie we are
treated to a fantastic view of the
world twenty four years on in 1990.
This panoramic parody of all things
absurd i n the modern world must
surely be a vision of the paranoid.
But when you're laughing with
madmen you should be prepared
for a shock.
Performances in both part one and
part two are exceptional for their
measured restraint. Strong directing
from Robert Allan Ackerman is
doubtless to be credited for this.
Particularly outstanding is Arthur
Dignam as the crazy old man in part
two. Mystical yet profound when
animated and convincingly vacant
when crushed the man makes a
natural nutter. See this now, it's an
absolute treat.
