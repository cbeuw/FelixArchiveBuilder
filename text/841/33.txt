Welfare
receiving Income Support the
Benefit will still be paid to you by
the Unemployment Benefit Office
usually over two weeks. If you have
any change in circumstances which
you think may affect your claim
then you must inform both the U B O
and the DSS.
Overseas students and the summer
vacation
A n overseas student who stays in
the U K during the summer may be
able to work or claim benefit
depending on their conditions of
stay in this country. E C nationals
and students from Iceland, Malta,
Norway, Sweden and Turkey are
entitled to claim Income Support
during the summer but may be i n
breach of their conditions of stay if
they do so. This is because these
benefits are classed as 'public funds'
and in some cases a claim can
jeopardise an extension of stay if the
Local Authority or D S S notifies the
Home Office.
As regards vacation employment
it will depend whether your visa
states that you are allowed to work.
If an overseas student is not sure
what his or her position is regarding
work then they should seek advice.
Generally speaking most overseas
students are not allowed to work i n
this country without permission.
You could seriously jeopardise your
leave to remain in the U K if you take
employment without a permit.
Claiming Housing Benefit when
you're unemployed.
When you receive your B2 form you
will find a from inside with which
to claim Housing Benefit. Y o u
should complete this and send it
together with proof of your rent to
your local H B Office. There is no
need to send proof of your income
as the D S S will send a 'certificate'
to the Housing Benefit Office stating
that you are in receipt of Income
Support.
A claimant in receipt of Income
Support is entitled to 100% rebate
of eligible rent (rent, rates, water
rates, gas, electricity etc.) and 80%
rebate of eligible rates.
Other points to remember
If for any reason your claim for
benefit is refused you have a right
of appeal which you must exercise
within 28 days of receipt of the
decision.
If you are in receipt of Income
Support y o u are automatically
entitled to help with N H S charges
eg Prescriptions, dental charges,
eyesight test etc.
If you go away at any time during
your claim you must inform the
Unemployment Office. If you go on
holiday in this country you will still
be entitled to benefit as long as you
do not say away from the area in
which you are claiming for more
