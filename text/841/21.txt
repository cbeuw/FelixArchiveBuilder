BulbQuest
•
No, you're still in the Union Building and the
light bulb has blown. You are about to embark
on an even more difficult, dangerous and
exciting adventure: The Quest for the
Replacement Bulb. Go to 30
m
You arrive at the FELIX Office with an article
complaining about the difficulty of getting a
light bulb changed in the Union Building and ask
the FELIX Editor to print it in the next issue. He
agrees, and asks you to come and help collate.
If you want to help, go to 43, if, like most other
people, you can't be bothered, go to 18

As you are walking up the stairs you tread on
a small screw dropped by a careless electrician.
You fall to the foot of the stairs, arriving at the
bottom at the same time as an workman
carrying a saw. You receive a nasty cut to your
upper arm, and an ambulance is called to take
you to hospital before you bleed to death. The
ambulance arrives, you are put inside and
driven at high speed towards the hospital. En
route to the hospital, a small dog runs out in
front of the ambulance which swerves, goes
out of control, and crashes into a parked car.
Stunned and shaken, but still alive, you crawl
out from the broken wreckage. As you stagger
away, the petrol tank explodes, showering
burning fuel everywhere and badly singein
your eyebrows. This distracts you from looki
where you are going, as a result of which y
step on a banana skin and fail down an o.
manhole into a sewer where you are eaten a _
by mutant piranha rats. Not only that, you h « t
also lost the game. Looks like this just isn't yip
lucky day.
You leave the lecture several hours later
convinced that you are a frog. You hop along
the walkway and out onto Exhibition Road
where you are run over by a Juggernaught.
The game is over.
Three hours later you stagger out of the HUB
Office, dazed, shaken and unable to remember
anything that the Rector's wife has said. You
wander home and collapse in bed for a few
days to recover. Feeling better now? Good, in
that case you can now go to 52
[¥]
The Editor deliberately loses your article. Do
you complain (go to 50) or just resubmit it (go
to 55)?
You find yourself in a tutorial. Before you can
think of a suitable excuse to leave early, you
die of boredom.
You have lost the game.

Well done! By an amazing coincidence
everybody who needed to sign the form was
in today and you now have a completed R27b.
Unfortunately supplies are out of bulbs and will
have no more available until 5th August 2056,
Go to 30.

You enter the hallowed portals of the Union
Office. A jolly lady holding a glass of sherry
comes out to meet you. If you are a member
of industrial society, go to 23. Lower mortals
go to 7.

You arrive at the HUB Office, but before you
can say a word.the Rectors wife demands
£100,000 in payment for the new lighting
system. You can either run for it (go to 41) or
try to explain that you only wanted a light bulb
changed (go to 56).
Your bank manager will not like this at all and
you are left wondering how so few people can
drink so much. Anyway, the Committee
decides to forward your case to the light bulb
sub-committee. Go to 42.
You write a letter to the Rector's wife stating
that she can go and whistle for the money as
you have emigrated to Bolivia.The Careers
Service is shut down to pay for the lighting
system and you have won the game.

You end up in a long corridor with large
numbers of featureless locked doors. You can
either go left to 12, or right to 58.

Three weeks later, the LHSTTFL BRFSSSC
informs you that there is insufficient finance to
purchase the necessary equipment. Do you go
to the bar to drown your sorrows (go to 21) or
try again (go back to 30).
Good taste forbids us from describing what you
see. Return to 7 in embarrassment and disgust.
[¥|
You go down the featureless corridor, which
zigzags through the Sherfield building past
numerous locked doors. Finally you come to a
sign which says 'To The HUB Office' You can
follow the sign to 6, or go in the opposite
direction, which should bring you to 34.
After waiting only three quarters of an hour,
you have been handed a magnificent 12"
Belushi's Pizza. It is only slightly cold. You try
not to think of Listeria as you look at the tuna
topping, and you poke a slice of onion to make
sure it wasn't wriggling of its own accord. You
do wish the tomato sauce had not been quite
such a vivid shade of grey.
You pluck up your courage and attack the
pizza with a plastic knife and fork. Both
dissolve. You take a bite and collapse retching
to the floor.
'Didn't you enjoy your meal, sir', is the last
thing you remember hearing before everything
went black. Go to 54.
You are in the Sherfield building. There is a sign
on the wall saying 'To The HUB Office' You can
follow the sign (go to 6) or go in the opposite
direction (go to 34)
