Le Ballet du Yargistan
than the unintentionally so. Samuel
Beckett was the obvious man to
oblige and so to the Young Vic for
his Waiting for Godot. Like an
adolescent's reading of Nausea this
play was enough to leave anyone
cold. It's poetry scanned every icy
place that hadn't been sucked into
the vortex of Joyce's Ulysses. I'm still
on the look out for productions of
Beckett's Endgame and Happy Days
to trace the progressive stripping
away of language by the fear of
imperfect expression. A s it was I
made do with his first novel Murphy
and i n sympathy with his slide
towards silence I decided to return
to Dance.
A h the refreshment, as the
springtime sounds of Paris came to
The Place that April. First I went, for
my sins, to Confesse. Herve Jourdet
understood, as only a lapsed
Catholic can, the almost sexual
tension that fills the obsessive detail
of religious rites. A young priest
instructing a trainee n u n made a
recipe for temptation. The pair
crossed themselves frantically as the
attraction between them swelled
and leached out their guilt. By the
grace of G o d and the beady eye of
a Mother Superior/Mother Church
figure swaddled i n all modest
prudery, they were saved from their
evil flirtation. Averse D'Octobre the
second Jourdet piece was a chance
for a little lighter fun and a great
opportunity to hear more of the
swirling sounds of spring from
B r u n o P r i e r y ' s accordion.
Apparently it was the first time out
of France for this farmer/musician
and it sounded like he might still
have been there.
By this time I was desperate to
lure more friends into my growing
addiction as m y first attempt had
been a complete disaster. I had
dragged along a couple of guys to
The Sneeze at the Aldwych. Thinking
that you couldn't go too far wrong
with Chekhov and certainly with
what was billed as four comic
sketches. I was horrified to see the
result. Michael Frayn had made
some misguided attempt to adapt
pieces that Chekhov admitted he
had 'knocked together'. Rowan
Atkinson pulled i n the crowds but
couldn't make much of any of it. O h
dear it was going to be hard to drag
those two out again.
It was getting worse n o w as I
discovered y o u c o u l d go to
lunchtime theatre as well. A t the
Cafe Theatre Upstairs above the
Bear and Staff at Leicester Square,
Pirandello's short play proved a
good way to pass a lunchbreak. Not
to mention the pint before and after
The Man with the Flower in his Mouth.
The Artaud Company were as
convivial and generous as they
seemed disorganised: unable to put
on the other short piece by the
Marquis de Sade we got i n to the
Pirandello free.
The spring months were flooded
with fantastic dance opportunities^
so I had to pack some more into my
time. Back at The Place the
Dutchman W i m Vandekeybus put
on an amazing show entitled What
the Body Does Not Remember. Seated
towards the back of the stage a
figure slapped out a rhythm on a
table and the amplified sound rung
around the theatre. O n the stage in
front was a grid marked out by
powerful footlights, two men rolled
around this grid i n time with the
movement of the hands. They
collapsed as the palms slapped flat
and arched as the puppeteer's
fingertips summoned them up.
The second stark piece was an
exercise i n timing and trust as the
company tossed polystyrere blocks
around with reckless abandon.
Intercepting the valuable slabs for
which they competed each of them
struggled to lay out some kind of
private pathway. A pathway to
During the recent exam period I
went o n a veritable binge. A T C ' s
adapation of Antony and Cleopatra at
the Lyric justified the title inversion
to Cleopatra and Antony. But I
couldn't see that it warranted the
critical praise that had been lavished
upon it and my feelings about the
art of 'interpretation' were
reinforced.
Finding a couple of venues as
close as the Fulham Road was a
treat. Marlowe's Doctor Faustus
summoning the devil to The Lost
Theatre and The Rose Tavern trying
to appeal with As You Like It.
Further afield in Islington was
another of my favourite kind of
venues; the ones with good beer on
tap. A t the Kings Head Coward's
Peace in Our Time was an unexpected
pleasure and encouraged me to
check out his Blithe Spirit just
recently. (I must catch The Vortex too
which is till going strong at The
Garrick.)
So, it's the summer now, and
how the hell am I going to get
through it? There's an incredible
Spanish company La Tartana Teatro

do something amazing I hear with
tons of sand, water and giant
puppets. I've been promising
myself some Shakespeare and I'm

where was not so clear.
The third piece was a flutter of
bath towels and flashing glimpses
of flesh. The dancers criss-crossed
on near collision courses snatching
and swapping their items of dress
as they went.

du Fargistan at The Place I caught
them at Waterman's as I wrote in a
