Profile
Will the real Bill Goodwin please stand up?
Who is this Bill Goodwin guy anyway? What did
he do in his year as FELIX Editor, and what was
he like to work for? Staff member and FELIX
Business Manager Liz Warren investigated the
man behind the cat and reviews his
achievements.
Bill Goodwin has been described as
shy and unassuming. It is certainly
true that he has not had a high
public profile in his year as FELIX
Editor. People coming into the
FELIX Office for the first time almost
always end up addressing someone
other than Bill. Of course this could
be due to his consummate skill in
delegating all work to his staff to
avoid doing any himself.
He has had a varied a n d
interesting 'career' at College,
including being in QTSoc and
indulging his taste for doing very
odd and pointless things and
standing for the post of Union
President and becoming President
Elect for approximately 48 hours,
only to be disqualified. It's nice to
see that he has finally managed to
fulfil both ambitions by swapping
jobs with this year's president for a
week.
Despite his attempts at anon-
ymity, he has become well known
amongst certain parts of IC, namely
those people he has annoyed this
year. These are too numerous to
mention but number much of the
College hierarchy, several heads of
departments, U n i o n Office
sabbaticals, various Union hacks
and several religious, social and
over-dramatic societies. The sad
aspect of this for Bill is that he rarely
intended to annoy any of these
people and that most of the people
he deliberately set out to enrage
have failed to react in any way.
Another characteristic Bill has
become renowned for is his stout
defence of FELIX and the freedom
of the press against all comers. In
fact he sems to have spent a lot of
this year d e f e n d i n g various
freedoms: the freedom to be bored
senseless by U G M s , the freedom for
STOIC, IC Radio (Commerical Free)
and FELIX to determine their o w n
content without interference from
capitalist bourgeois exploiters (sorry,
Sydney Harbour-Bridge)...I think it
would do Bill some good to go and
remind himself of the poster the
FELIX Printer, Dean, has hanging
by the litho: 'The freedom of the
press is controlled by those who
work the presses'. Fortunately Bill
can operate the litho himself and
this has proved very useful when
printing the front page at one
o'clock in the morning.
Something that the staff will
remember Bill for is his
perfectionism. This has deteriorated
If's lonely at the top.
over the year as he has been forced
to realise that he cannot do
everything to the standards he
would like without forcing himself
and his staff to take no sleep at all.
He has become k i n d hearted
enough to allow us all to go home
for four hours sleep a week. This
lightening of attitude has not
permeated as far as the news pages.
Bill will insist on writing every word
himself, insist that he has to write
fifteen stories to fill two pages and
then discover (by this time it is
midnight on Thursday, and the
collators have finished the rest of
FELIX and are fretting for the front
page) that there's only space for half
of them and that he need not have
written them all.
Another of Bill's endearing (?)
qualities is his boundless
pessimism. 'We'll never get it ready
on time' he will mutter gloomily on
Tuesday afternoon only to find on
Wednesday m o r n i n g that the
newspaper fairy has mysteriously
arrived in the night and pasted up
all but three pages. The only reason
FELIX is late is his aforementioned
obsession with news.
Enough of that. The FELIX Office
has been a very exciting place to
work this year because Bill's style of
'management' has been to
encourage all the staff to do
whatever interests them most and
allow them to use some of the more
technical pieces of machinery. This
has made working in the FELIX
Office educational as well as fun.
Bill would admit that this strategy
was as much out of necessity as
design as he started the year with
only three regular members of staff
from the previous year. The strain
of producing his freshers' issue
nearly single-handedly has taken its
toll. Apparently there was a time
when Bill was calm and organised
and the Office was tidy. The staff
who have joined since the start of
this year can only believe this to be
a piece of misreporting and a factual
inaccuracy.
Bill has also been drawn into one
of the favourite comforts of many
previous Editors: alcohol. He is
reputed to have begun the year as
a sober and abstemious soul but was
gradually led down the slippery
slope of indulgence. He is believed
to have been corrupted chiefly by
his Business Manager, but she
claims he was quite corrupt when
she first met him and didn't need
any help at all. Bill has vague
memories of the many embarrassing
acts he has committed whilst under
the influence this year, but the fact
that he is editing this article means
they will remain unpublished. A t
least for now...
Seriously, Bill has been a great
person to work with: encouraging,
enthusiastic and only occasionally a
miserable sod. The FELIX Staff wish
him good luck as he leaves to
become a real journalist and breathe
a sigh of relief that they can get rid
of h i m at last.
