A Rake's
Progress
People whinge about London when
really they are talking about another
city. They mean the dirty hectic
metropolis that is London without
its soul, its guts and the greater part
of its alimentary canal: I mean, of
course, the theatre.
N o w I'm not a 'Theatre-Goer' nor
is there any such species (Phantom
of the Opera fans excepted perhaps).
But I like my mind and my senses
to be jolted into action once in a
while and if ever there was a place
and a time to jump start the neurons
in your noddle it was London in
'88/'89.
Alan Ayckbourn was the first to
take the jump-leads to my body. I
was drawn to see his Henceforward
at Richmond Theatre (still playing
at the Vaudeville with a new cast)
by a vague nostalgia for an old habit.
Somewhere between the base of the
seat and the tip of the funny bone
went two hundred and forty volts,
more than enough to tickle the
alcohol smothered synapse
guarding the only surviving route to
a fold marked 'Do Not Open'. Firing
on at least two cylinders and as oiled
as a lager lout I uttered those cliched
words T really ought to do this more
often'. It was the beer talking but I'd
never heard a pint of Fosters make
so much sense.
In order to ensure that I'd got the
message right, I decided to check
with another antipodean oracle by
the name of Castlemaine at a pub
called the Orange Tree a little way
up the road. A s surely as I downed
the third pint of liquid gold, I saw
the sign that read "Theatre club': it
was ordained.
In a small space above the pub I
discovered that night what seemed
like an intimate bedroom scene.
Love, betrayal a n d incestuous
longings were played out with
ferocious passion untempered by
the presence of a hundred pairs of
eyes. Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles
had been staged as it ought to be,
inescapable and taught.
That night settled the matter and
convinced me to cross the Rubicon
(just west of Waterloo Bridge) into
a perpetual night of West End,
Fringe and Dance theatre. During
the preceding months three red-hot
plays linked by the themes of anger
and injustice had taken a steady
attrition on my resolve to stay in and
stick to the vegie-vision.
Look Back in Anger, Osborne's
classic play, lured me into the
Theatre Museum Theatre in Covent
Garden. I was promised that
director Jim Dunk (who advertised
Molsen lager on the box and so was
an obvious connoisseur) had given
the play a great n e w re-
interpretation. The result put me off
'interpretations' a n d great
'adaptions' for life. I saw it as Jimmy
Porter betrayed. I'm still on the look
out for a better production but
couldn't afford the one day 'Friends
of the Earth' bash at the Coliseum
last Sunday.
Next it was Arthur Miller's turn
to stir up the bile with his version
of Ibsen's An Enemy of the People at
the Playhouse. Sure enough the
man has a persecution complex, but
who wouldn't have after a brush
with McCarthy? Kindled by the fires
of outrage I left in search of another
noble victim.
As luck would have it I found a
veritable martyr courtesy of
Tennessee Williams in his Orpheus
Descending, Jean Marc Barr as Val
Xavier and Vanessa Redgrave as
Lady Torrance set the Theatre Royal
Haymarket alight (almost literally)
as they stoked u p the fires i n
H i l l b i l l y H a d e s . W i t h Julie
Covington as Carol Cutrere the
evening went up in flames. It was
a baptism of fire for me as I
discovered the heat given off by
such a strong cast.
I think that it was shortly after this
that m y troubles became
compounded by the discovery of a
new and perhaps more potent vice.
D o w n and down I went into the
seventh circle of hell a n d the
Riverside Studios, Hammersmith.
Here the floppy hat brigade fester
in eternal damnation forced to listen
to each other's pretentious prattle.
That night they were out in force but
they d i d n ' t detract from the
stunning performance of Molissa
Fenley the N e w York contemporary
dancer. I was staggered by her
stamina and the vigour of her
visions as her naked torso twitched
to the strings through the whole of
Stravinsky's Rites of Spring. I made
my escape just in time to avoid a
particularly highbrow conversation:
The question being asked was
whether the nudity was in fact a
creatively integral part of the work,
or was Molissa gratuitously 'getting
them out 'cos that's just the crazy
kind of N e w York girl she is'? I
guess I'll never know.
It was time to take stock I decided:
To assess where I was going with all
this. So I calmed down and took
myself off to the Fringe. To the M a n
in the Moon, a pub venue where I
understood what was going on.
'Yes. of course I like the
feeling...of a full cunt.', yelled the
demonic diva. O h no, I was in for
a Berkoff battering. From My Point
of View only lasted an hour thank
G o d . During this time, despite the
numbing ranting, the chief effect
was to make me marvel at the skills
of two theatrical contortionists. Still,
it was a great venue.
Back at the bar I decided that I'd
opt for the admittedly absurd rather
Ayckbourn's Henceforward
