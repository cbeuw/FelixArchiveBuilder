News Review
Kenneth Baker visited IC and announced 'top up loans'.
Letting Scheme.
A squatter of a different sort came
to light i n November when it
emerged that because of a n
administrative error, a member of
staff had been living i n student
accommodation for three years. The
member of staff concerned, Carlos
FloreS refused to leave the flat when
the mistake w a s discovered,
c l a i m i n g that he h a d sitting
tennant's rights.
An expensive gamble
In September, the College spent
£2.9 million o n a student residence
in Earl's Court to house 40 students.
The rental for the residence, Olave
House, a former Girl Guides Hostel
was set well above the rental i n
other residences, at £55 per week.
A l t h o u g h this figure w a s
insufficient to pay off the interest on
the loan taken out by the College to
pay for the residence, the College
took the gamble that the loan capital
will continue to increase at a lower
rate than the rise i n value of the
property.
'People always accuse me of not
taking risks and now I'm taking
one' said College Secretary John
Smith.
Rent strikes at IC
Early October brought with it the
threat of rent strikes from the
residents of Fisher Hall i n Evelyn
Gardens w h o were complaining
that the Student Accommodation
Office had deliberately attempted to
mislead them over rent levels. A
meeting of ninety students voted to
pay rent only at the previous years
levels o n the ground that they had
not been told about rent increases
before moving in. Accommodation
Officer, Loretta O ' C a l l a g h a n
admitted that she had failed to
inform students of the new rent
levels.
A week later the threatened rent
strike was joined by residents of Beit
hall who were angry that they had
not been informed of the increased
rent levels - 12% greater than the
previous year - when they accepted
places. They were also unhappy
with the College's decision to charge
for an extra weeks rent over the
Christmas holidays.
Imperial College Union supported
the rent strike with a motion calling
for the College to use the income
generated b y taking o n more
students to subsidise
accommodation. The motion was
passed by a Union General meeting
in a n a m e n d e d f o r m w h i c h
threatened a College wide rent
strike should the governing body
refuse to transfer £1000 to the
residence account f o r every
additional overseas student taken
on.
Lexham ripoff
The power of the press can never
be u n d e r e s t i m a t e d . I n early
October, F E L I X investigated
allegations that the College was
unfairly charging students for
damage i n Lexham Gardens. The
unusually high damage charges,
which represented the accumulated
damage costs since the College
started renting the Lexham Gardens
houses, had been passed o n to
students after the College had been
forced to hand the property back to
its landlord. Halfway through
FELIX's investigation, the College
decided to reverse its decision to
charge students for damage they did
not cause saving itself considerable
embarrassment i n the process.
Ceiling collapse
Many of the residences have been
cursed this year with falling ceilings.
The first downfall hit Southwell
house i n October when a three by
four foot slab of % inch thick plaster
became dislodged. The room was
unoccupied at the time. There were
at least five more downfalls during
the remainder of the year, though
not all of the incidents made it to the
news pages of FELIX. Evelyn
Gardens Superintendent, Peter
Leeson, told FELIX that the College
was unable to afford to replace all
of the eighty year old lathe and
plaster ceilings but said that they
were checked every two years.
The College have now adopted a
policy of sweeping up fallen ceilings
as quickly as possible so that the
evidence can be binned before
FELIX photographers arrive on the
scene.
170 for sale
In N o v e m b e r the cost of
accommodation was becoming so
much of a problem that Imperial's
'QT Soc' decided to re-inflate the
residence account by putting the
Rector's House u p for sale. A n
advertisement was placed i n The
Standard and The Times offering
the residence for £5 million and 'for
sale' signs appeared i n front of the
property. Deputy President, Chas
Brereton, whose phone number was
given as the contact number said
that he h a d received some
interesting offers. Unfortunately,
the Rector was unavailable for
comment.
Top up loans
If there is one thing which has
caused students to sit u p and take
note more than anything else it is
the plans to introduce student loans
by 1990. The plans were first
mooted at by Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker during a low key
visit early i n the year when he took
part i n an informal discussion with
Imperial students. The plans were
a n n o u n c e d officially i n the
Commons in November, with a full
page of coverage i n the next day's
FELIX. Under the scheme , grants
will be frozen at their current levels
and students will be given an
interest free loan, but students will
not be entitled to claim housing or
unemployment benefits.
The proposal allows a student
living in London to borrow £460 per
year and £340 in the final year.
