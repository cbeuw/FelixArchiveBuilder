News Review
N E W S
FELIX takes a look at some of this year's news.
Bricks and mortar
Although many of the stories
covered by FELIX this year have had
their roots in the financial problems
which have beset the College i n
recent times, there has been no
reluctance o n behalf of both the
College and the Union to spend
large quantities of money o n
refurbishments.
The year began with the College's
decision to spend £1.4 million to
convert the Main House at Silwood
Park into a conference centre
complete with accommodation for
thirty businessmen, private dining
rooms, a swimming pool and a
squash court.
Snack Bar shocker
Next on the agenda was a £40,000
refit of the Union Snack Bar which
was given the go ahead following
losses of £35,000 the year before.
The new snack bar featured seating
for 100 people, a lowered ceiling and

the British Epilepsy Association.
a new lighting system. Vending
machines for confectionery a n d
drinks were installed, whilst the
existing furnishing (2 years old) was
moved into the Union Lounge
which was given a lighting tower,
a stage and a lick of paint.
Prophetic words were uttered at
the time by Deputy President, Chas
Brereton who said 'if we don't get
them in the first term, we lose them
forever.' Despite the expenditure
the snack bar did not prove as
popular as it had in previous years,
with high prices and small portions
putting off many students i n the
first week.
Later i n the first term FELIX
caused a n outrage b y
photographing a caterpillar found
by a student in a Snack Bar meal.
Despite accusations from the Union
President that the caterpillar had
been planted by FELIX, the Union
Catering Committee decided to
rename the outlet 'Caterpillar Cafe'
and purchased a painted sign to
announce the fact to the world.
In October, the snack bar was
making profits of £1500 a month,
but in December this had become a
loss of £2171. There was speculation
that stock had been stolen from the
store cupboard, but the losses were
generally attributed to a falling
clientele. The Union's response, to
reduce portion sizes further, was
heavily criticised by FELIX.
Refectory blues
Not to be outdone, the College
decided to refurbish its o w n
Sherfield refectory at a cost of
£300,000. N e w serveries were
introduced, new tables and chairs
were fitted and a pasta bar installed.
The refectories hit the headlines
again in December when a £22,000
deficit came to light. Refectory
Manager, Rob Northey was unable
to explain the loss which occurred
in the wake of a gross profit of
£73,000 in the previous year. The
Catering and Conference Services
Management Committee put the
losses down to increased salaries,
but when asked to comment on the
shortfall M r Northey's reply was 'I
know nothing I see nothing.'
FELIX Editor sued
M r Northey gained his retribution
after the Christmas issue of FELIX
when he threatened to sue the
FELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin, over a
'Norman the Ex-Union Rat' article
alleging that he had embezzled
£22,000 from the refectories to buy
a Porsche with sun roof and leather
upholstery. After taking legal advice
M r Goodwin agreed to raise £100 for
charity a n d print a retraction,
although M r Northey was kind
enough to drop his case subject to
FELIX printing nice things about
him for the rest of the year.
Cooking the books
The Union Bookshop also had its
own share of financial problems. A
trading deficit of £16,771 w a s
discovered in March which auditors
attributed to thefts by staff and
customers and underpayment of
suppliers by mistake. In April, after
the Easter break, the Bookshop
manager, Roy Hicks decided to take
early retirement and the Union
approved a complete refurbishment
of the shop. N e w cashing u p
procedures were introduced and the
go ahead given for an open plan
layout, an Electronic Point of Sales
system designed to monitor stock
levels and a tele-ordering system.
On the horizon...
More building plans lie o n the
horizon. The College has completed
plans for a £500,000 health suite for
the basement of Southside Hall of
Residence. If the plans are approved
by Union and College Committees
the health suite will provide a
multigym, weights facilities, a
solarium and saunas.
M e a n w h i l e £40,000 h a s been
earmarked by the Rector to pay for
a new public address system for the
Great Hall. A new lighting system,
sound proofing a n d improved
acoustics will be installed later,
subject to the Rector finding the
cash.
New Chemistry
Another project on the cards is the
construction of an extension to the
Chemistry building. Actually, the
project has been on the cards for
twenty years, but it has taken this
long for the University Grants
Commission to find the £3.6m
funding required. The news was not
universally welcomed amongst
academics i n the C h e m i s t r y
Department who were frustrated by
the small size of the building and its
lack of lecture theatres and fume
cupboards. The Department is now
having to negotiate with the Science
Museum for the retention of its
existing lecture theatres in the O l d
Chemistry building. Academics are
keen to point out, however, that the
old Chemistry building has not been
properly maintained during the
twenty years that it took to find the
funding for the new building and
that it is now in a condition which
can best be described as dilapidated.
Squatters trash Hamlet
Accommodation (or the lack of it)
has featured prominently i n the
news pages of FELIX.
Squatters were evicted from
student residences i n Hamlet
Gardens at the start of the year
following a court injunction. The
squatters h a d cause several
thousand pounds worth of damage
and had threatened Hamlet staff
w i t h p h y s i c a l violence. T h e
squatters through furniture out of
windows, left the flats covered with
abusive graffiti and contract cleaners
refused to clean one flat where
squatters had kept a dog and eleven
p u p p i e s locked i n s i d e . T h e
accommodation office gave students
a rent free week in an attempt to
ensure that the flats were not left
unoccupied after the Summer
May: Security Chief Geoff Reeves saved the day when he successfully defused
a hoax bomb.
