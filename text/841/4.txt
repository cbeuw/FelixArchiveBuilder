Silwood rents controlled
The College's Governors are to
consider a proposal o n Friday to
control rent increases at Silwood
Park. If the proposals go ahead, rent
increases in South Kensington may
be smaller in the future, according
to College Secretary, John Smith.
M r S m i t h ' s proposals were
anounced to students at Silwood
Park o n last M o n d a y . H e
recommends that the cost of a new
hall of residence at Silwood Park be
met by a £500,000 College loan over
25 years at a fixed rate of 9% interest
per annum. The idea has the
approval of students at Silwood
Park who objected to the College's
original proposal of a loan over 20
years at 12.5% per annum.
Silwood Park student Chairman,
Ian Lowles told FELIX that the
original plans would have meant
'quite a substantial rent increase.'
The new proposals, he says, will
allow for increases i n line with
surrounding Colleges. The plans, he
added, will mean that the College
is effectively subsidising the new
hall.
M r Smith pointed out that the
Law prevents the College from
directly funding residences. H e
added that his proposals could
mean that students would lose out
if interest rates were to fall i n the
future, although they presently
stood to gain.
The n e w hall will allow the
College to house undergraduate
"students on short courses separately
to permanent postgraduate
residents. It is hoped that the new
arrangement w i l l prevent
disturbances between the t w o
groups which have arisen i n the
past.
M r Smith's proposals include the
development of a Conference
Centre at Silwood Park. His original
proposals were rejected by the
Governors at a College Finance and
Executive meeting i n M a y due to
pressure from students over the
residence arrangements and fears
that the plans for the Conference
Centre could be financially unstable.
M r Smith n o w hopes that the
Silwood Science Park Company,
'Impact', will run the Conference
Centre.
'Impact' raises £200,000 per year
for the College. The n e w plans
recommend that this money be used
as a basis upon which to develop the
Conference Centre.
Although M r Smith feels that the
College may 'lose out a bit' initially,
he told FELIX that the Centre is ' A n
absolute winner.' He hopes to see
clubs, societies and departments
using the Centre at weekends as its
catering facilities improve.

Accommodation office
gets new dictionary
The College's A c c o m m o d a t i o n
Office has 'no sense of the word
urgency' when allocating students
for rooms over the S u m m e r
according to Lesley Rose i n the
College's Cash Office. Mrs Rose is
in charge of the billing of students,
who must p a y for S u m m e r
accommodation by the end of term.
Students are expected to receive
bills, notifying them of their place
this Summer by today. M r s Rose
told FELIX that many of the
students involved are postgraduates
who are required to give notice of
their departure from term time
accommodation. She is concerned
that many students will receive
notification of their place in hall with
too little notice.
College Accommodation Officer,
Loretto O'Callaghan told FELIX that
the staff i n the office had been
working hard for three weeks on the
allocations. The last batch was sent
to the Cash Office o n Monday.
Ms O'Callaghan is hoping that a
new computer based system will be
in place for next term's allocations,
which are presently done manually
with computer assistance.
