Washing accounts in public
Tom Yates argues for external bank accounts
Those of you who avidly read the
U G M reports, or (odder still) read
the Union Officers' Reports, may
have noticed that the Union has
decided it's i n favour of external
bank accounts f o r i n d i v i d u a l
societies. This may seem a small
thing, but judging by the hassle it
created i n its passing and the fuss
made by the Union throughout,
such an impression is mistaken.
Here I hope to familiarise people
with the existing system, and hence
to try to outline the advantages of
the proposed system. Getting it
passed by the Union was the easiest
stage in the birth of such a system.
Getting College to agree to it will be
very much harder, and I hope to
outline what I perceive to be the
reasons for this also.
Where do we stand now?
If y o u ' v e never been closely
involved with a club or society then
you probably don't realise h o w
much red tape a society has to live
with in order to get access to what
the Union concedes is 'its money',
being the money generated by the
society in the pursuit of its activities,
through ticket sales, membership,
fundraising events and more. Such
monies must be banked with the
Union, then to draw o n them the
societies must come once a week to
the U n i o n Office where the
appropriate H o n o r a r y Senior
Treasurer will pay out of the
respective Union account upon
presentation of receipts to his
satisfaction. Should the society wish
to buy anything, whether big or
small, a society member must pay
for it from his o w n pocket, then be
refunded at the convenience of the
Union. Certainly, it is possible to
use a Union Order Form (if you can
find an M S C Chairman to sign it),
but many firms will not handle pro
forma invoicing, especially for the
sums involved in the average society
transaction.
Where would we stand under the
new plan?
At the top of the year, the society
committee would meet and specify
to the treasurer what the money in
the external accont could and could
not be spent on. Then, as and when
the money needed to be spent o n
such things, the Treasurer a n d
Chairman would sign a cheque for
the amount, either to the creditor
direct, or to a society member who
would foot the bill but could get
repayment then and'there. Should
money need to be spent o n
something not already approved by
the committee, then they just meet
and authorise it, possibly as a class
of p a y m e n t ot be generally
approved i n future.
What's to stop fraud?
Primarily, the Executive of a society
are people w h o work for their
society, not for its downfall. Note
also that the account is overviewed
by the M S C that administers the
society, who retain the power to
freeze the account should anything
untoward occur. Nothing will stop
the really determined fraudster, but
nothing can stop h i m now either—
nor w i l l a n y b u t the most
ridiculously rigid system—so there's
no increase i n risk for a great
advance i n society freedom.
Sounds Good. What's the problem?
The core problem is it's never been
done before—here, and it should
come as no surprise to find the
powers that be at I C being
notoriously conservative. But it
works quite happily at many other
British universities, who are happy
to treat societies as collections of
students p u r s u i n g a c o m m o n
interest, rather than as a multiplicity
of small businesses. College will
probably oppose this on exactly the
same grounds—that it doesn't fit in
with established business practice,
not auditing, etc. etc.—but these are
falacious grounds. Societies aren't
like little versions of NatWest Bank,
they're just too small to apply these
methods to. Ask an accountant to
audit an account with an annual
turnover of £400 and he'll laugh at
you—all the way to the bank. If
other objections exist, then it'll be
interesting to hear them. But none
have come u p i n the past eight
months (this has been brewing for
a while now!) and I suspect none
will.
What if College won't play ball?
If the only reasons against this are
the not-good-business-practice type,
and it's going to founder o n that,
then it may be worth considering
disobedience. The Union already
has the power to grant external bank
accounts of any unregulated type if
they choose to do so, and are merely
advised not to do it without good
cause, so there's some precedent for
this already. Some have said that in
the end, College have the final say.
But this is not really true. It seems
unlikely that the Union would hit
anything bigger than choppy water
through pursuing this to the end,
and if you, the electorate, find the
arguments of College
unsatisfactory, the Union can be
instructed to proceed with the
scheme regardless. This is
inflammatory, of course, a n d a
negotiated solution would be highly
desirable, but I urge you not to let
this action be stopped by irrelevant
objections.
Chas' rebuttal
Finally
O h good, the end. I'm not a great
one for arguing in public, and this
only ever came out because it had
to, so I'm not going to waste space
and time pursuing any half-baked
arguments through the pages of
FELIX. There's quite a lot more
bumph about this than appears
here, and if you really want to argue
about it, or feel you've a valid point
to make, at least come and get the
small print from me first, I live i n
room 6M69 Huxley and a m o n
x6776. A n y letters i n the weeks to
come that aren't written on a full
deck are going to be ignored!
Those of you who l i e the idea,
please don't let it die.
Tom Yates
When we went up to the Union Office to ask Chas where his reply to this
article was, he denied all knowledge of it. So, we picked u p the nearest
thing we could find to fill the space. This may paint a clearer picture of
the Deputy President's job function
