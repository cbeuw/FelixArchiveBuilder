Interview
'There is nothing
sacrosanct'
What is it like to be an. journalist investigating news stories like the
government's abuse of the Data Protection Act or the race for the discovery
of the AIDS virus. Steve Connor is a science reporter on the Daily
Telegraph, has worked on Computing Magazine and New Scientist and
has written books on both of thesfe subjects. Liz Warren went to the
Telegraph building to interview hitn.
How did you get involved in
journalism?
When I left university, I got on to
a graduate training scheme run by
H a y m a r k e t P u b l i s h i n g . This
involved both theory and practice
working on different magazines. I
then worked on the technical press
published by Haymarket which was
later sold to a Dutch publishing
house called V N U . After three years
there I joined N e w Scientist for six
years and then moved to the
Telegraph.
What was it that attracted you to
journalism?
I did a Zoology degree which is an
unusual science because it's more
literate than mathematical. I've
always enjoyed the writing part of
science but not the laboratory work.
When I left University thinking
what the hell to do, I felt that rather
than do something boring that
makes a lot of money, I'd do
something which is a bit more risky
and exciting.
What do you think makes a 'good'
news story?
That's very difficult. From the
cynical viewpoint, a good news
story's one that you can sell to your
news desk but very often some of
the best news stories don't get
passed to the news desk.
Where do good stories initially
come from?
From absolutely anywhere. There's
no set formula. Stories can come
from talking to people, from reading
scientific literature or other
newspapers or press releases. Y o u
. can't control news. It happens and
there are angles to which specialists
such as myself can take. If a plane
falls out of the sky then the general
reporters will be on to it in terms of
how many dead, whereas I'll be
looking at it from the angle of what
went wrong.
How do you actually set about
researching a news story once
you've got that initial information
about it?
By far the best tool every journalist
has is a telephone. You call whoever
you think has the information which
you want. If I had to put a ratio on
it I think 80 % of my work is on the
telephone and 20% is reading.
How do you build up contacts in
the areas that you're interested in?
You just do build u p contacts.
Because you speak to a lot of people
you come across people who can
give information a n d are very
knowledgeable about their subject.
It happens in a natural way. You
don't have to ply them with drinks
or take them for meals, athough
sometimes that helps. Sometimes
it's difficult to get information but
I'm always surprised at how people
will help the press.
What would you say is the biggest
story you've ever worked on?
The biggest story I first came across
would be a story which I wrote with
D u n c a n C a m p b e l l about the
discovery of the MI5 computer in
May fair. That was a very big story
for me then because it got picked up
by all the nationals and on radio.
The impact of that was that I
suddenly realised that I could affect
the news by what I wrote. More
recently, the feature for N e w
Scientist about the discovery of the
AIDS virus and the row between the
French and American scientists over
who discovered it and who had
proprietorial rights.
Have you ever been warned off a
story while you've been researching
it?
A l l the time. It varies from people
who say,'don't write anything yet,
because it's going to be a much
bigger story'. Generally you are
talking to people who are naive of
the way the news gathering process
works. They don't understand that
if there's something in the public
domain there's nothing to stop
people writing about it. But that's
very mild, that's just naivety. A t
times y o u do get threats of legal
action warning you off publication
which you should take seriously but
you shouldn't let them unduly
influence the way you go about
doing things. Every story demands
accuracy and that you speak to all
sides on controversial issues. I've
also had verbal threats, but nothing
very serious
So you've never had any physical
threats?
Not really, no. There are journalists
who can have a gun put to their
head or whatever. I've never been
in that position, because I've never
really covered that sort of story but
events i n China really do highlight
the sort of threats that journalists
can come across.
W o u l d y o u protect the
confidentiality of your sources even
if it meant breaking the law, for
example b y h o l d i n g back
documents?
Well as I understand it journalists
can protect their sources without
breaking the law. The short answer
to that is that the two are not
necessarily incompatible. I would
protect the confidentiality of m y
sources and I have to, but I don't
think, at the moment anyway, the
system in this country is such that
you have to break the law. But you
have to guard against that situation
arising.
Would you feel it justified to break
the law to get information for a
story, by for example breaking and
entering?
No. It is not worth committing a
crime to get information. There is no
need for it. The official secrets act,
which is no longer i n force, was
quite a blunderbuss in its approach.
By encouraging civil servants to give
y o u i n f o r m a t i o n y o u were
technically in breach of it, but that's
no longer the case. The new bill
going through Parliament is much
more sinister in the sense that by
simply writing about things which
the government deems secret you
will be technically in breach of the
law.
When you have a government
which is putting stringent controls
on the press you've got to decide
whether it's in the public interest to
publish something while at the
same time running the risk of
prosecution. If there is something
which you really do feel is in the
public interest a n d y o u ' v e
convinced your editors and they
and the publishing company are
willing to run the risk, then of
course I w o u l d p u b l i s h . B u t
ultimately it's the publishers and the
editors who will make that decision.
How justified do you think the
government is in using legislation
to stop the publishing of
'embarrassing' material?
There is a need to protect secrets
which need to be kept for national
security. The problem is national
security has never been defined. It's
used as a blanket term to cover
a n y t h i n g w h i c h c o u l d be
embarrassing to the government. I
think the term really does have to
be hammered out and defined
clearly. Anything which is part of
national security then obviously has
to have classification. I do believe
