Flicks
With the exams finally over, at least
for most of us, there's plenty of time
to nip off to the cinema and at least
a handful of recent releases to see.
You'll no doubt prefer to call into
Southside or the Hoop and Toy for
a day or so first, but when you've
puked all you can, here's something
to do.
First up is Fletch Lives, previewed
recently in FELIX, a sequel to the
1985 film Fletch. Chevy Chase takes
the title role, a resourceful eccentric,
plagued by his wife's alimony
demands. The inheritance of his
aunt's L o u i s i a n a plantation
provides a way out for Fletch, a
murder mystery, and as Cilia would
say, a lotta laughs.
Chas swans through all this,
digging up clues from behind the
various disguises he sports and
wearing an amiable grin at all times.
Small effort is required to rekindle
his past roles in the same type of
self-parody which accompanies
such actors as John Cleese. A n
ecologically sound script w i t h
Video
Coincidental to other big screen
releases listed here, two of the major
videos issued this month star
Timothy Dalton and Chevy Chase.
Hawks has Dalton cast as a British
Lawyer, Bancroft, w h o meets
Anthony Edwards, a terminally ill
American football player, while they
share a ward in hospital.
They need a diversion to make
their lives bearable, and what better
adventure than stealing a n
ambulance and making a dash for
the brothels of Amsterdam. The
combination of serious backdrop
and humourous plot pigeon-hole
this movie squarely in the realms of
the black comedy.
Funny Farm is another ideal
platform for Chevy Chase, just like
all his other films. The inimitable
blend of satire and farce is this time
set against the old plot device,
writer's block.
In escaping the city, Chase and his
wife, Madolyn Smith, discover an
idyllic Utopia, full of folksy charm in
the mountain village of Redbud. But
Redbud has more eccentrics than
even N e w York.
Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, but
the script is written by Jeffrey Boam,
author of Innerspace and The Lost
Boys, so it is almost certain to be
good. A strong support cast and the
benign charm of the lead indicate an
essential rental.
Andrew Clarke.
sufficient humour makes this a
recommendable film. Highlight is a
set-piece dream sequence, a satirical
version of Disney's Song of the
South, complete w i t h cast of
thousands and cavorting animated
dog.
Dreams of another kind are the
basis for the fourth Nightmare on Elm
Street, entitled The Dream Master. A
hound from hell urinates fire on
Freddy Krueger's grave and this
results in another resurection for old
pizza face. His first move of course
is to wipe out all the kids i n a
multitude of inventively gory ways.
The heroine is Alison, a credible
performance by newcomer Lisa
Wilcox, who proves to be a mixture
of Bruce Lee and Jane Fonda. Robert
England is once again excellent as
Freddy; the sharpness of his wit
matched only by his clawed glove.
The £3 million budget allows some
impressive effects to spice up what
would otherwise be a predictably
drab affair. N o doubt the most easily
anticipated scene though is the final
hook from which Nightmare 5 can be
hung.
Also doing the rounds at the
moment is Cocoon: The Return. A
more conventional sequel in that it
falls way short of its predecessor.
Not that the original was in any way
spectacular. There are at least as
many sub-plots as characters and
yet for all that it lacks a principal
storyline, leaving the impression
that none of the characters really
does anything.
Steve Guttenberg repeats the
alien intercourse of the original
minutes of epic cinema, 20 of which
are previously unseen. Gloriously
colourful a n d magnificently
perceptive, D a v i d Lean's
masterpiece is a benchmark for all
other big budget movies. Star of the
show, Peter O'Toole, launched his
career here, and went on to make
such classics as Caligula and High
Spirits. The film is showing at the
O d e o n , M a r b l e A r c h , a n d
absolutely nowhere else.
S h o w i n g n o w h e r e , b u t the
Curzon, West End is Paris by Night.
Few releases have better timing than
this one—it's about Euro M P s and
some of the things they d o .
Charlotte Rampling is the M E P in
question, and aside from blackmail,
murder and a steamy affair, she has
an alcoholic hubby to cope with.
Michael Gambon is wasted in this
role.
The criticism of Thatcherite
morality may be a salient topic, but
it cannot rescue an otherwise dreary
thriller, which is anything but
thrilling. It should be said that
Rampling is able to maintain her
career motif of sexual entanglement,
and a consistency of performance on
that level cannot be wholly ignored.
Elsewhere, an unchanging style is
present in Tom Holland's new film
Child's Play. A l l of H o l l a n d ' s
previous films have been a remake
of the boy who cried wolf tale. Here
the narrative has reached its absurd
limit, as the ' w o l f turns out to be
a child's freckle faced doll called
Chucky, recently possessed by the
spirit of a dead voodoo murderer.
You believe me, don't you?
Well, Hello Dolly.
Cocoon, and his partner Tahnee
Welch shows that she got the part
more through her mother's name
than her acting ability. This is one
to see when you've seen everything
else, and puked some more i n
Southside.
At the other end of the spectrum
is the newly restored Lawrence of
Arabia. The obsessive work of two
enthusiasts has resulted i n 216
The predictability and repetition
involved are overcome by some
good effects, most specifically the
puppet, Chucky, in nine different
forms and worked by an army of
puppeteers. The result is a modest
horror flick with just enough blood
to make you chucky uppy, even
when Southside affects you no
more.
