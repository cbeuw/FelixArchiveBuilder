Interview
there should be more freedom of
information in this country. It's the
most secretive society in the
Western hemisphere. I don't think
the replacement of the official
secrets act is going to make it any
better.
You obviously think Britain is too
secretive. Where do y o u think
Britain i s heading i n terms of
personal privacy?
Personal privacy is always
something you can buy, I feel. I hate
the idea of personalised junk mail
coming through my letterbox. Some
people deem their letter box to be
a private thing. I also get annoyed
at people ringing me up trying to
sell me things on the telephone.
These are very mild forms of
invasions of privacy, they're just
annoyances. But there are more
sinister forms of invasion of privacy,
stemming right up to the trawling
of files by agents of the state in order
to protect this thing called national
security. I'm sure it goes on, in the
BBC for example where people have
been refused jobs on the grounds
that they have something in their
past which was detrimental to the
government or to society at large. I
think it's a very sinister
development in society. It's very
difficult to define: what is privacy?
A r e there a n y subjects y o u
wouldn't research into for political,
moral or religious reasons?
I would say as a general rule no. In
terms of specifics, I've got absolutely
no interest in a football manager's
sex life or the private affairs of some
person. I just don't want to do that
sort of story. I don't particularly
want to read about it either. Apart
from that sort of area though there
is nothing sacrosanct.
D o y o u f i n d that j o u r n a l i s m
intrudes on your private life?
I think increasingly so. It's very
difficult to divorce your private life
from your professional life because
news isn't a nine to five job.
Something might happen at twelve
o'clock at night and you're rung up
and expected to find the story. It
especially happens working on a
daily national, but I don't think it
unduly affects my private life. I still
enjoy my private life.
W h e n you're writing do you prefer
w o r k i n g o n y o u r o w n o r
collaborating with other people?
I prefer writing on my own because
you can't write by committee. I have
worked with other people and I
don't find it that difficult providing
you have a professional agreement
with the other person. In terms of
writing, I always write on my own
because I cannot write one
paragraph then the other person
writes the next paragraph. You can
write something and then the other
person can add to it and you can see
what they've done, but it's twice as
much work, not half as much.
That's why I prefer doing it on my
own.
H o w long has it taken you to write
and research your books?
The first book took a long time, I
think it was about three years. The
AIDS book took a very short time.
It took about three months. The
reason for that was that Penguin
wanted a book on AIDS, they
wanted it quickly and we had the
information to hand, more or less
researched already. For the second
edition which has just come out, we
were given a bit more time. I think
it's improved because of that.
D i d you concentrate just on writing
the book or did you do it i n your
spare time from your job?
I had to do it in my spare time,
around my job, which was very
difficult. I'm not sure whether I will
undertake the task again, not in the
forseeable future because it's very
time consuming and all your
holidays and evenings and
weekends are taken up. It's very
exhausting as well.
Would you want to work freelance,
maybe to give you the chance to
write another book?
Not at the moment, no. I've never
worked freelance for long periods of
time, just odd months here and
there. Maybe at some point in the
future I will think about it, but for
the moment I have no plans. I prefer
the security of working full time for
an organisation.
O n the Record w a s obviously
incredibly well researched. Do you
think it w a s rather offputting
including that much technical detail
i n it?
With hindsight I do feel it was a very
solid piece of research. I sometimes
wonder how easy it was to read and
how many people were that keen on
wading through that amount of
material. For me it was a bit of an
experiment because it was my first
large project. Because Duncan
Campbell with whom I wrote it had
already done several books, he more
or less took the lead in it. To a great
extent it was his book rather than
mine. I don't think I would do it the
same way again if I had the chance.
I would want to make it a bit lighter
and easier to read. I think it was a
bit solid.
Who have been your role models?
I don't think I have any really. There
are investigative journalists whom
I admire, David Leigh on the
Observer who's done incredibly
good stories. But there are a lot of
good reporters on Heet Street. Andy
Veitch, for example, the Guardian
medical correspondent is very good.
Often on New Scientist I would be
covering stories which he had
covered and he would leave very
few angles for me to do for a weekly
magazine. So he is a good reporter.
I don't really have role models. I
think role models are quite
dangerous.
What do you feel should be the
image of science that national
dailies should present?
Talking of role models, look at the
New York Times and Washington
Post: they cover science exceedingly
well. They have no embarrasment
whatsoever about putting an
important but technically difficult
story on the front page.
Newspapers in this country tend to
shy away from science and
technology. It's changing, but it's a
constant battle to convince news
editors that science is important
because I think they feel, and maybe
the general public feels, that science
isn't important, that it's too esoteric
and not entertaining enough.
Do you think the public's
perception, as fuelled by
newspapers, is that scientists are all
little men in white coats?
There is this element that either they
are mad or they are evil. The 1950's
science fiction approach to scientists
is finally being buried. But if you
mention a scientist to most people
their eyes glaze over. It's an uphill
struggle. All we can do is keep
writing the stories and throwing
them at the news desk and hoping
that they get in.
What do you think the public's
perception of journalists is?
Probably not very high: grubby men
in grubby coats. Most people read
the tabloids and they have a lot to
answer for. But working on the
Telegraph I can't really see many
grubby people around.
A threat from within
'On the Record' describes how the
introduction of the plastic National Insurance
Numbercard could lead to its use as a national
identity card. It could then form the skeleton
of a national registration system which could
severely curtail personal freedom. After
experiencing some problems over the security
of providing Union cards, Imperial College
Union consulted the College on the possibilty
of merging computerised library cards with
Union cards. This scheme has been shelved
because of administrative difficulties.
A global College-wide registration system
such as this would have allowed the linking
of information on courses, examination
results, personal tutors' reports, non-payment
of hall and course fees and, perhaps most
disturbing of all, could have led to monitoring
social activities and political affiliations
through offering computerised mailing lists
to clubs' members on providing members
Union Card numbers.
