Money for nothing,
giro cheques for free
Once the exams are over most
undergraduates will be turning to
what they will be doing during the
summer vacation. The sort of
questions they might ask are:
-Will I be able to get a job?
-Should I stay i n London or go
home
-If I don't work can I claim any
Benefit?
-Can I claim Housing Benefit if I'm
working?
The aim of this article is to look at
the different options available and
what they involve.
'Summer i n the city' or at home?
Some students only rent their
a c c o m m o d a t i o n d u r i n g the
academic year and tend to return to
stay with their parents over the
Summer. Others will be keeping on
their accommodation i n order to
continue living there into the next
academic year. If you will be leaving
your current address at the end of
term a n d are undecided about
where to spend the summer you
should ask yourself the following
questions:
• D o I want to spend the whole
summer with my family?
• Can I get a job easily if I go home?
• H o w much more will I be able to
save if I go home?
• H o w much can I earn if I stay i n
London or if I went to another
town?
• H o w much will I be able to save
if I stayed i n London or went
elsewhere after allowing for living
and accommodation expenses?
There are some obvious financial
advantages to spending the summer
at home, however temporary jobs in
London tend to be better paid so
you might end up saving more by
staying London or by going to
another area where there is better
paid employment.
Claiming Housing Benefit over the
Summer
Anyone claiming Housing Benefit at
present will know that their claim
will be closed at the end of the
summer term. This is because the
assessment of a student claim only
applies to the 'period of study'.
Once the Summer term finishes
most students will have completed
their studies for the year and are no
longer in receipt of 'student income'
(usually an L E A grant) and in order
to continue to receive Housing
Benefit a new claim will have to be
made based o n the student's
circumstances over the summer.
There are three situations i n
which a student might claim H B
over the summer:
1. If you are working and paying
rent then you can claim H B based
on your earnings. This option is
equally open to those i n College
owned accommodation who cannot
claim H B during the period of
study. This is because the rules
regarding this type of
accommodation do not apply during
the summer vacation. A n y o n e
applying for H B when working
must bear in mind that they are only
likely to qualify if earnings are quite
low, see box 1:
Student aged 18-24, paying rent of £50.1
Maximum amount of net earnings before HB entitlement
ceases
Housing Benefit payable on rent £50 and earnings of £99
Student aged 18-24, paying rent of £60.00 pw
Maximum amount of net earnings
HB Payable
Student aged 25+, rent £50
Maximum amount net earnings
HB payable
Student aged 25*, rent £60
Maximum amount net earnings
HB payable

After getting your benefit, this will seem easy.
Obviously the less you earn the
higher your Housing Benefit will be.
So if you are working and your
earnings are within the above levels
or your rent is higher than £60.00
pw it is worth making a claim. It is
also worth claiming if you are doing
agency work where your earnings
fluctuate or you have weeks without
work. The Housing Benefit Dept can
assess your claim based on average
earnings. If you are going to claim
this should be done as soon as you
start work. You can get a claim form
from the Housing Benefit Office for
your area or if you are in London
from the Welfare Office.
2. If you are absent from your
accommodation at any time over the
summer eg to go on holiday you
may be able to claim H B while you
are away. So that someone who has
been working and does not qualify
for H B could be entitled for the
period he/she is away. Entitlement
in this situation will depend o n
whether or not your main reason for
occupying your accommodation is
for the purpose of studying. DSS
advise that attendance on the course
shall not normally be regarded as
the main purpose of occupying the
home if a student:
• Lived i n the accommodation
before the beginning of the course;
or
• has a child or young person living
with h i m or her; or
• is aged 25 or over and has no other
accommodation; or
•is under 25 and has no parent or
g u a r d i a n a n d n o other
accommodation.
If you are not sure whether this rule
affects you or not you should seek
advice. If you decide to make a cliam
for the period you are away you
must do so before you go. If you
will have no income during the
period you are away it is quite i n
order to state on your claim from
that your income is ' N I L ' .
3. If you are unable to get a job in
time for the start of the vacation it
is likely you will be signing on as
u n e m p l o y e d a n d c l a i m i n g
U n e m p l o y m e n t Benefit and/or
Income Support. If you are paying
rent you will also be able to get H B .
In the section o n Unemployment
Benefit and Income Support I will
explain how H B is claimed in this
situation.
