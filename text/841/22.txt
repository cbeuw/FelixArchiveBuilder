You have been traipsing between committee
meetings for the best part of the last six
months. You are now sitting in the Union Bar
with ten empty pint glasses in front of you. You
have become a hack. You are a dismal excuse
for a human being and no longer worthy of
continuing this game. You have definitely lost.
End of Game
26
After a brief rush of adrenalin, your panic
subsides and you decide to approach the
situation like a mature sensible adult. You go
to the HUB Office to explain that there has been
a mistake and that you only wanted a light bulb
changed. Go to 16.
no
The Deputy President suddenly sees the merits
of your argument and reverses the 'interesting'
decision of House Committee. Go to 42.
30
You are on a long and difficult journey. Do you
choose to buy a new bulb from Southside Shop
Igo to 29), do you ask at the Union Office (go
to 15), or do you risk a visit to Sherfield (gi
to 24)?
32
The Rector's Wife offers a reward of £1 million
for the person who can deliver you dead or very
dead to her office. Your bodyguards are only
too happy to oblige her. Your are very very
dead, your epitaph reads 'Nobody crosses HUB
and lives'.
That's all folks.
35
Miracles will never cease. The
LHSTTFLBRFSSSC has agreed to provide you
with a light bulb. Will you ask the Union to
replace it (go to 5) or risk doing it yourself (go
to 31)?
23
'Industrial society!' cries the sherry lover.
Suddenly the door to the President's office
crashes opens. There's a slithering sound and
the President crawls out leaving a trail of slime
behind him. He starts to lick your boots.
'Issss tnere anything we can do for you, oh
massster?' he smarms.
You explain about the light bulb.
'Oh Goodnessss, how disssasterous. It will
be fixed immediately, with the utmost haste.'
The Union Office jumps into action. Two
hacks asleep in the corner are kicked awake.
The whole office grovels its way up to the
committee room and the president personally
supervises I

You have just done a very stupid thing. The
light was still on when you tried to replace the
bulb. You have electrocuted yourself, blown
every fuse in college, and broken the brand
new bulb, You are dead. This is a terminal
condition. Very few people-have recovered
from death and you are not going to be one of
them.
Subsequently, you are elected as chairman
of three major sub-committees and go on to
become Union President. Your presidency is
acclaimed as being the most efficient,
successful and enlightened in Union history.
Unfortunately, the light bulb still hasn't been
fixed. You have, therefore, lost the game.

You are now in the cpllege t

n
e
l system. As
you are reading the graffiti (some students are
so wacky aren't they?) you notice a small dark
dank tunnel leading away at floor level. You can
continue down the main tunnel (go to 44), or
crawl down the dark tunnel to 61,

You can go to the Union Office (go to 15) or
attend a tutorial (go to 2)
You poke your head around the door of the
Presidential Office. He's sitting with his feet up
on the desk, reading a copy of the 'Sun' and
drinking tea from a musical mug. He turns to
you and bawls, 'Get lost! Can't you see I'm in
a meeting!'. You leave and return to 7.

The Sherfield bureaucrat with special
responsibility for light bulbs tells you that
replacement bulbs are available if you fill in form
R27b. This requires the signatures of the
Rector, College Secretary, Accommodation
Adviser, Safety Officer, Security Officer,
Finance Officer and Lassie, the Sherfield
Building official pet cat.
Toss a coin seven times. If you get seven
heads go to 10, otherwise go to 45.
25
You feel hungry, and decide to get something
to eat. Do you go to the Caterpillar Cafri (go to
40) or to Belushi's (go to 17)
29
You show the bulb to the shop assistant who
replies: 'Mi abuelo era un banane'. You take out
your phrase book and deduce that she had
peculiar parentage.
'I no speako Spanish' you say enunciating
very slowly and, grabbing a packet of
cornflakes from a nearby shelf, you pretend to
be a light bulb.
The assistant responds by gesticulating
wildly, moaning and contorting her body into
various different positions, at least three of
which are biologically impossible.
However, after two years of studying 'Give Us
A Clue,' you are by now an expert at Charades
and deduce that Imperial College Union only
buys bulbs with left handed screw threads and
that, needless to say, Southside shop only
stocks bulbs with right-handed threads. You
give up and go back to 30.
33
You wait for three months for the next House
Committee meeting. Your light bulb is item
213b(ii)onthe agenda. Before the meeting you
go for a fortifying drink in the Union Bar. You
see various members of House Committee
swigging spirits from pewter tankards and
discussing the previous month's Union General
Meeting. Do you buy them drinks (go to 191 or
sit in a corner and hope they won't notice you
(go to 49)?
38
The Editor accidently loses your article. Do you
complain (go to 50) or just resubmit it (go to
55)?
39
Two hours later you arrive home feeling
excessively happy and more than a little drunk:
once again there is light in the committee room!
On the floor of your room is an envelope
addressed to you. Go to 57
