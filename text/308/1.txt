At today's Union meeting a motion of no-confidence
in the Hon. Secretary, D. Hobman is going to be put
before you. The events leading up to this typify the
worst possible breakdown in communications between
Union officials.
It all started last term
when Dave Hobman, in
line with Union policy,
went to see a flat in Cam-
bridge Gardens (South
Kensington) with a view to
using it for student accom-
modation as are the
Ravenscourt flats at the
moment.
After a preliminary sur-
vey it was decided to buy
it although it needed a lot
of work done, including
two new toilets. The
builders contracted for the
job said that it would
be ready in time for the
Spring Term. It would then
be able to house seven
people.
The flat was advertised
on the Union notice board
at the beginning of term
and he told everyone
whom he thought might be
interested. Very little re-
sponse was forthcoming
and so when his girlfriend
and two of her friends
expressed interest, he
offered them 3 of the 7
available places. At the
time they were in inter-
collegiate halls of resi-
dence at University Col-
lege and not liking it.
However, on going to look
at the flat they found it had
not been finished and
since they had given
notice to leave their halls,
the net result was nowhere
to go.
Dave then managed to
get the College to put
them up for a week or two
while the redecorating
was finished. At this time,
he had to go to France for
a conference lasting a
week during which time
John McCullough adver-
tised the remaining places
in IC News. Up till now
only one more person has
said he might want to live
at the flat and so three
places are still vacant.
On Monday of last week
he spoke to Brian Darling
about this and got the im-
pression that everything
had been made clear.
However, this was not the
case. Soon after this he
was presented with an
ultimatum by Brian Dar-
ling, Paul Jowett and Dave
Amos which said 'We can
withdraw it if you like. If
you resign!' The 'it' being
referred to is a very vio-
lently worded motion
which would have been
totally unjustified even if its
supposed basis was true.
'I.C.U. recognises that
the processes of alloca-
tion of the three places in
the Cambridge Gardens
flat, before advertisement,
leaves the Hon. Sec. open
to allegations of corruption
of the gravest nature. Such
alleged abuses of a posi-
tion should be exposed
firstly, and if proven, the
requisite action taken. In
this particular case this
demands the resignation
of the Hon. Sec. and the
removal of the persons
from the flat, who gained
their occupancy by gross
corruption.'
It apparently took Dave
Hobman two days before
he could find anyone to
talk to about the issue and
tales that he and Dave
Amos would not be seen
in the same office together
are probably to be believ-
ed. After he finally got
through to Dave Amos, the
latter agreed that the pro-
ceedings were unjustified
and said he would try to
prevent the motion being
put to the meeting.
What seems incompre-
hensible to me is the fact
that three apparently re-
sponsible members of the
I.C.U. council should actu-
ally get this far without
asking the 'accused' what
he had to say about it.
It highlights the worst
aspects of Union 'petty
mindedness' just at a time
when people are wonder-
ing what we have a Union
for anyway. If we must
have a group of people
which supposedly repre-
sents us then the least we
can expect is that they be-
have responsibly.
Cheshire
C h a t
On Thursday of last
week, Group Captain Leon-
ard Cheshire spoke to an
Associated Studies group
on the subject of suffering.
Leonard Cheshire serv-
ed in the R A F during
World War II and at the age
of 28 was the official Bri-
tish observer at the drop-
ping of the atom bomb at
Nagasaki. He retired from
the RAF the following year,
since when he has been
engaged in the setting up
and running of homes for
the adult disabled. There
are now about 100 Che-
shire homes both in the
UK and abroad.
The speaker commented
on the role of those who
suffer and that however
we help such people, their
dignity, freedom and indi-
viduality must always be
respected. He remarked
that some people suffering
chronic physical disability
were, under the NHS,
doomed to an existence in
the geriatric wards of our
hospitals. However, those
and all who must suffer
still have the same basic
hopes and desires for life
and resent their loss of
independence and still
need to mix in society.
Group Captain Cheshire
went on to say that in
helping others, we often
give materially, but in re-
turn we receive spiritually
through the example of
those who must endure
suffering. They have real-
ized that they must accept
their situation and come to
terms with it.
The point was made that
it was the individual who
was all important and
could and would change
the world by doing what
was within his power to
make the world a little bet-
ter for someone else.
When questioned about
Nagasaki, he considered
the circumstances, if any
in which the use of force
is justified. He said that
there was sometimes no
option. His conditions were
that there must be no
alternatives, that the mini-
mum of forces should be
employed and that the
ultimate good of all man-
kind should be at the
heart of its use. In 1945, to
end the war the alterna-
tives were the invasion of
Japan by the Allied forces
in which at least 3 million
lives would have been lost
or the use of an atomic
bomb. The speaker sup-
ported the second choice
but regretted that it had
killed so many when it
could have been dropped
in the country or the sea
as a warning. The present
build up of nuclear wea-
pons despite its obvious
undesireability did how-
ever bring about a certain
surge of responsibility in
those who held them.
