The Student Counselling Ser-
vice has appeared to fill a gap
in the College system of stud-
ent health and welfare.
Originally, problems which
the personal tutor considered
too complex for them to handle
were referred to the Health Cen-
tre for treatment by a qualified
psychiatrist. However, a great
many of the cases involved were
not serious enough to need pro-
per psychiatric aid and so valu-
able time was being wasted.
In about 1969 this deficiency
in the system was recogised but
it still took eighteen months and
growing concern by the student
body of the Medical Services
Committee before this was
remedied with the introduction
of a Student Counsellor. Origin-
ally, provision was made for this
post to be part-time although it
was seen that the possibility of
the job becoming full-time
should be taken into account.
With these aims in mind Mrs.
Bonny Hartnett was asked to
set up the service in January
1971, working at IC for three
days a week. She graduated
from Melbourne University in
1966 with a B.A. and Diploma of
Social Studies. After a year as
a social worker in Australia she
decided to go abroad, first to
Italy, where six months were
spent teaching English. Eventu-
ally after a year or so of living
on the continent she moved to
England and then back to Aus-
tralia. It was while working as
a student counsellor there that
she got married and subse-
quently returned to England so
that her husband could do post-
graduate work. This raised back-
ground makes her ideally suited
for a job which requires great
understanding and the ability to
communicate easily with stud-
ents needing help.
The service is there quite
simply to help with any prob-
lems a student may have, i.e.
with personal problems (rela-
tionships with families, sexual
problems, anxiety, depression,
etc.), and more academic mat-
ters such as fear of failure, loss
of motivation, anxiety about
exams and work.
Mrs Bonny
Hartnett
Each appointment is normally
one hour long and on average
a case might take about seven
or eight weeks with one session
per week. It is taken for granted
that all these are strictly confi-
dential and so anyone who
might be worried about inform-
ation leaking back to their de-
partment need not be con-
cerned. In fact this system pro-
vides the security which might
be felt lacking in a personal
tutor who may have to mark
examination papers. Although
he is unlikely to deliberately dis-
tort the results the possibility is
always there.
An analysis of the number of
people using the service shows
that about 40 per cent are self-
referred. This is increasing as
more and more people hear of
its existence. The first year saw
about 120 people either being
referred or coming themselves
for help and it will soon be nec-
essary for the job to become
full-time if justice is to be done
to the individual cases.
Discussion groups are organ-
ised in the different departments
at which personal tutors ask for
help in dealing with difficult
cases. These are a compara-
tively new features and appear
to be successful. A weekly meet-
ing of senior tutors, Mrs. Hart-
nett and Dr. Agnes Wilkinson, a
psycotherapist from L.S.E., dis-
cusses more general problems
and ways of solving them. It is
hoped that these will increase
the number of students referred
before it is too late for anything
to be done. Quite often, the
referred only comes when the
decision to withdraw someone
from a course has been taken.
Hence all that can be done is to
prepare the person for leaving
the University. This is clearly
unsatisfactory.
Plans for the future include
an active involvement in the
Union's student advisory service
which is currently being con-
sidered. There is also the possi-
bility that independence from
the Health department could
occur, this is unlikely at the
present.
For anyone who feels they
might like to talk over anything
that is worrying them, even if
they don't really know what it is
themselves, Mrs. Hartnett is
available from 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fri-
days. It is best to make an
appointment but 2.30 - 3.30 p.m.
each day is set aside for any-
one to come without a previous
arrangement.
RCSA Careers
Brains Trust 72
The R C S A held a
Careers Brains Trust meet-
ing in South Side Senior
Common Room on Thurs-
day, 20th January. About
165 people were present,
the vast majority being 2nd
and 3rd year R C S students
attracted not only by free
beer and food but also, we
hope, out of interest.
A panel of men in indus-
try and a science teacher
were invited to answer the
questions " H o w should a
candidate prepare him or
herself for interview?", " A
career in science and
technology or manage-
ment—is there a choice, or
are they the same thing?",
"Should one join a small
firm or a large one?", "Is
science teaching a satis-
factory and satisfying
career for the science gra-
duate?".
Supplementary ques-
tions were put from the
floor and a lively discus-
sion was held, the panel
not always appearing to
agree among itself. How-
ever, when the points of
disagreement were ana-
lysed it was found that
apparently diverging views
were the result of different
approaches to the ques-
tion and different aspects
of it being answered, a
fault not uncommon among
examinees at finals!
This kind of function has
always proved very popu-
lar. The Association does
not set itself up as an ap-
pointments board or a
labour exchange, as these
functions are already and
properly carried out else-
where. We have, however,
two commodities in abun-
dance and are happy to
give them away. They are
experience and advice,
but these can only help the
fresh graduate to make up
his or her own mind. We
can also supply informa-
tion concerning careers in
a wide variety of industries
and professions, and can
put students in touch with
people already in industry.
If there is any way in
which you think the Asso-
ciation can help you, then
please call and see Miss
Purnell in Room 310, Col-
lege Block — you might
even get a cup of coffee!
Finally, to all 3rd year stu-
dents — please don't for-
get to join us before you
leave College. You should
have received application
forms etc. last December,
but if you have lost them
come to Room 310 and
sign on — plus your £1 of
course.
Osibisa
No Osibisa concerts can
be unexceptional but few
of their concerts can have
been as memorable as the
one in the Great Hall. It
started off fairly innocu-
ously by Osibisa standards
(i.e. audiences on their
feet by the second num-
ber), I wonder if they too
are getting blase about
audience reaction (see
Rory Gallagher). But then
they always have been
rather proud of their
"Criss-Cross Rhythms that
explode with happiness"
(Sounds pretentious un-
less enunciated with a
West African accent).
Only the thing is, that's
just what Osibisa are
about, happiness, and
what better manifestation
of multi-racial happiness
could there be than two
Newcastle Brown bottles
being bashed in time to
African drums. The audi-
ence could have stamped
and bashed and chanted
"O-SI-BI-SA" all night and
still gone home happy, but
what a fine band they are
musically — with Teddy
Osei's flute hovering like
a hummingbird, and Wen-
dell Richardson's almost
Hendrix-style guitar. A pas-
tiche of such diverse ele-
ments might prove un-
pleasant but Osibisa prove
otherwise. I think the P.A.
system could be improved
a bit so that some instru-
ments, in particular the
trumpet of Mac Tontoh
could be heard a bit better.
Still, it's the percussion
that gets the crowd on
their feet, and the general
bouncy a t m o s p h e r e
dwarfed that of the previ-
ous week. When, just be-
fore the official last num-
ber it was announced that
Stevie Wonder had arrived
and was on stage, the
audience response had to
be heard to be believed. I
wonder how many of the
audience had previously
thought of him as an inept
teenybopper. He took over
on drums in a phenomenal
jam session with Osibisa
and showed what a heavy
technique he had. He has
certainly moved forward
from Top of the Pops and
the Tony Blackburn show.
All this too after a certain
Ents treasurer, who shall
remain nameless, h a d
made him pay admission
because he didn't recog-
nize him. So Stevie Won-
der joins Johnny Winter on
the list of "distinguished
I.C. Ents Guests".
Rory Gallagher
After this concert it was
remarked with regret that
the Blues Club had passed
away when it was obvious
that there is still a great
deal of interest in the
Blues, even when it's
played by the bloated chil-
dren of capitalism. Rory
Gallagher doesn't really
come into this category
but his music is much
more acceptable on a
mass scale than the music
of Bukka White or Robert
Johnson, whose influences
are evident in his music.
Whenever he played a
blues number the audience
went wild, and the same
happened the previous
week with both Philip
Goohand-Tait and Linda
Lewis. Someone should
restart the Blues Club and
make Rory Gallagher its
honorary president, or my
name's not Blind Howlin'
Sonny Blues Boy Peg Leg
Big Fat Pig Meat Jelly Roll
Amor the Original One
Man Delta Blues Band.
But now to the concert,
and what can I add to the
review of "Deuce". After
all, Rory gave the thumbs
up sign a lot and stomped
about incessantly. In fact
every time he stomped too
much the audience rushed
the stage, so he had to be
careful. The reaction was
deserved of course but it
should not pale the music
into insignificance. A nice
balance of old and new,
with "Messin with The
K i d " the pick of the new
songs and the prize for the
most shouted-for song of
the evening going to "Sin-
ner B o y " from the first
album. I wonder if he gets
a reaction like this every
night. It's surprising he
doesn't get s w o l l e n -
headed with the adulation
he is subjected to, but he
made a bow at the end of
every number and gave
profuse thanks at the end
of the evening, "Look after
yourselves", etc. Nice one.
Good Habit opened the
show, all dressed up as
monks in their g o o d
habits. The music was
quite good, the lyrics a bit
artificial perhaps, and be-
tween the numbers they
did try a bit too hard to
be childish. I mean, being
childish comes naturally,
doesn't it? My teddy says
so, and he knows.
