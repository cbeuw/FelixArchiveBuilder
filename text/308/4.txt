"So what if I am
a card-carrying apathist!
Not again! If that blasted re-
cord is played once more, so
help me I'll ruin the machine
single-handed. Huh! "He drives
the fastest milk-cart in the
West . . ." OK, these things do
get a hold on your mind, but I
can't stand that tune. It's a mad
world when you see the kind of
stuff that gets to Number One; I
wish I had the chance to make a
few records and cash in on the
'We Buy Anything' fans.
Come to that, I would fancy a
job of some kind in any case.
But what on earth . . .? Guess
it's time I ransacked this list of
opportunities from the Careers
Office.
Pretty grim reading really.
The ones that sound good take
two people a year, and you have
to be some kind of Einstein to
get through the batteries of test-
ing they give you. Like putting
you for the weekend with a pile
of clean-faced Earnest Young
Men (all of whom know the
names of the entire Board of
Directors) and giving you some
appalling initiative test to see
who "emerges as the natural
leader" (having massacred the
others).
The other firms, where they
take on hundreds and you're
just another mouse on an ever-
lasting treadmill—I can just see
myself opting in for that! Good
grief, you spend your school-
days in a miserable terror of
exams, then you rush/stagger/
exist through university, and this
is the outcome?
Well then, what else is there?
Here we are at the end of the
list, in the dregs of VSO and the
like. Dave was raving on about
them, wanted me to go to some
talk a bod from their HQ gave
last week, but . . . I ask you!
Visions of more Clean and
Harmless Young People. Mind
you, they did send old Larry
to East Africa, and a weirder
character I've yet to meet. Ap-
parently he's doing incredible
things in some remote school,
where he had to help build his
own science lab before he got
going. On the other hand, he's
Head of Department, so his dic-
tator-like instincts are being ful-
filled.
Come to that, I suppose I
• I

know quite a few idiots who've
gone on VSO—and even re-
turned. There was Sheila, who
trundled off to some place near
Malaysia. She fancied she knew
all about it, and nearly collapsed
when she found there were sky-
scrapers and bigger cars than
back home in her own town.
Seems they'd got the outward
signs of development, but were
still crying out for teachers and
technical assistance so they
could cope with it all.
And there was that bore Todd.
Applied without telling anyone,
went off to the West Indies, and
suddenly became so matey, writ-
ing letters to everyone about
the wonderful time he was hav-
ing, how it was Paradise. Worst
of it was, none of us could con-
tradict him: it's not easy to hitch
down there—worse still, he was
probably right.
I don't know. VSO seems to
have a funny effect on some
people. Like Jane. Went to some
Indian college, helping to train
local teachers for secondary
schools. When someone is
shooting their mouth off about
the Latest (and Greatest)
Cause, she never says much,
just looks at them, dead cool.
But hear her describe the things
she's seen—it brings the Third
World bit right into focus. And,
on the other hand, she knows
so much about the beautiful
side of India. I reckon she really
cares; she says she'll go back
some day. Meantime she wants
to teach in an immigrant area
in Britain when she's done her
Cert. Ed. Hardly a soft option,
but she certainly seems keen.
Course, Jeff was ranting on
about VSO propping up neo-im-
perialists and neo-capitalists
and what have you to Dave in
the bar last Tuesday. Wonder if
he's right? No joke if they are,
when they've got fifteen hun-
dred leaping around in the de-
veloping countries. What was
Dave's line? Oh yes, he said
that it would be a lot harder
for any politician to take in any-
one when people became edu-
cated, and that in fact every
VSO was teaching something,
whether a subject or a skill. On
balance I think Dave's right. You
can't keep education back from
people on the grounds that their
happier without it, either. If that
was true we'd still be ruled by
the First Anglo-Saxon Party of
Mercia.
Must be snags though. I sup-
pose they don't blaze them
around their advertising (pretty
silly if they did). Must be no
joke when you're teaching some-
thing to '0' level, and there
aren't enough books or equip-
ment to go round. Or if you're a
medic and you just can't get the
medicines you know are vital.
What happens if you want to
come home? I suppose they fly
you back if something awful
happens but I guess VSO aren't
crazy enough to arrange luxury
flights every time the girl-friend
misses your wit, charm, sophis-
tication, humour.
Mmm . . . The employers of
Britain don't look to be falling
into queues for the pleasure of
my company just at present, so
maybe I'll sample some foreign
shore and see how they feel
about it in a year or two. From
this blurb it seems VSO are keen
for applications: I suppose I
might enjoy teaching overseas.
Let's see, Dave said you just fill
up an application form, and
Bob's your uncle—or auntie, de-
pending—there you are at an
interview.
Oh well, if they accepted him,
maybe they'll even give a thick-
accented, non-polo-playing,
atheistical yobbo like me a
chance! Now where are those
damned forms?
Johny Silvo at IC
or Find the Audience
With the union upper
refec. packed by a capac-
ity crowd of about forty,
Johnny Silvo and Dave
Moses gave their sixth or
seventh performance at IC
Folk Song Club. At pre-
vious appearances of this
pair, the upper refec. has
been truly crowded so why
the change?
The evening started off
with floor players, and
these were quite compe-
tent traditional folk song
singers, but nothing spe-
cial. Johnny Silvo and
Dave Moses came on to a
round of applause that
would have been tumultu-
ous had there been more
to applaud. Starting off
with their usual sort of
music which is good for a
crowded folk club with
Newky Brown flowing, but
after three or four num-
bers of the usual routine
they changed to mainly
blues numbers and this is
what these two are very
good at.
Johnny Silvo is a com-
petent guitarist while, to
my mind, Dave Moses is an
excellent bassist. Some of
the blues numbers that
flowed off the guitar, bass
and voices of this pair
would have brought a typ-
ical Saturday night ENTS.
concert crowd to its feet.
Notwithstanding that, the
music was flowing well be-
fore the interval, and after
five minutes of general
chat, or whatever people
do in intervals, the floor
players were back on. A
free bonus was the join-
ing together of Brillo and
two other players whose
names elude me. Johnny
Silvo and Dave Moses
joined with Brillo (inci-
dentally he is bassist with
Diz Dizley) and there fol-
lowed an incredible ses-
sion with two bassists, one
guitar and one voice for
most of the time, except
for a period with just two
bassists. Superb.
CAMP-
HEBRIDEAN
STYLE
For over ten years this society
has run expeditions to the
Hebrides or Western Isles off the
West Coast of Scotland. These
are camping expeditions held
during the summer vacation.
For the scientifically minded
—if there are any at this College
—the Hebrides offer much
scope for zoology, botany, mar-
ine biology, ornithology (etc.!),
geology, and other 'ologies and
'ographies too numerous to
mention. Many rare species of
this, that and the other can be
found on some of the more re-
mote islands, and it is the
Society's policy to visit these
parts where possible. A typical
expedition camp-site is often
separated from the nearest road
by ten miles of 2000 ft. moun-
tains with no footpath leading
to it; and thus access at the
start of an expedition when the
stores have to be transported
is usually by boat. However it
has been known for an expedi-
tion to carry its several tons of
stores a few miles in pouring
rain.
DO IT AT NIGHT
For the more adventurous,
Hebridean hiNs, although rarely
exceeding 2000 ft., offer quite
good climbing: sea cliffs are
notoriously difficult. An in-
creasingly popular pastime now-
adays is "survival". This is dif-
ficult to define precisely; basic-
ally, what it involves is trekking
out of camp in the middle of the
night—when everyone else is
enjoying a sing-song and cocoa
in front of a camp fire—and
bivouacking in a lonely mountain
pass. Such madness is usually
pursued by groups of four in
adverse weather conditions.
Some parts of the Hebrides are
among the wettest in Britain;
while others only a few miles
away are among the driest. Such
contrasts in weather and scen-
ery give islands much of their
character, which makes return-
ing to them year by year irresis-
tible.
DO-IT-YOURSELF
Community life on these ex-
peditions has a character all of
its own, as you will find out if
you come on an expedition. The
character of an expedition is
made by the people themselves,
bringing what they can offer.
When one is so far from civilis-
ation entertainment must be
home-made, and the success of
many S.H.S. expeditions has
been a great attribute to mem-
bers in creating their own enter-
tainment. Even the technical
aspects of project work have—
believe it or not—been a source
of entertainment in one way or
another.
DO IT IN THE DARK
Of course, not all expeditions
are to the middle of nowhere. A
major project on some expedi-
tions to more civilized parts has
been sociology, and in this field
the project work and entertain-
ment overlap in a completely dif-
ferent manner. During the day a
group of shabbily dressed young
men received cups of tea from
villagers, and in the evening
they went to a Ceiledh in the
church hall. Hebridean culture
has not been very extensively
surveyed, and so one is to some
extent exploring the unknown.
DIG IT
This summer, the Society
should run five expeditions. The
expedition to South Uist, how-
ever, is undersubscribed; so
new members will be especially
welcome on this expedition.
Added to that the Society pro-
poses to continue an archaeo-
logical project begun in 1970.
The site was discovered by the
Society on a schoolboys' expedi-
tion some years ago.
DO IT NOW
Joining the Society is very
simple: one just writes to the
secretary to obtain an applica-
tion form. The rest is self-ex-
planatory. If over nineteen, stu-
dents at I.C. are eligible to go as
Officer on any expedition in
1972; and as officers they do hot
have to pay for anything over
and above their own travelling
expenses. (Junior Officer pay
half-rate). An Officer's task is to
co-ordinate a project, carried
out by schoolboys and generally
look after—that cannot be the
right expresion (No, it's not—
Subed.)—the boys; though on
senior expeditions the boys look
after themselves (!!). Certain
officers have more specific tasks
such as travel officer or camp
administrator; and one cannot
forget the leader.
IT'S FOR YOU
People who have been on
S.H.S. Expeditions have come
back saying how much they
have enjoyed themselves. (On
the other hand, they have come
back saying . . .—Subed). Now
although we are desperately
short of members, we do want
the right sort of people to join
—people who enjoy it a bit, who
enjoy the camp atmosphere, and
can be reasonably self-reliant. I
know that such people exist at
Imperial College, because the
college has its own expeditions.
Interested parties should apply
as soon as posible: it is never
too early, and sometimes too
late.
