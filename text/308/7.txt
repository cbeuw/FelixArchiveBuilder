SPORTS FELIX
Polytechnic Star in
Water Polo Tourney
EDITORIAL
Owing to the weather, the post office and Thames
Poly, no IC first team has progressed in their respec-
tive Cup competitions.
The Rugby Club managed to get the two sides and
supporters to Harlington but not a referee—he did not
receive a card thanks to the G P O . The weather has
caused two further cancellations and it looks as if an
'important' fixture of the opposition will cause more
delay.
The Football Club successfully played their games
with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Xl's all progressing to the
semi-final of the Reserve Cup. The Vth XI was knocked
out early on and let in Goldsmith's II to make up the
necessary four. However the 1st XI were foolish
enough to only draw their game with Thames 1-1, be-
ing somewhat fortunate to get level with a late goal.
Again the Gods have forced the replay to be delayed.
The Ladies Hockey have not been able to play a
single game since Christmas hence the absence of
any reports.
Unfortunately, this term has seen a number of fix-
ture 'cock tips' which, except for one, have been attri-
butable to the opposition. The exception was a side
coming to Harlington to play the extra XV s at rugby
only to find our side in Guildford. IC suffered in the
form of the football 1st and 4th Xl's when the opposi-
tion failed to appear. It was annoying for the 4th's when
they had 11 men and a referee on a freezing cold
pitch in Raynes Park only to discover later that the
game had ben called off on the Friday. Finally, of the
known cases, a game of rugby was lucky enough to
have two referees.
The incidents have been mentioned flippantly but it
is infuriating to at least one of the parties concerned;
especially as it only takes a few well placed 'phone
calls to call a game off. The record of IC clubs over
this matter has, this season, been very good and it is
hopes that this continues. I am not sure how much
the cold weather has to do with other colleges flaking!
The Water Polo tournament, reported in the last
FELIX, was a great success for IC, who finished second
to Polytechnic, and beat ULU. The organisers were
bitterly disappointed at the lack of support considering
the easy accessibility of the swimming pool.
A question is raised here of whether the standards of
IC sport are better than ULU and I know a few clubs
who would fancy their chances against U L U .
Apologies must be tendered to the 2nd XI football
for not having a report on their performances, but they
are so boring to write about since they always win!
The IC Swimming and
Water-Polo Club would
like to thank the few stud-
ents who bothered to turn
up to watch some of the
games in the international
tournament a few weeks
ago. To say we were dis-
appointed not to see more
of you over there would be
an understatement. We
appreciate that not all
those who turned up are
now sold on the sport but
at least they took the
trouble to find out at first
hand just what it is all
about.
As far as the tournament
went, I think it would be
fair to state that everyone
enjoyed it, spectators and
players.
The final table of results
is shown below:—

running out winners by 18
points to 8.
The bitterly cold weath-
er made handling difficult
and the game became
rather scrappy at times.
IC won the toss and elect-
ed to play against the wind
in the first half. Guildford-
ians opened the scoring
with a try after about 10
minutes, after pressing
hard in the IC '25'. Then
some slack play by the IC
defence (the culprit shall
remain nameless) allowed
Guildfordians to score a
further try in the corner to
make the score 8 points to
nil. This setback made the
IC team play harder and
the margin was reduced
when John Mcdonough
made amends with a good
try after a passing move-
ment in the Guildfordians
half. A penalty kick by
Dave Rimmer made the
score 8-7 in Guildfordians
favour and only resolute
defensive work by IC pre-
vented further score be-
fore half time.
Jim Hunt ran 50 yards
for a good try soon after
evenings, being commit-
ted to training with the G B
squad. Their strength, as
usual, resided in their
speed of swimming and
overall team strategy.
Nevertheless, IC gave
them a run for their money
losing by a score of 9-17.
Like most team sports,
water-polo games cannot
be won by individual per-
formances when the stand-
ard of play is high. How-
ever, two names should be
mentioned: Peter McCart-
ney and Cliff Spooner.
Pete was the key man in
the organising of our
offence (he is also a mem-
ber of Polytechnic) and
Cliff Spooner was the
main factor in organising
the overall team strategy
(ex-Olympic G B player).
Both these players helped
in giving the rest of the
team enough confidence in
their playing ability to
guarantee us the second
position.
Our victory over the
London University team
was probably the biggest
upset of the tournament.
By winning, IC established
the re-start, to give IC the
lead. Alan Roberts scored
a try and Dave Rimmer
kicked another penalty to
make the final score 18-8
to IC. But for poor hand-
ling by the IC backs (at-
tributable to the weath-
er?!) and rather weak
tackling by the team in
general, the IC score
would have been bigger.
Some tightening up all
round is needed before
the long awaited Gutter-
idge Cup match against
Goldsmith's College. We
hope to regain the services
of the IC captain who
should get his 1st team
place back, after spending
a short while playing for
the A1's.
On the same Saturday,
a rather drunken Ex 1st
XV lost 3-4 to Old Guild-
fordians 2nd; the A1 XV
drew 9-9 with O.G.'s 3rd
XV; and the celebrated B2
XV annihilated the opposi-
tion (U.G. 4th) 44-0.

itself as one of the strong-
est university sides in the
country (some would say
the strongest). To further
boost our reputation, we
defeated the Penguin
Club which came third last
year in the senior division
of the country.
As far as Cologne is
concerned, we feel that
they thoroughly enjoyed
their visit to this country
even though they did not
win any matches. Their
standard of playing has de-
creased in the last two
years but remains at a very
acceptable level. In fact,
they were not thrashed by
any of the other teams
since the scores always in-
dicated a close match.
Furthermore they did win
the beer boat races held
at our reception after the
tournament.
Our only hope, as a
team, is that future tourn-
aments will attract great
numbers and that more
people will get to know
our sport. We sincerely
hope that this tournament
has helped to lay the
ground work.
Cricket
During this term the
Cricket Club will be prac-
tising at Gover's Indoor
Nets in readiness for the
coming season. At the
start of the term the attend-
ance on a Sunday after-
noon has dwindled but we
hope that as many old
lags and 'experienced'
freshers will appear on at
least one Sunday. For
freshers who have not yet
been and hope to play dur-
ing the summer then the
nets provide ideal practice
for the perfect wickets that
Arthur prepares at Harl-
ington. The committee
hopes that as many people
as possible will take ad-
vantage of these excellent
facilities—meet 3.00 p.m.

The 3rd XI is currently
enjoying its most success-
ful season for several
years. Lying third in the
first reserve division of the
ULU league, having won
seven out of 10 league
games, and also through
to the semi-final of the UL
reserve cup competition,
along with IC 2nd and IC
4th Xl's. The main reason
for this success has been
a keen, well-balanced side
with plenty of good res-
erves.
Since Christmas we
have beaten Q M C XI 3-2
at home in a very close
game, the winner coming
only five minutes from
time (scorers A. Peterson,
R. Smith, A. Hallard) and
Q M C III 3-2 away, despite
a brilliant glancing header
into his own goal from
Bob Gibson, leaving 'keep-
er Reg (oops, there goes
another lob) Jinks with
no chance at all. Scorers
(at the right end) E. Neap,
R. Smith, R. Day. The other
noteworthy success of the
term was a 4-0 victory
over Kings II in the cup.
The opposition decided to
give us a chance by only
bringing nine players and
were duly punished for
such impudence. Scorers
on this occasion were A.
Lafferty, R. Smith, R. Gib-
son and I. Hyslop. But near
misses came from R. Day
(about 15 of them).
Regular players this sea-
son have been Bob Bar-
