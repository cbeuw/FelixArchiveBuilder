NUS Extraordinary
Conference
On the 29th/30th of
January a 2-day Confer-
ence was held in London
to debate and resolve NUS
Policy on Northern Ireland
and Union Autonomy. A
very militant Conference
took a clear line on the
issue of Northern Ireland
—asking for the end of in-
ternment, the withdrawal
of British Troops, a United
Ireland and the support of
all groups defending the
minority community in the
North, including both the
regular and provisional
wings of the IRA. However
it was clearly stated that
difficulties of an immediate
United Ireland solution lay
not least in the Irish repub-
lic itself, still bedevilled
by legacies of a social,
economic and religious
nature.
A strong, unrepresenta-
tive, lefty policy on an
issue we shouldn't be dis-
cussing many might say. I
hope the many saw the
plight of Derry that Sun-
day. No concern of ours?
Internment? British troops?
On Autonomy a mammoth
debate left a still far from
distinct approach. Negotia-
tions were still rejected. A
broadening of the cam-
paign to link it with such
problems as James, Roths-
child, etc., was accepted.
A March Day of Action
was called for. Perhaps the
biggest change was the re-
jection of public account-
ability, a decision that split
Conference. My personal
view was an unsatisfied
one at the outcome of that
debate. However Birming-
ham Conference will be
coming up soon and ICU
will have to resolve these
issues internally if its voice
is to be clearly heard
then.
It is hoped that copies
of the completed motions
will be available from the
IC Union Office when this
Felix is published, or in
the near future.

Many will have seen the
televised film of this exped-
ition that was built up as
an example of internation-
al co-operation a n d
finished in an example of
international chaos. One
man killed, half the party
walked off moaning about
the Anglo-Saxons' mono-
poly, and the final ascent
stalled by bad weather and
poor logistics. Was this
final outcome the result of
national disharmony, the
filthy weather, or just too
many great climbers want-
ing their piece of the cake?
The televised film did its
best to expose all, but all
that was exposed was the
life at base camps. To find
out the true story, or at
least a version of it, the
Exploration Society have
invited Don Whillans, who
with Dougal Haston spent
two gruelling weeks on the
face while the bickering
was going on in base
camp, to give an illustrat-
ed lecture on his experi-
ences on this expedition.
This will be on Tuesday,
29th February at 8.00 p.m.
in the Great Hall. Tickets
are obtainable in advance
by sending a cheque pay-
able to the Exploration
Board for 30p per person
to the Exploration Society,
via Pam in the Reception-
ist's Office.

H O T DOGS
Are your meals lacking
interest?, are you fed up
with cockroach and chips
at Mooney? Do you long
for a change of diet?
Dream no more! For two
whole weeks IC will be
tempted to sample the gas-
tronomical delicacies of
Methsoc Hotdogs.
These tasty snacks will
be available at every major
function during rag fort-
night, and during the space
of 14 days we hope to sat-
isfy hungry IC students
with 2,500 hot dogs. Meth-
soc (or Imperial College
Methodist Society to give
its full title) has continued
this fine olde English trad-
ition since time immemor-
ial, and even as far back
as 1964 !
The Landsnapper Sneeze
LETTER TO
THE EDITOR
Dear Sir,
May I beg space to raise
the airing of Refectory
complaints.
In all refectories points
arise which merit com-
plaint. However, all too
often customers are reluc-
tant to air them publicly
(for fear that nothing will
be done?), and the com-
plaint is not corrected.
The Complaints sub-
Committee hopes to start
an effective system by
which complaints will be
put right quickly, but its
efficiency depends upon
the active support of all
Refectory users.
Notices will soon be put
up in each refectory ex-
plaining what should be
done, but I feel that an ex-
planation here could be
helpful.
We divide complaints
into two classes:—
1. Direct complaints
(particular meals, dirty
cutlery, etc.): complain to
the counter staff, if they
are unhelpful ask for the
Chef or the Supervisor.
Enter the complaint in the
Complaints Book, even if it
was rectified, stating what
action (if any) was taken.
2. General complaints
and suggestions: enter
these in the Complaints
Book.
Complaints Books are
being issued to all pay
desks with instructions
that they are to be avail-
able on demand. If your
demand is refused, see the
Supervisor or the Com-
plaints Officer. These are:
Union Building: Steve
Cann: Beit 32.
College Block: Mike
Baum: Beit 30.
S o u t h s i d e : Duncan
Locke: E.E.P.G.
Emerging complaint pat-
terns can then be seen
quickly and corrective ac-
tion taken.
Good points are equally
important, if you notice
any that should be adopt-
ed in other refectories, be
as quick to tell us as you
are to complain. It could
all help to improve the ser-
vice given.
Finally, No Smoking not-
ices will soon be put up,

Travelling Scholarships
A bequest has been
made to the National
Union of Students to allow
for the award of three
scholarships of not less
than £50 for the purposes
of travel during the long
vacation. Such travel
should be devoted in part
to projects connected with
the applicant's field of
study, and those receiving
grants will be expected to
write brief reports on their
project which may, if suit-
able, be published by
NUS in relevant journals.
Obvious examples of suit-
able projects are visits to
factories, research centres
or university departments,
devoted to an applicant's
field of study. It is not in-
tended that the travel
as will price lists before
the counter service and at
each pay desk.
Yours faithfully,
FRANK POTTER,
Chairman, Refectory
Complaints Sub-Com-
mittee.
should be purely for a
study purpose of this type
and the short type of pro-
ject indicated may well be
carried out over a few
days, during a longer holi-
day.
The award is open to
both undergraduate and
postgraduate students, but
other things being equal,
preference will be given to
students in some branch of
Engineering with particu-
lar reference to Electrical
and Electro-Chemical Eng-
ineering.
Candidates must have
been a member of the uni-
versity for two or more
years and must be nomin-
ated for the scholarships
by the representative stud-
ent bodies of the Univers-
ity Unions or Junior Com-
mon Rooms who should
submit the names of the
nominated candidates to:
Education and Welfare
Department,
National Union of
Students,
3 Endsleigh Street,
London, WC1 ODU.
