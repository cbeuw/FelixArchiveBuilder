editorial
If you have seen the
front page of this issue
you may think that our
main headline is a little
unfair to the Union execu-
tive. Perhaps as far as
most of them are concern-
ed it is. There is however
no doubt that as far as the
few people involved in
proposing this stupid
motion are concerned, we
have shown too much
kindness by far. Anybody
who had had any close
association with the Union
office will know the petty
minded, bickering which
has been going on now for
quite some time between
two leading members of
the executive. It is not sur-
prising that a crisis such
as this, has occurred be-
cause of lack of communi-
cation (their excuse not
ours) when these two
people have for a time re-
fused to be in the same
room together. Surely any-
one who intends to stand
for a Union position should
be sufficiently responsible
to realise that even if they
are not in love with other
elected officials of the
Union they have a duty to
the Union to get on with
them or resign.
One of less pleasant
aspects of being editor of
this newspaper is that in
the past week no less than
three, fairly well substan-
tiated allegations of gross
corruption amongst Union
members and certain staff
members have reached my
ears. It is not my job to
investigate or bring to jus-
tice the people involved,
though it is my respons-
ibility to do something
about it, just as it is the
responsibility of every
member of the Union to
ensure that their money is
not being misused or fall-
ing into the wrong hands.
I am pleased to say that
two of the allegations I
have been able to clear up
with very little fuss or un-
pleasantness. Unfortun-
ately one remains. There
are a few people in this
college who I do not wish
to name, who are con-
vinced that the recent rob-
bery of Ents. funds was not
the unfortunate incident it
appeared at the time, but
a pre-planned theft by a
few people directly involv-
ed in Ents affairs. It is a
great pity that this ex-
tremely serious matter
should cast gloom over
the whole of the Enter-
tainments committee at a
time when their new found
success should bring them
all the credit they deserve,
especially as most of them
probably have nothing at
all to do with this sordid
affair. I can therefore only
ask anyone who knows
anything about this rob-
bery to come forward and
say so, so as the culprits
if indeed there are any,
can be found and at least
the money recovered. If
the criminals are not pre
pared to confess then
feel that the Union officials
have a responsibility to
investigate the matter fur
ther if only to convince us
that the robbery was genu
ine and not, as many
people excluding myself
believe, 'a put-up job'. If
the Union officials will not
do this of their own accord
then they should be man
dated to do so by their
Union.
what's on
HOBMAN
despairs
Student Unions will never be
the most popular organisations
but neither should they have the
reputation that they seem to
have at the moment. Perhaps
the trouble stems from within
the organisation itself, perhaps
it's our fault that our organisa-
tions are so rotten, hope that
this is the situation because
this is the only area that we can
ever usefully influence.
Are student unions merely a
playground for would-be politi-
cians and bureaucratically mind-
ed demi-gods who seek only to
bully the student sheep? I don't
think so. If it is the case then
I've had enough. I want no
more to do with it. Most 'con-
scious' students must surely
have a loathing and a contempt
for the life that they are being
trained to lead when they leave
the college factory. Surely they
must realise the corruptness of
industry, surely they must real-
ise the selfishness necessary,
the striving to carve one's own
niche in society, surely they
must . . . . But alas, they don't.
Otherwise they would come for-
ward and form a society, a union
to help others and to try and
equalise the burden of unfair-
ness that so many people seem
to suffer from.
Oh yes, it's easy to criticise.
I've done it so many times. Yet
how hard it is to create. How
hard it is to make something out
of a union. How hard it is to
spend £33,000. Isn't is difficult
to sit through 1\ hours (again)
of council trivia while remaining
sane. Did I say trivia . . .?
Obviously thinking of buying a
new glider is trivia, naturally
no one really wants to change
the structure within the union,
naturally no one is interested
where the student councillor
should go. (You've never heard
of her—well of course you
haven't, because there aren't any
communications in this place).
Let everyone go mad. No one
cares any more. Cleaners arrive
every morning at 9.00 in blue
plastic macs, kick the bird out of
bed (sorry there aren't any
women in this place and anyway
they embarrass the other resid-
ents on the landing when they
come out of the shower in the
morning, so that's not allowed).
Lecturers arrive at 9.30 and still
the labs go on, still the spools
on the computer turn. Little
fluorescent stickers say lights
out, spring thing, SUK . . . FUCK.
Oh why do we bother, why
do we care, what are Union
meetings, what is council, why
don't we just do it all ourselves?
Are we frightened just to cio
what we want or is there some
mistaken belief that perhaps
someone somewhere else would
like a say in what happens. Do
people take any notice any
more?
What does it really need to
make people notice? Surely we
still don't need a gimmick, sure-
ly we don't have to make it in-
teresting? For probably the one
time in your life you can actu-
ally achieve something. This is
probably the only time you'll be
able to stand up and shout:
'I don't agree' and find support,
find an opportunity to be an
equal.
Oh please believe, don't leave
us, we need you, without you
we are nothing, without you we
don't exist, without you there is
only the Imperial College .. .
Yours faithfully,
DAVE HOBMAN

hi-fi-soc
on record
Dear Sir,
The Christmas issue of Felix
carried a feature on Hi-Fi. The
Imperial College Hi-Fi Society
would like it to be made known
that the article was not submit-
ted by any of its members, and
does not necessarily express
our views.
Whilst we commend the basis
of the article, we feel that it
may be rather misleading to the
novice, since it contains some
rather obvious errors and inac-
curate descriptions. For ex-
ample, one cannot purchase a
good stereo tuner for less than
about £60. Furthermore, it is
untrue to state that no further
expenditure is needed, having
bought your tuner and aerial.
Not much sound emanates from
a phono plug!
Noise is inherent in any elec-
trical system, and in any am-
plifier worthy of the 'Hi-Fi' label
it is not caused by poor quality
components or bad connections
but is determined by the design
of the circuit. Wow and flutter
is rarely more than 0.1% in the
cheapest turntables, and should
preferably be of the order of
0-05%. The author of the Christ-
mas article suggests that 0.5%
is adequate.
The paragraph about fre-
quency response is completely
incomprehensible. We suggest
that whilst a response of 30 Hz
to 17kHz (± 5 dB) might be
adequate for a loudspeaker, the
frequency response of an am-
plifier should be better than 20
Hz to 20 kHz (± 2dB).
It is extremely dangerous to
take distortion figures seriously
unless full qualification is given
As an example, a stereo ampli-
fier which meets the author's
specification of less than 0.05%
distortion (at all powers up to
rated output, and at all frequen-
cies within the audio bandwidth)
would cost at least £200 ex-
cluding preamplifier.
We feel that the author is mis-
guided in categorizing Hi-Fi
equipment according to price,
as this often has no bearing on
its quality, which is a more
suitable criterion. Moreover, at
the time the Christmas article
appeared in Felix, the following
recommended units were no
longer being manufactured:
Goddmans Maxim, KEF Con-
cord, and Leak Sandwich loud-
speakers, and the Leak Stereo
70 amplifier. Some of the others
recommended were, in our opin-
ion, of doubtful quality and/or
outdated design, e.g., Goldring
GL69 deck and Shure M44E
cartridge.
It is beyond the scope of this
letter to give our own equip-
ment recommendations, but we
hope that if any reader wants
further information or advice,
they will join Hi-Fi Soc, and
avail themselves of the extra dis-
count on new equipment which
is obtainable for members.
Yours faithfully,
for

... in the

The large majority of our openings for new graduates
in 1972 will be for electrical and electronic
engineers for design and development work, and
for mechanical and other engineers for the
industrial/production engineering areas.
The competition for good jobs is likely to increase
this year, and we are having to plan our
interview schedules on the assumption that there
will be more applicants for each opening than
hitherto.
Our interviewers try hard to be unbiased, but
being human they tend to favour candidates who
know what we do and what we have to offer.
Our booklet "Information for Graduates — 1972"
is available from University Appointments Boards,
and it gives the dates of our visits. Reading it
could make quite a difference to your career
prospects.
