EGM Motions Entertainments
ICU Motion on Third World Debt
(1), (2), (3) and (4).
Proposed by Jacob Tompkins, Civ
Eng P G and seconded by Mark
Richardson, Physics 2
ICU Notes
1. That UNICEF estimate 500,000
children die every year as a direct
result of the debt crisis.
2. That of the 17 most indebted
countries, 14 are suffering rapid
loss of rainforest area.
3. That last year the Third World
transferred $51 billion more to the
West in debt payments than it
received in new loans and aid
combined.
ICU Further Notes
1. That the British banks have
played a major role in the debt
crisis. In the 1980s they received an
average of over £2 billion in interest
payments a year.
2. That British banks have also
received considerable tax relief for
their provisions made for non-
repayment of the debt, but have not
actually cancelled any debt. It is
estimated that the banks have now
received over £ 3 billion in tax
payer's money.
ICU Believes:
1. That, without substantial relief,
development in the Third World is
impossible.
2. That the debts of the poorest
countries should be completely
cancelled.
3. That the debts of the other major
debtors should be cut by at least one
half.
4. That the June 1992 U N
conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Janeiro
must include such debt cancellation
as an essential step towards
protecting the environment.
ICU Instructs
1. The president to write a letter to
the Union's own bank expressing
concern at the bank's role in
perpetuating the debt crisis and
requesting a clarification of the
bank's present policy.
2. The president to write to the
Minister of Overseas Development
urging the U K government to insist
on substantial debt cancellation at
the June 1992 UNICEF in Rio de
Janeiro.
3. That all cheques processed by the
Union be stamped with the
message: 'Stamp Out Third World
Debt Now!'

Third World Debt (2)(3)(4).
(Hereafter edited due to space
pressure)
In addition to the points raised in
motion (1), motion (2) notes that the
'big four' high street banks
advertised in Union Handbooks and
that this advertising should be
suspended until their Third World
Debt is cancelled. In addition, their
promotional material should not be
published in any Union media
subject to the same caveat.
Motion (3) asks that the 'big four'
not be allowed to attend ICU
Fresher's Fair and motion (4) asks
the same for ICU Career's Fair
until the bank's Third World Debt
is cancelled. In all cases the
President is instructed to inform the
banks of the Union's decision if the
motion is carried.

The Sensible Season is upon us.
Exams loom. It's time to knuckle
down and get on with doing what,'
after all, we all came here to do in
the first place. Drinking.
Even if you've been revising all
Easter, there's still time to chuck it
all away. The subject in question is,
of course, the traditional Exam
Blues Ball, a depraved mixture of
food, drink, gambling, leching and
exotic dancing, tonight in the
Union.
Death Bang Party make their long
awaited return. Led by the
inimitable Dr Death Bang, the man
whose penis needs no introduction,
DBP are a bit saucy to say the least
and definitely the best party band
around. Catch them on stage in the
Concert Hall around midnight.
Headlining in the Lounge are
firm IC favourites The Trudy.
There will be bands on all night
long, plus food, drink and the
glittering gold lame all star C & G
Vegas-style casino.
Doors open at 8pm. The bar stays
serving until 2am, everything
finishes at 3am. Tickets available
from the Union Office (£4.50) or
£5 on the door. Bring your Union
card. Remember, no entry to the
Quad unless you've got a ticket or
are a Beit Hall Resident.
Ents say: you'll wake up on
Saturday with a head as vacant as
Man Utd's trophy cabinet.
