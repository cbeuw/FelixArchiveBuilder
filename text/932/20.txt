1 May 1992 Felix 932 Clubs & Societies
Sponsored Ten Pin Bowling
Imperial College Tenpin Bowling
club recently ran a 14 hour
sponsored bowl to raise money for
the Sportsmans Aid Ward, at
Middlesex Hospital. The ward
specialises in the treatment of bone
cancer in adolescents, and during
the last 12 months has been treating
amongst many others Phil Wren,
the current vice-captain of the club.
In all the sponsored bowl
collected £821.26, which will be
used to brighten up the time that
patients spend in the ward whilst
receiving their chemotherapy and
radiotherapy treatments. Top score
of the bowl was 200, which was
achieved by Wayne Wightman and
Pete Sharp.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank the Megabowl
at Streatham for offering us very
cheap bowling rates during our
bowl, and all the club members who
turned up to bowl and helped in
raising the money. Many thanks.
Pete

Well what can we say? Who would
have thought that Imperial could
have a more successful women's
running team than men's? After a
particularly amazing performance at
the Teddy Hall Relays in Oxford on
Wednesday 11th March, us girls
(Edwidge Patel, Kristina Semple,
Kate !?! and Maria Raimondi) went
on to win no less than 15 medals
between us at the U L
championships at the Tooting Bee
track (Sat 14th).
The IC men's team turn out in
Oxford was a bit disappointing.
Paul Northrop (captain) was the
only one there and ran for the
Mars
On Saturday 2nd May at 7pm in
Elec Eng 912, Richard Taylor will
be speaking about 'Mars
Aeroplanes'. His lecture includes
details of high altitude aeroplanes
on Earth, the NASA marsplane and
two marsplane designs of his own.
Taylor is an ex-research chief at
British Steel and a long standing
lecturer in astronomy and planetary
science for the department of extra
mural studies, London University.
All are welcome to this talk.
Kevin Higgs (Ex-chair of SEDS)
university team. The women's team
consisted of Kristina and Maria. But
as there were supposed to be three
runners Maria ran twice (mad!).
Despite this apparent handicap, the
team came third overall.
At the U L championships, the
men's team was satisfying number-
wise as well as performance-wise.
This time Paul Northrop was not
there - and where was Lawrence
Fawkes, the supposed organiser of
the championships? Anyway, IC
was certainly well represented and
the team is by far the best in London
University judging from this last
meeting.
