What!?
The National Student Television
Association's annual conference
took place in Brighton during the
Easter vacation. Imperial College
Union's television station, STOIC,
won first prize in the video to music
category and third in the
documentary section. The winning
programmes have already been
shown. The winner of the music
section was produced by Olivier
Crepin-Leblond and the extract in
the documentary class was by Alex
Weidmann. (iCNN).
Sources from St Thomas' Hospital
and the Charing Cross Hospital
have reacted angrily to newspaper
reports this week that they are to
close. The prospect of these
teaching hospitals being axed was
raised by the left wing pressure
group, 'London Health
Emergency.' In their report,
'Countdown to Crisis', they say the
consequences could be the closure
of 2,000 beds, 100,000 fewer
London operations, and the loss of
10,000 NHS jobs.
The report alleged that a secret
inquiry, headed by Sir Bernard
Tomlinson, is drawing up a hit list
of proposed hospital closures. 'We
are sounding the alarm now, to alert
the public to the danger before the
changes are announced,' said John
Lister, Information Director of
London Health Emergency.
The publication of the report has
been greeted with scorn and
derision. A spokesman for St
Thomas' Hospital said that London
Health Emergency were to health
what the Socialist Workers were to
politics. 'London Health
Emergency never check their facts.
Their reports are badly researched
and generally erroneous. They are
a constant irritation. They are
provocative and childish. Their
report i is completely without
foundation.'
A spokesman for Charing Cross
Hospital said that the story had
caused a lot of worry, but that as
the rumour had been going round
for over a year, it was about time
that Charing Cross was mentioned.
The rumour is being fed by the
uncertainty caused by the
Tomlinson inquiry. Sir Bernard
Tomlinson has been appointed by
the Department of Health to look
into the provision of health care in
London. The inquiry is not due to
report until after the summer, but
it has been widely rumoured that the
inquiry is to recommend closure of
two hospitals. London Health
Emergency has seized on this to
claim the existence of a 'secret
agenda'. This the Department of
Health denies. Hospitals minister,
Dr Brian Mawhinney, said 'it is
nonsense to suggest their is a hidden
agenda. Sir Bernard Tomlinson's
inquiry into health care in London
has yet to come to any conclusions.
London Health Emergency are
simply scaremongering.' Labour's
Hospitals Spokesman. Harriet
Harman. was unavailable for
comment. (iCNN).
Pram Prix
Imperial College Day Nursery is
celebrating its 21st birthday by
holding a 'Nursery Awareness Day'
on 15th May. The day will feature
a 'Celebrity Pram Race' around
Prince's Gardens, with barrels of
beer awarded for the outright
winner, the most beautiful celebrity
baby and the most technologically
advanced pram design.
The prizes have been sponsored
by IC Students' Union. The
Chairman of the Day Nursery
Appeal Committee. John Kilner,
invited departments and clubs to
enter teams for the Pram Grand
Prix. 'We hope to raise funds for
the modernisation of the Day
Nursery facilities. The race will
raise a lot of money through
sponsorship and will be great fun
for all the participants.'
Entry and sponsorship forms can
be obtained from Ian Gillett, at the
Safety Office, 14 Prince's Gardens.
Completed entry forms should be
returned by the 4th May.(iCNN).
Brook
Peter Brooke, the Member of
Parliament for Westminster South,
the constituency in which IC is
situated was defeated this week in
his attempt to be elected speaker of
the House of Commons. Mr Brooke
was challenging Ms Betty
Boothroyd. the M P for West
Bromwich. In a free, ie non-
partisan, vote, Ms Boothroyd
received 372 votes compared to Mr
Brooke's 238.
The defeat of Mr Brooke was in
part due to his recent cabinet post
as Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, a post which he lost in the
recent cabinet reshuffle. Ms
Boothroyd has been a deputy
speaker since 1987 and has not held
cabinet office.
Speaking after the election of Ms
Boothroyd, Mr Brooke said, T want
to be among the first of the
backbenchers to congratulate you
on your elevation.' (iCNN).

An estimated thirteen thousand
