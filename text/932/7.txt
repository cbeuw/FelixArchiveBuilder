Madam
Butterfly
Blood red flowers strew the garden
where the American sailor
Pinkerton chose his musmee,
Butterfly. For him, it is a marriage
of convenience to pass the time
before his next posting. For the
young innocent, it is her life. It is
the tragedy of the blind faith of one
of Japan's most glorious assets, its
women, against the western casual
lover. Her dogged belief in her
husband' is all the more pitiful as
he returns with his American wife
to adopt Butterfly's son Sorrow.
With her one last reason to exist
gone, she ends her desolation by her
father's sword.
This is not a depressing piece.
Butterfly's eternal enthusiasm
beams through her companion's
realism. Susan Bullock as Butterfly
could never be taken for a 15 year
old Geisha, but then suspension of
reality is at the heart of such a
rending performance. Her vocal
emotion and dexterity did not fail
Digging

and
White
Woman
Street
Digging for fire is unfortunately
no longer showing at The Bush, or
indeed anywhere. I am mentioning
it here to bring these points to your
attention. The play was probably
the best I have ever seen, for the
following reasons. The venue was
very good, the company of actors
was excellent, and the playwright
a genius in his analysis of human
nature.
I therefore ask of you to
remember the following and look
out lor them in the future. The Bush
Star
Wars
to entwine their audience into her
exploited world in 19th Century
Japan.
David Rendall. as Pinkerton,
gave an equally stoical portrayal,
every mannerism and tone
expressing his temporary affection,
disregarding Butterfly's dedication,
as she abandons family and religion
to honour him alone.
The set is stark but striking.
Strident images grasp at the flimsy
Japanese screens. Pinkerton leaves.
Theatre, the Rough Magic theatre
company and the playwright Declan
Hughes. Rough Magic will be
performing another Declan Hughes
play. Love under Bottles, at the
Tricycle Theatre (071-328-1000)
from the first of June. A review will
be forthcoming at about that time.
Now to a play that you can still
see. White Woman Street was a
small trading town near Ohio. In the
late 1800's. it was so named
because of its brothel, which was
said to contain the only white
woman for 500 miles. In the
1890's. a woman was said to have
been brutally murdered there. The
murderer was never' brought to
justice.
Twenty years later, five outlaws
are heading toward the town. They
follow a man known only a
'Trooper', due to his having fought
in the indian wars. The play opens
with a long monologue from
Trooper, and as the play continues,
each character vocalises his
thoughts, as well as talking to the
other.-characters.
All but Trooper talk of the gold
train they are to rob there. James
Miranda imagines himself a 'proper
gentleman', with enough money
that his colour will no longer
matter.
and the abandoned garden returns
to grey mud. Now it is Butterfly's
colour that cheers the drab and
disrepaired house.
This is a glorious and emotive
production - everyone should
experience Butterfly.
The Dissident
• Madam Butterfly runs at the
London Colosseum to June 18th.
Tickets £4.50 ( on the night ) to
£42. All operas are performed in
English.
Trooper thinks only of 'a
ghost (he) must bury' in the town.
What this means is held a mystery
until the end. Trooper is such a
gentle man, yet he feels such guilt.
We can only guess why.
Although this mystery lies at the
heart of the play, White Woman
Street is far from a mystery. The
core is human nature, how we judge
ourselves, and torture ourselves for
the past. In this field, the play is
hugely successful. Its failing lies in
another area.
To enjoy a play, film or book to
the full, you must be able to suspend
your disbelief, immerse yourself
into the production, so that you are
living it. and become part of it
rather than just 'watching a play'.
The scenery is elaborate at best but
watching five men ride across the
American landscape without horses,
can stretch your sense of
perspective quite severely. Either
you can take it, or you can't. If you
can then the play is good. If not...
White Woman Street will be
showing until the 16th May with a
performance for deaf people on the
7th. The Bush Theatre can be
reached on 081 743 3388, and can
be found on Shepherd's Bush
Green.

Yes, they're back in the first book
of the new Star Wars trilogy,
picking up where the movie trilogy
left off. Five years after the
destruction of the Death Star and the
defeat of the Emperor, Darth Vader
and the Empire, the rebel alliance
is in the process of setting up the
New Republic. Our old friends
from the films are all busy of
course. Han Solo is now chasing
around in the Millenium Falcon
with the Wookiee. Chewbacca,
trying to enlist smugglers to the
cause. Princess Leia Organa Solo
(you remember that Han and her
finally got it together at the end of
Return of the Jedi) is now a
diplomat and trainee Jedi and Luke
Skywalker is still a wishy-washy
dreamer even if he is a Jedi now.
Anyway, while the heroes are all
pottering around in their new
Republic, things are stirring in the
Empire's little corner of the galaxy.
Things like a Grand Admiral with
amazing tactical prowess. Things
like a clone of one of the old dark
Jedis. Things like a massive store
of Empire technology and long lost
military secrets. Things like little
furry snakes which cancell out all
affects of the Force ('May the force
not be with you' I suppose!).
Before we get very far the
Empire is making its comeback.
Out come the Star Destroyers and
TIE fighters, X-Wings and Star
Cruisers and the battles begin again
in the same old War. To make
things even more interesting, a little
bit of unrest in the New Republic's
council is thrown in for good
measure and we find out that Leia
is carrying two Jedi twins which the
empire is out to kidnap.
This is an exciting read, full of
all the sort of action we've come to
expect from the films. It certainly
kept me enthralled with plenty of
throwbacks to the original trilogy
and an excellent sense of continuity.
I recommend this book to all Star
Wars fans and sane people alike. As
far as more possibilities go, it's
been nearly fifteen years since the
first Star Wars movie and I do
wonder if we will see Mark Hamil,
Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness
again in a new set of films. Well
they did it for Star Trek.
