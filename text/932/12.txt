The 'Macedonia Question' has
been poisoning the relations
between Balkan nations even before
the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Its
knowledge is one of the major keys
to understanding the restlessness
and ethnic rivalry which is the
trademark of 20th-century Balkan
and European History.
The interests of the Great
European Powers (with the
exception of the U K which has
taken a fairly uninvolved stance)
and of the lesser regional powers,
having shifted often during the 19th
and 20th centuries, all these nations
have played around with the ancient
History, linguistics, geography and
recent History of Macedonia, in
order to support their diverse and
rival claims on this area.
This article is an attempt at setting
the record straight, using neutral,
scholarly sources, and at
denouncing the tapestry of lies,
patiently woven by each country to
favour its own interests!
The situation today
Before getting to the historical
arguments, it is good to know the
political situation nowadays:
Macedonia is a region of Northern
Greece: one of the largest regions,
with 2,200,000 inhabitants, the
capital of which is Salonica
(Thessaloniki), the second Greek
city in size and importance after
Athens.
From 1944, when Tito, the
communist absolute ruler of
Yugoslavia, re-organised the
country, until last year, there was
a second 'Macedonia', one of the
constituent Republics of the
Yugoslav Federation, with 2 million
inhabitants. Before 1944, this
region was known as South Serbia
or 'Administration of Vukovar'.
Although it is universally
recognised that this former
constituent Republic is one of the
less homogenous regions—
ethnically and culturally—of the
world; its government now seeks its
transformtion into a sovereign state.
For this to be achieved, a systematic
stifling of all political disidence,
cultural differences and ethnic
identities within it. is attempted.
Ancient history of Macedonia
According to the famous ancient
Greek historian Herodotus, whose
texts are the closest to the
considered period reference, the
Macedonians were these Doric
tribes which, instead of moving
southwards towards southern
Greece and its isles, stayed close to
the river Haliakmon, at the North
of the Greek Peninsula. According
to the Encyclopaedia Britainnica,
since the Macedonians were not
seafarers and had not therefore
takers advantage of their coastal
areas, these were colonised by one
of the most dynamic Greek cities of
the time (750-650 BC), Chalis, on
the Greek island of Euboia, a few
miles from Athens. The ethnic
composition of Macedonia became
thence exactly identical to that of the
rest of Greece. Today, still, the
main coastal area of Macedonia, in
Greece is called Chalkidike.
The name Macedonia was first
conferred to this area by its King
Amyntas III (reigned 393-370 BC),
the grandfather of King Alexander
the Great. At that time, Greece was
composed of independent sovereign
cities (like Athens and Sparta) and
their dependent areas. It had ethnic,
linguistic and cultural unity, but no
politcal one.
Alexander the Great gave Greece
its political unity, through war as
well as intricate diplomacy. He can
therefore be considered as the first
King of Greece.
He went further, driving the
united Greek army to the East: Iran
(Persia), Iraq (Mesoptamia),
Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt and
India. This time (ca. 330-280 BC)
was named the 'Hellenistic Period',
after the Greek name for 'Greece',
survived him a few decades,
Macedonia—together with the rest
of Greece—falls in the hands of the
Romans (168 BC), then becomes
one of the key regions of the
Byzantine Empire, and falls again,
together with Constantinople,
Athens and Sparta, to Turkish rule
(15th century AD).
Modern history of Macedonia
Macedonia became, as a
1 May 1992 Felix 932 Opinion
geographical concept, a part of the
Ottoman Empire. In 1828, part of
Greece gained its independence,
followed by Bulgaria (helped by the
Greeks) in 1878. In 1912,
Bulgarians, Serbs and Greeks
together liberated the soil of
Macedonia from the Turks (Modern
History Review). In 1913, the, by
far, greatest part of Macedonia
joined the Kingdom of Greece, this
part was populated by Greeks,
except for a 10,000 strong minority
of Pomaks (i.e. Bulgarian speaking
Muslims). Another, much smaller
part of Macedonia, containing 25
different ethnic groups, joined
Serbia. (N.B. All population data
are meant after the completion of
population exchanges provided for
by the treaties).
During the First World War,
Bulgaria, siding with the Germans,
attempted to snatch the Serbian part
of Macedonia, but it was conferred
to Serbia again, at the end of the
war.
Yugoslavia, the new country to
include Serbia, Croatia and
Slovenia, was founded in 1929,
and, at the end of the Second World
War, Marshal Tito (a Croat)
reorganised it into a federation,
cutting off pieces of Serbia, which
was too large compared with the
other constituents of Yugoslavia.
One of these parts Tito cut off and
named 'Macedonia'. It contained of
course, the small part of the
historical region of Macedonia,
which had been conferred to Serbia
in 1913, but this accounted only for
30% of the new so-called
'Macedonia'. The other 70% was
Serbia pure and simple.
Serbia had to accept this situation
until Slovenia's and Croatia's
successionist moves in 1990, which
led to Serbia claiming back its
former territory, which she had had
to surrender under the Communist
rule, for the sake of the Yugoslav
Federation which no longer exists.
The linguistic question
The notion of 'Macedonia
language' is one of the most
commonly twisted and used
arguments, by anyone who wants to
make a claim on the area. Here are
the facts, according to the
Encyclopaedia Britannica: when
linguistics talk about Macedonian
language, they refer to an extinct
ancient language, a direct
descendent of the comon Indo-
European, and precursor of Greek.
Macedonian developed into Greek
by the 2nd millenary BC and was
never heard again.
What then is the modern Slavic
language which the Government of
the would-be pseudo-' Macedonian
independent state' (the former
South Serbia) promotes as
'Macedonian'?
This language does not exist (I
have already mentioned the cultural
disparity of the region) except as an
artificial formalism. In fact the
former South Serbia speaks dialects
in the North which are very 'similar
to the Serbian ones', in the East
something which is 'shading into
Bulgarian', in the West dialects
which sound very much like
Bulgarian, but which change from
city to city; 'The central dialects of
the cities of Prilep and Vales were
elevated to the status of language
during the Second World War'
(1940, and were then officialised by
Tito and formalised by his team of
pseudo-linguists as 'Macedonian'.
Their use was then imposed to all
the other parts of the new
Constituent Republic.
Population Statistics
In the Greek region of Macedonia,
there is. as we said before, a ten
thousand strong minority of Pomaks
(Bulgarian-speaking Muslims). The
total popultion of the region being
2.2 million, the minority represents
ca. 0.4%.
The Yugoslavian ex-'Constituent
Republic of Macedonia' (i.e. South
Serbia) has a 200,000 strong Greek
minority (i.e. 10% of the total
population). Another 23% are
ethnic Albanians, Bulgarians,
Turks, Pomaks and Serbs,
recognised as ethnic minorities.
The remaining 67% are Serbs
which were known as South Serbs
until 1940, as well as a few
Albanians and Bulgarians. These
have been named by Tito, in 1944.
'Macedonians': some are proud of
their newly-invented 'identity'.
Others strongly refuse this imposed
trademark.
Conclusions
This ends the presentation of the
most relevant facts. Each one can
draw from them their own
conclusions. However, I will,
referring in turn to all the previous
sections, attempt myself to answer
the question behind all this: 'What
should happen to the former
'Constituent Republic of
Macedonia', i.e. South Serbia, now
that the Yugoslav Federation is
falling apart?'
Taking historical arguments
alone, it is clear that the part of the
region which corresponds to ancient
Macedonia (and which still has
200,000 Greeks in it) should join
Greece, the rest (the greatest part)
being returned to Serbia.
Adding to these the linguistic and
demographic arguments, we may
conclude that part of the Serbian
piece should hold a referendum for
joining Bulgaria. Indeed, the
separation of this territory in three
parts (Greek. Serbian and
Bulgarian) would be the best
solution, not only according to
International Right, but also for the
freedom and well-being of its
inhabitants.
A small independent state,
bearing the enmity of all its
neighbours, would be reduced to
starvation and isolationism,
therefore totalitarianism. It would
also have to oppress all the
recognised minorities within it
(which constitute, as we saw, 33%
of the total population), for the sake
of preserving an artificial statist
unity.
Is this what Western Europe, and
this country in particular, mean
when they talk about post-
Communist freedom and well-being
for Eastern European peoples? Is
this what they mean by respect for
the minorities? Is this their version
of the Truth?
