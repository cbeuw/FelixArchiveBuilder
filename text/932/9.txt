Reduced Shakespeare Co.
complete works Sikulu
The R S C tear through
Shakespeare's works, from Romeo
And Juliet, not quite as quickly as
Dire Straits managed, but quite
quick nonetheless, to Hamlet, faster
than the cigar commercial, like their
rival West Coast Dudes Bill and
Ted. Their treatment of Othello, the
moor, is outstanding. At least, it
would be outstanding if it wasn't
surrounded by 36 other exceptional
pieces. Totally fuckin' awesome.
Excellent. Ted!
A N D Whether you love or hate
Shakespeare and whether you love
or hate that awesome, west coast,
surfing scene, you won't be able to
sit through this with a straight face.
1 know. I tried. It's sharp,
imaginative, energy-packed and just
damn silly at times. Buy two tickets,
take a friend and get a taste of our
literary heritage - American style.
You won't regret it.

The Lise Yates and the totally
awesome Miss D.
The first five minutes of this show
are breathtaking. Fantastic
costumes, powerful voices, fierce
drumming and traditional South
African dancing. And then you wait
for something else to happen, but
nothing else does happen. Sure,
they change costume and tempo and
scenery but basically it's the same
formula. There's an attempted
storyline but I think this was just put
in to give the dancers time to change
costume. There was no real attempt
at acting (I hope!). The awful sound
and lighting didn't help and it all
became too much for me when the
vicar started grooving.
If I want to see a carnival, or
better still be part of it. I'll go to
Notting Hill in August. If I go to
the Theatre I expect more than this.
They do what they do really well
but it's not enough to make Theatre
and it wasn't enough to keep me
there after the interval.

Darwen
Worshippers and the Way
The Nexus is a cosmic empire,
spanning universes and
civilisations. Unfortunately the
Chasm Gates, trans-spacial
doorways, between these universes,
collapsed over twenty millennia
ago.
This is the backdrop of Hugh
Cook's latest novel Tfie
Wor.s/ijppers and Tfie Way.
Asodo Hatch, a purple(!)
skinned, muscle bound. Frangoni
warrior, has family problems,
money problems and a wavering
religious conscience. His opponent.
Lupus Lon Oliver has none of
these. Diminutive, red-skinned, an
Ebrell Islander his only problem is
the large superiority complex
inherent in his race. He is a member
of the free corps, dedicated to the
Nexus, and one can't help but
wonder if the Nexus is still around
now. 2 0 . 0 0 0 years since the Gates
collapsed. He is also in love with
Asodo's sister who is currently
obsessed with evolving into a fish
by spending as much time as
possible, sat fully clothed in the
bath! To add a little extra space, a
long dead religion, which killed
billions of people before the Gates
came down, manages to rear its
ugly head and before we know it we
have two conflicting coups
underwa\ with Asodo and Lupus
bang in the middle. The book
proceeds with no end of deals and
sneakiness on all parts, all narrated
• w'ith'an undertone of dry wit, that
of a bemused observer. Whilst
complete in its own right this is the
ninth volume of Hugh Cook's
spectacular fantasy epic. A well
written gem of science fiction
fantasy the only bad point with this
book is that you'll immediately
want to rush out and buy the other
eight.

Mikado
If you voted Conservative, then go
and see this; it requires a big
helping of 'suspension of disbelief.
Gilbert and Sullivan is to opera
what Airplane is to cinema - a big,
camp, mickey-take. There is some
still-relevant satire at the heart of it,
but you have to work very hard
(some would say too hard in these
surroundings) to get at it, and it
might well put you off 'real' opera
if you're not already hooked.
But as Mikado's go it was a fairly
good production. Some of the
singers were good, especially
Katisha (Jill Pert), Ko-Ko (Fenton
Gray), Y u m - Y u m (Lesley
Echoross) and Nanki-Poo (Julian
Jenson). However, from the back
of the stalls it was hard to hear the
words in ensemble sections. The
staging was clever with lots of
funny effects, (although the ENO's
version, I think, just outshone it).
If you can afford it and can battle
through the 'Politically incorrect'
aspects then you will have a mildly
satirical 'hoot' and hear some
familiar tunes.
