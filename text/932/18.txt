On the final Wednesday (18th
March) of last term, the knock-out
stages of the Nat West Bank
sponsored Imperial College Indoor
Soccer Tournament took place at
the volleyball court. Eight teams
had reached the second phase of the
tournament, who were all hoping to
be the champions and collect the
first prize of a grand shield, £75 as
well as miniture trophies for each
member of the team.
The qualifying teams were ICFC
2 (1). Chemical Engineers (2),
Cypriots (3). Snooker 1 (4),
Lebanese 1 (5), ICFC 1 (6), Sikh
2 (7) and Islamic 1 (8). Each of
Eng (the free-kick experts) played
ICFC 1 (the tournament favourites).
This turned out to be a heated affair,
with both teams struggling to
produces their best form. However,
Chem Eng managed to pull out all
the stops and go 3-0 ahead. After
a half time pep talk by captain Marv
Abdo. ICFC 1 managed to crawl
back into the game with 3 second
half goals. Full time was creeping
ever nearer, with the possibility of
the first extra time of the
tournament being played, when
ICFC 1 scored in the dying minutes
to win 4-3.
So the final was the ultimate in

these teams had battled through a
three week long gruelling fight in
their respective groups to qualify.
The final group placings are shown
alongside this text.
Each of the qualifying teams were
seeded according to their
performance in the first phase of the
tournament (shown in brackets
above). Thus the quarter-finals
were contested between the best and
worst seeds (ie seed 1 vs seed 8,
seed 2 vs seed 7, seed 3 vs seed 6
and seed 4 vs seed 5). The results
of the quart-finals are shown below.
The first semi-final was contested
by ICFC 2 (strong on the passing
game) and Snooker 1 (the team with
the most skilful player in the
tournament). And indeed this is
how the game progressed until half
time, with ICFC 2 dominating the
play, but Snooker 1 always scoring
on the break with their ace player
Mahendra Surani. However, with
Snooker 1 tiring. ICFC 2 stepped
up a gear in the second half and ran
out winners 10-6.
In the other semi-final. Chem
grudge matches between the two IC
football teams. With little to choose
between the two sides in terms of
skill, the game was close until half
time, with ICFC 1 leading by 4-3.
However, in the second half, with
an injury to Rakesh Muthoo (ICFC
2 captain), the extra substitute and
fitness told, and ICFC 1 romped
home with a 8-4 victory.
Representatives of Nat West
Bank awarded the IC 1ST shield to
the tournament winners together
with the small trophies and a cheque
for £75. ICFC 2 collected a cheque
for £30 together with runners-up
medals. The losing semi-finalist
each received cheques for £10.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all the teams
for taking part in the tournament,
the Nat West Bank for sponsoring
the event, and Gunny for helping to
organise and referee the matches.

PS The medals and trophies have
now been engraved. So these are
now ready for collection, together
with the winning cheques.

I have decided to clear out my
pigeon holes ready for a new
term. During this process I have
noticed that I have accumulated
quite a few photographs. So could
the appropriate people collect
their respective pictures by next
week. Below is a list of clubs from
whom I have acquired the
pictures:

Normally I would send them

is a chance of the photos being
lost, and I do know how you all
love to keep those precious
momentos. Many thanks.
