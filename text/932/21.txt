The Assay Lab
#
and
how
to
comport
oneself
therein.
Phoenix, November 1923
A Noble place, lofty and
commodious, and fitted with
several very powerful self-acting
stenches. The morning's work
begins officially at 10am, but in
practice it is best to roll in an hour
(or some hours) later. In order to
make up for this late arrival all good
assayers take the precaution of
leaving the Lab very early. The
work itself is fairly arduous,
consisting mainly of chatting with
one's neighbour, or watching things
boil, fume, trickle, drip, run, bust
or disintegrate. Occasionally one
may be called up to juggle with the
assayers's most important
instrument—a slide rule, but if the
required answer is first obtained
from a guileless demonstrator this
is unnecessary. At the end of each
morning someone makes the big
noise for an hour or so, and it is
found best to retire to the Union
during this ceremony. Returning to
the Lab, after a light luncheon, at
2.30, one must be careful not to
stay, in an excess of zeal beyond
3.15, as at this hour large quantities
of miners are liable to drift in. They
then indulge in their post-prandial
orgy of glass-smashing and
attempted asphyxiation. Like
miners all the world over, they are
rough and uncouth, though some
show signs of a belated attempt at
civilisation, by the moral uplift gang
of Chemistry Part 1. To the
majority of them, however, the use
of the fume cupboard is unknown,
and they are never thoroughly at
home until it is impossible to see
more than 3ft in any direction.
However, before this stage is
reached, most metallurgists have
retired, to leave them to the full
enjoyment of the atmosphere until
thrown out by the night-watchman.
If all would-be assayers model their
conduct on the lines indicated
above, I feel sure that they will
prove not only a credit to their
profession, but also to the
demonstrators and lecturers who
give so much of their valuable time
to assist them.

The 3rd term is upon us with all the
evils this brings. But never fear,
Rag is here, to relieve the tedium
and stresses induced by college
work and exam fever. The first big
item on offer to ease your tortured
minds is The Great American
Adventure Weekend. Thanks to
those amazing people at UNICEF
we are able to offer you the chance
of an amazing day out at Derby
American Adventure Theme Park
at under half price, with all rides
included, on May 9th or 10th. A
massive theme park with Grand
Canyon log flume, corkscrew and
all the fun of the fair, what better
way to take a relaxing break from
your revision. If you decide to go
on May 10th you also get the chance
to see our amazing Bungy Jump
team. And we do have limited
tickets available which include
transport on the 10th so you can
accompany the troupe of heroes.
Make sure you get there in time. If
you fancy joining the bungy jump
team arid thereby gaining free entry
into the park and free transport
come along to the Rag meeting in
the Union Lounge at 12.40pm for
more details and sponsorship form.
The jump costs £38 but you get this
back if you raise £ 1 0 0 in
sponsorship. Team places are
limited to 10 so there's a strict first
come first served rule. Tickets cost
£4 or £7.50 including travel and are
available from the Rag Office at
lunchtimes and the Union Office.
