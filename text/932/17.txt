issue of
'Phoenix'
This element called woman is a
member of the human family and
it has been assigned the chemical
symbol W O . The accepted atomic
weight is 120, although a number
of isotopes have been identified
having weights ranging from 95 to
400.
Occurrence: It is abundant in
nature; found both free and
combined, usually associated with
man. That found in the U K is
preferred.
Physical properties: A number of
allotropic forms have been
observed. Their density,
transparency, hardness, colour,
boiling, and melting points vary
within wide limits. The colour
exhibited by many specimens is a
surface phenomenon and is usually
due to a more or less closely-
adhering powder. It has been found
that an unpolished specimen tends
to turn green in the presence of a
highly polished one. The boiling
point for some varieties is quite
low, while others are likely to
freeze at any moment. All varieties
melt under proper treatment. The
taste varies from sweet to very
bitter, depending upon the
environment and treatment.
Chemical Properties: Absorbs,
without dissolving, in a number of
liquids, the activity being greatly
increased with alcohol. Absorbs
seemingly unlimited amounts of
expensive foods. Some varieties
catalyze the food into fat according
to the formula PV = NRT. Many
naturally occurring varieties of WO
are highly magnetic: in general, the
magnetism varies inversely with the
Chemical Nature of Women
density and size, directly with the
square of the valence, and inversely
with the cube of the age. Some
varieties tend to form Anne-ions;
others cat-ions. Their ionic
migrations vary widely. A l l
varieties exhibit great affinity for
Ag, Au and Pt, and for precious
stones in both chain and ring
structures. The valence toward
these substances is high and its
study is complicated by the fact that
the residual valence is never
satisfied. Many stable and unstable
unions have been described—the
latter in the daily press. Some
varieties, being highly explosive,
are exceedingly dangerous in
inexperienced hands. In general,
they tend to explode spontaneously
when left alone temporarily by
man. The application of pressure to
different speciments of W O
produces such a variety of results
as to defy the principle of Le
Chatelier.
Use: Highly ornamental. Wide
applications to the arts and domestic
sciences. Acts as a positive or
negative catalyst in the production
of fever, as the case may be. Useful
as a tonic in the alleviation of
sickness, low spirits, etc. Efficient
as a cleaning agent. Equalises the
distribution of wealth. Is probably
the most powerful (income)
reducing agent known.

IC Impressions
By a 'woman
student' - from
the June 1932
issue of
'Phoenix'
At first sight it would seem
comparatively easy for any woman
to give her ideas and impressions of
the Imperial College, but on further
consideration the whole subject
seems to offer an amazing number
of obstacles. It is hardly to be
expected that her impressions will
be unbiased by personal
observations; in short the ideas
expressed are essentially those of
the individual, and must not be
accepted as the considered opinion
either of women in general or
college women in particular. Few,
if any, of you fully realise the
obstacles we have to overcome. For
many reasons the women's colleges
such as Bedford, Girton or
Newnham have many advantages
socially, but after all, most of us
have to face the future seriously,
and the necessity for choosing a
career has been forced upon us
owing to the present economic
conditions. Women (for the most
part) are essentially 'synthetic'
scientists.
The frigid and austere
atmosphere during the first few
weeks in the college strikes one
forcibly, especially since most of us
have come from girls schools where
we have been treated as individuals
instead of in the 'mass' action way
of a university. The real difficulty
is of course the smallness of
numbers, which makes any form of
social life and activities an
unsurmountable obstacle. Perhaps
it would have been better had it
remained an entirely masculine
college. From the point of view of
work it offers many advantages to
the student, but there is a wide field
and a possibility of vast
improvements. We may be to
blame, since for the most part we
seek seclusion rather than publicity.
Occasionally we try to serve some
useful purpose; we are willing to
help, but it is for you to ask! The
college and its traditions are ours as
well as yours, but lack of
enthusiasm seems to typify the spirit
of today.
Perhaps the effect of working
together under similar conditions
results in a general apathy towards
college women, and you seek
change and new society after
college hours. Sometimes you
discuss and invite criticisms, but for
the most part we are relegated to the
background. One wonders
sometimes whether the college
women are particularly peculiar or
unusual. It is a debatable point and
it may be that on first consideration
they are, and that, for the majority,
is the only consideration.
Even if we are scientists, yet we
still remain human. Though
victorianisms and chivalry lie
buried in the past, sometimes we
may sigh for those far off days, for
our ideals are hidden beneath the
bold front and cynical outlook of
twentieth century equality.
