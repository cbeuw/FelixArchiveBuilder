1 May 1992 Felix 932 Music
Shakespear's Sister, PWEI
Candyland
-T&C
-Metronome,
Folkestone
with 'Rainbow'. On the relative
strengths of tonight's performance.
I'd say that Gallup are making it all
up.
Candyland are rocking it tonight.
Roaring their way through
'Kingdom'. 'Fountain', and the
rest. Growl. Their best tonight,
according to the time honoured
Felix polling method, was
'Something To Somebody', which
was simply superlative.
Shakespear's Sister, in dresses
more sparkly than Poddy's boots,
have only four good songs all night:
'Stay', predictably enough was well
received, but Marcie's voice started
to lose it in the opening section:
'You're History' was much better;
and 'Goodbye, Mr. A" is third of
these three songs, grouped together
at the end of the set so that we have
to stay to see them. There was then
a long pause, an encore, another
pause, and then, oh surprise, a
second encore, with the final good
song. 'Hello (Turn Your Radio
On)'. Every other song they do just
fits into a formula. To be frank they
were disappointing. More
amusement was found from the guy
immediately in front of me, who.
to be frank, couldn't dance to save
his life. At first I thought he was a
comedy sideshow.

*Candyland's album. 'Suck it and
See', is out now. Shakespear's
Sister have a single, out now. and
play Westminster Central Hall. 21.
22 May.
What is the point, I ask you? The
venue is not overly packed tonight.
Perhaps this is just a little too
secretive. The tension is mounting.
Enter PWEI. Anyone would have
thought that Jason Donovan had just
walked into a pre- pubescent school
hall.
Clint & Co. proceed to showcase
their new material, title-free, and
heralding a return to their
Stourbridge roots, so betrayed by
their last album, Cure For Sanity,
in which they sold their souls to the
devil, and became a) a parody of
their former selves, and b)
successful. The new material, in
which they deny that they were ever
a happening dance band, leads to a
slightly lethargic attitude from the
crowd, from which they are only
relieved by the occasional insert of
'Can U Dig It?'. 'Wise Up Sucker',
and a particularly bleak 'Def Con
One", sample-free, and desynthed
in a guitar frenzy. And with
'Everybody's Happy Now', they're
gone.
The crowd leave, disaffected with
the lack of familiar tunes,
disappointed with the showcase of
new material, and live drummer.
Maybe that's the point.

• Pop Will Eat Itself release a
new single at the end of May. and
play 5 nights at the Marquee in
June.
Mega City Four-Shivering Sand
Mega City Four return after the
release of their 'Sebastopol Road'
album with three new songs, and lo
and behold, they're actually quite
good. The lead track blunders along
quite nicely, and rest follow it
through in their own imitable style.
All credit to them for not living off
the album.

*Mega City Four release Shivering
Sand" on 7". 7" Live ep, C D , and

Tuesday.
Ride
-Going Blank Again
(Liz Holmes) Ride on Harvey Moon.
This is hard. Gone are the rather
harsh and grating clamour. 'Leave
Them All Behind' is here, a
majestic ramble that lacks nothing
and has much more. 'Cool Your
Boots' start with someone muttering
something about stopped clocks but
wait a few seconds and a track hits
you between the eyes that will leave
a mark for years, times to come.
They have left the harshness that
was so at home in the small, dark,
venues. This is music on a far
greater scale. It burns into you mind
leaving tracks and splinters still
smouldering. They still look like
four of the most miserable bastards
in the world but it's the music that
counts and here it comes in
bucketfuls.
The vogue may have gone and
many of the lesser players have long
since left the field but they will
remain.
It may not move them from the
realms of culthood to the palace of
mass popularism; it's not an album
for your Mum to relax to. It's a
classic; it's not their best. Yet.
Pebbles
• The album, and the single
'Twisterella' are out now on
