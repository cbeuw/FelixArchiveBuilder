HON SEC (EVENTS) Toby Jones proposed by Chris Stapleton
Why am I standing for Hon Sec?
After colleagues in the Union asked
me to consider the post, I decided
to run because I can do an excellent
job. My sponsors have offered me
a job, but a Sabbatical post would
let me devote time to the Union. I
like helping people, organising and
implementing new ideas and get
along well with everyone.
I have been on Rag Raids and
various collections, and will be
organising charity events like video
game tournaments and silly sports
in cooperation with Rag. I will also
offer support to halls to arrange
inter-hall competitions such as
knockout pool and swimming galas.
There could be more variety in
the Ents discos, perhaps in the form
of theme discos (like Rag's Abba
disco on May 15th). Being
independent, I would also liaise
with Ents and Jazz & Rock to bring
in some better known bands,
perhaps even a classical concert or
two!
The new catering laws are bound
to affect us, but it should still be
possible to lay on an evening's
entertainment with food thrown in,
like country or barn dancing with
a buffet or an Indian food night.
There is a mass of ineffective
posters around college. I would
reorganise the publicity rules and
introduce a weekly list of events on
noticeboards in the JCR and the
Lounge. I would like to screen films
in the Union regularly and a 35mm
projector would give ICSF and Film
Soc access to more recent releases.
With the help of the Union
Manager, the Union building must
continue to be improved, especially
the toilets which are still
disgraceful. It's also a priority to
computerise room bookings on a
simple system in the Union office.
Finally, bring back the Bouncy
Castle!
HON SEC (EVENTS) Dominic Wilkinson proposed by Graham Lawton
The Union needs somebody to
oversee its events. As Ents Chair I
think I understand that as well as
anybody. That's what the Hon Sec
(Events) should do, but doesn't.
Next year's Hon Sec needs to
appreciate the demands of the job
and have the experience to do it
properly. Dominic has sat on the
Ents Committee for three years,
two as an executive members. He
is the only candidate who can
delivery. Vote for him.
If elected I will
1. Hold events on every weekday
night catering for all tastes to attract
students into the Union.
2. Efficiently publicise Union events
via an integrated publicity network
encompassing Hall publicity reps,
a posterboard in the Snack Bar
advertising forthcoming attractions,
a weekly Felix article, use of the dot
matrix system in the JCR and
listings in Time Out, London
Student etc.
3.Make feasibility studies on:
^Purchase all Union publicity from
a single supplier with the envisaged
reduced costs.
ii)Appointment of permanent events
manager.
iii) Long term re-location of the Ents
Lounge building a self contained
club and in the short term refurbish
.the existing Lounge.
iv)Widening the student attendance
at events via loop holes in the public
performance licence/temporary
membership scheme (if they exist).
\ (Computerisation of Union
bookings.
4. Coordinate events via regular
meetings with the chairs of Ents,
Rag, Scab and any other college
societies and clubs intending to hold
events to discuss their needs and to
provide any assistance necessary.
5. Co-host events with the CCU's
and most importantly with St
Mary's.
6. Produce a small booklet for the
Freshers' mailout highlighting the
services provided by the Union,
containing at least a two week
events diary to generate their initial
interest in the Union.
7. Develop student identity with the
Union and Union identity with the
student.
