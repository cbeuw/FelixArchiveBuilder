Grand Canyon
of adulthood. Claire's life is at a
turning point, and she is finding her
society an even more confusing
place, Mack is an immigration
lawyer, increasingly obsessed with
the fragility of life. His fears nearly
become real one night when he has
a brush with disaster. Danny Glover
is Simon, the tow truck driver Mack
credits with saving his life. Simon
is trying to maintain his family,
which includes his deaf daughter
and his sister, who lives in fear that
her children will not survive the
neighbourhood gangs. Steve Martin
is Davis, Mack's best friend and a
successful producer of brutal, ultra-
violent movies. Mary-Louise
Parker is Mack's secretary. Dee,
and Alfie Woodard is her best
friend, Jane, two single women
trying to overcome the loneliness of
a harsh urban life.
We do have, I'm glad to say an
exceptional film—it's a tapestry of
characters, it's about the smallest
things and the biggest things—but
it never gets too soppy, remaining
unnervingly realistic. These people
aren't trying to change the w o r l d -
just trying to accept it and make
their lives better by trying to
understand it. We have a great
cast—a fantastic soundtrack and
superb ending. If you see one film
during your exams see this, in fact
see it anyway—humans at their
best.
Poo.
In 1991 Los Angeles, six people's
lives intertwine in a way that will
mark them forever. Transformed by
a series of unsettling and often
surprising encounters, these six—
family, strangers and friends-
come together in writer-director-
producer Lawrence Kasdan's
probing look at his adopted home.
As the world around them careers
seemingly out of control, each tries
to bring a semblance of civilisation
to his/her life—and to keep the fear
at bay...or so the press material
says. It does admittedly sound
rather boring and 'plot-less' but
what ensues over the 2 hours 14
minutes odd of brain-bashing is
something surprisingly clever,
disturbing yet soothing, harsh but
realistic.
The story in its skeleton form is
a drama about big-city dwellers
grappling with the harsh realities of
contemporary urban life—you
know the sort of thing—murder,
racism, rich and poor etc. Kevin
Kline and Mary McDonell are
Mack and Claire, a couple with a
teenage son teetering on the brink
Aliens -
This is not Alien 3, although there
is a trailer for it before the film
starts. This is the second of the
trilogy re-released on video with an
extra seventeen minutes of footage
previously unseen and is sometimes
pompously described as the
Director's Cut. So what do we get
for £12.99? Well, I received a
freebie poster from Woolworths as
well as my seventeen minutes—but
are they worth it? Basically yes.
The story has definitely filled out.
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), for
those who remember the first film,
Alien, has a daughter and she
intends to return to being her
mother despite having been in
special
suspended animation and drifting in
space for fifty-seven years. We are
also shown the colony on Plane
LV426 prior to the Alien
emergence and introduced to Newt
(the eight year old girl Ripley
befriends). The remaining minutes
are devoted to four automatic
sentries mentioned in the earlier
edition but never actually seen. All
in all definitely a meatier version
storywise but little extra actionwise.
If you do not already have a copy
and have waited for it then it is
worth the wait. If you do have a
copy I would advise renting the
special edition beforehand.
P.S. If you have seen videos in
the shops with 'Widescreen' on the
cover (such as Star Wars and Die
Hard) Aliens (special edition) has
a few clips to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this format.

his load on Poo.
Photocopier II
This, the second in the series of
photocopiers, comes to us in colour,
unlike the original's atmospheric
black and white, and with
marvellous sound effects in Dolby
Stereo ( selected theatres only ). It's
just like being there.
The hero of the photocopier is a
rabbit, whose name we never find
out, and Photocopier 2 is about his
exploits through the galaxy of paper
duplication. At only only 5p (B&W)
or 40p (Colour) per sheet of A4 this
must be the entertainment bargain
of the year.
