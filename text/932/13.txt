People have been studying the
weather for millennia, and deduced
little more than that a red sky at
night can cheer up a shepherd.
Scientifically usable measurements
date only from the middle of the
nineteenth century, and even these
measurements bring with them a
whole raft of problems.
The readings are far from evenly
spread but instead concentrated in
what would have regarded itself as
the 'civilised world' (mostly
western Europe) and, for very good
reasons, almost entirely over land.
There are sea based measurements,
but these are prone to their own
peculiar errors and, concentrated,
again for obvious reasons, on the
major trade routes.
That is not to say that researchers
have not tried to deduce something
from this data. Teams of
researchers from the University of
East Anglia (UEA), and from the
Meteorological Office, have
produced estimates of global yearly
average temperatures going back
well over a century. Writing in the
August 1990 edition of 'Scientific
American', two of the U E A team,
Phillip Jones and Tom Wigley,
described a technique that is as
much an art as a science.
To produce an accurate record of
temperature from the available data,
the researchers had to take into
account more than just the accuracy
of the individual readings.
Temperature can vary over
horizontal distances of just a few
metres: the atmosphere cools
rapidly with height. Weather
stations do not necessarily stay in
one place, and simply moving a site
slightly down a hill would lead to
a completely spurious warming.
Even sites which stay put can be
affected by changes in their
surroundings. Those which, though
they were once mostly surrounded
by fields, were engulfed as the
population and the cities expanded
are prone to what is known as the
heat island effect.
Heat is more readily absorbed
and re-radiated by bricks and
mortar, than by soil, and large
urban areas are invariably local
'hot-spots': another source of
spurious warming.
The measurements of
temperature over the sea are sparse
and bring with them their own
unique errors. Before 1853, there
was no, internationally agreed,
standard method for measuring sea
surface temperature. Sailors, who
had better things to do, used the
rough and ready technique of
lowering a bucket into the sea,
pulling it up and putting a
thermometer into the water. It was
the buckets that gave the
researchers their problems.
A simple canvas bucket is quite
a good conductor of heat compared
with, say, a wooden bucket and any
water in the canvas bucket will
warm or cool comparatively rapidly
in the open air. In the middle of the
nineteenth century, scientists began
to realise the importance of
standardising the readings.
For this reason that it was decided
that, as part of an agreement to
share meteorological measurements
signed (where else) in Brussels in
1853, all ships were forthwith to use
wooden buckets. The decision was,
by and large, completely ignored.
Most ships continued to use 'non-
standard' buckets until the 1940s
and it was only after the second
world war and the invention of the
plastic bucket that usable data
became available. Jones and Wigley
say that the bucket-induced
climatological error could be as
high as 0.7 of a degree.
See Figure 1: the evidence for
Global Warming.
After years of work, the research
teams believe that they have a series
of global and hemispheric mean
land and sea temperatures with all
the noise, from expanding suburbs
and the cooling buckets, taken out.
They estimate that their data, taken
from the middle of the nineteenth
century onwards and averaged over
ten years, is accurate to within 0.1
degrees Celsius. It quite clearly
shows a warming of around 0.4

degrees Celsius over the last
century.
It can be difficult to see what
difference a change this small could
possibly make: 0.4 degrees is a
fraction of the variation in
temperature normally found on any
one day.
The U E A researchers, with the
backing of computer model results,
believe that global warming will not
be slow and constant, but will start
off small and then accelerate. They *
argue that the 0.4 degrees is not
worrying for what it is, but for what
it could become.
Some researchers believe that it
could become a change of up to 5
degrees by the year 2050. It is a
measure of the uncertainty in the
subject that others estimate the
change to be less than 2 degrees.
The uncertainty over the
temperature change, the alleged
result of the enhanced greenhouse
effect, contrasts with the confidence
with which we can estimate changes
in the concentration of the principle
cause, C02.
Direct measurements of the
concentration of the gas are
available for only the last quarter of
a century or so and these show a
roughly steady increase. To go back
