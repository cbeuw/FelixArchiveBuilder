London Football League
Here are the tables for the
University of London Football
League. As the season draws to a
close, I would like to take a few
minutes to reflect on how the 6
Imperial teams have faired in the
league this year.
I guess I should really begin by

congratulating the 4th team on their
excellent achievement of gaining
promotion to Division 3, for the
first time. The commitment and
team work of the 4ths this year has
been outstanding which, coupled
with a crisp passing game,
blossomed into a lethal
combination. Ruban
Ramachandran, the 4th team
captain, should be commended in
the way he has conducted himself,
and his team, this year. Not only
has he worked hard to ensure the
success of his own team, he also
produced some thoroughbred 3rd
team players and never hesitated in
offering them to higher teams
within the club. He is also

responsible for the invention of the
'shouting game' - long may it
prosper.
On the subject of giving up
players to higher teams, I take this
opportunity to both thank and offer
my sympathy to Andy Stanniland
and Nigel Strevens, the respective
5th and 6th team captains, whose
own teams suffered for the benefit
of the rest of the club. Both sides
struggled in tough divisions, this
year, and just when they looked like
stabilising themselves, out of
relegation danger, they lost key
players to the 3rd and 4th teams.
Under these difficult circumstances
they played some good football and
the team spirit remained high to the
end, a further credit to the
professionalism of Andy and Nigel.
Martin Atherton captained the
3rd team this year, and compared
to the 4th, 5th and 6th team, has had
a relatively quiet year, though still
with an outside chance of gaining
promotion. Martin has done well in
building his side almost from
scratch, never afraid to experiment
with new players. He has been
plagued with the difficulty of having
lads who couldn't play every
Wednesday and Saturday, and did
well in addressing the problem with

the minimum disruption to the rest
of the club, without sacrificing any
success of his own team.
The pressure on the second team
to do well is unfairly large. To
come 3rd on Division 1 would be
the worst result for the 2nds for 5
years. Under this criterion perhaps
the 2nds have had a disappointing
season. However, in the course of
the year we have witnessed some
great football and a fascinating
insight into continental football
management. Italian based 2nd
team captain Rakesh Muthoo, put
into practise his belief that the short
passing game is the way to bring
footballing success, prompting very
favourable comments from referees
on the flair and style of the 2nds
game. An intriguing idea of playing
midfielders as defenders produced
both results for the 2nds and the
balance between success for the
2nds and integration of his side
within the club resulting in some top
quality diplomacy. But, at the end
of the day, the 2nds appear to have

thoroughly enjoyed their season
which, after all, is what it's all
about.
Last, and in every sense least,
Marv Abdo our 1st team captain.
Marv really grasped the job with
both hands this year, implementing
some interesting and fresh ideas.
With the introduction of Monday
night training, he and his sqaud
soon built a strong team bond which
together with the extra fitness,
served them well during the season.
Early success left the lsts high in
the Premier Division, but injuries
proved to be a bitter blow for the
team. Problems with effective
reorganisation resulted in a couple
of defeats against inferior
opposition, which at Premier
Division level is enough to cost the
league. Even though the
championship had slipped away, the
calibre of this years 1st team
showed through as they strung
together an impressive collection of
scalps. One interesting statistic that
evolved from the season is that the
1st team never lost whilst fielding
its strongest side. This confirms my
personal view that Imperial 1st
team, at full strength, can and has
beaten any college side in the
University of London.
