Figure 2: C02 Concentration; Annual Mean Values
any given day does not matter.
One of the first people to study
predictability was Ed Lorenz. He
developed what is possibly the
world's simplest climate model. In
the Lorenz model the entire
atmosphere is represented by just
three numbers and three equations.
These equations contain analogues
to many the large scale effects in the
atmosphere and the model's
behaviour, like that of the real
atmosphere, is largely
unpredictable.
I say largely. Although the values
of each of the numbers do not seem
to follow any simple pattern, their
averages (the climate for the Lorenz
model) stay remarkably constant. It
is just that, the numbers never seem
to reach their average values
simultaneously. This has been
compared to the atmosphere
'orbiting' its mean value.
It is probably appropriate to end
this section by saying that there is
a lot about the present climate that
we can 'predict' with current
numerical models and, possibly,
The great 'Oh
God, we're all
going to DIE'
school of
journalism
many features of future and past
climates too. As the models and
parameterisations are refined, these
predictions should improve but it
will be a long, slow and convoluted
process. Herein lies the problem.
We do not yet know what, if
anything, will happen, but there are
some quite frightening possibilities.
It is these frightening possibilities
that people get to hear about.
THE POLITICS OF CLIMATE
A certain politician was once
described as having an athletic
ability to jump on to any passing
bandwagon. This was unfair, not
because the comment was
undeserved (it wasn't) but because
it blamed one man for doing what
comes naturally to his whole
profession. Bandwagon jumping is
an essential skill for any politician.
It was probably inevitable that the
theory of global warming would
eventually find its way out of the
scientific press and into the tabloids,
and equally inevitable that, when it
did, the great and the good would
jump.
The first reports of possible
global warming were in the great
traditions of the 'Oh God, we're all
going to DIE' school of journalism.
These first stories were a gift to the,
then politically, obscure Green
movement who exploited the
worries for all they were worth. It
would be a bad pun but no
exaggeration to say that the Green
Party's amazing performance in the
last round of European elections
was a 'greenhouse-effect' effect.
It was only after the first burst of
panic that the other, less worrying,
and possibly more accurate,
versions of the theory began to
appear. There has been the
inevitable backlash.
The first counterblast in this
country came from Channel Four's
science series 'Equinox' in a
programme called the 'The
Greenhouse Conspiracy'. It was
largely based on the views of
Professor Richard Lindzen of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, a long time opponent
of the enhanced greenhouse effect
theory. Hilary Lawson, the
presenter, argued that, even if there
was no conspiracy to promote the
theory, there was 'a coalition of
interests... scientists have needed
funds, the media a story, and
governments a worthy cause.'
The anti-greenhouse campaign
has, if not exactly taken off, found
itself some influential supporters.
Recently, a Conservative M P ,
Teresa Gorman, was given a fifteen
minute slot on BBC Radio to say
that the whole global warming
debate was a ploy by 'eco-terrorists'
to keep her away from her car. It
was the sort of well reasoned
argument that should set the
environmental groups off on a
desperate search for Ms Gorman's
missing marbles.
There is a possibility that the UK,
like the US, will start to listen to the
vested interests: the motor and
manufacturing industries who do
not want the expense of reducing
their C 0 2 emissions. The US
government has always refused to
talk about 'global warming',
preferring the neutral term 'climate
change'.
The US anti-greenhouse lobby
has some influential friends. The

former White House chief of staff
John Sununu, recently sacked by
George Bush, was well known for
his opposition to environmentalists
and their calls for reduced
emissions. It is said that he had a
program on his own personal
computer which he thought was
better than any of the large scale
global models.
In the UK, the vested interests are
quieter and more discrete. They are
not any less influential.
The problem with politics is that
politicians need definite proof
before making any sort of decision,
and this proof is simply not
available. With vested interests
shouting from all sides, the
argument that 'we should do
nothing because we do not know
what will happen' becomes very
attractive. No politician, worth his
or her job, will accept that it is
precisely because we do not know
what will happen that we should do
something.
