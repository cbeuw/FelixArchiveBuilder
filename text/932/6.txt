Returning from the Easter break, to
find a plethora of good gigs
coinciding precisely with my
exams, I can simply pass on the
good news to you, and hope that
you behave resposibly and with due
respect to the series subject of
studying and the like. If not...
Tonight, ignoring IC Ents Exam
blues ball, U L U has a much better
selection of bands, namely
Revolver, whose latest ep. 'Venice'
(Hut Records), has a cover of
Strawberry Switchblade's 'Since
Yesterday', which qualifies them as
possessors of extremely good taste,
together with Sweet Jesus, whose
last single, 'Phonefreak Honey'
(Rough Trade) was well recieved by
all and sundry, Lise included,
Wonky Alice, and Butterfly Child.
Alternatively, the notably good

The Barbican's 'Great Orchestras of
the World' season opened with the
Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra
giving a performance of works by
Richard Strauss sponsored by
Deutsche Bank A G London. The
acoustics of the Barbican concert
hall are strange. Visually you feel
close to the action but aurally you
feel quite far away. This is
Germany's oldest and most
respected orchestra and has had
Directors such as Mendlessohn,
Wagner, Mahler and Richard
Strauss.
Their first piece was
'Metamorphosen', a study for 23
solo strings. Strauss was inspired to
Great Orchestras of
the World
-Barbican
write this upon the destruction of
the Munich State Opera House in
an air raid in 1943. It's a gentle,
complex and atmospheric piece and
the finale held me transfixed.
They also performed four songs
with Julia Varady singing soprano,
and Till Eulenspiegels which is a
light-hearted orchestral showcase.
And they did show off. I found it
all very impressive. However, the
music buff (thanks Thomas) that I
was with found the performances
uninvolving and dry. I found the
performances highly professional
and enjoyable. Mr Music Buff,
however, did not. I clapped. He
didn't.
