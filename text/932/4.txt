Music Felix 932 1 May 1992
Claytown Troupe
-Marquee
It's a rare thing these days that a
British rock band can boast the
transition from the Marquee Club
Rock nights to Wembley Arena in
under two years. It's even rarer
when the same band can claim to
have made the same massive leap
back to the Marquee a further two
years down the road. So where did
it all go wrong for Claytown
Troupe?
By tonight's performance there's
not a lot that the band are doing
wrong. More significantly though,
there's not a lot that Claytown
Troupe do that everybody else isn't
already doing too. They know how
to strut, they pose, they've got
attitude but somewhere between
'The Veil' and the new material
they've let originality go down the
Union Bar to bury it's head in a pint
of Websters. Sadly it's a pretty
general and bleak view of the
British rock of the moment. To get
anywhere instead of 'Out There',
Claytown Troupe will have to drag
originality back from the boozer
(Pan pipes and all), sober him up
and give him a good slapping,
otherwise it's curtains, methinks,
for Bristol's finest. There is a spark
among the dying embers though,
CTT can stick kick ass live,
particularly with Alabama, Ways of
Love and Real Life in the set list,
and with a bit of an imagination
injection, who knows, back to
Wembley in '94.

^3==^ 1 may lack in terms of age, but is that
11= Ie 1 1 1 S important? Not yet, and hopefully
never. Have they been corrupted?
• At the moment they lack a little
experience but they can still move
the most concrete of feet. They
make you feel happy to be alive, it
is a sheer joy to hear them. This
because they make music that they
love and they love making it. Its
moments like these, the sheer
excitement, that will remain with
you far after the event. I find it very
hard to describe things I like, if they
had been crap the words would flow
like blood from a deep wound.
Their sound may be out of
fashion but fashion is for people
without self belief .Here you will
find the heart of music: this is what
it's all about.

There was an American band on
first. School of Fish I believe, but
I can't remember much about them
other than I can't remember much
about them. Thousand Yard Stare
came at the end and were their usual
self, a kind of mindless bouncyness.
Its strange how labels change,
eighteen years ago they were tagged
onto the end the Manchester thing,
now their part of 'The Kids',
interesting.
The real reason for coming was
without a question, The Jennifers.
They may have a combined age of
little more than sixty (there are four
of them) but they are so fine, so
delicate and yet so strong that I find
k.d. lang
-ingenue
Ukranians
-Ukranians LP
k.d. lang, so soft, so mellow, that
you can feel the after eight mints
being passed round, and all the
people refusing that last slice of
Vienneta, in the background lives
katharine d. lang, fighting a one
woman battle against capital letters.
And now, as the curtains billow in
the wind, we rise away from the
dinner party, passing through a
French-English dictionary in a vain
attempt to discover what an
'Ingenue' actually is. The editor
says it's an engineer, so there.
In summation, then, k.d. lang is
ideal music to revise to. It won't
distract you in the slightest.

• The album, and the single
'Constant Craving' are outnow.
k.d. lang plays the Hammersmith
Odeon, May 8,9.
Winner of the coveted 'most
peculiar piece of music in the Felix
Office' for April 1992. The
trophy's in the post. It's nothing like
the Wedding Present, in case
anyone was wondering. In fact it's
quite tuneful, but I can't really see
any major league appeal for
Ukranian music anywhere apart
from Kiev.

Cooking Vinyl/BMG. and they play

two singles, and then 'Policemen',
and 'Fair Blows the Wind for
France', the best track on the album
by far, but then, at the end of the
first side, ,it seems to go a bit
downhill. The other side picks up
a bit, with the title track but there's
nothing much else of any real
interest on there. Shame really.
