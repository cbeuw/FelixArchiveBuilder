Election Complaint
Dear Adam,
In the recent Sabbatical Elections,
many of the rules laid down by the
election committee were broken by
candidates. One candidate did not
include hustings information on his
posters, leaflets were widely used
as posters and one candidate went
over budget. It seems that the
committee will not take action
against such offences unless a
complaint is made by another
candidate.
In particular I am angry that Toby
Jones was put in the position of
having to choose whether to
Au Secours!
Dear Sir,
I am a second year student in the
college 'Ecole Nationale Superiere
d'Arts et Metiers.' This college
instructs mechanical and general
engineers.
As the knowledge of English is
very important for my future work,
I would ask you, if you could find
among the students of your college,
someone who will be interested in
welcoming me during my vacation,
in return for money or an exchange.
I propose the period during the
summer holidays.
I would greatly appreciate your
consideration of my request, I shall
be glad to send you any additional
information.
Yours faithfully,
Christin Philippe (A307)

disqualify his opponent, Jonty
Beavan, for running over budget.
As there were only the two
candidates, disqualification of his
opponent would have meant Toby
would have only had to beat New
Election to win. He felt that
ordering a disqualification would
not be a proper way of winning and
would have produced bad feeling
with the members of Felix. I wish
to make it clear that I am not
arguing that Jonty should have been
disqualified—I wish him every luck
in the future. I simply feel that such
decisions shouldn't be left to the
candidates themselves to make.
Surely when there are specific
rules set out, it is the election
committee's job to see that they are
enforced, with automatic penalties.
Why bother having rules, if it is
optional whether they are to be
obeyed?

Editorialette
The only excuse I have for reducing
this editorial to haiku-like
proportions is that I felt I ought to
accomodate the E G M motions
opposite. I hope you find this useful
and will attend the E G M to voice
your opinion. Bear in mind the
consequences for you if the motions
are carried. Even though banks - or
more correctly their shareholders -
are money grabbing bastards, they
do help finance many student
activities and employ a percentage
of IC graduates.
I know that most of you will be
suffering exams in the next few
weeks - good luck, and try to keep
them in perspective. This means
that Felix may be rather thin in
future. If anybody would like to
help with news gathering in
particular, please come in to help
on Wednesday afternoon. I will be
the one running across the walls,
nibbling my nails and making
squeaking noises.
Through the gaping hole in the
ceiling of the disco prison shadowy
figures leapt down on to the dance
floor and the guitar stage. Sirens
wailed and emergency lights flashed
in the room. The prisoners thought
this was another dancing session
and began moving their bodies to
the danger signs. The armed
bouncers leapt forward to attack the
intruders but as they closed in on
the enemy and recognised their foes
they uttered a cry of dismay.
Oh no, not T H E S E terrorists!'
As the bouncers tried to close in
on the terrorists they found that the
enemy were now wearing bouncer
uniforms. As the bouncers stood
confused gas bombs went off
immersing the room in white
smoke. Laser lights flashed to the
staccato beat of bullets echoed
around the room as several
bouncers decided that hitting
anyone was better than hitting no
one. The lasers, smoke and rattling
bullets were inspiring the dancers
who jerked more frenetically to the
rhythm. Someone was shouting on
the loudhailer to try and organise
the prison guards. The excited
prisoners shouted back the words,
chorus style.
In the dense smoke figures
grabbed Stress the prone form of
Mercy Killing, propelling them
back towards the hole. As Stress
cowered down amid the fighting
and jiving a massive beating,
grinding sound filled the prison
sending the guards into fear and
trepidation and the dancers into
faster gyrations. The sound
increased until amid more smoke
and dust a tunnelling machine broke
through the floor. The terrorists
disengaged from the bouncers and
leapt through an open doorway in
the side of the machine. A final
explosion of noise and light rocked
the prison. Slowly the smoke
cleared revealing the stunned
guards and exhausted dancers.
While the bouncers cursed the
prisoners cheered-.-
G O O D SONG!!'
'Kill him!!'
Carefree, standing over the body
of her brother, Mercy, shouted it
out and spat at Stress. Held tightly
between two guards he stood in the
dark cold headquarters of the
terrorist unit. They had left the
tunelling machine shortly after
breaking out of the prison. After
running and crawling, mainly
downwards, they had arrived at this
dankroom, somewhere in the belly
of the lizard.
T don't think so.'
The terrorist leader appeared out
of the darkness.
'A L E P T O N ! ! '
Stress stumbled back in surprise.
Gliding into the light came an
androgynous figure; neither male,
female or robot. The figure had a
face covered in large round
mirrored glasses and long thick
hair. The body lay semi-reclined
partly immersed in cables and wires
which swept up to link with glasses

entity was clothed in black and
silver and looked very relaxed.
'Hello Stress.'
Stress broke free of his captors
and leapt forward to attack his
sworn enemy. The lepton casually
pointed his finger at Stress and
cocked his thumb. The finger spat
a bolt at Stress causing him to fall
backwards into the arms of his
guards. Stress felt the powerfull
mellowness bolt sending him
helplessly into relaxation. He
looked back at the lepton.
'What are you doing here?'
The lepton lazily smiled.
'I'm here to help you.'
'YOU?!'
'You want to get back at the inner
it
system, don't you? They've been
using and abusing you, haven't
they?'
'Yes.'
'Well I'm giving you a chance for
revenge. I have a mission for you.

and find out where the mechanism
is and how to activate it. You must
look for the scientist. Will you do
it?'
Stress paused. -
'Yes, I'll do it. On one condition
though.'
'What's that?'
'You'll remove the military
chemicals inside my body that keep
clouding my vision and prevent me
seeing what should be done. I don't
want to run headless anymore.'
The lepton grinned hugely.
'Are you sure?'
'Yes.'
'That's agreed then.'
