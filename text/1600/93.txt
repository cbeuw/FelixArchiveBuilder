ended 19-7, with RSM retaining the
Bottle for the 5th year running.
The Bottle Match is one of the
social and sporting highlights of
the year for both RSM and CSM
students, with an after party hosted
by the RSM in Metric. However,
supporters and players from both
institutions were warned that the
excesses of alcohol-fuelled behavior
that had marked previous Bottle

Matches would not be tolerated,
with Sammy the Bouncer in
attendance to keep everyone in line,
and dire threats of the cancellation
of future matches if the College and
Union were unhappy with students’
conduct throughout the day.
Fortunately, these fears proved
to be unfounded, as no serious
incidents of antisocial behavior of
injury occurred. One CSM student
had what was thought to be an
offensive weapon confiscated, but
on closer inspection this proved to
be a costume prop. Speaking to Felix
about College pressure to police the
behavior of supporters, who this
year included staff and alumni as
well as students, an anonymous
source within the RSMU said,
“hopefully next year they will get
off our case”.

What they said about the weekend
“Once again the Bottle proved to be a tough physical match.We had done
a lot of preparation for the day but we were naturally a little nervous due
to the history of the Bottle Match.Even after going behind in the first 20
and with 2 yellow cards I knew the RSM had the player quality to get the
job done.I’d like to thank the entire squad for the effort they put in; many
played through injuries and illness,toughing it out for the team.”
FREDDY WHITE, RSM RUGBY CAPTAIN
“Winning the Sharpley cup for the second time in as many years was a
huge moment for the RSM,since it was only the 3rd time in the recorded
history of the trophy (over 40 years) that the RSM have prevailed against a
historically much stronger CSM side.”
