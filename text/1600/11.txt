THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11

This House would accept an offer from Imperial
College London
We are all aware of
Imperial’s academic
reputation. I think the
academic benefits of attending
Imperial College London are not
disputed, so I will instead focus on
why I think the College is good for us,
and how the problems are just as bad
at other Universities. If we were not
at Imperial we would be at another
Russell Group University doing the
same hard degrees.
If we went anywhere else we would
be working just as hard, however
unlike at Imperial, most people
wouldn’t be. If half of your flat is
going out three nights a week while
you have to stay in doing work, that is
worse for you than if they’re all stuck
inside doing problem sheets, because
you don’t feel anti-social or lonely. In
fact, working at Imperial becomes a
social experience. No friend is better
than the one you make at 03:00 in the
library, because you have something
to bond over.
The other complaint I often hear is
how the College does not care about
its students.
Every University has this problem.
I have heard about things happening
at other Universities that I can’t
imagine happening at Imperial:
lecturers forbidding students from
asking questions, ridiculous rules on
transferring between courses. The
College may be ineffective but at least
it seems like it’s trying, and that’s a
damn sight better than most places.
Imperial actually stacks up quite
well against other Universities.
It is no more anti-student than
the likes of Manchester, and it’s in
a beautiful part of one of the most
amazing cities on Earth. The facilities
are excellent, and it’s full of brilliant
people doing amazing science. The
lecturers are as variable as anywhere
else, but at least here they know their
stuff, even if they’re not great at
explaining it.
I have met some of the most
interesting and enthusiastic people I
have ever met here. There is a genuine
sense of community here because we
all have so much in common: we’re
all nerds, we all love science. Imperial
allows us to occupy our weird niche
together and we will never get that
anywhere else.
Looking back it’s clear that the
17 year old me got four out my five
UCAS options completely wrong.
The one I definitely got right was
Imperial.
Forget ‘Education’ – what
matters is your ability to
get a job, be well paid for it,
and what you go through to get it.
We’re told that Imperial is great
for this. That’s overstated. What’s
understated is the unnecessarily
laissez-faire process to get there.
87.8% employability? That’s inflated
by the huge Medic population, which,
thanks to the NHS, are gifted with
100% employability, both here and
at twenty of the other thirty medical
schools in the country. In other
words, if you’re not a Medic the figure
is lower, and if you are, you gained
nothing by coming here.
“Imperial grads get the highest
salary”. One word: banking. If you
came here with a genuine interest
in your subject, you can forget that
salary. Sorry. What do I say to those
who are looking to shuffle code
12 hours a day for Barclays? You
need free time to spend money, so
my advice is to find a contract that
includes some.
So the idea that ‘Imperial degrees
are harder to get but it’s worth it in
the end,’ quite frankly, dies a death.
Given that you don’t get anything
from your degree unless you pass,
it therefore seems futile to choose
somewhere that seems so willing to
drop you if you can’t keep up.
What about societies? Perhaps we
can have a great time along the way?
It’s great that there’s loads of variety,
but that doesn’t make a difference if
you only have time for one. But it’s
nice that you can aspire to the top
sporting societies who are welcoming
to Freshers, avoid blatant sexism, and
reject the “lad culture”. Oh wait...
And what do we pay for this?
Tuition may be capped, but rents sure
aren’t. Bear in mind that Queen Mary
students commuting from Stratford
pay on average 40% less rent that
you do commuting the same distance
from Hammersmith, and that’s
without leaving Central London.
So you pay loads, work hard, and
get a degree that is little better than
anywhere else. So if we could go back
to when we got our offr? This house
would not accept.
"Imperial
allows us to
occupy our
weird niche

and we
will never
get that
anywhere
else."
"you pay

hard, and

that is little
better than
anywhere
else."
