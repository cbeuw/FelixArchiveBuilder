Adisclaimer, before this
review goes any further. I
have extraordinarily strong
feelings and opinions about Arcadia.
I studied the text for A-Level, and
directed the show for DramSoc
in the summer of my first year of
university. It’s been a huge part of
my life for the past few years, and
it’s only fair to the English Touring
Theatre production that I make that
plain before passing comment on
their show.
Originally appearing in 1993,
Arcadia is easily Tom Stoppard’s
most popular play, if not one of
English literature’s most popular
plays – a claim acknowledged in
the programme notes for this latest
large-scale production, where it is
revealed that it came near the top
of their audience poll of future play
ideas. It’s an exquisitely composed
work set entirely in the large drawing
room of a country house, with scenes
transitioning between 1809 and 1993.
This single-set approach is usually
a cue for the set designer to go
overboard with extravagant designs
for the room and all its furniture,
and on first glance this production
appears to be no exception. A vast
wall occupies the upper third of
the stage, with enormous windows
looking out onto the gardens of
Sidley Park, home to the aristocratic
Coverly family. The room is large,
and the expansive table squatting
in the centre of the room does little
to cover the swathes of empty space
surrounding it – but that’s fine. The
room’s emptiness is explained away
by the script at one stage, and as the
play progresses the table (and by
extension the room) rapidly becomes
more cluttered and disorganised,
echoing one of the key themes of
the play. Unfortunately, no excuse
is given for what lies on the other
side of the aforementioned large
windows. The gardens are revealed
to simply be the rear wall of the
stage, in all its undisguised glory. No
painted backdrop, not even a black
tab. A grey wall, replete with cabling
and sockets. Whatever the reason
for this particular set choice, it’s not
exactly the most auspicious start to
proceedings, considering that the
house opens with the set (and the wall
beyond it) clearly visible to the entire
audience.
So far, so unimpressive. But having
heard the director Blanche McIntyre
speak about the play, expressing her
love for its complexity and how she
and the cast spent hours unpacking
all of the science behind it to ensure
they could fully convey the themes to
the audience, I’ve got a lot of goodwill
sitting in the tank, so I’ll let it slide.
Sadly, the first two scenes rather
quickly threaten to squander every
last drop of that goodwill. There are
some positive moments – the scene
change is nicely handled, with the
characters from past and present
crossing paths with each other on
stage, drawing attention to the
similarities between the two eras.
Some of the cast members are simply
stellar in their performances. Others,
less so.
Flora Montgomery deserves
particular praise as Hannah Jarvis.
In a role created by (and written for)
Felicity Kendal, she makes it her
own, perfectly capturing Hannah’s
blend of external Classicism and
internal Romanticism. In the past
scenes, Kirsty Besterman makes an
impact as Lady Croom. The role is
a treat for any actress, providing
ample opportunity to dominate the
stage, and Besterman runs riot with
it, taking full advantage of Croom’s
unwavering control of the scene. It’s
just a pity that neither actress really
gets decent sparring competition – at
least not to begin with.
There’s a weird sense of lethargy
permeating the opening scenes,
starting with an oddly subdued
Dakota Blue Richards as Thomasina,
the prodigal daughter of the house,
and spreading from there. At times,
it’s only the sheer joy of the script
that saves proceedings, with the jokes
themselves, if not their delivery,
prompting occasional outbursts of
laughter. There is some defence for
this, in that while the later scenes do a
lot of the heavy lifting for explaining
(relatively) complicated scientific
or mathematical principles, the
early scenes have to do a lot of the
groundwork for making those ideas
make sense in the context of the play
as well as – obviously – introducing
all the key players.
But that defence doesn’t
really stand up when an early
confrontation, traditionally the part
where the play springs to life after a
lengthy dialogue between Thomasina
and her tutor Septimus, fails to ignite.
Much of the comedy is lost, leaving
the script to fight for itself. To its
eternal credit, it succeeds, proving the
theory that it’s impossible to make
a bad show out of Arcadia. It’s just
possible to do Arcadia badly.
Another scene change later, and
I’m starting to have second thoughts
about this production. Is it just my
personal bias, the intrinsic “this
is how Arcadia should be done”
that comes from directing it, or
is something genuinely off with
this show? One glorious moment
of physical comedy a second later,
however, and suddenly I’m sold.
Everyone seems to wake up, and
everything speeds up enough to
revive the play’s flagging momentum.
Nakay Kpaka’s Ezra Chater, the
would-be poet, finally becomes
the incompetent, flouncing comic
relief he’s supposed to be. Faced
with a livelier companion than the
subdued Thomasina, Wilf Scolding’s
Septimus comes alive, revelling in
the Byronesque wit of his character.
Even the 1993 scene that follows
feels livelier, with Ria Zmitrowicz’s
effervescent Chloe Coverly standing
in stark contrast to her counterpart
from the past.
This recovery continues unimpeded
by the interval, making for a far more
competent second act, and meaning
the play feels like a much stronger
production overall than the early
moments would suggest. When the
cast settles, the majority find their
roles and hit the notes just right,
although there are enough miscast
roles to unbalance the show and
leave a distinctly wonky feeling. But
touring a show is always hard on any
cast, and hopefully with a few more
performances (in front of some very
different audiences) the whole cast
will find their feet and be able to hit
the ground running every night.
This production of Arcadia, then,
is very much a mixed bag. Gorgeous
yet un-intrusive lighting design,
minimalist (arguably to the point of
detriment) set design and adequate
sound design combine with a
masterful script and various calibres
of performance to produce something
ultimately watchable, and enjoyable,
albeit with some almost unbearable
low points. It’s the embodiment
of ‘hit and miss’, and at no point is
this more obvious than in the very
last moments. The play’s soaring
emotional crescendo, as Thomasina
and Septimus waltz in the past to
the strains of modern-day music, is
played perfectly and strikes exactly
the right tone – only to be undone by
the appearance of the other characters
in the background, looking on. It’s
an artistic decision that feels slightly
off, and undermines such an intimate
moment that was done so well. It’s a
huge shame, as the bum note of the
final moments can’t help but taint the
good work that came before. This isn’t
a bad production of Arcadia. It’s just
not a very exciting one.
"When the
case settles,
the majority
hit the notes
just right,
although
a wonky
feeling
remains"
