issues of, well, the last issue
Student elections open for voting
This year we see a lot of the big roles
uncontested, how do you guys feel about it?
Lol I was only gonna vote for the fit ones anyway
-Such_a_Lad_69
Eugh I for one could not give a shit. I got invited to
about 100 events for stupid elections of students who
are just doing it because they don’t want a normal
job, or their CV is shit. The less idiots clogging up my
news feed the better I say
-ThirdYearApathy
I know rite they shud get an internship or smth
instead lyk normal students have to
- GoldmanSacsMan
I’m not even gonna vote, fucking CGCU never does
anything decent like RCSU balls
-A_Screw_Loose
That’s coz there are no girls in CGCU so why would
you even bother going lol
-Touch_my_balls_PLEASE
I personally think it is appalling. Sabbaticals are paid
an extortionate amount to represent the student body,
and it is decisions like Acton and Teddington that are
made without student consultation, because in reality
the sabbs elected are too spineless to do anything
about it. Makes me sick
- Extra_OrdinaryCouncilMember
But this is the first time we could have a female
President in years thank fuck the patriarchy has been
pulled down a peg or two
-Feminist_and_shouting_about_it
Actually, I think you will find that a record number
of students have stood in these elections, more
than any other year. If you are trying to say student
engagement is low, then I have the figures that say
otherwise. You are wrong.
- Diego_UnionOverlord
Have elections even started?
-Wolfson_Suite_For_Lyf
Lol I guess it means I don’t have to actually
campaign. BELLO

Exclusive: We interview this year’s
DP ENIS candidate
One of the more unlikely
candidates in the election this
year,Don Ma,is running for
the newly created position of Deputy
President (Engagement of Naturally
Introverted Students),or DP ENIS.
The position was introduced last
year as a way to address the 43% of
the student body that fail to interact
with the Union but instead live in the
library.
The role of the DP ENIS is partially
to research and address why these
few nomadic dwellers never interact
with students outside of the library,
but also to actually go and visit these
students now and again,to make
sure they are washing and eating
correctly.
Don Ma has pledged to donate a
third of his salary to pay for washlets,
red bull and desk fans for these
neglected students,and his long-
term goal is to finally install air
conditioning across all study areas.
We spoke to Don Ma,to hear what
he thinks he can bring to the role.
Hangman: Hi Don,nice to meet
you! What made you excited over
DP ENIS?
DM: Well,as a previous library
dweller myself,I know what it can
be like to basically live within the
confines of the fifth floor of the
library.I know how distant everyone
else can seem when you trudge up
there at 9am,sit there for 14 hours
straight,and only leave your desk
to go and get some coffee from the
library café.
Now that hot drinks are allowed
in the library,you don’t even have
an excuse to sit outside on the
lawn for ten minutes or so; the only
reason we don’t have showers in the
library right now is because College
are scared students may move in
permanently.
H: But isn’t one of your manifesto
promises to actually put bunk beds
into the library,especially now they
are closing Weeks hall?
DM: That is very true.I think we
need to accept that Weeks is going
to close,but look for the best
alternatives,and for those students
who already spend most of their
time in the library,they might as well
be encouraged to move in full time.
Then those who live further out but
prefer studying in departments or
at home can move into the rooms
that those that now live in the library
used to occupy.It’s win-win.
H: If people are going to live in the
library,won’t that make it harder to
encourage the students to interact
with the Union?
DM: I think we need to accept the
inevitable,and think about moving
Union outlets to the library instead.
I remember a few years ago,
there was a competition to name
Metric,and most people wanted to
actually call it the Library,so there
is a demand there for a night club
that embodies the elements of the
library that students have become
accustomed to.
Some people say they tried to
name the nightclub after the Library
as a joke,but I feel that in reality
there is a deeper rooted attraction
to the building that we now need to
embrace,not fight.
Although saying that,one of my
points is to literally pay people to
go to Metric; people often do stuff if
they get money in return I’ve heard,
so it might be worth exploring that.
H: Do you think College need to
listen more attentively to students
about the library?
DM: I really do,and I feel that they
are too busy dilly dallying around
rent prices and hall demolitions to
realise that the main centre of all
student life is in fact the library,and
it should be treated as such.Why do
we only have one library café? Why
do we have 18 printers,24 scanners,
three lifts but no toilets?
These are the issues that these
neglected students face day in and
day out,yet all the other sabbs just
worry about storage space for clubs,
the price of pints and consultation
platforms or frameworks or
whatever.That is why this role is key;
it actually seems to care about the
issues that matter to students.
H: Naturally introverted students
are hard to engage with; they
can be quite shy.Do you have any
experience you can draw on to
ensure that this large demographic
gets the attention it deserves?
DM: I’ve learnt a lot about
introverted students during my
internship as a park ranger; they are
very similar to hedgehogs–they
like to hide away or curl up in a ball.
They are quite prickly too,and must
be handled carefully.I will approach
these students the same way I
handled the hedgehogs; wearing
gloves,offering up saucers of milk
and talking in hushed tones.I think
that way they will then be brave
enough to let me pet them–I mean,
talk to them–and I can ensure they
are all happy and healthy.
Thanks Don Ma,and good luck in
your campaign!
