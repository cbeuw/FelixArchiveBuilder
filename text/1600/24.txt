The expert himself, Sanchit
Sharma, introducing you to a world
that you definitely want to join
The Magical
World of RPGs
RPG is an arguably misleading
term, which stands for “Role-
Playing Game”. The reason
I say it is arguably misleading is
that there are very few games, both
tabletop and otherwise, in which the
player does not take on a role. Yet the
term roleplaying game nevertheless
has a very precise definition. An RPG
is, specifically, a game in which the
player takes on the role of a specific
character and controls that character
through various encounters. Often,
the character is represented by various
numbers and statistics, but the key
part is that RPGs are about each player
controlling a single character.
Broadly, I split RPGs up into
three groups: cRPGs, MMOs, and
tabletop RPGs. cRPG is a term used
to mean computer RPG – that is, any
roleplaying game that is a video game.
In these, stats are very important
and you have a fixed goal to achieve.
Examples of cRPGs are Neverwinter
Nights, the Elder Scrolls series (of
which Skyrim is the latest), and the
Final Fantasy series. MMO stands for
Massively Multiplayer Online, and
MMORPGs are very similar to cRPGs
(technically being a subcategory of
them). But the difference is that where
the former are normally one player
and have a single storyline, the latter
focus on player interaction and often
have ever-changing storylines where
each player can have an impact on the
game world.
Tabletop RPGs are a completely
different beast. In a tabletop RPG, one
player takes on the role of the “Games
Master”, or GM, which is effectively
taking on the role of the computer
in the other types of RPGs. The GM
controls any characters not controlled
by the players, the world around them,
and sets the difficulty of tasks – it’s
not an easy job to do! Often, these
tasks have a randomisation element to
determine whether or not the player
succeeds. The simplest version is to
roll a die, add a number representing
the character’s ability, and compare
this to a number set by the GM
representing the difficulty of the task.
There are a few things you need
to do if you want to get started with
RPGs. You should be aware of the
role of the GM, and decide whether
or not you’d be willing to take that
role on (remember that a GM is an
arbitrator, not an opponent!), you
need to find people to play with, and
you’ve got to have an idea of what sort
of game you want to play. RPGs can
be split into three categories (as well as
combinations of them), and this can
really help narrow down what players
like in a game.
The first of the three categories
is ‘gamism’. In essence, these are
the RPGs where there is a strategic
choice to make in what you do – most
commonly in combat. Gamist RPGs
often have combat ‘minigames’,
which make up a decent chunk
of any given session. Rather than
encouraging a player to play true to
a character, games in this category
often encourage players to create
characters in an “optimal” way, which
don’t necessarily line up with choices
that make narrative sense, but instead
allow the character to perform better.
If you like to be able to ‘win’ an RPG,
gamism is for you.
Simulationist RPGs focus on
what would be realistic (within their
universe) in any given situation.
These are the games where you can
argue with your GM about the physics
involved in the scene and where they
might actually change their plans
based on what you say. Simulationist
games often have very large rulebooks,
as they have to account for a large
number of possible situations even
if they take place in very specific
settings. Don’t be put off by this – you
don’t need to read these books cover
to cover! If you want your RPG to be
realistic, simulationism is for you.
The final category is narrativism.
With narrativist RPGs, the plot is the
most important thing. Where gamist
characters often have optimal setups,
narrativist ones don’t – and people
who play narrative RPGs a lot might
even choose to create characters that
give them disadvantages relative to
everyone else (not in terms of stats,
but in terms of plot) because they find
it more fun to play games where their

“Gamist
RPGs are
where
there is a

choice to
make in
what you
do.”
