Voting opens midday, Friday 6th
If you would like to see your daily life
made easier then vote for me!
I have organised over 100 events
for more than 40 clubs as the
Dramsoc Technical Director, giving
me a unique insight into how a large
variety of societies run, and how to
make their high-value, high-risk
events run smoothly.
Having been treasurer to multiple
societies, I know how infuriating
Deputy President (Finance and Services)
simple Union tasks can be, so want
to change things to make it easier for
you.
I will make your annual budgeting
process easier so that you can get it
done faster and more easily predict
how much funding your society will
receive each year.
I will improve long-term club plans
by allowing you to save money across
multiple committees to make it easier
to purchase expensive equipment, or
build up reserve to draw on if you run
into problems in the future.
I will make your financial
transactions easier and quicker by
reducing the need for management
group approval so you don’t have to
wait for them.
I will make it easier for you to
book rooms by making the booking
schedule freely available so that you
know which rooms are free when.
Ali Lown
As Social Clubs Committee Chair, I’ve
overseen the development of over 60
highly varied clubs with a turnover
of almost £150,000. This has given
me insight into how the Union works
at the highest levels, and the skills
needed to manage large budgets and
groups of clubs.
I’m a physics student, Felix
contributor, and former chair of the
Sci-Fi Society. I’m running for DPCS
because I’ve benefited from all the
Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)

clubs I’ve joined, and I’d love to give
something back to make your time
at Imperial as great as mine has been.
In my four years here, I’ve gained
ideas for improving all clubs, societies
and projects. I’m passionate about
the Union, dedicated to its clubs, and
well-organised in managing projects
and emails.
Students generally see the Union as
a monolithic, opaque organisation.
Often, a club committee only
interacts with it when making claims
through the mysterious eActivities,
or when being nagged to attend
management group meetings. I
will ensure that every member of
every club enjoys a user-friendly
experience. The Union is here to serve
its members, and my door, inbox, and
Skype will always be open to you.
As DPCS, I will:
- Produce a definitive, up-to-date
guide to eActivities
Tom Rivlin
If you vote for me I will make your
interactions with the Union quicker
and easier, letting you get back to
socializing, running your clubs, or
whatever else you fancy doing to
avoid your degree!
Vote Chris Kaye for experience:
As a trustee of the Union this year,
I have been jointly responsible for a
charity with a turnover of £7m.
I lobbied to help level the playing
field for women, by successfully
reducing the cost of feminine hygiene
products in Shop Extra.
Working with the Commercial
Services team, I have championed
inclusive, non-alcohol focussed
Deputy President (Finance and Services)
events such as DRI.
Vote Chris Kaye for new ideas:
I will work to implement Gift Aid
on donations to the Union. This can
add up to 25% extra to donations
when received from taxpayers.
I will work to implement a donation
button for all clubs and societies
union webpages, so it is easier for
clubs to get donations direct from
alumni and benefactors.
I will review Union catering, and
lobby for fresh and improved pizza
bases made on-site at the Union.
I will continue the incumbent
DPFS’s work to lobby College for
greater transparency and fairness
in its fees and charges, such as
international bank transfer charges.
I am certain that my experience
coupled with my new ideas will bring
a positive impact to the Union and to
your student experience.
Christopher Kaye
If you like what you’ve heard, please
vote Chris Kaye for DPFS.
I’m Lizzie, a final year physicist. I’m
currently chair of Skating Society,
a role in which I’ve learned a lot
about how to budget for a society,
and the issues which societies face
with regards to money. I’ve also been
secretary of FemSoc for two years and
secretary of Skate Soc in the past two
years.. These societies have made my
time at Imperial immeasurably better
and I want all societies to be able to
Deputy President (Finance and Services)
run events that enrich students’ lives.
This is obviously easier when finances
can be managed easily and efficiently,
and that’s what I would be there to
help with!
As DPFS I would promise to:
- Make the process of applying
for tour budget clearer and easier,
and concentrate on maximising
the amount of money available to
societies.
- Make it easier for smaller societies
to utilise union spaces such as the
Union Bar and Metric. For many
societies the minimum spend is
unattainable, but they would like to
hold an event with a bar. I’m sure a
compromise could be found that suits
both parties financially.
- Maximise financial support to
campaigns. Student run campaigns
are an excellent idea, and can
make real change on issues that are
Elizabeth Campbell
important to IC students.
- Make sure that the bars remain a
pleasant space to meet with friends,
and a place where you would like to
spend time.
I’m mathematically literate,
love a good spreadsheet and most
importantly I really care about
the Union and want to help it run
smoothly.
