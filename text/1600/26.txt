How to live in an international flat
You’ve probably had a flat mate
who’s from a different culture.
For some of you, it might have
gone like this. Day one, things were
going well. Day seven, tensions began
with unwashed dishes. Day twenty-
five, both sides mobilized for war over
a party that had turned the corridor
into a disaster-ravaged scene.
When people from different
cultures live together, standards of
how to live clash head on. What’s OK
and not OK for each culture will be
tested and challenged, and everyone
will have to adjust. Eventually
someone will have to give in and
accept that’s the way things are going
to be. Settling on who’s going to do
that without making things blow up
is the tough part, especially when you
both started off as complete strangers.
Flat mates coming from the same
country would know that conflicting
habits are frustrating, to say the
least. I mean, some people are used
to ‘borrowing’ milk at home but if
you’ve been living alone for a while,
your stuff is your stuff. When these
two people meet, it can start off
irritating, but it can also make life
hell for the whole flat if they decide to
make it personal. We’re students; I’m
sure you’ve heard horror stories of
flats that have become warzones.
Now add cultural differences to
the mix. Wacky food smells, strange
condiments lurking around the
kitchen, language barriers, they add
whole new dimension of things you’ll
have to cope with. Worse, racial
stereotypes aren’t going to help with
understanding each other either.
Once you begin labelling another
person as ‘that typical anti-social
Asian’ or ‘that noisy Westerner’,
chances are they’ll stay that way for
the rest of your time together. You
might have just misunderstood then,
but more on that later.
Here are some of the ways to
smooth out the ride with your
international flat mates:
Address different
expectations
This is the easiest way to get to the
root of the problem. You’ll have to
remember that being from different
cultures means that you have
different assumptions about how
things are done. So sometimes, the
annoying neatness or messiness of
people can be a matter of culture.
For example, in Asian countries,
usually under the guidance of
demanding parents, dishes have to
be cleaned immediately and the table
can’t be messy when you’re done
using it. After being enforced enough
times to do that, it often becomes an
unspoken way of doing things. That’s
the origin story for the super-neat
Asian stereotype.
Meanwhile, the Western parenting
method is usually more laid back,
where cleaning up can be left
for tomorrow morning or later,
depending on the home. You can see
how the habit would clash against
how an international student has
been brought up.
Being brought up in Thailand
myself, I’ve been through some
adjusting. I used to live in a flat with
three other British students and I
remember how my flat mates would
soak dishes in soapy water for a
night before cleaning it up the next
day. Believe it or not, that’s the first
time I’ve seen someone soaking their
dishes. I thought they were just being
lazy; I didn’t even know that it was
the norm here until I asked them.
It doesn’t hurt to ask how things
are normally done where your flat
mate was originally from. Even if
they don’t change their behavior,
you can at least understand where
they’re coming from which would
make it more tolerable or even
change your thoughts. Without the
understanding, you’d probably think
that they’re doing it to piss you off,
easily making it a personal thing
rather than cultural.
There is no harm in asking!
As students from another culture are
probably used to their way of living,
they’d probably not notice that their
lifestyle is bothering anyone else.
In this case, a nudge and a friendly
reminder is usually enough to change
someone’s way of doing things. Much
better than muttering under your
breath and gossiping about ‘that
goddamn flat mate’, huh?
For example, I used to have some
sweet-smelling (opinions may vary)
green curry paste in the fridge. Of
course I didn’t notice it since no one
ever minded back at home. One day,
my flat mates told me that they’ve
been discussing among themselves
and decided to tell me that the curry
is stinking out the fridge. I was
mortified, apologized and quickly
bought some cling film to cover it up.
The curry’s sweet smell is now kept
all to myself. The problem is solved
painlessly.
No racial stereotyping
I’ve mentioned this briefly earlier in
the article. Why not? That’s because
it would leave the flat chilly for the
rest of your time there, widening
the chasm between you and the
international students you’ve
branded. There would be no chance
If you see this in your kitchen, you know there’s an international student (most likely Asian) living with you.

to come to a better understanding
and your flat mate will remain that
caricature for the rest of your time
there.
It’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy.
For example, if you think that your
flat mate is so anti-social that she
only hangs out with her international
friends, you’re probably going to ignore
her every time you see her around
the flat. Now to her perspective. If she
thinks that you’re giving her a cold
shoulder, she’d think that there’s no
one else she can hang out with apart
from her friends from home. See how
that works?
Granted, initially she might be a
bit shy. She might just be anxious in a
new country and faced with language
barriers, but that doesn’t mean she’s
anti-social and unfriendly. Give her a
chance and try socialising. She might
be relieved to find a friendly flat mate
that can help her settle into the new
country!
Living with people from overseas
isn’t always a pain as long as you’re
willing to reach a more understanding
position. It can also be more rewarding
than you thought. You can hear stories
from their hometown that you’d get to
hear nowhere else. And if you become
best mates, you can even get a chance to
visit their country and stay with them
too!
