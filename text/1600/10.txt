This House would create an unelected legislative
of science technocrats
The problem with our
Government is that good
suggestions, sensible ideas,
and reasonable policy are lost to
populism, the desperation for voter
buy-in and the lack of political
consensus.
Moreover, the Government is
stunted by apathy in wide swathes of
important issues, from green policy
to parts and segments of the financial
sectors: simply put, the voters care
about rising immigration levels and
the NHS, and our discussions about
sensible energy policy never happen.
What happens instead is
problematic.
Firstly, issues such as NHS funding
become highly polarised, with
disproportionate amounts of funding
going to certain, emotively appealing
sectors (such as cancer research),
leaving others (stroke and emergency
pathways) in the lurch.
Secondly, it becomes much easier
for politicians never to be challenged
on their more subtle policies,
especially in ‘unpopular’ legislative
areas.
Lastly, political parties are able
to make attractive sounding but
potentially economically terrible
pledges (“we’re going to fix all energy
prices” – sorry Labour, I love you,
but I don’t buy it).
These problems could be mitigated
by including a technocratic authority
in our parliament. These technocratic
bodies would be comprised of
respected scientists, selected from
a wide range of disciplines and
universities around the country.
Individuals on this body would
have to be knowledgeable about
the political system and would face
periodic review. They would be
allowed to veto policy and legislation,
as well as proposing their own
alternatives.
Coming from a wide range of
legitimate research, these bodies are
able to make decisions which are
grounded in research and evidence-
based methods. They can, therefore,
choose cost – and energy – efficient
strategies.
Furthermore, they are more able to
look into the nooks and crannies of
policy, while prioritising their areas
of research, instead of pandering to
solely political agendas.
This is especially effective for those
policies which get very little public
discussion.
In as much as each of these
scientists has an incentive to
maintain their own credibility, they
are self-regulating, and best placed to
understand highly technical policy
decisions.
Science is above politics. That
is not to say that the results
of science don’t have political
ramifications, but the results
themselves are true or false, whether
or not they affect the world.
For each of the issues we are
discuss – climate change, drug
policy or reproductive medicine –
it is important that the science is
deliberated in a setting with as little
interference as possible.
By giving an unelected body
of scientists power over people’s
lives, we irrevocably destroy the
impartiality of science. This takes
away the little influence that science
has in policy, by politicising scientific
fact.
Under the status quo, scientists act
as advisors, and can affect policy by
telling the government the correct
course of action. The government
can, of course, ignore this advice,
but the scientific community can
then publicly campaign against the
government. Voters can therefore
trust that scientists are not changing
the facts for political gain, and so
are unlikely to support politicians
who actively oppose the scientific
mainstream.
This balance of power is not true in
the US for many potential reasons,
but the effect is that science becomes
a topic for political debate. Politicians
have confidence to argue the scientific
case rather than the political. When
unelected scientists in the UK become
part of the political decision making
process, British politicians are forced
to engage on these kind of terms.
The public will now no longer see
the difference between the politics
and the science. When people
understand the political incentives
that could be affecting the decisions
of these technocrats, they no longer
trust in the scientific opinion.
People will not trust these scientists
on the science, whether or not they
have been politicised. Any doubt at all
will diminish support for things like
climate change from the ground up.
So overall we get a collapse of
support, and no political capital
within Parliament to engage with
impending threats like climate
change. But what about trust in
science?The day that people can no
longer support scientific endeavour
without doubt will precede the day
when science itself can no longer
progress. The backlash; funding cuts
and fear of political bias will continue
to destroy the scientific community
for as long as this technocratic body is
allowed to exist.
By doing this we would lose both
good policy and good science.
"they are
more able
to look
into the
nooks and
crannies
of policy...
instead of
pandering
to soley
political
agendas."
"funding
cuts and
fear of
political
bias will
continue to
destroy the
scientific
community"
