THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 45

gyrate, in the Nabil-directed video for
‘Two Weeks’.
In her most recent video for
‘Pendulum’, possibly the best track
off her stellar debut record LP1, twigs
is hung, nearly nude, from a set of
ropes braided from her own hair; a
world away from Fifty Shades of Grey,
the video is erotic, and sensual, and
just heartbreakingly beautiful. As she
slowly unties herself from the bonds
she has created, the camera glides
over her skin, taking in the grooves
and imprints caused by the tight
knots, until she is completely free, her
waist-length hair flying like a tribute
to liberation.
What sets twigs’ expression
of female sexuality apart from
her contemporaries is the fact
that her videos lack a sense of
aspirationalism; they stand on
their own, and are contextualised
by mental as opposed to material
desire. To make a comparison: in
Beyonce’s video for ‘Partition’, the
most overtly sexual piece from her
fifth album, and perhaps from her
entire oeuvre, we are shown a world
of consumerism and wealth. Sure,
Beyonce is expressing her sexuality,
allowing herself to be transformed
into an object of desire, but we are
also meant to covet other features
of the video: the manor house with
extensive grounds, through which a
limousine slowly prowls; the bowls
of fresh fruit at the breakfast table,
presumably arranged by the high-
fashion maid; the wide array of
luxurious lingerie, most of which is
encrusted with jewels. In ‘Partition’,
Beyonce explicitly presents us with an
array of objects that scream ‘wealth’,
and thereby implicitly makes a
direct connection between capitalist
and sexual desire. In contrast, twigs’
videos seem divorced from time and
space, instead presenting themselves
as mere fragments of her overactive
imagination; for her, the context for
the videos is her own mental space,
as opposed to anything that exists in
the physical realm. twigs allows us
the opportunity to look inside her
fantasy world, but not to inhabit it.
There is also a key difference in how
Sia and twigs place themselves within
their own songs: twigs takes herself
as the starting point, creating music
that seems as personal and specific as
someone’s diary, whereas Sia tends to
"Both

creative
control over
how they
present
themselves" FKA twigs' erotic video for Papi Pacify, from 2013's EP2, which saw her being strangled by a

– as her choice of presentation would
suggest – lose herself with a crowd. In
‘Big Girls Cry’, for instance, Sia speaks
about her experiences of loneliness
– “I come home/on my own...I may
cry ruining my make up...and I don’t
care if I don’t look pretty” – before
she bursts into the chorus, exclaiming
over crashing drums and icy synths
how “big girls cry when their hearts
are breaking”. She explicitly aligns
herself with a general group of people
who have gone through similar pain,
thereby allowing her song to strike
a chord with individuals whilst
maintaining a sense of generality.
twigs takes a different approach,
sticking – almost aggressively – to
the deeply personal. The nature of
her lyrics make it little surprise that
the most commonly used adjective to
describe her music is “intimate”. In
‘Pendulum’, for example, the lyrical
closeness is offset by the cavernous
spaces between beats, which allow
twigs to open up to herself, as she
confesses the extent to which she
yearns for another: “I’ve got time
but you’re tired of waiting/you only
want me in open spaces/come fill
your gaps with people/I know no-one”
she sighs, in a heartbreaking paean
to unfulfilled desire. Similarly, in
‘Lights On’, she achingly sings of her
fear of connections: “I shy away in
my mind/in hopes that I could share
this place with you...when I trust you
we can do it with the lights on”. Is
she exploring bodily insecurities she
experiences when becoming intimate?
Or is she despairing at her issues
with trust, her inability to reveal her
secrets to a confidant? Either way, she
is treating her music as a confessional,
bravely whispering her innermost
feelings into a microphone. Like Sia,
she manages to produce music that
connects with many, but looks inward
as a starting point.
While the two musicians may have
diametrically different approaches
to how they choose to present
themselves, what they have in
common is an unbending refusal to
allow themselves to become a pawn
in another’s game. They both have
complete creative control over how
they present themselves, something
that is rare for any woman, let
alone those in an industry that is as
obviously sexualised as the music
business. Speaking in 1982 about how
her record company had presented
her in the promotion of her debut LP
The Kick Inside, Kate Bush said: “The
media just promoted me as a female
body. It’s like I’ve had to prove that
I’m an artist in a female body”.
Sadly, it seems that little has
changed; women are still presumed
to be unable to create great music
without having a man behind
them, a fact lamented by musician-
extraordinaire Bjork in a recent
interview with Pitchfork.
It is therefore up to trailblazers
like Sia and twigs to try and change
things. Their approaches towards
what they do with their bodies and
their images are completely different,
but that’s ok; in a complex world that
is getting more and more convoluted
every day, it is not my place to say
which approach is better, or even to
try and suggest that there is a ‘better’
approach. All I can do is be thankful
that we have such artists, who will
go to any lengths maintain an
autonomous control over their image,
thereby protecting their creative
visions; it is these visions, these
vital, meaningful, unapologetically
confident visions, that we need most
right now.
