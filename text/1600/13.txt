ns... one last time?
the most respected,at the expense
of anyone else: it’s an obsession that
its students tend to pick up.
Mrs.Geek (yes,we’re still happily
together,holding hands as we
bitterly hate the world) still has
fondness for Imperial,mind you.She
reminds me that it still has lovely
people inside,and it still does great
things.She’s actually what spurred
me to write this anniversary piece,
because for all the hate I’ve built up
about this godforsaken University,I
am reminded that Felix was always
a place where good things had
the potential for happening.A lot
of talented people,working long
nights after all their degree work,
to do something creative and push
out entertainment for thousands
of students.Coming back to it now,
after a long hiatus,it’s heartening
to see the state of Felix Comment
today–full of pieces talking about
domestic violence,climate change
and denouncing GamerGate.It
makes me ashamed that I tried to
get cheap shock responses,but very
happy that there are good people
writing for such a great paper.
I’m also happy that many of these
new writers are angry.Anger,as I
eventually learned,can be a very
good thing.Imperial is an unjust
place,full of privileged bottom-
feeders who could not care less
about anyone else.More than this,
it is shaping a generation that will
run the world one day,pumping out
future politicians,business leaders,
scientists and policymakers.This is
happening in an environment where
rampant sexism is considered funny,
where the working class are talked
about as pathetic subhumans,and
where Islamophobia is treated as
acceptable japes.It’s tempting to be
reasonable,to talk and explain your
objections,or perhaps to simply
say nothing at all.Unfortunately
this often doesn’t send the correct
message,and in a place as set in
its ways as Imperial,it never will.
Getting angry,shouting loud and
passionately about things that aren’t
right,protesting and disrupting and
making yourself heard–this is what
people need.I hope there are lots of
angry geeks among you.
I’m sorry this column wasn’t
very angry on my behalf; I barely
invented any insulting similes.
I’ve not mellowed,but my anger
is displaced now: I’m angry at the
field I now work in,the companies
I interact with,the horrific diversity
problems that plagues every
organisation and event I go to see.
The world hasn’t gotten any less
ugly,and I haven’t gotten any less
angry,but unfortunately Felix’s
seventeenth century of issues isn’t
my time or place any more.I might
pop in from time to time,like now,
and I’ll always be reading from
a distance,but it’s time for new
people to take my place.To lash
out at everything wrong with this
University,this city,and the rest of
this planet.I hope you’ll be as angry
as I am,and I hope you’ll continue
to support Felix along the way–
keep the cat free,its claws sharp,
and firmly latched onto the nether
regions of everything wrong in the
world.Thanks,everyone.
"Anger, as I
eventually
learned,
can be a
very good
thing."
