ICSMSU is a fantastic asset to our
education. I want to make sure this
asset is kept as strong as ever and
continues to serve the needs of the
student body.
I have been on committees
throughout my four years at ICSM.
These have included RAG, Boat Club,
Rugby Club and ICSMSU as Clubs
and Societies Officer. I have learnt
a lot about the running of ICSMSU
from these. I don’t make promises I
ICSMSU President
can’t keep but you can expect high
commitment, communication and a
well run Students Union from me.
If elected these are the things I aim
to implement:
- Jenny Watson is doing an
incredible job in highlighting the
need for better funding for 5th
and
final year students. I will continue to
support this campaign.
- ICSMSU and the faculty
are continually looking for ways to
improve education at ICSM. I aim to
implement an essay competition to
hear your feedback and experiences.
- There has been a lot of
discussion over the use of The
Reynolds Bar. I aim to foster a
continuing open dialogue between
faculty, bar and the students about its
use.
- I aim to better publicise
the work the officers do and the
support the SU can offer you whilst at

Hi!
My name is James, a 3rd
year
Chemist running for RCSU President!
I have been on the RCSU committee
for the last two years, as Secretary
and current Treasurer and have
gained a great amount of experience
over this time. I have learnt a lot
about the workings of the RCSU as
well as where it can improve, and I
would love make these changes as
next year’s President. I am also the
RCSU President
current Rifle and Pistol Club Captain,
a role which requires a high degree of
responsibility and organisation due
to the nature of the club!
As President I would:
• Make the RCSU a
community driven by you, rather
than just an events organiser, creating
more opportunities for people to
offer feedback.
• Introduce workshops for
skills such as study techniques, stress
relief and more throughout the year
to cater for more aspects of student
welfare.
• Re-form some of the
RCSU’s sports clubs to give members
an opportunity to play casually as
well as trying to re-start inter-faculty
sports competitions. I would also look
into starting non-sports clubs where
there’s a demand!
• Introduce new events
including inter-departmental
Hi everyone!
I’m Andrew Olson, your current
CGCU Events Officer. This year
however I will be running for
president. I believe that I can make a
difference on how the CGCU is run,
and build on what Tim has done this
year. My three main aims for the
following year are:
-Increase the presence of the CGCU
on campus by organising more and
better events, with a great focus on a
CGCU President
good Welcome dinner and “casual”
events like the City and Guilds Week
and mince pie parties.
-Strengthen our relationship with
the other constituent unions (Royal
College of Science Union and Royal
School of Mines) by organising joint
events. Increasing the presence of the
CGCU in the Union, giving a stronger
voice to all engineers.
-Increase student support by
promoting welfare sessions as well as
working with societies and campaigns
that provide student support.
I bring experience and I´ll make
sure that every member of the CGCU
has a say in how things are run. I hope
I´ll have the pleasure of being your
president next year!
Cheers,
Andrew Olson

I am Dave and I am currently
the Faculty of Engineering
Representative for Undergraduates as
well as the Electrical and Electronic
Engineering Year Representative.
With the involvement and
opportunities I already have to obtain
feedback and seek a more holistic
education for all, I would like to run
for the CGCU President to improve
and lead CGCU. Having obtained
regular feedback time to time, I had
CGCU President
followed up every request thus far.
I think as a CGCU President, I can
definitely do more for our College
and I aspire to work harder to provide
better education for you and I.

Imperial.
- ICU has fantastic
opportunities that are often less well
advertised within ICSM such as the
volunteer recognition awards would
be well suited to our students who
offer their time so readily.
I look forward to answering any
questions at hustings
competitions and a Europe trip
(at last!) alongside delivering the
traditional events such as the seasonal
balls and bar nights, and expanding
the more popular events.
• Build on this year’s success
of Broadsheet and improve Science
Challenge, making it more accessible
and varied, whilst keeping its core
values.
Thank you for taking the time to
read this and don’t forget to vote! :)
