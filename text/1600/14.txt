Afresh cup of English Breakfast
tea is truly something to
behold. It is the liquid of the
Gods and the chosen tipple of this
great nation. Make no mistake; to sip
a piping hot mug of English breakfast
tea after a parched stretch is to know
true pleasure. In the last few years I
have picked up a few tips on how to
best prepare ones cuppa, regardless of
which type of breakfast tea you drink.
So, laid out before you is a handy cut
out ‘n’ keep guide to optimising your
brew, if you are interested.
Firstly, try your private best not to
add sugar. With sugar, tea is reduced
to a sweet solution not fit for man or
beast. To those of you who add sugar:
I used to be like you. But one fateful
day my mother helped me see the
matter in its proper light. She told
me “Try your tea without sugar for
a week and then make up your own
mind.” This maternal counsel wasn’t
just diplomatic; it was downright
wisdom. After only a few short days,
virtue had triumphed. I implore you
to try this for yourself.
Secondly, pour the boiling water
into the cup before the milk. Here I
am assuming that everyone puts the
tea bag in before anything else. Some
find that the addition of milk detracts
from the taste of their tea, but most
people are inclined to reduce the
strength and bitterness of their cuppa
with a modest splash of milk. When
it comes to adding milk, always do
so after you have poured the boiling
water, with the tea bag already in.
I cannot stress this point enough.
Tea, you see, is a dried herb. And in
order for tea to release its intrinsic
qualities, it requires to be infused.
This infusion will only occur if the
water is boiling when it hits the tea.
So if you put the milk in the cup first
you have removed all possibility of
genuine infusion, not to mention
that you will almost certainly pour
too much. It’s difficult to gauge these
things. As an aside, I would also
recommend using the least creamy
type of milk available in order to
prevent the tea from acquiring too
much of a sickly taste.
But for heaven’s sake pour the
boiling water in before the milk and
don’t add any sugar. Grasp only this,
and the time I’ve earnestly frittered
away on this article will have been
worthwhile.
So there you go, the perfect cup of
tea. Apart from everything else, what
could possibly be more important
than that? Don’t let anyone tell you
we don’t cover the big issues here at
Felix.

Gentle reader, I’m certain that
I am only the latest in a long
line of commentators to
compare two of the greatest influences
in our British lives: tea and sex. While
these might initially appear to have
as much in common as, say, fashion
sense and Islamic State, there’s a
great deal of common ground. Like
tea, sex can be enjoyed alone but is
best enjoyed in company. Sex can be
delightful when black, white or even
Chinese (do try them all!). Like tea,
things are surprisingly nice when they
get fruity (or even herbal...).
Now, gentle reader, you may
wonder why I am bringing this to
your attention. While, as scientists,
we know that symmetry suggests
common physical laws, in fact I wish
to use this to illustrate a problem
with a common habit in the tea-
drinking community. Readers, your
commenter is a purist. I enjoy my tea
with nothing added and I enjoy my
How do you like your tea?

sex similarly naked.
When someone proposes dunking
biscuits into my tea, I am aghast!
At first thought, to be sure, it
seems a happy convergence: are
two enjoyable things not more
enjoyable together? There are, alas,
less happy ramifications: chocolate
and the sweat inevitable to bedroom
activities are not happy bedfellows.
While it encourages licking, it diverts
attention and diminishes sensitivity.
In short, a chocolate digestive in my
tea is like chocolate body paint in my
bedroom - surprisingly sticky and an
inevitable source of brown mess.
I won’t pretend that I don’t like tea
and biscuits together, nor that I’d
kick someone out of bed for bringing
chocolate, but I think we can all agree
it’s better for everyone if the twain
never quite meet. Do us all a favour,
stop dunking – unless you’re prepared
to take responsibility for cleaning the
sheets (er, table).
