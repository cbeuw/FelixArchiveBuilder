The White Square — An LSD Rhapsody
Anonymous explores a secret operatic world previously out of reach
"I felt I

even more
so ... I was

"No detail

obvious."
Have I just made the stupidest
mistake of my life?” I
wondered as the white square
dissolved in my mouth and passed
down my throat. I reassured myself,
the whole thing was thought through
and the plan was bullet proof. I
stepped out of the bathroom and an
usher passed a few angry words in
my direction. I didn’t hear what she
said, but surely it wasn’t possible that
she knew? “The men’s toilets are over
there” she pointed.
Drugs are a taboo issue so I’ll
explain myself. Psychedelic drugs
alter perception and thought and
they’ve been used in spiritual and
religious settings for millennia. Some
of the oldest known cave paintings
depict, for example, the connection
between man and mushroom. A study
at John Hopkins reported that almost
everyone given psilocybin recounted
it as one of the most significant
experiences of their lives. These
compounds are also of great scientific
interest and are investigated for their
potential to break addictions and cure
depression, amongst other things.
However, outside of the therapeutic
setting, ‘recreational’ users are
interested in their power to enhance
emotion and facilitate connections in
thought.
Psychedelics are tools, and should
be used as such – I believe that before
using them, an experience should be
curated with a known trajectory and
predictable effects. For me, one of
the most powerful and intellectually
satisfying things I can do is to see an
opera, live. It seemed like a perfect
experiment: this opera, one I already
know and love and almost 6 hours
long, the same duration that the drug
has an effect. I felt I could make a
potent experience even more so, and
thought that I might be able to read
between the lines. I had read so much
about this work, I had played it on
the piano, analysed the score. But
now I was ready to really experience
this work of art. I made my way to
my seat, my bag was full of food and
drink for the long intervals. All that
was left for me to do was sit back and
enjoy.
Just as the overture crashed into
being, the drug started to take effect;
it was pure euphoria, and I was utterly
captivated as the orchestra segued
into the first scene. The people on
either side were forgotten, melting
away to leave only the action in front
of me. Everything that happened I
noticed, every glance and gesture
of the singers seemed momentous
and full of meaning. No detail of
the dense musical texture escaped
my attention and its relevance to
the stage action was obvious. At the
moments of greatest power, my knees
trembled and became weak. Before
I knew it, the first act was over but I
was still revelling in it.
As everyone made their way out to
the bar, I stood to let them pass. Was
I being awkward? It became hard to
tell, but I glanced at the note I had left
myself on my hand — ‘nobody knows
or cares’. It was helpful to remember
that no one pays attention to anyone
else, and as I looked out into the stalls
I was amused by the behaviour of
some people – “if that guy can get
away with doing that then I can get
away with a lot more”. I sat patiently
cuttings of conversation falling
onto my ears. I was overwhelmingly
curious but I stayed put. “Shit” – over
there, “do I know that person? Is he
looking my way?” I tried to look busy
and wrote some notes to myself about
the opera.
People filtered back into the
auditorium and the second act began.
On stage were two houses; a village
scene. Beautiful floral patterns
seemed to me projected onto the
roofs, swirling and dancing, but
actually painted, motionless. “Relax”,
I thought, “Enjoy what you’re seeing”.
The plot wound its way onwards,
twisting through its tensions
– people all wanting the same
thing, or wanting different things
and opposing one another. “The
Hegelian dialectic manifests itself
in everything!!!”, I scribbled in the
next interval. For the first time
since learning about the dialectic in
philosophy I understood it; it actually
made sense to me.
The opera was funny as well and
laughter was a great feeling, of almost
absolute freedom and joy. With the
chuckle of the man next to me, I felt
as if we were sharing something great.
The act was over too soon and the
next interval, 40 minutes long, was
rife with potential dangers.
I waited until everyone had left and
finished my maddened philosophical
analyses. I looked around me. I was
tripping now, hard, and the shapeless
interval stretched out before me as
an abyss.
I walked to the bar but there was
nowhere to sit so I stood, painfully
awkward. I returned to my seat to
tuck into the chocolates and drinks
I had brought. I didn’t feel hungry –
but surely my body would be? – it was
difficult to tell, but the timing seemed
right, and besides, the chocolate
tasted good.
A man sat down beside me, I tried
to continue looking around, but the
inevitable happened and he spoke….
It surprised me how freely I took part
in his conversation. As I watched him
prattle on I felt detached but the right
responses simply flowed from my
mouth. I even fancied myself to be
witty at times.
As the third act started the man and
I wished each other a pleasant time.
I felt that the effect of the drug was
wearing off, although I wasn’t sure
at first. I didn’t mind. In fact, I was a
little relieved – the purgatory of the
interval was difficult enough so what
would I do when the opera finished?
Still, I was a small bit disappointed
that I might not feel the ecstasy of
the finale as I had the overture. As a
way was found to a happy conclusion,
I simply enjoyed it as I usually do.
I couldn’t help but feel that there
were some secrets, previously in
reach, that were now being kept from
me. It was frustrating – so much of
the experience was wasted on those
interminable stretches of interval,
but every other moment was pure
magic.
I reminded myself – it was an
experiment after all.
