Imperial College researchers to crowdfund LSD
brain-imaging study
Scientists from the Department of
Medicine are reaching out to the
public in an attempt to source
the funding required to complete
the final phase of their research.
The study hopes to generate the first
ever images of the brain activity of a
person experiencing the effects of the
psychedelic drug.
LSD and other psychoactive
drugs such as psilocybin, the active
chemical in magic mushrooms,
have been the subject of a number of
recent studies in the UK and US. The
drugs are believed to have potential
benefits for patients suffering from
depression, anxiety and alcohol
addiction, but research into these
therapeutic properties previously
stalled after they were banned in the
UK in 1971.
The controlled status of LSD has
made clinical research difficult to
conduct, requiring a Home Office
license and approval from a research
ethics committee.
The first of its kind ever conducted,
the latest study hopes to investigate
the mechanism behind the way LSD
works in the brain.

Nutt, director of the
Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in
the Division of Brain Sciences, the
team has already completed the first
stage of the project. 20 volunteers
were injected with a moderate dose
of LSD before functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and
magnetoencephalography (MEG)
scans were performed.
The process of analysing the data
obtained has already begun, but the
full findings cannot be determined
until more funding is secured.
Funding bodies have historically
been cautious to provide grants for
research involving illegal drugs. The
scientists have turned to the start-
up science crowdfunding platform
Walacea in an attempt to raise the
£25,000 required to complete the
study.
Initial funding was provided by
Imperial College and the Beckley
Foundation’s Psychedelic Research
Programme, which conducts
pioneering work in understanding
the way psychoactive substances
operate in the brain, as well as their
therapeutic benefits. The same team
is running a study this May into
psilocybin and its potential to treat
patients with depression.
Recent research has suggested that
psilocybin suppresses activity in

New Dean of Medicine announced
Professor Gavin Screaton has
been named as Imperial College
London’s new Dean of the
Faculty of Medicine. He will take
over the role from Professor Dermot
Kelleher from 1st
March 2015.
Professor Screaton is currently
Vice Dean (Academic Development)
in the Faculty of Medicine. He first
joined Imperial in 2004 as the Chair
of Medicine, also serving as Head
of the Department of Medicine and
Campus Dean for Hammersmith
before taking up the position of Vice
Dean in 2013.
The Provost of Imperial College
London, Professor James Stirling,
made the announcement in a letter
addressed to staff and students.
“Since joining Imperial over a decade
ago, [Professor Screaton] has made
a significant contribution to the
success of the Faculty through his
leadership within a succession of
Campus, Departmental and Faculty
appointments.”
“Gavin is a passionate advocate
of the opportunities at Imperial
to improve health and wellbeing
by working in multi-disciplinary
collaborations across the College
and with partners externally. I look
forward very much to working with
him and his team to advance the
academic mission of Imperial College
London”.
Professor Screaton held a range
of clinical academic appointments
and fellowships at the University
of Oxford and the John Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford, before he joined
Imperial. As a clinical investigator,
his research focused on the
immunology of infectious disease,
particularly dengue virus infection.
As chair of the Faculty Board,
Professor Screaton has had a
significant role in staff recruitment
and strategic and financial planning
across the College’s Academic Health
Science Centre partnership with
Imperial College NHS Trust.
Professor Screaton stated: “I’m
honoured to be appointed Dean of
the Faculty of Medicine and would
like to thank Professor Kelleher for
his vision, energy and commitment
to advancing the Faculty’s aims and
ambitions, including those with new
national and international partners
and collaborators.”

“The Faculty of Medicine at
Imperial hosts an extraordinarily
talented body of staff and students.
It has been a great privilege to
work alongside colleagues from
all disciplines at Imperial, where
we combine our talents to educate
the clinicians of the future and use
our expertise in basic and clinical
science to change lives. I look forward
to working with my colleagues to
maximise the impact on health and
wellbeing that I believe the College
can bring to bear”.
certain areas of the brain which might
normally play a role in constraining
normal processing, enhancing
connectivity and communication
between different regions of the
brain. It is believed that LSD may
behave in a similar way.
“We think it’s essentially important
to understand how these drugs, that
are widely used and seem to have
this therapeutic potential, work in
the brain” said study coordinator Dr
Carhart-Harris. “Once we’ve done
that, we want to look at how these
drugs can be put to good use”.
Professor Nutt, speaking at a
briefing in London, spoke out
against the restrictive attitude of the
government to research involving
illicit substances. “Interesting
drugs that we’ve been researching
like MDMA (ecstasy) and LSD are
relatively low in terms of harms,
considerably less even than cannabis
and very much less than alcohol. But
no research [has been] done on them.”
“Despite the incredible potential
of this drug to further our
understanding of the brain, political
stigma has silenced research”. If the
team is successful in securing the
necessary funds, they may be able to
share the results of the study by the
end of this year. The crowdfunding
campaign will run for 45 days from
March 5th
on Walacea.com.
