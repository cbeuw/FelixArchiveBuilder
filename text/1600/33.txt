1982: E.T.
Steven Spielberg’s revolutionary
sci-fi film about everyone’s favourite
friendly alien from outer space is
a rousing crowd-pleaser. A sequel
wisely never happened.
1983: Scarface
The final shoot-out is one hell of an
intense sequence, and Al Pacino is
utterly gripping throughout. Also
added in the mix is the sizzling
Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first big role.
1984: Amadeus
Led by two assured performances
from F. Murray Abraham and Tom
Hulce, this stunning period piece
packs in so much stylish substance
into its narrative.
1985: Back to the Future
The first of a franchise that sent
Michael J. Fox into superstardom
in the film industry, it is a funny,
inventive time-travel adventure that
has for sure stood the test of time.
1986: Stand By Me
There is great chemistry and a strong
sense of camaraderie between the
four young actors, which is why the
ending is an effortlessly nostalgic,
bittersweet one.
1987: The Princess Bride
Can you believe that good old Saul
Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) from
the TV series Homeland is the same
guy who made the “prepare to die”
speech? How time flies.
1988: Cinema Paradiso
A sweet, tender film about a boy’s
love for cinema, it brings pure joy
from start to finish following the life
of Toto, as the mischievous young lad
roams around his Italian village.
1989: When Harry Met Sally
Meg Ryan will forever be
remembered as that woman who
faked an orgasm so well in that diner
that spawned the line “I’ll have what
she’s having.”
1991: The Silence of the Lambs
Anthony Hopkins immortalised the
role of Hannibal Lecter, the non-
blinking, cannibalistic psychiatrist
toying with the police to help them
catch a serial killer.
1992: Unforgiven
Clint Eastwood directs the Western
of all Westerns, featuring an all-star
principal cast members, in a story
that sees a retired gunman coming
back for that one last job
1993: Schindler’s List
Painful to watch, but essential
viewing: Steven Spielberg’s harrowing
Holocaust drama is a difficult one to
beat in terms of the sheer power and
emotional resonance it gives off.
1994: Pulp Fiction
Also known as the film that revived
John Travolta’s struggling film career,
it also features the best, most iconic
work of actor Samuel L. Jackson, who
quotes the Bible like no other.
1995: Heat
The definition of an adrenaline-
pumping action cop thriller, we get Al
Pacino, Lieutenant Vincent Hanna of
the LAPD, chasing Robert De Niro,
career criminal Neil McCauley.
1996: Fargo
The Coen Brothers’ quirky, violent
black comedy sees a struggling car
salesman arrange his wife’s kidnap,
and a pregnant police chief heading
up a murder investigation.
1997: L.A. Confidential
A cleverly plotted film based on the
book of the same name, it features
three mismatched cops (Kevin
Spacey, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe)
investigating a series of killings.
1998: The Thin Red Line
Terrence Malick’s grand,
unexpectedly beautiful and
thought-provoking World War II
drama features a quiet, effective
performance from Jim Caviezel.
1999: American Beauty
It is in the closely observant,
carefully structured narrative that
Sam Mendes’ film pieces everything
together so successfully. Perfectly
cast, and smartly written.
2000: Requiem for a Dream
Darren Aronofsky’s gutsy, energetic
and unflinching directorial style piles
on the uncomfortable, gut-wrenching
images. One to watch if you are
thinking of dabbling in drugs.
1990: Dances with Wolves
A heart-felt, earnest story told with
stunning scenery and powerful
performances; this is generally what
is needed to win an Oscar, which
director/actor Kevin Costner did.
2001: Moulin Rouge!
Australian director Baz Luhrmann
reintroduced the musical film genre
for the 21st
Century with his flashy,
over-the-top extravaganza that is a
feast to the eyes and ears.
2002: Far From Heaven
Julianne Moore excels in this period
drama set in the beautifully shot
1950s, as she always does, in a role
that won her a whole bunch of awards
that should have included an Oscar.
2003: The Return of the King
A fitting finale for an epic fantasy
trilogy, Peter Jackson managed the
almost impossible and directed a
final chapter that tops the quality of
its predecessors.
2004: Million Dollar Baby
A hard-hitting boxing drama,
Eastwood is steady both in front of
and behind the cameras, and as his
leading lady Hilary Swank is terrific
as a determined female boxer.
2005: Crash
This layered, intelligent hyperlink
drama looking at various potential
racial issues in downton Los Angeles
was the rightful shock ‘Best Picture’
winner at the Oscars.
2006: Pan’s Labyrinth
The Spanish Civil War seen through
the eyes of a young girl who still
believes in the world of fairies and
monsters is a fascinating vision that
drifts in and out of the real world.
2007: No Country for Old Men
Javier Bardem makes a terrifying
villain despite his character’s odd
hairdo, in this Coen Brothers’ award-
winning, pulse-pounding crime
thriller.
2008: Slumdog Millionaire
It is every bit as dazzling and exciting
as you would expect, with director
Danny Boyle expertly juggling many
years’ worth of narrative, putting it
all together for one flawless film.
2009: Up in the Air
Director Jason Reitman’s most
accomplished, balanced film yet, this
is so much more than seeing George
Clooney obsess over his air mileage
and firing people for a living.
2010: The Social Network
The story of how Facebook came to be
involves complex characters, moral
dilemmas and tough legal battles over
ownership. Far superior to The King’s
Speech, which won the Oscar that year.
2011: The Artist
A black-and-white and silent film
that is truly worth your time, Michel
Hazanavicius impressed everyone
with his massively appealing picture
that no-one thought would work.
2012: Beasts of the Southern Wild
A relatively small, low-budget
film that is not to be ignored, it is
a vibrant, highly energetic indie,
much like its excellent young star,
Quvenzhane Wallis.
2013: 12 Years a Slave
An unflinching, brutally honest
look at one of the most horrendous
chapters of history, Chiwetel Ejiofor
is heart-breakingly good, as is the
stunning Lupita Nyong’o.
2014: Boyhood
So it ended up losing a lot of the key
awards to Birdman, but the legacy of
Richard Linklater’s ground-breaking
film will no doubt live on, as the
greatest coming-of-age story ever.
