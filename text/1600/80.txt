Voting opens midday, Friday 6th
Hi, I’m Shun Kobayashi, currently
in the second year of my physics
degree.
As a student trustee, I (and my
other trustees-elect) would be given a
great deal of responsibility regarding
the operation and compliance of the
Union. I aim to serve with integrity
and dedication in all areas, giving
particular thought to the future
strategic plans for the union.
Student Trustee Shun Kobayashi
The Trustee Board is the highest
governing body in the Union –
it defines the Union’s strategic
direction, ensures the Officer
Trustees and senior management are
held accountable for their actions
and finalises high-level decisions.
These could significantly impact
the Union for years to come, both
legally and financially, so to ensure
they are made transparently and with
students’ best interests at heart, we
need to be consulted and our voices
Student Trustee
heard; that is the role of Student
Trustee.
As the current RCSU President,
I represent 2900 students in the
Faculty of Natural Sciences at
various levels in the Union and
College, and the position has given
me the experience and confidence
in speaking out in the interests of
students in the RCSU.
I have direct insight into issues
students face as a result of being
a member of Union Council,
Education and Representation
Board, and Community and Welfare
Board. Additionally, Student Staff
Committees and Faculty Teaching
Committee meetings have allowed
me to voice student opinions to
College, understand problems from
College’s perspective and push for
transparency in College’s decisions.
Prior to RCSU President, I was
the Physics Society Treasurer; my
involvement in these committees has
given me a good understanding of
Serena Yuen
how the Union works at both a society
and Constituent Union level. My
experiences will provide the depth
and perspective to the student voice
that the Trustee Board desperately
needs, and help me be a reliable,
responsible and representative
Student Trustee.
Trust me to be your trustee; vote
Serena.
Hello everyone,
I am Davies from China. I am
currently Computing department
first year student representative. As
a member of union, I want to devote
myself to improve the union. So I
want to stand for Student Trustee. I
fully understand the role of Student
Trustee is to ensure that the Union
is meeting its aims and objectives,
sets the long term strategy, ensures
that the Union is using its financial
Student Trustee
resources correctly and is financially
viable and ultimately is acting within
the law.
I belive I would be a good Student
Trustee, vote for me please!
ps: I am also running for DocSoc
Treasurer & CGCU Welfare Officer,
please have a look and vote for me :)

I’m sorry.
I’m not here to make false promises.
I don’t want to brag about all the
experience I have. I am neither
infatuated with Tom Wheeler nor
interested in cultivating my CV. I’m
running as student trustee because as
a student body, we need help!
Currently, how involved do you feel
with ICU? Do you feel you have a say
in Union and College matters? Were
you consulted regarding the closure
Student Trustee
of Weeks Hall? What about the
move of ICSM sports facilities from
Teddington to Heston? You might
be thinking, so what? who cares? You
should, my friend!! There’s an absence
of communication, transparency &
accountability between our union,
the College, and its students - this is a
cause for concern.
Now, lets be frank, I’m not
playing the blame game here. I’m
highlighting the problem - We as
students, have a right to be involved
in College matters through a Union
which represents our interests. The
fact of the matter is, we haven’t.
Whilst this may hindered by those
individuals who claim to have no
interest in Union proceedings, here’s
the solution - Vote for somebody who
does.
Student Trustees represent YOU,
when you can’t be there. We fight
for your needs, voice your concerns
Zain Rizvi
and keep your interests at heart.
Very cheesy, very cliché and I’m sure
you’ve heard it all before, but I’m
confident that now is the time we
take action, rally together and make a
difference.
Vote for Zain, because as you may
have heard before:
#NoZainNoGain
