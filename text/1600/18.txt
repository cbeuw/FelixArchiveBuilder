Professor Robert Winston talks to James Bezer
about the vote to allow ‘three-parent babies’
“This does not threaten
the fabric of our society”
“This does not threaten the
fabric of our society in
any way whatsoever: it’s
an individual choice for someone
who’s watched a child die of a horrible
disease”.
For Robert Winston, a pioneer of
IVF and one of the country’s most
famous doctors, the recent decision
by the House of Lords to approve
the creation of babies using donated
mitochondria was an emotive one.
“Most children with Leigh’s
syndrome, for example, go floppy,
go blind, have fits, have steady brain
deterioration and die by the age of 2.
The few that survive will have muscle
weakness and muscular dystrophy
and blindness.
“The one thing worse than losing
your own child is losing your own
child after a hideous disease.”
Mitochondria are structures in
every cell that produce ATP, the
molecule that powers chemical
reactions within the body. Genetic
mutations, however, can cause
mitochondria to work ineffectively,
causing these severe illnesses.
In the new technique approved by
parliament, the nucleus of a fertilised
egg is removed and implanted in
the cytoplasm of a donor egg from a
healthy woman.
It’s been described in the media as
creating “three-parent babies”, but it’s
not a term Winston especially likes.
“When I’ve had a blood transfusion,
I got far more foreign DNA in
my body than any ‘three-parent
baby’ would have, so the name is
nonsense, obviously. Admittedly, it’s
permanent, but it’s a permanent cure,
unlike my blood transfusion, which
will only cure my anaemia for a few
weeks”.
The vote enjoyed broad support in
the Lords, passing with a majority of
232. The decision has been severely
criticised by the Catholic church,
however, and in the preceding
debate, several members criticised
the treatment for ethical and safety
reasons, as well as for the speed with
which the decision was being made.
Lord Winston was one of the most
vocal supporters of the treatment
in the debate, and was particularly
critical of those opposed on religious
grounds, and was keen to emphasise
the ethical principles that had
influenced his decision.
“I think that in a pluralistic,
democratic society, responsible
individuals should have their
autonomy respected, and I don’t
think it’s any business of parliament
to say: “yes, you should have this
treatment” or “no, you can’t have this
treatment”.
“My impression of the women
who want this treatment was that
they were requesting it because they
did not want to have a termination
of pregnancy, because they thought
this was morally wrong, so it seems
to me to be utterly wrong for a
parliamentarian who’s opposed to
abortion, for example, to get up and
impose their view about somebody,
who doesn’t want abortion either, but
actually wants something which is a
lesser injury, which is to get rid of the
damaged egg.
“The mitochondrial diseases that
affect child-bearing families are
actually pretty rare, so this regulation
would only apply to a few families.
“Essentially, I think there are
four principles we must consider
ethically: one is the respect for the
autonomy of the individual, who’s
requesting something, and that
means informed consent, so you
listen to their problems and you
explain the difficulties and the
dangers to them, and that you respect
their confidentially, which is quite
important, and you respect their
opinion. Now occasionally, of course,
it might be that, for example if I was a
religious Catholic, I might disagree, in
which case, the correct thing for me to
do would be to send them to another
doctor.
“This is not a diatribe against
Catholics. I deeply respect
Catholicism, but I think nonetheless,
it’s important that we don’t try and
impose our minority view. I’m a Jew,
and I wouldn’t dream of imposing
a Jewish view on someone with
mitochondrial disease. Actually
the Jewish view would be to treat
them, although I don’t think many
rabbi’s have really spoken about it
particularly.
“So the first thing is the autonomy,
the second thing is that it is
encumbered upon us to be beneficent,
to try to do good, and to my mind,
if you can prevent a child dying
horribly, and having a healthy life
in consequence, that’s beneficent.
The main thing is not to do harm, so
you’ve got to look at the side effects,
and after the extensive research done
in Newcastle, I’m fairly happy that
the chances of serious side effects are
much less than the benefits.
“Lastly is the issue of justice: what’s
the just solution for these people?
The just solution for them is to have
the treatment they think they need”.
Despite the vote, Winston says the
first baby born in the UK through
this method is still a long way off.
“What will now happen is that
any person who thinks that they
may have mitochondrial disease
and doesn’t want to watch their
baby die can apply to a unit that’s
prepared to do this treatment, and
this unit can then apply for a license
to the regulatory authority, the
HFEA (Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority).
“That authority will take into
account a whole range of things
including their expertise, the kind
of research they’ve done, the kind
of precautions they’ve taken and
they may or may not grant a license,
but it will probably be done on an
individual case by case basis.”
In the late 90s, Jacques Cohen and
his team in New Jersey developed a
similar technique to implant healthy
mitochondria into embryos. They
were trying to allow older mothers
who had struggled to conceive a
way to have healthy children. 17
babies were born, and while two had
chromosomal defects, this may have
been due to the age of the mother,
rather than the treatment.
Despite the early promising results,
mitochondrial replacement has been
banned outright by the US Food
and Drug Administration since
2002 because of safety and ethical
concerns.
“I don’t know whether it was the
right decision,” says Winston. “I
think since then there’s been a lot
more research into trying to do
nuclear replacement and spindle
replacement in human embryos. The
problem, of course, is that there isn’t
an animal model for mitochondrial
disease, so you can’t test this in a cow,
for example, and see whether it will
have an effect.
“One of the issues I think about
mitochondrial disease is that there
may be a nuclear DNA component,
so these people with mitochondrial
disease might not only have
mitochondrial mutations, but also
mutations in the DNA of the nucleus,
which you’re not treating. So it could
be that they may be still affected by
the disease, but less so.
“Of course there’s a risk of
something going wrong with any
