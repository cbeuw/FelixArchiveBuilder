THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 87
FELIX 06.03.2015
Aleading coach company has
been caught replacing their
windows with sugar-glass
in an attempt to make them more
breakable, it was revealed today.
The replacements appear to have
been part of a plan to ensnare unwary
student sports clubs, with any minor
impact on the sugar-glass windows
causing them to fracture.
According to leaked documents
seen by Hangman, the coach
company then planned to cover the
coaches in various alcoholic detritus,
such as empty bottles of port stashed
under the seats to “maximise the
damage-to-student ratio.”
The company would then demand
compensation for the cost of cleaning
and repairing the coaches from the
sports club, as well as “lost earnings”.
The money this brought in would
then be added to the insurance
claim, leaving the coach company
significantly better off, and the
unfortunate sports clubs out of
pocket and in disgrace.
It is believed the change was part
of an industry-wide insurance scam,
with several leading coach companies
apparently complicit in the scheme.
“We were all doing it,” said one
coach driver, who asked to remain
anonymous.“We’d all had enough of
those students having a good time
and being a bit noisy on our coaches,
so we decided to get our own back,
and make a bit of money on the side.”
Said another coach driver: “We
actively let students drink on our
buses now, to maximise the chances
of them leaning on the screen and
breaking it. Once it shatters, we
call their Union straight away, and
demand as much money as we
reckon they have.”
“Sometimes, we even contact
their student newspapers too, to
really drive up the student-hating
hype. That way we come across as
a the victim, and people are more
inclined to send us more money as
compensation.”
A police spokesman confirmed the
launch of Operation CoachGate 3.0
Rugby, an industry-wide investigation
into the practice.
They found illegal warehouses
developing the sugar glass, alongside
several hard drives filled with student
details and scanned copies of a old
Felix and Daily Mail articles. The
investigation continues, and so far
eight teams have been reimbursed.

This week, after forgetting
to donate a third of your
paycheck to charity like you
promised, you realize that
your rampant addiction to
vinyl PVC catsuits has left you
with considerably less money
than you thought. You decide
to sell a kidney – luckily your
medic roommate has a black
market organ trade on the side.

I like to think someone will
someday look over these and
wonder about the writer and
what they’re doing. Nothing
constructive probably – I hope
to become president of Surrey
University so that when they
send rejection letters, it’ll read
“Surrey, you didn’t get a place”.
Might go to Uruguay a few
years. Looks nice on the TV.
This week in an attempt to
combat global warming you
decide to start pissing in
bottles, saving wasted water in
the toilets; however you fail
to take into account the sheer
amount you piss, amassing 5
gallons in the first day. You
bring a girl back to your room
forgetting the piss. Luckily
they enjoy a tad of watersports.
This week you decide to run
a paper that is 100 pages
long, but forget that you are
scheduled to have bronchitis
that week too. The days pass
in a strepsil-induced haze,
and it is only on Friday when
you realise you’ve actually
submitted 100 pages of love
poems, dedicated to an angry
Northern fresher.
This week you run ICTV’s
Meat the Candidates on; you
accidentally invite David
Cameron, and after seeing
there’s only one opponent he
shows up. Sporty Mcsports
drinks too much cider and
decides to fight Cameron on
live television, creating the
most sensational student TV
broadcast ever; 6 whole views!
This week you hit Metric
hard, inviting 100 of your
friends who say they live in
Beit in order to get in free.
When you return home you
apply for a union position and
subsequently win; however as a
middle class white Surrey boy,
your electorate don’t really
connect to you as black and
ethnic minorities officer.
This week you DJ for a friend’s
party, investing a large amount
in professional DJ equipment
(by which you mean stealing
it from IC radio). A problem
becomes apparent at the party
when you reveal your 70s
playlist – your compilation of
Rolf Harris, Gary Glitter, and
the Jim’ll Fix It theme doesn’t
exactly go down well.
This week you decide to do
a 24 hour radio broadcast to
feed Fen Bernando. After
caffeinating yourself to within
an inch of your life, developing
diarrhoea, you decide to shave
your head. People start to call
you egg head, and someone in
the JCR tries to dunk toast into
your skull. You look like a cute
Phil Mitchell though.
This week in celebration
of Felix’s 1600th
issue you
decide to go for it and be the
centerfold. Unfortunately you
don’t realize that the group
who’ve booked the slot is the
Alice Gast appreciation club,
leading to you being pictured
with a load of nude middle
aged women. Rumors spread
and your granny disowns you.
This week you decide to raise
funds with a bit of kidnapping
on the side; but after nabbing
your fluid mechanics lecturer
you realize the library locks its
printer drawers so you can’t
send a ransom note. Outlook
refuses to find the right person
to send it to, so you have to
use IC Secrets, after which the
police find you. Pint?
This week you campaign for
president; printing posters
with your face and some sort of
pop culture reference because
apparently that constitutes a
campaign, and forcing all your
friends to help. Then a rugby
captain makes a joke candidacy
for his penis and wins 68% of
the vote. At least Kris Kraye
will provide fresh pizza bases.
This week for the 1600th
issue
we finally complete the hotly
anticipated fishcake recipe:
Dip the cakes into the egg, then
press into the breadcrumbs all
over. Fry for 5 mins each side
until golden. Remove and serve
with lemon and watercress.
I know no one found these
funny but fuck you, I write the
horoscopes here, not you.
Industry-wise conspiracy
to make windows more
breakable to catch out
rich sports teams
There was complete apathy
in Imperial College today
as one of the candidates
running in this year’s Big Elections
revealed their motivations for
running were “I can’t be bothered
to find a job”.
In a tell-all interview with
Hangman, the candidate claimed
“it doesn’t look that hard, all you
do is sit on your arse all day and
pretend to be busy whenever a
student walks in.”
Hangman got things going by
asking if the candidate actually
had any experience that they felt
would make them a reasonable
candidate for the position. They
pointed us to their extensive
experience as the social secretary
for a popular sports team, citing
their many emails to the club’s
mailing list as proof of their
laddish credentials.
“I even got my emails published
in that rag the college publish, so
I’m totally internet famous now,”
they claimed.
When asked to specify which
club they were referring to, the
candidate laughed and muttered
something about “balls” before
refusing to answer any further
questions.
After much coaxing (and a few
pints), they were convinced to
continue. As the conversation
turned to their opinion on the Big
Elections, the candidate rapidly
became more animated.“It’s well
easy to get elected,” they roared.
“All you have to do is promise to
make eActivities faster and put
some waffle about transparency
and accountability. Everyone loves
that stuff.
“Plus it turns out I’m running
unopposed anyway, so who cares?
I could smash a window or shake
a small child and everyone would
still have to vote for me. Actually,
I might put ‘Shake a Small Child
Saturdays’ on my manifesto.”
‘Shake a Small Child Saturdays’
would in fact be only the
third point on the candidate’s
manifesto, which Hangman was
allowed an exclusive first look
at before publication. The first is
quite simply to “bring back Lad
culture”.
We ventured a suggestion
that this probably wasn’t a valid
manifesto point, so the candidate
promptly emptied their pint over
our head.
Lured back by the promise of yet
more pints and a free Tube ride
(clothing optional), the candidate
allowed Hangman to query why
no-one else ran for the position.
At this, the candidate just
chuckled and beckoned us closer.
“That’s totally my fault, actually,”
they revealed.“I just started a
rumour that Kris Kraye was going
to run for it, and everyone else
was too scared to challenge him. I
knew he wasn’t going to, because
he told me in the bar last night
after our twentieth pint that he
wanted to be DP (Money and
Swag).
“What a lad”.
