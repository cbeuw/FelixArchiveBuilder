Joshua Renken offers a
final retrospective on this
long-running medical
drama
House:
A Post-
Mortem
If you have never watched House,
I envy you. It is one of the most
nuanced and intelligent shows
ever created, and there are 177
episodes for you to enjoy for the first
time. In the eight years that House
ran (2004-2012) it was distributed to
over 60 countries and at one point
had the highest worldwide viewing
figures of any television series. While
the idea of a new medical show
for Fox network originated with
Paul Attanasio, it was David Shore,
credited as creator, who conceived the
titular character that made the series
so captivating.
The series centres on the life of
Dr. Gregory House: a misanthrope if
ever there were one. House is a drug
addict who depends on Vicodin pills
to manage the pain caused by an
infarction in his quadriceps muscle
five years prior. His reputation as
something of a medical genius carries
weight at Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital, an institution
headed by Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa
Edelstein). Leading a team of elite
diagnosticians at PPTH, House takes
on the cases that other doctors have
not been able to solve, in an attempt
to “diagnose the undiagnosable.”
At the beginning of the show his
team consists of Dr. Chase (Jesse
Spencer), Dr. Foreman (Omar Epps)
and Dr. Cameron (Jennifer Morrison),
but the composition of his diagnostic
team undergoes several changes. This
chopping and changing of characters
kept the series fresh in the fifth and
sixth series, a point at which many
shows begin to think about finales.
But really this show is all about
House. The team primarily serve to
create talking points for our troubled
protagonist, who regularly probes
into their personal lives in an attempt
to understand his employees better;
very attentive when it comes to the
behaviour of his team, there is rarely
something he misses. House expends
a huge amount of energy avoiding his
responsibilities as a doctor, so he has
time spare to mull over the patient’s
condition (they work case-by-case),
gossip with Wilson about Cuddy and
investigate into the private lives of
his team. A stubborn and principled
man who thrives on conflict, he
believes that his employees will
work best in a chaotic environment
where they are constantly trying to
outdo one another. With each batch
of employees he quickly creates a
competitive environment and under
House’s tutelage his fellow physicians
learn to distrust what their patients
say. He encourages them to stand up
for what they believe and fight for
their ideas. The team bend the rules
if they feel that it is not in the best
interests of the patient and often
break into the patient’s home without
permission. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
House’s favourite mantra is
“everybody lies”.
Each week there is a new case, which
House typically solves after a few
erroneous diagnoses, but the team
screw up regularly enough to keep
you guessing. It is explained in the
pilot episode that House is one of the
best in the country at finding medical
‘zebras’ when other doctors are
looking for ‘horses’. He has a knack
for solving obscure medical puzzles
that most other doctors could not.
House is a series that regularly deals
with contentious issues including
rape, abortion, religion, faith, and
adultery. The momentum of the show
stems from the intriguing cases which
provide a bottomless source of ethical
dilemmas and thought provoking
topics for the characters to debate.
Dr. House frequently reaches
an epiphany when in entertaining
conversation with his confidant
and only friend Dr. James Wilson
(Robert Sean Leonard). Wilson is the
Head of Oncology at the hospital,
and acts as a sounding board for
House to bounce ideas off; in many
ways he is House’s conscience. House
relentlessly mocks Wilson for caring
so much about the people he treats,
in one episode knocking on Wilson’s
door and declaring, “I know you’re
in there. I can hear you caring.” It is
mentioned that Wilson has a Messiah
complex; if true, then in contrast
House has the Rubik’s complex. He
just wants to solve the puzzle. Highly
manipulative in his relationships,
House often tests those around him
to find their breaking points. He loves
to play mind games with Wilson, and
the duo often prank one another,
often escalating until Cuddy has to
intervene.
House is a deeply depressed
character with a very cynical outlook
on life; for all his existence he has
been an antisocial maverick genius
who struggles to connect with people.
With a penchant for medical puzzles,
playing the piano, Vicodin, alcohol,
and hookers, House is simultaneously
immature yet perceptive in his
conclusions about life. He reacts
on impulses and is only selectively
rational. He strongly believes that
people are purely self-interested,
that everybody lies, that religion is a
joke and that thoughts don’t matter.
Only actions. He thinks there is no
objective purpose to life and dismisses
the lives he saves. It is through his
solving of medical puzzles that he
attempts to find deeper meaning, but
he describes the lives he saves as “just
collateral damage.”
This series gets darker as House’s
behaviour becomes more extreme.
He is always unstable and the people
closest to him, Wilson and Cuddy,
are in constant fear that he will go
off the rails. They try to provide an
atmosphere where House is given
enough freedom to do his best work as
a doctor, but not so much that he kills
"House was
one of the
first series
to put an
anti-hero
as the main
protagonist"
