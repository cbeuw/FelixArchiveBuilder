Britain’s Greatest Living Playwright

Jack Steadman champions Tom Stoppard’s right to the title
"Quarks,
quasars,
big bangs,
black holes
- who gives
a shit?"
"No-one
out there
manages
quite the
same trick."
To call anyone “Britain’s greatest
living playwright” is a bold
claim. Competition for the title
is fierce, and ever-growing – a simple
glance at the work coming out of the
likes of the Royal Court shows the
strength of new talent.
But one name has been at the
forefront of British drama since his
debut play, first staged at the 1966
Fringe and promptly picked up and
produced at the Old Vic Theatre
(in its National Theatre days) in
London.
After Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are Dead!, a re-telling of the events of
Hamlet from the perspective of the
titular courtiers, mere bit-parts in the
original, was a storming success, Tom
Stoppard’s name was made virtually
overnight.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern was –
is – an intoxicating blend of dry wit,
sly re-purposing of existing plotlines,
and deep metaphysical conversations.
With such extensive discussions
dominating the play’s runtime, it
runs the risk of being too scientific
(if such a thing exists), of coming off
cold and inhuman, but somehow
manages to sidestep it all. There’s
a heart pulsing beneath the play,
and it occasionally rears its head in
beautifully eloquent fashion.
Just take Guildenstern’s final
speech:
“No…no…not for us, not like that.
Dying is not romantic, and death is
not a game which will soon be over.
Death is not anything… death is not.
It’s the absence of presence, nothing
more. The endless time of never
coming back. A gap you can’t see, and
when the wind blows through it, it
makes no sound…”
That blend of eloquence and
emotion, warmth and wit is a
continuing trend throughout
Stoppard’s works.
The balance varies from play to
play – early play Jumpers (another Old
Vic production in 1972) is designed
as a farce, and bears the comedy to
match, but also wields philosophical
discussions over morality (“what’s so
good about Good?”).
Travesties, which followed two years
later courtesy of the RSC, tells the
tale of a production of The Importance
of Being Earnest in Zurich during
the First World War, featuring
an eclectic cast of characters that
includes James Joyce, Lenin and Dada
founder Tristan Tzara. With roots
in realities, Travesties ends up being
an examination of art and war, albeit
one riddled with puns and ingenious
nods to the events of Earnest.
Stoppard’s trend of producing a
play every year or two continued
from 1966 through to Hapgood in
1988, the first play that really felt like
it failed to strike that balance between
science and emotion. Ostensibly a
piece of spy fiction, Hapgood deals
in quantum mechanics (not least
the uncertainty principle), and
doesn’t quite succeed in striking the
classical Stoppard notes. Critics (and
audiences) reacted negatively, and the
play never really took off.
A five-year theatrical silence
followed. Then along came Arcadia.
Set in an English country house,
Arcadia follows events in 1809
and 1993 in parallel, using the
interactions between its characters
to explore the very concept of the
past and how we perceive it, as well
as the likes of the second law of
thermodynamics, iterated algorithms
and the shift in gardening techniques
across the centuries.
It’s an impossibly complex
maelstrom of competing ideas,
plotted to the nth
degree, to the point
where throwaway lines are key plot
points. Yet, somehow, it never works
to the detriment of the play.
The sheer chaos of the play’s plot
simply serves to demonstrate its
larger themes, which the characters
themselves are more than happy to
vocalise. The conflict between science
and the humanities comes to the fore
more than once, with one character
spurning scientific progress with
the gem of a line “quarks, quasars,
big bangs, black holes – who gives a
shit?” before going on to remark that
“I’d push the lot of you [scientists]
over a cliff myself. Except the one in
a wheelchair, I’d lose the sympathy
vote before people had time to think
it through.” A serious conversation,
veiled in comedic insults. Stoppard
was back on form.
Arcadia still stands as what is, most
likely, Stoppard’s greatest work,
but that’s not for lack of trying in
the years since. 1997’s The Invention
of Love, based on the life of A. E.
Housman (the poet), was equally
well acclaimed, while Stoppard’s
reputation outside the theatre was
cemented for eternity when he won
an Academy Award for his screenplay
with Marc Norman for Shakespeare
in Love.
2002 saw a trilogy of plays, The
Coast of Utopia, split into Voyage,
Shipwreck, and Salvage, and dealing
with events in late 19th
century Russia.
Running nine hours in total, the three
plays opened in quick succession in
the National Theatre, winning a Tony
Award after their Broadway debut
four years later.
At the same time as The Coast
of Utopia was earning its Tony,
Stoppard’s next play was opening at
the Royal Court. Rock ‘n’ Roll was one
of Stoppard’s more political plays,
dealing with the socialist movement
in Czechoslovakia under the Soviet
Union, and rock and roll’s part in that
movement.
The idea of dissidence through art,
specifically against the Communist
Party of Czechoslovakia, was one
Stoppard dipped into from time
to time, although Rock ‘n’ Roll is
arguably his largest work to tackle it.
It’s here worth noting that Stoppard
is Czech by birth, although his
parents fled the country when he was
two during the Nazi invasion.
After Rock ‘n’ Roll, the plays
stopped.
The non-theatrical work
continues to pour out, however,
with screenplays for the television
adaptation of Ford Madox Ford’s
Parade’s End and the film version of
Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, as well as the
radio play Darkside (another entry in
a long list of Stoppard’s radio plays).
Then came the announcement of
a new Stoppard for 2015 – The Hard
Problem – which promised to wander
into the realms of consciousness. In
interviews, Stoppard revealed that the
subject had been a long time coming
– “I don’t use a computer, so I take
lots of [newspaper] clippings. Some of
the oldest ones date back to the 80s.”
He also, being Stoppard, couldn’t
avoid some typical wit. When asked
why he waited so long to publish the
play, he remarked “I didn’t wait, I
procrastinated.”
The Hard Problem shares many
traits with Stoppard’s earlier works,
not least its delightful blending of
highly technical discussions with
deft humour and emotion, but
also marks a slight shift away. The
scenes are shorter, and the play runs
through with no interval. It’s all got
faster, more reminiscent of a film –
maybe Stoppard’s screenplay work
has finally started to seep into his
theatrical ventures.
That’s not a criticism. Far from
it. Change is always exciting, and
Stoppard pulls off The Hard Problem
with aplomb. It’s another successful,
brilliant work in a list stretching back
decades.
Stoppard’s influence is undeniable
– a brief glance at plays such as The
Nether (currently in the West End)
proves that much – but there’s still
no-one out there who matches up.
No-one out there manages quick the
same trick. Maybe no-one ever will.
