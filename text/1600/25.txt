characters do badly. Additionally,
pure narrative games are sometimes
GMless (or GMful) – where the role
of GM is either not needed, is shared
by all players, or done by the game
itself using some sort of simple
algorithm. If you enjoy realising that
your character is not about to die,
but rather that events have conspired
to create a situation so horrific that
death would be greatly preferred (or
"If you like
making
stories),
narrativism
is for you."
"Welcome
to the
wonderful
world of
tabletop
RPGs!"
in general if you like making stories),
narrativism is for you.
Here are some examples of each of
the combinations of style, with a bit of
info on each one. Each RPG I mention
here is either widely available, or I
have access to it personally (if the
latter, feel free to contact me to
borrow my copy).
Pure Gamist: This is a difficult one
to place, because most RPGs that
are pure gamist are closer to board
games than RPGs. But the one that
I know of which fits this criteria is
Warhammer Quest – it is essentially
standard Dungeons and Dragons in
the Warhammer universe, but with
the focus on going into dungeons
and beating up monsters. It is also,
apparently, incredibly difficult to
progress. Sadly, Warhammer Quest is
now out of print, but the Dungeons and
Dragons (see below) board games often
give a similar feel, if you want to try
these out.
Pure Simulationist: The best
example of this is probably the
Battletech/Mechwarrior series of
RPGs, in which players take on
the role of mech pilots in the 31st
century. Another (arguable) example
is GURPS, the General Unified
Role Playing System, which makes
different abilities more or less
difficult to gain and thus involves
a lot of looking things up. The best
thing about GURPS is that the books
give such detailed setting-creation
information that it can be adapted to
any system.
Pure Narrative: This is my thing, so
I’ve got a few examples for you. Itras
By is my personal favourite, which is a
1920s surrealist game, but the system
is so neat and concise that it can be
adapted to any setting with very little
difficulty. Mystic Empyrean is your
standard sword and sorcery setting,
but the system prevents character
optimisation by giving other players
control over how your character
improves. The idea is for it to be based
on how you play. Finally, Fiasco is
a GMless game designed for single
sessions in which every character sets
up an elaborate plan to get their way,
and it all ends up in (you guessed it!)
a fiasco.
Gamist-Simulationist: The most
common is Dungeons and Dragons,
widely considered the first ever RPG.
It’s a standard swords and sorcery type
game. It is worth noting that the latest
iteration of this game is an attempt
to switch it to a Narrative-Gamist
RPG, which is an interesting change.
However, another popular game in
this category is the Warhammer 40k
series of RPGs (starting with Rogue
Trader), which take advantage of the
rich backstory of the Warhammer
universe to create a sci-fi compelling
universe for the players to explore.
Simulationist-Narrative: This is
a difficult combination to pull off.
Eoris is an example of this kind of
game, but it isn’t well executed. Whilst
it provides a rich and compelling
universe in which magic is consistent
with modern science, the rules are
messy and incomplete. There are
a lot of criticisms of the game and
most are valid – but it is nevertheless
a salvageable system. However, this
combination hasn’t yet been done well
as far as I am aware, and so I would
personally recommend that if you
like both simulationist and narrative
styles, pick one or the other (or play
single session games and switch
between the two).
Narrative-Gamist: A big example
is the FATE system, which combines
action-RPG combat with a heavy focus
on character development and plot.
It’s a very fluid system, but puts a lot
of stress on the GM relative to other
games. There is no fixed setting.
Now that you have an idea of what
kind of game you want to play, you
need to find people to play it with!
There are three major RPG groups
in Central London – Darksphere,
the London Indie RPG meetup, and
(of course), the Imperial Tabletop
Gaming society. Darksphere is a store
that takes about 20 minutes to get
to by tube. The focus in the store is
Magic: The Gathering, but they run
Dungeons and Dragons games every
wednesday evening. The Indie RPG
group meet up a few times a month
near London Bridge, and focus on
single session, narrative games.
They’re a great place to go if you enjoy
narrative games!
Finally, if you’re interested in
playing RPGs at Imperial, we run
single sessions on alternating Fridays
and Sundays. Send me an email for the
details.
And welcome to the wonderful
world of tabletop RPGs!
