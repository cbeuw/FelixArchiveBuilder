In a new and startling move to try
and increase student engagement,
Imperial College Union launched
a #MeatTheCandidates; a televised
session where students could come
and throw large chunks of animal
flesh at the candidates running for
sabbatical positions.
After recent surveying has shown
that many students actively loathe
those taking part in the elections,
the Union made a rash decision
to channel this anger towards
candidates directly, in an effort to
dispel it.
Students were offered buckets
containing steaks, chicken breasts,
chicken wings, pork chops, sides
of salmon and chicken nuggets.
Students attended in droves,
and took to flinging the food at
candidates after they were unable to
give suitable answers to questions
over their policy points.
There were several casualties of
the night. A Council Chair candidate
was struck down by a 9 oz steak after
admitting that he had never actually
been to a Union Council meeting. He
was left feeling raw and disillusioned,
and was unable to recover in time
before suffering a hailstorm of
chicken nuggets after also admitting
that he thought the Union Council
had the power to decrease pint
prices.
The student running for Deputy
President (Education) suffered from
several blows from a wrack of BBQ
ribs after stating they would reduce
the ratio of students to staff in
tutorials; many of the BBQ ribs were
actually thrown by overstretched
academics who don’t have the spare
time to teach more.
A student running for Deputy
President (Finance and Services) took
a flurry of chicken wings to the body
repeatedly after wanting to increase
money for clubs and societies,
but not knowing where this extra
money will come from. Someone
also threw part of a shepherd’s pie at
another DPFS candidate’s face, after
suggesting the Union could still do
away with entry fees.
Deputy President (Welfare) fared
considerably worse; after promising
to reform the personal tutor system,
someone threw a whole salmon at
her face, knocking her off a chair and
leaving a fishy grease stain down
her top. Said the student who threw
the fish: “You can’t teach academics
empathy”.
Presidential candidates suffered
worst; one took a heavy blow from
a whole turkey after stating that
they would ensure College wouldn’t
close Weeks hall. Their opponent
received the most painful attack of
the night, when they stated that they
would introduce a new consultation
framework, despite the current
one left untouched and unused for
months now.
It took two people to throw the hog
roast at the poor girl, and she was
knocked out cold before a stretcher
came to carry her away.
Despite many of the candidates
leaving feeling bruised, those who
came to throw the meat said they
were a lot happier with the elections
season, and also felt they had truly
engaged for the first time in years.
Said one final year student: “I’ve
never voted in the four years I’ve been
at Imperial, but for the first time ever
I feel I’ve been able to constructively
communicate my views to the Union
over the issues that matter to me.
Nothing says “student dissatisfaction
with student coursework deadlines”
like throwing a whole fish at a
sabbatical candidate.”
“Meat the Candidates” claims several casualties
