THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9

I’ve now spent four years studying
as an undergraduate at Imperial.
That feels like a long time – I
don’t really remember the anxious
teenager who arrived here in 2011,
who was unsure of how to organise
a weekly shop and do the laundry.
I seem to have regressed in my
organisation of chores, as my life
has filled up with report writing,
project work and the whole ‘clubs and
societies’ thing on which I sometimes
spend more time than my degree.
I’ve had a great time at Imperial.
It’s worked me hard, and caused me
stress near exams or when coursework
seems to just pile up on top of me.
It’s marked me down for the most
inauspicious of reasons, and some of
the lecturers need to be put back in
the 1980s from whence they came –
but after all that it’s served me well.
I think back to the worries I had
when I arrived, the horrors I’d heard
from people back home about coming
to London. It’ll be too expensive,
they’ll make you work too hard,
there won’t be any women, it will
be full of international students,
they’re all Oxbridge rejects – none of
those things have actually come to
fruition, certainly not as a problem.
People who go on about ‘the ratio’ are
probably boring so it’s an easy way to
find out if you’d want to keep talking
to them. It is expensive, but worth
it - Imperial’s bursary scheme does a
good job of helping those who need
it, and I’ve loved being able to make
friends with people who come from
completely different backgrounds to
me, all over the globe.
It’s bizarre to think how different
my life would be now if I had gone
to a different University. I could
so easily have not made the grades
and ended up at Southampton, or
had an offer from Cambridge and
been pressured into going there. The
people I know now would be carrying
on without me and I’d (hopefully) be
with a completely different group of
friends, who are now just strangers
to me.
But the biggest thing University
has taught me is that it’s about
the experience, not just the grade.
The difference between a physical
University and an online course is
the people. The academics and staff
who help me with my projects, the
members of the clubs I’ve been in
over the past four years, the lifelong
connections.
These are the things that are unique
to University and that Imperial
somehow manages to get so very
right. I learn so much more from
working with other people on a
project, whether on my course or as
part of a society, than I do from any
amount of time reading a textbook.

COMMENT WRITER
As we build up Imperial West,
move students to live in North Acton
and become more ruthless with what
we fund and how, we shouldn’t forget
this. We somehow need to get clubs
and societies available to North Acton
and Imperial West students. We need
to keep people working together, and
not create a two-tier Imperial. The
Union needs to play its role in that,
but also College needs to recognise
the importance of it and help it to
happen, or the students there will not
have the experience that they deserve.
You may or may not have seen
that Imperial Hub recently
ran a social action #Resolution
campaign. Well, a couple of weeks ago
we were all over campus asking people
to come up with a resolution for how
they will contribute to making the
world a better place in 2015. On the
Monday I was running a stall where,
in exchange for making a resolution,
we gave people a free cup of tea or
coffee.
One guy asked for some examples
of resolutions that he could make.
So I said: “Well it could be about
cutting your food waste, starting to do
some regular volunteering, learning
about inequality in Kensington
and Chelsea...,” which is where he
interrupted with a laugh. “What do
you mean inequality? Between the
millionaires and the billionaires?”
Now you might be thinking, he’s
right though, isn’t he? Doesn’t every
other car driving around this place
seem to be a Lamborghini? About a
year ago, before I got involved with
Imperial Hub, I probably would have
been nodding along with you.
Studying at Imperial, it is easy to
enter a bubble and not leave until
you graduate three years later, when
you will probably join a high-paid
graduate scheme in the City and enter
an even bigger bubble. However, once
you pop the Imperial bubble you’ll
quickly realise that your university is
situated in a Borough facing some of
the most serious challenges and social
inequalities in London.
On one hand you have 45% of
children living in poverty in the four
most Northern wards of the Borough,
on the other you have rows of empty
properties owned by millionaires.
The average income can go from
£13,500pa to £100,000pa as you
cross a road. There is a discrepancy of
eleven years in the life expectancy of
residents in the North and South of
the Borough. Enough facts? I could
keep listing them for quite a while.
I hope by now I’ve convinced you
that there is a problem that needs
to be addressed; if not, just google,
‘inequality in Kensington and
Chelsea’ for some further reading
material.
The fact is that as a University,
we’ve been given a home in a place
that we just aren’t giving enough back
to, a home that frankly deserves a
whole lot better than us.
How is it that so many young
people from all around the world,
with amazing skills and experiences,
FATIMA IFTIKHAR
IMPERIAL HUB PRESIDENT
have come, lived in, and left
Kensington and Chelsea, without even
knowing about the serious problems
that it faces? Students around the
world have proved over and over
again that they have such amazing
potential to make a difference in their
local communities, and I know that
Imperial isn’t any different, so why
isn’t it happening here?
Is it that students are not curious
enough about where they live?
Do they feel they have too high a
workload to lift their heads from?
Is the College not doing enough to
get students informed and involved;
there doesn’t seem to be much on the
website other than a rather outdated
page about volunteering? Or do
students just not know where to even
begin and get involved?
Whatever the reason, I think it’s
time for each and every one of us to
stand up, as individuals, and take
some responsibility. We all need to
take some time to think about how
we can use our time at University
to make a difference to our local
community. People say University
will be some of the best years of your
life, and this is your chance to make
them some of the most meaningful as
well, so don’t let it pass you by.
Goodbye Imperial, and thanks for having me
The Union and College need to keep working together for the future
Is there inequality in Kensington and Chelsea?
Fatima Iftikhar thinks it’s time that we get involved with our area
"What do
you mean
inequality?
Between the
millionaires
and the
billionaires?"
"Students
around the
world have
proved over
and over
again that
they have
such an
amazing
potential
to make a
difference"
