Fred Fyles takes us on a
tour through the history
of the early pioneers of
electronic music
Women.

Century
of Female
Electronica
Recently, an image has been
widely circulated on Twitter,
showing what the Reading/
Leeds 2015 lineup would look like
if all the male-only bands were
removed. Published by the music
blog Crack In The Road, it makes for
a grim indication of the modern
music industry; a wealth of band
names has instead become a sea of
vibrant yellow, like an garish alarm
warning us, “there is a problem”. This
year, 89.6% of the festival’s lineup
consists of solo men, or all-male
bands; remarkably, this isn’t actually
that bad – feminist organisation
female:pressure, a collective of
musicians and artists pushing for
equality, have stated that “nowadays,
a 10% proportion of female artists
can be considered above average”.
Although we are now 15 years into
the new millennium, it seems that
festival organisers, music promoters,
and – indeed – many arts journalists
are still stuck in the last century.
However, this isn’t seen as a
problem by Melvin Benn. Current
managing director of Festival
Republic, the UK music promoter
who organises Reading and Leeds
festivals, Benn has denied the idea
that music festivals have a problem
with women artists. “The idea that
female bands are sidelined is just not
there,” he said to Gigwise earlier this
year. “Gone are the days where a band
was four guys. It’s genuinely gone.”
And so why does his festival only
feature 3 women-only acts, out of a
lineup of nearly one hundred?
Many defenders of such practices
have argued that there is an inherent
problem with the genre of ‘rock’
as a whole, and festival promoters
can’t feature woman-lead guitar
music if there simply isn’t any.
Aside from the fact that there are
innumerable incredible women
guitarists working currently (Annie
Clark, anyone? Anna Calvi?), such
an argument just reminds me of
defences of Rockism, that mating call
of the NME journalist that strives
for ‘authenticity’, only insofar as
that translates to ‘white, straight
men with guitars’. In his seminal
critique of this industry bias, The Rap
Against Rockism, journalist Kelefa
Sanneh argued that Rockism actually
amounts to little more than an excuse
for sexism, racism, and homophobia.
“[Rockism] reduces Rock and Roll to
a caricature, then uses that caricature
as a weapon... could it really be a
coincidence that rockist complaints
often pit straight white men against
the rest of the world?”
When it comes to how the music
industry, I feel that Benn would
do well to listen to actual female
musicians, such as Icelandic artist
Bjork; in an interview with Pitchfork
earlier this year, the creative auteur
lamented the bias against women
within the industry, mentioning
multiple instances where her work
she had done was credited to male
producers. “I want to support young
girls who are in their 20s now. You’re
not just imagining things,” she said,
“Everything that a guy says once, you
have to say five times.”
Bjork, whose achievements are too
many to list but include 14 Grammy
Award nominations, a Cannes Film
Festival prize for Best Actress, and an
upcoming Museum of Modern Art
retrospective of her 30-year career,
has carved out a space for herself in a
genre that is, perhaps, most open to
gifted women wanting to make music
on their own terms: experimental
electronica. Although the genre’s
openness towards women may be
explained by the fact that anyone
with a laptop can produce music now,
the relationship between women and
electronica actually runs far deeper,
all the way back to the 19th
Century,
and Ada Lovelace.
Lovelace, often described as the
world’s first computer programmer,
worked on Charles Babbage’s
Analytical Engine; her notes describe
what is now known as the first
algorithm designed to be carried out
by a machine, and pointed out a flaw
in Babbage’s equations, making her
the world’s first debugger. Described
by Babbage as the “Enchantress of
Numbers”, she saw the potential
for computers to be used as a social,
collaborative tool, as opposed to
merely a means of calculation.
In her notes, she speculated that
computers may “compose elaborate

and scientific pieces of music of any
degree of complexity”, thereby also
affording her the title of the mother
of electronic music.
However, it wasn’t until a century
later that a woman composed a work
scored for electronic instruments;
Johanna Beyer, a German-American
composer who moved in circles with
other luminaries like Henry Cowell
and John Cage, premiered her work
The Music of the Spheres in 1938.
An atonal masterpiece, the work’s
ominous high-pitched drone seems
to precede the work of György Ligeti
in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space
Odyssey. In fact, Kubrick had a strong
relationship with the electronic
music scene, enlisting composer
Wendy Carlos to perform the scores
for two of his most popular films: A
Clockwork Orange and The Shining.
Carlos became well known for her
album Switched-On Bach; first released
in 1968, the album consisted of JS
Bach pieces performed on the then-
novel Moog synthesizer, and helped
contribute to a significant interest
in electronic music. It evidently
captured the public’s imagination,
becoming one of the first classical
music albums to sell over 500,000
copies and picking up three Grammy
Awards along the way.
The 1970s saw an explosion of
interest in electronic composition.
It was during this time that Laurie
Spiegel gained invaluable experience
in electronics, working for audio
synthesiser laboratories. Spiegel’s
work is beautifully intricate,
generated using complex algorithms,
and in 1977 her interpretation of
Johannes Kepler’s Harmonices Mundi
became the opening track of the
golden record sent off in the Voyager
spacecraft. In August 2012 Voyager I
passed into interstellar space, making
Spiegel one of the furthest reaching
composers in human history.
What all these women had in
common was a strong academic
background, something that is
understandable considering the
prohibitive cost of early synthesizers,
which meant that only large
institutions were able to afford them.
The fact that educational equality
did not enter into US public law until
the Women’s Educational Equity Act
was passed in 1974 only makes the
achievements of these composers all
the more impressive.
And it wasn’t only in America that
the relationship between women and
electronics was fruitful; in 1958, at the
request of composer Daphne Oram,
the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was
founded to provide compositions
and sound effects. Oram set up
on her own after less than a year,
establishing her own studio where she
perfected the ‘Oramics’ technique, in
which drawings on cellophane film
are translated into abstract electronic
compositions. Oram’s mantle would
be taken on by Delia Derbyshire,
who transferred to the Radiophonic
Workshop in 1962 and a year later
produced the iconic theme tune for
"What these
women
composers
had in
common
was a strong
academic
background"
