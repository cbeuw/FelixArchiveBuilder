Royal School of Mines wins the Bottle
Match for the fifth year in a row
but losing 6 and the match to a CSM
side featuring several players who
are allegedly no longer students.
RSM were also unlucky in the
netball, with a strong CSM team
featuring a particularly tall goal
attack pressing their advantage, and
the match ending a 72-22 loss of
RSM. Despite the scoreline the RSM
were vocal in support of the team,
with high hopes for the rest of Bottle
Match.
An early start on Saturday saw
a highly enthusiastic but not
particularly experienced RSM
womens hockey team take an
unfortunate loss despite a goal from
fresher Alice Tidwell. The team kept
their heads high and defended to the
end, but to no avail, with the match
Nick Farmer reports from Harlington, where RSM come from behind to retain
the bottle
ending 10-1 to CSM.
The mens hockey went better for
the RSM, who took an early 2-0
lead from an excellent aerial in
to the D from Rowan Hedgecock
tucked in behind the keeper by
Chris Thomas, followed by a flying
goal from Richard Price, assisted
by a well worked pass across goal by
Will Murray. Although CSM drew
level again by half time, the second
half saw RSM pull back ahead with
a spectacular reverse stick finish
from Murray before Anthony
Vaquero sealed the match, putting
the ball into the top of the net from
a dummy drag flick from Bottle
Match veteran Ben Bell. The match
ended 4-2, with RSM retaining (and
briefly losing in the Union) the
Sharpley Cup.
As in previous years, the football
was not particularly auspicious
for RSM, with the match ending
in a loss despite an enthusiastic
performance from an RSM team
who surprised CSM with a good
press at the start, and delivered a
much tighter game than reflected in
the the 3-0 scoreline.
The contest for the Bottle itself,
the rugby, started with a few
worrying moments for RSM, with
CSM taking an early lead. However,
RSM soon came to dominate the
game, under the leadership of top
Hollister model Freddy White, with
tries from David Nielsen-Scott, Ed
Durkin and James Cox. Despite a
solid effort from the CSM team, who
had two disallowed tries, the match
