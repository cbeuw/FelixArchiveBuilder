40 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
06.03.2015
ICTV’s output may have peaked with the release of High Hopes go to the Brit
Awards, a show in which two students snuck into the backstage area of the
Brits to harass Lionel Ritchie, Damon Albarn and some knob from the X-Factor,
but you may not have heard that they’ve also been putting out a load of short
films this year. Pete Brook takes us a few of the year’s highlights...
ICTV? In my West Basement?
It’s more likely than you think
The Archivist
So firstly, The Archivist, a short
dreamy thriller, and – full
admission – my own film. I
wrote the first draft about a year and
a half ago, we shot it March 2014, and
finished editing, colour grading and
sound mixing in October 2014. It was
first publicly shown as a part of the
London Short Film Festival in January
this year and sitting in the back
row of the Hackney Picturehouse
I felt like I was going to implode. I
don’t like watching my films with
an audience at the best of times but
this time was terrifying as every
other film in the programme had a
big budget for a short film, probably
in the order of thousands of pounds.
Mine didn’t have a budget and was
shot in the pre-redevelopment West
Beit basement and an abandoned
office kitchen we managed to sneak
into over a weekend.
The Archivist is a film that follows
a few days with a news video
archivist who, whilst ingesting old
footage, starts seeing himself in the
background of old spools of film. A
spectre of a reporter hangs over him
with a grudge and starts playing odd
mind games with him.
Without ICTV’s old decrepit studio
I’d have had no place to shoot, and
without the crew I was able to find we
wouldn’t have had the opportunity
in the first place. The three days
shooting was simultaneously the
most stressful and fun time I’ve had
here, and I’m really proud (probably
too proud) of what we all made
together.
