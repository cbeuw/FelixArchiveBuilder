The Imperial College School
of Medicine (ICSM) Student
Union’s RAG week made
over £10,000 earlier this term; an
incredible figure that pays testament
to the amount of work that went into
running the week.
ICSM RAG week kicked off with
their annual RAG Games, which took
place at the Reynolds Bar, Charing
Cross campus.
The games involved various
challenges students could volunteer
themselves to do, before the infamous
“FourSkins” head shaving session
took place later in the evening.
Second year students from four of
the Medicinal sports teams gallantly
offered up their hair in return for
donations, raising £3124 in total.
Several students are picked from
Hockey, Rugby, Water Polo and
Football and nominated for the
head shave, and students can donate
money towards individual students
– the student that has the highest
amount donated for them has to get
on stage and is shaved,
On Tuesday, they held a club night
at Kona Kai, Fulham, raising around
£400 from ticket sales. The Medics
RAG Valentine’s Ball, located at the
Phoenix Arts Club, Piccadilly, also
raised around £1250 in ticket sales.
Thursday saw the first ever “I’m a
Club Captain Get Me Out of Here!”
event take place at Reynolds too,
which featured Live bush tucker trials
as club captains competed to win
£100 for their club. Club Captains
from various Sports teams also put
together a one-hour special show
Medical Student Union RAG week
raises more than £10,000
Philippa Skett reports as the money is donated to local charity
that was screened on the night. Entry
fees from the door went towards the
growing RAG Week total, with £350
raised in total on the night.
Throughout the week clubs also got
involved; ICSM Jazz Band performed
at Chelsea and Westminster hospital,
whilst Music Soc, Light Opera, Dance
and Drama came together to put on
the Arts Revue 2015 show at the end
of the RAG Week, with all ticket
proceeds also going to RAG.
Felix spoke to ICSM RAG Treasurer
Rhys Smith, about the events they ran
and the money they raised.
He filled us in on how the week
went, and also the upcoming events
that students can still get involved
with.
RAG Dash took place last weekend,
as 162 students, plus the ISCMSU
committee, were let loose across
Amsterdam. Said Rhys: “The only
stress was really talking to people
who ran the hostels our students were
staying in, everything else went very
smoothly!”
However, the biggest event left
in the RAG calendar is the RAG
Fashion Show, which takes place
next week at Clapham Grand. The
show features clothes from local and
small designers, all donated to the
students taking part. The show sold
out its first batch of tickets within
minutes, although another 150 will
soon be released nearer the date. So
far around 300 seats have been sold
in total.
Rhys told us how so many
students come together to help
with the fashion show: “This is such
an inclusive event, with students
from a whole range of clubs taking
part. From sports students through
to those in arts and performance
societies, it attracts lots of support
from the entirety of the medical
student cohort.”
Rhys said about the week on the
whole: “The committee has become a
close knit family as we worked hard
planning and running these events.
“Everyone enjoyed themselves
and so many students said they had
had fun getting involved too, which
is great. We hope even more people
want to get involved next year as a
result!”
Said Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli,
ICSMSU President: “I am really proud
of the students at ICSM for getting
so involved in RAG. We doubled the
number of attendees to our annual
Dash, and we raised a huge amount
through our annual head shaving

fundraiser.
“Despite all the scrutiny the media
puts on students nowadays, it is
amazing to see everyone putting their
money forward for a great cause.”
ICSM RAG are donating the money
raised to COSMIC (Children of St
Mary’s Intensive Care), a local charity
that looks to support critically ill
children and their families who are
being treated at the local hospital
based in Paddington.
