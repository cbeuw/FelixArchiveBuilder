Plus-size fashion need not be boring and
Tessa Davey explores the beauty in fashion for the plus-size woman, and
items like dark stretchy t-shirts,as
though there was no market for
exciting clothes for fat girls.Any
plus-size girl can list the set of rules
that are ingrained in us by fashion
magazines and clothing stores:
“Nothing tight or body-hugging.
No crop tops.No loud colors.No
patterns.No horizontal stripes.”
This doesn’t leave much room for
imagination and experimentation,
leaving plus-size women no option
but to cover up,and hide their
bodies under swathes of dark
fabric.Why have larger women
traditionally been denied the
opportunity to express themselves
in this way?
Inspired by plus-size fashion
bloggers,many women have started
having the courage and confidence
to embrace fashion,and dress
more boldly.There is a huge body
positivity movement,helping larger
women who have always been
ashamed of their bodies to accept
themselves,and acknowledge that
they are worthy of nice clothes.
There is also opposition; many
people consider this acceptance to
be a promotion of obesity,or are
even simply offended by seeing
people proudly baring their rolls
of fat and cellulite.Somehow,the
world has been so conditioned to see
thin as attractive that it is actively
repulsed by anything different.With
movements to stop discrimination
of race,gender and disability,why is
it still seen as okay to look down on
the overweight? Why is the general
attitude of the fashion industry–
and the general public–that if you
are not thin,you don’t deserve to
have glamorous clothing; you don’t
deserve to stand out? Luckily,these
body positivity movements have
had an overwhelming response,and
millions of women all over the world
are starting to embrace their bodies
and show them off,instead of hiding
them away.
Over the last few years,the high
street has started to catch on to the
vast demand for more interesting
items,and many brands such as
Asos,New Look,and Forever 21
have launched ranges that allow
women to find the pieces that they
want to wear,and let them have the
freedom of choice of what to put on
their body.While the choice doesn’t
come close to that of“straight
fashion”(regular sizes),it’s getting
better every day,and there is much
less shame associated with buying
clothes in larger sizes.
But the world of high-end fashion
is lagging behind.There is still
discrimination among high-end
designers and retailers,and while
some are starting to welcome
plus-size women as customers
and models,the world of high-
end fashion largely remains an
unfriendly and inaccessible place for
Tess Munster, also known as Tess
Holliday, has recently become
the largest model ever to be
signed to a major modelling agency,
MiLK Model Management. Her
size being a UK 22-24, and 5’5”, she
describes herself as a “body-positive
activist”, and is most well known
for her #effyourbeautystandards
movement, created to encourage
larger women to accept and love
themselves.
Despite being bullied for her
appearance throughout her life, Tess
started plus-size modelling when
she left school. Now she is one of the
most famous plus-size models in
the world, with a huge following on
Instagram. However, she experiences
a vicious backlash on social media in
response to each post, which accuses
her of promoting an unhealthy
lifestyle. Throughout this, Tess is an
unfailingly positive presence on the
internet.
She regularly hosts events all
over the world to help women with
their personal body acceptance. She
was named one of the top plus-
size models in the world by Vogue
Italia; her career is spiralling wildly
upwards, making history.
Gabi Gregg has a fashion and style
blog, GabiFresh, which is based
on rejecting fashion’s “rules”. She
believes that people should reject the
idea of dressing for their body type.
After seeing the positive reaction to a
bikini photo she posted, she went on
to design a hugely successful range of
plus-size swimwear.

It’s safe to say that the
world of plus-size fashion
is rapidly accelerating at an
unprecedented rate.It’s not
difficult to see why.Over the last
few decades the average size of
women (and men) has increased,
and regardless of the reasons why
they’re getting larger,people still
need clothes.
So why is the fashion industry
playing catch-up now,after years
of swelling waistlines?
Historically,it has always been
very difficult to find fashionable
clothes in sizes above a UK 16.
Most high street stores didn’t
stock larger sizes,and those that
did only sold very plain,basic
