Over BUCS weekend at
the end of February, six
brave Imperial souls left
the comfort and warmth of their
London flats to compete in the
BUCS Smallbore Rifle Finals. After
a hearty Chinese takeaway dinner,
something of a team tradition, they
set off for Sheffield ready for the
upcoming two days of individual
and team shooting.
Smallbore is a rifle shooting
discipline that involves a small
calibre round (5mm wide by 20mm
long) fired over short distances
between 20-100 yards. Indoors it
is shot over 25 yards. Smallbore
shooting encapsulates the pure
marksmanship aspect of rifle
shooting, disregarding external
factors such as wind, weather and
lighting conditions, as well as the
use of a more controllable firearm
due to its reduced power. It is
the most popular rifle shooting
discipline owing to its simplicity
and accessibility, forgoing the need
of large outdoor ranges. For this
very reason, many fullbore rifle
shooters, those who shoot long
distances outdoors, frequently train
with smallbore shooting, especially
during winter.
After a few hiccups and delays
with some of the other teams
(*cough* ULU *cough*), shooting
got underway. The Imperial A team
led by Laura Stokes, emerged with
silver medals on their necks and
relief after such stiff competition.
This is the highest Imperial has
placed in our known competition
history, having come fifth the
previous year and fourth the
year before. A notable mention
was our illustrious club captain,
James Badman, who shot both the
best and worst score of the team,
88/100 and 99/100, over consecutive
rounds, showing that shooting is
just as much about mental stamina
as the physical stamina. There
were a few competitors from other
teams who felt the need to show off
their impressive rifles with extra
long barrel extensions, perhaps
to compensate for their lack of
skill. However that wasn’t the case
and the competition was tightly
matched. The point margin between
2nd place and 6th place was ten
points out of a maximum of 2400.
The team won second place by 1
point. To put that in perspective, if
one shot out of the forty by any of
our shooters was off the mark by an
extra half-millimetre, it would’ve
knocked the team down to bronze.
Gold ultimately went to
Southampton University, winners
of the title eight times out of
the past ten years, also the alma
mater of one of our best shooters,
postgraduate medic Lawrie
Greenfield, owner of the infamous
all-black “Darth Vader” rifle.
BUCS competitions are shot as
a league throughout the winter,
with the top teams and individual
shooters progress onto the finals.
Also worth mentioning is the fact
that the Imperial B team, led by
Goronwy Tawy, won first place in
the BUCS smallbore division 3
league bringing back gold medals
and further motivation to our
mostly fresher B team.
Imperial College Rifle and Pistol
Club is one of the oldest societies
at Imperial College, dating back
to before the merging of the
constituent colleges. As a club, we
offer every discipline of shooting
that is available in this country,
smallbore rifle, fullbore rifle, air
pistol and clay pigeon shooting,
most of which have corresponding
Olympic events. We cater to
ICRPC Smallbore A Team Photo: Rifle and Pistol
shooters of all levels, from those
who have never held a firearm
before to national level athletes. In
fact, our very own A team member,
Alex Taylor, is on the GB U19
fullbore rifle team competing in
South Africa this Easter. Our state
of the art facilities and helpful
community of shooters mean we’ve
consistently had over 150 members,
many of which start their lifelong
shooting passion with us. So if
you want to try something new,
something a bit different, why not
give it a shot?
