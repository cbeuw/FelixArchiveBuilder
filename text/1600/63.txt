It All Could Have Been So Beautiful
Joshua Jacobs is let down at the National Theatre’s new production
"I doubted
the
legitimacy
of the
characters
because
of the
confused
subtext"
"Norris’
direction
and Hare’s
adaptation
failed
the book,
the cast,
and the
audience"
Behind the Beautiful Forevers,
based on the non­fiction book
by Katherine Boo, and adapted
for the stage by David Hare, is
currently on at the National Theatre.
Hare’s adaptation is principally
mediocre, and does very little but
leave me wanting. Set in a slum
outside the Mumbai airport, the
play begins with a stage littered with
refuse, waiting to be collected, along
with a backdrop of crude temporary
buildings. Shane Zaz’s character
of Abdul Husain is anchored at
centre stage sorting rubbish, whilst
other young characters run around
collecting what they can, thus clearing
the stage. This scene foreshadowed
the tone of the first half of the play,
not only in that it shows the frenzied
nature of the characters’ lives, but
also the insincerity of the production,
which extends to the whole play.
Booming electronic Indian music
attempts to corroborate and
justify the pace of this scene, as the
characters frantically run to and fro
across the stage. However, the balance
of the music forcefully reminds the
audience that they are in a theatre,
and that the characters moving
around on stage are performing for
them, undermining any possible
immersion into the world in which
this play is set.
At points I doubted the legitimacy
of the characters; this was not due to
the actors ability, but instead because
of a confused subtext. The characters’
behaviour was not validated by
what they were saying, and instead
I felt like there was a collection
of ideas and context that filtered
down from the original book, via
the playwright and director – some
of them were coherent, some were
now confused, and others weren’t
present at all. If you are going to
adapt a book, and cannot recreate it
without losing some of the content,
we need to consider whether the play
can stand alone apart from the text.
It is important that references and
behaviours which become spurious
in the script and production are
removed, otherwise the play loses it’s
integrity and becomes confused, as
this play did – allusions were made to
internationalisation and the effect it
has on local communities, tolerance
of different religions, and disabilities
in India, but they were trivialised
by the illegitimacy of what else was
going on stage.
This is a major shame, as such issues
are current and highlight why the
book was successful. The comedy
within the play was inelegant and
childish, and thus distracted further
from any serious political discussions
that occurred on stage. If this was an
employment of Brechtian practices -
something I doubt - it only served to
make the experience less enjoyable,
and it was done in vain. Not only was
there no distinctive discussion, but
the audience were again overly aware
of being in a theatre.
The staging was ambitious: early
on in the play, masses of rubbish
fall from above the stage, to cover it
yet again, as it was in the first scene;
in the closing scene a character
performs a jump from scaffolding, to
highlight the risks that the characters
made to earn money; and the
most exceptional part of the whole
production was when lights and
sound flew a plane over the audiences
heads. Although the latter device was
exciting and by no means mediocre,
it only served as a counterpoint to
the rest of the play, and each event
just seemed like an attempt to wow
the audience. Although they were fun
to watch, it felt disjointed from the
bulk of the play. Further to the plane
flying over the audience, the lighting
was particularly clever, and effective
at creating different spaces on a large
open stage.
The set, which at points was
deconstructed and reconstructed, was
mostly based on a large turntable,
meaning the characters could walk
from one scene to the next without
leaving the audience’s sight. Aside
from the turntable, it felt gimmicky
and - like the majority of things
in the play - still couldn’t distract
from the flimsy script. I feel that
Rufus Norris’ direction and David
Hare’s adaptation failed the book,
the cast, and the audience, resulting
in a staging that could do little
but distract the audience from the
aforementioned failures – this play
is an excellent example of artistry
not correlating with size of budget. I
don’t, however, doubt the brilliance
of the book, and I would love to see
another adaptation of it, as I am
sure the stage could be an effective
medium through which to discuss the
topics involved and for telling such a
story. Rufus Norris is the incoming
Director of the National Theatre; I
hope this is an anomaly in his work,
and the bathos pervading this play
does not extend to his further work at
the theatre.
Behind The Beautiful Forevers is on at
the National Theatre’s Olivier Theatre,
until May 5th.
Tickets from £15.
