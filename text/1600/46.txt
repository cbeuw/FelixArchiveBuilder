Kunal Bhanot explores what the term ‘jazz’ really means to us today
Jazz: A Revolutionary Chapter In Music
Look up the word ‘jazz’ in the
dictionary and you come to
find a whole host of definitions
ranging from “a type of American
music with lively rhythms” to
“meaningless or foolish talk” or
indeed anything in between. If we
stick with the former definition, jazz
could be assumed to have its roots
in ragtime music, whereas with the
latter we are left to question whether
jazz should be confined to a sole
genre within the realms of music.
Some of us, for instance, imply that
‘jazzing’ something up is the process
of making it more interesting. Be
it in a musical sense or not, jazz
fundamentally reflects the art of
spontaneity, an art that gained
popularity at the beginning of the
20th
century.
This is not to say that master
improvisers did not exist in the 1800s:
quite the opposite in fact. The likes
of JS Bach were known to perform
encores lasting for hours with no
written music in sight. Come forward
100 years from this and you’d
still find the likes of Liszt altering
Chopin’s themes to his own liking,
albeit angering him in the process.
Based on our earlier definitions
we could therefore argue that jazz
has its roots in classical music even
though the improvisational art form
was hindered by the dominance of
compositional music at the time.
What is it then that has led us to
believe that jazz was born in the 20th
century with ragtime? For me, it
lies with the fact that ragtime was
a form that allowed musicians to
congregate and perform with fewer
restrictions that written music may
have unintentionally placed on
them. It comes as no surprise that
musicians who were unversed in
reading music formed the foundation
of this ‘birth’. Their musical ideas
were largely developed through
the process of combining western
harmonic ideas with traditional
African rhythms. A main theme may
have been evident, such as that in
Joplin’s ‘The Entertainer’, but this
could be altered in numerous ways,
akin to traditional call-and-response
drumming rhythms found in early
African music. The regular use of
syncopation in ragtime gave a taste of
what was to come – greater freedom
in expression, be it rhythmically,
melodically, or harmonically.
There is a reason, however, that
written music had prevailed for so
long. After all, the sense of familiarity
in a melody or harmonic structure
gives music its appeal, one could
argue. This is certainly true to some
extent; a melody that is memorable
gives a piece of music a sense of
identity, but repeat an idea for too
long and you’ll soon find the listener
in a state of boredom. On the other
hand, if you’re presented with a
particular melody but don’t return
to it, you leave finding yourself
uninterested, no matter how brilliant
the compositional or improvisational
techniques used. Jazz has lessened
the degree of predictability in music
and has given way to innovations in
music that leaves the listener wanting
more. Where a Beethoven symphony
may be satisfying to listen to multiple
times, we subconsciously learn that
the motifs within the piece will not
change whether it is played today or
tomorrow.
The only varying factor in the
performance is the technical ability
of the performer and his or her
emotional interpretation of the piece.
This is one aspect of classical music
that has remained unchanged for
many years, and perhaps ‘jazzing’ it
up from time to time wouldn’t do it
any harm. As talented as they are,
many classical musicians of today
are so intent on achieving technical
perfection that they lose the essence
of creativity – something that Chopin
and his contemporaries seemed to
have in abundance.
The pursuit of technical excellence
is a noble one however – a lack
of proficiency on your chosen
instrument could quite easily
lead to a lack of expression. Great
jazz pianists such as Bill Evans
were classically trained from the
beginning, which gave them a
technical foundation that comes
through so beautifully in their Jazz
playing. This leads me to talk about
Oscar Peterson – perhaps the most
technically gifted jazz pianist ever
to have lived. It is a well-known fact
that Peterson would sit at the piano
from 4 to 6 hours a day, with a large
proportion of this time devoted to
technical advancement through
meticulous attention to scales and
arpeggios.
What he did so well though,
contrary to many accomplished
classical pianists of today, was
challenge himself musically with
these technical exercises. The result
of this was a breath-taking display of
virtuosity and creativity that wowed
audiences across the world. From
his freakishly fast runs down the
piano, to his subtle reharmonisations
of popular standards, Peterson was
a fine example of how jazz gave
musicians an extra dimension to their
playing. The art of improvisation
would give great jazz musicians such
as Peterson the ability to let their
emotions fuse with the music, which
in turn gave every performance its
own unique touch. For Peterson, this
stayed true throughout his life, as an
unfortunate stroke in his later years
did not prevent him from performing
solely with his right hand. In fact,
many (including myself) would
still argue that a one handed Oscar
was better than his two handed
contemporaries!
So the 20th
century certainly saw
jazz’s rise in popularity. Whether
it was the two-step genius of Scott
Joplin or the unparalleled virtuosity
of Oscar Peterson, jazz gave rise
to a greater degree of spontaneity
in music. Where is jazz in 2015
then? In a good place, it seems. I
was fortunate enough to see Cuban
trumpeter Arturo Sandeval at Ronnie
Scott’s recently, only to be stunned
by his wonderful command of his
instrument across a wide array of
styles, ranging from modern funk
to traditional Cuban folk. Based on
this, jazz could almost be considered
to be too broad to be a ‘genre’ as such.
Instead, we should look at it as a
licence to express oneself, even if it is
in the context of Bach’s counterpoint
melodies written many hundred
years ago.
No matter what your trade as a
musician, keeping things jazzy can
only be a good thing.

classical

of today
