...Play — The Importance of Being Earnest
JACK STEADMAN
FILM EDITOR
Ihave such an obvious fondness
for Arcadia – and for Stoppard’s
work in general – that my picking
it as my favourite play seems like a
foregone conclusion. So let’s side step
that conversation by turning straight
to my second-favourite play. Now
comes the requirement to actually
think about the answer to this.
There are quite a few candidates
– Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem and
Mojo spring up as early contenders,
alongside the brilliantly funny One
Man, Two Guv’nors by Richard Bean.
But the winner is probably Oscar
Wilde’s last – greatest – play, The
Importance of Being Earnest.
There’s a lot of history surrounding
Earnest, not least the part it played
in Wilde’s eventual trial and
imprisonment for “gross indecency”.
It was at the opening night that the
Marquess of Queensbury, father
of Wilde’s lover (and somewhat
displeased at this arrangement),
attempted to present Wilde with
a bouquet of rotten vegetables (he
failed), and it was during the show’s
run that Wilde and Queensbury’s
feud made its way to the courts.
Earnest marked the pinnacle of
Wilde’s career, with the downfall
that must follow such a claim coming
brutally swiftly. 86 performances
later, Earnest closed. Public opinion
was no longer on Wilde’s side.
Despite that, Earnest endures.
Despite all the controversy
surrounding it, despite the
depressingly short original run, it
continues to find itself being revived
on a near-constant basis, regularly
appearing in some new form in the
West End.
The reason for that can be found
in the sheer joy of seeing Earnest
performed. Described in its full
title as “a trivial comedy for serious
people”, this is a play that takes
neither itself, the audience, nor its
apparent targets seriously. It’s as
much a farce as anything, dealing as it
does with multiple cases of mistaken
identity – each of them equally
improbable – as well as ridiculous
fascinations with names as a reason
for marriage.
Taking the text itself and
examining it, there’s not always
much to recommend Earnest. The
plot – as mentioned – is absurd.
The characterisations are often
flimsy. The satire is, these days,
borderline toothless, and the capacity
to introduce new relevance – as in
Shakespeare – is limited.
And yet, when put in the hands
of a skilled cast, it springs to life;
jokes that seem dated on the page are
suddenly hilarious; there’s enormous
space for physical comedy; the
interplay between the characters is a
joy to behold when the lines are being
thrown, rapid-fire, between skilled
actors.
Earnest is the ultimate example of
a ‘fun play’. It’s hugely entertaining
with a good cast, and from the other
side it’s a treat to perform. It’s a far,
far smarter play than its surfaces
suggest – I stand by all my claims of
toothless satire and limited relevance
– because its apparent lack of any real
subject is the whole point.
Earnest is as much Wilde’s two-
fingered salute to the literary
establishment of the day, and it’s
a salute that holds true now. As an
artistic point alone, it’s fantastic. The
fact it’s fun to perform and watch is
simply a bonus.

Next to Normal, with book and
lyrics by Brian Yorkey and
music by Tom Kitt, follows
Diana, a bipolar depressive with a
dead son, a rock star psychiatrist, a
daughter she describes as “a freak”
(and her stoner boyfriend)... and Dan,
her husband.
When it was on Broadway
during 2009-11, the production
controversially won the Pulitzer
Prize, and also gained a cult following
on YouTube and Twitter, before
closing in January 2011.
Bipolar depression is not an
easy topic to write a musical about
– and the pain felt by many of
the characters is scarily real. The
various attempts made to manage
Diana’s condition correspond to real
life treatments for bipolar II, and
watching each of them try, and fail, to
heal “the cut, the break... in your soul”
is terrifying to watch.
The addition of Diana’s son Gabe
into the mix lends something of a
sinister, seductive aspect to the show.
Their scenes, culminating in Diana
being led to attempt suicide, are made
more worrying by the fact that it
isn’t until the middle of the first act
that we even find out he’s died, and
it becomes clear just how far Diana’s
psychosis has progressed.
This is not to say that the musical
is altogether depressing. Diana’s
daughter Natalie and her boyfriend,
Henry, have some incredibly sweet
moments as he tries to pull her out
of her own spiral towards substance
abuse and depression. Their arc,
ending as it began, with the word “I
could be perfect for you”, is tinged
with a bittersweet acceptance of the
other.
Even Dan and Gabe find a
resolution of sorts. Natalie and her
mother reconcile, and we are left with
a more balanced, if disparate, family,
searching for “the light in the dark”.
Is Next to Normal misogynistic?
Maybe. It’s certainly true that Dan
is presented as a sympathetic figure
and Diana as something of a home
wrecker. Natalie is similarly seen to
be unable to handle things without
the strong hand of Henry. Even the
end of Dan’s arc relegates her to the
status of a caregiver. And it fails the
Bechdel Test. Which, given how much
else Natalie and her mother might
have to talk about, is quite upsetting.
The music, though, is wonderful.
It doesn’t have the richness of
Bernstein, nor does it require the
vocal gymnastics required for works
by Jason Robert Brown. Despite this,
it stands up as one of the strongest
examples of a rock musical score
I have heard to date, making it a
worthy winner of the 2009 Tony for
Best Original Score.
The show taps elements of the
human experience that we don’t get
to see all that often, filling a void
left unattended since Jekyll and Hyde
was released in 1997. It’s not perfect
– it’s not normal – but it opens out
the scope of musicals beyond what’s
been done before and since. Yorkey
and Kitt have done well with Bring
it On, the musical based on the little
cheerleading squad that could, and
If/Then, which starred Wicked and
Frozen’s Idina Menzel. Maybe they
could use some of this success to
launch a full British production?
