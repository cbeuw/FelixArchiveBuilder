THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 79
FELIX 06.03.2015
Vo
I’m Ben, the current RAG Chair.
I’ve been at Imperial for three years
now and have experience in a variety
of Union positions, including three
years as academic representative
in Physics, former captaincy of the
University Challenge Team and
Treasurer and then Chair of RAG. My
roles in RAG have given me a good
understanding of charity law, so I can
make sure that the Union as a charity
meets its legal requirements.
Student Trustee
In this time, I’ve seen what we do
well, but perhaps more importantly,
what we need to improve on. On
Union Council, I was able to pass a
paper that led to all representatives’
voting records are made public – so
that you can check we are doing our
jobs properly.
In terms of student engagement,
I will also push for the long-
promised ‘e-petitioning’ system to
be introduced in the next democracy
review, so that you can make your
voices heard. To further increase
transparency and accountability I
am happy to answer questions or take
criticism from any student.
I will also serve as your voice on the
Trustee Board, making sure that we
do things with proper consultation
– for example, I would have voted
against this new, unconsulted policy
that forces large clubs to hold their
elections electronically.

I will also make sure that we
improve our guidance to clubs on
what to do when things go wrong, to
avoid repeats of some of this year’s
incidents.
So, please trust in my experience
and vote Ben!
The Union needs change. In order
for anything meaningful to be
achieved, a change must be passed by
the Trustee Board, which ultimately
governs the Union’s actions. The
Student Trustees sit on this board and
enable the student voice to be heard
at the highest level of the Union and
College. Two student trustees will
be chosen in the Big Elections, and
I hope to be one of those with your
help!
Student Trustee
I’m a second year Mechanical
Engineer, and am heavily involved
in the Union. This year, as the A
Cappella Chairman (and a committee
member of A Cappella group ’The
Techtonics’) I’ve had the chance to get
to know the Union right to its core.
I believe that there is an issue with
the way in which student activities
are funded. This year I’ve been
campaigning to establish a clearer
and fairer tours funding policy and,
by working closely with the DPCS,
change looks to be implemented in
time for the next academic year. As
your Student Trustee I would push
harder for a full review of Union
funding strategy, enabling fairer
distribution of grants.
I am also a member of the LGBT
community and would ensure that
Imperial’s minority groups’ voices
be heard at the highest level, and
establish a strong line of action as a
Henry Harrod
result.
My experience, drive and
significant passion for improving
the Imperial student experience
hopefully makes me a good candidate
for Student Trustee.
Vote for a better Union. Vote for
Harrod.
As a Student Trustee, I will strive to
make the Student Voice of the Union
College louder and clearer, engaging
with every aspect of Union provision.
I am dedicated to the success of the
Union in its plans and long-term
targets and will put time and effort
into seeing them fulfilled. My policies
for the 2015-16 period include:
• Better student
representation on College Boards.
Recent developments surrounding
Student Trustee
communication between College and
students have proven that our current
paradigm doesn’t satisfy students,
and that our elected Officer Trustees
cannot be expected to cover all the
bases and be infallible. Support for
increased student representation has
come from faculty members, Officer
Trustees and even a Vice-Provost, so
the time is right to push for increased
student representation where our
experiences and issues are concerned.
• By evaluating the space
on campus and talking with Clubs
and Societies, I intend to see that
effective study space expands to
meet demand during exam periods;
for those who have the resources to
facilitate their revision and need only
a conducive atmosphere for revision,
I intend to push for later opening of
departmental buildings and use of the
larger Union venues.
• Improving volunteer

role diversity through the schemes
we have. By branching out and
forming new volunteer partnerships
through Community Connections
and the Imperial Hub, we can boost
participation in an activity that is
valuable to both the local community
and our future job prospects.
Hey I’m Nida, a PhD student and
the current Graduate Students’ Union
President. I’ve previously been the
International Officer, a News Editor
for Felix, a Hall Senior, a year rep,
and a member of numerous College/
Union committees.
I have also been a part of the
Provost’s 2015-20 College Strategy for
Imperial and would love the chance to
be a trustee.
If elected, I promise to:
Student Trustee
- Have through oversight and push
for transparency in new changes and
pre-existing procedures.
- Ensure the student voice is heard
at all levels. That includes good
representation of Postgraduate and
International Students as well as
every other student at Imperial.
- Support campaigns against
government policies that impact
students the hardest.
- Ensure the Union is engaging with
ALL students, which means a change
in strategy so students feel their voice
is being heard.
- Develop a long term robust
strategy that caters for the needs of all
Imperial Students
