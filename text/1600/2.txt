2 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

in her own section alone, alongside
a great spread in Culture about plus
size fashion.
My copy editorial team have been
reading, chopping and correcting all
day, with only minimal intervention
on my part, and my Deputy Editor
has also churned out the manifesto
layout for this year’s Big Elections.
In fact, every member of the team
has been outstanding this week: sorry
to be mushy but I am so proud of
my students that keep me sane and
functioning each week, and make my
job so exciting and fun and worth
doing even when slowly dying.
I literally have no idea how they do
it; I’ve spent the week in a flu-induced
haze, and have watched in seemingly
slow motion as the office has buzzed
around me, bringing Issue 1600
together and in seemingly good time
too; I might actually have an early
night tonight.
I would like to say a great big thank
you to my volunteers that go above
and beyond their roles to support me
as an editor and keep the paper in
check. I could not do this job single-
handedly, especially when knee deep
in ibuprofen packets and trying to
stop my lungs from escaping from my
mouth.
This week, we’ve been watching the
Big Elections with quiet scepticism
– with a lot of roles uncontested, it
is difficult to take candidates that
are likely to win too seriously and
scrutinise them properly. However,

This week, I’ve been blown away
by the amazing efforts of my
editorial team to put together
this momentous issue. Issue 1600 has
been talked about since the beginning
of last term, and how we planned to
celebrate this Felix milestone has
been constantly evolving. This final
form has taken hundreds of hours to
do, and we’ve been in late every night
and the weekends to get everything
done.
I am especially proud of my Arts
Editor, Fred Fyles, who took control
of our multi-section pull-out, Culture;
without him it wouldn’t be nearly
as impressive! Fred is a medical
student, and has managed to balance
hospital rotations with planning
and putting together forty beautiful
pages; something he’s managed to do
in a week, but something that took
me weeks to do when laying out the
Fresher’s issue.
I am actually slightly concerned
now my editorial team have began to
surpass me in skill and dedication; it
is only a matter of time before they
realise I’m really now just an office
accessory, overthrow me and take
over Felix completely.
Big shout out to Ben Howitt, who
has managed to work some sort of
InDesign magic into our templates,
whilst copy editing like a machine,
still finding time to campaign, do his
degree and even find some spare time
to run all his clubs and societies.
I would also like to praise my
dedicated and talented Comment
Editor Tessa, who has managed to
command eight whole pages this week
it’s not the Sabbatical roles that
should be commanding all the
attention – the roles that are done
purely by volunteers can be infinitely
more challenging and carry more
of a direct impact than some of the
student sabbatical roles.
It was a group of volunteers that
brought together the Meet the
Candidates program on Wednesday;
it was a complete group of volunteers
that ran ICSM RAG week that
managed to raise so much money,
and it is volunteers that day on day
keep our Union ticking.
So if you do decide to vote
tomorrow or next week, make sure
you spend some time thinking about
what people you think would be
the best to fill the volunteer roles
of next year; choose people who are
dedicated, hardworking, but also
passionate.
Joke candidates are great for a bit
of light relief, but remember that for
every joke candidate elected, that is
one role that cannot contribute to the
wider club, society or project they are
a part of.
Volunteers make the Union
tick; they run your clubs, your
representation network, your sports
teams and ultimately your student
voice.Vote for someone who you
know can do the job, do it well but
also loves what they do; they may be
rallying for your vote this week, but
in the end you’ll be thanking them
for making your student experience
so much more than it would be
without them.

We got nothing wrong last
week, apparently.
This is probably a mistake
in itself. Especially in 96
pages of Felix this week.
