34 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
06.03.2015
The field of optics was
founded during the scientific
revolution, leading to
large improvements in lenses.
Photographic paper was first
developed in the 19th
century,
around the same time that the first
phonographic sound recordings were
happening. Once these three existed,
it was only a matter of time until
they were combined to make the first
moving pictures.
The very simplest form of moving
image is one that has been made by
every primary school child for the
past century, the zoetrope. A cylinder
with vertical slits along the side,
with series of images pasted onto the
inside, zoetropes would then be spun
to create the illusion of movement.
These were very popular with
Victorian children and adults alike,
and are still a popular gift.
The first true projector was the
zoopraxiscope, invented by Eadweard
Muybridge in 1879. It is based on
a similar concept to the zoescope,
projecting images from a set of
rapidly rotating glass disks. It was
the zoopraxiscope that created the
first moving picture of something
in real time, rather that using staged
photographs. The first example was
of a galloping horse, and was actually
developed to see if a horse had all
four feet on the ground at the same
time whilst galloping. Early models
had the images painted onto the
glass, while later ones would print the
outlines and then do the colouring
by hand.
It is thought that this device is
one of the main inspirations for the
kinetoscope, the first commercial
film exhibition system, where the
moving pictures would be viewed
by by looking through a spyhole.
Though the original concept was
suggested by Thomas Edison, it was
actually mostly developed by one
of the employees in the Edison labs,
William Dickson. They also created
the kinetograph, one of the earliest
film cameras that could be used to
create films for the kinetoscope,
and a few years later released
the kinetophone, combining the
kinetoscope with a phonograph, the
first film-sound system.
Celluloid was first invented as
Parkesine in 1856, and was made into
photographic film by thinly slicing
blocks of celluloid then using heated
pressure plates to remove the slice
marks. These were then coated with
a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.
This process was perfected in 1888.
It was a 380mm wide strip made
by this process that was used in the
kinetograph. However this was too
stiff to meet the needs of motion
picture photography, so more flexible
celluloids were developed to be used
by 1889.
It was the Blair Camera Company
that supplied the Edison labs with
film stock. Originally they only
supplied film that was 40mm
wide, which would then be cut and
perforated to 35mm wide with four
perforations that allowed the film
to be moved through the camera.
Eventually Blair began supplying
film that was already cut to size. The
size and perforations were patented
by Edison, forcing the other film
producers in the US to create 68mm
film and a friction feed method
to move it through the camera. In
1902 a court decision invalidated
the patent claim, allowing anyone to
use the Edison format, as has been
happening in Europe where no patent
had be filed originally.
At this time there were many
projectors based on similar concepts,
moving the film past a lens which
would focus light onto the film,
which would then be projected onto a
screen. However different companies
would build them slightly differently,
so the film would have to perforated
slightly differently depending on
what equipment a cinema would
have. The Edison format was the
dominant version, and this was
chosen by the Motion Picture
Patents Company in 1909 as the
official standard, along with a 1.33
aspect ratio. This standardisation
had an enormous impact on the
film industry, as this meant that all
projectors were built to the same
specification, so for example a film
recorded in the US could then be
played anywhere in the world.
It was around this time that
celluloid began to be replaced, due to
the fact that it had the unfortunate
problem of spontaneously
combusting above 150Â°C, a
temperature that could easily be
reached in a projector. It had the
added problem of creating its own
oxygen supply as it burnt, meaning
that even if placed underwater
the film would continue to burn.
Acetate cellulose film was developed
to combat this issue, first being
produced in 1909, with several
revisions over the next few decades.
The safety of acetate film meant
that there was a large boom in the
home cinema industry. In 1923
Kodak released 16mm wide film, as
a cheaper alternative to 35mm. This
was followed up by a standard double
8mm wide film in 1932 as an even
cheaper alternative. This worked by
first filming on one side of the film,
then flipping the film in the camera
and filming onto the other side of
the film. These would then be cut in
half and spliced together to form a
continuous 8mm film to be projected.
In 1965 an improved version known
as Super 8 was released, which had
far better visual quality and did not
