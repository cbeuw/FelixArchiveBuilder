Clara Clark Nevola takes us through the life of Giordano Bruno
1600: A Year To Go Down in History
Atenuous numerical link is
enough to lead us from the
significance of the grand
history of Felix, now its 1600th
issue,
to 1600 AD, a year in the life of
Early Modern Europe. In dear old
Blighty, Elizabeth I is on the throne,
busily destroying the Armada and
maintaining her virginity. Martin
Luther has aired his doubts on the
big guy in the Vatican, and protestant
reformers are giving Europe a good
shake-up. The Church’s astronomical
dogma, already feeling touchy after
Copernicus going public on the
whole sun-centric thing, is further
challenged by Tycho Brahe pointing
out that a new star (the supernova
SN 1572) had appeared, and that the
celestial sphere isn’t so immutable
after all. Amidst all this, on the 17th
of
February 1600, a man was burned at
the stake in a small square in Rome.
Think of this as an obituary, almost
half a millennium out of date. The
obituary of a man on the border
between science and religion, a man
both heretic and martyr. This is the
story of Giordano Bruno.
The story starts in 1548, in the town
of Nola – then part of the Kingdom
of Naples – where Bruno was born.
He became a Dominican monk at 17
in a monastery in Naples, where he
was a bit of a performing monkey
thanks to his outstanding ability to
memorise stuff (think Sherlock’s
mind palace, but better). But he
wasn’t the top of the class for long.
Forbidden literature was found in his
loo (a self-annotated copy of Erasmus’
writing, not a 16th
century copy of
Nuts magazine) and he developed a
reputation for supporting free speech
– the horror! – as well as spreading
certain non-Catholic views.
The Kingdom of Naples wasn’t
a particularly liberal place at the
time so Giordano deemed it best
to leave the monastery and start
travelling towards the more liberal
Venice. From here he wandered
around for more than a decade,
crossing into France, Britain and
Germany. He taught in Universities;
visited monarchs, diplomats, and
intellectuals; and published a
good deal of critical pamphlets on
philosophy, religion and astronomy
that didn’t make his too popular with
many of his contemporaries and
colleagues.
He eventually returned to Italy
after he heard news of a job offer as
Professor of Maths at the University
of Padua. He didn’t get it; Galileo was
hired instead. I’m sure he got that
standard email about how the quality
of applicants had been very high that
year. But career disappointments
weren’t the only thing coming for
him: the Inquisition got wind of his
views and decided to crack down.
A seven year trial, dotted with
imprisonments, culminated in a
death sentence. He was publically
burned at the stake in Rome, in
Campo de’ Fiori, his mouth filled
with a wooden block to stop the
public hearing his dangerous
opinions. So that was that.
End of life, end of story. Another
heretic got rid of. And yet, in many
ways, the story of Giordano Bruno
started in 1600 with his death. The
Inquisition tortured and murdered
people for beliefs that we today
uphold as scientific and liberal.
The heretics of yesteryear are the
saints of today – Galileo is a prime
example in case. With Giordano
Bruno, the case is not so clear. Both
his life choices and his writings put
him on an ambiguous boundary
between science and religion: there
is a lunar crater named after him,
yet his commemorative statue in
Campo de’ Fiori shows him in his
Dominican robes. He upheld the
Copernican view of the universe
at a time when very few did, and
went beyond that to suggest that all
starts were suns, each with their own
planets around them; he stated that
the universe was infinite, without
a centre and containing multiple
worlds. Is he the forbearer of modern
cosmological theory and a martyr of
the multiverse hypothesis? Should we,
young disciples of a science-centric
atheism, herald him as our patron
saint? If you’re nodding vigorously
and preparing a little shrine for him
in your room, know that you are not
alone in your new-found realisation.
And yet, before you buy flights to
Rome to go on a pilgrimage to his
death-site, think on this: Giordano
Bruno probably never carried out an
astronomical observation in his life.
Yes, he was a proponent of
Copernicus’ heliocentric theory.
Yes, he wrote a book called On the
Infinite Universe and Worlds. But
his many worlds theory was, above
all, a pantheistic interpretation of
the universe. The scientific theory
is a metaphor for a philosophical,
spiritual approach to existence. Had
he been a brilliant mathematician
who used thorough astronomical
observations to formulate a theory
on the existence of other solar
systems, chances are that he would
have been burned as a heretic none
the less, as the Pope was none too
open to new ideas concerning the
universe. But Giordano Bruno wasn’t
a scientist by any standard. Is he
a saint for Cosmology? No. Did he
uphold ideas that questioned the
restricted, hemmed in doctrine of
his time? Yes. Did he have a lasting
effect in promoting a philosophy that
emphasised the centrality of human
intellect? Also yes. So if you’re buying
your tickets for Rome, go ahead
and count me in, because I’m a fan
girl. But let’s remember Giordano
Bruno for who he was and what he
promoted: the importance of free
speech, and the tolerance of views
based both on spirituality and insight
alongside those based on observation
and measurement. Both have their
place in our world.
