THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 41
FELIX 06.03.2015
Lost In Transbola
Lost in Transbola was the
winner of ICTV’s 48-hour
film competition, held in
October. The rules were to make a
film that was set at the end of the
world, including the phrase “This
is how I die” and an example of
dramatic irony, a technique whereby
the audience knows something the
characters don’t.
A comedy about a germophobic
tourist who comes to London and
learns about an Ebola outbreak, Lost
in Transbola was a comedic highlight
of this year’s programme. The tourist
desperately tries to cross London to
meet her brother while encountering
the worst place for a clean-phile in
London: the underground.
Although this was a first attempt at
filmmaking for many of the students
involved, it really doesn’t show. As
Station Manager of ICTV, it is really
exciting to see new students come
through and produce something,
especially when it’s done as well as
this, and generates a few genuine
belly laughs!
The director Oli Bauer is currently
working on a comedy about 3
students who steal the waxwork of
Tony Blair from Madame Tussauds
after a drunken night out; it will be
shooting in the next few weeks, so
keep a look out!
What this film shows is that if you
have an idea and make the effort
to write, shoot, and edit, it doesn’t
take much experience to make
something truly great. If you want to
get involved please send a message
to ICTV@imperial.ac.uk, and we can
put you in contact with the people
making the next production.

Nuisance
Fahdi Kanavati has been an
ICTV regular for the last year; a
filmmaker who’s had his shorts
shown at the Cannes Film Festival,
Kanavati is committed to making
great, fun films – at the expense of his
PhD, fingers crossed his supervisor
doesn’t read Felix.
Nuisance is a dark comedy about
a studio engineer who is forced to
record a flautist who he thinks is
terrible, only everyone else disagrees:
his boss thinks he is great; his
girlfriend thinks he is great; only
he can hear the true awfulness of
this flutist’s sound. He is constantly
followed about the maddening flutist
until it starts to destroy every aspect
of his life.
Kanavati, a man of many talents,
both wrote and directed this film;
he found the crew – both newbies
and old hands – at ICTV’s regular
film crew meets, and we utilised sets
available in the media basement and
elsewhere. Film-making can often be
a gruelling task, where anything that
can go wrong, goes wrong; in this case
it was impossible to get all the cast
for long enough meaning that not all
the actors could be in the final scene
at the same time. However using
his ability with after-effects, and a
canny shooting technique, Kanavati
managed to overcome this issue.
The ability to overcome the odds no
matter what happens is surely the
sign of a great director
I asked him for a quote about this
film and he unhelpfully replied: “Yes,
without ICTV the film would only
have ended up being in stick figure
drawings. It was written for after-
effects.”
Thanks Fahdi, we appreciate the
endorsement!
