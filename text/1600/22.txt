"This new
class of
antibodies
points
the way
for a new
approach
to a dengue
vaccine."
Researchers from the
Department of Medicine at
Imperial have identified a new
class of antibodies that is effective
against the virus that causes dengue
fever.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne
viral infection found primarily in
tropical and sub-tropical regions
around the world. However, in
recent years, transmission has
increased predominantly in urban
and semi-urban areas leading it to
become a major international public
health concern with an estimated
400 million infections occurring
annually.
Over 2.5 billion people (over 40% of
the world’s population) are now at risk
from dengue and the World health
Organisation (WHO) estimates there
may be 50-100 million infections
worldwide every year.
The primary vector of dengue is
the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which
lives in urban habitats and breeds
mostly in man-made containers.
Unlike other mosquitoes, Ae. aegypti
is a daytime feeder, with the females
biting multiple people during each
feeding period. Initially, the virus is
transmitted from infected humans
to uninfected mosquitoes, the virus
subsequently incubates for 4-10
days in the mosquito, after which
the infected mosquito is capable of
transmitting the virus for the rest of
its life.
Patients who are already infected
with the dengue virus can transmit
the infection for usually 4-5 days
(max. 12) via Aedes mosquitoes after
the onset of symptoms; the virus
cannot be transmitted from person to
person.
Dengue fever is a severe, flu-like
illness that can affect people of all
ages, but seldom causes death. It is
suspected when patients have a high
fever accompanied by two of the
following symptoms: severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen
glands or rash. Symptoms usually
persist for around one to two weeks.
Occasionally, dengue fever can
develop into a more aggressive form
called severe dengue (also known as
dengue haemorrhagic fever) which
is a fatal complication as it can lead
to shock (a sudden drop in blood
pressure), bleeding and organ failure.
As there is no vaccine as yet for the
dengue virus, the best way to prevent
infection is using common sense
precautions – such as hand washing,
wearing protective clothing and using
mosquito repellent – whilst travelling
to high-risk areas.
The dengue virus has four differnt
strains, called serotypes, which are
distinguished from each other by
their surface antigens. Recovering
from infection by one provides
lifelong immunity against that
particular serotype; however, if an
individual were to be infected by
another serotype, cross-recognition
by the immune system of the
other one may only be partial and
temporary, increasing the risk of
developing severe dengue.
Fortunately, researchers from
the Department of Medicine at
Imperial, in collaboration with
scientists from the Institut Pasteur
in Paris, have identified a new class
of antibodies that is effective against
all four serotypes of the dengue virus.
Antibodies are proteins produced by
immune cells (B-lymphocytes) that
can recognise and selectively bind
to specific parts (called epitopes) of
foreign objects called antigens.
The binding of the antibodies to
antigens on microorganisms such as
bacteria and viruses are what help
our immune system recognise them
as being foreign, so it can attack them
and neutralise their harmful effects
on our body.
In the study, published in the
journal Nature Immunology, the
scientists analysed blood samples of
infected patients in Southeast Asia to
examine the antibodies produced by
their immune systems. In the process,
the scientists identified a previously
unknown epitope, referred to as
the “envelope dimer epitope” (EDE)
which ‘bridges’ protein subunits on
mature virions (the infective form
of the virus, as inside the body)
and is common to all four strains.
Monoclonal antibodies, characterized
in the study, to the EDE showed a
strong response across all four strains
of the dengue virus.
These antibodies could potentially
be used either directly in the
prevention and treatment of dengue
infections or in the development of
subunit vaccines that could be used
to stimulate the immune system to
produce antibodies to the EDE.
"Over 2.5
billion
people are
now at
risk from
dengue."
In a second paper, published in
Nature, the researchers analysed the
structure of the antibodies, which
forms the basis of developing a
vaccine.
Professor Screaton, lead of the
study, expressed that “current vaccine
trials [for dengue] have shown some
promise but do not fully protect from
infection…this new class of antibodies
points the way for a new approach to
a dengue vaccine design which we are
pursuing”.
Up till now, there was no
specifically directed treatment for
dengue apart from paracetamol,
replenished fluid intake and resting;
this new antibody approach has
opened many further treatment
avenues for exploration. So it seems
like we may not be far off from being
able to greatly enhance our armoury
in tackling the rising incidences
of dengue virus infections and
complications in the near future.
