64 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

Kamil McClelland takes in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse’s atmosphere
Mark Rylance - Long Live The King
It is easy to forget how magical
London is at night but as I crossed
Millenium Bridge to reach the
Globe Theatre, perfectly perched
on the riverside, this feeling rushed
back to me. With St. Paul’s Cathedral
illuminated behind, I was suspended
in a state of wonderment as I entered
the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,
the Globe’s new indoor theatre space.
Created to extend the working life of
the open air theatre beyond sunny
summer days, the Sam Wanamaker
Playhouse is a truly mesmerising
indoor theatre space, built entirely
of wood in a late Elizabethan style:
intimate, hand painted and lit solely
by candlelight; I have never been
to a theatre quite like it. However,
this did come with a few downsides.
It seems there weren’t many people
who were 6’ 4” in the 17th
century,
which made fitting my knees into
the cramped rows a bit of a mission.
That, combined with uncomfortable
benches, reports of dripping candle
wax, and poorly positioned columns
meant that, although certainly
authentic, it wouldn’t be for everyone.
Having said that, it was the perfect
venue for Claire van Kampen’s
production of Farinelli and the King,
a story about fame and the curative
power of music. It recounts the tale of
Farinelli (Sam Crane), an 18th
century
castrato, and his relationship with
the King Philippe V of Spain (Mark
Rylance). Philippe, disabled by his
depression and unwillingness to rule,
is on the cusp of being kicked out of
office by his advisor De la Cuadra
(Edward Peel). In desperation, the
queen Isabella Farnese (Melody
Grove) travels abroad in search of
the famed Farinelli, the best singer
of the era. Once found, through his
voice, Farinelli is able to enliven the
king from his depressive slumber,
and each of them learns to rely on the
other for emotional fulfillment. It is a
tale of fame, duty and the therapeutic
power of music.
It was my first visit to the
Playhouse and it reminded me how
much of the artistic experience
is lost in large venues, where the
personal nature of the art is lost
due to your acute awareness of your
surroundings: the man coughing
two rows back; the lady flapping her
programme to the left of you. And
to walk in to live harpsichord music,
there is truly nothing that compares!
This is true of the music interludes
that stud the whole play, disguising
the scene changes expertly.
This is in fact van Kampen’s debut
as a playwright, although it seems a
natural progression of her previous
work as a composer and musical
director. However, this is no ordinary
play, as it’s musical components play
an almost equal role to the spoken
word, both adding integrally to the
progression of the plot. It also just so
happens that Rylance, in the title role
of King Philippe, is van Kampen’s
husband. Although some may argue
that this seems a bit iffy, all I can
say is that the resulting partnership
between them is sublime. Rylance
fills van Kampen’s characterisation of
the King perfectly: charming, hard-
headed, and witty, it may in fact be
that their close relationship helped
develop the character even more
fully.
One simply cannot fault the acting
performances in this production.
Rylance, behind languid eyes and a
deep sadness, is delicate and sensitive
in his humour, and you cannot
help but empathise with him – an
unwilling king shunted into a role he
never wished to fill. Crane as Farinelli
is equally witty and charming in his
sadness, yet has a hardened exterior
that comes from the humiliation
of his castration and his hollow
fame in the limelight. Best of all is
the simply phenomenal counter-
tenor Iestyn Davies, performing the
singing roles of the duality of the
Farinelli character. His performances
of Handel’s arias, such as the final
‘Lascia ch’io pianga’, are breathtaking.
Never have I before looked across
at other audience members, grown
men amongst them, mouth agape
in complete wonderment or eyes
glazed over by the haunting beauty
of his notes that float through this
wooden hall so perfectly. It was a holy
experience.
However, this was not simply a case
of highly talented actors and singers
carrying a poor libretto on their
shoulders; van Kampen has created
a story full of rich philosophical
discussion and oppositions. Through
the king, Farinelli is able to largely set
aside his stage persona, a self-division
visually portrayed by the dual casting
of Crane and Davies as Farinelli, both
dressed identically but each playing
an opposite aspect of his personality.
As well as discussing issues such
as fame, this play also raises the
importance of music in the treatment
and alleviation of all kinds of
mental illness, from schizophrenia
to depression. And just as Farinelli
is able to dissolve these feelings
of deep-seated misery in the king,
making him realise once again the
transcendent beauty of art and
nature, he is able to do the same in us
as his ethereal notes sooth us to our
core. And just as Farinelli’s talent, the
product of a lifetime of pain, is able to
ease the King’s ailments, reciprocally
the King provides Farinelli with a
worthy audience, not obsessed with
societal games, completely divorced
from the realities (ironically) of
upper class life. The King provides
Farinelli with perspective, showing
him that his depression and duality
is not a unique case, but rather a
commonality amongst all people
in his position, raised to fame and
fortune by factors beyond their
control.
And as the chandeliers once again
rose up, dimming the candlelit
stage in a subtle changing of mood,
I was left with the same restorative
feeling the King himself experienced,
through the music, singing,
acting and venue. It was overall
an extremely worthwhile theatre
experience that I would recommend
to anyone else.
Well, as long as they are not as tall
as I am!
Farinelli and the King is on at the Sam
Wanamaker Playhouse until 7th
March.
Tickets start from £10.
