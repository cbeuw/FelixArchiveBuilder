the Doctor Who series, leaving an
indelible mark of British culture.
The long line of exceptional female
composers has continued to this
day, with numerous women creating
music that transcends the boundaries
of art and music. For some of these
artists, such as Planningtorock, the
political struggle for equality is at
the front and centre of their music;
their most recent album, All Love’s
Legal, directly confronts the unequal
power structures at the heart of
society. ‘Misogyny Drop Dead’, for
example pairs lines like “degenderise
all intellect” with a funky bassline
and skittering drums, while ‘Let’s
Talk About Gender Baby’ has singer
Jam Rostrum mistily invoking
gender politics over stabbing
synths. Planningtorock have also
collaborated with Swedish sibling
duo The Knife, whose Shaking the
Habitual was a highlight of 2014,
lauded in both the mainstream and
alternative press for its innovative
use of abrasive sounds.
On the Hyperdub label, perhaps one
of Britain’s’ best known experimental
electronic record labels, there are
a number of women producers
represented: Jessy Lanza, for example,
whose debut album Hold My Hair
Back was hailed on its release in 2013,
praised by Pitchfork for its “sense
of self and attention to detail”, and
Experimental composer Holly Herndon, renowned for her combination of

garnered a nomination for the Polaris
Prize; Laurel Halo, a classically
trained musician whose switch to
electronica is a boon for us all, gifting
us with albums like Quarantine, a
combination of jazzy instrumentals,
sludgy drones, and skittering dubstep;
and Fatima Al Qadiri, an American-
based musician and visual artist,
whose upbringing in Gulf War-era
Kuwait fed into her Desert Strike EP,
and whose 2014 debut LP Asiatisch
aims to take us on a “virtual road
through an imagined China”.
One of my favourite artists
working right now, however, is Holly
Herndon, an American composer
who has divided her time between
Berlin and Mills College, California.
The resulting music has a sensibility
that lies halfway between academia
and euphoria, like Stockhausen
taking on the 02:00 set at Berghain
[the Berlin nightclub]. Herndon refutes
the widely accepted opinion that
computers are cold and impersonal,
arguing instead that the laptop not
only has the ability to unlock many
people’s musical potential, but also
forms a personal documentation
of the self. To that end, her music
revolves around the intimate. Her
debut LP Movement uses gasps
and breathing as a basis for tracks,
weaving them around densely layered
abstract electronics, while the lead

YouTube and Skype, arranged to form
a throbbing, foot-tapping monster of
a track.
Herndon has spoken about
attitudes towards gender within the
industry, and remains optimistic
about the future for women
producers. Speaking to Dazed
Magazine in 2014, she said that: “The
community of artists I find myself
involved with are pretty enlightened
with regards to gender issues, and I’m
rarely made to feel overly conscious
of it when in the company of peers.”
However, this attitude does not seem
to extend to the general public, or
those in charge of the music industry,
who hold women to a higher standard
than men. Speaking of Kanye West,
Bjork said “With the last album
he did [Yeezus], he got all the best
beatmakers on the planet at the time
to make beats for him... Yet no one
would question his authorship for
a second.” This double standard is
endemic to the industry, but it is sad
to see it begin to filter into a genre
that has historically been a safe space
for women composers. But people
are beginning to fight back; while
the internet has created a forum for
people to express their frustrations
at the lack of diversity, last year’s
Wysing Arts Centre’s festival of
art and music saw a line-up almost
exclusively focussed on women in
experimental and electronic music
and art. They called this year’s
iteration Space-Time: The Future, a
direct allusion to how women will
shape the genre’s future, just as they
laid its foundations in the past.
