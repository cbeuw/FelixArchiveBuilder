82 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
06.03.2015
Students in a house in
Hammersmith were left
both uncomfortable and
slightly aroused after hearing their
housemate have sex for five hours
straight.
Rob Carling, 22, was in the living
room watching a rerun of Take Me
Out: The Gossip, when the noises
started filtering down the stairs in
their terraced house behind Charing
Cross hospital. The uncensored
moans of passion and pleasure
started at around 20:15, just as Dick
was tucking into his Tesco Finest
ready meal (Spaghetti Bolognese).
The housemate in question,
Luke Caringdon, 22, brought the
unsuspecting female home around
19:20, after going for a drink with her
at the local pub on Fulham Palace
Road. The identity of the female
remains uncertain, as sources tell
Hangman that Caringdon’s mate of
choice was met online.
Rob told Hangman more about the
ordeal: “It was actually very sudden;
he made a cup of tea for himself and
her, then they disappeared upstairs,
and then literally five minutes later
the moans began.
“I can only speculate that they
either burnt their tongues downing
the hot beverages before copulation,
or they were left on the side, wasted”.
Rob became more distressed
however, as the sounds did not cease
for hours, long after Take Me Out:
The Gossip had finished. He told us
how he was offered a brief respite
as Caringdon went to get a glass of
water from the kitchen, but once he
returned up the stairs, the noises
began again almost instantly.
Rob then contacted their other
housemate, Jessica Late, 23, as he was
at a loss at what to do over the noises.
Jessica told Hangman: “I didn’t know
what to do either: I was working late
in the office, so luckily wasn’t present
to hear the noises in person, but I was
scared to go home”.
Jessica confirmed with Farmer
that the noises had stopped before
going home, although sounds ceased
around 01:00 – at which point Bratt
left the room again, sporting a
“suspiciously short robe”.
Rob told us: “He came out the
bedroom and downstairs wearing
a pink dressing gown, and some
fluffy slippers. We can only assume
he acquired these from a former
I
t may be a new year,
a (basically) new set
of candidates,and a
new election,but what
to expect never changes.
We’ve made you this
handy BINGO board to
cut out and keep,and we
suggest you take a few
copies for subsequent
years if you are a younger
student.That way you can
struggle through the two
weeks of campaigning hell
knowing what’s still yet to
come.Have you managed
to make it to the JCR
without seeing a poster,
being thrown a sweet,or
spotting a homemade
t-shirt? Such tranquillity
will not last for long!
Housemates forced to listen to student having
sex, interrupting takeaway dinner and Take Me
Out: The Gossip
flame, although as to why he would
continue to wear them around the
house after copulation we can only
speculate”.
Hangman contacted Caringdon but
he refused to comment, although he
did tell housemates he didn’t know
he was being too loud, and enquired
as to whether it sounded like the girl
was having a good time.
