fty years of projection, film, and sound in the cinema industry
The History of Projection
need to be reloaded. This was quickly
taken up by the public, and remains
a very popular medium for amateur
filmmakers. It is usually converted
from film to video to be more easily
worked with, a process known as
telecine.
The soundtrack was still mostly
sound-on-disk at this time,
being played on separately on a
phonograph at the same time at the
film played.The first method to put
the soundtrack directly on the film
was phonofilm, which was patented
in 1919. This recorded sound directly
onto the film from a microphone as
a series of parallel lines. This would
then be turned back into sound at
the other end this. It was mostly used
to film musical numbers, especially
opera singers, and political speeches.
Though the sound quality improved
over the years, it could never match
the quality of the sound-on-disk
systems and was no longer used by
1929.
Disney, in association with RCA
Records, also attempted to create
a sound-on-film system for called
Fantasound for the original release
of Fantasia in 1940, which had a
multi-channel soundtrack recorded
on a separate strip of film. This never
really took off as many cinemas did
not pay the expense to update their
equipment. This meant that not
many cinemas could play Fantasia as
originally intended, and is thought
to be a large contributing factor in
Fantasia’s poor original run.
The earliest films were all in
black-and-white, but in 1906 the first
colour process was developed. Known
as Kinemacolor, it used commercially
from 1908-14 and worked by
photographing and projecting
a black-and-white film behind
alternating red and green filters. The
second commercially process was
the very widely used Technicolor,
which was used to develop films in
Hollywood until 1952. It’s distinctive
saturated colouring was found in
such classics as the Wizard of Oz and
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
A large problem with many film
prints throughout the twentieth
century is what is commonly known
as “vinegaring”. When films are
stored in humid conditions the
acetate turns into acetic acid causing
it to turn brown and become brittle;
not only does this mean the film can
no longer be played, it also degrades
the image quality mean the film can
no longer be copied either. This has
caused the loss of many film prints as
it an irreversible process, and led to
the development of cellulose nitrate
and other film types throughout the
late twentieth and early twenty first
centuries.
Sound-on-film, based on the
Academy optical system, worked
by having an audio signal as two
lines running parallel with the film.
The lines grow thinner or wider
depending on the magnitude of the
signal. A light shined from a lamp
called an exciter is passed through
the film, and the intensity is detected
by a photosensitive element which
is then turned into sound. This
was originally black-and-white,
but due to the pigments being
environmentally unfriendly this was
switched to a cyan dye in the early
twenty first century. As cyan dyes do
not let infra-red light through, the
exciter was switched to a red coloured
LED or laser, which are backwards
compatible with earlier prints. The
Academy optical system suffered
from somewhat poor audio fidelity.
This problem was solved in 1975 with
the introduction of Dolby Stereo, a
system that was widely adopted by
cinemas world-wide and used with
Star Wars and Close Encounters of the
Third Kind in 1977. Dolby Stereo was
supplanted by the Dolby Digital AC-3
format and the first film to use the
system was Batman Returns in 1992.
In 2002, newly produced digital
projectors were tried out in cinemas.
These had issues with pixelisation in
some scenes. By 2006, this had been
solved, and the projectors themselves
became much smaller. Only a couple
of years later cinemas began to make
the switch to digital, and the film
distributors followed suit, with fewer
and fewer films being printed on
35mm. In 2013 it was estimated at
that 92% of US cinemas had switched,
and the last of the large UK cinemas,
Vue, had converted. By January 2014
most major UK distributors began
distributing films only in digital
formats, with Disney and Warner,
the last two companies stopping
soon after. Now only directors with
enough clout in the film world can
get their films printed on 35mm, and
it is thought that Christopher Nolan’s
Interstellar could be the last film in
the UK to be printed in the format.
It is possible that soon in the
future these digital projectors could
themselves become obsolete, with
large amounts of money going into
research into laser projection. This
would mean that the films would
be projected much brighter, with a
greater range of colours.
The current main issue with this is
that a vast cooling system is needed
to keep the projector at a constant
temperature as this leads to a colour
change, obviously a large problem
with film projection. However lasers
are being developed that are based
on different technologies that are
much easier to keep cool meaning
the challenges of keeping the laser
at a constant temperature would be
fewer. Until then, the screen belongs
to digital.
