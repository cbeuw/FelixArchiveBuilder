Felix 1600: Culture
The road towards the Felix 1600: Culture Section has been long and arduous. It was our editor, Philippa Skett, who first suggested the idea; given that the
output of Arts, Film, Music, TV, and Fashion had been of such consistent high quality this year, Philippa felt that a bumper ‘Culture’ section would be a good
call. Over time this swelled, from 24 pages, to 32, and finally to the 40 page behemoth you are holding right now. We couldn’t be more proud.
Of course, we haven’t done this alone, and the Felix Culture team would like to thank the following:

Finally, a few quick shout-outs: firstly, massive thanks to the various takeaway outlets who have kept us fuelled throughout this project (we’re looking at
you Number 10); also, the security guards at the South Entrance to the V&A for not confiscating our giant cat head during our hijinks; finally, thank you to
our editor, Philippa – we couldn’t have done this without your drive, your vision, and your insatiable appetite for children’s cough syrup.
