54 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX

Kamil McClelland reviews the Symphony Orchestra’s Spring Concert
Hitting The Right Notes: ICSO at Cadogan Hall
Tonight was a first in two
respects; not only was it my
first time attending a concert
in the gorgeous Cadogan Hall but
it was also in fact the first ever time
I had seen the Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra (ICSO) perform.
And so, as you can imagine I was
suitably excited.
This was their Spring Concert,
a celebration of a term of hard
work and careful planning. For our
enjoyment they were performing
Gershwin’s ‘An American in Paris’;
Mozart’s ‘Piano Concerto in D
Minor’; ‘In the Steppes of Central
Asia’ by Borodin; and finally the
incendiary ‘Firebird Suite’ by
Stravinsky. It was a crammed and
very varied schedule, designed to
illustrate the broad range of the
orchestra’s repertoire. I was also
eager to see Martin James Bartlett, an
18-year-old pianist and winner of the
BBC ‘Young Musician’ Award in 2014,
about whom I had heard great things,
perform alongside the orchestra on
the Mozart concerto.
Expectations were running high as
the orchestra took their place on the
stage in front of me.
And so, we dived straight into
Gershwin’s classic, a symphonic
poem laced with generous helpings
of jazz melody. He described it as
“the impression of an American
visitor in Paris”, simultaneously
absorbing the atmosphere of the
French capital in the 1920s and a
“spasm of homesickness” in the
form of syncopated rhythms based
around the twelve-bar blues format.
It truly is a beautiful tune, full of
the excitement and dynamism of
the Roaring ‘20s, done justice by this
impassioned orchestra. How lucky we
are to have such a talented group of
musicians on our doorstep!
To criticise them, I have to hold
them to the highest of standards —
perhaps they did not flow as well as
a truly integrated orchestra might,
unable to fully embody the dreamy
state of the piece, the vivid whirlwind
of sights and sounds every person
experiences when they visit such an
exciting city. I wasn’t completely
transported away to this foreign
land though not for a lack of effort;
the singing strings did a particularly
excellent job manipulating my
emotions every which way. The
problems lay mainly in a lack of time
and dynamic manipulation, but then
I am picking at the smallest of holes.
However, as Gershwin himself
admits, “it’s not a Beethoven
Symphony, you know” but instead a
“light, jolly piece”. Can this piece ever
be more than that, merely a pleasant
collection of notes, a musical in the
world of operas? Thus, as we went
next to Mozart’s piano concerto,
an incongruous pairing for certain,
I wondered how this selection of
pieces, a complete mess of genres and
emotions with no clear overarching
theme, was chosen. You do not
experience music as a singularity, it is
all about context. Hence, by placing
all of these pieces together, I felt I was
not able to truly witness their depth
of emotion – a real shame.
Next we were transported back to
18th
Century Vienna, and Mozart’s
‘Piano Concerto in D Minor’, a
considerably darker piece than
Gershwin’s jolly little number. The
fearsome strings build up to a forte
along with the rest of the orchestra,
powerful in their presence on stage.
Then the young virtuoso Bartlett
takes the lead, with the orchestra
in accompaniment – a tremendous
pianist with a deft touch on the keys
effortlessly glinting beneath his
fingers. He certainly doesn’t lack
charisma; you can read the emotion
in his face and body language as
well as in his music. This showman
style of solo piano playing is not
one I particularly like – perhaps his
masterclass with Lang Lang rubbed
off a bit too much – however, you
cannot deny his skill.
The piece is incredibly lyrical,
taking us on a journey from the
sombre to the joyous, with ascending
arpeggios vaulting up from the
instruments into the music hall.
Having said that, it is not my
favourite piece; sometimes boring,
often repetitive, at least it was
performed well.
The interval came and went in no
time at all, and as I made my way
back to my seat I readied myself for a
short but sweet trip across the serene
grasslands of Central Asia. Borodin’s
symphonic poem tells a simple
but elegant story: that of a trading
caravan of horses and camels crossing
the vast emptiness accompanied by
Russian soldiers. This manifests itself
as a complex blend of Western and
Eastern melodies, an amalgam of a
gentle Russian tune with “bizarre
and melancholy notes of an oriental
melody”. And through this all is the
continuity of the desert winds and the
trudging of pack animals. It is a truly
beautiful story, requiring respectful
and vivid playing.
This was generally well done, with
beautifully flowing strings and flute,
serene and peaceful. However, in
parts it did not feel suitably delicate,
as if the players did not have in their
minds the specific vision of the piece,
resulting in parts being too coarse or
loud.
And finally, the pièce de résistance:
‘The Firebird’ Suite by Stravinsky.
This is the score that catapulted
Stravinsky into the limelight and
represented the start of his very
fruitful partnership with ballet
patron Sergei Diaghilev which led
to the production of ‘Petrushka’ and
‘The Rite of Spring’. Thus the piece’s
significance cannot be underplayed,
with Diaghilev even saying of the
young composer that he was “a man
on the eve of celebrity”. And you can
fully understand why this was said of
him on the debut of its performance
in 1910 for the Ballets Russes
company in Paris. It is absolute
genius.
It was by far the most interesting
piece of the night. Emerging out
of the rich murkiness of the cellos
and double basses like a primordial
sludge, you are enraptured by
Stravinsky’s imagination, truly the
pinnacle of early 20th
Century art. It
was also the best played of the night;
the brute force of the percussion
and brass gave it real punch when it
was most required, simultaneously
as the harps rushed back and forth
across the soundscape, a marvellous
experience to behold.
What a way to end it! Does
anything compare to modern
works like this? Why ICSO insists
on including the likes of Mozart in
their lineup when they could have a
whole night of 20th
Century works I
do not know. But it was a wonderful
night overall and I would thoroughly
recommend anyone to attend ICSO’s
future performances, provided they
can create better cohesion with their
choice of repertoire.
