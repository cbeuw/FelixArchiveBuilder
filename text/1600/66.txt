Art History From A New Perspective
Irecently came across an opinion
piece in Art Review magazine
that discussed the crisis of the
contemporary within art, particularly
focussing on the difficulty in
finding a suitable label for the art
of the present day. With ‘modern’
art confined to a temporality at the
beginning of the 20th
century, and
the use of both ‘postmodern’ and
‘contemporary’ rapidly falling out
of favour, a new word is being called
for. The author drew attention to the
increased use of the term ‘now’, which
has seemingly been employed to
resolve this problem. At first glance,
the organisers of View Art Festival
at the Institut Français, were not
faced with confronting this dilemma.
After all, their ambitious programme,
which took place over the weekend
linking February and March, was
concerned with discussions around
the topic of art history.
The variety of events on offer
ensured that there would be
something to suit anyone with a
mild interest in the arts, even if that
something was merely fulfilling
a desire to rub shoulders with the
continental art crowd. There were
free short talks running throughout
the day on Saturday, complemented
by debates of a longer form to lead
on from the challenge posed by the
Friday night opening discussion
on ‘Redefining the Artistic Canon’.
The billing featured contributions
from many respected curators, art
historians and other representatives
of the French and British art
establishment. My favourite elements
of the programme related to the
Preserving and Restoring focus,
with questions such as ‘How do
preservation and restoration of art
works determine the course of art
history?’ under discussion by the best
minds in the field.
The concurrently running series of
student-led ‘salons’ with intriguing
titles along the lines of ‘The Tales of
the Killer Rabbit’, on the other hand,
ensured that a fresh perspective on
art theory from the next generation
of critics was also voiced. For a

insight into the Tate’s upcoming
Sonia Delaunay retrospective,
delivered by the curators of the
Parisian rendering of the exhibition.
The Institut Français provided a
particularly appropriate setting for
this discussion about Delaunay and
her ideology – one of her colourful
abstract tapestries normally hangs
above the main staircase of the
entrance hall.
Constrained by a short-talk format,
the speakers provided a regrettably
brief overview of the work and life
of this doyenne of modern art. A
key figure of the European avant-
garde, she defied easy categorisation.
Despite engaging with the numerous
emergent movements of the first
half of the twentieth century,
including particular intimacy with
the Parisian members of Dada, Sonia
and her husband Robert remained
at a distance and cultivated their
own version of what it meant to
be an artist in the modern world.
Delaunay’s understanding of this
transcended the boundaries of
aesthetic art and allowed her to
engage with fashion, interior design,
traditional craft, theatre and film as
media for delivering her message.
She often modelled her own designs
at social events, almost suggesting
an early version of performance art.
For Sonia Delaunay a line between
art and life was unnecessary; all of
her activities and collaborations bled
into and complemented each other,
continually drawing attention to
her other work. The curators argued
that this warm embrace of self-
advertising coupled to an interest
in the industrialisation of design
processes reflected a utopic vision
which had capitalism at its core. In
this way, she represented a stark
contrast to the similar developments
amongst her Russian contemporaries,
the Constructivists and Suprematists,
who were motivated by socialist
ideology. The talk was supported by
images of the exhibition, which along
with the persuasive rhetoric of the
speakers helped to generate a genuine
excitement for the opening of this
show in April. Apart from paintings,
the exhibition is set to feature
tapestries, photographs, costumes,
furniture and books – a feast for the
senses drawn from the richness of the
oeuvre of this remarkable artist.
In contrast to the talks, the guided
tour listings seemed to be the more
popular events of the Festival, with
all of the options selling out well in
advance of the opening night. I was
lucky enough to reserve a place on a
‘Behind the Scenes’ visit to Blythe
public less partial to the topics of
conservation and collections, the
‘Avant-Gardes and Precursors’
strand also had plenty to offer.
The star draws were probably the
Saturday night appearance of the
inimitable Jeremy Deller, winner of
the 2004 Turner Prize and Britain’s
representative at the 2013 Venice
Biennale, and a screening of the
Dadaist film Entre’acte on Sunday
afternoon.
Anyone who managed to attend the
‘My Night with Philosophers’ event
hosted by the same organisation two
years ago would be able to understand
my nervous anticipation of the
queues I was likely to encounter,
especially in view of the quality of the
programme. However, on entering
the main building of the French
cultural centre early on Saturday
afternoon I was surprised to find
the staff to visitor ratio peculiarly
balanced to oppose my expectations,
and the atmosphere surprisingly
subdued.
I was there to attend a fascinating
"Delaunay
cultivated
her own
version
of what
it meant
to be an

the modern
world."
"She

contrast
to the
Russians
who were
motivated
by Socialist
ideology."
