58 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
06.03.2015
Kamil McClelland gives us a tour of a world of tweed, gossip and wine
Press Nights – The Absurdity Of It All
One of the perks of writing for
the Felix Arts section has of
course got to be all of the free
tickets we get: plays, exhibitions,
opera, you name it (even puppetry…)!
I still find it amazing to think that
these art establishments actually
somewhat value our work, even if it is
just that free publicity trumps empty
seats.
It is certainly a very odd experience
going to a press viewing, sat there
awkwardly in the corner with your
biro and notepad feeling completely
under qualified to be in this position
(how did I find myself here, I’m a
medical student, aren’t I? I didn’t
even do A-level English!). And then in
come the big dogs – Times, Guardian,
Time Out – effortlessly at ease as if
they own the place. Elbow patches,
greying hair, weary eyes – a lifetime
of experience. How could I possibly
add something to this conversation?
However, behind this respectable
veneer of critical journalism – the
glossy façade – a less nuanced figure
emerges. It is not what one would
expect. Yes, perhaps pretension still
infiltrates their manner, but surely
amongst the top culture critics in
the land one would envisage finding
more refined conversation than
what I was overhearing; no Kant and
Nietzsche, more Kathy and Nigel.
It was fascinating. I had never heard
anything quite like it – just wall to
wall gossiping! It seems only quite
a small clique of reviewers visit all
of London’s latest shows, whatever
newspaper, website or blog they
might write for. On the Monday,
they’re at the National Theatre for
the latest production, the next day
the Barbican and the day after that,
the Royal Court! I guess they must
get to know one another pretty well.
It is also the perfect networking
opportunity, surrounded by your
counterparts at the rival newspapers,
each person vying like vultures for
the next job opening more senior that
their current one. To get into this
inner circle where everyone knows
everyone, and every single part of
their lives, you need to be able to talk
the talk and walk the walk.
Then you have the freelancers, the
mavericks of the group working only
a few nights a week and charging
double for their reviews. These
guys are sharply dressed, cocky, and
usually look at you with an even more
upturned nose than usual. This is an
industry where to survive, you must
either know the right people or back
yourself so much that you’re able to
fake it to make it.
It’s the interval, twenty minutes of
respite and time for me to reflect on
what happened in the first act over
a acrid glass of the complementary
chianti. I didn’t particularly like the
main actress, she didn’t have the stage
presence needed for her role. But the
stage design was br...
“Oh, did you hear about Rachel? I
heard her and John broke up.”
“But they’ve been together for
years! Well, I always thought she was
too good for him anyways.”
It is one of those freelancers again;
as I carry on listening, the plot
thickens even further. It transpires
that the freelancer, a very slick, well
turned out man, has also recently
been made a bachelor of sorts (“It’s
just that I’m always too busy flying
between London and New York, it
wasn’t a sustainable relationship”). As
soon as the other man finds out, ever
so subtly, he starts hitting on him,
dropping compliments about his new
haircut or shoes or making sexual
jokes. It was quite extraordinary. I
backed away from the conversation; it
was getting too awkward even for me.
Alongside them, you had the classic
Statler and Waldorf type art critics,
hardly able to keep their eyes open,
completely dulled by half a century
of service. Yes, they may have the
experience but how could people like
these possible make commentary
relevant to today’s world? They could
hardly see beyond their drooping
eyelids and cataracts. You can
understand why I felt utterly out of
place in this whole environment.
We may be quite a humble
production, little old Felix tucked
away in the basement of Beit Quad,
however I am going to argue that we
do actually hold quite an important
role in the world of art reviews. For
not only do we have access to a very
important cohort, the capital’s future
art consumers, but we also provide
a rare perspectival counterpoint
to the homogenous and formulaic
pieces much of the country’s press
is coming out with. Yes, I may not
be able to contextualise this piece of
meta-theatre in the history of Eastern
European interpretive dance, but
the utility of a fresh set of eyes on a
production cannot be underplayed.
We have not been tainted and
influenced to as great an extent by a
status quo, and can provide a much
more instinctual review based on our
viewer experience.
That is why it is disappointing
that we are either shunned away
to the worst seats in the house,
barely able to even see the stage, or
sometimes even flat-out refused
press tickets as a matter of course by
certain institutions (*cough* Royal
Opera House *cough*). Not only
does it harbour poor relations with
students, but it also decreases the art
house’s exposure amongst their most
important demographic, the future.
So whilst only the snooty reporters
who are becoming part of the
furniture, at one with the brocade, are
being invited to press shows, we will
still only get one aspect of the artistic
picture; a picture that is purely
aimed at rich elderly white men, who
funnily enough make up the large
proportion of the critics. And until
things change, I shall still be the
minority, shoved off into the corner,
just me and my complimentary white
wine.
We are always looking for new
reviewers. If you have a love for free press
tickets and cheap chianti, drop us a line
