Is Imperial changing for the better?
I’ve been at Imperial for seven
years, which is quite a long
time – longer than most. In that
time, I’ve seen a lot of change. Some
of these changes are ones I never
imagined happening, like the loss
of Evelyn Gardens, which was my
home as a fresher, but they’re mostly
overwhelmingly positive.
Imperial can sometimes seem like a
bit of a depressing place. For the vast
majority of your time here, you’re
stressed and overwrought, and, from
what I’ve seen, it can seem like a
really negative place to be a lot of the
time. When people ask me why I’ve
stayed here so long, and done three
different degrees, I often compare it
to Stockholm syndrome, and that I’ve
eventually come to love my captors.
But I’ve really enjoyed my time at
Imperial. Some years have been better
than others, and I’ve hit many pitfalls
along the way. I’ve experienced some
truly unacceptable things, from
blatant unapologetic sexism, to
unfathomable lacks of empathy, but
I’ve also seen Imperial change and
grow and develop into something far
greater than it was before.
When I did my undergraduate
degree in physics, the vast majority
of the lecture courses didn’t supply
notes, so if you didn’t go to lectures,
that was it. We didn’t have printed
notes (available online), which is
usually the case now, and we certainly
didn’t have the lectures recorded
for later viewing. Our tutorials
were practically non-existent, and
definitely didn’t constitute the
increased compulsory contact hours
that students have now. It gives me a
warm happy feeling to see things like
Panopto go from crazy ideas to being
fully implemented and used. Tuition
fees may be higher now, but people
are definitely fighting to get more for
their money, and it is working.
Universities have such rapid
turnover, and it’s sometimes hard to
feel like anything makes a difference
when you come and go so quickly,
never seeing anything go from the
concept stage to fruition. The people
currently protesting the future
closure of Weeks Hall will probably
have left by the time it comes to pass,
in the same way that most people who
ran the #AgainstActon campaign
won’t be here to see Woodward open
in October. But students do make a
difference, and if you’ve stuck around
as long as I have, you can start to
see that all these little things do add
up to a positive, albeit slow, change.
Imperial isn’t perfect, not by a long
stretch, but it’s full of well-meaning
students who want to make it better,
and that counts for a lot.
I used to really dislike Imperial, and
being a part of Felix has definitely
been a huge part of my unalienation.
In a way, it’s opened my eyes to some
of the darker sides of College and the
Union, and the injustices that take
place, but it’s exposed me to so many
people who I would otherwise never
have met, with nothing in common
but a desire to voluntarily give up
time to produce something purely for
the entertainment of other Imperial
students.
I wish I’d been brave enough to get
involved with Felix years before I
did, because now I realise that there
was nothing to be afraid of. I used
to think that it was an untouchable

Tessa Davey looks back on seven years of Imperial and Felix
publication, and that I would have
nothing of value to contribute to it.
But now I realise that it’s not. It’s
just a bunch of students, sitting in an
office, using their free time to write
articles, because they enjoy it.
As times change, Felix does too.
When I arrived at Imperial, copies of
Felix were distributed to the rooms
of every fresher in halls, and right
from the moment you arrived, you
started reading it. It was an Imperial
institution; in Friday afternoon
lectures, everyone had a copy open,
which is sadly no longer the case as
print newspapers fall out of fashion.
If I look at the archived issues
from my undergraduate years, I
remember so many of the articles in
the Comment section starting heated
discussions (often had out in whispers
during lectures), and none more than
those of Angry Geek (or A. Geek, as he
was originally known). I’m constantly
surprised every time someone hasn’t
heard of him these days, but of
course, he hasn’t graced our pages
with his impassioned words since
2012, which means that his legacy is
beginning to be forgotten.
But Angry Geek meant a lot to
me. He wrote from 2007-2012,
which covered my entire time as
an undergraduate. He is probably
the reason that I’ve always read the
Comment section so avidly, and why
I jumped at the chance to edit and
write this section. For the 1600th
issue, we tried to contact him, on the
off-chance he was still checking his
old email account, to see if he wanted
to write something. What came back
was beyond my highest expectations,
and I’m honoured to be able to print
it.
Angry Geek rejuvenated the
Comment section, directly inspiring
articles that brought it back from
non-existent to overflowing. Reading
back through his old articles in the
archives, I’m reminded that he wasn’t
just an angry bastard, but someone
who truly cared about expressing
opinions, and that is a heritage that I
want to uphold. I’m so touched that
he still reads Felix, and that he’s proud
of the section as it is today. I’m glad
he’s still angry, and using his anger
for good things. I hope there are still
people who remember him around
to read; his article has brought me
to tears every time I’ve read it, and
I don’t think I’m the only one for
whom this article will be poignant.
Angry Geek, I still don’t know who
you are, but if you want to get a drink
and bemoan the rising cost of drinks
at the Union Bar, I’d love to meet you.
