Celebrating
the
1600th
issue:
best
films
of
1949
–
1981
1949: The Third Man
Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles
star in this atmospheric Cold War
thriller masterpiece that was the most
successful film at the British box
office in the year of its release.
1950: All About Eve
Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be
a bumpy night. Get ready for Bette
Davis on her snarkiest, bitchiest form
as Margo Channing, an ageing actress
threatened by a young star.
1951: A Streetcar Named Desire
Led by a quartet of unforgettable
performances from Marlon Brando,
Vivien Leigh, Karl Madden and Kim
Hunter, this tragic play gets the
perfect screen makeover.
1952: Singin’ in the Rain
Gene Kelly’s iconic singing and
dancing in the rain will forever be
remembered and treasured, as will
Donald O’Connor’s intense ‘Make
‘Em Laugh’ sequence.
1953: Roman Holiday
The perfectly cast Audrey Hepburn
and Gregory Peck share something
special here: a chemistry so natural
and convincing that it makes the
finale all the more bittersweet.
1954: On the Waterfront
As a low-life bum destined for a life
of crime, Marlon Brando’s award-
winning struggle for a better path
is the kind of acting magic you will
never see again.
1955: Rebel Without a Cause
James Dean’s effortlessly cool look
is something that can never be
duplicated, whilst the radiant Natalie
Wood provides lovable support along
the way.
1956: The Killing
A carefully laid out plan to steal
2 million dollars goes terribly
wrong with exhilarating twists and
unexpected outcomes thrown in there
for good measure.
1957: 12 Angry Men
Sidney Lumet’s claustrophobic
legal drama set entirely in a jury’s
deliberation room is a quietly tense,
incredibly detailed and layered
courtroom film.
1958: Vertigo
There is something deeply hypnotic,
sinister and confusing about detective
John Ferguson’s (James Stewart)
search for the truth in a highly
complex case.
1959: Some Like It Hot
There has never been a better
screwball comedy ever since Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis decided to
dress up as women and both fall for
Marilyn Monroe.
1960: The Apartment
It deals with a relatively serious
subject matter of infidelity given
when this was made, but it remains
timelessly funny, sweet and upbeat
even to this day.
1961: The Hustler
The darker the themes get, the better,
as greed, alcoholism, gambling, and
addiction all taint the clean-cut image
of the idealistic hopeful pool player
Eddie Felson (Paul Newman).
1962: Lawrence of Arabia
The grandest epic of epics, David
Lean’s big-scale sweeping masterpiece
is remembered fondly for its
enormous dessert action sequences
and the brilliant Peter O’Toole.
1963: The Great Escape
Steve McQueen riding a motorbike
as he flees from an impenetrable
Nazi prison camp during the Second
World War solidified his status as the
‘cool’ dude of cinema.
1964: Dr Strangelove
Stanley Kubrick’s outrageously funny
satire, poking fun at the Cold War
and international politics, benefits
from having the talented Peter Sellers
take on three principal roles.
1965: The Sound of Music
There is no family more coordinated
and musically talented like the
von Trapps, and their sweet sound
of music lives on, even to this day,
almost fifty years later.
1966: Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?
Four people get drunk, shout and
scream at each other, arguing
over various things, most of them
stemming from marital strife.
1967: Bonnie and Clyde
Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty
bring to life the two notorious
criminals who robbed banks and
eventually met their tragic ends
because of it.
1968: The Lion in Winter
Katharine Hepburn’s fiery
performance that earned her one
of her four Oscars is reason enough
to give this entertaining medieval
historical romp a look.
1969: Midnight Cowboy
Unexpected friendships arise from all
sorts of places, but nothing is more
surprising than one that develops
between a prostitute (Jon Voight) and
a conman (Dustin Hoffman).
1970: MASH
As a war-time black comedy set
during the Korean War, it has that
strange mix of being as hysterical
as it is often depressing, directed by
Robert Altman.
1971: McCabe & Mrs Miller
Julie Christie, who Al Pacino called
the “most poetic of actresses” is a
real standout here as the titular
Mrs Miller, smartly fighting for her
corner in a male-dominated society.
1972: The Godfather
Many consider this the greatest
film of all time, and Francis Ford
Coppola’s mafia movie certainly lives
up to the high expectation, starring
the great Marlon Brando as the Don.
1973: The Exorcist
Linda Blair, voiced by Mercedes
McCambridge, will forever remain
as one of the scariest, most terrifying
incarnations of cinema. All other
children have nothing on Regan.
1974: The Godfather Part 2
With a clever structure of parallel
narratives set in two different time
periods, there is further enrichment
of the strong characters we have come
to love from Part 1.
1975: One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest
A hugely important and influential
film, the public’s perception of the
world of psychiatry has never been
the same since its release.
1976: Taxi Driver
“You talkin’ to me?” is the defining
moment of Martin Scorsese’s
hypnotic vigilante film, starring
Robert De Niro in a period where his
career was rocketing to new heights.
1977: Annie Hall
In the titular role, Diane Keaton is
utterly delightful, and has the chance
to show off her singing, too. She and
Woody Allen make a funny, quirky,
and touching couple.
1978: The Deer Hunter
It may be heavily one-sided in its
harsh portrayal of the aftermath of
a brutal war, but there is undeniable
power in Michael Cimino’s lengthy,
but completely gripping war drama.
1980: Raging Bull
One of Scorsese’s finest directorial
achievements, it stars Robert De Niro
in his second Oscar-winning role,
for his intense portrayal of a violent
downward spiral of self-destruction.
1981: Reds
Actor/director Warren Beatty and
Diane Keaton (what a performance)
play real-life political journalists
Jack Reed and Louise Bryant who are
hopelessly in love.
1979: Apocalypse Now
One of the most unforgivable
travesties of the Academy history
is how Kramer vs. Kramer managed
to beat out Francis Ford Coppola’s
audacious, haunting Vietnam picture.
