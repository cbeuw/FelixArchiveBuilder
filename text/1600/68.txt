68 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
06.03.2015
Rarely has there been a painter
who represents the darkest
recesses of humanity more
skillfully than Spanish artist
Francisco Goya. Making his living
as a court painter for the latter half
of the 18th
Century, it wasn’t until
1793, whilst recuperating from
a disease that would leave him
permanently deaf, that he began to
paint the violently disturbing scenes
for which he is best known today.
Saturn Devouring His Son; The Sleep of
Reason Produces Monsters; the entire
The Disasters of War series; all of these
are deeply unsettling visions of the
blackness fundamental to human
nature, and it is for these, more than
for his masterful court scenes, that he
is most celebrated today.
As part of his convalescence, he
began painting a series of private
albums; these works contained
neither preparatory sketches nor
a diary of what he saw, but instead
acted as a record of thoughts,
dreams, and fantasies – they were,
in other words, fundamentally
private. However, whatever qualms
one may have about prying into
another’s personal work is swiftly
quashed by the sheer magnificence
of The Courtauld Gallery’s latest
exhibition. In an astonishing feat of
curatorial adventuring, Juliet Wilson-
Bareau, one of the world’s leading
Goya experts, has brought together all
the extant drawings from a single one
of Goya’s albums, presenting it - for
the first time - as a complete whole.
The result is nothing short of
magnificent. The Witches and Old
Woman Album - not a name chosen
by Goya, but rather by art historians,
thanks to its themes and subject
matter - is a collection of 22 works of
watercolour and ink, whose small size
belies the emotional power they hold.
Some are grotesque, such as Unholy
union, in which a grinning figure, clad
in a flamenco-style dress, carries away
a snake-bound man; others are pitiful,
like Can’t go on any longer at the age
of 98, whose central, ancient figure
shuffles forward, back bent double,
supported by two worn sticks. While
Goya may not have been particularly
favourable in his portrayal of the
elderly, with a penchant for wizened
crones and toothless hags, his work is
unmistakably humanistic, conveying
all the joy and misery of life.
This duality is reflected in his rising
and falling figures, a popular feature
of his work – in Regozijo (Mirth), two
figures are shown suspended on an
expanse of white paper, seemingly
floating. One figure, who appears
to be a man, although nothing is
certain in these works, stretches his

arms out to his sides, while the other
gazes up, her legs akimbo and her
mouth twisted into an exaggerated
underbite. They follow the themes
explored in his earlier set of prints
Los Caprichos, a selection of which
are presented in an anteroom in an
effort to give historical context which
is interesting, albeit unnecessary:
the Witches and Old Women album is
strong enough to stand up on its own.
Goya’s work in this album
repeatedly returns to a number of
key themes. Chief among these is
nightmares: Goya draws a direct link
between dreaming and the grotesque,
bringing to mind Freud’s saying that
‘dreams are the royal roads to the
unconscious’. Some, like He wakes up
kicking and I can hear snoring, directly
allude to the process of sleeping and
waking, while in others the contents
are so horrific that we have little
choice but to conclude - or perhaps
hope - that they must be the products
of bad dreams.
One such example is Wicked woman,
which truly is the most unsettling
image in the whole gallery – a witch,
whose face resembles nothing more
than a skull, over which skin seems
to be merely draped, grasps at a
baby, its spine twisted, intent on
feasting. These are all nightmares.
It is as if Goya were gripped by a
malarial fever dream, ink pot in hand,
consumed by the desire to record
his unholy visions. The blank space
that surrounds most of the figures,
which are isolated in the centre of the
page, only reinforces this off-kilter,
nightmarish quality, conveying a
sense of supreme loneliness.
While the paintings themselves are
magnificent, what is truly inspiring is
the skill with which the curators have
assembled the pages of the album,
which have been scattered across the
globe. Furthermore, expert analysis
has allowed the original order to be
deciphered, knowledge which had
previously been lost thanks to heavy-
handed cropping of the images, which
led to the numbers denoting the
progression being removed.
Berlin, New York, Paris; these
pictures have travelled a long way to
be here, and to have them assembled
in a single room is breathtaking,
allowing us to take in the full breadth
of skill on display in Goya’s work.
With a deft use of little more than
black ink, washes of watercolour, and
a razor, Goya has conjured up some
of the more profoundly affecting
drawings I have had the privilege
of laying eyes on. A combination
of the figurative and the abstract,
these pictures, which range from
the supremely delicate to the
unapologetically bold, simply cement
Goya’s already-solid reputation as
a fundamental bridge between the
romantic and the modern. I am
thankful to the Courtauld Gallery,
and particularly to the efforts of
Wilson-Bareau, for assembling the
Witches and Old Women album, and
allowing us to experience the full,
magnificent, terrifying glory of
Goya’s darkest visions.
