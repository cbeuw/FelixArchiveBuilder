Angry Geek return
Hello,readers.It’s been quite a
while.I’m still a part of Imperial,just
hanging onto the edges here,but it’s
been years since I last graced these
pages.New writers have to come
in,and old ones have to shrivel up
and quietly die in the corner under
a pile of back issues–it’s the way
it’s always been.It also helps that
you’re all a fucking disgrace and I
probably would’ve burned several
key departments to the ground by
now in complete disbelief at the
pathetic and cynical way they’re run.
But mostly it’s the new writer thing.
It’s Felix’s 1600th
and so we’re
reflecting on the past of the
publication.Felix has always been
a mix of good and bad: it’s a place
where people can go to be creative
in a shitstorm of“I Fucking Love
Science”fetishism and coiffured
arseholes reading the Financial
Times and pretending to be
intelligent.On the other hand,it can
also give people the opportunity
to air harmful views in the name
of‘comment’or being a contrarian
arsehole.I’ve seen people defend
sexism,spit on the poor and laud the
financial sector in columns on the
Comment pages over my years–and
I’ve also been part of the problem
myself,especially in my early days.
You might not know this,but
Angry Geek started off as a way to
revitalise Felix Comment.We wanted
to encourage people to write in,and
I figured that a mysterious,polemic
writer might help.The first few
columns were more or less entirely
nonsense trying to get a rise out of
people,and looking back on them
now I’m a little sad at how far I went:
I joked that the economic inequality
in South America at least led to my
coffee being cheap,for instance.
Fortunately,after a few weeks of not
actually getting a rise out of anyone,
I took the column over properly.
Angry Geek wasn’t a character any
more: it was me,and I realised just
how angry I was.I imagine anyone
who remembers those pieces is long
gone from Imperial now,but I’m
genuinely sorry if I offended anyone.
Only for the first three articles,
obviously.If you think I give a shit
about offending someone’s feelings
about Canary Wharf then we’re
clearly on the wrong page.
Imperial is a nasty place,and
the longer I wrote this column,
it became more obvious to me
how nasty it is.After those first
few,ill-advised pieces were out of
the way,I wrote about the shady
influence of the financial sector over
graduate employment,the toxic
attitudes of superiority among the
rich and privileged students,and
the uncomfortable state of student
loans.Some things don’t change,
it seems–years may have passed,
but Imperial remains the same.I’ve
since become a postgraduate,still
working at Imperial,and am still
uncovering things I dislike about
this place with each day that goes by.
Mindblowing elitism,short-sighted
obsessions with money and rank,
and a more blinkered view of the
world than a particularly narrow-
minded horse who’s just fallen
down a ditch.Imperial’s sickening
obsession with being the richest and
"... a
mysterious,
polemic
writer"
