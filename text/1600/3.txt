Election hopefuls grilled at Meet the Candidates
Wednesday once again saw
the annual broadcast of
Meet the Candidates by
Imperial College Television (ICTV),
where candidates for the various
Officer Trustee roles, as well as Felix
Editor, Council Chair, and Student
Trustees debated live on air as part of
their campaigns to win the election.
The production, which was also one
of the first collaborations between IC
Radio and ICTV in the refurbished
media basement, also featured a
“pundit panel” made up of former
sabbatical officers for the first time in
recent history.
The panel consisted of Matthew
Colvin (Felix Editor 2011-12),
Jason Parmar (Deputy President
(Education) 2011-12) and Marissa
Lewis (Deputy President (Welfare)
2013-14), and was chaired by
Mechanical Engineering student
George Butcher. The show itself was
chaired by EEE finalist Thomas Lim,
who also produced the show alongside
Pete Brook.
Whilst viewers were treated to a
rare glimpse of the ICTV control
room in the West Basement of Beit,
the main focus of the show was on
watching candidates answer questions
posed to them. These questions were

mostly written by the ICTV team,
with a number of other questions
submitted by viewers via the hashtag
#voteicu.
Whilst a number of the positions
had either only one person running,
or only one person able to attend the
live broadcast, a good degree of debate
was had for many of the positions.
Candidates for Student Trustee were

Do you want to name a satellite?
Imperial’s Vehicle Design Society
are currently in the process of
designing and building what will
hopefully be Imperial’s first ever
student satellite.
The type of satellite being built is a
CubeSat—a tiny and relatively cheap
satellite, just 10cm cubed in volume.
Invented in the nineties in America
to teach students about the basics
of satellites, these tiny standardised
units are now making it easy for
many more diverse groups to access
space at low costs.
This project will in fact be more like
a RectangleSat, as it consists of three
CubeSats stuck together. Its aim is
to put into space a camera with the
highest resolution of any CubeSat to
date, at 1.5m of the Earth’s surface
per pixel.
Its ultimate goal is to be able to
aid search and rescue missions
by detecting and locating distress
signals. There is currently a network
of satellites to designed for this
purpose, but these were developed
in the seventies and haven’t been
updated since. This project aims to
show how the existing system can be
improved with minimal investment,
though it also hopes to test several
other engineering ideas, for example
an origami-based deployable solar
panel, never before tested in small
satellites.
“This project is a first-of-its kind in
Imperial,” said Javier Maurino, the
project manager. “Developing a nano-
satellite is a unique way to promote
space exploration and science, but it is
also very challenging. However, when
you have scientists and engineers
from very different backgrounds
working together towards the
same goal, the results are simply
incredible.”
This project has brought together
almost a hundred Imperial students
from many departments, all with
the hope of putting this satellite into
space. Money has been secured from
the university to design and create
a prototype, but the total budget
for the project is £43,000. Once the
prototype and design have been
completed and tested, this summer
the project will be pitched to space
agencies to gather the remaining
funds it needs for completion and
launch.
Even at this early stage of the
project, it has already taught the
students involved much about the
processes involved in the real-world
space industry.
‘This project is fascinating because
it enhances the understanding of a
real industrial process, and being
led completely by students also
teaches the importance of internal
organisation and teamwork,’ said
Andrea Vivaldi, head of logistics and
finance.
David Cava, systems team leader,
said: ‘Having something flying
around the Earth developed by a
group of students sounds to me
more as science fiction than real life.
Determination and lack of fear are
required for this project and that is
what I like the most about it.’
So far however, the satellite is

unnamed. Like the rest of the project,
its name needs to be something
eye-catching to help the project catch
the attention of space agencies. This
is why the students have set up a
competition to name the satellite.
They are asking for people to submit
name ideas, from which a shortlist
will be picked and then voted on.

asked about their willingness to
become legally responsible for the
Union, while candidates for Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies) debated
about how the Union interacts with
clubs. As part of this, the Union’s
decision to move a number of club
elections into the Big Elections was
hotly discussed.
Possibly the highlight of the
evening was with the discussion of
Union President, for this is felt to be
one of the most prestigious roles at
the Union.
Host Lim questioned the
candidates as to whether they would
live in Woodward Hall in North
Acton if they were to win next year –
sabbatical officers are allowed to live
in College accommodation free of
charge during their term. Candidate
Lucinda Sandon-Allum confirmed
that she would consider moving to
Woodward, while Luke Armitage said
he would not.

videos also available for each
position.
