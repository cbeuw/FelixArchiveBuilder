Jingjie Cheng explores the interaction between art and science
An Ode to Medicine, Mortality, and Art
In his poem Larynx, Pablo Neruda
implored of Death:
Why are you following me?
What do you want with my skeleton?...
Why do you have to take me?
What business have I with Heaven?
Hell doesn’t suit me –
I feel fine on the earth.”
The anxiety of the speaker upon
learning of a possible laryngeal
tumour – “a small seed of death” –
speaks for any patient who discovers
he has a serious illness. The fear,
denial, rage, the stubborn will to live
(“I wanted to be a cyclist | to pedal
out of death’s range”) reflects more
about human nature than it does
of the science of medicine itself: it
is the human nature which is about
standing up against trying times that
art so often attempts to capture.
Neruda, who is far better known
for his passionate love poetry than
ruminations on mortality, is only one
of thousands of artists and writers
who have based their creative works
on medicine and the art of healing.
Love and death, medicine and art,
are not greatly different after all –
history is replete with examples of
marriages between art and medicine,
from Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man to
Rembrandt’s famous painting of
The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicholaes
Tulp, now almost an icon of medical
education. Illness, struggle, healing,
and death make profound and
personal subject matter for creativity,
but there is also the simple aesthetic
appreciation of the human body
both in health and in illness – an
externalised observation of our
inherent vulnerability.
There is a Mandarin saying that
sums up life as “birth, age, illness,
and death”, painting a picture of life
as basically a gradual submission to
the forces of age and disease. Perhaps
it is this universality of sickness and
healing that makes medicine such a
popular inspiration for artists, more
so than any other profession. We all
understand it; we see it in our own
bodies, in the struggles of loved ones,
and in the work of doctors.
I picked up a book recently titled
The Sick Rose: Disease and the Art
of Medical Illustration, a display
of exquisite, unsettling drawings
of sickness from the Wellcome
Collection. Created in the time
before colour photography, most
of the drawings were done with the
purpose of educating physicians
of the past, rather than as creative
works. But any viewer would be able
to appreciate the skill that went into
them. To me, the crystallization of a
disease, something so dynamic, into
a particular representative drawing,
is creative interpretation in and
of itself. Call it perhaps a morbid
fascination, but I think the appeal of
these medical illustrations lie in an
innate drive to understand ourselves.
Looking at all the hair-raising
diseases staring almost too placidly
from the pages reminds me of how
impermanent health and youth is,
and how powerless our bodies are in
the face of such ravages.
Thus, in appreciating the aesthetics
of health, I find that there is beauty
in how basic chemical molecules
come together to form a sentient
being. Where there is beauty, there is
art. The New Objectivity movement
in photography, for example, focused
on capturing nature for its objective
beauty divorced from any sentiment.
Perhaps the aesthetics of the human
body holds similar sway.
Yet, despite its objective fascinating
qualities, in the past disease and the
human body make such attractive
artistic inspiration perhaps also
because of its unknowability. Disease
might have been represented as bad
spirits swirling around patients, or
demons trying to break free. Our
knowledge of disease increases by
the day and such representations,
far from dying out, simply become
metaphors. We can understand
perfectly that infections, poor diet,
or wayward cells cause disease, but
that doesn’t stop us from seeing
our ageing and weakening bodies
as an affliction on ourselves as a
whole rather than in the scientific
mechanisms of disease.
In a scathing criticism of the
medical profession’s obsession with
cutting things up and in the process
dehumanizing medicine, Dannie
Abse, a British physician-poet-
playwright himself, writes in his
poem X-ray :
Some prowl sea-beds, some hurtle to a
star
and, mother, some obsessed turn over
every stone
or open graves to let that starlight in.
There are men who would open anything.
Harvey, the circulation of the blood,
and Freud, the circulation of our dreams,
pried honourably and honoured are
like all explorers. Men who’d open men.
There is somehow a sanctity of the
human body that makes one averse
to breaking it all down, and it is this
wholeness that art captures. The nuts
and bolts of disease may very well be
left to science, but afflictions of the
body is more than that; it affects the
person, and that is the void that art
fills.
Medicine is so crucial to society;
it is also an institution, especially
in modern times. Thus, more than
just inspiring art on a personal level,
medicine and healthcare institutions
have also inspired social and political
commentary in art. What is disease?
What is madness? What is sanity? In
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Ken
Kesey questions what madness is,
criticising the medical profession’s
monopoly over its definition. Art
allows us to stand in the shoes of
others, and good art allows us to
understand different points of view
vividly – crucial in attacking the
status quo.
Last month, I caught Nina Raine’s
revival of her 2011 play Tiger Country
– a snapshot of life in the NHS
with everything that was wrong
thrown in. “Tiger country” refers
to dangerous situations in surgery
where the surgeon knows that a
slip would cause death. In the play,
the whole hospital is tiger country
for those trying to navigate it. As
a medical student, watching it was
utterly depressing, but I must admit
that it was a fantastic and timely
poking-of-holes in the NHS. Clearly,
theatre was a very immediate way of
provoking discussion on our over-
stretched healthcare system and the
working environment our healthcare
workers have to deal with.
I have never been able to decide
whether I am more of a “science
person” or an “arts person” – a
line people often like to draw – but
I think being able to appreciate
the relationship between the two
makes life a lot richer. Perhaps
medicine and disease make ripe
creative material precisely because it
straddles the middle ground between
the two worlds, a space of multiple
possibilities and fresh ideas. More
than that, I also think that it is our
undying obsession with our own
mortality that elicits such varied and
fascinating artistic exploration. I am
of the opinion that art actually has
something to contribute to our larger
understanding of medicine as a whole
as much as medicine provides for
artistic inspiration. After all, as the
ancient Greek physician Hippocrates
wrote, “Life is short, and art long”
– we will always be transient beings
despite the medical profession’s best
efforts, but art immortalizes this
very human struggle.
