THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 43
FELIX 06.03.2015
I’ll slit her fucking throat in broad
daylight.” You’ll probably agree,
there’s a tad less poetry to this than
the prose Underwood used to share
with the audience in seasons past.
It is also true that in this series
Frank’s straight-to camera
monologues are altogether less
grandiose than his early soliloquys.
Less wisdom is imparted and instead
Frank’s mood and opinions are
more commonly vented through
discussion with Thomas Yates (Paul
Sparks), the popular novelist who the
president entrusts with writing his
autobiography. Yates is an interesting
addition to the ensemble of conniving
politicians and his interactions with
the presidential couple give the series
some extra momentum and intrigue.
One of the greatest issues with House
of Cards is that the series does not
attempt to reveal anything about why
the Underwoods are so hell bent on
the acquisition of power, but Yates
begins to ask the questions that the
audience want to know about.
The latest episodes do a better job
than the second series of making
each plot strand equally attention
grabbing. Doug’s storyline is more
stimulating this time round and you
even take an interest in the guinea
pig wielding cyberterrorist. Despite
this, his departure from the show
would still be welcome, as to allow
the writers can distil House of Cards
down to the essence of what we
really care about: Frank, Claire, their
relationship and the presidency. In
that order.
Speaking of the relationship
between Frank and Claire, this is the
central theme that this series will
be remembered for. The cracks are
appearing as the pressure of high
office takes its toll on the couple and
the final episode leaves their delicate
relationship on a cliffhanger. There
is no doubt that this series puts to
bed one of the biggest issues with the
previous two series, which was that
"House
of Cards
never
reveals why
Underwood
is so hell
bent on
acquiring
power" Francis (Kevin Spacey) and Claire (Robin Wright), in House of Cards. They're probably

Frank seemed to be able to glide over
all problems with unrealistic ease.
Now he is noticeably more troubled
and has met worthy adversaries and
truly challenging obstacles. The
situation seems much more critical
than it did in the first 26 episodes, as
we are exposed to the ugly reality of
the American Presidency.
As with the previous series, there
is no shortage of ‘what the fuck?’
superficial shock factor moments that
House of Cards so regularly employed
during Frank’s rise to power. These
short scenes once again do nothing
for the overall storyline and come
across as a lazy attempt at character
development. Despite this, House of
cards is nothing if not confident in its
execution; the performances are first
rate and Spacey continues to own his
character with exacting standards,
while also subtly indicating the
monumental strain of high political
office.
This series marked a change
in the dynamic, and felt like a
more realistic representation of
Washington politics – a darker
West Wing. Frank’s formidable and
principled democratic opponents
also demonstrated an attempt to stop
painting all politicians with the same
brush. Sure, Frank’s evil. Sure, Claire’s
evil. But not all politicians are that
morally bankrupt.
Series three is slightly less addictive
to watch than the first two seasons,
probably because the chase is up and
now it is about staying in control.
There is still plenty of scheming, but
it is more reactive than proactive.
Nevertheless, series three is another
eleven hours of delicious drama that
doesn’t disappoint. It’s a bit of a slow
burner at first but becomes more nail
biting than ever as it crescendos to
the peak, with more than a whiff of
Shakespearean tragedy to it.
The two previous series set a high
bar and season three is doing a
remarkable job when you consider
the audacity of the project. After all,
what greater stage is there than the
Oval office?
