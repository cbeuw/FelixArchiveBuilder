Nefeli Maria Skoufou Papoutsaki asks whether the virus could be eradicated
Hope on the horizon for HIV
HIV (the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus)
is one of the most lethal
viruses. Since the first case in 1959,
39 million people have died from
HIV related diseases (including AIDS,
the disease caused by the virus, and
other co-infections such as Hepatitis
C). However, much progress has
been made in both the detection of
the disease and in developing some
potential treatments or vaccines.
There are also reasons to believe that
the virus will become less lethal in the
coming years.
The HIV virus targets the cells of
the immune system. More specifically
it targets the T cells, white blood cells
that have as a primary role to kill
infected cells and develop memory
cells that can be quickly formed if
the same virus/bacterium infects
the body again. The virus is sexually
transmitted and causes the widely
known disease AIDS. The final stage
of AIDS is the loss of immunity, so
patients can die even from a common
flu, this is why the HIV virus is
related with other co-infections.
Fortunately, leading researchers
are working on the HIV and AIDS
problem. One of the most important
discoveries was the understanding of
how HIV replicates. David Baltimore,
an American biologist, along with his
colleagues, discovered the enzyme
reverse transcriptase that can make
DNA from RNA, for which they won
the Nobel Prize for Physiology or
Medicine in 1975.
This is the enzyme that
retroviruses, such as HIV, use. They
do so because after entering a host
cell, they need to add their genetic
material into that of the host cell,
which is in the form of DNA. Many
antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) can
inhibit the replication of the virus,
now that the mechanism is known.
At the Conference on Retroviruses
and Opportunistic Infections (CROI),
which took place this February in
Seattle, many important research
findings were announced including
improvements on current treatments
as well as scientific breakthroughs.
Focus was given on the
improvements in care of both
AIDS and Hepatitis C, an infectious
disease affecting the liver. HIV-
positive people are also susceptible
to Hepatitis C due to common routes
of transmission, such as sexual
intercourse.
The relationship between the Ebola
outbreak and the effects on the HIV
treatment were also discussed. It
has been observed that in certain
hospitals in Africa, there is a 50%
drop in HIV testing, treatment and
entry into care, since doctors focus
more on the Ebola infection. This
may create the need, now more than
ever, for a simple and quick diagnosis
that people can even conduct on their
own.
Generally, when people are
diagnosed and under medical care
they are 94% less likely to transmit
the virus: something that underlines
the importance of an early diagnosis.
A group of researchers at Columbia
University have developed a low cost
smartphone accessory that can detect
in 15 minutes from a blood sample
whether the patient is HIV-positive or
whether he has syphilis. The next step
is to bring the accessory to developing
countries, after modifying it, since
most people there do not possess a
smartphone.
Concerning the treatment of HIV,
there is a substantial problem that
may have been overcome recently
by a group of researchers in the
University of California Technology:
why natural antibodies don’t work in
the treatment of HIV.
Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins
that attach to the surface of viruses in
the receptors or spikes they have in
order to destroy the viral cells. This
process is more effective when both
“arms” bind the spikes. In HIV cells
these spikes are fewer and in much
larger distance so the “arms” of the
antibodies cannot reach two spikes
at once.
What this group did was to develop
antibody based molecules that can
bind both their arms at a single spine.
The successful molecules managed
to neutralize the HIV 10-1,000 times
more effectively than the naturally
occurring antibodies.
Recently a drug candidate has been
observed that could be potentially
used as a vaccine for HIV, since it is
the most effective inhibitor found so
far. It can block every strain of HIV-1
and HIV-2 that has been isolated
from humans.
Another point of the HIV cycle
that is usually targeted by drugs is
to prevent the entry in the host cell.
This drug can bind to two points of
the HIV simultaneously to more
effectively prevent this entry. Also,
if an adeno-associated virus that can
easily be weakened is injected, it can
turn cells into factories that produce
this drug candidate that can last for
years; even decades.
As well as its effects on the immune
system, HIV can also have effects
on the brain. There are many HIV
associated neurocognitive disorders
(HANDs), usually found in patients
over 50 years old.
The virus prevents the cell from
clearing its damaged proteins, in
a process known as autophagy.
Disrupting autophagy can cause
the death of the cell when all these
damaged molecules accumulate in
high concentrations. The cancer drug
rapamycin that enhances autophagy
has been tested in HIV patients and
indeed reduced damage of neurons
was observed.
Hope is also seen on the horizon for
the HIV pandemic since the virus has
been found to evolve in less aggressive
forms in Africa. One reason for that
may be because of the wide use of the
HIV drugs which can decrease the
possibility of transmission.
Another reason for that may be that
the virus is evolving in a form that
would result in a slower infection so
that the hosts can survive for longer
and thus make it more likely for the
virus to be transmitted to others.
Although this is may not be the
case of the evolution of virus in the
Europe and the US, at least patients
there can benefit from all the other
advances in treatment and diagnosis
mentioned before, if all these actually
work in vivo.
