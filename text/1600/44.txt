Fred Fyles compares the different approaches FKA twigs and Sia take
when it comes to their controlling their public image in music videos
FKA twigs, Feminism, and
Female Sexuality on Video
Last month, in her debut at
London’s Roundhouse, British
auteur FKA twigs brought her
unique vision to a crowd of 3,000.
Entitled Congregata, a latin word for
‘gathering’, the two hour spectacle
saw twigs put her indomitable singing
and dancing talents to good use; she
vogued alongside a dancer in fishnet
stockings, was tossed up in the air
by burly men with topknots, and
changed outfits whilst contortionists
kept the crowd entertained. It’s a far
cry from her London debut, which
took place at Hoxton’s Courtyard
Theatre, a little less than a year ago,
in front of an audience of just over
100. While at the Roundhouse she
was front and centre, at the Courtyard
she was kept shielded from the
audience by a swirling mist, through
which you could make out the petite
figure who has become one of the
most important voices in the British
music industry. What was kept
constant between the gigs, however,
was her sheer gratitude at being able
to perform; at the end of Congregata,
twigs breaks character, telling the
audience in a breathy voice that can
barely contain its excitement how
happy she is to be there. As if any
other outcome were possible.
As twigs has become more and
more popular, her presence in our
visual landscape has become nearly
inescapable; if you don’t spot her
staring you down on the Summer
2014 issue of Dazed Magazine,
her backcombed hair making her
look like she’s been plugged into
an electrical socket, you’ll see
her looking out at you on a tube
advert, a crimson mark covering,
like some form of stigmata, a face
photoshopped to look like porcelain.
Of course, with her relationship
with Robert Pattinson nearing the
6-month mark, you are even sure
to find her gracing the Daily Mail’s
‘Sidebar of Shame’ every now and
then.
While such visibility seems
near-inevitable in our social media,
instagram-as-verb, post-panoptic
world, Australian singer Sia has
managed to take a different approach;
while acknowledging that promoting
her sixth album 1000 Forms of Fear
necessitates the required media
circuit of performances, photoshoots,
and interviews, she has remained
wilfully – and delightfully – obtuse in
how she chooses to present herself. In
what could be described as a publicity
stunt, but really deserves the title
of performance art, Sia has refused
to show her face whilst performing
for the last year. Instead, she has
put the spotlight on Maddie Siegler,
a 12-year-old dance prodigy from
the TV series Dance Moms; Siegler
takes centre stage alongside a range
of celebrity cameos, from Lena
Dunham to Kristen Wiig, while Sia
turns away from the audience, her
shoulderblades shuddering as she
exercises her fearsome vocals. Like
anything on the internet, if you want
to see her face that much you can
google it, but Sia’s damn sure not
going to present herself up to you
willingly.
Siegler has become some sort of
an avatar for Sia, the precocious
preteen presented as a public face
for Sia’s music. In the video for
‘Chandelier’, Siegler flings herself
around a dilapidated apartment,
twisting and contorting her face into
"While such
visibility
seems near-
inevitable,
singer
Sia has
managed a
different
approach"

gruesome configurations, while in
‘Elastic Heart’ she dance-fights with
Shia LaBeouf in a giant cage. Instead
of presenting herself as a visual
object, Sia subverts the audience’s
expectation, delivering instead a
piece of carefully choreographed
performance art. What makes her
decision – prompted, she says, by a
desire “to not be famous” – all the
more interesting is the fact that for all
previous albums she has done she has
shown her face quite willingly. You
only have to go about halfway down
the first page of YouTube results that
pop up when you search ‘Sia’ to find
her face: a video of a 2007 SXSW
performance in which she addresses
the audience head on, telling them
in an excited voice that they were
“radical”. So what changed? Perhaps
the songwriting interval between her
fifth and sixth albums, during which
time she penned ‘Pretty Hurts’ for
Beyonce and ‘Diamonds’ for Rihanna,
gave her the opportunity to get used
to eschewing the limelight.
In terms of music videos, twigs
seems to stand in direct contradiction
to Sia; while Sia’s rise to fame has
led to her shielding herself from
the public, as twigs has become
increasingly popular, she has chosen
to reveal herself more and more. In
‘Hide’, for example, one of the first
singles from her excellent debut EP1,
she is only visible from shoulders to
knees; wiggling around to the beat
of the song, she tenderly caresses
an anthurium, clasped between her
thighs, whose phallic spadix thrusts
upwards. Even when she first decided
to reveal herself to the world, she
used technical trickery to add an
uncanny valley element to her image;
on the cover of EP2, her neck is
subtly lengthened, and in the video
for ‘Water Me’, the lead single from
that release, twigs’ already wide eyes
are enlarged, until she resembles
something not-quite human.
As time has gone on, it seems that
twigs has become more comfortable
with revealing herself: covered
in glitter, she is simultaneously
strangled and caressed in her video
for ‘Papi Pacify’; sitting upon a
throne like an ancient Egyptian
goddess, she is surrounded by an
army of mini-twigs who krump and
"FKA twigs'
video for
Pendulum
is erotic,
sensual, and
achingly
beautiful"
