This article comes with a health
warning. We will be discussing
EU legislation and, as with all
things EU, there will be a wealth of
unhelpful acronyms and terminology
fired at you, none more so than
those forming the Commission’s
new ‘Energy Union Strategic
Framework’, officially revealed last
Wednesday. Briefly speaking, this
hugely ambitious plan intends to
unite gas and electricity markets in
the different regions of Europe and,
eventually, Europe as a whole whilst
facilitating the growth of renewables
at the same time.
It must be said that the process
of integration is complex, from
physically connecting all countries
together with big cables, to wading
through the minutiae of new trading
rules and regulations that will have
to be implemented. But this process,
a once in a generation infrastructure
upgrade, is also fascinating. I will
spare you every tiny detail; I don’t
know half them myself. But I will
pick up on one particular morsel
of policy: that of the obscure, but
rather wonderful Flow-Based Market
Coupling (FBMC – acronym number
1).
Coupling Countries
First, let’s put this all into context,
one of the cornerstones of the
Commission’s Energy Union is
the idea of ‘price convergence’ via
market ‘coupling’ between countries
– essentially making sure electricity
prices being traded across borders
are the same or very similar. To
achieve this you can do two things:
build more interconnecting cables
and manage those interconnections
better. The first option is, for the
purposes of this article, relatively
straightforward. Build more cables
between countries and you can
trade more electricity back and
forth, meaning you get closer to an
equilibrium price in both countries.
In Germany and France for example,
wholesale electricity prices were the
same 67% of the time in 2011.
But how do you pursue option
two and go about managing
interconnections better? More
importantly, what is so problematic
that it requires management to be
better in the first place? When you
want electricity, doesn’t it just flow
through the cables without a hitch?
Well not exactly.
Loop Flow
It is true that electricity will always
flow along a cable. But if you have a
lot of those cables in your network,
it may not flow exactly where you
want it to go, choosing the path of
least resistance over a ‘busy’ line.
This phenomenon in the networks is
referred to as a ‘loop flow’.
Somewhat unhelpfully, loop flows
are sensitive to the variability of solar
and wind generation, where the more
renewables that come onto the grid
the more likely it is these loop flows
will occur. This is because if a grid
operator is forecasting anticipated
demand for the day ahead, the real-
time situation on that actual day may
be quite different if, say, the wind
blows more than expected.
If the day-ahead prediction
is indeed inaccurate, the extra
electricity generated can ‘flood’
transmission lines in neighbouring
countries that might be less
congested. Since the bulk of market
trading occurs within national
borders or cross-border markets
that do not correspond with the
transmission lines through which
this electricity may travel, these
forecasting errors can create price
imbalances within and between
countries.
From an EU perspective, this is
potentially disastrous as it drives a
wedge between the Commission’s
work on market integration and
their push for renewable growth,
two things which the Energy Union
Strategy would dearly like to see as
compatible. Yet it does not matter
how well designed your market
system is, you cannot tell electrons
to follow price signals if they have a
perfectly free transmission line to go
down.
Going in the Wrong
Direction
To highlight the problem, between
2011-2012, according to Thema
Consulting, out of all of the
electricity flowing between Germany
and the Netherlands, some of it was
physically flowing in the opposite
direction to its destination 74% of
the time. Between Switzerland and
France, this happened 95.5% of the
time. Whilst the quantity of energy
wasted in these cases varies, with
renewable growth being promoted

countries (e.g. Feed-in Tariffs in
Germany) the situation is only likely
to get worse.
It is in this light that FBMC
becomes so critical. In very brief
terms, FBMC replaces the old notion
that Available Transfer Capacity
(ATC) should be calculated separately
to the price at which electricity is
traded. In this way there is a much
closer alignment between the
direction of prices in the market and
the direction of the electricity across
the cable itself. As such, through
clever algorithms that I will not even
begin to unveil (or understand) in
this article, FBMC is even able to
manipulate the flow of electricity to
suit those market prices.
Through such a method, the IEA
predicts that price convergence
within the Central Western European
(CWE) region could increase from
58% to 90%. Researchers have even
gone further, to suggest that if by
2050 FBMC is not fully implemented,
the EU could end up paying €590
billion more than it would need to.
Plain or Intuitive?
FBMC is not without its demons. In
some circumstances, the algorithm
on which FBMC is based can end up
sending electricity from a high price
area to a low price area in order to
maximise overall welfare across a
region. As a response to this, there is
currently a great deal of discussion
within the CWE region regarding
whether or not FBMC should be
‘plain’ or ‘intuitive’.
In the latter instance, rules would be
set such that prices would always flow
from low to high across borders, but
recognising that there may be a loss
in overall welfare. Ultimately, FBMC
is problematic if only because of just
how complicated it is. Having first
been proposed and agreed by grid
operators in 2007, it is only now being
approved as we speak. Assuming no
further delay, FBMC is expected to
be implemented in CWE in ‘early
2015’. The computational ICT needs,
depending on the scale of future
implementation, are astronomical.
Smart Grids
When people talk about ‘smart grids’,
I often find myself struggling to
describe exactly what one might look
like, let alone what the technologies
involved might be. With FBMC
though, the notion that electricity
can be controlled by a computer,
sent in different directions all across
different borders, and produce lower
prices as a result certainly seems very
smart.
Even better from the Commission’s
perspective, FBMC is exactly the sort
of methodology that could adapt to
the variability of renewables as their
proportion of generation throughout
the EU increases and the movement
away from fossil fuels combustion for
energy production commences. Of
course, as with most EU ‘packages’,
FBMC will be just one of a number
of complicated reforms in the grand
Energy Union plan.
But when we paint a picture of the
future of Europe’s grids, it just might
be the smartest.
