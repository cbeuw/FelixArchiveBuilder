Vo
Fact: I am faster than 80% of all
snakes.
Whenever I’m about to do
something I think ‘would an idiot do
that?’ and if they would, I do not do
that thing.
How would I describe myself?
Three words: Hard-working;
Alpha Male; Jackhammer; Merciless;
Insatiable.
But that’s enough about me.
Fact: There is not enough Cider
Union President
on campus. No crofters to be seen
anywhere.
Fact: Nobody has ever been into
university on a Thursday. Therefore
removal of all contact hours on
Thursday.
Fact: There is not enough Snooker
on campus screens.
Fact: There are still no dip-dabs.
Fact: Nowhere on campus can I buy
Beets.
Question: What are we going to do
about this?
Answer: Vote for me to find out.
Fact: Beer cost the union 68 pence
per pint to purchase. Therefore sell all
pints for 70 pence.
Fact: Ronnie O’Sullivan has never
visited Imperial.
Fact: Cider makes things less
boring. Therefore the union will
supply free cider to council meetings.
Fact: Transparency.
Literally the best.

Undeniably winning the election.
Kills all other competition.
Extremely the best.
Your time at Imperial should be that
of a versatile world-class institution.
However, 29% of you feel the Union
is not the voice for students; I can
be the one to change that, as the
platform for representation of all
students.
I’ve been fully involved in
the Union throughout my 3
years studying Biology. I have
gained insights, knowledge and
understanding of a diverse group of
students, through my experience as
RCSU Vice-President (Activities),
Netball club member and 2 years in
the RAG committee.
My main aims:
- Ensure students feel supported by
the Union.
- Increase the ease of access to
Union services and activities for all
students.
- Greater student engagement.
- Strengthen the student
community.
To achieve these aims, I will:
- Introduce ‘work weeks’ and skills
workshops, allowing for informed
career choices and successful
applications.
- ‘Find a Sponsor’ event for Clubs,
Societies and Projects; ensuring equal
and enhanced opportunities for IC
and ICSM CSPs to obtain funding.
- Amplify the support for the
setting-up of new societies and the
running of student-led campaigns.
- Greater transparency and
communication of matters that affect
us, by implementing a consultation
platform for students to express their
views, before decisions are made.
- ‘Recommend a House’ scheme to
make the process of ‘house hunting’
easier.
- Bring together Imperial’s diversity
at an annual ‘Celebration of Culture’
evening.
- Strengthen communities within
Imperial through integrated
undergraduate/postgraduate events.

If you want me to be YOUR voice,
make me YOUR choice.
I’m currently the treasurer of the
Recreational Clubs Committee (RCC),
and look after the finances of over
45 clubs, with a combined turnover
of £420,000. I’ve supported the
creation of dozens of clubs this year
as a member of the New Activities
Committee.
I’ve also worked at the Union bar
and the Union reception, so I have a
great working knowledge of how our
Union operates.
Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)
And, of course, I am a member of a
whole host of clubs too! I am heavily
involved in Pole Dancing, Musical
Theatre, Cheerleading and Felix, as
the editor of the Clubs and Societies
pages, so I have a wide spread of
experience and ideas.
I want to:
- improve support for new clubs
and committees by adding to training
for club and society volunteers and
committing to regular cross-campus
check-ins on what clubs are up to.
- make people approachable; I
believe sabbs should spend at least a
day a week available to students. I’ll
also move my office in with the rest
of the student activities team.
- form a focus group of students to
see how we’re doing on a regular basis.
Students tell me they don’t know how
to tell the Union there’s a problem,
and I aim to fix that.
- commit to making C&S activity
in Acton and on other campuses a
reality.
I love promoting and celebrating
the amazing things clubs and societies
do, making me a perfect candidate
to represent your views, full time, as
DPCS next year.

Union President Lucinda Sandon-Allum
Hi, I’m Issie. I’m a third year studying
biology, but I think you’ll agree
there’s a lot more to university than
academia…
From speed skating for Imperial to
posing naked for Felix with nothing
but a saxophone, I have become well
and truly integrated in clubs and
societies. I believe extra-curriculars
are vital to people’s welfare, happiness
and success at university, so I want
them to be the best they can be.
With me as your deputy president
Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)
- Continue the fight to protect
training grounds.
- Encourage inter-society events.
I am keen to interact with you
directly to solve any issues that arise,
and will fight for what I believe is best
for you!
For more details of my manifesto
visit www.challengethecarrot.co.uk
you would be in safe hands:
- This year I am chair of IC Big
Band, also sitting on the Arts &
Entertainments board.
- I am current director and
founding member of Take Note a
cappella group, and tour organiser of
A Cappella society.
- I have held Skate Society
committee positions over the past two
years.
I have experience running
societies from bottom to top, and
understand the issues that concern
clubs of different types and sizes. No
matter how big or small, social or
competitive, your club matters!
As DPCS I would:
- Support smaller clubs and
societies.
- Continue the review and overhaul
of management boards.
- Review and encourage an overhaul
of room booking systems.
- Review and adjust eActivities to
improve accessibility.
