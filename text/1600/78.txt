Council Chair Alexander Mytenka
My name is Alex Mytenka and I am
currently a third year Earth Scientist
in the RSM. I am a running for
council chair because I have a passion
to help others and aspire to make a
difference to university life.
I have an excellent track record
of success, achievement and
determination to be the best.
I have demonstrated these traits
both academically and outside of my
studies: I am currently ESE 3rd
year
representative, as well as being the
former assistant station manager
of ICV and secretary of the Media
group. Other past experiences include
being a vital member of a disability
councillor team at an American
summer camp, and 15 years as master
of ceremonies at my local parish.
These all emphasise my confident
leadership, commitment, flexibility,
responsibility, ability to be a crucial
team player, and ability to thrive in
new situations.
I am confident I can make an
instant impact in this role and will
ensure that each policy brought
forward are considered in depth and
every voice listened to. I will ensure
that the executive branch are held
accountable at all times and that they
fulfil their election promises.
I accept the challenges that this
role will require me to face, and will
act accordingly and to the best of my
ability for the best of the union.
As an RSM member I know what
change and progress looks like. I
believe this gives me an edge to lead
this council successfully into the
future.
Council Chair Jasper Menkus
Since the beginning of this
academic year, I have served on
Council as an Ordinary Member.
You may not know much about
Council, but its proceedings affect
all of you who are reading this. So
far this year, we have set the rent
ratio between Acton and South Ken
halls, reduced the price of feminine
hygiene supplies in the Union shop,
kept the sabbatical officers in line,
and changed our own voting rules to
make Council more transparent.
We have also formulated ‘official’
Union positions on issues as diverse
as tuition fees, the Counterterrorism
and Security Bill, fossil fuel
divestment and ethical investment,
postgraduate experience, and bursary
funding. Many of these proposals
were brought to Council not by Sabbs
or Council members, but by ordinary
students.
At the heart of an effective Council
is an efficient and impartial Chair:
someone who is familiar with the
Union ecosystem, someone who
wants to ensure that everybody has
their voice heard. I believe that I am
that person. From two years serving
on various committees (and two
terms on Council) I have the skills
and experience necessary to navigate
the turbid bureaucratic waters of
the Union, and the commitment to
ensure that Council reaches its full
potential next year.
If elected, I will encourage a
greater variety of students to
submit papers to Council. I will also
strive to improve communication
between Council members and the
communities that they represent,
which has been lacking of late.
Vote experience. Vote dedication.
Vote Menkus.
Council Chair Richard Cameron
I have been involved with the
Union for 4 years now (first as an
undergrad, and now doing my PhD in
the Physics department). I currently
sit on the Union Council and chair
the Recreational Clubs Committee, a
group of around 45 clubs & societies
in the Union with over 2,600
members.
This requires me to help with the
running of RCC clubs and to liaise
between them and the Union, as well
as chairing regular meetings of the
RCC to keep the clubs up to date with
happenings in the Union.
In addition, this role has required
me to sit on both the Union Council
and the Clubs, Societies, & Projects
Board – the panel governing all clubs
at Imperial – as well as a variety of
other Union and College committees.
While Council is quite removed
from the student-facing side of the
Union, it makes many of the most
important decisions for the student
body, from overseeing the sabbatical
officers to even setting rents in halls
next year. As the Council Chair also
sits on the Union’s Board of Trustees,
taking on this position is a huge
responsibility.
Having experience of chairing a
large group within the Union, as
well as experience on Council itself, I
believe I would perform this role well.
If elected, I would simply promise
to chair Council meetings impartially
and responsibly, for the benefit of
students, and to welcome input from
across the student body in my role as
a Trustee for the Union.
