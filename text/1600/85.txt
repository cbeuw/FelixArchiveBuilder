THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 85
FELIX 06.03.2015
Hangman can reveal that the
bid to take over the best study
spots in Imperial College
Library has officially begun, as hoards
of broken stationary, dummy notes
and sometimes empty sport bags are
being left strewn across desks.
The disarray of junk began
appearing earlier this term as mid
term exams took place. With many
students saying it can take years to
find the ultimate library study spot,
it is no wonder that those who find
academic nirvana within the confines
of the library are doing anything they
can to hold onto it.
The first spots to be claimed
were the coveted window seats on
the silent level 2, highly regarded
due to the ambient temperature,
the view over Queens Lawn (albeit
slightly tinted) and the lack of noise.
These spots are perfect for intense
revision periods, and, being close
enough to the library café, are
great for rehydration and energy
replenishment.
Old Casio calculators, empty
ring binders and the odd biro were
reported to have appeared on these
as early as last month.
The second spots to slowly
disappear were the single study
spaces in the Wolfson Suite in the
first floor, favoured for those that
prefer studying into the night and
many final year biology students
who have taken to living in the
library before exams. Spots nearest
the window were claimed nearly a
fortnight ago, coveted because when
the sun rises, the light hits these
chairs and tables first.
This is considered especially
advantageous for those that are
night owls and are unlikely to come
into contact with direct sunlight
unless they prefer to cycle home
midmorning.
The latest spots claimed from
now until the end of the year are the
group study rooms also on the first
Who should be the next Union President? You decide!
Lucinda’s flowing blonde locks
can only do her favours in her run
for Presidency.Insiders say she
conditions twice,and blowdries,
but never straightens her perfect
flowing mane.She also dips the
ends in coconut oil. Fruity!
Luke has slightly shorter locks,and
rumours have it he uses the classic
conditioning technique of bathing
his bangs in beer fortnightly,giving
them a slightly fizzy yet soft feel.
The rumours he then sucks the tips
dry are unsubstantiated.Gassy!
Boris is the unlikely candidate for
this year’s Union President,but it
is well documented that he only
shampoos (using Johnson’s own
shampoo,obviously) then lets his
locks dry naturally as he cycles to
the Town Hall.Athletic!
Tilda Swinton dips her jagged tips
in ice cold water every morning for
three minutes,before towel drying
and taking to the road.This ice
treatment toughens Tilda up for a
day of campaigning hard in the JCR.
Democratic!
Taylor Swift is a big fan of pure
eucalyptus oil,squeezed directly
from a cactus.She then“shakes
it off”before blow drying and
styling.Look out for this blonde bob
handing out fliers on the walkway.
Mainstream!
Students become territorial over library spots as
exam season nears
floor that are now being occupied in
shifts. Hangman spoke to one of the
students present, who explained how
him and his housemate are taking
turns to use the spot, as one prefers
to work early in the morning and the
other works throughout the night.
“Although we live together,
I actually only see him during
library handover. Our flat back in
Hammersmith is a state and all our
house plants we stole from halls in
first year have died, but at least we
are now averaging a 2.1.”
Spots that are still up for grabs
include most of those on fourth floor
(unless near a fan) and the entirety of
fifth floor, as medical students don’t
start working until the beginning of
Easter. It is expected that these too
will be claimed by the beginning of
May at the latest, so it is advisable
those who “Just can’t work at home,”
start staking out their spot now.
