GSU President Patrick Naccour
Since falling head over heels in
love with the RSM in my first year,
I have spent this year fulfilling
two committee positions. As Tour
Secretary for RSM Hockey, I have
been involved in all major decisions
and every day running of the club.
I have also played a key role in
establishing RSM Netball, and have
recently been made Social Secretary.
The strong bonds linking the
RSM community are founded
through outstanding participation
in DepSoc, Sports Club and RSMU
activities and events. I intend to
ensure our activities and events
remain illustrious and inclusive to
all. I will make certain all events are
thoroughly publicized to Materials
and ESE, especially promoting the
Hill Cup to encourage interaction
between departments.
The prolific history of the RSM
is part of what makes it so special.
The RSMA provides a vast network
of alumni, with wonderful stories
and invaluable advice. If elected
President, I will work hard to
continue strong links with the RSMA
and look in to holding new events
with them.
This year has seen the RSMU
come under the watchful eye of the
RSMU President Madeline Hann
During my three years at the RSM I
have experience sitting on a number
of committees. This year as president
of Geophysics Society I successfully
put in place a significant number
changes; I more than doubled the
attendance of talks and socials and
planned the upcoming Mount Etna
Tour. This position has also allowed
me to become a vocal member of the
RSMU committee enabling me to
obtain a strong understanding of the
workings within the RSM. Last year
as sponsorship officer for the DLB I
raised £400 from Premier Oil for the
autumn tour. The experience I have
acquired through these positions
stand me in excellent stead for the
role of RSM president.
My main polices are:
• Increase attendance to RSM
socials through the combination
of newer events with the current
favourites.
• Increase the involvement
and identity of the DepSocs and
sports teams within RSM life through
the co-hosting of events, such as bar
nights, between the RSM committee
and a DepSoc or sports team.
• Ensure the minutes of
all future RSM executive meetings
are public, by posting them on the
RSM Facebook group, ensuring the
decisions made within the RSMU are
made with transparency and allow all
RSMU President Matthew Wetton
The RSM has made a huge
impression on me over the past
three years, not only academically
but socially too. By listening to our
students, each year’s committee
ensures that they keep the RSM
such a friendly place. Having sat on
the committee as Pit and Publicity
Officer I have seen great progression
this year in the RSM. I played an
integral role in organising The
Bottle Match to guarantee the day
went smoothly. I also worked hard
with Jan Cilliers and Neil Alford to
make The Pit more inclusive and
accessible so that it fell in line with
the interests of the college at the same
time as representing the students.
We even held Freshers’ Dinner at the
Rembrandt Hotel with no mishaps!
I wish to continue to show ICU that
the RSM can maintain its fantastic
traditions problem-free, whilst
embracing new ideas such as Tri-
union bar night.
I hope to continue the increased
attendance by Materials and ESE
students we have seen this year, so
that eventually the RSM will become
more cohesive and inclusive of all
of its students. I would also like to
work closely with the RSMA to host
a networking day for all students, in
the hope of furthering our options
after education.
I have developed a clear
RSMU President Samuel Argyle
union. I aim to ensure the RSM runs
smoothly and unscathed through
these challenging times. As President,
I would sit on a number of ICU
committees presenting your views
and upholding the reputation of the
RSMU. I am ideally suited to this as I
have the ability to be calm and listen
in high pressure situations, whilst
keeping the RSM firmly in my head
and heart.
within the RSM to see what events are
ahead.
• To be approachable and
welcoming to all within the RSM.
Thank you for taking the time to
consider me and I hope that you will
trust me to maintain the excellent
standard we have all grown accustom
to.

understanding of how the RSM
functions as a community and I am
certain I can drive the RSM in the
direction it needs to be led to keep it
such an incredible place.
