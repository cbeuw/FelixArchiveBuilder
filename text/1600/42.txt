Joshua Renken gives a brief overview of the latest 13-episode instalment
of the hit US web television series. In short: less sex, more politics
House Of Cards Series 3:
Worth the wait, worth your
weekend
Warning: this review contains spoilers
After a year of waiting, the
much anticipated third series
of House of Cards has finally
reared its head. The 13-episode
season was uploaded to Netflix at
08:00 last Friday, and no doubt
millions of people decided to spend
their weekends binging on the web
television.
This new series was always going
to be rather different to the previous
two, because Frank’s position has
fundamentally changed. Before
the end of the last series he was
constantly on the offensive, fighting
tooth and nail to take down Walker
and snatch the top spot for himself.
But now that Frank and Claire have
achieved what they set out to do, it is
now a case of maintaining the power
and winning popular support with a
view to the upcoming 2016 election.
This new season picks up three
months after Frank’s swearing-in as
president, with less than two years
before the next election; since Frank
was never voted in by the public it
will be an uphill struggle to make
his short time in office count so that
he has something to present to the
American electorate come poll time.
Frank’s big policy is the ‘America
Works’ job programme that will
spend $500 billion to find jobs for
every single able-bodied person in
the country. Mr and Mrs Underwood
are acutely aware that public image is
everything, and they must focus their
efforts on quashing the campaigns
of other democratic presidential
candidates – it’s not paranoia if they
really are out to get you.
It may sound like a strange
comment to make about House of
Cards, but this new series is very,
very political, with strong parallels
between the political landscape in
series three and what is going on
today. The politics extends beyond
domestic policy and reaches as far as
Russia and the Middle East. President
Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen), effectively
a carbon copy of Vladimir Putin,
mirrors the situation we see today;
they discuss actual events such as
rising Middle East tensions and the
Pussy Riot protests, while creating
a fictional gay rights activist whom
Carrie is trying to get released in
Russia. These meetings between
Underwood and Petrov are the most

thrilling in the series, and means that
House of Cards has a very real-world
sting in its tail.
One of the starkest differences in
this series is the frequency with which
Frank swears. This might seem like
a small detail, but it makes a real
impact in the dialogue. Most of the
swearing is delivered within a threat
or in one of Frank’s angrier fourth
wall breaking monologues.
In one tense discussion with
another democratic presidential
candidate, Frank ends a phone call
with this splendid bit of prose: “I
have only one thing to say: go fuck
yourself.” He then turns to the
camera and explains “Christ that felt
good”. In the next monologue, Frank
declares that his opponent “can go
after me but if she goes after Claire
