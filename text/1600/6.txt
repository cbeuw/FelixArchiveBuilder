The only pre-election debate
on higher education that
features key representatives
from all of the three main parties in
Westminster took place on the 2nd
March.
The event, which was chaired
by Open University Chancellor
Baroness Lane-Fox and hosted by
Times Higher Education, the Higher
Education Policy Institute, the Open
University and Universities UK, put
questions to the panel consisting
of Liam Byrne (Labour shadow
minister for universities, science
and skills), Julian Huppert (Lib
Dem science spokesman) and Greg
Clark (Conservative minister for
universities, science and cities).
Labour’s pledge to reduce tuition
fees to £6000 was the biggest talking
point in the 90-minute discussion,
but other issues such as free speech
in Universities and overseas students
Election hustings debate tackles education
were reviewed.
In the election hustings debate
Liam Byrne confirmed that Ed
Miliband and Labour still see a
graduate tax as the right “long-term”
policy for university funding despite
announcing £6,000 fees as their
short-term goal.
Mr Byrne said “I don’t think
the Liberal Democrats or the
Conservatives have said definitely
that fees will not rise in the next
Parliament.”
The shadow minister asserted
“although we can’t promise free
education over the course of the next
Parliament, we do think the right
long-term shift is to a graduate tax.”
He added: “I know that there are
many people in the higher education
sector who would like the current
system to stay. But I have to say to
you it would be criminally naïve to
ignore the time bomb that’s about to
go off.”
Mr Byrne attacked the status quo,
claiming that the current £9,000
student loans system would result
in £280 billion being added to the
national debt by 2030.
Mr Clark accused Labour of
adopting an “unprogressive” policy
and told the audience that the
Institute for Fiscal Studies had said of
Labour’s £6,000 policy that it “would
benefit the highest earning graduates
when they are in their 40s” and “put
universities back on the dependence
of an annual handout from the
Treasury”.
The minster said: “I’m sorry that we
have ended up with a disagreement…
because I do think universities have
benefitted from the confidence and
stability that’s come from the fees
system.”
Mr Huppert declared that
ultimately he would like fees to be
abolished but admitted, “I simply
don’t know how to get funding for
that” and wouldn’t want the taxpayer
to pay for higher learning in full “if
it meant destroying the quality of
education”.
The Lib Dem science spokesman
argued that the best allocation of the
money would be to “put it towards the
cost of living for students…that is the
thing that will get rid of the barriers
students actually face”.
Criticising Labour’s £6,000 policy,
Mr Huppert said: “The money
that is available, I would not use it
preferentially to help students who
will go on to make lots of money. I
would use it to help students at the
same time they need it.”
The panel also discussed the
introduction of postgraduate loans.
Huppert explained that: “I did
quite a lot of work with NUS and all
sorts of others to argue the case for
income contingent loans for graduate
funding, and we got the first tranche
of that in the autumn statement.”
However these postgraduate loans
are not currently available for
anyone over 30 years of age. Huppert
reiterated that it “should only be a
first step” and that if the loan system
works well the programme should be
expanded.
Although he conceded that “you
may have to find a way to adjust the
repayment process.”
It is clear that higher education is
going to be a central element of this
year’s election campaign and this
hustings debate helped to clarify the
positions of the three major parties.
