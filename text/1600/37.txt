Have you always been into fashion?
As a child I always felt
uncomfortable about my body and
out of place and hid underneath
baggy t-shirts and sportswear.As
soon as I could afford to,I started
experimenting with clothing and
found it helped me express myself.
Throughout school and university
my style was always very eccentric
and colourful,and my goal was to
enjoy clothing as much as I could,
never fearing shapes or colours.
What inspired you to start posting
your outfits online?
I started using tumblr in 2011; I was
in the final year of my photography
degree and had a big collection
of images that I had saved for
inspiration: tumblr seemed like the
ideal outlet for me to share these
and discover more.I slowly stumbled
upon the fashion side,promoting
body positivity and it was everything
I needed but hadn’t realised! I had
spent my earlier years reading Elle
avidly and never seeing anybody
that looked like me; looking at
people online now who had the
same body type experimenting
with clothing opened up my eyes,
and gave me a wonderful sense of
belonging and identity.
Why do you think it’s important to
see plus-size models represented?
I think representation is a crucial
thing.It was so overwhelming for
me to see people who look like me
enjoying fashion and celebrating
their appearance,because I
had never seen that before and
previously felt isolated as a fat
woman who loved clothes.I think
the media should aim to represent
all sizes,races and genders,so that
people who may feel isolated with
their appearance or identity can see
others that look like them and feel a
sense of belonging and pride.
How do you feel about the
negativity that many plus-size
models face?
I find it incredibly disheartening,
considering all they are trying to
do is promote beauty in diversity.I
think it’s important to try and rise
quirky clothing in those sizes.
Evans have some exciting items on
their website,but their stores are
very plain and safe.I don’t want a
wrap dress or an oversized t-shirt
emblazoned with the word Diva!
Fat people want to look good,if
you push the boundaries with your
clothing we will come and buy it–
you only have to look at Gabifresh’s
sellout plus-size bikini line to see!
Why do you think that there’s a lot
less out there for plus-size men?
This isn’t something I had realised
until recently,I’m not sure whether
it’s because fashion isn’t as
orientated towards men or whether
men are surprisingly self-conscious
about accepting their bodies and
enjoying clothing...either way,I
think larger men should have more
options of expression and shouldn’t
be afraid to embrace fashion!
What are your aims as a plus-size
blogger?
To promote happiness,positivity,
and love to people of all sizes,races,
and genders and to help spread the
message that everyone is deserving
of respect,love and nice clothing!
above it,though,as personally I try
to promote happiness and positivity
and be a supportive person to
people of all sizes.If somebody else
feels their purpose in life is to tear
others down,I would ask that person
to examine why and to understand
that it won’t help them.
Where do you like to shop?
My ultimate favourite retailer is Asos
Curve.Their sizes are accurate,and
they are bold and fashionable whilst
still being affordable.I get very
frustrated being told that I should
only wear certain styles because I’m
fat,and I feel like Asos Curve agree
with me! I like Simply Be and New
Look Inspire although they can be
a bit hit and miss with sizing.I also
wear larger sizes from brands such
as H&M,Primark,Tesco and Asda.
Sizes vary so much from store to
store so I think sometimes it’s just
important to try things on and give
it a go!
Is it difficult to shop for plus-size
clothes on the high street?
It really is.A lot of stores stop at
UK 16,and even stores that stock
18 or 20 often don’t stock their
An interview with plus-size fashion
blogger, Natashia Judge
Callie Thorpe is a blogger from

plus-size women, and writes about
her journey to body acceptance. She

Times, and has even participated in
a television debate with Channel
Four’s Jon Snow.

Chastity Garner is a plus-size blogger
from Georgia, who blogs about
her fashion inspiration and gives
style advice. She started an online
campaign against the clothing chain,
Target, as she felt that plus-size
women were treated as second-class
customers. Following this, Target
expanded their plus-size ranges
significantly, one of which Chastity
now models. She has been interviewed
by Vogue Italia in a blog featuring
some of her best looks. She promotes
plus-size fashion to create demand to
drive the industry towards change.
a larger woman.Plus-size women
can enjoy fashion,but in the
knowledge that these clothes are
specifically“not for them”.
But although it’s still rare,plus-
size women are beginning to be
featured in magazines such as
Vogue,and plus-size fashion weeks
are springing up all over the world.
It’s a case of changing attitudes
towards fat women,and people in
general.When everyone,be they
plus-size,disabled,transgender,
or anything that they identify as,is
seen to be as worthy of nice clothes
as the waifs that traditionally
grace runways,then the world of
fashion will be truly inclusive and
representative,as it ought to be.
