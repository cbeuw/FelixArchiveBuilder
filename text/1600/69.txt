Kamil McClelland reviews Peter Sellars’ contemporary take on a classic
The Indian Queen — Purcell’s Final Flourish
To call this production of The
Indian Queen at the ENO
Purcell’s opera might be seen
as unfaithful to the extent to which
Peter Sellars has reinvented the work.
First performed in 1695 only a short
walk away at Theatre Royal in Drury
Lane, The Indian Queen was Henry
Purcell’s final work, for he was to pass
away tragically prematurely later that
year. Based on a libretto of the same
name written thirty years previously
by John Dryden, Purcell was unable
to finish the work, and hence it has
been largely left abandoned from
the contemporary repertoires of
the world’s great opera houses. Yet,
as brilliantly illustrated in this
interpretation of the piece, Purcell’s
music still carries all of the weight
and majesty of his original vision,
proving to any listeners that he was a
true master of Baroque opera.
But why do I act as if Sellars’ version
of the work, originally performed in
2013, is almost an entirely new work,
or at least one that would be largely
unrecognisable to the great Purcell
himself? Well, in typical Sellars
fashion he has turned his nose up at
orthodoxy, creating a work as unique
as his colourful dress sense or spiked
up hair. From the colourful stage
design by Angeleno graffiti artist
Gronk, to the accompanying text by
Nicaraguan writer Rosario Aguilar,
overflowing with emotion, this is a
collaboration of the arts in the truest
sense, full of intrigue and excitement,
once again showing why Sellars is one
of the most highly acclaimed opera
directors of our time.
This production forms part of
Sellars’ six month residency at
the ENO, one that he described
as “very exciting” due to their
“consistent artistic excellence” and
“lack of orthodoxy”. As well as this
production, he took on Adams’ The
Gospel According To The Other Mary,
which ran during last November
and December, to great success. I was
excited to see what The Indian Queen
held for me. I couldn’t honestly
say that I knew the work well at all
beforehand, but I knew that whenever
Sellars gets his hands on something it
is going to be interesting.
Whilst Dryden’s original text tells
the story of Latin America before
the Spanish Conquest, Sellars has
completely rewritten it, describing
it as “unrevivable” due to its highly
stylised take on the theme, as if
it were some kind of French love
story. Instead, he has transported
the story forward a generation, to
the horror and barbarism of the
conquistadors, raping and pillaging as
they went. And not only that, but he
has reformulated it using text from
The Lost Chronicles of Terra Firma, a

novel by Rosario Aguilar telling the
story of Mayan colonisation from a
female standpoint. It is the tale of an
Indian Queen, performed incredibly
sensitively by Julia Bullock, married
off to a sadistic Spanish general,
whom she then falls helplessly in love
with as he continues to destroy the
culture and heritage of her people
around her. It is an agonising insight
into a story lost in the annals of
history.
The opera opens with a series
of Mayan creation scenes,
contextualising the rich spiritual
heritage that existed when Spanish
forces, emotionless with their camo
gear and assault rifles, arrived.
In turn, panels painted by Gronk
descend from above like a deity, a
monolith akin to Kubrick’s creation
myths in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ballet
dancers act out these tales, elegantly
choreographed by Christopher
Williams, occupying the stage with
all the majesty of the gods they
represent.
And how does 17th
Century
baroque music from Western Europe
possibly accompany a story like
this, dark and full of pain? Well, to
my utter disbelief, perfectly! I think
Sellars describes it perfectly when
he says Purcell’s score is “the most
emotionally overwhelming music I
have ever put on stage”. Incorporating
both the original music as well some
of Purcell’s other religious works, a
soundscape is created that is at one
moment ethereal and in the next,
heartbreaking – truly breathtaking.
I cannot leave this review without
going into more depth about graffiti
artist Gronk’s unbelievable stage
design. Each panel that descends
from above, as if from heaven, is an
artwork in itself, not merely some
prop to aid understanding of the
story; it is the story, as integral to
it as any other part. He manages to
embody the rich artistic heritage of
Latin America, from the dazzling
colours to the naturalistic designs to
the anthropomorphic animal-god
figures boldly defined on canvas,
simultaneously bursting with energy
and static, like a relief on the side
of a Mayan pyramid at Chichen
Itza. They impose themselves upon
the stage with all the epicness of
pre-Columbian temples, as if the
whole opera is being performed in a
vast religious space, with dramatic
shadows projected onto them from
the clever front-lighting. It is a
wonder to behold, well worth the
visit, let alone the accompanying
genius of Purcell’s music. I really
do hope for further collaborations
between graffiti artists and opera
houses, whether Gronk or someone
else. No other group of artists have
such a command and understanding
of decorating space, whether it be our
daily architectural surroundings or a
West End stage – they are masters of
the mural.
In the past, Sellars has been
criticised a number of times for
straying too far from the creators
original vision, reinventing the opera
as his own as opposed to simply
enhancing themes that already
exist in the work. However, I don’t
mind too much and I don’t think
Purcell would either. In this work,
Sellars has created something truly
unique, not only a gesamtkunstwerk
that incorporates music, singing,
art, spoken word and ballet, but also,
unusually, an opera from a female
perspective, thanks to Aguilar’s
beautiful text. I had not realised
how alien this idea was, an opera
about women, until I actually saw
this work; I suddenly realised that
every single opera that I had ever
seen was from the male perspective
of an event, with female characters
merely adding colour to the script. It
was shocking, and highlighted to me
the underlying sexism that pervades
much of Western art – thank
goodness for Sellars! He has created
a work that is refreshing in every
sense and is yet another example of
his innovation in the field. And we
mustn’t also forget to acknowledge
the ENO in all of this: their tireless
support of operas that break away
from the conventional, even as they
struggle for their existence due to
the Draconian limitations imposed
on them by Arts Council England,
deserves to be celebrated. Lets hope it
survives long enough to put on many
more of Sellars works.
The Indian Queen is running at the
English National Opera until 14th
March.
