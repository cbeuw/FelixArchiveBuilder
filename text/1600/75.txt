Deputy President (Welfare) Jennifer Watson
Over the past four years, I have
come to realise just how critical
student welfare is. With the amount
of pressure we’re all under on a daily
basis, it’s essential to have the support
of the union behind us.
As you might know, I started
running a regular Welfare section in
Felix this year because I believed we
needed to reach more students and
help raise awareness while letting
people know what welfare resources
are available. I’m also familiar with
how the union operates due to my
current roles as both an academic
representative and a club secretary,
which have given me the necessary
expertise for the position.
Most importantly, through my
own experiences, I have come to
know exactly where the system fails
to provide students with the support
that they need.
So what do I plan to do about it? I
want to work on two key areas:
Mental Health -
- Set aside my lunchtimes to talk to
students regarding the mental health
resources available, and help them
find the best options
- Deal with the abysmal NHS
waiting times by running more
therapy-based group sessions
- Work with and/or lobby college
to expand the counselling services
offered
Accessibility –
- Hold welfare events at other
campuses so that medics and other
students not based primarily at South
Kensington can benefit from them
- Have better personal tutor
training to help support students
with welfare issues
- Provide more training for the
Welfare and the liberation officers
- Create resources to address more
minority specific issues
Deputy President (Welfare) Diba Esbati
My name is Chun-Yin and I am
the current ICSMSU Academic
Officer (Science Years). Over the
past year, I have had the privilege
to represent 400+ students across
16 cohorts. Together with my Reps
and working with the Faculty, I
have been able to realize improved
learning experiences for my students,
including roll-out of Panopto
recordings, strengthened academic
welfare support, improved teaching,
and the introduction of new career-
building opportunities for the
Biomedical Science program.
As your Deputy President
(Education), I aim to deliver on
several areas to improve your
learning, strengthen your academic
support, and increase your
education’s value, including:
- Best practice: To conduct a ‘census’
before and at my term’s start, so to
base my agenda on the issues that
you care about, and to work with
College on identifying/sharing ‘gold
standard’ practices
- Personal tutor support: To
introduce – as minimum– pastoral
groups of ~6 students and 2 staff
members, ensuring regular tutor
meetings and promoting face-to-face
time between students and staff
- Feedback: To introduce – as
minimum– a ‘3 good/3 bad things’
framework in assessment feedback
- ‘Hop-on’ representation: To make
it clear that you can contact anyone
in the Rep hierarchy if you have
Deputy President (Education) Chun-Yin San
learning concerns - you shouldn’t
have to be strategic in order to be
heard
I have many more ideas, so do get
in touch via email (cys12@imperial.
ac.uk). On Friday 9th
12:00-14:30 I’ll
have a drop-in at SAFB, and on the
3rd/9th/12th
13:15-14:00, I’ll be at Co-
Curricular Studies (3/F Sherfield) so
do come and have a chat!
I’m currently Felix’s Music Editor,
and I’ve always enjoyed reading,
writing and getting involved with
our student paper. I’ve written press
releases for the House of Commons,
so have a good understanding of how
journalism operates outside of the
university environment.
Felix has massively improved this
year, but there is always scope to go
that extra mile! I would love to take
Felix Editor
the reins next year and, if elected, I
plan to:
Improve our online presence by
creating a new website from scratch,
revamping the app and extending
our social media reach to ensure we
attract as many readers as possible.
I’ll increase our online advertising
scope and reinvest the profits into the
paper to increase its quality.
Recruit an online editorial team
to make news articles instantly
accessible.
Make Felix more open to all
by running workshops on news
reporting, editing and design. I’d
also increase the diversity of our
contributors; more photographers
and illustrators on board would add
depth to our reporting.
Get Felix out by 10am every Friday,
so you don’t have to wait until
Grace Rahman
lunchtime to get your fix.
Revive our gaming magazine
‘Another Castle’ to accompany
‘Phoenix’ and ‘I, Science’.
Get Felix back into halls for first
years so a copy is in their rooms on
the day they move in.
Continue to hold the College to
account, keeping Felix free from the
Union’s influence.
