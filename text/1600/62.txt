Tom Stoppard: Not so Hard After All
Tom Stoppard’s latest play has
been a long time coming. His
last work to grace the stage
was 2006’s Rock and Roll at The
Royal Court – and his last work at
the National Theatre was four years
before that, with The Coast of Utopia
in 2002. Nine years since his last play.
To call expectations high might just
be an understatement.
Early signs are promising. The play
is shaping up to be quintessentially
Stoppard, blending meaningful
discussions of complex scientific
ideas with eloquence and wit. Where
Arcadia tackled the second law of
thermodynamics, and Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are Dead dealt with
existentialism and free will, The
Hard Problem turns to the notion of
consciousness.
The titular Hard Problem (capitals
wholly necessary – as one character
explains, “we do brain science.
There is only one Hard Problem.”)
is one of explaining consciousness,
explaining our first person, subjective
experiences, phenomena such as
colour or taste. In the programme
notes, Stoppard credits the Australian
philosopher David Chalmers for
the phrase – as would most of the
internet – although he acknowledged
in a later interview that he “might
as well have credited Leibnitz” for
coining the term.
There’s an added incentive to be
hopeful in the form of the location
for Stoppard’s return to the stage: the
Dorfman Theatre at the National. A
redevelopment of the old Cottesloe
Theatre, it’s a wonderfully versatile
space, offering multiple possibilities
for staging.
Add in the fact it’s directed by
Nicholas Hytner, in his last show
at the National before departing as
its Director, and the anticipation is
almost unbearable.
At first glance, the set design
does little to reward or spurn that
anticipation. A collection of vertical
bars, entangled in a mess of wires,
loom over an empty stage. The first
scene rapidly reveals how this is going
to play out from a visual perspective,
as a minimalist approach to set
design evokes the settings rather than
outright stating them.
A bed and a desk comprise a
bedroom, some chairs and a coffee
table indicate a waiting room, and
so on. Bar the occasional use of a
backdrop, it’s left to a few items of
furniture and the work of the actors
Parth Thakerar as Amal, the arrogant
driven rival to Hilary for a job at the
Krole Institute for Brain Science.
The character’s interactions provide
the show with momentum that isn’t
necessarily provided by the plot itself.
It’s a surprisingly straightforward
affair – still well put-together,
certainly, but nowhere near as
meticulously composed as the likes of
Arcadia.
Stoppard admitted in interviews
that he adopted a tactic akin to
“write and see where it goes” for (at
least parts of) The Hard Problem, in
contrast to the extensive mapping-
out of previous plays. It makes
for an interesting experience,
as the play runs for a hundred
uninterrupted minutes, providing a
more streamlined and brisk Stoppard
experience. The content and general
style may not have changed, but
the overall form has, and it’s no bad
thing.
Does The Hard Problem match up to
the expectations piled upon it by its
very nature? Easily. There were a few
design choices that felt slightly off –
the scene change music in particular
had a nasty habit of either starting
late or running on for too long – but
nothing that actually harmed the
show.
Stoppard’s latest play is another
gem, quite possibly his best since
Arcadia (it always comes back to that,
doesn’t it?), and the director and cast
that have been enlisted to bring it to
life do an impeccable job. As Stoppard
himself put it, “I think the play’s been
done really, really well.”
The Hard Problem is on at the
National Theatre’s Dorfman Theatre
until 27th
May. Tickets from £15.

to suggest the setting – and it’s to the
credit of all involved that it works
wonderfully. The design allows
for the play to focus on Stoppard’s
typically glorious dialogue, forcing
the attention onto his words and the
actors delivering them, rather than
their surroundings.
The bars and wires hanging over
the stage turn out to be a touch
more exciting than just a mysterious
sculpture, coming to life in the scene
changes. As classical music plays over
the darkness, the bars and wires pulse,
flickering with the music. It’s clearly
intended to evoke images of brain
activity, but mostly it just comes
across as a pretty light show.
The rest of the play’s dealings
with brain activity are somewhat
more effective. The opening gambit
is classic misdirection, as tutor
Spike (Damien Molony) tells Hilary
(Olivia Vinall) “you’re looking at two
years. The jewellery was under the
floorboards. The police have nothing
to connect you to the scene of the
robbery.”
As the discussion unfolds, it’s
revealed they’re talking about the
‘Prisoners’ Dilemma’, a psychology
scenario that Hilary attempts to
deconstruct. It’s immediately,
classically Stoppard, discussing
high concepts in an engaging – and
supremely enjoyable – manner.
The cast are having a ball playing
with Stoppard’s dialogue to boot,
and it’s that which really helps the
show succeed. Vinall thrives as
Hilary, graduating from leading
roles in Shakespeare (Cordelia and
Desdemona in King Lear and Othello,
respectively) to what could arguably
be called the modern-day equivalent.
