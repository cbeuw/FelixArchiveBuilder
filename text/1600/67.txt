THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 67
FELIX 06.03.2015
"Whether
your
passion
lies with
telescopes,
planes or
medicine,
there is
much to
take your
breath
away."
House, which is home to the archive
collections of the British Museum,
V&A and Science Museum. The
tour description promised items that
had never been on public display,
which, coupled with 15 person cap on
participants, helped to instil a sense
of excitement from the outset.
The almost palatial grandeur of
the Grade II-listed Blythe House
tucked behind the Kensington
Olympia exhibition hall, seemed
a world removed from the bustle
of the Hammersmith Road that
led me to it. Its illustrious history,
the source of numerous anecdotes
from our vivacious hostess Rebecca,
was enough to satisfy most of our
appetites for an exclusive experience
even before we made it through the
foyer to start viewing the collection.
Blythe House holds 85% of the objects
owned by the Science Museum, with
only “anything larger than a washing
machine” being allocated to a more
spacious storage site in Wroughton.

galleries on Exhibition Road hold

only a tiny proportion of the
curiosities that the museum has to
offer. Our guides around the treasure
trove were two dedicated members of
the collections and curatorial team,
whose unlimited enthusiasm and
background knowledge ensured that
we were entertained throughout.
We worked our way through the
different levels of the building,
descending from the top floor storage
aptly dedicated to Space and Aviation
to the ground floor rooms housing
the, often bizarre, peculiarities
collected by Sir Henry Wellcome
of the Wellcome Trust. This
medically-themed part of the tour
included an entire room of wooden
prostheses, while another was filled
with statuettes of saints associated
with wellbeing and ancient sacrificial
objects intended to promote health
and fertility.
Many of the objects in the
collection hold a purely aesthetic
beauty and I don’t doubt that
anyone interested in the history
of modern design would relish a
visit to those rooms. Whether your
passion lies with telescopes, planes,
ships, or the history of medicine
or the development of modern
technology such as telephones and
audio speakers, there is much to take
your breath away. Our whistle-stop
(two-hour!) tour concluded with
a visit to the conservation studio
where museum staff were busy
cleaning old calculators in time for
their appearance at a new exhibition
dedicated to Mathematics. The
presence of a Biosafety Hood and the
strong smell of chemicals in the room
almost brought to mind a typical lab
space at Imperial!
It felt incredibly special to be
allowed to freely wander around
those rooms and inspect the objects;
I can’t help but echo the sentiments
of Sir Roy Strong, a former director
of the V&A, who argued that the site
“should be not just a dumping ground
but an exciting new complex for the
public” when the original bids for the
space were first being put together.
I guess that, until an increase in arts
funding makes that possible, we must
place our faith in the curators of the
Science Museum exhibitions as they
select which of those items should be
brought out of hiding to best tell the
inspiring stories of science.
Considering my own
overwhelmingly positive experiences
at the festival, I can’t help but think
how much of a shame it was that the
event did not attract more attention.
Did the programme not pack enough
of a punch? Or is it more likely that
organisers of an art history festival
(even if one of the themes deals with
the subversive avant-garde) will
always be faced with the burden of
shedding the stuffiness and highbrow
scholasticism that is associated with
the term? Perhaps to remain relevant
and interesting to a new generation of
art lovers, art history needs to engage
with the wider debate of the art world
and find its own version of ‘now’. I
just hope that View Festival survives
another year in order to lead the way.
The View Festival was on at the
Institut Français, 27th
Feb - 1st
March.
"Perhaps
to remain
relevant,
art history
needs
to find
its own
version of
“now”.
