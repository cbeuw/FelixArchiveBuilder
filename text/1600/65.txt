Arianna Sorba finds bad acting deflates Harajuku Girl’s fine script
Tokyo No-Go: When acting goes wrong
I’m pretty obsessed with Japanese
culture. I’m also an ardent
feminist, and I’m constantly
moaning to anyone who’ll listen
about the lack of interesting female
characters in modern literature.
So I was more than ready to love
Harajuku Girls, a new play about three
women growing up in modern day
Tokyo, treading the line between
empowerment and victimhood
as they take up work in Tokyo’s
notorious red light district. Heck,
they even gave me a free pint with
my press ticket. When I settled in to
my excellent seat at the Finborough
Theatre, a tiny venue above a pub, I
was already glowing with admiration
for the whole thing.
Alas, it was short-lived. It turns
out that no amount of intelligent
direction, clever staging, and
excellent scriptwriting can
compensate for plain old bad acting.
And I mean painfully bad acting.
The opening scene was probably the
worst. After an incredibly awkward
pause where one actress clearly just
forgot her lines, the rest of the cast
seemed to take the entire scene to
recover, so I was too busy cringing
to really gather what was going on.
I later had a quick flick through the
script (another press ticket perk) and
sure enough, one of the actors had
accidentally jumped ahead a good
page and a half of dialogue.
Once the cast regained their
confidence the quality picked up,
but never so much as to be really
convincing. Like I said, I’m a
committed feminist, so I don’t say the
following lightly, but of the five main
cast members, the three women were
definitely less believable than the two
men. Perhaps this was simply because
the women had more complex,
demanding roles than the two men
did - and for that I give immense
credit to the scriptwriter, Francis
Turnly, for writing such interesting
characters - but often the female
actors seemed somewhat panicked by
the immensity of the opportunity,
and ended up overcompensating,
rushing through dialogue, or stepping
on each other’s lines.
This was particularly true of
the main character, Mari, played
by Haruka Abe, who incidentally
features as the main role in Clean
Bandit’s ‘Rather Be’ music video.
For the simplest of lines, like
“you’re going to be late for work”,
her emphasis was all wrong in a
school-play sort of way, and it only
got worse as the script became more
demanding. The moment when Mari
tells her father “I love you but I don’t
even know you” was over-egged to the
extent that it simply just highlighted
the cliché of the sentiment, rather
than the subtlety. Meanwhile the
character Yumi, played by Kunjue Li,
was meant to be both innocent and
simultaneously painfully self-aware
of her own low prospects, telling her
friends “it’s not my fault I’m stupid”
and aspiring to work as a lift operator.
But she was played with such naiveté
that her complexity of character was
lost almost completely. (It didn’t help
that at one point the director literally
dressed her in a spotty onesie.)
In fact, there were moments
throughout the play where I felt that
the excellent script was somewhat
let down by the nervous actors,
since Francis Tunly has managed to
create truly exciting, interesting, and
believable characters with this work.
As the three childhood friends grow
up, their developing relationships
are portrayed with such an authentic
combination of support and jealousy
that I was genuinely surprised to find
out that the scriptwriter was a man.
The gradual transition Mari makes
from schoolgirl to sex worker, as
she slowly compromises more and
more of herself in order to achieve
her dreams, was written perfectly
convincingly; the only slight irony is
that Mari’s dream is to go to acting
school.
Even the seedy male characters of
the play are well rounded; through
the use of increasingly sparing
dialogue, Tunly convinces you to
almost forgive them their creepiness,
revealing their humanity. This
was especially effective due to the
immense talent of Nomo Gakuji,
who managed to play both Mari’s
father and her client at different
points in the performance with such
confidence and skill that it didn’t
quite make me queasy watching it.
The staging of the play was also
nothing short of spectacular,
especially given how little space the
theatre provides, a testament to what
can be achieved when the cast are
willing to do some heavy lifting. In a
bold and incredibly effective decision
by the director, Jude Christian, the
main cast members often switched
costume on stage during a scene
change, still in character. The
moments where Mari was helped
into her clothes by her best friend,
before checking her make-up in the
‘mirror’ that was the audience, were
some of the most poignant of the
whole performance, despite the fact
that the walls were moving around
her and it didn’t quite make sense
with the storyline. There’s inevitably
something incredibly character
revealing about the way a woman
takes her dress off. And the designers
managed to perfectly recreate an
authentic Tokyo atmosphere with
their choice of music and props,
without ever over-doing the kawaii
Hello Kitty cliché.
But all this cannot save a play
when the main characters just aren’t
played well enough to convince. It’s
not as though I didn’t enjoy myself;
in fact there was one particularly
dark scene where I was briefly
genuinely terrified – although come
to think of it, the moment broke as
soon as someone spoke. It was just
so frustrating to watch a wonderful
script with such exciting potential
being wasted by uncomfortable actors
talking over each other and overusing
their eyebrows. Perhaps a few nights
later in the run, the cast will get over
their nerves and finally deliver. If
they do, then perhaps this team will
finally have a true gem of a play on
their hands.
