Fred Fyles on populism, cultural criticism, and Kim Kardashian
Ban Bland: In Defence of Popularity
Popularity. If the innumerable
American coming-of-age films
have taught us anything, it’s
that popularity is a double-edged
sword; to be popular is to be both
loved and loathed in equal measure.
Nowhere is this more true than
in the world of music and film,
where popularity often leads to an
immediate critical reaction that
is completely divorced from the
content itself. The phrase “I liked it
before it was popular” has become
so ubiquitous as to enter into
cliche, forming – alongside listicle,
hipster, and cereal cafe – part of our
post-postmodern cultural lexicon.
With the internet ushering in an
unprecedented era of hype, whereby
acts can boom and bust in the time
it takes to get through an episode of
Girls, as well as a collective hive-
mind insatiable in its appetite for
think-pieces, our relationship with
popularity is only going to become
more and more complex.
I am writing in defence of
popularity. In defence of the idea
that something being popular and
something being high quality are
not mutually exclusive. Just because
something is liked by many people
all over the world, it doesn’t make it
bad – to me this seems like a simple
fact, but I have lost count of the
number of times that people willingly
reject certain aspects of our culture
based on how present they are in
our landscape. Furthermore, their
attacks never form part of a critical
discourse, but instead act generally
as proud declarations of ignorance:
‘Beyonce’s new album? Of course I
haven’t listened to it. Kanye West’s
latest antics? Why should I care?’. The
phrase ‘the wise man knows that he
knows nothing’ may sound good, but
I fear certain individuals have taken
it to heart, feeling that their refusal
to engage in popular culture is an
admirable personal trait.
Now, I am not saying that spending
all day on TMZ is a better use of
someone’s time than reading Virginia
Woolf, but both activities are in some
way educational; your judgement just
depends on how you value culture.
In an ideal world I would know all
about Sartre’s philosophy, the work
of Marie Curie, and what happened
between Solange and Jay-Z in that
elevator, but this is impossible; we
simply don’t have enough time,
and knowing everything is an
impossibility. However, it is one
thing to recognise this fact, and
quite another to actively enjoy not
knowing something, willingly refuse
to be clued-in. They are people who
believe that it’s impossible to love
both Martin Heidegger and Made In
Chelsea, Taylor Swift and Thelonious
Monk; in our post-internet age, where
a wealth of culture is available at our
fingertips, such an attitude is simply
outdated.
That said, I understand such an
attitude, and sympathise; it is easy
to convince yourself that refusing
to engage with the popular is not a
character defect, but instead makes
you a special snowflake. If you’re
the kind of person who would rather
read real books than magazines, who
would prefer to be in bed watching
a movie than out at the club, who
shares be-bop interpretations of
Meghan Trainor on Facebook with
the caption “this is REAL MUSIC,
take me back to the ‘50s!”, then, well,
unfortunately you’re part of the
problem. Looking at the past with
rose-tinted spectacles, it is easy to feel
that back then what was popular was
also authentic: Kubrick’s films, the
Great American Novel, The Beatles
– these were what everyone enjoyed
back then, right? Well, The Shining
was accused of destroying all that
was suspenseful in the original novel,
James Agee only received acclaim
for A Death in the Family following
his death in 1955, and the highest
selling single 1967, the same year
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club was
released? ‘Release Me’ by Engelbert
Humperdinck. It seems that things
are no worse today than they ever
were.
I feel that, having come this far, I
should include an addendum: I am a
massive snob. I am a cultural critic,
so this is to be expected, and I am
completely proud of my aversion to
certain elements of modern life, a
number of which correspond with
what is popular. However, there
is a key difference: I don’t hate
things because they’re popular; I
hate them because they’re populist.
The difference may be subtle, but
it’s there. While a piece of music,
theatre, or prose achieves the title of
popular simply by being enjoyed by
a large number of people, something
is populist if it has been specifically
engineered to appeal to the widest
possible number of consumers. To
be populist is to devalue what art
means, reducing it cynically to a
mere product – a sweet pap made
to appease a broad swath of the
population.
Yes, it is true that there is a
crossover between what is populist
and what is popular; just look as
Sam Smith, who recently won four
Grammy Awards for his soul-
without-Soul – blandishments for
the bland. However, there is a key
difference, which we must recognise
and appreciate. Kim Kardashian, for
example, who is perhaps the closest
we have to a deity of the digital
age, is popular, but certainly not
populist – her image may be carefully
curated to generate online clicks,
but it is certainly not designed to be
appeasing. Her recent cover of Paper
Magazine, which ‘broke the internet’
thanks to Jean-Paul Goude’s decision
to cover her derriere in baby oil,
was not intended to be inoffensive,
but instead to generate controversy,
something it surely achieved. In
contrast, Kate Middleton couldn’t
be further from Kim K; Middleton’s
personal style, which generally
consists of various outfits from
Whistles and Riess, was part of what
led acclaimed author Hilary Mantel
to describe her as “designed by a
committee and built by craftsmen,
with a perfect plastic smile”. In
this way, Middleton perfectly
encapsulates the word populist:
inoffensive, safe, and boring. It is this
that we must fight against – if I am
going to be a snob, then by God, I’m
going to be the right kind. The only
other option is boredom.
