treatment, and don’t forget that when
we did IVF for the first time, we were
actually standing on the edge of a
precipice: we had no idea for certain
that we were going to have a normal
baby, although all the experiments
that had been done would suggest
that.
“Our lab at Imperial did the first
pre-implantation diagnosis, actually
biopsying a cell, taking cells away for
genetic analysis. That had never been
done before, so, even though we had
tested it in various animals, again, it’s
a leap in the dark, but you know you
had done the best you could.”
The decision has generated a huge
amount of media coverage, much
of which has been focused on the
ethical criticisms levelled by many
opponents and religious groups.
“I think the media coverage has
been pretty gentle really,” said
Winston. “The ‘three-parent family’
level was inevitable, and it’s a silly
label, but it’s a convenient piece of
shorthand. But actually, very few
journalists produced shock horror,
and I think journalists talked it up
because they thought it was going to
be very big.
“To tell you the truth, I think the
media coverage for a huge number
of scientific things has improved
massively in Britain over the last 5-7
years. You see it even in the biggest
comic of all, the Daily Mail, which
is classically the one newspaper
you would not regard as scientific
journal: don’t forget that when the
Japanese nuclear accident happened,
Mike Hanlan, the chief scientific
"I think
the media
coverage
has been
pretty
gentle"
correspondent of the Mail was very
measured in what he said about
Fukushima. He said this was not a
cause for abandoning nuclear fission,
this was an aberrant response to an
aberrant piece of building, and even
beforehand we could have realised
we were doing something that was
probably not wise.
“I think actually, Mike Hanlan’s
response in a tabloid newspaper was
highly refreshing, and is somewhere
I think even 10 years ago, we would
have had a much more aggressive,
much less measured view. I think
British scientific journalism has
improved immeasurably and I think,
actually, to some extent, that’s had
a knock on effect right through to
the sort of journalism that you do in
Felix.”
"I don’t see
anything
wrong with
playing
God."
The media coverage of the decision
has highlighted the important
relationshiop between science and
politics, and raised questions about
where genetic treatments could lead.
In the future, germ-line gene
therapy could treat diseases such as
cystic fibrosis, by replacing faulty
segments of nuclear DNA in the
genome of a fertilised egg. The
research is at a very early stage at the
moment, and concerns over safety
and ethics are much more profound
than for mitochondrial transplants.
“I wouldn’t be happy with germ-
line gene therapy, because I think
the problem with that is that you
are very likely to have an effect on
other loci in the genome, which may
start to perform differently from
what you expected, because, as we
know, upstream and downstream
of any mutation, there will be other
signalling areas of the genome,
micro RNAs for example, which may
actually end up producing something
which is completely unexpected. The
likelihood with mitochondria is that,
because their role is so specialised
(they’re really just concerned with
energy metabolism) that it’s a
reasonable gamble, if you like.
“I don’t see anything wrong with
playing God. To my mind, if you are
religious, playing God is what you
should do, because actually what I
believe is that if you are playing God
you are actually imitating God, using
your God-given intelligence to try
and better the world.
“The issue then is not playing God,
but trying to supplant God, which
becomes much more an issue of how
you use wisdom and judgement to
make a good choice rather than a bad
choice, and I think that’s what we all
do as scientists all the time, which
is a universal concern for all of us at
Imperial College.
“If you’re doing physics, for
instance, there’s all sorts of
implications, medical physics is a
good example, nuclear physics would
be another one. There are times when
physicists have stood back and said,
well actually this may be going in
the wrong direction, because we’re
doing something which we feel very
uncomfortable with.
“So I think making a wise choice
is right. Now of course with
hindsight you could say that perhaps
Oppenheimer, say, made the wrong
choice in making the atomic bomb,
but of course that was at a time
of conflict when there were very
different issues going on.
“In peacetime, during the normal
workings of a democratic society,
that wisdom of how to make the best
choice is part of what we have to do
as scientists: that’s why I think we
need to be very much more aware
of a breadth of knowledge, not just
knowledge of a narrow area of our
own discipline, and to my mind,
one of the things we have to do as
scientists is to keep aware of the broad
implications of the work we do.”
