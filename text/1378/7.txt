looming? Let us help you stay alive
O
ne of the main things
that can affect how
well we concentrate is
our diet and the kinds
of foods we eat. It is
very easy to snack on sugary foods
and drinks to make us feel better
during times of revision, but this
can actually have a negative effect
on our ability to take in information.
So we’ve put together a list of ten
foods and drinks that will help your
mind, as well as body.
Eat for success: our guide to work-friendly food
1. Porridge
Start your day the right way with a
bowl of porridge. Oats have a high
content of complex carbohydrates
and fibre which encourage slow
digestion and stable blood-glucose
levels, so you will have a steady
stream of energy throughout the
morning.
Oats are also high in beta-glucan,
which has been linked to the pre-
vention of heart disease.

foods, meaning you can stay con-
centrating for longer. Xylitol is
available from supermarkets and
health food stores under the brand
name Perfect Sweet.
5. Wholegrains
A small change, like changing from
white to brown bread, can have a
surprising effect on our concen-
tration levels. The carbohydrates
in refined and processed foods are
quickly released into the body and
so make us feel great, but only in the
short term, after which our mood
drops. The complex carbohydrates
found in natural and unprocessed
foods work like time release cap-
sules and so keep the brain fueled
for longer. However you should still
limit yourself to 3 fist sized servings
of complex cabs a day as too much
carbohydrates (even from whole-
grains) can upset sugar balance
and effect mood and energy levels.
6. Drink plenty of water
It is important to keep hydrated as
the whole body, but especially the
brain, needs plenty of water
to function correctly. Long
hours of study can mean
we turn to coffee and
tea to keep us awake,
but these should be
kept to a minimum
as they upset blood
sugar levels, dehy-
drate the body and
re-
duce absorption of nutrients from
foods. A can of coke contains
about 8 teaspoons of sugar,
which is 4 times more than
should be in the blood at any
one time. This will result in
massive sugar slump and
loss of concentration when
insulin takes the sugar out
of the blood.
7. Dried fruit and nuts
These are great to snack
on in place of chocolates
and sweets. Packed full of
vitamins, minerals and energy
respectively they will help keep
you working. However don’t over
indulge as too much dried fruit will
lead to the sugar hit that you would
get from chocolate; a small handful
now and then is recommended, not
a whole bag!
8. Fresh fruit
Fresh fruit is packed with vitamins
and anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants
help combat oxygen
freeradicals–chem-
icals produced
by the body that
can cause dam-
age to nerves
and the brain!
Avocados are
a particularly
great fruit to
eat as they are
thought to in-
crease
blood flow to the brain and thus
help it function better.
9. Protein rich foods e.g. fish
Certain foods are also rich in amino
acids which are important to neu-
rotransmitters - chemicals crucial
to the passage of nerve impulses in
the brain. Many protein-rich foods
such as fish contain the amino acid
tryptophan, which plays a key role
in the manufacture of serotonin,
which affects mood and alertness.
Dopamine levels are also increased
- the brain chemical responsible for
the feeling of alertness. The brain
also requires substantial amounts
of fatty acids, such as Omega-3,
found in oily fish, which are used to
maintain the health of brain cells.
They enhance the receptors of se-
rotonin which makes the brain bet-
ter able to receive the message to
feel good, relax and be calm.
10. Seeds
Seeds such as pumpkin, sunflower,
sesame and linseeds are all good
sources of protein, essential fatty
acids and zinc. Zinc is thought to
be particularly important to brain
health and plays a significant role
in activating certain areas of the
brain.
2. Free range eggs
These are an excellent source of
protein which we need for energy,
growth and to produce essential en-
zymes. Poached or boiled eggs are
a healthier choice than fried eggs,
because you don’t need to add fat
during cooking.
Always try and go for organic free
range eggs as they are higher in
essential fatty acids (EFAs), which
have been linked to good brain
health. Columbus Omega 3 eggs
are one of the best buys as they are
from birds specifically fed on a high
Omega 3 diet.
3. Natural yoghurt
This contains active and living bac-
terial cultures which help to boost
the immune system. It is especially
important to look after your im-
mune system during revision and
exams as stress can make you more
vulnerable to illnesses. By helping
to maintain the balance of bacteria
in your bowel and prevent
the overgrowth of can-
dida yeast you will also
be helping your mind, as
too much of this yeast has
been linked to emotional
symptoms and poor men-
tal state.
4. Use xylitol in place of
sugar
Xylitol is a 100% natural
substance found in fruits
and plants, which has far
fewer calories and car-
bohydrates than sugar,
and releases its energy
much slower (it has
a GI value of just 7,
about ten times lower
than sugar). A slow
release of energy
means you will have
more constant blood
sugar levels, which stops
the peaks and troughs of
mood and energy that
you get with high sugar
A lighter side: toilet grafitti at its worst
Toilet grafitti in the library around exam time tends to reveal some startling
truths about students under stress. Alongside nerdy jokes (normally
painstakingly drawn), we have pithy little truths like the one above.
I’m sure this is all very clever, but we honestly don’t
understand this one. I guess we do the wrong subjects.
We couldn’t possibly comment. Ah, redundancy. Good one.
These are taken from the toilets in the library. Add your grafitti there.
