Re-Play : Command and Conquer
“You can get more with a kind word and a tank rush than you can with just a kind word.” Mike Cook
E
veryone loved Command
and Conquer. Much in the
same way that everyone
loves Bruce Forsyth, or the
Andrex puppy. You might
pretend to hate the bland sci-fi, or
the shallow tactics, or the aged,
backwards ideas about resource
collection. You might just never play
games. But deep down, in a long-
forgotten neural region, encoded in
some primitive genetic sequence,
there’s an instinct that’s dedicated
to the tank rush.
Why? Why is it so popular? And
why, with the release of Tiberium
Wars this April, is it still so popu-
lar? Because as a counterpoint to
the above raving, even the biggest
fan of the real-time strategy series
generally accepts that the story is
“so bad, it’s good”. They understand
that it has all the tactical nuances of
dropping a Grand Piano on Wile E.
Coyote. They accept that the game’s
insistence on the harvest-build-at-
tack cycle is older than the hills.
But Jesus. The tank rushes.
And you know, it wasn’t always
tanks either. Memorably, I once
stormed a NOD stronghold with
over a hundred freedom-fighting,
terrorist-shooting, press-upping
machine gunners once. The Prod-
igy got it wrong – you need to be
never outgunned, and never out-
numbered. The feeling of safety in
numbers, as well as the hive-mind
power of pointy-pointy-click-click
isometric control, is comforting.
And powerful. You float high above
the war, beyond it, clicking and
watching shapes move, swiftly and
righteously. You indicate the target
of a nuclear weapon with a thought-
less press of a mouse. Apocalypse
ensues.
Why does it still figure now? For
sheer tactical depth, it’s hard to beat
the Total War series, and games like
Supreme Commander and Com-
pany Of Heroes both do macro- and
micro-destruction almost to perfec-
tion. So why should Command and
Conquer still be a worthy series,
even at this old age?
In some ways, it’s a respect thing.
In the same way we pretend to be
good at football, because we believe
we invented it, maybe Command
and Conquer’s success is in part
due to feeling sorry that the inven-
tor of so many gaming standards
has got long in the tooth.
But it’s more likely because Com-
mand and Conquer refuses to be
moved by trends in gaming. In-
stead, it sticks to its guns and fulfils
the idea of revolution, rather than
evolution.
From the original game - which is
still just about playable today - the
emphasis was on a certain style
of play. But whereas some series
change direction dramatically, Com-
mand and Conquer understood its
strengths as well as its weaknesses,
and preferred to streamline its run-
ning rather than add in strange new
features. Even with its latest re-
lease, the hugely popular Tiberium
Wars, there is much that harks back
to the old days.
Its intentional, too. From the
hammy video cutscenes that intro-
duce each mission – with a proud
history of Michael Ironside, James
Earl Jones, Michael Ironside, and
some bint from Battlestar Galactica
– through to the use of some of the
same sound effects from ten years
ago, the game constantly pays re-
spects to its history.
This comes through in the way
you play. Because although the
scale and beauty of a Supreme
Commander endgame is undeni-
ably impressive, there’s a feeling of
pilgrimage every time you sit down
to begin Command and Conquer’s
original GDI campaign from the
beginning.
“Are you pickin’ this up? Good.”
The guy looks like something out
of Toy Story, and speaks in a similar
way, yet you’re transported instant-
ly back to the time you saw him first.
And when that map flickers up, and
you see the hovercraft, the glitter-
ing seas, the tiny, blocky little turret
that’s putting away at your men.
Well, it is instinctive.
Maybe it’s genuinely something
true of any kind of “retro” gaming,
but C&C feels stripped down, and
pure. There’s no rotatable camera,
or day and night cycle. You don’t
need to consider terrain types, or
the morale of your men. All you
need to do is get a truckload of cash,
and build as many of the biggest,
metal-coated, fire-spewing things
that you can.
And then you go to war.
But there’s nothing like Command
and Conquer’s war, because it gave
birth to the clichés that we now hate
– there’s a reason it feels repetitive
and samey now, and that’s because
other games have made it so. When
you first played the commando mis-
sions, quipping and walking your
way through a carefully-designed
maze, it was new. It was great fun.
Once it featured in every fiction-
al war between 1997 and now, it
stopped being fun.
Because it worked so well. Be-
cause you didn’t need to “get” any-
thing in order to play it. It was at
the level of simplicity that Pac-Man
had, that Pong had. It taught you
tactics as if it knew how big the gen-
re would become in ten years time.
It gave you a helping hand up so
you wouldn’t feel left behind when
Warcraft III came along.
It’s on a Micro Machines level of

Kane, played by Joseph Kucan who also directs a lot of the video shown in the series, is one of PC gaming’s best-known bad guys.
Thinking of playing the golden
RTS series again? Old C&C games
are rare to find preowned, but on
eBay you can pick up the origi-
nal or the sequel, Red Alert, for
around a fiver each.
However, what with it being
a decade old this year, EA have
re-released the entire series,
from the original through to the
contemporary Generals, and
that can be picked up as a lot for
about £19.99 - though the current
release is somewhat shaky, and
requires some patching.
simplicity, and that’s why everyone
loves it. That’s why you pluck a no-
madic group out of the Amazonian
rainforest, put them in front of a
150MHz PC, and within two hours
they’ll be overrunning your base
with engineers and flame tanks. It’s
because Command and Conquer
doesn’t care. It doesn’t want you
to play Rock-Paper-Scissors with
heavy cavalry and bald guys with
catapaults. It just wants you to build
things that explode and then make
them do just that.
There’s been a lot said about the
strategy genre lately, about how Me-
dieval 2 and Supreme Commander
are at the forefront of a new wave
of PC Gaming, that they’ve made
it a viable platform again and that
it shows there’s still innovation in
the market. But I think many gam-
ers buy and play these games out of
co-operation. Out of duty. Like it’s
what’s expected of them.
Most of them, though, know what
Hell’s March sounds like, they
can make the noise an Ion Can-
non makes before it immolates a
Hum-Vee, and they believe they
can do the Tanya laugh just as they
remember it. That’s not gamers
moving on. That’s not “innovation”.
That’s instinct.
