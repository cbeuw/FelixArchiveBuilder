O
n the evening of
Thursday 22nd March
most of the squad
met at Ved, Subby
and Jib’s house for a
pre-tour party until we began our
journey out to Thailand at 5am.
I spent the first part of the night
working in the IC Library, which
was still brimming with activity
when I packed up just after 3am.
Being Imperial this wasn’t very
surprising; however it was still
amusing enough to take a few
photos. After a couple of hours at
Jib’s we caught a couple of buses
to Victoria, hopped to Gatwick and
began the check-in process for
Qatar Airways. Though inevitably
stressful, being a London air-
port, it didn’t take long and we
all boarded our flight happily at
9am. Two long, 7 hour flights later,
with a short stopover in Doha, we
were approaching Bangkok over
misty striped rural landscapes and
villages. My sleep on the second
flight: 4.5 hours.
Finally we arrived in Bangkok,
early, to be greeted by hotel staff
and transport. Our first road jour-
ney from the airport to the city cen-
tre was quite an experience, but
something we would end up getting
very used to. There is no concept
of road safety in Thailand, and eve-
rything from seatbelts to any form
of vehicle regulation seemed to be
lacking. Our accommodation was
5 star and from my 31st floor room
there were beautiful views of cen-
tral Bangkok. After our early arrival
we were fed thanks to the kindness
of Ved’s Mother and Brother, who
live locally. We spent the remainder
of the day soaking up the sights and
smells of our area: our clothes did
most of the soaking, as our predom-
inantly UK bred bodies weren’t very
accustomed to 38˚C humid heat!
The open air pool was much en-
joyed; it was on the 11th floor, that’s
the same height as the EE building
- if only we had a pool up there too!
That evening I went in the wrong
direction on the SkyTrain, a fast and
clean method of transport built on
15 metre concrete plinths above the
main streets. Eventually finding
my way to Siam Paragon (Siam is
a common name in Thailand, as it
was the country’s former name), a
large western style shopping mall
and cinema, we enjoyed a game of
bowling and tasty (and extremely
cheap) Thai food before calling it a
day. My sleep that night: 6.5 hours.
On Sunday we had an early start
to play our first match. It was to be
our first day of cricket and was to be
a one-day friendly game against the
RoyalBangkokSportsClub(RBSC).
I got up at 6:30am to have a wander
and take a few photos before it start-
ed to get too hot. The streets were
brimming with life even that early
in the morning - it seems the city
doesn’t sleep, or maybe it doesn’t
work so hard during the day! The
beauty of the RBSC ground was
simply breathtaking; skyscrapers
lined the boundaries and a horse
racing track circled the field. This
would be a memorable day for all,
but particularly for fresher’s Ali
and Omair who made their Imperial
debuts. We enjoyed a good 35 over
game, though playing in 39˚C was
an experience some of us coped
with better than others! I was par-
ticularly impressed by Shiraz who
kept wicket for 3 hours and then
went straight in to open the batting.
However, Almaher and Ved were
the stars of the show with a 5 wicket
haul and 36 runs respectively.
After being stranded in a Sri
Lankan airport for 26 hours,
Abeetha finally joined us and we
chilled at the hotel; a few of us went
for a swim, and some of the less
tired members of the squad ate out
locally. Food and drink in Thailand
is very cheap, costing less than £2
for a very good meal. My sleep that
night: 5 hours.
Monday saw an early departure
from the Hotel to catch our 7:30am
flight to Phuket Island. We enjoyed
the low cost ‘Nok Airlines’ with its
beak nosed planes and falling-to-
pieces seats. Towards the end of
our 2 hour flight we began to de-
scend and the clouds cleared we
were treated to spectacular views
of the peninsula and surrounding
Islands. Jagged and steep moun-
tains were shrouded in low cloud
and mist and surrounded by dense
jungle. The plane landed success-
fully to cheers from the squad, and
cars drove the distance to our hotel
in the touristy Patong resort. That
afternoon we ate at a small Indian
place that played some classic Bol-
lywood tunes favoured by some of
the lads. Some of the squad then
enjoyed a local massage, all stick-
ing to (mostly) innocent activities,
before descending down to the
beach to Jetski. In the evening we
enjoyed the delights of Patong: piz-
za and some “speciality dancing”.
My sleep that night: 4.5 hours.
We had another early morning on
Tuesday as we departed the hotel to
catch a boat to the Phi Phi Islands.
This beautiful collection of Islands
about 30 miles off Phuket rise up out
of the water vertically, like some-
thing out of a film set. In fact, they
have hosted many film sets. Our
boat tour was very touristy, but that
didn’t stop us enjoying the sights,
including flying fish and monkeys.
After a stopover at Phi Phi, we vis-
ited two snorkelling locations. The
first one was close enough to one
of the desert island beaches, with
pesky monkeys prancing about in
the sand. I swam straight to it, and
after helping a monkey unscrew the
top of a half full bottle of fresh water,
watched it drink and dared to pet its
head. A few moments later the boys
arrived but all stood in a huddle a
few metres off shore, saying they
had been warned about the vicious
monkeys! In all fairness though, a
few minutes later the monkeys did
get into a fight which made Wrestle-
Mania look like a children’s puppet
show. We were allowed to explore
the main island, Phi Phi, after lunch
and played with a Nerf ball on one
of the most beautiful beaches we’d
ever seen. After returning to Patong
we enjoyed some fiercely contested
beach cricket in the setting sun. Un-
sportsmanlike behaviour from Im-
perial B led to the early dismissal of
captain, Thil; controversy arose and
soon false allegations of match fix-
ing were being hurled at club presi-
dents Anura and Jibran. A crowd of
spectators began to gather as local
residents wondered why a group of
Englishmen kept hitting a ball out
into the ocean and running like old
ladies at an M&S sale. We made no
effort to explain. After returning to
the hotel, some of the squad went
out for another massage and some
drinks - hardcore stuff to follow up
4 near-sleepless nights! My sleep
that night: 6.5 hours.
Wednesday was our day of depar-
ture from Phuket and Leon and I
got up at 6am to go for a morning
stroll. As soon as we found a local
path into the hills it became a bit
more than a morning stroll, and we
ended up exploring many miles into
the jungle. As we got deeper, the
noise was deafening, some insects
so loud they caused our ears to res-
onate! We saw many ant trails and
large flying insects, as well as some
locals who lived up the hill. That
afternoon some of the squad went
paragliding, and then we made the
trip back to the airport and then
back to Bangkok thanks again to
Nok-Air. Upon returning to the ho-
tel we turned in for an early night,
ready for the tournament the next
day. Thil treated us to a team talk
about what to expect of the 6-a-side
tournament and some of the squad
went out. My sleep that night: 6.5
hours.
On Thursday morning we had
our first round of matches, three of
which were before lunch. Our pitch
this time was at another of the RB-
SC’s picturesque grounds; this time
sporting a jogging track and three
luxury swimming pools. Imperial
A were quickly taken aback by the
quality of the opposition we were
facing. Despite the international
teams we were up against, we put
up a good fight and narrowly missed
out on a spot in the knockout stage
of the tournament. In honesty we
were outplayed by the better bat-
ting of the opposition. We could only
watch in admiration as the batsmen
of Bahrain, Maldives and Calcutta
launched ball after ball beyond the
boundary. After completing our
Cricket Club ventures to Thailand
I wonder how many times these boys did the Bangkok joke before it got old and too painful.
