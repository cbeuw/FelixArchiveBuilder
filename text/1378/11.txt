I, Gamer
I
’m not a big fan of water
in games. Not because
they’re badly done or an-
ything – although that’s
usually true, too. Simply
because they terrify me. It’s
the lack of control, the murky
darkness, and the cutscene
that every single game has to
have where you get shown the
evil fishlike hellspawn that’s
waiting in there to eat you.
This week, though, I’m
feeling slightly anti-water in
the real world. In fact, Felix
Games comes to you this week
in exile, an editorial forced out
of its natural surroundings by
a burst radiator pipe. Ceiling
leaking, cupboards soaked,
computer barely saved. We
lost a lot of good men back
there.
Thankfully, being a little
worn around the edges doesn’t
do much harm, and so we’ve
managed to get you something
to look at despite the more
damp surroundings. In fact,
this term we’re all about being
worn around the edges, as we
delve into charity shops, eBay
and our own misspent youth
to uncover the great games of
yesteryear that really deserve
a second go.
We’re hoping to have a
run down of a host of great
emulation and mod remakes,
a chance to win yourself some
of the best-loved classics, and
our personal experiences of
those huge gaming monoliths.
As well as our retro theme,
we’ll be covering Imperial’s
third Games and Media Event,
hosted by the Department of
Computing in May, and hope-
fully beginning a new regular
for this term, as we explore
the greatest MMOs out there
- with fresh eyes.
And, as always, we’re look-
ing for new submissions, new
ideas, and interesting gamers
out there at Imperial who have
something to share. Competi-
tive? Creative? Do you loathe
everything that adorns these
pages? We don’t care where
you want us to shove our Wii-
motes, just let us know.
For now, though, I’m trying
to locate my Oblivion disc so I
can have a mid-exams break
in Tamriel. Bear with us as the
writers, editors and whatnot
go through that tricky period
of flagellation and prayer
known as examinations, and
remember to take fifteen-
minute breaks for each hour
of revision. Or a fifteen-minute
break of revision from every
hour of gaming.
Hell, something like that.

This Week in Videogames
O
f all the demographic
groups you could’ve
pinned into a politi-
cal situation, gamers
seem to be the least
obvious candidates. When Rock or
Punk had their turn in the limelight
of public disapproval, they were
ready for it. For gamers, many of
them barely look up from World of
Warcraft.
And yet, represented or not,
there’s a lot of discussion going on
lately. Did the latest American high
school shooter have contact with
videogames? None were found in
his apartment, but that didn’t stop
the Washington Post from linking
Cho Seung Hi to the popular online
FPS CounterStrike.
And that means Jack Thompson.
So over the pond, they’re left
with court battles, wild claims, and
solemn moruning. But back home,
there’s a entirely new attitude being
taken towards games and gamers.
The British Board of Film Clas-
sification published the results of a
large survey and collated research
into the game playing habits of UK
gamers. Whilst the BBFC only have
to personally review 7% of games
releases annually, due to European
Union classification, they remain
the definitive governing body on the
country’s media.
Their findings were unusual, to
say the least, and hold a lot of credi-
bility coming as they do from such a
well-established official body. They
range from the slightly obvious
statements – “gamers play games
because they enjoy it” is stated at
one point – to the less expected. And
whilst some of their phrasing raises
a smirk, such as their attempt to
reclassify the re-re-releases of The
Sims series as “strategic life simu-
lation”, a lot of their work will be
fundamental in the ongoing media
row over violence in videogames.
The area of the report focusing on
violence discusses the matter with
various groups of gamers, ranging
from gaming parents through to
non-gaming youngsters, and every-
thing in between. Their conclusions
are very different to reports previ-
ous, in particular those conducted
by the BBC and the British School
of Motoring. Gaming is a less im-
mersive medium, according to the
report, and as such gamers tend to
keep a better grip on reality.
They also suggest that violence
in games is often “symbolic” and
usually necessary to make a game
design flow properly. They highlight
the stigma associated with such
games, but say that their findings
“make the incidence of violence in
games more comprehensible”.
Whilst the teacup storms in the
States are unlikely to spill over onto
British soil, it’s comforting to know
that our own classification system
Killings in America, J. Thompson, and GTA – but the BBFC defends UK gamers
understands the gaming psyche
properly, and has a more balanced
view on events than many others.
Whether this research helps the
view of gaming and gamers re-
mains to be seen – we don’t hold out
much hope that it will – but as far as
official conclusions go, gamers are
more than happy to accept this one.
Most telling is what lies in the last
pages, after a large section devoted
to parental concerns on gaming,
where violence is cited among other
concerns. At the end of the report, it
explains that many parents have a
“defeatist” attitude to classification,
and many suffer from “ignorance”
that leads to inappropriate material
being given to their children.
And it’s this reason that the BBFC
believes that some regulation may
be necessary – “because parents
cannot be expected to play games
themselves and come to their own
judgements”. They quote one par-
ent, saying, “We bought him GTA
when he was almost 10”.
Whether that’s a comment on the
laziness of parents, or the impos-
sibility of the situation, remains to
be seen, but the BBFC suggest that
one of the biggest issues remain-
ing is that non-gamers simply don’t
“get” games.
“When Keith Vaz, for example, is
talking about taste, nowhere in the
guidelines that have been set by
either PEGI or BBFC is taste men-
tioned”, says one industry profes-
sional, in a quote which closes the
report. “What is taste? … It is very
difficult.”
Jack Thompson, yesterday. But the Florida attorney’s attempts to ban violent games are failing in the UK
“... gamers seem not to lose awareness that
they are playing a game and do not mistake
the game for real life.”

report, “Video Games”
