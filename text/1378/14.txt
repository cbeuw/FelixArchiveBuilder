24 A man walks into a bar and sees
two pieces of meat nailed to the
ceiling. He asks the barman why
they’re there, and he replies
“if you put in a fiver, and can
get those off the ceiling, you
win all of the money collected
so far”. The man thinks about
it for a moment then replies...

Oh, look who it is. It’s that one with
the stupidly long name. In latin.
Joy of joys, that means another
impossible crossword.
Well, quite. But since there’s
probably only about twelve of you
reading this, given that term has
yet to really pull itself together, I
feel no shame.
No more so than I feel every
time I look in the mirror, at least.
Imagine having to live with having
done the things that I’ve done. It’s
horrible, isn’t it? Trust me, it is.
Althought maybe it’s best not to
trust me. In fact, just don’t.
You can’t trust a man like that.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
If you know anyone
with a gun, then
please get in touch,
we are having prob-
lems with the local
hobos in the area. I’d
consider myself a pretty gener-
ous person, I gave £20 to my local
Conservative Association just the
other month but this is immoral.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
It’s 3am and you are
suddenly compelled to
read Felix horoscopes
and see the hotdog on
the front cover and
decide to go find it. Af-
ter a 2 hour trek and many a man
misunderstanding your advances
of, “Where’s the hotdog?” You give
up and fall asleep in a bus shelter.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
To add insult to injury,
nothing happens. I
mean literally nothing,
there are unpopulated
islands in the Pacific
Ocean with more
activity. Well the other day I forgot
my keys and couldn’t get back
into my house so I had to ring my
flatmate to let me in.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
This week you discov-
er all your staff have
left your newspaper
as they have exams.
This fills you with
resentment, because
you have to spend all your wak-
ing hours in the office, and write
nearly all the content yourself. You
wish you saw the sun more.

jumper and I was like

all apathetic and shit

Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This goes out to the
guy who caught me
and my friend photo-
graphing each other
in the toilet. AND for
the record it was what
you think it was. We get off on that
shit. Wait ‘til you get on the can,
we’re gonna snap your ass. Yes,
I’m in therapy.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Speaking of prostate
milking. I have worked
out why taking a large
crap is wonderful
if you’re a guy. The
prostate is next to the
rectum and I reckon the motion of
large amounts of crap rolling next
to the prostate stimulates it. No
wonder scat porn is popular.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
We just found an old
50p. I am serious, it
was made in 1969,
BEFORE money went
decimal. This means
it is approximately
worth £30,000 and I have one and
you don’t. This means I have a
larger penis than you and it is so
large it requires prostate milking.
