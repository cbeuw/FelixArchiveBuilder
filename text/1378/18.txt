matches for the day we joined Im-
perial B at their ground to watch
their final game; they had a little
more success than us, and man-
aged to progress through the group
stage. After they’d finished their
last match we all went back to the
hotel to be greeted again by Ved’s
mum who bought more food for our
enjoyment. In the evening we took
taxis to the Bangkok Night Bazaar,
a market and entertainment venue.
The taxis in Bangkok started their
meter at about 50p and took you a
few miles for no more than another
50p. The friendly drivers also en-
gaged in exciting conversation and
will often advise you the best the
place for a “massage”. Walking the
streets of Bangkok proved a chal-
lenging task for the squad as we
were frequently mobbed by young
ladies offering various massage
treatments. Somehow, everything
in Bangkok costs 200 Baht. We had
a few drinks and a wander round
before heading back via a bar which
was a little more innocent than
the others. My sleep that night: 7
hours.
Friday saw both teams have a
break from cricket so we saw some
sights in and around Bangkok. Our
private tour bus took us first to one
of the large temples, which was fair-
ly quiet and free from tourists in the
early morning. 90% of Thai people
are practising Buddhists, and I was
fascinated to discover a good pro-
portion of men become monks for a
short while after turning 20. There
were some orange clad monks wor-
shipping in front of a giant statue of
Bhudda with a string attached to it
being held by the monks. We then
visited a park outside of Bangkok to
have a picnic lunch, again courtesy
of Ved’s family. On our way back we
visited an elephant and crocodile
park, treating us to a show portray-
ing how the elephant fit into Thai-
land’s culture and history. We were
also treated to elephants playing
footy; aside from their lack of pace
and “pooping” all over the pitch,
they actually weren’t half bad.
That night we hit the town and vis-
ited one of the more upmarket Thai
clubs. This was a humongous, mul-
ti-room electronic extravaganza.
People were friendly, drinks were
cheap and more importantly there
were plenty of women! We partied
hard until closing at 2am then head-
ed to a ‘spicy’ after-party in one of
the city’s after hours clubs. True to
its name this was one of the spiciest
parties we’d ever been to and was
much enjoyed until 5am by the re-
maining clubbers, myself included.
Luckily the next morning Imperial
A didn’t need to get up early. My
sleep that night: 5 hours.
On Saturday Imperial B went off
to play their next round of matches
while I slept. Ammar and Leon took
a day trip out to see a ruined city
and temple. I spent the afternoon
in the hotel enjoying the delights
of the pool and the relaxing heat. A
lot of the guys had suits tailored for
them in Bangkok and some of them
went off to collect them in the after-
noon. In the evening we headed out
for the RBSC Tournament Dinner,
to which we arrived very fashiona-
bly late, but were received well ow-
ing to our impeccable attire! Later
that night Imperial B went clubbing
while others, me included, went
home to catch up on sleep. My sleep
that night: 7 hours.
Sunday was our penultimate day
and granted us another chance to
enjoy the city centre. Some of us
went out to a large mall with Ved
to pick up some local merchandise,
while others remained at home.
The trip gave us another chance to
ride the SkyTrain, which again im-
pressed me with its efficiency and
cleanliness. That evening we all
took a trip to the Sky Hotel, the tall-
est building in Bangkok at 88 floors
high. A speedy lift took us right up to
the 77th floor observation deck were
we enjoyed panoramic views of the
city as though we were airborne.
Afterwards we went back to the
hotel to enjoy some incredible food
on the 22nd floor Indian restaurant,
reputed to be the best in Thailand.
We ate and drank at leisure, enjoy-
ing fine Bollywood music, to which
we were treated live. After leaving
wholly satisfied, we headed out to
the club again to enjoy a final night
in Bangkok. Most of us were tired
however, and we didn’t stay out lat-
er than closing time. My sleep that
night: 4 hours.
Monday was our final day and
those of us with stamina got up at
7am to go to the famous floating
market. The road journey was long
but took us out of Bangkok and into
more rural Thailand, which sport-
ed a higher degree of poverty and
some subsistence farming. After an
hour tour, we headed back through
morning traffic to pack up and pre-
pare to leave. In the afternoon a few
of the crew did some last minute
shopping and after a slightly unnec-
essarily stressful minibus journey
to the airport we departed the land
of smiles back to our own, quite dif-
ferent world. A world of exams and
deadlines and a rush to complete
work.
It was an unforgettable experi-
ence, in particular the hospitality
adorned on us by Ved and his fami-
ly, which gave the tour a unique and
special air. I’ll miss Thailand and
hope to explore its unique culture
in more depth in the not too distant
future.
