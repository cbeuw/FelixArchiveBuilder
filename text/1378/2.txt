Downstairs mix-up
“When the latter twin was
examined further, it turned out
it was what’s known as a true
hermaphrodite – it had ovotestes,
gonads containing both testicular
and ovarian tissue.”
PAGES 4 & 5
Exams are a-coming
“Ladies and gentlemen of the
class ‘07. If I could offer you one
tip for the future, it would be this:
do some damn work. The long
term benefits of doing some work
have been proved by scientists,
whereas the rest of my advice
has no basis more than my own
meandering experience.”
PAGES 6 & 7
Games on trial
“Did the latest American high
school shooter have contact with

Friday 27.04.07
videogames? None were found in
his apartment, but that didn’t stop
the Washington Post from linking
Cho Seung Hi to the popular online
FPS CounterStrike.”
PAGES 12 & 13
Welfare support
“Once down we headed to a
truckers café to warm up and
provoke a few of the locals
(Coming out of the Café we
quickly removed the word ‘Poofs’
from the back of the mini-bus,
but we did leave ‘English’ for our
memory).”

Cricket debauchery
“Some of the squad then enjoyed
a local massage, all sticking to
(mostly) innocent activities. In the
evening we enjoyed the delights of
Patong: pizza and some ‘speciality
dancing.’”

End of highlights
“I’m sorry, all of the staff are doing
exams at the moment, so that’s it
for highlights. And now, here’s a
song: do-do-do-da-da-da-dooo-
do-da-da-doooooo.”
What you (didn’t) miss, part 94
It’s been a busy month for those of
us staying on campus during the
Easter break. Here’s the highlights
of the last four weeks of news.
Library objections continue
Those of you currently suffering
teh pain of having to revise in the
library will have notice how un-
bearably hot the building has be-
come as the weather has warmed
up. In fact, temperatures in the up-
per floors have reached more than
30o
C in the last week; European
regulations stipulate working tem-
peratures no higher than 24o
C.
The problems stem from a rejec-
tion in March by local residents of
plans to place a new cooling plant
on the top of the library and provide
solar shading for the windows. The
objections come from people living
in the nearby Alexandria Court,
which backs onto the Library, who
claim that the solar shading will be
“too dense”, whatever that means.
College plan to resubmit the plan-
ning application, minus the solar
shading proposal, but it appears
the residents of the £2000-a-week
flats are still unsatisfied.
Key to the plans are the con-
struction of a new service tower
and cooling plant, both of which
have been deemed unsightly by
residents. It appears students will
have to suffer for a while longer be-
fore anything can be done.
Hot dogs in the Union?
The sandwich bar at lunchtime in
dBs has been closed due to poor
sales; staff had concocted a plan to
turn it into a fast-food style outlet,
possibly to compete against the
JCR, but the Union Executive re-
jected the plan. Members of Exec
cited concerns over the condition
of dBs, which has fallen somewhat
into disrepair in recent months,
arguing it was too risky to invest
in new catering facilities without
some major changes to the ambi-
ence in room. It received a repaint-
ing during the summer, but recent
foam parties have played havok
with the wooden floor.
The fast-food outlet would have
sold burgers, hotdogs, and Ben &
Jerrys icecream between 10am
and 3pm every day; however, the
same offers are to be put in place
A round-up of all the news over the Easter break; library objections, hot dogs, Union catering, and more
Sneaky Bifter next door in Da Vinci’s.
Union catering has suffered since
the new JCR facilities opened, with
both dBs and Da Vinci’s being no-
where near as full as they used to
be at lunchtimes. The scary-look-
ing mascot outside may not help to
draw in more customers.
Bar staff under threat
Student staff who work behind the
bar will no longer be offered any
further shifts if they take part in
any Union committees, following
recent events.
The ban appears to have arisen
from recent friction between staff
and the Executive Committee,
who voted to shut down dBs at
lunchtime after it became clear
it was making a substantial loss,
and vetoed the rescue plan (see
above). Any student who attends
Council or Exec, even if they are
not a member of either, risks not
being offered any more shifts.
Bar staff count as ‘casual staff’,
and as such have little legal re-
course to being effectively ‘fired’.
Union President John Collins has
promised to investigate the mat-
ter, commenting: “Speaking gen-
erally, I would regard any proposal
to limit the rights of student staff
to attend open union meetings to
be unacceptable and against the
democratic principles of our Un-
ion.” Other senior Union sources
have called the action “disgrace-
ful” and “appalling”.
The reasoning behind the move
appears to be a distaste by staff for
students setting policy that may
affect their jobs.
Police examine Union’s licence
The authority responsible for po-
licing licences to sell alcohol have
visited the Union bars and Holland
Club, citing concerns over who
is being served in the bars. After
the shake-up of licensing laws two
years ago, the police force are now
responsible for checking up on li-
cenced premises.
Ostensibly the Union is a mem-
Hotter than most holiday destinations
bers’ club, meaning it should only
serve drinks to its members. This
includes every student at the Col-
lege who hasn’t opted out of Un-
ion membership. However, until
recently the police had adopted a
‘softly-softly’ approach to this rule,
allowing regular drinkers from the
local area, including staff at the
Natural History Museum, the Sci-
ence Museum, and residents, to
drink there freely.
It appears that this period of
grace may be ending. After the
police visit, the bars now sport
signs (on the advice of the Un-
ion’s solicitors) reminding patrons
that alcohol is only to be served to
members and their guests, as well
as members of affiliated unions.
The solicitors have also argued
that if a person looks of student
age and appearance, that there is
no reason to assume they are not
a student.
The reason for the change of
approach to the Union’s licenced
premises is not entirely clear. One
Union official who wished not to be
named suggested a reason: that
the huge backlog of cases relat-
ing to the change in licencing laws
several years ago has now been
cleared, and the departments
set up to deal with this now have
“nothing better to do”.
The risk is that police will not ac-
cept the signage and arguments
of the Union’s solicitors about due
diligence, and will force the bar
staff to request student ID from
every customer, irritating students
and increasing waiting times at
the bar. For the moment, however,
the police seem satisfied with the
changes made.
Queen’s Lawn unusable?
Felix has heard from various
sources that the enormous tent on
Queen’s Lawn is to remain a per-
manent fixture until at least Octo-
ber. This means staff and students
will be unable to use the lawn dur-
ing the sunny months to come.
With the controversy last year
over plans to place portacabins on
the lawn, it is somewhat shocking
that no consultation was carried
out with staff or students.
Queen’s Lawn is one of the few
remaining green spaces on South
Kensington campus, and it is in-
deed odd that this should be cov-
ered up during Imperial’s Cente-
nary year. More on this next week.

took firefighters almost an hour to free the unhappy kid, to the great
amusement of the crowd that gathered to watch.
