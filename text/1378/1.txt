By all accounts, Imperial’s pres-
ence at the NUS conference at
the end of last month was not a
waste of time. It appears that this
year’s conference was somewhat
revolutionary.
In previous years, NUS Confer-
ence has been somewhat of a farce,
being hampered by the efforts of the
fringe left factions to push through
motions that call for, for example,
solidarity with striking workers in
other countries, and other such
things that are of little relevance to
students of the member unions.
This year, however, things had
changed. Imperial, newly joined,
found itself labelled as the “ex-
treme right” along with other
delegations from Sheffield, Kings
College, and Bristol by the leftist
factions present at Conference. Re-
spect in particular referred to our
own card-carrying Labour Party
member, Alex Guite, as a “right-
wing insurgent”. At times, the Con-
ference descended into “Respect
vs the rest”. Conference old hands
attributed this to a general distate
for Respect’s methods of stalling
and amendments to motions, and

Most productive NUS conference sees Respect confronting
“right-wing unions” and realism triumphing over idealism
a desire for change within the NUS
as a whole.
Division was not the whole story
of the Conference. Many motions
were passed unopposed, show-
ing some level of common ground
between the two warring factions;
a resolution calling for overseas
medical students to be allowed to
complete their training was passed,
for example.
Other notable defeats for the far
left included a failure to pass any
motions calling for a costly and
probably ineffective national dem-
onstration every year; instead,
the NUS is calling for a smarter
approach to fees campaigning, ac-
cepting that some level of top-up
fees will be a reality for the foresee-
able future. ICU delegate Edmund
Hunt gave a speech explaining the
need for intelligent lobbying on the
subject, arguing that students must
explain to the Government why our
education is valuable.
The cost of affiliating to the NUS
will rise to £35,000 in the next few
years, and so it is vital ICU gets
value for money from the organisa-
tion. Many pro-NUS campaigners
argued that ICU would be able to
reform the NUS from the inside;
indeed a paper was passed calling
for a full governance review of the
union. Only time will tell if this new,
more realistic NUS will prove more
effective.
