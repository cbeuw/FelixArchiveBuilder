Fellwanders wander up to Scotland
and get called ‘English poofs’
Climbing, swimming in icy rivers, and managing to avoid a sound beating at the hands of the locals
This Easter twelve Fellwanderers
embarked on a week long expedi-
tion to Wester Ross in Scotland
630miles and 18hours from London.
As usual the committee members
(myself included) were the last to
arrive at Beit Quad to meet the rest
of the group, but once the mini-bus
was packed up with equipment and
people we hit the road.
Despite intentions to stay awake
and sing along to Nick’s cheesy
music most of the group fell asleep
instantly, waking only for a quick
cheer as we passed over the Scot-
tish border and later for breakfast
in Fort William and a quick visit to
Loch Ness. At this point Alex and
Dave stripped to their swim trunks
and took a plunge while the rest
of us laughed heartily at how cold
they were. By 3pm Saturday we
had survived the long journey from
London and more importantly the
terrifying 7 mile track to the Bothy
that lead to some stiff competition
between drivers for the rest of the
week (13min10sec, rain and Meat-
loaf… most definitely the winner!).
That night the boys built a fire on
the beach, I prepared dinner, ale/
whisky was consumed and every-
one was generally satisfied and
ready for the week ahead.
On Sunday we explored the hills
and coastline around the Bothy
while Nathaniel, Nick and Dave
headed back to Inverness to pick up
Kathrin. Meanwhile those of us left
in the hills watched the biologists,
Joanna and Judith, get excited
about various lichen, moss and frog
porn!
Monday we were graced with no
rain and sunshine (as we were for
most of the week) – according to
Chris this was due entirely to my
early morning sun dances! With
good weather we couldn’t miss the
opportunity to take on An Teallach
the best ridge in Wester Ross.
An Teallach lived up to expecta-
tions and we all faced the Scram-
bling challenge to stand on Sail
Liath (954m) and Bidean a’ Ghlas
Thuill (1062m) with Alex, Dave,
Nathaniel and Richard adding on
the more serious ridge to climb
Sgurr Fiona (1060m). As it turns
out those of us that skirted around
Sgurr Fiona had a worse deal and
would have been better off scram-
bling across the top.
On Tuesday we tackled Sgurr Mor
in the Fanniachs, the tallest moun-
tain in Wester Ross, with much
the same fervour. Alex led the first
part of the route straight up (liter-
ally) Meall a’ Charasgaidh (934m)
our toughest scramble of the week
and first Munro of the day. We
then traced the ridge to Sgurr Mor
(1110m), Mairead surging ahead for
the girls, and along to Beinn Liath
Mhor (954m) where the group split;
six of us climbing to the summit and
six heading straight to the bus. Dur-
ing this hike the more ‘responsible’
members of the group determined
the quickest way off the mountain
was to slide the snow fields!
Of course sliding on the rear is
not quite so extreme and the sport
was soon up-graded to sliding head
first, lying on (dare I say it) survival
bags. At this point I have to add that
I hold the record for the most spec-
tacular way to stop – imagine hur-
tling uncontrollably down a snow
slide backwards, shooting onto the
grass, falling backwards legs flying
overhead and stopping with your
face to the ground…according to
the others ‘My God you stopped
with your teeth!!’ – Thankfully no-
one caught this on camera!
By Wednesday we needed an ex-
cuse to take a day off from scram-
bling and what better way than
whisky. Becoming tourists we drove
out to the Glenmorangie distill-
ery for a tour and some sampling.
The unfortunate thing about being
in the company of Fellwanderers
and good whisky is that you usu-
ally spend too much money and I
believe most of the group bought
something away with them – if only
drunkenness (Nathaniel)!
ThatnightIhadeveryonedressup
in kilts, sporrans and Sgain Dudhs
(created from towels/survival bags,
hats and various kitchen utensils),
we read out Burns’ ‘Address to A
Haggis’ and shared a traditional
Scots meal of Haggis, Neeps and
Tatties. I even had everyone up for
a wee Ceilidh… fantastic!
Thursday morning Richard left
us to head South while the remain-
ing eleven hikers headed on to Ben
Wyvis (1046m) the most Easterly
Munro of Wester Ross. This walk
should have been the easiest of the
week, but thankfully it was made
more challenging by thick cloud
and freezing wind. It kept us on
our toes, allowed for some proper
compass navigation and meant we
almost lost a few people due to poor
visibility.
Once down we headed to a truck-
ers café to warm up and provoke
a few of the locals (Coming out of
the Café we quickly removed the
word ‘Poofs’ from the back of the
mini-bus, but we did leave ‘English’
for our memory). We then dropped
Nick off at Garve Station for his epic
journey south, leaving ten.
Excitement filled the Geologist
Chris on Friday as he had us drive
north of Ullapool to look at some
‘sexy’ ancient rocks (his words not
mine)! Four of the boys took the
high road, but due to cloud cover
and lack of views the five girls and
Hauke opted for the lower route
around a spectacular loch. Hauke
added some spice to our journey
leaving his camera half way round
the loch and while he retrieved it
we girls discovered the pure genius
of power napping (for 1hour).
Saturday we were graced with T-
shirt weather and for our last hike
we added another two Munros to
the total, Sgurr Breac (999m) and
A’Chailleach (997m). It was on
the way down that I experienced
my spectacular ‘teeth stopping’
moment.
If this wasn’t enough I was then
thrown in a loch as a Thank-you for
organising such a successful trip in
the best location in the UK. Too bad
the trip had to come to an end….
only Sunday left, most of which we
spent driving back to London, via
another Distillery, singing to ‘the
final countdown’ across the border
and sleeping! In summary I can say
the trip was fantastic, the weather
unbelievable and fun was had by
all. Let’s hope the summer tour to
Switzerland is just as successful
– Tim you have your work cut out!
During term time Fellwanderers
organise fortnightly weekend
trips around the UK and Sunday
walks around the neighbouring
counties of London. If you are in-
terested in joining Fellwanderers,

Scarbrough at fellsoc@imperial.

Fellwanders. I see the fells, but very little wandering appears to be occurring. In fact, it looks like hijinks of the first order. Fie, I say!
