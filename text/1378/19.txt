S
Cricket Club takes on the world
During Easter 2007, Imperial Cricket
embarked on what was probably one
of the best cricket tours ever. The 13
strong squad went on a 10 day tour
of Thailand where we competed in
the Royal Bangkok Sports Club Sixes
Tournament featuring international
teams such as Bahrain and Mal-
dives. Despite the stiff opposition and
intense heat, one of Imperial’s teams
made it to the quarter finals of the
Plate competition.
The tour began with a warm up
match against the Royal Bangkok
Sports Club – one of the best league
teams in Thailand. Upon arrival at
the ground, any tiredness was very
quickly overcome by sentiment; the
ground was easily one the most beau-
tiful any of us had ever played on.
Lush green pitches were surrounded
by palm trees with a backdrop of tow-
ering skyscrapers and cloudless blue
skies. Simply put, the grounds were
truly magnificent.
Under the roasting mid-day sun the
match was soon underway. RBSC
won the toss and elected to bat first.
They got off to a flyer but Imperial
soon gained control as Jibran Ahmed
made good use of the new ball to take
two quick wickets – despite his in-
jured knee. Ali Ahmed made the per-
fect start to his Imperial debut with
an early wicket while The pressure
continued to build as Leon Loveridge
claimed an early victim while skipper
Thil set the standard with an incred-
ible diving catch followed shortly by
a run out.
Despite the early breakthrough,
the runs kept flowing and the game
was beginning to get away from us
– that is until Almaher Shelley was
handed the ball. Al bowled a selection
of jaffers and wides leading to an im-
pressive 5 wicket haul. RBSC strug-
gled to cope with Al’s potent mix of
pace, swing and slower balls; one
by one the sound of the ball striking
the stumps sent the batsmen walk-
ing back to the pavilion. RBSC were
bowled out in 34 overs leaving Impe-
rial the daunting task of chasing 241
in just 35 overs.
After tucking into our fried rice at
tea (some of us enjoying more than
one serving i.e. Anura) we set off to
the crease but never managed to
stamp our authority. Wickets tum-
bled and some dodgy calling from
Al ensured he was no contender for
man of the match as he intentionally
ran-out the captain. The only real re-
sistance came from Leon Loveridge
and Ved Vyas who both batted with
great responsibility to keep the oppo-
nents on their toes. In fact Ved clear-
ly wasn’t intending on batting very

long as he decided that boxers alone
would suffice to keep his abdominal
guard in place until he was out. This
option proved painful as he dived into
his crease avoiding a run-out. This
was only the first of Ved’s abdominal
guard problems during the tour.
Imperial were all out for 143 as Nick
claimed Leon was trapped “plumb”
in front the wickets. Ved top scored
with an impressive innings of 36 on
his home ground and Leon finished
with a respectable 26. Although we
were up against strong opposition,
we put up a good fight and showed
great resilience, however, we never
managed to get a hold of the game
and the opposition’s suitability to the
conditions took the match out of our
hands.
