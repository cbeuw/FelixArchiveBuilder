Revision getting you down? Exams l
Thee Olde Tymer
“If I could offer
you one tip for
the future, it
would be this:
do some damn
work.”
L
adies and gentlemen of
the class ‘07. If I could
offer you one tip for the
future, it would be this:
do some damn work. The
long term benefits of doing some
work have been proved by scien-
tists, whereas the rest of my ad-
vice has no basis more than my
own meandering experience.
Organise your notes, but don’t
organise your day. Sleep well. Go
to the library, but leave before
it makes you dehydrated; go to
the pub, but leave before you get
drunk. Floss. Be kind to your brain;
you’ll miss it when it’s gone. Don’t
waste your time on panicking;
sometimes you’re ahead of sched-
ule, and sometimes you’re behind.
Get plenty of water. Keep hold of
the few precious revision buddies
you have, and always remember
that notes are for sharing. Work
hard, but remember to play harder
once it’s all over. Don’t forget that
it will all be over at some point.
Shower. Regularly. And I do
mean it. Remember the equations
you learn, but forget the deriva-
tions. Worry about the big things,
not the little things. Eat well. Get
to know your lecturers; they can
give you valuable hints about what
might be on the paper. Past papers
are your friends; look at as many
of them as you can.
Acceptcertaininalienabletruths;
your notes will be unintelligable,
what you’ve learned the most will
not be on the exam, and you can’t
always answer every question. Be
happy. Respect the upper years;
they know more than you.
Maybe you’ll pass, maybe you
won’t. Don’t be afraid of failure;
hope for success. Don’t worry
about the exam; or, if you must
worry, remember that worrying is
about as effective as trying to solve
an equation by chewing gum.
Advice is a form of nostalgia,
dispensing it is a way of fishing
the past from the disposal, wiping
it off, painting over the ugly parts
and recycling it for more than it’s
worth. But trust me on the doing
of work.

The three Ws: Work, Work, and... uhm, Work
As a doctor, I am often asked: “Doc-
tor, my palms are sweating profuse-
ly, my stomach is rotating rapidly
despite not eating anything since
that chicken’n’bacon yesterday,
and I have a tense, nervous head-
ache like that one in the adverts.
What’s wrong with me?” Fear not,
my less-well-educated chum; you
do not have cancer (or even her-
pes, though you might want to get
those weird spots checked outt).
No, indeed, you have a classic case
of exam stress, commonly known
as ohshitiamfuckeditis. Now, due
to my colossal knowledge acquired
as an undergraduate (inbetween
drinking myself into a stupor in the
Reynolds Bar), I can suggest to you
a number of possible treatment op-
tions. Listen closely, ignoramus.
RELAX.
Not in the ‘Frankie Goes To Holly-
wood’ sense (incidentally, did you
know that song is about orgasms?),
but in the ‘be calm’ sense. It’s easy
to get into a mad panic because
The Doctor (is in)
you don’t know equation 11.4 from
lecture 87 of your structural fluid
mechanics with quantum misdirec-
tion course and lose sight of the fact
that (hopefully) you know plenty of
other stuff about said subject. If
you find yourself getting panicked,
try calmly reminding yourself how
much work you’ve already done.
Take a break, go for a walk in the
park, phone your mum. Then come
back to your books refreshed and
ready to go.
PLAN.
I can’t stress this one enough. Even
if you aren’t one of nature’s plan-
ners, try it. Write out a list of what
needs to be learnt, and how long
you think it’ll take you to do it (plus
a chunky fudge factor, since work
always expands to fill the available
time). That way you’ll have a nice
mental picture of how much you’ve
got to do.
EAT.
Yes, I know it seems redundant. It’s
easy to forget to eat properly be-
cause skipping out for lunch would
mean stepping away from those
never-ending reams of notes, but
you can’t function on snacks from
Facebook
As addictive as crack-laced
heroin rolled into a cigarette.
Studies have shown it will eat
up roughly 75% of your revi-
sion time; writing inanities on
your friends’ walls can be very
time-consuming. Just say no.
Xbox/Wii/DS/Gameboy/PS2
Since this is a pretty geeky
place, it’s likely you own one
of the above. However tempt-
ing it may be to try and finish
New Super Mario Bros (finding
all the secrets), resist. You’ll
find your day vanishes faster
than you can say “oh fuck I’ve
done no work at all”.
Alcohol
Don’t spend all day building
up neural connections only to
burn them all away with a six-
hour cider binge that ends with
you losing your notes (and
your shoes) in the park (true
story).
Denial
Not just a river in Egypt (snare
roll). Thanks, I’ll be here all
week. The biggest revision
killer by far. There’s nothing
like pretending that really un-
pleasant course taught by the
lecturer with the impenetrable
accent will be a piece of piss.
Revision
killers
the library vending machines for a
month. Trust me on this one. See
the opposite page for some things
to try. Remember, crisps, Coke,
Snickers and coffee do not consti-
tute food groups.
SLEEP
.
Staying up all night doesn’t help,
and may in fact hamper your abil-
ity to work. Try to get to bed at a
regular time, and rise at roughly
the same time every day. If you’re
feeling adventurous (and have no
lectures to go to) you can try some-
thing called polyphasic sleep. Basi-
cally, you adjust so that you sleep
for 20-25 minutes every four hours,
giving you six naps through the day
and night. Theoretically, this should
give you more time to work, and
most tiredness should dissipate
after about ten days. I managed it
once for a week before crumbling.
SEX.
Sex fills your brain full of dopamine,
and makes you feel generally awe-
some – just what you need. How-
ever, this is Imperial, so we won’t
assume you’ll be with a partner.
Just remember to wash your hands
afterwards.
Don’t sleep in the library, you filthy bugger. Go home!
“Sweaty palms,
churning
stomach, deep-
seated feelings
of dread, and a
tense, nervous
headache?
You’re just
experiencing
exam-o-phobia.”
Library do’s and don’ts
DO
Shower before you go. It’s bloody
hard to concentrate when the
person sat next to you smells like
a hot day in a farmyard.
DON’T
Initiate games of keepy-uppy
with balls of screwed-up paper.
Yes, yes, we’re all very impressed
with your display of masculine
talent, but it won’t get you any
play. Do some work.
DO
Get there early. According to my
research, if you’re not in before
8am, you’ve got about as much
chance as finding a free space to
work as you have of finding £300
in your coat pocket.
DON’T
Leave your crap lying around so
others can’t take your space. I
mean, come on, you insensitive
bastard. Other people have to
work, you know.
DO
Think about other places to work.
Here’s a quick list of lesser-known
revision spots: Chemistry com-
mon rooms (2nd floor), Physics
labs on level 3 (open and nearly
always empty), back half of the
SAF (nice cushions on the bench-
es), The Builders Arms (known to
be friendly to revising students),
and the British Library (long way
to go, but plenty of space).
DON’T
Even think about bringing food
upstairs. It stinks, we’re all hun-
gry, and you’re just making a
mess. Go eat in the Haldane Col-
lection if you really must.
