After holding up two trains
and taking a combined six
hour journey, the Imperial
College men’s first team were
victorious against Essex.
With six and a half play-
ers, we encountered our
first opponent: delays on
the Piccadilly Line. Reliably,
London public transport
left our team five minutes
to change, warm up and
impress the Essex ladies
before tip-off.
A capacity crowd of 30
witnessed a tit-for-tat first
quarter with multiple lead
changes against a full ten
player Essex team. Weary of
being run into the ground,
Imperial used tactical substi-
tutions by our non-existent
coach (applications to our
Student Activities Centre
pigeonhole please) to keep
us sprightly.
Spirits were high going into
half time with an eight point
lead. This was short-lived as
Essex made a third quarter
run and left the score tied at
52 as we entered the fourth
quarter.
With the loss of one of our
players to the Chelsea game,
the Imperial boys were
searching for an answer,
and they found it in the
form of zone defence. This
threw Essex for a loop and
revived the Imperial offence.
Frustrated and physically
outmatched, the Essex play-
ers took to fouling, which left
their four best players out on
the bench.
It was a hard-fought game,
but Imperial triumphed with
a final score of 80-66, thanks
largely to the 39 points posted
by Ian Bonzani and the 21
recorded by last minute draft
Laurie Neale.

Well, what went wrong, I hear
you cry? That’s something
the ladies’ first team were
wondering themselves last
Wednesday. The team never
really got in to the swing
of this match, and, to put it
bluntly, we were a bit pants.
Arriving at Harlington, the
team had time to warm up
thoroughly, and our “dynamic
stretching” was clearly a
hit with the Chelsea youth
players (our new fan club).
We came out strong in the
first half, although not at our
best. Flush and Tyson pro-
vided excellent vocal coach-
ing on the pitch and were
doing their best to get us in
to the game. Unfortunately,
our captain Yoda was not feel-
ing well. Nevertheless, she
found strength from the force
and played on. Before half
time came, two short corners
had produced two goals for
Imperial. Some might call it
textbook hockey, with excel-
lent injection from Womble,
spot on stick-stopping from
Embryo and immense strikes
from Flush!
At the start of the second
half, the score was 2-2. Despite
notable performances from
Tyson (man of the match) and
Spellcheck, the winning goal
continued to elude Imperial,
and Hertfordshire went on to
score a third. In the final five
minutes of the game, there
was a collective awakening
of the team and we really did
play well, but unfortunately
our last ditch effort wasn’t
enough to get the win. As
the final whistle blew, one
Hertfordshire player proved
she had truly played to the
point of exhaustion by fainting
on the pitch. Was the fatigue
down to the fact that she had
contributed such a sterling
effort, or was it perhaps a
cunning ploy to engage in
some mild flirtation with the
strapping young man who
carried her to the sideline? I
guess we’ll never know!
It was a shame to lose this
game, but we continue on,
heads held high, to face the
wrath of Royal Holloway next
week. Whatever it was that
robbed us of our mojo for the
Hertfordshire game, be it the
dreary London weather, the
depression of watching oth-
ers graduate (whilst we still
have mountains of work to do)
or simply the excitement of
Freshers’ Week wearing off,
I’m sure we will get it back
and be eating goal pie again
soon.

Hockey ladies lose mojo
UCL Men’s 4th 2
Imperial Men’s 4th 1
By Michael Nicholson
This was the Fourths’ first
challenge against one of our
serious promotion rivals, and
despite starting the game
well, we were eventually
denied any points thanks to
another piece of highly dubi-
ous refereeing.
As usual we started slowly,
but luckily we held firm and
gradually dug in to get a
decent foothold in the game,
culminating in another goal
for Shwin. Most of the credit
for the goal should go to
Aldridge-Carlos who blasted
down the left wing with all
the grace of a giraffe on some
of Adrian Mutu’s special
brew. Eventually he made it
to the box where he hit a
cross-shot which the keeper
(the identical twin of our
own Tom Clifton) parried to
the feet of Shwin’s, who just
had to roll it in. One-nil and
cruising.
Sadly we were having
trouble at set pieces, with
free headers being gifted at
every corner and free kick.
Eventually, one of their big
defenders got his head on to a
corner from the left, resulting
in the ball bouncing around
the box. Sadly their striker
reacted more quickly than
Shinguards, and hooked in a
decent finish past a helpless
Vanni.
At half time Ant was
replaced in midfield by Dave
and, with the rain continu-
ing to pour, it became evident
that the next goal would be
vital. Imperial were riding
their luck with Vanni mak-
ing some good saves, and
Shinguards blocking one on
the line. Sadly UCL eventu-
ally got the crucial goal, when
their lanky striker, and the
proud owner of another mul-
let (what is it with us and mul-
leted strikers), ran from an
obvious offside position and
rounded to Vanni to score.
Ant, refereeing, had to go with
the decision of their linesman,
the “ginger whinger”, and the
goal stood.
Still we had chances to pull
the game back, with Dave
shanking a half chance, and
the ‘keeper smothering well
from Jai. The final whis-
tle came just too soon, and
Imperial were subjected,
unluckily, to their first defeat
of the season. Still, heads up
boys! Lots to play for.

Fourths undone by
yet another mullet
Imperial Men’s 4th 3
LSE Men’s 4th 3
By Michael Nicholson
It was a sad day for Imperial’s
Fourths as they failed to beat
a decent LSE side despite
playing, in the words of cap-
tain Vanni, their “sexiest foot-
ball” of the season.
In response to the first
defeat at the hands of UCL,
the Fourths made a number
of changes. Controversially,
Aldridge-Carlos kept his
place at left-back ahead of
the returning Ed Goh, whose
sore something-or-other must
have healed. Michael Hughes
slipped into central midfield,
alongside Dave the Hippy,
who turned up to the match
wearing shirt, tie, and… flip-
flops. To the amusement of
everyone, the aforementioned
footwear forced him to suffer
the indignity of rejection from
the fine establishment that is
Cheapskates.
To the match itself, and for
the fourth time in four games
fortheFourths,itwasImperial
who got themselves in front. A
free kick was awarded on the
right-hand edge of the box,
and while the defence were
muttering amongst them-
selves about how this one
would really suit a left-footer,
up stepped Shwin to loop a
right-footed shot over the wall
and into the net. There’s a
reason why defenders aren’t
allowed near any free kicks.
Seconds later, the Hippy
burst through midfield and
hit a decent shot from range,
with his now fully clothed
right foot. Much to his annoy-
ance, it crashed off the bar
and found its way to Chris
on the left. Being a physicist,
Chris measured the wind-
speed, checked his angles and
smacked a goal of the season
contender into the top right
corner.
Two-nil and coasting,
Vanni’s team-talk centred on
not conceding stupid goals.
How that would come back
to haunt him. Two minutes
after the restart, LSE’s afro-
haired sub got the break of
the ball on the corner of the
box. Vanni was caught in no
man’s land, and to his credit,
the afro threaded an amaz-
ing finish around Vanni and
into the corner. The response
from Imperial was immedi-
ate though, as Shwin restored
the two-goal advantage with a
deflected shot after good work
from Perry, who had replaced
the terminally injured Jai at
half time.
Still Imperial’s penchant
for losing soft goals came
back to haunt them, as first a
mix-up allowed the Afro time
and space on the right, and
his cross picked out his fel-
low striker who struck with
a good right foot shot. Then,
unbelievably, for the third
time in the match, Imperial
were caught out by a long ball
over the top. Vanni misjudged
the flight of the ball, and his
hesitation was fatal as the
LSE striker got there first and
bent it around the stranded
‘keeper to even things up.
That’s how it ended, but
Imperial can take heart from
another great display. As
soon as the back line learn
to protect the good work of
the forwards, victories, and
hopefully promotion, will be
certain.
