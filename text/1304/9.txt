Recruitment season may
have left you with the impres-
sion that employment oppor-
tunities exist solely within the
City. Imperial is specifically
targeted by the City institu-
tions, which is great if that’s
the route you want to take,
but not so good for diversity
at recruitment events.
So, to remind myself that
the choice is not only between
banking and management
consultancy, I started to jot
down some other professions.
The first thing that came to
mind was intelligence work!
Spooks has left me a little
obsessed, but it is compulsive
viewing. Just as a career in
medicine is not likely to lead
to a life out of ER, I must also
remind myself here that the
reality probably isn’t quite
the same as the programme.
However, it is a fact that the
intelligence agencies are
increasing their recruitment.
Working in the Civil Service
probably sounds slightly more
down to earth. I have never
thought of the Civil Service as
a potential employer and only
had a vague idea of the differ-
enttypesofworktheydo.After
looking at their website I was
impressed with the variety of
opportunities. Departments
include International
Development, the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office,
the Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory
(DSTL), the Forensic Science
Service, the Cabinet Office,
the Charity Commission and
loads more.
There is also a Fast Stream
option for graduates who, if
accepted onto this accelerat-
ed training and development
program, are earmarked for
senior management (see
www.faststream.gov.uk).
Options for Fast Streamers
include general manager
or policy advisor positions
in any government depart-
ment, joining the Diplomatic
Service, working in EU insti-
tutions on European policy
issues or working in science
and engineering depart-
ments. It all sounded very
interesting to me, and they
certainly think so – the home
page reads “The Civil Service
is a whole world you never
dreamed existed. It’s a world
you’ll want to join”.
Further ideas for my list
came from a Proctor &
Gamble (P&G) presenta-
tion I attended. There are
a number of different ‘func-
tions’ such as marketing and
customer business develop-
ment, but surprisingly I found
myself drawn to research
and development (“surpris-
ingly”, as once I finish my
PhD the sight of a lab bench
is very likely to make me run
a mile). It turns out that R&D
doesn’t necessarily mean
being stuck in a laboratory.
A past Imperial PhD student
who now works in the R&D
division of P&G UK explains
how she has been in the labo-
ratory once only since she
arrived. Although you can opt
to work at the bench, other
jobs include developing ideas
for products (by using infor-
mation from experimental
results and also market anal-
ysis and consumer research),
and matching existing P&G
technologies to ways of mak-
ing new products. So if you
don’t see yourself as a “lab
scientist”, but don’t want to
waste your scientific back-
ground either, perhaps R&D
in a multinational consum-
er products company will
appeal.
Felix Careers will have
more on P&G next time, along
with a focus on media.

Where will the Careers sec-
tion take you this week?
Obviously we don’t expect
freshers to get bogged down
with the nitty-gritty applica-
tions-and-interviews career
stuff. But even if you are
embarking on possibly the
best years of your life, you
have to have in the back of
your mind that pot of gold at
the end of the journey: your
dream career.
The transition from student
lifetotheworldofworkneedn’t
be painful and so here we are
to tell you about CV and appli-
cations secrets. Most large
graduate firms use the ‘appli-
cation, first interview, assess-
ment centre’ model for their
recruitment. Be prepared for
this: 27% of these companies
use telephone pre-screening,
more than 40% have a sin-
gle deadline (typically either
December or January),
whilst one third opt for year-
round recruitment. One third
of large companies use online
psychometric, numeracy or
verbal reasoning tests (Real
World Magazine, September
issue). Let’s then get into
this prospective: you are a
product and so you need to
market yourself well to tempt
employers to invest in you.
More or less, everybody
knows how to write a CV
if you consider it to be just
a chronological series of
events occurring in your life.
However, if you aim high, it is
not that simple.
A good CV is an essential
tool for anyone on the job
market. It is a written snap-
shot that succinctly describes
your experience and educa-
tion. But an outstanding CV
is more than just good writing
and a list of activities. A truly
outstanding CV is custom-
tailored to the position you
want, presenting information
in order of relevance to the
position.
Here are some tips that I
learnt from Jake Harding,
a member of Elliot Penny, a
company that delivers stra-
tegic consultancy, coaching,
facilitation and training:
● A good CV consists of two
pages and can only have a
third page for references.The
first page has to be power-
ful, therefore you must do
a lot better than a common
chronological CV. You do not
want the employer to have to
turn the page to find out you
are brilliant! Concentrate the
most effective information on
the first page and target the
CV for the job you are apply-
ing for.
● Highlight what you are
good at and include evidence
to show you have the main
skills most relevant to the
job.
● Build an idea of who you
are and focus on standing
out from your contemporar-
ies. Ask yourself: how can I
convince them to choose me
among others?
● Emphasise how you per-
sonally would add value to
the company. State what you
want to achieve, what you
have to offer, why you deserve
the job, and what you have
succeeded in so far.
● Show figures: encourage
the employer to read further
by giving your achievements
in numbers. If you do not
have work experience, then
explain where else in your
life you have developed your
skills.
● The second page should
include a concise overview of
your academic background. It
has to be chronological, with
no gaps.
● Put your interests, but
only those out of the ordi-
nary, that will provide you
with something to talk about
during your interview so that
they will remember you. For
example, leading a moun-
taineering trip would indicate
motivation, leadership and
strategic-thinking. But citing
“going to the cinema, socialis-
ing or going to the pub” won’t
differentiate you from thou-
sands of others. Remember,
you have got to stick out from
the crowd.
Congratulations! You have
just received notification that
you have been selected for
an interview. Your first task
is to review the key respon-
sibilities for the job, and as
you begin to prepare for the
interview, you may realize
that you need to gain more
clarity about what is impor-
tant to you in a job, what skills
you have and prefer to use,
and whether is the right job
for you.
If appropriate, think about
your role as the leader of a
successful, achieving team
and recognize your achieve-
ments; think about what you
did to direct, inspire, make or
enable this to happen. Review
the key abilities required for
the job to identify which of
those you possess. You will
want to emphasise these
capabilities with your expe-
rience to illustrate that you
match the requirements.
Finally, you may want to list
your questions about the job
so that you can ask these to
the interviewer.
Thus, in order to ensure
that you are prepared, be
sure that you:
● Know who is going to inter-
view you, and his or her posi-
tion in the company.
● Know when and where the
interview is being held, and
how to get there.
● Know what you need to
bring to the interview (a copy
of your CV is recommended).
● Get plenty of rest.
If you think this all sounds
like hard work, fear not, as
you are now sowing the seeds
that you will soon reap. So
make the most of it!

CV DOs:
● Sell yourself – you only get
one chance to make a first
impression, so make sure it
counts
● Be original – your CV
needs to stand out from
others
● Keep it short and simple
– you only have 20 to 30 secs
to impress
● Use bullet points
● Check the spelling of every
word
● Give evidence and exam-
ples to back up everything
you say. Quantify when
possible
CV DON’Ts:
● Overexaggerate your
experience – employers will

– your marital status should
not affect your ability to do
the job
● Use flashy graphics or
coloured paper
● Use abbreviations
● Begin phrases with “I” or
use long sentences
● Write your life story
Careers in the City are not the only option for Imperial graduates. This week, we
take a look elsewhere
