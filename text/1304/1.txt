Next term’s Varsity match,
already one of the most pres-
tigious events in Imperial
College sport, is set for expan-
sion. Under new proposals,
eight matches will be played
in one day across three differ-
ent sports to celebrate friend-
ly rivalry, good sportsmanship
and enjoyment of the game.
Since 2003, the annual
Varsity match has seen
Imperial Medicals Rugby
Football Club take on
Imperial College Union Rugby
Football Club for the JPR
Williams Cup. The cup is
named after former Wales full
back and St Mary’s old boy
John Peter Rhys Williams,
who made 55 appearances for
his country during a success-
ful career.
The event was originally
conceived to promote friendly
rivalry and good sportsman-
ship between the two sides,
whilst also celebrating the
high standard of rugby they
can produce. In February this
year, the match was played
at Richmond in front of over
800 students, staff and guests.
The Medicals triumphed
43–19 to retain the cup after
winning the inaugural compe-
tition 12–0.
The 2005 JPR Williams
Cup match will take place
at Richmond on Wednesday
16 February. Under the new
plans, there will be seven
other ‘Varsity matches’
on the same day, played at
Harlington, each putting an
Imperial College team up
againsttheSchoolofMedicine.
The other teams involved will
be the men’s rugby second
and third teams, the men’s
hockey first and second
teams, the women’s hockey
first team, and the men’s foot-
ball first and second teams.
For logistical reasons, other
sports cannot be included as

Dangerous drinks
“There still remains a lot of
confusion and misinforma-
tion about what happens in
an attack and what happens
if you are unfortunate enough
to have your drink spiked.”

“Suffice to say that the plot
was predictable and the
characters were about as
interesting as the Sherfield
Building.”

yet, but this could change in
future years as the Varsity
match day could be expanded
still further.
Richard Walker, Deputy
President (Clubs and
Societies) of Imperial College
Union, told Felix: “It’s a fan-
tastic idea. By expanding
the Varsity match to more
sports, we will attract more
people to play sport and to
spectate. This will bring peo-
ple together and promote a
greater interest and a better
sense of identity for sport at
Imperial.”
Theproposalswererevealed
to Felix by Morten Olesen,
vice chairman of Imperial
College Union’s Athletic Clubs
Committee, who said: “It’s
such a good way to promote
the rivalry between the two
sides without any ill feeling.”
Supporters will be able
to purchase tickets either
for the whole day or just for
the JPR Williams Cup. Prices
will depend on sponsorship
but should lie in the region
of £5.
Coaches will leave South
Kensington and Charing
Cross Hospital for Harlington
early in the afternoon. Hockey,
football and rugby matches
will take place there simulta-
neously, with supporters free
to walk between pitches and
the bar, enjoying whichever
sport they choose.
Later, supporters and par-
ticipants alike will be driven
to Richmond for the JPR
Williams Cup match, before
returning to Imperial College
Union, where presentations
will be made. There will be
a points system in place
throughout the day, with a
special award presented to
the overall winning team.

of identity for
sport at Imperial”
