Issue 1303 solution
A
London Colleges League
By Sebastian Venus
Another year, another suc-
cess, and the Imperial College
running machine rolls on.
Although the St Mary’s run-
ners did do rather well, they
have a distinct advantage in
that they all study degrees in
running – how lame.
Thus, despite the race win-
ner being some smuggled
Kenyan athlete in a St Mary’s
vest, Imperial were the best
among the London colleges,
and we won the moral vic-
tory: the epic ‘King of the Hill’
battle. The annual sprint to
the top of Parliament Hill
(which you may or may not
know is the highest point in
London) at the very begin-
ning of the race was this year
won by our very own Dave
‘suicide’ Xiong, pipping Chris
‘Mullet’ Mullington to the
peak’s summit.
The club’s new recruits
backed up the heroic efforts
of old timers such as Chris,
Gavin (very old) and Ankit
by triumphing over the
other London participants.
However, I personally
became concerned as the St
Mary’s runners forgot that
they were there to run and
not to hit on professional ath-
letes (us) – they will have to
learn that “buttock-pinching”
does not constitute sporting
behaviour.
The race began in tradi-
tional style with the ritual
chanting of “Gary Hoare”
from the Imperial team, in
remembrance of the past leg-
end who came last in every
race but won all the post-race
drinking competitions, and
not without a party trick or
two.
We were boosted by our
highest turnout ever, with
notably spectacular perform-
ances from newbies Danny
and Nick. Congratulations
also to all the new mem-
bers on their virgin races
for the club. Needless to say,
racing of an alcoholic nature
continued until late into
the night, culminating in a
deserved victory for Imperial
– we may not be able to do
degrees in running, but
there’s always one event
we’re sure to win.
