Look after
your drink
In the last few years, drink spiking
and sexual assault have been on the
increase. The use of alcohol or other
drugs in order to make a person less
able to resist unwanted sexual con-
tact has become more widespread
and continues to do so.
The substances used for this pur-
pose are often tasteless, colourless
and odourless, making them almost
undetectable when they are put
into drinks. This of course means
that more and more people who are
socialising need to be more care-
ful of their surroundings and more
aware of where their drink is.
Although the issue is now becom-
ing more widely spoken about, there
still remains a lot of confusion and
misinformation about what happens
in an attack and what happens if
you are unfortunate enough to have
your drink spiked.
It should also be noted that many
such attacks occur when people put
stronger alcohol into drinks, such
as putting a strong spirit into some-
thing like lager. This is a particular
concern as alcohol is so widely avail-
able.
It is widely believed that all such
attacks are committed against
women, however it was reported
this year that 12% of calls to the
Roofie Foundation (a helpline that
provides support to those who have
experienced drug-assisted rape)
were in fact from men.
When you are out and about, it is
vitally important that you are aware
of what to look out for with regard to
drink spiking. Below are some ways
to keep yourself and your fellow
students safe.
● Go out in a group and have a
‘sober’ person.
● Keep your drinks with you at all
times.
● Don’t drink anything that has
been left unattended.
● Look out for unusual behaviour in
your friends.
● Stay away from high risk areas.
If you think that your drink has been
spiked:
● Find someone you trust.
● Show them you feel ill. If need be,
make yourself sick.
● Don’t leave on your own, as you
may pass out.
● If you can’t find a friend, make a
scene.
If you have any more detailed
concerns or questions regard-
ing this issue, contact the Student
Advice Service on 020 7594 8067 or

STUDENT ADVISER
Much of my time is spent in meet-
ings. In general I hate meetings.
Meetings are a mechanism for like-
minded, similarly-suited bureau-
crats to pretend to ‘work’ whilst
actually doing nothing more than
ingesting copious amounts of tea
and biscuits to add to their insula-
tion layers.
Senate is different. As the College’s
academic governing body, it has
overall responsibility for education-
al provision. It’s the second most
important meeting I attend. And I
actually enjoy it.
Much of College can feel sterile
and corporate. Senate still offers a
genuine forum for debate and dis-
cussion. Academics can (and often
do) ‘kick off’ in a major way on some
matter that appeared to be simple
and non-contentious. Many a battle
on a student issue has been won (or
lost) on the (in)ability of the student
representatives to manipulate the
show.
Why am I talking about Senate?
I wanted to raise the profile of the
‘unseen’ side of student representa-
tion. Students all too easily see the
commercial services (bars, shops,
etc) that we run as a Union. To a
large extent, they see the clubs and
societies that are so prolific here
at Imperial. On occasion, students
might even notice a political issue.
What people don’t see so much is
representation of academic matters
– our raison d’etre.
The next Senate meeting is consid-
ering issues from access to examina-
tion scripts to staff redundancies in
the life sciences. Add on a sprinkling
of careers services, teaching quality
in agricultural sciences, ICT, profes-
sional development and widening
access, and you get a fairly meaty
agenda covering broad spectrum of
academic activity.
Get your say!
Senate’s business is mainly over-
sight. Most of the ‘work’ is being
done in subcommittee meetings, all
of which have student reps. Herein
lies my first problem: postgraduate
students, and research postgrads in
particular. Whilst many of you are
involved as Union officers, we have
a dire shortage of postgraduate
reps. This gives us headaches when
we need student reps for commit-
tees (we often send undergraduates
or someone with no legitimacy as an
elected academic representative).
We have vacancies for research
student reps in life sciences,
physical sciences and medicine.
Nominations are now open for a
second set of by-elections. If you
are a research postgraduate stu-
dent reading this then please,
please, please, consider standing or
finding a colleague who will do so.
Visit www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.
There’s a free box of Harrods dough-
nuts for the first postgraduate to get
themselves nominated for election.
Go on, it’s easy. It’ll only take two
minutes to send one email. And
I really want to buy you some
doughnuts.
Of course, not all student
representatives get to attend all
College meetings. The Union’s inter-
nal processes are just as impor-
tant for formulating policy. When I
attend Senate, I need to know
what the opinion of Union Council
and other bodies is on various
issues so that I can represent them.
The same is true of all student rep-
resentatives on all committees.
At present, the Union’s ability is
handicapped by not having a full
Council. If we do not have enough
properly elected members then it
undermines the legitimacy of the
Union’s policy-making. It increases
the danger that opinions formed by
the Union end up representing a
small clique. That’s why it is incred-
ibly important that we have a full
Council.
So please, look again at the elec-
tions to Union Council. Nominations
for the new by-elections are open.
Visit www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.
Think about the doughnuts on
offer. Then please send an email
to elections@ic.ac.uk telling us
that you want to stand. This time it
might help if more of you submit a
manifesto...
At the end of the day, don’t think
of Union elections as “political”.
The Union is a integral part of
the governance of the College.
Union Officers are involved at all
levels of decision-making on mat-
ters that directly affect students.
If you don’t take part, you lose
your say.
