Five famous physicists
What does Stephen Hawking think the most important advances of science were?

Hawking’s grand tour of modern
astronomy singles out just five of the
physics greats: Copernicus, Galileo,
Kepler, Newton and Einstein. We
start with a taste of Copernicus
and his controversial theory of a
heliocentric universe before moving
to meaty biography detailing the
young physician’s Polish upbring-
ing and entrance into the clergy,
amongst finer details that Hawking
narrates with enthusiasm.
A celebration of Galileo’s work
takes up the next chapter which
includes the transcripted adjura-
tion that Galileo was publicly forced
to announce prior to his imprison-
ment. Hawking neatly intertwines
the development of Galileo’s split
social interests and support and
rejection of Copernican astronomy
with an account of the astronomer’s
ambitious life.
Kepler occupies the chapter three
spot in Hawking’s team for his leg-
endary avocations of the Copernican
heliocentric universe and concern
for the five platonic solids. Here
Kepler’s interest in the universe’s
mathematical ratios is explained,
and we learn that each planet in
fact has its very own musical har-
mony! If only Hawking had thought
of including sound effects...
Newton comes next in Hawking’s
hall of astro-fame, where Hawking
points out that (just like the aver-
age student), Newton conducted
experiments in his own bedroom:
observing prisms and light and
generally making clever theories.
Hawking chronicles the scientist’s
life and work with a pronounced
admiration, and here the book also
includes quite hefty extracts of the
Principia.
Einstein concludes the collec-
tion, paving the way for Hawking
to explain what the current status
of astronomy is. Hawking teases
us with a little algebra to explain
Einstein’s theory of relativity, which
you will either deliberately leave
open on the coffee table in order
to look rather clever, or decisively
slam shut with a horrified gasp.
A disappointingly short discussion
is included in an attempt to bring
us up to date with more recent
developments, and this is the one
area where Hawking lacks. Whilst
interesting suppositions are raised,
such as “What happens if you could
go back in time and kill your grand-
father before your father or mother
were conceived?” Hawking fails to
examine these in much depth and
we arrive at the endnotes a little
hastily.
This is, however, a description
of the great works in physics and
astronomy, and although Hawking
is picky about the few that get a
mention, the book does fulfil its task.
The book is beautiful and the colour
illustrations really make it special.
Not only are we given old paintings,
but computer-simulated depictions,
photographs and diagrams.
The book is an open invitation to
a complex and often impenetrable
subject without any hint of conde-
scension. There is enough technical
detail for those who want to get
to grips with specific theories, but
also enough biographical and unde-
manding narrative to charm any
non-scientist.

“So why is the cinema full of 50 to 60-
year-olds?” This was the first ques-
tion I asked myself as I sat down to
watch Finding Neverland. “Where
should I put the popcorn?” was the
second question. For the purposes
of this review, the first question is
more important than the second or
even the third, which I do not actu-
ally remember.
The answer to my first question
is that this is a film about the life of
JM Barrie (played by Johnny Depp),
author and playwright, who wrote
the classic children’s story Peter
Pan. In 1953, Walt Disney turned the
play into a feature length cartoon
which you may have come across.
However, Peter Pan made an indel-
ible impression on the minds of
today’s older generations, which
explains the slightly skewed demo-
graphic at my screening.
Finding Neverland is about
Barrie’s relationship with the
widow Sylvia Llewelynn Davis (Kate
Winslet) and her four young children.
The film tells the story of Barrie
befriending the family and drawing
inspiration from the Davis children
to create the world of Neverland and
write his play Peter Pan. Inevitably,
conflicts emerge as Barrie becomes
more detached from his life at home
with his wife, and grows closer to
the Llewellyn Davis family and to
Peter Pan.
The film deals with themes such
as creativity, childhood, belief and
family in an overly saccharine and
almost sanctimonious way. I found
myself worrying at times at how
unashamedly clichéd the scriptwrit-
ing was – not surprising considering
that this was David Magee’s first
screenplay. Suffice to say that the
plot was predictable and the charac-
ters were about as interesting as the
Sherfield Building. What is clearly
a highly ambitious and worthwhile
idea for a film has been wrecked by
a novice screenwriter with a first-
class honours degree in crass sen-
timentality.
Then there was the acting. The
likes of Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet,
and Julie Christie were a bit like
Tiger Woods at the 2000 US Open
at Pebble Beach: way under par.
Having recently seen Winslet in The
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind, audiences will be aware of the
talent which is so obviously absent
from her performance here. We
know they can all do better.
The film partially redeems itself
thanks to the child actors Nick Roud,
Joe Prospero, Freddie Highmore
and Luke Spill. They carry the
movie, giving by far the strongest
and most intense performances.
In fact, Depp was so impressed by
Highmore’s performance that he
convinced Tim Burton to cast him
as Charlie Bucket in next year’s
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
So if you are looking for an unpre-
dictable thriller starring Wesley
Snipes as an alien space-cop stuck in
a parallel universe where mankind
has been enslaved by giant radioac-
tive slugs... then you will have to
wait till 2005. Finding Neverland
is certainly an ambitious film with
some important messages, which
can easily be lost in an age when
studios are churning out films like
Alien vs. Predator. Unfortunately it
is also loaded with some nth degree
sentimentality that will inevitably
alienate students and sceptical film
reviewers alike.
