Wye Women’s 1st 17
GKT Women’s 1st 0
By Suzanne Horn
After a disappointing result
last week, we renewed our
spirits with a blazing perform-
ance from the entire team.
The score reflects the out-
standing dominance Wye
displayed throughout the
match, especially within the
first half. Some sterling runs
and tackles by the backs con-
tributed greatly to the overall
outcome of the game, while
the forwards were solid in the
scrums and line outs. There
was amazing effort by all who
played, resulting in the best
match of the season so far.
Our superstar winger, Lil,
won woman of the match for
her blinding tackles, knocking
any GKT girl for six. Cat, the
hooker, kept the scrum tight
against some controversial
put-ins by the opposing team.
Her powerful tackles man-
aged to hospitalise one of the
opponents, causing a broken
leg. Beware, this hooker is a
true hardcore Wye girl!
The sole fresher, Nat, put up
a brave performance, lasting
the full 70 minutes, despite
the ferocious intensity of the
match.
With possession on our side
for most of the first half, two
tries were well-deserved.
One was a dashing run by the
scrum half from the 10m line.
We went into the second half
with confidence and eventu-
ally gained another try from
an amazing piece of play by
the pack, the hooker touching
the down on the try line with a
special above the head move.
Andrea converted the last
try, to finish the game with a
convincing win. Em was also
particularly fantastic with her
tackling skills, which kept our
defence solid throughout.
This week, our team played
superb rugby, and we hope
that the standard of play can
be repeated for next week’s
away match against the
Virgins. Let’s see how many
bones we can break this time!
Thanks must go to all our sup-
porters, our coach, the touch
judges, the referee and the
William Harvey ambulance
crew. See you again next year
GKT!

Threes run riot as
UCL are destroyed
Sponsored by
Imperial Men’s 3rd 49
UCL Men’s 3rd 0
By Dan Lindsley
The second run out for
the Threes this season was
against the old enemy, UCL.
Previous encounters with
UCL had seen ringers drafted
in from the teams above, but
with every team playing this
Wednesday Imperial were
determined to make their
strengthened squad count.
Things boded well for
Imperial, with the opposition
turning up late and barely
fielding a full team. From the
kick off it was pretty evident
the way things were going
to go. Strong scrummaging
from the Imperial pack gave
quality ball to the backs and
great rucking left us with all
the possession and territory.
It soon told with tries pour-
ing in from all areas, with
even our heavyweight prop
Joe Sanders deciding that
his surname was Rokocoko,
spinning through the tackles
before waddling over for a
try.
Great support play from
man of the match Dave Collis
led to a stunning backs try
from the restart as well
providing others with the
opportunity to score. Matt
Banger once again had an
outstanding game, running in
two tries in the first half, and
fresher Gonz impressed from
full back with strong running
and a great try. There was a
great debut too for Marcos,
the Spanish number eight,
who worked tirelessly across
the entire park.
With the full compliment of
subs used at half time, things
started in a similar fashion to
the first half. Strong running
from Andy Wright and a great
debut try for lock Ben started
things rolling. At this point the
UCL lads started to drop like
flies, leading to a downturn
in our performance as com-
placency set in. Eventually,
with a UCL front row suf-
fering a suspected broken
neck caused by the substan-
tial frame of Joe Sanders, the
match was wrapped up.
Two games over this season
for the Threes with nearly
seventy points scored and
none conceded, how could
things improve? They did so
in style as the Threes humili-
ated the cock-sure Imperial
First XV in a close game of
ring tone challenge on the
bus home, winning 18-17
despite the cheating of Firsts
captain Hixxy.

UCL Beginners’
Tournament
It was yet another overcast
day in Hyde Park when
Imperial College Ultimate
Team (the Disc Doctors) gath-
ered for the UCL outdoors
beginners’ tournament.
After a quick chuck around
and warm up, the Disc
Doctors (DD) got ready for
their first match against fel-
low London team Brunel
(also known as STD1). DD
had a fantastic turnout of
over 15 beginners and five
experienced players, enough
for two 7-a-side teams.
For beginners’ tourna-
ments, teams are allowed five
beginners (less than three
months’ playing experience)
and two experienced players
on the pitch at any one time.
Experienced players are
always identifiable by hats or
funny items of clothing. The
best one this year was a tiger
suit!
STD1 9
Disc Doctors 0
The first game of the day, and
the pace was quite slow. DD
got right to business, mak-
ing a number of good, safe
passes. Well-placed cuts kept
the game flowing, but after
some impressive offence by
STD1, they managed to score
the first point of the match.
Brunel swiftly got into
rhythm and scored three con-
secutive points. Disc Doctors’
defence was quickly broken,
though not through lack of
effort. They responded well
by marking tighter and slow-
ing down the STD point-scor-
ing rampage. After a further
five points, the final score was
unfortunate, but all part of
the Ultimate learning curve.
One important part of
Ultimate Frisbee is the call.
The two teams gather round
at the end of the match and
the captains say a few words.
Then both teams pick a ‘call’
to do or play. Calls vary from
‘disc fencing’ to cycling on
mini-bikes, or even drinking
beer! After the call, the teams
walk around in a circle giving
high fives to the other team
who are walking round in the
opposite direction. This is a
good example of the spirit of
Ultimate.
Purple Haze 3
Disc Doctors 1
After a short break of prac-
tising throws, DD faced the
Loughborough team, Purple
Haze. The Haze team have
a good reputation and track
record for both their begin-
ners and experienced teams,
so the match was expected to
be a challenge.
Motivated from the previ-
ous game, DD went on the
offensive, moving towards the
Purple Haze endzone. Haze
held DD at bay and in a twist
of fate broke free to score
the first point. Purple Haze
pushed hard, making fast end-
zone cuts, but unfortunately
missing the completions.
Disc Doctors intercepted and
Magic (Chris R) threw a long
pass to Stas, who sent the
disc on to Alvin to score DD’s
first point.
Purple Haze changed their
tactics, making cuts to the
back of the DD endzone, but
a great DD defence stopped
themfromscoring.Eventually
they scored two more points
and with less than a minute
left, an all-beginners team
went on the play out the dying
seconds. This was a good per-
formance by DD against well
drilled Loughborough begin-
ners.
Disc Doctors 5
ABH 3
Disc Doctors’ third match was
against an all-women’s team,
made up mainly of members
of ABH (Actual Bodily Harm)
and a few female Thundering
Herd beginners.
ABH showed what they
were made of, putting up a
good hard fight. The teams
were quite evenly matched
at the start, with fantastic
defence and offence. ABH
went two points up thanks to
some solid handling and very
few errors, but DD began
regaining control with some
good interceptions and came
back to score. Towards the
end of the match, the Disc
Doctors were fighting back
and scoring points.
This match brought DD’s
first win, and great perform-
ances from both teams. ABH
played a well-structured
game, despite the very muddy
pitch and rain. Hey, Ultimate
is all-weather!
LSE 4
Disc Doctors 2
Having beaten ABH, DD
went on to play fellow London
College LSE. Hats off to LSE,
who last year didn’t have an
ultimate club and had turned
up this year with a full team of
beginners.
Disc Doctors began expe-
riencing a little bit of déjà vu,
finding themselves two points
down once again. LSE then
had the upper hand through-
out the match. After three
hard games, making mistakes
was inevitable, but the com-
mitment was still there with
DD players admirably laying
out for hard-to-reach discs.
They managed to score two
points, but it wasn’t enough
to win. The game ended 4-2 to
LSE, a wonderful start to the
season for their new team.
Having played four games
of competitive Ultimate, the
Disc Doctors beginners had
learnt a heck of a lot more
about game situations and
the spirit of the game. All the
players had improved drasti-
cally from the first to the last
match, and thanks go out to
all the experienced players
that came to play alongside
and support the new guys.
The muddy shirts and
smiling faces showed that
the whole team had had a
great time. Even the 9-
0 defeat didn’t look so bad,
as STD1 went on to win the
tournament! If you are inter-
