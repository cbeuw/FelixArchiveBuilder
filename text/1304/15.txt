My London felix@ic.ac.uk
My... pubs
“I like pubs where there’s a chance for a bit of banter without having to shout over music,
although a bit of music is essential. I often go to the Union Bar and would recommend the happy
hour at the Polo Bar for a change. Many other good places seem to be a blur but the home brew
at the Fitzroy Arms, just off Tottenham Court Road, sticks in the mind.”
My... clubs
“Pacha is definitely my favourite, but I also really enjoyed seeing the Cuba Brothers at
Ministry.”
My... restaurants
“Paper Tiger, of course! Actually the nicest meal I’ve had in London was at Isola. Manjaro on
Holloway Road serves some tasty West African food and there’s a pub and club downstairs
too.”
My... favourite day out
“It all depends on who you do it with, but the best day out I’ve had recently was when I went to
the last day of the Thames River Festival. We drank cloudy cider all day then finished off with a
bottle of champagne on the beach at Bankside while the fireworks went off.”
My... alternative
“Notting Hill Arts Club is friendly place with really clever decoration inside. They have a deep
house night called Underdog every second Sunday from 5pm until late, and entry is free before
6pm. They also have South American nights where they start with a bit of live salsa and carry
on to some drum and bass. My favourite thing about the venue though is the range of drinks and
the free snacks. There’s no draft beer but all the spirits, wines and bottled beers are excellent
and come from unusual places like Lapland. Beware that it’s not cheap, and if you think you can
drink a load of absinthe and work hard at College the next day then you are wrong.”
