DJ Mag is one of the most respect-
ed publications on the dance music
scene, being read all around the
world and with contributions from
some of the industry’s heavyweights.
Every year, it holds an open poll of
the general public to rank the top
100 DJs of the year, and bestow
upon some lucky jock the crown of
Number One DJ In The World. This
vote is really quite significant and
provides an interesting profile of
the current state of the world dance
scene and the tastes of the world’s
clubbers.
DJs are generally not popular
because of the way they look, their
personality, or whether they’re
in a ‘slutty celebs’ feature in this
month’s Heat magazine. No, the DJ
world is relatively – and refresh-
ingly – free from all the rubbish we
get shoved in our faces in today’s
personality-centred world. A DJ
will be popular or not, based on
the strength of their performances:
style, track selection and technical
ability all play equal parts, and to
a certain extent so does showman-
ship, but what’s definite is that it’s
only these things that really make a
difference: I don’t know what half of
my favourite DJs look like, their real
names, marital status etc, because
it really doesn’t matter! Suffice to
say, then, that the results of this
vote can be taken as a pretty good
measure of who’s hot and who’s not
in terms of DJs.
Last Thursday was the Top 100
DJs announcement party, a night
really not to be missed. Not only
would they be telling us who the win-
ner was, the party would also fea-
ture sets from dozens of the world’s
best. Add to that free entry before
10pm or a £5 donation to UNICEF
after, and you need a pretty good
reason not to go. And no, lectures on
Friday don’t count.
So off we went, to start what was
to be a heavy weekend of three
nights out in a row, under the arch-
es beneath London Bridge station.
Being a school night, there wasn’t a
massive queue so we got inside in a
few minutes and found the place to
be pumping already. Tonight three
of the massive arches were in use.
One was host to drum and bass and
breakbeat, one run by house label
Defected, and the biggest, back arch
being the ‘main room’.
Now unfortunately there were no
set lists to be seen, so we followed
our ears to where the music was
best and ended up in the Defected
arch. I really can’t comment on who
was playing where or at what time,
but in this arch there was a right old
party going on. Sexy, sunny house
music filled the air – notably Praise
Cats’ Shine on Me, one of my tunes
of the year – and people were get-
ting down everywhere. The main
room was, as you would expect,
pretty packed, and rocking all night
to the likes of James Zabelia and
Armin van Buuren. The drum and
bass arch seemed to be rolling from
the outside, though when we took a
look near the end of the night, the
music had changed down a gear to
breakbeat, and it seemed that the
room had emptied a bit.
Apparently at midnight they
announced the results, but we totally
missed that, and I only found out the
next day that the winner, and World
Number One DJ 2004 is Tiësto, for
the third time in a row!
CLUB REVIEWS
Take a five minute walk out the back
of Kings Cross Station, and you’ll
find a little hotspot for nightlife.
Within feet of each other are The
Cross, The Key and Canvas. The
area they’re in is an industrial area
by the canal, so it’s all warehouse-
type buildings. I remember my first
experience of clubbing in London
was here, at The Key, and how stuck
I was with the atmosphere of this
area.
TonightIhadgonedownformyfirst
visit to The Cross, for Renaissance,
tonight with special guest Hernan
Cattaneo. Hailing from Argentina,
his is probably not a name you’re
familiar with. It’s one you’re going
to hear a lot more about, though
– he’s number six in the top 100
chart, and has been going from
strength, including recently mixing
a Renaissance Masters CD.
On arrival, The Cross looks a little
out of place. In amongst the old ware-
houses and factory buildings, it’s
nicely decorated from the outside,
and makes you wonder what’s going
on inside to warrant big queues. At
this point I feel I must mention the
door policy, since The Cross is one of
the few serious nightclubs in London
to enforce a dress code. I’ve found it
hard to pin down exactly what this
is, and have heard variously that it’s
‘smart club-wear’, ‘no jeans or train-
ers’ and ‘jeans and trainers OK’.
With this in mind, I had suitable
attired myself with no denim, and
shoes that were definitely not train-
ers, and advised my companion for
the evening similarly. Unfortunately
it was not enough, and as we got to
the head of the queue he was told he
wouldn’t get in, as he looked too cas-
ual. In the end my friend went home,
and I queued again for another try.
I understand the reasons behind
the dress code, and am willing to go
along with it, but I have say it spoilt
my night, and I think it’s a shame.
This had been the main reason I’d
been apprehensive about the place,
and it may be a reason not to go
back. One way or another, if you’re
planning on visiting The Cross, I’d
make sure you think about what
you’re wearing first.
Issues aside, I got in eventually,
albeit alone, and was ready to party.
The Cross is made up of three arch-
es of music, with a bar/lounge in
between each. The last arch from
the entrance is the main one, with
the DJ at one end, and the floor ris-
ing toward the back, where there’s
an exit to the neatest part of the
whole place, the outdoor terrace.
This is effectively an extra chill out
area, nicely decorated with seating
and space to dance just outside the
main arch, and it’s a great place to
let some of the sweat evaporate and
make some new friends.
Having had a good nose around
to check the place out, it was time
to get lost in the music. With the
second arch providing more funky
house, the main arch was home to
the progressive beats provided by
Desyn Masiello and Pete Goodwing.
The main attraction, though,
was Hernan Cattaneo. At 1am he
appeared behind the decks and
started his epic journey through
music. This kind of house is all
about a vibe, constant and tight.
The music takes hold of you and,
provided the DJ has what it takes,
won’t put you down until the end
of the night. Technically, Cattaneo’s
mixing was almost flawless – his
worst slip-up was at one point let-
ting the music get down to a bare
beat before the next track came in
properly. Aside from that, his set
was enveloping, and the rammed
main arch went right off. The Cross
isn’t a huge place, and tonight it was
definitely approaching capacity. This
wasn’t a huge problem, though, as
the place is so well air conditioned.
Huge vents blow cooling air into the
crowds throughout the arches, so
there’s no problem keeping yourself
at a moderate temperature whilst
stomping like a nutcase.
The crowd is stylish, as you’d
expect when there’s a dress code in
force. As a place to meet potential
partners, The Cross scores pretty
highly – from my point of view there
were plenty of cute women around,
and they were particularly forward,
if you know what I mean.
All in all, I found The Cross to be
a fantastic club with a great atmos-
phere and superb music. I can’t get
away from the fact that my night
was spoiled when my friend was
turned away, though, so beware.

The End is one of my favourite late
night hang outs in London, as you
may have noticed if you’re used to
perusing these pages. The attitude,
style and quality of the place and
the people that go there mean that,
in my opinion, this is the best base-
ment in London to be spending the
small hours in.
Givenallthat,andthefactitwasmy
birthday, you won’t be surprised to
hear that I was there last Friday. The
night was Harlem Nights, another of
The End’s great monthly occasions,
and our host for the evening was the
venerable Steve Lawler. Master of
his chosen discipline, Lawler plays
dirty, progressive house.
On arrival, the queue was already
stretching around the corner. This
was a busy night, and with good rea-
son. The quality of the music on offer
and the system they play it over are
enough to draw people, so when a
big name like Lawler comes to town,
you know it’s going to fill up. Tonight
the lounge was a separate area, with
Lawler in charge of the main room.
The music in the lounge was funkier
house, so we made for the floor and
only left a couple of times the whole
night.
Normally there’s no hassle with
heat at The End, as their air con-
ditioning is good enough to keep
you cool. Tonight it seemed that the
place might be more rammed than
usual, as I couldn’t stop sweating.
Not just clammy skin, but great drips
of the stuff rolling down my face. To
be fair though, the place really was
full, with even the corners of the
dancefloor filled out with revellers.
Leaving the party briefly for a
break in the lounge, which by this
point was very cool and relatively
empty, we found some nice hip-
hop beats to lounge to for a while.
Apparently the majority of the crowd
was in the main room, and I can’t
blame them. Lawler was firing on
all cylinders tonight, and the crowd
egged him on with plenty of encour-
agement. Overall this was another
top night out courtesy of The End,
the only downer being that it fin-
ished at five.

Well it seems that trance is still on
top. A look at the top ten from DJ
Mag’s Top 100 poll shows no change
in the top four, with the top three
being the world’s trance heavy-
weights. Tiësto holds the crown
for a third year in a row, which is
hardly surprising considering this
man played at the opening ceremo-
ny of the Olympic Games!
