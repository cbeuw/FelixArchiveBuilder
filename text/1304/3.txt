“I suppose hobbits need some
description nowadays, since
they have become rare and
shy of the Big People, as they
call us. They are (or were) a
little people, about half our
height... They... wear no shoes,
because their feet grow natu-
rally leathery soles and thick
warm brown hair like the
stuff on their heads (which
is curly); have long clever
brown fingers, good-natured
faces, and laugh deep fruity
laughs (especially after din-
ner, which they have twice
a day when they can get it).
Now you know enough to go
on with.” – JRR Tolkien, The
Hobbit (1937), p16.
Were he alive today, the novel-
ist and anthropologist Tolkien
would have been as amazed as
the scientific community when
the 28 October 2004 issue of
Nature revealed the discovery
of a new human fossil whose
description was surprisingly
similar to the hobbits: they
were a little people, about half
our height.
But this is really one of
those rare cases when fic-
tion turned fact, as a team
of Australian and Indonesian
researchers, led by Peter
Brown and Mike Morwood
of the University of New
England, New South Wales,
and Thomas Sutikna and RP
Soejono of the Indonesian
Centre of Archaeology, intro-
duced Homo floresiensis to
the world. The discovery was
so unpredicted that Nature
even had to put a ‘This is
not a hoax’ sign on the news
pages, lest somebody thought
it was some kind of joke.
The remains of these little
people, that had actually been
called ‘hobbits’ by some of
their discoverers, show that
they were only 1m tall in life,
and their brain size was only
about a third of ours. They
were unearthed at the Liang
Bua cave on the eastern
Indonesian island of Flores.
The type specimen, LB1, is
a fairly complete skeleton of
an adult female, comprising
of a skull, a leg bone, a part
of the pelvis, and some limb
bones. Fragmentary remains
of seven other individuals of
the same type were also found,
which dismissed the probabil-
ity of LB1 being a freak indi-
vidual. Dating methods gave
an age of 38,000 to 18,000 years
for them. The researchers
also found bones of Komodo
dragons, now-extinct dwarf
elephants, and also stone tools
in the same site, which gave
an insight of how these people
might have lived.
“This find really does rewrite
our knowledge of evolution,”
said Chris Stringer, head of
human origins at the Natural
History Museum, as quoted
by news@nature.com. And
rewrite it, it will. The discov-
ery of Homo floresiensis has
opened the door for a host of
new possibilities and interest-
ing questions for the study of
human origins. For starters,
‘the hobbits’ might demon-
strate that the human lineage
was affected by the same pres-
sures that dictated the evolu-
tion of other creatures.
Flores is situated near the
eastern end of the Lesser
Sunda Islands, a chain of
islands stretching from Bali in
the west to Timor in the east.
During glacial times, the west-
ern part of Indonesia was con-
nected to the Asian land mass,
while the eastern part was
connected to Australia. But the
Lesser Sunda Islands (exclud-
ing Bali) were never attached
to any major land mass. Homo
erectus, known also as Java
Man, lived on Java, west of
Lesser Sunda Islands from
about one million to as late as
40,000 years ago. Earlier exca-
vations in Flores from geologi-
cally older sites (dated 840,000
years) discovered crude stone
tools which were then associ-
ated with Homo erectus, and it
was speculated whether Homo
erectus had the ability to make
boats to cross the seas. Since
Homo floresiensis specimens
show more skeletal and den-
tal similarities to Homo erec-
tus fossils than to modern
humans and Australopithecus,
the discoverers propose that
floresiensis might have origi-
nated from Javanese Homo
erectus.
But why were they so small?
At 1m tall, Homo floresiensis
were diminutive compared
to their taller cousins Homo
erectus, Neanderthal Man,
and we Homo sapiens could
reach the height of 2m. The
explanation might be due to
their island home. Islands do
strange things to the evolution
of the creatures that colonize
them, due to lack of preda-
tors, lack of competition, and
inadequate resources. Small
animals grow large: exam-
ples include lizards (Komodo
dragon), tortoises (Galapagos
tortoise), and even pigeons
(the dodo). On the other hand,
large mammals shrink. To cite
a well-known case, until 4000
yearsagotherewereadwarfed
species of woolly mammoths
living in Wrangel Island off
Siberia. For large mammals,
an island’s limited resources
would have favoured smaller
animals which could subsist
on less food, and natural selec-
tion over generations would
have resulted in a reduction
in body size. Also, the environ-
ment of Flores was (and still
is) drier and less productive
than other Indonesian islands,
and scientists had long known
about the existence of pony-
sized ancient elephants of the
genus Stegodon throughout
the Lesser Sunda Islands.
Normal-sized Stegodon lived
on Java and Sumatra at the
same time. There is a strong
case for insular dwarfism. But
no such case had been found
for humans, before the dis-
covery of Homo floresiensis.
They are now thought to be
the result of the same dwarf-
ing evolutionary process as
happened to the elephants on
the islands.
Our own species, modern
Homo sapiens, were thought
to have arisen from erectus-
like ancestors in Africa 150,000
years ago, and then spread
throughout the world. Modern
sapiens might have reached
Flores during the existence of
Homo floresiensis. This could
explain the presence of stone
tools. But at present there
is no evidence that they did
reach Flores at that time, and
floresiensis could have been
the toolmakers. And here we
haveanotherinterestingpossi-
bility, because floresiensis had
the brain size of a chimpan-
zee! This might indicate that in
terms of brain evolution, size is
not everything. This is the sec-
ond major impact brought by
Homo floresiensis. The little
guys might be smart enough
to make stone spearheads to
hunt pygmy elephants for din-
ner.
Another prospect brought
by Homo floresiensis is the
return of a major palaeoan-
thropological attention to
Indonesia. History recorded
that Homo erectus (Java
Man), the first fossil that sci-
ence acknowledged to be a
possible human ancestor,
was found in Java, Indonesia
by Eugene Dubois in 1891.
Indonesia was later brushed
to the sidelines as Africa
yielded more interesting fos-
sil humans: Australopithecus,
Homo habilis, Turkana Boy.
Now the discovery of the hob-
bits has drawn the human
origins researchers’ interest
back to Indonesia. It has been
reported that the Australian-
Indonesian team that discov-
ered floresiensis plan to do
more excavations on neigh-
bouring islands. Look forward
to more astonishing palae-
oanthropological finds from
Indonesia. In the meantime,
there are also plans to extract
DNA from floresiensis bones.
The most important impli-
cation Homo floresiensis
brought us might be its chal-
lenge to some of our conven-
tional views. This comes in two
parts. First, for a long time,
human evolution is portrayed
as a linear march to progress,
from lowly knuckle-walking
ape to proud human stand-
ing tall. Until several decades
ago, the discoveries seemed
to strengthen that view.
Palaeoanthropologists saw
a trend of increasing stature
and brain size in time. The
outline of human evolution
was beginning to be predict-
able. But nobody predicted
that human evolution could
produce extreme forms like
floresiensis: a dwarfed form of
its probable direct ancestors.
Sure, there were cases like
that in other lineages, such
as horses, and elephants, but
among humans? No, palaeon-
tologist had ever speculated
that it could happen.
Of course, it should not
have been too much of a sur-
prise. After all, evolution is a
seemingly undirected proc-
ess with no long-term goal
to achieve. But in the case
of humans, somehow, we
never got round the issue of
progress. Somehow we still
want human evolution to be
directed at producing only us,
the single dominant species
on Earth today. As Henry Gee
said in his commentary of the
find for news@nature.com,
the uniqueness of humans had
become ingrained in our phi-
losophy, ethics, religion, and
even our science. And this is
the second part: the challenge
to our notion of uniqueness.
There are only one human
species on Earth now, but it
had not been always so. There
were times when our ances-
tors lived alongside other
human species. They lived
side by side Neanderthals in
Europe and Middle East, and
the last populations of Homo
erectus in Java. They might
also have encountered the
hobbits, Homo floresiensis, as
they spread across the world.
Further back, one or two mil-
lion years ago, there were
ass many as four species of
ancient humans living togeth-
er in Africa. We were not alone.
And I wonder how our ances-
tors treat the other human
species. Did they ignore each
other? Did they treat them as
friends? Enemies? Or even as
just another animal to hunt?
We are left to speculate the
possibilities.
In time, we will address the
challenges Homo floresiensis
brought. But for now, let us
just celebrate the introduc-
tion of this new and extraor-
dinary member of our family,
Flores Man, the ‘hobbit’, Homo
floresiensis. We did not get
to meet them in life, but we
could still imagine the world
they lived in, a world almost
unreal. They were a little
people, they lived in the pres-
ence of (Komodo) dragons,
and they probably hunt dwarf
elephants.
They were the real hobbits.
