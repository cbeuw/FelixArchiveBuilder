Lured in by £1 student tickets and
the promise of a complimentary
Cobra beer post-performance, I
took myself off this Friday evening
to the Royal Festival Hall for my
first ever live orchestra experi-
ence.
Despite avid participation in a high
school ensemble, my knowledge and
understanding of the plethora of
classical composers is sadly fairly
minimal. I entered the auditorium
armed with little beyond the names
of the three composers behind the
night’s pieces and a vague sense of
excitement for this excursion into
the unknown.
Given the above preamble, I am
perhaps unqualified to ‘review’ the
evening’s performance in the strict-
est sense of the word, but would
nevertheless like to attempt to con-
vey my experience to you in a bid to
ensnare a few more specimens into
giving a classical concert a go.
It was to be a night of Russian
music by the composers Stravinsky,
Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov. I
entered the hall and took my seat
in the choir section and thus had
full view of both the players and
the main audience. The orchestra
promptly filed in and began tuning
their instruments in preparation
for the arrival of their conductor.
This duly occurred when a certain
Vassily Sinaisky, an aged and wiry
Russian sporting a mass of unruly
grey curls, took to the stage gracing
both the public and his orchestra
with a deep bow and cheeky grin.
Without delay, the company
launched into its first piece,
Stravinsky’s Scherzo Fantastique,
Opus 3. With no preconceived
notion of what to expect, I spent
the duration of this piece watching
in fascination as Sinaisky writhed
round the podium, swinging his
arms to and fro, baton in hand,
sending cryptic signals to his min-
ions to create what appeared to
my untrained eye and ear a vigor-
ous and triumphant performance.
Double bassists smacked their
strings to produce a rich and heavy
pulse, violins crescendoed to ear-
splitting effect, oboes squeezed in
their thin, fragile lament between
the more powerful reverberations
of the brass and a majestic, solitary
flute rose above them all to capti-
vate the entire hall and bring the
Scherzo to conclusion.
By this point I was thorough-
ly embroiled in my study of each
instrumentalist and their toils with
the music and watched with inter-
est as members of the orchestra
switched seats and re-jigged instru-
ments in preparation for the second
piece of the evening, Prokofiev’s
Concerto 3 in C for Piano and
Orchestra, Opus 26, a piece that
belonged to its solo pianist from
start to finish.
The charismatic Jean-Efflam
Bavouzet was quite clearly relish-
ing his every moment on stage and
did indeed deliver a polished and
moving performance. He conclud-
ed with great panache and was
applauded excitedly by the packed
auditorium. After several returns
to the stage, and much over-zealous
bowing and grinning, he sauntered
back to his piano and proceeded
to delight the audience with a five
minute solo delivered with perhaps
just an ounce too much self-indul-
gence.
Rimsky-Korsakov’s symphonic
suit Scheherazade, Opus 35, is com-
posed of four movements and based
on the Arabian Nights stories. The
music thus manages to envelope
the listener into its fairy-tale set-
ting and evokes a distinctly oriental
atmosphere. The piece alternates
between the signature of the hulk-
ing menace of a Sultan, repre-
sented through strident, confident
groupings of strings complemented
by a self-assured tuba and a pair
of bassoons, and his Scheherazade
rippling through this rumble on a
solo violin and graceful woodwind
accompaniment.
This lengthy suite was the show-
piece of the evening, delighting
players, audience and myself; I
remained enthralled from start to
finish. Armed with the programme
notes on what I should be looking out
for through the progression of each
movement, I felt better equipped to
appreciate the complexities of what
was unrolling before me. I proudly
recognized the “shivering strings”
signalling “danger and adventure”
in the second movement and could
appreciate the sound of the sea
through the “heaving” strings in
the first movement. By the end of
the fourth movement, as the Sultan
and Scheherazade are reconciled,
I too let out a deep sigh of relief
– the story and music had come to
a successful conclusion and I had
survived my first foray into the
classical world.
I had done much more than just
survive though. I had thoroughly
enjoyed the evening, full, as it was,
of novel excitement.
I compel you all to give such a
concert a go. From as little as one
pound you can take a break from
your scientific study, spend a cou-
ple of hours in the company of some
talented musicians and exit with
a peculiar sensation that, despite
the loss of that pound, your world
has become that little bit richer
from what you have just exposed
yourself to.

If you are already a fan of the
Russian composers, and wish to find
out more, I would suggest reading
Orlando Figes’ Natasha’s Dance. It
may seem a bit of a daunting read
at the onset, but stick with it and
you will be suitably rewarded by
this well written history of Russian
culture.

Prokofiev: Piano concerto 3 in C
Rimsky-Korsakov: Scheherazade
From Russia to the South Bank, with love
Lynsey McInnes more than survives an evening at the London Philharmonic,
serenaded by the glorious music of three Russian composers
So, what is this about? Any sugges-
tions from the audience? Readers
who were around last year will,
hopefully, remember the assorted
attempts that were made to get you
all involved in the Arts in London
by encouraging you to subscribe
to various student programmes.
As you can see above, we’ve
had some success with the
Philharmonic.
We are fully aware that orchestras
are not everyone’s cup of tea. So, this
week we bring you the Royal Court
Theatre’s student programme.
There are leaflets dotted about
the South Kensington Campus, but
should you not be able to get your
hands on one, here are the basics:
For the princely sum of £5 you
will receive: discounts on tickets;
free drinks at pre/post-perfomance
receptions, and for you frustrated
dramatists out there, invitations to
casting, play writing and directing
workshops.
I trust this has whetted the appe-
tites of some of you out there. The
Royal Court Theatre is on Sloane
Square, very easy to get to, and has
just recently been redeveloped. It
boasts a spacious bar and restau-
rant in the basement (very nice,
take my word for it), and the audito-
rium is more suited to the demands
of the modern theatre-goer.
The theatre focuses on bringing
new works to the public. These
include not only works by both
British and international play-
wrights, but also works by young
aspiring playwrights who have risen
through the theatre’s play writing
course. Definitely on the leading
edge of theatre.
Labelled “the most important
theatre in Europe” by the New York
Times, anyone interested in theatre
needs a very good excuse not to
make the most of the Hype offer.
Go to the theatre’s website www.
royalcourttheatre.com for more
information, or take yourself down
there and have a look around. It’s
about a 15 minute walk from South
Kensington.
What is all the Hype about? Since I’ve already got started...
Apologies to those of you who really
don’t like Russian composers; I’m
going to indulge and continue on the
theme.
I’ve always loved the Russian com-
posers, going back to the time when
I was going to be a ballerina, so it’s
really been a while. Their music is so
beautifully expressive, full of emotion
and a fabulous number of thoroughly
memorable melodies.
Most of you will be familiar at least
with some Tchaikovsky. Swan Lake
is quite possibly the world’s most
famous ballet, and there are snippets
of his score for Sleeping Beauty in
the soundtrack of the Disney classic
of the same name.
Apart from Tchaikovsky, there are
a great number of other Russian
composers whose music you will
have, no doubt, been exposed to.
Rimsky-Korsakov’s Flight of the
Bumblebee has been hijacked and
turned into a ring tone. Mussorgsky’s
NightonaBareMountainalsomakes
a Disney appearance in Fantasia,
and Rachmaninov is given a writing
credit on a Celine Dion song, though
I forget which one. Prokofiev’s Peter
and the Wolf is a timeless classic,
and Shostakovich’s Waltz from the
second Jazz Suite appears in Eyes
Wide Shut. I could go on...
I cannot recommend Natasha’s
Dance enough, and will leave
you with a reminder to check the
Philharmonic’s season and with
advance warning that the Royal
Ballet will be gracing us with
Stravinsky’s seminal The Rite of
Spring this spring.
