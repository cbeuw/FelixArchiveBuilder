Given that I’m writing this
before Tuesday, you can
understand that I’m not par-
ticularly keen to talk about
the American presidential
election and end up as wrong
as the Evening Standard
(with their famous ‘It’s Gore’
headline) was last time. The
election has been far and
away the biggest story of the
last week, and with Tony Blair
away signing the European
Constitution, domestic news
has been pretty slow. So what
have the papers been talking
about?
The Daily Mail was get-
ting pretty exercised, in a way
that only it can, about gam-
bling, even setting up a ‘Kill
the Bill’ petition on its web-
site. The Mail was not alone
– Guardian and Independent
columnists came out against
the bill to legalise super-casi-
nos as well – but Mail writers
are the only ones able to do it
with such vigour. Many news-
papers were dubious about
the government’s claims that
the new casinos would cre-
ate 80,000 new jobs without
a significant increase in the
numbers of gambling addicts,
but it is interesting that those
papers that usually shout
the loudest about interfering
‘nanny state’ legislation are
suddenly the ones asking the
government to protect us.
The Mail spoke about a poll
which showed Britons were
‘overwhelmingly’ against the
new bill; but for those of us
who read the poll results, this
was a surprising conclusion.
The Telegraph was more
even-handed, reporting that
59% of Britons believe ‘adults
should be treated as grown
ups and allowed to choose
their leisure pursuits’ and not
just that 70% thought there
would be an increase in gam-
bling addiction as a result of
the plans.
The Archbishop of
Canterbury also spoke out,
saying the casinos would lead
to a ‘downward spin’ in parts
of society. Some Labour back-
benchers, in particular Frank
Dobson, were against the bill
as well, arguing that it will
be a tax on the poor. Others
argue that, like the lottery,
it is not a tax on the rich or
the poor so much as on the
stupid.
The Gambling Bill was
read for the second time in
Parliament this week and
was passed, but only after
a large rebellion by Labour
backbenchers who were
only won over after conces-
sions from Tessa Jowell, the
Culture Secretary, including a
possible cap on the number of
super-casinos allowed nation-
wide. Expect further trouble
and many more concessions
on this Bill before it is settled
one way or the other.
The Sun had a good week
too, with the astonishing dis-
covery of ‘Victoria Barkham’
– a Labrador that, with the aid
of a wig, looks exactly like the
former Spice Girl. They also
found time to get outraged
on behalf of ‘our boys’ in Iraq,
with the news that they have
to buy their own kit due to the
stuff they are supplied with
being seriously faulty.
Which brings us nicely onto
the other big story of the
week – the news that Iraqi
civilian deaths are nearer
100,000 than the 10,000 previ-
ously spoken about. This was
picked up in a big way, as
it would be, by the anti-war
Independent, who reported
that half of the dead were
women and children. The
report estimating the number
of deaths was published in
The Lancet last week and
was studiously ignored by the
leaders on both sides of the
Atlantic.
The newspapers were
reduced to quoting Claire
Short on the issue. No mat-
ter how much sense she
may be making, she isn’t
exactly representative of the
Government on this particu-
lar subject.
We may, we hope, have some
action – or at the very least
some mindless platitudes
– on this after the American
election. Until then, it’s too
dangerous to mention.
New Bill to create nation of gamblers?
Reading the newspapers so you don’t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at some
of the week’s biggest national news stories

A total of around 530 stu-
dents attended last Friday’s
Freshers Ball, held jointly by
the City and Guilds College
Union and the Faculty of
Physical Sciences Students’
Union.
Dinner was enjoyed by
engineering students in the
Main Dining Hall and physi-
cal sciences students in
the Senior Common Room.
Entertainment on the
Queen’s Lawn included live
jazz, a casino, a bar and a
scalextric track.
Ticket sales for the ball were
initially slow, leading to fears
over its viability. Previous
large-scale balls have suf-
fered heavy losses. However,
in the week leading up to the
event, tickets for engineer-
ing students were completely
sold out, due in part to the
sterling work of Guilds offic-
ers in traditional dress.
After the ball, Martin Chong,
the Honorary Secretary of
the City and Guilds College
Union, who played a key
role in organising the event,
immediately made his feel-
ings known by resigning from
his position.

A straight flush... but is it legal? Columnists and politicians
are divided over the legalisation of super-casinos
