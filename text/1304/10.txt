Summer tour 2004
By Daniel Carrivick
This year’s Outdoor Club
summer tour was our most
successful tour ever (well
certainly since records
began), with participants,
most of whom were novices
to the Alpine mountaineer-
ing scene, accomplishing
seven challenging routes in
five days and reaching a high
point of 4016m.
Term had barely ended by
the time our fully laden mini-
bus left South Kensington
for a fortnight in the French
Alps. This year, the bus got
us to Dover without breaking
down, but there our journey
was delayed by rough seas.
Several hours later, ferry
services were resumed and
our long journey to the Ecrin
Massif continued.
On arrival, the weather
forecast looked settled for the
next few days, so wasting no
time we headed straight up
into the mountains. An early
(Alpine) start saw everyone
continue up on to the Glacier
Blanc as dawn broke, after an
overnight bivi at Refuge du
Glacier Blanc. From there,
one group ascended Pic du
Glacier d’Arsine (3364m) by
the north west ridge, and the
other climbed the south west
rocky flank of Pic de Neige
Cordier (3614m).
Base Camp was set up back
on the Glacier Blanc (3070m),
just down from the Refuge
des Ecrin and under the
south face of Pic de Neige
Cordier.
The following day, we
attempted our prime objec-
tive, the Barre des Ecrins,
and a 3am start was called
for to beat the weekend rush
of climbers attempting the
same route. Bleary-eyed,
with head torch beams van-
ishing into the darkness, we
made our way up the Glacier
Blanc soon to discover a line
of other groups already ahead
of us.
Alex made short work
of overtaking our fellow
Europeans – not easy on
uncompacted snow – and
by the time we reached the
foot of the mountain, just as
the sun was rising, we were
almost in pole position. From
here, steep snow slopes were
ascended, their gradient and
the lack of oxygen at altitude
reducing our pace to a slow
plod.
At the Breche Lory, a steep
pitch of ice led up to ridge,
slowing the groups ahead of
us down and causing a bottle
neck. Once up on the ridge
another difficulty, this time on
rock, formed another bottle-
neck delaying those waiting
to gain the west ridge of the
Barre des Ecrins. Given the
size of our group and the long
queue, we elected to summit
the Barre des Ecrins’ smaller
neighbour, Dome de Neige
des Ecrin (4016m).
The views from the top
were amazing, with the
Matterhorn, Mont Blanc and
Monte Rosa all visible on
the other side of the Alps.
But despite the clear skies
there was a chilly breeze, and
before long we were descend-
ing to keep warm.
Descending the steep ice
pitch was painfully slow,
crowded and dangerous,
especially as a gaping cre-
vasse loomed at its base. A
French climber from another
group slipped and fell onto
Naomi, but fortunately only
bruises were sustained before
the rope prevented them both
falling any further. The rest of
the descent was uneventful
and we made it back to base
camp around midday.
With feet battered and blis-
tered, some people spent the
next day resting, while the
remainder climbed Pic de
Neige Cordier (3614m), this
time by way of an exposed
scramble up the north ridge.
Having made good time, we
decided to try a second peak,
Roche Emile Pic (3586m). The
sun had been on the snow a
long time now, and the short
climb was exhausting as we
sunk into the soft white slush
up to our thighs. The descent
proved even more tricky with
the conditions making slips
inevitable and falls difficult
to protect against. Once back
at the col, we dropped down
onto a snow slope, inclined at
an easier angle, from where
we sat on survival bags and
slid the final 500m back into
base camp. That afternoon,
a small group climbed the
rocky south ridge of Pic du
Glacier Blanc (3527m).
With food supplies dwin-
dling, another early start
saw us reach the top of the
Roche Faurio (3730m) before
packing up base camp and
dropping over 2000 vertical
metres back to the valley
floor. Dan and JJ cycled back
to the campsite while eve-
ryone else got a lift in the
minibus. Unfortunately, hit-
ting a pothole at speed on
a descent while applying the
brakes sent Dan over his han-
dlebars, leaving part of his
knee spread over the tarmac.
Under strict doctor’s orders
to “rest the knee” and “not go
cycling for at least two days”,
Dan joined the rest of the
group rock climbing in the
valley (on one leg) and doing
Via Ferrata. The following few
days were spent in the club’s
inflatable canoes (or, as the
French call them, ‘hot dogs’)
descending the grade III rap-
ids of the Lower Durance and
canyoning down one of the
many icy melt water ravines,
carved deep into the side of
the valley.
Returning to the Refuge
du Glacier Blanc (2542m),
we climbed the Pointe des
Cineastes (3203m). JJ and
Bernard climbed a route
called Le Vieux Piton, before
meeting the rest of us at the
top for a south-north traverse
of the pinnacled ridge. With
drops of 1000ft on either side
and the valley floor visible
some 3000ft below that, the
exposure soon had stom-
achs churning. This was only
amplified by a massive rock
fall which sent reverbera-
tions across the valley and
columns of dust high into the
air. Thankful that we were
not in its path, we finished
the ridge by abseiling off to a
snow slope. Unprepared for
its steepness, those not wear-
ing mountaineering boots
were soon caught out and
sent skidding down the moun-
tain. Accelerating alarmingly
quickly, Dan hit bumps and
flew through the air before
the slope eased and the self-
arrest was effective in termi-
nating his slide. Numbed by
snow burn, and bloodied by a
lacerated finger, Dan joined
the others before returning
all the way back down the
valley.
The next day, thunder-
storms and torrential rain
like you’ve never seen before
caused rocks, some the size
of televisions, to plop 20-30m
into the river from overhang-
ing river cliffs. Feeling vulner-
able in our canoes, we sought
shelter on the opposite river
bank, taking care to distance
ourselves from all things
metal as the lightning flashed
overhead. Thankfully, within
half an hour the storm had
passed and we continued pad-
dling the unrelenting grade 4
rapids of the Upper Ubaye
Racecourse in the rain.
More canoeing followed on
our final day before return-
ing to the campsite for a
humungous barbeque washed
down with lots of French
wine and beer (essential to
help the long journey back to
London go quicker the next
day). A stop and search by a
dozen French customs offi-
cials ensured we missed our
ferry home too. They eventu-
ally let us continue after a lot
of gesturing and the repeti-
tion of French sentences that
made no sense whatsoever
confirmed their suspicions
that we were nothing more
than “crazy Englishmen”. We
made it through Calais with-
out any asylum seekers jump-
ing on board and reached
London just as a new day was
starting, left with the memo-
ries of an awesome few weeks
in the Alps.
