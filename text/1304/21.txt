After barely escaping certain death
in the tulgey wood in Through the
Looking Glass, Jabberwock made
a fleeting appearance in the short-
lived Dulwich Tribune, and now
comes whiffling and burbling into
Felix Coffee Break Land in order to
provoke and entertain you.
This week’s puzzle is quite
straightforward (I hope), with a few
harder words that should be easy
given their cryptic definitions.
As this is one of my first few
(printed) puzzles, I realise it may be
rather clumsy in places, so please
email any comments or criticisms
you may have. Jabberwock
