NASA sets date
for Atlantis shuttle
launch
NASA announced last Friday
that its new target for resum-
ing the space shuttle program
is May 2005. The previous
target of March has had to be
scrapped as a result of disrup-
tion to work caused by summer
hurricanes. All shuttle flights
were suspended after the 2003
Columbia disaster in which
seven astronauts were killed
when the shuttle exploded.
Dark streaks on
surface of Titan
Images from the Cassini
spacecraft reveal dark patch-
es on the surface of Saturn’s
biggest moon, which could
indicate the presence of liq-
uid hydrocarbons. While it is
necessary to compare these
with other readings, scientist
said Titan is certainly “geo-
logically alive.” There is also
evidence of atmospheric ac-
tivity, possibly winds, moving
material around.
Remains of
Hobbit-sized
human discovered
Scientists in Australia have
found a new species of hob-
bit-sized humans who lived
about 18,000 years ago. The
partial skeleton uncovered is
of a three foot tall female with
a chimpanzee-sized brain.
Astronomers on
lookout for
asteroid threat
A team from the Queen’s
University in Belfast is moni-
toring asteroids in space and
checking whether they are
on a collision course with our
planet. The important data will
be fed into an international
program for protecting the
Earth from future impact.
There are, currently, an aver-
ageof30-40Near-EarthObjects
(NEOs) found each month.
Study: tea can
improve memory
Results of laboratory tests by
a team from the University of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne suggest
that green and black tea could
help improve your memory.
Both kinds of tea inhibit the
activity of enzymes associat-
ed with Alzheimer’s disease,
while coffee has no signifi-
cant effect. Researchers are
now seeking funding for more
tests on green tea.
A DAY IN THE DIET OF A STUDENT

Kate Wighton, MSc Science Communication, describes her Commemoration day
8am Got up. No breakfast. Was up all last night getting my essay finished and was really rushed this morning. Also had
to entertain my parents who had come up for the ceremony. Had to get into College early to hand in my essay, collect my
gown and have my photo taken.
11am Sneaky banana, just before entering the Albert Hall for the start of the ceremony.
1.45pm Champagne reception on the Queen’s Lawn. I managed to get two glasses of champagne and five canapés with cream cheese and smoked
salmon.
3pm Lovely meal with parents in a Lebanese restaurant just off high Street Kensington. We had mezzo which consisted of lots of little dishes such as a pitta
bread and hummus, lamb kebabs, falafel, lentils, pastries containing spicy meat, fried chicken wings in lemon and butter, and fried potatoes with chilli and pep-
pers. I also had three more glasses of champagne and two glasses of red wine. This was all followed by mini pastries with mascarpone style cream.
10pm Absolutely stuffed after the meal, so nothing until late. Some lovely crusty fresh white bread with Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference apricot jam, and a
large cup of Earl grey tea.
Rosie Taylor, Felix Science Dietician says...
Student total calorific intake: 3500 calories
Recommended (female) calorific intake: 2000 calories
As this is a special day for Kate, one might expect a little overindulgence. The odd day of eating unhealthily like this is not a concern, as long as the diet is
more well-balanced on a day to day basis.
Both the canapés and the meal at the restaurant were laden with saturated fats, with most of the foods containing pastry. Add to this the eight units of
alcohol (five glasses of champagne, two glasses of wine), which contributed 1200 calories and far exceeded the recommended upper limits of two to three
units per day for women, and you’ve got the makings of a fairly horrendous diet. There is no sign of any fruits or vegetables, except for the banana, and a small
amount of peppers in the main meal, which doesn’t go far enough to meet the minimum five portions a day that is recommended.
Fancy a baby? This is a
thought that most of you are
either postponing to a later
date or, more likely, has bare-
ly crossed your mind. Not
surprisingly, nowadays an
increasing number of couples
understand the advantages
of deciding to have children
later on in life.
Reproductive science has
come a long way since the
first test tube baby, Louise
Brown, was born in Britain
on July 25, 1978. The event
was accompanied by furious
controversy over the ethics
and safety of the procedure.
Since Louise, IVF treatment
has continued to provide a
potential solution for the mil-
lions afflicted by infertility
and is the most commonly
used method of assistive
reproductive technology.
Quite alarmingly, however,
recent news has emerged
that babies conceived in the
lab are more likely to suffer
certain health problems such
as cancer, birth defects and
certain genetic disorders.
These newborn are twice
as likely to have a low birth
weight, which is a factor in
65% of infant deaths.
In the procedure of in-vitro
fertilization, female egg cells
(ova) are removed from the
ovaries and fertilised “in-
vitro” (Latin for “in glass”)
upon the addition of sperm, in
a fluid medium. The embryos
are then transferred back
to the uterus where normal
development takes place.
In some countries, multiple
embryos (up to six) are trans-
ferred in order to improve
the chance of at least one
successful pregnancy taking
place. As a result of this, the
rate of multiple IVF births
worldwidehasincreased,with
a twinning rate of 25% (com-
pared to 1.25% for the normal
population), a triplet rate of
2-3% and a quadruplet rate of
0.5% of total IVF pregnancies.
These multiple pregnancies
represent further risks both
to the test tube babies, which
are at a greater risk of com-
plications than single births,
and to the mothers, who are
placed under larger physical
strain.
One would imagine that the
simple solution would be not
to put so many fertilised eggs
in. According to experts gath-
ered at the ASRM (American
Society for Reproductive
Medicine) meeting in
Philadelphia on 21 October
this year, it may actually be
that simple. Studies now sug-
gest that adding more embry-
os does not boost the chances
of pregnancy – single trans-
fers are just as likely to result
in success.
Complicating the matter
further still, fresh news seems
to suggest that not only mul-
tiple births but also multiple
parents may be associated
with IVF.
Work from a group of
researchers led by Zhuang
Guanglun in Sun Yat-Sen
University of Medical Science
in China has led to the preg-
nancy of a woman with foe-
tuses which have three
genetic parents. This was
accomplished by the process
of nuclear transfer, by which
fertilised egg nuclei (pronu-
clei) are removed and placed
into ooctyes (immature
female eggs) that have had
their own nuclei removed.
The result is an oocyte which
may possess DNA from 3
different sources: nuclear
DNA from the original sperm
and egg and mitochondrial
DNA from the second, ‘emp-
tied’ oocyte. These oocytes
can then be induced to form
embryos.
The logic behind this
practice is to increase the
chance of the foetus having
healthy mitochondria, the
energy producing organelles
of the cell. In the US, up to
4000 children are born with
mitochondrial DNA defects
per year. Such defects are
linked to a variety of diseases
such as Parkinson’s, can-
cer, heart disease, diabetes
and Alzheimer’s, and may
lead to infertility. However,
the pregnancy generated by
this method was unsuccess-
ful and all the fertilised eggs
(or zygotes) implanted died.
Nonetheless, the research-
ers claim that this was due
to pregnancy complications
rather than to faults in the
fertility technique employed.
All this new research may
soundpredictablyanddisturb-
ingly like cloning. However,
this is not the case: despite
sharing the same procedure
of nuclear transfer, cloning
(in the way that the famous
Dolly the Sheep was created)
is markedly different for one
crucial reason: the pronuclei
transferred are derived from
adult cells and not embryonic
ones. This apparently sub-
tle difference is actually one
of the main complications in
cloning and is accountable
for the many problems asso-
ciated with animals gener-
ated by cloning.
The dispute regarding the
safety and morality of assist-
ed reproduction rages on.
Although advances in tech-
nology are allowing us ever
increasingly to overcome our
individual shortcomings in
this department, the contro-
versy will not be resolved any
time soon.

Current IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) treatment often results in multiple births. New
research shows that this need not be the case
Multiple pregnancies, now multiple parents
Since the first ‘test tube baby’ in 1978, IVF has been dogged with controversy.
