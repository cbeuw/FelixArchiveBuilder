People in general complain a lot.
Students complain more. Of course,
we students have meagre financial
support and are in need, and conse-
quently have every right in the world
to complain. Me included... I have
plenty of time to ruminate about
my miserable student life, full of
sacrifices made to be able to afford
a tiny bit of fun. Boring lectures and
long bus rides provide the optimum
atmosphere for this daily activity.
Until a thought strikes me. We are
as rich as kings (if not better off!)
Thought you misread that? You are
mistaken. I’ll tell you why, and you
will be amazed. Think about the
lives of most kings who once lived on
this planet (of course excluding the
Royal family). Most of them lived in
cold castles with none of the tech-
nology our lives are full of.
Just imagine that you wanted to
contact a friend. As a medieval king
(or queen in my case), you would
have two options: either go to see
him in person to say a few words, or
send a messenger to deliver a letter
to the person in question, both of
which are not very efficient ways.
On the other hand, 20th century
students have access to telecommu-
nications technology, and even the
most outdated mobile phone avail-
able on the market would serve the
purpose of making a three minute
call to your friend, in the warmth
and comfort of your home, without
having to brave the weather or hav-
ing to wait ages for your messenger
to come back for an answer. And the
option of sending text messages and
emails is still there if the voice of the
person in question is unbearable...
Student life involves living in halls
with minuscule rooms or dodgy flats
with tatty furniture, and it would be
almost offensive to try to compare
these to the space and furnishing
of palaces. But even us students
have more riches than the rich-
est people at the time in terms of
technology and services. Tired of
cooking? You can treat yourselves,
even on a student budget from time
to time, by ordering a pizza. Give
those customer-friendly people a
ring, promise them a sum of money
and they’ll be at your modest abode
in less than no time with a steam-
ing hot dinner! Need some enter-
tainment? One can just go to the
cinema nearby and relax, or tel-
ephone a friend and go to the pub to
chill. More examples? Think fridge,
microwave, computers, radio, and
central heating, which keeps your
room at the desired temperature
thanks to that simple device called a
thermostat, without having to bear
a superheated room when the fire
in the chimney is lit or icy cold when
it is not. I’m sure you can come up
with more.
Let’s move to another more
interesting topic, which is that of
travel. Most of us here don’t live
near College, let alone in London.
TravellinginLondonisniceandeasy.
But what if I lived, say in Manchester,
or Scotland? Nowadays, we can just
jump on a train and visit our folks.
Centuries back, it would have taken
days to make such a journey in a
carriage. And I doubt kings could do
the same as in Lord of the Rings and
travel from the north to the south of
the UK on horseback non-stop. And
what about Australians? By the time
they reached home by sea, summer
would be over and term would have
restarted!
My laptop and internet connec-
tion are other comforts that none of
these kings could have at the time.
I can just type this article, email it
and share my ideas... all this, lying
down in bed and without having to
travel, feeling warm and contented.
Of course, you might not agree with
me: kings did not have to bear the
torture of never-ending lectures, or
cook for themselves, or slave away
to get some more pocket money, but
it’s just a crazy idea...
Just a crazy thought...
Zaina Nobeebux argues that many students today are far better off than they might think
Transport issues affect everyone
who studies or works at Imperial.
Many of you commute in by tube,
rail, bus or bike every day; others
use them at some point to go shop-
ping or go out with your mates. So
have you ever wondered why things
often don’t seem to work the way
you’d like?
Imagine this: you’re coming into
Imperial in the morning by train,
and an announcement is made that
your train has been delayed because
of “leaves on the line”. Sound famil-
iar? The media seize on this every
autumn, but the reality is that leaves
on the line are as dangerous as
black ice on a road. When leaves
fall onto the track, the weight of a
135 tonne train compresses them
into a graphite-like coating which
acts like a lubricant on the track.
The next train that comes along
just slides along the track when it
brakes, which can lead to it over-
shooting red signals or station plat-
forms. Therefore train drivers drive
more slowly when there are leaves
on the line, leading to delays, but
safer journeys.
So, you’ve eventually arrived at
your terminus and you need to catch
the Circle Line to South Kensington.
Unfortunately there are none indi-
cated on the departure board, and
after waiting for ten minutes you
give up and catch a different line.
What is it about the Circle Line that
makes it, frankly, crap?
Well, the poor old Circle has to
cross six flat junctions on its repeti-
tive trek around London. A flat junc-
tion is where trains on one track
have to cross another track “on the
flat” – meaning that whilst a train
is crossing that junction, any other
trains have to wait for it to fin-
ish. If you’ve ever got to a cross-
roads just as the lights go green for
cars and you have to wait at every
arm you cross, you’ll understand
how it can make you late (espe-
cially when you’re dashing into lec-
tures from Evelyn Gardens). And
because Circle trains are constantly
going round, there’s nowhere for
them to make up lost time. All this
leads to you being late into College.
In fact, plans are afoot to get rid
of the Circle line completely, by
changing the service patterns of
a number of other lines – but not
before 2011.
After all that stress, you might
decide to go out clubbing in the
evening. You come out of the club
at 2am... and realise that you’ve got
a long, bumpy night bus ride home.
Other cities run their metro systems
all night – why can’t we?
You might not have realised, but
London’s Underground is the old-
est in the world – the first section
opened in 1863! Like your elderly
grandma, it needs a lot of atten-
tion to keep it in working order.
Places like New York benefit from a
newer system which was built with
four tracks for many lines instead
of two (two slow, and two express).
They can keep running trains on
one pair whilst working on another.
We, on the other hand, need five
hours every night just to keep it
working during the day! It’s not all
bleak, though – the Mayor is con-
sidering running trains an hour or
two later on Friday and Saturday
nights. One day, you may stagger
out of the club and just catch the last
tube home!

exist without the time, effort and
enthusiasm of my excellent team of
volunteers.
If you have any comments or ques-
tions about Felix, or you would like
to submit a letter for publication on
any subject, please contact me at

Graduation
Last Wednesday, along with some
1900 others, I officially graduated
from Imperial College.
As I listened to the Union
President and the Rector describ-
ing Imperial’s illustrious history, I
couldn’t help feeling that the whole
experience didn’t mean as much as
it could have.
Everyone present had already
received their degree certificate by
post, many of us had already ‘moved
on’ from university into employ-
ment, and the ceremony itself took
place almost four months after our
degrees ended.
With the Government pressing for
50% participation in higher educa-
tion, acceptance at university set to
depend more on one’s finances than
one’s ability, and an increasingly
saturated graduate recruitment
market, it is difficult to escape the
conclusion that a degree is simply
not as valuable as it once was.
However, even if the qualification
is not worth quite as much, and the
ceremony was at the wrong time,
I could still reflect on some great
memories and be satisfied that I
had taken advantage of some of the
opportunities that Imperial life can
offer.
Your time here will pass quick-
er than you think and the piece of
paper you pick up at the end might
not be an express pass to the next
stage, so make the most of the stu-
dent experience while you can.
Parkinson’s Law
I was reminded recently of some-
thing called ‘Parkinson’s Law’,
which states that “work expands
to fill the time allowed”. I’m sure
you’ve experienced this law in action
on many occasions, as you franti-
cally try to complete some course-
work. Personally, I want to rename it
‘the Law of Editing Felix, Receiving
Articles After Deadlines and Not
Sleeping on Tuesday Nights’.
Enjoy this week’s issue.
