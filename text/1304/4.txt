Last week we began looking
at ways in which your com-
puter is vulnerable to attack
from crackers or malicious
individuals. This week we are
going to look at what vulner-
abilities are, why they are
bad news and how to protect
yourself in the best way pos-
sible.
As you all know, the soft-
ware you use on your com-
puter is made up of source
code, which is programmed
in a human readable compu-
ter ‘language’ before being
converted into machine exe-
cutable code and run. Really
large software, like an operat-
ing system such as Microsoft
Windows XP
, is made up of
lots and lots of this source
code, which in the case of
XP
, with over 40 million lines
of code, when printed out is
roughly equivalent to a 600m
high stack of A4 paper.
It is hard to keep track of it
all. Inevitably mistakes, also
called bugs, will creep in or
be overlooked. A bug is a flaw
in the coding, that means that
part(s) of the program might
not work correctly. Many bugs
are nuisances – a certain fea-
ture might not work correctly.
More irritatingly, a bug can
cause a crash and this can
result in the loss of work.
Serious bugs may result in
vulnerabilities such as buffer
overflows, where a malicious
user can run some of his/her
own code remotely on your
computer, doing all kinds of
possible damage without your
knowledge.
How do you get rid of these
bugs and vulnerabilities?
Keep your computer updated
regularly with patches for
your operating system and
software, which will update
the code so that these vulner-
abilities no longer exist.
For Microsoft Windows
users, visit windowsupdate.
microsoft.com (automatic
updating can be enabled
through the Control Panel).
For Apple Macintosh users,
visit www.apple.com/support/
downloads/.
For Linux/BSD users, visit
your distributor’s website
for information on the latest
patches.
It is true that Microsoft
Windows operating systems
have the largest frequency
of these patches, and hence
bugs, out of the operating
systems listed above. There
are many reasons for this,
but that is beyond the scope
of this article. A good idea
to increase security, and par-
ticularly to avoid spyware and
adware, is to try switching
to a web browser other than
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer,
which has frequent problems
(see picture, right) and which
these malicious programs
can exploit to install them-
selves on your computer.
Alternatives are aplenty,
the most popular ones includ-
ing Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox
(www.mozilla.org – both free)
and Opera (http://www.opera.
com – a free version is avail-
able). These will work on all
the main operating systems
listed above.
Many viruses and worms
use vulnerabilities on
unpatched systems to prop-
agate and cause damage.
The widespread ‘MSBlast’
or ‘Blaster’ worm, which
appeared in August last year,
caused massive havoc when
it infected hundreds of thou-
sands of Windows 2000 and
XP computers. As a result,
systems were rendered unus-
able due to constant reboot-
ing.
The Blaster worm exploited
a vulnerability in a part of the
XP or Windows 2000 operat-
ing system to infect systems.
The vulnerability had a patch
available for it for quite a long
time before it appeared. The
virus took advantage of the
fact that many people had not
bothered to keep their sys-
tems updated – an important
example of why you should
do so.
According to Microsoft’s
website, the vulnerability
allowed one to “run code of
attacker’s choice.” In the
case of the Blaster worm,
this was to download and run
itself. Once running on the
computer, the worm would
launch more attacks on other
computers to infect them, and
try to take down Microsoft’s
updates website using a tech-
nique called a Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS).
Another way of stopping the
worm infecting a computer
in this case would have been
to use a firewall to block out
unneeded parts of XP and
2000, which the worm used to
infect other systems.

Computer vulnerabilities and why you should keep yourself updated
Warning: security holes in software found on a daily basis

Last month, the $10 million
Ansari X-prize was won after
eight years of competition
between 27 privately-funded
teams from around the world.
The challenge was to send
a three-man craft carrying
at least one person beyond
100km above the earth twice
in a two week period.
Now the foundation behind
the prize is expanding its
remit, planning prizes for a
whole series of science and
technology breakthroughs,
described as “the greatest
challenges facing human-
ity in the 21st century”. None
have yet been laid down, and
the foundation is asking for
suggestions from the pub-
lic. To get you started, their
website offers a few ideas,
ranging from “a cure for can-
cer or other major diseases”
to “artificial intelligence, tel-
eportation, molecular assem-
blers (true nanotechnology),
cold fusion, or a believable
virtual reality system.”
This is a clearly a very dif-
ferent project. The original
X-prize aimed to encourage
the development of a private
space industry. Although it
will only ever be for the rich,
private vehicles would have
reached space eventually
sooner or later. The legacy
of the prize is that a small
number of rich people will be
able to pay to go into space.
In the end the lot of human-
ity has been changed little by
the success of SpaceShipOne,
winner of the original prize.
The new set of prizes has
loftier ambitions, but will
the same approach work for
the very different challenges
intended?
The jackpot, and the chal-
lenge itself, are motivational
and promotional devices.
Just like the original X-
prize, the prizes offered will
never match the sums need-
ed to meet the challenge.
SpaceShipOne won just
a third of the total $30 mil-
lion bill for the project, more
than $20 million of which was
picked up by Microsoft co-
founder Paul Allen.
Just as before, the prize’s
main role is to stimulate the
dedication of private funds
to research without imme-
diate, guaranteed commer-
cial value. Investors are
attracted by the concrete
and recognisable goals, the
benefits of being associated
with the ideals of the prize,
and widespread publicity in
the event of success. On this
basis, private individuals and
companies may already be
considering getting involved,
but the success of the new
prizes ultimately depends on
the scientific details of the
challenges set. Perhaps they
should think again: is it possi-
ble to set challenges that both
fulfil the aspirations of solv-
ing major problems, and still
work within the framework of
the competition?
A cure for cancer is per-
haps an example of the worst
kind, although it is certainly
aspirational enough. Whilst
the treatments available con-
tinue to improve, we are a
long way from ever eradicat-
ing the complex set of pathol-
ogies labelled as cancer. Few
researchers in the field would
admit to entertaining such a
possibility. More focused chal-
lenges closer to the realms of
possibility – such as an AIDS
vaccine – would be much
more powerful. Getting the
balance right is a very diffi-
cult task, and there is certain
to be a degree of risk in any
choice made. Perhaps it’s not
surprising that they’re asking
for a little help – make your

New X-Prize for “the greatest
challenges facing humanity”
“The jackpot and the
challenge itself are
motivational and
promotional devices”

Browsing through a news-
paper earlier this week, I
was suddenly confronted by
a headline: “Tea can help in
fight against Alzheimer’s.”
Startled, I read it again. Yes, I
was reading what I thought I
was. Great, I thought. I drink
loads of tea.
But I am, after all, a sci-
entist (OK... a student scien-
tist). Not wanting to become
too enthusiastic too soon,
I decided to read the small
print, which happened to be
the rest of the article. Soon I
found that my hope had dis-
sipated. Tea apparently con-
tains chemicals that inhibit
acetylcholinesterase, an
enzyme which hydrolyses
acetylcholine, a neurotrans-
mitter, in the synaptic cleft
(neural junctions). Reduced
acetylcholine can indicate, so
inhibiting the enzyme would
reduce the breakdown of the
chemical.
This sounded worryingly
familiar. Acetlyl cholineste-
rase inhibitors form a potent
weapon in many insecticides,
where they disrupt the nerv-
ous system of the pest, caus-
ing it to die. If I drank too
much tea, would this have the
same effect on me?
Admittedly this is unlikely; I
probably wouldn’t die of nerv-
ous system failure if I drank
too much tea. Yet this rais-
es an interesting point. Tea
also contains caffeine, which
is another chemical that has
various negative side-effects.
So, if I were an Alzheimer’s
sufferer and I drank 20 cups
of tea a day to try to increase
the concentration of the acetyl
cholinesterase inhibitors in
my body, the chances are that
I would develop conditions
that were damaging to my
health, rather than positive.
So are we, as consumers,
misled by research that is
specifically weighted so as to
promote a certain product?
Not that I am accusing tea
companies of fabricating evi-
dence for the health proper-
ties of their product; yet it
could be that a certain aspect
of the research results have
been highlighted to provide
an exaggerated illusion of
how healthy tea actually is. In
political circles, this may be
called ‘spin’.
There are other examples of
myths that surround certain
foods. Chocolate makes you
happy, for example. Maybe.
But if you were so desper-
ate to be happy that you ate
lots of chocolate and put on
weight, would you be satis-
fied?
I know of no-one who feels
that being fat is a necessary
prerequisite to being happy.
Similarly, red wine ceases to
be good for you when you
drink it in excess amounts.
We, as consumers, must be
sceptical of the information
presented to us by food com-
panies. Might a bright young
star in a cigarette company
one day turn around and
say: “Smoking reduces fertil-
ity; therefore cigarettes are
effective for use as contracep-
tion”?
Ultimately the question
must be whether we can
believe everything we hear.
In a market – indeed a world
– where misrepresentation is
commonly used to promote
an idea or illusion, we must
read between the lines. Often
there are underlying facts
that have been marginalised
when they should actually
have been emphasized. We
cannot trust those who use
information in a way which
benefits them rather than us,
the consumers.
In this day and age, it seems
that a certain amount of mis-
trust is vital.
Misrepresentation, illusion
and ‘spin’ in science
“In a market – indeed

Does tea really improve
your memory?
