How to build a house
This summer, eight Imperial College civil engineering students, a Whitybird engineer and a Hispanic
studies student from Nottingham went on an expedition to El Salvador, building a retaining wall and
starting work on 17 houses. Just in case you ever need to build a house, here’s how
By Michelle Maloney
You will need:
● spade / pick axe
● wire
● tape measure
● string
● wooden stakes
● long plastic tube
● rebar
● gravel
● roofing materials
● barras de castillas
● sticky back plastic
● glitter
● sand
● cement
1. Visit the beach for inspiration (very important for all civil
engineering projects) 2. Ensure that correct and appropriate safety wear is worn at all times
3. Prepare the ground: dispose of any tree roots, bones, remnants of abandoned latrines
etc discovered. Excavate the area to be built on
4. Recompact (by hand) the soil that you have excavated. Nurse your blistered, minging
hands. Set out the site and begin to dig trenches
5. Dig trenches and column footings. Concrete the house’s frame into place 6. Mix concrete for the floor slab (if you have enough water from the previous night’s rain)
