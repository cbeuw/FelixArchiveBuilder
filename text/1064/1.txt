Something for the
U L U resigned to A u t u m n chaos
A L E X FEAKES
The University of London Union's
academic year got off to a poor start
when one of its student sabbatical
officers resigned before any of the
College terms had begun.
Claire Lawrie, responsible for
Finance and Services at ULU, ten-
dered her resignation at the begin-
ning of September. The departure of
Ms Lawrie, mainly for family rea-
sons, has left her duties to be shared
out between the three remaining sab-
baticals, in particular President Sarah
White (President of Imperial College
Union last year). Speaking to Felix,
an undeterred Ms White promised
that "...the service we provide has not
been affected..."
Although the extra workload is con-
siderable and seventy to eighty hour
weeks have been reported, so far no
extra pay has been negotiated. Ms
White's appearance at Tuesday's
Imperial College Union Freshers Fair
was marked by a number of organi-
sational errors, interpreted by some
observers as a sign of the increased
workload taking its toll.
In addition, the search for a
replacement has been a source of dis-
sent among ULU regulars. Under the
University of London Union's con-
stitution, a free and fair by-election
must be held as soon as possible for
any vacant post. However, Felix has
received unconfirmed reports that the
post would be handled by a part-time
non-student member of staff and,
more recently, that one of the nomi-
nees for the post has admitted to
being 'managed' by Ms Lawrie her-
self.
A by-election has been scheduled

for Monday 14th October, this being
the first General Union Council of
the year. Each college in London
sends delegates to GUC, the sover-
eign body of ULU. By the close of
nominations, only two candidates
had been fully proposed and second-
ed. The first, Ben Hughes a self-
declared nominee of Ms Lawrie, is a
Masters student from University
College London but knows Ms
Lawrie from his BA studies at the
London School of Economics. The
second, who only just beat the dead-
line for the nominations, is a student
from Royal Holloway and Bedford
New College in south London.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Hughes
expanded on his plans for ULU, were
he to be elected to the post of Vice-
President for Finance and Services,
stating that his main aim would be to
increase accountability of the Union.
He made particular mention of the
finances of the organisation which,
he claims, are often only given curso-
ry notice and just 'rubber stamped'
by GUC. His previous experience of
office includes being a GUC delegate
for LSE for two years as well as
working with Ms Lawrie. over the
summer on afinancemanual.
Mr Hughes readily conceded that
Ms Lawrie had suggested he run for
the job, and named her as his "cam-
paign manager". This point in partic-
ular has been questioned by
observers with reference to the legit-
macy of an election where one candi-
date is so clearly favoured. Mr
Hughes went on to admit support for
the now discredited 'Campaign for
Free Education' (CfE), an NUS
splinter group determined to reverse
the recent change of policy by the
NUS executive to a more realistic
approach to student grants and high-
er education funding.
When pressed, Mr Hughes
revealed that although he would fol-
low any mandate given to him by
GUC, he would prefer join the cam-
paigners at the CfE demonstration
picketing the NUS Services confer-
ence, being hosted by ULU next
month. A statement by ULU con-
firmed they will play "no role what-
soever in this gathering of banner-
wavers."
