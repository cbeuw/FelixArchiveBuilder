2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 1 1TH OCTOBER
News in Brief
New Solutions
Attacked by CfE
N E W S T E A M
The University of London Union, the
original birthplace of the recently
reformed New Solution group (Felix
1063), is to be disrupted in the latest
battle with the Campaign for free
Education (CfE). The 20 November
is the date set for the CfE's march
which will start from ULU buildings
in Malet Street, central London.
Paul Bates, Vice-President of
ULU, is keen to distance his organi-
sation from the proceedings. In a let-
ter written to all University of
London colleges, Mr Bates insists
that "ULU is playing no role whatso-
ever in this gathering of banner-
wavers."
Mr Bates went on to say that
"Their protest is no more than a
provocative one - it was at ULU last
year that New Solutions began the
campaign for change in NUS". With
the 're-convening' of New Solutions
to fight 'top-up fees' it appears that
the CfE wish to embarass ULU.
While Sarah White, last year's
Imperial College Union President,
was heavily involved in New
Solutions this year's President, Eric
Allsop, is more reticent. He says that
although the CfE are "a load of
Trots" whom "no one will ever take
seriously", he has not got involved in
New Solutions and is unlikely to do
so in the future.
Mr Allsop questions whether New
Solutions have got carried away with
their success last year and whether
they are the right sort of group to
counter 'top-up fees'. He feels that
that this issue will have to be dealt
with on an individual basis, since it is
not a matter of lobbying government,
and he does not see how a 'discus-
sion group' can influence the deci-
sions of individual institutions.
SOUTHSIDE C A S U A L T Y
A potentially lethal cocktail of drink
and drugs led to a serious incident in
Southside bar last Monday night.
After drinking alcohol on top of pre-
scribed anti-depressants a Chemistry
PhD student collapsed in the popular
bar at around 9:30pm. The bar staff
were quick to react and move her
from the extremely crowded base-
ment area with an ambulance arriv-
ing at the scene just minutes later.
The girl's parents were contacted
by the College Security and taken to
the hospital, where it is understood
that she had her stomach pumped.
The postgraduate student has now
fully recovered from her ordeal. It is
also understood that she had only
consumed three drinks that night,
and had showed no signs of distress
before her sudden collapse. A full
security report is due to be complet-
ed early next week and it is likely
that no blame will be attributed to
Southside bar staff.

National Westminster Bank have
warned parents of the escalating cost
of sending their children to
University. A study of families
throughout the UK found that whilst
parents believed that it would cost
them around £5,500 to send their
children on a three year degree
course, the true figure is nearer
£12,000. David McLean, Head of
Personal Banking Services, Nat West
UK, said: "Parents are significantly
underestimating the total cost of their
child's education at university,
which is reinforced by over-opti-
mistic perceptions on how much
their son or daughter might borrow.
If provision is made early enough
and plans are made for the financial
burden that lies ahead, parents can
avoid sleepwalking into a nasty sur-
prise either for themselves or their
children."

Planning permission for the develop-
ment and expansion of the Imperial
College boathouse at Putney was
given the go-ahead at the second
hearing of the local borough plan-
ning committee during the Summer
vacation. The amended proposal,
prepared by the architects Troughton
McAslan, was approved by a 12:2
majority. The earlier proposal had
been opposed by David Mellor, the
local Member of Parliament.
This positive decision comes at a
time when Bill Mason picks up the
reigns at the club after a sabbatical
with the Great Britain women's
squad at the Atlanta Olympics.
"Bill's women" finished seventh at
the Games, but not before they had
recorded the third fastest time in his-
tory for any women's crew over
2000 metres.
BEIT HALL INTERNET
ACTIVITIES
The internet connections in Beit Hall
have hit further trouble this week as
College Residences do not approve
of the wiring. This means that all the
wires in the Old Hostel must be
checked and relayed.
Difficulties have also arisen in
meeting the demand for the facility
in the New Hostel, which faces onto
Prince Consort Road. The Old Hostel
was connected by running wires
directly from terminals in the Union,
but there are no connections close
enough to make installations in the
New Hostel in this way.
The current internet facilities in
student rooms raises questions about
the College's strict policies on com-
puter usage which are difficult to
implement in the privacy of student
bedrooms. Gerdjan Baker, who is
one of the subwardens in Beit Hall
and is involved in the installations,
suggests that while a student may be
able to download a pornographic pic-
ture in ten minutes magazines can be
bought off the top shelf at local
newsagents containing twenty such
pictures.
There are no current plans to
extend the internet facilities to other
Imperial College Halls of Residence.
The Centre for Computer Services is
apparently reluctant to finance such
projects due to concerns regarding
computer misuse and the temptation
for students to spend too much time
'surfing the net' at the expense of the
college studies.
