It's not been a good week for me
really (I'm not Alex, I'm Mark...
Alex is currently panicking so I'm
filling in). Firstly I got the 'IC Cold
& Cough' that's topping the misery-
charts currently. This has knackered
me totally, and thus I've been forced
to bed at the early time of before
1 lpm every night this week.
more arse
This is probably a good thing though,
as collating has hit critical mass; the
collating machine is broken, and
won't be fixed until next week. As
for SftW, the printing went wrong
and so the pages are in a somewhat
random order. Sorry about that.
even more arse
So now I'm probably not going to get
to bed until 5am, if that. Why?
Because we've got to hand collate
the 32 page SFTW, and so far there
are only 5 of us doing it. There are
about 5000 copies of SFTW, on 8
pages... so that's far too many bits of
paper each. Don't be suprised if
you're reading this next Wednesday.
but it's not all bad
No, really. M y timetable's quite
good this year - except for Friday,
when I start at 9am and finish at 6pm.
However, there's a compulsory
group project soon, and the groups
are assigned by the lecturers, so we
don't get to choose ourselves. You
might not think that's really so bad,
but I'm doing computing, so most of
my fellow Comp3'ers are rather sad
anorak types (sorry to the rest that
aren't).
relief
Right, I've stopped panicking
now, and I have reached that strange
stage of calm that follows the sudden
dawn of realisation that a sleepness
night lies ahead.
This is Alex again, and not Mark,
by the way and as you may have
gathered, it has been a rather difficult
week. Exploding collating machines
isn't the half of it. Freshers' Fair, the
start of lectures for the Felix regulars,
the late nights, the wine, women and
song, and the absolute deadlines.
As elaborated elsewhere in this
publication, there have been a num-
ber of Health and Safety problems
around College recently This has
rightly concerned a number of staff
and students alike, particularly when
areas such as the library have been
subject to gross oversights in con-
struction.
Although accidents and errors are
bound to happen in projects as large
as the Bio-medical Sciences building
and the Library refurbishment, as far
as possible those areas that are heav-
ily used should not be a risk to those
who use them. This applies equally
to sloppy concreting as to cutting
through a fire alarm cable.
Do 'accidents waiting to happen'
have to happen before suitable pre-
cautions or latent preventative action
is taken? Are the checks on standards
and safety that College abide by
being as stringently followed by
those it entrusts with keeping them?
Accidents shouldn't happen before
we find out.
