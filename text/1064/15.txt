summer sports report
Bannister's report
shows rugby favourite
Sir Roger Bannister's report on uni-
versity elite sport has shown that
despite the encroachment of
Associaton Football into our every-
day lives, on the university pitches,
Rugby Union Football still rules.
This disparity in favour between
the two goes further than pure prefer-
ence on the part of undergraduates, it
even extends to sponsorships and
scholarships and the funding of the
sports generally. Using the 1995-96
season as a benchmark, Sir Roger's
investigations show that football fig-
ures very little in universities think-
ing and is not proving as popular as
rugby union amongst students.
These findings are bourne out in
the figures. There are very few grad-
uates who now play Premiership
football, while the top rugby union
clubs have teams littered with gradu-
ates and students. Similarly, though a
few undergraduates play semi-pro-
fessional football at weekends, and
there are a few ex-school boy regis-
trations about, many more under-
graduates play rugby union for their
local or home clubs, as well as for
their university or college.
This postition may seem strange
when one considers the huge finan-
cial rewards and fame that accompa-
ny football compared to the 'ama-
teur' sport of rugby union. This has
changed now with the introduction of
professionalism into rugby, but why
do universities favour rugby with
scholarships?
Bannister's report sought to mea-
sure the success of ten sample uni-
versities who offered sports scholar-
ships over the last ten years. The uni-
versities scored points for any schol-
arship recipients who achieved any
international honour. Athletics came
out on top with 100 students receiv-
