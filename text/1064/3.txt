Nothing less than a great deal more
We are the world's largest business and technology consultancy. To build
on our success we must continue to set the standards that others must
follow - in the quality of our thinking, the quality of our service and the
quality of our people. That is why, when we recruit graduates, we recruit
only those who can deliver a great deal more than most in terms of
performance and potential.
In return, individuals who match our high standards can expect nothing
less than the very best: exceptional training; outstanding rewards and
benefits; exciting prospects for career development to Partner level within
a demanding and meritocratic organisation.
