4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 1 1TH OCTOBER
I C U Elections
ANDREW SMITH
With less than one week of the new
college year completed Union elec-
tions are already in sight with an
unprecedented three Imperial
College Union Officer positions up
for grabs. The Transport, Welfare
and Women's Officer positions are
due to be filled early next week with
just one candidate standing for each
of the jobs.
The eight ordinary members of
Council, elected by the students
rather than being ex-officio mem-
bers, are also due to be chosen on
Tuesday, at thefirstCouncil meeting
of the year. Two of these members
must befirstyear students and anoth-
er two must be postgraduate students.
As Felix went to press the postgradu-
ate positions were the only ones
which had not provoked any interest.
The Transport Officer post is
being sought by Duncan Tindall,
Civil Engineering, who at the end of
last year failed in his attempt to
become Council Chair. Mr Tindall is
fully seconded but it appears that his
former seconder has withdrawn his
support, with his name being crossed
of the Election Papers. The only can-
didate for Transport Officer also
faces the difficulty of not having
been a Minibus Driver for two years.
Union sources were unable to con-
firm whether this is a requirement for
the position and whether Mr Tindall
would be ineligible for election.
Heather Whitney is the only candi-
date for of Women's Officer, a posi-
tion which has become vacant with
the resignation of last year's elected
student. She is understood to be
spending a year in Sweden despite
having previously been elected
Women's Officer. Ms Whitney,
Biology Dept., is proposed by Neil
Mothew and is fully seconded.
The sole candidate for the position
of Welfare Officer is Emma Dedman
from the Physics Department. This
election is necessary as the previous-
ly elected candidate, Anne Ovens,
must take a year out and retake
exams in June 1997. Ms Dedman is
proposed by Paolo Cuomo from Elec
Eng, and is also fully seconded.
The candidates for Ordinary
Members of the Council include
some familiar names with Royal
College of Science Union current
and former officers, Rob Park and
Matt Szyndel standing for election.
Mr Park is the current RCSU Hon
Sec and Mr Szyndel is the former
RCSU Academic Affairs Officer.
Both candidates have proposers and
are likely to be fully seconded by the
time elections start. With nomina-
tions staying open until Tuesday
evening, and as all college students
are eligible to vote more candidates
are expected to make their intentions
known closer to the election date.
Successful fair for 'Active' Freshers

Tuesday's Freshers' Fair.
The Imperial College Union
Fresher's Fair, held last Tuesday
throughout college, proved a great
success with a huge turnout attracted
by more than a hundred stands.
Sarah Corneille, ICU Vice-
President Clubs and Societies,
expressed satisfaction saying "I think
that things went as smoothly as could
be expected. We seem to have quite
an active bunch of freshers this
year."
Neither Living Marxism or the
Tory Reform Group were to be
found amongst the stands in a change
to the published list of exhibitors.
The only note of discord on Tuesday
afternoon was provided by an
extremist Muslim group. They were
forced to leave the Queen's Lawn by
Union stewards and the Sherfield
walkway area by College Security
after handing out a leaflet espousing
their fanatical views.
Stripper acts for C & G freshers

A male and female stripper upset the
usually staid atmosphere of the City
and Guilds Union Freshers' welcome
held at the Royal Geographic Society
last Monday. Sir Ronald Oxburgh's
speech was followed by the stage
show which is believed to have cost
just Â£50.00.
To the wide eyed bemusement of
the assembled freshers the pair of
strippers got up on the stage, did their
act and disappeared. The C&G
Union are believed to have organised
the display.
Margaret Goodgame, Senior Tutor
to the College and one of the digni-
taries present during the official wel-
come of freshers, described the antics
as 'awful'. She said that students
should not have to put up with dis-
plays such as that witnessed on
Monday, and that it is likely that
some students would have found it
'unpleasant and upsetting'.
While Dr Goodgame has not
received any complaints about the
show put on by C&G, she suggest
that this may be due to students being
too shy to come forward. The Senior
Tutor does not see any way in which
the Union could be disciplined since
they did not break any specific rules.
Professor Julia Higgins, Dean of
the C&G, denied that she was con-
cerned by the events saying, "I am
not aware that there was any problem
with what may have occurred." The
events took place after she and the
other dignitaries had left the stage. Dr
Gareth Jones, College's other Senior
Tutors, who was also present prior to
the display was not so dismissive of
the strippers.
Dr Jones said that he was "very
disturbed to hear that this occurred".
He expressed anger at the event,
which he was unaware was planned
to follow the 'formal session'. It is
understood that The Royal
Geographical Society is also unhap-
py about the change of program.
While they have received a letter of
apology from the City and Guilds
Union President, Guarav Misra, no
decision has been made with regard
to future events.
IC Union President Eric Allsop
commented: "I had heard rumours
that such a stunt might take place,
and had advised C&GU that this
would probably be a mistake,
although how they present them-
selves to the student body is ulti-
mately their decision."
Mo Dulloo, Royal College of
Science Union President, indicated
that his organisation had no need for
such displays saying that "we used
simple interactive techniques to keep
the crowd going."
