By Cindy Drinnan
Another year, another
grudge match against Royal
Holloway. To be honest, it
was about time we beat the
jailbirds after letting them
leave with three points on
too many occasions in the
past. And beat them we did,
in convincing fashion.
We hit them hard from the
push back and were camped
in their 25 for the whole first
half of the game. The score in
fact could have been 10-0, but
we thought it best to spare
Royal Holloway any embar-
rassment and just pop in a
cheeky two.
The first goal came from
Chardonnay, as she followed
up a great cross from DJ
Flush. This was Chardonnay’s
debut goal for the firsts, and
the whole team could not help
but join in her elation. There
was a definite few minutes
of very girly jumping up and
down and screaming before
we decided to resume play.
Not long after, Moonie (man
of the match) scored a second
goal for Imperial. The pass
came from Anticlimax, who
used some nifty stick skills
to flick the ball past the oppo-
sition. These skills clearly
wowed the keeper who then
calculated that the only way
to stop the impending goal
would be to run into Moonie
at full speed... but it didn’t
work, she still scored!
Although it is not reflected
in the scoreline, Imperial con-
tinued to dominate in the sec-
ond half. In fact, so much time
was spent in the opposition’s
half of the pitch that Tyson
had to work hard to keep our
goalkeeper Spanner awake.
Royal Holloway tried their
best to taste a slice of the
goal pie, but their efforts were
to little avail. One player even
attempted to take her frus-
tration out on poor Womble.
Fortunately, she’s a hard nut
and can take it.
As the final whistle declared
we had achieved our first win
of the season, the excite-
ment could not be contained.
People were crying and hug-
ging each other all over the
place... well, not quite, but we
were very pleased!
Big thanks go to Spellcheck
for taking on the big yellow
fun bus and especially for
stopping at McDonalds on the
way home. Also to whoever
brought the lovely strawberry
cocktails... there was no bet-
ter way to celebrate our glori-
ous victory.
