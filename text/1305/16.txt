After last weeks attack of George
‘Dubya’ Bush, we here at Coffee
Break agreed that the only way for-
ward was to humiliate his ‘closest
ally’, Tony Blair.
Once again, we have used our
skills and world renowned contacts
to uncover Tony’s secret career as
a Z-list celebrity (I can see a pat-
tern emerging here!), before he
embarked on his life in politics.
I think you’ll agree that his port-
folio is impressive, but we need you
to tell us who eventually starred in
these roles and in which films?

Cryptic corner Goonies never say die!
I don’t think we’re being too contro-
versial here by saying The Goonies
rocked in a way that only mid-eight-
ies films can. It was an essential
part of growing up for people of
a certain age, and if you haven’t
watched it, trust us here, you’re
really really missing out. For no
particular reason, we’re doing a lit-
tle Goonies quote quiz this week. All
you have to do is work out who said
the following.
Mouth: Is this supposed to be
water?
?: It’s wet, ain’t it? Drink it!
?: Lookit! I got an idea. Why don’t
we just put chocolate all over the
floor and let Chunk eat his way
through?
?: I’m gonna hit you so hard that
when you wake up your clothes will
be out of style!
Chunk: Listen, okay? You guys’ll
never believe me. There was two
cop cars, okay? And they were chas-
ing this four-wheel deal, this real
neat ORV, and there were bullets
flying all over the place. It was the
most amazing thing I ever saw!
?: More amazing than the time
Michael Jackson came over to your
house to use the bathroom?
Francis Fratelli: Tell us every-
thing! Everything!
?: Everything. OK! I’ll talk! In
third grade, I cheated on my history
exam. In fourth grade, I stole my
uncle Max’s toupee and I glued it
on my face when I was Moses in my
Hebrew School play. In fifth grade,
I knocked my sister Edie down the
stairs and I blamed it on the dog...
When my mom sent me to the sum-
mer camp for fat kids and then they
served lunch I got nuts and I pigged
out and they kicked me out... But the
worst thing I ever done... I mixed a
pot of fake puke at home and then
I went to this movie theater, hid
the puke in my jacket, climbed up
to the balcony and then, t-t-then,
I made a noise like this: hua-hua-
hua-huaaaaaaa, and then I dumped
it over the side, all over the people
in the audience. And then, this was
horrible, all the people started get-
ting sick and throwing up all over
each other. I never felt so bad in my
entire life!
?: Holy S-H-I-T!
