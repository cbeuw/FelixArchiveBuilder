Spine-chilling horror, teeth-grinding
suspense and a dash of gore. This
and plenty more is what you’ll get
from watching The Grudge, the new
thriller brought to you by Sam Raimi,
which had me cowering in my seat
for the whole of its duration.
Just so that you get an idea, this
film is very much in line with the
other displays of modern Japanese
horror, as seen in Dark Water or
Ringu and the series of American
remakes of foreign cult classics such
as The Ring or Vanilla Sky. It seems
like Hollywood has seen potential
in the foreign film markets and is
interested in getting a good slice
of the benefits by remaking films
that have proved popular in their
country of origin. The basic formula
seems to be to select a good film,
throw some money at it, cast a hot
Hollywood lead (in this case read
Sarah Michelle Gellar) and shove it
right back on the market. The result
is usually a good film and significant
revenue.
The Grudge tells the story of Karen
Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an
American student working at a care
centre in Tokyo. She seems happy,
has a job in a care centre, a nice boy-
friend and speaks great Japanese.
Of course this isn’t going to scare
anyone, so the writer decides to
spice things up and sends her off to
care for a mysterious old lady that
spends all day in a daze. Unluckily
for Karen, the lady’s house turns out
to harbour a terrible curse.
You see, legend has it that when
someone dies in the grip of a power-
ful rage, a curse is born that gathers
in the place of death and those who
encounter it will be consumed by its
fury. Bad news for Karen, but good
news for horror movie buffs and
anyone who fancies a fright.
Seriously, mark my words, this
film is scary. I consider myself to
be a pretty brave kinda guy, but this
movie actually made people scream
in the theatre on several occasions.
May I also add: never has the sound
of a burp been so terrifying.
This won’t be winning any awards
in a hurry, though. Even though
the original idea is solid, the story
development is a bit poor. The main
problem is the lack of character
development. The story unfolds as
a mixture of scenes and flashbacks
corresponding to different points
within the timeline, resulting in a
series of characters that get intro-
duced and killed off within minutes.
This, added to some unconvincing
acting, renders it quite difficult for
the audience to establish a solid
bond with any of the characters.
The Grudge is also slightly repeti-
tive and you’ll find yourself guessing
what is coming next. However, this
is probably what makes the atmos-
phere so terrifying throughout the
film: the fear of what’s coming. The
movie is all about psychological hor-
ror and you’ll find yourself com-
pletely absorbed each time someone
goes up the winding staircase or
walks down the claustrophobic hall-
way. The director has elevated the
art of ‘scaring the hell out of you’ to
a whole new level.
Then again, he has made the film
enough times to get the balance
right. The Grudge is not just an
American remake of a Japanese hit
film. Shimizu had previously writ-
ten and directed Ju-on: The Grudge
in Japan as a remake of a couple
of straight-to-video releases based
on the same concept. The videos
were, in turn, inspired by a short
original film, released back in 1998.
A total of five films all based on the
same original idea have granted the
director complete control over your
bowels. Each noise, each camera
angle, each sudden volume rise is
perfectly timed and will have you
looking over your shoulder on the
lonely walk home.
So if you’re looking for a scary
movie that will get your new girl-
friend to cling on to you for protec-
tion, beware: you may find you’re
not that brave either.

The ultimate sacrifice
To coincide with Armistice Day 2004, Oliver Finn tells us about the war novel that you must read
Books books.felix@ic.ac.uk
Thursday 11 November is Armistice
Day 2004. On this day in 1918, the
‘war to end all wars’ finally came
to an end; the guns which for over
four years had pounded the sol-
diers of both sides finally fell silent.
Associated with this date in is
the Royal British Legion’s poppy
appeal, inspired by the vast fields
of poppies that grow on the bat-
tlefields of Europe. Armistice Day
is not just about giving to charity;
it is a memorial to those who have
lost their lives in service of their
country.
War is a terrible thing. Today’s
media goes to great length to dis-
play the dozens or hundreds of
casualties occurring in current con-
flicts around the world. In the First
World War, the casualties were not
dozens, hundreds or even thou-
sands, but millions of men, some
only boys, of various nationali-
ties lying across the battle lines
through France, Belgium and the
Netherlands. The sheer scale of
slaughter occurring at battles such
as Paschendale, The Somme and
Ypres is hard to comprehend. What
those few living veterans parading
past the Cenotaph in London this
weekend went through just can-
not be fully understood by someone
who was not there.
In All Quiet on the Western Front,
the author endeavours to give read-
ers some idea of what these men
went through. It is not a book of
action, adventure and heroics. It
is not a Hollywood tale of drama
and flag waving. The book tells the
story of a group of friends who
leave their school after a patriotic
speech by their teacher to sign on
in the German army. It follows one
of the boys from his initial training
through to his experiences in the
trenches; and in disturbing detail
describes the carnage and the
death of the front lines in World War
One. The book is quite simply the
most moving that I have ever read
– at several points it brought tears
to my eyes.
In one scene, the soldier is pinned
down in a shell crater in no man’s
land with an enemy soldier whom
he has just bayoneted. Unable to
move on, the main character can
only watch the man in front of him
die slowly.
The power of the story lies in the
way you can easily see why the char-
acter feels how he does. Because of
the way the story is told, it makes
you put yourself in the place of the
unknown soldier and causes you to
think how you would react and feel
in the same situation.
All Quiet on the Western Front
was first published in 1929 and
seen as one of the most compel-
ling anti-war arguments ever writ-
ten. Shortly after its publication,
the book was made into a film.
After reading it, you can see some
small measure of what happened on
those bloody fields so long ago.
The haunting notes of the last post
played at memorials around the
world will for me, and probably any
reader of this book, never be the
same again.
Everyone should read this book.
It promotes respect for those who
have fallen, understanding for
other servicemen and women, and
provides a wakeup call to those of
us who still think that war is ‘fun’
and whose perceptions come from
glorified Hollywood propaganda.
The book is like Saving Private
Ryan, but with ten times the
realism.
