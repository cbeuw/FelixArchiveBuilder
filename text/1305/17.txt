The hilarious Graham Chapman
was a major part of Monty Python’s
Flying Circus. But where is he
now?
FUCWITs
Look, we’d better be honest with you,
we’re not getting enough entries to
make an even halfway respectable
looking FUCWIT League. You guys
should enter! It’s not like it’s difficult
is it? Our very bare looking league
is somebody’s for the taking. Just
think, your name could be printed
here and you could win our prizes,
just for the hassle of emailing some
answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk.
Okay enough begging, we’re start-
ing to sound desperate. This week
we have four things for you to do:
Cryptic Corner: There’s three
points for each clue deciphered, but
if you get one, you should be able to
get the rest
Goonies Never Say Die: There’s
two points for each correctly identi-
fied quote
The Blair Film Project: There’s
two points for each picture – one for
the film, and one for the character
that Blair is replacing.
Dead or Alive: Tell us if the celeb-
rity in the picture is dead or alive,
and you’ll get two points for each
correct answer.

the West Wing of Beit Quad. Each week, we’ll choose a winner and print their name, thus
providing them with almost unlimited kudos and self-satisfaction. Everyone who provides

Dead or alive?
In todays’s celebrity-obsessed world, the life span of a Z-lister is just a matter of months. Of course, there was
a time when celebrities would hang around for ages, getting fat and old and eventually passing on to the great
sitcom in the sky. However, some of them choose to hang around, just getting fat and old and older. All you
have to do is work out which of these ‘stars’ are still around today.
George Wendt played Norm in
Cheers, and his character still grac-
es our screens today. He doesnt look
too healthy in this picture, so is he
dead or alive?
The lovely looking Anne Haddy, bet-
ter known as Helen Daniels from
Neighours. Is she enjoying retire-
ment in Oz or has she popped her
clogs for good?
What a legend. Slacker, smoker,
drinker, Greengrass was the dog’s
bollocks in Heartbeat. Is he still
smiling today? Dead or alive?
Ahh do you all remember Lassie?
Well she was a fit and healthy dog
back then, but how is she doing
now? Is she dead or alive?
Uncle Albert was old in Only Fools
and Horses. He died in the show, but
how about real life? Was that just for
retirement or did something else
happen? Dead or alive?
No need for me to give this man any
introduction, you all know who he
is. So tell us if this Bond has died
from his crazy lifestyle of too many
women and too many Martinis.
Julie Kemp, or Julie Goodyear MBE
as she should be known, is looking
very alive in this picture, but make-
up is always a good disguise. Dead
or alive?
