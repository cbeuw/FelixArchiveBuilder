Imperial Men’s 1st 2
Kent Men’s 1st 1
By Tom Gray
The flagship team of
Imperial Football Club sent
a tough Kent side packing
at Harlington on Wednesday
afternoon.
Joe McMahon’s first goal
of the season put the boys
in blue and black ahead, but
Kent’s number ten equalised
after some lacklustre mark-
ing in the Imperial penalty
area. The firsts saw this as a
wake-up call, and Oli Wright
slotted home the winner to
take three points and second
spot in the table.
The first half was a physi-
cal affair, with Wright and
Benji Marcos-Walker having
to work hard against some
strong Kent defenders. At the
other end, Kent were finding
it difficult to penetrate the
back line of Woodcock, Farr,
Mills and Gray, and when
they did, ‘keeper Vasquez was
on top form in between the
sticks. Imperial battled well
and earned the right to play
with McMahon and Berks
looking tenacious in the cen-
tre of midfield.
Midway through the half,
Kent’s ‘keeper pushed a low
shot from Marcos-Walker
around the post. Woodcock
delivered the resulting cor-
ner and McMahon rose high-
est in a crowded box to head
the firsts in front.
Minutes later, Marcos-
Walker found Wright with a
superb pass, but the captain
fired wide. The pressure was
building and Kent were glad
to hear the half time whistle
blow.
Imperial started the sec-
ond half brightly; a couple
of attacks nearly conjured
up goals straight after the
restart. They were playing
entertaining football and got
the ball out wide much more
than in previous weeks. Gray
and Ward were combining
down the right with Sugito
and Woodcock looking dan-
gerous on the left.
It could have been 2-0 when
a far post cross from the
left was headed back across
goal by McMahon, but Kent’s
‘keeper managed to get to it
first.
Although Imperial came
close, it was Kent who found
the back of the net. After a
rare spell of Kent possession,
a cross came in from the left
and the striker got to it first to
head home the equaliser.
Kent noticeably grew in
confidence after equalising,
but Imperial worked hard
to get back on top. Vasquez
was playing brilliantly in
the Imperial goal, fighting
bravely to claim a dangerous
looking Kent corner from the
left. Imperial thought their
chance to regain the lead
had come when Wright was
scythed down in the box, but
appeals for a penalty were
denied for the third time this
season.
Wright, perhaps looking to
justify his massive fantasy
football price tag, took advan-
tage of a poor Kent throw-in
deep in their half. He dispos-
sessed the defender and slot-
ted the ball past the ‘keeper
from a tight angle. An exuber-
ant celebration followed, but
the game was not yet won.
Substitutes Greedy and
Torossian were then brought
in and worked hard during
the final moments of the
game, but neither side could
create a clear cut chance.
The final whistle blew and
Imperial took all three points,
lifting them to second in the
table.
This solid, convincing
performance showed that
Imperial are real title con-
tenders in the tough BUSA
league.
Imperial firsts too strong for Kent

Imperial Men’s 1st 10
Buckinghamshire
Chilterns Men’s 1st 18
By Mike Hicks
Having not lost so far this
season, the ICURFC First XV
were confident of another vic-
tory. Sadly, Bucks Chilterns
were in the same position!
The game started with
some strong pressure from
the Bucks pack in our 22, and
we knew we were in for a
hard fought forwards battle.
To add to this, whenever we
cleared the ball up field, a
good opposition back three
sent it straight back!
This lead to Bucks spend-
ing most of the first half
inside our half, but the strong
Imperial defence conceded
just six points via penalties.
At half time we knew we
had to raise our game and
play to our strengths, not
theirs. Some good pressure
lead to Bucks conceding a
penalty on their 22, making
it 6-3. Unfortunately, as we
started to gain momentum, a
clearance kick on our 5m line
was charged down and Bucks
scored under the posts, giv-
ing them a 13-3 lead.
The Bucks captain was sent
for ten minutes off the field for
interfering with the ball in the
ruck, which had been happen-
ing all game. Unfortunately,
we couldn’t capitalise on
this advantage. The frustra-
tion began to boil over in the
Imperial ranks, culminating
in Higgins being shown a
straight red for stamping and
facing a lengthy ban.
Down to 14 men, we bat-
tled on with the game still
within our grasp. Good pres-
sure lead to Bucks conceding
a penalty, and a good kick put
us on the opposition 5m line.
From the lineout, a classic
drive on the second jumper
lead to captain Hicks going
over for a try. This was con-
verted by Spencer, and sud-
denly at 13-10 we were right
back in it.
However, some mis-com-
munication at a maul near
our line lead to several oppo-
sition forwards breaking off.
While the entire Imperial
pack defended against the
players without the ball, the
ones with it ran over for a try,
making it 18-10.
With the game now all but
over, another yellow card was
shown and Aung was sent to
the sin bin for some unneces-
sary footwork in a ruck.
Next week we face Reading,
knowing that victory is a must
to stay in contention for pro-
motion.
Rugby boys’
first loss

A ‘Herty’ victory
Imperial Men’s 3rd 3
Hertfordshire Men’s 3rd 2
By John Scott
Many years ago, in a land far
away, a wise man said: “a win
is a win, a draw is a draw, just
don’t lose”. This man subse-
quently died – people got pis-
sed off with him stating the
obvious and killed him.
It was with this tragic death
imprinted on our young minds
that we rode the ‘Venga Bus’
out to Hatfield, to do battle
with the evil Hertfordshire
Thirds. Our fellowship was
slightly weakened by the loss
of key players, such as Dom
‘The Idiotic’, a hardy dwarf
from the land of the North,
Jan ‘The Fullback’ and Adam
‘The Facial Hair’.
However, our intrepid
leader Shatters filled the gap-
ing chasm by calling up Ben
from the fifths and tinkering
with the formation.
The match began with a
minute’s half-silence for the
aforementioned murdered
man.
The game started in a blus-
tering fashion. Each side
traded insults until suddenly
Imperial Thirds took a dra-
matic lead. Matty Orford
unleashed a trademark ‘big
kick’ from the back. Leon,
who all game was at his twin-
kling best, allowed the ball
to drop over his head and
then nonchalantly volleyed it
in to ‘the Scott’ who turned
on a sixpence and released
Leon down the right. Leon
hit the byline and cut back
the cheekiest of cheeky cut-
backs, which was dummied
by the effervescent Perry
before being dispatched into
the far corner by a jubilant
Scott.
The lead was short-lived
– our normally rock solid
rear was unceremoniously
breached by an insertion
against the run of play. In
short, the little lad who liked
to ping it from the edge of the
box caught one well and it
eluded Matty and went in.
The defence were riled
– unused to being scored
against, they proceeded to
play the games of their young
lives. Shat-Ruso in the centre
solidly repelled wave after
wave of attack. Displaying a
symbiosis that would make
commensal bacteria blush
with envy, Timmy and Tom
at fullback were like angry
beasts, letting nothing past
and providing a good plat-
form for forays forward.
Perry, ever the architect
of mayhem, led his marker
a merry dance on a looping
dummy run. The ball broke
kindly to Scott on the edge
of the box, who turned like
a roundabout and sent an
unstoppable pea-roller past
the floundering keeper. Two-
one, game on.
After the restart, service
resumed as normal, and John
and Has picked up where
they had left off, harrying and
playing peachy killer balls.
Another ‘big kick’ by Matty
was charged on by Has, una-
fraid of competing with the
keeper and the two lumber-
ing centre halves. Scott hung
back slightly, then stuck a
toe into the mélée, connected
with the ball and crisply fin-
ished it.
At three-one up against the
leaders of our BUSA group,
I don’t think that we could
be reproached for becoming
a little complacent. So much
so, in fact, that Shatters
decided to ring the changes.
He thought that we should
all go to the bar and leave
rudimentary scarecrows in
our places to see whether
they could hold on to the lead.
We said that this was mad-
ness, so he decided to swap
Ben with Perry and leave him
with ten scarecrow team-
mates.
The plan was a bold one and
it nearly worked perfectly.
Hertfordshire couldn’t work
out how to get past Ben and
the scarecrows. They scored
once in the dying minutes,
a goal which I’m told Matty
scarecrow could have done
better with, however Ben did
a good job. So it ended a very
respectable three-two to the
Imperial. Well done chaps,
let’s keep it going.
FOOTBALL
Imperial Men’s 4th 2
Goldsmiths Men’s 1st 2
By Michael Nicholson
Theoretically this was the
toughest game of the sea-
son so far for the Fourths.
Goldsmiths are always a
strong unit, and approached
this game with added confi-
dence after triumphing in the
Cup last season.
It was, however, Imperial
who started the match with
greater vigour, with excellent
passing, movement and over-
all effort. Opportunities were
being carved out from all
areas of the pitch, but special
credit goes to Demetris and
Tony who caused all sorts of
problems down the right. An
Imperial goal seemed immi-
nent, but Goldsmiths’ experi-
enced ‘keeper had an excel-
lent game, controlling his box
well and making saves when
needed.
Goldsmiths began to take
hold of the midfield, and
clawed themselves back
into the match. A sustained
period of pressure saw them
win a corner on the right,
and despite clearing the ini-
tial cross, some neat passing
from Goldsmiths saw their
striker break clear and tuck
a neat finish past Vanni.
Imperial refused to buckle
and pressed on, but the
Goldsmiths’ ‘keeper’s omi-
nous good form kept the half
time score one-nil.
The second half was still
young when Imperial forced a
corner on the right. Demetris
produced a perfect cross,
which was headed home like
a bullet by Shwin continuing
his excellent goal-scoring
form. It got worse for shell-
shocked Goldsmiths when
Dave ‘the Hippy’ looped a
‘flower powered’ shot from 25
yards out. The ‘keeper was
fooled, thinking it would go
well over the bar, but it looped
neatly over his head into the
net, giving ‘the Hippy’ his first
ever strike in an Imperial jer-
sey and giving the Fourths
the lead.
However, the game ended
in a typical Fourth team
fashion, with the opposition
being gifted a scrappy goal.
A cross from the right wasn’t
dealt with properly and their
speedy midfielder, somehow
free in the middle of the box,
kneed the ball past Vanni.
Unlike previous games,
Imperial were spurred on
and really should have taken
all three points. But Jai and
Shwin both spurned decent
chances and the Goldsmiths
‘keeper made two absolutely
blinding saves from Chris
Parrot, excelling yet again on
the left.
The final whistle denied
the Fourths the win they
deserved. It was, however, a
performance they could be
proud of.
