Delight and dismay at US voters
Has Bush bitten off more than he can chew for the second time in a row?
Numaan Chaudhry reports
68m US voters chose to sup-
port George W Bush, the
winner of the US presiden-
tial election last week with
51% of the vote. The next four
years of Bush’s presidency
will effectively determine the
state of the world’s economy,
but whether that is a good
thing or not is anybody’s
guess.
The delighted
US citizens wait in anticipa-
tion for the first of Bush’s new
initiatives in his second term.
His much-publicised plan to
overhaul the Social Security
system started on Monday,
starting with the drawing of
new proposals brought about
by conclusions from the
bipartisan commission. Also,
Bush has suggested that he
will stay personally involved
to ensure completion of
this legislative package.
Under his payroll-to-stock
plan, a certain percentage of
payroll tax, currently 12.4%,
will be devoted to private
accounts, from which employ-
ees can invest in stocks and
bonds.
Investors in major indi-
ces worldwide grew a smirk
as the S&P 500, an overall
measure of the stock market,
gained over 1% after Bush’s
victory, along with increases
of the Dow Jones to 10,314
and the FTSE 100 to a two
year high of 4,718. Also, the
metal industry rose across
the board despite China’s
recent increase in interest
rates, in an attempt to curb
inflation rates, of which metal
exports were a major con-
tributor.
John Kerry’s concession
definitely helped the market
move decisively, and the equi-
ty markets were no excep-
tion. A Kerry victory would
be deemed negative because
of his desire to reverse tax
cuts and introduce policies
that are viewed as unfavour-
able for pharmaceutical and
environmentally sensitive
sectors.
George W Bush must
be absolutely chuffed. He
endured, very remarkably,
the 11 September attacks,
major accounting scandals
and a global recession. His
administration actually did
really well to keep the US
economy afloat. In addition
it has to be admitted that,
relative to the attacks of 11
September, no significant ter-
rorist activities have taken
place; rather it is Bush’s
attacks that have come under
scrutiny.
The pharmaceutical indus-
try breathed a sigh of relief
as they lay beyond the reach
of Kerry, the failed presiden-
tial candidate seen as more
hostile towards this industry
because of his intention to cut
medicine prices.
The dismayed
Families of dead soldiers in
Iraq have expressed their
disgust at Bush’s re-elec-
tion, calling it “unworthy”
and “stunning”. From the
time Bush’s ‘war on terror’
began after the attacks of
September 11 and before the
official handover in June this
year, almost 9000 troops have
died or been fatally wounded
(from both enemy and coali-
tion fire).
The series of blunders at the
beginning of the war, includ-
ing the shooting down of a
coalition apache helicopter
and ground troops, clearly
justifies Bush’s re-election as
truly stunning.
The financial cost, however,
is mind boggling. Despite the
US’s $10 trillion economy,
the $150bn spent is beyond
comprehension and another
factor that seems to have
passed beyond the American
people in their voting strat-
egy last Friday, although it’s
comforting to hear that Bush
was spending conservatively
when he said, “What’s the use
of sending a $2 million missile
into a $10 tent to hit a camel
in the butt?”
Although the equity mar-
kets and world indices
rejoiced at Bush’s victory,
the dollar made a record fall
against the euro despite the
US economy showing healthy
signs: among them, a 37,000
increase in employment in
October and an alleviated
US deficit accumulation.
Bush persisted in conveying
his plans to truncate the US
trade and industry deficit of
$410bn by instigating budget
cuts and relying heavily on
economy growth. He claimed
that tax reform or any other
consumer-affecting means
would not be undertaken, to
a significant amount at least,
to bring the nation out from
the red. Also, the increase in
employment is only a tempo-
rary hike that Bush no doubt
created to add to his posi-
tive contribution to the US
economy. The fact is that over
821,000 jobs have been lost
since Bush took the reins four
years ago.
When nine Nobel prize win-
ners in economics concur that
the Bush administration went
“on a reckless and extreme
course that endangers the
long-term economic health
of our nation”, some serious
thinking needs to be done on
the outcome of this election.
The nine campaigners for
Kerry cited “poorly designed”
tax cuts that instead of creat-
ing jobs had transformed the
budget surpluses left by Bill
Clinton into enormous defi-
cits, adding that this “fiscal
irresponsibility threatens the
long-term economic security
and prosperity of our nation”.
Among those involved in this
statement were Kenneth
Arrow and William Sharpe
of Stanford University, Paul
Samuelson of MIT and Daniel
Kahneman of Princeton.
And the furious
I’m confident that millions will
join me as I show my disgust
at the outcome of the elec-
tions. How could the majority
of US citizens vote for some-
one who clearly can’t make
his own decisions, stumbles
at everything unexpected,
be it rocks on the ground or
questions from the press, and
is absolutely out of touch with
the world economy. As Bush
heads for the presidential
retreat this weekend at Camp
David, I might just make my
own retreat into the US Yahoo
groups to delve into the typi-
cal American mind. Findings
next time...
Debenhams
Debenhams, the thriving
department store and recent
acquisitor of CVC Capital
Partners, reported net profits
of £300m attributed to a 5%
increase in sales. Now there
are plans to increase its high
street exposure by opening
another 20 new stores across
the UK.
Marks and Spencer
The struggling retailer final-
ised the sale of M&A money
to HSBC, although under the
contract of the deal, M&S
will retain 50% of profits until
2014. The sale is expected to
free up cash as Stuart Rose,
the new Chief Executive
appointed in August, strug-
gles to bring M&S back up
on it’s feet.
Vodafone unveils 3G
In preparation for enter-
ing the 3G market, along
with Orange and T-Mobile,
Vodafone announced ear-
lier this week it’s new 3G
service following a £20bn
investment in digital
licences and technology for
it’s new handsets.
Vodafone hopes to become
a formidable rival to 3,
currently the UK’s largest
distributor of 3G-enabled
handsets. The new serv-
ice aims to provide users
with the ability to utilise
video capability and
download music. Legally, of
course.
