An entirely black page, with
two words in small type in the
centre: ‘Oh, God’.
Thus The Guardian greet-
ed the biggest news story of
the past year, yet alone the
past week. “Once is an aber-
ration. Now it is an era... he
will be no footnote to history;
instead he is making it” said
the paper, who admitted that
they “don’t like it one bit”,
and in that they were not on
their own.
The Daily Mirror devot-
ed the entire front page
to one headline asking,
“How can 59,054,087 peo-
ple be so DUMB?” and The
Independent had the same
sentiment, if a bit more tact-
fully put, in their montage
of photos from Abu Ghraib,
Guantanamo Bay and Iraq.
Many commentators were
surprised and shocked by the
emergence of ‘moral values’
as the most important issue
in the election; it seemed
that voters ignored their
misgivings about Iraq and
the economy to vote for the
candidate who felt the same
way that they did about guns,
gays and God. Nearly all the
papers also ran some sort of
article on the ‘Divided States
of America’ – the electoral
map showing Democrat coast
lines and solidly Republican
inland states, where it seems
that “apart from the fact that
they speak English and have
two legs apiece, it is hard to
think of anything American
conservatives have in com-
mon with European liberals”
according to the Guardian,
which claimed that the elec-
tion was a moment for Tony
Blair to step away from
America and towards Europe,
with whom we have far more
in common than an electorate
who believe their country has
been ‘chosen by God’.
Some papers were pleased
with the result, however. The
Telegraph thought that the
result would “strike fear into
all enemies of America and
the West” now it is clear that
Mr Bush has support from the
American public to continue
his task in the war on terror.
The paper urges Europeans
to attempt to understand the
American people and there-
fore the President, and not
to become complacent: “The
country he leads is diverging
from Europe: it is younger,
more self-confident, more
prosperous, more devout,
more diligent, more demo-
cratic and, in short, more
conservative. Europe must
come to terms not only with
Mr Bush, but with the nation
that has elected him. This is
a president who really can
speak for America”.
The Sun took a similar
line, put in the inimitable
words of Richard Littlejohn,
who ranted: “Michael
Moore, Osama bin Laden,
Saddam Hussein, Jacques
Chirac, Gerhard Schroeder,
Kofi Annan, Yasser Arafat,
the BBC, Guardianistas,
Channel 4 News, Robin Cook,
Clare Short, most of the
parliamentary Labour party,
half the Tory party, Charlie
Kennedy, your boy took one
hell of a beating”.
The Times took a more
grown-up line on the elec-
tion than most of the other
newspapers, with the leader
urging Mr Bush to use his tri-
umph to push for peace in the
Middle East, which most pun-
dits agree is the most urgent
issue currently facing the
President. Tony Blair joined
in that chorus, stating in his
first speech after the election
result that peace in Palestine
was “the single most press-
ing political challenge in our
world; we must be relent-
less in our war against ter-
rorism and in resolving the
conditions and causes on
which the terrorists prey”.
George Bush, however, did
not mention the Middle East
in his acceptance speech.
The Independent picked up
on this, suggesting that Mr
Blair must be praying that
the President does not decide
to attack Iran, a situation that
would be nearly impossible
for Mr Blair to respond to
without outraging either the
Americans or his own parlia-
mentary party.
