TV is rubbish these days
As a student, your finances are
probably tight. You have to budget
for everything, so you would prob-
ably be forgiven for missing out on
certain things. One thing that nearly
always gets left by the wayside is
your TV Licence (and I don’t blame
you, given the rubbish they put on
telly these days).
However, as I’m sure you’re aware,
you could be fined up to £1000 if
caught without a licence. Just to
make things easier, you might face a
court appearance as well!
There are some myths that float
around about TV licences. I am not
writing this to tell you to get one, but
this article is intended to tell you the
facts and your rights if the men or
women in the detector vans come
knocking at your door.
If you look at the TV Licensing
Agency (TVLA) website, you might
think they are trying to explain
things to six-year-old kids, not grown
adults. Anyway, here are some facts
that may help you:
When do you have to buy a TV
license?
● If you use a TV that is current-
ly receiving programmes, you will
have to get a licence. You’ll also
need one if you are using anything
else to receive programmes, such as
PCs or video recorders.
● If you are living in halls and
have a TV in your own room then
you need your own separate TV
licence.
● If you live in a house which has a
joint tenancy then only one licence
is required for the whole house.
However, if there is a separate ten-
ancy for each room then each room
that has a TV will need a separate
licence.
There is some good news though.
As a student, you are entitled to
some money back for the summer
months if you can prove that you are
no longer residing in the house that
the licence was bought for.
Those nice people at TV Licensing
also target heavy student-populated
areas, which is nice of them consid-
ering that some students can’t even
afford to put food on their plate let
alone pay a £1000 fine.
What are your rights?
● You are under no obligation to
allow a TV Licensing enquiry officer
to enter your home unless he/she
can show a search warrant.
● If you open a door and the enquiry
officer does not have a warrant and
starts questioning you, you do not
have to answer. Basically just say
nothing and shut the door.
● If an enquiry officer tries to enter
your home without a warrant, this
is unlawful.
● The TVLA have to apply to the
magistrates’ court to get a warrant
to search your property. This can
take a bit of time, although it will
certainly be given.
● If it gets to the point where they
want to search your home, you have
the right to see the warrant and
ask for a copy. They are allowed
to search your property without a
police officer present, however in
most cases the search is conducted
in the presence of a police officer.
You are allowed to ask for a copy of
the police officer’s search warrant
as well.
● If you do get fined, there are pay-
ment plans available to you. Contact
the Union Advice Service for advo-
cacy and more information.

or you are just interested in the
issue of students and TV licens-
ing, please contact the Union
Advice Service on 020 7594 8067 or

Innumerable people have stopped
meinthestreetsofSouthKensington
recently to ask, “Sam, what’s all this
about Single Transferable Voting?
What’s wrong with just putting an
‘X’ next to the candidate I prefer?” A
very good question indeed, and one
that I shall attempt to answer here.
The Single Transferable Vote
(STV) is a system that has been
developed to give the voter more
power than in the traditional ‘first
past the post’ system favoured in
UK General Elections. STV is a form
of preferential voting, which means
that instead of casting a single vote
for a single candidate, a voter can
express a list of preferences. Votes
are cast by putting a ‘1’ next to the
voter’s preferred candidate, a ‘2’
beside their second favourite candi-
date and so on, until they no longer
wish to express a preference.
When it comes to counting the
votes, a quota is calculated which
sets the number of votes a candi-
date must attain to be elected. This
is simply the total number of votes
cast, divided by one more than the
number of candidates to be elected,
plus one vote. By following this for-
mula, no more than the required
number of candidates can reach the
quota. Votes are counted according
to the first preferences, and any
candidates who have achieved the
quota are elected.
To decide which of the remaining
candidates are elected, the votes
are transferred from candidates
who have more than the necessary
number to achieve the quota and
from the candidate with the least
number of votes. This means that
where the first preference of a voter
was not able to be used to elect a
candidate (or not necessary, in the
case of a candidate who has reached
quota), their subsequent preferenc-
es come into play. This process of
transferring votes continues until
the required number of candidates
have attained enough votes to be
elected.
“It sounds like an awful lot of
effort! So, what’s the point of STV?”
they may retort. Well, it’s not that
arduous to think about who your
second or third choice candidates
are, and remember, you can stop
when you have no further prefer-
ence. The main benefit of STV is
that it avoids wasting votes in so-
called ‘safe seats’, where one can-
didate might be streets ahead of
the others – in this case, the second
choice candidates will make a real
difference. Or, similarly, you may
want to back a candidate who ends
up getting eliminated – your vote
would not be wasted, as your next
preference will be reallocated to a
candidate who’s still in the race. All
in all, it empowers the voter.
The second question I’ve been
asked is “who’s RON?” Re-Open
Nominations, or ‘New Election’ is a
way of expressing your displeasure
with the remaining candidates, and
requesting that nominations are
reopened for a new election. The
reason we are holding these by-elec-
tions is because RON did well last
time, knocking out many “human”
candidates.
It’s important to remember that
voting for New Election is not the
same as abstaining. Various people
have said to us that they didn’t know
any of the candidates, but wanted to
ensure that the 25p donation went
to their club, so just voted RON. In
response to feedback from various
quarters, we have decided to modify
the voting system to introduce the
‘Abstain’ option this time. The anal-
ogy for a paper ballot election is
going into the voting booth and writ-
ing “Mickey Mouse” on your paper,
or spoiling the ballot slip in some
other way. If you do this, your vote
will not count towards the election,
but you will be able to make your
donation.
What am I trying to say? Voting
matters (more than doughnuts do),
and you should get involved in the
running of your Union. Nominations
close at noon tomorrow (Friday), so
it’s not too late to stand. Hustings
are being held in the JCR at noon
next Thursday, 18 November, so
come along and quiz the candidates!

Radio to the power of Four
Whilst writing this column I hap-
pen to be listening to the Today
programme in my office. What is
Today, some of you might ask?
Today is BBC Radio 4’s flagship
news programme. It is the most
widely heard breakfast news radio
show in the UK. There’s a good rea-
son for that.
Many of you might stare aghast at
the mention of Radio 4 in a students’
newspaper. Many seem to consider
it the radio station for old fuddy-
duddies. The fact is, however, that
Radio 4 represents the crown jew-
els of the BBC’s license fee funded
provision.
Firstly, Test Match Special is the
only practical way to keep up with
the cricket (it’s far too tedious a
game to actually watch most of the
time). More importantly, we are the
generation least likely to watch tel-
evision. How are we to keep up to
date with current affairs without
television news?
Several people have suggest-
ed newspapers to me – and they
certainly have their place. But in
today’s internet age, newspa-
pers are no longer really about
breaking news. The strength of a
good newspaper (such as Felix)
is actually providing comment on
the major matters of the day. The
hallmark of a bad newspaper
(such as London Student) is
to simply recycle what more
up to date forms of media pub-
lished hours, days (or in LS’s case
months) ago.
Some people point to the inter-
net and say that’s the way to keep
up to date. But that’s really too
much effort. One can’t spend all
day reading BBC News Online.
Personally I find the internet
more convenient for reading news-
paper articles that I’m interested
in (again comment, not news). The
only news I get off the web is inter-
net/technology related news. But
then Slashdot.org isn’t really for
everyone.
No, in this day and age, radio has a
serious purpose. It’s so much easier
to listen to radio and absorb it whilst
eating/sleeping/working, etc. That’s
why Radio 4 is so important. For
the post-TV generation, a pervasive
intelligent speech radio station is
essential for an information society
to work.
Why am I talking about this?
Several reasons. Firstly, it’s my job
to keep abreast of issues that affect
students, and listening to Today
is basically how I keep abreast of
political matters (whether they
be tuition fees or something more
obscure like immigration rules that
could affect overseas students).
Secondly, I like Radio 4 and wanted
to tell everyone. Thirdly, I wanted to
plug intelligent speech on your radio
station. Tune into IC Radio (www.
icradio.com) and listen to Fireside
for my (almost weekly) phone-in
with the Felix editor on Thursdays
at 6pm.
