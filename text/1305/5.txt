“I spent most of my summer
working in Delaware this
year...” “...Dela-where?” is
how many a conversation has
proceeded recently.
Yes, I was one of the cho-
sen ones, selected by UROP
(the College’s Undergraduate
Research Opportunities
Programme) to participate
in the exchange with the
University of Delaware in the
USA. My reward for getting
through the application and
interview (it helped that I
had done UROP the previous
summer) was a nine week
placement in the Sharp phys-
ics laboratory, which gave me
the opportunity to experience
the black art of theoretical
atomic physics.
Giddy with the feeling of
post-exam exhilaration, and
excited at the prospect of
doing some real world sci-
ence, I arrived with four other
Imperial students (Darwin,
Hudaa, Pan and Chris) in
Newark, Delaware with some
sense of expectation. We were
not to be disappointed.
Delaware is a greenish state
with many highways between
small cities, but with the
friendliest people – and this
was epitomised by the staff
of Delaware’s Undergraduate
Research Program. An exam-
ple of this endemic friendli-
ness is that if we were ever
in need, they would fix it for
us, so when I mentioned off-
hand that there was no kettle,
what did I find the very next
morning outside my door,
but a brand new kettle! The
campus had a similarly nice
feeling to it – there were long
green lawns, without signs
saying that you can’t walk on
them, a bell tower that played
parochial melodies, and all
the campus buildings were
built in the same grand style.
For the first seven weeks
we lived in dorms – each
with an American roommate
– alongside other like-mind-
ed souls trying to embellish
their CVs. It was easy to make
friends and we had a lot of fun
together in various bars and
restaurants. We also enjoyed
the activities organised by
the UROP representative in
our hall. Due to Delaware’s
location, day trips followed
to New York, Washington,
Philadelphia and also the
beach at Rehoboth (my per-
sonal favourite).
We were also there for the
Independence Day celebra-
tions and the mourning of
Ronald Reagan, so we got a
nice big dollop of American
culture. Speaking of dollops,
theAmericansenjoytheirfood
– especially their fast food!
However, I have to pay trib-
ute to the great Philly chees-
esteak, which is now possi-
bly my favourite pick-me-up.
Americans also like to keep fit
(honestly), so take note of the
free gym and indoor/outdoor
pools on campus.
I also managed to accom-
plish a lot of work! My super-
visor understood my relative-
ly novice position so with the
tasks assigned to me within
my limits, I found myself in
a very stress-free position. I
learnt practical skills on the
programming side and how
to research topics, and a lot
about a researcher’s life in
the US. I also made a lot of
mates out there who I keep
in contact with, bringing me
to possibly the most exciting
part of the exchange program
– the home stay.
For the final two weeks, I
stayed with Susan (a sweet
middle-aged woman who
did her utmost to keep me
entertained) and her family
in Newark who had been kind
enough to open their arms
to me. Initially petrified by
the prospect, this part of the
exchange really gave me an
opportunity to learn more
about American culture, and I
suppose that is the thing that
I miss most – the friendliness
of everyone wanting to show
me their part of the country.
I would thoroughly recom-
mend it to everyone! If you
want to find out more, UROP
will stage a presentation
about the Delaware Exchange
at 1.10pm on Thursday 18
November in Room 342 of
the Mechanical Engineering
Building on the South
Kensington Campus. Beware,
the deadline for applications
will be 25 November. Watch
out for details on the website.

US develops new
Anthrax vaccine
The Californian company
VaxGenwillmakeanimproved
version of the anthrax vaccine
for use in case of biological
attack under an $877m con-
tract, the first to be funded by
the “Project Bioshield” law
enacted in July. The new vac-
cine uses a specific protein
from the bacteria, called pro-
tective antigen, and will be
available in 2007.
China aims for five
days in orbit
China’s second manned
space mission, scheduled
for next year, will carry two
astronauts and is expected to
orbit the Earth for five days.
Mission scientists said they
had been working to optimise
the performance, safety and
reliability of the spacecraft,
Shenzhou VI. China’s first
manned mission, Shenzhou
V, launched into space in
October 2003.
Source of cosmic
rays confirmed
Using an array of four tel-
escopes in Africa, scientists
have produced the first image
showing that the source of
cosmic rays could be the rem-
nant of a supernova, a power-
ful explosion of a star at the
end of its life. It had long been
thought that supernova explo-
sions were indeed the source,
but there was no evidence to
support this theory.
Mars rover gets
power boost
Opportunity, one of the two
robotic rovers exploring
the surface of Mars, has
mysteriously produced about
5% extra power in its solar
panels. It is thought that
this is due to a storm blow-
ing dust off the panels.
Both robotic explorers have
discovered geological evi-
dence of past water activity
and are continuing to send
back data.
Pot of Roman cos-
metic unearthed
A sealed pot of ointment was
found at an archaeological
dig in Southwark. Analysis
revealed it to be made from
animal fat, starch and tin
oxide. It is speculated that
the cream was used as a cos-
metic to achieve a pale look.
It leaves a smooth texture
when rubbed into the skin.
Marks left by the last fingers
to use the pot were still vis-
ible on the lid.

A DAY IN THE DIET OF A STUDENT
Our resident dietician evaluates your lifestyles science.felix@ic.ac.uk
Darius Nikbin, Science Editor, describes his diet and lifestyle
8am Grab a piece of white toast with jam and a coffee. Cycle to Hammersmith for ten minutes, then take the bus
12pm Go to the Union and have the legendary ‘chilli beef with rice’. Inevitable pain in stomach, but worth it
3pm Over-priced snack at the SCR and have another coffee
5pm Back home after college (10 minute cycle). Have some biscuits with tea. Listen to some music, read notes
7pm Have dinner, usually a plate of rice with a couple of fried chicken drumsticks and a salad
9pm Go down the pub and have a couple of pints with some friends. Come back and watch an episode of Columbo from the newly released DVD
Rosie Taylor, Felix Science dietician says...
Student total calorific intake: 2500 calories Recommended (male) calorific intake: 2500 calories
Darius eats on the run, grabbing fast food as a means of filling a gap. He does well to eat regular meals and snacks, not missing meals or eating huge
amounts in one go. This means that he is getting a regular supply of energy throughout the day.
One slice of white toast and jam for breakfast isn’t enough. He would be better off having some low glycaemic index carbohydrates such as porridge or
granary bread. His lunch is lacking in vegetables. As we should all be consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, lunch is a good time to incor-
porate a portion. He does better with his evening meal, including a salad.
His diet is also lacking in fruit. Fruit would provide an ideal mid-afternoon and 5pm snack. Fruit would provide him with essential nutrients and fibre. I am a little
concerned about Darius’ fluid intake. He seems to get through the whole day one just two cups of coffee, a can of coke and a few pints of beer. We should
drink 6-8 glasses (or 1¾ litres) of fluid each day, not including alcohol. He falls short of this amount, which could lead to under-hydration.
