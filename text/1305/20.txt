Issue 1304 solution
Cambridge Univ 957
Imperial College 927
By Sam Dash
Last Saturday, Imperial
College Rifle and Pistol
Club set off with seven fine
shooters for match against
Cambridge University Rifle
Club. It was a smallbore
rifle match, shot indoors, at
25 yards with teams of five
shooting two cards totalling
100 points each.
We met and set off from
Kings Cross, and all man-
aged to get on the right train
despite someone not meeting
us at the station! After about
45 minutes of misty country-
side and much talking, we
arrived in Cambridge.
The Cambridge range is in
a really weird place, under
a bridge, so weird that even
the taxi driver didn’t know it
was there! When we arrived,
we were treated to a small
tour of their really large
range. They have a huge
club room with a pool table,
a large 11 point rifle range,
and a separate air weapons
range capable of holding
around 15 people. It is no
wonder with these facilities
that this is the Rifle Club
that not only won the BUSA
Rifle Championship but also
produced the last Queens
Prize winner. To win the
Queens Prize is considered
to be the highest achieve-
ment in the rifle shooting
world.
Admittedly we were the
underdogs in this competi-
tion. Some of our best team
members could not make
it (Tim decided that Clay
Pigeon shooting was more
appealing) and that meant
that we had to use someone
who had not shot a rifle in six
months.
We also had two beginners
with us. One of them, Fan,
had shot only once before,
but was willing to give it a
try and did really well. We
were also not using our own
rifles, due to difficulties with
transporting weapons. This
meant that no-one was used
to the rifles they shot with.
This gave the Cambridge
shooters a great advantage,
but they were all impressed
by how well we did. Despite
our disadvantages, we had
a great shoot, and everyone
really enjoyed it
It is worth pointing out
that the highest scorer from
Cambridge achieved 195
and the rest of their team
got scores above 189. The
Imperial College team would
usually get above this on a
normal day, if not more. You
will be pleased to know that
we are intending to arrange
a return match, for them to
come and shoot in London,
and then we will be able
to beat them on our home
ground.
After the match Isao,
Gary and Shan went back to
London, while the rest of us
enjoyed a formal dinner at
Emmanuel College with the
Cambridge team. After lots
of wine, a few table football
matches at the college bar
and a random Greek party at
Darwin College, we headed
to bed. A fine day and evening
was had by all.
