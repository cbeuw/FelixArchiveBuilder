CLUB REVIEW
The first time I went to Turnmills, I
wasn’t that impressed. The people
seemed rude, it felt overcrowded,
the main dance floor felt too much
like a corridor and the cloakroom
was more expensive than the only
other big club I’d been to at the time,
Heaven. Since that fateful night how-
ever, the ‘Mills has grown on me, and
I now count it as one of my favourite
venues, easily amongst the best in
London.
It’s a joy to wander around, with a
seemingly endless supply of nooks
and crannies to squeeze yourself
into, absolutely loads of space to sit
down, chat and people-watch, mil-
lions of bars, great décor and at least
three separate rooms to check out.
And that’s before you even get to the
awesome main room.
At the peak of the night, when
all the drinkers have gone home to
leave more space for the dancing
hardcore, it is a joy to behold and be
part of. Lowish ceilings, excellent
sound filling the intimate space and
surrounding you, dark with the faint
smell of the smoke machine hanging
in the air and the mythical Turnmills
light show (I have never thought it
to be overly impressive in terms of
content, but it’s always has an out-
standing effect) including London’s
first ever multicolour laser (sadly,
not in use tonight) in full swing, you
can’t help but dance, and neither can
the 999 people next to you. Throw in
a shedload of quality music played
by the world’s most respected DJs
and you have the perfect recipe for
the perfect night.
Which is why, in days when a pro-
motion is lucky if it gets to its first
birthday, the Gallery has been enter-
taining London’s sophisticated club-
bers on a weekly basis for ten years.
This fact alone should give you some
indication of the quality on offer. That
night, I was going to be introducing
one of my new classmates to the joys
of London clubbing and so I couldn’t
think of anywhere more appropriate
or reliable than the Gallery in which
he should take his first steps into a
whole new world.
We arrived early and paid the
exceptionally student-friendly price
of £10, and we didn’t even have to
ask. The bouncers asked if we were
students, we flashed our swipe cards
and got tickets with 33% off the usual
entrance fee. No fuss and friend-
ly bouncers – brownie points for
Turnmills already.
Walking down the steps and into
the bar we realised we were pretty
much the first people there, apart
from the DJ and his guests, and
so took the opportunity to have a
proper nosey around. Everywhere
was empty and the rooms looked
tiny with no-one in them. Still, this
was a good chance to get served
quickly at the bar and then sit down
for lots of chatting to randoms and
people-watching. Did I mention
that the people at Turnmills are
exceptionally friendly?
The only gripe I have ever had
with the place is that they insist on
never displaying set lists, so you
have no idea who is playing or when
to expect them. It seems like a minor
point, but in an age of faceless DJs
it’s hard to know who you are listen-
ing to and so who to look out for in
the future. If you are reading this Mr
Stix, can you do something about it?
Just a sheet on the door to the DJ
booth would be fine. Thanks!
So, I don’t know who was playing for
the first couple of hours I was there,
but they were good. Chunky, techy
house with a sprinkling of (deep
breath) prog, it was great for wind-
ing up to, and they played Sabotage
by the Beastie Boys – more brownie
points to Turnmills.
After that, I think Corvin Dalek
played, followed by Tall Paul and
John ‘00’ Fleming, and then I assume
Gavyn Mitchell, mainly because
the last few times I’ve been to the
Gallery, Gavyn has played the final
set of the night. Corvin and Paul may
have been the other way around, I
don’t know for sure. Whatever hap-
pened though, it was all good.
There were quite a few hours of
uplifting house music to start with.
I don’t really know my tunes or sub-
genres so I can’t expand further,
but I did hear a wicked remix of
Delerium’s Silence, and Cohen vs
Deluxe’s Just Kick! The rest was
fun, but a complete mystery to me.
At around 4am, John Fleming
came on. I’m pretty sure it was him
because all of sudden things were
trancey – I do know trance, and John
plays trance. It wasn’t your usual
uplifting“’CrasherTrance”©though,
it had a much darker, underground,
tribal feel to it. I would use the word
progressive if I wasn’t so scared of
it and its connotations. Despite this,
his set went down extremely well, as
in fact did all the others, and since
by now there was much more space
on the dance floor, everybody spent a
good two hours jumping around with
their arms in the air.
I should also mention at this point
that while all this was going on in
the main room, things got utter-
ly funked up in the second room.
Tonight, Sarah Main (Pacha’s star in
Ibiza) was the big cheese in charge
of the floor, and the back room of the
Gallery is now just as big a pull as
the main room acts themselves. Nic
Fanciulli has seen his popularity sky-
rocket in recent times thanks to his
back room residency with Fandango
and, in fact, the incredible sound sys-
tem in the back room is there thanks
to him. There is also the room at the
far end of the club which serves as
a chillout area with live acts, DJ’s,
ambient techno and plenty of ran-
doms to talk to.
And so to the final set of the night,
which in my experience is usually
one of the best. Much, much room
to dance thanks to the lightweights
going home, and a nice big chunk
of driving hard trance to give you
that final rush of energy, before
you have to stumble onto the tube.
Unfortunately, and to my eternal
shame, I didn’t make it past 6.30am
this time (I’m out of practise), but
the first half hour of the last guy’s
set was promising. Heavy and beat
driven, large techno undercur-
rents with sprinklings of euphoria,
quiet bits, loud bits, fast bits, slow
bits (mostly fast bits) and plenty of
opportunities to enliven those danc-
ing shoes that you thought would be
leaden by now.
All in all, another fantastic night
out at Turnmills – friendly faces,
great music, hilarious chats. Totally
reliable without being predictable,
and all for a bargain £10 before
11.30pm.

The clocks have changed, the
nights are drawing in, and it’s dark
most days before you get home.
Depressing, isn’t it? Well before
you all run off to the Health Centre
with suspected Seasonal Affective
Disorder, hear me out and I’ll show
you that it is in fact the season to
be jolly, especially where nightlife is
concerned.
OK, I concede that London gets
bloody cold this time of year, and
the thought of trekking around the
city in the silly hours might not
sound like much fun. Forget that. As
the days get shorter, the nights get
longer. It’s now possible to go out in
the dark, stay up partying all night,
and crawl home next morning, with-
out ever seeing the sun. Fantastic
for the more photosensitive of us
– when you finally get chucked out
with eyes like saucers after a night
of staggering around in the dark, it’s
a lot less harsh if the sun’s not up
yet. And it’s pretty hard to pull off
wearing shades in November.
Another thing to be thinking about
at this time of year is Christmas.
With no College to get in the way of
your hedonism, why not try out some
clubs that you otherwise couldn’t?
Afterparties and weeknights are the
best places to meet interesting peo-
ple, so get on out there!
Don’t forget though, that one of
the biggest (or at least most hyped)
nights of the clubbing calendar is
drawing steadily closer – New Year’s
Eve. If you’re planning to be in town
for NYE, there’ll be no shortage of
choice. Clubs charge multiples of
their normal entrance tariff and in
return promise you the best way to
watch the number at the end of the
date go up by one. It may seem a
while away, but the best events sell
out quickly, so look out for a roundup
of the NYE offerings accross the
capital in Felix soon.
