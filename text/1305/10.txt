On Saturday 30 October,
the Imperial College Union
Shotokan Karate Club
(ICUSKC) was honoured to
have a masterclass taught
by one of the greatest living
martial artists, Sensei Keigo
Abe. He is a world famous
karate expert and the Chief
Instructor of our affiliated
Japanese organisation. As
our special guest, he taught
for three hours, and everyone
from beginners to black belts
learned a lot from his wisdom
and authority and also had a
great time.
Sensei Abe started learn-
ing karate in Japan when he
was 15 years old. He stud-
ied under the most respect-
ed instructors and went on
to win many of the biggest
national and international
competition titles. By the
1990s, he had been appointed
the Technical Director of the
Japan Karate Association
(JKA), the original and most
important Shotokan karate
organisation.
He is now 66 years old and
holds 8th dan, one of the
highest possible ranks in
Shotokan karate. This visit to
England was planned around
teaching just two classes, one
of those at our club. We were
therefore obviously keen to
make the best impression we
could.
While everyone was wait-
ing to start, we were all very
anxious to see what the class
would be like. The club’s
new beginners in particular
didn’t know what to expect
and maybe started wondering
what they had let themselves
in for!
Sensei Abe started the les-
son after he was welcomed
and introduced to us by our
instructor Sensei Jim Lewis.
He ran the lesson in a tradi-
tional Japanese style, even
teaching solely in Japanese,
with one of our black belts
providing translation. Huge
thanks to Sanae for doing a
brilliant job!
At the start, some of the
club’s beginners seemed to
be hiding at the back of the
class, but they bravely moved
to the front once they were
spotted. Some people may
have been slightly scared, but
they needn’t have worried.
Sensei Abe is a great teacher
for all levels and helped each
of the beginners individually,
and gradually revealed that
his English is much better
than he first let on.
The lesson focused on
just the basic techniques of
karate, yet Sensei Abe’s very
clear explanations gave a
new insight into how the vari-
ous blocks, strikes and kicks
work, and why.
Some new members had
only been to a couple of les-
sons before, but they kept up
with the rest of the club bril-
liantly. Some even learnt up
to five completely new tech-
niques all in one session!
Throughout the lesson,
we were all in awe of Sensei
Abe’s technique. His style
was not as flashy as some
demonstrations, but you could
see the skill in his speed and
strength, and his technique
appeared perfect. He inspired
everyone in the room to try
their hardest throughout the
whole lesson.
After the main lesson was
an extra hour-long advanced
class for brown and black
belts. Sensei Abe focused on
advanced techniques and
some interesting new appli-
cations of the basics. We prac-
tised delivering each move in
the fastest, most natural and
practical ways possible. This
training has to be my person-
al highlight of the course.
This extra session also
included studying two high
level kata: set sequences of
blocks, strikes and turns that
are the traditional method of
learning karate. A lot of the
brown belts had never had
the chance to even try these
kata before, so it was diffi-
cult to keep up with the black
belts. Even so, it was a lot of
fun to try the more spectacu-
lar moves!
AlsoatthecoursewasSensei
Sidoli 7th dan, the President
of our British organisation.
When the advanced lesson
started, he volunteered to
stay and teach the beginners
the first kata in what became
a much more informal ses-
sion. Sensei Sidoli was very
encouraging and the begin-
ners loved the opportunity to
ask all their questions without
feeling self-conscious.
Over the whole course, eve-
ryone enjoyed themselves
immensely and learned even
more about karate, thanks to
excellent teaching that shone
through the translation.
Sensei Abe’s unique style and
gentlenaturewonhimaround
of applause and a lot of praise
at the end of the lesson. He
passed on some of his karate
secrets to our club members,
and we benefited from a truly
enlightening experience.
Of course, after three hours
of training, we then took some
badly needed refreshments in
the bar!
If you might be interested
in karate, it’s certainly not
too late to try. Beginners
are always welcome, and
we still have new members
starting each lesson. If you’d

All lessons at our club
are taught by Sensei Lewis
7th dan, one of the highest
ranked karate instructors in
the country, with a highly dis-
tinguished karate career and
a lot of experience. We are
very lucky to have such a high
ranked instructor, not just
because of his teaching, but
also because his reputation
brings the best in the world to
visit our club. Later this year
there will be the chance to
train with another Japanese
master, Sensei Mikio Yahara
8th dan.
ICUSKC has three train-
ing sessions each week in
the Union gym: Monday 6-
8pm, Thursday 8.30-10pm and
Saturday 10am-12noon.
To get started, simply come
along to one of our sessions
and start learning the art of
Shotokan karate. If you have
any questions, you can email

Boots, rucksacks, manic

wine cartons – yes, it must be
the Fellwanderers again.
It was Friday 29 October and
our 12 heroes crammed them-
selves into a gleaming yel-
low minibus for a seven hour
journey to the Lake District
(that’s the sticky-out bit just
south of Scotland, before
anyone asks). After a brief
detour across what felt like
half of Lancashire, we finally
arrived at two in the morning,
unloaded a mountain of kit
into a barn, mastered the gas-
powered space heater wos-
sname and crawled into our
sleeping bags... just in time to
be up again to climb Scafell
Pike, the highest mountain
in England at 987m (which
might not sound like much,
but when you’re standing at
the bottom looking up it’s an
awful long way to the top!)
Anyway, up we went, to
be rewarded with fabulous
views of the surrounding
national park and not-quite-
so-fabulous views of Sellafield
nuclear power station as a
malevolent white blob on the
horizon (remind me again
why they had to build it in one
of the most beautiful parts of
Britain? Still, that explains
why the local sheep glow in
the dark I guess).
After a quick chocolate stop
on the summit and a quick
lesson from El Presidente
(Sarah) on the etiquette of
dislodging rocks onto peo-
ple’s heads (it’s quite alright
as long as you shout some-
thing, apparently), we were
off again, scrambling onto a
ridge to the north and bag-
ging several smaller peaks
before looping back to
Wastwater where the minibus
had been strategically posi-
tioned by Andy next to the
pub. Surprising how drinking
real ale against a backdrop of
a flawless sunset can remind
you that London isn’t the be-
all and end-all!
Then it was back to the
barn for the aforementioned
vegetarian curry, featuring
the intriguing combination of
cashew nuts and cheese. After
the washing up had been sub-
dued, it was time to break
out the vino and play a few
rounds of Werewolf, a bizarre
and challenging game which
(eventually) involved Cupid, a
wooden spoon, an evil village
mayor, and... er...werewolves.
Enough said, I think.
Sunday morning was a bit
murkier than the previous,
so we decided to catch the
Ravenglass-Eskdale steam
railway into the hills and then
walk back to the coast and
the minibus along Muncaster
Fell, a gentle unchallenging
walk which allowed some
good navigation practice
along with a brief debate on
whether sheep should be
marked on maps or not.
Then finally there was the
ten hour return journey, skil-
fully planned to allow the
overseas Wanderers a good
view of spaghetti junction.
All in all, a fantastic weekend
– roll on the next one!
