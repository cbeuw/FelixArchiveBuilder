Last week saw Wye’s annual
Charity Week, a week of mad-
ness all in the name of Charity,
in a similar spirit to Imperial’s
RAG Week but with our own
distinctive traditions.
Sunday night was the
Halloween Launch Party,
and also saw the release of
the RAG Mag, featuring silly
quotes, pathetic chat-up lines
and such coveted awards as
‘Most Alcoholic Fresher’.
The drinking clubs’ costumes
for the week were revealed
too, with Robin Hood Beaus,
Cheerleader Garters and
Thunderbirds JSF.
Monday night was an
International Culture Night,
hosted by the Overseas
Students Organisation, and
saw the Union packed out
with home and overseas stu-
dents alike.
However, Tuesday morning
saw a most definite return
to Wye’s traditional RAG cal-
endar, with the Champagne
Breakfast. This year, when
students gathered in full black
tie dress, it turned out that the
coaches were taking them to
Planet Laser in Canterbury,
where they found out the hard
way what two laser games,
interspersed with two bottles
of fizzy wine each, and fry-
up sandwiches thrown in, can
do to the digestion. However,
this did not deter them from
supporting at least two of the
village pubs in between their
return and the opening of the
Union bar that evening for DJ
Benjy’s ‘Shake Down’ urban
music night.
Wednesday was scheduled
as the Druids’ Disco, but a
problem with their intend-
ed venue meant this had to
be cancelled at less than a
day’s notice. However, their
rival clubs were keen to step
in, and by 7.30 that evening
the JSF had organised a
Scavenger Hunt, which some-
how (miraculously) seems to
have stayed on the right side
of the law, with such catego-
ries as ‘a barmaid’s phone
number’, ‘a receipt for Baileys
and Lime’, “something green
and gold’ and ‘another team’s
underwear’.
Embarrassingly, the JSF
team themselves came joint
last with the Garters (amidst
many accusations of score-
fixing), and even more embar-
rassingly (but also more pre-
dictably) lost the tie-breaker
yard-downing race. However,
their careful planning did
result in many items being
‘borrowed’ ready for the next
day’s auction.
Thursday night was the cus-
tomary Slave Auction. In fact,
the slaves only constituted
the last four lots (four pairs
of freshers, two male and
two female); the rest of the
lots were items of students’
property ‘borrowed’ at vari-
ous points, including favour-
ite clothing, computer disks,
car keys, number plates... in
short, anything that had not
been nailed down that week,
and a few things that had
been.
Friday was the Charity
Week Ball, with a James Bond
theme. The Union bar and
dancefloor were draped in
black and white and decorat-
ed with a multitude of sparkly
things; the Agents wore their
tuxes, the Bond Girls wore
their cocktail dresses, the Old
Boys were back in force and
the drinks were flowing.
This would usually mark the
end of the week. However, due
to the way the dates worked
out this year, the Bonfire Party
that usually opens the week
on the first Saturday was held
on the final Saturday instead.
The traditional torchlight pro-
cession up to the crown was
as large as any recent year,
with torches, food and glow
sticks all selling out more rap-
idly than anyone could have
predicted.
Following an impressive
fireworks display, the stu-
dents (old and new) returned
to the Union bar for one last
chance to drink in the name
of Charity, and to count up
their takings for the week.
The final count has yet to be
completed, but the figure so
far stands at just over £1050
and so, considering our stu-
dent body numbers just a few
hundred, the gauntlet has
most definitely been thrown
down for the rest of Imperial’s
RAG efforts.

One of the advantages of liv-
ing in the middle of nowhere
is the ability to have parties
like this with (relative to the
other city campuses) few
health and safety concerns.
The carefully chosen site
for the bonfire, Silwood bot-
tom, has very little to set fire
to, with the exception of our
humungous bonfire and of
course the traditional guy.
An annual event out here,
there is nothing quite like it
(except maybe Lewes). No
fireworks unfortunately, but
with open grounds in true
student style we are able
to watch the big explosions
around us. The groundsmen
here collect fuel for the fire all
week, and traditionally first
year PhD students spend
Friday building it.
Then, with a pint in hand,
males are drawn from all over
the site to the prospect of fire
like wasps to beer. Like the
primitive Neanderthal man,
they then stand around grunt-
ing, wondering how to get
this extravaganza underway.
Unwilling to siphon petrol off
a nearby unclaimed car, they
resort to toilet roll and blow-
ing. It is rather amusing to
watch a group of eight male
Homo habilis trying to start
a twelve foot high bonfire by
blowing on it.
Due to the wet summer and
recent weather experienced,
it didn’t go up as quickly as
expected, prolonging the
enjoyment that is watching
fire, an unexplainable phe-
nomenon. Maybe it’s the ele-
ment of danger or the respect
we have for it. Like the pri-
mate cave people, it means a
huge advancement in civilisa-
tion – no more raw Silwood
deer, we can spit roast them
now!
Three hours after starting,
the feast began with roast-
ing chestnuts. It was made
clear that they were collected
locally and the Union held
no responsibility for illness
incurred or bugs found with-
in. Groups of hunter gatherer
Homo erectus spread out in
search of some way of cook-
ing them on the now burning
inferno, returning later with
a borrowed shovel (resource
reallocation is a transferable
skill that my PhD has taught
me well). A little hard to start
with, they got better as the
night proceeded... or was it
the increase in blood alcohol
level? Kindly provided black
peas (a northern delicacy,
apparently) with salt and vin-
egar as well as treacle toffee
concluded the balanced diet
of the night.
Frustrated at not having
our own fireworks, a cunning
idea was forged to throw piles
of leaves on the fire sending
red hot ashes high into the
cloudless country sky. Who
needs roman candles when
you have these for free?
The evolution of man was
completed with a survivors’
breakfast and the promise of
bacon and eggs. Arguably one
of Homo sapiens’ greatest
advancements is agriculture,
the concentrated growing and
breeding of food. This was put
to good use with the break-
fast, and with it, the evolution
of mankind was completed in
one night.
