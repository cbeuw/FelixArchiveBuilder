“They had a principle where
MRSA patients were put on
special wards, but they were
all full. After she was readmit-
ted, she deteriorated over the
next three days, and died of
septicemia.”
The lamentation of a man
who lost his wife to the hospi-
tal superbug. Bereavements
such as these have become
unfortunately commonplace
in the modern hospital envi-
ronment. As the NHS is faced
with a crisis over this appar-
ent epidemic, are hospitals
and the government doing
enough to help prevent the
spread of the pathogen?
This week, about 15 people
will die as a direct result of
infection by MRSA, a deadly
bacterium that has developed
substantial resistance to
many of the different antibiot-
ics used on hospital wards. In
total, 800 people a year die of
MRSA, and this only forms a
fraction of the total number
of deaths related to bacterial
infections contracted in hos-
pitals. The title MRSA stands
for “Mythically Resistant
Staphylococcus Aurous”, and
is a term used to describe
a variety of bacteria of the
Staphylococcus Aurous fam-
ily that have developed this
form of resistance.
The bacteria are found
in as much as 30% of the
population, usually within the
nasal passage or on the skin
of carriers. They are usually
harmless when carried in this
way; infection occurs usually
when the bacteria penetrate
beneath the skin, for example
via a wound. That explains
why many of those who devel-
op the symptoms of the infec-
tion are those who have had
some form of surgery. Once
inside the body, the bacteria
can reproduce at a staggering
rate, rapidly releasing toxins
which can lead to devastating
conditions such as blood poi-
soning and pneumonia.
In the past, the bacteria
have evolved their resistance
to many of the antibiotics used
in hospitals due to the high
mutation rate of their genes
and the misuse of said antibi-
otics. Suppose that there are
1000 Staphylococcus Aureas
in a tissue. The antibiotic
methicillin may be used and
it would kill 999 of them. Yet if
the course of antibiotics was
abandoned early – as is often
the case due to the laziness of
the patient who fails to take
his prescription – the one
that survives may have devel-
oped resistance to the drug.
This development would be
due to the mutation of one
or more of its genes, which
would, as if by accident, con-
vey the necessary resistance.
Bacteria have evolved, how-
ever, to have genes with high
mutation frequencies in order
to give them a competitive
advantage against immune
systems and, more recently,
antibiotics. The one that is
left would reproduce rapidly,
leading to a population of the
bacteria that would carry
resistance to the antibiotic.
Therefore, and perhaps
ironically, it is due to the
development of our own extra
defence mechanisms against
these bacteria that we have
selectively cultured a fam-
ily of pathogenic organisms
which we are almost power-
less to inhibit. Furthermore, it
is in our hospitals that these
organisms are at their most
rampant. In an environment
where there is a multitude
of already weak and ill host
organisms, ie patients, the
bacteria can easily reproduce
with relative ease.
In addition to this, it appears
that many of our hospitals are
making it even easier for this
organism to exist, through
simple incompetence and the
failure to recognize the full-
ness of the threat posed by
these superbugs.
In a recent survey of five
of London’s most prominent
hospitals, undertaken by an
independent scientist called
Dr Malyszewicz, appallingly
unhygienic conditions have
allowed the MRSA bacteria
to propagate to dangerously
high levels.
The levels of the bacteria
were measured using culture
techniques. Samples were
taken from various different
areasofthehospital,forexam-
ple work surfaces and hand-
rails. These samples were
then incubated, allowing any
bacteria present to grow into
colonies. The density of these
colonies was then measured.
The ‘maximum safe level’ of
the bacteria is 0.5 colonies
per square centimetre. This
level is considered as being
the threshold between safe
and dangerously high levels
of the bacteria.
The results were alarming.
In North Middlesex Hospital,
Edmonton, and St Mary’s
Hospital, Paddington, the
level of the colonies was, at
worst, 20 colonies per square
centimetre, 40 times higher
than the maximum safe level.
Dr Malyszewicz was scath-
ing of all the hospitals he
surveyed, complaining about
basic hygiene and work sur-
faces that had not been prop-
erly washed in over 48 hours
and, if they had been washed,
they had been washed with
detergents that had no effect
on the bacteria.
AllthisaftertheGovernment
has poured £1bn into the NHS
specifically to combat the
spread of these killer bugs
through our hospitals. Some
say that the Government
is not doing enough, and,
although I am inclined to
agree with them, I would also
say that the Government can-
not necessarily account for
the failure of its staff to wash
their hands properly. That is
a problem which, I believe,
must be addressed at ward
level. Better and safer poli-
cies must be introduced to
make sure that simple meas-
ures are undertaken with
greater enthusiasm.
There can be no complaint
with the levels of funding; it
is up to hospital and ward
managers to implement
these funds to better effect.
The hiring of more cleaners
is one approach which I feel
is fairly obvious. Furthermore
I would argue that cam-
paigns to staff that promote
the idea that extreme care
must be taken with respect
to hygiene should be intro-
duced. The simple things
– washing hands and work-
tops diligently and repeatedly
every day – could constitute a
major weapon against these
organisms.
Many experts believe that
MRSA and related bacteria
cannot be wiped out. There
will always be a residual
population in a hospital ward.
Indeed, how can bacteria
that reside in the nasal pas-
sage of 30% of the popula-
tion be completely overcome?
Yet this level can be a level
whereby the risk of infection
is minimised. At the moment,
it would appear that not
enough is being done to limit
the levels of these bacteria in
hospitals.
Are we placing patients at
further risk unnecessarily? I
wonder if the families of the
800 people killed each year by
MRSA believe their bereave-
ment was avoidable.
Nevertheless, it is still the
ultimate responsibility of the
Government to initiate the
measures that will reduce
the incidence of MRSA relat-
ed deaths. The rise in the
number of deaths from 51 in
1993 to 800 in 2002 indicates
that, still, not enough is being
done. This number could
even be substantially greater
than admitted, as it is not a
demand of doctors to fill in
MRSA as a cause of death on
death certificates.
The development of a vac-
cine is already well underway,
and it is rapidly becoming a
tangible prospect. Although
in the UK the vaccine is
still quite embryonic in its
progress, and involves killing
the bacteria when they are
still on the skin of the car-
rier, in the US a vaccine that
attacks the bacteria when
they have penetrated the
body is being created.
This is a more conventional
vaccine and would ultimate-
ly provide the best hope for
defence against the disease.
Yet a potentially farcical situ-
ation may occur whereby the
manufacture of a success-
ful vaccine would have to be
privately funded, rather than
funded by the Government.
In this case, I for one
would be critical of current
Government policy and would
hope for its alteration.
This refusal to acknowledge
the true magnitude of the
problem may be clouding the
issue and averting the pub-
lic’s attention from the full
extent of the truth.
The truth is that too many
people are dying of avoidable
infections for us to continue
to turn a blind eye. Measures
must be taken immediately
to halt the advance of these
bacteria, or else we run the
risk of developing a bug
which could be immune to all
antibiotics we currently have.
In the eternal war against
disease, this would constitute
a major, and potentially ruin-
ous, defeat.
The truth about the MRSA epidemic
Today’s hospitals are not so much places of healing as deathtraps for the sick. William
Gates looks at the extent of the problem and argues that much more must be done

Obesity costs airlines £200 million a year and other stories
By Darius Nikbin
Science Editor
I was surprised by some of
the news stories this week.
Not only did doctors in India
have to treat a man for acci-
dentally swallowing a tooth-
brush, but also an F16 fighter
jet opened fire on a school
in New Jersey, a 38 year-old
Japanese woman choked to
death during a ‘bread eat-
ing’ competition, and a ticket
inspector in York stamped a
man’s ticket without realising
the passenger was dead.
Another story which bor-
ders on the farcical shows
how the obesity epidemic,
afflicting much of the devel-
oped world, is having some
unlikely consequences.
A study in the American
Journal of Preventative
Medicine showed that the
extra weight due to ‘larger-
than-life’ people caused air-
lines to spend $280 million to
burn 1.3 billion more litres
of fuel in 2000, just to carry
the additional weight of fat
Americans.
This means that a signifi-
cant proportion of the cost of
your Ryanair ticket to Ibiza,
or wherever else Imperial
students take their holidays,
is probably being spent to
subsidise ‘larger-than-life’
people. Bear that in mind
next time you fly.
Of course, it would be an
exaggeration to say that this
increases the cost of flying
by a massive margin. In fact,
it probably doesn’t affect the
cost of flying around Europe
by much, at all. Which begs
the question, what am I talk-
ing about?
In truth, these stories are
completely trivial compared
to the coalition’s (what a
misnomer that is) attack on
Fallujah, or, for instance, the
ongoing MRSA epidemic.
Reading Will Gates’ arti-
cle this week will leave you
with a sense of complete
disbelief. It is amazing how
often the Government has
not done anything until it is
faced with crisis. This same
thing happened with the BSE
and foot-and-mouth crises.
The reason for this is that
scientific advice is simply not
being heeded. Governmental
policy is being moulded by
the fleeting force of pub-
lic perception, so that the
underlying problems are
allowed to develop until it is
too late.
This week you can also
read about a student who
spent the summer studying
abroad. As an Alumnus of the
ERASMUS scheme I would
recommend studying abroad
to anyone. Ben King’s article
will give you a good idea of
what it’s like.
