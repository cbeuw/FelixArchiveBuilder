Imperial College appears in
14th place in a new list of the
best universities in the world.
Harvard University, in
Massachusetts, took first
place by a considerable mar-
gin. Seven of the top ten
institutions in the list are
American.
In the global rankings, com-
piled by The Times Higher
Education Supplement and
published last week, univer-
sities were placed in a table
with points given for these
key factors: findings from a
survey of 1300 academics in 88
countries, the amount of cited
research produced by faculty
members, the ratio of staff to
students, and a university’s
success in attracting foreign
students and internationally
renowned academics.
Imperial is ranked fourth
among UK universities,
behind Oxford, Cambridge
and the London School of
Economics. The only other
European university in the top
20 is ETH Zurich, Switzerland,
in tenth place.
Mustafa Arif, President
of Imperial College Union,
stressed the importance of
the College’s presence in
the world’s top 15 and com-
mented: “It’s a good thing for
Imperial students, when they
graduate, to have the value of
their degrees recognised by
employers across the world”.
“However, there is a lot
of work to be done to catch
up with the American insti-
tutions, particularly given
the resources they put into
teaching.”

“The next four years of Bush’s
presidency will effectively
determine the state of the
world’s economy, but whether
that is a good thing or not is
anybody’s guess.”

“As the days get shorter, the
nights get longer. It’s now
possible to go out, stay up
partying all night, and crawl
home the next morning, with-
out ever seeing the sun.”

Imperial College’s Institute of
Biomedical Engineering has
been given £3.4m by Advance
Nanotech, an American
nanotechnology company, to
help develop the next genera-
tion of medical technology.
Nanotechnology is defined
as ‘any fabrication technology
in which objects are designed
and built by the specifica-
tion and placement of indi-
vidual atoms or molecules or
where at least one dimension
is on a scale of nanometres
(10–9
m)’.
Professor Chris Toumazou,
Director of the Institute, said:
“Given Imperial’s excellence
in medicine and technology,
we are ideally positioned to
push forward the barriers
of this new field of science.
This collaboration will ena-
ble us to focus on combining
nanotechnology with other
powerful technologies such
as tissue engineering to
make breakthroughs of great
social and commercial sig-
nificance.
“The application of nanote-
chnology to medicine... opens
up new possibilities for diag-
nosing, preventing and treat-
ing disease and traumatic
injury.”
The Institute of Biomedical
Engineering focuses on
interdisciplinary research in
emerging technologies for
human health and wellbeing.
£3.4m for nanotechnology at Imperial
College to
develop
vaccines
against
biological
weapons
Scientists at Imperial College
are to help develop new vac-
cines in case of attacks by
terrorists using biological
weapons.
A team from Imperial
College and Hammersmith
Hospital has been award-
ed $4.5m by the National
Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, part of
the US National Institute of
Health, to work on the vac-
cines against possible attacks
and new infectious diseases.
They will use state of the art
technologies to develop new
diagnostics and treatments
for anthrax.
Dr Danny Altmann, lead
researcher, said: “Despite
many of the current possible
bio-weapons having existed
for many years, we only have
a limited defence against
them. With the increased
threat of terrorism and bio-
terrorism, it is vital that
we develop a much greater
understanding of these bio-
logical agents including
anthrax. This programme
will allow us to develop more
effective measures to protect
the population in the event of
an attack.
“At the same time, the
research will also be of
huge benefit in under-
standing new and emerging
infectious diseases, whilst
we carry out fundamental
research into immunology.
This fundamental research
will also help to develop
much more effective diag-
nostics and treatment which
can be used for a variety of
diseases.”
