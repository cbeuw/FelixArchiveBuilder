You thought the last movie was hap-
pily ever after? You thought wrong!
As with the first film, The Edge
of Reason is based on the novel by
Helen Fielding organised as a diary
by Bridget, a London-based ‘single-
ton’ and (high-flying) journalist with
an often disastrous social life and
an unfortunate capacity for alcohol,
cigarettes and calories.
The story picks up four weeks
after the first film ended, and we find
Bridget (Renée Zellweger) where
we left her, blissful and besotted in
the arms of her gorgeous lawyer
Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).
However, after six weeks the
cracks are starting to show and she
finds his habit of folding underpants
simply too hard to bear. Are his
upper-class background and school-
ing at Eton, which she describes
as “a fascist institution where they
stick a poker up your arse and
you’re not allowed to remove it for
the rest of your life” going to drive
them apart?
Bridget’s petty jealousies are also
starting to get the better of her, and
their relationship. Among these is
her suspicion about Mark’s long-
legged intern, who, on top of being
super-slim, has a knack for doing
everything right. Cue Bridget’s
former boss, womanizing heart-
throb Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant),
undergoing sex therapy, but has he
really changed?
So Bridget is back to that same
question: Mark Darcy or Daniel
Cleaver? And what could be better
than having those two fighting over
you?
We also see the return of chain-
smoking, ever caring, crazy single-
ton friends who are always on hand
to offer relationship advice, but
should she listen to them?
This is a story that travels from
the streets of London to the slopes of
the Alps and the shores of Thailand
– and finds Bridget skydiving (or
falling), skiing (sort of) and finding
herself in a few unfortunate cir-
cumstances. Ms Jones flies from
embarrassing situation to romantic
misunderstanding, still managing to
muddle through in this continuation
of the trials and tribulations of the
single working woman.
If you liked Bridget Jones’ Diary,
three years was well worth the
wait to see this next installment
of Bridget’s disaster-strewn adven-
tures. Unlike many sequels, this ulti-
mate chick flick managed to exceed
our expectations and keep us capti-
vated throughout.
Despite using some of the same
gags as the first film, we see Bridget
and company extend the boundaries
of their London base to explore plac-
es further afield, with new delights
of Thai girls, boys and magic mush-
rooms. The soundtrack is impres-
sive and if Hugh Grant and Colin
Firth are not enough, we also see
an appearance of the lovely Paul
Nicholls!
Again, we see the cast work well
together. Zellweger, having inflicted
her body with an alarming weight
gain for a second time, remasters
both a British accent and the skil-
ful physical comedy that sees her
negotiate the Annual Law Dinner in
a skintight gold dress – not her most
flattering moment!
Those of you with the Y chromo-
some may have been dreading the
release of this film, but if you are
dragged along, you will be pleas-
antly surprised and we guarantee
it will put a smile on your face!
For us fairer sex, this is the ulti-
mate feel-good film and perfect for a
great girls’ night out. It is a comfort
to all women, single and attached,
that even dating Mark Darcy has its
downfalls.
The light-hearted storyline had us
in stitches from the opening scene
of Bridget’s sky-dive into pig excre-
ment to the second round of Darcy
vs Cleaver, which takes place in our
very own Hyde Park (if only we’d
been there).

The blind leading the blind
Bad Santa, good movie
Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) has to
be the worst Santa Claus ever. He
vomits on alley walls, swears at the
children, pisses himself and comes
into work drunk.
The odd thing about this Santa
Claus is his lack of Christmas spirit,
and the fact that he’s also a con-
man, robbing each department
store on each Christmas Eve, with
a small dwarf (Tony Stark) as an
accomplice. This strategy becomes
complicated, however, when Willie
meets a bizarre eight-year-old child
(Brett Kelly) who he exploits when
he needs a place to stay. As the days
go by, Willie seems to care more
and more for The Kid, and The Kid
teaches Willie the real meaning of
Christmas.
Every character in this blackest
of black comedies was funny, quirky
and strange: three words that also
describe the film. Bad Santa does
its own thing and is one of a kind.
Each performer took hold of their
role naturally and comfortably, with
exception of The Kid, whose awk-
wardness was purposeful.
Willie exudes bad behaviour and
foul language. He’s a sad pathetic
loser, and Billy Bob Thornton is
excellent in this role. He looks mal-
nourished – the smallest, dirtiest
Santa Claus ever seen. His hound
dog looks emanate how unhappy
he is with life. Thornton shows yet
another example of his versatility
in this film, along with his previ-
ous roles as Jacob Mitchell in A
Simple Plan or Hank Grotowski in
Monster’s Ball.
The Kid is an oddball. Willie and
The Kid make the mildest connec-
tion at first, which grows slightly
throughout the film. It is unlike any
other predictable “bad man turns
good” film in this way, because even
though Willie learns to care for The
Kid, he is still a rude, crude drunk
and a bad man.
Not one character in this film is an
average Joe or normal in any way,
including the Jewish barmaid with a
Santa fetish. This film has the most
unusual and out of the ordinary plot,
which gives it originality and is one
reason above all to like the movie.
The Kid’s incongruity is the key
to producing comic value here.
That is why this movie will offend.
Most of the jokes are targeted at the
strange, overly large child. In a way,
it just doesn’t seem right to laugh at
it, or at Willie’s pathetic existence.
Tony Cox steals the show though
as the devilish vulgar midget, with
comical white elf ears.
The film is full of swearing, a small
amount of nudity, lots of suggestive
sexual acts and violence. Beating up
a young boy is one of Willie’s wildest
moments.
That said, I couldn’t help but
laugh. This film was harsh but hilar-
ious, the script was comedy. I would
watch it again.

Does Willie like children?
