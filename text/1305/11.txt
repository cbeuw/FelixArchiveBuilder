Freshers trip 2004
By Jim Pullen
The Canoe Club’s fresh-
ers trip to Wales found a set
of well-organised newbies
packed and ready to go by
6.45am – a new club record
perhaps? Two minibuses
positively overflowing with
slightly worried looking fresh-
ers set off from the Union in
a formula one style starting
formation.
The journey up went with
little incident and we were
soon past Birmingham and
heading into the land of
sheep. Rain was pouring
down at this point and the
prospects of a great paddling
weekend were high. Loads of
cars laden with boats were
spotted, including an irritat-
ing little one containing four
blondes driving at 30mph and
causing a four-mile tailback.
The hut was reached a little
after midnight and drinking
ensued. Theo’s job as chief
fire-starter was usurped by
Lars and his scouting skills.
In no time, we had a roaring
fire, which Lars blocked up
with drying wood (oh well).
Most of the John Smiths was
consumed and then we head-
ed to bed at around 3am.
Saturday started with the
fry-up sandwich at the ridicu-
lously early time of 7am. We
left at 8.30 and arrived at the
lake above the Glaslyn. Some
interesting warm-up proce-
dures ensued, instigated by
Alice and Paula, much to
the amusement of the pass-
ing road-sweeper. We got on
the lake and got people used
to paddling on open water.
Apparently Nina had some-
how missed the opportunity
of a capsize drill in the pool,
but she soon made up for it
by quickly jumping out of her
boat and testing the water
temperature.
After a small amount of
faffing around, we split into
four groups and proceeded off
down the river. Water levels
were very high, with the pos-
sibility of paddling in fields if
one chose to take it. Normal
grade 1-2 became 2-3 and car-
nage soon ensued with mul-
tiple swims from a few of the
paddling newbies. The rapid
next to Beddgelert seemed to
cause the most swims.
Eventually we got the swim-
mers out of the water and the
boats were rescued further
downstream, much to the
amusement of the watching
grannies on the bridge.
Further swim-tastic fun
was had with much multi-col-
oured plastic floating through
Beddgelert. Once the first
three groups were down, we
got the minibus round and
started sorting things out.
Nick’s missing paddle was
located (he’d kindly lent it
out and was paddling with a
leftie), but there was no sign
of Rob’s group. After about an
hour, three fifths of them pad-
dled up, the other two having
walked out. Some discussion
was had as to what to do next
(it still being only 1.00) and we
eventually left for the Llugwy
with much minibus manoeu-
vring.
Both Plas-Y-Brenin and the
get-out were rammed with
paddlers, but we squeezed
the minibuses in somehow.
Unfortunately, Lars decided
to stand on the roof and help
unload the boats, apparently
not caring that the rear of his
club wetsuit had now failed
completely and exposed him-
self to passing traffic – the
mental scars are still healing.
We got on the water in similar
groups and did a short paddle
down a 1km stretch, practis-
ing ferry-gliding and break-
ing-in/out on the way down.
The section’s best rapid
occurred at the end, where a
friendly Aussie helped to fish
Caroline out.
After a little wait, the more
experienced paddlers went
on down to Cobden’s falls.
Rob set up safety with Ralph
and Theo bombing through
it to fish people out at the
bottom. I followed Mark and
Lars (this guy has no fear).
Lars swam on the chute
above the falls and I was
forced to take evasive action,
leaving Mark to fish him out.
I ran the falls OK, much to
my relief after my only other
attempt had gone so badly
wrong. I then got out to watch
the swim-madness occurring.
Lars and Mark had some-
how got themselves out on a
rock above the falls and were
getting back on (Lars after
his second swim, Mark after
scrambling out of his boat to
try and help). At this point
Claire’s inazone appeared
upside-down and found a nice
line down, with no sign of
Claire (who had swam to the
side further upstream).
A couple of drinks in the
pub were very much needed
at this point and some inter-
esting debates were had by
all. We got back to the hut and
ate large quantities of chilli
thanks to the dedication of the
chefs forsaking the pub. The
ancient tradition of climbing
the hut ladder was performed,
with yours truly being nomi-
nated to demonstrate by the
dreadlocked wussy one. All
the freshers completed the
challenge successfully, with
some interesting (and some-
what dodgy-looking) new
techniques invented by Rob.
At this point I must confess
to not being fully aware of
what was going on, but for
some reason most of the girls
removed their bras (I seem
to remember Rob putting one
on, but no surprise there).
Sunday morning started
with a few hardcore mem-
bers getting up to watch Theo
and Rob run the gorge. The
rest of us arose somewhat
later and got breakfast and
the hut sorted out. We left at
11 with some confusion as to
what river had been decided
on, how the name was spelt
and where it was. Eventually,
we gave up and went to the
lower Mawwdach. We divided
into similar groups to the day
before – without Peter (dodgy
shoulder), Nina (dodgy knee)
and Kai (dodgy cold) – and
got on the water.
The first rapid was a lit-
tle difficult for the newbies
and several swims resulted.
Whilst rescuing a boat and
swimmer, Ralph managed
to lose his rather expensive
paddles, resulting in a very
grumpy tree-hugging hippy.
He went back to the bus, got
some lefties and caught us
up. Several nice grade three
rapids were discovered (to
the complete surprise of Lars
in at least one case) and a
few more swims occurred.
Fortunately for Ralph, I spot-
ted his watersticks sitting in
an eddy about halfway down
the run. People were definite-
ly improving at this point as
they figured out that leaning
upstream = cold + wet.
Some confusion was had
as to where the get-out was,
with myself and Ralph going
for a quick jog to find the
minibus. Eventually, all four
groups ended up at the get-
out together. It was a seri-
ously steep mud and leaf
bank, and some interesting
rope techniques were used
which involved Rob and Chad
running headlong down the
bank (securely harnessed to
throw-lines obviously), whilst
a boat went bumping up it.
Finally the teamwork result-
ed in all the kit finding its way
successfully back in/on the
buses.
Getting changed by the
road proved amusing with a
lot of drivers taking a keen
interest in Claire (or possibly
Lars, we weren’t really sure
which was being hooted at).
We stopped for a quick fish
and chip break in Welshpool,
and some lead-footed action
from the drivers meant that
both buses made it back for
the last tube.

CANOE CLUB
Canoeists enjoy wet Welsh weekend
By Chris Jackson
RAG Chair
Many people have been ask-
ing me what RAG is up to this
year. So to save myself from
insanity by constantly saying
the same thing, here is a run-
down of the events that we
are currently planning:
Children in Need
The annual BBC appeal is
on 19 November and RAG is
joining in!
On the day we aim to launch
over 500 balloons from the
Queen’s Lawn. Buying one of
these balloons will cost you
a comparatively cheap £1.
The balloon that is found fur-
thest away and returned to
us will win a fantastic prize,
with further prizes for those
in second and third places,
and a prize for the location
with the strangest name (at
my discretion).
RAG raid
Saturday 27 November sees
an invasion of London from
several other university
RAGs. Not wanting to miss
out, we will be there and we
hope you will be too.
For all of you who want
to bring chaos to Central
London, this is your chance!
Boating in fountains, form-
ing a giant conga in Trafalgar
Square, tiddlywinking down
Oxford Street, streaking
through the Bank of England,
blagging free items whilst
doing market research in a
sex shop or anything else that
comes to mind – this is the
day to do it!
RAG Week 2005
RAG Week has been con-
firmed as 7-13 February next
year. All the usual fun and
games is planned: a raid
midweek, the Monopoly pub
crawl to end the week, plus
many more events yet to be
decided! If you have an event
in mind, then join us and
make it happen – just email
rag@ic.ac.uk.
Number time
Things have only just got
started, but we have some
cash coming in!
Freshers Week made
£98.42, and tins in the Union
shop have made a nice £54.45
from all your two pence coins.
The tins have been replaced
with empty ones, so keep giv-
ing us your coppers – it all
adds up! The cloakroom at
Commemoration Day made
£300 through the hard work
of a few volunteers, so many
thanks to all of them. Finally,
I would like to thank every-
one who contributed to RAG
via my tankard last week in
the Union Bar, even if I was
trying to drink from it at the
time. £3.13 does not improve
the taste of Abbot Ale but
might just improve the life
of someone with cancer or
AIDS.
RAG
RAG rundown (and some numbers)
Just one of the ways you can help RAG bring chaos to central London (and raise money at
the same time): a volunteer conducts some ‘market research’
