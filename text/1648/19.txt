DRUGS
The changing face of drug dealing
T
raditionally,
drugs have been
bought by ringing
up your friendly
neighbourhood
dealer. You would
agree a time and place to
meet, either some shady
alley or perhaps one of your
houses if you were actually
friends. Drugs would then be
transacted, for a probably
pre-determined price, with the
purchase method being cash.
There are several downsides
to this delivery method. Firstly,
if you’re not well acquainted
with this dealer there could
be issues with quality. If you
don’t know them well, and
they’re not counting on your
repeat business, they’re
much less likely to give you
the high-quality items you
crave. And, it’s not always

convenient to meet said
dealer. Especially when
your tasty pile of cocaine
is running dry at six o’clock
on a Tuesday morning, it’s
hardly likely they’ll be awake
and ready. Add into this the
improbability that your dealer
has a chip and pin machine,
and one can see why technol-
ogy might offer a new and
more exciting method of drug
collection.
Technology has recently
given us marvels such as
mobile phones, 3D printing
and electric cars. It has also
given us the dark web. The
dark web, for those unac-
quainted, is World Wide Web
content that is only accessible
when using special software
like the Tor browser, which
bounces communications
around a distributed network
of relays around the world,
making it difficult for some-
body watching your Internet
connection to learn what
sites you visit. As a result,
this prevents those crafty
police officers from tracking
who you’re messaging, what
porn you’re watching, and
what drugs you’re buying. It
is possible to buy anything
on the dark web, from your
mate’s Uber account details
to your mum’s phone number.
Tread carefully or your
friends will buy you a mail
order Thai bride. The system
is very similar to browsing
through Amazon for head-
phones. You can view the
best-selling cocaine products,
highest-rated MDMA, and so
on. You can even give feed-
back after purchasing your
drug (or other illegal item),
to ensure that other addicts
like yourself are aware of the
quality.
The first online dark web
marketplace was Silk Road.
Launched in February 2011,
it was operated by an
American whose real name
is uninteresting. However,
he often referred to himself
online as the much more
impressive ‘Dread Pirate
Roberts’. After a lengthy
investigation by the FBI,
Silk Road was shut down
in October 2013. But, you
know what they say: you can
never keep a good drug/arms
dealer down. As a result, Silk
Road 2.0 went live soon after,
before being taken down
once again by the sneaky
FBI. We are now on the third
iteration of Silk Road.
Competition is fierce in the
dark web market. Alphabay
is now the largest vendor, but
the number of sites available
grows regularly. With over 20
still alive to our knowledge,
the FBI are simply unable to
point their big Trump-shaped
weapons in the direction of
the problem. Governmental
departments cannot crush this
phenomenon without destroy-
ing the Internet.
The process of buying on
Alphabay is simple. First,
select the drug you want
and the desired amount you
require. Purchases are usually
made through Bitcoin (more
on that another time), an
online currency available for
purchase using conventional
money. This is to avoid the use
of debit/credit cards, another
form of accountability.
After this, the largest flaw in
the plan appears. The drugs
have to be sent somewhere,
thus lifting the veil on the
oh-so-sacred shadowy
nature of the dark web.
Despite this, upon filling out
the address you want your
drugs delivered to, a few
days later your order will
be delivered to your door.
How exciting! I know I have
already compared this pro-
cess to an Amazon shopping
experience, but it really is
remarkably similar.
Now at this point, some
of you may be asking such
questions as, “How is it at
all safe to order drugs to an
address?”, and “Surely it’s
obvious you’re going to get
caught?” Both valid questions
that I asked when I first heard
about the system. Well to
address the issue, I did some
‘investigation’, and found
some people who were test-
ing this method, purely for the
sake of curiosity, obviously.
This is what went down. A
quantity of marijuana was
ordered and after a few
days a box was delivered
to the house. Not just any
box though. A cellophane
wrapped Wi-Fi router box.
This was confusing at first;
the box was unwrapped and
after digging through layers
of tinfoil there was a vacuum
packed quantity of marijuana.
Fascinating. So not only was
the package vacuum sealed,
it was buried under a moun-
tain of aluminium, placed in a
deceptively labelled box and
then resealed in cellophane.
Naturally, the seller received
a five-star rating.
Technology appears to be
taking over every aspect of
our lives. If recent innovations
allow Amazon to brutalise
the British high street, there
appears no reason why
similar technologies cannot
do the same to those who sell
drugs. With the level of #inno-
vation relentless, it seems
there is no aspect of society
safe from the advancement
of the interconnected world.
Even, it seems, traditional
drug dealers.

Masturbation [mas-ter-bey-shuhn] :
Erotic stimulation, especially of one’s own genital organs commonly resulting in orgasm and
achieved by manual or other bodily contact exclusive of sexual intercourse, by instrumental
manipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies
Y
es, masturbation.
We all do it,
and those who
say they don’t
are probably
lying. Right?
Well, actually, maybe not.
The felix Sex Survey reveals
that year on year, about
10% of us never indulge in a
little self-pleasure, with that
number skewed by around
a quarter of the women who
never polish the pearl. So
maybe we’re not all choking
the chicken, but the question
really is, should we be?
Despite the age-old rhetoric
that wanking is bad for you,
will make hairs grow on the
palms of your hands, and will
make you go blind, jacking
and jilling off is actually good
for you. It’s known to relieve
stress, help you sleep, and is
even known to help prevent
prostate cancer. Are you
really that healthy if you’re
not giving the monkey a
healthy spank every once in
a while?
Masturbation is the best
way to get to know your body
and what you like, which
means that those who are
stroking the salami regularly
are likely to have better sex
too. After all, how are you
going to show the people
you’re having sex with what
you like if you don’t even
know yourself?
But wait, I hear you cry! I
(am one of the 58% of men,
and 72% of women at Impe-
rial that) have a partner – I
don’t need to masturbate! It’s
true that the topic of gilding
the lily can be a bit of a
sticky subject in a relation-
ship. Some people feel guilty
about getting off without their
partners, and some even go
so far as to consider it cheat-
ing (because those pesky
insecurities call for the thought
police). Certainly it’s a bit
awkward if your boyfriend is
working on a problem sheet
and you’re sat in the corner
rubbing one out, but with
appropriate boundaries,
cleaning the rifle can balance
out uneven sex drives and
provide some of the me-time
that us millennials forget so
often.
And moreso, we should
be talking about it. We’re
socialised to have such a high
level of shame about flicking
the bean, but it’s something
that almost everyone does.
Women tend to fall into
two categories: those who
vehemently deny that they
do it, and those who gather
in groups to swap Lovehoney
recommendations. Men are
more likely to acknowledge
it casually, but God forbid
they would have a serious
conversation about tossing the
turkey (festive! #BlackFriday).
But why is this? There’s a lot
of knowledge to be gained
from sharing your experience
with others, whether it’s
a recommendation for a
cheaper Hitachi alternative,
or a suggestion for how long
to microwave that melon for.
Being open with your friends
about jerking the gherkin
is a good step towards
being open with your sexual
partners, and that can only
improve your sex life.
So now we’ve established
that we should be doing the
five knuckle shuffle, let’s talk
about how, and how often.
From our felix archives, we
know that (unsurprisingly) the
men of Imperial are taking
the sausage hostage more
often than the women are
clubbing the clam, with most
men flipping the dolphin at
least a few times a week.
The girls are clearly busier,
with most only finding time
to double-click the mouse a
couple times a week. People
are all different, and as long
as you’re not breaking the
law and your bits aren’t sore
(unless that’s what you’re
into), there’s no such thing as
too much. Just make sure you
get those lab reports finished
at some point, okay?
The ladies are also much
more likely to have gadgetry
assistance. Once they get to
third and fourth year, most
girls will own at least one sex
toy (does it make diddling the
skittle more efficient, or are
they just too lazy to air the
orchid manually?), but men
very rarely dance around
the maypole using anything
other than their hand and
maybe some lube. It’s best to
mix it up with new sensations
sometimes: men-friends, I’m
buying you all Tenga eggs for
Christmas.
Personally, I like to finish
off my days with a bit of Etsy
kimono shopping. Sometimes
it’s a frantic expression of
horniness, and sometimes
it’s time that I set aside for a
bit of self-care at the end of
the day. Bashing the Bishop
is something that you should
do for you, as it has the great
benefits of making you feel
good about yourself, while
improving the sex you have
with other people (although
no-one will ever make love
to you like you do). So get
out there and make momma
proud. Play pocket pinball
to your heart’s content – you
don’t need to be ashamed.
