After a week of controversy, Abigail Sawyer looks into
the chemistry of cryogenics
F
or starters, here’s a
myth buster: Walt
Disney was not
actually cryogenically
frozen.
With news emerg-
ing this week concerning a
terminally ill 14-year-old girl
winning a court case against
her father allowing her to
be cryogenically frozen, I
decided to explore exactly
what this entails.
First of all, let’s get down
to the science. When tissues
are cooled, water molecules
move around much slower,
interact with each other more
and begin to form ice crys-
tals. These ice crystals tend
to form first outside the tissue
cells. This makes the concen-
tration of other substances
outside tissue cells much
higher and so, by the magic
of osmosis, water molecules
move from inside the cells to
outside. The ice crystals grow
and the tissue cells shrink and
are damaged by the newly
formed ice crystals.
Vitrification is a method
used to prevent this damage.
Tissues can be cooled and
\\ Companies offer

solidified, being preserved
without any damage by
replacing blood with a
solution that is basically an
anti-freeze combined with an
organ preservation fluid. It
allows tissues to be stored at
extremely low temperatures.
You can imagine that there
are many toxicity issues asso-
ciated with this. Scientists are
currently working on these
problems and the companies
offering cryogenic freezing,
for £160,000 a go, are fairly
confident that with time, these
issues can be solved!
Now that we’ve established
that there’s a theoretical
possibility for it to work, can
it actually work in real life?
Who knows! No one that has
been cryogenically frozen has
been brought back to life yet,
however, success with cryonics
Tis the season to be... cryogenically

Lizzie Riach explores new research into how wounds heal, and why older
people are at a significant disadvantage if they injure themselves
Woundshealwith(alotof)time
S
ince World War
I, scientists have
noticed how the
speed of healing
is much slower
in older veterans
compared to younger ones.
But for an entire century, we
had no idea why this was the
case, until now.
Researchers at the Rocke-
feller University have started
to unlock this aspect of the
aging body by looking at
wounds in mice. Usually when
the skin is broken due to an
injury, skin cells move to the
site to repair the break due
to the coordination of nearby
immune cells. But in older
mice, experiments showed
this communication between
skin and immune cells to be
disrupted, slowing this pro-
cess down.
Healing wounds is one of
the body’s most complicated
process, with a host of dif-
ferent molecular pathways.
Signalling between cells
occurs from the first few sec-
onds of injury to months after
healing has occurred.
A crucial part of healing is
the formation of a scab, a fea-
ture that is in no means there
to be picked. Its function is to
protect the open wound until
a more robust skin layer is
formed. These new skin cells
are known as ‘keratinocytes’,
and fill in the wound under
the scab until all is healed. In
the older mice, the keratino-
cytes were much slower to
migrate in place. The result?
Wounds in aged mice often
took many more days to
close compared to the
young‘uns.
The work being done
could potentially be used
to enhance healing in the
elderly if we find out the
specific signals required.
As Elaine Fuchs, head
of the Robin Chemers
Neustein Laboratory of
Mammalian Cell Biology,
says, “our work suggests it
may be possible to develop
drugs to help aging skin
cells communicate better
with their immune cell
neighbours, boosting sig-
nals that normally decline
with age”.
F
act: There’s a cat
that is co-author of
a theoretical physics
paper.
In 1975, American
mathematician and
physicist Professor Jack H.
Hetherington wrote an entire
paper (on low temperature
physics, if you were wonder-
ing) on a typewriter, only to
be told by his supervisor that
it would be rejected by the
journal he was intending to
publish it in – Physical Review
Letters – as had written “we”
and “us” throughout despite
being the sole author.
Rather than re-type his
whole paper, he decided
to add a worthy co-author
instead – namely one F.D.C.
Willard. Which of course
stands for FELIX Domesticus
Chester Willard. Which of
course was his faithful Sia-
mese cat.
The paper was accepted
and published. F.D.C. Willard
went on to publish, as the
sole author, an article titled
“Two-, Three- and Four- atom
Exchange Effects”… and no,
I don’t understand what that
means either. Chester was
regularly cited for his “useful
contributions” and was even
offered a physics fellowship
at Michigan State University.
Three gruelling years of
Natural Sciences at Cam-
bridge and there is some cat
that is objectively a more
successful scientist than I am. I
mean what is the point...

has been shown for IVF as it
is used to preserve semen
and eggs. There aren’t even
any cases of animals being
successfully revived either,
but a rabbit brain was
reportedly recovered earlier
this year in an “excellent”
state. Even with this success,
there is no evidence that
brain functions, personality,
or memories would be
recovered.
So, what’s the verdict?
If you have the money to
spare, it might be worth a
go. It really depends on how
much trust you have in the
future of scientific progress.
I
t has been known for a
long time that galaxies
move, and our Milky
Way is no exception.
The Milky Way and its
50 neighbours, together
referred to as the ‘Local
Group’, have been moving
in a particular direction, and
until now it was not known
why. A team of researchers
from South Africa, Germany,
and Australia suggest that
a supercluster of galaxies is
the reason behind the huge
gravitational pull.
A supercluster is a collection
of hundreds of galaxies, and
it’s the largest structure known
to exist in space. International
researchers measured around
4500 redshifts (a change in
wavelength, used to measure
distance), via the constellation
Veta. They took measure-
ments from galaxies either
side of a plane of the Milky
Way to determine the pres-
ence of a particularly high
density of galaxies around
800 million light years away.
This new supercluster is much
larger than the previously dis-
covered Shapely supercluster,
around 650 million light years
away.

O
ver a pint in
Clapham,
my friend
exclaimed
that they,
along with
the entire top deck of the
345 bus, had seen a seal
in the Thames on the way
to college. At first I was
sceptical. Whilst the odd
whale has occasionally
been known to take a wrong
turn, how could anything,
especially something as large
as a seal, live daily in such
polluted water?
Surprisingly, the Thames
isn’t as bad as you’d expect,
despite its history as a
sewage sink and the count-
less chemical leakages. In
the almost 60 years since
the river was proclaimed
‘biologically dead’, strict
legislation implemented on
waste disposal has led to the
Thames now becoming the
cleanest it’s been in more than
150 years. The transformation
even won the International
Theiss River prize for out-
standing restoration in 2010,
out-competing the Yellow
River in China, the Hattah
Lakes in Australia, and the
Smirnykh River in Japan.
Habitat reconstruction pro-
jects have helped repopulate
the river with more than
125 species of fish and 400
species of invertebrates. Birds
now wade from its banks and
even large vertebrates such
as dolphins can be spotted
regularly. The most impressive
re-establishment of a marine
mammal population comes
from our British seal species:
the harbour seal and the grey
seal. Over the last 15 years
seal numbers have increased
dramatically with over 900
seals being estimated to live
along the estuary last year,
an increase from the 708 in
2013.
Despite their increasing
numbers, Thames seal
populations are still very
vulnerable to disease. The
Phocine Distemper Virus
(PDV), which causes fever
and breathing problems,
has had major outbreaks
in Thames seal populations
in both 1988 and 2002.
Conservationists are now
concerned that with the
potential for a 14-year
disease cycle the virus could
rear its head again immi-
nently. No evidence of PDV
has been found in the river as
of yet.
In order to help conserve
the seals, which are top
predators in important
estuarine ecosystems, the
Zoological Society of London
(ZSL) has been monitoring
their progress. In 2012 the
organisation tagged 10 har-
bour seals with GPS systems
Emma Parkin talks seal sightings and how the Thames has cleaned up its act
Lara Bailey explains why the ‘Vela Supercluster’ could be the reason for why the Milky Way and
surrounding galaxies are constantly on the move
and in 2013 they introduced
annual population surveys
using planes and boats to
get counts. However, one of
the most important sources
of information comes from
the public driven Thames
Marine Mammal Sighting
survey which ZSL has run
since 2004. Within the first
ten years over 1,300 marine
mammal sightings were
recorded, all of which were
crucial to better understand-
ing our seals.
So, despite its murky
appearance, the Thames is
a hospitable environment for
many creatures. Its biggest
problem now is plastic, with
campaigns such as #OneLess
trying to reduce levels of plas-
tic pollution. If you want to
see one of our furry friends,
your best chance is currently

\\ The Vela Super-
cluster is much bigger
than the previously
discovered Shapely
supercluster \\
Despite its size, it was only
recently found because it was
hidden behind the cosmic
dust and stars of the plane of
the Milky Way. The lead pro-
fessor of the study, professor
Renee Kraan-Korteweg of
the University of Cape Town,
said: “I could not believe such
a major structure would pop
up so prominently.”
Superclusters, due to their
scale, have a significant
impact on the movement
of other galaxies. Further
research is needed to
appreciate the influence and
extent of the supercluster,
and in particular to explain
the direction and velocity of
the Local Group’s movement.
More observations will help
determine the contribution of
the Vela supercluster to the
larger-scale structure of this
pocket of our vast universe.
