ou know what I miss
most about the olden
days? Not women
knowing their place,
or the coloureds not
being able to to talk
back to a fine respecting member
of civilised society such as myself,
but the fact you just can’t crush
a liberal protest like you used to
be able to. You know what was a
good protest? Kent state in 1970.
It goes without saying that things
got out of hand, but you can’t
deny that those long-hairs learnt
a good lesson about respecting
authority and respecting guns.
Where we lost our way was
being too worried about how the
media perceives being strong and
decisive as opposed to being a
walkover liberal.
Yet again this week we had
students crying about the fact
that they are having their uni-
versity paid for and that they
have access to higher educa-
tion, as well the state giving
them money to spend on booze
and dib-dabs. How about you
get a job you lazy hippies?
The only reason there’s youth
unemployment is because these
losers with their degrees in
communications and art history
are too worried about creating
safe spaces and not triggering
other people in order get some
life experience. ‘Oh i just want
to travel and enjoy life’ GET A
FUCKING JOB ‘I’m not really
sure what I want to do just yet’
GET A FUCKING JOB ‘ I have
stage four leukaemia’ STOP
GIVING ME EXCUSES YOU
PUSSY AND GET A JOB.
Of course if someone on the
right wing starts to protest
about something, then we’re
racist and bigoted, but as soon
as a couple of junior doctors
might have to work for the first
time in six years, it’s no holds
barred, right?! When I protested
the election of Barack HUS-
SEIN Obama I was labelled a
crybaby, but through my manly,
patriotic tears, I continued rail-
ing against his attempt to censor
free speech and make being
white illegal to the present day.
Nowadays, however, these
sore losers hold their shitty
signs against a democratically
elected man who has done
nothing more than grab a few
pussies. Furthermore, you would
think with millions of art grad-
uates crying, they could have
made better signs. Maybe a
few more colours. Maybe a bit
more white. Not racist.
T
his week I finally did
what my tumblr has
been promising for ages:
I changed society for
the better and, perhaps,
reversed a politician’s
mind all by myself! I held up a
piece of A3 paper that I liberated
from the library printer, and
scrawled a piece of pure poetry in
sharpie: “Fuck tory cunts”. In that
single moment I think I may have
solved austerity, found an extra
two billion pounds for the NHS,
and may have finally assured the
election for our lord and saviour
Jeremy Corbyn.
I think the problem that many
people in the labour party
don’t understand is that what
millionaire Eton-educated
conservatives need in order to
see the error of their ways is
a twenty-something millennial
with dreadlocks shouting in the
middle of street on a satur-
day whilst they’re all in their
mansions in Devon, recovering
from a long hard week of doing
nothing.
At one point in the protest it
seemed like we needed both
physical and spiritual nour-
ishment, so luckily my friend
Millicent Montagu-Doug-
las-Scott had brought his guitar
( he is like the best doula I have
ever met and I have been to
boomtown festival). He knows
about three chords, but the pas-
sion with which he plays them
just defies any rules of musical-
ity of rhythm and he just made
protesting even more spiritual
and pure. On the physical front,
I’d luckily baked soya-lentil-ve-
gan concoction and in no time
we were ready to get back
to shouting at the millions of
people ignoring us and tutting
for blocking the way to Bucking-
ham Palace.
What is disgusting, however,
is when people who disagree
with my views are allowed to
protest. It goes against every
democratic right in the western
world to allow a protest about
abortion or gay marriage and
it makes me sick. These people
just shouldn’t be allowed to
protest. They don’t know how to
protest– it should be about love,
unity, and gluten-free snacks,
not about something that has
been democratically made
law by representatives and
something that is approved by
the majority of the country. That
would be like protesting a politi-
cian that was fairly elected into
office just because you don’t like
the person. Oh wait...
If you’re not gluten-
free you can’t protest
with me

This week you do
really badly on a piece
of coursework. Don’t
worry though, there are
many more coming up.
Plenty. More.

This week you
order a vegetarian
burrito. Surprise
motherfuckers it’s just
a veggie burger in a
pretty dress.
This week you spend
all your evenings in the
Library and so can’t
consult the stars to see
if Mercury has indeed
aligned with Queen’s
Tower. This explains the
lack of astrology this week.
Soz.
This week you’re the
new Dolly the sheep
statue in Central
Library. You end up
spending less time
in there than some
students do.
This week you heed felix’s
advice and finally try
masturbation. You like it so
much you decide to form a
new society just for wankers.
Unfortunately due to a typo
you end up forming a society
for bankers. No-one notices.
This week you’re
beside yourself with
anger that Fabric is
reopening. We’d won
the war on drugs!! But
not anymore.
This week you change
your clothes for something
bright and fashionable as
you realise you have been
wearing the same clothes
for all of your degree. No
one likes the new you so
you immediately change
back. Don’t worry tho felix
thinks you look peng.
This week you get
approached by the
illustrious Imperial
drinking society, The
2:1’s. Rumour has it
that they’re the ones
controlling the Beit
Quad Cartel…
This week you
remember that the
Black Friday sales
have started. Yay!
Even more things you
can’t afford to buy
but probably will buy
regardless.
This week you finally
go into your overdraft.
This is great news as
you now aren’t actually
paying for anything, Mr
Santander is.
This week you essentially
live in your labs. You even
have your own place to
nap and stockpile of food.
You probably shouldn’t be
making tea in a distillation
column though.
This week you still
can’t afford to put on
the heating and you
end up like the TfL fees
until 2020. Frozen.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I have a problem. OK well I guess that’s obvious since
I’m writing to you for advice, but anyway the problem is
to do with my housemate. When we started university, he
was one of the most down to earth guys I know, and was
always very open minded to everyone and their views.
This year, however, there has been quite the change. He
has become far more right wing, starting to say that per-
haps we should listen to Donald Trump, and that maybe
we should stop refugees into our country. I like him alot,
but I’m not sure how to get around this obstacle of him
having such awful politics.
Yours anxiously,
Hillary
HOROSCOPES
Shiliary Shiliary Shiliary,
I’m so glad you could ask this question as I’ve
been getting it a lot lately. Change can be
difficult for everyone, especially when it is to
do with housemates who you have to spend a
whole year with. I think the key here is to be
supportive of your friend rather than accusing
them of having ‘awful politics’ just because you
don’t agree with them or because their views
are not based on ‘facts’. Facts are so 2012!!
What even is a fact!!? They’re like magnets:
no-one knows how they work.
Going to the specific examples you have men-
tioned Shiliary, I think we should make it clear
here that Trump won an election that was fixed
for the Democrats to win. He is clearly the
winner that the world needs to tackle problems
like ‘Climate Change’ or ‘Aleppo’ (whatever
that is). As for the refugee crisis do we really
want more ‘ethnic’ people coming over here?
For me this is like putting salt and pepper into
the same shaker, like who would do that!?! So
if you wouldn’t mix salt and pepper why would
you invite others to come into our country? It’s
just common sense!
Anyway, just remember my long standing
advice, if someone challenges your views just
buckle and start agreeing with them. Which
also happens to be the secret to long lasting
friendships.
Big luv,
Chris xxxxx
