Do films have the capacity to influence
and further change in our society and
worldwide? From films like Cowspiracy to
the infamous Triumph of the Will, history
answers the question with a resounding,
‘yes’.
E
ntertainment,
expression, and
education - films
have it covered.
Whilst most people
use films for the
sake of entertainment to
enjoy themselves - to take a
break from life’s stresses, to
escape from reality - they are
also capable of inducing the
opposite effect: films have
the ability to make you more
in tune with reality, to affect
reality, and also to shape it.
The medium of film, especially
in the current day, has a lot
of power. And this power
makes it a very useful tool
in furthering change in our
society and worldwide.
Films allow a person to
express their ideas and
thoughts in a way that is
accessible to the masses.
There are numerous films
that have been made over
the past years that have had
a visible impact in society,
and have been used to speak
out against injustices. They
have been used to start social
movements and they have
been used in political propa-
ganda. The film The Thin Blue
Line literally saved an inno-
cent convicted man’s life; this
documentary, directed by a
detective, used witness state-
ments to re-enacted scenes
of the crime, which led to the
lifting of his sentence, leaving
him a free man. In Super
Size Me, the American fast
food industry was put under
scrutiny, causing a revolution
in the awareness of obesity,
its causes and its effects. The
film even led to McDonald’s
removing its ‘super size’
option from all of its menus.
These are some examples of
tangible results from a film
looking to create change.
Usually, however, the impact
of films is not quantifiable. It
is more subtle and is often left
open to interpretation.
Whether it has an observ-
able impact or not, one
thing is certain: these films
create awareness. Following
the advertising tag line ‘all
publicity is good publicity’, as
long as someone has seen a
film with an aim of informing
someone of a certain matter,
whether they initially agree
with its premise or not, they
know of it. This in itself is
half the battle. Films like Ava
DuVernay’s brilliant 13th,
which exposes a ‘loophole’
in the 13th
amendment which
abolished slavery in the U.S.
while allowing minorities in
America to still be targeted,
the touching After Tiller,
which attempted to educate
people on pro-choice, and
Cowspiracy, which managed
to make almost everyone who
watched it to at least want to
try being a vegetarian, have
impacts that change the way
people think and feel. Some-
thing which cannot be put into
a statistic but in certain ways
is much more important.
While most films that have
championed, or had the inten-
tion of furthering, a cause
have been documentaries,
they are not restricted to that
category. Fictional films can
alcoholic mother, they too
succeeded in gaining a lot of
attention towards their subject
matter and in the case of
Rosetta, political attention to
ensure the payment of mini-
mum wage to youth.
A corollary of film being
a medium which allows any
person to express their ideas
and thoughts however, is that
any person can make use of
film – there is no censorship
on their ideas. History has
shown that films can have had
a disastrous effects on society
too. Films such as The Birth
of a Nation, which arguably
led to the re-birth of the Klu
Klux Klan through its degrad-
ing depiction of African
Americans, and the notorious
German propaganda film,
Triumph of the Will, which
popularized the cause of the
Nazis, are good examples of
this. The impact of these films,
well known to all, shows the
power of film in society. There
is tremendous power and in
the wrong hands it can do
tremendous wrong. But this
also means in the right hands
it can do tremendous good.
In an age where films and
documentaries are churned
out in multitudes, there is no
lack of informative material
out there. Online streaming
sites such as Netflix – which
has around 70 million view-
ers, whilst creating a fair few
extremely good documenta-
ries of its own – further the
mass of video content avail-
able for people to watch.
While people are unlikely
to pay to go to the cinema
and watch a documentary,
they are much more likely to
do so in the comfort of their
own home. Increased viewing
means good news for docu-
mentary filmmakers, whose
main issue is actually getting
people to watch their films. As
Yariv Mozer, director of The
Invisible Men, a documentary
about the plight of gay Pales-
tinian men, said, “Sometimes
raising the awareness of one
person, making him change
the way he looks at reality, at
life, will show when he meets
someone in need, these are
the small things that will make
a big change’’. And as history
has shown, raising awareness
is something film can do very
well.

still carry a strong message

One could say it might even
create more empathy as,
being a work of fiction, the
director is able to create
material to cater to audiences
emotions, whereas with a
documentary film, usually
the directors have to play
with whatever material they
can get which often consists
of what can be thought as
‘dry’ material. Films such as
The Cider House Rules, a film
about back-alley abortions,
and Rosetta, which follows a

Fantastic
Beasts and
Where to
Find Them
U
nless you live
in a cave, it is
quite hard to
overlook the fact
that Fantastic
Beasts and
Where to Find Them is finally
out. First of all, it is difficult
to walk down an entire street
without seeing at least one
poster, and secondly because
the film has immediately
become a source of wild
disputes. Surprisingly, it’s
not a conflict between
Potterheads passionately
defending the film and the
others condemning it – from
my experience, it is often
quite the opposite. What is
the reason behind this and
how well did Fantastic Beasts
actually do?
My first impression after
leaving the theatre was that
the film was very wrongly
advertised as another Harry
Potter story. It is easy to see
why the fans of the original
series might be disappointed
– it is absolutely not. You will
come across references to
Hogwarts and its characters
from time to time, but apart
from those, expect a story
which takes place in the same
world with the same rules,
but explores a completely
different aspect of it. Fantastic
Beasts is not a children’s tale
anymore, it is an adult one.
So, a piece of advice: drop
your expectations of Harry
Potter 8 – there is the Cursed
Child for that – and try to
accept it as a new era of J.K.
Rowling’s magical universe.
Based on the trailer, I was a
bit sceptical whether the plot
would be strong enough to
hold your attention for over
two hours. After all, it’s “only”
a hunt for magical animals,
isn’t it? Luckily, I was more
than pleasantly surprised by
a presence of another, rather
unexpected, storyline which
gives the film a good balance
of light-hearted and dark
moments. Moreover, there
are many brief but important
scenes which reveal that there
is a lot going on under the
surface. Of course, I won’t
spoil it but let’s say that it jus-
tifies the need for four more
parts. Well, at least it does
for me!
The beasts are one of the
highlights of the film. Some
are cute (like Niffler!), others
hilarious and yet others,
awe-inspiring. It is very satis-
fying to see they are not there
for the sake of CGI show-offs
but each have a unique
personality and you’ll surely
find one you’ll love (Niffler!).
Speaking of effects, one has
to admit some of them might
be just for eye candy, but
Fantastic Beasts doesn’t rely
on digital tricks as its main
driving force. And, to be
honest, who doesn’t want to
have their breath taken away
by a majestic Thunderbird?
As for the human char-
acters, I’m sure everyone
has been in love with Eddie
Redmayne aka Newt Scama-
nder several months before
the premiere but the others
deserve at least equal credit
– charmingly quirky Queenie,
slightly creepy Credence, and
Jacob Kowalski, the most like-
able muggle – oops, meant
No-Maj – you’ll ever meet.
You may feel a bit nostalgic
about not being able to watch
the characters mature as in
Harry Potter, but you can
enjoy different aspects of the
magical world, like the inter-
action of wizards with the rest
of the world, and the struggle
they had to go through for
their “deviation”. Moreover,
with five films in total, you’ll
eventually grow up with the
characters as well!
Overall impressions? My
inner fangirl is screaming
incomprehensibly, but even if
I should be objective, Fantas-
tic Beasts and Where to Find
Them is in no way disappoint-
ing. Even if you are not fan
of Harry Potter, I suggest
you give it a go – Fantastic
Beasts is trying its best not to
be like its older sibling, and it
succeeds.
T
he directorial
debut from Czech
directors Petr
Kazda and Tomás
Weinreb – I, Olga
Hepnarová – takes
its title from a line in the
manifesto left behind by the
last woman to be executed
in Czechoslovakia. In 1973,
at the age of 22, Hepnarová
ran over a group of people
with a truck, killing eight, and
was executed with short-drop
hanging. But the title also acts
as an invitation. It invites us
to try and get inside the mind
of a killer to attempt to shed
some light on what, exactly,
drove a young girl to commit
such a horrific act. A pity,
then, that the end result is so
dark and unilluminating.
We follow Hepnarová from
the age of 13, when an early
suicide attempt led to her
incarceration in a psychi-
atric ward. This marks the
first step in a progression of
events marked by increasing
isolation and alienation,
which Hepnarová deals with
by chain-smoking cigarettes
and maintaining an impassive
attitude. The scenes come
and go in a haphazard order,
with individual depressing
vignettes making up a more
isolating whole; with no music
to break up the tension, the
internal relentless rhythm of I,
Olga makes it a trying watch.
Michalina Olszanska’s
dedication to the role of
Hepnarová cannot be denied,
but her character is a glassy-
eyed cipher, whose extreme
unlikeable nature hampers
any emotional connection we
might have. Furthermore, the
fact that Hepnarová is a les-
bian seems to serve no other
function that to justify the
inclusion of several sex scenes
that are as gratuitous as they
are dull, making I, Olga
seem more like a pastiche
of ‘difficult’ European art-
house cinema than anything
fully-realised.
I, Olga invites us to explore
the nature of human evil. But
not even the sumptuous black
and white cinematography,
which complements the 1960s
environs perfectly – and takes
more than a few cues from
Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida –
cannot rescue it. I, Olga goes
to great lengths to prove true
Hannah Arendt’s claim that
the evil really is just banal.
