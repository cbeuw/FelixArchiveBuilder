They’ve probably
spent more time
on their PC than
they have on you
Eight signs you’re dating a gamer
Even romance has become digitalised now \\ Don Hankins
Y
our SO
(significant
other) is simply
the greatest,
they seem to
be perfect in all
aspects. You think you’ve
scored the jackpot and can’t
do any better. But, you have
a nagging suspicion about
them: you think they might
be a gamer. You don’t want
to believe it, but you can’t
deny certain features about
them seem a little unusual. I’m
going to explain certain tell-
tale signs which would prove,
without a doubt, that they are
indeed a gamer.

They have a really massive...
PC, which they use to play
games, complete with things
you didn’t know existed, such
as a liquid-cooling video
card. Honestly, they’ve prob-
ably spent more time on their
PC than they have on you. Of
course, they may also have a
console which sort of counts
but not really. (PC Master
race for life!)
They know the names of all
the 800+ Pokémon, complete
with typings, movepool, abil-
ities, z-moves, and basically
everything there is to know. It
massively dwarfs your knowl-
edge of just Pikachu and its
signature move, thunderbolt.
They will at some point pro-
ceed to tell you how, actually,
volt tackle is Pikachu’s signa-
ture move.
When the new fire emblem
game comes out, it’s all that
they’ll talk about. Every time
you have a conversation with
them from that point onwards,
they’ll use all sorts of names
and phrases you haven’t even
heard of and constantly com-
plain about how the RNG isn’t
in their favour or something.
All you’ll be able to do in
these discussions is smile and
nod like the good SO that
you are.
They can recite all the
upcoming release dates for a
large variety of sequels and
indie games in a heartbeat.
Normally you wouldn’t mind
this too much, if only they
would also remember when
your birthday actually was.
They get really excited at
Christmas and Summer, but
not because they’re excited
to see their family again. It’s
actually because the steam
sale takes place around this
time and they basically blow
their entire bank account on
games they’ll probably never
play in their life.
Whenever you try to spend
some quality time with them,
they will occasionally deny
your request and spout some
nonsense about how live
games can’t be paused and
how the opposing team is
invading the barracks. Usu-
ally at that point, you’d hear
a loud clicking noise from
their room which they simply
explain as ‘lol’.
(APM is actions per minute
you noob!)
A lot of your hang out
sessions involve the two of
you gaming with each other.
Or, to be more precise, them
beating you at whatever
game you guys play with
you winning occasionally;
you know for a fact it’s only
because they let you win.
If the person you’re dating
has even some of these
quirks, it’s time to face the
facts; you’re dating a gamer.
And honestly, there’s nothing
really wrong with it. They’re
people just like you and me
(or even your lecturers). If
they seem to devote more of
their life to games than they
do to you, that might mean
they have severe prioritisation
issues. In this case, it would be
wise to have a nice long talk,
where they need to re-evalu-
ate their life choices. Or, you
can just suck it up and enjoy
the experience of repeatedly
losing against every single
character in Smash. Your call.
Almost all the gifts they
give you are gaming themed.
You’re not entirely sure why
you would want an Assassin’s
Creed gauntlet but you
accept it nonetheless.
