Theladydothprotesttoomuch
Warning: I’m really tired, I have a million things
to do including packing a suitcase for a weekend
escape (yay me), and this editorial has been
a pain in the butt to write so prepare yourself
for some really wishy washy stuff, cause I’m on
course to work 54 hours this week and at this
point I just want to curl up into a little hairy ball
and die, only to be swept away tomorrow by the
cleaners. (That sentence was too long but fuck it)
The plan was to write some inspirational stuff
about protesting, about how action is the only
answer. I was going to rant about the plague
of complacency and apathy that seems to
characterise our world today. I was going to
encourage you to think, to talk, to discuss, to
complain to verbally battle shit out (emphasis on
verbally). I was going to make a point that you
need to fight for change, that you can’t just wait
for it to happen ‘cause one day you’ll wake up
and realise that the world has indeed changed
but has left you behind and has probably banned
something stupid like nipple clamps along the
way too.
But so much shit keeps going down. They came
for our education (It’s not even particularly
good, even VP Education admits to it) , they came
for our drugs (poppers only narrowly escaped)
and now they’re coming for our porn? I mean
come on! So yes, I’m tired and I just can’t look
you in the eye and lie to you. I can’t even be
bothered to type-lie to you.
So here’s the truth. Protesting is hard. It’s not
a one off. It’s a way of life. To protest means to
live life unapologetically. To refuse to be bossed
around. To think freely. To be a protester means
spending your entire life, your entire existence
pushing, for yourself and for others.
This life will eat you up and spit you out. You
will be drained and you will feel dead inside. But
it’s ok. There’s nothing like a short break away
from the daily grind to pump you up again and
make you ready to start pushing again.
