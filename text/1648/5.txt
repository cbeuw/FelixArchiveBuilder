Library gets Dolly the Sheep statue

as a reminder to students,
faculty and staff of one of
the most important scientific
achievements in recent
memory.
S
tudents who have
walked through
the security gates
at Central Library
the past couple of
weeks may have
noticed a strange sculpture
awaiting them before they
turn into the main study areas.
That strange sculpture,
however, is three students’
tribute to one of the most
significant global engineering
feats in the past 20 years.
Dolly the Sheep, represented
at the library by a papier-
mâché statue covered in
newspaper clippings from the
time the story broke, is the first
mammal to ever be cloned
from an adult somatic cell
through the process of nuclear
transfer.
The feat was accomplished
by scientists at the Roslin
Institute, part of the University
of Edinburgh, in July 1996.
Students Ellyw Evans,
Zoe Ohman and Joanna
Wolstenholme created the
sculpture in Central Library,
as part of their science
communication coursework.
Two third-year computing
students, Louis De Beau and
Jonny White, said they knew
about Dolly the Sheep and
took some time to examine the
sculpture at the library.
“We just kind of stared at it
for a minute,” said De Beau,
“But then we moved on. I have
loads of work to get to.”
White added that, at first
glance, the sculpture didn’t
look like a sheep.
“Our mate thought it was a
pig,” he said. “Then, when we
walked over, and he realised
it obviously wasn’t a pig, we
laughed at him.”
At the sculpture at the
library, news clippings from
national newspapers lauded
the achievement. When the
news broke, the BBC reported
raised an ethical dilemma
about whether humans should
be cloned, if the same process
worked on them.
But for now, the sculpture

What went down at the Education demo
Over 15,000 students participated Lef Apostolakis
and the response of the left.
“We’re the sum of the
collective effort not least,
of our education system
and the teachers who keep
it running.... A society that
fails to invest in education
that fails to invest in young
people, fails to invest in it’s
own future,” said Jones.
The march concluded with
celebrations at Goldmsith’s
student Union of reportedly
the biggest student
demonstration since 2010.
S
aturday saw
thousands of
students and
academics take
to the streets to
protest government
cuts and education reforms.
The procession started near
Hyde Park and progressed
through central London with
students holding signs and
shouting chants such as ”no
ifs, not buts, no education
cuts”
For its majority the march
was peaceful, with only a
few isolated of violence
incidents which saw some
participants branching off
from the main procession,
setting off flares outside
parliament and calling for a
rent strike.
The rally was later
addressed by NUS President
Malia Bouattia, political
commentator and Guardian
Columnist Owen Jones
and Labour Leader Jeremy
Corby among others.
Jones gave a particularly
energetic speech during
which he not only addressed
the education crisis the UK
is facing but also touched
upon the threat of fascism IC strongly represented \\ Harrison Jones
