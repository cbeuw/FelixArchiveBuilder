The Trump Effect
| Is Political
correctness to
blame?
Jawaad Farooq offers his verdict on the
reason for Donald’s rise to power
I
t has been argued that
political correctness has
created a culture where
people are afraid of
expressing their views.
This culture has been
exacerbated by far left
labelling and clamping down
on opinions it deems do not
fit into the liberal narrative.
This apparently has led to
the feeling of those who
preach this ‘other’ opinion
(such as Trump supporters)
being delegitimised. Those
opinions are an expression
of a frustration, and in
delegitimising the opinion, the
frustration is also not taken
seriously. Since the outlet of
that frustration is the opinion,
and political correctness does
not allow the legitimisation
of the opinion, political
correctness became the target
for Trump supporters and
a larger motif representing
those factors which are
keeping these people ‘down’
and causing the frustration in
the first place. If Donald Trump
was anything he was politically
incorrect, and because he
was not afraid to speak his
mind, he became a symbol of
legitimising their frustrations.
Repeatedly Trump made the
point that the biggest problem
he felt America was facing was
political correctness, and it
seems his message resonated
with his supporters.
In a weird way, although
the views he was expressing
were reprehensible, the
views themselves mattered
less than the fact that
they were a middle finger
to the politically correct
status quo. Perhaps this
explains why some people
who maybe didn’t actually
support Trumps’ views
backed him.
What about those who
did support him and his
views? There could be a
number of explanations.
Firstly they genuinely were
racist and xenophobic
people. Secondly their
views were a result of
misplaced economic woes.
After the fall of the Berlin
wall, it was said that
history had ended. There
was no other challenger
to liberal democracy, and
the world would progress
towards homogenisation.
But with the rise of liberal
democracy, the prosperity
brought by that same
system hasn’t filtered down
to the masses. They have
not shared in the same
prosperity. Median male
income today in America
is still less than it was in
the 70’s according to The
Economist. For the white
male demographic, the
rise in liberal democracy
has not been synonymous
with rise in their economic
status.
But why does that
lead to racist and
xenophobic viewpoints?
For generations white
Americans, whose privilege
and identity were treated
as almost God given, have
never had to ask questions
of identity, privilege, race
and all other questions
minorities have had to deal
with for their own survival.
This survival instinct in
my opinion creates a
philosophical revolution
within minorities who
become galvanised to take
their equal seat at the table
of society. That awakening
leads to intellectual
self-determination. This
coupled with the actual
social actions are hard
fought victories for the
people, and Hilary’s
supporters, those who
uphold the ideals of
liberal democracy, are
those people. They may
not agree with all of
Hilary’s track record, but
they would choose Hilary
over Trump because she
supports similar ideals.
The white-male
demographic has never
had to go through similar
intellectual and social
upheavals because their
positions in society and
their identity is treated
as a birth right and
embedded in the way
things work, and that
produces a civilizational
arrogance and pride. This
demographic has not seen
the economic prosperity
their country has produced
and has seen its identity
challenged and chipped
away. As a result of this
identity complex, they
are more likely to seek
social explanations for
their frustrations which
include blaming refugees,
immigrants, and all that
they feel is a threat to that
identity. The slogan ‘Make
America Great Again’ is
a throwback to when that
identity reigned supreme
and so did their bank
balances.
Brexit and the Trump vote
may show that the masses
have voted to reject the
ideals of open markets and
liberal democracy as long
as economic prosperity
doesn’t filter down to
them. This doesn’t question
liberal democracy, but
\\ Those opinions
are an expression
of a frustration, and
in delegitimising
the opinion, the
frustration is also not
taken seriously \\
\\ We also need to realise
that if we don’t take people’s
frustrations seriously that
frustration can manifest itself
in many ways \\
rather shows that economic
prosperity must come
hand in hand with social
progression.
Over the course of
history we have seen how
economic frustrations have
manifested in the rise of the
far right and caused once
consolidated identities
and its associated self-
pride to be chipped away
leaving a vacuum for an
ideologically dubious
strongman to take control
and create an enemy to
galvanise their supporters.
The target is usually
immigrants and minorities.
In a world where borders
are as porous as ever,
and different cultures and
points of view are mingling
because of the movement
of vast swathes of people,
it is most important that we
remain open minded.
We also need to realise
that if we don’t take peoples’
frustrations seriously, that
frustration can manifest
itself in many ways.
Donald Trump’s win may
be one such manifestation.
Whilst political correctness
should never be a vehicle
to completely silence
people and their opinions,
it should not also become
completely overturned to
normalise hate which may
manifest and encourage
hateful acts against
minorities who have fought
hard for the status quo to
be changed.
