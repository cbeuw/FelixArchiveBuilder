n an interview with
The Paris Review Joan
Didion describes the act
of writing as "hostile",
explaining further: "you’re
trying to make somebody
see something the way
you see it...wrench around
someone else’s mind". The
same can be said of any form
of art. Truly meaningful art
can confront the viewer with
things they don’t want to hear,
ideas they didn’t know even
existed – it can be a painful
process. As Didion puts it:
"you want to tell somebody
your dream, your nightmare.
Well nobody wants to hear it,
nobody wants to walk around
with it."
Art has a long and rich
history with protest. From
Picasso's Guernica, to the
work of Guerilla Girls
protesting the sexism of the
art world, artists have used
their work to shed light on the
injustice of the world around
them.
In the 1980s, the AIDS
crisis descended on the gay
communities of the liberal
coastal cities of America –
New York, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles – without
warning. These were the
cities where young gay
men had moved to finally
live in relative safety from
the violent homophobia of
more rural areas. Before
HIV, these communities were
places where young people
found connections that they
had been denied growing
up. Seemingly overnight,
young people, who were
already stigmatised and
isolated from wider society,
lost friends, exes, lovers.
Whole communities were
dying of rare cancers.
In H is for Hawk, Helen
MacDonald describes the
act of losing loved ones as
life becoming "a thing made
of holes. Absences. Losses.
Things that were there and
are no longer". Life in the
communities affected by
AIDS must’ve seemed an ever
widening chasm, a gaping
wound of loss after loss that
threatened to swallow them
whole as well.
At first politicians refused to
acknowledge the epidemic;
then, they talked openly of
tattooing patients with their
positive status, of confining
HIV-positive individuals to
camps; the governor of Texas
went as far as saying "if you
want to stop AIDS, shoot the
queers". A generation was
being wiped out whilst their
government took no action to
stem the deaths.
In anger, in desperation,
gay artists did the only thing
had the power to alleviate
suffering, and chose to do
nothing, to reckon with the
blood on their hands.
"To make the private into
something public is an action
that has terrific repercussions
on the pre-invented world"
is the philosophy by which
Wojnarowicz created his
work. In her astonishingly
beautiful book The Lonely
City, Olivia Laing, terms the
'pre-invented world' as the
"existence of mainstream
experience, which seems
benign... its' walls almost
invisible until you’re crushed
against them".
Much of oppression, of
injustice, is about erasure:
the refusal to see injustice
or inequality, denying a
voice to those who are
marginalised. In the face
of this, ‘to make the private
public’ is a powerful act.
Carry That Weight is perhaps
the most recent iteration of
the statement in the art world.
In this feat of endurance
performance art, Emma
Sulkowicz, a Columbia
University visual arts student,
carried a mattress resembling

they could do: they made
art. The ACT UP movement
likened the AIDS crisis with
the Holocaust, reclaiming the
pink triangles Nazis used to
publicly label homosexuals.
In One Day This Kid David
Wojnarowicz surrounded
a photograph of himself
as a gap toothed smiling
boy with a prophecy of his
future: "One day this kid will
do something that causes
men...to call for his death...
he will be subject to loss
home, civil rights, jobs, and
all conceivable freedoms. All
this will happen when in one
or two years he discovers
he wishes to place his naked
body on the naked body of
another boy". Wojnarowicz’s
writing is lyrical, visceral, and
clearly deeply personal. Yet
that boy, the young David,
could be a figure from a
Norman Rockwell painting,
an all-American boy, no
different from any of the
sons of the politicians who
were overseeing a kind of
genocide; Wojnarowicz’s
work, for all it’s confessional
qualities, is universal.
When David Wojnarowicz
himself died of AIDS,
his funeral was a protest
march,which eventually
culminated in his ashes being
scattered on the White House
lawn along with the ashes
of other victims of AIDS.
It was a heart-wrenching,
desperate way of holding the
government accountable for
its neglect; forcing those who
the one she had been raped
on wherever she went for
months, vowing she would
do so until her rapist left
the university. It was an
extraordinarily brave act in
a culture in which women
who come forward with
stories of their assault are
immediately shamed, or
accused of lying to destroy
a man’s reputation. Through
the mattress, Sulkowicz made
the painful emotional weight
of her assault tangible, made
it impossible for the people
around her not to address her
struggles, her demands.
In a world of rising injustice
it’s easy to think: what good
can some splotches on a
canvas do? What good are
words in a play, or a story?
Building a more liberal
world is more than changing
laws. It's about changing
perceptions. This can only
be done by refusing to be
silenced; art is a way of
speaking up, in Didion’s
words, it is a way of "tricking
[the viewer] into listening to
the dream".

y now, it’s a near
certainty you’ll
already have
heard about Vice
President-elect
Mike Pence’s trip to
Broadway’s hip-hop musical
sensation, Hamilton. If you
haven’t, it’s all rather simple:
Pence went to the show,
and following the curtain
call, one of the cast stepped
forward and addressed
Pence directly. Flanked by
one the most diverse casts on
Broadway, Brandon V. Dixon
(the show’s Vice president
Aaron Burr) read a speech
written by Hamilton creator
Lin-Manuel Miranda, director
Thomas Kail, and producer
Jeffrey Seller from a piece of
paper: "We are the diverse
Americans who are alarmed
and anxious that your new
administration will not protect
us, our planet, our children,
our parents, or defend us
and uphold our inalienable
rights." Dixon went on to ask
Pence to "work on behalf of
all of us… men and women of
different colors, creeds and
orientations."
Pence, to his credit (not
words I ever thought I’d
write), took the whole thing
relatively well, revealing that
he "wasn’t offended by what
was said." He praised the
"incredible" show and the
"incredibly talented" cast, but
added "I’ll leave to others
whether that was the appro-
priate venue to say it." But
if Pence took the (relatively)
high road, his boss opted for
a lower one. Through that
most Presidential of mediums,
Twitter, President-elect Donald
Trump claimed that the cast
"harassed" Pence, before
insisting that "the Theater
must always be a safe and
special place." He’s wrong.
The theatre is special, yes, but
theatre is not safe.
Theatre can’t be safe. To
be effective, to provoke, to
challenge, theatre cannot
full well what they are in for,
because you (quite simply)
cannot book a ticket for
Hamilton without knowing
anything about it. Somebody
like Pence is not a helpless
individual, quite the opposite.
They hold the power.
With Pence comes an
opportunity. A chance to chal-
lenge that power, to address
how it is used. A direct
address, from a multi-racial
cast, many of whom are part
of the LGBTQ+ community,
to a man who has thus far
proven himself anything but
their ally, is just an extension
of the theatre that came
before it. It is a request for
respect, a plea to be heard
and treated as equals. It is an
action with profound mean-
ing, as profound as anything
that occurs in the preceding
musical. To brand that action
as "harassment", to demand
an apology, to insist that thea-
tre be seen as a "safe space",
is to miss the point entirely.

\\ Theatre is by its
very nature not safe
- it shouldn't be \\
afford to be safe. Safe means
boring, and boring does not
change minds. Boring doesn’t
challenge people’s opinions,
doesn’t make them assess
why they believe what they
believe.
Hamilton used to challenge
opinions, with great success,
but with its success has come,
inevitably, a neutering. Its
audience now is almost
entirely comprised of the
faithful or those with enough
money to afford a seat.
Hamilton’s message – that
America is, and always has
been, a nation of immigrants,
founded on cooperation and
compromise – needs to be
heard, but the people in that
theatre aren’t the ones who
need to hear it. Hearts are
being stirred, but minds are
not being changed in the
auditorium of the Richard
Rogers Theater. Until the
moment where someone like
Mike Pence walks in – a man
who has promoted conversion
therapy for homosexuals, a
man serving in an adminis-
tration that has unmistakably
aligned itself with the euphe-
mistically-named 'alt-right'
(or, in plain English, 'white
supremacist') movement.
Anybody walking into
Hamilton does so knowing
works in the here and now:
it may draw from the past,
present, and future, but it is
inescapably of the moment.
Its very nature isn’t safe: as
a live event, countless things
could go wrong. Every effort
is made to prevent that, but
it is a human medium. The
thoughts and ideas of the
writer are made flesh by the
actors on stage (and the crew
behind them), and commu-
nicated to the audience in
that room. To be "safe", to
not provoke in any way, is to
waste the immense power that
connection wields.
The cast of Hamilton knew
this. They knew that theatre
allows for the speaking of
truths, and on this occasion
they chose to embody that
literally. They stepped for-
ward, and they spoke truth
to power. They embraced
theatre at its purest – the
words of a writer, spoken
through an actor, addressed
to an audience. In the face
of hatred spreading across
the world, they made a polite
and respectful gesture, using
their position to speak for
those who could not. It wasn’t
"safe", because it couldn’t be.
