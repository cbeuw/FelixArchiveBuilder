In Rick Famuyiwa’s Dope,
Jay-Z’s Blueprint is described
as the "punctuation mark to
90s Hip-hop". It seems to me
that, in many ways, Albert
Camus’ The Rebel is the
punctuation mark to 19th, and
early 20th
century philosophy.
Camus is often regarded,
rightly, as an absurdist
and, more questionably, as
a humanist. In his earliest
works, Camus took a purely
absurdist stance: questioning
the meaning of life and
whether it was worth living at
all. However, his experiences
as part of the French
Resistance during the Second
World War galvanised his
belief in the importance of
safeguarding all human life.
In his first post-war novel,
The Plague, the protagonist
pins down the crux of Camus’
stance – there is no grandeur
or heroism in saving lives; it
is simply what must be done.
The Rebel, arguably the
philosopher’s most important
work, is the culmination of
these ideas.
It is an exploration of
rebellion and revolution,
both metaphysical and
historic, in the context of the
dominant philosophies and
artistic movements of the
era. Taking a harsh lens at
both the French and Russian
Revolutions, The Rebel
considers the noble birth
of rebellion and its ultimate
domination and corruption
by firm ideology. More than
this, it offers a just way to
live while making the world a
better place.
Moral absolutism and
unflinching adherence to an
ideology are highlighted as
dangerous pitfalls that quickly
lead the revolutionary into
doing more harm than good.
Indeed, this may seem ironic
given the previously stated
commitment to absolutely
protecting life. However, one
of the book’s great strengths
is that this principle is derived
logically, with no appeals to
morality. The reader is invited
to satisfy themselves of this
deduction, rather than accept
it as an a priori. In fact, one
of the great strengths of the

writing is precisely this. No
unjustified demands are made
of the reader, and the tone is
not fierce or overly fanatical.
The titular rebel is
characterised succinctly: an
individual who sees inequality
or injustice being exercised,
either upon themselves or
others, and desires its end.
Camus begins with man’s
metaphysical rebellion
against God. Dostoevsky’s
Ivan Karamazov is cleverly
summoned here to give form
to the quintessential rebel.
The suffering of a child in this
world is considered too steep
a price to pay for God and
the eternal kingdom in the
next one. Ivan’s rejection of
the Divine encodes one of the
central themes of The Rebel,
the idea that suffering today
cannot be forfeited in favour
of some nebulously defined
future utopia. Poetically,
Ivan’s later fate, left unsaid by
Camus, also analogises the
aforementioned corruption
of rebellion. In general, the
work argues that ideals must
end when they demand the
debilitation or destruction of
others.
Camus chastises the French
Revolution for its eventual
treatment of the nobility.
He astutely points out the
juvenility of the wanton
slaughter undertaken in an
attempt to tear down the
principle of Divine Right and,
by extension, God. He then

tackles the philosophical
behemoth of the 20th
century,
Nihilism. By pointing out
the logical inconsistencies
within it and its unsavoury
aspects, he strives to tear
down the seemingly utopian
idealism of the time. The
false promises of Nazism
and Communism are shown
to simply be the old wolf
of religion in new clothing.
Heaven is replaced with
some infinitely far off perfect
world, where the 'temporary'
suffering and slavery of
certain people now is justified
by the 'eventual' ultimate
freedom of all. Indeed, the
bravery of this stance must
be praised. At the time of The
Rebel’s publication, much
of the French intelligentsia
were avid supporters of
Communism. Camus was one
of the few willing to make a

stand.
Rebellion tends to evoke
images of violent conflict.
The Rebel shows us that
true rebellion is the exact
opposite. It is not the fight
for absolute freedom, which
means the freedom of the
strong to dominate the weak.
Nor does it desire absolute
justice, the application of
which necessitates a fascistic
domination of everything. It is
instead a never-ending battle
to demand better. It is self-
sacrifice, and valuing your
fellow man above all else.
Vigilance must be maintained
for that which would sacrifice
life today for an unknown
tomorrow. Camus’ greatest
wisdom lies in recognising
that rigid adherence to any
ideals is dangerous, and that
ideals cannot supplant reality.
But, in the spirit of his voice,
don’t take my word for it,
read The Rebel.
