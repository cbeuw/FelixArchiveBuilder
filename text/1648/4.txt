Union’s three year strategy proposal
Hopefully they’ve got 2020 vision Matt Johnston
website asked for student
opinion on a range of topics,
from academic experience
to the range of services that
are offered by both the Union
and College put on. Also
touched upon are mental
health, financial problems and
housing issues.
The survey was criticised
by some, however, who felt
that Student Media was
unfairly singled out over
other CSPs. One section of the
questionnaire revolved around
how the various media outlets
(including IC Radio, ICTV,
T
he Union this week
released its plan so
far for 2017-2020
and opened it up to
feedback from the
student body. This
is the final round of drafting,
feedback, and re-drafting of
the proposals, in a process
that’s been ongoing since the
start of this calendar year.
The previous round of
consultation revealed,
unsurprisingly, that the
differing categories of
students (broken down into
first year undergraduates
(UGs), second year UGs
onwards, and postgraduates)
had different opinions on what
mattered most. ‘Fun events’
and Clubs, Societies & Projects
(CSPs) were most important to
first year UGs; in comparison,
mental health/wellbeing was
more of a priority for UGs in
their second year onwards.
Postgraduate students felt
that CSPs mattered most to
them as well, alongside the
aforementioned ‘fun events’
category, whatever that
means.
A survey on the Union
and felix) are performing and
on an existential level, what
their purpose is. The initial
version of the survey that
was circulated was fraught
with both grammatical and
formatting mistakes making
some questions impossible
to answer properly, or at
all. It also asked students
to directly comment on the
performance of the purely
student volunteer-run ICTV
and IC Radio. This was later
amended to focus just on the
performance of felix due to
its sabbatical editor. Feedback
on other sabbatical roles was
not requested.
The final strategy will be
signed off by the Board of
Trustees in December and
then enacted at the very start
of next year.
The survey can be
completed via www.
imperialcollegeunion.org or
feedback can be given at
sessions at various campuses
throughout this month.
Concerns were also raised
about the effects that such
radical restructuring might
have on SOLE scores.
As some evidence exists
suggesting that SOLE rewards
enthusiastic lecturing often to
putting too much pressure
on many already over-
worked Imperial academics.
Imperial can be a very high
pressure environment, not
only for students but also
for researchers. We raised
questions such as: ‘Does the
new strategy have mechanisms
in place that will look into
the welfare of Imperial
researchers and lecturers?’,
‘If someone is not necessarily
very good at lecturing, will
that have an impact on their
career?’, and ‘How is College
looking into how this will affect
staff?’
College and Union
representatives replied
reassuringly. “It’s important
to create a safe space during
this exercise and maybe let go
of SOLE scores for a while,
because those are the kinds
of things that will keep people
behind”, said Buitendijk. When
asked about the consequences
on staff careers in the case
of failure to embrace the
new teaching framework, it
was made clear that the new
strategy was more about the
carrot than the stick.
Yet these changes might have
to progress faster than some
might feel comfortable with.
With higher education getting
marketised and becoming
more of a product, especially
in the wake of a post-Brexit
Britain, improving teaching
standards will become a
marketing priority.
At the moment, the
discrepancy between teaching
and research is a problem:
“Whenever we come to
try and find the marketing
messages around the college,
it is very much centred around
our research expertise and
fabric to reopen under strict drug control
Because who doesn’t love soberly flailing about to techno?

in the tide of club closures in

London’s nightlife. Is public
support of venues like fabric
finally being represented by
its political counterparts?
T

nightclub, fabric,
has announced
it will reopen its
doors, following
a hearing at
Highbury Corner Magistrate’s
Court on Monday, the 21st
of November. The club was
closed in September after
two 18-year-olds tragically
died of drug-related causes
at the venue this Summer.
An appeal date had been
set for the 28th
November,
after a successful campaign
including widespread support
from the community, however
a settlement has now been
reached. The new licensing
agreement has been signed
by both the club and the
council and was approved by
judge Robin McPhee.
It includes 32 new and
stringent conditions, which
include: roles such as
“premises supervisor”, head
of welfare, head of security
and search captains; a new
welfare team trained by the
drug charity, Loop, to detect
clubbers at risk; increased
CCTV surveillance for signs
of dealing; drug awareness
training for all staff; ID
scanners at the entrance;
no entry for under 19s; and
lifetime bans for clubbers
caught using or in possession
of drugs.
A joint statement has
been released, with fabric
saying: “fabric accepts that
its procedures in relation to
searching were insufficient, as
were its procedures to prevent
the consumption and dealing
of drugs within the club itself.”
“fabric accepts that the
police acted reasonably in
making the application for a
review and that the authority’s
sub-committee was fully
entitled to revoke its licence.”
The decision has been
met with celebration from
DJs, artists, and fans of
the club. Chase and Status
and Annie Mac opined on
Twitter, commending the
decision as “brilliant news”
and “amazing, amazing,
amazing” respectively.
Thanks must, in part, go
to the huge swell of support
from advocates of the club.
Following the club’s closure
in September, the club
launched the #saveourculture
campaign. At time of writing,
it has raised over £320,000,
with donations in the £1000s
from artists, venues and
members of the public. The
club acknowledged this
in its statement: “We owe
everything to our supporters.
We really would not be
here today without your
unparalleled support and
generosity. So many different
people stepped up to put their
voices to our cause, artists
from all corners of the music
community, fellow promoters
who have put on huge events
from us and clubbers from
around the world who all

also raised concerns about
there’s very little that we
can actually say about our
teaching,” said a marketing
staff member, suggesting
Imperial should take steps to
elevate teaching to the level of
the research undertaken.
“We’re going to do that,
once we have something to be
proud of,” replied Buitendijk.
“I think now it’s a little tricky,
especially with the NSS
results, but as soon as we feel
we have something to show
for it, definitely.”

The email was sent out
to stop rumours of fatality

and to point those in need of

also said “College staff are

among the four
pedestrians injured
last night during
a car collision on
North End Road. The accident
occurred shortly before 18:45
when it is believed, according
to Metropolitan Police reports,
that a black Audi A3 crashed
into the pedestrians.
The three medical students,
all in their twenties, and the
56-year-old man involved in
the collision were taken to
hospital. One of the medical
students is in critical condition,
while the remaining injured
are in non-life threatening
condition.
A 19-year-old woman
was arrested by officers on
suspicion of causing injury
by dangerous driving. She is
currently in custody. It hasn’t
been made clear if the woman
arrested was the driver of
the vehicle involved in the
collision.
A female passenger who
was in the vehicle involved
received treatment at the
scene for minor injuries.
Earlier today, an email
was sent out to the faculty of
medicine by Martin Lupton,
Head of Undergraduate
Medicine, for reassurance.
“Dear Students, yesterday
evening at 19:10 [sic] there
was an accident on the North
End Road. A car hit a number
of pedestrians, three of whom
were students at our medical
school”
“In that dark moment,
however, there were acts
of light. A number of other
medical students gave support
and comfort at the scene
and I want to thank them all
sincerely.”
“Could I ask that you keep
these three… in your thoughts
today. As always, please do
