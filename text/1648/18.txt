Four hours of tapas-style dining later
felix follows Christy Lam during a
gastronomical overload, as she
indulges in an arguably hefty amount
of delights, including but not limited
to those of the turkish type.
tender, fell from the bone with
a slight nudge with a fork,
oozing with its natural juices
with every mouthful. This fish,
supposedly meant for two
people, was more than a
family feast.
The salads that came with
the fish did not lack in effort
and helped to add a layer
back into the food triangle:
the Yesil Salata was a simple
salad with rocca, a tougher
version of our usual rocket
leaves, while the Gavurdag
was a refreshing mixture of
green and red tomatoes with
walnuts and mint.
A dinner party cannot end
without a sweet note. A selec-
tion of desserts was served,
along with strong Turkish
coffee and Turkish delights.
S
ometimes I wish
I could duplicate
myself. One to go
to those dreaded
9am lectures,
one to do the
laundry and one to tend to
the exploding experiments
in the lab. And at the end of
the day, we can all gather
and dine at one of the many
restaurants on my to-visit list.
There’s nothing wrong with
dining on your own, you may
say. For most cases, I agree.
I can shamelessly walk in,
ask for a table for one, then
spend the entire meal staring
at a wall. I’m totally comfort-
able with that. But there are
places where singletons are
a no-no, and this is still true
when it comes to tapas-style
dining.
Yes, the art of sharing food
has finally graced this cold,
selfish land where stealing
a chip off your companion’s
plate was once a much
frowned upon act. Why keep
all the food to yourself when
you can order more, fill the
table and share the guilt with
a friend?
One such restaurant to
introduce the sharing culture
is Yosma, where I had been
dying to visit ever since they
opened in August. This latest
addition to the Marylebone
food scene is a restaurant and
bar combining the three main
pillars of Istanbul’s dining
culture: meyhane (a word
meaning tavern), mangal
(barbeque) and seafood.
Think plates of mezze, kebabs
and Turkish delights for
dessert. If cloning technology
had advanced past Dolly the
sheep I would’ve been with
my cohort of Christys weeks
ago.
Thanks to my blogger
friends, I need not wait until
year 2198 to satisfy my
hunger for grilled lamb chops
and manti (Turkish dump-
lings). I received an invite
to experience the meyhane
side of life: the vibrant Turkish
culture of food sharing, con-
versation and bottomless raki,
quenching the thirst of the
stomach and the soul.
The evening started off
with me being late again,
sprinting down Baker Street
on heels and sweating in the
early September breeze. The
restaurant was an entirely dif-
ferent world, sheltered from
the rush-hour street outside:
relaxed, cosy and dimly lit,
complete with dark wooden
tables and two huge olive
trees in the centre, hip music
and light-hearted chatter
amongst the occasional clat-
ter from the open kitchen.
Cocktails are always the
best introduction to any
restaurant. Yosma’s cocktail
menu comprised of a hand-
ful of unique cocktails, all
inspired by Turkish culture-
with names taken from love
poems. My favourite was the
Sil Bastan, a sweet cocktail
with yoghurt gin, Manuka
honey, milk acid, egg white
and lemon. Yoghurt-flavoured
foam floated on top of the
bittersweet mixture, strong
enough to deflate the stress
from a long day. The other
one worth mentioning was
Yosma, a fruity, bitter, red
number with Turkish apple tea
vodka, pomegranate,
vermouth and raki spices.
With everyone comfort-
ably seated and the shy
handshakes transformed into
intimate conversations, we
were introduced to the heart
of meyhane: raki.
Raki is a strong Turkish,
anise spirit, served to pair
with the many plates of
mezze and to accompany the
hours of delightful laughter
that followed. To start off,
we took a sip of the clear,
strong-smelling liquid from the
specially-designed glasses.
That was a powerful hit to
my system. Then, following
the traditions, we diluted the
remaining with water and ice,
looking on in wonderment as
the alcohol turned opaque in
contact with water. Salgam,
a sour turnip juice that tasted
rather like pickle juice, was
handed around to cleanse the
palette from raki.
The mezze plates came one
by one, and soon filled the
table with more than plenty
to share. Each one designed
to match the accompanying
raki.
The Kavun was more than
just melon and feta. Take a
bite of melon, a sip of raki
and a chunk of soft feta with
basil olive oil to cleanse the
palette. The hummus was one
of the best I have ever tasted:
creamy, garlicky and not too
much tahini. The Fava looked
like panna cotta, but made
with crushed broad beans
with olive oil and dill. The
Pastırma, which was a dish
of paper-thin slices of cured
beef, gave a spicy, flavourful
kick to balance the raki. The
Levrek Marine was a more
exotic version of a carpaccio,
with marinated sea bass,
grapefruit, fennel and green
chilli. I was torn between the
Köpoglu and the Pancar as
my favourite mezze – the
former was soft chunks of
sweet aubergine in yoghurt
and the latter being a beauti-
fully presented dish of sweet,
pit roasted golden beetroot in
garlic oil.
If you thought that was the
end of the meal, you’d be
very, very wrong indeed.
Turkish cuisine is known for
its generosity, meaning more
than enough food to satisfy
your stomach at appetisers
already – with the mains
still cooking in the kitchen.
So, when the mains were
announced it almost felt like
an anticlimax, which instantly
turned into surprised excla-
mations as the humongous,
monstrous, barbequed whole
fish arrived steaming hot
on its silver platter, its thick,
charcoal-coloured skin scored
to reveal the pearly-white
flesh beneath. The meat was Christy Lam
Apart from spending a good
amount of time trying to
decrypt our futures from the
sludge of coffee grinds at the
bottom of our cups, we took
care to enjoy the traditional
desserts. The kunefe definitely
had substantial wow-fac-
tor with its crispy, golden
yellow Kadoyif pastry and
its incredible white cheese
strings, temporarily silencing
our worries for our hips. The
Sambali was a chunk of fluffy
semolina cake, served with
mastic (a fragrant plant resin
used in Turkish desserts) ice
cream, reminiscent of the
lunchtime sponge cakes from
my school days. The Armut
Pismaniye comprised of half
a poached pear balanced
on top of a perfect sphere
of ice cream, with a cloud of
cotton candy and a generous
handful of walnuts.
Satisfied after almost four
hours of non-stop feasting,
talk and laughter, we called
an end to the meet-up,
exchanged eager hugs that
matured from the raki and
headed home to rest our
bellies for the next day.

a recipe, takes a two hour detour and

Following a recipe is not as easy as it sounds
T
he most challenging
thing for me is to
follow a recipe:
I rarely do it, as
most of the time
I only improvise
with what I have in the
kitchen or what is given to me
(thank you, nice people who
stopped eating my food and
started bringing their own).
So imagine me standing in
front of a cookbook, trying to
understand how things work
– some Chemistry labs have
less complicated instructions,
I swear!
But the good part is that
the food was supposed to be
ready in 30 minutes – yes,
you’ve heard me right! Just
30 minutes for a multiple
course meal and dessert! And
enough food for four people.
The student’s dream, right?
You may say I’m a dreamer
and you are right: no real
food is done in 30 minutes,
trust me. There were eight of
us chopping and doing all the
preparatory work – OK, let’s
be fair, eight people, some
trying to do things while the
others tried not to be in their
way.
Things became rather
complicated. Ok, let me start
this over, in a more simple
manner: My friends and I
(eight people in total) decided
to have a Friday night dinner,
trying to make the food
following one of Jamie’s 30
minutes recipe: Chicken Pie,
French Style Peas, Sweet
Carrot Smash and Dessert
(supposedly Berries, Short-
bread & Chantilly Cream).
The problems started when
we decided (we, not just pre-
tentious me!) that we didn’t
want to buy rolled puff-pastry
Pastry
Mix the salt and flour. Add
the butter, broken up into
small pieces and mix all the
and we wanted to make our
own. This single step took
three hours, but if you can
follow any googled recipe
and not start a flour fight
(please, don’t!), then you’ll be
fine in 50-60 minutes. Also,
don’t let a bunch of incapa-
ble students who’ve never
stepped in the kitchen before
attempt this part – the pastry
DO NOT start throwing it
at other people! Add just
half the water and whisk
everything together before
adding some more. In the
end, you should get a pretty
solid piece of dough. Cover
the bowl with cling film and
let it rest in the fridge for 20
minutes. The last step: take
out the pastry and roll it out,
then wrap it (take the upper
third and fold it to the centre.
Do the same for the lower
third and repeat this two to
three times – the more times
you repeat it, the puffier the
pastry will be). Put the pastry
back in the bowl, re-cover
with cling film, and let it rest
another 20 minutes in the
fridge.
Easy-peasy, right? Almost as
easy as going to a shop and
picking a pre-made one from
the tens of options. Which
you can totally do, if you feel
like baking is a bit out of your
comfort zone or too much for
uni life.
While waiting for the dough
to chill, it’s finally the time
to start taking care of all
the nice things that wait for
you on the counter! Finally!
Before actually starting, you
might want to preheat the
oven (200-225 °C).
Chicken Pie
Slice the chicken breasts
into strips. Add the strips, the
butter and some olive oil to a
large pan and cook. Mean-
while, slice the (spring) onions
and the mushrooms. Add
them into the pan with the
mustard, one spoon of flour,
cream fraiche and chicken
stock. Stir and then leave to
simmer until tender.
After the mixture is sim-
mered, add it into a pan,
slightly smaller than the
pastry sheet. Cover the pan
with the pastry sheet. Quickly
beat the eggs and brush the
pastry all over. Put it in the
oven and let bake for 15
minutes, until golden.
Smash
Cook the carrots until tender
(enough to be easily cut with
a fork) in water with a pinch
of salt. When tender, drain
the water and smash them
using a potato masher, food
processor, or even a fork,
as we did. Yes, you might
need some brute force. While
doing this, you might want to
add a bit of olive oil.
Peas
Cut the lettuce as finely
as possible. Put the chicken
stock into a pot and add the
mint leaves and the flour and
whisk for a little while. When
it boils, add the chopped
lettuce and the peas. Season
with salt, pepper and some
lemon juice to taste. Let it
slowly cook for 10-15 minutes
(when the peas are soft
enough).
The final conclusion: no, we
were not capable of cooking
the food in just 30 minutes
and we ended up having a
really late dinner, but the
instructions were easy to
follow so everything ended
up being nice and simple
and, more importantly, FUN.
Yes, cooking is fun when done
with friends, so what about
you stop reading about it and
go for it!
P.S. You might want some-
one else to clean the pots and
dishes afterwards!
