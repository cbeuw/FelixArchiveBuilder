A
s rugby
players we
are all about
stash. By this
we usually
mean rugby
kit. However, this month
the focus is on cultivating
a different kind of
‘stache. A Movember one.
“Classic, another group of
people idly taking part in
a fruitless activity whilst
trying to justify it with
the pretence of charity,”
you think as you scan the
rest of the article, noting
the collage of ongoing
efforts. I simply moust-
ache you to wait. Whilst
growing facial hair will
make no difference to the
cause championed by the
Movember Foundation
(stopping men from dying
too young by fighting
testicular and prostate
cancer and preventing
suicide), spreading
awareness about the
issues and encouraging
donations will. So, I
encourage you to un-
stiffen that upper lip and
support this fan-tache-
tic cause! To support
the men’s rugby team’s
ongoing efforts, you can

reference, I need
something to fill
the void until
the next season.
But even that isn’t enough,
so it got me thinking. Maybe
I should try this swordplay
thing? And where better
than IC’s Fencing team? You
will have read about their
continued success in previous
editions but I’m not one to just
read about sports: I went. It’s
been a busy day, deadlines
to meet, papers to read and
a thesis that apparently won’t
write itself. Needless to say,
me with a weapon may be a
safety issue.
I went along to a Monday
night social session, where
beginners can come along
and be taught the basics by
experienced members of
the club. I’m welcomed by
the President who, after the
promise of biscuits to come,
introduced me to the poor
fellow whose job it is to run
me through the background
and basics. We start with a
short warm up, essentially a
glorified keep-away which
is entertaining and accentu-
ates the quick footwork I’ll
be requiring later on in the
say, this would be interesting.
I’m given some club-owned
equipment, which is provided
free for trainees. This is
a massive advantage for
those wanting to try fencing
out, a sport which could set
someone back a few hundred
pounds if you decide to invest
in your own kit. The acces-
sibility is impressive, but I’m
just delaying the inevitable
participation. I put on my
mask, a fetching jacket and
am handed an épée. I looked
good. Épée is a thrusting
weapon (calm down) and
so the point acts as a button
allowing a hit on any part of
the body to count. Guess it
was a bad day to wear shorts
and forget a cup.
I’m thrown straight in
against a member who prom-
ises he’ll go easy on me. I
clumsily salute, struggle to get
my mask on over my glasses
and enter the En Garde
position. We begin, I attempt
to remember footwork, but
my opponent strikes a point
while I’m looking at my feet.
I concentrate on keeping
the sword tip correctly
positioned and he strikes my
legs. It’s safe to say I closely
resembled an inebriated man
squaring up to a lamppost.
My opponent continues to
score multiple points without
batting an eyelid but I perse-
vere. Some feigned attacks
and lunges (helped by my six
foot height) score me a couple
of well placed points and I
start to find a rhythm with
the defensive and offensive
flow, a natural characteristic
of the sport. I lose 5-3 but I
find myself wanting to hone
my skills and try the other
weapons out, but alas my time
is up. I thoroughly enjoyed
my time as a fencer and I
encourage you to join the
club which has a strong roster
of experienced members on
hand. There’s a gentlemanly
manner to the sport you
wouldn’t see in most sports
and a constant stream of hints
and tips to help members
advance their ability. Yes you
need money for equipment,
but the club helps you out. Yes
it requires expertise but there
are plenty around who can
help you out. Yes you get to
attack fellow students without
repercussion but … OK, that’s
a good point but hopefully
you get the idea.
If you ever fancy giving
Fencing a go, get in touch
with the club via the union
website. En Garde!
session. Whilst the rest of
the beginners continue their
warm ups, I’m taken away to
expand on that footwork.
What followed was a whis-
tle-stop-tour of fencing terms
(all French, few remembered).
Feet must be positioned
perpendicularly, lead with the
dominant foot but lunge from
the rear, legs bent and no
room to take the Piste (fencing
pun intended). I get a sense
of the many years of history
behind the sport, where tradi-
tions of duelling are ingrained
into each fencer. My trainer,
Filip, is clearly enthusiastic
and explains each element of
the sport with gusto and clar-
ity. Around us, the members
of the IC team are battling
away in one of three weap-
ons: sabre, foil and épée. IC’s
success with this particular
sport comes as no surprise
with constant encourage-
ment and advice exchanged
between opponents.
The time comes for me to
wade into a fight of my own.
One thing you should know
about me, I would not hurt
a fly. Correction, I could not
hurt a fly. I’d happily let it
take my lunch money then
complete any of its outstand-
ing homework. Needless to

player, with the sound of
shivered timbers for miles
around. In all seriousness
we hope the Pirate was OK.
The two point conversion
was caught by Ben “Massive
hands” O’Brien who really
stepped up after being called
out by a coach, great game
for the kiddo and we look to
seeing many more.
The final score was 14-0
with a complete defensive
shut-down. We defend our
house. Next game is versus
Royal Holloway Bears.

I
t has been a rough road
for the IC Immortals,
recently relegated
from the highest tier of
American Football in the
country, to Division one.
Immortals have now had the
sweet taste of victory that had
been missed so dearly.
After a close overtime
defeat, Immortals were fearful
of a repeat of the previous
season. The idea that the
lower division would be a
cake-walk was shattered. The
fact that the team they were
playing, UEA Pirates, had just
come away with a convincing
victory over the RH Bears did
not help to settle their nerves.
UEA were predicted to win.
The game started off with
Immortals kicking off, the
Pirates received and were
stopped almost immediately.
This was a theme for the
rest of the game. UEA were
stopped at every attempt
to move the ball with
Panukorn “Nao Knee Teddy”
Taleongpong and Jack
“rumple-master” McCarthy
stuffing up any attempt at
running up the centre. When
they gave up on the middle,
Teddy (the Thai train), could
be seen coasting across the
field making big hits with
Daim “question-master” Tariq
blowing the Pirates offense to
pieces. Jason “no fly-zone”
Patrick Kuilan managed to
get two picks as linebacker,
statistics hail the man as a
beast.
It can’t be said that the
defensive side of the ball
was perfect, with a lot of
opportunities missed by
the Pirates’ offense. It can
be said that the Immortals’
offense missed out on a
lot more opportunities. It
was the rookie (not really
rookie, just new to Immortals)
offensive duo wide receiver
Aaron “don’t trust with
your daughter” Wilson
and quarterback Jason
“the human glitch” Patrick
Kuilan that stole the show.
A fantastic pass and insane
catch between the two got
the first touchdown of the
day. The next came with

L
ast weekend was the
opening bout of the
Imperial Women’s first
season at Oxford.
Unlike our other
teams, the Women’s
1s are in the Premiership,
which is the top league and
extremely competitive. In this
league it is usual to do all
the matches in two or three
intense weekends rather than
weekly. First up on Saturday
was Cardiff, which Imperial
won with an impressive
score of 130-107. The second
match was against local
rivals UCL, which Imperial
again won 131-113. The final
match of the day was against
Cambridge where Imperial
were narrowly beaten by only
nine hits, with an overall score
111-120. There was only
one match for the Women’s
1s on Sunday, against the
hosting team, Oxford, where
Imperial were unfortunately
beaten with an overall score
of 124-94. This means that
the Women’s 1s have won
two and lost two in their first
four matches, putting them in
a pretty good position going
into the match against last
year’s Championship winners
Surrey.
Well done to all the
team, especially to Maria
Constantinescu and Sherry
Xu for their first team debuts
(even if Maria did miss the
bus to Oxford after having
overslept). A special mention
also to Niamh Spence who
had her Imperial debut at
the weekend and fenced
tremendously, including a
14-5 win. Also a big thank
you to alumnus Zoe Robinson,
who made time to come down
to watch, coach and support
the team.
It wasn’t just the Women’s
1s in action over the weekend
though. In Manchester, Jamie
Simpson and Harry Peck
fenced in the Elite Épée event
at the Manchester Fencing
Centre. Jamie came 33rd
out
of 59 and Harry, fresh from
winning the Irish Open last
weekend, claimed bronze –
the third time he has done so
this season.
This week the fencing
teams start their cup
matches; the Men’s 1s are
fencing Cardiff at home,
alongside the 2s who face
City University and the
Men’s 3s are in action
against Brunel away. The
Women’s 2s are fencing
Cambridge 2s, also away.
