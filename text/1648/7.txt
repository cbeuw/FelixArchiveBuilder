said that “Arguing
that you don’t care

is no different than saying you

nothing to hide here at felix,
we have plenty to say.
Theresa May first proposed
the Communications Data
Bill (Snooper’s Charter) back
when there were Lib Dems
in power to swat it down.
But with the political she-
nanigans of the referendum
this June, May has been in
the perfect position to pass
through a spiritual successor.
The Investigatory Powers
Act passed last Thursday is,
to once again quote Edward
Snowden, “the most extreme

cies to carry out targeted
and bulk interception of
communications. It bans only
the tapping of MP’s phones
along with those of other
protected professions. It forc-
es Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) to hold on to a user’s

one year, e.g. google.com or
wikipedia.org, but not specif-

intelligence officers to see
these records without war-
rants. It allows police and
intelligence officers to hack
into specific devices and
bulk hack into equipment for
national security matters. It
puts in place legal obligation
for ISPs to help in the mass
data collection and hacking.
It makes it illegal for an ISP,
or someone working at one,
to reveal what data has been
requested. So you probably
don’t want to piss off that one
friend headed to Cheltenham
this summer.
Surprisingly, there is at least
one benefit to all of this: we
now have a far more accu-
rate picture of what GCHQ
is doing, and exactly what
acts they justify with the or-
ganisation-wide motto “Nec-
essary and Proportional”. I
don’t think I need to explain
why having a warehouse of
sensitive data on everyone
at a single location might not
be the best idea. Especially
given the impact of leaked
emails in the recent Ameri-
can election.
We still have no idea how
effective these kind of meas-
ures are for actually pro-
tecting against threats to

the British Board of Film

some hybrid of the Obscene

ers, including the amazing
“four finger rule” (four being
the maximum number of dig-
its allowed in an orifice).
You may not care about
your exotic pornography as
much as the felix editor, but
having a system in place to
gate or ban specific websites
based on their content is ter-
rifying. Porn is embarrassing,
and an easy starting place to
begin restricting what people
have access to.

Ultimately, what I find most
frustrating about this issue is
the idea that there are people
in Britain who are using the
drug with a total disregard for
the suffering that has gone into
getting it to them. Cocaine’s
glamorous façade makes it
a drug for the wealthy party
animals of the west. They are
rich, and the cost is irrelevant
– even if that includes human
lives. Untold misery goes into

f you haven’t already got
hooked on a Netflix series
then I would recommend
Narco’s – a fast-paced, no
frills, straight to the point
story of Pablo Escobar and
his cocaine empire. From the
get-go the audience is thrust
into the life of the world’s most
famous drug trafficker and
immersed in the brutality with
which he drowned the people
of Colombia.
Such horror followed the
route his cocaine took to reach
the USA, as the trail of drugs is
so often a bloody one. Now,
decades on and thousands of
miles away, it is interesting to
probe what the route of co-
caine to the UK looks like and
how much destruction it really
causes.
as simple as driving the prod-
uct up to a different continent.
There’s an ocean to cross.
Once crossed, the cocaine
arrives on the shores of West
Africa – a crucial transit point
in its journey. It’s estimated
that 18 tonnes of cocaine
pass through this area each
year en route to Europe. All
this amounts to a staggering
wholesale price of $1.25 bil-
lion (more than the GDP of
some West African countries),
so it’s no surprise trafficking
has become a dangerously
attractive market for people
here. The fact that West Africa
holds some of the poorest and
most politically unstable coun-
tries in the world has been
exploited, with Sierra Leone,
Guinea-Bissau, Ghana and
Benin being among the worst
affected nations. Corruption
is rife, security is weak, and
government resources are of-
ten surpassed by those of the
traffickers.
The industry is further fa-
cilitated by the Economic
Community of West African
States (ECOWAS). Allowing
free movement of people and
goods between these coun-
tries means that cocaine can,
in theory, move through the re-
gion relatively easily without
border controls. Traffickers
can also move between hubs
and conduct operations with
Much of the celebrity drug,
snorted by the likes of Nigella
Lawson and Kate Moss, still
comes from South America
(mainly Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia), as the problem was
never going to be eradicated
along with Escobar in 1993.
But the route to the UK is not
minimal interference.
An example of a country
plagued by the problems co-
caine brings can be seen in
Guinea-Bissau, a disputed
‘narco state’. Here, corrup-
tion runs from the very top

a good time, and countries are

advantage of traffickers and
their demanding customers.

norance. With further analy-
sis of certain cocaine users, I
wouldn’t be surprised if that
were true.
government politicians all the
way down to the police on
the ground. Those who are not
complicit can become casual-
ties of the trade – these peo-
ple include journalists, police,
military personnel and other
officials. Even the President
isn’t safe, with President Vieira
being assassinated in 2009 –
while his assassination was not
directly because of cocaine,
the drug played its part in rais-
ing tensions building up to the
event.
There is no shortage of ter-
rible acts of violence related
to the cocaine trade, often
affecting high profile, influen-
tial individuals. But in turn, it’s
the wider implications of such
acts that becomes increasing-
ly concerning. If politicians
and changemakers are being
bumped off left, right and cen-
tre, how on earth is a coun-
try supposed to govern itself,
let alone develop? Not only
can nothing ever get done in
government where anyone
who opposes the traffickers
is removed, but the people of
Guinea-Bissau cannot lift them-
selves out of poverty because
the cocaine industry crowds
out legal forms of economic
activity. Lack of legal business-
es and job creation then leads
to a poorly resourced govern-
ment, and it’s not as if they can
start taxing cocaine imports
for some kind of revenue. This
brings the country to a de-
moralising standstill whereby
legitimate globalisation and
self-improvement is thwarted
at every turn. And as is always
the case in these situations, it’s
