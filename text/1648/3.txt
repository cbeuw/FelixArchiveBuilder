Simone Buitendijk calls first ‘Town Hall’ meeting
Lef Apostolakis
I
mperial launched
its College-wide
consultation on the
Learning and Teaching
Strategy this Wednesday
with a Town Hall meeting
which saw Vice-Provost of
Education, Simone Buitendijk,
address the issues raised by
Imperial’s disappointing NSS
scores.
“All of us know that student
experience isn’t necessarily
one-on-one the best way for
measuring teaching quality,
but at the same time it is
important for being judged on
it. If you see similar categories
year after year after year
there are things you need
to pay attention to.” said
Buitendijk.
Indeed, Imperial College
has consistently done poorly
when it comes to the student
experience and this year
Imperial dropped from
number ten to 21 out of 24
Russell Group universities.
Many of the main issues that
plague student satisfaction at
Imperial are familiar to most
students and include density
of curriculum, a stressful
assessment process and
often poor-quality feedback
that doesn’t allow time for
reflection or improvement.
However, Buitendijk also
pointed out the inconsistency
of student satisfaction across
departments, which only
exacerbates the feeling of
discontent.
“Some students are
absolutely happy with the
teaching they’re getting. They
love their teachers, they rave
about the stellar researchers
that teach them and how
wonderful that is and other
students will have exactly
explain why some students
have a really good experience
and others don’t that really
leads to disgruntlement. I think
we see some of that in the
NSS,” said Buitendijk.
The strategy so far appears
to focus on a few key points.
Firstly, emphasis is put on
identifying the pockets of
good practice across various
departments, collecting them
and implementing them at a
College-wide level. Another
area of focus is curriculum
assessment. Buitendijk stressed
the importance of creating “a
curriculum that goes beyond
facts”, in an effort to equip
students with transferable
skills for “jobs that don’t even
exist yet”. Finally there will be
a push to restructure teaching
and learning by making
research-backed changes
that will elevate teaching to
match the level of the research
undertaken at Imperial. To
achieve these goals, there are
long-term plans to not only
develop education units that
research and assess Imperial’s
teaching strategies, but to
eventually create “central
units within faculties”.
“Ideally they’ll be
departments with professors
real time polling and a
panel discussion. During
the discussion, several
staff members voiced their
concerns.
Sam Cooper, an Imperial
graduate and currently an
Earth Science & Engineering
research associate, pointed
out that the problems the NSS
scores have highlighted are
widely known.
“We know that class
interaction has been the way
to go for a very long time...
It’s not as if we just found
out how teaching should be
done. We’ve known this for
a long time,” said Cooper.
“The academics on the whole
are reluctant to implement it
because it’s a lot of work...
I think it’s all very well
suggesting what we should
do, but how do you go about
persuading difficult-to-herd
academics to bother put in the
actual time?”
The Vice-Provost’s response
indicated that financial
incentives and training would
be used to promote these
changes. “...The teachers
who are going to do this will
get the support to take the
time out of other things. The
researchers will find this very
scary because it is scary to
step into something totally
new, especially if you have
little time for doing it anyway.
They need to get the proper
support, teaching fellows will
have to be involved and that
will take energy, manpower,
and ultimately budget.”
\\ It’s not as if we
just found out how
teaching should be
done. We’ve known
this for a long time \\
and chairs, but it’s a budding
field,” said the Vice-Provost.
“... it’s a long term goal that
we can keep in mind, that
would help in raising teaching
to the same level and prestige
as research.”
The Town Hall Meeting also
gave staff the opportunity
to share their thoughts
with College and Union
representatives through
opposite opinions. Some
students are completely crazy
about their personal tutor and
say that person really saved
their academic experience
and others say [they] really
lost out in the lottery for a
good personal tutor. They talk
to each other in halls, they
talk to students from other
universities and if we can’t
\\ They need to get
the proper support,
teaching fellows will
have to be involved
and that will take
energy, manpower,
and ultimately
budget \\
