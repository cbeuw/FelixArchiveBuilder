on December
4th, 1969, Fred
Hampton was
murdered in his bed. He
was killed in a police raid
with the assent of local
law enforcement, the state
government’s prosecu-
tor’s office, and the FBI.
He was 21 years old.
Hampton was a
member of the Black
Panther Party. Estab-
lished in 1966, the Black
Panthers were founded
as a reaction against
racist police brutality,
with the core practice of
“copwatching”, where
they formed an armed
citizens patrol to protect
each other from the police
and monitor police action.

“Emphasising
that class
solidarity
would be
the key to
lift people
from poverty,
whereas racial
divisions
would only
maintain
them”
at a time when the gov-
ernment was doing little
to economically empower
black communities, with
social programs including
free breakfasts for poor
children, after-school
programs, and community
health clinics.
Hampton joined the
Panthers in Chicago in
late 1968. He was instru-
mental in significantly
expanding the party’s
membership; he organised
weekly rallies, taught
regular political education
classes, and contributed
much to copwatching and
free breakfast programs.
Perhaps most significant-
ly, he brought Chicago
street gangs together to
form a non-aggression
pact, emphasising that
class solidarity would be
the key to lift people from
poverty, whereas racial
divisions would only
maintain them. He eventu-
ally became the chairman
of the Illinois chapter and
deputy chairman of the
entire Party.
This organising, and his
skills as an orator, made
Hampton a threat to en-
trenched power; J. Edgar
Hoover, 1st director of the
FBI and inveterate racist,
regarded him as an enemy
agitator, and had him
surveilled. At the same
time, the FBI fomented
mistrust among disparate
members of Hampton’s
“rainbow coalition” (the
multicultural political
group), sparking violence
and fracturing among
the different groups he’d
brought together. Even-
tually, they blackmailed
a convicted criminal,
William O’Neal, into
infiltrating the Chicago
Panthers, who supplied
them with the intelligence
in advance of the fatal
raid.
Hampton was drugged
by O’Neal on the evening
of December 3rd, and was
thus unable to react when
law enforcement stormed
the building he was in,
murdered one of his asso-
ciates, wounded him and
then shot him twice more
for good measure. His
partner, heavily pregnant,
had been sleeping next
to him and was forcibly
removed from the room
before his death.
I wanted to write about
change that huge govern-
ment agencies determined
he was a threat worthy
of elimination. Through
tenacity and strength of
will, Hampton changed
the equation of black lib-
ertation and social change
in Chicago. In doing
so, he made enemies,
just as Martin Luther
King, Thomas Sankara,
Mahatma Gandhi and so
many others did. Change
threatens people in power.
And though the reaction
against the Panthers even-
tually led to their disin-
tegration in the 70s, their
efforts resulted in black
Americans gaining a lot
of ground on civil rights,
and shined a spotlight on
various social issues that
had been hitherto ignored.
While the personalities
of individual leaders do
provide focal points for
movements, the strength
of these movements is
really in numbers.
In my mind, the most
significant lesson we can
learn from Hampton’s
story is that, if they could
achieve so much in the
face of poverty and perse-
cution, we should be able
to do even more from our
position of relative privi-
lege. The injustices and
issues we face now are
no less pressing than they
were then – economic in-
justice, climate injustice,
racial injustice. If they
could act then, we have no
excuse to fail to act now.
In Hampton’s words:
“if you dare to struggle
you dare to win, if you
dare not struggle, then
damn it, you don’t deserve
to win.”
this story for two reasons.
First, I think it’s impor-
tant that we understand
that no matter where in
the world you might be,
people with power are
capable of abusing it, and
that the government and
law enforcement don’t
necessarily have your best
interests at heart.
Second, I think there’s
something we can draw
from Hampton’s story,
and the positive albeit
short-lived impact he was
able to have in his commu-
nity. To me, it’s amazing a
21-year old could become
a focal point for organ-
ising significant enough
“His
organizational
role in Black
Panther, and
his skills as an
orator, made
him a threat
to entrenched
power”
They cited the law as a
defence when challenged,
eventually precipitating
strict gun control laws,
including in California
where the legislation
passed was supported by
then governor Ronald
Reagan. The Black
Panthers also organised
support for black citizens
