The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Seasons 1 and 2)
Before another binge session of the newly released Season 3, let’s take a walk down memory lane recapping the
first two seasons
A
mazon Prime
Video’s The
M a r v e l o u s
Mrs. Maisel is
a period comedy-drama
set in 1958 Manhattan,
New York. It follows
the self-discovery
journey of Mrs. Miriam
“Midge” Maisel, a house-
wife-turned-stand-up-co-
median. It’s created by
Amy Sherman-Palladino
who is best known for
creating the cult classic
Gilmore Girls. Since its
initial release in 2017, the
show has been well-re-
ceived, most notably
earning 34 Emmy nomi-
nations and winning 16.
Believe me, it’s definitely
worth every hype.
The premise begins
with Mrs. Maisel (played
by Rachel Brosnahan),
an upper-class Jewish
American housewife
whose husband has an
affair with his secretary
and leaves her, and
from there unexpectedly
stumbles upon a career
in stand-up comedy. The
story plays out as Mrs.
Maisel faces immense
pressure from her family
to return to the so-called
regular life all whilst
she shows herself in a
male-dominated industry.
There aren’t a lot of
elements but the few that
it has are fleshed out well
to always keep the plot in-
teresting enough to move
forward, coupled with
absolutely delightful char-
acters delivering witty
line after line. There’s
always something to look
forward to in the story, but
the highlight of the show
has to be the characters.
The character of
“Midge” is an interesting
one - it’s so natural to fit
every expectation of an
elegant 50’s lady without
being overly stereotypi-
cal. She is likable from the
very beginning - smart,
chatty, graceful, and
unbelievably hilarious.
Sherman-Palladino’s
sharp writing has molded
a multidimensional
character with incredible
one-liners, and Brosna-
han’s superb acting brings
this character to life. I
especially love how the
theme of feminism is
explored through the lens
of Mrs. Maisel, where
she seeks feminism not
“Social
movement
fueled by
simple
everyday
matter”
for the sake of it but is
rather motivated by her
passions. This perfectly
captures the essence of
the awakening social
movement fueled not by
sudden revelations but
simple everyday matter.
The supporting cast
also shapes this show in
many ways - I love how
each and every single
one of them is portrayed.
First I was beyond thrilled
when I saw Lenny Bruce
(played by Luke Kirby)
appearing in the first
episode. If you didn’t
know, Bruce is a well-
known stand-up comedian
of the time in real life. In
the show, Bruce serves as
a friend and champion of
Midge. I can understand
why Sherman-Palladino
could not resist incorpo-
rating such a character
- and I’m all for it. Second
of all Susie Myerson
(played by Alex Borstein)
is Midge’s manager;
every scene with both of
them is a definite laugh-
out-loud. Midge’s family
- her husband Joel (played
by Michael Zegen), Rose
Weissman (played by
Marin Hinkle), and Abe
Weissman (played by
Tony Shalhoub) all are
such fun and characteris-
tic roles that helps build
a necessary layer to the
show.
Another favourite
theme of mine explored
in The Marvelous Mrs.
Maisel is the idea of
“tragedy fuels comedy,”
which I feel like we have
all known all along but no
one really points it out.
Midge’s monologue hits
so close to heart and best
summarises the rising
genre of tragicomedy,
“Comedy is fueled by
oppression, by the lack
of power, by sadness and
disappointment, by aban-
donment and humiliation.
Now, who the hell does
that describe more than
women? Judging by those
standards, only women
should be funny.” This
is also exemplified by
Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s
Fleabag.
Last but not least, we
cannot have a review
of this show without
shedding light on its
outstanding costume
design. Let’s have a
round of applause for
the costume designer
Donna Zakowska, who
took the extra mile and
custom-made all of the
costumes to stay true to
the 50’s fashion. Midge’s

wardrobe stars the
timeless, classic “New
Look” silhouette that
accentuates the hourglass
figure with an emphasis
on the shoulder line and
the waist. I love Midge’s
top-to-toe rouge pink
outfit with a tea-length
dress and monochrome
coat and matching beret
and purse. Every detail
comes together to shape
to the role of Mrs. Maisel,
where through fashion
we can see how she’s
still putting her best foot
forward, embracing life
with confidence and cheer.
The third season pre-
mieres on December 6,
2019, on Amazon Prime
Video. It’s currently at the
top of my binge-watch list,
and I am in desperate need
of a healthy dose of the
fifties comedy, fashion,
and charm. To quote Mrs.
Maisel, “Thank you and
good night.”
