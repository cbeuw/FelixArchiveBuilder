Amnioverse: a perfect album listening experience
I
don’t think I’d be
offending anyone
by saying that most
listeners of elec-
tronic music focus more
on singles than albums.
When you listen to
Hybrid Minds or Bicep
you normally wouldn’t
play the whole album
start to finish. However,
there are electronic
albums that actively
work against this listen-
ing style.
Amnioverse is an
album that rewards
patient listeners. I’ve
gone through Amni-
overse probably over
20 times now and am
still enjoying the pro-
gression of motifs and
sonic themes. Lapalux
(aka Stuart Howard)
created this project
inspired by ideas of the
amniotic sac, creation
and the universe. Pretty
grandiose ideas, but he’s
not claiming he has the
answers. Stuart’s goal
was to create an album
where the evolution of
these ideas was explored
in a consistent flowing
narrative. “For me the
real focus was that the
whole record flowed,”
he says. ”I worked on
each song sequentially
and wouldn’t stop
working on a session
until they fitted together
and told the story that I
wanted to tell.”
The first track
“Oblivion” opens as
an introduction into
the world the album
inhabits. The sounds
used here persist and
adapt throughout. The-
matically, this opener
is the primordial ooze
from which the album
grows. Shifting into
the next track, “Voltaic
Acid”, the drums are
introduced. The beat
is volatile, unstable.
On a first listen almost
everything seems to
happen at random, but
the more you hear it the
more you find patterns
and repeated dynamics.
An erratic set of drum
fills will culminate in a
clear hit as the beat ebbs
and flows.
From track to track,
motifs are repeated but
are always developed.
An element from a
previous track will return
in a more contained and
precise way. “Earth” or
“The Lux Quadrant”
are perfect examples.
The few tracks prior to
both are wonkier, less
predictable and could
be (depending on your
taste) not as enjoyable.
But the introduction of
new sounds or the matu-
ration of old ones makes
for a more harmonious
listening experience.
In particular, “Earth”
becomes the perfect
microcosm of the tracks
prior, it’s the most
single-like track on the
whole album as it’s just
so darn lovely.
As though the spec-
tacular narrative, growth
and flow wasn’t enough,
all the other elements
of the album excel. The
production is so clean,
nothing sounds messy
or unintended. Despite
being few in number,
the voice samples used
are impactful and never
appear unless some-
thing is gained. There
are well choregraphed
peaks and troughs in the
energy of the album, it
never becomes boring.
Honestly I find it hard to
fault this album.
Amnioverse is the
current peak of Stuart’s
discography, and it
seems like a pretty
fitting way to finish off
the first decade of his
music career.
After a decade of Lapalux’s music we get an album
about creation... ironic, no? // Bandcamp

FKA twigs - Live
F
KA twigs’ gig
didn’t start until
9:30, by which
point a large
portion of the audience
frustrated, having waited
for over 2 hours. The
curtains raised bit by bit,
riling the crowd further.
“This show had better be
good” muttered someone
behind me, thankfully, it
was.
Twigs’ vocals were
often restrained, she
leaned on her backing
track throughout the
performance, typically
this would be a cause for
criticism, but here the
choice was artistically
motivated. FKA Twigs
unleashed her incredible
vocals at emotional
climaxes of songs, and
what a voice it is. Whether
whispering or reaching
angelic high-notes,
Tahliah Barnett’s voice is
a force of nature, leaving
concertgoers at Brixton
Academy in no doubt of
her vocal prowess, or the
passion behind the voice.
A vocal highlight came
which was a vulnerable
performance of ‘Mirrored
Heart’, where twigs’voice
trembled with emotional,
even stifling, sobs before
the final line “They just
remind me I’m without
you”.
An impressive element
of the performance was
that each song had been
tweaked, with drums and
percussion amplified as
well as extended instru-
mental sections allowing
for choreographed dances.
Rather than relying on a
backing track each instru-
mental was created by a
trio of musicians, playing
cello, electric drums
and a variety of other
instruments. The trio
resourcefully reconstruct-
ed each track with the
resources they had, giving
the audience a somewhat
fresh interpretation of
each track. Enough praise
cannot be given for this
approach, a laudable
effort from a primarily
electronic artist to keep
their live performances
organic and human.
Anyone familiar with
FKA twigs will be aware
she came into the world
of music as a dancer. With
a small team of backup
dancers, she executed im-
pressive routines featuring
Capoeira and at one point,
pole dancing. FKA twigs
rocked a series of ornate
costumes throughout the
evening, even the set
changed halfway through
the night, with a cloudy
backdrop falling to reveal
a scaffold like structure,
atop which her backing
band was playing.
FKA twigs added
impressive depth to her
tracks, creating one of the
best shows I’ve seen.
