Imperial Graduate CEO of Spyras Named UK’s Most
Promising Entrepreneur
George Winfield studied MRes Medical Device De-
sign and Entrepreneurship at Imperial and won both
the White City Innovators’ Programme in 2018 and
the Technology category of the Mayor of London En-
trepreneur awards in 2019. His entry was ‘Spyras’, a
paper-based breathing sensor used to reliably and
efficiently identify sepsis. He has since gone on to be
announced as the UK’s most promising young entre-
preneur by the Royal Academy of Engineering Enter-
prise Hub. Jack Powell caught up with him to gain an
insight into his journey with Spyras and his experience
with the Mayor’s Entrepreneur competition.

J: What are your
thoughts on being
named the UK’s most
promising young
engineering entre-
preneur?
G: It’s a very flattering title
to have been presented
with, but it’s all dedicated
to the team we have that
have sacrificed so much
in order to get Spyras
going. It is a strange
feeling reflecting back on
the student project, from
the aim of getting a good
grade to being on the
verge of creating some-
thing very special that
has gained international
attention. We can’t wait to
get it going.
J: What made you
decide to enter the
Mayor’s Entrepreneur
Competition?
G:What have I got to lose?
A simple application with
a chance to gain a national
title, and a massive cash
injection of £20k with
notable networks now on
offer.
J: How was your
experience in the
competition?
G: Very competitive.
There are so many im-
pressive businesses in
the student entrepreneur
scene. We had to get an
impressive business pitch
together and across in 2
minutes, with no slides,
in the middle of City Hall
(fans of The Apprentice
will know the place) to
a panel that included the
likes of Richard Reed
(Innocent Smoothies)
and Cassandra Stavrou
(Propercorn). It is an
incredibly lonely place to
stand in the middle of that
hall – but presenting to
the audience and having
the cameras live-stream
it just added to the expe-
rience. Being able to grow
your network during the
process and to have your
name mentioned at City
Hall is surreal.
J: How did you make
use of the City Hall
mentoring after win-
ning in 2019?
G: I meet quite regu-
larly with programme
managers at the Mayor’s
Office, who provide an
independent and impartial
view to bounce my ideas
off. To have that sounding
board and another
network, alongside the
Mayor’s Office to use, is
invaluable.
Applications for the
Mayor’s Entrepreneur
Competition 2020 close
on 22nd March. They’re
looking for students and
recent graduates with
smart ideas in one of four
categories: Environment,
Health, Smart Cities and
Creative Industries. You
could win £20k and men-
toring from the Mayor’s
Office to launch your
idea. City Hall is also
putting on a series of free
workshops for students to
find resources for generat-
ing ideas, meet potential
business partners, and
learn valuable pitching
techniques. The first one is
on 17th December – and
you don’t already need
to have an idea to come
along! If you’re interested
in entering or finding out
more details, send an
email to jp2517@ic.ac.uk
or search ‘Mayor’s Entre-
preneur Competition’ on
Google.

J: How did the initial
idea for Spyras come
to you?
G: The initial aim was to
get a good grade in my
masters to go on to a job
in finance or consulting!
The technology had been
concepted in the Guder
Research group and it
just needed someone to
take it to the next step
and commercialise it. My
research was to tailor a
novel, paper sensor-based
technology to monitor
breathing, and if possible,
to find a practical appli-
cation for this that could

have a genuine impact. It
seemed like a tough task,
especially since breathing
is such a difficult vital
sign to monitor. It has
more impact on our
general health and wellbe-
ing than you can imagine.
In a hospital setting, best
practice is for breathing
rate to be manually moni-
tored and counted. Unfor-
tunately, this is an entirely
unreliable exercise, given
that an elevated breathing
rate is one of the earliest
indicators of sepsis.
Sepsis is a condition
which, once it takes hold,
kills at a rapid rate. It
claims more victims than
breast, bowel, and prostate
cancer combined in the
UK. Spyras was founded
to meet the need for better
respiratory analysis, and
earlier identification of
this fatal condition. In
the course of researching
my thesis, I learned that
identifying the signs of
sepsis in patients has the
potential to save over
5,000 lives annually in
the UK and over £200m
in direct treatment costs
alone by preventing inten-
sive care unit admissions
