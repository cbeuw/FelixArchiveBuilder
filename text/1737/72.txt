Tragedy of the Commons: A Drama That Our Planet
Is Not Enjoying
Y
ou may have
heard of the
term tragedy of
the commons
before, or you may have
even studied about it. It
is an important economic
concept and is extremely
relevant to many of the
prevailing environmental
issues. The problem stems
from deep within human
nature and is at the heart of
corruption and exploita-
tion in this world. This
article aims to provide a
better understanding of
this issue, focusing on
the perspective of the
environment.
Tragedy of the
commons occurs when
there are common access
resources (CARs), natural
resources over which no
private ownership has
been established due to
the difficulty of excluding
people from using them.
CARs include forests and

pastures, fisheries, oil and
gas fields, grazing lands,
irrigation systems and
much more. To examine
one example further:
with the case of oceans,
it can be noted that their
bodies of water are so
incredibly vast that it is
impractical for one fishing
company to establish
control of an entire ocean
and stop others from
using it. Economists have
hypothesised that with
the lack of ownership
of resources, private
producers will act in their
own self interests and
exploit common access
resources to maximise
profit. This exploitation
is unsustainable, and will
lead to the depletion of
resources; this is known
as the tragedy of the
commons. In other words,
common access resources
provide an opportunity
for individuals to create
profit, while spreading
selfish beings is extreme
and grim, however, it
seems that this view is
correct in the case of
humans exploiting CARs.
Tragedy of the
commons is at the core
of a widespread range of
problems that are relevant
and threatening to natural
resources, environments
and human health. In
the case of overfishing,
fishing companies are not
responsible for the state of
the ocean, and continue to
fish as much as possible to
maximise revenue. Today,
90% of fish stocks are
depleted. Furthermore,
to save on fuel money
on their return journies,
fishing boats discard their
giant heavy nets into the
ocean, which has accumu-
lated to account for 50%
of ocean plastics. These
nets, known as “ghost
nets”, cause many animals
to become entrapped in
them and die.
Trawling is the
practice of dragging
large fishing nets across
the ocean floor, which is
extremely damaging to
marine habitat. Due to the
number of animals unin-
tentionally getting caught
in massive fishing nets,
there is a horrific practice
of discarding the uninten-
tionally caught animals
back into the ocean, even
if they’re dead. From the
point of view of a single
fisher, this is just what
they have to do in order
to be offered competitive
prices on the market and
compete with corpora-
tions engaed in unethical
business practices.
Another important
resource is forests. For
example, the Amazon is
considered to be the lungs
of the planet, but is cur-
rently being exploited and
deliberately burnt down
to make land for cattle
farming. In August alone,
there were 30,000 fires in
the Amazon, showing the
horrific nature of coop-
erate greed and extreme
consequences of resource
exploitation.
Clean air can be con-
sidered a common access
resource too, as everyone
have equal access. So,
unless you choke someone
(non-consensually, which
is very illegal), you can’t
exclude someone from
air. Companies have no
incentive of protecting
clean air, and will pollute
as much as they want
for their own gain. The
same is happening with
many clean freshwater
resources, which is being
polluted at alarming rates.
The same concept also
extends to the problem of
antibiotic resistance. This
is not a physical resource,
but abusing the use of
antibiotics is profitable
for farmers to boost pro-
duction and increase their
number of livestock. This
abuse leads to antibiotic
resistant superbugs for
which the consequences
are suffered by all of
humanity. Indeed, animals
in the US consume twice
as much antibiotics as
humans, this statistic
shows just how much
antibiotics are misused in
the farming industry.
The reason for such a
diverse range of problems
“The problem
stems from
deep within
human nature
and is at
the heart of
corruption and
exploitation”
“Amazon was
burnt down
for cattle
farming, which
demonstrates
the horrific
nature of
cooperate
greed.”
negative externalities to
everyone else. Indeed,
the economist view of
humans being completely
“Producers
will act in their
self interest
and exploit
those common
access
resources to
maximise
profit”
