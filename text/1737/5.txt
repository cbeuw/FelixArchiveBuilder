Pembridge Hall will be removed from the halls offering in 2020-21 // Neville Miles
These two changes to the
College’s accommodation
portfolio mean that 49%
of freshers will be living
in North Acton next year.
The year before the North
Acton halls opened to stu-
dents, it was decided by
the Union that the price
per square meter of North
Acton rooms versus non-
North Acton rooms would
be 1:2; accounting not
only for the distance and
travel costs incurred when
travelling from North
Acton to get to class, but
also ensuring that there
was some sort of afforda-
ble accommodation on
the portfolio.
While the total revenue
generated from rent must
comply with an overall
model decided by the
College, the distribution
of rent price across halls
and rooms is delegated
to the Union. With a
changing accommodation
portfolio, on top of the
proposed 12.2% rent
hike, things get much
more complicated. In the
original paper brought to
Council, the Union Presi-
dent and Deputy President
(Welfare) laid out four
potential options for how
this 12.2% increase could
be distributed across
North Acton and South
Kensington halls (any hall
that is not in North Acton
is considered to be South
Kensington-centric).
These options ranged
from a flat increase of
12.2% across all halls, to a
20% NorthActon increase
and 8% South Kensington
increase. The decision on
price distribution largely
depends on balancing the
availability of affordable
housing options for
first-year students whilst
simultaneously avoiding
splitting the fresher cohort
into North Acton/South
Kensington communities
that have large wealth
disparities. First-year
halls are crucial to build-
ing a community where
the student body is well
integrated and everyone
feels a sense of belonging;
this would be incredibly
difficult to achieve if the
price gap between South
Kensington and North
Acton halls were to grow
much larger, which would
essentially segregate stu-
dents by wealth.
Though the 12.2%
hike was ultimately voted
down by Union Council,
College is under no real
obligation to comply
with this decision. Union
President Abhijay Sood
has said about the Coun-
cil’s rejection of the rent
hike, "The preference
of College Campus Ser-
vices would have been
for Union Council to
accept their break-even
model, and endorse one
particular version of what
they put forward. Union
Council did not feel that
they could endorse that,
and Shervin (Deputy
President (Welfare)) and
I did not personally feel
we could endorse that
because of how steep the
proposed increases are.
We went back to them
and they have expressed a
willingness for us to work
together to get through
this impasse.
“We have established
that we have a lot of
common ground - we
all want to reach an
agreement, we want to
agree something and to
do so in a relatively tight
time frame, and we want
students to be treated
fairly and for as many
students as possible to live
in halls as a first-year, as
it's very positive for the
student experience. We
also all want the College
to be financially solvent;
we don't want the Col-
lege's finances to be bad,
because that damages stu-
dents too. This common
ground, we can use to
proceed. We won't be
giving minute-by-minute
updates because it would
be unfair on both us and
College, but we really do
believe an agreement can
be reached, and if it can
then we will be bringing
that agreement back to
Union Council on January
21st as a public meeting.”
accommodation in these
halls as returning students
because of their proxim-
ity to campus. Students
asserted that any further
price hike would be unjust
because they are not living
in these halls by choice,
but rather because their
conditions necessitate
them to.
There was also discus-
sion about how the price
of rent could be subsidised
for Hall Seniors, who
currently take on the role
entirely on a voluntary
basis. This has been in
discussion for a while; in
a session held last year
by the previous Deputy
President (Welfare) Becky
Neil, hall seniors were
asked how the Union and
College could show their
appreciation for the work
that they do, and some of
the suggestions included
a 10% rent subsidy. The
Council voted in favour
of reducing rent for Hall
Seniors, but with no
further specifics given the
rejection of the overall
model and the necessity
for further negotiation
with the College. Also
passed by Council was a
decision to slightly reduce
the rent of several rooms
on the Lower Ground
floor in Southside and
Eastside, whose windows
faced a wall and meant
they received extremely
limited sunlight.
AftertheUnionCouncil
session ended, Felix and
ICTV interviewed stu-
dents as well as Council
representatives about their
view on the rent increase
and the breakeven model,
the video of which will be
released on Felix’s Face-
book page as part of their
"Lifting the Rock" series.
There was broad consen-
sus about the importance
of rent price in choosing
first-year accommodation,
corroborating the idea that
the North Acton/South
Kensington price gap is a
fairly sensitive issue that
the Union must handle.
The Council session itself
was live-streamed and the
full video can be found on
the Union Facebook page.
The College did not
accept a request for
interview, but a College
spokesperson did
comment: “we are con-
tinuing our conversations
with the Union on a rent
framework agreement so
we can keep providing
high quality and fairly
priced accommodation for
our student community.”
“It is possible
that without
the new
included costs,
rent would not
have to rise”
“We believe an
agreement can
be reached,
which would
be brought
back to Union
Council on
January 21st
”
With a 12.2% rent
hike, the price of living
in halls is no longer much
different from the market
rate of real estate. A single
room in Beit, which cur-
rently costs £235/week
would be projected to cost
£264/week following a
flat 12.2% increase.
Also discussed at
Union Council was the
unfairness of the rent in-
crease for students living
in Eastside/Southside/
Beit, not because of
preference but because
of health conditions.
