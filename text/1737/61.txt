Top Picks of the Year. Time to get Hyped!
“The Outer
Worlds has
to take the
cake for me...
it really allows
you to play the
game any way
you want”
“The Outer
Wilds is an
indie game,
but it doesn’t
feel like it.
It has such a
massive scope”
– take notes Bethesda.
This also seems to be
the general opinion, at
least online. The Outer
Worlds is a recent smash
hit, leading me to think it
Narrative
“For outstanding
storytelling and narrative
development in game.”
Nominees: A Plague
Tale: Innocence, Control,
Death Stranding, Disco
Elysium and The Outer
Worlds. This category
highlights games that
show that gaming itself
can stand out as its own
creative medium. I am
torn with my choice;
while A Plague Tale:
Innocence has some great
narrative moments, the
epic cinematic feast that is
Death Stranding is equally
tempting me. The Outer
Worlds is also a strong
contender, but much of
the narrative is controlled
by your own choices,
which I don’t consider as
actual “story-telling”. I
think that Death Stranding
is likely to win this award.
Despite coming out only
recently, it is such an
anticipated game, and
considering how dull the
gameplay can be at times,
the fact that people still
play really just shows the
strength of the story that
much more.
Multiplayer Game
“For outstanding online
multiplayer gameplay and
design, including co-op
and massively multiplayer
experiences, irrespec-
tive of game genre or
platform.”
Nominees: Apex
Legends, Borderlands
3, Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare, Tetris 99, Tom
Clancy’s The Division 2.
I do not play many
multiplayer games. I
much prefer to spend
my time delving into a
deep single player world
at my own pace. But I
will always have a soft
spot for Tetris and Tetris
99 hooked me from
day one. A battle-royale
Tetris game seemed like
an insane concept, but it
really, really works and I
absolutely love it. Apex
Legends and Modern
Ware have the mass
appeal, especially Apex
legends with the millions
of players that it brought
on within a couple days.
I feel as though Apex
legends will take the
award simply from how
successfully it managed
to make an impact in the
market despite it already
being flooded with games
like Fortnite and PUBG.
Mobile Game
“For the best game
playable on a dedicated
mobile device.”
Nominees: Call of
Duty: Mobile, Grind-
stone, Sayonara Wild
Hearts, Sky: Children
of the Light and What
the Golf. I do not have
much to say about this, I
am fond of some mobile
games but I do not play
them much and the only
one listed here that I have
played is Grindstone. It is
an oddly satisfying and
highly addictive game to
pull out on the train, but
I don’t see many people
discussing it. If I had to
guess on the winner, I
would say Sayonara Wild
Hearts, simply because
out of all of these games,
it is the one with the most
nominations.
Indie Game
“For outstanding
creative and technical
achievement in a game
made outside
The traditional publish-
er system.”
Nominees: Baba is you,
Disco Elysium, Katana
Zero, Outer Wilds and
Untitled Goose Game.
Indie games are a uni
student’s best friend. They
don’t take up too much
time and they are rela-
tively cheap. These are
all amazing contenders
and it is very, very hard
to choose between them.
Baba is you is so unique,
Disco Elysium and Outer
Wilds are beautiful,
Untitled Goose Game is
bloody hilarious. I would
choose Outer Wilds
though. It is an indie game
but it does not feel like an
indie game. It has such a
massive scope that I didn’t
realise it was by an indie
developer when I first
played it. Unfortunately, I
think it will be overshad-
owed by Untitled Goose
Game. Goose Game took
the internet by storm and
everyone, even non-gam-
For the first time, a remake (Resident Evil 2) appears as one of the nominees. Do you think it can win it all?// Nintendosoup
is going to win. Although
one cannot forget Monster
Hunter or Final Fantasy
XIV, both which have
very large fan bases that
have easily sunk 1000s of
hours into their respective
games.
