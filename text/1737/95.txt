ICHC Ladies 2s Reach the top of their league
I
t has been a term of
change for the ICHC
L2s. The previous
few seasons saw a lot
of defeat, with moments
of greatness and unbeat-
able team spirit, but just
not many actual goals.
Something had to change,
and so October brought
the hotly debated creation
of the L3s, led by the blin-
dingly optimistic captain
Lois Gallety and devoted
coach Milo Kite. We were
also pleased to welcome
several skilled freshers
who are not above occa-
sionally stepping on the
ball or giving away a pass
out of confusion/panic
– too scruffy for the L1s,
but perfect for the L2s.
After several exciting
weeks of matches, we got
to know each other and
were making great strides
on and off the pitch. A
mid-November LUSL
match against Kent 1s,
a team several leagues
above us, had been a little
rough, but hopes were still
high as we came to face
the only other undefeated
team in our BUCS league,
RUMS 2s.
This was to be “the
most important game
of the season” – Alex
Bosman, co-captain. As
ICHC’s L2s pulled into
the penultimate stop
on the Piccadilly Line,
Katya was nervous. But
with Ash ‘did you know I
played county when I was
13’ Cunningham in goal,
and Ellie ‘Sorry I just
feel so distracted today
aha’ Dobson as sweeper,
we knew we were in safe
hands, and Katya was a
bit less nervous (but still
quite nervous).
An unusually smooth
start and some divisive
attacking play by freshers
Ella, Charlotte, and Millie
saw us with a few slick
goals by half time.
Some rocky play in the
second half, with players
either falling over from
stationary or misunder-
standing the umpire’s
words “please put the
ball on the line” had us
lose some momentum,
but at this point we were
just pleased to know most
of the rules. An unlucky
breakthrough in the final
minute saw RUMS score
their first goal, but not
before we had slipped in
a few more, ending the
match with a comfortable
6-1. All in all, a capti-
vating performance by
everyone collaboratively
and individually (“except
Ash” – Henry Sewall,
Coach), with inspiring
teamwork and drive that
is set to only get better as
the season continues.
After a tough 18/19
season saw us struggling
with consistency and low
in spirits, it is exciting to
see such brilliant chemis-
try and smooth technical
play that begs the question
- is promotion finally
within reach?

Imperial Octopush battle it out in Oxford
O
n Saturday 30th
November, the
Octopush team
(also known as
Underwater Hockey or
UWH) played their first
competition of the year at
the University of Oxford.
For the few people
reading this who don’t
already know, Octopush
is a game created in 1954
by scuba divers to help
them let off some steam
(without damaging any of
their incredibly expensive
equipment). They devised
a game where teams
would attempt to push a
weighted puck into a goal,
all while holding their
breath underwater. The
game is ‘limited’ contact
and involves ten players,
with six in the pool at
any one time and four
as substitutes. Players
also don a glamorous kit
which includes a snorkel,
mask, fins, a delightful
hat, plus some specially
made sticks that allow the
player to manoeuvre the
puck.
Although UWH is a
very well-known sport in
the UK, people often don’t
realise that it is interna-
tionally played, with com-
petitions hosted globally
and attracting a diverse
range of people (although
the game still hasn’t made
it to BUCS yet). In fact,
the game’s international
history stretches as far
back as the first world
championship in Canada
in 1980. The main reason
the sport hasn’t reached
Olympic status is the huge
engineering challenges
involved in making the
sport crowd-friendly.
Ideas have included a fully
glass pool or a submerged
spectator stand, however
so far neither one has
gained huge traction (es-
pecially after the terrible
UWH Glass Disaster of
2001 where three players
lost their lives). Although
the imperial team isn’t
quite at an international
level presently, it’s defi-
nitely something that’s
on the agenda for coming
years!
So who is your average
underwater hockey
player? Well, generally
speaking, UWH players
derive great pleasure
from the niche, edgy,
and aggressive nature of
the sport. The game is
surprisingly fast paced
and often involves some
ramming and the odd
sneak attack by a fin or
stick. The wonderful
thing about underwater
hockey is that collisions
underwater usually lead
to much lower injury rates
than ‘above-the-water’
sports. Of course, risk
of drowning is definitely
increased compared to
say field or ice hockey….
but generally your team-
mates/the other team
don’t actually want to kill
you and will come to your
aid if need be.
The most recent
tournament was last
Saturday’s competition
in Oxford. It was against
several other UK univer-
sities including Oxford,
Warwick, Plymouth,
and York. The Imperial
team successfully won
their first two games…
and then promptly lost
the next four. However,
the six-person team was
also lacking any substi-
tute players, meaning a
stream of relentless games
with almost no breaks
in between. Ultimately,
Imperial battled hard
(and accidentally made a
player on one team cry),
so all in all it was a hugely
successful first compe-
tition. The team is now
looking forward to their
next competition and the
student nationals in 2020.
Imperial’s UWH team
trains at Ethos pool every
Thursday evening. Get
