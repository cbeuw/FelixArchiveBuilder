The Rise and Fall of Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats
POLITICS

S
ix months ago,
British politics
seemed poised
for upheaval. The
Liberal Democrats, stand-
ing on an unambiguously
pro-remain platform, se-
cured a higher vote share
than both Labour and the
Conservatives in the EU
elections. The overall vic-
tory however, had gone to
the equally unambiguous
Brexit Party. One YouGov
poll showed voting inten-
tion in almost a 4-way split
between these parties. The
received wisdom at the
time claimed that the EU
Question had irrevocably
changed the face of our
political discourse – and
yet now, as we barrel to-
wards a General Election,
a kind of familiarity is
returning. Hard-Brexiters
have fallen in line behind
Boris Johnson, and so the
Brexit Party vote share has
unsurprisingly collapsed.
But what happened to
the Liberal Democrats,
who also seem to be in
freefall? Why are voters
fleeing them in droves
when, at least by their
own estimation, there is
no alternative Remain
party?
The most essential
weakness of the Lib
Dems is their leader - Jo
Swinson. Polling has
shown that remarkably,
the more voters see of
her, the more they dislike
her – even among Remain
voters – with her approval
dropping significantly
after each major debate
and television appearance.
This would be incredibly
damaging for the leader of
any party, but particularly
for one that has made its
Following success in the EU elections and a pro-remain Brexit stance, why does support for the Liberal Democrats
seem to be dwindling?

“The most

leader a central feature of
their branding. The party
frequently refers to itself
as ‘Jo Swinson’s Liberal
Democrats’, and its man-
ifesto as ‘Jo Swinson’s
Plan for Britain’s Future’.
One of their recent
rallies even featured a
‘Swinzone selfie zone.’
Every election from
1992 to 2015 saw the Lib
Dem’s vote share increase
over the campaign. This
trend was bucked in 2017,
under the leadership of the
useless (and quietly hom-
ophobic) Tim Farron, and
so it seems to be again, as
Jo Swinson withers under
the light of scrutiny. The
Lib Dem brand, built atop
Swinson’s personal popu-
larity, appears now to be
sinking like a house built
on sand.
The Lib Dems have
also faced challenges not
of their own creation –
victims of several widely
shared ‘fake news’stories.
The mostly prolific of
these was a fake Mirror
story (by a ‘Wurrence Tel-
ephene’) which claimed
that a video had emerged
of Swinson firing stones
at squirrels (or ‘pleb
bunnies’, as she was
alleged to have referred to
them). Swinson has since
publicly denied that she
enjoys killing woodland
creatures for fun. A more
recent fake story emerged
in the form of tweets by
a ‘Max Gapes’ which
claimed that Swinson
was considering resign-
ing before the election,
and that senior Lib Deb
figures had already
attempted to discuss a
coalition agreement with
the Conservatives. These
tweets, painting a picture
of a party in total disarray,
were shared by senior
Labour Party figures, but
then promptly debunked.
For a party victimised
by, and so strongly
opposed to, fake news,
the Lib Dems have come
under heavy criticism for
circulating fake infor-
mation of their own. The
widely derided ‘Lib Dem
bar charts’, a recurring
tactic of misrepresenting
polling or historic election
data to exaggerate their
own electoral chances,
have been out in full force
this cycle. The party’s
head of media was also
suspended over allega-
tions that she fabricated
an email in attempts to
discredit a negative
news story. Many voters
flocked to the Lib Dems
after being frustrated and
disaffected by the Leave
campaign’s deployment
of misinformation, so the
party’s own failings in this
area will have contributed
to pushing away these
voters.
The Liberal Democrats’
failure to retain a loyal
base of Remain voters
can also be explained,
counterintuitively, by
their extreme Brexit
policy of revoking Article
50 (i.e. cancelling Brexit
without any additional
referendum). Jo Swinson
has struggled to justify
this policy on multiple
TV debates, with many
Remain voters criticising
this policy as too extreme,
undemocratic, and too
alienating of Leave voters
to have any chance of
success. It does not help
that the party’s main
defence of this policy
has been that they would
only enact it if they won
a majority (implicit in this
statement – that it is rather
unlikely). So why even
bother voting for them?
The party which long
championed the ‘People’s
Vote’ seems to have shot
itself in the foot by aban-
doning it.
With polling day
imminent, only time will
tell whether the Lib Dems
will be able to recapture
some of the support they
formerly enjoyed. The
party hopes to be the
kingmakers of a hung par-
liament, but to reach this
position they will need
more than the humble
13 seats predicted by the
YouGov MRP model.
And if they do, will they
break their promise not
to put Jeremy Corbyn
in Number 10? Or will
they once again back the
Conservatives (perhaps in
exchange for a referendum
on Boris’ Hard Brexit)?
And will Jo Swinson be
able to hang onto her
East Dunbartonshire
seat, which the SNP are
striving to retake? Only
one thing is certain – the
once expected Lib Dem
‘surge’ has emerged as
little more than a trickle.
