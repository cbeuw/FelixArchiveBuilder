Impartiality and the Rent Debate
I
've had a long debate
with myself about
whether to write this
Editorial or not.
I view my role in the
College community, as
Felix Editor, as being
somewhat of a 'fly on the
wall' - observing, but re-
maining neutral; offering
opinion on occasion via
this column but only on
a holistic basis, rarely
on specific controversial
issues. I am not given a
vote on Union Council -
the only sabbatical officer
not to have one, in fact
- because my remit is spe-
cifically not to advocate
or represent students, but
rather to run this paper
with unbiased integrity.
It's a hard balance to
strike - my position gives
me insights into aspects
of College and student
life, decision-making,
experiences, and so on,
and I feel a duty to share
that. However, I have no
desire to risk what I hope
is a commonly held per-
spective: that I genuinely
attempt to be as impartial
and balanced in my inves-
tigations and reporting as
possible.
On the halls rent debate,
I feel that some will feel
that the reporting is not
balanced. To an extent,
that is the result of a dearth
of engagement from the
College side. I cannot
share the perspective of
someone who will not
speak to me. Fortunately,
prior to now, I have found
everybody in the Union
and College to be highly
forthright in speaking to
me as a reporter from the
student paper. I did not
expect that entering the
role, and highly respect
it. This is the first time
I am navigating these
particular waters: how
to report fairly when one
side remains silent, and
your information is driven
by fewer sources.
In this Editorial, I want
to offer a personal opinion
and some thoughts on how
this situation came to be.
I will say now: I do not
think that the proposal
offered by College in-
itially was reasonable,
for a variety of reasons.
According to the infor-
mation I have, it cannot
possibly be considered
a genuinely 'break-even'
model. There are a series
of very tough questions I
believe the College need
to ask themselves when
assessing the financial de-
velopment of their model,
on the monetary end of
things, and on the proce-
dural. There appear have
been clear and gaping
oversights in the way this
model was constructed.
This was not a mali-
cious act - of that I am
convinced. People are
generally not bad, either
as people or at their
jobs. Rarely is a whole
division bad at either or
both. Instead, I personally
suspect it stems from
the eternal disconnect
between those making
the decisions and those
affected by them. It comes
from a failure to have the
right people in the room
when decisions are being
made.
The metric by which
this model was assessed to
be reasonable was not suf-
ficient. As I understand it,
a benchmarking exercise
was undertaken, in which
the proposed rents were
compared to other halls
across London. They were
in the same range, and so
the College considered
the offer reasonable.
This is an Excel spread-
sheet exercise.
No student would
ever be mollified by that.
Had they been in that
room, there are so many
points they could have
raised much earlier in the
decision-making process
- points which, inevitably,
were immediately raised
by students the second it
was put to them. Quali-
tative points, about how
deeply and irrevocably
student welfare and com-
munity at this university
would be affected. We do
not want a wealth-seg-
regated community. We
do not want to price the
poor out of halls, or out
of attendance at the uni-
versity. Neither does the
College, of course - but
the difference is that these
issues are the primary and
immediate concern for
students, whereas natural-
ly they are secondary con-
siderations for those who
are not directly affected.
It is immediately apparent
to the former, while the
latter might miss it.
There is an argument
to be made that this is the
point at which consulta-
tion occurred - I realise
that. However, much of
the resource and invest-
ment into this model has
been wasted (speaking on
the assumption that the
College will amend the
model based on ongoing
discussions.) Addition-
ally, the College has
garnered ill will with the
student body when it was
just completely avoidable
and unnecessary if they
were willing to involve
the right people in their
decisions from the get-go.
This isn't the only
situation in which this
occurs. Another example:
funds were wasted at
White City when vital
equipment or labs had
to be moved after it was
discovered the original
location was too close to
the train tracks, rendering
the equipment useless
due to vibrations. This is
something researchers in
that lab would notice long
before those who were
making the decisions -
naturally, as it is their area
of expertise.
Having the right people
in the room from the start
requires a lot of work
in restructuring the way
power and decision-mak-
ing agency are distributed
and managed. It also
requires a lot of trust and
collaboration. There's a
lot of anger and damaged
trust between various
communities here already,
so that will take time to
amend. But we have to
start trying to.
People are not bad,
money-hoarding socio-
paths. Students are not un-
realistic or entitled. This
angry, dismissive rhetoric
needs to be supplanted by
a common identity and a
genuine desire to move
forward and address the
underlying systems that
currently are not function-
ing in a way that actually
benefits us.
