Troy: Myth and Reality
L
egend has it that
the goddess of
discord threw
a golden apple
into a crowd, bearing
the inscription ‘for the
most beautiful’. It was
claimed by three god-
desses, Athena, Hera and
Aphrodite, and Zeus asked
The Trojan prince Paris to
make the final judgement.
He chose Aphrodite, who
promised him the most
beautiful woman in the
world. This woman was
Helen, wife of the Greek
king Menelaus. who Paris
stole away from Greece
and across the sea begin-
ning the siege of Troy.
During the war, atrocities
were committed on both
sides but ultimately, the
Greeks conquered the
great city of Troy with the
cunning use of the Trojan
horse and the ferocity of
the hero, Achilles.
The myth of the Trojan
war has been told for over
3000 years and continues
to inspire people today. It
was first told by word-of-
mouth, then immortalised
in Virgil’s Aeneid as well
as Homer’s epic poems,
the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Now, it is told through
plays, operas, film and
Troy: Myth and Reality.
The exhibition at the
British Museum focuses
not only on the history of
the myth but explores the
story in a rich and con-
clusive study. Patrons are
first invited to question
whether Helen loved Paris
or was merely a captive.
There are different inter-
pretations in art and the
influence of the Gods is
central to this, with many
versions of the story
depicting Paris and Helen
as pawns in Zeus’ plans.
A large space is dedicated
to Achilles as both a
courageous war hero and
a monster, murdering and
defiling his enemies. The
fall of Troy is particularly
interesting with its depic-
tions of the Trojan horse
and the tale of Aeneas,
who escapes the burning
Troy to later become the
founder of Rome. The
exhibition goes as far as to
cover the aftermath of the
war, including the travels
of Odysseus and his return
to his wife, Penelope. In
this section, attention is
drawn to the fantastical
beasts featured in Homer’s
works; the sirens and sea
monsters are shown in
works from the time but
also in popular culture
from more modern origin,
revealing a fascination of
Greek myth to this day.
We also learn of the ar-
chaeological discoveries
made around Troy and
touchingly, parallels are
made between the Trojan
war and modern war and
crisis.
The collection is im-
pressive in both quality
and quantity, showcasing
stunning marble sculp-
tures, engravings, paint-
ings, pottery and original
items from ‘Priam’s
treasure’. However, due
to the limited exhibition
space and intense popular-
ity, the exhibit can become
very crowded. I found that
I had to essentially fight
my way to read exhibit
captions, which were
poorly placed at ground
level. Although the visit
may be slow-going, this
does not detract massively
from the installation and
it was worth attending to
witness the reconstruction
ofAchilles’shield, ancient
transcripts of the Iliad and
far more.
The Wind of Heaven: From Bethlehem to Blestin
T
he greatest ob-
jection to God
has always been
emotional. While
it is true that the debate
over divine non-presence
is clothed in the mild-
breathed language of
logicism and rationality,
what stirs in us feeling
enough to slacken faith
and scorn perdition is the
atrociousness of evil and
suffering - the feeling that
an all-kind, omniscient,
and omnipotent God
couldn’t possibly exist
alongside mothers that
must bury their children.
It’s a powerful argu-
ment. The Wind of Heav-
en entertains this notion:
its central characters, con-
sciously or not, grapple
with the limits of mor-
tal life and all the whips
and pangs therein. The
play is centred just out-
side the Welsh mountain
village of Blestin, which
lost its children a decade
ago in an accident of un-
imaginable cruelty, and
sets itself in the aftermath
of the Crimean war - the
mountain hospital over-
flows with maimed sol-
diers, the threat of cholera
and typhus never far off.
Confronted with such suf-
fering, and with a modern,
godless capitalism loom-
ing over the not-too-dis-
tant horizon (represented
here by a fast-talking nou-
veau-riche Birmingham
businessman who owns a
circus named after him-
self), it’s only understand-
able that the village has
no vicar and the church is
now a post office.
But then Jesus comes
to Blestin in the form of
a Welsh teenage peasant.
As a widow struggles to
contain her grief and our
Birmingham business-
man confronts his past,
the village erupts in a re-
ligious revival over a boy
who can cure the sick and
raise the dead. The Wind
of Heaven fundamentally
concerns itself with the
power faith has to trans-
form, heal and revitalise
- and the production does
an excellent job of depict-
ing the emotional growth
religion stirs in its charac-
ters (that the Finborough
Theatre is such an inti-
mate venue only height-
ens the experience).
And yet it feels like
a cheat: the play’s pow-
er is co-opted from the
reverence which even to-
day we offer to, say, the
quiet and cold stalls of a
church, rather than be-
ing generated internally.
Upon the interval, after an
achingly beautiful Welsh
hymnal, I was as ready to
preach the gospel as any
man alive, but I couldn’t
help thinking that a good
sermon would have pro-
voked the same response.
In fact, it’s a double cheat
- by having Jesus raise the
dead and cure the sick, the
play fails to meaningfully
respond to the problem of
suffering; even the play’s
Doubting Thomas, who
argues that the whole fer-
vour is just a case of mass
hysteria, can only provide
strawman arguments. This
a didacticism, not a dia-
lectic.
And yet I can’t write
off the play so easily. The
production’s well staged,
and that the script serves
some dubious lines in its
religious crusade is only
a credit to the cast who
pull them off. If this feels
like damning with faint
praise, it is, but not in
the way you think: for all
this, I couldn’t help but be
moved by the production,
and I’m still chewing on
it. If I can’t make a ration-
al argument for you to see
this, I can certainly make
an emotional one.
