How Computers took our music away
Following the brief histories of jazz and rock, Felix now takes a look at the history of electronic music
P
utting the history
of a whole genre
of music to paper
is a mammoth
task, especially for
a genre as fluid and
diverse as electronic
music, so please forgive
any oversight I may
have made in trying to
accomplish it. It is a story
of technical innovation,
experimentation, and of
people coming together.
Laying the
groundwork
Music has always been
an art-form whose bound-
aries have been set by
the tools that musicians
had at their disposal.
500 years ago, medieval
towns would wait for
ages for troubadours
to swing by to dish out
some simple harmonies.
In the following centu-
ries, music played on
carefully crafted instru-
ments remained a luxury
contained in swanky
ballrooms, danced to by
old men with powdered
faces and wigs.
The explosion of
popular music (music
for the PEOPLE) in the
20th century coincided
with the new-found
mass-production of
instruments, which made
them affordable. This un-
precedented availability
of music for the people
meant that instruments
were no longer only a
medium for routinised
recitals of age-old melo-
dies but also a platform
for experimentation. The
tried and tested was to
be eschewed for fresher
sounds, something which
both the spirit of jazz,
which took off long be-
fore electronic music, and
atonal chamber composi-
tions, whose composers
began to rise at the turn
of the 20th century, laid
the foundations for.
Early experimentation
with electronic music was
limited to creative uses of
the newly invented elec-
tric tape. This allowed for
layering of instruments in
a different way (now not
solely by synchronous
playing), controlling
the speed and pitch of
the sounds, and overall
showed a glimpse that
electronic recording of
analogue sounds allowed
for creation of sounds
that traditional instru-
ments couldn’t fashion.
This was followed by the
invention of sine-wave
oscillators, modulators,
filters, mixers, and a
whole host of other audio
manipulation equipment.
Studios centred in Co-
logne, Tokyo, Paris, as
well as the USA began
to be filled by these, and
the inventions eventually
began to filter through
to the bands of the time.
Whether it was using the
Theremin to add a new
dimension to their sound,
speeding up recordings
made on tape to play
with tonality (see George
Martin and Strawberry
fields forever), these
inventions allowed for
sonic experimentalism
that had not been seen
before. Without them,
Psychedelic and Pro-
gressive rock, as well
as Krautrock, would not
have been possible.
But the most impor-
tant invention of the
60s for the future of
electronic music was the
Moog modular, one of
the first in a long line of
synthesisers manufac-
tured by Robert Moog.
It defined the interface
that synthesisers still
carry to this day, and its
wealth of modular sound
building possibilities
indirectly spawned a
whole host of musical
genres. Moog’s name,
along with Don Buchla’s
(Moog’s brother in arms
in the field of modular
synthesisers), forms an
important part of the lore
of electronic music. Cre-
ation of completely novel
its message of equality
will always proliferate.
It was not just in the
melodic aspect that house
borrowed (or rather
extensively sampled)
from Disco. Disco was
the soundtrack to the
cocaine epidemic and
the lever which lifted
the ban on sexuality on
the dancefloor, and it
would pass on both the
use of intoxicants and the
emphasis on free expres-
sion through dance to its
Chicago fledgling. Along
with Jesse Saunders,
Knuckles utilised newly
commercially available
drum machines in order
to make disco bouncier
and even more suitable
for dancing. The hypnotic
beat programming of the
Roland TR-808 would
become the rhythmic
paradigm of the decade,
inspiring early Hip-Hop
MCs amongst others.
Jumping across lake
Michigan to the border
with Canada, techno was
being born around the
same time. It was inevi-
table that Detroit would
be the setting for another
musical explosion.
Having given birth to so
many great musicians
just two decades prior,
motor city was beginning
to lose its sparkle. The
motor industry was
slowing down, and the
hard-edged industrial
surroundings, with many
warehouses going empty,
was the perfect place
for hard-hitting tunes to
be introduced to large
crowds of moody youths.
Instead of taking cues
from American disco,
this grittier cousin of
House drew inspiration
from European and Jap-
anese synthpop, and the
darker reaches of funk
(ergo some of the funkier
early Detroit techno took
on the name Electro
Funk). It was three high-
school friend messing
around with these robotic
rhythms which came to
define the genre. Juan
Atkins, Derrick May
and Kevin Saunderson –
collectively known as the
Belleville Three - would
go on to make some of
the most important music
of the decade, found la-
bels, and inspire millions.
But first the music had to
cross the Atlantic.

A tale of two cities
Modern electronic
music has its roots deep
in two cities of America’s
rust belt: motor city De-
troit and windy city Chi-
cago. The mere mention
of these names brings
associations to a plethora
of sounds, and it was the
soundscapes of these two
cities that proved to be
the most fertile ground
for a musical revolution
in the 80s.
On Chicago’s side,
it all started with “The
Godfather of House”
– Frankie Knuckles.
Originally from Bronx,
Frankie moved to Chica-
go to spin disco, soul and
R&B at The Warehouse,
the club which gave
House music its name
(because Warehouse
music just doesn’t sound
as cool). This is also
where the beautiful story
of electronic music’s con-
nection with LGBTQ and
minority communities
begins - the warehouse
was a safe space for what
was initially a clientele
of black gay men. Even
though the genre came
to encompass many com-
munities, its roots will
never be forgotten, and
