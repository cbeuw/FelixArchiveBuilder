An entire article could
be written on this fateful
referendum alone. The
Leave campaign was
based on lies and anti-mi-
grant rhetoric, and the
Remain campaign was
based on fearmongering
and an overcrowding of
untrusted establishment
politicians. Remaining
in the EU, as backed
by Cameron’s govern-
ment, was rejected by an
infamously slim margin
of 52-48, as a rejection
of the establishment and
a demand for change.
Cameron, embarrassed,
was forced to step down
after 6 years as Prime
Minister, triggering a
Conservative leadership
contest which was ulti-
mately won by Theresa
May – a Remain-voter
promising to get Brex-
it done. Meanwhile, a
second Labour leadership
contest was triggered by
rebels in the Parliamen-
tary Labour Party (PLP),
a contest that was won by
an increased landslide by
Corbyn.
Parliament triggered
Article 50 on 29 March
2017, starting the two
year withdrawal process.
Realising that the
Cameron majority may
not be enough to get a
controversial Brexit deal
through Parliament, and
with Jeremy Corbyn’s La-
bour polling disastrously
compared to her party,
May called an early Gen-
eral Election, hoping to
crush the opposition and
gain a great majority.
Despite the pundits ex-
pecting Labour to receive
their worst ever election
results for almost a centu-
ry, Corbyn and his party
campaigned on a progres-
sive manifesto promising
the abolition of tuition
fees and putting public
ownership back onto the
agenda. May’s popular-
ity fell, along with the
Tories’ manifesto launch
offering next to nothing
for the ordinary working
family. Young voters were
inspired by Corbyn and
his policies to come out
in record numbers, and
when the Exit Poll came
out at 10pm on 8th June,
it shocked the nation.
Corbyn had won many
seats and forced a hung
Parliament, with the
electorate firmly reject-
ing May’s call. Forced
to enter into a confi-
dence-and-supply deal
with the Democratic Un-
ionist Party (DUP), the
Tories went into minority
government.
With a widely un-
popular Brexit deal
negotiated by 2019, it was
time to take the deal to
Parliament for approval.
Parliament, with Corbyn
as Leader of the Opposi-
tion, rejected it multiple
times in historic defeats
on a scale never before
seen for a governing
party, and delayed Brexit
to October 31st to avoid
a no deal exit. Unable
to deliver Brexit, May
stepped down in June
and triggered another
Conservative leadership
contest, this time won by
Boris Johnson, former
Mayor of London and
former Foreign Minister,
promising to get Brexit
done by October 31st no
matter the cost – even
with no deal in place.
With a new Brexit
deal negotiated by Prime
Minister Johnson, la-
belled as ‘May’s deal but
even worse’, he failed to
get it through Parliament
and Parliament forced
Johnson to delay Brexit
even further in order to
avoid no deal, with a new
leaving date of January
31st – meaning that John-
son failed to deliver his
flagship promise.
With the Labour Party
agitating for an early
General Election to save
our public services and
deal with Brexit once and
for all, and with no way
forward for his deal in
this Parliament, Johnson
decided to back an early
election: for December
12th, 2019 – this Thurs-
day.
With both Labour and
the Tories hopeful to win
a majority, with Nigel
Farage’s new Brexit Party
in the mix, and with the
Liberal Democrats mov-
ing to a ‘Cancel Brexit’
position, it is unclear how
this election will play out.
For many, tactical voting
for a Second Referendum
or Leave majority will
dictate how they vote.
For others, the National
Health Service and the
threat posed to it by US
trade deals is their main
concern. Can Jeremy Cor-
byn end 9.5 years of Tory
austerity with a Labour
majority government
transforming the UK and
giving voters the final say
on Brexit? Will Johnson
secure a Tory majority
and get his withdrawal
agreement through Par-
liament? Or will we enter
another hung parliament,
with the SNP or the Lib
Dems as the kingmakers?
All shall be revealed in
4 days time – and it all
depends on how we vote.
Make sure you go to the
polls this Thursday and
have your say in the most
important election since
1979.
