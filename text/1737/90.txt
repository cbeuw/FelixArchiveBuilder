t is estimated that
over 100,000 people
in the UK are living
with HIV. An esti-
mated 7,500 of those are
undiagnosed. The life
expectancy for people
diagnosed early (15-59)
is the same as the general
population. However
nearly half of HIV diag-
noses are late.
HIV is transmitted
through particular body
fluids.Thisincludesblood,
semen, vaginal and rectal
secretions, and breast
milk. The greatest form of
transmission of the virus
is through unprotected
sex with a transmission
risk of 2-20%. But babies
can contract HIV from the
mother during pregnancy,
childbirth and breastfeed-
ing at a rate of 15-45%.
Sharing of needles and
needlestick injuries can
transfer the virus as well
as blood transfusions and
organ transplants from
infected donors.
Blood donations are
tested rigorously for any
blood-borne viruses in the
UK.Despitethis,menwho
have sex with men, sex
workers and people who
have group sex are not
allowed to donate blood
within 3 months of having
sex. This policy does not
take into account sexual
behaviour, for example,
condom use, PrEP/PEP
use, monogamy or recent
STI tests.
HIV damages immune
cells making it difficult
to fight infections. When
a person with HIV has
extensive damage to
the immune system and
acquires a life-threatening
infection this is called
AIDS.
HIV and Imperial
Earlier this year the
second patient in the world
to achieve HIV remission
was at Hammersmith
Hospital. After develop-
ing Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
this patient underwent
chemotherapy and stem
cell therapy. Unfortunate-
ly, this type of treatment
is too toxic for standard
HIV therapy. However,
this is very promising for
developing treatments in
the future. Dr Ian Gabriel
said, “The treatment we
used at Imperial was
different than that of the
‘Berlin Patient’ since it
used no radiotherapy and
highlights that its effec-
tiveness lies in preventing
cells from being infected.
This exemplifies the need
to pursue and develop
new strategies based on
abolishing CCR5 expres-
sion.”
The Imperial College
Trust has been heavily
involved in HIV research
and treatment from identi-
fying the abnormalities in
an HIV infected immune
system to developing an
HIV vaccine. The devel-
opment of an HIV vaccine
has been ongoing for over
30 years. At Hammer-
smith Hospital the most
recent HIV vaccine trial,
Ad4HIV, has shown some
promising preliminary
results. The results of this
trial should be published
early next year.
The Imperial College
Trust has also led the way
for progressive and inclu-
sive STI testing with the
introduction of specialist
services for the trans com-
munity at 56 Dean Street.
They are a trans-led team
who offer medical, social
and housing support.  
What we did
We have given out
over 300 red ribbons
over the last week. We
have raised £184.19 so
far for Terrence Higgins
Trust. We had a stall in
Beit Quad on Wednesday
28th November giving out
ribbons and information
pamphlets about HIV and
PrEP. The ICSM Welfare
team organised a free and
confidential STI testing
event at the Reynolds that
evening. It was so popular
they’re considering
another event soon in the
future!
Important things to
know about HIV
Several measures can
reduce the risk of HIV
transmission during sex.
Type of sex has different
levels of risk of contract-
ing HIV from receptive
anal sex being the highest
risk to receptive oral sex
being the lowest risk.
Factors that can increase
the risk of transmission
involve inflammation of
mucosal membranes such
as STIs and the presence
of blood from menstrua-
tion or rough sex causing
abrasion. Factors that
decrease the risk of trans-
mission include the use of
PEP and PrEP, circumci-
sion and lubrication.
What is PrEP?
PrEP stands for
pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Taking it regularly every
day can prevent someone
from getting HIV (in an
HIV negative person). It
is the first HIV prevention
strategy that can be used
by both men and women
without depending on
their partner. Taking PrEP
every day has shown to
reduce someone’s risk
of contracting HIV by
over 90%. There are
also ongoing studies
looking into the inter-
actions between PrEP
and hormones. At the
moment it is unlikely
that PrEP interacts with
hormones. However, most
studies into PrEP have
investigated its effects in
men who have sex with
men and heterosexual

couples. So there is a
push for studies into the
effectiveness of PrEP in
the trans population and
during pregnancy that will
hopefully improve our
insight. It is important to
know that PrEP does not
protect against other STIs
so try to use other barrier
methods if you want full
protection.
What is PEP?
PEP stands for post-ex-
posure prophylaxis.
Similar to the morning
after pill PEP can be taken
within 72 hours after
exposure to HIV to stop
the infection. It’s meant to
be used as a last line resort
in case of an accident (eg
condom breaking) rather
than using it routinely
after sex or after sharing
needles. Once you start
PEP you have to take it
once or twice every day
for 28 days. The sooner
it is started and the closer
you stick to the regimen
the more effective it is at
preventing HIV. You’re
eligible for PEP if you
might have been exposed
to HIV during sex, have
shared needles or have
been sexually assaulted in
the last 72 hours.
PEP can be prescribed
to you at a sexual health
clinicorinA&E.However,
PrEP, in England, is a bit
more difficult to attain. It
is possible to buy PrEP
online but it comes to
between £17.50 to £80 per
month. The other option is
enrolling on the IMPACT
Trial, which gives PrEP to
the participants for free. It
is only open to high-risk
populations:
- Men who have sex
with men or trans women,
who have had sex without
condoms in the last 3
months, and feel they’re
likely to do so in the next
3 months
- HIV negative partner
of an HIV positive person
when the positive partner
does not have an unde-
tectable viral load, and it
is likely they’ll have sex
without condoms
- Other people who
are clinically assessed to
also be a high risk of HIV
infection
Get tested!
Most importantly,
make sure to get tested
regularly! When should
you get tested?
Every 3-6 months if
you’re having sex regu-
larly
Every time you have a
new sexual partner
If you notice any
changes to your genitals
eg itchiness, unusual dis-
charge, skin changes, pain
during sex/when peeing
etc.
If you have sex with
someone with an STI
If you have symptoms
make sure you visit your
local sexual health clinic
or your GP, but if you
don’t you can order a
home testing kit. Home
testing kits are free to
order in some postcodes.
If your borough doesn’t
fund home testing kits
you can buy an HIV home
testing kit for about £23
or a chlamydia and gon-
orrhoea screening for £26.
You can order kits from
SH:24 and Fettle, who
work alongside the NHS.
