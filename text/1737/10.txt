A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Education), Ashley Brookes, to catch up about NSS and PRES
recommendations, rep training feedback, and his trip to Singapore!
Felix: Last time, we
spoke about progress
with analysing and
bringing the results
of the NSS and the
PRES to the College
and the working
groups would be set
up for those. What’s
the progress?
AB: For the NSS, we had
a working group. It was
interesting because there
was a lot of agreement
amongst some of the
different departments on
the recommendations
we provided, and it was
something that they had
raised as their own issue
as well - so it was good
to see that was a synergy
between our recommen-
dations and some of the
action plans that they had
been thinking of.
Felix: What types of
things were shared?
AB: Things like exam
solutions being more
accessible and available
to students, and provid-
ing more funding for
student-staff community
initiatives were two.
Providing more precise
feedback and guidance
on assessment for major
projects, as well - some-
times they are so loosely
defined that students don’t
really know so what the
marking criteria is.
We have had one meeting,
and the next meeting is
scheduled for February -
so it’s a case of trying to
do do as much as possible
around the recommenda-
tions between now and
then. I and the reps have
created a spreadsheet of
all the recommendations
across the different de-
partments so that we can
actually track from the
student perspective what
is happening with the rec-
ommendations over the
term and over the year - I
think that’s very valuable.
I’ve also been liaising
with Rachel Witton,
Executive Officer in the
College Education Office,
about how to do that –
apply a bit more pressure
to get things done.
Felix: How is imple-
mentation of PRES
recommendations
going?
AB: The PRES working
group has been a bit
slower on organising the
first meeting. We have
been applying a bit of
pressure from myself
and the Graduate Student
Union to get the first
meeting up and running
before Christmas.
There has also been a
slightly different but
related working group
created, looking at post-
graduate regulations, and
we’ll be meeting at the end
of this week for the first
time. The undergraduate
curriculum went through
a complete review of
regulations before major
modifications, and now
there is a similar thing
occuring for postgraduate
study. Historically there
has been a bit of a dispar-
ity across departments, so
they’re trying to bring it
all together as one set of
documents of policy and
regulations.
Felix: So‘regulations’
refers to policy and
the official guidance
on how assessment
is carried out, and so
on?
AB: Yes - in particular,
for example, we will be
looking to ensure parity
in the experience of post-
graduates going through
the early stage assessment
and late stage review.
Felix: Last time, we
spoke about quality
assurance for post-
graduates, and how
regulations exist but
they aren’t always
followed or tracked.
Is that something
else you’d be wanting
to look into with the
Postgraduate Re-
search Quality Com-
mittee?
AB: That is essentially
the idea behind all of
this - there is no general
oversight. The fact that it
will be centralised - that
there will be one set of
regulations - will make
it a lot easier to make
sure that supervisors are
adhering to policy in a
more structured way.
Felix: Regarding the
recent rep training,
how did that go?
AB: I would say we
captured a good 80% of
people – there are always
some people not available
on the day. I think having
some targeted groups,
where we targeted 20
students at time, generally
worked quite well. The
training was generally
very well received - we did
a survey at the before and
after each session and we
got really good positive
feedback with reps feeling
more confident in their
ability to do tasks they
need to. The sessions
have been delivered by
myself Shervin, Abhijay,
and also by other people
in the rep team who have
helped when necessary
such as Lucy and Gabi
and Christy - so overall
I think it’s been a strong
team effort.
Felix: In our last interview,
you had some very strong
words about how there
has been some failure in
rolling out rep training
this year - with it being
very late for certain roles.
Based on the training that
you have just done and
some of the feedback you
had from that, as well as
thinking about how things
can be improved for
next year, what are your
findings and what are your
recommendations for how
rep training should be
improved next year?
AB: We definitely want to
bring the CU rep training
earlier in the year - finding
the right time is not
always easy but we feel
that should be done before
the summer, since all the
CU Presidents are already
enrolled by that point.
Training of the other
reps has generally been
good - it has been in time
before the departmental
Student-Staff Commit-
tees, which is one of the
critical times you want
people to be up to speed.
I don’t think it is possible
to really bring that any
earlier because it happens
as soon as possible after
Autumn elections.
Felix: You mentioned
in your recent Union
Council report a vid-
eo, that was made to
improve SOLE feed-
back - what does that
mean?
AB: I think SOLE has had
a bit of a bad press from
students and probably
from staff as well. It
doesn’t necessarily always
capture views or problems
in the right way, and there
is work being done in the
college to try and revamp
that and renew SOLE in
the future. However, in
the meantime, we need to
work with what we have.
So we are going to put out
a video to help students
fill in the survey, to help
give as much constructive
criticism as they can - to
give specific actionable
points to lecturers, for
example. That will be
released when SOLE goes
live.
Felix: You recently
went on a work trip
to Singapore. What
was that about?
AB: That was an interest-
ing process to be a part of.
There is a joint exchange
program between the
the medical school at
Imperial College and a
medical school at NTU
Singapore. Imperial
College was heavily
involved in creating the
curriculum and content
for that course. It reached
the point where they
needed to do a periodic
review, to assess whether
it was a partnership and
collaboration that was
working. So theyn brought
in several representatives
on the panel from both
Singapore and Imperial,
which included a student
representative from each
university – and I was the
Imperial one.
Felix: What did you
find?
AB: Their approach to
learning is very interest-
ing - it’s mainly based on
team-based learning. They
read some proprietary
material before coming
to the class, and it’s very
much not lecture-based.
They have teams of 6
to 8 people, and they
discuss questions and
have to answer as a group,
coming to some kind of
consensus. Their answers
are then discussed as a
class. They have a content
expert as opposed to a
lecturer, who will then
facilitate that and provide
some insights in areas of
ambiguity.
It’s been very well
received by students and
I think it’s really helped
to build that sense of
community - and helped
students to be slightly
less competitive all of the
time.
Felix: Do you think
that there is an prob-
lem of competitive-
ness among students
at Imperial, with how
they they approach
their learning?
AB: I think there can be.
But the culture around
that is slowly changing,
and with the new curric-
ulum that is being rolled
out now there is much
more active learning. It’s
currently approaching the
end of the first term of the
new curriculum, so I’m
looking to speak with a
number of reps - particu-
larly the first year reps - to
try and get a feel for how
things have been going.
