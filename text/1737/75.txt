year for venture capital
markets. It was the year
that the largest amount of
money on record was used
to invest in the highest
number of tech companies
ever. More companies
than ever before were able
increase in users leads to
a rise in online buyers,
which represents an op-
portunity for companies
to profit. Consequently,
the founding of new firms
active in the technology
sectors should not be
surprising.
Conclusion
The stock market is
notoriously difficult to
predict. Currently, it
appears that we are not
heading for another tech
bubble given the signifi-
cant growth of the web’s
user base. However, this
does not mean that inves-
tors should not remain
alert. The fundamental
practice of examining
profit margins, debts and
sales forecasts, among
other metrics, should not
be ignored even if the
company’s business plan
appears theoretically good
enough to lead to profita-
bility. If user growth stag-
nates, investors without
a diversified portfolio
will likely be once again
exposed to major losses.
As Alan Greenspan
warned the investing com-
munity, it should avoid
“irrational exuberance”.

These developments
paint a picture with
several parallels to the sit-
uation established before
the Dotcom crash.
However, a strong
counterargument can be
offered to justify why we
are not headed towards
a new bubble: Internet
usage is growing at a
staggering rate. As of
January of this year, over
4.3 billion people use the
Internet. To put that in
perspective, the number
of users was 147 million
in 1999, a year before the
stock market decline. It is
not hard to argue that an
