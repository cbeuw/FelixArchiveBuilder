ensuring that early career
scientist are aware of the
need for them to retain
their own digital footprint
for career and biographi-
cal purposes. If they don’t
keep material it will be
lost. It is important for
veracity and their future
lives and historically too.
That’s a message I’d like
to get across to people.
For records generally,
it’s important to make
decisions about what is
to be retained, and for
how long. There are many
issues to consider in this.
The Archives creates and
manages a Records Re-
tention Schedule which
lists college records and
their retention or disposal
time periods. This is
online.
Felix: You also handle
Freedom of Informa-
tion requests – that’s
very current, rather
than‘looking back’
as you say, and has a
vital remit in terms
of ensuring transpar-
ency. How does that
play into your role?
I think our FOI system
is very good. It is run
by Central Secretariat
which oversees College
governance, of which the
Archives is part. We are
well placed to find the
required information from
contacts across College.
We all value transparency
and accuracy of infor-
mation, which is of very
great importance.
Felix: Who do you
work with around
the College?
Wehaveadigitalpreserva-
tion system I have brought
in, called Archivematica,
which has been picked
up by quite a few other
systems in college – such
as the library, tied into
their SPIRAL system.
Archivematica is an
ultimate system – things
will be kept forever – and
putting it there instead
means SPIRAL doesn’t
get clogged. They don’t
want to keep every paper
on SPIRAL forever, but
they can transfer it after
to an iteration of Archive-
matica, or another similar
system.
Felix: Is there any
other work you do
with the library?
In a few ways – a personal
favourite is that every year
during Women’s Week,
I and several colleagues
around the College run
a women’s ‘Wikithon’,
which is editing and cor-
recting Wikipedia pages,
in the library computer
room. It’s a great thing
to do and a good skill to
have. The Wikimedians
and colleagues who join
us are great because they
give tuition to newcomers.
Felix: Who else
do you work with
around College?
We work across College
and so, at sometime or
another, that will be with
all academic and admin-
istrative departments. We
also manage the records,
not just archives, which
are slightly different. The
former is about current
records which need to
be kept for some period,
or for longevity, and so
we look at the records
lifecycle: from creation to
when it no longer needs
to be used currently but
forms evidence of College
business.
Felix: What are some
of your favourite mo-
ments – either odd
requests you’ve re-
ceived or a favourite
item in the archives
themselves?
One time we had a letter
delivered addressed to the
“College Alchemist” – if
I could turn things into
gold, I wouldn’t be here!
My favourite archival
stuff is based on the 19th
century RSM records! For
a very long time I’ve been
doing a PhD thesis on a
series of lectures called
“Lectures to Working
Men”, which was set up
by the RSM in the 1850s
– it was the first govern-
ment-funded higher edu-
cation institute, so it had
to ‘give something back’.
It did occasional lectures
which were open to the
public, but it then wanted
to do something specific
for artisan-class people
who were very skilled
in their jobs. They had
to get permission from
their foreman in order to
go just for the evening!
And they loved it; it ran
for 49 years. The lectures
were on everything that
was taught at College to
matriculated students, at
the same level – and they
also did a lot of extra ones
at British Association
meetings and such, which
travelled around the
country.
It’s social history as well
as scientific history, as
well as professionalisation
development of scientific
careers, which were very
different from now. The
series eventually stopped
because education
changed hugely, and there
were a lot of other organ-
isations like the Workers’
Educational Association
which came in. There
were more evening classes
and night schools, and
more vocational options.
It’s a shame it didn’t make
50 years. There was a real
zeitgeist for educational
self-help in those days.
Felix: Do you think
that’s missing now?
Well, there are lots of op-
portunities, lots of things
online – but there is a cost
to them, they maybe too
expensive for the people
who need them to do.
The Open University is
still going. More people
are encouraged to go to
university now, so there’s
a change in outlook.
Apprenticeships, which
the government are trying
to bring back in a modern
form, are really important,
because there are a lot
of people who actually
would benefit more from
doing something practical
and that’s where their
expertise lies, rather than
trying to shoehorn them-
selves into a university
course.
Felix: You mentioned
working on a PhD
thesis; are there
other projects you’ve
worked on?
I’ve also written a book
about women at Imperial!
Women at Imperial
College Past, Present and
Future.
I was asked to do this
by a couple of the senior
women in the College
some time ago – Dot Grif-
fiths OBE in the Business
School and Dame Julia
Higgins in Chemical
Engineering – and it
sort of just grew. They
asked me at a time when
it would only have been
a monograph, but with
the increasing number of
women it just took off.
My premise was that there
have always been women
here, even if sometimes
they might have been
ignored – though often,
to be fair, they weren’t.
Even in early days at the
Royal College of Chem-
istry,(1845) the German
chemist Hoffman brought
his wife and his sister
who were doing assaying
on metals and testing
their compositions. T.H.
Huxley took his wife
sea-dredging on their
honeymoon!
There’s a good saying
which is that “no scientist
works in a vacuum”, as
we said earlier! Their
lives and family lives are
really important. If I’m
collecting papers, I don’t
want published papers,
I want the manuscript
papers – I want to know
what they were doing.
Relatedly, I run the Centre
for Scientific Archives,
which is a charitable
cataloguing organisation,
which at the moment has
a project to digitise their
past catalogues – at the
moment they’re just flat
paper which is hopeless to
search, so we’re making
it cross-searchable and
adding things like block-
chain elements for veri-
fication of ideas and dis-
coveries. You can find out
a lot more about people
and their interactions and
ideas this way, find out
if two different people
had correspondence if it
wasn’t known before, for
example. And this is a
cultural blockchain, not fi-
nancial, so it’s not huge in
computing power. Again,
the role always requires
me to be looking forward
and learning new things.
