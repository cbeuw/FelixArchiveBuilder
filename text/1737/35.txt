Knives Out (2019)
I
t’s not often that a
film starts getting
almost unanimous
praise from critics, so
when this murder mystery
from Rian Johnson started
to garner attention from
almost every direction, it
left me wondering: what
makes this film so good?
It centres around
the family of Harlan
Thrombey, a wealthy
crime novelist, who is
found having slit his own
throat the morning after
his 85th birthday. Benoit
Blanc (Daniel Craig) is
hired anonymously to try
to uncover whether it was
truly a suicide, or whether
there was “foul play”
(which I can tell you,
there is).
Knives Out is definitely
a traditional ‘whodunit’
film, but also, it isn’t. It’s
traditional in the sense that
it follows a familiar struc-
ture, yet manages to avoid
all tropes of those lesser
that have come before it.
With a devilishly clever
and witty script, Johnson
has managed to sidestep
the sombre atmosphere,
all whilst maintaining this
high level of suspense.
Where other films may
have lingered with a
serious tone, Knives Out
propels itself forward
with moments of levity
that brighten each scene,
whilst the suspense keeps
you hooked; not to give
any spoilers, but this plot
would really make Agatha
Christie proud.
Where this film also
sets itself apart from
a plethora of others is
the social commentary
running throughout:
Harlan Thrombey’s death
will mean the inheritance
of his significant fortune
to his family members,
but who will be getting
what? Taking aim at the
upper-class elite with
themes of inherited
wealth, nepotism, and
strong right-wing views,
Johnson pokes fun at
the wealthy, littering the
script with sharp digs
and excellent plot details
highlighting many of the
obscene, eccentric charac-
teristics of the elite. This
is all presented in a very
self-aware fashion, simply
adding to the enjoyment
and wit of the script.
Coming onto the
cinematography, Johnson
clearly has an eye for what
he’s doing. With many
low angles, close ups, and
panning shots, Knives Out
definitely doesn’t miss
a beat when it comes to
how they affect the scene.
These are testament to
how effective it can be
for the writer to be the
director, with each scene
put together perfectly and
often adding details that
may have gone askew
otherwise.
As a final mention, the
whole film is tied together
perfectly by an excel-
lent (and star-studded)
ensemble cast. With Craig
at the helm, donning such
an expertly done southern
American accent that you
almost forget he’s from
Chester, we’re taken
into the world of Benoit
Blanc, yet forbidden to
see the inner workings of
his mind. However, the
most inspired actress of
this film is the perfectly
cast lead, Ana de Armas,
who’s performance as
the kind-hearted Marta
Cabreras couldn’t have
been more engaging and
truer to the character.
If you’re looking for
feel-good film that goes
beyond the shallow
depths of many that seek
to provide such levity,
Knives Out is the perfect
film to put you on the edge
of your seat, and then
knock you back into it
with a barrage of wit and
suspense to keep anyone
thoroughly entertained
until the very end.
The Third Man (1949): A Look at the Film Turning 70
L
ooking back at
this aged and dis-
tant film allows
you to visualise
the significant amount of
time that has passed since
Felix was established in
1949, and also gives some
relevant perspective in
the advances cinema has
made. Written by Graham
Greene, the film centres
around Holly Martins
(Joseph Cotton) following
his pursuit of the truth
in finding the nature of
Harry Lime’s (Orson
Welles) death.
For the first half of
this film we’re thrust into
the unknown, with our
perspective being entirely
that of Martins’. We’re
left to unpack the details
of the events preceding his
arrival in Vienna as we’re
trying to paint a picture of
what’s happened up to this
point with Martins being
drawn to Lime’s lover
Anna Schmidt (Alida
Valli).
About one hour in,
we’re treated to one of
the most iconic entrances
of any character in the
history of cinema: a shrill
of a cat, a flash of light in
the doorway, and Orson
Welles introduces himself
into this film as Lime,
grabbing our attention
immediately. Here we
see the full themes of the
film revealed to us, with
morals beginning to go
askew as we’re shown the
true nature of Harry Lime.
Welles’ performance in
this film is characteris-
tically brilliant, stealing
the show every time
we’re greeted with him on
screen; the scene on the
Riesanrad with the now
infamous speech show-
cases his casual ability
to draw the audience in,
both charismatically and
effortlessly.
With the soundtrack
written and performed
entirely on a zither by
Anton Karas, the almost
spellbinding twangs and
plucks wholly set the
mood for the film, as
it examines themes of
morals, deceit, and love.
The cinematography also
brilliantly reflects the plot
and nature of the film.
We’re often given ‘wonky’
camera angles, shifting
the axis ever-so-lightly as
we swap between charac-
ters in dialogue, leading to
a feeling of disorientation
and uncertainty that was
so present in Vienna
at the time. We’re also
given iconic shots in the
sewer chase scene, with
silhouettes painted in the
dimly lit passages, culmi-
nating in an exhilarating
ending between Lime and
Martins.
Given more space to
write this review I would
have liked to touch on the
dynamic between Martins
and Schmidt, examining
slight details in the
interactions between the
two that were brilliantly
written. But as it stands
all I’ll say is that the final
scene of this film couldn’t
have been better; a fitting
end to a brilliant film.
