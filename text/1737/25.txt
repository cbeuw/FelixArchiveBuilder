but unfortunately do
not stimulate too much
of a narrative. The first
common point is the
motive of the human
eye as the prism through
which we perceive the
(sur)real. On Dali’s side,
the example of this is an
obvious one - Un Chien
Andalou. The contrast
between the shocking
visuals in Dali’s short
film collaboration with
Buñuel and Magritte’s
depction of an eye on a
circular canvas could not
be starker. Dali’s version
of surrealism constantly
teeters on the borderline
of the violent (see also
vulgar and vexing),
while Magritte’s is more
toned down. Over time,
Dali’s work became less
freely associative, and
Magritte’s became more
daring.

Surrealist Superstars
Magritte and Dali are two of the biggest names of the Surrealist movement, which changed the art world with
its daring incorporation of the subconscious into artistic themes in the mid-20th century. You can now see the
combined highlights of their works
B
russels’s Place
Royale is a
mecca of art,
like a small,
art-oriented brother to
the museums surrounding
our beautiful campus.
The Royal Museums that
flank it comprise some
of the finest works of the
European canon, from
the Flemish masters to
the modern genius of
Magritte. The latter’s
personal museum quickly
became a favourite of
mine when I discovered
it last year, and it was
already back then that
a single painting by
Dali amongst the sea of
Magritte’s works piqued
my interest.
Saint Anthony, naked
and ragged, kneels on one
side of the canvas, con-
fronted with fantastically
vulgar beasts symbolising
the devil’s temptations.
A white horse heads this
procession, seemingly
kept at bay by nothing but
the cross that the naked
saint is brandishing above
his head. The proportions
are horrifying. The horse
seemstobeatoncerighton
top of poor old Tony, and
at the same time his hind
legs are far behind him,
spindly and grotesque.
But the gangly legs look
even more terrifying on
the elephants following
in his wake. These carry
beautiful naked women,
palaces, an obelisk, and
what appears to be a
minaret. It is certainly a
very striking image but
more than that, it sheds
light on some of the ob-
sessions that both artists
shared: the little window
framing a woman’s body,
the magnificent clouds,
the masterful and lifelike
rendering. Like many
of Dali’s most poignant
works, it is situated in the
desert under a mesmeris-
ing blue sky. This stark
blue was flashing in my
mind as I made my way
to see Dali x Magritte, the

own museum.
The wide avenues of
Brussels are perfect for
contemplation, especial-
ly with the sky above
looking like freshly mixed
concrete. With some time
to kill before my sched-
uled slot, I lazily made
my way down Avenue
Louise, thinking long and
hard about the music that
would befit the vibe of
the exhibition. In the end
I mixed myself a punch-
bowl of The Doors and
Pink Floyd. I was happy
with my choice.
As an introduction, the
curators treated the mu-
seumgoers with a digital
take on a painting that
held great significance
for Magritte’s foray
into surrealism, and the
relationship between the
two artists. Threatening
Weather was painted as
Magritte was visiting Dali
on the coast of the Medit-
eranean, along with some
of the other surrealist
bigshots. Mingling with
Dali’s then wife, Geor-
gette, as well as his future
wife, Gala, accompanied
by Paul Eluard, gave
Magritte inspiration to
re-evaluate the role of rep-
resentation in his works. A
tuba, a naked female torso,
and a chair float above
the coast of Cadaques in
cloud form in the original
work, and likewise in the
installation. They morph
into existence slowly from
ordinary clouds, giving
us a rather simplistic and
awkward but nevertheless
interesting insight into
how the artists first tapped
into the surrealist vein.
The exhibition then
proceeds through sections
outlining the differences
and similarities of both
artists’ approaches. These
are divided methodically
the objects smooth and
luscious but at the same
time shocking. The Span-
iard’s ability to entice
with the beauty of his
colour palette and brush-
strokes, while at the same
time horrifying us with
his imagery, makes him
unique. On the subject
of dreams, Magritte did
not believe in their por-
trayal as an entry into the
surreal, while Dali freely
tapped into his Freudian
inspirations (perhaps
due to his Oedipal ob-
sessions). They also both
had a penchant for using
writing in their art. Be it
Magritte’s ‘Ceci n’est pas
une pipe’, French for ‘This
is not a pipe’, or Dali’s
The Enigma of Desire/
My mother, My mother,
My mother, they both
used words to add a new
dimension. ‘In a painting,
words have the same
substance as images’,
Magritte claimed.
Perhaps the most im-
portant uniting aspect for
both artists is the incred-
ible fame that they both
reaped. Dali’s ridiculous
curvature of moustache
sitting above one of his
quotes and Magritte’s pipe
are both staples of gallery
shops around the world.
Whether one approves
of Dali’s extravagant
lifestyle and questiona-
ble politics, no one can
dispute the impact that
both artists’ popularity
had for others following
them. Both had unprece-
dented success across the
Atlantic, and the impact
that the movement they
spearheaded between the
wars had on art following
the Second World War
cannot be understated.
They were two of the first
truly global art superstars,
and that in itself is an
achievement.
