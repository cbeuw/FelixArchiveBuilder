Mathsoc President & RCSU
President
A
fter a few
weeks of some
pretty glum
articles from
Alex, he finally decided
to rope in some help, in
the form of me, Aishy,
to bring life back to the
RCSU column. So, please
cherish this morsel of
positivity amidst what
has been a sea of Union
despair.
After a 2.5 hour council
meeting, last minute room
bookings for the Science
Challenge, and a 4 week
wait for Fifi’s signature on
a contract (in addition to
100 other things we won’t
bore you with), you might
be wondering why we put
up with all of this Union
shit on top of our already
high workload.
Juggling degrees with
our roles is no easy task
(unless you study biology
like Alex). Sometimes
we forget why we’re at
Imperial and the degree
ends up taking a backseat.
This week we both fell
into the deadly trap that
results in coursework
getting neglected in
favour of Presidential
work, and believe us, it
only ends in regret.
But how did we get
into this position in the
first place? Well, we both
had very different routes
into our roles. Alex ran
for RCSU President on a
whim and was fortunate
to just beat RON (I mean
barely…). Meanwhile
Aishy had been planning
her route to MathSoc
Presidency since first year
and was somehow roped
into a couple of other
Union roles along the
way.
As an elected Union
volunteer, there can be
a great deal of pressure
and responsibility placed
upon you and your role
might end up consuming
the entirety of your life.
In fact, more than half of
Alex’s personality is now
being the RCSU president.
You wake up thinking
about all the claims that
need approving, and you
go to bed frustrated, envi-
sioning the million differ-
ent ways that eActivities
could be improved. But
despite this, and no matter
how much you hear any of
us complaining about the
way the Union works (or
doesn’t work), we really
do love our jobs!
Being on a committee,
or in any role throughout
the Union, has massive
rewards. Managing
events, like the RCSU
Autumn ball, ensuring
that students’ views are
represented at council,
such as at the recent Halls
Rent Debate, and slowly
instigating some oper-
ational changes within
the Union is incredibly
satisfying. Knowing
that your actions have a
direct, positive impact on
100s to 1000s of students
is enough of a return to
make our roles feel more
than worthwhile. With
every event we plan and
every cause we represent
contributes to building a
stronger student commu-
nity.
What’s more, volunteer
roles can be a hell of a
lot of fun and encourages
involvement in something
bigger than just yourself.
What could be more
glorious than stealing
spanner from the CGCU
office right under their
noses at 11pm! The level
of inter-constituent Union
rivalry and support,
particularly with CGCU,
has made being a part of
the RCSU so much fun
this year. It sounds so
cliché, but honestly the
number of friends you
make through volunteer-
ing for the Union and the
numerous, entertaining
group chats that form
from these friendships is
what keeps us going at the
hardest and most stressful
of times.
Last week, we were
invited to attend the
PhySoc Christmas dinner.
It was lovely to celebrate
the end of a jam-packed
term with loads of RCSU
volunteers, past and
present. The large number
of students who take up
volunteer roles year after
year, both within and
outside of the RCSU,
is a testament to how
much we all genuinely
enjoy serving our fellow
students. I can say for
certain that neither of will
ever regret holding these
roles, they have shaped
our university experienc-
es for the better. I mean,
what would uni even be
without all of this Union
drama? We honestly can’t
imagine it.
Thank you all for reading
this atypical column. This
is probably the sappiest
we’re going to get in this
column, so don’t get used
to it.
On behalf of the whole
RCSU committee, we
would like to wish you a
happy holidays/revision
period. We look forward to
returning to the anti-union
content this January!
Sincerely,
Aishy and Alex
