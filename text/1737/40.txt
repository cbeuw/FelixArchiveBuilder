Binge of the Week: The Crown (Season 3)
U
pon the initial
release of the
first season
back in 2016,
it was made very clear
that the audience should
not get too attached to the
cast, as they would only be
playing the Royal Family
for the first two seasons.
However, Claire Foy, Matt
Smith and Vanessa Kirby,
who played Queen Eliza-
beth II, Prince Phillip and
Princess Margaret respec-
tively, were so incredible
in their roles that a large
chunk of the audience,
including me, dreaded to
return to the show with a
completely different cast.
Three years down
the line, Olivia Colman,
Tobias Menzies and
Helena Bonham Carter
have taken over the lead
roles respectively, and
they are absolutely won-
derful.
Colman, who was
announced to take over
the role some months
before her unexpected yet
well-deserved Oscar win
for playing another queen
in The Favourite, com-
pletely nails her role. It’s
honestly weird how she
finds a way to sound both
exactly like the Queen and
like Claire Foy at the same
time. Most importantly,
her facial expressions
are priceless. Each curl
of her lip, each lift of an
eyebrow conveys feelings
and messages very
clearly. It’s honestly quite
magnificent. Her take on
the Queen is slightly more
unlikeable compared to
Foy’s, though, given the
source material, seems
justified to me.
Bonham Carter, who
has always been one of
my favourite actresses is
nothing short of magnif-
icent. Usually known for
her more ‘out-there’ roles
(Bellatrix Lestrange in
Harry Potter, Ms. Lovett
in Sweeney Todd), this
role is quite a departure
for her. She is absolutely
magnetic in her role,
portraying the eccentric
princess with surprising
amount of elegance. A
very prominent part of her
arc this season is her bit-
terness - towards always
being in the queen’s
shadow, to her lack of
purpose in life. Unfortu-
nately, though, halfway
into the season, Bonham
Carter sort of disappears,
not really having much to
do until the final episode
of the season, which is my
only grievance with this
season. I just wanted more
of her, goddammit.
It’s no surprise to
anyone that Colman and
Bonham Carter excelled
in their roles. However,
the real surprise of the
season is how magnificent
Josh O’Connor and Erin
Doherty are as Prince
Charles and Princess
Anne respectively. They
capture the young royals
with so much emotion
and poise that it was hard
to take one’s eyes off
of them every time they
were on the screen. These
young actors may only be
a part of The Crown for
two seasons, but given
the amount of sheer skill
they demonstrated with
this season, I don’t think
we’ll have to wait long to
see them in more projects
down the line.
One other thing that
The Crown always excels
in is its cinematography,
which is once again off
the charts. Each episode
looks and feels like a
movie, and an expensive
one at that. Each shot is so
gorgeous that I wish I was
a royal. Then two minutes
later, the show makes
me realise how shit their
lives must be despite the
wealth, the fame and the
palaces.
Overall, compared
to the previous seasons,
season 3 of The Crown has
a slower pace. However, it
is as strong as ever, and I
genuinely can’t wait for
the next season which
will undoubtedly contain
juicier content, including
and not limited to the
introduction of Princess
Diana and Margaret
Thatcherintotheequation.
Although the cast change
took a second to get used
to, each member of the
new cast has managed
to perfectly embody the
real-life individuals that
they so successfully bring
to our screens.

Season 3
Quick side note: over
the last few weeks, there
has been speculation that
Imelda Staunton (Dolores
Umbridge in Harry
Potter) was tapped to
replace Colman and play
the queen in her 60s. This
rumour has been denied by
Netflix, but I am holding
out hope that this comes
to fruition. Staunton is
perhaps one of the most
underrated actresses of her
generation, mainly known
for her role in the Harry
Potter movies, which she
executed so perfectly that
half the world hates her
guts. However, given her
stage credits in the West
End, and my own expe-
riences seeing her live
on stage, she would be a
perfect fit.
