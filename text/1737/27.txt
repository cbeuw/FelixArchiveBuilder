The greatest play in the
history of the world
The Arrival: Two Brothers
Reunited
A
man wakes in
the middle of
the night to
discover that
the world has stopped. It
was exactly 04:40. The
title, intriguing and vague,
leaves you wondering
what the greatest play in
the history of the world
could possibly be.
The Greatest Play
in the History of the
World written by Ian
Kershaw and directed by
Rax Shaw is performed
by a single actor, Julie
Hesmondhalgh, through
monologue alone. I was
quite impressed how
one actor managed to
deliver a full seventy
minutes of a play single
handedly. When I arrived
at Trafalgar studios, I
was surprised to find an
intimate theatre consisting
of very few rows. It was a
true story-telling expe-
rience with the audience
huddled around, listening
to what happens next.
This made for a deeply
personal experience since
you could lock eyes with
Hesmondhalgh herself.
Furthermore, she inter-
acted with the audience
directly which lets you get
very absorbed in the play.
The creativity in the
props used was clever, she
told various stories using
shoes and their boxes
alone. Hesmondhalgh
borrows the audience’s
shoes to aid her sto-
ry-telling which is quite
unique. The background
wallpaper consisted of
glittering sparkles and so
you felt like you were in
a different world entirely.
Hesmondhalgh was also
impressively funny. It is
usually very difficult to
make me laugh however
Hesmondhalgh’s connec-
tion with the audience
made it easy.
My main criticism of
the show is that the plot
can be quite confusing
and the language used can
be difficult to follow. Ker-
shaw’s play alludes to the
voyager through the play
and parallels Carl Sagan’s
universal messages on
the voyager to love. The
allusion to the voyager
was clear however the
plot itself surrounding this
frozen time around the
main characters was hard
to follow. Potentially I
may not have the appreci-
ation for it since it seemed
more aimed at others
in the world of acting.
However, the creativity
in the set overpowers the
confusion and I left with
my heart warmed by the
delivery. Hesmondhalgh’s
glow also carries you
pleasantly throughout the
play. Although it may
not have been the greatest
play in the history of the
world, I understand the
reason for its name and
appreciated the talent
showcased in the play. S
amad (Irfan
Shamji) and Tom
(Scott Karim)
have lived very
different lives. Different
upbringings, different
parents, different friends,
different schools. Social,
geographic and cultural
barriers have divided
them for over thirty years.
But they have one thing in
common, they are broth-
ers, despite only meeting
for the first time as adults.
At first they think they
aren’t so different but as
they grow closer and try
to integrate into each oth-
er’s lives, they both soon
realise things aren’t going
to be as simple as they had
hoped.
Tom was adopted at
birth, whilst Samad was
raised by their biological
parents. Tom tracked
down his brother in the
hopes of establishing
the bond that he felt was
missing his whole life.
The pair are undoubtedly
different - Tom is brash,
enthusiastic and eager to
feel a sense of belonging
in the family he thought
he didn’t have. But he is
also alien and unfamiliar
to Samad’s bookish,
softer and more pampered
middle class lifestyle -
withhisCambridgedegree
and close-knit family unit.
Samad, initially equally
enthusiastic, starts to
regress as their lives
become more intertwined.
He seems threatened by
this new presence. What
works at the start slowly
starts to break down over
the course of this pacy
70-minute play, and the
cracks start to show as
family secrets are uncov-
ered.
Some things confused
me - the backstory of why
Tom was adopted was
hinted at but never quite
explained. However, the
marvel of the play in itself
along with the chemistry
between Shamji and
Karim made up for such
discrepancies. Although
I wanted more informa-
tion, perhaps the cryptic
writing by Sheibani was
intentional - it made the
audience really focus
on the current actions
and the beautifully raw
performances of Shamji
and Karim, who expertly
revealed their vulnerabil-
ity and pain.
What really stood out to
me were the non-verbal,
choreographed sections of
the play. Special mention
must go to the movement
director, Aline David.
Changes between scenes
were filled with meaning
as the brothers imitate,
chase one another, dance,
change clothes, battle.
Samal Blak’s designed
a very apt setting - a
circular revolving stage
that facilitates these scene
changes. David often
pits the brothers against
each other, either facing
inwards to each other or
mimicking one another.
I loved these moments;
it gave a fluid feel to the
whole performance, and
often the actions spoke
louder than the words.
This taut family drama
provides a superb exposi-
tion of loyalty, discovery,
loss, belonging, and
betrayal. The price is
reasonable for what you
get, and the tickets are
cheaper if you’re under
26. Delicate and complex
in both the writing and
performing, I commend
all those involved and
highly recommend this
play.
