S
tudent life is hard
enough as it is,
but travelling on
a tight budget is
a whole other struggle.
Finding the perfect get-
away only for your bank
balance to shatter all your
dreams is top two most
heart-breaking feelings,
and hint – it’s not number
two. That’s why for our
70th anniversary (OMG,
RIGHT), we’ve decided
to round up our favourite
places to go for under
£70, so prep yourself and
start booking your next
fun (and affordable!)
adventure!
Bulgaria
Return flights to
Bulgaria’s capital Sofia
are currently about
£30 in January (£25 in
February and March!)
and we couldn’t possibly
be more excited about
this! Considered one of
Eastern Europe’s main
hubs for both art and
history, Bulgaria has so
much to offer and if you
choose to stay in Sofia, or
what is called the city that
“grows but doesn’t age”,
get ready for some vibrant
nightlife, and endless
entertainment.
Food is relatively cheap
in Bulgaria, with street
vendors selling pizza,
Mekitsas (deep fried
kneaded dough, usually
stuffed with feta cheese)
and local banitchka
(pastry). Accommodation
can be a little expensive
if staying in central Sofia,
but moving a little further
out will save you loads,
with decent Airbnb’s
starting at about £15/
night. Anything stopping
you from going right
now?
Italy
Fly to some of Italy’s
most famous cities and
towns for less than £20
return! If you fancy a slice
of history, then Pisa is the
place for you. Located in
Southern Tuscany, this
beautiful city is not only
home to one of the world’s
most famous buildings,
the Leaning Tower,
but also holds some of
the most breath-taking
churches and palaces in
Europe.
If you want a holiday
with some hustle-and-bus-
tle and days full of
exploration, then Milan
is the place to go. With
many fashion designers
basing their brands in
Italy’s fashion capital, it’s
no secret that the streets
are full of fashionistas
window-shopping, so
get ready to step into a
real-life magazine as you
take the streets of Milan.
Accommodation in
both Pisa and Milan can
be quite expensive, but
when booked in advance,
Airbnb’s and hostels
tend to offer competitive
prices, with a two-night
stay costing about £45 on
average, meaning you can
easily book a trip to one of
these cities for under £70.
Denmark
Now we’re sure you’ve
come across the famous
sights of Copenhagen,
especially the canals
and views along the
waterways of Nyhavn, so
what’s stopping you from
booking your next holiday
to Denmark? Flights
in January are about
£28 return, and you’ve
guessed it – booking ac-
commodation in advance
will save you about £35,
making your stay there
cost about £20 per night,
even if you end up going
for a nice hotel. Copen-
hagen is also famous for
its Little Mermaid statue,
which attracts thousands
of tourists every year.
Make sure you pack
your stretchy pants if you
decide to visit Denmark
because the food there
is to-die-for. If you like
Danish pastries here,
wait till you try the au-
thentic ones in their local
bakeries – never ever has
a combination of butter
and flour tasted so good.
Nordic countries like
Denmark are also famous
for their rye bread, and
whether you try it as a loaf
or in a Danish open-face
sandwich, you’re bound
to love this popular food.
So, get ready for one of the
most relaxing vacations
of your life, and book that
flight to Copenhagen…
Luxembourg
Don’t be fooled by
Luxembourg’s microstate
status – this beautiful
country has so much on
offer, and you don’t want
to miss out on this one.
As one of the European
Union’s capitals, Luxem-
bourg’s capital Luxem-
bourg City is one of the
most beautifully multi-
cultural cities in Europe.
With return flights about
£35 between January and
March, experiencing this
charming part of Northern
Europe doesn’t have to
break the bank. While
there, you might want to
pay Château de Clervaux
a visit. This castle in the
north of Luxembourg is
home to “The Family of
Man” exhibition, curated
by Edward Steichen,
which toured the world for
8 years and attracted over
9 million visitors before
being archived in Luxem-
bourg. If you’re looking
to save some money, go
