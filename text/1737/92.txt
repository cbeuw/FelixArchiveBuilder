“René’s death
was a shock to
everyone as
his confidence
and charisma
belied the
mental health
issues he was
suffering from”
M
ental health
in sport is
very often
overlooked.
Athletes are often
perceived to be thick-
skinned, resilient, and
independent; looks can be
deceiving. The thoughts,
feelings, and emotions
that navigate in that space
between their ears are no
different from that of any
other person.
We are equally vulner-
able.
Fitting in multiple
training sessions a week,
some of which may be
early mornings, combined
with a degree puts student
athletes in a susceptible
position and makes it
critical that education of
mental health and self-
care is prioritised. We
are proud that Imperial
College Boat Club has
greatly increased the
awareness of and helped
break down the stigma
surrounding mental
health. Our former Club
Captain, Jack Walsh is
a founding member of
a student-led campaign,
Rowing Together for
Healthy Minds (RTHM).
RTHM was started in
memory of rower René
Zamudio, 22, who took
his own life in January
2017. He learned to row
at Bristol University
before continuing to row
at Imperial College Boat
Club. René started to
suffer from depression
during his second year at
university which had a
devastating impact on his
relationships, friendships,
sport, and studies. He
never showed any signs
of mental health issues
before going to university.
He was a private individ-
ual and did not share his
pain and suffering with
his friends; most were
unaware of René’s suffer-
ing and were devastated
by his tragic death.
René’s death was a
shock to everyone as his
confidence and charisma
belied the mental health
issuesthathewassuffering
from. As for many similar
cases, he was the last
person you would think to
be suffering from mental

health issues. RTHM aims
to get the rowing commu-
nity talking about mental
health to address prevent-
able tragedies that occur
all too often at universities
across the country. RTHM
also wants to break down
stigmas surrounding
mental health illnesses to
make it easier for those
suffering in silence to

support of mental health
charity Mind, RTHM
aspires to raise the profile
of mental health in rowing
and to inform athletes
and coaches about the
symptoms of depression
and other mental health
illnesses, in order to make
it easier for someone like
René to reach out for help
in future.
The RTHM campaign has been active around the
country. The campaign has to date:
- Partnered with over 135 boat clubs across the UK
- Sold over 3500 universal charity tops that clubs and
universities have raced in throughout the last year
- Supplied resources to all affiliated clubs that outline
the club’s commitment to prioritising the mental health
of its athletes.
- Raised over £4000 for partner charity, Mind. They
offer information about mental health and provide
support to anyone affected by these issues.
- Informed and educated on mental health via their
social media accounts @rthm_uk on Instagram,
Facebook, and Twitter.
