mental health, and how sport can be used for self-care (and destruction).

we’ve asked
sports clubs for
content on mental health
in sport. I am happy
to see that Imperial
athletes, alongside their
sport AND studies, run
a range of campaigns
spreading mental health
awareness. Additionally,
some teams have taken
steps to promote welfare
by having designated
welfare positions within
their clubs. This focus on
mental health in sport can
be somewhat attributed
to a societal shift in atti-
tude. The typical British
attitude of a ‘stiff upper
lip’ is being replaced by
an openness as a sign of
strength.
It takes a lot more
strength to process and be
I began scouts and tried
mountain biking, hiking
etc. I was also part of a
hockey club. I was better
at these activities, but
I never became serious
with any of them. Unfor-
tunately, it was around
this time that my family
life became chaotic and
stressful. One of my
siblings had been getting
into trouble at school and
this steadily worsened. It
culminated in them being
imprisoned. Additionally,
another sibling’s mental
health deteriorated
leading to them being hos-
pitalised. These stresses
contributed to me neglect-
ing sport and choosing
less wholesome activities.
I did start heading to the
gym recreationally and
through that I met a mate
who convinced me to start
American football. Up to
that point I had only tried
some mixed martial arts
and rugby, but from that I
really enjoyed contact.
In Britain, rugby is
often held at a higher
esteem than American
football. I feel this is
unjust. They are both very
different and I’d describe
rugby as a contact sport
and American football
as an impact sport. This
distinction is important
as it gives insight as
to why I came to like
it so much. Arguably,
the tackles in American
football are more aggres-
sive; gang-tackling and
tackling in mid-air are
common. Each “play” is
typically seconds, whilst
rugby “phases” tend to be
longer. My stamina wasn’t
the best, but I was quick
on my feet and happily
volunteered as a human
battering ram; for those
reasons I fell in love with

American football. That
year we made it to the
national championships
in Doncaster and I was
awarded the defensive
most valuable player that
year.
I kept playingAmerican
football through my
A-levelequivalents(called
Advanced Highers). At
that time, weekends were
spent visiting psychiatric
wards or prison. Having
to reconcile my role as a
young carer and general
teenage angst was diffi-
cult. It led me to not being
able to open-up about my
role as a carer for several
years, if I’m honest I
still struggle opening up
now. American football
provided me with stabil-
ity, a second family, and
a place to escape chaos. I
credit sport as a contribut-
ing factor to achieving my
grades and securing my
place at Imperial.
Prior to starting at
Imperial, I undertook a
year-in-industry in Kent.
This was a big move for
a seventeen-year-old, but
it was an opportunity to
allow my family to heal
(without having to worry
about me) and to save for
Imperial. In hindsight, my
stoic ‘selfless’ act was not
wise, and I recognise lots
weekends where I didn’t
leave my room or speak
to anyone. Luckily there
was a one sweet release:
American football. I
found a local team a short
train ride away. With that
team we made it to the
national championships.
That year I developed a
toxic relationship with the
sport and began getting
frequent injuries. The toll
was two concussions, a
badly contused thigh and
sprained ankle. These
injuries didn’t stop me
playing. Not wanting to
let down my team, I put
my body on the line.
At Imperial I kept
playing American
football. My injuries
weren’t that serious,
nothing life changing, up
until the end of first year.
It was the old boys’ game
(of all games!) where I
managed to tear off half
my groin. After a few
months of re-learning to
walk and run I decided

season, but my body
wasn’t having it. I ended
up retiring during my
second year. I still sorely
miss American football;
it is the only sport I have
ever been remotely good
at. This highlights the
darker side of sport; sport
giveth and sport taketh -
make sure it doesn’t take
too much.
Sport has had a
profound impact on my
mental health. It provided
stability, fun, and dis-
cipline, but only when
boundaries were asserted
and I only gave what’s
within my capacity. There
are many resources avail-
able at Imperial if you
are struggling with your
mental health. Sport can
be one of these resources
and I would urge you
to give it a go if you’re
interested.
