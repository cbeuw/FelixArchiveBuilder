“I would be
shocked if
Cadence of
Hyrule didn’t
win the award,
what a great
soundtrack”
S
hitty weather, ex-
treme fatigue and
incessantly an-
noying Christmas
music. There are many
signs that the end of the
year is upon us, but one
that is much cheerier – and
a great topic of discussion
– is The Game Awards.
Effectively the Oscars of
video games, The Game
Awards celebrates the best
games of the year, with
many categories from
best strategy game, to best
music score and of course
the big daddy of them all:
Game of The Year. This
week we will take a look
at the nominees, I will
give my opinion on what
I think will win, as well as
what I would personally
like to see win the award.
Quick disclaimer!
When it come to the
Esports scene, I’m not as
involvedasIusedtobe–so
I won’t be covering those
categories. If you want to
see them for yourself, this
year’s nominees are avail-
able on The Game Awards
website.
VR/AR Game
“For the Best Game
Experience Playable in
Virtual or Augmented
Reality, Irrespective of
Platform.”
Nominees: Asgard’s
Wrath, Blood & Truth,
Beat Saber, No Man’s
Sky and Trover Saves the
Universe. As someone
who does not own VR
(yet), I can only speak
for which games I have
played at conventions.
Beat Saber is an absolute
blast to play especially if
you love rhythm games. It
is innovative and unique
– I would love to see it
win. I also think that Beat
Saber will take the award
this year as it is simply the
most well-known game as
well as, from what I gather
from friends, the most
loved game. Although
with the recent surge in
support for No Man’s Sky
I wouldn’t be shocked to
see it snag the victory.
Strategy Game
“Best game focused on
real-time or turn-based
strategy gameplay, irre-
spective or platform.”
Nominees: Age of
Wonders: Planetfall, Anno
1800, Fire Emblem: Three
Houses, Total War: Three
Kingdoms, Tropico 6 and
Wargroove.
I love strategy games.
This year has been great
for all types, from Anno
1800’s CIV-like gameplay
to Fire Emblem’s deep
story-based gameplay.
My personal favourite of
the year was Wargroove.
A spiritual successor to
the Advance Wars’ games
of yore, this indie game
has it all. Beautiful art,
engrossing gameplay and
plenty of replayability.
However, I believe that
Fire Emblem: Three
Houses will take the
award. It was a huge hit,
loved by all varieties of
gamers – even bringing in
people that aren’t typical
fans of strategy games.
That combined with the
massive 100+ hour sink
makes for the perfect
award winner.
Sports/Racing Game
“For the best traditional
and non-traditional sports
and racing game.”
The nominees are:
Crash Team Nitro-Fueled,
Dirt Rally 2.0, PES 2020,
F1 2019 and FIFA 20.
I’m not going to lie,
I do not like F1, FIFA,
or PES, so that’s off
the table. The choice is
between Crash and Dirt
Rally. Personally, I’m on
the Crash side because I
have always loved bat-
tle-racing games and this
is no different. Although,
I can see the side of Dirt
Rally lovers, it is realistic
but still maintains that
arcade-like charm (just
don’t smash into anything
or you’ll fuck yourself).
I think Crash will win
overall, mainly because it
holds that bit of nostalgia
(being a remake), that just
elevates it slightly above
Dirt Rally 2.0.
Score & Music
“For outstanding
music, inclusive of score,
original song and/ or
licensed soundtrack.”
Nominees: Cadence
of Hyrule, Death Strand-
ing, Devil May Cry 5,
Kingdom Hearts 3 and
Sayonara Wild Hearts.
Music is usually what
I remember the most
about games, whether it’s
the classic do-do-dos of
Cadence of Hyrule or the
fast-paced beats of Devil
May Cry, I still catch
myself humming it from
time to time. Without a
doubt my favourite score
was Cadence of Hyrule.
The Modern remixes of
the classic themes from
Zelda’s past are catchy,
uplifting and really hit
that nostalgia beat (pun
intended). Being a rhythm
game, I would be shocked
if Cadence of Hyrule
didn’t win the award, what
a fantastic soundtrack it
has, truly.
Role-playing Game
“For the best game
designed with rich player
character customisation
and progression, includ-
ing massively multiplayer
experiences.”
Nominees: Disco
Elysium, Final Fantasy
XIV, Kingdom Hearts 3,
Monster Hunter World:
Iceborne and The Outer
Worlds.
Role Playing Games
are really what gaming
was made for. You can
fully immerse yourself
in a world with fully
customisable characters
to create and deep lore to
explore. As an avid fan
of the Fallout series, The
Outer Worlds (developed
by the original creators
of Fallout), has to take
the cake for me. It really
allows you to play the
game any way you want
without punishing you for
prioritising smooth-talk-
ing over combat ability
