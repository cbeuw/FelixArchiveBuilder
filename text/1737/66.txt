Qualcomm XR2 - 5G
Ready AR Glasses
A
t a special
event in
Maui, Hawaii,
Q u a l c o m m
announced its new AR
platform - XR2 5G, which
succeeds the company’s
older XR1 platform that
still powers a number of
VR and AR experiences.
According to Qualcomm,
the XR2 is the world’s first
5G-supported extended
reality (XR) platform
and that this new device
would open up newer,
never-before-seen experi-
ences. The new platform
takes advantage of the
company’s advancements
in 5G and AI to reduce
latency and improve the
accuracy of environmen-
tal mapping. Further, the
headset supports up to 8K
360 degree videos at 60
frames per second. The
real highlight, however,
is the 5G aspect; with the
rest of the world slowly
adapting to this new,
emerging technology,
it’s great to see that this
device is already some-
what future-proof and can
already handle high-res-
olution video streaming.
The global rollout of 5G
in the next two years will
Google Assistant or Siri
for astronauts. Anyway,
one of CIMON’s purposes
is to help astronauts
actively cope with the
lack of social interaction
over extended periods of
time. This seems to be an
important aspect of the
robot’s job specification as
living in space, thousands
of kilometres away from
home, friends, and family,
can be pretty daunting.
Furthermore, CIMON
documents everyday life
in space; to put it simply,
CIMON does a lot of
vlogging. CIMON-2,
the next version, was
delivered to the ISS with
the hope to carry out more
tasks aimed at helping
astronauts tackle daily life
from both a practical and
emotional standpoint.
Reused Capsule
Launched Third Time
By SpaceX
As a part of the resupply
mission that delivered
CIMON-2 to the ISS,
SpaceX has, for the third
time, reused it’s Dragon
capsule. With this launch
marking the company’s
19th resupply mission,
it looks like SpaceX is
somwhat like an Uber
for NASA. In addition to
reusing the cargo modules,
SpaceX has successfully
recovered the first stage
rocket booster, which was
a part of this launch.
The New CEO Of Al-
phabet
Sundar Pichai, the
CEO of Google has been
appointed as the new CEO
of Alphabet following
the unexpected depart of
as board members and
shareholders. With this
new transition, coupled
with Pichai’s interesting
approach to products, we
may soon see Alphabet’s
experimental projects
come alive in the real
world.
Qualcomm’s Snap-
dragon 865 & 765
At the same special
event, Qualcomm
unveiled it’s new flagship
Snapdragon 865 as well as
the lower-end Snapdragon
765. Both processors
have a focus on 5G and
AI and are expected to
rollout along with 5G
enabled smartphones
early next year. According
to Qualcomm, the new
865 is “the world’s most
advanced 5G platform,
delivering unmatched
connectivity and perfor-
mance for the next gener-
ation of flagship devices.”
It certainly looks like
2020 is going to be a big
year for 5G.
Nikola Tre
In late 2017, Elon
Musk unveiled the Tesla
Semi, an all-electric,
futuristic-looking semi
truck. It’s the same event
where the updated Tesla
Roadster was unveiled.
According to Tesla, the
Semi is “the safest, most
comfortable truck ever.”
Over the years after the
Semi’s unveil, a number of
electric trucks have been
unveiled, but one stands
out - Nikola Tre. Nikola
is a company that special-
ises in vehicles, mainly
semi trucks, that operate
on hydrogen fuel cells.
The company announced
it’s third semi — Tre,
which is completely bat-
tery-powered and aimed
at European markets.
Tesla’s Semi is already in
production and Nikola’s
Tre is set for production
next year. In addition
to an all-electric battery
powered Tre, Nikola
is also set to produce a
hydrogen fuel cell variant
as well. With the Tesla’s
Roadster and a number of
other electric vehicles set
to release in the coming
years, 2020 looks to be a
big year for technology,
let alone electric vehicles.
