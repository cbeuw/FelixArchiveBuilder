T
he Union and
College are
currently in
n e g o t i a t i o n s
over the price of rent in
first-year accommoda-
tion, which College is
proposing to increase by
12.2% overall in order
to match a break-even
model as calculated by
Campus Services. On
Tuesday, December 3rd,
the Union President and
Deputy President (Wel-
fare) brought a paper to
Union Council for votes
to be taken on several
aspects of the rent
model. With regards to
the 12.2% rent hike, this
option was voted 36:1
in favour of rejecting it
completely.
This session of Union
Council saw around 30
non-Council members at-
tending, who were mostly
students keen to contribute
their opinion on the issue
that they felt would be im-
portant to them. The rent
segment of Council began
with the Union President
and Deputy President
(Welfare) detailing the
circumstances.
As explained by them
and as detailed in the last
issue of Felix, College
runs first-year student
accommodation on a
breakeven model, where
the total cost of running
the halls is offset by the
revenue made from rent.
This model includes only
first-year residences of the
accommodation portfolio
– Eastside, Southside,
Beit, Wilson, Pembridge,
and Woodward. Xenia
and Costume Store are
externally owned and not
considered a part of this
model. The running cost
is made up of expenses
including staff salary,
estates (security, cleaning,
waste management), a
fund for long-term main-
tenance of the hall, as
well as the debt accrued
from loans taken during
the actual construction of
the buildings. For older
buildings such as Beit
and Wilson, this debt has
likely been nearly paid
off; for newer buildings
such as Woodward, the
debt is aimed to be paid
back over a 50 year
period. This additionally
means that at the end of
the 50-year period, the
College retains an asset
that has value and that
has no debt on it - a value
which is not factored into
their "break-even" model,
and a value which is also
likely to appreciate or
increase over time as it
is London real estate.
Nonetheless, these are all
paid by the rent revenue
from students, regardless
of whether they live in the
hall in which debt is being
paid off for, or whether
they will ever experience
the benefits of the long-
term maintenance fund
they are paying into.
To the best of the
Union’s knowledge, new
costs that are not included
in the current break-even
model are being added
into the break-even model
for 2020/21. This includes
an 80% increase in the
contribution towards the
long-term maintenance
fund, and cost for staff
who work on halls off-
site. These are the main
reasons for the overall
12.2% rent increase, and
this is what the Council
has voted to reject.
Without these included
costs, there is a possibility
that rent would not have
to rise.
Each of these factors
received heavy criticism
from students at the Union
Council meeting. One
student who spoke at the
Union Council meeting
said: "The College's
funding model is an insult
to students who are meant
to be financing this. They
are not counting capital
gains from their property
holdings ... they are not
counting long term appre-
ciation ... It's a disgrace
that they do this and then
make us pay for it. The
12% increase in a year
is ridiculous, and I really
think we should question
what the Union is for if
they are not standing up
against this."
Independently of
overall rent hike, but still
a necessary part of the
discussion, is how in the
coming years the price of
rent should be distributed
across halls. Currently,
27% of the freshers' cohort
live in North Acton.
However, in 2020/21,
College will be discontin-
uing the use of Pembridge
(100 bed spaces) for
student accommodation,
and furthermore, the new
Kemp Porter building
(700 bedspaces) in North
Acton will be opening
for first-year residence.
Union Council Votes 36:1 to Reject Increase in Halls
During the Union Council meeting last Tuesday, the 12.2% rent increase proposed by College was discussed, the
“With regards
to the
breakeven
model
requiring
a12.2% rent
hike, it was
voted 36:1
in favour of
rejecting it
completely”
The Union Council and attending students at the rent discussion on Tuesday December 3rd
// ICU
“This means
that after
50 years of
students
paying off
the debt,
the College
is left with a
valuable asset
- which is not
considered
in their
breakeven
model”
