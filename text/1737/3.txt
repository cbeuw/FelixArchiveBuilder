T
he paper, writ-
ten by the Union
President, Dep-
uty President
(Finance and Services),
and Ethics and Envi-
ronment Officer, was
originally submitted on
the 22nd of November
and was passed with
minor amendments from
the President’s Board.
Itestablishesa‘working
group’ that is mandated
to investigate various
proposals for guiding the
policies by which the Col-
lege’s Endowment Board
invests funds – which
is due to report back to
College Council on Feb-
ruary 14th 2020, at which
time a vote will be taken
on whether to implement
the recommended policy.
One of the few conditions
on the recommendation
is that it must be “easy to
implement”, according to
Abhijay Sood, the Union
President, which he be-
lieves is reasonable.
Francesca Siracusa, the
Ethics and Environment
Officer, said: “we want to
have a discussion about
our beliefs and values
as a university, and how
that impacts everything
we do – including where
we spend our pounds and
pence. This is about what
we want to be doing just
as much as what we don’t
want to be doing. While
we are certainly aiming
for full divestment, I feel
there are other options
than just to divest or to not
divest – there are options
B, C, D, E, and F that
other institutions, such as
MIT, have done.”
Currently, the College
has millions invested in
fossil fuel companies,
totalling to £8.9 million
as of 2017, as well often
investing in other indus-
tries that have ethical
implications such as arms
or tobacco.
The working group is
comprised of members
of College Council,
including the Union Pres-
ident, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Provost, the
Dean of the Business
School, and an elected
staff representative. It
does not include the
Ethics and Environment
Officer, who was one of
the authors of the original
paper. The group will be
consulting with external
experts and stakeholders,
as well as accepting sub-
missions for consideration
from staff and students
prior to January 31st (see
end of article for more
information.)
Abhijay said of his
involvement that “it is one
of the most meaningful
working groups in which
I’m involved, because it
has a clear remit and is
going to report back on a
specific date.”
In the case of the paper,
the aim is not necessarily
divestment, but rather
to open discussion. As
Francesca said, “my
perspective is that there
weren’t many really con-
structive discussions that
were happening between
students and senior lead-
ership, and that was our
essentially aim of this
paper”. The complexities
of social responsibility
often pose difficult ques-
tions with regards to
‘drawing the line’.
This was recently
highlighted when an
internal email sent by Ann
Muggeridge, the Chair of
Petroleum Engineering
at Imperial, to the rest of
the academic section was
leaked, which described
divestment from fossil
fuels as a “simplistic re-
action to a very complex
problem” and encouraged
colleagues to consider
“how we can best ar-
ticulate the importance
of our research in both
mitigating the impact

A paper presented to College Council by the Union President on establishing a Socially Responsible Investment
Policy working group was passed on 22nd November
“We want to
discuss our
beliefs and
values as a
university,
and how that
impacts what
we do”
talking points and tactics
of the global fossil fuel
industry to undermine an
internal College process,
especially one which has
strong support from the
staff and student body.
That they must resort to
slyly persuading their col-
leagues that fossil fuels are
beneficial to society when
we know they are acceler-
ating climate breakdown
is just embarrassing and
demonstrates a blatant
lack of scientific integrity
… This leak should stand
as a sign for those who
support divestment that if
we don't fight for it now,
vested interests within the
College will block it.”
Speaking to Ann, she
said that her aim was to
“make sure that everyone
has their view represented
within the considerations
of the working group. It’s
freedom of speech here.”
She further clarified that
this is inclusive of people
within the section who
do agree that investment
in fossil fuels is socially
irresponsible. Her per-
sonal perspective is that
working with fossil fuel
companies is necessary for
development of sustain-
ability-focused practices
such as carbon capture and
geological storage, which
are essential for reducing
carbon dioxide emissions
while renewable energy
technologies are devel-
oped. She clarified that
she believes divestment
would be discourteous,
and could make it more
difficult to work with
fossil fuel companies to
deploy vital technology.
There has been growing
pressure for College
to address the issue of
ethical investment from
both external and internal
sources. In particular, the
campaign group Divest
Imperial has been highly
active, having staged
demonstrations – includ-
ing one with around 200
people on the Queen’s
Lawn on 29th November,
in partnership with the
UCU – gathered hundreds
of signatures for petitions
and open letters, and
met with senior College
management several
times. They, along with
Francesca, have also been
involved in organising a
recent Climate Assem-
bly, which played host
to guest speakers, ran
workshops, and opened
the floor to students and
staff to discuss and voice
concerns. Another is
scheduled for early next
year, with provision of
support from the Union.
It is also a topic on
which the Union has been
mandated to act for over
two years; however, little
traction has been gained.
Part of the reason for that
has been a degree of ret-
icence from the College;
however, Abhijay also
points to the Union itself:
“I don’t think my prede-
cessors thought that this
was a priority or thought
about it enough to think
of a way to constructively
move forward.”
“This is a testament to
what you can do when you
stand firm and don’t blink,
when you think about
how to get a discussion
going and open doors,
because there are people
who would not want this
to have been brought
forward.”
Submissions to the
SRI working group will
initially be written, but
a subset of early submis-
sions will be chosen for a
further oral presentation.

should stand
as a sign that if
we don't fight
for it, vested
interests in the
College will
block it”
of burning fossil fuels
whilst providing essential
raw materials and energy
to societies around the
world.”
Initially, this was iden-
tified as internal lobbying
to oppose ethical invest-
ment on behalf of factions
with vested interest within
the College, prompting the
Divest Imperial campaign
to offer the statement:
“We at Divest are
disappointed, but sadly
not surprised, that these
researchers immediately
felt it necessary to use the
