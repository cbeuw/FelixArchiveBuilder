T
he rights and
freedoms for
minority groups
around the world
are never handed on a
platter – they are hard
fought through libera-
tion movements. From
international women’s
suffrage in the late 19th
century, the American
Civil Rights movement
starting in the 1950s, the
ongoing global struggle
for LGBT+ rights and rea-
sonable adjustments for
people with disabilities.
The thing these all have
in common is they are
about the seeking of equal
status and freedom from
all forms of oppression.
Community is simply
defined as a group of
people living in one par-
ticular area or people who
are considered as a unit
because of their common
interests, social group,
or nationality. Anything
and everything can bind
together communities – it
could be the subject you
study, the sport you are
interested in, the country
you are from etc – and
feeling a sense of com-
munity and belonging is
crucial to having good
wellbeing. Liberation and
community are intrinsical-
ly linked; discrimination
and inequality makes it
harder for people in some
minority groups feel part
of a community, but also,
being part of a minority
group often gives people
another community to feel
part of.
At Imperial, liberation
has been, and remains to
be, as important as it is
in a global sense. Just 50
years ago, women weren’t
allowed into the Union
Bar and the discussions
to change this started a
massive fuss and resist-
ance from the male users.
(“Stay away from our
bars, drinkers warn ICU
women” reads the Felix
headline from 1969).
Issues persist to today;
we have an indisputable
diversity problem – the
proportion of female,
black and underprivileged
students here is unreflec-
tive of the talent pool we
recruit from.And cultures,
particularly in academic
circles, can often be
toxic – particularly for
minority groups. There
are a number of things the
College does to try and
improve this. The Athena
Swan and Race Equality
Charter are two schemes
ran by a UK universi-
ties-wide organisation to
improve the access and
outcomes of women and
ethnic minorities in higher
education. Imperial cur-
rently has a Silver award
from theAthena Swan and
is writing an application to
the Race Equality Charter
and these will give a good
incentive to reflect on
the issues these groups
face here, and begin to
fix them. Furthermore,
the College now has an
Access and Participation
Plan containing tough
targets around brining in
more students from under-
privileged backgrounds –
specifically, doubling the
number over 5 years.
On the student side, we
have a team of Liberation
and Community Officers
whose role is to represent
the needs of the various
groups they represent
and attempt to break
down barriers they face
at Imperial. Our Liber-
ation Officers represent
students identifying in the
long-standing groups lib-
eration groups – LGBT+,
Disabled, Female and
BME (Black & Minority
Ethnic) students. And
Community Officers
represent students with
particular community-re-
lated interests – Interfaith,
International, Ethics
and Environment and
Mental Health. They all
campaign to make change
happen, raise the voice of
the groups they represent
and facilitate the building
of communities. As senior
Union representatives,
they have influence both
in terms of what the Union
does, but also the College
as many have seats on
important committees.
Each Officer has a
network attached to them
that any student can join if
you align or ally with the
group. These networks
give you the opportunity
to engage and get involved
in what the Officers get up
to – be it campaigns or
events – and link up with
other students who align/
ally similarly. If you care
about Liberation issues,
sign up to the networks
and get involved!
