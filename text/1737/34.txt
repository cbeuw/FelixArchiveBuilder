an Imperial

the Spider-
verse does it
all”
N
ow that this
decade is
coming to a
close, for the
last paper of the year we
thought we’d do a round-
up of what we think are
the most important films
of the 2010’s, featuring
one from each film writer.
These films don’t neces-
sarily line up with the ones
we have loved the most,
however, they are what
we think have shaped,
changed and influenced
the film industry over the
past ten years. Film has
developed a lot over the
course of the decade, we
have witnessed the release
of the first Avengers
film, a Star Wars return,
Twilight happened, there
was a Frozen craze that
felt like it lasted forever
and much, much more...
MOONLIGHT (2016)
When thinking of the
best and most important
films of the decade, Moon-
light was one of the first
ones to cross my mind.
This film made history
when it became the first
best-picture winner from
an African-American
moment where the award
was snatched away from
La La Land (thank god)
to be correctly received
by the crew of Moonlight
after a colossal error is
unforgettable. A quick
Google search has told
me it was also the first
best-picture film to have
LGBT-themes at the heart
of the storyline – monu-
mental is certainly a word
apt to describe this film.
Before I was ever
interested in keeping up
with new film releases,
I decided to go watch
Moonlight at the cinema
on a whim with my friend
as he had been told it
was “good”, and I left
the cinema stunned. The
gorgeous cinematogra-
phy, impeccable casting
and acting, and beautiful
execution of the coming-
of-age story of a gay black
man were all achieved on
a low budget, making it
all the more impressive.
Although the systemic
racism of The Academy
and entire film industry
sadly still hasn’t been
eradicated, the recogni-
tion of this film was a step
in the right direction and I
am sure it will go down in
history.
of Into the Spider-Verse
manage to break the rules
of animation with inspired
creative choices and
by beautifully blending
multiple animation styles
together with phenomenal
results. This film could
make the shortlist of
most influential films of
the decade based on its
creativity in visual design
alone but brings so much
more. The way characters’
thoughts and feelings are
portrayed in this piece
is entirely unconvential
but undeniably real, an
audience can feel every
betrayal, every ounce of
pain while never being too
long from comedic relief.
Much like the average
Imperial Student, Into the
Spider-Verse does it all:
simplicity in terms of
means of expression.
It’s extraordinary how
immersive and hypnotic it
felt without digital special
effects – that’s due to
brilliant film and sound
editing. All cuts match
the music perfectly and
they feel so natural and
spontaneous, as if the film
itself was an improvised
jazz piece. The beat and
its pace are also essential
in building up the tension
on the screen.
Furthermore, Whiplash
is minimalist in the
number of characters
and subplots. The main
focus of the story is the
interaction between the
student and the teacher,
and it’s very clear from
the beginning until the
end. As such, the message
conveyed by the film is
very concise. Whiplash
poses two important
questions: how much
should you sacrifice for
a successful career? And
where is the line between
trying to push someone
to succeed and bullying
– does the end simply
justify the means?
Whiplash is one of a
kind, not many films are
as intense and memorable.
Great acting, a straight-
forward storyline with a
satisfying ending and the
omnipresent rhythm make
it one of the most impor-
tant films of the decade.
that has now become
almost defined by biopics,
with every studio wanting
their shot at an academy
award, and so churning
out (semi) non-fictional
pictures year after year.

THE SOCIAL NETWORK
(2010)
Cutting it close but
still making it into this
decade, The Social
Network established itself
in late 2010 as one of the
best films to come out of
cinema in recent years.
Taking source material
from an inherently lack-
lustre subject in Mark
Zuckerberg, a film about
the formation of website
doesn’t sound like the
most riveting or exciting
of topics, yet it is the exact
opposite.
Kicking off the decade,
this film showed audi-
ences exactly what a film
should be, with a perfect
script from Aaron Sorkin,
a perfect soundtrack from
Trent Reznor (of NIN),
and perfect directing from
David Fincher, it seems
it would’ve been harder
to make a bad film rather
than a good one with such
a talented line up. This set

SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE
SPIDER-VERSE (2018)
An animation so rich
and vibrant, I can only
hope the new decade
will bring us more of
its kind. Spider-man:
Into The Spider-Verse
perfectly encapsulates
the decade of the super-
hero movie by bringing
a twist to one of cinemas
most rebooted masked
mavericks. Bringing to
life a vision true to the
style of the comics that
inspired it, the creators
WHIPLASH (2010)
In a decade dominated
by sci-fi and superhero
franchises, Whiplash, a
film about a promising
young drummer whose
ambition is to become
a world-class musician,
stands out with its
cast only enhanced the
already outstanding script,
with Andrew Garfield and
Jesse Eisenberg being
the real stand out perfor-
mances. Again, I really
have to draw back to the
soundtrack here, as there
are very few films that are
so brilliantly scored. The
electronic whiring along
with strung out synthesiz-
ers perfcetly encapsulate
the landscape that the plot
is centred around, with
an extremely unique and
iconic sound. As each
brilliant piece of this
puzzle slotted together, it
defined itself as one of the
most important scenes of
the decade.
