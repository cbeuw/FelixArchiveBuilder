an Gogh, while
alive (1853-
1890), only
sold one paint-
ing. Though we all agree
that The Starry Night
(1889) and Sunflowers
(1888) are artworks,
people of the time detest-
ed or at least ignored these
canvases. Thus, was it not
art then and it is now?
Was it always art?
In contrast, other
masterpieces were ac-
claimed by public and
critic from the very first
moment. The Persistence
of Memory by Salvador
Dalí, a meaningful work
of Surrealism, was taken
to the MoMa shortly
after being painted. Pride
and Prejudice received
wonderful, favorable
reviews referring to Jane
Austen as “the profes-
sional woman writer”.
The Pieta was enthusi-
astically acclaimed from
the beginning, launching
Michelangelo’s dazzling
career.On the other hand,
Van Gogh’s case of
posthumous success is
not unique. Many other
painters, like Monet and
the impressionists, had
similar problems. The
Rite of Spring’s premiere
(Igor Stravisnski, 1913)
was a dramatic fiasco.
Mozart died in poverty,
without receiving his
present recognition. The
Girl with a Pearl Earring
by Vermeer was sold for
the current equivalent of
€24 .
These examples lead
us to the question that
entitles the article: Is it
art if everybody hates it?
According to The Oxford
Dictionary, ‘art’is ‘the ex-
pression or application of
human creative skill and
imagination producing
works to be appreciated
primarily for their beauty
or emotional power’. This
could make one wonder if
hating a piece means it has
an emotional power over
them, after all. Certainly,
a work can make you feel
uncomfortable or even
angry, like the very dis-
turbing Collective Inven-
tion by Rene Magritte or
Saturn Devouring His Son
by Francisco de Goya; but
for the sake of this article
we have referred to hating
a work as to loathing it for
its absence of worth.
The above definition
is not objective, for
the meaning of beauty
or emotional power is
different depending on
the person who judges.
Not everyone is moved
by the same pieces. Even
within the most cultured,
“Given that
art is very
subjective,
the fate of a
work depends
on the
collaboration
of spectators”
“Giving a
random
pineapple
art status
seems rather
ridiculous.”
renowned, and sensitive
celebrities there have
been different criteria.
The cubist movement
was extremely criticised
by figures such as Gino
Severini while others, like
Guillaume Apollinaire
and Marx Jacob, defended
it fiercely. However,
there are works that are
unanimously acclaimed as
masterpieces. Therefore,
it is tempting to say that
a piece is art if there is
enough consensus from
a majority of people who
feel that their “beauty”
or “emotional power”
is intense and profound.
Although, admittedly, this
idea is somewhat vague,
taking it as an alternative
definition of art, the
answer to the question “is
it art if everybody hates
it?” would be “no”, given
the lack of consensus
about its value.
Anyhow, this is not a
satisfactory conclusion
for it does not shed any
light on episodes like Van
Gogh’s. Given that art is
very subjective, the fate
of a work depends on the
collaboration of the spec-
tators. If they don’t have
enough tact and receptiv-
ity, a marvel could pass
unnoticed. Cultivating the
sensitivity of the observer
is key for the work to be
properly appreciated.
This is why time plays
an essential role in this
discussion. Continuing
with Van Gogh’s example,
19th century education
was much poorer than the
current one, thus people
were not exposed to
artisticformsasmuch.The
society was less prepared
to evaluate potential art.
This also explains why
the very innovative works
were often unsuccessful:
there was hardly anyone
with the right sensibility
to enjoy them.
Let us now explore
a complementary point
of view to the original
idea: would having a
single person like it be
a sufficient condition to
call it art? Accepting such
premise can create rather
interesting situations.
One of various examples
is the pineapple incident
that took place in an art
gallery in Aberdeen,
Scotland in 2017. The
one-pound-pineapple
which a student left as a
prank on an empty stand
became a masterpiece
when employees protect-
ed it with a glass display
case. Some claimed to un-
derstand the meaning of
this supposed work of art.
A theory jotted down by
the New York Times was
that “the pineapple sym-
bolized the U.K. leaving
the E.U., standing alone,
attempting to survive,
cut off from the outside
world”. As evidenced, this
tropical fruit seemed to
have been liked by some.
Ergo, by this logic, the
pineapple would be art.
Giving a random
pineapple art status seems
rather ridiculous. One
mistake of this reasoning
is that liking a piece does
not imply by itself that it
has emotional power, e.g.
a good sewage system.
Similarly, admiring a
work by its technical dif-
ficulty (without this being
the case of the pineapple)
is not synonym of feeling
its beauty. We can enjoy
how an extremely difficult
violin piece is played
by a virtuoso. However,
this does not endow the
piece or the performance
with artistic value, unless
we have been touched
by it. As can be inferred
by its definition, art is
not something that you
evaluate, but something
that you feel. Vanessa
Marianna from Daredevil
(TV) explains this idea
when, referring to a white
painting, she tells Wilson
Fisk that “it’s not about
the artist’s name or the
skill required (...) All that
matters is, how does it
make you feel?”
Let us conclude trying
to answer to the initial
question: Is it art if every-
body hates it? The answer
is “no” given the absolute
lack of consensus about
its value. But it would be
more cautious to answer
“not yet”, leaving a door
open to a future recog-
nition (which of course
may not always come). If
somebody is touched by a
work, which is however
hated by most, they can
legitimately feel that it is
a work of art, given the
subjectivity inherent in
the artistic appreciation,
and hope that time will
prove them right.
