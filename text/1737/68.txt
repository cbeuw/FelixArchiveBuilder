SCIENCE
1950s
After WWII, the scientific commu-
nity realised the full potential of its
possibility and power, and feels an
increased need to understand the
social context scientists operate in
and the ethical implications of their
science. Starting with an ‘Ends and
Means’ lecture series, and moving
on to one named ‘General Studies’,
students are able to learn, debate,
and discuss politics, philosophy and
ethics through the early 1950s.
1953
To meet the demands of society
in supplying science and tech-
nology expertise, Imperial was
required to double in size by
Government, from 1953-1963.
During this time, the college
sees substantial expansion
.
1953
Physicists Narinder Kapany
and Harold Hopkins manage
to transmit an image through
a bundle of fibres, demon-
strating that light can bend.
Together with a development
in optical cladding, this kick-
starts the field of fibre optics.
1956
Physicist Abdul Salam joins
Imperial, setting up a renowned
Theoretical Physics laboratory.
He goes on to be made the
youngest fellow of the Royal
Society at the age of 33 in
1959, and in 1979 becomes the
first muslim to be awarded the
Nobel Prize.
1957
Imperial celebrates its
50th birthday, estab-
lished in 1907 when
it received its Royal
Charter.
1957
The newly created Expedition
Board for overseas exploration
sends out its first trip to Kar-
akorum. A student falls down a
crevasse - eek! - but is securely
roped-up and hauled to safety.
1959
Helen Porter is appointed to
Chair of Plant Physiology,
becoming the first woman
professor at Imperial. It was a
while before she had company
though: it was 1969 before the
second female professor, Joan
Woodward, was appointed;
the third female professor was
Janet Vida Watson in 1974,
and in 1976 Anita Bailey was
fourth.
1960
The first all-female overseas expedi-
tion to St Kitts by zoological students
Shelagh Hocking and Anne Phillips
takesplace.DavidAttenboroughgives
them travel advice, although insuffi-
cient there apparently - local police
refuse to allow unaccompanied wom-
en to camp in the open wilderness!
1966
Alan Bishop, soil mechanic pioneer
alongside Alec Skempton, father of the
field, leads the scientific inquiry into the
failure of theAberfan Dam. The disaster
killed nearly 150 people, with over 100
of them children, as the dam overflow
swept through a primary school. This
leads to safety regulations within the
mining industry that still apply today.
1967
The alpha-chymotrypsin enzyme’s
protein structure is determined by
David Blow using X-ray crystal-
lography. It joins vitamin B12 and
haemoglobin as some of the first
understood protein structures, with
insulin following shortly after.
1968
The HESO-1 satellite travels outside the Earth’s
magnetosphere for the first time. The mission of
the European Space Research Organisation is
headed up by Imperial Physics Professor Har-
ry Elliott and his team, who contribute 23 in-
struments to the project to measure magnetic
fields, cosmic rays, and other energetic particles.
1971
Europe’s first million volt electron mi-
croscope, a huge machine covering three
floors in the department, is opened by
Brian Flowers, Rector of Imperial Col-
lege. It is used within the Metallurgy
department, which changed its name
to Material Sciences the same year.
1974
The Imperial engineering
degree is expanded to include
2 sandwich years in industry,
following conclusions from the
Government’s Daiton report
aiming to combat declining stu-
dents studying STEM subjects
at University, and the personal
guidance of Imperial’s Sir Da-
vid Huddie and Hugh Ford, who
foresaw an advantage for indus-
try-prepared students. In 1978
this became the 4 year course
with one industry experience
year we recognise today.
2013
The first test of the iKnife in patients
takes place. Invented by Imperial Col-
lege’s Dr Zolkan Takats, the knife is
heated by an electrical current and
cauterises as it cuts through tissue,
reducing blood loss. However, this
knife is simultaneously attached to
a mass spectrometer to analyse the
smoke, allowing the knife to tell the
difference between cancerous and
healthy tissue - in only 3 seconds!
