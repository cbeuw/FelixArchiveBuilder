ers, knew about the crazy
antics of this rude goose.
Being House House’s first
game, they are deserving
of the reward, it’s just
a shame that its likely
success takes away from
some absolute bangers
that were available this
year.
Games for Impact
“For a thought-provok-
ing game with a pro-social
meaning or message.”
Nominees: Concrete
Genie, GRIS, Kind
Words, Life is Strange
2 and Sea of Solitude.
Pffffff Concrete Genie is
AMAZING. The art is
beautiful, the gameplay
is insanely enjoyable
and most importantly the
message really spoke to
me. I urge anyone who
hasn’t heard of it to pick
it up and give it a go. I
love it and really hope it
wins this award, getting
more exposure. I think it
is likely to win, although
Sea of Solitude and Life is
Strange 2 as far as impact
goes are great contenders.
Covering important issues
in mental and physical
health, both these games
hit me hard in the feels
almost as much as
concrete genie did.
Game Direction
“Awarded for out-
standing creative vision
and innovation in game
direction and design.”
Nominees: Control,
Death Stranding, Resident
Evil 2, Sekiro: Shadows
Die Twice and Outer
Wilds. As much as I
want Resident Evil 2 (my
personal favourite remake
ever) to win this, I feel as
though Death Stranding
is more deserving. The
ability of Hideo Kojima to
put together all the parts
of Death stranding into a
cohesive cinematic gem
is undeniable, and with
Geoff Keighly (organiser
of The Game Awards)
being good friends with
Kojima, I would be sur-
prised if it didn’t win this
award.
Fighting Game
“For the best game
designed primarily around
head-to-head combat.”
Nominees: Dead or
Alive 6, Jump Force,
Mortal Kombat 11,
Samurai Shodown and
Super Smash Bros.
Ultimate. I literally
snorted when I saw Jump
Force nominated for best
fighting game this year.
It has been a mixed year
for fighting games, but
luckily MK 11 and Smash
are absolute gems. MK
11 keeps everything the
fans love about Mortal
Kombat, but the slower
than usual gameplay dis-
appointed some. Smash
“I urge anyone
who hasn’t
heard of
Concrete Genie
to pick it up
and give it a
go”
“Astral chain
was a sleeper
hit and
personally I
feel it does a
lot more than
many other
nominees”
Bros. on the other hand has
no haters. It has over 70
unique fighters, bringing
back every fighter and
almost every stage from
previous games. It has a
30 hour+ story mode and
it still gets DLC characters
despite 5 already being
released (this is amazing
for Nintendo). I would be
amazed if it didn’t win,
and being my favourite
franchise of all time, I
would be so happy to see
it getting the recognition it
deserves.
Family Game
“For the best game ap-
propriate for family play,
irrespective of genre or
platform.”
Nominees: Luigi’s
Mansion 3, Ring Fit
Adventure, Super Mario
Maker 2, Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate and
Yoshi’s Crafted World.
Not much needs to be said
here, Super Smash Bros.
Ultimate deserves this,
hands down. Although,
it is funny to notice that
every nominee is from
Nintendo.
Action/Adventure
“For the best action/ad-
venture game, combining
combat with traversal and
puzzle-solving.”
Nominees: Borderlands
3, Control, Death Strand-
ing, Resident Evil 2, The
Legend of Zelda: Link’s
Awakening and Sekiro:
Shadows Die Twice. As
far as action/adventure
games go, this year
has been great. Despite
lacking many traditional
feeling action/adventure
games, all the nominees
here brought something
unique to the table.
Borderlands 3 stands
out as being a blast from
start to finish, but I don’t
think it will win. Resident
Evil 2 and Zelda are both
remakes so despite being
amazing, I doubt they
have much chance either. I
would love to see Control
get some recognition
as it mainly flew under
the radar this year, but I
have a feeling that Death
Stranding will also take
this just because of how
popular it seems to be.
Action Game
“For the best game in
the action genre – focused
primarily on combat.”
Nominees: Apex
Legends, Astral Chain,
Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare, Devil May Cry
5, Gears 5 and Metro
Exodus. Man, oh man do
I want Astral Chain to
win this. From the makers
of Bayonetta, Astral
Chain is 100% action and
gameplay and I love it. It
was a sleeper hit and per-
sonally I feel like it does a
lot more than many of the
other nominees. I have a
sinking feeling that Apex
Legends will win though,
simply due to the massive
audience that it grew, as
well as its addictive high-
speed gameplay.
GAME OF THE YEAR
“Recognising a game
that delivers the absolute
best experience across
all creative and technical
fields.”
Nominees: Control,
Death Stranding, Resident
Evil 2, Sekiro: Shadow’s
Die Twice, Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate and The
Outer Worlds.
This is the kicker.
What a hard choice.
Super Smash Bros. is my
favourite series of games
but I cannot look pass
how much fun I had with
RE 2, Sekiro or The Outer
Worlds. Equally, the
general audience seemed
very drawn towards Death
Stranding and control this
year. It is very hard but I
feel like when considering
which game “delivers the
absolute best experience
across all creative and
technical fields”, Resident
Evil honestly takes the
cake. Despite being a
remake, the music, art, di-
rection and gameplay are
all sublime and I struggle
to flaw it in any way.
My personal pick would
be Smash Bros. But I
honestly believe this will
be the first time a remake
wins it all.
