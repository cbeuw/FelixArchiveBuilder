sparse, but also hard to
find out about.
The Celebrity Factor
Whenever I go to any
kind of performance
starring bigshot movie
stars, I find that a signif-
icantly large proportion
of the audience is there
for the celebrity, and not
necessarily the perfor-
mance. Sure, I could be a
snob and say how this is
destroying the theatre, but
I tend to think otherwise.

The illusion of accessible theatre: how far have we
In a world where we experience more and more things
through screens, the importance of theatre on personal
growth and development is crucial. But how can it
contribute to the lives of young people across the world
when most of us can’t afford tickets?

“Rush tickets
and lotteries
are great, but
only if you
know about
them, and care
enough to
queue either in
person or in a
virtual line”
E
ver since my
stint as a Felix
arts editor
began, I’ve been
preaching the importance
of making theatre more
accessible. For the most
part, the baby-boomer
leaning demographics at
the theatre astonish me.
I strongly believe this
medium of arts can be a
formative part of a young
person’s development. It
certainly was for me, and I
wouldn’t have it any other
way. The thrill of live
theatre can be inspiring. A
brilliant script brought to
life by a talented company
can be transformative.
In a time where we are
more divided than ever,
theatre can be where
we’re united. However,
with ticket prices upwards
of £200 (I’m looking at
you, Hamilton), how can
we expect an average
family to be able to afford
a night out at the theatre?
How can a young student,
barely able to make ends
meet, make the most of
living in London, one of
the theatre destinations of
the world?
Over the last few
years, there have been
some clear steps forward
when it comes to drawing
younger people to the
audience, but I’m not
yet fully convinced that
enough has been done.
Discount Schemes
A select handful of
venues have programmes
in place which allow
young people to obtain
tickets for very affordable
prices. Examples include
the Jamie Lloyd Company,
who have introduced a
£15 ticket scheme their
upcoming productions
including for Cyrano
de Bergerac, a brand
new adaptation of the
French-language classic,
starring James McAvoy.
The English National
Opera has a scheme called
Access All Arias, and
the National Theatre has
one called Entry Pass. In
addition to the Entry Pass,
National Theatre sells any
remaining tickets for any
performance, regardless
of the original price point,
for £15 to those with a
valid student ID card 45
minutes before the curtain
call.
This is all excellent,
however there is a huge
flaw in this system. These
schemes are extremely
poorly advertised. You
would only know of them
them if you’ve fallen into
the rabbit hole of cheap
West End theatre ticket
hunting. This restricts the
demographics hugely as
the only people who do
this are theatre nerds like
me. So, yeah, while some
theatres do offer some
deals for students, not
National Theatre, the
tickets were so in demand
that a ballot system was
put in place. Albeit, most
of her fans were on the
older side and it was
a shame that the play
was absolutely horrible.
Stunt-casting is a big issue
when it comes to the ‘ce-
lebrity factor’. Stunt-cast-
ing is casting people in a
show who wouldn’t be
cast otherwise either due
to a lack of skill or not
being fit for the character
in question. This is very
common, especially when
a production is suffering
from poor sales and need
a boost. Without naming
any names, this not only
makes for an unpleasant
theatre experience, but
also causes a spike in
the ticket prices, milking
the fans of a celebrity as
much as possible. It’s just
kind of sad.
Rush Tickets
This is by no means
catered specifically
towards students, but it
is one way of being able
to see shows in premium
seats for a minimal price
tag. TodayTix, a mobile
app, releases ‘Rush
Tickets’ at 10 am every
morning for a range of
shows for £15- £25, and
these are allocated on a
first come first serve basis.
Likewise, some theatres
still keep it old school, re-
leasing Rush Tickets at the
box office every morning.
Popular shows such as
Hamilton and Harry
Potter and the Cursed
Child have been doing
online weekly lotteries
(Cursed Child’s is through
TodayTix, whereas
Hamilton has its own
lottery app). Rush Tickets
and lotteries are great, but
only if you know about
them, and care enough to
queue either in person or
in a virtual line. There-
fore, similar to discount
schemes, they mainly
tend to be used by those
who are already involved

stint in Waitress on
Broadway, there were
several incidences of

disgusting), however, it’s
only logical that with star
power comes attendance
by those who would never
pay up for a theatre ticket
otherwise, including
young people.
This sometimes works
well. For example,
whenever Daniel Rad-
cliffe stars in a play on
the West End, Potter-
heads march directly to
the theatre. Likewise,
