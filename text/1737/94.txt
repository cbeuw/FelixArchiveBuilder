“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-

these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
Since 2003, Movember has funded more than 1,250 men’s health projects around the world, challenging the
status quo, shaking up men’s health research, and transforming the way health services reach and support men.

T
his November,
you may have
been wondering
why a male
housemate had grown a
moustache that looked
more like a cappuccino
stain than facial hair or
why those loud blokes
in ties in the union bar
on a Wednesday were
somehow looking more
handsome than usual.
It was because across
Imperial and the UK, men
had been growing facial
hair to raise awareness
and money for Movember.
Movember is a leading
charity targeting three
key issues at the heart of
the men’s health crisis,
funding projects tackling
prostate cancer, testicular
cancer, mental health, and
suicide prevention. The
lack of awareness and
funding for these issues
have now seen one man
dying of suicide every
minute of every day, with
males accounting for 75%
of all suicides. This is
“The lack of
awareness and
funding for
these issues
have now seen
one man dying
of suicide
every minute ”
why ICURFC has gotten
behind this cause and
raised just shy of £1,500,
with a big shout out to
Rohit Rajasegaran on both
an impressive moustache
and personally raising
£350 for this charity.

the UK will be affected

for students, but sport
creates a very informal
and engaging environ-
ment where teammates
can find support amongst
one another on and off the
field.
I think the best way
to show this is with a
personal example, as
some may find it hard
to believe that finding
yourself 4 weekly food
shop’s worth of student
loan poorer with a VK
hangover that could kill a
small elephant after ACC
could be of any benefit to
your mental health.
This week for me,
Wednesday was sand-
wiched between a com-
puting exam on Monday
and a 30-page design
report deadline on Friday,
so losing a whole Wednes-
day afternoon to rugby
did not seem ideal. Maybe
it was the fact we were
playing in Regent’s Park
and not Harlington, but 22
3rd XV ICURFC players
put deadlines aside to
will be the best part of
the day. Everyone around
the table celebrating the
season so far, trying to
forget the watered down
£4.89 pints, was a great
reminder to me of the
community in ICURFC
and sport societies
across Imperial. If you
have found you have
not committed to a sport
society this term, get to a
training session next year
- new players are always
welcome.

Imperial College Men’s Rugby take on Movember and
Mental Health
In 2016, elite rugby
players, such as James
Haskell, shared their own
personal experiences with
depression and anxiety
for a campaign with the
Rugby Players Associa-
tion (RPA).
This #LiftTheWeight
drive saw a 130% increase
in the number of players
contacting the RPA
counselling services and
I believe this really shows
the impact of addressing
mental health in sport.
Improved mood and a
more balanced lifestyle
are obvious benefits for
how physical activity can
boost mental wellbeing,
but sport can also fill a
gap in young people’s
health care. Academic
