The End of a Decade: Spain
POLITICS

T
he last decade
has been a period
of historical
changes in Spain
that have transformed its
political culture and soci-
ety forever. This historical
phase is parallel to the
European economic crisis
and its aftermath, which
were particularly intense
in Southern European
countries like Spain.
Arguably, most of the
last decade’s events were
ultimately motivated by
this unstable setting.
2010 was the last year
of PSOE’s (social demo-
cratic party) government
after the 2008 crisis.

is called today 15-M. For
many historians it marked
the end of the old demo-
cratic era of Spain.
Months later, general
elections were held and
PP (right-wing party)
won. During this legisla-
ture emeritus King Juan
Carlos I abdicated in his
son Felipe VI, after a cor-
ruption case involving the
royal family. Under these
political circumstances
two new parties entered
the scene: Ciudadanos
(centre) and Podemos
(left, born out of 15-M).
The 2015 elections consti-
tuted the end of the bipar-
tisan parliament, but after
not being able to form a
governing majority, elec-
tions were held again in
2016 and PP managed to
stay in power.

The End of a Decade: Italy
T
he past decade
has witnessed a
proper political
earthquake in
Italian politics: what
once was is no more. The
political framework that
has been in place since the
nineties has fallen – the
abrupt political changes
that have occurred are
similar to the previous
largescale reshaping
of the political system.
Indeed, three decades
ago, the dissolution of
the two main parties, the
Italian Communist Party
(PCI) and the Christian
Democracy (DC) was
regarded as the end of
the First Republic, which
was formed after WWII.

Nowadays, the recent
change in the political
system is said to be the
fall of the Second Italian
Republic, and the birth of
the Third one.
Let us review this step-
by-step: at the beginning
of the decade, Italy was
still recovering from the
dire economic situation
caused by the 2008 finan-
cial crisis. Under these
circumstances, the Presi-
dent of the Republic asked
PM Silvio Berlusconi to
resign and asked for the
formation of a national
unity government, a co-
alition containing almost
all parties, so that the
economic crisis could
be faced as a cohesive
government body rather
than a fractured one. In
2011 economist Mario
Monti was chosen to take
Silvio Berlusconi’s place.
His government helped
restore creditors’ trust in
Italy, but his application
of austerity measures
following EU directives
plus the sluggish reprise
of the country’s growth
made him a polarising
figure, with people either
supporting his auster-
ity policies or deeply
condemning them. This
resulted in a hung Parlia-
ment following the 2013
elections. Ultimately,
centre-left Democratic
Party (PD) formed a
government with a group
of dissident MPs who
had left Berlusconi’s cen-
tre-right party.
The most characteris-
tic figure in this period
has certainly been PD’s
young Secretary Matteo
Renzi, who initially had
vast popularity, but later
lost much of his approval
after the result of a Con-
stitutional Referendum
proposed by his party.
This referendum, which
was focused on possibly
reforming the legislative
branch, took place in
2016 and was a striking
defeat for Renzi. In 2018,
new elections saw instead
the impressive success
of two populist parties,
the Five Star Movement
and the League. The
latter is led by Matteo
Salvini, who managed
to shift many moderate
voters of Berlusconi to
the more right-wing views
of his own party. Both
Salvini and the Five Star
Movement profited off of
Italians’ distrust of insti-
tutions, which stems from
prolonged economic stag-
nation, with Italy trailing
other European and G7
countries in growth (last
year just 0.9% of GDP).
These two parties orig-
inally wanted to form
a coalition, but internal
tensions and Salvini’s
desire for new elections,
given his party’s roaring
numbers in recent polls,
collapsed the coalition.
This paved the way for
the current government
formed between PD and
the Five Star Movement
itself.
Whilst uncertainty and
volatile coalitions have
been a constant in Italian
politics, a further change
may therefore soon await
us: the new majority
seems indeed to be as
tense and unstable as its
predecessors, and the
eventuality of elections
seems therefore to be
more plausible from day
to day.
Meanwhile, the inde-
pendence movement in
Catalonia (North-Eastern
area of Spain), a phenom-
enon that has centuries of
history, had been strength-
eningandseparatistparties
had formed a majority in
the Catalonian parliament.
In 2017, Catalonia`s gov-
ernment held an illegal
independence referendum
and declared the forma-
tion of the Republic of
Catalonia. The Spanish
central government inter-
vened with armed forces
and separatist political
leaders fled the country
after being sentenced to
prison for rebellion and
have not come back since.
In 2018, a no confi-
dence vote against PP
was put forward due to
the many corruption cases
uncovered during their
legislature. After a year of
provisional government,
elections were held giving
a majority to PSOE, but
their inability to reach an
agreement with Unidas
Podemos led to another set
of elections in November.
PSOE won again and have
agreed to form a coalition
with Unidas Podemos
after the threat of the rise
of VOX (alt-right party).
This last decade of
Spanish politics witnessed
the end of the old political
system, exposed the fra-
gility of the social struc-
ture and demonstrated the
necessity of addressing
Catalonia’s separatism.
We begin this new decade
with the possibility of a
left government, a chance
for change and a future of
democratic prosperity.

unprepared and resulted
in historic unemployment

This situation resulted
