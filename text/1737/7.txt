Space: The Final Frontier
NEWS
Henry Alman
Editor-in-Chief
T
he College has,
in recent years,
struggled with
the amount
of space available on
the South Kensington
campus, and is separately
making decisions like the
sale of St. Mary’s and the
construction of White
City – but projects are
still ongoing to optimise
the space available. One
such project is the Space
Sharing Programme,
sponsored by Chris
Banks, the Director of
Library Services and
Assistant Provost (Space).
The programme aims
to investigate the potential
for sharing space between
departments and facul-
ties within the College,
when space is not being
used by a department, it
should be available for
use by somebody else,
whether for teaching,
meetings, conferences, or
student study space. The
current system means
that each department
owns and manages its
own space with a very
high degree of agency,
which is then often inac-
cessible to others. Sharing
potentially addresses the
space shortage problem,
and recent investment
in teaching spaces is
beginning to address the
disparity of quality of
available space.
While the potential
benefits are clear, there
are also drawbacks
and concerns from the
departmental side. For
example, should a space
be shared, whose respon-
sibility is it to clean it up,
to maintain it, or to pay
to replace equipment?
The programme seeks to
address these concerns
by establishing behav-
ioural expectations or
standards with regard to
room sharing and usage;
however, gaining ‘mutual
buy-in’ from departments
has been a challenge,
which is needed to get this
type of project started. As
Chris puts it, “sharing is
caring”.
One example includes
construction plans for
White City, in which a
colossal joint basement
floor was proposed which
would connect through
multiple buildings and
departments as a linked
space, available for
learning, meeting, exams,
events and the like.
The plan was not taken
forward, and instead each
building is a separate
entity; the opportunity
for shared space was not
followed through.
There are two major
ongoing projects as part
of the programme: one on
data collection, dubbed
‘Occupancy Insights’,
which tracks WiFi con-
nections throughout the
College to determine
room usage; and another
on developing and imple-
menting a new system for
room bookings.
Occupancy Insights
is still in an early imple-
mentation stage, with
only a few people from
across the College having
access to the growing data
set. The project is being
taken slowly, as there is
a concern with the data
might be misinterpreted
or used to ‘name and
shame’ people for un-
der-utilisation of space.
Chris stressed that this is
not the aim – the idea is to
gain solid data on usage to
inform decision making
and planning, which is an
area the College needs to
improve on at a wide and
holistic level.
The data has many
potential uses. It can show
whether a large space
is being booked for too
few students, or whether
space is being booked
out for too long – such as
blocking out three hours
for seminars that end after
only two. On the more
nuanced level, it can shed
light on whether the utili-
sation gap – the 13% dif-
ference between current
utilisation and the goal
of 35% - is actually more
reasonable than it first
appears. For example, the
wind tunnel in the Roderic
Hill building takes up a
colossal amount of space
and will only play host to
a small amount of people
at once, even though it
provides high value.
It can also help to
optimise timetabling – if,
hypothetically, there is
heavy underutilisation in
9-10am slots, it might be
possible to expand student
numbers and just schedule
more lectures, labs, and
tutorials in 9-10am slots.
The data is also aiding
Chris in supporting the bid
for converting basement
space in the library, which
could accommodate a
large group study area
for an extra 200 students.
The data has also been
used recently to determine
the effectiveness of a fire
evacuation drill.
There is also a long-
term intent to use the data
set for modelling purposes
– if the College can predict
the effect of planned
changes to curriculums,
or more ambitiously the
flow of students around
hypothetical White City
construction plans, then
it allows for optimisation
before issues even arise.
The room booking
system revitalisation is
also aimed at smoothing
processes across depart-
ments. Currently, the
high agency of faculties
and their ownership
of space has led to the
development of at least
13 different systems
across the College for
room booking and related
processes, each used ex-
clusively within a limited
range of departments or
buildings. This makes
space sharing virtually
impossible. Additionally,
most of those systems
have human elements as a
fundamental component,
and are often administered
via email. Chris describes
it as a “noisy process”;
one that is frustrated by
human error, in which
visibility and accessibility
are limited, and which
collapses as soon as an in-
dividual goes on holiday.
There are also regular
problems with dou-
ble-booking through
different sources, as
two different programs
are used to book for
teaching purposes and
for conferencing and
events – CELCAT and
KX, respectively. Each of
these can be used to book,
but bookings from each
can overlap. A systems
fix for this would be ex-
pensive and would incur
a large technical debt,
and so again the focus is
on establishing protocol
changes that may ensure
problems such as dou-
ble-booking do not arise.
However, the potential
long-term end-goal is
much more ambitious.
The aim is to explore
the development of a
‘one-stop shop’ system,
in which every room in
College is visible and
bookable. Additionally, it
would feature the ability
to search for free rooms
based on certain criteria,
such as facilities in the
room or size. Chris also
added: “my end goal is
absolutely to get more
rooms viewable and
bookable by students as
well”, for study purposes.
She also mentioned that
James Medler, the former
DPCS who developed the
new interface for room
bookings for the Union,
is working on the project
– creating visualisations
of how the different room
booking systems across
the College currently
interconnect.
One of the problems
with long-term projects at
the College is managing to
effectively communicate
with students. Although
consultations may be
run, the student turnover
year-on-year often means
that most of a current
cohort remain unaware
of any improvements and
changes being worked on,
leading to frustration.
Chris said: “We’re
aware of the potential for
information overload, so
we need to choose the
pointatwhichwereengage
– either for further consul-
tation or to inform people
that something is actually
happening. If there is a
big clamour, ‘why is no
one doing anything about
X’, I’d certainly like to be
able to say we are doing
something about it. The
information is there. But
balancing the communi-
cations with timeliness,
with everything else that’s
going on and everything
we have got to deliver,
is difficult. We want to
deliver – but we can’t just
flick a switch.”
“Nobody comes into
work to do a bad job. It’s
not that, but rather people
being frustrated. We’re
in a situation with 20+
departments doing things
20+ ways, and in some
ways have made things
difficult for ourselves,
which is why we are
trying to optimise process-
es and expand systems to
include things like student
bookings. A lot of this
work is about surfacing
those differences, and
seeing if we can establish
a process and direction for
improvement, to make the
whole thing much simpler
– but it takes a lot of time
and resource to do so.”

“Imperial
currently only
manages space
utilisation of
around 22%”
in order to allow for a
growing student cohort.
The overall student
numbers at Imperial have
increased by almost 20%
in the last five years,
between the 2013-14 and
2018-19 academic years.
Currently, teaching
space in the College
appears heavily un-
derutilised as a whole.
The national Research
England benchmark is
currently for space to be
utilised at 35%, calculat-
ed on the hours a room
is available, time spent
using the room and how
full the room is during
use – but Imperial only
manages around 22%
based on recent data.
The concept is that
