It is not Corbyn that we should be blaming
but Labour centrists
The refusal of some powerful centre-left figures in the party has crippled the electoral position
of the Labour party, to the detriment of the entire country.

I
t is now a truism to
say that the British
electorate is shift-
ing its allegiances
more than ever before. A
swathe of Labour strong-
holds, stretching from
North Wales across the
Midlands and the North,
the so called red wall, is
looking shaky. Seats like
Don Valley in Yorkshire, a
former coal mining area,
that has returned Labour
MPs since the 20’s are
predicted to fall to the
Tories on 12th December.
Polling, focus groups,
and news reports tell the
same story. The people
of these areas do not trust
Corbyn. They see him as
a member of the left-wing
London elite that cares
more for the people of
Venezuela or the IRA than
ensuring their economic
prosperity. They dislike
his disdain of the armed
forces and despair at
the muddled Labour
policy that would likely
overturn the result of the
referendum that they so
comprehensively voted
for. As a result, sections
of the electorate that once
would rather have died
than vote Tory, will think
twice before crossing the
box next to the red rose.
Much of this, however,
is not Corbyn’s fault. His
preferred policy platform,
present in a diluted form
in the Labour manifesto is
oneofeasingtheeconomic
burden of the least well
off in society by imposing
a much heavier burden on
the wealthy. This is an ad-
mirable goal and essential
in a climate of mounting
inequality. Other elements
of the manifesto such as
the National Education
Service to help workers
retrain for new careers that
didn’t exist in their youth
or providing high-speed
broadband to the entire
nation are well thought
out policies to help the
people living in ‘red wall’
areas. However, these
are not the policies that
are cutting through and
reaching the electorate.
They are tertiary issues in
an election that can only
be about one thing.
Corbyn’s foreign
policy quirks could have
been forgiven as long as
he stayed firm on the one
issue that mattered. On
this he failed by allowing
Labour, after months of
internal wrangling, to
define itself as a party of
Remain with numerous
caveats.
This complicated
Brexit policy has allowed
the Tories to define this
election as another run of
the 2016 EU referendum
and the polling suggests
that history will repeat
itself. This is not Corbyn’s
fault. A long term Eu-
rosceptic, he has voted
against every European
treaty and for the EU
referendum, breaking the
Labour whip to do so.
He has long regarded the
EU as a neoliberal project
that helps employers
undermine the ability of
workers to bargain with
their employers for better
conditions. What power,
he asks, does a workforce
have if they can be easily
replaced by immigrants
from Eastern Europe?
When it comes to Brexit,
Corbyn is far more in
tune with the voters of the
north than many would
believe. So why has
Labour chosen to follow
such a muddled policy of
renegotiating a deal that
it would then campaign
against?
It has been the centrist,
moderate and metropol-
itan MPs, the darlings of
the metropolitan left that
are responsible for this
betrayal of Labour’s base.
Moderate MPs such as Sir
Keir Starmer and Emily
Thornberry who sit on the
front bench with folded
arms and amused smiles
that say ‘we all know he is
mad but once we lose the
election he will be gone
and it will be business as
usual’have forgotten what
the party known as Labour
was established to do.
The majority of them
are London MPs who
have nothing but disdain
for the people of the
North. Complaints of
schools being full up and
no jobs are dismissed
with a waggled finger as
xenophobia by lawyers
and union officials more
used to Westminster than
Yorkshire.
Their politics are not
those of coal miners and
strikes. They represent a
new generation of facile
left-wing thought found
largely in students and
people working in right-on
fields such as media or
creative industries. They
believe in freedom of
movement, hate speech
and everyone being nice
to each other which are
not issues that poll well in
the red wall. These politi-
cians have presumed that
the north would always
vote for Labour and so
have become indifferent
to their concerns and
dismissive of their needs
and this is finally being
rewarded by voters.
A weak and divided
Labour has perpetuated
the Brexit fiasco for
three years and allowed a
zombie Tory government
to limp on. Rebel MPs
should back their leader
and put their case to the
people as strongly as they
can or leave the party and
join another party or set up
on own. The smug rebels
need a reality check.
The Labour Red Wall are seats that are threatened by a Tory swing // Felix
The Red Wall
The so-called ‘Red
Wall’includes many of the
old Labour strongholds
like Great Gimsby, Work-
ington, that is famously
being challenged by the
Tories, and Don Valley.
Many of these seats have
non-local MPs who have
been given a safe seat as
a reward. Don Valley in
Yorkshire, for example,
is the seat of former Blair
cabinet member Caroline
Flint who grew up in
London. Many of these
seats voted heavily to
leave the European Union
and it is predicted that a
swing of 9% to the Tories
would be sufficient to
deliver a working majority
of at least 28 to Boris
Johnson. At the moment
the polls suggest that this
will occur, kicking Labour
veteran Dennis Skinner
out of his seat.
