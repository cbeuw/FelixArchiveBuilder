Your Union is Standing Firm
Union President Abhijay Sood reassures students that the Union is continuing to work hard to
represent you despite the recent staffing and kitchen issues
COMMENT
Abhijay Sood
Union President
T
here’s no doubt
that this has been
a tricky term for
the Union. Our
most senior member of
staff is stepping down,
the kitchens are closed,
and student officers, in
particular the deputy pres-
idents, have had to work
overtime to compensate
for understaffing in the
office.
Despite this, the Union
is standing firm. We’re
triaging our issues, so we
know what needs to be
addressed immediately
and what we can take time
over. We’re recruiting new
staff across all our direc-
torates, with at least one
student officer on every
interview panel. Through
all this, we’re maintaining
our commitment to rep-
resenting the interests of
students to improve our
collective experience at
Imperial. On h-bar, space
on campus, UG and PG
student satisfaction, halls
rent, ethical investment,
and so much more, we’re
working hard to make
sure your voice is heard,
and that students come
first when decisions are
being made at Imperial.
We welcome the help
the College is offering us
at the moment, and much
of it should continue once
our immediate issues are
resolved. But it’s impor-
tant that we retain our
autonomy, so that when
the dust settles, the voice
of students hasn’t been
weakened. We want to
work together as partners
resolving a common
issue, a frame of refer-
ence I know many senior
members of staff in the
College agree with.
Whatever our challeng-
not being oppositional for
its own sake, but firmly
and constructively raising
issues where we don’t
agree with what’s being
done. Wherever possible,
we want to find ways we
can collaborate, and make
decisions that benefit
students, staff, and senior
management, without
compromising our under-
lying principles.
On ethical investment,
this has meant finding
a way to have tough
conversations about the
consequences of where
Imperial puts its money.
On halls rent, it has meant
going back to the College
and telling them that
what’s being proposed is
unacceptable to students,
and that we need to do
something different.
In both of these cases,
though it has caused some
discomfort on both sides,
we’ve found a way to
push forward together: a
working group where we
have equal footing with
staff for the former, and
a full negotiation without
predetermined confines
for the latter.
However, our ability to
do anything meaningful as
a Union depends largely
on the extent to which
other students are willing
to act. If they don’t feel
they can do anything, we
can only do whatever our
skills in persuasion and
the goodwill of individual
staff members allows.
However, if they’re
willing to get involved,
our ability to make mean-
ingful change multiplies.
For now, that mainly
means spreading the word.
Tell a friend about the
dispute over halls rent
or the push on ethical
investment (see the
articles on pages 4 & 5).
If you’d like to do more,
on rent: fill in the register
of interest at tiny.cc/
rentregister; on ethical
investment: consider
making a written sub-
mission to sri.policy@
imperial.ac.uk with
your thoughts on where
Imperial should and
shouldn’t be investing
its money.
Together, we have
an opportunity to make
some real changes to the
way Imperial works; I
hope that’s something
we can take advantage
of this year.

oppositional
for its own
sake, but
