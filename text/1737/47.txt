MASTERMIND
Another puzzle contribution, this time by DoC’s Duncan White - Mastermind! (The puzzle, not the movie or
TV show!) Do be warned though, this is a hard one! Try out easier variations here:
https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dcw/Mastermind.pdf
Instructions:
Try to guess the secret 5-colour code, made up of 5 colours, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red or Green. A black peg
means an exactly correct colour - the correct colour in the correct place. Of course, you are not told which
position(s) contain the correct colour, simply how many positions contain the correct colour. You are given
a white peg for a misplaced colour - the correct colour but in a diﬀerent place! We have already gone ahead
and given you 3 guesses, which will lead you to a unique solution! (Try the easier ones first!)
