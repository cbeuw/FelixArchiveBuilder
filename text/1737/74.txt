T
he entry of the
new millennium
was accompa-
nied by a major
stock market crash caused
by a bubble known as
the Dotcom bubble. The
last decade of the 20th
century saw the advent of

index. In the span of five
years, Nasdaq grew from
just under 1,000 units in
1995 to 5,000 in 2000.
Its peak of 5,048.62 was
recorded on March 10th
,
2000. Various factors are
considered responsible for
making the bubble finally
pop, including a raise of
interest rates by the US
Federal Reserve along
with analysts’ belief that
investing in technology
sector should no longer be
prioritised.
By March of next year,
the US economy had
entered a recession. Fol-
lowing the tragic events of
September 2001, the era
of the dotcom companies
officially ended, as no
Initial Public Offerings
(IPOs) from technology
firms were filed.
Underlying Causes of
the Crash
The most important
question is, what were
the underlying causes of
the crash? The investing
community’s persistence
in pouring money into
unprofitable Internet start-
ups appears as the root of
the problem. The astonish-
ing success of firms such
as Amazon and eBay led
several entrepreneurs to
believing that the creation
of a web-based company
was a path of guaranteed
success, which explains
the overly large number
of dotcoms entering the
stock market.
Aspiring wealth-crea-
tors were not the only ones
captured by that belief;
this sentiment governed
investors’ thinking to a
large degree. Consequent-
ly, they began to disregard

ing, including analysing
business plans and price to
earnings ratios. Instead of
focusing on how start-ups
could generate revenue,
analysts instead focused
on irrelevant aspects
of their operation and
derived unrealistic models
related to future cash flow.
As expected, the
overabundance of capital
resulted in an unreasona-
ble number of “dotcoms”
going public. In order to
become successful, these
companies sought to
differentiate themselves
from the pack through
marketing. It has been
reported that some
devoted more than 90%
of their budget to adver-
tising! This approach
was unsustainable as the
majority of these firms
had yet to form a sustain-
able business model. Even
more astonishing, some
had not finalised their
products upon issuing
their IPOs!
The combination
of these tendencies
constituted a recipe for
disaster. What is perhaps
more unfortunate is
that certain voices had
realised the boom could
not be sustained, such as
Alan Greenspan, the then
Chairman of the Federal
Reserve. He cautioned
against over-investing in
the technology sector at
the end of 1996. However,
his choice to adopt a lax
monetary policy until
early 2000 was heavily
criticised by multiple
analysts as it only helped
accelerate the formation
of the Dotcom bubble.Ac-
cording to their thinking,
a tighter monetary policy
could have helped contain
the situation.
Will a new bubble
burst?
Many people are also
wondering, will a new
tech bubble burst? There
are definitely signs which
could be interpreted as a
warning for a new Dotcom
bubble. Just like in the
1990s, a large number of
tech companies are going
public with overly high
valuations. Some of them
the World Wide Web and
the Personal Computer.
These technological
developments led to the
creation of numerous
startups, many of which
had a “.com” attached at
the end of their name.
Continuous investment
into these companies
resulted in an exponential
rise of their equity valu-
ations by the end of the
1990s. That can be easily
confirmed by Figure 1,
depicting the variations in
the value of the technol-
ogy-dominated Nasdaq

reported that

budget to

have filed for IPOs despite
the fact they have not yet
been able to generate
profits.
For instance, Survey
Monkey, a well-known
business software
company, issued an IPO
in August of 2018 seeking
to raise close to $100.
million. In the first half
of the year, it recorded a
net loss of $27.18 million.
Similar cases include the
cloud provider Dropbox
and the firm DocuSign,
which creates software
for digitally signing doc-
uments, among others. It
is also worth noting that
2018 became a record
“A large
