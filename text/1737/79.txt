Brussel sprouts get a
lot of hate but that’s
only because it’s usu-
ally cooked poorly. A
well-cooked side of
brussel sprouts is a
thing of wonder. I like
to render some bacon
lardons (or pancetta if
you’re fancy) and then
throw in my brussel
sprout halves, letting
them fry without dis-
turbing them so they
can develop a deli-
cious char. Seasoned
with fennel seeds and
a pinch of paprika,
these brussel sprouts
will really change your
world for the better.
Carrots and parsnips
are also pretty tradi-
tional and I like to
cut them into sticks
and roast them with
a honey glaze. Peel-
ing a mountain of
carrots and parsnips
with friends can prove
surprisingly fun if you
have the right festive
atmosphere going.
Treat yourself to some
carrots by dipping
them in hummus for a
snack because prepar-
ing all this food will
definitely make you
peckish but you don’t
want to fill up before
dinner.
What takes a good
Christmas dinner
to a great Christmas
dinner is the variety
and quality of sides.
While it may impress
your guests to make
everything from
scratch, we feel that
this is where you can
slack off and seek help
from the supermarket
overlords. Pick up a
packet of pigs in blan-
kets or paxo stuffing
- honestly, it tastes fine
and is just so easy to
make.
This is truly where
Now it’s time to fin-
ish the night off on a
high note. If you’ve
followed our advice,
there should be a sea
of unbuckled belts
and undone buttons
just under the table.
As tempting as it is to
end with a bang, now
may not be the best
time to flex your triple
chocolate cake recipe.
Fruit-centred treats
are the more suitable
choice after such a
filling meal.
An apple crumble
is a tried and tested
hit in situations like
this. They are easy to
make from scratch
and also work great
as comfort food after
one too many plates
of seconds. Just make
sure you have cus-
tard. Lots of custard.
Don’t bother making
from scratch, there’s a
pre-made custard for
every budget out there
and now’s not the time
to risk making sweet
scrambled eggs by
accident.
Sometimes it’s best
to keep it simple and
just go with a fruit
salad and bring out
the cream. You’ve
been slaving over a hot
stove all day so this
would be a dream to
make and consume.
Of course, we’ve got to
mention the tradition-
al desserts like Christ-
mas pudding or a dec-
orated yule log (think
giant mini-rolls).
These are delicious but
difficult to do right.
If you really want to
attempt these, make in
advance! I would warn
against making Christ-
mas pudding purely
because you’ll have to
buy extra equipment
which rarely comes in
useful otherwise.
There are two drinks
synonymous with
Christmas in England:
eggnog and mulled
wine. Because I’m not
a massive fan of wine,
I don’t have much to
say regarding the latter.
The former, previously
known as “milk punch”,
requires careful cook-
ing. A mixture of hot
milk steeped in spices
is slowly added to egg
yolks beaten with sugar
to temper the eggs and
the resulting liquid has
to be heated (but never
boiled). Although a
little bit annoying to
make, it’s a decadent
treat for Christmas.
Just make sure to add
a generous amount of
cinnamon and gin-
ger to either recipe
to warm everyone up
because baby, it’s cold
outside. You see what I
did there.
Other than that, you
can have any drink
you’d like. Just remem-
ber you’re in halls
and no one wants to
be subject to a Jäger-
bomb-fuelled rampage
in the corridor!

vegetarians can re-
joice as well. Let your
imagination run free!
Stuff those mushrooms
with cheese and top
with breadcrumbs or
stick some peeled-
and-halved onions in
the oven while you’re
roasting your main
to get a sweet and
unctuous caramel-
ised onion. Toss some
chopped-up walnuts
with apple pieces along
with nutmeg and other
christmassy spices for
a festive salad or, to go
full fancy, do a baked
apple with chestnut
and sage.
