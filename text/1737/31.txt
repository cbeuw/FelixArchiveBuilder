Let me be your star - MTSoc Revue: Review
S
ometimes all it
takes to fall in love
with a musical is
that one special
song or moment. MTSoc’s
medley of musical classics
hopes to scratch that itch
with over fifteen musicals
represented! With more
than 45 performers taking
part in the show in small
groups, the audience was
transported across the mu-
sical theatre universe in
short, snappy songs, with
some being a little more
memorable than others.
Daria Ditri’s solo
performance in the song
“Portrait of a Princess”
from Unwritten Songs was
one of the highlights of the
night. The song itself is a
quite daring, combining
Disney princess stereo-
types with much dirtier
humour. It takes a lot to
be able to sing in a Snow
White-esqe voice while
pretending to pleasure
your prince charming and
not make it look a little
awkward. Luckily for the
audience, Ditri executed
the performance wonder-
fully. With a very strong
voice and impeccable
comedic timing, her per-
formance was one of the
most memorable, despite
being one of the few songs
performed solo,.
“His Work and Nothing
More” from Jekyll &
Hyde was another really
strong performance.
Sebastian Berger, Paul
Monaghan, Celine
Driessen and Sam Win-
iarski managed to pull off
this difficult song through
masterful coordination
and amazing vocals. The
real highlight of the first
act, was the visually and
vocally striking “Hellfire”
from The Hunchback of
Notre Dame. When robed
men carrying candles
slowly marched onto the
stage from the audience
followed by Daniella
Gimbosh’s mesmerizing
dancing, you knew good
things are to come. From
the moment Jonathan
Hedley sang the first note,
the audience was silent as
his deep enchanted voice
captures everyone in the
room. Even more so than
his singing, it was his
ability to sell the character
he was portraying that
made his performance so
remarkable.
In medley shows, it can
be a little weird jumping
through completely dif-
ferent plots and moods,
so performers have to
fully commit to each act.
Unfortunately, sometimes
committing simply isn’t
enough. For example
with Manuel Pestana
Gageiro’s performance of
“Never Ever Getting Rid
of Me” from Waitress.
Despite truly embodying
the character and selling
the story to the audience,
a combination of sound
issues and a lack of enun-
ciation meant that most of
the jokes were lost. Fixing
these issues could have
made what was a great
performance brilliant.
There were many other
amazing performances
from musicals such
as Hamilton and Six.
However, the standout
ones mentioned above
all had something
in common, they all
followed the rule that less
is more. When it comes to
coordinating over twenty
performers on stage, for
example during the Hair-
spray classic You Can’t
Stop the Beat, even if the
performers and audience
are having a blast, things
have a tendency to look
messy. During these
bigger dance numbers, the
performers with a dance
background stood out,
like the very talented and
graceful Ella Reich.
On the whole, this was
a fun show to watch for
musical theatre fans and
novices alike, with plenty
of talent on display. Keep
your eyes peeled for
MTSoc’s next show!
DramSoc’s Macbeth scores a MacB-
I
don’t remember
much about Macbeth,
having only studied
it briefly in my
early secondary school
days. While I may have
forgotten the plot and the
characters’ names, I could
never forget the feeling
of empowerment I expe-
rienced after learning of
my king-slayer potential
wrought from the circum-
stances of my caesarean
birth.? You may have your
full-term, spontaneous
vaginal deliveries but I
was born to topple tyran-
nous regimes.
Macbeth, with its bub-
bling cauldrons, moving
forests, and ferocious in-
ter-clan warring, is a play
that demands powerful
visuals and creative use of
the theatre space. Unfor-
tunately, DramSoc’s pro-
duction just didn’t deliver.
Using budget constraints
as an excuse can only get
you so far in explaining
the complete lack of at-
tention to aesthetic and
design. The backdrops,
vital in transporting the
audience to specific set-
tings, were merely pieces
of card stuck together to
form shapeless, detail-less
canvases. One might as
well lower green screens
instead and have the au-
dience imagine a castle
wall. The costumes, if you
could call black t-shirts
and jeans a costume, were
disappointing even by col-
lege production standards.
Bizarrely, the witches
were dressed as post-war
office secretaries, further
adding to the directorial
confusion surrounding
the production. The lack
of finish may have been
acceptable in primary
school but given Imperi-
al’s talented student pop-
ulation, the wealth of art/
fashion clubs, and the
members’own purchasing
power, the show should
not have ended up looking
so nightmarishly amateur.
The acting, for the
most part, was fine. Yuyu
Lee played the titular role
well, if a little too cheer-
fully pre-regicide. While
his labile mood may have
out of place for the griz-
zled war veteran we were
introduced to at the be-
ginning. There were two
standout performances for
me. Nick Twyman, play-
ing King Duncan, was a
delight to watch, expertly
delivering his lines with
style and warmth. It is
one thing to understand
and regurgitate the lines
of a Shakespeare play,
quite another to speak
each word as though it is
spontaneous thought. The
other standout was Valerie
Lau. While Twyman gave
a comfortable, laid back
performance, Lau brought
forth the opposite. Her
MacDuff, trembling with
righteous fury after the
slaughter of his family,
carried the second act
with a dramatic intensity
befitting a larger stage and
a better sword.
It is unfortunate that
the talent on stage was
let down by such poor di-
rection. Even the lighting
and sound were poorly
utilised. Prop movement
and scene-changes were
coordinated poorly with
blackouts and sound ef-
fects were so sporadic that
it distracted rather than
supported the action on
stage.
In the end, there was
little to commend in this
production of Macbeth
save the cast. Next time
DramSoc puts on a show,
I hope they’re willing to
at least shell out the £2 for
retractable prop knives.

A tale of failed delivery (and I’m not talking about MacDuff). Maybe an early abortion would’ve been kinder.
