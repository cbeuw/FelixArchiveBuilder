I
t has been confirmed
that Jon Tucker, the
Business School’s
Faculty Operating
Officer, will be providing
interim support to the
Union following the de-
parture of the Managing
Director.
The decision was made
after a discussion with
College by Jill Finney,
the Chair of the Union’s
Board of Trustees, the
group whose responsi-
bility it is to oversee the
Union’s activities. The
Board was consulted
via email and telephone
about the decision, in the
absence of a scheduled
meeting, but retains the
ability to overturn it at the
next Board meeting on
Tuesday 10th December.
Jill clarified that the
decision needed to be
made swiftly such that
the organisation could
continue to function,
hence not waiting for
the next meeting. “That
we haven’t had a Board
meeting does not mean
the Board should not take
action on an issue that
needs to be dealt with
rapidly; it has to respond
regardless of when the
meetings are fixed.”
The Board will also
discuss the timeline for
recruiting a new full-time
Managing Director, as
well as receiving a pres-
entation from Jon on how
he envisions his role in
the organisation.
The decision has
prompted queries about
the Union’s ability to be
effective in advocating
for students if the College
is actively engaged
in the Union’s senior
management. Regarding
the choice to approach
College to ask for recom-
mendations, rather than
searching externally, Jill
said that “this was the
most expedient model for
ensuring student and staff
support in the short-term.”
She also emphasised that
“there are clear lines
between College helping
us to be an independent
robust Union, and the
Union’s ability to negoti-
ate and to take on issues.
They are completely di-
visible, just as discussions
about Union finances
do not interfere with the
ongoing negotiation about
halls fees.”
Abhijay Sood, the
Union President, offered
clarity on Jon’s position
within the Union: “Jon
has a lot of experience
with how both business
and charities function,
so we want to play to his
strengths and have him
advise us on how to rectify
some of the foundational
challenges the Union is
facing at the moment.
He is not an interim
Managing Director, he
is not a Chief Operating
Officer. He is not here to
tell us what to do, he is
here to tell us what we can
do in terms of what will be
effective. He is advising
and mostly liaising to get
support from the College
on operational activities
like data protection,
recruitment, or building
maintenance. Having met
Jon, any concerns about
conflicts of interest have
very much been allayed.”
Jarlath O’Hara, the
outgoing Managing
Director, added that he
believes that this opens
new opportunities going
forwards.“Whensomeone
who is known and trusted
says to the College the
same things the Union has
been saying for a while,
maybe it will land firmer.”
He also said that Jon’s ex-
perience in the Business
School will help to offer a
“lens of consistency” with
regards to how the Union
and College interact, in
line with how the
College interacts with
faculties, on the areas
where parallels can be
drawn such as building
maintenance.
Regarding his depar-
ture, Jarlath said that this
was the least disruptive
time for him to step
down – despite the major
work ongoing with the
Union’s negotiations on
halls rent. In essence, the
reasoning behind it is a
difference of management
styles – he has a particular
method, and the Union’s
ongoing needs require
something different; a
style that he was not
interested in carrying
forward, and meant that it
was a “healthy time” for a
change and a “fresh pair
of eyes” on the Union’s
issues.
He also discussed with
Felix the troubles current-
ly facing the Union, and
the ongoing direction he
believes they need to take.
Two major issues facing
the Union in the past 12
months have been estab-
lishing their prioritisation
with regards to provision
of different services, as
well as ensuring clear
remit and accountability
both internally and with
regards to the split of
responsibilities between
themselves and College.
Examples include the
ongoing work on health
and safety issues in the
Union kitchens, as well as
general maintenance work
on the building – which
the Union is currently
liaising with the College’s
Estates division about.
Part of the reason for the
disruption has been a lack
of clear communication
and understanding about
what areas fall under
whose remit. These two
issues will be driving
factors in the Union’s new
strategy for 2020-23.
Another has been staff
turnover. Though some
directorates within the
Union have remained
stable, others have been
decimated – with the
worst-affected being the
Activities team, which
saw all three Coordinator
roles depart within a short
time-frame. Part of the
cause is, Jarlath says, a
“culture of development”
that is intrinsic to the
Union – the encourage-
ment of staff to take on
and do more. This encour-
ages progression, but with
fewer management roles
available as one moves
up the hierarchy, this
actively promotes higher
turnover, which the Union
has failed to account for in
terms of its structure and
processes. As Jarlath put
it, “if you’re going to con-
sciously fuel that cycle,
you need better things in
place to mitigate against
the turnover.”
Apossible restructuring
of the Union is therefore
on the cards having been
discussed at management
and Board level; a more
“agile” way of working
that allows flexibility
in addressing emerging
needs and changing prior-
ities.
Furthermore, criticisms
have been levied that the
Union has been too com-
pliant to the College on
issues negatively affecting
students. However, Jarlath
views this as a problem
with visibility and com-
munication. Often, the
Union will oppose the
College on issues, but
not in a publicly visible
way – a consequence of
the “collaborative” style
that he and previous
sabbatical officers have
adopted. “There are
officers and unions who
are good at shouting about
how great they are, but
don’t do a lot. It’s tough
because communicating
takes time – so you end
up having less impact in
order to communicate it,
because it takes time away
from what you’re doing.
And yet the Union suffers
reputationally from not
being visible with stuff
that happens.”
Finally, he shared what
he feels are personal suc-
cesses during his time in
the Union, and his passion
for the organisation. “In
terms of success, I view it
along the lines of what the
organisation has achieved
while I’ve been leading
staff member, not just
what I have personally
done. I am proud of intro-
ducing the Wellbeing Rep
Network, and that despite
a poor financial year last
year we are in a stronger
and healthier position
“There are
clear lines
between
College
helping
us to be
independent
and robust,
and the
Union's ability
to negotiate
issues”
“There are
officers and
unions who
are good at
shouting
about how
great they are,
but don't do a
lot”
today than when I joined
four years ago. Most of
all, I’d point to us con-
tinuing to outperform – I
know that we are the envy
of many unions, students,
and universities in terms
of our CSPs, election
turnout, systems work
with eActivities, and so
on.”
“I want to say that I’ve
had a really great expe-
rience for the last four
years. It’s a fantastic role,
a brilliant organisation,
and I think the stuff that
we do is incredible – with
‘we’ being 99% students.
It’s been a privilege to be
in this position for four
years. I’ve been in unions
for 20 years, and I abso-
lutely, coming into the
role, saw it as the pinnacle
of the student movement
– there’s no role I’d want
above it within the student
movement, and it’s felt
like that every day I was
in the role.”
