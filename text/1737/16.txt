A Decade of UK Politics

A
s the clock ticked midnight on 1st January 2010, the nation celebrated the completion of an entire decade into the new millennium.At
the time, 10 Downing Street was occupied by Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister who took the country through the global financial
crash of 2008. Brown had been part of ‘New Labour’ governments since 1997, first as Chancellor of the Exchequer and then taking
over as Prime Minister after Tony Blair. ‘New Labour’, of course, had been Blair’s political rebranding of the Labour Party in an
effort to move it away from it’s left wing past and place it firmly into the centre-ground of British politics, with even Margaret Thatcher having
said that her greatest achievement was “Tony Blair and New Labour. We forced our opponents to change their minds.”
In the wake of the global financial crash and the failure that was the Iraq War, the new Conservative Party leader David Cameron successfully
created a narrative that the state was like a household budget – and that the deficit and debt of New Labour due to the bailing out of the banks
had to be eliminated. With the Liberal Democrats also having a new leader in Nick Clegg, the stage was set for a General Election.
In this article, Ansh goes through a condensed history of the past 10 years of UK politics. With a General Election
imminent, it is time to strap in for a ride through recent history to see how we arrived to the politics of today.

The Conservatives had
been leading in the polls
consistently since Octo-
ber 2007, with by-election
and EU results to show
for it. The results: a hung
parliament with the To-
ries the largest party and
the Liberal Democrats
with enough MPs to be
the kingmakers, and after
days of talks and a con-
cession from the Tories to
hold a referendum on get-
ting rid of the First Past
The Post voting system in
favour of the Alternative
Vote (AV), the two parties
emerged as a coalition
government.
Gordon Brown re-
signed from the leader-
ship, triggering a Labour
leadership contest. The
key figures emerging were
two brothers: Ed and Da-
vid Miliband, the sons of
Marxist academic Ralph
Miliband. The Labour left
offered Dianne Abbott,
the first black woman MP
to be elected to Parlia-
ment, for the leadership,
however this campaign
was carried out with little
support. With Ed being
seen as the more left
wing candidate, and his
brother being seen very
much as a continuation
of New Labour politics,
the membership decided
it was time for a change
away from New Labour
and elected Ed.
The AV referendum
took place a year after,
and with the Lib Dems
being the only major
party to support AV, the
campaign for AV was
resoundingly rejected at
the ballot box with 68%
voting against its intro-
duction.
After the Scottish National
Party stood on a manifesto
for a referendum on Scottish
independence and won an
overwhelming victory at the
Scottish Parliament elections,
and with continued pressure
on the Coalition government
from the party, the Coalition
agreed to legislate for an
independence referendum
and worked with the Scottish
government to arrange it for
the Autumn of 2014.
Both the Tories and Labour
teamed up to make the case
for the union, promising
further devolved powers if the
people of Scotland voted to
stay in the union. Ultimately,
independence was rejected
and further devolved powers
were delivered later on. The
Scottish First Minister and
SNP leader Alex
Salmond resigned in light
of the defeat, with Nicola
Sturgeon becoming the new
SNP leader and First Minister.
The Referendum was tout-
ed as a once in a generation
vote – an attitude that would
change because of a different
referendum a couple years
down the line…
With the Coalition gov-
ernment having overseen
years of devastating cuts
to public services and
with Liberal Democrat
popularity at an all time
low, the 2015 General
Election saw Labour lead-
er Ed Miliband concede
too much to the political
centre – with an exam-
ple being the infamous
release of mugs that had
“controls on immigration”
written on them. In the
Coalition, the Lib Dems
had reneged on their
promise to students of not
increasing tuition fees –
instead tripling them to
£9k a year. Emblematic of
Labour’s response to the
Coalition, their manifesto
only proposed cutting
fees to £6k – still double
that of the fees in 2010.
With a combination of
this, and a hostile press
characterising him as
a weak leader, it is no
surprise Miliband lost the
election, even surprising
pundits and pollsters
expecting another hung
parliament but instead
Cameron had won a ma-
jority after having prom-
ised a referendum on the
UK’s membership of the
EU during the election
campaign. This decision
meant he could appease
Eurosceptic voters who
otherwise would’ve voted
for Nigel Farage’s UK In-
dependence Party (UKIP)
and split the Tory vote in
many areas, delivering
seats to the opposition.
The decision was taken
under the impression that
Cameron’s favoured side,
Remain, would easily win
the referendum. As we
are all aware, this impres-
sion proved to be fatally
incorrect.
Miliband resigned the
leadership, triggering a
fresh Labour leadership
election. With centrist/
centre-left establishment
figures like Andy Burn-
ham, Yvette Cooper, and
Liz Kendall in the race,
backbencher Jeremy
Corbyn put his hat in
the ring as the candidate
for the Labour left. Seen
widely by pundits as an
outsider with little chance
of winning, Corbyn won
by a landslide on a plat-
form of firmly rejecting
the austerity agenda and
bringing the party back to
its left wing roots.
