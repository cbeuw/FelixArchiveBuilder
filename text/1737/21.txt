Pop hits take the West End: & Juliet
A celebration of the greatest wordsmiths in history: Shakespeare, Britney Spears, and the BackStreet Boys
R
omeo and Juliet,
is probably one
of history’s
most famous
love stories which (spoiler
alert) tragically ends
in death. This modern
retelling considers what
could have happened if
Juliet (Miriam-Teak Lee)
was given a life beyond
Romeo. She travels to
Paris with an entourage
consisting of Nurse
(Melanie La Barrie) her
mother figure, and her
best friends Anne (Juliet
Cassidy Janson) and May
(Arun Blair-Mangat).
Expanding on the
universal themes of love
and tragedy found in
the original story, this
rendition puts a modern
twist on Juliet who is pre-
sented as a fully-formed,
independent woman. If
this premise seems a bit
infantile and simple at
first glance, fear not as it
is actually a story within
a story. These two parallel
stories seem a bit cliche
in the opening half, but
in the second half, this
added dimension is used
as a way of exploring
the relationship between
William Shakespeare
(Oliver Tompsett) and
Anne Hathaway - yes she
is his wife and Juliet’s
best friend, keep up! Anne
Hathaway, despite being
Shakespeare’s wife is
almost never mentioned
in his work and has never
been known historically
in her own right. This par-
allels Juliet’s characteri-
sation, simply as Romeo’s
plus one, in the original
Veronian story. Anne’s
story is explored subtly
at first, culminating in a
powerful, slightly in your
face, scene where she puts
her feelings raw for the
audience to understand.
What makes this
musical stand out, and
what will undoubtedly
make it a big success, is
“Were Ariana,
Britney, and
Kesha ever
meant to meet
Shakespeare?”
how every emotional high
and low is framed by a
modern hit by writer and
producer Max Martin.
From Ariana Grande’s
Break Free, to Britney’s
Oops!... I Did It Again,
each song fits perfectly in
it’s moment while retain-
ing a little of the absurdity.
Were Ariana, Britney and
Kesha ever meant to meet
Shakespeare?
The nurse (Melanie La
Barrie) is definitely one of
the most loved characters
by the audience. The
attitude, personality and
humour that La Barre
brings to the role is perfect
for the story.
The musical does make
a concerted effort to have
a diverse set of characters
and May played by Arun
Blair-Mangat is presented
as the token LGBTQ+.
When May bounces onto
the scene as the stereotyp-
ical gay best friend, you
could feel a few eyes roll
in the audience. It is of
course amazing to have
this type of unapologetic
representation, but this
first impression, playing
on classic stereotypes,
was disappointing. As
the story progresses and
May’s narrative is inter-
woven into the wider plot,
more complex, nuanced
characteristics are pushed
to the forefront. It was
not made overtly clear,
but after May’s heartfelt
rendition of I’m Not a
Girl, Not Yet a Woman by
Britney Spears, it seemed
that the character was
also being presented as a
one questioning their own
gender identity. A more
explicit approach, in the
style of May’s original
presentation, may have
made more of an impact
but this was nonetheless a
very welcome representa-
tion.
A special shoutout
has to be made to the set
designers and costume de-
signers on this production
as they contributed to the
killer combination of tra-
ditional with the modern.
The set was spectacular,
bringing together a double
rotating stage (move over
LesMis!)whichcouldalso
become a raised platform.
Almost every scene had a
different set which would
be seamlessly wheeled in;
the audience hardly had to
use their imagination at
all! Together, the set and
the costumes combined
the fun and glitter of a
pre-teen Jojo Siwa fan
with a more grungier aes-
thetic of the same teenager
a few years later.
Some people are quick
to turn their noses up at
those who seek to instil
a bit of modern pop fun
into the theatre world of
by creating these jukebox
musicals. However,
not only do these new
productions draw a wider
audience into the theatre
but they also tell very
important stories with
wider representation than
more traditional musicals.
If you like Shakespeare,
Ariana Grande or the
Backstreet Boys this is the
show is for you!
