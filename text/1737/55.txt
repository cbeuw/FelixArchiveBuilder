T
he roots of rock
as a genre are
buried deep in the
other sounds of
the 50s: blues, jazz, R&B
and country, amalgamated
together to form its own
unique genre, known as
rock and roll. This began
in the deep south of the
states, where the first
electric guitars began
to make a heavy impact
on music. Generally, the
accepted “first” rock and
roll number one was Bill
Haley’s ‘Rock Around
the Clock’, a classic
example of the laid-back
boogie-inspired beat, easy
enough to recreate in any
modern music classroom.
Whilst noticeable rock
and roll artists of the 50s
would also include Little
Richard and Chuck Berry,
the mid-50s hailed the
introduction of the iconic
Elvis Presley, quite possi-
bly the first “pop star” in
the world.
Whilst Presley still
dominates the early years
of 60s, rock music is
now firmly in the charts,
held there by the British
invasion of legendary
bands such as the Beatles
and the Rolling Stones.
Gradually rock and roll
evolved into different
genres of rock: psyche-
delic rock, pop rock, blues
rock and folk rock. Rock
started to become more
expressive, and as such
more political. Towards
the end of the 60s with
opposition to the Vietnam
War picking up, artists
such as Bob Dylan gain
popularity. In the UK the
streets are ravaged with
battles between Mods and
Rockers. The first live
musicfestivalshappenand
at the end of the decade
the infamous summer of
love has its soundtrack
riddled with artists such as
Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd,
the Who and the Doors.
The start of the 70s are
marked by the Beatles
breaking up and Hendrix,
Janis Joplin and Jim
Morrison all dying at the
age of 27, which relates to
a decline in psychedelic
rock and an insurgence of
hard rock, made promi-
nent by bands such as Led
Zeppelin. The 70s would
mark the introduction of
the bona fide rockstar,
with acts made big in
the 60s suddenly touring
the world in private jets.
Queen played their first
gig in our very own union.
Hard rock has a brief ebb
into glam rock, where
David Bowie and T-Rex
“Rock
started to
become more
expressive,
and as such
more political”
“A sound
heavy with
distorted
guitars, as an
evolution of
the previous
era”
crop up, before settling
down into heavy rock
with bands such as Black
Sabbath and Deep Purple.
Anger at prog rock fuels
the introduction of punk,
as made famous by the
Sex Pistols, which then
calms down into new
wave as synthesisers hit
the market.
Stemming from the late
70s, the 80s showcased
many of the rock genres
we know and love today.
New wave continued
with the Joy Division
spin-off New Order
before morphing into
new romanticism and the
plethora of bands which
accompanied it including
Roxy Music and Adam
and the Ants. Post-punk
appeared, fuelled by
bands such as Siousxie
and the Banshees, with
the genre then splitting
into goth and heavy metal.
The latter genre notably
brought forward many
bands still current today:
Iron Maiden, Metallica,
Slayer and Anthrax
amongst others.
Throughout the decade
post-punk went through a
change, with underground
bands such as the Smiths
and the Cure finding
great success and hitting
the mainstream. Towards
the end of the decade
alternative rock and its
sub-genres pop-punk and
grunge began to expand,
paving the way for the
sound of the 90s.
In the early 90s grunge
bands such as Nirvana and
Pearl Jam began emerging
from the pacific northwest
ofAmerica.Asound heavy
with distorted guitars and
little polish were an evo-
lution of the post-punk era
from the previous decade.
In the UK bands like Pulp,
Oasis and Blur took on the
grunge genre and devel-
oped into the beginning of
britpop. After the unfortu-
nate death of Kurt Cobain,
the grunge genre began to
wane in popularity trans-
forming into the more
commercially acceptable
form post-grunge. Skate/
pop-punk exploded
mid-decade thanks to
independent labels giving
the genre a new platform,
most notably Green Day
and Blink-182. Indie
rock bands continued in
the underground scene
with legends including
Pixies, Sonic Youth and
Pavement.
The pop/post-punk
genre had taken main
stage at the end of the
90s and remained a titan
for the first half of the
00s. Most of us have
memories of screaming
along to ‘Sk8er Boi’, ‘All
the Small Things’ and
‘American Idiot’. Garage
and new wave revival
took hold at the same
time. The Killers, The
White Stripes and Interpol
dominated the scene with
legendary albums – Is
This It, White Blood Cells
and Turn On the Bright
Lights. Lateralus by Tool
is still championed as one
of the greatest heavy metal
records in history. In the
latter half of the decade
pop was crushing rock in
the charts. Independent
internet radio stations and
blogs helped indie rock
rise from the underground
and become the height of
rock with stars such as
Arcade Fire, MGMT, and
Vampire Weekend.
This decade indie
rock has become the
mainstream of rock
music, with a much softer
and refined sound than
decades earlier. However,
with streaming platforms
democratising the music
industry all sub-genres
are still surviving. Psy-
chedelic rock in particular
has taken off with Tame
Impala, Mac DeMarco,
King Gizzard & the Lizard
Wizard, and Homeshake.
Additionally, the longer
standing artists of years
gone by have been putting
out spectacular music
too, including Radiohead,
David Bowie (rip), AC/
DC and Nick Cave. A
resurgence in post-punk
led by bands like Idles and
Slaves has led to modern
punk, which may well be
the future of the genre.
No matter what, rock has
endured over seventy
decades and brought with
it a plethora of timeless
albums, fashions and
memories.
