Tepid Reviews for Dear Evan Hansen?
The Broadway awards juggernaut arrives in London to less than glowing reviews.... but is this justified?
I
t was rather sur-
prising to me that
the majority of the
professional reviews
for Dear Evan Hansen,
the Broadway juggernaut
that just made its way to
the West End stage, have
been rather tepid. Unlike
its Broadway counterpart,
which was showered
with endless praise and
a plethora of five star
reviews, it seems that in
London, most reviewers
have enjoyed the show,
just not enough to give it
the glowing 5 stars that
everyone was convinced
it would be getting.
Over the last month or
so, I was lucky enough to
see the show twice (thank
you, random stranger on
Twitter who gave me his
extra ticket). And I loved
every second of it.
With the music and
lyrics written by Benj
Pasek and Justin Paul
(the writers behind the
music of The Greatest
Showman), and book
by Steven Levenso,
Dear Evan Hansen tells
the story of an anxious
teenager, Evan, who finds
himself in a web of lies,
pretending to be best
friends with a classmate
who commited suicide.
One of the show’s main
strengths is the witty,
sharp songwriting which
takes the audience on a
rollercoaster of emotions.
The show isn’t overtly sad,
however there are some
undertones that touch on
very sensitive topics that
successfully manages to
get an emotional reaction
from the audience. None
of it is overly soppy
despite exploring heavy
themes with sufficient
depth.
It is also gorgeously
staged, reflecting images
of social media platforms
on the stage and on many
screens, driving home its
point regarding the impact
of technology on today’s
teenagers’ lives. The
choreography is also quite
gorgeous, with constant
callbacks to earlier bits of
the performance, perfectly
supplementing the lyrics.
My only complaint
about the show is that the
first half of the second
act kind of drags, mainly
because it contains some
of the weaker songs in the
musical, but this doesn’t
take away much from the
overall viewing experi-
ence. My least favourite
“The first half
of the second
act kind of
drags, mainly
because it
contains some
of the weaker
songs in the
musical”
“Sam Tutty,
fresh out
of drama
school, does a
commendable
job as Evan,
executing the
emotional
depth of the
character
perfectly”
song in the musical is
easily ‘To Break In a
Glove’. While I get why
song is placed where it
has been placed, and the
purpose it serves in the
story. The metaphor is
crystal clear (maybe a bit
too on the nose at times).
it’s just a bit of a dud
in comparison to what
comes before and after.
Despite falling in love
with the show head over
heels, I’d like to put my
own two cents in and
explore why the reception
has been rather lukewarm
on this side of the pond.
Without a seed of doubt
in my mind, I believe that
the main reason for the
rather lukewarm recep-
tion is rooted within the
sky-high expectations of
the show. Having opened
on Broadway in 2016, the
original cast recording
has been available on
every music streaming
service for 3 years now.
It is unlikely that those
who are well versed in
the world of musical
theatre haven’t heard at
least some of the show’s
music, given the amount
of positive publicity the
show has received over
time. Therefore, when the
show finally made its way
to London, it was… old
news?
Having mentioned the
original Broadway cast
recording, I would be
remiss if I did not talk
about the original London
cast. Sam Tutty, fresh out
of drama school, does
a commendable job as
Evan, executing the emo-
tional depth of the char-
acter perfectly. However,
vocally, he is no Ben Platt.
Don’t get me wrong, Tutty
is a great vocalist and
probably a more believ-
able high school student,
but whoever was cast as
Evan would have most
likely been a step down
from Platt, whose vocals
still blow me away every
time I listen to the original
cast recording. Platt’s
career was propelled to
new heights, releasing
an album and starring in
a Netflix original show,
which doesn’t come as a
surprise given how much
buzz there was around
Dear Evan Hansen in the
States, mainly surround-
ing Platt.
Some reviews pointed
out that the show’s sto-
ryline is too far-fetched,
which I wholeheartedly
disagree with. The show
does take some leaps here
and there, sure. However,
when Aladdin and
Jasmine flew on a magic
carpet, no one called it out
for being too far-fetched.
Suspension of disbelief is
an important part of the
theatregoing experience,
and Dear Evan Hansen
makes use of this in the
best way possible to touch
on so many important
problems plaguing today’s
youth, such as anxiety, de-
pression, suicide and the
role of technology in all
of this. Perhaps one of the
reasons why the same plot
was seen as far-fetched in
the UK while being called
groundbreaking in the
States may be the vastly
different high school ex-
periences between the two
countries. Who knows.
Overall, Dear Evan
Hansen is an excellent
show, touching on
many important issues
surrounding the youth in
this day and age. It is a
show that is written about
young people, for young
people. I would jump at
an opportunity to get to
watch the show again
(and again), but I do un-
derstand why middle aged
reviewers who’ve been
familiar with the material,
performed by a complete-
ly different cast, for years
would be slightly let down
by the final product on the
London stage.
