SCIENCE
1975
Richard (Dick) Selley is made Head
of Geology; a leading sedimentologist
who was part of the exploration team
that discovered the Lyell, Murchison
and Hutton oil fields. His later research
also encompassed geoviticulture, or
the sedimentology behind wine pro-
duction. He reportedly advised on the
creation of Denbies, an award-winning
vineyard in Surrey, reachable within an
hour’s train ride out of Waterloo station.
1970s-80s
Discussions of possible mergers with
other institutions are mooted, including
Royal Holloway and Westfield College.
A humanities arm is opened in 1980,
and in 1988, the college merges with
St Mary’s Hospital Medical School.
1980
Physicist David Potter, together
with ex-students, starts up PSION
- Potter’s Scientific Instruments
Or Nothing, which goes on to be-
come produce the Psion Organiser,
the first pocket computer, in 1984.
1986
Frederick John Perry, an aer-
odynamicist and Imperial
College alumnus, is part of a
team that capture the absolute
world speed helicopter re-
cord. At Westland Helicopters,
he also develops the BERP
(British Experimental Rotor
Programme) helicopter rotor.
1988
Professor Igor Aleksander
becomes the Chair of Neural
Systems Engineering in the Elec-
trical Engineering Department.
A leading thinker in computa-
tional consciousness, he also
co-designs the first neural pattern
recognition system.
1985-90
Dr. Amanda Fisher research-
es the molecular characteris-
tics of the HIV-1 virus, allow-
ing the immunosuppressive
activity of the virus to be
understood. Her research
forms the basis for follow-
ing antiretroviral treatments,
and she is currently Imperi-
al College’s Head of the In-
stitute of Clinical Sciences.
1991
The first medical robot, PRO-
BOT, is used to remove pros-
tatic tissue from a patient
in a clinical trial, developed
by Professor Brian Davies,
medical robotics specialist.
He goes on to found medi-
cal robotics company AC-
ROBOT, which specialises
in hip and knee replacement.
1999
Imperial alumnus Andreas Mo-
gensen graduates. He goes on
to train as an astronaut, and
in 2015, is the first Danish as-
tronaut to go into space as
part of the IRISS programme.
1996
Triumph! Imperial College wins their first
University Challenge. After losing out to
Jesus College, Oxford, in 1986, Imperial
College returns 10 years later to take the
title - and win it again in 2001.
1997
Following the merger with St
Mary’s Hospital Medical School
in 1988, Imperial College now
merges with the Royal Postgrad-
uate Medical School, and the
Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical School, forming the Im-
perial College School of Medicine.
2001-2002
Imperial College chemist, Professor
Tom Welton, and colleagues’ research
finds solvents that allow for the res-
toration of the Japanese lacquer used
on the Mazarin Chest, one of the best
examples of exported lacquer in the
world that formed part of the V&A mu-
seum’s Japanese collection. Removed
from display in 1999 to prevent fur-
ther degradation, Welton’s research
allows it to travel the world again.
2003
I m p e r i a l
Immunologist, Profes-
sor Charles Bangham,
discovers the virological
synapse - the mechanism
viruses such as HIV and
murine leukaemia use
to spread between cells.
2005
Professor Roger
Kneebone sets up the UK’s
only Masters in Education
course in Surgical Educa-
tion. This is the first course
to link up both the practical
and theoretical elements of
surgery with social scienc-
es, exploring the connec-
tions between the disciplines
in Biomedical Science.
2006
The Membrane Protein Laborato-
ry is launched, set up by Imperi-
al College’s Professor So Iwata,
with Oxford University’s Profes-
sor Dame Louise Johnson. Iwata
finds the first clear evidence that
proteins change shape to perform
their functions, and the laboratory
goes on to help determine the 3D
shape changes of many proteins
and drive research forward in areas
including pain and photosynthesis.
2007
Imperial College
turns 100!
2015
Libby Jackson, Imperial Physicist alumnus,
becomes Astronaut Flight Education Manager
at the UK Space Agency during Tim Peake’s
launch to the International Space Station. Pre-
viously a flight director at the ISS, she is able
to use her experience to run educational mis-
sions around space exploration and the launch.
2016
Imperial College opens the London DNA
Foundry with investment from the Gov-
ernment to drive forward synthetic biolo-
gy. Using a ‘design, build, test, and learn’
approach, the Foundry aims to provide ge-
netic solutions to modern-day problems.
2018
Imperial research team lead by Bill Rutherford
finds that photosynthesis happens ‘beyond the
red’ limit - plants can use ‘near IR’ in specif-
ic conditions when supplies of IR are low. The
finding shows that NIR photosynthesis is possi-
ble across many plants, and not just isolated spe-
cies of cyanobacteria, (as previously thought).
2019
Applying a multidisciplinary ap-
proach to antibiotic resistance, Im-
perial researchers and alumni find
that a small-molecule can inhibit the
DNA repair mechanism in bacteria
that is needed for introducing antibi-
otic resistance genes, thus reversing
MRSA resistance to ciprofloxacin.
