PEOPLE’S VOTE AND BREXIT
OVERALL:
73% REMAIN
20% LEAVE

Some of the variations
in voting intention
could be attributed to
wide variations in the
gender balances across
different faculties at
Imperial. However, when
comparing Engineering
and Sciences, both had
around 76%-79% male
respondants and yet the
Sciences still seemed
more liberal.
