MindtheGap:MoviestoLookOutforthisBreak
I
t’s cold, you’re bored,
and your friends from
home are looking
for something to
do. Look no further than
our list of new releases
to keep you entertained
while we’re away.
BLACK CHRISTMAS:
12th
December
A loose remake of
the 1974 fan favourite
Christmas movie. As the
nights grow colder and
darker, girls on a univer-
sity campus are killed by
an anonymous stalker.
Perfect for anyone looking
for their Christmas and
slasher fix all wrapped up
into one.
JUMANJI: THE NEXT
LEVEL: 13th
December
Smolder Bravestone
and the gang are back in
this sequel to save their
friend from the virtual
world of Jumanji. With
more deadly terrains and
even deadlier animals, the
challenge intensifies as
two pensioners are sucked
into the game too.
STAR WARS: THE RISE
OF SKYWALKER: 19th
December
Fourty-four years after
it all started, twenty years
after Jar Jar Binks, and
two years since swole
Kylo Ren, ‘the skywalker
saga’ gets its final instal-
ment this Christmas. Jedi
vs. Sith. Resistance vs.
First Order. I’d advise
seeing this before twitter
ruins it for you.
CATS: 20th
December
Tom Hooper directs his
next musical film after Les
Misérables to bring to life
Lloyd Webbers musical,
Cats. Sure to provide you
with mind-blowing cho-
reography and amazing
vocals that will hopefully
distract you from that oh-
so-awful CGI.
LITTLE WOMEN: 26th
December
A remake of the classic
novel with Saoirse Ronan,
Emma Watson, Timothee
Chalamet and Meryl
Streep. This family drama
follows the March sisters
as they grow up in the
aftermath of the American
Civil War.
1917: 10th
January
Directed by British
director Sam Mendes
(American Beauty).
Two young soldiers are
entrusted to deliver news
to over 1,600 soldiers
of a deadly attack. With
Oscar buzz surrounding
it already, something to
look out for in this movie
is how it appears to be one
continuous shot from start
to finish.
Festive Favourites
S
ince it is the
season, I thought
I would make a
list of my go-to
Christmas films for the
December period. They
aren’t going to be ground
breaking - I’m sure you
will have watched them
before - nor will they be
films I consider impres-
sive, however they give
me that warm festive
feeling and get me excited
for Christmas. So, if the
Imperial workload is sup-
pressing your Christmas
spirit, throw one of these
on and you’re bound to
feel a bit more merry.
LOVE ACTUALLY
Love it or hate it, with
Colin Firth, Hugh Grant,
Alan Rickman, Emma
Thompson, and many
more, you can’t deny it
has a killer cast. Even
though it’s not really a
Christmas film, but a ro-
mantic-comedy, it really
is a Christmas classic and
I doubt you’ll manage to
survive the season in the
UK without seeing it on
the telly at least once.
HOME ALONE 2: LOST
IN NEW YORK
I feel like not many
people agree with this,
but I definitely favour the
second instalment in the
Home Alone franchise
over the first (who even
cares about the rest?).
It has all the fun of the
first film, but is set in
New York City, and who
doesn’t dream of a Christ-
mas in New York?
HARRY POTTER
Of course Harry Potter
films aren’t in anyway
Christmassy, but I can’t
dissociate them from
Christmas. There are few
things more comforting
than staying in to watch
Harry Potter on a cold
winter’s day and I’m sure
we’ve all participated
in a Harry Potter TV
marathon around this time
of year.
HOW THE GRINCH
STOLE CHRISTMAS
This adaptation of the
classic story by Dr. Seuss
has been a firm Christmas
favourite of mine for as
long as I can remember.
Maybe its nostalgia, but
I love everything about
this, from Jim Carrey’s
interpretation of the
Grinch, the songs to the
Who’s little upturned
noses. Personally I don’t
think you can be too old to
enjoy this.
IT’S AWONDERFUL LIFE
It’s a Wonderful Life
is just a brilliant film in
itself, but with the added
festivities, it becomes one
of my favourites. Growing
up, my siblings and I had
this film forced upon us
by our parents annually. I
may have found it slightly
frustrating then, but now I
find this story about a man
on the edge of a suicide
attempt being shown the
importance of his life by
an angel so touching.
