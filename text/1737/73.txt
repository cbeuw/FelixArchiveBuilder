is because there is an
environmental cost for
everything. The fact
that every resource is
limited on this planet,
coupled with the rising
level of demand for these
resources, tragedy of the
commons is the outcome.
These issues are large-
scale and require laws,
policies, and international
cooperation.
However, governments
are not doing their part,
focusing instead on profit
over protecting the planet.
For example, the far-
right president of Brazil,
Bolsonaro encouraged
the exploitation of the
Amazon. As part of his
campaign, he promised to
fundamentally subvert the
country’s long-standing
commitment to protect the
Amazon. He encouraged
and fuelled the Amazon
fires, threatened indige-
nous communities, and is
currently trying to shift
the blame of the Amazon
fires onto NGOs and
Leonardo Di Caprio (how
dare he?). The tyranny
of Bolsonaro has been
particularly prominent
recently, with the arrests
of volunteer firefighters
and others who are trying
to protect the Amazon.
Current regulations for
the forementioned issues
do not come close to
opposing the threats they
pose to our planet. Indeed,
there are laws and regula-
tions for fishing, but they
are badly implemented,
and the UK government
has not done as much
work as NGOs such as
Greenpeace to investigate
the practices of the fishing
industry. Currently,
there is a fishing quota,
but young cods are still
being illegally discarded
on an industrial scale
(to make space for other
more profitable catches),
with the result of legal
catches in UK seas likely
to have been exceeded
by one-third. The gov-
ernment also claims that
36% of England’s waters
are “safeguarded as
marine protected areas”.
However, a recent paper
in the Science journal
found that the trawling
intensity in European
protected areas is actually
higher than in unprotected
places. Thus, the claims
of the government are to
deceive the public into
believing that something
is being done, while in
reality, (surprise, surprise)
they do nothing.
Another interesting
thing to note is that those
industries actually benefit
very few people, and is not
providing as much for the
average person. Green-
peace discovered that
29% of the UK’s fishing
quota is owned by only
five families, all of whom
feature on the Sunday
Times Rich List. The
meat industry is also quite
monopolised, with almost
all meat coming from 4
companies in the US; it is
likely that the companies
not only exploit animals,
but also their workers, and
the money ends up going
to the people at the top.
As members of society,
we can refrain from
buying products that are
contributing towards
resource depletion and
global pollution. This
includes beef (and other
animal products) which
is the main cause of de-
forestation. British beef,
which often uses soy feed
imported from Brazil has
huge amounts of carbon
emissions. We can also
choose to stop eating fish
to stop contributing to the
demand for an industry
that is killing our oceans.
There are alternatives
to eating beef and fish:
many fish and chips shops
in London have actually
converted to being fully
plant-based and as for
beef, there have been
businesses such as Im-
possible Foods Inc and
Beyond Meat that provide
alternatives. These com-
panies have generated
immense interest, with
Beyond Meat having the
world’s biggest IPO pop
since 2000. Consumer
choices really matter, as
one person’s actions often
influence those around
them, a snowball effect
occurs. As new ethical
consumer trends are
“Current
regulations
for the
mentioned
issues are not
proportionate
to the threats
to our planet”
“Many of
those issues
need to be
targeted on an
international
scale ”
created, unethical compa-
nies become less competi-
tive on the market.
There is also an urgent
need for governments to
act, as this issue needs
to be targeted on an in-
ternational scale in many
cases. We need to spread
awareness of the issues of
tragedy of the commons,
as governments are more
than happy to ignore
them, since GDP and
profit is all they care
about. We need to sign pe-
titions (currently paused
for general elections, but
do sign them later), join
protests, and have our
demands heard. Without
regulation, businesses and
producers will always act
in their own self-interests,
and their selfish decisions
will lead to horrific envi-
ronmental consequences
that harm everyone else.
For the government, there
are two main ways of
combatting the problem:
they can either assign
ownership and enforce
that so the producers
take into account the
long-term sustainability
of their businesses, or the
government can enforce
regulations, quotas and
laws better. It is atrocious
that governments are cur-
rently doing nothing. Pro-
tecting common access
resources and preventing
tragedy of the commons
is an important initiative,
and governments must act
now.
It is not impossible to
“The ozone
has started
to recover,
because
there were
international
agreements,
laws and
regulations
combatting
this issue”
correct the problem of
common access resourc-
es. In the past, when the
ozone layer was depleted
due to the use of CFCs
as refrigerants, interna-
tional agreements, laws
and regulations were put
into place to combat this
problem,andtheozonehas
started to recover. Right
now, there is an urgent

need for governments to
do the same thing with all
the issues mentioned in
this article. We are on the
brink of mass extinctions,
and we are at a point of no
return. As citizens, we can
all play our part in pres-
suring the government
and reducing demand for
unethical industries. If we
all work together, maybe
we can stop catastrophic
tragedy of the commons
before it is too late.
