Best of the decade: Editor’s choice
Television editor Jia ranks ten of her favourite TV shows of the decade
C
hoosing and
ranking the best
TV shows of the
decade might
have been the most daunt-
ing task especially in the
era of “Peak TV” where
every provider churns out
quality pieces at an un-
precedented rate. But I’ve
managed to narrow the
list down to ten. I’m sure
I have missed many gems,
and this list is not the most
objective (I do have a soft
spot for comedies), but
here we go:
1. Fleabag (2016 -
2019)
Fleabag as previously
mentioned is undoubtedly
my favourite show of
all time. What Phoebe
Waller-Bridge has created
can only be described
as a masterpiece - every
second of it delivers some-
thing unexpected. The
way it breaks the fourth
wall is a necessary touch
but also incorporates the
sort of ambiguity that I
thought was exclusive to
literature - each sentence
carries a different weight.
You get to delve deep into
the character’s mind while
the narrative continues.
If there’s a textbook on
the history of television
shows, I firmly believe
that Fleabag deserves its
own section.
2. Breaking Bad (2008
- 2013)
I went in for the
premise of high-school-
chemistry-teacher-turned-
drug-dealer (honestly who
wouldn’t?), and little did I
know what I was in a ride
for. I can’t even pinpoint
the best part of the show
because every aspect is
simply perfect. Very few
shows have managed
to achieve this level of
character development
to the point that the first
and last seasons feel like
they belong to two com-
pletely different shows,
yet the plot moves so
naturally and builds such
a convincing backstory.
Every episode leaves you
pondering where it will go
next. It also takes brilliant
acting to bring life to the
complex characters. In
short, AMC’s Breaking
Bad lives up to its hype
as “one of the greatest TV
shows of all time.”
3. The World Between
Us (2019)
I hesitated for a
moment whether to
include HBO Asia’s The
World Between Us in
this list - but I figured I
had to for its impact on
the Asian TV scene. It is
a Taiwanese series that
explores the aftermath of
a mass shooting, skillfully
intertwining perspectives
of all parties involved. It
holds a special spot in my
heart - my buckets of tears
are all the evidence you
need. The characters are
exquisitely crafted; the
dialogues are written and
delivered with such emo-
tional precision. I want to
applaud the show creators
for their brutally honest
take on the uneasy topics
of morality, mass-killing,
human rights, and mental
health. It’s certainly the
Taiwanese show of the
decade.
4. Sherlock (2010 -
2017)
BBC’s Sherlock is the
modern take on Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle’s Sherlock
Holmes detective stories,
and it’s the perfect balance
between old and new. It’s
a rather difficult task to put
a twist on a well-known
classic, but Steven Moffat
and Mark Gatiss execute it
flawlessly, staying faithful
to its source material
while adding a refresh-
ing and inventive flare.
Benedict Cumberbatch’s
and Martin Freeman’s
superb acting bring life to
the classic duo. Although
the last season falls short
of my expectations, I still
regard it as one of my
favourites of the decade
for its witty lines and
impeccable chemistry.
5. Westworld (2016 -
Present)
Diving into Westworld
I was initially uncertain
about the cliche AI
uprising trope, but thank-
fully it did not disappoint
- setting it in a western
theme park is kind of a
genius move. The high-
light for me is definitely
the visual stimulation - be
it the meticulous special
effects or the set design.
Undeniably Westworld is
multilayered and fascinat-
ingly explored, brought
out by its critically ac-
claimed cast. For all the
violence and misogyny,
Westworld still remains
within the acceptable
boundaries and neverthe-
less presents an interest-
ing case of humans losing
humanity and androids
gaining it.
6. The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel (2017 -
Present)
This period-drama
comedy is set in 1950’s
Manhattan centered
around Miriam “Midge”
Maisel (played by
Rachel Brosnahan),
an upper-class Jewish
American housewife
who’s pursuing a career
in stand up comedy after
her husband has an affair
and leaves her. It’s simple,
delightful, energetic and
has an upbeat optimism
that puts a smile on my
space any day. There’s a
cheerful elegance to the
fifties tied in with the uni-
versal theme of a woman
finding her own voice that
makes the show work.
7. Modern Family
(2009 - Present)
Modern Family is a
mockumentary capturing
the trials and tribulations
of the Pritchett families,
three very different yet
interconnected families.
Although I have to admit
that there is a decline in
the later seasons, it’s still
neurotic, hilarious, and
heartfelt. It’s also very
reflective of a typical
American family and is
decade-characteristic,
which was why I related
the show in the first
place when I moved to
the States. It’s the sort of
“pick-me-up” or “feel-
good” show that’s a staple
on everyone’s rewatch
list.
8. The Big Bang Theo-
ry (2007 - 2019)
The twelve-year run
The Big Bang Theory tells
the story of two CalTech
physicists and their new
neighbor next door. While
many cite an inconsist-
ency in the quality of
each season, it finished
with a strong ending
that beautifully wraps
up the twelve seasons.
The geeky dynamics and
nerdy references were
nicely played out (except
when the writers fell into
the trap of stereotyping).
Nonetheless, this show
has accompanied me
through many stages of
life and can be framed as
a decade-defining sitcom.
9. Killing Eve (2018 -
Present)
Here we have yet
another gem from Phoebe
Waller-Bridge. Killing
Eve is a thrilling cat-and-
mouse tale between MI6
operative Eve Polastri
(played by Sandra Oh)
and psychopathic assassin
Villanelle (played by Jodie
Comer). There’s unbeliev-
able chemistry between
the pair that defines the
show. Every aspect - plot,
character development,
set design, costume
design, cinematography
- is simply excellent.
Unquestionably Waller-
Bridge has mastered the
art of storytelling.
10. Chernobyl (2019)
HBO’s Chernobyl is
a five-part miniseries
based on the catastroph-
ic 1986 nuclear accident
in Chernobyl. It’s grip-
ping, disheartening, pain-
fully honest, and can be
best summarised with the
question “What is the cost
of lies?” Its focus on hu-
mans is what sets it apart
from other documenta-
ries and what makes it all
the more horrifying and
blunt. It’s era-defining,
paradigm-shifting, and
well-deserved of its nine-
teen Emmy nominations.
It’s a story that needed to
be told, and I’m glad HBO
found the right people to
tell the story.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is transcendent both as a writer and an actress in Fleabag // Amazon Prime
