Amelie: A warm hug in this cruel world
Despite being a Broadway flop, Amelie charms and stuns on the London stage by re-igniting some of the Parisian
charm from the original movie
A
dapted from the
five-time Oscar
n o m i n a t e d
French lan-
guage movie of the same
name, Amelie tells the
story of a girl with a wild
imagination who takes
pleasure in performing
“small, but extraordinary
acts of kindness” with
the goal of bringing joy
to those around her. What
must she do to bring her-
self the happiness that she
so effortlessly provides
those around her?
Charming is the only
word I can think of that
sufficiently describes
Amelie. The relatively
small stage and audi-
torium of The Other
Palace greatly contribute
to the cosy feel of the
production, which makes
it perfect for a date. The
couple sitting in front
of me would probably
agree, as they partook in
an endless round of tonsil
tennis throughout.
The only downside of
the small stage size is that,
at times, it felt overcrowd-
ed, especially due to the
actor/muso approach - the
cast members themselves
were the ones playing
the instruments on stage.
However, this was rarely
an issue, and I strongly
believe that the small
stage size helped give the
production an intimate
feel more than it hurt it.
There were some relative-
ly odd choices sprinkled
throughout the show,
such as using the death of
Princess Diana as a time-
frame reference, and as
justification for Amelie’s
actions. However, the
oddest moment of the
production was a dream
sequence involving ‘Elton
John’ serenading the lead
character, complete with
weird pop culture refer-
ences (such as Oprah’s
famous ‘you get a car’
speech). I guess this all
worked well to illustrate
the colourful imagination
of Amelie and draw the
“This is
no direct
import from
Broadway,
but a re-
imagination
of the source
material and
a complete
return to form”
audience in..
Although the show was
globally outstanding, the
final twenty minutes were
completely breathtaking,
and without a doubt some
of the most romantic
moments I’ve ever wit-
nessed on stage.
I am half ashamed to
admit that I have yet to
see the movie, although
I have been in love with
its score for many years. I
was hoping that the show
would have borrowed
some elements from the
iconic score by Yann
Tiersen, which brilliantly
captures the charm and
the melancholy of the
character. This unfortu-
nately wasn’t the case.
However, the music was
strong enough to stand on
its own two feet, having a
distinct Parisian feel.
The overall cast was
exceptional, with Audrey
Brisson providing an
unbelievable vocal and
theatrical performance
as the titular character.
Her voice had a magical,
unique quality that feels
as true to the character
as one could imagine or
hope for. Likewise, Chris
Jared proved to be an
excellent choice for Nino,
the mystical yet endearing
potential love interest for
Amelie.
Having opened on
Broadway in 2017,
closing a mere two
months later despite the
undeniable star power for
Philippa Soo (her first role
since leaving the cast of
Hamilton), I was curious
to find out two things: why
the Broadway production
ended so prematurely,
and why such a failure
would be brought to the
London stage. Being the
investigative journalist
that I am, I quickly found
out that the main issue
with the Broadway pro-
duction was the complete
loss of its original charm
and Parisian feel. This is
abundantly clear from the
Original Cast Recording
as well, which sounds
like... well... every other
show on Broadway...
I am extremely happy
to report that this issue has
been completely resolved
for the UK production as
this is no direct import
from Broadway, but a
re-imagination of the
source material, and a
complete return to form.
This is a completely new
show, complete with a
new director, new staging
and new musical arrange-
ments (complete with
accordions), which brings
back the Parisian feel to
the show that it desper-
ately seems to have been
missing in New York.
Charming. That’s
all I can say about this
gorgeous production that
ultimately has its strength
in its cosy feel. Don’t let
the initial bad press sur-
rounding the Broadway
production scare you. See
this show.
