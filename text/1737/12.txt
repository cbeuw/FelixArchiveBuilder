GENERAL
ELECTION
POLL
Felixʼs 2019 220 PARTICIPANTS
With a general election in full swing, Felix has been
polling students at Imperial College to gain some
insight into their voting intentions and opinions on a
People’s Vote (a second referendum Brexit).
This anonymous survey, which was open to all
irrespective of voting eligibility, also asked for gender,
age and faculty.This data was then used to determine
whether certain stereotypes applied to Imperial, how
voting preference differed across faculty, how Brexit
cuts across party alliance.
23% FEMALE; 77% MALE
MEAN AGE OF 20.9
41.1% SCIENTISTS
46.9% ENGINEERS
12.0% MEDICS

This chart represents each respondent to our
survey as a seat in a mock parliament.
We then scaled the latest national student
poll from Dec 2 (published by ICM) onto
a second mock parliament with the same
number of seats.
We even did a Chi-squared test to see if the
Red&Blue are statistically different - and yes,
yes they are (x-value: 9.29; p-value: 0.0023)

The international student body weighs in Lots of students at our university can’t vote but we still included them
in our survey. To show the geographical variation in voting intention
we represented each region surveyed as a constituency showing which
party would win and which would be runner up, with focus on countries
in the United Kingdom.
