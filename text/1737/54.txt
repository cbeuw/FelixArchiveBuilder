A brief history of jazz

B
y the time this
n e w s p a p e r
came into ex-
istence, jazz
was already old – or at
least middle aged. Louis
Armstrong had defined
improvisation, swing
had already been and
gone, replaced by fran-
tic bebop, cool jazz and
eventually fusion. Gen-
res like rock and soul
had begun to rear their
heads, offshoots of jazz
blended with blues. The
fact that jazz is a force to
be reckoned with years
later, is a unique feat.
To newly emancipated
black Americans, music
represented a chance to
escape poverty, as an em-
ployment unaffected by
segregation. This created
an armada of black mu-
sicians that would shape
the music of the 20th
century, and an attitude
to music that can still be
seen in impoverished US
communities.
It is unsurprising then,
that African drumming,
blues and work songs of
ex-slaves formed the cor-
nerstones of what would
later be labelled “Amer-
ica’s classical music”.
Born in New Orleans, and
fittingly played on instru-
ments left over from civil
war marching bands, jazz
passed through the typical
cycle of public outrage
and eventual acceptance
while incubating in pro-
hibition era speakeasies.
By the time the 30s rolled
around, swing jazz was in
full … swing.
Ahighlydanceable(and
therefore popular) style,
swing was built around big
bands, the most famous of
which was led by Duke
Ellington; these groups
were characterised by
their juggernautian sound
and uneven, swaggering
rhythms. Solos were a key
component of the style,
with soloists building on
the foundations laid by
Louis Armstrong, deliv-
ering intricate rhythms
and interpolations of well-
known melodies in feats
of sheer virtuosity.
At the outbreak of
WWII, big bands became
difficult to sustain, as mu-
sicians were conscripted
in droves. Smaller bands
became more common,
pioneered by innovators
like Charlie Parker, The-
lonious Monk and Dizzy
Gillespie, these groups
adopted increasingly com-
plex harmonies, featuring
dissonance, modulations
and passing chords.
The music was signif-
icantly faster, drumming
focused primarily on the
ride cymbal, punctuated
with off-beat snare hits
and vigorous walking
basslines. This was the
birth of bebop, a style to
be listened to, not danced
to.
Whilst critically suc-
cessful, and hugely influ-
ential, bebop lacked the
public appeal of swing,
and so gradually seceded
to encroachments from of
a variety of other styles.
Enter Miles Davis,
whose string of singles
that became Birth of the
Cool were a blueprint for
a more laid-back, sweet
style of jazz, which bal-
anced harmonic intrigue
with listenability – literal-
ly giving the word ‘cool’
its meaning. Developed
by the likes of Stan Getz,
Dave Brubeck and Paul
Desmond, it wasn’t until
1959 that this relaxed
style would take its next
“I’ve changed
the course
of music five
times. What
have you done
except fuck the
president?”-
Miles Davis to
Nancy Raegan
step forward. Davis’ Kind
of Blue, recorded in only
2 sessions, is widely con-
sidered as the greatest jazz
album of all time, here
Miles revolutionised the
genre for a second time.
‘Modal jazz’ focuses its
improvisations on a spe-
cific scale or mode, rather
than fitting each chord
individually. This helps
build long, rich melody
lines, modals jazz also
features sour chords and
harmon muted trumpet,
with its distinctly whis-
pered and seductive tone.
Artists like Grant Green,
Wayne Shorter and Bill
Evans, whose ambiguous
chords created a sedate
style of his own would
perfect cool and modal
jazz into the 60s.
Meanwhile influences
from classical, distilled
through the music of
Duke Ellington’s one-
of-a-kind big band in the
30s, was informing many
artists, most notably band
leader and bassist Charles
Mingus, whose raucus,
and frankly terrifying
harmonies found success
on records like Mingus
Ah Um. John Coltrane,
after building his name
on Davis influenced work,
would push the boat out
which Davis replied:
“I’ve changed the
course of music five or
six times. What have
you done except fuck the
president?”
It was with exactly this
spirit that Miles Davis
set out blending funk
and rock into jazz, on his
seminal records In a Silent
Way and Bitches Brew.
These records sparked a
jazz fusion renaissance,
with a fascinating range
of sounds, yielding classic
records like The Weather
Report, Head Hunters and
Red Clay. Other artists
would incorporate these
influences, as well as
pop into their improvisa-
tional styles, over softer
backdrops. This resulted
in a growing number of
accessible, commercially
successful records that
would earn artists like
George Benson the label
‘sellout’, and an awful lot
of money.
Whilst notable artists:
Wynton Marsalis, Roy
Hargrove, Vijay Iyer were
active throughout later
decades and acid jazz,
smooth jazz and hip-hop,
a genre which heavily
sampled jazz were all
around during the inter-
mittent decades, there is
notably less to be said for
the late 70s through 00s.
Recently however,
artists like Thundercat,
Christian Scott and
Kamasi Washington
have sprung up, taking
cues from the changed
musical landscape, to
deliver electronic-tinged,
rhythm-driven jazz,
finding a market of their
own. London is notable
for its thriving, jazz scene,
with artists like Jacob
Collier, Ezra Collective
and Alfa Mist rising from
a sea of promising faces.
Fresh and exciting music,
with a distinctly British,
sensibility is still flowing
in abundance, readers
are advised to take note.
These acts take cues from
afrobeat legends like Fela
Kuti and hip-hop, focus-
ing more heavily upon
rhyhtm, than the radical
harmonies of artists like
Chet Baker, in the last
year alone a vertiable
feast of music have been
released. But that is an
article for another day.

further, joining the like
of Ornette Coleman and
Don Cherry to create
works of Free jazz, that
defined much of the later
60s. These records are
often interesting, but defy
listeners to return to them,
proving largely too chaot-
ic to enjoy.
