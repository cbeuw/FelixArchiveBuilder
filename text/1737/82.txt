S
tudents across
Imperial are in
shock this week
at the lack of an
apocalypse following
such a turbulent decade.
As the 2010s draw to
a shaky close, Imperial
College students are
expressing surprise at the
apparent failure of the
decade to conclude with
a satisfying ending, that
being the extinction of
civilised society and the
demise of the human race.
Zhisabelle Ing, an inver-
tebrate specialist, told
Felix, “I’ve been waiting
for the end of the world
since 2012, when it was
promised by the Mayans.
Since then, I was told that
if Trump was elected,
we’d go down in a nuclear
fireball courtesy of North
Korea, and that Brexit
would reduce the UK
to a pile of ashes. Now
we’ve got Greta Thunberg
constantly on the micro-
phone, telling us that the
climate catastrophe is just
around the corner. I just
want to know when I’ll be
granted the sweet release
of not having to listen
to prophesies that never
come true. Just for once, I
want to be a Make-a-Wish
Foundation kid.”
Other students have
been complaining about
having to go home to
their politically polarised
houses. Mechanical En-
gineering student, Fomas
Thisher, claimed, “If
there was an apocalypse,
I wouldn’t have to see my
grandparents at Christ-
mas. Following the man-
dated generational split
according to polling data,
they’re aligning to polit-
ical positions that fuck
younger people out of
homes, jobs, and a future
on this cursed planet.
Naturally, to share that
spirit, I’ve bought them
tickets to an all-expenses
paid resort in Switzerland
for Christmas. One-way
of course.” Negafelix
understands that the
grandparents in question
have bought Fomas a life-
times supply of condoms.
Upon shaking, no noise
was heard.
A further interviewee
told Negafelix, “I mean
what do you expect from
a decade that was the
bastard child of an eco-
nomic crisis and political
mismanagement and ex-
ploitation? I’m mega dis-
appointed that the ending
was so anticlimactic.
Personally, I’m excited
for the 2020’s. I’ve learnt
the Mandarin for ‘I sur-
render’ and ‘Glory to Xi
Jinping!’I think I’m pretty
prepared.”
One 3rd year Comput-
ing student told Negafelix,
Suprising lack of apocalypse, almost suspiciously suprising // Geograph
in confidence, that stu-
dents should not yet give
up hope. “After multiple
conversations with the
Mormons across the road,
I’m more convinced than
ever that this the time of
the rapture will coincide
with the end of the decade.
All I need to do is become
polygamous in between
now and the 31st of De-
cember.” Negafelix wit-
nessed the same student
complaining about how
women wouldn’t date
him, even after he prom-
ised that they could be his
first wife.
“Surprise at
the apparent
failure of the
decade to
conclude with
a satisfying
ending”
