A
recent poll has
given Boris
J o h n s o n ’ s
Conservatives
a 20-point lead over
Labour in the run up
to Thursday’s election,
and this has prompted
analysts to raise con-
cerns over what such a
victory could mean for
the growing population
of British street urchins.
This group has been
a forgotten part of the
electorate for decades,
with the majority sub-
sisting on an annual sal-
ary of just tuppence and
“whatever the good Mr.
Pumperwinkle has to
spare”. Some observers
had initially speculated
that this economic real-
ity would drive urchins
to vote for Labour in
droves, but this has yet
to materialise, partly
because robust child
worker laws would ren-
der the majority of the
contingent unemployed.
Conservative policies
which are thought to be
most damaging include
the removal of subsidies
for workers in the chimney
cleaning industry, an
increased police presence
in Whitechapel, and a
blanket ban on unlicensed
shoe-shining. A spokes-
person for the group was
approached for comment,
but before Felix’s reporter
could ask anything, he
was robbed to the tune
of what sounded like
Chim-Chimney. One of
the biggest issues that
Dickensian urchins face
is adapting to changes in
the labour market. After
the recent closure of Fiz-
zlenack’s Opera Hat Co.
many former employees
were turned away from
new jobs, with many sur-
prised to learn that being
“sharp as a thistle, clean
as a whistle” was not suf-
ficient as a transferrable
skill. Workplace etiquette
is also sometimes lost on
urchins, with potential
bosses saying they felt
“uncomfortable” with
being referred to as a
“guvnor”.
For many, the woes of
the street urchins are not a
cause for concern. Among
these are stockbrokers,
who celebrated the FLI
(Flat Cap Index) being up
96 points at market close
the day the poll results
were released. Butchers
are also optimistic, with
record forecasts for turkey
sales reported, but only
for those that are “the
biggest in the shop, there
in the window”. Initially,
business leaders were
reluctant to come to the
defence of the urchins, but
they have since been led
in this cause by Amazon
CEO Jeff Bezos. This rep-
resents a U-turn in opinion
for the initially anti-urchin
Mr. Bezos, who unrelat-
edly was visited by three
ghostly apparitions the
night before the poll was
announced.
