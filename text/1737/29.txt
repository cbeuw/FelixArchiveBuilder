Hunger-thebattlebetween

L
ast year, I was
lucky enough to
watch War Horse
at the National
Theatre, its return to the
original National Theatre
venue a celebration of the
centenary of Armistice
Day.I loved it so much the
first time that I grabbed a
different friend the next
evening and ended up
queueing for return tickets
to watch it again.
Just about a year
later, the play returned
to London once again,
this time playing at the
Wembley Troubadour
Theatre before embarking
on a year-long internation-
al tour, heading to France,
Australia and Singapore.
Obviously, I had to go
watch War Horse once
again. Having convinced
a rather hesitant pair of
friends to tag along, we
made our way to Wembley
and left feeling that not
only was the commute
fully worth it, but that
we’d be more than happy
to travel further to witness
the marvel of War Horse.
In fact, as I’m writing
this, one of my friends is
already making plans to
return before the show
closes.
The story, adapted from
Michael Morpurgo’s best-
by a group of incredibly
talented puppeteers, are
so well-executed that
the first time I saw the
play, I started sobbing
the moment the horses
showed up.
War Horse has
everything that makes a
play great. It is innova-
tive, thought provoking,
relevantandjustallaround
excellent.Audiences of all
ages can find something
to take away from it about
humanity and the impor-
tance of love and compas-
sion towards humans and
animals alike. One just
has to be heartless for the
play to not strike a chord.
My feelings towards
War Horse have not
changed within the last
year, despite the change
in location and the cast.
When people hear how
frequently I go to the
theatre, their first question
is almost always ‘What’s
your favourite play of all
time?’. Not only is the
answer clear, but even
more so than before now
that I’ve had the chance
to relive the marvel that is
War Horse.
S
imply titled
“Hunger”, direc-
tor Fay Lomas
delves into the
psychological turmoil
as this primal instinct
comes face-to-face with
ambition. What sacrifices
are we willing to make
for our dreams? Although
the production is based on
the 1890 novel written by
modernist Knut Hamsun,
it displays a shocking
relevance to the present.
What unfolds in this
intimate studio is a story
that cuts at the heart and
mind of an aspiring writer
in his struggle to succeed.
It becomes clear that
this nameless writer is
not limited by his talent,
rather by the resounding
rejection from the bustling
metropolis. One by one,
his friendships, career,
and grasp of reality begin
to crumble as Hunger
takes over.
The writer’s desire to
flourish is a craving to
which we can all relate.
When we hear accounts
of the painful climb to
success, it can easily go
over our heads as those
experiences are often
brief and irrefutably
one-in-a-million. As the
story enters its second
half, the city itself grows
a character: an unforgiv-
ing, hungry predator that
begins to swallow the
failing writer whole.
Kwami Odoom as the
protagonist shines with
an earnest energy. He
portrays a driven albeit
naïve individual at the
cusp of his dreams, whose
sense of self gradually
unravels. As we watch
this happen, we realise the
extent of which we depend
on our career for purpose.
For the most part, the per-
formance is mesmerising.
However, the downwards
spiral to insanity is highly
abstract. Portraying this
in theatre is bold, and
there are moments which
simply do not work and
sometimes detach you
from the scene.
Without prior knowl-
edge to the original text,
the ending can come
across as abrupt and unex-
pected. But the rest of the
performance is so well re-
hearsed and precise that it
is as much a choreography
as it is a play. It is a real
pleasure to watch each
step of the four actors as
deliberate as the last.
This production is a
ruthless, finely tuned tale
of the harsh reality of
pursuing a pipe dream.
Small productions such as
these have the freedom to
stay faithful to the source
text, and it is shameful
how much it still rings
true. Knut Hamsun in
this modern age would be
disgraced for his perverse
views on race and politics.
Despite this, “Hunger”
remains powerfully
relevant and thought-pro-
voking, and an especially
important tale for any
aspiring student.

However, it is the staging
which elevates the narra-

heights. According to the
internet, when Morpurgo
was approached with the
idea of turning the book
into a play, he initially
thought it was an insane
idea. However, the re-
sulting product is a stroke
of genius. The horses,
