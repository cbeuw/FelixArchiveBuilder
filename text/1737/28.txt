Sun, Sex and Suspicous Parents: 1920s Edition
I
n a few weeks’ time
we will be in a new
decade, the 2020s. If
it’s anything like the
1920s, it should be a blast!
The Boy Friend gives a
little glimpse into what
life back then was like..
for young, pretty social-
ites at a finishing school
on the French Riviera that
is!
If you fit this descrip-
tion then the musical
really does create a
perfect period atmosphere
transporting you back a
century. The set is simple,
with a few chairs and
tables on a patio framed
by a delicate, lace-like
frame. As this is the 20s,
a white grand piano is the
centerpiece of the scenes.
Polly Browne (Amara
Okereke), whose love
story with secret Oxford
dropout Tony (Dylan
Mason) is the main plot of
the show, has a beautiful
voice which sounds like
it comes straight from
an old classic. At times
she sounds just like the
young lady who had her
Broadway debut playing
this exact part in 1954
- you may have heard of
her: Julie Andrews.
Maisie (Gabrielle
Lewis-Dodson), Dulcie
(Annie Southall) and
Fay (Emily Langham)
play Polly’s three school
friends. For all intents
and purposes they are
one single character, who
share a single brain by the
sounds of things. Wearing
simple 20s dresses that
look perfect for a tea
party, they moved as one
in a dramatic and giggly
way. At times it was like
watching an old cartoon
with piercingly prim and
proper accents.
The frightfully funny
and fearlessly french
Hortense (Tiffany Graves)
stole the show for me.
She plays the maid at the
finishing school but is
much more of a cool-aunt
figure for the english
roses studying there.
As everyone from the
comedic timing was im-
peccable and her radiant
stage-presence meant you
were always drawn to her
even when the stage got
busy.
Although the show
has some moments of
hilarity, drama and joy,
the audience is left a bit
confused at what exactly
is being presented. As the
dramatic storylines get
resolved in the third act, it
is unclear if the audience
was meant to take them
seriously all along or
if the funny situational
comedy was the substance
of the show. The first
half introduced a fun 20s
setting and the second
half introduced the comic
characters. However, the
third act seemed to pale in
comparison as the big ball
that everyone had been
building towards was
executed in a lacklustre
way. The costumes, which
up to this point were
immaculate, were a bit
disappointing here. They
looked cheap: a sort of
butterfly polyester dress
and a rushed Aladdin
costume needed huge
improvement. The show
had done such a good job
keeping true to its 20s
roots but this is one place
where it missed the mark.
Despite the problems in
the third part, the show is
still a real blast and will
have you (attempting)
the Charleston all the
way home. Although the
choreography is at times
quite complex, whether
they’re dancing a waltz,
tap, or even a tango, the
performers seemed to be
having lots of fun and it
is infectious. If you want
an intimate musical which
will whisk you away to
the sunny seaside on a
cold London night, this is
definitely for you!

young socialites to the
older elites seemed to be
caught up in silly little
love stories, Hortense,
like the audience, saw
the absurdness in these
rich people problems. Her
