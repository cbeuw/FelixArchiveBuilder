2019 in Review: The Best Films I’ve Seen this Year
I
t was not a difficult
task to name my
favourite films I
watched this year –
the ones listed below were
truly memorable and en-
tertaining. So here is my
selection, a bit eclectic I
would say, and since there
is no way to rank these
gems, I present them in
alphabetical order – enjoy.
BROKEN FLOWERS
(2005)
It starts like this: Don’s
orderly but monotonous
life is shaken up when he
gets dumped by his fiancé
and then finds out he has a
son. We follow him across
the US as he tracks down
his ex-lovers, trying to
figure out which one is the
mother of his child. It’s
quite melancholic, seeing
how the main character
develops with every en-
counter with an old flame,
reminded of the fact that
as time passes, people
change and most relation-
ships turn out to be futile
and temporary. The film is
also gripping as it engages
you in Don’s search for
clues. On the whole it’s
just brilliantly written,
with great attention to
detail, like little quirks
and habits that make each
character unique and
believable. It doesn’t give
out too much information,
however, leaving some
things unsaid, which I
think is Broken Flowers’
greatest strength.
DANGEROUS LIAISONS
(1988)
The biggest surprise
of the year for me. Cer-
tainly not a fan of period
dramas, I found this film
unbelievably absorbing,
coating and the desire to
manipulate and shatter
some hearts that makes
Dangerous Liaisons
actually a very dark film.
GHOST WORLD (2001)
I have done it countless
times: added a film to my
watchlist after seeing a
still on Instagram or else-
where, interested solely in
the visual side of it. That
was the case with Ghost
World, which initially
intrigued me with its le-
thargic suburban vibe, but
turned out to be so much
more. Based on a comic
book that I’ve yet to read,
this is a story of two high
school graduates, bored
and cynical, roaming
around in their sleepy
neighbourhood. Although
the film feels subtle and
muted, it does call up
strong feelings, since Enid
and Rebecca’s fear of
conformity and desperate
attempts to be original are
hilarious and painfully
sad at the same time. It’s
remarkable how well this
film sums up the mood
and doubts you have as
you step into adulthood.
male prostitutes on the
streets of Seattle. The
main character, Mike,
beautifully played by
River Phoenix, lives a life
disturbed by narcoleptic
episodes. He just evokes
so much sympathy that
you spend the two hours
aching and hoping with
him, while he tries to
find his long lost mother.
Nonetheless, it’s amazing
that a film touching on
loss, vulnerability and
search for acceptance
remains humorous and
simply fun to watch. Its
dynamic editing is note-
worthy, funnier sequences
alternate with moments of
deep reflection (campfire
scene being hands down
the most poignant of the
year) and the take on sex
scenes is as unusual as it is
amusing. My Own Private
Idaho really stands out
with its unique dreamy
atmosphere.
PARASITE (2019)
Lastly, the only film on
my list that was actually
released in 2019. Having
heard only enthusiastic
reviews, I was really
looking forward to this
one and it did live up to
my expectations. It is
a story of two families
and a look on social ine-
qualities, but the less you
know before watching,
the better. Suffice it to
say, atmosphere changes
drastically throughout
the film, which makes
for an entertaining but
also thought-provoking
and aesthetically pleasing
experience. A rather
ambiguous ending is, in
my opinion, another perk
of this film, as it doesn’t
feel like a didactic tale but
gives you space for your
own interpretation and
judgement. Coming to the
UK in early 2020, this one
is not to be missed.

Taking a look at the best film’s viewed this year, I’ve bottled them up into 5 unmissable features to look at during

“It’s the
contrast
between the
sugar coating
and the desire
to manipulate
that makes
Dangerous
Liaisons
actually very
dark”
mainly thanks to incredi-
ble acting – Glenn Close
and John Malkovich both
give remarkable perfor-
mances and the tension
between them is insane.
Combine that with elabo-
rate costumes that inspire
haute couture fashion
designers to this day and
you won’t be able to take
your eyes off the screen.
Mind you, all these lavish
visuals and the abundance
of decoration are there
to hide true intentions of
main characters. It’s the
contrast between the sugar

much empathy

MY OWN PRIVATE
IDAHO (1991)
This is such a bitter-
sweet picture, entertaining
but also very touching.
One of the most impor-
tant films of the early
90s independent queer
cinema, it tells a story of
“It doesn’t give
out too much

which is one
of Broken

greatest
strengths”
