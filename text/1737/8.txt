Felix: Most students
probably aren’t
really aware that the
college has archives
– do you interact
with students a lot?
Some of them are – par-
ticularly the constituent
college unions – and I do
host evenings with differ-
ent groups. When I had
the City and Guilds Union
members in, they were
looking at their past pub-
lications, and they were
fascinated to see what
was acceptable to write
in the past that perhaps
wouldn’t be so now. But
they were sensible about
it, and they understand
the context. You need to
understand the context
of the time and history
is history; you can't and
you shouldn't attempt to
change history - but you
should learn from it.
What we do in the archive
is reflect the history of
the College and people’s
experience here – so
it doesn't matter what
the thing is, it could be
as simple as meeting
minutes, I like people to
bring me things!
Felix: When you talk
about having groups
in, what does that
experience look like?
We bring them into the
research room and bring
the materials they need
to them – which aren’t
always the things they
originally asked for!
Often their needs change
as their research does and
people don’t always know
the right thing to look for;
we need to interpret their
needs and use our exper-
tise to figure out where
they should look to find
their answers.
When student groups
come in it’s usually
focused around their own
deposits of their records,
like the RCSU’s Broad-
sheet or minute books
from old meetings. We
hold onto those things for
them, having the expertise
to manage it and the space
to store it, but it belongs
to them. As to access
for research, we need to
know what people want
exactly in order to assist
them to what they need,
which isn’t always what
they may ask for. We
need to drill down to their
real question, and this is
unique material, so we
have to supervise them
using it. We will provide
things digitally if request-
ed, but don’t allow people
to take pictures when
they come in – because,
for example, a lot of our
archive is copyrighted.
We are open to internal
and external researchers.
Felix: Something that
was raised to me by
one of the constitu-
ent unions, the CGCU,
was that Imperial as
an institution feels as
if it is phasing out its
own history at times
– does that ring true
for you?
I think there was this
notion that constituent
unions would become
‘chapters’, so people felt
that downgraded them.
My view is: Imperial is
so big now that you really
need to feel like you
belong to something. I
actually think constituent
college unions are really
important, to make people
feel like there is some-
thing they can get hold
of, that they can do their
part in, rather than a big
nebulous thing.
Felix: Do you think
the STEM focus here
leads people to
disregard the histo-
ry of the College at
times – operating in a
‘bubble’?
Not necessarily. I think
that people are very, very
busy, and that there’s
masses more knowledge
now than there used to
be and so there’s masses
more to learn. Courses
are very, very intensive.
So people don't have
the capacity to do what
students used to do, and
that sort of freedom
rather than anything else.
But students and other
sections of College use
our services a great deal.
Felix: What sort of
challenges do you
face in your role? I
would think College’s
expansion over the
years would make
things harder!
It does make things
slightly harder in terms
of volume. We try to
encompass as much as
we can. But within that,
we aren’t looking back,
but are rather looking
forward. We need to know
what’s happening now,
and we need to know what
is going to happen, in
order to make sure we get
in contact with the right
people to obtain and retain
important documents - so
our work is very forward
thinking, not so much
backward as people might
expect.
The electronic expansion
has also meant there’s
masses more to find. Email
especially is a challenge
for everybody! There is a
lot of material in emails,
and nobody globally has
come up with a solution
for keeping and sifting
through all that material.
Human nature makes it
hard – when people use a
particular email headline,
they don’t stick to that
topic; the conversation
moves onto other matters.
If everyone was very
disciplined and wrote
proper titles or subjects
and switched email chains
when discussing some-
thing else, it’d be much
easier to manage for them.
I think one of the biggest
challenges for the future is
