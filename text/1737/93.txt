in memory of
René, was set up in 2018
with some of René’s
closest friends and family,
aiming to sail across the
Atlantic with the poignant
message: asking for help
should not be as hard as
crossing an ocean.
The crew of novice
sailors, including ICBC
members and alumni,
have challenged them-
selves to take part in a
Trans-Atlantic yacht race
in memory of their friend
and to raise money for
charity. Partnered with the
charities Child Bereave-
ment UK and PAPYRUS,
Race4Rene supports cam-
paigns for more research
into methods for suicide
prevention and support for
young people suffering.

every aspect of crewing
the yacht, including
setting, taking down and
packing sails (including
spinnakers), reefing, all
manoeuvres, sail-trim-
ming, keeping a lookout,
steering, cooking, and
daily cleaning.
The Race4René crew
are currently tackling
gusts of wind at up to
30 knots during their
continuous 16-day race.
However, it’s more than
just plain race sailing; the
crew will arrive in Saint
Lucia, having achieved
something amazing.
Through thick and thin,
with each other’s support,
they crossed an ocean on a
small sailboat.
Out of a tragedy, it
is humbling to see the
amount of good that
has come, thanks to the
goodwill of those who
knew him and the deter-
mination of the communi-
ty to save lives and raise
awareness.
Mental health is not
a topic for a day or a
week; it should remain
a priority throughout the
year and these campaigns
are helping to do just that.
Share your stories with
your friends, talk about
things getting to you and
support each other.
“Be kind, for everyone
you know is fighting a
battle.”

ICHC: An Ode to Monday Night Training
I
t is 4:40 pm and I
haven’t got as much
work done as I’d
hoped today. Why?
A Marble Olympics
YouTube hole, mental
and emotional fatigue…
TikTok? It doesn’t really
matter. I log out of my
hard-earned library com-
puter and begin to pack
up. Another student has
noticed me stir and now
hovers near my desk like a
vulture over prey, ready to
settle in for the night shift.
As I leave the library and
begin to make my way to
the union, I am relieved
yet fearful thinking of the
work I have left behind,
envisaging the last-minute
all-nighters that lie ahead.
Monday night training
is kind of awful. You sit
in rush hour traffic for
over an hour, only to be
dropped in Harlington,
where it is always a few
degrees colder and a few
more degrees bleaker.
The bus back sees you
home by 10 pm if you’re
lucky, though for the
later session it is closer
to midnight. Sports clubs
are also expensive to be a
part of, and the prospect
of paying this expense
on top of £9k per year,
only to limit the time you
have to make the most of
the £9k investment seems
hard to justify. Yes, you’ll
land your dream job in
consulting and make up
for it eventually, but was it
because you put ‘member
of the hockey club’ under
the Other Interests section
of your CV? Probably not.
So why bother?
Playing sport at
Imperial makes little
sense, which is why you
should do it. Spending
20+ hours a week attend-
ing training, socials, and
matches with a group of
societies themselves
cannot be a source of this.
In teams the group men-
tality can be insidious,
and a conscious effort
must be made to have peer
pressure take people to
Harlington for five hours
on a grim Sunday without
leaving them uncomforta-
ble or unhappy at 7 pm on
a Wednesday.
It is important that we
as individuals carefully
consider the way we think
and behave, and in return
people on the outside
should be optimistic and
proactive and consider
joining.
