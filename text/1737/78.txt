The Do’s and Don’t of a Student Christmas Dinner:
THE BIRD
FOOD

A whole roast turkey
is the usual fare for a
Christmas dinner but
unless you are ready
to buy way ahead,
have an inordinate
amount of oven space,
and you don’t mind
the lengthy brining
and cooking process,
I would steer clear. A
poorly cooked turkey
is way worse than no
turkey at all. Similarly,
other large birds like
geese may be beyond
the capabilities of a
novice student chef.
Chicken is a safe
choice, its relatively
bland flesh a good
blank canvas for any
spice rubs or season-
ing mix you want to
employ. For larger
birds, consider cook-
ing it spatchcock. By
removing the back-
bone and squashing
the bird flat, you can
season more of its
surface and reduce
the cooking time!
Duck is a good substi-
tute for chicken if you
want to go up a level
in terms of flavour.
If you’re cooking for
a crowd, small birds
such as poussin or
guinea fowl may be
preferred and can be
easily sourced from
Deck your halls with boughs of holly because Christmas is fast approaching! As everyone
knows, the true meaning of Christmas is gorging yourself into a calorie-induced coma.

supermarkets. Not only
do they cook quicker
and give you time to
focus on other parts of
the meal, they’re also
easier to split than carv-
ing your way through
a single large bird and
trying to divide up the
spoils evenly.
Seasoning and flavour-
ing is up to you. A sim-
ple rub-down with olive
oil, salt, and pepper
before cooking will suf-
fice for most but if you
want to ensure loads
of flavour and plenty
of crispy skin, I rec-
ommend a dry brine.
Dry brining is basically
salting the meat in ad-
vance to impart flavour
and draw out some
moisture. Rubbing the
bird all over with salt
and some sugar before
placing in the fridge
(overnight for a large
bird or a few hours for
smaller birds) can make
a world of a difference
in the finished prod-
uct. Before roasting,
just rub some butter,
thyme, and crushed
garlic and you’re all set
to go.
In terms of actually
cooking your bird,
the instructions on
the packaging will do
a pretty good job in
telling you how long
the meat should take
to cook. Obviously,
a food thermometer
would be handy in
making sure you have
a perfectly cooked bird
all the way through but
simple tricks like stab-
bing to the bone and
watching to make sure
the juice runs perfect-
ly clear will work for
most cases. And if the
meat is unfortunately
still pink in the middle
after carving, you can
always just return it
to the oven for anoth-
er half hour or (in a
pinch), pop it in the
microwave.
NON-BIRD CENTREPEICE
I have to confess at
this stage that I don’t
believe in Christmas
dinners without a bird
at the centre. But for
the ornithophobes
out there, we have a
couple of options. A
whole roast ham can
be a good shout but a
good cured, smoked
bone-in ham can be
difficult to find at the
best of times. To be
honest, any roast meat
will do but I find that
beef is too fiddly for an
already stressful ven-
ture. If you’re up for
the challenge, a rack of
ribs (beef or lamb), are
a fancy and relatively
inexpensive addition to
the table.
For the vegetarians, the
much-maligned nut
roast is an option for
sure (check out Felic-
ity Cloake’s Guardian
article, How to cook the
perfect nut roast) but
there are definitely bet-
ter options out there.
While a mushroom
wellington or similar
vegetables-in-pastry are
a delicious treat, mak-
ing one from scratch
can be difficult and
ultimately risky (pastry
may fail, vegetables may
release too much steam
or stay undercooked).
A simple alternative
is a roast gourd like
a lovely stuffed and
roasted butternut
squash. Easy to do with
minimal prep, a drizzle
of olive oil and some
seasoning along with
a healthy topping of
quinoa, pine nuts, and
peppers may be all you
need to make a beau-
tiful rainbow-coloured
main.
POTATOES
The only acceptable
form of starch for this
dinner is potato. And
a good roast potato is
important to master
for any other roast
dinners you may want
to make going forward.
The potato choice is
important as you want
something nice and
starchy to crisp in the
oven. You’ll see all
sorts of potato varieties
mentioned online but
faced with a Sains-
bury’s Local, you’re
not likely to be faced
with an overwhelming
amount of choice. For
your purposes, any-
thing that isn’t a new
potato or salad potato
will serve you well. Just
remember to give the
potatoes a good shake
in a colander after par-
boiling to give you the
rough edges for brown-
ing in the oven.
Mashed potato is also
a good choice, espe-
cially with limited oven
space. You can play
around with textures by
adjusting the amount
of milk or cream you
add. Just remember to
salt liberally and use
an excess of butter. Top
with some parsley to
add some colour to the
dish.
