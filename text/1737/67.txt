Sir GeoffreyWilkinson: Imperial’s honoured chemist
& recipient of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
If you’re not a Chemistry student, or even if you are, you may have not heard of this famous Nobel laureate and
Imperial alumnus. But you should.

A
ny student who
has been to
the Chemistry
Café would
have seen the portrait of
Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson
at least once. Lying at
the back of the café, with
more pictures dotted
throughout the building,
and even his research
paper framed right out-
side, he surely must be
of importance. While
most of us Chemistry
students would know him,
his legacy is less known
throughout Imperial, and
even less understood
past the Department of
Chemistry. Who really
was he? What did he ac-
tually do to contribute to
science?
Sir Geoffrey Wilkin-
son was born and raised
in Springside, a small
village in West Yorkshire
by Henry and Ruth
Wilkinson, a master house
painter and weaver. Since
his youth, he developed
an interest in chemistry
through his uncle, who
had started a company
making Epsom and Glau-
ber’s salt for pharmaceuti-
cal companies, frequently
tagging along to lab and
company visits.
As a teenager, he
attended secondary school
in Todmorden: a school
with an interesting history
and eventual coincidence.
He was educated by the
same Physics teacher
as Sir John Cockcroft,
who went on to receive
a Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1951, as Sir Wilkinson
did himself in the field of
Chemistry.
In 1939, he received
a scholarship to study at
Imperial, and eventually
graduated with a PhD
in 1941, during World
War II. He continued
his research at Imperial
under the guidance of
Professor Briscoe (whom
the current Briscoe Lab in
the Chemistry Building is
named after), and joined
theAtomic Energy Project
in 1943, finding multiple
new isotopes through
the project. Having been
advised against taking
up an academic position
in nuclear chemistry in
England by Briscoe, Sir
Wilkinson eventually
returned to his original
interest of transition metal
complexes.
Back at Imperial in
1956, he devoted nearly
all of his time to transi-
tion metals, especially to
ruthenium, rhodium and
rhenium in unsaturated
hydrocarbons and metal
hydrogen bonds. This
lead to his first famous
namesake - Wilkinson’s
catalyst - a rhodium-based
coordinate complex with
the formula RhCl(PPh)3,
which Sir Wilkinson
himself popularised the
use of. His catalytic
organometallic studies
eventually furthered the
development of such
coordination complexes
in these specific elements.
This catalyst is also used
widely in alkene hydro-
genation, amongst others,
such as hydroacylation or
hydroboration, and even
set the basis for ongoing
asymmetric catalysis
research.
His next finding, which
won him the Nobel Prize
in 1973, was regarding the
structure of ferrocene - a
compound consisting of
one iron metal centre
placed between two cyclo-
pentadienes. Curious after
reading about this newly
synthesised mysterious
compound in the news, Sir
Wilkinson worked hard to
determine its structure and
synthesise other similar
compounds, now known
as metallocenes. Met-
allocenes are now used
as active homogenous
catalysts in specialized
reactions, such as olefin
polymerisation, with
further applications being
in rechargeable lithium
batteries, food packaging
and carbon nanotubes.
On a personal level,
he is remembered as a
curious, driven and en-
thusiastic person. His love
for Chemistry prevailed
despite all setbacks, and
while it may have seemed
challenging to his peers
and students, it proved
well for his legacy.
Sir Wilkinson’s story is
one of passion, hard work,
and eventual success.
This does not happen to
everyone - in fact, it is
quite unlikely to occur.
It is the story of a young
boy who had a passion
for chemistry, chose to
pursue it, and eventually
achieved the prize of
highest recognition in the
field. He reignited interest
and further developed the
field of organometallics,
spearheading it to become
one of the major fields in
chemistry and chemical
research today. His
contributions to the field
are immense, pioneering
countless catalytic pro-
cesses, impacting both
research and development
of industrial applications.
Yet, as impossible as
it may sound, it truly
happened in this modern
day and age. One may say
that it requires a person of
a certain calibre to achieve
such successes, however,
while knowledge and
academic ability were
certainly main factors, it
was only made possible
through his passion,
perseverance, and drive to
succeed.
As a fellow student, I
find his story quite inspir-
ing. There are times when
all of us feel like giving up
- some of us think of this
occasionally, others much
more often. Our degrees
are also so different that
it is quite impossible to
compare them. However,
whenever we feel down or
have lost hope, it is stories
like these which, be it by
believing that success
is more probable, or by
reminding ourselves of
our passions, will give us
a little optimism, and just
a small flame of hope that
everything will eventually
turn out alright.
As this issue of Felix
celebrates our 70th anni-
versary, this article cele-
brated and remembered
the contributions of one
of our former members
of staff to the field of
organometallic chemistry.

Wilkinson, we recom-
mend the piece he wrote
on the official Nobel Prize
website, or speaking to
the many professors from
the Chemistry department
who remember him.
