16% were international
(today, there are ~4,200
undergraduate engineers,
of whom 64% are inter-
national). Felix was also
started by two Guildsmen,
E.M. Hughes (the first
editor) and D.C. Howe
(then CGCU President).
To celebrate this, we’re
going to give you a whis-
tle-stop tour of what some
departments were like in
1949.
Computing, Bioen-
gineering and Design
Engineering didn’t exist
- the courses only being
55, 17 and 5 years old
respectively.
Aeronautics was
founded in 1909, with
Sir Arnold Hall as Head
of Department. In 1949,
he introduced a new
aeronautics course in
which the students would
spend their first two years
studying mechanical
engineering and only
specialise in aeronautics
in their 3rd year (though
this is no longer the case).
The structure of the
Electrical Engineering
degrees was also different
back then - with first
year being broader than
it is now with students
only being allowed to
specialise only in the third
and final year. It was even
possible for students to
study 1 day a week at the
LSE!
Chemical Engineering
consisted of a single
building, Bone. In 1949,
a pilot plant lab was
I
t’s remarkable to
see how much engi-
neering at Imperial
has developed over
the past 70 years. The
College’s Rector (now
“President”) was Sir
Roderic Hill, a Royal
Airforce commander
during WWII, and Alfred
Pippard was Dean of the

fitted and a lift of 9sq ft
installed into the stairwell.
D.M. Newitt, director of
scientific research at the
UK’s Special Operations
Executive, began major
experiments to extend
enthalpy data for steam to
1000 bar and 700 degrees
- this data being in the
steam tables you know
and love today.
In Civil Engineering,
Prof Pippard was Head
of Department, having
a major inﬂuence in
modernising the teaching
of structural analysis.
Environmental and Water
Resource Engineering
began in 1949 following
a visit to London by a
Harvard Professor. With
3 years funding from the
Rockefeller Foundation
this academic, F.E. Bruce
established a joint Public
Health Engineering
course with the London
School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine.
The Mechanical
Engineering department
suffered heavily as a
result of WWII. Many
staff from the University
of Warsaw stayed on,
and equipment from
German research centres
was installed. Industrial

In the year 1949, 95
engineering degrees were
awarded (compared to the
~1400 that were awarded
this year). There were
227 students, of which

It’s important to sit back
and reﬂect on the history
that underpins our depart-
ments today; numerous
inﬂuential professors
and alumni have walked
through the buildings we
often complain about.
If we have piqued your
interest and you’d like to
learn more about College
history, plan a visit to the
College Archives, which
has a wealth of history for
you to browse.
