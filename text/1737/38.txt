L
et me start this
by saying this is
by no means an
exhaustive list.
I’m sure there’s shows
that I haven’t got around
to seeing yet that are just
as great or even better
than the stuff on this
list. So, before you get
all angry at me for not
including Breaking Bad
or Westworld on the list,
it’s only because I didn’t
include anything I haven’t
seen every episode of. I
do seem to be partial to
a good comedy (a fact I
hadn’t quite realised until
I had to make this list).
Another running theme
in this list seems to be
that all these shows have
made me… feel? Not
necessarily feel anything
in particular… just, all the
feels. Without further ado,
here are the shows that I
really enjoyed the last ten
years.
1. Schitt’s Creek (2015
- present)
My love for this show
is something else. I’ll
admit that I was late to
the party, having started
to watch the show just as
its fifth season was about
to conclude. Now, fully
caught up, I am doing a
complete rewatch of the
series ahead of its final
season, premiering in
January. Schitt’s Creek is
perhaps the funniest show
I’ve ever seen, putting
its characters through the
most ridiculous situations,
although still finding a
way to remain real and
grounded. The first few
seasons are pure comedy
gold. However, starting
with its second season
finale, the show evolves
into something so much
more, displaying character
growth across the board
that is unparalleled. If
you’re still not on board,
please be my guest and
jump on.
2. Parks and Recrea-
tion (2009-2015)
Parks and Rec is
probably the first sitcom
that I fell completely in
love with. Set in a fiction-
al town in Indiana called
Pawnee, the show focuses
on the employees of the
Parks and Recreation de-
partment of the local gov-
ernment. Each character
in Parks and Rec is iconic.
As if that’s not enough, it’s
given birth to one of my
favourite sayings in the
entire universe; Treat Yo’
Self. Finally, unlike other
entries on this list, the
ending of the show was
absolutely perfect, with
just enough fan service
to please the viewers, and
a 100% commitment to
everything the show has
been over the years.
3. Fleabag (2016 -
2019)
Having been born as a
one woman stage show at
first, it’s no surprise that
its TV show adaptation
has become a complete
hit. Phoebe Waller-Bridge
navigates the character
effortlessly, and explores
that it truly means to be
human. It’s a special show.
Even the funniest jokes
has a deeper meaning that
gives the show its unique
tone - one which makes
you and breaks you at the
same time.
4. Veep (2012 - 2019)
Chronicling the adven-
tures of Selina Meyer,
the Vice President of the
United States (VP, Veep
for short), the show has
been vastly popular on
the other side of the pond.
Adapted from the British
comedy, The Thick of
It, Veep is a display of
the cutthroat culture in
politics. Julia Louis-Drey-
fus has pretty much won
every single award under
the sun for her perfor-
mance as the fictional vice
president, and deservedly
so. Veep is a show with
no likeable characters,
who are at worst horrible
human beings, and at best,
absolutely incompetent.
And it is glorious.
5. Orange is the New
Black (2013 - 2019)
I always think of
Orange as the OG Netflix
original show. Although
the initial hype around
the show died down long
before the series conclud-
ed, it has made a mark
in my brain, mainly for
its poignant storytelling.
Despite its occasionally
annoying characters, the
show found a way to keep
touching on important,
extremely relevant issues
sensitively yet with a
firm standpoint. I may not
always agree with them,
but I commend them for
doing and saying things
most would be scared to.
6. The Good Place
(2016 - present)
Following her untimely
death, Eleanor Shellstrop
finds herself at the Good
Place (in other words,
heaven), only to quickly
realise that she doesn’t
belong there. For the
majority of the first
season, despite wondering
where they’d take the
show, I was convinced
that the show would
remain a simple study
of what makes humans
good or bad. There could
only be so much trouble
in paradise, you know?
(See what I did there?)
I was wrong. With what
I can only describe as a
genius twist, the show
became something else.
Another shocking twist
at the end of season two
also changed the game for
the viewers. Although the
third season was slightly
wonky, it did have some
of the highest highs of
the entire series (Janets,
anyone?). Set to conclude
in the next few months,
The Good Place has been
a pleasure to watch. Who
doesn’t love Kristen Bell
anyway?
7. The Crown (2016
- present)
I’ve always had a
mild fascination with
the Royals. Turns out,
so has everyone else,
given the popularity of
this show. Now in its
second cast (following the
conclusion of season 2,
Olivia Colman and Tobias
Menzes took over the roles
from Claire Foy and Matt
Smith to portray older
versions of Queen Eliza-
beth II and Prince Phillip
respectively). Overall, the
show is breathtaking and
elegant. It has some of the
best acting on television,
with both iterations of the
Royal Family delivering
a masterclass in acting. I
for one cannot wait to feel
like I’m peeking into the
Buckingham Palace.
8. Game of Thrones
(2011 - 2019)
On one hand, it hurts
me to put this show this
low on the list, but also
hurts me to put it this high.
While it was still being
adapted from books, the
show was excellent. Had
the quality been kept
up, it would have easily
topped this list. However,
once the showrunners sur-
passed the source material
at the end of season 5, the
quality of the show went
downhill. The final season
specifically was so rushed
that it left pretty much
every viewer dissatisfied.
At its best, though, the
show delivered some of
the biggest moments of
TV history. I don’t regret
watching it one bit, but
I regret watching that
finale.
9. Black Mirror (2011 -
present)
This is a weird one,
as it doesn’t follow the
structure of a convention-
al show. Each episode is
independent of the rest,
and they all touch on the
impact of technology on
people’s lives in one way
or another, mostly leaving
the viewers feeling terri-
fied or broken. Its recent,
‘choose-your-own-adven-
ture’-type episode was
pretty much revolution-
ary, and honestly quite
fun. Obviously, some of
the stories they opt to tell
are better than others, but
when it’s good, it tends to
be excellent.
10. The Big Bang The-
ory (2007 - 2019)
One of the longest run-
ning sitcoms on American
TV, The Big Bang The-
ory is one of the defin-
ing shows of the decade,
providing n enjoyable
glimpse into the lives of
a group of scientists As
the show started to focus
more on relationships and
to abandon the science
jokes and character build-
ing, the quality did suffer
slightly. However, having
recently concluded its
run, the ending felt true to
what the show has always
been about. Friendship.
I didn’t know I could care so deeply about these Schitt’s Creek characters... and
deeply flawed ones at best // Pop TV
