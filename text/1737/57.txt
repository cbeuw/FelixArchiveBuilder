The second summer
of love
When house and tech-
no came to the UK, they
very quickly caught fire.
Like the British invasion
of the American rock
scene twenty years prior,
American sounds now
conquered Britain, and
offshoots of the original
sounds – most promi-
nently acid house, hard-
core and rave – fuelled
what became known
as the second summer
of love. MDMA, aban-
doned warehouses in
late-Thatcherian Britain,
fields in Somerset, and
masses of youths with
a point to prove started
a movement which still
resonates in the hearts of
every diligent clubgoer
today.
The mud is up to your
ankles, some guy named
Fred keeps telling you
he loves your shirt and
asking you for gum, and
the soundsystem spreads
like a giant, throbbing
spider all around the
ant-colony mass of
people. There are tens of
thousands of you. Maybe
hundreds of thousands.
Whydidyoudrivehalfthe
way across the country to
jump wildly for one night
only with strangers to
music which sounds like
it could be the score to an
alien invasion? Because
this is what being human
is about. Seeing other
people go just as nuts as
you and revelling with
them in the unadulter-
ated spontaneity of the
moment. As if you were
naked, you are you in
your purest sense. You do
it for the ecstasy.
To talk about the path
of electronic music in the
UK from that point on, I
would need a whole new
article. For the record,
most noteworthy new
genres over the next two
decades originated here.
From jungle, via DnB,
garage, and finally to
dubstep (almost coming
full circle to a warpedly
bassy version of what
originally came over
on the reverse techno
Mayflower), the genres
spawning from that first
impact are both diverse
and exciting.

When the curtain
falls
No overview of the
electronic music story
would be complete
without its current
spiritual home. No city
in the world has an elec-
tronic scene as vibrant
as Berlin’s. Drawing
parallels with Detroit,
what allowed Berlin to
become the mecca of
electronic music was the
post-industrial landscape
following the fall of the
iron curtain and German
reunification. The
positive energy which ac-
companied the fall of the
wall helped propel many
movements for equality
and peace. And whether
it was love parades or
protests against needless
wars - the anthem of
the marching in Berlin
was most likely techno.
The smooth and coldly
melodic sound of German
electronic music is one
of the most vital compo-
nents of the burgeoning
scene.
Getting into Berghain:
is it worth it or not?
Standing out in the cold
for hours at a time only to
be told to get lost with a
simple shake of the head?
Getting intimidated by
the mighty shades-at-
night-and-white-tuxedo-
wearing, face-tattooed
snake charmer that is
Sven (Berghain’s inim-
itable head bouncer)?
Nervously holding your
breath as he decides
whether you’re worth
letting in? Many have
their objections.
The key to the success
of Berlin’s clubs is the
atmosphere that rules
inside them. It is an
incredible feat that they
were able to translate the
German nous for perfec-
tion and efficiency into
something as ephemeral
as clubbing. To sum up,
I’ll share what a couple
who apologetically said
they don’t speak German
got told by some bouncers
in Berlin: “Stop telling
people where you’re
from or who you are.
Nobody gives a fuck.”
Electronic music is
freedom: freedom of ex-
perimentation, freedom
of expression, freedom
of love. It is the apex on
the mountain of proof
that there is nothing as
powerful in this world as
music. In a world where
little makes sense, music
always holds the torch –
may we march to the beat
of four to the floor.
In the spotlight
Many will say that the
best days of electronic
music are now behind us,
and that the world is in
needofanewandexciting
form of music. Even
Nina Kraviz, the techno
queen herself, has said
that the last truly original
new genre invented was
dubstep, and that most of
modern house and techno
is made up of rehashing
old sounds: nothing truly
fresh has happened here
since times of Chicago
and Detroit.
I for one, disagree. The
modern day beatmaker
can be anyone, and we are
currently experiencing
a revolution of bedroom
musicians. Lo-fi house
especially has seen a
whole everest of musi-
cians flock to Youtube to
flaunt their compositions
over some faux-nostalgic
VHS footage.
Indeed, it seems
that electronic music is
experiencing some form
of revival. It has been
popping up in main-
stream culture with an air
of reverence, and perhaps
even a little bit of nos-
talgia. Good examples
of this are Gaspar
Noe’s film Climax, the
soundtrack to which
was basically a best-of
album of everything
from very late disco to
acid house and 90s rave
and breakbeat. Similar-
ly, Saatchi Gallery, in
the heart of London’s
poshest neighbourhood,
ran an exhibition on rave
culture this past summer,
which covered the second
summer of love in great
detail and with heartfelt
sincerity.
These are examples
that show that society has
largely come to accept
that electronic music is
here to stay, and has come
to appreciate the cultural
significance of its roots.
Besides this, the rise of
superclubs and gigantic
electronic music festivals
has shown that there is
a wider appreciation for
the genre. As always,
mass commoditisation of
music will have its draw-
backs. Some problems
currently plaguing the
industry are the skyrock-
eting DJ fees putting pro-
moters out of business,
and the rise of megaclubs
offering lineups which
rival festivals, which are
taking away business
from smaller clubs, and
therefore shutting down
the stages where the next
big thing might have
announced themselves.
With music becoming
more and more accessi-
ble, and the digitalisation
of the world making
it incredibly facile to
access content, it will be
interesting to see how
this affects electronic
music. There will always
be new sounds to explore,
new formats to try, and
new ways to make people
dance.
One thing is for sure:
the story of electronic
music will only keep
twisting on and on.
