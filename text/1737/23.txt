come and how far do we have left to go?
in the theatre community,
at least more so than those
who have never stepped
into a theatre before.
Content and Context
I suppose it’s common
sense that if the content
of a show caters towards
a young audience, they’d
be more likely to see it.
Word of mouth alone
should be enough to draw
some young people to
the theatre. Some recent
examples to what I
consider to be ‘approach-
able content’ include
Hamilton, Six and Dear
Evan Hansen. The former
two, although focusing
on historic events way
before our time, have
found a way to make
themselves extremely
relevant. Hamilton is a
‘rap musical’ about one of
the founding fathers of the
United States, and Six is
a raging girl band concert
about Henry VIII’s wives.
Dear Evan Hansen, on
the other hand, is written
about young people, for
young people, touching
on important issues that
of audiences that are no-
ticeably younger. I’ve met
many teenagers and young
adults while watching
Dear Evan Hansen and
Hamilton, some of whom
had travelled to the UK
from across Europe.
However, it must be
noted here that all this
means nothing, when
tickets for these shows,
namely Hamilton, cost an
arm and a leg. Upwards
of 200 pounds in some
instances. Charging
almost-unprecedented
(and thus most likely
unwarranted) amounts for
such shows is greedy, and
defeats its own purpose.
Podcasts
This is an odd one. A
few years back, a group of
very creative individuals
came up with the idea of a
‘musical podcast’, with an
original story and original
compositions, free for all
to enjoy on all the usual
podcast platforms. Their
first challenge was to
write a musical that the
listeners would be satis-
fied with simply listening,
and would not leave
feeling like they need to
see it staged on a show.
The result was a three-act
musical called 36 Ques-
tions, starring Jonathan
Groff (Hamilton, Glee,
Mindhunter) and Jessie
Shelton (Hadestown,
Waitress), both of whom
are respected, well-known
Broadway actors. And
boy, does it work.
I discovered this
project only a couple of
months ago. However, a
quick google search leads
to a plethora of articles
published around the time
of its release that calling
the project ‘the future of
musical theatre’. I’m not
sure that I would go that
far.
This specific project
is excellent, and does
provide a way for anyone
with an internet connec-
tion to be able to enjoy
a musical free of charge.
Everyone involved do
a wonderful job and the
final product is entertain-
ing and original, however,
I am not quite sure if it
the one existing follow-up
project (from a completely
different team), Anthem:
Homunculus, starring an
endless number of iconic
Broadway stars including,
Cynthia Erivo and Glenn
Close, has exclusively
been made available on
a paid podcast platform.
I don’t know how much
this platform costs, and
I’m not sure I really care.
It just makes me feel sad,
knowing that a group of
people have taken this
selfless idea that origi-
nated with 36 Questions
(their only revenue would
be from the small ads that
play before each episode),
and charge people for it.
Once again, the theatre
community found another
way to defeat its own
purpose.
Just a small note here:
between starting to write
and finishing this article,
a two minute trailer for
a new project called
Childish: The Podcast
Musical has made its way
onto the internet. A quick
google search shows that
this project was brought
to life as a result of a
campaign that raised
around £1700. From
what I gather, this will
be more along the lines
of 36 Questions in terms
of broad availability. So
maybe all is not lost for
musical podcasts after all.
Only time will tell.
In conclusion, I
honestly do think that
over the years we’ve
made great progress when
it comes to audience di-
versification. Solid efforts
have been made, be it
through discount schemes
or bringing theatre to you
in the form of podcasts.
However, there’s still a
long way to go, especially
since greed seems to be
playing a role in gatekeep-
ing the barrier between
the theatre and the youth.
