“Yes, you
might gain a
million pounds
whilst you’re
there, but
it will be so
worth it...”
for a weekend escape here
in the summer, as that’s
when the accommodation
rates in the city are lowest,
and then you can splash
out a bit more on food and
pay a visit to one of the
city’s remarkable Miche-
lin-starred restaurants.
Germany
Visiting Germany
doesn’t just mean paying
a visit to Berlin. We’ve
decided to explore our
options a little more and
Hamburg, Germany’s
second-largest city, has
certainly caught our eye.
The red light district,
Reeperbahn, is one of
the most famous in the
world, and is full of bars
and shops that are bound
to set your spirits alive.
As a maritime city, the
waterfront has so much
to offer – from parks and
seaside restaurants, to
boat tours and shopping,
Hamburg is a world of its
own. Looking for hearty
German food and beer?
Try Cologne. This city,
which sits by the Rhine
river, is one of Germany’s
culture gems with over
thirty museums and some
of the most authentic
German restaurants. Want
to experience something a
little different? Try their
famous Dunkelrestaurant,
where you can dine in
pitch black, which is
meant to simulate blind-
ness, and is the experience
of a lifetime.
If all of this sounds
tempting but you’re
worried about finances,
fear not – flights to both
Hamburg and Cologne
are about £30 return, and
hostels are abundant and
quite cheap all over both
cities, so get your bags
and let’s go!
Poland
Want a picturesque
destination that is bound
to spice up your Insta-
gram? Look no further.
Book that £24 return
flight and pay a visit to
Europe’s largest medieval
marketplace, located in
Kraków, Poland. As one
of the cities that escaped
the worst of the WWII
bombings, Kraków
has a certain old-world
character to it, and its
Jewish district is packed
with lively art galleries,
buoyant restaurants and
cute little cafes. Whilst
there, you’ll have to pay
a visit to the Wawel Royal
Castle, which is a symbol
of the independent Polish
state, with gothic-style
architecture that is ab-
solutely jaw-dropping.
Fancy staying in the
capital and exploring
more of Warsaw? Also
a fantastic decision!
The Polish capital has a
dynamic nightlife, but
even more impressive is
the decades of wartime
history that is evident
everywhere, from all the
renowned museums and
memorials to the striking
cobbled streets. Hostels
and budget hotels are
dotted around the city, es-
pecially in the Old Town,
and start from about £20 a
night for a single. Time to
get booking…
Belgium
One thing – Belgian
waffles. That’s it. That’s
all we have to say. Okay,
maybe we’ll try and
persuade you a little more
but honestly the waffles
will make you never want
to leave when you get
there. Or maybe the fries
will do that (did you know
French fries originated in
Belgium, not France?).
Or maybe the Belgian
chocolate will. Basically,
any and all food you try in
Belgium is guaranteed to
be absolutely incredible,
and yes you might gain
a million pounds whilst
you’re there, but it will
be so worth it. Looking
for something to help the
food go down? Some fine
Belgian beer is always
just around the corner,
and with over 1000
breweries, you’re bound
to find the beer that sits
just right with you. Walk
it all off by exploring one
of Belgium’s beautiful
cities such as Brussels,
or the dreamy town of
Bruges, both of which
have such rich history and
are riddled with jaw-drop-
ping art. Return flights
to Brussels are about £29
each, and hostels tend to
cost around £17 a night,
meaning you could easily
spend a weekend there on
about £70, and it’s worth
saving up and taking a
bit more because you’re
going to want to try
everything in sight!
