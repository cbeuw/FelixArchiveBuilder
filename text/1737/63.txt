Halo Reach on PC: A Perfect Port, but a Flawed Game
Eight years after its release on Xbox 360, the iconic game makes its way to PC with a port by 343 Industries. Felix
Games breaks down the good and the bad, tinged by a sense of childish joy and nostalgia

L
et me make one
thing clear: I
am absolutely
biased. Halo
Reach was a significant
part of my teenagedom;
I spent a frankly un-
healthy amount of hours
sprinting around the wide
landscapes and vast alien
structures of the original
game. It defined my social
life – I’d host huge all-
night LAN parties with
my friends, joined online
fan groups where I made
years-long friends across
continents and oceans.
We’d all rush home from
school to play every night.
I don’t say this as a
disclaimer, but rather to
highlight that this is one
of those games which
means more to me – and
to many others – than
just the quality of its me-
chanics and gameplay. It’s
condensed and purified
nostalgia, splattered
across my laptop screen in
glorious high-resolution
in an attempt to digitally
recreate the feeling of
childhood itself. So many
people have been excited
for so long to see this
game re-release in an
accessible format.
Does it live up to the
hype? Well, yes. And no.
The story is as
engaging as ever – it’s not
Dostoyevsky, but it does
provide a significantly
more compelling story
than almost any other
competitive-style FPS.
This is what set aside
Halo from the get-go
in the early 2000s; its
dedication to constructing
a world, lore, and – in
Reach at least – charac-
ters that are engaging
and capture the sense of
wonder, scale, mystery,
and often downright
creepiness that defines the
series. Technical issues do
mar the campaign experi-
ence – while multiplayer
has dedicated servers,
campaign is only support-
ed via player-to-player
connections, resulting
in high input lag even
for players in the same
country.
The game itself plays
fantastically at standard
settings. It’s a marvel-
lous port – it’s broadly
unmarred by the issues
we associate with the
word ‘port’ itself. I’m still
scarred by my attempts
to play Dark Souls on
PC using a mouse and
keyboard. Halo Reach
contains few of those
errors. Animations play
smoothly, the gunplay
feels fluid and true to the
original, even despite the
change to a mouse and
keyboard input. Halo
multiplayer was always
defined by its unique
feeling when compared
to other competitors like
Call of Duty or Battlefield,
one that valued aspects
such as consistent aiming
and longer gunfights than
instant reactions and snap
headshots. They have
successfully maintained
that sensation, and it is a
joy to experience.
The AI, too, has ported
successfully. Bungie was
famous for its AI back
in the days of Halo: CE;
the utilisation of different
tactics or styles of combat
by different enemies made
combat dynamic and
frenetic, with variation
in gameplay that was
fundamental to the quality
of the campaign. And, as
ever, where theAI stutters,
there is always a Brute
with a Gravity Hammer
to kick things back up a
notch.
However, one core
gameplay issue is the
heavily magnetised aim
assist. They’ve included
support for both controller
and mouse and keyboard,
with the key differentiator
being that using a control-
ler bequeaths the player
some of the strongest aim
assist in modern shooters.
It can make online games
feel rather unfair when
trying to enjoy the PC
experience many people
have been waiting for,
and I anticipate that the
aim assist will be nerfed
in future – or, optimally,
an option would be
enabled to search for aim
assist-disabled games.
The graphical
smoothness also runs
into problems if a player
unlocks their framerate.
Players have reported
issues with screen tearing,
as well as animations
only running at a flat
60fps – meaning that at
higher frames-per-second,
animations will skip over
frames or, in the worst case
scenario, end up non-line-
ar due to ‘averaging out’
the 60fps animation over
an arbitrary fps set by the
player. There are also very
few customisation options
for graphics: a failure to
utilise one of the strongest
advantages PC has over
console.
However, naturally,
with higher resolution
and enhanced graphics,
the game still looks ten
times better than it did in
2011 – and I played that
version until my fingers
damn-near bled, so I have
no qualms about diving
into a visually improved
port. The visuals get a
thumbs-up from me, with
the hope that they develop
customisation further
during the broader Master
Chief Collection develop-
ment.
Sound quality is, unfor-
tunately, a let-down. Yes,
booting it up and hearing
thaticonicsoundtrackplay
through my headphones
had me literally jumping
for joy and, of course,
singing along in a broken
baritone. However, the
SFX are, frankly, broken
– they sound significantly
worse than the original
game. The sound of guns,
vehicles, and other effects
are muffled and lacking in
impact, sounding woolly
– it can, at the worst
moments, feel as if you
are playing underwater.
Halo is, I would argue,
one of the few shooters
in which immersion
and sound are important
beyond the potential
impact on competitive-
ness, precisely because of
the brilliant world-build-
ing it employs. I would
anticipate a future fix for
this problem, but for the
moment it’s the largest
downside the game has.
Outside of the game
itself, 343 has completely
reworked every aspect –
sadly, for the worse. The
old progression system,
in which levels unlocked
cosmetic items which
were then bought with
credits earned in-game,
has been replaced with a
substantial downgrade.
New cosmetic items
are only unlockable in
turn as one levels up, a
predetermined item per
level-up. This is objec-
tively just worse than the
original’s system, and it
is mind-boggling that 343
decided to implement it.
Menus have also
suffered, with a clunky
UI and unintuitive design.
Again, key features have
been removed – the
original allowed players
in a lobby to vote between
several map and game
mode options, whereas
this is now randomised.
Why?
As a final note – 343
did make one inspired
decision, which was to
releasethegameonSteam.
The platform provides
two major benefits: ease
of accessibility and popu-
larity, and a decent infra-
structure for mod support.
343 have enabled mod
support on the game – and
this might be pure genius.
The highlight of many
Halo players’ experiences
were the custom game
modes and Forge map
variants – the creativity
of players was massively
celebrated and enabled.
Now imagine what we can
do with mods!
With that said, where
does the verdict fall?
Overall, it’s a fantastic
port, but a flawed game.
Every aspect kept and
ported from the original
game works like a charm,
which is high praise in
itself – ports are notorious
for, in short, sucking.
However, the places
where 343 decided to
override the original
design or implement their
own features (such as the
framerate unlocking) are
almost universally flawed
in their implementation or
fundamental concept.
