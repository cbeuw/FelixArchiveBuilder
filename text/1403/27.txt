It’s been a busy couple of weeks for
the honourable members of the Kendo
Club. Just before the Easter Break the
team marched off to Cambridge to
take part in the annual UK University
Competition. Imperial was off to try to
best our showing of a year previously
where we claimed joint third with some
lesser university (methinks it was Ox-
ford…). The team consisted of a mix of
dan grades, Takayuki Myoshi (Taisho),
Theo Rutter (2nd in command and
winner of ACC Full Colours), Gareth
Morris (proud holder of a large beard)
and two ikkyus (Christos Argryakis
and Tim Simpson).
The team competition began in ear-
nest after a stern lecture from a visiting
Japanese 7th Dan who laid down the
rules and tried to get some semblance
of discipline on the bunch of unruly
students. First up our team came up
against one from Oxford- who we hap-
pily managed to beat. Theo Rutter and
Capt. Myoshi showed how best to cut
wrists and heads, and the other mem-
bers of our team fighting their oppo-
nents to draws. Our next foes were the
UCL team- who had a formidable mix
of grades and experience. Unfortunate-
ly this team proved too much for our
number to contain and we lost by two
matches. Due to the vagaries of on-the-
spot re-organisation, where once we
would have gone on for further fights,
the pool system was dropped meaning
that Imperial was out of the competi-
tion, which UCL went on to win.
Luckily all was not lost, as after lunch
the individual matches took place. Re-
venge was had as both Tim Simpson
and Christos Argryakis progressed
to the quarter finals of the kyu grade
competition (beating UCL opponents
previously seen in the team matches).
But the best was yet to come. Takayuki
Myoshi and Theo Rutter progressed all
the way to the later stages of the dan
grade competition. In the semi, Theo
just pipped Takayuki to the victory
with a good cut to the men. Takayuki
was out, but with a well deserved third
medal. Finally, in a show stopper Theo
Rutter (2nd Dan) managed to over-
come Nagumo (4th Dan) of Oxford in
a final that went into encho (overtime
“first cut wins”). Therefore Mr. Rutter
lays claim to being the best Dan-grade
University student in the country. Not
surprising really as he is on the British
National team and was competing at
the European Championship ...
In our next outing the team took part
in the first London Cup (organised by
the University of the Arts, London). A
fantastically charged event with over
170 competitors from across Europe,
including national teams from Italy,
Portugal, and Sweden this competi-
tion was spread over two days. Unfor-
tunately, injury and unforeseen events
meant two of our number couldn’t
attend as planned. Nevertheless, un-
daunted, and with a member of the
Madrid kendo club standing in (name
of Yolanda Rubio) our team (featur-
ing Chris Tang, Tim Simpson, Eugene
Baxter, and Pichit Hongsaranagon) did
battle against that very same Madrid
kendo club. Unfortunately fate did not
shine on us that day, and although we
put up a good fight gaining two draws
and with one of the newbies (Eugene)
to the shiai court scoring an excellent
kote against his opponent, our more
able adversaries won the day. A pity
but still a good learning experience.
The team competition was won by the
Italian National Team, who through-
out the competition had been getting
perfect scores.
The individuals the next day proved
slightly more fruitful. Tim Simpson
managed to scare his opponent from
the ring twice, winning a point that
meant he moved to the next round.
Unhappily, he then encountered a dan
grade of UCL (Stephane Helstroffer)
who managed to overcome his block-
ing and end his winning streak with a
cut to the wrist and head. This chap
then went on to win joint third place
overall, whilst first place went to H.
Miyatake of Wakaba club, London.
So all in all a mixed bag of goodies.
Some won, some lost with a little bit of
glory for the club garnered on the way.
