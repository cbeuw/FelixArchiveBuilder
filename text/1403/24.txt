Fun & Games
Virgo
Post-apocalyptic
impotence isn’t
nearly as fun as you
thought it would
be. It’s as bad as
that night you spent
listening to the guy next door fucking his
labrador. You almost call the NSPCC but then
realised that it’s for kids. Come to think of it
your neighbours name is Fritzy and ‘orphans’
keep being left at his door. You take the law
into your own hands and violently rape him.
Scorpio
You find that life as
a fat, impotent guy
is slightly boring.
The only erection
in your life is that
of your horny cat,
who seems to get more hot ass than you. You
begin to wonder how many bestiality-obsessed
girls are at Imperial and you have the best
idea. Cover yourself in fur, take some viagra
and jump out from the bushes at some girls.
Remember it’s not rape if you yell ‘surprise!’
Libra
You finish with his
elderly bodice and
run to the basement
and find, not an
imprisoned family
but an alternate
universe where everybody literally looks like
muppets. One of next year’s Sabbs looks like a
shrimp. There I said it, so what! You know it,
I know it, even he knows it. The question is,
what are we going to do about it?
Sagittarius
Oh yeh btw the
police and legal
system take a dim
view of rape. Oh I
didn’t mention, soz
dude. After 15 years
in prison you come out with a fresh outlook
on life, and a new motto too. ‘Dead girls can’t
say no’. 14 deaths later and you’ve made quite a
name for yourself. Teachers at school who said
you would never make it must be sorry now.
Well you’ve got them locked in your basement.
Capricorn
This week, OMGZ
THERES NO POLI-
TICS SECTION
THIS WEEK, gash-
balls. You hardly
even notice because
your interest in the outer world goes only as far
as “yeh man the slopes in the alps are bear safe.”
Speak like a normal person you posh fucking
twat. You might feel smug because you voted
Boris but deep inside I know you have no soul
Cancer
The building is
empty, apparently
everyone has gone
to heaven except
YOU. Oh and that
guy in the corridor.
Oh no it’s your paedophilic Uncle and he’s
touching himself, sigh. You’re stuck for
eternity with a guy who eyed you up as a child
with nothing to do but masturbate. To pass the
time you set upon him with a cheese grater.
Gemini
Hours later you
awake dazed with a
melon-sized lump
on your face, where
your nose used to
be. You stagger back
to your room to phone an ambulance, worried
that no-one found you or that they didn’t
bother to help. You pick up your mobile and
notice there’s no signal. In addition to all these
problems you look out the window and notice
that the apocalypse has come.
Leo
This week you
find out that being
pushed down a
flight of stairs isn’t
actually that bad.
You find yourself
flying across fields of gold like that time you
took crystal meth in lectures. But what’s that?
A blinding light – you hear faraway voices
telling you to come back. You flee the light,
return to life but find yourself completely
impotent as a result of your injuries, HA!
Taurus
Against all advice
and rational judge-
ment, you travel to
Austria. You eye up
all Austrian men as
possible abductors
and find your heart problem exacerbated as
you fail to find a calm moment. Against all
odds you make it home without been impris-
oned, raped or hacked to death by an axe,
but then your room-mate pushes you down a
flight of stairs.
Aries
This week it’s your
birthday but being a
sad, lonely fucker it
passes uneventfully.
Instead you dream
of gashing some ho
in the face when you realise “hey I’m being
really mysognistic and I’m actually ashamed”.
When you confide this to a female passer-by,
for a moment you connect with another soul,
but then you just gash her in the face anyway.
Pisces
Mountain Dew,
the most awesome
drink in the world.
Second only to the
triple-distilled urine
of your lecturer.
This week he notices you collecting his piss
in a bottle and slashes your grades. After
unsuccessfully pleading with him you decide
the only way to redeem yourself is through
an elaborate web of deceit and lies which lead
inevitably to the consumption of faeces.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week you
realise you can’t
be mates with the
guy across the hall
anymore. He has a
fucking motorbike,
leathers and a flat-top haircut. Anytime I come
within a hundred miles of him, I look like a
douche-fag by comparison. Yeh I watch Pow-
erthirst, GODBERRY! KING OF THE JUICE.
So we’re buds now? Wanna go on holiday?
You’ve got one booked already? Cunt.

Needy McNeedy: blazing-up London since 1666
I
f you have agony, you might
want to get it checked out by
the professionals. Needy Mc-
Needy specialises in “beating
some sense into those who need
it”, with a diploma in those hugs that
make you feel all warm and fuzzy in-
side (she’d refer to herself as “cuddly”
in a personal ad and everyone knows
that means fat). To check these quali-
fications, email her on agony.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I had my first exam the other day, and
I was so stressed trying to remember
everything I needed to know. It was
such a relief to finally get in the exam
hall and let it all out that I got a huge
erection. In the exam! I’m pretty sure I
wasn’t really turned on by the paper or
anything, just I felt a rush of relief and
then I got quite hard. It was so embar-
rassing and completely put me off the
exam, I wasted a lot of time thinking
of unsexy things (like maths) trying to
relax. How can I stop this from hap-
pening again?
FreakedOut
Dear FreakedOut
Everyone has embarrassing fetishes:
I once had a friend who made special
journeys into college at night just to
smell the Rector’s chair for a while. Once
he even left him a packet of mints. But,
seriously, exams? You need counselling.
You could try popping into the toilets
outside the Great Hall and knocking
one out before the exam just to reduce
the fervour of the excitement, or even do
it in the exam if you can be quick and
discrete, although please try not to get
shpaff on your exam paper, because I’ve
asked some lecturers and the general
consensus is that it’s probably not a de-
sirable bribe for good marks.

Dear Needy McNeedy,
My flatmate has recently started a rela-
tionship with a girl in a flat nearby. All
of us in the two flats get on really well
with each other, but my problem is that
they seem to like separating themselves
off thinking that we don’t know what is
going on. How do I get them to inte-
grate back as I just want to tell them
that we all know what is going on?
Anon.
Dear Anon.
This situation requires one of my all-
time favourite things: a party! Throw
a party in either flat, invite all your
friends (I await my email invite eagerly,
not that I won’t already have something
better to do that evening.), make some
jugs of extremely strong Pimms and
wait… either until you “discover” them
at it in the airing cupboard or you’re so
intoxicated that you don’t care about
asking them why they don’t just get it all
out in the open if they’re going to make
it so bloody obvious.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I get the worst hangovers ever. It’s now
summer party season, and I seriously
can’t cope with lying in bed all day after
a single glass of dry white at every bar-
beque I attend. I like to go out a lot but
I’ve got a project to do which means I
need to be in college every day. It’s not
like I even drink that much the night
before! What’s your advice for curing
the most awful hangovers?
PartyGirl
Dear PartyGirl,
Us party animals must stick together!
Some people swear by drinking a bot-
tle of champers in the bath before bed,
although I’ve never tried it so this one
comes without the Needy guarantee. I
find chilled Lucozade Sport is a must
(get the bottle that you can tip upside
down without spilling so you can lie
semi supine and still drink), but the ab-
solute best cure for a hangover is slow
sex: the endorphins with quell even the
most potent headache. You need to find
someone who will ignore your hangover
musk and doesn’t mind getting a bit
fresh the morning after.
Needy xxx
[Dear Reader,
I would like to point out that
the second problem in last
week’s column was a hoax,
probably planted by the maniac
from the horoscopes section.
If you have any real finance
related questions, sod off to an
investment bank seminar.
