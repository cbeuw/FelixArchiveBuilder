Concerns have been raised this week
by a Felix reader over the misleading
use of Imperial College’s name by sev-
eral alternative medical organisations.
The Centre for Homeopathic Edu-
cation was incorrectly listed as being
based at Imperial College London by
several websites, including worldho-
meopathy.org and worldhealthnow.
com. The address given, however, is in
Islington, a part of London where no
Imperial College sites exist.
Further confusion was caused as sev-
eral homeopaths cited Imperial Col-
lege London as the institution at which
they studied homeopathy. The Bi-Aura
foundation said of honorary member
Jayney Goddard: “[she] studied for over
five years at Imperial College.” With no
record of Jayney Goddard gaining a
degree at Imperial College, these com-
ments are questionable at best.
In an email to Imperial College alum-
nus Simon Singh, she later clarified her
relation to the College, saying that “my
homeopathy college was only based
there at the time”. However, these com-
ments are equally misleading.
In the past, the Centre for Homeo-
pathic Education has booked rooms
for classes on Imperial campus, al-
lowing their graduates to misleadingly
(though semantically accurately) claim
to have studied ‘at’ Imperial College.
The London College of Clinical
Hypnosis (LCCH) is guilty of a similar
offence. The LCCH runs a weekly Di-
ploma Course in the Skempton Build-
ing; with this week’s lessons scheduled
for Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th at
10:00am in Lecture Theatre 201.
College has contacted the homeo-
pathic sites that were claiming to be
based at Imperial College and they
have agreed to cease using Imperial
College’s name. The LCCH, however,
has not yet changed its information
with many Clincial Hypnotists cit-
ing Imperial College as their place of
study. This incident raises questions
about who can book rooms at Imperial
College and how efficiently the College
safeguards the Imperial brand.
In the meantime, however, if you’re
fed up with Geology or MechEng, for
a measly £2,500 you could have a Di-
ploma in Clinical Hypnosis, ‘from Im-
perial College.’

NSS rigging undermines
credibility of league tables
An audio recording that discredits the
validity of the National Student Survey
(NSS) has been made publicly available
on the Internet. The recording first
came to light on a website aiming to
reveal supposed truths about Kingston
University’s lack of ethics and below-
average teaching.
The Survey is sent by post or email
to final year undergraduates in the UK
and aims to be a feedback tool, meas-
uring the quality of a course from un-
dergraduates’ points of view. Theoreti-
cally, this anonymous poll is meant to
be an accurate barometer of a student’s
opinions regarding his or her course.
The recording on the protest website,
however, comes as somewhat of a blow
to the credibility of results gathered. In
the recording, Dr Fiona Barlow-Brown
of the university is heard blatantly try-
ing to influence the students through
a sly form of intimidation. The lecture
makes mention that these surveys
“feed in” to league tables and rankings.
Should Kingston be poorly placed in
national league tables, employers will
be led to believe students’ degrees
are “shit” rendering them essentially
unemployable.
As a result of this, students are told
to artificially inflate the scores for each
of the twenty-two questions posed.
“... If you think something was a 4, my
encouragement would be, give it a 5”,
says the Kingston academic to a lec-
ture room full of students. In response
to national media coverage of the inci-
dent, the university’s Vice-Chancellor
has called this an “isolated incident”
and that the lecturer’s comments were
“inappropriate”.
The story was picked up by IC news
website, Live! (live.cgcu.net) and
subsequently by the BBC, The Daily
Telegraph and The Times. This has
prompted an escalating number of
comments being sent in to a variety of
news websites and publications. Ac-
cording to the BBC Education website,
students across the country have come
forward to tell their tales of how their
own universities have been employing
similar conniving tactics in order to ul-
timately increase their standing.
TheNSSsurveysareheavilyweighted
in both the Guardian’s and The Times’
league tables. As a result, universities
who do not less-than-amicably ‘force’
their students to give glowing reports
of their teaching will invariably be
pushed down the rankings. For the
past decade, Imperial has consistently
been in the top three or four in the
country. In this year’s Guardian rank-
ings Imperial placed in sixth behind
the usual suspects, but also Warwick
and St Andrews.
It is unclear whether this catastro-
phe will impact assessments for future
league tables. Hopefully the authors
will take this opportunity to review
their criteria and restore confidence in
the rankings.

An apology to the RCSU
In recent issues, Felix was under the impression that “RCSU” had
been dropped from the Science Challenge title. This was a misunder-
standing and we would like to clarify that the Science Challenge is still
the “RCSU Science Challenge,” organised by the RCSU committee.
