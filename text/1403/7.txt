Some whine to go with your drivel?
H
ave you noticed how
whiny some of us are
when it comes to this
time of year? I don’t
want to place myself too
squarely in any particular examina-
tion schedules, because as all members
of the Football Cl- sorry, Imperial –
know, anonymity is what I get off on in
my sweaty Summer evenings alone in
my geeky hole.
I won’t bait any more, as the Editor
would presumably like a week where
he doesn’t have some kind of humour-
less babbling idiot writing in about
discrimination. But the whining arses
– not you, Phil Meier, you’re more like
a metronome attached to a cat’s tail –
babbling on about how the examina-
tions work, or the landlord’s treatment
of them, or how difficult it is to choose
between the Azores and Honolulu for
a Summer getaway; well, they’re all re-
ally starting to grate.
I know I’ve mentioned things like Fa-
cebook before, but this goes way, way
beyond that. It’s not just that a lot of
you seem to think the world owes you
a little bit, it’s that you genuinely, re-
ally think the world owes you some-
thing tangible, in an entirely serious
way. Particularly – and I know this is
like putting a dead horse onto a cir-
cular conveyor belt onto which whips
have been attached – the medics. It
has to be said, the further you progress
into a medical degree, the more you
lose touch with the reality of what the
world is like.
Grab a seat in a café or restaurant in
South Kensington, and if you’re lucky
you’ll find a group of students. A typi-
cal conversation will start off in a fairly
mundane way, normally updating – in
a quite funny parallel to Facebook –
one of the parties to the goings-on of
the other, normally involving someone
called Mary. I don’t know whether it’s
the same Mary; but if it is, she’s a bit of
a slut. But eventually, inevitably, we’ll
reach something that’s controversial.
I have to say, at this point, that those
of you undergoing exams presumably
do have genuine cases occasionally.
I’m sure there are times when mistakes
are made, but most of the time there
isn’t really much to complain about.
I’ve heard it all. The exams didn’t fol-
low your line of guesswork. The exams
tested you on something he’d men-
tioned in lectures but you were sure
he’d hinted you wouldn’t need. The ex-
ams included something that would’ve
taken ages to revise, and really, in this
day and age, how is that fair anyway?
Orifyou’reagirl,maybethere’ssome-
thing inherently unfair about some
other woman on your course? That’s a
favourite too. Good lord, if even half of
the stories I hear spewed out across the
JCR are true then Imperial not only has
a much higher proportion of females
than I originally thought but they all
appear to be conniving, backstabbing,
daughters of bastards. Sally invited you
around for a drink just after breaking
up with your best friend’s cousin, but
just before asking you if you wanted to
go to Chelsea Flower Show with her?
What a shit!
In fact in that sense, students today
seem even more active than they were
twenty years ago, and society appears
to have more restrictions and prob-
lems than even Jane Austen managed
to cough up onto her manuscripts.
People did this, but didn’t do that, or
did it wrong, or did it at a bad time, or
did it with the wrong body part, and
it was totally out of line, do you know
what I mean?
No. I don’t know what you mean. In
fact, I couldn’t give a toss: which only
serves to increase my smugness as I
suck down a cup of Starbucks Soul De-
stroyer and listen on.
But it doesn’t stop. The guys will
generally talk about more bizarre stuff
than the girls. Admittedly, the girls
don’t make a lot of sense but that could
just be because I’m not one of them,
but the guys are just way beyond that. I
can’t work out if they’re just very open
about their lives or flagrantly making
shit up, but the other day I sat and lis-
tened to one recount a drug-addict ex-
but-not-ex-you-know-right-girlfriend
he’d recently taken to sex therapy after
she’d hit him with a bottle of alcohol
during intercourse.
And this was a genuine complaint,
delivered with all the enthusiasm and
anger of myself at the fish counter in
Sainsbury’s enquiring as to why there
wasn’t any plaice in stock.
What is wrong with you people?
According to the media and People
Older Than Lecturers, the youth is a
hive mind of rapping, apathetic shits,
and whilst one out of three isn’t bad it
still does raise questions about what it
is you’re doing with your spare time.
You’re anything but apathetic, but
you’re firing off in every direction at
once with such ridiculous criticisms
that either you’re wishing you actually
had something worth whining about
– and you know who you are, you
self-indulgent tits – or you genuinely
think that things like the fact that you
need to revise more than one subject
at once or how the price of nice things
increases with time, are actually worth
complaining about.
Which is probably why people like
Phil Meier exist. So think of it this way,
Phil – my being anonymous means
that I can be whoever you want me to
be, baby. Just fire away with the criti-
cisms and I’ll lap them up.

Page 7: My continued degrading emas-
culation by Tim Dowling. Tim Dowling
bemoans his daily moral turpitude due
to his existence as a middle-class, mid-
dle-age married father of two whose
only job in life is to get up and bemoan
his daily moral turpitude due to his
existence as a middle-class, middle-
age married father of two. He leads us
to conclude that if everyone else were
like him then natural selection would
surely cause the extinction of the hu-
man race. He is immensely smug about
his gross incapacity.
Page 9: Life as a sufferer of Down's-
syndrome trapped in a feminist's body
by Lucy Mangan. Mangan explains in
lurid, tedious detail that she finds all
aspects of life frightening. She rolls
out yet another report of her infeasibly
witty conversations with her partner.
Essentially she moans about her cool,
sassy life in lieu of telling us how im-
mensely smug she is about all aspects
of her cool, sassy life.
Page 11: An interview with someone
with a 'personality' who, when asked
the question, 'When were you happi-
est?' will invariably resort to the smug
response 'When I got up this morning.'
which warms the cockles of the read-
er's heart.
Page 12: How to … write a 'How to …
[blank]' column by Guy Browning. In a
series of deft forays into post-modern-
ism the witty yet eloquent author dis-
appears completely up his own arse.
Page 14: An Experience. The left-wing
middle-class answer to watching Rikki
Reduced Guardian weekend magazine
Lake, a person who wishes they had
more money relates some experience
associated to having too little money
or in some cases limbs. The reader is
invited to weep where he or she finds
himself or herself unspeakably moved.
Page 16: Letters. Pertinent questions
are posed by extremely eloquent, witty
and socially-conscious Guardian read-
ers regarding the Weekend supple-
ment's lack of circumspection or inat-
tention to detail. All the points raised
are extraordinarily valid and impor-
tant. For instance, contributions are
made to the lengthy debate on the true
origins of the omelette.
Pages 20-30: What People In The Real
World Are Actually Like. The Weekend
sends out a witty, socially-conscious
reporter with a photographer to tell
the stories through words and photo-
graphs of actual real peasants living in
our very own British Isles. It comes to
the conclusion that they are all people
too and that a truly socially-conscious
Guardian reader should not think of
them as peasants (even if they must be
because they read the Daily Mail).
Pages 31-53: Fashion. Ugly people wear
ugly clothes so that uglier readers can
point and laugh at how their betters
have fallen.
Page 55: Beauty. Stuff made out of avo-
cado is applied to faces and reviewed.
Waitrose's organic guacamole gets five
stars.
Pages 56-60: My favourite organic
ingredient by The Reverend Hugh
Fearnley-Whittingstall. Hugh extols
the virtues of an organic ingredient
which he then stuffs inside another
organic ingredient or hollows out and
stuffs with other organic ingredients.
This week he tackles acorn-fed domes-
tic pets.
Page 61: Around Britain with thou-
sands of pounds in my wallet. An
ageing Bruce Willis writing under the
pseudonym of Matthew Fort spends
vast amounts of money on organic
food so we can learn how better to live.
He visits a free-range almond farm and
organic non-pareille caper orchard
and finds that the heady mix improves
one's longevity.

lobster and tells us how tiresome the
whole thing is.

pissed on Chateau Lafitte before felch-
ing her way through the sort of disgust-
ing Fairtrade filth that a penurious but
socially-conscious Guardian reader
might drink.
Page 69: Doctor, Doctor. Socially-con-
scious Guardian readers ask about how
to avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis on
their carbon-offset flights to Hawaii.

stand about men. The next three sec-
onds of the saga are unveiled.

scious Guardian readers ask about the
best way of storing Fairtrade things in
organic things or vice-versa.
