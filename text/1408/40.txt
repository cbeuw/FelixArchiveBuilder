You wouldn’t be laughing if you had invited us to the photoshoot. Actually you’d probably feel uncomfortable. Maybe I should wear trousers...
Shocking discovery in Felix office
It is no understatement to say that this
article has been a long time coming.
The Hangman investigative team has
been questioning and digging all year,
leaving no stone unturned in order to
bring this important expose to you the
reader. We have discovered systematic
doucheness pervading the Felix office
and a startling lack of concern about
the quality of conversation, company
kept or even basic hygiene. The entire
Felix staff are, to put it nicely, tools.
Obviously this is a controversial
claim to make and one would need a
large amount of evidence in order to
justify such a comment. Well I have
a large amount of evidence, the pa-
per trail is longer than my penis and
that’s saying something (if you want to
say something about my penis, please
email hangman. If you want to book
my penis to speak at your event, also
email hangman). Sorry, yes, the paper
trail. This Felix is proof of my claims.
I know you usually flick through Fe-
lix, searching desperately for the Hang-
man page, but if you stop and actually
read some of the stuff in the rest of this
newspaper: you’d be horrified. Lets be-
gin with News. Ok take a deep breath
and turn to the News pages. Back yet?
it’s ok, your safe again just relax, what
did you see? NUS referendum? Coun-
cil? Meaningless bullshit? Ah it’s that
Andrew Somerville character, he’s the
one dressed like Death’s goth cousin
on the right hand side of the picture.
Luckily he’s finished his barrel scrap-
ings of a degree and off to prostitute
himself to the real world; we won’t be
seeing him around anymore.
You don’t think dressing like a goth
makes you a tool? Ok, there’s more.
Turn to the politics, business or fash-
ion section. Back? Come on, stop shak-
ing, you’re back with hangman. Take
off those wet clothes and come sit
with me... More likely than not, there
isn’t even a politics, business or fash-
ion section this week. This is because
the section editors have realized that
nobody read anything they wrote. You

can see these tools in the centre of the
photo: Kadhim Shubber, Dan Wan and
Afonso Campos. Look at them having
fun... only tools have fun... tools and
communists.
The list goes on. The good-looking
Arts Editors, reclusive Music Editors,
barely breathing Nightlife Editor, Greg
Mead and the International Editor,
are all liars and cheats. The Arts Edi-
tors are all blind, the Music Editors are
deaf, the Nightlife Editor is allergic to
the dark and the International Editor...
well, he’s never even left the country.
I ask you, readers, how does Gilead
Amit know what’s going on in the rest
of the world? I suppose he has a crystal
ball... or more likely still... he makes it
up! I mean who’s even heard of a coun-
try called China? All intelligent people
know that china is the stuff you drink
Earl Grey out of... unless you’re poor
You might want to look through the
rest of the evidence we have presented
i.e. the newspaper you have in your
hands, but if you have a heart condi-
tion or even an iota of common sense,
you’ll stay on these two pages.
What are we trying to achieve by
exposing our colleagues with this self-
indulgent article? Some may argue that
we are unprofessional, spiteful... even,
dare I say, sex Gods. We have two
things to say to these people. 1. Shut up
and 2. Tell your mum to shut up too.
Notice anything missing from the
picture above? That’s right, the Hang-
man Editors aren’t in the picture.
Readers, we simply weren’t invited. We
have been suppressed and isolated for
too long and it’s time these so called
‘real Editors’ got retribution, or at least
lengthy prison sentences.
You must be wondering ‘how can I
help the Hangman team’? If you are a
sexy lady, come join the Felix team. If
you are a sexy man, stay away, it’s hard
enough to get into the Arts Editors’
pants without even more competi-
tion. Otherwise, phone up your local
American Embassy and ask for regime
change, aerial bombing and waffles.
Together we can make a change, we can
build a better future. We can save our
children from wankers. Yes we can, yes
we can ... yes we can (fade to black)
