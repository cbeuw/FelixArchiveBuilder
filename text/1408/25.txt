THE HISTORY OF
IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON, 1907–2007
Higher Education and Research in Science, Technology and Medicine
T
his is the first major history of Imperial College London. The book tells the story of a new type
of institution that came into being in 1907 with the federation of three older colleges. Imperial
College was founded by the state for advanced university-level training in science and technology,
and for the promotion of research in support of industry throughout the British Empire. True to its name
the college built a wide number of Imperial links and was an outward looking institution from the start.
Today, in the post-colonial world, it retains its outward-looking stance, both in its many international
research connections, and with staff and students from around the world. Connections to industry and
the state remain important. The College is one of Britain’s premier research and teaching institutions,
including now medicine alongside science and engineering. This book is an in-depth study of Imperial
College; it covers both governance and academic activity within the larger context of political, economic
and socio-cultural life in twentieth-century Britain.
