IC Squash Men’s 1st
Team of the Year
Imperial Squash Men’s 1st team have been on
superb form all season. Undefeated all year and
only dropping one game, the team comfortably
won their league and went on to win the BUSA
Shield, a national competition. Rather unsurpris-
ingly, they came top of the felix sports league with
a staggering 70 points, 19 points clear of second
place. Well done lads, let’s hope for a repeat per-
formance next season.
Netball 2nd
Best Medic Team
Out of all the medical teams, the Women’s Net-
ball 2nds team have stood head and shoulders
above the rest. Coming in at 9th place, which is
commendable in its own right, they are also 6
places clear from their closest competitor, the
women’s hockey team, and have performed well,
only losing two games. Let hope that next year it’s
none girls, and also write in to let us know how
the season is going.
Imperial Boat Club
Club of the Year
They love to point it out, year in year out, but it
is true, Imperials’ Boat Club do consistently per-
form and bring home the goods in the form of
BUSA points. Their contribution to the final
BUSA points count is the same as all the other
clubs put together, and for that reason alone, they
are this year Club of the Year. Hopefully next year
the club will continue in their success, both in and
out of the boat. Well done everyone!
Imperial College Hockey Club
Felix Sportsmanship
The Felix Sportsmanship Award is for the indi-
vidual, team or club who has conformed to the
proper spirt of their game on and off the pitch.
This year the Hockey Club has once again pro-
duced a successful calendar (they are still avail-
able online) and have dominated the union every
Wednesday night! With the introduction of a new
president and a range of successful social events
throughout the year the hockey club has made
the union proud!
Well here we are, the end of the season
and my last issue as Sport Editor. And
what better way than to have a round-
up of the year in the for of an awards
ceremony. The league table has been
running all season, and even though
people have come up to me from time
to time saying they don’t think the
table is as fair as it could be, which I
agree with, but since no-one offered a
reasonable alternative we’ve stuck with
it and it has ended up being a great
success. Next year, a new version will
be created which we think will be fairer
for all the teams involved.
So on to the awards. Most of the
decisions were based on the current
league table which meant that IC
Squash Men’s 1st team came on top.
Congratulations guys. We have some
t-shirts for you guys, please come to
the office to collect them. We then
move on to the best of the rest, both
male and female, and similarly for the
worst teams. There are a few teams
who, unfortunately, have not managed
to win a game all season in the BUSA
leagues, although I have assurances
that they faired better in the ULU
leagues. Hopefully next season will be
The winners are...
a better one for them all.
Lastly we have the club awards and
we start with Worst Club of the Year.
This award is purely awarded on the re-
sults that all the teams in the club have
achieved that season, and unfortunate-
ly for the medics rugby club, they came
bottom, although I imagine they can
take solace in the fact that they beat all
the IC rugby teams at Varsity this year,
again! At the other end of the table,
mainly due to the fact that the Squash
Men’s 1st were such convincing win-
ners in the team league table, meant
that the club as a whole did very well.
This is not taking anything away from
the other squash teams, as they also
performed well coming 11th, 20th and
26th. But the Club of the Year award
went to a club that has performed ex-
ceptionally well this season, IC Boat
Club, and hopefully it will continue to
do the same next year.
All that’s left for me to say is well
done to all the teams this year, it looks
as though it has been a tremendous
season for both Imperial and the Med-
icals, and I hope that you all continue
to send in your reports to next year’s
sports editors, Jack Cornish and Mus-
tapher Botchway. So this is it from me,
I’ll see you all next year and I hope you
will all enjoy Felix next year.

ACC Colours are awarded each year by the ACC Colours Commit-
tee, made up of the ACC Exec and the Sabbatical officers, to those
students who have demonstrated outstanding performance in Sport
during that year. The colours are given only to those who have shown
themselves to have performed at a level above that of their team-
mates, this may be through being clearly the best player in a team,
or if they have been chosen to represent a regional or national team
in their sport.
The honours list this year again reflects the exceptional talents we
have at Imperial College, and most importantly, those that represent
the union, and hence every one of us, against all the other universities
in the country. This always gives me a little kick when I see our rowers
stuffing Oxford and Cambridge, and I know that I’m a member of the
same Imperial College Union that they represent.
