News review of the year: 2007–08
After three terms and thirty issues of Felix, it’s time for this news reporting cat to head into hibernation. But
before we go, here’s a re-cap of the major, and some not so major, stories that have occupied this year’s Felix
T
he year began with Southside
opening its doors on time, al-
beit with rooms yet to be fully
completed. Furniture remained un-
packed; items and fittings were still
boxed; builders’ tools were found
lying in bedrooms; and lifts were
malfunctioning amongst a plethora
of other problems.
College recognised this as unac-
ceptable and offered a 25% discount
on rent to affected students, but only
for their first month. Students lucky
enough to find themselves with a
view of the Eastside builders’ porta-
cabins were offered a further £5 per
week discount for the entire year.
Many students were left outraged at
having to pay over £155.00 per week
for unfinished accommodation. De-
spite the initial criticisms, the halls
were still incomplete nine weeks later.
stoictv revealed Southside was still in a
shambolic state when it filmed on loca-
tion for its current affairs programme,
exposing unattached toilet seats, flood-
ing showers and door fixtures that fell
off when used.

the decline in satisfaction

mperial leapt from ninth to fifth
place in the Times Higher Edu-
cation Survey in 2007, trailing
behind Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford
and Yale. However, the rise came
only months after findings from the
2008 Good University Guide statis-
tics which placed Imperial at 68th in
the student satisfaction rankings.
In December Felix set out to dis-
cuss university satisfaction with
Imperial’s student body. Responses
were mixed: some students were
critical of the recreational facilities
offered at IC and also complained
aboutfeelingstressed,butmanywere
pleased with their university experi-
ence stating that they wouldn’t have
chosen anywhere else in hindsight.
One thing that everyone could
agree upon is that students at Impe-
rial are worked very hard!
Autumn term: October – December
I
n response to a number of
thefts from the Aeronautics
department, Felix decided to
investigate the building’s security.
Turnstiles were installed across
campus over the summer break,
replacing the security guards that
previously manned the entrances.
Felix tested their effectiveness us-
ing a number of methods such as
vaulting over the barriers, crawl-
ing underneath them and even
doing the ‘limbo.’
Despite doing this in full view of
a CCTV camera, and after wait-
ing for over an hour for a security
guard to show up, Felix got bored
and left the scene, free to prowl
where it likes.
T
he character of Imperial
students was brought into
question on two separate oc-
casions in the Autumn term, when
Felix received several complaints
about instances of questionable
behaviour.
In November, Felix received a let-
ter from an offended visitor to the
College, appalled at students’ lack
of consideration shown for their
surroundings. The arrival of the let-
ter coincided with the annual Royal
School of Mines Freshers’ Dinner
a.k.a. ‘The Most Notorious Night
of the Year,’ at which the RSM were
fined for damages and forced to
apologise after numerous damages,
a food fight, copious amounts of
vomit and a glass full of urine being
left for cleaners.
Imperial students’ lack of respect
was brought into question once
again towards the end of November
when members of the Football Club
were alleged to have chanted homo-
phobic phrases in the Union.

debate
re-opens
W
ith the 2009 Top-up
Fees review edging
closer and closer, ICU
took steps to revise its stance on
the Higher Education funding
debate.
After months of debate, policy
revisions and a survey of the stu-
dent body, the Union eventu-
ally formulated its new policy in
March 2008.
The new policy, formed on the
basis of the opinions of 440 IC stu-
dents, resolved to support keeping
Top-up Fees at £3,000; to oppose
an increase in the cap; to oppose
marketisation of Higher Educa-
tion; and to oppose Graduate Tax.
I
n November Felix reported on
the government’s plans to in-
troduce a draconian monitoring
system to keep tabs on the number
of days overseas students are absent
for from their courses.
According to Tier 4 of the Home
Office’s “Point Based System,” which
is due to become active in early 2009,
overseas students who are absent for
more than 14 days must be reported
to the government. Failure to do so
could potentially leave both the stu-
dent and the university in hot water.
The measures are part of the gov-
ernments attempts to combat ter-
rorism issues in education, however
the plans have faced widespread
criticism for potentially “falling foul
of the Race Relations Act.”
