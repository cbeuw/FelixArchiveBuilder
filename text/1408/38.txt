urprise, surprise. It’s the last
issue of the year, and what
better way to celebrate the
end of exams and the dawn-
ing of summer than by at-
tempting another blockbuster cross-
word? If you can’t think of one, seek
help.
Apologies for the mix-up with the
answers last week – the solutions to
both Crossword 1406 and 1407 are
printed on the right – hopefully cor-
rectly. The joint winners of last week’s
crossword were Benjamin Martin
and Lucy Bricheno. Congratulations
to you, and may I take this opportunity
to thank everyone who sent in, solved,
tried to solve or looked at one of my
crosswords this year. I will probably
spend most of the summer in therapy,
learning to stop screaming at the sight
of black and white.
One final request, if I may. As this
is my first year setting cryptic cross-
words, I would dearly like to know
what all you little people in public-land
thought of my efforts. Good, bad, easy,
difficult, challenging, interesting, re-
petitive...make up your own adjectives
and send in a comment. Please.
May you all spend the summer in the
most enjoyable ways imaginable.
