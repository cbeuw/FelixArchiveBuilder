Games
Games Editors – Azfarul Islam and Sebastian Nordgren

P
hew. So the year’s finally
over and what a rollercoast-
er ride it’s been! Things got
so hectic with the Summer
Term that I had take a prop-
er hiatus from the section altogether. I
offer my apologies to the readers and
to anyone who enjoyed going through
the Games pages.
It’s only appropriate that this last is-
sue under the stewardship of Tomo
gets to have the Games section dedi-
cated to the one and only Metal Gear
Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The game
represents the end of an era that has
left a permanent mark on the world
of videogames and one whose praises
shall be sung everywhere. While smok-
ing. And taking down giant bipedal
machines of mass destruction.
Normally, this editorial section is the
hardest bit to write but the irony now
is that there’s so much to be said yet so
little space to say it in. However, there’s
no harm in trying.
From a gaming perspective, the
2007-08 session has been a pretty
amazing one, witnessing the release of
a cavalcade of games that simply blow
everything out of the water. There
are too many names to list but you all
know who these lovely chaps are any-
way. Who knows what the 2008-09 ses-
sion will bring us, but there are some
pleasant surprises and true gems in
the horizon. But enough about games,
there are more important things to be
said here!
Firstly, it’s been absolutely amazing
to work for Felix this year and I can’t
thank Tomo enough for his encourage-
ment, guidance, patience and the Thai
noodles he’d get from Tesco. Running
the Games section has been crazy (in
a good way) and I’m really glad that so
many of you, the readers, responded
so positively to it. I mean, seriously, it
really makes all that hard work utterly,
utterly worth it in the end. So a really
big round of thanks goes out to all of
the readers for their comments, and to
Edu and Dave of the IC Gaming Club
as well as the members.
Personal thanks and lotsa love go out
to all the lovely people who contributed
to Felix Games: Alex Stubley, Andrew
Lim, Andrew Lyle, Andrew Somerville,
Angry Geek, Chris Hutchison, David
Lawrence, Derek Chow, James Finner-
ty, James Porter, Jen Strangeways, Mike
Cook, Robin George Andrews, fellow
Editor Sebastian Nordgren, Tom Rob-
erts, Viral Shah and Wing Hym Liu. If
there’s any other name that I haven’t
mentioned then I offer my deepest
apologies. You may send Howlers to
the usual address at games.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk.
A big round of hugs are there for the
Felix team this year who were a bunch
of awesome people, both professional-
ly and personally. I hope all of you guys
continue at Felix!
Here’s hoping to a fantastic new ver-
sion of Felix next year under the lead-
ership of one Jovan “Jov” Nedic and I
hope that Felix Games can take over
the entire paper, erm, continues to be
read and loved by all.
Solid Snake, Legendary
Azfarul Islam witnesses the end of an era that helped change gaming
I
t has be confessed that I ap-
proached this article with a
great deal of trepidation. On
one hand, I love the Metal Gear
Solid series which means that
bias could easily creep into the text.
Similarly, the last time I played an MGS
game was roughly four years ago with
the third iteration. I was worried that a
combination of time and having been
exposed to the multitude of incredible
games in between may cause me to
look at the slightly sillier aspects of the
series with distaste. And on top of that,
the expectations levelled on this game
were astronomical. Just for starters.
However, all this mattered little once
the ending credits rolled on buoyed by
soothing versions of the main orches-
tral themes of Metal Gear’s past.
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Pa-
triots sees you plunged into a world
where war and conflict are routine;
they have transformed from something
abhorrentintoa
full-fledged
economy.
Private
Mili-
tary
Companies or PMCs have become the
corporations of this dystopian future;
children now grow up wanting to fight
toearnincome.Rebelfactionsthrough-
out the world offer the resistive forces
the PMCs need to keep themselves in
business. On top of this is an underly-
ing system centred on nanomachine
technology that keeps everything in
check. Certainly, the very concept of
war has changed. It’s into one of these
many battles that the series’ hero Solid
Snake is inserted. However, something
is amiss.
The man is prone to fits of cough-
ing and seizures. His hardened arteries
pump the remnants of the deadly virus
FOXDIE. His weary muscles ache and
need to be supported by an enhancing
body suit. And his greyed hair reveals a
shocking change from the legend we’ve
all come to know and love. This is no
longer the story we’ve come to expect;
this is the story of Old Snake.
Sneaking in amidst a convoy of free-
dom fighters, Snake is on a very differ-
ent mission to his makeshift comrades.
They seek to fight whereas he seeks to
end it all. Under fire from the well-po-
sitioned PMC troops, Snake is forced
to leave the vehicle and continue on
foot. And this is where you come in.
The cinematic cam-
era follows Snake
as he ducks be-
hind cover
and ever so
subtly,
control is
givento
the player. This is only where the game
just begins to shine.
One of the first things that series’
veterans will notice is that their well-
worn control niches don’t give you the
reactions they would expect. A few
taps here, perhaps following by a last-
ing depression or two, reveals that even
the controls have finally embraced a
more streamlined generation as with
most current titles. The tiniest hint of
disappointment at change slowly tran-
sitions to wonder as Snake’s moveset
slowly showcases a gleefully large va-
riety of motions and smooth, intuitive
machinations.
Now content, your intense focus on
the controller shifts and suddenly the
muffled sound created by your own
distraction comes into sharp focus. Sol-
diers yell indiscriminately and guns rat-
tle, all in the name of the war economy,
and you can even pick the combatants
give each other orders, encouragement
and shout for help. Suddenly, you feel
Snake’s age set in. And it’s not because
he’s just reached to rub his aching
lower back. The conflict has escalated
from the few-on-one encounters of the
past and has taken a mind of its own;
whether or not you wish to be part of
the madness will always depend on you
as the game progresses. It’s a bloody
battlefield out there, but you can’t help
but be awestruck at this assault on the
senses. And you know what? Squint at
it just a bit. No, really do it. See that?
That won’t be the first time your jaw
drops and bounces down the stairs and
rolls onto the road outside.
Seriously speaking,
I’ve come to accept
generally sharp and
shiny visuals to
be the norm for
this generation;
it’s only fair
for the high
cost invest-
ment that all parties involved are mak-
ing. However, I would be an utter fool
to not admit that Metal Gear Solid 4
made me speechless on more than one
occasion. There were moments when
you can’t help but ask yourself: “Surely
that was real? Surely that wasn’t real-
time?” Yeah, there are some pretty ugly
textures scattered around that disap-
point but as for everything framing
these bits, well, the comparison seems
astronomical.
Spread over five acts, Metal Gear
Solid 4 sends Solid Snake and his
friends, new and old, travelling across
the world with one goal in mind: to
stop the freakish amalgamation of
former personalities Liquid Snake and
Revolver Ocelot. Alone they were far
more formidable than most villains but
as one being their sheer aura exudes
something that’s rather holistic, in a
deliciously evil way. This is a plot that
is a true culmination of everything that
makes Metal Gear the benchmark for
interactive storytelling. There are char-
acters you genuinely feel for, events that
astound and come shockingly close to
real life and plot twists that build their
way into grand schemes which inspire
both awe and fear. There’s a significant
improvement in the quality of the writ-
ing and dialogue as well. Still as emo-
tive and heartfelt, the hamfisted nature
of past titles have been toned down by
a large degree.
And what a set of acts this was.
Fighting through dust-choked bat-
tlefields where the conflict between
finance and freedom never ends. En-
tering the jungles once again to use
the land itself in your favour. Bedecked
in a stylish trenchcoat, tailing a man
through a city under curfew and where
frequent patrols threaten to send you
to the chopping block. And then, going
back to where it all began...
Now, I was always expecting the tale
to be of epic proportions, as with any
