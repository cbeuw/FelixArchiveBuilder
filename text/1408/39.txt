Disgraced Felix Editor tells Union:
“Fire me? You can’t fire me! I quit!”
T
he current Felix Editor’s
ego suffered a severe blow
when he heard that he
would have to give up his
mediocre job turning the
gears that provide power to the Beit
complex. When told that he was to
be replaced with the main electricity
grid; Tom Roberts let out a wailing cry
of disappointment, much like Chewy.
Tom Roberts, known to all three of his
acquaintances as Tomo, was formally
accused by the union as being a giant
douche. The union went on to state
“Tom Roberts is a black spot in today’s
white sheet society,” and “he should
be hung, drawn and raped for the war
crimes commited against the children
of Siberia.”
Tomo was officially fired from his
duty as undergound gremlin as soon
as the union found out the children
of Siberia were being abducted by To-
mo’s elite private army, known as the
“Urban Terror Strike Force. (UTSF)”
Once abducted, the children were sub-
ject to hideous genetic experiments,
transforming them into mutant Felix
contributors.
As a result of his deserved dismissal,
this issue was produced entirely by a
couple of six year-olds in a Cambo-
dian sweat shop, earning so little they
might as well be working in the ICU
bar. When presented with the claims,
Step, the college’s enforcer of the silly
law that prevents Imperial’s staff, stu-
dents and departments from getting
involved with illegal exploitation of
children, said that he “would eat those
goddamn babies”
Roberts was seen being dragged
from Beit Quad screaming “I WASN’T
FIRED! IT WAS THE END OF MY
CONTRACT. THE END MAN!”
Heavy flOw = awesome Giggidy goo
A
n Imperial student has
brought legal action
against the Hangman
Team after we pub-
lished a photo of her
and then suggested that we dou-
ble-teamed her. Out of court nego-
tiations broke down after one of the
Hangman Editors decided it would
be OK to re-enact the alleged events
using a Pepsi Bottle, trumpet and his
own impressive appendage. We stick
by our comments and are confident
that the court will recognise our
right to demean and fantasise about
hot members of the opposite sex.
R
esearchers at Impe-
rial have made a break-
through in our under-
standing of how life
began in the primordial
soup that is my momma’s sweet pota-
to pie. In a case of serendipitous for-
tune, the team discovered a game for
the Playstation 3 that explains every-
thing. Chief Researcher Plumping-
don Dolty had this to say “Put down
your Bibles, we have the answers”.
The Hangman posse (yeh that’s right
we is from the street... Kensington
High Street... blud) decided to jack a
PS3 and get our geek on.
You play as a tiny organism in the
sea of life, eating food to get stronger,
attacking other creatures to assert
dominance with ambient music and
glowing lights helping you along the
way. However the best part of flOw
reveals itself when you’re high and I
mean “Damn that burger looks sexy”
off-your-face high. We recommend a
bag of crystal meth, then some crack
followed by some giggidy goo. Felix
does not condone drug use. Drugs
damage your brain and and restrict
your functions - seriously, this article
would be so much easier to write if that
unicorn would get off my keyboard.
The icing on top of this gaming cake
is the fact that you control your snake-
like monster (oh man so many jokes)
by tilting the controller. Cancel that
holiday to Havana, shut your curtains
and get into some seriously heavy
flOw... all right.

restrictions
on Ashley
Brown
H
as Ashley Brown stolen
your girlfriend/boy-
friend? Did he steal your
job? Do your friends like
him more than they like
you? Don’t feel too bad, he is the great-
est person on the planet.
During his time at Imperial he has re-
vitalized Live!, selflessly served Guilds
and been an all round helpful chap; at
the same time as getting a few degrees
(well if you call a 2:2 a degree...).
His startling potential has been kept
in check during his time at this insti-
tution, though as he ventures into the
real world, the government has de-
cided to take preventive action. There
are worries about what might happen
if Ashley Brown falls into the wrong
hands. A senior cabinet minister spoke
to Hangman: “we’ve got credible intel
that tells us that terrorist organisations
are seeking to get their hands on Mr
Brown, codenamed: “The Dude”. With
him on board, their websites would be
truly awesome, they’d have embedded
video and everything. Britain is facing
annihilation if we don’t keep a lid on
the Dude.”
Measures currently in place in-
clude 24 hour surveillance, armed
guards and free ice cream whenever
he wants it.
Hangman tried to get in contact
with Ashley Brown; unfortunately
he was busy. Apparently it takes up
quite a bit of time appearing on Op-
rah, starring in blockbuster films,
writing your autobiography and tak-
ing over the world. Good luck Ash-
ley Brown, we are forever basking in
your reflected glory.
Beautiful, beautiful flOw
Simply horrific
