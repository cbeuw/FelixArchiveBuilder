Spring term: January – March
T
he editorial freedom of Felix
was called into question in
February when it was pre-
vented from publishing three sto-
ries. The articles were deemed to be
in violation of the Staff Student Pro-
tocol (SSP) and Election regulations.
In response Felix printed a ‘no news’
style front cover and news section,
explaining the situation and declar-
ing “the cat is not free”.
Since then efforts have been made
in order to change and clarify the
SSP and election regulation. Propos-
als made to council by Felix Editor,
Tom Roberts, and Live! Editor, Ash-
ley Brown, have had mixed results.
Election regulations remain as they
were, however, Council accepted
changes to the SSP, which are being
reviewed by the Trustee Board be-
fore finally going for approval with
the College. If the Trustee Board
accepts the changes, it doesn’t end
there however, since College must
also approve the correction. The
case continues…
A truly free press?
T
he Political Philosophy Soci-
ety (PPS) held its first week
long ‘Conflict Case Study
Week’ kicking off with an academic
study of the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict. However a last minute com-
plaint and threat to pull out from
participant Professor David New-
man caused the PPS to switch pan-
ellist Dr Azzam Tamimi for Ghada
Karmi to allow the event to continue
with all sides being represented.
But this caused its own flurry of
new problems with the organisers
receiving angry calls and emails from
members of the public, furious at the
PPS for bowing to ‘Zionist pressure’
while also being criticised for limit-
ing Freedom of Speech.
Israeli publications such as the Je-
rusalem Post and the Jewish Chroni-
cle took a different stance, reporting
the PPS as a controversial society
that is comfortable with hosting
panellists of an extremist ideology.
As a result, PPS Chairman, Ammar
Waraich, issued a statement in which
he asserted the PPS’s right to choose
panellists freely in the society’s pur-
suit of a free and fair exchange of
ideas, the disappointment of what he
termed the “hasty” reporting by the
Jewish media and the PPS’s decision
to re-invite Dr Tamimi for a future
debate.
Eventually the debate went ahead,
with thorough discussion and a high
turnout.
PPS event borders on crisis
2
008 started with the official an-
nouncement that Phase Two
of the Beit Masterplan had
been given the green light. The Un-
ion finally secured a total of £3.32m
from College, the IC and Harlington
Trusts, reclaimed VAT and left over
money from the ‘successful’ first
phase.
The redevelopment will eventually
lead to a completely revamped Stu-
dent Activities Centre located on the
second floor mezzanine of the Un-
ion building. A new gym will be in-
stalled on the third floor and the Un-
ion meeting rooms will be relocated
to the East Basement. Final improve-
ments will be made to overhaul the
archaic electrical and mechanical in-
frastructure, plus energy efficiency
measures have also been promised
in the way of extra insulation, light-
ing control and double glazing.
Unwritten College laws say that
initial projections of any redevelop-
ment at Imperial will never materi-
alise on time, and Phase Two is no
exception. Work was originally due
to commence in March, but the Un-
ion has since postponed these plans
to the start of the new academic year
in September.
Felix will be taking bets in October
on what the first disruption to the
redevelopment will be.
Beit finally gets go-ahead
N
ews of more building project
delays broke in January
when it was revealed by Fe-
lix that the ground floor of the Li-
brary would be opening 4 months
later than planned.
Felix spoke to a senior member of
the College’s Building Projects team
who requested to remain anony-
mous. He described the set back as
a “procurement issue,” meaning that
dimensions drawn up in plans dif-
fered from those of the actual con-
struction site.
The Library Redevelopment’s
Project Leader described the delay
as “disappointing, but building work
doesn’t always go to plan.”
With the works running into the
summer months, many students us-
ing the library to revise for exams
were subject to not just construction
noise, but also the constantly Hellish
temperatures on the upper levels of
the Library. However, despite over
£10m having been spent on the Li-
brary’s entire refurbishment, a solu-
tion for the sub-tropical tempera-
tures has yet to be announced, with
only air conditioning for the ground
and third floors included in the cur-
rent redevelopment.
That’s another reason for students
to look forward to the end of exam
time then...
Library refurbishment stalls
A
s Ethos celebrated its sec-
ond birthday, College stat-
ed that plans for its third
year did not include the introduc-
tion of membership fees for stu-
dents. Whilst Ethos Centre Man-
ager, Ian Reid proclaimed a “great
year”, fears surfaced that Ethos
would follow suit of other Lon-
don student sports facilities and
charge a regular fee for gym use.
However, only further integration
into Imperial’s South Kensington
campus was on the agenda for the
new year ahead including greater
interaction with IC sports teams
and increased communication
with students about health and
fitness.
Ethos to
remain free
C
oncerns over College’s refus-
al to grant full-time student
status to PhD students in
their writing-up period were raised
in March after the Camden Council
took Matthew Yong to court over
unpaid Council Tax.
Under government legislation,
students are defined as those attend-
ing a course which lasts more than
one year, for more than 24 weeks per
year in which more than 21 hours of
work are completed per week. Mat-
thew Yong felt that he fit this defini-
tion and so with the support of ICU,
his supervisors and local Conserva-
tive councillor Chris Philp – but not
the support of the college – he took
his battle to the courts.
At the eleventh hour, outside the
courtroom, Mr Yong was told by
Camden Council that they were
dropping the legal action and he was
issued a summons withdrawal no-
tice, declaring the Council’s inten-
tion to drop the case.
However, since then, Matthew
Yong has become caught in a legal
limbo. The council has not, in fact,
retracted their Council Tax claim
but equally, they haven’t taken Mr
Yong back to court.
In the meantime College is review-
ing its policy on writing-up students,
and since Mr Yong’s almost-court
appearance, IC has said it will “sup-
ports” the idea of writing up students
gaining tax exemption in the future.
Writing-up roundabout
Sabb-elects + pies = laughs
And in
other
news...
Posters from the anti-
Scientology group,
Anonymous, popped up
on notice boards across
campus culminating in Felix
reporting on a massive
demonstration outside the
CoS’ headquarters.
This year’s RCSU Science
Challlenge was another
resounding success
Concerned students from
Silwood campus contacted
Felix after stumbling upon
a greenhouse containing a
radioactively contaminated
plant
Felix landed Chris Larvin,
in a spot of bother with the
Environmental Society. We’re
sorry Chris, that was rotten :-(
D
ays after winning this year’s
Sabbatical Elections, the in-
coming Presidents and Felix
Editor faced their first test: how well
they could take a pie to the face.
Felix organised a ‘photo shoot’
under the pretense that the pictures
of the winning candidates would be
appearing on the front cover of the
next issue.
This wasn’t a complete lie, how-
ever, as three of the five Sabb-elects
did end up on the front cover, albeit
covered in shaving foam standing
alongside a giant ape belonging to
the C&G Hit Squad, who carried out
the pieing.
The remaining two winners were
relegated to the inside pages of Fe-
lix, however they didn’t manage to
escape their soapy fates either.
This publication’s Editor has al-
ready booked his holidays for next
year, funnily enough around the
months of February and March...
