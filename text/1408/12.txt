Let’s talk about drugs
H
ooray! Exams are over
and the season to wreak
havoc is upon us. As I
write this I still have a
considerable amount of
revision to get done before next week,
but that should not taint the subject
of my comment! I am in surprisingly
good spirits despite everyone around
me celebrating their lack of commit-
ment and responsibility by intoxicat-
ing themselves. Drugs. Has there ever
been a more vague word? The word
could be referring to any of the hun-
dreds of thousands of chemicals, man
made and naturally-occurring, that
grace this planet. However, when peo-
ple use the term it is usually in relation
to chemicals that are used for recrea-
tion: for fun. I am a little hesitant on
embarking on this subject for fear of
being seen as one who is a) an ‘addict’
or b) an endorser/pusher of inebriants/
bad influence. Perhaps after reading
this you will have made up your mind
about where I stand on the matter.
Part of the reason for voicing my
opinion on this subject springs from
the recent re-classification of Mari-
juana. In 2004 it was moved from a
Class B to a Class C drug, which in-
cludes other substances such as Keta-
mine and GHB. It will soon be a Class
B once again, alongside drugs such as
Amphetamines and Ritalin, due to the
fact that apparently the ‘dope’ grac-
ing our streets nowadays is “stronger”
than the stuff circulating in the swing-
ing Sixties. This may be very true, and
several friends who are partial to the
Green stuff have confirmed this. How-
ever, it is very hard to prove something
like the chemical composition of illegal
plants when there is no system to regu-
late them. I am sure the Government
would rather just be safe than end up
in twenty odd years with a huge NHS
bill to pay for the hundreds/thousands
of adults developing mental illness on
account of excessive use in their teen
years. Another colossal blanket state-
ment I heard uttered on the news was
that “young people are more at risk of
taking drugs because drugs are cheap.”
HA! I do not consider fifty pounds for
one gram of what is, in reality, only
~10% of Columbian origin to be cheap!
The goods available on Camden Bridge
are often a variety of cooking herb and
the hassle that is required to seques-
ter the more clandestine substances
is not symptomatic of a society where
our children cannot move for drug
pushers.
Ialsotakeexceptiontotheabundance
of ignorance that exists in relation to
illegal drugs. I, being a biochemist/re-
tard, am aware of exactly what happens
to the body when certain chemicals hit
our blood and brains (although, I still
struggle with the equation of a line).
Friends of mine have sent me into
apoplectic frustration when they make
comments such as “drugs make you
thirsty and so you drink so much water
you die”. I doubt your average punter
has any clue as to the effects of most
substances and more should be done
to educate people: giving them unbi-
ased information with which they can
make informed, adult decisions. (How-
ever, a vast majority in this country is
not even capable of that, it seems).
What so many people forget is that
alcohol is a drug, one to which Britain
is hopelessly addicted. In every form of
media, it is referred to in isolation from
the “big, bad” drugs. many of which are
just as harmful or even less harmful
than alcohol.
“Do not mix drugs and alcohol”. This
is sound advice as ingesting a cocktail
of chemicals (whatever the type, be it
prescribed, Boots-bought or otherwise)
is never wise given the risk of drug in-
teractions. Does this mean we should
not mix alcohol with alcohol? Probably,
as mixing one’s drinks can often lead to
a hangover making you wish you were
actually hardcore straight-edge.
When you compare the data of the
“Two E’s” (ethanol and ecstasy) it is
quite clear that from both a medi-
cal and social point of view, ecstasy is
‘better’ for you. At the mention of Ec-
stasy people have the nineties-painted
stereotype of sweaty, water-swigging
ravers hugging each other (“I love you,
mate”). But, compare 10 deaths per
annum from ecstasy to 22,000 alcohol
related deaths. Admittedly, there are
many, many more ethanol “users” than
that of ecstasy but I am sure if you cal-
culated deaths as a percentage of users,
alcohol would come out worse. There
is no heart, liver or cardiovascular dis-
ease associated with MDMA (ecstasy’s
chemical name) and absolutely no
negative social impact from it either.
All the brawls, vomit, glass and ke-
bab detritus are from alcohol abusers.
Again, I am a hypocrite. I do enjoy a
tipple or two but I have never caused a
fight, eaten a kebab or dirtied the street
in anyway in my drunken state.
Currently, medical research is un-
derway to examine MDMA as a tool
in psychotherapy and marriage coun-
selling on account of its effects which
induce an increased empathy for one’s
peers, breaking down barriers that
years of resentment could have built.
Indeed, shortly after its creation by
Alexander Shulgin in Germany, it was
being used as a “truth serum” in WWI
(to no great success).
I have tried and tried, and to no avail,
to find through PubMed any research
journals which describe the long and
short-term effects (both on the body
and on the brain) of LSD. It seems
the only risks associated are ‘flash-
backs’ (rare in any case) and impaired
judgments whilst under the influ-
ence, exactly like alcohol. Oh, and one
shouldn’t take it if pregnant because it
may cause uterine contractions. Not
really an issue for most: any woman
considering any drugs while pregnant
is very unwise.
Please do not assume I am encour-
aging people to experiment unwisely
and with gay abandon (if at all). What-
ever be your poison, moderation and
balance is key. People who think that
taking one pill a few times a month
is worse for you than heavy drinking
several times a week are gravely mis-
taken. However, if the bi-monthly pill
is having an effect on your work/life/
relationships/health then it is time to
stop.
For a lot of people, exercising mod-
eration is beyond them and so Britain
has a binge drinking epidemic. But for
now, exams desist, spirits are high (pun
completely and utterly intended) and I
bid you a fantastic summer!

A. Geek
That’s all, folks
A
lright, I admit it. Things
got the better of me last
week. Those bastard
things. God knows why I
feel the need to apologise
to you, but Tomo’s mournful footnote
nudged me towards guilt last week, so,
well, I’m sorry. Okay? I didn’t mean to
hurt you.
The fact is, it’s Summer now. You
know it, I know it, the guy who designs
the uniforms for Starbucks coffee evi-
dently knows it. Believe it or not, this
week’s column comes to you all the
way from a glamorous holiday loca-
tion. A Geek is on vacation.
This is good for a variety of reasons.
Firstly, I can forget the NUS exists. I
get that nice feeling of peace that I as-
sume the GI’s also felt when they took
leave in Paris during World War 2. Sip-
ping absinthe, with the sound of Kirsty
Patterson being dropped out of a B52
somewhere in the east. Distant car-
nage – the best kind of carnage there
is. I’ve even got a Crunchie.
Other than distance from the Union
Senate Council Committee, and the
presence of a bar of milk chocolate with
a golden honeycombed centre, life’s
also good because there’s nothing for
me to do except wear sunglasses that
don’t suit me, and play a hell of a lot of
Guitar Hero 3. Fuck the advancement
of human understanding for a week or
two – I’ve got a date with Sunshine Of
Your Love on Hard.
I feel bad for liking Guitar Hero 3 so
much, because it’s one of those shitty
halfway house games. On the one
hand, it’s hip and esoteric enough to
alienate a lot of gamers (if you’re not
aware, it’s played by strangling an ac-
tual plastic guitar to death in your liv-
ing room) but on the other hand I look
like a cock who prefers videogames to
drugs,concertsandbooze.Therefresh-
ing combination of looking like a twat
and even repelling nerds is strangely
appealing to me, though. Sometimes I
even whammy a bit.
That’s what I like about videogames,
film, and being eleven years old. They
all let you pretend and imagine things
in an entirely safe environment. Sure,
Ammar Waraich has stared into the
abyss of human nature, wheras the
best I’ve managed is to stare into the
high scoreboard of Talk Dirty To Me.
Anyone who pens pseudo-intellectual
crap in the Games section is kidding
themselves if they think the real world
is comparable to a 17” monitor. But it
offers respite and entertainment. And
so far, no-one’s proved it to be addict-
ing. Which is nice.
Why take second-best to reality? Be-
cause I, like many of you, are power-re-
laxing this Summer. Placements, work
experience and internships mean that
magical “four-month” holiday is dis-
embowelled until a paltry few weeks
remain. Once the full Imperial exodus
is completed for you – savour the last
days of halls, first years – you may find
less time to read Dawkins’ complete
works than you thought (I’m missing
you more than him, Garnet).
So even though your year has only
just ended, don’t put off relaxation.
Spend a little extra money, see Hyde
Park before you leave, and remember
to take a pigeon home for your young-
er brother.

Believe
it or not, this
week’s column
comes to you
all the way from
a glamorous
holiday location.
A Geek is on
vacation.
Why the happy ending to a year of
A Geek? I think it’s just the escape out
of London. The greyness disappears,
and like that expensive mouthwash on
TV, you can see the anger flying out
with it into the metaphorical sink. I’ve
become a Guitar Hero, and the sun’s
shining. And I’ve got a Crunchie. This
is fucking amazing.
Tune in next year, I guess. Until
then, continue being idiotic, hypo-
critical and greedy, folks. I’ll be taking
notes.
Dear Editors,
I am writing about your article 'Men-
tal health at IC: Who cares?' in last
week's Felix. The Student Counsel-
ling Service welcomes the raising of
the important issue of student men-
tal health. Students need to know
who they can contact if they are
experiencing mental health difficul-
ties whilst at College. Unfortunately,
there seems to have been a misun-
derstanding about the composition
of mental health facilites at Col-
lege; the overall facility on campus
is much larger than you describe.
As well as the Student Counselling
Service, Imperial College Health
Centre offers its own counselling fa-
cility; inclusion of information from
the Health Centre gives a more com-
prehensive picture.
Further information about student
counselling at Imperial can be found
at www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling
and at www.imperialcollegehealth-
centre.co.uk

David Allman

Letter to Felix
Mental health
facilities
clarification
Many thanks to everyone at Felix.
I’m sorry I was unable to make it
to the meetup, but you probably
didn’t have Crunchies anyway.
It’s been a great year, kudos to
Tom and the Dep Eds for keeping
the paper running through the
tough summer weeks. Looking
forward to next year with you all.
Much love,
The G
