Music
Music Editors – Peter Sinclair and Susan Yu
Peter Sinclair
Music Editor
Efterklang are fucking great
There’s no doubt about it. Felix’s Efterklang correspondant Guy Andrews spoke to
band member Casper Clausen shortly before their show at The Queen Elizabeth Hall
O
utside London there
are lots of other places,
for example Glasgow,
Bristol and Norwich.
Even further afield,
there are places such as France and
even Singapore. As exam season
finally gets around to pissing itself out
and the summer holidays open their
arms wide, embracing us into their
welcoming bosom, many of us will
be returning to our places of origin
outside of South Kensington to while
away our summer months, get jobs, or
do whatever it is we like to do when
we aren’t doing science.
Music-wise, some people are much
luckier than others when it comes
to where they will be heading to in
the next few weeks. If you read these
pages often enough you will have
no question that for those staying in
London over the summer there will
be enough stuff going on to keep
you entertained. This time of year in
particular is good for day festivals,
not to mention that Radiohead thing
that everyone is boning on about. But
nonetheless, there are a lot of towns in
the UK that can definitely hold their
own musically.
Last weekend I headed down to
Brighton for a dubstep and drum
n’ bass night at a venue called the
Concord 2. For those who have never
been, Brighton is a 50-minute train
journey southwards to the coast. It
was popular with the Victorians as it’s
the nearest seaside resort to London,
and to this day it’s retained the same
kind of seedy, pleasure-seeking vibe it
no doubt had back then. Hedonistic
would be an appropriate description if
it didn’t require the expenditure of so
much energy. In Brighton, history and
geography have joined forces to make
the city, for it’s size, one of the most
creative and artist friendly places in
the UK, and although it’s not particu-
larly known for it’s dubstep, it seemed
perfectly able to hold it’s own in this
capacity (perhaps it’s all the drugs it
takes on the weekends).
Music from Brighton though has
it’s own distinctive style. It’s home to
two of my favourite record labels, Tru
Thoughts and FatCat Records, which
are two of the best known names in
eclectic alternative bigting eazy-vibez.
As for individuals, the town is home
to a mix of artists from just about
every genre, from the latin funk/soul
of Quantic to the scary mustachioed
goth-rock of Nick Cave, to the dulcet
tones of the speaking clock voice, Sara
Mendes da Costa. If you’re into the
weirder side of a weird enough town,
there’s a night called The Halloween
Club showcasing some of the more
bizarre acts of the Brighton music
scene. I’ve heard legends of an ambi-
ent free-form jazz Mexican wrestler
band, and a guy inserting things into
his ass while miming a handjob on the
microphone. He probably played some
kind of music too.
So the moral of the story is: Bright-
on is awesome. Also: Have a nice sum-
mer. Also: I need to leave for France in
2 fucking hours and I haven’t fucking
packed. And I don’t know french. See
you all next year!
S
ince it’s release in October
of last year, Efterklang’s ‘Pa-
rades’ LP has been a runaway
success. Most electronica
fans will eagerly tell you they
would literally piss their pants if they
got the chance to meet them, so we
jumped at the chance last April when
vocalist and multi-instrumentalist
Casper Clausen agreed to meet up
with for a chat and a sit-down.
How did you first get into writing
music?
That’s a tough one. Three of us grew up
in the same city, went to high school to-
gether and were in a lot of cover bands
together. Writing our own music was
just something that naturally came out
of playing other people’s songs.
Did you ever have intentions of
getting signed when you were in
these cover bands?
The music we were making was pretty
bad in the early days. Of course we
wanted to get signed but in retrospect
there wasn’t really anything there. Be-
fore we started Efterklang we spent
about three years working on a com-
puter, figuring out the ProTools system
and writing out little sketches. We took
out a big bank loan and purchased a
load of instruments and met Thomas
and Rune before making our first EP.
Where did you record all your
songs?
We had this room in Copenhagen that
we used for 5 or 6 years – we’d both
practise and record there. Recently we
got kicked out of that space and had to
move into a new room. It’s a lot worse
as it doesn’t have the nice natural re-
verb and sound that the original room
had.
Where do you get your inspir-
ation?
It comes from small things, things you
read, see, hear. I don’t think I’m really
clear on what exactly inspires me… you
can feel when the inspiration is there…
usually after watching a nice movie I
want to get creative. We also get a lot
of inspiration from other bands we lis-
ten to.
On your latest album ‘Parades’,
you’ve swung toward a more live
sound which is quite different to
the more electronic feel of your
previous two albums. What was
the reason behind this?
I think actually half of it came from us
wanting to do something more natu-
ral sounding. From ‘Tripper’ we
learnt quite a lot – like how to
melt acoustic sounds with elec-
tronic sounds, we just couldn’t
do it that well. ‘Parades’ was
just a pure mix of the two,
melted together to create
a sound that blurred the
line between electronic
and acoustic.
Some of the songs
are quite complex
in both melody and
structure. How do
you go about writing
such tunes? Are these
complexities planned
or do they come out
whilst playing together?
There’s no improvis-
ing, everything
is built up from the beginning. Occa-
sionally I’ll sit infront of an interesting
instrument like a celesta or piano and
will just play around, it could be a frag-
ment of what I’m playing that I decide
to record. Then it’s a case of muddling
together a load of ideas, over and over
again until something strange happens
and it develops into a song. Sometimes
I find myself walking into the next
room and listening to the song through
the wall, it’s a great way to hear if some-
thing is missing.
Are your songs hard to translate
into a live set?
It depends how much you want to
recreate the song. With ‘Tripper’ we
just threw the record on the ground
and built up a live version. We normal-
ly run to a rough structure in a song
and extend and shorten bits if they
work live.
On a more general note, who are
you current influences?
At the moment I’m listening to a lot
of Daft Punk. When we were making
Parades we were listening to a lot of
Popol Vuh, a german band. Also Griz-
zly Bear, Björk, Radiohead, a lot of art-
ists on our label Leaf. It’s great being
on the same label as some artists that
really inspire us.
What interests do you have out-
side of music?
I like collecting clothes. I really like
designing clothes too. My sister and
I designed the clothes we wear when
performing live and have just made
some new ones using inspiration from
the last ones we designed.
What prompted you to start up
your own label Rumraket?
When we were hand making our first
EP ‘Springer’ we just wanted to put a
label name on it to make it sound more
professional. So we came up with the
logo and stuck that on the CD. We also
hand made 1000 copies of ‘Tripper’
and put the Rumraket logo on that.
If your house or studio was
burning down, what would
be the first thing you would
grab?
The hard-drive! The computer
is really the heart of the entire
band – all our ideas are collect-
ed on the hard-drive.
What is the one thing that’s
the most crucial part of the live
perfomance?
Maybe the lead vocals! [laughs] Prob-
ably Mads on the computer. We want
to try and move away from the compu-
ter to give us a challenge but we know
we’ll always come back to that fucking
computer.
Efterklang are due to play the last few shows
of their solo tour shortly, before hitting the festival circuit
this summer. You can catch them in the UK one of a few
dates, including a London show at the Field Day Festival in
Victoria Park on August the 9th. See www.efterklang.org for more info
