Virgo
Last week you
left your mark
on Imperial quite
literally thinking
term ended last
week by planting
smack in your senior tutor’s desk and lying
naked with a belt wrapped round your neck
on his office floor and then ringing the police.
Your senior tutor is now doing 25 years in Park
Royal for sex crimes, but you still haven’t got
your degree marks. Who will you email now?
Scorpio
This week you
start looking for a
suitable carrer. You
quickly realise that
a degree in Material
Science is about as
useful as an economics degree fom TVU. To
forget your troubles you drink yourself into a
coma, only to awaken in 2065. The future is
bright, the future is Orange, but not for you.
Your Materials degree is even more useless,
you decide to blow your fucking brains out.
Libra
This week you
leave your mark on
Imperial by walking
up to a girl, looking
her up and down
and exclaiming
‘Dam’!’ The chaps around you are so impressed
they beg you “show us your ways”. So begins
the demeaning of the female populace of
Imperial,with the introduction of naked mud-
wrestling for entry to biochemistry.
Sagittarius
This week Impe-
rial left you marked
as a socially inept,
dribbling human-
computer-android-
sex-doll-Tory-
City-fodder with the conversational skills of
an earthworm accountant. And what’s more,
everyone hates you for all the above reasons,
so much so that whatever semblance of per-
sonality you had is whithered until your only
solance comes from cheese-grating your cock.
Capricorn
This week you
leave your mark on
Imperial by playing
the world’s biggest
game of Twister
in Beit Quad. The
game quickly draws attention and others join
in. Before you know it the ratio of boys to girls
resembles an EEE lecture and you notice a dis-
tinct whiff of unwashed penis. Alright... giggidy
goo... penis goo... mmm... I’m sorry mum.
Cancer
This week you
leave your mark
on Imperial by
digging a trapdoor
in the middle
of the walkway.
Underneath you place a meat grinder of
terrifying proportions. In a typically cynical
manner, the only thing you use this elaborate
contraption for is clearing walkway traffic
when you’re late for lectures.
Gemini
This week you
leave your mark on
Imperial by carving,
“I am Spartakus”
on your chest and
bleeding all over
Beit Quad in a final bid to get the attention
of your peers. However, your ridiculous
spelling mistake only brings in the mockery of
your fellow graduands and they are too busy
laughing at you to call an ambulance. It was
quite literally an EPIC FAIL. HAHA YOU DIE!
Aries
This week you
leave your mark
on Imperial by
leaving it better
than you found it.
Imperial students
are now broad-minded, eloquent and humble.
In addition they all have butterfly wings and
purple eyes. Ten hours later you come down
from your LSD-induced high as a Medic
vomits over your shoes... sigh.
Pisces
This week you leave
your Mark on Im-
perial quite liter-
ally. You are bored
of your current boy-
friend Mark and hs
habit of collecting farts in olive jars. At first you
found it cute, even sexy. But he began to open
his ass-gas receptacles and sample his past rec-
tal fruits. You break up with him by putting him
in a locked, windowless room with said jars as
his only source of sustenance.

Needy McNeedy: leaving university in ‘08... :-(
I
s there anyone out there who’s
actually in agony? I don’t mean
your usual pathetic whining, I
mean actual intense pain that
makes you scream like my lab
partner did when I touched his face
that one time. If so, please email me on
agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk. If you can
bear to type, that is. I’ve had to up the
entrance criteria since I’ve been receiv-
ing so much junk mail from you shits.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’ve been friends with a really nice guy
on my course for ages. We sit next to
each other in lectures, but I’ve never
been attracted to him. We don’t really
see each other outside the department,
and although he’s quite funny, I’ve al-
ways been happy with that. The other
night, after our last exam, a group of us
from my course went out. I ended up
hooking up with the guy, and it was so
hot! But the next day all I could think
about was how I’ve ruined our friend-
ship, because I don’t want to be with
him. What can I do?
Alienated
Dear Alienated,
This situation depends a lot on what
went on the next morning. If you were
hungover in any way and he had to
nurse you back to health, you’ve pretty
much promised him your ovaries for his
first-born. I think the best way to tackle
the problem would be to ask him for
coffee one day. I’ll look out for you in the
JCR, where I’m currently disguised as a
normal student typing their project re-
port (when really I’m a crack comman-
do team of advice wielding experts)
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I like to get a bit drunk and rowdy on
my nights out. Because I’m a man, and
everyone knows that us men like to
start fights with each other (as long as
they end with a pile on and a bit of a
grope). Only problem is, the Union,
source of much cheap ale and snake-
bite, has banned me from entering af-
ter I… actually I can’t remember what
I did, because I was HAMMERED!
Fucking great. Anyway, how can I get
nestled back into the loving folds of
flab of the Union belly?
LovableRogue
Dear LovableRogue,
Disguise is key. They couldn’t refuse Sir
Richard, or that new bloke, entry to the
Union, could they now? Get a good suit,
and a haircut, and a slightly surprising
accent (given your well cut suit). Or,
dress up as me. (See below for descrip-
tion of dress; think Thatcher mixed
with Dot Cotton.) I’m welcomed by all
Union staff, and indeed, I was respon-
sible for around 90% of the Union’s bar
profit last year.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
WhenIsawtheratioofmalestofemales
at this college I thought that it was the
college for me. Where better for a girl
to go to get the pick of the highly paid
men willing to fork out for beautiful
apartments (sorry, I watch too much
Sex and the City)? But it’s now the end
of my degree and I still haven’t found
the right man (i.e. one that will buy me
whatever I want). Where have all the
eligible bachelors gone?
CarrieWannabe
Dear CarrieWannabe,
Being the spinsterish cat lady that I am
(often seen trawling around Hammer-
smith with plastic bags tied to my feet in
lieu of shoes. No, really, that’s me), I’ve
honestly got no clue. You’re essentially
asking how not to end up resentful and
unhappy. If I knew, you think I’d still be
here hanging around here at the Felix
Office trying to cop off with whatever
miscreants happen to wander down?
(That’s an invitation, gentlemen.)
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’m just about to enter my last year at
Uni, but all my good friends are leav-
ing. Some are graduating and others
are going abroad, and I’ll have nobody
left to sit in lectures with! How can I
get on with my life now everyone has
left?
Despair
Dear Despair,
It’s like I said to Tomo: “If I kick you
in the balls, you’ll be so busy thinking
about the pain you won’t notice I’ve left,
and taken that Mac in the corner. Also,
I’ll actually believe the tears in your
eyes are for me.

Leo
This week you
leave your mark on
Imperial by finally
getting out and
meeting people. Yes,
4 years late, you do
what you should have done during Fresher’s
Week. “Hi, I’m Wendy” you gush at the person
nearest to you, only to receive the reply “Fuck
off you noob”. Determined to make an impact,
you decide to jump off the roof of Beit and
leave your bloody mark on the pavement.
Taurus
This week you
leave your mark on
Imperial by carving
your initials into the
buttocks of every
lecturer. As they
scream in agony you contemplate your time at
Imperial. That boy you fancied but didn’t get it
off with, that doornail that you liked but then
regretted sleeping with and, oh yeh, that time
you engaged in post-coital explosive diarrhoea.
Good times, good times, good times... sigh
Aquarius
This week you get
hairfever. It’s God’s
way of telling you
to commit suicide.
People usually get
depressed during
the winter, because there isn’t much sunshine.
You’d think then during the sunny season,
you’d be happy. But no, you’ve got hairfever.
See the logic? Yeh? Yeh? Kill yourself... no seri-
ously, I’m not joking... :) naw I am joking, no
but seriously kill yourself.
