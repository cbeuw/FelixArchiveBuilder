Oilfield Attack
Nigeria
Yesterday,militantsfromtheMovementfortheEmancipation
of the Niger Delta attacked the main offshore oilfield
belonging to Royal Dutch Shell. The group attempted to
destroy the main control room on the oilrig, though were
unable to gain entry. One American worker was captured,
but at the time of writing, the militants have announced their
intention to release the prisoner. Several further injuries
have also been reported. The attack has forced Shell to close
down the facility, which supplies Nigeria with about 10% of
its current daily oil output.
Missing Tibetans
China
Amnesty International has recently reported that over a
thousand Tibetan protestors ‘remain unaccounted for’. The
organization claim that many of these missing indiviudals
have been arrested during the recent months of Pro-Tibetan
demonstrations in China. The official reports reveal very
little, and indicate ‘questionable’ trials for a minority of
the detainees. The majority of those unaccounted for are
suspected to have been arrested arbitrarily, with no official
charges being levelled. Amnesty is also accusing China of
several instances of prisoner abuse.

Taliban Withdrawal
Afghanistan
The province of Kandahar is perhaps best known as the first
region of Afghanistan where the Taliban managed to take
control. This Thursday, however, joint Afghan and NATO forces
had apparently succeeded at finally expelling the militants from
the former capital. Provincial Governor Assadullah Khalid was
able to announce the same, adding that more than a hundred
Taliban soliders were killed or wounded during the clearing.
This latest story follows a massive Taliban-led jailbreak from
the city prison at the beginning of the week.
