T
he Political Philosophy Soci-
ety once again inadvertently
caused controversy in what
was their largest event of the aca-
demic year. This time, they invited
former Malaysian Prime Minister
Dr. Mahathir Mohamad to deliver
his first public lecture in the UK to
an audience at Imperial. The topic
was the war in Iraq and the initia-
tive to criminalise war but due to
some previously controversial com-
ments by the speaker, a complaint
was raised to the Union against him
being allowed to deliver a lecture at
Imperial.
In response, College stopped short
of cancelling the event altogether
due to legal issues, but instead lim-
ited the audience to members of
Imperial College only while also
banning all recording and photog-
raphy. The PPS was forced to an-
nounce this decision with less than
24 hours before the event and thus
the organisers once again received
angry emails from members of the
public and students of other insti-
tutions who had paid for and made
arrangements to come to Imperial.
Further still, College even restricted
entry to VIPs such as MPs and lead-
ers of NGOs who turned up hoping
to hear the ex-PM speak.
Many students were angered at the
logic behind such drastic decision
making and crowds were left wait-
ing outside SAF on the day of the
lecture as College security enforced
the restrictions. International media
was also present reporting on the
proceedings.
The event was nonetheless well
attended and a great success, with
College’s attempts at security unable
to prevent photography and a secret
recording being made available on
student news website Live!
PPS 2: The Sequel – Mahatir Has Landed
4
months after their alleged mis-
demeanours in the Union, Impe-
rial College Football Club were
involved in further incidents at the
Rembrandt Hotel and Motspur Park.
At the Motspur Park football
ground, the club was accused of be-
ing involved in fighting with rival
fans that led to seats being ripped
from the stands. At the Rembrandt
Hotel, ICFC was accused, amongst
other things, of being abusive to-
wards staff and smashing paintings.
A wider dispute regarding Felix’s
reporting on the football club devel-
oped too over the course of the year,
with several ICFC members perceiv-
ing a bias within Felix.
This dispute was deepened by a
tongue-in-cheek comment piece
lampooningfootballersbutultimate-
ly an article by Football Club Captain
Garo Torossian and an editorial by
Felix, laid the debate to rest.

D
ebate was sparked about
the place of cannabis in so-
ciety after the government
declared that it would ignore the
recommendations of its own experts
and raise the classification of the
drug from C to B.
Felix interviewed drug health ex-
pert Professor David Nutt, a mem-
ber of the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs, the body that made
recommendations on cannabis to the
government, who said the substance
should remain class C.

here’s still time to vote in
the NUS referendum if you
haven’t already, which was
sprung upon unsuspecting Impe-
rial students by Union Council back
in May (imperialcollegeunion.org/
vote).
After NUS Conference 2008, in
which dramatic governance reforms
were rejected by only 25 votes, Im-
perial’s delegates were left distinctly
unimpressed, with many speaking of
disaffiliation. An attempt was made
to force the referendum by getting
600 student signatures but it became
clear that it would take too long and
so it fell to Council, which voted
overwhelmingly in favour of the
referendum. Live!, Felix and stoic
tv held a debate on NUS affiliation
which included Kings College Union
President Chris Mullins and NUS
President Wes Streeting.
The referendum is currently ongo-
ing as this reporter types. The great-
est challenge for the referendum’s
proposers is raising awareness suffi-
ciently so that enough votes are cast
in order for quorum to be reached.
In non-hackery terms, this means
that 1800 votes are required for the
referendum to be legitimate. By the
time some of you late comers read
this, IC could no longer be a mem-
ber of the NUS. Once again.
Another NUS referendum...

S
ir Richard Sykes, the thirteenth
Rector of Imperial will be leav-
ing in July after what was an al-
most eight year tenure at the College.
During his time at the College,
change has been continuous to say
the least. Debates on whether or not
this change has benefited the College
abound, but one thing is certain, the
difference is palpable and much of the
College is inherently different com-
pared to the years before his tenure.
During his seven and a half years
as Rector, Sykes increased the over-
seas student population to about
30% of the entire student body,
whilst increasing international tui-
tion fees by what some consider to
be an extortionate amount. He also
controversially rebranded the Col-
lege’s identity, improving IC’s global
recognition, and increased Impe-
rial’s standing to 5th place in the
THES World League Table.
His successor, Sir Roy Anderson,
will take over in July.

The Royal School of Mines
attracted national media
attention to the College with
a statement on its website
labelling Camborne School
of Mines students “Cornish
inbreds”
The credibility of the National
Student Survey was brought
into question after a recording
emerged on Live! in which a
Kingston lecturer was heard
telling students to falsify their
answers
Imperial was found to make the
least amount of money from
library fines compared to 20
other top UK universities
Felix surveyed Imperial students
to hear their views on cannabis.
143 students were surveyed with 1
in 5 admitting to smoking canna-
bis regularly and a small majority
of 54% were against legalisation of
cannabis.
Ignorance reared its ugly head on
the day too however, with 64% of
students surveyed unaware that the
classification was being changed.
One attentive Imperial student even
asked: “Does this mean we can’t
smoke cannabis outside anymore?”
Golf clap, everyone...

n June, Felix delved deep into
statistics concerning the mental
health and well-being of students
at Imperial and also at institutions
across the country.
Over the last year, the number
of students searching for help with
problems like depression, stress and
relationships has increased by over
10% – double the average growth of
other UK student bodies.
Whilst it was found that students
at Imperial College use the Student
Counselling Services (SCS) 44% less
than the national average, it still
records 29% more cases of academic
stress than the rest of the UK as a
whole.
Felix’s investigation also found
that despite undergraduate students
comprising 64% of the student body,
they only make up 55% of the users
of the SCS; a low number compared
to PhD postgrads who make up 19%
of the university but 25% of the total
SCS users.
