Operator Please: coming to a Skins ep-
isode near you. They’ve got it all – the
looks, the age, the strings, the synths
and enough angst to fill up a special
edition box set.
But hang on a moment, surely this
is Be Your Own Pet in disguise? The
first two tracks have the great riffs (See
‘Zero Zero’), the pointless lyrics, the
two minute pop-punk tunes and that
has to be Jemina’s voice. But apparently
not, this very young-looking pop-rock
quintet hail from Queensland, Austral-
ia and can only pull off the ‘rock’ part
for half of their album – the poor kids
probably get tired.
Third Australian single, but yet to be
released in the UK, ‘Just a Song About
Ping Pong’ shows just how deceiving
these little blighters can be. I’ll let you
into a secret, it’s not about table ten-
nis – THEY’RE ACTUALLY SING-
ING ABOUT SEX! IN A SONG! The
tune acts as a none-too-subtle meta-
phor: repetitive, fast and it’s all over in
two minutes. I’ve a good mind to tell
their mothers, they still only look pre-
pubescent.
It’s quite a feat that vocalist Aman-
dah Wilkinson can switch from sound-
ing like Jemina from Be Your Own
Pet to Britney in just one album. “You
must think that I’m weird,” she nasally
croons in ‘Two For My Seconds’. Not
weird, Amandah, insane. Especially to
make a repeat performance in ‘6/8’.
Normal service somehow manages
to resume with ‘Terminal Disease’, the
band now sounding like their other ob-
vious idols, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The
blatant rip-off aside, it’s a short, dark
garage-rock ditty with ‘Psycho’-esque
strings, chesty vocals and some great
bitty guitar work – a definite crowd-
pleaser.
Wilkinson bitterly snarls her way
through the title track. It will never
make a hit, but only in the same way
that BYOP and YYY’s won’t ever truly
reach the mainstream. It’s another
one of the better songs on the album
even though, like the entire handful of
good tracks, it could have been ripped
straight from ‘Get Awkward’ or ‘Fever
to Tell’. Even with this in mind, the
Australian press seem to love them and
this Gold Coast band has got one hell
of a fan base.
‘Leave It Alone’ is another stand-out
track on the album. The chorus is far
too catchy, making it great fodder for
a radio hit. The tight drums even make
the string section seem less oppres-
sive. However, even on this track, the
energy the band produce live seems
to be compressed when recorded. The
record has an overwhelming sense of
being half-asleep.
You can’t blame Operator Please for
trying (except for the Britney songs,
there’s no sympathy there), there’s a
bit of everything in this album. They
go from the punk dancefloor fillers
like ‘Ghost’ and ‘Get What You Want’
to acoustic. Stripped-down ‘Other
Song’ is a suitable name for this non-
electric number, although I would have
preferred ‘Shouldn’t Have Been on
the Album’ or ‘B-Side to a B-Side’ or
‘Only Kidding Folks, We Weren’t Re-
ally Thinking of Recording This’. The
track’s only use on the album is to ex-
ercise your finger by pressing the skip
button.
The album closer has a fitting name;
with their countless influences and
sound-alikes, this album should be
the equivalent of seeing a star-studded
West End Show, only it’s more like go-
ing to a Bognor Regis ‘Pantomime’ (Ti-
tle of track twelve and another sodding
Britney number!) with Dean Gaffney
(Oh no it isn’t! Oh yes it is!).
There’s definitely some potential in
this album. The ability of the musicians
can’t be faulted and there are at least
four good tracks. Operator Please were

Queensland’s answer to McFly – oh please...
discovered overwhelmingly fast after
forming to win their school’s battle of
the bands competition and the LP al-
most hints they were forced to make
the album in a hurry. The composition
seems rushed and any essences of punk
rock have been overproduced. What
they lack is believability and urgency.
At the moment, Operator Please just
reek of bubblegum-flavoured teenage
angst.

Terrorvision were never going to pro-
vide an intellectual challenge on Satur-
day night, but then again there wasn’t
anyone there looking for one.
Theybecame(moderately)famouson
the back of 3-minute party rock songs
and even though it’s been ten years
since they’ve done anything you’ll have
heard of, it seemed that everybody in
the crowd was there to help them sing.
That’s okay though, because the av-
erage age in the crowd was closer
to forty than anyone would care
to admit, so the whole place had
an atmosphere more like a col-
lege reunion gig than anything
else. Or perhaps an incipient
mid-life crisis. The front-man,
Tony Wright (coincidentally
forty this year), certainly wasn’t
holding too much back, jump-
ing around like a Northern
Iggy Pop – he had far more
gas than I did for most of
the set for sure, but maybe
because of it he had to
take a breather during the
encore.
That, more than anything else,
dragged the level of the gig down to
the mediocre – while there was little
danger of the band playing a bunch
of new songs, their limited back-cata-
logue was painfully obvious when they
started repeating songs in the encore as
acoustic versions. That’s right, acous-
tic jump-around party rock. Acoustic
‘Tequila’, a song that’s only any good
at all if you can leap around the place
throwing your beer everywhere and
don’t listen to the lyrics too hard. I’m
not a big fan of routine encores anyway
– they’re supposed to be something
you earn, not something written
into the programme – but play-
ing an electrifying one hour set
followed by a dreary half-hour
encore left everyone feeling
like it had been a bit of an
anti-climax.
Incidentally, when did the
Empire get all staid and sen-
sible? I know the smoking
ban isn’t the organisers’
fault, but on top of that
the fun police have be-
gun to take a hard line on
crowd-surfing, and seemed
to have channelled about half
the venue’s power into ridic-
ulously macho air-con. That
in itself isn’t a bad thing, but
all the power seemed to have come
from the speakers, so you could com-
fortably chat to your mates throughout
the set, even from the sixth-ish row
where I was. Not very fucking rock
and roll, is it? Or maybe I’m just hark-
ing back to the good old days myself…

Terrorvision also at
Shepherds Bush Empire
the songs are formulaic and all sound
practically the same, but this energetic,
Beach Boys-esque formula works for
me and for thousands of girls all over
the country.
As a front-man Roy Stride gives it
his all – bouncing around on stage,
jumping into the crowd – the
works. You suspect he might be
a bit of a prick in real life, but
he knows his audience. I
found his Panto-style
“Who can shout the
lyrics the loudest?”
contests cringe-
worthy, but it
worked for the
majority.
Highlights
included a
cute little
song about
James Bond
and even one
about MySpace –
ideally suited to their fans. The
set ended with ‘Elvis Isn’t Dead’, in my
opinion their finest (and catchiest) of-
fering. ‘She’s So Lovely’ was the obvious
encore and after a bit of “last night in
our home town” stuff they departed.
It was the perfect gig for forgetting
all about exams and just pretending to
be thirteen again. I didn’t get to kiss
them, but going off that performance I
definitely still would.

I am probably too old to go to a Scout-
ing for Girls gig – I’d like to think I had
better musical taste. And yet nothing
could have stopped me turning up at
Shepherds Bush Empire a few weeks
ago, grinning like a mad person.
My first chance to see the sugar-
sweet trio was more than two years
ago in early 2006. Two musi-
cally ‘with-it’ school friends
insisted I come along to
some basement in Man-
chester to see a new
indie-pop band. To
my lasting regret I de-
clined due to a French
exam the next morn-
ing. Apparently about
ten people showed up
and my friends man-
aged to get off with
certain band-members.
A Scouting for Girls badge and
a French AS-level were small consola-
tion as the band started to get more
and more airplay and my friends smug-
ger and smugger.
Myincredibly unselfish boy-
friend de-
cided to
stop my
whining
with a
pair of tickets
to the final London
date of their tour.
Only slightly disconcerted by the huge
crowds of giggling girls outside (all
under sixteen), we made our way in to
discover we weren’t quite the oldest in
the venue – there were three drunken
middle-aged women and one of
the girls had brought
her dad.
Two sup-
port acts were
needed as Scout-
ing for Girls have
still have precious lit-
tle material. We missed
them both, which was
a shame as I now keep
hearing Go:Audio on the
radio all the time.
About 10.30pm Roy Stride,
Peter Elland and Greg Church-
house finally made it on stage.
There was a great deal of screaming
and I must admit I joined in. Scouting
for Girls make happy music for happy
people and I like to think I’m pretty
upbeat. Even the most teen angst-
ridden of their lyrics (“I’m not over
you”, “these dreams are killing me”) are
rescued by relentlessly cheery melo-
dies. The lyr- ics are incredibly
easy to pick up
and sing along
to and the mu-
sic is perfect
for those indulg-
ing in post-revision dancing in
the kitchen (just me?). I completely
agree with those who complain that
