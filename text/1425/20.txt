Olympic and World champions defeated
Christina Duffy
Imperial College Boat Club’s Freeman-Pask in impressive form as he takes LM1x title at Great Britain trials
Adam Freeman-Pask was unbeatable
in the third phase of GB rowing winter
assessment trials at Boston, Lincoln-
shire taking top ranking in the LM1x.
16:27.92 was the winning time; the
fastest clocked time over all divisions
on the day. This was almost two sec-
onds ahead of Paul Mattick of Wall-
ingford RC who in 2007 took gold
in the LM4- at the World rowing
championships.
In third place, twelve seconds behind
Freeman-Pask, was Olympic reserve
Rob Williams (London RC). Williams
was also the winner of the final cycling
time trial at a squad training camp in
Sydney this January, which Freeman-
Pask did not attend.
Coaches Steve Trapmore, Stuart
Whitelaw and Cox Henry Fieldman
accompanied the ICBC posse of LM1x
entries Freeman-Pask & Andy Gor-
don, M1x entries Simon Hislop & Dan
Cadoux-Hudson and M2- entries Dom
Meyrick-Cole & Henry Goodier.
Competitors were staying in the
Anti-Comfort Inn at Boston and were
just lulling to sleep when animal noises
(later described by distressed witness-
es as macaque mating calls) were heard
across the hall. The source of this noc-
turnal wailing was swifty identified as
the M2-’s room.
Sporty and Ginger Spice’s racing
combination are a nautical extension
of the cottage love-pair starring just
one member of the original version.
Come Saturday morning it was se-
rious business and Led Zeppelin was
drafted in by Freeman-Pask and Viper
Fieldman for some final inspiration.
Trapmore gave an in-depth pre-race
chat on “the finer points of sculling”
which was quickly summarised by
Whitelaw informing Freeman-Pask
“You’re not a bad sculler”.
This seemed to do the trick and with
a pat on the back AFP was sent on his
way to destroy the field.
ICBC had entries in all three men’s
competitive categories (LM1x, M1x &
M2-) with good results overall. Joining
Freeman-Pask in the lightweight single
sculls was Andy Gordon who came
14th in U23 (29th overall).
IC student Oli Mahony competed for
London RC and came 10th in the trial.
In the heavyweight single sculls race
there was tough competition with Alan
Campbell of Tideway Sculler’s taking a
clear sixteen second victory ahead of
Ian Lawson (Leander) in second and
Andy Triggs-Hodge (Molesey BC) in
third.ICBC’s Simon Hislop and Dan
Cadoux-Hudson finished 13th and
20th (6th in U23) respectively.
In the pair’s race Goodier and Mey-
rick-Cole came 18th overall (9th in
U23/5th in U20). At the half-way point
Run DMC had exhausted all leg re-
serves and had an unscheduled switch
to guns. Unfortunately these were de-
pleted even faster and after a failed at-
tempt of switching to lats there were
only a few strokes left in the race.
Back at ICBC basecamp Freeman-
Pask’s 101.2% gold rank win has been
an inspiration to the entire boat club.
The gym’s FitVibe machine has been
vibrating non-stop since the news with
crews trying to replicate the success.
Recent reports claim ITB foam roll-
ers (or AFP foam rollers) are sold out
across London. Pre-early morning ses-
sions have seen squads releasing all
tight fascia tissue and decreasing ten-
sion on the iliotibial band in a gracious
tribute to their hero.
But before we all get carried away
with Pask-mania let the truth be known
that Bill “Rigmeister” Mason (of ICBC
Club Room fame) laid his magic hands
on the winning boat a week prior to
racing.
Mason was modest in his contri-
bution to the result when speaking
to Freeman-Pask later; “You owe me
one”.Freeman-Pask has been develop-
ing momentum this season, posting
two consecutive personal bests on his
2km ergo scores [6:14.7 at a weight of
72kg].
This is testament to the hard work
that he has put in over the winter and
a big public statement for the develop-
ment of rowing at Imperial College.
matches before taking the field again
themselves. It was becoming clear that
Nottingham would be the team to beat
this afternoon with Bedford closely
following. Abertay rarely threatened
and Rennes seemed to be there main-
ly for the steam. Commendations to
them though for fielding, the pres-
ence of a French team (in this their
2nd year competing), alongside IC in
our first year with further rumours of
LSE and UWE joining next year seem
to be pointing to a second renaissance
in GAA and perhaps a ULU League in
the near future. All part of Michael Cu-
sack’s vision no doubt…
Our complacency regarding Rennes
was soon to be shaken off in our sec-
ond match, when the French visitors
against all expectations snatched a
goal in the first minute. Frank O’Neill’s
inimitable match analysis pointed to-
wards a distinct player who would need
to be marked out of the game - enter
Pat McMullen. With McMullen keep-
ing the Rennes playmaker out of the
game, IC opened their account with a
point from Lavery on the left wing. IC
added a few more scores with Conor
Taylor prolific himself and once again
combining well with the full forward
O’Neill. Despite holding the ascend-
ancy IC were not allowed to settle in
the second half and Rennes with some
good fielding and fitness managed
another goal and would’ve had more
were it not for some fine shot stopping
by Chris Farrell. Full time score 2-07 to
2-00.
The third group match was against ri-
vals Bedford. The humbling defeat en-
dured at Fortress Harlington was fresh
in many minds and IC took to the field
to demonstrate some Darwinism and
pain. This was to be our finest match
of the tournament; the team held its
shape perfectly and there were flashes
of inter county standard football par-
ticularly by Haugh, O’Shea, McCann
and again Taylor. Supreme fielding saw
IC win every midfield battle, supplying
an untiring forward five who added
score after score. On the few occasions
when Bedford did manage to break
into the IC defence there were stopped
in their tracks by O’Hare and Stranney;
McMullen and Lavery allowing noth-
ing through to trouble the keeper. Our
best and most satisfying match of the
weekend 4-07 to 0-03. Justice.
With daylight waning our final match
was against a respectable Nottingham
team who were eager to beat us to top-
ping the group. With qualification al-
ready guaranteed at Bedford’s expense
IC took their foot off the pedal and
rested Jimmy Haugh in nets. Notting-
ham took first blood and went in at the
half time break with a two point lead.
The second half saw IC regain the
impetus and decide they wanted to go
unbeaten on Saturday. Four well taken
points without reply took us into the
lead which was held on to in a fast
paced and physical closing ten min-
utes, including a spectacular double
save by Haugh in nets when Notting-
ham had broken through.
Sunday came and we were on the
road again. New York, as another guest
entry, had actually managed to top the
other group so they would be playing
Nottingham whilst we were due to play
Sheffield Hallam. IC sadly denied the
opportunity to Run New York then.
The return of Donnacha Kirk and Noel
Ryan to our ranks visibly lifted the
team and with a newly strengthened
defence, McMullen was moved into
half forward and Haugh remained in
nets. Immediately Sheffield were keen
to play a physical game, with some au-
dacious fouls which should’ve seen the
referee reach for his cards on at least
five occasions, O’Hare bearing the
brunt of this ill tempered exchange –
clearly one of Sheffield’s main threats.
Played on a soft pitch with legs al-
ready heavy from yesterday’s four
matches IC were a wearied team. Our
forwards who had dominated the day
before were tested a lot more by the
opposing defence and chances that
should have been converted were
missed, whilst defending was at times
slack, allowing Sheffield’s pacey corner
forwards the opportunity to score.
At half time we were down but not
out, one point being the difference in a
low scoring half. We drew level straight
after the restart but in the next ten
minutes Sheffield piled on the pres-
sure, helped by a large amount of cyni-
cal fouling and the referee giving them
the benefit of doubt, they ran out into
a strong lead. IC never gave up though
and did snatch a goal in the closing
minutes. Too little too late though, as
Sheffield had done enough earlier. It
was a disappointed IC team that left
the field but with a respectable score
line of 1-05 to 2-07 against a strong
Sheffield team who did go on to win
the tournament.
IC have a lot of positives to take
from the weekend, and eagerly await
the same Championships next year. A
great weekend of football was had with
a strong team ethic and some fantastic
individual performances. Man of the
tournament went to Edward O’Hare
who commanded the half back line
like it were his own and was respon-
sible for keeping IC’s conceded scores
to the minimum of all teams in the
tournament.
IC Gaelic Football has come through
it’s maiden season with flying colours;
respectable League performances,
club members McCann and Gallagher
being called up to the national side
and reaching the semi-finals in the
UK Championships point to a bright
future for the club. Gaelic Football is
here to stay.
