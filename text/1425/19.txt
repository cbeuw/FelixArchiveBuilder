Ho-down-roscopes. Somebodies shot your generic male/female relative!
This week felix have been taken on school trip to Texas in the US of A. We found it to be very dangerous

Virgo
You are the lucky
chunt (see next week
for a definition) that
is sent over the pond
to Texas. Have fun,
because over there
they possess the intellect comparable to that of
my middle toe on my right foot, i.e. not much.
Try not to use words longer than two syllables-
or expect long delays as they attempt to proc-
ess the sentence before answering ‘dunno’.
Scorpio
Apparently Kent
has been over run
by a gang of teenage
layabouts who have
had their belts stolen
so their trousers keep
on falling down. That’s only a minor problem,
the fact that they have a penchant for raping
old women is probably one that needs to be
addressed. Having said that, old ladies probably
don’t get much so I guess they might enjoy it.
Libra
I heard that
someone had told
me something
that I didn’t really
understand or care
about. No? oh,
probably just me then. No one likes the little
Chinese TV wannabe anyway. He smells of
sweet and sour pork that had been regurgitated
into a pint of Guinness and allowed to brew for
24 hours in an atmosphere of beer slop gas.
Capricorn
This week you take a
boy/girl home from
the Union. Big hand
fella/lass – he/she
had a cracking set of
moral ethics. When
fornication starts she/he immediately goes down
to your meat sword/tuna canoe. Kerrching! Then
suddenly without warning he/she bites your
penis/clunge clean off, you shriek in pain, but it’s
too late, he/she ate it. Pint?
Sagittarius
My my, look at you;
having a read of a
newspaper. Fool. Why
not get yourself down
to the newsagents
on the walkway and
pick up a copy of Nuts so you can wank yourself
into a frenzy over pictures of girls/boys that you
will never get. Oh yeah, this week you will have
trouble opening a bottle of bolognese sauce. Your
Uncle/Aunt may be able to help.
Cancer
This week the felix
team discovers that
‘somebody’ in the
the College reads
the horoscopes.
Apparently they
don’t enjoy reading about their daughters
getting anally raped by a horde of drunken
Football Club members in an alleyway in
Hammersmith. Well, if you don’t like reading
about it, we’ll send you the dvd.
Gemini
Stepping out with
your generic asexual
partner this week
then. Nice. Make
sure you form a
mutually beneficial
relationship based on trust, equality and
respect. Oh yer... don’t go for a dump in the
morning, at all. Do not run the risk of shitting
out a brownie so large that it leaves the toilet
absolutely decimated.
Leo
You come home this
week to find that you
have been burgled.
Unlucky son/female
relative!!! The bur-
glar was either male
or female as the quality of both sex’s tea-leafing
can only be described as equal. However you
assume it was probably a member of IC Foot-
ball as your anti-sexist views don’t help quash
your prejudices against sports clubs.
Taurus
You might have
thought that the
song ‘Boom Boom
Boom’ by the
Venga-people was
just mindless 1990’s
pop, but if you did you’ll be wrong. It’s actually
about, or maybe not about, fierce masturbation
over your girl/boyfriend’s hair/scalp. Just listen
to the lyrics... having said that Vengaboys are
actually shittier than a Phil Collins drum solo.
Aries
Today will be a good
day. You will take
a shit so large that
it will have three
breather rings in
it. For those of you
who don’t know, a breather ring is when you
take a breath mid-poo and your sphincter
contracts, but doesn’t cut through the turd –
just thins it out over a small section. Under
inspection you will be proud.
Pisces
Ordinary, unexciting
and drab summarise
your week. Nothing
controversial will
happen at all. Your
application to the
Union fun police has been turned down on
the grounds that you once stayed out past
midnight and had more than the weekly
recommended alcohol limit in 6 days. You are
a fucking beigeist.
Aquarius
Your fortunes will be
mixed. You will have
enough time, money
and motivation to
complete necessary
tasks. You will or will
not meet a boy/girl, if you do they will be a 5
and you will talk about the weather and have
less chance of converting than the Milk Man.
In summary this will be a plain week, lacking
extremes. You either will or will not enjoy it.
Last week’s winners were Möchten sie mein
Manschaft who took it upon themselves to win
everything... well done lads!
Jov was really upset that nobody came down
to claim their free kisses from you guys, so to en-
sure you get full points make sure you pop down
to felix office in the West wing to register your
entry within 30 minutes of submission. All en-
tries will be charged, but may not be counted.

Coffee Break
36 felix Friday 20 February 2009
T
his week has quite possibly
been my busiest week yet.
So many thing happened
it’s almost like a blur of
unadulterated excitement.
I write this column as I speak to En-
och the mastermind behind the cross-
words you all enjoy so much. Well not
anymore. He has now stopped making
them, but whatever. Anyway here I am
telling him everything that makes my
life so busy, stressful and exciting at
the same time. I would regale the long
and some what entertaining stories to
you, however there is no where near
enough space. Sorry.
I will tell you one story. The tale of
the mascots. In particular the CGCU
mascots (Spanner and Bolt) and the
RSM mascot (The Davy). Both unions
are fiercely protective of their mascots,
and are probably prepared to throw
a few punches to ensure the safety of
these immensely heavy metal trophies.
Well as the story goes RAG (that’s
ICU RAG, not ICSM) bum rushed the
CGCU office, and stole Spanner and
Bolt, successfully might I add. After
securing the oversized spanner and
bolt, it was place in a high tech, maxi-
mum security location. Known only to
a select few individuals with national

security clearance. Seriously these
guys p0wn MI6. Yes I just wrote p0wn,
tough! Somehow though, the Spanner
was stolen from RAG (making this lo-
cation not so secure). Whadafuh?
This was a seriously not cool move.
Who would steal from a charity? Many
suspected RSM (Royal School of Mines
for those that don’t know). Would you
know it, the RSM played to these suspi-
cions, and organised a trade (previous-
ly in the year CGCU stole the Davy).
The trade was the Davy for Spanner
and Bolt, to which CGCU agreed.
The meeting time 11 PM, the meeting
place Queens lawn. Come 11:30 there
was no sign of RSM, Could this be a
ploy to steal the Davy and not return
Spanner and Bolt? Or do they even
have Spanner and Bolt at all? Turns out
they didn’t. The RAG committee got a
text in the late hours of last Wednesday
night, detailing Spanner had been bur-
ied in a certain location. RAG quickly
recovered the giant tool, and there
were no longer any lost mascots. Good
times. All in all, we are now in happy
times. CGCU paid a ransom to RAG,
which all goes to charity.
Also too many texts this week, the
cat phone actually caught on fire, so
keep them coming!
RAG-tacular!
