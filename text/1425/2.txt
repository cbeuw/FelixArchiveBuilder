Football Club
disciplined for
actions in November
Nearly three months after the origi-
nal incident, the disciplinary hearing
for the members of the Imperial Col-
lege Union Association Football Club
[ICUAFC], as well as the club itself,
was held last week. Counts of bring-
ing the name of Imperial College Un-
ion into disrepute were made against
them after their actions last November.
Back in November, felix reported the
actions of the Club, as well as the al-
legations that landlords and residents
had made against them [Issue 1416 -
27.11.08] which included damages in
excess of £1,400 to property and arte-
facts around the local area of the pubs.
The disciplinary hearing, which was
held last Tuesday [10.02.09], released
its verdict finding the individuals and
the Club guilty of the charges brought
against them.
The individuals, who shall not be
named, were fined various amounts
ranging from £35 to £80, whilst the
club will be forced to pay for any dam-
age caused during the evening, the fi-
nal amount being known once the final
invoice comes in. In addition to the
fin, the club will also have to do a to-
tal of 200 hours of community service
between a minimum of 20 members,
to be completed before the 24th April
2009.
The Union Disciplinary Board have
decided that all individuals against
whom charges were brought (those
who had caused the majority of the
damage), bar one, were not eligible to
carry out the community service as
they had paid a fine to the Union. Dep-
uty President (Club & Societies) Lily
Topham, who was also the chief pros-
ecutor, commented that she “didn’t un-
derstand why the decision was made to
exclude the individuals from the com-
munity service.”
Questions have also been raised
over how the disciplinary hearing
was conducted. All the individuals
who had charges made against them
had received notification of the hear-
ing, as well as the full list of charges in
writing and the Disciplinary Court’s
procedure.
Although the individuals had re-
ceived all of this information, ICUAFC
Club Captain James Skeen who was
there as the club’s representative, has
told felix that he hadn’t received any
of the information, apart from the no-
tification, before the hearing date, and
instead had very little time to review
his rights.
The Union Disciplinary Procedure,
which is not located on the Discipli-
nary Matters page on the web site but
found in the Union Constitution, out-
lines the rights of the accused, which
include calling for witnesses as well as
grounds for appeal. There have also
been rumours that Imperial College
has placed pressure on the Union to act
swiftly over the matter, as their actions
had apparently dented the reputation
of the College and its students.
Whatever the decision might be for
the football club, the one thing that re-
mains is the method by which this was
all done. The hearing and its proceed-
ings were kept away from the rest of
the student population, with the only
student input coming from the Royal
College of Science Union [RCSU] Mo-
tor Club who were the only students to
give evidence of the apparent tarnish-
ing of the College’s reputation.
Mr Skeen told felix “We feel that the
punishment is suitably harsh consider-
ing the proximity to the exams and are
now focused on humbly carrying out
our punishment.” One of the suggested
community services include repaint-
ing the changing rooms at Harlington
Sports Ground, which will come as a
nice present to other teams.
Many have heralded the Union’s de-
cision as a move in the right direction
after the numerous complaints the club
has received over the past few years.

New International Students’ Officer elected
Saki Onda will be the first ever Inter-
national Students’ Officer for Impe-
rial College Union. This new position,
which was only formed a couple of
months ago through Council, aims to
increase the representation of the vast
international community at Imperial.
Nearly 46% of the students graduating
last year were deemed non-UK, and
with such a large proportion, Deputy
President (Education & Welfare) Han-
nah Theodorou felt it appropriate to
create the new role.
Miss Onda, who has a seat on the
Union Council now, was unfortunately
notpresentatthemeetingthisMonday.
felix asked Miss Theodorou what she
would like the Miss Onda to achieve,
to which she answered “The Interna-
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
tional Students’ Officer is supposed to
be the representative voice of the inter-
national community at Imperial.
“One of their main tasks will be to fa-
cilitate an international students forum
where they gather views about issues
facing our non-UK students. They will
also work with the DPEW in liasing
with the International Office to ensure
that we are providing enough support
and information for international stu-
dents to ensure that their time at Im-
perial matches up to our international
reputation.”
Her position was determined by a
campus wide vote, where only 112
students voted, however, Miss Onda
won by a clear margin getting a total
of 87 votes. Hopefully the turnout for
the Sabbatical positions, which are also
College-wide, will yield a much higher
number.

Imperial College NHS
caught up in ‘Lords for
Hire’ scandal
Imperial college NHS Trust is cur-
rently at the centre of a fraud inquiry
involving Americium Developments,
an Edinburgh-based IT firm and Com-
bineMed, a US health firm.
Scotland Yard is investigating al-
legations that Americium unfairly or
fraudulently helped CombineMed win
a tender to supply information tech-
nology services to Imperial College
NHS Trust. The deal was potentially
worth tens of millions of pounds.
The Trust had initially hired Ameri-
cium to organise the tender for a new
internet system. The firm was respon-
sible for handling the bidding process.
However, unbeknownst to the Trust,
Americium was at the same time be-
ing hired by one of the bidders, Com-
bineMed, in order to promote the firm
and help it win the contract.
It is alleged that to beat out the other
36 bidders, Americium used its insider
knowledge to assist CombineMed in
writing the tender specification. Staff
were also coached in how to answer any
crucial questions that the firm might
get asked. What’s more, an Americium
employee was sitting on the selection
panel that eventually awarded the con-
tract to CombineMed.
Also implicated in the fraud is Lord
Moonie, who is paid to act as a con-
sultant for Americium. Last month
Lord Moonie was named as one of four
peers who were willing to amend a law
in return for money in the ‘Lords for
Hire’ scandal. He is now being investi-
gated for using his government links to
help secure Americium’s business with
CombineMed. Three of his business
associates at Americium have been ar-
rested and charged with conspiracy to
commit fraud.
Imperial college NHS Trust termi-
nated its contract with Americium on
hearing that the firm was receiving
monthly payments to promote Com-
bineMed. The trust’s counter fraud
specialist contacted the Metropolitan
Police fraud squad as soon as allega-
tions came to light. The NHS Trust has
now also cancelled its contract with
CombineMed and severed its links
with Americium. It has said it is unable
to comment on the situation due to the
ongoing criminal investigations.

A tribute to Sir Henry Tizard,
because we messed up
Sir Henry Tizard, rector from 1929 to
1942 was arguably one of the most in-
fluential of all past rectors. His great
vision saw Imperial College as a much
larger and prominent institution of
higher education in Great Britain and
eventually, the world. To do this, the
campus had to expand to accommo-
date the influx of outstanding academ-
ics and stellar students. As a result, he
put the wheels in place to purchase the
Royal School of Needlework, a large
building on Exhibition Road. Being in
touch with students’ needs and under-
standing their wants, Tizard purchased
the land at Harlington, still used to-
day as Imperial’s main sports ground.
Much of the campus as we know today
exists because of Sir Henry Tizard’s
dedication to the college, its students
and its staff.
A chemist and a mathematician by
training, Tizard was a prominent fig-
ure in the country’s scientific commu-
nity and was one of the pioneers of the
radar preceding WWII.
During the war, the rector was
known for spending many nights at
the college, fraternizing with both staff

and students alike in an entirely infor-
mal and friendly fashion. In 1963, one
of the main halls of residence in South-
side was named after him, officially
acknowledging his commitment to the
institution.

Union support
“axe the beer tax”
campaign
The Editor’s favourite beer could now be cheaper, but sadly not better.
Imperial College Union [ICU] Coun-
cil passed a motion this Monday that
would see ICU support the Campaign
for Real Ale [CAMRA] and the British
Beer and Pub Association campaign
named ‘Axe the beer tax – save the
pub’.
The campaign has five key objec-
tives, which included plans to stop the
increase in beer tax up to a third, to
enforce existing laws – not create new
ones – to deal firmly with irresponsi-
ble drinkers and premises, to end the
irresponsible promotion of alcohol in
supermarkets, pubs and elsewhere, to
trust responsible adults to make in-
formed choices about what they drink,
Jovan Nedić
Editor in Chief
not punish them for the actions of an
irresponsible minority and finally to
support the British pub as a vital part
of social life in local communities.
One of the arguments used by Tim
Barrett (ICU Welfare Campaigns Of-
ficer) who was the proposer of the pa-
per, argued that the increasing costs
at public houses, directly related to
taxation, having a direct cost on the
long term welfare of students - both
financially and damaging student wel-
fare through losing affordable places to
socialize, thereby limiting the student
experience. The news will undoubtedly
please a vast majority of the student
population at Imperial, as it will hope-
fully mean a slow down in the increas-
ing cost of beer that has been seen in
the Union.

Imperial postgraduate
student shortlisted for
prestigious 2009 IET Award
A postgraduate student from the Fac-
ulty of Electronic Engineering has been
shortlisted for the prestigious 2009
IET Young Woman Engineer of the
Year Award. Hanna Sykulska, has just
finished her PhD, was part of NASA’s
2008 Pheonix mission that furthered
the exploration of Mars. the Institu-
tion of Engineering and Technology
(IET) deemed her outstanding work
with NASA worthy of nomination.
IET is a global professional society
for communities working in engineer-
ing and technology, which claims to
‘promote the positive role of science’
within the world.
The award Sykulska is nominated for
is awarded to an up-and-coming female
who has set herself up to be a ‘dynamic
and technically excellent professional’.
If Sykulska is to win, she will become
an IET role model for females in the
engineering industry, and one that will
be able to inspire more women to enter
the male-majority industry.
Sykulska was scouted by NASA
to become their Instrument Down-
link Engineer (IDE) for the Phoenix
mission at NASA mission control in
Arizona. She was one of three Impe-
rial-based researchers to make up the
Phoenix team. The mission involved
sending a solar-panelled device to
investigate previously unchartered
Northern plains of Mars, where upon
terrain conditions and compositions
were analysed.
Sykulska was responsible for both
the design and feedback stages of the
mission. She helped develop technol-
ogy that was designed to hold Martian
soil samples, but also monitored the
information the craft was sending back
to the laboratory once it has landed.
Though the mission has ended,
Sykulska will found out if her work
on Phoenix is enough to win the IET
award on the 26th February.
However, she has set her sights on
further exploration, saying “I certainly
want to send more instruments into
space and have the rare opportunity to
look at different planets.”
