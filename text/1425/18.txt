As secrets and desire threaten
to push Aaron and Anis to the
point of no return, the fate of
the diamonds, and the peo-

poised for disaster. Can Aaron
and Anis survive the pande-
monium, or will greed have the
last laugh?

International Night 2009
F
riday saw the successful re-
turn to the Great Hall of Im-
perial College International
Night 2009. Worries over
ticket sales in the run up to
the event proved unfounded as more
than 300 students defied the credit
crunch to attend a truly spectacular
extravaganza of multicultural talent.
After an initial Flag Dance introduc-
ing the International Societies to the
audience the night began with a carni-
val feel thanks to the Afro-Caribbean
Society’s colourful dance. Next up was
the Malaysian Society with their crea-
tive Stomp act. Special recognition is
due here as they willingly took part
with little notice as a last minute re-
placement for other acts which pulled
out with only a week to go!
The Belly-dancers continued to wow
the crowd with their hip-shaking antics
whilst the Imperial College Advanced
Tap Team performed a great audition
for the next James Bond introduc-
tion video. In their first performance
of the night the Cypriot Society were
welcomed onto the stage by their huge
following of fans to perform a medley
of dances including the Syrtos, Stamna
and Sousta. The final act of the first
half was a highly entertaining comedy
sketch from the Arabic Society who
showed us just how much fun Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire, The X-Fac-
tor and Gladiators can be.
Peter Welsby takes us through the highs (and well it was great) of the hip-shaking, tap-dancing, pride-
making, Zorba-dancing night that is International Night
The crowd were reawakened after
the interval by the new pioneers of
Chinese rock, MACE, representing the
Chinese Student and Scholars Associa-
tion. Super Mario, Zelda, Link, Peach
and of course Pikachu were given a big
fright by the mighty Godzilla in a Japa-
nese sketch demonstrating the impor-
tance of pride and bravery. A stunning
display of martial arts was given by the
Wushu Society who impressed the au-
dience with their powerful routine. The
scene was then set for the return of the
crowd-pleasing Cypriot Society who
performed the ever popular Zeibekiko
and Zorba the Greek. It was a fitting
final act before the Grand Finale where
all performers were welcomed back
onto the stage for some final recogni-
tion from the audience.
The Arabic Society won the Best Act
award as decided by the OSC to com-
plete a clean sweep of awards follow-
ing their success in the OSC Football
World Cup in November last year. The
night was a fantastic success which ran
“The belly-dancers
continued to wow
the crowd with
their hip-shaking
antics”
East Meets West: the ultimate
celebration of culture
N
ow in its 17th year, with
tickets already in sale,
this February will once
again see the return of
the popular charity cul-
tural variety show: East Meets West.
Presented by Imperial College’s
very own Indian Society, the show
first began as a small student fashion
show held annually in lecture theatres
around Charring Cross Hospital.
It only featured 20 participants and
fewer than 100 audience members:
a far cry from the 1500 sell-out last
year! As the popularity of the event in-
creased, the show started to diversify
and widen by adding dance and music
from Indian and Western cultures.
This unique yet simple concept of
merging the best of both cultures and
blending traditional acts with contem-
porary ones was a phenomenal success
and in 2003, East Meets West was held
in the Hammersmith Apollo: the first
year that the show had taken place in
a venue other than Imperial’s Great
Hall.
Since then, to accommodate the
ever-increasing audience and mark its
Saman Zaman gives us a quick preview into what the
spectacular show has to offer this year
ascending acclaim, the show has taken
place in a number of prestigious venues
in the heart of London, including the
London Barbican, Shaftesbury Theatre
and London Palladium. Over the years,
the show has also progressed to feature
more cultures from all over the world,
such as Chinese Wu Shu, Russian Bal-
let and Afrogala, and the variety of acts
has included drama, comedy, singing,
catwalk, dance and live performances
from special celebrity guests on the
night!
From its humble beginnings to what
it is today: the largest show in Impe-
rial and the longest running student
show in the UK, East Meets West 2009
promises to be even more spectacular
and memorable.
This year’s line-up of scintillating
acts boasts the finest student talent
from universities across London, as
well as the best from Imperial College
of course!
In particular not to be missed are the
amazing performances by IC Funkol-
ogy and also bhangra by IC’s Ground-
shaker: runners up of The Bhangra
Showdown. Following last year’s im-
mense success at the London Palla-
dium, the show returns to the West
End again at the Theatre Royal and the
evening will be hosted by legendary
comedian and household name: Nina
Wadia of ‘Goodness Gracious Me’ and
‘All About Me’.
Finally, and most importantly, we
must remember the core purpose of
this show: to raise money and aware-
ness for the worthy causes that are the
charities we are proudly supporting
this year: Save the Children, Care Edu-
cation Trust India and Africa and The
Winnicott Foundation for neonates
(RAG charity 2009). Last year EMW
raised about £10000 for charity and
with your help we are hoping to top
that this year!
The essence of the show has been in
transcending all barriers and uniting
people from all ages and backgrounds
to celebrate the glory of every culture,
and by staying true to this ethos, East
Meets West continues to grow from
strength to strength.
We hope to see you all at the show
that it meets and even exceeds all your
high expectations, see you there!
without any problems thanks to the
hard work put in by many including
DramSoc, the OSC Exec and all our
volunteers who helped out. The after-
party at the Union continued until the
early hours where performers celebrat-
ed together after many hours of prac-
tice. Roll on International Night 2010!
