Technology Editor – Richard Lai
@imperialcollege: What is Twitter?
Why is everyone going on about Twitter? Richard Lai shares his view on how to use this powerful tool.
T
omo Roberts had just
walked into the felix of-
fice, rambling on about
how people had been try-
ing to get him to join Twit-
ter, but he struggled to understand why
they are obsessed with “telling people
I’m going to the toilet”. If you are think-
ing the same then you are probably
wondering: what exactly is Twitter?
And how has the 140-character limit
turned the site into a $200m business?
Twitter has been publicly available
since August 2006, but it was only re-
cently that the majority of Britain start-
ed to hear about this powerful online
tool, thanks to the participation of local
celebrities. First-time users may find
that Twitter alone is merely a website
with a text box, similar to Facebook’s
“status update” feature which is techni-
cally a micro-blogging tool, but unlike
Facebook your networking is not re-
stricted by which group you
are in - there are no groups,
and you can “follow” any
Twitter users so that their
“updates” (or “tweets”) appear
on your Twitter homepage. You
can also reply to
other users
by including
“@” in front of
their usernames in
your updates (hence
the article’s title).
The Freedom of Twitter
Like most social networking tools and
search engine optimization (SEO)
products these days, Twitter was
launched in San Francisco. Co-founder
and active CEO, Evan Williams (@ev),
was quoted saying that unlike many
articles that provide a list of Twitter
rules, there are actually no rules on
how you should use the simple tool - in
fact, most of the quoted terminologies
used above were mostly likely to have
come from the users “without any in-
put from the company”. Furthermore,
like YouTube, users have discovered all
sorts of ways to harness the connec-
tion power for learning, sharing, mar-
keting, or just for fun. (See the “What
people use Twitter for” box)
It is this freedom and creativity that
led to the birth of many Twitter clients
for different platforms. For desktops
(Windows, Mac and Linux), the star
of the show is the London-designed
TweetDeck, which not only automati-
cally retrieves updates at set intervals,
but also has a search feature which can
be a nice alternative to Google for cer-
tain criteria. I will explain this later.
See Your Nearby Tweets
Smartphones are also responsible for
the boost in number of Twitter users:
the iPhone alone has at least four dedi-
cated Twitter apps, and users of Win-
dows Mobile and Blackberry also have
a few options. The advantage of using
Twitter on these devices is that most of
the apps are location-aware, meaning
you can read tweets sent from nearby
devices.
For me, this location-aware feature
was ever so useful when I was covering
the CES in Las Vegas: using “Twinkle”
on my iPhone, I was able to ask fellow
bloggers for up-to-date information
regarding the show, as well as read-
ing CES-related tweets in a style simi-
People use Twitter for...
imperialcollege: Imperial uses Twit-
ter to highlight College news and
announcements, campus activities
and community events
jackpea: news feed, a good laugh,
celebrity haven (lately anyway), all
round pretty addictive!
deancarl: I use it because I find the
Facebook update feature to be too
‘closed’. Twitter lets me communi-
cate outside my social group.
ddudgeon: I use it to keep up with
the latest developments in my in-
dustry.
Lil_Wun: To share all the weird
thoughts in my head ^__^
drinkupthyzider: I don’t understand
this at all
TweetDeck, a Twitter app designed by a Londoner
lar to a simplified RSS feed due to the
word limit, so that I could plan ahead
for the following day; since I was also
looking after a demo room for a little
while, I was also able to use Twitter to
invite people to visit us. In fact, I went
as far as getting the attention of US
tech show presenter, Patrick Norton
(@patricknorton; currently hosting
Systm and Tekzilla; you can subscribe
the video podcasts on iTunes).
Celebrity Haven
Since the CES, I had tweeted directly
with Patrick Norton again a couple of
times. This is perhaps the main rea-
son that people join Twitter: you get a
chance to speak to celebrities directly.
In Britain, we have nice celebrities like
Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) who do
respond to questions and greetings in
Twitter, thus naturally gaining a huge
number of follow-
ers: 207,434 as
of Wednesday
8:50pm
(ranked
third
most follow-
ers, with @cn-
nbrk second and @
BarackObama first),
and going up literally
by the minute! So if you
do get a reply from Mr. Fry
then you are extremely lucky!
You will also find other active and
interesting British celebrities to follow
(they should all be genuine):
@bobbyllew
• (Robert Llewellyn)
– Red Dwarf actor
@WilliamShatner
• – ex-Star Trek
actor
@MayorOfLondon
• – funny man,
Boris Johnson
@CHRISDJMOYLES
• – BBC

@Fearnecotton
• – BBC Radio 1

@Wossy

@JohnCleese
• –memberofMonty
Python and Fawlty Towers actor
@GarethM
• (Gareth Mitchell)
– presenter of BBC Digital
Planet, also a lecturer in Science
Communication at Imperial
This list should get you going – by
checking out their “following” lists you
should easily find other people that
you might want to follow.
Practical Use
Of course, Twitter isn’t just about
stalking celebrities. Earlier this week
I had a new follower: Pamela Agar
(@PamelaAgar), Head of Digital
Media & Marketing at Imperial, who
is part of the team behind Imperial’s
Twitter account, @imperialcollege.
Ms. Agar said the idea of setting up
@imperialcollege came quite recently:
if you were affected by the heavy snow
fall a few weeks back, you might have
noticed the Twitter logo on Imperial’s
weather alert page - that was when Ms.
Agar’s team first signed up for Twit-
ter, as “a helpful extra way to get news
quickly around the College community
about what was open or closed at the
College”.
When I asked what Imperial aims
richardlai: For me it’s instant mes-
saging, news feed, travelling, celeb-
rity-stalking, market research, video/
link-sharing and blogging.
tadekk: I use Twitter mainly for fa-
cebook-status style microblogging
but really hope it will catch on in UK,
as it did in US
Twitter apps for the iPhone: TwitterFon and Twinkle
to achieve by using Twitter, Ms. Agar
expressed that they would like to keep
the immediate College community, the
extended College family (alumni, sup-
porters, prospective students etc.) and
anyone who is interested informed,
“We’ll be aiming to do fun takes on
what’s going on at Imperial – campus
news and promotions, announce-
ments, events and any other interest-
ing or startling snippets about College
we come across.”
On the student activities front, @im-
perialcollege has already tweeted about
ArtsFest, RAG week, the Great Egg
Race, Varsity Match, Union elections
and careers talks recently, so if you
were an organiser of any of the above,
do send them a tweet to thank them,
or better yet, send them a feedback or
ideas via twitter@imperial.ac.uk.
We are not alone though - a lot of
universities are already actively using
Twitter. Ms. Agar listed @UniofBath,
@warwickuni and @TuftsUniversity
as their favourite ones, so do mention
them to your friends who attend those
universities.
Smarter than just “Googling”
As demonstrated by @imperialcollege,
Twitter is able to provide the most up-
to-date information within 140 char-
acters, so by using the built-in search
engines in supported apps, you should
easily find relevant results to suit your
time-critical needs.
Here’s a good example: yesterday
I was looking for an Easter flight for
Hong Kong, and while searching for
airlines through the old Google way,
I also tweeted the found ticket prices
via TweetDeck, just to see if anyone
had seen cheaper ones. Soon, a fellow
Twitter user @sfahmy (who turned
out to be an Imperial College graduate:
MEng ISE ’99-’03, then PhD EEE ’03-
’07; he followed me in the first place)
recommended a few websites for com-
paring the quality of different airlines,
and he also kindly provided some tips
on collecting airmiles.
I then came across what seemed to
be a cheap airline called “Jet Airways”.
From Google the results were heavy
on negative comments, which were
not very helpful. I then switched to
TweetDeck to search for “Jet Airways”,
and immediately I had a list of relevant
comments that were of similar lengths,
making the comparison fairer. At the
same time, a few Twitter users also
responded to my earlier tweet regard-
ing the said Indian airline: the general
consensus was that Jet Airways is quite
good, but sadly I later found out that
the flight cost I saw did not include tax!
Nevertheless, the point is that Twitter
can efficiently deliver smart results,
thus making your life easier.
Where’s the Money?
While it is true that the ultimate driv-
ing force behind Twitter is money, I say
why not enjoy it while it is still ad-free?
There have been speculations that
Twitter will eventually start charging
commercial users (marketers, retailers,
etc.), but Twitter, Inc. is still keeping
their mouth shut tight about their rev-
enue model. This should not disrupt
the average users like us anyway, so un-
til then, why not join the party and see
for yourself how Twitter can be such a
useful tool? Happy tweeting, Tomo!

Dylan Lowe
Travel Editor
Tourist Vs.
Traveller
Dylan Lowe ponders what should be done when you find –
and catch – a Madrileño pickpocket
I
am not going to patronise you
with the boring bits of Madrid:
while writing pompous, repeti-
tive accounts of Plaza Mayor
or the Prado isn’t what I take
pleasure in, making you endure read-
ing them isn’t either. So forget the bull-
fights (they don’t operate during win-
ters anyway) and sangrias, let us delve
into this one thing the Spanish capital
is famed for: theft.
It appeared to be a bleak February
afternoon when my plane landed on
Spanish soil. The first SMS I received
was a distressing one: my German
friend, who had invited me to spend a
few days touring the city in his compa-
ny, suggested that I take extra caution
over my belongings. What followed
was the simple, but effective, state-
ment: my dad nearly got robbed.
Standing alone and helpless within
Barajas airport, I could think of at least
50 ways to lose my wallet and enact
each in my paranoia-corrupt imagina-
tion. Until the customs officer called
me over and gave me looks for my hid-
eous passport photograph.
Settling down at Cervecería Alema-
na (6 Plaza de Santa Ana), well-known
as an Ernest Hemingway hangout, my
companion gave a full account of the
ordeal: his father was boarding a train
earlier amidst a rush-hour crowd when
a pickpocket, seizing the opportunity,
snatched his wallet. Then, so clumsily,
he dropped it. His accomplice, cover-
ing the tracks, proceeded to return it
to its owner. However professional the
acting had been performed, there were
little doubt that foul play was involved.
And I naïvely came to believe that
a tale is as close as I could get to the
world of Madrileño treachery.
You little thieving
piece of...
I
n a rush to prove my worth and
(fail to) make my felix debut
shine, I forgot to introduce my-
self. My name is Dylan, first year
geologist and avid traveller. Fin-
gers crossed, I will live up to the stand-
ards set by my predecessors; for that
reason I pledge only to deliver articles
based on my own encounters and those
of whom I know, rather than those
freshly harvested from Wikipedia.
Mind you, I said ‘traveller’. Not to be
confused with ‘tourist’, which is not a
synonym of traveller – call me a tour-
ist and I will hunt you down in retri-
bution. There should be no confusion
in distinguishing between the elegant
traveller and the inconsiderate, preten-
tious industry that is tourism.
Or is there?
I have always branded myself as a
traveller, but only for vanity’s sake. I
have heard disgruntled moans of fel-
low ‘travellers’ over the mistreatment
they received from locals who ‘mistook
them for tourists’. Not until now, how-
ever, have I actually mused on this sub-
ject with a philosophical depth worthy
for such a controversy.
So where should we start?
Oh yes. I hate tourists. And I hate
being one. The way hordes of them
pour out of air-conditioned coaches,
the crackle as the suitcases hit the tar-
mac and the squeal of their wheels.
They banter in their native tongue and
whine about everything ‘foreign’, tram-
ple the streets with ignorance and dis-
regard for the locals, and wreak havoc
in hotel lobbies with their appalling
take on fashion (and brightly coloured
Gola shoes, in Afonso’s archetype of
an Iberian tourist). Pass nightfall and
yet another meal of Spag Bol later they
find comfort in their beds, but not be-
fore screeching at each other across the
corridors with booze-fuelled rigour.
Mind changed: I don’t hate tourists. I
loathe them, and I despise them.
And aren’t we ‘travellers’ so differ-
ent? We would come swaggering into
the scene, dashing and graceful, appro-
priately dressed and full of enthusiasm,
and get cozy in a local café. Ringing up
the hostel we make an enquiry over
our reservation using the local dialect.
Feasting on local delicacies, we ex-
change colourful travel stories before
descending into the fray that is a local
festival. We treat these words by Paul
Theroux, the legendary travel writer,
with biblical authority: “tourists don’t
know where they’ve been, travellers
don’t know where they’re going.”
Call me stereotypical and elitist.
Granted, like all existing stereotypes,
my definitions of the tourist/travel-
ler won’t work. A tourist is as likely
to lodge in a hostel as a traveller in a
hotel. A traveller may be the fashion
nightmare while the tourist is well suit-
ed in a tux. The person in the local café
can be the tourist, and he who peers
through the windows of Starbucks a
traveller (I plead guilty).
The distinction between the tourist
and traveller should not be driven by
materialistic measures.
It is in this phenomenon to dissoci-
ate oneself from the notoriety of tour-
ists and, more ambitiously, tourism on
the whole, that the class of anti-tourists
is born. My paragraph-long rant is a
prime example of anti-tourism: bitter,
elitist, easily mistaken as the works of a
xenophobe. We are the exact opposite
of the tourist, as the ideology suggests,
and we are better.
But is the ‘opponent of all principles
touristic’ a suitable definition for the
traveller? I don’t think so.
In fact, anti-tourists have a lot in
common with their arch enemies. As F
Daniel Harbecke, contributor to Brave
New Traveler (www.bravenewtravel.
com), pointed out: “travel becomes
tourism when focus shifts from the
experience itself to the vehicle of
experience.”
The attackers of tourism have be-
come tourists themselves.
To truly become a traveller one must
alter one’s attitude to – and expecta-
tions from – travelling. Which means
casting off your homely delights,
putting yourself in the shit, then come
out having had not only an adventure
of a lifetime, but a spiritual discovery
of oneself. Explorers are not explorers
unless they brave the uncharted waters,
and neither are travellers travellers if
they cower before unfamiliarity. The
off-beaten tracks are where the magic
of travelling happens, not the pretty
photographs inside your Rough Guide.
The world of travelling is reserved for
the dauntless. And those who are not
afraid to unleash their full potential.
I leave you with this challenge.

Got any travel trivia to share? I would
love to hear it. Send it to travel.felix@

In came Sunday and it was El Rastro
day. Madrid’s very own flea market, El
Rastro is every bargain hunter’s fan-
tasy. More like the ‘Royal Academy
of Thievery’, for those preying on the
visitors in the midst of the weekend
frenzy. My friend, still traumatised by
the incident in the metro, begged to
proceed no further.
I relented; thus began an aimless
wander around the city. Hours later,
the glorious Calle Gran Vía soon came
into view.
It wasn’t long before we made it into
H&M.
A short stroll into the store later and
I felt the twitch around my thigh. Ul-
tra-sensitive as I am, I readjusted the
strap and my bag swung into view. The
front pouch was unzipped. As my hand
dived through the opening it sensed
that something that didn’t belong there.
Another hand. The fraction of a sec-
ond that followed it swiftly retracted,
its owner fully materialised as a Span-
iard lurking behind my back, face dead
guilty over his fraudulent deed.
I wouldn’t have lost anything more
To commit an act of utter bollocks
3...2...1...
The Royal Academy itself, El Rastro
than a packet of tissues, since I wasn’t
foolish enough to leave valuables some-
where as accessible as the front pocket.
Yet I didn’t exactly do myself any fa-
vours by holding a Lonely Planet and
map in each hand, camera hung loose
around neck like the clichéd Japanese
tourist. I looked like every pickpocket’s
ideal target.
What could I have done to the thief?
I had the liberty to pin him down, de-
clare him a hijo de puta for stealing,
then hand the man to the police for his
crimes.
The police would have discharged
him due to lack of evidence. Only if
they bother detaining him in the first
place. Forget the police. Just a good
battering as punishment.
But who am I to judge? Whether the
man was driven to illegality by des-
peration or not, I would never know.
It would take someone with some
messed-up ethics to deliver a Judge
Dread sentence. Besides, I was more
likely to be persecuted for an act of
violence than the pickpocket for an act
of theft.
I could do nothing. So I did nothing.
I am not saying ‘for God’s sake,
avoid Madrid’. In fact, why should you
be deterred from visiting the city, or
anywhere else on Earth, by the risk
of theft and loss? You shouldn’t. Not
because these incidents are relatively
uncommon, but because you can pre-
vent them with the right precautions.
Once you have found – or caught – a
pickpocket, you would have gained the
experience to deal with a similar situa-
tion in the future.
And I will never wear a camera
around my neck ever again.
Don’t just go there for Hemingway’s ghost - the tapas and beers are
heavenly too
Jumping off a bridge with a latex rope
strapped to your legs? You must be
barking mad!
But who were the pioneers of bungy
(or bungee) jumping? Who was re-
sponsible for commercialising this feat
of madness?
Write a short account of bungy jump-
ing’s humble origins (no more than 150
words), send it to travel.felix@imperial.

lished in the next issue of felix.
