Last Sunday, nine brave men from the
Imperial College Union Floorball Club
battled on the courts of Bath Univer-
sity. The inaugural Varsity Cup, involv-
ing ten teams from six universities,
was the first ever competition for the
newly formed club and they were ready
to draw first blood.
The first match of the day was a
friendly with the Great Britain Youth
Team. Things started off brightly with
our strikers quickly establishing a 2-0
lead. The kids clawed back to draw
level at 2-2, before Hocks stamped our
authority with a goal to make it 3-2 at
the end of the first half.
However, things went south from
there when Gabriel suffered a shoulder
dislocation from the over-enthusiastic
play of our youthful opponents. With a
vital man down for that match, we lost
3-7. An after-action review resulted in
a reshuffle of positions.
The team had too many forwards,
and no one to defend. Bravely, captain
Jay, vice-captain Abiel and all-round
maestro Stepan volunteered to take
up defensive duties.Skilled and de-
pendable hockey-converts Gabriel and
Amrik masterminded the centre, while
natural poachers Hocks, Ben L and
Ben G would net the goals.
Our next match was against Bourne-
mouth’s 2nd Team and this would
count towards the Cup standings. Af-
ter the shake-up, our defensive line
held strong and our opposition had
nary a sniff of goal, with goalkeeper
Tomy caught relaxing by the keen eyed
spectators.
At the other end of the court, Hocks
delivered with a goal smashed in from
close range. Half-time score 1-0. Hav-
ing settled into our new roles, floods
of goals came streaming in during the
second half. Ben L, Ben G, Hocks, Am-
rik, Stepan and Jay all claimed goals to
seal an emphatic 8-0 victory. What a
way to mark the competitive debut for
ICU Floorball!
The second match would be tough,
with Warwick’s 1st Team who were de-
molishing all opposition left right and
centre. Right from the starting whistle
it was clear our opponents were a su-
perior team that trained together far
longer than we did.
Imperial closed down every opening
and denied Warwick for much of the
first half. However, rapidly tiring from
our lack of substitutes (just three com-
pared to their seven), we eventually
conceded and ended the half at 0-3.
During the break, the team decided
we had nothing to lose and should
press home the attack. With all guns
blazing we took the game to the oppo-
sition in the second half.
Pressure from our forwards earned
us a rare penalty which Stepan valiantly
Jay Zhongjie Chen took but was saved. Then, Hocks came
tantalisingly close after working some
magic in the box. At the final whistle,
the score was bordering respectable,
at 0-5.
Buoyed by the otherwise decent re-
sults thus far, we were ready to show
Nottingham what we were made of.
The match was scheduled to be the
final fixture of the day. However, Team
Imperial were starting to show signs
of fatigue from the lack of said substi-
tutes. Nottingham, with an abundance
of substitutes, came at us in full swing.
The Notts players were far more
physical than we expected, but com-
plaints to the referee fell on deaf ears.
By the end of the first half, Notts had
taken advantage of our battered bod-
ies and crashed in 3 goals. Even so,
the team knew one truth - we were
the better team technically. ‘Just keep
calm and play our game. The goals will
come.’ We told ourselves.
The second half started brightly for
us, steeled for the battering our de-
fence proved an impenetrable wall.
As predicted, the goals came. One,
then two and with just five minutes to
spare we scored the equaliser!
Final score: 3-3.
It wasn’t the ideal result, but we took
pride in working closely as a team with
determination and spirit.
This was the first of three legs of the
Cup and hopefully, we have shown the
other universities that we are a force to
be reckoned with in the remaining legs
to take place next month.

W
ell, we managed to
strong arm Nedić
into providing us
with an excerpt of
his interview with
our esteemed rector, Sir Roy Ander-
son. Lo and behold:
felix: You recently said that all
departments across the university
will be experiencing a 5% cut in
their budget. Many are worried
that the cut will affect clubs and
societies at Imperial whilst others
argue that this wouldn’t be so
much of a problem if we didn’t
have so many. Do you think there
is such a thing as too many clubs
or societies?

therector
Rector: I can’t make that judgement.
I’d have to part of student community
I think. Though you should review it
every now and again, see how many
members they have, what they contrib-
ute to College life. It’s like any business
environment where you do a cost/ben-
efit assessment.
felix: Seeing as you were such a
keen rugby player when you were
a student here, who do you think
will win at this years Varsity?
Rector: Terribly difficult decision to
make. I played six years for Imperial
College 1sts and we had a fixture list
that was much better than the medical
hospitals. On the other hand I worked
most recently at St. Mary’s in the bio-
medical field so I can make arguments
for both. I’m looking forward to a very
interesting game and I’m going to be
ruthless about judging the quality of
the rugby.
Now, for our take on the matters
raised...
Varsity, sports, Clubs and Socie-
ties – where do they fit in on the
IC agenda?
Officially, “Imperial provides world
class scholarship, education and re-
search in science, engineering, man-
agement and medicine.”
So where does sport fit in? For that
matter, where do all the clubs and so-
cieties fit in?
Personally, and I know this is the case
for a lot of students at Imperial, the
extra-curricular student activities are a
well needed relief from the day to day
stresses of labs, exams and lectures.
Moreover, with job prospects as they
are the added line in your CV noting
your involvement in give-a-shit soc
may just swing the employer your way.
So what am I getting at? Well there
are two things:
Firstly why so many clubs and
societies and secondly why the
difference in funding between
them?
In terms of job prospects there is the
argument that some positions of au-
thority within the union are worth
more than others, even the Rector
agreed asking for the need of a ‘cost/
benefit assessment’.
As diverse an environment Imperial
College is, we do not need a society for
each food group and we do not need six
hockey clubs. Correct me if I’m wrong,
but with minimal investigation it can
be suggested that the view of ‘any club
goes’ is being taken to the extreme.
The process could be described as
so: ‘Join me if you want, put twenty
names on a piece of paper and we are
away’. ‘If we convince them [New Clubs
Committee] that what we want to do is
worthwhile then we are away, funding
and all. All we need now is a name!’
My other issue that I mentioned in
passing is that some clubs and socie-
ties valued more than others.
Maybe I have answered this in my
previous paragraph – some clubs are
merely there because they provide a
off an impeccable midfield move off
a scrum initiated by O’Mahoney and
carried on by wing Joe Harris and ea-
ger beaver/flanker Nick Johnstone.
Then the guests decided that they
didn’t want to totally humiliate them-
selves and looked likely to score, too,
but their #7’s solo effort was stopped
20m in front of the IC try line by a
breathtaking tackle from Joe Brown. It
was obvious that this run was a one-off
and Cardiff didn’t want to push their
luck too much so they settled on us-
ing their forwards to cross the Impe-
rial line. After Freddie Chalke made a
cheeky escape off the pitch with an in-
jury, they finally managed to push one
of their props over but this didn’t stop
the hosts from getting right back into
their faces.
Joe Brown finished off another great
backline run on the left wing by skin-

ning their replacement winger while
replacement centre Adam Foley (from
Cardiff) got a bit homesick. That re-
sulted in an unbearable urge to join his
“comrades” in their try area. It was no
surprise then that the Exfoliator came
up with a great individual try after
handing off numerous fellow Welsh-
men before powering over the try line
just next to the right corner flag. Alex
Johnstone finished the game in style
by converting from far right to make it
38-7 but had to acknowledge that IC’s
superiority in the back-three was a lot
more important today than just kick-
ing balls off a tee - they can even kick
out of hands which resulted in man of
the match for fullback Max Joachim
who didn’t hesitate a second in saying
that the whole pack’s performance was
amazing on this memorable day at For-
tress Harlington.
All is set for a massive Varsity tie next
week. Who would want to miss that?

group of mates with a focus or it was
a pie-in-the-sky idea on a Friday night
that was followed through by the more
eccentric member of College.
Although I agree with the Rector
that ‘it is nice that there is so much
diversity’ there is a certain amount
of favouritism. Simply on a monetary
basis I can tell you that per head, the
subsidy given by the union can range
from hundreds of pounds to a measly
few, and it doesn’t stop there.
Some clubs go on to receive Col-
lege funding as well! So why this
favouritism?
Well firstly, as a long running top UK
World university, having decent sports
clubs and facilities is important for the
reputation of the institution.
Secondly, in recent years university
league tables have started to take into
account the sporting prowess of the in-
stitution, hence the formation of Sport
Imperial whose aim is to “promote and
enhance the performance and par-
ticipation in student sport across the
College in a safe environment through
professionalism, relevant adminis-
trative support systems and advice”
and essentially improve facilities and
standards of teams.
