A new device has been developed
by Imperial College, London and its
spinout company DNA Electronics
that is capable of testing patients to
see if they will react badly to certain
prescribed medications, such as anti-
depressants and cholesterol control-
ling drugs.
The prototype device, known as
SNP Dr (pronounced ‘snip doctor’)
works by analysing the DNA in saliva
or cheek swab samples. The process is
so quick that it can be carried out by a
GP before they prescribe the patient’s
medicine without the cost of labora-
tory analysis.
The device works by analysing genet-
ic variations called Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) which are the
parts of human DNA that control our
individual responses to disease, bacte-
ria, viruses, toxins or medication.
The researchers are also focusing
on how the snip doctor device might
be able to detect genetic sequences
which control the speed of our metab-
olism, something else which can af-
fect the body’s reaction to a medicine.
Slow metabolisms can make the drugs
last longer in the body and therefore
increase the risk of side effects, whilst
someone with a fast metabolism is
likely to process the medication to
quickly for it to have any adverse
effects.
The NHS spends £460 million a
year treating patients suffering ad-
verse reactions to prescribed medi-
cations, with their symptoms rang-
ing in severity from dizziness and
nausea to even heart palpitations and
unconsciousness.
Although the device is still a pro-
totype (about to begin clinical trials
thanks to a newly formed partnership
with the pharmaceutical company
Pfizer), there is hope that not only will
GPs be able to personalise a patient’s
treatment but according to Dr Leila
Shepherd, Chief Technology Officer of
DNA Electronics, the introduction of
the SNP DR might enable new drugs
to become readily available in a cost
effective way: “At the moment, some
cancer fighting drugs are deemed une-
conomical because they only work for
a certain subset of patients. If doctors
had a method of screening patients to
see whether these drugs work, then
suddenly these therapies would be
more cost effective to use.”
‘Snip Doctor’ to test drug tolerance
Last week felix reported that biofuel
crops may not be worth the effort, and
rank high on environmental impact.
Indeed, this may be true. Biofuel crops
must be grown upon arable land, fer-
tilised, nurtured, harvested, and proc-
essed. That’s a lot of costs that lessen
the energy gain the resulting biofuel
that they provide. But wait! Members
of Kingdom Plantae may yet save our
combustion-energy hungry lifestyles.
Look under the swaying palm oil
plantations, below the rolling green
cornfields.
Look to the greenish sludge chok-
ing up the water filled ditch and the
common stream. There lies a carbon-
neutral and theoretically inexhaustible
source of liquid fuel. It was the stuff
you had to scrub out of fish tanks, and
that you thought might kill you if you
went swimming in certain lakes of
the blue-green variety. It was around
changing the Earth’s atmosphere mil-
lions of years ago.
Algae
Before I ramble on further, allow me
to simply summarise for the lecture-
weary of you how biofuel is extracted
from plants. Plants photosynthesise
carbon dioxide and water into glucose
and oxygen. (No sh*t, professor, I prob-
ably learnt that one before I knew how
the birds and the bees fitted together).
The glucose is used for energy or re-
assembled by the plant into anything
else it needs- proteins, carbohydrates,
lipids… Lipids- essentially, oil. There-
fore a plant contains oil, much as many
other living organisms produce and
store oil.
If the oil can be extracted, it can
be converted into usable, burnable
forms. Although ethanol from crop
plants is used to make biodiesel, plant
oils can be made into biodiesel. By
compressing, by using enzymes, by
firing minute particles into cells, by
many means, oil can be extracted
from plants to be processed and used,
while the waste is used for fertiliser or
animal feed.
Enter algae. Enter a plant of single
or few cells that lives in water, repro-
duces rapidly, and produces oil. It does
not need tracts of arable land to grow
upon, it can double in volume in a sin-
gle day under the correct conditions,
and known strains produce a 50%
body weight yield of oil, compared to
soybean, the current leading biodiesel
crop, which has a yield of 20% and a far
longer maturation time. With tens to
hundreds of thousands of current and
undiscovered species, finding higher
yields is not unlikely- and, dare I say
it, there’s always genetic modification
to consider. Currently, researchers
estimate that one acre of algae could
produce up to 10000 gallons of oil per
year.
What algae *does* need in order to
become a feasible source of fuel are
cleverly designed farms that optimise
conditions without raising expensive
costs. Conveniently, such things are
entirely possible with human ingenuity.
The 18th century economist, Thomas
Malthus, famously placed unmoving,
exponential limits on crop produce
by tying their production to available
land; the 20th century economist Ester
Boserup removed this limitation by
theorising that human ingenuity and
technology would respond to demand,
and she has been largely proven right
till now.
Currently, several algae biodiesel
plants are open and running in the US,
while engineers work on improving
designs of sealed growth vats, stirrers,
gas venters.
Imagine a slew of algae biodiesel
plants being built in rocky land in-
hospitable to crops, but perfect for
water-dwelling plants that only need
sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.
Imagine algae biodiesel plants con-
structed alongside traditional power
plants to utilise the concentrated
waste carbon dioxide- such things are
being planned.
Based on its potential as both motor
and jet fuel, the UK government has
provided the independent company
The Carbon Trust with initial funding
of up to £4 million for a Algae Biofu-
els Challenge, which is ultimately in-
tended to commercialise an algae-oil
based biodiesel by 2020. Final project
costs are anticipated to be £15-23 mil-
lion, of which half will be funded by the
Carbon Trust. In 2008 the U.S. military
signed two deals worth about $35 mil-
lion to develop biodiesel made from
algae.
All this optimism sounds too good
to be true. I know, I’m a sourpuss too,
really. It can’t be that easy- after all, re-
searchers knew that algae could be a
source of biodiesel in the 1980s. Why
has the world been violently panicking
about petroleum costs, why did any-
one bother to revive and design elec-
tric cars, were they just for fun? Dull
day at the lab?
Well, frankly, up until now, the cost
of petroleum-derived fuel has just
been too cheap in comparison. Prior
to the credit crunch (don’t ask me for
updates, I’m scared enough just check-
ing my bank balance, never mind cur-
rent global prices), the production cost
of algal oil was still at about £2.80 /
L, while petroleum diesel was lurking
around $0.48 / L in the US. It still just
wasn’t cost effective to go green, and
petroleum produces so many other,
useful things.
Now? I can’t help but see my future
visions of electric cars fading, the
saintly masochism of restricting car
journeys for nothing short of emergen-
cies. No Mad Max style riots at petrol
stations over dwindling fuel, no wars
for foreign resources, no nuclear or
hydrogen power taking centre stage,
the development of cold fusion pushed
further into a theoretical future. But
who knows? There’s plenty of scope for
the future to surprise us.
As it stands, however, it seems that
algae is the only biofuel crop with the
potential to replace our need for petro-
leum diesel.
Future still green for biofuels

I’m so happy to see other people love algae too!
