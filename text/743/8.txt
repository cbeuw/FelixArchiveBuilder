The Nest by Franz Xaver
Kroetz, The Bush Theatre
until 21 June
The translation of this
contempary G e r m a n play
attempts to recreate the
realism of the seemingly
ordinary relationship
between a lorry driver,
Kurt, a n d his pregnant tie-
m a k i n g wife, Martha.
Unfortunately, the B u s h
Theatre's production of The
Nest achieves little in terms
of making a n y real
contribution to the "
understanding of the 'man
or w o m a n in the street',
w h i c h is what it s e e m s to
set out to do.
O n entering the ' L '
shaped theatre, it is not at
first obvious where the
stage is. However, as the
play begins it b e c o m e s
apparent that the wall of
gauze-like material in-front
of the seating area is to be
used as a screen through
w h i c h the action is viewed".
Images o n the 'stage'
behind the screen are only
visible when illuminated.
This effect allows a large
number of simple set
c h a n g e s to o c c u r since the
audience is unable to see
through the gauze when
the stage is unlit.
The plot revolves a r o u n d
the birth of a baby b o y a n d
the effect this has o n the
proud Kurt and Martha.
Kurt is a worker, a ' g o o d '
father. H e works to provide
for his family and to pay for
all the requirements of a
new baby. However, it is
also fairly obvious that he
works to fill his time, to
give his life s o m e meaning.
'I enjoy myself when I c a n
d o something'.
Essentially, due to a n
u n l u c k y c o i n c i d e n c e , Kurt
is responsible for the near
fatal injury of his s o n . This
undermines all that Kurt
believes in a n d leaves him
with the options of ending
his life or facing up to it's
realities. H e c h o o s e s to
live, and the feelings
imparted by this act are of
hope for the future. Kurt
finally opens his eyes. 'I
can't live an illusion
anymore'. H e leaves his
'Nest'.
The Nest is hampered by
design, the use of a screen
serves to alienate the
audience in a w a y that is
entirely inappropriate.
Relationships are all
important in theatre a n d
The Nest d o e s not give the
feeling that a n y exist, either
between a u d i e n c e a n d
actors, or actors. P e r h a p s
The Nest would have
offered greater insight if
the a p p r o a c h to it's
production had allowed the
actors s p a c e to breath.

a play that they hope to
perform at the forthcoming
w e d d i n g festivities. T h e
characters'and their
situations introduced, the
madness of love's tangled
web takes over reeking
havoc a n d despair. This is
largely due to the servant
of T h e Fairy K i n g w h o
unwittingly, althougth
without initial remorse,
uses the magical powers at
his disposal to make all the
w r o n g people fall in love.
After m u c h upset, a n d use
of further slightly different
magic, mortals and fairies'
love-problems are solved.
However, before all live
happily ever after, the
'actors' perform their play
to the a s s e m b l e d couples.
F i n a l l y all leave to live their
contented existances but
perhaps more urgently to
c o n s u m a t e their marriages.
The use of d a n c e a n d
movement, flowing a n d
released, in conjunction
with m u s i c and other 'vocal
noise', c o m p e l s the
audience not to take their
attention away from the
action for a s e c o n d . T h e
atmospheric lighting of the
simple set serves not to
detract in a n y w a y from the
direction/motivation of the
actors. Essentially the
balance of this production
is perfect.
