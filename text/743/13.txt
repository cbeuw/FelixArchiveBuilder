These do attempt to, in the
words of the Conservative
press release, safeguard
citizens rights. Some of the
sections of the Act, though,
severely erode the citizens
rights. The police are now
able to get a warrant to
search the house or office
of someone who isn't"
suspected of a crime (there
are certain limited
exceptions to this clause
that exempt members of
the caring professions who
keep records as part of
their work eg doctors and
priests). The police are able
to stop and search people
in the street, set up
roadblocks, arrest suspects
and take fingerprints. The
police are able to detain
someone suspected of a
serious offence for four
days (six if over a
weekend) with no right to
see a solicitor for thirty six
hours. Finally the police
have the right to authorise
intimate body searches
(including the anus and the
vagina) of certain suspects.
Again the Labour party
and the Alliance oppose
certain,aspects of the Act.
The Labour party describe
the Act as an attempt to
replace policing by consent
with policing by coercion.
The Labour party is
commited to repeal the Act.
The SDP, though, believes
that such drastic action
would be damaging to the
issue of police powers. It
believes that sections of the
act should be amended.
Again the majority of the
general public have failed
to realise how parts of this
act will affect their rights.
When the Act was passed a
few journalists complained
because they were worried
that the police would get
the right to search their
records to find evidence.
Most of the other sections
of the Act have been
ignored by the media.
Most people haven't
thought about what
happens if the police
decide to hassle someone
they don't like by using the
powers for stop and search
etc repeatedly? What's to
stop the police removing
(by accident of course)
innocent documents about
police brutality while they
search the home of
someone who they suspect
has evidence relating to
another case? What's to
say that suspects won't
make confessions because
they have been held
without seeing their
solicitor for thirty six
hours? Thirty six hours is a
long time to be held in a
hostile environment without
any friendly advice. The
recent case of two
Manchester students who
appear to have been
hassled by certain police
officers for over a year
because they gave
evidence about police
brutality shows that the
police can be very
vindictive when they want
to.
The problem with all
these pieces of legislation
is they assume that the
police are a sort of
superhuman body who are
always decent, honest and
truthful. The unfortunate
fact is they aren't. The
police force is made up of
ordinary people. Nobody
should expect it to be
perfect. Policemen, like any
human, will react badly in
certain situations. They
may well try to gain
revenge. Recent cases of
police brutality show that
policemen may well react
violently to people who
have 'annoyed' them. In the
eighties there are
numerous occasions when
the police are likely to be
'annoyed'. Who can blame
policemen who have been
pelted by stones from
pickets for hours for
becoming 'annoyed'? They
may well have a grudge
against the labour
movement for a long time.
All this is unfortunate but
human nature. The law,
though, should attempt to
minimise the opportunities
for the Police to abuse their
powers to gain revenge. It
should also minimise the
police's opportunities to
use the law for political
reasons. Again the police
are only human. People
who feel strongly about
politics will do a lot to get
their views adopted. Who
can blame a policeman
who uses his powers for
political gain? He shouldn't
be put in a position where
he has the opportunity to
use his powers for political
gain.
In any non-anarchic
society the Police will have
certain powers which they
can abuse or use. A
democratic society should
decide whether the
possible loss of civil libities
is worth the associated
reduction in crime
(assuming there is any).
The new powers have
eroded civil liberties to a
significant extent but
haven't improved the law
and order situation. In my
view law and order will only
improve significantly when
societies problems are
reduced. William Whitelaw
MP summed it up in 1978
when he was Shadow
Home Secretary. He said 'if
boys and girls do not
obtain jobs when they leave
school, they feel that
society has no need of
them. If they feel that, they
do not see any reason why
they should take part in
that society and comply
with its rules'. Society must
attempt to persuade the
young unemployed, who
are almost outside society,
that law and order needs to
be obeyed before our civil
libities are eroded further.
That can't be done with
more repressive laws, it has
to be done by showing that
society cares about all its
members, not just the
people with money and
jobs. The present laws are
an attempt to reduce crime
by making it more difficult
to commit the crime. Will
such tactics may work in
the sort term, in the long
term society will have to
solve the problems that
create crime.
I'm not going to discuss
how society can show that
it cares, that's a political
argument about economics
and this is an article about
civil liberties, I just want to
end by saying that this
article is aimed at getting
you to think about whether
your civil liberties have
been eroded. I believe that
we need a strong police
force. I also, though,
believe that police can 'only
work effectively if they have
the confidence and co-
operation of the public'
(quote from a Conservative
policy document). This
means that police can't be
seen to repressive. They
can't be seen to have
powers that limit our civil
liberties. The police must
be seen to be as faultless
as possible. This I believe
can not come about if they
are having to work with
laws, such as the Criminal
Evidence Act and the
Public Order Bill, which are '
open to abuse.
Release are an organisation who provide an
unbiased source of information for those
arrested. If you get in trouble with the Police
you can contact them on 603 8654 if its an
emergency, alternatively you can ring them for
an appointment on 837 5602. Release also have
very useful cards giving a simple guide to what
to do if you get arrested. These can be
obtained by ringing Release on 837 5602 and
talking to them nicely.
