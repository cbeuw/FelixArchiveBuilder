Squatters May p j j
Libyan diplomats have started
High Court proceedings to have
the squatters evicted from the
former Libyan Consulate in
Princes Gate. An application for
a possession order on the
building was adjourned by Mr
Justice Allot after a brief private
hearing on Tuesday.
F E L I X contacted the Libyan
interest section of the Saudi
Arabian E m b a s s y w h o have
dealt with Libyan interests in
L o n d o n since Britain broke off
diplomatic relations with Libya.
A Libyan diplomat claimed to
know nothing about the court
case a n d said that he didn't
speak to the press. A Foreign
Office official told F E L I X that
they were unaware of the
present position as the building
was no longer a diplomatic
premise because it wasn't used
for diplomatic purposes. H e did
say though, that the Foreign
Office had e n c o u r a g e d the
Saudis to take action as they
thought the squatters were a
nuisance. A s p o k e s m a n for
Department of the Environment,

he knew about the squatters.
F E L I X attempted to contact
the residents o n W e d n e s d a y but
they got no reply w h e n a

Universities Wil Close
Universities will be ciosed if the
Government fails to provide
extra money, Sir Peter
Swinerton-Dyer, C h a i r m a n of
the University Grants
Committee told Vice
C h a n c e l l o r s last week.
Sir Peter told the c h a n c e l l o r s
that no m e m b e r of the U G C
believed 'that the university
system c a n be preserved at its
present size a n d excellence or.
the amount of m o n e y which the
G o v e r n m e n t has said it will
make available', h e added that
recent suggestions of slightly
increased funding for
universities were 'too little a n d
too late'.
Recent huge increases in
rates a n d the prospect of large
pay rises for university staff
meant that the financial
prospects for universities had
c h a n g e d from 'depressing to
disastrous!' a c c o r d i n o to S i r
Pete-
Free!
Sir Peter made reference to
the recent statement that he
would be willing to c o n s i d e r
increased funding for
universities if there w a s real
progress in selectively,
rationalization of small
departments, better financial
management a n d improved
teaching. H e said; that
universities should take the
offer seriously a n d the
qualifications should not be
regarded as rhetoric.
Universities must be more
selective, T h e r e is hardly an
institution which c a n plausibly
say all o u r departments are
equally strong'.
T o be strong departments
must be of a reasonable size, he
said 'closure of small
departments is not only a
means of e c o n o m y ; it is the w a y
to preserve subjects, in
particular small subjects, in
g o o d health.'
Sir Peter said that constant
effort was needed to keep up
teaching standards. H e said all
teachers could not be
charismatic but all had a duty to
be competent.
Stolen
T w o hang gliders were stolen
from outside the Biochemistry
department. David Evans, a
Biochemistry student, left the
hang gliders, w h i c h belonged to
the U n i o n H a n g G l i d i n g C l u b ,

F E L I X they were unaware w h o
had removed the gliders w h i c h
they said were worth
approximately £1000. T h e y said
they had advised M r Evans
about improving his security
arrangements in the future.
