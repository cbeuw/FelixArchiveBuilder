• Parking Notice—would all
Departments inform the Traffic
Wardens if they have visitors or
engineers coming into College. If
possible, Departments concerned
should make available a bay for
them. If this is not possible, the
Traffic Warden will be able to let the
Department know if a space is
available (preferably the day before).
A s all Departments know, there is
only a limited amount of spaces free
for visitors or engineers. This also
avoids visitors or engineers using
other people's bays. IC Ttaffic

necessarily those of the

Departments seem to be
forever trying to a p p e a s e
the seething m a s s e s of
discontented
undergraduates by being
seen to d o a lot but
actually d o i n g very little.
With Elec E n g d o i n g it last
year and P h y s i c s m a k i n g
moves this year, setting up
Undergraduate C o m m o n
R o o m s s e e m s to be a
fashionable way of d o i n g
this. A n d w h y not—the
process p r o d u c e s a lot of
g o o d will a m o n g the
'Student leaders' s i n c e they
are seen to have achieved
s o m e t h i n g , a n d the
;
department usually doesn't
have to s p e n d m u c h m o n e y
or time getting it d o n e . This
is why so many Dep R e p
i candidates this year are
I looking to set s u c h
I c o m m o n rooms up.
J u s t h o w useful are U G
C o m m o n R o o m s t h o u g h ?
T h e y s h o u l d arguably
provide a 'centre for social
activity with the
department', be a place for
U G ' s to gather w h e n not in
lectures, or maybe even act
as study rooms in the
evenings when libraries are
full or not available. But
just how m u c h are the
current s c h e m e s merely
paying lip service to these
reasonable ambitions?
I fear I must now lower
m y cover to an extent and
talk about the s c h e m e for a
' U G c o m m o n r o o m ' in
Physics. A s it stands at the
moment, this involves
carpeting 30 feet of
designated fire e s c a p e
corridor, lining it with seats
(not very many will fit in
the s p a c e — a b o u t 30
maybe) and adding s u c h
salubrious items as potted
plants a n d , to keep one of
the A c c R e p s happy, a
mural! Not a bad little
s c h e m e to s p e n d £2000 on
y o u might think. T h e n yo .
realise that P h y s i c s has
nearly 600
undergraduates—are all of
these meant to fit in the
C o m m o n R o o m — ( Y o u
probably have to stick them
to the ceiling). A s e m i n a r
r o o m at least the size of the
Maths C o m m o n R o o m is
really needed. A n d
C a r p e t i n g ? W h e n you
realise that a coffee
m a c h i n e is plumbed into
the s a m e corridor, a n d
road workers and bus
drivers are frequent
viisitors, I think you'll
realise that the carpet, a
large percentage of the
cost, will not last long.
A n d what will b e c o m e of
this ' C o m m o n R o o m ' ? If
the current incarnation of
the Physics C o m m o n R o o m
is anything to go by,
(another fire corridor on
level 1, larger indeed, than
the planned replacement)
the group of people w h o
s p e n d a lot of time there
will grow up to be termed
objectionable h a c k s by
many and everyone else
will avoid it.
A s I've already d i s c u s s e d
the p r o p o s e d new P h y s i c s
C o m m o n R o o m will not be
as useful to m e m b e r s of
that Department as it.
seems at first sight. Indeed
many of the p r o b l e m s of
the proposed s c h e m e are
obvious, so w h y is the
s c h e m e going a h e a d ? I
have already p r o p o s e d that
the Department views this
as a g o o d away of being
seen to be looking after the
students' interests. F r o m
the Departmental a n d other
Reps' point of view, they
too can be seen to be
achieving something, a n d
£2000 s q u e e z e d out of a
departmental slush fund
looks impressive even if it
is to be spent unwisely.
In this particular case it
can be seen as very g o o d
pre-election publicity for
S i m o n Singh's further
political interests in R C S U
(helping his election to
next years presidency no
end) and b e y o n d . T h e end
result is that the
Department benefit from
appeasing the student reps
a n d the reps benefit from
being seen to have s c r e w e d
money out of the
Department, so helping
their future election
c h a n c e s . A n d the students.
In P h y s i c s at least they'll be
left with a m u c h - t o o - s m a l l
c o m m o n r o o m with a
carpet n o b o d y wants
decorated with an A c c Rep's
amateur artwork and .
none of it working very-
well..
Its e n o u g h to shake y o u r
faith in d e m o c r a c y isn't it?
(What faith..).
