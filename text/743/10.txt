Students
Imperial College students often seem to be isolated from
the outside world. Life for many students appears to
involve problem sheets, Union clubs and drinking. Few
people make the effort to find out about other Colleges.
There are two other Colleges with an International
reputation in South Kensington, the Royal College of Art
and the Royal College of Music, but most students show
little interest in them. In an attempt to improve the
situation FELIX went and investigated the R C M and the
RCA.
Royal College Of Music
The Royal C o l l e g e of M u s i c
is that odd Victorian
Building situated between
the R S M building and the
C h e m i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g
department. It has about
600 students, 120 of w h o m
are postgraduates, w h o are
mainly studying for the
A R C M , a d i p l o m a with
degree status although
s o m e are studying for
degrees. Most of their
students stay at the C o l l e g e
i for three or four years • S u e G o r t o n
although s o m e stay for a
considerably longer period.
T h e R C M Students
A s s o c i a t i o n is the
organisation that
represents R C M students
and organise social events.
President S u e G o r t o n , a
singer who has been at the
college for five years, said
that the R C M S A tries to
concentrate on organising
n o n - m u s i c a l events s u c h as
football, pool and drama.
They had problems,
though, because most R C M
students live a long way
from the C o l l e g e . R C M
students have worse
problems than most
students living in L o n d o n
when they start looking for
a c o m m o d a t i o n b e c a u s e
many landlords try to stop
music students rehearsing.
Miss G o r t o n said that there
were students living in
Guildford b e c a u s e they
couldn't find anywhere
nearer to live.
T h e R C S M A is also
restricted to organising
c h e a p events b e c a u s e R C M
Students have been hit
badly by the cuts. T h e
removal of the travel
subsidy has made
a c c o m m o d a t i o n problems
worse. O n e has little m o n e y
when one has to travel
from Guildford. T h e
C o l l e g e has also been
badly hit by cuts. C u t s to
C o l l e g e funding have
meant that extra lessons
that many students used to
take have been cut.
Like IC students, most
R C M students take very
little notice of their
neighbours. M u s i c i a n s ,
a c c o r d i n g to M s G o r t o n ,
o n l y think about other
musicians. T h e y only
notice IC students when
the R C M canteen is full of
IC students. This doesn't
mean, t h o u g h , that the
U n i o n s don't get o n . M s
G o r t o n said she had
d i s c u s s i o n s with next year's
I C U President Christine
Taig about more joint
social events. T h e R C M will
probably be represented at
next year's Fresher's Fair.
S h e e n c o u r a g e d IC
students to form links. 'IC
Students are w e l c o m e to
c o m e to anything we do'.
Royal College Of Art
The Royal C o l l e g e of Art is
based in the modern office
block in J a y M e y s (that's
beind Beit and next to the
Albert Hall). A l t h o u g h they
have buildings in other
parts of South K e n s i n g t o n .
The college is entirely
postgraduate. It has about
600 students w h o are
studying for M A s or P h D s .
They are mainly funded by
grants from the Department
of E d u c a t i o n and Science.
The C o l l e g e has c h a n g e d
radically in the last two or
three years. T h e Rector
J o c e y l n Stevens, the former
boss of E x p r e s s
Newspapers, has set out to
make the C o l l e g e more
c o m m e r c i a l l y m i n d e d . H e
has introduced central
funding so that
departments are no longer
free to d e c i d e how they
s p e n d money they raise
from outside sources. H e
has cut fine art c o u r s e s and
introduced courses
designed to satisfy
industry. A s a result the
Department of E d u c a t i o n
and S c i e n c e w h i c h funds
the R C A directly has given
the R C A level funding in
real terms.
R C A U n i o n President
Tim Foster, w h o was a
student in Industrial
Design, a course run jointly
by IC and the R C A before
b e c o m i n g a sabbatical, said
that the way the a p p r o a c h
of the C o l l e g e to
c o m m e r i c a l i s i n g itself was
probably right in the long
term. It was, though,
causing tremendous
problems to students in the
short term.
T h e R C A U n i o n is a
small one with, at present,
no c l u b s or societies. This
is mainly b e c a u s e all the
• T i m Foster
students are apathetic
postgraduates and have to
work hard. T h e U n i o n does,
though, run a bar and
refectory. It also provide
Ents with D i s c o s every
Thursday.
Most R C A students think
that IC students are 'dead
boring'. A s a result they
have very few links with IC.
Even students on the joint
courses are glad to be at
the R C A . T h e R C A U n i o n
has very little contact with
IC U n i o n . Mr Forster said
the only time he'd met
people from IC union was
when F E L I X had been to
visit him. He said, though,
that he was surprised that
I C U were still outside N U S .
He said he didn't see what
I C U gains from being
outside.
Mr Foster, though,
e n c o u r a g e d IC studnets to
use the R C A ' s facilities.
'Don't be put off by the
idea that we may be arty
farty!' He said 'many of our
students are very
mercenary doing jobs for
c o m m e r c e ' . H e e n c o u r a g e d
IC students to go to the
T h u r s d a y disco.
