Indians practice, but it is
important to eat them at
the same meal. Amino
acids are not stored for
long, and if they are not
soon converted into
protein, they are broken
down and excreted. So
sweetcorn for lunch and
wheat for dinner will not
give the same nutritional
requirement. It is obviously
important to ensure that
the correct amino acid
balance is eaten for good
health. The problem
becomes even more critical
for Vegans. Unfortunately,
animal products have a
better balance than plant
products. With wise and
informed eating however,
the amino acid deficiences
can be minimised.
However, it is wise to note
that women who are
Vegans, are often advised
to eat wider varieties of
food when pregnant, in
order to avoid severe
deficiencies and foetal
malformations, the advice
usually being to include at
least some dairy products
during gestation.
The comment about
peanuts being a good
source of protein is also
slightly incorrect. Whilst
the protein content of such
nuts is high, it is bound in
a complex way, such that it
is largely indigestible once
eaten so the gain is very
much lower than would
appear. This problem
comes in part from the
methods used to quantify
the nutritional content of
foods. These are all carried
out chemically, usually
under severe conditions
whilst the content may be
as analysed, the ease with
which an individual's
digestive system can
recover these nutrients is
widely variable, a fact often
forgotten by nutritionalists.
Although enzymes are
wonderful things, they do
not always produce the
same results as extreme
chemical modification. It is
also well known that
individuals often have an
enzyme defiency through
genetic reasons, and given
the complexities of the
digestion and metabolic
processes, it is likely that
we all differ from each
other in at least a few
enzymes.
Finally, beer! This
actually can be quite
nutritional, since the
alcohol provides energy,
and it also appears to act
as a solvent for fats and
therefore (in moderation)
could be likely to lead to a
reduction in the risk of
heart disease. It can also
provide protein, but more
importantly, essential
vitamins and minerals in
surprisingly large amounts.
It is important to note,
however, that the
nutritional value is largely
lost with excessive filtering
and pasteurisation, as
occurs with lagers. So the
best thing is to drink
Guinness or real ales, and
cut out the lagers and keg
bitters!
Above all, eating must be
'carried out sensibly, but
provide plenty of variety.
The old adage, 'A little of
what you fancy does you
good' is certainly near the
nub of the matter.

We, the undersigned
students and youth
organisations in Britain,
strongly condemn the
recent massacre of
students at al-Yarmouk
University in Jordan by
your Security forces. We
also condemn the
continuing campaign of
arrests against the
democractic forces in
Jordan including prominent
patriots, trade unionists
and students.
There is deep concern
for their lives, gravely
threatened by the
conditions of detention and
interrogation at the hands
of your Security forces.
We hold your
Government fully
responsible for the cold-
blooded murder of fellow
students in Jordan, and
demand:
• The immediate halt of the
campaign of arrests and
repression and the release
of all students and political
detainees.
• The immediate
withdrawal from the
Univeristy campus of all
Security forces and agents.
• The reinstatement of al!
students expelled from al-
Yarmouk University, and an
end to all forms of
harassemnt and
persecution.
• an immediate public
inquiry into this horrendous
crime and the punishments
of its perpetrators, whose
hands are stained with the
blood of innocent students.
