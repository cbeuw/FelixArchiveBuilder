OK, I got it wrong, the start
of the World Cup has not
been quite as exciting as I
predicted last week.
Yesterday's game between
England and Portugal (I'm
writing this at 8pm on
Wednesday evening) was one
of the worst games of football
I've seen in a long time. The
problem seems to be the heat.
All the teams seem to be
playing at half speed. I really
wonder if they should have
given thefinalsto Mexico
when one looks at the poor
TV coverage and the terrible
heat. Don't worry, though, the
i I
work. Hockney is there as are
hundreds of less well known.
There are several offers for IC
students interested in going.
The old students associations
have organised a special
showing, a buffet and music
from the IC Orchestra string
quintet. Tickets are £12.50
which is excellent value for
what should be a very special
evening. The event is on July
11th so if you're interested
contact the Old Students
Association offices. If you can't
afford the Old Students event,
WH Smith have sponsored a
series of concerts at the Royal
twrti
football will get better. This
week we've got some excellent
games coming up. Game of
the week is probably Scotland
v West Germany (Sunday, BBC
7pm). At the time of writing
Scotland haven't played and
West Germany have drawn
with Uruguay 1-1. The West
Germans, though, looked to
me the best team I've seen so
far in the competition. They
managed to overcome the heat
and look threateningforall of
the game. England play twice
but to be honestfollowinglast
nights debacle I'm not sure
that I'll be watching. I've got
better things to do then watch
a gme of football that's likely
to be as exciting as paint
drying. For those patriots who
are interested England play
Morocco (Friday, ITV 11pm)
and Poland (Wednesday, BBC
11pm). One other game that
will be worth watching is
Uruguay v Denmark (Sunday,
ITV 11pm).
Before I get too depressed
about the problems with the
World Cup I'd better return
to what's on in London. One
of the features of the summer
is the Royal Academy
Summer Exhibition. Amateur
and professional artists get the
chance to show their best new-
Academy. For £3 you get the
opportunity to listen to some
of the best classical music
going and to view the
exhibition. The concerts are
on Thursdays between 26th
June and 17th July. These
concerts are highly
recomended. You can find
more details by ringing Youth
and Music on 01-379 6722.
Returning to more
conventional Capital Ideas
Saturday seems to be a good
day for going to a gig.
Desmond Dekker (you know
the guy who did Isrealites) is
playing the Sir George Robey.
So if you fancy some good
reggae/ska then get up to
Islington for some crucial
rhythms. On the subject of
Ska, Bad Manners play the
Lord Cecil on the same night.
Bad Manners have got to be
one of the all-time best dance
bands. If you want something
a little more relaxed, Mint
Juleps play the Half Moon on
Saturday. Mint Julips are one
of the brilliant new vocal
bands that seem to have
sprung up. All in all if the feet
are tapping the night away on
Saturday you'll only have
yourself to blame.
To be honest there are
virtually no other decent gigs
coming up in the near future.
Never mind I suppose things
must improve. When they do,
though, I'll be out of London
so I suppose I'm not going to
benefit. Its typical really.
Generally London seems a
little dead at the moment.
England are playing India in
the test match at Lords and to
be honest this is the only event
that I fancy going to (other
than the musical events
lisited). England have got to
win this match if David Gower
is to remain as captain. To be
honest I don't think he
deserves to stay. His
performance in the West
Indies was a disgrace. Unlike
Mike Gatting he seems to have
no pride for England. He
hardly seems to try when he
leads an England team.
One final Capital Idea.
Why not go and see some
opera? The English National
Opera and the Royal Opera
are two of the world's leading
opera companies and its not
that expensive to go and see
them. Opera conjures up
images of dinner jackets and
funny singing. It is, though,
amazingly powerful and
romantic. Why don't you go
once before you slag it off.
Anyway I'd better stop
writing. The more I write the
worse my style becomes. I
hope though I've given you
some ideas about what to do
when those exams are over.
