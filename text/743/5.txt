The Week In
Time Out Meets Tomorrow's World
Thymus Key To
AIDS Vaccine?
Research published last
week in Science shows a
possible leap forward in the
fight against acquired
immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS). The
AIDS Virus attacks T-
lymphocyte cells, special
white block cells that are
part of the immune system.
There is unfortunate
confusion about T-
lymphocyte cells, even
among the scientific
population (Letters, 30
May). White blood cells are
produced in the bone
marrow: lymphocytes are
also produced in the
spleen, the lymph nodes
and the thymus. (The
thymus, as every O-level
biologist knows, is a gland
found in the root of the
neck, mostly under the
cover of the upper part of
the sternum: it consists
largely of developing
lymphocytes.) Bone

Hippo Scheme
Students at California
Institute of Technology
don't seem to think much
of SDI, the so-called Star
Wars project. In April they
held a competition to see
who could propose the
most 'destabilising,
unworkable, or incredibly
expensive' scheme to
than air.
Under imminent enemy
attack, the animals would
be released from the cage
to form an optically thick
cascade of buoyant hippos.
When the mean hippo
density became equal to
the atmospheric density
(hyppopause), the hippos
achieve SDI's goals
{Nature, 22 May).
The winning entry came
from student Greg
Ojakangas, who suggests
developing a genetically
engineered strain of pygmy
hippopotamus. The animals
would be fed on a diet rich
in radioactive materials,
and then placed in cages
containing cathodes. A
continuous stream of
electrons would convert the
alpha-particles radiated by
the hippos' food into
helium. The hippos would
gradually inflate with
helium, becoming lighter
would provide Readily
Operative Overhead
Protection by Hippos
(ROOPH). The hippos
would slowly deflate,
floating gently back to
earth after two days, when
they could be collected
and, presumably,
reprocessed.
It is estimated that the
scheme would cost $457
million: all enquiries to IC

lymphocytes are termed B-
cell lymphocytes. Thymus-
derived lymphocytes are
termed T-cell lymphocytes.
T-cells attack antigens
directly at close range only;
B-cells attack antigens by
secreting antibodies.
A hormone of the
thymus, called thymosin,
helps to regulate T-cells.
With most immune-
deficiency diseases, levels
of thymosin are depressed,
but researchers at the
George Washington
University, US, have found
what appeared to be high
levels of thymosin in more
than half of the AIDS
patients they examined.
The explanation that the
researchers put forward is
that a protein of the AIDS
virus closely resembles
thymosin. This might
explain why the immune
system is unable to cope
with AIDS; antibodies that
attack the viral protein may
also attack thymosin, a
suggestion supported by
the observation that AIDS
patients suffer considerable
damage to the thymus.
The theory has been
tested by injecting rabbits
with a synthetic version of
the hormone thymosin. The
rabbits' immune systems
were found to produce
antibodies against the
hormone: the hope was
that these antibodies would
also act against the protein
at the core of the AIDS
virus in-humans. The
results are encouraging:
the rabbit antibodies
reduced viral replication in
the infected human cells by
more than one-half. When
the antibody was mixed
with an immunoglobulin,
levels of viral proteins were
significantly reduced, and
production of reverse
transcriptase (See FELIX,
16 May) was halted.
The catch is that
thymosin itself might evoke
a similiar response, and
cause the body to attack
the thymus, warn the
researchers.
