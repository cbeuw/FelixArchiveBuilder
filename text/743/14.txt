Pimlico Connection Soc-
iety is recruiting tutors for
next year 1986-7 to help in
classrooms at local
comprehensive schools.
Our tutors help the
teachers in their practical
lessons on Wednesday
afternoons during the
autumn term and for the
first four weeks of the
spring term.
This year about eighty
students went into
classrooms to help in
science, mathematics and
computing with pupils of
most ages
If you are interested then
please contact Richard
Bleasdale E E 3, Keith Bell
Chem Eng 3 or David
Berry, Dept of Humanities.
Leaflets and recruitment
forms can also be picked
up from outside rm 510
Electrical Eng.
For people interested in
any aspect of the society
we shall be having a small,
free introductory lunch,
cheese and biscuits etc, in
Elec Eng 606 at 1pm on
10th June 1986.
During the last weeks of
term we are also arranging
visits to the schools
involved.
Gliding
Flying This Summer
Now that exams are nearly
I over, we can get back to
the serious things in life
like flying. The annual
barbecue will be held at
Lasham on Saturday 14th
June, which also marks the
start of our fly-in week. To
arrange transport and fir;'!
out details turn up at
Thursday's night's meeting.
A course is being run for
pre-solo pilots and the
casual list will also be
running for people who
can't get on the course. For
the more advanced pilots it
is hoped to stage a repeat
of the very successful race
to Yoster Airfield. This time
however Burdett is barred
from taking part due to his
totally incompetent
navigation last
time—fetching up at Brize
Norton heading in totally
the wrong direction.
From the end of term
Thursday night meetings
will cease, but the club
continues functioning at
Lasham. It is usually very
quiet mid-week, so turn up
and get lots of hours
soaring in. Even at
'weekends during the
summer you should be able
o get all the flying you
.. ant due to the revised IC
ballot rules. For those not
going on the tour to Italy
remember that the Libelle
and ASW-19 will be away
from Lasham during July,
(though the Ka-8 is being
left behind so there will be
one glider to fly).
Finally congratulations to
Jon Towill for making a
70km flight to complete his
silver C, to Pete Placard for
learning how to soar and to
all those who have gone
solo this year. Those who
haven't soloed yet pull your
fingers out during the
summer. See you in the air.

Famous Three In Action
The 'famous three' were
again in action last
weekend, whilst everybody
else was busy sweating
over textbooks in
preparation for exams
(haven't they finished yet?).
Anyway, Scott Heyhoe and
Peter Hartigan were racing
at Eastway last Sunday,
and Peter excelled in
gaining fifth place in the
3rd and vets event, scoring
2 points on his licence and
winning £2 for his efforts.
Wayne Morley performed
well also last Saturday, in a
30 mile TT at Witham,
Essex. His time of 1-19-05
was achieved in apalling
conditions, and represents
his first ride at the distance
All clubs are
asked to clear
their pigeon
holes in the
Union Office. Any
club not doing so
will have their
stuff thrown in
the pin.
