W i n e Tasting C h a i r m a n
Mark Masento said 'It is sad
that although IC Wine
Tasting Society has Droved
itself to be one of the best
and most successful c l u b s
in the country, and has a
c h a n c e to make the
C o l l e g e known worldwide,
the U n i o n deem us
unworthy of their full
support.'
ULU VP Attacked
A n d y Ravenscroft,
University of L o n d o n U n i o n
( U L U ) Vice President-
Services, narrowly avoided
having his report to
General University C o u n c i l
( G U C ) rejected on T u e s d a y
Mr Ravenscrof; was
criticised for c o m m e n t i n g
in his report that U L U was
a politically ineffectual
body that should
concentrate on looking
after students' interests and
services. There was also
criticism, mainly from V i c e
President-elect (Finance
and Administration) Nick
Wilkins, of plans to build a
new bar on the fourth floor
of the U L U Building. He
said other ideas s u c h as re-
siting the A c c o m m o d a t i o n
Office, s h o u l d have priority.
tAndy Ravenscroft
Free Speech
An amendment to the
Education Act that w o u l d
have given university staff
and students a legal duty to
uphold freedom of s p e e c h
has been withdrawn. A
s p o k e s m a n for the
Department of E d u c a t i o n
and S c i e n c e told F E L I X
that there had been
problems with drafting. H e
said, though, that the
amendment wag likely to be
reintroduced.
T h e amendment was
intended to outlaw the 'no
platform' policies that many
student unions have
adopted. T h e amendment
would not have made these
policies illegal but it would
have been open to a n y o n e
to take out an injunction to
prevent a breach of the law.
Star Wars
Up to twelve British
universities have submitted
proposals for 'Star Wars'
research, a c c o r d i n g to an
article in last Friday's
T i m e s Higher Educational
Supplement.
Imperial C o l l e g e
departments are
understood to have
submitted applications for
the work despite opposition
from groups within the
C o l l e g e particularly in the
C o m p u t i n g department.
Other groups w h o are
believed to have submitted
applications are Heriot-
Watt, U M I S T , Brunei,
Cranfield Institute and T h e
S c i e n c e and Engineering
Research C o u n c i l ' s
Rutherford Appleton
Laborartory.
GUC
A motion went to G U C
(General U n i o n C o u n c i l ) on
T u e s d a y to adopt the
'Student Charter' on
experiments involving
animals. T h e motion was
n o : in the event discussed,
but if p a s s e d at the next
meeting of G U C , will
declare each student's right
to c h o o s e whether to
participate in experiments
involving cruelty, without
suffering any a c a d e m i c
penalty for that cnoice.
Vandalism
Students vandalised severa!
large flower pots in Princes
G a r d e n s last w e e k e n d . T h e
Students overturnec tne
pots which are on the path
on the West side of the
G a r d e n . Estates official,
J o h n Rees appealed to
students not to vandalise
the gardens. He said the
vandalism had upset the
gardener and made the
G a r d e n s look less
attractive. C o l l e g e Security
have instructed the
Southside guards to watch
for vandalism in the
G a r d e n s . A n y o n e caught
vandalising the G a r d e n s
will be disciplined.
Big Spenders
University s c i e n c e
departments s p e n d more of
their University Grants
C o m m i t t e e ( U G C ) grant on
research than other classes
of department. A c c o r d i n g
to a survey by a former
Deputy C h a i r m a n of the
U G C , Professor Keith
C l a y t o n of the University of
East A n g l i a , s c i e n c e
departments s p e n d 55% of
their U G C allocation on
research.
T h e survey was
c o m m i s s i o n e d by the
Department of Education
and S c i e n c e to 'provide a
clear idea of the resources
being devoted to research .
a c r o s s all the sectors of
higher education'.
Collection
West L o n d o n C h a p l a i n c y
raised over Â£720 during the
recent Christian A i d Week
collection by collecting
round the halls and by
collecting outside the
Albert Hall with a barrel
organ. The C h a p l a i n c y
would like to thank
everyone w h o contributed.
Colours
Recreational C l u b s
Committee ( R C C )
C h a i r m a n T i m Palmer has
proposed a motion for
Joint C o u n c i l that Athletics
Half C o l o u r s s h o u l d be
awarded to students who
c o m p e t e for Imperial as
m e m b e r s of c l u b s that are
outside Athletic C l u b s

believes that the s u c c e s s e s
of clubs like Wine Tasting
should be rewarded with
Athletics Half C o l o u r s .
