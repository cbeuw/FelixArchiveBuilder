§I Law And Order:
S Has It Eroded Your
Civil Liberties?
I Over the last few years the Conservative government have
I started to pass considerable changes in the criminal law.
These changes will significantly affected our rights as
British residents. The Conservatives claim that these new
laws significantly improve the police's chances of keeping
law and order but how serious are the effects on our civil
rights? in this opinion article Hugh Southey looks at the
effect of these new laws
All the major political
parties agree that crime is
growing at an alarming
rate. S i n c e 1979, w h e n the
Conservative party c a m e to
power, riots have b e c o m e a
feature of inner city life, the
number of offences
recorded by the police has
g o n e up by 41%, violent
crime has g o n e up by 40%
etc, etc. T h i s isn't meant to
be a criticism of the
Conservative government,
crime was rising at an
alarming rate w h e n L a b o u r
were in power, its meant to
illustrate the problems
facing the Government. All
the political parties agree
the need for c h a n g e s in the
law to c o p e with increased
criminal activity. T h e y don't
agree how this c h a n g e
should be achieved.
W h e n the Conservatives
c a m e to power in 1979,
they decided to boost the
police in an attempt to
control the law and order
problem. T h e Conservatives
have increased expenditure
on the police by more than
a third in real terms, police
manpower has increased
by over 13,000 and police
pay has increased by
111.1%. This, though, has
really failed to control
crime. The figures
mentioned earlier s h o w that
law and order is still a
major problem. T h e annual
promises that are made at
Conservative party
conferences to improve law
and order s h o w that the
Conservatives are worried.
In an attempt to support
the police in their efforts,
the Conservatives started to
pass new laws. By the time
you return to C o l l e g e in
O c t o b e r the P u b l i c O r d e r
Bill is likely to have
b e c o m e law. This and the
Police and Criminal
Evidence A c t are the
Conservative's attempts at
legislation. T h e effect they
will have on the crime rates
is, at present, difficult to
gauge. The effect they will
have on civil libities is very
serious.
T h e P u b l i c O r d e r Bill is
an attempt to control mass
lawlessness. T h e eighties
has seen n u m o r o u s large
scale battles between the
police and the public.
Battles at Brixton,
Orgreave, S t o n e h e n g e and
football grounds, city
centres and picket lines all
over the country have been
a feature of law and order
since the present
government have c o m e to
power. Most people would
agree that situations like
these have got to be
prevented. Whether you
believe the pickets or the
police c a u s e d the trouble at
W a p p i n g , mass riots, s u c h
as the one outside the
N e w s International plant,
have got to be prevented.
Society can not tolerate the
number of injuries that
o c c u r on s u c h o c c a s i o n s .
T h e Conservatives have set
out to ban events that
might end in a riot. T h e y
have given the police the
right to control the size,
location and duration of
static demonstrations and
meetings. T h e y have given
the police the right to
impose restrictions on
m a r c h e s if they fear
'serious disruption to the
local c o m m u n i t y ' or 'the
c o e r c i o n of the individual'.
T h e y require the organisers
of marches to give the
police seven days notice of
any march. T h e y have
tightened the law on
incitement of racial hatred.
T h e y have created a new
offence of disorderly
conduct. Finally they have
given the police the power
to ban specific marches.
M a n y groups, including
the Labour Party and the
Alliance, have o p p o s e d
parts of this Bill. G r o u p s
are already threatening to
organise mass illegal
demonstrations to protest
against this legislation. O n e
group has already
advertised for people to
agree to act as organisers
of an illegal demonstration.
T h e idea of this is that a
large number of people will
reply and agree to act as
organisers so that the
police have to arrest
millions of organisers.
Trade U n i o n s are
protesting because they
fear that they will lose their
right to organise large
demonstrations that s h o w
the labour movements
solidarity with strikers.
Pressure groups are also
worried that they will lose
their right to protest
b e c a u s e the police will
decide that the
demonstration disrupts the
local comunity (even
though a significant
proportion of the local
comunity may want to
protest).
Ordinary m e m b e r s of the
public, though, remain
ignorant of the worrying
implications of this act. T h e
press (particularly the
tabloid press) haven't
c o n s i d e r e d the important
civil liberties questions that
the Bill poses. Is it more
important that you have a
right to demonstrate about
things that worry y o u or
that the o d d event likely to
cause trouble is b a n n e d ? Is
it important that you have
the right to demonstrate
about an issue of
immediate c o n c e r n (the
new law would prevent
s p o n t a n e o u s
demonstrations w h e n mass
redundancies are
a n n o u n c e d for example)?
Is the ban really going to
have any effect w h e n the
sort of people w h o go to
demonstrations that may
end in trouble are unlikely
to take any notice of a
'repressive' police ban (the
troubles in Northern Ireland
have s h o w n that bans on
marches have very little
effect w h e n people are out
to c a u s e trouble)? C o u l d
the police ban events which
are on the political fringes
but unlikely to end in
trouble? C o u l d the police
ban events like S t o n e h e n g e
w h i c h have had a bad •
press? Last year the police
s m a s h e d up the P e a c e
c o n v o y while it was on its
way to S t o n e h e n g e . T h e s e
people weren't out for
trouble. Everyone knows
that hippys are peaceful
people. M a n y of the hippys
had their families. T h e y
wanted to go to a peaceful
rock concert. T h e police,
though, attacked the hippys
because, in my view, the
tabloid media had created a
myth of drug crazed violent
hippys rampaging through
the South West of E n g l a n d .
W h y shouldn't these people
hold a pop concert
providing they don't break
any laws like trespass? At
present the Police can only
have the hippies evicted
from a particular site if the
landlord obtains a court
order. If the Public O r d e r
Bill is passed the Police will
be able to ban the
S t o n e h e n g e festival.
T h e Police A n d Criminal
A c t is very different to the
Public O r d e r Bill.
A c c o r d i n g to a
Conservative Party press
release it seeks to
modernise and clarify
police powers and
safeguard the citizens
powers. T h e law is a very
complicated and long piece
of legislation. M a n y of the
sections of the act are only
attempts to clear up the
very complicated and
c o n f u s i n g case law that
governs police procedure.
