Libya
It looks as though the
squatters are s o o n to be
evicted from the L i b y a n
Consulate. Students in
L o n d o n have an almost
impossible task w h e n they
start looking for
a c c o m m o d a t i o n .
A c c o m m o d a t i o n is either
massively over priced or
disgusting or both. There
are .though, in L o n d o n ,
m a n y large empty buildings
w h i c h c o u l d be used to
a c c o m m o d a t e y o u n g
people. T h e Libyan
consulate is a perfect
example. It c o u l d be used
for a c c o m m o d a t i o n but the
Libyan interest section of
the S a u d i A r a b i a n E m b a s s y
s e e m s determined to keep
the building empty. T h e
G o v e r n m e n t s h o u l d be
e n c o u r a g i n g y o u n g people
to squat rather than
e n c o u r a g i n g foreign
e m b a s s e y s to evict them.

The University Grants
C o m m i t t e e has a difficult
job. T h e y are trying to
guard standards in the
university sector while the
G o v e r n m e n t makes savage
cuts to their funding. Sir
Peter S w i n n e r t o n - D y e r ' s
recent statements have
been a m a z i n g l y realistic
about the problems facing
the universities. H e has
â€¢ attempted to draw attention
to the p r o b l e m s facing
higher education. T h e
Government, t h o u g h ,
s e e m s prepared to ignore
his warning. T h e only way
that the government c a n be
made to c h a n g e its policies
is if the middle classes w h o
make up a significant
proportion of Tory support
realise the d a m a g e the
G o v e r n m e n t is d o i n g . M a n y
of these Tory voters are
parents of university
students. T h e universities
s h o u l d try a n d inform these
parents about the p r o b l e m s
they are facing. V i c e
C h a n c e l l o r s of several
universities, including
D u r h a m , have written to
parents informing them of
the problems cuts are
causing. T o r y voting
parents take notice of s u c h
letters and write to their
M P s . I don't understand
why the Rector doesn't
write to parents. It wouldn't
cost m u c h and w o u l d be an
excellent way of
persuading the G o v e r n m e n t
to c h a n g e its policies.
R C M and R C A
O n page ten of this issue
you'll see a feature on the
R C A a n d the R C M . Both of
these c o l l e g e s have
facilities that are open to IC
students. W h y not try a n d
get involved with t h e m ? It's
ridiculous that we s h o u l d
all be students in S o u t h
K e n s i n g t o n yet we hardly
mix. It w o u l d be great to
get the other c o l l e g e s
involved with IC s o that w e
can c h a n g e the social life
slightly by m a k i n g it more
artistic. T h i s may seem
stupid but w h y not g o to
one R C M or R C A event?

Setting The
Record Straight
Dear H u g h ,
I was most c o n c e r n e d that
Professor B l o w (Letters,
last week) should have
interpreted the remarks in
my annual report as an
attack on the
Undergraduate Studies
C o m m i t t e e ( U S C ) . Let me
make it clear that I think
the committee is c o m p o s e d
of a c a d e m i c s w h o d o care
about teaching, a n d that
they have all put a great
deal of effort into its work. I
apologise if I gave a
different impression in m y
report.
Perhaps I s h o u l d explain
more fully the points I was
making in the sections
referred to by Prof Blow.
W h e n I said that the report
was being 'watered d o w n ' I
didn't mean that
unauthorized c h a n g e s were
being made, but that,
c o n s c i o u s l y or
u n c o n s c i o u s l y , the more
radical ideas were being
softened to increase their
acceptability to the B o a r d
of Studies ( B O S ) this is not
the fault of the U S C , but a
product of their realistic
assessment of the aptitudes
of the wider body of their
colleagues. It was to this
wider body that my s e c o n d
paragraph referred, not to
the U S C , w h o s e m e m b e r s I
w o u l d specifically e x c l u d e
from the charge.
In the report I also
expressed disappointment
that it did not prove
possible to produce a
report earlier in the year.
The fact the U S C ' s first
report will be c o n s i d e r e d
by B O S in the s u m m e r
vacation inevitably reduces
its impact, on students at
least. I think this is
unfortunate, since it
deserves the fullest
possible debate, as Prof
B l o w points out in his
letter. I did present a
g l o o m y view of the
prospects of significant
"hanges as a result of the
U S C ' s first report. This I
still stand by after reading
the report now it has been
published. I feel that even if
it is a c c e p t e d the worst
department will safely be
able to ignore many of its
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s , whilst
the more enlightened
departments are already
putting many of them into
effect. However, this is not
to say that the p r o c e s s is
not valuable. It is
undoubtedly a step in the
right direction, and will
hopefully result in gradual
improvements and
increased awareness of the
problems, even if
immediate c h a n g e s are not
forthcoming.
My final poteit is that this
must be the beginning of a
longer process, rather than
a once-and-for-all step, a
fact w h i c h I am sure Prof
B l o w is well aware of.
Yours sincerely,
J Martin Taylor

Eating Our Words
Dear H u g h ,
Y o u r feature article last
week about food and
nutrition was most
interesting but contained
many i n a c c u r a c i e s .
Firstly, it concentrated
too m u c h on modern fads,
s u c h as keeping y o u r
saturated fat content low,
and eating lots of fibre.
A d e q u a t e fibre levels can
be maintained just as easily
by eating a correct portion
of vegetable and fruits as
by sprinkling everything
with Bran. C h o l e s t e r o l is a
sterol and not a fat, being
derived in the body from
Acetyl C o e n z y m e A, w h i c h
is formed from
C a r b e h y d r a t e s as well as
fats. There are several
types of cholesterol, only
one of w h i c h is thought to
be associated with heart
diesease. Saturated fat
levels and heart disease are
still o p e n to debate, but at
least they are naturally
p r o d u c e d , unlike
margarines, w h i c h go
through m a n y c h e m i c a l
processes, with the
addition of vitamins to
make them more like
butter.
Bread is actually a g o o d
s o u r c e of p r o t e i n L
containing between 12 to
17% (even white bread!), s o
Chris' H a m B a p gives him
more than the protein from
the ham. However, bread,
flour a n d most other grains
are quite importantly
deficient in Lysine, and the
content of one or two other
essential a m i n o acids is
also significantly lower. It is
a pity that protein was not
mentioned in any depth in
the article, particularly with
the current popularity of
vegetarianism amongst
students. O n e of the best
ways of o v e r c o m i n g a m i n o
acid deficiencies is to eat a
mixture of both grains
(wheat being most
c o m m o n ) a n d sweetcorn,
since the deficiencies tend
to largely c a n c e l each other
out. T h i s is what Central
and S o u t h A m e r i c a n
