Theatrel
James Saunders is a most
prolific playwright. Since
Alas, Poor Fred was written
in 1959, he has composed
numerous scripts for
theatre, radio and
television, perhaps his most
famous stage production
being Next Time I'll Sing to
You first performed in 1963.
For the Umoja Theatre
Company's new
production, director
Carmen Munroe has
chosen Saunders' most
cherished protagonists: the
married couple.
Saunders' play takes the
form of a dialogue between
Mr and Mrs Pringle, an
elderlycouple living in a '
small detached council
house. They are an
argumentative pair. Mr
Pringle is aggressive and
disagreeable; Mrs Pringle,
calmly assertive as they

together their relation to
Fred, a mysterious
shadowy character, lost in
the back of their memories.
For Mr Pringle, Fred might
never have existed at all,
for his recollections are a
distracted montage of other
Just when you may have
considered car chases to
be a boring cliche two films
have come out recently
which may put them on the
road to a comeback, The
Hitcher reviewed last week
and To Live and Die in LA.
The latter has been
compared to Miami Vice,
but this is most unfair on
the film which is far more
sophisticated and
impressive than the
television programme,
although it does have some
similarities. Both Miami
Vice and To Live and Die in
LA involve a crime busting
partnership in parts of the
world but where they differ
is in the portrayal of their
subjects, the former is
often rather clumsy and
unimaginative storytelling
and frequently little more
than an overly long pop
video, whereas the latter
has some very imaginative
editing of both sound and
vision. Further in the
television programme, for
all it's stylised violence,
somehow people don't
seem to get hurt; in the film
you really can feel when
someone gets beaten up.
The partnership in the
film initially consists of an
older agent who wants one
last big bust of a famous
counterfeiter before retiring
and a younger more
ambitous man, William L
Peterson. In trying to
secure the arrest single
handed the elder man is
killed. His partner is then
determined to catch the evil
lawbreaker, played in a
little too exaggerated
manner by Willem Dafoe,
using whatever means he
can. To assist him and
replace his former partner
he is reluctantly assigned a
younger more moral agent,
whose dilemmas and tears
are very convincingly
portrayed.

Continuing the theme of
action movie brings me to
Biggies. Oh dear. In
attempting to portray
Biggies seriously and avoid
making another spoof,
Biggies has been relegated
to a supporting role for a
young modern American,
yes, modern. The film
makers believed, possibly
with good reason that
modern audiences would
not be able to swallow a
straight Biggies film so
they had the wacky idea of
making a fast food
manufacturer Biggies' time
twin, which seems to me to
be an idea which is about
as digestible as the TV
Dinners the young hero
sells.
However in trying to
appeal to a greater
audience the film fails to hit
it's target (in fact it doesn't
even wing the blighter) and
in spite of Neil Dickson,
(who makes an excellent
Biggies), the impressive
stunt flying and the fact
that an old .school friend of
mine plays Ginger I can't
really rate this film very
peoples faces and lives. Yet
his wife's love of Fred, and
her intimate knowledge of
his habits and his
appearance is an often
spoken but soon forgotten
secret between them.
The play draws heavily
from lonesco, Beckett and
Pinter for its, effect, so
closely, in fact, as to be
almost rigid and lifeless.
Some fine moments of
humour help to alleviate
the irritating repetitiveness
of Mr Pringle, a laboured
character well handled by
Malcolm Frederick. Corinne
Skinner Carter as his wife,
is given far more scope and
emotional depth, and
handles her part well.
Alas, Poor Fred is at the
Battersea Arts Centre until
the 8th June, and opens for
two days at the North
Peckham Civic Centre on
the 12th.

Another somewhat
disappointing film is Paul
Matursky's Down and Out
in Beverely Hills which
starts off well as a satire on
the lives of the rich folks in
Beverely Hills but
ultimately pulls it's punches
and ends up as a
vindication of the lifestyle
the Great American Dream.
The characters are the
street person (tramp), a
wealthy coat hanger
manufacturer, his repressed
wife who hires gurus to
assist her enlightenment,
their daughter 'a blur with a
nice smell' and their son
whose inability to
communicate with his
parents result in him
leaving videos for them to
watch which provides one
of the better jokes. The
best characters are the
Mexican maid, the
marvellous Magritte the
dog and the brilliant dog
psychiatrist whose skills
enable him to diagnose
nipple ancestry in Magritte
and to suggest that he may
have come from a nine dog
litter, but his presence is al
too short lived.
The film concerns itself
with the way the tramp's
arrival into the family
affects the lives of all it's
members and how their
neuroses are cured by the
wisdom of this free man.
Unfortunately it merely
reaffirms the Great
American way which once
again seems to include the
notion that foreigners are
figures of fun. Pity, it coulc
have been very good rathe
thn just funny in parts.
'Euroshima is Laurie Booth's
poignant ballet about the
power of nations. Taking the
bombing of Hiroshima in 1945
as a reference point, Booth
and his company, The Cargo
Cult, set off to explore issues
such as communication
between countries, national
defence and the constant fear
of attack, using movement and
motifs rooted in Oriental
culture. Heavy? Not quite.
Whilst the dancers are both
expressive and versatile, their
work is punctuated with
informal and amusing gestures
and expressions in a
nonchalant attempt to talk to
the audience through speech
rather than movement. The
show is complemented by an
excellent set from John
Newton, and runs at the I.C.A.
until tomorrow.BJofm Burgess'
