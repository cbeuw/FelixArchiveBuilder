and continue it, so here
goes.
C o l l e g e band Duo seem
long overdue for a mention
in these pages. T h e y are a
four piece outfit w h o
formed in the autumn term

Richard H a n a n (Bass) a n d
Ian Morris (Keyboards and
Voacals). They're from
C h e m E n g 2 with the
exception of Ian w h o hails
from C i v E n g 1.
D u o play a d a n c e a b l e
brand of pop rock w h i c h is
difficult to characterise,
perhaps the best
impression of their s o u n d
can be gained by the fact
that they d o a creditable
cover version of 'Everybody
Wants to Rule the World'.
T h e y are keen to avoid the
college band tag and
although concentrating on
their degrees at present
they have well thought out
plans for the future. Their
most recent gig was at the
Rag Fete party in the
Holland club and this will
be their last for a while.
Over the s u m m e r they have
three days b o o k e d in a
studio to record a d e m o for
circulation to clubs a n d
other potential venues,
thereafter the lads are
playing it by ear. Hopefully
a string of gigs outside
college will lead to greater
things - one c a n only wish
them luck. Significantly
they list as one of their best
gigs so far an outside event
at Nutford H o u s e . O n this

an edge over a more
conventional d i s c o or band.

addition of "War Ain't a

version of " J o h n n y B.

vast improvement on the
previous effort although I
felt the production was a
little unbalanced at points,
especially for the backing

picking out (you must bear
in mind here that I'm
slightly deaf - too many

...AND ROLL
College administrator,
Michael Arthur looks at the
problems caused by
supermarket trolleys.
The ubiquitous
supermarket trolley is
probably the most widely
used form of transport
around the C o l l e g e
c a m p u s . Undoutedly, it is
an extremely convenient
vechile, ideally suited not
o n l y to trundling the week's
fodder h o m e from
S a i n s b u r y s but also to a
multitude of other
tasks—shifting equipment,
moving to a new room and
delivering FELIX to name
but a few.
Unfortunately, we have
rather lost sight of the fact
supermarket trolleys belong
in supermarkets.
Sainsburys don't even allow
y o u to take trolleys off their
site and Waitrose only do
s o on the understanding
that y o u are going to bring
them back. A c c o r d i n g to
Sainsbury's, around 600 of
their trolleys disappear for
ever each year from the
C r o m w e l l R o a d branch
alone. At £50 a time plus
the cost of e m p l o y i n g
s o m e o n e to scour the
streets for a b a n d o n e d
trolleys, they reckon they
have to sell over £600,000
worth of groceries before
they recover the cost of
trolley abuse. This e x p e n s e
is reflected in higher prices
at the tills.
In C o l l e g e terms, trolleys
are a nuisance. A lot of
m a n p o w e r goes into
rounding up trolleys and
getting them back to the
supermarkets. This is
particularly so in Princes
G a r d e n s and Evelyn
G a r d e n s . Incidentally, if the
residence h a n d y m e n spent
less time c h a s i n g trolleys,
they c o u l d spend more
time improving residences.
The most serious
c o n s e q u e n c e , however, is
the effect on our relations
with neighbours and
visitors. N e i g h b o u r s are
important. Living close to a
student c o m m u n i t y
requires a fair level of
tolerance at the best of
times and we w o u l d do well
not to try their patience by
cluttering up the place with
trolleys. T h e C o l l e g e has
many visitors and it does
our image no g o o d at all
when they see that the best
a renowned centre of
S c i e n c e and T e c h n o l o g y
can d o for transport is to
steal trolleys from
supermarkets.
U n d e r the C o l l e g e
Discipline c o d e m i s c o n d u c t
'likely to affect the g o o d
name and standing of the
College' is a disciplinary
offence. A l t h o u g h no one
has ever been 'done' for
stealing supermarket
trolleys, it clearly c o m e s
under this heading and it
may only be a matter of
time before the C o l l e g e
feels that it has to take
action to bring the trolley
problem under control.
FELIX Friday 6 June 11
