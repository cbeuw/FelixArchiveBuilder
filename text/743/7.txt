Whores.
'The real man wishes for two things: danger
and recreation. Hence man wants woman as
the most dangerous plaything. Man should be
brought up for the purpose of war and woman
for the relaxation of the soldier; everything
else is foolish.'
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
The complicated and
inconclusive turn of events
in Troilus and Cressida
make this one of
Shakespeare's lesser
known tragedies. This is a
pity, for a more poignant
view of sexuality such as
this would be hard to find
in early drama. Two great
nations war for the
affections of a tinselled
Queen, as wives and
daughters are bartered for
soldiers in battle. By this
token, common peasant
girls become heroines and
empresses are whores.
Howard Davies' new
production is set against
the background of the
Crimean War. A clever
touch, for Shakespeare's
study of honour-for a man,
to protect Queen and
country; for a woman, to
honour her chastity-is well
suited to the high moral
etiquette of Victorian
conduct.
It is unfortunate that
Shakespeare's conclusion
to Troilus and Cressida is
so underdeveloped. Davies
has not entirely overcome
the difficulties involved and
some of the final scenes
more closely resemble
Bedroom Farce than
Theatre of War.
The joy of this
production undoubtedly
lies in the flippant but
elegant handling of
Shakespeare's text.
Occasionally the light
hearted behaviour of the
actors threatens to mar the
more important aspects of
the play, but these
moments are rare. Clive
Merrison provides a superb
interpretation of Pandarus,
Cressida's eccentric uncle,
and his flamboyant style
appears to draw much from
Osbourne's Entertainer.
Thersites, a deformed and
scurrilous Greek, is
brilliantly transformed by
Alun Armstrong into a
disaffected Northern bigot.
His impertinent mimicry of
the bone-headed Ajax is
particularly memorable.
The high standard of
acting is complemented by
some fine production.
Ralph Koltai has designed
a.n elaborate palacial
vestibule some thirty feet
tall, which, coupled with
Jeffrey Beecroft's versatile
lighting comfortably serves
war chambers, officer's
mess, tavern and courtyard
