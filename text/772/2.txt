Letters FELIX, Friday May 22nd 1987 2
Gay one
Dear Dave,
Haying:, read the last issue of
FELIX, with its letters on the subject
of gays by Andrew Thomis and Hugh
MacKenzie, I would like to add my
own comments on this issue.
It is a great pity that Mr Thomis
was unable to read the closing
statement of Hugh MacKenzie"s letter
before he decided to base his
argument purely on the act of sex.
As Mr MacKenzie so correctly-
stated, the issue should hinge on
"What is the right relationship
between sex and love?".
I fail to see what is so "unappealing
aesthetically' about two people, of
any gender, "making love" but I do.
however, find this of two people
"having sex".
It should be realised that the most
precious gift anyone can give is that
of their love. Bodies can be bought
or sold but love can only be received
or offered, and it is this
incorruptibility which should be the
basis of our actions.
If we have, in the words of Mr
Thomis, " A desire to extend an
emotional relationship physically" we
should be able to do so without
villification no matter what the sex or
race of our partner. To go on,
however, as Mr Thomis does, to say
that the act of sex is the "desire to
demonstrate your affection" is very
wrong for love does not need
demonstrating where it exists already.
Therefore I see no need for Andrew
Bannister to say how much blood
there is about when he does it
(FELIX, March 18th) just as I have
no wish to hear about who does it with
who around College. It should be
accepted that if two people love each
other this is a beautiful thing. Still
more importantly we should see that
you can have love without sex and,
perhaps unfortunately, you can have
sex without love.
Yours sincerely,
Alistair Goodall (Geology I)
Gay two
Dear Dave,
In his letter to FELIX (Letters 15th
May) the one thing that Andrew
Thomis seems to lose sight of is that
we are talking about fellow human
beings. This includes many of my
friends and probably many of his. The
least Mr Thomis can do is to face up
to his prejudices rather than couching
them in mock, socialogical and
anthropological language.
Yours,
Chas Jackson
Gay three
Dear Dave.
Last week's FELIX published two
letters from people who had
something to say about the issue of
homosexuality, which between them
managed to raise some rather
interesting points. They were printed
under the respective headings of
'Imperial Gay not Okay' and
'Confusion and Corruption', and I
will deal with them in that order.
The first came from Andrew
Thomis. who after some background
preamble made the point that the
family unit in all great societies has
been a fact, and is a necessary cultural
norm. Sure. I agree with that, and
with Mr Thomis' assertion that such
a unit is needed for the development
of our children, although I might be
a little less rigid than he is about the
definition of a family unit.
This point, we were told, implied
that certain types of sexual behaviour
are abhorrent; namely rape,
indiscriminant sexual intercourse,
and—wait for it—homosexuality.
Well, I must agree that I find rape
horrifying and inexcusable, and if I
thought that Mr Thomis was
suggesting I wanted to make it
acceptable I would be furious.. .but he
isn't, is he?
Indiscriminate sexual intercourse,
in my view, doesn't do anyone any
good, mostly because I suspect that
it leads to emotional damage, but also
in these troubled times it can be
dangerous.
Which brings us to homosexuality.
Mr Thomis describes this as a socially
useless, even damaging activity, and
one which is aesthetically
unappealing. Well, I obviously have
to leave that last bit to personal
opinion, although I might add that if
you think about it, just about any
conceivable sexual act, heterosexual
or otherwise, if viewed in the cold
light of day is pretty bloody
unappealing anyway. But socially
useless and damaging? I can't agree.
Any act of physical l o v e -
emphasising the iove'—should be a
fulfilling and heart-warming
experience, which apart from
bringing the two people involved
closer together, will also help them
to relate better to those around them:
Anyone who is glowing happily this
morning will know what I mean. As
a cynical addition, I might say that
homosexual acts create no battered or
abandoned babies, and do not add to
the world population problem.
As a final rejoinder to Mr Thomis,
I suggest that before he makes
remarks about pointless hedonism and
a desire to be penetrated yourself, he
should make sure he knows what he
is talking about! I don't go round
making ignorant remarks about the
hedonism of man penetrating woman,
so give me the same consideration.
And now. taking a deep breath, I turn
to the second letter, written by Hugh
McKenzie. who asks what is the right
relationship between sex and love? If
you ask that sort of question in a
lecture, the prof coughs and says:
"I'm glad you asked me that..."
In other words. I'm not sure. I
don't think there can be just one right
relationship, but I believe that love is
the most important aspect, without
which sex in itself is more or less
worthless, a mere scratching of a
physical itch. If sex is part of a loving
relationship, it can help to bring a
couple closer together in a very
wonderful way. I reckon that's about
all I'm qualified to say on that subject.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Bannister, Gay and
Lesbian Welfare Officer
Gay four
Dear Dave,
Unfortunately I feel obliged to add
a section of comment to the debate
about the Gay and Lesbian Welfare
Officer. Since my election, I have
been informed by many people that
they expect me to fold the Gay Society
and remove the G/L Welfare Officer
from Council.
I am sorry if my saying that I have
absolutely no intention of doing any
such thing disappoints those people
and friends who elected me, but
unfortunately they disappoint me with
their short sighted and narrow minded
attitude; it was this kind of attitude
that necessitated the establishment of
these institutions to protect gay
people's rights.
More concerning is the fact that
some people have confided in me the
information that others threaten
physical violence towards the high
profile members of this society.
Although I stand by the ideals of
majority rule I will not stand for
victimisation, violence or oppression.
In general people who demonstrate
hatred or violence are merely showing
the symptoms of fear or paranoia.
There is no reason to fear gay people;
they are extremely unlikely to want
to harm or harrass anyone. In fact all
those I have met are exceedingly
friendly and reasonable. At the same
time I can assure the reader that they
are far more worried about AIDS than
you ever will be.
It is all very well everyone
discussing the rights and wrongs of
the matter of homosexuality through
the FELIX letters page. But how
many of these wise and wonderful
people have ever sat down face to face
with a gay person and discussed it
with him or her?
Anyone ignorant enough to go out
'queer bashing' obviously does not
realise that they are not at all likely
to change the sexuality of a gay
person by the means of fear. For if
this was true, AIDS would have
achieved this ages ago. All it would
do, would be to push them into
oppression and hiding and then no one
would know where they stood. There
would be far more success to be
gained by beating me up, as it might
scare me enough to stop me
supporting the rights of these
intimidated individuals. Then again it
might make me all the more
determined!
This whole issue does not just relate
to gay people, but to all of the world's
minorities who live in fear. As a note
for anyone who judges anyone on
religious grounds I would just like to
say, "who are you to judge someone
else's servant? To his own master he
stands or falls" (Romans 14:4).
Finally I must point out that it has
come to my attention that certain
persons have been calling me a
heterosexist. I have been trying to
attain a clear definition of what this
term means and have found it to be
impossible. If as it appears, it means
that I prefer relationships with
women, then too damned right I do!
Yours,
Ian Howgate
Managers in
clover
Dear Sir,
Should student managers be paid
£100 per hour? (per week, I think—
Ed). This is currently the case in some
Imperial College
accommodation...and the student
residents foot the bill.
In one particular head tenancy, the
manager and his wife enjoy a flat
which would cost students over £70
per week (over £3,600 pa) and have
this and their electricity and gas paid
by the other residents. An apparent
abuse of this latter privilege has meant
that the student manager's latest
electricity bill at approximately £270
for 15 weeks exceeded the sum of
costs attributable to all other 22
residents. In return the manager's
duties occupy about 3—4 hours a
month.
I do not criticise this particular
manager, or others, for taking
advantage of the free accommodation
offered—who would not do so in their
place?—and indeed in this case the
manager fulfils those duties expected
of him adequately. It does, however,
appear very irresponsible that the
current arrangements concerning
managers' residence fees should stand
as they are, especially when their
income is 3 or 4 times that of the
students paying! As for students
paying the manager's electricity, etc,
doubling their bills in some of the
above cases, clearly this would be
hard to justify. The fact that students
