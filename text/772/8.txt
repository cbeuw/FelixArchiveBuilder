Texas
Lone Star
Take a walk down Gloucester Road
and you can't help but notice a giant
fibre glass Indian, slightly the worse
for wear, guarding the entrance to the
Texas Lone Star. This ail-American
restaurant has been one of the more
popular student haunts in recent
years, due largely to its enormous
portions and value-for-money prices.
Its proximity to both Evelyn Gardens
and the College central make it an
excellent venue for group meals.
It does have its disadvantages,
however. If you choose to visit
between 7.30pm and 10.30pm there
is invariably a queue for tables, and
at peak times this can mean a wait of
up to % hour—some students make
valuable use of this time at the bar,
where you can eat as many crisps with
spicy dips as you like. The best time
to go is about 7.00pm when you can
be instantly seated, stuffed full and
out before the crowds arrive.
Drinks tend towards the expensive
but the food works out at about £5 a
head. The best value is undoubtedly
the 'Slab of Ribs' at £4.95 which
includes a side salad, potatoes
(chipped, au gratin or baked) along
with a foot long slab of barbequed
ribs. Other items on the menu include
Chicken Enchilada, Mexican Chilis,
enormous salads, steaks and tacos.
Should you still have room left for
afters, then there's blueberry ice
cream, cheesecake, or even chocolate
fudge cake served hot with cream.
The service is quick and friendly
with the working policy of get 'em in,
fill 'em up and then get rid of 'em
pronto. They also do take-aways if
you don't fancy waiting at peak times.
Throroughly recommended.

RESTAURANTS
When IC students eat out, it almost
invariably seems to be a question of
"going for a curry". The Dehli
Brasserie, 134 Cromwell Road (just
past Sainsbury's), is in a class of its
own if you are looking for Indian
cuisine in the local area. The
restaurant has only been open for just
over a year, but in that time it has
built up quite a considerable clientele
of Imperial College students. Though
the range of dishes is a little more
limited than at some other restaurants
in the area, I have not found any of
the food it serves prepared as well
anywhere else. You will not find any
spectacular variations from 'normal'
Tandoori cooking on the menu, but
Dehli Brasserie
you will almost certainly find that
they do the more familiar dishes as
well as any other restaurant you can
name.
The service is just about the
friendliest you are likely to come
across, which makes the Dehli
Brasserie an excellent choice for more
intimate eating out. The waiters
always present all the ladies with a
carnation when you leave the
restaurant.
Though it is fractionally more
pricey than better known local Indian
restaurants, such as the Kwality, the
Dehli is still excellent value and I
thoroughly recommend it for any
occasion.
RESTAURANTS
Kowloon
The laid-back cafe atmosphere of the
Kowloon makes it an ideal place to
pick up something to eat before hitting
the clubs and cinemas in and around
Leicester Square. The last order is at
12 midnight so you can even crawl
there when they chuck you out of the
pub. The best idea, I find, is to skip
the set-meals and head for the soup's
page. Feeling hungry? Go for a
noodle soup—there's a selection of
about 8 but I would definitely
recommend the Won Ton Noodle
Soup (the restaurant's speciality) at
£1.80. If you're still feeling
hungry—just the soup can be
sufficient if you're eating very late—
turn back a page in the menu and
you'll find the noodle and rice dishes.
These range from about £2.80 to
£3.60, ask for an extra bowl as one
rice or noodle dish will feed 2 people,
I would recommend the Chicken and
Chinese Mushroom Rice/Noodle or
the Braised Brisket Rice (this can be
a bit heavy-going).
If you find youself wandering
around this area of London during the
day pop into the Kowloon for tea and
cakes. The tea is obviously Chinese
tea and the cakes are made downstairs
in the bakery and are very unusual,
I would recommend the Lotus Paste,
Melon Paste or the funny little
Coconut Ball (thingys) at about 40p
each, they're great fun and you can
spend as long as you like taking in the
atmosphere of Soho on a Sunday (or
any) afternoon.

MUSIC
Tesla/Little Angels
With all the hype, Telsa were
guaranteed a good turn out. Neil
Murray, Atomik Tommy, M Buttz
and Spike, even Barry Norman was
spotted outside by yours truly.
To be sure of getting in I had to
arrive early enough to get wet in the
queue and to catch the support band,
The Little Angels. However, they
were to spoil the whole show; nothing
could follow them. They completely
blew Tesla off stage!
They are a Scarborough five piece
with a mean line in catchy riffs that
don't just make your feet tap, they
come straight out and shake your
whole damn leg.
Their sound is somewhere between
Van Halen and Bon Jovi, but their
true strength comes in the way Jim
and Bruce Dickson (no relation)
integrate keyboards and guitar like I
though only Deep Purple could.
With songs that are clean, guttzie
and presented by the most
instantaneous and (dare I say it)
perfect bands I've ever seen, there is
only one direction for this band!
After all that, Tesla were a let
down. Although their songs are
strong and presented in a manner that
would make The Scorpions very
flattered, it lacked the spark that
makes a gig something special.
Despite having an uneasy vocalist
and a P A W on guitar, the
musicianship was faultless and at
times inspiring, the best moments
coming where they cranked it down
for tracks such as We're no good
together and Modern Day Cowboy.
On the whole, Tesla were a band
whose music grows on you and
perhaps given, a few listens, I might
have enjoyed the show as much as the
rest of the crowd.
