F E L I X FELIX, Friday May 22nd 1987
Deep in the dungeon of Beit castle,
Ian Whygate and Alan Ego were
practising their handshakes. In a few
weeks' time they would be taking
over as head citizens of Cheapskate,
and since all the powerful people in
the Surefield fortress were members
of the Band of Bricklayers, Whygate
and Ego had decided that they should
become members too. Everyone in
Surefield was a bricklayer, except for
Arthur Michael, whose wrist was
never stiff enough for him to be able
to shake hands properly. Whygate and
Ego had spent most of the morning
congratulating each other on being
elected to head citizen and deputy
head citizen. Whygate thought he had
been very clever again. He had spent
a whole year talking as loud as
possible, for as long as possible, on
as many committees as possible; in
the end all the citizens had promised
to vote for him on condition that he
kept quiet from now on. Ego thought
that Whygate had been very clever,
too, but he had fixed his election in
a much more subtle way. Ego had
stood very close to the list of
candidates for deputy head citizen,
and whenever another citizen tried to
write their name up he had trodden
on their toes. Funnily enough, he had
been the only candidate applying for
the job when Gutters had come to
collect all the names.
When he had finished practising
handshakes, Ego finished his twelfth
pint and hurried across Cheapskate to
the rent collector's office. As well as
wanting to be a bricklayer, Ego was
already a member of the 'Minions',
a secret society founded by
Cheapskate rent collector Lesley
Grievous Bodily Harm, who had
recently changed her name to L
Capone in order to save ink. The
other Minions, Kettle, Custard and
Hamster were already there, and were
taking it in turns to fill L Capone's
glass for her. As usual, L Capone was
talking about Arthur Michael and
Hardlyworthit, the Cheapskate house
builder. "Something has got to be
done, boys", she was saying. " A l l
the ceilings in Hardlyworthit's houses
keep falling on the citizens' heads,
and every time it happens
Hardlyworthit and Arthur Michael
just sit back and giggle. I think I may
have another job for you, boys".

looked at each other and groaned...
Unaware of what devious plans
were being hatched in the rent
collector's office, Arthur Michael was
sitting in his room in the Surefield
fortress and concentrating very hard
on stirring his cup of coffee. Arthur
Michael was feeling very pleased with
himself. While Ms Plague and
Mummylonglegs, the citizens'
leaders, were not looking he had gone
out to buy a new rubber dinghy for
his favourite group of citizens, the
paddlers. The paddlers had wanted
the citizens' treasury committee to
buy them a new rubber dinghy, but
had asked for so much money that
they had been told that they had to
wait for a year. The paddlers, who
were very keen to have a new dinghy,
had asked Arthur Michael to buy one
for them without telling the rest of the
citizens. Arthur Michael had bought
a new dinghy very cheaply, and now
he was trying to persuade Ms Plague
and Mummylonglegs to give him the
money back. He couldn't understand
why they weren't pleased that he had
saved them so much money.
Suddenly, Arthur Michael's phone
rang. He was horrified to hear John
Secretary asking him to come up to
his office; Arthur Michael had been
terrified of John Secretary ever since
the Cheapskate Board of Gnomes had
decided to throw 100 people out of
Cheapskate. He was afraid that John
Secretary was going to take the
opportunity to sack him at last. In
fact, when Arthur Michael got to his
office, John Secretary was deep in
conversation with Derek Dash. Derek
and John Secretary were planning a
devious scheme to make all the
citizens get up earlier; Derek wanted
classes at Cheapskate school to start
at 8.30 instead of 9.30. Suddenly
there was a shout in the corridor
outside. Derek looked outside to see
his wife, Mad Dash, running past the
office, waving her citizen's "awfully
nice person" tie about her head.
"Quick", shouted Derek to Arthur
Michael, "go and ring Ms Plague.
She'll keep her quiet for a few
hours"...
Will Arthur Michael lose his job?
Will anyone notice?
Will Whygatejoin the bricklayers ?
Where will L Capone strike next?
Find out (perhaps) in another
installment of the "Baron of
Cheapskate".
