pay the bill, when this is not written
into their contracts, apart from being
unreasonable on moral grounds,
appears to contravene the Housing
Act and is currently being disputed by
some residents.
I am sure that many in College
would welcome confirmation that the
rumoured review of the managers'
rent is in fact taking place.

Building in
Beit
Dear Mr Smith,
Re: Building works in the Old
Hostel, Beit Hall
We have been informed by Dr
Finlay, the Warden of Beit Hall, that
demolition and building work on the
ground floor of the Old Hostel will
begin on May 26th.
We find this totally unacceptable.
We are not willing to suffer during
our exams or in the period before
them, the noise and inconvenience
that this work will entail. There are
a number of finalists next to the
building area and they, in particular,
cannot afford, this disturbance.
We would therefore request that the
start of the work be postponed until
after the end of term.
Yours sincerely,
A group from the Basement,
Ground and First Floors, Old
Hostel, Beit Hall.

Larry's
Larceny
Dear Dave,
We are writing because we would
like to warn other IC students about
the experiences we had last Friday at
Crazy Larry's (on the corner of
King's Road and Lots Road), and we
thought that FELIX was the best way
to do this.
We had planned to go to Crazy
Larry's for the annual dinner of IC
Underwater Club. When we rang to
enquire about the price, we were told
it would cost £15 for a 3-course meal
and as much wine/lager as we wanted
until 12 midnight. When we rang
again to book, this price was
confirmed.
When we arrived, we found that the
price had gone up! They wanted us
to pay £20.00 per head, or £12.00 per
head for the meal only with no alcohol
included. Also, the most expensive
combination of starter, main course
and sweet came to only £11 and they
wanted full payment in advance. We
decided that since it would be quite
hard to drink £9 worth of alcohol each
(assuming that lager was sold at
'normal' prices rather than £2 per
pint!), we should leave. Clearly, we
had been deceived about the price just
to get us there. The whole thing spoilt
the major social event of the Club and
upset a lot of people.
We would like to suggest to other
IC students that they avoid Crazy
Larry's unless they are prepared to
part with a small fortune.
Yours sincerely,

Dave the meat
Dear Sir,
At the hustings UGM (7th May),
the Deputy President's report stated
that Norman's might start selling halal
meat.
It seems to me that the Union is
forgetting to cater for the majority;
we are not all Muslims or vegetarians!
To the best of my knowledge the
majority of students at College are
normal omnivores.
Since March there have been no
normal meat meals available at
Norman's during lunchtime. When
are we going to see a change? I look
forward to hearing a reply from
Norman, since it appears the Snack
Bar takes little notice of the students
verbal comments during the
lunchtimes and evenings.
Yours omnivorously,
DP Tyler

Dear Dave,
I am writing to complain about the
completely lackadaisical way in which
Social Colours have been handled this
year. I am involved in two Major
Subcommittees, and in both there has
been an element of farce surrounding
them.
Firstly, on Publications Board the
thirteen, read it, thirteen colours
awarded by FELIX are a joke. If you
have thirteen outstanding and
unbelieveably worthwhile
contributors, and the regular staff too,
why hasn't FELIX been absolutely
brilliant every week? Not to say that
any one of those awarded did not
deserve colours—one cannot know—
but those who would know and have
a fair chance to debate them were this
year denied this opportunity. The Pub
Board Chairman, Chris Martin,
decided to break with the usual
tradition of a meeting between
himself, the FELIX Editor, the
STOIC Chairman and the IC Radio
Station Manager, and instead merely
asked for 'objections' which would
have been difficult to justify unless
each individual case was discussed
which, as I have said, was not. The
colours Committee, who awarded the
colours, naturally knew nothing about
individual contributions to clubs, and
therefore could do little but accept
them all.
Secondly, the Social and Cultural
Clubs Committees (No, Dave, the
Social Clubs Committee—Ed) . With
amazing incompetence the SCC
Chairman, Richard Eccleston, for the
second year running, managed to
completely mess up the awards for all
the clubs involved. Last year, the
invitations for nominations were sent
out the day before they were due in,
with the result that many clubs missed
out. This year, not even one day was
given—no notification whatsoever
was given to any clubs on SCC. Then
how did the actual colours awarded
get decided? At one point it was
thought that the 'nominations' were
one per club, but the apparent truth
is that names from the attendance of
SCC meetings were used! I need not
comment further on how plain silly
this is.
With the present arrangement of
colours awards, it is time that those
club committee chairmen who have
messed up (and I only have
experience of these two—there may
be more!) took their responsibilities
seriously. There are many people
within Pub Board who now feel their

colours devalued, and many more on
SCC who, on receipt of last week's
FELIX felt shocked and surprised to
find their names missing, or in print

It would be nice if everything ran
smoothly, wouldn't it?

Accommodation
Barring any major hiccups at the very
last minute, the College appears to
have 200 more places in residence in
their grasp at last. This is probably
the most significant thing that College
has done so far this year, at least as
far as students are concerned. If only
a portion of the 200 places are
available for allocation at the start of
next session it should help to avoid
the now familiar chaos in the Student
Accommodation Office, when too
many incoming students are squeezed
into too few rooms. In the light of the
College recruitment drive aimed at
overseas students it is difficult to be
enthusiastic in the long term, though.
When more fee-paying students are
attracted to bring in more money,
more needs to be spent on
accommodation. There remains a
serious lack of College-maintained
residences at Imperial, and though the
new premises in Evelyn Gardens are
a great step forward the search for
new accommodation must still be
number one priority.
Yet more on Gay news
As expected, we have a page of letters
devoted to the gay/lesbian issue this
week. I was quite amazed to read in
Ian's letter tha he has been
approached by students who fully
expect him to try and close down an
IC Gay Society and dispense with any
representation for the gay/lesbian
community. Though several readers
may be getting bored with the
continued priority I am giving to this
issue, I would suggest to anyone who
wishes to see the support for gays and
lesbians come to an end that they
write in and express an opinion as
quickly as possible; this issue is here
to stay, and there are enough people
who think as I do to prevent it being
ignored.
