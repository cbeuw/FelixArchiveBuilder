Platform for all
Freedom of speech is guaranteed to
any guest speakers of Imperial
College L'nion societies as from next
year. Section 43 of the Education
(No. 2) Act. entitled "Freedom of
speech in universities, polytechnics
and Colleges", comes into effect on
September 1st 1987. Under this Act.
any person or group of people
involved in governing such an
institution has the duty to ensure, as
far as "reasonably possible", that no-
one is denied the use of any premises
of the establishment on grounds
connected with their beliefs or views.
The University may still act on advice
from the police that the holding of a
meeting is likely to lead to a breach
of the peace, and speaches inciting
violence or racial hatred are still
unlawful.
All institutions of higher education
have to draw up orders of practice to
help them prevent a disruption of
controversial meetings.
IC's draft version names the
College Secretary, John Smith, as the
man in in charge of arrangements for
any such meeting.
Sour grapes
The proposed merger with St Mary's
Hospital Medical School was
supported by a large majority at a
meeting of the Board of Studies on
May 6th. However,, opposition to the
merger was expressed by Professor
Savers. Head of the Department of
Computing and Dean of City &
Guilds College. He said that the
merger would make Imperial a more
average institution, jeopardise its
existing links with the medical world
and could lead to financial
embarrassment for the College.
Professor Sayers added that he would
prefer a form of association rather
than a merger with SMHMS, in such
a way that academic benefits could be
gained without taking the risks
inherent in amalgamation.
Rise and shine
Students in some departments may be
faced with lectures at 8.30am next
October. The College's Development
Planning Group are looking into the
"regionalistation of use of lecture
theatres". As from October,
departments will be trying to
timetable most lectures for one
undergraduate year in the afternoons,
and, in general, use of lecture theatres
and rooms will be timetabled on a
regional basis. It is envisaged that
8.30am to 9.30am lectures may be
required to provide additional
flexibility. These measures are being
considered as a revision of a College
Plan which was approved in 1985 for
a three year period.
Gross diplomacy; a letter from the President
Re: Annual Report—Iranian Students
Dear Dave,
I have been approached by an
Iranian student who complained
about the comment in my annual
report regarding Iranian students
facing ' 'similar pressures'' to those
experienced by some Iraqi students at
the College. In retrospect I realise
that this may have been seen as an
unfair generalisation and I am sorry
if I have caused any offence to those
concerned. I shall attempt to explain
some of the background to my
comment.
Throughout the year I have tried to
support those Iraqi students at
College who have been subject to any
kind of interference from their
Government with their activity and
study in this country. My involvement
was in line with current IC Union
policy and at the request of a number
of the students concerned. As I know
little about the issues or organisations
involved at the start of the year I
checked through national media,
Amnesty International, NUS and
other student union documentation on
the subject, being aware of the fact
that the political issues at stake could
be extremely complex. During the
course of my investigations I came
across much documentation and
evidence relating to problems faced
by some Iranian students. These may
have been based on a different
national situation but appeared to
follow a similar pattern. It therefore
came as no surprise to me to be
approached by some Iranian students
who, having heard of my involvement
with Iraqi student issues, informed me
that they, too, had experienced
problems. My remarks in the annual
report were intended to acknowledge
this rather than singling out one
group and ignoring others. This may
have been naive and misleading of
me, in which case again I apologise.
However I am unwilling to believe
that I was misled by the Iranian
students who spoke to me; and as long
as any students of this Union have a
genuine problem I will continue to
support them.
I hope this sheds some light on the
matter which,I appreciate, is a
delicate one. Incidentally I was happy
to think that somebody actually got as
far as page 4 of my Annual Report in
the first place!
Yours,
Christine Taig
