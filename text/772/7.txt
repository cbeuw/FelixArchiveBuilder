Remarkable story
In the state of Virginia, if you are
accused of capital offence then you
won't get justice unless you can afford
it. If you want to appeal against a
death sentence then you'll have to
pay; and pay well because the average
legal fee is around $10,000. The state
will not help you: it may have forked
out a colossal $687 to pay a lawyer
at your trial but clearly it doesn't see
any value in the appeal process.
Clearly Virginia State is not interested
in proper justice.
One woman struggles against this
injustice. One woman takes it upon
herself to persuade lawyers to
represent poor prisoners on death
row. One woman believes injustice.
Imperial College Amnesty
International Groiip will show a video
portraying the struggle of this one
woman: Marie Deanz. (Tues 26th
May at 1.00pm in the Senior
Common Room, Union Building).
Please come and see the remarkable
story of this woman.

Spanner in the works
To the clubs, departmental societies,
and departmental reps in City and
Guilds Union.
Work on Spanner, the annual guide
to City and Guilds College is due to
begin shortly. Traditionally, Spanner
contains articles submitted by Guilds
clubs and societies, explaining the
activities in which they are involved,
and the events they have organised.
As Spanner will provide Freshers
with their only introduction to your
club or society it is important not to
miss this opportunity. Clubs should
have already received a letter
requesting submissions for inclusion
in Spanner.
The deadline for clubs articles is
June 1st. As a guide, 200 words is an
acceptable minimum although most
clubs submit articles substantially
longer. Particularly welcome are any
photographs of clubs in action, Guilds
events, or embarrassing pictures of
the Exec. A l l photographs will be
treated with care and respect and will
be returned when finished with.
Photographs are welcome anytime
before the end of term.
We are also looking for general i
interest articles on any subject.
Suggestions include alternative pub
guides, a guide to College refectories,
mascotry, cartoons, amusing verse,
etc. If you have any ideas please
contact the Editor, Bill Goodwin, via
the Mech Eng Undergraduate pigeon
holes.
Contributions should be sent to;

More success for Fours
Last weekend saw more success for
the boat club; on our home water at
Putney Town Regatta and at Holme
Pierrepoint at Nottingham City
Regatta.
At Putney, the coxless four rowed
well, despite only having trained
together as a crew for about a week,
and shrugged off all signs of illness
to win the senior A fours event.
At Nottingham, on Saturday, the
two IC fours raced; one in a coxed
boat and the other coxless. Having
borrowed a boat which was too small
for the crew in the coxed event, they
rowed well to finish only l
A a lenth
behind the Leander crew, these two
being well in front of the rest of the
Elite fours. In the Elite coxless fours,
IC was confronted by a high class
field of club and university crews and
by the Notts County Rowing
Association four, who were silver
medalists in last year's world
championships.
In a close fought race, the IC crew
came from well down in the last 500
metres to finish second to the Notts
County crew. The only win at
Nottingham on Saturday came in the
Elite Double sculls where the IC crew
surprised themselves and their coach,
winning by some two lengths from
Leander Club.
On Sunday both IC fours raced in
the Elite coxless event and both made
the final. Here, the 'heavyweight'
four had a very close race with Notts
County, which they were unlucky to
lose to by only l
A a length. The
'lightweight' four finished in third
place, also beating all the university
and club crews. In the single sculls,
both Tony Reynolds and Vince Roper
shrugged off their problems' of the day
before and won senior C and senior
B sculls respectively. The IC double
scull, racing 'lightweight' on Sunday,
had a few problems at the start with
a computer which said they didn't
exist despite their presence in the
programme. They did, however, go
on to win their second event of the
weekend convincingly. Another
member of Imperial College Boat
Club, Nick Burfitt raced with the GB
national squad at Mannheim Regatta
on both Saturday and Sunday. His
crew finished third on both days, in
coxless fours, only some 2 seconds
behind the West German world
champions from 1985.

Boring Frenchies visit
Early last term 26 students from IC
were entertained by students of the
Ecole Superieur de Physique et
Chemie in Paris. At the end of term
31 French students sont arrives at IC.
In Paris we were received at the
British Council. Drink, and
conversation in English, French and
Franglais abounded. The first two
raisons d'etre for the visit had been
fulfilled. The following day we saw
the ESPCI, listened to industrial talks
and then were bustled into cars for an
exhibition of student driving a la
mode francais. We were driven to
three French companies (Air Liquide,
Procter and Gamble (France) and
Roussel (UCLAF). I visited Air
Liquide. The technology was
impressive, as was the champagne
and caviar at the reception afterwards.
This reception proved to be the start
of the blur between education and the
socialising which followed.
Lessons in dancing and
hairdressing at the Folie Bergere was
next, then the old boys reception, then
the Magnetic Terrace Jazz club and
finally a game of 'hunt the hangover'
in the clouds around the Eiffel Tower.
A reception at the Institut Francais,
followed by a jazz party in the union
opened our response. The next day,
visits to the Chemical and Electrical
Engineering departments, a talk by
Dow Chemicals and visits to Air
Products and British Gas showed the
French students that Britain does still
have some vigour and high tech. That
evening the socialising began again.
A carvery meal at the Strand Palace
Hotel. A bloat rather than a slurr. The
next day the French students were
sent off on a prize quiz of London's
landmarks. This allowed me to make
a quick trip to Sainsbury's to stock-
up for the inevitable party. Professor
Ash provided an excellent informal
reception at his house which we
followed with trips to Les Miserables
or Breaking the Code. Fortunately,
the theatrical themes were not
recreated at The Inevitable Party,
much.
Now the crucial point. All this was
achieved at a cost of £36 per ticket
to France, thanks to generous support
of industry for this educational and
social exchange of ideas. We are
particularly grateful to ICI, IBM,
Procter and Gamble (France),
International Point, Dow Chemicals,
Kodak, The Old Centralians, The
Anciens eleves of the ESPCI, and the
ESPCI for financial support totalling
more than £4500, and the Rector and
the Chemical and Electrical
Engineering departments for material
support.
Anyone interested ' in helping
organise the same thing next year
should contact R J Murray through
the Chemical Engineering letter
racks.
