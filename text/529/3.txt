ENTS Films In Muddle
Imperial College ENTS have had
to rearrange most of their films for
this term. Ther films are usually
shown in the main lecture theatre
of the Mech Eng Building, room
220, but the extensive programme
has had to be changed, from that
originally shown in the freshers'
edition of FELIX.
Next Thursday's film will be the
'French Connection' replacing
'Carrie', which will be shown at a
later date. 'Rollerball', originally
due to be shown at the Rag film
night, will not be shown at all, and
the 'Kentucky Fried Movie' due to
be shown in November is in some
doubt.
The reason for all these changes
has been due to the lateness in
booking by ENTS. Films are
usually booked towards the end of
the summer term, for the
following session, but this was not
done until half way through the
summer vacation, this year. The
result was that many of the films
were no longer available on the
nights E N T S wanted them.
However, when the situation is
sorted out another list will be
presented in FELIX. ICRN
Window Collides with Southside
Resident
O n T u e s d a y e v e n i n g , a
Southside resident ran through a
window. Nick Melling, a first year
civil engineer, was heading for his
room via the main entrance to
Southside, and mistookoneofthe
windows at the side of the doors
for an open door. He appeared to
be suffering only from minor cuts
and contusions, but was taken to
the casualty department of St
Steven's for treatment, just in
case. ICRN
Short Life Property Group
The short life property group,
started towards the end of last
term and will be continuing its
work this term. The aims of the
group are to find, renovate,
decorate and live in unused
housing around London. Rents
are as low as two or three pounds
on these properties, but they are
usually very difficult to find. Last
year two members of the group
joined a scheme in Hackney, and
they are now living there with a
very low rent. Anyone interested
in joining the group should see
Michael Arthur in the welfare
office. ICRN
Hardship Fund Abused
The College Hardship Fund has
been abused by two students who
were able to support themselves.
One of the students, a Persian
whose name has been withheld,
applied to the hardship fund for
three years, during his first
degree, but was caught when he
returned for his PhD. The student
has since repaid all the money he
o b t a i n e d f r o m the f u n d .
CINA
Refectory Suggestion Boxes
Suggestion boxes will replace
the complaints and suggestions
books in the refectories next
week. The idea of the boxes is for
students to put their suggestions
in them instead of the current
books. College decided on the
boxes instead of the books
because they felt the complaints
might be of a more constructive
nature, if they were to be read only
by student representatives. It will
then be up to these represent-
atives to complaifi to the staff
i n v o l v e d , in t h e k i t c h e n

4 t h O C T O B E R U G M R E P O R T
by our Internal Allairs Correspondent
"Were they asleep or merely dozing?" was
the question on the tip of most observers'
tongues at last Thursday's big event - the first
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n m e e t i n g .
A meeting with just about the required
quorum of thj/ee hundred managed to wade
its way through reports, motions and bye-law
changes, covering such diverse and
controversial topics, as the executive sacking
the sabbatical FELIX Editor, some members
of the Royal School of Mines playing an
invitation rugby match with a South African
team, the need to mobilize the student
movement to fight education cuts, etc. etc., in
little over thrity minutes.
A description of the effect of a bar night on
Sean O'Boyle's (RCSU president) vocal
chords raised the most response from the
meeting, with almost a ripple of appreciative
laughter.
Just after this slight stirring, the Mines
Union report was interrupted by a young lady
(whose name I did not catch) questioning the
right to report an event to a meeting in
contravention of union policy. This said event
being the proposed rugby match with a South
African team. I think it was only reasonable
that we could have expected a few good
stirring speeches attacking the flagrant
reactionary racists in Minesorcommending
their protection of the right to freedom of
choice in sport. We were, needless to say,
disappointed.
At last the meeting reached the main item
on the agenda - a motion on education cuts
proposed by the ICU President (whose vocal
chords were holding up quite well). Not an
inspired speech - but at least an attempt. On
being told, however, of the imperative for the
student movement to get off its arse, our
union members were seen to merely slump
further in their seats.
The chair throughout the meeting was
conducted efficiently by the new chairman,
Mick Berry, but then he did have little to
contend with.
The lack of inspired controversy at this
meeting could perhaps be blamed on this guy
Judice (who is he anyway?).
Political Prisoner Released
T h e I C A m n e s t y International G r o u p has heard
recently that one of their adopted prisoners of
conscience has been released. H e is M r B e n
M p a b a n g a N y a t h i from Z i m b a b w e - R h o d e s i a . H e
was arrested i n 1973 under the emergency powers
regulations, o n c o m p l e t i n g a seven-year sentence
for a political offence. H e was never tried o r even
charged after his arrest, and this is w h y Amnesty
took u p his case. A t no time was the prisoner
i n v o l v e d i n v i o l e n t p o l i t i c a l a c t i o n .
O v e r 150 political detainees were released in
Z i m b a b w e i n J u l y a n d August, in what seems to
have been a n attempt to increase support for, and
credibility of, Bishop M u z o r e w a ' s administration.
M r N y a t h i w a s a m o n g s t these p e o p l e .
A n y o n e who w o u l d like to help in the work done
by A m n e s t y International is welcome to come to

MOLE DIGS REVOLUTION
"Well," said Kevin, looking at his watch, "how
long will it take to get Socialism?"
Mole looked aghast. "You'll have to wait for
the correct revolutionary conditions," he
eventually murmured.
"Will it be very bloody?" asked John.
"I certainly hope not - don't you?" replied
mole. "I think maybe we ought to have a
discussion at one of our Monday evening
meetings in order to sort out some of these
questions."
"What a good ideal" exclaimed Barrie. "Of
course, the important thing to remember is
that changes in society can only be brought
about through mass participation and
struggle of ordinary people- beware of liberal
porcupines and tory badgers, who would
have you believe that socialists are anti-
democratic - socialism can only exist in
Britain if it is the expression of thedemocratic
will of the people" mole said' sagely.
Paul at that point stirred and suggested that
they discuss all this next week. The others
would have agreed but they were already in
the bar.
