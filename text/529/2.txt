Sirs,
As Frank James deems it fit to
name IC Rugby as one of the
"most notable offenders" in his
attack against "anti-intellectu-
alism", I feel the record must be
put straight.
Although I find his expressed
views on the CCUs debatable (to
put it mildly) I will only concern
myself with the Rugby Club.
IC Rugby Club have never held
initiation ceremonies of any form
for its members and never will do.
This Mr. James is FACT - perhaps
you should check up?
We are a sporting club and as
such exist solely to play rugby. We
have no desire to "degrade"
people or be a "creeping disease"
throughout the CCUs. Our club is
part of IC Union, not the CCUs by
the way.
The members of IC Rugby play
twice each week and train twice
each week - all because they
WANT to play rugby for IC - not
because they wish to become a
"beer-swilling lout" or a "latent
homosexual".
Heaven knows why our club
should be labelled as "detrimental
to the life of individual students
within the college".
You will notice that I have
included several quotes from Mr.
James' letter: reading them will
make you realize just how
ridiculous his comments were.
Steve Townsend
Captain IC Rugby Club
PS - I won't be sending the boys
round to "clone" you into our
way of thinking Mr. James. (Anti-
intellectualism?)
Dear Sir,
The Freshers have now been at
College for about a fortnight and
have probably formed their own
opinions about the College, the
Union and specifically the CCUs.
M a n y events have been
organized in the first week, almost
all of them by the CCUs (and the
Rugby Club). These events have
been well attended and generally
well liked.
The Constituent College Unions
are democratic organizations,
anyone can propose motions
and/or put foreward new ideas at
their meetings, most of which are
open to all students. This seems to
us to indicate a willingness to help
and be helped and to participate
with the freshers and everyone
else; it does not seem, to us at
least, that we are trying to cast
impressionable young people in a
'wicked mould.'.
'Once in a C C U all chance of
d o i n g s o m e t h i n g else is
immediately d e n i e d . ' What
rubbish! You are free to come and
go, as and when yo like. The way
FJ goes on, one would think that
we strapped freshers down in the
C C U Offices, gave them a quick
frontal Ipbotomy and force fed
them beer! On the contrary,
elected in fair and free elections,
we as Presidents take it upon
ourselves to involve people in
College life and if the CCUs can't
cater tor a particular interest, we
are the first to suggest who can.
Frank James states that anyone
taking an interest in academic
work is shunned by the CCUs.
Why then do RCSU, C&GU and
R S M U organize their own
Academic Affairs Committees,
and elect Academic Reps and
Officers who discuss problems
with the staff and other students?
Are we to assume that Prof.
Laithwaite etc are beer-swilling
louts with latent homosexual
tendencies, just because they
take part in the academic clubs
which are part of a CCU?
Another important part of a CCU,
is Rag, which undoubtedly
encourages individuality because
of the constant need for new ideas
necessary to maintain a year long
effort which collects thousands of
pounds for charity.
Frank James seems to have no
compunction about slamming the
CCUs, which get out there and
raise money for worthwhile
causes, perhaps he thinks it more
worthwhile to sit around
composing misleading letters.
Here we are speaking for the
feeling in our colleges and sign off
accordingly, does Frank James'
letter present the views of the
S o c i a l C l u b s C o m m i t t e e ?
Come on Frank, you've missed
the point, you rabbit on about
distraction from observance of
sections of the Union and then
pick on one facet of the CCUs,
completely ignoring the valuable
work done by them in all other
spheres.
Yours concernedly,
Sean O'Boyle (President RCSU)
Jo Armitage (President C&GU)
Bernie Pryor (Acting President
RSMU)
Dear Sir,
As a postgraduate 'fresher1
, with
experience of how other student
bodies are run, may I say that I am
in total agreement with Frank
James' letter in FELIX (no. 527). I
first encountered this incredible
state of affairs when I went to the
inaugural C&G union meeting in
my first week.
I was amazed how a group of
people of supposed above
average intelligence could behave
like absolute idiots. The events of
the meeting included holding a
coin in your crutch (having
previously pretended to stick it up
your asshole) and waddling down
some steps to drop it in a paper
cup. Was this practice really worth
taking up even a few minutes of a
normal humans life? The whole
process was ended in everyone
being instructed to chant some
mainly unintelligible nursery
rhyme.
Are these the events which
c o n t r i b u t e to the s o c i a l
development of students? Can
you therefore wonder at the
p u b l i c ' s attitude towards
students? Most of the students at
the meeting were freshers. I am
sure they are not all morons. But
from this meeting they were given
the impression from their 'peers',
that this is the way to behave. I am
sure losts of IC students would
like to get involved in more
important matters. The CCUs
should be a meeting place for
debate and a centre for organizing
action. The gulf between the
CCUs and the student movement
is shown by the fact that IC
sponsored a South African
student and a RSM team plays
rugby against white South
Africans!
Why don't we give Intelligent,
responsible and socially aware
behaviour a chance and make the
CCUs an agent for student
expression and not public
schoolboy pranks.
Yours faithfully,
Michael O'Connor
PG Social and Economic Studies
Dear Colin,
The two replies which were
published in the last FELIX in
response to my letter containing
various criticisms of the CCUs
(FELIX 527) made remarkably
interesting reading. Indeed I
found them so interesting that I
think they go a long way towards
proving my contention that the
CCUs are highly undesirable
institutions.
The anonymous letter sug-
gesting that serious consideration
should be given to my own
abolition is typical of the CCUs
reaction to anything with which
they disagree. That is a totally
unreasoning statement designed
to enforce conformity, but which
actually demonstrates how utterly
pathetic these C C U people are.
The other letter, by James Gray,
wonderfully illustrates how non-
intellectual the CCUs are - he
can't even read! Mr. Gray not only
ascribes to me views which I did
not include in my letter, but also
some which I do not even hold.
For example, he says, that I
believe that the CCUs ought to be
'nationalized' into ICU. He
continued by suggesting that I
would not be satisfied with that,
but would like to see one all-
embracing national students
union. Apart from the fact I never
said anything like this, I do not
hold these particular views. All I
suggested was that since the
CCUs appear to be in contraven-
tion of our by-laws serious
consideration should be given to
their abolition.
However, despite his inability to
read my letter and his consequent
failure to answer my points, I will
endeavour to answer the points
which he raised in his letter.
He suggested that the smoking
concerts are 'in moderation,
essential to the academic and
social development of the
student'. The trouble is they are
not held in moderation; it has
become increasingly apparent
this year that any suggestions of
moderation are simply rejected by
the CCUs though they attempt to
employ methods of concealment
and dis-information to hide their
contempt for those people who
have suggested moderation
In the case of sporting standards
and academic affairs, Mr. Gray
raises valid points. But it should
not be beyond the wit of man to
devise ways of retaining the
present status which these fields
enjoy at the same time do away
with those degrading aspects of
the C C U s w h i c h I have
highlighted. Indeed I would
suggest that by such action more
attention could be focused on
sporting standards and academic
affairs.
Finally, I should like to answer
Mr. Gray's suggestion that
reforms of the CCUs should come
from within rather than without. I
thus return to my analysis of the
tribal structure of the CCUs. By
enforcing certain taboos by the
degredation which the CCUs
imposes on its members, they
ensure that no serious innovation
will take place within the CCUs.
Since to suggest such a thing
would be to break the tribal taboo
and incur whatever wroth the
CCUs can inflict. Thus it is
impossible for reform to come
from within; it must be from
without.
Yours sincerely,
Frank James
PS
I presume that no letters from the
presidents of the CCUs imply
they are too afraid to have their
views published in FELIX.
