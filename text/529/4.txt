Dear Colin,
Re the current Rag Mag:
It sinks to depths from which it
never recovers starting with the
editorial. It is crude, racist and
•depraved. Perhaps the only good
thing about it, is that it has no
'page 3' type photographs, but
this is more than made up for by
the sick jokes and the crossword.
It is rather ironic that it is being
used to raise money for
handicapped people when it
makes fun of them.
Various people have commented
that since it is the Rag Mag, it
ought to be allowed to have a
certain licence but this one has
really gone too far. We believe in
taking a fairly open-minded view
of sex and other matters, but we
don't believe in making sick jokes
about handicapped people, or
producing a mag so blatantly
sexist or bigoted especially at a
place like IC, where sex and race
are rather touchy subjects.
It was interesting to notice, that
Mr Fox and Ms Rae Snee (Rag
Chairman) have disassociated
themselves from it, but really this
is not enough. The executive
should have acted as soon as they
realized what was happening
especially when the first lot of
printers refused to print it, due
to it being obscene. The excuse
that by the time they realized what
was happening it was too late, is
not acceptable because the
names of two of them are in the
editorial disassociating them-
selves from it. This really is not
good enough as it does (and will)
offend a lot of people and various
student committees are against it.
The view taken is that as it has
been produced, it has to be sold to
recover the cost. This depends on
whether you want to project the
image of IC students being
mindtess depraved zombies. They
really should have kept a better
eye on how the money was being
spent.
Although some of the jokes are
quite good the mag is really quite
obscene and it is rather a pity that
such an obviously talented person
as Mr Marshall should have
produced a Rag Mag without
foreseeing the obvious conse-
quences.

Dear Sir,
On Friday, 5th October; a poster
was hanged in College (a copy of
which is enclosed) claiming its
source as IC Islamic Society.
We have not issued this poster;
and it is well known to our
members that 1-2pm is our
FRIDAY PRAYER TIME, a weekly
event which continued since the
formation of the society. Firstly, I
would like to ask whoever played
such a childish trick to come out
in the open and state his views
clearly and not claim them on our
society. Secondly, I would like to
point out that the Society held a
lecture entitled, 'Facts and Events
About the Islamic Revolution in
Iran' given by Dr Abul Fazl Ezzatti
from the University of Tehran. A
copy of the poster is also included
(and will hopefully be published
with this article). This later lecture
did take place on 14th September.
May I point out our interst in Iran
at the moment. An Islamic
revolution supported by most
Iranians emerged. It ousted the
Shah who had the support of the
W e s t e r n w o r l d . K h o m e i n i
emerged as an undisputed leader.
Anyone who has read the Iranian
Constitution, and followed up the
events leading to the revolution;
.as well as after the revolution will
realize that the main aim was to
establish an Islamic State as an
independent system from others
such as communism, socialism,
imperialism, and secularism.
Women were at the forefront of
the revolution. Thus destroying
the popular myth that women are
suppressed under Islam. We pray
to God to guide the revolution in a
righteous path, so that it can
demonstrate the much needed
Islamic example as a complete
way of life: social, political,
economic, spiritual, as well as a
practical way of demonstrating
the law brought by the creator to
his creation.
May I remind non-Arab speaking
friends that Islam means
obedience and submission to God
- named Allah by the Arabs.
Finally, I would like to challenge
the offender mentioned at the
beginning of this letter, to come to
our next lecture and discussion
about Iran, and to stop being a
coward and uncivilized as
everyone is entitled to his viewl
Yours,
President of Islamic Social
Committee

Dear Sir,
I would like to comment on
Merche Clark's article on the
Corrie Bill in last week's FELIX.
Firstly, Merche Clark appears to
have signed herself as "ICWA
President" but I know that the
views expressed in her letter are
abhorrent to .many members of
ICWA. The usefulness of abortion
to women students is question-
able, and since it is the welfare of
these students that Ms. Clark
should be concerned with, then
surely she is abusing her position.
If she wishes to contribute such
articles to FELIX she should do so
either as an .individual student or
as a representative of the anti-life
societies such as the National
Abortion Campaign.
Her article opens by saying that
the 1967 abortion act entitles
women to abortions in certain
circumstances. This is not so. The
relevent wording of the act will
be found in chapter 87 section 1,
and I quote:
"Subject to the provisions of
this section, a person shall not be
guilty of an offence under the law
relating to abortion when a
pregnancy is terminated by a
registered medical practitioner if
two registered medical practi-
tioners are of the opinion, formed
in good faith "
The act then continues with the
frequently quoted circumstances
in which abortions may be
carried out. The wording of the
above excerpt does not give any
woman a right to abortion, it gives
a doctor the right not to be
prosecuted for performing an
abortion under certain circum-
stances. The difference is great. I
would suggest that when Merche
Clark writes any article in future
she gets the fact correct.
Ms. Clark's analysis of the four
main areas, as she defines them,
of the Corrie Bill is somewhat
faulty. For one thing, abortions
will not be illegal after twenty
weeks in cases of foetal
abnormality or where doctors say
that there are serious medical
grounds for the abortion. If the
one percent of abortions now
performed after twenty weeks are
only "the most desperate and
serious cases" then Ms. Clark
need not worry; such abortions
may still be carried out if the
Corrie Bill is passed.
The changing of the grounds for
abortion is primarily to return to
the 1967 bill in its original
meaning - or rather what the bill's
sponsors at the time claimed its
meaning to be. The wording was
very ambiguous and loose, so that
the conditions became meaning-
less. By going to "charities" like
BPAS virtually any woman can
have an abortion; the 1967 act has
become weak and meaningless
and many of its original
supporters are realizing that they
were hoodwinked into supporting
an act with deliberately loose
wording.
The BPAS and PAS "charities"
involved in the abortion industry,
are rightly worried about the
Corrie Bill. Their existence is
threatened. They can avoid this
problem if they cut all financial
and personnel links between the
agencies and the abortion clinics,
and then they will be allowed to «
continue. Perhaps what worries
them is the loss of one and a half
million pounds annual income,
not the fact that they will no longer
be able to provide women with a
"sympathetic service at a
reasonable price".
Ms. Clark then deals with the
rights of conscientious objectors;
she seems to believe that people
with a moral objection to abortion
should not work in the health
service. Yet theoretically this is a
civilized country - would we force
people to peform executions or
force nuns to administer drugs for
euthanasia? Abortion, Ms. Clark,
has nothing to do with the quality
of service a doctor provides for his
or her patients. A pregnant
w o m a n is two p a t i e n t s .
Finally, I would like to agree with
Merche Clark on one or two
points. "Have we the right to bring
children into a world when we feel
we cannot look after them -
though material reasons, social
pressures or whatever?" My
answer is that we have an
obligation to make the world a fit
place to bring the children into;
the children have a right to life. I
agree that women should be able
to control their own bodies; but
not if to do so they must kill
another human being. Most
women who have abortions have
already made the choice to risk
pregnancy, and the parents are
responsible for the child after
conception. Abortion is not about
whether women have a right to
control their bodies, but about
whether they have a right to
decide the future of another,
helpless human being. Abo^t
whether they have the right to kill
a child.
May I urge everybody who is
concerned about the present
misuse of the abortion act or
about the immorality of abortion
to write to their MPs requesting
them to vote for the Corrie bill in
F e b r u a r y ? I c a n s u p p l y
information on which MPs voted •
for and against the bill previously,
for anyone interested.
Yours faithfully,
Sean Kelly
