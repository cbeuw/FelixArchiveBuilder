STORM APPROACHING
NEXT TUESDAY'S
UGM
MOTION OF CENSURE
(extract taken from Monday's Exec News by kind permission of Roger
Stotesbury, ICU Hon. Secretary)
Proposed by: Kirsten Pratt
Seconded by: Barry Thyson
ICU Notes:
1: The existence of Apartheid in
South Africa.
2. That apartheid is a system which
embodies racism in its constitution.
3. That the so-called reforms do not
change the basic laws descrim-
inating against non-whites.
4. That the regime uses sporting
tours as an attempt- to gain
respectibility.
5. That there are over 30 laws and
regulations which prevent truly
multiracial sport being played.
6. That some members of RSMU
deceived the Metropolitan Police in
their booking of Imber Court.
7. That the Executive decided not to
stop the South African Team from
using College Bars, which is in total
contradiction to existing Union
Policy which states 'ICU thus
declares opposition to tours by
racially selected sports teams from
South Africa'.
ICU Believes:
1. No sporting links will be
acceptable between Britain and
South Africa until there is complete
democracy in South Africa.
2. That until such time, no College or
Union facilities should be made
available to South African Teams.
ICU resolves:
1. To censure the Executive for not
stopping a South African Team
using College Bars.
2. To support 'Stop all Racist Tours'
Campaign.
MOTION OF OCCUPATION
EDUCATION CUTS AND
OCCUPATION
ICU Notes:
1. The £55m Reduction in central
Government Expenditure on
Education of which £8m is in the
University Sector.
2. The proposed 6% cut in
Universities intake in 1980/81.
3. The £300m cut in the Rate support
Grant of 150m of which is expected
to be from LEA Education Budgets
4. The effect that this would heve on
grants especially in the distribution
of Discretionary Awards.
5. The 32% rise in Tuition Fees for
Overseas Students.
6. The likelihood that the
Government will try and implement
the 'Full Economic Cost' of
Overseas Students i.e. £2550.
7. The cut in Nursery School
Education from £5.9m to £4m (32%)
which is contrary to proposals in
the Conservative Manifesto.
8. The price rise in School Meals
from 25p - 30p and the reduction in
subsidised Transport which will
result in £200m saving for the
Government.
THe DES proposals for 'Education
into the 90's' i.e. the need for
expansion of the Tertiarty Sector to
accommodate 'the Bulge'.
10. The certainty of Continued Cuts
in future years with the possibility of
closures of institutions.
ICU Believes:
1. IC Students must involve
themselves in action against Notes 1
- 10.
2. There should be a large scale
Publicity and Education Campaign
starting with the IC Students.
3. That these cuts are one step in a
move to make education elitist and
only within economic reach of the
rich.
ICU Instructs:
1. The Union to Occupy a place in
College until it has received a
personal assurance from Maggie T
or Mark Carlisle that Government
Education Policy, especially
regarding the Tertiry Sector and
Overseas S t u d e n t s will be
completely reviewed or until such
times as the action is seen to have
made a suitable impact.
2. The Executive to write to all
Governors and Members of the
Board of Studies explaining that the
action is not directed specifically
against the college.
3. The Executive to write to the
Rector inviting him to join us.
4. That this motion be taken to ULU
SRC on 24th October urging other
colleges' support.
ICU Urges:
All students to supporTthese aims.
