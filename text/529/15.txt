By now, both of them had been formally introduced to the favorite
pastime of all students at the beginning of any academic
year....queueing. They queued to register; they'd queued for lunch;
they'd queued for their grant cheques (miraculously, both of theirs had
arrived intact and in full); they'd queued to join queues. At one stage,
Robin joined a queue simply because he'd begun to think it was a
genuinely edifying'experience. Anne certainly had some painful waits:
she'd had to queue for twenty minutes just to answer the call of nature.
Richard, one of Robin's new friends, nad reluctantly joined those
unfortunate few whose grant cheques fail to arrive on time. But here a
bit of I.C. tradition may be useful to him. If you find yourself in a similar
position, and happen to be in the Union Bar (when it' open) you may
become an unwitting victim of a nefarious group who've christened
themselves the 'Below the Handle' brigade. These philanthropic
gentleman, if they catch you holding a pint whose level of beer has
dropped 'below the handle' they will instantly dispossess you of your
glass, and before you can utter the first expletive which comes to your
lips, your glass will be promptly returned, full to the brim with the best
English ale!
Now it' time to return to our hero and heroine, who are at this moment
savouring the myriad delights proffered by the Fresher's Fair. This is
one of many opportunities in the year when you can witness what can
only be described as 'organised chaos'! As each ofthe hundred or so
College societies clamour for your custom, you may begin to wonder
just which one(s) to join.
Robin did join the War Games Club, for his secret ambition was to
emulate a certain Corsican who'd taken Europe by storm in the late
Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Centuries.
Anne joined Graffiti, a group who do not advocate that you waste your
creative energy defacing urinal walls, but rather that you make use of
them by learning to screem-print. Samaritan that she is, Anne also
offered her talents to Night-line, a volunteer organisation who answer
student S . O . S . c a l l s at a n y time of t h e night or day.
Now Richard, who was, for your information, a Post-graduate, was
one of those fellows who have developed a huge appetite for anything
even distantly related to the hop or grape family. As a result, he forced
himself to join the Wine-tasting Society. As a post-graduate (i.e. one of
those students who never stop telling you how they've been through it
all before) Richard automatically qualified to become a member of the
Postgrad group. Alas, the leaflet they sent him early in the term got
mislaid somewhere in the labrinths of the internal mail system, so he
only discovered the existence ofthe group when the letter finally turned
up in his pigeon hole just after Christmas. Robin had already
experienced some of the diabolical whims of the system: he would
frequently find letters addressed to him (his surname was Bignall) either
in the 'A' or the ' C compartments.
That same evening there was a choice of entertainments, as there
usually is on every night of the first week or term. There's often a film
show or perhaps a band playing somewhere in the college. If your idea
of vice does not consist of listening to some aspiring Tony Blackburn or
getting drunk in the Union Bar again, kthen you could always follow
Richard. The night before he'd gone over to the Collegiate Theatre in
Gordon Square to sample the delights of a musical evening care ofthe
University College. H e is always extolling the virtues of the London
night-life, which, headds, can cater forany vice or perversity you careto
mention. Indeed, Richard has some strong views on most things: HE
believes that students have less rights than illegal immigrants: that it is a
travesty of justice to expect students to live on a sum of money that's not
enough to feed a peasant in Bangla Desh: and that it is preposterous
that every man you meet in the street thinks that the taxes he pays are
all spent on keeping Y O U in education.
But that night, somehow he managed to drag Robin along to a folk
evening. Early on, the accumulated effect of flashing neon lights, an
atmostphere suffused with the fumes of intemperance, and a
cacophony loud enough to wake the dead, forced our hero to excuse
himself. He had migraine, and was in grave danger of contracting a long
list of u n p r o n o u n c a b l e a i l m e n t s , o r s o h e t h o u g h t .
Anne, who was there with City and Guilds', prolonged her carousal to
fifty-four hours. She had never drunk so much for so long for such effect
in all her seventeen years. This first week is indeed the time when
sizeable portions of one's grant disappear down the throat, only to be
expelled again at a later date.
As the night draws on, the conversations at these binges tend to lack
refinement....in fact, it degrades into downright vulgarity, which is
thought by all adolescents to be equivalent to man-talk.
These first few days that our heropersons were away from the
protection of their family were a kind of mirror of their new-found
independence. They were both compelled to make decisions, both
social and moral, that they had never had to make before. As a result,
areas of their personality, previously dormant, now made themselves
apparent. This is probably one of the main reasons why adolescence is
such a confusing time, for their decisions and actions have no
precedent, they have to be worked out from scratch. In this way, both
Anne and Robin would learn about themselves, their moral code, their
social awareness, and their political views.

Dear Sir,
ICU is no better than the
governments which it opposes.
ICU reels in horror at the
r e s t r i c t i o n s i m p o s e d by
Governments on people living
within the country and yet ICU
happily tries to restrict the
freedom of its own members. I
refer of course to attempts to
dissuade people from banking
with Barclays, working for South
African companies and playing
sports against South African
teams.
It is time that ICU realizes that
there are people who are capable
of independant thought which
may well differ from that of ICU. If
ICU does not do this then it had
better give up talking of freedom,
because at the moment it would
appear that ICU's idea is that you
are only entitled to freedom if you
are black and foreign.
Yours faithfully,
R J GLASS
