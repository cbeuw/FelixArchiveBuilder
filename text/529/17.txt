Thus were the first few chaotic days of University life for Anne, Robin
and their friends. Before then, their lives had been virtualy dominated by
their parents whose attitudes, convictions and prejudices were either
something to be despised or applauded, the more sensible approach is
to use them as a plumb-line in formulating a philososphy of life of their
own. For the auto-didact Robin, he had to beware of turning into that
strange breed of man, the confirmed academic, the man w h o lives his
life in an ivory tower, high above the whirligig of life, never tasting f w f or
bliss.
Being a girl, Anne's problems were of a different nature. Having learnt
to live with her womanhood, she had to learn to be a woman. What often
happens to girls like Anne in a University environment, is that they use
academia as a veil for their femininity, which tends to become
neglected. This danger is all the more real at a place like I.e., where only
the Sciences are taught. It is quite possible that Anne will, at some time
or another, experience some difficulty in reconciling her twin roles of
scientist and woman. 'Welcome to your first identity crisis', the poster
had said.
In general, the scientist is a peculiar fellow; sometimes exceptionally
practical and pragmatic, at others, he c a n fall foul of the scientists'
preferred pastime....excessive theorising. But the purpose of a course at
any educational institution is two-fold: fist, to train the mind to think
rationally, and second, to condition the student to conform to the status
quo. I daresay some will hotly dispute these conclusions, be that as it
may. S o m e m e n think t h e s e a is green, others call it blue.
Whatever happens, Anne and robin will never forget their Universtiy
days, and during the three year vigil, will forge many life-long
friendships.

OVERSEAS
STUDENTS
C O M M I T T E E
There was a meeting of the presidents of various
O S C a n d social societies o n the 5 t h O c t . T h e
following points arose: -
a) W i l l the following societies w h o have not
informed J e n ofthe names ofthe members of their
committees please d o so as soon as possible, the
societies are; L a t i n A m e r i c a n , A r a b , Iranian,
Bangledesh, A f r o - C a r i b b e a n a n d Pakistan.
b) Since the various national societies are
affiliated to O S C , will they please inform us when
they hold a meeting a n d also attend the O S C
meeting when invited or at least send a reasonable
excuse for not doing so.
c) W i l l the societies remove their m a i l from the
U n i o n Office a n d check at least once a fortnight, as
otherwise the m a i l will go into the bin. This is the
last warning.
Please pay attention to the points above, as it will
make life a lot easier.
Between Friday, 14th September a n d Tuesday,
2 n d October, about 220 overseas freshers used the
reception desk facilities r u n b y the College a n d
U n i o n O S C s .
Since the beginning ofthe term, quite a lot has
happened. There have been receptions b y t h e
I C C U , I C U O S C , Indian and Chinese Societies. It
was nice to see home students take part in these, but
we need a lot more help. There will be an informal
discussion every M o n d a y , i n the S C R from 6:30.
Everybody is invited, as we need help in getting
overseas students settled down. T e a a n d biscuits
are provided.
T h e College O S C held its reception for P G s on
Tuesday, 2 n d October. This was attended by the
rector, L o r d Flowers a n d his wife L a d y Flowers,
M r D i x o n (chairman o f I C O S C ) , M r Robertson
(welfare advisor a n d secretary o f I C O S C ) ,
members of O S C a n d various people providing
welfare a n d s o c i a l services f o r s t u d e n t s .
T h e rector, i n his address to the students, said
that h e wanted overseas students to be a n
indistinguishable part ofthe college and that they
were a n asset to the college, academically a n d
culturally. H e expressed disagreement with quota
system a n d fee increases. H e also hoped that while,,,
they were i n the U K , they could learn about
E n g l a n d , the English a n d their sense of fair play.
M r D i x o n , expressed similar hopes and said that
overseas students were held in high regard and h a d
a committee of their o w n . H e a n d M r Robertson
then introduced the students to various services
p r o v i d e d b y t h e C o l l e g e a n d U n i o n .
T h e y were obviously very sincere speeches, by
very helpful a n d hard-working people. I think,
however, that they were a trifle unrealistic. I do not
believe that overseas students c a n become a n
indistinguishable part of this or any college yet.
Q u i t e apart from the fact that there are language
problems a n d problems o f adapting to a different
culture, there is the quota system a n d fee
differentials. This government is also considering
raising fees to the mythical 'full economic cost'.
T h e language problem c a n be solved a n d . the
cultural exchange is mutually beneficial, but fees
are another matter. I f the fees are raised to the
'full economic cost' (approx ^2,300), the n u m b e r of
students will be limited to the very wealthy, but in
the end, it will be the British peopl e w h o will be the
losers. Overseas studen ts a t this college give
fascinating insights into their different culures,
they do a lot of the academic research (50% of P G s
are overseas students) a n d eventually when they go
back to their countries, they are more likely to
order British goods, as they are used to them a n d
k n o w the various ranges a n d services provided.
A c c o r d i n g to the L o n d o n conference on overseas
students, in association with U K C O S A and N U S ,
overseas students are subsidizing the economy to
the tune of ^50million a year. T h e conference takes
as its starting p o i n t , marginal rather than gross
costs, assuming that the education is for home
students, it calculates the extra costs to cope with
overseas students, M r Robertson said in eflecl that
their contribution was substantial a n d valuable
and i n fact some projects in some depart merits
would be hard, if not impossible, to manage
without them a n d of course these students bring
not only working time a n d energy, but ideas.
I believe that overseas students are an important
part o f College life a n d tfiat only by working
together a n d learning about each other will we In-
able to solve t h e p r o b l e m s f a r i n g us.
As the first U G M this year, M r Fox, I C U
President asked for support against fee iri< reaes.
There will fx' a picket ofthe D K S Office o n Friday,
12th October. Please give your support.

FILM REVIEW
LORD OF THE
RINGS
"This tale grew in the telling....", so begins
Tolkiens foreward to his best selling and
highly-praised classic, "The Lord of the
Rings". That was a trilogy, with the Hobbit, a
later-written prequel. This film "tells" the
story of the first book and a half, with a brief
summary of the Hobbit, and a second and
final film is due out next year.
Now, I say "tells" with reservations, as a
book of such proportions (over 900 pages) is
difficult to transpose to two, two and a half
hour films; but what the film lacks in detail,
it makes up for in animation, particularly
with the use of a new technique, by which
live-action is filmed and turned into a
cartoon, (excellent for the fast-moving
battles).
However, the true Tolkienophile will find
many flaws or differences with his/her
impressions of the characters and events.
For instance: is Gimli the dwarf, really only
six inches shorter than tall, proud Aragorn;
does Galadriel, the beautiful elfen queen, so
closely resemble a menopausal street-
walker; and why does Treebeard the Ent's
rear look like that of a bulldog.
The hobbits too, are rather akin to human
children, but the accents, especially lovable
gardener Sam's West Country burr, are I •
think, excellent. So too is the Jewish accent
given to Gollum, an unfortunate early victim
of the evil ring. (Imagine, if you can, Dickens'
Fagin saying, "We hate Bagginses, my
Precious!").
Nor will any mention of Tom Bombardil or
Aragorn's betrothed, Arwen Evenster be
heard, considerably pruning the events of
the first book.
It would be a waste to precis the story, as
the film already does, suffice it to say, it is a
quest to destroy a pretty powerful ring,
before its evil maker regains it.
To conclude, if you've already read the
book, this film fails somewhat on certain
levels, but is still technically very impressive
and if you haven't, then it'll be great fun.
