Hello again! _
Well, the past few days could be described as
less than uneventful. Some members of the
Union nearly made it on the cover ofthe 'Daily
Mirror' and the ensuing stink that followed
has managed to taint ICU just a bit.
There have been many social events
already, I've been drunk too many times
already (sorry all!) and the Freshers' Dinners
haven't even started yet. But just remember
there are still some posts of a more serious
nature which are not filled with candidates. If
you foster thoughts of contributing
constructively to the Union then come and
see myself or the other Officers and we'll talk
you into it. Academic Affairs Ordinary
Members and Elec. Eng. Dep.Rep. being
particularly ignored. Oh God, I hate writing
articles and here. comes the nasty bit.

So you thought you'd get away with it, but
here goes.
TODAY from 12:40ish people will be
gathering in the Beit Arch to go and picket the
DES in Waterloo over the Overseas Students
issues. IT IS IMPORTANT T H A T PEOPLE
ATTEND. It's not necessary for you to devote
all afternoon but it IS necessary that people
turn up and show they care.
For the rest see the report of the Joint Action
Meeting on the Cuts.
HARDSHIP
The details of the Hardship Fund
arrangements can be summed-up as:
'Applications for a fee remission on grounds
of hardship may be made by students
personally liable for all or part of their fees.'
'Eligible students wishing to be considered
can obtain a form from Registry (which is on
the third floor of the Sherfield Building).' Any
queries come and see me. It is important that
anyone in trouble does apply. If you have any
friends that are reluctant to apply, push them
over to see me.
TOWARDS T H E END
ICU is affiliated to Amnesty International
and participates in its 'urgent action' scheme
which involves writing letters and sending
telegrams seeking 'lost' peoples in the less
than Just countries. Well I have just got a
letter through which actually tells of the
recent successes of this scheme, which is a
nice way to finish the week.
Stay good!
CHRIS
The End.
Community Action
T h e C o m m u n i t y A c t i o n G r o u p has a few regular
activities y o u might be interested i n , but I've
repeated them so often recently that I feel like
giving it a miss today. Instead, I'll ask you to think
about what you could be doing, and how we could
help you get it together. So, if you come u p w i t h
something, C o m m u n i t y Actionish, that you want
help with organizing/cash, then get i n touch. A n d ,
if you really want to find out what we are doing,
then come along to one o f our meetings, M o n d a y
lunchtimes, a n d we might tell you. If you can't
make M o n d a y s , I should be a r o u n d the U n i o n
B u i l d i n g most other lunchtimes, possibly i n the
room o n the top floor where we keep our stuff (just
follow the signs).

Nigel R e d i t t has obtained honest employment;
not we hasten to add, entirely of his own volition.
After two years i n Physics (failed 2 n d year), Nigel
spent three years dossing i n the J e z Garage
supporting the fire engine. T h e one o r two other
things he has spent time o n are, of course,
unmentionable.
T h i s terrible state of affairs was bought about by
a joint effort o f his mother a n d elder brother
(speaks for itself). A n y o n e wishing to send

Flags at half mast and black arm-bands, please.
W e are especially interested in people w i l l i n g to

" L e t me bring you a l l things refined: G a l l i a r d s
and lute songs served in chilling ale." W e l l , if that's
what you want, don't go to the Anglesea, for all
that will be found is the " c h i l l i n g a l e " ; songs,
whether they be lute or jukebox are absent, as are
peanuts, crisps, straight glasses, space invaders a n d
fruit machines. W h y go to the Anglesea at all? T h e
reason must certainly be the R E A L A L E .
There has been a pub on the site ofthe Anglesea
ever since the area was developed in the eighteenth
century, and since then has passed through m a n y
changes. T h e most recent major change,
considered by some to be vandalism resulted in the
V i c t o r i a n bars (there were three) and screens being
removed and the b u i l d i n g o f t h e two bars present
now. T h e larger bar serves drinks, while the other
serves food at iunchtime. T h e p u b has been a free
house for a relatively short time; it was previously a
Ben T r u m a n tied house. A t that ime it was one of
the first pubs to introduce draught Guinness.
N o w to the most important part of any pub, the
beer. T h e Anglesea offers a selection of six real ales;
Wadworths 6 X , S a m Smiths O l d Brewery Bitter,
Ruddles County, Brakespears Best, Youngs Best
and Everards Tiger. D u r i n g the winter a ' W i n t e r
Ale' is introduced. T h i s year it is likely to be
Youngs W i n t e r W a r m e r . T h e ales are usually in
good condition, but occasionally a n 'off pint' m a y
occur. This is normally, the result o f a barrel
c o m i n g to an end. A l l ofthe ales are served from a
r a r e set o f s i x a n t i q u e h a n d p u m p s .
T h e most difficult part of d r i n k i n g i n the
Anglesea prices have not increased recently (apart
if you are not used to d r i n k i n g real ale.
Unfortunately there are n o 'ordinary' bitters to be
had, a n d those served tend to be strong i n both
alcohol content a n d taste. T h e R u d d l e s a n d
Wadworths are perhaps the strongest and also tend
to be the sweetest. T h e Brakespears Special is a
good bet if the decision is impossible, as it tends to
be constant in its taste; sweet but not too sweet. T h e
Sams is a matty pint tending to be a bit 'thick', the
Youngs is comparable to Brakespears, a n d the
T i g e r i s p e r h a p s t h e m o s t b i t t e r .
Food is only served at lunch time, the selection
offered is typical of m a n y pubs. T h e quality ofthe
food is good, especially the quiche a n d chilli
con carne. W i t h the ploughmans, you can have a
piece of cheese; either cheddar, camembert of blue
stilton.
T h e p u b attracts large numbers of people,
especially since it is in the C a m r a 'good beer guide'
and many tourist books. T h e p u b has thus two
characters, one a 'local' a n d the other being a n
attraction for real ale seekers. T h e former are
prevalent d u r i n g the lunchtime session a n d the
latter after about 7:30 in the evening. T o my m i n d ,
the p u b is a better place d u r i n g the m o r n i n g .
T h e pub is easy to find from college, it is a ten
minute walk down Queens Gate, straight across
the O l d B r o m p t o n R o a d into O n s l o w Gardens. It is
about two hundred metres o n the right from O l d
Brompton R o a d . T a k e my advice a n d give the pub
a visit, " A n d in thy joyous E r r a n d reach the Spot,
where I made one-turn d o w n a n empty glass!"
