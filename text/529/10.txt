JUST A SEC
SPECIAL
Insurance
If you live in College properly you will have
received, with your bill, a summary of two of
the policies (Halls of Residence Property and
Personal Injury). Please read this carefully
and keep for future reference. Should you
wish to make a claim, I can give you a form.
The chairman of the majorsub-committees
have sent to each club or society a property
insurance form. This is so a list of property
owned by a club or society can be assessed
for insurance purposes. I do urge those
concerned to return the form as soon as
possible. The importance of this is reflected
when one considers that only 60% of clubs
and societies are insured and even those are
mostly under insured.
Duplicating Demo
It just so happens, that NO ONE will be able
to use the Union duplicating facilities unless
they have attended a demonstration. Keys
will only be given to those one this elite list of
mine. There is now one last chance. The
Gestetners in the FELIX Office at 1:00pm on
Monday, will demonstrate to the world how
they should be used.
Environmental Week
This is going to be big, but in an attempt to
make it huge, there's an open meeting at
12:45pm TODAY in the ICWA Lounge. There
is a lot to discuss, so please, if you're
interested in topics to do with our
surroundings, turn up.
Union General Meeting
This is at 1:00pm on Tuesday in the Great
Hall. Unlike the last one this one is packed
with contentious motions, debate and
elections. If you care about the community
you live and study in - BE THERE PLEASE!
Parking Permits
The Unions Parking Committee met over
the weekend. Published here is the list of
those who have been granted permits.
If you are one of the lucky ones tnen you
may collect your permit from the Union
Office from Monday onwards. Permits will be
issued to successful applicants on
production of an authorized Union Card and
a log book corresponding to the vehicle and
the permit holder. For those unsuccessful
applicants you may wish to fill in an appeal
form which must be returned to the Union
Office by 5:00pm TUESDAY, 16th OCT.
The permit scheme comes into effect on
Monday, 22nd October. After this date, the
parking of cars not displaying permits will be
prohibited, and very naughty.

Second Week
Well that's all for now. I'll see all of you
Keoghians tonight at the dinner. Don't forget
to take along your sugar lumps and to aim
them at Baz.

La Societe Francophile
Fancy grape-picking in France next summer?
Do you like sangria parties? How about a party in
Paris? Would you like to meet French people? All
this and more could be yours chez-nous! We're a
newly formed society, so any suggestions for our
activities will be welcomed.
Come to our first meeting at 12:30pm on
Monday, 15th October, in the SCR in the Union
Building.
Our first major event will take place on Friday,
2nd November, in the Union Concert Hall and will
be a sangria party with discotheque and live rock
band.
