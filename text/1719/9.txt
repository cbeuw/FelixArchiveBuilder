Review: Kohncertino
W
ell, Imperial
unquestion-
ably has no
shortage of
orchestras, bands or music
groups. However, there’s
a new orchestra which has
been growing in the past
few months: Kohncertino.
Led by first-year maths
student Michael Kohn,
Kohncertino held its
debut concert on Saturday
16th
March, at St Gabriel’s
Church, Warwick Square
in Pimlico.
To begin the concert - a
musical journey around
Europe (before we leave)
- Kohncertino performed
the ‘Hebrides’ Overture’
by Felix Mendelssohn.
Commencing Mendels-
sohn’sworkaboutFingal’s
Cave with a polyphonic,
wholesome contribution
from the violas, cellos
and bassoons, a refined
sense of the bucolic and
wondrous nature of the
setting by which this work
was inspired was instantly
created. Conversely, the
entire orchestra came into
play to create an equally
potent sense of the choppy
waters and formidable
nature of the seas sur-
rounding the Hebrides;
the dynamic transition
from peaceful melody to
fortissimo, forceful waves
was particularly well
executed.
Following this,
time for violin soloist
Silke Nodwell to take
centre-stage, as the
orchestra diminished in
size for Mozart’s ‘Violin
Concerto No. 5 (The
Turkish)’. Once again the
orchestra’s performance,
this time with Silke on
the violin, resonated with
clear passion and deep
understanding of each
of the three movements.
Then were the moments
when Silke played solo.
Engaged with the music
and clearly very inde-
pendent, Silke not only
ensured that justice was
done to the vast array of
moods and feelings that
this concerto encompass-
es, but also that a personal
touch of true passion was
injected into the perfor-
mance.
Drawing the evening
(as well as the musical
journey around Europe)
to a conclusion was Men-
delssohn’s ‘Symphony
No. 4’ (Italian). Starting
with vigour and gusto,
Kohncertino fully
captured the joyful,
lively mood of the first
movement.Then,themore
sombre air of the second
and third movements was
replicated to considerable
effect. Finally, to conclude
the entire evening, the
final movement (presto)
was performed. For the
last time, Michael and the
entire orchestra invested
their fullest gusto and
energy into depicting a
sense of overwhelming
excitement. The final
flourish: the crescendo to
the end. One final burst
of energy testament to the
evening’s success.
Behind the orchestra’s
formidable work is the
conductor and director
himself, Michael Kohn.
Being his debut as a con-
ductor; as with anyone’s
debut in anything, one
could forgive Michael
for feelings of nervous-
ness. However, from the
moment of entry, Michael
exuded a full aura of con-
fidence and control. This
followed through into
the concert; any member
of the audience could
sense Michael’s clear
command over the music.
Unfailingly attentive and
genuinely engaged with
the music, one could
see Michael constantly
attending to the orchestra,
be it the entire group or
just a single section; and
who could miss the true,
infectious passion he had
for the music of the night,
which passed onto the
orchestra?
Having seen Kohncer-
tino’s first concert,
Kohncertino seems to be
a young yet vibrant force
in the London classical
music scene. Before
long, Kohncertino has the
potential to be something
much bigger. And certain-
ly worth going to the next
concert.
