themselves debating GM
crops as the delegate of
China (finally something
relevant to their degree!).
The highlight of the
weekend was undeniably
watching the creative pun-
ishmentsdistributedbythe
Chairs which ranged from
leading a committee-wide
yoga session to giving an
impromptu presentation
on ‘The History of the
Slut Drop’. Surprisingly,
IFAD actually did get
some work done and the
committee passed a res-
olution co-sponsored by
yours truly.
We also had a delegate
in the International Court
of Justice, which is the
UN’s court for settling
disputes between coun-
tries and is notorious for
being populated with
Law students seeking
to flex their knowledge
of international law. As
the only non-law student
there, our delegate was
the advocate of the USA,
responsible for defending
the US against Iran’s pros-
ecution. Basically, during
the Iran-Iraq war, the
US shot down a civilian
Iranian plane killing
290 civilians, possibly
accidentally or possibly to
flex their military muscle.
Weird flex but okay. Our
delegate had to convince
the 15 judges that killing
290 people is legal under
international law by
looking for loopholes in
treaties. We lost the case
but at least we convinced
four judges that what the
US did was legal. Interna-
tional law is scary.
Our delegate in the
Maritime Committee
found that representing
China on the subject of
Maritime trade is like
representing the US on
freedom, everybody
either loves you or hates
I
mperial College
Model United
Nations sent twelve
of its finest delegates
(and two chairs!) off to
Europe’s biggest MUN
conference, LIMUN. We
showed up bright-eyed
and eager on Friday after-
noon, ready for what we
knew would doubtlessly
be a great weekend. And
boy were we right! It was
a weekend filled with long
hours of debate, endless
reunions with friends
from previous confer-
ences (half of whom you
still call by the country
they represented the first
time you met - because
who has time to learn
actual names at MUN),
and a black-tie ball where
enough indiscretions
were spotted to ignite the
committee gossip boxes
the next day.
Our delegate in the
Security Council heatedly
debated the situation in
the Korean Peninsula.
As the delegate of China,
he spent most of his time
trying to reach a deal
with the fierce delegates
of the US and France. In
the end, an agreement was
not attained and vetoes
fell on both sides; luckily,
however, they managed to
solve their differences at
the ball, establishing supe-
riority through a decisive
council dance-off.

you. China was probably
the most used word
throughout the entire
weekend. They ended up
passing two resolutions
on the environment and
trade, where surprisingly
the developing world
ended up having its way
by rivalling the European
point of view.
especially when you
are China and everyone
has constant questions,
concerns and demands.
Luckily, the conference
ended with their draft
resolution passing with a
large majority of votes to
the great surprise of the
other block (seeing them
rage was quite satisfy-
ing!!)
In its first ever session
at LIMUN, The Inter-
national Civil Aviation
Organisation promised to
fly delegates high in the
search of a solution for
global growth in aviation
(even in the absence of
aeronautical engineers).
The finale to three hectic
days didn’t disappoint,
with a spectacular swing
of opinion seeing our
Chinese delegation earn
a supermajority on a res-
olution co-sponsored with
Russia and South Africa,
and the German delegate
ending up voting against
his own draft!
All in all, once again,
LIMUN did not disap-
point and was unanimous-
ly viewed as a spectacular
weekend by everyone who

Sunday afternoon: Don’t be fooled, their smiles are hiding all their cumulative hango-

Our delegate in the
International Fund for
Agriculture Development,
lovingly called I(FAM)
by the committee, found
attended. ICMUN would
like to extend a big con-
gratulations to everyone
who made it to the con-
ference, as a delegate or a
chair and, in particular, to
the five Imperial students
who received commenda-
tions or awards. LIMUN
is, unfortunately, the last
conference of the year,
however, we will be
attending both OXIMUN
and CIUMUN early next
term (both conferences
offer beginner commit-
tees!!), and so we really
encourage anyone inter-
ested to join us next year!
The Special Political
and Decolonisation Com-
mittee or SPECPOL’s
topic of debate was the
Belt and Road Initiative,
which our delegate found
got extremely intense,

onday 25th
F e b r u a r y
m a r k e d
the start of
‘Believe and Do Good’
(BADG) 2019. BADG
is a campaign where
Muslim Medics and
Imperial Islamic Society
collaborate to dedicate a
week to doing good to our
local community. Inspired
by a verse from the Quran:
“Indeed, those who have
believed and done right-
eous deeds - they will have
the Gardens of Paradise
as a lodging” [107 - Al-
Kahf], our volunteers set
out to make a difference
in the community.
We started off with our
exclusive BADG styled
Shake Break, where the
line-up of amazing events
were launched (and we all
enjoyed some delicious
takeaway and cake!) We
heard from the Heads
of each event, and the
buildup of hype began!
We couldn’t wait to get
see what amazing oppor-
tunities BADG would
bring.
The week kicked off
with a stall in the SirAlex-
ander Fleming Building.
Students and staff alike
were encouraged to
pledge a small creative
act of kindness, such as
brightening up someone’s
day. They were given a
certificate and a goody
bag too!
On Tuesday, a group
of eager medical students
brought sweet treats and
friendly faces to elderly
patients at Charing Cross
Hospital. The patients
were delighted to have
visitors and engaged in
joyful conversation.
The next day consisted
of something a little differ-
ent. Enthusiastic students
got stuck in (literally!)
and worked together to
clean up a community
garden in Chelsea.
On Thursday, an al-
truistic group of students
donated blood at a nearby
blood donation centre.
There was also a stall in
the Sir Alexander Fleming
Building to encourage
signups. It was lovely to
see so much involvement
from students, especially
as blood donation has the
potential to make a great
difference to those in
need.
Next up, Saturday
brought a first-term
event for Imperial
BADG. Medical students
delivered a talk about
diabetes and health
awareness, in an effort to
increase knowledge about
common diseases in our
community. The attendees
benefited greatly, from
receiving blood pressure
checks and information
(with some of them even
making notes!).
And last but certainly
not least, Sunday saw our
first ever Homeless Drive
in collaboration with
KCL and LSE. Hygiene
packs as well as food
and essential items were
distributed to those in
need in Holborn. It was
amazing to see our vol-
unteers getting involved
with the homeless.
Taking part in BADG
always serves as a good
reminder that outside of
the bubble of our own
lives, there are local
communities and groups
of people that can often
use our help. Too often
we become focused on
how we can make massive
changes to the world and
solve the big issues; and
in the process we forget
about the little things
around us.
We would like to
thank everyone who
got involved, be it from
pledging a creative act
of kindness at the stalls,
creating hygiene packs to
distribute to the homeless,
or simply spreading the
word about this campaign.
We couldn’t have done
it without you, and we
look forward to further
opportunities to serve our
community together.
Belly Dancing Summer Workshop: Polynesian Fusion
T
he Belly Dancing
Society hosts
weekly classes
in Autumn &
Spring Terms however,
during the summer, due
to many of our members
having exams, we pause
our courses in favour of
workshops. These 2-hour
sessions are designed to
expand the horizons of
our members, by intro-
ducing them to new sides
of belly dancing, but are
also suitable for beginners
to the style, even if you’ve
never danced before! Our
summer workshop series
this year kicks off with
Polynesian Fusion Belly
Dance next Friday.

When: 18:00-20:00, Friday 10th

Where: Meeting Rooms 1&2, Floor 1, Union Building
Tickets: £12 for members, £15 for non members – on the door or on the
Union website
School (FEDS) to give
this workshop. The FEDS
is a London-based belly
dance school offering
a range of classes, both
in person and online.
We hire their teachers to
teach our traditional belly
dancing classes, and we
invited them to give one
of our workshops when
we found out about this
fun new theme! If you’re
interested in finding
out more about FEDS,
you can check out their
website www.fleurestelle.
com for more information.
Inspired by their
recent travels to Rapa
Nui (Easter Island), the
FEDS has developed an
Island Fusion workshop.
It combines some of the
belly dance classics from
their syllabus with tropical
moves and techniques to
give unique fusion that
creates sunshine in class!
Rapa Nui is just one of
the 1,000+ islands within
Polynesia, and so they’ve
drawn inspiration from
many of the different
dance styles across this
archipelago. If that sounds
like fun, join Shaddy next
Friday and be immersed
in that tropical feeling!
We hope you’ll join us
for this workshop – if you
can’t make it but are still
interested in learning to
belly dance with us, we
have a swords workshop
on 21st
May, a belly-hoop
class on 4th
June and a
“vintage combos” tribal
fusion workshop on 18th
June. Email bellydanc-
ing@imperial.ac.uk for

You can follow us on
social media to keep up
