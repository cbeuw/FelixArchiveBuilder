Students invited to
share their input on
methods to improve
access for students
from widening
p a r t i c i p a t i o n
backgrounds
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
Imperial College and
the Union jointly held
an open forum discussion
on its plans to improve
access for students from
widening participation
(WP) backgrounds.
The meeting took place
from 12:00 - 13:00 in
Meeting Room 3 in the
Union Building and was
attended by many of the
Liberation Officers, as
well as representatives
from the Union, includ-
ing Deputy President
(Welfare), Becky Neil and
C
oncerns have
been raised by
students about
the Move Out
Day for first year hall
residents. In previous
years, Move Out Day
has always fallen on the
last Saturday of term
(which would be 29th
June), but this year it
has been pushed up to
Thursday 27th
June.
This will not affect the
Move Out Day Concerns Addressed by College
schedules of first years as
College has planned the
end of term for first year
undergraduates to be 26th
June. College has ensured
that first year exams
have ended by this date
and that there is minimal
teaching during this time.
However, for non-first
year students whose end
of term date is 28th
June;
these students living in
halls have been contacted
by Campus Services and
Student Services and will
provide them assistance
if this presents complica-
tions for them.
The 27th
June move-
out date was stated in all
accommodation contracts,
so residents were well
aware of the date, although
first year students may be
unaware of the deviation
from past convention and
reasons behind it.
When approached
for comment, a College
spokesperson said the fol-
lowing: "We have taken
steps to make sure disrup-
tion to students in halls is
kept to a minimum. We
have communicated this
consistently throughout
the year including with
a ‘Are You Ready?’ pub-
licity campaign across
all campuses, so that
residents can ensure plans
are in place with plenty
of notice. We understand
that a very small number
of students who are not
first years but are living
in halls may be affected
by the change. Should
students have any queries,
we encourage them to get
in touch”
The change of Move
Out Day to Thursday is
in parallel to a change in
organisation of this year’s
Imperial Festival, which
will be collaborative in
nature for the first time,
with 19 other cultural
institutions taking part.
The partnership with
other institutions imposes
constraints on schedule
flexibility and, as a result,
the Imperial Festival,
usually held in April/May,
will be on 28th - 30th
June this year (and will
be named The Great Ex-
hibition Road Festival to
reflect the collaborations).
Plans for the Festival
include Exhibition Road
being closed off, blocking
vehicular access. Thus, to
avoid potential logistical
difficulties for students
vacating the halls and
for the Festival, College
moved forward the date
at which hall residents
are required to move out.
Though this logistical
conflict would only affect
accommodation halls in
South Kensington, the
accommodation contracts
for the nine first year halls
are affiliated, so the same
Move Out Day applies to
all first year halls.
Furthermore, these
halls will open for
commercial bookings
(offering bed-and-break-
fast accommodation) on
Saturday June 29th
(in
past years they open on
the first Monday after
term ends), possibly to
accommodate for an
influx of visitors during
the Festival weekend.

Voice, Emelie Helsen.
This meeting comes
as the College is in the
process of writing its
Access and Particiption
Plan, which is a document
they must write for the
Office for Students by
23rd
May, outlining what
College is going to do to
ensure that they are ac-
cessible to students from
a widening participation
background and that they
are supportive to those
students while they are at
Imperial so they achieve
good graduate outcomes.
The plan is mostly about
undergraduate home
students and widening
participation backgrounds
refers to BME (Black and
minority ethnic) students,
disabled students, students
from a low household
income, students from low
participation neighbour-
hoods, mature students,
care leavers and students
from state schools.
Elements of the plan
were presented by Dr.
Malcolm Edwards,
Director of Strategic
Planning, and this was
followed by time for ques-
tions and discussion, in
which those in attendance
were given the opportuni-
ty to provide feedback.
Methods of improv-
ing access, including a
focus on BME students
and socio-economically
disadvantaged students,
and replicating programs
such as Pathways to Med-
icine and STEM potential
programs outside London
through a digitally-deliv-
ered pilot program, were
discussed at length. The
College is also consider-
ing launching a program
in London specifically for
Black students.
Data suggests that
Imperial performs well in
terms of attracting black
applicants but performs
poorly in terms of admit-
ting them, which could be
indicative of unconscious
bias present in the admis-
sions process.
Another consideration
that needs to be taken into
account is the apparent
"attainment gap" which
exists for BME and WP
students, and ensuring
measures are also in place
to tackle this.
College has been
described as "keen to get
feedback from a diverse
group of students on the
plan".
Work surrounding
improving access is
ongoing and largely
already underway. On
9th
April, Imperial sent
a cohort of staff and
students to run a stall at
the REACH Society's 10th
Annual Careers Event, an
event specifically aimed
at Black students aged
13 - 25 to provide advice
about their future aspira-
tions. For the past three
years, the conference has
attracted over 2000 Black

students and have estab-
lished strong links with
the Amos Bursary and
several universities, in-
cluding UCL, Brunel and
Durham University. This
was the first time Imperial
has been in attendance at
the conference and was
described as a chance to
"show that Black British
individuals have a place at
elite universities."
