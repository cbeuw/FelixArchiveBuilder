he ride haling
app has lowered
its expectations
from a rumoured
IPO valuation of around
$100 billion to between
$80-90 billion. This would
still be the largest public
offering from Silicon
Valley since Facebook,
with the company pitch-
ing an initial price range
of $44 to $55, even as
many other highly valued
tech companies such as
Slack enter the public
domain. Many believe this
conservative pricing is a
result of the underwhelm-
ing stock performance of
competitor Lyft, which
is currently trading 20%
below its issue price after
it went public earlier this
year. Lyft is in fact threat-
ening a lawsuit against
Morgan Stanley (one of
the underwriters of the
IPO) after its alleged role
in helping market certain
products that would help
pre-IPO investors bet
against the stock which
certain traders believe
caused the early drop in
share price.
A Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman told CNBC
“the firm did not market
or execute, directly or
indirectly, a sale, short
sale, hedge, swap or
transfer of risk or value
associated with Lyft stock
for any Lyft shareholder
identified by the company
or otherwise known to
us to be the subject of a
Lyft lock-up agreement.”.
Interestingly, Morgan
Stanley are lead under-
writers of the Uber initial
public offering, in con-
junction with Goldman
Sachs and Bank of
America. This raises that
eternal question; do banks
represent the client or the
investors and how do they
Uber’s IPO documents
show how it has been
spending heavily, burning
through $2.1bn in cash in
2018, maintain market
share. Its not surprising
that there are serious
questions about Ubers
profitability.
Another comparative
example could be Snap,
who went public for $24
billion in early 2017,
listing on the New York
Stock Exchange at $17 per
share. Now two years later
the shares trade at roughly
30% below the listing
price. One might ask then
why Uber wants an IPO at
all, when there appears to
be clear evidence similar
firms have failed to raise
predicted funds in the
public market. It could be
because chief executive
Dara Khosrowshahi, and
four other top executives
have options for nearly 4m
shares, a strong incentive
for them to move quickly
into an IPO.
It may also be that they
have exhausted private
investment sources after
Softbank’s vision fund
injected $7.7bn into Uber
in January 2018 to become
the largest shareholder.
However, what is
interesting is thatAlphabet
and Saudi Arabia’s Public
Investment Fund are
not selling any of their
shares in the IPO. This
tells us they still believe
there is potential for
future growth, and that
they are willing to deploy
capital to maintain their
investment if necessary.
This provides Uber was
a unique cushion, an
advantage for smaller,
newer investors.
Uber has also remained
very ambiguous about
its key metrics. Analysts
use these to build models
and forecast future
growth of a company. For
example, the company has
decided not to disclose
what the breakdown is
of passenger rides and
restaurant deliveries
is. Consequently, this
makes investors sceptical
over whether Uber can
be accurately valuated.
Despiteallofthesefactors,
Bloomberg was reporting
as this article was written
that the Uber IPO was
oversubscribed by day
two of the roadshow, with
meetings in London on
Monday and New York on
“Softbank’s
vision fund

$7.7bn into
Uber in
January 2018
to become
the largest
shareholder.”
manage these conflicts of
interest? Uber has already
warned that existing
shareholders might enter
into hedging deals that
would hurt its share price.
Furthermore, in almost
all respects, Uber is in a
worse financial position
then Lyft. It is growing
at a much slower rate,
with Uber’s Take Rate,
the percentage of gross
bookings it captures as
core platform adjusted net
revenue, has been steadily
in decline throughout
2018. Uber has also de-
clining market share with
no real competitive ad-
vantage that will allow it
to earn a sustainably high
return on invested capital
(a key metric investor
use when investing in a
company). Despite this

tell how the initial public
offering goes this month
but observers will be
watching this bellweather
offering carefully.
