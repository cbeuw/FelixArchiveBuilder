O
n Wednesday
10th
April, Felix
attended a
roundtable dis-
cussion on the perceived
barriers of women in the
UK to joining the tech
industry.
The event was jointly
hosted by HP and The
Fawcett Society, the
UK’s leading organisation
campaigning for equality
between women and
men, and drew upon an
independent HP-commis-
sioned study to find out
why the industry struggles
to attract women and what
can be done to help.
George Brasher,
Managing Director of HP
UK & Ireland chaired
the event and, following
housekeeping and a
welcome, introduced the
plan for the session and
opened the floor for those
in attendance to contrib-
ute. Addressing the group,
he said: “As a company,
we feel that diversity
creates benefits for us. But
if you look at the numbers,
we have the same issue
that the industry does - in
that women are underrep-
resented. Words are inter-
esting but actions create
results.”
There were represent-
atives from business,
media and government at
the roundtable and Vicky
Ford, MP for Chemlsford,
provided an update on
what the government is
doing to tackle the issue:
“We know that tech
and entrepreneurship
are linked, but less than
a penny in the pound
goes to all-women busi-
nesses compared to 89p
to all-male businesses.
That’s why Government is
putting more money into
start-up loans. They’ve
put £1m into another
fund, and £20m into the
institute for coding’s di-
versity project.” However,
she also added, “it’s got to
be led by business”.
Sam Smethers, Chair
of the Fawcett Society,
then took over chairing
duties, adding, “Part of
the problem is where we
stereotype what’s normal
for girls. If we don’t get
in at that early stage, we
are swimming against the
tide.” To spark initial con-
versation, she then invited
everyone at the discussion
to contribute one sentence
on what they would
change to get more young
women into tech. Sam’s
sentiments were largely
echoed, with many people
highlighting how crucial
it is to “strike early” in the
lives and careers of young
women. Debbie Forster,
Chair of Tech Talent
Charter added: “I’m from
an education background
so I completely agree that
it’s important. George
alluded to the fact that
there’s a problem with
women who ‘didn’t catch
the right flight’ - how do
we do retraining and move
women from consumers to
creators. Tech desperately
wants women, and 50%
say they would retrain.
Claire MacDonald
from Computer Weekly
concurred, stating: “there
needs to be more of a
focus along the entire
pipeline. Even if young
women follow a tech path,
they often find that it’s not
the inclusive environment
they want or need”.
Many recurring themes
were discussed, especially
the topic of effective re-
training, maternity leave
and how to effectively
collaborate with schools
and the education sector
to tackle this issue. When
the topic of representation
at senior positions in tech
companies was raised, it
opened up an interesting
debate about the use of
quotas. Ultimately, the
roundtable discussion
succeeded in providing a
platform through which
ideas could be shared and
the issues were able to be
discussed in an open and
fruitful manner.
After the roundtable
discussion, Felix spoke
to HP Graduate, Steph
Audeh, and HP intern,
Vera Hansen, who started
working at HP in January
2019 and July 2018,
respectively, about their
experiences working in
tech.
How has it been so
far? What’s your
experience been as an
intern/ graduate?
Steph: It’s been great.
I’ve had some serious
exposure to amazing
projects in sustainability,
in diversity, on innova-
tion. I’ve had a wealth
of opportunities in three
months. It’s a little bit
insane, in a great way.
Vera: It’s been great.
My role is supporting
George, the Managing
Director, and his Chief of
Staff and his Executive
Assistant. It’s a great
role. Like Steph, I’ve had
a range of experiences
and exposure. I’ve been
working on Brexit, I’ve
been working on a lot of
things, it’s a really broad
role that I love.
What’s been the
highlight?
Steph: The highlight
so far is the work I’ve
been doing with diversity
actually. It’s one of my
passions and we’ve been
working closely with
Debbie from Tech Talent
Charter. We’ve been to
a couple events, now we
have this, and I think,
because it’s one of my
passions, it’s one of my
highlights, working in
programs to increase
awareness on diversity
and women in tech.
What would you say is
the biggest challenge
you’ve faced both
in working here but
then also in increasing
awareness about
diversity like you
mentioned?
Steph: I think it’s when
I arrived, it’s quite a steep
learning curve. You’ve
got to go and you’ve got
to absorb a lot of informa-
tion and understand what
companies are doing and
best practice. It’s complex
and to get your head
around it in such a short
space of time to get up
to speed was quite tricky.
So I think one of my
challenges is absorbing all
the information and then
taking a logical approach.
Vera: In terms of chal-
lenges, I agree, it’s kind
of the onboarding and the
taking everything in but
then I think, especially
at HP, we have a lot of
support. We have mentors,
we have our managers, no
one ever says no really, if
you ask for help.
From the discussions
had today, what
would you say is your
main take home
message?
Steph: My main take
home message was col-
laboration actually. I think
the fact that companies
shouldn’t be doing it in
silos, whether you’re
competitors or you’re
from different areas in the
tech background or other
backgrounds, it’s the fact
that the only way we
can move is all together.
That’s my key take-away;
and the fact that it needs
to be sustainable and
scalable. It’s not a short
term thing.
Vera: It’s slightly con-
tradictory. Like you said
about collaboration and
partnership, that’s really
important but then I loved
a point that George made
that tech is such a compet-
itive industry and starting
putting metrics on things
will really bring change
because, if HP starts
getting public measures
on diversity, then other
firms will try to compete,
given the nature of the
sector. I think that would
really make a boost, if
everyone starts publically
putting more measures on
the subject.
Finally, what sort of
advice would you give
to women to get to a
job in HP or a job in
tech?
Steph: Be open to op-
portunities. When I started
applying for placement,
Retraining could bring more women into the tech indus-

because I was an intern
at HP, I didn’t actually
consider tech. I almost
stumbled into it and it was
being open to it; I had a
bit of reservation – do I
go, do I not? Just do it, see
what it is, you might love
it. It’s the fact that, maybe
when I was going through
education, I wasn’t open
to those sort of oppor-
tunities - you can have a
job in a tech company in
a non-technical capacity.
Try and experience as
many sectors as possible
and just be open to
it because you might
stumble on a passion
you’ve never realised.
Vera: I think I have
to agree. Like Steph, I
stumbled into tech and,
because in my course
[Business Management] a
placement is compulsory,
I was applying to a wide
range of sectors and
slowly the applications
I was getting further in
were all in tech. I was
really surprised. It’s
taken me down this path
but I’m really loving it.
The dynamics and the
fast-pace of this sector
is amazing. You always
feel at the forefront so I
really encourage people to
joining the tech industry;
tech or non-technical
jobs, it’s a really good
experience.
