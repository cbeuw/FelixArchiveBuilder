T
wo years have
passed by since
Jordan Peele’s
directorial debut,
Get Out. It was a critical
and commercial success
and earned Peele an Oscar
for Best Screenplay. I
love Get Out. The thrill
of riding this rollercoaster
of a movie in a packed
screeningwasoverwhelm-
ing. Peele impressively
toyed with the audience
with suspense and laughs;
the fine balance of horror
and comedy was expertly
executed. In addition to
all of this, Peele weaved a
satirical thread of system-
atic liberal racism into the
plot. Spotting the subtle
imagery and throwaway
foreshadowing statements
were like a treasure
hunt. It was satisfying to
unearth little nuggets of
context and meaning in
conversation with many
friends who enjoyed it as
much as I did. It was the
balance of racial subtext
with fantasy horror which
created a film with main-
stream appeal. With the
bar set high, is Us as good
as it should be?
Us centres on Adelaide
(Lupita Nyong’o), her
husband, Gabe (Winston
Duke), and their children
Zora and Jason (Shahadi
Wright Joseph and Evan
Alex), who are on a trip
to their beach house in
Santa Cruz. During her
childhood, Adelaide
went missing on holiday
at the fun fair in Santa
Cruz, where she recalls
seeing her doppelgänger
in a hall of mirrors.
Adelaide is reminded of
her childhood trauma and
becomes increasingly
fearful when coincidences
begin happening. Indeed,
things take a turn south
when Adelaide’s family is
confronted by their dop-
pelgängers with sinister
intentions.
Firstly, the film takes
its time to develop
Adelaide and her family
thoroughly. It provokes
a lot of sympathy for the
central characters, which
is where the horror stems
from. When things go off
the rails, we care about the
characters — but it lacked
jeopardy. As intense as
the horror was, the film
was too sympathetic for
its characters. The twists
and revelations of the plot
were contrived yet pre-
dictable, but on the verge
of forgivable because it
was still enthralling to see
it play out.
tively done, from Michael
Abels’ chilling orchestral
rendition of Luniz’s ‘I got
5 on it’, to the direction

sequence.
and the film’s vagueness
allows for different inter-
pretations. It makes for a
thought-provoking watch,
even though the focus
is muddied. Likewise,
the tone of the film is
confused too. The sparse
moments of humour
didn’t always fit into the
overall horror tone as
well as it should have, and
often felt like a heavy foot
on the brake in the pro-
gression of the narrative.
Having said that, I loved
the mystical quality of the
film akin to a Grimms’
fairy-tale, with a darkly
sweet streak of malice
running through its veins.
This balance of morbidity
and enchantment is beau-
tifully complementary in
the final act, where the
sombre tone felt ajar with
the rest of the film.
Us is not a film about
race. Sure, there are
thematic elements and
imagery that could point
to a racial subtext, but
nowhere is the race
of Adelaide and her
family made to be their
defining characteristic.
As someone who made
a seminal American film
like Get Out, I believe that
Peele’s deviation from
racial politics is the next
step towards equality in
the industry and beyond,
as contradictory as that
sounds. Allow me to
explain.
of minorities was for films
to highlight the historical
and systematic racism.
The plot of these ‘phase
one’ black movies often
centred around a character
to overcome obstacles
that were set by their
race. The characters were
defined by the colour of
their skin; their African
heritage was built into
the narrative. From recent
times, think 12 Years A
Slave, Moonlight, Hidden
Figures, BlaKkKlansman
and Get Out. These are
important movies in doc-
umenting and celebrating
the African American
identity, but it’s becoming
increasingly ironic that
talented black actors are
pigeon holed into certain
roles. Sometimes, a
product of this system is
the black-character-to-fu-
el-a-white-narrative-film
(I’m looking at you Green
Book).
Now, in response
to the disproportional
representation in cinema,
mainstream movies are
starting to make room for
people of colour on screen
and behind the camera.
With this, we get diverse
filmmakers championing
an underrepresented
wave of talent allowing
non-white actors to take
on exciting and complex
roles that traditionally
could have been a white-
male-lead. This new
attitude towards casting
transcends race and
would portray non-white
characters, without the
colour of their skin being
a plot point. It is ‘phase
two’, if you will, of black
representation in Holly-
wood. By extension, we’d
hope to see this kind of
progress for all minorities
in the industry.

The true joy is in the
subtle details of a scene
and thematic bread-
crumbs scattered on the
ground for us to follow.
There is an enchanting
and heart-breaking scene
concerning Elizabeth
Moss’ doppelgänger char-
acter. The scene reveals so
much about the character
and plot, without the need
to explain it in dialogue;
Moss gives a terrific
performance. All the cast
display solid acting flair,

the star of the show; she
is incredible as Adelaide
and her double, Red. The

Thematically, Us plays
with recurring motifs of
mirrors and reflections,
rabbits and Michael Jack-
son’s ‘Thriller’. The film
doesn’t quite pull off the
overall cohesiveness of
its themes with the plot;
the sense of wholeness
and completeness that Get
Out had was lacking as
some elements of the film
felt forced together like
mismatching pieces of a
jigsawpuzzle.Thereisstill
a lot to unpack from Us.
I guess the film could be
intentionally ambiguous
in its purpose and, to the
film’s credit, this allows
for audiences to be able to
discuss and theorise about
the world of the film. My
initial reading of the film
was that it is about the
disillusioned underclass
of society. Although Peele
emphasises that the film is
about America, you could
draw parallels to our side
of the pond too. It could
also be about mental
health, guilt, the class
divide or immigration,
“Us is not a
film about
race”
There has always been
an imbalance of interest-
ing and complex leading
roles offered to white and
black actors in Holly-
wood. The initial reaction

movies, hits home this
ethos. He says “it’s not
because I don’t like white
dudes. It’s because I’ve
seen that movie.” Peele is
supporting the change in
the industry for diversity
— the point is not that he
won’t cast a white actor
for the main role, but
that as a black American
writer/director, he is
giving important opportu-
nities for black American
actors. Just as Scorsese
is the ultimate voice of
the flawed white male
lead character so revered
in American cinema,
Jordan Peele could have
as big a cultural impact,
leading the pack of a new
generation of filmmakers.
Us is an exemplar movie
that can be categorised
under this second phase
of black American films,
with the emphasis not on
‘black’ but on ‘American’
and ‘family’. It’s a small
step, but an important one,
and I am excited to see
what comes next of this
paradigm shift.
It’s not perfect, but

don’t go looking for too
much, as it ventures into
preposterous territory and

Nonetheless, there is no
doubt that a lot of metic-
ulous work has gone into
making Us, that makes it
so rewarding to watch and
talk about. Get Out was
no fluke. Peele has confi-
dently announced himself
as the fresh and exciting
voice of American
cinema.
