Triathlon does Duathlon
Another weekend,
another duathlon for
IC Triathlon. This time
we ventured outside of
London to the Bedford
Autodrome; a racing
circuit for cars built on an
old airfield. The Bedford
Autodrome duathlon
is a unique one in the
Triathlon race calendar,
as it is the only national
competition that we take
part of outside of the
university system. Forget
BUCS medals, placing
top 3 in your age-group
or finishing within 110%
of the winning time in
this duathlon qualifies
you automatically for the
GB Duathlon team and
secures you an entry at
the European Duathlon
Championships in 2020,
in other words, racing well
makes you a bigwig. With
a massive 400 entries, this
race was a big one.
There were two race
distances on offer: a
‘sprint’ and ‘standard’
duathlon. The sprint
duathlon was a 5km run,
20km bike which was
followed by another run
– mercifully only 2.5km.
I think it says something
about the sport when the
sprint event takes over
an hour to complete. The
standard distance is the
same format but double
the distance in every leg.
Arriving at the Auto-
drome we discovered that
there was wind. Lots of
wind, 40kph worth, to be
exact. This made the bike
section more ‘character
building’ than was initial-
ly anticipated.
Henry “I hate cycling”
Hart knew that the
running leg would be his
strongest, so made sure
to go out strong and hope
that he could hold on for
the cycle. With a blister-
ing fast off the bike run
he finished in 10th place
overall, and 3rd in his age
category. Matt Ryan, as
well as showing that he
could count laps this time,
also had the fastest tran-
sition time of the whole
competition in an incred-
ible 26 seconds. Matt
finished 12th overall and
4th in his age category.
Cedric Ormond flew by
on his new bike to finish
3rd in his age category.
Alex Mundell was 3rd
fastest in the first running
leg. Amy Davila was not
far behind with the 4th
fastest overall running
leg for both runs (before
and after the cycle). Big
respect is to be had for
Jacob Kay and Mari
Funabashi, who finished
despite not being at full
fitness.
Incredible success was
enjoyed by all, with many
top 3 age group finishes
and lots of potential quali-
fying times. We will have
to wait until after Summer
once all the qualification
races are out of the way
to see who qualified for
team GB. Stay tuned…
ICXCAC bring home second place from Poznań
I
mperial College
Cross Country and
Athletics team won a
superb silver trophy
at the Economic Five Race
in Poznań, Poland, on
Sunday 7th April, adding
to their 2019 collection of
successes.
On Friday 5th April,
12 of their finest runners
took an early plane to
Poznań, one of Poland’s
major cities. At the pub
in Stansted Airport, the
theme of the trip was set:
some running, a sprinkle
of sight-seeing, high class
meals in top restaurants
and of course, enjoying
local beverages!
After a two-hour flight,
the team arrived at its
five-star accommodation.
ICXC was kindly hosted
by the Uniwersytet Eko-
nomiczny w Poznaniu
(Poznań’s equivalent to
LSE) in their student
houses for three nights.
It was an honour to be
invited by the former
Polish Olympic Athlete,
Rafal Wieruszewski,
to take part in the 9th
edition of the Economic
Five Race organised by
the University of Poznań.
Upon arrival, bags were
quickly unpacked, and it
was time to explore!
All the Poznań rumours
are proven right: it is
a young and dynamic
city with a subtle mix of
Renaissance buildings,
Art Deco streets, and
Communist-era austere
infrastructure. Amazed
by the main square, Stary
Rynek, and its town hall,
the team practiced their
pronunciation of ‘Ile
kosztuje piwo?’ (‘piwo’
means ‘beer’), whilst
enjoying the spring sun
for the rest of the after-
noon. Their first dinner
was was a traste of rich
and appetizing traditional
Central European food, all
for the price of a sandwich
from the JCR! It was then
time to hit the Polish pubs
on an eventful night-out.
The next morning. for
the early birds amongst
them, the Citadel Park
provided a perfect spot
for a short jog and a yoga
session in the grass. The
awakened team then
went to the city centre
for breakfast, composed
of famous ‘Rogale Swi-
etomarcinskie’, or Saint
Martin croissant. The
cultural experience moved
from their mouths to their
ears as they attended a tra-
ditional dance and music
performance. Their ex-
ploration continued on the
Cathedral Island, which
saw the formation of the
Polish state. Next stop was
the hipster neighbourhood
of Srodka, on the other
side of the Warna River.
Another hearty dinner
around a massive wood
table welded the team
together before going to
bed for a nice long rest.
Sunday was race day
and everyone loaded
up with carbs from a
homecooked porridge.
The team arrived at Lake
Matla, along which the
5 km race was to take
place. They received their
racing packs containing
a towel and a beer. At 12
sharp, they and 800 other
runners from all around
Poland began a flat and
fast 5 km lap around the
lake. One mile before
the finish line, they were
all very pleased to see
their own photographer
Willy Bonneuil, who was
unfortunately injured and
not in the race, cheering
them on.
Matt Ryan led the
team with an amazing
pace, completing the race
in 17:47 and securing a
strong first place for an
International competitor.
Fresher Lea Adamson
brought back a 1st
place for Imperial in the
International Womens,
followed by Kay Raftery.
ICXCAC’s ladies all ran
great times with Marie
Jones, Maryna Voloshyna,
and Lisa Hey all scoring
personal bests.
The biggest moment of
glorycamewhenICXCAC
was announced, with a
strong Polish accent, to
be the second-best team
of the race. Matt Ryan,
Jim Warren, Aymeric
Regnier, Mihai Vanea,
Thomas Deronzier and
Lawrence Tse climbed on
the podium to raise high
their silver trophy! After
an extensive photoshoot,
the team headed to a quiet
restaurant for a traditional
post-race meal.
Their last evening in
Poland was devoted to
the celebration of their
morning successes.
Following a final king-
like dinner together,
the team took over the
‘beer and vodka’ bar for
an unexpected karaoke
night. Once given the
microphone, top hits from
socials back in London
were sung, giving Poznań
a taste of a night-out iat
The Slug! They chanted,
until the early hours of the
morning, songs in both
English and Polish to the
delight of all the pub.
Trophies survived the
night-out and were safely
packed to bring home.
At the end of the long
weekend, some members
had to fly back the next
morning, with revision
waiting for them back in
grey London. The others
enjoyed a nice relaxing
day in Poznań, making
the most of the sunny
Old Market Square, its
restaurants and bars, and
the Easter market before
saying their goodbyes
to their very welcoming
hosts.
