Awkward Conversations with Animals I’ve F*cked
T
here’s some-
thing to be said
about dating
animals. They’re
straightforward, relatively
predictable, and often
more empathic than
people. It’s probably why
Bobby, played by produc-
er Linus Karp, chose to
lose his virginity to a dog
he picked up on his way
home from a party. But
what possesses a man to
opt for bestiality over, say,
Tinder? That’s the ques-
tion posed by Rob Haye’s
Awkward Conversations
with Animals I’ve F*cked.
Over the course of an
hour and through five
conversations (I use the
term loosely due to a lack
of reply from his animal
counterparts), we see not
only Bobby’s growth from
an awkward first-timer to
a one-man animal-liber-
ator-and-romancer army,
but also the past that led
him to take this dark and
lonely path.
versations with his animal
companions, a move that
was initially jarring but
made sense, given the
delusional nature of his
personal reality. It even
underlies his actions and
behaviour when accessing
the stage. There’s none of
that pacing or ownership
that we typically see of a
one-man show, instead,
Bobby looks just as
uncomfortable and as out
of place in his own bed as
the woods he eventually
ends up in.
Karp does a wonderful
job of portraying Bobby as
an awkward, reclusive ad-
olescent. There’s initially
a wide-eyed innocence
and Michael Cera-esque
gawkiness to his conduct
that runs counter to
his bitter cynicism and
resentment he displays
while talking about his
human peers. It’s chilling,
the casual flip between
post-coital small talk and
the lashing out at society
as a whole and it is the
latter, darker aspect of his
personality that is given
the most space to grow
throughout the show.
Where Awkward Con-
versations runs a little flat
is its comedy, which I was
slightly disappointed by.
With a name like that, I
was expecting great things
but the humour, while
always a welcome relief
from such earnest subject
matters, is often a bit too
knowing for someone
who is so fully involved
with his own delusions.
It’s also not quite enough
to really lift the progres-
sively dark narrative
Bobby is led down.
Awkward Conversa-
tions with Animals I’ve
F*cked is a powerful and
unsettling exploration of
loneliness and how one
man tries to deal with his
isolation without a role
model or the support he
needed. In many ways,
it’s the origin story of
bullies, misogynists, and
incels, just with added
heavy petting.
Sex, Drugs, and Murder on the Heath
W
e meet
A n t h o n y
( C i a r á n
Owens), a
manjustshyofthirty-three
(as he fond of telling us)
at his arrival at a chemsex
party. He is a seasoned
pro, bantering with Ian
Hallard’s accountant who
is in charge of metering
out the GBL doses mixed
in with apple juice or
lucozade. Just when he is
about to chat up a potential
hook-up, Anthony’s night
is interrupted by the
ghost of George (Harry
Lister Smith), a past fling.
George, barely twenty
and was infatuated with
Anthony, has recently
died of a purported
overdose on Tumulus, a
hill on Hampstead Heath.
Only, there is more to his
death than the Ham&High
would care to report;
George reveals toAnthony
that he was murdered,
and implores his ex-lover
to find his killer. Thus
begins Anthony’s quest
through North London to
find a missing necklace
and justice for a man, for
whom, despite himself, he
was beginning to develop
feelings.
As Anthony meets
with exes, police officers,
potential love interests,
and Scottish aunts who
know more than they
seem, Hallard and Lister
Smith zoom around the
stage playing dozens of
roles each. They are also
the special effects crew:
as Anthony suffers with-
drawal symptoms and
crippling anxiety, Owens;
supporting castmates
create great clangings of
metal against metal by
banging scissor blades
together. When Anthony
stumbles through the
Heath, pursued by an
assailant, Hallard sprays
smoke at his feet. In the
intimate Soho Theatre,
where the audience sits
mere inches from the
action, this staging feels
electrifyingly visceral.
Christopher Adams’s
script is arch; taking par-
ticular aim at the hypoc-
risies of well-to-do of the
North London gay society.
At a birthday gathering
that Anthony attends at
his ex-boyfriend’s house,
the well-heeled guests
take swipes at each other
over painfully mid-
dle-class food (“lozenges
of champagne jelly”
feature). For all the play’s
fizzing humour, Adams
has much to say about the
darker aspects of these
men’s lives. None of his
characters are happy, all
are seeking intimacy with
other men in ways that
don’t involve drugs and
sex, yet none can really
get there, all live in world
where no one really cares
about boys dying alone in
the middle of the night in
a London park. Even for a
self proclaimed noir, it is
unusually bleak.
Tumulus’ grittiness
makes for an engaging
thriller, but it is also its
undoing. This is a play
almost entirely devoid
of tenderness; while it’s
one-liners were barbed
enough to deliver laughs
and polished performanc-
es from all three of its
actors, I was never fully
able to fully emotionally
invest in any of the char-
acters. With an ending
that is mechanical in tying
up the mystery but does
little to provide character
growth or any redemptive
arc. The darkness in
which Tumulus revels,
feels less hard-hitting
than more and more
banal with every snarky,
unhappy line.

Tumulus is a chem-sex “queer noir” that falls short
“In the

adolescent”
This loneliness, the
desperate need to fill a
void with companionship,
permeates every scene
and is the main focus of
the play. This is evident
in the set of his tiny,
hoarder’s burrow of a
bedroom that we, the
audience, are invited to
view from uncomfortably
small distance. It accents
the rambling monologue
nature of Bobby’s con-
