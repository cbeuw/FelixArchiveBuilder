Seeing the light: Acting against actinic keratosis
E
aster weekend
this year saw
most of us out
enjoying the
sunshine, after digging
through our cupboards to
bring out our sunhats, sun-
dresses, sunglasses and
sun cream. While the first
hot days of the year are
always greatly appreciat-
ed, sun exposure can lead
to several problems, both
in the UK and particularly
in hotter countries such as
Australia – one of which
is actinic keratosis.
Actinic keratoses are
scaly, rough growths
on the skin, which are
mostly harmless – but
they do have the poten-
tial to develop into skin
cancer. They are caused
by damage to the skin by
UV radiation. Actinic ker-
atoses can be surgically
removed, or treated with
creams, and a therapy
that is becoming more
commonplace is photody-
namic therapy (PDT).
PDT is where a
light-sensitive chemical,
called a photosensitiser, is
applied to the affected skin
area. This is then activated
by light to create reactive
oxygen species within
the damaged or abnormal
skin cells, thereby killing
them. Conventionally,
PDT involves activation
of the chemical using ir-
radiation from a red lamp,
but for people with large
areas of affected skin,
this can be quite uncom-
fortable. Another form of
PDT involves activation
by natural daylight. This
treatment works just as
well as conventional PDT,
and may also save on
resources associated with
maintaining and calibrat-
ing artificial light sources.
As the warm weather
approaches and we start
to anticipate our nice
tans and holidays to
hotter climates, it’s worth
bearing in mind the darker
side of the sun - and the
risks of UV exposure.
