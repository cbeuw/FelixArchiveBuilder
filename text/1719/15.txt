Becoming: An Intimate Conversation with Michelle
Obama

brought the
E u r o p e a n
leg of her book tour for
her memoir, Becoming,
to London on 14th
April
in emphatic fashion.
Stepping out at London’s
O2 arena to Alicia Keys’
‘Girl on Fire’, the former
US First Lady was met
with rapturous applause
and a standing ovation
from a 15,000-stong
audience of mostly
women (unsurprisingly,
there were very few
men in attendance and
even fewer white men).
Having already failed
to obtain tickets for her
last visit to London, a
somewhat impromptu
December 2018 visit to
the Southbank Centre,
which sold out in
minutes following the
book’s November 2018
release, I was just grate-
ful to finally be in the
same building as Mrs.
Obama. I was certainly
not alone in my excite-
ment and the audience’s
collective enthusiasm
was palpable as we hung
on to her every word,
listening to Michelle
reflect on her life as
decribed in Becoming.
In the wide-ranging
interview, chaired by
US late-night television
host, Stephen Colbert,
who did a good job of
injecting humour and
bringing necessary
levity to proceedings,
Michelle delved into all
aspects of her life. Much
like in the memoir, we
are taken on a journey,
from Michelle Robinson
- the girl from a work-
ing-class family growing
up on the south side of
Chicago - to Michelle
Obama - mother, philan-
thropist and First Lady,
and all the trials and
tribulations faced on the
way.
For the memoir of
a former White House
resident, Becoming is
surprisingly apolitical.
Michelle Obama’s
aversion to politics is
apparent throughout the
book - it’s not something
she enjoys, more some-
thing that was thrust
upon her. Although the
conversation rarely
strayed into political
territory, when asked for
her views on the current
US political climate,
Michelle said: “It’s time
for us to roll up our
sleeves and, if we are not
happy with the state of
things then, in democra-
cies, we have votes. We
have to be engaged and
we can’t take our rights
and liberties for granted
because, if we don’t
vote, somebody else
will.” This was a rather
simplistic view that
doesn’t tackle a host of
political issues, includ-
ing, for instance, when
voters don’t feel repre-
sented by the policies
of the options at hand.
However, Becoming,
and this event, are about
much more than politics.
I urge readers to put their
political views on the
Obama administration
aside as there is some-
thing to be learned and
inspiration to be gleaned
from Michelle Obama’s
story of motherhood and
family.
Becoming is divided
into sections, my
favourite of which is
“Becoming Us”, where
Michelle dives into her
relationship with Barack
Obama - them meeting,
eventually falling in
love and how their re-
lationship has evolved.
The way she speaks so
glowingly about Barack
and the peace he brings
her is wonderful and you
can’t help but admire
how pure their love is.
Black love at its finest
- it’s a beautiful thing!
J. Cole should change
the lyrics to his 2014
hit ‘No Role Modelz’
from, “I want a real
love... that Jada and that
Will love” to “I want a
real love... that Barack
and Michelle love”. All

jokes aside, it is refresh-
ing to see the human
aspect of a couple that
has dominated political
conversation for the last
decade.
I also particularly
enjoyed the sections
in which she described
coping with the loss of
her father and I would
recommend those
chapters for anybody
struggling with bereave-
ment. It’s comforting to
know that. somewhere
out there, somebody
else is going through
something similar and
feeling what you’re
feeling. Obama ad-
dressed the crowd’s
reception, saying: “I
think it’s a testament to
how much we all have
in common around the
world. The fact that
people are finding them-
selves in the story of
this little girl, Michelle
Robinson, on the south
side of Chicago is not a
testament to me and my
story, but it’s a reminder
that we’re OK, folks.
We’re going to be OK.”
With this, Michelle
perfectly captured the
beauty of Becoming. I
initially had my reser-
vations about reading
a memoir because I
wasn’t convinced any-
body’s life is honestly
interesting enough for
me to devote time to
reading about. The only
(auto-)biography I’ve
ever enjoyed is Sir Alex
Ferguson’s (I’m yet to
read Malcom X’s but it’s
next on my reading list)
and that’s definitely got
something to do with my
Manchester United-bias.
However, Becoming
proved me wrong with
its honesty and moments
of vulnerability which
are relatable for all
readers.
