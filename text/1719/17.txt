My Supervision Story
POSTGRADUATE
Ute Thiermann
GSU President
M
y objective
to improve
supervision
at Imperial
College has turned out
to be a real conundrum.
I hear endless stories of
PG research students
being unhappy with their
level of supervision, the
behaviour of their super-
visors and precarious lab
situations. Being aware
of the sensitivity of these
stories, I believed that
by creating a channel
for students to share
their supervision stories
anonymously in Felix, we
could glance behind the
scenes and understand the
reality of supervision at
the College. By sharing
positive as well as neg-
ative experiences with
supervision, I hoped that
we could create an insti-
tutional discussion around
the quality of supervision
and the success of College
procedures in dealing
with failing relationships.
One major problem with
supervision is its huge
variety in quality, rang-
ing from students at the
College feeling very sup-
ported to those suffering
daily and turning into case
numbers and waiting lists
at the College Counselling
service.
Over the course of four
months, I have hardly
received any supervision
stories, which shows that
something about this
equation just doesn’t add
up. Why do students talk
about, but do not want
to share their stories? Is
it that everyone is just
too busy to sit down for
20 minutes to write and
share? Is it that people
think their story is not
worth sharing? Or are
students afraid of being
identified, even as anony-
mous writers, threatening
the future of their relation-
ship with their supervisors
and the outcome of their
PhD? Frankly, I have no
clue, and probably, it is a
mixed bag of reasons.
Having promised that I
would work on this topic,
I use any opportunity to
raise awareness about
the student-supervisor
relationship and its link
to PG well-being (which
was proven in the 2017/18
HEFCE well-being
report). My main concern
is that students actually
do have many ways to
improve their supervision,
but they still seem to feel
powerless and scared. Just
to mention a few mecha-
nisms: on the local level,
students can speak to
their PG Tutors as well as
raise a complaint within
their Departments. If this
seems too immediate,
students can speak to the
PG Senior Tutor at their
Faculty. Final instance
is to raise a formal
complaint, following the
academic complaints
regulation (to find on the
Imperial College Website,
pathway: Home – About
– Governance - Academic
governance - Academic
policy - Complaints,
appeals and discipline).
Complaints can be
handled at three levels,
from local to College,
and there are several
methods of intervention
and monitoring for dif-
ficult student-supervisor
relationships.
I started wondering. Do
students use the formal
complaint’s procedure?
Or does either the lack of
knowledge about these
procedures, or fear, keep
students from using this
process? Is the complaints
procedure fit-for-purpose
to encourage PG students
to reach out? To find out
more and discuss this
question at the Postgrad-
uate Research Quality
Committee, I filed a
Freedom of Information
Request to the complaints
team of the College. I
received the following
response with data from
the last 5 years:
• 72% of all academic
complaints were
raised by PG
students, which is
reflected in 26 formal
complaints.
• Of those, 11 were
related to supervisors
while the others
referred to issues with
the programme man-
agement, resource
allocation, service
provision and others.
• Typical outcomes
of these complaints
have been the partial
refunding of fees,
compensation, or
additional time
granted to the student
to complete their
programme of study.
Pretty good, isn’t it?
But wait… 11 complaints
in 5 years? The data
provided by the College
only referred to the Level
3 complaints. But before
complaints reach level
3, many complaints get
resolved at levels 1 and 2.
Unfortunately, the com-
plaints team was unable to
hand out information on
the numbers of complaints
for levels 1 and 2, using
the disclosure exemption
rule under section 12 (1)
of the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act. Apparently,
it would take them more
than 18 hours to put that
data together, as they
claimed they would have
to email all teaching staff
at the College and ask
them which complaints
had been filed against
them. After reading the
complaints regulation, I
reckoned, this can hardly
be true. Responses to
Level 1 complaints must
be recorded through
the email student.com-
plaints@imperial.ac.uk.
Level 2 complaints must
be submitted via a formal
Student Complaint Sub-
mission Form. I raised
these reservations with
the College and requested
another round of informa-
tion. The outcome is that
for years, the College has
not collected any central-
ised information on Level
1 and 2 complaints. Only
in 2018, the complaints
procedure was changed
so that now, departments
have to inform the com-
plaints team about what
is happening under their
administration.
While it is utterly sad
that a university of ‘ex-
cellence’, which Imperial
College claims to be, has
refrained from monitoring
their complaints for so
many years, it is also a
sign of progress. Since
I started my presidency,
I sense a certain wind of
change blowing around
the College corridors.
There is a growing
understanding that the
experience of PG students
needs to be taken serious-
ly, and that the College
must maintain an eye on
the work of supervisors.
I hope that future GSU
presidents will uphold the
pressure on the College
so that supervisors with
repetitive complaints can
be stopped from taking
on more students. What
does this mean for PG
students? It is important
that you make yourself
visible if you are suffering
because only through
taking advantage of the
mechanisms in place,
can we change the way
in which the College is
run. You are not alone, so
don’t be afraid to claim
your rights.
I
often find myself
faced with questions
from friends and
colleagues such as
“What is it like to be a gay
man at uni?” or “How do
others perceive you once
they find out that you are
gay?”. I used to ask the
same questions during
my undergraduate studies
at UCL, prior to starting
my MRes+PhD course in
Chemical Biology in the
Department of Chemistry
here at Imperial. I won-
dered whether I would
be accepted by my future
colleagues in research and
by my supervisors. I was
constantly thinking about
the potentially negative
impact revealing my sex-
uality could have on my
research and future career
prospects. I anxiously
asked myself “Is it worth
keeping your sexuality
a secret?”. Having been
here for a year and half
now, I am glad to say that
the answer to this question
is a resounding “NO!”.
After coming to
Imperial, I was elated
to find that the LGBT+
community is well repre-
sented all around college.
Support groups such as
IQ and Imperial 600 do
a great deal of work by
organising seminars,
campaigns and events
to raise the visibility of
the LGBT+ community
around college and
create a more welcoming
environment. One of the
campaigns organised by
Imperial 600 that I abso-
lutely love is the distribu-
tion of Imperial College
London branded rainbow
lanyards to their members,
which is a fantastic way

W
here I’m
from, the
colour of
my skin
didn’t make me “the
minority”, nor did being a
female determine my aca-
demic success. Where I’m
from, it was quite com-
monly joked about that
the girls were smarter and
more mature than the boys
because, after all, “behind
every successful man is a
strong woman who helped
him get there”. So, from
an early age, I never once
thought that my gender
would determine my
progression.
That quickly changed
on arrival to University.As
excited and starry-eyed as
I was, I didn’t quite know
what I expected but, to be
the ONLY black person
in all of my programmes
at the University was not
what I had in mind. What
a way to stand out…as if
being one of five females
in an engineering Master’s
wasn’t enough, the colour
of my skin made me stand
out even more, and si-
multaneously put a target
on my back. As black
women, we are easily
identified when we make
mistakes but seldom rec-
ognised for achievements.
We are boxed in by stere-
otypes which narrate that
wearing specific garments
or accessories were
deemed as distracting
rather than fashionable.
So, to avoid drawing even
more attention to myself,
I tried to dim down that
AGSUPresidenttearingherhairoutoveranambitiousprojectandhowshefiledaFreedomofInformationrequest
to the College
Dimming down my blackness
stereotypical “black girl”
image in hopes that the
hoops or head wraps
wouldn’t distract from my
intelligence. I guess I did
pretty well as I have even
been told “you’re quite
soft spoken for a black
girl”.
At a point in my pro-
gramme, I was amazed
by how much my female
classmate admired and
looked up to our female
lecturer. However, there
was no one I could relate
to as all my lecturers were
mostly male and I didn’t
expect the only female
lecturer to understand
what it was like to be a
black woman in STEM.
The feeling of isolation
and being misunderstood
through the lack of rep-
resentation was, and con-
tinues to be, a struggle. As
a black girl in STEM, it
became clear that we often
have to forge our own
paths and strive to be that
example and mentor for
future generations. I later
realised, it was not the
failures that were going to
define me or us minority
females but, rather, the re-
silience in getting back up
and fighting through these
challenges that makes
me and other women of
colour stronger.
But you see, the
challenge never ends,
never really ends. With
the rise of diversity and
inclusivity, we now check
the boxes of many organ-
isations:
Black; Female…but
this only gets me in the
door. I have to work even
harder to show my ability
as there is a probability
that I was just selected to
help boost their diversity
score. Sadly, this reality
is often expressed by
bitter male colleagues
who think they deserved
your spot. But please
don’t let my shyness or
“quiet black-girl” nature
fool you because, through
my heritage, I have been
raised strong and resilient.
I know my worth and my
lack of entitlement has
taught me how to be a part
of a community and blend
across gender, race, sexu-
ality to get the job done.
So, although we
struggle to be represented,
I’ll say thank you because
it only makes us stronger.
We work harder, we work
smarter and are more
committed than ever. So,
now I wear my hoops
and headscarves with
pride because IT’S TIME
THAT WE STAND OUT
AND BE RECOGNISED
FOR THE WORK THAT
IS TRULY OURS AND
GIVE YOUNG GIRLS
SOMEONE TO LOOK
UP TO WITH PRIDE.

to raise the visibility of
the LGBT+ community
at Imperial and you get a
strange sense of comfort
when you see one of the
colourful lanyards coming
towards you! Imperial also
observes LGBT history
month which provides a
great opportunity to find
out more about LGBT+
history and the LGBT+
community outside of
college.
I am often asked about
how my supervisors
perceive me after finding
outaboutmysexuality,and
if their attitude changed
after learning about it.
While this is something
I have not explicitly
discussed with them, it
has been rather like an
open secret all along, and
I never felt in any way
discriminated against by
them or members of my
research groups. I have
always felt that as long
as your science is good,
people will judge you on
the merits of your work
and not because of your
sexuality, and I find that
this is very much the case
here at Imperial.
As for future career
prospects, it has been very
reassuring to see so many
openly LGBT+ members
of staff turning up to the
Imperial 600 meetings.
In academia at least, my
view is that being gay
does not play a role in
determining whether you
are successful or not, it is
all about one’s own ideas,
personality and deter-
mination. Tom Welton’s
truly inspiring ascent, the
first openly gay academic
to hold the position ‘Dean
of the Faculty of Natural
Sciences’ at Imperial, is
the ultimate proof. During
my MRes year, I had
the opportunity to visit
several chemical/phar-
maceutical companies in
industry. I was pleasantly
surprised to see many of
them discussing the steps
they were taking against
discrimination of LGBT+
people in the workplace
and what they were doing
to promote inclusivity and
acceptance among their
employees.
I feel very lucky to
be where I am, and I am
highly appreciative of
the support that I have
received from many
people around Imperial,
both staff and students,
postgraduates and under-
graduates. For many of
us in the LGBT+ com-
munity, finding yourself
and accepting yourself for
the person you really are
can be a long and scary
journey, and I am glad
that Imperial, through its
policies, societies and
volunteer-led networks is
reaching out to LGBT+
people more than ever
before.
This is just one per-
spective of a postgrad-
uate gay man from the
Department of Chemistry
and perhaps isn’t repre-
sentative of everyone in
the LGBT+ community
here at Imperial – LGBT
people are truly as diverse
as the colour spectrum of
the rainbow and while my
experiences as a gay man
have been overwhelm-
ingly positive, others
may have a completely
different story to tell. I
hope that more and more
students representing dif-
ferent parts of the LGBT+
community are willing
to share their stories as
this allows us to gauge
whether we are moving
in the right direction and
informs us what we can
do to change things for the
better, for everyone!

comfort when you see one
