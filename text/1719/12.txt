Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event
T
he evening
c o m m e n c e d
on what would
have been the
100th birthday of
Merce Cunningham,
the renowned American
choreographer widely
considered to be the father
of postmodern dance.
Coordinated by the Merce
Cunningham Trust and
maintaining the authentic
Cunningham style, it was
an ambitious undertaking
with performances across
three cities on the same
day.
The 25 soloists, pulled
from several companies
– The Royal Ballet, Bal-
letBoyz and Rambert to
name a few – all rehearsed
with the Cunningham
technique. That is to say,
they learnt the moves in
isolation from the music;
Cunningham believed
dance is an artform which
does not need to follow
an individual beat. This
created an excited tension
in the audience, as we
knew the dancers would
first hear the live music at
the same time as we did,
enabling some spontane-
ous creative interpretation
from them.
The music was co-
ordinated by Christian
Wolff and directed by
John King. The five
musicians presented a
modern soundscape, with
discordant and jarring
noises peppered with the
occasional silence. The
beauty of Cunningham’s
style is that the rhythmic
movement of the dancers,
the slamming of feet and
landing of jumps, also
becomes a part of the
musical underscore.
were intricate, at times
true solos and in other
moments interwoven
with others. These were
taken from 54 original
Cunningham choreogra-
phies from 1953-2009.
The fantastic staging led
by Daniel Squire gave a
fresh take on these pieces.
As the iconic colourful
Lycra bodysuits flashed
against the dark stage, it
was wonderful to see the
solos performed by such
a wide range of ages and
body types.
One of the highlights of
the night was seeing Billy
Trevitt dancing in a body
harness with tin cans,
creating music through his
movement. Or perhaps,
in an earlier solo, with
Trevitt demonstrating
precise deep lunges, and
holding firm one of these
lunges as he was lifted
across the stage. Siobhan
Davies was another
show-stealer with her
precise, measured move-
ments across the stage.
Other artists stood out as
well. Francesca Hayward
frequently caught your
eye with the way she
carried feeling through
her movements, elon-
gating her deep plié with
meaning. Joseph Sissens
demonstrated impressive
extensions and refined
technique. And the grunts
emanating from Jonathan
Goddard as he swayed his
hips were hard to miss.
movements, punctuated
by staccato leaps and im-
pressive lunges. Cunning-
ham’s work is so uniquely
physical, it truly shows
off dancers as the athletes
they are.
While the solos were
squeezed into a long
90 minutes without an
interval, had it been 10
minutes shorter it would
have left the audience
wanting more. There
was a notable amount
of restless stirring in
the seats for these last
minutes. Understandable,
as the harsh nature of
Cunningham’s technique
does not make easy
watching. Nonetheless, it
was a wonderful unique
evening representing the
best of Cunningham.
An intriguing evening celebrating Merce Cunningham and his unique methodology, blending one hundred solos
from across his work.

As typical of Cun-

behind the dancers were

She Persisted Don McCullin
F
ollowing the
acclaimed She
Said in 2016,
English National
Ballet’s director Tamara
Rojo continues with She
Persisted, another triple
bill showcasing women’s
work offering a revival,
a premiere and one of the
greats. The name comes
from the feminist move-
ment “Nevertheless, she
persisted” in 2017 after
the silencing of Senator
Elizabeth Warren in the
US Senate. The reference
to women’s persistence in
breaking barriers, despite
the hardships thrown at
them, is especially signifi-
cant here.
In Annabelle Lopez
Ochoa’s Broken Wings,
a revival from She Said,
Katja Khaniukova is a
spirited Frida Kahlo, a
role originally created on
Tamara Rojo, with Irek
Mukhamedov reprising as
her womanising husband,
Diego Rivera. The re-
al-life comparisons of his
elephant to her dove are
apparent, as is the subtext
of the Day-of-the-Dead-
esque skeletons haunting
Frida’s every move. The
memorable monologue on
pain from BBC’s Fleabag
comes to mind: “Women
are born with pain built
in… We carry it within
ourselves throughout our
lives. Men don’t. They
have to seek it out.”
Stina Quagebeur’s
world premiere of Nora,
a stripped back adapta-
tion of A Doll’s House,
is her first major work
for the company. The
eight-person piece set
to Philip Glass’ Tirol
Concerto for Piano and
Orchestra was scaled
back, focusing on the
relationship of Nora and
Torvald (beautifully per-
formed by Crystal Costa
and Jeffrey Cirio), with
the blackmailer Krogstad
and five “voices” clad in
grey silk acting as Nora’s
conscience, personifying
her internal struggle and
her growing self-worth
and resolve. The series of
duets go from light and
whimsical to increasingly
controlling and dominat-
ing, even resorting to a
repeating sit-on-my-knee
do-as-I-do motif. Jeffrey
Cirio delights in some
of Quagebeur’s best
choreography, complete
with outstanding leaps
and changes of pace from
devastation and anger to
softly manipulative. In the
final desperately beautiful
pas de deux between the
two, where she decides
to leave him, you can
almost hear her narration:
“I have another duty, just
as sacred. My duty to
myself”.
Pina Bausch’s 1975
Rite of Spring does not
start when the dancers
come onto the stage,
rather in the laying of the
dirt that the dancers will
soon throw themselves
into. Bausch passed away
in 2009 but left a huge
legacy in one of the most
riveting and visceral in-
terpretations of a master-
piece. Stravinsky’s iconic
score and the otherness
of both groups, all so
young and so unlike the
ancient casts in other in-
terpretations. The ethereal
quality of the women in
their long flowing gowns
and the raw masculinity
in the bare-chested men
only adds to the strangely
hypnotic atmosphere,
as if we along with the
dancers are possessed
by some overwhelming
destructive force. Pausch
always wanted to capture
the mind, body and soul of
her dancers and in Franc-
esca Velicu, who reprises
her Olivier-winning role
as the Chosen One, she
certainly has. In the final
shattering solo, she loses
herself in battling against
her fate and so do we,
haunted by the unforgiv-
ing strings, her wild eyes
and the terribly beautiful
inevitability of it all.
D
on McCullin is
best known as a
‘war photogra-
pher’, a title
that does not sit easy with
him. To him, photography
is about empathy, but
he has never felt that the
impact of his pictures
have done enough to end
the suffering of the people
he depicts. ‘If you can’t
feel what you’re looking
at,’ he said, ‘then you’re
never going to get others
to feel anything when they
look at your pictures.’
In the largest retro-
spective exhibition of
his works to date, this
empathy McCullin speaks
of penetrates each and
every one of his photo-
graphs. Unusually for
an exhibition of contem-
porary photography, he
has printed every work
himself. Although his
repeated return to these
pictures of suffering has
taken its toll, perhaps
printing his pictures
personally completes the
process of embodying
empathy for his subjects.
Beginning with pictures
of his community around
Finsbury Park in London,
where he grew up, this ex-
hibition at the Tate Britain
traces McCullin’s career
across various assign-
ments in different parts of
the world in turmoil, in-
terspersed with stints back
home. What ties these
photographs together is
McCullin’s eye for human
emotion, and a sensitivity
towards the people living
on the outskirts of society.
Even from his early
works photographing
gangs in north London,
his photographs were
intuitive, full of curios-
ity and empathy for his
subjects. These photo-
graphs were picked up by
the press, earning him his
first contract. From there,
he travelled to Berlin to
document the building
of the Berlin wall. In
images of East Germans
looking into West Berlin,
he captures the curiosity,
trepidation and uncer-
tainty of the faces of the
East Germans emerging
from behind the half-built
wall; in West Berliners
looking East, women clad
in thick coats look with
concern into the distance,
and a child looks through
binoculars. These are the
faces of people witnessing
history, uncertain about
the impact this wall will
bring to their lives.
The impact of his
photographs are perhaps
best remembered by
his photographs of the
Vietnam War, in particular
those taken in 1968 when
he spent eleven days
with American troops.
His images depicting the
impact of the war on the
young American troops,
many of whom are inex-
perienced, contributed
to the negative public
impression of the war
back in the US, and the
increasing pressure to end
it. His picture of “Shell-
Shocked US Marine”
depicts the blank face
of a marine staring into
the distance, clutching
his rifle, traumatized by
the Battle of Hue, one of
the longest and bloodiest
battles of the war.
During his stints back
in England, McCullin con-
tinued to show an interest
in documenting the
margins of society, of the
suffering in his backyard.
Between the 1960s to the
1980s, he photographed
men and women living on
the streets of Aldgate and
Whitechapel, in images
entirely unrecognizable
today, following extensive
gentrification of the area.
He befriended many of the
subjects he photographed,
and painted intimate por-
traits of those who were
left behind as the wealthy
financial centre next
door continued to surge
forward.
This is an excellent
exhibition that takes
the viewer through Don
McCullin’s varied career,
on the way serving as a
tour of modern history.
These photographs are
intimate, sensitive works
that provide a window to
immense suffering, seen
through McCullin’s un-
flinching, empathetic eye.
