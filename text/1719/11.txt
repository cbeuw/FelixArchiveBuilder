F
or any hectic
Londoner, and
especially the
sleep-deprived
Imperial student, coffee is
a staple - if not a necessity
- of daily existence. Now
in its 9th year running, the
London Coffee Festival
is a massive celebration
of everyone’s favourite
stimulant. And when I say
massive, I mean massive.
With four floors and over
250 stands, there’s enough
coffee packed into one
space to make a herd of
elephants jittery.
The amazing thing
about the festival is how
it covers every step of
coffee consumption. First
the beans, of course.
An immense range of
single origin beans from
Ethiopia to Indonesia,
lovingly prepared by
roasteries from Cornwall
to Birmingham. And
then the machines. The
latest and greatest in cof-
fee-making technology is
on display here.
Traditional brands like
Chemex to Hario. Won-
derful new gadgets like
a liquid nitrogen aeration
device from Austria.
Want milk in your
coffee? Not a problem.
There’s specialty dairy
milk from farms like
Brades Farm, expressly
formulated for the most
silky texture. Or if you
want to go dairy-free,
there’s a whole plethora
of options. Soy, almond,
lactose-free, even maca-
damia - the possibilities
are endless!
It’s great. Maybe it’s
“Enough
coffee... to
make a herd
of elephants
jittery”
masterclass on the use
of nitro cold brew (that’s
nitrogenated cold brew,
which comes ‘on tap’ and
looks much like a nice
stout) in cocktails - the
cold brew mojito is amaz-
ingly smooth. A subtle
kick from the coffee and
the acidity pairs nicely
with the lime juice.
The London Coffee
Festival is clearly a place
for industry / coffee-shop
owners to find their feet -
we even pass an interior
design stall specialising
in the light wood, ex-
posed-filament lightbulb
coffeeshop vibe - but for
the amateur coffee enthu-
siast it’s a fantastic peek
into the world of profes-
sional coffee brewery. I
have an intense discussion
with a barista about the
lightness of “3rd wave
coffee” versus traditional
roasts which apparently
have “more crema,
slight bitterness and less
acidity”. Another waxes
lyrical about the benefits
of an machine with double
boilers - one for espresso
extraction and a separate
one for milk foaming,
so you have “precise
control over the milk
temperature”. Chatting to
the baristas and roastery
owners, it’s so inspiring
to see their passion for
our humble caffeinated
beverage. Who knew so
much thought and effort
could go into a simple cup
of coffee? - Claire Chan
through purchasing cof-
fee-related art. Admirably,
50% of all ticket sales
to The London Coffee
Festival and sales of
art go towards Project
Waterfall, the charitable
component of UK Coffee
Week that aims to deliver
safe drinking water and
sanitation projects for up
to 100,000 people, specif-
ically in coffee-producing
countries in Africa. There
was art made using
coffee, art focussing on
the importance of coffee
in getting us through the
day (no one can contest
that). There were also
some very trippy ones
that mimicked the effect
of a brain saturated with
caffeine – which, I can
assure you, was rather ef-
fective: it made you doubt
whether the painting was
mimicking double vision,
or whether it was the
effect of caffeine on my
rather addled brain.
One of the highlights
of the festival must be
the famed Coffee Masters
competition. With the
16 best baristas from
around Europe pitched
against each other in 8
disciplines, the knockout
competition is judged
by a panel of industry
figureheads with a £5000
prize and the prestigious
title of Coffee Master at
stake. The first round was
‘The Cupping’ – where
competitors had to guess
the single origin of 6 dif-
ferent cups of coffee. And
who knew coffee tasting
could be so intense – each
competition took a tiny sip
out of a spoon, swirled it
around in their mouth, and
promptly spat it out into a
bucket. As much as I love
coffee, I doubt I could
tell you the difference
between a Guatemalan
and a Costa Rican roast,
or one from Myanmar vs.
Brunei. Secondly, a wheel
was spun to determine the
method of brewing coffee.
The contestants then
had to select ‘the right
coffee’ to suit the brewing
method, and be quizzed
intensely by the judges
as to the reasons behind
their choices and type of
flavour profile they were
aiming for. The Latte Art
discipline then pitched the
competitors against each
other on visual appearance
of the pattern, milk quality
and contrast – which I had
never considered before.
The experience and
excitement of watching
world-class baristas go
head-to-head in mastering
the subtle and complex
art of perfecting that brew
was a memorable one
indeed.
Through wandering the
stalls and conversing with
baristas and stall-owners,
there were a few stalls
that imparted some words
of wisdom to us. The
owner of ‘Ngopi coffee’
enthusiastically told us
about how coffee beans
are not intrinsically ‘good’
or ‘bad’ based on their
country of origin, with
variation even within indi-
vidual farms. Instead, the
type of roast and brewing
method has a large impact
on the flavour profile. We
also learned from a café
and school in Shoreditch
that their name ‘7 Grams’
is the perfect weight of
beans used in an espresso.
Whilst sampling a de-
lightful and rich espresso
from them, we found out
that the process of coffee
making goes through at
least 40 people before
reaching us - farmers,
quality control, grinders,
baristas and many more.
Finally, ‘Curtis coffee’
had a unique concept
of simplifying the types
of coffee into different
types – sweet, bright, and
complex. Their owner,
with 7 years of experience
under her belt, will then
find the best single origin
beans to match the flavour
profile, and we are con-
sumers trust her palate to
find and roast that perfect
coffee.
Overall, the Coffee
Festival was a friendly,
buzzing and caffeine-lad-
en experience that I
would love to revisit. It
also opened up a new
world of coffee-making
to us: it showed us the
lengths which baristas go
to hone their craft, and
the passion they have for
creating that perfect cup.
So many different aspects
are involved, from con-
siderations about brewing
method, milk and water
temperature, grind of the
bean, weight of the coffee,
length of time brewing
and even the types of
water used. Mastering that
perfect balance of bitter-
ness, body, sweetness and
flavour notes is something
each coffee connoisseur
aspires to achieve, and the
complexity of good cof-
fee-making is something
I have a newfound ap-
preciation for. - Elizabeth

V
essel traverses
a very fine line
between “what
the hell am I
watching?” and “I can’t
stop watching”. Eerie
music and near humanly
impossible contortions
of the human body make
this both the weirdest and
most captivating thing
I’ve ever witnessed on
stage – I simply couldn’t
take my eyes off it.
This collaboration
between French-Belgian
choreographer Damien
Jalet and Japanese
sculptor Kohei Nawais
was a truly unique work
of art, visually striking
with masterful technique.
I don’t know anything
about dance, but I can
tell you that some of the
positions that the seven
dancers got themselves
into seemed superhuman.
As they tangled with
one another, sometimes
you couldn’t see where
one body started and the
other ended. The physical
endurance it must have
taken to maintain the
‘headlessness’ for a whole
hour – that is, their arms
always concealing their
entire heads – seemed like
it must have been incred-
ibly painful to do whilst
simultaneously intertwin-
ing and undulating their
bodies. I was in absolute
awe of their physical
control and skill. The lack
of identity, along with the
nakedness (save for a pair
of flesh-coloured shorts),
gave the impression of
what counts as human and
what doesn’t.
It starts with the whole
stage covered in water;
our eyes trick us as we
see both the dancers and
their reflections. By the
end, foam is being used as
the main prop as the few
remaining dancers cover
themselves in it. It sounds
weird thinking about
it now, but at the time
it seemed like it made
perfect sense considering
what I had been watching
for the last 45 minutes.
The whole production
was like something set in
outer space.
To be honest, I could
see why this wouldn’t be
for everyone. It’s a full
hour of strange living art
unfolding in front of your
very eyes, but visually
it was so mesmerising,
and in the moment it was
so special to be there. I
wasn’t sure if I would
ever see anything like it
again. In fact, I would
never have usually chosen
to see something like this
but I’m glad I did. With
my newfound wisdom,
my advice is: if you ever
see an advertisement for
a slightly strange pro-
duction like this, take a
chance and give it a go.
F
uneral Flowers,
written and per-
formed by Emma
Dennis Edwards,
is about 17-year-old
Angelique, aspiring
florist trying to withstand
the hardships in her life
that strike at her resolve
time and time again. With
a powerful protagonist
accompanying an equally
powerful script of lyrical
verse and North London
slang, Edwards deftly
plays multiple characters
to give us the full picture
of what goes on in her
world. We see her for the
most part as herself, but
also playing her foster
mum, floristry teacher,
mother, and boyfriend – a
feat that requires real
talent and should be
applauded.
We see a vulnerability
to Angelique behind her
confident exterior, and
how experiencing sexual
violence at the hands of
her boyfriend and his
gang changes her as she
tries to gather the strength
to move past it. We see
her thought processes as
she speaks to us, trying
to justify things in her
mind to convince herself
she’s okay even though
the things that happen
to her are not okay and
neither is she – something
that many women can
relate to. The way she
performs this scene is
ingenious; she calls the
audience to the middle
of the room and we all sit
on the floor looking up at
her as she performs this
heart-wrenching mono-
logue. From then on, the
play takes a darker turn
as we see a blatant shift in
her personality though she
tries to conceal her pain.
By seeing everything
feels startlingly like a real
person – she could easily
be someone we know,
or even ourselves. What
makes the play all the
more emotional is that as
sad as the story is, it isnt
actually unique at all, and
everyone in the audience
knows that. We’ve heard
or lived through countless
permutations of the same
story. The open-ended
finish, where we don’t
know whether Angelique
really does move past it
or not, whether she fulfils
her dreams or is doomed
to a life like her mother’s,
mirrors the uncertainty
we all feel as we move
through life very realisti-
cally.
The stage was sur-
rounded with flowers,
making the room smell
beautiful despite the
intense subject matters,
and the immersive aspect
of the performance that
required us to follow her
around the room at times,
made this play unique,
and definitely one to
remember. I’d highly rec-
ommend seeing this play,
and be sure to look out for
Emma Dennis Edwards’s
next performance.

there is such a thing as

Not to worry, for there are

Cold brew, made by

years. Of course it makes
an appearance here. And

the ubiquitous alcohol-if-

T
here were a whole
host of events
for coffee-lovers
to enjoy – from
latte-making, to coffee
cocktail masterclasses,
to Q&A sessions with
experts, and an art gal-
lery where caffeinated
wanderers could fuel
their coffee-loving habits
some sort of non-human,
alien entity, especially
with movements that took
their inspiration from
different animals.
My only criticism is
that in some places it
seemed a little boring;
the transitions between
‘scenes’ tended to drag on
a bit, so in this regard a few
cuts wouldn’t have gone
amiss. However, maybe
the decision to have them
there was to maintain the
delicate, almost unnerving
atmosphere, which was
created partly thanks to
the musical compositions
of Marihiko Hara and
Ryūichi Sakamoto – less
‘music’ in the traditional
sense, and more of a
soundscape. Though I’m
still not sure of what it all
represented, the move-
ments matched the score
perfectly. It seemed to
be about nature and life;
through Angelique’s
perspective, we get to see
the development of this
multi-layered, three-di-
mensional character,
something that is difficult
to achieve to this degree
when performing as an
ensemble cast. She is
outspoken and chatty yet
uncertain, has potential to
succeed but is held back
by her experiences. She
