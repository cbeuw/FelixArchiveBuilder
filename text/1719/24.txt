(ICUTKD) travelled to
Worcester from 16th to
17th March for Spring
Championships, the final
competition by British
Student Taekwondo
Federation (BSTF).
Students entered the
individual and team
poomsae and sparring for
both World Taekwondo
(WT) and International
Taekwondo Federation
(ITF).
In this event alone,
competitors earned a total
of 40 medals; 6 gold,
17 silver, and 17 bronze
across all disciplines.
ICUTKD were awarded
1st place in Kukkiwon
poomsae, 3rd place for
ITF sparring, and 4th
place overall amongst 61
institutions nationwide.
This was an excellent way
to mark countless hours
of practice with Bryan
Chong, ICUTKD Chair
2018-19, who helped
dramatically improve the
club’s quality in poomsae.
BSTF holds three
competitions as part of
a championships series.
Each student athlete accu-
mulates points throughout
the series and the club
with the most points is
awarded the overall prize
at the end of the Spring
Championship. Alumni
can also compete but will
not carry points for their
representing club. Entries
are open for WT and ITF
poomsae and sparring for
all classes, beginners and
experienced alike.
For those unfamiliar,
taekwondo is a Korean
martial art, and WT
sparring has been an
Olympic Sports since
1988. Poomsae is also
known as forms or
patterns, where there are
sequences of moves con-
sisting of stances, blocks,
punches and kicks. In WT,
poomsae is also called
“Kukkiwon patterns”,
and in ITF “Chang-hon
patterns”.
Our Spring Champi-
onships medallists for
Kukkiwon Patterns, indi-
vidual, are: Bryan Chong
(bronze), Sophia Ppali
(bronze), Claire Tjokroid-
jaja (bronze), Joonho Son
(gold), Andrew Bates
(bronze), and Cynthia Ho
(gold). In pairs: Bryan
Chong and Sojin Park
(silver), Sophia Ppali
and Joonho Son (silver),
Andrew Bates and Lucy
Lei (gold), Myriam
Belmekki and Thomas
Kloska (silver). In teams:
Bryan Chong, Sojin
Park, Syazana Hisham
(silver) and Andrew
Bates, Cynthia Ho, Lucy
Lei (bronze). Bryan
Chong also earned a gold
in freestyle poomsae, a
self-choreographed set of
moves in time with music
of choice. Our medallists
for Chang-hon individual
patterns are: Wenbo Chen
(bronze), Claire Tjokroid-
jaja (bronze), Michael
Ogunjimi (silver). Pairs:
Angela Sun and Wenbo
Chen (bronze) and teams:
Angela Sun, Wenbo Chen,
Brandon Tollan (silver).
WT sparring, also
known as kyorugi, is
full-contact, so competi-
tors wear body armour and
guards on the head, arms,
hands, shins and feet.
The rules are as follows:
1 point for punch to the
body, 2 or 3 for kick to the
body or head respectively,
4 or 5 for spinning/ reverse
kick to the body or head
respectively. In B and
C-class, these are scored
by corner judges whereas
electronic sensors are
used in A-class. In ITF
sparring, all points are
scored by corner judges
(typically three of four
judges) and the winner is
revealed at the end of the
match. 1 point for a punch
to body, 2 or 3 points are
scored for a kick to the
body or head respectively.
ITF sparrers wear more
padding on guards for feet
and hands with no body
armours so sparring is
semi-contact. In both dis-
ciplines, competitors are
matched by class, gender
and weight categories.
Medallists for WT
sparring are: Jamie
McNeil (bronze), Sojin
Park (bronze), Claire
Tjokroidjaja (bronze),
Sharmila Rana (gold),
Thomas Kloska (silver),
Myriam Belmekki
(bronze) and Nick Hyunh
(bronze). Jamie McNeil
and Bryan Chong have
qualified for the European
Universities Sports
Association (EUSA)
Champions this August
in Italy, an exciting
opportunity offered by
BSTF in association with
EUSA for qualifying WT
A-class fighters. For ITF
sparring: Angela Sun
(silver), Savya Aggarwal
(bronze), Wenbo Chen
(silver), Claire Tjokroid-
jaja (silver) and Michael
Ogunjimi (bronze) have
earned their well-deserved
medals.
ICUTKD are proud to
say that despite sustaining
injuries from compe-
titions, we keep our
spirits strong. As a club,
we welcome everyone;
those who have never
kicked, seniors who are
looking for a new club,
and everyone in between.
This was demonstrated
from the strong bonds we
made this year and many
of our competitors and
volunteers were new to
the club.
Congratulations to all
medallists and non-med-
allists in Taekwondo who
competed this year repre-
senting Imperial College
London.
We express many
thanks to our instructors
and coaches Master
Reza Saberi, Christopher
Dancel and Liyan Chow
who give endless support
throughout the years.
It has been a fantastic
academic year 2018-19
for ICUTKD: from our
summer tour to Singa-
pore, to many evenings
at the Student Activity
Spaces in preparation for
competitions.
