A
fter months of
work, to-ing
and fro-ing,
proposition
after proposition and
refusal after refusal we
here in the NegaFelix
team finally managed
to get a date for our
interview. A single
message, starting with
a code word to establish
identity, coming from
an anonymous number
“4th Floor. 1 am.” It
came without warning
and we knew that it was
non negotiable. It was
either now or never. So
we went.
Further messages
guided us as we walked
between rows of cubicles.
They were all around
us, watching, guiding,
waiting. We had no illu-
sions, we were on their
turf now and they could
do what they wanted to us.
We were guided to a
corner cubicle where a
shell of a person sat. They,
(we couldn’t confirm the
gender) sat dressed in a
sleeping bag zipped up
to the neck, surrounded
long. Swarming out
from the neck line the
lice emerged. They were
polite, offering us drinks
and food (well prepared
and piping hot).
everyone tries to wash a bit
more to impress someone
or other but we have safe
places. Huxley is always a
fertile pasture.”
He held himself with
great poise, telling us
about the various efforts
he made to keep his
people safe. “However,
it is time” he proclaimed.
“Time for us to come out
of the shadows and to take
our rightful place.”
When we asked
whether this was not a
strange attitude for a par-
asite to have, he got very
angry shouting that we
were very full of ourselves
for “horses”.
We managed to calm
him down by asking about
the summer holidays.
Surely people are out and
about and very clean.
He laughed “God no.
They’re all way too busy
wanking”
The lice would like you
to please not panic//
