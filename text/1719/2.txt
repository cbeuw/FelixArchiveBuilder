The beginning of the end...
W
ith a title
like that,
a n y o n e
w o u l d
think I don't like this
job. We're approaching
my final eight issues of
Felix, not that I'm count-
ing or anything. We're
really in the Endgame...
In all seriousness, I
love my job. What other
job do you know of where
you can enjoy a month of
"working from home"?
Suffice to say, I've had
a wonderfully relaxing
Easter break and I'm now
raring to go, ready to
bring you quality content
to get you through the
exam period.
This term, we've got
a whole host of exciting
things planned for Felix.
Ever wondered how many
people have got busy in
the library? Well look no
further because this term
will see the return of the
annual Felix Sex Survey.
I will save my Avengers
Endgame discussion until
next week for those of you
who still haven't watched
it (although, if you've
managed to last this long
without seeing it, you
should be counting your
lucky stars). Look out
for an Endgame-themed
article from Grumpy
Bastard, who was less
than impressed with pro-
ceedings.
Finally, you might have
noticed the advert below.
Yes, that's right, we are
looking for submissions
and for people to join the
team of Imperial's new
music magazine! Title to
be determined still... but
if you have an interest in
Grime & Black British
music and want to be
2
involved in something
special, drop us a line.
You'd think as we
approach the final few
issues of Felix, I'd have
improved at writing these.
Sadly, you'd be mistaken.
You might also think I
would have improved
at my job, learnt how
to meet deadlines, etc.
Wrong again mate. It's
past midnight right now
and I'm severely strug-
gling to waffle for another
column. The printers are
already fed up with me
and it's the first day back.
I was presently sur-
prised to see diversity &
inclusivity make its way
to the library with the in-
troduction of a jollof rice
vending machine! I can't
lie to you, this is the most
exciting News I've seen
since I started the role. It's
Nigerian jollof but still,
I'll survive.
I want to end this with
my customary shoutout
to the Felix fam. I really
didn't think we'd be able
to spin enough content
for more than 24 pages
an issue this term but you
pulled it out of the bag.
Special shoutout to the
Arts section. Your tireless
work has turned your
section into a well-oiled
machine and it's almost
inevitable that you will
receive section of the
week. With that being
said, I'm not giving you
section of the week. The
Film Section had a strong
week this week too but I'm
going to reward myself
because I really like
my review of Michelle
Obama's Becoming - head
to the Books Section to
check it out!

& Black British music, we want
to hear from you!
What does Grime mean to
you?
