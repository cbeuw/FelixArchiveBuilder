Professor Simone
Buitendijk, Imperial's
Vice Provost
(Education), sat down
with Felix for an
exclusive interview on
all things education
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
I
t's been two years
since Imperial began
the overhaul of its
curriculum through
the Learning and Teaching
Strategy and, with the
launch of increased digital
learning - online degrees,
a studio space and the
use of Vitual Reality in
courses such as Chemical
Engineering and Medicine
- it's certainly an exciting
time to discuss upcoming
changes to education at
Imperial. Vice Provost
(Education), Professor
Simone Buitendijk, told
Felix:
"There are all kinds of
different developments.
The Digital Learning
Strategy is part of the
Learning and Teaching
Strategy, which I think is
actually really important
and exciting, it also gives
the College a niche. The
online courses are really
visible and exciting and
we have two now in
the making – one is the
Master's in Global Public
Health, which will start
in the autumn, and then
another one is Master's
in Machine Learning
and Data Science by the
Maths Department; that’s
been announced just early
this month and we’re
hoping to actually launch
that in the autumn of next
year, 2020. The Digital
Learning Hub, which is
another big development
- we have an experimental
classroom and a studio
and desk space for editors,
where we’re going to
invite people in there,
teachers who want to
teach more interactively
and want to try new tech-
nology in existing courses
for our own students to
see how we may make the
learning experience better.
On the prospect of
increased use of Virtual
Reality in teaching,
Simone said the follow-
ing:
"Now that’s a really
exciting development.
One of the new people in
the Digital Learning Hub
is a specialist in AR/ VR
and he’s now going round
talking to lots of people
about how to bring that
into the teaching and it’s
so fun to see people from
different areas of exper-
tise, like Omar with Fluid
Mechanics and people in
Medicine around surgery,
work together on how to
bring this into the actual
education. It’s still very
early days but it’s really
promising. We’re very
much ahead of the curve
there. Of course, it really
fits our profile, being so
STEM-focused."
Professor Buitendijk
has also been insturmen-
tal in driving forward
general improvements on
the student experience.
With the College about
to launch an awareness
campaign on Sexual
Violence Liaison Officers,
the topic of student well-
being also came up in
discussion.
Felix: I just want to
gauge where we’re at
with improving the
education experience
since launching the
learning and teaching
strategy
Simone: We’re doing
very well. It’s early days
still. We actively started
only a year and a half ago
and we’ve already done
the complete curriculum
review, which I’m really
proud of and that was a
huge amount of work for
every department.Every
department has reviewed
its undergraduate curricu-
lum; the students coming
in this autumn will all start
on the new curriculum and
that curriculum has more
space for innovations, less
focused on assessments
and exams and particular
ways of testing, so it’s not
just curriculum review but
also assessment review.
The curriculum, the hard
bit of actually formally
reviewing it, that just
needed to happen and
I’m really proud of all
the teams that have done
it. We’re ready to go into
a new era with our new
curriculum.
Can you go into a bit
moredetailintowhere
the money is being
spent/ was spent
The Provost's Board
approved the Learning
and Teaching Strategy and
then, as a consequence of
that, we got the budget for
the first two years. We’ve
spent it, to a large degree,
on the curriculum review
because we were very
aware that we can’t ask
people who are already
so busy with everything
just to take on another
huge piece of work like
curriculum review so
we’ve given all the de-
partments that have gone
through it extra help with
extra teaching fellows;
they’ve all done that so a
large chunk of money has
gone into that. Most of
the teaching fellows that
have been appointed have
been appointed on four-
year contracts because
we knew we wouldn’t be
done in two years. We’re
expecting departments
to keep moving and now
implement the curriculum
review with the existing
teaching fellows and that
will take care of the next
batch of money. Another
big spend has been to
create faculty-wide teams
in the faculties of Natural
Cciences and Engineering
to think about digital
transformation. The
Digital Learning Hub also
has its own budget. Those
are the three biggest
pieces, apart from smaller
projects that we’ve also
funded that help towards
what we’re trying to do.
Could you shed
some light on some
of the challenges
that you’ve faced
and also challenges
that you foresee
with implementing
the Learning and
Teaching Strategy.
I think they’re chal-
lenges that face everybody
who’s trying to implement
a big change program
because it really needs a
different way of thinking
about teaching. Most
research-intensive univer-
sities, and Imperial was
no exception, aren’t really
focused that much on
thinking about teaching.
We all have been taught
a certain way, we’re very
successful people, so we
just assume that we’d
be doing that because it
works. To tell people that
maybe there’s not a lot
of evidence for lecturing
as the primary way of
teaching and, in this day
and age, it’s very impor-
tant to build that sense of
community and work with
students as partners, that’s
a big culture change.
Thereareloadsofteaching
fellows who are really
excited about this; they’re
teachers and researchers
who have already been
trying things, people like
David Dye have been
doing this for quite a few
years now but they’ve
been working in relative
isolation and now this
is something that we all
want to embrace. Getting
everybody on board, that
requires culture change, it
requires careful manage-
ment, it requires reward-
ing the right behaviours
and especially moving out
of doing things on your
own. For me, the most
important thing is collab-
oration and getting out of
the relative competitive
nature that we have. If
we want the College to
become a better place for
our students as a group,
it’s really important to
focus on collaboration
and making sure that we
implement all the good
examples, we look at the
parity of experience for
students. I think that’s
really important, that it
doesn’t depend on which
department you’re in to
have a good experience,
that every Imperial student
needs to have a good
experience in everything.
One thing I also really
love is the fact that we
now have the Centre
for Higher Education
Research and Scholarship
led by Martyn Kingsbury.
That was previously only
EDU [Educational Devel-
opment Unit] and now it’s
much bigger. It’s really
looking at making sure
that what we’re doing gets
evaluated, that we don’t
implement things that
aren’t working.
Vice Provost (Education), Professor Simone Buitendijk // Imperial College London
I get the sense from
listening to you that
one of the main aims
of implementing
the learning and
teaching strategy is to
garner a tighter-knit
community within
Imperial.
I think it’s also creating
a sense of community
in the classroom and
the breakout spaces, not
just the community in
the Union, where people
come together to play
sports and socialise, but
also a sense of community
with the teachers and with
eachother.
I just wanted to know
how students have
shapedthecurriculum
review.
Students have been
involved. We’re working
really closely with the
Union reps; they’re pretty
much in every meeting,
we’re getting lots of
feedback from them
and they, of course, are
engaged with departmen-
tal reps, so we’re trying
as much as possible to
get students on board in
the design. As much as
possible, students also
delivered their input and
that’s certainly how we
want to go forward. It’s
very important to not just
ask students what they feel
but also make them part
of the team that’s building
this new way of working.
Some things we’ll be
trying for the first time
here and we won’t know
what works for students
unless we do it together,
work with them, get that
really quick feedback.
Provide some
information about
I-Explore please.
That’s one of the
exciting developments. In
the new curriculum, every
undergraduate student
needs to have a five credit
point space somewhere
in their curriculum, it
can be in the 2nd
year or
3rd
year, to do something
entirely different from
their core curriculum and
it counts towards their
degree. It will be pass/fail
because that was easier
and more acceptable and
we’re hoping to have a
big choice of options;
Horizons is going to be
part of it, the Business
for Engineering Students
(BPES) is going to be
part of it. We’re going to
develop much more and
one of the ideas that the
students brought in was
multidisciplinary projects
because that’s one thing
that students really want
- more projects but then
working with students
from very different dis-
ciplinary backgrounds.
We’re asking departments
to start developing those
kind of projects.
How would you
say Imperial rates
teaching-wise right
now and how do you
think it will rate once
the curriculum review
and the Learning and
Teaching Strategy are
implemented?
I think right now we
rate sort of average. I
don’t think we’re that
different from many
super research-intensive
universities, especially in
Europe, but I don’t feel
that’s good enough for us.
We’re so good in terms
of our research and my
vision is that, in terms
of our education, we’ll
be rated just as highly as
we are in terms of our
research. I don’t feel that
there’s any competition
there, that either you’re
really good at research or
good at education, I think
it can go really hand-in-
hand and where we have
research-led education. I
think we’re superbly posi-
tioned to make that work.
We’ve just started so, if we
keep doing this, if we get
to the level where the new
way of thinking and the
new community building
actually starts becoming a
reality for every Imperial
student, I think we’re
going to be very much
ahead of the curve and
an example for lots of
other universities. I don’t
know of any university
on this planet that does it
university-wide. Cornell.
for instance, have done it
with their science faculty,
University of British
Columbia have done it
with a few faculties but,
because we’re relatively
homogeneous in terms of
our topics, we can do it
university-wide. I think
that’s going to generate its
own momentum because
it’s for every student; it’s
not just if you’re in the
science faculty, you’re
lucky but, if you’re in
another faculty, you’re
not.
Are there any other
ways, outside of
the Learning and
Teaching Strategy,
that Imperial could
improve on the
education front?
I think the Learning and
Teaching Strategy is an
engine for bigger change
but, eventually, it will
need to go into all kinds
of other areas aswell.
For instance, the career
prospects of teachers and
researchers - how serious-
ly do we take education
as a career - that’s hardly
part of the Learning and
Teaching Strategy but
it also needs to go into
our research strategy.
Thinking about students’
wellbeing more broadly,
what student services are
doing, thinking about how
we work together between
departments; with the
Learning and Teaching
Strategy as an engine for
collaboration and thinking
about parity of experi-
ence for students, we’ll
probably see that will
start creeping into other
areas of the College and
a wider culture and sense
of belonging. I focused
on students but I think if
our students have a very
positive, good sense of
belonging, I can’t imagine
that wouldn’t also change
how our staff and teachers
feel about the College and
being part of an exciting
community.
How can students
get involved in
increasing that sense
of community?
Students are getting
involved and I think we
are going to try and make
that happen more. In
almost every committee
that we now start, we are
very aware we need good
student representation
and, if students who read
your article would like to
be involved, I think the
invitation to go to their
representatives and say,
“we want to be involved”,
is an open invitation.
How do the
improvements in the
teaching strategy
etc. look outside of
the classroom, with
regards to the student
experience and
wellbeing?
future of education at Imperial
Well that’s one of the
things that we’re very
aware of, that we could
do better in terms of, for
instance, student spaces
and common rooms and
places for students to
come together. It’s also
the layout on campus
and how we make that
work - that’s going to be
another big piece of work.
We know we can’t just
focus on classrooms, even
though they also need im-
proving, but also breakout
spaces, common rooms.
The conversation ended
with discussions on the
National Student Survey
(NSS), a postgraduate
pilot version of which
is soon to be launched.
Simone's final remarks
were:
"After last year’s NSS
results, I’ve actually
convened an NSS working
group; first we were going
to look at quick fixes,
which we have identified,
but it’s been a really
positive exercise and
we’re going to continue
coming together. It's
Heads of Departments
and tutors, it’s very much
a cross-College group
that basically started by
sharing good examples
of how we can change
student experiences posi-
tively so even departments
that weren’t doing so
well in the NSS still had
good examples. It’s been
really amazing group and
students, of course, are
very much involved and
telling us what’s impor-
tant for them. I think we’ll
keep that group up and
running after the next NSS
results, whether they’re
good or bad or medium, it
almost doesn’t matter, we
just need to keep thinking
about how to improve the
student experience."
When asked which
"quick fixes" have been
implemented already,
Professor Buitendijk told
Felix:
"One quick fix that
came up from a few
departments was having
student staff parties
at the beginning of an
academic year. People
really enjoyed that and
it’s not that expensive and
we don’t really have to
do a whole lot of work to
make that happen. Things
like that and, for instance,
knowing that the common
room is really important
and, of course, that’s not
fixed as easily when you
don’t have one but at
least saying to eachother,
'every student should have
their own common room'.
It’s been really useful to
compare and hear people
talk proudly about the way
they deal with the issues
and what they’ve done
in their department and
using that for inspiration."
