Spanish socialists win big in a fragmented
parliament while the far-right gets
representation for the first time

rime Minister
Pedro Sánchez’s
Spanish Socialist
Workers Party
(PSOE in Spanish) won
a commanding victory in
the general election held
last Sunday in Spain.
Despite being far from
wining an absolute ma-
jority of seats, something
that rarely happens due to
the relatively proportional
voting system and the
high number of major par-
ties (five in this election),
Sánchez will find it quite
easy to get his current
position reconfirmed,
due to the good results of
most of his parliamentary
allies. With a moderately
high turnout (75.8%) and
a record number of ballots
(more than 26 million),
the election also saw the
far-right Vox enter the
chamber for the first time,
though with fewer seats
than what the polls had
foreseen.
PSOE won 123 seats
and 28.7% of the vote,
an increase from the 85
seats and 22.6% they had
the last time the country
went to the polls in 2016.
They also were able to
be victorious in 40 of the
51 provinces of Spain,
topping the poll in areas
where a left-wing party
had not won since the
80s. The party got into
government in May 2018
after Sánchez successfully
toppled the right-wing
People’s Party (PP) Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy
via a motion of censure
against the government,
after a law court found
PP as an organisation to
be guilty of several cor-
ruption charges. Sánchez
can now choose between
renewing the supply and
confidence agreement he
had with the left-wing
Together We Can (UP)
and the Basque and
Catalan nationalists or
seeking the support of the
resurgent Citizens (Cs), a
liberal party that was the
other winner of the night.
PP, led by the young
a ‘traitor’ that had sold
the country to Catalan
nationalists. While he
has announced that he
will not resign before
the next poll day (local
and European elections
will be held in less than a
month), Casado’s position
as leader of the opposition
was severely threatened
by Cs’Albert Rivera, who
finished less than a per-
centage point behind him.
Indeed, Rivera saw his
party becoming the third
largest in the country,
gaining a further 25 seats
to reach a grand total
of 57. His strategy of
adopting PP’s abandoned
centre-right ideological
position proved to be quite
popular, though it could
arguably be said that his
anti-Catalan and Basque
nationalist zeal was even
stronger than that of
PP. Rivera now intends
to become the de facto
leader of the opposition as
PP’s crisis worsens.
While not as dramatic
as PP’s, Pablo Iglesias’s
UP also had a bad night
at the polls. They lost 29
seats to 42, got 14.3% of
the vote and fell from their
past position as the third
largest party to the one
below that. The party lost
a considerable amount
of its voters to Sánchez,
who successfully adopted
the strategy of presenting
itself as the only party
that could successfully
stop the far right from
getting into power. UP
was also damaged by
the continuous internal
war between its factions
that saw several of their
most high-profile MPs
out of the leader’s team.
However, the fall in vote
percentage and seats was
less that what the polls
predicted, and they will
probably still have con-
siderable influence over
Sánchez’s government,
as its support is needed
to achieve a majority of
votes in parliament.
Vox entered the
chamber for the first time
with 24 seats and 10.3%
of the vote. The far right
party that was created
by former PP members
that split from the main
organisation used the
campaign to demonise
ethnic and sexual mi-
norities and adopted a
strong anti-feminist,
anti-Basque, anti-Catalan
discourse, influenced by
the Catholic Church and
by the ideology of the
fascist Franco regime that
ruled the country with an
iron grip for 40 years. Its
results are less impressive
that what the opinion
polls were showing the
days before the election,
which are probably a con-
sequence of the several
scandals they were em-
broiled with, with several
members in exit positions
in the party lists revealed
as Holocaust deniers and
wife beaters. In fact, the
biggest effect that Vox
had was increasing the
turnout of the left-wing
supporting electorates,
who flocked to the polls
to stop the extremist party
from giving PP and Cs
the numbers to form a
government coalition.
Basque and Catalan
nationalists also achieved
a great result, winning
the election in the Basque
Country and Catalonia.
However, the more
moderate parties within
thecurrent(PNVandERC,
respectively) managed to
come above their more
radical counterparts (EH
Bildu and JxCat, the party
of former Catalan PM
Puigdemont, who is cur-
rently in Belgium outside
the reach of the Spanish
courts after the failed
independence referendum
in 2017). ERC, which also
participated in the ref-
erendum and saw its lead-
ership jailed, has shown
willingness to moderate
its positions and reach an
agreement with Sánchez
for parliamentary support
in return for further
autonomy for Catalonia.
Its former leader Oriol
Junqueras, (who is cur-
rently detained and under
trial for the independence
declaration) was elected
to parliament, through it
is not clear if the courts
will grant him permission
to take his seat.

and fiery Pablo Casado,
suffered its heaviest defeat
in history. The party
managed to get 66 MPs,
less than half of that of
of the last election, went
below 20% of the vote
(16.7%) for the first time
since the early 80s, and
only barely won in their
rural strongholds of Lugo,
Ourense, Zamora and
Salamanca. The party’s
policies and rhetoric had
moved well to the right
to face off the challenge
of the upcoming Vox, the
campaign being marked
by Casado’s incendiary
branding of the PM as
“The far right
party used
the campaign
to demonise
ethnic and
sexual
minorities
and adopted
a strong anti-
feminist,
anti-Basque,
anti-Catalan
discourse”
