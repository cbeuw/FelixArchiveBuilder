FELIX
M E & M Y G H O U L
Perhaps i t was the date, or the
approach of Spring, or something.
Last Friday the I J t h of March was the
Mines Carnival - the b i g effort o f
Alan Lewis, the Mines Entertainments
Officer. Dogged by that date, and the
fact that everyone else was doing some-
thing else, the cabaret was given i t s
f i r s t rehearsal on the night of March
the 13th - hardly auspicious. How-
ever, the high spot o f the offering that
was presented was a rather neat and
t o p i c a l song a l l about a book published
by the B.M.A. - including 3Uch admoni-
tions as "The Bride-to-be, Should read
Page 3n
« Otherwise, i t was easy to
spot the good intentions behind the sket-
ches, i f not the polished performance.
Mr. Lewis certainly earns his position,
for he appeared i n several guises
throughout the proceedings.
The f l a t s were ingenious and s u i t -
ably ghoulish - but not half so ghoul-
ish as some of the costumes that appear-
ed; I.C. appears to have some avid
readers of horror comics.
The food was available, and by ^
that I mean that i t was possible to get
at i t and everybody seemed s a t i s f i e d ,
c e r t a i n l y i t was welcome.
One feature that was a marked
improvement on previous carnivals was
the band - t h i s was outstanding and the
dancing was a l l the more enjoyable.
I t was perhaps unfortunate that
several of the more vociferous of the
College's interrupters were present,
some very loud - and, admittedly, per-
tinent comments were to be heard.

new jouraa
;
j;iion heard of plans
for a new journal at the Union Meeting
held last wee';. I t w i l l reolacs the
old S c i e n t i f i c Journal which had "been
in decline f o r the l a s t few years.
The new journal w i l l deal with acc-
ounts of res 3-arch aone i n R.C.S. w r i t -
ten i n a popular vsin irailar to the
New Scientist. I t w i l l aslo contain
Union news. The journal w i l l be
edited by MicH;.el Banks who said that
there w i l l be no question of copying
or competing with Phoenix.
After t h i s serious business the
Union settled down to a more lighthear-
ted motion that 'The R.C.S. Union ain't,
wot i t used t'be'. Prof. Hewer, pre-'
posing the motion, t o l d of the good o l d
dayr- of P.G.°. i n the early 2^s.
R.C.S. d i d net have any trophies or
residents clad i n gay raiment. Hav-
ing no trophies was an advantage, the
trophies make a college much more
vulnerable.
In 1920 and'2-l R.C.S. joined with
the lesser colleges of I.C. to give
jight to the United Hospitals at a
push b a l l match l i m i t e d to 300 a side,
one set of goal rosts being the
Marble Arch, the other Hyde Park.
The punctured b a l l adorned the union,
as did the helmet of the gentleman who
punctured the b a l l with a jacknife.
In those days R.C.S. wen the
Horphy; Mines having sunk and Guilds
were l e v e l with the water.
Mike Amos opposing the motion enu-
merated the sport and social successes
of the l a s t few years; R.C.S. have won
the Technology cur f o r the l a s t 5 years,
won the Lowry t h i s year f o r the f i r s t
time i n l i v i n g memory have done well i n
the Rector's Cup- they were only 3
-)Oints behind the winners. On the
social side, R.C.S. i s the only con-
stituent college to produce scng and
dance teams from i t s college. Also
Jezebel, with her jueen, i s r e l i a b l e
beyond doubt.
Dr. Dr-lziel speaking of P.C.S.
i n the Jjfts told the union of one of
i t s presidents who actually saved,
money from his grant and moved a motion
from the chair that students should save
money from t h e i r grants av,
d send .
, t back
to the authorities.
John Dewey said that the proposi-
t i o n had based t h e i r arguments on old
orgies. The Kangella i s now a cha-
cha and l a s t Christmas we l o s t an
eminent entomologist who used t o s i t
on china objects i n the snack bar.
Mr. ^orster, dressed i n a t a i l
coat, swimming trunks and a lavatory
brush was embarassed by the subtleties
of the previous speakers. We are i n
danger of losing our metaphorical
trousers, he told the meeting. The
danger to the Onion i s complacency.
After Mr. Forster had finished
his act i.ie motion was carried.
