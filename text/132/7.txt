PLAYER-COACH MIKE BARRON
I.C. WIN WOOLWICH PLAQUE
Suf i'ering under t i e fate Of the
'draw* Imperial College had the mis-
fortune of having t o play i n a minor
league consistin- of Regent St.Poly-
technic, one of the country's finest
junior teams, and Oxford University,
whose average height was over 6'3"
and average weight 11st.+ (making the
I.C.5'10" 1 1 s t . — look small.) With
tiiis 'draw' i n mind a comparatively
small team of s i x players was taken
( a mistake which nearly cost the
P l a t e . ) , and the f i r s t match with
R.S,P#was regarded as a mere formality
on the Poly's side. But suddenly
the I.C. team clicked. The defence
was s o l i d and almost impregnable,
the attack combined well, and by
half-time held a good lead of
20 pts - 10 pts.
Poly t r i e d hard but could not
overcOfne I.C.'s superior play
f i n a l l y acceptin- defeat by 44pts
to 23pts.
Mike Barron was the star with
his 1 st half 12 pts.
In the next match we had the
great pleasure of meeting the
•Texan Giants' to determine whether
we went into the 'Plate' ( runners up)
or the 'Cup' ( winners) P i n a l .
Outplayed i n the a i r , I.C.
nad t o defend on the speed of their
team and the accuracy of t h e i r set-
shot men, M.Barron and D.Parker.
Result, I.C. 24 p t s . - Oxford Univ.34 pts
Par the semi-final game with
Northampton Engineering College i t
became obvious that taking only s i x
players v/as an oversight on our part.
As we t i r e d we l e f t the winning of t h i s
game to t le coach Mike Barron/,
who agreeably obliged with a devastating
display o f set-shots ( c o l l e c t i n g I8pts.)
winning by 30pts to 12pts.
So we had reached the P i n a l . A
very weary and footsore I.C. team
prepared to meet a f i t t e r Chelsea
Team (having had a b e ) . The game
followed the course. At the half-
way mark we held a one point lead.
Egged on by player coach, (by f a r
the most important person, whose 26pts
and 6' 3" proved invaluable) won the
'Plate'Pinal' by 54pts - 41 pts.
(Interesting fact: Oxford Univ.
trounced L.S.E. by 60pts - 21 pts.
i n the semi-final, and thrashed
Woolwich Poly, by 80pts. - 24pts
to win the cup. I.C. were the
only team to run them close).

There was a fixture with B r i s t o l
University on 25th February, but due
to unfavourable conditions - a r i s i n g
tide and an unusually large number of
tugs - we did not race, and compromised
with a paddle over course from Putney
to Mortlake.
The Reading Head of the River
race on 14th March brought the 1st
VIII up to 10th from a starting
position of 12th. Though the f i r s t
few minutes were somewhat ragged after
a bad start the V I I I soon shook down
tc an ever, rhythym. 2nd and 3rd VIIIs
though dropping some Places d i d not Ax
disgrace themselves completely.
The last fixtures this term 'is the
Tideway Head from Mortlake t o Putney Oil
Saturday 21 st March. 1,0. i s s t a r t -

invaluable!
The start i a a t 3.00 p.m.

Away from the limelight, the "B"
CV have enjoyed a very f r u i t f u l season.
On the morning of the "Gup Day"
they brought the season t o a f i t t i n g
end by beating of the challenge of the
"3x?" XV to the tune of 12 points t o

t i l P. Potter crossed i n the corner.
This was m tinly due t c the tackling and
covering of centre Terry.
In the second ..all, u>tnciOriing cup-
t i e t a c t i c s i l l honour of good open foot-
b a l l , the XV scored two mere t r i e s
Potter ended a splendid performance with
s hat-trick, the other t r y being scored
by the other wing Davies.

Last Sunday, March 8th saw the l a s t
race i n the University points Champion-
ship. The series was so closely fought
that the positions of the f i r s t four
boats hinged on the result of t h i s race.
For the f i r s t time t h i s year a
points race was sailed i n a reasonable
wind. The race which was very keenly
fought was won by Graham Taylor (I.C.)
(minus his trousers) and closely follow-
ed by Miss Jenny Moore of Bedford.
.'s a r e s u l t Jenny Moore won the
Championship beating Graham Taylor by
1 point i n a t o t a l of over 300. A
Q.M.C. boat was t h i r d and another I.C.
boat was fourth, sailed by Janisz
vVilczynski _ w e n clear of the rest of
the f l e e t of over 30 boats.
Oh the 14th./15th. March the
University s a i l i n g Club held their
annual champienshir s. I n the Rsy Trcphy
(two handed) Janisz .Vilezynski came
t h i r d and Graham Taylor f i f t h , out o f
a f l e e t of forty. The single handed
result..(Nion Trophy) was Grahan
Taylor a close second, and Desmond
Turner ninth, out of t h i r t y .
I would l i k e t o thank GORDON
LOWE and FRED PEACOCK for the soccer
and boxing photographs of l a s t issue.

The winter f i x t u r e l i s t s have now
been completed. The standard of play
has improved, p r t l y due t o the increase
i n numbers i n the Club. But we s t i l l
require more s p i r i t and conscientious
support. We hope that a l l members of
IaOaW.S.C. w i l l be able to benefit from
the Tennis coaching scheme planned f o r
next term*
The much improved Squash team suff-
ered an overwhelming defeat from the
v i s i t i n g Cardiff team. Although some
hard games were fought I«CW.S,C, were
unable to win one match.
In ide 1 conditions the Hockey team
(2 short) played L.S.E. i n the l a s t game
of the season. The battle was long and
furious,; I.C.W.S.C, only conceding one
goal towards the end.
The T b l e Tennis team h ve great
pleasure i n announcing a victory.
