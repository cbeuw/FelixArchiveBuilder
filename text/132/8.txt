Last Monday and Wednesday the
Swimming Championships were staged
at the University Pool, Malet Street.
During the oourse of the evening
nearly every existing record was
shattered. Battersea, the favourites
won the t i t l e t h i s year, with I.C., the
holders, f i n i s h i n g a good 3econd, just
i n front of Q.M.C. The highlight of
the evening was the medley relay race,
where thanks to a magnificent b u t t e r f l y
swim by Shorey, I.C. just beat Batter-
sea and also lowered the record by
several seconds. In the individual
events Harford, although f i n i s h i n g
second i n the backstoke, retained h i s
University t i t l e , as the winner was not
a member of the Union. Loveman, the
defending breaststroke champion, had
the hard luck, to beat the existing
championship record, yet only finished
t h i r d . Other members who d i d well
included Wilson who came 4th i n the
440, H i l l s f i f t h i n the breaststroke,
and Allcock 6th i n the butterfly.
In the Water Polo League, the most
successful team has been the I.C. t h i r d
team which won the IVth d i v i s i o n with
the following record:
P 6 W 6 GF 20 GA 5 P 12
This i s a very good achievement
considering that
a) i t was only started two years ago as
a sport team,
b) i t i s the only college t h i r d team
playing i n the League.
The two higher teams, although both i n
respectable positions i n t h e i r leagues,
cannot claim any glory. Strengthened
by the return of former I.C. captain
Lampard, tno f i r s t team has improved no
end, and l a s t week beat a strong Q.M.C.
side by 6-3.
Soorers:- -Tones 3, Basham 2, and Shorey

On Friday 27th February I.C. beat
Guy's Hospital 12-6. The f o i l match
provided a very close contest, a number
of bouts going t o assault point. I.C.
eventually won 5-4. However, i n the
sabre, the I.C. team, unbeaten h i s
session, proved i t s undoubted superi-
o r i t y by winning 7-2. For I.C. John
N i c k a l l s , who won a l l s i x of h i s bouts,
was i n exceptionally good form; coming
back i n one bout from being 3-0 down t o
win 4-3.
