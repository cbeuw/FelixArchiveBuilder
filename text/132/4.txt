£ditauat Comment
Why i s i t that as soon as one open
one's mouth i n t h i s College i t i s aut-
omatically assumed that you have "taken
sides" - i t seems impossible t o express
an opinion without being accused of
belonging to the X camp or the t
faction. Perhaps the most obvious and
unfortunate example of t h i s i s when
you say half a word about one aspect of
the Administration of the College -
should you even so much as t o hint that
you think that A i s doing a good job,
then you are "crawling" to the Rector
or to someone else, who w i l l be equally
unaffected by any such behaviour, i n
fact.
The particular incident that has
brought this p a r t i c u l a r l y t o mind was
when recently, I was too careless and
happened t o praise the work of the Ex-
ploration Board, which I s t i l l maintain
does a good job. Thi3 wa3 at once
taken as an attempt t o curry favour with
someone. Since the day you could make
an honest statement of opinion has
apparently passed perhaps i t would be
better t o amend the old quote: "Even
though I agree with what you say, I w i l l
maintain t o the death that you had some
underhand reason f o r saying i t . "

THERMOMETERS* SPANNERS
A c&sual observer at the debate
on 26th February would have found i t
d i f f i c u l t to decide whether he was at
a meeting of the Literary and Debating
Societ- or whether he had strayed into
a l.ines Union meeting.The prescence of
Messrs. Kassler and Clark debating the
motion: "This House prefers Thermometer
to Spanners^', i n the -lining Survey Thea-
tre, right i n the heart of the 3.S.M.
was obviously too much f o r miners.
Thus when the speakers arrive!
they were not suorised to find a house
equipped with newspapers,hootera and a
briefing by Graham King. Undeterred by
the chorus of "We want King", :-':iohard
'rarnett sie~ed the debating haaraer and
pounded f o r eiK»u0h order to introuueo
Leter Kas^ler, iaiantly the ,0,3. Pres*-
i&ent extolled the virtues of the Ther-
iio :eters,each word being followed by
comment of no mean volume from the auc
ienoe.
Dave Clark told how he had h i s te a-
erature taken i n an unusual place
vhile he was i l l i n Sweden. "How was I
to know" he said,"that i t wasn't a daf-
f o d i l . " He had later found out that
this ..as a normal use f o r a thermometer.
The audience response did not diminish
and Graham King, s i t t i n g i n the front
row, kept h i s hand raised for the Chair—
men's attentioo.

plee from John V.'hite f o r ine. of mus-
cle to unite , and .miners and G u i l i s -
men to throw out the motion.
The vote was taken and the motion
defea ed by 38 votes to 8J with 127
abstentions.A blackboard was pulled
iown and a large picture of l/itch rev-
ealed where upon the miners rose and
the meeting closed to the strains of
the fines' national anthem.

STICKING TO EARTH
The motion discussed at the Union
Debate on March 10th was 'That this House
wishes to s t i c k to earth" This was pro-
posed by Mr. H.G. Kull-aan, a lecturer i n
Philosophy at the Royal College of A r t ,
and an Oxford graduate. His speech
turned mainly on the idea that the mater-
i a l satisfactions which could be exper-
ienced on Earth were quite adequate,
without Slaving to depart to other planets
in order to find new ones. He support-
ed this view by exhibiting brightly
coloured brochures advertising a cer-
t i n holiday camp, which, he alleged,-'
was one place where these satisfactions
might be obtained. He was opposed by
Mr. L.J. Carter, the Secretary of the
B r i t i s h Interplanetary Society, who,
with obvious sincerity, described the
new vistas which would be opened to
Kan by the conquest of Space, the
opportunites f o r s c i e n t i f i c discov-
ery, and the solution of Earth's pop-
ulation problems. Mr. Jannan spoke
third, with fiery eloauenoe, but a
shortage of matter. He mentioned
the legal problems which would arise
from the disputed ownership of Space*
and asked the House what i t was that led
men to travel i n Space when they knew
they would be stepping out of their
front doors into ....nothing. Mr.
Finch, speaking fourth, spent too
much time discussing Mr. Jarman and h i s
speech, He then paid verbal homage
to those twin oratorical gods, the
s p i r i t s of Adventure and of S c i e n t i f i c
Discovery.
Speeches from the floor were few
i n number, and lacking i n vigour. Mr.
Loome made the day's best point against
the motion, when he said that too much
time and money were being devoted to the
Space race, which could more profitably
be used for the r e l i e f of the under-
nourished peoples of the world.
7ne House divided, Siid the motion
was rejected by 6^. voter to 42 with 6
abstentions.
