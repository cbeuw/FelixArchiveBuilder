The Imperial College debating
team came away from the f i n a l 3
of the U.L.U. debating contest on
Monday, March 9th at the Beveridge H a l l
as holders of the Debating Challenge
Cup f o r the f i r s t time ever.
15 minutes before the debate start-
ed the Captain of the Imperial team won
the toss and decided that Imperial
should propose. Then the sealed envel-
ope containing a motion decided upon by
the President and Secretary of U.L.U.
debates was opened and the motion read
out by the captain of the team from
Richmond College, the other f i n a l i s t s .
The motion was: "That Commercial
enterprises are a greater danger to the
l i b e r t y of the individual than p o l i t i -
cal parties*"
lies A l l e n opened the debate f o r
I.C., outlining the I.C. case, and
mentioning the various ways i n which
commercial enterprise limited indiv-
idual freedom. John Loome who sec-
onded for I.C. attacked modern methods
of advertising and some other dubious
aspects of modern commerce.
The f i r s t Richmond speaker dwelt
at great length on the weaknesses of a
two party system. The second Richmond
speaker made several good points but
was not very tidy i n his presentation.
Third speakers on both sides were
whimsical. Peter Jarman f o r I.C. was
witty i n a manner relevant to the mot-
ion, but the Richmond speaker, undoubt-
edly an excellent comedian i n the A l
Read vein,was largely off the point.
Bo. .xnch speaking 4th for I.C.
made out that i t was almost a contra-
diction i n terms to speak of a p o l -
i t i c a l party l i m i t i n g freedom. His
opposite number from Richmond pro-
duced a magnificent piece of oratory
marred only by the occasional out-
standing i l l o g i c a l i t y .
John Loome's summing up for I.C.
was unquestionably stronger than the
Richmond effort.
The verdict was decided by a
panel of 3 independant judges.
Les Allen had to leave the debate
before the end to be back i n time to
play the lead i n the Taming of the
Shrew.

JOHN BRUGES SCORING THE ONLY I.C. TRY.
J O L O S E S R U G B Y F I N A L T O K I N G S
At Motspur Park l a s t Saturday I.C,
relinquished t h e i r grasp on the U.L.
Rugger Cup with a rather disappointing
display of Cup Rugby. Right from the
beginning of the game when I.C. seemed
unable to do anything r i g h t , i t looked
as though Kings were a better team.
After 10 minutes of ragged play during
which I.C. had plenty of b a l l , a pen-
a l t y from a lineout infringement on
our 25 gave Kings a 3 point lead..
Two minutes l a t e r Ted Wright, openside
wing forward, was helped off the f i e l d
with what turned out to be^a dislocated
shoulder.
Play now swung more f r e -
quently into I.C.'s 25, although the
I.C. scrum s t i l l got t h e i r 3hare of the
b a l l . Two missed penalties from within
the I.C. 25 should have heralded the
I.C. r e t a l i a t i o n but i t was not to be.
Later I.C. i n turn missed two penalties
and although they got a f a i r share of
the b a l l , inconclusive play allowed the
game to range from one end ^o'the other.
In the second naif Kings kicked off
with the wind and while play was s t i l l
i n our 25, Jones i n the Kings centre
dropped a goal from i n front of the
posts making the soore 6-0. When play
again returned to our l i n e , an attempt
at a pushover t r y resulted i n a loose
b a l l a foot from the l i n e and a Kings
forward scooped i t over for three more
points the conversion bringing the
Kings lead to 11-0. Having nothing
to lose I.C. began to t r y to open the
game up and f a r the last 15 minutes
played t h e i r best rugby of the game,
keeping Kings i n t h e i r own 25. A out
baok into the scrum by Flyhalf Hearn
with the subsequent pass to Bregazsi
and to Bridges resulted i n the l a t t e r
scoring. The conversion h i t the post
leaving the score at 11-3 where i t
remained to the end of the game i n spite
of I.C. pressure.
Of the game as a whole, I.C. got off
to a very bad start and only recovered
i n the l a s t 20 minutes. Kings were a
very good team and proved very fast i n
the forwards although the I.C. scrum were
s t i l l on equal terms at the end. Ted
Wright's injury l e f t Kings with a spare
man to b o t t l e up the I.C. outsides,
whose movement was already handicapped
by a certain lack of understanding at
halfback and i t i s d i f f i c u l t to say
what the result would have been had he
not had t o leave the f i e l d .
The flow of the game was s p o i l t
completely by long and apparently
unnecessary periods of injury time on
behalf of the King3 backs. I.C., with
the exception of wings Milward and Buet,
did not show t h e i r be*t, although the
forwards fought to t Â« b i t t e r end. The
supporters- who came to cheer must have
been as disappointed as the team but
we oan only thank them and say that we
w i l l do better next year.
Three more games remain to be
played t h i s season, against Penzance,
Falmouth and .St. Ives on 23rd, 24th
and 25th March i n Cornwall, and we hope
that any I.C. men i n the neighbourhood
w i l l come along and watch.
