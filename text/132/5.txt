NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT
Dear S i r ,
I tnank you f o r your attention bo
.uy l e t t e r printed i n the last edition
of F e l i x . In reply to your comments
I would make the following points:
a) The S.C.C. s i t s as infrequently as
i t conveniently can: last term i t sat
twice and so f a r this term i t has sat
once.
b) The Nuclear Disarmament Comm-
i t t e e d i d not apply f o r membership
of S.C.C. because preliminary prob-
Lem3 made i t obvious that i t would
be rejected immediately. Thi3 was
stated by several Union and S.C.C.
o f f i o ^ a l s when such an application
was contemplated. Not only d i d
they made i t obvious i n their words
but also i n their actions, as you
yourself must remember.
As you seem t o suggest that a l l
the Nuclear Disarmament Committee has
to do t o be accepted by S.C.C. i s t o
apply , this i s axaotly what i s t o
be done. However, i t has been decid-
ed to broaden the scope of such a s c i
i e t y to include every aspect of the
struggle for World Peace and the Soc-
w i l l therefore have the t i t l e of
'Peace Union.' In t h i s way we hope
to embrace a l l shades of opinion i n
I.C. on the subject of World peace
and co-operation.
The constitution w i l l be on the
Union board by 9th March and the
signatures w i l l follow immediately.
The rest w i l l be up t o the S.C.C. and
Union Executive.
Yours sincerely,
David Finney.
COMMENT
Dear S i r ,
I feel I cannot let David Finney's
l e t t e r to go without comment. Is there
a genuine need for a Peace Union i n this
College? We have a long-established
International Relations Club which sure-
l y i s the body f o r discussion of prob-
lems which surround the aspects of "the
struggle for World Peace."
The wording of the l e t t e r and the
use of phrases such as Struggle for
World Peace, Peace Union, World Peace
and Co-operation strongly suggest a
Communist inspired organisation. That
every member of the Union i s e n t i t l e d to
hra own views i s undeniable and i f there
are «nougn people with similar interests
or views they should be allowed to form
a society. However there i s a Marxist
sub-group of the L i t and Deb Society.
I f the proposed Peace Union i s Communist
then that i s i t s place.
Any movement fighting f o r world
peace i f i t i s to have a moral force
must either contain a l l shades of p o l -
i t i c a l opinion or be a p o l i t i c a l , that
is to say argue from a humanistic
point of view. The United Nations
Students Association, containing a l l
shades of opinion, i s such a body on
a national soale. U.N.3.A. not only
talks about world problems but i t
takes part i n practical solutions o f
some. I t participates i n work camps
where volunteers help to build houses
for refugees, the products o f war and
world unrest. U.NV3.A. endeavours to
understand and help others to under-
stand the U.N., a body dedicated to
peace which however i s only as strong
as i t s members allow i t to be. The
International Relations Club i s a f f i l -
iated to U.N.3.A. and therefore i t
seems proper that any discussion suoh
as David Finney envisages should be
within the International Relations Club.
Yours sincerely,
P. PORGESS.
DR.ZHIVAGO.
Boris Pasternak's book l
*Dr Zhivago", i s
not a good hovel when' compared with those
bf Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky: this said
M.G. Kullman M.A. from the Royal College
of Art, is shown by the lack of continuous
plot, the strange coincidences which are
not a consequence of events, and the
unexplained appearance and disappearance
of people other than Zhivago himself.
GENERAL STUDIES
Herein lies the reason for this book
being condemned as counter-revolutionary
- i t ie contrary to political supriority.
It is not aotively opposed to the revolu-
tion; i t does not need to be, as to have
doubts is worse than being in opposition,
and being outside the normal values on
whioh i t may be judged, i t must therefore
be wrong.
However, overlooking this point, the
book pre-supposes some previous knowle-
dge of the Russian Revolution (as compa-
red with "War. and -Peace", in whioh a l l
required history is given), and against
this i t makes sense, i t does not give
the*overall pioture, but rather the ob-
verse human story of one man's suffering
and the cost of the revolution, hence a
ohaotic form of writing has been used to
describe an unstable social structure in
a ohaotio situation - a good reason for
the many omissions.
Zhivago is not a good hero; he is
not an aotive agent for the good or bad,
and his l i f e i s epitomised by passivity.
He stands for values whioh are ignored
by the revolution - ordinary values of
love and poetry on the one hand, and of
keeping his family alive on the other -
values whioh are both above and below
those of the revolution itself. He i s
accused of being a coward, for running
away to write poetry, beoause he did no
agree that a l l should be saorifio#4 tot
the revolution.
It is very probable that "Dr Zhiva-
go" is close to an autobiography; the
image of rotting and wasted crops makes
Zhivago doubt the value of the revolution
and in 1928 be dies beoause he has survi-
ved intc-a sooiety whioh has no room for
him, of a disease for whioh no-one has
any time either - oertainly no hero of
pacifism. Although Pasternak i s s t i l l
slive i t may be that part of him that
died with Zhivago in1928. This adds posi-
tive value-to the work, in the suggest-
ion of the meaning of l i f e and immorta-
l i t y : there are things which we do whioh
are immortal, by whioh we remain in the
world through the effects of what we
have done, wherea" the body which did
them i s mortal. And further, there is
the possibility of living in the future
suggested at the end of the book:-
"To the two aging friends sitting
by the window i t seemed that this freedom
of the spirit was there, that on that ve
very evening the future had become almost
tangible i n the streets below, and that
they had themselves -entered that future
and would, from now on, be part of i t . "
MR. ICWA.
Moral integrity, sense of humour,
air of mystery, -virtue, and v i r i l i t y ;
these are the requirements of Mr.
I.C.W.A. Or so the young ladies were
Informed wnen they met on March 5th to
elect their -pm-up boy of 1959".
Twenty-six members assembled in
the lounge and as each nominee was i n -
troduced his superior,qualities, were
outlined in a short speech by his
proposer. In all eight gentlemen
were present and i t was painfully evid-
ent that there was a majority from the
R.S.M. and, in particular, the mining
geology department. In faot, the Pres
ident, Miss T i l dan-Smith announced her
conclusion that the Mines must indeed
be a "hot-bed of iniquity".
The Victims varied from Brian
Young, "the man with savoir f aire", and
exoellently proposed by John Coles, to
George Manson who wore his k i l t for
the occasion and sought leave from the
President to remain standing throughout.
The comic aot was provided by Trevor
Soarrat who presented Miss Tilden-
Smith with a brush of doubtful use, a
Jnion Jack, and a 4-week old pie baked
by himself. However, this subtle
bribery was in vain for Tony Ewart, a
P.G. Mining Geologist, was finally
elected Mr. I.C.W.A.
Tony, or Tub, as he is affection-
ately known by the fair sex, was propo-
sed by Cleopatra; introducing him thus:
"we are not looking for a t a l l , dark,
handsome Romeo, but someone who has
given his servioes to I.C.W.A.• someone
who i s shy and modest". They could
not have chosen better for i t is his own
modesty which has caused him to heavily
censor this account of the proceedings.
However, apart from the favourable
publioity which will be so helpful in
his oareer, the rewards of this post are
many. They include feeding the gold-
fish at weekends, and being present on
the I.C.W.A. photographs and on their
theatre visits. In addition, our
'beau' was presented with a sash of
honour (significantly made 6 inches too
short) and a "constant companion" -
a black pointed tailor's model. His
comment on receiving the latter was
"just what I have always wanted". How
true!!!
Finally, I hope that Tony's year
of office is a happy one. . It should be
far there is plenty of latent talent -
in faot it's a l l latent! And now that
he has been elected, what of the future?
I implore you ladies. Make the most of
him.
Nelson.
