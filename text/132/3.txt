Compared with the majority of
Shakespeare's plays, "The Shrew" leaves
much t o he desired: the dialogue shows
a 'prentice grasp of poetry, although
Petruohio's "mother-wit" on f i r s t meet-
ing with Katherina gives a glimpse o f
Shakespeare's control of words, the plot
i s a patohwork of stories with many
loose ends - characters meet i n the
street, having come from distant lands,
and happen to know each other1
s fathers:
Petruchio has a half-hour's courtship
and disappears u n t i l the wedding day
without explanation: and Bianca's
woers do not seem concerned i n attract-
ing her love.
The main plot gives r i s e to much
shouting and abuse from Petruchio to
everyone he meets, but he i s very care-
f u l not to say anything to his wife
that, more than any deed, may cause her
permanent hurt: he tames her with
incredible severity by depriving her
of luxuries, and by t i n t i n g a l l h i s
remarks with cutting irony. As to the
object of h i s ravings, under the stub-
born and rebellious mask of a b i t i n g
tongue, Katherina can be seen to be
marriageable, and at the end (for a
modern audience) embarrassingly f a i t h -
f u l to her husband: on several occas-
ions she shows herself w i l l i n g to submi
to h i s stupid wtiims, such as h i s asser-
tion that the sun was the moon.
The character of Bianca i s more
d i f f i c u l t to analyse, for she does not
act as the sweet and innocent young _
woman that Hortensio would have us b e l -
ieve : her deceit of him i n preference
for the unknown Lucentic, i n the guise
of a tutor, i s shameful by any standards,
and remains unexplained and unconvincing
i n the plot. Not that Bianca i s an
important part: but she i s the focus
of a l l the sub-plots except the In-
duction, and should therefore be strong
enough to hold them together.
However, leaving aside a l l the
t e c h n i c a l i t i e s , there i s enough com-
edy and p l a u s i b i l i t y i n the story t o
be good entertainment. So i t was with
l a s t week's production by the I.C.
Dramatic Society. The leads were
played with considerable iiolish and
gusto, s u f f i c i e n t to Overcome the
weaknesses of the plot and of the other
actors.
Leslie A l l e n gave an excellent
performance as Petruchio: he raved
at tiie servants, treated his wife as
no wife should be treated, yet s t i l l
made himself l i k e d by the audience.
Judith Korhbluth, as Katherine, was
also very good: her acting was most
moving and conveyed the change i n
character well..
Grumio, servant to Petruchio,
was played by Peter Korgan he has
3hown a great improvement i n the
l a s t few productions, and this was his
best yet - he r e a l l y made us feel
c o l d whoa he entered Petruchio's house
shivering.
A quick resume' of seme of the
others: Terry Wright as Baptists
Minola (Katherina's father] was w e l l
cast: Ken Packer gave a very f a i r
interpretation of Gremio (suitor
t o Bianca), but was lacking i n variety
and a l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t to hear: Dick
Wright, as Hortensio, improved as
itie play proceeded, but just f a i l e d to
EES ALLEN JUDITH KORNBLUTH
convince: Desmond Turner (Lucentio)
was just s u f f i c i e n t l y appealing to
make himself undisputed suitor to
Bianca: and Tris Dickinson, as Bianca
' was unfortunate i n h::.vi.i^; a rather i n -
decisive part to play.
But, as an example that a small
part can be portrayed :
-
.
s w e l l as. i main
one, Victor Soyoe as the t a i l o r l a .veil
worth mentioni:'.™: he was on stage for
only a few minutes, and said only a
, few words, but he gave the part a r e a l -
i t y which was missing i n sane of the
others.
The scenery for t h i s production was
quite reasonable, but was poorly l i t :
i t had no feeling of depth, the l i g h t -
ing with very few f i l t e r s was too harsh,
and on too many occasions were actors
talking i n the dark, Why was more use
not made of the footlights?
F i n a l l y , i t i s not good for con-
t i n u i t y to have long pauses with an
empty stage, even on the f i r s t night:
but, taken as a whole, "The Shrew"
provided an enjoyable evening, with
thanks to the producer Colin Dixon.

CONTINUED FROM PACE 1
The Imperial team are pleased
about the victory for several reasons.
F i r s t l y , Richmond are a college of
theologians, who might be said to be
professional speakers, and they have
won the contest for the last three
years. Secondly, i t shows that
Imperial i s not necessarily a college
of over specialised s c i e n t i f i c morons,
capable of winning nothing except on a
sports f i e l d . Thirdly, the road to
the finals was not easy: I.C. had to
meet Guy's, where there was a very
good team, L.S.S., where one would ex-
pect to find good speakers, and B i r k -
beck who last year won the national
contest.
QJUo-pattui Meedle
Spring i s the time when a
young man's fancy turns to thoughts of
love, (though ' t i s said i t i s also the
time when a young man's fanoy turns t o
what most of the g i r l s have been think-
ing of the whole winter). Can this
bo the reason f o r the mode of behaviour
of the men during the last few weeks?
Have some bright young things caught
their eyes? Or i s i t the a n t i c i -
pation of the end of term and the
beginning of good wholesome oooking
that has brought about this miraculous
change? No. These are not sufficient
reasons, the most satisfaotor one hav-
ing been discovered only after much i n -
vestigation into the a c t i v i t i e s of the
a f f l i c t e d ones.
The transformation began with the
undisguising of an t-Bawoutlve Member of
one of the Constituent Colleges. A f t e r
having reoeived no satisfactory explana-
tion f o r t h i s hasty step, h i s acquain-
tances sought to find a solution*
Slowly i t dawned on them, but they ware
loath to part with their "knowledge. To
t e l l a l l would be to lose a l l . A l i t t l e
competition i s a good thing but too
muoh i s disarming. These knowledgeable
fellows Daft off their untidy clothes j
and took on an immaculate appearance.'
But this was not the only noticeable
change; manners showed an improvement
beyond imagination. The ladies no
longer had the experience of having
a heavy door swung i n their faces; i n
faot the door was now opened for them
and closed to behind them. Their '
*
language was moderated and no more
excuses had to be made i n female com-
pany. General behaviour towards a,
lady was particularly pleasing though
this oourtesy was limited to the mem-
bers of I.C.W.A. Perhaps'it was a
form of canvassing by prospective can-
didates for the t i t l e of Mr. I.C.W.A.
These tactics were employed with one'
aim i n view, namely that of ^procuring
an i n v i t a t i o n to the I.C.W.A. Formal
Dinner and Danoe on the last Friday o f
term.^ There are but'few lucky ones and
many downhearted rejected foresaken men.
The strong competition for invitations
t h i s year has lead many of the women
to wonder whether the Guest Speaker,
Eveljia-Home, i s not fact the main
attraction* .

C H O I R C O N C E R T
Last Wednesday the Imperial College
Choir gave a s p i r i t e d rendering of
Mozart's Mass i n C miner. This work,
which was l e f t incomplete by the com-
poser at his death, has had the missing .
parts sup-lied from NiOaart's other
church music.
The choir, ably supported by the
harvey P h i l l i p s Orchestra, was. conducted
by Dr. E r i c Brown of the C i v i l Engin-
eering Department. The soloists, from
the Opera School, were i n general good,
although the f i r s t soprano had the un-
fortunate f a i l i n g of pitch f l u t t e r on
sustained notes. This fault, which
proved distressing at times to the aud-
ience, should not be allowed to detract
from the overal.- high standard of the
production. In particular•the Bene-
dictus was worthy of special hotee
As g rousing introduction to the
programme we heard Vaugiian-V/illiams
Be.iidicite. This work, composed i n
the 1930s i s a f i t t i n g tribute to the-
memory ofthis great English composer.
