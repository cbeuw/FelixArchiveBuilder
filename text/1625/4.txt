Cambridge to introduce new admission test

C
ambridge university is
set to introduce new
admissions tests for every
subject to make up for
changes to the qualification system
that will see AS Levels no longer
count towards A Level results.
This change has been in
consideration since last year, when
the government first announced
plans to change how A Levels
worked.Certain AS Levels will now
be uncoupled from the full A Level
qualification. Schools can choose to
run AS Levels alongside teaching
for A Levels, but it is predicted
that many will do away with AS to
concentrate on teaching the full two
year qualification.
Cambridge has long been against
the reforms. In November 2014, the
university wrote to schools and sixth
forms in England asking them not
do away with AS Levels, since they
are used by admissions tutors to
predict how well a student will do.
Interestingly, the correlation is not
seen when predicting outcomes for
a Maths qualification.
The assessments will be unique
to each subject, with some being
sat before interviews in November
on the same day as similar tests for
Oxford, and others with shorter
tests conducted at the interview.
The tests will be taken by
students applying for 2017 entry, so
applicants sending off their UCAS
forms this September will have to
take the tests to be considered for
interview.
Cambridge University’s new
Director of Admissions across
colleges said that this move was
in response to teacher and student
feedback, as well as to “maintain
the effectiveness and fairness of our
admissions system”.
Peter Lampl of the Sutton Trust,
a charity addressing educational
disadvantage, has said any
simplication of the process of
applying to Cambridge is a good
thing, but warned that: “tests could
present a disadvantage for low-and
middle-income students as there is
a thriving market in private tuition
for the extra admissions tests.”

“...and its willingness to work with
the RAG committee to make sure
this year’s RAG Week is a success.”
The union has told the Raising
and Giving society that they can
distribute a revised version of the
magazine only if the offending page
is replaced with an advert for the
union’s own upcoming elections.
The union has also offered to
reprint it, which would allow the
new magazine to be distributed by
Monday. RAG are likely to take
them up on this offer,having already
lost several days of promotion for
next week’s events.
RAG told FELIX: “Every year
RAG issues it’s RAG Mag, which
is designed to be a funny but
controversial magazine which
promotes our great RAG Events”.
“In the past it’s made fun of
natural disasters and human
tragedies, this year the call was
made to print a satirical piece about
Lucinda, as such the union feels
that this overstepped the mark, and
as such the union made the call to
stop distribution of RAG Mags
across campus”.
“This is disappointing as it’s one
of our key methods of publicity.The
union have since replied that they
are willing to pay the cost to reprint
the magazines, under the condition
that the offending article is replaced
by a leadership election ad.”
RAG mags have a history of
causing controversy, with several
in Imperial’s history being banned
for bad taste, racism and to avoid
damaging the reputation of the
college. In 1987, the president
of CGCU said that year’s RAG
mag ban was necessary to prevent
Imperial becoming “more renowned
for it’s obscenities than its
excellence”.
This year RAG are raising money
for Great Ormond Street Hospital,
the British Refugee Council
and Porridge and Rice, a charity
providing food and educational
resources for children in a slum in
Nairobi.

“The dialogue [with college] is
such that there can be no more
negatives surrounding alcohol
without risking the SU and our
separate clubs and societies”.
In the eyes of the law, Imperial
only has one student union, and
ICSMSU is a constituent union
of ICU. However, at the moment,
ICSMSUdoeshavesomeautonomy,
with its own separate clubs,societies
and sports teams and a sabbatical
president paid for by the faculty.
Some concern also seems to
surround what a negative medics
storycoulddofortheplightofJunior
Doctors. Another 24 hour strike is
planned for Wednesday the 10th
of
February, and it’s feared that what
would normally be an innocuous
photo of a student drinking in
scrubs, this week especially, could
damage the contract campaign.
After The Sun’s desperate story
on “Moet Medics”, when photos
surfaced of members of the BMA’s
junior doctor committee drinking
and on holiday, the medical school
is under pressure to make sure
students aren’t photographed in
compromising ways over the week.
The Circle Line pub crawl caused
a stir back in 2013, when Imperial
medics were accused of damaging
property. All Imperial students were
temporarily banned from the bar
Medic pub crawl becomes day of volunteering
over a weekend as a result.
Medic RAG week usually involves
the RAG invasion, where medical
students in fancy dress complete
challenges and collect money
around central London, and RAG
Dash, where students hitchhike
across the country before travelling
to a European destination, which,
this year, is Paris.
