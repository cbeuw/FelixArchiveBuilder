ello there! Here we
are again – it’s pre-
election time. Varsity is
just a sparkle in Sport
Imperial’s eye, and campaigning
is still far from beginning. If the
Leadership Elections were the US
Presidential Elections, we’d all be in
Iowa right now. Sort of.
Undoubtedly, some people have
been thinking about running for
quite a while now, and they’ve been
planning kitch ways to nab votes
since Christmas. That doesn’t mean
you, who occasionally slams a pint
down at the union exclaiming that
you could really change this place if
you were given the chance,don’t still
have a fighting chance of winning.
Nobody’s paying me to say
this (although I am being paid,
indirectly, to say something) but
you should probably consider
running.This sounds ridiculous, but
even if your gut feeling is that you
shouldn’t really do it – that might
mean you’re the best person for the
job. Although we get accused of it
all the time, us sabbs (cue the tiny
violins) aren’t really in it for the CV.

Yes, we could be doing worse things
on a gap yah – Goldman doesn’t
want to hear about a ski season or
six month stint writing poetry on a
barge in Berlin – but there are also
offers that every year tempt some of
the best people for the jobs away to
more exotic pursuits.
I would argue that this pursuit is
a noble one, where yes, you really
do have a frighteningly big impact
and influence. And if you do win,
people will remind you of that
throughout your tenure (which I
find odd, because if you tell me I’m
big and powerful that’s not going
to shame me into doing what you
want,I’m going to think I’m the shit
and probably disregard what you’re
saying).
If you don’t win? Well, no one
will care except you. You’ll have met
more people campaigning than you
did in Freshers Week, and literally
no one will remember you cried in
Metric afterwards when everyone
comes back after the summer. Not
even you. You will genuinely forget.
Until the person who trumped you
does something terrible and you
decide to run again the next year.
Often the votes are very close.
Working your arse off for a week
talking to people in the library could
bag you a job. Initially approaching
people is awful, but you’ll talk to so
many students who just don’t want
to know that eventually you’ll reach a
higher state of consciousness where,
genuinely, you are no longer able to
experience social awkwardness, and
that’s a life skill.

In response to Issue 1623
A question of journalistic integrity
- are we satisfied?
When a news outlet publishes
its findings every week, it has the
opportunity to highlight the most
important issues facing its readers.
The FELIX stands in a privileged
position,with a readership spanning
some of the brightest young minds
of this generation. It has, in my
opinion, the duty to inform its
readers of the most relevant things
happening at the College, locally
and nationally, that affect us as
students.
When the editor in chief elected
to run a front page spread of a club’s
antics on a road trip, rather than
place real news such as the axing of
maintenance grants at the front, it
belittled the integrity of journalism
at this institution. It revealed that
shaming our colleagues for their
actions at a social event was more
newsworthy than the government’s
recently imposed changes on
student finance, changes that will
tack on £14,000 or more to the Good grief, is that the Daily Mail?
already staggering debt that one
accrues to study here.
This was excused in the ‘a word
from the editor’ section with lines
such as ‘I love medics in all their
forms’ and ‘one of my best friends
is a medic.’ For the more attuned,
you’ll notice these lines fit the same
formula used by any bigot to address
their bias since time immemorial.
Replace medic with any minority
group and read it back to yourself.
This was a very poor choice of words
which reinforces the perception of a
divide between ICSM and IC.
I expected more from FELIX.
It should be a paragon of good
journalism that informs us, not an
outlet to spread gossip at the expense
of our fellow students. There is a
place for entertainment and drama,
but unless you’re the Daily Mail, it
is not the front page. In the words
of the editor, please deliver ‘high
quality content for millennials.’
Dan (via email)
Gee, I do love fan mail! For the
more attuned of you who read the
whole cover (right), you'll have
noticed that the maintenance
grants news story was also there. It
is important, so we covered it.
I take offence at calling this well-
researched story "gossip", Daniel!
We contacted multiple sources,
including the coach company, the
med school, students on the trip,
the Dover police and P&O ferries
to corroborate stories, and establish
the facts. We didn't sensationalise.
As for my Editorial – sweet of you
to read it by the way – it hurts most
of all that you didn't get my jokes.
Of course racists say "I can't be
racist because I have black friends",
Dan. Some people can't be helped.
Entertainment, news, whatever,
we're always going to disagree on
what should go on the cover, but
what I had that week was a factual
account of what many agreed was a
newsworthy, if unfortunate, failure
of a trip.
Do continue to read my editorials,
but please do mind the sarcasm.

FRIDAY 22nd

L
ast week’s ICSM Boat
club’s annual trip to
Belgium ended before it
really even began – at the
ferry port in Dover.
Current medics and alumni were
prevented by P&O ferry staff from
boarding the boat which would have
taken them to mainland Europe, as
they were too drunk.
The students tried to board the
4:50am ferry from Dover to Calais
but were “drunk and disorderly”
according to port staff. P&O ferries
took the decision not to allow the
students to travel when they were
scheduled to.
In an email, sent as the students
were heading back to London
having been turned away, the club’s
captain told members that “[P&O]
were willing for us to be allowed on
after a 2-3 hour wait. Unfortunately,
the coach drivers were unwilling
to co-operate, hence are currently
driving us back to London”.
The trip from Hammersmith
to Dover had not been without
issue. The coach company’s depot
manager was first contacted by
the driver at 3:30am over the
students’ behaviour. The coach left
Hammersmith as scheduled at a
quarter past midnight on Saturday.
The coach company alleges that
some students caused damage at
Maidstone service station, which
P&O ferries confirmed. The
boat club denies that there were
any complaints made during the
planned stop in Maidstone.
The boat club was told by P&O
that they could take a slightly later
ferry, but as the coach driver was

getting close to his legal driving
limit time, this would be impossible.
The Dover port police were called,
to help the coach get out of the
one way system before the group
were driven back to Hammersmith.
Upon returning, the group tried to
book another coach in an attempt
to save the short weekend trip, but
could not.
Drinking was heavy on the trip,
with some rowers reportedly having
port bottles strapped to their arms,
that they weren’t allowed to remove
until the bottles were finished.
The trip,which cost £80 per ticket,
involved two coaches and 100
students, who each pay £70 per year
for club membership.
Some students had previously
arranged to fly or take the train to
Leuven instead. These members got
to their destination without a hitch.
This news comes after last year’s
shenanigans on the same club’s
annual Leuven trip, when a coach
window was smashed on the way
to Dover. Although the person
responsible was an alumni student,
the whole club was suspended
during Imperial College Union’s
investigation.
The ICSM President and boat
club declined to comment on this
year’s incident. The tweet printed
here suggests the club has not been
issued with a ban. A representative
of Imperial College Union told us
they “had been informed and are
investigating”.
