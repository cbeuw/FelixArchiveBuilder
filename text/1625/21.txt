T
he year of virtual reality
is finally upon us.
This week, the FELIX
team tried Gear VR,
Samsung’s mobile virtual reality
headset.
It’s not as powerful as competitors
like Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive,
but it’s a decent introduction to VR
for the unacquainted.

I tried a few different things.
Personally theBluVR (an immersive
ocean experience) resonated with
me the most. As an ocean lover and
free diver, the app really managed to
replicate the freediving experience
and I felt that it really gave me the
opportunity to do a couple of my
dream dives (alas only virtually). As
a medium it’s really exciting to see
VR being developed and tech such
as Gear VR make it accessible to
everyone.

Ever wished you could press your
nose to Gauguin’s masterpieces
without being hauled off by gallery
security? Well if you don’t mind
being roundly mocked by everyone
surrounding you IRL and the nausea
inducing experience of walking
places using head movements, you
can do just that. My highlight? The
disconcerting effect of being taller
than you actually are. So this is
what the world looks like for people
whose bones didn’t fuse freakishly
early. Technical issues (my own)
aside, this is a weirdly addictive
experience: you know something is
worth it when the headset literally
has to be snatched off your face.

A little uncomfortable and some
kinks to iron out but ultimately
something fun, creative and damn
enjoyable.
Fred Fyles, Film Editor
All new technological advances
bring with them the fear that current
forms of art will go out of date or
become extinct; upon seeing early
examples of the daguerreotype, Paul
Delaroche exclaimed that “painting
is dead”. I have little such fear for

in-Chief
The general experience was
headache inducing, but Lands End
was cool. I don’t think it’s going
to catch on in a very big way. But

Until recently, I saw virtual reality
as part of an elusive future – one that
was particularly out of reach for the
majority of society.Technologies like
Gear VR and Google Cardboard
mean anyone (with the right sort
of smartphone) can access one of
the most promising new forms of
media.There are problems with VR,
A weirdly

experience
It will
remain
nothing
other than
a gimmick
the impact VR will have on film.
While the technological advances
are interesting, the films on offer
were not; I believe that it will remain
nothing other than a gimmick. We
will continue to watch our films in
the dark,looking straight ahead,just
as nature intended.
If folks
start
doing this
on the
bus their
stuff will get
stolen
maybe I’ll look stupid in ten years
time like when we quote people who
said the internet was never going to
catch on. If folks start doing this on
the bus their stuff will get stolen.
One reality
is not
enough
especially if you suffer from motion
sickness, but my small glimpse of
another reality has me excited for
the further advancements we will
see in the next few years.One reality
is not enough, and the games and
other experiences I’ve played so far
are incredibly immersive and offer
interesting, and innovative, new
ways of interaction.
F
or a gaming device to truly
succeed it needs a great
launch title. Land’s End,
a virtual reality puzzle
adventure from the creators of
Monument Valley, is the game that
every owner of the device must play.
Developers Ustwo truly understand
the power of the new medium and
where it works best,and they’ve used
that knowledge to create something
that feels completely new.
Set over five short chapters and
distinct environments, players
must help awaken an ancient
civilisation. Those who have played
Thatgamecompany’s (yes, that’s
actually their name) Journey will
notice the obvious visual and
thematic similarities. The game’s
title has many obvious meanings,
but one of it’s most literal is the way
it frequently places you at the edge
of a cliff, allowing you to peer down
into the sea (or abyss) below.
To move around the environment,
the game uses head tracking. You
look at a place on the screen and the
camera moves.Ustwo have got right
what many other developers have
got wrong – physical controllers
really break the immersion of
virtual reality, so why not do away
with them? The device’s head
tracking ability also gives you
the ability to look at objects and
move them with your mind; you’ll
have to do this often to help you
solve environmental, and more

traditional, puzzles. For an hour or
so I really felt like I had the power
of telekinesis.
The game also plays with
perspective as part of the puzzle
solving gameplay. Unfortunately,
this isn’t used enough which feels
like an oversight for a game that
makes the most of VR.
Land’s End might look simple in
comparison to VR titles on Oculus
Rift and the HTC Vive (which is
mainly a technical limitation), but
it’s stylised, cell-shaded graphics
are one of its best features. Dreamy
colour palettes and spectacular
lighting illuminate environments
ranging from small cave interiors to
massive collections of islands.
Sometimes you’ll come at these
environments from above, slowly
descending into the depths below.
At other times,you leave a cave only
to be blinded by sunlight. The most
breathtaking moments are when
you soar above the landscape (and
this happens a lot); you get a real
sense of scale which can only be
achieved with stereoscopic virtual
reality. Unfortunately, this often
leads to motion sickness, although I
haven’t thrown up yet.
Land’s End, although short, leaves
a mighty impression. It’s the first
truly great mobile VR experience.
