Lions trump Immortals

L
ast Sunday the Immortals
faced the top team of the
Southern Premiership
league, the Birmingham
Lions. The Immortals knew that
with such a strong team like the
Lions, they had to come out firing.
The Immortals did just that and
despite putting up a phenomenal
fight the Lions had the edge towards
the end of the game and came out
victorious with a score of 6-20.
The Immortals started the game
by kicking-off and the defensive
team was on. The defense started
out solidly, having given up some
yards, and they were able to
eventually force a fourth down
within the red-zone, which brought
the offensive team on. A punt was
required after a few plays,as the first
drive was unsuccessful. Not so long
afterwards, a run play executed by
Birmingham’s offense was stopped
through fantastic teamwork on
the Immortals side. This resulted
in the ball being stripped and an
ambitious run towards the end-
zone. Unsurprisingly due to the lack
of speed given his injury prone leg,
the ball was re-fumbled within two
yards of his run, a ‘classic linebacker
thing to do’, thankfully, recovered
by an Immortal. After a few plays
on offense, it was fourth and inches,
and instead of a punt, a fantastically
executed rolling maul was
implemented instead, gaining a lot
of yards, going into Birmingham’s
half. The avalanche of Immortals
O was intensified soon after when
newly appointed Quarterback,
Reese Kildem,ran with the ball after
the snap, gaining significant yardage
and earning a first down. This was
backed up by penalties going against
Birmingham’s side, resulting in the
line of scrimmage moving closer
and closer to the end zone.
The start of the second quarter
saw the Immortals getting close
to getting a touchdown against an
extremely strong Birmingham side.
Big man Emanuel ‘Feast Mode’
Olagbaju, sprinted closer to the
end zone, and after a few more
downs, Quarterback Race Korma,
dived bravely getting into the end-
zone. All the hard work in that
drive by the whole offensive team
was rewarded with a much needed
touchdown (two point conversion
was unsuccessful afterwards). Up
against all odds and criticisms,
the Immortals were up 6-0 going
towards half time. Veteran wide-
receiver Noach Ben-Haim then
followed up this miraculous string
of plays with a pad-cracking hit
against Birmingham’s receiver upon
kick-off. The Immortals defense
were on point afterwards, with
the defensive backs shutting down
all pass plays and the front seven
holding off run plays. Birmingham
were unable to redeem any points
ending the half with a score of
6-0. Despite having achieved so
much this game so far, the lack of
numbers on the Immortals side was
an inevitable enemy.The Lions were
able to take advantage of this weak-
point and scored three touchdowns,
one in the third quarter and two in
the fourth (two out of the three one
point conversions were successful),
ending the game with a score of
6-20.
An amazing effort by all the
players! This game’s MVPs are: Jack
“LEFFFFFT” Codrey – for playing
both ways tirelessly and being of
massive help in all plays. ‘Fresh’
Aaron Wright – who despite having
only one week of experience was
able to perform at an amazing level,
notably making a spectacular tackle
against Birmingham’s running back.
‘Confused’ Imraj Singh Sunner –
for stepping up as a line backer and
performing extremely well, flying all
over the pitch. Markus “Mhuuurrr”

with a

needed
touchdown
Mhor – for consistently playing both
ways at a phenomenally intensive
mind-set. Emanuel ‘Fleece mode’
Olagbaju – once again for bulleting
through the lines of defense
destroying anything in his path.
Rhys ‘season-changing’ Kilian – for
his sneaky runs, his bravery and
his unforgettable touchdown. The
team will now face the Kingston
Cougars next Sunday, followed by a
highly anticipated Super Bowl 50 at
Imperial’s very own 568 and Metric!
