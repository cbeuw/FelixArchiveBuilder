Drenched duathletes dominate Gravesend

A
s the first month of 2016
came to a close, eleven
duathletes from Imperial
College London battled
against the elements to achieve an
impressive tally of podium finishes
at the Gravesend Winter Duathlon.
At 8:50am on Sunday 31st
January,
competitors gathered for the pre-
race briefing at the Gravesend
Cyclopark in Kent. The course was
slightly changed due to a “small
lake”that had formed halfway down
the originally intended run course.
The first run was now lengthened
slightly to just over 6km with a
lap around the cycle circuit before
joining the first half section of the
original run route. The second run
was 3.65km and followed the same
route but without the lap of the
cycle circuit. Sandwiched between
the two would be eight laps of the
cycle circuit totalling 20km on the
bike.
However, the total running
distance was unchanged and Matt
Douthwaite was salivating at the
thought of being able to reel in his
competitors with his lengthy strides.
As the rain started to fall, the race
got underway and the field quickly
spread out with Imperial Triathlon’s
Milan Misak leading the way closely
followed by Matt. Katie Slater
took the lead of the women’s race.
Lily Battershill, Anna Lawson and
Nicola Mason clustered together to
form a pursuing pack.
Disaster struck for Milan at
the start of the bike leg as he
struggled to slip his right foot into
a particularly troublesome cycling
shoe that refused to stop spinning.
Matt’s euphoria of taking the lead
was short lived though as the fully
clipped-in power of Milan’s legs was
able to retake the lead within a few
seconds.
By now the constant drizzle had
made the smooth tarmac of the
circuit even slicker. This posed a
greater challenge to the competitors
on a course that could already be
described as ‘quite technical’ with
plenty of bends and sharp corners.
Surprisingly, there were no major
incidences, although Katie did
admit to misjudging a corner and
veering onto the grass for a brief
moment. She kept her composure,
and more importantly her lead. The
pursuing pack had dispersed and she
now had Nicola hot on her heels.
Nearing the end of the bike leg,
Matt’s “runner’s legs” were unable
to hold onto second place and he
was overtaken by a triathlete from
Tunbridge Wells Triathlon Club.
However, Matt’s sneaky tactic of
simply not changing his shoes
between bike and run during
transition enabled him to quickly

regain his position.
Having built up a comfortable
gap ahead of Matt, Milan was
the first male to cross the line in a
time of 1:09:42. Matt joined him
on the podium in second with a
time of 1:12:04. Katie was the first
female to finish in a time of 1:25:09
followed by Nicola (1:26:09) and
Lily (1:28:46) to complete an
Imperial 123.
Elsewhere on the course, Miguel
Pereira, whose muscles apparently
still ached from his impressive
performance at the GO TRI
Velopark Duathlon earlier in
the week, put in another equally
impressive performance to finish
in a time of 1:18:19. Chris Lehrter
finished just ahead of Katie in a time
of 1:24:15 and Marcel Admiraal did
well to come 3rd
in the men’s veteran
category in a time of 1:28:46. Qalif
Razman struggled a little on a bike
which was clearly too small for him,
but his speedy running was able to
make up for it and he finished with
a time of 1:31:51. Anna Lawson
completed her second duathlon in
a decent time of 1:32:55. Sam was
the last Imperial duathlete to cross
the line in a time of 1:37:37 – a
disheartening seven minutes slower
than his performance two years
ago. But he was pleased to have
at least finished the race without
any pain from his long-term shin
splint injury; the road to recovery
continues for the club captain.
