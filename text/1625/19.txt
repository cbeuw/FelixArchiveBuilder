FILM
The top three
Korean films
that aren’t
Oldboy
A
rather weird exchange
of words comes
about every time I
recommend maverick
Korean Director Chan-wook
Park’s 2003 masterpiece Oldboy:
‘Trust me this film is so amazing
and messed up, it will scar you for
life!’ It’s something that has to be
seen to be understood. What is
for sure is that Oldboy represents
just one film in the blossoming
world of modern Korean cinema:
I’m a Cyborg, But That’s
OK (2006)
What a name,eh? I’m a Cyborg...
was the first film Park released
after finishing his ‘Vengeance’
trilogy, of which Oldboy took
centre stage. Here, Su-jeong Lim
gives an electric performance as
Young-goon, a factory worker
who is sent to a mental hospital
for thinking that she is a combat
cyborg. At the institute she meets
several characters ­
– all deranged
or strange – including Park Il-
sun, played by Korean heart-
throb Rain, a man who thinks he
can steal souls.
The Host (2006)
I always considered The Host to
be the first true ‘Blockbuster’ film
to come out of South Korea.Upon
release it sold over 13 million
tickets domestically.Assuming no
repeat viewings that totals 20%
of the South Korean population.
It’s not hard to see why as The
Host is essentially Korea’s answer
to Godzilla – instead featuring a
monster lurking in Seoul’s Han
River.
Memories of Murder
(2003)
Released the same year as
Oldboy, Memories of Murder
is almost every bit a classic,
starring the incredible Kang Ho-
Song as one half of a detective
team tasked to solve a string of
brutal murders in the Gyeonggi
province. With perfect pacing,
deep and engrossing characters
and a mystery plot every bit as
shocking as David Fincher’s
Seven, this film is a must-see.

Documentary corner: Chimpanzee
Ben Collier
Film Writer
O
h a genuine big-budget
nature documentary,"
I thought excitedly.
As a biologist and
lover of all things primate I was
instantly excited to watch this
film upon seeing its name online.
Unfortunately, my excitement
quickly flip-flop’d when I saw the
second part of the title: ‘Disney
nature’. Expectations dropped
considerably. Disney, as a company,
has several connotations which,
whilst fitting for children’s cartoons
and comedies, doesn’t seem to blend
well with the themes and tropes of a
mature nature documentary.
What I was pleasantly surprised
to find out upon finishing the film
however, is that Chimpanzee does
away with a very large proportion,
although not all, of its Disney
baggage.
Chimpanzee is presented as
a story-driven narrative, and
throughout the film we follow a
3-month old chimpanzee called
‘Oscar’. In the opening scenes we
hear of his mother’s death and
see him separated from his troop.
Unfortunately, even once reunited
with his clan none of the other 35
mothers are then prepared to ‘adopt’
him. Just before all hope is lost
however an adult male ‘Freddy’takes
Oscar under his wing.This narrative
is expertly spun throughout and we
are able to learn a lot about the life
of chimps in the Ivory Coast’s Tai
Forest all whilst following the main
protagonist’s journey. For example,
in one short scene where Oscar
observes how to crack open nuts
– Oscar tries desperately to get to
the nuts using logs of wood before
an adult shows him how to instead
use a spiked rock – we not only
gain character development, but are
also informed of primate learning
behaviours.
In what I consider to be the big
‘Act 3 showdown’ of the film there
is a clash between two warring
troops of chimpanzees. One is led
by a battered old alpha-male the
filmmakers called ‘Scar’ and the
other led by Freddy. The pacing and
editing here is absolutely superb,
and as much as I don’t want to
admit it I also found myself more
invested in the outcome of this clash
having followed the main players
throughout the film’s narrative. It is
here where the film shines.
One issue is persistent however:
whilst the looming hand of
Disney is mostly absent from this
experience, Chimpanzee can be,
at times, anthropomorphic to a
fault. The narrator often describes
the chimps activity in an all-too
romantic way. Even the labelling
of the leader of the second clan
as ‘Scar’ is a rather obviously
manipulative move. Selective
editing allows the filmmakers to
spin any narrative they wanted, and
one does often question the reality
of what is presented on screen. As
it stands though Chimpanzee still
serves as an expertly assembled
and executed look into some
very intimate parts of the lives of
young chimps. It is also a lot more
educational than one might assume.
As for recommendations, of course
I would suggest you watch this film
but perhaps bring a younger family
member along with you as they will
absolutely love it.

Hollywood and the DuVernayTest
F
or the second year running,
the Academy Awards has
nominated only Caucasian
actors for the awards,
igniting a powder-keg on social
media, and highlighting the lack
of diversity in the film world. But
not all hope is lost; while actors
like Charlotte Rampling and
Julie Delpy may make misguided
comments on the industry, there are
signs of real change: Cheryl Boone
Isaacs, president of the Academy,
has stated a move towards changes
in the membership policy, which
would hopefully lead to a more
representative group choosing the
winners; Idris Elba picked up two
SAG awards, in a pointedly-diverse
ceremony; and the deliberately-
titled slave rebellion drama Birth
of a Nation has won two of the top
prizes at Sundance.
In an article for The New York
Times, chief film critic Manohla
Dargis has floated the idea for a
‘DuVernay Test,’ one modelled on
the Bechdel Test, and named after
Ava DuVernay,the director of Selma,
whose snub at the Oscars was seen as
a crucial indication of Hollywood’s
problem with minorities. DuVernay
herself has endorsed the idea on
Twitter, although the actual form
of the test is unclear; while the
Bechdel test merely requires there
to be two named women characters
who speak to each other about
something other than a man,
Dargis just stated that the test
would involve: ‘African-Americans
and other minorities having fully
realized lives rather than serve as
scenery in white stories.’
I am sure that there are those who
will – like critics of the Bechdel Test
– argue that such motions are merely
‘painting by numbers,’ and wouldn’t
be in any way representative of
the quality of the film. I would say
that such critics have obstinately
missed the point of such tests: in a
US population that is 51% women
and nearly 40% non-white, we
should expect minority and women
characters to serve as more than
just a backdrop for the exploits of a
(white, straight, male) hero.The test
is not about quality, more about the
representativeness of the industry.
The DuVernay test, as expressed
by Dargis, brings up two key points.
The first is that minority characters
in films have ‘fully realized lives,’
an idea that involves the characters
being named, their thoughts
explored, and their portrayal on-
screen being nuanced. There is the
long-running trope of the black
character being the first to be killed
in a horror movie, of the Asian
character being a maths and science
whiz, and of Middle Eastern
actors inevitably playing a string of
‘terrorist’ roles; but tropes are tropes
for a reason, and they reflect the
lack of fully-developed characters
offered to minority actors. In one
episode of Aziz Ansari’s lauded
Netflix sitcom Master of None,
struggling-actor Dev refuses a role
that would require him to put on
an Indian accent, despite the fact
that he was born and grew up in the
US – it’s a common problem many
minority actors face.
Even in those roles where
minority actors have garnered
acclaim, the range of such roles has
been limited: the first black winner
of an Oscar, Hattie McDaniel, won
for playing a ‘mammy’ stereotype;
the last three black winners of the
Best Supporting Actress Oscar
have won for, respectively, a slave, a
maid, and an abusive mother reliant
on welfare. While Birth of a Nation
does, I am sure, deserve its critical
acclaim, it would be fantastic to see
roles for minority actors that break
out of traditional tropes.
But there is another issue at
hand here that the DuVernay Test
brings up, not equality of outcome,
but equality of opportunity. It is
all well and good getting annoyed
with the Academy, but really what
we should be doing is questioning
and examining the deeper power
structures present in the film
industry. In order to have more
minorities being recognized for
their work, they need to have the
chance of showing off their talent in
the first place, something that does
not seem to be happening within
the current studio system. Often,
executives have given the excuse that
stories about minorities or women
Ava DuVernay (centre) has supported a new test to encourage wholly developed minority characters in films. Photo Credit: AP/Wikimedia/Sundance Selects
DuVernay's
snub at the
Oscars was
indicative of
the whole
problem
You can't
win awards
for roles that
aren't there
simply don’t sell. This is clearly a
lie, as recent releases have proved:
Straight Outta Compton made more
than $200 million, while Star Wars:
The Force Awakens, whose two
protagonists are black and a woman,
became the highest-grossing film
of all time in the US. There is now
no excuse for studio executives to
refuse to fund minority films on the
excuse that it doesn’t represent a safe
investment.
Furthermore, many roles that
may be filled with minorities are
‘whitewashed,’ with Caucasian
actors chosen instead. While we
may want to kid ourselves that
we have left such portrayals like
Mickey Rooney’s grossly-offensive
turn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s in the
past, we only need to look back a
couple of years, to 2013’s The Lone
Ranger in which Johnny Depp plays
a Native American character, to see
such practices are alive and kicking.
Depp received a fair amount of
kick-back for his choice to portray a
Native American, and claimed that
he believed he had Native American
ancestry; this has not been proved.
The theory of evolution suggests
to us that change must be gradual,
incremental, and natural, but the
rate at which Hollywood is adapting
itself to its market-demographic is
achingly slow; despite how much
the industry may will it, the USA
isn’t a homogenous clone-world
filled with thousands of Ryan
Goslings and Emma Stones. The
film industry is sick. While we
should rightly criticise the Academy
for their refusal to include actors
like Idris Elba or Will Smith in
their list of nominees, what the
DuVernay Test would do is shift the
attention back towards the root of
the problem: the channels of money
and power that flow through the
Hollywood studios. There are few
roles out there for minority actors,
and all-too-often they are shut out
of potential roles in favour of white
actors, who offer a more ‘bankable’
alternative.
In her emotional Emmy
acceptance speech, Viola Davis said
that "the only thing that separates
women of colour from anyone else
is opportunity. You cannot win an
Emmy for roles that are simply
not there." We should be angry at
the industry’s refusal to promote
minority actors, not only during
awards season, but throughout all
stages of film production. What
we see when we look at the list of
nominees for the Oscars is the tip
of an iceberg of inequality.Tests like
the DuVernay Test help shed light
on this, and set out a new path for
the future.
