We should take the fascist threat seriously
As well as hurting those caught in the cross-fire,
the hatred and fear of refugees is spreading

acism, xenophobia and
Islamophobia have
reached a new height
in light of the ‘refugee-
crisis’ and more recently the sexual
harassment incidents in Germany
on New Year’s Eve. This Saturday,
Dover saw another big anti-
immigration rally by groups like the
English Defense League, National
Front, South East Alliance, Britain
First, BNP and UK PEGIDA
(don’t even try to figure out what
PEGIDA stands for, the acronym
Far-right
groups
descended
on Dover to
voice their
“concern”
about
non-white
immigration
Fascists
were seen
attacking
each other
and their
own coach
only “makes sense” in German).
In September, far-right groups
descended on Dover to voice
their “concern” about non-
white immigrants. Dover carries
symbolism for the far-right as
they try to “defend their shores”
from people who desperately need
our help and compassion. Groups
like Kent Anti-Racism Network
organised a counter-demo and were
supported by many locals and other
activists.
Anti-fascism activists travelled
to Dover to prevent the neo-Nazis
from marching through Dover.
In light of the protests, Section 60
& 60AA powers were in place in the
Dover district on the Saturday of the
demonstration, requiring people to
remove their face masks and giving
officers in uniform the power to
stop any person and search them for
weapons or harmful instruments.
Throughout the day there was
a lot of violent fighting, with the
riot police failing to keep the two
groups from clashing on several
occasions. This resulted in several
people getting hurt, a lot of them
obtaining head injuries from items
such as bricks being thrown. In the
beginning, anti-fascist protesters
succeeded in delaying the fascists’
march by containing them at the
Dover Priory station (their starting
point). Police eventually escorted
the far-right demonstrators to their
rallying point close to the docks.
By this time only a fraction of the
original fascist protesters remained
to listen.
Violence had erupted before the
demonstration. At a motorway
service station in Maidstone on the
M20 route from London to Dover,
five buses organised by the Anti-
Fascist Network (AFN) clashed
with a bus of Chelsea Headhunters.
These football hooligans are also
vastly involved with Combat 18
(18 for AH = Adolf Hitler). A
fight rapidly started, and escalated,
with members of the two groups
throwing bricks, wood, and bins
back and forth, resulting in several
injuries.
The fascists then went on to attack
a bus of Russian children, before
they smashed in one of the anti-
fascists coaches’ windshield and
windows, and drew swastikas on
two coaches with blood. One of the
coach drivers was injured during the
attacks.
Fascists were seen attacking each
other and their own coach, once
more proving that complete and
utter idiocy does indeed exist.When
police arrived they found a bag of
knives, nunchucks, knuckledusters
and other weapons on the fascists’
coach and subsequently arrested
several men.
Police removed the right-wing
group from the scene and then
detained the anti-fascist group on
the coaches for almost six hours
under Section 1 of the Police
and Criminal Investigations Act.
All passengers had to remain on
the coaches and were filmed and
searched. Police thereby prevented
the AFN coaches from joining the
rally in Dover and opposing the
far-right and their march against
immigration. Without the aid of
the London AFN coaches the anti-
fascists weren’t able to maintain
their blockage of the fascists’ march
in Dover. To those on the coaches
it seemed an awful lot like the
police detained the AFN coaches
for precisely this reason, thereby
indirectly supporting the fascist
march.

Every person in Dover or the
service station that stood against
fascism on Saturday could see
very clearly what the real threat
to this country is. It is the angry,
white, middle-aged men in Enoch
Powell T-shirts and with “refugees
not welcome” emblazoned on flags
(kudos for originality). I know
it’s hard to take people in ANTI-
ANTIFA hoodies seriously, but
the hatred and fear of refugees they
stand for is spreading across Europe.
The left has no problem with free speech
We aren’t living in the Orwellian police state as some would have you believe

F
reedom of speech is the
right to speak without
censorship or restraint by
the government. At least,
that’s what Google says. How does
the British establishment fare when
we look at restrictions on freedom
of speech?
Anti-discrimination laws protect
people from hate speech.These laws
limit freedom of speech for those
who aren’t persecuted in exchange
for protecting freedom of speech
for those who are. The laws prevent
the exclusion of minorities and
persecuted groups,and without such
protections a member of a minority
group could easily be frightened into
silence by a hostile culture. This is a
clear-cut example of how political
correctness and freedom of speech
are not necessarily opposed and can
even complement one another.
We also have regulators. Ofcom
and IPSO regulate what mass
media can say in order to maintain
a degree of journalistic integrity and
legality, and prevent discrimination.
Last year The Sun spoke of “1
in 5 Brit Muslims’ sympathy for
jihadis”, based on a survey which
actually asked if said Muslims had
“sympathy with young Muslims
who leave the UK to join fighters
in Syria”. The question failed to
define which meaning of ‘sympathy’
was meant, and didn’t specify who
these fighters may fight for (with no
mention of the term ‘jihadi’).
This misuse of data was so blatant
that the company carrying out the
poll, Survation, publicly separated
themselves from The Sun’s claim.
IPSO received over 2000 complaints
about the article, printed on the 23rd
November 2014, but are yet to give
a ruling.
The Sun also found itself in hot
waterwhenitprintedKatieHopkin’s
infamous article including the line
“Rescue boats? I’d use gunships to
stop migrants”, which could be seen
as discriminatory or encouraging
violence. It resulted in over 400
complaints to IPSO. This time the
organisation responded with a firm
rejection of the complaints in the
Greer vs The Sun case.
On the 11th
of January 2014 a
terrorism commentator on Fox
News called Birmingham a “no-go
zone” for non-Muslims. This time,
Ofcom called the incident a “serious
breach” and passed a judgement.
What price did Fox News have to
pay? Two apologies.
Amongst the many claims that
political correctness has gone mad,
these three famous cases show
state intervention delayed by a
slow bureaucracy, defending Katie
Hopkins’ words, and requesting
apologies as ‘punishment’.
Political correctness is discussed
as some monolith inhibiting free
speech it finds offensive, yet Katie
Hopkins, The Sun and Donald
Trump are safe from its punishment:
a slap on the wrist.
If freedom of speech isn’t under
threat legally, the claim becomes
that left wing PC ideology limits
it culturally. Let’s take a look at
left wing opinions on controversial
topics.
What about gender imbalances
in academia? A product of
societal gender roles, we see men
encouraged into STEM subjects
and women into arts subjects by a
culture depicting men as intelligent
and women as passionate. There are
more arts than STEM graduates
and, correspondingly, more female
than male graduates. If we want
gender equality in higher education
then surely we should tackle the
gender roles limiting both sexes?
What about discussing the taboo
subject of racial imbalances in
Political
correctness
and
freedom
of speech
are not
necessarily
opposed
scholarship grants? In the US,
white students get 75.6% of merit
grant funding despite being 61.8%
of the student population.
To balance this there are many
scholarships prioritising race in
their selection process. With these
grants taken in to account, white
students receive 59.3% of funding –
much closer to their 61.8% share of
the population.
Race-specific grants exist to
counteract racial imbalances which
start earlier in life. A black child in
America is more likely than a white
child to be brought up in poverty
and have less access to education
economic support. If race-specific
grants are to become obsolete
then surely we need to end racial
injustice?
What about the taboo subject of
criticising Islam? It’s perfectly fine
as long as it’s done in a respectful
manner and held to the same
standards as criticism of any other
religion with disrespect sometimes
coming in the form of Islamophobia.
October 2014-October 2015 saw
a 47.6% increase in hate crimes
against Muslims compared to the
same period the previous year, with
triple the number of reports after
the Paris attacks.
Holding other religions as
accountable as Islam is also
important – criticism of treatment of
women and LGBT communities in
Muslim Middle Eastern countries
should be mirrored by similar
criticism in Christian African
nations. If we want to discuss Islam,
can’t we use the discussion to reflect
on our own culture and mutually
grow?
The left has no problem with
discussing these issues: gender roles,
racial injustice and religious freedom
have all been commonplace topics
for left wing politics for centuries.
What the left takes takes issue
with is politics of rhetoric and
insults. Katie Hopkins isn’t
criticised for breaking unspoken PC
rules,but for turning a discussion on
the social and political impact of the
refugee crisis into “show me bodies
floating in water… I still don’t care”.
When Germaine Greer receives
criticism it’s for ignoring discussions
on trans rights and simply claiming
transgender women are “not
women”, not for being un-PC.
The modern left doesn’t reject
discussion, it rejects the idea that we
should have to put up with hate in
our political system.
