should be worried.
The past 14 months
have seen a mass
excavation of her earlier work, with
four of her works being produced
in the UK. From Maxine Peake’s
tongue-twisting turn in The Skriker,
a highlight of the Manchester
International Festival, to the
National Theatre’s double bill of
Light Shining in Buckinghamshire
and Here We Go, Churchill’s work
has been granted an attention
normally reserved for the recently
deceased.
But she is alive and kicking at 77
years of age, still preoccupied with
fragile mortality, as evidenced by
her newest work, Escaped Alone,
currently showing at the Royal
Court. In her typically blunt style,
the play is a trim 50 minutes long,
although within that time she
manages to pack in more questions
Churchill
explores
the space
between
sentimental
unexamined
domesticity
and a void
of existential
horror
and concepts than most playwrights
do with twice the length. Well
into her fifth decade of writing,
Churchill’s advancing age is perhaps
reflected in the choice of cast: four
women who are all described in the
script as ‘at least seventy’.
Such a combination is incredibly
rare in theatre (indeed, in any
art form), and it seems that the
four leads are all ready to prove
themselves, putting in electrifying
performances: Deborah Findlay
is Sally, an ex-medic with a
pathological fear of cats; Kika
Markham bends her body into a
rigid ball of energy as the nervy
Lena, who suffers from depression
and agoraphobia; June Watson
hardens herself as the ex-con,
possible murderer Vi; and Linda
Bassett puts in a barnstorming
performance as Mrs Jarrett, the
neighbour who encroaches on the
trio, and is as a result inevitably on
the periphery.
The four women sit in the garden
during a warm afternoon, and
drink tea, that most parochial and
Escaped
Alone
packs
in more
questions
and
concepts
than most
plays twice
its length
The veteran playwright packs a punch with a powerful and lyrical indictment of modernity
cosy of commodities, one whose
inoffensive charm rests upon a
foundational history of colonial
expansion, oppressive empire, and
the slave trade. It is this space,
between a sentimental unexamined
domesticity and a void of existential
horror, that Churchill inhabits with
her work; indeed, this dichotomy
is expanded upon quite literally, as
the green lawn intermittently gives
way to a blank nether-world, where
Mrs Jarrett relays stark messages
of disaster upon disaster. Is it a
prophecy? A warning? Nothing is
certain. Designer Peter Mumford’s
lighting is brutal – a coil of metal
wire glows around the periphery of
the stage,like a coiled filament of an
incandescent bulb, or the familiar
orange flame of a toaster, only any
warmth is snuffed out by its scale,
as thoughts of home comforts spill
over into industrial wastes.
Jarrett’s descriptions of the
bleak future are delivered with
an abruptness that is by turns
comic and desolating. From a tale
involving food stocks being diverted
