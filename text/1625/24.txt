A
fter a successful
campaign last academic
year, Mentality has
succeeded once again in
capturing the interests of the staff
and student body alike. On the 19th
January 2016, Sir Anthony Seldon
‘headlined’ at Mentality’s most
recent event, giving an honest and
humbling talk about his personal
experience of mental health both in
and outside the world of education.
He spoke about the pressures of
university and how looking after
oneself often becomes sidelined
by students at world class and
high pressured institutions such
as Imperial College, giving some
simple tips for how to achieve better
mental health whilst studying.
As a testament to Mentality’s
Reflecting on Mentality
hard work and their impact on
campus, approximately 90 people,
both students and staff, attended
Sir Anthony Seldon’s talk and gave
overwhelmingly positive feedback.
Additionally, Sir Anthony himself
praised Mentality, stating that he
was ‘inspired by Mentality’s work
and felt honoured to take part in
their campaign.’
Mentality has been a highly active
and eminent student campaign at
Imperial over the past two years
and has enabled the completion of
the largest student mental health
survey ever held at a UK university,
receiving over 1000 responses.
Armed with this data, Mentality
have started to elicit change on
campus, with college pledging
to prioritise student welfare and
mental health for the foreseeable
future.
Small, but powerful changes, can
already be seen: the counselling
service has expanded, signposting
of available help has become clearer
and personal tutors are being given
additional training in mental health.
Nonetheless, there is more work
to be done, and continued action
is required to ensure that Imperial
remains dedicated to changing
