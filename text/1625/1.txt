The Student Newspaper of Imperial College London
Y
esterday the union told
RAG its magazine of
adverts and satire was
“beyond the acceptable
bounds of satire or mockery”. RAG
werealsowarnedthattheindividuals
involved in writing it could be
faced with serious consequences
from the college if they continued
to distribute the magazine as this
would be considered “elevated
harassment”.
Not banning it as such, the union
strongly advised RAG to surrender
all leftover copies as well as issue
an apology to all those affected,
understood by FELIX to be the

Union President.
FELIX has seen the 16 page
handout, which is mainly adverts
for RAG week events, including the
bungee jump, tunnel tours and the
Valentine’s Ball. There are three or
four pages of ‘satire’ of the union-
hack variety, which (obviously)
we are unable to print here. The
offending piece was a mock diary
entry, reminiscent of FELIX
Hangman’s ‘Diary of a Fresher’
written from the perspective of the
Union President.
Its writer told FELIX they were
“appalled” at the union’s decision to
“censor” the piece.
“I hope that the Union's attempts
to withdraw all copies of the
uncensored version will not be
successful, and that the students
RAG mag accused of
"harassment and bullying"
The handout will no longer be distributed after union
tells RAG it's "an unacceptable personal attack"
who do get to see the Mag as-is will
realise how absurd the response of
the Union has been”.
500 copies of the 2000 magazines
RAG printed have already been
given out around campus. This cost
RAG around £400.
Alice Gast, the president of
Imperial, who wrote a short
introduction for the magazine, said
today: "This year’s RAG Magazine
is a discredit to RAG’s legacy and to
the College".
"I find the mean spirited approach
to targeting of individuals within
the magazine disgusting and am
sorry that I agreed to provide a note
for inclusion in it".
"I’m pleased to see the Union’s
strong response..."

be alcohol free
Circle Line changes will see drinking swapped for
good deeds
T
he ICSM Student Union
has been forced to reign
in its plans for RAG
week, due to growing
pressure from the college over recent
alcohol-fuelled bad behaviour.
The annual Circle Line Pub
Crawl usually involves a charity
bucket election for ICSM RAG at
stations around the Circle Line, as
well as stops as multiple pubs along
the way. The night usually ends at
the Clapham Grand.
However, this year, the ICSMSU
has announced to its members that
pub stops will not be an official part
of the event. Any student visiting
one on the day will be doing so
“on their own actions, not as an
ambassador of ICSMSU”.
Pub stops will be replaced
with volunteering opportunities,
including street collections, singing
in hospitals and other volunteering
opportunities at stops on the Circle
line. Any student involved will also
get free entry to the club afterwards.
The President of the Medical
School’s Union told students on
Monday that scrubs may not be
worn in the club afterwards.
This comes after students on the
medic boat club’s trip to Leuven
were refused passage on a P&O ferry
after students were deemed “drunk
and disorderly”. The ICSMSU has
since banned alcohol consumption
on coaches.
This and other alcohol-related
incidents over the years now
threaten ICSM students union’s
independence. In an email to the
medical student body this week,
the ICSMSU president said: “The
history of events has now led to the
heads of College questioning why
the faculty of medicine should have
its own Students’ Union”.
