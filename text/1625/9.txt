usiness sustainability as
a concept came about
in the early 70s, with
controversial publications
such as The Limits to Growth,
addressing environmental and social
consequences of economic growth.
Since the ‘green business’ model
began to establish its domain, little
attention was paid to the discipline
until the last 7-8 years. We can
now see an exponential growth
in the number of businesses and
organisations looking to minimise
their local and global harm to the
environment, community, and
society – aiming to make profits
without compromising future
generations.
So why has the response to the
sustainable business concept been
so slowly incorporated into many
business models?
Firstly, those initial investments
to incorporate a more efficient
lower efficiency in the short term.
Secondly, because few businesses
act to run sustainably, there is little
evidence behind statements, such
as “positive correlations between
environmental performance and
business performance”. We thus
have a situation where businesses
huddle like penguins carrying on
with the standard practice, not one
business wanting to be the first to
make that much needed transition.
However, change is finally coming
about. The UK’s green economy
was estimated to grow by 4.9 to
5.5% in 2015, with a 48% return
rate in energy efficient investments
for large businesses. Demand for
greener products is also seen to be
increasing. A lot of this change can
be attributed to an increase in public
demand for greener products. For
example, there is an ever growing
demand for meat substitute products
such as Quorn as the environmental
impacts of eating meat gain more
and more notoriety. The shift is
clearly visible; we now have to pay
to use plastic bags in supermarkets,
in an attempt to reduce waste,
something that, a few years ago, was
generally unheard of in the UK.

As more and more businesses shift
their business model to a greener
alternative, there is likely to be a
dominoeffectleadingtotheforeseen
exponential increase in ‘Green
Business’ models. It is important
that this change occurs especially
technology, would deter any
corporation, especially when the
theory is yet to prove itself. I mean,
why would any corporation invest
millions for huge organisational
changes, when such changes
could expose these corporations
to short term risk associated with

rom space, Earth is a
sensational sight often hard
to grasp because seeing
where all of human history
has occurred,can be quite emotional
and very impactful. As time goes
by, visible signs of climate change
start to appear. Those on land may
notice air pollution, deforestation,
or even rises in temperature and
sea level. However astronauts are
the only ones to bear witness to
the mighty destruction of Earth,
macroscopically. According the
Michael Lopez-Alegria (former
astronaut 1995-2007) they can see
the effects of human presence on
the planet. For example a different
hue to the air indicates air pollution
and contamination. Deforestation
is also recognisable and so is the
decimation of our water reservoir,
as bodies of water noticeably
becoming smaller. Capturing these
photos from space allows astronauts
to raise awareness of the fragility
of the planet and its ecosystem, to
those of us safe at home.
UK’s green
economy
was
estimated
to grow by
4.9 to 5.5%
in 2015
in developed countries, to set an
example for developing countries
to follow. With intimidating
threats from climate change, such
as loss of natural resources, habitat
destruction and species extinctions,
there is a need to preserve and work
with nature and the environment so
that a long term valuable economy
is maintained.
