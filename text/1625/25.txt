This week, after committing
anti-union thoughtcrime,
you are taken to Meeting
Room 101. “Who rose 15
places in the NSS rankings?”
they ask you.
“Don’t make me say it!” you
cry.
But you say it because they
get everyone in the end.

This week you are having sex
with your girlfriend and it’s
all going pretty well; however,
at the point of climax you
momentarily forget her name
and yell the closest thing you
can remember.Unfortunately
it’s her mum’s.
This week you are chosen as
the third new host of Top
Gear. The producers saw
you passed out by one of the
ferraris at South Kensington
and assumed you were
knowledgable on cars. In
reality you’d mistaken it for
your Uber.
This week you and Matt
LeBlanc are chosen as the
new hosts of Top Gear. You
have yet to pass your driving
test and as a result are always
stuck in second gear.
This week you are censored
by the union. Nooooo!
Fortunately, they were so
quick off the bat that you
were censored before you
even thought of it. What was
it again? Um.
This week you receive some
disappointing exam results
and decide to pursue your
dream that you’ve always had
of being a fisherman. I don’t
know where this horoscope
is going I’m just working
through some things at the
moment.
This week you wish your
housemate would stop
having loud and rigorous
sex with random guys she
brings back after nights out.
Especially when you’re in
the room trying to finish
problem sheets.
This week you miss the
familiar cosiness of halls: the
lack of bills, the feeling that
there was always someone to
talk to, the sound of someone
else having sex next door, the
free sunday breakfasts, and
the nearness of university.
Sigh.
This week you are reminded
that we all die alone – let’s
be honest, and no one will
remember anything you do
for that much longer. That
is except for Chris Kaye –
praise be for those fresh pizza
bases!
This week you start watching
Making a Murderer;
however, you get one episode
in and, what the fuck, there
are nine more episodes?
Ugh. I haven’t even finished
Breaking Bad yet. Also no
way am I paying for Netflix.
This week the Daily Mail
ask “WHO WILL SPEAK
FOR ENGLAND?” and in
a surprising turn of events
you are picked.Unfortunately
you were still hungover from
ACC and inadvertently cause
a constitutional crisis.
This week you disseminate
hateful and offensive
propaganda all over campus
early in the morning, before
anyone can stop you. You
guessed it! You’re the FELIX
Editor! Well done you.
