T
he phrase ‘electronic
superhighway’ has
become, a mere 40 or so
years after it was coined,
no more than a vague anachronism.

into television programmes,
allowing starving commuters to
watch breakfast on iPlayer, to a
man-made landslide that buries
villagers, with fragments of rock
landing ‘onto the designated child’s
head’, Churchill’s text is a relentless
take-down of modernity. With
mentions of property developers,
laptop cancers, and poisonous sugar,
a comparison could be made with
Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror
series,although Churchill’s ideas are
more refined and abstract, bracing
in their meaningless surrealism. Her
penchant for chaos seems instead
to draw on the work of speculative
writers, especially J. G. Ballard’s
themes of social isolation and
resolution through turmoil.
Her writing, as well, continues
to develop. Escaped Alone is full of
phrases that stick in your mind,
swirling round and round like an icy
mist – ‘the chemicals leaked through
cracks in the money,’ ‘children fell
asleep in class and didn’t wake
up.’ At points, she takes both the
language and the performers to
their limit, with a monologue
delivered by Findlay at a breakneck
speed rivalling Beckett’s Not I for
its poetic lyricism. Churchill leads
us, as an audience, up to a point
where language begins to fracture,
revealing its complete, abstracted,
quicksilver character.
The repetitious nature of Mrs
Jarrett’s interspersions, of which
there are seven, begin to suffer from
familiarity towards the end of the
play, and nothing feels as gripping
as when she first steps from the
garden into the black wastes. But
still, this is some of Churchill’s most
clear-cut,daring writing to date; the
scenes in the garden, which sizzle
with a charged undercurrent of
unease and neglect, are beautiful in
their awkward terror.
The French philosopher Simone
Weil wrote that loving one’s fellow
man is merely a question of asking
‘what is your torment?’ Escaped
Alone offers us the opportunity to
simply listen,and try and unpick the
rotting agony lying just underneath
the skin of her four leads. It is an
unsettling, brilliant work; we have
more to fear from Mrs Jarrett’s
prophesies than from the thought
that Churchill could – after fifty
years – be losing her brutally-cold
force.
At the Royal Court till 12 March.

Going back in time on the Electronic Superhighway
The landmark exhibition brings together 50 years of art and technology co-evolution
Fred Fyles
Film Editor
Nam June Paik in the mid-70s, has
fast become a relic of the bygone age
of utopian technology. While Paik’s
idea of a communication revolution
that has become so far-reaching as to
become, in his words,‘a springboard
for new and surprising human
endeavors’, modern technology has
instead brought with it the threat
of coercion, manipulation, and
ever-present surveillance. While
such an optimistic view of human
endeavors has since been consigned
to the growing pile of historical
disappointments, the Whitechapel
Gallery is unafraid to take a
retrospective look at the concept.
Indeed, it forms the name of its
newest exhibition, which looks back
at the past 50 years of interaction
between the artistic and the digital;
the phrase’s ethos is reflected in this
retrograde collection of work, which
is exuberant, ground-breaking, and
wholly revolutionarily.
As first impressions go, it’s a bit
of a surprise. The Whitechapel
have taken the (as far as I know)
unprecedented decision to
arrange the exhibition in reverse
chronological order, and the result
is something that is an exhibition
striking in its immediate familiarity.
For most retrospectives, be it of
Caravaggio or Caro, the collection
will take a strictly normative
chronological route; the result
is an exhibition that tends to be
most familiar in its centre, where
artists reach their creative peaks,
sandwiched between early periods
of juvenilia, and later works that
simply seem outdated. In contrast,
the Whitechapel exhibition begins
with what is most relevant and
familiar: artworks produced in
direct response to the needs and
pressures of the modern age.
Thus, we have Amalia Ulman’s
four-month long project Excellences
and Perfections, perhaps the first
piece of performative art produced
entirely through the medium of
Instagram, and Mahmoud Khaled’s
staged conversation Do You Have
Work Tomorrow?, which transforms
the virtual social space of Grindr
to a physical, temporally-isolated
reality. The interplay between the
promise of increased connectivity
social media brings, and the isolated
actuality, it a running theme. As
we move back in time through the
exhibition, the references in the
work become more and more dated,
and the technology used cruder;
eventually, we reach the last room,
where Peter Sedgley’s circle works
appear to shift before our eyes
due to the changing lighting, and
a poster for the ICA’s Cybernetic
Serendipity exhibition questions
the new shifts technology will bring
to the art world – a seismic change
that we have just surveyed in the
previous galleries.
Of course, such a concept would
be mere window dressing if the
work inside weren’t any good.
Luckily for us, the curators at the
Whitechapel have managed to put
together a cutting and incisive show,
a wide-ranging retrospective of the
last half-century, which will surely
go down as a landmark exhibition.
From the off, we are introduced
to artworks whose themes, while
possibly synonymous with modern
life, have their roots within the
advent of the technological
revolution.The nature of the cyborg,
omnipresent in popular culture since
the 1960s, is explored in Aleksandra
Domanovic’s work, which uses
the ‘Belgrade Hand’ – the first
artificial hand with five fingers – to
examine the relationship between
man and machine. Elsewhere we
have mediations on the theme
of representation in the virtual
world; in a society where our self-
representation is primarily made
up of online data, the disturbing,
dizzying video works of both Ryan
Trecartin and Jacolby Satterwhite
show us the self-empowerment of
creating our own narratives.
This theme of narrative control
is echoed in earlier works, such
as Olia Lialina’s 1996 work My
Boyfriend Came Back from the War,
and Lynn Hershman Leeson’s
seminal interactive work Lorna.
The latter tracks the decisions of
an agoraphobic woman, while the
former explores the relationship
between a distant couple after an
unnamed conflict, resulting in a
mosaic of hauntingly black screens.
The depressive nature of both is
a bold contrast to the exuberant
works exhibited towards the
beginning of the exhibition. Nam
June Paik is given a near-obligatory
mention with his multi-screen
assault Internet Dream; but while
personal self-expression may have
fulfilled his prediction for a playful,
liberating world of technology, it
has come at a price, and the more
contemporary pieces belie a sense
of creeping encroachment of civil
liberties.
Trevor Paglan’s map-based work
traces the cable-routes through New
York, juxtaposed against the NSA’s
famously-blocky slideshows, while
his piece Autonomy Cube allows
visitors to hide their movements
through use of an encrypted Wi-Fi
signal. Elsewhere, James Brindle,
coiner of the New Aesthetic,
provides the most directly cutting
piece in the exhibition with
Homo Sacer, a facsimile of the
annoyingly-chirpy, happy-valley-
esque human holograms found
in airports that quotes lines from
UK legislation, warning visitors
with the threateningly bureaucratic
claim that ‘citizenship is a privilege,
not a right’. The addition of Addie
Wagenknecht’s Asymmetric Love, a
chandelier of CCTV cameras that
hang over the room, is a playful
work, but has all the nuance of a
Banksy piece.
Never fear, resistance to erosion
of civil liberties is at hand. Douglas
Coupland defies Facebook’s facial
recognition system by replacing
visages with Mondrian-esque
blocks, echoing designer Craig
Green’s plank masks; Rafael
Lozano-Hemmer’s Surface Tension,
a giant eye that follows the patron
round the gallery, allows us to
confront the usually-indelible
forces of surveillance; and Zach
Blas’ work joyfully subverts both
the heteronormative nature of
internet technology,and the force of
unfettered capitalism propelling it.
“Electronic Superhighway” may
seem like an anachronistic phrase,
and indeed, many of the pieces
displayed in the exhibition attest
to the faster-than-light nature of
internet trends. ASCII art, early
web interfaces, and scratchy live-
TV broadcasts are all dragged out
of the broom closet of technological
history,and brought to the forefront.
Cory Arcangel’s work, which sees
an Instagram post of Paris Hilton
overlaid with a MySpace ripple
effect, brings the world of the
modern and the recently-obsolete
crashing together, making us
wonder whether the hegemonic
grip Facebook et al have on internet
space is truly unbreakable.
But while the phrase itself
may be a blast from the past, the
show is anything but. Electronic
Superhighway displays the dazzling
array of ways technology has
informed art, and provides us with
a cautionary hope for the future,
as artists form the vanguard of a
movement leading us into a brave
new world.
Electronic Superhighway is at
Whitechapel Gallery till 15th
May.
