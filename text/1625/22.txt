f you followed this year’s
Golden Globes, you might’ve
been surprised by Mozart in
the Jungle sweeping the Best
Television series – Comedy, and
Best Actor in a Television series
– Musical or Comedy categories.
By virtue of being an Amazon
Original, this show has flown under
most people’s radars.
I consider that a damn shame,
since the show is actually pretty
good. Following struggling Oboist
Hailey Rutledge,played by a capable
Lola Kirke, the piece chronicles the
lives of the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra, as they attempt to get
to grips with the flamboyant new
maverick conductor Rodrigo; a role
that Gael García Bernal clearly
has quite a lot of fun with. García
Bernal really sinks his teeth into
the character, deftly encompassing
the mix of eccentricity and genius
necessary.
Malcolm McDowell also puts
in a standout performance here,
playing the aging ex-conductor who
struggles to deal with the fact that
he’s past his prime. It’s great to see
so if you’re expecting some great
treatise about the meaning of life
then I really don’t know what to tell
you.I mean,why are you looking for
that in an Amazon series about an
orchestra? Go read The Master and
Margarita or something.
Nevertheless, the characters are
strong enough to keep the show
afloat with much of the humour
coming from their interactions.
Another factor that only helps is the
series’ freshness. The subject matter
is fairly new popular fiction, and so
every development and exploration
manages to keep viewers interested.
If I have any complaints, they are
that the show meanders a tad in the
middle of the first season, and that
at times it can feel too ‘hipster-y’.
But really, what can you expect
from a show produced by Jason
Schwartzman, and I say that as a
huge fan. In fact, the overwhelming
majority of this quirk is the good
kind. If you like Schwartzman’s
usual shtick, you’ll like this; if you
enjoy orchestras, you’ll enjoy this,
and if you’re a fan of good comedy,
you’ll be a fan of this.

him not taking himself too seriously,
and his comedic timing is great. It’s
too bad he doesn’t get more comedic
work. The evergreen Bernadette
Peters also features, owning every
scene she’s in.
The show’s wit is sharp and rarely
predictable. There are quite a few
moments that got big laughs out of
me, and they never felt stale, trite,
or done to death. There’s scarcely
a dull moment, and the viewer is
compelled to keep watching the
series. It is strongly character driven,

B
ojack Horseman is a
show about an alcoholic
horse who was the star
of a Cosby-esque family
sitcom in the 90s, now dealing with
a life of loneliness and depression.
Also, it is fantastic.
The Netflix original animated
series stars Arrested Development’s
Will Arnett, Breaking Bad’s
Aaron Paul and Community’s
Alison Brie in a world where
anthropomorphised animals live
alongside humans, and that’s hardly
the most surreal thing about it.
Bojack, is certainly a show you
need to give time to get your head
around, the first episode gives the
impression of a silly, Family Guy
like animated show with throwaway
jokes and unlikable characters but
all of it is building to what has
been called one of television’s most
accurate portrayals of depression
and a biting satire of Hollywood
culture.
The show’s central character,
Bojack is a deeply unhappy ex-
celebrity,keen to return to the public
eye by releasing an autobiography
of his years on TV. Brie’s Diane
Nguyen comes in to act as ghost
the show begins to really shine in
the latter half of the first season.
It displays the fact that, with the
possible exception of Paul’s Todd,
no character in the show is without
depth. Even the seemingly one-
dimensional (if hilarious) Mr
Peanutbutter displays some of his
own demons that he’s battling.
The second season brings in
some new players in the form of
Lisa Kudrow’s Wanda Pierce (an
owl) and Ben Schwartz’s Rutabaga
Rabitowitz,each fantastic characters
complementing the remaining cast.
The second season also marks a
shift from the satire of Hollywood
and towards more personal stories,
topping with a truly devastating
scene involving someone from
Bojack’s past.
Bojack is a show you need to be
prepared for,a ride of ups and downs
and testament to the success of
Netflix’s release all at once method
of showing TV.

writer for this and serves as the
outside look into Bojack’s mind.
The series shifts between wacky
humour coming from the world’s
animal inhabitants and long drawn
out pieces of wordplay (“There is
nothing funny about stealing a meal
from Neal McBeal the navy Seal”)
then hits the viewer with glimpses
of Bojack self-loathing, Diane’s
deep insecurity and the shallowness
of Hollywood culture.
After some difficulty finding its
footing in the first few episodes,

T
hese past few years, we’ve
seen a sudden shift in
popularity of several
online streaming sites
with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon
Prime being the most popular of the
bunch. They’ve added competition
into the television market and are
growing in popularity by the day.
Netflix have also been expanding
their reach, now present in most
countries around the world. With
all this growth, it begs the question,
can these online streaming sites
replace live cable TV altogether?
First we need to examine why
these services have been so popular
and what they provide that makes
them more appealing than cable.
The most prominent feature of these
services is that they are convenient.
As they are online services, it
means all you need is an internet
connection and a subscription
and you’re ready to go. This means
people can use devices like laptops,
tablets and mobile phones to watch
TV shows and movies, wherever
they may choose. Of course you
need internet access but in this day
and age that’s not really a problem.
It’s not just convenient in terms of
where and how you can watch, it’s
also useful in that you can choose
when to watch as well. You don’t
need to wait for a particular hour on
a certain day and build your activities
around said hour.It is completely up
to you when you want to watch, and
also how much you want to watch.
Binge watching is a natural follow-
however, one should also look what
the internet in general has to offer.
For example, in places like YouTube
and Twitch, creators are able to
provide content which caters to
specific audiences. Watching people
play games, reviewing and reacting
to movies and even teaching some
skills, there is usually something
the internet can provide for you. It
is easier to get access to something
really specific you have in mind.This
is a far cry from cable TV, a feature
it probably can’t really implement as
it tries to cater to the majority.
Online streaming services are also
usually cheaper than a conventional
TV package. So with all these
advantages, can they truly become
the primary method of TV viewing?
Netflix’s president Reed Hastings
certainly thinks so,recently claiming
that internet TV will replace linear
TV in the next 20 years or so.
However personally, I don’t think
this is happening any time soon and
definitely not straight away.
As great as these sites are and
may seem to be, they have their
limitations. For example, not all
the shows and movies are available
on any one site. To watch all your
favourite shows, you may need
to subscribe to several different
services all at once. Also some
shows just simply don’t have an
online presence at all. To add to
this, shows and movies are regularly
taken down and brought back
due to a multitude of reasons on
various services. One of the perks of
cable TV is just browsing through
channels and finding a random
movie you want to watch, or seeing
a rerun of your favourite old series.
An additional point to note is
that most content-producers and
pay-TV operators have been adept
at making sure consumers cannot
watch current episodes of their
favourite shows.In other words,they
have not made the same mistake
that newspapers did a decade ago,
Game of Thrones has a very large
budget as well as planning behind
it, and it is a very long time before
before something like Netflix will
be able to produce something
original along that level of scale and
calibre. That hasn’t stopped them
from continuing to produce various
unique shows to enjoy, however,
and it is great that they’re churning
them out, albeit slowly.
A major obstacle these sites have
is also the inability to air live sports.
The rights to live sports and their
channels are expensive and they
are a market online streaming sites
have not been able to take over. You
can’t really binge football games; the
fun is watching them in a group,
socializing and commenting on the
play.
Online streaming services
definitely have their advantages
and sure as heck aren’t going away
any time soon. In the short term,
they haven’t even come close to
killing cable and it is more likely
cable TV will have a prolonged
decline. The number of households
having cut the cord entirely is pretty
insignificant compared to cable
subscribers.
Having said all this, the switch
to online TV is a meaningful one,
and has the potential to accelerate
over time. There are children who
have, and will, grow up without
cable altogether. Internet connected
smart TV’s are also becoming more
popular and people may well opt
out of paying cable and just stream
Netflix in their living rooms. Until
that time, I’ll just sit down and
check what BBC One has to offer
at 11pm on Saturday night.
up from this ease of access; after a
long, busy week of hard work, it’s
usually a relaxing experience to
just lie in bed and watch all the
episodes of your favourite series in
one sitting. These services are also
a different experience altogether.
You can note down your favourite
shows and movies and get updates
on new episodes as well as get
recommendations for other things
to watch. With all these things, it’s
not a surprise to see why so many
students use them.
Taking a step back from TV
offering the same content online
for free that they expect subscribers
to pay for. A lot of content-owners
have restricted the rights of these
streaming sites so they cannot air
shows until after they have aired live
on television.
The scope and cost of making a
new show are also pretty substantial.
While these sites do have a number
of brilliant, original shows like
House of Cards, they are not in a
significantly large quantity and
a vast majority of hit dramas are
still on traditional, live television.
