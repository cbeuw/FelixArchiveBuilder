he second of MTV
Brand New for 2016
showcases, hit Camden’s
Electric Ballroom on
Wednesday 27th
January, featuring
up-and-comers Nimmo and Rat
Boy alongside noughties indie
legends Bloc Party.
Nimmo
Nimmo were the first band in the
evening’s lineup. Their electro pop
songs were catchy with the band
looking extremely happy to be on
stage, if a bit nervous. Their songs
initially felt a bit on the long side
but they definitely grew on me by
the end. They definitely have the
possibility of being the ‘next big
thing’, and are of a similar vein to
Jungle.The chemistry and songs are
there for a solid foundation.
Rat Boy
Next up was the 19 year old Rat
Boy (aka Jordan Cardy) and his
band. It’s clear from the start that
many people,most between the ages
of 14 to 16, were looking forward to
his performance. It makes sense as
his lyrics are generally tinged with
teenage angst.Rat Boy sounds like a
JamieT clone who could potentially
emulate the success of the original
but I feel like he’s a bit of a ‘record
label manufactured’ Jamie T rather
than something more natural.
The sound quality is extremely
poor (with a sound check almost
seeming like an impossibility). The
kiddies mosh like there’s nothing
wrong but a loud siren-like sound
plays between songs, and I’m unsure
if it’s intentional or not (it didn’t
sound right at all). The rest of the
crowd almost look surprised and
shocked that the music gets such
a good response. There was even a
stage invasion during the last song
‘Fake ID’, which I’m sure all of his
fans would have needed to buy any
drinks during the evening.
Having listened to studio versions
of some of his songs previously,
they’re actually quite good, if
unoriginal. Maybe with a sound
check, he may have been much
better than he was on this evening.
However, from the audience
participation I saw this evening,he’ll
do well no matter what happens.
Bloc Party
Bloc Party’s return after a two year
hiatus was surprising due to the fact
that half of the line-up had left
during the break. Replacing Matt
Tong (drums) and Gordon Moakes
(bass) with Louise Bartle and Justin
Harris, respectively, the band have
been building up to the release of
their new (less than acclaimed)
album Hymns.
Entering with new song ‘The
Good News’, they started out a
bit too slow and the energy of
the audience was slightly drained
with mild swaying being the most
active response. It’s a nice start but
nothing special. To me, it felt like if
it continued in this way this could
have been the most dull concert I’d
ever been to.
Thankfully, they go straight into
2008’s ‘Mercury’. Whilst it’s not
Bloc Party’s most famous song, the
dancey vibes of the song energise
the audience. Kele Okereke (lead
vocals, rhythm guitar) hypes up the
crowd with some playful banter.The
musicianship of Harris is truly seen
to be great, and perhaps supasses
his predecessor; he performs with a
saxophone rather than a synth which
makes the song have a bit more
of a ‘human’ feel. Moving swiftly
on to ‘Song For Clay (Disappear
Here)’ and the classic hit ‘Banquet’,
the crowd starts to finally form a
reasonable mosh pit (for a free gig,
anyway). The band also seem to
enjoy themselves, relaxing into the
corporate setting. Bartle shows her
Racism is so metal
Rob Garside

his article is something I
need to get off my chest.
I love heavy music with
aggressive themes, from
Black metal to hardcore to grind – I
love it all. I love the catharsis and
thrill that a pounding drum and
palm muted guitar line can provide
but sometimes the shit that comes
with it really makes me wonder why.
Metal has well established
problems with racism (see: below),
sexism (see: lack of inclusion of
any female members unless they
are overly sexualised in a “female
fronted” band) and a culture
that suffocates new ideas or
experimentation (see: recent festival
bills with the same headliners as in
the early 90s).
This week it was racism that reared
its ugly head. What has particularly
set me off is the latest event in a long
line of racist events (Google it: there
are a couple) that make up Phil
Anselmo’s life. At the last week’s
annual commemoration of iconic
Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrel,
the former Pantera member (also
a member of Down, Superjoint
white wine backstage). This was
captured on camera and put up
on YouTube (however the video
was put up on video a week after
the event as the filmer was afraid
of the backlash from tarnishing
Anselmo’s name). The video is
conclusive, Anselmo’s actions were
horrific.There is no doubt that he is
a piece of scum who, whilst a gifted
vocalist, deserves to be recognised
and castigated by the mainstream
metal media for the awful bigot he
is.
But instead of reacting to a
clear scandal (although one that
has happened a bit too much in
Anselmo’s life) metals major media
outlets reacted slowly – if at all –
to this despite in some cases being
present at the dimebash event.
Kerrang, Decibel and Revolvers were
loath to call Anselmo out on his
clearly racist actions as they were
seemingly afraid of damaging their
working relationship with a metal
icon (Decibel and Revolver have had
no mention of this even happening
on their site in an age when being
first to report on everything is so
treasured). Others such as Metal
Hammer chose to hide behind safe
language using terms like “Nazi-
esque gesture” and “allegedly
shouted White Power,” when the
guy clearly did it. Eventually after
the smaller blogs had broke the
news (and a couple of days later
when the mainstream media finally
caught up), these new articles
were bombarded with metal fans
defending Anselmo. Cries of “it’s
just a joke” and “metal is meant
been released at this point, very few
people in the crowd knew the songs
and the feeling from the crowd
went to euphoria to frustration
very rapidly. People were calling
out for (debut album) Silent Alarm
tracks during this marathon of
new songs, with Kele asking ‘Who
let these fools in?’ but alas most
people agreed with the hecklers.
It was saddening to see as the live
versions of the songs are a lot better
than the studio versions, especially
‘Different Drugs’. Saying that,
‘The Love Within’ was just barely
listenable to (though the album
version is actually unlistenable)
and got the best response of the
new songs. The band also seemed
a bit disappointed with the general
response from the audience during
this segment but they were playing
generally very boring parts, with
the raw skill of the band not on
display. In particular, the drumming
is extremely basic and disappointing
to watch as Bartle is clearly capable
of performing to a much higher
standard.
Thankfully, the concert did finish
on a high with the Silent Alarm
track ‘This Modern Love’reminding
most people why they fell in love
with Bloc Party back in the mid to
late 00s. Russell Lissack (guitarist)
still impresses to this day and the
audience were practically hugging
each other at the climax. It’s truly
the highlight of the night, and I
would even go so far to say it saved
the gig.
Asking the audience if they
“wanted a banger”, Kele and co
finished with ‘Ratchet’ which
produced the most violent mosh
pit of the night despite the odd
person still heckling the band for
more Silent Alarm tracks rather
than a (somewhat) recent hit. It was
a great way to end a concert with
the energy of the crowd equaling,
possibly even surpassing, the energy
during ‘Banquet’.
After this, the band left the stage.
Despite cries for another song, with
the most popular suggestions being
‘Helicopter’ and ‘Flux’, the band
did not return. I can’t blame them
completely for leaving without an
encore, as it was a corporate gig and
the fact that a large number of the
audience seemed disinterested with
the band.
Saying that, the disinterest was
a result of the uninspiring setlist. I
believe they could have gotten away
with a Hymns heavy set but they
needed to spread the new songs out
a bit more and it did feel almost
criminal to not play ‘Helicopter’.
Many left disappointed, despite the
event being free, as the crowd and
probably the band knew how much
better this concert could have been.
to be offensive” echoed from the
keyboards of hicks.
It should take no explaining why
I’m annoyed at this but let’s spell
it out. Famous man uses a far right
salute and slogan. Man in crowd
videos racist stuff and waits a week.
Big media fails to report it despite
being at the event (they were happy
enough to host videos of Anselmo
singing the Pantera classic ‘Walk’)
and despite seeing the video. When
reported, a scary number of metal
fans didn’t seem to work out that
racism is bad and can’t be excused
as a joke.
It really annoys me that a society
in love with being a subculture and
“for the outcast”is so bad at excusing
the persecution of minorities.
Not cool metal world.
Not cool.
