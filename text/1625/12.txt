T
o walk into Painting the
Modern Garden: Monet
to Matisse at The Royal
Academy is to plunge
into a world of exuberant greenery,
of sun-dappled paths, manicured
lawns, a land where it is always
spring, and Paris is always in bloom.
“Perhaps I owe it to flowers”
Monet once said, “that I became
a painter”. Within the exhibition
amongst the best of Monet’s work,
it is easy to see how Monet’s unique
painting style, from his brushstrokes
to use of colour was informed by
his love of gardening. Only quick
frenetic flashes of colour could do
justice to the sheer mass of leaves
and petals, and the light filtering
through them that Monet painted.
It is undoubtedly Monet’s show.
No exhibition on gardens could
be complete without Waterlilies or
Japanese Footbridge, but the strength
of the curation lies in the fact that
the other artists featured give Monet
a run for his money.
The Royal Academy’s colourful exhibition brings together gardens of all times and styles
One of the standout works of
the earlier galleries is Frédéric
Bazille’s The Terrace at Méric; it is
an unfinished work, but almost
better for it. A ghostly figure of a
woman carries in a bench, melting
in and out of the shadows. In the
background the sunlit path has all
the solidity that the figure doesn’t.
Broad peach strokes clash against
the burnt umber of the shade to
create the bright heat of a Turkish
summer.
Gustave Caillebotte’s Nasurtium,
painted in 1880, is one of the few
paintings in the earlier galleries that
feels genuinely revolutionary. Tiny
sparks of scarlet flowers, engulfed
by verdant leaves on fragile stems
are sown without context on a lilac-
mauve ground, it provides a bridge
between the realism of the past and
the abstractism that would follow.
This technique is later amplified
by Monet in Chrysanthemums, an
extreme close up transforms the
flowers into exploding fireworks.
Although the usual suspects
are Renoir, Pissaro and Cézanne,
there are also works by Gauguin,
Gabriele Münter and Paul Klee.
It isn’t all bourgeois rural gardens
replete with creamy pinks and soft
blues either. In Garden Study of the
Vickers Children, huge ghostly lilies
hover over the children with subtle
menace. Edvard Munch’s Apple
Tree in the Garden, an homage to
the biblical allegory depicted in
medieval paintings of gardens,is full
of lurid lemon yellows, ultramarines
and sea greens, which clash against
each other evoking the sinister vein
that runs through all of Munch’s
paintings.
Santiago Rusiñol conjures up a
fading grandeur in his painting
of Spanish gardens. In Gardens
of Monteforte, the golden light
from the setting sun falls through
windows cut in hedges and gilds an
ornamental pond. The fiery oranges
are reflected in the autumnal trees
in the distance. It is the kind of
sumptuous imagery that would not
look out of place in a big budget
movie.
Elsewhere, coming across
Kandinsky’s Murnau Garden II is a
revelation. Stylistically, it is so far
removed from the paintings that
surround it, that it is thrown into
sharp relief, akin to having icy water
splashed in your face (in the best
way possible). Even from the far
end of the gallery it is impossible to
look away from the splodges of mid
yellow, cerulean, and scarlet.
The Royal Academy rightly
devotes much of the final gallery
space to Monet.These last paintings
form the last canvases of his life,
spanning the years of the First

Monet’s
personal
grief is
palpable
As German troops approached
Paris,his brushstrokes become more
frenetic, he loads paint more thickly,
uses bolder, darker colours. Gone is
the pastel prettiness from his earlier
depictions of the footbridge, instead
it is engulfed in flame like brush
strokes, lime green, hot orange,
emerald yellow ochre. Some parts of
the canvas are left unpainted, other
parts are built up in richly textured
impasto, almost Braille like, globs of
paint that dissolve into sculpture the
closer you get.
Monet’s personal grief is palpable;
his stepson was drafted as was
his son. Though Monet is known
painting en plein air, in the later
years, when he painted on large
scale canvases, he worked mainly
in studios from sketches made
outdoors. Monet was never a simple
transcriber of nature, but further
degrees of separation of the source
material combined with his failing
eyesight may have influenced the
evolution of his style towards the
abstract.
The uncontested highlight of
this exhibition is the final gallery
which houses Monet’s Agapanthus
triptych, reunited for the first time
in Europe. The canvases are vast,
panoramic, and if you stand in just
the right place it is possible to fill
your entire field of vision with it.
Lilacs dissolve into greens,into blue,
broad flat strokes of white suggest
lily pads. It is at the zenith of his
exploration of colour over form, the
fluidity of the strokes mirror the
fluidity of the water, the wavering of
the reflections. In the piece’s diffuse
light, it is impossible to stand in
front of these paintings and not be

in awe.
Painting a Modern Garden
is a whistlestop tour of early
20th
century art, charting the
evolution of Impressionism to
Post-Impressionism to the avant
garde movement. It would have
been easy for the pieces to feel too
disparate, but thematically it is
cohesive enough to rise above the
difference in style. It is a shame
that Van Gogh who spent much
of his life painting gardens is not
more heavily featured, but no one

would begrudge the curators their
enthusiasm for Monet. If you go to
one exhibition this year, it should be
this one.
