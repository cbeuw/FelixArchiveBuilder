THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON
felix@imperial.ac.uk
CLUBS & SOCS
A
s an inaugural
collaboration between
Photography and
Art Society, this
photography contest revolves
around the theme of ‘friendship’.
Both societies organise activities of
different natures: ArtSoc organises
street art walking tours and musical
outings every week, while PhotoSoc
organises regular photo walks and
workshops.
However, both of our societies
strongly feel that photography is
a form of art and expression. A
piece of art does not need to be
beautiful, it just needs to make you
feel something. So if you think
you have a photo that conveys the
theme perfectly, take part and stand
a chance to win a pair of tickets
to watch Wicked at the West End
with a mate, jointly sponsored by
PhotoSoc and ArtSoc.
What is the theme?
In Wicked, the plot explores the
friendship between two of the
most unlikely friends who met in
school. The story revolves around
how these two friends grapple
with compromise, acceptance and
standing up for each other; in the
process of doing so, they realise how
much they helped each other grow.
After all, like one of the song goes,
“We are led to those who help us

‘Friendship’ in the name of art
Photosoc and ArtSoc are giving away tickets to Wicked if you can snap a picture on
this theme
most to grow if we let them, and
we help them in return... I know
I’m who I am today because I knew
you”.
The impact our friends make in
our lives is significant and you learn
and grow together with your mates.
This is the essence of friendship that
all of us have experienced, but yet in
a unique way for each of us.So show
us your unique interpretation and
perspective on friendship, and you
might win a pair of tickets to watch
Wicked with your friend!
How do I take part?
All you have to do is to upload a
photo on to Facebook and use the
#icFriendship in the description.
This will be open until 26th
February
and the winner will be announced
on 27th
February.
The winner will be chosen by the
Photosoc and Artsoc committees
and is open to all students at
Imperial.

New Financial Worlds Conference
T
he Imperial College
Finance Society proudly
presents the 5th
annual
New Financial Worlds
Conference 2016, which is set to
take place on the 17th
February at the
prestigious Bloomberg Auditorium
in London. This year will mark the
first conference in several years and
will focus on two key themes of
Investment Banking and Global
Markets. The conference is aimed
at providing students with a strong
insight into the most cutting-edge
and relevant topics in finance in a
medium that is far beyond what
they can learn from just reading the
Financial Times.
Investment Banking talks will
include mergers and acquisitions,
equity issuance and debt capital
markets. Talks will seek to explain
the underlying trends of activity
in this field with unique insight
into private equity, in the context
of current market conditions.
Meanwhile, global markets will
focus on equities, derivatives,
foreign exchange and commodities
trading. The first week of 2016 saw
$1 trillion wiped out of the stock
markets due to the volatility in oil
and in China. Talks from the panel
will seek to outline the drivers of
this volatility, the impact on trading
and the general outlook for the
global economy.
The event itself will host over
200 students and has received a
lot of positive feedback in previous
years, with many students building
successful and lasting relationships
with other delegates and speakers.
Those who impress may even
secure internships with our sponsors
as achieved by many past delegates.
Attending firms include Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan,
Nomura International with a
number of our speakers having also
worked at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Citi and Deutsche Bank.
As such, these speakers are leading
luminaries in the field and their
talks will greatly benefit students
on an educational level and career-
level.
Applications are now open but
we are screening applications
on a rolling basis, so apply soon
to avoid disappointment at:

We look forward to seeing you
there.
