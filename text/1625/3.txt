‘Nuff(ield) said
Imperial triumphs over Cambridge college in University Challenge quarter-finals
We’re not saying the mascot did it, but it did.
M
onday evening saw
the first outing
of the new term
for the seemingly
unstoppable University Challenge
team that is Ben Fernando, Ashwin
Braude, Onur Teymur and their
captain James Bezer. The team
were riding high on the back of
their 305-75 demolition of Sidney
Sussex, Cambridge, but as we all
know, there are no easy games in
this league.
The challenging side from Nuffield
College, Oxford was comprised of
two Americans, a Norwegian and
a South African who were studying
a mix of Economics, Politics,
and International Relations. A
combination which was far too
“artsy” for their Imperial foes, a
collection of three physicists and a
mathematician.
The excitement within the
spectator arena (FiveSixEight) was
palpable from the offset, with all
available tables being taken well
before kickoff. It was standing
room only for the audience as they
watched the intellectual gladiators
do battle in the arena, with only
Jeremy Paxman to mediate the
fierce competition that was to ensue.
A poor start plagued the
Imperial squad, with captain Bezer
handicapping the team on the very
first question, buzzing in before
the end of the question with the

incorrect answer of “Hippocrates”.
Minus five points. No need to panic
though, plenty of time left yet.
The crowd were anxious to see
a return to form, and the answer
of “Hamster” from Fernando
did just that. Woops and cheers
rang through the union building
with the follow up category on
Mathematicians yielding “Hilbert”,
“Godel” and “Riemann” in quick
succession to bring the score back
to a level playing field of 20-20.
Bezer again decided to try
and score another slamdunk but
“M-A-R” turned out to actually be
“D-A-N”. You win some, you lose
some, I guess, and in this case it
was another five points conceded.
Racking up bonus points gave
Nuffield a slender 45-15 lead but it
really isn’t over ‘till it’s over when it
comes to University Challenge.
Supporters watched with baited
breath through the rollercoaster of
emotions that was the following
question. As they heard the word
“physics” from Paxman, spirits rose,
assuming Imperial had it in the bag
but subsided again as the Nuffield
captain buzzed in first. Victory was
snatched from the jaws of defeat
however, with Fernando calmly
collecting the pieces after the
incorrect “Inertia” answer, parrying
with the correct “Hysteresis”. The
crowd erupted in a frenzy unseen
since the last ACC sports night.
But, what should be lurking round
the corner but the apparent Achilles
heel of the team, literature. With
a bonus round that incorporated
Jane Austen came exchanges of “Do
you know?” followed by “I literally
have no idea”. A picture round on
German geography brought the
ship back on course, sending the
score to 45-40 in Imperial’s favour.
What followed was another
breakdown in play as, after Bezer
grabbed the starter for ten with
“Bears”, Imperial went on to throw
away yet more science bonuses.
Chaos occurred in the union as Ben
Fernando wrestled with himself to
find the answer on the tip of his
tongue. But no, he couldn’t convert
and Bezer wildly lashed out at the
target with “Pietro Aronica”, much
to Fernando’s amusement (it turns
out he just named a bloke who was
an ex-University Challenge player
for Imperial).The loss of points was
no laughing matter for the expectant
crowd of loyal fans though.

Fernando also suffered a flip-
flop in these bonuses, deliberating
over “Peroxide” before settling on
“Epoxy”. It came up “Peroxide”.The
score remained at 55-40.
The old adage tells that it’s ‘a game
of two halves’ and it certainly was.
Imperial suddenly found a new
gear after Braude entered the fray,
upping the score to an 80-40 lead
with his clinically precise “Karelia”.
The music round came and went
with no points scored by anyone,
indeed with a loss of five for
Imperial after another “Premature
Bezer Buzzer” (which I am reliably
informed is a serious medical
condition).
A Feynman quote for Fernando
was counteracted by “Sudan”,
and a smattering of extra point
conversions from Nuffield brought
the scores back to a level 85-85.
Could it be any closer? No.
But then
Imperial
decided to
stop toying
with them
But then Imperial decided to stop
toying with them.
A picture round with female
political leaders, questions
surrounding dyes,and a rare flourish
from Teymur with “Slide Rule”
meant the quartet were as on fire as
Ben Fernando’s hot pink hoodie.
A celebratory dance was seen
from Fernando after he netted
“Ellipse”, and Bezer brought home
“Venus” and “Kiloparsec” before the
gong meaning the team ended on a
105 point streak. A final score of
190-85 meant another victory was
recorded and Beit Quad was duly
bouncing.
Paxman gave a damning post-
match analysis, stating to the losers
“you didn’t do so well today”. No
Jeremy, no they didn’t.
Imperial will return in their
second quarter final at somepoint.
