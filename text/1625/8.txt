Zika virus spurs global health emergency
I
n 1947, researchers uncovered
a unique virus in macaque
monkeys in the Zika Forest
in Uganda, transmittable
through the bite of infected
Aedes mosquitoes, the same ones
responsible for yellow fever and
dengue.
Almost 20 years later, the
namesake Zika virus was discovered
in a human in Nigeria. Since then,
it has been relatively rare in the
infectious diseases world, with
only a few occurrences and minor
outbreaks in Africa, South East
Asia, and Oceania. The infection
itself is fairly short and mild,
involving headaches, joint pains,
pink eye, fever, and rashes. As it has
been uncommon in humans and
symptoms generally clear up in ten
days with rest and fluids, no cure or
vaccine has been developed for it.
However, there is now a novel
outbreak since May 2015 which
has seen a sharp parallel rise in
cases of pregnant women infected
with Zika virus and microcephaly
– infants born with smaller-than-
average heads and underdeveloped
brains. Microcephaly can be
potentially fatal if brain processes
are not sufficient enough to allow
for vital life functions, and even if
they survive, they face intellectual
disability and developmental delays.
The on-going outbreak is centered
in Brazil and Latin America, with
Brazil having over 400 confirmed
cases and investigations of almost
4,000 on-going. Reports of
occurrences also extend throughout
almost all of the Americas, with
the exception of parts of Canada
and Chile where it is too cold for
the mosquito. Cases have also been
reported in Australia and Ireland of
people who have travelled to Zika-
infected locations and carried it back
with them. It can also be passed on
sexually from an infected person – a
case of such has just been reported
in Texas from someone whose
partner had travelled to Venezuela
and became infected.
In response, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) declared
a global public health emergency
on Monday, moving rapidly as a
result of previous accusations that
they were too slow to react to the
Ebola crisis. This quick action
allows governments to standardise
surveillance of new cases globally,
and to mobilise funds and research.
However, the WHO has said it
could take up to nine months to
definitively prove the link between
Zika and microcephaly, and that
it was “strongly suspected but not
scientifically confirmed”. Control
studies will start in the next two
weeks, which is important since
W
e are lucky enough
to live in the golden
age of biomedicine,
with scientists all
over the world working to find cures
for diseases affecting thousands of
people every year.
The good news is that institutions
working on biomedical research
today are provided with higher
budgets than ever before. However,
the therapies tackling these diseases
are becoming more expensive, and
subsequently accessible to only
a limited range of patients. The
solution to this problem could be
translational research.
The basic principle is that the

UK universities pair up with Big Pharma
Academia forms links with industry to try speed up application of research
knowledge generated from all these
years of research, with biomedicine
being at its zenith, should be
translated to the everyday world of
cancer,dementia or heart disease,for
example.The key behind this idea is
the relationship between academia
and industry. Most of the time,
discoveries made at universities
provide important information on
the evolution of particular diseases
and the mechanisms behind them.
Yet, in only a minority of cases
is this knowledge used to create
a cost-effective cure, available to
everybody.
A solution to this discrepancy
might come from pharmaceutical
companies themselves, which could
pay the institutions undertaking
research to tackle issues defined by
the companies, so that research can
be more effective at translating the
basic knowledge around a disease
into a potential cure.
This idea is currently being
materialised in the UK through
Imperial College London, UCL
and the University of Cambridge
working closely together with
three pharmaceutical companies,
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline
and Johnson & Johnson. Imperial
Innovations, UCL Business
and Cambridge Enterprise are
responsible for commercializing
the research of their respective
universities into knowledge that
can be used by pharmaceutical
companies to manufacture
medicines that can save anywhere
between thousands and millions of
people. The so-called £40 million
Apollo Therapeutics Fund was
announced on the 25th
of January, in
the hope of approaching these severe
diseases from an alternative, more
innovative angle that would include
research and industry working close
together towards a common goal.
The therapeutic areas of interest are
not yet fixed but they will include
research in a broad range of medical
conditions, such as asthma, cystic
fibrosis, cancer, diabetes, obesity
and Alzheimer’s. Scientists behind
this consortium believe that in this
way drugs will be produced faster
and at a lower cost. Professor James
Stirling,Provost at Imperial College
London, said: “Translating our
research into benefits for health and
society is at the core of Imperial’s
mission”. What else, other than
exciting news and discoveries could
we expect to hear when three of
the largest global pharmaceutical
companies work together with three
of the world’s top ten universities?

we know very little about the Zika
virus because of its rarity in humans.
A rapid global response by the
scientific and health community –
catalysed by the WHO’s declaration
– should let us get ahead of the
virus’ spread, which is predicted to
see four million cases by the end of
the year.
If the disease does continue to
spread and is linked to microcephaly,
it seems like one of the best options
available will also be to just eradicate
the Aedes mosquito, which was
almost successful in South America
in the 1960’s.
Still, some countries have issued
travel advisories for pregnant
women not to go to infected areas,
and even for women to avoid
getting pregnant until the end of
2017. Until we get a grasp on it,
people are otherwise advised to take
care to prevent mosquito bites and
avoid semen from individuals who
have been infected.
H
ave you ever smelled
the air in London?
Wait, stupid question.
For those who aren’t
aware, London’s air isn’t the best on
the market. Nor is the rest of the
UK’s.In fact,the UK has been found
in breach of EU regulations on air
quality in 16 zones nationwide for
the last 15 years.
It turns out, the UK’s air has been
so dirty for so long that the EU is
considering a £300 million annual
fine for the government. The affair
was described by the European
courts as “perhaps the longest
running infringement of EU law in
history.”
Around July last year, King’s
College London published a
report stating around 9,500 people
die prematurely, every year, from
Nitrous Dioxide emissions in
London alone and 29,000 in the
UK (that VW scandal didn’t help
things much). With this being the
case, and British air pollution being
amongst the worst in the EU, it’s
no wonder the government can find
substantial money, during a period
of such austerity, to combat the
issue. It looks like Newton’s First
Law applies to policy too.
The UK has just set aside £600
million, awarding £40 million of it a
few weeks ago, from now until 2020
to scrub clean our British breath.
The £40 million had been awarded
in the name of the Go Ultra Low
fund: City councils around the
UK proposed plans to increase the
uptake of electric cars in their cities
by residents, those with the best
ideas were awarded funds to push

ahead with plans.
The output of the competition was
a selection of four winning cities:
Bristol, Milton Keynes, London
and Nottingham. Here are some of
the nifty ideas as well as the changes
you Londoners can come to expect.
First off, the creation of ‘traffic
priority’ schemes for Electric
Vehicles (EVs) which allows EVs to
use bus lanes 24/7 like normal traffic
lanes, not a bad bypass. Milton
Keynes, receiving £9 million has
gone gung-ho, offering all 20,000
parking spaces, city-wide, for free to
EV users. Bristol, given £9 million,
has also opened three carpool lanes
to EV users and is building 80
free-to-use rapid charging stations
citywide. Also, it offers a four
week lease of EVs to introduce
potential buyers to their cars.
Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire
offer 13 miles of crucial bus lane,
230 charge-stations and a business
‘try before you buy scheme’.
As for London, our friends Boris
and co.will use £13 million in a plan
to convert several boroughs across
London into ‘Neighbourhoods of
the future’. This involves dozens
of roads in Hackney with street-
lighting that can charge your car.
Harrow will also be giving priority

elaboration on the figures could
either be a transparency issue or
unfounded, causing debate around
whether such minor sums of money,
on the scale of public policy, could
give a strong enough push to get us
all to go green.
When you consider the context
of this move, the plot thickens.
One needn’t be reminded that the
UK entered COP21 looking a bit
underwhelming (thanks to Amber
Rudd’s hash up). We were set to
miss targets, infringed regularly on
EU regulations and hadn’t done
much to boost renewables.
Naturally, the UK on its back
foot in Paris, signed up to the Zero
Emission Vehicles Alliance (ZEV
Alliance) which has the mission
statement: “Only zero-emissions
vehicles will be sold in the member
country by 2050.” Bold right?
One could even say, it’s the drastic
change that should ensure the UK
heads toward a greener future.
Unfortunately, just like COP21, it
wasn’t strongly binding and is more
of a support group for those who
want to make the change.This could

explain why the clean air project is
less funded than we’d expect.
A second point worth considering
is that while the government has
set aside £600 million for the clean
air program, they have been quietly
defunding councils and separate
organisations who are in charge
of keeping Britain’s air clean (i.e.
the Department of Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs giving less).
Arguably, declining air quality has
shown how useless local funding
is but still, funds for certain city
councils have been halved from
£1 million to £500 thousand and
instead they’ll have to participate in
programs such as the Go Ultra Low
fund, to have a chance of winning
them back. Meanwhile, the city
councils who can churn out clever
proposals will get the funding to go
ahead.
All might join in thinking that it’s
a step in the right direction, even
if they wish the magnitude of the
step were a bit larger. Regardless,

the meanwhile, watch out for those
