FILM
L
a Grande Bellezza
(The Great Beauty),
was undoubtedly a
masterpiece. Filled with
art and symbolism, it left us in awe,
as Italian director Paolo Sorrentino
reflected upon life and death. This
is partly why Youth is so widely
anticipated, and also why it has
received merely good or average
reviews. Youth, however, although
contemplating similar themes, is
different in the sense that it was
never intended to be as extravagant.
Instead, Sorrentino aims for a
lighter, more straight-forward,
simple film. And that’s what most
have failed to realise. In the end,
Sorrentino’s touching tragicomedy,
accompanied by virtuoso acting,
deserves more praise than it has
thus far received.
Youth is set in an Alpine luxury
hotel & spa, surrounded by breath-
taking scenery, where retired
composer Fred Ballinger (Michael
Caine), best remembered for his
Simple Songs, is spending his
summer vacation with best friend
Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) and
daughter-assistant Lena (Rachel
Weisz). Fred, fantastically portrayed
by Michael Caine, is an apathetic,
somewhat cynical old man who
avoids any emotional contact,
leading his daughter to resent him.
Fred thinks that "emotions are
overrated," preferring to express
himself through his music.Later-on
in the film however, a more tender
side of Fred is progressively revealed:
someone who cares deeply for his
daughter, largely appreciates Mick’s
friendship, and, most significantly,
who terribly, desperately misses
his wife, Melanie, ceasing to find
meaning in life without her.
Mick, on the other hand, is more
sensitive. A widely recognised, but
now washed-up film director, he is
in the process of writing his final
work. His "sentimental, intellectual
and moral testament" as he puts
it, the quite symbolically-titled:
Life’s Last Day. Mick is writing
the film for his old friend, who
he greatly admires: Brenda Morel
(Jane Fonda). Brenda appears in
arresting cameos, reminding us
what a legendary cinema figure Jane
Fonda is. Rachel Weisz also gives an
amazing performance; her character,
Lena Ballinger, is married to Mick’s
son, who leaves her for… Paloma
Faith, playing a caricature of herself.

Repeated
patterns are
beautifully
orchestrated
by
Sorrentino
Youth is a masterful reflection of old age
Paolo Sorrentino’s touching tragicomedy deserves more praise than it has recieved
questionable success. Here, Paloma
Faith’s presence, criticised for being
shallow and devoid of any meaning,
is intended to mock today’s popular
culture and succeeds in doing so.
In the hotel, Fred also meets
and befriends Paul Dano’s Jimmy
Tree, a young actor from California
who – much to his discontent – is
most famous for his portrayal of
the robot ‘Mr Q’. Jimmy seems
tired with fame and the Hollywood
actor lifestyle that comes with it.
He wants his acting to have a real
impact on the world.
The film begins with a slowly
evolving plot, including amusing
sarcastic casual dialogues between
Caine and Keitel. A satirical touch
is also present, like in the numerous
scenes featuring an overweight
portrayal of Argentinian footballer
Diego Maradona. Surreal and
visually indulging interventions,
common for Sorrentino, frequently
interrupt the plot, such as when
Fred ‘directs’ a herd of cows in an
idyllic Swiss scenery.
This light atmosphere gradually
develops over a number of fore-
shadowings and repeated patterns,
beautifully orchestrated by
Sorrentino, to reach a plot-twisting
climax of highly unexpected and
tragic events. All building-up to an
overwhelming finale, for which the
audienceisbeingprimedthroughout
the film. Fellini-esque scenes, never
absent from Sorrentino’s work,
also get their moments, the most
characteristic being when Mick
imagines a meadow full of his
female protagonists; all performing
their roles at the same time,it shows
the great impact all these women
had in his life, even though he never
came to fully understand them.
Overall – overlooking the
Paloma Faith moments – Youth is
accompanied by music that fits well
to its atmosphere; David Lang, with
whom Sorrentino has previously
collaborated in The Great Beauty,
has created a wonderful, fittingly-
simple, classical music score.
The first time the film’s title
appears on screen,ironically enough,
it flashes in front of a perfect row
of semi-naked elderly women
marching towards the hotel’s sauna.
This scene emits right from the
start a feeling of doom, associated
with old age. Ultimately, Youth has a
pessimistic outlook on growing old,
or rather, a deeply realistic one; it is
about aging and the losses that come
with it. The loss of a loved one, the
loss of memory, the loss of purpose
in life, the loss of enthusiasm and
talent. The heaviness of a dull daily
I
t’s remarkable how much can
be forgiven when you have
a good story. Stylistic flaws
can be almost completely
forgotten about – when I think
about The Lord of the Rings novels,
it’s not Tolkien’s endless stream of
minute details that I remember, but
the epic quest of Frodo, Sam, and
the rest of the Fellowship through
Middle Earth. It’s rare enough that
a film with a truly gripping story
(true or otherwise) arrives, and so
when it does, it may get more praise
and attention than it deserves as a
whole.
Spotlight is just such a film,
although it has quite the opposite
flaw that Tolkien’s work does,
being almost devoid of any stylistic
flourish whatsoever. The soundtrack
is bland,the cinematography – while
crystal-clear – is largely devoid of
any beauty or technical proficiency,
and with only a few exceptions
(Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber
come to mind),the performances are
probably best described as "solid" –
not necessarily a bad thing, but not
really a good thing either (can you
tell I’m bitter that this film beat
The Big Short to the Screen Actors’
Guild Award for Best Performance
By A Cast In A Motion Picture?).
But what Spotlight does have going

routine.It is about the lustful craving
of missed sexual experiences, the
wasting of youth, and the nostalgia
and melancholy associated with
old age, the latter being beautifully
summed up in Mick’s dialogue with
his female screenplay co-writer, as
she takes a look through both ends
of a telescope: "This is what you see
when you’re young – everything
seems really close: that’s the future;
and now… that’s what you see when
you’re old – everything seems really
far away: that’s the past".
Youth is also about simplicity, as
Fred’s ‘Simple Songs’ reveal; easy
to play, they are performed by only
a small section of the orchestra.
Nevertheless, as a young boy in
the hotel points out to Fred, they
are "not only simple, but really
beautiful" too. With the loss of
youth comes this appreciation of
the simple moments in life that
should have been cherished more.
For Fred one of them is his wife
Melanie; as he says, besides all
they had been through, they liked
to think of themselves ‘as a simple
song’. We come to the realisation
that emotions are everything but
overrated; according to Mick, they
are "all we’ve got", and by the end,
Fred finally gives in to them, giving
the film it's perfect ending.

for it is a good story – a true one at
that – that is well told by a brilliant
script. It tells of the uncovering of
the child molestation rife within
the Catholic church, and the effect
it had on its victims, by the four-
man Spotlight investigative team of
the Boston Globe (Ruffalo, Michael
Keaton,RachelMcAdamsandBrian
D’Arcy James), as well as their new,
quietly brilliant boss (Schreiber).
They begin as underdogs facing a
giant of a system; as the plot pulses
along, more victims are found, more
dead ends are hit,and the rottenness
of it all becomes more and more
clear.
The handful of truly excellent
moments in the film arrive,
unsurprisingly, when a glitter
of craftsmanship appears in the
filmmaking – scenes like the single
moving shot in which D’Arcy
James’s character walks from his
front door for less than fifty metres
in the dead of night to find himself
right in front of a rehab centre
for child-molesting priests, or a
heartbreaking sequence in which
the sound of children singing ‘Silent
Night’ at a carol service is intercut
with shots of the victims breaking
down as the Spotlight team question
them. While I don’t think the
film deserves anywhere near the
amount of recognition it’s getting
(the nominations of McAdams
for supporting actress and director
Tom McCarthy by the Oscars are
just baffling to me), Spotlight is that
rare film worth seeing for, and made
enjoyable by, the strength of its
subject matter alone.

We Come as Friends
Dir: Hubert Saper Script: Hubert
Saper 110 minutes.
A
fter more than a decade
away, director Hubert
Sauper has returned
with We Come as Friends,
a troubling, immensely powerful
look at South Sudan, the ‘World’s
newest country,’ whose post-
independence existence has been
blighted by violence. A looping,
experimental documentary, We
Come as Friends draws links between
the historical colonialism practiced
by the French and the British, and
the ‘new colonialism,’represented by
a steady stream of Chinese investors
and Western interventionists.
Coming out of a 22-year long
civil war, and a referendum that
saw an overwhelming majority
opting for independence, South
Sudan emerged in 2011 with a
sense of hope and joy. But such
aspirations have since turned sour:
Chinese investors have moved into
the territory, erecting US-designed
oil rigs; the fertile country attracts
numerous foreign businesses; and
American missionaries joyfully
declare South Sudan ‘a new Texas’.
Sauper creates a mosaic of
uneasy scenes; there is no narrative
voiceover, but the gaps create
their own story. It is rare to find a
scene in the film where some form
of background happening is not
relevant: in one, white peacekeepers
drink in the new year while a black
employee in overalls gathers water;
two scenes feature televisions
playing interviews with Hillary
Clinton – one from 2009 in which
she refers to Africa as ‘the world’s
breadbasket’, and one from 2012
where she exploits the legacy of
Western colonialism as a weapon
against the Chinese.
The civil war has simply continued,
with guns and knives replaced by
diplomacy and land-agreements.
Imperialism leaves behind what
Frantz Fanon called ‘germs of rot,’
and has re-emerged as a postmodern
scramble for Africa. With a style
that calls to mind the non-linear
films of Adam Curtis, We Come
as Friends is a vitally-important,
beguilingly-strange call to arms for
all those who reject oppression.

Innocence of Memories
Dir: Grant Gee. Script: Grant Gee,
Orhan Pamuk. Starring: Pandora
Colin, Mehmet Ergen. 97 minutes.
N
obody has written more
on the changing face of
Istanbul than Nobel-
winning author Orhan
Pamuk. Born in 1952, Pamuk
has witnessed an explosion of
population, which has seen Istanbul
swell to 14 million inhabitants,
making it the largest city in Europe.
And perhaps no book of Pamuk’s
better represents his love of the city
than The Museum of Innocence,which
recounts a love story over nine years.
Following its publication, Pamuk
created an actual museum, which
claims to display objects from the
characters’lives,while also exploring
Upper-class life in Istanbul.
This sense of meta-narrative fits
in well with the concept for Grant
Gee’s documentary Innocence of
Memories, in which a camera roams
the streets of Istanbul, and a ‘friend’
of the main character of the novel
recounts the plot of the book.
Drawing on Walter Benjamin’s
concept of the flaneur, we are
treated to a nightime walk around
Istanbul, occasionally happening
on TVs showing interviews with
Pamuk himself, giving us a sense of
voyeur-like pleasure. At one point,
Pamuk states that "the hero of the
novel I’m just finishing is a man
who continuously walk" with a glint
of delicious irony. As memories of
a lived-in city pile up, the screen
becomes hazy and opaque, obscured
by layers of gauze-like shots.
While I don’t know whether the
film would be appealing to someone
who is familiar with Pamuk’s work
– especially since the film seems to
just repeat the plot of The Museum
of Innocence – those looking for a
gentle,beautifully-shot introduction
to the scribe of Istanbul could do a
lot worse
