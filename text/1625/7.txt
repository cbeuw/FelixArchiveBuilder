Rhodes must fall

L
ast week Oriel College,
Oxford confirmed
that a monument
commemorating Cecil
Rhodes, a 19th
century British
imperialist, would remain despite
a massive movement by students
seeking the removal of the statue.
Like many of the students at
Oxford University,I’m disappointed
by the college’s decision which goes
against the views of the university’s
student union. Rhodes must fall,
and be moved to a more suitable
location – the dark and dusty corner
of a museum.
Our universities and society are in
dire need of decolonisation. And I
don’t think Oriel College’s decision
to keep the statue of Rhodes in
place while adding what it calls
“clear historical context to explain
why it is there” goes far enough.
Cecil Rhodes was a tyrant and
a racist, exploiting the people
of southern Africa through
the operations of the British

do that by

South Africa Company. Those
immortalised in stone are usually
the heroes or innovators of our past.
In hindsight, Rhodes represents the
worst of the British empire and by
removing the statue we can begin
to reconcile ourselves with our
country’s dark past.
Some have argued that as a
historical artefact, removing his
likeness is an attempt to “cleanse
history.” What it will actually do
is “recontextualise iconography
celebrating grave injustice,” moving
and presenting it in a way which
fully condemns Rhodes’ actions.
We should be remembering the
millions of victims of the British
empire – those who our ancestors
killed and enslaved around the word
– not the man who subjugated them.
And we can do that by erecting
a statue of those he exploited as a
replacement.
It’s interesting that so many have
come out to attack the Rhodes Must
Fall campaign. The university’s
chancellor, Lord Patten, suggested
that students with such views
“should think about being educated
elsewhere”, and Harry Mount,
writing for The Daily Telegraph
(always the voice of reason),
described the students taking part
in the movement as “a generation
raised to believe that their feelings
are all that matter”.The real problem
is their generation; they seem happy
for institutional racism to remain.
Unfortunately, the reaction to
Rhodes Must Fall is part of a
greater problem – Britons are not
educated about our colonial past. A
recent survey by YouGov revealed
that a staggering 59% thought the
British Empire was something to be
proud of. Only 19% said they were
ashamed. On the empire’s legacy,
49% said countries were better
off colonised compared with 15%
believing that they were worse off.
It seems that Britain is a nation

of imperial apologists. We should
not celebrate the instability we have
left behind, destroying once proud
nations for our own economic gain.
Britain needs to wake up to the
fact that the world still continues to
suffer from the consequences of the
colonial project. By promoting the
voices and stories of the oppressed,
we can begin to make amends and
make students feel welcome at their
own university.
Maybe Imperial could start by
changing it’s name to something
that isn’t a daily reminder of our
colonial past.
The greatest crime in human history
As an intelligent species, we should recognise that eating meat is not natural

o. If you guessed by
reading the title that I
was going to say warfare,
you are wrong. Poverty?
We built that ourselves.Famine? Yet
another consequence of capitalism.
The Holocaust? Although a stigma
that will forever stain the history of
mankind, it did not sustain itself for
relatively long. Inquisition? Read
the previous. What about, say, the
food industry? And moreover, the
carnivorous food industry?
Yes, that’s right: mass-slaughter
of animals. As much as meat eaters
may use the excuse, “Oh no, but we
are higher up the food chain and
some animals eat others as means
of feeding” as an argument, this is
an altogether fallacious one. You
see, we as humans should have –
and in fact it is this very capability
that supposedly distinguishes us
from the rest of faunal species –
intelligence.
Intelligence allows us to discern
the good from bad, the right
from wrong, happy from sad, and
ultimately have mercy – or at least
pity – for those in pain. Indeed, it
is natural for animals to eat other
animals but since when did it
become natural to inhibit millions of
animals from having their freedom
by confining them in cells awaiting
their unquestioned demise?
Pigs are desperately squealing,
cows violently writhing, chicken
being forced to lay unnatural
amountsofeggs,duckshavingastick
jammed in their throats and still
there are a handful of shareholders
profiting from it. And it is from
death that they profit. Insofar as
laws concern, this is legal under
every constitution even despite
how many non-governmental
organisations and activist groups
lobby against it. It may well be legal,
but essentially lacks the most basic
of ethics: humanity. Ah, but when
it comes to a cute puppy everyone
feels empathy and is softened just by
looking at a photoshopped picture.
Sadly, there is no stopping this
force given that it has gained too
much inertia by today. Meat is now
a staple in everyone’s diet and is even
entrained within different cultures.
By opting to be a vegetarian, one’s
conscience may remain clean but
this does not stop the ruthless
consumerism of the society as a
whole. Perhaps a good way to part-
solve the problem would be to,at the
very least, let these animals live in
a somewhat “natural” environment
and use less violent methods (some
sort of short life drug) to butcher
them. And of course, decrease the
volume of the overall industry by a
great deal.
Photographers have a right to capture

t was 3pm on a cold Saturday
in January. On location at
Alexandra Palace, a beautiful
old building atop a hill
overlooking the London skyline
in all its splendour. Two friends of
mine are dressed up for an urban
photoshoot, and I’m focussed on
the viewfinder, trying to nail the
perfect shot. Assistants are holding
reflectors and various bits of
equipment, perfecting the lighting.
Composition, check. Lighting,
check. Camera, check. *Click*….
shot captured. I’m getting ready to
take the next picture…
Out of the corner of my eye, a
yellow clad security guard shuffles
along purposefully, radio in hand.
The whole group lets out a collective
sigh; we all know the conversation
that’s about to take place.
“Have you got a permit for
photography here?”
“Nope we’re just some student
friends taking photos in a public
area, for non-commercial purposes
only. Is there a problem?”
“Well you need to have a permit to
photograph in this area, I’m afraid
you’ll have to leave, Sir.”
This was the third time on
that particular day I’d had that
conversation, and frankly I’m sick
and tired of it. Over my six years
of serious photography I’ve lost
count of the number of times
I’ve been stopped, including in
Canary Wharf, Greenwich Park
and Westminster Station. I’ve been
told not to use a tripod, not to take
pictures of entrances or simply
to move elsewhere or risk being
arrested. In planning alone for
my latest photoshoot, I spent the
best part of a month searching for
appropriate locations and seeking
permission; this was ultimately
fruitless given how quickly we were
told to leave multiple sites. The
creative vision was there, I had the
equipment ready, the models were
willing to take part; but all was at
strong risk of being jeopardised for
lack of an appropriate backdrop.
I should clarify that legally, all of
the locations that we were stopped
in were private property, and thus
the security teams had official rights
to stop us. However, as we all know,
with rights come responsibility, and
the indiscriminate and accusative
behaviour demonstrated by the
guards and their superiors is an
abuse of this right.
I, along with the vast majority
of photographers, are socially
responsible. We avoid blocking
entrances, scaring wildlife or taking
photos of children without their
parent’s permission. It therefore
appears incongruous that we
should be subject to photographic
restrictions in places which have
public access,such as Canary Wharf
and Alexandra Palace, since we are
not harming anyone nor causing
damage. perhaps if these security
guards had read J.S Mill’s ‘On
Liberty’, we’d be better off.
The fact remains that these
restrictions and impositions are
threatening our creativity and
placing boundaries against our
imagination and ability to express
ourselves. Numerous times I have
seen a perfect photo opportunity
– perfect lighting upon a sign or
colours within a shop – but have
thought twice of taking my camera
out on seeing a guard in the corner
of my eye.
Of course, it was all a lot easier
fifty years ago. Back before the
threats of Islamist or IRA terrorism,
and when Downing Street was
open to the public, photography
was seen as a benign pastime, and
candid images of everyday life were
perfectly acceptable. Henri Cartier-
Bresson, considered the father of
street photography, talked about
the importance of capturing “the
decisive moment” to maintain and
express a memory in a shot. He
took images in streets and stations,
of children playing and adults going
about their daily lives.This approach
seems hollow and idealistic in a

world where taking photos such as
his “Derriere la Gare Saint-Lazare”
could allow him to be stopped under
Section 43 of the Terrorism Act.
Even more worryingly, in July
2015, the European Parliament
voted on the Right to Panorama,
an outrageous law which could have
classified skyline and building views
as copyrighted and thus illegal to
sell without permission. Thankfully
this law was defeated in parliament,
but indicates the absurd lengths to
which our right to photography is
under attack. Public access should
be able to be captured by the public
in all forms; we have no say in
the skyscrapers that make up our
skylines, but are somehow expected
to defer to their owners when it
comes to imaging that which we see
around us.
Too many photo opportunities are ruined by
unnecessary regulations
Nevertheless, London’s youth
creative scene is booming. Having
been fortunate enough to collaborate
with photographers, musicians,
models and stylists from all over the
capital, I am convinced of the sheer
talent out there. Young people are
excited to be making creative media
and expressing their opinions of
the world around them. But talent
needs to be nurtured, encouraged
and shared; I fear that these onerous,
tiring and baseless restrictions
imposed upon us by society will
simply cause our creativity to fade
away. It is this that will be the real
tragedy – not the taking of photos
in public access but privately owned
land.
