Football Thirds
IC started confidently, pushing forward and
forcing Royal Holloway into a totally
offensive game. After persistant attacks, we
finally scored. A move down the right which
was finally hammered in from the edge of the
box by Flanagan. Shortly afterward, Royal
Holloway had their first attack which ended in
a hotly disputed panalty; after this goal
we pushed forward again. A sparkling run by
Rimmer and a thundering shot left Royal
Holloway trailing. After more pressure from
IC, we forced a corner and Hendy turned in a
flash and forced the ball home.
After the change and against the wind IC
fought courageously, but the wind aided
Royal Holloway to a second goal, the ball
ballooning over our unlucky keeper into the
net.
From the kick-off we forced RHC back and
eventually after several near misses Rimmer
scored his second. From then on the football
flowed end to end. With four minutes to go,
RHC scored two quick goals and scraped a
point. A good team performance by us,
Rugby Seconds
IC SECONDS started well thanks to another
fine warm up session from Mr Hall. However,
it soon became apparent that St Thomas's
were using the game to test out a previously
untried referee. Offside laws, and indeed most
other laws were disregarded, but fortunately
the match was still played in good (if illegal)
spirit.
St Thomas's opened the account after
twenty minutes. A long kick through was
touched down by fullback John Symes,
although the referee deciding otherwise,
awarded St Thomas's a try. An emminently
charitable fellow.
The try was converted and followed by
another quick score to make IC 0-10 down at
half-time. The second half was a dour
struggle amongst the forwards. Any attempt
by either side to spin the ball was foiled by
blatantly offside defences. St Thomas's
finally scored a third try ten minutes from the
end following a maul on IC's try-line.
A frustrating game, with sound perform-
ances put in by the aforementioned fullback
and the whole of the pack. A big hot bath and
a good meal afterwards soon warmed away
the diappointment of what should have been
an enjoyable game.
TEAM: Symes, Chan, Pike, Wall, Nkandu,
Hughes-Narborough, Bishop, Davies, Toole,
Hall, Verity, Hodgson, Bell, Ball, Kirby.
