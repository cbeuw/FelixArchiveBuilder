24-HOUR
CASHTILLTO
PAY FOR
THEM.
To pay for most 24-hour
services you need 24-hour
C c i s h
The NatWest SERVICETILL
provides exactly that.
It's called a SERVICETILL
because it not only offers you
cash, it will, if you wish, send
an up-to-date statement of
your account or a new
chequebook. During the
working day, you can even
get a check on your balance
on the spot.
Why don't you askforde-
tails at your nearest NatWest
branch?
The NatWest SERVICETILL.
You can make it work all
hours for your money
