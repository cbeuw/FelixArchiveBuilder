Football Fifths
ON Wednesday at Harlington the fifths
maintained their 100% record with a fine
fighting display against a very lively Mines
team. Twice in the match Mines fought back
to only one goal behind only to be thwarted
by further goals from the fifths as they
showed their real character.
From the start the fifths were kicking with
an almost gale force wind behind them,
putting Mines under continuous pressure.
The first goal came when Kelly fed Healy on
the edge of the six-yard box, who made no
mistake. Dave Hardy outpaced the Mines
defence and crossed to the far post for John
Healy to nod home the second goal. When
Mines pulled a second goal back, IC went
back on the rampage and Archer restored the
two goal lead with a low, well placed shot
following a Baldwin corner.
In the second half Mines started to look
more dangerous and fifths ace defender Al
Cable came into his own, making a stream of
hard, resolute, but fair tackles at the centre of
the defence. When Mines did score due to a
Brown-Gohil combination, the fifths showed
their character by launching somespectacular
attacks on the Mines goal which resulted in
Healy slotting home. Minutes later Archer
was chopped in the penalty area following a
good run and Teaham made no mistake from
the spot.
At the end of the game all credit had to be
given to Mines seconds who are the first team
this season to extend the fifths.
T E A M : Brown, Audin, Gohil, Teaham,
Cable, Morris, Archer, Kelly, Hardy, Healy,
Baldwin.

Hockey Seconds
ON an otherwise unsuccessful day for IC
Hockey, the 2nds extended their winning run
to four matches, in a game which produced
the most satisfactory result of the season so
far.
Complacent after last week's 13-0 victory,
IC allowed Sonning to control the first half
and at the break IC were 2-0 down.
The second half was however, entirely
different, and aggressive play soon led to a
goal that brought us back into the game. A
long run down the right wing by Andy Garms
led to a telling cross which was neatly swept
into the goal by Ahmeet Rao. Soon after, a
shot was stopped on the line by a foot, and
the ensuing penalty was competently
converted by Mike Chew, thus maintaining
his record of scoring in every game.
The decider came when the ball found Phil
Webb free in the area and it was a simple job
for him to chip it past the goalkeeper. IC were
unlucky not to go further into the lead when a
fourth goal was disallowed, but Sonning
couldn't get back into the game.
TEAM: Jones, Parker, Bird, Rogers, Masom
(Capt), Chew, Rao, Stroomer, Garms, Gray,
Webb, Shaw.
Hockey Thirds
OUR undefeated away record remained
intact after our fifth successive fixture at
Harlington. The loss of two captains (Tim and
Phil) in three days led to this week's superior
organisation off the field. However, the
importance of these two superstars (nay
demigods) on the field was sorely realised.
IC conceded two early goals before coming
to life. Steadily creating chances through the
first half, we finally scored immediately after
the restart, through Dave Cornwell. An evenly
fought second half ended with the match
being settled by the ball being hammered
over IC's goal line.
Impressive debuts by Caroline Brown and
Johnson Afilaka were so much appreciated
that they may be recalled.
Fortunately honour was restored after the
game, with a 5-3 victory at table-football.
We're at home again tomorrow lads, in case
you hadn't guessed.
TEAM: Hutchings, Pound, Leinster, Purdy,
Clift (Capt), C Brown, Cornwell, Afilaka,
Wylie, Taylor, Benham. U m p i r e : Rob
Morgan.
So where's
all these
photos then?
Cross-country
ON SATURDAY a squad of four set out for
Guildford for the Stag Hill Road Relay. The
race comprised of 6 x 1.7 mile circuits of the
Surrey University site. Gary Longhurst set the
fastest IC time on the first leg and also ran the
fifth leg only 30 sees slower. The team came
15th out of 40. Barrett, Hayward and Thwaites
all produced good sub-10 min times. The next
event is November'26: the 3rd London
Colleges' league race.
Snooker
I REGRET to announce that it is unlikely
that the Snooker club will be getting a
third snooker table this year. Our claim
was referred to Council at last week's UFC
meeting which has ruined our chances for
this year.
The 'B' team managed to take one frame
from the ' C team last Wednesday in an
unexpected 4-1 defeat. The A team lost one
frame against L S E B team. C Tripp was
blamed for this when he lost for the first time.
Sailing
ON SATURDAY, IC Sailing team travelled to
Reading for their first league match of the
season. The sailing took place on the River
Thames, which is only about 40 yards wide at
this point, and the fluctuating winds and river
current made conditions very difficult.
In the first race positions were changing
constantly, but at the finish Reading took 1st,
4th, and 5th to win. However, Dave Chadwick
was involved in a collision, and with Reading
failing to take penalty points, a protest was
lodged.
In race 2, IC led, but the wind dropped, and
they eventually finished 2nd, 3rd, and 6th
giving Reading the race,
the complex protest situation, and this time
IC lead from the start, and won easily with 1st,
2nd and 4th positions.
The third, deciding race, was very close
with IC 1st, 3rd and 5th after the first leg, but
again were caught out by the current, and
Reading won the race.
This gave Reading the match by 2 to 1,
although the IC team sailed very well, and
were unlucky not to win.
T E A M : Murray, Butler, Kennedy, Young-
husband, Chadwick, Redman.
