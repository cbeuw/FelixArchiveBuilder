China. I can only assume that the
considerable degree of literary
licence used in this regard was
intended to be ironical.
However, if vnu were deter-
mined to adopt a racist attitude
towards the incident, it would
have been more correct to
describe it as the Black Hong of
Kong. Your article has been
misunderstood by some people
who I am sure you did not mean
to hurt. I feel it necessary to say
that no mainland Chinese were
involved.

Dear Mr Marshall
I am writing to protest against
what I regard as misuse of your
position as Editor of F E L I X in
the recent controversy with Dare
Afolabi. In particular, I am
appalled by the three cartoons in
the last issue which accompanied
any reference to him. It is
notoriously difficult to know
quite where to draw the line
concerning the racist, sexist
(etc.) content of cartoons, but it
seems to me that you have opted
to use any tactics, including
outright racism to discredit Dare.
Even the fact that he isn't the
proud owner of a traditional
British name like Dennis or
Desmond is used against him.
A n y o n e who has had any
contact at all with Dare will
know that phrases like " a
compulsive liar of the most
detestable kind", "crackpot", or
"jerk" don't fit at all. I suspect
that it is the fact that he is
Chairman of African and Car-
ibbean Society which has become
active on issues like South Africa,
racism and overseas students,
and is actually trying to do
somthing within College that has
attracted your detestation.
I ask for an apology for your
treatment of the argument;
especially for the three cartoons
printed in F E L I X last week.
Tours sincerely

Dear Mr Sieve Marshall
I must observe that the article
on page ten of last week's
F E L I X , concerning Dare Afolabi
and its accompanying cartoons on
pages One, ten and eleven were in
very bad taste.
The cartoons, Stanley, are
distinctly racist and imply that
the black students in College are
of doubtful character and have
ganged up to harass some white
person. Incidentally, Sam, is the
person represented as being
harassed supposed to be M r
Williams or you? If the latter,
there is no hope yet. (I bet you
didn't understand that.) In
addition, the letter directly
insults M r Afolabi, who was
referred to as a 'jerk'.
Lastly, Sidney, I want to
comment that your editorship, in
my opinion, has given F E L I X a
racist feel, what with the Kosher
Gown and Gang of Three story. I
hence look forward to next year
and a different sort of F E L I X .

Sir
Your present campaign against
Dare Afolabi is disgraceful. Some
of the things you have done in the
course bf it are tantamount to
suggesting that he is not only a
"compulsive liar of the most
detestable kind", but a negro as
well! Both these charges are as
unjustified as they are scand-
alous. M i n d you, I couldn't
help laughing.

Dear Sir
The impression I got from BB
Wolffe's column last week is that
Gay News is b o u g h t f r o m
funds allocated to H a l d a n e
Library, and not by members of
Gay Soc. The African-Caribbean
Society, on the other hand, is
being asked to buy copies of
West Indian World a n d
send them to the H a l d a n e
Library to be "kindly" displayed.
West Indian World is a newspaper
read mainly by British blacksjust
as Gay News is read by British
gays. If it is accepted that blacks
ang gays are minorities, is it not
only fair that the same set of rules
be made to apply to both groups?
In any case, the one-sided
treatment given to such an
important issue by your columnist
is most irresponsible. Instead of
serving as a forum for healthy
discussion, F E L I X is now being
used as a vehicle for spreading
the private prejudices of a few.

Sir
Like many other people, I am
amused by the current misunder-
standing between yourself and
that upstart Dare Afolabi.
I should like to remind people
that the whole affair began when
you kindly decided to include in
the Freshers' Issue four para-
graphs (c 350 words, compared
with 36 words for the Latin
American Soc) of an article on
the Afro-Carib Soc. This was
unnecessary anyway, as there
already was an introduction to
that society in the Handbook.
Afolabi started to complain and
has c o n t i n u e d to do so ad
nauseam.
I suggest that he would make a
lot of people happier if he
refrained from nit-picking in the
pages of F E L I X .
As he seems interested in legal
phrases I will remind him of
Cicero's well known dictum:
"Salus populi suprema est lex".

Dear Mr Marshall
Page ten of last week's F E L I X
reads more like an extract from a
National Front paper. Racially
motivated derogatory references
and cartoons were made about
one "Dennis" or "Diogenes" by
BB Wolffe. In view of the usual
cry for racial harmony in this
society may I ask why BB Wolffe
did his piece. O r is he saying that
the cries are crocodile's tears?
If BB Wolffe wasn't up to some
mischief he could have made or
proved a point against Dare
Afolabi other than resort to
irrelevant cartoons. What is it
that m a d e " D e n n i s " the
"Menace"? O r is BB Wolffe's
piece simply in keeping with the
attitudes of his type that the
minority who demand a right or
make enquiries constitute a
menace or swamp the society?
Dare and the Haldane Librarian
and others concerned were still
engaged in discussions on the
enquiries Dare made about the
absence of African ''Caribbean
journals from the Library when
BB Wolffe took it upon himself
to sentence Dare to monkey-like
menace in cartoons.
BB Wolffe had better make his
position clear. He is, of course,
entitled to his opinion, but he is
not entitled to make the student
newspaper an organ of racial
disharmony. It is relevant to
mention here that the Dare-
F E L I X series started when the
E d i t o r M a r s h a l l deleted a
paragraph on South Africa from
an article submitted by Dare
Afolabi, the A f r o - C a r i b b e a n
President, for the first issue of
F E L I X this year. May we under-
stand that F E L I X is to serve
students positively and not
negatively.
