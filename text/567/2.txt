Dear Steve
In last week's F E L I X there
was an article about a Guilds
Fireworks night last Wednesday.
The fireworks night was in fact
a Mines/Guilds event. Although
we helped on the night, Mines
did most of the organising and
ran the Barbeque. We congratu-
late them on a "stonking" event.
We'd also like to thank Chris
Halls, warden of Beit Hall, for all
of his help.

Dear Steve
We are writing in response to
an article in the Liberal Society
magazine, Forward, in which M r
Stephen Goulder describes the
City and Guilds Union elections
as "anachronistic", he criticizes
in particular the stand-down
procedure and the non-use of a
departmental ballot or the Single
Transferable vote system.
Last year the election procedure
in Guilds was reviewed at length.
After many discussions it was
decided to hold the elections by
paper ballot at a Hustings U G M ,
and that stand-downs would be
permissible within the " t o p
three".
Surely M r Goulder must agree
that it is very important for
people to know something about
the candidates in an election.
City and Guilds Union believes
that all students who wish to vote
should attend the hustings
U G M . If the voting did not take
place at the U G M , the attendance
would drop considerably. Part of
the attraction of the G u i l d s
elections is the fact that the
results are announced at the
Union Meeting, this would not
be possible if we used the Single
Transferable Vote system.
A p p r o x i m a t e l y 550 people
attended last year's G u i l d s
Election U G M , rather higher
proportionally than the atten-
dance at the I C U Hustings. We
would also like to point out that
R C S U , who run their elections
by departmental ballot box, had
less people voting than Guilds
had at the Election U G M . Can
the Guilds elections really be
classed as unrepresentative?
M r Goulder also attacked the
stand-down procedure. In the
Guilds elections a Presidential
candidate may stand-down to
V P or Hon Sec, and a candidate
for V P may stand-down to Hon
Sec. There are certain qualities
common to the top three posts,
and any worthwhile candidate
would only stand-down if he
thought he was capable of doing
the job well.
Whilst always welcoming
criticism and discussion, we feel
that either M r G o u l d e r is
ignoring the laets, or he doesn't
know them. Perhaps he should
research his subject a little more
fully before putting his views into
print.

Last Wednesday at Hariington
a member of Guilds 2nd X V
( M a r k Wilkins) was injured
playing rugby.
On seeing that he was breathing
irregularly, incapable of speech
and unable to move, we decided
not to move him but to send for
help.
As there was no one in the
sports centre, capable of first aid,
we called for an ambulance.
Mark was subsequently found to
have concussion and was released
that night.
The point is this: Mark could
have been very seriously injured;
spinal i n j u r y , for example.
Similar accidents could occur at
any time, and not just in a rugby
match. Yet at the time there was
no first aid trained personnel at
Hariington.
Two years ago, a member of
R C S Rugby suffered a compound
fracture playing against Hollo-
way, again at Hariington. He
had to wait a quarter of an hour
for an ambulance.
Last year a football player
damaged his knee — same result.
A member of Guilds rugby raised
the first-aid problem with Roger
Stotesbury, to no apparent result.
Isn't it about time something
was done?

Dear Steve
Ever since I've been at IC I've
been under the impression that
the s p i r i t of g o o d w i l l was
overflowing. So, last Thursday
evening I decided to test it out by
leaving my wallet on top of the
Space Invaders machine (all
right I admit I play Space
Invaders). I even tried to make it
harder by leaving all of £5 and an
expired Barlcaycard/Barclay-
bank card inside, not to mention
loads of personal addresses,
telephone numbers, etc., so
convinced was I that I'd get it
back the next day. Well, 'twas
not to be and I must say I'm
dismayed. It's now M o n d a y
afternoon and not a whisper of a
boomeranging wallet! Well, could
you blame him/her, who was to
know except me!
So please, if you've got my
wallet just get it back to me
(minus cash if absolutely neces-
sary). If not for me, for the sake of
my friends whom I won't be able
to contact again (sob, sob). This
is a plea!
Gimme back my wallet . . . please.
Ta very much

Dear Sir
I have been asked by the
Gaelic Football Club to write to
yourself concerning the letter by
one T i m Latham regarding his
ill-informed notion that there are
no Gaelic football teams, pitches
or referees within 300 miles of
London.
I would like to point out that
Gaelic football is organised in
London, Hertfordshire, War-
wickshire, L a n c a s h i r e , a n d
Yorkshire. In London there are
three football leagues, each with
about twenty teams, apart from
the hurling, camogie and hand-
ball leagues, which are also
played.
London as a 'county' enters
teams i n the A l l - I r e l a n d
Championships every year and
the game in London has flourished
to such an extent that a large
number of those now playing
regularly are English-born.
However much people such as
the said Latham say that the
organising of a Gaelic football
team is a joke, it is my feeling and
that of several others that it is less
obscure than many of the sports
played around College and that a
College of our size could easily
support a decent Gaelic team.
We are the first College in
London who have tried to set one
up.
I am at present in contact with
the Gaelic Athletic Association to
try to get affiliation and I hope to
have arranged a few friendly
matches either just before or just
after Christmas. If anyone is
interested and has not contacted
me could they please do so via
the Union Office.

Dear Mr Marshall,
In the spring term of last year,
we (the undersigned) were living
in room 19, Garden Hall when a
rather amusing incident occured.
During the sabbatical election
campaign we received a personal
visit from M r Passmore. He gave
a copy of his election manifesto to
each of us. Our Greek roommate
looked at his momentarily and
then screwed it up and threw it in
the bin. (We have been assured
that no insult was intended and
he only did it as a joke.)
M r Passmore was not amused!
He told us all quite firmly that
each sheet cost him V 2 p to print,
and that he had spent ^20 of his
O W N money on printing them.
Quite heatedly, he then told us
that it was bad to waste other
people's time and money. We
have done some calculations to
put the whole matter into
perspective. M r Passmore could
have printed 100,000 election
sheets with T H E £500.
Moral of this story . . . . All
animals are equal, but some are
more equal than others — It's
alright for some.
fours faithfully

Dear Editor
From last week's F E L I X it
appears that one M r Steve,
Marshall — the sheriff of the
press, has taken to roaming the
streets of Imperial College with
his gun slung low, beating
unfortunate people like the Gang
of three and 'Denis the menace'
on the draw. However, there are
some big gun slingers around —
the type who leave no man
standing, those who can pump
lead into you so fast even your
ancestors will feel it, so watch out
young Marshall.
Regretfully, we are not in the
USA, where people can be sued
out of existence or else your
lawyers and insurance company
would have a warrant for your
arrest. If you are a man who is
worth anything, defend your
claims that Dare Afolabi, the
President of the Afro-Caribbean
Society, is a compulsive liar,
because we want to know all the
facts. I am delighted that you
realise that W E have the power
to remove you from office,
alternatively, you could resign in
shame. As I've told you there are
some real q u i c k mean gun
slingers a r o u n d — y o u are
warned — Marshall law does not
prevail in IC.
