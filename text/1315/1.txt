Death threats were made to
College security guards by
a group of aggressive young
men, at least one of whom
was carrying a weapon, late
on Monday evening.
Around ten people, many
of whom are thought to be
Imperial College students,
were creating a disturbance
in the entrance to Beit Quad
as they left an event organ-
ised by the Sikh Society. The
security guards attempted to
move them on, but the group
refused and began to shout,
swear and threaten them.
One person was seen car-
rying a weapon, which was
subsequently described as
a “metal bolster” or “large
chisel”.
Four of the group, all young
men, returned 15 minutes
later in an Audi A3, shouting
death threats at the security
guards. Police were called to
the scene and remained at
the Quad entrance overnight
in case the men returned.
The incident casts further
doubt upon the College’s abil-
ity to ensure the safety of
students in the Quad, where
there is normally only one
guard on duty and the secu-
rity lodge is frequently left
unmanned.
Against poverty
Nelson Mandela’s speech in
Trafalgar Square highlighted
the issue of global poverty.
The Make Poverty History
campaign believes that 2005
offers an exceptional opportu-
nity for the UK to take the lead
in turning things around.

Marathon hustings fail to
separate candidates
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Students were given the
opportunity to ask questions
and hear speeches from this
year’s sabbatical election can-
didates at South Kensington,
Silwood Park and Wye earlier
this week. However, despite
the South Kensington hus-
tings lasting four hours, there
was little to separate the can-
didates, and a good propor-
tion of their comments had
already been covered in their
manifestos.
The five students elected
will take on high-level full
time roles within the Union
for the 2005-6 academic year.
The attendance in Da Vinci’s
bar on Monday was, as sever-
al speakers pointed out, dis-
appointingly low. Despite an
advance publicity campaign
centred around former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher,
the vast majority of those
in attendance were either
former sabbaticals or close
friends of the candidates.
The five Presidential can-
didates spent over an hour in
the spotlight at the end of the
evening. James Devine, who
was cheered loudly by his sup-
porters, discussed his pledges
of a smoke-free bar and more
money for clubs and socie-
ties. Sameena Misbahuddin
told the audience that she
had already delivered results
as a Deputy President this
year. Morten Olesen called
the low turnout “a joke” and
said he was standing “to fight
apathy”. Simon Rawson said
he would deliver “good value
catering and other services
in the Union that people
want to use”. Colin Smith
pledged to introduce a ‘one
student, one vote’ method of
governance, saying: “This
should be about politics and
policies, not about CVs”.
Sanjeev Sarda, representing
Re-OpenNominations(RON),
said that a President need-
ed “clarity of vision, strong
morals and great leadership
skills”, and that students
should vote RON for a better
Union.
Mr Devine, Mr Olesen, Mr
Rawson and Mr Smith all
announced that they were
against ‘two-year sabbati-
cals’, claiming that someone
taking a second year would
be less accountable and out
of touch with the students.
Ms Misbahuddin, standing
for a second year in office,
rejected this, arguing that
someone without her experi-
ence would take too long to
learn the role.
The candidates for Felix
Editor were asked what they
would put on the front page
if there was a complete lack
of news in a particular week.
Martin Smith, the current
Broadsheet editor, proposed
an article asking why stu-
dents were not going out and
making the headlines. Darius
Nikbin, this year’s Felix sci-
ence editor, conjured up:
“Felix Editor in binge drink
orgy”. Rupert Neate, who has
very little editorial experi-
ence but has had articles pub-
lished in local newspapers,
suggested a front page story
about the television soap
Neighbours. Simon Clark, the
current Felix nightlife editor,
chose the classic headline:
“Three Creme Eggs for 90p”.
Mr Sarda decided on a com-
pletely blank front page.
