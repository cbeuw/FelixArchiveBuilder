Depressing hustings highlight
Union’s inadequacies
This week’s sabbatical election hus-
tings served as an uncomfortable
reminder of the failings of Imperial
College Union.
The President, Deputy Presidents
and Felix Editor hold some of the
most important roles at this College.
Their positions are the most pow-
erful within the Union, and those
elected have a huge responsibility to
improve and enhance the ‘Imperial
College experience’ for the student
body. Yet, out of over 11,000 students,
less than 100 were present at Da
Vinci’s Bar in South Kensington to
hear what this year’s candidates
had to say.
Should hall rents be based on stu-
dents’ ability to pay? Do you think
that a sabbatical officer serving a
second year would be ‘out of touch’
with the students? Should the Union
campaign to pull British troops out of
Iraq? How can we cut out bureauc-
racy and make clubs and societies
more enjoyable? How important is
‘fun in Felix’ as opposed to a candi-
date’s editorial experience?
I’m sure most of you have a view on
all these issues. It is the sabbaticals
who will make the big decisions and
influence Union and College policy,
but, for whatever reason, nine out
of ten students won’t bother to vote
between tomorrow and Tuesday.
How can the Union call itself a
truly ‘representative’ organisation
when only 10% of students will vote
in its biggest elections and only 5%
took part in its strategic review?
I won’t labour this point any fur-
ther, as there are still other mat-
ters to discuss – the poor turnout
was just one of many things that
disappointed me as I sat through
four miserable hours of hustings on
Monday night.
The vast majority of people in
attendance were either candidates
or their friends, and it was sickening
to see them take little or no inter-
est in proceedings when other peo-
ple were under the spotlight. Some
candidates were heckled – loudly,
rudely and without any good reason.
People asked ridiculous questions
about fruit, animals, sex toys and
impersonating motor vehicles. What
was the point? How was that going
to improve our students’ union?
One member of the audience, who
pointed to the low turnout and asked
candidates whether the elections
were really relevant, was jeered and
heckled. Any candidate with a real-
istic, serious message was derided
as “boring” and shouted down in
favour of catchy slogans, empty
promises and pledges about ‘fun’.
That is not the way to a better Union
or a better student experience here
at Imperial College.
Some candidates were victimised,
as people ‘bent the rules’ by asking
questions that may have seemed
‘addressed to all’ on the surface but
were clearly aimed at certain indi-
viduals in particular.
I haven’t decided who to vote for
yet. But, regardless of the failings of
our students’ union, I will certainly
be voting tomorrow, and you should
too. It will take you 15 minutes,
at most, to read the candidates’
manifestos and interviews [see
pages 13-18 of this newspaper] and
vote online at www.union.ic.ac.uk/
elections. As improbable as it may
sound, the people you elect can
change your life for the better.
So if a candidate stands for some-
thing you feel strongly about, make
your voice heard and hopefully
they’ll be able to address that issue
in a positive way next year. But
don’t just look at their promises –
what evidence is there that they can
deliver? What have they done in the
past that will make them capable or
incapable of doing the job? Who has
the most relevant experience? Who
has the best ideas? Who is in touch
with what the students really want?
Who sets realistic, achievable, sen-
sible goals? On the other hand, who
doesn’t quite know what they’re
talking about? And who is just doing
it for CV points? It’s important that
you vote. It’s equally important that
you vote for the people who can real-
ly improve your Union, your College
and your life.
The final indignity of Monday night
came when the hustings drew to a
close and the Presidential candi-
dates were ‘asked’ to down a pint of
their choice. Call it fun, call it tradi-
tion, call it what you like, but if you’d
rather watch six people drink a pint
than find out about how they can
improve your life at Imperial, then
perhaps you don’t deserve a good
students’ union after all.

FURIOUS GEORGE
The joy of... elections
Sabbatical elections
Unless you are walking around with
your eyes closed, you will have heard
about the sabbatical elections. We
have 16 candidates standing this
year for the five sabbatical posts,
so it promises to be the most hotly
contested and exciting set of elec-
tions in recent memory. For more
information, turn to pages 13-18 of
this newspaper or check out www.
union.ic.ac.uk/elections.
The Union is the recognised voice
of Imperial College students, and
constantly strives to improve their
lives and look after their education-
al, social and welfare needs. The
people you elect will lead the Union
next year, so make sure you vote!
QAA student written
submission
I have informed you of the role of
the Quality Assurance Agency in
monitoring higher education, and
the College’s impending institu-
tional audit, in previous issues, so
I shall not bore you again here. The
Student Written Statement, which
I produced on your behalf, was
approved by the Union’s governing
body (Council), and has now been
sent off to the agency. It can be read
at www.union.ic.ac.uk/qaa. It has
raised a few issues that the Union
will be looking to resolve through
dialogue with the College.
Get on your bike!
Last Friday’s bike auction was
a great success, with around 50
people braving the January drizzle,
taking about 35 bikes off our hands
and raising over £1000. The money
will be used for the benefit of cyclists
on campus in the future. If anyone is
interested in setting up a co-opera-
tive to help cyclists maintain their
bikes, and represent cycling issues
to College, please contact benjamin.

disaster.
Tickets are available from Union
Reception and the Reynolds Bar.

Day of disobedience
15 February 2005. That is the date
to keep in your head if you oppose
the ongoing war and occupation in
Iraq.
There are many reasons to oppose
the occupation. They include the fact
that over 100,000 Iraqis have been
killed so far, mostly in air strikes.
They also include the increasing
number of casualties and fatali-
ties amongst British and American
troops, a large number of whom
are economic conscripts – soldiers
who joined for financial reasons,
and not explicitly to be sent to kill
and destroy in an illegal war. Then
there is the increasingly widespread
use of torture used by British and
American forces on Iraqi prisoners
– torture that seems to be part of
the very way these armies are work-
ing in occupied Iraq.
Another reason is the fact that
there simply can be no democracy
under occupation. The recent ‘elec-
tions’ in Iraq have been spun as the
birth of democracy, and indeed it
was extremely uplifting to see the
emotion on the faces of Shias vot-
ing in what they believed to be free
elections. But it looks increasingly
as if all those Shias who voted did
so to try to end the occupation. And
what about the Sunnis, who boy-
cotted to try to end the occupation?
Or the fact that the elections were
held under a state of emergency,
some parts of Iraq did not even have
polling stations, many of the candi-
dates’ identities were kept secret,
a US-controlled body had ultimate
control over who did and did not
stand... the list goes on.
Given that the ‘coalition of the
willing’ never, even in their words,
went to Iraq explicitly to bring
democracy, it is unlikely that they
will listen to the wishes of the Iraqis
and get out. And so, with the 16
permanent bases they are building,
with large parts of the economy pri-
vatised with all profits going to US
companies, and with still very little
provision of water, electricity and
fuel, resistance to the occupation
will continue. This is a resistance
whose active members number
over 200,000 according to the CIA,
well above the number of British
and American troops there. Clearly,
those who have passive support for
the resistance much higher.
But the reason I ask everyone
to oppose the occupation is for the
sake of Babar Ahmad, as this is an
issue that our own students’ union
has passed policy on. As long as
the ‘war on terror’ continues, the
victimisation of minority groups at
home, and Muslims in particular,
is going to continue. To support
Babar’s case is also to oppose the
brutality of what is taking place in
Iraq.
So, I’m asking everyone to
take part in the national ‘Day of
Disobedience’ against the occupa-
tion on 15 February. It will start at
9am with a three minute silence in
remembrance of all those killed in
the war and occupation. At 12.30pm,
people are meeting on the Queen’s
Lawn for on-campus protest and
demonstration. And then at 3pm, we
are meeting in Beit Quad to march
down to Parliament Square and join
students from across London in a
‘die-in’. These events have all been
organised in the run up to the major
national anti-war demonstration on
19 March.
Finally, the next stage of Babar
Ahmad’s extradition hearing goes
to court on 2 March, and his fam-
ily and supporters will gather out-
side the court in London in protest.
We hope to send a large delegation
from Imperial. Anyone interested
in any of these issues should email
me at cs602@ic.ac.uk, or look out
for posters that will be appearing
around the College soon.
