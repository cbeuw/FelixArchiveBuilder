Last week, nineties rock heroes
Green Day showed the Brixton
Academy crowd why punk can still
be king in an age of paranoid con-
servative politics.
For the world tour of their new
album, Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike
Dirnt and Tre Cool have drawn on
all their years of pop-punk experi-
ence to produce a show capable of
matching American Idiot in power,
passion and imagination.
The band exploded onto the stage
with the album’s lead single and
title track, before ordering, “Sing
it so those rednecks can hear us!”
The politics of the grown-up Green
Day material may be controversial
amongst some fans, but the 5000
here in attendance seemed in fine
voice for joining in: “Don’t wanna
be an American idiot... One nation
controlled by the media”.
The crowd seems just as excited
by the following Jesus Of Suburbia,
a nine minute epic, and one of the
two pieces of cross-track storytell-
ing which have left traditional three-
minute punks suspicious of the new
album. When the classic material
started flowing (Longview, Basket
Case, Brain Stew, Hitchin’ A Ride,
even 2000 Lightyears Away) it was
heart-warming to hear that most
of the evenly mixed 14 to 40 crowd
knew all the words to both the old
and new songs.
What raises a Green Day con-
cert above the pop-punk competi-
tion is the band’s tireless commit-
ment to entertaining their audience.
The band never let the pace drop,
with water pistols, pyrotechnics,
sing-alongs and even getting the
audience up on stage to play. For
one and a half hours, Billie Joe
climbed speaker stacks and charged
the length of the stage, seemingly
trying to engage every one of the
capacity crowd with his trademark
crazy-eyed stare.
Presumably as a treat for us Brits,
King For A Day was merged seam-
lessly into Lulu’s Shout and the show
was finished with a brilliant cover of
Queen’s We Are The Champions.
As the words “We’ll keep on fight-
ing till the end” flashed up on their
massive dot-matrix backdrop, this
song seemed a perfectly appropri-
ate choice. To Green Day, punk isn’t
just a phase you go through as a
teenager, but a philosophy for life.
And the way Billie Joe tells it, his
fight now is against America’s neo-
conservatives for our freeedom as
individuals. His take-home mes-
sage: “Don’t let the powers that be
tell you how to live your life... Listen
to your heart and to your mind!”
Good advice indeed.
Finally we were left with Mr
Armstrong alone on the stage, play-
ing a stirring solo electric version of
the truly anthemic Good Riddence
and sharing the wish: “I hope you
had the time of your life.” After a
show like that, who wouldn’t have?

American idiots? Apparently not
Green Day have been playing their brand of melodic pop-punk for what seems like forever.
Now they’ve caught a dose of politics, bringing their new material to the UK for the first time

Norman Cook and Bootsy Collins
have reunited for this ambitious
remake of the Steve Miller Band
classic The Joker.
Fatboy enlisted Bootsy’s magic on
the inspired Weapon Of Choice on
his last album in 2001, and The Joker
is the lead single from his latest
offering Palookaville. This is defi-
nitely a controversial track – Steve
Miller fans will likely loathe it, or at
least loathe to like it, while Bootsy
fans will gush about his masterful
vocals and witty improvs. Love it or
hate it, this song will get your foot
tapping with its catchy riffs, reg-
gae overtone and infectious sense
of fun.
I rather like this song – it is quite
simply as silly and absurd as Bootsy
himself. He drenches it with his con-
tagious outrageousness that cannot
fail to make you smile. The Joker is
released on 28th February. Fo shiz-
zle ma nizzle. Ben Ramadan
Question: what do you get if you mix
folk music with some hip hop beats
and a sprinkling of a kids’ chorus?
Answer: the debut single from one
of the most hotly tipped artists of the
year, Jem Griffiths.
If you haven’t heard of this 29-
year-old Welsh singer songwriter,
don’t worry, you definitely will soon.
She has already managed to cap-
tivate American listeners with her
considerable talents – her music
has been used on US series Six Feet
Under and she made a special guest
appearance in the season finale of
hit US teen drama The OC.
So, does she have the songs to live
up to the acclaim? On this evidence
she certainly does. Kicking in with a
strong hip hop beat and incorporat-
ing elements of Prelude In F Minor,
by a certain Mr JS Bach, Jem cer-
tainly shows no fear in mixing styles
to define a sound which is so infec-
tious it will no doubt burrow its way
into your head within minutes of
your first listen. Say hello to 2005’s
next big thing. Dom Wong
The Game, aka Jayceon Taylor, has
induced a lot of excitement in hiphop
circles.
Described as “the new future of
hip-hop”, he turned to rapping after
waking from a coma and shedding a
shady past of dealing and robbery to
try his luck in a world where bullet
wounds get you noticed.
How We Do is the first single from
his debut album The Documentary,
which has had nods of approval
from Kayne West, Timbaland, Mary
J Blige and Eminem. It’s a top notch
Dre tune, featuring vocal subsidies
from 50 Cent – you get the impres-
sion Game is being led by the both
hands into the hip-hop world.
It works. The tune is both simple
and catchy, and while Game’s lyrics
could be more original, he lives up to
Dre’s quality production. The spare
808 beat and fifties influence are sure
to make this a dancefloor favourite.
Listen out for this tune after the sin-
gle’s Valentine’s Day release, and be
prepared to hear a lot more from G
Unit’s latest prodigy.

iTunes is selling half a billion songs a
year; it is an all powerful marketing
machine which iPod users (about
the whole world) are all too familiar
with. Notably, it has an uncanny abil-
ity to classify almost any song, and
when its pushed to the limits (such
as Kid Symphony) it just shoves
it in the ‘Unclassifiable’ genre. So
after reading an interview with
(ex-At The Drive In, and now) The
Mars Volta vocalist, Cedric Bixler
Zavala, describing how the Volta try
to break down labeling of genres, I
was surprised that their new single
The Widow was popped into the
‘Alternative’ tab – I am sure he’s not
pleased.
As the first single from their
new album Francis The Mute, The
Widow is another trip down wierdo-
prog lane. Once more, strange lyrics
flow out of the sharp-tongued mouth
of Cedric throughout the operat-
ic track, which opens with unfor-
gettable wailing vocals before the
start of the trademark eerie guitar
used extensively on their debut LP
.
Listening to the single, I couldn’t
help feeling a Muse influence, the
vocal and instrumental tracks swell
and die out to a slow beat, with epic
intensity, shredding and horns.
The lyrics on their debut album
(De-Loused In The Comatorium)
described the world dreamt up by a
coma victim but take a different turn
on Frances The Mute, animating the
journals of Volta’s lost friend Jeremy
(Ward, died of a heroin overdose –
Ed). Whilst the video depicts a death
dealer trawling the streets of a wast-
ed city, the anger and stress within
the song is notable, with imagery of
broken men and rampant fear – a
slow ballad, Mars Volta style.
Strangely, the song seems overly
familiar (and immediately identifi-
able as the Volta’s). Whether it’s
because of their desire to cast off
any label, or the epic concept album
feel their songs have, the new,
refined Mars Volta sounds like a
second take of their first attempt
and not the innovative, progressive
band they claim to be.
