Beagle 2 report
When Charles Darwin set off
on his trip to the Gapalapagos
islands, he must have made
had enough provisions on
board his good ship, The
Beagle.
But when Colin Pill-ock-inger
decided to send a bacofoil
probe to Mars, he must have
had his sideburns in a twist.
A new report published by
the European Space Agency
(ESA) this week has officially
said...
Beagle 2 would have had a
better chance of success if it
was entered in Robot Wars.
Chance
But it’s all very well to be
cynical when all is done and
‘moon-dusted’.
Surely if would have made
more sense if they had pub-
lished the report before the
mission took-off.
Then we could have spent
the money on the NHS or
deporting bogus asylum seek-
ers.
Tsunami stop!
Important new research at the
Portsmouth Polytechnic has
shown that the tsunami that
devastated vast regions of
South-East Asia, could have
been prevented.
Wall
Engineers have calculated
that a 10 metre thick, 100 me-
tre high solid metal ‘sea wall’
defending coastlines in the
area may have harmlessly
deflected the wave onto Aus-
tralia.
Le Pundit says: build the
metal sea-wall now and save
lives tomorrow.
Einstein Schmeinstein
Not a lot of people know this,
but I once met Einstein in
the 1950s in a swanky bar
called Los Mosquitos in
Northampton.
Most people who met
Einstein were often said to be
overawed by the great man’s
massive intelligence.
But it turned out to be vice-
versa when we met...
As a test, I asked him this
simple question:
“If God doesn’t play dice
then who does?”
Suffice to say he was
stumped for an answer.
I had turned the tables in this
landmark battle of wits.
The correct answer (which
eluded Einstein) is of course:
‘gamblers’.
Forget Einstein Year, this is
Pundit Year!

The evolutionary biology of nipples
Obscene molecules: no. 314
This week we look at a molecule who is isn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the box. Moronic acid to
be precise. Apparently this is a triterpenoid organic acid that is found in Pistacia resin. No-one
know why it is called Moronic acid – its chemical properties share little in common with other
morons such as Pop Idol’s Simon Cowell and crap Superman impersonator Alvin Joel.

There has been a lot of debate
in science as to whether
human anatomical features
such as tonsils and appen-
dices are indeed superflu-
ous and simply not required
for survival. Wisdom teeth
and the male foreskin are
also, arguably, unnecessary,
redundant, and for many just
a cumbersome bother that
has to be removed.
What about nipples? Both
men and women share these
comic looking appendages,
yet what functions do they
actually carry out in the male
of the species?
Unlike appendices, tonsils,
and so on, nipples seem to be
redundant only in males and
are truly required, in terms of
reproductive success, only in
females. Yet all men proudly
and pointlessly own a pair.
Male nipples are far small-
er than their female counter-
parts and are obviously not
used for lactation (nor is there
any evidence to suggest they
have been used for lactation
in the prehistoric male). Yet
the temptation of classifying
them as simple protrusions
would not do them justice.
The male nipple is in fact
a fully equipped organ pos-
sessing all the usual appara-
tus of blood vessel, muscles,
nerves and even oil glands.
A thin muscle present under
the female nipple which upon
stimulation projects the nip-
ple for the baby results, in
males, in the flattening of
the puffed male nipple areola
(the coloured ring around the
human nipple). Furthermore,
both men and women can
experience pleasure thanks
to the nerves that innervate
the areola.
The male nipple is not
therefore totally useless, yet
moderate tactile pleasure
hardly justifies its presence.
Humans are mammals
(from the Latin mamma that
means breast), hence, by defi-
nition, we suckle our young.
But men do not suckle.
Human nipples appear in
the third or fourth week of
embryionic development and
both female and male babies
are born with nipples and
their ducts intact. This is
made clear as during embry-
onic development differentia-
tion towards a foetus which
will give rise to a girl or a
boy takes place at around six
to eight weeks after fertilisa-
tion (well after the appear-
ance of nipples), when the
male and female hormones
are activated. Dr Sherfey
writes in a paper published in
the Journal of Sexual Marital
Theory that at this stage,
in foetuses which will give
rise to a boy, enough male
androgens (the male sex hor-
mones) are produced to offset
the maternal estrogens (the
female sex hormones) and
maleness develops.
In other words the hormone
testosterone is activated on
the Y chromosome that mas-
culinises the embryo. This
alters its physical develop-
ment towards generating
male features and leading
to the development of male
genitalia; it is however unable
to reverse the nipple forma-
tion process that has already
taken place.
The human embryonic
pathway thus involves the
early presence of ‘precursor
nipples’ (which appear before
the start of sexual differen-
tiation) which may or may
not develop into future func-
tional breasts; in essence,
males have rudimentary nip-
ples because both sexes are
variations of a basic ‘nipple-
equipped’ design.
Many take this as evidence
of the fact that the natural
form of all species is, physi-
ologically speaking, female
and those keen on drama-
tizing add (to the displeas-
ure of all male chauvinists)
that males are thus merely
‘mutant’ females.
Steven Jay Gould, in his
book Bully For Brontosaurus
– Reflections In Natural
History, explains why evo-
lution has not changed this
specific male anatomical nip-
ple feature. Gould argues that
nature takes the path of least
resistance so that anatomical
features are selected against
only if they are sufficiently
disadvantageous.
As Andrew Simons, jour-
nalist for the Scientific
American, aptly makes clear
in his article on Why Men
have Nipples? the genet-
ic ‘default’ is for men and
women to share characters.
Nipples are consequently just
accidental leftovers of our
evolutionary past that persist
simply because of a lack of
selection against them rather
than selection for them.
Besides, men would look
odd without them.
Janet Jackson’s famous nipple exhibition of 2004 will be on
view at the Science Museum from June
It is obvious why women have them, but why do men have nipples? Giovanna Larice
explores the biology of nipples, looking at their place in evolution and foetal development
