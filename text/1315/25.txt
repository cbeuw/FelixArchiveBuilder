LIVE REVIEWS
Generally speaking, Brixton isn’t the
place you want to be whilst wearing
a long black coat and heavy eye-
liner, or other paraphernalia of the
metal-loving community. However,
there’s safety in numbers, and the
black-clad hordes descending on the
Academy up to three hours before
doors remained more or less unmo-
lested. Some had come from as far
away as Norway, so they had a right
to expect a damn good time. They
were not disappointed.
Openers Apocalyptica were a rev-
elation. Seated on angular metal
thrones against a stark background,
they played the heaviest of heavy
metal on cellos from hell. Yes, that’s
right – cellos. Classically trained
to a man, these Finnish maniacs
offer a novel take on the arche-
typal hard-rocking metal usually
purveyed by the likes of Pantera
and Slayer, and it works surprisingly
well. Live, their purely instrumental
renditions of everything from the
Metallica covers of their early days
to self-penned anthems from their
newly released album, the self-titled
Apocalyptica, are like a window into
another world.
The rich, soulful tones of the cel-
los cut smoothly through your brain
to clutch at your heart, contrast-
ing beautifully and magnificently
with the jagged melodies coaxed
from them. Combined with manic
head-banging that shouldn’t be pos-
sible while sitting down and the kind
of playing-from-all-angles antics
that wouldn’t have disgraced Jimi
Hendrix, theirs was a set to remem-
ber and cherish. The audience
lapped it up, going from what-the-
hell-is-this bewilderment to jump-
ing-up-and-down enthusiasm in
seconds. They sang along to Enter
Sandman and roared their appre-
ciation at every pause: a stunning
response to a band that have noth-
ing like the recognition they deserve
in this country. The crowd even
cheered and threw the horns for the
triumphant closer, Edvard Grieg’s
classical masterpiece In The Hall
Of The Mountain King; now that’s
what I call a crossover success.
No one knows how to put on a
show like Rammstein. Opener Reise
Reise began with clearing smoke
revealing the band posed on a giant
two-tier stage of industrial-looking
platforms. The first deep, guttur-
al notes of overpowering German
vocals set the tone for what was to
come: an hour and fifty minutes of
complete mayhem. The show really
kicked off with third song Feuer
Frei, when singer Till and guitarists
Richard and Paul donned masks to
breath twelve-foot flames over the
audience; the heat could be felt at
the very back of the venue. After this,
nothing could be the same. Whether
it be covering the crowd in red,
white and blue confetti in Amerika,
Till boiling keyboardist Flake in a
giant pot (heated, naturally, with a
flamethrower) during recent single
Mein Teil, or Paul crowd-surfing
around the auditorium in a dinghy
for final song Stripped, the Teutonic
nutcases just kept on upping the
ante.
The crowd went wild when Till
shot fireworks at them from a giant
crossbow and immense gouts of
flame lit up the stage during Du
Hast; they laughed like mani-
acs when Flake rode around the
stage on a Segway whilst playing
Amerika; they whooped when vari-
ous members ran around in suits
covered in fireworks. Let’s face it,
who wouldn’t?
The driving percussion, throb-
bing guitars and visceral vocals that
have hypnotised many a metal-club
dance floor were all present in a
set that covered most of the new
album and all the old classics, from
Rammstein to Sonne and much in
between, meaning that no one could
leave dissatisfied. Their industrial-
metal stylings have entranced mil-
lions across the world for years on
record, but truly nothing can com-
pare with them live. When your lead
singer had to become a qualified
pyrotechnician so that you could
perform, that pretty much goes
without saying.
Rammstein: if anyone knows a
better way to have fun with six oiled
Germans in leather lederhosen, I’d
like to know about it.

“I collect badgers!” beams front-
man Dave Allen in the band’s hotel
bar – only he’s pointing at circu-
lar logo-bearing pins on his bag so
we figure he’s said ‘badges’ and
quickly replace bewildered expres-
sions with ones of glee and mutual
badge-appreciation. Amidst the con-
fusion that follows, we accidentally
convince Dave that his band has
been likened to Elton John in the
music press, subsequently throwing
in a ‘gayness test’, then suggesting
that he’d like to interact with his
own mother. All in all, a sober outing
for Felix.
We’re back in Hal’s hotel awaiting
the young Irish four-piece’s arrival.
Dave’s the first to stroll into the bar
fresh from their soundcheck at the
Camden Barfly. He’s alone, expres-
sionless and heading straight for
the gents. A minute later his three
bandmates emerge, relaxed and
cheerful. Dave’s younger brother
Paul, also the band’s bass player,
seems pleased to have spotted us.
He’s gripping the note we left them
at reception and tells us that the
soundcheck went well. “Why don’t
you interview him in the toilets?!”
suggests a short-haired guy in thick-
framed spectacles. It turns out this
character is Steve Hogan, Hal’s
funny-man drummer, all but invis-
ible in band photographs. When it
comes down to it, they all seem
more than happy to let Dave speak
for the band.
With Hal’s virtual plot of cyber-
space, Halmusic.com, promising a
wealth of intriguing band news and
links, only to deliver more ‘com-
ing soon’ messages than a Friday
night visit to your local Odeon, we
decided to play an interactive game
of ‘human website’ with Dave to
fill in the gaps and find out exactly
what’s going on in the Hal camp.
First up, we clicked on NEWS. Dave
happily obliges by informing us that
his day has been mostly comprised
of badge-shopping in Camden. In
the joy that ensues, the one of us
dressed in lady’s clothing subjects
Dave to an in-depth showcase of the
twenty badges on her skirt. Dave
takes to the game of ‘pick your
favourite badge’ without even being
asked. He likes the spotty one with
a dog on it, and then returns the
favour with a guided tour of his very
own badge collection. Highlights
include his ‘Art Brut’ badge, one of
a dog in American Indian headgear,
and a lonesome ‘Bloc’ badge longing
for a ‘Party’ counterpart. Having
purchased the badge at a Bloc Party
gig in Sweden, he’s eagerly awaiting
receipt of the ‘Party’ pin bought by
a friend at a Dublin Bloc Party gig.
Dave’s a big Bloc Party fan. Now
that’s news to us.
Next up, SIGHT & SOUND. With
Hal’s debut single entitled Worry
About The Wind, we hilariously find
out that Dave did in fact worry about
the wind once upon a time, and
that his favourite hurricane (but
not the band’s namesake) would
be Hurricane Hal. The band are,
in reality, named after Hal Blaine,
Dave’s favourite drummer of all
time who played in every band in
the early 60s as far as we could
tell, including the Ronnettes as well
as on the Beach Boys’ Petsounds,
Hal’s mutual favourite record and
undoubtedly their biggest influ-
ence.
Then t’was time to navigate
our virtual cursor to the ‘HAL
’S
FAVOURITE THINGS’ link. Already
fully aware of the badge obsession,
we were keen to find out what other
unspeakable things Dave was into. “I
like little funny things” we’re told. “I
change my answer message on my
phone once a month. I put myself in
a different imaginary scenario each
month and that’s the reason I can’t
get to the phone”. Intrigued, we ask
what surreal experience we’d be
exposed to if we rang him right this
minute. “I hate those McCafes, so
I speeded up my voice on a dicta-
phone so I sound like a chipmunk on
drugs, and I am apparently sitting
shooting the breeze in a McCafe
somewhere in Dublin, thinking
about life, and someone rang me
up two weeks ago and said change
your answer message, it’s gay!” At
this point we clumsily throw in a
‘sexuality test’ based on the length
of Dave’s index finger versus that
of his ring finger, only to find that
“No, no, I’m definitely not that way
orientated at all... so I’m going to
change my message on the first of
the month to something less gay,
maybe slow it down to sound like
Johnny Cash!” We feel enlightened
and privileged but he still doesn’t
give us his number.
When we try to inform Dave that
it’s been suggested elsewhere in the
music press that Elton John would
probably love Hal, he misconstrues
what we’re saying as, “you guys
sound like Elton John!”. We haven’t
the heart to correct him and instead
listen to Dave sigh in shock and
needlessly defend his band’s integ-
rity by listing such great influences
as Neil Young, his favourite track
being Don’t Let It Bring You Down.
Eventually, both Felix and Dave
feel so at ease with one another that
we ditch the ‘clicking on links’ meta-
phor and ask him what it was like
touring with label-mates Delays.
We discover that Delays’ Gilbert
brothers were just like nurturing
big brothers to Hal’s Allen brothers.
Sweet.
Onstage it’s a ten-track set, effec-
tively a taster of Hal’s forthcoming
self-titled album, though current
single and album-opener What A
Lovely Dance, described by Dave
as “a magical experience of fall-
ing in love… and then out of love”,
is saved for the all-important third
song slot. Mid-set we’re presented
with a beautiful number, Keep Love
As Your Golden Rule, a song sound-
ing not too dissimilar to the Beach
Boys’ God Only Knows. Debut sin-
gle, Worry About The Wind is saved
for the end of the set and with it’s
gorgeous harmonica-laden endtro,
is well worth the wait. Falsetto-deliv-
ered soaring melodies have been
done before – Geneva failed due to
lead singer Andrew Montgomery’s
hideously grimacing face in per-
formance. Dave Allen, on the other
hand, appears onstage dressed all
in white with the breathtaking voice
of an angel, ensuring that Hal’s sun-
kissed Beach Boys-esque tunes will
be favourably received.
Catch them on their ‘back by popu-
lar demand’ extra date at Rendition
in London. To listen to the interview
