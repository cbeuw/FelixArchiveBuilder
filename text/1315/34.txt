Sussex Women’s 1st 8
Imperial Women’s 1st 0
It was a cold Wednesday
morning when we all met
apprehensively at London
Bridge. Unfortunately, ‘all’
consisted of seven players
and no goalie! Quel domage!
But to Sussex we went, not
thinking of the storm ahead.
We were offered 35 minutes
each way by the ref due to our
lack of players, but the oppo-
sition refused! Kick-off was
given to Sussex, but it soon
appeared that they weren’t
all that! We were only seven
and substantially more petite,
but we definitely had pres-
ence on the pitch. It took them
25 minutes to score with our
defence (all the team) hold-
ing them up-field with amaz-
ing offside traps (at least 20
free-kicks given to us in the
first half!). We kept posses-
sion well although when we
lost it, they stretched us far
and wide. This was handled
beautifully by the stunningly
fit (in more ways than one)
and agile IC ladies.
Libby, the brave Brummie
in goal for the first time,
showed us her hidden talents
by making some spectacular
saves from fast, unpredict-
able shots. Kathy (who can do
amazing things with her legs)
defended brilliantly down
the right and smelt very nice
whilst doing it: strawberries.
Guiles, our centre defender,
kept us in line and made some
amazing sprints and tackles,
which kept Sussex’s strikers
at bay.
Our team captain, Poppy,
picked up on a free-kick and
sprinted fast for something so
small in the distance: Sussex’s
goal. After dribbling past their
defence, Poppy executed a
shot that just nudged their
keeper. They had learned to
fear us! And so they should
as Chloé, our left winger, did
not allow anyone down her
line. When she had the ball
(Zidane-like, French genes at
work) she always managed
to find Poppy or Joe and tri-
angulate their way forward.
The right side was held by
Joe, who, during one of her
many forays back to defend
the goal, pulled off such a
perfect tackle that she got
congratulated by the girl she
took down. Courageous Alex
(the birthday girl) ran left and
right with amazing defending
tactics and skills and, along
with Guiles and Kathy, held
the line tight. She was chal-
lenged by a girl three times
her size in the second half
and still managed to save the
goal.
The whistle blew for full
time and the game ended at
8-0, but the IC ladies can hold
their heads high because we
played fantastically with only
seven players and each player
gave a great performance!
The score wasn’t that impor-
tant in the end because so
much fun was had by all. And
not just on the pitch but by
celebrating with some burg-
ers and chips in Brighton! IC
ladies... shaking that ass!

Imperial Men’s 1st 3
UCL Men’s 1st 2
(after extra time)
By Oliver Wright
Imperial’s flagship football
team returned to Shenley to
avengethesemi-finaldefeatof
two years ago. Admittedly, we
were playing UCL Seconds,
and a win should have been a
formality for such a talented
bunch of individuals, but as
we all know, anything can
happen in the cup!
The game kicked off, and
with Imperial sleeping, UCL
wasquicktocapitalise. Firstly,
a blistering strike from a UCL
midfielder seemed to be fir-
ing into the top corner until a
flying Peruvian by the name
of Carlos Alberto Vasquez
diverted the danger. What a
goalie!
The pressure persisted,
however, and after a neat
build up, their striker (who
was smelly) fired past the
on-rushing keeper. One-nil.
Uberbeef! The troops ral-
lied and, following a Chris
Woodcock free-kick, T found
Pat Farr free in the box to
equalise. One-one. Back of
the net!
The goal seemed to inspire
theteamtoproducesomesex-
ual football. One such piece of
erotic play saw Timur com-
bine brilliantly with Javier to
slot calmly past the ‘keeper.
Eat my goal! Imperial began
to dominate, with a thunder-
ous effort from Berksy arrow-
ing just over, but the third
goal remained elusive.
The second half started
much the same as the first,
with sloppy Imperial defend-
ing and gifting their smelly
striker a second goal.
Again Imperial responded
in the best possible way, cre-
ating numerous chances, but
our luck wasn’t in. Javier was
pulling the strings in the mid-
dle, and a couple of his efforts
narrowly missed the target.
As full time approached,
JR, T and Mathan all had
chances to win it, but last
ditch defending saved UCL.
Full time, two-two!
A rousing team talk by the
hamstrung badger breathed
lifeintoachinglimbs.Imperial
again looked the most likely
to win the game, but they
had to rely on the agility of
their South American stop-
per to keep them in it. In the
final moments of the game,
Woodcock whipped in a dan-
gerous corner, and Pat Farr,
who’d been a rock in defence
all game, rose to power in the
winner. GET IN! His second
of the game brought ecstatic
celebrations and a huge sigh
of relief.
Special mentions must go
to Carlos and Berksy who
covered every blade of grass,
and man of the match Pat
Farr. A tough tie against LSE
Firsts now beckons in the
quarters, as Imperial hunt for
the ULU Cup.

(dD) attempt to dominate the
sports pages, another match
report is brought to you for
your perusal, even if it only
gets read by those of you at
home sat on the bog!
Last week dD took a timely
trip to Falmer (Brighton) to
take on two teams in a match-
day hosted by University
of Sussex’s own team,
Mohawks.
First a bit of background
work: In the run-up to the
regional play-offs in six weeks
time it had been taken upon
the South East teams to go
head-to-head against as many
teams in as many matches as
possible in order to feasibly
seed 30+ teams that would
be competing for a place in
the nationals. Does that make
sense? Basically, this means
that various teams would play
each other to see where they
ranked (roughly) in the region
to ensure that they got a fair
fight at the actual regional
tournament. And so the “lad-
der system” was born. This
means that teams gained
points (and thus rank) not
only by playing matches, but
also for going against better
teams on their home ground
even if they lost! Genius.
Another reason is to increase
the profile of student ultimate
(as it’s called by those play-
ing Ultimate Frisbee) in the
SE region, which lacks good
student teams despite hav-
ing the best open Mens team
nationally. Proudly, dD’s own
star mid-receiver, Kris Wong,
played a vital role in devising
the ladder system.
Enough of that technical
babble. dD showed up with
seven players and three
rolling subs in Brighton
suited and booted who were:
Emmanuel “I can’t catch, but
I’m still President!” Bennett,
Neville “Captain Canadian”
Dubash, Chris “Those big red
balls cost £120!” Rowlands,
Ian “Munky” Ballantyne, Jee
“smallbutcool”Kwan,George
“Gordan” Brownbridge,
Laurie “I always get the
girl” Fischer, Stas “CTAC”
Parpantel, Nathan “I’m the
best” Muir and yours truly.
Although this wasn’t the
entire first team, as sched-
uled dD were ready to take on
the regions best and worst. In
total six teams showed up to
play two matches each and
pick up some well-earned
rank points: Under Cover
Lovers (UCL), Mohawks
(SussexUni),Brunel(that’sit;
that’s their name), Holloway
Hammers, Surrey Scorpions
and dD. Our first match was
against Brunel:
Disc Doctors 1
Brunel 11
Having convinced us of their
ability at indoor regionals last
term, both teams wanted to
prove their outdoor worth for
the first time on the field.
With their full 1st team,
Brunel lined up ready to take
on dD and, unperturbed, we
threw a zone play (imagine
a wall of three players mark-
ing the player with posses-
sion of the disc) as a defen-
sive tactic for the first point.
As it turned out, their main
receiver and “hucker” was
able to break this with huge
throws up either side of the
pitch to a skilful, high-jump-
ing receiver and managed to
beat any of our deep defend-
ers. Quite annoying really.
Then, to make matters worse,
they threw their own defen-
sive play that comprised of
one player trying to cut out
any open-side passes (a.k.a
a “poach”) merely by guard-
ing close open space usually
left clear for cutters. Brunel
continued to dominate the
match with precision and skill
despite Manny’s committed
lay-out (equivalent to a diving
header with your hands to
catch the disc) to deny Brunel,
one of the points. Just when
we had got used to break-
ing their defence with some
great passes and expert flow
to allow Stas to score, Brunel
took the match comfortably. I
guess we didn’t “suck it up”
enough, dammit!
Disc Doctors 11
Under Cover Lovers 2
Down, but not out were
Neville’s (ye old Club Captain)
words of wisdom that ensured
lessons were learnt. The next
game was to be a whole differ-
ent story. Unfortunately, UCL
could only field six players
(short by one) and so were
outnumbered for the duration
of the match. But that didn’t
stop them from scoring on us.
With myself and Chris lead-
ing from the back with some
good flow and up-field passes
to the mid player receivers
(Manny and Munky), dD took
quick charge of the game.
Due to being outnumbered
UCL could only try clever for-
mations, sacrificing players
into a zone-type play. But dD
had practiced against much
of this in the preceding weeks
and easily broke UCL
’s strat-
egy with impressive points
from Manny, Stas and George.
Despite long-field hucks and
end-zone hammers by “Easy”
(UCL), dD proved their merit
by taking the game well within
the 40 minute time limit.
I hope most of that made
sense folks, and if it didn’t,
why not come along to a prac-
tice sometime? Practices are
nearby in Hyde Park next to
the tennis courts. Just look
out for the flying discs! All
levels of ability are welcome,
and no previous experience
is necessary. You could make
the first team in less than a
year!
Keep it real y’all. Track dD’s
route to regionals here in the
coming six weeks.
