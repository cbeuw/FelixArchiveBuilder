Yorkshire New Year
Trip 2005
By Harry Wood
We decided that a repeat
of the previous New Year’s
antics was definitely in order,
but from the start it was
clear that this trip would be
a complicated one. Everyone
wanted to show up for some
paddling on different dates,
and drive to Yorkshire from
different Christmas holiday
locations. Chaos
To make matters worse,
those club members who nor-
mally take up the organisa-
tional challenge decided they
were fed up of it and went on
strike, leading to a bizarre
situation in which Harry was
labelled ‘the most organised’.
Harry responded by throwing
technology at the problem.
Ludicrously complex spread-
sheets and wiki websites
were put in place, and eventu-
ally we all came together...
Theo, Nick and Jeurgen
were the only ones driving up
in the minibus from London.
Unfortunately they never
quite made it, after toppling
over on the M1 in Derbyshire.
Luckily the only injuries
where to Nick, his laptop
and a throwline. The police
obligingly rescued the cans
of beer, which had rolled out
of the broken rear window all
over the motorway. Tim’s dad
came to the rescue, complete
with a trailer for the boats.
They all spent the night in
Doncaster watching DVDs
and reducing the volume of
the rescued beer bucket.
Alice also never quite made
it, electing to drive up with Jon
the next day instead. Claire
and Robin were a little late,
so the only one who actually
made it to the agreed meet-
ing place on time was Harry
‘the most organised’, who
was delighted to be spending
time in a pub, so all was well.
The afternoon paddling plan
was abandoned due to lack of
boats and paddlers, so Harry,
Clare and Robin checked into
the hut.
On Tuesday morning, eve-
ryone finally met at Kettlewell
to paddle the Wharfe. Well,
not quite everyone. Alice and
Jon didn’t believe that we
would put in at 10am, so they
missed the boat. The water
was cold as predicted, and
Alexa kicked off the swim-
ming, but a pleasant paddle
was had by all. Theo and
Tim ran Linton Falls at the
Takeout with many specta-
tors.
As we went to the car park
to get changed, we were
greeted by Alexa’s dad, Jim,
with a huge fully equipped
motor home, providing shel-
ter from the rain and cups of
tea.Whatluxury!Themonster
van was thereafter referred
to as ‘Mission Control’. And it
seemed we would be needing
‘Mission Control’ assistance
a little longer, because in the
evening we discovered that
the RAC would not be provid-
ing a replacement van on the
Union breakdown insurance,
because they’d got us on a
technicality. Thanks a bunch!
The next day, everyone met
up at the Young Offenders
Institute in Barnard Castle at
9am. We didn’t see any young
offenders, but Jim P showed
up, released on parole from
his girlfriend. In the car park
Claire had a quick driving
lesson, then Theo, Jon, Jim,
Juergen, Alice, Alexa, Claire,
Robin, Tim and Harry ran
the Tees from Barnard Castle
to Wiston Bridge. Alexa had
a swim and decided to get
out at Whorlton, the halfway
point where ‘Mission Control’
handily intercepted her.
Afterwards we drove back
up and Theo, Tim, Jim and
Claire ran the upper sec-
tion from High Force to Low
Force. This should have been
called ‘gale force’, as we
were blown down the river.
Interesting bits included the
‘dog leg’ grade four rapid
and low-force itself (a 10ft
waterfall). Everyone ran the
drop, with Jim experiencing
complete submergence and
Claire playing with the stop-
per for extra excitement.
‘Mission Control’ ran out of
diesel, but thanks to some
navigational genius involv-
ing autoroute express, Nick’s
battered laptop and a digital
camera, Jon was able to get
to Darlington in the nick of
time to rent a new van.
On Thursday, we paddled
the Ribble, Helwith Bridge
(where we were staying)
down to Settle. Robin, despite
having very little paddling
experience, had managed
the previous day’s paddling
swim free. His luck ran out
at the start of this river. The
more technical sections
above the ‘two bridges’ rapid
caused him three swims in
short succession, culminat-
ing in a nasty tooth chipping
injury. Stainforth force pre-
sented a rather forceful look-
ing towback, and so only Tim
attempted it.
Muppetry meant we had
only one and a half throwbags
(with the M1 having eaten
at least a half), but luck-
ily they weren’t needed. As
Theo didn’t realise his digital
camera didn’t compensate
for daylight saving hours, he
sent Tim frantically paddling
ahead thinking he would miss
the last train from Settle to
Leeds. Harry had forgotten
dry clothes, and so we slung
him in the back of the van
with all the other wet gear.
He sat in pitch blackness,
and only after the journey
realised that the van had an
inside light.
On New Year’s Eve we
headed over to the Duddon, in
the west Lake District. This
was worth the drive, as it’s
one of the few English rivers
we have ever seen with crys-
tal clear water and grassy
banks. Emily got down every-
thing with good high braces
and handrolls.
After the river Rob unfor-
tunately ran over Nick’s foot.
Perhaps he decided that it
would be compassionate to
Theo to have a little accident
of his own. Nick was left hob-
bling, but nothing was broken
(it turns out just torn) and it
gave him a good excuse to
stay off the dancefloor that
night.
New Year’s Eve cel-
ebrations took place in the
‘Helwith Bridge’ pub, where
the local people made us feel
most welcome (a nice change
from Wales). In fact, Theo had
an interesting time with the
barmaid. The less said about
that the better. Suffice to say
he was glad Harry didn’t have
his camera.
The next day, we did a lot of
faffing around before finally
ending up at the put-in for
the Lune, at Teebay. ‘Mission
Control’ got a bit of scrape
on the way down the danger-
ously narrow lanes. Near the
end of the river, we encoun-
tered carnage on the strid,
with Robin deciding that
swimming the rapid would be
far more exciting than pad-
dling it. But no one was pad-
dling to full ability, due to the
hangover. A very pretty river
though.
Our final day’s paddling
was the Kent, where we met
Tim, Amie and Tim’s Dad,
Nic. The water was cold but
the levels were OK and eve-
ryone bimbled down most
things successfully. Theo
was comically backlooped in
the gorge section, but if he
insists on paddling a stupidly
small boat, things like that
are almost inevitable!
Right at the end of the trip
we all did Force Falls blind
for comedy value. After the
river, some set off on the long
journey home whilst Theo,
Tim and his Dad sneaked in
a quick descent of the nearby
Leven. The highlight of this
was backbarrow falls – a big
grade four that drops away
under a low bridge. Theo
made up for earlier muppetry
with the best line of the day.
They did get stranded at the
takeout for a while as Jeurgen
(driving the minibus) missed
the turning for the takeout
and tried to do a scenic tour
of the lakes.
Big thanks to Alexa’s dad
and Tim’s dad for lending
substantial vehicular sup-
port, without which we would
surely have made a disaster
out of a crisis. As it was, we
all enjoyed an excellent week
of Yorkshire paddling!
