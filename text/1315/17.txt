ELECTION INTERVIEWS elections@ic.ac.uk
DEPUTY PRESIDENT (CLUBS & SOCIETIES)
● The DP(C&S) is responsible for all the Union’s clubs, societies and student activities
● There are 2 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)
Why are you standing?
Basically I think that the clubs at
Imperial do a great job. So many stu-
dents are members of clubs and it’s
a fantastic service. The Union has
to be there to handle the bureauc-
racy and make sure the clubs can
do what they want to do. Having
been involved on the club side, I also
wanted to be involved on the Union
side and put something back in.
If you’re elected, how will you
make a noticeable difference
to students’ lives at Imperial?
My main aim is to be there for the
club officers. Hopefully if I do my job
well, the students should know noth-
ing about me. If I’m working effec-
tively, they shouldn’t have any cause
to moan and won’t hear about me.
What’s your view on the
redevelopment of Beit Quad
and its effect on clubs and
societies?
Some proposals have been made
to change the nature of the Union
gym, and this concerns me a lot,
especially as we’re going to be clos-
ing Southside in July and the Sports
Centre potentially could be late. I
don’t think we should change the
nature of the gym until we know for
sure we’re going to have somewhere
to put all the clubs.
Do you think there should be
a separate sabbatical officer
to deal with sports clubs?
That’s a very interesting issue,
because obviously the sports clubs
and the non-sports clubs have a lot
of differences. I don’t think we need
another sabbatical officer to deal
with clubs. The CSC chairs have to
work very hard to do the jobs that
they do, but I think they do them
really well.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
I think its important that we have
continuity. That’s why, in my
manifesto, I’m not really saying
that I’ll try to make huge changes.
But the one thing we really need
is online forms, online documenta-
tion – it would be so much more
efficient.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of Simon or RON?
Simon says he’d like to make sure
that every club or society has a
home. This just isn’t a feasible aim.
We only have a limited amount of
space and we have to make the
best of what we’ve got. I want to
run an organised and efficient sys-
tem to represent the clubs so that
their problems are dealt with swiftly
and they’re not waiting around for
things to get processed or to get
answers.
JAMES THATCHER
Why are you standing?
Mostly because it seems like a fairly
natural progression. I started off
as treasurer of the Science Fiction
society, and then I took over the
SCC treasurer role because it was
quite frankly crap and I thought I
could do the job better. Then I took
over the SCC Chair role, so I’ve just
been moving up, so to speak, getting
things better organised and mak-
ing things better for everyone else
around.
What’s your view on the
redevelopment of Beit Quad
and its effect on clubs and
societies?
It gives us a good opportunity, but
obviously we need to be careful,
because there’s going to be a big
problem with gym space. At the top
of the building, we could make much
better use of the space up there, and
renovation will give us the opportu-
nity to do that.
Do you think there should be
a separate sabbatical officer
to deal with sports clubs?
I don’t really think it’s needed. I
think if you have a separate sabbati-
cal for sports you’re just going to be
duplicating work and people aren’t
going to be working as efficiently
and effectively. Possibly you might
want some extra support to help
the ACC exec organise things, but I
don’t think we need an extra sabb.
One of your goals is to “see
every club have a home”. Is
that realistic?
It’s not entirely. It’s what my dream
would be, so to speak. Even if it’s
a room shared between five or ten
clubs, having a home just gives you
the stability so you can work with
your members and get them more
involved.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
Personally my goals are to make
an immediate impact and improve
things like room bookings, commu-
nication between clubs, and get the
whole system working smoothly.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of James or RON?
Voting RON is a bad option because
it just means that the elections have
to happen again, you’re unlikely to
get any new candidates, and you’re
just backing yourself into a corner
and making things worse. As for
James, the big difference is our
backgrounds – he has very limited
and narrow experience, whereas
I’ve got a much better track record
of getting things done and a much
broader experience of things around
the Union.
SIMON MATTHEWS
Why are you standing?
I’m standing because I’m eager to
have an input in the Union. I’m an
international student myself, I’ve
depended quite a lot on the services
of the Union, and that’s why I’m sen-
sitive to students’ needs in general,
concerning their welfare and their
education. I’ve been a rep, and I
think students have the right to be
involved and say what they think.
How would you address the
recent problems with exam
and lecture timetables?
Concerning exams, the problem this
year was mainly with aeronautics,
because the exams were straight
after the Christmas holiday, which
was really short. I can make chang-
es for the future, but not for the next
few years because term dates have
already been set, As for lectures
being at the wrong time of day, I
think this is an issue that has to
be dealt with. It’s important that
students get a break during the day,
and I’m sure there’s another times-
lot apart from lunchtime that can
be used.
What are your views on hall
rents?
I think hall rent increases have to
be fair, and my vision of fair is that
all halls should increase in the same
way. I think students should have a
say on whether they want an expen-
sive or a cheap room.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
I want to galvanise the dep rep
scheme.
How would you do that?
Firstly I need to make sure that dep
reps are enthusiastic about being
dep reps, because their job is to get
feedback from students. Students
aren’t really that responsive, some-
times they’re shy, so I think it’s
important that dep reps go up and
ask them and make sure every-
thing’s OK, otherwise they won’t get
that feedback.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of Aleks or RON?
Because I think I am determined
enough, I’m a very friendly and out-
spoken person, and I think people
need to have a connection with the
person doing that job.
SARAH KHATIB
Why are you standing?
I’ve used the welfare system before,
and I’m quite confident so I know
who to talk to. Not everyone is confi-
dent, and not everyone knows what
is there. I want to make people more
aware, and I think I can do that.
You say you “would like to
see more subjects introduc-
ing reading weeks”. Why?
I think people might pick up on that
wrong. What I really meant was not
necessarily a reading week as such,
but more time to prepare for exams,
because you can’t do well in exams
when you haven’t got time to pre-
pare for them. That affected me this
year, and I was just outraged.
If you had a reading week,
wouldn’t you have to lose
some lectures as a result?
No. If the lecturers plan their time
well, then there’s no problem with
it, surely.
If you’re elected, how will you
make a noticeable difference
to students’ lives at Imperial?
Having more time to do their work
would make people less stressed,
and they’d enjoy themselves more.
People need to realise that the
Union is there for them.
What are your views on hall
rents?
I think the students should be able
to choose what price bracket they’re
in. Costs should be different across
the halls, but rents shouldn’t be
based on students’ ability to pay
– there are so many grants out there
for students if they need them.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
I’d like to see more awareness for
disabled people and people with
learning disabilities, because it’s
pushed under the carpet a bit. I’d
also like to get more postgrads
involved within the Union.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of Sarah or RON?
I’ve been working at the Union for
four years and I know a lot of differ-
ent people throughout the College
to talk to, not just students. They
should vote for me because I’m going
to be better! I’ve got fantastic people
skills and I’m well organised.
