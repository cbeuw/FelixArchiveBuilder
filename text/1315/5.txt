The Hubble Space Telescope,
arguably the greatest scien-
tific instrument in the history
of space exploration, may only
have three years of life left
after plans to mount a rescue
mission were recently shelved
by the US government.
A combination of safety
issues associated with a
manned rescue mission and
a change in US space policy
were cited as the two main
reasons why the US will
allow Hubble to naturally
wind down.
The next servicing mis-
sion, scheduled for 2008, was
intended to upgrade Hubble’s
batteries and gyroscopes,
allowing it to function for
another eight years. Manned
repair missions are not new
to the telescope, with three
successfully completed since
its launch in 1990. However,
in the wake of the Columbia
disaster, NASA grounded all
threeofitsremainingshuttles,
putting the shuttle flight to
service the telescope on hold.
NASA contemplated using
robots to carry out the repairs
and, until recently, plans were
being developed in collabora-
tion with the Canadian Space
Agency to launch a robotic
servicing mission in 2007.
Last month, however, the
US government refused to
release the $1 billion needed
for the upgrade. As a result,
the Hubble space telescope
will continue to function nor-
mally in the short term, but
without the repairs to its bat-
teries and gyroscopes it will
eventually wear down in three
years.
The decision not to extend
Hubble’s life beyond 2008 has
been seen by many as rash
and unnecessary. The infor-
mation provided by the tele-
scope during its distinguished
career has contributed mas-
sively to our knowledge and
understanding of the Solar
System, the Milky Way and
other more distant galaxies.
The staggering beauty of the
images obtained by Hubble,
ranging from kaleidoscopic
swirls of gas to jaw-dropping
pictures of the birth of stars,
have become ingrained in the
public consciousness. This
information has also allowed
us to probe deeper and ask
more questions than anyone
thought was possible when
Hubble was first sent out on
its journey of exploration.
Even now Hubble continues
to amaze, with the recent dis-
covery of 100 new planets in
the centre of our Milky Way
galaxy, doubling the number
of planetary bodies known to
orbit stars similar to our own
Sun. Not wanting to rest on
their laurels, NASA was plan-
ning to extend Hubble’s capa-
bilities by adding several new
components during the next,
and now cancelled, upgrade.
One of these new components
is a camera designed to detect
a particular type of faint UV
light that acts as a signature
for trace gases present when
the universe was still young.
It is against the backdrop of
this impressive list of achieve-
ments that the discussion of
Hubble’s fate is being con-
ducted.
Naturally, the decision has
provokedstrongopinionsfrom
those passionate about saving
Hubble. The pro-Hubble cam-
paign is being championed
by a wide range of people
and interest groups, includ-
ing the influential American
Astronomical Society (AAS),
theNationalResearchCouncil
(NRC) and genuine grass-
roots Hubble enthusiasts who
have set-up websites such
as www.savethehubble.com.
This website and numerous
ones like it are scoring huge
numbers of hits, a testament
to the telescope’s popularity.
As a result of this pro-
Hubble pressure and numer-
ous online petitions, NASA
asked the NRC to investigate
ways in which the Hubble
could be rescued. Late last
year the NRC reported back
and came down in favour of
a manned shuttle mission,
asserting that it was the only
way to accomplish all the nec-
essary repairs with minimal
risk to the crew. According to
the NRC, the current state of
robotic technology is not up
to the job and could be more
risky to the Hubble itself. The
study concluded that robots
should only be used to de-orbit
the telescope at the end of its
working life, by which time
robotic technology should be
advanced enough to carry out
the task. In the meantime,
the NRC, the AAS and others
are concerned that a premier
piece of astronomical real
estate will be cast off while
still in its prime.
Arguablythemostimportant
factor influencing the decision
not to save Hubble is the cur-
rent US policy towards space
exploration. Lying at heart
of this strategy is President
Bush’s desire to send men
and women back to the Moon
and, eventually, to Mars. The
so-called “moon-to-mars ini-
tiative” requires enormous
funding and will take several
years to implement. President
Bush has already asked NASA
to re-allocate $11 billion for
start-up costs, with an extra
$1 billion to come from the
government.
The International Space
Station (ISS) will play a key
role in the “moon-to-mars ini-
tiative,” mainly as a refuelling
depot for the longer journey to
Mars. The space shuttle pro-
gramme will also be crucial
in this respect, at least until a
new generation of spacecraft
is developed. NASA already
plans to send the first shuttle
since the Columbia tragedy
to the ISS later this year, a
decision which is causing con-
fusion among those wanting
to keep Hubble operational:
If NASA is content to send
shuttles to the International
Space Station, why are they
so reluctant to use them for
a tried-and-tested journey to
the Hubble?
If the US government sticks
to its decision to veto funding
for a Hubble repair mission,
theobviousquestionbecomes,
what, if anything, will one day
replace Hubble?
Currently, no earth-bound
telescope is capable of emu-
lating the sheer image qual-
ity Hubble routinely produc-
es. Interestingly, plans are
underway to build a space-
bound successor to Hubble,
called the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST), which is
due for launch in 2011. The
JWST’s primary goal is
to peer back to events that
occurred not long after the
Big Bang, specifically when
early galaxies started to form
and evolve.
Another important objective
of the JWST is to determine
the nature and amount of
dark matter in the universe.
Dark matter is the mysterious
substance that cosmologists
believe accounts for the dis-
crepancy between the amount
of matter we can detect and
the total amount that must
exist to create enough gravi-
tational force to prevent the
universe from flying apart.
Despite the impressive ambi-
tions NASA has for the JWST,
critics still argue that the
delay between the expected
end of Hubble and the launch
of the JWST will be too long.
It is generally accepted
that Hubble cannot con-
tinue forever, and that more
advanced telescopes like the
JWST will eventually replace
it. But many are convinced
that the decision to effectively
axe Hubble is premature and
unwarranted. In the eyes of
astronomers, this decision
is being made by faceless
bureaucrats sitting behind
desks who are unaware of
the potentially great science
that Hubble could still achieve
with just a little fine tuning.
Ultimately, the decision will
rest with those in control of
the purse-strings, but it is pos-
sible that support from grass-
roots fans, as well as influ-
ential astronomical organisa-
tions, will make NASA and the
US government think twice
about axing the telescope.
In the meantime, Hubble
will continue to enthrall us.
How sobering it is to think
that those beautiful, ethereal
images that we seem to take
for granted may, in as little
as three years, be a thing of
the past.
