Although we know that right
and left-handed people have
co-existed since the Upper
Palaeolithic era (15–10,000
BC), little is known about the
distribution of left-handed-
ness or why the trait persists.
While scientists believe hand-
edness is mostly inherited, it
is not so clear what the evo-
lutionary advantages associ-
ated with being left-handed
are. A new study recently
published in Proceeding of
the Royal Society (Biological
Sciences) may offer a piece of
the puzzle.
Researchers Charlotte
Faurie and Michel Raymond
of University Montpelier in
France claim that there is
a strong, positive correlation
between the frequency of left-
handers and the rate of mur-
der in traditional societies.
The study draws on pre-
vious results from sports
studies in Western societies,
which show that left-handers
have an advantage in con-
frontational sports, such as
tennis, fencing, baseball, but
no in non-interactive sports.
Further, this advantage is
frequency-dependent, mean-
ing that left-handers enjoy a
greater advantage over their
opponents when they are in
the minority.
Since physical sports can
be seen as a modified form of
fighting, a wider ethnological
interpretation may be made
that links handedness to
aggressive behaviour. Faurie
and Raymond speculate that
being left-handed in a violent
context would be advanta-
geous, therefore there would
be a higher frequency of
aggressive left-handers.
The research supporting
this hypothesis is comprised
of studies of several so-called
traditional societies (like
Cameroon, Burkina Faso,
Gabon). In each case obser-
vations were made on the
hand preference for activities
such as holding a machete
or knife and bow-shooting,
which were correlated with
homicide rate data. Western
societies were not considered
because the violence in these
societies mainly involves the
“use of long-range and pow-
erful weapons” which are not
thought to offer left-handers
an advantage.
WhileFaurieandRaymond’s
results support their hypoth-
esis, it is clear the studies’
scope is not sufficient to draw
any definite conclusions.
Besides, as the authors con-
cede, homicide rate is not the
best estimator of the preva-
lence of one-to-one fights.
It would also be interesting
and more authoritative to
see the research extended to
Western societies with larger
test samples.
The study does, how-
ever, highlight the potential
importance of violence in
understanding handedness
in humans. Since most left-
handers are male, it seems
possible that there may be
a “fighting advantage” asso-
ciated with left-handedness,
which would confirm that the
trait is preserved. Yet this
need not be the only advan-
tage in the handedness bal-
ance.
During the 20th century
there was a popular theory
backed by a number of stud-
ies that related left-handed-
ness to creativity. Having had
the opportunity to verify this
theory with a sample of my
own in a high school science
project, I wonder whether
creativity may be one of those
other benefits. Although such
differences due to handed-
ness are well-known, their
causes, thought to be relat-
ed to the organisation of the
brain, are still unclear.
Hopefully, Faurie and
Raymond’s study is a step
forward in our understand-
ing of left-handedness and
its perseverance as a trait.
But one should be wary of
correlations. The two studies
could, for instance, be inter-
preted together to prove the
existence of a positive corre-
lation between creativity and
homicide.

in brief
Air force war game
aims to test space
technology
The US military launched a
five-day war game last week
to see how space-based
assets like satellite commu-
nications and precision bomb
guidance systems would fare
in a war against terrorism in
2020. Over the past decade,
the US military has come to
rely heavily on satellites to
relay communications, trans-
mit high-resolution imagery,
track US forces, spot enemy
missiles and guide precision
munitions to their targets.
Life flourishes at
crushing depth
Tiny single-celled creatures,
many previously unknown,
have been found at the deep-
est point in the world’s oceans,
almost 11km down. The soft-
walled foraminifera, a form
of plankton, were recovered
by the Japanese remote sub-
mersible Kaiko. Yuko Todo
and colleagues report that
the organisms have become
adapted to the crushing pres-
sures (about 110,000 kilopas-
cals) that exist in a location of
the Marianas Trench known
as Challenger Deep.
Nanotechnology
takes aim at
transistors
US scientists have made
nano-scale devices they claim
could one day replace current
transistor technology. The
tiny devices known as “cross-
bar latches” are made up of a
combination of crossed-over
platinumwireswithstericacid
molecules set at their junc-
tions. The Hewlett Packard
researchers said they could
potentially do a better job
than current transistors, dra-
matically improving the per-
formance of computers.
Dyslexic drivers
slower to react
Dyslexia slows a driver’s reac-
tion time as much as moder-
ate drinking, a report claims.
A Norwegian study on 17 vol-
unteers found dyslexic drivers
took 30% longer to react than
others. Driving over the UK
alcohol limit slows reaction
times by 10%, according to
New Scientist. Charities said
the report was alarmist and
offensive, and that quick reac-
tion times do not necessarily
make good drivers.

The news this week: man
convicted of assault after
brawl with Egg McMuffin,
Russian combat jets scram-
bled to repulse cloud, image
of Jesus seen in frying pan,
teenager who sent 100 texts
a day unable to move thumb,
and, finally, nude jogger
caught and locked up for one
year.
New technology may now
mean you can carry out your
lab work in the comfort of the
Union Bar. Imagine it: while
your supervisor’s running
around like a headless chick-
en trying to find where you’ve
gone, you will be in the pub,
sipping a pint of your favour-
ite ale, playing Who Wants
To Be A Millionaire and
monitoring your experiment
by mobile phone. Smoothly
does it.
This is exactly what
chemists in Southampton
University have been doing
as part of a national e-Science
project (except I don’t know
whether they were drink-
ing ale). Sensors in the
laboratory pick up sudden
changes in experimental con-
ditions and relay the infor-
mation to scientists’ mobile
phones. In this way, experi-
mental conditions are con-
stantly monitored so that
anomalies in temperature,
for example, are duly taken
into account.
It might be a long time
before experimental condi-
tions can be completely con-
trolled remotely, but the new
technology sounds promis-
ing. Having once spent three
hours a day for several weeks
staring at a read-out from a
Geiger counter, this reporter
would welcome any technol-
ogy that would relieve the
boredom during the long lab
hours some experiments
require.
More seriously, this week in
Felix Science we have a fea-
ture by Gaetano Mancino on
the Hubble Space telescope.
Looking back on some of the
images Hubble has produced
over the past decade, one
cannot fail to be stunned. It is
almost impossible to compre-
hend or appreciate the sheer
dimensions of the universe as
revealed by Hubble. We are
used to lifetimes of around
70 years, and the most we
travel to go anywhere on
holiday is a few thousand
kilometres. For us, 50 minute
lectures can seem like a life-
time, and a short trip through
London’s traffic can feel like
an endurance test. If Hubble
has taught us anything it is
that we are nothing in the
grand scale of things. So it is
a shame that this revolution-
ary apparatus of science is
being abandoned when it is
still producing such amazing
images.
Another article by Alex
Antonov looks at the possi-
ble link between aggressive-
ness and left-handedness.
Although his article refuses
to accept the findings, you
will read some interesting
conclusions about the ques-
tion of whether correlation
can prove causation. A few
of my friends are left-hand-
ed, and I can vouch for them
that they are not overly vio-
lent, although they are quite
creative.
Giovanna Larice looks at
the important issue of nip-
ples this week. Why do men
have nipples? Good ques-
tion. Research suggests the
answer lies somewhere in
between developmental foe-
tal biology and evolutionary
biology.

Events: Future Face
@ Science Museum
By Emma-Lynn Donadieu
and Robin Wilkinson
Science communication
The question “Who you
lookin’ at?” has taken on a
new meaning at the Science
Museum’s Future Face
exhibition, which considers
our perception of identity
through the human face.
We are all unknowing
experts at deciphering the
face. We can identify the
visage of a dead person as
human and are rarely fooled
by digital images or avatars.
The exhibits encourage us to
consider the significance of
the human face and our reac-
tion to it through an intrigu-
ing and visually captivating
blend of art and science.
There are a variety of
works ranging from strange
films of individuals shown
next to footage of them-
selves a decade previously
to Bjork’s bizarre robotic
music video.
There are also some good
interactive elements. If you
have ever wondered what
you will look like in 20 years,
or what you would look like
if you were a different race
then have a go on Dave
Perrett’s Interactive Face
Transformations and morph
your face (although based on
our predicted appearances
we’d like to dispute the accu-
racy). It was, however, one
of the lighter moments in
what is a dramatic, thought-
provoking and sometimes
disturbing exhibition.
If none of the above have
piqued your interest, then
it’s worth going to see the
mug shot of Wacko Jacko.
Some of the digital images
look more realistic than he
does.

showing at the Science
Museum until this
