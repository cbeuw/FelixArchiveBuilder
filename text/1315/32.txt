“Hey there students! Working hard? I hope so. College is
an important part of growing up. Going to College was the
best thing I ever did... apart from that German chick I met
at the Love Parade back in ‘87. Man, could that girl go!
Seriously though, College is important. Personally, I went
to DCL, David’s College of Life! And that’s where you guys
are going too, for one week only. I’m an international
superstar. I singlehandly brought down the Berlin Wall. I
just speak the truth and if I help some people with their
own pathetic little lives at the same time, then that’s just
great! There’s three points if you can work out who has
each problem, and what their problem is.”

Embarrassing brother
Hey David,
I’ve found it hard to talk about my
problem, I don’t think anybody takes
it seriously. Please, let me explain.
My family has always had a rough
time of it, with people gossiping
behind our backs, calling us names,
that kind of thing. My parents had a
messy divorce, as they’d both been
cheating on each other. A few years
later, my mum died.
Every since it happened though,
my little brother just hasn’t been the
same. He started hanging around
with the wrong type of people,
going to parties, that kind of thing.
Gradually, over time it’s just got
worse and worse.
He drinks far too much, and ends
up fighting with random people out-
side clubs. Dad always finds out. He
smokes too, I think he’s being doing
drugs. It’s breaking our Grandma’s
heart!
The final straw was a few week’s
ago. He went to a party, dressed
completely inappropriately. There
was a lot of fuss caused, and I got
the blame!
Life is so unfair, what can I do to
sort him out?
David Says: I’m afraid I’m pretty
sure I know what the problem is
here bud. Your brother’s a prick.
There ain’t too much you can do
about it. I think he’ll calm down a
little if he has to settle down and be
a dad. So until then, just encourage
him to have as much unprotected
sex as possible, with as many needy
women. That’ll sort him out!

Happy Valentines Day!
Drugs are bad, mmmkay
David,
I’ve just started a new relation-
ship, but nobody is supporting me!
I met him a few weeks ago, at a
party. I love to party, and so does
he. So we sat around and talked
about parties for a bit. Then I had
some coke, and we sat around and
talked about how amazing we both
are. Before that night, I’d never met
anyone as selfish and irresponsible
as I am. I thought, “he could be my
soulmate”.
I invited him to my birthday party
and since then our relationship
has just grown and grown. We’re
inseperable, apart from when I’m in
New York ‘working’, and when he’s
lying half dead in a drug dealer’s
living room.
My parents and my friends aren’t
so keen though. They think I should
know better. And they keep remind-
ing me that I have a child. Why do
they do that? I’m trying to forget!
How can I convince them that a
crackhead heroin junkie is the right
guy for me?
David Says: I did some crazy things
in my time. I remember the time
myself and KITT drove to Thailand
to find ourselves. Man, that whole
month is a blur. There’s a moral to
this story kids, and that’s never ever
trust that bastard KITT. Your crack-
head heroin junkie is fine though, so
have fun lady!
I’ve been a naughty boy
Hey Hoff-man!
I really respect you and your work
David, you’ve been such an idol to
me for so long. I love you.
I love lots of things. Zoos, fair-
grounds, a child’s naive smile, that
kind of thing. I’m just full of love,
some would say too much, but
they’re just ignorant.
I’ve had some health issues too
David, causing my skin to change
colour, my talent to dissapear and
my nose to fall off. It’s been pretty
hard going, but I’ve had my little
friends keeping me company.
But now, people want to stop me
playing with my friends!
It’s just not fair!
I’ve never done anything wrong or
inappropriate in my life. Not once
have I done something that I con-
sider ‘weird’, ‘perverted’ or ‘illegal’.
But people are telling me that I
have!
They say it’s wrong for me and my
buddies to have sleepovers. They
say that I’m not allowed to share my
bed with my best friends. They say
that I’m gonna be in big big trouble.
I’m a nice guy, why won’t people let
me be myself!
I don’t want to hurt anybody, I just
want to love them!
Why doesn’t anybody believe me?
I don’t understand!
David Says: Get out of here before I
slap you silly!
