Style, glamour, the most beautiful
locations in Europe and some of the
biggest names in Hollywood have
all been packed into this new film
by Steven Soderbergh. It’s the big
budget sequel to Ocean’s Eleven,
the aptly titled Ocean’s Twelve.
Adding in the promise of a little
intrigue, a dash of romance and a
twisty plot, you might think that
Soderbergh would have produced
a really great movie, but unfortu-
nately Ocean’s Twelve never quite
delivers the goods.
So Danny Ocean and his boys are
back. At the end of the first film, his
new-age gang of thieves disbanded
and went their separate ways after
stealing $160 million from lecherous
casino boss Terry Vincent, played
as slick and menacing by veteran
Andy Garcia. Now, three years later,
Vincent has tracked down all those
who stole from him and he wants
his money back, with interest, in
just two weeks. With no time to
spare, Ocean rounds up his old crew
and they head for Europe to steal
enough to save their lives.
What follows is a whirlwind of
planning and execution, as they
come up with inventive and origi-
nal ways of stealing their proposed
targets. At the same time, howev-
er, they are being watched by a
mysterious figure – the Nightfox
– a master thief himself, who could
turn out to be either friend or foe.
Also in pursuit of Ocean et al is
Isabel, a brilliant Europol investiga-
tor, who is determined to catch the
slippery boys in the act and send
them all to prison. She also has
to contend with ex-boyfriend Rusty
Ryan (Brad Pitt) who uses his con-
siderable charms to try to get the
better of her.
George Clooney reprises his role
as Danny Ocean, and brings class
and boyish charm to the lead. Brad
Pitt plays his right hand man to
perfection: making him the suave, if
slightly arrogant, master con artiste
and point man he needs to be. A cou-
ple of other well-known names such
as Matt Damon and Don Cheadle
are thrown in as well, with British
actors Eddie Izzard and Robbie
Coltrane in special guest starring
roles.
The ladies of this film, do their
very best to balance out the almost
overwhelming levels of testosterone
present, whilst also bringing a lot of
glamour to the screen. Julia Roberts
is Ocean’s long-suffering wife Tess,
who gets in on the action this time
around; and Catherine Zeta Jones
is the enigmatic Isabel.
The cast is, without a doubt, full of
first-rate actors, but with so many
stars present the film seems to be
cluttered with lots of two-dimen-
sional characters. This includes
Matt Damon, who comes across as
terribly inconsistent and is nowhere
near believable as Linus Caldwell,
the young pickpocket trying to prove
himself. The American comedian
Bernie Mac also appears, but his
comedicgeniusiscompletelyunused
by Soderbergh as Mac’s character is
left to languish in a Dutch jail for
almost the entire movie.
As the story progresses, we are
taken across the continent from
Amsterdam and Rome to the shores
of Lake Como, and all is done in lav-
ish style. The European backdrop
provides the film with the elegance
that is not often found in many of
today’s Hollywood offerings. The
soundtrack skips from contempo-
rary to classical with a bit of late
sixties retro thrown in to perfectly
offset each scene.
Soderbergh has wonderfully suc-
ceeded in choosing the perfect back-
drop for the story and the action that
is meant to follow; but it is here that
the film lets itself down – the plot
more or less sucks. It isn’t terrible,
just extremely weak – an initially
confusing plot eventually gives way
to some very predictable final twists,
taking two hours to do so. The end
dragged on miserably, attempting to
tie up all loose ends.
There was also hardly any tension
throughout the film, which is unu-
sual in this kind of production. And
the meticulous preparation for the
heists, which was what I had come
to expect from Ocean’s Eleven and
had made it that much more inter-
esting, was simply skimmed over
this time. It was also disappoint-
ing that the few action scenes were
erratic and short-lived.
Whilst there are some enjoyable
scenes in the film and no one part
of it is too terrible, it just seems to
lack any real substance and comes
across as no more than an excuse to
get a lot of famous friends together
in one movie. The cast is definitely
the main draw of the film, as any fan
will tell you. It was, in a word, fun,
but not something to write home
about. Mandirassa Osakonor

How many celebrities does it take to make a good movie?
Are you talkin’ about a sequel?
Recent reports in the press have
suggested that Robert De Niro and
Martin Scorsese have been dis-
cussing plans for a sequel to Taxi
Driver.
“I was talking with Martin
Scorsese about doing what I guess
you’d call a sequel to Taxi Driver,
where [Bickle] is older,” said Robert
de Niro, the star of the original
movie. Coincidentally, the National
Film Theatre are now screening
Scorsese’s 1976 masterpiece next
week, giving fans an opportunity to
watch it on the big screen.
This is a film about a lonely
Vietnam veteran, whose antipa-
thy towards the decadence in the
streets around him drives him to
undertake a violent mission to rid
the city of “the scum, the dogs and
the filth”.
Taxi Driver was Martin Scorsese
and Robert De Niro’s second
collaboration after the superb
Mean Streets. Thanks to its suc-
cess, the two went on to make a
series of legendary films such as
Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and
Casino. This is, without doubt, a very
important film.
Taxi Driver is one of those rari-
ties – an art-house movie that was
a complete critical and commer-
cial success. Nowadays, no mat-
ter how good a film is, it will not
reach a massive audience unless
its release is preceded by several
months of costly marketing and
advertising. Unashamedly commer-
cial films such as Ocean’s Twelve
make money and dominate the cin-
ema listings because of huge mar-
keting campaigns that condition
audiences into knowing what to
expect. Ocean’s Twelve is a good
bet for mindless entertainment,
therefore, it is a bankable movie for
a Friday night. Taxi Driver is the
opposite – your expectations will
inevitably be shattered, and your
response after seeing it will be
unpredictable.
Taxi Driver is a disturbing movie
in which every scene is designed to
capture the lead character’s oppres-
sive loneliness. Its famous “You
talkin’ to me?” scene, where De
Niro’s character has a gunslinging
competition with his own reflection,
has been referenced in movies such
as La Haine. The film ending and
plot has even influenced recent box
office hits such as Bad Santa. Most
famously, perhaps, there were calls
Taxi Driver to be banned after the
film inspired a real-life assassina-
tion attempt on the life of Ronald
Reagan in 1981.
In the current commercial climate
in the movie industry, I would not
be surprised one bit if they made
Taxi Driver II. A sequel to such an
influential film is guaranteed to be
a massive commercial success, and
nowadays, that in itself is a good
enough reason to make it.
