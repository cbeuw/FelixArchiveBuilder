Charity shops are where it’s at. That
and the Apple store. You see, as a
student, you should be minding the
pennies, as apparently most stuff
costs money. Like food, washing
products (the stuff your mum gets
you for Christmas) and most impor-
tantly beer, clothes and tickets.
It’s hard being a student, because
whilst sleeping is cheap, and very
easy to do, interesting stuff usually
costs money. Now there’s no way
around this, especially as shoplift-
ing is usually frowned upon (except
in BHS where they’re just glad to
see the stock out of the door at
last). So how do you cobble togeth-
er the money to afford that latest,
must-have pair of shoes? Or that
extra pint, or that pizza? By saving
money on the rest of your clothes
of course!
University is the only time when
it’s acceptable to wear old, not-
quite-retro-cool clothes and look
like a bedraggled sheep. You can
either buy the aforementioned stuff
in a ‘trendy’ shop for £££s or you can
buy it in a charity shop for only £s.
The best thing about living in
south west London is that the qual-
ity of clothing in the charity shops
is much better than average. It’s
pot luck admittedly, but quite often
you can find Ralph Lauren shirts
and so on mixed in between the
old ladies’ bras and massive pants;
though this is not a task for the
fainthearted. The more you look,
the more you’ll find treasures such
as an original Elton John LP
, or a
crushed velvet suit for £15. The idea
that you are wearing someone’s
dead grandfather’s kecks only trou-
bles you slightly for approximately
the rest of your life. Until you wash
them.
The best thing is that it’s all for
charity – like RAG. In other words,
you get to enjoy yourself and get
a fantastic bargain, whilst helping
out the unfortunate. Of course it
would be better just to donate, but
altruism really is dead nowadays.
Amongst those with no money of
course. Bill Gates loves donating,
but then he does still get all his
clothes from charity shops, so it’s
kind of obligatory.
So next time you want clothes,
take a gander at the fabulous stuff
in a charity shop (NB: Notting Hill
Charity has better stuff than Oxfam)
and amaze friends by your knowl-
edge of fashion trends when that
1920s tux you’ve been wearing for
a year suddenly comes back into
fashion. Another plus point is that
you can get absolutely trashed in
charity clothes and not give a toss
– it’s not like you paid £120 for a pair
of orange trousers that melt when
your mum “accidentally” irons
them. Do it, it’s for a good cause,
and because no-one likes seeing
your bum.
One man’s rubbish is another man’s
charity is another man’s treasure

Successive rejections can only make
‘Her storminess’ stronger. That’s
how I, the recipient of such declara-
tions to the point where they merge
into one, have got to a position at
which I find said experience comi-
cal, to say the least!
The performances put before me,
by these substandard village drama
society actors in the film reel of
university life, are comparable to
movie-oke (think karaoke in front
of a silenced movie picture) per-
formers break-dancing to a boudoir
scene. They compel me to laugh
out loud as yet another guy whose
intimate company I’d previously
enjoyed declares himself “not ready
to have a relationship”.
The giggling continues in order
to make him feel presumptive and
used, for assuming that I was so
enthused by his company that I
couldn’t live without it! Believe me
guys, ’tis wiser not to flatter your-
selves, as not every Asian female, or
female full stop for that matter, who
takes an interest in you is looking to
trap you into eventual matrimony, a
harem of children and the obligatory
weekend IKEA expeditions. Most of
us would rather (sensibly I might
add, given the quality of Imperial
men) play the field until someone
fitter, richer or more stimulating
comes along!
This brings us neatly to the subject
of this week’s column, entitled ‘aes-
thetic admiration of a sexual nature’,
or ‘perving over computer room
guy’. Perving is certainly an activity
we all partake in, especially if we fit
neatly into the two groups I relate
the best to – the single (I haven’t
had a boyfriend for three years, an
almost unachievable feat in a 70%
male institution) and looking (hav-
ing your two best friends fall in love
with capable, emotionally supportive
men, is definitely envy-inducing in a
girl who can’t keep a guy interested
in her for more than four hours).
Perving takes place on three levels
– the scan (to find whether there is
anything worth staring at), the pure-
ly physical (on the guys you find aes-
thetically perfect, but lacking in per-
sonality) and the holistical (where
intellectual and emotional attraction
interact with the physical). I’m sure
we’re all guilty as charged.
The ultimate form of superficial
flattery (from the beholder) is a great
way to make that essay in the com-
puter labs complete. Incidentally,
I have three guys who make my
mornings pass quicker (holistically,
of course; I don’t purely lust over
men with nicknames such as ‘the
body’) in said location.
One is cute and funny (I’d over-
heard him conversing with others
on a number of occasions – very
fine dry sense of humour there!)
with very bad teeth, hence better
viewed with mouth closed (if blond
surfer guys take your fancy). I’ve
been admiring him from afar for a
year or two – especially shocking
when you realise he’s a medic, and
medics are generally conservative
to the point of stone dullness.
One day, the very day I acquainted
myself with him, I overslept and
didn’t make it in to a lecture. Rather
productively, I decided to go and
work on my essay instead. I didn’t
get any work done, since said guy
was surfing rathergood.com and
realised I needed to burn my essay
onto a CD, since I’d recklessly
broken my A-drive whilst getting
busy on my desk with the conquest
responsible for the best movie-oke
performance the previous week. I
find younger men tend be better
looking, more passionate in bed, and
far more authentic in their blub-
bering, so I tend to seek these out
for a quick fling or ten. Back to the
point of interest, who, incidentally,
happens to be a second year student
– computer room guy.
Scary, but true: I didn’t know how
to burn a CD off a university compu-
ter at that point. Perfect, convenient
timing to pounce on my prey – the
only other person in the room.
“Excuse me, I’ve been trying to
burn a CD, but the drive doesn’t
read. Do you have any idea what I’m
doing wrong?”
“Show me what you’ve done.”
I bent over, leaning over him so my
breast barely touched his shoulder,
and showed him exactly what I’d
tried. He tried figuring out what to
do, whilst attempting to chat me up.
Excellent.
“Were you at the Velvet Revolver
gig on Tuesday?” he asked.
“Yes, thought I’d saw you there.
Amazing wasn’t it?”
“Yeah, brilliant stuff. Didn’t think
Scott had it in him at this age.”
“Who did you go with? My mate
said she’d seen you with an older
woman.”
“Ah, that’s my mother. She thought
she’d take me out to dinner... and I
had a spare ticket. She had a wicked
time.”
He blew it then and there. This
was too wrong to be true – nobody
takes their mother out for a night of
complete decadence and debauch-
ery. I looked at him, shocked beyond
belief, and he smiled, in the mis-
taken belief that I’d find such a
repulsive concept adorable, reveal-
ing the dirtiest mouth I’d ever seen
on a non-pensioner. I didn’t want to
hang around to find out whether his
breath was similarly odious.
“That’s nice.”
“I can’t figure out how to fix this for
you. How about you go to the techni-
cian’s room?”
“Sounds like a plan. Thanks.”
“I’ll see you around sometime,
yeah? My mate’s band is playing a
gig next week – I’d love to catch up
with you again.”
Oh shit. He fancies me. Excuses,
excuses – hurry up and think of
something, girl!
“I’m a bit busy with exams, but
I’m sure we’ll bump into each other
sometime soon. I’m in a bit of a rush
right now, so take care...”
Stormy Woods has never been
an athlete. Not until now, anyway.
Linford and his lunchbox would’ve
had trouble keeping up with me as
I legged it the hell out of there, run-
ning myself cleavage-first into my six
foot tall and increasingly handsome
crush of three years and counting:
biology trouser guy. Masturbation
material personified. Stormy has
landed.
