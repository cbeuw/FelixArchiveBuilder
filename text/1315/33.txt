Greetings, cruciverbovoracists!
Carrying on with thematic puz-
zles, this week all the across clues
are undefined but are of a kind. The
theme is not altogether unrelated to
the one in my last puzzle and should
be easy to guess. Note a peculiarity
of 26 across which ‘turns a corner’
into 27down, hence is only seven let-
ters (a word length otherwise una-
vailable in this grid).
I had a feeling most of the clues
were a bit dull, so if you do enjoy any
in particular, please write in to cheer
me up. Good luck! Jabberwock
