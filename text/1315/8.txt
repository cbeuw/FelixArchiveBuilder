Bought a tracksuit from a mush in
Shepherds Bush
Ever bought something from a
shop, got it home and realised that
it doesn’t work? Ever had trouble
with a product that has caused dam-
age to your house? Ever bought
something that has turned out to be
unsafe?
I am sure that some of these state-
ments will ring a bell with some of
you out there. Buying goods of any
kind is often enjoyable, but there
are times when you buy something
and it goes wrong. In this situation,
it always good to know what your
rights are and what action you can
take to get your money back.
The Information and Advice
Centre can help in this situation,
by making you aware of what you
can do. We can also act on your
behalf if the people you bought the
faulty product from are treating you
unfairly.
If you buy anything from a shop,
catalogue or even the internet and
there’s something wrong with it,
you’ve got a right to do something
about it. But this doesn’t apply to
changing your mind when you’ve
decided you really shouldn’t have
bought a minidisc player when your
rent is due any day now.
What does the law say?
One of the most important laws gov-
erning your rights as a consumer
is the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Like
many laws, it has evolved to keep
up with changes in society so the
Act now includes ‘amendments’
called the Sale and Supply of Goods
Act 1994 and the Sale of Goods
(Amendment) Act 1995.
This is a wide-ranging piece of
legislation that applies to both new
and second-hand goods.
It protects consumers by ensuring
that goods are:
● of ‘satisfactory quality’ – products
must last a reasonable time and be
free of defects
● ‘as described’ – a trader or adver-
tisement must honestly describe the
product. If, for example, you buy a
CD that turns out to be counterfeit
then you have a case against the
trader that sold it.
● fit for purpose – products must do
what the supplier says they do.
If you buy something that doesn’t
meet any of the conditions stated
above, it’s your right to demand your
money back from the trader (the
person/shop who bought it from),
not the manufacturer, wholesaler or
importer.
Traders also have a duty to
supply products that are safe. If
they knowingly supply unsafe
goods, they are committing an
offence. If you buy an unsafe prod-
uct, contact your local Trading
Standards Office, who will investi-
gate the matter and prosecute the
trader if necessary.
If the faulty goods cause injury to
yourself or damage to your property
of more than £275, you may be able
to claim against the manufacturer
or importer under ‘product liabil-
ity’ rules set out in the Consumer
Protection Act 1987.
Just as importantly, you have no
grounds for complaint under these
terms if you:
● were told about the fault when
buying the product
● inspected the product and should
have noticed the fault
● damaged the product yourself
● bought the product by mistake
● have changed your mind.
Services, such as those provided
by tradesmen and professionals, are
covered by the Supply of Goods and
Services Act 1982. Service providers
have a ‘duty of care’ to those they
work for and work carried out must
be ‘to a reasonable standard at a
reasonable cost.’
If you feel you’ve been over-
charged, you have a right to pay
what you think is a ‘reasonable
price’ (what you would expect any-
body else to do the job for), although
you may be sued for the full cost by
the provider.
Buying goods from home
You’re protected under consumer
legislation wherever you choose to
shop, but there are specific rules
that affect products you buy from
your home.
It’s much easier now to buy things
from home, compared to the past.
Besides catalogues, mail order firms
and buying online, you can be visited
by salesmen selling everything from
vacuum cleaners to double glazing.
You can’t always see what you’re
buying, so the need for an effective
way to sort out problems is probably
much greater than when you shop
on your local high street.
You have special rights as a home
consumer under the Consumer
Protection (Distance Selling)
Regulations 2000.
You are entitled to:
● Clear written information on prod-
ucts before placing an order
● A ‘cooling off period,’ usually
five days, when you can cancel any
order
● A full refund if goods or services
aren’t provided by an agreed date or
within 30 days
● Protection against credit card
fraud
If you’ve got a problem with some-
thing you’ve bought, then:
● Inform the supplier quickly and
let them know why you’re complain-
ing
● Keep a written note of any phone
calls or emails.
If you feel that you’ve entered into
a contract that, on reflection, seems
to be unfair, you have protection
under the Unfair Contract Terms
Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in
Consumer contract Regulations
1994, even if the ‘cooling off period’
has expired.
If you receive unsolicited goods
– items that you haven’t ordered
– you don’t have to return or even
pay for them under the Unsolicited
Goods and Services Act 1971.
If a trader demands payment for
such goods, they’re committing a
criminal offence under this law.
The goods in question become your
property if you keep them for six
months, or one month if you have
contacted the supplier. At this point,
you’re probably hoping that some-
one sends you an unsolicited laptop
computer!
Buying online
When buying online, you’re entitled
to the same rights covering any
other home purchase.
A website must display:
● Clear information about goods or
services before you buy
● Written confirmation of any order
● A ‘cooling off period’ allowing the
buyer to cancel the order for any
reason.
One exception to these rules are
products purchased through an
online auction. Auctioneers aren’t
required to accept responsibility for
the quality of goods on sale, so extra
care should be taken when buying
from them.

tion on this article or would like to

ADVICE SERVICE
NIGEL COOKE
STUDENT ADVISER
Sorry for the somewhat random
topic this week but I’ve been a lit-
tle busy with the ‘e’ word that some
people are currently getting excited
about.
I spent last night at the Silwood
Park campus, where they were
having a General Committee meet-
ing. The meeting itself was quite
valuable for me, though attend-
ance was somewhat thwarted by
Chinese New Year. It was also sup-
posed to be an informal opportunity
for Silwoodians to meet sabbatical
election candidates. Unfortunately,
interest was quite low until later
on, by which time only a minor-
ity of candidates together with Sam
Rorke and myself had survived. And
that’s when the fun started.
We joined some of the Silwood stu-
dents in one of the (nicer) kitchens
in the on-site accommodation. The
very nice Silwoodians offered us
some lovely pancakes, and Sam and
some of the Felix Editor candidates
seemed to be thoroughly enjoying
themselves. I was floating between
various students (both Silwood and
South Kensington) answering ques-
tions on student finance, the Union,
the College, my pilot’s licence…
Perhaps somewhat inevitably, the
most memorable part of the evening
was in the bar, for all the wrong
reasons. No, there wasn’t a strong
rugby crowd getting undressed.
There was, however, a chap called
Gideon. I didn’t catch his surname,
but he seemed to be a fan of mine.
Being President, you do get used
to surreal experiences as a result
of your minor ‘celebrity’ status.
Especially after 18 months. But
somehow I still found Gideon a lit-
tle overwhelming. He kept telling
me how great he thought I was
(which is a nice sentiment but can
be overbearing) and wanting to
know who I thought he should vote
for. He also explained that he was
the oldest PhD student at Silwood
and that he would be going back
to Tanzania soon, where he was
expecting to be appointed Foreign
Minister after next year’s elections.
Apparently he isn’t sure who the
(Tanzanian) President will be, but
he’s sure he’ll be the next Foreign
Minister. He said he would then
drive the Tanzanian President to
Silwood to show him where he used
to study.
I remember all this rather vividly
because I ended up with Gideon’s
arm around me at three separate
times during the evening as we
repeated the same conversation.
He also kept pointing me out to
other people and hailing me as a
“great man”. He explained that he
had been worried he’d never meet
me. It seems that what he most
liked about me was my Felix column
which he would read, without fail,
every week.
Just in case anyone is under any
misapprehensions, I did take a lik-
ing to Gideon; I’m sure he’s a very
nice chap and he probably does
have a strong political pedigree
back home. I think he’d just had
a little bit too much to drink. (The
very nice barman explained that he
is not unknown on the ‘scene’.)
Anyway, I’m supposed to be
reminding you about elections. Vote.
Go to www.union.ic.ac.uk/vote, from
midnight tonight until Tuesday 15
February. Vote. Or else I’ll start talk-
ing about doughnuts again…
Union Council update:
Strategic Review
After several months of hard work,
the Union Executive has now
reached a unanimous agreement
on a draft Union Strategy to recom-
mend to Union Council at its next
meeting on 17 February. I look for-
ward to the debate, and its adoption
as policy. It is vitally important that
we establish a consensus as to what
the Union’s role and priorities should
be, so that student officers can focus
on getting work done rather than
constantly arguing about what they
should be doing. The papers for the
meeting will be at www.union.ic.ac.
uk/meetings.
The next Council meeting will
also see by-elections for a vacancy
on the Council and for the post
of Equal Opportunities Officer.
All registered Imperial College
students may stand for election
and vote. For more information,
please visit www.union.ic.ac.uk/
