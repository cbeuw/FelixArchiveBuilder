Freethinking
Dear Editor,
In the midst of the surging religious
activism on campus I would like
to draw attention to an emerging
ICU club called the Freethinking
Community.
Over recent weeks the college’s
overactive religionists have been
in full swing, plastering the noti-
ceboards with posters advertising
numerous lunchtime debates. In a
particularly controversial event, one
member of the Christian Union pre-
sented a long monologue in which he
made a sweeping attack of Atheism.
In another event, people were invit-
ed to “grill a Christian”, and canni-
bals of the college rejoiced.
In response to such radical out-
bursts, some fellow non-believers
have begun to speak out against the
barrage of proselytising; in a previ-
ous letter one person even stated
that the religious zealots present a
“farcical appearance”, but in this
letter I would like to express some
support for the college’s religious
groups. Although their diverse
supernatural beliefs are unconvinc-
ing to me, I am impressed by their
community spirit, their positive
outlook on life, and their consid-
erable generosity. It is high time
that ‘non-believers’ of the college
united in such a way, and I think the
Freethinking Community provides
this opportunity.
The new club will not simply be
antagonistic to religious believ-
ers. Instead it has been given a
broad remit, allowing it to explore
any challenging issues that inter-
est freethinkers of the college. The
Community could broach many
pressing topics, and perhaps it could
help revive the college populace
from its near-fatal state of apathy.
All the best,

Dear Dave,
Apologies in advance for being a
whiney old fart, but does anyone else
feel as I do about the current state of
the Union Pots?
“Pots” (the beer tankards behind
the Union Bar) are an important
embodiment of the history of the
Union and a valuable historic record.
They catalog notable members of
Union folklore for the past century.
My complaints:
1) The valuable historic record
is not being maintained: I know of
several pots which have not been
engraved for more than a year
(Council Chair being a notable
example).
2) In my day, were you not to
return a pot to the bar at the end
of the night, you would be subject
to the most serious sanctions. One
Deputy President, who as the only
current 2 year DP should remain
nameless, has taken to storing the
tankard relating to his Office in his
office, in contravention of accepted
practice.
I feel it proper to remind this
particular sabbatical, that the pot
belongs not to him, but to the Union
and all other names engraved
hence. Should he persist in the rath-
er ungentlemanly practice of guard-
ing the pot thusly, he risks the wrath
of countless predecessors, some of
which are quite sturdy and formi-
dable.
So let’s treat this valuable archive
as such; keep it on display in the bar
for all to enjoy and maintain and
cherish it as it so richly deserves.
Or else.
Love and Hugs,
An Old Fart

To publish or not to publish
Dear Editor,
I was disappointed to read Iain
Heaton’s letter last week in which
he attacks your editorial skills and
the article that was published on
construction projects. Quite frankly
I find his letter “not that interest-
ing”, and suggest he disappears off
to run the election campaign for
his friend, instead of wasting much
sought after space in your quality
newspaper, with his drivel.
Yours sincerely,
Bob the Builder

Making poverty history
By Fen Beynon
Last Thursday saw Nelson Mandela
in Trafalgar Square, giving a speech
to over 22,000 people. The former
South African President, 86, recently
announced that he was retiring from
public life but said, “as long as pov-
erty, injustice and gross inequality
persist in our world, none of us can
truly rest”.
Make Poverty History, the UK
faction of the Global Campaign for
Action Against Poverty, had donned
the front of the National Gallery with
a huge white sign to set the stage for
this event, to which they invited Bob
Geldof, Oxfam’s Adrian Lovett, South
African Kumi Naidoo of the World
Alliance for Citizen Participation,
band Frititi, singer Jamelia and TV
presenter June Sarpong.
Mr Mandela, jailed for 27 years
under South Africa’s apartheid laws,
thanked the people of Britain for
their support and help “consigning
that evil system forever to history”
but followed on to point out that mil-
lions of people were still “trapped
in the prison of poverty”. The ways
in which we can help these people,
according to Mandela and the world-
wide campaign, are to ensure trade
justice, end the debt crisis for the
poorest countries and deliver more
and better aid.
The Millennium Declaration in
2000 had several aims. One of these
was “to halve, by the year 2015, the
proportion of the world’s people
whose income is less than one dol-
lar a day”. This year, in September,
world leaders will gather to meas-
ure the progress they have made
on the Declaration. Mandela stated
the obvious: “the promise is fall-
ing tragically behind. Those leaders
must now honour their promises to
the world’s poorest citizens.” Kumi
Naidoo pointed out, with a great
response from the crowd, that world
leaders could find billions of dollars
for an unjust war in Iraq but could
not honour their commitment to give
0.7% of their nation’s wealth in aid.
The Make Poverty History cam-
paign, a UK alliance of over 200
charities, trade unions, campaigning
groups and celebrities, believes that
2005 offers an exceptional oppor-
tunity for the UK to take a lead in
turning things around. This is due
to the combination of heading the
European Union and the hosting of
the G7 finance ministers meeting
and the G8 summit.
The Group of Eight (G8) nations
began in 1975 when the French
President invited the leaders of
Japan, the USA, Germany, the UK
and Italy to discuss the economic
problems of the day, later expand-
ing to include Canada and Russia.
It is up to the country holding the
Presidency to set the agenda and
organise the annual summit which
will be held in Gleneagles, Scotland
in July this year with the main
themes being Africa and climate
change.
Campaigners will surround the
site, as 70,000 did at the Birmingham
G8 in 1998, demanding an end to the
debt crisis. This public show led the
UK Government to make a signifi-
cant advance. All of the debt owed
directly to the Government by many
of the world’s poorest countries was
cancelled and funding was given by
them to help some other countries
cancel some of their debt too.
The day following the Trafalgar
Square rally, Mandela met the G7
(G8 without Russia) ministers, the
finance ministers of the world’s
seven richest nations, who have
backed UK Chancellor Gordon
Brown’s plans to cancel “the vast
bulk” of money owed by the poor-
est countries. Mr Brown said that it
would be remembered as “the 100%
debt relief summit” and also wants
to provide $10 billion a year for a dec-
ade, but needs G7 backing in order
to borrow the money up front on the
financial markets.
The UK also plans for an
International Finance Facility (IFF)
to help deal with debt, but the US
will not support it because of its
“legislative process” according to
US Treasury Under-Secretary John
Taylor, although they are “complete-
ly committed to poverty reduction
and providing financing to do that”.
This seems to be a hopeful start,
but Mandela calls for “action, not
words... with courage and vision”.
Despite the many promises from
rich countries, many of the poorest
countries are becoming still poorer.
Much of this is due to the fact that
they have to spend so much on pay-
ing back the interest on their debt
– in many cases, more per year than
they spend on health or education.
The Global Campaign for Action
Against Poverty calls for these prob-
lems to be rectified by trade justice,
rather than free trade, and a much
greater emphasis on giving more
power to the poor countries in mak-
ing decisions that will affect their
future.
Nelson Mandela believes that pov-
erty is not natural, just as apartheid
and slavery were not and that over-
coming it is not an act of charity, but
an act of justice.
