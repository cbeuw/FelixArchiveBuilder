FELIX EDITOR
● The Felix Editor is responsible for the editing and management of this newspaper
● There are 4 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)
Why are you standing?
Well, I’ve enjoyed reading Felix in
my first year, writing crosswords
and other articles in my second year,
and editing the books section in my
third year. So I feel it’s something
that I’d be very passionate about
and spend a lot of time on, and I’ve
got the experience to do it.
What is Felix’s role?
Constitutionally, Felix is supposed to
provide students with College and
Union news and that kind of thing.
But I think Felix would be better
serving the students if it not only
gave them the facts, but also some
different opinions about the events,
and why things going on at Council,
for example, are relevant to them.
What writing and editing
experience do you have?
This year I’m pleased to say that I’ve
taken the books section from non-
existence to a regular feature. I’ve
also edited Broadsheet, the Faculty
of Physical Sciences newspaper.
How would you attract more
contributors to Felix?
The thing to do is start off well. You
need to have a good base of writ-
ers at the beginning of the term,
to fire people up and kick-start the
opinion column process and the
comment section. I can use the net-
work of writers I’ve built up through
Broadsheet, Felix books and other
areas. There’s nothing quite like
being invited to write something.
Which is more important:
giving students something
to read or something to
contribute to?
I think it’s more important that Felix
is there for people to express their
views and develop some writing
skills. You can contribute in a lot
of different ways, whether it’s car-
toons, photography, reviews...
Would you go back to the A4
magazine style?
I’d certainly be tempted, because
it had some advantages, but I’d be
more than willing to subject it to a
survey over the summer and see
what people think.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates or RON?
Well, RON certainly doesn’t have any
experience in Felix, and I’m not sure
that Rupert does either. The other
two candidates have Felix experi-
ence, but perhaps they don’t have
wider editorial or financial experi-
ence. I’m the only candidate who can
provide Felix experience and wider
experience, through Broadsheet.
I’ve got the clearest policies and the
most attainable vision, and I’ll make
Felix into a newspaper that people
want to read and want to write for.
MARTIN SMITH
Why are you standing?
I’ve really enjoyed writing for Felix,
editing and just being involved in
the thing. I’ve realised that there’s
scope for improvement. As you can
see in my manifesto, I think I can
continue to push things forward in
Felix.
What is Felix’s role?
Firstly it’s there to inform and enter-
tain the student body. It’s also there
as a medium for freedom of speech,
so people can express themselves
through Felix. It also has a cen-
tral role in communicating what the
Union is doing for the students, and
especially in communicating what
clubs and societies are doing.
What relevant experience do
you have?
In terms of Felix, this year I’ve been
managing and editing the science
section, last year as well, and pre-
viously the film section. Also I’ve
been involved recently in managing
groups of writers for a new spinoff
from Felix in the future.
How would you attract more
contributors to Felix?
With the science section we’ve had
a very wide range of contributors.
I’ve organised that through week-
ly meetings, encouraging people
to express their views in an open
forum. As Editor I would gener-
ally try to engage the student body
– if students find something in Felix
they’re really interested in, they will
respond. It’s about being in touch
with the student Zeitgeist and the
issues of the day.
Would you go back to the A4
magazine style?
I think the decision was originally
made not just on the format but on
financial considerations as well. If
I was to make that decision in the
summer, I’d look at the finances and
then decide. I think the newspaper
format has gone down surprisingly
well.
Which is more important:
giving students something
to read or something to
contribute to?
I don’t think you can really compare
the two.
What’s the single biggest
change you’d make to Felix?
The single biggest change is that I
would encourage a broader group of
writers to write more humorously. I
think a phrase I’ve used was to be
more relevant in content and more
irreverent in humour.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates or RON?
First of all I’m the most experienced
section editor on Felix, so I’ve got
more experience than the other can-
didates. I think my aims are more
realistic, and I’ve got a proven track
record of delivering both humour
and serious content.
DARIUS NIKBIN
Why are you standing?
Mainly because I want to give some-
thing back to the students, and also
because I think Felix needs improv-
ing – more fun, more comedy, more
serious news and more opinions to
represent what the students are
thinking. Also because I want to be
a journalist and this would be great
work experience.
What is Felix’s role?
To inform the students about stuff
that’s going on in College and also
stuff that’s going on in the world
that’s relevant to students, and to
express students’ views.
What relevant experience do
you have?
I’ve written one front page story for
Felix, and I’ve also been published
in local newspapers and had work
experience at The Guardian. I’m a
really sociable person, unlike some
at Imperial, so I think I’d be good at
managing people.
You’ve had three years at
Imperial... what’s your opin-
ion of Felix during that time?
I really liked last year’s Felix. It was
a bit more light-hearted, and I really
liked the ‘Ash’s Voice of Reason’ col-
umn and the page 3.
Why have you never been in-
volved with Felix regularly?
I was so busy with other uni
stuff, and I didn’t realise that it’d
be something I’d like to do until
more recently. I haven’t contributed
recently because I’ve been ill a lot so
I haven’t been in College.
Would you go back to the A4
magazine style?
I personally don’t really have a pref-
erence – I think it would be up to the
students to decide, using a poll at
the end of this year.
How would you attract more
contributors to Felix?
I think if we had a special ‘come
and write for Felix’ day, people
could pop in throughout the day,
see what goes on, do whatever they
like, and if you get people interested
early enough, quite a lot of them
would carry on.
Which is more important:
giving students something
to read or something to
contribute to?
I think it’s much more important
to give people something to read,
because there are more people in
that category.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates or RON?
I think people should vote for Darius
if they like the science section and
want more science. If people are
scouts or they like origami then per-
haps they’ve got other people to vote
for. I seem to be the only one who’s
had actual newspaper experience.
RUPERT NEATE
Why are you standing?
I think there’s a lot that I could bring
to the position. I’ve been involved
with Felix for a while, and I’ve
always enjoyed working on it. Felix
is good at the moment, but there’s a
lot of potential for expanding it and
covering a lot more things that mat-
ter to the students.
What is Felix’s role?
To inform and entertain the stu-
dents, and allow them to tell one
another about what they’re doing
and what’s going on within their
Union. Also to give people some-
thing to get involved in, because the
contributors can get a lot out of it
as well.
What writing and editing
experience do you have?
I’ve been writing for Felix since I got
here. I’ve been editing the nightlife
section this year, which has involved
editing, layout and getting people to
write for me, trying to get as many
people involved as possible. I also
produced a Scouts newspaper last
summer.
You’ve had three years at
Imperial... what’s your opin-
ion of Felix during that time?
It’s developed from being an enter-
taining magazine into a full-blown
newspaper, and I’d aim to carry that
on and make it even better.
What’s the single biggest
change you’d make to Felix?
I’d like to see articles by or about as
many different people from around
the College as possible. There’s
huge diversity here, and at the
moment Felix doesn’t really cover it
all, for whatever reason.
Would you go back to the A4
magazine style?
I’d like to re-run the survey from
last year. Subject to that, my per-
sonal preference would be for keep-
ing it as a newspaper. I know there’s
a Union rule about having news on
the front page, and I don’t think that
would look particularly good as a
magazine.
Which is more important:
giving students something
to read or something to
contribute to?
Given that there are a lot more
readers than contributors, I’d
probably say something to read,
but they are both very important
things.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates or RON?
I’m in touch with the students, prob-
ably more than the other candidates,
and as such in a better position to
get more people involved, get more
contributions, and cover more of the
College community.
