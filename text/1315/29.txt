CLUB REVIEW
We pulled up to Fabric at 11.15 to
find a queue snaking miles around
the block. We immediately knew this
night was going to be a little bit
special.
For once, we didn’t have to worry
about the long wait in the cold and,
thanks to Nightlife editor Simon,
joined the much less daunting guest
list queue. A touch of blagging
was in order to extend my spot to
three people, but the chick with
the clipboard was won over by my
winning smile and we ventured
inside.
The night was getting more and
more promising when we swiftly
bypassed about 40 people in the
cloakroom queue, though I’m not
sure why – I was slightly dazed
and being led by the hand at this
point. We checked our coats and
that moment of imminent clubbing
excitement and nerves was upon
us. For those of you who know the
club, we came down the back stairs
into Room 2 – you really come in on
a high because the music is already
cranked and the crowd is dancing. I
was struck by how empty the place
was compared to the hundreds
waiting outside (over-enthusiastic
bouncers as always) but immedi-
ately headed to the bar to get things
rolling.
I’m not much of a drum and bass
fan, but I love my breaks and I was
there to check out the much lauded
Australian breaks wizard, Phil K.
Distinctive Breaks were doing their
monthly spot in room 2, and Phil K is
doing the next in their excellent Y4K
cd series, which has seen the likes of
Hybrid and DJ Hyper produce qual-
ity mixes.
Evil Nine were doing the warm-up
job and were banging it out a little
too early, in my opinion, their excel-
lent heavy guitar mix of Alex Dolby’s
Hazy Way straining the speakers at
11.45. There was little movement
on the dance floor and I was disap-
pointed by an act that I had heard
many good things about.
A few drinks later and 1am had
arrived. A feeling of expectation
swept the floor and the stuttering
beats of the Melbourne maestro’s
first tune hit the speakers. The
lasers came on and the party was
in full swing.
Phil K is regarded as one of the
most talented DJs around and now I
know why: layer upon layer of filthy
breakbeat shuddered the Fabric sys-
tem. Not a single missed beat or still
moment, just cranking it up tune
by tune. The basslines and hi-hats
kept us hypnotically on the floor,
boogieing away. Then he dropped
Prodigy’s Spitfire and the crowd
erupted. If you haven’t heard the
caustic breaks of the Prodge’s new
album, check it out!
The next hour or so went in a bit
of a blur and, before I knew it, Phil
K was winding things up with the
resonant, Jimmi Hendrix-esque gui-
tars of Andy Page’s Serpent – check
his Y4K for a choon and a half!The
rest of the night was spent equal-
ly between Hybrid, who were also
excellent, room 3 for a bit of the UK
hip-hop of Rodney P and Skitz, and
the stairs for a bit of breather! I met
many new and old faces and gener-
ally had my best night for a while.

CLUB REVIEW
The first thing I have to make clear
is that I didn’t get in to Defected, as
the security were being twats with
the guest list, but I do have some
recommendations to anyone who
wants to go.
Defected used to be at Ministry
of Sound once a month, then it had
a break over the summer. It went
back before Christmas, but there
was numerous problems. These
were mainly due to the huge turn-
outs – the place was apparently
rammed. Therefore, when they
moved to Pacha (a smaller venue)
for their album launch, they knew
it was going to be huge. And I mean
huge.
I turned up at about 9.30pm, know-
ing there was going to be a huge
queue, even for the guest list. The
main queue at this point was already
right round the other side of the
building, about 75m long. The thing
with the guest list queue that night
was that it wasn’t just a guest list;
people who had tickets were there,
they had a paying guest, a house
guest, the list went on. So, as you
can imagine, it was a complete free
for all. As the night was so popular,
they had decided to cut down the
press guest list. This cut included
me, so I wasn’t best pleased. Even
worse, instead of being given a
straight answer, I was just bumped
from queue to queue.
Anyway, enough of my whinging, I
wasn’t the only one this happened to.
People who had tickets were experi-
encing the same problem, being told
they couldn’t get in as there were
too many people. It’s acceptable, but
irritating. You can cut the guest list,
but when people have paid money
it’s just not good business to turn
them away. These problems would
never have had occurred if they
had predicted the size of the turn-
out for the night. To make matters
worse, the staff didn’t seem to know
what was going on either – there
were Defected staff and Pacha staff
all being told different information
about lists and where people should
be and whether they were paying.
This review, if you can really call
it that, isn’t a bitter bitch about how
I didn’t get in, it’s really just a piece
of advice to the organisers: ensure
that all the staff know what they are
doing and don’t employ people who
are there on a power trip.
Defected have become massive
recently, so any event they hold is
sold out a few weeks if not months
before the event. If you do have
tickets, I recommend getting there
early. Not just 20 minutes, I mean
at least an hour early. If you don’t
have tickets but are going to queue
to pay, I would say get there even
earlier because there is going to be
a big crowd. As for the guest list, this
is always a bane of every clubber’s
night out – whether or not you are
actually on the list, and if so, is the
bouncer going to be a dick? Pacha
has this weird system of a house list
and a club night list instead of just
having one nice alphabetised list.
If anyone actually managed to get
into Pacha then I hope you had a
good time, as it was meant to be one
of the biggest nights in the Defected
calendar. I would go again if they
were doing another party, but I’d get
there two hours early with a ther-
mos of soup, a ticket and perhaps a
small child to entertain me through
the boredom of waiting. Or even a
heavily overweight midget on a tri-
cycle. Yodelling. You know it makes
sense. Aaron Mason

BAR REVIEW
I count myself very lucky to be able
to live in such a nice area and be
so close to bars and restaurants of
a high quality. Cactus Blue is one
such place.
Located along the Fulham road
towards South Kensington station,
it’s got a kind of western (as in cow-
boy) feel about it. It spans over two
floors, the upstairs being the restau-
rant, which is nice but expensive.
Don’t expect change from £20, but
it is worth the money. It is an ideal
place to go if your parents are down
and they are paying, or if you want
to eat somewhere cool before going
out into London.
Cactus Blue one of those plac-
es where you just have to ignore
the fact that you just spent £7 on
a cocktail and soft drinks start at
£2. Champagne cocktails are also
£7 so it’s worth just drinking those
all night – it reminds you of what
is was like to not drink snakebite
just because it’s cheap and gets you
wasted.
The best thing about the whole
place is the fact that they have a tiny
lift for glasses. It was a cage in the
centre of the bar, which I have to say
has entertained me numerous times
when a little bit drunk.
Something else important is that
they ask for your credit card when
they take your order. This is for
security reasons, so if you’re think-
ing of doing a runner, don’t. The only
reason I say I this is because I have
thought whether it’d be possible to
run and grab my card and make it
out of the door. It’s not.
