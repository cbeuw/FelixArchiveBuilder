Why are you standing for
President?
Because I think I can make a dif-
ference.
What qualities would you
bring to the job?
I’m an experienced member of the
Union – I’ve been part of it since I
started at Imperial. I’ve taken an
active role in clubs and societies,
and I have management experience
from summer placements working
in industry. Also ICU is a big team
operation, and I’m able to motivate
staff and fellow student officers.
What’s the single most
important thing a students’
union can do for its
members?
Representation, because nobody
else can do it. The Union is the only
body charged with that responsibil-
ity.
Should Imperial College
Union be campaigning to
free Babar Ahmad?
Personally I think it’s an issue of
conscience. If the majority of stu-
dents are in favour of it, then we
should go for it.
What about other political
issues, such as ‘stop George
Bush’ or pulling British troops
out of Iraq?
Personally I think it’s a great idea,
let’s go and campaign for every-
thing... but it comes down to a ques-
tion of resources, and we have to use
our resources in the best interests
of the students. At the end of the
day, you have to do the sums, and
it might be better to put money into
staff than campaign against George
Bush.
The current President
claimed to work 100 hours
a week during the autumn
term. How would you manage
the workload?
It comes down to prioritising.
There’s an awful lot of work that
lands on the President’s desk,
and a lot of it is important, but I’m
sure some of it is not important.
It’s a case of choosing those things
that you actually need to do and del-
egating the rest as appropriate.
What are your views on hall
rents? Should they be based
on students’ ability to pay?
From the Union’s perspective we
need to argue for equality, and I
think in these terms that means
equal rent for equal accommoda-
tion.
In your manifesto, you say the
College must put students
first. How will you make sure
they do that?
By working with them, not against
them. I don’t think confrontation
benefits the students. We also need
to show them what we can do for
them – it’s not a one-way game. The
College need to put students as their
first priority but also need to under-
stand the Union can do things for the
College that the College can’t neces-
sary do as well for themselves.
How will you make your
manifesto pledges happen?
First of all, persuade people within
the current Union structure that
these pledges are worth delivering
on, then following through to make
sure they happen.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
Not to change anything unless I had
a good reason. I think, particularly
with the strategic review, there will
be a lot of changes arising, not nec-
essarily done in the best interests of
the students. It’s important to think
about whether changes will help
students before we make them.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
I’m competent, capable and com-
mitted to doing the job. What I think
sets me apart from the rest are my
skills as a leader, communicator and
team worker.
JAMES DEVINE
Why are you standing for
President?
I want to get a Union that the stu-
dents are proud of. I’ve got the
experience and the knowledge from
being a Deputy President this year.
I want to make sure that clubs and
societies don’t have the ridiculous
hassle of paperwork that we put on
them – it should be done online. I
want to ensure that the Union con-
tinues with the projects it’s started
this year, such as the refurbishment
project and the strategic review.
What’s the single most
important thing a students’
union can do for its
members?
Give them what they want, and
serve them in the way they want to
be served.
Should Imperial College
Union be campaigning to
free Babar Ahmad?
I think if students have a passion
for something then they should be
encouraged to follow that passion.
So if they have a passion for this
cause, they should be given advice
and helped to follow it. However, I
don’t feel that Union backing actual-
ly improves the situation in this case.
I don’t feel that having a Council
motion actually helps this cause.
What about other political
issues, such as ‘stop George
Bush’ or pulling British troops
out of Iraq?
At the end of the day, if students
have a passion for something, they
should be supported in terms of
advice and ideas, but the students’
union needs to be dealing with stu-
dents’ issues primarily.
The current President
claimed to work 100 hours
a week during the autumn
term. How would you manage
the workload?
I’ve already been a Deputy, so I am
capable of doing it, and I do spend
a lot of time working this year. The
fact that I have the experience and
the knowledge of deputising this
year means that I don’t need to
spend the time learning the job.
What are your views on hall
rents?
We need to ensure that the price of
accommodation doesn’t deter stu-
dents from living in our halls or com-
ing to our university. We also need
to ensure that there’s sufficient help
for students who can’t afford our
prices, such as by making sure there
are always options available to share
rooms to reduce the cost.
Should rents be based on
students’ ability to pay?
I think we need to look at the stu-
dents’ ability to pay, but we also
need to look at the bursaries and
help that are available.
But should richer students
pay more for the same quality
of accommodation? Yes or
no?
One thing I’ve found is that the
people who lose out in the system
are just on the borderline, paying
prices that are high and they just
about can afford. I think the issue is
that we need to ensure that financial
aid is available for students who are
unable to pay the higher prices.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
Improve the communication,
making it a more approachable
and proactive Union that’s positive
in getting things done and mak-
ing them happen. I want it to be a
students’ union that students are
proud of.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
Because I’ve got the experience
and the knowledge to make changes
happen. I’ve already proved myself
by fulfilling most of my manifesto
pledges from last year, even though
I’ve still got six months in office
left. I’ve played a leading role in big
projects that this Union is under-
taking, like refurbishment and the
strategic review. We need someone
who can hit the ground running and
continue these projects, rather than
having to learn them.
SAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN
Why are you standing for
President?
I’m standing because I want to make
a difference. Over the last three and
a half years that I’ve been here, I’ve
felt that people don’t get involved
enough with the Union, and I think I
can change that.
How?
First of all, I think the website and
Felix are underused for two-way
communucation. I think the sabbs in
their regular inputs to Felix should
make it clear what they’ve done
over the past couple of weeks, so
students know. Also, with the web-
site, it would be so easy to create
a forum where students can post
their comments and questions to the
sabbs. It wouldn’t take long to reply,
and I think it should be demanded
of sabbs to take 15 to 30 minutes to
sit down and answer questions from
the students, so people feel that
their queries are being answered.
What’s the single most
important thing a students’
union can do for its
members?
I think it’s got to be the represen-
tation, which I think is especially
important for our union. Not enough
people are interested, and the Union
can’t represent students’ views to
the College or cater for their opin-
ions and demands if students don’t
get involved.
Should Imperial College
Union be campaigning to
free Babar Ahmad?
In my opinion, no. I think political
issues that deal with things that
are directly relevant to students,
such as top-up fees and hall rents,
are issues where the Union should
campaign on behalf of the students.
But on other political issues such as
Babar Ahmad and the war in Iraq, I
don’t think it’s the role of the Union
to have a stance, because it would
seem that the Union was dictating
to the students what their opinion
should be. It should be the role of
the Union to ensure that people can
express their views and act within
the law to support those views, such
as through demonstrations.
The current President
claimed to work 100 hours
a week during the autumn
term. How would you manage
the workload?
It’s a good question... I think every-
body at some point will have worked
that amount for their degree, if
you’ve got lots of coursework due in
on one day, or in the last few weeks
before your exams. I’ve worked that
hard some weeks for my degree and
never buckled under the pressure.
There will be weeks when you can
take it slightly easier.
What are your views on hall
rents? Should they be based
on students’ ability to pay?
I can see the logic behind standard-
ising all hall accommodation, but at
the end of the day, there are people
who aren’t able to pay £150 a week,
so there should be cheaper rooms
that cater for what people are able
to pay.
Your manifesto promises to
make the Union “a venue that
caters for everyone”. How
will you achieve that?
At the moment, what hits you when
you walk in is the bar, basically. We
have late licences on Wednesdays
and Fridays, all broadly based on
a European mentality of going out.
But at the moment we have 40%
overseas students, people who come
from a culture that doesn’t involve
going out for a pint, and I think they
should be catered for. I think the
suggestion of having a coffee bar
in place of Da Vinci’s is one of the
greatest suggestions made by the
Union this year – somewhere people
can go where there’s no suggestion
of alcohol consumption around them
and where they can go and sit in the
afternoon.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
I think it’s the kind of person that
I am, I’m a lot different to the
Presidents that we’ve had recently.
Not to say anything bad about them,
but I think I’ll be more approach-
able, and I think people will actu-
ally believe I’m representing their
points of view.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
People should vote for me if they
think I’m the best candidate, and
if they think I’ll be able to do the
things that I promise to do. But the
most important thing is to vote.
