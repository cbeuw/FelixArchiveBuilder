Confectionery sensation:
three Creme Eggs for 90p
www.felixonline.co.uk
By Emily Gwyer
Itis,astonishingly,threeyears
since the invasion of Iraq was
first mooted by Geroge Bush
in the wake of September 11.
In that time there has been
a fury of argument, which, at
times, threatened to drown
out every other discussion in
British politics.
Tony Blair has, somehow,
managed to cling on through-
out the rage, even though a
group of lawyers tried to take
him to court, European lead-
ers snubbed him and he was
ridiculed as a lap dog. And
now, well, it looks like things
are going to get a lot bet-
ter for Mr Blair. Love him
or loathe him, he’s a smooth
political operator, and the
Government may have just
scored one its biggest tri-
umphs: the democratic elec-
tions in Iraq.
It appears the largest Shia
party has won the majority
of the votes, with the current
(interim) Prime Minister’s
party in second place.
And the pro-war lot are
crowing. “A beacon is lit in
Iraq. But not in your names,
Robin (Cook), Douglas (Hurd)
and the BBC,” shouted The
Times, taking the argument
to this conclusion: if you were
against the invasion of Iraq,
against removing Saddam
Hussein, then you are also
against these elections and
the freedom now enjoyed in
Iraq. The paper takes the
success of the elections (with
a turnout beating that of
Britain, by some accounts) as
vindication for supporting the
war: “It is only by securing a
decisive shift towards democ-
racy across the region that
the Middle East’s peoples can
be relieved, and the threat to
the rest of us brought to an
end.”
The Telegraph compared
the violence currently erupt-
ing in Iraq, slightly dubiously
but with great effect, to South
Africa. “Compare yesterday’s
reportswiththosebythesame
commentators during South
Africa’s first democratic elec-
tion. Then, too, there were
many technical problems:
voters who were not properly
registered, voter intimida-
tion, long queues. But these
things were set in their prop-
er context as the backdrop
against which the moving
drama of people casting their
first ballots was being played
out. No-one suggested that
the clashes between IFP and
ANC supporters in Zululand
undermined the whole proc-
ess. No-one argued that the
backlash by a handful of black
homeland chieftains and Boer
irreconcilables made South
Africa unfit for democracy.”
It may be, as David
Aaronovitch, the only pro-
war writer on The Guardian
staff, believes, that people
have got themselves onto a
hook where they are unable
to celebrate the return of
democracy to Iraq because
they are still so furious with
Bush and Blair.
Aaronovitch claims that
“opposition to the actions of
Bush and Blair has become…
an utter failure to identify
with those extraordinarily
brave Iraqis who are fighting
for democracy.” He encour-
ages British liberals to move
on. “Now is all that matters.
Not whether you were for or
against the war, for or against
Blair, for or against Bush. Are
you for or against democracy
in Iraq? The rest is air.”
Since the elections, this has
quieted down slightly. News
of more car bombs has less-
ened the hysteria, and Bush’s
inauguration speech has
overshadowed everything
else. But beware, woolly liber-
al readers: you are now more
unfashionable than ever.
Iraqi democracy
A triumph for Bush and Blair?
Imperial students chosen for
sport scholarship scheme
Five Imperial students have
been selected for the govern-
ment funded Talented Athlete
Scholarship Scheme (TASS).
The programme awards
scholarships and bursaries
to talented athletes who are
committed to combining
sport with their education.
It aims to reduce the drop-
out rate of gifted athletes
from sport, and supports and
develops the talent of today
for sporting success in the
future.
Rhonda Sturley (judo),
Tristan Lane (fencing), Robin
Nicholson, Chris Archer and
Simon Hislop (all rowing) will
all benefit from the scheme.
For further information on
TASS and details on eligibility
to apply, please contact Nick
Gore, the College’s Sports
Development Officer, on
n.gore@ic.ac.uk or 020 7594

Felix can reveal that the
Imperial College Union shop
and newsagent are, once
again, selling three Cadbury’s
Creme Eggs for just 90p.
The shop and the newsa-
gent, located on the Sherfield
Walkway, expect to be inun-
dated by crazed students des-
perate for the fondant-filled
treats over the coming days.
Defying inflation, shop man-
agers have decided not to
raise the price after the eggs
proved so popular last year.
Will Dugdale, assistant
manager of the Union shop
and a former editor of this
newspaper, said: “Following
last year’s debaucherous
egg-related behaviour from
the students of Imperial
College, I’d like to take this
opportunity to deny rumours
that we’ll be hiring Renegade
Security staff as a precaution-
ary measure.”
Phil Stewart, a former
newsagent supervisor, told
Felix: “I do admit I fear the
real possibility of a Great
Creme Egg Rush once word
has got out.”
Creme Eggs were first sold
by Cadbury Brothers in 1923,
but the eggs as we now know
them were not produced until
1971.
Interestingly, the Cadbury
Schweppes website claims
that “the Cadbury Creme
Egg plant at Bournville can
produce more than 1.5 million
eggs per day”. It is unclear
whether the word ‘plant’
refers to a factory or some
sort of magical photosynthet-
ic organism.
Cadbury’s Creme Egg is the
UK’s best selling confection-
ery item between 1 January
and Easter. Over 200 million
of the eggs are sold annually
– that’s three for every UK
resident.
The “how do you eat yours?”
advertising campaign is now
synonymous with the eggs,
which have been promoted
with great effect in recent
years by the likes of George
Dawes and the characters
from Spitting Image. Lots and lots of Cadbury’s Creme Eggs
