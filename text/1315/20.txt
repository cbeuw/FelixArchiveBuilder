I’m told that a good way to
start an article is with a witty
comment or startling revela-
tion. After considering this, I
have come to the conclusion
that I don’t have anything star-
tling to reveal (well, legally
anyway) and that being witty
is difficult when challenged,
as people who know me are
very much aware.
Therefore I will start the
article like this: those who
are disappointed can send a
stamped self-addressed enve-
lope with £10 in used notes
to me and I will send a writ-
ten apology. And with that,
here’s this weeks topic of
minor insanity – the Ultimate
Wheel!
The Ultimate Wheel is the
ideal thing for people who
think unicycling is for wus-
sies. If you can unicycle, the
most obvious thing is surely to
take the seat away for added
difficulty, right? You wouldn’t
think it is possible, but some
sanity-deprived individuals
can actually transport them-
selves on this device, which
basically consists of a wheel
with two pedals and nothing
else. Only the mentally dis-
turbed need apply.
In order to ride this lunatic
contraption, the first step is
to put your feet on it. Our
carefully selected model (no
expense spared) demon-
strates [see picture 1].
The next thing to do is
mount the Wheel properly
[see picture 2]. Thankfully,
the pedals are quite sticky so
your feet don’t fall off, unless
you crash, in which case they
tend to sever your tendons.
Just consider it fair warning.
You can either mount with the
assistance of a wall or lamp-
post, or free mount which is
harder – you just jump on and
pray. See the Big Red Ball
episode for more information
on the importance of prayer.
After that, pedal. Try to
keep the Wheel upright [see
picture 3]. I appreciate that
this is probably obvious,
but the faster you go, the
easier it is to keep going. If
you have done this indoors,
you’re about to find a small
problem with the Ultimate
Wheel...
Changing direction. You’re
probably quite pleased that
you’ve not suffered major
damage by now, but this state
of affairs is about to change
unless you move away from
the looming wall. In order
to achieve this, wrench your
hips in one direction, hard,
and put your weight slightly
over to that side [see picture
4]. Now push your vertebrae
back into place.
Finally, you’ve got to get
off. I recommend falling – it’s
easier and almost a foregone
conclusion after a while.
Alternatively you can step off,
but the net effect is much the
same [see picture 5].
Well, that’s it. If anyone
has an Ultimate Wheel that
they didn’t know how to use,
they do now. If, for whatever
reason, you don’t have one
(and lets face it – why not,
dammit?) you can always use
ours. Mail juggling@ic.ac.uk,
come to juggling on Tuesdays
at 6pm and we’ll let you play
with it, as well as many other
things. Ahem.

(Instru)mental was created
last October with the aim of
giving me an opportunity to
take the music I listen to and
present it to anyone who is
interested. The emphasis is
on the tougher varieties of
dance music, in particular
hard house and hard trance.
The basic structure is an
eclectic first hour, with a
broad spectrum of dance
music, followed by a live mix
in the second hour, where I
pick the latest hard dance and
put it alongside some older
material, all for the listen-
ing pleasure of anyone who
tunes in.
Although the above is a
fairly accurate description
of my show, I think it fails
to capture the real spirit of
IC Radio. I’m certainly not a
professional, and although IC
Radio does produce shows of
a high quality, the emphasis is
much more about having fun
than producing something
groundbreaking.
For most of the shows I do,
I simply arrive with a stack
of vinyl and a rough idea of
the order I want to play it in.
I think this is typical of most
of the specialist music shows
on ICRadio – there is a strong
feeling amongst us that it’s
the music that matters, and
that too much preparation
somehow spoils it all!
Also typical is that I play
what I want to. There are
plenty of opportunities for
people to come in and play
more mainstream music,
or even do news and cur-
rent affairs, but the brilliant
thing about IC Radio (or
indeed any student radio) is
that we are your radio sta-
tion, and part of the reason
we exist is to let students
of all musical tastes share
their passion. The chances
are that at university you will
always find someone whose
musical tastes are similar to
yours, and specialist music
shows are about presenting
that music both to people who
know and love it, and also to
people who might not have
come across it before.
It’s easy to get bored with
the music policy of the Union.
R’n’B and drum and bass are
alright, but the Union really
lacks the variety of specialist
music that student radio can
offer.
As I fade out the latest Short
Circuit promo and switch
back to our sustain service,
I can’t help but wonder why
more people don’t do what I
do. The opportunity to play
the music you love on air is
very rare outside university.
Locking up the studio for the
night, I walk out of Beit Quad
and pass some people leaving
the Union. I can’t help but
think they are missing out.
