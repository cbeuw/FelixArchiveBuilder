SIMON RAWSON
COLIN SMITH
Why are you standing for
President?
Well, I’ve been involved with the stu-
dents’ union for the last four years
now, since I’ve been at Imperial
College, and it’s something I’ve
thoroughly enjoyed being involved
in. I’ve got a lot out of it, and in the
corny sense of the word it’s time to
put something back into it. I also
firmly believe I’ve got something
real to give to the students’ union,
in terms of my leadership, my ideas,
and my passion for the Union.
What’s the single most
important thing a students’
union can do for its
members?
Activities, identities and services
are three core areas, but if I had to
pick one I’d pick representation.
Should Imperial College
Union be campaigning to
free Babar Ahmad?
In my opinion, no. I personally
believe that he should be freed and
I support the campaign, however
I don’t think that’s the role of the
Union. I see ICU fighting directly for
students on issues that affect stu-
dents here and now, and I think it’s
stretching that definition quite far
to say that the Free Babar Ahmad
campaign affects the students right
now.
What are your views on hall
rents?
I feel that it’s important that the
College offers a range of accommo-
dation, and a high standard. Rents
at the moment are getting towards
extortionate levels, and I would like
to see them held for the next few
years. When the new Southside halls
are built in a few years’ time, I do not
want to see rents shoot through the
roof like they have done in Beit.
Should rents be based on
students’ ability to pay?
Should richer students pay
more for the same quality of
accommodation?
No.
You say in your manifesto
that you support moves to
modernise Beit Quad. Which
moves in particular?
As I said, I think the current moves
to modernise the Quad are excel-
lent, and I am fully behind them.
However I wouldn’t let anything go
ahead that would jeopardise club
and society activities. In particular
I’m thinking about the Union gym
and some of the meeting rooms.
In my opinion, the plans for the
gym and some of the meeting rooms
have not been thought through fully,
and we’d be putting ourselves in a
seriously difficult position in terms
of clubs and societies. However I am
fully in favour of modernising the
ground floor. I think the main foyer
is grotesque and needs completely
overhauling and modernising, our
entertainment venues could do with
modernising, and there’s no doubt
that the catering facilities in Da
Vinci’s need to be brought into the
21st century.
You also mention your
“involvement with ICU at
every level”. How would that
make you a good President?
Well initially I got involved in a
handful of clubs and societies in
my first year, as I think most peo-
ple did. I went on to be chairman
of Musical Theatre Society, before
becoming chairman of the Arts and
Entertainments Board this academ-
ic year. I’ve also been involved as
senior part time staff in the ents
department for the past two and a
half years. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed
working for the Union, and I think
that having seen both sides of the
Union does make me a better candi-
date, as I have a realistic impression
of what goes on. Working as a volun-
teer officer you can get a very ide-
alistic viewpoint of what you should
be achieving, but working as staff
you get a much more realistic idea
of how things actually work. I’ve
thoroughly enjoyed being behind the
scenes, not just being a person who
says how they want it to be, but
being a person who actually makes
it happen.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
As I’ve said, I have got a broad level
of experience from different points
of view, the inside and outside, as a
student and a staff member. I don’t
think it’s a fair argument to say
that a newcomer to the post would
take months to get to grips with
it. In actual fact I will say explic-
itly now that I am against two-year
sabbatical positions. Sabbaticals are
there to give the ideas, the repre-
sentation and the leadership, not
to do the day-to-day work. After
people become removed from the
student body, they become removed
from student opinion. I believe that
I offer a realistic outlook for the
Union. I’m talking real things, real
achievements, sensible ideas, not
campaigns to save the world or stop
the war in Iraq.
Why are you standing for
President?
For a lot of reasons really. One of
them is that I’m sick and tired of the
way the Union’s been run over the
last couple of years – basically I don’t
think it’s a representative or demo-
cratic organisation in any sense of
what those words should mean. So
part of why I’m standing is because,
if elected, I would make a number of
changes to make the Union far more
representative of the student body,
such as moving from the enclosed,
bureaucratic Council system to the
General Meeting system where it’s
one student one vote, and any stu-
dent can vote on Union policy.
What’s the single most
important thing a students’
union can do for its
members?
Represent them, that’s the most
important thing. I’m sure everyone’s
got their own idea of how they want
their Union to be, but representa-
tion is the key issue.
Should Imperial College
Union be campaigning to
free Babar Ahmad?
The Union should most definitely
be campaigning for his release. I
believe we should have campaigned
for his release even if he had no
connection with Imperial, but since
he does have that connection it’s
unquestionable. As a Union we can
have a real influence in the cam-
paign as we’re his former College, so
it’s important that we get involved.
What about other political
issues, such as ‘stop George
Bush’ or pulling British troops
out of Iraq?
Obviously it comes down to what
the student body as a whole want,
and that’s part of opening the Union
up to the students. I believe that
the majority of people would want
to take those steps, partly because
they’re enormously important
issues on a global scale and it would
be stupid to ignore them. I think
Imperial is far too isolated and we
need to address these issues. Also I
think it would strengthen the Union
if we did campaign on issues that
people care about, because it would
involve them in the process and give
people more confidence and more
faith in the Union if it’s being seen
to fight on different fronts. Look at
LSE, they’re taking a stance on the
war and they regularly have three
or four hundred people at general
meetings discussing these issues
and others.
Can the Union really make a
difference on those issues,
or would it be better to spend
the time and resources on
clubs and societies?
I don’t think it would detract in any
way from clubs and societies – I
think our Union can do both. Actually
it would help clubs and societies
because we would draw more stu-
dents into meetings to make deci-
sions on clubs and societies and on
other issues.
The current President
claimed to work 100 hours
a week during the autumn
term. How would you manage
the workload?
I think Mustafa complains a lot, but
I do understand it is an extremely
demanding job. I’m very politically
active as a person, I spend most
days, nights and weekends doing
stuff politically as well as doing my
course, so I think that would be good
preparation. I am involved in a lot of
things across the board, and I think
President would be a good step up.
What are your views on hall
rents? Should they be based
on students’ ability to pay?
My stance is that rents should be
based on students’ ability to pay
– richer students should pay more
for their accommodation, subsidis-
ing those who can’t afford it. Within
that, it should be random which hall
you get. I also think that hall rents
shouldn’t be increasing every year. I
understand that College Residences
have to be self-funding by law, so I
think we should be campaigning for
this to change. We know how much
money the College has, so there’s
enough there to make sure that
rents don’t have to increase.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make to
Imperial College Union?
Most people would see the big-
gest change as a drive to General
Meetings, one student one vote,
instead of Council meetings. I think
most students would see that as a
positive change.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
I think there’s a similar thrust to
what the other four candidates
are saying. They want to basically
maintain what’s happening at the
moment and make minor changes,
but I think change is what we need,
to make ICU a fighting students’
union.
