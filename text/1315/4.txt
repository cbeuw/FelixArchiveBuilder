$hell profits rocket
Kabir Merali investigates Shell’s recent record-breaking announcement
On Thursday 3 February,
Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil
company, announced record
profits of £9.3bn. This was not
just a record for the com-
pany, but also a record for any
British business, ever.
The most significant con-
tributor to Shell’s profits
was the continued high oil
price during the last year.
The war in Iraq, problems in
Venezuela and Nigeria, trou-
ble at the Russian oil firm
Yukos and high demand from
China all contributed to the
high price of oil. The OPEC
group of oil producing nations
also reached maximum oil
output rates and so could not
increase supply to reduce
prices. These factors led to
an all time record price of
over $55 a barrel.
When oil prices are high,
Shell and other oil companies
make more money even if they
keep their profit margins the
same. Indeed, this has been a
great year for the energy sec-
tor, with Exxon Mobil making
a record $25.3bn profit and
Chevron Texaco doubling its
forth quarter profits.
Shell’s recent troubles
However, what is surprising
about Shell’s record profit is
that the company has been
through a lot of difficulties
recently. Just under a year
ago, Cairn Energy announced
that it had found major oil
reserves in the Rajasthan
area of India, and the news
of the discovery rocketed
Cairn into the FTSE top 100
companies. This was a major
embarrassment for Shell, as
they had sold the oil field to
Cairn for only $7m. It is now
valued at $500m.
While Cairn was making
huge finds in its oil reserves,
Shell began announcing to
the stock market that it had
overestimated the amount
of oil it thought it had left
under the ground of the fields
it owned. It has now re-evalu-
ated its oil reserves five times
in just over a year, which has
resulted in it losing a third of
its projected total.
This scandal has resulted
in Shell being fined £82.7m
by the US and UK financial
regulators. The scandal also
resulted in the departure of
three top executives and an
end to the company’s historic
dual board system, where it
had one board in the UK and
one in the Netherlands.
Although it announced
record profits, Shell’s share
price fell 1.7% as investors
predicted a tough year ahead
for the company. It only has
nine years’ worth of project-
ed oil reserves left, and only
added the equivalent of ten
weeks’ worth of oil produc-
tion in 2004. This compares
badly with Exxon Mobil, who
have 14 years of oil reserves
left and found enough new oil
last year to make up for what
they sold. Essentially, at this
rate, Exxon Mobil have the
reserves to keep on going, but
Shell may not last ten years.
Windfall tax
Shell’s record profits have
been called “obscene” and
have led to new calls for a
one off ‘windfall tax’, which
could be used to improve
Government spending or to
boost pension funds. This
has happened before, in 1997,
whentheLabourGovernment
taxed privatised utility com-
panies £4.8bn extra to fund
the ‘welfare to work’ scheme.
Although they complained,
the utility companies paid up
in the end. Shell, however, has
threatened to reduce North
Sea Oil production, and thus
cut UK jobs, if it is taxed
further.
Although a tax may look
tempting, we need to remem-
ber that a company exists
to make profits, and to tax
them extra may deter them
from engaging in business
– what’s the point of working
hard to make money if the
Government is just going to
take it from you?
Secondly, this profit is just
a one-off and is not caused by
Shell ripping off its customer,
but rather by high oil prices.
The Government wouldn’t
even think of subsidising
Shell if it were making a loss
because oil prices were low.
If the Government were to
tax Shell, it would be on inter-
national profits, not just those
earned in the UK. This could
be challenged in the courts, or
may lead to retaliatory action
by other nations, which would
be bad for British business.
Environmental concerns
Environmental groups want
to tax Shell for different rea-
sons to consumer groups and
trade unions. Friends of the
Earth (FoE) argue that Shell
only makes so much money
because other people are left
to pick up the cost of its pollu-
tion. The gas burnt when oil
is drilled from Shell’s Nigeria
plant produces more green-
house gases than the whole
of sub-Saharan Africa com-
bined. FoE wants Shell taxed
to help pay for s the envi-
ronmental damage caused by
energy companies.
“If Shell had to pay for the
damage being caused by glo-
bal warming, these figures
would not look so good. Shell
should seek future profit-
ability in clean and sustain-
able energy, not the fossil
fuels that now endanger our
planet,” said FoE.
The Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell announced record profits of £9.3bn last week, mainly due to the high price of oil from refineries like this
Shell’s £9.3bn
profit
● £9.3bn is a record British
profit (at least until Vodafone
releases its figures in April)
● It’s equivalent to £25m a
day or £1m an hour or £295
per second!
● If it was stacked in £50
notes, it would reach twice
the height of Everest and
weigh more than two blue
whales
