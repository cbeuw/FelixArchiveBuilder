How do I vote?
After reading the interviews on the
next few pages, we hope you will be
inspired to log on and cast your vote.
The elections will be taking place
online from 00.01am on Friday 11
February and will close at 11.59pm
on Tuesday 15 February.
To vote, just go to www.union.ic.ac.
uk/vote during this time and use
your Imperial College login to enter
the voting site. If you are a regis-
tered student but do not have an
IC login (for example, because you
are studying a joint course between
Imperial College and another insti-
tution such as the Royal College
of Art), please email elections@ic.
ac.uk to arrange to vote by email.
All Union elections are carried out
by Single Transferable Vote (STV),
a system that has been developed
to give the voter more power than
in the traditional ‘first past the post’
system favoured in UK General
Elections. STV is a form of preferen-
tial voting, which means that instead
of casting a single vote for a single
candidate, a voter can express a list
of preferences. Votes are cast by
putting a ‘1’ in the column next to
the voter’s preferred candidate, a ‘2’
beside their second favourite candi-
date and so on until they no longer
wish to express a preference.
When it comes to counting the
votes, a quota is calculated which
sets the number of votes a candi-
date must attain to be elected. This
is simply the total number of votes
cast, divided by one more than the
number of candidates to be elected,
plus one vote. By following this for-
mula, no more than the required
number of candidates can reach
the quota. First, votes are counted
according to the first preferenc-
es, and any candidates who have
achieved the quota are elected.
To decide which of the remaining
candidates are elected, the votes
are transferred from candidates
who have more than the necessary
number to achieve the quota and
from the candidate with the least
number of votes. This means that
where the first preference of a voter
was not able to be used to elect a
candidate (or not necessary, in the
case of a candidate who has reached
quota), their subsequent preferenc-
es come into play. This process of
transferring votes continues until
the required number of candidates
have attained enough votes to be
elected.
The main benefit of STV is that
it avoids wasting votes in so-called
‘safe seats’, where one candidate
might be streets ahead of the others
– in this case, the second choice can-
didates will make a real difference.
Or, similarly, you may want to back
a candidate who ends up getting
eliminated – your vote would not be
wasted, as your next preference will
be reallocated to a candidate who’s
still in the race. All in all, it empow-
ers the voter.

Candidate interviews
Felix has interviewed all the candidates for the 2005 Imperial College Union sabbatical elections.
The students you elect will take a year out from their degrees to occupy the most senior roles in
your students’ union. Take a look at the Union’s article below for information on how to cast your
vote and how the voting system works, then turn over to find out what the candidates had to say
Re-Open
Nominations
● In each of the five elections, you can vote to
Re-Open Nominations (RON)
● If you don’t think any of the candidates for a
particular post are good enough, vote RON
● If RON wins, there will be a new election for
that post
What’s RON all about then?
RON is Re-Open Nominations. It’s
an option on your online ballot slip.
By voting RON, you’re choosing to
re-open nominations. If RON wins,
we’ll have a new election. Some of
the candidates won’t stand, we’ll
remove the wheat from the chaff,
and better people will stand. By
re-running the election, we have
the added bonus off pissing off our
esteemed President, Mustafa Arif.
Voting RON sends a message to
the candidates that we are no longer
happy to accept mediocre sabbati-
cals; we only want the best.
Is a vote for RON a wasted
vote?
It’s not a waste at all. Not a single
vote in these elections is wasted. By
voting RON, you are sending a mes-
sage to those standing that they’re
not good enough.
Why would voting RON make
the Union better?
The Union is going through a time of
great upheaval. We need sabbaticals
with a clear, powerful vision, with
strength and determination to see
things through.
We need Deputy Presidents
who are capable of supporting the
President in his or her role.
Looking at the Presidential candi-
dates, some of them have a distinct
lack of exp in high-profile roles. And
just because a co-pilot has seen a
pilot fly a plane once, that doesn’t
mean they’re capable of doing
their job. People should vote RON
because we only want the best.
● Felix spoke to Sanjeev Sarda,
RON campaign manager
