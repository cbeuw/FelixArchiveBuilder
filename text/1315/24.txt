ALBUM REVIEWS
A band consisting of only two blokes
and a pink album cover adorned with
their heads and modified phallic-
trunk-noses immediately conjures
up the ‘two puffs and a keyboard’
genre of music we all hoped was
banished to the eighties. Thankfully,
Death From Above 1979 are not
your average two man ensemble but
instead are out to insult, expose and
educate you.
Violent music has been about for
years, well honed in electronica (the
Prodigy’s new album a prime exam-
ple) and metal, but it has never
really been expressed alternatively.
Perhaps indie kids don’t want it, or
perhaps no one can provide it, but
the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the closest
band in sight to mildly assault your
ears.
So are Death From Above the
answer? Yes, not only do they fill the
void, they kick you in the teeth and
are the embodiment of the innova-
tion and class that has been lacking
from today’s new acts. Listening to
the album, I could only be inspired
by the bass lines exceeding the
scope of many modern guitar parts,
whilst Sebastien Grainger provides
not only original drumming but lurid
vocals of women and love. Perhaps
it’s the fact they are ex-convicts who
met in a sleazy Toronto jail, or their
insatiable desires for the opposite
sex, but the energy of their perform-
ance is outstanding, picking up from
where everyone else has left off.
From the start of You’re A Woman,
I’m A Machine, their debut LP
,
Death From Above capture your
attention with the fast paced Turn It
Out, followed by Romantic Rights;
a summary of Grainger’s rampant
libido and his favourite chat-up line
“I know you love me you don’t know
what you like.” Never letting up,
Jesse Keller powers out blistering
bass riffs to put Lemmy to shame.
Thickening the mix with imaginative
synths, the backing complements
the hollow vocals, with tracks such
as Go Home, Get Home, introducing
catchy, melodic undertones whilst
keeping the amps on 11.
I would love to find a bad word to
say about the overuse of distorted
bass or the at times substandard
songwriting, but Death From Above
capture your heart and fly away
with it, leaving a shrivelled shell of
the person you once were. Looking
around, I’m not the only one prais-
ing the band, as it appears they have
instilled fear in fellow musicians and
awed their audiences around the
world. I doubt any significant suc-
cess will come from such an out-
standing and rule-breaking LP
, but
when has anything groundbreaking
been out in the mainstream? Hell,
they don’t even have a guitarist,
and unlike Keane there are no extra
dubs sneaked in in the studio. There
is no doubt this album is paving the
way for something big.
After listening to and reviewing
You’re A Woman, I’m A Machine, I
am left with a sense that this is what
any other new band has to live up to.
Grainger claims “I wanna show you
how I handle business” in the smol-
dering finale to a hectic album (Sexy
Results), and some would say he
already has. I would like to feel that
this is just the beginning; guitarists
need not apply.

I have to admit here – I never really
“got” Electric Six. When they broke
out a few years ago with their hit
Danger! High Voltage!, and the now
omnipresent anthem Gay Bar, the
six-piece from Detroit came bursting
into action and were hailed as one of
the most exciting bands to come
out of the New Rock Revolution™,
despite only really having a few retro
riffs with some catchy tunes.
So it’s with some trepidation that
I approach their follow-up album,
Señor Smoke. Billed as their ‘dark-
er, macabre’ follow up to Fire, I’m
glad someone told me about this, as
I couldn’t hear it at all from listen-
ing to it. Don’t listen to the PR sell
– it’s just more of the same silly
disco tunes, and I literally mean
that. Every tune is pretty much
identical – some electric riffing that
will have ACDC’s lawyers knocking
on the door, followed up by some
of Dick Valentine’s repetitive bari-
tone (“It’s torture, it’s torture, you
scorcher, you scorcher!” he bellows
on Be My Dark Angel), then a dodgy
keyboard solo, then repeat for a bit.
Last time they were perilously close
to becoming a joke band, but they
avoided it – with this album they’ve
become a self parody, which is quite
an achievement considering their
non-serious approach.
General piss-poor writing doesn’t
help either. Every other song has
Dance in the title, which would tire
out even the mighty Bez whilst high
on a bag of sherbet. Lyrically, it’s
a case of throwing together known
words which rhyme (“Can’t sit down
‘cos I’m a dancer / And you know I
have the answer” is a prime exam-
ple in the closer, Future Is In The
Future), which stinks of laziness.
The attempt at satire and humour is
weak as well: the opener Rock And
Roll Evacuation wins the award for
the most hilariously bad political
statement ever, with “Mr President
makes a little money sending people
you don’t even know to Iraq / Mr.
President, I don’t like you, you don’t
know how to RAWK!” Some people
might defend this, citing that it’s
meant to be intentionally camp. I
hope to God that they’re not seri-
ous.
There are some good tunes to be
found here though, which remind
us what made them big in the first
place. Vibrator, which was free
to download, is a decent piece of
new-wave rock, and the cover of
Radio Ga-Ga, despite coming from
one of the world’s most overrated
bands, power chords itself along
well enough. Jimmy Carter stands
out as one of the few tunes where
the dark humour hits home, talk-
ing of “Ronald Regan falling asleep
forever more / Dreaming of nuclear
war...”
It’s these tracks, plus a few other
nice riffs, which saves it from being
a complete disaster. But what Señor
Smoke has shown us is that not
only are Electric Six flogging a dead
horse, they’ve gone and sold it off
for dog food. Outright comedy shtick
can only go so far – it’s time for
Electric Six to move on.

Being one of the most influential
men in music history, Eric Clapton
has spanned the decades, mak-
ing music before you or me were
born. From the early days, with Eric
Clapton and the Powerhouse, play-
ing alongside another legend, Steve
Winwood, Clapton has been in most
of the defining British bands up until
the late 70s, such as Cream (whose
tickets are selling at £800+ for four
special gigs at the Royal Albert
Hall), The Yardbirds and Derek and
the Dominos. All time classics such
as Layla, Sunshine Of Your Love
and Tears In Heaven are proof that
Clapton is nothing short of god; so
who inspired the great man him-
self?
A self-confessed Robert Johnson
freak, Clapton describes on the DVD
for Sessions For Robert J, in search
for rock roots he stumbled across
the skinny delta bluesman, debat-
ably the best blues player before
Hendrix. Robert J Johnson, like the
majority of great musicians, died
before his time, at the rockstar death
age of 27. By then he had amassed a
handful of flakey recordings that fit
on a single CD (often reduced in
record stores to £2.99). The magic of
Johnson is the mesmerizing lyrics
of desperation and a man in search
of happiness to lift him out of a
world of sorrow; Clapton captures
this well in a compilation of his per-
sonal favorite covers found on this
combination.
The CD is a summary of the tracks
seen on the DVD, which are mainly
a mini-documentary of Clapton and
a handful of musicians in his home
studio/barn and several American
locales. Well produced, the covers
give life and expand on Johnson’s
sparse compositions, raising the
profile of a much forgotten genius.
Unfortunately, the close up cuts and
three camera angles of the studio
footage become tedious by the third
track of sixteen, leaving only the
accompanying CD with any longev-
ity.
The problem with this CD/DVD
combination is that it is no differ-
ent to Clapton’s previous outing, Me
& Mr Johnson. Dedicated fans will
lap up the footage, but to most it
appears to be a pointless exploit in
repetition and an attempt to show
off Clapton’s home, musical friends
and various music locations of fame.
This is an easy listening introduc-
tion to Robert Johnson, at twice the
price of the original material; better
examples of Johnson and Clapton
are out there.
