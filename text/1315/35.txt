Something was obviously in
the water over Christmas.
Since the holiday, not one goal
was let in, and seven were
scored. But enough of the fri-
volities, down to the game.
The team were psyched for
this game, mainly because
most of us thought it was LSE.
But Barts turned up, so we
thought: what the hell might
as well give them a game. And
we did. Slick passing flowed
like syrup from the mid-field,
leading to many breaks and
more chances than we’ve had
this season. Unforunately,
we could only convert four
of them with Terry’s poach-
ing skills finely honed. The
first half was essentially one
way traffic, with wave after
wave of attacks foundering
upon either astute defender,
or the inability to hit the
goal. But eventually the pres-
sure had to tell, with a fine
shot from Avi being stolen
by Terry after it had already
beaten the goalkeeper. A rare
Barts attack was broken up
by Ahran (a rock at the back),
whose finely placed through
ball confused and delighted
both sides as it rocketed to
Terry, who calmly fended off
attention and slotted our sec-
ond just before half time.
The second half began in
confusing fashion for Barts.
Our champagne hockey
forced them to conceed a silly
free hit outside the D. Harry
pummelled in the dead ball,
and a gentle flick from King
the skipper took the ball into
the net via the goalie’s hel-
met. Yet another 3rds goal
worthy of the scrap book. The
final goal of the game, how-
ever, was something special:
a tantalising run by HK from
end to end past six players
ended with a generous pass
to Rao, who spanked our
fourth goal.
Rarely has it been seen for
a side to dominate a game
quite so easily, but our cham-
pagne tactics and promises of
Secrets as a reward for good
play means its going down
well for the 3rds.

GKTs. The grudge match.
GKT 2nds. The hard grudge
match. And this time it was
to reach the BUSA play-offs
at the expense of: Yep, you’ve
guessed it, GKT 2nds. Every
single person in our team was
pumped for the match, espe-
cially after last week’s drink-
ing massacre. None more so
than keeper, Rao, who had
decided to add to his injury
tally by fracturing a metacar-
pal on a kebab. This meant
that he was relegated to ref-
eree, and Biscuit became the
man of the moment.
Good job too, frankly, as we
were a bit rubbish. In fact,
for the first half, we played
appallingly. Fortunately, we
dragged our opposition down
to our level, and no-one beats
us in an unfair, home advan-
tage street fight. It was heart-
ening, at least, to know that
even at about 25% of maxi-
mum we were still able to
beat a “better” GKTs side.
The first half was quiet, with
no goals, but some good runs
from both sides. Their front
four were quite adept and
gave our defence a bit of a run
around, but, fortunately, their
midfield had forgotten to turn
up, so there was no setting
up for the killer blow. Instead,
it was route one at various
angles, which, whilst tricky,
had none of the difficulty of a
well worked move. Best of all,
on the few occasions when
it did work, or they actually
passed, Biscuit was there to
assuage all doubt. It wasn’t
all one way stuff in anyway
though, with some cracking
crosses being dummied and
missed all over the shop and
a couple of speculative shots
creeping wide (though, to be
fair their keeper, did do quite
well a few times). The major-
ity of time was spent in their
half, although nothing made it
into the net.
This left us in a quandary at
half time. 0-0. What do we do?
Fortunately, we remembered
some more hockey skills, and
decided winning was the best
option. Again we tried wave
after wave of attack, but this
time the half chances turned
into full chances, with crosses
being met and their goalie
entertained. Finally, our per-
sistence paid off, with Terry
tidying up and slotting the
ball home after a messy goal
mouth fandango. But 1-0.
Never enough in hockey, espe-
cially not in a grudge match.
Back they came with vigour,
and Biscuit was again tested,
but proved worthy. Gradually
we regained authority and
gently ran down the clock
whilst sending out a few break
out counter attacks. The killer
blow was dealt with exactly
one minute left on the clock.
Terry pounced again to guide
the ball in from one cm, fol-
lowing cracking play by King
and Harry in an intense short
corner session. But there
was still time for the most
amazing goal avoidance ever.
Harry, having made a clean
break through, went one on
one with the keeper, and gave
GKTs their only cheer of the
match as the keeper won with
ease. Still, by then it was all
academic.
ICSM Men’s 3rd 5
LSE Men’s 2nd 2
Yet another double-header
grudge match. This time
against LSE. The grudge was
further stoked by last year’s
defeat in snowy Battersea. It
was cold this year too, but
we made the most of a bad
situation by out-classing the
accountants and clerks to
within an inch of their lives.
But in a nice way. Perhaps.
As per current tradition,
we turned up a good half
hour early to warm up the
magical hockey skills that
the thirds currently seem to
possess. As a tribute to past
glories, Frankie “the cock
doc” McDermott returned
from the heady world of
actual work to spearhead the
attacking line-up. We started
in fine fettle, ready to take on
the world and possibly even
LSE. Unfortunately, most of
the game’s events have long
since passed into the steamy
alcoholic memories, but some
things have remained.
Once again, we dominated
the game from start to fin-
ish. From the off, we pillaged
deep into enemy territory,
pinning them back in their
22. Following many different
attacks, with the ball pinging
into the D from all angles
just begging for a tap-in, we
won a couple of short corners,
and Kumar managed to slip
the final one into the back
of the net. Despite a spirited
fight back that lasted all of
about thirty seconds, we ran
straight back into their half
and thought about tighten-
ing our stranglehold with a
second goal. This would have
been a great time to score,
but instead LSE hit back with
a cheeky little strike from a
short corner, which, despite
Rao’s commendable efforts,
resulted in a goal. This lev-
elled things up to 1-1, and a
proper match looked in the
offing. Fortunately, we struck
back decisively soon after
with another bit of Kumar
and Triscott magical inter-
play, leading to another vir-
ginity-shattering goal. 2-1.
Another bit of delivery from
Kumar gave us a half-time
score of 3-1.
A quick team chat and a slap
to wake up goalie Rao set us
upforthesecondhalf.Wewere
ready for a hard retaliation,
and so it proved. They poured
forth onto our defences, look-
ing for a crack or an easy way
through. Fortunately, we held
firm, with the midfield com-
mendably taking the brunt
of it. Eventually, we started
to break out, and forced a
few errors, which eventually
led to a most entertaining
goal. Following an alterca-
tion, their players completely
stopped, despite an amazing
lack of whistle, which allowed
Terry, sharp as a ferret, to
pounce and snaffle up a goal.
It made the score 4-1, but
completely knocked the stuff-
ing out of them, leading to
arguments and general dis-
cord. Another run forward by
Kumar made the score 5-1.
Game over. Yet there was still
time for a shock consolation
goal. A cheap free hit outside
the D in the dying moments
of the game shot through a
pack of players and glanced
off a stick to loop over Rao in
the goal mouth and plop into
the goal. But no-one really
minded as the final whistle
blew, and we had beaten yet
another team.

Another Wednesday, another
BUSA fixture for the firsts.
This time we were at home
against King’s, who are in
about the same position as
we are in the league, having
won and lost to all the same
teams. So, it was set up to be
a close game.
After last week’s “too
close for comfort” win over
Goldsmiths, we knew we
would have to step up the
pressure if we were to secure
the points. Fortunately, we
had actually had a training
session before this match, and
it meant there was a much
more cohesive performance
from the team as a whole.
We got off to a flying start
in the first quarter, breaking
King’scentrefourtimeswhilst
easily holding our own, which
gave us a seven-goal lead by
the break. Even a forced sub-
stitution for a twisted ankle
couldn’t stop us, and our new-
est recruit Sotonye fitted in
straight away, getting some
awesome interceptions within
minutes of coming on court.
King’s tightened their play
in the second quarter, but
we battled on, and our newly
rehearsed tactics (cunningly
devised ten minutes before
the match) paid off and saw us
extend our lead to nine goals.
We kept the defence tight in
the third quarter, whilst con-
tinuing to test theirs. Sam’s
shooting was on top form and
deservedly gave her man of
the match.
And so to the final quarter,
which, up until this game, had
always been our weak point.
But no more. Precision pass-
ing and some great set-plays
combined with sheer deter-
mination meant that King’s
couldn’t make any impact
on our lead. This is our best
scoreline to date, and a very
positive result because we
won all four quarters. Next
week, UCL and LSE.
