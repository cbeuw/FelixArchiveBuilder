Put away your notes. Turn off the
television. Put the textbooks back on
their shelf. Find a copy of Ulysses,
and read it now.
I admit that this is a slightly odd
opening, but I would really recom-
mend reading this book. I can’t real-
ly describe it, I don’t understand it,
it’s just absolutely brilliant.
Most book reviews would cover
the plot. I can do that in a sentence;
Ulysses is about a man, who gets
up, goes to work, wanders around
Dublin, and goes home. That’s it. 24
hours in the life of a certain Leopold
Bloom, on 16 June 1904. Now, you
might think that this makes for
a dull book (especially as this is
spread over 900 pages). However,
Ulysses shouldn’t be read for the
incredible plot; instead, it is the way
it is written that is to be enjoyed.
We are used to reading nov-
els where characters are forced
through a series of quite extraor-
dinary events by god-like authors.
James Joyce, on the other hand,
takes the role of neutral observer
rather than director. The novel is
a verisimilitude, like an intricately
detailed picture taken from nature,
where every brushstroke is loaded
with meaning.
However, there is a definite paral-
lel between the novel and its all-
action predecessor, the Odyssey.
Each chapter of Ulysses is a retell-
ing of an episode of the Odyssey:
the aged professors at the library
are Scylla and Charybdis; the Sirens
become barmaids, and a national-
ist citizen takes the place of the
Cyclops. As well as this, Ulysses is
a physical novel – each chapter has
an associated piece of the anatomy,
and these disparate chapters all
add together to make a function-
ing whole. Also, each chapter is
assigned a colour and a field of
study; although none of this is men-
tioned explicitly, Joyce used these
themes as blueprints for this mas-
sive novel.
Ulysses reflects the fact that Joyce
sees his language as dying out. Not
only is the Irish language giving
way to English, but English is giv-
ing way to ‘electrical English’, the
language of cinema, gramophones
and wireless. And, as such, Ulysses
is a novel to end all novels.
Taking the starting point with
the ancient tradition of poets pass-
ing down their epics, Joyce seems
to move through every conceiv-
able mode of written English.
One chapter is written in Middle
English; another is written as a play.
The most striking chapter is the
Nausicaa chapter, in which Bloom
fantasises about a young girl on the
strand before him. The language
is flowing and poetic, building up
to a climax, when Bloom suddenly
realises that the girl is lame. At this
point, the language collapses into a
mess of the incomplete sentences
and intangible thought processes
that are so common in the rest
of the book. Although this writing
style seems overwhelming, it does
indeed seem that we are reading
the mind of the protagonist. As an
example, consider the lines:
“Perfume of embraces all him
assailed. With hungered flesh
obscurely he mutely craved to
adored”
To most people, it seems that the
words are random. In fact, Joyce
spent an entire day on these two
sentences alone. His English seems
to be teeming with life and beauty,
but only because the words are in
exactly the correct order. At times,
entire sentences are repeated in a
completely different order, to show
the fluidity of language. And the
theme of language is an important
one; Joyce shows how language
defines the way we think, and the
way that we see the world.
The novel was written in the
early part of the 20th century and,
like most creative art from that
period, it deals with encroaching
mechanisation. Bloom sympathis-
es with the machines, thinking in
their terms and giving them words
(“Sllt”, “Gurrhr” and “frseeeeeeee-
fronnnng” are all words assigned
to inanimate objects). Indeed,
Bloom himself seems an automa-
ton at times, following strings of
instructions, with little apparent
motivation. As well as seeming to
be part-machine, he seems to be
part-female as well. One charac-
ter, Stephen Dedalus, sees heav-
en as a place where “everyman is
his own wife”; Bloom takes this to
extremes, both physical (masturba-
tion in the Nausicaa chapter) and
mental. Indeed, reference is made
both to Bloom’s foreskin and (dur-
ing a particularly odd episode) his
vulva, showing his struggle between
masculine and feminine. Perhaps
Joyce saw that man and woman
would eventually become complete-
ly indistinguishable, as humanity
and the inanimate coalesced.
Oneofthemostfascinatingaspects
of Ulysses is the range of references
it makes. As well as Shakespeare
and Chaucer, Joyce includes some
surprising pieces of information,
including astronomical classifica-
tions, historical events, and entire
pieces of legend. A small section
is devoted to an Irish warrior, who
bears images of “Irish heroes and
heroines of antiquity”; these include
Captain Nemo, Alessandro Volta
and (for fans of Saint-Saëns) The
Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo. This dense layering of cross
references means that its hard not
to realise that you recognise some-
thing, although, at the same time, I
was always wondering what I wasn’t
picking up while reading.
I will admit that, for the most
part, I didn’t have a clue what was
going on in Ulysses, but then again,
it isn’t always necessary to under-
stand something to enjoy it. If you
approach it without trying to dissect
it, it’s really enjoyable. The problem
comes later on when you start to
think like bloom yes and stop using
punctuation like the last 60 or so
pages and everything becomes like
one big sentence which is a bril-
liant ending very upbeat yes and the
paragraphs go awol as well but the
word limit approaching how many
words did he say seven hundred yes
too late for that and yes to write yes
and will I stop now Yes
