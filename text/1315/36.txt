RSM 49
Goodenough College 5
By Bebop and
Rocksteady
The miners were faced with
what looked like a fit and
well organised Goodenough
College side, or so it seemed,
when 15 Royal School of
Mines (RSM) warriors turned
up on the pitch in Regents
park from all different direc-
tions... except for Tim Praill,
who spent the night on a park
bench!
With two minutes to go,
acting captain Quincy Allan
(in for the unavailable Eddy
Poulding) warmed up his
team and told volunteer ref-
eree Rich ‘the tallest man
in the word’ Aung to check
the opposition for sharpened
studs, which the Americans
are renowned for. This was
mainly done to buy time to
induce any last minute vomit-
ing from his athletes before
the game started.
The match began with a
very keen Goodenough side
holding the RSM pinned in
their 22, but excellent fringe
work from the likes of Dirty B,
Huy, Big Steve andJoe ‘Albino’
Franklin meant Goodenough
were going nowhere.
Superb phase rugby allowed
the RSM back line to begin
perforating the Americans,
giving fearless vice-captain
Alex O’Rourke the opportu-
nity to miss pass to himself
over winger Kim Grogan and
score the first points.
RSM came under heavy
fire soon afterwards with the
yanks using intrepid moves
such as ‘Iraqi Freedom’ and
‘Infinite Justice’, but once
again the forwards showed
what they were made of and
tactical turnovers came from
the combined efforts of Josh
WrightandBarryStoffell.This
led to another score when fly
half Huy’s magnificent kick
was caught on the try line by
the adhesive hands of Allan.
This opened the flood gates
and Segun Lawson turned
on the pace to break through
their tackles like a German
tankthroughaRussianvillage
(game over for Goodenough!)
Flurries of breaks from
Enrico Ferri (fresh from LA)
and Tim ‘the prowler’ Praill,
in combination with efforts
from the most heroic back
row in the continent, Steven
Hawking and Steff Nubert,
meant lots of tries for the
boys in black.
Five minutes to go, and the
blood-soaked Goodenough
team were so fatigued that
Allan and O’Rourke were
both able to run in their sec-
ond tries, ploughing through
at least eight people each to
take the miners to ultimate
victory.
The RSM is looking like a
freight train going at 200mph,
unlikely to be derailed by any
Cambourne roadblock come
the famous Bottle Match on
26 February.
