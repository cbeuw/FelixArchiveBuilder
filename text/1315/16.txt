ELECTION INTERVIEWS elections@ic.ac.uk
Why are you standing?
I’m standing because of the fact that
I feel it’s a job I can do. I’ve always
been involved in the Union since
I first came to the College back in
October of 2001. This is something
that I feel I’m actually quite good at,
and I can use the abilities that I have
naturally to give something back to
the students.
What’s your opinion on
modernising Beit Quad?
It’s a double-edged sword really.
Coming from the position of Equal
Oppportunities Officer this year, I
can see that there is some moderni-
sation needed in order to comply
with legislation that will be coming
into force towards the end of this
year. Ultimately this Union needs
to give the members what they
want, and if we’re not doing what
the members want, then we should
change what we’re doing. However
if the members are happy with the
building, we should keep it as it is,
but still remembering the new legis-
lation that’s coming in.
How can the Union improve
ents to attract more
students?
Again, it’s a double-edged sword
there. You get many people within
the College who like the ents that
we have. Wednesday nights, for
instance, have always been popular
with sports clubs. Basically it comes
down to finding out what the stu-
dents want, and then doing it so you
actually get feedback.
What do you think they want?
Cheap beer, good music and the
ability to go somewhere with their
friends where they feel safe.
Do you think the Union
wastes money?
Yes.
Where, and how will you stop
it?
For one thing, we do a lot of duplica-
tion. Lots and lots of paperwork gets
duplicated. I know this from being a
club officer, we have to pay for these
things to be printed and processed,
and what’s the point? We can do
all these things on the web, using
the data from College. We might as
well use it to implement a system
whereby club officers can use it in a
way that they want to. We may need
25 different forms, but we don’t need
25 different bits of paper. Also, one of
the things that’s really got my blood
boiling is the fact that about £37,000
currently needs to be accounted for.
That’s a lot of money.
Your manifesto says “more
money for clubs & societies”.
Where will it come from?
We need to prioritise properly. It’s
not that difficult. Money will still
come from the block grant from
College, but also by looking at our
commercial outlets, things like
catering, bars, the shop and the
newsagent. If we give our mem-
bers what they want, they can go in
and buy it, and we can recycle that
money back to them via their club
or society.
What’s the one biggest
change you’d make?
The bureaucracy. I cannot stand it;
it’s overbearing on our officers. I’d
change it by simplifying it, moving
a lot of it online, making things so
much easier and better for the ordi-
nary students on the ground who
get involved in clubs and societies.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
I’ve been involved in this Union for
a fairly long time. I’ve got one of the
most wide-ranging sets of experi-
ences within the Union, not just one
particular pathway. I also have the
track record of doing what needs to
be done. A lot of the positions I’ve
taken, there’s been no-one else to
do them, so I’ve stepped into the
breach, I’ve done the job and then
passed on the mantle to another
student officer who’s taken up the
reins. To be frank, I’ve lost more
elections than I’ve won, but I’m still
here, I’m still fighting, and it doesn’t
faze me any more.
EDWARD PIGGOTT
Why are you standing?
I feel that I’d be good for the job
because I have experience in run-
ning lower level clubs and societies
in the treasury department and also
the chair department. I know how
hard it can be for treasurers to do
their job, and I feel I can do some-
thing to make their jobs easier. Also
because I like this place, I think I’d
be good for the job and good for the
people.
What’s your opinion on
modernising Beit Quad?
We do need to review the amount
of space that different clubs and
societies get for storage purposes
and just for general meetings pur-
poses. Rooms like the Union Dining
Hall are nigh on impossible to book
sometimes. We need more room for
clubs and societies, because there
are something like 250 of them
here. The ideas of having a dedi-
cated Council chamber or a whole
set of new offices are probably not
necessary.
What about having a coffee
bar instead of Da Vinci’s?
Da Vinci’s, from what I know, doesn’t
have a huge amount of trade and
Union ents aren’t that well attended.
That’s something that I’d like to
sort out to begin with. Some people
might think that having three bars
on the same floor is excessive, but
they all serve different purposes,
and you can get a coffee just about
anywhere around here.
How can the Union improve
ents to attract more
students?
Ask the students what they actu-
ally want, using an incentive-based
survey. What I really liked about the
last series of elections was the abil-
ity to donate 25p to a club or society
of the voter’s choice, so if we could
do that with a survey, I’d like to.
Do you think the Union
wastes money?
Any institution wastes money, it’s
just a case of how much. Nothing
is entirely efficient. I personally
haven’t had chance to look into
the Union’s finances in detail,
but I’d like to review the fund-
ing and subsidies given to clubs
and societies. Arts clubs are
horrifically underfunded. I feel
that at an institution where
we don’t have any taught arts,
it’s very important to have some
arts through the Union, so we
can be recognised for having a fan-
tastic Symphony Orchestra and a
good Big Band that enters com-
petitions and wins things. The Big
Band had to put in a contingency
claim for a competition last year,
whereas sports clubs get something
like £1000 for that. I’m not saying we
should cut funding for sports, but
we need more money for arts and
entertainments to level the playing
field.
Your manifesto promises
“more support for clubs and
societies”. How will you
provide that?
I plan to be available five or
six hours a day. I still have the
idealistic view that I can spend
time in my office, so people can
come up and ask me questions and
I can help them. I would plan to
be around almost all the time for
people.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
I feel I have the experience at the
grass roots level. It’s people at that
level who have a thankless task,
a huge workload put on them and
very little training. They need the
help from someone who has done it
and knows about it.
ROBIN AVERY
Why are you standing?
Because it’s my final year and I’ve
been involved with the Union back
and forth every year that I’ve been
here. I’ve had experience on both
sides of finance and services, work-
ing in the bars, participating in
clubs, and I’ve been active amongst
the Union and on the committees
as well.
What qualities can you bring
to the role?
A lot of experience that comes with
participating, being a member of
staff, having good working relation-
ships, and generally having a good
feel for what people want in the
Union.
What’s your opinion on
modernising Beit Quad?
I think it’s a good idea and it’s prob-
ably something that’s been overdue
for a while now. I think it needs a
little more thought, it needs more
consultation of students as to what
they actually want, such as the cof-
fee style venue and non-smoking
areas.
More consultation than the
strategic review, which has
just taken place?
Yes, I think we need more detailed
reviews on specific aspects of it.
Do you have any ideas of your
own about modernising the
Union building?
From what I know, I haven’t heard of
anybody trying to integrate together
bars and catering into one unit. That
could bring a lot of savings in terms
of staff time, and also efficiency and
quality.
Your manifesto says that
Wednesday and Friday nights
at the Union have “fallen
below par”. How would you
improve them?
I think it’s very important that we
try harder to tap student groups
who don’t particularly have any
reason to come into the Union
on Wednesday and Friday nights,
such as most of the overseas
students, the Europeans particular-
ly. The Asians seldom come into the
Union unless it’s one of their own
events. I don’t have any clear cut
idea on how to attract those groups
en masse – I’d have to consult with
the line managers and see what was
possible.
Do you think the Union
wastes money?
I don’t think it wastes money per
se, but I think in some parts it runs
with a certain degree of inefficiency.
By taking closer looks at parts of the
Union, parts of the process, you can
find a lot of inefficiencies and make
the place run smoother and at lower
cost.
Should clubs and societies be
given more money?
In principle yes, because my ori-
gins come from clubs and societies.
But you have to look at the bigger
picture and see where the money’s
going to come from. Obviously we
have the subvention from College
which goes towards pretty much
everything in the Union. In princi-
ple it is definitely a good idea, but
you have to look carefully at where
the losses are going to come from.
If there was no increase from the
College or trust funds or anything,
I’d have to look towards outside
sources of income, possibly blanket
sponsorship, but that’s a long way
into the future.
Why should people vote for
you ahead of the other
candidates?
Because, unlike both the other can-
didates, I have constantly sought
bigger challenges, and succeeded
at what I’ve tried to do. If you look
at Robin, he’s done one club, I’ve
overseen 45. I recently sat on the
finance review group of the Union,
which looked at club and society
budgeting as a whole, and I’m very
keen to continue that, something
which neither Robin nor Edward
have done. I think my experience on
both sides of the bar brings me out
as a stronger candidate on the serv-
ices side than both of them.
