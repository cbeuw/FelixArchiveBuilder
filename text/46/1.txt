Debaters In the U.L. Hut,on 6 t h February
decided that "This House Approves of L e g a l i z e d
Abortion", by 80 votes to 8;
Bart's H o s p i t a l Proposed, and they dropped
a bomb among the sensation and scandal seekers
by d e c l a r i n g t h a t "approves" i s i n the present
tense, and that they, i n common with most doctors,
thoroughly approved of the current l e g a l i t y ef
medically necessary a b o r t i o n . ' There were 700,000
b i r t h s i n England and Wales i n 1950. As one i n
f i v e or s i x pregnancies i s not h e l d , t h i s makes
the number of abortions between 100,000 and 150,000
a year, about 30% of which were b e l i e v e d to be
c r i m i n a l , 90% of these being i n married'women.
The speakers from Bart's condemned a l l those
forms of a b o r t i o n which are at the moment i l l e g a l .
Bedford College Opposed. They had a r r i v e d
prepared f o r a defence of a l l kinds of a b o r t i o n by
the dootors, so n a t u r a l l y enough t h e i r guns were
r a t h e r badly spiked T h e i r min p o i n t s concerned
the lnorease i n promiscuity which l e g a l p r o t e c t i o n
of a b o r t i o n would produce, and a l s o the r e l i g i o u s
( e s p e c i a l l y Roman C a t h o l i c ) harm r e s u l t i n g from
the d e s t r u c t i o n of an unohristened I n f a n t . The
ghost of the o l d " C h i l d or Mother?" controversy
orept i n here, and produced a s e l e c t i o n of the
u s u a l oomments. The Bedford o p p o s i t i o n , a f t e r
s t r e s s i n g the d r e a d f u l consequences of women mak-
ing a h a b i t of l e g a l i z e d a b o r t i o n , shocked the
House by asking f o r s t e r i l i z a t i o n of mental d e f i -
c i e n t s .
Speakers "from tne f l o o r were indignant about
the way i n which the motion had been twisted. It
was pointed out that the current p r a c t i c e of not
prosecuting a doctor who performs a medically neo-- ,
essary a b o r t i o n r e s t s , not on Law, but only on a
precedent. Thus, current Law Is unworkable:
reason enough f o r a l t e r i n g i t .
A more p r a c t i c a l speaker quoted some approxi-
mate s t a t i s t i c s : 1 death i n every 87 abortions i n
U.S.A., where i t i s i l l e g a l ; one i n 10,000 i n
U.S.S.R., where i t i s State sanctioned.

Another speaker asked f o r l e g a l i s a t i o n i n eases
whe*e the p r o d u c t i o n o f the c h i l d would be unhealthy
to s o c i e t y (poverty,disease).but s t r e s s e d t h a t a
l i n e should De arawn somewnere.
Then, a s p i r i t u a l d e s c e n d e d of Shelley stood
up. S h e l l e y s are rare enough, even among students,
i n these days of d i s i l l u s i o n m e n t , and t h i s one
brought a touch of true sense and purpose to a
debate which was being conducted on a s u f f o c a t i n g
moral plane. " S h e l l e y " s a i d : promiscuity i s
h i g h . Very many c h i l d r e n are conceived out of
wedlock. L e g a l i z e d a b o r t i o n would be a smaller
e v i l than the d r e a d f u l convention of enforced mar-
r i a g e i n such oases. Undesired c h i l d r e n should
not be brought i n t o the world; there i s not the
r i g h t atmosphere f o r them. A l s o , i t i s well-known
t h a t a b o r t i o n can be obtained by those who can pay
w e l l . Why not make l t democratic? As f o r the
r e l i g i o u s , they could a c t according to t h e i r p r i n -
c i p l e s without i n t e r f e r i n g with other people.
Another speaker, a woman, suggested that the
problem concerned only women. I t was u n f a i r t h a t
any d e c i s i o n should r e s t with men. The e s t a b l i s h -
ment of l e g a l a b o r t i o n would be a f u r t h e r step
towards the Emancipation of Women.
Summing up, the Bedford oase oould be s t a t e d
in terms of the well-known Commandment: Thou s h a l t
not klj.1. Bart's Bald that current l e g a l p r a c t i c e
was s u f f i c i e n t as a s o l u t i o n of the problem.
Though the speaker was a l l f o r f r e e love ( c h e e r s ) ,
wltn due precautions, he wanted no cnange i n Law.
The Debate was most u n s a t i s f a c t o r y . While
the F l o o r had no doubt about the meaning of the
Motion, the P r o p o s i t i o n refused to accept l t i n the
obvious sense The Motion should have read "This
House would Approve of L e g a l i z e d Abortion", thus
a l l o w i n g the doctors no loopholes to creep Into a
r e s t r i c t e d department about which there i s l i t t l e
controversy i n any case. U.L. ought to frame I t s
Motions a l i t t l e more c a r e f u l l y i n f u t u r e .
CANVEY ISLAND
Imperial College, in common with other Colleges in
U.L., sent working parties to Canvey Island throughout the
period preceding the second expected flooding. The Gliding
Club truck carried the volunteers each day. The work con-
cisted largely of sandbag f i l l i n g , either at the Wall, wit*
mud, or at the Red Cow, with sand. Sandbags also were
.carried to the Wall, as shown in the photograph above. The
imprjessions gained by a FELIX peporter appear on the sport
page.
The thanks of the Editor are due to J.Rotgaus and
J .A.Barlow, who sent» us photographs of Canvey Island.
Also to J.B.Andrews who worked overtime to ensure that
one would be available f o r p r i n t i n g .
R . C . S . C A R N I V A L .
A criticism of an I.C. Carnival must be professional
in _»s acuteness for i t to be of any use at a l l ; > for
Carnivals have reached a peak which i s only insulted by
the usual type of kind, considerate I.C. comment.
The decoration aimed far higher than that usqfi by
Guilds; but i t came off worse. There was an impression
of discontinuity in the Gym - a set of brlllfsnt indivi-
dual pieces, each complete, but leaving soaiething to be
desired in the gaps between. The Green Lady "Amanda" *n
the upper Dining Hall, was frankly pornographic, though
the writer personally was not shocked by i t . An "Evening
Standard" write-up of the occasion described the dancing
as occuring in "sulphur fumes". While this i s not more
accurate than the usual standard of the popular press, th'
atmosphere, reflected in a variety of hideous costumes, w
lertainly reminiscent of Hades.
The Cabaret, an ambitious affair, was largely ruine
by the efforts of some noisy gentlemen, who had drifted •
from the Bar without tickets, and whoso disgusting conduc
