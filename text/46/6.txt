The U.L.H.C.has done very well this season, the re-
sults to date being* Played-~22j won—16) drawn—3$ l o s t ~ 3 .
Goals for 84, agates* 2T.
Good wins have-been against Oxford Univ.,' Richmond,
Spencer, and Blackheath. The Club lost to the Army 2-1.,
Hawks 2-1., and Essex County 3-2.
It i s only since the war, and more especially during
the l a * three or fou years that major clubs consider that
U.L.H.C. i s a 'must' >n their fixture cards.
This season tne OSblicity given the Club has been most
gratifying, and deserving of the Club. It has taken m
e
m
-
bers of the team some time and good groundwork,.both in
Hockey and socially, to obtain this recognition. In hockey
certainly, U.L.H.C. has attained the standard of both Ox-
ford and Cambridge.
I.C. i s indeed unlucky i h that the University draws on
5 players regularly, and occassionally the odd player on J
the eve of the match. J.G.Smith at centre-forward, has
scored an alarming number of goals— alarming, that i s ,
for the opponents. B.D.Smith gives of his best and is much
improved. H.I.Hayes, the Hon. Sec, casually roams, but .
rarely lets anything go by. E.J.Forster i s by far the most
competent member, of the team, affectively sealing off the
left hand aide of the field. He plays for Kent and-the
South of England. Glllete (the Captain), at baox, i s ex-
tremely wild and i s given to 'tioking', but managea some-
how to play hookey! Others who have played are D.J.Power,
W.C.Pike and T.Lam.

U.C. were far too strong for the depleted I.C. team on Wed-
nesday 4th Feb., on the U.C. ground at Shenlay. The home team
split open I.C. defenoe by swinging the ball around, and the
visitors had no answer except the occasional sortie.
In a Stephenson Cup match on Wednesday 11th Feb., RCS
defeated Mines by 8 goals to 2.

During the last few weeks the Rugby Club has had at
number of games cancelled through inclement weather an*the
inability of some opponents to field teams due to f l u ' .
Against Bristol University the l3t XV fought out a
draw although pressing for most of the game. A blustering
cross wind at Harlington was the real v i l l a i n of the piece
and effectively blocked a l l attempts to play open rugby.
On the same day the 2nd XV lost their unbeaten record,
losing to Wasps 'A'. A glance at their points total, how-
ever, Bhows how they have i n general outclassed their
opposition. At the time of writing the 2nd have scored
238 pts. and have had only 28 scored against them.
The *A* XV have recently beaten C.E.M. 1st XV 9-0
and lost heavily to a very strong St. Mary's side.
Kitchener's teem i s rapidly assuming the nature of a
convalescent home with guests from 1st and 2nd XVs trying
out their injuries. It i s understood that applicationa
for permanent positions from a former University Captain
and a County player are being favourably considered. The
latest results are a 19-0 win over, Charlton Park and a
13-5 loss to Richmond Ex. "A".
Whan this article appears I.C. w i l l have played Wye
College in the semi-final of the University Cup and although
i t i s unlikely that the side w i l l be at f u l l strength vic-
tory i s confidently expected.
STICK IN T H E MUD I.C.
No force on earth i s more likely to produce a cramped
style than a journey between Canvey Island and the Union
in the back of the Gliding Club Truck; especially w
S
P

f
t
you have sixteen companions, a l l with soaking trousers and
freezing feet. But every pain has i t s pleasure, as the
Marquis de Sade may have said, and I s t i l l remember with
a feeling of relief how the truck stopped on open ground
after half an hour of organised agonised howling mingled
with a tattoo of fists on the driving cab roof. The next
set of passing headlights silhouetted eight motionless
curbside figures.
On the Island itself, nothing was more memorable than
the morale of the aervioemen who had been on relief work
for a week. The Scots Guards worked side by aide with
tha R.A.F. i n an entente cockle-warming to aea. As a
burly Guardsman said to me "Look at those—R.A.F. They
have a —break for tea every twenty— minutes." A few
minutes later I was drinkine tea out of a billy-can which
had just been washed in a pool of muddy water. The owners
voice hummed confidentially i n my ear, "You can see these
--Guards are no—good. They had to bring the R.A.F. i n . "
It seems quite wonderful how those boys are never
stuck for-a word.
Then there was the Officer. National Service Com-
mission - you know the type - and he wandered along to
•where a heavy lorry was axle deep in mud and had almost
heeled over. "What's the matter? Arent you mobile?
Have you tried pushing?" Five veteran I.C. toughs looked
with mingled feelings at his virgin pink chin, and'tried
again, just to please him, while the Army growled and the
driver grunted.
Beer and skittles are a l l very well; but you cant
have them a l l the time, and the isolated patches of
humour only served to punctuate long stretches of mono-,
tonous drudgery. The notorious East Wall (a name which,
for me, w i l l always smack of Siberia) i s about fifty f e e ^
wide at the base, and five at the top. We were f i l l i n g
the weak parts with sandbags, which we carried on our backs
through mud and'water, and through a l l the other obstacles
which prevented supply lorries from driving right up to the
wall. Some of us were f i l l i n g sandbags with mud, some
with' sand. Whatever we were doing, everything was filthy,
squelchy, muddy. Except the food! How they did i t , I do
not'know; but we had a delicious hot lunch.
Canveyl The very name te.ils off in mournful melan-
choly. Deserted houses, floors covered i n s i l t , ruined
gardens, despair. A barge, two miles inland, straddles
across a fence, where i t f e l l when the floods receded.
Wooden bungalows, hopelessly insubstantial things, turned
completely upside down.
