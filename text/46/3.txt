Our General Studies Survey has brought a c l e a r reply
frora the Union. The experiment has, succeeded. I t i s now
an i n d i s p e n s i b l e feature i n the education of the College.
A l l power to the elbows of those who run i t !
A correspondent asks f o r "a newspaper worthy of
Imperial College . . . decently p r i n t e d on good quality
paper."
I t should be r e a l i s e d t h a t , up to now, FELIX has
paid h i s own way, with the a i d of an occasional dance.
This i s , we b e l i e v e , a record unique among the London
University newspapers, except f o r a few small, duplicated
ones with c i r c u l a t i o n s a tenth of ours. I f we graduate I
to newsprint and type, the b i l l would have to be paid by
the Union funds a v a i l a b l e for other uses
.... The abominable conduct of c e r t a i n well-known gentlemen
during the Carnival Cabaret i s deplored by FELIX. I t i s
widely r e a l i z e d that a tremendous amount of work goes into
the planning and production of a C a r n i v a l . But those l o u t s
seemed to be unaware of t h i s . They i n f l i c t e d t h e i r coarse
and s o t t i s h habits on a crowd of r e v e l l e r s who were w a i t i n g
to hear, not the spontaneous s e n i l i t y of these brutes, but
the c a r e f u l l y prepared entertainneni provided by more t a s t e
f u l a r t i s t s on the stage. The moral, R.C.S., i s to have
chuckers-out.
In d i r e c t contrast, the e x p l o i t s of the Union at
3anvey Island must have earned us a good name. V

t h a t , p r i o r to the students going to Cenvey, there had been
t a l k about the "blackleggers" who are always ready to help
out during a s t r i k e . This impression of students, common
enough outside, must surely ho.ve been eradicated ncu The
troops also ware glad to have us there, though they put i t
more b l u n t l y , though obliquely ( i . e . they refrained from
c a l l i n g u s — t o our faces Those of I.C. who vent dovai
more than once deserve a medal.
Mobody has yet come forward to t e l l us how i t came
about that I.C. was l i b e l l e d i n the f i l m "Lost Hours". Ha
our outcry been conveniently ignored by the person respon-
sible?
There are s t i l l plenty of vacancies for roporters
and w r i t e r s on the s t a f f of FELIX. Future coverage w i l l
involve accounts of the Duke's v i s i t , which we are anxious
to describe accurately. We also require people to s e l l

The Education and T r a i n i n g of ah Engineer
On Thursday January 20th B r i g . A.C. Hughes C.B.E.,
M.I.C.E., the Chief Surveyor f o r the County of Hampshire,
v i s i t e d Guilds and gave a l e c t u r e e n t i t l e d "The Education
and T r a i n i n g of an Engineer" to the Engineering Society.
As B r i g . Hughes i s also a member of the Council of
the U n i v e r s i t y of Southampton, he was i n close touch with
the problem and gave a very i n t e r e s t i n g and provoking
l e c t u r e .
He f e l t that most U n i v e r s i t i e s spent too much time
on subjects which could be l e f t out of the syllabus.
Given a sound mathematical education, the engineer could
learn about these as he required them. The speaker
stressed the importance of engineering reports and said
t h a t f a r too few graduates were capable of w r i t i n g a clear
and l u c i d report.
B r i g . Hughes believed that i n s u f f i c i e n t guidance
was given to the student by the s t a f f to help him select
the branch of engineering f o r which he was most f i t .
Also he deplored the ignorance of most members of a college
s t a f f of the requirements of the n r j o r engineering I n s t i -
t u t i o n s , with the result that the student was ill-equipped
for membership.
He considered that p e r s o n a l i t y was nore important
than anything else when applying for a j o b , and that i n
the f i r s t few years, the young engineer should hold several
jobs i n order that he should obtain a wide experience.

A very long lane with remarkable few turnings i s the

. I t can be the d r e a r i e s t of trudges at 5.15 on a winter's
evening, or l i k e one of those nightmare tunnels you have to
run, run, run f o r ever along i n an A l i c e ' s 'Wonderland or
Dr. C a l i g a r i ' s Fantasie welt at 9.57 on a winter's morning.
I t i s conventional i n these semi-documentary features to
give masses of Fax and Figures. But you won't want to hear
how long i t i s , or how many of those bleak, brown veined
r h i t e t i l e s i t has; i f you have any i n t e r e s t i n these, you
should t r y counting sometime. I t w i l l r e l i e v e the oppres-
sive monotony. But I must say here that i t take s 3 minutes
42 seconds to walk from the Post O f f i c e to the Gents at South
Ken., and 3 minutes 56 seconds to walk from the Gents t o the
Post O f f i c e . The discrepancy i s , of course, due to the
r o t a t i o n and the e l l i p t i c i t y , of the earth.

i s at present engaged on research into the past
h i s t o r y of the tunnel, and Security p r o h i b i t s more than a
h i n t that there was once more to i t than now meets the eye.
However, enigmas of the tunnel are l e g i o n . I often ponder
on the reason f o r changing from a c i r c u l a r sectioned roof to
a square tunnel. Which leads us t o consider the square
tunnel - these l i t t l e bro-.vn p r i n t e d numbers by each of the
i r o n arches. Why are they there at a l l ? I s i t j u s t e v i -
dence of C i v i l Service minds vdth t h e i r inborn tendency f o r
cataloguing? (The mind which w i l l i m p a r t i a l l y stamp "plant
number A12739" on a five s h i l l i n g box of weights and "plant
number A1SJ74C" on an electron microscope.) I think t h a t
somewhere i n London transport archives there i s a t a b l e
something l i k e t h i s .
