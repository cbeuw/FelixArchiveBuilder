The Editor, "Felix"
Sir,
I had always imagined until recently that "Felix"
was a progressive journal. It seoms I am wrong, for
aurely i t i s retrogression when editorial correspondence
i s written on marble slabs, when there i s an adequate
supply of paper.
Yours etc-

Dear Sir,
This evening I happened to be passing the Union
and dropped i n to see the decorations for the R.C.S.
Carnival "Nightmare". I would not have said my
friends consider me particularly Victorian i n outlook,
but I must eonfess to being unpleasantly surprised
ofcen I saw some of the pictures adorning the walls of
the gym. It occurred to me that the theme 'Sex' would
have been more appropriate.
I do not think that inviting visitors to view such
a sordid exhibition gives a very good impression of the
moral tone of the college responsible.
I tun prepared to admit that a lot of the ideas were
very good and i f soma one had known where to draw the line
I think the decorations would have been excellent.
In future, i f Colleges are going to choose difficult
themes for their carnivals, and in particular themes open
to abuse i n the manner I have just deplored, I would suggest
that the Union Committee appointed a few responsible persons
to act as censors In order that the good name of the collage
•hall not Toe tarnished by a few irresponsible artists.
I am not alone i n thia opinion as I have heard i t also
expressed by membera of the R.C.S.
Tours faithfully,
Gungha Din
Dear S i r ,
In view of the proposed altaagas i n the structure
of the Union I would like to 'propose that "Queenie's"
dining h a l l be seriously considered aa an alternative to
the gymnasium for Saturday night hops. Tha facilities
already provided are excellent and a temporary bar could
toe erected i n tha lounge below.
Yours ate.

Sir,
I noticed i n a reoent issue of Felix an advertise-
ment concerning a Prixe Essay Competition. This
advertisement was well printed and easy to read despite the
small site of the printing. In contrast, the rest of tha
paper was badly printed i n various sizes and shades of
type. In fact, the whole paper looked like three Tutorial
sheets fastened together by someone who .hadn't the remotest
idea of how to use a stapling, machine.
So I ask, why cannot a newspaper worthy of Imperial
College be produced - a newspaper decently printed on good
quality paper. Perhaps i f FelixIrere properly produced,
there would be lass unsold copies than there usually are.
Yours faithfully,
A.H.C. Fraser

Dear S i r ,
London University i s unique (at least i n thesUJa*
and, I believe, i n Europe) i n awarding external degrees.
This practice necessitates the setting out of a very
precise inflexible ayxlabus to ensure impartiality; between
widely dispersed candidates mostly .studying under the
guidance of teachers whose only contact with the Uni-
versity i s by correspondence. Such i s an essential
feature of a system which expects a l l candidates to ait
a common examination.
A rigid syllabus i s a serious handicap to a good
teacher and a constant souroe of worry to the eoneeien-
tioua. Adherence to a strictly prescribed programme
results i n stereotyped lessons i n which personal enthu-
siasm and "feeling" for the subject are often lacking-
It accounts for those types of text-books which appear
to be nothing more than suitably expanded copies of the
syllabus and give one the impression that herein lies
the sum total of knowledge of the subject. Such books,
once memorised, guarantee a fairly good pass i n the appro-
priate London examination. Thus, memory becomes a sub-
stitute for understanding, a fact well-known to tha
correspondence colleges.
The examiner i s similarly hampered by thia need for
uniformity, and unimaginative questions result which
reappear, with alight modifications, from year to year -
a boon to desperate candidates but not really i n the tine
spirit of scholarship. Apart from a l l else, tha syllabus
i s always out of date. ,
Despite this evil, the external degree i s an excellent
institution. It offera tha opportunity of an important
qualification to many who oould never afford tha necessary
years of full-time study. To offset the weakness i n their
teaching and examination, external studanta are usually
employed in the practice of their field of study and the
alover rata of learning may leave a deeper impression upon
them.
To have any value i n i t a present form, tha external
degree must be equivalent to i t s internal counterpart.
Thia fact, together with the need to correlate the numer-
ous small colleges which comprise London university, leada
to a similar cramping of internal teaching by the dominat-
ing syllabus. The larger oollegea are freer inasmuch as
they may set their own examinations but, since they belong
to the same degree awarding body, they oannot aacajpa the
influence of thia need for uniformity.
The reoent announcement concerning the proposed ex-
pansion of thia college affords an opportunity to press for
indepandanoe. Imperial College i s large enough and suf-
ficiently well established to stand alone. A Teohnologioal
University of South Kensington, awarding i t a own degrees and
with a character of i t s own would attraot more academic
individualists. The staff should be encouraged to teach
and examine i n their own way - properly supervised by the
responsible Professor and with atandarda safeguarded by an
external examiner.
In thia way students would add to their technical know-
ledge the valuable impression obtained by contact with per-
aonalitlea - essential feature of any University training.
Yours faithfully,
Dear S i r ,
