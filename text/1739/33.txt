The Devastating Australian Fires
O
v e r
63,000 square
kilometres of
bush, forests
and parks have been burnt
down, and at least 24
people have been killed
so far in the devastating
bushfires of Australia. As
of now, over 2000 houses
have been destroyed in
Australia’s months-long
bushfire crisis and power
was lost in multiple areas
as fires engulfed trans-
mission lines. Recently,
the fires have been tamed
slightly by some rains
which brought relief
during this period of
drought,buttheconditions
are said to be worsening
which will threaten to
intensify blazes and allow
the fires to continue for
months.
It is estimated that over
a billion animals have died
in the wildfires. Many
images of koalas hurt by
the fire have appeared
in the media, and there
is the extreme concern
that koalas may become
functionally extinct.
Recently there was also
the announcement that
there will be the culling of
10,000 camels who will
be killed by shooters from
helicopters, as the camels
are perceived to threaten
water resources in south
Australia.
The catastrophic fires
are the result of a combi-
nation of weather factors
including the extreme
heat, prolonged drought

“The prime

and strong winds. People
have also played a big
role, with 24 charged for
bushfire-related offences,
and a further 53 people
were arrested for failing
to comply with state-im-
posed fire bans.
The response of the
government has been
hugely unproportionate
and considered by many
to be inappropriate.
Firstly, the prime minister
Scott Morrison was found
to be taking a holiday in
Hawaii during the bushfire
crisis; this along with the
attempt to cover up the
holiday, spiralled into a
PR disaster with the satir-
ical #Hawaii and #how-
goodishawaii trending on
twitter, followed by more
aggressive hashtags of
#Wherethebloodyhellar-
eyou and #wheresScotty.
Furthermore, the prime
minister has been criti-
cized for the compulsory
callout of 3,000 army re-
servists without consult-
ing the rural fire service
commissioner or commu-
nicating with the defence
force personnel working
from the state control
centre. There are an esti-
mated 3,600 firefighters
combatting fires across
New South Wales.
Among the chaos,
instead of tackling the
issue at hand and review-
ing policies on climate
change, the liberal party
has taken the bushfires
as a press and publicity
opportunity. The prime
minister tweeted a 50
second video promoting
the liberal party, and
pretending that they are
dealing with the issue
with great care, which
faced huge backlash. The
video was basically an
advert for the political
party and contained lots of
“Australia has
previously
faced huge
amounts of
criticism for
their climate
policies”
misleading information.
To add insult to injury,
as the fires escalate, the
prime minister continues
to defend Australia’s
current climate policies,
reliance on the coal
industry and emissions
targets. Scott Morrison
continues to attempt to
distance the fires from
climate change and has
faced widespread criti-
cism for doing so.
Australia has previous-
ly faced huge amounts of
criticism for their climate
policies. A huge contro-
versy arose when they
were accused of using an
accounting loophole to
meet emissions target for
the UN instead of actually
cutting down emissions.
Data indicates that
Australia is indeed getting
hotter, as the all-time
temperature record was
broken twice in December
with 40.9C recorded on
17 December, and 41.9C
a day later, beating the
record 40.3C from 2013.
We can only hope
the government will
strengthen their response
to the fires, so that it can
be contained as soon as
possible, and further dev-
astation can be prevented.
A sad reality is that as
climate change continues
to be denied and not taken
seriously by politicians;
even when the catastroph-
ic consequences have
already taken place, profit
still remains the priority.
