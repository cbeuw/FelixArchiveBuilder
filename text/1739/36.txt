Mozzarella ‘Sticks’ - Here’s how to get your ﬁx now
that you can’t get them at the FiveSixEight

FiveSixEight’s
recent decision to
remove mozzarel-
la sticks from their menu,
I have been left feeling
wronged and desperately
craving the breadcrumb
covered cheesy delight.
Instead of staging a
campus wide protest as
I had initially intended,
I decided to take a level
headed approach and try
making them myself.
Prior to this I was
vaguely aware of how to
make mozzarella sticks
but watched a couple of
YouTube videos to con-
solidate it. All it required
was a square block of
mozzarella cheese and a
production line of ﬂour,
eggs and breadcrumbs.
Sounded simple enough
until I realised I had never
seen a square block of
mozzarella cheese, nor
was I aware that they even
existed.
Nonetheless, all the
youtubers had them and
so I decided to ignore that
thought and put it down to
me never having had the
need for it before. This
was quickly tarnished
when I roamed the cheese
aisles of Asda, Sainsburys
and Tescos only to ﬁnd
the shelves stacked with
endless variations of
cheddar cheese and not
a single block of square
mozzarella. I had no
choice but to settle for
the next best thing I could
ﬁnd which was a cylin-
drical mozzarella block.
Due to this I was unable
to make actual mozzarella
sticks so I opted for more
mozzarella discs.
I ﬁrst began by cutting
the mozzarella into circles
roughly half a centimeter
thick. I then set up the
production line; placing
the ﬂour, mixed eggs and
breadcrumbs into separate
bowls. The mozzarella
then needs to be coated
in ﬂour, then eggs and
lastly the breadcrumbs.
To ensure everything is
fully coated it’s best to
re-coat it in the eggs then
the breadcrumbs again
to make a double bread-
crumb layer. This process
gets very sticky and very
messy very quickly; to
minimize this you can try
using one hand for the wet
ingredients and another
for the dry. Once ﬁnished
place them on a separate
plate.
The recipes that I
looked at suggested
refrigerating/freezing the
mozzarella sticks for a
few hours before frying.
However, I do not have
that level of patience so I
“I have been
left feeling
wronged and
desperately
craving the
breadcrumb
covered cheesy
delight”
“I knew that
nothing would
measure up to
the mozzarella
sticks from
FiveSixEight”
fried them straight away
Nothing went horribly
wrong so I assume it isn’t
a crucial step in making
mozzarella sticks. To fry
the mozzarella discs, you
need roughly enough oil
to drown a baby shark
(or enough to allow them
to ﬂoat). Heat up the oil
on a medium low heat
and make sure to wait
until it is fully hot before
adding in the discs. It’s
wise to use one of the
less good-looking discs
as a tester to check if the
oil was ready. Once the
oil is heated, fry the discs
in batches of 4 or 5; you
don’t want to overload
the pan as it will lower
the temperature of the
oil jeopardizing that all
important crispy coating.
The mozzarella discs are
ready when the cheese
starts bursting out, when
this happens transfer them
onto a lined plate to soak
up the excess oils.
I decided to make
some sweet chili sauce
to go with it which, if
you haven’t made before
I fully recommend. It’s
really simple to make
and just requires putting
chilies, sugar, water and
vinegar in a pan and
leaving it to boil for a few
minutes.
To help me decide if
my homemade mozzarella
discs measured up to the
ones from FiveSixEight, I
wrote up a pros and cons
list.
Pros:
The mozzarella discs
still had that typical crispy
crusts reminiscent of
the mozzarella sticks at
FiveSixEight as well as
the classic cheese pull.
Making them yourself
is also much better value
for money. In total I spent
around £5 on 2 packets
of mozzarella and bread-
crumbs, I didn’t need to
buy the eggs or ﬂour as I
already had them at home.
This is just a little over the
price of mozzarella sticks
at restaurants and you get
considerably more for
your money.
Cons:
The mozzarella itself
did not taste the same as
the ones from restaurants.
I found it to be a lot more
bland and rubbery. This
might be because of the
brand I used or it may
be that commercialized
mozzarella sticks use an
adapted version of moz-
zarella that’s not what you
ﬁnd at the supermarket. I
just personally didn’t like
the ﬂavour of fresh moz-
zarella, especially when
compared to the ones
from FiveSixEight.
Another issue I had is
that I found it a bit un-
nerving seeing all the oil
needed to make the moz-
zarella discs. It’s one thing
being told that something
is unhealthy and another
to witness it for yourself.
Making them from scratch
means can’t turn a blind
eye to how bad it is for
your health. There is the
option of baking them but
it may mean compromis-
ing on the crispy textured
coating.
All in all, the moz-
zarella discs were good
but they just weren’t as
good as the ones from
FiveSixEight. However,
I wouldn’t be opposed to
making them with a differ-
ent type of cheese as the
only real issue was that I
didn’t like the taste of the
mozzarella. However, if
I’m completely honest, I
knew that nothing I made
would measure up to the
mozzarella sticks from
FiveSixEight; I was just
looking for something to
ﬁll the mozzarella shaped
hole in my heart.
