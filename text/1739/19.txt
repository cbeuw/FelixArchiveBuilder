H
ere at Felix, we
take what we
do very seri-
ously because
we believe our writing is
a chance to turn a mirror
to the world we live in and
give us a moment to reflect
on the the part we play.
Sometimes, that reflection
is ugly (see Politics or the
Comments section) and
sometimes it is breathtak-
ingly beautiful (see this
week’s centrefold). But
here at Fashion, we prefer
to use these reflections
to fix our hair or make
sure our tie is suitably
asymmetric (sprezzatura
is an artform). However,
in the spirit of Felix and
the search for meaning,
we turn our full-length
changing-room mirror to
you guys. Take a good
hard look and see if it’s
your likeness we conjure!

We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for fashion writers, photographers, and illustrators to join our team.
No experience needed – your passion will do! If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
and dickies. He hasn’t
bought anything new
himself in years and as a
result smells somewhat
funky, “Like a vintage
store” you say to be polite.
Ben’s style icon is un-
t-shirts, Adidas Superstars
and Vans Authentic.
Looking at him is like
looking back in time... at
your dad. “Timeless!” you
suggest, still trying to be
polite.
Where to shop:
Vintage Stores in Shored-
itch, Kensington Charity
shops, Depop, ASOS
Marketplace,
Canada Goose Flock
The gaggle don their
jackets the moment the
temperature drops below
double figures (Celsius,
not Kelvin).
Definitely not vegan,
they unzip to reveal the
Emperor’s New Clothes
underneath.
The gaggle are protec-
tive of their territory and
possession, deploying a
series of abrasive honks
that sound a lot like “Trust
fund baby” if you get too
close. They are probably
the ones reserving a
computer in the library
with a pencil case and a
box of tic-tacs
Fun fact: a gaggle of
geese in flight are called a
wedge.
Where to shop:
Canada Goose, Harrods
2000s Tina
Tina’s committed to
bringing back the 2000s
whether it’s a good idea or
not (it’s not).
Flared trousers, crop
tops, puffer jackets and
bootleg Chanel are all
staples of the daily look.
They may think fondly of
those as simpler times and
maybe they were, but no
amount of rose-tinting can
excuse fishnet crop-tops
or the sheer amount of
denim.
“...key items
include Levi
501’s, Ralph
Lauren shirts
two sizes too
big, his dad’s
old vintage
tour t-shirts,
Adidas
superstars
and Vans
Authentic.”
Style icons include
Paris Hilton (when she
was relevant... which
was when exactly?) and
Britney Spears (pre-melt-
down version) with soft
goth elements mixed in.
Unfortunately, the
cyclical nature of fashion
is bringing some 2000s
terrors back to the present
so we might be facing a
glitter hair-clip resurgence
any day now.
Where to shop:
Depop, Juicy Couture,
OMighty, Lazy Oaf,
Claire’s
doubtedly Mac Demarco,
but he’ll probably insist
you’ve never heard of him.
Over key items include
Levi 501’s, Ralph Lauren
shirts two sizes too big,
his dad’s old vintage tour
“... a series of
abrasive honks
that sound a
lot like“Trust
fund baby”...”
definitely sweaty and
definitely richer than
you,.the gaggle know that
other layers don’t matter
because they’ve got their
coyote-fur-lined jackets.
Don’t be surprised if
