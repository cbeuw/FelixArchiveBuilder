Meghan Markle: Britain’s racism wouldn’t
let her sparkle!
Eamon Farhat writes about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s decision to withdraw from
frontline Royal duties
COMMENT

A
shock statement
released by
the Duke and
Duchess of
Sussex has outlined plans
for them to step back as
senior royals. No matter
what side of this dire
argument you are on, one
thing is clear: this week
has seen unprecedented
events take place in the
royal family. There has
not been this much drama
since Prince Paedophile
insisted to Emily Matilis
that he wanted to be
known as Prince Pizza
Express instead. I do
not have a huge interest
in the Royals but when
Meghan Markle, a strong,
independent, self-made,
African American actress
first entered the Royal
family, an institution
whose history is steeped
in a less than favourable
view of people of colour,
I was slightly perplexed.
I remember thinking that
it was the most ambitious
crossover since Harry’s
foray with the Nazi strip-
ping brigade.
All jokes aside, Meghan
Markle gave such hope
to me and other people
of colour in the UK and
across the world. She had
the power to give astro-
nomical visibility to the
problems faced and break
people’s pre-conceived
ideas of what the western
elites should look and
act like. Unfortunately,
Meghan Markle coming
into one of Britain’s oldest
institutions exposed an
even older institution still
present in 21st
century
Britain: racism.
Her first appearance in
British press - when the
news of Harry and her
relationship was broken -
as being “(almost) straight
outta Compton” started
painting her as an exotic
outsider. An immediate
verdict was not made
straight away by the press
and the couple enjoyed a
brief honeymoon period,
until suddenly, the mood
changed. Increasingly the
press did not see her as
being compatible with the
British Monarchy.
It is sometimes hard for
people to understand how
the criticism of Meghan
has been racist. Many see
her as a public figure who
is being scrutinised like
any other. When she took
private jets while preach-
ing about the climate
crisis, she was bashed
for being a hypocrite.
This seems fair but when
you read through other
criticisms that the same
people have of her, things
do not seem as rational
and a more racialised
narrative emerges.
When she ate avocados
for example, she was
accused of causing mass
murder. When she held
a beautiful bouquet at
her wedding, the press
insisted she was causing
grave danger to Princess
Charlotte. And of course,
her charity work with a
Muslim Heritage Centre
was linked to terrorism.
These sorts of criticisms
are extremely unfair
and are reported on with
inflammatory comments.
Unlike Kate Middleton,
the perfect English rose,
the British press believes
that Meghan does not
know her place and must
conform. Even small
attempts at deviating from
the rule book have been
met with a barrage of crit-
icism steeped in racism.
With the recent decision
from Harry and Meghan
to step back from their
roles as senior royals,
is the insidious feeling
that others are holding
you to a different standard
because of what they see.
Meghan’s fall from grace
in the eyes of the British
media has shown that even
if you have a successful
career, marry a prince,
and literally become a
princess with the best in-
tentions in the world, your
race will always be what
people see and judge you
Meghan Markle in happier times. Probably // Wikimedia
“Meghan gave
hope to people
of colour in the
UK, and this
recent decision
might be very
saddening for
some ”
this whole debate about
racism, which is usually
swept under a massive
Union jack carpet, has
come out into the open.
The hardest thing about
explaining how all of this
is steeped in racism is the
white privilege it takes to
even ask that question.
When someone says
“give me an example”
it’s insulting. As a person
of colour, I know exactly
what racism feels like,
but it is not my duty to
educate the very white
people who perpetrate it.
Racism is not just being
called names and slurs or
being checked at airport
security. Racism for me
on first.
Meghan gave hope
for people of colour in
the UK, and this recent
decision might be sadden-
ing for some, but I know
that the lovely couple will
go on to great things and
fight for the very issues
that pushed them away. I
wish them luck and praise
their brave decision and
hope that we reflect on the
societal changes needed
for this type of thing to
never have to happen
again.
