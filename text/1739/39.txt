P
oliticians and
parents alike
were gripped by
terror by reports
that last years final year
students had performed
better than the year be-
fore. There are worries
that British universities
are following the exam-
ple of Venezuela where
students had to collect
their diplomas with
wheelbarrows.
Parents of current stu-
dents have written a letter
to the Prime Minister
to demand that he does
‘something about this’.
Many have looked back
nostalgically at their own
university days and asked
why things have changed.
“Back then you got one
degree and were happy
with it.”
International markets
have responded badly
with the exchange rate
for British to European
degrees reaching an all
time low with 10 British
diplomas now being
equivalent to a single
European equivalent.
Boris Johnson has re-
sponded to this crisis with
the creation of the Grade
Institue of Britain that has
the instruction to maintain
a 2% inflation rate written
into its constitution. The
Institute has already run
into difficulties as its
preferred methods of
distributing ketamine,
condoms and vats of curry
sauce to students in order
to dissuade them from
working so hard have
failed to come to fruit.
Governor of the Institute,
Sexy Canadian DILF
Cark Marney, has already
issued a warning for the
next quarter with grade in-
flation expected to exceed
even the most pessimistic
predictions.
Analysts have reported
that the Institute will have
to change its attitude if it
wants to appeal to a new
generation of students.

give a student a Pink Floyd
