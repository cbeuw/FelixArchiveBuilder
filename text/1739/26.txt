Love Techno, Hate London
Q
ueue. It’s mid-
night, in East
London during
Autumn. As
always, you’re waiting in
the cold. The fear of peak-
ing whilst in the queue
is daunting. And you
still need to contest with
all the people “finding
their friends”. But slight
annoyance dissolves into
ecstasy as the bouncer
pats you down and gruffly
says “next”, and like that
you’re in. But then there’s
still the obligatory need to
use the toilet and then the
scamper to the cloakroom
before you finally enter
the main room.
Noise. Waves of pul-
sating bass and hypnotic
synths fill your head and
reverberate through your
body. Your bones rattle.
Your feet buzz. Your mind
dances. You quickly find
your rhythm, accompa-
nied by you, yourself, and
the music. Your friends
are beside you forming
the huddle that would
last the entire night. Your
breath catches in your
throat and your pupils
dilate; excitement takes
hold. You begin bobbing
your head backwards
and forwards, rotating
your hips, swinging your
shoulders. Starting slowly
and gradually building
until you’ve locked into
sync with the tempo of
the music. The crowd per-
fectly mirror the emotions
bubbling within you.
Release. It’s 1am. You
look around the room,
light is absorbed by the
dark interior. Occasion-
ally, the whirling light
illuminates a stranger’s
face. For the briefest
moment, your eyes make
contact. From that one
look it’s clear that you’ve
both been brought here to
find the same fix for your
mutual addiction. It’s
very intimate. This is the
reason you came – to be
part of a culture, member
in a society, dancer within
a rave. With a sluggish,
fuzzy feeling you turn
back to look unfocusedly
at the DJ booth where a
black silhouette fiddles
with turntables and dials.
Just as the night has
begun, it seems, your
friends motion upwards.
With a sinking feeling,
you know the night has
come to a close.
Dark. The shimmering
from the streetlight down
the road dazzles your
eyes. You push your cold
hands deeper into your
pockets as you admire the
steam from your breath.
It’s 3am; you’re wearing

Pussy is a
punk band
hailingfrom
Philadelphia, Patience
is the group’s 3rd LP,
and their first on indie
label Epitaph, home to
Weezer, Rancid and The
Offspring among others.
While patience brims
with sizzling guitar lines
and raucous drums, it’s
production (courtesy of
emo veteran Will Yip)
gives the record enough
space to conjure a range
of emotions.
Shorter tracks like
‘Drunk I’ and ‘Clams’,
bring the high tem-
to hate the way you are?”
add to the track, result-
ing in a punky-power
ballad worthy of serious
pop rotation.
Patience is well worth
a listen for any punk or
indie fan, as it exquisite-
ly toes the line between
a violent, viscera spew-
ing romp and a more
introspective, emo in-
fluenced collection of
tracks. And it’s less than
half an hour!
po head bopping ener-
gy hardcore punk fans
live for. These tracks
bowl the listener over in
waves of distorted guitar
and screamed vocals,
Meanwhile, intro-
spective lyrics and at-
mospheric, shoegazey
instrumentals, make
tracks like ‘Drunk I’ and
‘High Horse’ veritable
highlights of this tour
de force. “..the nights
I called you/I was so
fucked up/I forgot we
were breaking up/I still
love you, you stupid
fuck” croons Marisa
Dabice (lead singer/gui-
tarist) over fuzzed-out
guitar. The harmonic
depth of the songwrit-
ing adds power to her
intimate and vulnerable
lyricism.
‘Who You Are’ is a
great example of this.
With a hook buillt
around vi-I intervals,
stirs up angst reminis-
cent of hardcore/emo
bands: Tiger’s Jaw, Rilo

grooves, floating synths
and a sticky sweet horn
section. I had the fortune
of stumbling across their
debut LP Bedroom Tapes
over christmas, and have
found myself listening
regularly since.
The tunes here ease
the listener in with spa-
cious melodic hooks, or-
nametented with languid
snyths. Where they go
from here however, is
anyones guess.
Track ‘Libre’ chooses
to excentuate its melo-
dies with intertwining
horn harmonies, while
‘Dimmsdale’ and ‘Re-
sent’ opt for more rau-
cus solos, the opener in
particular, is notable for
its squaking sax-work.
‘Lake’ is notable for
its blown out drums &
RnB vocals.
With their debut, Ebi
Soda have successfully
carved a nook of their
own in the new jazz
movement, a pleasant
listen for aficionados
and newcomers alike.

you’d be tired at this time
