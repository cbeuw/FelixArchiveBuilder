The Crimson Petal and the White: A Vivid Picture of
Victorian London
Michael Faber’s behemoth 895-page book may seem daunting, but within its pages lies a fearless and intelligent
exploration of theme and setting that any fan of literary fiction should enjoy

I
am not going to lie;
this book initially
scared me. With its
895 pages of his-
torical literary fiction, it
presented a challenge and
its mere appearance on my
shelf demanded respect.
Don’t get me wrong.
It was not the page count
alone that was terrifying - I
frequently devour colossal
fantasy tomes without
trepidation. However, my
reading pace significantly
slows down when it
comes to works that err
towards a literary fiction
style. There is something
about the genre that
commands your constant
attention - and that can be
exhausting.
In spite of my reserva-
tions, The Crimson Petal
and the White pleasantly
surprised me with its read-
ability and robust writing
style. Its enthralling story-
telling pulled me in right
from the first sentence,
which goes like this:
“Watch your step. Keep
your wits about you; you
will need them. This city I
am bringing you to is vast
and intricate, and you
have not been here before.
You may imagine, from
other stories you’ve read,
that you know it well, but
those stories flattered
you, welcoming you as a
friend, treating you as if
you belonged. The truth is
that you are an alien from
another time and place
altogether...”
Employing an omnis-
cient narrator is a tactic
that does not always pay
off – but the world this
book was inviting me
into from my comfortable
and well-lit bedroom was
so richly gruesome, with
just the right amount of
light to balance out the
darkness. A description of
the dim, cobbled street full
of beggars and horse shit,
pouring rain and the smell
of urine is almost enough
to turn you away. But at
the end of that street is a
pub, light and warm, full
of hazy patrons - and there
is a story unfolding within
it.
Almost voyeuristically,
you want to step closer
and take a look; there is a
temptation to explore and
experience as you invisi-
bly follow first one char-
acter then the next, in a
manner that is not dissim-
ilar to Harry Potter’s visits
into the Pensieve. This
“This enables
the author
to explore
characters
in-depth,
and lay them
against the
rich backdrop
of Victorian
London”
way of gently inviting you
in and guiding you along
makes for a smooth flow
that enables the author to
explore a number of char-
acters in great depth, and
lay them against the rich
backdrop of a veiled and
nearly-tangible Victorian
London.
Faber gives the book an
almost Dickensian atmos-
phere but with prose that
is distinctly modern and
unabashedly uncensored
- something that would
probably evoke more than
a few gasps were it to be
published in Mr. Dickens’
times. He achieves tangi-
bility by not shying away
from fearlessly describing
even the most taboo of
details - the protagonist’s
red and flaky skin that
is likely psoriasis, the
various liquids and
vaginal douches pros-
titutes used to prevent
getting pregnant, the
sounds and smells of the
sewage-clogged streets.
He weaves them in
expertly, again and again
– and the result is as vivid
as a photograph.
Indelicate and brutally
honest in its portrayal,
this wonderfully irrever-
ent novel follows Sugar
– a prostitute, yes, but
perhaps more importantly
an exceptionally intelli-
gent young woman. She
performs her job well;
so well, in fact, that she
is known far and wide
for it. But what makes
her unique is her shrewd
ability to hold conversa-
tion with the men that seek
her out for a quick shag,
but then stay - and inevi-
tably keep coming back.
As her life slowly and
inexplicably intertwines
first with high-society
gentleman Mr. William
Rackham and then with
a cast of highbrow and
lowbrow characters from
all walks of life, she ends
up changing the course of
all their lives forever. And
the journey is riveting.
Revealing the plot
any further would, in my
opinion, take from the
As a result, this
behemoth of a book (and,
with its 895 pages, it can’t
be called anything else)
very masterfully explores
themes of class differ-
ences and exploitation of
the poor - which in my
opinion is the cherry on
top that makes it not just
an entertaining read but an
insightful one as well.
So I would implore you:
if you’ve ever wondered
what it would be like to
take a walk along the
streets of old Victorian
London, follow along -
embark on the journey of
Sugar in Michael Fabre’s
The Crimson Petal and
the White.

book, even though the
story itself is not complex.
Instead, its beauty lies
in its unique, colourful,
and detailed characters
that mesmerisingly come
to life on the canvas of
1870s London, that is
complete with realistic
political machinations of
its society.
