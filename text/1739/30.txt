Should you care about the Oscars?
The nominations are in, the elite are gathering, but should you really care about the 92nd Academy Awards?

W
ith the
r e c e n t
announce-
ment of the
nominations for the 92nd
Academy Awards, there
comes a host of backlash
on social media with
many people weighing in
on the issue. From some
of the more obvious snubs
(namely Greta Gerwig
for best director), to
some more Uncut Gems
we wished could have
made it on the list (pun
intended), there seems to
be something askew; but
what’s new?
With every year of
Oscar nominations there
comes a new wave of
criticism or controversy,
and so this year were you
really expecting any dif-
ferent? The long standing
imbalance and unfairness
in the academy stems
from years of elitism in
Hollywood, manifested
from systematic racism
and sexism that has long
been apparent. In this
respect, the film industry
is still in recovery after
having stood with such an
imbalance for so long. In
2012 a study conducted
found The Academy to
have a membership of
94% white, 77% male,
and 86% age 50 or older.
This is an absolutely
unacceptable figure that
clearly does not represent
the film industry as it
stands today.
This isn’t to say that
The Academy hasn’t been
trying to diversify their
membership. Since 2016
they’ve been committed
to try to decrease some of
these numbers. Inviting
more women and minori-
ties, each year has moved
a little closer to a more
representative version
of the film industry as it
stands today, and yet still
an overwhelming misrep-
resentation endures.
So we know that there’s
a huge imbalance in the
voting members of The
Academy, that much is
apparent, but what this
doesn’t explain is the
overwhelming praise that
Joker has received this
year. I mean come on, 11
nominations? Now a lot
of these come from the
behind the scenes staff
in costumes, make-up,
sound editing and others;
I can hardly claim to be
any expert in any of these
fields, but from what I can
tell these are fairly just.
So it begs the question,
has there ever been such
a disappointing film
that excelled in so many
specific categories?
Breaking down the
awards in this way you
can really begin to see
where the flaws lie. If I
“The Academy
has a
membership
of 94% white,
77% male,
86% age 50 or
older”
“The Joker is a
Frankenstein
of a film
that when
dissected
into different
aspects,
appears as
though it
shines”
were to select the perfect
parts of different humans
and combine them to one,
I wouldn’t have a perfect
human, I’d have a Frank-
enstein. In a lot of ways
this is what Joker is, it’s a
Frankenstein of a film that
when dissected into dif-
ferent aspects it appears as
though it shines; the only
glaring blunders I can see
in this nomination are
for Best Picture and Best
Adapted Screenplay, what
was the academy thinking
here?
With a wealth of ex-
cellent films this year, it
does come as a welcome
inclusion that Parasite
has been recognised as
one of the stand-out films
of the year, receiving a
host of nominations in-
cluding Best Director and
Best Picture. Yet some
equally brilliant films
have been given far less
praise in this ceremony.
We saw Awkwafina take
home Best Actress in a
Comedy or Musical at
the Golden Globes for
her excellent performance
in The Farewell. But the
brilliantly moving film set
in China, with outstanding
direction from female
director Lulu Wang, has
been given 0 nominations
despite being hailed as
one of the best films of the
year. This together with
Uncut Gems, A Portrait
of a Lady on Fire, and
others (that you will have
to forgive me for leaving
out), showcase the real
unfairness when you start
comparing them to what
have been nominated.
All three of these films
mentioned are (in my
opinion) worlds better
than the likes of Joker and
Jojo Rabbit, yet have been
wholly excluded from this
awards ceremony.
I find myself wonder-
ing if the voting members
of the Academy have seen
a lot of the Best Picture
long list of nominations,
why the Oscars regularly
only highlight the ‘big’
films of the year and often
fail to negate some of the
smaller excellent films.
Let’s also not forget that
The Academy is an organ-
isation compromised by
huge body of Hollywood
elites where (in 2012)
one third of the members
had received an Oscar
previously. This damning
statistic really does point
to the overtly clear fact
that the Oscars is merely
one great attempt at
Hollywood giving them-
selves one huge pat on
the back for another year
of making millions in the
film industry. With the
exception of some of the
smaller categories appear-
ing slightly more earnest-
ly throughout the night,
you really do need to
keep things in perspective
when considering what is
‘good’ by the numbers of
Oscars it wins.
Perhaps one of the only
upsides to the Oscars
is year in year out, it
highlights the inequality
in the film industry and
brings awareness to the
sexism and racism insti-
tuted by the Academy as a
subsidiary of Hollywood.
More and more people
are beginning to take
action on this and a no-
ticeable shift in people’s
attitudes towards cinema
is moving towards greater
and greater inclusivity. If
nothing, the Oscars give
some very influential
people a huge platform
with which to convey a
message on the state of
Hollywood, with some
individuals choosing to
make a statement.
So if you’re watching
the Oscars this year,
remember to take them
with a pinch of salt; the
nominations are floored,
the ceremony is grandi-
ose, and it lacks a true
representation of all that
was great in cinema this
year. The Academy is
getting better, but it’s still
got a long way to go.
