How to Bake Pi: A Heady Mix of Mathematics, Logic,
and Baking
BOOKS
Ameena Hassan
Puzzles Editor
E
ugenia Cheng’s
book How to
Bake with Pi was
a can-opener in
a way that most books
have never been. Without
the aim of educating the
reader, it gives simple
recipes for ‘fancy’ meals,
with a mathematical con-
text attached. Working off
the best (or worst!) pun in
mathematics - the ratio of
a circle’s circumference
to its diameter being deli-
cious - this book is one for
all the puns.
Likewise, this book
goes on - each chapter
is a recipe and a short
passage on a mathemat-
ical concept. This slim
edition was a gift (both
figuratively and literally);
while I tend to view
mathematics as an ad-
venture, Cheng seems to
revel in the mathematics
of food. Or the food of
mathematics - you really
can’t tell. After having
read it over the break, I
still can’t say if it’s a book
on mathematics, logic, or
baking. Maybe it’s one on
all three.
This book is perfect for
the layperson with a free
afternoon, perfect like a
cinnamon roll on a rainy
day in a way most books
on math aren’t. It’s as
“Every chapter
is another
leaf out of a
cookbook,
another dish
not in your
family’s lexicon
of foods”
much fun to have a read-
through as it is to make
the recipes described.
Recipes are simple and
easy to follow, fitting with
the general ages of its
audience - young people
learning about mathe-
matics outside the class,
and who are still not very
sure about how to make
lasagne.
A recipe for porridge
popped up in the middle
- this book will surprise
you in its variety and
may remind you of an
encyclopedia you might
have once owned. Every
chapter is another leaf out
of a cookbook, another
dish not always in your
family’s lexicon of foods.
Coming to university and
having to feed yourself
is extremely daunting
amongst all the other first
experiences it brings;
this book lets you take
a step back, delve into
something as complex
as category theory, and
come back to take a bite
of vegan brownies.
Maybe the adventure
isn’t how you get there
in the end, but the food
you ate along the way.
Anyway, it was refreshing
to read what Eugenia
thought about the number
five - even if I still burn
rice, it’s nice to know
what a bechamel sauce is.
(Something I thought was
too fancy-sounding for
me to make, but gosh is it
great with pasta.)
If you don’t like
savoury, you might like
sweet. Don’t worry,
there’s a recipe for pi too,
although I have yet to try
it!
