Antigone: 2020 Edition
F
or those not
familiar with
S o p h o c l e s ’
Theban tragedy,
you may still have heard
of the tale of Oedipus - the
man fated to fall in love
with his mother. Well,
Antigone is the story of
the four children born out
of his incestuous relation-
ship. The two brothers
Polynices and Eteocles
are off at war with each
other. After returning,
one is a hero and one is a
traitor, but both are dead.
Antigone and Ismene,
their two sisters, are left
to deal with the grief and
when Antigone insists
on honouring the “bad “
brother with a proper fu-
neral things escalate very
quickly.
In this version of
Antigone, written by Lulu
Raczka, much of this plot
is not explored in much
depth in this production,
with a magnifying glass
being held up to the
relationship between
Antigone and Esmene.
Themes of adolescence,
independance and sexu-
ality are explored as well
as the classic theme of
morality.
The opening, with the
two teenage actors rising
from the literal pit of dirt
and getting ready to go
out with a little Destiny’s
Child interlude is con-
ducted with no dialogue
and yet still manages to
introduce the strong bond
between the sisters. The
performance begins with
a long opening babble
about the girl’s big night
on the town. For those
not familiar with the
storyline, the plot itself
was not made clear until
about 20 minutes in.
While this long opening
babble explores ideas
of sexuality, there was a
lack of direction leaving
the audience grasping for
more substance.
Throughout the pro-
duction, the colloquialism
injected into the tense
dialogue sometimes
waters down the gravity
of the themes being dis-
cussed. Yes, this adapta-
tion is meant to bring the
story closer to home for
young people, but using
“like” every other word
isn’t always the way to do
it.
Overall, the perfor-
mance does hit home and
make the audience think
about themes that were
not present in the original
story. Antigone (played
by Annabel Baldwin) and
her younger sister Ismene
(played by Rachel Hosker)
capture every last drop of
the audience’s attention
from start to finish with
their urgent and powerful
performances. At one of
the tensest moments in
the play, Baldwin’s mono-
logue, where she exposes
her internal struggles with
what is right or wrong
cuts through directly to
the audience. Hosker’s
final monologue dealing
with grief elevated the
entire performance and
cemented her in my mind
as the real talent to watch
from this production. If
you are looking for a truly
mesmerising performance
put together by lots of new
talent, this production is
perfect for you, no prior
knowledge needed!
Cirque du Soleil: Luzia
C
irque du
Soleil’s most
recent show
to grace the
Royal Albert Hall stage
is Luzia, a colourful cre-
ation said to be inspired
by Mexican culture and
sponsored by the coun-
try of Mexico itself.
Luzia is, at times,
a display of the cast’s
immense talent, however,
the overall show was
plagued by a sense of
monotony. The acrobatic
acts felt outdated, and
these were few and far in
between random comedic
actsthatwerefranklyquite
unfunny. This included
an extended whistling
sequence, that might have
been funny for the first
3 minutes, but quickly
lost its charm. There was
no sense of urgency or
enthrallment, bar a swing
set sequence near the end
of the second act. Addi-
tionally, a confusing im-
portance was placed on an
act which simply involved
some football tricks. Are
we all left to presume that
Mexicans like football?
Some of the show’s
main redeeming qualities
were its impeccable
costumes, sound and
lighting design, and a
novel and creative display
of waterworks. The
music, although having
an authentic feel to it, was
mainly forgettable. The
use of puppetry was also
mainly successful: lifesize
beetles, armadillos and
ants were, to my surprise,
cuter than they were
creepy. A horse puppet
operated by three men
came across as clumsy in
the first act, but served a
better purpose later in the
show. Still, War Horse did
a better job with horse
puppetry.
As aforementioned,
an important role was
bestowed upon a tall
waterfall which randomly
appeared in the middle of
almost each individual act,
albeit in different ways
every time. A particularly
impressive use of this dis-
played the water falling
in unique formations.
A recurring philosophy
during the making of this
show seems to be ‘when
int doubt, soak everything
with a giant waterfall’.
Just when you thought
the water thing had been
overused, the stage turned
into a giant pool, from
which a cast member
ascends via a network
of vines to swing around
countless times (just like
P!nk has been doing for
well over a decade) along-
side a giant puppet of a
cheetah.
Unfortunately, Luzia
does not indulge in
Mexican culture nearly
as much as it could
have. However, it does
have its visual moments
of near-brilliance. An
honourable mention
goes to the curtain which
descends at the end of the
first act. This curtain is
intricately designed with
Mexican motives and
gives a minimal amount of
authenticity to the show.
Overall, Luzia is
visually striking but
lacking in substance. It’s
hard to avoid making
comparisons to Coco, a
recent Pixar movie, which
is a true celebration of
the Mexican culture. It
does say a lot that about
80% of all the applause
during Luzia was directly
requested, nay, demanded
from the audience. One
can’t help but wonder if
this signifies the end of
the circus.
The staging emphasizes the bond between the two sisters. // Dee McCourt
