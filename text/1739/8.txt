A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week Felix spoke to the Deputy President (Finance and Services), Fifi Henry, about the Summer Ball, The
Sustainibility and Services Board, and food in 568 and hbar.
Felix: Lots of big
projects you’ve
been working on
over the past couple
of months and the
Christmas break –
probably the largest
and most pressing is
Summer Ball, which
you are leading on
and organizing this
year. How is that
going?
FH: The background story
to this is that previously,
the Summer Ball has
sat with the Events and
Conference Manager in
the Commercial Services
directorate. They left at
the start of October, and
so there was nobody to
pick it up as it’s a massive
project. The head of the
directorate proposed to
cancel the Ball, which was
presented to the Board of
Trustees – who provide
oversight of the Union
from internal and external
sources.
decided that the really
important thing moving
forward was for all of our
services to be sustainable
– economically viable
and environmentally
friendly – but the core of
it is ensuring the students’
needs are met, and that all
of our services are doing
everything for them.
Again, the SSB has a great
set of dedicated students,
and we decided there are
two big things we wanted
to do. One is to have a
big sustainability project,
and the other is to look
into the staff welfare side
of things – the different
policies that affect our
student staff.
The overarching sustain-
ability project is coming
into fruition this term,
with several campaigns
beneath it. The first is the
‘Planetary Health Diet’
campaign launching next
month; it piggybacks off
of ‘Meat-Free Mondays’
from last year, but doesn’t
promote a vegetarian
or vegan perspective as
much. It doesn’t tell you
to remove meat from your
diet. It looks instead at
what foods are best for
you in terms of health, as
well as those foods’
environmental impact. So,
for example, it promotes
eating things like chicken
over consuming more red
meats, compares different
types of nuts in terms of
water consumption, and
so on. The idea is to get
students to consider what
they are purchasing – it’s
a knowledge piece, which
is great. Last year, Meat-
Free Mondays helped
a lot of students realise
that things like beef and
lamb have a much bigger
environmental impact
than some might realise. It
pushes that positive effect
further, highlighting foods
that are great for you as
well as the environment.
There’ll be different activ-
Fifi Henry, the DPFS // ICU
otherwise it would
have been cancelled.
You’re still doing
everything else the
DPFS has always
done, with this on
top. Are you receiv-
ing support from
other staff members
in the Union?
FH: There is support.
Marketing have been
great – we had a meeting
to discuss what we wanted
to do when we knew what
the theme was. They
quickly drafted up some
beautiful posters; I really
think they are stunning, so
I can’t wait for everyone
to see it on Monday.
There are people within
the Commercial Services
remit who have definitely
offered support, and there
are people in Beit bars who
have worked Balls before
and have a lot of experi-
ence and knowledge, and
have been able to provide
insight. I’ve not run an
event on this scale before,
so there are some concerns
there, but there’s a good
support network – and
everyone on the Summer
Ball Committee all have
relevant experience and
know what they’re doing.
Without them it wouldn’t
work, so really credit to
that team to be honest.
Felix: As big a project
as this is, it’s only
a part of your role.
I know you’ve also
been doing a lot of
work with the Servic-
es and Sustainability
Board (SSB) recently,
planning several
campaigns. Can you
tell us about those
plans?
FH: The SSB is a new
board approved by Union
Council this year – more
work to do! – which means
I could shape it however I
wanted, which is really
exciting. I could define
its terms of reference. I
I made the argument that
it was a fundamental
part of the student expe-
rience – that it not only
celebrates the end of the
year and their exams,
and for many the end of
their degrees as it’s the
biggest event right before
their graduations. We as a
Union don’t do as many
big-scale events as maybe
we should, and don’t do
as many big recognition
pieces to celebrate all that
our students do. I felt it
was really important that
it still had to happen, and
the only way to make that
work was to take on the
responsibility myself –
but I knew I could do it, as
I’d already reached out to
several key student stake-
holders, such as the Arts
and Entertainment Board,
DramSoc, and members
of the student bar team,
who each are involved
either in organizing or
running the ball.
There are about 10
students on the new
Summer Ball Committee
as a result – previously
the Ball was fully organ-
ised by staff members at
the Union – and we meet
two hours every week
to discuss and organise,
sign off things like risk
assessments, and so on.
Our main project for
first term was to create a
budget and break down
the costings of everything,
and broadly defining our
financial approach. The
Board agrees that the
Ball is not meant to be
a Commercial Services
project, rather a Student
Experience project, and
is not meant to be run in
order to make a profit. So
the plan is for it to break
even – and if a loss is
made, then as long as it’s
an experience students
enjoy and are happy with
then we can absorb it
into the Union’s financial
reserves. If overspending
slightly means students
have a good time, we’ll
overspend slightly.
We’ve sorted out our
headliner – though we
aren’t announcing it quite
yet, we can confirm it’s
a live act and not a DJ!
– and the theme this year
is ‘Enchanted Forest’. In
the past we’ve suggested
options and had students
vote – this year we put it
out there for anything and
everything to be submit-
ted as ideas. We had some
really strange things come
up in there, for sure, but
one of the most prominent
thoughts that came up,
and which the Summer
Ball Committee really felt
we could strongly deliver
in terms of dressing the
environment to fit the
theme, was enchanted
forest. The posters
should be going up soon,
as the ﬂash sale begins
on Monday at 12 – so
everyone keep your eyes
out for that! From there
we’ll be slowly releasing
more information, setting
up some fun initiatives
which will allow people to
get free tickets, and so on.
I think a big difference
this year is that this year
it is being organised by
students, so it’s a lot more
relevant to what students
want.Previouslytherewas
little student input – there
were some consultations
done, but they weren’t
really pushed. We’ve also
taken on feedback
that people in the past
have spent £50 on a ticket
and felt they didn’t get as
much out of it as they’d
want – so this year, we’re
raising the maximum
ticket value (by around
£15, but that’s not fully
certain yet), but it will ad-
ditionally include a main
and dessert and a prosecco
reception, as well as the
fact that the headliner will
be a live act. It’s small but
significant experiential
improvements that don’t
too drastically affect
ticket prices.
We’re also looking into
sponsorship opportunities,
trying to get other organi-
sations engaged and more
money coming in we can
make something better
for students. So there’s
a lot going on there, it’s
quite overwhelming, but
very exciting. I’m hoping
we can change people’s
opinions about the Ball –
people previously often
felt it wasn’t worth the
money, but came anyway.
We’re hoping this year
they’ll come anyway,
and find that it was worth
it – and feel that this was
what they wanted to do to
celebrate the end of their
year!
Felix: This is a colos-
sal amount of work
– and that’s just been
tacked on to your
role this year because
