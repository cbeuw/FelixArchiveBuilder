rawing in-
fluence from
the lineage of
genres spawn-
ing from the late 50’s
Jamaican sound system
culture, where “sound
clash” competitions were
fundamental, grime has
historically held clashes
and beefs between artists
as sacrosanct. Jammer’s
iconic Lord of the Mics is
testament to that – a series
that saw MCs sparring bar
for bar, its first instalment
being recorded in the
grime legend’s basement
back in 2004. Since then,
grime has evolved and
reinvented itself. 2015
stands out as the year of
the genre’s biggest second
wind, catalysed by a
grime war spearheaded by
Chip’s viral clashes with
Bugzy and Yungen. Thus,
grime’s next phase, that
of its greatest commercial
successes, was built off of
clashes. The new grime
war that has unfolded
over the past few months,
climaxing in clashes
between Wiley – grime’s
undisputed godfather
and Stormzy – its most
successful commercial
output, could point to an
exciting reignition of the
scene’s innate personality
and energy.
The typically convo-
luted timeline of this one
started with Dot Rotten
sending for Jay1, before
going on to attack a host
of other big names in
grime over the course of
12 dubs in total. Wiley got
involved, ever the manic
clashing veteran, dragging
“... asserting
that Wiley only
mentioned his
name in the
first place for
clout”

Artist: Wiley.
Eediyat Skengman 1
response track was the
start of Stormzy’s involve-
ment, Wiley responding
by mocking both artists’
collaboration with Ed
Sheeran. After some back
and forth, Wiley dropped:
Artist: Stormzy.
Disappointed
A lot of the bars here are
lazy, generic assertions
that he will always be the
original to other rappers’
imitations. The most
direct attack on Stormzy
is: “You never cared about
grime, you just used it /
Worse than Ed with your
watered down music”.
Surprisingly, despite
a response being nones-
sential for someone as
successful as Stormzy,
he returned with his own
dub:
any niceties, immediate-
ly getting personal by
bringing up an altercation
between himself and
Wiley’s brother, before
asserting that Wiley only
mentioned his name in
the first place for clout.
Artist: Wiley.

Still Disappointed
her head” made me laugh
the first time I heard it, but
overall the track is more
of the same and just sees
Wiley emphasising that he
feels Stormzy hasn’t paid
his dues to himself and
other pioneering grime
MCs.

A tweet asking Wiley
when he would respond to
Jaykae’s scathing ‘Shush’ Stormzy didn’t spare
He also mocks Wiley’s
erratic behaviour towards
him whilst bragging about
his commercial success,
saying: “Wiley’s a prick
cos he loves talking shit
then he sobers up and
then begs it / I’m so big
the only thing bigger than
me last year was Brexit”.
“He cleverly
toys the line
between
mercilessly
shaming and
belittling
sympathy in
his bars””
“... overall the
track is just
more of the
same...”
“If I see your mum down
Croydon market I’m
gonna rip that weave off
The best track to come
out of the clash. Stormzy
employs Pusha T level
savagery by presenting
the embarrassing, pitiful
reality of Wiley having
moved his mum to Cyprus
due to threat of violence
his past has imposed.
He cleverly toys the line
between mercilessly
shaming and belittling
sympathy in his bars –
“Got so much money I
want to lend her”.
A decent dub, but
Wiley’s itching to have
more material on Stormzy
is audible. He is made to
spend bars disputing the
claims about his mother
and offers more flat shots
about Stormzy’s image
and legacy. It would seem
grime’s godfather has
officially gone stale.
