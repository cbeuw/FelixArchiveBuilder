Imperial Lecturer Apologises for Calling Students
“Weak” and “Lazy” in Exam Report

A lecturer in the Aer-
onautics department has
apologised to students
after an exam report
from January 2019 was
revealed, in which he
described students as
“particularly weak” and
“particularly lazy”.
Professor Paul Robin-
son, the Aeronautics Head
of Department, said: “The
member of staff responsi-
ble for the report is an ex-
tremely passionate teacher
with excellent student
feedback. Regrettably, on
this occasion they were
particularly dismayed
by the nature and extent
of errors in the students’
answers and, in a momen-
tary lapse of judgement,
vented their frustration in
the exam feedback. The
staff member regrets their
choice of language and
apologises to students for
the offence this caused.”
The controversial
report was made availa-
ble on the department’s
sharepoint – a document
management and storage
system used across the
College – and was visible
to students. The document
has since been removed.
The document sparked
frustration and anger
amongst students, particu-
larly amongst the stress of
the ongoing 2020 January
exams, which several
students had begun to vent
about on social media.
Prior to being removed,
clips of the report were
shared on Facebook,
reading in full: “these
are trivial errors, which
should normally lead to
students failing not only
A-levels but even GCSE.
How these students got
into Imperial is hard to un-
derstand”, and “I am very
disappointed. It looks like
the number of particularly
weak or particularly lazy
students is unusually large
this year.”
The reports are de-
signed and intended to
provide feedback to stu-
dents post-exam.
A College spokesper-
son said: “We regret that a
recent exam report avail-
able to Aeronautics stu-
dents on the department’s
sharepoint site contained
inappropriate comments
about the general results
of an exam from last
year. The intention of representatives also
criticised usage of the
platform for launching
anonymous personal
attacks – rather than going
through structures such as
the reps and the Student
Staff Committee – and
believed the situation on
social media was ‘getting
out of hand’.
This follows on from
controversy last year over
an open letter submitted
to the Aeronautics de-
partment by second-year
students – the same cohort
about which the exam
report was written last
year – complained about
unfair courseloads and
stress levels. The letter
reportedly caused friction
between academic reps
and staff in Student Staff
Committees, after several
representatives expressed
frustration that their
concerns were shut down
with comments such as
“industry doesn't push
back deadlines.”
Several students,
however, have anony-
mously expressed the
sentiment that the depart-
ment is making efforts to
improve, and commented
that the lecturer in ques-
tion was “good in-class.”
Aeronautics is not the
only Engineering depart-
ment to have experienced
difficulties this January
exam season. The Bioen-
gineering department also
received complaints after
an exam was delayed by
almost an hour and a half.
The issue was reportedly
caused by a conflict
between the College's
anti-virus software and
software needed for the
exam.
A spokesperson for the
Department of Bioen-
gineering said: “We are
sorry that an unforeseen
technology issue involv-
ing the College’s anti-vi-
rus software caused a
delay to the start time of a
3 hour live programming
exam for 2nd year Bioen-
gineering students.
“As soon as the Depart-
ment became aware of the
issue, which was outside
of our responsibility and/
or control, we alerted ICT
to find a solution. In order
to minimise disruption
to students and prevent a
knock-on effect on their
revision for other exams,
we opted not to resched-
ule the exam - instead ICT
sought a solution while
students remained in the
room. The exam began
approximately 1h and
25 minutes after it was
scheduled to, and students
were given the full time to
complete it.
“We understand the
frustration this will have
caused during an already
stressful time and are very
grateful to our students
for their patience and help
as we worked to find a
solution.
“The Faculty of Engi-
neering team are working
with ICT to ensure similar
issues do not arise in
future. We will liaise with
our 2nd year students
regarding the issue via
the Staff Student Liaison
Committee, and the issue
will also be reported to
the Board of Examiners
to consider and note its
impact on the students."
This did, however,
prompt some students to
question how the issue had
not been caught before the
exam took place.
