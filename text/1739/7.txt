the likelihood of getting
caught higher, or adjust
the consequence to make
getting caught worse.
Unfortunately, despite
the number of people that
read the Daily Mail and
love the idea of flaying
people alive for shoplift-
ing chewing gum, there
are issues with raising the
level of consequence.
Strong consequences,
at a level that would
completely discourage
crime suffer from societal
perception. Returning to
MAD, nuclear disarma-
ment campaigners take
action against nuclear
weapons because they
feel they are an immoral
solution to the problem
of inter-state violence.
Governments are more
able to ignore this issue
because whether a nation
has nuclear weapons does
not undermine its overall
legitimacy in the eyes of
the people. At least, not at
the moment.
However, it is a differ-
ent matter entirely when
it comes to justice. A
government’s legitimacy
in the eyes of the people
it governs is hugely
impacted by its ability
to deliver justice to the
population that it is gov-
erning. If a government is
able to deliver fair and ap-
propriate justice as judged
by its people, it is a legit-
imate government. If not,
then it becomes less of a
legitimate government
and rules by repression.
In democracies where
the people are somewhat
important in determining
who is to govern, accept-
able punishments are a
necessity. At present these
acceptable punishments in
being left to suffocate to
death. If you were particu-
larly fortunate you would
be mercifully garrotted or
have your throat slashed.
This form of punish-
ment is high risk for the
government executing
an individual.. Firstly,
there is the chance that
the person that is being
executed in this manner
is innocent. To execute
a guilty man this way
could be acceptable, but
to execute an innocent
man this way would be a
horrific and irrevocable
injustice. This would
impact the legitimacy of
the regime dispensing
this justice. Additionally,
there is the possibility that
the punishment does not
match the crime. Breaking
on the wheel was a pun-
ishment for highwaymen
and robbers. This may
have seemed appropriate
at the time. However,
applying this punishment
to a starving thief aiming
to support a large starving
family may have been
viewed differently by the
mobs watching. It may
have led to deterrence, but
the fact that justice was
seen to be misapplied by
the mob would undermine
the government’s legiti-
macy. These two issues,
the potential for innocent
victims and ensuring that
the punishment fits the
crime, make extreme pun-
ishment a less attractive
option for governments
aiming to deter crime,
despite the possibility that
it may be effective.
There is also the
risk-underestimation
factor of the potential
criminal that plagues the
world due to the preva-
lence of people failing
to consider negative
options. In this case the
prospect of a terrifying
punishment has not been
effective as a result of the
small likelihood that they
would not get away with
it. As a current gambling
ad says, “when there’s a
chance, there’s always
a chance.” The number
of people that play the
lottery further confirms
this situation. There is a
large possibility that the
government will have to
punish a large number of
people extremely, simply
because each thought they
would never be caught.
This problem of over-pun-
ishment can be seen par-
ticularly in the US, where
fixed term sentences have
been applied to people
committing minor crimes
such as the possession of
weed. Whether this was
actually a disadvantage
for the government that
brought it in (Republican)
is another matter, but
clearly deterrence through
harsh punishment failed
in this situation. It has
also undermined the legit-
imacy of the US regime in
the eyes of a significant
portion of the US popula-
when they were being
observed. Therefore, the
only way for the prisoners
to rationally avoid punish-
ment was to behave well
all the time. I believe that
the same logic has been
applied by many mod-
ern-day governments that
use far-reaching and in-
trusive mass surveillance
techniques in order to
maintain an increased grip
on society without having
to resort to more extreme
or inhumane forms of
punishment. The Edward
Snowden leaks provide
conclusive evidence of
this in the Western world.
Other governments, such
as Russia and China, are
also relying increasingly
on surveillance to more
effectively control their
populations.
Surveillance has
further advantages. When
coupled with a large
number of police and
other state actors, it can
be used to prevent and
predict crimes of passion.
This raises the further
question: is the cost to our
individual privacy worth
the safety we think that it
provides?
“Acceptable
punishments
in the UK
are prison
sentences and
fines”
the UK are prison sentenc-
es of a given length, fines,
or community service. In
the past, punishments that
would have been accept-
able include something
called “breaking on the
wheel”. To be broken on
the wheel was to have all
your limbs broken and
then braided through the
spokes of a wheel before

In the late 1700s, the
utilitarian philosopher
Jeremy Bentham came up
with a novel concept for
a new modern prison to
force the good behaviour
of its inmates: the pano-
pticon. The panopticon
consisted of a system
of cells where each of
the inmates could be
observed at any time by
the prison warden and
crucially would not know
