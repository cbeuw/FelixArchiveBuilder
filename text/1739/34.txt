shall investigate the last
question in depth.
The French economy at
a glance
First, an extensive
overview of the French
economic structure is
necessary. France is,
without doubt, the second
most important economic
driver in the European
Union, after Germany.
It is also home to many
native European corporate
conglomerates and banks,
such as the Dassault
Group and BNP Paribas.
Surprisingly, it is also
one the many countries in
breach of the Maastricht
criteria*. As seen in
Figure 1, its proportion of
industrialized goods sold
in the European Union
was standing at 12% in
2017 (the most recent
available data), albeit sig-
nificant, unproportionally
small compared to the role
France takes in the Eu-
rosystem, being less than
half of that of Germany
and even smaller than
Italy, a country deeply
entrenched in economic
stagnation and rising debt
levels.
French Debt Levels
But what does this
data have to do with the
protests? The logic is a
complicated one. One
must be aware that the
French government has
the habit of borrowing
in large amounts. Most
countries borrow, but
France borrows uncon-
FELIX
trollably. Sound economic
strategy requires a country
to reduce its debt level
during periods of growth
and the vice versa during
recession. France has
not recovered fully from
the 2008 crisis, evident
from the accumulating
debt from the last decade
seen in Figure 3. Refering
to Figure 2 and Figure
4, it begs questioning
why, when Germany had
turned into surplus in
2014, France remained in
deficit to this day? If one
determines it is the unsus-
tainable pension system
and public welfare of
France being the culprit,
the author agrees that it
is a major contributor. On
average, a Frenchman was
expected to receive a net
payment of 890EUR from
the French national gov-
ernment in 2018. Though
this number has been
steadilyreducedinthepast
years, the French public
seems to no longer accept
cuts to their benefits. Is
the policy of cutting social
welfare necessary for
France? Not if Emmanuel
Macron can find ways
to ask Dassault or BNP
Paribas to pay more tax.
Though if he wishes to
continue his presidency in
the next election, he must
not make these powerful
organizations his enemy.
As expected, the French
president has once again
decided to demand more
from his people than to
the ruling elite.
From Figure 3, French
public debt stood at
98.4% of GDP (2018),
and its deficit on the rise.
To restrain from further
bleeding, Macron had
no other choice but to
impose the fuel tax with
all of his reforms. In fact,
even if Mr. Macron was
selfless and demanded the
corporations to pay more,
the legislation would
never have passed in the
parliament - nevertheless
are these reforms and cuts
enough to cause massive
demonstrations on the
streets of Paris? Perhaps
not, though the author
believes they are merely
the fuse to larger social
discontent. Let us examine
it from an economic
perspective: Eight out of
every hundred in France
are currently unemployed.
And within that eight
people, three are suffering
from effects of long-term
structural unemployment.
Why is the unemployment
rate so high in France? In
contrast the German rate
hovers at only 3% and
Belgium at 5%. It could be
the effect of overlapping
business cycles, which
would be an unfortunate

Emmanuel Macron. The
French people voted him
into the Élysée palace in
2017. The ones before
him? Nicolas Sarkozy,
a right-wing politician
and François Hollande,
a left-wing leader. As far
as the author is aware, the
French public is currently
not in good terms with any
of the three. If the French
people do not like the
right, the left, or the center,
what is the problem? Is it
the rigid political system
of the Fifth Republic or
that of the bureaucracy
of the European Union?
Or is it the shrinking
economy with increasing
public debt? The author

after the Second World
War, it should not come as

is slowing down. Unless
the France would like to

long-cycled economic
growth to overheat and
boil over. After the 2008
