A
t CES
last week,
Samsung un-
veiled quite a
lot of products, of which
the Odyssey G9 was cov-
ered in last week’s issue.
This week would cover
some more products from
Samsung as well as other
tech headlines..
Samsung - The Sero
The Sero represents
Samsung’s highest-end
flagship television line.

thereof. This television
achieves a mind-blowing
99% screen-to-body ratio.
Samsung promises that
the display, aptly titled
“Infinity Screen,” would
deliver the best LCD
picture quality on the
market. Furthermore, it’s
speedy processor helps in
the upscaling of non-8K
content to “true-to-live
8K resolution.” Just like
4K, it’s inevitable that
8K would be the norm in
a few years time; though,
this year does look opti-
mistic for televisions.
Samsung Galaxy S10
Lite and Note 10 Lite
Samsung unveiled
two new semi-flagships
bearing the names of
two high-end, flagship
Samsung lines - Galaxy
Note and Galaxy S.
These two new phones,
the Galaxy S10 Lite and
Galaxy Note 10 Lite,
are similarly spec’d,
affordable offerings from
Samsung that, according
to the company, “Brings
Galaxy to More People.”
The phones are both
equipped with large,
4500 mAh batteries and
triple-camera modules,
with the S10 Lite having a
48 megapixel wide-angle
camera. Furthermore,
both phones have 6.7” Full
HD+ Super AMOLED In-
finity-O displays and share
the same amount of RAM
and internal storage for
Electric Air Taxi
Joby Aviation, a
company that look to be
the first in the electric air
taxi business, has received
$590 million dollars in
funding. Around $394
million came from its lead
investor Toyota, which
has had a long term vision
for air transportation.
This investment from
Toyota only firms up its
seriousness and dedication
towards achieving that
vision. Maybe in the next
decade we might actually
see the deployment and
widespread use of flying
cars, something that was
predicted and talked about
more than half a century
ago.
“Vision for
electronics
that blend
into our
surroundings”
Samsung QLED 8K
2020 - Q950TS
Apart from The Sero,
Samsung unveiled a
massive 85” QLED 8K
television. The most
striking part of the TV was
its bezels, or rather the lack

the base specifications.
The Galaxy Lite series
looks quite promising,
but it does question the
existence of the Galaxy
S10 E.
It represents Samsung’s
vision for electronics
that integrate well into
our daily lifestyle, es-
sentially blending into
our surroundings. The
TV does challenge the
conventional television
design that has stuck on
for more than a decade,
much like how Tesla’s
Cybertruck challenged
the design of a pickup.
The Sero has the ability
to rotate itself in order
to adapt to the content
playing on the large 43”
4K QLED panel. The idea
behind this is to mimic
the orientation of smart-
phones when streaming
content to the TV, which is
primarily targeted at those
who watch a lot of vertical
videos as those found on
Facebook, TikTok, Insta-
gram, and elsewhere. This
interesting device joins
Samsung’s Frame, which
was unveiled last year,
and is priced at £1230.
Microsoft Edge
Edge is back with
and new engine under
the hood - Chromium.
Although it does share
a lot of similarity with
Google’s offering, the
browser does indeed
compete with Chrome.
Edge does comes with
the standard features that
you’d find on almost any
other browser, but still
lacks features that make
it unique. To address this,
Microsoft does seem quite
optimistic about Edge’s
upcoming collections
feature, a kind of advanced
bookmarks manager /
mood board where you
store images, text, and
links for future reference.
Apart from this, Microsoft
has a lot of work to do in
the near future if it intends The Sero // Samsung Newsroom
