physics undergraduates
in his lab at Hammer-
smith hospital in order
to repeat the legendary
Stanford prison ex-
periment. This was in
response to claims that
results achieved in the
70s were no longer
reproducible due to
modern undergraduates’
elevated pain thresh-
olds. Initial results
were unpromising as
prisoners slept blissfully
while their guards beat
them with truncheons
and yelled abuse. The
breakthrough came
when Faylward changed
the disciplinary methods
used. Rather than resort-
ing to physical violence,
Faylward set his prison-
ers an exam at the end
of each day and guards
were instructed to ask
misbehaving prisoners
“Oh you haven’t read
that paper yet?”.
Feb Senton, one of
the participating student
guards, recounted the
effect this had on the
prison populace. “It was
hilarious. All I had to do is
open a folder and pretend
to read something. It only
took twenty minutes for
the majority of them to

The study has drawn
widespread condemnation
from human rights groups
and the Chinese embassy.
While the tones of anger
were similar the content
of the two complaints was
very different. While the
former argued that this
was inhumane treatment
the later voice concern that
the Falun Gong practicing
student study-participant
had left the study with
both kidneys.
The results of the study
are to be published later
this month in the world
renowned journal ‘In-
vestigations of the Royal
Society of Libertines’.The
Scottish government has
already expressed interest

Scottish education min-
ister, Nicola Red Snapper,
declared “What this study
tells us is that there are
better ways of educating
our students rather than
just beating them. We
look forward to following
a data driven approach
to bring our education
system into line with other
developed economies”.
