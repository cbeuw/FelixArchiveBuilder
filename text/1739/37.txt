L
et’s start with
an honest
admission: the
vast majority
of Postgraduate students
will be entirely unfamiliar
with the term ‘Constituent
Union.’ While many will
be aware of the Graduate
Students Union (GSU) as
something that pops into
their email inbox from
time to time, for most the
disparate other acronyms
(RCSU, CGCU, RSMU,
ICSMSU) are entirely
foreign. This should not
be surprising. Given that
Postgraduates are not
members of their Faculty
CU, and since their en-
gagement with the GSU
tends to be fairly limited,
be familiar with, or even
aware of, these organi-
sations. But this hasn’t
always been the case.
Until 2012, PGs were
members of both the
Graduate Students’ Asso-
ciation (predecessor to the
GSU) and their relevant
Faculty CU. There was a
clear division of respon-
sibility between the GSA,
which was responsible for
representing the interests
of Postgraduate students
across the College, and the
Faculty CUs, which were
responsible for building a
sense of Faculty commu-
nity. In 2012, following
scarcely any consultation
or scrutiny, PGs were
stripped of their Faculty
CU memberships and the
GSA was elevated to the
lofty status of Constituent
Union. This experiment
has failed, and has led to
further atomisation and
isolation of the Postgrad-
uate community.
For those who have not
had much involvement
with Faculty CUs, it
may seem odd to suggest
Postgrads ought to be
involved with them. After
all, all they do is organise
piss-ups, right? Well,
not really. Consider the
RCSU – yes, there are
piss-ups (and good ones,
at that), but there’s a lot
more. Broadsheet. The
RCSU magazine, which
has in the past featured
Postgraduate writers.
Science Challenge, their
science communication
competition, which every
year relies on Postgrad-
uate judges. BAHFest,
their annual comedy
event, which is run by a
Postgraduate. By barring
Postgrads from engaging
in these endeavours and
experiencing the rich
sense of history and
tradition that the Faculty
CUs offer, both the PG
experience and the activi-
ties of the Faculty CUs are
diminished.
There has been a lot of
opposition to undoing this
blunder, in recent years.
While I don’t have the
space here to dissect their
arguments in detail, they
mostly rely on an implicit
assumption that Faculty
CUs are somehow funda-
mentally Undergraduate
in nature, and that catering
to Postgrads would be a
distraction. I hope that
our present CU leaders
will put this idea aside,
and with a little historical
perspective and a little
boldness, take steps in the
right direction. They will
see how including and
engaging each and every
section of our diverse
Faculty communities,
Undergrad and Postgrad
alike, will reap dividends,
for the benefit of us all.
