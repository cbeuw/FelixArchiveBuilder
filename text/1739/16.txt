Welcome to Fashion
F
ashion – love it or
hate it, everyone’s
talking about it.
And it turns out
we at Felix have plenty to
say on the matter, whether
it be tracking the latest
trends amongst Imperial’s
students, brutally taking
apart the latest met gala
looks, or arguing about
whether culottes have
a place in modern-day
society. In fact, Imperial
College has a wealth of
fashion-centric activities
and talents, from our very
own Fashion and Design
Society to students within
the university who own
their own fashion labels
(yes they exist, what have
you been doing with your
life?). Look no further
than the end of Exhibition
Road and you’ll come
across incredible ex-
hibitions and curated
collections of legendary
designers at the Victoria
and Albert Museum
(currently showcasing
Mary Quant’s work, the
revolutionary who blessed
the Swinging Sixties’girls
with their uniform: mini-
skirts and hot pants).
Given our location in
one of the world’s fashion
capitals, it seemed a real
shame that Felix had aban-
doned its fashion section
for so long. Flicking
through the leather-bound
volumes of all our previ-
ously published issues,
it’s clearer than ever that
what really marked the
progress of time and acted
as a social barometer was
not political leadership
or foreign and domestic
conflicts, but the clothes
we wear and how we wear
them. Empires rise and
fall but from the moment
Eve bit the apple and had
her eyes opened to the
allure of foliage-based
lingerie, clothing has
been humanity’s one true
constant.
Therefore, this year, at
the turn of a new decade,
I’m very excited to
announce the triumphant
return of Felix’s Fashion.
Yes, we understand that
the first issue of the
year has been and gone
but seriously, were you
expecting us to launch
on schedule and not…
fashionably late?
We’ve got interviews
with our Fashion Show
designers, reviews of
campus clothing offer-
ings, and insights into the
fashion industry already
lined up and ready to go.
However, like all revivals
(such as poet sleeves
and, bizarrely, codpieces)
our continued survival
depends on social partic-
ipation so pick up your
pen, Imperial-provided
iPad, or typewriter à
la Tom Hanks and get
involved by submitting
articles to felix@ic.ac.uk
(we’re still setting up our
own email).
Art Adorned: A review
L
ast November,
the auction
house, Christie’s
London, became
home to ‘Art Adorned’ – a
private selling exhibition
with an assemblage of
Old Master Paintings and
renowned luxury fashion
brand Dolce & Gabbana
haute couture creations.
The fusion of these two
arts depicted princesses,
empresses and noblewom-
en as a tribute to feminine
beauty. The designers also
showcased the lasting
influence of art-historical
movements, such as
Renaissance, Baroque and
Rococo, and their timeless
impact on fashion. These
styles flourished in Europe
from the 14th to the 17th
Century and radiate ex-
travagance befitting Dolce
& Gabbana’s celebrated
luxury Italian heritage.
To highlight this, pieces
of Italian furniturewere
also integrated into the
exhibition.
The 2019 Autumn/
Winter collections from
Dolce & Gabbana: Atla
Moda, Alta Sartoria and
Alta Gioielleria, were
displayed alongside devo-
tional paintings with some
pieces of artwork incor-
porated into the fashion
pieces itself. For exam-
ple, Madonna and Child
by Domenica Ghirlandaio
was cross-stitched into the
corset bodice of an Alta
Moda organza dress, the
garment was then com-
pleted with ostrich feath-
ers and velvet piping.
The original painting can
be found in The National
Gallery, Trafalgar Square.
Following this theme,
the exhibition also held a
completely cross-stitched
dress displaying a floral
ensemble and Madonna
del Belvedere by Raphael.
The focal points were
two show-stopping,
hand-painted gowns, one
of which presented a yel-
low and pink floral pattern
on waterfall illusion tulle,
whilst the other with gold
Baroque style motifs ex-
tended onto an elongated
train.
However, the most ex-
travagant item may have
been the Alta Sartoria
green velvet embroidered
single-breasted jacket.
This featured peaked la-
pels, collar and pockets
embellished with a golden
guilloche and a blood jas-
per button. Gold thread,
sequins, pearls and crys-
tals taking inspiration
from the renaissance era
were enlaced in the green
damask item.
Overall, it was a com-
prehensive assortment
construing the embodi-
ment of archetypal fem-
inism in the 14th to 17th
century in Italy. The auc-
tion collection itself is
suitable for high fashion
enthusiasts and the exhi-
bition enabled access for
new and younger audienc-
es to appreciate the works
of art. Although the exhi-
bition is over, the pieces
can still be viewed online
as a virtual tour on Chris-
tie’s website.
