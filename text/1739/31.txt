Imagine a world where all you need to do to stay healthy is eat certain foods - with the new research trend in
hyperfoods, food may someday become the new medicine

“The Imperial

analysed
7962 food
molecules
to discover
nearly 110
potential
candidates
for the fight
against
cancer”
W
ith the
s t e a d y
rise in
average life
expectancy, we are facing
unprecedented levels of
chronic diseases such as
cancer, cardiovascular,
metabolic and neuro-
degenerative disorders.
The lack of available
treatments or definitive
cures for most of these
illnesses has shifted the
public discourse from
therapy and palliative care
to prevention, searching
for ways to avoid such
diseases altogether. As the
single biggest modifiable
aspect of an individual’s
health, diet has become
a major focus for disease
prevention, with research
showing that up to 40% of
cancers can be prevented
by minor nutrition and
lifestyle alterations.
Recent advances in
artificial intelligence tech-
nologies and the growth of
databases on food, drugs
and diseases have made it
possible to identify mole-
cules within food that can
prevent or combat diseas-
es and their symptoms. A
set of such molecules has
already been discovered
by examining structural
similarities between food
molecules and existing
therapeutics. A team
of Imperial College
London researchers
have further developed a
novel machine-learning
strategy to predict can-
cer-beating molecules,
which influence the same
cellular processes targeted
by current clinical ther-
apies. These molecules
regulate cell growth and
inflammation, therefore
suppressing cancer cell
survival, proliferation
and spread. The Imperial
scientists analysed 7962
food molecules to dis-
cover nearly 110 potential
candidates for the fight
against cancer which are
predominantly found in
plant-based foods, such
as tea, carrots, celery,
orange, grape, coriander,
cabbage and dill. Their
machine-learning strategy
is not limited to cancer
research but can also be
used to pinpoint general
health-promoting food
molecules or those appli-
cable to other diseases.
The ultimate goal of
such research is to gen-
erate a database of food
ingredients, rich in dis-
ease-fighting molecules,
that can later be used to
design “hyperfoods”.
Hyperfoods are envisaged
to have health-promoting
or therapeutic effects, to
improve disease treatment
outcomes and decrease
the overall healthcare
burden. They are a mul-
ti-disciplinary endeavour,
requiring not only
scientific and technologi-
cal expertise, but culinary
optimisation (improving
aesthetic features, such
as colour, shape, and
texture, and sensory char-
acteristics, such as taste,
smell, mouthfeel) and
large-scale industrial pro-
duction. Indeed, in 2018
an international group of
academics, chefs and local
food producers signed a
Manifesto on the Future of
Computing & Food with
the aim to revolutionise
the production, distribu-
tion, and consumption
of food. The manifesto
pledges to educate people
about the impact of their
diet on their health and
wellbeing, to enable da-
ta-driven informed food
policy decision making
and to ensure transparency
on the origin and heritage
of food.
Hyperfoods are thus
paving the future to
gastronomic medicine,
an unusual kind of
personalised medicine
with “food passports”
that provide tailored and
therapeutically functional
foods for each individual.
Currently, there are some
obvious limitations to this
preventative approach. It
is unclear whether any of
the identified molecules
are present in sufficient
concentrations within
food items to perform
their proposed health-pro-
moting functions. It also
remains to be established
whether the molecules
can retain their biologi-
cally beneficial properties
through the process of
cultivation, preparation,
cooking and storage. So,
despite structurally re-
sembling drugs or acting
on the same cellular
processes as current ther-
apies, the health effects of
the predicted hyperfoods
are yet to be validated and
quantified.
In that sense, hyper-
foods are quite similar
to the widely popular su-
perfoods. Superfoods
are marketed as nutrient
dense and beneficial
to our health - they are
supposed to be full of
antioxidants to fight off
cancer, healthy fats to
prevent heart disease, and
fibre to keep the digestive
system in check. Popular
superfoods include
blueberries, kale, pome-
granates, goji berries and
chia seeds among others.
There are, however, no set
criteria for determining
what makes food “super”
and there is no scientific
support for the superior
health-promoting effects
of superfoods.
Pomegranates, for
instance, are suggested
to reduce arterial damage
caused by cholesterol and
decrease the progress of
prostate tumours, but the
evidence behind these
claims is either incon-
clusive or incomplete.
Similarly, goji berries
have been used in tradi-
tional Chinese medicine
for thousands of years,
boasting cancer curing
and preventative abilities.

is chia seeds. They are
highly rich in omega-3
fats, which are a staple
of the notoriously healthy
Mediterranean diet.
However, the omega-3s
in chia seeds are disparate
from the health-promoting
omega-3s in fish, and our
bodies are very inefficient
in processing the former
into the latter. While fish
is widely accepted to pro-
tect against heart diseases,
chia seeds have shown no
significant effects with
the regards to risk from
cardiovascular disorders.
Bombarded with su-
perfoods in supermarket
aisles and wellness trends
on social media, we are
more health conscious
today than ever before.
But the high pace of
everyday life is not always
compatible with a healthy
lifestyle – homecooked
5-a-day meals and regular
exercise. So, naturally, we
seek little cheats such as
superfoods - obviously it
is comforting to believe
that eating a kale salad for
lunch or drinking charcoal
shots for breakfast can
help us avoid the horrors
of being chronically or
terminally ill. But, it is
only a small leap from
superfoods to hyperfoods.
As scientists are trying to
identify and extract the
best health-promoting
molecules from all food in
order to create a hyperfood
meal that can alleviate our
health concerns, it appears
that wellness and medi-
cine might finally meet.

From Superfoods to Hyperfoods
However, clinical studies
have failed to validate
the healing properties of
goji berries, and in terms
of nutrients, goji berries
do not outperform other
berries or fruit. Another
case of misleadingly
advertised superfoods
