Felix and Criticism
L
et me just make
one thing clear:
we're absolute-
ly overjoyed
to receive criticism.
Genuinely. We're all in
this because we love what
we do - that's why I, and
every student who works
on this team, puts in 110%
effort pretty much every
week. For the students
especially, who make
up the entire team apart
from myself, this is in
spite of coursework, in
spite of exams, in spite of
everything else that comes
with being an Imperial
College student.
We love what we do.
Even when we're tired and
drained, we all come in to
the office, and put together
a paper every week with
as much diverse and
thoughtful content as we
can muster. There are
litany of obstacles we
face, but we always just
make it work.
Because we love what
we do, we want to get
better. I think everyone at
Imperial can understand
the drive for excellence.
This year's Felix has
produced more content
- by far - than any other
year in at least the last
decade, and possibly ever.
The 96-page anniversary
issue published before
the end of term is far-and-
away the largest (and, I
think, best) issue of Felix
ever. We've all pushed
ourselves to the limit.
So we want to hear
feedback. We want to hear
criticism. That's how we
get better. We don't take it
personally. We've openly
published letters that are
highly critical, even, and I
do my utmost to respond
to every comment or
criticism directed our
way whether publicly or
privately. Many changes
have been implemented
as a result of those, and
we hope that those of
you paying attention have
noticed.
What I want to do in
this editorial is outline
something very impor-
tant, however. There is a
drastic difference between
criticising Felix, and
criticising the students
who put in all that work.
I didn't want to 'toot
our own horn' with the
previous pargagraphs. I
wanted to impress upon
you, the reader, that every
person on this team is a
f*cking legend. I consider
it the highest achievement
of my year, and of my
professional life thus far,
to have built that team,
but it's only been possible
because there are so many
intelligent, passionate,
and hard-working people
at Imperial who also want
to be involved with this
paper. Every writer, every
editor, every copyeditor.
That's why I feel
incredibly defensive of
those people.
Most times, when we
make a mistake, people
are understanding. They
know that we don't have
the resources to output
a completely polished
paper every single time.
We all thank you for that.
We thank you for your
patience with the website,
as well. And typically, for
those who are passionate
about the paper and
offer feedback, I want to
encourage them to join
our little cult - make the
paper better, if a problem
with it is bothering you. If
you feel there's an agenda,
write for the opposite
perspective - we will
accept your article and
work with you. If you see
copy mistakes and it bugs
you, put the effort in and
take the step to becoming
a copyeditor.
Despite all this posi-
tivity, there are a small
minority of people who
have, sadly, become in-
creasingly venomous with
their criticism. They have
stepped over the line from
criticising the paper and
our work, to criticising the
people involved.
I could spend the rest of
this editorial deconstruct-
ing why ad-hominem
attacks are bad, but I think
most people with a grasp
of critical thinking - as
almost everyone here has -
is well-aware of its flaws.
So I won't do that. Instead,
I speak directly to those of
you who launch attacks
against individuals, who
say spiteful things, who
expect something for
nothing, and who are
incapable of even framing
constructive criticism:
everybody on this team is
doing significantly more
for the Imperial commu-
nity than you are. They
are taking a lot of time to
try to create something
fantastic that everyone
can enjoy. They put effort
into their craft, above and
beyond any call of duty or
responsibility you could
even try to lay at their
(volunteering) feet. Have
some respect for them and
the effort they put in, even
if the work they've output
on a particular week isn't
up to the high standards
that we - and you - set for
Felix.
And to be clear, I
exempt myself from this.
This is my job. This edi-
torial isn't me defending
myself - I've got a lot of
areas to improve on, and
as you are all indirectly
paying my salary to do so,
you have every right to be
far more harshly critical
of me than anyone else.
But don't be cruel to
eachother, and don't be
cruel to the best of you
- those who, as I said,
go above and beyond
to contribute back into
the College community,
whether that's via Felix
or in any other way. Treat
eachother with respect,
and remember that the
Felix team are part of the
student cohort as well -
going through the exact
same stresses that lead
you to lash out at them.
