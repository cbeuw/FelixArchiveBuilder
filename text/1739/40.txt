Welcome, all, to another week of puzzles!
Sooo, about last week... Our clues, like most proverbial
elephants in the room, just didn’t quite fit. Nevertheless,
some of you managed to make good progress on the
clues alone or the grid we published on Facebook (Shout-
out to O1G, RIP Pat, and Locky Monsters) and we’ll reward
that with some cheeky points. If you didn’t get a chance,
then look at the silver lining: you get two crosswords this
week.
If you don’t already follow the Felix Facebook page, do so
now. We’ll wait. now. That’s where we’ll post corrections
next time we inevitably screw the pooch.
Enjoy!
