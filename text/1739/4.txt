F
ood service in
the Union bars
and hbar can be
expected “soon-
er rather than later”,
the Deputy President
(Finance and Services)
has said.
The initial plan was
to reopen the kitchens
next week, most likely
on Friday 24th. However,
delays to progress in both
venues means the date is
currently uncertain, with
the potential for further
delays.
The issues – namely
electrical faults and pest
problems – that led to the
initial closure have report-
edly been resolved, with
new equipment addition-
ally being installed in 568.
Additionally, two pizza
ovens will be installed in
hbar pending further dis-
cussions with the College
regarding space usage.
The pizza ovens were
originally bought for
Reynolds, as an upgrade
for the older equipment
there. However, upon pur-
chase it was discovered
that the Reynolds kitchen
could not support them
due to insufficient power
outage.
The reason for the
purchase of unusable
equipment is currently
unclear. The Union’s
Head of Commercial
Services and Operations
Manager did not respond
to multiple requests for
comment sent on 8th and
10th January.
The pizza ovens have,
after having been placed
into storage, found a use
in hbar, where the Union
will be facilitating the
evening service cancelled
by the College last year.
However, the service
return will not see a
reopening of the full
menu in either venue.

Food was due to begin in both venues next week, but delays have set delivery back further; can expect “sooner
rather than later” says DPFS
after a month-long delay

issues with food quality,
is returning in a limited
fashion, predominantly
serving burgers and pizzas
– and the ever-popular
curly fries will also return.
The hbar menu will be
pizzas-only.
The Deputy President
(Finance and Services)
previously stated that
the Union did not want
to bring any “interim”
food measures into hbar,
responding to suggestions
of providing hot dogs
or paninis after initial
negotiations broke down
last summer. Of the new
pizza menu, she said
“the interim services that
could have been provided
quickly would have been
non-inclusive and poor
quality, which is not a
service that I felt the stu-
dents would have wanted,
or something the Union
could have been proud of.
Whilst I will strive for a
fuller menu, a good quality
pizza menu is a step in the
right direction, and can
be made accessible to all
dietary requirements and
preferences.”
There are ongoing con-
cerns about the financial
impact the closure of the
568 kitchens will have on
the Union. In a previous

D
ame Lesley
Regan, Clinical
Professor in the
Department of
Metabolism, Digestion,
and Reproduction, was
made a dame in the New
Year honours list. She
was awarded the pres-
tigious recognition as a
result of decades of work
on women’s health policy
and, from the scientific
direction, reproductive
health.
She also holds several
other positions – she is
co-director of the UK’s
Baby-Bio Bank, a preg-
nancy tissue archive, and
was an academic leader
on developing non-inva-
sive treatments for uterine
fibroids. Both are major
contributors to helping
women experiencing
recurrent miscarriages.
She also sits as the
Head of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology at St. Mary’s
Hospital, was formerly
President of the Royal
College of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology, and is chair
of the International Feder-
ation of Gynaecology and
Obstetrics’(FIGO) Sexual
and Reproductive Rights
Committee, as well as
their General Secretary.
She has repeatedly ad-
vocated for improvements
in science communication
and policy regarding
women’s health. Speaking
to Felix about receiving
the Honour, Dame Lesley
Regan said:
“It is a great privilege
to be recognised in the
2020 New Year Honours
for services to women’s
health. We have made sig-
nificant progress in recog-
nising how important the
health of women is to the
health of our nation. But
there is a long way to go
before we can say that we
have maximised the po-
tential benefits and impact
that we can achieve.
“As President of the
Royal College of Obste-
tricians and Gynaecolo-
gists (RCOG), I wanted
to show politicians and
policymakers that the near
total focus on maternity
care misunderstands the
role of women in society
today. We should no
longer think of women as
characters in a Margaret
Atwood novel whose
sole purpose in life is to
produce children. There
is the whole of the female
life course to consider
and maternity is just one
aspect.
“I want to help create
a society where women
and girls can discuss their
health openly, where they
receive the support they
need to stay healthier for
longer, and where our
decisions and choices
determine the care that
we receive. This is not
wishful thinking - it is
within the grasp of the
government and the NHS
to deliver.
“In December the
RCOG published Better
For Women, a clear
strategy to improve the
lives of girls and women
across the UK. We have
much to do to in order to
achieve the recommen-
dations we set out in this
important report. I look
forward to supporting the
RCOG and its many key
partners to continue to
transform women's health-
care so that everyone in
our society benefits.”
Editor’s note: A
damehood is equivalent
to a knighthood, and
they are issued each New
Year's and in the summer.
It recognises significant
societal contribution
in various forms, and
confers upon one the title
“Dame”.
that the closure would
have “severe budgetary
implications.” Concerns
are heightened after the
discrepancy between the
predictoive budget and
the bars’ actual income
last year forced the Union
to re-evaluate its financial
strategy.
A reforecasting of the
budget takes place in the
Union every January,
and was due Wednesday
January 15th, which
should outline the finan-
cial implications of the
closure. This report was
not provided by the Union
in time for publication.
Felix will report further
on this aspect next week.
