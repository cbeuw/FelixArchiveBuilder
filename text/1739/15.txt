Once: The Musical
The tale of two strangers connected through music
A
dapted from
the 2007 indie
movie of the
same name,
Once first made its stage
debut on Broadway in
2011. For a long time, the
movie has been one of
my all-time favourites -
desperately romantic and
gut-wrenchingly realistic,
all topped up with the
wonderful music written
by Glen Hansard and
Markéta Irglová, who
originally played the lead
roles in the movie.
One of the biggest
debates surrounding
Once, both the movie and
the stage show, has been
whether it is a musical, or
simply a movie (or play in
this case) that happens to
have music in it. Well, it’s
slightly complicated.
Once focuses on two
musicians, simply called
‘Guy’ and ‘Girl’, who
meet at possibly what is
both exactly the right time,
and the worst possible
time for them to meet, and
form a formidable bond
through sharing their
music with one another.
Simply put, the songs are
‘written and performed’
by the character, be it in
pubs, in recording studios,
or just to each other, and
unlike the traditional
musical, are not simply
plot advancement devices.
However, as the songs also
represent the thoughts and
feelings of the characters,
either when they are being
written, or as they are
being performed, they do
a more than adequate job
as a so-called plot device.
And, boy, are the songs
exceptional.
“The real
beauty of the
staging is the
starry sky
overlooking
Dublin”
Cast Recording countless
times. ‘Falling Slowly’,
one of the first songs in
both the play and the
movie, won an Oscar
and was nominated for a
Grammy, which is quite
a feat for an indie movie.
Powerful gems such
as ‘Leave’ and ‘When
Your Mind’s Made Up’,
originally performed by
Glen Hansard, do lose
some of their grit through
some much-expected the-
atricalisation. However,
the new arrangements,
complete with breathtak-
ing build-ups and airtight
harmonies, absolutely
make up for this change in
tone, giving it a new sense
of power. Additionally,
the effective use of the
‘Falling Slowly’ motif
throughout the play is,
although nothing new in
musical theatre history,
executed marvellously,
evoking a sense of love so
hopeless that it hurts.
Carrying the beautiful
tunes written by Hansard
and Irglová are a magnifi-
cent group of musician-ac-
tors who play instruments
on stage, adding to the
cosy, intimate atmosphere
of the set design. The cast
is led by Daniel Healy
and Emma Lucia, who
not only hold their own,
but excel in filling the
large shoes left behind
by Hansard and Irglová,
as well as Steve Kazee
(Tony winner for the role)
and Cristin Milioti (later
rose to prominence as
‘The Mother’ in How I
Met Your Mother), who
originated the roles on
Broadway in 2011.
The set, designed
to resemble a pub
somewhere in Dublin,
is impeccable too. The
show spans many loca-
tions, which are brought
to life by the excellent
and varied use of props.
However, the real beauty
of the staging is the starry
sky overlooking Dublin,
revealed to the audience
as the ceiling of the pub is
lifted and the floor of the
stage lit up to resemble a
nighttime skyline. Czech
surtitles are used to repre-
sent that the characters are
supposed to be speaking in
Czech. At one point in the
play, the surtitles switch
from translating English
to Czech to the other
way around, creating a
subtle yet wildly romantic
moment.
To answer the original
question, Once is neither
and both. Compared to
the movie, which simply
follows the two main
characters’ journeys
through their music, the
stage production definite-
ly has an increased sense
of audience engagement.
This is largely due to
the impeccable musical
arrangements, which hand
over some of the pivotal
songs (such as ‘Gold’) to
the excellent ensemble.
Whether a musical or a
play with music, Once is a
complete marvel, striking
the perfect balance
between fairytale and real
life. Not simply a love
story, it is a story about
life, the power people
have to change it for the
better, and the importance
of right timing for some
things to fall into place,
and others to fall apart.
It is as much a breath of
fresh air now as it was
when the movie first came
out more than a decade
ago. If you somehow
end up wherever Once
is touring for the rest of
the year (and they will
be touring all over the
country), I urge you to
rush to the theatre and
witness it in person, and
support the pure artistry
that has swept me off my
feet time after time, both
on screen and on stage.
