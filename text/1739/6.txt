Crimes?

the best way to do it is.

A
t the moment,
London is
always in the
news, mostly
because of the sheer
amount of knife crime on
the streets of the capital.
Hundreds of almost entire-
ly young men have been
stabbed or have engaged
in the act of stabbing.
This violent act has been
linked to a whole variety
of different causes: drug
crime, a lower number of
police officers, inequality,
and a lack of opportunity.
The finger of blame has
been pointed in so many
different directions that it
is almost certainly dislo-
cated by this point. It is of
course a problem of many
parts, and in this article, I
shall examine some of the
attempts made to dissuade
crime and explain what I
think are the best methods.
First off, I’m going
to (probably incorrectly)
split criminal acts into
two different categories.
Irrational crimes (crimes
of passion), and rational
crimes (premeditated
crimes). Irrational crimes
are crimes that people
commit without putting
too much thought into
the immediate aftermath.
Rational crimes are crimes
that people tend to make
podcasts about 20 years
later and demand a certain
amount of forethought
prior to the commitment
of the crime.
Preventing both types
of these crimes using the
same methodology is not
possible. Irrational crimes
are far more challenging
to prevent, although it is
possible. Rational crimes
however, can be prevent-
ed through deterrence.
Deterrence is compli-
cated. I would propose
that, assuming every
participant is rational,
deterrence is 100% effec-
tive only when there is
no win condition for the
participant that wishes
to perform an act. This
occurs when the conse-
quences of an action are
terrible and also certain,
or terribly certain. To
abstract away from the
individual, let us consider
the main way that peace
was and is maintained in
the modern world. The
Mutually Assured De-
struction (MAD) doctrine
has been a centrepiece of
international diplomacy
since the advent of nuclear
weapons. For two states
considering attacking one
another, there has to be a
motivation, for example,
some territory that they
wish to acquire, and there
has to be a win condition,
where they acquire that
territory at a reasonable
cost. MAD ensures that
there is no such thing as
a reasonable cost for any
goal that a nation wants to
achieve through violence
against a nuclear-armed
nation. The cost is total
and utter destruction.
Some people would
considerdeterrencesimply
to be assured simply from
these consequences alone.
However, this is not the
case at all. Not only is it
necessary to consider the
consequences, but it is
also necessary to consider
the likelihood of these
consequences. In the
MAD doctrine, the only
way to prevent a nuclear
retaliation is through a
first strike, where a nation
destroys the opposition’s
warheads prior to them
being launched. However,
nation states prevent this
by concealing the location
of their warheads. China
hides its nuclear weapons

“Criminal acts
of passion are
impossible to
prevent via
deterrence”
in forests, the UK hides
them in submarines, and
Pakistan hides them in
very dodgy and constantly
moving vans. Therefore,
a devastating retaliation
is impossible to prevent,
hence the lack of a win
condition. This works
well with states since the
actors, governments, are
generally rational. No
state has consciously used
nuclear weapons against
another similarly armed.
From the above, the
lack of a win condition
is a combination of two
factors: an appropriate
consequence that deters
action and the certainty
that this consequence is
guaranteed. These two
factors create deterrence,
preventing rational actors
taking actions that would
be guaranteed to hurt
them at an unacceptable
cost. If we apply this back
to the idea of the individ-
ual committing a crime,
it is clear that this type
of deterrence only works
when the actor considers
the consequences of their
actions and the impact
that it will have on them.
Hence, criminal acts of
passion are impossible to
prevent via deterrence.
When considering the
deterrence of rational
crimes two factors must
be considered: how terri-
fying the punishment is,
or the consequence, and
the likelihood of being
caught, or the probability
that this consequence
occurs. The terrifying
punishment may be
terrifying, but as long as
there is a chance that the
individual is successful
i.e. is not caught, they
may be willing to take
the risk, particularly if the
incentive is large enough.
Therefore, the potential
criminal has a win
condition and therefore
they may take the chance
and commit the crime.
Deterrence has not been
effective. In order to make
the deterrent more effec-
tive, it is necessary to do
one of two things: make
