dependency in the banking
industry meant that heavy
losses were incurred due
to wide exposure. This
was relatively micro-
scopic. Now the reader
should understand why it
took so long for France to
re-establish itself on the
right track. At last, what
can the French people do?
Nothing. History has told
time and time again that
the ordinary middle class
is to be held accountable
for economic failures on
a national scale. They
have the most to lose. It
was the case in 1930 and
2008 in the United States,
in 1991 in Japan, and in
1994 in South Korea. Will
corporate conglomerates
cease to exist? No. They
will survive and thrive,
perhaps under the guise of
national bailouts. Eventu-
ally, all of this will be paid
for. Unless deep structural
changes occur for the next
decade, French troubles
are far from over.

speciﬁes reference values

EU Member States: 3%
of gross domestic product
(GDP) for the government

for government debt (the
Maastricht criteria).
