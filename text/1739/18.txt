S
at in the group
study area
overlooking the
library café, I saw
someone go by wearing
a hoodie with a large
American Express logo
on the back. My immedi-
ate thought was that this
was a designer hoodie
employing a trendy but
also ironic logo, the likes
of which Balenciaga
and many others have
ridden to the top over the
course of the last decade.
Balenciaga’s Creative
Director Demna Gvasalia
even went as far to play
on the Mastercard logo
for their SS20 collection,
perhaps as a comment on
consumerism in the indus-
try, more likely because
the Mastercard logo is
instantly recognisable. A
closer look at the hoodie
in the cafe revealed that
I was sadly mistaken as
the hoodie was from a
conference sponsored by
the credit card company.
If the 2010’s, especially
the late 2010’s, are to
be remembered for any
single trend, it must be
logomania. Instantly
Michelle’s resurrection of
Gucci or Virgil Abloh’s
meteoric rise at the helm
of Off-White. The last
decade has been all about
telling everyone, in no
subtle way, who you are
wearing.
Rather than focusing
on distinctive silhouettes
which have defined
designers throughout
the history of fashion,
designers over the last
ten years have become
dependent on instantly
recognisable logos for
fear of being forgotten
about at fashion week or
worse, scrolled past on
social media. Instagram’s
impact on fashion has
been widely reported, and
the rapid turn to relying
on logos is butone feature.
Logos meant likes, likes
meant increased reach,
and increased reach
ultimately means more
money for Bernard
Arnault and his designers.
For any designer to reach
the upper echelons in the
2010’s, creative use of
prints and collaborations
were paramount along
with, of course, crafty use
of “Instagram influenc-
ers”.
Instagram has been
trialling the removal of
visible likes from the
platform throughout
2019. If the platform is to
remove likes completely
from the platform in 2020,
we could see a paradigm
shift in fashion design
and marketing, unleashed
from the shackles of
scrolling. Removing
visible like counts would
encourage creative
content to be appreciated
for what it is, not its
number of double-taps.
This is a shift so great
that Instagram’s decision
could dictate future trends
more so than any single
brand or collection this
year. The most dramatic
change could be one of
consumers looking en
masse for trends outside
of Instagram completely,
relying on new sources of
information and perhaps
returning to traditional
forms of fashion journal-
ism.
and, in recent years, I
have clung to designers
like Iris Van Herpen for
hope of something more
in fashion’s future (who
I highly suggest looking
up if you have not seen
her work). Popularity of
these collections seem
impossible at the moment
for their expense and the
sustained attention they
require for consumers.
The end of likes and the
subsequent change of
attitude on social media
could enable a new gen-
eration of designers to
explore complex, nuanced
designs once again
without the demand of
every collection needing
a logo t-shirt and hoodie
to be successful. On the
other hand, Instagram
removing likes might
allow TikTok to take
its place as the fashion
marketing social media. If
that is the case, I am sorry
in advance.
Instagram’s removal of visible likes could be the fashion moment of 2020
Iconic, ironic or plain moronic? // Instagram @teeharbi
“Logos

money”
recognisable monograms
and name-brand prints
dominated runways,
whether it was Alessandro
“In recent
years, I have
clung to

Iris Van Herpen
for hope of
something
more in
fashion’s
future”
Make no mistake - I
have loved the irony
and tongue-in-cheek of
logomania, and I am
undoubtedly addicted to
Instagram. However, I
deeply miss the ambitious
and daring collections
of the decade before last
from the likes of McQueen
