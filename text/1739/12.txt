The Power: A Novel with Powerful Ideas that Fails to
Execute Them
The Power is a book with enormous potential, but it fails to effectively capitalise on them with any nuance - and
instead hammers home a staler, less original IDEA

I
feel quite torn about
The Power.
On the one hand, I
think the frank - even
brutal - portrayal of the
consequences of physical
power is to be admired.
There’s something to be
said for the fearless bleak-
ness required to write
those scenes; scenes of
rape, abuse, torture, on the
individual and systemic
level. The book doesn’t
shy away from the horror
of the situations it is pre-
senting. It also provides
a somewhat refreshing
view of power dynamics,
moving away from certain
modern popular views
that tend to boil down to
“men bad, women good”.
On the other, that re-
freshing viewpoint is also
the source of the novel’s
weaknesses. Simply put,
the concept was not as
fully explored as I would
have liked.
Yes, some of the
insights into the way that
physical power propagates
into social power and the
oppression of the power-
less were quite insightful.
The acknowledgement
that being powerless can,
in controlled situations,
be an attractive or enticing
thing (especially for those
previously used to power)
was one I didn’t expect to
find. How many authors
dare to write about men
enjoying being submis-
sive in bed, for fear of
drawing ire from the
depressingly fragile egos
of the Chads of the world?
And yes, it successfully
communicates the old
adage “power corrupts,
and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.” But I
also feel that it fails to go
any further, which is what
I was expecting given the
high praise friends and
family have heaped upon
this book.
The essential idea
of the novel is that our
world’s historical abuse of
women is a product of the
physical power men tend
to have, which results in
social power, and not a
product of something like
biological differences in
the brain, such as levels
of testosterone. In other
words, it does not matter
which gender is the more
‘powerful’, in the sense
that it wouldn’t stop
abuses of power. When
women suddenly develop
‘skeins’ which allow them
“It could have
been explored
deftly,
focussing on
differences
rather than
similarities to
our world”
to discharge electricity
severe enough to main or
kill, world history and the
patriarchy is upended.
The consequences of
this shift are speculated
upon, and conclude that
women having the power
to rape and pillage, or to
launch nukes in signs of
aggression, or whatever
else would result in just
as horrific a world as our
real one - one in which
men tend to have that
power. The idea, then, is
that gender is essentially
purelyaconstructofpower
dynamics; the stereotypes
that are associated with
genders are originated
from the difference in
physical power between
genders; and removing
power differences results
in no need for the gender
construct.
Great. I can get behind
all that.
However, I feel like all
of this could have been
explored more deftly, with
more thought dedicated to
the differences that might
exist in this new hypo-
thetical world - one in
which women only gained
physical power after
having been oppressed for
millennia - rather than the
similarities. Because I do
genuinely believe there
would be differences - not
because women are better
than men, but because
anybody who has been
subjugated would be fully
aware of what they were
doing by abusing their
power. That situation is
blatantly not the same
as the world we live in,
where the privilege of men
is there because they have
always had the advantage
of that physical power.
There are multiple
ways this could play out.
The urge for revenge
could drive greater
atrocities. The oppressed
could empathise and rise
above those desires. Any
number of other interest-
ing possibilities present
themselves. However, The
Power, in seeking to make
its point about genders as
a social construct, wastes
this chance. It deliberately
portrays a world virtually
identical to our own, just
with the genders reversed;
the end of the novel
features an ‘epilogue’ of
sorts, thousands of years
later, where a male writer
is advised to use a female
pen-name instead.
As a result, the novel
very much starts to read as
“hey you know how men
do this to women in our
world? well women would
also do that to men in this
world! Power corrupts,
guys!” I understand that,
to an extent, that is the
point being made by the
novel - but I think, then,
that the point should have
been changed, or rather
developed further. Indeed,
it starts to feel a little
‘Animal Farm’ in how
‘on the nose’ it is. Animal
Farm is great, don’t get
me wrong, but there’s a
reason it’s not considered
a masterpiece quite on
the level of 1984. The
Power ends up being just
interesting, at many points
brutal and raw in a way
that deserves commenda-
tion and respect, and with
the potential be a powerful
novel for disabusing the
un- or mis-informed about
the nature of power as
it relates to gender. I’ve
found myself using it as an
example in conversation,
in an attempt to illustrate
certain points, and that
speaks for itself.
However, it sacrifices
subtlety and nuance in
order to ring those par-
ticular notes as strongly
as it does, pounding the
message in with a mallet,
and in doing so can
come across - despite the
darkness of some of its
contents - almost naive in
its interpretation. It will
not change the landscape
of political or social com-
mentary for any informed
reader, as I feel it had the
potential to do.
