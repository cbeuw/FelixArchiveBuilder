Mary Quant - An Introduction

M
ary Quant
was born in
1934, the
daughter of
Welsh school-teachers
from mining families that
aspired for her to follow
their path and become a
grammar-school teacher.
Instead she opened her
own clothes shop in
King’s Road with the help
of her husband and busi-
ness partner, Alexander
Plunket Greene, whom
she met at Goldsmiths
College, and photogra-
pher Archie McNair. Her
radical designs provided
a personal means for
other girls to break away
from their parents and to
stop dressing like their
mothers. In 1966 she
received the Order of
the British Empire ‘for
jolting England out of
its conventional attitude
towards clothes’.
The 1960s in Britain
was a decade of massive
societal change. Women
campaigned for equal pay
and it became illegal for
employers to discriminate
against women. The
greater availability of jobs
allowed them to become
more independent at a
time when most women
couldn’t open a bank
account without a male
relative’s permission,
enabling them to imagine
a life that went beyond
the centre of fashion
during les années folles.
However, clothes by
designers like Paul Poiret
and Coco Chanel were
only accessible to a small
elitist clientele who could
afford couture.
Mary Quant embodied
a similar shift towards a
new era of femininity in
post-war 1960s Britain but
she democratised fashion
by making clothes more
financially accessible to
working girls. She was
radical because instead
of slavishly copying
the designs of Parisian
fashion houses to be sold
to British retailers, she
decided that street clothes
deserved to have their own
designs. It worked to her
advantage that she studied
Art at Goldsmiths and
not Fashion, her lack of
formal training allowing
her to rethink design
from scratch and imple-
ment her own creative
vision of what women’s
clothing should be like
(“optimistic, exuberant,
young, flirty”), capturing
the mood of the time and
giving an outward expres-
sion to women’s greater
freedoms by creating
clothes that were comfort-
able and enabled ease of
imaginative and original,
borrowing pinstriped
shirts from men’s designs,
pinafores and peter-pan
collars from children’s
clothes and prominently
visible buttons and zippers
from industrial uniforms.
Her most iconic
contribution, symbolic
of women’s growing
autonomy over their
own bodies, was the
popularisation of the
miniskirt - a garment that
is to this day controversial
in many countries and
which remains a symbol
of defiance and sexual
empowerment in the Me
Too era. Sixty years on,
wearing a miniskirt can
still feel like a rebellious
act.
Mary Quant’s designs
are currently exhibited
at the V&A until the 16
February.

Fifty-three years ago from
2020, the invention of the
contraceptive pill had a
transformative effect on
gender relations, creating
a stark contrast between
the teenagers of the 60s
and their parents’ genera-
tion.

in fashion. The loosening
