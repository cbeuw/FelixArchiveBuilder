Keir Starmer is Labour’s best hope

T
he race is on
for Labour to
select its leader
to shadow the
Conservatives’ over-
whelming majority over
the next five years, and
(if nothing goes wrong)
to lead the party into the
next General Election.
Following the most
humiliating electoral
defeat since 1935, it’s
time for Labour to reflect
on itself, a process that
both frontbenchers and
ordinary supporters must
go through.
Many have attributed
the failure solely to
Brexit, with the narrative
going like “Labour lost
the election because of
its weak Brexit stance
despite the good economic
policies”. The fallacy is
falling to recognise that
both Labour’s Brexit and
economic policies were
unconvincing, and these
two factors were resonat-
ing together to curate the
failure. Many Remain
voters are not fond of
radical plans such as
mass nationalisation, and
despite the media urges
on tactical voting, these
voters simply cannot
tolerate Corbyn’s Labour
and turned to the Liberal
Democrats instead.
That’s why Labour
needs to elect a leader
who can uphold the funda-
mental principles Labour
stands for; to protect the
rights and services for
everyone in the country
and Britons abroad – from
fundamental human rights
to the NHS; to address
and end the climate crisis;
to promote equality and
widen the path to social
upheaval for the working
class. At the same time
Labour needs to recon-
sider its economic stance,
which was, frankly,
self-marginalising and
dissuading. By moving
back to the centre ground,
Labour will stop its
descent into a party for
only Londoners, activists
and uni students, but
remain as a broad church
with a moderate and
realistic set of economic
policies for a dynamic
economy with – as the
constitution itself puts it
– a thriving private sector
and high-quality public
services.
And Starmer is the right
person for the job.
Despitebeingamember
of the shadow cabinet,
Starmer kept a distance
between himself and
Corbynism. Most notably
he abstained, instead of
opposed, the Welfare
Reform Bill introduced
by the Conservative gov-
ernment in 2016. In the
leadership election that
same year, he pitched his
support to Corbyn’s rival
Owen Smith, a centrist
candidate. But at the same
time he isn’t a vocal critic
of Corbyn and the “old
Labour” trade unionism,
for he has been voluntar-
ily providing free legal
advice and representations
to trade unionists since the
Thatcher era.
Keir Starmer started
off his career as a human
rights barrister. He worked
extensively on a pro bono
basis, representing many
who couldn’t afford legal
representation in human
right cases. This has con-
tinued after he obtained
the honour of appoint-
ment as Queen’s Counsel.
He then worked as legal
and policy adviser to the
Northern Ireland police
and the government. From
2008 to 2013 he served
as the head of the Crown
Prosecution Service. He is
also a barrister for Human
Dignity Trust, a charity
aiming to defend LGBT
rights throughout the
Commonwealth through
legal means.
He stood opposed to
many policies of the Blair
government, believing it
has strayed too far from
Labour values. In 2003 he
voiced that he believes the
legal advice Blair relied
on for the invasion of
Iraq was flawed – a stance
later confirmed in the Iraq
Inquiry in 2016.
protesters. He is also on
board with the Green New
Deal, pledging for a green
industrial revolution to
decarbonise the economy.
Starmer devoted his
maiden speech in the
House of Commons to de-
fending the Human Rights
Act 1998, an Act the Con-
servative Party has long
been pledging to repeal. It
is the only comprehensive
human rights legislation
in our statue and the only
domestic legal protection
British residents have
against violations of
human rights.
With the Tories holding
a majority of 80, the
government could blaze
any bill through the Par-
liament with ease. The
country needs a strong
and effective opposition
to hold the government
to account, especially on
matters of human right
and the climate crisis.
Among the contenders,
Starmer stands out the
most with his strong, con-
tinuous history of sticking
to Labour’s principles;
fighting for the many and
the ordinaries against the
few and the powerful, and
sometimes the state. At
the same time – perhaps
a trait more appealing to
the middle-class voters
in contrast to Corbyn, he
is not a revolutionist to
upset the system – for he
was the Director of Public
Prosecutions and has
worked for several police
forces – a very “prime
ministerial” appearance.
It’s not hard to explain
why he is the frontrunner
in the leadership race,
and rightfully so. He is
the natural choice for a
modern and electorally
capable Labour party.

In 1995, when Shell
attempted to dispose
an offshore oil storage
platform into the ocean,
Starmer joined Green-
peace to stop an ecologi-
cal disaster. He fought for
10 years in the McLibel
case, when McDonald
sued two environmental
activists for libel for
sending out leaflets on the
street. Recently he has ex-
pressed support towards
Extinction Rebellion
“That’s why
Labour needs
to elect a
leader who can
uphold their
fundamental
principles”
