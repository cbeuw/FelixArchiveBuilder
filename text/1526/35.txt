This week you decide that
heroin is for you. Turns out
it’s just a teeny bit moreish,
much like a second choco-
late Hobnob with that nice
cup of tea. Before you know
it your student loan is gone.
You just can’t get any work
done and can’t do handle a
tough degree. You transfer to
Kings and get a first.
This week you give in and
just resign yourself to the
fact that you just can’t get
good grades without per-
forming cunnilingus on a
lecturer. Gasping for air, and
mouthwash, you are sure
that you’ve secured yourself
a solid 2:1. You fail. Your lec-
turer says he “has integrity”.
Meh. It was worth a shot.
This week you decide that Im-
perial is just all too much. Just
like that, you drop out and go
to UCL. You have wild nights
and no lectures, an amazing
university experience. Two
years on and you’re still un-
employed. Could be worse,
you could still have no luck
with the opposite sex. Oh
wait, you do. Sucks.
This week you just can’t
shake off the feeling that
you’re being watched. Gasp-
ing for breath, you see a de-
mented clown saying. “FUCK
YOU” you scream as you
knee him in the balls. Turns
out you were sleepwalking,
that was a demonstrator in
labs, and you have an awk-
ward viva coming up. Pint?
This week you seduce a
student. Awww yeah, this is
amazing. You’re the sexy lec-
turer that everyone wants and
no-one can resist. Wait, they
just wanted higher marks.
Typical Imperial students.
Weeping, you give them a
low mark. Oh well. There’s al-
ways masturbation. You be-
come impotent. Damn.
This week, you’ve finally
done enough stretching to
make self-sucking a reality.
The taste of your parts in your
mouth are undeniably sweet,
and salty, and oh sooo bliss-
ful. You come uncontrollably
and screaming at the top of
your voice. Tip for next time:
don’t do it in the changing
rooms in Ethos. Pervert.
This week you watch a cou-
ple getting in on in the Li-
brary. HOT STUFF. You furi-
ously finish yourself off while
they writhe with pleasure.
“Erm, hi, erm, can I return
this book please” someone
says to you at your desk. You
immediately shush them and
point to the self return ma-
chines.
This week you try to be a nud-
ist. Except for the odd oil from
a pan spitting incident it goes
pretty well. One thing though:
people seem to be avoiding
sitting on the same seats as
you. Two words: toilet paper.
Stop walking brown if you’re
all on show. You finally catch
Freshers’ Flu and decide to
wear clothes.
This week you are perfect in
every way. All people want to
be your friend. Everyone is
eyefucking you 24/7. You get
firsts on everything and wake
up at 6am with no hangover
after a big night out, during
which you had many suc-
cessful rendezvous. What?
Can’t these be positive once
in a while?
This week you’re David Cam-
eron. You start tweeting. This
is amazing. The crowds of
plebs will show you how they
admire, respect, adore, almost
worship, you. You look at your
mentions. Oh well. You call in
Nick Clegg and tell him to get
on his knees or you won’t let
him in cabinet meetings any-
more. Mmmm. All better.
This week, you’re Nick Clegg.
You Google your name. You
immediately decide to never
use the internet again. Your
phone rings. “BITCHBOY,
GET IN HERE NOW. MY
BIG SOCIETY WON’T LICK
ITSELF YOU KNOW”. Fuck.
Your knees had just recov-
ered. You put on your pink
tutu.
This week, you transform in to
Ashley Cole. You start tweet-
ing about everything. You
use some choice hashtags.
Oooooooooooooooooooops.
Oh well. Things could be
worse for you: you could be
Nick Clegg. You deliriously
wake up from your sleep and
realise you are Nick Clegg,
and your phone’s ringing.
