Crossword
Somewhere across the vast ocean, there exists a peculiar island, the Island of Knights and Knaves.
Its inhabitants are, of course, Knights, who always tell the truth, and Knaves, who always lie.
A horse has been stolen on the island, and three inhabitants, Andrew, Bartholomew, and Curtis,
are brought to testify. The following exchange takes place:
Judge: Andrew, did you steal the horse?
Andrew: No, Your Honour.
Bartholomew: Liar! You’re lying!
Andrew: No, I’m not!
Curtis: Shut up! Both of you are lying! Your Honour, Andrew’s the thief!
Andrew: One final remark, Your Honour. The day before the theft, I overheard Bart and Curtis
talking amongst themselves. They both admitted to stealing the horse!
Whom should the judge convict?
Knights and Knaves

Rising from the ashes, the invincible Slitherlink
makes a triumphant return to the hallowed pages
of Felix Puzzles. A new year means all new chances
to be foiled by its fiendish traps and challenges.
Dare you proceed?
Your aim is to tomakeonecontinuousclosedloop
by connecting the dots. The numbers in each square
indicate how many edges of the square are part of
the loop, so if it contains a “2”, you know that two
and only two out of four edges have lines. That’s
all the info you need to get the one logical answer
(though waiting a week to see the solution will also
do).
Answers, as ever, to puzzles.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. Back in my day, you had to scan this kind of
thing over. Now everyone’s got these new fangled
smartphones. Ridiculous.
Just like last week, insert a
digit from 1 to 9 into all of the
white cells, so that the total of
each row or column adds up
to the corresponding number
in the grey cells. But hold your
horses homeslice! Each row
or column cannot featuring
repeatingdigits.
