Short Stories
of the Week
Missing Women
After being accused of spying on
employees in France, Ikea has issued
an apology concerning its catalogue
available in Saudi Arabia. In the Saudi
version of the catalogue, women
have been airbrushed out of pictures,
including a woman standing in
her pyjamas and an Ikea designer.
Members of the Swedish government
in particular were very critical of the
multinational group, stating that
companies should not abandon their
values abroad. Saudi Arabia has been
in the spotlight for women’s rights
(or lack thereof), as women do not
yet have the right to vote, and it is
the only country in the world where
women are not allowed to drive.
Synchronised Toilet Flush
Citizens of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe,
have been asked to participate in a
synchronised toilet flush. The aim is
to prevent blockage of sewage pipes
by keeping them wet. This has been
difficult due to a prolonged drought
and water shortages. Authorities
have warned that residents who fail
to flush their toilet at the designated
time and date will risk being fined.
The first flush took place at 17:30
GMT, 24th September 2012. Two
synchronised toilet flushes have been
scheduled every week from now on.
Train Wreck
The Department for Transport has
gone back on its decision of giving
FirstGroup the west coast mainline
contract. When the contract was
awarded during the summer, it was
metwithcriesofprotestfromRichard
Branson and Virgin, the west coast’s
current operator. Branson claimed
FirstGroup’s bid was unreasonably
high and service quality would
deteriorateorleadtoasimilarcrisisas
that of the east coast mainline, which
was subsequently nationalised. The
decision was finally scrapped last
week by the government, explained
by flaws in the bidding process and
calculation mistakes. The blame
has been placed on civil servants,
including three who have been
suspended. The government is now
faced with two difficult challenges.
The bidding process has been shown
to be complicated and flawed, it will
most likely need to be abandoned or
reformed. In addition, Virgin Trains’
contract ends on 9th December; the
route will have to be nationalised or
an agreement will have to be reached
with Virgin until a new bidding
process can go through. The blunder
has cost taxpayers £40million and is
estimated to cost another £75million
for every year the new contract is
delayed. FirstGroup has stated it is
considering legal action.

Miliband’s Makeover
After his party address and mastering of the skill of repetition (“One Nation” - 46 times), the
Labour leader is hoping to boost his election chances. Matthew Proctor looks into them.
d Miliband is on a high: his
party has a 14 point lead over
Cameron’s Conservative
party (YouGov/The Sun)
who are themselves suﬀering from
somewhat of a crisis of identity as
Cameron struggles to ﬁnd policies
that will impress his right-wing
backbenchers but will still keep
his Lib Dem colleagues satisﬁed in
government.
The Conservatives are struggling
then, but, is it possible for Miliband to
win the next election? His election to
leader of the party brought widespread
criticism from some in the party who
believed that his brother, David, was
the more conﬁdent character and was
therefore more suited to the job. To
some, David represented a new-era
Tony Blair who would take the Labour
Party back to 1997 levels of support.
However, the votes of the unions for
Ed Miliband eventually meant that he
was voted in.
Miliband is still thought of as a bit
of an awkward character who can’t
really be seen to be a true leader.
It was therefore important that he
made a strong impression at his party
conference last week. He had to make
sure of three things:
A New Image
Ed took to the stage without notes,
echoing what Cameron has done time
and time again, and began to speak
conﬁdently, casually joking along.
He had strong presence on the stage,
moving around and making himself
seen. Comparing this speech to his
2010 inaugural speech as Leader
of the Opposition, the changes are
profound: from a bumbling man
behind a podium to an assured man
commanding his audience. This was a
new Ed Miliband, a true leader. That’s
the ﬁrst point ticked oﬀ.
A party with real policies?
Unfortunately, his speech was rather
lacking in this department. Miliband
mainly talked about his own life and
his upbringing — making sure to
explicitly mention, multiple times,
that he went to a comprehensive
school and that he was born in a
National Health Service hospital.
This kind of spiel of course excited
the strong left-wing crowd, but it did
little to allay voters’ fears that the
Labour party were simply a party to
criticise the Coalition’s policies while
continuing without a clear policy
plan themselves. Miliband also piped
on once again about “dealing with
the banks” but failed to say how he
planned on doing so.
A party of the people?
Miliband talked of a “One Nation”
Labour. This harks back to Disraeli,
a Conservative politician and Prime
Minister from 1874 to 1880. It was
a bold move from Miliband. “He
(Disraeli) was a Tory… but don’t
let that put you oﬀ!” he joked. He
praised Disraeli’s vision of a country
coming together to defeat fascism
— Miliband presented his vision of
a Britain coming together today to
rebuild the country after high levels
of unemployment, a widening gap
between rich and poor, and a general
view that meritocracy has gone out of
the window. It was a clever hijacking of
a traditional Tory ideal and an attempt
from Miliband to claw back the voters
he’d lost at the 2010 election — the
middle-class, centre-ground men and
women who had lost faith in Labour
during the economic collapse in 2008.
Miliband wanted to ﬁnish the idea of
New Labour without going back to
“old Labour.”
So that’s two out of three overall. Not
a bad show from the Labour leader. In
fact, YouGov polls showed that after
the conference, conﬁdence in whether
Ed could become PM rose by 6 points.
However, there’s still a widespread
view that, currently, Cameron is
better oﬀ as PM. We’ll have to wait
and see how the Conservative party
conference turns out before we can
clearly say how well Ed Miliband has
done. However, with Cameron ﬁnding
it hard to keep his backbenchers
happy and Osborne losing grip on
the economy, it’s hard to see how
Cameron can turn the polls around to
a clear Tory victory in 2015.
If they aren’t victorious, it seems
increasingly likely that Cameron will
be ousted. Will this mean a return
to the House of Commons for Boris
Johnson? Probably not, with more
right-wing characters such as Michael
Gove and Liam Fox impressing
backbenchers and Boris in the
mayoral oﬃce until 2016. Boris fans
will likely be disappointed come the
next Parliament.
Abortion debate resurfaces
One of the central features of David
Cameron’s reinvention of the Conserv-
ative party going in to the 2010 election
was the pull to the centre; dressed in
the vocabulary of the Big Society and
Green Conservatism, they sought to
shed the old-fashioned, right-wing im-
age. ‘Backbench’ MPs may have been
unhappy, but the promise of govern-
ment and a Tory majority kept them at
bay.
However, that majority resolutely
failed to materialise, and so began
the struggle between Cameron and
his backbenchers that seems to have
deﬁned the Conservative’s period in
coalition. Indeed, one of the ﬁrst things
Cameron did after becoming Prime
Minister was to hammer through a
vote allowing cabinet MPs to sit on
meetings of the 1922 Committee, a
group of backbenchers that has the
power to unseat a Tory leader.
In this way we can interpret the
Tories’continualjerkstotherightasthe
inevitable result of continual inﬁghting,
withCameronswervingbetweendirect
conﬂict with his backbenchers, such
as the unprecedented rebellion over
Lord’s reform, and attempts to placate
them such as continual discussion
about an EU referendum and the
recent Cabinet reshuﬄe.
The recent furore over
Jeremy Hunt’s declaration
of support for a reduction in
the 24-week abortion time
limit is a good example of
the continual push and pull
between the centre and the
right. Hunt’s position,
unchanged since
the 2008 vote,
which kept the time-limit at 24 weeks,
appeals strongly to the more hardline
voices in the back benches.
As Health Secretary, Hunt’s role
requires evidence based decisions
and, simply put, the evidence is
entirely against him; survival rates
below 24 weeks have not improved
substantially, and both the British
Medical Association and the
Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists advise holding the limit
at 24. Yet, by virtue of his position,
his reaﬃrmation takes on more
weight than the similar remarks
made by Theresa May and
Equalities Minister Maria Miller
last week.
But David Cameron has stated
quite plainly that the Tories
have no plans to
table another
vote on the issue
of abortion. So why all the noise?
Looking at the events with the context
of inﬁghting, it seems that Number 10
sought to reassure hardline Tories with
a reminder that the Cabinet still sits
to the right, in order to dampen the
potential rebellion over the upcoming
debate on gay marriage.
Looking at the speeches from the
Conservative Party Conference this
week, the language of the ‘centre’
seems to have disappeared entirely.
Despite Cameron’s appeal that “The
Conservative party is for everyone”
and refusal to stop talking about the
invisible Big Society, his aides insist
that the common ground in politics
sits with them, well right of centre.
Number 10, it seems, sides with the
backbenchers, but it’s taken two and
a half years of pulling on their part
for Cameron to let slip the mask of
centrism.
“Why, Ed, why?”
Nick made a “One Nation”
speech back in March.
Not that anyone noticed.
