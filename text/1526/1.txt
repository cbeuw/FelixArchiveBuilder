Con man near campus takes student’s money
Last Thursday 4 October at around
10:30am, a student at Imperial College
London has had £70 taken by a conﬁ-
dence trickster.
The student, who wished to not be
named, was approached by a man on
the corner of Queen’s Gate Place. The
man, who was on the phone at the
time, asked if the student knew the
area. The man was described by the
student as middle-aged with white/
dark hair, is in his 40s, and was well
dressed. The man reportedly also
spoke in an American accent and told
the student that his car was impound-
ed on Cromwell Road. The student
pointed him in the right direction,
but the American man insisted that
they take minicab to the car pound,
and paid the driver £15 upfront. The
American man regaled the student
with information to implicitly suggest
that he was to be trusted; one such
piece of information was that he was
in the US Marine Corps.
The American man then wanted
the student to pay for the car to be
released, claiming that his credit card
was not working. The student was
promised that he would receive an
iPod or double the amount of money
asked. The student said that at this
point “I tried to hide my surprise at
the rapidly deteriorating situation,
and said I didn’t want to proﬁt, I just
wanted to help him.” The student
withdrew £70 to
give to the man,
saying that “by this
stage... the loss of
£70 was probably

Babar Ahmad has been extradited to
the United States after the High Court
refused to review his case. Last month,
the European Court of Human Rights
(ECHR) gave its ﬁnal approval for the
extradition. At a federal district court
hearing in New Haven, Connecticut,
Babar Ahmad pleaded not guilty and
is currently in custody.
Mr Ahmad has been held in prison
in the UK for eight years without trial.
He was arrested in 2004, imprisoned
under the Extradition Act 2003, and
has been detained ever since. He had
been arrested due to allegations that
he was involved in terrorist activity
through a website hosted in America.
Babar Ahmad’s brother-in-law Fa-
had Ahmad read a statement on his
behalf, in which he said, “Today I have
lost my 8 year and 2 month battle
against extradition to the US. I would
like to thank all those over the years
who supported me and my family:
lawyers, politicians, journalists and
members of the public from all walks
of life. By exposing the fallacy of the
UK’s extradition arrangements with
the US, I leave with my head held high
having won the moral victory”.
A last minute appeal for a judicial
review at the British High Court was
denied on 5th October and Babar Ah-
mad was immediately extradited that
evening to the United States. The Eu-
ropean Court of Human’s rights ruled
that there would be “no violation of
the applicants” rights if they were to
be extradited for a trial in America
and therefore rejected a request for
the referral of Babar Ahmad’s case to
the Grand Chamber.
Babar Ahmad’s father, Ashfaq Ah-
mad, who was extremely disappointed
over the High Court’s refusal of the
judicial review, said, “After over 40
years of paying taxes in this country,
I am appalled that the system has let
me down in a manner more beﬁtting
of a third world country than one of
the world’s old-
est democracies…
