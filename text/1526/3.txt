Constitution changes to be discusssed
In the ﬁrst Council of the academic
year, changes to the constitution,
which were put forward by Paul Beau-
mont, Union President, were agreed
to in principle. A period of consulta-
tion is now expected to begin. Beau-
mont said that he was going to be talk-
ing to people about it and explaining
the changes.
It is expected that the ﬁnal docu-
ment, with any changes made to the
current one available, will be made
public twelve days before Council
meets to vote on it.
Last year, the Union President at the
time, Scott Heath, proposed changes
to the Consitution, which is eﬀectively
the set of guidelines that decides how
the Union is structured and governed.
The changes proposed this time
around are diﬀerent do not include
the Deputy President (Finance & Ser-
vices) no longer being a position.
The Representation & Welfare
Board (RWB) would be split into two
in the changes. These would be the
Education & Representation Board,
where oﬃcers who are dealing with
representation would sit, and the
Communities & Welfare Board, where
welfare oﬃcers would sit.
The composition of Executive Com-
mittee has also been proposed to
be changed. This would include the
President as the Chair (as before), the
Deputy Presidents, the Constituent
Union Presidents, and four members
of Council; this would be instead of
the members of the CSB and FWB.
The Executive Committee, which cur-
rently deals with the day-to-day run-
ning of the Union and not the policy
direction, would remain in that role.
It would, however, be able to approve
expenditure of up to £100,000 and not
£500,000 as before. This was justiﬁed
with the reason being that only one or
two events ever get to that much.
In the new Constitution, Court will
no longer exist with its roles shifted to
sub-committee of the Trustee Board.
The changes propose that the Trus-
tee Board is changed in makeup. The
new Board would be the President,
Council Chair, all of the Deputy Presi-
dents (Education, Welfare, Finance &
Services, and Clubs & Societies), and
two elected Student Trustees. The

FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER

the court have colluded to implement
a pre-determined decision which was
made in Washington. We will never
abandon our struggle for justice and
the truth will eventually emerge of
what will be forever remembered as
a shameful chapter in the history of
Britain”.
Shadow Justice Minister, and Toot-
ing MP, Sadiq Khan, said: “The way
criminal cases work in America
means that defendants facing a trial
are advised to plea bargain. It is a big
risk pleading ‘Not Guilty’. My under-
standing is that the consequences of
this include the threat of life in solitary
conﬁnement without parole, should
they lose a trial. If those are the stakes
which pleading ‘Not Guilty’ involve
then it is no wonder that over 97 per
cent of defendants accept a plea bar-
gain – regardless of how conﬁdent or
determined they are to stand trial”
A British Businessman and anti-
extradition campaigner Karl Watkin
tried to call for a private prosecution
in the UK. The Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP), Kier Starmer QC,
rejected his proposal. Mr Starmer re-
leased a statement that said Mr Wat-
kin’s documents were “very short, lack
any meaningful detail and do not pro-
vide any real support for a prosecu-
tion”.
Mr Watkins responded stating,
“The public will decry this decision
as it supports a trial thousands of
miles from where the alleged crime
was committed simply because in the
DPP’s opinion, the evidence is too
weak to prosecute in the UK. If that’s
not outsourcing our criminal justice
system, I don’t know what is.”
Ahmad will now face trial in the United States
stage... the loss of £70 was probably
the best outcome I could hope for”.
The student informed the driver of
the minicab asking to not be left with
the con man.
Having left the student in the mini-
cab with all of his belongings, the
con man returned to say that he now
required £200. The student avoided
withdrawing this money by telling
the con man that he had reached his
overdraft limit. The American man
then attempted to take the mini cab
to a “relative’s house”, but the driver
did not take him. The driver then left,
and the student told the con man
that he could not help any more. The
driver then picked the student up
further down the road and took the
student to Kensington police station.
In the police station, the crime
took 4 hours to report.
The crime has also been reported
to the Imperial College Police Oﬃcer
and the Imperial College Head of Se-
curity.
The student said: “I was lucky to
lose only £70. Had it not been for the
decency of the cab driver, it may have
ended up much worse”.

BUCS changes could affect sports teams
Changes to the league that Imperial Col-
lege London’s sports teams play in could
require some reorganisation.
The teams are currently split into Im-
perialCollege(whichisallofthesubjects
from the university) and Medics (which,
as hinted in the name, is Medicine).
However, it was brought up in Council
on Monday 8 October by the President
of the Imperial College School of Medi-
cine Students’ Union President, Shiv
Vorha, that the league is going to force
Imperial to change. This change could
mean that teams will lose positions in
leagues, or be put into diﬀerent leagues.
It was decided at Council that it would
be more pertinent for the sports teams
to discuss the issue.
would all be appointed. They would
be the Lay Trustees, College Gover-
nor, Life Member, and two appointed
Student Trustees. The Student Trus-
tees would be appointed by being put
forward by the Appointments and Re-
munerations Committee, ratiﬁed by
Council, and approved by the Trustee
Board. Any Trustee could be removed
by a 2/3rd vote of Council.
The Trustee Board would no longer
have 4 Student Trustees voted by the
entire student body, and the Court
Chair would no longer have a place.
Another change is that the RSM
would become a Constituent Union,
along with all of the other current Fac-
ulty Unions (RCSU, CGCU ICSMSU).
In Council, this point did cause some
contention about how it would eﬀect
representation.
The position of a Sabbatical Oﬃcer
for Postgraduates is put forward as
well. The paper says that Beaumont’s
opinion is that the Graduate Schools
Association (GSA) President being
the Sabbatical Oﬃcer would work
best. Also the Faculty Unions (e.g.
RCSU) would no longer be represent-
ing Postgraduates, with the GSA tak-
ing that role.
A change proposed in elections was
that the Returning Oﬃcer would be an
external person.
Paul Beaumont will be writing a Com-
ment article for next week’s Felix to ex-
plain the changes. To see the document
