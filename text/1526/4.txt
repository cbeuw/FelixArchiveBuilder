Brief overview of how the table is compiled
Firstly, it should be noted that Imperial College London is ranked the exact same in the world as it was
last year.
The table is compiled in a similar way to many other tables: that is that the academics, teaching, and
citations are assessed. The criteria are, with the weighting used in brackets: academic reputation (40%
– the highest), employer reputation (10%), ratio of staff to students (20%), which is there to assess
teaching, citations per faculty (20%), amount of international students and staff (10%).

favour of teaching. The Times Higher Education say that this is because their expert advisors have noted
