FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER
veryone says that a year
abroad is one of the most
exciting journeys of self-
discovery you can go on.
They are right. I thought
I’d share some noteworthy (if not
always happy) memories of my time
abroad.
Arrival
I missed my ﬂight to Germany, re-
sulting in a terrifying start to the
year. After many panicked calls, I
hopped on the next ﬂight, having
spent the day getting to know Gat-
wick. A few hours later, I arrived at
my building, where I slyly tailed an
unsuspecting resident in, and then
called upon my new neighbours to
help break into my bedroom with a
credit card and a knife – great ﬁrst
impression! I then had my ﬁrst taste
of halls in Germany… a wardrobe, a
desk, and a bookshelf… and that’s all.
No bed. No curtains. I rolled out my
sleeping bag onto the ﬂoor, wonder-
ing just what I had let myself in for…
Party Time
Just like here, the start of the academ-
ic year kicks oﬀ with a plethora of
alcohol-fuelled nights out, especially
for the huge community
of international
students.
The switch
from London
to a student-
based commu-
nity was a huge
one. Student life
revolved around
the Pontstrasse,
a single street
full of cheap
student-friendly
bars, clubs, and
restaurants. From

vourite invention,

The placement year is touted as a commendable and worthwhile achievement
to undertake. Unfortunately, in our current economic times, they are neither in
surplus nor simple to acquire, even for students from Imperial. All I can say is: at
the interview, be passionate and knowledgeable about your employer and your
employment. It will sell a portion of your case for you.
My experience in Norwich at The Sainsbury Laboratory has been eye-open-
ing, educational, and enjoyable. Thus far I have spent 8 months developing my
own project looking into expression of the protein receptor FLS2 and its func-
tion in the plant immune response. While the learning curve was steep initially –
what you actually do in practice is far different from the theory you get taught –
it allows you to better appreciate what goes into the discoveries that you study.
I have further been introduced to the way science is truly global, arguably a
double edged sword. Brilliant because you can meet and interact with people
that you would never meet otherwise, but there is also the moving from place
to place regularly, meaning you will have to start the process of making friends
repeatedly; not an easy challenge for some.
You can, of course, find different methods of keeping your mind preoccupied
– sports for example are a valuable outlet that allow you to relax after a long
day. As is going out with friends for a few pints at the local pub – something
Norwich certainly doesn’t have a shortage of. Before 2008 it boasted a pub for
every day of the year!
All said, the year in industry is an excellent way of finding out whether aca-

Friendship
Possibly the most
incredible part of
my Erasmus experi-
ence was the num-
ber of great friends I
made. Although being
abroad can be daunt-
ing, there’s a strange
liberation to knowing
you can say anything
to anyone, safe in the
knowledge that in a
year’s time you’ll be
countries apart. “Hello,
I’m new here, will you
be my friend?” loses the
threat of complete humiliation… and
it works! By the end of the year my
room was fully furnished with gifts
from my new friends, including a
bed! I also learned a huge amount
about life in places I had barely even
heard of and got to experience new
cultures from home, as well regularly
jumping onto trains across Europe in
my spare time. From discovering a
love of Azerbaijani cuisine, to turn-
ing up to a Finnish sauna gathering
(and then making a hasty exit when
everyone turned out to be naked) I
found myself thriving in a world of
new experiences.
Needless to say, from a shaky start,
my Erasmus year developed into an
incredible, eye-opening experience.
I couldn’t recommend a year abroad
more to anybody even slightly inter-
ested in travel… and I can’t wait to
start visiting my new friends world-
wide!
