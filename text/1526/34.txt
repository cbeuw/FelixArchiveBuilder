Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
change his status to “I’m gay”. Then
people will think he’s gay!
OBAMARAMATYME2012

penis looks nothing like mitt’s. Use

Internshit
I sat in the dim-lit cubi-
cle, struggling to properly
make out the naked pho-
tos on the tiny handheld
screen in front of me. My
life had become a combination of
instant coﬀee, pringle jumpers and
pixelated tits. But it didn’t bother
me, I just sat there tugging away
at my shrivelled dick, desperately
trying to think of anything that just
might get me oﬀ and momentarily
lift me out of my crummy exist-
ence.
Day one: a rough day at the oﬃce,
and not exactly the life-enriching
experience I had in mind. I was
expecting it to be as advertised: a
fantastic opportunity with a world-
leading team that would harvest
my talents to make the world a bet-
ter place. Instead I found myself in
a dusty store cupboard, surround-
ed by idiots and other lost souls,
praying to be left the fuck alone.
This is my introduction, and
I’ll keep it brief. I’m ugly, white,
and twenty years old, and sup-
posedly full of ambition. But this
ambition extends about as far as
the JobSeekers website, or a me-
diocre Hangman column. I’m now
trapped in the teeth of a large mul-
tinational – you’ve probably heard
of them – and bound by contract
to remain in this tomb for the next
twelve months.
Stay tuned, because hilarity is
sure to ensue as I become increas-
ingly distant from anything worth
living for, and realise that it’s all
been a big fucking mistake. I’ll
keep you in the loop on my co-
workers, team-building exercises,
and mid-morning masturbation –
because that’s all I have to live for
now, kids. I suggest you start prac-
ticing sucking city boy cock right
this second, or develop a passion
for something niche that nobody
in their right mind would be inter-
ested in, so you can avoid the same
fate – my fellatio skills are average
at best and my interests far too
common, and both have got me
nowhere. Please, kids, learn from
my mistakes.
I’ll drip feed the series
of events over the com-
ing weeks, so that in
the future my lonely,
dementia-riddled self
can look back and think
‘shit, things used to be a
lot worse than this’. And
who knows, maybe it’ll
cheer you up, knowing
there’s some poor twat
out there having an
even worse time than
you. Right now I’m looking
over at my manager, Sheila.
She’s the main cause of my
disdain. She looks like a
transvestite Phil Mitchell
on her way back from a Bill
Gates-themed gangbang.
Her Marlboro mouth smells
fucking putrid, and her in-
competence is enough to
make me want to beat her
over the head with a shovel
until the oﬃce runs red with blood.
Anyway, I’d best be getting back
to work. There’s a whole bunch
of cases I have to attend to. Who
knows, maybe yours, along with all
its dark secrets, is in there some-
where. Maybe you’re the chubby
19 year old man from Essex whose
tits won’t stop lactating. And if you
are, I just want you to know that
we all laugh at you. Nobody is here
because they care about people:
they’re here because other people’s
misery gives them some smug sat-
isfaction. I bet you’re feeling pret-
ty optimistic about the start
of the new academic year,
aren’t you? Well I want you
to know that for most of
you it’s going to be fucking
terrible: your grades, aspi-
rations, and standards in
sexual partners will slip
massively over the next
few weeks. But don’t
worry, because I want
you to know that my
year is going to be much,
much worse. I hope that
fact brings you some joy.
Follow the adventures of a
disgruntled Imperialite as he
regrets his decision to take a
year out and enter the work-
place, where he finds himself
overworked, underappreciat-
ed, and surrounded by fucking
idiots. Stay tuned and watch
hilarity ensue as he enters the
fight for his salary and sanity.

Mickey Luff welcomes you to his world...
It will get hotter in the Library
The claim from Imperial College Li-
brary staﬀ that Level 4 “can and will be
made hotter” has been met with scepti-
cism by disillusioned students.
Students have long demanded higher
studying temperatures and the calls
were renewed during this summer’s
disappointingly tepid revision condi-
tions.
“I was shocked, it barely reached the
melting point of steel,” said one angry
student, “and they call themselves a
great institution, I’ve heard they’re able
to produce nuclear fusion in the UCL
Library’s reception”
.
Imperial responded to the complaints
by releasing a statement that claimed
they had several plans in place for rais-
ing the popular area to study-worthy
temperatures:
“We’ve taken on board the comments
and – rest assured – we are already im-
plementing a number of procedures to
ensure that no student leaves the library
without at least one sweat patch”
.
A spokesman added: “We’ve already
removed the fans and ensured that the
computers are constantly running Dia-
blo 3 in the background on full graphics
settings. We’re also considering replac-
ing desk chairs with high-end Bosch
ovens”
.
Not all students have taken to the an-
nounced plans. A third year chemist
said: “we don’t simply need more heat in
order to compete with places like Mar-
bella or Rwanda. Give us a few tonnes
of sand and a paddling pool too; maybe
a cocktail bar – then we’re in business.”
