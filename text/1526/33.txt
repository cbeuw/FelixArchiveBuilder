TWITTER HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK
Mitt Romney @MittRomney
It is time to change course in the Middle East.
Americamusthave confidence in our cause,
clarityin ourpurpose, andresolvein our
might.
I know 140 characters isn’t
much to work with, but
Romney’s hit a home run
here. Never has there been
so much said, yet so little.
If patriotic fervour with
just a dash of sinister floats
your boat, fair play to you
my friend. #yikes!

uckle up folks, this is
real talk.
It’s that time of year
when your colleagues
are eagerly discussing
what hedge funds they’re looking to
work at, and the best way to iron out
the creases in their power suits.
There might be some of you out
there highly anxious about the fact
that everyone else seems to have ap-
plied to hundreds of lame and square
city ﬁrms. But don’t despair – you can
too! With none of the eﬀort!
What better time than this to in-
troduce Coﬀee Break’s own foolproof
guide of securing a job... 101% of the
time!
1) GO ON THE APPRENTICE
Forget all these online applications to
places you don’t really know a whole
lot about apart from the massive sala-
ries they oﬀer. Television’s the new up-
coming medium and people jump at
the chance to be shouted at by an an-
gry man in a conﬁned space. It might
not be the gruelling twelve-week job
interview it once was, but if you end
up as Lord Alan’s chosen one, you’re
set for a glittering career.
2) RELEASE A NUMBER ONE SINGLE
Recruiters everywhere look for inter-
esting details on your CV, and what’s
more interesting than scoring an in-
ternational hit single!
You only need to believe. If Geldof

can do it, then so can you.
For the big bucks, aim for Christ-
mas. It’s not hard, just toss together
a few Christmas related lyrics and
something about famine.
3) THERE IS NO 3
And there you have it. If neither of
the previous work then you’re doing
it wrong.
Follow our plan and you’re guaran-
teed to land yourselves in the dollar.
