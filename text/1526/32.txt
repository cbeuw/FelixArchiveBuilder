ecause that’s what femi-
nism’s all about, right?
Right? Wrong, but from
the incredulous looks,
comments and questions
we got at Freshers’ Fair, it seems like a
lot of you really believe that the goals
of feminism are to overthrow and sub-
jugate men and introduce a gynocratic
fempire. Consider your entrance to Im-
perial and this article your welcome to
reality. You’re in the real world now, and
you’re here to learn. So, get learning:
What actually is feminism, then?
The belief that men and women should
have equal rights and should not be
judged based on their gender. Nothing
more, nothing less. It’s not about female
supremacism or misandry: it’s about
equality.
But men and woman are equal! Sex-
ism doesn’t exist any more.
No, they aren’t: a quick look at Impe-
rial’s gender ratio will show you that
women are still encouraged away from
“hard” subjects. In business and poli-
tics women are underpaid and under-
represented, with each becoming more
male-dominated further up the ladder.
Their appearance, weight and personal
lives are obsessed over (see this paper’s
comments on Louise Mensch last year),
and they are frequently victims of har-
assment, sexual assault, and rape.
Men are oppressed too: look at how
few men get custody in divorce cases!
Also, men can be raped and abused as
well.
We know, and we care about these is-
sues. Yes, really. Feminists believe in
Mandatory castrations for all!

The Feminist Society and why it might not be what you think it is
equality for all genders: our society tells
us that women, not men, should care for
children, and thus women get custody
(although in fact, when men bother to
ﬁght for custody, the majority get it).
Feminists want this to change. As for
male rape and abuse? Of course, we
want those to end too, but they have a
small incidence compared to similar
abuse against women, which is why
you’ll hear us talking about them less.
I’m an equalist/humanist because
I care about all issues, so I’m not a
feminist.
Yes, you are. “Feminism,” although
about equality, gets its name from the
fact that women are currently the op-
pressed gender, and when the move-
ment started, were truly second-class
citizens, unable to vote, buy property or
get an oﬃcial education. So, what about
racism, homophobia, transphobia and
other forms of bigotry? Those are is-
sues we care about as well, and in many
cases, there’s a big overlap with them
and feminism: this is something we call
intersectionality.
I heard feminists believe X.
There is no singular deﬁning philosophy
or belief in feminism, save for gender
equality. Sure, some feminists may be-
lieve what you’ve heard, but that doesn’t
mean all, or even a majority, of them do.
I’m a man, can I still be a feminist?
Anyonecanbeafeminist.Itdoesn’tmat-
ter if you’re male, female, gay, straight
(or anywhere in between); whether you
shave your legs or not or whether your
hair is short or long.
How can I be a good feminist?
First of all, educate yourself. Read up on
terms like privilege, intersectionality,
slut-shaming and rape. Secondly, stop
generalising: any time you think, “wom-
en are all X,” stop and consider that for
a moment: really? Are all women like
that? If you think it’s wrong when people
say that all men are sex-crazed brutes,
realise that similar generalisations about
women are just as wrong, and congratu-
lations, you’re a feminist!
What does the Feminist Society do?
The Feminist Soc is just a place for like-
minded people to gather together in a
safe space. We’re planning on hosting
speakers during the year, ﬁlm nights, a
book club and probably a fair few bar
nights. We’re welcome to people of all
genders, orientations and persuasions
so feel free to come along to any of our
events if you’re interested.
Join our Facebook group at facebook.
com/groups/ICFeministSociety/ or
come along to meet us in 568 on Mon-
day, the 15th of October, from 6 o’ clock.
Sir,
A friend and I were at the Union last
Wednesday, having not been there
for some time. After having paid for the
privilege of entering the
quadrangle in order to purchase drinks
- something which I ﬁnd highly
irksome, we were aﬀorded a wait of
more than 20 mins to exchange our
cash for a plastic cup of poor-quality
beer. It may be “the longest
student bar in the UK” but if it is
chronically understaﬀed (as is
absolutely always the case) it will (and
does) generate queues to
rival its length. I also feel it is unusual
for the Union to employ a
number of bar staﬀ to meander aim-
lessly behind said bar exchanging
jokes with each other, as seems to be the
case. When will the Union
get its act together?

Sir,
I would like to take this opportunity to
publicly express my disappointment at
the apparent lack of personal clean-
liness amongst some students in the
Department of Computing. Lectures
are gruelling already without the im-
position of certain individuals’ bodily
eﬀusions.

Sir,
I feel I must complain about the sheer
number of banal emails I have received
this week from the CGCU President.
Perhaps he may consider grouping his
communications into a weekly digest
or allowing recipients to unsubscribe
from what is nothing other than a reg-
ular spaﬃng of uninteresting text.

FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER
reen week really seems
like a redundant idea
to me. It makes it seem
like it’s ok to go around
burning fossil fuels and
not recycling paper for the other 51
weeks. This year I really want to tack-
le green issues with an initiative that
has some impact. I think it is high
time that as students of an institute
internationally renowned for scien-
tiﬁc research we took some initiative
with our green issues. Do you? Come
along to the Green Forum on Tues-
day 16th October in Meeting rooms
4/5 in the East Wing basement in Beit
Quad.
