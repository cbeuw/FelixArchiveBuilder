stodgy practicality and into a modern
form of British glamour. Shapes were
1940s-inspired – capes and capelets;
skirts to the knee. However the show
was anything but demure: shorts were
super-short, colours were brassy me-
tallics and rich brights.
Milan is home to the iconic Italian
brands: Gucci, Fendi, Prada, Versace,
and Dolce and Gabbana. Each collec-
tion walked to the beat of a completely
unique drum: at Prada we were in Ja-
pan, at Dolce in Sicily, and at Versace
it was a vampy Italian incarnation of
Coachella. Then, Fendi showed graph-
ic, fur-trimmed 60s silhouettes, and at
Gucci there were bright colour-block-
ing and 70s shapes.
However, the high point of fashion
month was certainly Paris. Gareth
Pugh was startlingly beautiful and ro-
mantic yet severe, with blood-stained
eye-makeup – to me it screamed Li-
lith-chic. Vampires and fang-bangers
everywhere: Pugh is where it’s at.
Balenciaga was thrilling and sexy,
with ﬂashes of skin in plentiful supply:
Ghesquière showed plunging sweet-
heart necklines, bare midriﬀs under
suits, and skirts cut shockingly high
on the thigh. There were handbags at
dawn at the Saint Laurent show. When
Hedi Slimane didn’t oﬀer New York
Times Fashion Editor Cathy Horyn a
seat at his ﬁrst collection at the house,
she proceeded to review his show as
lacklustre (it was). Haider Ackermann
continues to be a Paris highlight.
So, what’s the parting message?
What should you be stocking up on
for next season, and what trends are
going to look so old that you won’t
even be able to deal with it? The sim-
ple conclusion to fashion week is that
each editor, stylist, buyer and consum-
er draws their own conclusion. There
are some trends that surface as THE
trends for the season, but some fade
into the ether. Block colours, mono-
chrome and beautifully cut trousers
will be a highlight, but the fact is that
what trickles down into the hands of
the ordinary consumer is dictated
largely by the major editors and buy-
ers. And also what the people at Zara
and Topshop think that you might
like.

FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER
Saskia Verhagen Fashion Editor
For those unfamiliar, fashion month
is a bi-annual occasion made up of
fashion weeks in the four fashion
capitals, where the fashion commu-
nity (editors, buyers, bloggers and
celebrities alike) collects to view the
major designers’ collections for the
following season. This September saw
the presentations for spring/summer
2013, beginning in New York.
The major trend-setting collec-
tions to watch in New York are Marc
Jacobs and Alexander Wang – the new
school. Wang went with a predictably
monochrome palette, as well as his
signature streamlined sporty silhou-
ette – nothing new to report there,
bar some cutout detailing and (the
highlight of NYFW) his devastat-
ingly chic 3-year-old niece, Aila,
in the front row, complete with
black alligator print halter dress,
mini Chanel 2.55, Ray Ban Way-
farers and tiny Nikes.
Jacobs’ show served as
a prelude to his oﬀering at
Louis Vuitton. Starting at home
at his own label, he showed thick
stripes in a Factory Girl-inspired
show, with ﬂared shapes and
simple styling – hair backcombed
at the crown and tied into a low
ponytail, with thick black eye-
liner. Later, at his show for Louis
Vuitton in Paris, he showed an
amped-up version: more six-
ties shapes but this time, bold
checks both in chic mono-
chrome and in 60s brights:
avocado green and lemon
yellow. The Damier print
handbags also found them-
selves reincarnated in the
new colours.
Lifetime members of New York,
and stars of red carpet glamour, Os-
car de la Renta and Ralph Lauren
did not disappoint. The ﬁrst half of
Lauren’s show might have appeared
like a Spanish costume drama, com-
plete with fringed piano shawls,
matador jackets and ﬂamenco ruf-
ﬂes. However the Latin theme came
into its own for eveningwear: Karlie
“Oh girl that
Prada fox stole is
from like, before I
was born. Not chic.”
Kloss waved her fan-shaped clutch
bag wearing a crisp white shirt and
ﬂoor-length black sequinned crochet
skirt, topped with a black felt boater,
followed by ﬂuttering white organza
ruﬄes, and a red ﬁshtail dress with a
ﬂouncing black bolero jacket.
Oscar’s show had more variety –
from perfectly cut black gowns and
a Cruella DeVil monochrome sheath
dress to the full-blown embellished
glory of a turquoise blue feathered
ballgown and a strapless fuschia num-
ber embroidered with green pom-
poms – a sure bet for the red carpet.
Anna Wintour graces very few
shows at London Fashion Week –
despite being London-born, she only
began attending LFW a cou-
ple of seasons ago. Now
though, London is
home to some excit-
ing designers – Erdem,
Christopher Kane, and
Christopher Bailey
for Burberry Pror-
sum. Other British
labels, including
Stella McCartney,
Alexander Mc-
Queen and Ga-
reth Pugh have
since decamped
to Paris, consid-
ered a more prestig-
ious place to show.
Kane and Erdem
shared a common
pallete of sweet pas-
tels, though Erdem
punctuated his with
ﬂashes of ﬂuorescent
brights and Kane
with touches of
punk – gaﬀer tape,
ﬁligree rubber, and
leather. The pieces
were trim and ladylike, yet
modern in fabric and cut.
At Burberry, Bailey seems
to be moving the brand out of
