FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER
Masterpiece of the Mundane
Much has been said derisively of the
German sense of humour, but my
favourite book review of all time,
translated for me by a friend, was of
Jonathan Franzen’s 2010 work and ap-
peared in a the German newspaper
Süddeutsche Zeitung. The closing pas-
sage of it read, simply: “It’d probably
be unbearably boring if it wasn’t such
a masterpiece”.
This critical assessment is arguably
true for all brilliant books (and ﬁlms,
and albums, and art) however with
Freedom it feels particularly salient.
The story itself rotates around the life
and dysfunctions of a normal-enough
middle-class family: dysfunctions
which have been well-worn by soap-
operas and agony aunts but, when ex-
plored in Freedom, become painfully
real and thoroughly absorbing.
The sheer length and depth of the
book is physically daunting. At several
points throughout the story I could
feel the plot reaching a point that
another author could’ve comfortably
began wrapping up, however with an
output of just under one book a dec-
ade, Franzen isn’t in any hurry to ﬁn-
ish. By employing several interesting
writing techniques — for example by
not only shifting the imagined story
teller, but also the imagined audience
of the story being told — and by fo-
cusing on only 4 characters, Freedom
manages to
avoid reading
like it’s well
over half the
length of War
& Peace, despite
actually being so.
Unfortunately,
however, Franzen
is a complete
bell-end. If a book
is about a white,
middle-class liberal
American of mixed
Jewish/Scandina-
vian heritage from
Minnesota and is
written by a white,
middle-class liberal
American of mixed
Jewish/Scandinavian
heritage from Minne-
sota, and that guy is a
bell-end, then his book
is very likely to be full
of complete bell-ends.
Unfortunately Franzen
is so good at writing that
a) you don’t want to put
the book down because
reading his writing is too
damn enjoyable and b) the
characters are so robustly
produced and their char-
acter so expertly conveyed
through fantastic story tell-
ing that every last little irri-
tating despicable part of their
The much anticipated latest novel in
Iain M. Banks epic space opera series.
As with all of Banks’ work you can
expect this to be an intelligent and
highly engaging read. All the Culture
novels are standalone so this is a great
oppertunity to get into the series.
Orange prize winner Zadie Smith re-
turns to writing with another highly
acclaimed novel. NW tells the pow-
erful story of four people from an
impoverished North West London
housing block development. A must
read that deserves all of its accolades.
Despite Hamilton being best known
for his trilogies and long series, his
latest oﬀering is a standalone novel.
This is the perfect opportunity get
acquainted with this brilliant author
before he visits the College for the
Picocon SF convention in February.
Scalzi’s latest novel parodies the ten-
ancy in Star Trek of redshirted secu-
rity oﬃcers dying with alarming reg-
ularity while main characters remain
unscathed. While not yet published
in the UK you can get a US import
from Forbidden Planet.
While Rowling’s ﬁrst novel for adults
has received mixed reviews, it’s still
worth a look. While certainly not a
highbrow masterpiece much of the
ﬂair that made Harry Potter such a
phenomenon is still on show. A good
if unchallenging novel.
Time to spare — try these five great new reads
god-forsaken personality is known to
you. The ﬁnal result is that the reader
is stuck reading a book full of people
they hate.
And so the book proceeds for at
least 550 of it’s 600 pages. Remark-
ably, considering its core of four
characters and a plot focusing on
the collapse of the marriage be-
tween two of them, it feels like it
comprehensively and cynically
deals with every single talis-
manic problem liberal America
prides itself on having a voice
on: Family, Tradition, Mental
Health, Environmentalism,
Women’s Rights, Commer-
cialism and The Iraq War. The
central theme that holds all
these together though is free-
dom — perhaps unsurprising
given the name of the book
— and the novel explorers
its meanings and conse-
quences, for good and ill.
By subtly combining
enough food for thought
on broad moral dilemmas,
expertly satirising recent
periods of western his-
tory and society but all
the while keeping it to
within the conﬁnes of
an entirely relatable and
moving personal family
story, Franzen weaves
a masterpiece from the
truly mundane.
