FRIDAY 12 OCTOBER

hen contemplat-
ing my year in
France, I imag-
ined myself sur-
rounded by vari-
ous French friends, drinking wine in
the sun and eating bread and cheese.
I found myself slightly disappointed.
The cheese and wine were present in
abundance but the French?! Where
were they?
As one of the only foreign stu-
dents to arrive in September to an
agricultural university in the south
of France, I thought it quite likely
that most of my acquaintances
would be from France. How-
ever, I could count the people of
French origin who would stop
and say hello on one hand. Af-
ter 10 months there, I feel that
is somewhat shocking.
That is not to say that I did
not make friends there; there
were some very lovely peo-
ple from all over the world.
Every weekend I spent my
time with a group of for-
eigners speaking in pigeon
French. Most of the ﬁrst
term was spent solely with
Brazilians (strangely there
were around twenty!), with
very little contact with the
Erasmus orgasmus: an introduction
Errrrgh, which way to a chip butty?
The ever expanding programme is
mixing Europeans up. Students not
only polish their language skills on
their year out, but discover other
delights. A true immersion in an-
other culture is something different
to travelling here and there.
Erasmus is a truly European ex-
perience, where Bulgarians date
Brits, Poles swoon with Swedes,
and Germans canoodle with Span-
iards. As well as much loving, there
is, of course, much heartbreak and
STI-spreading. As summed up by
Umberto Eco, Erasmus is a “sexual
revolution,” where people are be-
coming European. His example in-
volved a Catalan man and a Flemish
girl shacking up. Of course, he is
romanticising, for there are risks
of culture clashes and messy, long
distance mishaps. However, you
cannot help but be impressed by
the German guy becoming fluent
in Polish for his newfound love or
at the French man proposing to his
English rose. For the record, both
are true stories.
Don’t forget: we are truly lucky
to live in the Europe we have to-
day; we have had peace for seventy
years, and it has been more than
two decades since the fall of the
Berlin Wall. Don’t forget we are free
to study where we want, when we
want, intellect and money provid-
ing (Erasmus helps with the latter,
but not the former).
Do not be limited by Erasmus. It
doesn’t take that much effort to up
sticks, go pick grapes in the Bor-
deaux region, au-pair in Prague,
or intern in Vienna. Where there
is a will, there is a way. Don’t limit
yourself. If you have a second lan-
guage, no matter how hazy, use it,
go and improve on it! Even if you
don’t, with English as the lingua
franca, the world is your oyster. Go
explore, work and study elsewhere,
for it has never ever been easier.

Integration issues

inhabitants of the country I lived in.
Unfortunately when there was some
communication with these
elusive nationals, they
lacked originality in their
conversation. As the only
foreign girl taking one
module I was asked around
150 times whether I was the
English girl. Awkwardly, that
appeared to be the only ques-
tion that they could come up
with, and I have lost count of
the number of embarrassing si-
lences which followed in those
ﬁrst four weeks.
Perhaps they were just not
interested in trying to decipher
what I was saying? I for one think
it is sad that they are missing out
on the opportunity to mix with
people from all over the world
and learn new stuﬀ. Unsurprisingly
there was no Erasmus club there;
something which I think shows that
they are not ready to welcome the
world with fully open arms.
I must note that this lack of French
interaction is not necessarily lack-
ing for all the Erasmus students in
Montpellier; the only American male
seemed to be attracting the attention
of the whole French female commu-
nity! Superﬁcial much?
