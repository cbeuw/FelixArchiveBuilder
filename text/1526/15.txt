NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS OF OUR BARS
Due to College ID cards not being provided with a ‘red box’ this year for students
who are under eighteen, the Union will have to be even more diligent than normal
when checking students’ identification on entering bars.
Students visiting the Union’s bars – both in South Kensington and Charing Cross
– will have to show photo identification on entry to the venue (passport, driving
licence or pass ID), and at the bar too. Students who are under eighteen are
still welcome to come to the bars, but extra care will be taken to ensure that no
alcohol is being bought ‘on behalf’ of others.
Please don’t be offended by more identification checks than normal – these
measures are purely as a precaution to protect the Union’s licence to sell alcohol
and shouldn’t affect your enjoyment of the bars in anyway!
The Union would like to remind students that our bars, whilst not public, are
licensed premises, and anyone found to be breaking these or any other Union
rules will face disciplinary action.
