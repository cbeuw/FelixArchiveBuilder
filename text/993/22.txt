Mother's Day
Don't forget that it's Mother's Day this Sunday.
For those of you who, like me, manage to
completely forget things like this, there's a
florist that does Interflora deliveries on
Kensington Church Walk (tel: 071 602 4158),
although you'll probably need to have more
money than sense, because Interflora isn't
cheap, but I suppose that's the price you have to
pay for not being organised.
Elections
I know you're probably all sick to death of the
sabbatical elections by now, but it won't be for
much longer. Soon you'll be able to walk down
the Walkway or sit in the JCR without being
confronted by pictures of candidates smiling, oh
so sincerely, at you.
But, as I keep being told, this is democracy in
action. Really!? What it comes down to is which
candidate can get themselves known to the most
people in the two weeks of campaigning. They
will work their way round the halls and the JCR
and turn up to as many Union events as possible,
anything to show that they care, or is it anything
that will get them those extra few votes. (Did
you see some of them turned up to the E G M .
An Invitation
Dear Felix
We are trying to find out whether those of us
here at Imperial, staff and students, who are
lesbians or gay men are interested in contacting
each other and maybe having some kind of
network or forming some kind of group.
Anything!! It's up to us to decide what we want.
We're trying to diminish the isolation some of
us feel here at the College and, as a first step to
gauge what level of interest there is, we invite
And International Nite is always a favourite with
the candidates.)
But how many people actually vote on the
policies of the candidates? How many of the
candidates will actually carry out their
promises? OK, so some of the ideas might be
impractical and they won't know what they can
and can't do until they start the job. But maybe
these wonderful plans are just there to get votes?
Looking at some of the manifestoes, I'd guess
that this is probably the case. But it happens
every year and you don't find out until it's too
late whether or not you voted for the right
person.
I've been told by the President that Felix is
not allowed to 'champion the cause of new
election', but looking at the lack of publicity for
it, I will say that if you are in the least bit unsure
about any of the candidates and/or their policies,
you can vote for new election. This means the
election for that post will be re-run with the
possibility that new candidates will stand. The
same candidates may stand again, but at least
you'll be able to see that they have a genuine
desire to do the job and there will be more time
for them to convince you that they really are the
right person for the job.
you to drop a line to us, Paula and Ron, letting
us know what you think about this approach and
if there is sufficient interest we'll arrange some
kind of get together.
Letters, notes, postcards, whatever can be
placed in the pigeonhole marked ' L G M
Network' in the IC Union Office, Level One,
Union Building.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Paula and Ron
