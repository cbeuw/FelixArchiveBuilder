Does IC integrate its students well enough?
"It could do better, though it's better than
other colleges - I have friends in Leicester
where you really do get sects apart..."
Alastair Forance, Geology III
"The best thing last year was when I was up
on stage compering! It might have lost its
appeal!'' Zena Perrara, An ex-compere!
A final prayer or at least a deep breath!
The cultural show begins promptly, the flag
ceremony running smoothly and elicitating wild
cheers with every new entry. Just what do they
put into that Mediterranean water? The noise
makes me grin and the stage is set for a
whirlwind tour, Orient Express style.
Some fear that the world is becoming
homogenised, an MTV template stamped on
every capital from Berlin to Bangkok. Yes, it's
worrying, but I would say that countries are like
the people that populate them. Sometimes
subtley different, sometimes radically at odds
with our own 'normals' (whatever nationality we
may hold), they're always impossible to
categorise. It comes home with every new act:
rhythmic variations, body movements, colour
and clothing. And we can enjoy each one.
Andy Wensley said to me before the show:
"A quarter of College is from overseas and there
isn't enough mixing of cultures. We need to
promote successes like these." So look at the
pictures and remember, or wish you were there...
