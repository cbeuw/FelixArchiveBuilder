Cracking Cryptic Crosswords
Lesson 13. What could this mean?
The inclusion of a question mark in a clue
might be significant. I used to think it was an
admission that the clue was crap but I ' l l
acknowledge there are times when it has its
uses. Firstly, it could just be a red herring put in
to make the clue read better:
1. Was Edward killed? (6)
Another use of the question mark is when the
straightforward definition of the clue is not so
straightforward after all. Specifically i f the
answer to a clue was BIRD the straightforward
definition might be 'swallow' (adequately
deceptive). However, you could justly argue
that 'swallow' is not a definition of a bird,
rather it is an example. Therefore the clue
should reflect this and a question mark comes
in very handy here:
Find the heads of Brazilian iguanas really
difficult to swallow? (4)
[See lesson 11]
So here the question mark reflects that a
swallow is an example of a bird and not another
name for the bird genus. In this type of example
the question mark could be replaced by words
such as 'maybe' or 'perhaps'.
Another use of the question mark is to
accompany a quirky definition. These clues
may not contain two wholly independent
methods for getting the answer unlike all those
discussed previously. They will often be written
for phrases:
2. Hereditary diarrhoea? (4,2,3,6)
3. Will you find a camper here? (6)
4. Grumpy tells how he made a more
malleable steel? (5-8)
5. Tricked by one's chauffeur? (5,3,1,4)
6. Have second thoughts about the by-pass
operation? (6,2,5)
7. Popeye the compere? (6-3)
8. A substitute for shoes? (5-2)
9. How fashions change annually, perhaps
(4,2,4,3)
10. Umpire's decision? Come off it! (4,4)
You can probably see how the question mark
cleans up any unconventional aspects of the
clue.
Lesson 14. Oh yeah!
What of the exclamation mark? This, too, I
used to think was a cop-out for a poor clue. I
still think this. Well it's usually used to mark a
clue which the compiler considers to work
rather well, rah-rah.
This lesson, however, is not about the
exclamation mark. It is about a type of clue
unlike any other - some call it the 'click!' or the
'oh yeah!' clue. This genre only has one part to
the clue i.e. not a straightforward and a cryptic
component. They might be accompanied by an
exclamation mark to indicate that they are a
little unconventional (as with the question
mark).
If you try these examples you could be put
off for they might seem a little unfair. Not so,
because, in a crossword, you can always leave
them until you have got some cross-referenced
letters and that, after all, is what makes
crosswords so inherently easy.
11. Study-form (10)
12. Huge surfer! (5,4)
13. The main debris (7)
14. A good read? (5)
15. Light relief? (8)
16. Senseless velocity! (5)
17. Speaker is on course here, maybe (8)
18. He makes love with a quiver (5)
19. A turn-up (10)
20. Francaise (6)
