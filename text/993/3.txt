Supercomputer Science Debate
BY JOE MCFADDEN
One of the most powerful super-
computers in the world is coming to
Imperial College, courtesy of elec-
tronics giant Fujitsu.
The Japanese company has
loaned the API000 computer to
Imperial College's Department of
Computing for use in research on
parallel computer applications. This
paves the way for the creation of a
European Centre for Parallel
Computing at Imperial. H R H The
Princess Royal will officially open
the Centre on Tuesday 24th May.
The supercomputer w i l l be
linked to research centres through-
out Europe, as well as other College
departments. However, Govern-
ment restrictions on access to super-
computers will be applied. This
means that researchers from such
countries as Communist China may
be barred from using the facilities.
Research projects planned for
the Centre include multi-media and
virtual reality applications. Other
departments intend to run complex
programs ranging from a new
method of analysing the Earth's
core to modelling semiconductor
materials.
The new Centre will be headed
by Professor John Darlington, who
said "we look forward to a success-
ful partnership [with Fujitsu]".

The current state of British science
will come under scrutiny at a public
debate on Wednesday 23rd March.
The meeting is organised by the
Institution of Professionals,
Managers and Specialists as part of
SET7, the Government's initiative to
raise awareness of science and tech-
nology among the public. The
debate aims to question the effec-
tiveness of British science and
explore its future. Questions that will
be covered include: 'What is science
for?'; 'Is science getting its fair
share of school leavers?'; 'Can sci-
ence create more jobs?' and 'How
can science recruit more women?'
The debate will be hosted by a
panel of science experts, journalists
and M P s , consisting of David
Bellamy, Professor Jocelyn Bell-
Burnell (Open University),
Professor Alec Boksenberg (RGO),
Will Hutton (science writer for The
Guardian), Anne Campbell M P ,
Don Foster M P and Robert Jackson
MP.
Entrance to the meeting is free
and all are welcome to join in the
debate. It starts at 6.30pm and con-
tinues until 8pm. The venue is the
Old Theatre, London School of
Economics, Houghton Street,
London WC2.
Imperial Composites Conference
BY MIKE INGRAM
Imperial College's Centre for
Composite Materials will host a
conference in April dedicated to its
achievements.
The conference, entitled 'The
Challenge of Composites' will be
held on the 19th and 20th April and
will mark the 10th anniversary of
the Centre. It will include sessions
with speakers from Imperial
College as well as representatives
from Du Pont, Shell, Rolls Royce,
Ciba and British Aerospace. A n
exhibition of products, processes
and analytical software is also
planned. The conference aims to
discuss applications of composite
materials, which range from the
aerospace industry to automobile
and leisure goods.
Frank Matthews, Director of the
Centre commented: "The work of
the Centre is evidence of what can
be achieved when industry and
academia get together."
