Speech

Controversy is surrounding the sab-
batical elections. Following the
Hustings which mark the run up to
voting, there is rising concern that
students, especially first years, are
still very much in the dark about the
elections.
One area that has sparked debate
is the apparent lack of publicity for
New Election. The purpose of New
Election is to allow an election to
be re-run if voters feel that none of
the proposed candidates are suitable
for a post. Responsibility for New
Election publicity rests with the
Elections Committee, chaired by
the Returning Officer Union
President, Andy Wensley. In an
interview with Felix he explained
why the Elections Committee had
failed to publicise New Election: he
admitted deliberately underplaying
New Election because in his view it
had been used "to rubbish candi-
dates" in previous years. He added
that the role of New Election would
be made clear on flyers being
mailed to every person eligible to
vote. These will also include com-
plete details on how and where to
vote.
Despite the promises of clear
posters and leaflets stating the loca-
tions of voting stations, students
have expressed distrust in the sys-
tem. Many feel that the seven vot-
ing stations set up on the South
Kensington site (reduced from a
total of ten last year), will be inade-
quate and that this will deter people
from voting. Mr Wensley attributed
the low number of voting stations
on the new swipe card voting sys-
tem. College Security can only pro-
vide seven of the machines needed
for its operation. According to M r
Wensley, this number was decided
by Rick Bilby, last year's Deputy
President, but he has since suggest-
ed that at least three more machines
are required.
Some candidates have aired
grievances regarding the lack of
proxy voting. M r Wensley con-
firmed that one candidate has been
to see him over the matter. He has
now stated that anyone wishing to
vote by proxy should contact him as
soon as possible in the Union Office
or on extension 3501.
Students need to realise the true
value of a university education,
according to Education Secretary
John Patten.
In what has been seen by some
as a change of direction, Mr Patten
said people should examine the
value of an education rather than
the cost of funding it. In a lecture
on university values at King's
College, London on Tuesday, he
said that undergraduates have to
realise that university life is not a
"one way affair."
He suggested a list of morals
which institutions might like to pro-
mote. Those mentioned included
regard for proper authority, sensi-
tivity towards others' needs, fair-
ness, honesty, courtesy, loyalty and
self-respect.
Mr Patten was adamant that stu-
dents need to pay attention to the
responsibility they have to their
universities to conduct themselves
properly. He claimed "It is right to
expect students not only to be pre-
sent but to participate actively in
seminars, attend lectures and practi-
cals on time and hand in promptly
work undertaken to the best of their
abilities."
He also stated that students had
an obligation to the society which
helps to fund their courses. He
urged all universities to introduce
student 'contracts', setting out the
standards that learners and tutors
expected from each other.
New Constitution Delayed
BY MIKE INGRAM
AND LYNN BRAVEY
The new constitution of Imperial
College Union (ICU) has suffered
further delays. A n Extraordinary
General Meeting (EGM) was held
at 1pm on Monday to discuss and
pass the constitution document.
However, the meeting was cut short
after just over an hour by someone
calling 'quorum', apparently having
decided that too many people had
left the meeting to make further dis-
cussions valid. Despite the meet-
ing's poor turnout of about 70 peo-
ple (clearly below the quorate level
of 100), Andy Wensley, I C U
President has said student interest in
the Union is rising, due to the Union
being "a lot more professional... [and
so] maintaining a higher profile."
The majority of points raised at
the E G M were on clarification of
wording and typographical errors.
However, much debate took place
on sections covering the organisa-
tion of the Union, particularly the
re-instatement of a House Committee
responsible for the management of
Union areas in College.
The idea of a House Committee
is strongly supported by Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies),
Charlie Leary. Dismissing rumours
that he had threatened resigning
over the matter, M r Leary told
Felix: that there was a time last term
when he felt that people were
beginning to misinterpret exactly
what his job was. Societies were
coming into his office with matters
that he felt should have been dealt
with by a House Committee. He
believes sabbaticals should not have
to make policy making decisions.
He continued by questioning the
Executive Committee making deci-
sions that may seem of little or no
importance to them, but neverthe-
less are decisions that need to be
made. Mr Leary suggested that this
was where House Committee would
step in, with the advantage of being
able to "forward plan" for certain
situations.
