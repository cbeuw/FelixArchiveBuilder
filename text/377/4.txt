The White Paper on P u b l i c Expenditure
published last week brings one piece of
good news for students. It i s possible
that there w i l l be some money allocated to
build student residences. T h i s is a first
priority for city-centre institutiens such
as I C , now suffering a decline in both
applications and actual numbers, mainly
because of the ever-increasing short-
age of accommodation.
It comes at an opportune time for u s , in
particular. I have just completed a mem-
orandum on the development of the C o l -
lege for the years 1977-82. T h i s is the
U n i o n ' s contribution to the d i s c u s s i o n s
w h i c h take place before the C o l l e g e pre-
sents i t s " f i v e - y e a r p l a n " to the Univer-
sity Grants Committee from whom w e
receive our major financial support on a
five-yearly (quinquennial b a s i s ) . T h e
White Paper comes at the right moment be-
cause I h a v e J a b e l l e d our first priority to
be provision of more student accommoda-
tion, (see below)
However, it is not enough to think
that a few words in a White Paper,
hinting at a promise for three or four
wears hence is enough. Pressure must
be sustained from now on wards to
make sure that that promise is kept.
The White Paper gives hope for little
else but more cuts in education spend-
ing, in line with the present policy.
T h i s policy i s itself derived from Margaret
Thatcher's infamous White Paper of 1973,
laughingly entitled " E d u c a t i o n : A Frame-
work for E x p a n s i o n " . Since the p u b l i c a -
tion of that document, the Education
sector has steadily shrunk. Now, with R e g
Prentice carrying on the good work (is he
a future Tory leader?), there seems little
hope of reversing the trend, except by
hard campaigns -
This is yet another reason for act-
ively supporting the Grants/Cuts
Campaign mounted this term; the
future rests on success now.
A number of issues were raised in our
memorandum on the quinquennium. I have
already mentioned the provision of new
accommodation - the project which i s
s p e c i f i c a l l y singled out is completion of
L i n s t e a d H a l l . Other points:
* N o change is forecast for the Union's
structure. We will inevitably
expand our complement of full-
time officers and staff.
" Little change in the role of CCU'S.
* Redecoration of the Union building
* Expansion of the Bookshop to
provide a mere varied range of goods.
We have proposed improvements in Med-
i c a l and Welfare Services, in particular
a new c l i n i c to deal with family planning,
birth control and s o c i a l d i s e a s e s . Sports,
we have said should be an integral part of
College Life and urged construction of
new indoor f a c i l i t i e s in South Kinsington,
a s well as improved transport to H a r l i n g -
T r e v o r P h i l l i p s
ton. In a section on academic develop-
ments we c a l l for improved teaching, and
a better system of Vacation Training.
The need for greater insight into indrust-
rial practice is stressed. We support the
expansion of A s s o c i a t e d Studies, part-
icularly languages.
It remains to be seen how much of
that little lot can be achieved; 1 am
confident that these are all develop-
ments for which powerful arguments
can be made. We need a more attract-
ive College or we will have an IC
without students.
One section of the memorandum dealt
with is Women in I C . I cannot see a great
influx of women into the College in the
next seven years. However, I am confident
that the women here w i l l begin to make a
more vital and corporate contribution to
life in C o l l e g e . It i s to be hoped that the
embryo group, Women in Science, w h i c h
apparently had a very s u c c e s s f u l first
meeting last week, w i l l begin to draw
more women into considering in a serious
way, their professions. It deserves the
support of any woman with two brain c e l l s
to rub together, and it w i l l receive the
support of the U n i o n , I hope.
f there is to be an end to disincent-
ves and discouragement to women
nvolved in science and engineering,
he impetus must come from within the
institutions. Imperial College is as
good a place to start as any.
G R A N T S / CUTS
The cutbacks now taking place within the education
system are best illustrated by the numerous closedowns
of C o l l e g e s of E d u c a t i o n , a i l over the country. It i s the
avowed intention of the D E S to cut the number of teacher
training places by half - on the pretext of a f a l l i n g birth-
rate. The proposed Furzedown - P h i l l i p s F a w c e t t merger,
the total number o f students i s over 1000. After the merger
there w i l l only be 600 students. T h i s i s the meaning of
education cats - and at a time when the schools are short
of teachers, and c l a s s e s of 40 are the norm.
The D E S i s trying to close down A l n w i c h College i n
Northumberland - i n the face of opposition from the stud-
ents, staff and the townspeople, for whom the College i s
a mainstay of the l o c a l economy. A l n w i c h i s the only
C o l l e g e for miles around, and unique i n a number of respe-
c t s . It does not make sense to c l o s e it down.
But the overriding priority of Prentice and h i s minions
i s to cut costs now at any expense to the future of educ-
ation.
FIGHT THE
CUTS
The c l a i m that N U S has submitted for the Main Rate of
Grant i s £845. A 40% rise may sound like a lot. but remem-
ber that the grant i s losing its value at a rate of £7.90 per
month. P r e v i o u s grants have been s e t so as to be adequate
i n the first month of the academic year. The N U S claim i s
calculated to be more than adequate i n the first term, ade-
quate i n the second, and lagging behind only i n the third
term, when i t would be compensated for by the (theoretical)
first - term surplus.
T h i s seems to be a more sensible way of dealing with
inflation. T H E G R A N T MUST L A S T F O R 30 W E E K S - N O T
J U S T 10.
