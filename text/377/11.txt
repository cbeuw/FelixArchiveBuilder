Royal Philharmonic Orchestra:
Orchestral Tubular Bells (Virgin).
I DO N O T know who David Bedford i s ,
but quite frankly I do not rate him highly
as an orchestral arranger. The reason why
this album i s s o bitterly disappointing is
npt due to the fact that an orchestra was
usea (no, that idea s t i l l remains a very
good one), but more because the orchest-
ration is too weak-kneed at the crucial
R E C O R D S Jack L l e w e l l y n
points of this now-legendary piece of
music. The c r i s p n e s s and langorous
resonance of Mike Oldfield* s original is
lost to i n s i p i d strings, brazen brass, overr
elegant woodwind and an enthusiastic
bass drum.
The first major climax in the work
(early on side one) i s pretty embarassing.
The balance of the melodic lines so-easily
attained in an electronic recording studio
is nowhere to be seen as the bass drum
thrashes around knocking a l l the other
parts to o b l i v i o n .
There i s no sharp contrast of orchest-
ration to hold together the end of s i d e one
like the original does with the grand piano,
mandolin, glockenspiel etc; there is just
what appears to be the same motif repeat-
ed again and again - thus defining an
a l l time low in monotony.
All this record achieves is to make one
more appreciative of the original 'Bells'.

R C S ' s answer to
G u i l d s ' W.H.O.. the dreaded
'Black Hole' struck on Friday
afternoon. S i x pretty red a n d
white shields prepared for the
C i t y a n d G u i l d s Dinner and
Dance disappeared from the
J C R .
The C & G president com-
mented that the action w a s
"petty, especially as these
functions benefit the whole
college. The decorations are
very important''

"How about having three
games in one studio session as
opposed to just two?" we asked
Bamber Gasgoigne . H i s reply
plumbed the depths of banality:
"We never thought of that" .
By that time however, these
were no questions left. B u t to
his credit, on hearing that the
party we had been promised had
been c a n c e l l e d , Bamber did sug-
gest a beer kitty for us. The
nasty producer refused.
We tried hard to smile but
succeeded only i n snarling . So
we zonked the studio with a
Hey Vivol with 'Mike' h e l d aloft,
adjourned to the bar and even-
tually returned to London .
C R O S S C O U N T R Y
Wednesday the 29th January
was, for hose that had for-
gotten, wet. Indeed the fixture
agains Royal Vets and L S E
(again...) could be aptly en-
titled " A p r e s Parliament H i l l
le d e l u g e " . Nobody was able
to avoid the dampening effects
of good de* muddy fields,
ploughed by man and cattle,
but most managed to avoid
straying from the course at
the point where a stream was
washing i t away. Not so R i c h
Harrington who proceeded to
determine the depth of the
stream the hard way - on re-
surfacing he claimed it to be
about 4ft deep.
Despite the hostile terrain,
Rob A l l i n s o n , Steve Webb and
Jan E l l i s finished 1st, 4th
and 5th to take, outright vic-
tory from V e t s , w h i l s t Oaul
C l a r k e , Dave Houlbrook and
P e t e Johnson brought the
second team in third ahead of
the London School of Kotftix
remnants;
Saturdays ' 2!4 mile road
relay at Newlands Park was
altogether a drier affair. It
began as an exercise in i n -
tuitive navigation — we didn't
bring any maps, j u s t a few
directions — and communic-
ation — we had to hail many
natives of Chalfont St -
something — or — other for
further advice . D a v e Payne
a l s o demonstrated an amus-
ing rolling down h i l l start,
to the chagrin o f the Cortina
driver behind us (sorry
missus!). Although previous
visitors to Newlands had
been asserting that i t was
" j u s t round the next b e n d "
for some time, i t wasn't till
we came across tracksuited
individuals and the youths
race, that this optimism was
j u s t i f i e d .
From what we could gat-
her from the results, we were
perhaps the only college
teams competing and good
performances a l l round helped
the first team to 20th place
out of a field o f 37. Due to
ineffient organization the
position of the second team
remains indeterminate but
about 30th. Organizational
mange a l s o struck at the i n -
dividual lap times later in the
race w h i c h are only accurate
to plus or minus several hand-
fulls of salt or minutes for
what its worth the first team
results, subject to official
corruption, were: J a n E l l i s
(14.54), P a u l C l a r k e (14.52),
Dave Jones (14.05), N e i l
B o a g (16.43), R i c h Harrington
(18.10), John Schearer
(13.25!!)
T e a was enlivened by a
young lady (lady?) n i c k i n g a
plate of cakes off our table
without so much as a " b y
your l e a v e " and the journey
back by P a d s expertise with
a one-armed bandit. Incident-
ly R o b was at th"e B U S F ,
Steve a t Twickenham and
refreshment on the return
journey was by Youngs.

Who beat I.C. extra l s t s -
was i t the D & D , was it the rot
gut they serve in the union bar
was it the fact that we were
p l a y i n g in the morning or was
it the opposition?
Fifteen players most of
whom were s t i l l p i s s e d arrived
at Harlington to play Sidcup .
The journey to the ground was
made enjoyable by playing that
popular game " w h o wants to
play s c r u m h a l f " . J . Rose at fly
half seemed to be the only per-
son not enjoying the game.
R . J o n e s won the game and
N . H i c k i n g potted the now
vacant hooker p o s i t i o n .
The first minute nearly
provided an opening try for
S. Chudy who having k i c k e d on,
charged down the full backs
clearance attempt but decided
to have a lie down and rest i n -
stead o f scoring. D a i s y Duck-
ham, twice tried a similar pro-
cedure in the afternoon. I C .
spent most of the first half in
attack but on going back into
their own 25 allowed sidcup to
get a drop goal. I.C. were un-
lucky not to score a couple of
times with M . K i l b r i d e having a
good game. A penalty more i n
which S . C h u d y broke through
before giving stone extra Jones
the ball which was then taken
by A . Ride who made good
ground before p a s s i n g to C
Whiteley. C h r i s ' s excuse for
not scoring was that he was
flattened by four o f the opposi-
tion while 5 yeards from the
l i n e .
H a l f time I.C. 0 Sidcup 3 .
The second haTf started
after the capt., echoed by R .
'ones, had tongue-lashed the
extra l s t s .
P l a y improved and the game
flowed back and forth with
breaks by several o f the I . C .
players not leading to tries
either due to lack of support or
not very clever p a s s i n g (I
thought S. L a d l e had hands on
h i s feet). Sidcup got a try to
increase their lead and notes o f
sarcasm began, to creep into
the c a p t a i n s v o i c e . M . Ranson
scored in the corner after some
excellent running by the I . C .
ream and some good rucking
play (which had not shown i t -
self in the 1st half). 7 . 4 for
S i d c u p .
A try-saving tackle (don't
care i f the ball touched the line)
stopped Sidcup increasing the
score, and at times 8 . & looked
as though they might yet w i n
this game. A good game to win
but a l a s we lost,
7 - 4 to Sidcup.
No. D & D ' s next week so lets
have another w i n .
