ON F R I D A Y , 31st January, C i t y and G u i l d s Union wrote a
letter to the Cambourne School of Mines offering to s e l l Davey
(the R S M U mascot) for £50 . A t the same time, a copy of this
letter was sent to John Mortimer, the R S M U President .
The following Monday, 3rd
February, the C i t y and G u i l d s
Union received two letters that
contradicted each other. It
was decided that one of the
letters was a fake and after
some scrutiny, it was agreed
which one of the two it w a s .
The fake letter contained a
telephone number and a name,
Andy B e c k , whom C & G U were
to contact in order to s e l l the
mascot.
Andy B e c k was contacted
at the given phone number and
a meeting was arranged to be
h e l d at 4 . 0 0 p . m . on Wednesday
5th February, to exchange
Davey for the agreed s u m .
However, on Wednesday
morning, C & G U made a wooden
replica which looked just l i k e
the real thing and f i l l e d it with
wet sand.
The said meeting took
place at the agreed time and
the replica was exchanged for
£50. It h a s s i n c e come to
light that this person, Andy
B e c k , w a s i n fact a c t i n g on
instructions from R S M U (as
C & G U had suspected), although
he i s not a member o f R S M .
It would thus appear that
R S M U now have a "Wooden
Davey" and they a r e £50 the
poorer for i t , whereas C & G U
s t i l l have the original D a v e y .
W h e n T h e T w o E n d s O f T h e
P O L I T I C A L S P E C T R U M
Meet
Y E S T E R D A Y T H E R E was a confrontation between the N a t i o n a l
Front and a l l the left of centre p o l i t i c a l groups a t I C . T h i s
followed an attempt by the N F to book a room under the a u s p i c e s
of the Young S o c i a l i s t Student Society for 1 p.m. yesterday.
However the booking was revok-
ed and an open meeti ng of the
external affairs committee w a s
c a l l e d in its stead. However the
National Front ( N F ) d i d n o t
agree that their meeting h a d
been cancelled.
So 12.30pm saw a large gat-
hering i n the front entrance to
Mech. E n g . waiting for devel-
opements. T h e N F and S o c i a l -
ists were both there distributing
opposing literature. A l s o pre-
sent were the college authorit-
ies, and the p o l i c e who were
"observing a NF march from the
V&A"
When Stoic filmed the scene
the s o c i a l i s t s burst into a chant
of "National Front - Nazi
Front". A l s o "what are you go-
ing to do with the blacks?" T o
which N F replied "kick them
out." T h e N F placards (small
pieces of cardboard box) read:
"Don't be bullied by commun-
ist thugs", "National Front
puts Britain First", "Stand Up
for Democracy", "Stand Up for
Free Speech."
I C U President, Trevor P h i l -
lips then asked that the assem-
bly move into Room 342 to be-
gin the meeting on how to op-
pose fascism , c a l l e d by I C
external affairs committee.
The open meeting was then
held, no-one being denied entry.
