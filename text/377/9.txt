Dear Sir,
Since only ten of a total
of some 70 student editors
were-represented at the meet-
ing which you reported on
your front page l a s t week,
under the headline 'Sennet
under Pressure' the idea that
the meeting was speaking on
behalf of 'The London
Student Newspapers' i s with-
out foundation.
Sennet is a weekly paper
for London students. It has a
print run of 40,000 copies
and it is distributed to over
100 c o l l e g e s in the Greater
London area. We estimate
that on average each copy i s
read by 2.5 people. T h i s i s
standard practice used by
national newspapers to e s t i -
mate not c i r c u l a t i o n as you
reported but readership.
Sennet admits to having a
few distribution problems in
at the most three or four c o l -
leges in the Greater London
area. These problems arise
in some cases from action
taken by i n d i v i d u a l s , without
any mandate from their U n i o n
to disrupt the distribution of
Sennet for their own personal
reasons. Nevertheless, de-
mand for the paper i s i n -
creasing steadily as more
colleges are requesting to be
put on the delivery round.
Yours faithfully,

Monsieur,
Regarding the article "T.M.
Soc. and Student Life", F E L I X
readers might be interested to
know how much the members
have improved their personal re-
lationships through profound
meditation. E v e n taking into
consideration the unnatural boy
/girl ratio at I.C. it i s s t i l l
very difficult to appreciate the
c a v e man approach which seems
to be a dominant feature of the
T . M . boy!
We feel it is our duty to warn
any unsuspecting females (and
p o s s i b l y some males), of the
members' aggressive behaviour
which we are sure is merely due
to their wretched frustation.
We sincerely hope that we
have not offended any of the
young ones concerned, but we
thought we should play our part,
however small, in helping them
achieve their final goal ...

Dear Sir,
It i s now common knowledge
within Imperial College that the
floating s a b b a t i c a l (ie. the
F e l i x Editor) i s causing a big
rift i n I . C . U . E x e c u t i v e .
After last w e e k ' s catast-
rophic i s s u e of F e l i x , it would
not take the students of I.C.
long to realise that F e l i x i s not
a l l that necessary and that the
sabbatical post for the F e l i x
editor should be abolished.
I realise that your vari-
typist was i l l on the Monday
but as E d i t o r , you should be
able to operate the varitype-
writer. I, as Guiidsheet Editor,
am capable of operating every
piece of equipment used in the
production of G u i i d s h e e t due to
any of my helpers being i l l or
busy elsewhere when I want to
publish Guiidsheet. Y o u have
been at the post for five months
now and do not know how to
operate this machine. What have
you been doing in your office for
thepast five months?
L e t ' s not have a dead cat on
our hands. Get that c a t a l y s t out
and cater for the students of
I.C. rather than catapult F e l i x
into a catacomb since the only
reminder would be catguts, or
are you already using the cat-
guts for your fiddle strings.
Yours sincerely,
D R U

Dear Sir,
It was with much displeasure
that I heard of the decision to
produce no Mag for 75/76. Not
only was this a blow to myself
and my contemporaries, but it
was a blow to the great name of
Democracy - a name held in
great esteem by we humble sub-
editors: In an effort to make
right the wrongs of a small-min-
ded, money-grabbing, dictator-
i a l minority, I feel obliged to
encourage the nice people at
I . C . to make their disgust at the
d e c i s i o n known (I have several
hangman k i t s , and even Johnny
Sevens, at my disposal).
Yours truely,
Martin J o n e s (Drippy).

Dear Sir,
When I was informed of the
recent d e c i s i o n to a b o l i s h R a g
Mag 75' I was stunned, quote:
"bloody hell, what do they
think there playing at." H a v i n g
recovered sufficiently and after
several brandies and dry ginger
I decided to take an active
role i n correcting this d e c i s i o n ;
reason being that I hope to be
editor of the aforementioned
magazine.
One main excuse for not
having a mag is that its not
financially viable and there's
u s u a l l y lots of left overs!'
Well a l l you people who want a
75 edition help s e l l the 74
edition, and a l s o inform your
V P of your consternation over
the rag mag banning - hope-
fully someone somewhere can
rectify this d e c i s i o n of the
I . C . C . C .
Yours faithfully
J . I . Johnston.
