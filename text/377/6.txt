on Jacqui Gerrard
A n d y W a t s o n
The H o n . Sec. i s a pleasant sort o f
person, with a n a i r o f conficence a n d
competence. She sat with a polite smile on
her face while I bumbled around getting
coffee from the refectory counter, slopping
it i n the saucers, dropping cigarette ash
in i t , a n d forgetting spoons. S h e even
laughed when part way through the inter-
view I discovered I hadn't turned on the
tape recorder.
'I'm a very ordered person', she told me,
'Not tidy perhaps but methodical'. Admirable
qualities in a secretary.
We talked about her job. T h e p o s i t i o n
which Jacqui holds entails a great d e a l o f
day-to-day running o f U n i o n affiars â€”
organisation of office paper work; taking
the minutes at c o u n c i l , executive and other
meetings; posting nomination papers and
general running of e l e c t i o n s .
'I'm quite fully occupied just keeping
things ticking over, and in addition I feel
I ought to do something more positive,
compiling a document detailing council
decisions since 1962, for instance, which
has meant that the obsolete policies can
be revised'.
What, I wondered, was a n i c e girl l i k e
her doing at a college l i k e this? A youthful
love for science seems to have h a d some-
thing to do with i t . A t school she had
sacrifioed every Saturday morning for two
years for the p r i v i l e g e of taking 0 l e v e l
p h y s i c s . She came to I C because i t was
one o f the few colleges i n the country
where she could study pure mathematics,
'Fool as 1 was, 1 thought I'd enjoyed
it'. She has since seen the error of her
ways and intends to steer herself i n a
more practical direction.
Both J a c q u i ' s career i n student p o l i t i c s
and her marriage to B i l l Gerrard, came
about a s a result of her first R C S union
meeting.
'He was just retiring as president of
RCSU. I met him there, and things sort of
progressed from that point, as it were'.
(Obviously, there are unlooked-for a d -
vantages i n being a 'somebody' i n the
C C U ' s ! ) .
Jacqui spends most o f her spare time
with friends from the college.
'In general I'm not a disco/concert
goer, 'nor have I a minority interest, like
folk or jazz. My social activity is chatting
to people, going to parties and that sort of
thing. There's plenty of social life in the
college but most it*iU*ts don't use it.
They prefer, like me, to do other things,
or they live too far out, or they're too busy
working'. E s p e c i a l l y that they are too
busy working. A t another point s h e e x -
pressed the opinion that a random sampling
of the men at I C would show that a l l that
most of them want to do i s sit and study.
She i s aware too, that the majority o f
students are not interested i n the running
of the U n i o n . A s we were leaving s h e
showed me the notice board where she had
pinned nomination papers for several posts
including the delegates to the forthcoming
National Conference. Sure enough, not one
name was on any of the papers.

Speaker: D r . W e n d y G r e e n g r o s s
F O R A N institution which has come under heavy fire from
extremists recently, marriage s t i l l appears to be as perky, fash-
ionable and, in some form or other, necessary a s it ever has been.
L a s t weekend's Touchstone d i s c u s s i o n c l e a r l y came to that gen-
eral c o n c l u s i o n and it was further felt that in order for society to
survive in any recognisable
form, then the one-to-one
marriage partnership w i l l be of
primary importance.
The speaker was leading
gynaecologist and radio broad-
c a s t e r Dr.Wendy Greengross,
who introduced the subject with
a brief introduced
a brief survey of the historical
motivations a s s o c i a t e d with
marriage. She continued by
sharply contrasting these with
present-day motivations w h i l s t
deftly explaining the relation-
s h i p between s o c i a l attitudes
and the h i s t o r i c a l environment,
which was responsible for such
a c o n t r a s t .
There once was a day when
the family was the s o c i a l unit.
The father was the provider who
financed the home and the
c h i l d r e n ' s education, who was
the head of the family, took a l l
the major decisions and wielded
absolute authority. The mother
cooked, sewed, brought the c h i -
ldren up and was an internal
part of the household. Marriage
w a s a socio-economic necessity
and few could really manage
without it .Sex was enjoyed by
men, suffered by women and
that was the end of i t .
Today, however, with the a d -
vent ot suffrage, s o c i a l s e c -
urity, contraception, state edu-
c a t i o n , the emancipated woman,
convenience foods and labour
s a v i n g household gadgets the
deployment of a family's res-
p o n s i b i l i t i e s i s no longer clear
cut and the father's authority a s
the sole provider has been
seriously eroded.
A s a result the economic
aspect of marriage has been
diminished and this i s believed
to be an important factor when
considering why a couple w i l l
prefer to get a divorce rather
than fight to save the marriage.
The divorce rate is quite
startlingt there are about
425,000 marriages per y e a r . Out
of these, 111,000 end in divorce
s o the actual divorce rate i s
about one in four.
T h i s , in Dr. Greengross's
opinion, has led to the unfort-
unate attitude that the institu-
tion of marriage i s being under-
valued: some people would pre-
fer divorce rather than work for
the marriage.
Throughout the d i s c u s s s i o n
weekend various points were
made which demand mention:
P o s i t i v e education for marriage
would probably prove to be
fruitless - elimination of ident-
ifiable prejudices would be pre-
ferable. Marriage i s putting up

with the bad points of the other
partner. Infatuation i s the a s -
sertion of an ideal image on
someone. Love is more e a s i l y
recognised than defined but
e s s e n t i a l l y love in marriage is
a kind of initial passion w h i c h
mellows into a tasting friend-
s h i p .
Alternative forms of marriage
were briefly d i s c u s s e d including
homosexual group and communal
relationships. Dr Greengross
was clear in her opinion when
she s a i d that one in every four
people i s doomed to be a d i v -

opening up new options for pro-
spective candidates for the

The last word on marriage
was "You've got to work hard
at it!".
