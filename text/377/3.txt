At Home with the Gibbers.
There are few things more rewarding in life than to be able to
understand someone e l s e s G i b b e r i s h - From the moment you d i s -
cover that a Coup de grace isn't lawnmower and mal de rier is not
in fact mother-in-law, a whole new world opens out. Those 50
m i l l i o n people across the Channel making funny shapes and
sounds with their mouth actually
sounds with their mouth act-
ually make sense! There is
something more to it than plume
de ma tarte after a l l ! Having
mastered the fringo lingo noth-
ing remains but to add a vowel
to the end of every word and
the Italians get the hang of it
too, practise that fast enough
and y o u are ready to take on
spain -.nay, the whole world
is at your pied ( F O O T , dear -
foot).
Of course one's approach to
language depends on one's own
nationality . T h e Englishman
has the imperious attitude that
if he shouts loud and long
enough he is bound to be under-
stood sooner or later and for
him the most damning c r i t i c i s m
of a l l is " t h e fellow can't even
speak E n g l i s h " w h i c h doesn't
mean that the poor chap is not
gifted in l i n g u i s t i c s but that he
is a pig-headed bore with a
brain the s i z e of an under-ripe
walnut and about a s much sense
a s a n ostrich with the wind up
its feathers.
The American, who at an
early age spread the vicious
rumour that he spoke E n g l i s h ,
is the only person to use two
hundred variations of the lang-
uage without mastering none.
(Hold it - I'm a reformed C a n a -
dian and some of my best friend
dian and some of my best
friends are Yanks), T h e
American abroad favours the
staccato straddle method of
communication which involves
spreading h i s words like he was
spreadin' margarine boy, sep-
rated by wat yer might c a l l
STRANGE THOUGH it may
seem, the ancient land of
Persia is shaped like a cat.
However, this in no way affe-
cted Soudabeh Majidi's deci-
sion to pose for this picture
in Princes's Gardens .Soudi
actually comes from Tehran
and is in her second year of
studying chemistry. One of her
main activities outside her
subject is transcendental med-
itation: "It's very relaxing".
She stunned us all when
she said "I think printing pic-,
tures of girls on page 3 is
pointless."
Ah, we said benignly, we
get the point though!

ICWA
JUL IA DUNNING
I F E E L I S H O U L D draw the attention a l l ICWA members to a
new movement developing w i t h i n the A s s o c i a t i o n . F o r the s i x t y
odd years of i t ' s existence, ICWA has for the most part been a
non-political s o c i a l body.
It may be argued that this is
how it should stay for the next
sixty years but the basis of life
is change .So therefore should
ICWA change.
On Wednesday, January 29th
a meeting was held in the ICWA
lounge. It's object - to d i s c u s s
the feasibility and p o s s i b l e
support of a Women in Science
group within I.C. About thirty
women came and there ensued
what I feel was not only a worth
while exchange of ideas, but
what w a s for me quite an e n -
lightening experience.
A s President of the A s s o c -
iation, and a l s o a 3rd year
student with finals looming
closer every day, I have very
little spare time. T h e suggest-
ion of bringing ICWA more
directly into investigating pro-
blems both academic and s o c i a l
of the students in the college
has been put to me on a num-
ber of o c c a s i o n s . My reply has
always been that I have neither
the time,nor, I had assumed, the
support for such a c t i v i t i e s .
I s t i l l do not have a great
deal of spare time but the sup-
port is undoubtedly there.
The idea of setting up the
group w a s suggested by Karen
Gadd, a second year student in
Mechanical Engineering. I
agreed to give my support to the
arranging of the meeting and
a l s o to introduce it.
What ensued w a s a general
d i s c u s s i o n of the ideas Karen
had for the group and other
ideas were soon forthcoming
from the floor. A t the end of the
meeting a number of sugges-
tions had been put forward.
Some of these briefly were:-
1. To set up a Women in
Science group within and
financed by ICWA, but even
so as a relatively separate
group .
2. That the purpose of such a
group should encompass
academic and social pro-
blems of all students, but
particularly of the women at
I.C.; also that it should in-
vestigate means of encour-
aging in the schools and in
general outside of college
into science careers.
3. A survey should be made of
all the departments in I.C.
by a student body, such as
Women in Science, with the
view to producing a docu-
ment on the social and
academic facilities of each
department, particularly
giving it's views on women
students. This document
should then be presented at
the annual meeting of car-
eers masters in I.C.during
the Easter vacation (this is
arranged by the Admissions
Policy people). A /so, the
possibility could then brise
of printing this document in
the college prospectus.
It was a l s o decided that for
the time being the group should
meet every Wednesday lunch-
time in the ICWA lounge and
invite along a series of guest
s p e a k e r s . W i t h this in mind, I
am c a l l i n g a General Meeting
on Wednesday, the 12th of
February at 12.30p.m . in the
ICWA lounge.
P l e a s e come along, a s to-
gether with the meeting of the
Women in Science group, I feel
a number of items should be
d i s c u s s e d by a well represent-
ed number of lewarians with a
wide spectrum of v i e w s . The
meeting w i l l include a talk by
me on the forthcoming ICWA
elections and a l s o on possible
future changes in the constitu-
tion of ICWA.
l-o-n-g p a u s e s . Rescue an
American abroad from a near
verbal disaster and he w i l l look
at you a s if you might grow an
extra head to house the extra
tongue. Moreover in P a r i s , he
w i l l insist on c a l l i n g over the
'garcon' which, invariably pro-
nounced with a hard ' c ' sounds
more a s if h e ' s c a l l i n g for some
sort of p i c k l e .
However the obvious answer
to a l l these problems is to have
an instant translation machine -
a Mirqual Linqual might be an
appropriate name. Meanwhile
here are a few hardy phrases to
get you out of any tricky s i t -
uation:
Au contraire (away for the
weekend)
C'est-a-dire (she's a honey)
Faux pas (father-in-law)
Carte Blanche (for God's sake,
take Blanche home!)
