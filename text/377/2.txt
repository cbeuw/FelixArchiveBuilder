T H E A N N O U N C E M E N T in Beaver,
the L S E Students' newspaper, that
Trevor P h i l l i p s i s to stand on the offic-
i a l Broad L e f t platform for one of the
four posts of vice-president N U S comes
a s no surprise to me. A n d i t would come
as even l e s s of a surprise were it to be
announced that our president would be
standing for U L U president, a post
which the Broad L e f t shackled onto last
year with John Carr, Trevor's now -
c l o s e a s s o c i a t e .
Having followed Trevor's "rise to
power" from its infancy when we were
together as first-year chemists, it has
been easy to predict h i s next move after
I C U president. It is hoped, however, that
the time spent on his extensive activit-
ies in ULU in no way contributed to the
call for the third sabbatical to be shifted
to the union central administration be-
cause of the overload of IC union work .
If this i s not so, let me retract the idea;
if it is correct, however, may I be the
first to express my disgust.
In the event that Trevor does become
U L U president, I sincerely hope that he
does not forget the £1 wager that we
struck sometime last September .

Regarding the letter from Dru Brown,
the Guiidsheet Editor, may I say, D r u ,
that your naivity astounds me. I am most
envious that you are capable of operating
every piece of equipment i n the production
of Guiidsheet. Y o u must forgive me for
not having the time to serve a five-year
apprenticeship before operating the offset
iitho machine . I am perfectly capable of
operating the £2,000's worth of vari-
typer, but you must forgive me further for
not attempting to operate i t when it had
mechanical faults (the mechanic had to
c a l l twice that particular week ).

Strange that i t should be Sennet
a c c u s i n g the F E L I X Board of making a
statement without foundation (Letters,
page 9). Thirteen papers represented out
of a total of fifty or s o does not negate
the fact that the opinion o f the meeting
was practically unanimous. Several
papers could not make the meeting, but
over the phone they concurred with the
meeting's opinion. A l s o , it i s quite clear
national newspapers are w i d e l y read in
families, hotels, clubs etc and s o they
can c l a i m an easy average o f 2 5 readers
oer copy. But can Sennet?

Sir,
I must thank Steve Brady
for attempting to begin a debate
at the National Front in the last
edition of F E L I X . It i s about
time that page 2 was occupied
by something rather more serious
and worthwhile than the
pettiness which h a s charact-
erised i t this term (Hear, hear! —
Ed.).
However, I take i s s u e with
virtually every point that h e
raised. Space does not permit an
answer to a l l of them, but I w i l l
take up the major pieces of
nonsense.
To suggest that I know
nothing of the N a t i o n a l F r o n t ' s
p o l i c i e s i s quite incorrect, I
have taken, a very strong
interest i n B r i t i s h fascism for
some time; my interest w a s
further stimulated by two
incidents. About eighteen months
ago, i t became known to me that
I was a National Front 'target'
in Manchester. T h i s news w a s
confirmed when an attempt w a s
made by some thugs c l a i m i n g to
be a s s o c i a t e d with the N F , to
'get me', i . e . beat the hell out
of me. Fortunately, I escaped
and the N F h a s disappeared
from that city since.
Your comparison of the N F
with 'nationalist movements' of
A f r i c a i s quite spurious. A l l
the movements which could
p o s s i b l y fall under that heading
were fighting against domination
from abroad. They were battling
c o l o n i a l i s m , a n d were pitted
against a n enemy which w a s
far more powerful than they i n
material terms, since i t totally
controlled the c o l o n i a l economy.
They fought an enemy which had
imposed i t s w i l l by force of
arms for centuries. Who i s the
N F fighting? A handful of bus-
rlifts
conductors, road-sweepers,
housewives, unemployed youths,
shopkeepers and students. C a n
this handful be compared to the
colonial armies deployed against
the passive resistance o f
Gandhi or the constitutional
protest o f Nyerere i n T a n -
ganyika?
Today a number of liberation
movements fight i n A f r i c a . I do
not support a l l , or even many of
them, a s Steve Brady implied.
I support those who have fought
for genuinely progressive
p o l i c i e s , who w i l l work for
peace a n d freedom for their
people. I can name s p e c i f i c a l l y ,
the two Portuguese movements
P A I G C in Guine, and F R E L I M O
i n Mozambique. I reject those
movements which seek to impose
any kink o f domination over their
people, for example, the
a s s o c i a t e s of Idi A m i n .
With respect to the N F ' s
attitude towards i J e w s , I would
point out that most of the N F ' s
present leaders, including
T y n d a l l a n d Webster were
a s s o c i a t e d with C o l i n Jordon
for many years, and echoed the
vile anti-Jewish filth which he
spewed forth. E x a m p l e : 'The
Jew is a poisonous maggot
feeding on a body in an advanced
state of decay' - John T y n d a l l ,
founder and Director of the N F .
My comments on the use o f
the R a c e Relations A c t are not
original. T h i s U n i o n has itself
pledged support for any 'peaceful
action' against racism. I
interpret the u s e of the A c t ,
introduced to protect a l l parts
of the population from u n -
necessary a n d racist victim-
isation and insult, a s peaceful
action. If the N F i s not getting
at people just because of their
colour, then no problems should
arise.
I certainly do not prevent
the N F from putting out bumph.
However, Mr.Brady w i l l know it
i s a d i s c i p l i n a r y offence to put
up any stickers on w a l l s i n

has, however, appeared. P l e a s e
d e s i s t , Mr.Brady, or the
E x e c u t i v e (multi-racial a s it i s )
w i l l have to consider what
action c a n be taken to combat
this. B y the w a y , I assume
Mr.Brady objects to my being
elected, democratically (like
L o r d P i t t ) to 'a position of
power'. If s o , w i l l he (dem-
ocratically) challenge the right
of the I C electorate, a n d tell
the 900 students who voted for
me last year that they had no
right to do s o because I am not

P . S . It i s instructive to note
that the N F ' s arguments about
immigrants (depriving the
' B r i t i s h of jobs, h o u s e s , e t c ) ,
have been used against the
Irish for centuries. Will you go
home, Mr.Brady ?

Sir,
A s I s a t i n my l o c a l last
night drinking my "OLD BOG"
XXX SPECIAL, i t suddenly
occured to me that there must
be many other students at I C
who share my taste for a l l
wonderful beers that E n g l a n d ' s
green and pleasant land has to
offer us a l l . With this i n mind I
should l i k e to u s e your organ
(i) to appeal for support in
forming a REAL ALE SOCIETY
in the C o l l e g e . Our objectives
might be
-to go boozing both near and
far, Youngs, Marstons, Samuel
Smiths, Shepherd Neame etc are
available within spitting
distance of I C a n d perhaps
Adnams, Boddingtons, Hartleys
etc would come within easy
reach, given a little
o r g a n i z a t i o n .
