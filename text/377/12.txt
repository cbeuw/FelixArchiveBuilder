was the c a l l echoed around the
union lower lounge following
the F r o g ' s formation of his
final first fifteen on Friday for
the forthcoming fixture with a
first-class reserve side
Saracens E x t r a s .
Knowing the coach was due
to leave at 9.15 a.m . Gez F l e m
bag decided he had better get
out o f bed at 9.20 a j n . there-
by being 15 minutes late and
hence on t i m e . A t this stage
the coach driver was w a i t i n g
very w e l l which was to prove a
valuable a s s e t on the way
back.
Arriving on time a t the
ground, a very ominous sign,
thirty players gathered on the
pitch to take part i n what can
only be described a s a s i x t y -
eight point thriller. T e n minu-
tes into the first half a player
from the base of. a maul threw
the ball to the first player o f a
w e l l positioned line of players
T h i s player p a s s e d the ball to
the next player who was badly
tackled by another player,
a l l o w i n g that player to break
through the players i n the cen-
tre and send the player outside
him over the line. The game
continued i n this fascinatine
manner. The high standard
could only be accounted for by
teamwork and d i s c i p l i n e , the
sort doctors prefer.
The game now finally over
the first fifteen found that they
had approximately five minutes
to e a t their meal and sneak
aound for the usual two or three
extra helpings. A t five to one
the coach driver thinking he
should have left a t 12.30 dec-
ided to wait w e l l for another
five minutes. H e even told two
people already on the coach
that h e had made h i s own
daughter walk five miles be-
cause she had been sick a l l
over h i s care. Well with such a
tough line attitude everybody
eventually climbed i n the coach
with sausages and rolls poking
out at every angle from our
mouths.
