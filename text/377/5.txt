R u p e r t H a r p e r
The latest on the garage/
workshop; I went to s e e Prof
Ford the other day and he
liked the idea, s o things are
looking quite rosy there. I
shall keep you informed, I
should like to point out that
a l l the G u i l d s Motor C l u b
not just the B i k e section w i l l
be able to use the f a c i l i t i e s .
At the moment the policy on
tools i s that you provide your
own, there is some demand to
get a'torgue wrench, but they
are costly and if w e do get one
some measures to protect it
from theft and damage, big
deposits, spring to m i n d . I
would not be keen to lend out
such a tool if I had one s o it is
not unreasonable to expect the
Motor C l u b to jealously guard i t .
Now it looks a s though a M / C
lending library w i l l be started
shortly, in order to borrow a
book or magazine you w i l l have
to leave your motor club mem-
bership card with the librarian,
who shall be me, for starters
we shall try for " B i k e " and
" M o t o r C y c l e N e w s " and per-
haps a few books depending on
suggestions, we might a l s o get
" E a s y R i d e r " which I gather
is quite popular.
Many people have asked me
what the Imperial C o l l e g e
Sporting M : C C l u b i s about, let
me explain , M/C enthusiasts
can be loosly divided into two
categories, those interested in
their own road going machines,
and require f a c i l i t i e s for re-
building and modifying their
machines, such as myself, and
the second category whose
main interest is competition,
and wish to become a c t i v e l y
involved in racing, t r i a l i n g a n d
such like. 9bviously quite a lot
of people fit into both categ-
ories. T h e G u i l d s section caters
fir the former group and the I . C .
club for the latter, and I expect
their w i l l be quite a lot of
people who w i l l be members of
both. But there i s a definite
need for both. I gather the I.C.
club are thinking of going
marshalling, s o you are not
adverse to trying to find a body
in a pile of bent machinery arid
blood soaked straw bales its
well worth it to be able to stand
in the middle where you get a
much better view of the racing,
and a chance to have a look a t
the machinery. I may well be
going myself sometime.
T h a t ' s about a l l I can think
of to bore you with s o I ' l l
finish, seeya.
