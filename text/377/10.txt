France however offers the
least resistance to the for-
eigner. There is a n amusing
quirk in the French character,
which i s the shame and horror
of the French authorities,
whereby Johnny Onion i n s i s t s
on breaking out intp E n g l i s h
at every possible opportunity
and adopting E n g l i s h words
which are immediately con-
sidered " t r e s s n o b " . In fact,
s o worrying i s this tendency,
that the French have recently
set up a Society for the Pro-
tection of the French Language
and the officials, after ur Don
week-end doing le camping
with the kids and le shopping
with the wife, comes !^ack to
P a r i s by. le car, leave's it at le
parking and dashes off to un
meeting to d i s c u s s the problems
of the French language over un
drink (preferably le Scotch).

£33,000
Strike Fund
T H E R E N T S T R I K E fund at B r i s t o l U n i v e r s i t y has s w o l l e n to
over £33,000. O v p 325 students have paid into the fund; which i s
a 50% better achievement than ever before.
The rent strike i s a protest
on four main i s s u e s :
1. H a l l fees have been increas-
ed twice i n mid s e s s i o n : from
£98-50 to £111-25 i n the second
term and to £116-25 i n the third
term making h a l l fees the high-
est i n the country.
2. There i s a rent freeze on
s e l f catering accomodation
therefore the U n i v e r s i t y cannot
increase rents on th^se.
3. T h e University increased
student House rents, admitting
this was to recover loses made
during the period o f the rent
freeze. T h e Union c l a i m this i s
i l l e g a l a s it i s against
a . the one year contract by
the Union and the Univer-
sity.
b. the provisions o f the rent '
. a c t .
4. While return to original level
of rents i s demanded now the
Union recognise that the only
long term solution i s a n incr-
ease i n the grant to cover ris-
ing accomodation c o s t s .
The University h a s i n fact
given way on point three admit-
ting they were legally i n the
wrong and thanking the U n i o n
for pointing this o u t . Student
House rents are now back to
summer 1974 levels and the
President of the U n i o n , F r a n c i s
Hayden hopes h a l l fees w i l l
soon follow. H e s a i d "Students
are being hit by inflation, but
Students are paying for both;
this just is not equitable."
UGM Report
"THE BEST Union meeting we've had this year" commented
the Hon S e c after this U G M .
The usual b u s i n e s s was dealt with fairly speedily, thus paving
the w a y for d i s c u s s i o n on the five motions on the agenda.
The first motion, on grants and educational cut-backs w a s
overwhelmingly voted through
after some debate. T h e main
points contained i n this motion
being, firstly, that F E c o l l e g e s
were worst hit by the cut-backs
and secondly that education i s
a right . T h e second motion pro-
posed by P a u l Watkins, (the
external
External Affairs Officer) w h i c h
was on the E E C was fiercely
debated with Mr Gerrard speak-
ing against the motion. T h e
essential point was that stud-
ents should vote N O in the com-
ing referendum. Mr Steve Brady
spoke for the motion interpret-
ing i t a s part o f the N F ' s policy.
After a speach against byMarg
Attenborough and a summing.up
by the proposer the motion w a s
defeated by 53 votes to 36.
In h i s speech for the motion
on Education p o l i c y the P r e *
sident said "we should not just
think economistically. The Un-
ion should also pursue a long
term policy on education...
there should be adequate fin-
ancing of education that will be
adequate
beneficial especially in adult
education" .There being no
speech against the motion w a s
c a r r i e d .
Mr Brady challenged the
quorum. T h e challenge w a s up-
held by the chairman, the D e -
puty President.
A meeting of the External
Affairs Committee then moved
into s e s s i o n . A t this point the
D P , R o n K i l l , who was i n the
chair categorically stated that
the meeting would "remain
quorate as long as the ICU
executive and Mr Watkins are
still here".
The President spoke for the
motion on South A f r i c a which
c a l l e d for release of p o l i t i c a l
prisoners in South A f r i c a and
an ending of the i l l e g a l occup-
ation of Namibia (Rho
ation of Namibia by South A f r i -
can p o l i c e . In a very strong
speech for the motion the P r e -
sident s a i d "If the government
I elect pursues policies which
agree with illegal occupation of
Namibia (Rhodesia), apartheid
in South Africa and illegal de-
claration of independence as in
Zimbabwe then that government
is not representative of my
views" . O n the question l i b -
eration movements he said
"/ do not support any and sun-
dry liberation movements ...
what is more important is demo-
cracy, progress and involvement
of people in the government of
themselves - this is not going
on in South Africa or Namibia" .
Mr Brady speaking against said
"If I were a black in South
Africa I would rather be ruled by
a white .. when coloniased
countries are given independ-
ence they usually end up as
dictatorships". T w o amend-
ments were made to the motion
before i t was p a s s e d by a large
majority.
The second of Mr Watkin's
motions and the last on the
sheet w a s on the Government's
economic p o l i c y and after a
speech against by Mr Pete
Teague and a lengthy debate
was p a s s e d by 19 votes to 17 .
The meeting c l o s e d at
approximately 2.30pm .
SLICE
Save
Lighting and
Imperial
College
Energy
Help to SLICE costs by using energy
wisely in the College .In 1975 energy
costs, mainly for heating and electricity,
are estimated to increase by about 50%
over last year. With no increase in the
Government grant to the College, this
means that YOU wilt have to make do with less - facilities
e g. laboratory materials, lecture notes, UNION grant, in
order to pay the increased energy bills.
You can help by:
•Closing all external doors and windows
•Switching off all unnecessary lights
•Using minimum hot water
•Thinking twice before switching on power con-
suming equipment - even if you are doing a
routine experiment.
•Remembering to switch off as soon as you have
finished.
In these ways you can help to SLICE the bills and help
yourself at the same time .
Any suggestions for SLICING energy costs should be
sent to
SLICE c/o Dept .of Electrical Engineering .
