Fire in Southside
When R i c h a r d Ellis, an aeronautics 1 student, saw smoke
billowing out under the door o f a r o o m i n T i z a r d H a l l on
Wednesday m o r n i n g he acted quickly i n raising the a l a r m a n d
evacuating neighbouring r o o m s .
The fire occurred i n r o o m 457, which belongs to Anthony
T h o m p s o n , a Zoology 3 student, a n d is believed to have been
caused by an electrical fault.
R i c h a r d Ellis first smelt smoke on staircase 5 at about 9.45 a m and
saw a small amount of smoke c o m i n g from a level 4 light fitting.
Assuming it was a short circuit he turned off the light and reported it to
the wardens' assistant, M r s . J o Rice.
O n returning to level 4 he noticed that more smoke was coming from
under the door of room 457. Fortunately R i c k Ellis has h a d naval
training in fire fighting and acted quickly. H e checked that nobody was
in the smoke-filled room, secured the fire door and told M r s . R i c e to
dial 999. H e then personally evacuated staircase 5 and checked from a
neighbouring room that the windows were closed.
W h e n College Fire Officer Bob photographic equipment i n the
Foggon arrived he found that the
fire was too b i g for h i m to deal

extinguished the blaze.
As a precautionary measure the
fire alarm was raised to evacuate
Southside. But most residents
ignored the alarm, a n d M r .
Foggon said he was still trying to
get people out of the building 12
minutes after the alarm first
sounded.
T h e fire was contained within
room 457 a n d damage was
estimated at around £700. Most of
the ceiling plaster had fallen
d o w n a n d the room will need
extensive redecoration.
Furniture was destroyed but
A n t h o n y T h o m p s o n said that a
stereo system and £500 worth of
room were only stained.

everything h a d been done to
make Southside as safe as possible.
But some residents and cleaners
engage i n the dangerous practice
of wedging the doors open a n d
M r . Foggon is constantly having
to remove the wedges.
T h e r e is a full i n t e r i o r
signposting system to direct
residents to the nearest means of
escape from the building.
Also notices i n four languages
are to be placed in all bedrooms
telling residents what action to
take in the event of a fire.
M r . Foggon wishes to express
his thanks a n d appreciation to
R i c h a r d Ellis lor the prompt
action he took in dealing with the
fire.

It looks like there will be no new refectory boycott for the
time being following the G o v e r n o r s ' decision not to remove
Refectory Committee's power to fix prices.
A n d Chris Fox, R C S U President and one of the student observers at
the Governors' meeting, summed u p the result as 2:1 to the students.
T h e College Finance and Executive Committee meeting last Friday
was to discuss a proposal by the Rector to hand over a l l pricing
decisions to the Domestic Secretary, Capt. J . W . G . Lindley, and
Refectory Committee C h a i r m a n Prof. Eilon.
But after it became clear that there was a lot of opposition the Rector
did not put his proposal to the meeting.

Instead the Governors decided that termly price reviews by
Refectory Committee, on which students have six representatives,
should continue a n d recommended that the Committee consider
overall pricing policy rather than just put u p prices to balance the
accounts.
T h e Governors also decided that the use of the regulator to up
refectory prices in line with inflation should continue a n d should
include increased costs other than food.
U n i o n President M a r y Attenborough said that the Governors'
decision was better than she expected and welcomed their confirmation
of the right of consumer representatives to have a say in pricing policy.
She was disappointed at the recommendation that the regulator should
not be limited to compensating for food price inflation.
