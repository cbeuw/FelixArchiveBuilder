Despite the bitterly cold
weather, not to mention 2nd
term apathy, 39 people braved
the cold to come out and
collect for Jerome Canvin's
'Phonic Ear' on Saturday.
Early on it didn't look very
hopeful, but once again our
dedicated collectors proved
themselves, the total now
stands at 810 pounds, (with
two cans still to be counted),
more than enough to buy the
aid.
Many thanks to all who turned
up, to collect, count money, or
even just donate. The top
collectors were Zosia Zbrzezniak
(who'd have guessed it...) with
over 217 pounds and PeteHewkin
with over 90 pounds, closely
followed by Dale Howard, Katy
Tatchell and Tansy Hepton. Life
Sciences were the top department
(not counting Chemistry who've
got the advantage of Zosia), but
the barrel will be shared by all
who came (date not decided yet).
I'd also like to thank the half dozen
Guildsmen (and women) who
came along and collected about
80 pounds between them.
Thank you again for this
tremendous response, and I hope
you'll be able to meet Jerome
when he comes up for a
presentation of the aid.

WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND T E C H N O L O G Y
Every Wednesday lunchtime a group mostly of women meets
in the ICWA Lounge to discuss a variety of topics usually with
an invited speaker.
The group is known as "Women in Science and Technology"
and subjects discussed this term have covered such diverse
themes as the Christian view of women and the position of
women in Latin America.
T h e term started on a s o m e w h a t militant note with a m e e t i n g
on an a s p e c t of the W o m e n ' s L i b e r a t i o n M o v e m e n t at w h i c h the
s p e a k e r c a m e f r o m a m a g a z i n e s o l d strictly o n l y to w o m e n .
T h e f o l l o w i n g w e e k W i S T listened to a s p e a k e r w h o runs a
C h r i s t i a n c o m m u n i t y . S h e s p o k e a b o u t the C h r i s t i a n v i e w p o i n t
w h i c h , she e x p l a i n e d , c o n s i d e r s both men and w o m e n as
p e r s o n s created by G o d in His o w n i m a g e a n d therefore of
e q u a l value. S h e d e n i e d that C h r i s t i a n i t y c o n d e m n e d w o m e n to
an inferior role in religious or s e c u l a r life.
The problems faced by women
in Latin America were the subject
of an informative talk by a Chilean
student at a February meeting.
She described the poverty and
oppression of many women in the
South American countries and the
tremendous pressure to maintain
women's traditional role. For
example, if a woman went out to
work it was c o n s i d e r e d a
reflection of her husband's
inability to look after her. In some
countries it was very difficult for a
woman to study.
St. Valentine's Day prompted
discussion on the appropriate
theme of the concept of love.
Many of the grou p felt that women
did not always get a fair deal and a
lively discussion followed Mary's
introduction to the subject.
The variety of speakers and
subjects allow plenty of scope for
different opinions and the group
in no way excludes those who do
' not hold "militant feminist" views.
Next week Judith Walker, ICU's
first woman President, will speak
to WiST and everyone is welcome
to join us. The meeting will be on
Wednesday 28th February at
12.30 pm in the ICWA lounge.
