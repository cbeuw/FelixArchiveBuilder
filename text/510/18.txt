I.C. 2nds 13 - Neptune 3
I.C. 2nd team opened their Middlesex
League account with a game against
N E P T U N E , a new team in the league.
In the first quarter, I.C. took some
time to settle against a team with m o r e
enthusiasm than skill. However the ball
worked up to Dave Chadwick twice,
who was " s i t t i n g " in front of goal. With
a weak defender on his back, he had no
trouble shooting I.C. into a 2-0 lead. This
was pulled back after two mixups in the
L C . defence.
After the first break, I.C. were into their
stride. Nick Buckland and Steve M a d d e n
were playing well at the back, and Pat Porter
and Bob Bradley were finding C h a d w i c k well
with their passes. So well in fact, that he
added another five in this quarter.
After half time, with the score 7-2 to I.C.,
the pressure was kept on. Nick Buckland
found time to swim up and shoot home, Pat
Porter was left unmarked in front of goal and
added another. W i t h C o l i n Dale and D i m i t r i
Papaconstantinou swimming into space on
the wings, it was easy to pass forward to Dave
Chadwick, who scored 3 in this quarter, to
make his personal tally ten!
T h e last quarter saw a game Neptune
getting into the game more. t.C.'s only goal
came from C o l i n Dale, who was given a
second chance after swimming through with
the ball. Neptune also got one back-one of the
few times they managed to trouble
goalkeeper M a r k Cherry. The final score, 13-
3 to IC. A win well earned through a lot of
hard work.
Team: M. Cherry, N. Buckland, S. Madden, P.
Porter, B. Bradley, J. Williams, D. Chadwick, C.
Dale, D. Papaconstantinou.
I.C. 2nds 6 - Amphibians 7
Last Friday, I.C. played the replay of
their 2nd round L o n d o n K n o c k o u t M a t c h
against A m p h i b i a n s . Due to handicapping,
I.C. started the game 4-1 down. A depleted
team started off well, when Pete M c C a r t n e y
twice scored when I.C. were a man up. Before
the end of the first quarter, M i k e M c C a r t n e y
pulled back the third goal, and it seemed, as
in the first game, as if I.C. would go through.
In the second quarter play was very close
with numerous chances being created,
although no goals were scored. Paul H i n d l e
and Dave Dunstone were performing well i n .
defence, giving reserve goalkeeper Steve
Tayler a good deal of protection.
The third quarter started the scoring
again, Amphibians scoring twice before M i k e
M c C a r t n e y scored after a quickly taken free
throw. Towards the end of the quarter
A m p h i b i a m s went further ahead, but A n d y
Smith scored from a narrow angle to make
the score 7-6 to Amphibians.
In the last quarter it seemed as if I.C. must
score. Amphibians were a man down three
times. Pete M c C a r t n e y hit the bar, and from
the rebound, sent his second shot against the
bar. Numerous shots went just over the goal
or wide, but in the end a well disciplined
Amphibians team had hung on in an exciting
match.
Team: S. Tayler, P. Hindle, D. Dunstone, P.
McCartney, A. Smith, M. McCartney, T.
Rockingham, D. Chadwick.
I C R O S S C O U N T R Y
Before sinking into the usual tirade
of in-jokes and discussion of m e m b e r s '
unusual habits it is worth a reminder
that the I C C C are staging the Annual
Hyde Park Relay tomorrow, February
24th. This is regarded as the premier
Road Relay for Students in Britian, and
possibly Europe. There are over 120 6
m a n teams, including 20 f r o m abroad,
entered. Each lap is 3 miles long and
passes along the edge of the Serpentine.
This year's race promises to be very close
w i t h s t r o n g t e a m s e n t e r e d f r o m
Loughborough, West L o n d o n Institute of
H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n , C o l o g n e a n d
Birmingham. The defending champions,
Loughborough are bringing European 800m
bronze medallist, Sebastian Coe, and several
other internationls including J o h n Davies,
the current British Students C h a m p i o n , will
be racing. As for local heroes, London
University should be in the first ten, and on
their home ground IC will be fielding such
stars as " G r a n n y " Clarke (for the 9th-
consecutive year), " M i t t e n s " Morton,
"Beverly" K i r k , " S h u n t e r " Acford and
" K o o l k a t " Kelly, and we hope to finish in the
first 30. There will also be guest appearances
by a number of notorious old boys in an all
stars team. C o m i n g to the point, we need a lot
of help, so if you're free tomorrow afternoon,
and want a free tea, report to the Reception
by the M a i n U n i o n Staircase at 2:00 p m - we
really will be grateful.
Changing the subject, we are now well into
the R o a d Relay. Season and on Wednesday
14th we went to Cambridge for the Selwyn
College Relay.
The 2.2 mile course was partially obscured by
snow and we had to fight gale-force winds
and snow showers throughout the afternoon.
This seemed to have little effect on Ian
M o r t o n who had sobered up after parties in
Scotland, and shot round in 10-56 to hand
over in 3rd position. Unaccustomed to being
so near the front, Bryan Acford lost 3 places,
but still went "Eyeballs O u t " to record 11-
19. Next off was " M a r a t h o n M a r k " Pickard
who ran strongly to pull us back to fourth
with a time of 11-20.
O n Saturday a small, but elite, band
deserted the dubious delights of College
Minibuses for the more random horrors of
British Rail's " F l y i n g Bananas". After a 1
hour late arrival at Bristol, our chauffeur
(Mick's Brother) took us to the course, which
was frozen solid and partially covered in
snow, and would obviously be very
treacherous. The race started half-an-hour
late, to give the tardy Reading Team time to
change. Over the tough 6 mile course, it was
the " o l d f i r m " of M o r t o n and Acford who
saved the day, performing superbly to finish
19th and 25th respectively. M i c k K e l l y had
an oiTday and was forced to drop out, but the
team was completed by a below par Banana
(non-flying variety) Harrington in 61st and
Ian Alvey in 64th. This was the 3rd race in
the Reebok Southern Universities League,
and we now lie 8th, 100 pts behind Oxford
Poly, who look set to win the College's
Trophy.
Meanwhile, the 'B' team were priviledged
to welcome back the C l u b Captain, Ian
Alvey, after a long absence. Ian came round
in 12-09 to hand over to T i m H a y ward in
22nd place, who gained one position,
although his time of 13-11 was somewhat
disappointing.

I think I'll start this week with the first team
yet again. As on Tuesday they furthered their
hopes for promotion considerably: - they
inflicted a 7-2 (home) defeat on N.A.L.G.O.
who had, in the previous three weeks, beaten
all the top three teams in their division (4).
This win was achieved by regulars Kumar and
Lakhani, and second team star - Andy Tye,
leaving the top league placings wide open.
Meanwhile the 2nd team played:
EXILES V (Home), winning 6 - 3
Helped by the team spirit of the opposition
(none of whom had met before), the seconds
won yet again, staying on top of division 5.
Andy won 3 again, Farzin won 2, and poor
little Roland (minus his bat - left by Jeff Stean
at Gainsford), won only 1 - Aaaah!
I.C. Ill v G A I N S F O R D Vl(away)
Despite the 1-8 score, was not a terribly
demoralising defeat, as they are clear at the
top of the league (excuses, excuses!) and
Stean did improve on his previous
performance against the same team, by
winning a set! (Ian Reed and I also "played").
I.C. IV v B A R B I C A N C . C . II (home)
This should have taken place on Friday,
only Barbican arrived on Wednesday (their
mistake) and then postponed the fixture.
And finally, I would like serious (that's a
laugh!) suggestions (preferably written on
pound notes - or fivers, etc.) as to an alter-
ego, persona, nom-de-plume or alias for next
term. (Yes, Wonder Woman was suggested,
several times, and the idea is under
consideration!?!).

T E N P I N BOWLING
Last Saturday saw London's first win in the
League for at least three years, beating
Portsmouth. Even so, the 9-1 score-line was a
slight disappointment, considering the
almost total domination of the home side.
After a walkover by the ladies team and a
comprehensive 4-0 win for the firsts, and with
both the second and third teams leading 2-0,
Portsmouth staged a comeback. The thirds
managed to hold on, for a 4-0 win, but
disappointing bowling from the seconds led
to a 2-2 draw, thus dropping a point.
On the whole, London bowled to average
individually, apart from a superb series from
Edmond Ng. His first game of 258, without
doubt a club record, heralded a fine 625
series.
This excellent result meant the team
travelled down to Portsmouth for the return,
with hopes of another good result. It was not
to be. While the firsts and seconds both won
easily, the home team seeming to take little
interest in the match, a depleted third team
and the (full-strength) ladies team were
unable to produce any shocks. A measure of
the seconds win is that they did better than
Portsmouth's firsts, due mainly to a
consistent series from Brian MacGowan with
190,187, 187 games. The final result was a 5-5
draw against the weakest team in thedivision.
These matches complete the club's league
fixtures for the year. Despite a great
improvement in performances, compared to
the last few years, due mainly to consistent,
high-scoring results from the firsts, only third
position was reached in the league. However
the top teams, Southampton and Brunei, rely
more on strength in depth, so the best
individual London bowlers have good
chances in tournaments in the next few
weeks.
