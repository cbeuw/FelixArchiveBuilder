machine, poisoned slowly to
death whilst the outer layer of my
skin is burned off over a period of.
more than an hour, or dragged
out into the open, to have my
head pulled off immediately to
stop me crying, and tossed into a
bucket along with a number of
other dead heads and bodies, I
think I would have quite strong
feelings on the matter. T h e only
difference is that I wouldn't be
able to shout out, hit back, 'phone
the police or write to my M . P .
And that is what we - an allegedly
civilised society - are taking-
advantage of.
The same article goes on to say
"it should he the right of the woman to
terminate her pregnancy, as it is the
woman whose life is directly affected. "
What piffle! Y o u mean it is the
convenience of the woman that is
affected; the only person whose
Hie is affected is the child's - his
right to life is being withdrawn.
W h y should a parent be given the
right to kill a child because of
convenience?? It's not the child':
fault - the mother and father
chose to take the risk. O f course,-
you do not like the term child, you
prefer "foetus" because that
makes people think the thing i n
the womb is something vastly
different. But are you aware that
by the time most abortions take
place the foetus is almost identical
to a new born child except i n
minor details e.g. eyelashes (as
mentioned above) and size?
The last bit ofblind abortionist
propaganda was thrown at us last
week by our ' "enlightened"
president, who implies that it is
disgusting for anyone to interfere
with a woman's right to kill her
own unborn children. She savs
that a woman should not be made
to support a child during
pregnancy against her will. Is Ms.
Attenborough aware that we can
easily use the same argument to
say that affluent people should
not be forced to support the poor
or even be made to pay to keep the
old, the sick and the handicapped
from starvation. More so in this
case, as it is not the fault of the
taxpayer that others are in need.
But in a civilised country we all
accept the need to make sacrifices
for the benefit of others who arc in
need. In the same way. it is
incompatible with any civilised
society to allow a woman to kill
h e r c h i l d r e n b e c a u s e o f
convenience.
I would like the readers finally
to consider the following extract
from D o c t o r J O W i l l k e ' s
" H a n d b o o k on Abortion". " F o r
two millenium in our western
culture, specifically protected by
our laws, a n d deeply imprinted
into the hearts of a l l men has
existed the absolute value of
honoring and protecting the right
of each person to live. This has
been a n i n a l i e n a b l e , a n d
unequivocal right. T h e only
exceptions have been that of
balancing a life for a life in certain
situations or by due process of
law.
O u r new permissive abortion
laws represent a complete about-
face, a total rejection ol one of the
core values of western man, and
an acceptance of a new ethic in
which life has only a relative
value. N o longer will every
human have an absolute right to
live simple because he exists. M a n
will now be allowed to exist only if
he measures up to certain
standards o f independence,
physical perfection, or utilitarian
usefulness to others. This is a
momentous change that strikes at
the root of western civilization.
It makes no difference to
vaguely assume that human life is
more human post-born than pre-
born. What is critical is to judge it
to be, or not to be, human life. By
a measure of " m o r e " or "less"
human, one r a n easily a n d
logically justify infanticide and
euthanasia. By the measure of
e c o n o m i c a n d / o r s o c i a l
usefulness, the ghastly atrocities of

i Hitlerian mass murders came to
be. O n e cannot help but be
reminded of the anguished
comment of a condemned Nazi
judge who said to a n American
judge after the Nuremburg trials:
"I never knew it would come to
this." T h e American judge
answered simply: "It came to this
the first time you condemned an
innocent life."
The inescapable fact is that,
regardless of the appealing
slogans of " a woman's right to
choose" or the misleading talk of
"foetus" or "termination of
p r e g n a n c y " o r w h a t e v e r ,
a b o r t i o n i s m is a l l bout
k i l l i n g , t h e unjust ifyable
slaughter of innocent, defenceless
children in the interests of people
who by their o w n voluntary
actions have created the child in
the first place.

THIRD WORLD FIRST
Third World First works mainly with students, explaining and
campaigning against the causes that lie behind world hunger,
economic exploitation, and violations of human rights.
Their aims are "to publicise the facts of international poverty: to
support the growing efforts of the poor to organise together to combat
poverty and decide their own path of development; and to expose and
oppose the interests of the rich and powerful who stand in their way". It
all sounds very red-blooded stuff, buy they do really undertake a lot of
very worthwhile work. The following are two examples of the work of
Third World First (3W1).
Argentina
"We shall kill as many as necessary to restore order"-so said General
Videla in November 1975. Since March 24th 1976, when the military took
power, he has carried out his threat. Thousands of people have been
killed and imprisoned, and 15,000 have simply 'disappeared'.
Such repression, which the
Junta must carry out if it is to
' succeed in its economic policies,
has meant a drastic fall in living
standards for the vast majority of
Argentines, and the destruction of
all organised opposition - whether
trades unions , student organi-
sations, or political parties. 3W1 is
campaigning to add Britain's
voice to the growing international
c o n d e m n a t i o n of t h e gross
v i o l a t i o n s o f h u m a n a n d
democratic rights in Argentina,
and calling for: the implemen-
tation of a visa programme for
political prisoners by the British
government, an end to aid from
international agencies, and a halt
to the arms trade between Britain
and Argentina.
Higher Education and Develop-
ment
Many students are concerned
about the problems of underde-
velopment in the Third World:
unemployment, extreme poverty,
exploitation of labour, etc. But the
desire to 'do something about it'
often ignores the fact that their
own college, which so liberally
allows the time and resources to
carry out such action, is itself
helping to perpetutate inequal-
ities in the Third World and in
Britain. 3W1 has already begun
some research and action on
t h e s e i s s u e s , a n d s o m e
p r e l i m i n a r y t a l k i n g p o i n t s
include: - Who funds military and
other research in colleges, and
why? Why is so little money spent
on research into alternative
technology? Why the lack of
activity in the student movement
on international issues? Why does
t h e N U S o n l y have policy on Chile
and South Africa?
If you would like to know more
about Third World First, then

YOUR HELP IS STILL NEEDED
A s l s a i d i n F E L I X a few weeks ago. if our Tuition Fee Campaign fails it
will be more due to student apathy than the strength or otherwise of our
case. T h e chances are that most people reading this will not be
affected by the fee increases, because your fees are paid by someone
I else. But spare a thought, if you will, to those of your colleagues, w h o
I may well suffer financial hardship as a result. We still urgently need
people to take part in the lobby-a-day and the speak-in. The latter is at
Speakers' Corner this Sunday (25th Feb.), so please come along and
take part - (we've prepared a set speech to read) - especially if you can
speak a foreign language. Ideally, pop into the Union Office and see J e n
today, but if not, just come along on Sunday - any time.
