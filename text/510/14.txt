Too M a n y Chefs (A)
Too M a n y Chefs is a half-baked comedy-
thriller that was poorly directed. The film
started as if silent movie custard pie slapstick
would be served up throughout. Lovers of
whipped cream fights will enjoy watching
gallons of sticky gook showering around the
set. Gradually the director seemed to get
bored with slapstick and tried to make a
comedy - thriller by using old jokes and a
" w h o d u n n i t ? " format.
T h e gourmet, M a x i m i l l i a n Vandervere
(Robert Morley) featured the "perfect m e a l "
in his magazine. Chefs throughout Europe
prepared their most famous creations for
each stage of the meal and the M a x i m i l l i a n
was glad to eat anything they served up.
Gradually the top chefs featured in the
magazine are murdered in the style of their
creations. A l l very absorbing but after the
third murder the plot became predictable.
Natasha (Jacqueline Bisset) realises that
there is a pattern to the killings and she is the
next on the list. The viewer is encouraged to
suspect one- gourmet after the first murder
only to be contradicted as the story continues.
The true murderer ... in typical " w h o
d u n n i t " tradition is the person one always
overlooks. By the time the identity is revealed
the urge to hurry home for a good meal after
sitting through two hours of watching food
becomes more relevant than puzzling out
who was the murderer.
The film was directed in the style of the

together but the production team deserve to
be thrown in the whipped cream for their
poor performance.

Showing at the Gate (Notting Hill),
"Interiors" is Woody Allen's new "serious"
film. It is written and directed by him though,
unlike his earlier films, he doesn't appear in it
himself.
The film is about a middle-class American
family dominated by Eve, a depressive
intellectual, and her 3 daughters (one of
whom is played by Diane Keaton) whom she
deeply influenced. Eve's husband leaves her,
supposedly for a trial separation, returning
with Pearl, a divorcee, who is the direct
opposite of Eve. The film shows Eve's (and
her daughters') reactions to Pearl, who
eventually becomes their stepmother.
The structure of the film is similar to other
Allen films: a series of separate scenes not
necessarily in chronological order, but
nevertheless easy to fol low. All the scenes are
beautifully arranged and filmed especially
the one where Eve arrives at her ex-husband's
wedding to Pearl. A n almost overwhelmingly
powerful scene, it is a very moving climax to
the film, producing an awe-inspired silence
from the audience. The relations between
various members of the family, portrayed
with telling detail, all rang true but were
perhaps too open: no feelings at all were
hidden. As a result there was hardly any light
conversation at all until Pearl arrived to give
Eve's daughters, in effect, a "culture shock".
This, the scene where Pearl was introduced
to two of the daughters, was brilliantly funny.
It made the "tone" of the film much lighter,
and it was only then that you realised how
good the preceding part had been.
Having felt vaguely dissatisfied with Allen's
earlier films, apart from the excellent "Annie
Hall", I think this is easily his best film to date.
Despite its serious nature this is probably
more accessable than his comedy films: the
h u m o u r is m u c h s h a r p e r and more
controlled. In this film Allen shows his true
class as a director, which has not been as
apparent in his earlier films. Though not as
superficially exciting as some of 'the
blockbuster films on at the moment, it is
probably one of the best films showing in
London. G o and see it, it won't hurt, honest.
