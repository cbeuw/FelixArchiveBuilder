The establishment o f a sabbatical Deputy President o f
Imperial College U n i o n took a step f o r w a r d last Friday when
the College Governors voted to allow the U n i o n a fourth
sabbatical position.
As expected they did not grant the U n i o n any additional money to
pay for the post. T h e U n i o n is still investigating means of raising the
money from existing income but is confident that enough cash in
available.
T h e College's reluctance to pay for four sabbaticals seems to stem
from a lack of understanding of the need for a sabbatical F E L I X Editor.
They consider that F E L I X could be produced on a part-time basis. ,
But there will be no change i n the status of the F E L I X Editor as his
job is laid down in the U n i o n bye laws.
U n i o n President M a r y Attenborough is drafting a job description for
the new sabbatical Deputy President to present to I C U n i o n C o u n c i l
and a U n i o n General Meeting. His j o b will include that of J u n i o r
Treasurer.
T h e setting up of the fourth sabbatical post still has to overcome one
final hurdle, namely a vote to change U n i o n bye laws at the U n i o n
Meeting on 8th M a r c h .
U n i o n Secretary a n d election Returning Office M i k e E l k i n has,
however, anticipated the Union's decision a n d has indicated on the
Deputy President nomination paper that the position is to become
sabbatical from 1st J u l y .
Elections for the four posts of President, Honorary Secretary, F E L I X
Editor and Deputy President are to take place on 12th and 13th M a r c h
in a College-wide ballot. T h e hustings meeting will be on 8th M a r c h
and nomination papers were posted last M o n d a y in the U n i o n Lower
Lounge.

A b o u t 50 residents of H a m l e t

called by Imperial College U n i o n

off by the work of I C U a n d

Rector's proposals.
IC U n i o n presented a paper, written by External Affairs Officer
Sheyne Lucock, to the meeting which also outlined the Union's
arguments against the inclusion of non-food costs in the regulator. T h e
Paper said that costs such as wage increases could be accounted for in
the termly price reviews.
Refectory Committee is to discuss the working of the regulator in line
with the Governors' recommendation at its meeting on 1st M a r c h .

Planning C o m m i t t e e decided to m a k e major changes to the

the replacement o f the current specialist m u s i c p r o g r a m m e s
between 9.00 a n d 11.00 p . m . with a daily, broad-based
p r o g r a m m e of music which, it is expected, will carry a high
proportion o f requests. Specialist p r o g r a m m e s w i l l r u n f r o m
6.00 to 7.00 p.m., m a k i n g a typical daily schedule of:
5.00 p.m.

T h e reasons for these changes are the disappointing response to the
specialist programmes a n d the demand for more general music
programming for the late evening in the bars.
These changes will not affect the proportion of non-music content i n
the programmes; this will continue to increase gradually.
It is hoped that most of the specialist programmes will return in the
near future, if a demand can be demonstrated. A full detailed schedule
will be published on Saturday as usual. John Allen
Station M a n a g e r
H e has pointed out that this
policy is linked to the U n i o n of
L i b e r a l Students' call for a
student wage to replace the grant.
Receiving a wage would make
students part of the wider
community a n d put an end to
their status as a "privileged elite",
in their view. T h e wage would be
fixed by " t h e c o m m u n i t y " , in
accordance with L i b e r a l policy
for t h e r e f o r m o f l o c a l
government.
In this context Sheyne Lucock
felt that voluntary student union
membership would be desirable.
But if put into practice now the
unions would no longer be able to
provide any student facilities as
not enough people would join.
Sheyne Lucock is expected to
stand for the post of C h a i r m a n of
the U n i o n of L i b e r a l Students. If
elected L i b e r a l students are
unlikely to have a dull year.

be taking a local education
authority to court over the denial
of grants to students affected by
the change in ordinary residence
qualification.
T h e Union's legal advisers
think that the U n i o n stands a
good chance of winnin g but is
unlikely to be granted legal aid.
T h e action would be a test case for
which legal a i d is not normally
granted.
T h e U n i o n is to approach the
College and the U n i t e d K i n g d o m
C o u n c i l for Overseas Student
Affairs ( U K C O S A ) for financial
assistance.
There are six I C students
affected by the new ruling and the
education authorities involved
are Inner L o n d o n , Dorset, Herts,
Barnet a n d Shropshire. T h e
U n i o n would be proceeding
against one of them through the
student concerned.
