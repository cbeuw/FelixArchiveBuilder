DOUGHNUT DISECTION
Its not often I get the chance to eat a doughnut. In fact I don't
recall devouring a single one since I arrived at college.
Yes, I was shocked at the price, but it was worth it. Anyhow
this article is not about value for money.
Upon sitting down with the beauty begging on a plate in front
of me, I was reminded of the disection problem.
" W h a t ' s the m a x i m u m number of pieces you can get with three
simultaneous cuts through one doughnut?"
I had vague memories of the solution but was not certain. I closed my
eyes and tried to picture it but the problem gave me a headache so I
gave up for a short while.
Then I hit on the idea of actually trying out the cuts on a real
doughnut, so I purchased a couple to bring back with me for this
purpose.
Obtaining the full set of pieces was not easy. After finding that
reasonably predictable cuts could be made with embedded toothpicks
as guides, I made my first full-scale section, only to discover that no
trace of two of the smaller pieces could be found. (There were plenty of
crumbs, but I suppose they don't count.)
It turned out that the requirement that three planes be cut through a
doughnut necessitates not only care in cutting but very thorough
provision against movement under pressure as successive cuts are made.
O n my final doughnut, using steel skewers instead of toothpicks, I
achieved complete success and obtained more pieces than I should but
this was due to the fact that the hole was not very round.
A very thin hulu-hoop-shaped doughnut might make cutting easier
but I have not seen any on sale, so this theory might be difficult to
explore.
