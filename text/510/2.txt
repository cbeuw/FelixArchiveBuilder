Dear Sir, - I would like to clear
some points which M r . Walker
has made in his letter in the last
issue of F E L I X (no. 509)
regarding the Islamic system. T h e
m a i n confusion seems to arise
from a mis-understanding of the
differences between ideology and
the way a system has to be put into
practice. So far, in most countries
that claim to have adapted the
Islamic system, a very important
factor, that of education, has been
missing.
In these countries the people
are not educated according to the
principles of Islam but rather
according to imported education-
al systems which have been forced
upon them, (which do not match
t h e i r s o c i a l - c u l t u r a l n e e d s
anyway). Yet the same people are
punished according to Islamic
rules, which is only a tiny part of
the complete Islamic system.
T h e free i n d u l g e n c e i n
d r i n k i n g , g a m b l i n g , sexual
promiscuity and similar activites
do not seem to be the signs of a
healthy society, and so any society
should have punishments for
them.
D u e to domination, (economic
and political) of these countries by
the West, the ideology of Islam,
has not had an opportunity to be
given expression in its complete
form.
W i t h the revolution in Iran and
other such movements in the
countries of the third world we
hope the local cultural traditions
in these countries, will have the
opportunity to free themselves of
t h e s h a c k l e s o f f o r e i g n
suppression. (Whether it be
Western or Eastern). Instead we
believe the world would benefit
from an atmosphere of mutual
respect and regard for the diverse
cultural traditions in different
countries.

Sir, - After reading the comments
pn the refectory boycott made in
last week's issue of F E L I X , I
would like to make my point of
view known. I a m one of the
people who ate in Southside on
that day, at lunchtime, i n
defiance of the boycott. I did so
only after a lot of thought, and
after reading most of the publicity
put out on the subject.
I eat in Southside every
weekday lunchtime, and find the
q u a l i t y a n d p r i c e q u i t e
reasonable. A t this point I would
- like to add that I a m i n favour of
action taken against the mis-use of
the regulator, which appears
likely i n the near future, rather
than action just taken about
present q u a l i t y a n d prices
generally.
O n e of the arguments put
forward for supporting the
boycott, about which I though
longest and hardest, was that I
should support the boycott to
show solidarity with the views of
the vast majority of Imperial
C o l l e g e s t u d e n t s w h o are
dissatisifed with the service.
However, I finally decided that,
as I personally had no complaint
about the refectory service, to
support the boycott would be to
forego my views in favour of those
of the majority. I decided that this
would be wrong and I think most:
people would be reasonable
enought to accept this.
I hope that I have put forward
my views sufficiently well for
M a l c o l m Brain to realise that the
people who ate in Southside were
not necessarily "the moron element
who go out of their way to oppose the
â€¢views of the vast majority.", but
people with opinions of their own.
T h e d e s c r i p t i o n " S C A B "
applied as a generalisation by J a n
is derogatory and typifies the
attitudes of extremists who attach
to these " w o r t h y " causes, i.e. that
anyone who holds the opposite
view to theirs should be attacked
as violently as possible, physically
or verbally.
- Finally, I would just like to add
that the behaviour of the pickets
outside Southside at lunchtime
was excellent, and no effort to
intimidate was made, the pickets
merely stating their case.
T h a n k you for your time,

Dear Sir, - H a v i n g ordered a 20 p
hotdog (not a student-type price)
in the U n i o n Lower Lounge last
Thursday evening, I found one
side to be undercooked and
inedible upon taking the first bite
(ugh!). I asked the barman to
replace it with one which was
properly cooked. The answer was
a plain N O . W o u l d he give me my
money back? H e refused to do
either of these things because;
"you've already taken a bite out
of it." W e l l I never. It's like taking
a pair of faulty shoes back to a
shop and an assistant saying " B u t
you've worn them." It seems that
the college bars are very keen to
take your money and offer you no
service in return, no pleases or
thankyous. The barman, Roger
Pownall conceded only one thing;
to give me his name, so that I
"could go through the proper
c h a n n e l s a n d m a k e m y
complaint." M y main interest
however was to eat an edible
hotdog.
In the U.S.A. that barman
would have been reprimanded or
sacked for the attitude 'the
customer is always wrong'.
Yours with hunger,
J . Chamberlain.

Dear Sir, - In view of the recent
debate on homosexuality and the
proposed motion likely to be
discussed at the next U n i o n
General meeting, I would like to
state, or clarify, the Christian
position on this issue.
M a n y people feel that one has
no right to interfere with another
person's private life, or to tell
them what is right and wrong;
and as a child I too felt this way
about homosexuality. I knew by
my conscience that homosexual-
ity was wrong and abnormal, but
I couldn't see a reason for
prohibiting it by L a w - until I
read the Bible. (For all Christians
the Bible is our first and last line of
defence in any matter of dispute:
we believe it to be the absolute
standard). G o d has said in the
Bible, " Y o u shall not lie with a
male as with a woman ... If a man
lies with a male as with a woman,
both of them have committed an
a b o m i n a t i o n . " ( L e v i t i c u s ,
chapter 18 v22 and 20 v l 3
It is because of what the Bible
says, that I believe homosexuality
is a sin, which should be
prohibited as much as, say, incest.
Finally, I would like to say why
I believe G o d abhors this act. G o d
created us and knows our form
and make-up. H e designed our
b o d i e s f o r h e t e r o s e x u a l
r e a l t i o n s h i p s , i n s t i t u t i n g
marriage between a man and a
woman. Sexual relationships
between two people of the same
sex was not intended, and such
acts will cause harm to the persons
concerned.
Yours faithfully,
Jamie Shotter

Dear Sir, - Y o u may be pleased to
hear how interesting F E L I X is
considered to be. H a v i n g spent a
Friday in the college health centre
8 out of ten people visiting me
greeted me with "I thought you
might be bored. I've brought you
a F E L I X ! " Congratulations!

Sir, - M r . White's letter ( F E L I X
508) exhibits the typical form of
wishful thinking which many
abortionists adopt. The great
lengths to which M r . White goes
to try to prove that an unborn
child is vastly different to a born
child, apart from the fact that
they are based on prejudice and
not on fact, still do not give any
satisfactory reason why we can
sentence such a child to death.
M r . White, you haven't proved
that the unborn child is inferior.
Y o u haven't shown why you can
do things to h i m that you can't do
to a newly-born infant. I simply
ask y o u to p r o v e beyond,
reasonable doubt that the child in
the w o m b is second-class. Y o u
want to do the killing, so the onus
of proof is on you.
Y o u say he is m e r e l y
'dependent'. But so is an infant.
A n d anyway, why should that
mean that you can kill him?
Y o u say he is merely part of his
mother. T h i s is b i o l o g i c a l
nonsence. H e is a distinct person.
Y o u don't say that his mother has
'lost' something when he's born,
do you? o
Y o u say he's unwanted. But
why does that give you the right to
kil! him? If it is permissible to kill
the unwanted, most forms of
m u r d e r , m a s s - k i l l i n g s a n d
genocide cease to be wrong.
Y o u say he's not yet as
developed, not yet as conscious or
social as a born person, and hence
less valuable. If that's so, a
handsome, intelligent, middle-
class adult is more valuable than
an illiterate peasant or a crippled
Ghetto negro (because he's more
developed), and a teenager more
valuable than a child. That's
horrifying talk. A civilised society
carefully protects the weak and
v u l n e r a b l e , t h a t i s , t h e
undeveloped, and gives equality
before the law to all.
The factory-master used to say
that his workers were merely
'dependent' on him and at his
disposal. Remember how often
European powers have argued
that their colonies were 'part of
the motherland and that nobody
should interfere with them? It was
often claimed of the millions of
Africans shipped across the
Atlantic to slavery in America
that they weren't really humans
or that they would be better off as
slaves. Apartheid rests on the
'principle' that Blacks are less
developed than Whites and
therefore inferior.
What the abortionist now says
we've heard a hundred times
before. This is the way, all down
history, that men have tried to
justify oppression, discrimination
and rejection. The unborn child is
simply the latest victim of age-old
double-talk.
M r . W h i t e , i n t y p i c a l
abortionists style, tries to suggest
that birth is the biggest step in the
development of a child. There
isn't room to discuss this here but
if M r . White or anyone else has
the inclination to buy or borrow
any of our leaflets from our weekly
bookstall when P A T A gets started
he will find that birth - which
occurs about four months after
even the baby's eyebrows and
eyelashes have begun to grow, is
simply an incident in an already
far-advanced process.
In similar style, the Liberal
C l u b ' s - l a t e s t e d i t i o n o f
F O R W A R D ! attempts to suggest
that abortion is just a religious
question. W e l l I would like to see
the Liberal Club, or anyone else
for that matter, try to pin me to a
religious belief. The article says
that "the foetus .... has no feelings on
the matter at all." Is the author of
t this article aware that, within
twenty five days of conception,
before the mother is even likely to
suspect that she is pregnant, the two
sides of the child's brain are
already coming together and the
child is already doing some
elementary thinking? If I were in
such a position, and knew I was
going to be torn to shreds by a
