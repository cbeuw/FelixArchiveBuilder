C I T Y & G U I L D S
On Thursday 15th February after some delay due to a major
cock-up at the booking office, the Guild's U G M was held in
Mech Eng 542. The main point of discussion was whether
political motions should be discussed at Guild's Union
meetings. The general concensus of the meeting was that
procedures should be left as they stand at the moment.
M o t i o n s will receive p u b l i c i t y for the d e b a t e to a l l o w o p p o s e r s
time to p r e p a r e their d e b a t e s . If the m o t i o n is s u b m i t t e d less
than three d a y s f r o m the date of the m e e t i n g the C h a i r m a n c a n
use his d i s c r e t i o n to d e c i d e if the m o t i o n s h o u l d be put to the
meeting. If the E x e c feel that the m o t i o n w o u l d be m o r e s u i t e d to
an I.C. U n i o n m e e t i n g , they will s u g g e s t this to the p r o p o s e r and
if h e / s h e agrees, the E x e c w o u l d offer all p o s s i b l e a s s i s t a n c e in
s u b m i t t i n g it to an I.C. U . G . M . H o w e v e r , every m e m b e r of
G u i l d s has the right to s u b m i t the m o t i o n to a G u i l d ' s U . G . M . if
they still s o desire. It was felt that the m o t i o n s h o u l d be h e a r d at
the m e e t i n g a n d t h e n the m e e t i n g s h o u l d vote o n w h e t h e r the
d i s c u s s i o n s h o u l d c o n t i n u e .
The rest of the meeting
consisted of an entertaining trial
of a beer barrel, with Simon Lea
eloquently prosecuting and Bob
Hart defending. The barrel was
found guilty of loitering for one-
and-a-half years in the Guilds'
Union Office and was sentenced
to be placed in the I.C. Union
Office.
The Guilds/I.F. party was a
great success and like all Guilds'
events was sold out with many
people turned away at the door.
Remember, if you want to be sure
of getting in to an event, make
sure you buy your ticket well in
advance.
The Bristol 24hr pedal car race
has been and gone, with Guilds
coming a very creditable 6th
against stiff opposition (Rolls
Royce came 1st and 2nd-yawn!l)
and with a lack of people due to
the Guilds/I.F. party held on the
same day.

THIS HOUSE DOES NOT
BELIEVE IN
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
Or so the motion went anyway.
The debate itself was very
amusing with strong arguments
being presented by both the
proposition and opposition. Mike
Pickup opened with an amusing,
indeferent and lively speech for
the proposition. Unfortunately
this was quickly dismissed by
Mick Berry who opened for the
opposition in a very amusing
speech: Chris Russell seconded
the motion with a talk on
comprehensive education and
how equal ppportunity did not
work in practice. This was
followed by the seconder against
the motion John Shuttleworth.
The mood of the debate was now
getting very tense after two very
serious speeches and so we found
a little relief when Daphne
Websper, who chaired the event,
called on Colin Palmer to speak
for the motion. A very amusing
s p e e c h followed w h i c h left
Sheyne Lucock, the final speaker
for the motion, with an easy road
to persue his opponent with a very
i m p r e s s i v e a n d i m p r o m p t u
speech. Questions from the floor
were confused and often asked to
the wrong team. After a summing-
up speech from both sides, the
result was "This House Does
Believe in Equal Opportunity".
Never mind, all who went were
very amused by it all.

J U D O
Judo was developed in Japan at
the end of the last century, from
the martial art ju-jitsu. The intent
was to obtain a sport which, whilst
retaining the agressiveness and
form of personal combat did not
have as its object the injury of the
opponent. In this, judo has
succeeded magnificiently. With
the aim of throwing the opponent
onto the specially padded mats
used (or in groundwork, winning
by means of either a hold down, or
submission from a stranglehold or
armlock), it is an intensely
competitive fighting sport, while
the incidence of injuries is no
greater than in sports such as
rugby or football.
This Sunday (25th February),
I.C. Judo Club is staging the first
of what is hoped to be an annual
event - the London Colleges
Invitation Tournament. Taking
place in the Great Hall (11.00
start), it will feature some of the
t o p s t u d e n t j u d o k a s (judo
"players") in London. I.C. has a
very good chance of winning, the
more so since one member of our
team, Owen Tutty, is the under 60
kg British Universities champion,
i However, we will be facing some
fierce competition, especially
from Q.M.C. and Kings College,
both of whom will fieldvery strong
teams. Whatever the outcome, it
ought to be an enjoyable day,
seeing some exciting fights.
Spectators are welcome, all the
more if they'll be'coming to cheer
on the I.C. teams.
