IF YOU'RE FED UP WITH
BEING STEREOTYPED, HOW
DO YOU THINK WE FEEL?
You've probably noticed that a lot of people have
somewhat unrealistic ideas about students, and the
way they see themselves.
While s o m e students have an equally unrealistic
conception of what working in industry is really like.
At Marconi Avionics, one man or w o m a n in every
four is a graduate, including people from this >

University, facts that should give you a better idea of
what working in the Avionics industry is like.
When deciding which electronics company should
get the benefit of your electronics, computer science,
mechanical, physics, maths or control engineering
degree, the choice is endless. But no matter how
attractive the work may sound, there's always the
thought at the back of your m i n d : "What happens if I
don't actually find it interesting once I'm t h e r e ? "
At M a r c o n i A v i o n i c s we've good cause to believe
that our projects are as interesting as any, and more
interesting than most.
But what really makes it worth your while talking to
us is a range and a diversity of activities that few
electronic c o m p a n i e s can offer y o u .
We've developed flight control systems for Concorde,
J u m b o Jets, and military aircraft. Giant airborne radar
systems and miniature t.v. c a m e r a s . A range of head-
up and head-down displays, neutron devices for
treating cancer, electro-optic devices, air data systems,
and micro-processor applications. In many
technologies, we're a h e a d of the state of the art, and
we have the imagination and the commitment to d e v e l o p
advanced techniques in highly practical applications.
If you join us, finding yourself stuck in one project or
one technology is the last thing you'll have to worry
about.
A far more pressing problem will be deciding which
of our 3 locations you'd prefer to work at, and which
of many projects you'd prefer to work on.
But we can talk about that when we meet.
In the meantime, see your careers service to find
out when we are visiting your university.
