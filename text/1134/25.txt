BRIEF CANDLE
New End Theatre
C
arlo Ardito's blue e y e s sparkle
w h e n h e explains h o w h e paid
£1000 for a g e n u i n e 1890 c o p y o f
Marie Bashkirtseff's journals, w h i c h - after
years o f obsession - inspired h i m to write
his m o v i n g yet very witty play, Brief Can-
dle. Marie Bashkirtseff was a 19th century
Russian-born, trench-bred painter w h o s e
premature death brought her t h e f a m e
she had always longed for. But o n e n e e d
not k n o w m u c h about this n o w (sadly
enough) forgotten artist to appreciate the
performance.
The play retraces her life from t h e
age o f 13 w h e n , comfortably secured in
a c o c o o n o f w o m e n figures a n d ser-
vants (her m o t h e r , aunt, c o u s i n a n d
Misha - all perfectly acted by a strong cast
full of complicity), s h e longs for absolute
love a n d k n o w l e d g e . B e t w e e n a f e w
lines of Plato a n d Shakespeare (her intel-
lectual e n d e a v o u r s are hilarious w h e n it
comes to French history!), s h e flirts with
Dukes a n d Priests, as well as their hier-
archical superiors, t h e king o f Spain a n d
the Pope himself. All t h e latter are played
by Denis Quilley, w h o d o e s a remarkable
job of switching from o n e character to
the other b y w a y o f costume changes. As
Marie grows into a stunningly beautiful
w o m a n "with the most elegant of skins",
she steers away from her quest for love
a n d her father's will for her to marry, per-
haps a little disillusioned by her parents
o w n marital failure.
She stands u p to her
father b y p l e a d i n g
for the equal right of
w o m e n t o b e pro-
fessional artists. By
c h o o s i n g t h e arts
(first m u s i c , t h e n
painting), Marie not
only embraces a w a y
of life, but also fol-
lows a self-imposed,
strenuous discipline
w h i c h conflicts with I
her frail constitution. I
"Whatever M a r i e is, jj
she is intensely". M
As t h e play unfolds, w e are m o v e d
by Marie's wonderful character, played by
the talented Celia White, w h o s u c c e e d s
in conveying t h e existential questioning,
a m b i t i o n , e n t h u s i a s m , s u f f e r i n g a n d
s o m e t i m e s even cruel determination o f
the y o u n g w o m a n . Progressively Marie
loses her beautiful voice (note the live
singing o f Tosti's Aprlle by Carol Wells
a c c o m p a n i e d o n t h e piano by M a u r e e n
Parry) a n d then her hearing. She starts
reflecting o n the pointlessness of h u m a n
endeavours, the w i c k e d n e s s o f a sup-
p o s e d l y m e r c i f u l
G o d , a n d t h e ironi-
cal paradox between
ambition a n d illness.
Just as s h e starts to
taste success, Marie
r e a c h e s h e r
ineluctable fate, a n d
dies o f tuberculosis.
H o w e v e r - a n d this
is the moral o f t h e
story - art triumphs
over d e a t h since
Bashkirtseff's writ-
ings a n d paintings
t o d a y survive. Life,
after all, s h o u l d b e
a candle cut in four
and burning at all ends".
The play addresses serious themes,
often with ironic u n d e r t o n e s or outward
humour, like the Russian elite in I ranee
during the 19th century, f e m i n i s m , the
place of art in life, t h e criteria o f perfec-
tion in painting (Bashkirtseff critically
describes Impressionism - as "patches"
lived like Marie's:
w h i c h lack precision a n d a r e a "great
mistake"), the role o f religion a n d t h e
hypocrisy of the clergy. Quillcy brings the
a u d i e n c e to laughter with his mastery of
the n u a n c e s o f sarcastic inflexions in his
voice, while White brings a refreshing
youthful smile to our faces. W e never get
b o r e d by w h a t w e hear or s e e . Director
Stella Quilley's d e e p c o n c e r n for minute
details c a n definitely be sensed, whether
with t h e accessories, t h e interesting use
of light a n d music, t h e divide o f t h e
stage (particularly relevant for the epis-
tolary s c e n e b e t w e e n M a r i e a n d t h e
author G u y d e Maupassant), or t h e orig-
inal presence o f a narrator g u i d i n g the
play. I inally, the theatre itself is small
a n d cosy, with n o visibility or acoustics
problems. What m o r e c a n w e say, but g o
and check the play out for yourselves! W e
thoroughly enjoyed it.

his is t h e latest s h o w at t h e very
famous Saatchi Gallery, w h i c h reg-
ularly stages t h e most controver-
sial, cutting-edge a n d exciting exhibitions
in f o n d o n . The display is t h e first instal-
ment in a series p r o m o t i n g t h e latest
works by s o m e of the most forward think-
ing artists in Britain, s o m e also featured
in the brilliant Die young Stay pretty s h o w
at the ICA, w h i c h e n d e d a f e w w e e k s
ago.
Steven Gontarski has brought m o r e
of his fascinating sculptures m a d e o f
polyester, PVC a n d synthetic hair. T h e
shapes are extremely o d d , s o m e with a
strong sexual feel to t h e m . They are all
t r e m e n d o u s l y c o m p e l l i n g a n d quite
beautiful. Martin Maloney's work, entitled
Sex Club, is rather different. It focuses o n
different sexual behaviours o f gay m e n .
The paintings a r e highly explicit, por-
traying several ways o f e n a c t i n g s a d o -
m a s o c h i s m . A lot o f t h e p e o p l e l o o k i n g
at these pieces w e r e quite disturbed.
Maloney's style is particular and this helps
m o c k t h e stereotypes o f t h e things h e
paints. His technique pays off well a n d h e
is very c o u r a g e o u s t o explore such a
t o u c h y subject, usually b u r i e d d e e p
u n d e r g r o u n d o n t h e art scene. O n t h e
ship. Richard Wilson's 20.50 is stunning;
he has simply created a pool of oil a n d
the effect is difficult t o describe. All I
can say is that it's magical a n d like noth-
ing else I have ever seen. Paul Smith has
c o m e u p with t w o sets o f photos. The
interesting thing about this work is that
drunk a n d b e i n g sick in the toilets. The
other depicts multiple; war scenes w h e r e
he attempts to s h o w the horrors o f vio-
lence. His work is definitely not o n e o f
my favourites. Finally, the main r o o m o f
the gallery is taken u p by a n e n o r m o u s
installation o f T o m o k o Takahashi, w h o
has created a fantastic m a z e o n the floor
from a clatter o f rubbish - TV sets, clocks,
electrical appliances, type writers, loads
of paper a n d stickers... S o m e of the litter
is still w o r k i n g so there is an awful noise
of ticking a n d b a n g i n g . It s e e m s like
lakahashi w a n t e d to represent a house,
using objects from the bathroom a n d the
b e d r o o m , others that b e l o n g in the gar-
d e n or t h e living r o o m . You can spend
lots of time just w a l k i n g a r o u n d reading
all t h e notes o n t h e walls. The overall
impression reveals our d e p e n d e n c e o n
t e c h n o l o g y in everyday life a n d h o w w e
waste so m u c h .
This s h o w is u n m i s s a b l e because it
is yet a n o t h e r indicator o f the strong
a n d exciting art s c e n e in Britain. These
arc the classics o f the future a n d it is fan-
tastic to witness t h e m a k i n g o f these
fascinating n e w artists.
