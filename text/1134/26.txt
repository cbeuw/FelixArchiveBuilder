Shimmering water, b l o o m i n g flowers

also offers a selection o f images from
M o n e t ' s travels t o L o n d o n a n d Venice.
His multiple scries, depicting identical
subjects at different hours o f t h e day
under various weather conditions (misty,
cloudy, rainy, sunny) are particularly cel-
ebrated. "It's t h e f o g that gives L o n d o n

his balcony of the Savoy Hotel, he repeat-
edly painted the H o u s e s o f Parliament
and n u m e r o u s bridges over t h e River
Thames.
Controversy rages over t h e signifi-
cance o f M o n e t ' s deteriorating eyesight
in his dramatic shift of style towards t h e
e n d o f his life. H i n d e r e d by a cataract
operation, his crude brushwork verges
o n t h e boldly abstract with a n unfin-
ished, informal e d g e . He also appears to
e x p e r i m e n t with colour, i n c l u d i n g a n
atypical russet palette. T h e result is
u n c o n v e n t i o n a l a n d refreshingly
unrecognisable.
The aesthetic climax of the exhibition
is t h e last gallery w h i c h contains samples
of his ambitious Grandes Decorations
project. This s e q u e n c e of horizontal p a n -
els is particularly impressive by its m o n -
umental scale, s o m e s p a n n i n g 18 feet in
width. M o n e t d o n a t e d 22 pictures to the
I rench nation in celebration o f the Allied
victory d u r i n g t h e first World War.
M o n e t invariably appeals to the pub-
lic because his w o r k is decorative, u n d e -
m a n d i n g , accessible a n d familiar. The
s e n s a t i o n a l d e m a n d for tickets (over
130,000 p r e - b o o k e d places) is p r o o f
e n o u g h o f his astonishing popularity in
Britain. A l t h o u g h r u m o u r s o f 24 hour

q u e u e s a n d c r o w d s . Despite t h e
inevitable topical repetitiveness, s h a m e -
fully inflated prices a n d outrageous mer-
chandising, this acclaimed event is t h e
highlight of t h e annual arts calendar.
