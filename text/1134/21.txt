Hardfloor
"All Targets Down" (Harthouse)
With r e m i x e s o f N e w O r d e r a n d
Mori Kante to their n a m e (amongst oth-
ers), it is n o surprise that Hardfloor's
album "All Targets D o w n " is of superb
quality, retaining the distinctive s o u n d s
associated with Hardfloor. There are nine
tracks o n the hour-long C D , w h i c h also
Includes a b o n u s track. All the tracks are
hard h o u s e / t e c h n o with heavy bass
lines a n d Josh Wink type t w e a k i n g , per-
fectly c o m p l e m e n t i n g the m o r e subtle
background noises. It's a no-nonsense
a l b u m , d e m o n s t r a t i n g that H a r d f l o o r
cannot just remix, but can p r o d u c e qual-
ity tracks o f their o w n . As the advert
reads, it's a collection of devastating
tech-infected tracks - I'll g o a l o n g with
that!

Ministry of Sound
•Clubbers Guide to '99"
For m a n y p e o p l e these mix c o m p i -
lations are only as g o o d as the singles
the DJ has u s e d . N o w quite a lot o f p e o -
ple have heard this a l b u m - friends/flat
mates/the guys in the lads, a n d they've
all said the s a m e thing.... "The A l b u m s
got nice p a c k a g i n g , s h a m e a b o u t the
tracks". A view I agree with. There m a y
be two CDs with a total of 37 tracks but
I'm very surprised at Judge Jules' selec-
tion. Fair e n o u g h , as individual tracks
they're not bad, but w h e n they're m i x e d
together it's a bit of a mess. It is also a
bit disappointing to see that Jules is the
only featured DJ "mixing" o n the a l b u m
- makes the variety a bit thin. If you're
planning to s p e n d the £16 or so o n the
album, at least try a n d listen to it first.
With s o m e pretty unimpressive tracks it
would be wise to do so! Not bad, but not
the quality w e expect f r o m M O S .
John "00" Fleming
"Licensed to Thrill"
This is an excellent mix c o m p i l a t i o n
featuring J o h n "00" Fleming. It's not dig-
itally m i x e d , but r e c o r d e d live a n d
demonstrates Fleming's s u p e r b DJ qual-
ities at their very best. The tracks will send
uplifting trance a n d progressive h o u s e
fans wild with delight - there's a mixture
of a n t h e m s a n d s o m e not so f a m o u s
tunes. Each track is great a n d mixes well
with the tracks either s i d e o f it - as
o p p o s e d to the "just c h e c k e d together
to f o r m an a l b u m " s y n d r o m e . The mix
features tracks by Paul van Dyk a n d Jon
the Dentist - c o m e s h i g h l y r e c o m -
m e n d e d .

FFRR Classics 1988-1998
(fffr)
ffrr has b e e n with the d a n c e music
explosion in Britain since the very begin-
ning. A n offshoot of London Records, it's
Pete Tong's label a n d has b e e n associ-
ated with s o m e of the best tracks to
h a v e ever hit the dance-floors. The
a l b u m (as y o u can tell from the title) is
a compilation of all the very best ffrr
tunes to have b e e n p r o d u c e d - naturally
they're not all there but most of t h e m
are. There are three CDs a n d with about
17 tracks o n each o n e y o u are getting
quality as well as quantity. What's m o r e
is that the CDs are all u n m i x e d , allowing
y o u to enjoy the classics at their very
best. There's an e n o r m o u s a m o u n t of
variety o n the a l b u m , with tracks by CJ
Bolland, Salt n' Pepa, Orbital and Goldie,
to n a m e but a few. It's a great album that
will take y o u d o w n m e m o r y lane
( r e m e m b e r that person y o u s n o g g e d at
the H a c i e n d a a f e w years ago? N o - well
this a l b u m will jog your memory). Superb
- everything an a l b u m s h o u l d be.

Dope on Plastic 6
(React)
Another a l b u m , as the ever-popular
c o l l e c t i o n r e a c h e s its collection n o w
reaches its sixth v o l u m e a n d it's getting
better a n d better e a c h time. D O P 6 is a
d o u b l e C D a l b u m of the coolest, funki-
est s o u n d s a r o u n d . There are chilled-
out tracks, funk, soul, and a bit of big
beat, m a k i n g this an a l b u m of large vari-
ety a n d sheer class. If y o u liked any of
the first five in the series, you'll love
this.

Jiml Tenor
"Organism"
This has to be the coolest, funkiest
a l b u m a r o u n d . It's a very chilled-out
a l b u m that is s o m e w h a t like f r e n c h
h o u s e music. The kind of music you'd
hear o n cheesy 70s detective movies, it
is simply an essential buy. S o m e of the
s o u n d s are fantastic a n d there is plenty
of variety. A n extremely cool a l b u m - if
y o u w a n t an i d e a it's like Jamiroquai but
m u c h better, a n d without the a n n o y i n g
Jay Kay.

Singles
Single of the Week
Mankey
"Fire"
A quality house track with heavy
bass lines a n d a w o m a n r a n d o m l y
s c r e a m i n g "baby". A tune w h e r e the
synthesisers get the full treatment, to
give a hands-in-thc-air a n t h e m . C o m e s
with two mixes - a vocal mix (where she
screams "baby") and a d u b mix (where
she doesn't!).
Next Generation
"Forever"
A very unusual tune with plenty of
vocals (especially o n the vocal mix!).
Again, lots of synthesisers used, t h o u g h
the track is a mixture of D&B, euro-
house a n d normal bog-standard house
all rolled into o n e . A strange c o m b i n a -
tion but works surprisingly well. C o m e s
with a f e w mixes, but the best o n e is
the D u b mix w h e r e the lass doesn't
sing (??) as m u c h !

Overground Werx
"Gonna Lose My Love"
Euro-house style, lots o f synthesis-
ers, b r e a k d o w n s a n d heavy bass lines.
It starts off with a very a n n o y i n g beat
that g o e s o n for ages before the actual
tune kicks in. O n c e it gets g o i n g it is
g o o d . C o m i n g with a vocal a n d d u b
mixes, it r e m i n d s m e of Cappella a n d
Culture Beat ( r e m e m b e r them??).
