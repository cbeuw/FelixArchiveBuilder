The Slow Motion World of SnowponyP
Pet Shop Boy and Girls
O
n first listen, I t h o u g h t
S n o w p o n y w e r e just another
generic indie band, with their
spritely guitars a n d melancholic female
vocals. But after a f e w late nights listen-
ing to the a l b u m , sitting in semi-dark-
ness a n d feeling in a pensive m o o d ,
they started to g r o w o n m e . They use a
subtle b l e n d o f h a r m o n i e s that caress
your musical g-spot with a gently prob-
ing finger, arousing m e l o d i c nuances
a n d a b s o r b i n g rhythms in your t e m p o -
rals.
Two years in the m a k i n g . The Slow
Motion World... s h o w s quite a resem-
blance to The Breeders a n d M y Bloody
Valentine, with w h o m bassist D e b b i e
G o o g e o n c e played. T h e s o n g s still
s o u n d fresh t h o u g h , mainly thanks to
their u s e o f aptly placed samples w h i c h
lend a larger perspective to the tunes.
This is d u e to t h e influence o f ex-Stere-
olab keyboardist, Katharine Gifford, w h o
has certainly h a d a lot o f experience in
the o l d s a m p l i n g g a m e .
The a l b u m as a w h o l e has a g o o d
range of styles - n o two songs sound sim-
ilar- with a great mix o f different guitar
textures, f r o m t h e r a w stutter o f t h e
o p e n i n g track Easy Way Down to the
funky Rolling Stones-esque riff o n John
Brown, their most recent single. The
general t o n e o f the a l b u m is reflective
with tinges of jealousy, neuroticism a n d
insecurity. This can m a k e the lyrics very
e n d e a r i n g a n d often m a k e s a fairly dull
s o n g into an interesting o n e such as
the track Love Letters w h i c h focuses o n
a broken relationship.
Don't think that it's all d o o m a n d
g l o o m , t h o u g h . The shuffling g r o o v e o f
the percussion stops it all getting t o o
d o w n b e a t , a n d there's always a b i g ,
d e e p bass-line round the corner to keep
y o u interested.
I don't think there's e n o u g h here to
put The Slow-Motion World... into the
' o u t s t a n d i n g ' category but S n o w p o n y
have style a n d elegance, as well as elo-
q u e n c e . It's definitely worth m a k i n g a n
effort to have a listen a n d I k n o w I won't
get bored o f this a l b u m for a l o n g time.

t i o n e d already; it's the L m m e r d a l e o f
music; it's akin to an afternoon spent in
the c o m p a n y o f William H a g u e . O n e
s o n g , The Falls, m a n a g e s to e s c a p e the
mire, b e i n g almost sentient. The others
c o m e a n d g o like Italian G o v e r n m e n t s .
K e e p i n g a track o f w h i c h s o n g is playing
is nigh o n impossible - the only reminder
of their presence is the constant tedium.
If your goals are average a n d your
yearnings swathed in the ordinary then
this is the a l b u m for y o u . El

to b e frank it's a dull affair. It is certain-
ly not as offensively dull as, say, Robbie
Williams, M-People or The f i g h t h o u s e
family - it's just plain dull. The muso-
friendly a m o n g s t us will rejoice in its
A O R / M O R g l o w ; A m e r i c a n C o l l e g e
radio will revel in its ordinariness. Those
of us w h o consider Capital, Heart a n d

It's s o m e t h i n g that can't be quantified
a n d qualification is almost as hard. It
isn't taught or learnt, it's intuitive. The
p r o b l e m is that there don't s e e m to be
many o f us that possess this ability to dis-
criminate b e t w e e n w h a t ' s got it a n d

limp, pallid a n d downright offensively
poor. I'm not saying this a l b u m is o n e o f
the latter, it's just dull, as I may have men-
