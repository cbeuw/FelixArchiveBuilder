These are both p h o t o g r a p h s taken
by Andreas Gursky a n d your personal
response to his w o r k is exactly w h a t this
exhibition is a b o u t . Take h i s stock

it, like a n o l d school p h o t o g r a p h , scan-

of focus yet suffused by digital clarity. You

or Hong Kong, Stock Exchange portray
our world not as chaotic but highly reg-

Gursky's subjects, a n d o n e o f t h e s e ,
Rheln, depicts a section of the river as a n
abstract object, devoid o f p e o p l e a n d
obvious points o f interest. Engadln is a
startling p a n o r a m a of cross-country skiers
on a glacier, surely not high art, but tech-
nically superb a n d truly dramatic.
Gursky's pictures a r e carefully
p l a n n e d , c o n t r i v e d a n d extensively
edited using a c o m p u t e r ; they d o not
really exist, this is especially t h e case
with a f e w o f Gursky's photos, w h i c h
tackle t h e c o n c e p t o f 'sensation trans-
ference'. All this s o m e w h a t facile phrase
means is that our perception of an object
is influenced by its context; the triumph
of p a c k a g i n g over s u b s t a n c e . In t h e
photo Prada II, Gursky shows s o m e shelv-
ing normally used to display expensive
s h o e s in a flash boutique. Except there
is n o t h i n g o n display,- nice p a c k a g e ,
s h a m e about t h e contents.
tvery p h o t o is visually spectacular
even if t h e i n t e n d e d m e a n i n g is hardly
revolutionary. Try appreciating t h e m as
visual objects, rather than e n g a g i n g your
brain. After all, this exhibition is not earth-
quake material, but t h e massive size o f
each p h o t o a n d t h e fascinating subjects
m a k e it worth g o i n g to see.
