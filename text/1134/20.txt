333
I
O l d Street, EC1. Saturdays, £B/£8/£10,
10pm-5am, capacity - 600. Dress c o d e -
n o n e .
333 is t h e n a m e o f t h e club a n d t h e
night, well t h e night d o e s n ' t h a v e a
n a m e (neither d o e s their Friday night d o
as far as I can see). But d o e s this matter
o n e little bit? Well, o f course it doesn't.
As l o n g as e v e r y t h i n g is c h i l l e d a n d
groovy in t h e club then w h o cares about
big n a m e nights with w a n k y cult fol-
lowings? It's just as g o o d to g o to a n
u n p r e t e n t i o u s place like this w i t h its
o w n w a n k y cult f o l l o w i n g . There are
plenty of regulars a r o u n d o n t h e Satur-
day night, but these are nice locals - n o
attitude or s n o b b e r y is s h o w n to t h o s e
clearly visible n e w c o m e r s like myself. It
was as if I c o u l d have b e e n g o i n g to t h e
place for ages - a n d m a y b e I will in t h e
future.
I like most o f t h e clubs that I g o to
on your behalf (tough life, I know!), but
this o n e w a s especially fluffy. From w h a t
I've said a b o v e it is fairly clear that t h e
club is just as important in this instance
as the night. A n d if y o u w e n t there you'd
see w h y they mainly k e e p it to t h e m -
selves. 333 is set o n three different lev-
els (of course!), t h e base is m a d e o f
hard-edged D&B beats (with t h e c r o w d
j u m p i n g about all over t h e shop), in the
middle is your soft cheesy-house centre,
whilst the topping is an exquisite chill-out
r o o m (one of the best I've ever b e e n to).
In this r o o m w h e r e y o u can relax your
b o d y after a hard b o u n c e a r o u n d t h e
rest o f t h e premises, but not to twiddley,
mind-achingly b o r i n g n o n s e n s e by t h e
O r b a n d other assorted weirdos. N o ,
this is chill-out music with a distinct e d g e
to it. Soothing e n o u g h to be relaxing, but
still up-beat e n o u g h to keep that under-
lying f e e l i n g that y o u really want to g o
back a n d d a n c e o n the main dancefloor
at s o m e point s o o n .
I k n o w this is completely unprofes-
sional o f m e , but I can't r e m e m b e r w h o
any o f t h e DJs w e r e . No-one f a m o u s I
don't think, but that w a s a n d is the w h o l e
point. It just didn't matter. T h e residents
were stunning (both their mixing and the
tracks they played), the crowd w a s great,
the v e n u e w a s funky, a n d y o u even h a d
a choice o f loos to g o to (posh o n e s y o u
h a d to pay for a n d skanky fellas that
w e r e obviously free). Nice place - try it
out.
