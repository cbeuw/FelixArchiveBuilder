PoohShark (PSX)
Gremlin
It's a Pool g a m e . Yes I k n o w that y o u
probably t h o u g h t that t h e p o o l g a m e
had been d o n e to death a f e w years ago.
The last time the p o o l g e n r e w a s s e e n it
had several knives in its back a n d w a s
staggering d o w n a back alleyway. Pre-
s u m e d d e a d , Gremlin have f o u n d it a n d ,
following drastic surgery, have brought
it back to the streets with its n e w per-
sona; Pool-Shark. S o w h a t m a k e s Pool-
Shark better than all those g a m e s that
were released previously? Is Pool-Shark a
six-million dollar, fully bionic p o o l g a m e
or just a six dollar brush a n d shine job?
People r e m e m b e r i n g those old Pool
g a m e s c a n c o n j u r e u p t h e i m a g e o f
slightly s q u a s h e d , squared o f f balls mov-
ing o n a perfectly rectangular table.
Things have i m p r o v e d since t h e n . Pool-
Shark offers the c h a n c e t o play o n not
o n e type o f table but a w h o l e s h o p worth
of different tables. Play o n accurate Amer-
ican sized tables, UK p u b
tables, a n d even full size
s n o o k e r tables. Also the
type o f pool table affects
the background. A h h yes
the b a c k g r o u n d . O b v i -
ously the p r o g r a m m i n g
skills required to display
the table by itself w e r e
far b e n e a t h t h e pro-
g r a m m i n g t e a m , a n d s o
they have taken to plac-
ing the table in a virtual
r o o m ; s o US tables play
in either s m o k e y p o o l
clubs or airy A m e r i c a n
bar scenes. UK tables are placed in a pub-
ish a t m o s p h e r e , or a nice snooker club.
The p r o g r a m m e r s d i d t o y with t h e
Garage/Store virtual r o o m for the 4 ft kids
p o o l table effect, but left it out because
the older p r o g r a m m e r s w e r e c o m p l a i n -
i n g that that's really w h e r e their car
T'T:, : r
should be a n d if they did-
n't p a c k it a w a y t h e r e
w o u l d b e n o X-files.
But G r e m l i n have
not s t o p p e d there. In a n
attempt to m a k e this the
c o m p l e t e p o o l s i m u l a -
tion they m a n a g e d t o
sort out all o f the differ-
ent Rules sets. Unlike the
real world, y o u can find
out the rules before play-
ing a foul stroke a n d
there is n o o p p o n e n t
that suddenly admits that
p e r h a p s they really
s h o u l d have m e n t i o n e d that. Just t o
s h o w off they even have m a n a g e d to
use rules that allow different n u m b e r s o f
balls to b e used.
Pool, t h o u g h , is a two player g a m e .
W h a t h a p p e n s w h e n flatmates a n d
friends refuse t o play after they g e t
beaten for the tenth time
in a row? Luckily the pro-
g r a m m e r s have d e c i d e d
to include s o m e Al c o m -
puter o p p o n e n t s , f r o m
the c o m p l e t e l y i n c o m -
petent t o t h e frighten-
ingly g o o d p o o l shark
c r o w d .
So having captured
the width o f pool, h o w
I m u c h depth a n d length
I does PoohShark contain?
I T h e g r a p h i c s a r e crisp
' a n d the balls move along
the table amazingly like proper pool balls
- w h e r e players o f m y ability can snap the
cue ball into t h e pockets a n d off the
table with a n almost frighteningly regu-
larity.
PoohShark is a g o o d g a m e that has
b e e n spoilt by o n e thing. This o n e thing
is the control m e c h a n i s m . Instead o f tak-
ing advantage o f the analogue controller
a n d providing a control m e c h a n i s m like
A c t u a golf 3, (where the a n a l o g u e c o n -
troller controls the p o w e r o f the shot), it
is back to the old lining the c u e a n d the
ball up a n d t h e n pressing the button as
a p o w e r bar increases a n d decreases.
While everything else in the g a m e says
play m e , this control m e c h a n i s m says
k e e p your distance. Get used t o it a n d
the rest o f the g a m e is a delight. Defi-
nitely a try f r o m your v i d e o s h o p before
y o u buy.
