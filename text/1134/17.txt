Progression Sessions
T
he first t w o Logical progression
titles f r o m t h e last c o u p l e o f
years have b e e n heavy, fast,
loud a n d s a m p l e laden d r u m a n d bass
affairs ( w h o c o u l d forget that subliminal
Ferris Bueller sample?) a n d It w a s with
s o m e o p t i m i s m that I snaffled M r B's lat-
est studio offering.
The first impression is that o f a m o r e
vocal style, k e e p i n g the trademark d r u m
a n d bass drive b u t r o u n d i n g o f f t h e
edges o f t h e s o u n d , q u i e t i n g d o w n t h e
big beats a n d g e n e r a l l y c a l m i n g t h e
sound. H e has a d d e d a very professional
refinement to t h e a n a l o g u e treble lines;
reminiscent o f Orbital in their subtlety
and lightness o f t o u c h . T h e s a m p l i n g ,
too, has b e e n t a m e d t o a n infrequent
treat instead o f t h e staple (but wholly
nourishing) diet o f LTJ's previous works.
Sure e n o u g h , as t h e a l b u m continues,
the listener is drawn in, a n d the beats get
progressively harder a n d faster, m o v i n g
into garage territory.
The vocals t h o u g h , b e c o m e a minor
irritation with scant deviation from a very
small repertoire o f content a n d styles. For
m e , M C C o n r a d h a s a n awful lot t o say
a b o u t n o t h i n g . The quality o f t h e music
itself, gliding gently yet decisively f r o m
track to track, m o o d to m o o d , does more
than e n o u g h t o satisfy, but after only t e n
minutes or s o o f listening y o u are b e g -
g i n g for a c h a n g e . A different vocalist or
preferably an instrumental track? No, y o u
get y e t m o r e o f t h e u n r e l e n t i n g a n d
almost grating onslaught o f that s a m e
style, s h a m e l e s s l y a n d c o n t i n u o u s l y
extolling its o w n virtues. Even w h e n a
n e w rapper (DRSI believe) c o m e s in, his
style is largely undiscernable f r o m t h e
resident. It s e e m s a minor quibble, a n d
admittedly I've never b e e n a fan o f M C s
b a n g i n g o n a b o u t h o w p o w e r f u l t h e
groove is and w h y w e absolutely must lis-
ten t o it -1 w o u l d prefer it vastly if they
w o u l d bloody well shut u p a n d let m e .
A n d to b e fair, t h e further t h e a l b u m
g o e s , t h e m o r e intensely t h e m u s i c
c o m e s at y o u , a n d bloody g o o d it is too;
a rare instance in t h e creatively satu-
rated field o f d r u m a n d bass. A g a i n , the
a n a l o g u e effects have t h e potential t o
set it apart f r o m t h e c r o w d , b u t that
d a m n M C just w o n ' t shut up. It's like
b e i n g stuck in a c i n e m a with s o m e o n e
telling y o u h o w g o o d this bit is or to lis-
ten for this line because it is important
later: Just leave m e to it, OK? Great beats,
great bass, great atmosphere, great ana-
logue work, but, well, y o u g u e s s e d it...

m m m . W h e n I received this C D
I sat d o w n o n m y funky inflat-
able chair a n d slipped t h e C D
into m y hifi. All w a s well. But t h e n m y
eyes g l a n c e d d o w n at t h e sleeve notes
- Smog's style Is described as "Super
Sexy S p a c e C o w b o y " . O h dear, I
t h o u g h t . This d o e s n o t b o d e w e l l .
Luckily t h e music o n t h e c d d o e s rise
a b o v e the standard o f t h e sleeve notes.
But not by m u c h .
I s u p p o s e if I h a d to p i n s o m e influ-
ences o n this C h i c a g o b a n d , it w o u l d b e
Pink Floyd a n d REM. T h e lead singer has
a gravelly, gruff but tuneful voice a n d t h e
rest o f t h e b a n d s e e m t o b e well skilled
in their c h o s e n instruments. But while
s o m e tracks o n the a l b u m w o r k e d in a
simple a n d delicate way, I felt that s o m e
of t h e tunes s o u n d e d positively 'under
produced'. I appreciate that t h e b a n d
may b e trying t o m o v e a w a y f r o m t h e
highly t e c h n o l o g c a l m o d e r n s t u d i o
s o u n d but at times t h e s o n g s felt like
they n e e d e d a little fleshing out.
P r o d u c t i o n a r g u m e n t s aside t h e
lyrics themselves involve a lot o f thought
about h o w m o d e r n life is so anonymous,
a n d routine. The s o n g s detail fantasies
a b o u t c h a n c e enounter s with strangers.
On the Road-esque travels through t h e
c o u n t r y a n d b e y o n d . T h e s o n g w r i t e r
really s e e m s to feel e m p o w e r e d by c o n -
stant m o v e m e n t t h r o u g h his increas-
ingly m e a n i n g l e s s w o r l d . T h e lyrics really
help prop u p this a l b u m - with the " m i n -
imalist" instrumentation forcing y o u t o
concentrate o n t h e w o r d s b e i n g s u n g
m o r e than the rest o f t h e bands contri-
bution.
This is a n a l b u m o f contraditions
a n d half f o l l o w e d through ideas. After a
c o u p l e o f s o n g s in this delicate style
S m o g have fashioned themselves a l o n g
c o m e s a Spiritualised Come Together
style rouser, w h i c h shakes y o u u p , with
the help o f s o m e tight h a r m o n i z i n g a n d
the C h i c a g o childrens choir.
I think this a l b u m will probably g r o w
o n m e with repeated listenings but I
can't s e e it r e d e e m i n g itself to sufficent
levels to merit a higher score. S u m m i n g
up, this record has s o m e really beautiful
a n d delicate snatches o f brilliance in it -
but not e n o u g h to raise t h e standard
a b o v e average.

I
wasn't expecting to b e taken aback
by this a l b u m w h e n I picked it up,
but in c o n f i d e n c e to m y instincts, I
w a s right. That's not t o say that t h e
material is totally crap. O n t h e contrary,
s o m e o f it is very listenable a n d pleas-
ant. I actually played this a l b u m twice
within this w e e k a n d it s o u n d e d differ-
ent for t h e better o n t h e s e c o n d occa-
sion.
I wouldn't describe t h e s o u n d as
pure, "standard" raggae, if I may, it's
m o r e like a streetwise hip-hop beat rid-
ing o n s t r o n g raggae roots. N o t h i n g
stands out t o o m u c h apart from break
beats o n tracks such as Lovely M o r n i n g ,
w h i c h is a reviving track in its o w n right.
Ancient M e m o r i e s is a perfect e x a m p l e
of t h e hip-hop beats: m e l l o w a n d fresh
but the origin is f o u n d e d firm; strong
vocals a n d a beautiful c o m p l i m e n t o f
flute a n d string. That's as g o o d as it gets
o n this a l b u m .
The a l b u m is only listenable u p to
about half way. It just gets t o o b o r i n g
after that. I hear a lot o f t h e s a m e back-
beats o n m a n y o f the tracks but that's
just a probably a raggae thing. After a
while, it just s o u n d s like t h e s a m e thing
over a n d over - not g o o d .
You can probably guess w h i c h are
the only t w o g o o d tracks o n this a l b u m ,
but still not single material. It this a l b u m
is meant t o p r o m o t e raggae then I'm
not impressed. If it's just s o m e t h i n g Siz-
zla felt like d o i n g in his spare t i m e then
he s h o u l d n ' t have b o t h e r e d . D o n ' t
expect t o see this g o platinum. El

O n first listen I really just did not get this.
H o w e v e r next t i m e r o u n d It m a d e per-
fect sense. The s o n g is all about the joys

upbeat Sinatra-esque style. Alter a tew

y o u fault a s o n g with t h e lines 'Miniskirts
