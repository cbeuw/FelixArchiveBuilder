BASKETBALL
King's 73 - 76 Imperial
The first match of the n e w year for the
IC Basketball 1 sts was a real thriller! It was
the quarter-final of the UL C u p against
King's. For IC's o p p o n e n t s , it w a s a
chance for revenge for their BUSA defeat
earlier in the season. The way the match
started, n o t h i n g s h o w e d h o w t h i n g s
w o u l d eventually turn out. In most of the
first half, IC w e r e very c o n v i n c i n g d e f e n -
sively a n d a p p e a r e d to take a p e m a n e n t
lead w h e n they w e n t up 32-17 four m i n -
utes before the e n d of the half.
At that point s o m e strategic mistakes
f r o m IC's b e n c h as well as a n u m b e r of
silly errors by the players gave the oppor-
tunity for King's to r e d u c e the differ-
e n c e to 4 points by half time.
FOOTBALL
UCLVI 1 - ICVI 7
If y o u t h o u g h t Fulham at Villa was a
g o o d report, this was better. A cup-tie
played o n a blustery afternoon was short-
e n e d to 40 minutes e a c h way after the
coach driver d e c i d e d to take the scenic
route.
The first half contained all IC pres-
sure, at times it s e e m e d that they had a
m a n less! The excellent stand in defence
spent most of their half c a m p e d out in
the centre circle toasting marshmallows,
it truly was t u m b l e w e e d time for goalie
"Charger" Collins. The first c a m e from a
corner, the ball falling to u n m a r k e d
"Stan" Booth w h o drove it in. A pile dri-
ver u n l e a s h e d by "Wild thing" Williams
after continual flair from "Ginolaah" Giret
gave us our s e c o n d .
The final goal of the half started
w i t h a great tackle by captain "The
Gaffer" Davenport, neat passing across
the field led by a first time cross f r o m
"Rivaldo" Raval a n d a superb yet simple
header f r o m Stan.
IC, playing uphill a n d into the w i n d
in the s e c o n d half w e r e further playing
The s e c o n d half was o n e of the closest
g a m e s played by IC in the last f e w years,
with both t e a m s within 2-5 points of
each other all t h r o u g h the half. IC was
led by Guillermo San M i g u e l w h o s e e m s
to be finding his best shape, right before
the B U S A knock-outs. The forwards,
S i m o n B r c n n a n offensively a n d Elias
lliadis defensively a d d e d to the pace set
by the IC play-maker. At the e n d , King's
performance was not e n o u g h to give the
ticket to the semi-finals.
A d e t e r m i n e d IC w o n the tie 76-73 a n d
progressed, despite the 4 unsuccessful
desperate 3-pointers shot in the last 1 2 "
by King's s h o o t i n g guards.
IC n o w have the c h a n c e to repeat the
a c h i e v e m e n t of the previous two years,
qualifying to the best 16 University teams
of Britain.
w e a k e n e d w h e n Ginolaaah was hit by a
strong tackle 2 minutes in. However, his
r e p l a c e m e n t , " S u p c r s u b " Raby, w a s
immediately released d o w n the right by
wild thing and his touchline cross (he
said shot) floated over the keeper. "The
D o c " Wilson finally scored after missing
a hatful a n d w e let t h e m t h r o u g h to
gain a consolation goal (we w e r e Stan's
hattrick c a m e after a quick throw from
the Doc but he was not best pleased at
his i m m e d i a t e substitution, leading to
later threats of refusing to score.
O u r final goal constituted superb
t e a m play, Wild Thing passing to Big Al,
w h o set Rivaldo off. He laid it to the Doc
w h o duly returned the favour and Rivaldo
f o u n d the top c o r n e r f r o m distance.
Rivaldo later said that he took a long time
c o m i n g , but w h e n he did it was spec-
tacular, s h o o t i n g over 20 yards.
The Gaffer, please dwith his Gor-
d o n Strachan i m p r e s s i o o n in the sec-
o n d half, stated (paying all d u e respect)
that "today was a bit of a holiday because
they w e r e crap".
Even t h o u g h at times w e w e r e a bit
r a n d o m , it w o r k e d a n d w e s t o r m e d
through to the quarter finals.
RUGBY
C+G 50-13 RSM
fhis was it, the last match in the C+G
sparkes c u p c a m p a i g n . Victory w o u l d
give the s w e e t smell of success and
metallic taste of beer drunk f r o m a tro-
phy.
Ihe RSM line up was full of strong
players led by the mighty c o c k n e y w h o
forgot, to his teams detriment, that w e
w e r e playing union(not league Matt).
C+G, g o d bless ' e m , turned up with
m o r e than the legally prescribed n u m -
ber of players so could make a m e n d s for
his school boy error by the tax-free dona-
tion of Peter "the flying lock". O n e man
d o w n they got off to a flyer and crashed
(wind assisted) d o w n the pitch to put
over a penalty. After a short dose of
electric s h o c k therapy C+G w e r e up to
our old tricks again demonstrated ably
by Will Stevns r u n n i n g through the RSM
seal impressions. Chris duly " m i s s e d "
the c onv e r sion to m a k e it 7-3. RSM's Y
fronts w e r e b r o w n e d a f e w minutes
later by our boy crasher H y d e took a
stroll t h r o u g h a casual d e f e n c e before
e x e c u t i n g a 9.5 dive under the posts.
The miners c o n t i n u e d to do what
they d o best a n d e n t r e n c h e d t h e m -
selves in our 22 eventually tunnelling
over the line. It all proved worthless as
w e forged back up the pitch with scores
f r o m our lads Rich a n d Sven.
24-8 at half t i m e meant the miners
had d u g t h e m s e l v e s into a very d e e p
hole. R u m o u r s of pies under our posts
brought resurgent action f r o m captain
cockerel w h o drilled over to score after
a small technical foul by the fullback. It
w a s a false d a w n , the rumours fools
g o l d , the try fest b e g a n . W h e n the
s m o k e cleared C+G had n o t c h e d up
s o m e notable a c h i e v e m e n t s . The first
subterranean drop-goal, a m a x i m u m 10
points dive f r o m davo, Charlie's con-
version, Mikes' first sprint over 20 metres
a n d 50 big o n e s .
Thanks also to Ashley Jarvis for c o m -
ing out to Harlington to administer.
