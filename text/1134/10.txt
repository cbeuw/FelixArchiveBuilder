Facilities
W e ' v e just finished putting together our
lovely n e w m i x i n g a n d editing facility.
Over t h e last f e w years, U n i o n f u n d i n g
has e n a b l e d us to b u y pretty m u c h all
the kit that's n e e d e d to k n o c k u p t o p

O u r system is based r o u n d a four
source professional digital vision mixer,
a n d a seriously fast PC editing system.
W e also have professional quality tape
m a c h i n e s , a n d t w o broadcast cameras.
S o u n d is based a r o u n d a 16 c h a n n e l
mixer, with e n o u g h m i c r o p h o n e s to
record anything really well. Significant
further e x p e n d i t u r e is p l a n n e d over the
next year to improve audio facilities even

People like you?
Like a n y society, stoic is only as g o o d as
its m e m b e r s . It takes a lot o f w o r k to put
together a TV p r o g r a m m e , a n d w e ' r e
always l o o k i n g for p e o p l e w h o ' d like to
get involved. There is an incredible b u z z
a b o u t p u t t i n g t o g e t h e r p r o g r a m m e s ,
especially w h e n w e ' r e broadcasting live.
If you fancy trying your hand at c a m -
era work, p r o d u c i n g a p r o g r a m m e , or as
a presenter w e ' d love to hear f r o m you.
Alternatively, there are always jobs for
people w h o ' d like to d o s o m e t h i n g tech-
nical. In particular, w e n e e d p e o p l e
w h o ' d like to w o r k o n s o m e really inter-
esting software projects.
We're always responsive to people's
views o n w h a t stoic s h o u l d b e d o i n g . If

Presidential Talk-Back
After all of my m o a n David Hellard, ICU President
ing over the last f e w m
articles, it s time to
report back o n move- | i |
ments in the College
and the U n i o n . | | | |
I irst of all, here's
a list of discounts that
w e can get in High
Street K e n s i n g t o n
(note only HSK) with » ™
an ICU card. There are still tens o f c o m -
panies I have to p h o n e in order to get
authorisation from above, but here goes:
1 0 % o f f at: HiTek, Top G u n , Lon-
don:Dallas Pizza a n d Pasta (if over £10 a
head), Kensington Leather, Market
Leather, Blazer, Jeans West, SONAKens-
ington, Blacks, YHA Adventure Shop, 1 hr
Photos, Footlights (Food only).
Plus: Tumblers (15% off food); The Stu-
dio ( 2 5 % off cuts) a n d Hair at Fairy (£1 off
a cut a n d 1 0 % off anything else).
Secondly, there's also g o o d news o n
the library front, although not for a w h i l e .
Next year the College is g o i n g to have an
experimental year o f o p e n i n g the library
o n Sundays until 6 p m ; let's h o p e that it
proves to be the success w e k n o w it will
be. They are also looking into o p e n i n g
later than 9 p m o n weekdays. The Health
Centre is probably g o i n g to o p e n later; as
for lunchtime o p e n -
ings, we're still push-
ing.
Next up, as the
Union has received so
m a n y letters o f c o m -
plaint about the Lon-
d o n Transport
s c h e m e (please keep
t h e m coming), that if
you hand t h e m into
the U n i o n reception, w e will check them
and then send t h e m by recorded delivery
once a w e e k (thanks to A n d r e w Southern
for that idea). So n o w they'll reject you
within days, not keep your p o u n d and
there'll b e n o chance of your application
being lost o f stolen.
The College is introducing a formal
complaints procedure for students. This
will allow y o u to monitor what is hap-
p e n i n g to any complaints y o u m a y have
about the College a n d give different lev-
els at which they can be settled, ranging
from a College Tutor to possibly a Gover-
nor o f t h e College Council.
I h o p e that this gives y o u a bit more
confidence that the College and the Union
are working to try a n d m a k e your life at
Imperial that little bit easier. If you have
any other problems email as ever presl-
dent@lc.ac.uk.
