Mr Roger Davis, Cater-
ing M a n a g e r for
Imperial College, d i e d unexpectedly o n
W e d n e s d a y 20 January. M r Davis col-
lapsed suddenly while in his office. H e
was 59 years old.
M e d i c a l help w a s quickly provided
by security a n d t h e first aiders o n duty.
Dr Peter Dorward w a s immediately called
to t h e s c e n e f r o m t h e Health Centre, as
were paramedics. The first aiders initiated
attempts to resuscitate M r Davis, but
w e r e unsuccessful. M r Davis w a s then
taken to Chelsea a n d Westminster Hos-
pital, w e r e he w a s p r o n o u n c e d d e a d
shortly after arrival. Dr Dorward c o m -
m e n t e d "it is a tragic story", explaining
that It is very rare for resuscitation to be
successful in such situations.
M r Davis joined the Catering Division
By Ed Sexton of Imperial College in
O c t o b e r 1995. He
played a n active role in college life, both
professionally a n d socially, a n d w a s a
m e m b e r o f several IC clubs. H e w a s also
the C h a i r m a n o f t h e European Caterers
Association.
M r J o h n Foster, Head o f Catering
a n d C o n f e r e n c e Services at t h e college,
described M r Davis as "well respected
and well liked". H e explained that, "every-
o n e w a s very very shocked", but "every-
b o d y has b e e n very supportive". Dr
Dorward singled out t h e first-aiders for
particular praise, stating that "[they] did
a t r e m e n d o u s job... it w a s particularly
traumatic for them."
M r Davis' funeral will take place this
afternoon ( M o n d a y ) . H e leaves behind
his partner a n d o n e s o n .
ICSM lost their BUSA premiership playoff to Newcastle by 16 points to 13. The match
was played In Banbury last Wednesday, and was a playoff between the winners of
the Northern England and Southern England divisions. About 200 IC supporters
cheered the team on, far out weighing the six Newcastle fans present.
Quiz Soc
By Sunil Rao
The ICU Q u i z Society w a s formed in Jan-
uary 1998 to provide a platform for the
hosting of quiz tournaments here at Impe-
rial as well as the selection a n d prepara-
tion of teams to represent Imperial College
for various other inter-collegiate tourna-
ments, particularly University Challenge
o n national television - Imperial w e r e the
deserving victors in 1996. If you're itching
to face a barrage of questions from Paxo,
here's your chance!
Within w e e k s o f formation, the soci-
ety organised QuizIC, Imperial's very o w n
national intercollegiate quiz tournament.
QuizIC, which was held in the Blackett Lab-
oratory o n 28 M a r c h last year, w a s a suc-
cess with nine teams in all participating.
QuizIC '98 w a s w o n by Balllol College
Oxford despite g o o d performances by
Durham, Trinity (Cantab), Oriel (Oxon) and
of course Imperial!
QuizIC is back this year; hopefully
bigger a n d better than before. The plan is
to invite more colleges this year. The event
will b e hosted early o n in the Summer
term a n d t h e society is o n the lookout for
people willing to moderate a n d score the
various rounds, to get in touch with poten-
tial sponsors a n d n u m e r o u s other jobs. If
you're interested in helping out in anyway
possible or fancy taking part at part of the
Imperial College team, just email the soci-
ety at quiz@ic.ac.uk or simply turn up for
the meeting at 1 P M o n Thursday (feb
