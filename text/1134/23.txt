Premier Manager '99 (PSX)
Gremlin
It's sports s i m u l a t i o n s a go-go in t h e
games towers again. But for o n c e t h e
g a m e is not golf - s h a m e as I h a d b e e n
rehersing all o f m y divot a n d ball puns all
week. N o , it's Gremlin's Premier M a n a g e r
'99, a football m a n a g e m e n t g a m e for the
Playstation owner with t o o m u c h time o n
their hands. Those w h o have relation-
ships with t h e opposite sex might just as
well get t h e m to pack their bags a n d
leave for Antarctica, for if y o u like foot-
ball m a n a g e m e n t g a m e s y o u might just
be paying t h e m slightly less attention
for t h e next f e w m o n t h s .
Enough hype, what about the g a m e .
H o w d o e s it c o m p a r e against C h a m p i -
o n s h i p M a n a g e r 2, o r e v e n C h a m p i -
o n s h i p M a n a g e r 3 (as if I've b e e n
allowed to s e e that little beauty!). Well
The a. Sep .'98...
b e i n g a Playstation g a m e there is a cer-
tain e m p h a s i s o n form, but fortunately
not at the cost o f function. The graphics
have b e e n heavily r e v a m p e d since t h e
last version, with a n e w front e n d , a n d
several revamped tactical screens. The '99
edition has also finally g o n e fully inter-
national, with both Italian a n d English
leagues r u n n i n g parallel (yeah I k n o w
that C M 2 d i d that a w h i l e a g o , but
r e m e m b e r that's playing the 16 M b g a m e
o n a PC w h i l e here y o u are r u n n i n g it o n
s o m e t h i n g with slightly less grunt).
Another complexity is that training n o w
occurs o n a one-to-one basis. Working o n
G a s c o i g n e ' s fitness at t h e e x p e n s e o f
his skills, rather than m a k i n g t h e w h o l e
of t h e side neglect their skill training is
possible (even poor old sick note Darren

might finally make it through ninety min-
utes before h e loses another ligament).
Picking the side a little t o o tedious for
your managerial post? I here is an option
to allow the Al to select the best t e a m for
the formation selected - t h o u g h if y o u d o
select this option y o u arc not taking t h e
g a m e seriously (bit like those cheats w h o
select automatic gears for t h e driving
games).
Off the pitch a n d in t h e office, it's a
case o f balancing the books. The ability
to improve the facilities and increase the
stadium capacity a r c t w o o f t h e n e w
ways t o s p e n d a fortune ( t h o u g h n o
retractable pitch or roof options have
b e e n i n c l u d e d - s o your s t a d i u m will
never b e perfect). To b a l a n c e t h e s e
improvements m o n e y can b e brought in
from sponsors. Obviously starting from
the third division t h e sponsors y o u are
g o i n g to get are not g o i n g to b e s p e n d -
ing a lot o f cash, but bring s o m e success
to t h e club a n d t h e m o n e y might start
rolling in. W h e r e there is pleasure there
is also the flip side o f pain. Bring the sort
of success that Reading or Manchester C.
w e r e enjoying last s e a s o n a n d there is a
fair c h a n c e that the chairman might well
give a vote o f c o n f i d e n c e , just before
o p e n i n g t h e d o o r t o t h e virtual j o b cen-
tre.
Worth the m o n e y ? f o r all those sta-
tistic junkies, football m a n a g e m e n t sim-
ulation addicts a n d u n w a s h e d with t o o
m u c h time it is m o r e than a worthy suc-
cessor t o Premier M a n a g e r '98. Those
w h o have never played a football m a n -
ager g a m e , select t h e automatic team
picking function a n d it might just lose
y o u a w e e k or t w o (time travelling for-
wards rather than backwards). It is sim-
ply t h e best football m a n a g e m e n t
simulator o n the Playstation.
