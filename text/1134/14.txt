Hilary and Jackie * * * * *
Starring : Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, James Frain, David Morrissey, Charles Dance, Celia Imrie
Director: Anand Tucker
T
here are certain genres for w h i c h
British c i n e m a is r e n o w n e d : cos-
t u m e drama,- bittersweet c o m e d y ;
hard-hiting d r a m a ; e v e n romantic c o m -
edy. Yet despite b e i n g a c c l a i m e d as o n e
of t h e finest British m o v i e s o f t h e
decade, Hilary and Jackie contains n o n e
of these elements. O r all o f t h e m - let
m e explain.
In its simplest sense, it's a biopic o f
legendary cellist Jacqueline D u Pre (Wat-
son), w h o rose to f a m e in sixties London,
b e c o m i n g t h e most f a m o u s classical
musician o f her day. But far m o r e impor-
tantly, it's the story o f her relationship
with her sister Hilary (Griffiths), a n d h o w ,
despite almost identical childhoods, their
lives take almost diametrically o p p o s e d
courses. Both are musically gifted, but it
is the highly competitive nature o f their
relationship w h i c h spurs Jackie o n t o
greatness whilst Hilary leads a ' n o r m a l '
life.
At t h e s a m e t i m e , h o w e v e r , it's
funny - as both Hilary a n d Jackie battle
with their parents to explore sixties lib-
eration - a n d heartwrenching - as Jackie
begins to slide towards her tragic e n d .
A n d there are romantic subplots t o o ,

Jacqueline Du Pr&. Have cello, will travel..
revolving a r o u n d t h e sisters marriage
a n d Jackie's obsession with sex.
Despite the quality o f the story, how-
ever, it's t h e construction o f t h e m o v i e
that really deserves t h e highest praise.
Director Tucker's only previous directing
credit c a m e with Saint-Ex, a n arthouse
biopic hardly ever seen in this country.
This time a r o u n d , h e has ditched t h e
strange c a m e r a effects, d o c u m e n t a r y
feel a n d surreal style, instead favouring
a m o r e a u d i e n c e friendly (although still
non-linear) a p p r o a c h . Having f o l l o w e d
the sisters through their c o m m u n a l child-
h o o d , t h e story then splits in two, first fol-
l o w i n g Hilary's life, a n d then Jackie's,
fair e n o u g h , it's hardly an original idea,
but here it's briliantly played out, as t h e
t w o sisters lives drift apart a n d then sud-
denly b e c o m e o n e once again, with their
relationship e b b i n g a n d f l o w i n g like the
sea. It has to b e a sign o f quality w h e n
you s e e a s c e n e repeated within twenty
minutes, yet arc happy for that repitition.
Put together with s o m e terrific act-
ing f r o m t h e cast o f u n k n o w n s (plus a
surprisingly up-beat p e r f o r m a n c e from
Charles Dance), this m a k e s for a brilliant
m o v i e . A n d t h e n t h e m u s i c b e g i n s .
J a c q u e l i n e D u Pre's t r a d e m a r k piece,
Elgar's Piano Concerto, is used to per-
fection, sparingly reserved for t w o or
three key m o m e n t s w h e n its swelling roll
will s e n d a chill d o w n your spine. Pow-
erful, e m o t i o n a l a n d heartfelt, Hilary and
Jackie is without a d o u b t t h e best British
m o v i e of at least t h e last twelve m o n t h s
- give praise o n c e m o r e to those w o n -
derful p e o p l e at C h a n n e l Four films -
a n d deserves every o u n c e o f praise that
it receives. T h e Oscars are there for the
winning.... fl

Bulworth
Starring : Sean Astin, Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Piatt, Don Cheadle, Graham Beckel, Paul Sorvino
Director: Warren Beatty
T
hanks to t h e A m e r i c a n political
rollercoaster that is t h e Clinton
administration, w e s e e m to b e
inundated with 'clever' political thrillers
at the m o m e n t . Primary Colours w a s a
thinly veiled c o m m e n t a r y o n America's
growing distrust o f its politicians, whilst
Wag The Dog o p t e d t o reality in favour
of satire. So, is Bulworth f r o m t h e s a m e
stable?
The simple answer is n o . T h e pitch
behind the movie rests almost entirely o n
that terrifying phrase 'Warren Beatty rap-
ping'. It's a truly terrifying concept that he
barely m a n a g e s to pull off - but not with-
out s o m e w o r r y i n g s u g g e s t i o n s that a
large part o f t h e A m e r i c a n electorate
can only understand h i m if h e raps his
campaign. C o n s i d e r i n g Beatty is a pillar
of the US liberal m o v e m e n t , it's a very
worrying attitude. M o r e o v e r , Bulworth
isn't rooted in fascination with Clintons.
It's a satire about the ethos o f US politics;
the o v e r r i d i n g them-and-us d y n a m i c
w h i c h separates t h e politicians from t h e
poorer half o f their electorate. Beatty
Warren Beatty and Halle Berry. Surely there's something wrong there?
s e e m s to honestly believe that if o n e
middle-class politico actually experienced
real life in the slums then all America's
p r o b l e m s w o u l d b e solved. H o w sweet.
Senator Bulworth (Beatty) is running
for re-election a n d f a c i n g a n e r v o u s
breakdown. He suddenly decides that his
life is worthless, a n d puts a contract out
o n his o w n life. With n o t h i n g left to live
for, h e finally decides to start telling t h e
truth. H e tells a black a u d i e n c e that no-
o n e will ever m a k e their lives better
b e c a u s e they don't give m o n e y to c a m -
paign funds; h e g o e s to all night parties
a n d o p e n l y takes drugs; a n d , a b o v e all,
he raps.
Thanks to s o m e g o o d support from
the likes o f Halle Berry, as t h e inquisitive
love-interest, a n d Oliver Piatt, as Beatty's
long-suffering aide, it almost works. But
only almost. Ultimately, Bulworth can't
decide w h a t kind o f movie it wants to be
- Beatty clearly wants to make a point, yet
the inclusion o f c o m e d y hit-men only
serve t o w e a k e n t h e m e s s a g e . M o r e -
over, it's a m e s s a g e that applies to a
fantasy world w h e r e South Central LA
w o u l d b e prepared to accept a US Sen-
ator in their midst. If n o t h i n g else, it's
impossible to take any image or message
away from t h e film apart from the endur-
ing picture o f W a r r e n Beatty w e a r i n g
baggy trousers a n d a beanie hat a n d
r a p p i n g a political address. A surreal
experience. 1 3
