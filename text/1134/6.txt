Dear Felix,
Last w e e k ' s "competitive" m a t c h report
entitled " S i l w o o d S t o m p o n IC 6ths"
has p r o m p t e d m e to write this letter at
l o n g last. As captain o f t h e sixths it h a s
b e c o m e a p p a r e n t t o m e that a n y o n e
f o l l o w i n g o u r p r o g r e s s in your p u b l i -
cation has s o far read only a b o u t s e v e n
goal reversals to R S M II a n d S i l w o o d
Park, a n d m a y infact t h i n k that o u r 3-2
w i n at lowly H e y t h r o p C o l l e g e is o u r
only positive result o f t h e s e a s o n ! Let
m e e n l i g h t e n y o u a l l , a n d h o p e f u l l y
s h o w y o u that w e a r e n o t a w a s t e o f
space, as m a n y o f y o u m u s t think.
It is true that w e s u f f e r e d a n i g n o -
m i n i o u s start t o t h e s e a s o n . A largely
i n e x p e r i e n c e d side s u c c u m b e d t o t w o
heavy defeats b y t h e b i g b o y s o f Divi-

A creditable 3-3 d r a w a g a i n s t t h e

s o m e reason) started o u r revival,since
w h e n w e h a v e w o n o u r last t h r e e

the process. O u r t r e m e n d o u s r u n o f

R e g a r d i n g t h e S i l w o o d Park g a m e ,

used by myself to try o u t s q u a d players,

a c h i e v e d this s e a s o n , s o if t h e u n i o n is

'Lay Off The Pills!' Reply
Dear Sir,
I write in response t o last w e e k ' s anony-
m o u s letter, 'Lay O f f the Pills!', regarding
m y article ' A g o n y or Ecstasy?' w h i c h
a p p e a r e d in Felix t h e previous w e e k .
' A n o n y m o u s ' has missed t h e point
so dramatically that I w o n d e r if s/he actu-
ally read t h e article at all. Everyone else
I've had feedback from has got the point,
but for A n o n y m o u s ' benefit, I'll state it
again. I a m not saying 'never take ecstasy
again1
; a n d nor a m I saying 'ecstasy will
kill you'. W h a t I a m pointing out is that
Es c a n , a n d d o , cause long-term brain
d a m a g e . Fact. A d a m - w h o , incidentally,
was real (and I didn't exaggerate his c o n -
dition either) - w a s a w a l k i n g e x a m p l e of
what pills can do. I personally believe that
a balance c a n b e struck b e t w e e n enjoy-
ing yourself whilst reducing the risk; that,
of course, is d o w n t o t h e individual.
Q u i t e w h e r e A n o n y m o u s g o t t h e
idea that I've never taken pills, or i n d e e d
that I've h a d a b a d experience, I really
don't k n o w . If s/he'd b o t h e r e d to read
the first paragraph s/he'd know, unequiv-
ocally, that I have - a n d loved it. Clearly,
A n o n y m o u s simply can't handle the facts,
a n d is lashing out at r a n d o m ; t h e reac-
tion is fairly typical o f t h o s e drug-
o b s e s s e d paranoids w h o like t o think
the w h o l e w o r l d is o u t to stop t h e m
f r o m having a g o o d time. That A n o n y -
m o u s lacks t h e guts even to sign their
n a m e proves s/he falls into this cate-
gory. Let us just h o p e that s/he, a n d
t h o s e like h i m , g r o w u p s o o n a n d learn
to b e sensible b e f o r e t o o m u c h brain
d a m a g e is d o n e .
Yours sincerely,
Sarah Rutt
Mascotry Revenge?
Dear Black Hole Squad,
W e are very disturbed to learn that after
the theft o f Sedrick Safe, "the safe is n o
longer safe." H o w e v e r w e have recently
learnt that Sedrick m a y still contain s o m e
valuable items. W e w o u l d be very dis-
pleased if a n y h a r m w e r e to c o m e to
these.
G o o d luck in f i n d i n g Sedrick, I h o p e
the rumour that the miners have him isn't
true, they won't treat h i m properly a n d
that w o u l d be just terrible. W e will o f
c o u r s e c o n s i d e r a n y r a n s o m that is
d e m a n d e d , only w h e n y o u can prove
possession o f Sedrick.
W e a r e all praying that Sedrick is
safe a n d well.

Wade In More...
Dear Felix,
I write regarding t h e events o n t h e M l
during t h e M e d i c s ' Rag Dash; or to b e
m o r e precise, r e g a r d i n g t h e I C S M S U
hierarchy's reaction to t h e m . I myself
a m a first year m e d i c a n d I find it wor-
rying that t h e president o f m y u n i o n
t o o k it u p o n himself to a d m o n i s h t h o s e
of m y friends w h o w e r e u n f o r t u n a t e
e n o u g h to b e caught u p in this matter.
That is not to say that I consider t h o s e
students blameless; they w e r e foolish, if
not d o w n r i g h t stupid to walk a l o n g a
busy motorway, but surely e v e n stupid
students s h o u l d be able to rely o n t h e
support o f their union?
I s h o u l d like to point out to W a d e
that t h e C o l l e g e d o c s not e m p l o y h i m
a n d his officers. H e is not a n s w e r a b l e to
the Dean, but to us, the students, includ-
ing those w h o h e treated so appallingly,
m i d w a y t h r o u g h a n already stressful
ordeal. I can s e e that as president, W a d e
couldn't g o o n TV a n d say that larking
about o n the M l w a s a great thing to d o ;
my c o n c e r n is that h e couldn't bring
himself to express his support to t h o s e
c o n c e r n e d in private. Or m a y b e W a d e
feels that as president, h e h a s a r e s p o n -
sibility to t h e 'wider c o m m u n i t y ' a n d
other sorts o f crap like that w h i c h forces
h i m to override hid gut reaction, w h i c h
(hopefully) w o u l d have b e e n to reas-
sure T h e M l s e v e n ' that e v e r y t h i n g
w o u l d b e O K . Sorry, W a d e ; that won't
w a s h ; it's all or n o t h i n g : either you're a
s t u d e n t a n d s u p p o r t t h e rest o f us
t h r o u g h w h a t e v e r scrapes w e get into,
or you're not a n d y o u don't. If y o u c o n -
sider yourself not to be a student, or not
able to identify with - or at least offer
c o m f o r t to - t h o s e o f our c o l l e a g u e s
w h o got into this mess, t h e n w h a t t h e
hell are y o u d o i n g at the head o f our stu-
dents' union?

Good Show From The
Hockey Thirds
Dear Felix,
In response to the report (1133) o n the
match b e t w e e n the IC a n d ICSM men's
III hockey clubs, I w o u l d like to say I a m
glad to s e e that there is a strong sense
of irony a m o n g a team that w a s well
b e a t e n o n t h e day. S u c h a s h o w o f
sportsmanship is c o m m e n d a b l e in a n y
team. Thanks for the g a m e a n d I look for-
w a r d to our next m e e t i n g ,

Who's Afraid OfTheQT?
Dear Felix,
Yet again s o m e m e m b e r s o f t h e a d m i n -
istration staff in Sherfield have proved
h o w high a n d mighty they are. W h e n I
c o n t a c t e d a certain m e m b e r o f t h e
Estates Division about t h e possibility of
arranging a s p o n s o r e d abseil f r o m the
Q u e e n ' s Tower for Rag, t h e response
w a s particularly m i n i m a l i s t i c . In fact,
b e t w e e n all t h e staff in the afore m e n -
tioned division, they apparently did not
have t h e time to reply by p h o n e or e-
mail, never m i n d a letter. W h e n I deliv-
ered the letter to t h e person in question,
I discovered that their office h a d m o v e d .
W h e n I eventually f o u n d t h e n e w office
I inquired as to w h e t h e r this w a s in fact
the Estates Division - o n e of the members
of staff helpfully replied, 'It might be,
w h o ' s asking?'. Is this the w a y w e really
want m e m b e r s o f staff o f O U R college to
behave?
