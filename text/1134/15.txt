Y
uck. I don't have a p r o b l e m with
sentimental movies. I don't have a
p r o b l e m with crying in t h e c i n e m a
(I frequently do) but w h a t I d o have a
problem with is a n y m o v i e that tries at
every turn t o m a k e y o u ball your eyes
out a n d call f o r m o r e K l e e n e x .
Stepmom is such a movie.
Problem n u m b e r o n e is definitely
the choice o f director. Chris C o l u m b u s
has c o m e to f a m e via Home Alone, Mrs
Doubtflre a n d Nine Months. This is not
the guy y o u want to put at t h e h e l m o f
a depressing w e e p i e with hardly a laugh
in sight. Thus, w e ' r e left with a n irritating
muddle o f a movie, plus s o m e really,
really a n n o y i n g kids.
O n t h e other h a n d , t h e biggest plus
comes in t h e f o r m o f the cast. Roberts
and Sarandon are in typically g o o d f o r m
(and a r e b o t h hotly t i p p e d for O s c a r
nomination), both p r o d u c i n g their best
work for s o m e time. Roberts d o e s well to
win sympathy in t h e role o f 'the other
w o m a n ' in Ed Harris' life, w h o struggles
to look after his kids. M e a n w h i l e Saran-
don finds t h e entire audience rooting for
her as s h e gives u p her children, despite
regarding Roberts' efforts as appalingly
15
Old bald bloke gets Julia Roberts. Clearly a believable plot there then...
insufficient.
It's a n incredibly cheesy tale, as their
c o m b i n e d maternal instincts force t h e
t w o w o m e n t o get o n , despite t h e fact
that they hate each other a n d have dia-
metrically o p p o s e d outlooks o n life. This
conflict is d e e p e n e d w h e n S a r a n d o n
s u d d e n l y discovers that s h e has cancer,
a n d (of course) has to give u p the chil-
dren s o that they can get used to their
n e w mother....Somewhere in this pitiful
tale is Harris, in unfamiliar territory a n d
completely out o f his depth.
Stepmom serves only o n e useful
purpose - to s h o w c a s e t h e talents o f its
two stars. Sadly, just because it contains
t w o g o o d p e r f o r m a n c e s , that doesn't
m e a n it's worth seeing. It's not - so don't.
Unless you're g o i n g to t h e c i n e m a with
your m u m - in w h i c h case take five
boxes of tissues. Q

Harrison ford, o n a desert island, b e i n g
brave a n d getting t h e girl - surely a win-
n i n g c o m b i n a t i o n ? Sadly, n o is t h e
a n s w e r . Its a n o b v i o u s , entirely pre-
dictable movie, that relies o n a plot that
c o u l d have b e e n lifted out o f a boys
o w n adventure.
The plane in w h i c h l o r d is flying
A n n e H e c h e (famed for her relationship
with Ellen D e G e n r e s m o r e than h e r
m o v i e career) across t h e South Seas is
hit by lightning, they crash land, they
argue, they fight pirates, they escape,
they fall in love. Yawn, tord seems to be
attempting t o recreate H a n Solo - but
m o v e d to t h e South Pacific twenty years
o n it just doesn't work.
Replacement
Killers
At last, with t h e success o f Jackie Chan
in Rush Hour and Jet Li in Lethal Weapon
Lour, t h e stars o f H o n g K o n g c i n e m a
s e e m t o have m a d e their mark o n Hol-
l y w o o d . Sadly, however, The Replace-
ment Killers hasn't h a d the s a m e kind o f
effect o n t h e career o f C h o w Yun-Fat.
That's hardly a n injustice, t h o u g h , as
this m o v i e isn't a n y w h e r e near t h e usu-
ally high standards o f t h e diminutive
star. The gunplay is g o o d a n d there are
s o m e brilliantly over-the-top action
s e q u e n c e s , but the c h o r e o g r a p h y isn't
up to scratch, leaving the movie without
the crucial ' w o w ' factor.
Lost in Space
Lost in Space is w o r t h renting for t w o
reasons. Firstly, t h e fight with t h e space
spiders o n board t h e mystery space-sta-
tion is breathtakingly g o o d , splattering
state-of-the-art effects liberally across
the screen. Secondly, Matt Le Blanc's
p e r f o r m a n c e is hilarious - it's basically
Joey in space. O n the other hand, Lost
in Space isn't w o r t h renting twice for
o n e (simple) reason - t h e p l o t . It does-
n't m a k e a n y sense. At all. It only serves
to link t h e effects shots (750 in all)
together - a n d it e v e n d o e s that badly.
Basically, it's a kiddies m o v i e through
and through. O n e to rent o n a rainy Sun-
day a f t e r n o o n . D
