PRINCE PAUL
A Prince Among Thieves
'Straight to video' film to follow shortly.
W
ith more tracks, guest artists a n d r a n d o m
animal noises than your regular hip-hop
a l b u m , A Prince Among Thieves is m u c h
m o r e than your average offering, tor a start it's b e e n
in t h e production pipeline for what s e e m s an eternity,
as release promises have b e e n continually broken.
However, n o w it's here a n d w e forgive y o u Prince Paul
for without a doubt y o u have p r o d u c e d o n e o f t h e
hip-hop a l b u m s o f the year.
After time with D e la Soul, Stetsasonic a n d a part-
time j o b with t h e Gravediggaz, Prince Paul has all the
credentials to produce the great hip-hop a l b u m that this
is. M o r e o v e r , after further listening there proves to b e
m u c h m o r e to A Prince Among Tfw'eves than w h a t first
meets the ear. Like the Goats' classic Tricks of the Shade
a n d t h e Gravediggaz' superb Niggamortiz, A Prince
Among Thieves tells a story. What's m o r e is that fol-
lowing this music release w e will later be treated with
a big screen cinematic version o f the story - straight t o
video, I'm sure.
So, what's in the story? Unsurprisingly, it's about
the rise a n d fall o f s o m e thugs in t h e gangsta w o r l d o f
drugs, g u n s a n d music in d o w n t o w n N e w York. T h e
hero of the story is Tariq played by Breeze of local under-
g r o u n d crew the Juggaknots a n d indie rap s u p e r g r o u p
the Indelible M C s . The key to it all is raising the m o n e y
to finish a d e m o tape for Wu-Tang overlord the Rza. O f
course, to raise the cash our y o u n g hustler b e c o m e s a
drug dealer a n d equips himself with a powerful firearm
a l o n g the way. Another non-surprise is that Tariq - the
alleged g o o d guy - e n d s u p b e i n g shot d e a d by o n e
time friend the evil True - played by n e w c o m e r Sha -
proving that evil always c o n q u e r s g o o d in these stories.
But what about t h e music? The beat flavours are
classic Prince Paul with Wu-Tang influences plus a little
spraying o f well-chosen beats for particular atmos-
pheric scenes. O f t h e thirty-five tracks o n the a l b u m the
highpoints c o m e with t h e disco spiced More Than You
Know w h e r e Prince Paul's old collaborators D e La Soul
are in charge o f the rhymes a n d Crazy Lou's Hideout
w h e r e long time hip-hop headcase Kool Keith rants a n d
raves as g u n dealer Crazy L o u . There's further guest
a p p e a r a n c e s f r o m such stars as H o u s e o f Pain's L-ver-
last (as a p o l i c e m a n , appropriately e n o u g h ) a n d hip-
h o p old boys Big Daddy Kane a n d Biz Markie. However,
it's t h e r a n d o m animals that s e e m to have b e e n ran-
domly scattered across the a l b u m w h o are the most wel-
c o m e guests, especially t h e elephant a n d t h e s h e e p
w h o both interrupt t h e flow f r o m time to time. W h o
k n o w s what t h e relevance o f these beasts is t h o u g h .
So after twelve years in t h e business. Prince Paul
has l a n d e d his first solo a l b u m , a n d this time t h e
m a g i c n u m b e r is five. E l

this w e e k all y o u get is a quick look at t h e
singles out a n d d u e for release in Britain. Next w e e k
should be better ...but with the w a y I write there is s o m e
doubt.
Westslde-TQ
this has b e e n getting nuff airplay a n d looks all set t o
do s o m e serious d a m a g e o n t h e charts. It's t h e first sin-
gle off his They Never Saw Me Coming Set l o n g player
and it's right o n point. Listening t o it m a k e s m e w o n -
der whether it's rap or soul, T Q (real n a m e Terrance
Quaities) has m o v e d t h e goal posts creating a single
that harks back to t h e s m o o t h west coast s o u n d but
adds a little bit more. Westside is a h o m a g e to the man's
h o m e l a n d with t h e s h o u t outs t o fallen c o m r a d e s
(Tupac, Eazy) a n d props for t h e p e o p l e h e w a s d o w n
with back in the day. His vocals are excellent a n d t h e
mid t e m p o beat is killer all a d d i n g t o a standout single
for the start o f '99.
Gimme Some More by Busta Rhymes
G i m m e s o m e m o r e , m o r e , m o r e o f this. M o n s t e r t u n e
that's just there! It's Busta time! This boy just don't stop,
after Woo Haa I t h o u g h t there's n o b e a t i n g this, but
for the s e c o n d set h e c o m e s with Put Your Hands....'
and n o w for t h e n e w set h e drops this. The b o y is m a d
and this is out o f this world....buy it!
/ Want You for Myself by Another Level
So many p e o p l e have cussed m e for giving props to
these boys, why? (I wonder....music ed). People look at
their image o f an all boy band geared for girls a n d cuss
t h e m , but y o u gotta check their tunes. This is a tight sin-
gle that works o n the vocals a n d these boys have got
voices, it brings back the o l d days o f real soul.
Destiny's Child - I'll get on
your bus anyday!
Get On The Bus by Destlnys Child feat. Timbaland
First taste c a m e last year o n p r o m o t i o n a l copy a n d h a d
us all licking our lips, waiting for the release, a n d n o w
it's here. Timbaland blows everyone away with his fan-
tastic production a n d t h e four girls sing
their hearts out. This is already massive
a n d t h e British release should, if there's
any justice, s e n d it t h r o u g h t h e roof.
When You Believe by Marlah & Whitney
The d r e a m team? W h e n n e w s first broke, that they were
g o i n g to d o a track together, back in t h e s u m m e r I w a s
h y p i n g it to t h e max. N o w it's out a n d to tell t h e truth
it's a bit o f a d i s a p p o i n t m e n t , at least I think so. The
vocals are solid, I m e a n these are t w o o f t h e best
voices in t h e business so y o u w o u l d n ' t expect t h e m to
I b e shit. T h e rest o f the record is not really worth t h e
I effort, it just doesn't d o i t . M a y b e it's because it's these
• t w o that I expect so m u c h m o r e , try again girls!
I Touch It by Monifah
Up-tempo little n u m b e r that h a s M o n i f a h trying to
c o m e out like the original freak A d i n a Howard a n d miss- -
ing. S o m e solid, if dodgy, production a n d the vocals are
g o o d but t h e record hasn't quite g o t t h e finishing
touch. It's t h e o p e n i n g single f r o m her n e w a l b u m to .
follow a n d I'm h o p i n g there's s o m e t h i n g better o n the
a l b u m or else it ain't g o n n a sell.
More Than You Know by Prince Paul feat. De La Soul
The first single release f r o m Prince Paul's phat n e w
a l b u m A Prince Among Thieves is his collaboration
with old pals De La Soul. It's a real c h a n g e from the hard
flavour that hip-hop is e x p e r i e n c i n g , a n d t h e disco
beat that t h e tune rolls a l o n g to is outstanding. Check
it.
