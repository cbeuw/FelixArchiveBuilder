Right Angles To Reality
I n the days of m y youth I w a s told what
I it means to be a man. N o w I've reached
I that a g e I've tried to d o all those things
the best I can. But it's not all been plain sail-
ing - o h n o . G o o d times, b a d times, y o u
know, I've had m y share. Just recently m y
girlfriend (and it may surprise s o m e of you
to know that I have, or rather had, one), m y
w o m a n left h o m e for another man w h o s e
only outstanding feature, to m y mind, w a s
his striking b r o w n eyes. I w o u l d have
thought that being trampled underfoot
would have shook me, but well I still don't
seem to care. All I k n o w is that I fell in love
with a girl as sweet as could be, but that it
only took a couple o f days 'til s h e w a s rid
of me. W e s e e m e d so right for each other
- she swore that she would b e all mine a n d
love m e to the e n d and I really believed
that she was the o n e - but sometimes all
of our thoughts are misgiven. O o h it makes
m e wonder. It really makes m e wonder.
We used to have a w h o l e lotta love but
after a while I couldn't get through to her.
We suffered a communication breakdown
and it was terrible - she turned out to b e a
real heartbreaker. She was unfaithful to m e
on a regular basis, even in m y o w n flat - she
was messing around with every g u y in
town, dragging m e d o w n by bringing them
on h o m e , just w h e n I had b e g u n to w o n -
der "how many more times?" she dropped
the bombshell: "Babe, I'm g o n n a leave
you," but apparently only w h e n "the s u m -
mer comes a-rolling" - it w a s March at t h e
time. In reality however, I k n e w that o n e
of those days, a n d it wouldn't b e long, I'd
look for her and baby she'd b e gone. I w a s
right. She didn't even have the courtesy to
tell m e to m y face - she just left m e a brief
note. Apparently she'd shacked up with an
American. Last thing I heard they were
going to California.
Well it didn't take t o o long before I
found out what people mean by d o w n and
out. I began g o i n g out o n t h e tiles in the
evening, drinking heavily. M o r e than once
I w o k e up in a strange place, d a z e d a n d
confused. But I can't really complain - it's
nobody's fault but mine. I might have
gone o n like this indefinitely, but for a
chance meeting that w o u l d turn my world
upside d o w n . Walking in the park just the
other day, what d o y o u think I saw? I s a w
people sitting o n the g r o u n d with flowers
in their hair a n d they asked m e to stay for
tea and have s o m e fun. Time passed a n d
I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and
I was really out of m y mind. I must have
been, because otherwise I w o u l d never
have had the courage to speak to this gor-
geous blonde w h o w a s o n e o f the group.
Her name w a s Truda M o u n t a i n a n d s h e
said she was from Norway: "From the land
of the ice and snow, from the midnight sun
where the hot springs blow," to use her
own words. Straight off the bat she told m e
that she w a s unmarried but that s h e w a s
o p e n to offers. For m y part
I w a s besotted, although I
think s o m e of what I w a s saying w a s lost
o n her -1 w a s excited a n d nervous, a n d in
such circumstances I have a tendency to
ramble on. It got later and later, a n d even-
tually with the leaves falling all around it
was time I w a s o n my way. I thanked them
and told them that I was m u c h obliged for
such a pleasant stay, but that n o w it w a s
time for m e to g o . I took m y leave of
Truda with regret, but not before w e had
arranged a date. I suggested g o i n g to the
c i n e m a or the theatre: "Let m e take you to
the movies,- can I take you to a show?" I
said. But she smiled and said that a quiet
drink w o u l d b e better. I got the tube back
to m y place still walking o n air - clearly this
was a time for rejoicing, a celebration day
in fact. Unfortunately the m o o d was some-
what spoiled by my being stopped by a
plain-clothes ticket inspector w h o fined
m e £10 for having a Travelcard for only
Zones 2-6 excluding Zone 1. I protested,
saying that I didn't realise that it was quite
so vital to have a Zone 1 ticket w h e n trav-
elling to Putney, but the he fined m e any-
way, saying that it would teach m e a lesson
and that "the time will c o m e w h e n you will
learn that O n e is all, a n d all is One." Nasty
man.
I had agreed to meet Truda the very
next day in a bar near to her flat. It turned
out that she lived a small apartment at the
end of the southbound Northern Line with
only a black d o g for company. Thus, it was
in t h e darkest depths o f M o r d e n that I
met a girl so fair. I reached the appointed
spot - a sorry-looking bar-cum-hotel called
The Royal Orleans - with time to spare.
Strangely, the entrance was locked and the
only possible point o f entry w a s a fire exit
marked "Egress Only". But with little choice
in the matter I threw caution to
the w i n d a n d went in through
the out door to find myself in
a tatty but ornate entrance hall,
decorated in the Indian fash-
ion. It looked like a run-down
version of one of those houses
of the holy m e n that y o u occa-
sionally s e e in travel d o c u -
mentaries - a place that had
seen a g o o d deal of wearing
and tearing but that still had a
certain presence. Eschewing
the delights o f the lobby I went
in to the bar which was brighter
a n d cleaner. O n o n e wall
s o m e o n e had painted a scene
of the ocean. Truda had not yet
arrived a n d so I took m y place
at a corner table a n d asked to
see the m e n u . I ordered tea for
o n e a n d a custard pie, all the
time looking around m e and,
o n account o f the giant mural,
feeling strangely like I w a s

I waited I decided to try the
1950s-style juke box that stood in another
corner of the room. Unfortunately, it w a s
broken and only played o n e record so that
no matter h o w many buttons you pressed,
the s o n g remains the same. Still, the o n e
functioning track was an Elvis number a n d
as it'd b e e n a long time since I'd rock a n d
rolled I sat back to enjoy what the King had
to offer.
Eventually Truda arrived, looking love-
lier than ever, but walking, I noticed for the
first time, with a pronounced limp. It w a s
clear that she had difficulty supporting any
weight o n her left leg. W h e n she had sat
d o w n , I asked about her ailment. She
smiled, saying that it was a old injury she
had suffered during a climbing accident in
the fjords of her h o m e l a n d a n d whilst her
dancing days were clearly over she w a s
m u c h better n o w . At the time, she had
been so badly injured that she could only
get about with the aid of four sticks. But I
was so bewitched by this living loving maid
that even her idiosyncratic gait -1 called it
the Miss T. Mountain hop - only added to
her allure, a n d the more w e talked, the
more I was smitten. So you can imagine my
dismay then w h e n she coolly a n n o u n c e d
that s h e w a s s o o n leaving L o n d o n for
g o o d for more exotic climes. "Jamaica?" I
asked. She shook her head. She w a s part
of a U N H C R team working o n flood relief
on the upper reaches o f the Indus. Appar-
ently things there were O K at the m o m e n t
but w h e n the levee breaks, it was going to
get dicey - hence the need for her rapid
deparaturc. She w a s taking a night flight
with a little-known Welsh charter c o m p a n y
called Bron-Yr-Air, the following Friday. She
had chosen that particular ailine, she said,
because of the flexibility of the ticket which
allowed y o u to alter your preferred route
and time of departure right up until the last
minute. "Yes", she said, fixing m e with her
piercing gaze "there are two paths you can
g o by but in the long run, there's still time
to change the road you're o n " . But I was-
n't listening. Faced with prospect of never
seeing Truda again I w a s seized with a sud-
d e n desire to accompany her to Kashmir.
"Let m e c o m e with you," I begged, "I'm
g o n n a crawl if necessary." To m y great joy
she agreed.
I got a job at an all-night store and was
s o o n working from seven to eleven every
night. It really m a d e m y life a drag, which
I didn't think w a s right, but finally I had
e n o u g h for t h e air fare. But fate inter-
v e n e d . O n the appointed day, as I was
packing m y bags, the p h o n e rang. It was
Truda, at the airport. There had been a
change of plan, she said, which meant that
she w o u l d have to g o to Pakistan alone.
"I'm sorry," she s o b b e d . 'Thank you, for
everything." I w a s devastated and through
a veil of tears I poured out m y heart to her,
b e g g i n g her to stay, promising her all my
love. I w a s b e c o m i n g somewhat incoher-
ent at this point a n d I had to apologise to
her for not making much sense, saying that
"since I've b e e n loving y o u I'm about to
lose m y mind." But it was too late - the pips
had g o n e a n d so had she. Happiness had
b e e n within m y grasp, but yet it had never
b e e n truly mine - it w a s a case of what is
and what should never be.
I w a s inconsolable for days but I'll
b o u n c e back. Every morning I look in the
mirror a n d tell myself "your time is g o n n a
come." That's o n e thing that the episode
with Truda taught me: in this world, you've
got to b e strong a n d stand your ground.
You've got to learn to b e a rock and not to
roll.
