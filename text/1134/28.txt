aged to get any goals. Everyone played
really well t h o u g h a n d w e w e r e quite
unlucky to lose.

Disco Squad 4 - 1 St Bart's II
W e arrived at t h e v e n u e in high spirits,
fully expecting a tassle of joy against the
fiesty Bart's 2nd XI. After pushey, w e dis-
played our skills to the cocky opposition
for a full t w o minutes before they even
t o u c h e d the ball. However, w e thought
w e w e r e onto a loser w h e n Bart's flicked
themselves a h e a d . 1-0. W e gritted our
teeth, p u t o u r sticks to t h e fore a n d
thrust ourselves u p o n t h e m . Fabababio
w a s t h e first to find t h e chink in their
armoured underpants, scoring a blinding
set piece. Before half-time Bart's w e r e
gasping for breath w h e n w e penetrated
a s e c o n d time, T h e S c u m d a n t Skid
putting t h e final thrust in to p u t t h e
score to 2-1.

his plums of fire, s l a m m e d the ball h o m e

RSM FOOTBALL
RSM I 0 -2 Goldsmith's
After six w e e k s apart, t h e R S M m a c h i n e
reassembled last Saturday for a league
fixture with follow sturgglers Goldsmith's.
R S M b e g a n w h a t is n o w a n
e x t e n d e d h o m e w a r d l e g o f the season
with what m a y prove to b e t h e first o f
m a n y six-point g a m e s , as t h e miner's
attempt to d i g their w a y o u t o f a rele-
gation hole.
C o m m u n i c a t i o n a n d language prob-
lems left the a s s e m b l e d t e a m without a
keeper, but skipper M a s e f i e l d pulled a n
ace f r o m his sieve, Lanre Smith step-
ping in to fill absent Nick Perrier's boots.
As the whistle blew it w a s o b v i o u s
that this w a s to b e an e v e n struggle with
neither side taking control. Both sides
enjoyed g o o d spells o n what w a s a heav-
ily s o d d e n Harlington pitch , still recov-
ering from the previous w e e k ' s rain.
Despite conditions the football w a s
flowing, with both sides playing intelli-
gently. Chances w e r e b e i n g created at
both ends, t h e lion's share o f qhicxh
w e r e falling to the h o m e side w h o s o m e -
h o w m a n a g e d to spurn four or five g o o d
c h a n c e s i n c l u d i n g a back post volley
from Williams after a cross from the right
beat the Goldsmith's back line.
The second half began as if the inter-
val h a d never h a p p e n e d . T h e football
was again penetrating although as time
w e n t o n m o r e a n d m o r e of it w a s b e i n g
played in t h e centre o f the pitch. This
was w h e r e "Captian-for-the-day" Milner
s h o n e , a n o m n i p r e s e n t force, relent-
lessly w i n n i n g possession a n d then dis-
patching t h e w i n g e r s as R S M believed
that s o o n o n e c h a n c e w o u l d b e con-
verted.
Yet it w a s after o n e such attack that
G o l d s m i t h ' s b r o k e quickly a n d with
plenty o f support. T h e R S M d e f e n c e
was split as an excellent piece of play pre-
s e n t e d a G o l d s m i t h f o r w a r d with a n
excellent c h a n c e , t o o g o o d to miss. H e
didn't.
15 m i n u t e s left, 3 points w e r e still
available such h a d b e e n t h e quality of
RSM's play althoughas the sand's o f time
elapsed s o d i d t h e belief. M e n w e r e
t h r o w n forward in a last ditch attempt.
With 5 m i n u t e s to g o Goldsmith's
k e e p e r a n d captain p r o d u c e d a save
that w a s w o r t h t h r e e points in a n y
league. A sharp cross from Milner w a s
met f r o m about 5 yards o u t by D o u g
Spike's h e a d . T h e ball z i p p e d from his
head towards the top left corner, until a n
o u t s t a n d i n g reaction save kept the ball
out, a n d s e e m i n g l y c r u s h e d t h e R S M
spirit.
With m e n f o r w a r d t h e inevitable
h a p p e n e d a n d Goldsmith's d o u b l e t h e
lead a n d w o n t h e match with a fairly
scrappy goal.
Not the result required by R S M mas-
sive b u t t h e quality o f football should
m a k e premiership survival a certainty.
