Here I sit broken-hearted, paid a penny and
only written the first sentence of this week's'
Mines' report.
Last Friday night, we had the Aussie
Barnight - remember it? Well done, all those
who turned up in shorts, corks and sandals,
we are believed to have demolished 70 cases
of Swan.
The following day a dozen bleary-eyed and
sore-headed Minespersons crawled into
Mines at 8:30am, donned overalls, helmets,
lamps and six-packs and. set out for the Lord
Mayor's procession. Having found the float
and IC Jazz band we duly processed through
the city and took over the bar of the London
Metal Exchange float and then processed all
the way back again. We were congratulated
by quite a few people on the liveliness and
originality of our float - special thanks must
go to Andy Lewis and Pete Gilligan for all
their work up to and on the day.
On Monday, a group of blasphemers went
to Piccadilly Circus to see 'Life of Brian' and
thoroughly enjoyed themselves. If you
couldn't get a ticket - sorry but try earlier next
time.
Highlights of the well-attended UGM on
Tuesday were the unusual slides of the great
and good Wyn Jerkins, the semi-abortive hit
on T Rev and the awarding of the 'Git' tie to
Paddy Hoskin.
All those who turned up for Chaps CJub's
Ragarama In the evening thoroughly enjoyed
it. The fastest times for orally peeling a
banana were Keith Baldie (Mat Sci 2) and
Pete Newman (Min 2) both with 3.0 seconds.
In the peel off Keith Baldie won and duly
acquired the prize of a bottle of sherry. Final
event of the evening was the obstacle race
which was won by Barney McCabe (Physics
2) who proceeded to down the contents of his
prize - a glass yard.
And so to Wednesday and MORPHY DAY.
A thousand thanks to all those who rowed
and fought their guts out for Mines. Special
congratulations must go to Morphy 8. We
won the oar (of course) after a tough battle -
well done everyone! The most surprising
thing of the afternoon was the fact that nearly
everyone got into Harrods!
