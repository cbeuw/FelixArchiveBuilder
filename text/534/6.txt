and s t o p p e d e s p i o n a g e a g a i n s t the
revolution the way would be open for
negotiations in some cases.

BBC DENIAL
The B B C has issued a report denying that a
documentary team stage-managed the
taking over of a village in Northern Ireland by
an IRA squad as a stunt for the Panorama
program. The gunmen sealed off the village in
country Tyrone for more than two hours
during which they paraded the streets
displaying an assortment of weapons.

Northern Ireland which state that B B C ' s
Northern Ireland directorate should be
consulted before a crew films terrorists.

print unions in an attempt to settle the
dispute.
VATICAN FEELING THE PINCH
The Vatican is feeling the effects of
inflation to such an extent that Vatican
bureaucracy will have to be pruned and more
money collected in the churches of wealthy
countries. After Pope John Paul made it clear
that he could accept no slackening in the
contraception rulings one Vatican priest said
that making changes to these laws would
"solve most of his financial problems
overnight. Contributions from Catholics in
the US would quintuple in gratitude. But don't
tell anyone I said so."

sided settlement with Bishop Muzorewa.

FOURTH CHANNEL
The Independant Broadcasting Authority
is proposing to set up a new company to run
the fourth TV channel which they hope will be
on the air by Autumn 1982. The new company
would not make programmes or own studios
itself but commission them from the other TV
companies and outside producers. The Â£60-
80million a year needed to run the new
channel would come partly from each ITV
company in the form of a subscription and
partly in subsidisation from the main ITV
network.
C A R T E R STOPS IRANIAN OIL IMPORTS
President Carter, to make it clear that
economic factors would have no influence in
the US dealings with Iran over the embassy
seige, ordered an end to all American oil

700,000 barrels a day from Iran which
represents 4% of the total US consumption.

MISSILES

will visit Bonn next week in a vital move in the
intense Soviet diplomatic activity against
Nato's installation of new medium range
missiles in Western Europe.
US HOSTAGES
A p p a r e n t l y due to the m o u n t i n g
international pressure members of the
Iranian Revolutionary Council opened the
way to negotiations. MrSadeq Ghotbzadeh, a
Coucil member, said there were three
conditions in a public announcement by the
US that the Shah be considered a criminal,
the formation of a tribunal to consider
charges against the Shah and the US should
accept that the wealth of the Shah should be
considered as Iranian property. The students
however rejected out of hand the possibility
that a solution did not start with the return of
the Shah.
