Dear Mr Fox
Further to our conversation
yesterday (November 12th) I wish
to inform y o u of the following'
facts concerning the disgraceful
state of the Junior Common
Room in the Sherfield Building
caused by a party held there on
November 11th.
1. That eight female cleaners had
to be employed to clean the room
after they had performed all their
normal duties in the Sherfield
Building.
2. That these cleaners were
required to remove urine stains
from the cloak room.
3. That there was broken glass on
all floors of theSherfieldBuilding.
4. That a large number of fixtures
and fittings (eg light bulbs,
furniture etc) had been destroyed.
I wish to point out that this is the
last example of a long series of
'parties' where a considerable
unpleasant mass has been left
which the cleaners have had to
clear up. Thse responsible for
c r e a t i n g the s i t u a t i o n were
obviously incapable of even
p a r t i a l l y t i d y i n g u p after
themselves.
In view of these nasty and extra
duties the cleaners consider that
t h e y s h o u l d b e s u i t a b l y
recompensed. Otherwise it is the
general feeling of the cleaners
that we can no longer continue to
perform such unpleasant tasks.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
If anyone is thinking of tabling a
motion on abortion for the next
U G M , I hope they think again.
No wonder that the frenzied
feminists and the equally fanatical
opponents of abortion managed
to empty the last U G M .
Ninety per cent of students in
this c o l l e g e a r e p h y s i c a l l y
incapable of becoming pregnant
and most of the remainder would
not know how to, including, I
suspect, Messrs Attenborough
and Clarke.
The time has come for the silent
m a j o r i t y t o t e l l b o t h t h e
supporters and opponents of
abortion to stop trying to impose
their views on the Union. If they
want to support their causes
financially then let them do it out
of their own pockets and not the
Union purse.

Dear Colin
Following the slow-moving
proceedings at last Tuesday's
U G M , s u r e l y d e b a t e s a n d
speeches could be shorter in
length. In one and a half hours,
one motion was voted on, and a
second fully debated only to be
cut short by the stupid actions of
someone yelling quorate, not
b e c a u s e t h e m e e t i n g w a s
exceptionally small or undemo-
cratic, but just for political ends to
make sure the vote did not go the
opposite way to his beliefs (not
the most democratic of actions).
Both motions moved slowly and
were debated fully, even to
excess! Speeches for and against
motions could be restricted to two
minutes, with a one minute
extension, and speeches only
from proposers and seconds for
and against the motion, with one
speech each way from the floor.
This may seem a restriction on
freedom of expression, but it
would certainly lead to a more
efficient union meeting: with
motions being debated fully, yet
concisely, and more action!
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
Thank heavens for the cuts!
ICU having failed (sorry - not
tried) to help the majority of its
memebers, the Government has
at last sprung to our aid. A 6%
reduction in student intake next
year. Just think of the implications
of this. There will be 6% fewer first
years competing for places in
Halls, houses and flats. Ifthere are
less foreign students as well then
this means even less pressure on
accommodation. Just think for
every one less overseas student,
every one less first year, then the
better (less worse) is our chance
of finding somewhere to live next
year. Callous thought isn't it? And
yet assuming still more students
came to IC just where is ICU
proposing to accommodate them
a l l ? P r o b a b l y t h e a n s w e r
c o n t e m p l a t e d i n v o l v e s a l e -
swilling orgies all night, every
night, in the Union bar, with sleep
being obtained during lectures
and food
We have heard a lot recently
about lack of support at major and
minor events such as rag and
union meetings. Setting aside the
argument that this might be due to
the sheer stupidity of these
events, has it ever occurred that a
lack of attendance might stem
from the distance required to be
travelled to these events if you are
not living 'on campus'. If more
people could be accommodated
near to IC then more people just
might turn up.
Yours faithfully

A few weeks ago, O X F A M made
a n a p p e a l t o t h e J o i n t
Chaplaincies of the Colleges in
West London to raise funds for
their Cambodian relief. This
approach was discussed at the
Chaplaincy General Meeting of
October 28th, where I subse-
quently volunteered to organize
the Imperial College end of the
Collection.
Although debate was very
unlikely, with an agenda already
holding six -motions including
those on John Shuttleworth, the
Corrie Bill, Education Cuts and
Zimbabwe (sic), I decided to
present a motion to the U G M of
November 6th to draw attention to
the current events in Cambodia
and the collection, today, for the
victims thereof.
Consequently, it was with great
interest that I read Mr Cortazzi's
very eloquent letter in last week's
FELIX. I am preparedto admit that
this motion, prepared in a hurry
and submitted two days after the
official deadline, was somewhat
ill-informed, especially in Notes
21 which is totally false, but I can
find nowhere in my motion, any
mention that Pol Pot caused this
disaster, but only that he brought
it to t h e p r e s e n t , h o r r i f i c
conclusion. Even so, I feel I must
offer some reply to this letter, as it
appears to me, far worse than ill-
informed, biased. I notice that in
his eagerness to air his anti-Soviet
prejudices, introduced with the
escape-clause 'most recently', he
fails to mention the real cause of
this 'prolonged war, instability
and violence' and I quote from a
leaflet provided by 'Third World
• First':
"For three years from 1970
Cambodia was subjected to the
most intense aerial bombardment
any country has ever experi-
enced, by the B52 bombers of the
USA. The equivalent of five
Hiroshimas in tons of bombs were
dropped."
• This and the invasion by South
Vietnamese troops forced the
Cambodian peasantry from the
fields into the cities and a previous
food surplus turned into a massive
deficit.
Unlike Mr Cortazzi, I don't wish
to extol the virtues of any side in
this debacle - in face one can only
c o n d e m n t h e e x p u l s i o n of
millions of ethnic Chinese from
Vietnam - but I can still appreciate
their problems with Chinese
troops to the North, Ships to the
East and Allies, the Khmer Rouge,
shelling over the border from
Cambodia on the West. Whether
or not one agrees with their
subsequent course of action, I
can't see how it leads to the
c o n c l u s i o n of ' N a z i - s t y l e '
expansionism and the ulimate
s u b j u g a t i o n of T h a i l a n d .
Furthermore, I wasn't aware that
there were over 1/2million ethnic
Chinese in Cambodia, let alone
that this many have drowned at
sea at the hand of Heng Samrin.
So as to stop this letter getting
too long, I can only refer anyone
still interested to articles by John
Pilger (New Statesman, Sept 21st
and Oct 12th) and the publication
'Cambodia is dying - Why?'
produced by Third World First.
Finally, if Mr Cortazzi, or
anyone else concerned at the
plight of the expelled ethnic
Chinese 'Boat People' of Vietnam
would like to help in a tangible
way, contacts me (c/o the Union)
I'll put them in touch with the
International Volunteer Service
wh are currently working with the
refugees in Kensington Barracks
and are desperately short of
volunteers. Also, anyone wanting
to help the starving people of
Cambodia, there is a collection
today at IC, the proceeds of which
will go to O X F A M .
Thank-you

Dear Colin
I would like to take this
opportunity to reply to those
fellow members of I C U who, at
last week's U G M , answered my
exercising my democratic right to
challenge the quorum of the
meeting with abuse.
Firstly, I felt that the meeting
was on the point of making a grave
mistake by passing the motion
that was before it and therby
condoning the murder of unborn
children.
Secondly, I believe that if ICU is
to pass such an abhorent motion
then it should do so with the
consent of many more of its
members than just the minimum
quorum.
I do, however, apologise to the
people wanted to get onto the
other motions on the agenda, but I
feel that the meeting would have
adjourned anyway before we had
had the opportunity to discuss
them.
So then, I would like to urge all
members of the Union to come to
the next U G M (on the 27th) and
throw out this revolting motion.
Yours
Alan Burton
