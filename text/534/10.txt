'What is R & B?'. It is in fact the name of Sid's programme on
Wednesdays. Featured are: R & B (of course), Rock and Roll, Blues,
New Wave and various other bits and pieces. If you have ever fancied
yourself as a songwriter, why not make a tape and send it to me, care of
I.C.Radio. Some people have already, and I don't mind how bad it is (I'll
probably get worse !); your anonymity is guaranteed.if you so wish
My anonymity is guaranteed, and that's the may I want it !
Sid on Wednesday, 100 minutes long, see you there.
