A
compromising
image involv-
ing the Man-
aging Director
of Imperial College
Union has emerged,
Felix reports.
The photograph shows
Jarlath O'Hara, the Man-
aging Director of Imperial
College Union, standing
beside a man at what
appears to be a party. The
man can be seen posing
while dressed in black-
face.
The photograph, which
is from over 12 years ago,
was publically viewable
as a 'featured image' on
Jarlath's Facebook page
and was discovered by
an Imperial College un-
dergraduate student at the
end of July. Jarlath was
made aware of the image's
discovery at the end of
August and immediately
took action to remove
the photograph from his
Facebook profile, as well
as later issuing the follow-
ing apology: "I entirely
condemn the act of 'black-
ing up' and at no stage
have I ever condoned this
or other discriminatory
behaviours. I am deeply
sorry for any offense
or concern that this has
caused".
In his position as Man-
aging Director of Imperial
College Union, Jarlath
is effectively the highest
ranking member of staff
in the Union. At the time
when the picture was
taken, Jarlath was working
as a Sabbatical Officer
at the London School of
Economics (LSE). He
held the position of Sport
and Recreation Manager
at LSE and, following the
event in question at which
the compromising image
was taken, he proposed
measures to ensure that
subsequent events remain
acceptable at all times.
This was through ensuring
that it was a requirement
for all event themes and
fancy dress ideas to be run
through LSE's Student
Union prior to each event.
action at the time of the
event, twelve years ago,
to prevent this type of
behaviour happening
again. Since joining
Imperial College Union
two and a half years ago
he has brought tackling
discrimination and social
injustice to the forefront
of the Unions priorities
for the first time."
A meeting was held
on Friday 5th
October
between Jarlath, Rob and
concerned students who
had seen the image; six of
whom are BME students.
Jarlath began the meeting
by extending his apologies
to those present and reit-
erating his condemnation
of 'blacking up', whilst
maintaining that he didn't
know the picture existed
and describing himself as
"very embarrassed, very
concerned, a bit confused
and annoyed" following
the picture's existence
being brought to his atten-
tion. He also stated that he
"recognises that the photo
being visible is a second-
ary aspect and the fact that
the photograph was taken
is the primary issue here".
During the meeting, the
students present repeated-
ly urged Jarlath to extend
the apology made to
thos present to the wider
student body through the
release of a public state-
ment/ acknowledgement.
Jarlth declined to do so.
In a statement on behalf
of the Board of Trustees,
Jill Finney said: "The
Board considers any kind
of discrimination utterly
abhorrent.
It is deeply unfortunate
that Jarlath found himself
photographed in these
circumstances over 12
years ago. Compromising
historical images are
increasingly a feature of
our daily lives and it is
incumbent upon all of
us to ensure we do not
participate or fall victim
to them.
The Board does not tol-
erate racism of any kind
and have satisfied them-
selves that Jarlath has no
racist intent whatsoever."
The act of dressing in
blackface (or 'blacking
up') was a form of the-
atrical make up used by
non-black performers to
caricature a black person.
The practice gained pop-
ularity during the 19th
century and contributed to
the spread of racial stere-
otypes until it ended in
the United States with the
Civil Rights Movement of
the 1960s.
