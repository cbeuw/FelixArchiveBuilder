I
magine, if you will,
Sicily of the early
twentieth century;
an island whose
main source of income is
agriculture, its residents
mainly peasants. Against
this backdrop, we are in-
troduced to the five Sacco
brothers, who are part of
an honest, hard-working,
recently landed family.
Their father, Luigi, has
made his money by
mastering the grafting
of Pistachio trees. One
day, they receive a letter
from the Sicilian Mafia,
demanding they pay for
their ‘protection’. Luigi
commits an unthinkable
act: he burns the letter and
refuses to surrender to the
demand. That is when all
of the family’s troubles
begin.
The Sicilian Mafia,
active for some time in
their town, has permeated
through the very fabric
of society, redefining
its culture and accepted
norms. When anyone
receives such a letter they
usually capitulate. Rarely
do the Mafia run into
obstinate fools, and when
they do, another letter and
a warning are sent – such
as the burning of fields
or, if that does not yield
a satisfactory result, the
death of a close family
member. But the Sacco
family does not succumb
to the pressure, instead
resorting to the law at
every incident. The police
are helpless, even shocked
that the family would
not simply give in to the
demands of the Mafia.
They essentially offer
them no protection and
cannot prosecute any of
the suspects, despite their
confidence in the brothers’
claims, due to a conven-
ient ‘lack of evidence’.
The family is forced to
take measures to ensure
their safety, moving out of
the countryside to a nearby
town, arming themselves
to the teeth during every
visit to their fields.
However, matters soon
take a turn for the worse
with the Mafia. Viewing
the Sacco’s defiance an
intolerable offence, they
try to engineer events such
that the Sacco brothers
are convicted of crimes
they themselves commit-
ted. Soon the situation
becomes so unbearable
that some of the brothers
become fugitives.
With the political
changes occurring in Italy,
the brothers hope that the
new Fascist government
of Mussolini would
wage a war against the
Mafia. An unlikely event,
since some of the Mafia
members were big donors
to the party, that comes to
pass because of a fallout
between the two. It is
soon clear, however, that
the new Prefect will stop
at nothing to apprehend
the Mafia, even those who
actively fought against it
like the Sacco brothers.
Their safety is compro-
mised further and there is
no recourse for them but
to hand themselves in.
The narrative takes on,
at times, a biographical
nature, using excerpts
of one of the brothers’
writings to expound on
the events, which are
based on a true story. The
first half of the novel was
a thrilling page-turner; I
was so engrossed in the
Saccos’ struggle and their
uncertain future. The latter
half though was not nearly
as intriguing; it mainly
dealt with the arrest, trial
and imprisonment of three
of the brothers.
The setting of the novel
was what first drew me
to it, and, in that respect,
it did not disappoint. The
lifestyle, culture, and
sudden political upheav-
als serve as anchors that
do not totally overshadow
the story itself. It was an
interesting insight into
Sicily of the 1920s and the
culture of the Mafia, which
was not extinguished by
the imprisonment of most
of their members during
the Fascist era. Camilleri
uses a quote from A
History of Sicily to explain
this: “Had the Mafia been
an association instead of a
way of life, [the Prefect]
might have been able to
suppress it for a while,
but its complex social
and economic causes
could never be removed
in such a short amount of
time, and using only such
methods.”
Camilleri’s writing
leaves much to be desired.
His attempt at transform-
ing the true historical
events into a story failed,
in my opinion. Instead,
it took the tone of a ref-
erence text almost, espe-
cially towards the middle
and the end. I believe
that, were Camilleri not
a big name thanks to his
Inspector Montalbano
series (which I haven’t yet
read), this novel would
not have been translated
into English. Suffice it to
say that, by the end of the
book, I was less than en-
thusiastic at the prospect
of a foray into his most
famous works.
