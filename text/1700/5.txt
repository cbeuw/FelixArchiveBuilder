from the Republicans

A
fter the election
of 1800, who
would become
the third
President of the American
Republic was very much a
mystery.With the electoral
college tied at 73 between
Thomas Jefferson and
Aaron Burr, the decision
was left to the House
of Representatives with
Jefferson only winning
the Presidency after the
36th
ballot. While the na-
tional media was obsessed
with the voting in the
House of Representatives,
the jurisprudence of all
succeeding constitutional
republics was set. During
the nearly five-month
lame-duck period (yes
that was how long it was
prior to the passing of
the 20th
amendment),
John Adams nominated
and got the Senate to
confirm John Marshall as
the Chief Justice of the
United States. Thus, de-
spite the Federalists never
winning a presidential
election again, through
his historic judgment in
Marbury vs Maddison,
Justice Marshall set forth
the precedence of judicial
review and ensured that
the Federalist viewpoint
remained at the centre of
American Government for
the next 35 years. To those
that think the American
judiciary suffered be-
cause of the fierce battle
over Brett Kavanaugh’s
nomination, they are
unfortunately historically
ignorant. The Supreme
Court has always been a
political battle front, and
it’s high time that the
Democrats learned how
to successfully wage this
war.
Since 1968, the Dem-
ocrats have only been
able to nominate and
successfully confirm four
justices. During this same
period, Republicans have
successfully nominated
15 Justices. Democrats
have been losing this
battle for the last 50 years,
with Republicans not even
pretending to act with any
decorum or respect for
the rules and traditions
of the senate. The shear
audacity of the Republi-
can majority in refusing to
even give Barack Obama’s
nominee Merrick Garland
a hearing let alone a vote
on the senate floor, must
be recognised for what it
is – theft.
Ever since the retire-
ment of Earl Warren, the
Supreme Court has been
deeply conservative, with
the odd few exceptions, in
its judgments. This façade
that Antony Kennedy was
a legitimate swing vote
needs to be corrected.
Justice Kennedy voted
in favour of Bush in
Bush v Gore, authored
the majority opinion in
Citizens United that legal-
ised unlimited corruption
in American politics and
voted to overturn Oba-
macare. These are only
a sample of the litany of
partisan decisions Justice
Kennedy has made over
the years. With the ex-
ception of Justice Souter,
all Republican appointee
Supreme Court judges
have been far right-wing
zealots. Justice Kava-
naugh is only the latest
example.
Republicans had no
qualms in confirming a
manwhohasbeencredibly
accused of attempted rape
by three individuals. In
1991, the Senate shame-
fully belittled another
credible accuser of sexual
harassment, Professor
Anita Hill, and confirmed
Clarence Thomas. In the
27 years since, many
things have changed in
society. Gay marriage
has been legalised, there
was an African-American
President and a woman
won the popular vote in
a presidential election.
Despite these historic
social changes, when the
choice comes to either be-
lieving a credible victim
of sexual assault or ap-
pointing the said accuser
to the highest court of the
land, Republicans will
always choose the latter.
Republican justices
have also not attempted to
hide their many unethical
backgrounds and practis-
es. Justice Abe Fortas was
forced to resign from the
court (which enabled the
Conservative wing to gain
control of the court for the
first time in a generation
… and the same control
which it has retained ever
since) and faced impeach-
ment due to his continued
retainer fees of $20,000
from his former client.
In today’s day and age,
where Justice Scalia died
while living free of charge
in the estate of John Po-
indexter (one of his com-
panies was facing a trial
in the court) and Justice
Kennedy retiring while
his son does business
with the Trump family.
Justice Fortas’ resignation
because of ethical consid-
eration 50 years ago now
pales in comparison to the
swamp that is the Repub-
lican party. Even before
Dr Christine Blasey
Ford’s courageous testi-
mony, Brett Kavanaugh
had already disqualified
himself when he com-
mitted perjury by lying
about his past actions as
a political apparatchik for
George W Bush.
In the election for Pres-
ident in 2020, whoever
becomes the Democratic
nominee must pass a
simple yet groundbreak-
ing litmus test: promise to
pack the court and restore
balance. How could the
present situation continue
when in this century alone
the Democrats have com-
fortably won the popular
vote in all but one presi-
dential election, but been
allowed to confirm two
Supreme Court judges
compared to the Repub-
licans’ four. Nowhere in
the American constitution
is it written that the
Supreme Court must have
nine judges, in fact this
number has changed over
the years. The constitu-
tion sets Congress as the
arbiter for determining the
size of the Court, and over
the years Congress has
acted on it. Court packing
is a hallowed tradition
that was common practise
in the 19th
century. It was
only after Franklin D
Roosevelt’s failed attempt
to increase the size of the
court in 1937 that court
packing became a taboo.
If Democrats want to
restore balance, they must
not fear the backlash from
the corporatist media, and
follow in the lead set forth
by their greatest ever pres-
ident. In Washington, bi-
partisanship usually mean
one thing, the common
man being screwed. Wars
and increased defence
spending will always get
bipartisan support. Giving
healthcare to the poor?
Never. So Democrats must
not seek bipartisanship,
when the Republicans
have made clear they will
never reciprocate. The Re-
publicans removed the fil-
ibuster for Supreme Court
when they confirmed
Justice Gorsuch last year.
When the democrats
regain control of both
chambers of Congress and
the Presidency, they must
take the next step. Get rid
of the legislative filibuster.
Leave alone the Supreme
Court, all the progressive
goals like universal
healthcare and protecting
the environment can never
overcome a Republican
filibuster in the Senate.
Correspondingly, the
Democrats should pass
a Judicial Reform Bill
with a simple majority in
expanding the court from
nine to eleven. And then
appoint two very young
liberal judges. Only with
this nuclear option will
Republicans agree to
come to the negotiating
table and propose a bipar-
tisan amendment to the
constitution that would
enable every president to
appoint two, and no more
than two, Supreme Court
appointments or introduc-
ing term-limits for judges.
Either way the status
quo cannot be allowed to
remain.
