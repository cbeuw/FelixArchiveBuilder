mperial College
Ultimate’s Disc
Doctors recently
participated in an
international beach
tournament, BURLA,
from September 20th
to September 23rd in
Viareggio, Italy. The aim
of attending BURLA was
to allow our university
team to participate in
beach ultimate, which is
not implemented during
the university season. In
addition, the tour hoped
to develop the social and
fun part of our ultimate
community. Both of these
goals were achieved as the
team members who par-
ticipated got to play three
days of beach ultimate as
well as spend time with
team members off the
pitch at the beach venue,
Flora Beach. Whilst the
team could not muster
as many players as we
wished, there was a decent
sized team for beach of 8
full club members. Beach
ultimate is played 5-aside.
All tour money was used
to subsidize air travel or
train tickets to the venue.
A day by day break
down of the tour is listed
below:
Thursday 20th
Teammemberschecked
in together at Campsite
Paradiso in Viareggio,
Italy, completed the final
registration for BURLA,
and rented bikes to travel
to and from the campsite.
The team enjoyed dinner
together at the campsite
and briefly attended the
tournament’s Welcome
Party before retiring to the
bungalows booked.
Friday 21st
The team had breakfast
together at the campsite
before biking to the
tournament venue at
the beach. The captains
attended the captains
meeting at the beach at
around 10:00 am, after
which the team played
three matches. Between
matches, the team either
kept score of other games
they were told to score or
rested at the venue. The
team’s first game was at
10:00 am against another
university team called
Bear Foot. The next game
was held at 12:00 noon
against the team Admiral
Ackbear. Both teams
were sent by Warwick
University. Lunch and
refreshments were taken
on the beach at the Dori
bar using the lunch tickets
provided. The last game
was played against the
Trojan Unicorns (a team
who ultimately won
the entire tournament)
at 17:00 pm. After the
game the team enjoyed
SUNSET SPRITZ apertif
on the beach whilst
keeping score of a game
between Admiral Ackbear
and Trojan Unicorns.
After this the team cycled
back to the campsite to eat
dinner and recover from 3
defeats.
Saturday 22nd
The team enjoyed a
lie in as their first game
was not until 12:00 noon
against the German Grand
Masters Team. Unsur-
prisingly, it was another
defeat, but the team was
extremely happy to have
developed improving
flow throughout the game
and have slowed an ex-
perienced national team
down. This game showed
that the team was starting
to get the hang of playing
on sand. At 14:00 pm the
team played another game
against Quattro Stazioni.
After the games the team
again enjoyed lunch at
Dori bar using the lunch
tickets provided. The team
then enjoyed swimming
and practicing throwing
on the beach. At 18:00 pm
the tournament hosted a
BANZAI beer race which
the entire team partici-
pated in. The team then
enjoyed dinner together
at a nearby restaurant and
then cycled back to the
campsite to get ready for a
tournament hosted themed
party, which also included
a live music from a banwd
called euroTUNZ and a
DJ at Flora Beach. The
party was hosted from
9:30 pm to 2:30 am and
included shuttle service to
and from the campsite and
the party location. It was a
very mediocre party.
Sunday 23rd
The final day was a
brutally early start with a
game against Sharkbear
at 9:30 am. At 12:30 pm
the team ended with a
super close game against
the team Who Bear Wins,
which ended on universe
point, to the disc Doctors!
This win ensured the
team did not end up last.
The team then enjoyed
lunch and drinks at the
Dori bar with the lunch
tickets provided and then
watched the final games
and the award ceremony
before returning to the
campsite to rest and pack
up.
