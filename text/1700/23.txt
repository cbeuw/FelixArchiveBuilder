Felix’s Gaming Section wants you!

H
ello from the
Games editors,
The Games
editors not
writing about games?
Preposterous! This isn’t
the content I expect in
my Felix Newspaper!
Alright, ease the frothing
at the mouth and hear
us out, I know it’s a
strange concept but we’ve
decided that rather than
hog the gaming section
we should open our inbox
to the student public. I
know, risky decision on
our part, but we’ll make
it work … hopefully
(inb4 dumpster fire).
Deviating from future
regrets and bad decisions,
we’re here to offer you
the grand opportunity to
vent your opinions on the
latest and greatest games,
boardgames or otherwise
as well as qualms with
the gaming industry.
Do you think you have
what it takes to write for
Felix’s gaming section ?
Then read this article to
see if the shoe fits, as you
may not be cinderella but
you may be what we’re
looking for in a writer!
gaming news and events:
and on the odd ocassion
we may demand pictures
of Spider-man. Articles
can also discuss themes
and topics regarding
games rather than just
games themselves, e.g.
“The impact of Atari
games on modern day
pop culture”, “Has the
boss rush genre reached
its limit”. Material similar
to this is appreciated,
but it must come with
well reasoned points and
evidence. Also under our
remit is boardgames, so
if there’s an absolutely
fantastic recently released
boardgamethatyouwould
like to pour your heart
out over in written form,
then just send it our way.
Now what do we mean
by recent? Predominately
that is within 3 weeks or
a suitable timespan that
provides it with some
relevance (looking at
you people who want to
review Monopoly and
its friendship destroying
tendencies!)
What we are looking
for in our writers?
Other than degrees
in English literature
and creative writing
from Cambridge, we’re
looking for writers who
are passionate and are
ready to put said passion
on paper. Passion being
a loose term which
translates to “please do
not send us an article that
is decorated with your
fan fic, I don’t care how
marketable your shipping
skills are, Donald Trump
and Putin shipping is
forbidden”.
Now we’re no harsh
critics to articles and
neither are we requesting
you send in your article
in LaTex format, however
we do expect people to
have at least read through
their article at least once
before sending it through.
This so we can enjoy
something coherent to
read and editable without
affecting the original
content.
What you get out of
this?
Just like us, you don’t
get paid, but you do have
the opportunity to have
your name featured as a
writer for Felix and also
chill with us sometime as
we layout and set up your
article.
How do you get in
touch?
You can contact us
through our email -
games.felix@imperial.
ac.uk . Be warned we can
only put so many articles
in one Felix issue, so if
it doesn’t turn up in the
upcoming issue it may
turn up in the next.
Wanting your voice to be heard on all things game related? Up to date on gaming news? Want to write for Felix?
Then read this article and see if you are up for the task!

“Do you think

What we are looking
for in our articles?
Now as good as you
may be at writing articles,
we’re looking for material
that is up to date and
covers recent games,
“We’re looking
for passionate
writers who
are ready
to put said
passion on
paper ”
