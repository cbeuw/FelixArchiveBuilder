I
am still angry. After
over 2 years of
politics surrounding
Brexit, nothing good
at all has happened. Our
country is fractured, major
issues with domestic
policy haven’t been dealt
with, and our government
is a puppet of the far-right.
It is about time that we
come to terms with the
fact that Brexit just isn’t
worth it.
From the start of this
process, Brexit has been
framed as being a middle
finger to the establishment
because government
was not working for the
working class. However,
many of the frustrations
that regular people care
about aren’t actually
caused by EU policies.
Issues like income
inequality, housing,
education, healthcare,
immigration, transport,
poverty, homelessness,
etc. were all dependent on
the policy of the Tories’
deep austerity, i.e British
domestic policy. I believe
that people were genu-
inely fed up of 6 years of
cuts and needed an outlet,
hence why we saw such
a close result in the 2014
Scottish independence
referendum. Wealth is not
evenly spread across the
country, and as a result,
creates a sentiment where
people feel left behind
by the growth of London
and the economy. With
London alone accounting
for 24.8% of the UK’s
GDP (as of 2015) the
and the OECD saying
that “The highest levels
of income inequality in
Europe are reached in the
United Kingdom and the
Baltic States.”, we need
to open the discussion
surrounding income ine-
quality in and implement
policies to combat this,
rather than blaming the
EU for all our issues.
This severe inequality in
the UK, I believe, set the
pretext as to why people
were willing to test the
boundaries of British
politics and see if such a
radical idea like Brexit
could come into fruition,
all in an effort to make
their voices heard.
However, what makes
me genuinely upset is
aimlessness in which
this electoral potential
was aimed at. Instead of
a grassroots movement
where we could hold
crony capitalists account-
able and demand reform
that works for all people,
via party and general elec-
tions, the public anger was
capitalised by the far-right
of this country for their
own extreme political
agenda, then manipulated
by the Tories (the source
of deep austerity over the
previous 6 years) for po-
litical points. “Blame the
EU” we were told. Many
were convinced that the
EU was the source of all
our domestic struggles
and that being British
and European weren’t
compatible, all in an effort
to “take back control” and
return the ‘glory days’ of
the empire. This is polit-
ical talk for supremacy
like the times of British
colonialism where Britain
used the tactic of divide
and rule to assert its
Anglo-Saxon dominance
on the world and perpet-
uate a narrative of ‘us
against them’. The thing
is, history is cyclical. We
have heard these racist
assertions 50 years ago
with the migrants of
Uganda, India, Pakistan,
and the Caribbean.
Has our country been
invaded? Has our country
lost its British identity?
Has our country become
a wasteland? I don’t think
gration, but as a British
person of colour from an
immigrant family, I can’t
help but see the blatant un-
derlying racism and desire
for British supremacy. It’s
the 21st century and the
political currency is di-
plomacy and soft power,
not annexation of land
the oppression of people.
Our government seems
to have lost any form of
reasonable diplomatic
skill and is, instead, on a
delusional pursuit towards
British “independence”
and an assertion on
global trade – almost like
colonial times. Those
who believe that Britain
will realistically remain a
top 5 economy are delu-
sional. The reality is that
although the sun never
used to set on the British
empire, today the United
Kingdom is a small island
off the coast of Europe
with moderate population
of 65 million people and a
love of tea. PwC’s report
on the long view of global
economies predicts that
UK’s economy will be
overtaken by Mexico,
Russia, Indonesia and
India. That is just a matter
of fact that we have to
deal with. So, this notion
that Britain can ‘become
independent again’ and
assert its dominance just
like we used to 200 years
ago is just farcical.
From an economic
perspective, Brexit again
doesn’t really solve our
domestic issues. It is just a
ploy to loosen regulations
(which I must mention,
keep us safe!) for selfish
economic gain. Brexit in
this perspective is a com-
promise of our safety for
few more pounds.Arecent
example of how this could
impact us is seen by the

“British culture
has developed
our country
to become
a global
and cultural
exporter”
so. In fact, I argue that
British multiculturalism
has actually developed
our country to become the
global hub and cultural
exporter that it is today.
So why should we treat
today’s fearmongering of
the “immigration crisis”
any different to the past?
Why does it deserve any
validity?
2 years down the rabbit
hole of Brexit, I think it is
important to realise that
we are at a stage were
the far-right are now
moderates and extreme
political talk is normal-
ised. Whenever I hear
talk about “taking back
control”, it may be framed
as a reasonable argument
for controlling immi-

inequality,
education,

homelessness
are the results

devastating disaster of
Grenfell, Tower where
72 innocent lives where
taken because of a lack
of regulation surrounding
fire safety in cladding,
which essentially allowed
flammable cladding to be
placed on Grenfell tower.
After Brexit, imagine
what deregulation could
do to public safety, and
the safety of goods we
use. Cheaper materials
for higher profit margins,
for example, would
mean that consumer and
environmental standards
suffer as a result. Of
course, there should be
balance in regulations, as
with everything, but as
a whole, EU regulations
surrounding goods and
services have benefitted
our safety and experienc-
es at the expense of large
corporations who only
care about their sharehold-
ers and their stock market
price. Brexiteers who
claim that controlling our
own regulations would be
better for striking trade
to gain the most and can
afford to switch to private
healthcare and education.
It is for this colonialist
and economic selfishness
that I say that Brexit is a
political project for the
far-right British elite,
framed as a stand against
the establishment which
they are very much a
part of. Look at us now,
Theresa May – the
embodiment of British
elitism – is the prime
minister, and her domestic
policies are very much
similar to the Cameron
establishment that was de-
monised during the 2016
referendum. The truth
is that for real change to
happen in this country, we
need a shake-up in tradi-
tional British government
and to elect people that
genuinely care about the
betterment of the whole
of the United Kingdom
and all its different and
beautiful people.
But for now, we are
looking at a bleak, not
too distant future where a
disastrous no-deal Brexit
is likely, causing the
far-right to be bolstered,
hate crimes to increase,
and civil unrest to take
place across the country.
Brexit was sold to us on
lies, fearmongering, and
“I am in favour
of a second
referendum
to reset the
political
deadlock”
“EU
regulations
surrounding
goods and
services have
benefitted our
safety”
a predated colonialist
ideology. The vote was
won on a close majority
of 1.9% - possibly swayed
by the overspending by
the Vote Leave campaign.
London, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland are being
pulled from the EU out
of their own will. People
voted for change, but no
one voted for this.
That is why I am
in favour of a second
referendum to reset the
deadlocked politics that
we are suffering. The
EU is not perfect, there
is a reasonable argument
for Brexit. However, we
are geographically not
going anywhere and the
EU member states are
our neighbours, therefore
the best way to trade and
reform the structure of
our relationships is within
the European Union. We
need to have honest and
frank debate about Brexit
and about immigration
– because it is a real
concern for some people
and should not be wholly
dismissed as racist. But
no, a second referendum is
not “going against the will
of the people”; it is the
democratic choice make.
People can change their
minds, and democracy
should allow it, especially
now that we know what
Brexit actually means. I
am a part of a generation
that currently stands to
lose everything for choice
that I didn’t make because
of an elderly nostalgia
for the British Empire.
deals and boosting the
economy are often the
same Tories that are able
to influence policy to their
own economic advantage.
A post-Brexit Britain
would have to become
low-regulation, low-tax
country to attract invest-
ment and strike trade
deals. The notion that
not paying into EU will
save us money that can be
invested in public services
is nonsense. As a result of
Brexit, cuts in tax-funded
services, like NHS and
education, would affect
the poorest the most,
whereas the wealthiest
echelons of society stand
Two years on from the
referendum, the 18, 19
and 20 years olds of today
deserve a chance to voice
their opinion, not for sake
of partisan politics but for
the sake of democracy
itself. The Tories are cur-
rently pursuing an agenda
of electoral repression by
increasing restrictions for
voting, and redrawing and
reducing constituencies –
which disproportionally
affects young people,
ethnic minority voters,
lower income voters,
and reduces the seats of
opposition parties – all
in an effort to bolster the
conservative majority
and retain their grasp on
power. We should not
stand for this. When far-
right politics is dominat-
ing the political spectrum
and Theresa May’s
Government wants to
restrict our say in British
politics, we don’t have the
luxury to be passive about
politics.
