Union volunteers
have fallen victim to
targeted ‘catfishing’
attempts from foreign
prisoners looking for
new income streams.

Editor-in-Chief
A
n undercover
investigation
by Negafelix
has revealed
an alarming number of
ICU volunteers falling
prey to requests for cash
and companionship from
incarcerated individuals.
Negafelix has inter-
cepted a letter addressed
to the Science Fiction
Society from one Mr
Cedric Desmond, of 2750
Jailbird Boulevard, NV
81637, requesting finan-
cialsupportthroughonline
purchase of his collection
of soft-core erotica, as
well as his online writing
masterclasses.
Connected to the letter
was a link to his personal
InmatesPersonified page,
where he is self-described
as “six foot 3 inches (tall),
[with a] muscular build”
and “looking for love.”
Further detective work
- involving Google - re-
vealed that Mr Desmond
was, in fact, 5’3” with
a “large build” and
imprisoned since 2000
on an array of charges
including - but not limited
to - battery, kidnap and
aggravated assault with a
sex toy.
Emile de Boullion, part-
time Student Receptionist
at the Union Reception,
expressed dismay at the
findings.
“He told me he loved
me,” she exclaimed in
despair. “He said that his
work was an expression of
his passion for me. I feel
betrayed and used, like an
old dishrag. How could I
fall for a man not even tall
enough to catch me?”
Another student, who
wishes to remain anony-
mous, claimed, “He used
to send me love poetry. I
felt so special. Then my
friend [CheeseSoc Pres-
ident] also got the same
letters. We both found out
he’d been pulling excerpts
from his e-book of BDSM
erotica on Amazon. I was
livid.”
Binky Steel, Deputy
President, Welfare, said
of the situation, “I can’t
believe I didn’t get a
single letter. Quite frankly,
I’m offended - don’t they
desk about how they’re
oppressed by the system.
I might want some steamy
love notes too!”
Mr Desmond, speak-
ing from Nevada State
Penitentiary, defended his
choice of targets. “Look,
I’ve been locked up for
18 years and even I know
how tragic your uni is.
Y’all still read my letters
and bought my books.
I’m just trying to get me
some extra cash - if that’s
a crime, then call me a
criminal!”
The Union has stated
that it plans to survey
affected individuals, the
data from will be used to
make colourful charts for
display.

Negafelix apologises
on behalf of Felix for
once again screwing
up the Crossword
Puzzle
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
F
or the second
week in a row,
students and
staff at Imperial
College London were
rocked by the continued
failure of Felix to print
a correct Crossword
Puzzle.
Negafelix would like
to take this opportunity
to apologise on behalf
of Felix for the flawed
Crossword Puzzle and for
also being a bit of a dick
last week. On discovery of
the erroneous Crossword
Puzzle, Felix’s initial
reaction was: “bruh...”.
This time around, the
error was not as severe as
that of the infamous in-
correct Crossword Puzzle
of Felix Issue 1698, the
first issue of Felix for this
academic year (pictured).
In that issue, the Cross-
word was simply unsolv-
able, as the clues did not
correspond to the grid.
This time around, one of
the clues was ommitted.
For those of you deeply
affected by this, the clue
for 13 Down was “haste,
carelessness”.
With this being the
second consecutive week
that the Crossword has
been flawed, it is safe to
say that Felix, and the
wider Imperial College
community in general,
has entered a state of
crisis. It seems that the ire
of those that initially con-
tacted Felix to complain
was, in fact, completely
justified and Negafelix
can do nothing but offer
unreserved apologies for
the fuck up. However, it
is important to remember
that the paper is printed
weekly and there’s always
next week’s issue. We
promise not to screw up
again.

Felix just can’t sort its Crossword Puzzle Out
This week, you are the
Union Student Activities
Co-ordinator. People are
rioting about the room
booking delays, calling
for your head. You do the
wise thing and hide under
your desk.
This week, you discover
Ethos membership fees
have gone up.
You take it as a sign
to stay in bed and eat
Sensations.
This week, you fall in
love. At least you think
it’s love. Your heart’s
squeezing in longing and
you feel so lightheaded
you could fly.. Actually,
this sounds a bit like a
heart attack.*
It’s only 3 weeks in and
yet this week you’re
already in over your head.
Congrats, you have more
issues than Felix.
This week you’ve
realised it’s time to
come out to the world.
There’s no point hiding it
anymore.
You too identify as Ethics
& Environment.
This week you find
yourself in hot water.
Quite literally so;
someone tampered with
the heating in the Ethos
pool and you feel like a
steamed crab (har har).
This week you decide to
run for Representative to
Council.
Bless your heart; you
have no idea what you’ve
signed up for, do you?
This week you lose
your appeal in Union
Court and get banned
from attending lectures
for 3 days. Not that you
were planning on going
anyway.
This week, you remember
people saying that every
flat at uni has one prick
no-one likes, but your
flatmates are cool. When
you walk into the kitchen,
everyone stops talking
and looks away.*
This week, you’re
Theresa May. For some
unknown reason, you still
have a job. Seriously; no
one likes you and you’re
not even that good at
what ever it is that you
do. Yet still you cling
on.*
This week you decide
to read through your
society’s SPAM digest for
fun.
What the hell were the
previous committee
signing up for??
“For God’s
sake,
heartbreak
doesn’t count
as mitigating
circumstances”
know who I am? No one
gives two shits about
CheeseSoc or those Sci
Fi nerds, so why do they
get all the fun? All I get
is people crying at my
“I can’t believe
I didn’t get a
single letter...
don’t they
know who I
am?”
surge in the number of
students looking for
support with dejection.
“For God’s sake,” says
Beatrice Argave, “heart-
break doesn’t count as
mitigating circumstances.
We’ve had 3 students ask
for help this term; that’s
more than we had the
whole of last year! How
do people know where we
are? Take your bullshit to
counselling.”
“There’s
always next
week’s issue...”
