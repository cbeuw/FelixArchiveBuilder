From dear Reader to dear Leader
In response to Grumpy Bastard’s article last week, Felix’s resident leftist, Grumpy Gramsci,
gives his perspective on politics at Imperial.
COMMENT
Grumpy Gramsci
Comment Writer
Salutations, fellow
travellers! Bad news
for regular followers
of Grumpy Bastard’s
column: they’ve had
to take the week off to
recover from a ruptured
spleen, suffered suppos-
edly due to the cumulative
traumas of Freshers’
Week, the uncommonly
pleasant weather, and
the first advent calendars
going on sale. That’s how
they were found, so I hear
– slumped over the desk,
having just penned the
final word of their latest
column, with their usual
“creative associates”
(John Smith and Jack
Daniels) arranged around
them solemnly like
some bizarre Neolithic
monument to Middle
England. But fear not, for
I have been tasked with
providing the allotted 600
words of bile this week;
yes, the powers that be
in Felix, in their infinite
cowardice, have decided
that “balance” is needed
in the form of a Grumpy
Gramsci to replace
Grumpy Bastard [Ed.: I
didn’t get the Gramsci bit
either].
Of course, avid readers
of Felix will be aware that
Grumpy Bastard is the
balance, a lone voice of
“sanity” (loosely defined)
in a rag otherwise cor-
rupted by us, the Hard
Left. Like all good hacks,
I know which way the
wind is blowing, and I
know who’s signing my
paychecks. These days,
everyone in Felix is an
Edgy Marxist, and I’m
certainly not one to miss
a good bandwagon – I’ll
tote my tote and spoil my
vote with the best of them.
The mistake that ol’
GB makes, though, is in
thinking that this state of
affairs extends beyond
the confines of the Felix
office. In a shocking rev-
elation, I can reveal that
Imperial College is hardly
a hotbed of radicalism,
despite what previous
columns would have
you think. In truth, the
Felix office is an oasis of
Ideological CorrectnessTM
in an otherwise apathetic
desert. The response that
typically greets those
leftists among us when we
mention politics is really
much the same as the
one received by righties:
stony-faced silence. You
would expect that this
would be familiar even
to loyal readers of Felix,
many of whom will have
had to endure mind-numb-
ing political conversations
with the American stoner
guy or that smug ginger
prick at Meet the Writers
events.
I’ll concede that what
few leftists there are tend
to be a bit more visible on
campus these days. You
can sometimes find all
five of us outside the main
entrance or the library,
clutching our chosen
instruments of hate – the
megaphone, the leaflet,
even (dare I say it?) the
box of chalk. Truly these
are the end times, when a
student can’t even venture
from the library to the JCR
for fear of being engaged
in dreaded human inter-
action. It’s this flouting
of convention – and
there can be none more
grave than daring to talk
to someone on London’s
streets – that makes
us leftists so goddamn
dangerous. Just take a
look at us, with our hair,
and our piercings, and
our second-hand books;
we represent nothing less
than the decay of our
once-great nation’s moral
fibre. Maybe we ought to
just grow up, wear some
normal glasses and buy
a fucking Kindle like
everyone else.
Or maybe not. I don’t
know about you, dear
reader, but I don’t miss
the days of old, where
women weren’t allowed
in the Union Bar. Bleed-
ing-heart liberal Stewart
Lee once described polit-
ical correctness as a kind
of institutionalised polite-
ness, and I think that fits
– it ought to be a courtesy,
a sign of our respect
for others, to consider
“Despite
their original
payment of
£40, students
now must pay
a subscription
of £30 yearly”
carefully the words we
choose and the tone we
use. After all, it’s hardly
an assault on campus
freedom to be upbraided
for joining some all-male
Bullingdon-rejects club.
It seems, then, that I’m
signing off on a disap-
pointingly earnest note.
Perhaps I’ve just spent
too much time down in
the West Basement echo
chamber, but I for one
would welcome a bit
more action on campus.
The green shoots of
progress are there; for the
first time in a long time,
political discourse at
Imperial seems to extend
beyond “uhh…maybe let
machines run things?”.
So raise a glass in toast,
comrades, and hoist the
flag on high: long live
the People’s Republic of
South Kensington!
Henry Hart accuses Sport Imperial of fraud
In light of the recent contract changes to the terms of use of Ethos, comment writer Henry
Hart accuses Sport Imperial of acting fraudulently
Fraud: Wrongful
OR criminal deception
intended to result in
financial or personal gain.
At least that’s the defini-
tion google gives me. It
perfectly describes the sit-
uation that Sport Imperial

has created with its new
scheme to increase Ethos
fees to £30 a year. Yes, I
could hardly help but hear
you screaming through the
page that this is an incred-
ibly good deal for students
- I agree. However, it was
not the deal I made when
I handed over my £40
for use of Ethos for the
entirety of my degree.
Charge freshers this new
reasonable fee but Sport
Imperial are not entitled to
void their contract with all
previous gym users. That
is fraud.
I was so astounded at
this recent revelation, such
that I could not believe
that Sport Imperial would
commit fraud, that I went
to the Sport Imperial
stand at Freshers’ fair and
asked the representative
to clarify the situation. To
my shock he confirmed
that even people who
had paid the £40 would
be required to pay £30
a year for gym access.
He then qualified this by
saying that Sport Imperial
had consulted with the
relevant student bodies,
whatever that means, and
that the gym facilities
had been improved. Well
that’s all very well and
good, but that DOES
NOT give you the right
to void your contract with
me or any other student
who was conveniently left
out of this ‘consultation’.
And it was a contract.
Aside from the legality
surrounding the ‘verbal
contracts’, a true English-
man’s word is his bond,
and for Sport Imperial to
cast that principle aside
shames this organisation
and this University. I am
disgusted that the union is
condoning fraud.
