Balls Up

S
outh American
countries have
usually been
ignored by the
Western media, with few
exceptions. On the few
occasions the continent
was reported by our
news organisations, its
nations were painted as
permanently failed states
ravaged by civil war, dic-
tators and death squads.
This picture ignores the
deep changes that the
region has experienced
since the late 80s, when
the regimes that dominat-
ed the region started to
crumble, a combination
of indigenous democratic
revolts against the des-
potic rulers and the loss
of support for said rulers
of successive American
administrations, that had
propped up criminals
like Pinochet or Ríos
Montt to curb the Soviet
influence in the region
(as one President of the
USA put it: “They may be
bastards, but they’re our
bastards.”).
Brazil is a textbook
example of this phenom-
enon. After the military
dictatorship was toppled
in 1985, the leftist govern-
ment of Luiz Inácio Lula
da Silva’s Workers’ Party
instituted policies like the
Bolsa Família, that gave fi-
nancial benefits to poorest
elements of society in
return for providing their
sons and daughters school
education and ensuring
that they were vaccinated.
Thus, a new middle class
arose for the first time in
the history of the country,
to the chagrin of the
Brazilian elites, who had
benefitted for centuries
from the extreme ine-
quality. It should also be
remembered that class and
race in Brazil are strongly
correlated: the whiter
your skin looks, the more
likely you are to belong to
the well-off class.
The economic transfor-
mation was accompanied
by a religious one. Brazil,
historically a uniformly
Catholic country, became
fertile ground for the
American branches
of Protestantism that
advocate the prosperity
gospel (which are part
of the wider Evangelical
movement in the USA),
a theology that states that
it is God’s will to acquire
wealth. The Evangelicals
have gone from being
statistically insignificant
to forming 20% of the
Brazilian population in
2010.
In the past 10 years,
the worldwide economic
downturn has hit Brazil
pretty badly. The formerly
emergent economy was in
recession between 2014
and 2016. The difficult
economic situation lead to
the impeachment of Dilma
Rousseff, Lula’s succes-
sor at the highest office of
the country, on charges of
corruption. The process
was seen as a farce by her
supporters, who claimed
that Rousseff had been
unfairly tried and had
been expelled from the
presidency by the actions
of obscure interest groups.
Lula himself is now in
prison, having been found
guilty of corruption in
a trial that many don’t
consider fair. With the two
biggest stalwarts of the
left discredited, the figure
of Jair Bolsonaro started
to rise.
How can Bolsonaro
be described? Well, let
his statements speak for
themselves. He said that a
female political opponent
was not even worthy of
being raped. He called
Haitian immigrants “the
scum of humanity”. He
is an ardent admirer of
churches. His popularity
propelled him to the first
place in the first round of
the presidential election,
held last Sunday.
Bolsonaro got 46.03%
of the vote nationally,
crossing the 50% mark
in the whiter southern
states of the country. He
was followed distantly by
Workers’ Party candidate
Fernando Haddad, as
Lula (who was the only
politician able of beating
Bolsonaro according to
every major poll) was in-
elligible to run due to his
sentence. Brazilians will
go to the polls again on the

Brazil’s former military
junta. In addition to all
this, he has been clear in
his homophobia, racism,
sexism and anti-poor
views (he is a proponent
of the forced sterilisation
of the lower classes, as
well as being a noted
climate change denialist).
Bolsonaro’s far
right demagoguery has
resonated in a country
plagued by crisis and
turmoil. He began to rise
in the polls, forming an
electoral coalition of the
new upper middle classes,
the long-standing elites,
the army and the most
socially conservative
groups in Brazillian
society, usually grouped
around the Evangelical
28th of October to choose
between Bolsonaro and
Haddad in the second
round of the election.
Bolsonaro is the last
in a long line of right
wing demagogues that
have arisen everywhere
in the world due to the
challenges brought by
globalisation. He is very
similar to the Philippines’
Rodrigo Duterte, who
infamously won the
presidency of his country
on a platform of encour-
aging the extra-judicial
killing of drug dealers. If

one believes his rhetoric,
Bolsonaro will bring the
country back to the time
of the authoritarian junta.
His victory would also
affect the global fight
against climate change, as
Bolsonaro has proposed
increasing the exploita-
tion of the Amazonian
rainforest, the planet’s
largest green expanse.
Thus, it may not be not
an exaggeration to state
that the fate of the world
will be decided by the
Brazilian electorate in two
weeks. May they choose
wisely.
