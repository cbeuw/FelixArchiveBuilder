BlacKkKlansman: A Klever koncious Komedy
A
h, the seventies
— a vibrant
era of yester-
year, whose
key highlights include
the heinous hairdos,
sleaze-core fashion, disco
music, and of course, the
racial tension between
white and black peoples
of America. However,
BlacKkKlansman is far
from a period piece, as
director Spike Lee embel-
lishes what is essentially
a buddy-cop movie into
an African-American
nightmare.
This is the story of Ron
Stalworth, (John David
Washington) who was the
first black police officer
in the Colorado Springs,
Colorado Police Depart-
ment. When Ron spots
an advert in the papers
about joining the Ku
Klux Klan, he telephones
them pretending to be a
white supremacist. Ron
successfully convinces
them over the phone, and
when it comes to meeting
them in person, his col-
league Flip Zimmerman
(Adam Driver) fills in
as Ron-the-white-su-
premacist counterpart.
It’s quickly evident that
the Klan have much
darker intentions than the
seemingly non-violent
front, and it’s up to Ron
to prevent an impending
disaster.
BlacKkKlansman is
based on an absurd true
story; of course, there are
some important dramatic
liberties that drive the plot
forward, but the central
idea of a black man
becoming a member of
the KKK is preposterous.
As serious as the subject
matter is, this central
conceit is an almost
humorous one; something
out of a satirical comedy
sketch—and the film
doesn’t shy away from
this at all. There are plenty
of comical moments that
thoughout the film that
provide breathing space
through, and on the whole
it does work smoothly
enough.
It’s hardly surprising
that Jordan Peele is
credited as a producer,
as his fingerprints are all
over BlacKkKlansman;
the fine balance between
humour and horror
is handled robustly.
However, BlacKkKlans-
man is surprisingly
toothless when it comes
to the portrayal of racism
and the KKK. There’s
plenty of jeopardy, but
it’s explored in a safe
environment and not as
powerful as it ought to be.
Having said that, there are
hugely effective moments
throughout the film.
There is a heart-stopping
scene involving white
policemen misreading a
situation that is complete-
ly tragic but relieves the
tension with humour. The
final montage of scenes is
utterly haunting and the
parallel-cutting between
the Klan and the black
activists is poignant.
What you don’t get is
a film about the KKK,
but a socially conscious
comedy that packs a
punch.
BlacKkKlansman is as
enjoyable a film you could
possibly get about the Ku
Klux Klan—which in this
case is really enjoyable (if
that’s not too politically
incorrect to say). On
the one hand, it juggles
the weight of a racially
volatile period of history
and on the other, it ticks
all the right boxes for the
laughs. When you boil it
down, its skeleton resem-
bles a simple fish-out-of-
water comedy, albeit a
very well executed one.
It’s not Get Out, but then
again, what is?
