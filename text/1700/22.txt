The Funny, the Painful and Everything in Between
“Humour is
the thread
that allows
for genuine
human
connection,
a medium
for common
under-
standing”
T
his is what my
mother and I like
to talk about,”
says Karla de-
fensively, as Don shouts
at her from across the
flimsy hospital curtains
to shut up. “Yes, but this
is a hospital!” Don retorts.
Karla, an aspiring stand-
up comedian, had been
practicing permutations
of lines like “I have been
single for so long, I have
started fantasising about
my vibrator.” Not appro-
priate for a hospital room
with two women suffering
from cancer, Don thinks.
This initial dismissal
of humour in the opening
lines sets the scene for the
subsequent exploration
and observations of the
role of humour in pain
and suffering in Halley
Feiffer’s new play. A
Funny Thing... follows
the relationship between a
young stand-up comedian
and a middle-aged man
in the throes of divorce,
brought together in the
same hospital room where
their mothers are being
hospitalised for cancer.
Immediately, the juxta-
position between Karla’s
raunchy jokes and the air
of death in the hospital
setting becomes clear,
and it is this relationship
that the intermission-less,
80 minute play goes on
to explore with wit and
tenderness.
The antagonism
between the two visitors is
broken by Marcie, Karla’s
mother, who croaks “She’s
dead!” as the conversation
between them turns to
Karla’s sister. Karla
bursts into uncontrollable
laughter, while Don stands
awkwardly, unsure of how
to respond. The timing of
her mother’s comment
tickles Karla, despite the
tragedy of the situation.
Gallows humour is a way
for Karla to deal with the
pain, pain which bursts
through the surface and
reveals itself when, much
later, she talks about her
sister’s death with her
mother.
Indeed, in the midst of
Karla and Don’s outward-
ly witty conversations and
flippant lines, we learn of
the difficulties that each
is in, and how comple-
mentary these problems
are. Karla is poor and just
starting out, but confident
and self-assured in the
direction she will go. Don
made his fortune from a
tech start-up that he has
no personal interest in,
suggested by his wife
who is about to leave him.
He first appears dressed
“like a homeless man”
despite his wealth, an
outward manifestation
of the mess his life is in,
and talks with an air of
resignation. As might be
expected, Karla’s prickly
nature hides a backstory
– one that is revealed
when Marcie awakes, and
puts her down with every
comment she makes.
As with any romantic
comedy, two characters
that are initially an-
tagonistic must end up
together. Karla reveals
a moment of weakness
being upset at how her
mother treats her and her
sister’s death, and Don’s
tender response suddenly
explodes into one of the
most visual and ludicrous
sex scenes I have seen on
stage. While slightly un-
necessary, it was certainly
(perhaps awkwardly)
funny, and took the con-
nection between them to
a graphic, symbolic level.
This connection that
Don and Karla experience
is a shared acknowledge-
ment of each other’s
suffering, that despite
their very different life
circumstances, they are
brought together in shared
grief for their mothers’
suffering. What the play
does well is that it does
not pretend that jokes and
humour are so that one can
“smile through the pain”
– it is deeper than that.
Rather, it is an observation
that humour is the thread
that allows for genuine
human connection, that it
is a medium for common
understanding. In fact,
sometimes it might be
difficult to distinguish
humour from pain. When
Don’s mother Geena dies,
he says tentatively to
Marcie that he found his
situation then “funny”.
“It’s not funny,” Marcie
replies. “What you feel is
relief that your mother is
dead, not that it is funny.”
Cariad Lloyd is brilliant
as Karla, balancing the
self-assurance of youth
with her insecurity, while
delivering her comedic
lines well. Rob Crouch
is a suitably scruffy Don,
and carries the mid-life
crisis aura well. Kristin
Milward makes a bril-
liantly acerbic sick mum,
and while Cara Chase, as
Geena, gets only a few
lines in the play, she does
her part well. The intimate
setting and importance of
dialogue means that one’s
experience could be very
dependent on the cast, and
I’m glad to say that this
small cast has delivered
excellently. The setting of
the Finborough Theatre is
perfect, a small, intimate
space above a pleasant
pub. One almost feels like
the audience fits into the
hospital room, and can
partake in the interactions
between strangers, just as
how Don and Karla have.
This play is a comedy,
but comments on very
real issues of city life,
from Don’s son’s drug
problems to class differ-
ences between the two.
Ultimately it celebrates
human connection – the
shared suffering, but
also shared laughter. It
is tender without being
heavy, hilarious and witty
without being slapstick,
and definitely worth a
watch.
