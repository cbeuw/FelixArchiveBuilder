We’ve all heard the
age-old advice; save up
for a rainy day, spend
a little less, invest that
money and have enough
to retire. Your favourite
car, that house in the
countryside, that trip to
the Maldives you’ve been
planning since the days of
eating lunch at your desk.
The message is clear,
invest for the future. As
we meticulously allocate
funds to reap returns,
so do countries through
sovereign wealth funds
(SWF).
SWFs are the
investment funds of
countries, which invest
for the long-term benefit
of its economy and
its citizens. Funds are
derived from accumulated
trade and budget surpluses
and from the exportation
of natural resources.
Sources are split between
commodity-based and
non-commodity-based
sources. Oil and gas
forms more than 50%
of global SWF funding.
Some countries even
have multiple funds to
meet specific investment
goals of its government.
According to SWF
Institute, the 10 largest
SWFs in the world at time
of writing consist mainly
of Middle Eastern and
Asian funds, except for
Norway’s Government
Pension Fund. It holds the
title of the largest SWF in
the world, having more
than $1 trillion of assets
under management.
The Linaburg-Maduell
Transparency Index
measures the transparency
of a fund’s operations
on metrics such as how
transparent it is about
holdings, government
ownership structure,
investment process and
objective. Funds are
ranked from 1 to 10,
Investment Fund were
set up to meet the future
of depleted oil wells,
stricter environmental
regulations, and the
proliferation of cheaper
green-energy alternatives
that renders hydrocarbon
extraction uneconomic.
Macro-stabilisation
funds are designed to
mitigate the effects of
the resource curse, an
economic phenomenon
in resource-rich countries
that results in high
government spending with
soaring commodity prices,
followed by austerity
during downturns. Money
is drawn down from these
funds to make up for the
loss of revenue, injecting
liquidity and smoothing
out the peaks and troughs
of government spending.
The funds are also used
to help stabilise the value
of a country’s currency
during macroeconomic
shocks. For these reasons,
investment horizons are
short and involve mainly
liquid assets.
Pensive reserve funds
invest to build capital for
their government’s future
pension obligations.
An example would be
Singapore’s GIC, which
manages funds from
Singapore’s Central
Provident Fund, a
compulsory savings plan
for working Singaporeans
to fund their retirement,
healthcare, and housing
needs. Returns between
1% and 5% are guaranteed
by the government. GIC
manages a fixed pool
of the country’s savings
and foreign reserves to
generate good long-term
returns that beat global
inflation.
Strategic funds can
form part of a country’s
domestic economic
policies, investing in
strategic industries to
nurture their development,
promoting growth in the
domestic and international
economy as well as
providing generous
returns. They provide key
early funding to small
and medium enterprises
and may take longer-term
stakes to facilitate the
growth in later stages
of the business cycle.
Some are even pro-active
managers, assisting in
restructuring and funding
of distressed companies.
Whilst such funds tend
to have a domestic focus,
some have reaped returns
and dividends to venture
into overseas markets.
Singapore’s Temasek
initially managed various
state-owned-enterprises
but eventually transitioned
into a more globally
orientated portfolio with
stakes in Alibaba and
Standard Chartered,
while retaining a sizable
domestic portfolio. In
January 2018, Temasek
joined Google in investing
in Indonesian ride-hailing
firm Go-Jek, which is
preparing to launch in
Singapore in October
2018 to compete with
Malaysian rival Grab.
Apart from Norway and
Singapore, several large
SWFs have been facing
scrutiny,particularlyfunds
from the Middle East,
scoring an average of 5
on the transparency index.
The lack of transparency
in these funds’ sizes
and objectives, coupled
with close links to their
governments, have led to
speculations of politically
motivated investments.
SWFs can clandestinely
acquire strategic assets of
another country, stealing
proprietary information,
patented technology
and trade secrets. The
bailout of major U.S
financial firms during the
global financial crises of
2007-2008 by Asian and
Middle Eastern SWFs
and the subsequent poor
performance from these
investments increased
debate on investment
strategies and put pressure
on managers to avoid
further losses.
These funds are
institutional investors with
large sums of capital ready
to be injected. The range
of companies they invest
in adds to the available
pool of capital accessible
across the life cycle of
businesses. Savings and
pension funds invest
current earnings for future
generations, allowing
individuals and countries
to continue participating
in the domestic and
international economy
for years to come. In
times of need, SWFs
have aided distressed
companies, both domestic
and international. Despite
criticism, SWFs have their
place in the international
capital market.
from the non-transparent
or “opaque” to the most
transparent.
SWFs are split into
4 broad categories;
savings, macro-
stabilisation, pension
reserve and strategic
funds. They differ in their
investment objectives
and methodologies,
such as having a short
or long-term investment
horizon, and projected
liquidity requirements
(indicating the frequency
of future withdrawals
from the fund). Each
fund is split across 4 asset
classes; cash, equities,
fixed-income (bonds) and
alternative investments
such as private equity,
hedge funds and real
estate. In general, funds
with longer investment
horizons will be heavily
weighted in equities as
the longer time frame
would ride out short-
term market volatility
and allow investments
to bear fruit. Alternative
assets tend to be found
on funds with longer
horizons, requiring longer
planning and execution
to exit profitably. Shorter
investment horizons
necessitate a larger
proportion of liquid
assets to meet large and
often unexpected capital
outflows due to higher
liquidity requirements.
Most SWFs are savings
and macro-stabilisation
funds.
Savings funds preserve
and grow a country’s
wealth for the future and
have investment horizons
that span decades.
Countries rich in lucrative
but inevitably finite
natural resources such as
oil, gas, precious metals
and other commodities,
channel revenue from
sales into savings funds.
This ensures future
generations can reap the
benefits of a depleted
or stranded resource.
SWFs such as the Kuwait
Investment Authority
and Saudi Arabia Public
