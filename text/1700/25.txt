W
atching all
those Food
I n s i d e r
videos on
Facebook on a mundane
afternoon undoubtedly
leaves us all drooling,
daydreaming about those
Instagram-worthy des-
serts – just think of the
food envy your friends
will experience when they
see a boomerang of that
food! So naturally, you
tag your friends saying,
“we should go!”, knowing
well it’s probably not
going to happen because
something always comes
up – your bank account
is a little broken after
all those nights out, one
of you is too busy at the
library, or like us, maybe
you just prefer to spend
your time napping.
However, one day, my
friend and I decided to
set out on a quest to try
each and every dessert
place we came across
on social media – no
better way to spend your
student finance, right? We
decided to hit up the cap-
ital’s foodie hotspot first
– Westfield London. From
the famous Mr. Pretzel
cinnamon sugar pretzels
to bubble waffles to
ice-cream and pancakes,
this place was absolutely
packed and buzzing on
yummy, picturesque
desserts – all just ready
for us to eat and eat and
eat!
First place on our
dessert hit list was Naked
Dough. Located on the
first floor, this little cookie
dough cafe stall could not
possibly be missed with
its lively setup and bright,
vibrant display. The
cookie dough flavours had
usbothbaffled,withsucha
wide range to choose from
for the tubs and dough
cones they did, including
lotus biscuits, mud bath
(aka death by chocolate),
Nutella, ‘Unicorn Food’
(marshmallows and sprin-
kles), and a very tempting
salted caramel and
honeycomb. There was
also plenty of toppings
which you could mix-and-
match. The smallest size,
costing just under £5,
we thought a bit pricey
but seeing the massive
portion a girl before us
received, we changed our
minds (do not get a larger
size than the normal, or
you will die). Though all
of that was fantastic, we
were there for actually
eating the food, and
with no due hesitation,
we decided to order the
biggest thing we could
find – the Dough Freak.
Two scoops of mouth-wa-
teringly soft ice-cream
stuffed in-between two
scoops of *arguably* the
best cookie dough to ever
exist, plus free unlimited
toppings. One taste of it
and we were questioning
reality – surely this was
what actual heaven felt
like?
After how successful
our first Westfield trip
was, we had high expecta-
tions for our next dessert
adventure, and naturally
we had to hit up Bubble
on Waffle, one of the most
Instagrammed dessert
placesin London – but was
it going to live up to the
bar set by Naked Dough?
Though we didn’t have as
many flavours to choose
from, we still had quite
the predicament because
who could really choose
between a heavenly
hazelnut Ferrero Rocher,
strawberry shortcake
goodness and a blissful
banana split? Also, I
mean, who could resist
the combination of a hot
waffle with the cooling ice
cream centre? At roughly
£7 per waffle, this was
fairly expensive, but we
were hoping it would be
worth it. Unfortunately,
the taste and practicality
did not match the waffles’
looks; the waffle was
soggy and began falling
apart after a few minutes,
and the ice-cream didn’t
quite taste of the flavour
it was meant to be. All in
all, a bit bland really, but
at least we got some pretty
cool photos out of it – you
win some, you lose some,
eh?
Not fazed by the short-
comings of the bubble
waffle, the last trip was to a
donut store in Soho called
Doughnut Time. The size
of the shop was tiny; basi-

cally a stand on the street
(the only option was to
Bubble on Waffle // Eva Tadros
get takeaway doughnuts,
no place to eat-in) and
we didn’t really know
what to expect, although
a queue was present and
growing (a queue for any
kind of food is always
good, right?) As we got
nearer, our first glance at
the display made all our
doubts disappear. From
PercyPigtoOreotoM&M
donuts, every donut had a
‘theme’, both aesthetics
and flavour wise. The
Percy Pig donut was pale,
with pink frosting and of
course a couple Percy Pigs
on top, while the Oreo
one was made of black
dough and was encrusted
with broken Oreo chunks.
There was even filled
doughnuts, such as the

tuned for future updates
on more yummy food
places to try – and a
timeline of how much our
waistlines expand…
This venue definitely
left us looking for more
dessert places through
social media for the future
– after all, 67% success
rate is pretty good (it’s
almost a First, am I right?)

Kinder Bueno doughnut
filled with Nutella and
topped with, of course,
Kinder Bueno. Looking at
the assortment, we were
extremely impressed – not
only did all the options
look mouth-watering, but
there were multiple (!)
vegan options to choose
from, such as Red Velvet!
Although the price was
£4 (for a doughnut?!), the
flavour did not disappoint.
The dough itself was
pretty classic, but the
special toppings really
made it a delicious treat.
The amount of frosting
and icing on top was
also very generous – we
definitely needed a LOT
of water after to deal with
the sugar overload. Worth
the £4? Not on a regular
basis, but definitely worth
a try at least once or twice
to test out some cool
flavours.
The conclusion? Social
media, although it is
known for popularising
aesthetic and not neces-
sarily delicious places,
also showed us quite a few
gems that can be discov-
ered too. With more and
more places opening up at
Westfield every day, this
is definitely our number
one place to watch, but
who says you can’t look
