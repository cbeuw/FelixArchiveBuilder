Nobel Season: A Summary of the Prizes for 2018
A quick tour of who’s who and what’s what in this year’s greatest scientific achievements
L
ast week was
Nobel Prize
season, and
whilst it’s not
quite as glamorous as the
Oscars, it comes with a lot
of prestige and a chance to
go down in history. These
yearly prizes are award-
ed to those who make
significant contributions
in several categories out-
lined in the will of Alfred
Nobel, with the three in
science being given to
Medicine, Physics and
Chemistry. So, this week
Felix Science will give
you a rundown of the
three science winners so
you can sound cool and
clever at welcome drinks.
The week began with
the announcement of the
Nobel in Physiology and
Medicine, which was
awarded to James Allison
and Tasuku Honjo for
the discovery of cancer
therapy by inhibition of
negative immune regu-
lation, more commonly
known as immunotherapy.
The immune system is a
powerful tool, and so di-
recting it towards cancer
therapy has been the
dream of many scientists
for a long time. However,
at that time the systems
in place to regulate the
immune system were
still a bit of a mystery.
James Allison’s work
focused on the catchily
named CTLA-4, a protein
involved in reducing
T-Cell function. They
developed an antibody
that binds to this protein,
inhibiting it and therefore
increasing the immune
response to a tumour. The
results in mice were im-
pressive, but many com-
panies were reluctant to
try it, as playing with the
immune system is always
risky business. However,
eventually one company
was brave enough, and
this finally led to the de-
velopment of Yervoy, an
immunotherapy antibody
for melanoma.
The second half of the
prize goes to the discovery
of PD-1, byTasuku Honjo.
This protein is similar in
function to CTLA-4, and
acts as another regulatory
system to keep T-cells in
check. Honjo also devel-
oped an antibody for this
protein, and nowadays
there are several oncology
treatments based on PD-1
in the clinic. Immunother-
apy has been a revolution
in cancer treatment and
has saved the lives of
many people. What is
equally exciting however
is that this revolution is
still going. There are still
papers coming out on this
subject, and only time will
tell how these will impact
how we treat cancer.
This year’s Physics
Nobel went to ‘Advances
in Laser Physics’ and
was split, with one half
going to Arthur Ashkin
for the development of
optical tweezers, and the
other half going to Gérard
Mourou and Donna
Strickland for their work
in the development of
high-intensity ultra-short
laser pulses.
Optical tweezers are
a somewhat futuristic
sounding tool that utilise
lasers to trap and manip-
ulate particles. These take
advantage of the ability
of light to exert force or
radiation pressure on an
object, and it was with the
advent of lasers that the
ability to use this force
became a possibility.
Optical tweezers have
been shown to be able
to move atoms, whole
cells, and even organelles
within a cell, and they
have a myriad of uses
throughout science. The
other half of the Nobel
went to the generation of
high-intensity ultra-short
laser pulses by Mourou
and Strickland. Whilst this
sounds a lot less exciting
on the surface, they are
vital for laser eye surgery
and in laser machining.
Mourou and Strickland
created chirped pulse
amplification by stretch-
ing the pulse in time and
reducing the peak power,
then amplifying the pulse ,
and finally recompressing
the pulse in time resulting
in large power pulses. This
meant that pulsed laser
devices became smaller
and cheaper and opened
up new areas of physics
and led to development of
corrective eye surgery.
Donna Strickland is the
third woman ever to win
the Nobel in physics, and
her win has reignited the
debate about recognising
women in science. She is
currently not a full pro-
fessor and, until roughly
90 minutes after the prize
was announced, she didn’t
have a Wikipedia page
as she wasn’t deemed
noteworthy enough.
Considering ‘Dusty the
Klepto Kitty’ made the
cut, that reason seems to
be misjudged.
Finally, the Chemistry
Nobel prize was an-
nounced, and this year half
went to Frances Arnold
for directed evolution of
enzymes, and the other
half to George P. Smith
and Sir Gregory P. Winter
for the phage display of
antibodies and peptides.

Now, some of the more
keen-eyed readers might
be thinking ‘hang on, that
sounds an awful lot like
biology’, but since there’s
no prize for biology,
the major contributions
in areas like chemical
biology get lumped into
the chemistry prize.

solvent system that would
have destroyed the starting
enzyme. Since then there
have been a great many

oped, including modified
lipases that break down

can do things that natural
enzymes cannot. This
involves taking enzymes
and inducing a series of
random mutations, and
then weeding out the ones
that are better at doing
what you want and then
doing the whole thing all
over again. The original
work tested this by pro-
ducing an enzyme that
The rest of the prize is
for the related technique
of phage display. This
uses bacteriophages, a
virus that infects bacteria,
to produce antibodies.
Bacteriophages display
proteins on their surface,
and Smith worked out that
they could produce any
protein when the correct
gene was inserted. Winters
then used an evolutionary
method like the one devel-
oped byArnold to produce
antibody-based drugs.
Today there are several
antibody-based drugs on
the market, and the list is
growing every day.
