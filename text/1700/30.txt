UEFA Nations League: explained
With the second international break upon us, it’s time to find out what’s actually going on...

T
his week the
Premier League
takes a break and
the second round
of fixtures in the all-new
UEFA Nations League
are taking place, but
what even is the Nations
League?
News stories circulated
back before the first
fixture that England gaffer
Gareth Southgate had
tried to explain the new
competition format to the
team but the complexity
went over the head of
the likes of star defender
Harry Maguire.
15 in League C, and 16 in
League D.
Within each league
there are 4 groups, with 3
or 4 teams in each group.
Each team plays every
other team in their group
both home and away with
each league ending with
4 group-winners and 4
group-losers.
The groups were
selected by drawing
teams from pools based
on the order of the team’s
UEFA coefficients (e.g.
for League A there were
3 pools of 4 teams with
teams ranked 1-4 in Pool
A, those ranked 5-8 in
Pool B, and the 9-12
ranked sides in Pool C).
It is also worth noting
that due to winter venue
restrictions, a group in
League C could contain a
maximum of two of these
teams: Norway, Finland,
Estonia, and Lithuania.
Similarly, due to exces-
sive travel restrictions, no
group in League D could
contain more than one of
these pairs: Andorra &
Kazakhstan, Faroe Islands
& Kazakhstan, Gibraltar
& Kazakhstan, Gibraltar
& Azerbaijan.
There are 6 matchdays
for the Nations League,
but as they have fewer
teams, those in Leagues
A & B will only play on
4 of these. This is why in
mid-September England
took on Spain and Switzer-
land in quick-succession,
losing to Spain 2-1 in their
first game of the Nations
League whilst beating the
Swiss 1-0 in a friendly
rather than playing their
second Nations League
match.
After all the games
have been played, each
group-winner (excluding
those in League A) is
automatically promoted
to the league above them,
and each group-loser (ex-
cluding those in League
D) is relegated to the

Additionally, the four
group-winners of League
A will qualify for the
Nations League finals next
June. This will be played
in a knockout format
with the two semi-final
pairings selected from an
open draw and the first-
round matches followed
by a third-place place-off
and a grand final to crown
the first winners of the
UEFA Nations League.
with a capacity of at least
30,000 and located in the
same host city, or at least
within 150km of each
other.
The tournament is
played over the months
of September-November
in even-numbered years,
with the finals being held
in June of the following
odd-numbered year.
So how does this fit
into qualifying for the
2020 Euros?
Well, European qual-
ifying will go ahead as
normal during March-No-
vember 2019 with the
winner and runner-up of
10 groups qualifying for
the Euros, filling 20 of
the available 24 places in
the final tournament. The
Nations League is used to
fill the final 4 places, with
the play-offs taking place
in March 2020.

The competition sees
the 55 UEFA national
teams divided into 4
divisions (the “leagues”),
based on their UEFA
National Team Coefficient
Rankings (England are
currently ranked 7th). Due
to the awkward number of
teams under the UEFA
umbrella, there are 12
teams in Leagues A & B,
The finals will be hosted
by a randomly selected
bidding nation from
this final quartet. UEFA
announced in March
that Italy, Poland, and
Portugal had expressed an
interest in bidding before
the August deadline, so as
all three of these teams are
in the same group (3) in
League A it is likely that
the winner of Group 3 will
host the finals provided
their bids fulfilled the
criteria outlined by
UEFA. This includes the
preference for the finals to
be played in two stadiums
put into 4 separate knock-
outs with the winner of
each 2 game knockout
securing one of the final 4
places at the Euros. In the
case that there are fewer
than 4 teams in a league
that do not qualify for the
Euros, the highest-ranked
remaining team will be
entered into that knockout.
The highest-ranked
team in each of the
semi-finals will host the
match, with the host of
the final for each of the 4
play-offs determined by a
draw.
The rankings are based
on position in the group
then points, goal differ-
ence, goals scored, away
goals scored, wins, away
wins, disciplinary points,
and finally coefficient
ranking.
Does that all make
sense? Good.
Time to get revenge
against Croatia…

F1 season review: post Japanese Grand Prix
Politics editor Divyen Vanniasegaram weighs in on the affairs of the 2018 F1 Championship.

ollowing the
Japanese Grand
Prix Vettel’s
chances of
winning the 2018 F1
Championship have di-
minished to barely more
than a dream. Following
a season in which both
Hamilton and Vettel have
been closely matched
throughout this is a bitter
pill to swallow for Ferrari.
Following the first 10
races where a maximum
of 250 points were on
offer only 8 points sep-
arated the drivers with
Vettel barely ahead. This
was indicative of an
enthralling contest where
the title battle swung one
way then the next with
plenty of surprise results
along the way. This had
been by far the most
interesting Championship
battle for nearly a decade
with both drivers aiming
for their 5th world title.
However, Hamilton has
outscored Vettel by 75
points in the last 7 races
and turned an 8-point
deficit into a massive
67-point advantage with
only 4 races remaining.
He can now wrap up the
Championship at the next
Grand Prix in the USA.
This would have been un-
thinkable even a couple of
months ago. So how have
we got to this point?
Ferrari and Vettel have
simply made too many
errors in a contest of this
nature with the margins so
fine. It has been a decade
since Ferrari last won
a Championship battle
whilst Mercedes have won
every title since 2014.
Mercedes has become
a well-oiled winning
machine, demonstrated by
their use of team orders
in Russia to ask Bottas,
Hamilton’s teammate,
to move over so that
Hamilton could win the
race and further extend
his lead over Vettel. Vettel
himself has made signifi-
cant errors throughout the
Championship including
at the German Grand Prix
where he spun off out of
the race whilst leading, in
Italy where he defended
his position too hard and
was sent into a spin ending
up at the back of the field
and in Japan where he
tried to dive down the
inside Verstappen which
yet again saw him spun
around and at the back
of the field. In total his
errors have probably cost
him conservatively 70
points in points directly
lost and points gained
by Hamilton as a direct
result of his errors. Given
this he should be ahead in
standings.
Vettel is a 4-time world
champion who is used to
the pressure. He won his
first championship having
been only 3rd coming
into the final race of the
season and had to fight
off Alonso, considered
one of the greatest drivers
of the modern era, in a
tight battle to win his 3rd
championship as well.
This is in no so small part
down to his relationship
with Ferrari. Driving for
Ferrari itself brings on
more pressure given the
prestige and the expecta-
tion. On top of this Vettel
doesn’t seem to have
faith in Ferrari to execute
effectively to give him the
best chance to win. He has
often called into question
Ferrari’s strategy from
the car and attempted
without merit. Ferrari
have also made a series of
operational errors which
have cost Vettel. Most
notably in Italy where
Vettel’s teammate ended
up on pole position when
Ferrari could easily have
manufactured a situation
to put Vettel on pole and in
Japan where Ferrari sent
Vettel out on the wrong
tyres designed for wet
conditions when the track
was dry enough to use
slick tyres. Whilst a bor-
derline decision the rest of
the field managed to get
it right, so the question
is why didn’t Ferrari.
Hamilton has made errors
as well, particularly by not
extracting most out of the
car in the early part of the
season. Mercedes have
been guilty of slipping up
such as in Austria where
Hamilton initially lost the
lead due to a team error
and then ultimately retired
from the race with a me-
chanical problem with his
car. However, these errors
have been few and far
between and significantly
there is a great synergy in
the team, with the team
and Hamilton working
effectively together to
bridge their respective
flaws, such as in Russia
where Hamilton was
able to overtake Vettel
following a team error
which allowed Vettel to
get in front. It is clear that
Hamilton trusts his team
100% to make the right
calls and he therefore only
has to focus on driving as
fast as he can.
Hamilton has all but
sealedthetitleforthisyear,
but it has been a fantastic
year in Formula 1. It is en-
couraging to see 2 teams
slugging it out having
seen Mercedes dominate
since 2014. Ferrari will
rue what could have been
considering they’ve had a
car fast enough to win the
championship this year
and will need to build on
the success they’ve had
this year. With the cars
being redesigned next
year to aid overtaking and
hopefully Ferrari pushing
Mercedes even closer for
the title, the 2019 season
looks set to be a cracker.
