mechanisms”

T
he 2018
Nobel Prize in
Physiology or
Medicine went
to James P. Allison and
Tasuku Honjo for the “dis-
covery of cancer therapy
by inhibition of negative
immune regulation.”
Be it bacteria, virus or
cancer cell, no foreign
molecule can expect a
warm welcome to our
body. T-cells, a type of
white blood cells, bind
themselves to potentially
dangerous intruders,
which triggers the immune
system to defend us. Ad-
ditionally, some types of
proteins accelerate the full
immune system response,
while others inhibit it.
This way our immune
system attacks threatening
intruders but leaves our
own healthy cells alone. A
typical war strategy: kill
enemy soldiers, protect
ours.
Unfortunately, cancer
manages to fool this
so-called ‘checkpoint
system’ by pretending
to be a normal part of
our body. The latest
Nobel Prize laureates
independently proposed
special drugs called
“checkpoint inhibitors”,
which suppress proteins
responsible for blocking
our immune system. Now,
the immune system gets
a chance to assess cancer
cells as “non-self” and
destroy them. This way,
the body can fight against
cancer using natural
mechanisms, with just
a little boost from drugs
based on immunotherapy.
Allison and Honjo
bring hope to patients
for whom none of
surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy would be
available, for a variety
of reasons. Their work
inspired numerous clinical
trials, with successes in
lung cancer, renal cancer,
lymphoma and melanoma
(skin cancer).
Whilst side effects of
checkpoint therapy can
be as dangerous and un-
pleasant as of other cancer
treatments, our knowledge
of autoimmune reactions
allows us to manage them
better. Current research
focuses on explaining and
treating these side effects
even more effectively.
“Cancer kills millions
of people every year
and is one of humanity’s
greatest health challenges.
By stimulating the ability
of our immune system to
attack tumour cells, this
year’s Nobel Prize laure-
ates have established an
entirely new principle for
cancer therapy”, we can
read at the Nobel Prize
official Twitter account.
Did we find ‘the cure’
for cancer? Probably not.
But Allison and Honjo’s
research can definitely
save hundreds of lives.
Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: Science on why we can’t stop
eating
SCIENCE

I
lied to myself again:
“I will just have one
more,” as I engulfed
the whole bag of
crisps. Interestingly, this
gluttonous behaviour can
be explained by science,
so we are not to be blamed
entirely.
In the brain, there
are two main types of
neurones that impact our
appetite in the hypothal-
amus: those that make us
crave food (orexigenic),
and the other suppresses
this desire (anorexigenic).
An example of orexigenic
neurones would be the
cells expressing proopi-
omelanocortin (POMC),
which is a stress-related
gene; and an example
of anorexigenic neuron
would be agouti-related
protein (AgRP), where
it is known that agou-
ti-expressing mice are
generally obese. These
nerve cells respond to
nutrient and hormonal
signal (e.g. leptin) and
together, the two systems
work together to regulate
appetite, energy expendi-
ture and importantly, body
weight. Yet, we don’t have
a complete understanding
of the interplay of these
neurons and a recent study
published in Proceedings
of the National Academy
of Sciences aimed to shed
light into this question,
literally.
Using optogenetic
techniques, neurones
were activated using
light. Together with
neural activity mapping
and brain transparency
visualisation techniques,
the researchers at the
University of Michigan
demonstrated the ano-
rexigenic and orexigenic
nature of neurons that
express POMC or AgRP
respectively.
In the study, the mice
with activated POMC
neurones stopped eating
though they were starved
4 hours before feeding.
POMC is a gene that
codes for stress hormones,
therefore it makes as
much sense as eating
would probably be the last
thing we want to do when
we face a life-threatening
situation. However, if
both AgRP and POMC
neurones were activated,
the group of mice in-
creased food intake. This
suggests the neurons that
put the brakes on eating
are overridden by the
neurones that promote
eating. In other words, the
‘I must eat more’ mech-
anism is stronger than
the ‘I think I will stop’
mechanism – that’s why
we keep eating when we
are full.
To explore how this
was brought about, the
scientists visualised the
neuronal network in the
brain that received protein
signals from POMC and
AgRP neurones. Results
showed that the two
systems have a different
neuronal activation
pattern, in which the
insatiable mouse group
has a much broader and
wider response area in
the brain compared to the
group where anorexigenic
neurones were activated.
To investigate potential
mechanism of how
the change of appetite
is brought about, the
scientists gave the mice
naloxone, a drug that
blocks opioid receptors.
Results suggest the effect
of increased food intake is
likely to be mediated by
the opioid receptor-sig-
nalling system, the same
system that regulates
sodium appetite (craving
salty food) and aids in
regulating pain.
All these interesting
findings certainly help
increase our under-
standing of the appetite
control mechanisms,
which could potentially
target the pathway to
up- or down-regulate our
appetite, thereby treating
issues like obesity. Whilst
the use of pharmacologic
treatment (naloxone) in
the experiment suggested
a slight possibility to
translate this knowledge
into a medical treatment,
the difference in mice
and men means that
factors such as stress and
emotions were not in-
vestigated. Furthermore,
as mentioned, the opioid
receptor signalling system
is also involved in other
important features, hence,
a ‘magic pill’ is not likely
to be ready soon. Long-
term effects should also
be investigated before
making any therapeutic
claims.
To conclude, scien-
tists have shown that
over-eating is caused by
an overpowering signal
from the ‘please eat
more’ neurones, which,
in mice can be inhibited
by drugs. However, more
work needs to be done to
understand the topic, as
humans are greatly differ-
ent from mice, especially
in terms of psychology
and experiences to social
triggers. In the meantime,
I guess willpower is all
we have to stop us from
overeating.

Moths at Midnight
Recent research from the University of York gives an insight into the night-time pollination activities of moths. A
pollination service that may be of great ecological importance, which has been overlooked, until now.
W
e all know
that polli-
nation is an
invaluable
process, critical for both
the maintenance of eco-
systems and continued
agricultural production.
With growing pressure
on agriculture to sustain
the inflating human
population, the role of
pollinators is becoming
increasingly important.
In spite of global declines
across many pollinating
insect species, the con-
servation discussion tends
to focus on day-time pol-
linators, in particular the
plight of bees. However,
recent research from the
University of York has
demonstrated that the
night-time activities of
moths may play a much
greater role in pollination
that we had previously
thought.
Due to the technical
challenges of observing
nocturnal animals, moths
are relatively understud-
ied compared to day-time
pollinator species. In the
University of York study,
researchers genetically
analysed pollen found
on moths to characterise
previously unstudied
plant-moth interactions
and identify pollen-trans-
port networks within a
UK agrosystem. In so
doing they identified
many plants that were not
previously thought to be
pollinated by moths and
found that moths pollinate
a number of important
agricultural crops. These
include potato, soya bean
and oil-seed rape. Many
moth-pollinated plant
species are also known to
be pollinated by day-time
insects. This may confer
a selective advantage
for these plant species if
current pollinator declines
continue.
Moth pollinators tend
to travel greater distances
whilst foraging compared
to their day-time coun-
terparts. Consequentially,
they may facilitate
plant-geneflow across a
landscape and prevent
the deleterious effects of
inbreeding. The mainte-
nance of genetic diversity
through geneflow has
important implications
for a species evolution
and may improve survival
under future perturbations
in the environment – of
particular note, climate
change.
The contribution of
moths to pollination
services has previously
been understudied.
However, using genetic
analyses this study has
identified them as globally
relevant pollinators.
Consequentially, their
conservation is of great
importance, especially in
the face of ongoing global
declines in the numbers
of pollinating insects. The
total number of moths in
the UK is estimated to
have decreased by around
30% since 1968, this has
partly been attributed to
habitat losses, light pollu-
tion and use of pesticides.
The Univeristy of York
study goes some way to
prove that when discuss-
ing important pollinators
for the maintenance of
agricultural production,
we should include moths,
and therefore take action
to prevent their further
decline.

n Saturday
the 15th of
S e p t e m b e r ,
N A S A
launched their newest
laser, the ICESat-2, which
stands for “Ice, Cloud and
land Elevation Satellite”.
In orbit 500 km above our
heads, the satellite’s main
mission is to measure the
alarming evolution of ice
melting in the poles.
Since 2009 and
the end of the first mission
of ICESat, NASA had
no spacecraft instrument
capable of providing
information such as the
thickness of the ice in
Greenland and the Antarc-
tic. On board of the half a
tonne satellite, two lasers,
one of replacement, were
installed. Each laser is
divided into six beams
to follow as closely as
possible the slope of the
surface of Earth. With
10,000 laser pulses per
second, measurements
will be taken every 70 cen-
timetres on the trajectory
of the satellite. Thanks
to these very precise
data, NASA aims “to
estimate the annual height
change of Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets to
within 4 millimetres – the
width of a No. 2 pencil.”
ICESat-2 records the time
taken by the laser beams
to reach the Earth and to
come back to the satellite
at a very precise spatial
location. Scientists are
then able to calculate the
height of forests, glaciers
and sea ice.
Such devices
are urgently required in
today’s global warming
situation. The Arctic Sea
Ice has indeed reached its
smallest 2018 summer-
time surface area (4.59
million square kilometres)
on September 23rd. This
layer of frozen water
floating above the Arctic
Ocean extends during
wintertime and naturally
shrinks during summer.
However, since the 1970s,
the Arctic Sea Ice rapidly
reduced by 54 000 square
kilometres each year,
going from 7.01 million
square kilometres in 1980
to only 2.91 square kilo-
metres in 2012! The same
phenomena are observed
in the Antarctic, where 3
000 billion tonnes of ice
have melted since 1992,
enough to rise the global
level of the oceans by 8
millimetres! Hundreds
of millions of inhabitants
living on coastal land are
under the threat of sea
level rising! The future
measurements provided
by ICESat-2 will supply
more details to the world’s
leaders to orientate their
policies in favour of sus-
tainable development and
take action to prevent the
Earth’s temperature from
rising by more than 1.5°C
by 2022.
