REDUXER: Turning Water Into Wine

L
ast June, the
Leedsbasedindie
rock band alt-J
released their 3rd
studio album, RELAXER.
And it wasn’t good. Don’t
get me wrong, I love alt-J
just as much as the next
guy; ‘Left Hand Free’
will forever get my feet
tapping and my air drums
rocking. But RELAXER
was like looking in a fun-
house mirror of the band I
loved so much. The whole
thing just felt off, the slow
calm songs droned on, Joe
Newman’s vocals only fit
into a few of the songs well
and aside from ‘In Cold
Blood’ and ‘Deadcrush’ I
never felt engaged – more
like bored.
So I had basically given
up on alt-J, and in fact was
half pleased when they
didn’t win the Mercury
Prize – it would have
been undeserved. Then
last week REDUXER was
released. And I adore it.
Who would’ve thought
an album made up of
hip-hop remixes of tracks
from RELAXER would be
possible, let alone great.
The moment Little
Simz started rapping over
3WW it changed from a
watery mess of a song to
something dark, sinister
and just generally fucking
awesome. Little Simz’s
flow is low, laid back and
drives through the song
– the kind of thing you’d
listen to late at night
feeling like a bad boi. I
was already pumped and
it was just the first song.
The rest of the album
delivers many more rap
features from fantastic
“I’d hope that
as the band
progresses, we
see more of
the originality
they’ve
shown us on
REDUXER.”
artists and producers like
Pusha T, Goldlink and
Danny Brown to name a
few.
The songs I liked from
RELAXER have only
been improved upon,
but it’s the previously
wishy-washy tracks that
really stand as testament
to alt-J’s ability to regroup
and rework. ‘Hit Me Like
That Snare’ is one of the
tracks that is remixed not
once but twice on this
album, chaotic and disso-
nant with Jimi Charles’s
passionate vocals in
the first but smooth and
funky with Rejjie Snow’s
laid back rapping in the
second. Each are much
better than Joe’s vocals
in the original. ‘Adeline’
was originally a standard
safe alt-J song but here it’s
been morphed into a chill
trap banger with an alt-J
twist (good name for a
cocktail?). If that doesn’t
entice you I don’t know
what will.
Though each song is
in that you can always
recognize the original.
The choruses are usually
kept, while the verses are
given to a feature. Filling
the verse space with a
rap feature eliminates the
watery and directionless
feeling the tracks had in
the original. All the while
a sweet brew of solid
beats and airy instrumen-
tals mix in the background
giving the album a unique
feel.
The album still has
its problems. I still hate
‘House of the Rising
Sun’, but it can’t be easy
to turn something that
bad into something good.
Also, the album lacks any
real direction or message.
But how much can you
expect from these artists
when they’re separately
remixing tracks of an
album they didn’t create.
REDUXER isn’t really a
proper album or a serious
project, it’s more just a bit
of fun (done well).
When the album was
dropped, Joe Newman
posted on Facebook
talking about how excited
they were to be working
with global hip-hop artists
who have influenced them
so much, and their passion
shines through. I would
love to see more music
like this from alt-J, and
while I’m not expecting
them to switch entirely
to hip-hop, I’d hope that
as the band progresses,
we see more of the orig-
inality they’ve shown us
on REDUXER. I’m truly
impressed by this miracle
transformation.
So while we wait
semi-tentatively for
whatever alt-J have
planned next, at least we
can sit back and enjoy
this delicious concoction
they’ve served us.
