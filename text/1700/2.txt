Felix 1700
T
his week's issue
of Felix is Issu
1700! Happy
Birthday (?)
Felix! In light of this
being Issue 1700, the
Felix team and I had a
lot of fun digging in the
archives this week. It's
fascinating to see how the
paper has evolved from
the hand-drawn front
covers of Issue 1 in 1949
to the behemoth of a paper
we have today. It's also
interesting to observe how
times and opinions have
changed over the years.
The centrefolds definitely
used to err on the wrong
side of creepy back in the
day and the classic "drunk
mate of the week" section
might just need to be
revived in the near future!
Featured in this week's
issue of Felix is a special
Felix 1700 centrefold
pullout, highlighting the
more eye-catching front
covers from the past 1699
issues. Music Editor,
Adrian LaMoury, has also
included a really interest-
ing article in the Music
section this week, detail-
ing some of the big name
artists that have graced the
Imperial College stage in
the past. From Pink Floyd
and Queen to Sir Elton
John and Fleetwood Mac,
Imperial really did used to
pull in the big names to
perform at Summer Ball.
It begs the question, "who
was last year's Summer
Ball headline act...?"
This week's horoscopes
also include throwback
adaptations of classic
horoscopes from the Felix
archives!
beaten my previous record
of writing my editorial at
10.30pm, as it is currently
11.37pm... a whole hour
and 37 minutes past the
print deadline. I don't
know how else to impress
upon you just how close
we come every week
to not actually having
a paper. If anything, I'll
just blame Turnitin (that
excuse worked for my
entire degree).
On a more personal
note, this week has been
pretty tough for me and
I would like to extend
my deepest gratitude to
all members of the Felix
editorial team for being
as amazing as usual and
making my job a thousand
times easier. I wouldn't

have even realised that
this week's issue was
Issue 1700 if it weren't for
the sharper members of
the editorial team pointin
it out.
You can probably
already tell, but I still
don't really know how to
write an editroial. There's
only so much waffling a
man can do. Think I'm
going to wrap this one up
here.
“Happy
Birthday (?)
Felix!”
Once again, despite
promising myself that this
week would be different,
I'm writing this editorial
late on a Thursday night,
as the print deadline edges
evercloser.Thisweek,I've
