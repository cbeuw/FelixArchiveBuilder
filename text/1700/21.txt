Mrs Dalloway Brought to the Stage
“The actors
are fantastic,
clearly the best
part of the
production”
“The overall
result is
something of
a mess, a flurry
of words that
doesn’t quite
take shape”
T
his adaptation of
Virginia Woolf’s
1925 novel is
clearly a labour
of love, and an ambitious
one at that. Mrs Dalloway
is one of Woolf’s best-
known works, and
arguably one of her best.
In 1920s London, Clarissa
Dalloway prepares to host
a party for her wealthy
friends. On the same day,
First World War veteran
Septimus Warren Smith is
urged by his wife to seek
helpforhispsychosisfrom
Sir William Bradshaw, a
wealthy doctor, and part
of the upper-class society
to which Clarissa belongs.
Although the events of
the novel take place over
a single summer day, it
encompasses a myriad
of characters and per-
spectives across different
locations, with references
to many events in the
Mrs Dalloway was also
deeply personal for
Virginia Woolf. Septimus’
post-traumatic stress, his
visions of his dead friend
Evans and the gradual
decline of his mental state
are widely believed to
echo Woolf’s own life.
Virginia Woolf herself
suffered from psychosis
and there is a hint of her
experience in Septimus
and his struggles.
Woolf crosses fre-
quently between the
characters, with as much
a focus on their thoughts
as their actions. And this
is one of the things that
is so difficult to translate
to the stage: the bulk of
the novel is taking place
in the characters’ heads.
Director Thomas Bailey
tries to capture this in his
adaptation – the actors
talk and interact with each
other, but then speak their
characters’ inner thoughts
into a dictaphone. It’s
quirky and it works, but
soon it starts feeling like
an overused gimmick.
There are other little
touches that seem to be
an attempt to be clever or
relevant, such as the use
of an Oyster Card to rep-
resent a ticket and a Metro
newspaper, but they don’t
seem to be part of any
uniting vision and just feel
like odd touches that add
nothing, and conversely
distract from what is hap-
pening. The final scene,
a party, is played out as
a press conference, with
the actors sitting in a line,
alternating characters. It’s
one of Thomas Bailey’s
best decisions with this
adaptation as it heightens
the feeling of absurdity
that pervades the scene.
One of the big draws of
Mrs Dalloway is Woolf’s
language, and playwright
Hal Coase’s adaptation
of the text maintains her
flair for the poetic and her
beautiful descriptions of
London. It’s a disappoint-
ment though that they are
merely words read out by
the actors and not repre-
sented on stage. The set
is minimal; a single blue
board serves as the only
backdrop for a great part
of the play. The bustle of
London, the grandeur of
Clarissa’s life – there’s too
much that this play asks
you to imagine for such
a visual medium. The
Arcola Theatre’s Stage 2
is also a tiny space, and
one that doesn’t suit this
production at all. Mrs
Dalloway needs distance
and magnitude. Instead
it feels cramped and
claustrophobic, the actors
crossing each other too
often – everything feels
too close.
The actors, however,
are fantastic, clearly the
best part of the production.
Their enthusiasm gives
you the sense that this is
a real passion project for
everyone involved. And
really, no cast could have
done better than those
chosen by Thomas Bailey.
Five actors play over
20 different characters,
but somehow manage to
capturetheessenceofeach
one. Claire Perkins is fan-
tastic as the titular charac-
ter, at points graceful and
charming as the perfect
hostess, but also capturing
Clarissa’s moments of
vulnerability. The real
stand-out performer
though is undoubtedly
Clare Lawrence Moody.
Her takes on Clarissa’s
charming old friend Sally
and the drab Mrs Kilman
are both excellent and
intense. When everyone is
on stage, it’s her that your
eyes are drawn to. That
isn’t to say that the rest
of the cast are weak – far
from it. Guy Rhys is a
convincing Septimus and
Emma D’arcy is great as
his distraught wife Rezia.
The overall result of
the play is something of a
mess,aflurryofwordsthat
doesn’t quite take shape.
The die-hard Virginia
Woolf fan will certainly
find things to appreciate,
but there’s not a great
deal here for the casual
viewer. Mrs Dalloway
just doesn’t translate well
to the stage. Hal Coase’s
writing isn’t bad, not by
a long shot, but it’s clear
this isn’t the medium for
Mrs Dalloway. Your time
would be better spent
picking up a copy of the
book.
