Wishing You an Appy New Year in London
This week in the Tech section, we are reviewing some essential apps we hope will enhance your experience of
living in London
W
hether you
are new
to London
or you’ve
always lived here, the
collecton of apps in this
article consists of apps
many Londoners use
daily, and many more you
may be unaware of. Either
way, they are sure to help
you out if you haven’t
used them before.
While you can definite-
ly get by reading Tube or
bus maps, if you want to
save some time, Citymap-
per is the way to go. The
app provides you with
live updates on buses and
Tube lines, and calculates
the fastest routes to any
destination.
Additionally, you
can see if there are any
Santander bike racks
nearby along with how
many bikes/free spaces
are available there.
Monzo is a smart
banking app, packed with
useful features to help you
manage your finances.
Once you open a current
account with Monzo, they
will send you a debit card,
and you can also set it up
on Apple or Android pay.
Any transaction carried
out with Monzo will be
automatically catego-
rized, for example, into
restaurants, shopping, or
groceries . This makes it
very easy to track your
spending without putting
in any effort.
Apart from being
user-friendly, Monzo is
also good for use abroad.
For cash withdrawals
from ATMs under £200 a
month, there are no fees.
Other spending can go
over that limit without any
charges.

doing this and tickets
can be purchased directly
through the app. Usually
the prices range from £5
to £10. Have a look and
you might find something
you’re interested in!
The aim of this app is
to make buying tickets
for festivals much easier.
Tickets can be refunded
and you are safe from
having to pay more than
you should.
Dice also offers recom-
mendations for upcoming
gigs if you feel like trying
something new. If you
allow it to access your
Apple Music or Spotify,
the app tailors its recom-
mendations to your music
taste.
Using your location,
Dice can also keep you
up-to-date on events hap-
pening in your area, such
as across the many clubs
in London.
For regular customers
at the various catering
outlets around campus,
YoYo is an app definitely
worth giving a go.
You have probably
heard the name if you’ve
ever bought lunch here.
YoYo is essentially a kind
of loyalty program.
If you pay for food via
YoYo, you will receive
points which can be
redeemed to get (for
example) fruit, chocolate
bars or even a smoothie
depending on how many
points you have.
Additionally, there are
loyalty cards on the app,
so, for example, your 10th
hot drink might be free.

If you are new to
London or even if you
have lived here a while,
public transport can be
complicated.
Do you ever see an
article you want to read
later, and then just never
come back to it? Instapa-
per allows you to save any
article you are reading,
and then it is downloaded
in the Instapaper app.
It’s great for catching up
on your reading during
long Tube journeys or
whenever you do feel like
it.
