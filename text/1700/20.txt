Who was the summer ball headliner again?
Minimum to maximum, ambient to aggressive
A
ggression has,
for the most
part, been a
matter of force
or damage. They yell,
the guitars scream, the
drums roar. All a product
of man’s basest tenden-
cies, a primitive release.
Reining it back, Live
2002, is in many ways a
controlled exploration of
the impulses preceding
the violence. Its pulsating
sine waves and pricking
clicks dig themselves
into its listener’s skull.
Scoring the ascent to
man’s breaking point,
narrating the build-up to
a night of transgressions
and misdeeds.
The early 2000s were
witness to a new era
of minimal electronic
music characterised by
a stripped back elec-
tronic sound and glitchy
textures. Spearheaded by
labels like Raster Noton,
the movement failed
to truly crystallise into
anything substantial, with
near misses we would see
in releases like Ikeda’s
Dataplex or Ripatti’s
Entain. Or so we thought.
A decade and a half later,
we have what could be
considered the scene’s
opus, performed live for
a residency in The Baltic
Centre For Contemporary
Art, all this while tucked
away in a dank corner

LIVE 2002
“A true work
of art and a
labour of love,
birthed from
spontaneity,
yet controlled,
measured, and
sinister”
somewhere.
Live 2002 blends
minimal techno, glitch
and microsound in a
truly gorgeous and yet
simultaneously unnerving
method. Over the course
of 11 movements, it
presents itself as a true
work of art and a labour of
love, birthed from spon-
taneity, yet controlled,
measured, and sinister.
