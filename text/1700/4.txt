Imperial hosts Muslim Student Panel
Inspiring Britain's young Muslims to embrace their faith as an integral part of their education
What is MSP?

S t u d e n t
P a n e l
(MSP) is
a campaign hosted by
Imperial College Union
in collaboration with 13
Islamic Societies across
the UK. It was formed in
order to support prospec-
tive university students in
their decisions in pursuing
higher education. Whilst
there is an abundance of
experienced and well-
planned panels available
to young students there
has not been one specifi-
cally for Muslim students.
The need for such an event
is that, whilst Muslim
students face the same
worries as their peers such
as personal statements, en-
trance exams and making
friends, there are also a
number of considerations
that emerge from a need
to ensure that they can
comfortably enrich their
faith throughout their uni-
versity experience. This
can include ensuring one
has the correct (Islamic)
intention, knowing how to
navigate the intricacies of
their religious obligations
whilst studying or perhaps
even advice on finding
common ground with their
ever-diverse peers. MSP
aimed to alleviate these
concerns by showcasing
some of the gems we have
in the Muslim academic
community by providing
them with a platform to
share their experiences
and impart some wisdom.
their prospective fields.
Nora Abdoun, a 4th year
Imperial Medical student
said, "speaking on the
panel was an absolute
honour. The students were
so eager to learn and I
couldn't help but think of
how much my younger
self would have benefited
from an event like this
throughout". Halima
Shah, a PhD student from
UCL, also had a positive
experience, shaing that
"being on the panel was
such an exciting and
rewarding experience,
I found it so beneficial
meeting the other panel-
lists and hearing about
their journeys and advice,
Alhumdullilah [praise be
to Allah]!". Pre-submitted
and live questions were
answered on a range of
topics from advice on
writing personal state-
ments to how to pray
when a lecture clashes
with prayer timings.
Congregational prayer
was performed, and
the day ended with the
opportunity to network
with students representing
a range of subjects and
degrees.
The event received
positive feedback; one
submitted said, "This was
a really good event and I'm
really glad that I attended
it. I have benefited both
spiritually and academi-
cally. It helped me make a
decision of what I actually
want to study and the
reason why. Jazakallah
khair [may Allah reward
you with goodness] for
organising I look forward
to attend[ing] more events
that you guys organise.
May Allah bless you all
who came yesterday".

The Launch of
MSP
MSP was held
at Imperial College
London on Saturday
6th October. Keynote
speakers included Ismaeel
Karmani, a current final
year EEE student, who
spoke about the impor-
tance of gaining an edu-
cation- which includes,
but is not limited to, the
typical school to Univer-
sity route. Ilyas Nagdee,
NUS BME officer, was
also invited to speak. He
touched upon the impor-
tance of representation
in higher education and
aimed to inspire attendees
to be the first in their field,
not shying away from
areas that lack diversity.
This was then followed by
a 7-membered panel fea-
turing students from LSE,
Keele, UCL, Portsmouth
and Imperial along with
some already working in

Imperial College Men's Rugby Club loses appeal
NEWS
The punishments for the February "Fiesta Dash" event, which involved public nudity, other indecent exposure and vulgar behaviour, will be upheld
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
O
n Wednesday
3rd
October, it
was revealed
that Imperial's
Men's Rugby Club
(ICURFC) had lost
its appeal against the
sanctions following its
February "Fiesta Dash"
event.
The sanctions, which
included all four ACC
Rugby teams being
banned from competing
in their first three league
(non-cup) matches of the
2018-19 academic year,
will be upheld following
the failed appeal.
As reported by Felix
in June, the 'Mexi-
can-themed' "Fiesta Dash"
event, which was held on
7th
February, quickly spi-
ralled out of control and
resulted in public nudity
and indecent exposure.
The club-sanctioned
event was organised by
club social secretaries
and approved by the
club captain. Video and
photographic evidence
which had been shared in
a WhatsApp group chat
were published in The Sun
in early June. The story
was then quickly picked
up by a number of other
national newspapers,
including The Telegraph
and Independent.
Students were captured
revealing themselves in
front of the Cenotaph,
climbing naked into foun-
tains in Trafalgar Square,
and making 'jokes' about
Mexicans and disabled
people. Photographs of
the students posing naked
in front of the Winston
Churchill statue in Par-
liament Square, covering
their genitals with
sombreros also emerged,
along with other pictures
of the team members
exposing themselves
outside the Royal Albert
Hall and downing bottles
of wine.
At the time, both the
College and Imperial
College Union described
the students' behaviour
as "completely unac-
ceptable" and the team
was suspended, pending
further investigation. The
subsequent hearing was
held on 20th
June and,
in addition to the afore-
mentioned punishment,
further sanctions were also
levelled against the club.
These include removal of
tour privileges until 31st
July 2020 and revocation
of the committee and
club captain’s authority
to make independent
financial and social event
decisions. All such deci-
sions must be ratified by
the Union President until
31st
July 2020.
In a statement given to
Felix in June on behalf
of the Union and the
College, a representative
said: “This alleged be-
haviour goes against the
values and expectations of
our student and staff com-
munity and is completely
unacceptable.”
The rugby club is
"deemed to have brought
the Union into disrepute"
and further videos showed
team members encourag-
ing eachother to defecate
in public. One student can
be seen exposing himself
on a public tube carriage,
whilst other videos show
the students making of-
fensive comments: in one,
a student in a sombrero
and poncho clambers
over a high wall, while
another shouts “typical
immigrant”. Another
video allegedly shows a
student trying to dance
with a disabled girl in
a nightclub; a comment
on the WhatsApp group
reads: “Poor girl can’t
even walk away.”
It should be noted that
the Rugby club was coop-
erative during the inves-
tigation. In June, a repre-
sentative of ICURFC told
Felix: “The rugby club are
deeply regretful about the
behaviour which occurred
in this incident and how it
reflects on the university
and members of the club.”
The event organisers
have been expelled from
representing the College
in any sporting compe-
tition, for any club with
BUCS membership until
31st
July 2019, while the
other individuals involved
have been suspended
from representing the
College, in any sporting
competition, for any club
with BUCS membership,
until 31st
July 2019. Any
breach of the sanctions
before 31st
July 2020
will automatically incur
a complete two-year
competitive ban for the
entire club, if the incident
in question is reported to
the Union by the club. If
the incident in question is
reported by anyone other
than ACC Rugby, the
club will incur a four year
complete suspension.
It is telling that, despite
the event occurring in
February, nobody in the
club thought it important
to call out this behaviour;
this suggests the need for
cultural reform within
ACC Rugby.

Future Prospects
Given the ever-growing
diversity of 21st Century
Britain and by extension
the landscape of higher
education, where religion
has become a prominent
aspect of many a student’s
identity, values and aspi-
rations, a panel with focus
on fusing ones religiously
informed ethos with their
academic and occupation-
al aspirations is likely to
be increasingly relevant
and impactful. The MSP
has the potential to go
beyond simply providing
insight into university
life and applications by
becoming a platform for
Muslim students across
the country to support
and engage prospective
students by allowing them
to embrace their faith
as an integral element
of what informs their
direction and, in doing
so, capitalising on the op-
portunities that come with
higher education. Be this
through focused work-
shops or through talks
tackling specific issues,
the MSP has a versatility
which will allow it to play
a pivotal role in not only
