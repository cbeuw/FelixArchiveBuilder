Is Kanye West going south?
Some call him the artist of the 21st centruy and some a self obsessed narcissist, but whether
you love him or hate him, he’s definitely here to stay.

N
ever far from
controversy,
Kanye West
(now wanting
to be known as Ye),
has hit headlines again,
provoking a lot of reaction
fromtheinternetfollowing
his appearance on the
44th season premiere of
Saturday Night Live last
week. Ye performed his
single “I love it” with
Lil Pump, as they danced
around on stage dressed
up as bottled water. Many
came to ridicule his set;
laughing at him and not
with him. At the finale of
the programme, Ye broke
into a passionate speech
about the Make America
Great Again hat he’s
wearing, liberal media
and having the freedom of
expression.
This is the man who
blurted out “George Bush
doesn’t care about black
people,” at a Hurricane
Katrina relief concert
back in 2005, much to
the shock of Chris Tucker
and Mike Myers, who
were co-presenting. He
does this to highlight the
negative media portrayal
of African Americans
affected by the Katrina
and suggesting that the
relief responses to black
peoples were unfair.While
this was early in Ye’s
journey into blooming
as the Kanye West he is
known as today, we see
that this man has no fear
of controversy—he is not
one to stand in line just
because everyone else is.
And to an extent he has
succeeded in what he set
out to do—Ye wants to
raise the issue of racism,
and he does so by making
a provocative statement
in the vein of clickbait,
which he himself knows
how ridiculous it is.
Perhaps his methods
are too extreme, as the
common reaction to
anything he does is anger
and mockery, but it’s
admirable for someone in
the public eye to go against
the grain. However,
we look back at Ye’s
comments in amusement,
as the gravitas of his
statement is survived by
memes focusing on the
absurdity of the situation.
Now fast track to this
earlier this year, when
he caused a tremendous
amount of backlash
with comments praising
Donald Trump and
about how slavery was
a “choice”. Many in
the African American
community were
outraged by Ye, forcing
him to apologise. This
is certainly a different
Kanye than in the example
before; this is Kanye the
satirical character, Kanye
the provocateur, Kanye
the absolute meme. It’s
clear he’s just chatting
a load of shit with the
safety net that he is Kanye
because he really doesn’t
care about what anyone
says. Why would he say
these awful things? What
is the point of pissing
off a lot of people at the
same time? Publicity, of
course, in the way that
only Ye knows how. 2018
has been a big year for Ye
so far, releasing several
singles, a solo self-titled
album and a collaborative
project with Pusha T
called ‘Kids See Ghosts’.
And coincidentally, all
his controversies arose
just before the releases
of new music—his latest
album ‘Yandhi’ was
planned to release during
the SNL performance,
but didn’t. What he is
doing is counterintuitive
but effective: the modern
world is a saturated place
full of all sorts of grey
detritus that people forget
about in times to come—
but if one says something
that goes against the
politics of a people, it
becomes something
that latches onto the
conscience of society as
a whole. What a weird
way to sell an album, is he
doing anything more than
that?WhatYe is ultimately
trying to achieve is to
imprint his mark on
the zeitgeist of today,
to transcend his rapper
status to something more
of a historical landmark.
So, in being angered by
his actions to go vent it
out on Twitter is exactly
what fuels Ye’s purpose.
He frequently compares
himself to Leonardo da
Vinci, Steve Jobs, Willy
Wonka, Shakespeare,
Google and many
more other culturally
important figures and
entities. It’s not entirely
preposterous to label him
as an artist of the 21st
century, representative
of the narcissism and
anti-conformism as a
consequence of social
media culture. Ye is one
of the most influential
African Americans alive
today and whether he
feels a he has duty to serve
as a spokesperson for
his heritage is a different
matter altogether.
He talks with a brio of a
messianic preacher, with
the lulling organ chords
of his song “Ghost Town”
in the backdrop. After
thanking God for this
platform, Ye sings “I feel
kinda free. I thought this
country said I could be
me.” Even though most
of what he said is generic
and mostly meaningless
tripe, the fact that it
provoked a reaction is
exactly what Ye set out
to do. This is the same
man who just performed
onstage dressed as a bottle
of Perrier water; it would
be a mistake to take this
man seriously. His tongue
is always firmly in his
cheek. I don’t even think
he likes Trump, or even
understands what he
represents. Ye went on
SNL because he craves
attention for the sake of it.
In the back of all this
is Ye’s mental health;
he implies that he has
bipolar disorder on the
album cover of Ye and
grappled with various
other issues throughout
his career. Obviously, this
must be considered when
assessing his actions—but
I don’t think it’s entirely
significant. Ye is just
doing what he feels is
right; there is no hidden
agenda as it all comes
from his heart. In truth, I
don’t even think he knows
what the hell he’s doing.
If you like Ye and the
stuff he does, then please
continue to live your life
peacefully. If you don’t,
there’s still no good reason
to get upset by him.

“The fact that
he can provoke
a reaction is
entirely what
Ye set out to
do”
If Trump embodies
the voice of the
disenfranchised right,
then Ye could be
considered an equal and
opposite, representing
the disenfranchised
left—using freedom of
thought and speech as a
counterargument to his
controversial comments.
He claims to have been
“bullied backstage” at
SNL for wearing the
MAGA hat and calls for
“debate not diatribe”
in the ongoing tussle
between the right and the
left in modern America.
In the closing moments of
the show, Ye talks about
how 90% of news, LA,
New York, writers and
rappers are liberal, and
how there’s no balance—
an almost Thanos-esque
statement, while saying
he can’t be told what to
do because when he puts
his “Superman cape” on.
