What on earth are you going to do this
Christmas
What are you going to do
this Christmas? When
everyone else is fighting
over the TV, e a t i n g ,
drinking and having family
tiffs, you could be making a
name for yourself. It is
quite easy — all you need
to do is write a short story,
aritcle or poem, or dash out
and take some photos or
do some drawings —
perhaps even a cartoon
strip. Then just send it to
the Phoenix Editor, c/o the
FELIX Office.
What is the Phoenix?
The Phoenix is the
l i t e r a r y a n d a r t i s t i c
magazine of Imperial
College. It was founded by
H G Wells and is now
produced annually. The
99th issue will be produced
in the spring term. Last
year, a prize of £30 was
given to the best entry. This
year there may also be a
prize for the best pictorial
entry.
This year's theme
The Phoenix is often
seen as an escape from
C o l l e g e l i f e b y i t s
contributors and readers.
As a result, science seems
to be a taboo. This is not
only a waste of subject
matter, but it is also very
sad.
Science is an inescap-
able part of human effort —
as m u c h as f a r m i n g ,
manufacturing, painting or
anything else that people
do. In the public eye,
scientists are seen as a
breed apart, not quite
human. But we are all
scientists here, and we
know that is not true. If we
cannot rejoice in our work,
then something is indeed
amiss.
The theme for this year's
Phoenix, then is science
and technology — science
and morality, science and
m a n k i n d , t h e h e r o i c
failures of science, the lost
secrets of ancient science,
conjectures about the
future, and of course
everything that comes
under the heading of
science fiction.
Most important of all is to
demonstrate the unity of
humanity and scientific
thought — one should not
be without the other.
So much for the theme —
I would especially like to
arrange all the articles
chronologically — past,
present future. But don't
feel forced to stick to my
guidelines — if there is
anything you feel strongly
about, do that.
Finally, if you would like
a copy of last year's
Phoenix, there are still a
few left in the Bookshop
and the FELIX Office, price
30p.
