Wellsoc
resignations
Three Wellsoc committee
members resigned this week
declaring themselves lacking
confidence in Chairman N J
Maxwell.
In their joint resignation letter
F Alii, Social Secretary, W
hooper, Vice Chairman, and D
Clements, Publicity Officer,
claim there has been 'consider-
able and increasing difficulty in
c o m m u n i c a t i n g w i t h the
Chairman. Sensible discussion is
now impossible, as opposing
views are repressed by the
Chairman, and occasionally
witheld from the minutes.
'We have come to the
conclusion that the society is
being mismanaged by the
Chairman, and that he is unable
to accept criticism or advice. A n
uncostitutional vendetta is being
conducted against certain
members of the committee.
Facing this unacceptableregeme,
we have no alternative but
reluctantly to quit our posts'.

About 80 people tried to enter the
Guilds meeting but the doors
were successfully blocked. A
telephone call was made to the
Chief Security Officer, Geoffry
Reeves, but he stressed that the
College do not get involved in
mascotry unless property is
damaged.
At 2.30pm, when a lecture was
scheduled to begin in M E 220,
C&E decided to attempt to leave.
By this time the number of people
outside had dropped to about 40
and Guilds had no trouble in
protecting their mascot, which
was driven away safely.

risque event organised annually
by the Royal School of Mines

involves strippers and films
portraying bondage, sadism,
masochism and bestiality.

Sherry drinking in the Union
Office has long been a standing
joke in F E L I X . Every Friday
afternoon and on other special
occasions (to celebrate another
inquorate U G M , for example)
the sherry is dished out to
assorted Union hacks and other
approved people. It's a sure sign
that you've fallen from favour to
be struck off Jen's sherry list. In
order to explain away this
apparent extravagance it has
always been said that the sherry is
a few bottles left over from the
annual Council Sherry Party, a
long standing event at which
members of the Union Council
and the College administration
are able to meet and mingle,
aided by the provision of snacks
and the ubiquitous sherry.
But a recent visit to the Deputy
President's office shortly after
this year's party took place last
week revealed no less than five
cases of 'left over' bottles of
sherry. Since this is at least as
much again as was actually
consumed at the party, at which
supplies were apparently limited,
any pretence that this is 'a few left
over bottles' just won't wash.
Excess supplies were quite clearly
ordered deliberately to enable
sufficient stocks to be Maid
down'. At a time when the Union
is faced with cutting back to the
tune of £6000 from all areas of
expenditure it's time those in the
Union Office put their own house
in order!
