SINGLES
Ray Parker Jnr: I still Can 'tGet
Over Loving You.
This is a re-release from last
y e a r , a n d is meant to
capitalize on the top-ten
success of Ghostbusters. This
has a classic ballad style,
however, and so will have a
c o m p l e t e l y different a u d -
ience. This is good though.
He's got an incredibly sexy
voice. I wish I could sing like
that.
Nick Heyward: Warning Sign
Anyone who got as sick as I
did with Blue Hat For A Blue
Day is sure to be pleased with
this change of direction for
the ex-Haircut sex-symbol.
His rap technique leaves a lot
to be desired, butthe music is
great. Lots of synth drums,
lots of guitar — top 20 at least.
Murray Head: One Night In
Bangkok
From the new musical by
Tim Rice, and the male half of
Abba, this is the first single.
After a very disjointed eastern
start, Murray breaks into a
f u n k y c h a t - r a p , w i t h a
stunningly catchy chorus If
you've made it this far, the rest
of the single is great. G o d
know how they'll incorporate
it into a musical though.
Huey Lewis And The News If
This Is It
W h o likes old-fashioned
bands like this anymore? But
hang on a minute, is this really
Huey Lewis I'm hearing on the
turntable? But this is a good
s o n g , with up to date
production, and great lyrics.
Really, is this Huey Lewis?
Maybe I should rethink my
musical biases.
Pointer Sisters: I'm so Excited
So, the music sticks in your
brain and you think you've
heard a good single, but isn't it
about time someone realised
what American crap like this is
doing to the British music
markets. Banal production,
with a naive lyric and three bar
tune — talk about Automatic
pop. The I C C C computer
could write more meaningful
music than this!
CINEMA
Refusal
There is a Film Society isn't
there? Well someone's been
putting t h e m to s h a m e
recently with a brilliant
repertoire of films. Only 50p a
time, every Thursday; some
jumble of letters— I C C N D ?
Last Thursday was no
exception with the black and
white film Refusal. It is a
moving story of an Austrian's
refusal to fight for Nazi
Germany, sticking to his
Catholic beliefs. The film
followed his lonely struggle to
die an insignificant death as
though he had never existed.
'Die like a peasant, like the
nothing he is.' He is achieving
nothing by his death. He is not
remembered.
The film has no music, and
produces a strongly pro-
gressive documentary effect
by breaking up scenes with
present day interviews with
the man's close friends and
other peasants from his
village. It ends with the words
from one man, aside his
tractor,
'What can you say?' There
will always be war, I am no
idealist, the film is worth
seeing. I didn't realise they
made them so good in those
days.
We left the theatre in
silence, leaving the pro-
jectionist alone. Just like the
man in the film, as insig-
nificant as each one of us.
Time Out l o a t h e h i m ,
Litererary Review love him,
The Sunday Telegraph have
not a clue but they wantto kiss
his ass anyway. The man is
Martin Amis and he can
WRITE. Dead Babies was re-
issued by Penguin this year.
The novel appears, at first
sight to be a black comedy
and little else. Amis has
created a group of awful
people, put them together in a
c o u n t r y h o u s e for t h e
weekend, and made odd
things happen to them. The
book is set (and was written)
in the mid seventies, and the
characters are, on the whole,
bored swingers who spend
their time trying to do
something outrageous which
they haven't tried already. The
options aje few, but they do
try.
The important theme is that
of control. The characters try
to control each other, but
Amis keeps writing little notes
to the reader to the effect that
HE is the boss, and he can
m a k e t h e s e s u c k e r s do
whatever he damn well likes.
The third set of controls are
applied by the precision
violence of 'The Conceptual-
ists' — requirements for
membership: a humanities
degree and a suit. These
s h a d y people are never
encountered, but the threat of
their presence underscores
the last parts of the book.
Amis has superb technique,
and style by the magnum. This
is a rare sort of book — a
readable masterpiece.
