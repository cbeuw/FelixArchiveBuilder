Victory at
last
On Wednesday IC recorded
their first win of the season in fine
style against the London School
fo - Economics. All the players
contributed to an impresive all
round team performance with,
tight marking at the back,
domination of the middle (with
excellent Hockey from Morris)
Hedges and Ian Parker and the
oppositions half, this was
especially evident during the first
half when both goals were scored
by Geoff Ares, the first coming
from a brilliant individual effort,
taking the ball into the D beating
the goal keeper and scoring with
a reverse stick flick the second
coming from a penalty flick.
In the second half IC
consolidated their position with
solid defending, they were
perhaps a little unlucky not to
score again with several
opportunites being foiled by the
opposition.
Thanks go to Alan from RSM
who switched teams at short
notice to make an invaluable
contribution.
Team: A Stewart, I Parker, M
Hedges, J Baxter, P Oliver, P
Smith, J West, G Ayres, P
Lufkin, Alan, K M Cormick and
P Dubenski.
IC 3rd XI—5 vs Harlow—1
The match started with a very
promising performance from the
whole team. After conceding an
early goal against the run of play,
Imperial received the necessary
motivation to take Harlow by
storm. A goal by Per Dullforce in
the first half enabled IC to arrive
at half time on level terms.
The second half then proved
to be an exhibition, or the IC
p l a y e r s d o m i n a t e d the
opposition. Excellent defending
by Mark, Craig and Chris with
good keeping by novice goalie
Alan Howard enabled IC to keep
a clean sheet in the 2nd half. At
the other end good interplay by
all the forwards allowed John
Sturgers to score four excellent
goals, bringing the final scoreline
to 5—1.
Team: A Howard, M Cubitt, C
Honey, I Mace, J Spencer, P
Dullforce, SBrooker,JSturgess,
C Harrison.
British Airways—2 IC 1st XI—3
A match which was expected to
be one of the hardest of the
season provided IC with their
first win in the Middlesex
League. Undoubtedly the most
spirited performance so far, and
this led to some good hockey
being played.
The forwards passed amongst
each other well, creating many
openings. J Baxter played well at
centre forward, acting as a target
man he slowed up the attack
until he had support. Also the
scorer of the third goal which
come after a sustained period of
attack from B A .
The half-backs worked hard
and had the better of the
opposition. Centre Half, POliver
scored the first goal a sole effort,
using close control to weave
through a maze of players and
eventually slip past the keeper.
The full-backs, although under
enourmous pressure during the
second half, coped manfully and
withstood the onslaught. T West
saved the ' match on several
occasions, notably in the dying
minutes from a well struck short
corner.
P Dubenski was the other
scorer, a good firm shot from the
edge of the D.
SNOOKER
Sweet
victory
IC—8 Tate & Lyle—4
'We woz robbed' — that phrase
neatly sums up the feeling in the
IC camp after producing what
w a s p r o b a b l y the best
performance of the season so far
to trounce a very competant
Tate and Lyle side only to finish
with an aggreate 50 point deficit.
This apparent anomaly arising
from the fact that some kindly
soul had blessed the visitors with
a very generous handicap.
Adrian Feasby, Ian Grindall,
and John West each won both of
their frames with Javed Qureshi
and captain, Mike Powell picking
up one each.
Unfortunately this being in the
handicap tournament the only
score of any importance is the
overall points difference. This
match leaves Imperial with a
points score of plus one in the
tournament so far and it seems
unfair that such a good win
should have produced such an
indifferent result.
HOCKEY
Mixed
Hockey
Superior tactics took the whole
team past four ticket collectors
in a mad dash to catch the train
at Waterloo, after starting from
Charing Cross! The late arrival
of St George's, the opposition,
did not deter the team, and after
a friendly match of variable play
(rugby, football, bits of hockey),
the game ended with a 4—0
victory for IC. Sergeant Pepper
(John Spencer) and Sandra Rofe
each scored a goal, Ian Howgate
scoring two.
Team: Philip Chaudhury, Alice
Banks, Ian Mace, Liz Clark, Ian
Howgate, Louise Wakeling,
Adam Hayell, Sergeant Pepper
(John Spencer), Sandra Rofe,
Angela Rowe, Duncan Wigney.
FOOTBALL
FELIX—
fast and
open game
Linstead Hall - Felix 2
Felix scored two excellent goals
last Sunday, in a fast and open
game against Linstead Hall.
Linstead, who had the wind in
their favour in the first half, tired
themselves quickly, while the
Felix pack saved their energies
for the second half.
Hero of the day was Rob Shiels
who hammered both the Felix
goals into the Linstead net from
40 yards.
The only casualty of the day
was Rowe, who retired clean for
an early mud-bath.
