It was pay up and trousers down
at IC Radio's flash rag stunt on
Monday.
Late night D J Hugh Southey
and station chief Pete Coleman
stripped to their microphones to
help raise £55 for Rag. 'What
pricks,' said an onlooker.
And two other students took
off one garment each for every
half a nicker given to Rag!
But the stunt took off when a
Linstead student revealed
everything but his name in Prince
Consort Road.
Finally Mech Eng fresher Paul
Merckx strode manfully naked
from IC Radio's Southside Sex
Centre to Linstead Hall! 'It was
freezing', he told F E L I X .
Hugh Southey said T only
played six records in my two hour
show, but I had no difficulty with
my equipment. I would do it
again to raise money'!!
F E L I X supremo Dave Rowe
added 'This sort of thing isn't
good enough'!!
Guilds
Funds
Freeze
City and Guilds Union may have
it's funds from I C U frozen, I C U
council decided on Monday.
Guilds had not replaced some
fireproofed parachutes belong-
ing to Linstead Hall that were
lost at last years Carnival.
Guilds were originally asked to
replace the parachutes at
Christmas, but sent n o n
f i r e p r o o f e d 'chutes. I C U
president, Ian Bull, proposed the
financial freeze, to begin next
month, to pressurise Guilds to
act. Mike Stuart, last years
G u i l d ' s President opposed
because he believed Linstead
were to blame for not telling
Guilds what they wanted. On a
vote the proposal was carried.
IC Union Council decided to
send two visitors to the N U S
Conference in B l a c k p o o l ,
