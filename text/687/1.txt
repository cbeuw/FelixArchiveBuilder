MINIMUM GRANT GOES
Chancellor slashes
student grants
Mr Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
announced a significant decrease in government funding of
student grants and tuition fees in the House of Commons on
Monday. The minimum grant, will be abolished from next
year. And for the first time, tuition fees will be charged to a
large number of parents. There will also be a tougher means
test for parental contributions.
The £205 minimum grant for
living expenses, currently
awarded to all degree students
regardless of parental income,
will be scrapped. In addition half
the parents with children in
higher education will have to pay
a proportion of their yearly
tuition fees up to £520. This will
be the first time since the advent
of the modern University system
that parents have been charged
tuition fees. The parental
contribution to maintenece
grants will also increase
substantially with increases
ranging from £57 for a family
income of £13,200 to £725 for an
income of £22,000. For parents
of a student living away from
home and studying in London
this will mean finding £2,625 a
year.
The changes do mean
however, that 10,000 low income
families will not pay anything to
send their children into higher
education.
Sir K e i t h J o s e p h , the
Education Secretary, who
announced the details of the cuts,
said that savings would amount
to £39 million. This money will
be spent on strengthening
research into science and
technology. He also thought that
changes would 'draw money
from the student group least
likely to be discouraged from
going into higher education'.

sit-in
Phil Woolas, president of the
National Union of Students
(NUS), has called for a national
24-hour occupation of all
Universities, Polytechnics and
Colleges next Wednesday, to
protest over the government cuts
in grants announced last
Monday.
M r Woolas and other N U S
officers are annoyed tht Sir Keith
Joseph, Secretary of State for
Education and Science, has
refused to speak to them for the
last three years.
Ian Bull, I C U President, said
he did not feel that such a sit-in at
Imperial could achieve any
change in the Governments
attitude.
T was shocked and dismayed
by the savagery of the annouced
cuts, of course, and I shall press
Lord Flowers to speak out
against them in the House of
Lords' said M r Bull.

Rent strike
A rent strike has been in progress
at Montpelier Hall since the
beginning of term. T h i s
postgraduate residence has been
without hot water and central
heating as new boilers were being
installed by contractors.
Laundry facilities have also been
severely restricted due to break-
downs and there are currently no
spin-driers in operation.
The 80 residents hope for a
rent rebate once the problems
have been overcome. Until then
they have decided not to pay any
rent at all.
The City and Guilds float taking part in the Lord Mayor's
parade last Saturday. The theme portrays the college's
centenary which is being celebrated this academic year.
