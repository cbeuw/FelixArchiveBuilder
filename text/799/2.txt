Just as I promised ten days ago—a
bumper edition of FELIX which will
take until the end of term to plough
through! We've got loads of features,
reports and letters, and the whole
thing took a very long time to put
together—so appreciate it.
My favourite bits in FELIX this
term have to include the features on
body language and courtship gestures.
This week we have featured
graphology as the centrespread. This
science is almost as fascinating as
observing people. Am I the only one
who has spent the last month watching
people making open crotch displays
at one another? Before I used to think
that particular people were
sexy/charming/charismatic but now I
just know that they can use their body
language to its full effect.
Graphology can also reveal more
about your character, although it is
a far cruder way of analysing your
friends. I spent the weekend
discovering that I am an egotist who
enjoys dominating others. But I knew
that already.
Quorum
In the last issue I was severely
restricted for space so I was unable
to write about the Results Union
General Meeting which took place
two weeks ago. I decided to sit to the
back of the meeting with the students
who were more interested in eating
their QT burgers than watching the
antics of various Union Officers. I
spent most of the meeting explaining
to curious observers what was
happening the other side of the room.
They were none the wiser. Procedure
is a hard thing to explain.
When the voting took place it was
clear that only about eighty people
were actually taking part in the
meeting. There were over three
hundred people in the room but the
meeting was clearly inquorate.
I am of the opinion that the idea of
taking the General Meetings into the
JCR hasn't worked—it hasn't
attracted any more people to the
Union and 'Quorum' has been abused
just as much in there as it was in the
Great Hall last year. At least in the
Great Hall you had a fair idea of who
was interested in the Union and how
it was run. Your voice could be heard
and everything was treated in a more
serious fashion than it has been this
year. I think that next year's UGM
Chairman should consider moving the
venue back to the Great Hall and sort
out some serious publicity for such
events. This year's has been abysmal.
While on the subject of the abuse
of the call of Quorum, I must say how
stupid and childish it was of our
President to call Quorum in the
middle of a Union General Meeting
just because the meeting was not
taking the direction he wanted.
Gambling
Should FELIX be encouraging
students to gamble their grants away?
This is a question that several people
have asked me recently. I think that
it is a harmless bit of fun because I
know when to stop. Unfortunately I
know of at least one student who is
in severe debt and still gambles.
Auntie Judi's advice is only gamble
if you can afford to lose your stake
and don't put bets on any of the horses
Paul Shanley recommends. Just
remember that it's only the bookies
who win.
Baron
Following the shock revelation last
issue that I was going to scrap the
Baron, there has been a flood of
protests. I am going to spend the next
three days conducting a straw poll
around College on the subject. If the
majority want to keep The Baron,
then it will be resurrected.
Controversy
My editorials seem to have caused a
great deal of controversy recently. I
even have lesser editors mentioning
them in their editorials. My 'election
results' editorial was written while I
was in an extremely cynical mood. I
still stand by what I said, because Mr
Goodwin distorted 'facts' in his
election material in order to win, I am
not alone in my feelings.
Print Unit
Due to the printer's oncoming
temporary nervous breakdown, the
Print Unit will be closed from today
for a month. I'll still be in the Office
over the Easter holidays if you need
any photocopying done, artwork
advice or technical process work
done.
Finally
Roll on the holidays, don't eat too
many Easter Eggs and get as much
revision done as you can. If you're
around College over the vacation,
drop by for a chat, and if you're in
Physics I can probably try to help you
with your problem sheets! Happy
Easter!
