• LINSTEAD and Tizard Halls of
Residence don't seem to be hitting it
off at the moment. Linstead
celebrated its birthday last week with
a party and a large message across the
windows of the hall reading 'Happy
Birthday Linstead'. This was soon
followed by a message on Tizard's
gallery level window saying 'We hate
Linstead'. Linstead retaliated by
invading Tizard and, in the process,
flooded a landing, removed all the
lavatory chains from one staircase and
pinched all the toilet paper in
Southside.
All wacky stuff, but my spies tell
me that it was not the residents of
Tizard who wrote the offending
message. It was, in fact, a subversive
Falmouth-Keogh group, known as
B*st*rdSoc, that has reaped havoc
around Southside for several weeks
now.
But why did Tizard not remove the
message when they saw what BSoc
had done? Answers on windows
please.
• MORE STORIES of wacky
goings on in the halls of residence
reached me this week. Apparently the
latest rage in one of the halls is
stealing people's door handles. A
more advanced version of this is to
unscrew the handle and take out the
bar connecting the inner and outer
handles and refit the handle. The lock,
therefore, looks untouched but is
rendered inoperative, trapping the
owner either inside or outside.
One unfortunate 'victim' of this
was a female postgraduate who had
her bar removed at midnight on
Saturday. She didn't discover it until
the next morning.
• WHO IS the Phantom Electrician
of the Union Building? This strange
poltergeist has been nicking the light
bulbs from the lift as fast as the Union
can replace them. STOIC Technical
Manager 'Axeman' Jon Denham
thought that he could get the better of
this ghost. He fitted a 200W bulb
which was so bright it gave lift
passengers a suntan, and so hot that
no mortal could have removed it.
However, the Phantom struck again,
and within two days the remains of
the bulb were seen scattered all over
level four of the Union Building.
• THE FUNNIEST thing to reach
my ears this week was the tale of the
IC Radio elections. A tough campaign
was fought between 'naughty' Nigel
Whitfield, final year chemist Richard
Fincher and Judith Hackney, who
needs something to do next year.
Richard was elected after the
reallocation of Judith's votes and
admitted that he was somewhat
surprised by the outcome. 'I voted
Judith 1 and me 2, actually,' he said
later!
• THERE WERE cheers in every
part of the College two weeks ago
when Syd Harbour Bridge (nee
Howgate) threw a tantrum and
withdrew from the race for UGM
Chairman when the Results U G M
decided not to let the new Constitution
and Policy Officer (CPO) through. He
seems to have taken the loss of his
chosen post next year to heart. He was
recently seen in the Bar shouting after
winner Paul 'Shan' Shanley, 'I'll be
watching you every step of the way
next year'.
My sources close to the great
Bridge tell me that he has contingency
plans. He believes that he will
definitely be the next subwarden of
Southwell House, Evelyn Gardens
when the post is advertised next term.
Why? Because great friend, and one
time presidential proposer, Ken
Young is the Warden there and has
promised him the job.
If this plan falls through, or even
if it doesn't, he will be watching for
any slips that Shan makes so that he
can 'No Confidence' him and
reinstate the CPO.
Mr Harbour Bridge has also
confided to his close friends that he
intends to run for a second term as
ICU President. Niggly Nigel Baker
is just 'keeping his seat warm'!
• IF MR SHB does stand for
President next year, he will certainly
have some stiff opposition. We've
only just got rid of this year's
sabbatical elections and potential
candidates for the 1989/90 session are
already making statements of intent.
Those in the running so far are Neil
McCluskey, current Recreational
Clubs Committee Chairman, who is
becoming increasingly vocal on all the
important Union committees he can
get himself on, also several Beans
Club candidates and a hamster. The
FELIX Office is running a bet on
whether SHB will manage a 'Ronald
Reagan' or just fade into obscurity.
•WHY IS THERE so much interest
in the drongo post of Union Publicity
Officer for next year? For the last few
years no-one has come forward to do
this thankless job, but there will be
as many as five candidates this year.
Is this because a certain well-known
ICU President made it clear that he
would stand for this post as a last
resort if he didn't get CPO?
• TOY BOY Paul 'Ego' Shanley has
been leading poor, impressionable
FELIX Editor Judith Hackney astray.
Every since he became a regular
fixture in the FELIX Office, she has
been seen drinking alcohol, betting on
the nags and indulging in indecent
interviewing techniques. Staff are
Libel
becoming increasingly concerned by
this abnormal behaviour and were
outraged to find the two watching the
Cheltenham Gold Cup on a television
in the FELIX Office especially
imported for the occasion last
Thursday. Miss Hackney, 22, denies
everything.
• FAILED HON SEC candidate
Rodger Houghton has gone into deep
depression since being defeated. He
has been sighted getting paralytic in
Southside Bar in the company of
several young ladies. This came to a
head last week when, after losing-his
glasses, he turned up at a house he no
longer resides in, wearing only one
shoe. Fellow residents at Lexham
Gardens have taken to calling him
'Cinderella'. But will Rodger ever
find his prince?
•WHAT DOES a warden do with
five free hours?
New Holbein Warden Chris
Toumazou might know. Recently he
decided to emulate his residents by
doing some serious sharking at a party
in Linstead Hall. He was cornered by
a fellow (female) warden and then
disappeared at midnight. He was next
seen when he interrupted a Holbein
all-night poker school at 5.00am. My
spies described his condition as 'well
under the influence, but well over the
• THAT'S ALL for now folks!
