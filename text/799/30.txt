IC Fifths win Cup
The victorious Fifths
The changing room was strangely
quiet. Everyone was simply sitting
there, gazing in disbelief at their
medals. No one at the club had
expected the victory, and it was
difficult for anyone to have even
accepted that the fifths had got to the
final, but we had won it...actually
won the Cup...
Normally, the laughter and chirpy
conversation would be ringing around
the dressing room; win or lose, it
never really mattered. Satisfaction
was derived from playing as a team,
for the team, and that was reward in
itself. No wonder it felt so odd to have
something tangible, to show our
grandchildren, as one cynical member
of the team pointed out.
It had been a long Cup run. When
we kicked off at King's College
Hospital all those months ago, no one
had the slightest image of the Cup in
their mind. We were without our
goalkeeper, but we were used to
setbacks. Jon Turner, almost
nonchalantly donned the green jersey,
and proceeded quite extraordinarily
to make a series of outstanding_saves.
We won 2-1, albeit with a goal by
Bassim Basma that could, and should
have been disallowed. Ironic perhaps
that this was our first victory of any
sort in the season. The Charing Cross
game was a different matter. 3-1 up
at half-time and, apparently, sailing
to victory. Yet, with seconds to go we
found ourselves 4-3 down. Quite
frankly, it felt like it was all over.
Then out of nowhere, Glenn Evans
popped up with a shot from over 35
yards, a dream goal, and we were still
alive after all. Penalties solved
nothing. In the replay, the IC defence
dominated everything. Cruising at
1-0, then CC&W equalised with a
goal in the last seconds; hand ball as
well. Fortune, we thought, had
deserted us. In the penalties, the most
consistent player, Mike Wilks,
normally so unruffled, missed his
kick. Yet again, as if merely trying
to unnerve us, Lady Luck returned;
CC&W missed twice, and Lee
Roberts calmly placed the winner to
grab his moment of glory. The
quarter-final beckoned.
This was without doubt the hardest
match, and for the script writers, they
chose a day when IC were at their
best. The tension at kick-off reached
new heights, but it was to be IC's day,
and Tanwir Ahmed's game. He
chased, tackled and barged like a man
knowing his destiny. Inimitably, he
crowned the performance with a
stunning goal. As if all this wasn't
enough, IC somehow let Royal Free
back into the game. We were not to
be denied though, and minutes from
the end, Pete Othen rose
magnificently to score the winner; a
choice occasion indeed for his only
goal of the season. At last, it seemed
that the team believed they could go
all the way. The semi-final can only
be described as being the most one-
sided match imaginable. Steve Von
Bargen marshalled his defence with
such remarkable ease that LSE never
looked like getting a shot on goal, let
alone scoring. Ian Charlton's flair
dominated the midfield. Yet IC
struggled to score and extra time
beckoned. The inevitable IC winner,
when it did arrive, was brilliant in its
own simplicity. Pete Othen's superbly
timed pass split the defence, and
Bassim Basma obliged with a delicate
chip, and IC fifths were now
dreaming of Motspur Park.
March 5th: IC's handful of
supporters almost seemed in awe of
UCL's coachload of fans. IC froze
right at the start, U C L scored, 1-0.
IC then took over. Mike Wilks stole
in to equalise, and U C L struggled to
put anything together. Then came
John Bolger's goal. He'd waited a
long time for this one, but when the
chance came, his sweet volley into the
corner was a delight, 2-1. U C L threw
everything at IC in the second half,
and a very dubious penalty allowed
them to equalise. But IC were not to
be denied. The ubiquitous Jon Turner
played out of his skin, ably assisted
by Basher Issa. Bah Tamanji's fresh
legs rejuvenated the attack, and in
extra-time the victory was sealed;
Glenn Evans' scorching shot
deserving to win any final, a stormer
of a goal; 3-2...perhaps it was no
wonder everyone was in a state of
shcok in the dressing room. This
strange mix of extrovert jokers had
actually won the Cup...
SAILING
A barrel of
fun
One of the most important events in
the Sailing Club calendar is the
Bradford Barrel, which this year took
place on March 11 to 13. Due to its
importance Friday night included a
weigh-in to sort out suitable
crew/helm combinations. For the
heavier members of the team this
meant stripping down to the boxer
shorts.
Sailing began early Saturday
morning, in Enterprises and Larks,
after a night of socialising with
members of the other ten teams, as
well as the compulsory Bradford
curry.
The first race of the day was against
our London rivals QMC. With some
bad timing at the start, IC looked set
to loose this grudge match. However,
eventually the Lark in second place
was one of IC's, giving a win with
2nd, 3rd and 4th positions.
Later, in the race against
Edinburgh, there was active team
racing before the start. One member
of the Edinburgh team in particular
was determined to take captain
Richard Jarman out, but in a
manoeuvre known as avoiding the
sharks, he managed to get away. This
meant another 2, 3, 4 win for IC.
Saturday night was again a riotous
social occasion, with team racing
tactics demonstrated in the night club.
This meant the early Sunday morning
start was hard for everyone except
Richard to cope with.
From Saturday's results, it emerged
that TCD was the team to beat. IC had
problems from the very beginning,
due to an unexpected change in start
time by the Bradford committee,
which was to TCD's advantage. Bill
rammed the start line buoy, and Sam
followed this up by banging him after
a few nasty gybes. Ape thought up the
brilliant tactic of gybing on to port,
unfortunately he colided with a boat
which appeared from nowhere. Final
result: 3, 5, 6.
Ape was again on form in the race
against Manchester, when he hit the
committee boat, started the race last,
but excelled himself by finishing first.
Apart from a win against Bradford,
the rest of the day proved
unsuccessful for IC. The Barrel was
finally won by TCD and the home
team Bradford, lost every race. Due
to the distance to travel home, we
were unable to see where we were
placed.
