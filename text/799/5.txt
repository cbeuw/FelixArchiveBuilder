Liaison
committee
set up
A liaison committee is to be set up to
provide better communications
between College administration and
the unions concerning Silwood Park.
At a meeting between College
Secretary John Smith and
representatives of all the staff unions,
the unions expressed their
apprehension about the new Science
Park and its staffing. ASTMS
spokesman John Fecamp told FELIX
yesterday that he was 'concerned that
a resource of the College was not
necessarily being put to the best use'.
Mr Fecamp is unhappy that the
Technology Transfer Centre is not
providing as much 'transfer of
thought' as he believes it should but
is instead being let out to private
companies to derive income.
Mr Smith told FELIX that College
was making around £100,000 each
year as clear profit from renting out
space in the Silwood Science Park
which was enabling more
development work to take place at
Silwood. He said that he saw the need
for more communication but that
'unions have no role' in the Science
Park. He is concerned that the
College unions don't appreciate that
the Science Park is business.
The new committee will have no
powers but it is hoped that all
concerned parties will be able to have
a say in what is happening in Silwood.
The IC Union President was also
invited to attend the meeting, and
although he didn't, it is hoped that
there will also be student
representatives on the new committee.
London
blackspot
The EEC should recognise London as
a 'priority area of economic and social
need'; according to a delegation
which arrived in Brussels on Monday.
The delegation comprises the leaders
of the fifteen labour boroughs and the
Inner London Education Authority.
Although London's areas of high
unemployment are amongst the worst
in the European Community, it is not
a designated development region as
are Belfast and Naples. The EEC has
funded training schemes as well as
investing several million pounds in
technology research funding in the
capital, so is likely to resist the
delegation's proposals for more
spending.
The proposals include special
measures to help the employment and
training of women and young people
with support for an expanded poverty
programme.
Tory row
A row about the sabbatical elections
at Kings College is still running, long
after most students have forgotten that
they ever took place. Five right-wing
Conservatives were disqualified for
allegedly forging three of their twenty
nominating signatures.
The Students' Union then began
disciplinary proceedings against the
tories, but none of them turned up to
the hearing which had to be
adjourned. The Union then sent
registered post letters to them but on
the second date the same thing
happened. The Disciplinary
Committee has now referred the
matter to the Principal.
The Blue Ox Babes played the Union Lounge last Friday to a small but
appreciative audience. The Babes have been receiving a great deal of press
coverage recently following the release of their latest single.
Merger
The Councils of the Central School
of Art and Design and St Martins
School of Art have decided to agree
to a merger despite bitter opposition
from both student unions.
Flood
The Union's Print Unit was severely
flooded over the weekend following
heavy overnight rainfalls. It was
estimated that around £100 worth of
paper was ruined.
