Community Action:
Your Questions
Answered...
What kind of people get involved
in Community Action?
Nothing could be more wrong than
the image of imposing sanctimonious
do-gooders interfering in other
people's lives. Everyone I have ever
met doing Community Action work,
both within ICCAG and outside, has
been friendly, thoughful and aware oi
their position. Ask them why they do
it, and they'll think, and after a short
pause, tell you that they enjoy it.
Community Action, and ICCAG,
is fun. Of course, not everybody is
attracted to the idea of Community
Work, but those that do tend to be
friendly and incredibly easy to get on
with. I was feeling at home with them
within minutes of joining my first
soup run. Part of it must be that there
is always lots to do; there is nothing
like a common project to bring people
together.
It is very difficult to write down just
what makes Community Work what
it is; you never know what it's like
until you've tried it.
What can I do to get involved?
The best way to get involved is to go
on a soup run. This is an experience
in itself, and you meet the most
unlikely of people sleeping rough.
Again it's something you will never
know about unless you go; you only
need to go once and, believe me, it's
a real surprise. Be prepared,
however, to discover as much about
your own attitudes as those of the
people you meet.
What do I get out of it?
Some of the community action
schemes involve training; so you may
acquire a new skill or two, but most
just get involved for the sake of it. It's
difficult to explain to someone who
has never been involved just what it
is like, and what makes you keep
coming back to it. What you get out
depends, I suppose, on what you put
in.
Does it take much time?
ICCAG is one of the few things you
can be involved in as little, or as
much, as you like. You can just take
one evening out to go on the Soup
Run, or commit yourself to work
every week for a year. The time you
put in is up to you.
Any more questions?
Get in contact with any ICCAG
member, or come along to one of the
meetings...
Who, Me?
IC Community Action Group (ICCAG) offer
the chance to every student to become
involved...
If you are interested, but haven't
this amount of time free, there does
exist a separate programme of 'one-
off jobs. These jobs are available
whenever you have the time (although
they ask you to do at least one every
three weeks).
As well as getting out of the IC 'rat
race', you get a chance to experience
the real world and learn some
invaluable skills into the bargain.
Contact ICCAG for more details
(while stocks last!).
Soup Run
The College Soup Run, at its simplest
level, exists to distribute soup, tea,
sandwiches and biscuits to homeless
people in London. It is much more
than that though: it is an opportunity
to see, understand and appreciate one
of the largest social problems in
London today—homelessness—and
an opportunity to help alleviate some
of the suffering and distress of those
who are homeless.
Not everyone who sleeps rough is
an alcoholic, dirty, rude old man.
Many of the poeple we meet and talk
to are well educated, once had good
jobs, homes and families but, for a
variety of reasons, ended up on the
streets. The reasons are as numerous
as the people: nervous breakdowns,
divorces, unemployment in their
original homes and their drift to
London to find work,' young people
turning away from home...
Once on the streets, it is nearly
impossible to get off them. Council
housing is rare; it's difficult to get a
job without a permanent address; it's
difficult to get togther enough money
to put a deposit on a private flat;
landlords are reluctant to rent to
people who look like they have been
sleeping rough.
The College soup run is not a large
commitment. It certainly doesn't
mean coming along every week. Just
come along once, to see a side of
London that most people would rather
ignore, but which certainly isn't going
to go away.
Rag Fete
ICCAG organises the hamburger/hot-
dog stall on the Queen's Lawn and all
proceeds go to Rag. Helpers are
needed beforehand to organise, help
and generally be about.
Crisis at Christmas
Every year an organisation called
Crisis at Christmas hires out a large
hall somewhere in London, and plays
host to up to 800 homeless men and
women for the week around
Christmas. They provide meals,
simple but comfortable sleeping
accommodation at night, new
clothing, hair cuts, medical attention
and perhaps more cheer and comfort
than would otherwise be had by those
homeless people at that time of year.
Crisis is a charity and depends on
volunteers to do everything, from
setting up the hall, doing the cooking,
serving meals, clearing up during the
'open' week and cleaning up
afterwards. It certainly makes a
difference to spend Christmas Day
serving dinner to 800 instead of the
usual family get-togethers at home— .
and the conversation tends to more
varied and interesting.
The 'open' is not the only activity
carried out by the charity Crisis.
Throughout the year they hold
fundraising events like sponsored
walks and they also support work in
hostels for the homeless, and for
rehabilitation. Open Christmasses do
not only happen just in London but
also in most of the other large cities
in Britain, so you don't have to be in
London over Christmas to be
involved.
Jobsquad
Jobsquad is run by Kensington Town
Hall for the local community, which,
believe it or not, does exist outside
Imperial, and ICCAG can put you in
touch with the relevant people.
If you're interested in teaching,
counselling, prison visting or similar,
there are about 20 schemes you can
take part in. Essential training is
provided free, so you aren't thrown
in the deep end, but you need to be
able to offer a regular commitment
(often once a week) for at least a year.
Playscheme
If you're interested in working with
5-10 year olds, both able bodied and
handicapped, there is a fortnighly
playgroup in Acton. Everything from
baking cakes to going swimming!
Hospital Visiting
ICCAG can put you in touch with St
Pancras Hospital if you are interested
in hospital visiting. After a short
interview at the Hospital, you can
spend as much or as little time as you
like visiting patients without relatives
of their own.
Travelling Funds
ICCAG are sometimes able to assist
with funds towards travelling for
students wishing to pursue
Community Action work on their own
initiative over the summer vacation.
Recently, they provided funds
enabling someone to travel to
Northern Ireland to help look after
handicapped children and give them
holidays out of the cities. Only limited
funds are available, however.
Contacts
Either pop a note in the IC Union
Office, or contact: Liz Warren (Chem
Eng 2), Alistair Goodall (DoC 1),
Kate Cox (DoC 1), or Margaret Poole
(Physics 2).
Alternatively, just turn up for the
Soup Run, which starts in Weeks Hall
Basement at 9.15pm tomorrow and
every Thursday, including over the
Easter break.
