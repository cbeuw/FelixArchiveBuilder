Vickers say No to planned
postgraduate only hall
The proposal to make Weeks Hall a
postgraduate only residence may have
to be shelved due to pressure from the
engineering company Vickers. As
reported in FELIX (793), Weeks Hall
was earmarked as a new postgraduate
only hall following a decision taken
at the College's Student Residence,
Committee (SRC). The use of Weeks
had to be subject to the agreement of
Vickers which provided money for its
construction. One of the conditions
made by the company was that all
Vickers' sponsored students would be
guaranteed places in the Hall. The
company, however, is unhappy with
the proposal and has told College
Assistant Secretary Michael Arthur
verbally that they are initally opposed
to the SRC's plan.
Mr Arthur told FELIX that he
hadn't 'got a definitive answer yet'
but that Vickers had given several
reasons why the proposal would not
be a good one. He said that they had
asked for more information, which he
had sent, but he had not received a
written reply.
Mr Arthur went on to say that if
Vickers did say no to the proposals
then the matter would have to be re-
discussed at the next SRC. He said
that the only other hall suitable to
become postgraduate only was one of
the Southside halls of residence. If
one of these was not accepted then the
idea of a new postgraduate hall would
have to be scrapped.
Union President Sydney Harbour
Bridge said that he was 'in a tricky
situation' because a Union General
Meeting had mandated him to resist
any moves to make any part of
Southside postgraduate only. He said
that he would take any new proposals
back to a UGM which could decide
to call a rent strike if College forced
a postgraduate hall on Southside.
Mr Arthur said that 'everybody
thought that it (the proposal for a
postgraduate only hall) was a good
idea but they didn't want it in their
hall'. It will be up to the Residents
Committee to decide on a final
proposal if Vickers should object to
using Weeks.
NUS threatened by MPs
An attempt by Tory back bench MPs
to force student unions to 'opt in' to
the National Union of Students,
instead of the present automatic
membership system, is unlikely to
succeed. Some 214 backbenchers
tabled an 'early day' motion
proposing the change, led by
Conservative Tim Janman, MP for
Thurrock.
The NUS, in fighting the motion,
claim that the NUS is not a closed
shop; student unions can and do vote
to join and leave, they say their
policies are decided by students at
their conferences, all of whom are
elected in cross-campus ballots.
The Government announced
yesterday that they would not be
adopting the clause and so it was only
tabled near the bottom of the order
paper, enabling any opponents to 'talk
the motion out'. As FELIX went to
press, the outcome was unknown.

UNION BUILDING
Mines results
The Royal School of Mines Union
(RSMU) elections for next year took
place yesterday with Tariq Abbas of
MRE 2 becoming RSMU President
for 1988/89. Vice President with the
largest majority was Eddie Gadd, also
MRE 2, and Nikki Deards (Mat 2)
was elected unopposed to Hon Sec.
The next Junior Treasurer will be
Ros Eden (Mt 2), and 88/89 Foreign
Students Officer is to be Neil Agble
(Mat 1).
ULU flop
Only one of the top three University
of London Union (ULU) sabbatical
posts was contested at the Annual
General Council (AGUC) last
Sunday.
Stewart Jackson, of Royal
Holloway and Bedford New College
(RHBNC) was returned unopposed
for 1988/89, as his opponent was not
properly registered as a student, and
Nicola Jones of University College
(UCL) was elected to Vice President
(Finance and Administration) without
opposition.
The only contested post was for
Vice President (Services), where
Louise Van der Straeten (UCL) beat
Grant Barden (RHBNC) by a large
margin.
The new President, Stewart
Jackson, promises in his manifesto,
to advertise ULU's services more
widely and he aims to 'popularise and
utilise ULU to change its image from
a bureaucratic students union without
students to a Union for all students'.
The returning officer told the
meeting that they had collectively
failed in encouraging people to come
forward and stand for ULU posts,
particularly the student
representatives on Senate—the top
body in the University. There are still
four senator posts left unfilled after
the meeting.
Books shelved
The Senate House library may be
made reference-only if plans by the
University of London are put into
action. The idea was put forward to
the library users as an idea to save the
library money. Librarians, however,
have warned that if all books are kept
in the building there will be no shelf
space left for new books.
Reading to
take degrees
Reading University has established
procedures to withdraw students'
degrees retrospectively. The
University claims that the measure
will improve freedom of speech, by
dissuading sabbatical officers from
'noisy demonstrations aimed at
preventing people from speaking'.
As an additional measure, a video
firm is hired to record student
protests. The University maintains
there are suspicions that the protests
are 'orchestrated by people outside
the University' and that the videos
will in fact protect genuine students.
The Student Union claims that last
year the University tried to delay
awarding sabbaticals' degrees until
the end of their term of office. After
the recent enactment of the Education
No 2 Act (1986), which involves
freedom of speech, the University
decided it could strip past students'
degrees; it claims all universities have
this right.
Rob Wilson, President of Reading
SU, described the actions as
'restricting the freedom of speech of
students'. He said that the Union has
a freedom of speech policy and will
not prevent anyone from speaking as
long as they speak within the law.
The Union is taking advice on a
legal petition to take to the Queen,
who is the Visitor of Reading
University.
