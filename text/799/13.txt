IC Rector in 'a Dead End Job'
Metaphysical Education
Lord William George Penney
(b. 1909)
Rector (1967-73)
Penney studied Maths at IC, returning
as an Assistant Professor at only 27
years old. In 1940, he started
scientific work with the Government,
largely involved with the effects of
explosions. With this experience he
went to America to work on the
Manhattan Project. He witnessed the
Alamogordo test and distinguished
himself at the Bikini Atoll tests where
he analysed the blast by its effect on
carefully arranged sea-water filled
petrol cans, while the more
sophisticated American monitoring
equipment was destroyed by the
explosion. Penney was an observer on
the Superfortress bomber that
delivered the Nagasaki bomb and this
experience made him determined to
safeguard British cities by developing
a British bomb as a deterent.

Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett,
Baron Blackett of Chelsea
(1897-1974)
Pro-Rector (1961-64) and Dean
(RCS) (1955-60)
Following his father into the Navy,
Blackett saw action in the Falklands
in 1914, and at Jutland, the principal
naval battle of the First World War
that gave the Royal Navy control of
the North Sea.
After the war, Blackett studied
physics at Cambridge under Lord
Rutherford, carrying out research on
improving Wilson's cloud chamber.
In 1933 while studying cosmic rays
he was able to confirm Anderson's
discovery of the positron (positive
electron). Much of his cosmic ray
penetration research was conducted
100 feet below London's pavements,
on a disused platform at Holborn
station. It was not until 1948 that
Blackett received the Nobel Prize for
his work in these fields.
McMahon Act, Penney was the
natural choice to lead the British
bomb programme. Despite persistent
staff shortages he was able to achieve
in six years, what had taken the
Soviets fourteen years and the
Americans seventeen years (though
obviously not quite a fair
comparison!) with Britian's first test
on the Monte Bello islands in 1952.
Followed by the H-bomb test on
Christmas Island in 1957—the
'Penney Banger'.
From the creation, in 1945, of the
UK Atomic Energy Authority Penney
was closely involved, and led the
inquiry into the fire at Windscale in
1957, of which the report was
recently made public under the thirty
year-rule.
Penney was Rector of IC from
1967-73, and on retiring described it
as 'A dead end job; there is nowhere
to go and at the end of it, you are
dead.'
In 1939, Blackett, as advisor to
Anti-Aircraft Command, helped in
reducing the number of rounds
required to bring down enemy aircraft
from 20,000 to 4,000. He was also
involved with tactical submarine
warfare, and RAF bomb sights. But
Blackett was a scientist with a strong
social conscience, as his controversial
paper the 'Military and Political
Consequences of Atomic Energy'
revealed. In this work he argued that
the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs
had been dropped for political reasons
and not, as President Truman had
claimed, 'to shorten the agony of
war'. At the time his views were held
as being pro-communist though they
are now accepted as platitudinous.
In 1953, he became Professor of
Physics at IC, pursuing research into
rock magnetism. He was honoured by
many institutions and received a life
peerage in 1969.
Richard Bunion Haldane, Viscount
Haldane of Cloan (1856-1928)
On committee responsible for
IC's Charter of Incorporation
Interestingly Haldane was not a
scientist; he studied philosophy and
later law at Edinburgh and Gottingen
Universities, he was a Liberal MP,
1885-1911, serving as War Minister
1905-12, and Lord Chancellor
1912-15 and again, in the first Labour
Government, in 1924. In his seven
years at the War Office he set up the
Expeditionary Force (later to play an
important part in the Great War), the
Territorial Army and the Officers'
Training Corps.
In early 1912, he visited Germany
in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the
naval arms race, this and his
otherwise close ties with Germany led
to pro-German accusations from the
sensationalist press. And in 1915 he
Lord Sherfield formerly
Sir Roger Makins (b 1904)
Chairman of the Governing Body
(1962-74)
After a brief career in law, Sherfield
entered the Foreign Office, in 1928,
serving in Washington, Oslo and
London. During the Second World
War, he acted as advisor to Lord
Swinton and later Harold Macmillan
in their work as Resident Minister to
Allied forces HQ, Algiers.
In 1945 he was posted to the British
Embassy, Washington and was
connected with the Tube Alloys
Project—part of the atomic bomb
programme—but was unable to
prevent the US from not sharing atom
secrets after the war.
Following a five-year spell at the
Foreign Office in London, Sherfield
returned to the United States as
was forced out of public life.
Haldane maintained an active
interest in higher education
throughout his life, founding the LSE
in 1895, and he was Birbeck College
president (1919-28). In 1904 he sat
on the committee that created the
University Grants Committee, and
later, the committee responsible for
IC's constitution.
In 1921, Haldane published a book
on the philosophical implications of
Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Later
that same year Einstein stayed with
Haldane while visiting England,
though he was sceptical of any moral
application of his theory, considering
it to be 'purely abstract-science'.
Haldane was not a particularly
popular figure, often clouding
political issues with his metaphysical
erudition.
ambassador. Throughout this time he
was invariably involved with atomic
energy, and it was, therefore, of little
surprise that he became Chairman of
the UK Atomic Energy Authority for
four years from 1959-63. He was
Chairman of IC's Governing Body
1962-74, being created Baron
Sherfield (after his home village
Sherfield-on-Loddon) in 1963.
More recently he chaired the Lord's
Select Committee on Science and
Technology in 1987, recommending
that Mrs Thatcher should appoint a
cabinet minister for Science and
Technology and chair a council on the
same subject.
In his prime, Sherfield was
described in the Financial Times as
'a tall gangling man who constantly
gesticulates with large hands'.
