Andrew Daglish,
Chunderer of the
Chesschequer,
outlines his plans
for the instant
revival of the
empire and
economy.
A government somewhere has been
radical, even revolutionary, but it lost
power because it was not
revolutionary enough and, trying to
prevent the completion of the
revolution, was crushed beneath the
overwhelming forces it had
unleashed. This fate is about to befall
another government somewhere else.
In order to spare the populace the
revolting task of having to scrape so
much politician jelly from beneath the
wheel of progress I now present my
economic masterpiece.
In essence it is quite simple. I will
introduce social ownership to the
Royal Mint. This privatisation will be
open to every man, woman and child
in the country, and one or two of the
more upwardly mobile cats and dogs
(puppies) too. Companies, institutions
and anyone or anything else will not,
repeat not, as in categorically banned,
be able to take advantage of this once-
in-a-lifetime offer. Not unless they
offer me something I want (are you
listening, Aston Martin? A flame-red
Vantage Volante with tan hide
upholstery would do nicely, thank
you). Money will not be something
I want, as you will come to see.
Why should this be so
advantageous to Mr and Mrs Joe and
Josephine Public? What do they get
for their money? And how much will
that be?
As I have said, it is quite simple.
For the price of a printing press, plus
VAT, postage and packing, they will
receive a printing press, instructions
for use, plus plates of all current Bank
of England notes. And before socialist
parties of the world start trying to
verbally castrate me because Joe and
Josephine don't have the ready cash
for a brand spanking (listening,
Sydney?) new, all singing, all dancing
printing press (currently in the order
of £ 1 0 million, excluding V A T ,
postage and packing), I am offering
easy terms.
For a deposit of just £5 they (Joe
and Josephine that is, not necessarily
the socialist parties) will receive their
new toy. The difference is payable on
commencement of printing. What
could be fairer?
"How will this effect the immediate
recovery of the (or indeed any)
economy?" I hear you cry (I've got
very good hearing).
I think there are about 56 million
people in a certain country.
Admittedly, I haven't met them all,
so I can't swear by this figure (well
I could, but it would be asterisked out)
but as a lot of other people whom I
have met also believe there are that
many people in a country then I am
going to publish and be * * * * * * ,
although we could be talking about a
different countries.
So, having arrived at the
conclusion, though not having
rigorously proved it, that there are 56
million people in a country and also
that most of them, -say about 560
million, are going to want to take
advantage of the offer, this means that
there is going to be one heck of a
demand for these super-duper printing
presses.
Not only that, but these have to be
delivered, requiring rather more
articulated lorries than currendy exist
on an utterly insignificant little blue-
green planet orbiting a small yellow
sun in the uncharted backwaters of the
Galaxy at a distance of roughly
ninety-two million miles (or more
accurately, 92.6 million). (Thank
you, Douglas).
Further, all 5600 million of them
(allowing for multiple applications
which will not be turned down) have
to be installed, which will of course
account for the working lives of
everyone/thing (not wishing to be
speciesist) qualified to do so, and
many of those who are not, for rather
a lot of generations to come,
especially if they get themselves
organised into a union and work to
rule.
In addition, the roads to convey the
vehicles at a sufficiently rapid rate
have to be constructed, as do
buildings in which to install the
presses (it should be pointed out that
these things cannot be shoved in the
wash house/utility room, or even in
your average, or not so, two-up, two-
down), which will in turn tie up most
of the world's construction trade for
most of the next two or so major
civilisations.
The following industries will also
be major beneficiaries of the offer:
a) The chemicals industry. They
will have to supply the inks and dyes
to print the notes. This should result
in (i) this industry in this random
country becoming the biggest in the
world (ii) lonely housewives/
husbands getting their daily quotas
from inkmen.
b) Forestry and the white paper
recycling industry. The latter on its
own has shown its inability to cope
with such demand following its lack
of success in achieving greater than
150% yields on full scale operations.
Hence we're going to have to plant
lots more trees! Unfortunately, we're
also going to have to cut them all
down again. Ah, well, you win some,
you lose some.
c) The power supply. Depending on
where the recipients live, these will
be the coal board, the CEGB, British
Gas, BNF, SHE, your local whippet
breeder or Hot Air Corp Inc (for
residents in the vicinity of the seat of
government only). This offer will
provide unparallelled opportunities
for research, development and sheer
exploitation of the customer in these
industries.
However, these will not be the only
lucky winners. Just think of all the fun
truck manufacturers will have as
people move away from mere wallets!
And what about safe-makers (and
breakers) and bodyguard (and assault-
troop) agencies? The possibilities are
endless.
So much for economics, although
these will sneak into the next section
just a teeny-weeny whacking great
bit. Having appealed to and satisfied
the socialist-capitalist in you all (I'm
one * * * * of a guy, and modest with
it), and having in the process, created
a uniformly rich and class-free
society, I now wish to appeal to the
patriotism of you random dwellers in
a country somewhere.
I wish, nay, want to create the
greatest empire in history as I
(admittedly slightly biasedly) know it.
But unlike previous emperors I do not
want the lives of your sons and
daughters. I just want some (and not
a lot at that) of your new-found
wealth.
You see, it all gets down to other
countries' money-supply. Basically,
we under-cut them. We can supply
them with money cheaper than
anyone else, on condition that they
only use ours. Of course we can then
flood their economies and destabilize
their governments and Bingo! one
world-wide empire.
