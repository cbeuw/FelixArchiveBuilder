Most fun are the loons, who
suggest, totally seriously, that
the whole IC Union grant should
be put on the 2.30 at
Newmarket. Ninety minutes later
you escape, swearing at the God
of Admissions Tutors—how do
these people get in ? Conclusive
proof that common sense and
intelligence are completely
unrelated.

Spring—that time
of year when right-
minded hacks of all
descriptions survey
the sabbatical
horizon and think
about their job next
year, and that
means—Elections.

Watch out for the guy in Beit,
who doesn't answer a knock at
his door, and when you pop a
leaflet into his room, opens the
door about an inch, and throws
your screwed up leaflet across
the corridor. The door then
slams. Obviously a quick
reader, he has decided that it is
all a load of crap and takes the
appropriate action. ^ ^
FELIX
Most important is to convince
yourself that you actually want to do
the job—and not just win the election.
Ability isn't important at this stage.
More excitement was added this year
when in January the goalposts were
moved at lightening speed: the
sabbatical job descriptions were
changed while ICU Council
collectively yawned.
Once you've found out what the job
will be (or, in some cases, have
written it yourself), you're all set.
There then follows the crucial 'run-
up', when the plan is to 'build your
image'. There are two orthodox
methods—either the 'blanket' system:
'my name was in FELIX fourteen
times last week', or the more selective
T saved IC Union £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 by
recycling hot air' credibility. Avoid,
at all costs any admission that you are
even thinking about contemplating
writing to your Auntie telling her you
might be standing. This is the kiss of
death.
The fun really starts when the
papers go up on the noticeboard for
the candidates. Again, there are two
schools of thought. The first 'cocky
bastard' method is to slap your name
down within thirty seconds of the final
drawing pin being pushed in, then get
your proposer and twenty seconders
queueing behind you. This
'blitzkrieg' technique is calculated to
give you a psychological advantage
over the opposition, lesser candidates,
as the theory goes, scurry back to the
woodwork. It had an added bonus this
year, as the papers were arranged so
that only the top ones were visible,
and your name was the only one
people saw when rushing for the
Norman's queue.
The other method is the 'late
rush'—lull the opponents into a false
sense of security, then rush at the
paper with your crowd just before the
papers are down. With luck and the
right rumours, you can leave your
opponent flat-footed, with no
publicity and no campaign, after two
weeks of thinking they wouldn't even
have an election.
Publicity is your next headache.
You have to negotiate a FELIX Office
full of sabbatical wanna-bes, all
convinced that they should have the
office to themselves. This isn't
possible, as you need it all yourself.
As well as negotiating with a tired and
increasingly emotional FELIX Editor,
you also have to contend with tired
and increasingly emotional FELIX
equipment (it's part of the service
contract that every bit must break
down at least twice in election week).
You also have to think of a witty
slogan—something that will still be
witty after a week's campaigning and
plastering on every available brick in
College. A silly gimmick is also
useful—silly haircuts or hats are a
definite plus. Anything to get the
electorate to remember your name.
You also have to get your publicity
approved by the all-powerful elections
committee. This consists of a group
of normally harmless randoms, who,
for two weeks, have the power of life
and death over all the candidates. It's
amazing, like putting someone behind
the wheel of a car. The most innocent
insubstantial nobody suddenly
becomes a power-crazed ego-maniac.
They may only get this one chance at
authority, and they're damned well
going to use it. Pity the candidate that
buys a packet of drawing pins without
checking with them first. It's not even
enough, sometimes, to get one of
them to agree—the others may have
another view. Apparently it's not
even enough to get them all to
agree—they change their minds later
that afternoon. As I said, they're
damned well going for it.
OK, so papers come down, you
have reams of posters and handouts,
pockets full of blu-tak, and have
concealed all your irregularities from
the authorities. All you do now is sell
yourself to the punters. The problem
with this is that they're not interested.
The average student's attention span
on anything non-alcoholic is about ten
seconds—just enough time to say,
'Hi, I'm Margaret Thatcher, I'm
standing in the sabbatical ele...' when
they walk away, probably wondering
what a sabbatical is.
Knocking on hall doors is fun—just
walk in, take no notice of the couple
disentangling themselves from each
another on the bed, and give them a
handout. Two votes in the bag.
Hustings is the time when you get
a chance to speak to the masses(?).
Stunts usually aren't a good idea,
unless you can pack the house with
your supporters. The idea is,
obviously, to rubbish your opposition
and look great yourself. However, it's
said you can never win at a
hustings—only lose one. Keep your
head and don't, whatever you do,
show anything of your true character.
You'll get torn to pieces. At hustings
you are 'Mr/Ms Nice Guy' and
nothing else.
The questions are OK, as long as
you aren't asked them first. This is
because the Public Address is so loud
that you could probably hear the
questions in the Union Building,
never mind the corridor off the Great
Hall (where you're put so that you
can't hear the questions). Going last
is even better as you hear all the other
candidates' answers as well. This
especially helps on relevant questions
such as 'What is 1037 minus 649'.
That is the other feature of hustings,
the asking of completely irrelevant
questions like this to, I'm told, 'bring
out your character'. Who are they
kidding?
Come election day, you're either
up, or you ain't, or you can't be
bothered anymore anyway. One
redeeming feature of IC elections,
must be their complete
unpredictability. It seems the average
voter only decides who to vote for
about ten seconds after they leave the
ballot box. Complete outsiders, who
have all but given up, have been
known to be elected by landslides.
There has never been any proof that
a good campaign every got any votes,
so you're in with a chance right up
to the finish post.
Once the big day arrives, there's
nothing for it but to get completely
smashed out of your brains! Being
sober is no good if you lose, and you
can't stay sober that long if you win.
It's not very clear what's worse-
winning or losing. It's great to win
the election, but then you have to do
the job...or you could always
resign...and then there'll be another
election.
You enjoyed it so much, you might
even stand again!
