The demise of Bauhaus and The
Sisters of Mercy all those years ago
left the serious aspect of the darker
side of rock without a champion. The
Cult briefly filled the gap, but when
Ian Astbury's worse heavy metal
infatuations took over, disillusioned
fans turned to the half of the Sisters
which had become The Mission, who
continue to ride on this wave with no
major challengers (Gene loves who?).
They play the Astoria until Sunday,
so make the most of the fact that this
venue is small (and cheap) enough for
you to fully appreciate the music. The
latest challenger to the crown of the
gothic world is one-time holder of that
crown, Peter Murphy, ex-Bauhaus
head vampire who launches his solo
career at the Sadler's Wells on
Sunday.
Gigs to look out for over Easter?
Well, from the harmless world of
pop, Simply Red are playing
Wembley Arena until Friday, T'pau
fill Hammersmith Odeon from March
31 to April 2, and Lloyd Cole and the
Commotions do the same to Wembley
Arena on April 17. Rockheads should
have a good time if they have the
money, with Magnum on Friday and
Saturday at Hammy Odeon, and
Wembley being ripped apart by Alice
Cooper on April 7, Def Leppard on
April 11 and 12, AC/DC on April 13
and Frank Zappa on April 18 and 19.
Yet more from Hammy Odeon with
Hawkwind on April 21 and 22.
Albums to seek and buy: Out last
week is the first solo offering from
Morrissey, 'Viva Hate', which isn't
too far removed from a certain band
named after Patty Smith, though some
say with added sparkle. The second
album from James, the jangly folk
indie affair who have been alikened
to The Smiths but actually sound
nothing like them (must have
something to do with being from
Manchester and on Rough Trade), but
Morrissey loves them and what
greater recommendation can I offer?
Number three from That Petrol
Emotion, Irish rockers whose every
new piece of material sounds
excitingly fresh, should be on the
shelves in the coming weeks. And a
must for all music lovers must be the
long awaited Primitives album—was
it really only a year ago that they were
Mary Chain-esque psychedelic
thrash?
