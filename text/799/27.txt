Waiting for Godot
(National Theatre)
Samual Beckett's Waiting for Godot
was written in 1949 but not seen in
Britain until six years later. In the
subsequent years many different
interpretations of the play have been
suggested: waiting for the second
coming of Christ; the futility of life;
occupied France in the Second World
War, to name but a few, it is,
however, without doubt an
astounding piece of Absurdist drama.
Michael Rudman's production at
the National builds wonderfully upon
the relationship of Vladimir and
Estragon, the two tramps that just
wait. We see Vladimir (Alex
McCowen) portrayed as a mildly
eccentric, wayward relation, who is
optimistic, confident and certainly
lovable. He twists and plays with the
conversation to pass the time, often
oblivious as to whether his scared and
pitiful companion, Estragon, is
joining in. John Alderton's Estragon
is a disabilitatingly nervous crack-pot,
who's life has been narrowed down
to here and to now. He has no
knowledge of what he did yesterday
or the day before, except that he was
beaten again, but at times he just
floats—a peaceful and happy escape
from reality.
As this relationship grows we see
the angst between these two unequal
characters living in their shared
environment. Estragon's glee at any
and all manifestation of Vladimir's
incontinence, his desperate need of
something with which to fill his days
and his double-sided faith in Vladimir
to provide this. We find ourselves
laughing with these tramps, enjoying
the rhetoric, but the arrival of Pozzo
and his servant, Lucky, over the
delightful rough hemp set, causes the
step to falter.
Pozzo (Terence Rigby) is loud,
brash (a little to so, in my opinion)
and sure of himself (with more than
a passing resemblance to the
National's Sir Peter Hall), whereas
Lucky is a tired old servant, who
doesn't speak and moves in the
minimalistic fashion. The change
when he enters into his speech, is
sudden and sharp. Peter Wight's
portrayal of Lucky's speech is
unusually slow with pauses that could
almost be mistaken for thoughtful!
Unfortunately the repetitive nature of
the interuptions by Vladimir and
Estragon (all given too much time)
produces an absurd, rather than
'absurdist' piece of drama.

Morrisey-'Vive Hate'
Morrissey has joined with producer
Stephen Street, who also wrote the
music, for his first non-Smiths album.
Stephen Street will inevitably be
compared to Johnny Marr, and
unfavourably by many. I think that the
music has a quality very similar to
that expressed in the words of the
songs.
Morrissey's view of England today
reflects a country where people
hopelessly yearn for qualities they can
never possess, and those who have
success are used then forgotten.
Margaret on the Guillotine illustrates
who he considers responsible and
what their fate should be.
A wistful elegance pervades this
whole record being most evident in
Late Night, Maudlin Street and Every
Day is Like Sunday. This could be
considered a catalogue of whingeing
from the the master of despair himself
but I feel that would just be a blind

The Enigma of Arrival
by V S Naipal (Penguin £3.95)
V S Naipal is an Indian, born in
Trinidad, who came to England
during the fifties. In The Enigma of
Arrival he compares to his
development as a writer with the
changing aspects of England. Naipal
can take the most ordinary and
everyday happenings and relate them
to his journey from birthplace to
adopted country. This book is
described as an important and
powerful novel by one of the greatest
novelists of our time.
The Green Man
The difference between absurd
drama and absurdist drama obviously
makes or breaks the production and
Michael Rudman has been very
careful to keep on the right side of the
line (most of the time). He succeeds
mainly because of two such strong
performances by Messrs Alderton and
McCowen, both of whom excel in
their roles and also because Waiting
for Godot is such a superb play.

by Kingsley Amis
The Green Man is a pub, and Maurice
Allington is the publican. He is an
alcoholic with a beautiful young wife
and a stunning young mistress. He is
also haunted by the spirit of Dr
Thomas Underhill who died in the
seventeenth century.
I started reading The Green Man
thinking I would definitely not enjoy
it: I normally prefer realistic subjects
and I do not believe in ghosts.
However I was not prepared for
Kingsley Amis' uncanny knack for
writing. His control of the English
language makes the character of
Maurice Allington a very true one,
one that the reader can believe in and
find very funny. This means there is
no surprise when he casually comes
across a ghost or two wandering
around the pub. It is also very
frightening. The fear arises as the
other characters react to the alcoholic
who is convinced he has seen a ghost
as normal: cut back on the whisky;
but we know it's not the drink, we
know it really is a ghost, just that no
one will believe it is.
Kingsley Amis keeps up an
excellent balance for fear and humour
throughout the book, making The
Green Man a very fine novel indeed.

The Fall
the FRENZ Experiment
The Fall are probably the only band
who could get away with releasing
this record with its dead Northern
vocals and rambling guitar/keyboard
backing. However in a world of Rick
Astleys and Tiffanys with their sterile,
mushy, overproduced crap the Fall
are monumental. Mark E Smith's
humour runs riot with tracks like
Frenz, Oswald Defence Lawyer, and
Guest Informant. If you hate the fall
this record isn't for you; 'The
miserable Scottish hotel resembled a
1970s Marillion or Genesis LP cover'
is a line that will probably make your
blood boil and cause you to rave about
their lack of skill (instrumentally and
vocally).
But if you count your friends on the
fingers of one hand buy this record
and increase your frenz.

The Rhythm Sisters are two identical
looking sisters from Leeds. They sing
in harmony over a single acoustic
guitar which has the disadvantage that
all their songs sound very similar.
Overall the effect was just grating and
monotonous. An album Road to
Roundbay Pier is available.
Next on stage were the James
Taylor Quartet, looking at these four
men you could be excused for
wondering what the fuss was about.
They play instrumental tunes from
60s film/TV series such as 'Mission
Impossible' and 'Blowup', which
conjures up a really frenetic
atmosphere. They headline at the
Town & Country Club on March 26,
and I can't think of a better reason to
part with five pounds.
Voice of the Beehive are just frills
and whirling dresses, try to touch
them and you find nothing there.
They play a mix of 50s-80s Rock and
Rock of the same brand as the B-52s
and the Bangles.
This was a good performance for
the fans and I did quite enjoy it,
except for the inane introductions they
feel we need to appreciate their songs.
A final niggle, this gig finished at
10.30pm which I found ludicrously
early.
