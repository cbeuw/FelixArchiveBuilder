Six months
of a
lifetime
As those who know me well will
realise, 1 have now spent the last six
months working full time for
Norman's, the Union Snack Bar. I
had a slack moment the other day,
during which I had a mental play with
some figures; the results quite
surprised me. The figures in question
relate to my use of time in those six
months, and here they are:
I estimate that I have made in
excess of twenty thousand cups of
coffee. This would have used enough
cups to make a stack three hundred
metres high, weighing twenty
kilogrammes. In making those cups,
I clocked up a total of more than a
hundred kilometres just walking from
the till to the coffee machine and
back, and used about three hundred
pounds weight of coffee granules.
I have made about five thousand
cups of tea, adding seventy-five
metres to the stack of cups and twenty
kilometres to my walking total.
I have smoked—arrgh—six
thousand cigarettes, shouted at
Norman Jardine two hundred times,
and had a furious row with Captain
Braincell. I have spent a total of four
and a half hours arguing with Simon
Bosher about gay rights, worn
provocative tee-shirts, and leched at
most of the Life Sciences department,
including one member of staff.
I have emerged with a great liking
for the raving Jock ned who runs the
place, and guess what? I'd do it all
again.
See you all soon,

Flash
Last October I was dragged along to
the Gate Theatre in Notting Hill Gate
to see a new comedy trio curiously
named Flash Haddock. After
appearing in numerous Electrical
Engineering revues and Beit Hall
parties I was assured they were worth
a try. The show was a huge success;
although their acting was useless, the
material was well thought out and the
audience were behind them all the
way.
On the strength of their success that
night, Flash Haddock were contracted
to appear at the Gate in February this
year and my curiosity forced me to
find out how they had progressed.
The change was very noticeable. The
script, as before, was hilarious but
now they could act. No longer were
in the
they just an unprofessional comedy
trio hoping for a break in the
entertainments world, they showed
authenticity and professionalism.
Enticed by the odd name and their
fantastic scriptwriting I chatted to
them recently about their work in
comedy revue.
Flash Haddock are not a wacky
band of surrealists. 'Don't even
mention the words wacky or zany in
this,' they said 'that's just the kind of
humour we're not'. So I did. The
three present members of Flash
Haddock, Josh (James O'Shea),
Douglas Earl andMalcolm Busby are
all ex-IC students from Electrical
Engineering. Directed by Ashid
Hilne, they have just finished a three
week stint at the Gate Theatre and

three weeks at the Canal Cafe
Theatre, Little Venice and are
currently writing material for News
Review, the largest running revue
show in London. They have been
hailed as 'the best new scriptwriters
in years', by Ian Christinsen, who
took them on for News Review and
are presently trying for work with
BBC Radio.
Flash Haddock describe their
humour as a cross between Monty
Python and Not the 9 O 'Clock News.
Made up of short sketches, their act
stands out from the run of the mill
stand-up comedy, most of which has
little variation. They pride themselves
on their rapid turnover of material,
even their favourite sketches are
continually being revamped.
If you fancy the idea of Ronald
Reagan fooling the world into
thinking he's thick or a very tongue

evengelists, Flash Haddock are
appearing, with a new revue,
Robocod at IC on Wednesday March
23 at 9pm in the Lounge. At £1 for
advance tickets or £1.50 on the door,
they are well worth a trip to see.
Tickets are available from Soc Reps
and Normans.
But why Flash Haddock? 'Fish are
essentially funny and we were flicking
through an old Queen LP at the time,
we were very nearly A Night at the
