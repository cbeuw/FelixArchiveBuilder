The 1988 Grand Prix kicks off on
Easter Sunday (April 3) with Round
One of the Formula One World
Championships, the Brazilian Grand
Prix at Rio de Janeiro.
New drivers, new teams, new
engines and new rules make this the
most potentially exciting year for a
long time.
The most important rule changes
are the second phase of the plans to
reduce the power of the turbo-charged
engines before they are banned totally
in 1989. The turbos will be restricted
to a boost pressure of 2.5 bar and a
fuel allowance of 150 litres per race.
World champion Nelson Piquet
leaves Cannon-Williams for Camel-
Lotus but retains Honda Turbo
power. His team-mate will be the
Japanese driver Satoru Nakajima,
who should again carry the miniature
TV camera that gives such stunning
pictures, particularly when Naka
drives into the back of other cars!
Nigel Mansell, now fully recovered
from his Japanese GP practice
This has been one of my saddest
weeks in my time as FELIX racing
accident, spearheads the atmospheric
attack in his Cannon-Williams-Judd.
The Judd is a new V8 by John Judd's
engine development concern in
Northampton, and will also be used
by the March and Ligier teams.
Ferrari ended last season on a high
with back-to-back wins in Japan and
Australia. They retain the strong
driver pairing of Gerhard Berger and
Michele Alboreto, and also V6 turbo
engines. The new chassis will,
however, be the first Ferrari designed
by an Englishman John Barnard from
his R & D base in Guildford.
The strongest driver line up of all
must be at Marlboro McLaren where
twice world champion Alain Prost
(who has won more Grand Prix (28)
than any other driver) is joined by
Brazilian Ayrton Senna. Having
another superstar as a team-mate has
never bothered Prost and I confidently
expect him to consistently outrace
Senna.
The only other possible winners
that I can see are the Benettons,
beautifully painted in the bright
colours of the Italian knitwear
manufacturer's garments. In Thierry
Boutsen they have one of the most
experienced but unlucky drivers
around. The second half of last season
showed that given mechanical
reliability Thierry should win races
and this year I expect him to break
his duck. His team-mate is the
talented but underrated Italian
Alessandro Nannini. After two years
with the small Minardi team Sandro
has rightly earned a seat with a top
team.
The Rio circuit is a flat, 3.1 mile
collection of medium speed corners
with a long back straight.
Temperatures will be extremely high
and most teams should be making
mid-race pit stops for new tyres.
Predictions—Ferrari have been
setting the pace in pre-season testing
so I'll go for a Gerhard Berger hat-
trick with Thierry Boutsen the best
placed of the atmospherics.
Highlights will be on BBC TV's
Grand Prix programme in the
evening. Check press for exact time.
The Easter holiday sees the start of
the two major European
championships.
F3000 International is the training
ground for future Formula One
drivers, with single seater Grand
Prix-like cars with three litre engines.
Hopes for a British champion are
realistic with Russell Spence in a
works Rait, Mark Blundell in a works
Lola, Gary Evans and Andy Wallace
in G E M Raits and Johnny Herbert in
an EJR Reynard. The first round is
at Jerez in Spain on April 17th and
the series will visit three British
circuits (Silverstone, Brands Hatch
and Birmingham) during the summer.
The European Touring Car
Championship (ETC) starts at Monza,
Italy this Sunday (27th) with round
two at Donington Park (on the A453
near East Midlands Airport) on April
17th. This is saloon car racing at its
best and is well worth a visit,
particularly if you've never watched
motor racing before. The cars look
like road cars, the crowds aren't
claustrophobic like a Grand Prix and
Donington is a beautiful circuit.
Expect the pacesetters to be the works
Texaco Ford Sierra Cosworths of the
Eggenberger team and the works
BMW M3's of the Schnitzer and
Linder teams. Also worth watching
is the Bigazzi BMW M3 of former
Grand Prix driver Jacques Laffite and
Prime Minister's son Mark Thatcher.
The main rally of the holiday is the
Rothman's Circuit of Ireland, round
two of the Shell Oil RAC Open
Championship. After the surprise win
by Penti Airikkala on the Cartel
International, the Ford Sierra
Cosworths should win this all tarmac
event. Favourite is Jimmy McRae
with Phil Collins an outside bet to
score his first international win in his
disgusting pink car.
If you see any motorsport on TV
and think that you'd like to try it, then
don't go and be a loony on the roads
but come and see the City & Guilds
College Motor Club (open to all IC
students) about our programme of
rallies, circuit trips, racing schools
and skidpan visits.
correspondent. I stuck all my money
on a pig—a bloody three-legged pig.
Playschool lost the Gold Cup. He
didn't just lose it—he was obliterated.
Having told everyone in the College,
from the Rector right down to the
very lowest form of life (FELIX
Editor) to back Playschool, I now
realise that I couldn't pick my nose,
never mind a winner.
I attended the Cheltenham Festival
last Tuesday. There was a heavy Irish
contingent present noticeably in the
Guinness tent. They gave a mighty
roar when their selections romped
home.
I witnessed a lot of money changing
hands, particularly in the fifth race.
Cats Eyes was heavily backed at the
course, I saw several hundreds being
handed over to trackside bookies.
They must have breathed a heavy sigh
of relief when it was narrowly beaten
by a length or so.
Having advised everyone wrongly
I am now going into hiding.
Paul Shanley,
Brazil.
