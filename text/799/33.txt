£30,000 Debate
Should Imperial College join the
National Union of Students? This will
be the topic of debate tomorrow
(Thursday) at 1pm in the Union
Lounge. All Imperial students can
attend this potentially lively meeting.
Speaking in favour of IC joining the
NUS should be Vicky Phillips
(National President) or possibly
another member of the National
Executive and seconding will be a
representative from IC's pro-NUS
society. Opposing will be Imperial
College Union President Ian/Sydney
Howgate/Harbour-Bridge, seconded
by Alan Rose (Deputy President).
If ICU does join the NUS this could
cost the Union in the region of
£ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , however, some students
would like to see IC getting involved
in the NUS's campaigns against
student loans, poll tax, etc.
There will be opportunities to ask
questions afterwards. Given the
strong views of many students on the
matter, this should be well worth
going to.
Gliding
February 19 was the date of Imperial
College Gliding Club's most
auspicious event, the Annual Dinner,
held at the Royal Aeronautical
Society.
Both past and present student
members attended. Among the invited
guests were officials of Lasham
Gliding Society including Mr Derek
Piggot, recognised as the world's
foremost gliding instructor, and a
party from Surrey University Gliding
Club.
The catering and service were
excellent. The after-dinner speech
was given by Mr Bill Kronfeld, an ex-
IC student, who spoke of his father's
major contribution to gliding this
century, including the first cross-
country flight and the first glider
traverse of the English Channel.
The annual award presentations
also took place. Of current students
Steve Brooker was awarded the
President's Cup for an 80km cross-
country flight.
Apart from Surrey University being
awarded the Brunt Trophy for the best
height gain, a good time was had by
all!
So if you're interested in getting the
Hi, there. It's that time of the year
again when baskets are rigged,
burners are turned on, envelopes are
inflated and the skies are reached.
Yes, despite the awful weather
conditions so far this year, we have
managed to find the odd couple of
days to fly our hot-air balloon
'Second-Wind'.
A few weekends ago we took the
balloon up to Loughborough
University who also have an active
balloon club. We drove up Friday
evening with a newly bought right
wing mirror sellotaped on (no thanks
to the club who lost the previous one).
Arriving a bit late we headed
straight for the nearest watering-hole
where the next day's plans were
carefully (?) laid out. Also having
forgotten a complete set of air-maps,
our old OS maps were hurriedly
marked up with all the nearby air
traffic zones (useful places to know
about!). We all then crashed out at a
friend's house (all twelve of us).
Next morning bright and early we
arranged to meet at the university
grounds. We eventually found the
correct launch site, to be greeted by
a number of other local balloonists.
Soon all the balloons were up and
ready to go except 'Primebang', the
rather old and leaky Loughborough
balloon which, even after much
Brunt Trophy back for IC, or would
relish the chance of explaining to your
bank manager why, on top of a £ 4 0 0
overdraft, you have a bill for £ 8 0 of
wine then come along to Aero 254 at
5.30pm on Thursday.
Greenpeace
There is now an active Greenpeace
support group for West London and
help is urgently needed with a variety
of fund-raising events (if you can
think of a use for a fifty foot inflatable
whale then let us know).
The first major event is the
Greenpeace Flag Day on April 9. If
you are around and could spare any
time to hassle people in High Street
Kensington and the surrounding area
please get in touch with me.
Greenpeace is a non-political
organisation which carries out a lot
of very worthwhile campaigns all of
which need your support to continue.
So if you can collect or just want to
get in touch with the support group
(which is nothing to do with Imperial
and has been set up by Greenpeace
supporters) then please contact me by
phoning 373 1736 (Alistair Goodall
in Flat 6) or via the Computing
pigeonholes.
Thanks a lot.

burning sadly refused to get off the
ground! In the end we managed to fly
nearly everybody, using Nottingham
University for the Sunday launch and
I believe a great weekend was had by
all.
A few of us also went flying last
weekend down at Newbury. The
weather was beautiful with the odd
flurries of snow glittering in the
sunshine at 2000 feet.
We passed nearby to a glider
airfield and saw them being pulled up
and then gracefully circled
downwards. Our final landing was
good but not very near to any access
roads. A kind farmer came to our
rescue in the form of a tractor which
he used to get all our equipment out
of the field. After a couple of frantic
telephone calls, our retrieve crew
eventually found us and then we all
headed for tea and hot-chocolate
fudge cake!
Interested in flying in the summer
term and over summer? (It really isn't
difficult—you just stand in the basket
and let the pilot do the rest!) Come
to one of our regular Thursday
lunchtime meetings at 1pm in the
Southside Upper Lounge (above the
bar)—just ask around for the
balloonists. Everybody's welcome.
