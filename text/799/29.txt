COMING SOON
Empire of the Sun
World War II, China is the setting for
this Steven Spielberg epic about he
corruption of innocence in times of
war; innocence being represented in
true Spielberg style by a schoolboy
who is separated from his parents. We
see the war through the eyes of the
youngster after Japanese forces take
Shanghai following the bombing of
Pearl Harbour. This film is an
exercise in airing Spielberg's
considerable talent as a film director,
but, although it is brilliantly and
skilfully shot, the film is overlong, the
storytelling is convoluted and
disjointed and our senses are battered
with sentimentality. Ultimately we
don't care what happens to the kid,
but we leave applauding the majesty
of it all.
Opens March 22.
Moonstruck
The daughter of a New York Italian
family agrees to marry a staid
bachelor and then falls madly and
passionately in love with his
tempestuous younger brother.
Cher stars in this fast-talking
comedy, and is nomnated for an
Oscar for her performance, indicating
that she is a lot better actress than she
is a singer. Nicholas Cage is the
drunken lout that Cher somehow falls
for in a moon-induced fling.
A film for all you Italian New
Yorkers out there.
Opens March 25
Wall Street
Michael Douglas will almost
definitely win the Best Actor Oscar
for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko,
a Wall Street corporate raider—the
epitome of capitalist greed—'a
Manhatten carnivore at his most
lethal...unscrupulous and morally
bankrupt'. Charlie Sheen plays a
character not unlike that he played in
Platoon; that of a young man who
doesn't realise what he's let himself
in for when he enters the financial
jungles of the Stock Market. An
impressive support cast includes
Daryl Hannah, Martin Sheen,
Terence Stamp and Sean Young. But
it is Michael Douglas who steals the
show with a nine-minute speech
declaring 'Greed is good'.
Opens April 29.
Broadcast News
Broadcast News is described as a
romantic comedy set in the world of
network television news
correspondents. It centres on a
developing love triangle between a
TV presenter (William Hurt), who
has good looks but the brains of a
turnip; a dedicated reporter (Albert
Brooks), who has brains but the looks
of a turnip; and a workaholic young
news producer (Holly Hunter). All
three leads have Oscar nominations.
The film is a bright and witty account
of the ins and outs of the TV biz,
though it is made by the people who
brought us the tedious Terms of
Endearment.
Opens April 8.
Three Men and a Baby
The three men in question are Tom
Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve
Guttenberg as fun-loving single men
who are confronted with their two
biggest fears: responsibility and
fatherhood, when a baby girl is left
on their doorstep.
The film is based on the excellent
French farce Three Men and a
Cradle. I dread to think what
Hollywood could have transformed
this into, but the film has been a
massive hit in the States, although just
how much of this is due to the pulling
power of the stars is uncertain.
Leonard 'Mr Spock' Nimoy directs
his first non-Star Trek feature film.
The Believers
Martin Sheen plays a New York
psychologist in this occult thriller
dealing with rituals, powers and
devotions, rooted in the mystic past,
which have entered the main stream
of modern America. The faith in
question is the Santeria, which to its
believers is a means of summoning
supernatural forces to heal the sick,
comfort the troubled and celebrate
human joy. However, like any belief
system, it is corrupted by people for
their own ends. John Schlesinger
directs this rarity—a horror film with
a message.
Opens April 8.
