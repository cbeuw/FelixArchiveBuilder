BOAT
Unseated
Despite a major catastrophe, Sunday
March 13 saw the IC Rowing Club
novice eight easily thrash all other
boats in the same class. Half-way
through the University of London
Head (which is the same course as the
Oxbridge boat race, in the opposite
direction) the bowmans seat gave way
beneath him, and refused to be
mended, making it impossible for him
to row. With balance seriously
impaired the crew had no chance of
winning the whole race (though the
final times suggest they could have
done). They had to be content with
winning their division by the
convincing margin of 58 seconds.
FOOTBALL
Crowd trouble
It must have been the last match of
the season. Before the largest crowd
of the season, the 6ths pulled off a
magnificent victory. We turned up on
time and marvelled at the heading
prowess of Harshul Patel in the warm-
up. Kings arrived minus a kit and half
an hour late. Kings scored first,
despite a brave attempt by Mike
Potter in goal, but Andy Draine kept
a clear head and slotted in the
equaliser. The same superstar then
crossed low for Alasdair Bamford to
turn in the second. Then came the
boring bit when Kings scored two
very fortunate goals. No sign of
Harshul's head yet!
After half-time came a flowing
movement of one-touch football
before Richard Miles slipped it home
to make it 3-3. Andy Draine poked
in the winner in a traditional
goalmouth scramble, leaving the 6ths
to desperately defend their slender
lead until the pressure was relieved
by two Kings players being carried
off. We never touched them, honest
ref!
Even this last ditch win leaves IC
6ths firmly rooted to the bottom of the
worst league in the whole of London
college football—so back to the bar
ready for next season!
Attendance: Five and a fox.
It's big
If you're still in London on
Saturday morning, an event not to be
missed is The Head of the River boat
race. This is the biggest event in the
rowing calendar, with more than 500
eights competing over a timed course
from Mortlake to Putney. The fun
starts at approximately 10.30pm and
there will be at least 4 crews from
Imperial needing your loud support.
But not that
big!
Compare this to the race on the
following Saturday, April 2, when
only two crews will be battling it out
over a similar course. Oxford and
Cambridge compete in 'The Boat
Race'. Hot favourite to be stroking
the Cambridge crew is ex-IC boy Guy
Pooley. Why not go down, cheer
them on and impress your friends by
saying T know 'im'.

Desperate
Dan
Last Saturday morning, IC hosted the
U L Intercollegiate Judo
Championships. This is an annual
competition between 3, man/woman
teams from UL College clubs with the
restriction that all competitors must
be below black-belt (Dan) grade.
IC entered one women's team—
Yoke-Foong Tan, Julie Beasley and
Beverly Moses, and two men's
teams—Henry Young, Jonathan Lean
and Steven Shorey in the 'A' team and
Nicola Maffulli, Jon Bird and Stuart
Wheaton in the 'B' team.
The men's competition was
organised as two pools of four,
followed by semi-finals and the final.
IC 'A' lost to Royal Holloway ' A ' ,
but beat U C L 'B' and LSE in their
pool, winning a place in the semi-
finals. IC 'B' were less fortunate,
losing to Q M C and U C L ' A ' , but
beating Royal Holloway 'B' 3-0. In
the semi-final, IC 'A' came up against
UCL 'A', but had to setde for bronze,
losing 1-2, U C L ' A ' went on to beat
QMC in the final.
Although comparatively few teams
were entered, the highlight of the day
was the women's competition. IC
fought through to the final
convincingly, to face UCL. In a close-
fought, nail-biting contest, IC finally
won 2-1.
HOCKEY
Imperial smashes Charing X
Imperial College 1st XI—4
Charing Cross 1st XI—0
A mild afternoon at Paddington
astroturf saw Imperial face league
leaders Charing Cross. Only a win
would keep IC's championship hopes
alive.
The first half was dominated by IC
but, although numerous chances were
created, none were converted. Both
Paul Skipworth and Michael Foxcroft
forced saves from the Charing Cross
goalkeeper and good work by Harry
Vamadevan proved fruitless. In the
brief moments that Charing Cross
ventured into the IC half they were
kept a bay by the solid performances
of John Stonham and Jim Garside.
However, a disappointing first half
finished 0-0.
A more determined IC side came
out after the interval and were soon
in the lead. A short corner was half-
saved and Justin Brooking flicked the
ball into the Charing Cross net. The
second goal quickly followed. A short
corner won by Andy Hall was
converted by Skipworth with a
powerful shot. The now rampaging
IC side allowed Charing Cross few
chances with Andy and Mark Lewis
controlling the opposition wingers.
Colin Wright's under-cut into the roof
of the Charing Cross goal made it 3-0
and another short corner conversion
by Skipworth made it 4-0.
This was a promising performance
by IC, and, with only two league
games left, the chances of finalising
on top look good.
