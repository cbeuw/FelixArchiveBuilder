With the US Masters fast approaching
(April 7-10) it's about time there was
something other than donkeys in
FELIX.
Players in form at the moment
include such new names as Jay Haas
and Steve Jones, as well as the old
favourites Sandy Lyle and Seve
Ballesteros. Seve, who had a dismal
season last year, started "Ms with a
Augusta
Preview
bang in the Spanish PGA, where he
broke the course record, and this must
count for something in Augusta. He
is quoted as being a joint favourite
with Greg Norman, whom I believe
to be grossly overrated.
The main danger for all the top
players, the man I believe will win,
is Ian Woosnam. He burst onto the
scene in a big way last year, earning
more than £ 1 million, and was
inspirational during the Ryder Cup.
It was his play during that competition
in Muirfield Village, Ohio that makes
him such a good hope, managing to
find the greens accurately and
cheaply, and holding them superbly.
Other candidates are Nick Faldo,
the Open champion, whose American
form is poor but prone to moments
of brilliance and Bernhard Langer,
who won in 1985. Tom Watson and
Mark McNulty must also be hopeful
of continuing success. I'm confident
that 1988 will produce European
winners to both the Masters and the
US Open, the competition is so hot
that it'll be worth staying up all night
watching it live on BBC1 on the
Friday and Saturday nights.
I am writing this nearly two weeks in advance of the games due to FELIX
deadlines, so I can't refer to last week's games as usual. All games are on
Saturday March 26 with 3pm kick offs.
Charlton vs Oxford
Selhurst Park (Selhurst BR)
This is a real Division One relegation
battle with points absolutely vital to
both sides at this stage of the season.
Charlton have shown a slight revival
in recent weeks, hitting West Ham
and Sheffield Wednesday for three.
Garth Crooks has been
knocking in the goals for
the Reds and with the
return to the Valley an
almost certainty,
tilings could still
change for the
better.
Oxford lost a
recent Littlewoods
Cup semi-final to
Luton and must
now concentrate on
survival. To add to
their trouble
Maurice Evans has
resigned as
manager. Their
chorus of 'Yellow'
seems forlorn. This
will be a close one
but I think that the
home team will
sneak it by the odd
one in three.
Chelsea vs Southampton
Stamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)
The home team really do need the
points from this one since, at the time
of printing, they have had no victories
since October 31 (I seem to have said
this a few times since then!). Kerry
Dixon seems set to stay at the Bridge
despite his wishes to move to
Highbury and Pat Nevin's name has
also been mentioned in transfer talk.
Southampton are in mid-table but still
need a few more points to secure their
place in the top flight next season.
Danny Wallace has shown some good
form this season but they are not
really a very strong force. This looks
like a bland draw but the team with
a twinkle of initiative could steal
it...hopefully.
Tottenham vs Nottingham Forest
White Hart Lane (Seven Sisters tube)
Venables' men take on Cloughie's
younger men. Since taking over at
White Hart Lane, Venables (I hope
that he never takes over the England
job) hasn't really done much with
Spurs only in mid-table. A recent
home defeat by Norwich only
emphasised their problems, not to
mention a 4-0 thrashing in a friendly
against Monaco. Forest have made it
to the FA Cup semi-final for Clough
(like I predicted young man...) with
his son Nigel proving a real chip off
the old block. They have a good
young side with a strong eye for the
future. Brian still thinks they can win
the league, who dares to argue? I
think that they will win this one to
complete a North London double.
Brentford vs Brighton
Griffin Park (Brentford Central)
A third division game between two
sides on the fringes of the promotion
race should draw a decent crowd. The
visitors, once a proud Division One
team only five years ago, are
beginning the long haul back from
obscurity. Their star striker is Gary
Nelson. He was bought for just
£ 7 5 , 0 0 0 from Plymouth last summer
and has nearly thirty goals to his name
already this season. Argyl tried to buy
him back recently, what a bunch of
jokers! This game also has a draw
written all over it.
Leyton Orient vs Swansea
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
Orient are still in the promotion race
and must win this to keep up with
high flyers Wolves and Cardiff.
Swansea were taken from the fourth
to the first by John Toshack and even
got into the UEFA Cup, but he has
gone to Real Sociadad in Spain and
the Welsh team have fallen to whence
they came. They almost went out of
existance last year and times are hard
indeed. I expect the O's to take the
points.
Game of the day: Spurs vs Forest.
