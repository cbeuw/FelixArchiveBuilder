intentional understatement, realism,
intolerance, hypochondria and
melancholy.
Exaggerated uplengths indicate a
tendency towards the intellectual and
spiritual spheres, ideals and illusions.
Exaggerated underlengths
symbolise realism, the qualities of an
organiser.
The underlengths also reveal the
writer's attitude to his unconscious
impulses and sexual life. Sexual
tendencies in handwriting are a study
in themselves; the precision with
which all the varieties of sexual
inclination and perversities are
sometimes mirrored in handwriting is
really astonishing.
Broad handwriting originates from
an unrestricted movement of the hand
whereas narrow writing is an
obviously restricted sign.
Broad:- lack of restriction, likes
travel, spends lavishly on himself,
speaks about himself and doesn't
really care whether his audience is
interested or not, self-assured,
indiscrete, vain, very social.
Narrow:- inhibited, economical,
mean and distrustful, narrow-minded,
shy.
Form & Degree of Connection
Angular connection:- prefers firmness
to compromise, persistent, sulky,
cruel, reliable.
Rounded connection:- amiable,
openly friendly, kind,
Arcade connection:-
soft.
diplomatic,
calm, calculated, hypocrite.
Wavy connection:- intelligent.
%
Degenerating connections that
make the word look like a single
thread and partially illegible is the
main sign of hysteria.
The degree of a person's
handwriting is very difficult to
change. Connected handwriting
shows that the writer is logical and
not easily distracted. If the connection
continues through the whole sentence
it shows an excessive desire for
relationships which are remote.
Disconnected writing shows that the
writer has many different ideas. This
style can be found in the writing of
people of unusual imagination and
intuitive genius. If you find both
frequent and large intervals inside
words this is a sign of serious
overstrain of the mind.
Regularity
Regular handwriting is a sign of a
regular mind. If regularity is just a
version of copy book writing then it
indicates a lack of vitality, personality
and imagination.
Irregular writing shows many-sided
interests, excitability, nervousness,
lack of steadiness.
s,
Quick writing is a sign of a person
who is spontaneous, objective and
pertinent. Slow writing is calculated
writing.
Quick:- intelligence, enthusiasm,
neglect of details.
Slow:- artistic, aesthetic, poseur,
laziness.
Fullness is achieved by the arcs,
slopes and circles that cover a persons
handwriting. Full writing means
imagination, vision and a creative
mind. Lean writing discloses abstract
thinking, lack of imagination and
soberness.
P.
ressure
Strong:- energy and vitality,
pessimist.
Slight:-weak or skilled.
v v ' If vnn
If you watch someone stand up
straight, you know that he is an
independent individual. If he leans
forward, he seems to be longing for
other people. If he leans backwards,
he seems to be afraid of people. So
it is with that person's handwriting:
Upright:- independence, cool, calm.
Slanting to the right:- extraversion,
social, excitable, passionate,
successful.
Slanting to the left:- introversion,
isolation, forced, affected.
The person who writes to the right
is capable of strong sentiments such
as love, hate and self-sacrifice. Any
exaggeration towards the right is a
sign of giving. Any exaggeration
towards the left is a sign of retiring
or commonsense.
What to Look for
Vitality:- quick writing, strong
pressure, large and rhythmic writing.
Bad health:- weak writing, small
writing, breaks or trembling features.
Energy and willpower:- Regular
writing, those of vitality:
Artistic:- pasty writing, full writing.
Imagination:- full writing.
Suicidal tendencies:- Crossing out
one's signature with a final stroke
placed to the extreme left.
Megalomania:- over-large hand-
writing.
Intelligence:- good layout, clear
spacing, simplification, quick writing.
Self-confidence:- large, broad, quick
writing.
Egotistic:- left tendencies, very large,
very broad.
Sexual tendencies:- Exaggeration of
underlengths.
This has been a very brief look at
the basic tendencies in people's
handwriting. Treat the 'facts' with a
pinch of salt as it's all meant to be just
a bit of fun anyway. The only time
this will ever be of use to you is when
you are asked to fill in a job
application in your own
handwritingâ€”because there's
certainly some well-paid graphologist
just dying to tell your possible
employer how lazy/intelligent/
sexually aware you are!
