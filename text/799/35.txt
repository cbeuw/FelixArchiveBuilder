Rayleigh—rest in peace
The Edinburgh Festival is an annual
arts festival which takes place over a
span of three weeks during the month
of August. It is a celebration of music,
fine art, literature, film and theatre
and is attended by people from all
over the world.
The Imperial College Dramatic
Society has taken part in the Festival
for many years, the last six of which
we have also administered our own
venue in Edinburgh; Theatre West
End. It is situated in a prime location,
in Edinburgh's main shopping
precinct. The Society performs three
productions at the venue, under the
name of Theatre West End Repertory
Productions. Last year, the three
shows included Bent by Martin
Sherman, Seascape by Edward Albe,
and The Collection and The Lover—
a double bill by Harold Pinter. These
were all very well received.
Auditions for the three plays which
the Imperial College Dramatic
Society will be presenting in
Edinburgh this August will take place
next term on Sunday May 1st, and
Wednesday May 4th at 1pm. Further
details about the meeting place for
auditions, and the productions to be
presented this summer will be posted
around College (look out on the
walkway!) and appear in FELIX at
the beginning of next term.
Those people who are cast in the
Theatre West End repertory
productions would have to ensure that
they are available in London during
July (rehearsals are in the evenings),
and would have to keep the month of
August free for the Festival. It is a
commitment, but the vast majority of
those who have made that
commitment in previous years would
agree that it is worthwhile, as
participating in the Festival is a
rewarding and memorable
experience.
So, if you are interested in taking
part in the Edinburgh Festival this
summer (as a performer, or
otherwise), then make a note in your
diary of May 1st and May 4th. And
remember—these auditions are open
to everybody: You don't have to be
a member of Dramsoc. Everyone is
welcome to audition and stands a fair
chance of being cast.
Watch this space for further details.

At the end of this week the 26
residents of Rayleigh House will be
moving out for the Easter vacation
and for good.
The House which is situated in
Queensbury Place, just opposite the
Natural History Museum, has
recently been sold by the College to
pay for renovations to Fisher Hall, the
new property in Evelyn Gardens,
purchased last year from the Royal
College of Art.
Rayleigh House was originally
bought in 1968 and named after The
Fourth Baron Lord Rayleigh FRS, the
Chairman of the Governing Body of
Imperial College (1936-47)
Being such a small community, the
atmosphere within Rayleigh is one of
the friendliest and warmest of all the
College Houses and it is with great
sadness and reluctance that the present
residents are leaving. Many previous
residents have also expressed their
sorrow at the sale.
The House was originally to be sold
last summer, but this idea was shelved
because the renovation work on
Fisher Hall was taking longer than
expected and there were not enough
rooms ready for the 1987-88 intake.
Consequently this has meant that the
students in Rayleigh must move in the
middle of the academic year,
disrupting the third year re-applicants
just before their finals.
Most of the residents of Rayleigh
House will be moving to Fisher Hall
but a few will be accommodated in
other Houses and Halls. The Warden
Mark Goldstone is moving to a flat
in Evelyn Gardens and can be
contacted during the day on internal
extension 4772.
The House was to celebrate its 20th
birthday this year, but this was
cancelled because of the sale and it
is now hoped that a formal event will
be held next term to mark the closure
of the House.

Cookery Club
Shergar Stew
Serves 6 normal people or 4 pigs.
2 lb stewing beef
2 level tbs flour
3 oz butter
1 onion (finely chopped)
2 cloves garlic (crushed)
4 oz carrots (thick sliced)
2 oz celery (chopped)
2 oz turnips (cut into chunks)
Some grated nutmeg
14 tsp powdered allspice
4 pints Guinness
Salt and pepper
Pre-heat the oven to gas mark Vi,
2 5 0 ° F , 130°C. Use a large, heavy
frying pan and casserole dish.
Whack an ounce of butter in the
casserole and over a gentle heat,
sweat the onion and the garlic for 10
minutes. Open the first bottle of
Guinness. Heat the frying pan and add
another ounce of butter. Drink the
first bottle of Guinness and open the
second.
Meanwhile, toss the cubes of meat
in the flour and brown them a few at
a time in the frying pan in the hot
butter. Transfer them into the
casserole to join the onions and the
garlic. Whilst doing this, drink the
second bottle of Guinness. Open the
third.
When the meat is all in, do the veg.
Add a little more butter if you need
it. Brown the veg a little at the corners
and edges. Drink the third bottle of
Guinness and open the fourth bottle
of Guinness.
When all the veg has been doshed
into the casserole, sprinkle the spices
in, the salt and pepper and the last
bottle of Guinness. Resist the
temptation at this stage to drink it—
you'll need it for the recipe.
Don't worry at this stage if it looks
like you've overdone it on the
Guinness. The slow cooking willtake
care of it. Next, bring it up to
simmering point and whack it in the
oven. Now comes the good bit. Leave
it in the oven for six hours. If you've
timed it right, it should now be 11
o'clock on a Saturday morning. Shoot
down the pub and stay there until
closing time. In the bookie, a few bets
and then back home for a few pre-
dinner drinks courtesy of the local
offie. Sling together some mashed
spuds and serve up this culinary
delight whilst watching the A Team.
