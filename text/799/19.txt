Tracing your family
tree can be a
rewarding pastime
and can be likened
to doing a jigsaw
puzzle. So is it
worth the time and
effort to check
through pages of
records just to find
out when Great
Aunt so-and-so got
married.
Have you ever wondered who your
ancestors were and what they did? It
is possible to find out a great deal of
information, and it is an interesting
insight into the recent past. Starting
from scratch can be quite daunting,
yet with persistence slowly but surely
the branches can be found and the
roots dug up.
To start with it is best to gather as
much information as you can from
living relatives, and family documents
(there may be a family bible, so dig
out the loft). After doing this
construct the best family tree you can,
even with just approximate dates.
To proceed further you will need
to consult external records. There are
several sources of genealogical
information including church
registers, census returns and the
public records. From July 1837 all
births, marriages and deaths in
England and Wales have been
registered; Scottish civil registration
began in 1855 and Irish in 1864.
Church records are usually the most
easily reached as most have been
deposited in your local county or
district archives which are usually
free to visit. Almost all denominations
are covered, although it does
complicate matters if your forebears
changed church, or were married,
baptised or buried in their local
church or chapel.
Most of the older records suffer
from bad handwriting and horribly
ornate copper plate scrawls, so
patience is needed to look slowly
through the records. This way it is

small amount of information, to find
your ancestors. Be prepared for
surprises—there are almost bound to
be a few skeletons in the cupboard,
and you may be surprised at how
recently people were still unable to
sign their own names on documents.
Along the way you will meet other
people doing the same thing as you
are, and often they have tips from
many years' experience. There are no
such things as hard and fast rules in
this game, but beware of short cuts
and be as accurate as you can, for it
is easy to get lost down a false track.
However, eventually you may hit a
dead-end, for instance if a person
moved into an area from an unknown
origin. In this case it is worth
checking the public records. The
English and Welsh ones are now held
in St Catherine's House, Kingsway
WC2. The general public can check
the indices which give approximate
dates and places of events. To obtain
actual copies of the certificates you
have to pay (£5 if you go there, look
in the relevant index and fill out the
form yourself; it is much more if you
send in requests by post). Thus to
build up the family tree this way could
prove to be very expensive, hence it
should be used more as a last resort.
The Scottish records are held in the
General Register House, Princes
Street, Edinburgh.
Other sources of information
include copies held by the Mormons
which can be consulted free of charge
in their Chapel on Exhibition Road.
The ten yearly censuses can provide
useful evidence and these can be
examined at your county or district
archives (but only for your area) or,
for the whole of Great Britain, at the
Land Registry Building in Portugal
Street—just round the corner from St
Catherine's House. The staff are very
helpful and photocopies of the records
held on microfilm can be obtained at
70p a time. This way approximate
ages, professions and approximate
places of birth can be obtained. It is
difficult to check the censuses taken
after 1881 due to the 100 year rule
of confidentiality, although direct
descendents can obtain information
from the 1891 and 1901 censuses
from St Catherine's House for a fee.
Other possible records worth
checking out, although not as useful,
are the register of (post 1858) wills
held at Somerset House, Electoral
registers (although universal sufferage
is only comparatively recent so only
a few (rich) ancestors can be found
this way), court proceedings and
Hearth Tax returns. Also worth
checking are the records of mines, or
companies where your forebears
worked.
After a while a pattern will emerge
and you will begin to pick up
detective-like techniques which will
increase your efficiency. It is often
useful to regard each find with
suspicion and ask yourself whether
the person has exactly the right name,
is about the right age and comes from
the region you expect.
There are numerous books printed
about the subject and there is bound
to be a local group, possibly at your
local library, so it could be something
to do to prevent boredom this
Summer.
