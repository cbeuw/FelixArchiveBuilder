Historic—the names and the places
IC's history, dating
back to before the
1907 Charter of
Incorporation, has
been dominated by
great scientists and
leaders. Their
contribution to the
College's present
form is recognised
in the names of the
buildings around
College. But why
in particular are
those elite
remembered in
such a way? Read

Apes?
Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95)
Dean of Normal School of Science
(1881-95)
Despite spending only two years at
school, by self-tuition Huxley won a
scholarship to Charing Cross Medical
School, only to leave in 1846 to join
the Royal Navy as an assistant
surgeon. His ship, HMS Rattlesnake,
toured the South Seas, and Huxley
used this time to study marine life. On
his return in 1851, he was elected
FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society)
and took three years research leave
from the RN, later being struck off.
In 1854 he bacame a lecturer at the
RSM (the part which was to become
BY MARTIN COLE
the RCS). During his life he published
some 150 research papers of a largely
zoological nature.
But Huxley is probably best
remembered for his support of
Darwin's theory of evolution and in
particular a famous clash with Bishop
Wilberforce at the British Association
Oxford. The Bishop, nicknamed
'Soapy Sam' on account of his verbal
skills, addressed the audience first
using eloquent arguments to dismiss
Darwin's The Origin of Species.
Despite winning the audience over,
he could not, however, resist a direct
attack at Huxley, asking, 'Is it on his
grandfather's or his grandmother's
side that the ape ancestry comes in?'
While this may have served to
ridicule Huxley it also justified 'the
severeist retort' that Huxley could
devise. After waiting for quiet,
Huxley began to speak. In closing he
launched his counter-attack, 'No man
should be ashamed of having an ape
for his grandfather. If there were an
ancestor whom I should feel shame
in recalling it would rather be a
man—a man of restless and versatile
intellect—who, not content with an
equivocal success in his own sphere
of activity, plunges into scientific
questions with which he has no real
acquaintance, only to obscure them by
an aimless rhetoric, and distract the
attention of his hearers from the real
point at issue by eloquent digressions
and skilled appeals to religious
prejudice.'
The effect was, apparently,
tremendous with one lady fainting,
another leaping from her chair and an
ovation to rival the Bishop's.

Radar, Jets and Bouncing Bomb
Sir Henry Tizard (1885-1959)
Rector (1929-42)
Reading any biography of Tizard, one
can easily get the impression that he
single-handedly defeated Nazi
Germany. And, indeed, his
contribution to Britian's war effort
was incredible by any standards.
In the First World War Tizard
served with the Royal Flying Corps,
working on bomb sights and testing
new aeroplanes. After the war, he
was involved in research on internal
combustion engines, becoming Rector
of IC in 1929. As Rector he secured
the money for Beit Hall, and also
ensured that the land north of Imperial
Institute Road would be used
exclusively for education, with
museums to the south.
In 1933 as chairman of the
Aeronautic Research Csmmittee he
worked with PMS Blackett on
detecting enemy aircraft with radio
beams and tracking them to allow
fighters to intercept. By 1939 Britain
had a network of radar stations that
was to prove crucial to her defence
in the war. Also in this year, Tizard
secured uranium ore for British
research into a nuclear weapon and
some for Prof G P Thomson (son of
I J Thomson) at IC. His other
outstanding achievements of this
period included his support of Sir
Frank Whittle in developing the jet
;ngine; his efforts in winning
American sympathy and, more
importantly, technical support in
1940, and his encouragement of sir
Barnes Wallis' dam-busting bomb.
Tizard later described Wallis'
bouncing bomb as the 'finest
individual technical achievement of
the war'.
