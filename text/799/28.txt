Revi
FILM,
Throw Momma From The
Train
Danny De Vito's last two films Tin
Men and Ruthless People displayed
two extremes of comedy. In Ruthless
People, anything was allowed as long
as it got a laugh, and it was quite
brilliantly over-the-top. Barry
Levinson's Tin Men was a much
gentler comedy, which extracted its
comedy from real people in real
situations (in this case it was
aluminium sidings salesmen in the
fifties). Throw Momma From The
Train is pitched somewhere in
between the two, with a man's
attempts to kill his mother, after
having been inspired by a Hitchcock
movie, supplying the unreal element,
while De Vito and Billy Crystal
(better known as Joey out of Soap)
play real people.
De Vito plays Owen Lift, a man as
emotionally stunted as he is
physically, since he is still looking
after his witch of a mother (a
terrifying performance from Anne
Ramsey). The gargoyle-like mother
still bosses and hits Owen like a child,
and his only escape are the essays he
writes for his weekly English class,
in which he fantasises about
murdering his mother, but he can
never bring himself to do it.
His English teacher (Billy Crystal)
also has someone he would like to
murder. His ex-wife stole his first
novel, which has turned out to be a
best-seller and he's suffering from
writer's block, while she's laughing
all the way to the bank.
Crystal advises De Vito to go and
see a Hitchcock film, in order to
improve his attempt at thriller writing.
De Vito sees Stranger on a Train, in
which two men swap murders, and,
knowing of Crystal's wishes, takes his
suggestion too literally and goes off
to murder his wife, hoping that
Crystal will murder his mother.
De Vito's directorial debut is a
pleasing if not side-splitting, comedy,
in which he shows some nice touches
and a steady hand. The film, however
is not quite consistently funny in order
to keep the momentum going. The
photography is well structured and
neatly parodies some Hitchcock
scenes, but the drabness of the colours
sometimes makes the plot-line of
matricide more morbid than comic.
Billy Crystal is never quite
satisfactory as the weak-willed
teacher, despite some good scenes.
However, having said this, the film
has some great gags and De Vito
excellently plays the mild-mannered
Owen, who, in his naivety, can't see
what's wrong with murdering his
mother. (But after seeing her in
action, neither could I). The film is
worth seeing for Ramsey's
performance alone, which is a
combination of all the faults of every
mother. I initially thought that
showing a preview of such a film on
Mothers' Day was sublimely sick, but
Owen's mother only made me
appreciate mine all the more.

Orphans
Orphans is a beautiful film dealing
with themes fo parentage, family
love, anger and the control of
agression. Director Alan J Pakula
flicks between moods of hilarity,
despair, affection and - fear
effortlessly. Treat (Matthew Modine)
and Philip (Kevin Anderson) are a
couple of dead-end kids living in
Newark in a shack of a house
resembling Bate's motel. Philip is
housebound for fear of the outdoors
and Treat supports them by stealing
(an occupation for which he has a
flair). Treat is master over his
younger brother, treating him like a
pet dog. Philip seems to emphasize
this; he is like a frightened animal,
crawling like a monkey.
Their world is changed irrevocably
by the appearance of drunken
gangster Harold (Albert Finney) who
Treat hopes to hold for ransom. The
tables are swiftly turned and Harold
sets about taming the two brothers.
Harold represents different things
to each of them. There are tender
moments when he gives Philip the
encouragement he has always needed;
he hugs his shoulders, lets him feel
the rain for the first time on his face
and watches him venture for the first
time into the outside world clutching
a map of Newark. To Treat he is a
teacher, showing him how to behave
and how to control his violent temper.
But to both of them he is a father who
they love and for whom they express
grief when he is gone.
Albert Finney is superb, bringing
out the range in Harold's character
believably. Matthew Modine is a
suitably angry young man with an
innocent streak and Kevin Anderson
makes the transition from caged pet
to independence a joy to watch.

Baby Boom
Baby Boom is the kind of film you
expect to hate and are embarrassed to
admit that you actually enjoyed. It is
the first of a clutch of films about
babies soon to be released in this
country and continues the trend
towards the straght-forward, good
clean fun type of romantic/domestic
comedies which are appearing at an
ever-increasing rate (a la Roxanne,
Nadine and Blind Date)
It mixes a typically eighties issue,
that of the career woman in the
business of high finance, with the
farcical potential of a 13 month old
baby left on the proverbial doorstep.
The result is similar in many ways to
the Hollywood 'crazy comedies' of
the thirties and forties which
concerned the privileged classes doing
cracy things. It's the kind of thing
Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn
might have starred in.
At first the look of the film is
classic, based heavily on the best of
twentieth century fashion and design;
J C Wiatt (Diane Keaton) works in
New York in a skyscraper designed
by the modernist Miers van der Raoke
and lives in a chic art deco apartment
building with a Corbusier furniture
suite and a Lichtenstein on the wall.
The impression is of class and style
with no warmth, just like JC's life (it
takes her and her live-in lover just
four minutes to make love. Enough
time to boil an egg).
However, the texture changes when
she decides to quit the New York rat
race and move, with baby Elizabeth,
into her dream country farmhouse in
picturesque Vermont, all patchwork
quilts and Mom's applie pie type
stuff. Here the style is quite different;
JC has been brought down to earth
from her skyscrapers to a cozy kind
of snow covered existence in the
country, reminding one of White
Christmas and other such sentimental
old films.
The cast are excellent, giving their
characters the warmth and humanity
to elevate this from an embarrassment
of a film into something quite
watchable. They comprise oscar
winner Diane Keaton, Pulitzer prize
wining playwright Sam Shepard,
Harold Ramis who co-wrote National
Lampoon's Animal House and
Ghostbusters, and Sam Wanamaker
whose project to recreate
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre is
currently under construction.
The plot can be predicted before the
opening credits have finished.
Nevertheless Baby Boom does have
a kind of message, outlined by Keaton
in a meeting: 'It's possible for
someone to have a fullfilling career
as well as a satisfying family life'.
