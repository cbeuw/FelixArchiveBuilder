Spanner & Bolt liberated
The Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU) successfully liberated both
mascots of the City & Guilds Union
(C&GU), Spanner & Bolt, yesterday.
A member of RCSU managed to
stowaway in the car which was
carrying the mascots, after they had
left a C&GU meeting. The car was
left behind Linstead Hall, with the
mascots still in the boot. The student
then called the Mascotry team which
opened the boot and took the mascots.
At first Guilds denied that the
mascots had been taken but later it
became clear that RCSU had indeed
removed them.
RCSU plan to ransom the mascots
back to Guilds for Rag.
The City and Guilds Hustings UGM took place yesterday. The Presidential
candidates, Ralph Greenwell—proposed by Duncan Royle, and Chris
Home—proposed by Chris Greenwood, each had three minutes to say
why they thought they should be elected next year. With neither candidate
reaching quota on thefirstallocation, the second placed votes were counted.
This proved to be the closest ever presidential election in the history of
Guilds with 49firstplace votes and 62 second place votes cast for each
candidate. Under Guilds election rules, it was left for Returning Officer,
Alan Hepper, to have the casting vote. He ruled that as Mr Greenwell
was a second year, the vote should be cast in his favour, and so he was
elected and subsequently ratified as next year's President.
In the election for Vice-President, Max Kallios was returned unopposed
after Chris Home announced his decision not to stand down to VP
candidate.
The election for Hon Sec was close with Murray Williamson polling 61
votes to Chris Greenwood's 51.
Following the meeting, Mr Greenwell followed the tradition of buying
everyone present a round in the Queen's Arms, which came to £56.09.
Mr Greenwell told FELIX, 'I'm completely underwhelmed'.

Lawson gets rid of covenants
Parents whose children enter higher
education for the first time this
Autumn will be expected to pay up
to 25% less towards the student's
maintenance, following last week's
Budget. The difference will be made
up by their Local Education
Authority.
The reduction is compensation for
the end of the tax relief on student
covenants taken out after the Budget
and is much higher than had been
predicted. An unpublished report by
the Department of Education and
Science, however, shows that about
40% of dependent students receive
less than the assessed amount from
their parents.
The old and new assessment scales
will run side by side for the next four
academic years. Grants for students
already in full-time higher education
will still be calculated from the scales
as announced last December, whether
there is an existing covenant or not.
Exceptions to this rule will be students
who entered higher education before
the age of eighteen, whose birthdays
are after Budget day. Students who
change courses will continue to be
assessed under the old system unless
there is at least two years between
courses.
The rates of grant effective from
September 1st 1988 are £2425 for
students who live in London away
from home and £1630 for those living
wet 'SS
c . r f e )
at home. Outside London, the grant
is £2050 for students not living at
home.
Parental contributions are
calculated according to 'residual
income' from the scales shown below:

Notes:
1. No parent's actual contribution can exceed the
gross award entitlement of his child or children,
so at higher income levels the contribution
payable will often be less than shown by the
Scales.
