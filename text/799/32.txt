RCS A - 2
Ealing College Aâ€”0
Thanks to last minute negotiations
Dobson managed to get RCS Rugby
a game against Ealing College. The
game was started after a random
without a whistle volunteered to
referee.
RCS quickly took hold of the game
dominating most of the loose ball.
The first points were scored from a
kicked penalty. Th^; first try came
from a back row linking move which
left M Manning with a few yards to
run to score. Much of the game RCS
were hampered by deliberate bloching
and offside tactics by their opponents.
The resulting frustration only spurred
the team on further. Dobson was
quantum tunnelling his way through
their pack and won much line out ball.
The score did not progress further
until the second half when when B
Evans stumbled over the line. Many
opportunities were not taken, the
worst occurred when Manning
tripped over his ego when clear. A
much improved RCS side continuted
to put pressure on, not deterred when
the extraordinary fat person had the
ball.
INDOOR CRICKET
Calling pgs
I am interested in organising a
limited-over knockout, or round
robin, indoor cricket tournament for
PGs during the Easter holidays in the
Volleyball Courts.
Format:
1. 10-15 overs per side.
2. 6 persons per side.
3. Tennis ball instead of cricket
ball.
4. Other rules affecting scoring will
apply.
5. Enough equipment will be
provided.
Possible dates for tournament:
Wednesday March 30
Wednesday April 6
Wednesday April 13
If you can form a team of PGs from
your department contact Yishu Nanda
on int 4320 (leave a message if I'm
not in).
Before you laugh, indoor cricket on
the volleyball courts using a tennis
ball is good fun; it has been tried and
tested. PGs at IC do so very little
together so I hope many of you will
sieze this opportunity.

A term of running
Well folks, despite what you thought
the Cross-Country Club didn't die at
the end of last term. Gary Hart may
have pulled out of the US presidential
elections due to leg-over problems but
we've had an injury-free season!
In a very active term so far we've
been as far afield as Nottingham,
three times (who's that girl Dil?),
Leicester and just about everywhere
in London. The highlight of the term
was undoubtedly the Hyde Park
Relays hosted by ourselves, and is the
biggest student relay in Europe.
The first race of the term was a
friendly against Hercules Wimbledon.
The race was wc by Phil O'Brien,
who is an Olympic 'arathon runner,
which begs the ques; n what were we
doing there? E\ : so notable
performances for iC came from
Hubert S H, Trevor S and Stuart B.
Our first trip to Nottingham was for
the British Universities
championships. In a highly
competitive race superstar Dave
Knight only managed a top 200
placing but everyone's performances
were up to scratch. This included
Wimpey who added to his reputation
gained at last year's Hyde Park Relays
when he was again hospitalised after
the race.
In the London Colleges League
congratulations are in order as our
first team kept up their good
performances from last term to finish
a strong third. We were in fact the
first London College as the League
was won by Thames Polytechnic with
Oxford Polytechnic in second place.
This creditable result was brought
about by good performances and good
turnouts at Trent Park, Parliament
Hill Fields (and possibly Richmond
Park). We would have taken third
place one race earlier had Stuart B not
decided to do an extra lap at Trent
Park losing 50 places! Not even your
umbrella could help this time Stuart!
The final position of our top six
runners after six races and out of a
total of 280 competitors were as
follows:
11th Alex Gaskell
18th Dave Knight
22nd John H Porter
29th Hubert Schulte-Huxel
44th John Rowland
49th Ramin Dilmaghanian
The Richmond Park Race which is
organised by us saw Tim Butler of
Surrey winning his first and much
deserved league race after many
attempts. Hubert (our German
import) and Alex led our forces home
finishing 20th and 24th. My heart
bleeds for the lady runner who took
a nose dive into one of the many
puddles on the course. We fielded our
strongest ladies team of the year.
Alison Horrocks our lady orienteer
was 24th and Pam Samson 28th.
The last race in the League was
held at Parliament Hill on a
surprisingly dry course. Trevor,
despite trying to spike himself again
stormed to a good 16th place. He was
closely followed by Hubert and
captain Hugh. Thanks to everyone
who took part in the League.
Our honour was at stake in the
Hyde Park Relays. The orienteers
threw down the gauntlet and
challenged us to a private race within
the race. I'm pleased to say that we
saw off not only the orienteers but
also the old boys team, led by our
fitter-than-ever former secretary
Gavin Waterson. Even our second
team held off the orienteers! The
ladies team fought courageously but
had to settle for a lesser placing in a
truly high class race. The paramedics
had a peaceful day since Wimpey
decided not to collapse this year. Our
star performer on the day was Hubert
but everyone did well.
A few of us participated in the
National Cross Country
Championships, would you believe it,
in Nottingham. The younger lads,
Dave and Alex ran the junior race
which was won convincingly by
Simon Hugglestone. Dil ran the
9-mile senior race and easily won the
contest for the muddiest appearance.
Our finishing positions, withheld by
request, may have been far down the
list but it should be remembered that
the cream of the English cross-
country runners took part.
One week later Nottingham
University staged their annual relay
on a 2 mile plus course around the
campus, with two gruelling hills. IC
old boy Gavin ran a blinding leg in
13:14 but Hubert and Trevor were
close behind. Energetic Hubert
decided that one leg wasn't enough so
ran another leg just for fun! The
results were not known at the time of
writing.
Finally the club A G M will be at
5.00pm on Wednesday March 23.
More details on the noticeboard.
