Handwritten
signatures have
long been accepted
as unique to each
individual. Most
people can
recognise, and
distinguish
between, the
handwriting of
various friends and
relations. So it is
hardly surprising
that as far back as
Roman-times
people have tried to
deduce personality
from the
appearance of
handwriting.
Graphology is still a hotly debated
topic. Many people find it hard to
believe in—after all, writing is
produced by the movement of the
hand, and it seems that all it can
reveal would be skill or routine of the
hand muscles. And as most people
will have noticed, one's handwriting
can vary considerably from time to
time—how can anything so variable
show fundamental character traits?
Graphologists argue that even when
people use either hand, their toes, or
any other technique, their writing
shows the same recognisable
characteristics.
Whatever you may feel about the
way specific letter forms are said to
be linked to specific traits, graphology
is firmly believed in by numerous
people, some companies go as far as
hiring a graphologist to analyse the
handwriting of prospective
employees. Handwriting experts are
regularly called upon to determine
whether signatures and handwritten
documents are genuine or forced.
And there does seem to be definite
evidence linking the state of one's
handwriting with the state of one's
mind. The classic example of this is
seen in the signatures of President
Nixon during the Watergate scandal,
which gradually became more and
more like a straight line as the crisis
worsened.
As happens even in more
established sciences, there are as
many theories in graphology as there
are practitioners. Scanning through
the various books written about the
subject shows that though many basic
ideas are common to them all, the
details vary. To complicate matters
further, the same characteristics have
different meanings depending on what
other features the writing shows. A
deteriorating signature, for example,
may show increasing stress, or simply
that the person has had to sign his/her
name so often that he/she has become
increasingly casual about it.
The first book dealing with the
relationship between handwriting and
the character of the writer was
published by a Halion Professor of
Theoretic Medicine, Cavillo Baldi, in
1622. From this time the number of
treatises about the subject increased
steadily, until in the early nineteenth
century the systematic study of
handwriting was taken up by a group
of French clergy. One of these men
became the teacher of the French
abbot and novelist, Jean Hippolyte
Michan, who is aknowledged as the
founder of graphology as a science.
He worked from experience and
observation, comparing the
handwriting of people whose
characters he was familiar with and
determining common features. His
book, published in 1875, describes
almost all the signs and rules on which
graphology is still based. However,
he did not attempt to explain the
reasons for the production of these
signs.
The theory of graphology was
refined by a group of German
academics. In 1897 a graphological
periodical and a society for
graphological research were founded
by Hans Busse. Dr Ludwig Klages,
a major contributor to the periodical,
was the first to create a complete and
systematic theory of graphology,
based on the idea that writing is a
conflict between mental discipline and
natural rhythms. By analysing
changeable and unchangeable
elements of handwriting, he also
found a way to unravel disguised
writing. But his efforts had their
faults—for one thing his prejudices
about character left their stamp on his
theories, and he tended to look down
on the empirical work of French
graphologists so that the study became
based purely on theory.
It was left to two other men to fill
the main gaps in Klages' theory.
Robert Saudek, originally from
Czechoslovakia, specialised in the
effects of the various national styles
of handwriting. He was particularly
concerned with the study of English
handwriting and one of the most
important factors, speed. This
allowed for the first time all the
European graphological work to be
applied in England. The second
important idea, the link between
graphology and modern views on the
psychology of the unconscious, was
first worked on by Max Pulver, of
Switzerland. He emphasised the
problem of what the writing space
symbolises in the writer's mind.
Besides the general study of
writing, several more specialised
fields have been investigated. These
include the identification of
handwriting, the expression of sexual
character in handwriting, and the
effect of illness in handwriting.
Studies of graphology have not been
limited to Europe, or to serious
researchers. Among these English
'amateurs' who have added their
small contribution to the science, or
art, are the Brownings, Byron,
Gainsborough (the painter) and
Disraeli.
eanings
There are several basic tendencies
which are studied by graphologists:
the size and width of writing, the form
and degree of connection, the
regularity and speed, the fullness and
pressure, the angle of writing and any
right or left tendencies. It is essential
that if you try to analyse anybody's
handwriting, you must analyse all
tendencies and not just one. As with
body language, no general tendency
in handwriting, and no single sign, is
by itself adequate to judge a quality
in a man's character. Each tendency
has many meanings.

The size of a person's writing is often
an indicator as to how much space a
person is satisfied with. Large
handwriting is taken to mean that the
writer needs more space in his life;
small means that the writer can satisfy
himself in the space available to him:
Large:- objectivity, ambition, self-
confidence, enthusiasm, leadership,
desire to lead a good life, lack of
modesty, lack of tact, megalomania,
lack of accuracy, tendency to be a
poseur.
Small:- inferiority complexes,
obedience, accuracy, reliability,
