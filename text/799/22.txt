,,•;„£!• lS-lb- i r -I?
The DramSoc production of The
Physicists by Friedrich Diirrenmatt
was not just disappointing but also
embarrassing. Having seen many
student productions in my time,
including past DramSoc productions,
I can think of few which were so
lacking in direction and consistent
interpretation of the text. One minute
we were watching a farce, the next
a black comedy, the next a straight
play. There was no cohesion
whatsoever.
That is not to say that there were
no acceptable performances from the
cast. Vanessa Dodge, in particular, lit
up the stage whenever she appeared,
as did Steve Grabowski, though it was
his chest and not his acting ability
which had me transfixed.
Newton and Einstein made a
passable double act, especially
towards the end when they decided to
ham it up.
Alex Snelling, who played the lead
part of Mobius, kept it straight right
to the end. His performance suggested
that he could certainly act, but needed
a straight play to do it properly.
I am not surprised that the director
changed his name in the programme.
Walter Eaves singularly failed to do
any kind of justice to this play. He
messed about the script, failed to
impose any single interpretation of the
play on the cast and so did both the
cast, and more crucially the audience,
a disservice.

A peculiar
puzzle
When my girlfriend and I went to an
extraordinarily dull dinner party last
week, we found ourselves in the
company of four other couples. As
not everyone knew everyone else, we
were obliged to start the evening with
the formal ritual of introductions
which I'm sure you're familiar with.
'Do you know so-and-so?'
'How do you do?'
'Pleased to meet you.'
and so forth, accompanied by much
shaking of hands and false smiles and
offers of sherry.
There was then an embarrassing lull
followed by everyone trying to make
conversation at once:
'What do you do for a living?'
'Isn't the weather dreadful?'
'Who do you know here?'
Ad nauseam. It was this last
question which interested me, though,
as I discovered that, on previous
occasions, each of the others had met
a different number of those present.
Which left me the rest of the
evening to work out how many new
acquaintances my girlfriend made that
evening. How many?
