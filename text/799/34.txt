ELIX
JEWISH SOC
The Tuesday before last, March 8, the
last day of International Women's
Week, was specified as a day of
solidarity with women refuseniks,
who are unable to exercise their right
to leave their country. As part of such
a protest it was decided that at IC our
concerns for Galina Pilmenstein ought
to be relayed to the Soviet Embassy
in London. Galina (and her family)
have been refused exit visas from
Russia due to military secrets that, it
is claimed, her father knows, (from
the Russian army, fifteen years ago)
and might have relayed to her. So at
Imperial, we decided that Galina's
situation should be shared with the
masses.
Armed with the symbol of all IC
Soviet Jewry events, a plentiful
supply of After Eights chocolates, a
stall was set up in the JCR, attracting
many a passer-by. The Student and
Academic Campaign for Soviet Jewry
had announced that, considering that
many hundreds were fasting up and
down the country in support of
refuseniks, paper plates should be
used as stationery on which to write
to the Embassy. This went down very
well with the students approached,
and about seventy letters were written
within a short period of time. (Thank
goodness for After Eights!!)
The enthusiasm shown during this
past event will certainly allow us to
eagerly await an optimistic reply from
the Embassy—failing that, next term
will be seeing more eventful events.
If you feel you could help with the
campaign, please contact J Goldstein
(Chem 1).
cv soc
Now that ICU has Beetlesoc, why not
societies to promote other classic
cars? If anyone is interested in
forming CVsoc, in honour of the
Citroen 2CV and its many derivatives
the please contact James Breach,
Chemistry 2.
S&G
The final S & G weekend of the
Spring Term involved a party of
twelve visiting the Lake District. We
stayed in the Santon Bridge village
hall near Wast Water.
Saturday saw two parties starting
from Wasdale Head. The first
climbed Yewbarrow, Steeple and
Pillar. The second made their way up
FILMSOC
Sisterly lust
Term's nearly over so why not get
demob happy with Hannah and Her
Sisters!
Widely regarded as one of Woody
Allen's best films, it's the story of a
man's dilemma when he develops
adulterous impulses towards his
wife's sister. Combining deep
poignancy and hilarious comedy, the
film ranges from life to love to lust,
bringing the humour from the human
condition, making you laugh and cry.
An all star cast includes Michael
Caine who won an oscar for his
performance, Carrie Fisher, Max
Von Sydow and of course Woody
Allen himself. So if you want to see
seven of Mia Farrow's eight children
and the inside of her apartment make
a date for tomorrow. Thursday March
24 at 7pm in Mech Eng 220, only £ 1
to non members, 50p members. By
the way, how would you like to
choose next year's films and get into
them all free? If you're interested in
helping out running Filmsoc,
however little or much, come along
to any film and have a chat with one
of the committee, we don't bite (we
prefer to squeeze you to death).
Dancing Days
DANCE SOC
On Saturday March 12, a twenty
strong team travelled up to Liverpool
to compete in the biggest competition
in the dance calendar—the
Intervarsity Ball.
After a tiresome journey of five
hours, the Imperial clan shook the
fatigue from their legs and the
hairspray from their lungs and donned
their competition dress in readiness.
All couples danced well in their
individual events but once again the
mercy of the judges was not exactly
on our side.
Hugh Hamilton and Shuko
Noguchy (waltz) were unfortunately
knocked out in the first round but the
competition was particularly strong
and so there was no great disgrace in
this result.
Simon Denyer and Rachel Condor
(quickstep) danced in a controlled and
lively manner only to be robbed of a
place in the final by dubious judging.
Neil McCluskey and Dinah
Woodhurst (jive) came away with
second place after yet another exciting
performance of their routine.
The success story of the night was
the second place that Thomas Puetz
and Joanne Wade were awarded in the
cha-cha-cha. The incredible facial
technique of Thomas and his
continuous winking to the judges
worked in their favour, as did the
expressive way in which they both
danced.
Another pleasing result was the
fifth place which Thomas Puetz and
Rachel Condor got in the open samba
after only two lessons in that
particular dance. All that was missing
from this performance was a timely
slap around the face from Rachel,
perhaps next time.
The end of the evening saw the
offbeat entries performing to a new
set of judges who obviously were
either blind to dancing talent, or more
likely, preferred to see suspender-clad
girls rubbing themselves against
chairs than a truly entertaining
dance.
After winning convincingly at the
Southern Ball three weeks earlier
Imperial were not even placed in the
first three. Unbelieving onlookers
stood in stunned silence—a rather
unexpected end to the evening.
But on the whole this year has been
an enjoyable and successful one, and
much of this success has been due to
our wonderfully enthusiastic coach,
Victoria Cunniffe, for the second year
running she has been an inspiring
force behind all our couples and many
heart-felt thanks go out to her from
everyone she has taught this year.
A special mention must also go to
our president Gill Knowles who led
us through the harder times by
example and our wardrobe mistress
Dawn Fletcher who spent hours in
front of her sewing machine to make
sure that all our competitors were
immaculately turned out.
to Scafell Pike, taking in a good
scramble up Broad Crag. The cloud
stayed above 3000 feet all day and
conditions were acceptably dry.
However, as we sat drinking in the
pub that evening we were all asking
where was the snow?
Returning to Wasdale Head on the
Sunday revealed that the snow-line
had fallen to 2000 feet. A small party
had their scramble on Great Gable
ruined by this snow. However,
everyone else found excellent
conditions underfoot as they climbed
Scafell by Lord's Rake. Club ice-axes
were used but the experienced and
novice alike had an exhilarating
day—and perfect slope for glissading
was found on the top.
At last some decent snow was
found to end a dismal winter—we are
dreaming of a white one next year.
See you all in the Southside Upper
Lounge on any weekday lunchtime.
If you want to learn what S & G
does why not come to Mines B303 on
Thursday March 24 at 12.30pm to the
Chairman's annual review, with
slides?
