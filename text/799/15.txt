• This term started off with a cracker
of a story about Linstead's ill-fated
basement sale in December. What had
been thought as an obvious way to re-
organise the storage area in the Hall,
turned out to be an insurers nightmare
when several angry students tried to
reclaim their belongings which had
been sold several weeks beforehand.
It all began when Linstead Hall
Convenor Martin Whitfield suggested
that the basement area should be
cleared and any unwanted property
sold for charity and to raise funds for
the Hall's twentieth birthday party.
The Hall committee put up posters
and several small ads in FELIX to
announce the clearout and sale. Only
unmarked packages were opened,
with all the old clothes being donated
to Oxfam and valuable goods put
aside for sale. They found three
televisions, three stereos, ski boots,
a windsurfing outfit, a computer and
three bicycles which were all sold and
raised over a thousand pounds in the
process.
This was all very well for the Hall
committee and its party but several
other students were none to pleased
with the sale of their goods. It was
claimed that the organisers had
opened marked packages, as well as
those that were not marked, and not
put enough effort into finding the
original owners.
The outcome was that an enquiry
was held to stop such incidents
happening again, the party was a great
success and the College insurers are
still arguing about who should pay.
• Student accommodation has been in
the news several times this term.
Despite gaining Fisher Hall in Evelyn
Gardens, College administration will
not be able to guarantee all next year's
intake a room in a hall or house. The
situation was caused by the loss of
Rayleigh House, a house in Lexham
Gardens and a large chunk of Hamlet
Gardens residences. Rayleigh was
lost to provided the furnishing of the
new Evelyn Gardens hall, 54 Lexham
Gardens was found to be
overcrowded and not suitable
accommodation. Hamlet was the
same.
Fisher Hall may have been able to
take the loss if it were not for the fact
that College administration had
pushed Registry into providing more
places for overseas students to cover
the £ 3 m deficit the College had
acquired.
The Union and, in particular,
President Ian Howgate felt that they
had been misled by College when
they agreed to allow increased rents
to cover the purchase of Fisher. It was
easy to see that the students were
being asked to cover the cost just so
that admin could reduce its debt.
Things came to a head mid-term
when College asked the Union to
accepted bar increases of up to lOp
on a pint to cover the cost of refectory
refurbishment. If they didn't, College
said that the money would have to
come from another rent increase.
It was an impossible situation
brought on by the overlap of three
College accounts. Money could be
moved from the Residents Account to
the Conferences Account by allowing
Conferences re-let Summer
accommodation at a big profit. Any
money made by Conferences did not
go back to the Residents but was used
by the Catering Account. College
wanted to provide better facilities
such as the QT Burger outlet and
Belushis in Southside but the initial
investment had to be a large one. The
Union, concerned that so much
money was being spent on
refurbishment of the bars and food
outlets and not being ploughed back
into accommodation, felt trapped. At
the College's Bar Committee they
argued that savings could be made in
other areas.
The Union wanted more
information before allowing such an
increase. The plan was shelved.
• It is clear that most students will be
worse off after April 1st. Kenneth
Baker announced a 4% increase in the
grants next year and Nigel Lawson
reorganised the covenant system in
his March budget. The Conservative
NEWS
R E V I E W
would be a postgraduate only hall
following bitter ranglings between the
halls around Princes Gardens. It
seemed that Weeks was the ideal
choice until Vickers, the engineering
company who had provided the
funding for the Hall, expressed their
displeasure at the decision.
• The College was trying to raise
money in other ways. Administration
decided that money could be saved if
they de-centralised the Central Stores.
NALGO argued otherwise and a
bitter battle has been fought by the CS
staff to save the service.
• Meanwhile, IC Union and its music
societies were fighting the decision to
move the Music Room in 53 Princes
Gate to a terminal room in the
Government said that they were still
considering bringing in student loans.
Most students said that they had loans
already.
• It was announced that Weeks Hall
Computing Department because the
new Management School wanted the
space. Despite noisy protests
throughout the year, the move went
ahead and the music societies have
been told that if enough sponsorship
can be raised, the College will build
a new music block under the old
Holland Club! This came as a shock
to one or two people who had seen
the plans submitted to the local
council for that site. They consisted
of a function hall with a bar.
Interesting.
• Imperial College Union also went
through great changes this term.
Following a surprise restructuring of
the Union management at the
beginning of term, a new Union
Manager has been head-hunted from
ULU. The new Finance Officer also
joined the team this term. Critics of
the new organisation have said that
the Union is becoming too introverted
and more concerned with its own
running than with student issue.
President Ian Howgate, meanwhile,
believes it to be great step forward.
He is convinced that better
organisation will mean that more
student will want to get involved with
the Union and use its services.
• The merger with St Mary's is due
to take place in August. Their Union
voted to become the fourth
Constituent College Union of
Imperial College Union but not a
single ballot box for the sabbatical
elections was taken over to
Paddington.
• The elections came and went. The
results were predictable and the anti-
climax considerable. The whole thing
bored us silly.
• Ian Howgate provided some light
relief mid-term when he changed his
•name for charity to Sydney Harbour-
Bridge. He even managed to get
himself onto page 3 of The Sun.
That's where they put all the tits.
• FELIX came under some heavy fire
for being Howgatist.
• The Christian Union was thrown
out of ICU because of its constitution.
The C U demands that its members
should sign a statement of faith. The
Union demands that any ICU member
should have the right to join any of
its societies. They should not have to
sign any statements. The debate is still
going on as to whether exceptions
should be made in the case of
religious societies.
• Finally, the Union and the GERBIL
made the headlines at the beginning
of March when Imperial College went
on strike for a day. Over two
thousand IC students didn't go to
lectures on 1st March and a few even
went to lobby their MPs about the
Government's proposed Education
Reform Bill. Everybody thought the
whole exercise had been a great
success and it just goes to show that
the Union can be a political voice
when it wants to be. God forbid.
