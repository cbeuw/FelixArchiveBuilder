Those of you who promised features
for the science page had better get a
move on: there are only eight issues
of FELIX left this year. The Easter
holiday is a good time to get stuck in
to an article. You do want to be
famous don't you? You do want to get
your name in print? Honestly, it really
is good for you and it really isn't that
hard to do. Articles can be sent to me
via the Chemistry PG letter racks or
you can phone me on int 4642.
Stories illustrating Richard
Feynman's unique approach to things
continue to appear. Here is one I
found particularly worth repeating
since it shows Feynman himself
putting all his great achievements in
physics into perspective. The source
of the story is Marcus Chown, who
is Reviews Editor for New Scientist.
The first science progamme that
Marcus Chown's mother ever
watched was the Horizon profile on
Feynman. She seemed very interested
in him, even though she had never
shown any other interest in science
despite her son's constant attempts to
explain physics to her.
Later, when Chown was at
CalTech, he thought of the useful
idea: he would ask Feynman to write
to his mother in the hope that this
would prompt her to be more
receptive to his explanations of
science. He had never spoken to
Feynman before, but he knew,
somehow, that he wouldn't reject the
idea as trivial.
He was right, Feynman duly posted
a letter, but this is what it said: 'Dear
Mrs Chown, ignore your son's
attempts to teach you physics. Physics
isn't the most important thing. Love
is. Best wishes, Richard Feynman.'
Marcus Chown told the story to
illustrate Feynman's character and he
didn't think it was particularly
profound. But I think that it is both
profound and moving: the first time
I read it I cried.
Following
brains as they
work
If William of Ockham was a saint he
would be the patron saint of scientists
(unfortunately he was excom-
municated for heresy). He was the
14th century theologian who invented
the principle that the simplest
explanation must be the best one
(though he wasn't expelled from the
church for this but for his adherence
to Fransiscan vow of absolute
poverty—the 14th century Vatican
wasn't too keen on poverty).
Ockham laid the intellectual
foundations for modern science by his
espousal of the principles of
empiricism and reductionism.
Modern science has been ruthlessly
reductionist. To find out how
complicated things work, we have
tended to chop them up into smaller
things that are easier to understand.
This has been an immensely
successful technique in the physical
sciences. The ten million or so known
chemicals can be chopped into the 100
or so elements which can, in turn, be
divided into protons, electrons and
neutrons, and so on.
This technique has not proved so
wonderfully useful in the life
sciences. There, reductionism often
gets in the way of progress: it is
difficult to understand how an animal
works by chopping it into pieces, as
animals tend to stop working when
they are chopped up. We find it
difficult to understand how brains
work (even though we understand the
bits well) because the whole is more
than the sum of its parts. Biologists
are, eventually, moving away from
reductionist methods and are starting
to look at things as a whole.
This brings me (belatedly) to the
subject of this story: a new technique
for studying how whole brains work
that doesn't involve chopping them
up. The technique is called 'Positron
Emission Tomography' (PET for
short), but it's not as painful to do as
it is to pronounce. It has already
caused a stir among brain scientists
by short circuiting some of their
previous theories.
The method involves injecting the
subject with radioactive water (the
radioactivity only lasts for several
minutes and the amounts involved are
safe—less radiation is involved than
in conventional medical X-rays). The
emission can be detected and a map
of where the radioactive water has
gone can be made from the
information. The parts of the brain
that work hardest use more water, and
the radioactive oxygen accumulates
there. This enables scientists to tell
what parts of the brain are used for
certain activities.
The recent work involves a study
of how we convert reading into
speech. Previously it was thought that
we convert the visual image into its
spoken equivalent, then look it up in
a dictionary to see what it means and
only then pass it to the speech centre
to be vocalised. PET shows that no
dictionary stage is needed: we convert
scribblings directly into sounds.
However, the area of the brain that
is active in converting writing into
sounds is different from the area
involved in actually understanding
what is written. Perhaps this should
have been obvious from the behaviour
of politicians.
The group are now working on the
study of more complicated tasks.
Their work may prove useful in
aiding brain surgery in cases of
injury. Significantly, their work
represents a technique that allows
study of the whole brain without
having to dissect it. The sort of
answers that they are getting should
be far more useful than the
reductionist models of brain action
common at present.
Deadly veg
I always get annoyed when people
complain about chemical additives in
food. Most of them are there for a
good reason and have been
thoroughly tested for safety. The
same cannot be said for some of the
naturally occurring chemicals present
in perfectly ordinary foodstuffs.
Recently a group of chemists have
spotted some particularly nasty
compounds in the celery, parsnip and
carrot family.'
The effects of these chemicals was
first seen during the First World War
when a group of soldiers in France
were taken severely ill after loading
some supplies into the truck. Initially
the symptoms were mistaken for
mustard-gas poisoning (the Germans
had just started to use gas as a
weapon). But it turned out that the
symptoms were the result of handling
vegetables suffering mild fungal
infections.
Recently chemists have been
investigating the chemicals that cause
the trouble. The particular group of
compounds involved (with names
such as psoralen, angelicin and
coriandrin) are produced by some
plants in response to stress such as
physical damage or fungal infection.
The compounds act by interfering
with nucleic acids and hence DNA
replication. They are at their worst in
the presence of sunlight which excites
the molecules enabling them to cause
severe genetic damage and virtually
prevent cell repair or replication in the
invader. Unfortunately the chemicals
rub off onto anyone who handles the
vegetables. The resulting symptoms
are rather like some chemical
weapons. There are few regulations
requiring cancer-testing on fresh
vegetables, but there may soon be a
case for it, as these natural nasties
outclass most of the ones developed
by man in deliberate attempts to make
deadly compounds. If the vegetables
are in good condition, there is not
usually a problem, but concentrations
of the nasties shoot up when the
vegetables have been damaged. I'm
taking my rubber gloves home from
the lab to use in my kitchen.
