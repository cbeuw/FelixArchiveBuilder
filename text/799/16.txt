And now for something completely the same
After six months of
intense, and often
suicidal,
negotiations, the
Social and Liberal
Democratic Party
has been launched.
Who will be the
leader of the new
party? And how
will it differ from
the old Alliance
parties? Andrew
Waller, FELIX
staff reporter,
investigates.
To outsiders it would seem strange
that two parties which had just fought
a General Election on a joint platform
of policies and looked as if merger in
the long or short term was inevitable
could come to blows about the
question of a formal link up. On the
whole the Liberal party has been
enthusiastic about the merger, both
assemblies voted by huge margins to
accept the merger, and all seventeen
MPs have joined the SLDP. Merger
has split the SDP. Three of their tiny
band of five MPs (not enough for
their leader to lay a wreath at the
cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday)
have decided not to join the new
party. Dr Owen and company have
set up their own headquarters and
have substantial financial backing.
When Dr Owen suffered defeat in the
SDP Ballot last year he resigned, and
thus the unknown Robert MacLennan
became leader. Initially 'Bob' had
been against the merger; however the
mood of the party changed most
markedly at the Portsmouth
conference last September when the
merger motion (proposed by the only
other pro-merger, MP Charles
Kennedy) was passed. Since then the
Owenites have largely concentrated
their efforts on setting up their own
party. They have always had a
constitutional blocking vote as a %
majority was needed in the Governing
Council for Social Democracy.
However, the Owenites commented
that it would not do anyone any good
to 'trap' people in the, SDP and so
refrained from voting at the Council
for Social Democracy. The Owenites
claim still to be the SDP. However,
can the party be the same party as the
SDP of the last general election when
the majority of members and
councillors have left? The question of
the logo is a very contentious issue.
Legally there seems to be little to stop
the Owenites from continuing to use
it.
So what of the future of the Social
and Liberal Democrats? At the
moment the party leaderless although
the timetable for the leadership
elections in which all party members
will vote has been brought forward
to this summer. David Steel is by far
the most popular choice. However, he
has indicated that he would like to see
a new leader. Paddy Ashdown (MP
for Yeovil) seems the next choice. A
former member of the naval
equivalent of the SAS, he has
charisma and charm. He did mix with
The anti-nuclear elements of the
Liberal Party but clearly supported
David Steel in the 1986 defence
debate at Eastbourne. Apart from
Paddy Ashdown there are several
possibles including Alan Beith (MP
for Berwick-upon-Tweed), former
Liberal deputy leader Malcolm Bruce
(MP for Gordon) and Alex Carlisle
(Montgomery). Nothing rules out ex-
SDP leader Rober MacLennan but he
has taken too long to become even
vaguely known to the electorate.
It would seem reasonable to assume
that the new party may regain some
of the electoral support it lost during
the bitter fighting. Since the General
Election its standing in the national
opinion polls has halved from 25%
(June 1987) to around 12%. A MORI
poll in the Sunday Times indicated
that support had risen to 14% (up 2%
on last January). A Harris Poll
published in the Observer on the same
day put support for the break-away
Owenites at 2%. At first sight 2%
seems a pitiful amount for a party to
hope to continue, however in 1951 the
Liberal Party dipped to 2.5% yet still
had six MPs. However four of these
seats had no Conservative opposing
candidate—but there would be
nothing to stop the Tories from
'assisting' the election of at least Dr
Owen as it could be to their
advantage.
In the months since the last set of
District Elections in May 1987 the
Alliance has lost 23 seats. However,
it has in one form or another gained
twenty seats and on the day the press
launch was held, the new party—the
SLDP—took a seat from the
Conservatives on Avon County
Council. Indeed the true potential of
the SLDP will be tested in the next
Parliamentary by-election (or possibly
next May's District Elections).
Relations between the SLDP and
Owenite SDP will be sorely tested. Dr
Owen is in danger of being seen as
a spoiler; by putting up candidates
against SLDP candidates he could
wipe out any recovery. The chances
of an electoral pact seem minimal
given the intransigence on both sides.
Already Dr Owen, in a BBC
interview, has accused the SLDP
party of having no policies. However,
policy leaflets for the new party have
already been published, and all new
members of the SLDP will receive a
membership pack including brief
policy statements which largely draw
from the document used for the
general election with commitments to
N A T O , devolution, (surprise,
surprise) proportional representation,
increased spending on the NHS and
education, and increased industrial
democracy. After the events
surrounding the merger the general
public will be less willing to sample
something new than they were in
1981 when the SDP was formed.
Defence will be a potential stumbling
block, as the General Election
commitment to scrapping Trident will
have to be re-examined by 1991 (the
likely date of the next general
election). It will have been
substantially paid for and will
probably be ready to be deployed, and
there may have been a shift in East-
West relations.
The organisation of the new party
will be based on parliamentary
constituencies, nationally making up
ten regions (excluding the Party in
Scotland and Wales which will be
separate). This resembles the former
Liberal Party structure. However the
federal assembly which is the
governing body of the party will be
more strictly regulated. Memories of
the Eastbourne defence vote die hard.
