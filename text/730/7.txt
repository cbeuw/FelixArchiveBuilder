What's It all About?
As an ardent SF fan, people
frequently ask me certain
questions (well maybe not, but
it's one way to start an article).
The most common of these
goes along the lines of 'Why
do you like reading all that
juvenile stuff about Bug Eyed
Green Monsters and silly ray
guns?' I usually have two
answers for this question. One
is very short, consisting of two
words, one of which is 'off.
Since this reply would not
improve our image among the
esteemed readers of this
publication I shall now resort
to my second, longer answer.
SF (not sci-fi, an abreviation
all time fans loathe) as we
know it today has its roots in
two very different places. The
one most people think of is
the 'pulp' American magazine
of the thirties and forties,
famous for what many people
now associate with Science
fiction - bug eyed monsters,
ray guns, phallic spaceships
and all that. Indeed it is the
ghost of the pulps that still
haunts us. The other form of
proto-SF is the much more
respectable 'Science
Romances' of H G Wells, Olaf
Stapledon and other
Englishmen of the period
between the World Wars. Their
tales were far more
intellectually stimulating and
of much greater literary ability.
They dealt with real questions
of political, philosophical or
human interest. Wells' The
Time Machine or Stapleton's
Last and First Men are prime
examples. Indeed the latter is
still regarded by many as
being both the finest SF ever
written and the best piece of
literature to come out of
England between the wars.
FELIX
What became of these
English bastions of SF
literature? Well, they died. For
many years all the SF that
remained was in the style of
American pulp. At this point,
in the 40's and 50's Hollywood
got hold of pulpish SF and
filmed it, producing what most
people think of as the
archetypical SF film —
distinctive features being bad
story, cheap effects, lack of
characterization, totally
unorganised etc. etc.
However, while Hollywood
was butchering SF's public
image, the writers were getting
their act together and
producing some decent stuff.
In the US such authors as
Silverberg, Pohl, Sheckley and
Leiber started to drag SF up
from the sorry state it was in.
Then in the 60's, England the
so called New Wave authors,
like Moorcock, Aldiss and
Ballard started producing
work which was as good or
better than contemporary
literature. J G Ballard last year
nearly won the Booker Prize,
and Mike Moorcock has been
praised so highly by modern
critics that you'd think he was
the greatest living writer.
Some people might agree.
Since then the ghetto walls
surrounding SF have
continued to fall, and it is no
longer a separate and
'worthless' art form. It's a pity
the film makers and TV
producers still think they live
in the so called Golden Age of
SF, when E E 'Doc' Smith
spacesships ruled the
subspace lanes and Q-beams
fried the vile slimy aliens, the
days when men were men and
women did what they were
told.
These days are over, and SF
is set to conquer the literary
universe!
Friday 7
The other question I'm
frequently asked this time of
year, (and this one isn't just a
way of getting an article
going) is 'what's happening at
PICOCON?' For those of you
who don't know, P I C O C O N is
SF SOC's own mini-
convention. This is a gathering
of people interested in SF
(though that's not obligatory)
to see SF Films, hear speakers
(authors or generally
interesting people) and play
competitions of a generally SF
nature. One thing we're doing
this year, which we are
especially pleased about, is
showing videos of old TV
programmes. SF on televisions
is occasionally very well done,
and almost always disappears
once you've seen it, never to
return again. Also, since many
people were first introduced to
Science Fiction by television,
they have pleasant memories
of TV programs from their
youth. At P I C O C O N and a
secret event planned later this
term, you'll get to see some of
your favourite TV Science
Fiction. So, without further
ado, here is the P I C O C O N
timetable. Oh and another
thing, P I C O C O N 4 is on all
day Saturday 15th Feb in the
Union Dining Hall and S C R . It
starts at 10am and continues
for at least 12 hours at the
bargain price of £2.50. Here is
the programme of events,
hope to see you there.
