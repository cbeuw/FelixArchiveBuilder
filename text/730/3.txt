Murray
Misguided
Dear Sir,
It is interesting to note that
the 'author' of the 'article'
misguidedly filed under the
Arts (FELIX 31/1/86) should
only obscurely have
provided his name. A desire
for anonymity is usually
associated with such
hysterical ravings;
particuarly when it exhibits
itself as the ignorant and
offensive 'article'
masquerading as opinion,
that I assume was intended
to contribute to a balanced
discussion of sexism at
Imperial College.
An opinion whose
content is more
irreconcilable with its
section title can never have
been written. The views
espoused were so extreme
and so inimical to art, that
they become almost an
'anti-art' statement. Indeed,
it is nearly suggested that
any art form that
contravenes Mr Murray's
sexist arbitration is a
blemish that should be
eliminated-a sacrifice that
would seem to include
most artistic works, judging
by the unbalanced nature
of his opinions thereon.
Such sentiments could
be defensible were their
feebleness not
compounded by a crass
ignorance on the subject of
art and a strange inability
to distinguish between art
and sexism. We are
unaware of any Hemingway
novel written in the style
parodied-a parody which
reveals more about the
author's unhealthy sexism
obsession than Hemingway
as an author. However, we
are prepared to admit a
hiatus in our knowledge
not having read everything
Hemingway published.
Even so, if Hemingway had
written anything in such a
style, it is simply stupid,
and literarily indefensible,
to make the implication
that this criticism extends
to such books as 'For
Whom the Bell Tolls' and
'The Old Man and The Sea',
to name but two.
We agree that the
offensive innuendo in
Heavy Metal Lyrics is
disturbingly sexist. But to
equate Heavy Metal with
Carmina Burana is naive at
best, while at worst it
suggest that we are dealing
with a Caliban whose
vestigal intellect has
deserted him. (As an aside,
for your enlightenment Mr
Murray, Caliban is a
character in Shakespeare's
'The Tempest'. We suggest
you try reading it: it does
have some mono-syllabic
words and you might be
able to cope with these).
Mr Murray's claims that
most of the 'heavy' classics
are 'genitally (does he
mean sexually) oriented'
further exposes the flaws in
his arguments. The
example of Orff's Carmina
Burarn, with a quote whose
source is unacknowledged,
shows his complete lack of
familarity with the work.
Jeffrey Duban's translation
of the 12th and 13th
century songs that forms
the work, require
substantial imagination on
the part of the singer to
decide what might have
been written 'Between the
lines'. It is in the final part
(The Court of Love) where
there are 'forthright' lines,
May one and all the gods
consent
To grant my spirit's fond
intent
That she departs my
company
Unchained from her
virginity.
Which We assume is Mr
Murray's 'rape of virgins'.
It is supposedly, on the
basis of this pitiful evidence
supporting such prejudiced
ideas that all members of
all societies are expected to
be conscious of 'potential'
sexism in their actions.
What he has failed to
consider is that anonymous
abuse of, for example
Carmina Burana, to further
the 'macho' image in such
TV adverts as Old Spice,
and the recent series of BL
adverts. Mr Murray would
subject everyone to the
same mind-numbing
rigidity which so manifest
in his arguments. Dante
pictured Hell as a frozen
lake where emotion died:
Mr Murray seems to want
Earth to be similarly frozen
lake where thought has
died.
The continual
degeneration to the
thoughtless sloganeering of
'penial orientation' and
'phallic symbolism' is
indicative of the author's
own alarming obsession.
The ultimate desire for
censorship, that might even
consign Sappho to the
same indignity (even she
had her hymenal
moments), is typical of
some people's rabid
fananticism which totters
on the fringe of an
Orwellian nightmare. And
in their desparation to
achieve an 'equitable life',
they seem to be quite
happy to justify, and
indulge in, ritual book
burning and elimination of
individuals in their pursuit
of ideological and
intellectual purity.
We do not consider
ourselves to be sexists: we
are strongly opposed to the
sexual exploitation inherent
in Hon Porn night. But if
the Murray alternative is
the price of non-sexism,
then we want no part of it.
Yours faithfully

Seymour
Slammed
Dear Hugh,
Having read Mr Spock's
synopsis on Mr Seymour,
I'd just like to add that
anyone who wears a 'jacket
and tie' to a totally pathetic
hole such as BANANA'S
deserves to be spat on.
Yours sincerely
James E Kirk
PS Maybe Mr Seymour
should send a bunch of
pansies to the bouncer as a
gesture of goodwill.
Cave Canoe
Respond
Dear Ed,
I am glad to see that at
last minority sports are
getting a mention in your
wonderful rag. I am, of
course, referring to last
week's article on Cave
Canoe Football. Although
not a popular sport it is one
in which Britain can hold
its head up high and say
we are number 1, unlike so
many others.
Despite the very exciting
prose, the article did in fact
fail to make a few things
clear. Firstly C C F is not an
all male sport but one for
both sexes and if it were
not for a bad knee the team
would undoubtably have
had a female geologist in
the side. Next the sport is
not as dangerous or
vicious, despite Morris 'the
Refrigerator' Culclough's
unforgivable behavior, as
made out.
Finally I would again like
to compliment FELIX on
seeing the light,
With gratitude,
Dave Willis
