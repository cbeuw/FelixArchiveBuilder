It's always nice to meet
someone you admire, but
even more so when the
person lives up to the
image. When I spoke to
Anthony Hopkins as he was
filming The Good Father
lor channel 4, he was
exactly the gracious,
charming and articulate
actor you might expect.
Very polished, very
professional. You could see
that he had done dozens of
interivews in the past and
would be doing dozens
more in the future, and yet
rev
i g i n t h e N e w s .
he was willing to humour
me and to have a chat.
We talked about the
United States where he has
worked for the last ten
years. The two cities where
he had spent the most time
in were New York and Los
Angeles — both of which
he quite enjoyed despite
them being so different. Of
New York he said little
more than the classic one
line 'I love NY', but he
cheerfully described LA as
a 'Mickey Mouse town'
where one had to 'know
how to play the game'. You
may have seen him last
term in the fun but awful
Hollywood Wives which Mr
Hopkins described as his
attempt to prevent himself
being seen as a 'respected
British stage actor'. He
ignores the cultural snobs
who condemn him for that
kind of work and said that
they simply have 'no sense
of humour'.
Although he has done a
lot of excellent work, not all
of it can be described as
good. He explained this by
the simple phrase, 'I love
working' — and I suppose
that is more important than
anything. Whether he is
doing Hollywood Wives,
The Elephant Man, or
Pravda the point is that he
is earning a living in the
career he enjoys. Although
he obviously would prefer
to appear in good
televison/films/theatre, he
doesn't take himself too
seriously and dislikes
people hassling him about
his work. Some directors
have, he said, too much of
a sense of their own
importance. In the end, it's
only entertainment.
It is for this reason that
he enjoys doing
programmes such as
Wogan. He admits honestly
(unlike many other actors, I
might add) that he loves
publicity. By the very
nature of the job, an actor
has decided he wants to be
in the public eye. Those
who shy away from
publicity he described as
either 'silly' or 'hypocritical'.
D e a d l i n e fever encourages taut,
crisp writing with a m a x i m u m of
facts a n d a m i n i m u m of frills ...
F o r a story about, say, an old lady
w h o was flushed with
embarrassment as a result of
being locked in a t o w n hall
lavatory, a n d the consequent
chain reaction w h e n the council
tried to get to the bottom of it, at
least four hours should be
allowed. F o r a late-night train
crash k i l l i n g 100 people, allow
twenty minutes.

In some ways it was quite
bizarre chatting to Anthony
Hopkins. He seemed, for
example, very interested
when I explained what
Imperial College was and
told me that he had always
been very interested (but
never good) in Physics.
This one might not have
expected. But seeing him
on stage in the National
Theatre's Pravda was a real
shock. By the wonders of
superb stage acting he
managed to turn the
charming and intelligent Mr
Hopkins into the slightly
mad genius and Afrikaaner,
Lambert Le Roux.
Pravda is a Fleet Street
comedy written by David
Hare (Plenty) and Howard
Brenton [The Romans in
Britain). The plot centres
around the struggle
between Andrew May (Tim
Mclnnery) and Le Roux.
Kate Buffery, May's wife,
represents the forces of
good while Le Roux
represents the force of evil.
Almost all the characters,
except Rebecca May and
May's best friend are
characatures (with
ridiculous names to match)
whereas May himself
changes from a person to a
cartoon and back again as
the battle takes hold.
Anthony Hopkins and Bill
Nighy (who plays Le
Roux's Australian sidekick,
Eaton Sylvester) both use
body language to convey
much of their respective
characters.
By the clever use of the
appropriate walks and
stances, the cartoons come
alive and beautifully
theatrical. At the climax of
the play the stance that had
been the trademark of Le
Roux throughout the play
is taken to such lengths
that he turns into a snake
before our eyes (perhaps
symbolic of the snake who
tempted Adam and Eve?)
Very well done indeed.
This show, which has
already won much
deserved critical acclaim
(and, indeed, awards) is
stunning. The acting is a
joy, and the play itself is
tight and well written.
Anthony Hopkins has
himself won awards for his
portrayal of Lambert Le
Roux. He may have gone to
the States for ten years to
get away from the
'respected British stage
actor' label, but whether he
likes it or not, he's got it
back...with interest.
