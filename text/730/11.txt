8th position. The B team
reached a respectable 20th
and the C team thoroughly
enjoyed themselves
propping up the bottom of
the list.
The three teams were T
Williams, A Lee, M Neville,
V Gaskell M Cooper, A
Badani, P Bawles, S

I Sturm and Natasha.
Three teams were entered
in the British Universities
Bridge Congress and
achieved varying degrees
of success.
In the pairs event 3 pairs
reached the finals and the
rest qualified for a
consolation final. However,
luck was not with us this
time and mediocre
performances were
displayed by all four, none
achieving their true
potential and most finished
in the middle of their
respective fields.
Much was expected from
the P team, being one of
the strongest teams and
possibly the best team to
represent IC in recent
years. The final round saw
the team well placed in
third position (out of 50),
however a disappointing
performance led to losing
the round and dropping to

Slumped in his chair, the
writer sighed and pushed
his glasses further up his
nose. He sighed again and
pushed his nose further up
his face. It was going to be
one of those meetings.
Shortly the chairman rose
(slowly, to avoid
nosebleeds), adjusted his
appliance and began to
speak:
'Ladies and gentlemen,'
he said, 'Welcome to this
week's Q T meeting. At this,
three naked Lithrenian

Young Disabled On Holiday
Everyone likes a holiday.
For many people it is just a
simple question of picking
up a phone or visiting a
local travel agent, and time
and money considered,
they can go anywhere they
want.
For some people who are
physically handicapped it is
not so straightforward.
Often an able bodied
helper is needed to assist
them to get out and about,
and make the most of extra
opportunities a holiday
provides. Naturally to meet
these demands, several
organisations have been
formed to cater solely for
holidays for the physically
handicapped. Nearly all of
them are registered
charities (ie non-profit
making) and are run by
volunteers.
One charity in particular is
'Young Disabled on
Holiday' (YDH). It
organises group holidays
for 16-30 year olds, lasting
usually for one week. Not
only does it give the
disabled person a holiday,
it also gives the people who
normally look after the
disabled person (often
relatives) a welcome break.
YDH is now entering its
16th year and so far has
offered 70 holidays ranging
from boating to a fortnight
in America, to camping in
Germany to Christmas in
Guildford(!) to Lanforce
and all the possibilities in
between.
On all these holidays
each physically disabled
person has at least one
able-bodied helper who
provides assistance
depending on the extent of
the disability. This will vary
from tying shoelaces,
walking up and down stairs
to full physical care ie
washing, toilet, feeding etc.
A sense of humour is
essential.
It can be very demanding
on helpers but always very
satisfying and experienced
helpers are always on hand
when necessary and
usually when not. The
emphasis is always to have
as much fun as possible
since it is a holiday.
It also guarantees to
provide a valuable and
unforgetable experience!
Inevitably the limited age
group means we are always
looking for new people, but
in particular helpers. T o
tempt people, Y D H plan the
following holidays in 1986:
Jersey at Easter, Russia
in May, Camping in Paris
July, Exeter in August,
Tunisia in September.
Finances are always a
problem and since helpers
are charged a fraction of
the cost of the Holiday, we
are continually fundraising.
To this end we hope to
hold a sponsored 12 hour
Disco in College on 22/23
March, at 8pm-8am to raise
funds. Experienced Y D H
people will be there and,
we hope, as many other
people as possible. For
more details on any fund
raising and more

cheered, clapped and threw
small pieces of fish, which
the chairman deftly caught
in his mouth.
'At the weekend out
infamous 'Donald' stunt
was performed in Hyde

good time was had by all.
So, if there is nothing
further to add, that's it'

Cycling
This week we went to visit
the folks in Windsor Castle,
but they wouldn't let us in,
so we settled for Old
MacDonalds. After a quick
tour of Windsor when we
got split up, we regrouped

face the wind on the
homeward journey.
Fortunately it had dropped
and we were soon back in
the traffic and fumes of
Central London. Sunday
