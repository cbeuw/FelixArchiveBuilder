Pennies
This week I've got an
interesting two player game
which I'd like you to think
about. The players
alternate by putting regular
sized pennies down onto a
square table, the pennies
may not overlap one
another and may not cross
the edge of the table. The
loser is the first person who
cannot place a penny on
the table. None of the
pennies already placed on
the table may be moved at
any point.
.There is a good strategy
to this game such that if
you know it, and your
opponent doesn't, you can
probably win. I say
'probably' because it has
one flaw. What I'd like to
know is, what is the
strategy? What is its flaw?
Who will win if both players
know the strategy? And is
the shape of the table
important?
Answers, plus comment
etc by Tuesday lunchtime
for the £5 prize. I'd like to
thank my friend Juan for
supplying this week's and
last week's problem-thanks
Juan.
Tricky Triangles
All the answers I got this
week, except for one,
claimed that it was
impossible to divide up an
obtuse triangle into a finite
number of acute triangles,
and they all provided neat
proofs or arguments. Well
done. The problem is that it
is possible. The trick is to
cut off two ends of the
triangle and form a
pentagon with the
remainder, as shown (it is
not necessrily a regular
pentagon).
This can be done for any
obtuse triangle. The proof
of this is long and boring
so I wont give it here, but
try finding a triangle for
which this doesn't work.
The correct answer was
from spock, who isn't
eligible for the prize
anyway, as he is a FELIX
Megahero—the price of
stardom, eh?
