o
Called To The
Bar
The Union Bar Is known as the place where rugby
players drop their trousers and sing obscene songs. It
Is also known as the place where hacks gather and
Ordinary students are not welcome. FELIX writer (and
tee-totaller) Sunny Bains went to work in the Bar one
evening In an attempt to see If It lives up to its
reputation.
In a way I'm sorry to
have to admit it, but I like
the Union Bar. The night I
chose to work there it was
full of noisy, drunken men
and women, and I honestly
didn't mind it too much.
As everyone knows, quiet
drinking is impossible in
the Union Bar for about
half the week. This however
should eventually change
with the opening of a
refurbished Lounge Bar,
which the Union has
promised is on the way
(when the money is
available and we have the
Union Bar licence). But
between now and then it is
important not to avoid
drinking in the Union Bar.
Although excessive
behaviour does sometimes
take place, and clothes are
removed from time to time,
normally it really isn't that
bad.
I must admit that when I
was asked to work at the
Bar and chose Wednesday
night to do it, I had some
preconceptions of what it
was going to be like.
Although the rugby song
lyrics were not for the
squeamish, I didn't find the
atmoshpere particularly
sexist (except for the fact
that some men commented,
rightly, on my
incompetance as a
bartender).
The more valid criticism
about the Bar, is that it is a
'hacks bar'. To be honest,
this is not the fault of the
Bar Manager or the 'hacks'
themselves. If other
students do not make an
effort to see what the Bar is
like under Union control
and stay away because of
rumours they've heard,
then nothing will change.
Moore Lyttle is trying very
hard to make the Bar into a
place for all students, and
he should be given a
chance. The staff are
competent and friendly
(except when I was there
as I was incompetant, and
periodically quite rude),
and there are promotions
on every week, including
'Happy Hours' when some
beers are 50p a pint. You
owe it to yourself and your
Union to at least try the
Bar.
Its financial importance
to the Union is quite
significant. If money is lost
on the Bar, then there will
be less money to spend on
the Union clubs. Financial
success, on the other hand,
will mean a refurbishment
of the Lounge Bar and
therefore a drinking place
which should appeal to a
larger number of students -
the choice is yours.
Tom Melliar-Smith is
homeless and looking for a
bed (whether occupied or
not) in which to spent the
night. Salty Tom
discovered, to his dismay,
that his family had moved
from their house in
Eastbourne to a much
smaller flat, and that there
was no longer any room at
the inn. As tempting as Mr
Melliar-Smith may be girls,
I wouldn't take up his
proposition to readily...
never fool around with an
/Ffily married man.
Refectory Manager
Norman Jardine seems to
have been having his own
problems sleeping recently.
Norman Nutburger lives
next door to wacky
Academic Affairs Officer J
Martin Taylor. In the last
few weeks Mr Jardine has
been kept awake by loud
groans coming from Mr
Taylor's room. On one
occasion the groans were
so loud that he left his
room to see who was being
murdered. Fortunately,
though, before he could
break into Mr Photocopier's
room the groans became
giggles with a definite
American accent.
So how many of you won
Â£5 last week in FELIX?
Sorry about the
disappointment but as you
will already have heard, the
University College rag (Pi)
decided that they couldn't
take a bit of criticism and
so they raided us. Frankly, I
was quite flattered that they
should take anything I say
so seriously, but
nevertheless FELIX felt its
honour had been put in
question and so decided it
had to retaliate.
Unfortunately the FELIX
return raid was infinitely
less successful than the
orginal. On Monday
morning, at the crack of
dawn, several members of
the FELIX staff tried to put
inserts in this weeks Pi. Pi,
however, had not been
published on schedule
because of computer
failure and so the merry
raiders had to get back to
IC with only the
satisfaction of a job well
botched. Even more
ridiculous was the fact that
they tried again the next
day, this time only
marginally more
successfully. When they
got up to the offices and
print unit at the Union
Building they discovered
that there was still no sign
of any Pi in the pipeline.
Paste-ups and printing
plates were noticably
missing, as was the mess
that usually accompanies
any collating. A couple of
back copies of Pi were
found, however, and it was
this that made the trip
worthwhile. By looking
through them it became
obvious that, even for the
most up to date issues of
PI, my criticisms (and
praises) still stand...
Well, since certain people
don't love me any more
(Tony, I love him more than
you, please don't be bitter)
I'd best stop right here.
Except to ask: which C C U
president is asking for a
budget increase of more
than 100% this year?
(Mines silly!).
Well, lots of love you
gerriatrics.. and remember:
regularity is all important in
sex, healthy living and
Newspaper Publishing.
