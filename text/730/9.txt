Dennis Potter's story for
Dreamchild is as charming
as might be expected.
When I went to the press
showing the audience,
largely comprising elderly
film critics (most of them
are) clapped at the end,
this is virtually
unprecedented. In fact the
polite clapping of the
audience is in keeping with
the nature of the film, an
essay on the researched
and repressed English.
In the film the 'real' Alice,
of Alice in Wonderland
fame, is now 80 and is
travelling to New York to
join in the Lewis Carroll
centenary celebrations at
Colombia University. On
arrival she is wholly
unprepared for the free and
easy ways of the Americans
and also for the attentions
of the media.
The American
characteristics are
embodied by the slick
reporter, Jack Daooan,
played by Peter Gallagher,
the weakest of the excellent
cast, whose unashamed
arrogance and charm
finally wins over Alice and
allows him to become her
business manager. His
scheming causes some
upset to Alice's young
companion, Lucy, who
feels that she has been
used. Nicola Cowper
performs extremely well as
the shy naive English girl
shocked into independence
by the new surroundings
and behaviour.
All the attention she
receives because of her
association with the Alice
in Wonderland causes Alice
to confront all the
suppressed childhood
memories of the Reverand
Charles Dodgson (Lewis
need to escape: 'troubles
can't always be cured.'
'Sometimes you have to
drea'm'-Potter then further
goes on to expound the
importance of fantasy and
how too much detailed
knowledge can spoil the
dream. For example when
Mrs Hargreaves is
describing how young
children should behave she
says that they should have
'good light for reading, so
as not to damage the eyes,
but not completely remove
I M

Carroll) and the
Wonderland characters
who return to haunt her in
a malevolent form. This
malevolence is cleverly
realised in the appearance
of the Mad Hatter and Hare
particularly, just two of the
many creatures made for
the film by Jim Henson of
Muppets fame.
Dennis Potter's script
skillfully handles both the
repression of Lewis Carroll,
another brilliant
performance from Ian H o l m ,
and his relationship with
the young Alice, again a
fine performance by Amelia
Shakley, and also the
English reserve and
understatement epitomised
by Mrs Hargraves, yet
another fine performance
this time by Coral Browne.
The story also eloquently
explains the behaviour of
both Mrs Hargreaves whose
early experiences have led
her to regard love as 'an
emotion that has always
frightened me' and the Rev
Dogson in terms of their
the shadows from the
corner of the room'.
Director Gavin Miller
treats Potter's story with
the care and respect that it
deserves. Go and dream.
If you are someone who
reads the Guardian
regularly you would have
noticed a story on the front
page of the 26 January
edition about the
corruption of the French
Police force and how one
particular film was
influential in this. This film
has now arrived in Britain
and is called Le Cop. It is
blamed because its story is
one that suggests that
corruption is the norm
within the police force and
that crime pays. It's
probably this last reason
that has caused the British
censor to try and protect
public morals by giving the
film an 18 certificate.
Phillipe Noiret plays a
cop with 20 years in the
Police force who
supplements his income by
various perks, free meals at
a restaurant for ignoring
illegal gambling, free shirts
for ignoring the illegal
immigrants in the sweat
shop, he also does his bit
to keep the crime figures
down by failing to arrest
pickpockets. However one
day he and his partner
bungle a job and his
partner is arrested and
replaced by a keen new
graduate who is strictly
honest and reads the penal
code in his lunch break in
preparation for his exams
in two years.
The rest of the film then
details the attempts of
Phillipe Noiret to corrupt
his new partner in order to
try and restore normality to
this beat. He proves to be
all too successful.
It is a charming little
comedy from Claude Zidi
who is noted for such
things, and in a lean period
for films it is well worth
considering.
Briefly I'd like to mention
that the highly entertaining
Ghostbusters is back on at
the wonderful Odeon
Marble Arch. I think it's still
the largest screen in
Europe and the experience
of sitting in the stalls (go
for the stalls rather than the
circle) is fantastic, and
besides how many cinemas
do you know with
escalators and tropical fish
in the bar that only costs
Â£2 to students.
