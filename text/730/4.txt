Boring
But True
An Academic Affairs
general meeting of
Departmental Reps and
Academic Reps from all
departments was held on
Wednesday. The meeting,
the first of its kind in recent
years, was described by
ICU Academic Affairs
Officer J Martin Taylor as
'very successful'.
The meeting was
addressed by Professor
Blow of the Physics
Department, who is
chairman of the new
committee responsible for
reviewing teaching at the
College, the Undergraduate
Studies Committee (USC).
He spoke about the nature
of university teaching and
its relation to research, and
the events that led to his
committee being formed
and the work it is currently
carrying out. He then
discussed points raised by
students at the meeting.
Professor Blow revealed
that a chance remark by Sir
Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,
then University Grants
Committee Chairman, that
while IC is excellent at
research, its teaching
leaves something to be
desired, led to the
formation of the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee. Earlier in his
address, Professor Blow
quoted the saying that
'those who can, do; and
those who can't teach'. He
then went on to say that
this didn't apply at IC
because no-one became a
lecturer here unless they
had proven their ability to
'do'. He noted that many
students believe there is a
conflict between research
and teaching, and feel that
the latter suffers as a result.
While he admitted that
there is a conflict of time
between the two activities,
he refuted the idea that
teaching is regarded as less
importantâ€”'no research is
any use unless it can be
communicated', he said. He
thought that there is still an
impression amongst
academic staff that
teaching is not important
for promotion, but the
College is 'leaning over
backwards' to change this.
Later the meeting split
into three discussion
groups designed to help
student representatives
develop the skills required
to prepare a case and
present arguments to their
departments. The three
topics used in the exercise
were: retaining an effective
tutorial system, provision
for humanities options as
part of degree courses, and
September resit exams.
Each group prepared its
case, which they then
argued out with a 'Head of
Department' played by Carl
Burgess. Finally, the
Union's new academic
affairs policy was
discussed.
The meeting lasted for
three hours and was
attended by about forty
student represntatives who
came from all departments.
Mr Taylor believes it will
provide an extra impetus to
academic affairs work at
departmental level. He
expressed some
disappointment that more
Academic Reps didn't
attend, but thought that all
those who did turn up had
found the meeting useful.
He added that it is intended
that the event should
become an annual one,
with the next to be held in
the Autumn term.
Smith Speaks
Delia Smith visited More
House last Sunday to give
a talk on prayer as part of
Contact Week. The well-
known television
personality and practising
Catholic stressed the need
to study the Bible
contemplatively and to set
aside quiet time for
personal prayer, although
she considered that the
word 'prayer' is overused
and off-putting.
Delia Smith has written
two books of meditation
and reflection on Scripture:
'A Feast for Lent' and 'A
Feast for Advent'.
Party
RSMU had to move their
Pyjama Party from the
Holland Club to the J C R at
very short notice on
Wednesday. Mines had
invited members of the
American Institute For
Foreign Study, but the
Holland Club is only open
to IC members. They also
had not obtained a licence.
Alan Larsen, the J C R bar
manager, was unable to put
on a bar as he was
previously engaged.
Beer and wine, bought
from the Holland Club, was
sold until 10pm after which
it was provided free.
Sometime mechanical engineering student Giles Edward is
informed that he has failed to break the world land speed
record during Guild's Motor Club's autotest on Sunday.
Claim It
The Student Services
Office is encouraging
students living in halls of
residence to claim housing
benefit, following a
reorganisation of rent bills.
Instead of indicating a
single amount for total rent,
invoices will now show a
seperate figure for rent and
rates. This will mean that
students are entitled to a
larger rebate. Until now,
few students living in
College accomodation have
filed claims because the
benefit payable was so low.
All students are advised to
claim, although residents of
Garden Hall and the
student houses may not be
elligible for benefit as their
rent is too low.
Claim forms are available
from Lesley Gillingham in
the Student Services Office
at 15 Princes Gardens.
Ash
Impressed
370 staff and past and
present students attended
City and Guilds Dinner and
Dance on Friday. Speaking
at the dinner, IC Rector
Professor Eric Ash said that
he was impressed by the
high standards in all
departments. He added,
though, that he was
concerned about the
serious financial problems
faced by IC.
