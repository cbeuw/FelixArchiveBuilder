Fan Belt Fashion Is the
next big thing, or so Steve
Gorky told me the other
night over several bottles of
lighter fluid. He, with a few
other members of the
Islington Tasmanian
Workers Collective, create
clothes made up entirely of
the rubber fan belts found
in 1950s vacuum cleaners
Imported from Illinois, and
sell them at Camden
Market.
"We've taken vacuum
cleaners into the
mainstream," says Steve
(one of the garageland
band—Electrolux Babies).
"It used to be just the
fetishists Into them — real
heavy stuff, you know.
Kitchen Hoover orgies, sink
plungers, the lot. But now
its real fashion — just like
these vinyl stilleto boots
with matching manacles
I've got on."
Not into fan belts? Not to
worry, London street-
markets have much more to
offer. Sticking with Camden
Market, where else can you
find the latest bootleg from
'Dinner Zamfurshreift', the
band from Upper Saxony
who pile into railway
bridges with Black and
Decker hammer drills
(Bosch drills don't convey
quite the same depth of
meaning, apparently)?
Such obscurity may not be
to taste, but at least one of
the many stalls are bound
to have that LP of Aretha
Franklin guesting with the
Nolan Sisters, having
recorded songs with just
about everyone else.
Whereas most markets
wind up selling the trousers
even Marks and Spencer
won't touch, Camden has
the advantage of having
people sell their own
designs, among the endless
racks of good secondhand
clothes. The same goes for
Kensington Market, which
scores over Camden being
both Indoors and just up
the road — just in case you
don't like running Into
gangs of very apprehensive
metal monkeys every five
minutes, at this time of
year. The choice of attire In
both markets Is incredible,
especially if your favourite
colours are black and
dayglo pink.
Finding both markets Is
dead easy. Camden market
is best reached by Camden
Town tube (Northern Line).
Simply turn right at the top
of the escalators and then
right again onto Camden
High Street. The market is
on the right, just past the
Electric Ballroom. It is open
every Friday, Saturday and
Sunday.
Further up the road is
. . . - f C a p i t a l
IDEAS
Camden Lock market,
which opens on just
Sundays, but is very
worthwhile since it extends
the range on show here.
This market is essentially
shrink-wrapped around
Dlngwalls, which is ,
probably the best use for
that particular club.
Kensington market is in
Kensington High Street,
between the college and
Barkers. This one opens on
Wednesdays and
Saturdays.
In the words of many,
many people, but not
Eugene Zhog, the famed
Albanian mountain cycling
champion, this week I
witnessed the end of one
era and the beginning of
another. The era that had
ended was the live career
of the group Here & Now,
at the pokey little hole
which had the
pretentiousness to call
Itself Dingwalls Dancehall.
Here & Now are perhaps
not the best known of
groups but their personal
philosophy and their rather
special following make
them worthy of mention.
Not having taken a very
commercial attitude they
will probably be unknown
to most people at college,
and those that have heard
of them will probably
associate them with the
out-and-out hippy group
Gong. This is somewhat
misleading although Here &
Now had their roots in that
era. They were the epitomy
of the alternative group,
playing many free gigs and
festivals including regular
appearances at Stonehenge
along with the likes of
Hawkwind and the Enid.
But their sound which was
rhythmic In the same way
as the Police drew them
one of the most varied
audiences I have seen for
any group. The previous
Friday I saw them play a
packed gig at Bournemouth
Town Hall which was a
.++ .+
large and excellent venue.
So It came as something of
a surprise that they should
choose Dingwalls for their
farewell gig and to film with
high quality equipment at
such a poor venue. The
main point of all this Is to
say what a rotten venue
Dingwalls is. It seems to be
cursed with Incurably
unbalanced sound and of
such a size that most pub
venues seem like
cathedrals. Not only that
but the layout seems
designed to make the worst
possible use of the
available space, It certainly
left me with about three
inches to stand in. On this
.occasslon the atmosphere
I (about 30% marijuana
"smoke by my estimate)
made up for the venue. The
only reasons I can see for
Dingwalls survival is that It
is located In trendy
Camden Lock and exists in
a city where there Is a
remarkable lack of decent
medium sized venues.
One possible sign of
hope for up and coming
groups Is the Bull and Gate
at Kentish Town, 100 yards
from the tube. Here on
Tuesday I saw the London
debut of Half Man, Half
Biscuit who have been
raved about in previous
articles.
The Bull has a largish
hall built onto It where
every Tuesday and
Wednesday they are aiming
to run a thing called the
Timebox. They aim to
present each night a known
group who are still on their
way up along with a couple
of relative unknowns. They
promote gigs In
conjunction with Rough
Trade Records and are also
advertising for people to
send them demo tapes
which seems a
commendable approach.
But back to Half
Man, Half Biscuit who I'm
glad to say seem to have
become a minor cult after
our discovery of their
album 'Back in the DHSS'
(what do you mean 'John
Peel'?). In fact neither the
over capacity crowd nor
the group seemed to know
exactly what to expect of
the set which consisted
essentially of the Peel
session material plus the
album. Still they could do
nothing wrong and could
have played encores all
night. It will be interesting
to see if they can follow up
their Camberwick Green
goes ranting punk debut
with something equally as
strong.
* Another gig at the
Timebox worth going to If
you are Into psychedelic
punk or music of a similar
description, Is Leather Nun,
plus Zodiac Mlndwarp on
the 25th February.
On to other venues, I
have been asked to
mention the ever worthy
Cabaret Voltaire who are
playing the Town and
Country Club on the 11th
and 12th February. This
time the band has been
described as being able to
'turn the dancefloor Into a
minefield' actually have a
support, Rory McLeod,
Instead of the usual
melange of videos.
The Cramps have
announced their long
awaited London dates as
the 14th and 15th March.
These are at the
Hammersmith Odeon —
why on earth they aren't
playing the Palais I don't
know, as It would seem to
suit their style much more.
They have an album out
sometime following the
conclusion of their hassles
with the IRS label and the
tour is titled 'A Night With
Elvis'. Expect tongues to be
wedged firmly in cheeks for
a dose of the ultimate In
psycho-garage shock
horror punk and roll.
Well I'm breaking off now
to see whether Peel's
dicovered a heavy metal
version of Hammy Hamster
who's going to blow Roland
Rat into oblivion (he'll
probably have some late
sixties power trio refugee
on drums). So I'll finish by
saying that if you ever think
there's no time for a break
just remember the words of
Raoul Vaneigem who has
never to my knowledge
been mountain cycling in
Albania—"This could be
our last chance to unmake
history."
FELIX Friday 7 February
