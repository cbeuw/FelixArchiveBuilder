Teaching Standards
My remarks about teaching
standards in FELIX last
week seem to have irritated
some people. I was not
trying to defend
Government cuts in
funding for higher
education. The cuts have
affected undergraduate
labs. They have affected
research. They have
resulted in courses being
cut. I was attacking certain
academics inability to
teach. Most IC students will
have been to lectures that
have been
incomprehensible because
the lecturer has been
inarticulate, produced
unreadable slides for the
overhead projector or
rushed through new
material at an amazing rate.
This isn't because of
Government cuts. It's
because they haven't put
enough effort into course
preparation.

Congratulations on an

Religions
Different
Dear Sir,
Can I thank Andrew Dunn
for his letter published in
last week's FELIX. He made
some good points,
although I don't agree with
all of them. However, I
think I should point out one
mistake. Andrew said that,
'The Christian would
say...that all religions
believe in the same God'.
Although this is thought to
be an enlightened and
fashionable thing to
believe, there are several
reasons why I believe it's
untrue. First of all it's
illogical. How can all
religions lead to the same
God when they are so
different? The G o d of
Hinduism is plural and
impersonal but the God of
Islam is singular and
personal. The God of
was very funny.

Remember to get all those
small ads in for next week's
Valentine's issue. They're
free and need to be in the
FELIX Office by 1.30pm on
Monday.

Christianity is the Creator
of the world, but the divine
of Buddhism is not
personal and not creative.
The goal of all existence in
Buddhism is nirvana-
existance, but in
Christianity to know God
and enjoy him forever.
Maybe the greatest
difference is between the
Bible which asserts that no
one can save himself and
make himself pleasing to
God, however hard he tries;
and almost all other faiths
which assert that by
keeping to their teaching a
man will be saved, or
reborn, or made whole or
reach fulfillment.
Secondly, it is impossible
for two reason. First, if
there is a god then he is
the source of man and
everything around him and
lord over all human life.
The prophet Isaiah spoke
of G o d 'whom did he
consult for his
enlightenment and who
taught him the path of
knowledge and showed him
the way of understanding?
Behold, the nations are like
a drop from a bucket, and
are accounted as dust on
the scales.' If this is the
God we're talking about
then how can we expect to
find him? Can the cup
understand the potter who
made it? Whether we like it
or not, man cannot find
God however hard and
long he searches. Religion
then is bound to fail, if by it
we mean man's search for
God. What we need is not a
mosaic made up from the
various chinks of light
discovered in different
religions, but for the sun to
rise. And that is exactly
what Christianity offers.
The Bible tells us not of
man's search for God, but
God's search for man.
The second reason it's
impossible is because of
the problem of our own
nature. Man sins, failing not
only to meet God's
standards but often his
own. Paul, the writer of
much of the New
Testament, comes to the
conclusion at the end of his
indictment of Roman
society that 'There is none
righteous, no, not one.
There is none that
understands and seeks
after God'. G o d shows us
up for the self-centred
beings we are and so many
of us avoid Him, dreading
the thought that he might
come close to us. Our
sinful nature and his
perfect infinite nature form
a barrier between Him and
us, which we can't
overcome...but there's no
reason for God not to
overcome it, and that is just
what the Bible claims Jesus
did. He came to earth to
overcome the barrier and
show us what God is like.
My reason for writing at
such length is not to start
any interfaith arguments-
that is rarely helpful. Rather
I want to point out that the
idea of all religions being
the same thing in the long
run just doesn't square up
with the facts. Therefore we
shouldn't use it as an
excuse for not thinking
about God.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Pettman
Well Taught
Dear Sir
I would be interested in any
justification you would be
prepared to give of your
comments last week about
the apparent low teaching
standards at IC. In my
experience of IC to date
teaching standards have
usually surpassed my
expectations and could
certainly not be described
as 'low'. I cannot help
feeling that some of the
comments in last week's
editorial were, to say the
least, unfair to our lecturers
and probably no more than
a result of a natural (and
universal) inclination to
criticise teachers.
Standards at IC are good
and always getting better.
If people don't find
lecturers interesting then
it's probably because they
are not interested and
should have taken a
different subject. However
any subject will gt times get
tedious, study is work not a
game and this can't be
blamed on the lecturers.
To say that funding levels
don't effect teaching
standards is not only
ultimately wrong but also a
dangerous attitude
especially with a
government prepared to cut
where and whenever it can
get away with it. With cuts
in their wages and criticism
from (some) students. I
sincerely hope that morale
amongst lecturers will
never slip to that amongst
school teachers.
Remember the U G M
voted overwhelmingly to
support the A U T in its
cause.
Yours sincerely

Felicity Rant
Dear Sir,
I presume that FELIX is a
publication of an English
College. Therefore why do
we have ranting American
females writing the Below
the Belt column, inserting
useless American humour
into the column? How can
she have the gall to call
people kids when she's
younger than most people
at College? And who is she
to talk about living in sin?
(See issue of January
10thâ€”incidentally
incorrectly dated January
11th). I am surprised that
Student Services let her
shack up with 'Superwimp'
J Martin Taylor in single
accommodation! I say get
rid of Felicity the Catty! It
is far too early for her to be
trying for FELIX Sabbatical
credibility! To sign off, I
will just say that FELIX is
getting nearly as boring as
Guildsheet, and is just
becoming a magazine for
FELIX hacks. Even when
they try nicking a decent
idea, such as Below the
Belt, lifted from the
