Yet another glorious outing
for the mixed Hockey team,
with this weeks theme
'Improvisation'.
The fun started on
Saturday night with the
captain, Spence, using all
his charm and wit to cajole
some ladies into joining the
fun, and unusually
(crap-Ed) meeting with
only limited success but
man of the moment,
Brendon Farmer, was
improvising all night long
in Southside and lo and
behold we had a fifth
woman.
Sunday morning saw us
piling into what appeared
to be a respectable minibus
(it had a radio!!) to find our
way to Egham with Hugh
'I'm really a good driver'
Southey improvising in the
driving seat and the great
Rolf Slatter trying to lead
us there in his high
performance skoda.
However the team was
soon spilt with two lechers
eyeing up the talent in the
R H B N C S U (TUB)
overlunch whilst everyone
else contemplated Hugh's
driving in the pub.
At this juncture we
noticed the filler cap on the
van was missing and the
petrol was steadily spitting
out. But the great
improviser Justin Brooking,
was at hand to remedy the
situation by jamming a
plastic milk bottle in the
hole.
Eventually the game got
under way with our three
novice ladies, Lorna
Stoodley, Jacky Knowles
and Kate Hartley
improvising for all they
were worth and putting up
quite a respectable show.
The captain again
became a martyrs to the
cause by giving up the
chance to be on the
winning side by playing for
the opposition. The result
does not do justice to
RHBNC's commitment,
skill, professionalism and
sheer determination
although we must
acknowledge Justin's
herioc solo effort to score
the only goal.
Because of the treachery
of the captain the rest of
the team conspired to leave
him in Egham but he got
wise to this and managed
to do a James Bond sytle
leap on to the roof rack
although it was several
miles before he was let
back into the bus, and only
on the condition that, as
the windscreen wipers were
not working, he got out
every half mile to work
them by hand. This worked
well until High Street Ken
when the gallant driver
tried to leave him behind
and almost pushed him
under a bus (thanks Hugh).
After changing his
trousers the capt then
improvised his way to a
team pizza and general
festivities in the revamped
Norfolk.
Thank you all for
improvising the team, I
don't think you really
appreciate how much I do
for you but I love you all
really.
Fencing
After the incredibly narrow
defeats by Leeds in the
UAU (14 lights to 13, and
yet we scored more hits
than they did), it was good
to see the team's morale
returned. Even without our
national squad member, IC
were fully in control with
the sabre, which at times
tended to be fought more
like two handed
broadsword. U C have a
strong foil team and we
couldn't hope to win easily,
if at all. Even so, 7-2 was a
poor result. The epee too
was disappointing. The IC
team fought well but
frequently without the
accuracy this weapon
demands.
The return match in a
few weeks time should be a
different story. ICFC will
put forward a team with
even more might and
power then that which won
the U A U South Eastern
region two months ago.
By way of a post script,
if anyone is interested in
seeing some real fencing, I
am going to watch some of
the Heron Paul Cup on
Saturday 8th February. This
is one of the premiere
mews foil events held in
this country. It's free to go
in and I'll wait in the Union
Gym until 10-30am on Sat
to show people the way
and comment on the
action.

Imperial College Bowling
Club passed away last
Saturday at the Tolworth
Bowl. It was a slow, painful
death, brought about by
terminal apathy, drawn out
by the late arrival of
Southampton. Soon after
this the club's health
rapidly deteriorated.
The impending demise of
the club was an emotional
moment for team members,

9 of which were not at its
bedside. There was a brief
hope of a recovery during
the first game when mouth
to mouth resucitation by
the B team paramedics B
Kwok, R Ingram and A
Tress but to no avail. The
club quickly slipped from
the land of the living as the
next five games were lost.
The burial of the club
was tastefully handled by
Southampton and the
coffin bearers were the A
team's T Apostoli, E Ling
and G Wong. The service
was too much for B Kwok
who left before its
completion.
The club leaves a widow,
M Morris, and a large
overdraft. A collection was
taken at the end and a
memorial is to be held
outside Chem Eng Foyer at
2.20pm on Wednesay.
Karate
Two weeks before the end
of last term saw IC venture
into the National Student
Championship at Keele
University.
This year we entered two
Kumite (fighting) and Kata
(Display) teams. The
competition was tough in
that a high majority of
senior grades were present
as well as numerous
spectators from 14
universities, including Andy
Shirai (6 Dan) the top
British Instructor.
The Kumite teams did
not too well, teaching the
2nd round with the 'A'
team. Individually, however
a more spirited attempt was
made, with Russel Norton
reaching as far as the
preliminary round to the
quarter finals. (Injuries
were not amiss with Jez
suffering a serious black-
eye from an over-zealous
opponent in a semi-contact
tournament.) The eventual
winner was an experienced
England U'21 from
Liverpool Poly.
The achievement of the
day was the Kata event, in
which pre-training proved
its reward when IC walked
away with silver and
Bronze medals losing only
marginally to 'Cambridge
Univ.' IC K C are currently
training hard for the
Southern Counties held in
March.

This weeks Wednesday results table is a little sparse because
nobody bothered to tell FELIX how they did. All you need do is
drop into the FELIX Office (Beit Arch) on Wednesday evening on
your way to the Union Bar and tell us the score.
