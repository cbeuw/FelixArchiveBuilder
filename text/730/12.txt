G U Y S 1sts 2—IC 2nds 3
Luke Skywalker could not
have masterminded a more
thrilling and exciting
comeback from the dead as
the battle-weary troops
braved a howling wind and
sheeting rain to plunder the
points from the home of
the current league leaders.
With the wind at their
backs, the injury-ravaged
IC outfit (Guilds D&D?)
struggled to contain the
subtle blend of pace, skill
and aggression exhibited
by the home forward line.
On the few occasions that
they breached the solid
defensive unit of
Cummings, Wilson, Bradley
and Day, IC's port
custodian Tony 'The Flying
Whale' Whitehead
responded with some
surprisingly agile
goalkeeping.
As midfield terriers
Barrow and Adams began
to battle and bite, IC's
newly formed strike force
of Houseby and Vanden
Begin found an increasing
number of half chances
coming their way.
On the stroke of half time
Houseby, cramped for
space, somehow found an
inch to curl a goal worthy
of Dalglish ensuring a
buoyant mood as the teams
lined up for the second
period.
The bubble soon burst as
the wind-assisted Guys hit
back with two superb
strikes leaving IC once
again with the odds
stacked against them.
To the rescue galloped
Alex 'Steve Heighway'
Lunghi who with blinding
pace created and clinically
finished a goal to savour.
As the game ebbed and
flowed, Engberg was the
rock on which the home
attacks floundered, and a
magnificient victory was
secured when in the dying
seconds, Vanden Begin
unleashed an unstoppable
Mark Hughes type volley
from the twenty five yards
to commence VE Day.
Celebrations all over again.
IC 1sts 4 St Thomas 1sts 1
ICs fourth successive win
was achieved with a
workman like performance.
The game started with IC
maintaining their previous
good form scoring twice in
the first 10 minutes.
The first came when Alex
Lunghi's corner was
headed powerfully home
from 10 yards by central
defender Chris Engbery.
The second came when
Paul Bravery's shot was
turned over the line by Guy
Poppy who promptly went
off with an injured ankle.
IC went off the ball as St
Thomas' came back into
the game but increased
their lead when Shaun
Thomas's cross cum shot
was volleyed home by Russ
Cummings' right knee cap
from just outside the
penalty box.
The game was made safe
when Shaun Thomas beat
the St Thomas keeper at
the near post with a 25 year
drive.
St Thomas' scored a
consolation goal with their
first real effort of the game,
a superb 25 yard chip.
Again praise must go to
ICs defence with another
solid performance in
limiting St Thomas' to one
shot on goal. Tom Dutton's
wing wizardry was again in
evidence in his last game
for IC; we all wish him
success in Geneva.

U C L 1st XV 12 IC 1sts XV 14
U C L 2nd XV 8 IC 2nd XV 9
Both the first and second
XV were victorious over
University College last
Wednesday. The first XV
won 14points-12 while the
seconds sneaked home 9-8.
It was a strange build up
to the afternoon's exercise
as the IC players were
treated to a guided tour of
the Hertfordshire
countryside. We all thought
it was a new kind of
therapy until it was
revealed that our mentor
and navigator was an ex-
U C L player.
In the 1st team game, it
ws U C L who opened the
scoring in the first half. At
6-0 down at half time after
soaking up most of the
pressure IC played with
great determination and
were rewarded with two
Follard penalties. Excellent
tackling from Goetz and
Hartley kept U C L pinned in
their own half and fine
loose play from Hargrove
and Dancer tore into the
opposition's defence and
created gaps. With an
increasing supply of ball
and backs were able to
release Secombe on some
dangerous runs.
Anderson's charge down
try was just deserts.
Leading 10-6 IC released
and let U C L in for a try in
the corner, duly converted.
The last 10 minutes were
hectic and following a neat
break by Anderson and a
clever long pass from Agar,
Secombe sprinted for the
corner to touchdown two
minutes from time. At 14-12
U C L were awarded a last
kick for the game penalty
from wide out, justice was
done as the ball harmlessly
passed the upright.
In the 2nd XV's game all
the scoring came in the
second half. A good
penalty from new recruit,
Watkins and a try for Andy
Coope converted by
Watkins saw IC lead 9-0.
Slack defence allowed U C L
to grab two late tries but as
they were unconverted IC
hung on to win 9-8.
Afterwards, Captain Rich
Ladd said it was just the
fillip the club needed.
IC 1sts XV 15 South Bank
Poly 1st XV 6
An IC team without many
of the 1st XV regulars
entertained South Bank
Polytechnic on the
Saturday. With several
players offering their
services coming straight
from the Guilds D&D the
atmosphere was a mixture
of vacancy and German
Riesling. However once on
the field IC played with
aggression and skill,
playing with the elements
IC needed to amass points
and it was a pushover try
by J D which set them on
their way-Holland
converted. Continually IC
threatened to run riot. Andy
Watson at scrum-half
marshalled his troops and
set them going forward at
pace from incisive breaks
and astute kicking. A poor
clearance from the South
Bank full-back allowed
Agar to gather and jink
through. Follard again
converted and slotted over
a penalty to make it 15-0 at
half-time.
Moving the ball through
the hands proved the best
policy in the second half
and only last-ditch tackles
and poor handling thwarted
IC's efforts. Somewhat
inevitably South Bank
touched down but it was
too late to affect the
outcome. IC survived the
late pressure to triumph 15
points to 6 points. The IC
forwards deserve special
mention for their effort;
none more than the wing
forward Lee and Chappel
who were everywhere both
in attack and defence.

IC 1sts 13—New College 6
Imperial College Rugby
Club reached the final of
the Gulterbridge Cup last
Wednesday by defeating
New College 13 pts to 6 in
a clean but hard fought
game at Harlington.
The team played with a
spirit and commitment not
seen since early last term.
The forwards were
outstanding n the first half-
against the elements they
scrummaged well and were
marauding in the loose,
preventing the New College
half backs from
establishing the attacking
platform they required to
put enough points on the
board to defend with any
confidence.
Although Imperial
conceded two early
penalties in the first quarter
of the game the final ten
minutes of the first half
were played threatening the
opponents goal line.
Concerted pressure
resulted in a push-over try
by Steve Parker after earlier
Captain Rob Hargrove had
been denied in a similar
effort. The try was
unconverted but Imperial
turned round at half time
with the knowledge that the
game was there for the
taking.
Good tactical kicking
from fly half Mike Anderson
kept New College under
pressure and careless late
tackles from a tiring New
College defence gave
Folland the opportunity to
kick. 3 straight forward
penalties. At 13-6 with ten
minutes to go New College
threw the ball around in
desperate attempts to
counter attack and pull the
game back, however
Imperial's defence held
form until the whistle went
for no side.
The final of the
Gutteridge Cup will be
played on Sunday March
2nd at Motspur Park.
Support for the club is
always welcome and
special 'free' coaches will
be provided for people
wishing to come along and
exercise their larynx.
Even if you do not
understand all the rules.of
the game it is worth
coming along just to hear
the great combination of
accents produced by the
team's back row!
