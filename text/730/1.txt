Kings To
Affiliate
Kings vote, by a majority of 402,
to join the NUS following the
merger with QEC and Chelsea
Students of Kings College
(KQC) have voted to affiliate
to the National Union of
Students. Of the 2140 votes
cast in the referendum on
Monday and Tuesday,
approximately 60% were in
favour of affiliation.
The C o l l e g e - w i d e ballot
was bought about by the
merger of K i n g s with
C h e l s e a a n d Q u e e n
Elizabeth C o l l e g e s . Prior to
the merger both C h e l s e a and
Q E C had been affiliated to
the N U S but K i n g s , by far
the largest of the C o l l e g e s ,
had not been affiliated. T h e
merger has been phased in
gradually, a n d students have
been attending lectures on
different sites for two years.
T h e students' unions have
remained separate until this
a c a d e m i c session, however.
T h e voting figures
represent a turnout of
around 35% of the 6100
students at K i n g s ( K Q C ) .
1978 of the voting papers
were valid of w h i c h 1190
were in favour of affiliation
and 788 were against.
D u a n e P a s s m a n , acting
General Secretary of K Q C U
and E d u c a t i o n and Welfare
Officer for the K e n s i n g t o n
site (formerly Q E C ) , s p o k e to
F E L I X about the referendum
on W e d n e s d a y . He said he
was 'absolutely exstatic' with
the result, a n d added that he
c o n s i d e r e d it highly likely
that the vote had been in
favour at e a c h c a m p u s ,
though there were no figures
to confirm this. At the time
of going to press, F E L I X had
been unable to contact either
Ian M a r k h a m or M i c h a e l
C o n n o l l y , the E d u c a t i o n and
Welfare Officers for the
Strand (Kings) and C h e l s e a
sites of the C o l l e g e .
A Wacky Raider
Students from University
College inserted fake 'lucky
winner' vouchers into several
copies of FELIX after the
paper had been distributed
last Friday. The vouchers
proclaimed that the holder of
the copy had won five
pounds in the 'FELIX Grand
Draw' and should collect
their prize from the FELIX
Office. Around forty students
brought vouchers into the
office only to be
disappointed to learn that
the competition was a hoax.
T h e raid was organised by
students w h o work on Pi, the
N e w s p a p e r of U C L , in
retaliation to c o m m e n t s
made about Pi in the F E L I X
' B e l o w T h e Belt' c o l u m n on
J a n u a r y 17. T h e irrate U C L
students also put up posters
arround the U n i o n B u i l d i n g
d e n o u n c i n g F E L I X as
'possibly the world's most
pretentious magazine' a n d
claiming triumphantly that 'Pi
strikes again!'
M e m b e r s of the F E L I X staff
attempted a counter-raid on
M o n d a y , the day o n w h i c h Pi
is regularly published. T h e y
arrived at the U C L U n i o n
Building before morning
lectures began.
Unfortunately there were no
c o p i e s of Pi to be found. It
was discovered that
production problems had
delayed production of the
newspaper. T h e raid was
repeated on T u e s d a y
morning, only to meet with a
similar lack of s u c c e s s .
F E L I X received several
telephone calls from Pi staff
members who claimed to
represent L o n d o n Student
and were anxious to discover
if F E L I X was planning any
reprisals against U C L . F E L I X
contacted the Pi Office on
T u e s d a y afternoon and were
told that publication of Pi
w o u l d probably be delayed
until next M o n d a y . T h e r e are
no plans to get up at 7am for
a third time.
Hi-De-Hi
Southside
Managing Surveyor (Residences)
Peter Hallworth slams Southside
sleep in.
Students woken by workmen
at 8.15am would 'be glad of
the "Alarm Call" ' according
to Managing Surveyor
(Residences) Peter
Hallworth. In a letter to
Tizard Hall Chairman Steve
Norton, Mr Hallworth
explained that in his view, as
lectures start at 9.30am,
students would want to be
woken up by 8.15am.
M r Hallworth was replying
to Mr Norton's criticism that
the work being carried out in
Southside had c a u s e d
considerable disturbance
(See F E L I X 31 J a n u a r y ) . Mr
Hallworth said that 'it is
inevitable that s o m e
inconvenience is c a u s e d
whenever building works are
undertaken, especially when
the premises remain
o c c u p i e d during the period
when the works are carried
out. I am satisfied that
disturbances in S o u t h s i d e
Building during the present
contract have been kept to a
minimum'.
Mr Norton told F E L I X that
he had been to see M r
Hallworth to d i s c u s s the
letter. Mr Norton felt that
s o m e of Mr Hallworth's views
were mistaken, and he tried
to correct these. M r
Hallworth offered to organise
a meeting between himself,
the contractors, the
housekeeper and M r Norton.
