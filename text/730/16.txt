Roll Up,
Roll Up
Congratulations are due
this week to ICU Welfare
Officer Pete Wilson on the
installation of a
contraceptive machine in
Southside Gents. 'It's really
been my baby all along',
said a bouyant Mr Wilson,
'and I'm relieved it's finally
been delivered'. The
machine arrived earlier this
week, quashing fears of yet
another Union cock-
up—the idea was first
conceived several months
ago and the machine has
been eagerly expected ever
since.
Two 'Durex Fetherlite'
contraceptives can be
purchased for only fifty
pence, so, amid fears of an
inflating market, get them
before they run out!
Durham Durham
The Bishop of Durham, the
Rt Rev David Jenkins,
attracted a large audience
when he spoke on 'living as
a faithful Christian' at IC on
Wednesday. The Rev
Jenkins said that many
people expected religion to
provide a simple answer to
their problems.
He also felt that the
ability of humans to
comprehend the Universe
was evidence of God's
existence. God, he said,
was part being and part
concept.
When the meeting was
opened to questions Guilds
President Roger Preece
asked the Rev Jenkins
about his opinions on the
resurrection. He replied
that the resurrection was a
spiritual resurrection. 'I'm
not sure whether the
stories about the empty
tomb were started 10 or 15
years later' he said. He felt
that an empty tomb was
not proof of a physical
resurrection and pointed
out that the resurrection
stories in the Gospels did
not agree.
The Bishop believed that
the accounts of the Virgin
birth were very similar to
stories in myths and
legends. He explained that
the word 'virgin' was
introduced in the second
and third century to supply
a neoplatonic meaning.
Union Prospect
For Prospectus
An Alternative Prospectus
may be produced by the
Union this year, if the
College agrees to provide
extra funds for the
publication.
It was decided last week
that the Union could not
afford to produce an A P
this year. The publication
has been produced
annually for over ten years,
but the financial pressures
when last year's Union
estimates were being
finalized led to the AP
being cut. Early this
session the Academic
Affairs Committee
expressed its concern
about the lack of a new AP.
On Tuesday ICU
Academic Affairs Officer J
Martin Taylor presented a
paper to the College's
Admissions Policy
Committee arguing that the
AP, as the Union's
contribution to recruitment,
was a valuable asset to the
College which should be at
least partially funded
directly by the College. The
paper went on to say that,
even if there are criticisms
of some courses in it, the
AP helps applicants to
make a positive decision in
favour of IC since they
have more unbiased
information on which to
base their choice.
The Admissions Policy
Committee agreed to
support Mr Taylor's request
for funds, and the matter
will now be raised with the
Rector, Professor Ash.
Wacky
Estimate
RSMU have submitted an
estimate of £17100 for next
year's budget, an increase
of over 100%.
ICU Deputy President
Dave Kingston told FELIX
that the Mines estimate had
not included a figure for
income. Mines President
Dave Pearce had not seen
the estimate before it was
sent to Mr Kingston by
Mines HJT Brian Sullivan.
Mr Pearce later agreed with
Mr Kingston that the claim
was too high. Earlier, Mr
Kingston had commented
that 'some of the estimates
looked like they've been
cobbled together by a
bunch of blokes who've sat
down in a bar and said
"let's see what we can
screw the Union for" '.
Panic
RCS may be without a
speaker for today's Annual
Dinner after comedian
Willie Rushton withdrew
earlier this week. RCS Hon
Sec Tom Melliar-Smith
telephoned Mr Rushton's
secretary on Wednesday
and was informed that he
had been admitted to
Nottingham Hospital with
appendicitis. At the time of
going to press, Mr Melliar-
Smith was approaching
other possible speakers,
including ex-editor of
Punch Bill Davies.
Apology
Union President Carl
Burgess has received an
apology from the
management of Bananas
night club following a letter
from Mr Burgess protesting
about the treatment of
Alistair Seymour (see
FELIX letters January 24).
Mr Burgess was told that
the bouncers and manager
who insulted Mr Seymour
were no longer working at
the club. Mr Burgess has
been promised an apology
in writing.
Recovering
Third year chemist Andrew
Healey is now out of
intensive care and talking
conversationally. Mr Healey
was admitted to Charing
Cross Hospital last term
with thallium poisoning. He
is still, however, suffering
from paralysis in his legs
and is receiving
physiotherapy for this
condition.
Thallium, a transition
metal, attacks the nervous
system resulting in
muscular paralysis and hair
loss. The investigation as to
how Mr Healey came to
ingest the metal is
continuing.
Disgusting
Welfare Officer, Lesley
Gillingham told FELIX on
Wednesday that she would
never drink again in the
Union Bar following some
disgusting behaviour by
RSM rugby. She said that
they were behaving as
though it was a bar night
even though it wasn't.
