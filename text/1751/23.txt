progress, machines, and a striving for power which
fuelled the Italian futurists. In the case of Afrofu-
turism, it was a striving for equality, for due recog-
nition, and for
the ability to
imagine a black
future. This as-
pect - the power
of imagination,
is one that is
emphasized by
most experts on
the topic. Ini-
tially, it came
from a concrete
lack of black
superheroes in
sci-fi. No one
could deny the
fact that the vi-
sions of gleam-
ing skyscrapers
and flying cars,
fantasies inher-
ited from early
20th century fu-
turists and only
emboldened by
the rise of Hol-
lywood, were
being constructed by white people, for white people.
Dery’s essay Black To the Future, first published in
the early 90s, lists many concrete pieces of evidence
of this absence, and points out the consequences of
this dearth. In the episode 623 of the podcast and
radio program This American
Life, hosts Neil Drumming and
Ira Glass describe the conundrum
quite well.
IG:“And for so long, in so many
imaginings of the future, in so
much science fiction, there were
no black people at all—which […]
makes no sense.”
ND: “[Afrofuturism] imagines
that […] black people have forms
of survival through, you know, the
slave trade, through persecution,
that that’s almost a technology
in itself, the ways in which we’ve
come through those things.”
Before transitioning to the mu-
sic of it all, I feel it necessary to set
the scene, to put a firm pin in the
present which ties it all together.
That scene is Detroit, Michigan,
the birthplace of so many genres of
music it is getting hard to count. It
is also currently a prime example of a city being left
behind in post-industrial America. At times, it can
seem post-apocalyptic. This was the soil on which
many of the different iterations of musical Afrofu-
turism have thrived over the years. For a perfect en-
capsulation of all these eras, past and present, have
a look at

The eery
emptiness
of the ear-
ly-Covid
era it was
shot in
will sure-
ly help in
achieving
the right
mood for

A cou-
ple of
years ago,
a friend
c a m e
upon the
strangely titled artist The Other People Place, whose
only LP, Lifestyles of the Laptop Café, had a unique-
ly minimalist groove, all the while maintaining a
sharp percussive edge. It could have come from no
other place than D-town itself. It turned out that this
album was the product of James
Stinson, who, up to his untimely
death in 2002 following heart com-
plications, had formed one half of
the late-90s electro duo Drexciya.
Their music was not only incredi-
bly fascinating because of how the
futuristic bleeps and bangs sound-
ed both palatable and unique (the
way the 808’s hungry snare bites
through the melancholic Drexci-
yan pads is unmistakable), but also
because of the song titles, which
suggested a lore bigger than the
songs themselves.
Andreaen Sand Dunes, Bubble
Metropolis and Under Sea Distur-
bances are all big Drexciyan hitters
and all have peculiar names relat-
ed to oceans. Drexciya operated
in strictest secrecy, their identities
having been concealed until Stin-
son’s death, and released their mu-
sic on Detroit’s Underground Resistance label. In
keeping with the political edge of the label – implied
by its name and solidified by the militant public per-
sonas of the founders– their songs are fast-paced, in
your face, and have a penchant for the dramatic (be-
sides the aforementioned pads, imagine razor-sharp
and/or wobbly basslines aplenty). But where do the
nautical leanings come from?
Drexciya imagined an alternative reality, where
the babies of pregnant women that had been thrown
overboard from slave ships survived and learned to
thrive underwater. This black Atlantis lived unaware
that there were humans living on land, and devel-
oped to be incredibly technologically advanced,
until contact with humans living above sea became
inevitable – and conflict broke out. Drumming and
Glass actually commissioned hip-hop group Clp-
png to create a song based on this mythology, called
The Deep, for their podcast. If you are interested in
Drexciyan mythology, I urge you to listen to it (as
well as the whole episode of the podcast, which is
thoroughly brilliant), although the imagery is quite
striking. Another creative tribute to Drexciya comes
in the form of a comic book (perhaps a nod to Black
Panther) released earlier this year by Tresor Re-
cords, all in keeping with their mythology.
While Drexciyan sci-fi leanings tended to be
submerged in the deepest depths of the sea, Under-
ground Resistance founder Jeff Mills had his sights
set for the intergalactic (zap me to a crisp, Jeff), but
I can use this opportunity to segue into the final two
acts, both coming much earlier than Detroit techno
or Chicago house (where Larry Heard was making
his own contribution to Afrofuturism with space-
age albums
such as Alien,
and cosmic
ambient explo-
rations in the
vein of Dol-
phin Dream).
On Mills’ re-
cent selection
of his discogra-
phy, released a
year ago on his
own imprint,
Axis Records,
titled Sight,
Sound and
Space, there is
an entire third
dedicated to
- you guessed
it – SPACE.
Some of the
more ambient
tunes on this
third of the
record can be
traced, with
their cosmic
melodies, to
a pioneer of
DREXCIYA
