Electric vehicles (EVs) are unarguably
the future of transportation; well, at
least for the next thirty years. Tesla has
led the EV market, and its incredible
success has drawn the attention of many
companies looking to dip their feet into
the pond of profit. Even non-automo-
tive companies like Sony, Google, Ap-
ple, and even Epic Games have (in some
way) experimented with consumer EVs.
Amazon has recently partnered with
Rivian, a promising
startup in the EV
realm, to produce
more than 100,00
delivery trucks by
2030. With govern-
ment incentives in place for those
looking to purchase an EV, it’s no
wonder why there’s been a recent
boom in their popularity. With this
popularity, however, comes demand,
which calls for rapid advancement in
technology - in this case, battery tech-
nology.
Earlier last month, Tesla held a share-
holder event where they showcased a
new advancement in battery design
that reduced production costs by more
than 55%, thus making their cars more
affordable. Another impressive feat is
the development of Aluminium-Air
(Al-air) batteries, which promise more
than 2400Km in range; however, this
technology is still being developed
and researched by its inventor Trevor
Jackson, a former
UK Royal Navy
officer,
and
his investors.
Trevor argues
that current lith-
ium-based battery technology isn’t
sustainable since the production of
emissions has shifted from vehicles to
power stations. It’s also worth noting
that by 2030, most of the discharged Li-
ion batteries would end up as waste, out
of which only around 5% are recycled.
Aluminium, on the other hand, is the
most abundant metal on our planet and
can be heavily recycled.
Many studies have considered the
limitations of current battery technol-
ogy and experimented with alternate
materials (such as the Al-air battery
mentioned above). Results from
these studies have showcased
battery designs that increase
efficiency with faster charge
cycles, safety with stable
components, and sustain-
ability with durable and
highly recyclable ele-
ments. It takes time for
cutting-edge research
work to translate down
into the consumer
space. As mentioned
by Elon Musk, setting up
a manufacturing facility is
more challenging than design-
ing the actual car; this analogy applies
to battery technology as well. However,
the future indeed looks promising, both
for us and for our environment.

Test & trace data
being sold by
private firms:
prepare yourself
for spam calls &
messages
The UK Government states that
contact tracing information is used
only for the NHS test and trace scheme
and maintained for 21 days. Data-col-
lection firms, on the other hand, have
found their way into storing and selling
user data for at least the next 25 years.
Public venues are required to collect
attendees’ contact tracing information
to detect regional spikes of COVID
transmission. The collection of data is
done through means of QR codes and
handled by companies on behalf of
venues. These data collection companies
have reportedly sold user information
to advertisers and other third-party
data banks. Many have urged the Gov-
ernment to step in and protect users’
privacy, but in any case, be prepared for
targeted advertisements and scam calls/
messages.

In order to put an end to the glob-
al coronavirus pandemic, researchers
around the world are working tire-
lessly to develop a vaccine to protect
against COVID-19. While vaccine
production usually takes multiple
years, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped
tobedevelopedwithin12-18months.
Vaccine testing can be split into 5
stages:
Pre-clinical – animal testing to see
whether the vaccine elicits an immune
response.
Phase I – healthy human volunteers
to determine safety and evaluate im-
mune response.
Phase II – hundreds of volunteers to
identify correct dosage.
Phase III – thousands of volunteers
to confirm safety and efficacy vs. a
placebo.
PhaseIV–studiesonadverseeffects,
long-term mmunity and vaccine us-
age following the approval and licens-
ing of the vaccine.
The WHO is currently tracking the
progress of over 170 candidate vac-
cines; at Felix, we’ve chosen 5 of the
most promising candidates to follow,
so watch this space!
New Update: Johnson & Johnson’s
clinical trials, including a Phase III
US trial, have been paused this week
due to an unexplained illness in a vol-
unteer.
