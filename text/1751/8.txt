The decision to institute a national
lockdown in the UK in response to
the coronavirus pandemic, announced
via televised address on the 23rd March,
came far too late.
Pandemics spread exponentially; as
more people get infected with a virus,
there is an even greater number of
people that the virus can infect, and if
that larger pool gets infected as well,
there is in turn an even bigger group
that the virus has access to. This expo-
nential growth is characterised by R, the
effective reproduction number. When
R is above 1, the pandemic is growing
exponentially. When it is below 1, it is
decaying exponentially. At a time where
R is above 1, decisions must be taken
proactively and decisively, because every
day the threat becomes substantially
greater than before.
Neil Ferguson, Imperial’s lead epide-
miologist who advised the government
in the early days of the pandemic, told
MPs on the Science and Technology
select committee that if the lockdown
had been instituted a week earlier, it
could’ve halved the death toll. The key
assumption for this estimate was based
on analysis that the epidemic was dou-
bling every three to four days – locking
down a week earlier would’ve been at a
time when infection rates were about
four times smaller than they were on
the day of lockdown. Unfortunately, a
lot of time was wasted on a faulty ‘herd
immunity’ strategy in the critical days of
the pandemic, as covered in last week’s
piece.
Care homes look after some of the
most vulnerable in our society, par-
ticularly those most at risk from COV-
ID-19 – the elderly, and particularly
those with dementia who may struggle
to adhere to new public health advice
through no fault of their own. In July,
statistics from the Office of National
Statistics (ONS) showed that 30,000
excess deaths took place in care homes
during the pandemic up to that point,
with COVID-19 being responsible for
two thirds of these. Previous work from
the ONS suggested that many of the
cases in the remaining third could also
be due to coronavirus.
But the government did little to
prevent it. In fact, their policies actively
encouraged it; in June it emerged that
until mid-April, NHS policy was to
discharge patients back into care homes
without needing a negative COV-
ID-19 test. This meant that many of
the patients discharged back could have
been carrying the virus straight into the
enclosed spaces where some of the
most vulnerable people live.
This was nothing less than
an extraordinary derelic-
tion of duty that was not
rectified until the peak of
the first wave.
As care homes are pri-
vatised, care home com-
panies have responsibil-
ity to procure adequate
personal protective
equipment (PPE) for
their staff. Shortages
of PPE in care homes
meant that both
staff and
resi-
dents
were
put at
increased risk of in-
fection. However, these companies
often shirked responsibility; the
youngest MP, Nadia Whittome,
spoke out about the shortage of
PPE at the care home she worked
at as a second job. She was promptly
sacked and accused of spreading misin-
formation by the care home, a claim that
proved false months later as the care
home admitted that they did indeed
have a shortage of PPE at the time.
While lockdown came too late, it’s
also possible that it lifted too early.
Experts, such as those from the Govern-
ment’s own Scientific Advisory Group
for Emergencies (SAGE), and those in a
letter published
by the British
Medical
Journal,
called for
lockdown
to be eased
much more
gradually,
coupled
with an
effective test and trace system. Profes-
sor Michael Baker of the University of
Otago, who advised on New Zealand’s
world renowned COVID response, also
echoed the same message.
Yet the Government was adamant
to see children returning to school in
June/July, despite it being the end of
the academic year, a period where not
much learning takes place anyway. The
Government also encouraged people
to return the office, despite there being
no need to do this for companies that
had adapted to operating remotely. This
encouragement further put workers
at risk, many of whom, particularly in
densely populated London, take public
transport to go to work.
Even more bizarrely, the Govern-
ment were quick to open pubs, and
their popular Eat Out to Help Out
scheme applied only to dine-in meals.
This incentivised people to crowd into
restaurants, many of which were not
even observing proper social distancing.
Queues formed outside of restaurants
in August as Britons flocked to get
half price discounts. Was the dine-in
stipulation really necessary for this
scheme? Surely the same restau-
rants could’ve gathered even
more profit if the Government
allowed the offer on takeaways,
reducing the burden on wait-
ing staff?
Public health
experts are gen-
erally unified
on the same
message: we
cannot rely on lock-
downs, the best way out of this
is to have an effective testing and trac-
ing system. That’s how New Zealand
and Vietnam have less coronavirus
cases than the White House, while
also experiencing a degree of return
to normality.
