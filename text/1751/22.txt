Dreams of Afrofuturism
Feature
Ifeel I should begin this article with a disclaimer. I do
not wish to share what you are about to read from
anything resembling a place of authority. As a white
guy coming from a tiny European
country with very little ethnic di-
versity, my education on race re-
lations, racism, and what it means
to come from a place of privilege
will be lifelong.
What I want to do, is share
with you the experience I have
had puzzling together some of
the pieces, mostly musical, some
literary, some historical, that I
have come to understand as indis-
pensable building blocks of one
of the most intriguing and life-af-
firming philosophical move-
ments I have ever come across. I
want to show you how learning
about Afrofuturism helped me
make sense not only of the music
that I love, but also some of the social dynamics that I
will never be able to understand first-hand.
My first glimpse of ideas related to Afrofuturism, al-
thoughnotexplicitly,cameintheshapeofabook,Mar-
lonJames’brilliantABriefHistoryofSevenKillings.It
is a tale of the bloody back-
drop of Kingston, Jamaica
from which sprang forth the
worldwide icon Bob Mar-
ley, only referred to in the
story as ‘The Singer’. What
I remember wondering at
were the regular references
to a ‘return to Africa’, a ‘re-
turn home’. Back then this
especially seemed foreign to
me – I did not understand
the brutal reality of the dis-
placement of millions of Af-
ricans during colonial times,
and the effect this had on
the subsequent generations.
This sort of pan-African
thinking, as I would later
learn, is a very important
aspect of the Rastafarian
ideology, which considers
repatriation to Africa an
ideal. But it turns out that
the reestablishment of a
spiritual connection with
Africa, most crucially its pre-colonial cultural heritage,
is a common theme in Afrofuturism as well. A very viv-
id illustration of this notion is recognisable in the most
prominent example of Afrofuturism today, perhaps
ever – the superhero film Black Panther. Its protago-
nist, first appearing in comic books
towards the tail end of the civil rights
movement, embodies the pillars of
Afrofuturism: pride, justice, progress,
and a unique and all-encompassing
African spirit.
A more ubiquitous clue for finding
suchconnectionstothepastinartcan
be found everywhere we look. If there
was one thing that I learned from my
saxophone teacher, it was the impor-
tance of black people, especially black
Americans, for modern music. Many
of the complexities, both rhythmic
and melodic, of Jazz and Blues were
completely revolutionary and foreign
to the European musical tradition.
Trickling down through the centuries
of slavery and oppression, it is a won-
der they even survived, yet they set the course for how
music would develop in the 20th century.
In my opinion, the best words for this need to
reconnect with a collective future stolen from Afri-
cans centuries ago, come from the man who coined
the term himself, Mark Dery. He asks how “a com-
munity whose past has been deliberately rubbed out
… [can] imagine possible futures?”. This closes the
circle of time,
illustrating
the inherent-
ly positivis-
tic nature of
Afrofuturis-
tic thought.
It does not
concern itself
with only the
past or the fu-
ture in isola-
tion, but aims
to encompass
elements of
them both,
along with
the some-
times-harsh
realities of
the present, to
imagine a bet-
ter world for black communities.
Emma Dabiri, the Nigerian-Irish author, empha-
sizes the same ideals of Afrofuturism. She relates
them to the Oriki form of poetry, a form of expres-
sion for Yoruba speakers
in Western Africa. In her
BBC radio 4 episode, titled
Journeys in Afrofuturism,
she claims that “much of
[Oriki’s] power lies in its
ability to collapse concrete
distinctions between past,
present, and future”. It is a
beautiful analogy, and one
which explains why Afro-
futurist art is so eclectic. If
we take Jazz and Blues to
be the gift of African tradi-
tion passed down through
centuries of oppression,
this particular musical
circle of time is closed by
Jimmy Hendrixplugging
in his electric guitar and
producing the kinds of
space-age psychedelic ex-
plorations that no guitar
player had managed be-
fore.
It was an obsession with
HOW CAN A
COMMUNITY
WHOSE PAST
HAS BEEN
DELIBERATELY
RUBBED OUT
… IMAGINE
POSSIBLE
FUTURES?
“ IN SO MANY
IMAGININGS OF
THE FUTURE,
IN SO MUCH
SCIENCE
FICTION, THERE
WERE NO BLACK
PEOPLE AT
ALL—WHICH […]
MAKES NO SENSE
