Prince William
launches £50
million Earthshot
Prize to award
climate solutions
The Earthshot Prize aims to award
the most promising solutions to
climate change and other environmental
issues over the next ten years. Starting
next year, a panel of judges, called the
‘Earthshot Prize Council’ which in-
cludes venerated nature presenter Sir
David Attenborough, will decide on
an annual basis the five individuals or
organisations with the solutions most
deserving of a £1 million prize.
The website of the Earthshot Prize
states that a ‘distinguished panel of
experts’ will shortlist the nominations,
while the Council will make the final
decisions on the winners. Further detail
on this panel of experts is not given.
Notably this council does not include
any climate scientists or academics of
a related field. While it
includes a climate
activist, a nature
presenter,
and two
people with
climate-re-
lated NGO
experience, it
also includes
two royals, two
business leaders,
two sportsmen, an
astronaut, an actress,
and Shakira. While it is
a positive that
influential peo-
ple are on board
with finding
climate solutions,
one may wonder
why climate scientists were
left out and what experi-
ence and knowledge this panel will
draw from in order to select the most
promising solutions.

The three-tier lockdown system
Ansh Bhatnagar Science Editor
With a second wave encroaching, Boris Johnson announced a new three-tier restriction system
for England that came into force on Wednesday. Felix breaks it down.
There are three levels to the new sys-
tem: medium, high, and very high.
Medium restrictions (colour coded
yellow on the map) demand adherence
to the rule of six (both indoors and out-
doors) as well as the closure of pubs and
restaurants at 10pm. The vast majority
of the country, including London, is
currently under this category.
High level restrictions (orange) ban
all indoor household mixing with the
rule of six still applying outdoors. This
applies to areas in the North East and
North West of England, such as the
Manchester city region, Newcastle, and
Durham.
Very high level restric-
tions (red) demand the
closure of hospitality
and entertainment
venues that don’t
serve food, as
well as
household mixing in private outdoor
spaces, such as gardens. It is notable
that these highest level restrictions
are still less strict than the original
lockdown conditions.
As of Wednesday, the very
high restrictions apply only to
the Liverpool city region.
As Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland are de-
volved nations, differ-
ent systems of
restrictions
apply to
them.

London update
On Wednesday morning it was an-
nounced that local leaders of Greater
Manchester and Lancashire were in
talks with the Government that may see
those regions move up to the ‘Very high’
restrictions, while London and Essex are
confirmed to be moving up to the ‘High’
restrictions. The decision to move Lon-
don to the higher tier of restrictions was
supported by Mayor Sadiq Khan.
The new restrictions in London will
see all indoor household mixing banned,
as explained above. These restrictions
officially come into effect at midnight on
Friday.
Please stay safe and follow the rules by
avoiding meeting people you do not live
with.
