Should we really be picking
wild mushrooms?
Irecently had a boundary-breaking
experience during a moment of
inter-species reconnection.
Recently I visited my
local woodland and had
the luck of coming across
wild herbs, nuts and veg-
etables. Overjoyed at the
discovery, I foraged a stem
of fennel, plus a couple
of small courgettes and
their bright yellow flow-
ers making sure to leave plenty for
others to enjoy. Once back at home I
noticed I cooked the
plants with more
care than usual, the
flavours were so
much more com-
plex, stimulating
a new variation of
stomach neurons
and blessing the
diversity of my
gut flora. But how
sustainable is it for
people without a
real necessity to
forage and hunt
wild foods?
Eating wild
foods makes more
apparent our
relation to other
species with whom
we share the earth, reminding us that
we too are wild nature. Having this
connection is vital, as scholar Gina
Rae La Cerva writes, ‘to be alienated
from wild nature is
to be alienated from
ourselves’. Foraging
wild foods allows us
to comprehend the
complex connec-
tions of an ecosys-
tem and millions
of years of evolu-
tion that led to the
growth of something we can eat.
As we are increasingly living in
urban and suburban settings without
any connection to wildness, most
of us live in a state of disconnection
from other species, and experiencing
wildness has now become a luxury.
Yet this connection is
so vital as studies on
biophilia have shown
how exposure to wild-
ness reduces stress and
anxiety and increases
happiness.
Most of us do not
rely on wild foods for
subsistence, so the wild food resur-
gence we see, especially in the Global
North, is not out of need but appetite.
As we long for a sense
of wildness no
longer present
in our lives,
wild foods have
become fetish-
ised and com-
modified as a
delicacy.
Wild foods
now being a
luxury item is
a product of
disaster capi-
talism, which
has ended
up ultimate-
ly destroying
most wild areas
and created the
marketisation
of all aspects of life. If this wasn’t
problematic enough, niche markets
of wild foods are actually destructive
to ecosystems in the way they harvest
crops or animals, and the irregularity
of nature is incompatible with indus-
trial growth.
The trend of picking wild mush-
rooms has really grown over the past
decade with an increasing number
of commercial collectors ransack-
ing whole woodlands of their fungal
species. Not only does this removal
cause negative short-term effects on
the populations of fungi, but it also
damages the woodland long-term, as
fungi have so many interconnected
roles in maintaining the functioning
of an ecosystem such as recycling nu-
trients, being a host for invertebrates
and providing food source to animals.
Epping Forest in London is known
for having an abundance of mush-
rooms some years, but the Forestry
Services of London highly advise
against people foraging, 'We welcome
people visiting the forest
and admiring the many
fascinating shapes, forms
and colours the fungi
world has to offer, but
please leave them there
for the next visitor and
future generations to enjoy.’
It is not viable for us all to depend
on wild foods; however, we can re-
wild our agricultural systems through
the incorporation regenerative princi-
ples and increasing species diversity.
At the same time, we can improve
accessibility to healthy foods to create
abundance and mutual thriving for
all. This action of transformation is
necessary for food and environmental
justice, and it isn’t a problem for the
future, change is needed now.
Our current global agricultural
system does not serve to provide for
all as it was designed for profit-mak-
ing from the beginning of industrial-
isation. Climate change is decreasing
agricultural yields, so in some parts
of the world, wild foods are essential
for food security. One million people
around the globe depend on wild
foods for sub-
sistence, which
are mainly
procured by
women bear-
ing essential
ecological knowledge, and a much
deeper understanding of the cycles of
networks that feed and water us.
So, if we don’t depend on wild
foods for subsistence, from time to
time it is ok to pick the occasional
blackberry to eat yourself, but we
should not be supporting the marke-
tisation of wild plants, animals and
fungi as we have already taken too
many fish from the sea.

the Wild podcast hosted by Ayana

Organisation: Fibershed (www.fibershed.org)
On the theme of wildness, I would like to spotlight one organisation in par-
ticular that is inspiring the textile industry to strive for sustainability, and at its
core has re-wilding principles seen in practice as regenerative agriculture.
The project began in 2010 when Rebecca Burgess wanted to reduce the
environmental impact of her wardrobe. And so began the challenge to source
dyes, fibres and labour within 150 miles of the project's headquarters. After a
couple of months, the project became a movement and now Fibershed works
in developing regional and regenerative fibre systems on behalf of independent
producers, implementing carbon farming, rebuilding regional manufacturing
and connecting end-users with farms.
The ultimate aim is to create ‘climate-beneficial’ clothing, utilising the ‘soil to
soil’ principle, and to educate the public on the benefits of decentralising the
textile supply chain by creating a regenerative textile economy.
EATING WILD
FOOD MAKES
MORE APPARENT
OUR RELATION TO
OTHER SPECIES
WITH WHOM WE
SHARE THE EARTH
REMINDING US
THAT WE TOO ARE
WILD NATURE.
