I was lucky (I will leave it
to my readers to decide
if they agree with the
word choice) to be in
the Felix Office over
looking Beit Quad
at 7am on Thursday
morning when the
Beit fire alarm went
off, driving students
into the cold in their pa-
jamas dressing gowns and masks.
What could have been a great oppor-
tunity to moan about the situation
and how sleepy you were with friends
was turned into a strangely silent
affair. Beit students stood spread out
in the quad like mutually repellent
magnets or the whole school morn-
ing exercise classes you sometimes
see in Chinese schools.
I hope that they are alright.
This will be a year that many will
dine out on in the future. They were
the ones that really experienced the
very worst of protracted lockdown,
ensconsed for better or for worse,
and strangely silent.
That is what concerns me the most.
As I watched them gather in the
quad, they did not complain or
chat or congregate or do anything.
They stood stoically, resigned and
silent. I hope that they are building
links. When I hear stories of
gatherings in Hyde park,
my heart soars. Bravo. I
hope you all have some
stories to tell when
people ask you what it
was like all those years
in the future.
As London descends
once more into a period
of rule tightening, studies
and articles, some published in these
very pages, suggest that things are
only going to get worse, however I
call on first years and other students
to restrain themselves and consider
the health of the wider population. A
very dear friend of mine refused all
throughout the summer to come out
despite appeals from all his friends.
His reasoning was simple “If a single
person were to be hurt as a result
of my actions I could never forgive
myself ” he would repeat over and
over. I think this is a valuable lesson
for all of us. I have seen people close
to me have their ideas of what the
future was going to look like cruelly
and suddenly torn away from them
and it is not a fate I would wish upon
my worst enemy. As paternalistic
rules return and grow stricter, let us
all show personal responsibility, the
most powerful response to fussing.

Why do bad things hap-

The Felix Editor on
Keep the Cat at all costs
The paper is in a difficult situation.
For those that have been struggling
to access Felix like they would have
I can only apologise. We have tried
to get a website off the ground and
ready but there are still teething
problems. Unfortunately, ironically
if many people do get to read this, it
will be on the ready and completed
website, rendering the article void of
meaning. However, I believe that it
is important that we, as a newspaper
with aspirations to represent the stu-
dent voice, and I, as the newspaper’s
representative, speak honestly to
you. We are finding this year diffi-
cult. With our writers and editors
mainly working from home, we are
in some ways a shadow of our former
self. However, simultaneously, we
have produced in the last two weeks
what I would say are some of the best
papers I have ever seen put out by
Felix. Thank you writers and editors
of Felix. We shall perservere.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-ups and paternalistic
obfuscation are never right and that
as intelligent people, students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
