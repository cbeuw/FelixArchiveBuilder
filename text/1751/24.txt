Afrofuturism and 20th century jazz – Sun Ra. The
other reference is in the cover of the album. Cham-
pioning a black woman with an afro on a cosmic
black background, it seems rather like a nod to the
cover of Funkadelic’s Maggot Brain and its master-
mind, George Clinton.
Both were crucial in the develop-
ment of the Afrofuturist aesthetic.
Sun Ra and his Arkestra regular-
ly performed in an eccentric mix
of ancient Egyptian and space age
clothing, whereas Funkadelic (along
with Parliament, the other half of
Clinton’s futuristic collective) cham-
pioned cover art and outfits can
only be described as space cowboy
fashion. Boots, leather, and denim,
as well as face paint and brightly
coloured futuristic accessories all
combined to emphasize the psyche-
delic sounds.
The philosophy of Sun Ra is rath-
er complex, even bordering on neb-
ulous, but it is a single quote that, to
me, most powerfully elucidates the
role of the present day in Afrofuturism. It comes
from the 1974 film called Space is the Place, where
he announces, “I do not come to you as a reality, I
come to you as the myth because that’s what black
people are, myths.” To this I add the epic opening
lines from Maggot Brain – “Mother earth is preg-
nant for the third time // For y’all have knocked her
up // I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the
universe// I was not offended //
For I knew I had to rise above it
all // Or drown in my own shit”.
No words could illustrate the
disillusionment of marginaliza-
tion better. But they did not stop
at mere words. Sun Ra’s spirit of
jazz exper-
imentation
still echoes
t h r o u g h
much of

and elec-

sic, while

M o n a e ’ s
cover art
for Arch-
Android seeming particularly
influenced by it. George Clin-
ton’s and P-Funk’s legacy in De-
troit, meanwhile, still soldiers
on. Clinton himself might have
moved on to other things, but the
spirit of Parliament/Funkadelic
was revitalized in the 80s by the
pioneers of Electro Funk,
which was incredibly influ-
ential in the development of
techno.
And so, we have arrived
back to Detroit, the city
which could be called the
Mecca of all modern black
music. We have closed the
circle of time, in the way
of Oriki. There is much to
learn from Afrofuturism,
and even more to marvel
at. I hope that you, like
me, will use this article as
a platform to learn more
about it. Any and all of
the artists in the article
are a good place to start
but I’m quite confident
that you can now identi-
fy many examples of your
own who exhibit the same
mentality. In the end, the
common element is the
drive to dream of a bet-
ter, equally representative
future for all people. Is that not a dream we
should all share
AND SO, WE HAVE
ARRIVED BACK
TO DETROIT,
THE CITY
WHICH COULD
BE CALLED THE
MECCA OF ALL
MODERN BLACK
