There are lots of things I have missed
in lockdown that I previously had
taken for granted, and that feeling when
you manage to get gig tickets for an in-
timate show that goes on sale at 9:00am
but sells out by 8:58 is pretty near the
top of the list. So, when I missed the
ticket sale for Spector playing a small,
socially distanced gig to celebrate DIY
magazine’s 100th issue, only to find out
my friend had got me a ticket, the dopa-
mine rush was pretty sweet.
Spector are one of the bands that
soundtracked my
teenage life, and to
be honest, they prob-
ably still do. Even
though they haven’t
released an album in
5years,thebandhave
come out with some
of their best songs to
date through three
EPs in the last two
years, and released a
compilation album
of these EPs titled
‘Non-Fiction’ on vi-
nyl on April 29th
this year. Frontman
Fred Macpherson
has cemented him-
self as one of the
most criminally un-
derrated lyricists in
songs like ‘Untitled in D’ and ‘Half Life’,
where he sings over catchy synth riffs
about the anxiety surrounding life in the
digital-age. There could not have been a
better band to see for a first post-lock-
down gig.
My first socially
distanced gig was
reminiscent of my
first standing gig as
a teenager - feeling
a bit awkward whilst
not being quite sure
how you should
dance or what you
should do with your
arms. This feeling
was clearly shared,
with Macpherson
remarking, “stop
pretending like you
didn’t wake up at
8am to be in the
only 75 people here,”
at the lack of socially
distanced dancing.
Macpherson’s cha-
risma pours through in both the band’s
flawless performance, and in the way
he engages and jokes with the crowd in
between songs. The set list spanned the
band’s discography, from crowd-pleas-
ing singles, to rarely played, mellow
fan-favourite, ‘Kyoto Garden’, and the
band were joined by the Magic Gang
frontman Jack Kaye, for ‘Never Fade
Away’. The experience was surreal, and
it was clear everybody there was excit-
ed to be seeing live music again after 6
months, and knew the set inside out. It
isatestamenttothebandthatthey were
able to make a socially distanced gig
feel more intimate than most gigs were
pre-lockdown, and, with it being their
last show for a little while, I cannot wait
to be back in the mosh pit for ‘Chevy
Thunder’ when they return.

“
The Wytches have returned with
‘White Cliffs’, the 4th single from
their upcoming 3rd album, Three Mile
Ditch. The four-piece band had disap-
peared since releasing their sophomore
album Annabel Dream Reader in 2016,
only briefly reappearing to release Hal-
loween singles ‘Double World’ and
‘Double World – Sludge Version’. The
band pulled out of a much anticipated
slot supporting Drenge on a UK tour,
and finished the year with just a small
handful of intimate UK shows. How-
ever, The Wytches’ long awaited return
was confirmed in June 2020, with the re-
lease of lead album single ‘Cowboy’, and
confirmation of their 3rd album in July.
After a four-year hiatus, leaving
Heavenly Records for their own label
Cable Code Records, and losing found-
ing member of the band Gianni Honey,
The Wytches are back.
White Cliffs’ is slower than a typi-
cal song by The Wytches, however it
still contains the band’s characteristic
moody vocals, dark and infectious riffs,
and gritty, grungy sounds. Frontman
Kristian Bell said of the single,“It was a
track I didn’t really think would work as
a Wytches song. When trying out new
ideas, it’s easy to tell when a song isn’t
working even if it sounded like a typical
Wytches thing. This one really didn’t re-
semble something we’d do but we all re-
ally connected when playing it together.”
It is to the band’s great credit that they
are able to maintain a unique and char-
acteristic sound instantly identifiable
as The Wytches, whilst still developing
themselves sonically.
Catch The Wytches at their social-
ly-distanced album release show at Ko-
media, Brighton on 30th October for
£15.
Three Mile Ditch will be released on
the 30th October on Cable Code Re-
cords.
