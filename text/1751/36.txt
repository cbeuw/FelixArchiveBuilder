An active investment strategy re-
quires, as the name suggests, an
individual, usually a portfolio manag-
er, to make decisions about buying and
selling shares on a daily basis. Given the
constant fluctuations in equity prices,
especially in uncertain economic times
such as this one, an active approach can
exceed the stock market’s average re-
turns. In order for this method to suc-
ceed, thorough analysis and knowledge
in particular market sectors is essential.
That is the reason why a portfolio man-
ager usually works with a team of ana-
lysts responsible for predicting which
asset’s price will change and when. An
undeniable advantage of this approach
is the flexibility that it offers. Active in-
vestment managers can buy equity from
promising companies, which have ei-
ther recently entered the market or have
undergone changes which made them
more competitive, at a moment’s notice.
In contrast, passive investing aims for
a long-term profitability, which means
selling and buying equity occurs rarely.
This stems from the buy-and-hold phi-
losophy, which is opposed to attempting
to predict the market’s next move. There
are two main ways of investing passively.
The first is to invest in and retain blue
chip stocks. Those companies’ stock is
deemed relatively safe because they have
a strong reputation for remaining prof-
itable, even during periods of recession.
However, purchasing an index fund,
which is a type of security that tracks a
major stock market index, such as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, is the
most prevalent strategy.
A market index is defined as a hypo-
thetical investment portfolio which in-
cludes companies in a particular sector,
such as software and energy. The exist-
ence of multiple indices is attributed to
the different mathematical methodolo-
gies used to create an index. Each meth-
odology calculates the index’s values by
weighing parameters such as stock price
and market capitalization differently. In-
dex funds track the market’s trajectory
by selling equity from firms no longer
included in the index and purchasing
stock entering the index. This strategy
results in a significantly lower number
of transactions occurring compared to
active investing.
The key ben-
efit is the reduc-
tion in fees and
risk. Given that
no team is re-
quired to man-
age the portfolio,
there are no la-
bour costs asso-
ciated with the
analysts’ salaries
and transaction
feesarelowerdue
to fewer trans-
actions happening. Risk is lowered be-
cause owning a miniscule piece of stock
from thousands of consistently profita-
ble firms results in the accumulation of
returns over a long
time period. How-
ever, as historical
trends have shown,
the decrease in risk
leads to smaller re-
turns, which tend to
be close to the mar-
ket average. The buy
and hold mentality
of passive investing
suggests that index
funds may be slower
to sell under-per-
forming stock than active investors.
The debate between active and pas-
sive investing will not be settled- and
there’s no reason for it to be concluded
since their advantages can be combined
in a single strategy. This turbulent year,
which will be marked by COVID-19
and its effects on the global economy
and the US Presidential election, has
caused prolonged uncertainty but also
created potential new opportunities.
In particular, a Joe Biden victory
would prove beneficial to the renewable
sector due to his proposed plan of a $2
trillion investment in building clean en-
ergy infrastructure. The US’ stance on
the Climate Paris accord emission tar-
gets would also shift, which would make
investing in green companies enticing.
A Take on the Active vs Passive Equities
Another area where significant
policy changes may occur is
trade. A potential Biden ad-
ministrationisexpectedtotake
steps to de-escalate tensions
with China and the European
Union by working to reduce
tariffs.
This will prove beneficial to
European car markers and US
companies which export their
products primarily to China.
On the other hand, a Trump
re-election would renew con-
fidence in oil and gas shares as
these firms would avoid stricter
regulations and potential tax
increases on account of their
environmental impact. What
seems of greater concern to
the investment community and
certainly the majority of econ-
omists is the approval of an
economic stimulus package.
Specifically, the current im-
passe prolongs uncertainty
about the state of the economy.
Consequently, unless an agree-
ment is reached before Elec-
tion Day, it will be important
to see if one party gains unified
control of the government.
The longer that the bill is de-
layed , the more severe the
downturn will be due to a wave
of business bankruptcies and
defaults on retail and corpo-
rate loans. With an active in-
vestment approach, one could
profit significantly from sell-
ing stock of firms expected to
be positively affected by either
candidate’s policy platform.
However, if the election out-
come leads to neither party
controlling all branches of gov-
ernment, legislation regarding
either the stimulus bill or other
issues, such as the environment
and trade, will become difficult
to pass, which alters expecta-
tions completely.
Under this scenario, the pas-
sive approach may yield better
returns.
Some policy changes to look out for?
