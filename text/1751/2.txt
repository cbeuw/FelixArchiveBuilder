The governmental Scientific Adviso-
ry Group for Emergencies (SAGE)
body called for all university teaching to
be fully online 4 weeks ago.
Minutes of the 21st September meeting
of SAGE, released on Monday suggest
“All university and college teaching to be
online unless face to face teaching is abso-
lutely essential”
Although this body only reports to the
government and can make no policy and
has no power beyond making suggestions,
it is clear that the government was warned
that student areas would be hotspots of
COVID-19 as the large influx of students
in close proximity lead to numerous trans-
mission events.
The Times investigation into this has
shown that SAGE’s fears have been shown
to be well founded with areas of Manches-
ter and Nottingham, both which included
large student populations, having 1 in 20
people infected. The national average at
the time was 1 in 240 infected.
When queried about this, an Imperial
College London spokesperson said: “Im-
perial’s STEM focus requires in-person
access to labs and specialist equipment.
While we are moving much of our teach-
ing and learning online, we have also
developed COVID-safe forms of in-per-
son teaching, which remain essential to an
Imperial education.
“On-campus teaching - such as labora-
tory work - will be delivered in a COV-
ID-secure way for as long as government
guidance allows and virus transmission
among our community remains within
local public health thresholds.”
While the government did issue ad-
ditional guidelines on the reopening of
university buildings, the government has
made a comittment to keeping education-
al facilities open, even in the case of a Tier
3 London-local lockdown.
The recent government update that
places London into a Tier 2 local lock-
down in response to elevated infection
levels due to begin at midnight of 16th
October will not affect teaching.

Calum Drysdale Editor in Chief
worry for the year to come, saying that the
issues “added to the already stressful on-
line university experience”. Another noted
that “the one thing you expect from this
year is to be able to watch your lectures, so
when even that breaks it’s
not a good sign”. With
support amongst the na-
tional student body for
reduced fees in the face
of the pandemic growing
– one online petition has
garnered almost 150,000
signatures – it’s no
surprise that many feel
ripped off by the quality
of the service.
In response to the
technical difficulties, a
spokesperson for Imperi-
al College London said,
“we are very sorry for
the disruption students experienced in the
first week of term and we share their frus-
tration”. They said that Panopto, which is
used as a lecture capture service by univer-
sities nationwide, experienced “capacity
issues with their cloud infrastructure”. The
resulting outage affected Imperial and oth-
er universities across the country. Never-
theless, the College
assures students
that “Panopto
have now fixed the
issue after major
upgrade work was
brought forward
from December
and have apolo-
gised to their uni-
versity clients and
students affected.”
“Given the
importance of
remote learning
this academic year
we will be keep-
ing a close eye on the performance of our
recommended digital learning platforms
going forward.”
