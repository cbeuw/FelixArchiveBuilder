tice that Imperial had been doing and
the fact that Strathclyde are not known
as a university that typically performs
well the competition, he and his team
mates were shaken by being on camera.
For the whole team it was the first time
they had been on television and Michael
admitted that it rattled them. Questions
covered topics including river deltas, art,
Atlanta based hip-hop and the bones of
the human body.
The two teams started out equally,
each team getting a starter question but
Strathclyde soon pulled away, claiming
starter question after question until they
had an imposing lead of over 100 points.
A late rally by the Imperial team was not
enough to close the gap however and
the programme ended with the Imperial
team on 155 and the Strathclyde team
on 190.
The two teams had a major difference
in ages. The average age of the Imperial
team was 19 and all the
team were undergradu-
ates while the Strathclyde
team included three post-
grads and had an average
age of 29.
We then moved on to
talking about how Mi-
chael had himself got into
quizzing. Unlike what
I expected, he was not
a long term University
Challenge fanatic but had
instead joined the quiz
society at the beginning
of last year and having
been selected for the team
in November he and his
fellow teams mates had 4
months to prepare for the
filming of the first round
which happened in Feb-
ruary (and was broadcast
in August). Although
filming was planned to
continue through March
and April the COVID-19 pandemic put
a stop to that meaning that numerous
episodes of the competition remain un-
filmed.
The other members of the Imperial
team are Justin Wong
(2nd Year Maths), Ka-
tie Marrow (3rd year
Physics) and Imran
Rahman (4th year
Physics). Michael ex-
plained how each
member of the team
had an area of expertise
that they cultivated in
order to complement
the team as a whole.
The specialisations are
as follows : Justin Wong
- history & geography,
Katie Marrow -
word-based questions,
the natural world and
what Michael referred
to as “weird shit” (Ka-
tie being the only mem-
ber of the team to get
a question right in a
round about the names
of different types of
windows), Michael
Kohn - literature and fine arts and Imran
Rahman - social sciences, films, classical
music.
Micheal explained that the team
trained hard for the competition by
trawling through Wikipedia, practis-
ing by watching old rounds and seeing
if they could buzz in before the people
on the screen and curating flashcard lists
on Anki, an app often used by medics
to remember drug names and anatomy.
When I asked if he would be willing to
share these lists with students, he po-
litely refused saying that “curating and
creating these lists is the most important
part of the process”.
