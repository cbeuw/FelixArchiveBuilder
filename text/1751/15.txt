In response to budget shortages the college has de-
cided to replace all academic teaching staff with
black-cab drivers. This decision came after anonymous
College sources called academics “jumped up, spoiled
wastes of space”. According to Christian Peeler, Vice
Provost (Education), it was realised that as black-cab
drivers are experts in all topic of conversation they
were better value as generalists than the incredibly lim-
ited range of most academics. Some problems with the
confidence of the new hires were encountered when
they tried speaking in front of large crowds. However,
this was addressed by College building replica black-
cab driver’s seats facing away from the video cameras
from which the new lecturers would be able to deliv-
er over the-the-shoulder teaching to their students.
When NegaFelix contacted the College to enquire as
to where the new lecturers were found it was explained
that the terminal decline of the London tourist sector
had forced many black cab drivers to retrain, leading to
a temporary glut in the employment market allowing
the College to snap up teaching staff at record low pric-
es. Feb Senton, second year biology, described the dif-
ference in the teaching styles between the former and
current teaching staff.
“Last year, the professors were so stuffy. They had a
hugelistofthingsthatwejustHADtolearnandthings
that we had to think. They were against the idea of us
coming up with our own answers to the big questions
like ‘what is quantum physics?’. There has also been
a relaxation of the citation policy. Suddenly ‘I think
someone told me something similar once a long time
ago and I don’t know if I properly remember what they
said’ is a valid source.”
Unfortunately, the new lecturers are already coming
under pressure from a recently developed app. Uber
Lecturers (UL) developed by Imperial computer sci-
ence students promises to deliver lecturers cheaper and
faster, all of whom will agree with everything you say
on the condition that you give them a 5 star rating.
