Last week’s
solution
trial cards to get into the GB team.
Somehow made it to the top of the list
and was subsequently selected! In full-
bore,itwasadifferentstory.Ihadn’tshot
fullbore in a year, rocked up, had a bit of
a breakdown (due to the traumatic event
that happened in March), but still man-
aged to shoot well on 2 of the 4 days, and
subsequently won the Young Rifleman’s
Aggregate! In some ways, although I’m
very sorry to hear of the people affect-
ed by the current coronavirus outbreak,
COVID has been a blessing in disguise
for me. It has given me the chance to
take a step back and slow down, focusing
on relationships (with my dog), and ena-
bled me to improve my mental health by
not placing so much pressure on myself.
What’s your favourite thing to do
outside of sport or university work?
Socialize with food! The sports I do
are pretty individual, so it’s incredibly
important for my mental health to speak
and socialize with friends. Hong Kong
culture is based entirely around food, so
I just love getting together with friends
over good food. What advice do you have for aspir-
ing athletes?
Keep your chin up! You’re already do-
ing really well by participating in sport
alongside an Imperial degree! Be sure
to manage your time well and remem-
ber that recovery is just as important as
training. Learn to enjoy and trust the
process, and remember it’s about what
you learn along the way, and not the out-
come.
If you have been through
a traumatic experience,
then please do reach out
to somebody who is in
a position to help. This
can either be your tutor,
a counsellor or even a
friend. At the end of the
day your health, specifi-
cally your mental health,
is one of the most impor-
tant things to maintain in
life so make sure you pri-
oritise it.
If you know of somebody who you think we should interview
about their sporting achievements, no matter what sport, then
please do get in touch at Sports.felix@imperial.ac.uk
