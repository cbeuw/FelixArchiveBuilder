What follows is a few questions I put
to one of imperials most high perform-
ing athlete, Christy Chan, who recently
became a GB athlete in two very differ-
ent sports:
Who are you?
Hi everyone! I’m Christy, a third
year EIE undergraduate. I’m from
Hong Kong, and went to an Interna-
tional school there, Hong Kong Inter-
national School. When I was thirteen,
I moved to the UK to attend boarding
school, Sevenoaks School. However, I
disliked boarding at the school so be-
came a day pupil shortly after. I compete
in two sports, target rifle shooting and
powerlifting. In target rifle shooting, I
compete in two disciplines, smallbore
and fullbore. I was recently selected to
compete for Great Britain in the Drew
Match, an international smallbore prone
rifle competition for U21’s. This year, in
fullbore, I won the Young Rifleman’s Ag-
gregate (best scores for my class at 300
yards, 500 yards, and 600 yards). In pow-
erlifting, I was also recently selected to
compete for Great Britain in the World
Junior Bench Press Championships, in
the u52kg category, but this fell through
due to COVID.
What’s your sport background?
I started shooting when I was thirteen
at Sevenoaks, as a hobby and as some-
thing to fill time and to distract me from
being homesick. I did this once a week
for two years, until year eleven, where I
chose it as my ‘sports option’ meaning I
did it three or more times a week. I was
pretty bad at shooting for the first four
years, until in my final year of school, it
all just clicked, and I suddenly got much
better, being selected for England in the
Schools’ match.
When I joined Imperial, using the
facilities provided by Imperial College
Rifle & Pistol Club, I used the knowl-
edge I acquired over the past few years
totryandimprovewithoutanycoaching
or help, which was difficult, but I per-
severed! In my first year, I came 6th in
female BUCS short
range, and last year
I came 2nd beating
some GB shots as
well! In my last year
of school, I needed
something to fill in
the time during my
free periods. Instead
of spending all of my
time at the shooting
range, I decided to go
to the gym – it was
nothing serious until
I joined ICBarbell at
university. In second
year, I continued powerlifting, and with
the support of my coach and ICBarbell,
I was able to make progress, competing
in my first competition in January 2020,
qualifying for British Junior Nationals,
and National Bench Press Champion-
ships. I competed in the bench press
championships in February 2020, came
2nd in my weight class, and was subse-
quently selected for GB!
How do you balance university and
sport?
To be perfectly honest with you, I
don’t know. I meticulously plan my time
and try to stay organized and on top of
things. I do tend to wake up at a decent
time, and just get grinding away at work/
training.
Have you ever experienced racism
or sexism in the world of sport?
In powerlifting, in
short, no. ICBarbell is
a super diverse club, we
have a 60% female com-
mittee! I am super glad
to see this, and the fact
that we have come so far
as a new club (founded
in 2016), to the extent
where I have never expe-
rienced racism or sexism
in powerlifting.
In shooting, it’s a dif-
ferent story. People in
the sport tend to come
from private school
backgrounds, so everyone in the sport
tends to be posh, white, and mostly
male. Smallbore more so than fullbore;
last year in the National Smallbore Rifle
Association’s Bisley Meeting, I was the
only person of colour on camp, and was
subsequently interviewed for their vid-
eo!
Saying this, I have not not felt wel-
comed – there are just a few times where
the odd racist joke or comment comes
out, without a modern-day filter! In
fullbore, although the majority are as
I described above, there’s a lot more
diversity. The people around are very
supportive and always willing to help,
and racism/sexism is very much less of
a thing than you would expect! How-
ever, I must add that being a female in
two male dominated sports is quite chal-
lenging. You have to assert yourself, oth-
erwise you’ll be forgotten and trampled
over! As long as you act confidently, you
should be perfectly fine!
How has COVID affected your life?
In March, when things started getting
worse with COVID, I flew back home
to Hong Kong. Just prior to this, I was
still entered into some competitions, so
decided to shoot all of them in one day.
Here, in the midst of all the stress, I was
sexually assaulted by a coach at the time.
I said nothing and finished my shooting,
because I had a flight to catch in 4 hours.
It severely impacted me and I underwent
therapy to try and overcome this. I am
in the process of recovering. Gun laws
in Hong Kong are extremely strict, so I
wasn’t able to shoot. During my manda-
tory 14 day home quarantineI thought I
could just wait and come back to train-
ing at the gym , however the gyms closed
due to a second wave! I had to make do
with a pull up bar and some resistance
bands, but needless to say, I lost a lot of
strength.
When the gyms reopened again in
April, I went hard, and nearly injured
myself squatting. I kept going at it
though, set a new PB, and then the gyms
closed again (third wave). The gyms
were closed until I came back to the UK
at the beginning of September, for some
Imperial star athlete selected to represent
Great Britain in two different sports
