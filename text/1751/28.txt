Motivation is overrated.
We all have good inten-
tions, intentions that don’t mani-
fest into results. We all may want
to: build muscle, do more cardio,
read more books, or even write
regular blog posts. However,
when trying to build a new
habit or develop a new skill,
one often falls into the trap
of thinking big. Big goals,
big steps, big to do lists, big
purchases to facilitate your
big new habit. James Clear’s
Atomic Habits,’; however, at-
tempts to steer people away
from being helplessly ‘con-
sumed by the end goal,’ voic-
ing that ‘one push-up is bet-
ter than not exercising …
and it’s better to do less than
you hoped than to do noth-
ing at all.’ And Clear raises
a good point: ‘we rarely think
about change this way,’ and it’ll do
us all some good if we practiced
this approach when developing
habits. So, let me indulge you in
some ideas I found noteworthy in
Clear’s treasure trove of knowl-
edge on building good habits, and
breaking the bad.
The crux of the book is this:
‘Habits are the compound interest
of personal development.’ Achiev-
ing something remarkable or de-
veloping a good habit and quitting
a bad one requires incremental
change. This idea is persistent
throughout Clear’s text. What was
both fascinating and worrying
was the fact that we know this. We
know that ‘practice makes per-
fect’, and anything worth doing
requires painful patience. Clear’s
writing, however, makes one in-
ternalise these cliches profoundly.
Clear explores in strenuous detail
the significance of ‘Atomic Hab-
its’, using person-
al examples from
his own life and of
course, an ample
amount of mag-
nificent metaphors that further
help one digest the importance of
habits.
Three ideas I found unique
and worthy of sharing were: the
2-minute rule, identity-based
habits and the downside of habits
– yes there are downsides!
The two-minute rule
The two-minute rule was a par-
ticular favourite of mine; men-
tioned also in David Allen’s ‘Get-
ting things done,’ Clear shares
that, in order to start and maintain
any habit – start small. As small
as possible. I’ll use an example.
Say, you’d like to read more. Start
by reading a page. Clear suggest
spending just 2 minutes on that
task of reading a book. After those
2 minutes however, you most
probably will just carry on read-
ing, because you’ve completed the
hard part of the task. You active-
ly picked up the book, sat down,
and actually began to read. You’ve
eliminated the daunting task of
reading a whole book with many,
many words by candidly tricking
your brain into thinking ‘just two
minutes.’ Clear’s reasoning is that
any new habit can be simplified,
and any habit can be shortened to
just 2-minutes: “Read before bed
each night” becomes “Read one
page, “Do thirty minutes of yoga”
becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
So that’s one ground-breaking
way of starting a new habit, but
how do you stick to that habit?
Clear casts a critical lens on
behaviour change and what pos-
sesses someone to excel at a hab-
it. He argues that most habits are
‘outcome-based habits.’ Habits
based solely on results. Clear
interprets behaviour change us-
ing three layers: the outer layer
being the change in outcome,
followed by the change in pro-
cess and then your identity
which rests in the centre. Clear
tackles behaviour change by dis-
mantling the ubiquitous view
that you should solely have set
goals to work towards; instead
suggests that you work towards
who you wish to become. Habits
are ultimately what distinguish
your views, beliefs and personal-
ity from a Bob, Karen or Margret.
Under the aegis of Clear, I put this
to the test.
Recently, I’ve been particular-
ly fond of the remarkable mental
and physical condition of SBS op-
erators. I found their level of fit-
ness to be mesmerising; I wanted
to be like them. I included more
workouts that mirror that of a sol-
dier (push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups,
running), I was consistent, and
with the wish to become anything
as close to a Special Forces Oper-
ator, fitness soon became a a part
of my identity. I focused on the
process more than a desired phy-
sique. My intensity in each ses-
sion grew as I was more eager to
mould myself into this new shiny
identity. I almost tricked my brain
into thinking I was an elite soldier

– pathetic I know. But this can be applied to any-
thing, and often why people are inspired by celebri-
ties and the successful. The message, however, is not
to be yourself. The message is to make a habit apart
of your identity by becoming a reader, a runner, a
writer, a boxer; instead of someone who wants to
read, run and write. That slight adjustment in your
mentality can make all the difference.
The downsides
Now that you’re charged with excitement and over
the moon with starting your new habit, allow me to
drag you, gently, back to reality. Let us now explore
the bitter, buzzkill actualities of developing a habit!
Why are good habits so hard to develop?
As humans, we ‘place a high value on instant grat-
ification.’ Clear mentions ‘the Cardinal Rule of Be-
haviour Change: What is immediately rewarded is
repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided’,
which charmingly, explains why we procrastinate.
One might avoid a workout because of the ‘delayed
return’ associated with a workout. Doing one hun-
dred push-ups isn’t going to result in an improved
physique immediately. Research has shown the
instant gratification associated with social media
