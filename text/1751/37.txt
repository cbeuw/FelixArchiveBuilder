Environmental injustice in the UK
prevents access to nature for all

Spending time in natural environ-
ments and forming connections
with other species is vital for our health
and sustainability. However, in many
urban areas of the world, finding time
and space for these connections is
not accessible for all. Environmental
inequality manifests itself in people’s
access to green space, pollution risk and
exposure to flood risk. According to a
review of past research, ‘environmen-
tal injustice is a real and substantive
problem that afflicts many of our most
deprived and socially excluded groups’,
likewise, a report by the Environment
Agency states that people who are so-
cially and economically disadvantaged
often have less access to green space.
A paper from DEFRA (Department
of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs
in the UK) states that exposure to the
natural environment is significantly
lower in ethnic minorities populations
and low-income populations compared
to the rest of the population. Plus in
2018, Natural England published a
report ‘that 63% of the white British
population visited green spaces weekly,
while just 46% of the BAME British
population visited green spaces at sim-
ilar rates’. Furthermore, a study by the
Forestry Commission highlighted that
one of the factors that prevent ethnic
minority people from having equitable
access to woodlands is that they feel
‘unwelcome and out of place’.
Racism in the outdoors and in envi-
ronmental movements prevents ethnic
minorities from accessing nature. Many
white environmentalist organisations
do not care for inner-city environ-
mental racism nor for ethnic minority
access to the countryside. Moreover, for
environmental justice in the UK, it is
not just important to increase the num-
ber green spaces but also to consult
with local communities and support
community networks
for creating an action
plan for a more sustain-
able city.
Racism is an en-
vironmental issue.
Susan Cutter defines
environmental justice
as ‘Equal access to a
clean environment and
equal protection from
possible environmental
harm irrespective of
race, income, class, or
other differentiating
features of socioeco-
nomic status’. Racism
dictates which communities get worse
pollution, more exposure to harmful
chemicals and proximity to waste-pro-
cessing sites.
It is essential for white people,
including myself, to remember that if
you are not actively anti-racist, you are
maintaining the status quo of white

Marine Bi-
ologist Dr
Ayana John-
son recently
wrote in an
article, ‘To
the white
people who
care about
maintaining
a habitable
planet, I
need you to
be actively
anti-racist.
I need you
to understand that our inequality crisis
is intertwined with the climate crisis. If
we don’t work on both, we will suc-
ceed at neither’. Therefore, any form of
activism, such as climate justice work,
is not fulfilling its purpose if it doesn’t
have anti-oppression and anti-racism at
its core.
Amid the current pandemic, there
are countless tips and articles
online about how to cope and look after
our health (mentally and physically).
Almost all of them include going out-
side, but very few go into the details of
why it’s beneficial.
In ‘The Nature Fix: Why Nature
Makes Us Happier, Healthier, and
More Creative’, Florence Williams goes
into incredible depth about the scientif-
ic benefits of spending time in nature,
whilst covering a wide breadth of topics
to argue that nature is not a luxury, but
rather, a necessity for humans to thrive.
One of the most remarkable features
of this book is the sheer amount of
scientific research and analysis that has
gone into making the arguments for
nature convincing. As someone who
majors in a science degree, it was so
refreshing to see the amount of con-
crete empirical evidence that Williams
provided. For example, when it comes
to concepts such as ‘forest-bathing’ or
‘eco-therapy’, it can become all too easy
for people to dismiss it or deem them
as hippy-related solutions that aren’t
based on factual understand-
ing. That’s why this
book can hopefully
encourage and inspire
not just those who
need a little push to
get outside, but also
for those who are scep-
tical about the benefits
nature can bring us.
Whilst there is a lot
of science inside it, the
book doesn’t feel heavy
on the brain at all. Instead,
Williams somehow man-
ages to seamlessly weave
together facts with per-
sonal sentiments, descrip- tive
narratives, as well as specks of humour.
For example, there are several chapters
dedicated to her experience of spend-
ing time in nature with PTSD and
ADHD patients. Her personal story
of interacting with them and watching
them heal, speaks beyond
factual arguments to a
more profound innate
human desire to get in
touch with nature as
a means of restoring
our well-being. With
the global rise in
mental health issues
such as anxiety and
depression, it’s
clear to see how a
future in which
people better
appreciate na-
ture, could bring
about a gener-
ation of more balanced,
vibrant and engaging individuals.
Another aspect of the book that
made it compelling was how Williams
gathered information and insights from
all over the world to convey the univer-
sal and timeless value of nature. From
studies about forest-bathing in Japan, to
the Scandanavian concept of having free
access forests, by touching upon the dif-
ferent values that communities around
the world place on nature, it’s clear to
see how nature is necessary for fostering
a planet of happy, healthy people.
As we all spend an increasing amount
of time indoors, due to both the global
pandemic and our lifestyles being dom-
inated by screens, it’s even more vital for
us to take time outside. The good part
is, as Williams reassures us in the book,
it doesn’t mean we need to spend an
entire week in the middle of nowhere
(although that would be great too);
even just little doses of nature whenev-
er we can, is undoubtedly better than
nothing.
