POLITICAL SCIENCE
Consider the objects that an artist
and a scientist creates.
An artist produces objects
which are very personal to her, but
are taken on by the universe as
very personal to them. An artist will
not sell objects which are too
personal to her. Kubrick may ban
The Clockwork Orange in Britain,
but the general impression is that
an artist's responsibility for her
work ends as soon as the work is
taken on by the public.
But consider the scientist.
He produces theories for the
universe. His theories have no
personal appeal to himself: they
are of an immense generality, of
use to everyone. But contrary to
the spirit in which the theory is
produced, the universe (ie,
everybody else) does not take on
the theory as though it were part of
them. Theories are tools,
extensions to our thoughts, but
something cold, something alien.
We are impressed by the simplicity
of a theory, but perhaps not in the
same way as we are awed by a
magnificent piece of art.
There is the other difference
(in the objects produced) that a
scientist is rarely in the position
where he will say "
I won't publish
this theory because it means
something to me". In fact, the
scientist usually has the opposite
approach. Recall Einstein writing to
Roosevelt at the time of the Second
World War, saying that if America
did not produce the A-bomb then
the Germans would. "If I don't
publish this theory then somebody
else will." Is it because a scientist
produces objects of such universal
generality that he feels less
responsibility for its behaviour?

Saddam's latest bout of
adventurism in the Gulf again
forces on others the question of
how to prevent him from keeping
the region churned up and
insecure indefinitely. Once again
he has created a military crisis and
been forced back by American
might and muscle. And yes, once
again he could end up with a deal
that allows him to remain in total
control at home, grow in prestige
abroad as a leader of Islam and
rebuild for a new bullying session
against his neighbours.
"Saddam is an
unconventional
miscreant..."
Of the latest solutions in
keeping Saddam Hussein at bay,
and one that seems to be
gathering considerable support, is
to restrict the forces he can deploy
in southern Iraq. Another would be
to demonstrate to the Iraqi people
that he cannot protect the
sovereignty and integrity of the
Iraqi nation. This is a good idea,
but there seem to be signs of
slippage amongst the allies, with
the French and the Russians not in
agreement with the U.S. and
Britain on how this should be
implemented. No matter, any
restriction on the mobility of
Saddam's troops is likely to reduce
his trouble making ability.
The Iraqi leader complains
that the UN is treating him
unfairly. No sooner does he claim
to meet a UN demand, than
another is put before him. He is
right to say that more is demanded
of him than conventional
miscreants.
"Iraq does not
deserve a
break..."
There is a good reason: he is
an unconventional miscreant, more
duplicitous, more dangerous, more
tenacious and some would say,
more insane. Saddam's Iraq does
not deserve a break from others;
others deserve protection from
Saddam's Iraq. Can they gain
sufficient protection while he
remains in Baghdad is the
question?
Sanctions remain in place, as
they should. They pressurize
Saddam Hussein to respect UN
resolutions. His pressure on his
people shows their effect. The Iraqi
people are suffering from the
sanctions, but much of that is
because he denies what relief they
could get if he took up the long
available option to sell oil under
international supervision for
humanitarian supplies. The UN is
right to hold sanctions.

Frater Fiam writes
I found myself in
the unusual
position last
week of having
to direct some
aquaintances to
a location not
more than five
minutes from
their very own
college - a place
that they had
inhabited for a
full two dozen
months and yet more. Your Frater,
as you may imagine, was disturbed
by this. He questioned how they
can live, if they have no knowledge
of the area they are living in. Have
they no desire for exploration?
Everyone within academia
should be an explorer. They have
opted to devote three years or
more exploring the niceties of a
subject which should be close to
their hearts. Yet the will to explore
is strangely lacking in many - they
remain like those derided souls
tether'd in Plato's cave, destined to
see only a cinematic projection of
the tomfoolery of those who mock
them. Your Frater would like to ask
his readers if they are similarly
mocked.
Everybody should exert
themselves with exploration, both
internally and
externally. I
t is an
impossible to
explore all, but
certain fruitful
areas remain surp-
risingly unsought.
One such realm is
that of the Self,
that place of dark
and unbound
desires, that
miasma of trivia
and unforgotten
pasts. The few who successfully
undertake the task of self
knowledge gain notoriety, such is
the difficulty of their task. Sages,
seers, mystics all walk this path,
and some go far. Some few may
even reach the destination, that of
total awareness; but in doing so
they inevitably are no longer
human. Your Frater has only
touched the surface of this realm,
and yet there is sufficient within for
him to mark each new discovery
with permanence. Two such marks
are now borne by he.
So I shall instruct you this
week to reach deep, deep into
your minds so as to truly know
what is there, yea to truly know
what is there.I must depart anon,
as Gabriel awaits.
