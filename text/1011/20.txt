Okay, let's get one thing straight.
The Alarm were a great band (a
statement which should exterminate
any street cred I possess). And after
seeing ex-frontman Mike Peters at
the LA2, you can be sure that he's
now at the helm of another great
band.
So what's great? Try honesty,
commitment, passion and, of
course, those songs - Dylan, the
Stones and the Clash welded into
heartfelt anthems. Ably backed by
his band, the Poets, Mike treated
his army of dedicated followers to
an unceasing torrent of gems from
his debut solo album, Breathe, as
well as an ample selection of past
classics. Perhaps it was telling that
it took 'Where were you hiding
when the storm broke', from 1984's
'Declaration', to really ignite the
crowd but from then on everything
was ecstatically lapped up. Gentle,
haunting songs like 'Levis & Bibles',
punchy, angry sounds of intent like
'Back into the System' and even an
acoustic medley combined to fill
our hearts with joy. I could spout
superlatives for a whole page but
then I don't have that much space.
So, let's just say that if live
playing is still seen as a true test of
whether a rock band can really cut
it, and if honesty is still held as a
virtue, then Mike Peters deserves
your attention - now.
Queensryche have often been
described as the thinking person's
heavy metal band. If you're not
convinced or just don't know, then
one spin of their fifth album,
Promised Land, should do the trick.
Not that you'll like it after one spin.
No, because thinking person's
music means complex arrangements,
strange time signatures, seemingly
odd instrument mixes and most of
all, the need for patience. Thank
goodness that patience decided to
pay me a surprise visit for this
album because it's worth taking the
time over.
There aren't many bands who
can plunge you headlong from the
sound of a baby being born
('9.28am') into an Eastern-
flavoured, Zeppelin-style rock piece
('I am I') and leave you wanting
more. There aren't many bands
who with one hand can paint
paranoid soundscapes around a
menacing, rolling guitar riff
('Damaged') and then with the
other hand guide you gently
through the pain of not having a
proper father-to-son relationship in
an emotive, acoustic setting
('Bridge'). And there certainly aren't
many bands who can mix heavy
guitar, background spoken word

sections and rhythmic, saxophones
into an eight minute title track and
prevent it from turning out a
disasterl So, if you're a thinking
person and you don't like heavy
metal...you work it out. (7)
After several false starts,
Terrorvision finally sauntered onto
stage and launched into an altered
version of 'Alice what's the
matter?', the current single. Their
guitarist managed to create a much
more roomy and capable sound
than both the support bands had
previously done. In songs like 'My

House' and the inspired 'Pretend
Best Friend' he really shone
through. Terrorvision's songs are
well written, memorable and with
their obvious talent it's easy to see
why they have earned so much
praise from a usually apathetic
music press.
Their usual laid back approach
and ability not to take themselves
too seriously was marred by the
appearance in 'Middleman' of a
ten piece string section in evening
dress, complete with conductor.
This was a little o.t.t. and pompous,
and it would be shame if
Terrorvision followed so many
bands into self-indulgence. Apart
from that however, it was a
seriously good gig from Bradford's
finest. Roll on the next album.
The new Front 242 album,
Live, is less techno and more back
to the original industrial roots of
the band. The authentic power tool
sounds that are synonymous with
live industrial music are all here,
though whether these are being
played live or come off a tape is
debatable. (Few venues will allow
such performances these days after
hearing horror stories about the
stages collapsing after being cut to
pieces by over enthusiastic power
saw wielding industrial bands.)
This cd is a very good
proposition for existing 242 fans.
With dates cancelled in the last UK
tour this could be the only chance
that some of them will get to hear
the band live. If you're not familiar
with Front 242, or industrial music,
then I wouldn't recommend this
release; go out and buy one of the
mainstream albums and lose
yourself in the gorgeous multi-
layered noise that Front 242 have
perfected over the last decade, then
think about buying this. (7) Q
Bar Rumba (36 Shaftesbury Av) is
one of the better club venues in
town. Situated just next door to
the Trocadero, late night travel
and munchies are easily found.
After a minimal £3 entrance fee
beers are £2.40 and shorts range
from £2 upwards.
In the past it was a favourite
night out for me, but this time
perhaps my expectations spoiled
the club. Don't believe the flyer's
description of Funk-the-music.
Here is Trip hop and I hated it.
(Trip hop is a fusion of just about
everything; house, funk and hip
hop, and nobody dances.)
However having live jam
sessions in between the DJ's sets
was an inspired decision by the
promoter and her inspiration
didn't leave her when she chose
Ike Leo to head up the music that
evening. Sadly the Bar Rumba
crowd has changed and even Ike's
excellent double base plucking
didn't have people moving. But all
this is just opinion. The place is
rammed wall to wall every
Monday, so it can't be just the DJs
that like standing still to music.
There is nothing better than
live, improvised funk for moving
the soul as well as the feet. So for
all those who need therapy, here's
Ike's guide to live clubbing:
Iceni (White Horse St) on
Wednesday and Saturday.
WKD (18 Kentish Town Rd)
on Friday and Sunday. This is one
of my all time favourites - music is
rarely better!
Earth Club (International
Students House, 229 Gt Portland
St) for a Thursday night cheapie
(£3).
There are also rumours of
somewhere called the A r e n a
Club but we haven't found it yet.0
