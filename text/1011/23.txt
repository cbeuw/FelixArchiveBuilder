IC continued their winning
league run with a demolition
of LSE. As normal we were
winning at half time but,
instead of becoming defensive
in the second half, we moved
up a gear and scored almost at
will.
Although it was a day for
attackers to grab the glory,
some solid defending by
Matteo Yarina and a couple of
excellent saves by Chris
Evdemon laid the foundation
for the passing football which
LSE could not withstand.
After three wins out of
three, hopes are high that this
could be our season.

IC lstvs LSE lst
The first team faced their
toughest match of the season
when they played LSE.
Undefeated so far this year in
both the London University
and BUSA leagues, we were
out to avenge our loss from
last season. Thefirsttwo
matches were extremely close
but we conceded defeat in
both of them. Sonaar Shan
and Tony Nolan soon set the
record straight, winning their
matches to even the score.
Everything now rested on the
final match, and LSE had
wheeled out their "Ace" - a
Brazilian international player.
After losing the first game,
Adam Waddington played his
best match of the season to
finally win.

IC Ladies vs LSE
If we had a full team, the score
would have been a storming
9 - 0. Unfortunately we were a
pair down, but the team
rallied to give a decisive
victory, with everyone
winning all their games
without too many problems
(despite Penny & Elaine's
many giggling fits). This now
leaves us at the top of the
league table. Yippee!

After a mystery tour coach
journey, IC came out foaming
at the mouth for this UAU
encounter with LSE.
[('. controlled the game
from the kick-off and ran in
two impressive tries from
halfway by Mark Wishart and
came back into the match
scoring a lucky try before half
time.
Following sharp words by
Tim Townend in his half time
talk, IC still started the second
half in lethargic manner
before reasserting the
domination. This led to two
tries by Richard Stubbs
following some scintillating
back play.
The forwards clipped in
with a try by Martin Ayre after
a succession of close interplay
within the pack. Jim Ryan
went off with a nasty head
injury, but this didn't stop IC
scoring a 60 metre try by Mike
Dwyer, with Aled Bowen
converting.

A storming performance by IC
saw them cruise to victory
over LSE.
IC opened their account
with a penalty followed by a
well worked try by Kimble
Virdi. Andy Cooke scored a
push-over try and Nick
Morguns danced under the
posts for another score which
was converted.
IC started the second half
in similar fashion and
following a quick tap penalty
and sharp handling in the
backs, Tunji Lodsja streaked
down the wing to score a fine
- try.
Jamil kept his try-a-match
streak going with a 30 metre
dash and Nick grabbed his
second with a rocket-man dive
over the line. A fine
performance was capped off by
Gareth Williams who
intercepted a pass and with
hot pursuit, sped the length of
the field to score.

ICvs St. George 2nd
IC made a strong start to this
season's cup campaign despite
the mysterious absence of Lisa
Strittmater. Unperturbed, IC
immediately took the lead and
at the end of the lst half St.
Georges,had yet to score.
Aided by;^xtremely:ftcctirate
shooting ft made good use ol
the opportunity to practice
their passing, in spite of the
fact that several players were
playing out of their normal
positions. The score broke
through the half century
barrier at the beginning of the
3rd quarter. In the name of
good sportsman: hip e
decided to let them score in
the last quarter.
The final result was a
resounding victory for IC and
provided food for thought
about different team
combinations.

Editorial
After having had to seriously
shorten all the reports for the
last 2 issues in order to get
them all in, we are now
finding ourselves in the
opposite situation: an
•!
- odance of white space.
We're taking this
•pportun ity to apologise to the
Hockey Men (3rd team). Last
• • -• they deserved a 0 , not
the [xj they recieved. We also
apologise to the Hockey
Ladies (lst and 2nd team) for
having put their scores the
•' i .'ay around in the table.
Si; @ for us!
I hope these mistakes are
not the reason why we didn't
get many results this week.
Much as we like waffling
on about how stupid we are,
we much prefer to fill the page
with match reports. If this
trend of white space continues,
the Sport page will have an
uncertain future.
On a more cheery note,
thanks to all those who did
give us reports.

Second race in the London Colleges' League (at Guildford)
The horrid conditions did not prevent an outstanding
performance by the IC teams, especially the women (the 'A'
team came first and the 'B' team second). There was also an
encouraging improvement in the placing of the men
[Apparently still not good enough to let us know their position -
Ed].
