addressed the panel. The three
professionals underestimated the
intelligence and knowledge of the
panel and they were punished for
it in the panel's report. It was
good to see that on the second day
both the environmentalists and
the industrialists softened and
tried to persuade the panel using
reasoned arguments.
The consensus from experts
"in the ethics business" was that
plant biotechnology was not a
new moral departure, just a mat-
ter of degree; all agriculture is
about transforming 'nature', all
innovations lead to upheavals in
society. Andrew Bond of the
Vegetarian Society initiated a
debate on whether animal genes
are vegetarian or not.
Many of the panel members
exhibited a strong concern for
justice in dealings with the third
world, as the report makes clear.
"The International Community is
called upon to balance the legiti-
mate concerns of research com-
munities who invest in [biotech-
nology] and the vast numbers of
peasant farmers who maintain
and protect the many local vari-
eties of crops that are essential for
the preservation of biodiversity."

between making a profit and ben-
efiting society. Towards the end
of the conference the lay panel
was asked whether there's a polit-
ical will for useful, as opposed to
profitable, research. Among their
replies were a flat "No", "I hope
against hope" and "Most of the
work being done in the developed
world is cosmetic. If you want to
do really useful work you must go
to the developing world."
Politicians were rightly
absent from the conference except
for William Waldegrave's substi-
tute, Anne Campbell MP (Lab)
and Lord Howie of Troon. (The
latter is the Chairman of the
House of Lords' Select
Committee on Science and
Technology enquiry into
"Regulation of the U K
Biotechnology Industry and
Global Competitiveness".) They
gave their views on the lay panel's
report. The politicians' attitude
was depressingly predictable:
they stressed communicating to
and educating the public, rather
than consultation and dialogue.
Lord Howie gave us a typi-
cal politician's speech. He kicked
off by insulting the panel, claim-
ing the conference process will
have little "ultimate value"

because it consisted of
only two days' consulta-
tion and a report writ-
ten overnight. In saying
this he neglected the
months of work the lay
panel put in before the
conference started.
Next, he professed
broad agreement with
the lay panel's report
and then detailed his
dissent from all their
main conclusions. The
report expressed a
strong desire for more
control and informa-
tion. At present, once
the government has
approved "deliberate
release" of genetically
altered plants, a compa-
ny has no obligation to
monitor the effects of
the release. The panel recom-
mended obligatory post-release
monitoring. Lord Howie called
this "a fourth hurdle that is not
right." Fourteen of the panelists
said they would eat food pro-
duced from genetically trans-
formed plants. They also called
for "clear meaningful labelling"
of all products that have been
genetically engineered, so that
"the public can ... freely exercise
its right to choose." Lord Howie
disagreed with this too, saying
that consumers would equate
labelling with danger, as on ciga-
rette packets. In so doing he
showed his disdain for the public.
Are politicians more qualified to
make decisions about complex
issues like plant biotechnology?
They probably know a lot less
than the lay panel now do.
Unfortunately we cannot ignore
Lord Howie's decisions, nor will
we ever have the opportunity to
vote him out of the Lords.
The panel strove for inde-
pendence when writing their
report. The opening statement
said "We set the agenda of discus-
sion, requested the relevant avail-
able experts as we understood
them to be, evaluated their evi-
dence to the best of our ability,
and wrote the report with com-
plete independence."
Given 16 panelists, the bal-
anced tone of the report was
inevitable. It perhaps summarises
the evidence given to the panel
without giving a coherent set of

recommendations. This was
unsurprising given the extremely
short time the panel had to com-
pile the report. They adjourned to
write it at 3.30 on Thursday after-
noon and presented the complet-
ed version at 10 the following
morning. In my view this deval-
ued the rest of the conference.
The report contained too many
ambiguous statements and incon-
sistencies.
Will consensus conferences
become "a new way of making
decisions in the U K " , as Anne
Campbell M P hoped? In this
country we have become far too
dependent on an adversarial sys-
tem of validating facts and mak-
ing decisions. To move away from
such systems, we must support
working alternatives that allow a
wide range of people to feel that
they've been consulted, or at least,
that their interests have been
taken into account. That way we
can all feel we have invested part
of ourselves in our society. The
conference has already partly suc-
ceeded by bringing together all
the interested parties, and forcing
them to debate intelligently.
More success depends upon those
in power making use of the report
from this consensus conference
and commissioning more confer-
ences.
