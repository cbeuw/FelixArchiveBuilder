Purely for the sake of consistency psedonomy defeats the banal... Edited this week by Glyph
Hacky
Ramblings
Dear Owain,
I have been actively involved
with Sports Clubs over the last two
years and have a knowledge of
most of them. The advert you
carried for Wing Chun Kung Fu in
Felix issue 1010 rather amused me.
I find it hard to believe that the
Club manages charity work within
the Union gym and would
appreciate any information about
such activities.
The advert also mentions the
Mayors of London, Westminster
and Haringey, when did these
demonstrations take place?
"Many Celebrities and VIPs have
walked the grounds of IC", yes, but
how many have been interested in
Wing Chun? Sifu Sofos has been
awarded "progress with humanity",
so? What the hell is "progress with
humanity"?
Wing Chun claim to have raised
money for charities (do RAG know
about this?) exactly how much
money has been raised, and which
charities? Is the parent academy
for Wing Chun the charity?
How does the Club manage to
council students for exam work and
emotional stresses? Surely this is a
matter for the professionals in the
Union and College. Wing Chun
claim to be the "winning team".
What competitions have they
entered? Are the results
acknowledged by UAU and the
Union?
Surely a Club talking about
giving students "spiritual
enlightenment" should be a
religious Society and hence in
SCC?
Everyone should wise up to
adverts and read them for what
they actually are. Self
congratulating drivel without
foundation should be ignoredl
Students of Imperial College
you have been warned.
Name witheld by request
Well, if your inferiority complex is
such that you require new and
interesting ways in which to kick the
desiccated coconut out of people,
the adverts you write are not going
to draw attention to the fact that
you are a psychotic. "Join the Royal
Marines, we have a fabulous dental
plan"etc. Still, why do you care?
This reeks of internal hacky-politics
to me. Slide back under your rock
whydoncha Mr Request.
Out ofthe
Closet and
Under the
Tofu
Dear Felix,
In response to Samin's comment
that "To Glyph, gay is trendy",
whether Glyph or Samin himself
actually believe this; being gay
isn't trendy.
As an out lesbian at Imperial
College I find that the atmosphere
on campus is incredibly
homophobic. This isn't helped by
statements saying that people are
only gay because it's fashionable.
When people start to realise that
homosexuality isn't something you
can change like you can change
your shoes, then perhaps we will
move a step closer to equality at
I.C.
Yours sincerely

You must understand that I was
having a go at the politically correct
view that we should all consort with
homosexuals, love our neighbours
and breast feed Somali babies. It
may have been less than polite to
site the two prominent homosexuals
in the college, but after all, how can
you be flippant without looking into
the face of Imperial College; and
you are in the face of Imperial
College. At the same time you must
get people coming up to you saying
"Oh you're so brave dahling, those
bastards, those bastards I Do come
round for a tofu sandwich
sometime." I think for the new
bourgoise it's trendy to like gay
people, and I have never said
anything else. If Samin watsisname
or yourself want to take me out of
context, then there it is, but I'm
confident that I stand with an egg-
free face.
Pink for Girls
Dear Anna
I was surprised and pleased to
find your letter in Felix. But I think
you would be surprised about how
few people have noticed the
questionnaire - I know because I
was walking around asking people
and most had not even heard of it!
This was also well demonstrated
during the last UGM of the summer
term, when a spontaneous motion
demanded that the results should
not be allowed to be published
because the questions were
leading. When it was asked how
many people knew the
questionnaire, only a handful of
people did. Unfortunately they
decided I am not to publish any of
the findings. This is a real pity: the
reaction was very diverse, and
gives quite a bit of insight into
many aspects of the life of female
students. And it would have been a
lot better to let individuals decide
for themselves after reading about
the results, rather than to force the
opinion of a few on the rest of the
college.
I know now that the
questionnaire could have been set
up in a different way. When I
published it I honestly believed that
the contents would not offend
anybody, as I had asked many
friends (male and female) whether
they could find anything 'sensitive'
and I consider aggressive
arguments counterproductive.
I had also hoped that some
chaps would come forward with
what they thought, but sadly there
has not been any response of that
kind at all; it seems I was too
subtlel However, I have asked
many of my male friends whether
they have ever been harassed, and
if anything they said that they have
experienced something like 'a
minor nuisance' (to use your
words). A few went far enough to
say that they have felt threatened
by male attention, in contrast to
female attention. And some of
them were worried on the streets at
night, but because of potential
male rapist rather than some scary
females.
The survey was intended to
sample opinions and to trigger a
discussion about the subject (which
finally might come about, thanks to
you, Anna). Some women greatly
welcomed the interest in their
situation. Some people seemed to
believe that I was eager to get as
many complaints as possible. And,
given the feeling that the questions
were 'leading', some of them have
little confidence in their colleagues
if they believe that they can be
manipulated so easily! (
I am aware
that there have been cases where
suggestive hypnosis resulted in
made-up abuse memories etc - but
this would be grossly
overestimating the influence I could
have even if I wanted!) I would be
happiest if there were no
complaints at all, and the post of
Women's Officer was completely
uncalled for. This is not yet the case
(although the situation is not too
bleak either!)..
A few women demanded that I
apologise to the whole male
population of Imperial, which I am
absolutely willing to do (including
to those that told me it was alright):
I apologise - no offense intended.
The women who come to
Imperial must know that there is a
strong male majority, and the fact
that they come here after all
indicates that they feel reasonably
relaxed about this. In fact, I do not
know of any females here who
'view contact with men with
extreme prejudice'. I assume many
of them indulge in male company
as much as I do.
The problem with something
like harassment is that it is very
subjective. Some women do not
mind jokes that others consider to
be insulting. You might not mind
being called a rhinoceros by your
neighbours but if you do you can
take them to court. So why should
one be less upset about remarks
that aim at your gender? Why is it
that complaints in this directionare
so often considered to be petty and
sad?
I agree that many harassers are
not aware of the agony they are
causing, and certainly counselling
is a far more useful tool to deal
with such cases than punishments.
However just telling the harasser to
stop is not always effective.
Certainly you are right in saying
that it is shy and insecure people
who get most molested, whether
male or female, and who
consequently find it hard to
confront their harassers. However, I
am certain that many 'normally
confident' women also sometimes
find it difficult to make it clear that
they feel uncomfortable about a
situation. After all, one does not
want to seem
petty/impolite/tactless/horrible etc.
In fact, it happens that women
worry whether they might be
overreacting and hysterical.
Sobetter shut up and endure
whatever?
I do not consider it a good idea
to treat women with velvet gloves.
Otherwise they might enter a job
and suddenly find themselves in a
world they cannot deal with.
Instead, it is important to make
sure that women are self-assertive
enough to deal with the problems
they might encounter. For this it
can help to know that there are
people who take your problems
seriously, and that you feel
