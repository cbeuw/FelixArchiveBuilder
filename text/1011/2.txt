Eloquent Science
Sam Michel, Imperial College Union's (ICU) Events Manager, will be
leaving his post in three weeks time, writes Andy Sinharay. Sam, who has
been working at the Union for one and a halfyears, is due to take up a new
post at the offices of Time Out on Tottenham Court Road, where he will be
setting up a "web server'for their computer network.
Although his primary responsibility was Union Events, he has been
involved in the setting up of a similar system for ICU. "I do a lot of
Information [Technology] stuff," he said. Sam has been involved in all
manner of activities rangingfromrunning the Careers Fair to organising
stewarding, balls and room hire. Being a graduate of computer systems
engineering, he wanted to go into multimedia and felt that the Time Out job
offered him the best opportunity.
Leaving ICU may not be easy: "It's been really cool here, it's a really
good team...I'm very sad to leave this place, and particularly the people."

The Imperial College press office
has just produced a leaflet
entitled 'Speaking to the Media'.
With academics increasingly
appearing in the public eye, Ms
Lynda Davies, Director of
Marketing, said that many
people were nervous about
talking to the media.
The document is designed
to give advice on how best to talk
to journalists and T V
interviewers. "We've had
requests over the last year from
people, mainly medics, on
whether there were any guide-
lines, but this was something we
were going to do anyway," she
said. Copies have been
distributed around College and
already the Press Office has
received requests for more. "The
days are gone of the PR officer
talking [to the press]", she said,
"now it's everyone's respon-
sibility to talk to the media."
Saying that the booklet was
long overdue, Ms Michelle Duffy
of the College press office said
that in the past staff have asked
what to wear to interviews and
how to act. The leaflet supp-
lements existing training courses
at Imperial in which academics
are subjected to mock T V
interviews. Descended from
publications produced by Frank
Albrighton, Director Of Public
Affairs at Birmingham Uni-
versity, the booklet also contains
information on handling
sensitive issues and talking about
research.
Ms Duffy, however will not
be at Imperial to see the fruit of
her efforts. She is leaving her
post as Press Officer and will be
returning to her native New
Zealand on Saturday. Although
she has worked at Imperial for
the last three years, she said, "I
wasn't intending to stay...but the
longer you stay here the harder it
is to leave. I'm like all New
Zealanders." Living in Roe-
hampton she was happy to accept
the offer of a post at Imperial as
assistant press officer. "I'd heard
it was the best [college] in
London", she said. F E L I X
wishes Michelle all the best
Down Under and awaits an
eloquent and nerve-free postcard
from her homeland.
Student Loans For Sale
BY ANDREW TSENG
NEWS EDITOR
A student furore has erupted
after a confidential Department
for Education document was
leaked to The Guardian this
week.
The document details plans
for the privatisation of the
Student Loans Company. The
state-owned company manages
loans to students for the which
only interest charged is in line
with inflation. Two options are
suggested. The first proposes
that the Treasury subsidises
private banks and credit
companies to the order of
hundreds of millions of pounds
to continue the no-interest
system. Under the second
proposal, loans would be paid
back at commercial rates, though
there would be interest free
periods whilst studying and the
repayment of loans would be
deferred.
The Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principles
(CVCP) has consistently opposed
the Student Loans Company.
Speaking to FELIX, spokesman
Dr Ted Nield said, "We
disapprove of the Student Loans
Company fundamentally. That's
mainly because of the repayment
scheme. We don't see any
difference between a Student
Loan Company which is publicly
owned or one that is privately
owned. If the Government had
got the repayment scheme right
in the first place, the banks
would have taken it."
The CVCP favour a
mechanism whereby students do
not have to repay the loan in a
fixed period. "You repay a fixed
percentage of your income once
graduated. The term of the loan
varies until the loan is repaid."
Lucy Chothia, President of
Imperial College Union,
condemned the plans: "It's
completely appalling. We have
huge numbers of students who
are up to their neck in debt. The
Government just seems to be set
on ruining students and forcing
people from less well off families
out of higher education."
At a college welfare meeting
held earlier this week, College
appeared to have resigned itself
to Government policy. A n
attendee commented, "It's
extremely frustrating to see the
apathy amongst college welfare
staff when this means so much to
the students."
Horse

Research being undertaken at
Imperial will determine the
future of equestrian events at the
next Olympics.
In a joint venture with the
Animal Health Trust, Dr Robert
Schroter of the Bagrit Centre,
has been studying the effects of
the punishing Atlanta environ-
ment on the horses' welfare.
Based on the research, the FEI,
the international body which
governs equestrian events, has
submitted a report to the
International Olympic Comm-
ittee with guidelines for 1996's 3-
day event.
Concern mounted after the
last Olympics in Barcelona,
