Net Special II - College WWW Page Review
MORE THAN JUST A SCIENCE PAGE
COLLEGE WWW SERVER SURVEY
IMPROVING YOUR RZEPUTATION
Another great team effort this week in the S-Ft7es! So
far we've covered the opinions of "Internet Access
(1007), undergraduate ^womenOOOS), ^Science
Communication(1009) and URVirtual Reality(lOlO). In coming
weeks, we're going to be looking at &Hard and ®Soft Science with
Robert May, famous J>Muso/Scientists, the 3^Big Bang
debate.Science ^Ideology, SQuasi-Science versus ft^OTheology,
and following up on our '"'Women UG page with a look at the
Staff/PG perspective. And that's just the first term! So, far, we've
also sent ten people to the Future Entertainment Show at Earl's
Court and twelve to the Emaginator Ride in Piccadilly! Not bad,
huh? This week, we return for a last look at the net with a review
of the College's virtual net presence via the World Wide Web.
College £• World W
i
d
e llleb pages vary wildly in quality
and content. The main College £ • homepage
(http://www.ic.ac.uk) contains links into various
services, most of which contain little or no meat.
Some work is needed here to liven up a very dull
page! Clicking on the "Acade-mic Departments"
CQhypertext links into (yup!) a list of IC departments
and research centres. Only some of these entries
link into departmental £0 homepages and none to
research centres. (Some £• homepages were under con-
struction). Aero had the best pics, but not much
content. Computer Science had loads of content (as
expected) although looked a little dull; it
was good to see coursework notes appear-
ing in hypertext form and the pictorial
walk around College is fun! Physics is also excellent,
with research groups offering a great depth of excel-
lent content and (gasp!) student society CQhomepages.
The Chemistry CQ h

e was by far the best of all,
offering loads of info accessible in a very elegant and
consistent way and feeling well-used. Pity there's no
ICU, F E L I X , or Student Society homepages
though. In summary - IC CQhomepages should look
great and be useful and used. Most don't. Yet.

The EQhomepage which
belongs to Imperial's
Chemistry Depart-
ment received a boost
to its fame this year when it was
featured in the Internet guide-
book "Teach Your-
self the Internet in 21
days". But it could
hardly ask for a
more effective pro-
moter than its
B3 webmaster, Dr
Henry Rzepa.
"It's what sci-
entific cooperation
is all about", says Dr Rzepa,
whose enthusiasm for all things
Netlike even extends as far as
posting family photographs in a
distant corner of the page. He
can't understand why some
departments are dragging their
feet in allowing undergraduate
access to the Net. "We trust
them in the lab littered with
potential hazards so why should-
n't we trust them with computer
access?" he says, pointing out
that chemistry
, undergrads have
been actively
encouraged to
use email for six
or seven years.
After a title
screen with lots
of welcoming
pictures, the
page offers a wealth of C3hypertext
links to what Dr Rzepa terms
"the world's best teaching mate-
rials in chemistry" from various
international sources. Dr. Rzepa
has managed to demonstrate an
entire third year course graphi-

This week the S-Files together with ICU Bookstore are offering a copy of
"The Internet Golden Directory", worth over £20! It goes to the person w

cally on a series of linked pages,
although he stresses that online
materials are intended to enrich
rather than replace one-to-one
interaction between students and
staff: "All the documentation,
test papers, past exam papers, lab
allocation, and we're actually
encouraging people to submit the
project resulting from the course
in this form. So the third years
will have a chance to show the
world what they've done."
Dr. Rzepa has also placed all
of his research papers and lides
on the GOseruer. "I tend to give
research presentations in this
form, directly from Web pages."
Last week alone, a staggering
20,000 accesses were made to this
EQseruer, including 6531 from the
continent, 3727 by US education
sources, 1585 by companies, and
2050 by U K educational estab-
lishments other than Imperial.
