Union
Training
Over the summer the incoming Union
Officers went on a training weekend at
Silwood. The
weekend was though very useful by
those who were able to attend and it was
agreed that it would be useful to extend the
Union training.
This point was put to College. As a
result of which K i m Everitt (Training and
Development Manager) has agreed to fund
two one day courses for the Union Officers
who have regular meetings with College.
The first of these took place on the
22nd October. Those who attended agreed
that the course was very useful and suggested
that next year it be expanded to include all
members of MSC and CCU executives.
Louise, the Union Finance Manager,
also organised finance training for all those
who can authorise expenditure over Â£100.
This took place on the lst October.
Welfare Week
I am also organising, with those officers of
the Union involved in welfare of various
types, a Welfare Week. This will involve a
number of stalls both in Sherfield and the
Union building and evening events. If
anyone is interested in helping to organise
this week please get in touch with me.
Personnel
Finally Sam, our Events and Marketing
manager will be leaving the Union at the end
of November. His post has been advertised in
both the national and SUSOC newspapers
and interviews for the posts will occur soon.

Imperial College Union Notes:
1
. There are around 7300 students in I.C. U.
2. Not nil students want to attend events organised by the
entertainments committee.
3. At all events, the Entertainments Committee charges for access to
"Beit Quadrangle", "Da Vinci's Bar" and "The Union Bar".
Imperial College Union believes:
1
. Students wishing to use "Beit Quadrangle", "Da Vinci's Bar" and
"The Union Bar" should not be charged if tbey do not wish to attend these
events.
2. Students wanting to see the events organised should pay
entrance fees.
Imperial College Union resolves:
1
. Not to charge students an entrance fee for use of "Beit
Quadrangle", "Do Vinci's Bar" and "The Union Bar".
2. To continue to charge entrance fees at the events organised by
the entertainments Committee in their respective venues.
Imperial College Union Instructs:
1
. The Entertainments Committee to charge entrance fees to the
events which tbey organise at the entrance to their respective venues alone,
leaving "Beit Quadrangle", "Do Vinci's Bar" and "The Union Bar" open for
the benefit of all I.C.U. members when these venues have not been booked.
