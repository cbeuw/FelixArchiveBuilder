supported. I definitely agree that
women should not view themselves
as helpless victims (if they can help
it), but that they should be aware
of their own strength and how they
can tackle adversities.
If there are things that can be
improved, then they should.
Policies which ensure that
everybody is treated with due
respect have nothing to do with
'special treatment'.
The problem is, as so often, one
of communication. Instead of
helping this, it seems I have
managed to cause further
confusion!

This is just more bloody moaning
and navel contemplation. The
semantics of the word harrassment
are such that to question
aggressively and frankly is the only
means of getting any sort of
reasonable data from a
questionnaire. I think on that you
have a point, but at the end of the
day, if anyone is undergoing serious
sexual harrassment at Imperial
College, someone will notice.
Pretending to do something for the
good of women and playing social
worker is not really conducive to
anything constructive. True you may
draw attention to the plight of those
women undergoing sexual
harrassment, but surely you are
deluding yourself. Sexual
harassment is a daily feature in our
lives: you have to deal with it. If
anyone viewed this a serious
problem, then they wouldn't put
you in charge of dealing with it.
Don't take that the wrong way now,
but just because you have two X
chromosomes, that doesn't make
you a gynaecologist.
Some dishy little numbers this
week folks, and thank you for
taking the time to write in. No
apologies to anyone that thinks me
incapable of dealing with womens'
issues, and no apologies to anyone
that feels their PC has been
violated. Did any of you music
lovers notice Martyn with a Y call
My Bloody Valentine a British band?
Come on, I know the Docker's Fist
spouts religiously about the pros of
apathy, but you don't want to listen
to a word from that fella says....
