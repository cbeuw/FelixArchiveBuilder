The Society for European Youth
Euro-skeptic or Euro-phile, you should read this: The EuroSoc is back!
Good news. The renewed and renamed
European Society is up and running; it took
us a lot of effort to first re-establish the soci-
ety within the Union framework and then to
widen its scope and enhance its merits by
bringing new ideas in and continuing to sup-
port previous activities. We are now ready to
present to the rest of the student body our
lines of interest and activities for this term.
In last week's FELIX we had an article
published about the second "Europe 2020"
conference, which will take place in the
University of Oxford from March 18th to
March 24th 1995.
The structure of the conference is as
follows : it starts with a welcoming team-
building program on Sunday; and the follow-
ing two days are spent on committee work.
The first day theme will be "Europe and the
Citizen", whereas the second day discussion
comes under the "Europe beyond its bor-
ders" heading. Two major committees will
deal with the above subjects, each divided
into 9 subcommittees, each of them having
one specific aspect of each subject to debate
upon. High calibre speakers, such as Paddy
Ashdown, Willy Claes (NATO Gen.Sec),
Sir Edward Heath, Michael Heseltine, etc.
have been invited to address the participants
on both the subjects. At the end each com-
mittee produces a white paper, its opinion on
the problem called to discuss, which will be
presented before the General Assembly of all
the delegates, and voted on. The application
material must be sent to Oxford University
by Thursday the 1st of December 1994 at the
latest. The essays will be judged by an acade-
mic panel based in Oxford , who will recom-
mend a list of candidates to be invited to the
conference. Please feel free to declare your
interest and don't worry about the subjects
themselves, we work together on this and
we'll make sure that each and every one pro-
duces a good essay and application.
B.E.S.T. : Board of European Students
of Technology : a dynamic pan-european stu-
dent organisation. Imperial College is very
privileged to be its representative in the
London area, i.e. the local BEST group.
BEST involves nearly all the leading techni-
cal institutions (universities of Barcelona,
Eindhoven, Lund, Trondheim, Bratislava,
Budapest, Torino, Patras, Lisboa,
Copenhagen, etc.) in a network of exchang-
ing experience and information on technical
and scientific issues. Within BEST and by
means of it, students enjoy the advantages of
widening their educational perspectives by
looking at other peoples' methods and prob-
lems, coming in. contact with Industry on an
international level, learning to communicate
and work effectively with other fellow
Europeans, travelling on limited expense and
really so much more. Last year we nearly lost
all these due to the fact that the previous
European Soc remained inactive for most of
the year. As said previously, this year we are
making a fresh restart; we need more people
to develop our local group, to make our voice
heard to the rest of Europe. We are thinking
of organising a summer course next sum-
mer. In the mean time those who will put
effort into it and can afford to take some time
off will get to be sponsored and travel to meet
with people from other local groups and
share views on e.g. how to shape future engi-
neering education, and go on in the summer
to do a summer course somewhere in Europe.
We meet in Chem. Eng. building,
Lecture Theatre 1 at 13:00 each Monday; if
you really like to travel, to meet fellow
Europeans, to find out what opportunities are
there for you, this is your society. For more
information e-mail us at kh@ee.ic.ac.uk or
b.albinana@ic.ac.uk.
We hope to see you soon.
