Medical Building Trauma
('Horse Play' continued)
when a number of horses
suffered from heat exhaustion. In
Atlanta, where humidity levels
can reach 90%, conditions are
expected to be even worse. The
research, using techniques
developed at Imperial, seeks to
study the effect intense heat,
humidity and solar radiation has
on the horses.
Initial work was done using
treadmills in a simulated
environment in Newmarket. It
culminated in a visit to Atlanta
with six horses. Dr Schroter is in
the process of compiling an
index to define minimum
standards of event length,
conditions and acclimatisation
periods that the horses require.
The Physiological Flow
Studies Group in the Bagrit
Centre, hidden away in the
basement of the mechanical
engineering department, has
undertaken a number of projects
into animal welfare. As well as
the trip to the US, Dr Schroter
has been to Morocco to study
camels, Antarctica to investigate
the penguins and Ethiopia to
research cows. He says, "Animals
are far better than we are at
tolerating stress."

Imperial College has this week
submitted revised, downsized
plans for the new Basic Medical
Sciences (BMS) building.
The new building, also to
include the Biology Department,
was originally costed at £72
million. Following informal
discussions with the HEFCE
working group, Imperial College
has downgraded its estimates by
£ l l m . Dr Rodney Eastwood,
Deputy Director of Estates, has
confirmed to F E L I X that the
proposed spending of £62m is
officially being split into £45m
for the medical side, and the
same original estimate of £16m
for the Biology part.
Dr Eastwood has admitted
that negotiations are at a very
delicate stage with the concerned
parties, which include the three
west London postgraduate
medical schools. The removal of
students from the two hospital
sites may also result in funding
from the Department of Health
(DoH), following the possible
sale of the area vacated by
preclinical personnel. The
medical part of the BMS
building should be 100%
externally funded according to
Dr Eastwood, with the new
Imperial College Medical School
accepting undergraduates in
October 1998.
F E L I X has learned that the
Biology part of the building will
only be 25% funded by HEFCE,
the extra £12 million having to
be met by Imperial College. Mr
Mike Hansen, Director of
Finance, has insisted that there
will not be a problem finding
this money, either internally
through College funds or
externally by borrowing from
banks. He said that the 'most
appropriate manner of financing
would be decided at the time
according to Imperial's financial
forecast and tax efficiency'.
The combined intake of up
to 1000 extra students on the
South Kensington site, will force
the introduction of extra student
facilities. While no extension of
Union space has been agreed, the
removal of the Biology
Department from the Beit Quad
will leave possibilities open for
the redevelopment of that area
into student accommodation.
The lack of any medical library
facilities in the Central Library
has resulted in the inclusion in
the plans of an extra floor on top
of the present building. This
would include a new 350 seat
lecture theatre which would in
part replace those in the Old
Chemistry building, which is
due to be demolished.
With the proposal to start
building during the end of 1995,
the Biology Department is said
to welcome the move to new
purpose-built facilities, where it
will share certain equipment
with the medical schools. St
Mary's students are somewhat
apprehensive about the move,
but their President, Claire
Maloney, has guardedly wel-
comed the plans. With a large
canteen, and space for the new
Constituent College Union
offices included in the proposals,
Miss Maloney said that it is
looking, "all right as far as
recreational space is concerned."
Dr Eastwood emphasised
that all these plans are
dependent on the approval of
funds from H E F C E and the
DoH, and that final allocation of
space will only be decided after
the commitment of these bodies.

It has been a couple years now
since I went through my
depressed and delayed post-
adolescent trauma. Feeling
profoundly disillusioned, I read
through the philosophers until I
got to the existentialists and ran
away. I read of political ideals
and swung left to right and back
again more times than Attila the
Hun on a playground swing. I
was the kind of communist who
was too anarchic to ever get
together and who, besides, was
studying a degree in order to,
presumably, make lots of money.
Like the majority of people
who stare at books or the wall too
long, I started to see nothing but
my shadow and the thin cracks
which run through everything. I
got to the point where I realised
that all anyone really has is
themselves: not only in terms of
someone to rely on or to truly
understand but in the sense that
the only place where most of us
can embody our ideas is within.
How many of the great thinkers
were ever able to put their ideas
into practice? All doctrine is
corrupted once implemented and
besides, a doctrine isn't the sum
of a person's beliefs, it's more like
a newspaper photograph of the
moon. White but made of holes,
only an approximation which on
the macro scale appears fine but
under close inspection falls apart.
Life is more subtle and chaotic
than the old ideas could dream of.
How many of us really think
about fidelity to our beliefs? I
realised a couple of weeks ago,
during the Careers Fair, that I
have all but forgotten the concept
of getting a job or responsibly
sorting my life out. I've had
ideas, the kind you would expect
of a computer science trained
arty-editor, but mostly the
feeling has been the long leftover
'I'll write a book and it will
vindicate anything I do, however
mediocre.' The only way to
proceed was to stand still and let
the rest of the banal, author-
itarian, screwed up world proceed
in its weary way.
Maybe I'm getting old but
this doesn't seem good enough
anymore. I'm afraid of waking up
thirty five years old with nothing
to show for my conviction that
the world was a b a d p l a c e but
a lifetime avoiding it.
This week a rather unique
individual from the crew on the
right has made me think about
making my place within it.
Pulling people together and, in
some small but brilliant way,
making things happen. Talks
about forming a company of like-
minded spirits and burning true
to your ideals - avoiding the
bureaucratic multi-layered
industrial landscape like a pre-
revolutionary plague. But am I
just trying to believe this to cash
in on the reality of the next fifty
years? Or do we all stumble here
eventually? Maybe, but we are all
dying here regardless...
