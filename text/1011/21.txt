green day - we/come fo paradise
It's a nice single despite the
standard, cheesy indie cover art
Whilst crunching out some decent
punk-like tunes they manage to
pull off a passable British accent.
beasfie boys - sura shot
The Seastte Boys belt out a load of
white rap andjf's pretty good.
francis dunnery -
what's he go'i 10 -J
The stripped down edit is easier to
stomach than the glossy, cherry-
on-top Ip version. Dunnery has a
good voice and he comes out
better on the disc's other two
acoustic tracks.
barter usm - Jet's get tatoos
Mmmm. There's an attempted
punk feel here. The singer's got a
bit of that Johnny Rotten twang
but it's not belching bad boy punk.
Despite the free tattoos it's not
really going to make me dye my
hair, hit the streets and become
everyone's sisters' nightmare.
echobelly - close...but
Hey! This is good. Happy-go-
lucky singing meets hard edged
accompaniment. The two live
tracks are quite good in terms of
quality and performance.
andromeda strain - idol ep
Very reminiscent of the cure - if
you ignore the paganisfic
references. I
t gets a small case
'okay' from this reviewer.
new order - true faith 94 :>
it's a fairly decent single of four
remixes of a fairly mainstream
song. The song's fairly easy
listening too,'&-:

bad blood, nightmares and slackers
It's amazing how you can almost
get away without a decent film plot
these days. Take Flesh and Bone
for instance. A family are murdered
during a robbery and only the baby
survives. Twenty years later that
grown baby [Meg Ryan) gets
involved with the son of the trigger
happy thug who shot them. She's
been told that her family were
killed in a car crash but the son
(Dennis Quaid) knows the truth.
And then the father (James Caan)
turns up. Tenuous is probably the
most charitable thing you can say.
Yet for all its unbelievability you do
come away from Flesh and Bone
with some feeling of perverted
satisfaction.
In part it's to do with the solid
performances of the actors. Quaid's
character, Arlis, plows the lonely
interstate of life, filling vending
machines with blue chickens called
Betty, cans of chilli and boxes of
prophylatics. More than a creature
of habit, he has become a hermit of
the road. The landscapes he
encounters are flat, horizontally
bound, dusty and most importantly,
empty. His father and his childhood
have reduced him to a hollow man,
emotionally bereft. Ryan is always
at home with her home girl gone
slightly skewy character and Caan
plays the grizzled old wolf with two
dimensional ease. Still the problem
is that these players never connect
believably within the stretch of
credibility which the plot asks us to
believe is cinematic reality.
Only the end scene really
works and that because it plugs
straight into the bedrock of Quaid's
character. No romantic foolery
here, even with his real life wife.
Just as the camera pans from a
fuzzy image of blonde hair and
cowboy boots up and out to the
straight edged Texan plains so,
albeit briefly, we can see the wider
picture. A film with good genes, it
just needed a bit of free thinking
rebellion somewhere along the line.
The Rank preview theatre is a
sleaze-free zone. Pundits are not
plied with bowls of peanuts, plates
of sandwiches or other disincentives
to objectivity. In fact, for this
particular film it would have been a
bit of a waste. Even a sackful of
tortilla chips would not have caused
your sea-green incorruptible critic
to swerve from his duty of revealing
to the world the truly dire nature of
Dream Lover.
In a film that has nothing
whatsoever to do with snooker,
James Spader plays Ray Reardon, a
rich, handsome yuppie architect
and all-round smoothie. Ray's most
distinctive feature is the habit of
baring his top teeth in a rictus that
leaves the viewer unsure whether
he is about to laugh, sneer or bite
someone. He falls for Lena
(Mddchen Am/ck), who tells him she
was abused by her parents. This I
can believe, since her sultry pout
looks like the result of having had
her lips clamped together with
clothespegs throughout her
childhood.
They shag (but on the second
date, not the first - who says
Hollywood isn't setting a high moral
tone?) they marry, they have kids.
But Ray begins to suspect that his
perfect partner has a past murkier
than the drab shades of lipstick she
favours. He starts to dream that
he's in a tacky circus arcade, trying
to win the ideal wife. Is he
paranoid? I
s she a psycho after his
lucre? Slack and unoriginal, the
plot spirals into ludicrousness when
Ray lands up in the loony-bin. (
I
began to suspect that Lena is kinky
and wants to be abused, but then
I'm just a chauvinist male who's
seen Blue Velvet.) I
f you're unlucky
enough to find yourself at this film,
do what Ray should have done and
get out after the f*ck scene.
My Life's in Turnaround is a
low budget independent film from
America. At the start of the film,
Splick (Eric Shaeffer) and Jason
(Donald Ward) are two pretty
aimless people. Splick works as a
cab driver and Jason is a bar
tender. Splick is having troubles
trying to find the right woman,
while Jason, (long haired and with
a goatie beard) is surrounded with
'fourteen' year old models. Their
means of self expression to the
public is via the stage with a
mixture of verse and a play on
words, which lasts seconds and is
totally incomprehensible. So after
many scathing reviews they decide
to turn their attention to film.
However they have no script,
money or stars.
The whole script is loaded with
hilarious one liners and sharp and
well constructed scenes. I
t proved
to be thoroughly entertaining. One
of its many subplots is a rant
against the Hollywood industry. In
one scene they have a meeting with
a 'big' producer. After asking them
if their film was a 'Harry Met Sally'
or a 'Lethal Weapon' type film, he
throws them out of a restaurant for
saying that the film was a
documentary about themselves.
Slackers!
Hopefully this film will end up
in a cinema, but you never can tell
with low budget films, especially
those that send up Hollywood and^
all that. Â©
