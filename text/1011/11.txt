The Criminal Justice Bill (now an Act
of Parliament) has over 100 clauses
dealing with matters as diverse as
lowering the age of consent for
homosexuals to the withdrawal of
the right to silence. Despite the
repetitive sensationalism surroun-
ding the bill, to many the actual
content is unclear. Here we outline
some of the new laws that have
caused the most controversy.
Right to Silence
• A court can now draw inferences from a
suspects' refusal to give evidence or cooperate
with enquiries i.e. the suspect will no longer
have the right to silence.
Trespasser; assemblies
clauses 65 - 66
• These have made available an order
banning assemblies likely to be held, without
the owners' permission, which may result in
"serious disruption to the life of the
community".
• A similar order may be attained for public
land if access is limited.
• The police are then allowed to stop and re-
direct anyone reasonably suspected of
travelling to such a gathering.
