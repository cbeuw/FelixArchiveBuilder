"The barbarians are of
course the scientists
Zito the Magician
To amuse His Royal Majesty he will
change water into wine. Frogs into
footmen. Beetles into bailiffs. And
make a minister out of a rat. He
bows, and daisies grow from his
finger-tips. And a talking bird sits
on his shoulder.
There.
Think up something else, demands
His Royal Majesty. Think up a black
star. So he thinks up a black star.
Think up dry water. So he thinks up
dry water. Think up a river bound
with straw. So he does.
There.
Then along comes a student and
asks: Think up sine alpha greater
than one.
And Zito grows pale and sad:
Terribly sorry. Sine is between one
and minus one. Nothing you can do
about that.
And he leaves the great royal
empire, quietly weaves his way
through the throng of courtiers, to
his home in a nutshell.

The discourse which has occurred between
poets and scientists has not been voluminous.
Yet it has displayed certain characteristic
traits. Prior to the Newtonian revolution
there was a commonly held view that both
the poet and the natural philosopher (as the
scientist was then termed) were engaged in
the same sort of world. Just as natural
philosophy concerned itself with such ideals
as the mysteries of life and alchemy, both of
these programmes being linked by an
underlying belief in the unity of nature, so
the poets dreamed within the same paradigm.
It was in the wake of Newton that the
break was made. The poet Samuel Taylor
Coleridge made this explicit with his
famous comparison: "I believe
the souls of five
hundred Sir Isaac
Newtons would
go to the
making up of a
Shakespeare
or a Milton".
It is
interesting that
Coleridge was
not 'anti-
science'.Indeed
he maintained a
friendship with
Humphry Davy,
amongst other
prominent natural
philosophers of his day.
Rather Coleridge was critical
of the change of spirit that
Newtonianism brought and to a great extent
this is the situation that remains today.
Paradoxically, however, the
stereotypical view of scientists is that 'it is
obvious that science and poetry are
synonymous'. Obviously few suggest that the
disciplines are the exactly the same but the
consensus view amongst scientists is that they
are as good at doing poetry as anyone else. In
fact when it comes to scientific poetry it's
true that scientists are the only poets.
Plugging into CP Snow mode, when 'we' are
doing a poem about the second law of
thermodynamics, say, both the writing and
understanding of the resulting opus is limited
to scientists as no-one else even understands
the underlying concept involved!
It was with such thoughts in mind that
I ventured to the bastion of artiness that is
the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) for
a lecture called 'Transfusions: science into
poetry'. Of the three speakers only one
resonated. His name was Miroslav Holub.
Miroslav has had a varied career, as
always seems to be the case with such people.
An early training in greek and latin lead on
to the study of medicine, philosophy and
history of science and pathology. He became
the editor of the Czech equivalent of New
Scientist, an international expert in the
immunology of 'nude mice', the author of
fourteen books of poetry and also gained the
political stature of someone who was a
'non-person' between 1970-1980,
thanks to the Czech
government. So if anyone
is a good example of
the two culture in
one, it is Miroslav.
Perhaps the most
surprising phrase
he uttered that
entire night was
"science
corrodes the
soul of the
poet".
As a stand
alone item this is an
extremely provoking
statement but what does
it actually mean? In
personal terms Miroslav
recognised several differences
between science and poetry.
For example scientists don't use as
many different ideas and words as poets.
Scientists don't deal with personal issues in
their work - instead they stick to universal
concerns. Scientists don't answer useful
questions, only solvable ones. In this way you
can not be a (good) poet whilst acting as a
scientist. There is a duality in roles.
Perhaps this is made more clear by the
poem on the left, Zito the Magician. As
Miroslav comments, "in the use of words and
statements poetry and science move in
different and opposite directions". They are
not concerned with the same things so we
should not attempt to make them so.
Thefinal lecture in the ICA series, 'Taking
the pulse: poetry examined' is held on the 23rd of
November at 7.30pm, box office 0171 930 3647.
