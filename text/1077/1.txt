Explosion shatters chemistry lab
KELLY ROBINSON
The normal routine of the Chemistry
Department was disrupted last week
by an incident in the RCS1 building.
At 11am last Thursday the Tilden
Laboratory, on the second floor of
the block, was ripped apart by an
explosion.
The source of the explosion was
traced to a fume cupboard in use at
the time by two post-graduate stu-
dents conducting an ether distillation
experiment. Despite being present in
the room, both escaped uninjured.
According to an eyewitness, there
was an initial "bang" and the fume
cupboard burst into flames. A wall of
fire engulfed one side of the room,
blocking the main exit.
The force of the explosion caused
considerable damage, though the fire,
which involved approximately 1.5
litres of ether, quickly burned itself
out. Several windows in the lab and
in adjacent rooms were shattered and
much of the ducting system leading
from the fume cupboard through to
the roof also suffered substantial
damage. Some debris from this duct-
ing landed on the upper working
level of the BMS site, and glass from
the laboratory windows landed

between site huts. Some debris was
found in Imperial Institute Road out-
side Civil Engineering.
The iron bolt on the door leading
from the Tilden Lab to an adjacent
office was blown apart, and a refrig-
erator containing toxic chemicals
was propelled through the doorway.
Two members of staff, wearing
breathing apparatus, emptied the
aforementioned fridge and later
transferred its contents to another
store.
There was a slight time lapse
between the explosion and the arrival
on the scene of the officials con-
cerned. This was in part due to the
fire-alarm system in the Tilden Lab
not being connected to the alarms in
the rest of the building because of an
earlier failure of the temporary bat-
tery back-up system for the other
alarms. This in turn had been in oper-
ation for only eight hours because of
an electrical fault in the Library when
the fuse box fused. The state of the
fire alarms was -described by one
member of the Chemistry
Department as "ludicrously danger-
ous". However, staff arrived quickly
and began enquiries immediately.

Imperial takes University Challenge to USA
A L O K J H A
Imperial College's 1995/6 University
Challenge team, winners BBC2 quiz
show's coveted trophy last year, are
to enter another competition, this
time in America.
The Imperial College team are the
only team from Britain to enter in the
National Academic Quiz Tourn-
aments' National Championship and
were given a wildcard entry due to
their successes last year.
The NAQT waived the entry fee to
the tournament for the team and has
also provided them with accomoda-
tion for its duration. This left other
costs, including food and air fares,
that would have had to be paid for by
the members of the team themselves.
Jim Totty, a member of the winning
team was refused financial assistance
by College, which then led him to
submit a request for help to the
Union on behalf of Mark Pallen,
Chris Harrison and Ian Bayley, all
members of the Union. The request
was granted and a total of Â£427 was
paid to the team, on the condition that
they wear Union shirts for the com-
petition. This was agreed, provided
that they could get hold of some
before they departed.
The Deputy President for Finance
and Services, Piers Williams, stated
that although the payment was irreg-
ular since they were not a club or
society, he felt that helping them
would provide "good karma" for the
College.
The Imperial College team are
expected to do very well in the tour-
nament itself and Piers Williams sug-
gested that even though College had
refused them financial help, the
College's newspaper, IC Reporter,
would probably be the first to pro-
claim them as heroes on their return
from Philadelphia,
