Goldies flattened by double Dekker
On the 22nd of this month, IC foot-
ball seconds produced a stunning
second half performance to win a
game that Goldsmith's led by four
goals to one at the interval. A strike
either side of half time by Dekker,
the Dutch Destroyer, and four sec-
ond half goals ensured that IC took
all three points and gave their dim
promotion aspirations a flicker of
hope.
With goalkeeper Cook making his
senior debut and the heart of defence
falling victim to flu, captain Fleming
had to shuffle the pack and come up
with a formation that could thwart a
fast and physical Goldsmith's line-
up. The unfamiliarity at the back
caused IC problems and in a sweep-
ing move Goldsmiths scored their
first. From the centre IC immediate-
ly started their usual fluid passing
and within five minutes had levelled
through Dekker with a clinical shot
just inside the post from outside the
box.
This perhaps should have precipi-
tated IC's ascendancy, instead the
defence pressed the self-destruct but-
ton. Cook was the first culprit - poor
handling from a bread-and-butter
shot gave the centre forward the ball
who finished from a seemingly
impossible angle. Next was Fleming
- from a lofted, defence-splitting ball
he found himself under pressure
from the forward and lobbed the
advancing Cook from fully twenty-
five yards out. A spectacular effort,
unfortunately in the wrong goal!
Soon afterwards in left-back Siverns
found himself in near identical cir-
cumstances and, so as not to be out-
done by his captain, lobbed Cook
again.
The second half was a different
story. Goldsmiths hardly touched the
ball as it was stroked about the pitch
by the reds. The defence was as tight
as a vice; the midfield masterful with
Ubogu winning everything; the strik-
ers a constant menace to the bewil-
dered Goldsmith's defence. Soon the
patience and pressure produced a
goal - a loose ball came to Ferguson
on the edge of the area, he dropped a
shoulder and floated it beautifully
into the top corner.
Minutes later IC were awarded a
heavily disputed indirect free-kick
from six yards after a back pass.
Shanidze touched it to Dekker who
rifled it above the heads of the play-
ers on the line.
Still the pressure continued
unabated and still Goldsmiths found
no answer. An high corner from
Schroeder was headed down,
towards goal by Ubogu. Dunsby, in
the thick of the action as he had been
throughout, received it; turned and
shot all in one motion - doubling his
account for the season and squaring
the game at four each.
Both teams by now sensed the
inevitable and when the ball came to
Archbald in the Goldsmith's area
minutes from time he efficiently
stuck it away and finished the match.
The seconds: first for class, first for
entertainment.
IC lis 5 - 4 Goldsmiths
IC Skiing Team excel - at last
Despite a lot of bad luck in the past
few races, the IC Ski Team came
fighting back last Saturday evening
with a strong team performance.
Dan Figueras Niero, Rufina Emo,
Nick Hursemax, Alex Cherdel and
Xavier Grosliebe travelled up to
Hemel Hempstead to participate in
the "Huskies" race and achieved
some excellent results with some
inspired individual efforts.
The race consisted of two individ-
ual, timed runs down a slalom
course; followed by a team dual
slalom. In the individual slalom,
Rufina was placed first in her age
category despite a blunder by the
organisers in believing that we were
fielding a male team, and second
overall in the ladies with a total time
of 35 seconds exactly, whilst Nick
was placed second in his category
with a time of 33.96s. Furthermore
the team won the individual com-
bined slalom event with a total time
of 140.68s and were placed second in
the team dual slalom. These impres-
sive results are a definite boost to
team morale. Keep it up lads and
Rufina!
Team Combined Slalom: 1st
Team Dual Slalom: 2nd
The fourths go marching on...
As usual, we won, they lost.
However, they didn't just lose, they
bore the brunt of the fourth's most
impressive performance this season,
and were thrashed into submission
by a team seemingly possessed by
the spirit of Brazil 1970.
The pressure built in the first half,
a shot off the inside of their past and
another blatantly handled on the line.
With the ref still in the wrong half
our calls for a penalty were ignored.
But justice came with a fantastic div-
ing header - albeit by a Holloway
defender - which put us one up at
half-time.
And so the floodgates opened. The
Holloway team was helpless in
defending wave after wave of our
attacks. Like Moses parting the Red
Sea we pulled apart their defence
with our vision and movement.
Adam finally scored after hitting
the post in his last three games and
Morgan shrugged off defenders to
slot in the third. The blitzkrieg on the
Holloway box led to a swivelled shot
by Pistol Pete - our number four. Nak
put on a star performance, taking no
prisoners and scoring brilliantly
twice from twenty yards. A l l this
without Dazzler anywhere to be
seen...
We worked together like a well
oiled unit (ooer) to demolish the
league leader's pride and self-
esteem. With a game in hand and
three points between us and the top
the championship looks within our
grasp.
Inevitably they scored the obliga-
tory goal from a corner but who
cares? Roll on the last thirty-two in
BUSA and the grudge match against
the seconds.
IC IVs 6 - 1 Royal Holloway
.and on.
The fourths are now officially top of
the league. With all the other
Imperial football teams struggling
we are surely the best football team
in Imperial. This will be confirmed
when we win BUSA(!), and sooner
still beat the IC seconds in a chal-
lenge match in few weeks time.
Chris scored in the first minute of
the match and we never looked back.
The graceful Morgan danced
through to score, and the rotund
Darren slotted another home with
our defence hardly troubled. Surely
we will walk this league as
Champions [if our enormous egos
don't get in the way - Sports Eds].
