FELIX FRIDAY 31ST IANUARY SPORT 15
M a r y ' s c r u i s e t h r o u g h t o S e m i s
As the sun struck the lush green
fields of a sleepy Chislehurst on a
Tuesday afternoon you could cut the
atmosphere with a cliche. The two
rival camps of supporters gathered to
cheer on their respective teams.
While UCH ran out looking around
nervously, Mary's stormed out -
focused and full of determination.
This attitude continued straight from
the kickoff into the match.
It was our kick and the forwards
charged through to win a ball that
should not have been theirs, rucking
impressively to a position in front of
the posts. They had no option but to
kill the ball and Nev slotted away the
penalty for three points. From the
restart there was a similar story and
Nev again put the kick away for six-
nil.
The third kick-off saw their for-
wards getting it right and slowed
down our drive but only for our
backs to break through with Will
Jackson and Ollie Kayes. Faced with
this onslaught they infringed again,
with Nev opting for the line out this
time. From here Tremmor won good
ball and Bill Tuff drove into the heart
of the UCH defence. As the forwards
neared the line Phil Sauve at scrum-
half showed he too could drive and
forced the ball over the line.
After dominating for much of the
first quarter UCH started to get back
into the game. First of all they tried
the direct approach, only to find the
tackles of Lidely and Jackson a bit
hard for their liking. The kicking
strategy was next employed but
Platty, Lee and Rogers were more
than a match for it. They managed to
gain three points, however, after an
infringement in the ruck was
penalised. Their supporters cheered
the first points they had scored
against St Mary's for quite a while.
Whilst their celebrations contin-
ued we got back into the task at hand.
Ban and Tremmor won good balls
from lineouts and Tufty and Sankey
were both clearing and driving.
Some incisive running from Ollie
sent Simon Rogers away to score
next to the posts.
The half ended with brief
exchanges between the two sides,
with U C H beginning to play with
more urgency, but our line never
wavered. The only bad points were
another penalty for them and Ollie
having to go off with a broken nose.
Rob Elliot replaced him and did a
fine job starting where Ollie had left
off.
The second half started with some
more power play from our forwards,
but as it progressed things again
became more frantic as befits a cup
match. They pressed again and won
another penalty. The only highlight
of this half was another run from
Roger - breading through the line
from full-back to settle the match
twenty-five to nine.
We progress to the semi-finals
knowing that arch-rivals Charring
Cross will play no farther part in the
competition as they crashed out thir-
ty to eight against UMDS.
St Mary's 25 - 9 UCH
Fatboy crowned King
With the football seconds looking to
build on last weeks glorious victory,
the game began with captain Steve
picking a formation literally out of a
hat and urging the lads to "Show 'em
what we can do". Unfortunately this
produced the most boring first half in
history, with all concerned agreeing
the we were "worse than the Villa"
[Arsenal, surely - Sports Eds].
The second half saw the arrival of
Dave who replaced Andy, and Dixon
who Steve enticed onto the pitch
with the promise of pies. With the
sun at our backs and the wind in our
hair (Phil's, by the smell of it) we
tore into King's with Loz, Felix and
Si all going close. The defence
looked sound, with German breaking
legs whenever he felt it was neces-
sary and Rob playing a blinder at
right back. Dixon was having none
of this, however, and he combined
beautifully with Donal in goal to let
Steve through to score his second
own goal in two games. Bloater
could not be denied his glory as he
summoned up his inner qi and calm-
ly stroked the ball with the King's
defenders nowhere to be seen. This
was followed up by a flick-on to
Martin who put the ball into the net
after kicking their keeper in the teeth.
Good work fella!

Introducing a new regular "external" sports column by
the ever talented and good-looking Dave Robinson.
England have now managed just two
test victories in five winter tours and
both of those when the series were
lost and Australia and the West
Indies had already given up. This
appaling record was furthered earlier
this week when England failed to
win. Unlike most I don't think that
this is an easy tour. Zimbabwe or
New Zealand away was always
going to be tough, but we should
have enough killer instinct to wipe
out anyone who slips up.
England's attack on the first day
and in the late stages of New
Zealand's second innings was
abysmal. Even Atherton himself
admitted it was the worst his side had
ever bowled. But shouldn't he have
been more assertive in attacking?
Couldn't he have surrounded the
heroic Danny Morrison with at least
six fielders when Tuffnell bowled?
Surely he should have instructed
Mullaly to give the tail end the kind
of treatment dished out to us by the
West Indies in 1994? Two 90 mph
bouncers an over would have soft-
ened them sufficiently. And if
England's best couldn't dispose of
the world's worst test batsman',
then why didn't he have an over or
two himself? At least then he could
say he that he had tried everything.
Instead after the match he spouted on
about the match not being won til the
winning runs are struck. Shouldn't
he have explained this to his team
rather than soldiering on hoping to
knock them over eventually?
Captains should make things happen
rather than wait for them.
The obvious upshot from
England's failure over the last few
seasons is to relieve Atherton of the
captaincy and change the squad.
Unfortunately unlike football and
rugby all of England's best are
already selected. There are no natur-
al replacements for any of the post
tions, the only candidate for captain
with experience would be Stewart
and his dips in form make Atherton
look consistent.
Sadly, it looks likely that the tests
in Wellington and here next summer
will follow a similar script with
Atherton, like Gooch, not going until
the Ashes are lost at home.
Even worse than national humilia-
tion down under is the proposed plan
for a two up two down system for
promotion to football's Premiership.
Although I never saw the Football
League do any favours for
Kidderminister, Macclesfield or
Stevenage, I do have some sympa-
thy. The best in the First Division are
becoming stronger than those at the
base of the top flight. Barnsley
Bolton and Sheffield United all play
better than the bottom half and would
give West Ham, Southampton and
Middlesborough a run for their con
siderable riches. The British system
relies on the realisation of aspirations
and hopes. Any attempts to stifle this
will create a less interesting national
game. Any team out of the race will
see gates and funds plummet. The
teams up there have had a windfall
that effectively cuts off all but the
clubs managed by geniuses. If the
entry is reduced to two a season the
best players will stay in reserve
teams rather than drop down a divi
sion with the prospect of promotion
and consequently any side that goes
up will do a Swindon, conceding
over a hundred goals and getting
only a handful of points. The only
consolation is that the football league
will be able to say no - but will they
hold out with the huge financial bribe
the big clubs can and no doubt will
offer in an attempt to buy security?
Thrice-conquering hockey babes kick butt
It was muddy, it was cold and it was
shite, but the ladies firsts were out
there on a grass pitch at Royal
Holloway to fight for a place in the
final of the U L plate. Half time
approached with no goals scored but
that's not surprising as half the team
- especially Basil - spent most of the
time in the puddles on their bums.
The second half included one
extremely beautiful slide tackle from
Sarah Corneille (!) and in the last
five minutes our star player, Lucy
"Humming bird" Robinson, got the
well deserved goal. One-nil for the
IC and off to the finals we go.
IC I 1-0 Royal Holloway I
Next was the league match against
QMW. Great hockey from the for-
wards, great hockey from the mid-
field, great hockey from the backs
and Laura I'm sure you would've
been great if the ball had come your
way. IC swept the opposition away
with a ten-nil win!

Wednesday saw another game at
QMW and another victory with a
