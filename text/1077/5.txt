Medics deprived
of clean undies
KENT YIP
Washing facilities for residents of
Wilson House will be temporarily
out of action, starting from 3rd
February. The installation of new
machines is expected to take approx-
imately a month. Meanwhile, resi-
dents have been advised to make
alternative arrangements.
The current contract was ended
when the company from which the
machines were hired withdrew their
support and maintenance services.
Due to their old age, the current
machines break down frequently and
have to be repaired on a regular
basis. The eight new machines and
tumble dryers shortly to be installed
will double the capacity of the cur-
rent washroom.
funding, but went on to point out that
a new freezer had recently been pur-
chased, and it would only be a matter
of time before the promise was ful-
filled.
Residents have also expressed dis-
satisfaction at the lack of shower
provision. When confronted with
reports suggesting that in some hous-
es up to fifteen people have to share
one shower, Ms Brown recounted
the difficulties involved in fitting
new showers over the existing baths.
"Everything has to be watertight,
which means that tiles have to be
secured and the bath resealed. This
had been done in other halls before,
and poor workmanship led to the col-
lapse of the ceiling and water leaking
badly all over the floor. There is also
Speaking to Felix, Head of
Accommodation Sharine Brown
acknowledged the enormous incon-
venience to students that this change
will cause. Plans to provide a limited
number of in-house machines during
the transition period are under con-
sideration, and the College will offer
affected students a refund to cover
washing expenses. Recognising that
some students might find the level of
refund insufficient, Ms Brown
claimed she would be prepared to
discuss this matter with those con-
cerned on an individual basis.
Another concern of Wilson House
residents has been the lack of a freez-
er in each kitchen, contrary to the
description given in the Residents'
Handbook. Ms Brown admitted that
it would be impossible to equip
every kitchen with its own freezer by
the end of this year due to a lack of
the problem of getting the mix of
water right at the tap." A new show-
er has been installed in one house,
which serves as a trial for all future
developments.
Also high on the agenda for
Wilson House is the need to improve
security. Current suggestions include
the installation of a swipe card sys-
tem and closed-circuit camera sur-
veillance. Officials are currently
assessing the cost of improvements,
with 24 hour security provision, by
far the most expensive option, still
considered a possibility. Mrs Brown
refuted suggestions that provisions
such as washing up liquids and
kitchen towels have been withdrawn
in order to fund new security equip-
ment, explaining that these measures
were taken merely to bring Wilson
House in line with all other halls of
residence of Imperial College.
School leavers
opt for physics
P A U L SQUIRES
Imperial College's Physics depart-
ment has seen an unexplained
increase in the number of applicants
for undergraduate degree courses.
This has been reflected at a national
level.
This increase has occurred despite
decisions by many leading universi-
ties to axe their physics degrees.
Birkbeck College, London, and East
Anglia, Coventry, De Montfort, and
Manchester Metropolitan
Universities are all cutting back on
physics courses, in accord with
downward trends in the subject's
popularity over recent years. The
University and College Admissions
Service, UCAS, reports that the
nationwide numbers of physics
applicants represents an increase as
high as 18% compared to last year,
while Dr R Burns, IC Physics
Admissions Tutor, believes the
increase is in the region of 10-15% at
Imperial. This increase appears to be
peculiar to physics, no comparable
increase having been observed in any
other scientific discipline with the
exception of Chemistry, which has
seen a slight rise.
The state of physics in Britain's
Universities has recently been the
subject of much pessimistic report-
ing by the media, which have made
much of the cuts imposed by the
aforementioned institutions. Prof B
Morgan, Deputy Head of the Physics
Department, pointed out that almost
all those colleges axing physics are
comparatively new institutions.
None of them, Prof Morgan claims,
are noted for their research in this
field, and therefore they receive very
little research funding. This reduces
the cost-effectiveness of employing
lecturers to teach physics. Their deci-
sions should not, Prof Morgan
believes, be considered indicative for
the physics departments of institu-
tions such as Imperial, which have an
excellent reputation in this field.
Head of the Physics Department,
Professor D Southwood, professed
his regrets that industry in general
does not recognise the importance of
physics in a technically advanced
market. Professor Morgan agreed
that physics as a discipline is com-
paratively remote from industrial
need, as advances in pure physics
take many years before they are any
use in industry, by which time they
are more likely to be considered
engineering.
As a result, physics research tends
to receive very little support from
private firms. Several years ago the
government introduced the ROPA
award system by which departments
can claim funding from the govern-
ment in proportion to the amount
they have received from industry.
Initially the system did not favour
physicists, though this has been
addressed by the efforts of many pro-
fessors and the Institute of Physics.
The two main forms of Higher
Education funding are teaching fund-
ing and research funding. Both types
of grant come from HEFCE, the
Higher Education Funding Council
for England, and in both categories
physics has fared badly. Teaching
funding is based on student intake,
which is low for physics, while
research funding is based on the
number of teaching staff in the
department. This is also low com-
pared to other disciplines, although
IC's physics department has not been
seriously affected; HEFCE does not
require that the money allocated per
department be spent solely upon that
particular faculty, and it is Imperial
College policy to distribute funds
equally between the various depart-
ments.
