Waterstone's on JANET?
MICHAEL ROBERTS
Another aspect of Waterstone's
Bookstore tender has come under
suspicion with the revelation that the
company plan to use JANET for
their retail plans. In their tender,
Waterstone's made a big selling
point of their proposed use of the
internet, emphasising in particular
the ability to order and buy books
electronically.
The Joint Academic NETwork is
used by universities, colleges and
research organisations throughout
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
There are direct links to networks in
Europe and the USA, through which
JANET forms part of the Global
Internet and Special Interest Groups.
JANET is operated and managed
by the JNT Association Ltd, a 'not-
for-profit' company regulated by
U KERN A, the United Kingdom
Education and Research Networking
Association.
According to UKERNA rules, an
organisation may gain entry to
JANET provided it falls into one of
the approved categories. It must be a
degree awarding institution, an insti-
tution that teaches at tertiary level
(including sixth-form colleges) and
above, an institution that conducts
research where a reasonable propor-
tion of the results are placed in the
public domain, or a "learned soci-
ety". Also accepted are further and
higher education funding councils,
research councils or organisations
whose primary purpose is the sup-
port of education in a capacity other
than for commercial gain.
According to Karen Griffin of
JANET Customer Services,
Waterstone's have not as yet submit-
ted any application to be allowed to
use the network. Furthermore,
despite their location within an acad-
emic institute, they could still end up
being prohibited from using JANET.
It is clear that the new bookstore
will be accessible via electronic mail
and the World Wide Web within the
internal Imperial College network. If
it is to be visible to organisations out-
side College, it will effectively be
using JANET without permission.
An internet book ordering service is
already operated by the current
bookstore and the Union's tender
proposal included a commitment to
continue such a service.

Chemistry explosion
continued from front page
The incident was reported to the
Health and Safety Executive, in
accordance with regulations, at
11.15am.
Several people present when the
explosion occurred, including Dr
Graham Saville of the Chemical-
Engineering Department who was
an expert advisor on the Piper Alpha
inquiry, were involved in the initial
investigation. A thorough enquiry
into the circumstances of the explo-
sion is currently under way, but as
yet its exact causes are unknown.
The suspect experiment had been
checked thirty seconds before the
incident and nothing appeared to be
amiss with the distillation process.
It is suspected that the Teflon seal
on the distillation flask did not fit
perfectly, allowing ether vapour to
escape into the fume cupboard. Due
to some confusion about the two
electrical control switches present in
the lab, it appears that the cupboard's
extraction fan was not turned on,
allowing the vapour, from whatever
origin, to build up. The ignition
source has not been isolated.
According to Ian Gillett, Safety
Director, all those involved were
extremely helpful, including Schal,
the contractors working on the BMS
building. He said the laboratory
should "realistically be fit for use by
students within about one month"
but it all depends on the insurance
company involved and those who
will receive the contract for the
extensive reconstruction work.
Elsewhere, the water leak that
caused temporary power failures in
the Library and Sherfield Building
(as reported in last week's Felix) has
come under scrutiny following the
revelation by one electrician working
on repairs that water "had been leak-
ing for some time" into the generator
room. Keith Reynolds, Head of Fire
and Security, was quick to reassure
Felix that the leakage had presented
no danger.
Heavier rain over the previous few
days is thought to have been respon-
sible for the accident.
News in Brief
A C C CHAIR RESIGNS
ICU sports clubs were shocked last
week by the sudden resignation of
Caroline Deetjen, the Athletic Clubs
Committee Chair.
Ms Deetjen, currently in the final
year of her Chemical Engineering
degree, explained, "I felt I was over-
committing myself, and wasn't giv-
ing the ACC the time and credit it
deserved. M y work was falling
behind, and I felt strained, unhappy
and dissatisfied with my perfor-
mance. Something had to give, and
as I'm here to gain a degree it had to
be the ACC."
Sarah Corneille, ICU Deputy
President for Clubs and Societies,
said of Ms Deetjen "We're sorry to
see Caroline go, she has done a great
job until now."
Ms Corneille will take over the
post until the next ACC meeting, at
which the Vice-Chair is expected to
be appointed as the permanent
replacement.
BICYCLE THIEF C H A R G E D
Charges have been brought against a
man arrested in Ayrton Road shortly
before the Christmas holidays for
carrying equipment with the obvious
purpose of stealing bicycles. The
arrest was made partly based on
information from a student.
Police are continuing inquiries
into the incident and Security offi-
cers are receiving extra training in
dealing with such occurrences as
bicycle theft.
There are many ways of combat-
ting bicycle theft. Most cyclists in
London own D-locks designed to be
extremely effective against attempts
to cut through them, but some "pro-
fessional" thieves may possess
equipment to cut through even these.
College security recommend that
those who bring bicycles to College
take the trouble to leave them at
facilities provided for this purpose
situated just off the main walkway
next to the Royal School of Mines,
which is covered by twenty-four
hour CCTV surveillance.
C L A Y P O N D S BURGLAR
S E N T E N C E D
Last week, a burglar was sentenced
to five years imprisonment after
being caught breaking into
Clayponds hall of residence in Ealing
last term. He was captured and
arrested by College Security as he
was making his escape. A second
burglar, who was caught at the same
time, is serving a two-year prison
sentence.
