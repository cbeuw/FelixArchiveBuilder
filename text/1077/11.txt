FELIX FRIDAY 31ST IANUARY COLUMNS 11
People these days are obsessed with
money. Not exactly a startling reve-
lation and a bit rich coming from
you, I hear you cry. But the interest-
ing thing about the current nature of
this obsession is that it does not
encompass care of money. The pub-
lic will happily waste, or see wasted,
enormous sums on pointless activi-
ties (such as the lottery), yet appar-
ently play merry hell when relatively
trifling projects are proposed.
As you probably realised, dear
reader, I am referring to the replace-
ment for Britannia. At £60 million,
this represents about 75 minutes gov-
ernment spending. It is not, as some
have suggested, a private plaything
for the Royal Family, but a means for
the Queen to discharge her duties as
head of state, in much the same way
as Bill Clinton uses Air Force One.
Given our strong maritime heritage,
a prestigious British-built yacht
seems the perfect solution.
All talk that this money should be
spent on education looks pretty flim-
sy in the light of the £2.5 billion to be
spent on the cattle cull to satisfy a
German food minister who constant-
ly moves the goalposts of lifting the
ban.
It also looks weak following the pub-
lication of results that show that in
some London boroughs, at the age of
seven, the reading age gap between
the best and the worst is up to three
years. Spend, spend spend is the
mantra of both the opposition parties,
but this is shown to be ridiculous
when one also reads that the country
with the highest standards of English
in the world is

are incapable of realising the damage
of their actions, it is about time that
strict guidelines on primary educa-
tion were introduced. In other words,
turn the clock back thirty years.
I try to avoid writing about my own
department so as not to ignore huge
swathes of you,
my readers, and
also to prevent
streams of abuse
from my elders
and betters. Last
week's explosion
in Old Chemistry
deserves a men-
tion. It is a mira-
cle that no one
was killed during
the incident,
which, without
going to details,
g e n e r a t e d
enough force to
blow a fridge
through a
closed door.
You would
naturally assume that an incident of
this nature would warrant a least a
phone call to London Fire Brigade to
explain what had happened. Not so,
my friends. Now as you know by
now, I have no truck with cynicism,
so I won't suggest, as some are say
ing, that this was to prevent the
Health and Safety Executive getting
wind of it. The apparatus that caused
the fire is in wide use in the depart-
ment and has long been seen as an
accident waiting to happen.
The lab in question only had one
exit. It now, of course, has two, cour
tesy of the fridge. An earlier request
for more fire extinguishers for this
lab was denied - 'we don't want any
have-a-go heroes.' In which case
why bother with them at all. I could
go on for several pages about
College safety policy, which is more
about eliminating liability than elim-
inating risk, but it would send all but
a few chemists and Sherfield bigwigs
to sleep. Suffice to say, it does not
work.
Finally, regular readers will have
wondered if I have gone cold on
Southside Bar. I have gone cold in it,
when the heating was on the blink,
but the beer remains at the usual
exceptional standard.
Recommendations here are fairly
pointless - every pint should be tried
(though not necessarily at once). If
you thought real ale was synony-
mous with amorous activities in a
canoe, then forsake Australian lager
for something a little creamier.
The Weekly Poem
(supplied by PoetIC)
All his nails were gone
he couldn't hang the picture
he couldn't eat the cracker,
he forgot his name.
He hid in the cloakroom
where he wandered for hours
with a clock as his sole companion
Oh, his personality was impossibly inflated
and with a bang!
he tiled the walls with his thoughts
his emotions, photographs of his life
but he could only focus on one.
The milk was overflowing
frothy and bubbly
Not like his days!
A range of different colours
were his banner
he wore for everyone to see
he hated fish but liked looking at their bones
he liked looking at the sea.
absorbing everything
or almost everything
deep and superficially empty
He admired the sea
cause he could understand it
and although he knew
he could become part of it forever if he wished
he wasn't exactly happy with the idea.
When he stopped dreaming
and we don't know when exactly this happened
he clasped his hands together and prayed
He dimmed the light and saw his eyes trembling
In a cartoon he once read
a page number was missing.
That was so clear.
It was perhaps more important
than the train he missed the other day
and even more useful.
