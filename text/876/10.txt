FRESHERS
The Freshers' Fair is your opportunity to
sound out any club you may be thinking
of joining.
Most clubs at IC will be showing off
their wares. For the location of a
particular club consult the index and
maps overleaf. Those clubs that are not
listed aren't coming and probably
wouldn't be worth joining anyway.
Please remember clubs cannot take
membership on the day. However, they
can sell goods from their stalls.
Do come along to the Union stall in the
Lounge as there should be at least a few
of the Union officers around and there
may even be a sabbatical (gosh, you
should be so lucky).
During the Freshers' Week, Union
officers will be recognisable by their blue
badges saying 'Imperial College Union'.
They have put themselves in the public
eye and you can therefore ask them any
questions you want, however you may
not always get the answer you were
looking for.
If you get bored with the event you can
always retire to the Union Bar which will
be open all afternoon.
