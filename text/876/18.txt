jU False Alarm Original
In issue 874 the story 'Asbestos Attack'
was factually incorrect as it stated that
Desmond Heatherington had been
diagnosed as suffering from Asbestosis.
The article should have said that
Mr. Heatherington had personally stated
that he had contracted the condition and
that no confirmation had been received
from his doctor at that time. We
apologise to his relatives for any distress
caused by the article and offer our
condolances for their loss.
Following the publication of that
Friday's edition. Dr Swan communicated
with FELIX and sent a statement
concerning Health and Safety at work.
Issued by Dr. Swan on behalf of Dr. R.
Gillon, Director of the Health Centre, it
reads:
"There has been a programme for
asbestos control in the college since 1980.
Where we know asbestos has been used
or where it is discovered during
maintenance or building work the
asbestos has been sealed to make it safe,
or if this is impractical, arrangements are
made for the asbestos to be safely
removed by specialist contractors. If
maintenance staff come across any
material in their work which they think
may pose an asbestos hazard they are
advised to report it to a designated
member of the surveying staff who
assesses the problem and arranges for the
asbestos to be sealed or removed as
appropriate before work commences.
We consider this programme adequate
to ensure members of college are not
placed at risk of asbestos related disease
and we are not aware of any member of
the college staff, either past or present,
who have been exposed to dangerous
amounts of asbestos in their work or
developed an illness as a result of
asbestos exposure. If this did happen we
would investigate it as a matter of
urgency to identify and advise others
who may have been at risk and to
prevent any further dangerous exposures
occurring."
Drama
During this year's Edinburgh Fringe, Neil
Motteram, an ex-student, put on one of
his school friends' plays, Leatherhead.
David Allen, the writer, also acted in the
play, a work that "incorporates original
poetry into a psychological drama." The
play was beset with troubles, including a
cast member walking out and numerous
script changes.
In a review entitled "Fringe cringe",
John Vidal of the Guardian described
Leatherhead as "the worst play on the
fringe".
A short extract:
B A R M A N : I see you're still following
your path of urban realism.
SUSIE: I take photos of the homeless and
then 1 go to bed.
FAN: I think she's got a point.
S t u d e n t L o a n s
You will probably be aware of the
student loan system due to its bad
publicity last year and the advertisements
appearing around London at the moment.
The Government has increased the grant
this year for the last time and is
introducing a loan in the Autumn term to
cover what should have been further
grant increases.
Any student receiving a mandatory
grant (college fees paid) can apply for a
loan. This loan will not be interest-free as
some of the banks are offering, but will
be index-linked.
Rather than hand out loans to every
student, the government has invented a
bureaucracy ridden application system in
an attempt to dissuade students from
obtaining a loan.
The first step in applying for a loan is
to visit the Registry to establish eligibility.
Student loans are being dealt with in
Room 345 on level 3 of the Sherfield
Building, opening hours are Monday,
Wednesday and Thursday 11.45am -
3.15pm
It is important to bring with you the
following items:
a) Students born in the United Kingdom
need a birth or adoption certificate.
Students born outside the United
Kingdom need a passport and a letter or
other document from a responsible
person - a minister of religion, doctor,
lawyer, teacher, established civil; servant,
police officer or consular officer - which
contains particulars of the
student's date, place and country
of birth and the student's names at birth.
b) A letter of advice from a local
education authority confirming a
mandatory award.
c) Evidence of a bank/building society
account, i.e. the production of a cheque
book, passbook or bank statement which
shows clearly the account number and
sort code.
Without these documents requests for
loans cannot be processed.
Once you have spent about ten minutes
filling in forms in the Registry you will be
given another form to fill in by yourself.
This must be sent by you to the Student
Loans Company.
If you receive a loan, what will you do
with it? If you pay income tax then a
good place to put it is in a Nationwide
Anglia Capital Bonus account. This is a
high interest account only allowing access
after three months notice. If you are a
non-taxpayer (i.e. your earnings total less
than £3005 pa) one of the best places to
put it is in a National Savings Investment
Account, obtainable at post offices.
The Investment Account requires one
month's notice for withdrawl. Unlike most
bank and building society accounts,
however, tax is not deducted at source
allowing non-taxpayers to benefit from
the high interest rate of 12.75% pa. This
means that nearly everybody at
university will benefit from taking a loan
and investing it in this way.
