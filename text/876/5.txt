the Union Snack Bar and menus were
replanned. The Salvation Army has
agreed to underwrite the losses as long as
the Refectories make every effort to sell
excess stock.
Problems were also envisaged with
transmitters set up on the roof of the
Physics department by Cellnet, the
portable telephone company. The deal
will bring in Â£25,000 a year for the
college, but the omni-directional aerials
on the roof will not be used unless
permission from the College is sought as
they caused interference with some
experiments in the department.
Directional aerials facing away from the
building will now be used.
A party organised by an ex-student was
cancelled after College Security banned
the event. The acid house style 'Daz'
party, planned for Saturday 15th
September, had been advertised outside
the College and this was considered likely
to have broken the rule that events held
in the Union Building are limited to
members of College or a formal guest list.
The bill for advertising handouts and staff
cards is to be met by College Security.
On a high note, two students, Charles
English and Philip Gribbon, set off on an
expedition to run the Karakoram
Highway from Islamabad in Pakistan to
Kashgar in Western China. The journey is
likely to take about four weeks and it is
believed that the journey has never been
attempted before in this manner.
