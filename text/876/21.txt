Some children are always putting their hands up to answer questions. But the teacher must be very careful to avoid the temptation to respond to the same ones all the time.
WHY SHOULD THE TEACHER
ASK THE CHILD ON THE RIGHT?
The teacher should never discourage the keen ones, of course.
But those like the boy on the right of our picture need attention
too. He may not have put his hand up for a number of reasons.
MAYBE he didn't put his hand up because he
. didn't hear the question. Or maybe he
didn't understand the way it was put. But he
may also be one of those children who are per-
sistently shy about answering questions, whether
they understand them or not.
Even if he knows the right answer, he may
be so worried about getting it wrong that he
just doesn't want to risk it. (This can be just as
true of a gifted child, by the way, as it can of a
slower one.)
In that case, the teacher must take the time
to help him build up his confidence. By asking a
simpler question, one the teacher is sure he
knows the answer to, perhaps. Or by giving the
child a choice of answers and reducing his
chances of getting it wrong.
Every child in the class has his or her own
unique difficulties and needs. As a teacher, you
must learn to recognise them and do your best
to help all your pupils realise their potential.
You have to be able to think on your feet, con-
tinually adapting your lesson in response to the
feedback you get from them.
That is why, even if you are teaching the
same material, no two lessons are ever the
same. And any teacher will tell you how satisfying
it is to see children develop not only in terms of
their knowledge and intellectual capabilities, but
also in their confidence as people. For that is
surely just as important as academic success to
help them get on in life.
