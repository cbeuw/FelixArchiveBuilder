Overseeing the social side of IC Union's
activities. Hence the rather cumbersome
annex to Honorary Secretary. I help with
the work of the Entertainments
Committee as necessary and the SCAB
(Social Cultural and Amusement Board)
societies. As 'Events' I organise the
Freshers' Fair, which is a pain to organise
but does net the Union quite a lot of
wonga, and the Commemoration Ball
staged for graduating students after they
have 'received' their Association
certificates during Commemoration Day.
This is why you have the afternoon of
October 25 off. There are also functions
throughout the year that I have to
organise such as the Bar Quizzes etc.
Due to the extensive use of rooms by the
functions I am also responsible for room
bookings, both for the clubs and the
'outside' bookings. So if you want a room
come and see me.
