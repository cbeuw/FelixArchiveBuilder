What the students say...
What w
e liked:
The sense of achievement when the pupils finally understood and could solve
the problems with a new vigour.
Contact with children with a fresh mind to subject areas.
Just working with children and seeing them learn something new.
That the pupils were really appreciative of the help given.
A new enjoyable experience; school, other teachers, tutors and children all
nice. Some fun for Wednesday afternoons.
Talking to pupils around their subject and helping them to experiment.
Being obviously useful in supervising practical work.
Knowing that the pupils liked me and that I'd done something useful.
What the pupils say...
I think the way the students went around doing different types of science
each week was very good. For instance one week we found out about
batteries the next about magnets, another about earthquakes.
I like the science students a lot; they helped us with our experiments and
writing and generally were very nice. I enjoyed having science lessons with
them.
What the teachers say...
What w
e liked:
Lessons were more enjoyable.
It gave me time to spend with pupils of my choice.
It was good for myself and the class to have outside ideas, different
backgrounds and ages.
We could decide beforehand who needed more help and use the tutor's time
in that way to give individuals extra attention.
I was able to let them talk and extend the more able pupils while I worked
with the rest.
The pupils valued them.
They are helpful, friendly and patient.
Very suitable for group work and provided fresh interest in the class.
They were good students who formed good relationships with the pupils.
