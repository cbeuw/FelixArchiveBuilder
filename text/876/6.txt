FRESHERS
B J P r e s e n t s
Freshers' Week '90 is the biggest and
undoubtedly the best Freshers' Week
undertaken in recent years. We have
three fun packed nights to introduce you
to the delights of social life at Imperial
College.
If you have ordered a ticket already
then you can pick it up in the Union SCR,
opposite from where the Union cards are
issued. Tickets cannot be collected on
Monday night—make sure you get them
before 5pm today. Please make sure you
have either a Union card or registration
slip with you on each of the nights—you
will need it to get into the gigs. We will
be selling tickets on each of the nights
but usually we sell out quite quickly so
arrive early or buy in advance from the
Union Office or Union SCR, today only.
So, you've paid your money—what do
you get?
Well, tonight we have bands, discos,
lots of alcohol, food and vast amounts of
fun at the New Year's Party. Appearing
live in the Lounge are two bands: The
Levellers and Ruff Ruff and Ready.
The Levellers are a Raggle Taggle rock
band in the same vein as the Men They
Couldn't Hang or the Pogues. Their
raunchy sound has been described by
NME as 'New Model Army meet The
Wonderstuff which is quite appropriate as
they have just secured a support slot on
the forthcoming New Model Army tour.
Ruff Ruff and Ready are a newish band
described (again by NME) as 'The Specials
meets The Clash' and the music comes
highly praised by many music papers:
very original band with a distinctive style,
with rave reviews for their first single
Tribal Mutation. They come to IC
fresh(ish) from a opening slot at the Stone
Roses Spike Island gig.
In the Concert Hall Ents are trying a
new idea. Amnesia '90—the rave is on.
As you may have guessed we are holding
a house music extravaganza (rave) with
some of the hottest DJs around, including
Evil Eddy Richards of Sunrise fame, MC
Rusty, Picci and Johnny. A very special
light and sound show is guaranteed to
keep you dancing 'til the early hours.
There will be other entertainment all
around the building, as well as food
available, a late bar until 2am and a
cocktail bar, but beware: too many
cocktails can seriously damage your
health. 1 can safely say (unless someone
accidentally delivers you a fatal blow to
the head) a better night's entertainment
will not exist anywhere else—no matter
how far you look.
Wednesday night is Comedy Night.
There are three excellent comdedians:
Pat Condel, a cheeky chappy; Doon,
make sure you don't miss this; and Simon
Day with a very special act. The evening
is compered by Jeff Green: make sure
you are there by 8.15pm at the
latest. If you have a week ticket
and you arrive later than 8.15pm

we cannot guarantee you entrance. After
the comedy there will be a disco until
lam with a late bar until midnight.
The final event of the week is the
Freshers' Ball. (It is called the Freshers'
Ball but try not to wear dinner jackets
etc—people will only laugh at you.) It is
very similar to tonight's event but with
some bands in the Concert Hall.
The main band, headlining the whole
week, is the excellent James Taylor
Quartet. With a string of LPs all with
excellent reviews, IC are lucky to have
this most famous of Acid Jazz' bands.
They have played at IC once before and
we had to turn away scores of people. In
my opinion the best act of the week.
They are no longer a quartet, now
including a full bass section and some
singers (including a rapper). The last
single was remixed by Jazzy B (of Sou/ //
Soul). Their sound inspired bands that are
getting big today, eg Charlatans, Inspiral
Carpets, but that classic hammond organ
sound, recently used with the
Wonderstuff on tour, still predominates.
Also on the bill are TTje Trudy. After an
impressive show here last year they are
back with their own brand of psychedelic
pop. Make sure you have your dancing
trousers on as they have a reputation that
they can make people who normally
wouldn't dance!
Downstairs in the Lounge we have
ff
WEEK
Death Bang Party and Boy Girl Soup.
Death Bang Party are the most
outrageous and energetic party band on
the circuit at the moment. They also
played here last year and the finale to
the show was very special indeed. A
band that needs to be seen to be
believed.
Boy Girl Soup will be releasing their
first single soon: newcomers to the scene,
but a very new and original sound. Check
them out.
Burgers, Cocktail Bar, late bar until
2am and a Disco will, of course, be
included in the event. There will also be
a free minibus service home for women.
The price of a week ticket for all three
events is £10. The Monday and Friday
Carnivals are £5 each and the Comedy
Night is £3.50, so obviously you can save
£3.50 if you buy a week ticket. Also the
events will probably sell out very quickly,
so to ensure entrance to all the events a
week ticket is your best bet.
After Freshers' Week, Ents is still very
busy. The next gig will be in the Lounge,
the first of regular Lounge gigs. Spirit of
Ecstasy and Miss American will both be
playing; they are in the Manchester ilk of
bands. Details will follow soon.
As well as this, every Wednesday in the
Lounge will be a free disco: somewhere
to let your hair down and get sweaty to a
few tunes.
All this entertainment can cost you
very little if you purchase an Ents card.
These cards are a mere £7 and give you
a discount on all the events; sometimes
you can even get in free. If you have
already ordered a card, then these can be
collected from the Ents stall at Freshers'
Fair.
If you would like to join the Ents
committee, it is very simple. Ents kids are
a group of students who put on events in
the Union. It is unpaid and it helps if you
are hardworking, but having said that it
is very rewarding. If you would like to
join up, it is free: simply chat to us at the
Freshers' Fair or talk to us at any of the
gigs. We are friendly and some of us are
interesting. Ents is undoubtedly the best
society at College.
Enjoy Freshers Week!
BJ, Ents Chair.
