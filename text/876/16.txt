The NUS tout for business in a non-affiliated students union
NUS Freebie
This year IC Union is providing new
students with a new, exciting and
environmentally friendly Student
Welcome Pack. FELIX got hold of one
before they were released a n d w e can
now reveal the exciting contents that are
packed into the trendy blue and white
plastic sack.
The Student Welcome Book claims to
have over S I 0 0 worth of money saving
offers, including money off such
wonderful items as Video Hire and
various Comet products. A potentially
prize winning questionnaire invites y o u to
criticise the pack whilst giving y o u the
opportunity to sign away your address to
junk-mail shots.
Perhaps more useful to a student, at
anywhere except IC, is the Health
Education 'Guide to a healthy sex life'. It's
full of useful advice, read it a n d find out
just what y o u are missing. A trial offer
for The Times is probably the most useful
part of the pack.
Hungry? T h e pack also contains
wholesome, healthy food. Well, a pot
hoodie, with a free 'build a pot sculpture'
competition. Follow this with a Toast
Topper, wash it all d o w n w i t h a can of
Citrus Spring, a n d finish off with an
italian packet of M & M s and a Milky Bar.
Worried all this will bring y o u out it
spots? Don't worry, the suppliers have
included a Biactol sample, and a shampoo
sample.
Sadly, what the pack doesn't include is
those items that a student would find
useful. There m a y be a guide to safe sex,
but where are the all too necessary
condoms? H o w are y o u supposed to
survive Freshers' Week without a supply
of Nurofen? Proplus would have been
handy too, for when y o u actually have to
go to a lecture.
I could ask w h y did they bother? but
then it is the only freebie y o u will receive
from ICU.
