Exploration Review: 1970-74
A C O P Y O F the Exploration
R e v i e w is a v a i l a b l e in the
L y o n P l a y f a i r Library. Since
the c o l l a p s e of the Exploration
Society the a c t i v i t i e s of the
Exploration Board have not
been well publicised throughout
the C o l l e g e . Unfortunately it
appears that few people outside
the s p e c i a l i s t c l u b s , such as
the Mountaineering C l u b , are
now aware of the e x i s t e n c e of
the Exploration Board.
The Exploration Board have
sponsored during the five
year period from 1970 to 1974
a total of twenty-two expeditions
to a l l parts of the w o r l d .
These may vary from botanical
and zoological expeditions to
the atolls of the Maldive
Islands, or a purely exploratory
and photographic expedition
to the Rift V a l l e y in E a s t
A f r i c a , to a c a v i n g expedition
to the Peruvian A n d e s . T h e
Exploration Board is a b l e to
give advice and financial
a s s i s t a n c e to groups of
Students from this C o l l e g e
who w ish to organise expeditions
whether exploratory or s c i e n t i f i c
to any part of the globe.
A p p l i c a t i o n s or enquries
for p o s s i b l e expeditions in
1976 should be made as soon
as p o s s i b l e to the Secretary of
the Exploration Board, M r . J F D
