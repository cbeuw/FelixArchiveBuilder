E l k i e Brooks - Rich Man's Woman (A&M)
Okie D.moks
THIS IS Ms Brooks' first solo album
and as part of her promotion tour, she is
doing a gig here at IC tomorrow evening
in the Great H a l l .
The album, which has a rather nice
picture of her on the front of the album
s l e e v e , is by no means one of the best
albums I've ever heard. F o r a debut L P
it is very s l i c k l y produced and you
e a s i l y get the quite correct impression
that Ms Brooks has been around for
sometime.
She used to front with a band c a l l e d
P a l l y when she first started in the
b u s i n e s s and then progressed to doing
recordings with the c r i t i c a l l y a c c l a i m e d
Vinegar J o e band who never did crack
the ice a s far as th.e record buying
public is concerned.
A n y w a y , to get on to her album. It's
not a fantastic album but i t ' s well
produced. The tune that really stands
out above a l l the others is ' H e ' s a
rebel' (a re-run of the old Gene Pitney
song 'She's a rebel').
Other tracks worthy of note are
'Where do we go from here (Rich man's
woman)' and ' J i g s a w baby' on s i d e one
and 'One step on the ladder' on side two.
with some good west c o a s t s e s s i o n
m u s i c i a n s a fairly good rock album has
been put out but one feels that Ms
Brooks may find herself in . a similar
position to Vinegar J o e if she doesn't
add a bit more bite to her next offering.

Utopia Limited :
a suitable case for reappraisal
The Times ranked it firmly above "The
Gondoliers" and claimed that
Gilbert and Sullivan had written
nothing so good since "The
Mikado".
The Daily Graphic suggested that some
of the speeches were the bitterest
satires ever written by WS Gilbert.
George Bernard Shaw was at the first
performance and wrote "..I enjoyed
the score of Utopia more than that
of any of the previous Savoy
Operas..."
The penultimate production of the great
Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration
" U t o p i a L i m i t e d " , presents something of
an enigma. Although fairly s u c c e s s f u l at
its first appearances it very rapidly
achieved an obscurity rival led only by
" T h e Grand D u k e " , the final G & S
production.
A s may be seen from the comments of
the press at the time, " U t o p i a L i m i t e d "
started life amid much acclaim from
public and c r i t i c s a l i k e . Although it did
no' b'aak anv of the records set by
•previous Savoy Operas, it opened on 7th
October 1893 and ran for 245 performances
The production was eagerly anticipated
by the London audiences and Richard
D'Oyly Carte lavished a mammoth £7,200
on the production, an amount unprecedented
in the history of Gilbert and Sullivan
operas; the audiences were not disappointed
with what they heard. When the show
finally c l o s e d it began a headlong rush
into obscurity. It received no professional
performances in this country until very
recently. It is not,and has not been, in
the repertoire of any professional opera
company, nor is it likely that it w i l l be
in the near future.
It is not easy to pin down the reason
for the lack of interest in this opera.
It has been suggested that its failure
could be due to the 'fact' that the old
flair of the partnership was waning
or that G i l b e r t ' s satire was too bitter
and aimed at too many targets at once.
Or it may just be that the expense of a
modem stage production and the necessity
of assembling a cast of stars capable of
doing justice to both words and music
militates against a full professional
r e v i v a l .
A l l the difficulties which present
themselves are e s s e n t i a l l y practical in
nature and are by no means insurmountable.
There is a great deal in this opera which
is worthy of note, Sullivan w a s fairly
fresh and prepared to put extra effort
into his light opera composing in view
of his recent s u c c e s s e s in the field of
more serious composition such as a
Royal Command Performance of his
oratorio . " T h e Golden L e g e n d " . During
the composition of " U t o p i a " he wrote his
Imperial March and conducted it at the
opening of the Imperial Institute, South
Kensington in 1893. Gilbert aims his
satirical darts at the Victorian world in
general in an all out attack on E n g l i s h
society, his particular targets include:
British business methods, the L a w , the
Parliamentary system, stage censorship,
the armed s e r v i c e s , the Victorian E n g d i s h
Lady and, most particularly, the E n g l i s h
nation's opinion of itself.
Whatever the difficulties involved, IC
Operatic society have decided that
" U t o p i a L i m i t e d " is well worth another
public airing and w i l l be performing it in
the Union Concert H a l l on 1 0 - 1 4 t h
February 1976. T i c k e t s A v a i l a b l e Shortly.
The Atlanta Rhythm Section — Dog
D a y s (Polydor)
T H E A T L A N T I C R H Y T H M S E C T I O N are
a bunch of Southern s e s s i o n musicians
who decided to emerge from the V U meters
and volume Faders to present the world
with yet another album of s e s s i o n music
and mediocrity, a sorry mistake.
A s you might well expect, they
boogie, 8-bar the blues to death, jam, get
down, " k i c k a s s " , and get it on with some
right funky country hoe-down. Who
doesn't these d a y s ? A n d a l l very commend-
ably professional. Professional to a
fault in fact, because the music has
been drained of the slightest originality,
no doubt of legacy of those countless
hours of bored takes and more bored
re-takes.
Some sparse pleasant moments appear
when the ballads come around, but the
whole thing is so unexceptional and
blatantly ordinary that s e s s i o n musicians
they are surely going to remain. T e c h n i c a l
proficiency w i l l see you through someone
e l s e ' s number most times but you need
real talent to write an orginal song,
and the one's on display here are about
as innovative as Coronation Street,
e n d l e s s ' rehashes of what has gone
before many times.
No, the prescence of this album in
the grand scheme of things m u s i c a l w i l l
not be burning fiery holes in many
pockets. "

(Charisma)
THIS IS A bit more like it. P e r s o n a l l y
I don't listen to much folk music, but
J a c k the lad are a different a n d interesting
band whose songs concentrate on the
working-class life around T y n e s i d e .
Three e x - L i n d i s f a r n e members, Si L o w e ,
Rod C l e m t s , and Ray L a i d l a w formed
Rod Clements, and Ray L a i d l a w formed
the band two years ago and " R o u g h
D i a m o n d s " is their third r e l e a s e . If you
appreciate the traditional branch of folk,
both in it's own right and within a more
modern musical setting la la Fairport
Convention or Steeleye Span) then J a c k
the L a d ' s reels, and folk-rock approxi-
mattoris should prove enjoyable.
The music is straightforward good-time
stuff; what you might hear coming from a
good country pub late at night once
sufficient ale has been sent on i t ' s way.
On the whole a reasonable album if you
partake now and then from the folk
barrel,. ^
