Disaffiliation: Mr Everett's statements misleading
Sir, — Admirable though it was
in its attempt to d i s c u s s the
issue of N U S membership,
Mr Dermot E v e r e t t ' s article
in F E L I X N o . 406 contained a
number of misleading statements.
Formost amongst these was the
statement 'Before Imperial
College last joined NUS It
boasted an admirable travel
service of it's own'.
T h i s may be true, but it
is very misleading to suggest
that an equally good travel
service could be set up almost
over night in the event o*
d'saf f i l i a t ' o n ; it would a l s o
require the s e r v i c e s of at l e a s t
one full-time administrator
whose salary etc would largely
counteract the s a v i n g of the
£4000 per annum which ICU
presently pays to N U S in
affiliat'on t e e s .
H i s second serious error
i s to state that the v o i c e of
4072 students at Imperial
C o l l e g e w i l l carry more
weight with the establishment
than t h e c o l l e c t i v e v o i c e of
771,258 students on such
matters as grants and education
p o l i c y . It i s true that the
p o l i t i c s of the leadership of
N U S are far divorced from
that of the grass-roots student,
but at l e a s t in educational
areas they do reflect the
opinions of the majority
of students.
He a l s o states that 'legal
and _Jinancial advice to
Student Unions' is provided
but omits to mention the Legal
A i d F u n d which s p e c i f i c a l l y
a s s i s t s students financially if
they have the misfortune to be
brought to court, in connection
with student a c t i v i t i e s . D o e s
he propose that an 'independant'
I C U does the same?
F i n a l l y , may I add that, in
my opinion, we should remain
members of N U S and by whatever
means at our d i s p o s a l try to
make N U S politically more
representative and as a first
step towards that goal to
press for the introduction of
direct elections to the N U S
executive.
Yours sincerely

Sir, — I was very distressed
to see such an inaccurate
biased view put forward by
M r Everett in his two articles
"The Question of Disaffiliation"
and "External Eclairs"
printed' in the last edition ot
F E L I X .
Why Mr Everett feels he is
an authority on the " p r o s " as
well as the " c o n s " of affilliation
is hard to s e e , e s p e c i a l l y when
virtually ail points listed are
" c o n s " . IC may have had its
own travel service before
Apathy a real problem
Sir, — May I take this opportunity
to make a few comments as
regards Ms G a d d ' s article
" A p a t h y or misdirected
s l o t h f u l n e s s " which appeared
>n the last i s s u e of F E L I X .
I find the whole l a i s s e z -
faire attitude of the article
somewhat surprising, e s p e c i a l l y
as the writer has been one of
the most vociferous campaigners
for change in certain areas
recently. Indeed, I am sure
that the whole argument w a s
more than a little tongue-in-
cheek.
F i r s t l y , we must accept the
political indifference of a
majority of our students. I am
not s a y i n g that we do not all
vote every now and again.
I think it l i k e l y that many of
us do.
However, p o l i t i c a l awareness
goes deeper than the five-year
rash known as a General
E l e c t i o n , and most students
do not appear to care whether
we, as an intelligent group of
people, have a c o n c e n s u s
view on many political i s s u e s ,
for example, i j c a t i o n c u t s ,
the situation in A n g o l a , e t c .
Whether you regard this a s
important is a different q u e s t i o n .
I personally find it disturbing
that a forum for debate for
such topics appears to attract
only a very small number of
students.
A s for her assertion that
" t h e average IC student has
wide and varied i n t e r e s t s " ,
I would like to know from
w h e n c e she draws her
s t a t i s t i c s . It is certainly so
much moonshine to point to
the C o l l e g e bars and trie
C C U s and to say " l o o k at aii
those s t u d e n t s " , because e
Ms Gadd knows, it is often
the same people who use the
bars and the C C U s .
It is difficult to guess how
many students use Union
c l u b s or the Sports Centre.
Whilst many do, I feel it is a
shade optimistic to suggest
that the situation cannot be
improved.
In c o n c l u s i o n , may I point
out that a Union Working
Party is currently investigating
just this f i e l d . Does the
Union have a problem? I
await any replies with interest.
Y o u r s s i n c e r e l y ,
J O H N DOWNS
Hon Sec ICU
we joined U S , bu' we would
not have one if we d i s a f f i l i i a t e d .
It w i l l take a long time to set
up such a service if it is
possible at a l l , which is very
doubtful in the economic
comate of today. Who would
run it, perhaps Mr Everett is
volunteering.
He a l s o c l a i m s we never
use the legal and financial
services provided by N U S .
T h i s is totally inaccurate.
Many times last year I
referred students to their
legal centre and rarely did a
week go by without me ringing
up N U S asking for some
advice on information on a
wide range of subjects. • E v e n
this year when representing the
Union on the Welfare group at
the U G C visitation in October
I obtained some very useful
information from N U S head-
quarters. I suggest that if
Mr Everett used their s o u r c e s ,
h i s information might be a
little more accurate.
It seems to me that the
option we have to take is the
one he did not include, namely,
to continue supporting the
p o l i c i e s with which we agree
and trying to change the ones
with which we do not agree;
to involve more " o r d i n a r y "
Students in N U S and not to
put them off the National
Union by distorting the truth,
and to encourage all students
to make use of the s e r v i c e s
offered to them, to
I agree that much of what is
d i s c u s s e d at N a t i o n a l
Conference seems irrelevant,
and much is irrelevant. H o w -
ever, every member of a
delegation can learn a great
deal about students, about
N U S and about debating
procedure (and even constitutional
wangles) by sitting through
such a conference. I think
even Mr Everett would agree
that it is impossible to
summerize a conference
lasting 3 days with more than
12 hours of d i s c u s s i o n each
day.
Although I did not attend
this conference, I would
be very surprised if there was
not d i s c u s s i o n on a lot of
relevant detail that were not
mentioned in the summary. If
no relevant matters were
d i s c u s s e d it is the fault of
each individual union, who
put forward the motions, and
decide which of the many
submitted motions should be
d i s c u s s e d .
I believe that Mr Everett
with his slogans and a l l , is
getting just as boring and
misleading as many members
of left-wing organisations.
