The Grants/Cuts Campaign
-a touch of realism needed
S O M E O N E , somewhere is
being s q u e e z e d . T h i s year, the
annual grants review, is press-
ing not only for a 33% increase
in grants, but a l s o for the
abolition of the means test,
discretionary awards, as well
as resisting a l l cut b a c k s in
education spending.
Simultaneously, the G o v e r n -
ment is urging local authorities
to pare their spending on
u n i v e r s i t i e s , p o l y t e c h n i c s ,
c o l l e g e s of education and s o
on down the line. How can
these two viewpoints be
reconciled? — They cannot.
The education system, if it
is to be cut, w i l l be cut at its
weakest and most vunerable
point. C o l l e g e s of Education
generally have no independent
funding and produce teachers,
the vast majority of whom w i l l
work in state s c h o o l s . The
number of teacher training
p l a c e s is to be cut from 114,000
to 60,000 by 1981. Fourteen
(14) C o l l e g e s of Education
are due to be c l o s e d or merged
with other institutions. The
cutback is most drastic in the
most e a s i l y r e g u l a t e d
professions.
In universities and poly-
technics the thrift erase w i l l
most likely c a u s e the closure
of under-subscribed c o u r s e s .
A s they are mainly s c i e n c e
and engineering c o u r s e s , this
could e a s i l y be a false
economy.
The N U S is obviously
opposed to cut-backs, but are
they likely to influence the
Government or anyone e l s e
by what appears to be an
hysterical reaction? Or are
they merely " A i m i n g for the
moon and hoping to hit E v e r e s t ' ' ,
to misquote Harold W i l s o n .
Statements made by the
N U S may seem "unrepresent-
a t i v e " to university students,
but the N U S has over 750,000
members of which only 263,242
are full-time university
students. It is hardly surprising
then, that the N U S reacts so
strongly to reductions in
spending in institutions other
than universities, as two-thirds
of Its membership come from
these same institutions.
However, though the
National Union should oppose
the removal of discretionary
grants and other p e n n y -
pinching measures, it seems to
be unrealistic to expect or
even hope to stop every single
budget in education. Surely'the
N U S would benefit its members
more by accepting that some
cuts have to be made, even
some colleges c l o s e d , and
advising the Department of
Education and Science which
could be c l o s e d with least
effect.
Taking an implacable stand
on a motorway is not a good
idea, some of the cuts may be
really damaging but blanket
opposition w i l l not pinpoint
them.
The demonstration on
February 27th will gain
publicity for the grants c l a i m ,
but reasoned d i s c u s s i o n s with
the D E S might prevent damaging
cuts. Y o u pays yer money and
you takes yer c h o i c e .
Jewish Society
So what does the IC J e w i s h
Society do?
It tries to concern itself
with all elements of J e w i s h
affairs which are of interest —
or what the committee of the
day thinks should be of
interest! — to J e w s and non-Jews
a l i k e .
T o further this aim we a l w a y s
have a s e r i e s of lectures, and
these are held on Tuesday or
Thursday lunchtimes so that
you, the average interested
and wide-awake student can
e a s i l y come along.
We have concerned ourselves
with aspects of the religion,
for example we had a lecture on
" E x o r c i s m and J u d a i s m " . "
We have been proud about how
far-flung the J e w i s h communities
are with a talk about the
J e w s in India, and we have
worried about the problem of the
importance of J e w s living in
or out of Israel, and the
threats to the continued
e x i s t e n c e of that country. We
have tired to illuminate
history by looking at the
British role in P a l e s t i n e , and
to reconsider history by
presenting a J e w i s h view of
J e s u s .
Most recently we focussed
our attentions on an o l d , but
only relatively recently
dramatised problem, namely
that of the survival of the
J e w i s h community in the
Soviet Union. We were fortunate
in being able to welcome as
speaker Alexander L e v i c h ,
son of Professor Benjamin
L e v i c h , member of the Soviet
Academy of S c i e n c e s .
Both had applied for exit
v i s a s to go to Israel more than
two years ago, and of course
immediately lost their means
of livelihood. Alexander
finally was allowed to come
to the West in April 1975,
but the K G B have retained
h i s father for an indefinite
period, despite promises to
the contrary.
We also have s o c i a l
gatherings of various iinds, so:
Do look out for our posters
(or become a member!) and of
course come along and listen
and argue.
You never know, you might
learn something. We might
learn something too.

N I N E T E E N D A Y S into the Sex Discrimination A c t and s o far
nothing has been heard from ICWA, I C ' s prima donna of s e x i s m .
No wind of revolutionary change has yet reached the F E L I X
office; it seems unlikely that the admission doors w i l l be flung
open to the hoards of young men valiantly knocking on I C W A ' s
door.
Seriously though, the A c t presents an opportunity to look at
the role of ICWA. Every woman student at IC is a member of
ICWA. The organisation welcomes freshers at the tea reception
on the first day of term and at freshers fair the day after.
It's annual Freshers Dinner a week later i s the best s o c i a l
event of the first three w e e k s . T h i s year their Halloween B a l l
was sorely m i s s e d , but the s u c c e s s f u l Christmas buffet partially
made up for it. T h e ICWA Easter B a l l completes their s o c i a l
functions. In the last year the Women In S c i e n c e and the Women
In A c t i o n G r o u p h a v e emerged from ICWA.
A test of any s o c i e t y s credibility is its'members' v i e w s . /
don't want to be in ICWA, is a strangely recurrent statement
coming from a disturbing proportion of IC women. ICU could do
without ICWA & ICWA's discriminatory are two more well conned
phrases. Certainly a s i z e a b l e chunk of IC women regard ICWA
as sexually d i v i s i v e ; a perpetual monument to the IC sex ratio.:
They 'eel it worsens attempts to overcome the ratio problem; in
short they view ICWA as an unnecessary s o c i a l luxury that IC
Union could well do without.
If ICWA is just a s o c i a l off shoot of ICU why does it need to
masquerade under a discriminatory image? After all the C C U ' s are
designed to be I C ' s s o c i a l unions.
However ICWA, or rather the IC Women In A c t i o n Group
(ICWIA), see the C C U s in a different light. H e r e ' s what they
have to say in an a r t i c l e , intended for publication in Sennet, a
copy of which turned up at the F E L I X office late last term.
Many of us at Imperial College are sickened by the childish
drunken, misgynist behaviour of the three constituent college
unions here. These unions actively work to perpetuate the female
hating, rugby playing, public school brand of hoolignism that is
rampant every evening. They produce weekly newsheets which
are regularly used to insult and abuse women both individually
and collectively — usually concluding that all women are morons.
Very adult indeed! Tnree more quotes from the same article
illustrate the picture of IC painted by ICWIA:
"Slavery for Women" badges abound-some worn by women.
