Ian Morse takes a look at some albums released over the holidays^
IT H A S O F T E N been s a i d that what
makes a good pop album i s an L P full
of potential hit s i n g l e s . E L O have
achieved just this with their new album
' F a c e T h e M u s i c ' (Jet R e c o r d s ) . After
the grandoise montage of c l a s s i c a l
snipbits that start the record the band
get down to the b u s i n e s s of making 'an
L P ' s worth of toons'. A s w e l l as the
obvious influence of the B e a t l e s (some
might s a y over-influence) Jeff L y n n e
draws h i s composing inspiration from
just about everyone that has come and
gone, a l l the melodies containing that
snatch of plagiarism that makes the
listener think ' C h r i s t now where have I
heard that before?' B u t then when you come
to think of it, such a connotation i s
irrelevant, as far as pop music goes.
A l l the songs are m e l o d i c a l l y very strong,
including the new single 'Evil Women',
each one produced to their full commercial
potential. T h e last E L O album showed
that at l a s t L y n n e was getting to grips
with h i s string s e c t i o n , and here too it
i s arranged to tasteful effect, not suffering
from the over indulgence heard on the
initial albums particularly the first under
the co-leadership of' R o y Wood' who as
it just s o happens has a new all-purpose
a l l - s o l o record on the market — 'Mustard'
(Jet records). Wood s t i l l seems to be
suffering from one form of indulgence or
another.
To be honest, I have no idea what
Wood i s trying to prove with this album,
and neither I s u s p e c t , does he. A s you
can imagine the man ends up p l a y i n g a l l
the instruments himself, a s o r t of orchest-
rated Don Partridge — as welf as singing
and producing the s o n g s . E v e r y p o s s i b l e
m u s i c a l instrument and style is crammed
onto the v i n y l , giving little breathing
space for a direct m u s i c a l form to manifest
itself. T h e overall effect conjures up
v i s i o n s of s a y , the Andrews Sisters and
Kenny B a l l in hectic combat with the
mass pipes of the Scots Guards! (Honest!)
Unly once does Wood allow a simple
melody to progress gradually, ironically
the p i e c e is c a l l e d 'The Song!
Unfortunately, one out of nine does not
make a good album.
From the opening few bars of 'Spirit
Of T h e B o o g i e ' - (Polydor) by K o o l and
the Gang, you grasp immediately that
K o o l ' s street-funk is aimed more at the
body rather than the brain. A predictable
funk rhythm started up by the drummer i s
followed by the equally predictable husky
spade v o i c e telling everyone to 'Get on
up" y a ' l F and ' G i t it on — e h ! ' But why
not? T h e m u s i c is only for dancing to
(isn't it?) and as such its just fine.
S o l i d rhythm's l a i d down with very little
thought given to melody and even l e s s
to l y r i c s — in fact the only time the
band come unstuck i s when they try to
vary the pace with slower material, w h i c h
turns out to be a l e s s o n in almost total
c r a s s n e s s talking of which brings me
to the latest release by those Twee T w i n s
Graham N a s h and D a v i d C r o s b y , who have
got together with peace and tranquility to
produce 'Wind On T h e Water' (Polydor).
But to be fair this record contains l e s s of
the embarrasing sentimentalities of N a s h
or the absurdities of C r o s b y ' s previous
work (for instance, Simple Man and
Almost C u t My H a i r r e s p e c t i v e l y ) . T h e
music i s strong with creditable p l a y i n g
from everyone concerned, the string
arrangements two are generally w e l l
conceived and are employed sparingly
throughout. L y r i c a l l y I must admit I've
never rated N a s h noT C r o s b y . H a v e they
ever said anything? T h e same goes for
this album. Try a s I h a v e , to me they
remain confused ramblings.
However, superficially pleasant this
album i s , the fact remains that the
reputation of C r o s b y and N a s h i s built
largely upon their past work wit h greater
mortals that is S t i l l s and to a greater
extent Y o u n g . F o r me they have yet to
justify their m i l l i o n dollar earnings with an
a r t i s t i c a l l y viable record. T h e same cannot
be s a i d of John C a l e , who has received
widespread c r i t i c a l a c c l a i m for much of
his past work, but who's new album
' H e l e n of Troy (Island) leaves much to be
desired.
Rumour has it that this album c o n s i s t s
mostly of previously rejected material
that has been re-vamped by the artist,
After listening to it, I haVe no reason to
doubt this, the majority of songs being
substandard C o i e offerings. T h e lack of
consistantcy does not only apply to the
songs, but a l s o to the overall feel of the
album. F o r instance, many of the tunes
have lush string arrangements, 'China
Sea' is sung in such a w h i m s i c a l fashion,
it would not be out of place on a K e v i n
A y r e s ' album. Coupled with these we
have 'Cable Hogue' and Leaving it up
to you', which judging by the neurotic
rendition given to them by C a l e , can only
be described as straight-jacket rock.
Only a few of the numbers are anywhere
near C a l e s ' past work, the best being
the opening cut 'My Maria , which features
the fine guitar work of C h r i s Speeding.
T h e rest are barely adequate. N o way i s
this record up to the high quality of
work previously a s s o c i a t e d with John
C a l e .
I suppose it i s inevitable that anyone
who chooses to c a l l their album ' K i n g
B r i l l i a n t as Howard Werth has done, takes
the risk of running the c r i t i c a l gauntlet.
L e t me be no exception. One of the main
faults with this record i s what seems
superficially to be a good move on
Werth's part — getting one of r o c k ' s top
producers (Gus Dudgeon) to handle h i s
work. Whilst h i s theories on production
may run synonimously with the bland
songs of E l t o n John, I find h i s c l i n i c a l
over production totally a l i e n to Werth's
style of writing. Much of the record is
covered in needless orchestration making
potentially good straight forward songs
sound decidedly fay. On the whole
king average.
Over production could hardly apply
to the new record by West C o a s t stalwarts
Hot T u n a . Judging by Y e l l o w F e v e r
(Grunt Records), the band seem to be in a
sort of late sixties time-warp, totally
indifferent towards what has happened
to music in the last six years. B o o g i e
still seems to be the message with this
heavy-mental trio who turn the amps up
to maximum volume and proceed to crash
their way through instantly forgettable
songs that guitarist . Jorma Kaukonen
probably thought up the previous night.
I have little e l s e to say of it except no
B r i t i s h band would smell a recording
contract playing this stuff today.
Which brings me lastly and least to the
Nancy N e v i n s Album (Tom C a t records).
Who, you may a s k , is N a n c y N e v i n s ?
B e l i e v e me it's not worth your bother to
find out. I was presented with this album
for purpose of review several weeks ago,
but s t i l l cannot make any c r i t i c i s m of it —
be it constructive or otherwise. Apart
from saying that she sings like a nightclub
lush, writes all her own songs (which
sound remarkably like imitations of just
about every-female style from Peggy
L e e to C a r o l K i n g , I am at a total l o s s
for words.
