Missed opportunities
Imperial College A ' s 14
T H I S F I R S T G A M E of the
year came to life in the second
half, in which there were
six " t r i e s , and which ended
with a well-deserved victory
for the money men.
F i r s t blood was to the Bank
when they kicked a penalty
after an A ' s player was offside.
The A ' s reply was' not long
d e l a y e d . The ball was won on
the left and passed right down
the b a c k s . Lynne D a v i e s , on
the w i n g , was caught, but
passed back inside to C h r i s
Becque who put Bob L e e s o n
over for an excellent try.
Complacency then set in, but
not for long. Bank scored a
try from a penalty almost on
the A ' s line. The score at
half time w a s 4—9 to B a n k .
T h e A ' s were looking
forward to playing with the
wind but a swift try from
the Bank damped down the
enthusiasm with which the
A ' s opened the second half.
P u l l i n g themselves together
the A ' s moved into their best
period of the game. From a
scrum fifteen yards out R i c h
Jenner broke away and fed
George Sweatman who s c o r e d .
D i c k P u l l e n was unlucky
with the conversion, the ball
hitting the post. He made

C O M P U T E R A N A L Y S I S dictated
that the E x t r a s ' play with no
wings due to a shortage of
players. So Middlesex rejoiced
but remained conventional.
Through good defense
and attack we held our own
for the first and pointless,
half hour. Eventually the
E x t r a s took the lead for a
penalty but Middlesex soon
'replied with a try to make the
score at half-time, 3—4.
Though having the wind
behind them in the second half
IC took twenty minutes to get
out of their own half. A fine
run after a good clearance
from Bob Stern enabled Steve
to bulldoze through three
players to score a try; his
first for two years. Then
scrum-half Simon Whaley made
a blind side break and carried
another three players over
the line for a try. Some fine
play then followed involving
Gerry Molloy and Steve J e n k i n s
which enabled Mike G i b s o n to
sprint away and score beneath
the posts to c l i n c h the match.

a penalty, making the A ' s
nine points adrift but s t i l l in
the game. Then Bank scored
their last try and clinched
the game. T h a A ' s did not
give up and for the last ten
minutes Bank were kept under
considerable pressure. Gyn
D a v i e s was unlucky not to
score at- that time. H e was
brought down only three yards
short of the line having run
half the length of the f i e l d .
It was a good game with
which to open 1976. There
were missed opportunities but
nevertheless the A ' s gave a
good performance.
Thank you, Martin Cotter,
for refereeing. You did such
a good job that the lynching
has been postphoned for a
week.

ORIENTEERING
Flat grounds
favours IC
L A S T S U N D A Y witnessed
Imperial C o l l e g e s greatest
entry to date into the realms
of Orienteering. T w e l v e brave
and intrepid runners descended
upon Ranmore Common deter-
mined to give their a l l , and
complete their respective
courses before c l o s i n g time.
The forest itself was ve'ry
runable and fairly flat, giving
hope to those 'runners' amongst
us. Indeed the ' A ' course of
6.8km was completed in 42
minutes by our d a z z l i n g
Captain Dave Rosen, three
minutes clear of h i s nearest
r i v a l , to give him a d e c i s i v e
victory. Somewhat further down
the field came A l a n Leakey
in 60 minutes, followed by a
wave of C r o s s Country C l u b
e x i l e s , Ron A l l i n s o n , Steve
Webb, Mike Welford, and many
more.
Meanwhile, back on the ' B '
course several newcomers to
the sport were learning about
Orienteering using the trial
and error method. Keith
Sugden w a s the first Imperial
runner home, in 90 minutes.
FOOTBALL
Grimwade
returns
triumphant
IC 1st XI 1
L A S T S A T U R D A Y saw IC
1st XI play their Annual
fixture against Corinthian
C a s u a l s . T h e IC midfield w a s
superb in this game, making
a mockery of the conditions
afid at times their opponents.
Grimwade, looking every inch
the talented young Star we
know him to be, made this a
triumphant return to 1st c l a s s
football (After falling foul to
Dirty Pat Frampton early last
term).
For long stretches of the
game he directed play in the
middle of the park, combining
well with Singleton and the
Horny Welshman Roberts. Some
neat inter-changes in midfield
led to several penetrating raids
in the 1st half. U p front, Steve
Gee was as e l u s i v e a s ever
and Lindon, using the murk as
a camouflage surprised h i s
opponents on a number of
occasions but didn't surprise
his team mates when he
failed to score.
N i l each at half time and
the C a s u a l s with the wind at
their backs pressed hard for a
goal. The IC defence however
Corinthian C a s u a l s 1
was not to be pierced for a long
time into the half. Gentleman
J i m I ley, " t h e big bearded
bastard at the back defended
solidly and Dooley and Howley
were both constructive. The
goal w a s eventually conceded
when our makeshift defender
(formerly a myopic midfield
schemer) let the ball through
h i s legs for the centre forward
to hip in for an easy one.
IC did not have to wait!
long for an equaliser. I ley,
s a l l y i n g forth from defence, a
sight rarely seen these days*
laid a mouthwatering ball to
winger dirty Terry. Terry,
s w i v e l l i n g around, flighted a
wicked c r o s s to the far post
for Steve G e e to nod down into
the path of Grimwade who made
short work of putting it into
the net. One each and they
don't come much better than
that.
With just five minutes left
the c a s u a l s fought hard for a
winner but didn't get it thanks
mainly to K e v A l l e n in goal
{hands like fly paper).
/ A good result for IC and
surely a game to remember.

The match started very

five minutes Martin Smeaton

of the match. Shortly after
that he scored another and

third. But although the defence

T h e second quarter was a

attack. In particular two of
our recruits, Pete Watson and
Richard Forster, fought hard
for p o s s e s s i o n but failed to
score. Meanwhile the Kenton

the pressure. E v e n though
