N U S Policy Conference
Fight on
all fronts
urged
A R E P O R T on the National Conference
at Scarborough in one of the national
newspapers began, " G o i n g to, an N U S
Conference is like going to the theatre —
you leave a l l reality b e h i n d " . I was
trying to shrug off this preconception
last Wednesday as I queued for registration,
when suddenly a fat, bearded, s o c i a l i s t ,
white rabbit came running past with
shouts of " O h my w h i s k e r s , I'm l a t e " .
The rabbit then disappeared into the
bar towing a heavy length of broad left
line behind him. After such a start, I
wondered what the rest of the conference
might hold in store.
The conference was opened by the
N U S ' s enamoured president, C h a r l e s
C l a r k e , who spoke mostly on the subject
of E d u c a t i o n C u t s and urged for a united
front of all students and unions against
these cuts — and informed us that the
U n i v e r s i t i e s ' sector of the N U S must be
central to a l l fights (perhaps because
we put in the mostmoney). H e finally
urged us to continue the fight on all
fronts against the economic p o l i c i e s of
this right wing Labour government.
(It is worth poining out here that, in
Student p o l i t i c s , anyone further left
than the Tribune group i s considered
left wing and are s a i d to belong to the
Broad Left — a somewhat nebulous title.)
The U n i v e r s i t i e s conference has no
power to make p o l i c y on matters not
directly concerning u n i v e r s i t i e s and
this naturally led to an argument over
the agenda. Of the five plenary s e s s i o n s
arranged, only two were of direct concern
to u n i v e r s i t i e s . The first of these was on
the Education C u t s .
The future?
IN T H E N E A R future you may a l l be asked
to decide whether or not to stay in the
N U S . T h i s is a very serious d e c i s i o n ,
and, w h i l e it may not a l w a y s seem s o , I
would not be in favour of our withdrawing.
I would agree that, at the moment, the
N U S is too involved in international
affairs (where it suceeds only in
showing its impotence). While, on the
subject of Northern Ireland, and the
problems of students at home, where N U S
has real power, it remains relatively
inert. The only way to change this
state of affairs is to look beyond the ends
of your pens for once; not a s far as
C h i l e , maybe, but just far enough to see
your own Students U n i o n . G i v e more
thought to the election of your repre-
sentatives at conference and to the
election of officers. T h e strength of
representative democracy lies in the'
thoughts of the active reflecting the
thoughts of the majority. If the majority
is apathetic, it can never work.
PGs-time to take
your head out
of the teapot.
T H E DISCUSSION group on Postgraduates
centred around the problem found through-
out the country by most student unions:
that of contacting P G ' s and getting them
to participate in the union. T h e converse
is how to find ways of making the unions
more responsive to the needs of post-
graduates.
The initiative in these matters must
come from the union. B e c a u s e of the
nature of their work, P G ' s do not use
any communial areas to the same extent
that undergraduates do. Consequently, it
is difficult to notify them of events and
meetings. T o the majority of post-grads,
the unions seem very U G orientated,
e s p e c i a l l y s i n c e they are a c t i v e for
only 30 weeks of the year. A t Southampton,
a scheme to integrate post grads into the
union by providing films, d i s c o s , etc
during the U G v a c s proved most s u c c e s s f u l .
The events, organised in the main by
P G s already active in the union, received
an excellent response. I feel that this
might be equally s u c c e s s f u l at IC,
e s p e c i a l l y s i n c e many U G s stay up
during the vacs now.
The best way to promote a P G
organisation is at the departmental
level, which most suits the P G course.
Departmental groups, each sending
representatives to a central committee
is a system proved s u c c e s s f u l in many
U n i v e r s i t i e s . There was some d i s c u s s i o n
on the P G Education reports, recently
released, and the N U S P G advisory
group is to look into them further.
P G s should consider the reports and
voice their opinions to the bodies
concerned. The situation between trades
unions and Postgraduates is changing;
in the past, A S T U S has been regarded as
the only union which represents P G s ,
e s p e c i a l l y with respect to demonstration
rates, w h i c h have a direct bearing on
A S T U S agreements for their won staff -
members. The A U T , long looked upon as
elitist organisation of higher academics,
awaits the result of a members ballot to
decide whether or not they w i l l apply
for membership of the T U C . Both
organisations have a postgraduate c l a s s
of membership, the A U T open only to those
P G s directly involved in teaching. There
are definite advantages to be gained
from membership of one of these unions,
but it would be unfortunate if a result
of having two unions recruiting members
was a split amongst P G s , worse s t i l l if
it severed them from their Student U n i o n .
It is very important that Student Unions
and their P G s get together and sort out
their differences. In the future, they
should be able to work together, and
P G s should be able to make full u s e of
the Union f a c i l i t i e s (it w a s suggested,
that if these f a c i l i t i e s were offered for
52, not just 30, weeks a year, the Union
might have a c a s e for a s k i n g a higher
capitation fee).
If you would like help or a d v i c e on
how to set up a postgraduate group in
your own department, or have any ideas
on how the union might be more responsive
to P G s , please contact myself, or any
members of the exec.
Just going
through the
motions
Many of the motions passed at the
conference went through uneventfully.
The IC delegation put through an
emergency motion c a l l i n g for the release
of a 17—page d o s s i e r supposed to
contain the truth on the state of the
world which the N U S has penned its name
to on behalf of a l l B r i t i s h students. T h e
motion w a s overwhelmingly c a r r i e d .
A motion fees c a l l e d for the reduction
of a l l fees — it is unfair and unreasonable
to put the cost of education of L E A ' s
rather than finding it centrally from the
Government. It .penalises those students
forced to finance t h e m s e l v e s . T h e
abolition of the differential between home
and overseas students fees was a l s o
c a l l e d for.
Others motions passed included those
on sport, catering and postgraduates
(table by IC). O n sport, a b o l i t i o n of the
binary system was the main point, but
the need for severe changes in the
assessment systems and a thorough
investigation of present competitive
assessments as to their v i a b i l i t y and
-reliability.
The motion on catering was only
passed after sections of it concerning
maintenance of the U G C self balancing
rules were removed. Our ewn belief
is that a fair grant is the only real
solution and that s u b s i d i s i n g s e l e c t
sectors of the student body is both
unrealistic and unfair.
The matter of representation was a l s o
d i s c u s s e d and the E x e c u t i v e are to
press the C V C P for greater representation,
e s p e c i a l l y at departmental l e v e l s on
course boards, teaching committees, e t c .
Our own motion on P G s had minor
amendments put to it on its passage. It
was the view of the conference that
the P G grant should be maintained at
52/30ths of the U G grant.

T H E T R O O P S O U T C A M P A I G N were
severely c r i t i c i s e d during the s e s s i o n
on. Northern Ireland for advocating a
solution 'that would inevitably end in a
blood bath. The B r i t i s h Government did
not escape unscathed.
Westminster was a t t a c k e d for
" s h r o u d i n g its Northern Ireland bloodied

to portest to the United N a t i o n s about
atrocities in C h i l e while committing
similar atrocities itself in Northern
Ireland.
