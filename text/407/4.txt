E N T S H O P S were resurrected with a bang last F r i d a y night
when the 101'ers performed in the Union Concert H a l l . T h e
group performed many o l d R o c k ' n ' R o l l standards and were
well received by the large audience.
Universities Conference
I spent most of last week
in D u r h a m at the N U S
U n i v e r s i t i e s P o l i c y Conference.
One of these conferences is
held each year for every s e c t o r
of N U S , a n d they are empowered
to make national policy on
matters which are the direct
and e x c l u s i v e cerhcern of
that sector. Knowing t h i s , I
was surprised to s e e that the
agenda for the conference
contained very few items that
could be considered a s the
direct and exclusive* concern of
the U n i v e r s i t i e s .
We d i d , however, have some
very interesting s e s s i o n s
particularly those on Northern
Ireland and Southern A f r i c a . T h e
general feel ingof theconference
was that the B r i t i s h Government
were adopting the wrong
t a c t i c s in Northern Ireland
and a l s o denying their respon-
s i b i l i t y for t h e present
situation.
A more detailed report
should appear elsewhere in
this illustrious p u b l i c a t i o n .
Apathy in IC
The article by Karen Gadd
in the last i s s u e of F E L I X
w a s , I am sure, read with
interest throughout the C o l l e g e .
I found her point of v i e w
interesting, though 1 do not feel
I c a n totally agree with it.
I w i s h I c o u l d .
The article g i v e s the
impression that everyone in
IC i s busily involved in a wide
range of extra-curricula
a c t i v i t i e s . My experience is
that we s t i l l have a large
number of "brown b a g g e r s "
in IC who are only interested
in their work and take no part
in other a c t i v i t i e s at a l l .
Disaffiliation
Derrick Everett put points
for a n d against membership
of N U S in the last issue of
F E L I X at some length. N o
one can deny that N U S is a
political body and if y o u
want to be part of a political
body then we must stay i n .
Whether we want a different
political balance or not is
a relatively minor point. If
you do not want to be members
of a political body then either
leave it, or alter it. Y o u must
remember though, that to alter
a political body, to make it
non-political, we w i l l have to
become political o u r s e l v e s .
I hope to s e e lively debates
on this subject in the near
future and I feel it would be
helpful to invite C h a r l e s
C l a r k e , N U S President, and
Ian M i n n i s , President of Aston
University, to IC to debate the
question.
i await comments on Derricks
article with anticipation.
