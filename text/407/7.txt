Comments and observations on the conference by Rick Parker
a forceful speech d e t a i l i n g the history of
Northern Ireland at the hands of the-
B r i t i s h Government. She c a l l e d for the
introduction of a B i l l of Rights in
Northern Ireland a s a first step towards
a solution. T h e N U S was a s k e d to flex
its p o l i t i c a l m u s c l e s nearer home, " i t
i s time students (Dut their own house in
o r d e r " . T h e absolute s i l e n c e at the
end of the speech pointed to the generally
acknowledged fact that the question of
Northern Ireland w a s an embarassing
one which students and indeed most
Britons fought shy of. The atrocities being
committed were only being paid l i p service
to — a change of attitude was required.
T h e third s e s s i o n on ' T r a d e U n i o n s
and the E d u c a t i o n C u t s ' , w a s lead by
J i m Mi line, Secretary to the Scottish
T U C w a s most disappointing. We were
urged once again to fight the Tory p o l i c i e s
of this Labour Government otherwise it
was a gross overstatement of the obvious
and ended with assurances that bridges
were being built between the unions and
students (one wonders if the traffic
w i l l be two-way).
T h e International s e s s i o n w a s
apart from i t s relative irrelevance to the
u n i v e r s i t i e s sector, superbly uninformative.
The major part of it was devoted to the
history of the Anti-Apartheid Movement
(AAM) in and outside South A f r i c a . T h i s
w a s followed by a rundown on the other
international campaigns and the numbers
of telegraphs of sympathy/support sent,
without comment on the total impotence of
such campaigns nor the disinterest of
90% of the student population in such
campaigns.
Lecturer
training-
IC brings
up the rear
T H E M A I N value of this conference was
in the d i s c u s s i o n groups. T h e group on
" E d u c a t i o n and A l t e r n a t i v e s " provided
c o n s i d e r a b l e information on the S C A N U S
(Student ""Community A c t i o n and Environ-
ment Unit—NUS) and Counter Course
projects.
Both of these, although, relatively
new, have already began to investigate
the alternatives in education. A s a result,
various w i d e ranging courses have been
considered and this year Cambridge h a s
begun a course on women's s t u d i e s .
Counter C o u r s e provides alternative
reading lists for some subjects with
aspirations of extending this f a c i l i t y . It
is a l s o c o n s i d e r i n g alternative assessment
and the setting-up of e s s a y / p r o j e c t
banks within u n i v e r s i t i e s .
T h e e s s a y / p r o j e c t bankidea involves
the storage of e s s a y s and projects for
reference by future students engaged in
s i m i l a r work. It recognises the fact that
each year a great deal of original thought
and effort i s put into project and essay
work. T h i s work is usually last to
following generations of students.
T h e lecturer training group provided a
great deal of information o n the subject.
T h i s i s an area in which the greater
part of our own college i s sadly lacking.
It seems loath to recognise the need for
formal training of lecturers and yet s o
often courses have been deemed bad due
to poor lecturing and exam failure in a
particular part of a course blamed on
badly delivered lectures.
T h i s area is one in which IC i s well
behind others in the country, Surrey and
UMIST to name but two.
Demonstration of
international
impotence
S U E S L I P M A N ( N U S N a t i o n a l
Secretary with little responsibility
remaining) led the plenary s e s s i o n on
Education C u t s . T h e s e s s i o n lack any
positive direction and suffered because
of the time allocated it — only 45 minutes.
The usual c a l l s for a united struggle
to oppose the cuts were made but no
real a d v i c e or suggestions were put
forward a s t o how a C O C constituent
organisation), might surviva- during their
implementation.
The cornerstone of this y e a r ' s
anti-cuts campaign i s the national
demonstration on February 27th which I
urge you all to attend.
In the second plenary s e s s i o n , the
question of representation, at a l l levels
in a university, w a s d i s c u s s e d . Student
participation at a l l levels in d e c i s i o n s
about their education w a s the firm line
adopted. A major point that emerged from
this was that participation at departmental
level in helping to construct c o u r s e s and
to evaluate assesment techniques w a s
useful to all concerned.
There were however, s e c t i o n s of the
conference, w h o w i s h e d to e x e r c i s e
absolute veto on committee d e c i s i o n s
without having been involved in the
d e c i s i o n making p r o c e s s . T h e idea behind
this being that they would avoid compromise
situations.
