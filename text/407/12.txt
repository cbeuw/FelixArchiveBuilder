(11th), expecting to b e beaten
by a large margin. However,
the opposition proved to b e
no match for the G H c h a u v i n i s t

match n * \ to 4, where n+1
i s large (like A n g i e ) . T h i s ,
despite the ref p l a y i n g for
the other s i d e , and enforcing
an imaginary time wasting rule.
(What a f i d d l e , w e thought.)
T h e obvious h e r o / h e r o i n e
was K i l l e r R o n (what a star)
who scored most of the p o i n t s ,
though every other p l a y e r made
h i s mark, i n one way or another.
T h e spectators were reinforced

night...!!!) b y the sub-warden,

Titbits
Contempt for women is constantly whipped up and maintained
at the level of a high pitched giggle.
They (men) approach women in groups of three or more and
start conversations with phrases like "As a male chauvinist pig..."
In fairness to ICWIA their- article came a week after the
unfortunate rape of a girl at I C . E v e n after this event the group
regard the attitude 'of c o l l e g e at large a s indifferent'. They are
further dismayed by IC Union C o u n c i l where' the i s s u e w a s
d i s m i s s e d as regretable but relatively unimportant.'
The authors of Titbits hope that opinions of ICWIA group are
not typical of women at I C . In c l o s i n g we would like to draw
some, c o n c l u s i o n s and pose some quest i ons. F i r s t l y , I C W A ' s
continued e x i s t e n c e depends on their ability to expand outside
that ICWA organise are well done; nobody wants to s e e them
disappear. Y e t they could be run just as effectively by the I C U
E x e c u t i v e or C a r n i v a l Committee a s by ICWA.
We are prone to ask: Is the attitude of IC men towards women
abnoxious or i s IC just biased against women?
Either way we feel c a u s e to echo the words of a candidate
for the ICWA P r e s i d e n c y , " I C W A needs a k i c k in the pants".
Too True!
