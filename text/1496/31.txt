Horoscopes
...but this t-shirt has never got me laid
Edgy as fuck. What’s he going to do next, smoke a
cigarette?
MUM! I DID IT!
“I fingered a girl once - it was messy. But don’t worry,
I now take precautions. My sleeves will be fine.”
Mingle? With humans? I think I’d rather mingle with
my own kind - Blood Elves of the Azranthian shores
I don’t know why girls kept talking about cup size,
but I hope I got it right
Our Freshers’ Week was pure carnage. At one point
a guy put a shot on my head!
All the female freshers of 2011 pose for a photo

Scorpio
You die from a nut allergy...
...your last flashes of life being some
white sticky fluid flying up your nostrils.
Aries
You’ve moved into halls, only to find
that your floor consists entirely of US
Navy SEALS.You hope they’ve brought
some of that top porn they pinched from
Bin Laden’s pad. And no one is going to
now fucking mess with your food in the
kitchen fridge, too right.
Taurus
Imperial satisfaction keeps going
down and we’re now below Lancaster
in the league tables. Maybe if the
Union got its act together (after 100
years of crap) and girls had bigger tits
this shit wouldn’t happen. Sort. It. Out.
Jesus...
Gemini
Everyone is talking about a double dip
recession. All you can think of is em-
ploying some quantitative easing and
a triple dip of two in the pink and one
in the stink to make your missus happy.
It’s what Robert Peston wouuulllddd
waaaannnntt.
Cancer*

You die from PC (ironic, eh?). The world
mourns the loss of a great innovator,
but, come on, what was the point of the
iPad? Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?
I have a laptop that does more for less.
YOU TURTLENECK WEARING
FUCKWIT!!
Leo
After failing to get laid at the Mingle, you
go back to halls deflated. Amongst the
freebies in your room, you see some Ir-
resistibly Smooth Body Nivea® Lotion,
promising a 24hr silky skin feeling, and 1
condom. You’re on a student budget - you
grab the chance for a free posh wank.
Virgo
Your roommate has a nut allergy. You’re
curious - you liquify a pack of pista-
chios and inject them into his little toe
as he softly sleeps. He starts frothing at
the mouth, shaking violently. You look
furtively around. You lock the door. You
have an aggressive wank.
Libra
You corner the only hot fresher in your
year outside the lecture theatre. After
failing miserably with the Felix chat-up
lines from last week’s issue, you ask:
“What’s the difference between jam and
marmalade?” You then shove your willy
up her arse. Oh the poetry of it all.
Sagittarius
For your weekly horoscope, call
0800-really expensive premium rate
number-800-800 from 6am GMT each
Friday. All proceeds will go towards
funding the editors penchant for cocaine
fuelled Nazi orgies in the back of the
Felix office. Much appreciated xxx
Capricorn
Oh dear, it’s Freshers’ Week and you
never realised what a cum-bucket you
were. You’ve shagged your new mates
and then some. In a moment of nihilistic
angst, you question the meaning of life
before going to your room to slowly
ram those fingers up your minge. Awful.
Aquarius
You dingleberry. You keep bragging
about your summer internship at one of
those cock-sucking banks. Some rugby
boys, out of cash and over-sexed, hear
of your £40,000 reward for shafting
their mum’s pension. They punch
you in the face. That’s karma, that is.
Pisces
If you’re actually reading this, it sug-
gests you believe this crap and go
around proclaiming “I’m not reglious,
just spiritual.” You deserve a flying el-
bow to your ovaries. If you’re looking
for self-healing, you’d be better off buy-
ing a pack of plasters.
