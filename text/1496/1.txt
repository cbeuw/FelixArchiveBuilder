Imperial College Business School is
welcoming its first students of a new
Masters programme and providing them
with a free iPad 2 with which to carry
out their studies. The programme lead-
ers of the MSc in Strategic Marketing
are scrapping the traditional paper-based
learning and teaching methods and pio-
neering a novel approach centred on the
use of digital and social media.
At the start of each lecture, QR (Quick
Response) codes will be used, allowing
students to download the PowerPoint
slides directly to their iPad. Apps such
as GoodReader, iAnnotate and Evernote
will also be used to facilitate note taking.
Students are being asked to carry out
their research and coursework using
sites such as Posterous, Facebook and
Twitter, work which will be facilitated
by the iPad. Coursework will involve
building websites, creating wordpress
blogs, making applications and filming
videos via iMovie.
An online “Communication hub”
has also been created for the course
that allows students to ask questions
