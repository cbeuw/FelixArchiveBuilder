Felix nominated for Guardian
Student Media Awards
“Marketeers cannot underestimate
the power of the digital and social
media age. If you looked at the users of
Facebook as a population, they would
represent the third largest ‘country’ in
the world. Customer experience on here
can make or break a brand overnight
and our teaching reflects this shift,” said
Colin Love.
“We want our students to understand
everything about these new and rapidly
changing technologies and how to
make the best use of them, and a large
part of that is immersing the students in
that world from day one.”

thank you to everyone who contributed
last year; this nomination is a recognition
of their tireless efforts.”
programme, told Felix that “the whole
class is extremely happy about this
‘gift’, especially because we do not
have to give the iPads back.” She also
added that “the iPad is much more
than a gift from Imperial College but it
is a real revolution and a new way of
conceiving the educational system.”
Colin Love believes that the MSc
in Strategic Marketing “will equip
students with the marketing skills that
are immediately relevant for companies,
business leaders and entrepreneurs
around the world.” Applications

and discuss topics with lecturers
and other students, as well as share
files and videos. It is also hoped that
the feedback time from lecturers to
students will be reduced, enhancing
student satisfaction.
Behind the development of this new
course is its Director, Colin Love, who
explains that “instead of just being a
marketing programme where we trot
out all the standard books”, the Business
School has attempted to “turn it around
into being something that focuses on
the latest technology, communication
techniques and social media networks.”
