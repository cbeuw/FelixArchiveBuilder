FELIX
Friday 07 OCTOBER 2011
T
he 18th century French philoso-
pher Denis Diderot once said
â€˜Only passions, great passions,
can elevate the soul to great
things.â€™
I have never been one to attach much impor-
tance to helping others. Being an only child, I
never had the time to think whether life was
treating others as fairly as it did me. There
have been times when I was known to scorn
those who did not do as well as their counter-
parts.
However, all that changed when I had the
chance to meet some amazing people last year
during fundraising events, such as collections
for the Pakistan flood victims and bone marrow
transplant for young children. The media give
but brief glimpses of the sadness that prevails
outside our comfort zones.
It was not long before I realised that a person
could not survive in this world alone. That was
how my passion for community service came
into existence. I a extremely pleased to say that
this passion has brought about a great change in
me â€“ a change that I shall proudly carry through-
out my life.
Arecent documentary, aired on Channel 4, dis-
cussed the Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka. The Sri
Lankan Government and The Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam were at war, with the innocent
Tamil civilians stuck in between. Seeing moth-
ers sitting on dirty floors, clasping little babies
to their bosoms, whilst crying out for mercy, was
appalling. The footages showing women corpses
being sexually abused were abhorrent to anyone
viewing the documentary.
After watching this, I really felt for the Tamil
civilians. The war ended more than two years
ago, but the wounds are still fresh. I used social
networking websites to get in touch with Tam-
ils, who could provide me more information on
the issue and also advise me how I could be of
any help. Through this, I learnt about the Tamil
Aid Charity, whose main focus was constructing
schools for Tamil children in Sri Lanka. By then,
I had the basic idea in mind: taking part in an
activity to raise money for the TamilAid charity.
During this time, it was the Holy month of Ra-
madan. My perception of Ramadan was a test
of patience and a feel for how the poor people
lived. Keeping this in mind, I decided to par-
ticipate in a 10 km run, whilst fasting, to raise
money for the Tamil Aid charity.
Deciding on a beautiful 9.4 km Aberdeen
beach circuit, the next step was to create a page
on Just Giving and on Facebook. That was all
straightforward. The harder bits were yet to
come â€“ how exactly is a person, out of shape like
myself, supposed to run 10 km â€“ whilst fasting?
Needless to say, I had to devise a proper plan
to execute the task successfully. Going in straight
for the run, without practising, would have been
suicidal; especially since I had little more than
a week to train myself to develop the required
stamina to survive the run. My training pro-
gramme consisted of two parts, stamina building
and following a high carbohydrate diet. I found
it very hard to leave all the scrumptious Indian
curries behind, and instead eat large amounts of
pasta, rice, tuna and energy bars. The training
consisted of three sets of runs, two 3 km and one
5 km. This had to be done on alternate days, just
before sunset, so I could finish my run in time to
break my fast.
The one thing I looked forward to everyday
was that one sip of water, which I would break
my fast with after the training. Meanwhile, I up-
dated my statuses on social networking websites
to collect the donations. After sending almost
600 text messages and writing on 500 peoplesâ€™
Facebook profiles individually, I almost touched
my target of Â£1,000.
Friday, 26th August 2011, the big day had fi-
nally come. It wasnâ€™t until 6pm that I headed to
an open field near the chosen beach circuit for
warm up. By 7pm, I was at the start line, all set
and ready to go. The weather was sunny â€“ a real
gift inAberdeen. Setting off and pacing up, I was
lucky to have a cool breeze! Contending with an
Fast times for charity
unplanned incline at the halfway point , I had
to reduce my speed to a jog and take a break. I
continued running, whilst shuffling through the
music playlist on my iPod â€“ completing the final
section quicker than expected. To my surprise, I
was back at the starting point â€“ I had completed
the circuit!
Including my jog back home, I had run 10.2
km in just over an hour, including three short
breaks. It was not over yet of course â€“ I had to
wait for half an hour for sunset, before I could
break my fast. Later that evening, I went to a lo-
cal restaurant for a feast.
I had successfully managed to cross my target
of Â£1,000. I was glad to have taken the initiative
of raising money for the Tamil Aid charity, as I
am sure that the money will serve the Tamil chil-
dren well. We may come from different back-
grounds, races or religions, but the one thing all
of us have in common is a heart, which beats 72
times a minute.

Welcome to the Clubs & Societies section! Here
youâ€™ll find all manners of reports from the extra-
curricular side of Imperial, which, in case you didnâ€™t
go to Freshersâ€™ Fair, is pretty massive.
If you think your club has the chutzpah to send
us a report on one of your events or trips (and not
to mention a few photos) go ahead do it! If you can
keep it below a rough
maximum of 1000
words, then perfect!
If not, just let us know
and weâ€™ll be able to
sort something out.
If youâ€™re still crav-
ing some information
about societies that
you might have missed,
either at Freshersâ€™ Fair
or throughout your time
at Imperial, then why
not take a look at this
yearâ€™s Clubs, Societ-
ies & Projects Handbook? If you havenâ€™t yet come
across it, then you can find it available online from
the Imperial College Union website imperialcolleg-
eunion.org.
Thereâ€™s plenty of choice around, so youâ€™re bound
to find a society that caters to your tastes, no mat-
ter how wild they might be!
