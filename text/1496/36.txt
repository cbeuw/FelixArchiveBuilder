This tour had it all; no sleep, local deli-
cacies, someone getting lost, British
weather – and some great rugby. Whilst
this describes the tour to leave it at
that would not do it justice. C&G RFC
celebrated the end of the season with
a 4-day tour to Berlin where they par-
ticipated in the 2nd International Rugby
Union Sevens.
Sevens captain Niall Watson did ev-
erything in his power to get his team
to the airport on time – driving a mini-
bus through midnight London, picking
up stragglers at the Union, Belushi’s
Hammersmith and Belushi’s Fulham.
Thanks to his dedication, the team
caught their flight on time and enjoyed
a little power nap before getting woken
up gently by the pilot when he crashed
down on Berlin Schonefeld airport. Tour
translator Max Joachim awaited the
tour party which quickly made its way
through Berlin to their accommodation
in Hohen Neuendorf, a little town just
north of Berlin. The local rugby club
Rugby Union Hohen Neuendorf had
organized the 2nd international Rugby
Union Sevens and did everything they
could to make us feel at home – they
even brought in some proper English
weather – but let’s not get ahead of
ourselves. After a quick lunch, we took
public transport again to meet our guide
for a bicycle sightseeing tour through
Berlin.
The weather was fantastic and the
guide made sure that there were plenty
of breaks on the way so that we didn’t
exhaust ourselves before the Sevens
the next day. Seeing the Reichstag, the

Imperial captains gear up for new season

Head of Sport Imperial Neil Mosley
sounded the start of the new sports
season on Monday at the Club Cap-
tains’ meeting held in Ethos. Introduc-
ing himself and the rest of the Sport
Imperial team to the hundred or so
team captains and sports club commit-
tee members, he was full of praise for
the achievements of IC sports clubs
last season. “Five years ago, our ob-
jective was to get into the BUCS (Brit-
ish Universities and Colleges Sport)
league table top twenty. I’m delighted
to say we did it.”
Imperial has indeed seen an ex-
ceptional rise in the BUCS rankings,
climbing from 39th at the end of the
2006 season to 17th at the close of last
season. Impressive wins for the fenc-
ers and a haul of points from the Im-
perial Boat Club are among the main
successes of last year, but points have
come from an extremely wide range of
sports in an excellent sporting year (as
reported by your favourite newspa-
per). Mosley has ambitious plans for
the future, with a very concrete short-
term goal: “We finished just behind
Leeds University last year, who have
more than thirty thousand students.
The gap was only ten points – that’s
nothing, it’s a podium finish at BUCS.
We’re aiming to beat Leeds this year.”
Moving past a university with al-
most three times the amount of stu-
dents we have is no mean feat – but
apparently Sport Imperial has loftier
goals: “Ultimately, in the next few
years, the objective is to finish higher
than Cambridge, who are in 14th place
at the moment. There’s already an aca-
demic rivalry with them, and getting
past them in the league tables would
mean a lot to many people at Impe-
rial.” However, unlike Cambridge
or Oxford (10th), Mosley says there
won’t be a concerted effort to attract
elite-level sportspeople – we won’t
be having ex-All Blacks on our rugby
team any time soon.
Nevertheless, such ambition does
cost money, and Sport Imperial have
been establishing commercial partner-
