Generic Solution
The aim with Slitherlink
is to make one continuous
closed loop by connecting
the dots. The numbers in
each square indicate how
many edges of the square
are part of the loop, so if it
contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out
of four edges have lines.
That’s all the info you
need to get the one logi-
cal answer (though waiting
a week to see the solution
will also do). Answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk, as the
puzzles team recieves one hour of sunlight per correct solution.
These are Nonograms. Notice the recurring theme with
this puzzles page, a mass of black and white squares with
numbers at random points. Lucky you!
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid
have to be coloured or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken lines or
filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.
Look at the example solution for help. The solution
should give a picture depending on how drunk you are.

The League
of FUCWITs
Howdy y’all. I’ll get the pleasantries
out of the way. Family good? Cool.
Right, you’re all a smart bunch. I
know you’ll only do something if
there’s something you can get in re-
turn. That’s the way to play it, capiche?
So, why do these puzzles (which let’s
face it, are glorified problem sheets) in
your spare time? Well, let me tell you
about FUCWIT.
FUCWIT (the Felix University/Col-
lege Wide Invitational Tournament) is
a league table giving you the chance
to win prizes for solving puzzles. Send
in any solutions on these pages to
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk to earn
points. The person and team (hell yeah,
you can do it as a team) to earn the
most points gets a very special prize
at the end of the year. And trust me
on this, this ain’t no secondary school
poetry competition with a £10 book to-
ken. We talkin’ stuff people want.
