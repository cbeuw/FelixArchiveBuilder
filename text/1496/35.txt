In this ‘age of austerity’ skiing and
snowboarding can still remain afford-
able for students. Tough times call for
tough measures. So now Snowsports
clubs from across the land of London
have come together to bring snowy
fun to the masses (i.e. you) at good ol’,
pre-tuition-fee-scandal, student prices!
While you were busy working on those
tans that the days of revision and exams
denied you, your lovely Snowsports
committee were looking out for your
winter needs.
As the summer ends we are pleased to
announce the formation of another hy-
brid word and a new era of: the London
Snowoperative! What does it mean?
This winter’s trip will be the biggest
yet with Greenwich, University of Arts
London, Southbank University and Ra-
vensbourne College joining Imperial in
a fleet of coaches all going to Les Arcs,
France. Combining the trip in this way
has lead to a reduced cost that doesn’t
compromise on resort location or qual-
ity of service.
What’s more, now that October has
come and the weather is shite again,
you can look forward to meeting other
London students on Snowsports socials:
on our trips to snow domes and as we
travel to competitions including the
weekend trip to Edinburgh in Novem-
ber (aka BUDS). To welcome this new
Snowoperative into action Imperial will
be hosting a We Are Metric night (Octo-
ber 20). “On this night we invite anyone
that has ever wanted to ski or snow-
board to join us in celebrating this new
venture!” Gerry Hawkins, Social Sec-
retary, shared. “Everyone else come for
the fun times and free beverage,” added
the trip’s organiser Vlad Demerdzhiev,
“enjoy this one responsibly – the rest is
up to you.”
Wikipedia teaches us that a coopera-
tive is “an autonomous association of
persons united voluntarily to meet their
common economic, social, and cultural
needs and aspirations through jointly
owned and democratically controlled
enterprise.” The Snowoperative will
also strive to meet your snow-related
needs and aspirations. Be they learning
to ski or board, or landing rodeo fives
- or if you just want to make an igloo
and join in the après-ski. For example,
the fresher taster session (October 19)
will also be joint with the Snowopera-
tive with two coaches of students head-
ing to Milton Keynes’ snow dome for
recreational ski with features or a lesson
available at a huge discount.
The Snowoperative is thus far com-
posed of the core five universities –
however others have already expressed
interest and growth is expected next
year. “This is a sport which is not all
about the rivalry but the revelry,” ex-
plained Luke Bridgestock – Freestyle
Captain and PhD student, “This is the
start of something special that will con-
tinue on.”
Prices for the annual winter trip to
the alpine mountains had been increas-
ing year on year. As always the aim has
been to make the trip as affordable as
possible so that it is not only attended
by the super keen (gnarly, power-hun-
gry specimens that you are) but also by
those that want to keep the recreational
student life going over winter. It is a
time to bond over vin chaud and have
silly fun with other students in the snow.
After all, it’s not long until our holidays
will be limited by our careers and stu-
dent prices are snatched away from us!
London snowsports clubs needed to
unite and do some serious negotiating!
Matt Edwards, treasurer, assures us that
the Snowoperative efforts have been
successful: “This year, the trip costs less
than last year and the year before that.”
The most significant change the Sno-
woperative trip will bring Imperial
students is the variety of social oppor-
tunities. Of course, being the indepen-
dent adults that you are – it’s up to you
what you choose to get involved in. If
you want to keep it a personal trip with
friends, that is still possible. Accommo-
dation will remain as self catered, apart-
ment rooms to give you a base. Les Arcs
offers a huge skiing area to explore and
you can enjoy the freedom however you
like. On the flipside, if your aim is to get
to know new people then there will be a
range of events to attend in the coming
months: union nights like We Are Met-
ric, weekend trips away (BUDS), pre-
mieres of ski and snowboarding films,
the chance to try out racing for free and
more. This year will be unlike any year
Imperial has ever seen – the world of
Snowsports is opening up to everyone.
Snowsports clubs collaboration will ‘reduce prices’
