id you have a nice sum-
mer? You did? That’s
nice.
As for myself, I, like
many people travelled
far away for a spell in prison. Alright,
it may be more accurately described as
a holiday in the sun, but as I lay there on
my sun/cell-bed, I couldn’t help musing
over the similarities.
For one thing: getting there. Tenerife
is a little farther afield than Strangeways
and Benidorm is more than a few stops
on from Broadmoor, but you still need
to get there. Be it on an armoured bus
with the fug of resignation in the air or a
Boeing 747 airplane where the disparate
smells of boiled sweets, sun cream and
baby vomit diffuse together, travelling
is never a wholly delightful experience.
Once you arrive, nothing changes.
After a bureaucratic check-in, you are
shown to your room, which contains a
bed and a bath and/or sink. Whether or
not you have the furnishing of a truly
enlightened society such as tea-making

Another year of undue praise!
And next to it, the
mayonnaise – is that
genuine or have the
guards… spat in your
food?
Fun in the Sun
take the form of a risky, risqué affair
in the showers around a bar of soap or
an ABBA tribute act in the lounge bar.
To this day, I don’t know which is more
horrific.
Some people patiently see out their
sentence by reading a few books and
dreaming a few dreams. Others try to
obliterate themselves in brightly co-
loured alcohol and fast, meaningless
sex*. Others become so institutionalised
that once they leave, normal life is so
frightening for them that they quickly
return to the warm embrace of cosy fa-
miliarity. Recidivism is as much a prob-
lem in Gran Canaria as it is in Belmarsh.
Very few dare abscond from their im-
prisonment. I was only able to escape
and bring you this article by tunneling
through the wall behind a poster of Rita
Hayworth.
*Sex, in this usage, can include eve-
ning-long games of Gin Rummy
facilities depends on your connections.
You will meet most of the other tourists/
in-mates in the exercise yard. Whether
said exercise involves a cheeky dip in
the pool or breaking rocks with your
fists is up to your own individual tour
rep/guv’nor.
In both situations, you quickly lose
track of time as the days blur into one
repetitive tableau. Your only way of
marking the time, and primary form
of entertainment, is scoring the days
into your bedpost. Either way, you will
count down to your eventual return to
civilisation and normalcy.
Most days pass in a blur of confusion
and fear. As you find your table in the
dining hall, you wonder if that’s an on-
ion ring on your plate or maybe squid
(or something with even more tenta-
cles). And next to it, the mayonnaise – is
that genuine or have the guards … spat
in your food?
The nights bring little relief. More of-
ten than not you are afflicted by cruel
and unusual punishments. These can
T
o those of you starting a
new chapter of your lives
at Imperial this month,
welcome. This is the only
paragraph you’re getting
dedicated to you for the rest of the year
if I can help it. Breathe it in. I’m here
for you. I care. Listen to these words of
encouragement and sympathy. Your life
is hard, but well done for making it this
far. All of those exams you had to do,
poor little you. It must’ve been really
hard to coast on the back of natural abil-
ity, copious amounts of privately funded
education, or an impeccable national
education system. Congratulations for
being you. Pats on the back all round.
Right, done. Normal service resum-
ing - welcome back, shitsacks. Every-
one happy to be back here, are we? I
do hope not. I hope it’s sapping your
very will to live just dragging your
pathetic, decaying brains along Ex-
hibition Road and up to the gates of
the college. Yeah, that’s it. Cry a bit.
Well up a little as you remember what
coursework submission smells like
on a Monday morning at 10am. Weep
into this jar here so I can massage it
into my gums later for sustenance. It’s
another academic year, sweet cheeks.
It’s a great time of year. A time of
year when my social media feeds fill
up with messages from Imperial grad-
uates ‘jokingly’ discussing how long it
is until they can retire from the shitty,
money-fuelled job they took as soon
as they could leave Imperial with a
2:1, whilst I can enjoy sitting in the
JCR, slowly watching the day-by-day
decline in the parabola defining the
smiles on first year faces. The season
of 9am lecture starts in the ball-aching
cold. I chuckle not because I innately
hate humankind, but because I’m tired
of having Imperial pander to its stu-
dents so readily.
The way first-years are treated-
defines Imperial’s attitude towards its
students. They’re praised for having
gotten so far, for gaining entry to one
of the top universities in the world. It’s
talked about as if most of the students
actually worked for their qualifica-
tions, as if the majority of Imperial
undergraduates gave a shit about their
subject or their results. It’s amusing,
as well as being incredibly heartbreak-
ing. As an institution, we couldn’t give
a monkey’s wankbucket whether or
not we create the scientific minds of
tomorrow. We care about two things -
getting the best students on day one,
and pumping out the highest earners
on day three hundred and sixty-four.
The former ensures the latter, and so
we raise our standards of entry, sit
back and relax. Who cares what hap-
pens in the intervening years? As long
as the statistics come out right and the
league tables say what they should,
then we’re golden.
I’m feeling generous this year so let
me toss in a free extra paragraph for
new starters. Imperial contains some
of the most amazing research, inspir-
ing teachers and incredible resources
you will ever have access to. The path
of least resistance will put you in con-
tact with almost none of this. Cruise
through, hit those pass requirements,
and spend the rest of your days drink-
ing yourself into oblivion, and you
will leave as an Imperial graduate to
applause and deep, meaningless re-
spect from everyone around you. En-
gage with your subject, talk to people
that interest you, and find out more
about why you came here in the first
place, and you’ll leave in pretty much
the same circumstances. But you’ll be
a different person. You’re paying a lot
for the chance to spend four years at
this place.
Recently, Silvio BerLADsconi
(as no-one calls him) has been
on top form in terms of scandal.
He has had so many trials in
his time that it’s actually hard
to keep track. Currently, he is
involved in four separate trials;
three for corruption and tax eva-
sion, one involving being black-
mailed by a pimp - in which he is
not the defendant (that’s prob-
ably the most unsettling part).
Gianpaolo Tarantini is the
man allegedly running a prosti-
tution ring that Berlusconi regu-
larly used to obtain girls. The
trial centres around recordings
that Tarantini secretly made of
Berlusconi. There are too many
great quotes to fit here, but as
the 80s song goes I’ll hit you
with my best shot.
Berlusconi called Angela
Merkle an “unfuckable lard-
arse”. Good to know that those
words have a direct Italian-to-
English translation.
After insulting the Chancel-
lor of the country that’s about
to bail out Italy, he decided to
insult Italy. He referred to it as
a “shitty country” saying he
wants to leave. Then defended
this remark by saying it was
the sort of thing you say late at
night when you are relaxed. We
all know how he gets that “re-
laxed” and if that’s what he’s
like when he’s relaxed, what
the fuck is he like when he’s
agitated?
He also claimed he was the
PM in his “spare time”. Con-
tradicting the earlier claim that
he was the “Jesus Christ of
politics” who “just kept giving”.
Maybe by giving he meant either
giving prostitutes semen onto
their faces or a lot of money
for sex. He gives that a lot. Per-
haps he’s trying to kick-start the
economy by getting the prostitu-
tion profession back on its feet.
He bragged about his sexual
exploits saying: “Last night I
had a queue outside the door of
the bedroom … There were 11
… I only did 8, because I could
not do it anymore.” He is a man,
so is prone to exaggeration. He
even actively picked less round-
ed numbers.
At one point he turns to the
pimp and says: “the pussy
needs to go around”. Now I’m
starting to think that he was
actually just writing rap lyrics at
the time that quote was taken.
Tim’s PolitiLOLz of the week
Love arguing? Yes. Good. Why don’t you email us and join in a head-
to-head. It’s like fighting, but more passive aggressive. The topic for
next week is: Should the 50p tax rate be abolished?
