City and Guilds 7s German tour a success
Brandenburg gate and the Berlin wall
was great but the biggest cheers were
heard when the afternoon beer/kebab
break was announced. Result of the
afternoon: no casualties, Tom Cotton
learnt how to ride a bike and Ed Jinks
really does love kebabs.
Tired and thirsty, we travelled back
up north again to be greeted with a
BBQ by our hosts.After enjoying their
hospitality for an hour or two, we were
surprised to see Tom Godfrey making
his way towards the club house. Ap-
parently, we had lost him in Berlin but
his impeccable knowledge of the Ger-
man underground got him back safely.
After more socializing and “intercul-
tural exchange” awe took over our
“accommodation” – some luxurious
tents on a beach rugby pitch next to the
actual rugby pitch. The night brought
the aforementioned English weather
but luckily, the tents were able to keep
us dry. Being engineers, we decided to
make our upcoming nights more com-
fortable by buying some air mattresses
before heading over to the club house
for a fantastic breakfast – the secret to
any success.
The weather didn’t improve much,
and even the late arrival of our inspira-
tional leader and captain Niall couldn’t
brighten the skies: it kept raining and
it felt like it was getting colder and
colder throughout the day. That didn’t
stop us from showing off our Sevens
skills during the pool stage of the
Rugby Union Sevens tournament. Our
first opponent, the local Veltener Rug-
by Club, had no chance against some
fierce defending and great running in
attack so that an easy 31-0 win was re-
corded by tour secretary Toby Spittle.
Even more tries were scored against
the U18s side of the hosts, the “RU
Young Wolves”, and the Swiss team
RC Bombers Zug. The toughest match
of the day was the last one against de-
fending champions RK 03 Berlin who
just finished 7th in the German first di-
vision; the Bundesliga. Again, our de-
fense was the corner stone of our suc-
cess. Our two tries and one conversion
was too much for the Berliners who
only managed to score one try – 12-7
and first place in pool B for the C&G
RFC – what a result!
The other pool was topped by the
second RK 03 team followed by the
hosts RU Hohen Neuendorf. That
meant we were to face the hosts in the
cup semifinal on the following day. A
devious plan by the hosts meant that
they organized a players’ party for
Saturday night which we were quick
to take advantage of. Our fancy dress
for the evening, Ancient Greeks, was
admired by the locals. The handover
between current and future ICURFC
club captain, started an ‘interesting’
evening that ended in the early hours
on Sunday.
After another exceptional breakfast
on Sunday, we discovered that we al-
ready made it to the final because both
RK 03 teams did not make it back to
the tournament on Sunday after having
a beer or two too many. That meant we
were to play the last match of the tour-
nament against RU Hohen Neuendorf.
Niall had problems finding enough
players for the team after injuries and
hangovers decimated our side. We em-
ployed one ringer in the form of one
RK 03 player who joined us so that we
went into the Cup final with some op-
timism.
The hosts showed us from the off
that they wanted to win in front of
their own fans. They quickly went two
tries up before our own resident Ger-
man, Max Joachim, brought us back
into the game with a converted try
just before half-time. Unfortunately,
the beers from Saturday night were
holding us back a bit so that we didn’t
manage to score any more points. The
second place was celebrated with the
ships to bring in the funds that will
go towards success. A happy con-
sequence of this was announced on
Monday: Varsity will be free for all
students this year. “We want to see if
we can fill the Stoop”, said Mosley,
referring to the ground of the Harle-
quins team in Twickenham where the
Rugby Varsity Match will be played.
The other, much more visible,
consequence of Imperial’s renewed
sporting ambition is a new partner-
ship with sportswear company Kukri.
Beginning with this season, all sports
clubs will be able to order a wide
range of sport-specific kit in Imperial
colours.
This also meant that the second
part of the meeting on Monday was a
fashion show in the sports hall. Some
of the best looking sportsmen-and-
women strutted down the catwalk
in style (including my fellow editor
Dave Wilson) modelling everything
from rugby to volleyball attire. Kukri
are also producing Imperial hoodies
and tracksuits as part of their leisure-
wear range – which are on sale in
their new shop in Ethos.
As a sports editor, all of this sounds
very promising – and Felix Sport
hopes to bring you all the action ev-
ery Friday on the back page. One last
thing before I let you get on with your
Friday afternoon: we need contribu-
tors! Whether you were at the meet-
ing or have just signed up to a club,
any sports-related news or match re-
ports are more than welcome.
Just email them into sport.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, along with some
nice pictures - and you’ll more likely
than not find your exploits in the pa-
per!
hosts nevertheless before heading into
Berlin for one last night full of some
nakedness, a lot of kebabs and a few
beers before catching our flight home.
It was the end of a fantastic tour
that had brought the team even more
together and from which a number of
memories and stories will be recount-
ed. A lot of positive surprises were
noted on the pitch by strong perfor-
mances of freshers Will Griffiths and
Sean Jordan who put in some fierce
hits while winger Lukas Michalitsch
was able to practice his try celebra-
tions. The dedication shown by all the
players and the willingness to mingle
with the other teams and our hosts left
the Germans very impressed by the
C&G RFC and new C&G RFC club
captain Ed Jinks left Germany with
an invitation to the 3rd Rugby Union
Sevens next year. We also won the
prize for the best match shirts of the
tournament. We’d like to pay tribute to
our tour sponsors Chateau Six, Laing
O’Rourke, City & Guilds College As-
socation and PathMotion for allowing
us to make these fantastic experiences
possible.
