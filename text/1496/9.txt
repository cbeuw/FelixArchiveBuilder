Over the summer, we at the Union
have made some changes to the way
bar nights are organized and run. Some
of you may already have heard about
these changes. However, there is a lot of
rumour and innuendo ﬂoating about, so
I thought I would take this opportunity
to clarify what the changes are and why
we’ve had to make them.
In the past, we have run bar nights
by selling kegs directly to the group
organizing the night. These were sold at
just above cost price, and the intention
was to give student groups a chance
to give their members cheap drinks
and raise some money for their club.
However, this approach is no longer
sustainable. Firstly, we were losing
money every time a bar night was run, as
the keg price did not account for various

stafﬁng costs, including the (often quite
signiﬁcant) cleaning costs. Secondly,
in order to comply with our new
Responsible Retailing of Alcohol Code
of Practice, we need to avoid practices
that encourage excessive drinking. As
clubs were charged for any opened kegs,
regardless of how much had been drunk,
this encouraged people to ﬁnish off what
remained, even if they had already had
too much.
Instead, we have come up with a system
whereby the price of drinks can be
reduced, while making sure the bar night
doesn’t lose money for either the Union
or the club. Clubs can now order a bar
tab at a 10% discount: this saving can
be passed on to club members or used
as income for the club. The tab would
then normally be accessed with tokens
provided upon purchasing entry. With
any bar night, there is now a limit on
how many free drinks come included,
as stated by the Code of Practice – only
eight units (roughly four pints) can be
given for free.
When we sat down to update the policy,
we identiﬁed cheaper beer and fund-
raising as the main reasons for running
a bar night (as well as the social aspect).
We therefore think that this idea allows
clubs to fulﬁl one of these goals. It will be
difﬁcult to do both, as the sums don’t add
up, but we hope that this provides a way
for student groups to run bar nights in a
sustainable way so that neither the Union
nor the club loses out.
