Imperial Students Reject NUS
The students of Imperial College have
overwhelmingly voted to remain outside
the National Union of Students.
The referendum enjoyed a large turnout
of over 28% of Imperial's student popula-
tion, and almost three times that usually
seen for the election of Imperial's Union
President.
The final count took place on Saturday,
with 766 votes in favour of joining the
NUS facing an enormous 1983 votes. The
result will be a blow to the NUS, which
had high hopes for obtaining Imperial
College as a member.
The count looked set to be delayed after
the close of voting on Friday when David
Francis, head of the 'Yes' campaign, had
refused to sign the document declaring
that he thought the referendum had been
fairly and constitutionally run. This cere-
mony occurs after every important Union
election and helps prevent unnecessary
challenges from candidates once the
results are announced.
Counting could finally proceed at 3pm
on Saturday once a n e w document had

been prepared. The new version outlined
a number of problems that the 'Yes' cam-
paign had found with the regulations gov-
erning Union elections, but these were
not intended as a formal complaint. They
were signed by the returning officer as
well as Mr Francis in addition to the stan-
dard agreement documents.
While the result is the most significant
rejection of NUS affiliation since 1956, this
may not be the last current students will
see of referenda on the issue. Mr Francis
stated that the 'Yes' campaigners "didn't
expect to get it first time," and that this
year's campaign had provided "signifi-
cant momentum" for Imperial's associa-
tion with the NUS. It is conceivable that
Council may order a second referendum
as early as next year, assuming support
exists.
The original decision to run an NUS ref-
erendum attracted significant opposition
at the Council meeting which ordered it.
Many of the referendum's primary oppo-
nents ended up working for the 'No' cam-
paign, with the notable exception of
Union President and nascent College
celebrity Sen Ganesh, who supported the
'No' vote but originally proposed that the
ballot should take place.
The high turn-out in this vote indicates
that Imperial students may finally have
found a political debate to get their teeth
into. Certainly, greater student involve-
ment in Union issues would be widely
welcomed by all those involved.
