IC 6ths Win the Cup
ICUAFC 6th XI 2...0 U C L 6th XI
This was it, the Cup Final.
Motspur Park was the venue
on a blustery but clear day,
with conditions difficult for
both teams.
Our preparations for this
game had begun the previous
night, with Sugo's setting the
scene for a team dinner, fol-
lowed that morning with an
inspiring teamtalk from coach
Colin. We took to the field
knowing our duty, what had to
be done.
The game kicked off, both
sides fighting hard in what
was for many, the biggest
game of their careers. Initial
exchanges were easily dealt
with, nervousness evident in
the passing of both sides.
Then, from nothing, Jermyn
broke clear of their sluggish
back line on the left, and one-
on-one with the keeper he fin-
ished superbly in the bottom
right corner. IC had to with-
stand the inevitable onslaught
and did so magnificently, with
the offside trap working really
well with crucial tackles
made.
A couple of "accidental"
kicks here and there to break
up the opposition's passing
were well received by the
vocal crowd, who spurred us
on with classic singing and
some proper abuse (kwality
lads), though not by the ref.
who booked Wilson for a nice
sly hack.
With half an hour gone, a
succession of throw-ins on the
right gave the ball to Hine
who, weaving his way
through a group of players,
was crudely tripped 25 yards
out. It was a cynical challenge,
but the free kick was ideally
suited for a Warzee special,
and the big Belgian stepped
up and duly delivered a spec-
tacular goal, into the top left
corner. Now to keep a grip on
the game, no silly mistakes.
The U C L captain, obviously
annoyed at his team's per-
formance, suddenly exploded
to comments from the IC
crowd and attempted to head-
butt a supporter. He received
a yellow card when many felt
he warranted more, disgrace-
ful.
With UCL throwing men for-
ward after half time, we coped
well under pressure. Head and
Nikolich in their final game for
the club were working well at
the back, with the midfield
quartet battling and the strik-
ers pushing up. A couple of
counter attacks were all IC
had to show for things,
although good pressure by
Smden and Quaranta gave us
a few chances.
In the final ten minutes,
Drury usefully made an out-
standing point blank save
from a UCL set piece, as a goal
then could have been really
problematic.
The final whistle went with-
out any further scares and
captain Coker lifted the Cup
for the first time in 6th team
history. A n excellent end to
the season, by what was defi-
nitely a cup team, with irrever-
ent form in the league, that
could always pull it out of the
bag for the big occasion.
The main objective of the
season was achieved on
Monday when our first team
picked up a narrow and hard-
fought but ultimately
deserved victory over King's
to w i n the U L U challenge
Cup.
Squash is actually played
in teams of five, each player
opposed to a corresponding
ranked player from the other
team. We started off really
strongly at number two w i t h
Jeff playing some awesome
widths to easily brush aside
his opponent to cruise to a
magnificent 3-0 victory.
In the number five's game
Lazy crashed out 3-1,
despite some brilliant run-
ning and a massive effort.
This was the first game he
had lost all season and the
disappointment was clearly
Squash
visible on his face.
In the third match of the
day, Craig at number three
stayed in total control of his
court strode King's lethal
weapon, a six foot seven inch
giant of a man, called Jorgen
and originating from
game to demolish his oppo-
nent 3-0.
Up next was the number
one's game, and onto the
Denmark, who might as well
have been a rugby player: He
was truly massive. Despite a
really good effort from A l i N -
our best player - there really
was nothing that could be
done against this wizard
who was pulling out the
"nicks" from nowhere, and so
it was all d o w n to the last
game.
Reddy at number four was
up against a tough contest-
ant and after four closely dis-
puted games the scores were
level at 2-2.
On the decisive last game,
a cool display of champagne
squash from Reddy secured
the final set and the match
overall. Victory was finally
ours, the free beer tasted
good...
That puts an end to a real-
ly excellent season: 2nd in
BUSA, 1st in our U L U league
and this magnificent victory
in the U L U challenge Cup:
bring on next year!
