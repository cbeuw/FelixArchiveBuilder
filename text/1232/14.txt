LEQs: The Return
will,
I would like to add fuel to the
debate about the L E Q that has
been churning away over
most of this term.
On first hearing of the idea for
L E Q I was pleasantly sur-
prised - a good idea, I thought.
That'll save time, I thought.
How gullible I was. If you
have ever tried to enter infor-
mation on these forms (a task
in itself, as I had to email the
administrator twice regarding
a non-working password),
you'll find that it takes easily
as long as the paper version.
This is partly to do with the
fiddlyness of the bloomin' but-
tons - but mostly caused by
the torrent of abuse I felt com-
pelled to write at the end, in
the 'comments' box. While
this was obviously optional, I
just had to do it as the first
part was so tricky.
To add to this, was the fact
that I had 15 of the bloody
things to fill in. I gave up after
six. A better system must be
obtained, that is agreed, but
can we have one that doesn't
take up nine tenths of our free
time. Time for a return to
paper, I feel.
Yours etc.

Election Complaint
Dear Felix,
I was saddened to see that
Felix has departed from its
usual high standards of jour-
nalism in the front-page article
of issue 1231. I suggest in
future you should confirm your
sources more rigorously as the
article was littered with factu-
al inaccuracies.
Your readers may be interest-
ed to learn that the formal
complaint, which I made in
response to many grievances
expressed by the students I
represent, was in fact sent to
the returning officer by email
as required, before the count
commenced on Saturday
morning. Sellotape was not
involved at any time. Nor was
Blu-Tac, chewing gum, staples
or any other adhesive.
My sole argument is with the
procedure of the election,
mainly proxy voting, and the
difficulties this created for
those wanting to vote. These
include medical students,
whose interests are my
responsibility. Mr Francis was
not implicitly criticised in my
complaint, nor was that con-
clusion intended to be drawn
from the statement I put for-
ward. The sceptics among you
may believe that my complaint
was "sour grapes" on behalf of
Idris Harding, who happens to
be a medical student. This is
simply not the case. I am voic-
ing the complaints of a num-
ber of students who felt disen-
franchised during the voting
procedure.
The tone of the article sug-
gests that the re-running the
election will be an extrava-
gant waste of money that
could be used for student
activities. Ensuring democra-
cy at Imperial is money well
spent, even if it costs more
than a set of rugby jerseys.
Yours,
Shazia (ICSM SU President)
PS - Where did you get that
awful photo?!
You imply that a single, trivial
inaccuracy renders the article
'littered' with lies. It seems the
only fact you dispute regards
how your complaint was deliv-
ered. We certainly don't like to
get our facts wrong, so we
have apologised on Page 2.
We did not, in fact, say that
you had submitted your com-
plaint due to "sour grapes".
However, it is important to
point out that at least ten
members of Council (excluding
sabbaticals, of course) said
that they believe this to be the
case and it was these allega-
tions that were reported.
You did implicitly criticise Mr
Francis in your complaint. You
questioned the actions of the
Returning Officer (Mr Francis)
and those of the Election
Committee (chaired by Mr
Francis). You also questioned
whether or not the election
was run properly (an election
run by Mr Francis), though
admittedly stopped short of
questioning his adherence to
the constitution.
In answer to your final ques-
tion, we got that awful photo
from our photo archives. It is
locked in a cupboard in a base-
ment, so quite some explosive
charge will be required before
we're rendered unable to re-
use it. We thought the hat
rather suited you © AW
Garden Hall
Dear Felix,
Firstly following the letter
from the Garden residents last
week, I took up their kind offer
to tour Garden Hall and I must
say it very nice indeed. It is
clear why the residents are
very proud of the hall.
I want to address the key
issues relating to the proposed
sale of Garden Hall and what
the Union has been doing in
general with respect to
accommodation.
The Union has worked with
residences to undertake a
comprehensive price review of
halls and the recommenda-
talk back
tions will be taken to the
Rector. In the review, the
Union has been successful in
ensuring price cuts for
Linstead, Weeks and
Southside. In total over third of
rooms will have a price cut
next year.
It is clear that there has been
under-investment in halls of
residence over the last few
years and the Union has
worked with College to ensure
that the refurbishment of Halls
is made top priority. We have
commitment from the Rector
that Southside refurbishment
will commence next year.
Unfortunately as an asset
Garden Hall (with a total of 82
residences) is worth a lot of
money (over £10M) and given
the current financial position
of College it is necessary to
"sweat" our assets to improve
services for all. This money
will be used to pay for devel-
opment and refurbishment of
Southside which will benefit
more than 350 students.
There are no easy choices.
Ultimately I believe in the long
run we will have facilities to
match some of the best insti-
tutions in the world. The
Union believes that we must
have good quality affordable
accommodation that is easily
accessible to College, but it
will take time. There have
been too many short term
fixes and it is time to engage a
long-term strategy that will
benefit all students.

East Meets West
Dear Felix,
Following a letter about the
East Meets West show, I
thought it would be appropri-
ate to reply. Whilst I do not
