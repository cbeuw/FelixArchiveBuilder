eggs easter
A n intrepid team of taste-testers from the Felix editoral and reporting crew undertook to test twenty of the best-selling Easter
Eggs to help you decide w h i c h your loved-ones would receive this Easter. Taste, toys and packaging were scrutinised careful-
ly, and the results are laid out below. It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it.
Guylain •
"The only thing I know that's
worse dipped in beer" said
one taster, the others com-
plaining that the chocolate
was a bit dull - "Uh! Uh! Yuk!"
wrote one. A box of choco-
lates was included, w h i c h
one taster loved, and the oth-
ers dismissed as "vomit."
Smarties •
A number of reviewers were
unable to stop giggling at this
point as sugar overwhelmed
their brains. The egg was
nice, if a little bland, and the
tubes of Smarties were good.
We got two letter 'N's on our
lids. The foil on the egg was
also "very pretty."
Maltesers (Favourite)
The egg was distinguished
by the presence of little hon-
eycomb pieces embedded in
the shell. W a i e this was gen-
erally w< 1
ived, one
member ,oted thai it looked
like "chocolate ac»e." Two
bags of Maltesers completed
this favourite choice.
Creme Egg
"How pedestrian!" screamed
one reviewer, as the team
began to get very high on
sugar. "Two Creme Eggs is
never enough" insisted
another, while one taster
pointed out that the eggs
were a bit dryer than usual.
Another picture of a chicken.
A Mars
The egg was nice, but one
reviewer exclaimed "please
let me out of here," while oth-
ers declared themselves inca-
pable of writing any coherent
sentences with this much
sugar in their bloodstreams.
The Mars bars didn't go any-
where quickly.
Organic Milk •
This did little better than the
Organic Dark egg - "tastes of
fish" and "vomitescent
smeg" sprung to the lips of
our reviewers. Other choco-
late also sprung to their lips
as they struggled to get rid of
the taste. No bonus again -
miserable!
Caramel •
"I feel sick" stated one
reviewer before this egg was
even opened, probably due to
excessive chocolate con-
sumption. This egg was gen-
erally a bit average, and
nobody was in the mood for
the run-of-the-mill two bars of
Cadbury's Caramel.
A Minstrels
"I don't like the foil on that"
exclaimed one expert, com-
plaining the blue was a bit
garish. There were two small
eggs rather than a single big
one, and two packs of
Minstrels. Opinions ranged
from "says 'Happy Easter'" to
"not very nice at all."
•4 Aero
"Dull," "cardboardy and arti-
ficial" exclaimed the panel.
"Too much air and not enough
chocolate" also summed up
the team's worries about the
amount of bubbles in the bars
which accompanied the egg.
It was all much like "sun-
baked concrete," apparently.
Orange Mini-Segments
Easily in second place, this
was also the last egg to be
tasted. Despite severe illness
sweeping the tasting team,
the (admittedly limited)
orangey segments went
down vere will with a deli-
ciously smooth orange-
flavoured egg, if a bit soft.
