CATERING
This
Week
Wednesday Thursday
Union
Events
Cheesy Wotsits
Would that be a
Wednesday I hear call-
ing my name? Or is it
the echo of drunken
sportspeople dancing to
Steps? I just don't know.
Union, Till Hell Freezes...
Sound Band Night
Sound, mate. Mos Eisly,
apparently. Possibly it's
some music. Would
seem reasonable. Or
maybe just sound. Sorry.
Just joking, fellas.

At
The
Movies
Monte Christo
Related to the Life of
Brain only by an incredi-
bly tenuous Monty gag,
this film probably won't
have any Messiahs in it
at all. But it might have
some very naughty boys
Time Machine
Rah rah rah. Victorian
gentleman (who proba-
bly used to visit brothels
and knife prostitutes...
they were bastards in
those days) builds a
time machine. Heard it.

Anti-Seen
Um. Maybe they're a
band. If I thought for a
minute that any of you
will even think of going
to see this, I'd make
more of an effort.
Underworld
Bilal
May be interesting. To
my uncultured ears it
sounds like it might not
be Indie. Could give it a
go, if you want to be
experimental for the day.
