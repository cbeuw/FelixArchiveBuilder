mperial vs The World
On the 1st of March a small
team consolidated from
Imperial's three teams (lsts,
2nds and Ladies), took a trip
to Leiden University (near
Amsterdam) for a much prized
basketball tournament. We
chose to travel by bus, which
turned out to be the only bad
decision made all weekend, on
and off the court.
As most people can proba-
bly imagine basketball players
tend to be on the tall side and
so cramming their 6 ft plus
frames into the less than gen-
erous 1ft of leg space proved
interesting, but despite this
we all survived the trip to
Leiden, after a brief stopover
in Amsterdam for some recre-
ational activities in the early
evening. We registered our
team, which consisted of two
ladies, two 1st teams players
and two 2nd team players.
After registering and getting
our free T-shirt the games got
going pretty much immediate-
ly-
Altogether around 36 teams
from all over Europe partici-
pated in the event. The tour-
nament itself was mixed and
as a result was adapted to
suit. N e w rules enforced
included two girls on court at
all times, guys weren't
allowed to block girls, the
ladies score three per basket
to a guys two and, dare I say
it, NO DUNKING.
All the teams where divided
into groups of between 5 and 6
and the top three teams in
these groups were then
selected for the next group
stage. The losers we separat-
ed into groups of their own
and got to battle it out for 36th

IC Devils 4...2 London Legions
The IC Devils chalked up
their second successive w i n
in this tense derby match. A
solid team performance com-
bined w i t h an outstanding
goalkeeping display from
man-of -the-match A d r i a n
Gill, ensured a memorable
victory. Under the leadership
of Dan, w i t h David's captain-
cy and Terry's tactical knowl-
edge, the Devils produced a
memorable performance
belying their relative inexpe-
rience. M a x and Squashi
opened the scoring in the
first period, before the
Legions finally put one past
the seemingly unbeatable
Adrian. The score remained
2-1 to the Devils at the end of
the first. Under heavy-pres-
sure, the calming influence
of Alex and Darren combined
w i t h unorthodox defending
by 'C.Penguin1
and Kamal
ensured that the Legions
would not score early in the
second. A Devils breakaway
rounded-off by M a x
increased the lead back to a
two-goal margin. Late in the
second, the Legions hit back
to make the scores 3-2 going
into the final period. The
Legions pressed for an
equaliser, but they were
once again denied by a
series of superb saves by the
Devils goaltender. The silky
skills of Vince and Dmitry
combined with the presence
of Thierry and A n d y ensured
that the Devils would not
fold. The pressure finally
relented after Tom scored
w i t h a well-taken chance.
The score remained 4-2, and
the Devils had beaten the
Legions.
place... yeah!
Despite losing the first
game by a point our team was
in good spirits, some more
than others, and we began to
notice that some of the other
sides we borrowing players.
While our girls suffered and
we lost another couple of
games, this time by slightly
larger margins, we began to
cotton on and recruited some
rather nice French ladies. This
gave our girls a good rest and
also improved our results sub-
stantially.
One of the outstanding
aspects of the tournament
was the ability of the ladies.
Some of the European girls
had serious skills and one had
such a hot handle (good ball
handler) that she basically
walked through the opposi-
tion. The second notable
aspect was the fact that
London air must be lacking in
the growth hormones present
in European air. At 6'4" I con-
sider myself tall but I was a
midget compared to most of
the Dutch population: even
some of their lady folk!
A l l things considered
Imperial didn't do too badly:
our record was played 10, lost
5 won 5... including a storm-
ing demolition of a team of
girls from Glasgow.
In addition to this a couple
of our players - including
myself - defected to a French
team and made it to the semis
only to be knocked out by a
poor refereeing decision at the
end of over time (he couldn't
tell the difference between a
male and a female) granting
three points to a bearded six
footer.
