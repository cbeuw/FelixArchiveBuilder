back talk
sonal remarks made against
me, I thought it was appropri-
ate to outline some of the deci-
sions taken and the reasons
behind them.
(a) The Indian Society
Committee were made
fully aware of the fire
capacity in advance and
confirmed in a meeting a
week before their event.
The fact is that there were
640 people in the audience
and 150 performers, giving
a total of 790 people. The
capacity of the M D H is 400.
Despite several requests, a
second overfill room was
not booked. The Union had
to intervene and put a
booking for the J C R to
ensure that there was
space to cater for the
excess.
(b) There were professional
Door Staff working on the
night using clickers, and to
claim that they miscounted
is serious allegation. By
law, the fire capacity can-
not be exceeded and it
would be criminal offence
to do so.
(c) The Indian Society nearly
breached the License
agreement by planning to
advertise in national
media. The Union again
intervened to pull the
advertising and stop the
authorities from closing
down the event.
I take offence to the allega-
tions made in the letter, I total-
ly refute the claim that the
Union had persecuted Indian
Society. The truth of the mat-
ter is that if the Union had not
stepped in, the show would
have been shut down due the
difficulties experienced by the
organisers. We acted in the
best interest of our members
and took action to ensure the
safety of all guests.
I would like to congratulate
the Indian Society Committee
on organising a very success-
ful event. We work with soci-
eties to continually improve
our procedures and services,
but the Union always wel-
comes constructive criticism
that allows us to improve
things for all.

Dear Felix,
A sudden and happy thought
came to me. It occurred to me
that there exist two similar,
yet very different organisa-
tions.
Both of them are spent as
political forces, though they
aspire to hold the clout that
they did 15 years ago.
Both have changed from pow-
erful organisations sticking up
for their customers, to two
clapped out, desperate collec-
tions of uninspired rightwing
gents.
Both of them are as useless to
the public as they are good at
eating up people's money.
One of them is a tabloid rag,
the other is a national student
body.
A n d their names are ana-
grams of each other. - can you
guess what they are?

Dear Felix,
I'm just writing to express my
general disgust that members
of the NUS executive have
been around college (though
noticeably not on college or
union grounds) this week, fol-
lowing the debate in the great
hall, distributing flyers to
everyone that walks past. Do
these people not have jobs to
do? If the NUS can afford to
have its key players wander-
ing around distributing flyers
all day instead of fighting on
students' behalves, is it really
the kind of organisation that
we should be joining?
This referendum is being held
amongst Imperial College stu-
dents, so surely they are the
only ones who should try to
influence the outcome - yet
another example of the NUS
sticking its nose in where it's
not wanted I guess.

And, Finally...
Dear William,
Far away from the evils of cap-
italism and union officers,
there's one small thing that's
bugging me about College I
wish I'd pointed out last year.
Why does virtually every stu-
dent talk to catering staff as if
they're human-shaped vend-
ing machines? In the best
cases, students seem to grunt
acknowledgement, in the
worst case ignore them alto-
gether. When you're paying for
your food or someone's cleared
your table for you, is a simple
"Thanks" too much to ask?
I know I'm starting to sound
like a Daily Mail reader, but
while students can seem to
get away with treating service
staff as sub-human here,
before you know it you'll all be
acting like that in cafes and
restaurants - and I know for a
fact if you're rude in places
like that they WILL spit in
your food!
Just trying to make the world
(and more hygienic) a better
place.
