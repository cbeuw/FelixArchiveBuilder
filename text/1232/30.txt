Shooting Off
On Sunday 10th the Imperial
College Rifle and Pistol Club
returned to Bisley's 200 yard
Short Siberia range to battle
for the Club's Jocelyn Thorpe
Cup for Full Bore Shooting
under Service Conditions.
The rules were simple: each
of the 12 competitors fires 12
rounds at the target w i t h
either a 2nd World War British
rifle or a 1st World War
American rifle. The first 2
shots are sighters, they don't
count towards the score but
allow the gun's sights to be
adjusted. The next ten shots
can each give a score of
between 0 and 5.
Everyone did well w i t h
most people getting over 25
points, although Uncle Jacob
blames his poor score of 3 on
the strong wind. The wind
and the rain however did
nothing to dampen spirits,
indeed combined with the
poor drainage it served to pro-
vide more accurate service
conditions as the range came
to resemble the Somme, with-
out the carnage or poetry.
In the afternoon Daniel, Ben
and Robin also did some 50m
small bore shooting. Daniel
beat Ben in one of their
rounds, but Ben got best
score of the day in another,
while the rest of us did some
snap fire targets.
At the end of the competi-
tion the results were as fol-
lows: Keith and Ben came
equal 4th, Woody came 3rd,
Big Mike came 2nd and the
winner of the Jocelyn Thorpe
Cup was Phil with an amaz-
ing score of 39 and one "V".
Wet and Wild
Last week, the IC swimming
and Waterpolo club organised
a swimming gala between
England's old rivals, France ,
themselves and Brunei uni-
versity.
The weekend got off to a
rocky start as the England
Rugby team got pounded by
the French, but this did noth-
ing dampen the already high
spirits of the IC club.
With the promise of booze,
the brunel team arrived bushy
eyed and bright tailed, also
hoping to whip some french
arse.
There were some very
impressive swims, especially
from Julio Georgiou who
stormed to an amazing and
unprecedented double wham-
my in the 50m and 100m
breast stroke. Good times
were also posted by Jon Page,
Jon Robinson, Chris
Haselwandter and Alex
Chklar.
Unfortunately, due to the
distinct lack of anything
vaguely female at IC, we had
to beg and steal from the elite
ULU squad to make up the
rest of the numbers, and they
helped take the IC team (58
points )to a stonking victory
over both the french (28
points) and the team from
Brunei (33 points).
In the near future, a crack
squad of swimmers will be
travelling over to frarice to
whip some more french botty
and get copiously drunk...
more results will follow, plus
the obligatory victory march
through the streets of london!
Alexander
Reserve Cup Final
IC II 1 2LSE II (aet)
After a storming into the Cup
Final with style and panache,
and scoring goals for fun along
the way, the mighty seconds
smelt success and glory. We
arrived at Motspur Park confi-
dent of bringing the Cup back
to IC, and in the words of
Sardines himself we were
determined to do the right
things, at the right times, in
the right places.
Stepping out onto the pitch
in the face of a force 10 wind
proved slightly difficult. We
battled like tigers out of
defence and managed to put
together a couple of decent
breaks and almost got an early
reward but were unlucky
inside the box, but this was to
be our only clear cut chance of
the half.
After twenty minutes the
ball bobbled inside the box
from a debatable LSEcorner,
and an economics muppet for-
tuitously stuck it in. At 1-0
down we kept battling but
couldn't produce the football
that has brought us so much
success and Sardines was not
a happy bunny at half-time. In
patches the magic returned to
our boots in the second half
and we started to knock the
ball around with some note-
worthy aggression and skill,
shown by Bassies from left
back and pint-necking maes-
tro Jon Don in the centre. A
break down the right flank
from Magic left the ball at
Cartwright's feet, and a beau-
tiful long ball into the channel
found Baskett up front.
Despite the LSE defenders'
attempts to find out what
underwear Brad was wearing,
Baskett outstripped him and
equalised superbly. With the
scores level and the phenome-
nal IC support behind us the
tigers roared on to better foot-
ball and were unfortunate not
to get a winner, especially
having found greater success
down our right flank and more
penetration all over the pitch.
Baskett was again released
one on one with the keeper
and an excellent effort into the
bottom corner was harshly
ruled out for offside. In extra
time IC again dominated our
much weaker opponents but
after the first period we were
still dead-locked, and at this
stage LSE introduced a recent-
ly released ex-con up front
who tried to intimidate
Cartwright and Jon Don with
a series of head butts, all of
which the ageing referee and
suspiciously young linesman
failed to notice. With only ten
minutes of the game left to go
and IC minds possibly on the
penalties we had been prac-
tising the last two weeks, LSE
grabbed a winner. It was more
than they deserved and
despite our sterling efforts
they held on for victory in a
match that never quite got
going for us. So despite all the
pre-match hype, expectation
and preparation, it was not
meant to be, and the cup will
not be in South Kensington
this year, but the mighty sec-
onds roar on and will doubt-
less be there or thereabouts
this time next year. Boost.
