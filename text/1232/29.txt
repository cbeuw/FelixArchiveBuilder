IC V 2 . .2S.O.PI
A n d so the curtain came down
on the long and distinguished
careers of the fifth team leg-
ends known as Skippy, Will,
Tinny and the Manatee.
As a relatively uneventful
first half drew to a close cen-
tre-back Tinny - in his last
game as captain - rose at the
far post to head home a pre-
cise corner from Will, to give
the IC boys a one-goal advan-
tage at half time.
The second -half began and
the fifths were taken by sur-
prise as an S.O.P kick-off lead
to them scoring within ten
seconds of the restart, without
a single IC player even getting
a touch.
Undeterred by this minor
hiccup, IC set about their task
again. After about twenty
minutes of sustained pressure,
the IC centre-forward was
adjudged to have been
brought down in the box.
There were no celebrations
yet however as IC fifths had
missed every penalty this sea-
son. Despite this JP stepped
up and slotted the ball home
coolly in true manatee fashion.
This made for a tense last
twenty minutes as the S.O.P
boys were in desperate need
of points to fight off relegation
worries. Despite some stiff
defending by IC, SOP scored
when the number 11 pounced
on a defensive error.
The game ended 2-2 and
unfortunately, the retiring
boys didn't get the send off
that their years of dedication
deserved.
IC I 28 14 LSE
With Slaps and Sooz missing,
and Jess injured, it could have
gone all wrong for our last
game, but we proved tri-
umphant! We won the first
quarter 9-3. With Jess suffer-
ing, we brought her off and
saved her for the last quarter,
in case it all went horribly
wrong.
It did, however, go worse
than that, showing what a
star player Jess is! We are too
used to the beautiful flow in
centre court with her there!
(Plus me at Centre - well that's
really far too much effort - oh
go on then, I'll use the excuse
I've had 2 concerts in the last
2 nights). Back came Jess for
the 3rd quarter with the
scores now 15-10. Supporters
arrived - Hannah returned to
the sidelines - and we pulled
it back to 23-12. LSE would
have to do something amaz-
ing to win now with one more
quarter to go. Ruthybaby
returned to Wing Attack and
whilst everyone was tiring,
we made some great intercep-
tions and made the final push
for victory. We won overall 28
goals to 14. Amazing shooting
by the legends that are Beckie
and 2nd team captain Jenny!
We should finish 5th in the
Premier League of ULU; we
just escaped relegation last
season so this is brilliant stuff!
Another season over, and
that's it for the Dream Team as
we know it. Bring on June
when we hit the shores of
Barbados for our first ever
tour....

While most of you were proba-
bly doing your last minute
Christmas Shopping, 83
Imperial students joined 1000
other students, in the resort of
Val Thorens for a week of ski-
ing and boarding at the BUSC
Third Event.
To celebrate our first night
in resort, a 70's Porn Star
theme night was held at one of
the local clubs. Our President,
Ben, set the standards for the
night by demonstrating that
mascara was not just for eye-
lashes - it could be used on
your chest hair too! Race
Captain, Ned followed suit
and was soon seen sporting a
hockey skirt, a fluffy yellow
top, and rather fetching impro-
vised breasts. Sadly, no one
informed the pair that the
largest gay event in the Alps
that season was being held at
the same venue, on the same
night, and consequently they
were baffled by the amount of
attention they received.
After two days of fantastic
skiing and boarding, it was
time for the 'Three Valley Rally'
where rudity, crudity, and
nudity won prizes. At various
checkpoints along the course,
teams had to do anything they
could think of that they
thought might earn them
points. Imperial teams
mooned, skied topless, did a
naked Y M C A , and apple
bobbed in rum in their attempt
to win. One of our group was
even heard to cry "But it
looked like a woman from a
distance" after snogging a
rather large German man.
On Wednesday night, to
keep up the ski club tradition,
we held one of our notorious
fondue nights. After a full days
skiing, we met at a restaurant
at the top of a mountain to
start drinking. Five hours later,
having eaten enough fondue
to last a lifetime, and having
drunk enough to keep Oliver
Reed the wrong side of sober
for several years, we began
our torch lit descent back
down into resort. Fortunately,
there were plenty of BUSC
reps on hand to take the most
incapacitated punters home
by snowmobile. Others insist-
ed that they could make it
back safely, only to be later
found fast asleep halfway
down the piste. Most recov-
ered in time to be able to
appreciate the next evening's
entertainment - a School
Disco.
Races were held in resort on
our last day. The morning was
an opportunity for anyone
interested in taking part and
seeing what a slalom course
was really like from up close.
This was open to boarders and
skiers of any ability and race
training was on hand too. In
the afternoon, we competed in
teams against other universi-
ties. Unfortunately our A team
and the boarder team were
knocked out in the first round,
but the B team kicked ass and
made it to the finals where we
were finally beaten by Bristol.
To celebrate, we took the last
lift up to the top of the moun-
tain where we enjoyed a few
Gluvein, before skiing or
boarding back to resort.
As it was our last night, we
made sure that it would be a
good one and partied in true
ski club style, until eventually,
one by one, we dropped from
either sheer exhaustion or
alcohol poisoning and headed
to bed for a couple of hours of
much needed kip.
