Hindu Society's SEWA
SEWA literally means "serv
ice" and that's exactly what •
IC Hindu Society d i d from
Friday 22nd February to
Friday 1st March. A s a team,
many members of our socie-
ty came together to help
raise money for SEWA inter-
national. A l l the H i n d u soci-
eties across the country
come together as part of a
national campaign w i t h 'The
National H i n d u Students
Forum'
SEWA International is a char-
ity group who have several
principle roles, which include:
• To relieve poverty, disease and help the
needy, the weak and those affected by
natural calamities, disasters and other
suffering.
• To educate and propagate and princi-
ples as enunciated in Hindu Dharma with
particular reference to serving the poor,
sick, needy and weak.
• To help in the education and training of
the poor, sick, disabled and socially back-
ward students and assist them financially.
Over this week, many of us took our
time to organise and participate in vari-
ous events, to help the victims of the vol-
cano eruption in Goma, Congo and help
those in Gujarat, India after the earth-
quake. The sheer variety of events was
enormous and included:
• Friday 22nd Feb - Wet Sponge throwing
- On a cloudy Friday lunchtime, Sunil Pala
and myself decided to get soaked to the
bone by various students oi -'
college, all in the name of charity,
as a warm-up start to Se
Week. After Sunil got dreriched,
yours truly had 2 buckets of cold
water poured over him, and got
sponges bashed in my face from j
all angles. It was great fun to
watch and to see me and Sunil
suffer (Ash and Jital, it will be
your turn next year).
• Sunday - Working in the IC
Soup Kitchen - we went with the
soup kitchen, in a packed
minibus, to Holborn and distrib-
uted sandwiches, hot drinks and
blankets to the homeless. It gave
us all a chance to understand the life
homeless people lead and the daily diffi-
culty of living on the streets of London.
The IC Community Action Group are
doing a wonderful job of helping the
homeless, and I urge you, as when you
can, to go and help them.
• Monday - Bollywood Film Night - For
this event, we managed to obtain a lec-
ture theatre, and we were able to show
the Oscar nominated film, Lagaan (which
is 4 hours long), which I'm sure we know
is all about the game of cricket! We had a
fairly good attendance, whilst Deepti and
Sheena slaved away at making some
amazing popcorn !
• Tuesday - Slave Auction - Trishul Darji
had some radical idea of organising a
slave auction, which was extremely lucra-
tive to many of us in the college. At
lunchtime, 10 members from both IC
fern I
Hindu and Indian societies, put
themselves up for auction in the
BMS Student Union room. The
stage w a s set and bidding
began. Upto £50 was bid for just
one person!! The total raised
from this event alone was a stag-
gering £270.
• Wednesday - 5-a-side football
tournament - Once again, a
cloudy day bleaked over Hyde
Park, yet this did not dampen our
hopes for a 5-a-side football tour-
nament. We had thirteen teams
from all over London, who com-
peted with all their might
against one another, to become
SEWA champions. IC Hindu Soc
lost their three games, but the fun of play-
ing in such a tournament was worth
every moment. The champions were a
mixture of the Sikh Society of Imperial
College and the City Guilds Squad, so our
congratulations to them. It was great that
teams from UCL, City and Q M W came
down to support the needs of SEWA.
• Thursday - Individual Events - Today,
we all decided to do something individu-
ally to raise money for SEWA. Many activ-
ities included a 24 hour silence, 24 hour
fast and 24 hour mobile free day.
However, the highlight was the painful
leg waxing of various members of Hindu
and Indian Society. Sunil, Nikhil, Anil and
Amardeep from SSC all got their legs
waxed by various members. Jital and
Pranati made the guys suffer by slowly
yet notoriously removing the wax. Some
of the guys were on the verge of crying
whilst others quoted
"Mummy" (Jital gave me the
quotes).
SEWA week was extreme-
ly successful, and we man-
aged to help raise a substan-
tial amount of money to help
these innocent victims. We
also had a great deal of fun in
seeing others suffer, all in
the name of charity: many of
us will not forget leg waxing
in particular. IC Hindu
Society would like to take
this opportunity to thank
everybody who participated
and donated for SEWA.
