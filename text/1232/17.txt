week this
Friday Weekend Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Easter Party
See adverts everywhere.
I think the main appeal
is that I'm going to be
there dressed as Hugh
Heffner. No? Oh, you
cruel, cruel people.
Union, Till Death Do Us...
I'm not sure
It's the weekend.
Hopefully you'll he
recovering from the
party last night. I know I
will be. Either that or in
a gutter somewhere.
Somewhere, Sometime
Tree House Building
Only joking. Hopefully
you'll be recovering from
the weekend. I know I
will be. Either that or in
a gutter somewhere. Ah,
pathos...
Somewhere Else, Or Not
Trivia
You, yes, you, yes, you,
yes, you, yes, you can
win a nice shiny 100
pound coin. Just for
being clever. Which you
know you are.
Da Vinci's, Early Evening
Go Home
It's the end of term. Stop
bugging me. I'm off for a
bath. I might even put
water in it this time.
Then I'm going to hiber-
nate for 4 weeks.

Union Upstairs, 7.45am
The Royal Tenenbaums
It's got Gene Hackman,
so it can't be truly horri-
ble, but I really have to
say I'm not too excited
at the prospect. It all
feels a little too A d a m
Sandler for me.
Peter Pan 2
Well I'm turning in my
grave, so I imagine that
Barrie is half way to
Australia using his own
form of drilling action by
now. Warning. This is
not a joke.
Collateral Damage
I'm sorry, but any film
called this is automati-
cally good. It just can't
be bad. See the bottom
row of the diary to
understand what I
mean. Boom!
Sex A n d Lucia
Oh dear. Basque Art
House. As in B A H . But it
might be semi-porno-
graphic by the sounds of
things. Maybe worth a
try. Sorry, I know: I'm an
uncultured cynic.
Kate and Leopold
Your girlfriend will love
it. Unless you're already
a girl, in which case you
can both go together.
That's both you and
your girlfriend. Go on,
just a little kiss. Please.

Classical Spectacular
Could be going out on a
limb here, but this
sounds like it might be
Pachelbel's Canon about
twelve times, and then
some Vivaldi. Hmmm...
Royal Albert Hall
Billy Bragg
Now I've heard of him,
but I can't remember
why, I think he's a come-
dian. I wish there was
someone I could ask. I
could try the 'net... Naw.
The Forum, Saturday
King Django
Any relation to Django
Reinhardt? If so, he'll be
swinging away on his
classical guitar. If not,
then I've got no idea, I'm
afraid. You could just go.
Underworld
System Of A D o w n
Angry, angry, young
men. This is going to be
an absolutely fantastic
gig. I can't advise you
enough to go. Did I men-
tion it's sold out?
Brixton Academy
Leaves
As in make like a tree
and... We can only wish,
I suspect. The fact that
they are playing at this
venue too, well... it's in
Camden...
