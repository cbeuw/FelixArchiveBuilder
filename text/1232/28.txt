A n d now the end is near... This is it Fudgepackers; the culmination of all
those months of reading this bollocks and attempting the crossword. I'll
put this weeks efforts with the others in the tombola and announce the
winner of the PS2 in the first issue of next term. Answers will be accept-
ed until the final day of term but after that you can kiss my hariy yellow
butt. There'll still be crosswords next term of course, but they will only
be for 'fun'. Last week's winner is Tom Wegelius, well done good buddy.
Next year there'll be more prizes and more features appearing in the
wonderful coffee break section. Until next time Fudgepackers, live the
dream.... Dr. Hot Fudge
