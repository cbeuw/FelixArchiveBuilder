Yes it is definitely on and it will be big-
ger and better than last year. So now we
have cleared that up a few more ques-
tions...
What is a Summer Ball?
Well other than state the obvious (rumour
has it that Imperial contains intelligent
people!), it is an opportunity for over 1,500
students to get together, dress up and
have a good time. This year's extravagan-
za will be the biggest ever held in college.
So w h e n is it happening?
On June 8, the Imperial College grounds
will be transformed into a top class enter-
tainment venue that will include an out-
door stage on the Queen's Lawn, as well
as a fairground and a number of indoor
dance arenas.

complaining that its smack bang in the
middle of your exams this date has been
chosen because it's the only time that
there are no exams on a Friday near the
Queens Lawn. One disadvantage of
bringing a massive stage onto the
Queens Lawn means that it takes a day to
set up and results in a lot of noise.
All I can say is that you now know the
date ages in advance and it might be a
good time to take a day off working and
use the Summer Ball as a break.
What will I be able to do?
Last year's entertainments included a
fairground, numerous bars and the James
Taylor Quartet. We are going to stick with
a similar successful formula but expect
things to be even better this year. More
information will be released closer to the
time.

So now that I want to go, how m u c h
will it cost me?
To transform college into a venue suitable
for the ball costs a fair bit of money (sur-
prising I know, as most people I speak to
think college epitomises the ultimate
party atmosphere), however college have
generously donated £20,000 so that the
ball can go ahead. Given this donation the
tickets will be sold at the same price as
last year £25 for the evening's entertain-
ments and £50 for a formal dinner plus all
the entertainments.

So all you need to remember now is the

involved or have ideas for the event then
