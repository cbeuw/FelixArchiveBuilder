Easter Egg Reviews
i s * * •::,
Flake •
More standard fayre from
Cadbury's - "creamy but not
so rich." The egg had a pretty
picture of a chicken on it,
though. Unsurprisingly, we
got two whole bars of Flake
with our egg w h i c h was
"woman seducingly nice",
apparently.
KitKat •
The egg itself was generally
found to have an unpleasant
powdery texture, " a bit like
cotton wool" remarked one
taster. The bonus here was
two KitKat Chunky bars. One
of the team noted that "it'd
really piss off the NUS" by
featuring a Nestle product.
Snickers
This got a luke-warm
response from our team who
thought it rather average, if
"a bit sweet." As a bonus,
you get two Snickers bars.
"They were... well, Snickers
bars" and "I hate peanuts"
commented the team, but
they liked the football theme.
•A Organic Dark
"Tastes like a cocktail of rub-
ber dissolved ia WD40" wrote
one of Jtl rig team.
"Nasty /wrtaste" id "the
most disgusting thing I have
ever put in mjr mouth" were
also included in the reports.
There was no bonus gift at
all, either.

Quality Street
The chocolate had a pleasant,
nutty aftertaste, with uninter-
esting crenellations on the
egg itself. Quality Street dis-
tinguished themselves by
including their bonus gift
inside the egg - the only egg
so far to have done so - giving
us a selection of chocolates.
Rolo •
The egg didn't go down well
with our team: "Bleugh",
"boring" and "too thin"
described the chocolate from
the egg. As the bonus, we got
some Rolos, unexpectedly we
thought. "The only nice Rolo
is the last one" summed up
the team's reaction.
M i n i Eggs •
The chocolate was Cadbury's
yet again, but "creamy" and
"milky" as it was, one panel
member was getting "very
bored with that damn chick-
en" embossed on the surface
of the egg. A "nice big bag"
of Mini Eggs was included,
though.
A Celebrations
"Creamy and delightful" was
one description of this thickly
built egg. The bonus here
was some miniature bars, dis-
appointingly not wrapped
inside the egg. "Too many
bloody Snickers" expressed
the team's response to the lit-
tle chocolates.
A Dairy Milk
Some dischord in our tasting
panel, declaring it "bland"
while others claimed that
"you can't beat it!" The egg
was a little samey - it even
had the same picture of a
chicken on it - but most wel-
comed the chance to get rid of
the Organic Dark taste!

A After Eight
This egg received sponta-
neous applause as it was
brought to the tasting table.
The egg was "minty and nice-
ly bitter", but one member
usefully observed that it "did-
n't go well with Bacardi
Breezers." A generous box of
wafer mints was included.
