Council Were Efficient
The most efficient meeting of
Union Council this year took
place on Thursday, w h i c h
finally resolved debate over
the new constitution and con-
troversy about the recent sab-
batical elections.
The U n i o n Exists
The sabbatical team and
Union Council have spent
much of the recent months
writing and approving a n e w
constitution, which will bring
the Union in line w i t h
College's new faculty struc-
ture.
Discussion of this paper,
which must be passed by two
consecutive Council meetings,
has lasted hours in the past
but on this occasion was ham-
pered by only two points. The
first objection related to the
departmental representatives'
place on Council, while the
second proved more unusual,
when Mustafa Arif, President
of the City & Guilds
Constituent College Union,
proposed an amendment to
abolish the body of Council
itself. The idea was to replace
Council meetings with larger
student general meetings,
which would be attended by
more 'non-hack' students.
However, many argued that
there would be persistent fail-
ure to get anything done due
to suspected low turnout.
Eventually, Council failed to
self-destruct along the lines of
the Royal College of Science
Union, and declined to pass
Mr Arif's amendment.
The new constitution and
regulations now have only to
get College's final approval
before coming into full effect
at the beginning of the next
academic year.
Elections Again
The Committee in charge of
this year's sabbatical elec-
tions also submitted their final
report to Council.
Complaints made by M s
Munir (see Felix 1131) had
been previously overturned by
a very close margin at Union
Executive, but they did not
make their expected re-
appearance at Council, when
she decided not to appeal the
decision. There was some con-
sternation when a Council
member pointed out that Wye
students had not been given
two days' voting, but after a
brief break, Council heard that
no complaint had been intend-
ed and the report was passed.
It now looks far less likely
that any complaints will over-
turn the election results, and
as such they will become fixed
on Monday.
