Chaplaincy - The Eden Project
Over the weekend, of 1-3 March the
Chaplaincy Centre organised a visit to the
Eden Project in Cornwall. It w a s also a
chance to reflect upon related questions.
These included personal and community
responses to global environmental
threats; different perceptions of nature;
and the contemporary use of the texts
and images of creation.
Gillian Straine, a post-graduate study-
ing atmospheric physics, offers her reac-
tions to the latest environmental and
engineering wonder of the world.
"The Eden Project is without a doubt a
fantastic conception, built in what would
have been an ugly quarry pit. There are
two huge Martian bio-domes, with a
Tracy island type construction straddling
them containing the essential restaurant
and gift shop. The whole place seemingly
operates on uncommonly good ethics.
The guide says they embrace the ideas
and outlook of the young but, says the
cynic, has the wisdom of the old been
taken into consideration? Leaving aside
the nightmare of Jurassic Park chaos of
man being destroyed by his creation, can
it really work? Inside both the domes, the
plant life of different regions of our planet
are displayed side by side. The paying
customer can amble through the tropics
of South America before heading past
humidifiers to the tropics of the Pacific
and on into Africa.
The array of plants is stunning. The his-
tory of the plants and our use of them are
clearly displayed. It is a living, working
experiment having only been opened for
one year. But can it work?
In my research I use computer models
to simulate the atmosphere of Earth. Yet
for all the computing power we can't
come close to recreating our weather and
climate. We end up making large assump-
tions and achieve a rough idea, the sys-
tem being so complex. So, again, can the
Eden project work?
Insects aren't welcome so some of the
plants have to be artificially pollinated.
A n d of course, there isn't any weather in
the domes so they have to get the hoses
out and create a monsoon at the right
time. For many species the flowering sea-
son is extended for the visitors.
Our guide told us she was nearly hit by
a falling tree that had not formed roots.
They hadn't got a dud plant, or the wrong
soil. There was just no wind to shake the
tree enough for it to have to form them.
A n d that is probably only the tip of the
iceberg.
You can recreate the right temperature
and you can get the native plants but
with so much that you can't get the sys-
tem will start to diverge from reality. Not
that we won't learn a great deal on the
way. I praise Eden and think we need
more exciting ambitious projects where
the ways of the past are challenged. But
as for recreating such a complex beast as
our planet's whole diverse flora environ-
ment in two greenhouses, it just can't be
that easy."
