It was a cold Friday night in late No-
vember when a group of six sailors
headed to Cardiff to compete in the
Cardiff Dragon team racing event. As
planned, Chris and Martin had got the
coach earlier while I was to go home and
meet the others at the Union for 18:00.
Unfortunately I left it a bit late so didn’t
get to the Union till gone 19:00. The
others piled in while berating me for my
lateness and, with some trepidation, we
headed for Cardiff. Our fear was not un-
justified as this was forecast to be one
of the coldest weekends of the year. As
we headed off, the radio reported wide-
spread ice on the roads, that Cardiff
airport was closed due to snow and that
there were 26 mile queues on the M4
into Cardiff.
Considering this, our journey went
surprising smoothly. Once we got out
of the standard London evening traf-
fic it was smooth driving all the way to
Wales with only a brief stop for food.
Near Cardiff the roads were still clear,
with the forecast traffic not materialis-
ing, and while we were slowed slightly
by fog we made good time and arrived at
about 22:30. After a minor navigational
error took us into an industrial estate,
we found our way to host’s house and
rejoined the other members of the team.
Saturday morning soon arrived and we
headed off to the sailing club. This was
more of a challenge than it may sound
as we had to fit six sailors and all their
gear into my rather small car. However
we managed and soon arrived at the
club to find people rigging boats in the
snow. Once this was done, we quickly
headed into the warmth to wait for the
briefing. However our wait was soon
interrupted by one of the Cardiff sailors
asking if anyone had jump leads as one
of their motorboats had a flat battery.
Surprisingly I did, so lent them mine,
highly reassured by the high level of or-
ganisation, or maybe not. Eventually the
briefing did occur and after some more
faffing the racing began by about 11:30,
only two hours late!
Team racing involves races between
two teams of three boats. In each race
you score a number of points equal to
your position and the team with the low-
est total score wins. This results in in-
tense racing as you must use the rules to
help your team. If you come 1st but your
team mates are 5th and 6th you still lose.
On Saturday the weather was quite
windy as demonstrated by our great and
glorious commodore Chris who cap-
sized before the beginning of the first
race. Not fun in sub-zero temperatures.
Our first race started well with a good
start. One of the other teams was holding
Chris up, preventing him from heading
to the 1st mark, so I went to cover him
allowing Chris to escape. Unfortunately
Chris messed this up and did a rather
dodgy move which, if I was on the other
team, would have protested. They did
not, but Chris promptly went and cap-
sized again. Smooth. Fortunately Fiona
and I were able to get a 1-2 to win the
race anyway. In our next race, we again
got a good start and while the opposition
had 1st we had 2-3-4 and were able to
hold on to get our second win.
After a short break we were back out
and feeling pretty confident although
we knew we would need to do well to
beat Exeter, our next opposition, who
were one of the better teams at the
event. Unfortunately this was not to be
as a poor start gave them 1-2 around
the first mark and we were not able to
recover. Next up was Reading, a team
we thought were of a similar standard
to us. Again we did not get a great start
but coming up to the first mark Chris
was 2nd and I was 3rd. The 1st Read-
ing boat was holding us up trying to get
