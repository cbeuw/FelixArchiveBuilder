FELIX 25
We took the wrong route down. With great care
(and ice axes) we ensured our survival on the
shear slope – at times one just had to hope that
a foot that slipped would miraculously find an-
other rock. But the amazing views stayed with
us and kept our spirits high as we all made it
safely to the bottom.
On returning to the hut, a glorious Christmas
dinner was had, with two types of gravy and
enough stuffing for 5,000. The Secret Santa
gifts followed and all were appreciated, espe-
cially the shoes, ale, cheesecake and selection
of cream buns. All warmed with the roaring fire
and after a second application of books and ale,
we went to bed.
Da y th e Fourth:
Amazing Blencathra Views
The last day was perhaps the most enjoyable.
We woke early and made our way to one of
the most northerly Lake District mountains –
Blencathra. We ascented the peak steadily and
the spectacular views were complimented ser-
endipitously by the rising sun. At the summit
the clear skies allowed us 360° views of the
surrounding landscape; it was breathtakingly
beautiful.
We made our quick descent, walking along
snow-covered fields back to the bus. Looking
back at the heights that we had conquered, it
was generally agreed that it had been a success-
ful Fellwanderers Trip.
Get involved!
Fellwanderers run regu-
lar weekend trips to the
spectacular mountain
ranges across Britain,
catering for all abili-
ties. To get involved just

on the next trip!
“The warm, steep
ascent lead us to
a beautiful scene
of crystal clear
skies to the west
where we could
see the coast”
utiful scenery, gorgeous sunshine or even a bloody group photo. What could you possibly be phoning someone about at a moment like this?!?!?
I wonder what would happen if they lost that Fellwanderers banner? Would they be allowed to go on trips?
