moment.
When one is King, one cannot afford to
do a lot of things. For example it will
be frowned upon if one is interested
in marrying an American (shock hor-
ror) twice-divorced woman in a time of
conservative, proper ideals. Caught up
in this scandal, King David VIII (Guy
Pearce), decides to follow his heart and
abdicate the throne, leaving the crown
to fall on his brother’s head, George
(Colin Firth), or Bertie, as he’s known
to his family. But this is not going to be
a smooth transition either, for George
has difficulties of his own; he stam-
mers and is incapable of public speak-
ing. Yet another thing one cannot af-
ford to do when one wishes to be King.
After an embarrassing public incident,
he is seen by a myriad of speech thera-
pists and what ensues is a hilarious My
Fair Lady-like routine where Bertie is
required to put seven marbles in his
mouth to speak – apparently helping
him to pronounce correctly. Also, he is
advised to smoke – because it “relaxes”
the lungs.
Bertie tries hard, but nothing seems
to work – his wife Elizabeth (Helena
Bonham Carter) supports her husband
no matter what in the most dignified,
sweet manner but she is also of course
worried for the days ahead. It is not un-
As another year begins again and starts
us off right at the beginning of Oscar
season, the Felix Film writers take a
look back at the best of cinema in 2010
– in case you were in some kind of year-
long coma – and discuss some of our
most anticipated films of 2011.
There are three clear frontrunners
for the top films in 2010 that spring to
mind, and probably fall into most Best
Of 2010 lists without question. As the
first big budget movie to treat its audi-
ence like intelligent members of society,
Inception fully delivered on its incred-
ible hype, storming the box office with
its stylish, mind-boggling, high-concept
action and sealing Christopher Nolan’s
reputation as one of the great directors
of his generation.
Another film that somehow man-
aged to meet – even exceed – expecta-
tions, was Toy Story 3,
which rounded off
possibly the best
trilogy since The
Godfather with a
wonderful narrative
and family fun film
that set both crit-
ics and movie-goers
worldwide
going
wild.
Rounding off an excellent year, Aaron
Sorkin’s impeccably scripted The So-
cial Network has helped fuel the debate
about why 26 year old billionaires – in
this case, brilliantly portrayed by Jesse
Eisenberg – have to be rude, often mali-
cious people. Its razor-sharp, ultra-witty
writing makes it a very likely candidate
for the Best Original Screenplay gong,
though this may yet be snatched away
from Sorkin by this year’s early films
such as The King’s Speech.
This year is full of exciting films, and
we’re not just talking about the final in-
stallment in the Harry Potter franchise
that could easily prove to be the most
profitable film of the year. Among the
most publicised films, we have a lot
to look forwards to with Cowboys vs
Aliens – watch the trailer now; Tintin
– with the versatile Andy Serkis as Cap-
tain Haddock; and Tinker, Tailor, Sol-
dier, Spy – how can you resist another
Colin Firth film this year? Undoubt-
edly, however, one of the most keenly
anticipated films are Danny Boyle’s 127
Hours, which is out now starring James
Franco – a name we will be hearing a lot
this year; and another from The Wrestler
director Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan,
which takes a dark dive into the mys-
terious world of ballet starring Nathalie
Portman and Mila Kunis (inset). With
the Oscars just weeks away, it’s
time to catch the best of the
film season whilst you can,
and start placing your bets.
til hope arrives – in the form of an Aus-
tralian speech therapist Lionel Logue
(Geoffrey Rush) with unorthodox and
controversial teaching methods – that
the film really hits its stride. What
then develops between Firth and Rush
is one of the best on-screen bromance
pairs in recent years between the two
unlikeliest people: a tongue-tied, nerv-
ous, upper-class King, and a confident,
eccentric speech therapist. The film
reaches its climax as Bertie is faced
with the ultimate challenge – Hitler in-
vading Poland – and England looks to
unite behind a strong and inspirational
figurehead. As the pressure starts to
build, the role of the speech therapist
becomes more crucial, as Bertie begins
to rely on Logue more.
It’s a moving, albeit predictable, story
of human triumph: the film’s events
have been carefully orchestrated to act
as a build-up to the speech that Bertie
will inevitably have to deliver. When it
counts, the film can easily convey the
stirring impact it was supposed to bring
in the grand finale. It finishes as a feel-
good film but remains upbeat through-
out, focusing on the fun and somewhat
unnatural relationship between Firth and
Rush. The smart screenplay that turns
a historical sequence of events into an
appealing mix of drama and outstanding
humour keeps things fresh and easy to
fully enjoy and comprehend.
As an actor, Firth is given the entire
film to show off and takes advantage of
every single moment. With such a ver-
bally incompetent character to portray,
Firth still manages to convey a range of
emotions without words, commanding
the screen with his masterful portrayal.
Rush’s character is not overlooked here
either, depicting a failed actor who, us-
ing his self-assured methods and pecu-
liar charm, helps people to speak. He is
delightfully odd and comically patronis-
ing but when it counts, a loyal friend.
The warmth the two actors share is
touching stuff, even without the help of
a big orchestral score.
In a similar vein to The Queen, which
saw Helen Mirren’s performances win-
ning rave reviews and virtually every
single acting award in existence, The
King’s Speech is a film that is more
concerned about the performances of
its actors and its period mood. Glory
and high praise has already started to
be heaped onto to Firth, tipped by some
to be the film that’ll win Firth his first
Oscar, but the film itself is not ground-
breaking. It’s a rousing, heart-warming
period drama – one of the most skill-
fully executed one of its kind – but it’s
truly the performances that steal the
show.
Happy New Year?
After last term’s successful return of iCU
Cinema, the club are looking to extend
their reaches – showing two films twice
a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
This all kicks off with Tron: Legacy and
Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the
Dawn Treader which starts at 6.30pm on
Tuesday 18th January, switching the or-
der of the bill for the 6.30pm showing on
Thursday 20th.
Once again, the ticket prices are stay-
ing within the student budget (i.e. the
price of a pint in London) with mem-
bers prices being £4 for a single film
and £7 for the double bill. Membership
is still staying at £3 for the year includ-
ing a free film, so it’s definitely worth
buying online to save that extra pound
every week. In addition to this, iCU
Cinema is bringing out its new loyalty
card that rewards its regulars with every
sixth film free – not a bad deal consid-
ering the line-up they’re looking to put
on this year.
Kicking off with the visually stun-
ning revisit to the 80’s classic, Tron:
Legacy is set to be followed up in the
weeks to come by Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows: Part One for all those
who missed it last month (scandalous!),
Oscar-tipped British film The King’s
Speech, and Danny Boyle’s 127 Hours.
Last term’s revival of the All-Nighter
is expected to be repeated with an even
more impressive line-up, rumoured to
include Black Swan, Blue Valentine and
the Coen’s brothers’ latest True Grit.
iCU Cinema is now available to be
followed on Twitter (@icu_cinema) for
film updates and recommendations of
what Imperial students want to see on
the big screen.
