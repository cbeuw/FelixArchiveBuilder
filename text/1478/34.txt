misinformed robot
Peri0ds are like when girls are g0 all men-
tal because they’re l0sing bl00d and start
hallucinating. They call it girl pr0blems and
can use it t0 get 0ut 0f any difficult situa-
ti0n like d0ing the c00king 0r using a c0m-
puter. It happens 0nce a m0nth but girls
can make it last f0r at least tw0 weeks
and s0metimes they will say they are hav-
ing 0ne but when actually they are actually
n0t. The 0nly way t0 check they are n0t
lying is t0 use a calendar and rec0rd every
time they say they are 0n having peri0d.
Then y0u can find the discrepenancies.
There is an0ther way t0 check if a girl are
having a peri0ds but y0u will pr0bably g0
t0 jail f0r at least a very l0ng time. The
best thing t0 d0 is sh00t yourself in the
artery s0 that y0u are l0se bl00d as well
but faster and then they cann0t c0mplain.
Make sure y0u hide y0ur calender.

THAT TIME OF THE MONTH...
Merry Grohlmas!!!
As I was so coldly left out of the loop by
the Fuhrer last term, who didn’t bother
to mention that there wasn’t going to be
another issue of Felix before the Christ-
mas holidays and thus left you without a
jolly festive Hangman, I’ve had to take
matters into my own hands and create a
religious festival for the 14th of January.
After some rummaging around on the
internet, I discovered that Dave Grohl
was born on the 14th of January. Now
I’m not a big Dave Grohl fan, but he does
bare some resemblance to Jesus, and the
only other option was Carl Weathers,
who already has his own religion, ‘Carl
Weathersism’.
The History of Grohlmas
Just like Christmas, Grohlmas has an
equally exciting and implausible nativity
story. It is important for everyone to
remember why they’re celebrating
Grohlmas and understand where it came
from.
The Nativity Story
Dave Grohl was born onto a drum kit. His
Mother, Davina Grohl, was the drummer
for the trance-funk hippy band, Spaced
Out on Bass, and didn’t even notice her
water break as she performed at a gig in
Ohio. In fact the vibrations from the bass
drum were so intense that she had fully
dilated within ten minutes and baby Dav-
ey just plopped out onto the foot pedal.
Legend has it that Davina Grohl passed
out from blood loss and a cocktail
of hallucinogen- ics, leaving
her new-born to complete
the remaining set. The
band’s guitar- ist, Jed
Von Glacier, cut the
umbilical cord with the blade from one
of his iconic ice skates and then handed
Dave the drumsticks. Dave stole the
show and the rest is history.
The rest of the history
“Hey Kurt Cobain’’, Nirvana, “ Bye Kurt
Cobain’’, Foo Fighters. DONE.
Grohlmas Traditions
Blaming everything on Courtney Love.
Some people use festive holidays as a
chance to appreciate all the good things
in life. Grohlmas takes the opposite ap-
proach and encourages looking at all the
bad things in life and then blaming them
on Courtney Love. This is where the pop-
ular phrase, ‘Oh for fuck’s sake Courtney
Love, this is all your fault you repulsive
slut!’ originated from.
Badass presents.
The word ‘badass’ makes you instantly
think of the Grohl. It’s not surprising
when you look at his track record of
drugs, prison and killing Tupac. To cel-
ebrate this people give and receive badass
presents. These include rabid animals,
angryAfrican children with machetes and
the album ‘My Words’ by Justin Bieber.
The Queen’s rendition of ‘All my life’
And of course, every year we settle down
with the TV to watch classic Grohlmas
films (National Lampoon’s Grohlmas
vacation, A muppet’s Grohlmas carol and
The Sound of Dave Grohl) followed by
The Queen’s warbling covers of some
Foo Fighters classics. She may be old,
but she sure knows how to play guitar.
And if you think this is getting a bit too
ridiculous, go read the fucking nativity
story in the bible.
Do you know
how humiliating
it is for me, an
Oxford graduate
sentence, to
be squeezed in
here? Look at
all the crap that
I’m surrounded
by. My mother
thinks I work
for the Times...
*sigh
