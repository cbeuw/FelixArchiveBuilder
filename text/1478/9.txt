...established by Imperial’s Strategic
Education Committee, which exists
without student representation.
At the first meeting on Monday 17th
January, chaired by the Deputy Princi-
pal of Imperial College Business School,
Professor Dorothy Griffiths, various pro-
posals will be presented but no firm deci-
sions will be made towards future plans.
As well as the idea of reducing the
lunch break, other proposals due to be
discussed at the meeting include extend-
ing postgraduate hours to 8pm on Mon-
days and Thursdays, extending under-
graduate hours to 8am-7pm on Mondays
and Thursdays and offering humanities
options from 6pm-8pm on a voluntary
basis.
The proposals are aimed at depart-
ments suffering from timetabling issues
and are designed to provide greater flex-
ibility in terms of teaching.
When asked about the potential rami-
fications of the committee’s conclu-
sions, Professor Buckingham provided
her opinion on who would be affected
should any changes come to pass: “I
wouldn’t want to predict the final out-
come but I would expect any changes to
be aimed mainly at Master’s students.

VAT rise hits prices in
FiveSixEight
Spendthrift students returning from their
Christmas break might have noticed a
subtle shift in the cost of food and drink
around campus. The recent rise in the
rate of VAT has been cited as the main
driver of the cost increase, although oth-
er pressures – including an increase in
fuel duty, also put into place this month
– have contributed to the mounting fi-
nancial pressure.
The Director of Commercial Services,
Jane Neary, initially suggested that stu-
dent prices would not be affected, say-
ing: “The VAT won’t affect the student
prices.” When challenged she explained
that “a few product prices may have
been very slightly affected” by the ap-
plication of the VAT increase on visitor
prices. Although student purchases on
campus are not subject to VAT – hence
the swipe card discount – Mrs. Neary
told Felix, “because of the link between
the [student and visitor/staff] prices on
the system, we’ve had to round up or
down certain student prices.”
The prices of popular food and non-
alcoholic drink items show both small
percentage increases and decreases.
Prices on average have seen an increase
of 0.5%.
Prices at the Union have risen more
significantly. Lagers have gone up by
around 10p, a 5% increase on last term;
the price of spirits has increased by 20p
on average, up 10%; soft drinks have
seen an increase of 5p. Peanuts have
risen by 50% from 50p to 75p.
A Union spokesperson told Felix that
the reason the increase in price on cer-
tain items was larger than the rise in
VAT was due to a number of factors, in-
cluding other price pressures. There was
a need “to apply a 3% increase” unre-
lated to VAT at the start of the academic
year but the Union had held back that
increase to “avoid changing prices twice
during the same academic year.”
The spokesperson went on to say that
This week sees the launch of the Nation-
al Student Survey (NSS) 2011 at most
Higher and Further education institu-
tions across the UK, including Imperial.
Entering its seventh year, the NSS is
intended to provide the opportunity for
final year students to reflect on their time
at their institution and voice their opin-
ions on their course.
The survey results feature in numer-
ous university league tables. The In-
dependent, Sunday Times, and Times
all use it to determine student satisfac-
tion, whilst the Guardian employs it for
teaching quality.
Last year, Imperial College London
achieved an overall satisfaction rating of
85%, placing it 43rd nationally and 13th
amongst Russell Group universities.
The college’s learning resources rating
of 90% was well above the national av-
erage.
However, student satisfaction with as-
sessment and feedback was distinctly
sub-par. Prof Julia Buckingham, Pro
Rector (Education), stated at the time
“It is an issue we are taking seriously,
and are continuing to address. With
the Union “was prepared to incur the
cost [of the VAT increase] in certain cir-
cumstances”. For example, in maintain-
ing “the Wednesday night offer of £1.50
a pint and all week long £2.00 for a pint
of Becks or IPA.”
Regarding the large jump in the price
of peanuts and crisps, the spokesperson
said that the Union had previously been
selling these items at “below the normal
profit margin”, in part to compensate for
“the [previous] lack of facilities to sup-
ply [high-quality] food.”
The raising of VAT from 17.5% to
20% has been the subject of serious
controversy. A recent survey revealed
fears amongst senior managers that re-
tailers will use the confusion of the tax
hike to mask the raising of their prices
well beyond the VAT rate, while opposi-
tion leader Ed Miliband branded the rise
as the “wrong tax at the wrong time.”
George Osborne, the Chancellor, main-
tained that the rise was the most “pro-
gressive” option available.
National Student Survey
launched
that in mind I’m delighted the Rector
has placed assessment and feedback
high on his agenda. He has written to
heads of departments and directors of
undergraduate studies, asking them to
make this a priority, and requesting that
departments lay down clear timelines
indicating when students can expect
feedback for work submitted.” The Rec-
tor embarked on an ambitious drive to
improve standards, setting departments
a two-week deadline for marking and
returning work.
Following these exertions, the col-
lege will be hoping for a whopping
improvement on last year’s results al-
though it is widely expected that the re-
sults for the Biology and Biochemistry
courses will take a hit following wide-
spread student discontent with the Life
Sciences cuts.
All eligible students are encouraged to
take part – higher turnout rate resulting
in more credible data. If participation is
less than 50%, the NSS will not accept
the results. The question of whether last
year’s situation has been improved upon
will be answered when the results are
published in August 2011.

Earlier starts, later lectures and
shorter lunch breaks on the cards
One important steer the group have been
given is that the length of the teaching
day for individual students should not be
increased.”
Deputy President (Education) Alex
Dahinten recognised the “historical”
problem that departments have had with
timetable clashes, but he highlighted the
effects that extending the day could have
on college life: “Potentially extending
the College Day comes with serious
side effects such as Club & Society or
Sports events having to be put on later
in the evening, putting off students from
Navid Nabijou
taking humanities as well as generally
exhausting students by putting them
through a very long day of studies.”
He reassured Felix that students would
be involved and would be able to put
forward their views: “Student reps have
been consulted, and students can be as-
sured that every issue will be presented
at the meeting by the [Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones] and
myself. I have been guaranteed that the
student experience is at the forefront of
this discussion, and the Union will make
sure that this is the case.”

VAT explained
VAT (value added tax)
rose from 17.5% to
20% on January 4th.
It is applied to all
‘luxury’ items bought
and sold. Certain
products such as
food or children’s
clothing are exempt.
Famously, Jaffa
Cakes were ruled
VAT exempt because
they were shown to
be cakes (which are
VAT exempt) instead
of biscuits.
The effect on pric-
es around campus
is small because
your purchases are
VAT-exempt (that dis-
count you get with
your swipe card) due
to the university’s
status as a charity.
However, there will
be noticable changes
in prices at the Union
bars, though the
sacrosant ‘£2 pint’
has been protected.
