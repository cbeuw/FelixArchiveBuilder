Medical school embarrassed by
controversial Daily Mail article
In an unpromising start to the New
Year, the reputation of Imperial College
School of Medicine was brought into
disrepute by a scathing article published
in the Daily Mail.
A no-holds-barred account of a recent
Katherine Bettany Sports Night at the Reynolds bar – home
to the medics – featured in the article,
complete with several less-than-compli-
mentary pictures of students. The report
spoke of “outrageous drinking games”,
students who “exposed themselves to

They are supposed to be fun, and the stu-
dent union have no intention of trying to
curb your enjoyment. We recognise that
there is a good chance of people vomit-
ing on Wednesday night and so provide
orange buckets for this purpose.”

lege committee is considering lengthen-
ing the academic day in order to ensure
that Imperial is able to “accommodate
the growing number of master’s courses
and extracurricular programmes [that it]
offers.” The proposals being discussed
include allowing teaching during the
current lunch break by reducing it to
one hour.
Pro-Rector (Education and Academic
Affairs) Professor Julia Buckingham
confirmed the plans to Felix, explaining
that, “there is a committee looking at the
ways that we can use our teaching space
most effectively”.
The committee charged with inves-
tigating the possible courses of action,
known as a “working group on the ex-
tension of the College Day”, was...
