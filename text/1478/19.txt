COMMENT
C
hristmas has now come
and gone, hopefully ful-
filling its promise as a
time of goodwill to all
people. According to A
Christmas Carol, it is a time when rich
people should have been kind and gen-
erous to the poor as, statistically at least;
many of them are people too!
But social contact and friendly manner
is, like, so pre-internet. Luckily we have
The Christmas Sales™ (TCS) instead
to act as a once-yearly border crossing
between the tiers of society, without the
need for anything as embarrassing as
talking with posh folk or as potentially
disease-catching as mixing with the
poor. Boxing day is for (wo)men of all
colours, creed and class to queue up as
equals; equally desperate for deals and,
suddenly, equally able to afford them.
Indeed, if A Christmas Carol was set
nowadays Tiny Tim would never have
the chance to die from hunger and sick-
liness. He’d die from being an over-fed
fatso gagging on all the cut-price mince
pies selling like hot-cakes (also on offer)
in Sainsbury’s after chrimbo. He prob-
ably wouldn’t even be called ‘Tiny’ as
Rhys Davies
there’s only so much irony allowed on
tombstones. But he’d die happy, gorging
on the finest Taste the Difference pies
and loving every morsel of difference
he tasted.
Oh Truck-like Tim how I can relate
to thee! Are there any greater joys of a
modern existence than stumbling across
top deals in the Reduced Price food sec-
tion of a supermarket? And unlike the
short-lived high of TCS™, it is a pleas-
ure that remains throughout the year:
Cheap offers are for life, not just for
Christmas.
But some people are blind to the power
of those small yellow labels, taking just
a cursory look at what is on offer and,
worse; only looking out for the random
freak occurrence that something on their
usual shopping list has been reduced.
This is the grocery equivalent of being
offered cut-price flights to Fiji, but leav-
ing them because they aren’t ‘Costa Del
Sol like you’re used to’.
Instead, one should appreciate that
humble reduction-sticker-gun for what it
really is, a hole-punch for social groups,
creating little portals through which drop
reduced-price consumables from en-
tirely different lives. I would never have
tried Irish Soda Bread if I had not seen
it stickered in a Sainsbury’s aisle, nor
Potato Farls if I hadn’t spied them cheap
in Tesco. I’d never have ponced about
like some chocolate aficionado whilst
munching on my Gü torte, nor would I
have been sorely disappointed by those
trendy Covent Garden soups that had
always tempted me with their homely,
wholesome packaging. Bizarre bakery
blooms, gluten-free peanut squares or
soya milk chocolate milkshakes, all have
been little tastes of other price-ranges,
lands or incurable chronic bowel condi-
tions. Each one allows me a little bit of
role play, whether stepping into the shoes
of a Ryvita–buying yummy mummy or
the (frankly tasteless) microwave crab
ready meal of some time-pressed urban
yuppie. Each one has been a culinary
education and often, a pleasant surprise.
Do not be disheartened this year if you
don’t get that jacket you wanted in the
TCS™. All year round we are blessed
by big corporations and a Santa’s sack
load of gifts and goodies for us little
people.
Thank you Tesco.
H
appy New Year to you
all! It’s nice to know that,
as a species, we’ve man-
aged to make it through
another year without de-
stroying ourselves. Well done.
There can be no doubt now that we are
living in the future. We have, by some
people’s (anachronistic) standards, su-
percomputers that we can carry in our
pockets; for food, we have nutritious
and delicious meals that can be recon-
stituted in an instant; for entertainment,
we can watch programmes in greater
resolutions and in more dimensions than
exist in real life.
But there’s still one thing I want to
know: Where’s my jet–pack?
This is most definitely the future.
We’re ten years from a Space Odyssey
and fourteen years on from when Skynet
took over the world (that was a particu-
larly bad day). We are currently living in
the middle of a science–fiction writer’s
fantasies. So why doesn’t it feel like the
future?
I think it’s partly due to the past/pre-
sent only becoming the future very in-
sidiously, creeping up so slowly that we
don’t notice. We’re surrounded by so
many amazing innovations and inven-
tions that arrived so gradually we don’t
realise how amazing they actually are.

But this doesn’t feel like the future
because we’re also missing some essen-
tials. We have lasers, sure, but they’ve
yet to trickle down to the man on the
street, and just where are the robots?! I
can see how these things could be used
for less–than–benign purposes and with
humanity’s collective propensity to, as
Gandhi put it, be a dick – something, I
fear, that won’t change in 2011 – I think
we might be better off without them for
the time being.
But jet–packs are all right. In fact,
they’re better than all right, they’re re-
ally cool! Admit it. Who hasn’t dreamt
of flying through the skies like a bird,
laughing at the puny mortals down be-
low? Mwahaha!
Megalomania aside, they would offer
yet another mode to commute to col-
lege – this would be especially pertinent
when the Tube goes on strike... again.
Perhaps most important of all, the skies
are the one place you are guaranteed to
be safe from the commuter’s deadliest
predator, the leopards.
Without jet-packs, we might as well
be living in the past, which from the fu-
ture’s perspective is the present, where
most people think we’re living already.
Such a shame, but who knows – maybe
2011 will be the year of the jet–pack?
I can only dream.
I
would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to respond to Jamie Henry’s
response to one of my letters last
term. Mr Henry was upset by some of
my remarks on the St. John Ambulance.
He found my remarks to be in poor hu-
mour and I’m sorry that he thinks that.
But that letter, as is most of what I
write, was intended to be humorous. It is
impossible to amuse all the people all of
the time and I apologise if I have missed
a beat, as it were.
However, I will reiterate the tone of
that letter, one I feel I made transpar-
ently clear, that the SJA do provide a
fantastic service and, as a keen run-
ner for charity, I am grateful for their
presence.
While people fear illness and injury,
some fear doctors, and by extension,
the SJA, far more. Illogical I know, but
this is the fear I was relating to in my
letter.
Once again, Mr. Henry, I am sorry if
I have offended you (or anyone else)
with my letter. My intention has only
ever been to be lightly humorous. I
hope this response goes some ways to-
wards making amends.
P.S. Please don’t call me Mr. Davies.
It makes me sound like a Physics teach-
er, a misconception I would hate to
perpetuate.

Life Sciences must
change, not chop
Cut-price foods make me happy
I was impressed with the way
the Life Sciences cuts issue
was reported in Felix last term.
I am no journalist, I prefer to
beat them than join them, as a
rule, but I was impressed with
the way it confronted the issue
head on, as good journalism
should.
Various people have de-
scribed the cuts to Life Sci-
ences and damaging and un-
necessary. This I agree with.
When a Head of Department
is left with a hole the size of
the Lehmann Brothers in his
budget, it seems a bit rummy
for teaching staff to be com-
prehensively shat on in order
to make up the difference. I
am not going to say I feel sorry
for this HoD for the decision
he must make, these sorts of
things were part of what mid-
dle and senior management is
like.
So – we have a budgetary
cock-up and staff we do not
want to lose. What do we do?
There are various possible ac-
tions – cut the pay of all aca-
demic staff by perhaps £5k/
annum. This, for those who
do not watch ‘Yes, Prime min-
ister’ is also known as ‘Politi-
cian’s logic’. Something must
be done, this is something,
therefore we must do it. Sound
about right for the current
proposals?
I hope that the senior man-
agement in Life Sciences stud-
ied natural selection, so they
might be able to see where this
argument is going – perhaps
they should attend the lectures
given by the teaching staff they
want to axe, while they still
can. Academics, just like eve-
ryone else, need to move with
the times, need to evolve and
improve. This does not need
to be cutting away prime flesh.
Ironically I happen to know
that several of those whom
they want to axe are aware of
this need to modernise, and
have actively tried to bring this
about.
I don’t think I need to tell
you that I think this proposed
restructure is all wrong, but
now perhaps we have a con-
structive basis for a different
way of tackling the underlying
problems. These cuts are not
the only option.
