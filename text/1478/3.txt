DAILY FELIX
THE
Q&A Have you
gone mad?
N
o, not yet (but perhaps
we will have by the 4th
of March). Publishing
Felix every day, albeit only for
one week, is a challenge that
we’re very excited about.
We hope that each week we
produce a paper that you the
student find enjoyable and
informative. We sometimes
make mistakes and it may not
all be to your taste but we like
to think that you look generally
favourably on our efforts.
But we’re not about to sim-
ply rest on our laurels. We’re
always looking for new ways to
engage with the student body
and to push ourselves. The
Daily Felix will provide you the
student with up-to-date news,
interesting features and, at the
very least, fresh puzzles to do
every day.
It will be a ride into completely
unknown territory but ultimately,
that’s what makes life exciting.
How will it
work?
E
ach day will have its own
special supplement that
will mark it out from the
others. For example, Monday
will have an extended Sports
section with reporting from the
games on Wednesday and Sat-
urday. On Tuesday, we’ll have a
Music supplement, Wednesday
a Science supplement, Thurs-
day a Technology supplement
and Friday an Arts supplement,
with a guide to all the best
things to do that weekend.
Obviously we will be printing
fewer copies than usual so
make sure you don’t miss out.
We’ll have running threads
from issue to issue so try to
collect them all – puzzles fans
take note. But don’t worry if
you don’t, all of the content
will be online as usual.
The paper will be delivered
to the usual distribution areas
between 8 and 9 each morn-
ing and online concurrently.
28th February – 4th March
For the first time ever,
Felix will publish
every day
Can I help?
NOTICE
H
ell yeah! Sorry, I mean
of course. We’re look-
ing for students to help
out in all areas including re-
porting, writing, photographer,
editing and researching. If
you’ve ever considered helping
Felix out but haven’t done so
yet, this is the perfect oppor-
tunity. Email felix@imperial.
ac.uk or your preferred section
individually.
