Fortunately he had already scored 227.
Still managed to get out in silly ways
but generally looked good with the
bat. Might turn into England’s next all-
rounder after getting Michael Clarke out
in Adelaide.
Collingwood: 5/10
The ginger ninja fought until the end.
Now retired, but what a way to go!
Will be remembered in this series for
‘that catch’. Thanks Colly! Shame he
couldn’t bat this series.
Bell: 8/10
The Sherminator grew up to terrorise
the Aussies and was generally unlucky
to not get a proper bat in this series. Fi-
nally managed to get his first ever Ashes
century.
Prior: 8/10
Beard of the Year. Apparently. Record
number of catches and was brilliant be-
hind the stumps means he’ll be the test
keeper for at least a while. As long as the
beard stays.
Broad: 6/10
Malfoy sadly got injured early and had
to go home because of a side-strain. Still
managed to smash Clarke on the head
and steal into the TMS box.
Swann: 8/10
Two points here for the diary. Bowled
generally well on unhelpful surfaces.
World’s best spinner? Probably.
Anderson: 9/10
He was supposed to be rubbish in Aus-
tralia. He wasn’t. Leading wicket taker
in the series. ‘Nuff said.
Finn: 8/10
Hard to believe he’s younger than a lot
of people at this university. Still bowled
better than most of his elders in the Aus-
sie camp by a long way. Apart from

W
hile we were all
enjoying the big
freeze here in Lon-
don, some of the
enlightened few of
us Imperial College students might have
known that the Ashes were going on in
the convict colony known as Australia.
Too busy revising/partying and don’t
know what happened? Here’s a quick
recap and a player review.
England won 3-1, winning down un-
der for the first time in 24 years. Led by
some stellar performances, we decided
to review each player individually in-
stead of some spiel about who’s mummy
isn’t proud of them anymore (yes that’s
you Mitch).
England reviews
Strauss: 7/10
Led his team bravely unlike several oth-
er captains before him (cough Freddie
cough). Batted solidly to eventually av-
erage over 40, which is rare for English
captains on Aussie soil.
Cook: 10/10
766 runs at an average of 127 he cer-
tainly has shown his potential to be a
great of the modern game. Should we
still drop him after his abysmal summer
here last year? Yeah, I mean Bopara is a
better opener anyway.
Trott: 9/10
England’s latest import continued his
ruthless destruction of the Aussies mak-
ing us forget of the dark days when Bo-
para was no 3.
Pietersen: 8/10
England’s original import got out to the
dreaded left arm spin of Xavier Doherty.
Mitch.
Tremlett: 8/10
The gentle giant came to life and actu-
ally scared some of the Aussies and
walked away with 17 wickets after three
tests. Pretty good return to test cricket.
Tim Bresnan: 8.5/10
Half a point for being from Yorkshire.
Surprised many by actually not being
rubbish when brought into the side, es-
pecially the Australian batsman as he
ran through the top order in Melbourne.
Australian ratings
Mitchell Johnson: 10/10
Let’s face it. Nobody helped England
win the Ashes more than Mitch.
Xavier Doherty: 12/10
Okay wait maybe he did. He’ll never
play for Australia again though. Yes
that’s twelve out of ten!
Ricky Ponting: 2/10
Will go down in history as being the
only Aussie captain to lose the Ashes
three times in the modern era. Sadly
those two points were for sympathy and
not for his batting.
Mike Hussey: 9/10
Seriously though. This guy was the only
Aussie who stood up to be counted.
Supposedly had his career on the line,
he batted like a champion to end up the
second highest scorer in the series.
Steve Smith: 4/10
Who?
Barmy Army review: 10/10
If any of the reviews could be disputed,
this one can’t for sure. They provided
lyrical genius to contribute to Johnson’s
golden duck at the SCG.
