.Dear Sir,
Might I say how much I enjoyed the
letter written by the Misses Bradford?
It would he somewhat churlish to suggest
that they are, perhaps, somewhat biased
in their views, nevertheless, i n a l l
fairness, one must, I feel, put forward
the, what I' might c a l l , patrician point
of view.
Being an ancient and a philosopher, I
have noticed certain trends and currents
in the social atmosphere at I.C. Jn my
younger days, i t was a well known
aphorisa tfcat Tfemg ladies sheuld be
sew and net hssr*". f a r be i t from me
to suggest that this i s the formulation
of a fundamental and necessary law of
nature. But I feel i t mast be pointed
out that i n those happy days of yore,
many of the most talented sons of I.C.
were never to be seen i n the company
of Icwarians. It was considered a
social stigma i n that happy time to
treat any of these young ladies i n any
but the most polite way. I fear that
today this i s not so.
ToV^tum to the point of issue.
The most disturbing facet of the
recently rejuvenated rejectionism, i f
I may term i t so, i s the constantly
reiterated cry "
W
e don't want to go
into the bar! " Surely the Misses
Bradford cannot expect us to believe
their somewhat ingenuous explanation
that " I t was done for a 'dare' "? I t
is a well known fact that curiosity i s
the most prevalent f a i l i n g of our
entirely delightful Women's Associat-
ion. Unhappily, they seem to have
forgotten the old proverb about
curiosity and the cat. May I humbly
suggest that they do not, as the vul-
gar phrase has i t , ?!Poke €h$ir pretty
noses into what does not concern them?"

Oar govsrnmemt seems to make
a habit of appointing commissions anc
ignoring their orecomenda'tions. This
column w i l l not be used for the diso-
ussion of the Devlin or tho Monkton
Reports, but a few weld* on their •
treatment of the Anderson Committee's
report may not be out of 'place.
This committee was set up by
the government partly beoause of pres-
sure from RUS, to investigate the
structure of the system of awarding
student grants - not, i t should be
noted , the value of grants. It rec-
eived memoranda from numerous organ-
isations, covering every aspect of
this knotty problem and by February
1960, i t was reliably reported that
the recomendations were ready for
publication. Inspired leaks Indicated
that one major decision of the Comm-
itee would be that the means test
would be abolished a proposal whioh
was known to run counter to Govern-
ment polioy.
Since there seems l i t t l e point
in appointing high powered committee's
unless you intend to listen to their
conclusions, i t was optimistically
hoped that the means test would be
abolished i n time for this session.
However , for some 1jason or another
publication- was delayed u n t i l i t was
too late for any change to be made f o r
this session. Nevertheless, since
the oommittee were virtually unanimous
(the one dissident i s reported - by a
usually reliable source - to have
been absent from nearly a l l the work
of the oommittee), the Government
were expected to implement the reoom-
endations next session.
Instead the Government has
announced only a revision of tr- scales
Allowing for the rise i n mostpeoplea
incomes , this revision leaves us app-
roximately i n the same state as we were
i n a few years back.
Finally, I must say what pain the
f i n a l part of their letter gave me.
Surely the Misses Bradford cannot be
so naive as to think that any regular
attenaer i n the bar, would leave the
place where his needs could surely be
satisfied with a small brown, a Keg,
a Tankard, or even that most invig-
orating of a l l drinks, a Black-ana-Tan,
to taste of the f r u i t of the tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil? I refer
of course to what i s now, i n the
rather disgusting modern idiom,
referred to as, much as I hate to say
i t , "Third floor Coffee."
No, S i r ! I feel that I must add
my voice to those of that fine body
af men whose tankards are never
raised except to be emptied; whose
hands are never placed i n their back
pocket, except to buy the next round;
whose consolation i s beer.
Yours faithfully,
J. Carter'.

Dear Sir
The dlffiamlties of abtaiaiag a

-the showers.
One most either have a tepid shower
er be subjected te a lew-pressure steam -
blast, the mixing valves giving very
little adjustment between these sxta emeu.
. If, by aame flake, one baa
adjusted one ef the ahevewe te be just

completely spoils ernes originally

Ceald the skewers be made mere

spartan military camp, please? This,

mixing valves, bat weald be well worth

It cannot be argued that the
government has had new facts presented
to them, or that they have themselves
come out with new arguments against
the abolition of the means test.( It
i s rumoured that the Government's
announcement was brought forward bec-
ause of the projected HUS "Protest'
Weak " on grants. This timing i s int-
ended to itqp the campaign before i t
starts- by giving the impression that
a l l has beamcompletely deoided and
that more pressure w i l l have no effeot. .
These rumours, i f correct, indicate
that the Government i s f u l l y aware of
the shortcomings of i t s case). The only
"argument" so f a r presented has been
that to abolish the Means Test would
be technipally extremely d i f f i c u l t ! •

Mention of NHS reminds me, I
see from the printed accounts of the

would have been sufficient to a f f i l -

that the content of FEIJJCmight be wor-

— wetive i t was that

rCemmissien, i t was not because ef the
puny pressure exerted by suoh a paltry
organisation as N.U.S.
• According te Mr. Cox the Government
is in such terrvx- and trepidation at the
projected N.U.S. 'pretest' week'that
the Government has brought forward its
reply to scotch their activities. This
no doubt has avoided a week of student
uprising and pitched battle, culminating
in tho ever-throwing ef tyranny and the
establishment-of a Peoples (or Student's)
Daojeeraay.
Last session the Ualea finished
with a substantial ballsnco, whioh
has bean carried forward. This balance
was Mainly owing to the Athletics and
Social Clubs spending less than estimated.
Is view of the ever increasing number
ef Social (and new Reereatianal ) Clubs,
I de not think any such balance will
materialise this year. Also the Union
is now ocamittod to large expenditure,
with .tfee.aew Sports Centre. Oils will
probably' remove any illusion of flowing
oash and lucre. Even i f wo had the
spare aeaey, I da not think that i t is
worth spet, bag £300 to have the honour
of sending a delegate to vote, along
with delegates from such seats of learning
as Bast .Croydon Technical College, an
a'action of Solidarity with Puerto Rioana.
1 thank Mr. Cox far his greetings,
but moat express ay amasement at his
acknowledgement of what is a Christian
Festival. Perhaps 'Mr. Cox' is also
a pseudonym cloaking same publieity-
