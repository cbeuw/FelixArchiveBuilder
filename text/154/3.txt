Already tills term we have had
the first In the series of four Mock
Parliaments. At this, we had a Labour
Government with a Liberal Opposition,
the Conservatives and Communists being
uncommitted back-benchers. The debate
was divided into two seotionsi Question
Time, which was mainly an attack on the
Parliamentary Labour Party's two-way
position on defence, and the presen-
tation of a B i l l on Education. The lat-
ter led to some lively exchanges on
Comprehensive and Public Schools.
Early next term, probably at 7.0.
p.m. on January 10th., the next iibck
Parliament will be held, with a Lib-
eral Government and Communist Oppo-
sition. The main topic under discus-
sion will be Home Rule. Everyone who
thinks - or doesn't think - on this
subject is welcome to attend and add
to the discussion, irrespective of
their political or non-political opin-
ions, or whether they come from Pair
Isle, Birmingham, or the Falkland Isles.

On Wednesday 23rd November,
6 members of the Society t r a v e l *
led out to Amersham, f o r a t r i p
in the brake-van of the afternoon
l o c a l goods t r a i n on the
Metropolitan l i n e to Harrow.
The inspector at Amersham
received us, having been
summoned from h i s o f f i c e by an,
"Oi", from the gum-chewing and
overweight t i c k e t c o l l e c t o r . He
t o l d us that the t r a i n would not
leave f o r some time as he thought
there was no guard. Someone then
quoted the departure time given
in the working timetable. "Ah",
said the inspector, "but you
can't, go by that, can you?"
Our guard eventually
alighted from a goods t r a i n ,
passing i n the other direction,
and we started o f f . We could
A B R A K E
have ridden inside the van, but
being railway maniacs, we rode
on the front balcony, which
enabled us to take photos and
see more, although we nearly
froze.
We spent about half an
hour at Chalfont & Latimer,
shunting into a siding, while
various main l i n e trains went
by. A f t e r a few signal stops,
we steamed majestically
through Rickmansworth without
stopping, and from Moor Park
to Harrow, we had a wonderful
view of the works i n progress
in widening the l i n e from 2 to
4 tracks. F i n a l l y our freight
tra"in made a special stop i n
the middle of Harrow station
and we dismounted to the
interested stares of hordes
of schoolgirls on the opposite
platform.
MORPHYMANIA SEQUEL
The Baiter,
Felix.
Dear Sir,
X am sere that « y feir person en
the tenpath at Putney en Morphy Day will
agree mat Mei'eajaaala was a good t i t l
far the burbling* of the President ftt
R.C.S. an the afternoon's events. I give
him great credit far the vast extent of
his imagination wale* mast, be second
only to that of Edward Lear.
I agree with his estimates er the
respective nnabers. I believe versanally
t h a t the perennial failure ef R.C.S. te
turn eat adequate support for their areas
sad Basest is a clever plot te aaderaias
the morale ef stoat Guildasaa who prefer
te fight i f anything against the adds.
It is for this reason that twe
special squads were detailed set te
fight but te guard the aawaitlen damp
at the rear and te guard the spanner.
Having left me with the THERMOMETER, tan
President ef R.C.S. halved his efforts
and responsibilities and doubled mine.
This outburst of partisanship Is
designed elaarly te overshadow the eraam-
iag vietery ef the twe Guilds' eights
in the Merphy and Larry raoes.. The
total effect ef the afternoon an R.C.S.
was mirrored i s the faces ef these who
rede away from Putney ea Jesabel* The*
seemed te reflect the gloom ef t»<"
evening sdst ever the river.
Above a l l , I take exeeptien te tea
printing of one-aided lepeate ef this
nature i s Felix without the eaamoe ef
reply by the other aide in the same
issue. lea should, Sir, take mere
ears te avoid the eharge ef being
prejudiced.
I weaU like to take this
opportunity ef thanking Messrs. Gay
and Bareford for suggesting that
"Gtoildsmsa would be able te find
eeagenial hostel aoseaedatien i s the
intkrapeld section (of the Natural
History Museum)." Since we live at
present in sues surroundings wader the
three callage arrangement, the term
'congenial' is well chases.
Speaking as one who lives in the
same Hall as Mra Guy, I weald not,fled
the ehaage ef atmosphere sad eempsay at
all abrupt,
loura sincerely,
K.B« Greaves,
Pres. C.&C. Snin.
Dear Sir,
Does the aenearable Felix, self-
styled "newspaper ef the Imperial
College", asw equate himself with one
ef the lesser oelleges, aad eeaspire
la perpetrating false ramears eenoera-
ing the deeds ef the esteemed City
aad Gauss college? This is eertaisly
the impression one receives frea the
front page ef Issae Ne.153. In fair-
ness I will aay that Felix was oerreot
in aiving proeedaaee ef ooaaoat te a
Bomber e f the side which lest both
battle aad raoes am Meraay Day,, bet
surely he has the cosmos deoenoy te
ensure that i t i s fair oeane at? J It
weald be tedious te list the atreoioos
roneris made i s the ax-Hale; snffioe te
say that i f the •assets were , in fast,
sot involved in the battle aa waa
stated, then R.C.S. was gailty ef meet
unfair play, since they were dearly
seen attempting te deprive the Guilds'
President ef their tensest.
It only remains for me te say that
i f Felix dees set shew a smart
iqareveawat in his manners, he will
k m lost at least one reader,
lasers faithfelly.

Dear Sir,
The viae President of the City
and Gailds Union decides to stay l a bed
one Sunday: the editor of Felix i s ac-
cused ef being predjudioed. These twe
statements may seem totally uneemeeted
yet there is a most significant connect-
ion. Let me explain; the vine-Presid-
ent of C&G. stays in bed' , falls to
write a.report ea Merphey Day for f
e l i x
aad the Baiter is aeeesed ef wafsir
It seems strange that the President
ef C.&G. should have to wait until the
fi.CS. Union reports en Marphy Day before
being being able te offer oesment, er
perhaps the President of C.AG. was net
aware that Felix had asked his Union fo
a report on Morphy Day.
Did Mr. Stock fall asleep en Merphy
Bay? The result of'the cattle , sir ,
was a draw ; perhaps you are not aware
that both Presidents were thrown in the
Thames, this was intended te signif*
a drawn battle.
Why did the President ef C.&G.
burden himself with the Mascots in the
battle ? It was agreed that they shs/old
set be involved; why invent (post V Attle?)
battle plans to protect them? Why create
extra responsibilities? Why-not .just
leave the Mascots en the side of the '
tewpath where .they were deposited after
the custard-pie. fracasff Does the answer
lie l a the C.4G. Union? Were they
capable ef adhering to the agreed rules
of combat, oapable of leaving the Maseota
untouched? Obviously their President
thought net.
The Swimming Gala at the U.L.U.
bath en Deo. 9th. is the next. inter -
oollege tournament; i t seems a logical
continuation ef Marphy Day, yet there
is little opportunity for war. Unless
we consider the Presidents race-
excuse me, I must go te see my Trophy
Officer- my water wings may be in danger.
Tears faithfully,
Alan Logan.
PSB3IDEHT OF O H SUMS IT UP
Dear Sir,
As as impartial observer ef tie
aerphy Day fracas any I endorse
Mr. Logans suggestion that a l l those
with doubts eenoeraiag the beat rase
should come te the gala ea Dee. 9th
sad ameer their respective Presidents
to vietery.
Surely this will prove who was
on Marphy Day in the eld established
trial-4r/-*ater method
