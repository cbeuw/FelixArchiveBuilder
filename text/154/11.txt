The Basketball team has got off to
a poor start this season, having won only
four of the eight Batches played. There
are probably two reasons for this, lack
of adequate practise at the beginning af
the term caused by the polio oase, and
the need to build a fresh team. Only
four of last year's team have survived
to remain at College, which has meant
that we have had ta rely almost entirely
on this, year's freshers.
The team has entered for two leagues
this year, the University League, and
<tt» - LttBdcn Laea^ mviaien I, fhWgjfeaaea
promoted after last year's rucoessTul
season. The team has won all its Batches
in the U.L.U. league beating H.C.L.5J-24,
U.O.L. 45-24. and Batter.ea 45-40.
The.game against Battersea was a needle
match as they were the only team to gain
victory against us in the U.L.U. league
last year. It was an exciting match,
won only after exra time. However i t
developed into a rugger match, the re-
feree having ao control over the game.
In the London League we have been far
from successful, beating only one olub,
Croydon, by a narrow margin.
lor the first tine this year we
decided to enter the Rational Championships
In the first round we were drawn against
London University and Chelsea In a three
eexnexed play off. Both teams got the
better of us. We were Beaten by Chelsea
after a bard match b y 38-44 having been
level with three minutes to go. London
University gave us a good lesson on how
to play basketball. They are an a l l
Aaeriesa team, probably the best in the
Country and we did well to hold them to
JI-90.
Outstanding individual players have
bean Dennis Wiokenden as Captain in de-
-fenoe together w i t h Eon Parke* and
TJiathews In attaok. As the season pr-
piogreases we should improve and we look
forward to sore suooess, hoping to reach
the high playing standard of last year's
