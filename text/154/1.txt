INTRODUCTION^
- H a v e you ever stopped to think how
much' effort i s involved i n producing
the newspaper that you are reading now?
It * s very doubtful. ''Most new recruits
to the staff are absolutely amazed at
the amount of work which i s necessary.
In order to give you a better idea we
now take you behind the scenes and for
the f i r s t time i n Felix history we
show you "how i t ' s done."
RAW MATERIAL. .
To start with we need raw material.
Felix only has a few writers on i t s
staff, we depend on you to produce
•Ost of the copy. Some people need very
l i t t l e prompting to pick up their pens
and pencils. However-the vast
majority have to be cajoled, or even
threatened. This i s a pity beoause
'this newspaper should refleot the
Spirit which makes the Union what i t
i s .
SUNDAY WORKING
Once the copy i s i n the hands of
the F e l i x staff i t i s read through
and any errors, grammatical or other-
wise, are corrected. Much of this i s
done as soon as the material i s
received. However we really get down
to business on the Sunday before the
Friday of issue. We begin to gather
i n the Press Room (opposite t h e v l i f t
on the third, floor of the Uniua) a t
a time i n the morning whioh seems to
be almost completely unheard of i n
student circles, sometimes as early
as 7.30 a.m.
"PREPARATION OF THE COPT
One of the f i r s t tasks i s to type
out a l l the copy into columns just
aver thxae inches »i<is.This l a
usually enough to keep three o r four
^.typewriters busy for seven or eight
fcoura*:« These columns are then
Inspected f o r mistakes. These are
corrected by typing out the oca*-
plete line i n which the mistake occurs,
carefully cutting out this single l i n e
of type and pasting i t over the
original line. Once the oolums are
olear of mistakes they are arranged oh
large white boards, each one of which
represents one side of one page of the
paper. At the same time the t i t l e s
and headings of the articles, etc. are
being stencilled. An average eight
page -issue carries well over five
hundred letters produced by this
method. This keeps one person busy
from about 6 p.m. almost u n t i l work
i s finished which may be as late as
1 a.m. on Monday.
When a l l material f o r one page
i s ready and the layout has been
determined then the job of"sticking
down' begins. With the help of
guide l i n e s drawn with a blue pencil
on the boards a l l the typewritten
copy, the headings, and any photo-
graphs are pasted on accurately
with a substance known as "cow gum."
This i s a type of rubber Solution
which.allows the copy to be removed
easily from the boards so that they
.can be used again. F i n a l l y the
straight black lines are put onto the
boards to separate the different
Articles and* the boards are ready to be
taken t o the printer,.
PBDTOGRAIHING THE BOARDS
At the printers'premises each
board i s marked accurately with
centering lines, one horizontal,one
vertical, and then set up before a
camera eleven feet long. High
contrast orthochrcmatice f i l m i s used
so that our blue guide lines do not
appear on the finished newspaper. Then
a l l the photographs i n the paper are
removed from the boards and photographed
separately on half-tone f i l m so that i n
the finished newspaper they' render a
correct tone contrast.
MAKING THE PLATES-
Once the films have oeen developed
and dried the half-tone or "screen"
f i l m i s cut up and the pieces are
inserted into windows cut into the
high-contrast or "line" film,thus mak-
ing a negative equal i n size to the page
which you are reading now. .Should our
work at I.C. not be up to standard, and
this i s very often the case, then these
