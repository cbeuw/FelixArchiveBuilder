The oorreapondenoe concerning the
admittance of the f a i r gender to the
bar seems to be reaching unmanagable
proportions.
The opinions expressed by the
Misses Bradford are widely held, not
only among members of I.C.W.A. but also
among visitors. Very few women want to
invade this masculine stronghold. Judy
Cox draws attention to the inconvenience
caused to would be hostesses, while
Mr, P
.
W
. Jolly puts forward some
constructive suggestions whioh warrant
much closer inspection,
What would be the advantages of a
mixed bar? As Mr. J o l l y points out
somewhere i s needed for those of us who
would like to entertain our lady friends.
He also says that at the week-end " i t
could help to alleviate some of the
crush that spoils the main bar," I t
would also be of advantage to those
people who find themselves i n the same
predicament as Mrs. Cox. In addition
i t could provide a forum for those who
Just simply like to meet people for
the exchange of ideas and opinions,
On the debit side i s that
omnipresent ogre - money. Any
structural alterations are going to
cost money. Would the benefits
balance the expense? I think they
would.
I agree with Mr. J. Carter
that the use of the present bar
should be restricted to the male
members of the oommunity. A haven
where those who wish to oan prove
their capacity for alcohol, where
they can sing their bawdy songs,
where they can demonstrate fcheir
"masculinity" without causing
embarrassment, annoyance and
discomfort to others.

Dear S i r ,
In the years that we have
been a t t h i s college, we have
been at one time o r another,
annoyed by i t , fed up with i t ,
and completely at a loss as to
what t o make o f i t . But never,
u n t i l Friday night, have we been
actually disgusted by i t ( o r
more correctly by some of our
fellow-students here).
During the cabaret at Guilds
Carnival we heard a sura t o t a l
of a dozen complete phrases from
the stage, and we were s i t t i n g
one-and -a half, and three yards
from i t . What we did hear was
a continuous barracking that
could never, by any stretch of
the imagination, be taken as
i n t e l l i g e n t audience p a r t i c i p -
ation. I t seemed to us t o he a
deliberate attempt to ruin the
cabaret and, as far as we are
concerned, i t worked perfectly.
Now s i t t i n g on a hard,
crowded f l o o r for over half an
hour can be d i f f i c u l t . . Some
people might subscribe t o the
view that i f a cabaret turns out
to be... well l e t ' s say "weak"
this gives them the right t o
barrack. Personally we would
be in favour of s i t t i n g i t out
in silence, i f only out of
appreciation of the six weeks
hard work put i n by the producer,
cast, band, etc.. However, on
Friday we had no chance t o judge
whether the performance was i n
fact, good o r bad. The bad
behaviour certainly wasn't a
vote of censure because i t start-
ed the moment the f i r s t man came
onto the stage and from then on
i t was sheer h e l l . We heard not
one of the witty phrases "from
the f l o o r " that used to be a
regular feature of Carnival
cabarets.
Presumably some 1+0% of
those at the carnival were from
outside the college, almost
certainly there w i l l have been
a few for whom t h i s was the
f i r s t real association with the
so-called "top 3%" who go t o
the university. Three of our
friends had never been here
before, they went away convinc-
ed that some of us were nothing
but loud-mouthed louts. So did
we.

Dear S i r ,
On the subject of allowing women
i n the bar there have been various
calls on the me.x of the college to
oxslhda the fair sex, thus assuming
that a war exists between the sexes
over this issue. In fact we are"-;*:,%
quite sure that the vast majority of
us have not the slightest wish to
invade" the "male Hbly-of-Holies."
The incident which" brought about this
latest spate of "Keep them out" was
entered upon as a dare to enliven a
Freshers Dinner which was proceeding
very tamely. This fact was shown by
the number of Pictures of the "Holy-
of-Holies" who had deserted the bar
for lass potent (?) l i q u i d refresh-
ment on the third floor.
Soberly yours,
Beverly Bradford

Dear S i r ,
Have yourtwo correspondents, on
the subject of women i n the Bar in
the last issue of Felix, realised
that at times i t can be quite
inconvenient that woman cannot enter?
We cannot take our friends into the
bar or join them there, or even go
inside to buy them a drink: instead
we have to ask someone to buy for us.
At present, though, . iti.aaves my pocket,
sinoe I don't pay f o r drinks under
these circumstances.

Dear S i r ,
btt us once and for a l l time
. f i n i s h the annual bickering that'
arise* over the -bar.
let us be rational and faced
with the. increasing numbers of
aquariums allowed into I.C. each
Year,; l e t us build a cocktail bar.
A mixed bar where those of us who
enjoy taking their friends for a
drink may >go."
That no such place exists could
be quickly remedied leaving
generations to come indebted to
those who held office this year.
At f i r s t i t need only be
opened during the evenings of the
weekend when i t could help to
alleviate some of the crush that
spoil3 the main bar. 'whatever
arrangements are decided on, <^-C.
needs a mixed bar.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear S i r ,
Since correspondence on the
drinking habits of young ladies
about College seems to be i n fashion
may I beg space i n your columns to
bring to your attention a most
disturbing occurence.
I recently had occasion to
attend a Sherry Party organised By
that most austere of bodies, namely
the Imperial College Women's
Association. To my utmost horror I
found on my arrival that the only
beverage .available was
sherry. How oan the correspondent
"Well wisher" i n the last issue
possibly claim that such "I.C.W.
Arians" are "pure and innocent"
when suoh corruption i s r i f e among
them. To my great discomfort I was
forced by etiquette to consume two
whole glasses of this obnoxious
f l u i d as a result of whioh I relapsed
into a highly inebriated state. I f
such i s the code of behaviour, S i r ,
then I oan only c a l l upon the men of
Imperial College to remain united
against the impending female onslaught
Yours i n good f a i t h .
