GOLF
Golf, hockey, and croquet,
have undisputed s i m i l a r i t i e s .
A l l adopt d i f f e r i n g methods of
propelling a round object
around the globe, but b a s i c a l l y
the desire t o direct the b a l l
into an opening , whether i t be
goal, hole or stirrup, i s the
same.
Similar too are the
regulations as t o swing. In
hockey, i t i s required that one
does not raise the atick above
ones shoulder l e s t one should
f e l l a fellow player. Golf
asserts that i f the swing should
become too large, the body w i l l
enter a state of highly c r i t i c a l
equilibrium, and I am informed
by a croquet authority, that
these are inherrant personal
problems i f the mallet be raised
too f a r .
It seems unlikely that many
people are well versed i n a l l
these games,, but d i s t i n c t traces
of each were noticeable on
Wednesday l a s t when a return
battle was fought with U.C.,
amid the muds o f Highgate. I am
led t o understand that many of
those present were overcome by a
desire t o "keep the b a l l low"
into the wind and while the
majority considered hockey a good
approximation under the p r e v a i l i n g
conditions. I gather that our
vice-captain was observed t o be
assaulting the b a l l i n a
croquet l i k e manner on the
putting green. However, i t must
be stated here, that he and four
others of our side, came home
smiling as a result o f a 5:1
defeat of our oponents, which to
say the least was favourable. (
We have our f i n a l match of
the team versus L.S.E. at
Sundridge Park next Wednesday,
and should i t occur that we beat
these monetary fellows the
record of played 5; l o s t 1,
drawn 1, won 3, w i l l doubtless

sucessful trips,both from the point of
view of social and economic aspects,and
especially i n the case of the Sheffield
trip,where we were able to stay to a hop
a very enjoyable time was had by a l l . A t
Sheffield, we were unfortunate enough, to)
f i n d both Manchester and Sheffelld a t
f u l l strength and we were well and truly
swamped,our f i r s t man being led Wilkins
in 13th.position. At Oxford we were more
auoessful,beating B e l l i o l and a Univer-
s i t y College-St.John's combined team,only

strength and took the d i v i s i o n 1 mateh

Barriers, the team was seriously depleted
due t* University commitments and injuries
I t i# a pity that we l a v a to- turn up to '
these h'igh class matches w i t h what i s
v i r t u a l l y a strengthened second team, as
i t disappoints the opposition and throws
an unfair burden on the lower members of
the team. I.C.had three men wall up, (J.
Bernard,5th.,T.Larkum,6th.,and P.Warren,
