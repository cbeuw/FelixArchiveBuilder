Dear Sir,
As a continuation of the a l -
ready extensive correspondence on the
subject of choosing the President of
the Union, I would like to make a few
points on behalf of the supposed mor-
onic majority who are treated as being
incapable of making any intelligent
contribution to Union affairs.
The situation at present saws
to be that we are considered unfit to
vote for a President ourselves on the
grounds that we know insufficient of
the potentialities of the candidates.
Yet we are permitted -the ge«t honour
ef electing at Union Meetings a body ef
{supermen known as the union Council''
who aie deemed f i t to speak for us .
all in choosing the.President. But i t
must be patently obvious that less is
known about the numerous candidate* _
for the counoil poets by those who
choose them as their mouthpiece, than
would be known about the much smaller
number of candidates for the single
post of President, i Furthermore.these
members of the council' who are elected
at Union meetings can only speak for
the few hundred or so who are present
at such meetings .
I suggest that the apparent rel-
uctance at the top to open the flood
gates of democracy is a reactionary
trait among the social cliques oppo-
sed to any reduction of their infla-
enoe in the college .
I submit that the only positive
approach to the question is to bold
a referendum to see what proportion
of us - the students of I.e.- axe
prepared to be responsible for elect-
ing our President democratically.
At present we hear only trn
chorus ef the extrovert indnority -
the important factor is surely the
opinion that lies i n the deep s t i l l
waters of the majority.
Assuming that tha majority vote
to i>a in favour of a democratically
elected president let the Oounoll
f u l f i l a useful: function by org-
anising'publicity and hustings in
suoh a way that every member of the
Union will have ample opportunity
(and interest) to form an opinion a.
about the candidates.
A democratically eleete**p*esl-
dent would help to break down the amah
deplored barrier between .the brown
baggers and those active in the soil-
age life. In any ease the present
feudal, system is an Insult to intel-
ligent human beings.

Dear Sir,
Tour Editorial opinion that
there is a case for "radical changes"
in I.C. teaching methods expresses
what very many students have been
thinking for years• namely, that the
present system of lectures, tutorials,
and private study is appallingly waste-
ful. It is only when a lecture oourse
is outstandingly good that one's orig-
inal notes are better, for revision
purposes, than a textbook.
In the Services, the aim of a
training course i s to teach a maximum
of information in a minimum of time.
This may well be a false ideal of Uni-
versity education, but a l l the same
the military process is remarkably
efficient. One of its main features i s
the show ing of films, which give a
general picture of the subject in a
vivid pictorial manner, leaving i t to
the lecturer to f i l l In the mathemati-
cal details. It is a sign of long-awai-
ted progress that an enterprising lec-
turer in the Physios Department i s
supplementing hie Eleotronics oourse
with a Bevies of films from tft.illard's.
This technique could nave far wider, ap-
plication.
However, the backbone of every
coarse will remain the lectures, and
the general standard of these is low.
It may be true that good lecturers are
born rather than made) but there is one
pieoe of advice that any lecturer oould
followi cultivate a good Board Tech-
nique.
Host students find i t impossible
to listen to what the lecturer says
end at the same time write down what
he has just written. Thus i t is up to
the lecturer to provide, on the black-
board, enough information - oamplet*
with headings - to build a coherent
skeleton of the topioj"ao that oven i f
the student cannot hear a v oxd, ha will
be able to slog through his notes at
soma latex date and make sense of than.
What the lecturer actually says weald
be the flesh to olotho «at* skeleton.
XT fite student oan digest seas of this
as veil, so snob, the better.
This advice may seem obvious, bet
X am amazed at the number of leetexexe
that never seem to have realised i t ,
especially status they mast have enee
been students themselves and been exes*
parated by leUtoWoali who write eaeetlona
in odd corners of the beard, or wLo rub

The t r i p started at 7 p.m.
on Friday 18th November with the
departure by coach from the
Union of 34 members of the I.C.
& Bedford Youth Hostel Groups.
The Journey to Buttermere was
uneventful, although most theor-
i e s on how to get beneficial
sleep were disproved. Neverthe-
l e s s a 200 yard. walK along a
frosty road to the Youth Hostel
served to awaken most of us. By
breakfast time the sun had come
out, and thus the various parties
set out i n high s p i r i t s .to such
places as Great Gable, High S t i l e
and P i l l a r .
There was snow on many of
the tops, and with the Autumn
t i n t s of the lower slopes the
views were quite beautiful. One
unforgetful sight was the panor-
ama from the top of Great Gable,
which included Helvellyn snow
capped, and with cloud just
touching the top. Such were the
murals of our rocky dining room
as we ate our lunches of. corned
beef, date cake, Ryvita, etc..
The snow was useful as a t h i r s t
quencher and also enabled us to
have a snow-ball f i g h t to use up
"Surplus energy". The descent
by way of Scarf Gap was complet-
ed just a 8 dusk was f a l l i n g .
After supper most people adjourn-
ed to "The Fish" and having
suitably refreshed themselves,
returned to the hostel t i r e d out,
but unwilling te admit i t .
To the surprise of everyone
the next day was also dry.
However, our departure from the
hostel was s l i g h t l y delayed by
the disappearance of three pairs
of boots. When they were
found i t was stated that they
had been hidden because of
alle/ged "shining" by t h e i r
owners. Owing to a mistake the
only crime of the young lady
who owned one p a i r was to have
small feet.
The Sunday was spent i n
similar fashion to the previous
day, although the walks tended —
to be les3 strenous, and
contained such things as a
demonstration by a graduate
engineer on how to dam a
mountain stream. As tea had
been arranged at "The Fish",
most people were down s u f f i c i -
ently early to come and partake,
before the coach l e f t at 5
o'clock.
The effect of meal and pub
stops i n quick succession was
to put most people i n a j e l l y
mood. Hence there followed a
hectic hour or so, during
which shoe stealing and f r i e n l -
l y f i g h t s were r i f e . At about
11 o'clock everyone settled
down peaceably. The coach
arrived back at I.C. at 4:30 on
Monday morning, and i t i s
perhaps fortunate that there
was aa one about to see the odd
looking types who got out of i t .
