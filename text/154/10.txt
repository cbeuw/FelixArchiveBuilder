EDUCATION
Last Thursday tho Huxley Society
held a discussion on education. The
talk was led by Finlay D. MaFhereen.
He first of a l l gave a short talk:-
"Upon the education of the people
of this country the fate of this country
depends? Disraeli's statement made in
1&74 s t i l l rings as true today as i t did
then. Since this field is so inport-
-ast, so correspondingly i t is wide.
For the purposes of this discussion we
will consider the eduoation of the rul-
-ors of society.
The purpose of education is the
developing of a latent character image
or, as Herbert Spencer said, "Education
has as its object the formation ef char-
-actor." In addition to this, eduoation
is a process ef fitting a citizen to take
up a role in society. The trouble with
education at present in this country i s
that the Government have forgotten the
first aim, and concentrated on "fitting
out" technologists and ether roles in
society.
The entire sohool system at present
with its specialist lines i s aimed at
providing the country with the. quota ef
scientists etc. i t needs. This polioy
was in effect stated by Sir David Socles
when he oaae te I.C. a fortnight ago.
In order to visualise the difference
betwwen the two types of education, let
us take an analogy. Suppose there is
a large park, completely walled in: new
imagine a child i s placed inside and
told that there is a gate at the ether
aide i f he wants to get out. There
are two possible ways of equipping the
child. Firstly, you oan give him a map
ef the way te the gate, tell him how ta
read the map and tell him he must get
to the gate where a prize awaits. This
corresponds to the English system where
the examination and university entrance
i s the ultimate prize. Secondly, you
can place the child in the field and
say merely, there is a gate at the other
end ef the park. By this method the
child is fcreed te develop*; and think
no matter what he does; i f he stays put
he has at least sade the decision to
stay put, i t has not been sade for his.
This is what is wanted is the sehoels
Net as suoh specialisation and exam,
hunting; not segregation by examination
but spontaneous grading as in the comp-
rehensive school; sore emphasis on pri-
nciples, oonoepts and matters ef inter-
est , *h'»lriwg rather than faot learning
There is no reason for specialisat-
ion at school ; i t oould easily be abo-
lished by making university degree
0oursas longer
Is oonoluslon, i f we do not want
our future administrators to be narrow
slsflos specialists worn cut at the age
ef 35 by the pace of the- competition ,
then the Government should start think-
ing of the real meaning of education ;
"that whioh fits the citizen to perform
skillfully and magnanimously a l l the
affairs both private and publio in both
peaoe and war".
In the subsequent dissuasion the
question of National Service and the
unfortunate effects it's abolition is
having wag discussed and the mixing of
classes and discipline were cited.
The teacher rjhild relationship
was deplored as was the attitude af
parents to the education of their
children, "My Johnny's leaving i
sohool when he's 15 ; I's net having
him going i n for a l l this studying
nonsense ".
Finally the meeting
agreed that purely scientific
colleges were a bad idea and
that the educational policy today
was a shortsighted and a dangerous
policy.
The meeting was then declared
closed.

GUILDS CARNIVAL
On Friday December 2nd,
Guilds held t h e i r annual
carnival with the usual success.
This year's theme- Shakespearean
cum Elizabethan, o f f i c i a l l y
e n t i t l e d "MEASURE FOR PLEASURE"
or "OVENOFF WITH JULIET"
provided good material f o r both
the f l o a t s and the cabaret.
The transformation of the
Concert Hall, which i s the
greatest problem f o r the organiz-
ation of any function, into the
main street of a sixteenth
century v i l l a g e was most authen-
t i c . The effect of depth was
achieved by built-out structures
of large proportions. One was
an olde inne-"Ie Come & Grip",
notable f o r i t s masterpieces i n
o i l . A backcloth to the stage,
constructions over each door and
a v i l l a g e pump completed the
atmosphere. The lax morals of
Shakespeare's England were
depicted f u l l y on the f l a t s .
The cabaret was a ne».
teparture f o r Carnivals, and one
ihat deserves f a r more investig-
ation. At the carnival t h i s
revue style of cabaret was put
under considerable d i f f i c u l t y -
one of the microphones being
rendered inoperative. The
whole show had to be performed
at shouting p i t c h i n opposition
to several unwelcome and
unamuslng "gentlemen" who found
entertainment i n trying to ruin
the enjoyment of the audience,
The continuity of the show
was excellent throughout. The
wily c r i t i c i s m that has been
l e v e l l e d at the form of the acts
i s that they r e l i e d too much on
the spoken word f o r t h e i r i n t e r -
est and that an element of farce
would have added to the enjoyment.
The s p i r i t of a carnival cabaret
should allow, I think, f o r a
considerable amount of audience
p a r t i c i p a t i o n to keep up the
f e s t i v e atmosphere.
I would l i k e to express my
congratulations to those who
helped produce a carnival of such
high standard.
