negatives have to be retouched before
the "offsett1 1
printing plates can be
prepared. ?hese are flexible sheets of
aluoinitm which Lave a pre* sensitised
surface over which the negatives are
placed and then exposed f o r seven
minutes to a carbon axe leap. Been of
these offsett plates carries two pages
of Felix, making four plates i n a l l for
an eight page copy. Thus one plate
carries pages one and eight, another
oarries pages two and 3even, and so on.

Although the offsett plates have
perfectly smooth surfaces those parts
whioh have been exposed to the arc lamp
through the negative have a different
reaction towards, the printing ink than
do those parts whioh have not. The
plates, once mounted on the drum of the
printing machine, are then set to work
and Felix begins to r o l l off the press.
Each sheet of paper whioh mades up this
magazine passes twice through the press,
once for eaoh side. In a l l i t takes
only three hours f o r Felix to go through
the actual printing process.
PUTTING THE PAGES TOGETHER
Having been printed the eight page
Felix i s s t i l l i n two separate pieces.
The oopy whioh you are reading now has
been put together and folded by hand.
So. have a l l the other one thousand, four
hundred and ninety-nine. This i s easily
the most monotonous part of the printer's
job. It takes three people over three
hours.
