The Smoking Concert i s unique
i n I.C. to R.C.S. and i t has been
going strong since the days of
B.G.Wells. I t s purpose i s to enable
the audience to smoke, drink and be
entertained. There were 550 pints
to drink and a show to entertain but
nothing to smoke. But what else
oan you'expeot f o r 2/6d?
The ale may not have been the
best,but the show was. The presen-
tation was sliok and the number of
poor acts was at a minimum. I t was
good to see so many varied acts, some
of whioh would not have disgraced the
West End stage. The acts suited
every taste and ranged from slap-
stick to some pretty acid ccount
about the new physios building. The
audience responded very well and
enjoyed every minute of i t . Unfor-
tunately an irresponsible few rushed
the stage,'but like everything else
about the show they were quickly dealt
with before they caused damage.
It i s impossible to pick out the
best aot, as so many were equally good
In their own way, but Anne P h i l l i p s ,
C l i f f Adams and Robin Hiddihough, were
tho outstanding individual performers,
Stan Salmon and Mike Smith provided the
auaio and were as excellent as ever.
The gap caused by the passing of Malcolm
Green to older places was well f i l l e d
by John MoManus who proved himself to
be the oampere with the most hair.
But the man of the moment was undoubt-
edly the producer, Norman Franklin,who
encouraged and helped a l l the acts and
put them together to make a Concert
worthy-of the fi.C.S.

How many freshers have heard of the
Thorpe-Whiteley ? Ruth Oldham has not
only heard of i t but has worked there i n
her f i r s t month at I.C. ! She finished
the Organic Practical course i n half the
a l i o tod time'. There was. nothing more
for her to do i n the Hoffmann so she was
transferred to the Thorpe-Whiteley lab.
We understand that she wis assisting
Dr.A.C.Cross i n his research into the
constitution of scymnol.
Brilliance i n Practical Organic
Chemistry i s not Ruth's only,claim to
fame. She i s one of Britain's leading
long, distance swimmers. She became the
f i r s t woman to swim Ullswater only four
months after she had taken up the sport.
She has also swum Windermere and More-
-oombe Bay (three times each) and Con-
-iston Water once. Her next objective
i s that l i t t l e gap between us ani the
rest of Europe. She i s a member of
I.C. swimming team and i s the only female
member of the College to represent the
University for a3 long as we can remember.
Another of her interests i s horse-
raoing. She hunts and points-to-
points with the Vale of Lone Harriers,
and has paraded horses at nearly every
National Hunt meeting i n the North and
Midlands, including the Grand National.

°lhe S.C.C. met on the 21st.' Nov.
for the second time this term .
Mr. Quereshi was elected to the S.C.C.
Executive - a place being vacant due to
the unfortunate departure of Mr. Chandmal
last term.
The Chairman reported that Council
had agreed to the debating society being
placed i n the S.C.C.
Mr. H i l l reported that the matter
of the expansion of the Internal Mailing
System , so that i t could be used by a l l
members of the College had been passed
t o the Domestic Bursar but no further
deotaions had been made.
For some time now several oluba
have been running a bookstall on the f i r s t
floor of the Union, on Thursday and Friday
lunchtimes , There was considerable'disc-
ussion on how this could be brought more
into the publio eye and henoe made more
suoesaful . I t was decided s-
1) To approach the Domestic Bursar
with a view to opening a bookstall i n
part of the Lounge i n Ayrton Hall.
2) To ask the union Council i f the
bookstall oould also be held on Monday
and Tuesday lunchtimes
3) The S.C.C. executive was directed
to investigate the possibilityaf moving
It to another position i n the Union.
Since the meeting«the Domestic
Bursar has agreed to the use of part of
the Ayrton Hall Lounge f o r this purpose.
There was further discussion of our
responsibility towards Overseas students
in College . To satisfy their expressed
desire to meet B r i t i s h Students.inform-
a l l y , so that genuine friendships oould
be formed and understanding created , an
earlier meeting had deoided to i n i t i a t e
a number of informal "Contact Groups".
This meeting discussed how the people
to start suoh groups should be chosen ,
and what o f f i c i a l control i f any, there
should be once the soheme was underway.
After a long discussion the Chairman
summed up i n the following wordst
"There are two basio tendencies -
one to make the scheme o f f i c i a l with
reports e t c , and the other that
there i s no formal or o f f i c i a l inter-
ference at a l l . We have to decide, between
the two ; we must start off with a small
number and work upwards . We -must take
care i n selection of the oontaoters. I
am hoping to bring i n one or two older
and more experienced peo pie l i k e the »
Wardens and Treasurers i n on the select-
ion pfas f a r as the sporting clubs are
concerned lam i n agreement with involving
them i n the soheme."
I t was proposed that the S.C.C. approve
of the exeoutive going ahead on the lines
l a i d down above; this was carried unan-
imously.
The Chairman reported that council
had made the following decisions on Col-
ours:-
1) Colours s h a l l be awarded f o r repr-
esent!tive competitive a c t i v i t i e s only
2) Athletic colours s h a l l be awarded
by oluba an the Athletic Cluba Committee
J) Social Colours s h a l l be awarded by
oluba on the Recreational and Social Clubs
Committees whioh take part i n represent-
ative competitive a c t i v i t i e s .
I t was thought that there should
be "some"form of recognition given to
people who contributed to corporate
college l i f e but who were not now eliga-
ble f o r colours and the Union General
Award, e.g. non playing secretaries of
sports teams , officers of Social and
reoreational oluba,and a motion to this
effect was sent to Council,
Brian Ford,
Hon. S e c S.C.C.
