BJ Selecterizes your Friday night
If you answer yes to any of these
questions then this article is ideal for
you.
1) Did you have a really bad time
at home over Easter?
2) Are you bored of all the exam
revision?
3) Are you looking for a very
cheap quality night out tonight?
4) Do you like music?
Well the perfect solution is just
around the corner in the last of this
years Ents carnivals this Friday.
The Summer Swing Ding your last
chance to enjoy yourself before
your exams or if you are completing
them the perfect end to those
countless weeks of work, now they
are finished. Although the regular
Friday night 'Atmosphere' discos
will still be running this is the last
of the big events the perfect
opportunity to catch up with all your
great mates after the Easter break.
This Swing Ding brings together
all forms of music and
entertainment in a bevy of frenzied
fun. We have deliberately scoured
the globe for an event which
encompasses all musical tastes.
Top of the bill of this glorious
adventure into musical nirvana is
the infamous Selector. Now before
you embarrass yourself and say
'Who?' look up their name in the
annals of rock/pop history. You
would do well to look under the
category of Ska. The selector were
the Kings and Queens of the Ska hill
in the late 70's and throughout the
80's. Along with other ska legends
such as The Specials, Madness and
The Beat they were responsible for
the entire ska movement and the
rise of 2 Tone records. Their hits
include 'On M y Radio' missing
Words 'Too Much Pressure' and
they play a strict ska sound that is
as poignant today as it ever was.
Certain to get you all to your feet
so that you'll be dancing so much
you had better bring a spare pair of
shoes as you are likely to wear one
pair out.
The dance music representatives
at this epic celebration of musk is
in the form of Ariel. Described in
the press as bringing together the
rough sounds of techno and hip hop
with undiluted hard hitting guitar
riffs and blissed out vocals into a
convincing overall sound. But
anyone who has seen them or saw
their recent appearance on 'The
Word' recendy will know this is just
music journo bullshit for excellent
band. They are the latest signings
to De-construction records and their
new EP 'Let It Slide' is being hotly
touted in Clubs of all type all over
the country.
Bringing up the rear are seasoned
Indi-pop band The Hearthrobs. One
of Gary Crowleys favourites at the
moment they are unlike the run of
the mill Indi-guitar bands they are
good! Described in the press as
'The Pixies with lots of 'F factor'
(Shagability to you dumbo)' they
are a band to keep an eye on. The
new single 'Worser' is causing a stir
in the Indi-pop world and is one of
the best tracks of this genre so far
this year.
To top it off is the openers for this
mammoth music masterpiece
calling themselves Gods Zoo. They
are nothing to do with The Cult
much more in the vein of Living
Colour or a Funk metal kind of
band. Currendy playing the London
circuit these talented musicians
produce a remarkable blend of
funky almost reggaeish backline
with blistering guitars and vocals
overlaid . A very good young band
on the circuit but not for long as
M T V and the star status associated
with it looms ominously on the
horizon.
So hopefully you will agree this
is a musical event for all tastes. But
music is not the only thing you will
be getting for your £4.00 advance,
£2.50 Ents Cards or £5.00 on the
door ( i f there are any tickets left).
There will be fairground attractions
so that you can exercise your other
appendages. Also back by immense
public demand will be the return of
the mighty Imperial Cocktails.
These have been especially brought
back to enhance the evenings
enjoyment and so you can get really
pissed (let's not beat around the
bush here!). The sublime Ents
discotheque has undergone
extensive refurbishment and will be
making its re-opening appearance as
well as the usual late bar until 2am.
Also later in the evening there will
be minibuses running to give free
trips home for women. The whole
euphonious spectacle will kick off
at 8pm sharp when there will be a
happy hour at the bar with all drinks
reduced by 20%.
