There's loads of these type going
around. Most of them are to be
found lurking in newsagents posing
as magazines with free CDs stuck
on them. This one is different.
Firstly they're honest, let's face
it, here we have a C D with a free
magazine. Logically it is therefore
found in record shops and goes for
around a tenner.
Secondly, they're a different
shape. The magazine, all 192 pages
of it, is C D size, with the C D
lodged in the back cover. Nice for
storing with your other bits of
plastic. If you're a fan of record
sleeves/case inserts, this is the
ultimate.
Then we have the music. Lots of
it compares with your average CD-
magazine. (This volume 17 tracks,
almost 80 minutes of music). Also,
all up-to-date, otherwise
unavoidable versions of songs of
established, up and coming and
obscure indie/new wave bands
(Gallon Drunk, Unmen, Senseless
Things, Bjork...).
Altogether a well thought out,
bargain priced package but...Well
when you buy a compilation you
might expect to hear the tunes you
hear in your favourite clubs, or in
the charts (indie or otherwise) not
random album tracks. Some people
might view this as a drawback
however, I didn't mind, afterall
every song is new the first time you
hear it and these will soon be
buzzing around in your head as the
trendier one did mere days before.
Well happy and impressed.
FOB.
I won't warn you again about reading these pointless
bits of text. If you don't stop, I'll have to to use more
forceful launguage and ruder words, like 'cunt', for
instance
Hello there! Do you know Mike Chamberlain?.

d c Basehead/David Gray
— P o w e r h a u s
Emotive and gritty, David Gray
embodies the soul-searching power
of Van Morrison, the simplicity
breeding such incredible depth and
though angry, the subtle hints of
remorse make it overwhelming.
Such that by the end of the set, it
unashamedly reduced me to tears.
When the first single 'Birds Without
Wings' came out, he actually
sounded morose and I never even
bothered lifting an eyelid, but
purely on the strength of this
performance, his new album will no
doubt be a gem, sparkling for all it's
worth, but alas only to critical
acclaim. Though this sounds too
reactionary, in my heart of hearts,
it will no doubt rank alongside
Love's 'Forever Changes', Nick
Drake's 'Five Leaves Left' and
Van's 'Astral Weeks'—no obvious
single material, but timeless and
classic—perfect for 4am misery.
CD's are inappropriate and do not
do justice to David Gray, but vinyl
may capture that rawness lingering
in the air tonight.
Respect is due as he has
supported an eclectic variety of
artists such as the Balanescu
Quartet, Miranda Sex Garden and
now, dc Basehead.
Spiritually cool vibes and funky
motifs with unbelievable lightness
pervade this set, lead Michael
prancing around on stage
exclaiming obscenitites and at times
improvising. Crowd pleaser no
doubt, refuting the claims of
misogyny about his new album, but
political polemics and that mellow
factor, a little too distinct for my
liking—more Digable Planets like
coherence could be better.
dc Basehead were enjoyable, but
for my conscience, David Gray
remains untouchable.

An orgy of sounds, explosive,
abrasive and devastating; Joe the
Lion guitar snarls, power drill
guitar screeches—these guys really
know how to redefine their
instruments, changes in tempo and
swirling Tardis-like effects play
with your conscious and lift your
feet off the ground. It's like being
given a training course at NASA,
except it happens in the space of
forty minutes. Jack's solid
drumming, Ajay's awesome
presence, V i d and Nick's
intertwining 6-string machine guns
leave you wondering who the front
person is—that I believe is the
whole point.
If accessible music is your thing,
then stay at home and watch
yourself zombify in front of the tele,
GSV are only for the mental elite
and it should stay that way. With
a name such as theirs', and
considering they like to leave it on
backstage walls and plenty of toilet
cubicles over London's venues,
they deserve the attention however
unorthodox.
Suddenly I'm there at the front,
unaware at what has just hit me. For
the moment, the unsigned GSV are
just waiting, waiting to infect a
large aount of people.

Jam-packed and selling out early,
it left some very unhappy punters.
A drunk, bedraggled man was given
unnecessary rough treatment by
'ardkore bouncers, his crime was to
try to get into a full house. All right,
he was intoxicated and maybe a
little unsteady, but whisked off by
the police? A real benefit for the
homeless, no doubt.
What the gig was like I wouldn't
know, the guest list was stopped at
9pm, ten minutes before I arrived
and I couldn't get in—turning up
any earlier would've been very un
rock 'n' roll. When confronted by
an N M E hack and myself, an
'official' blatantly ignored Felix and
by pulling some preferential strings
left me darker than my already
sombre mood. And at the least it
could've been a spiritual gig...
Wiiija, with great bands from
Brighton, Leicester and Bury St
Edmunds (or so I've heard) deserve
all the attention, whether or not they
may be using charity as a platform
to promote themselves; but for
tonight's door policy enforced by
the Powerhaus people—FUCK
OFF A N D DIE Y O U WANKERS.
