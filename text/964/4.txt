Shurely Shome mishtake? Shooting season
Dear Private Eye,
Now that the sports centre has
been completed (?) can you tell us
if the instigators of the whole affair,
G Marshall and V Straw have
Ragnarok
Dear Jonty,
We have been following the
recent politico-religious debate
between members of the Imperial
College Conservative and Islamic
Societies, and we feel that it is
imperative that the scope of the
debate should be widened to take in
a broader range of religious
backgrounds. We refer of course to
those most outspoken devotees of
Thor, Wodin (Odin) and Loki
collectively known as Wodinites
and the members of the proposed
WodinSoc.
Let us consider the issues raised
in earlier letters; the question of law
and order could well be answered
by many more individuals dying
gloriously in battle and going to
Valhalla, thus finding an avenue to
channel their aggressions, but
where does that leave us in
Northern Ireland? It's enough of a
bloodbath already without involving
a load of bloody great battle-axes.
Wodinism singularly fails to
recognise the economic
complexities of modern Europe, or
take account of the needs of
twentieth century man. How can the
tried and truseted methods of rape,
pillage and dismemberment work in
society today? These ideas really
seem more suited to another place
and another time, and the possibility
of a European roasted-boar
bought season tickets yet. I think we
should be told.
Yours faithfully,
Simon Fraser, Management PG.
mountain is, we think you will
agree, a chilling one. As for laying
the spoils of war at the feet of the
King instead of paying taxes, well,
all systems have good points, but
we just can't picture Prince Charles
in a bear skin and horned helmet.
The incessant desires of the
Wodinites to seek out new lands to
conquer, terrorise and die
gloriously in, seems to understate
the concept of a coherent European
whole and the entire principle of
religious and racial tolerance is
swept under the moose-hide rug.
The Wodinites claim that
modern-day Scandinavian countries
such as Sweden and Norway cannot
be described according to the
classical model of idealistic
Wodinite states. But what about the
strong-arm tactics used during the
European football championships to
control football hooligans?
This said, we will personally
contribute to the air-fare back to,
Scandinavia of any Wodinite who
is sufficiently dissatisfied with
British beliefs and customs that they
wish to leave. Providing, of course,
they are prepared to travel by
Thor's Magic Hammer Airlines
Inc.
G Keogh and J Morgan.
P.S. You didn't predict this one,
did you, so-called F J Dodd?
Dear Editor,
May I use the pages of your organ
to inform the officers of Imperial
College Rifle and Pistol Club that
their firearms are now safely inthe
new armoury and as of now Angus
Fraser and myself are no longer
Bailees of their property. I should
also like to thank Gordon Baker of
the Artists Rifles Clubhouse Bisley
for putting up with storing the said
firearms for the last eight months
without any cost to Club or College
even though the building works
took three months longer than
promised.
Finally I should like to thank the
people who helped me to re-equip
the armoury, Paul Woods and Keith
Fraser and express my gratitude to
Jill Farmer of Biochemistry for the
use of the van and apologise for its
late return.
Yours,
Nick Royall, Geology Staff.

Planting the flowers on a tired debate
Dear Jonty,
The Fruits of Islam.
In response to recent articles on
Islam, particularly 'How to save
your soul' in your February 26
issue. I was interested to read of no
less than eight bad fruits, produced
by the tree of western civilisation
as an indication that Islam is the
right way.
The root of this fruit being
'freedom and benefit' giving rise to
selfishness. Let us look at the other
tree for a moment. When one
speaks of freedom, one must be
careful not to associate it with Islam
for the two never shall meet. You
need only look at the deadened eyes
of women in chadors who are
permitted no identity, respectâ€”and
any beauty that they do have is
carefully hidden. The Quran
advises men...that as for women
from which they fear disobedience,
they should admonish them, send
them to their beds apart and beat
them.
Islam can no longer call America
or any other western country the
Great Satan, their problems are
much closer to home. To look at
Islam, is to me to see a flower
plucked, where rigid legalism has
replaced freedom, where 'fatwas'
have replaced mercy.
There is hope, one of the 44
Islamic Republics have replaced the
Shah's symbol of sword-wielding
lion with the symbol of a tulip. But
as for the others and their continued
oppression of all that is spontaneous
and beautiful, one can see that a
loving God does not put the sap in
this tree.
A Tulip Lover.
Dear Jonty,

'...However the attempts by

I am a fundamentalist, I believe
through using my mind that a
creator exists and that the Koran is
from Allah. I am intellectually
convinced that it is the truth and I
invite all you 'free-liberal thinkers'
to rationally assess whether you
think there is creator or not and
Although it genuinely pains me to
do this, it is about time this debate
closed. I do appreciate that many
people have strong feelings on the
role of Islam and how the west
deals with Muslim cultures, but,
at present, the arguements seem
going round in circles.
If you really do wish to add
whether the Koran is from God or
not.
I once again ask the Conservative
Society to debate with us. The
debate could be arranged and
chaired by the Debating Society.
Are the Conservative Society
only capable of taking cheap shots
at Islam in Felix or can they
intellectually defend their belief and
way of life.?
Harun al-Rahid, Member of
Islamic Society.
anything further to this
disscusion, I will allow
you five minuites of my precious
time to convince me why your
opinion needs to be heard. If I'm
convinced the letter will be
printed, otherwise this tedious
arguement is at an end.
