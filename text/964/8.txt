LSD - Tripping the tests of time
Two weeks ago Hyde Park was the scene of a strange, colourful and
flamboyant anniversary. Phillip Henry describes the scene and Jonty
Beavan fills us in on the history of the chemical background to the party
On the 18th of April, at speakers'
corner in Hyde Park, there was a
celebration of the 50th anniversary
of LSD. Approximately a thousand
people attended along with a
considerable number of police.
The event that they were
celebrating took place on 16th April
1943. A young and brilliant!
graduate of the University of
Zurich, complained of dizziness and
left work at the Sandoz laboratories
in Switzerland early. Upon
returning home experienced what
he later recorded in his diary as,
' A n uninterrupted stream of
fantastic pictures, extraordinary
shapes with intense kaleidoscopic|
play of colours'.
Unable to pin down what had
caused this unusual experience, he j
came to the conclusion that it must I
have been contact with a substance
that he had been working on. The
chemical was a derivative of wheat
ergot he had discovered five years1
earlier in 1938. The scientist, Dr
Albert Hoffman, had named the
compound LSD-25.
Amazed by the intensity of the
effects and that the rigorous
laboratory conditions meant only a
tiny amount could possibly have
been ingested, D r Hoffman
resolved to investigate further. On
April 19th 1943 he took 0.25
milligrams of LSD-25 dissolved in
a glass of water as a self
experiment.
After being overcome with
extreme confusion Dr Hoffman
returned home by bicycle
accompanied by his laboratory
assistant. During this journey the
now well recorded symptoms ofi
LSD became obvious. Overcome
by fear and a belief that he had lost
his mind Albert Hoffman spent the
remaining time under the influence
of the drug believing that a demon
had invaded his body and his
neighbour was a 'malevolent,
insidious witch, with a coloured ]
mask'. By the time a doctor had
arrived, Dr Hoffman had returned
to relative coherence, but remained
anxious that he could have poisoned
himself. As dilated pupils were the
only evidence of ill health that the
Doctor could find, Hoffman was
sent to bed to recover.
Apart from condemnation of
irresponsible research techniques,
Why are banners like this one banned? The bearers of this one aren't sure.
Hoffman's colleagues were amazed
at such minute amounts having such
enormous results. Research on the
mysterious substance continued and
attempts were made to apply the
peculiar effects for medical use.
Treatment of mentally ill patients
with what was described as a
'pyschoactive drug' appeared to
have a positive effect. Terminally
ill cancer patients who could no
longer respond to pain relieving
drugs were completely relieved of
suffering after ingesting LSD.
At the same time as this research
was continuing, another side of
LSD was coming to the fore. The
late 1950s and early 1960s saw LSD
becoming the plaything of a
generation interested only in
challenging the existing order. Art,
books and most famously of all, the
hippy movement were inspired and
motivated by the drug.
Uncontrolled experimentation on
the scale that took place during the
1960s was to have consequences,
Mental Hospitals were filled with
wards of 'Acid Casualties' who had
overindulged on the chemical. It
was not long before LSD became
a controlled substance.
Hyde Park two weeks ago
became the centre of activity for the
remnants and rejects from the 'Love
Generation'. The rumour that Dr
Hoffman would appear and speak
to the crowd proved false but the
proceedings went fairly quietly.
Besides the usual bunch of
eccentrics who accumulate
regularly around this area such as
evangelists, black militants and
general loudmouths, there was, on
this particular occasion, a soap box
for advocates of the legalisation of
the drug. However, the large
majority simply came to associate
with people of a similar disposition
just for a chat and a good time.
Rather than being a large mass of
bodies the crowd were separated
into smaller groups which
congregated around epicentres of
activity. These were dealers, groups
indulging in tribal dancing to home-
made, extemporaneous beat or
smiling hippies who, judging by the
various smells that were wafting
across the park, were openly
smoking pot. The whole
atmosphere was party-like, friendly
and open, with a surfeit of shiny,
happy people.
When the inevitable arrest did
take place the situation changed to
one of anger and a concentration of
police formed around the accused
to stop the gathering crowd of
several hundred rescuing him.
Rather surprisingly no violence
erupted but, instead, there were a
few irate words exchanged. When
the police presence dissipated the
celebratory atmosphere returned.
A rumour circulated that there
would be a rave after the carnival
but despite questioning random
individuals, nobody seemed to
know exactly where it was. One
person was eager in pointing out
that it was not an illegal rave
because there would be no dancing
- officially. This is a convenient
legal loophole that would have
allowed the event to take place
without any police interference.
Sale of the substance was discreet
even if the users were not; one
particular speaker was loudly
extolling the virtues of the drug and
informing us of his more unusual
revelations which included all
trippers partying on the planet
Venus thus explaining why
scientists have yet to penetrate the
atmosphere with radar. The
listening police looked on with
bemused expressions and exhibited
a fairly relaxed attitude to the
harmless ramblings of this strange
man. Despite this, the speaker
warned that at dusk he would have
to run home since the 'Thought
Squad Division' were after him...
The crowds started to disappear
from half past five onwards and
everybody seemed to have enjoyed
themselves, but in San Francisco
the atmosphere was reportedly far
more intense with larger numbers
of people attending and activities
planned to take the crowd late into
the night.
