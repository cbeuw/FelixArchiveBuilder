Free radical
by D e c l a n Curry
The prize for this week's Felix
competition has been sponsored by
William Waldegrave, the Science
Minister. In a call for better
understanding of science, M r
Waldegrave told reporters in
Brighton that he would give a bottle
of vintage champagne to anyone
who can tell him what the Higgs
boson is, and why they want to find
it.
Entries must be on one side of a
single sheet of A4 paper, and must
be posted to William Waldegrave,
Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, Office of Public Service
and Science, Cabinet Office, 70
Whitehall, London, SW1A. Entries
may also be left with Rose or Jonty
at the Felix office, for faxing to Mr
Waldegrave. The closing date for
entries is 1 June 1993. The
champagne will be provided out of
Mr Waldegrave's pocket.
An interview with Professor Tom
Kibble, a former Head of Physics
at Imperial and one of the
discoverers of the wretched particle
is on page 9 of this week's Felix.
A Waldegrave-friendly answer
form will be printed in next week's
Felix. Order NOW at your local
Union office.

Jobs flop
by D e c l a n Curry
Unemployment among Imperial
College graduates is rising more
rapidly than at other colleges,
according to figures just released.
Despite this rise, the figures show
that unemployment among
Imperial's graduates is still much
lower than for the country as a
whole.
Official figures issued jointly by
the Government Statistical Service
and the Department for Education
show that, nationally, 13.2% of
1991 graduates were still
unemployed at the end of December
of that year. At the same point in
1990, only 8.8% of 1990 graduates
were believed unemployed.
Meanwhile, Imperial College
Planning Unit figures show that
5.8% of 1991 Imperial graduates
were 'seeking employment' at the
end of December 1991. Only 3.3 %
of Imperial's Class of 1990 were
jobless by Christmas of 1990. This
year-on-year percentage change of
75% for Imperial graduates is
considerably higher than the
national 1991/90 percentage change
of 51%.
Fluttering millions Heads Screwed
by D e c l a n Curry
Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley, facing another storm
over the Tomlinson Report, has
opened a mobile cardiac laboratory
at St Mary's Hospital.
The heart unit, the first such
facility within the National Health
Service, will be used to carry out
heart tests at local hospitals. Mrs
Bottomley said the unit will help the
NHS in London 'meet the challenge
of providing a more accessible
service for patients.'
Meanwhile, doctors have claimed
that £170 million extra money
promised by Mrs Bottomley for
London patient care is a 'myth'.
Medical journal 'Pulse' reports that
money for implementing the
Tomlinson plans for London health
care is being diverted from other
parts of the country. Mrs Bottomley
said in February that the £170
million would be 'additional
expenditure on capital projects
which will bring London's primary
care services up to an appropriate
standard.'
Dr Peter Scholar, a Camden GP
and member of group charged with
introducing the Tomlinson Report,
told IC Radio that after meeting
Department of Health officials he
had 'no idea where the money was
coming from'. Dr John Chisholm,
GP negotiator at the British Medical
Association, said that the medical
profession had been dealt a 'three
card trick'.

Professor H Worthington has been
appointed Head of the Department
of Geology, succeeding Professor
R Selley. His term of office extends
from 1 July 1993 to 31 August
1998.
Other senior staff announcements
see both Professor W Wakeham and
Professor I Aleksander, having
their appointments extended to 31
August 1996. Professor Wakeham
is currently the Head of the
Departments of Chemical
Engineering and Chemical
Technology whilst Professor
Aleksander is the Head of the
Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering.
The Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) says it
has been 'screwed to the wall' by
'tight' Government funding. The
claim was made after the Council
refused funding to Professor Sir
Geoffrey Wilkinson, the Nobel
prize winner still working at
Imperial's Chemistry Department.
Professor Wilkinson applied for
£30,000 to pay for a post-doctorate
researcher, chemicals and
equipment. Sir Geoffrey, who won
the Nobel Prize in 1973, says he
sent the rejection slip to his M P .
The SERC says that it can only
afford one third of chemistry
projects submitted for funding.
Blatch to the drawing board
by D e c l a n Curry
An Imperial Governor was part of
an academic ambush which last
week forced a headlong
Government retreat on its latest
schools Bill.
Lord Adrian, a Crown-appointed
member of Imperial's Governing
Body, told Education Minister
Baroness Emily Blatch that
Government plans to extend the
powers of Education Secretary,
John Patten, were 'beyond the
scope' of the new Education Bill.
The Imperial Governer added that
he was 'unsure' of the Education
Secretary's motives.
This attack, and a threatened
Conservative revolt forced the
Minister to rescind her proposals to
extend the Education Secretary's
executive powers over education in
England and Wales. The
climbdown took place in the House
of Lords, during the Committee
stage of the 1992 Education White
Paper.
Although the Bill re-organises
primary and secondary education,
university chiefs became embroiled
in a row with the government after
John Patten, the Education
Secretary, introduced a new clause
to the Act last February. Known as
'Clause One', the new wording
instructed the Education Secretary
'to exercise his powers' over
publicly funded bodies which 'carry
responsibility for education in
England and Wales'.
Academics were outraged at what
many saw as a secretive
Government attempt to restrict
academic freedom, and to dictate
what they could teach. University
vice chancellors said that they were
'puzzled and concerned' by the new
clause, and demanded the 'specific
exclusion' of higher education
institutions from the new schools
bill.
The Government front bench
clashed with senior Conservative
and Liberal Democrat peers, who
said that the new law would 'leave
universities vulnerable to
interference by the Government'.
Rebel peers were joined by
academics in the Upper Chamber,
who expressed concern about
academic freedom. Academic
freedom was last discussed in the
House of Lords last year, when the
peers defeated Government plans to
allow the Education Secretary to
impose conditions on university
grants, and to link university
funding to the use of academic time.
One peer, Lord Simon of Glaisdale,
said that Clause One was the
Government's fourth attempt since
1988 to undermine academic
freedom.
Baroness Blatch told the peers
that she was withdrawing the clause
in order to meet university fears.
Earlier, the Baroness had insisted
that the plans did not give the
Education Secretary new powers
over universities.
