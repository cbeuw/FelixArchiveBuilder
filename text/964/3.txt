Blood, tears and charred bodies,
just some of the special effects
brought to us over the past few
weeks by Balkan-vision. Working
through out ex-Yugoslavia, Balkan
vision TV has achieved new heights
of horror, original depths of
despair, a technicolour panorama of
the worst in the human condition.
Parents, make sure your children
are locked up in bed when this
raunchy shocker howls across
Logie Baird's brain child, because
we are not sure if they could cope
with this X-rated production.
As B V T V enters every home of
the civilised world, M r and Mrs
Nuclear Family react. He grits his
teeth and resolves that if he were
there it would all be different; 'we
would show them what for', he
mutters. She sheds tears of silent
horror at the mutilation, thanking
God that it is not her children that
are caught in the killing fields. And
in the village and the town, a cry
rises up, 'we do not want this to
happen', they shout, 'do
something', they echo; the people
are speaking.
In the halls of power, deep
southern indecision is rife, grey
compromise does not answer the
questions. They know that a people
that held the Nazis at bay for four
years can not be easily persuaded
to go home and sup cocoa with their
rivals. They know that each action
has a reaction, and the body bags
will soon fill with election-losing
British soldiers instead of unknown
peasants from a foreign land.
There is no conspiracy, just plain
uncertainty, no right and plenty of
wrongs. The great Satan and Moral
Guardian of the planet can see no
achievable objective; there will be

no action, just delay. But all the
time the West is being dragged in
deeper and deeper, more troops,
more aid, more sanctions. Until the
fateful time that our soldiers are
killed or maimed, then with a
backlash of wounded pride, we will
join the war that few want and
fewer understand.
Sometimes the most cynical
alternative seems to be the best:
Don't let anybody in or out of the
former Yugoslavia, block off the
borders, and leave them to it. When
the embattled parties come to a
natural peace or there is no one left
to fight, resume the usual
diplomatic ties and relations. But
who could stand by and let humans
barbecue each other? Does anyone
possess the calculating inhumanity
to do this? Who will look across the
blackened battle ground, as the
smoke clears, see the piles of
ethnically cleansed bodies and say
Opinion

it was all for the best?
There is no answer, all I can say
is, as a pretender to the media that
will bring every bloodstain and
broken limb in your living room, I
am glad I don't have to decide.

Dear Sir,
I would be grateful if you could
find space for the following memo
in the next edition of Felix:
'Many thanks to the two blokes
who left their guitars and valiantly
pursued a thief through the union
and across Beit Quad on my behalf
on Monday 15.3.93. I am glad to
say the thief ditched both bag and
jacket in his hurry to escape.
Many thanks also to the honest
person who found the abandoned
effects and took them to the Union
Office. You are all appreciated. It
was more than I imagined or prayed
for to have everything returned.
Thanks a lot.
Yours faithfully,
Helen Vaughan.
Cat's Eyes
I would like to begin, if I may, by
setting the record straight on a few
points:
I am not going to edit Broadsheet
despite the rumour that was flying
about last term and which is still
very much alive. Clues to the
creator of this cruel gossip would
be greatly appreciated.
In Felix 963, I did predict, with
odds of 5/2, that an outsider to the
Islam affair would write, and indeed
they have. M r / M r s / M i s s / M s
whateveryournameis, and friend,
failed to recognise this and insisted
on adding the prefix 'so-called' to
my name. Why, I don't know.
Lack of space in bygone Felices,
all be it my fault, prevented from
clearing up the misunderstanding
about my views on Dep Reps. They
do a bloody good job, and I never
said otherwise. What I said or
meant to say was that I thought the
level of responsibility was small in
comparison to that of IC President.
Hence the line '...major
responsibility NOT..' was used in
Cat's Eyes in Felix 959. M y
opinion could be wrong, however,
and any cretin could quite easily get
elected, Dep Rep or not a Dep Rep,
and do the job with little ease.
Apologies to anyone who was
offended by the Malcolm X article
some time last term. Many thanks
to Cecile who wrote in to point out
a few grievances that black people
may have had about the article.
Nearly the e n d
Only 8 weeks until the summer
hols. Some of you may have started
your exams already, while others,
like me, have exams in the last
couple of weeks. Whatever your
situation, the academic year is
nearly over.

Shit idea! Why not spend the
millions it would cost for this
project to succeed on tracking down
the perpetraitors of those
bombings? The 'Make London
Safe' plan, as highlighted in most
papers earlier this week, is
impractical, costly and not the best
solution to an ever increasing
problem.
U n i o n S t e w a r d s
Someone sent me a rather odd
riddle or joke or whatever you want
to call it; it goes something like this:
'Q— Why do Union Stewards were
their radios in their back pockets ?
A — So they have both hands free
for talking.' Hmmm.

Felix is famous (sort of). We got a
mention in the diary column of the
Guardian earlier this week, because
we have an interview with
Professor Somebody, who lets lose
a few clues as to what a Haggis
boson is. Why should anyone care
what one is? There is a prize of a
bottle of vintage champers for the
best/correct answer. Want to know
how to enter, read a few pages on...
