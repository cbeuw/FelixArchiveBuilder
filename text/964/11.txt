While Mike Chamberlain takes a camera firmly in hand to shoot and tell
the spectator's story of the London marathon
'I've got a job for you' said Jonty,
'Go and take photos of Alex
miming the marathon'. No problem
I thought, get up, cycle across
London, point and shoot, what's so
hard about that? Nothing really,
apart from the start of the marathon
is 9.00am, the other side of
London, the other side of the river,
in zone five; it might as well be the
other side of the world.
I set my alarm for 6.30am, I
ignore it and go back to sleep.
7.15am, oh shit, I'm late already
and I'm not even up yet -I get up,
I grab my camera, lenses, film,
more film and a bag to put it in and
set off across London on my bike.
I get to college and wait for Jonty,
its 8.00am. Having said he would
like to come he could have the
decency to turn up. 8.15am; No
sign of Jonty, I cannot hang around
any longer, leaving a message for
him, I set off across London.
Crossing the river at Blackfriars,
I manage to pick up the marathon
route marked by a blue line at the
far side of Tower Bridge. At least
now I know I am going in the right
direction. I get to the Cutty Sark at
9.00; its packed already, everybody
in London seams to have decided
that this was a good place to watch
as well. I look around for a decent

vantage point to no avail, the
official marathon press have all the
best spots, and with out a 'Marathon
Media' pass I have no chance. Oh
well impromptu press scrum time;
Get out of the way you Fat
American Tourist. I struggle to a
get a decent position; too late Liz
McColgan runs past in the lead and
all I can see is the back of some
granny's head. I move to the side
and get a decent view. 10.00am, A
cheer goes up, its the lead men -1
point my camera, aim, and fire off
a few shots, nothing amazing and
not what I came here for, but its a
start. I wait; 10.18, some guy runs
up and kisses his girlfriend, it must
be the start of the fun runners, I
catch a glimpse of Alex as he runs
past - I give him a cheer, at least
now I know where abouts he is
running - he's on for a good time.
I dive on to my bike and start
heading back to Tower Bridge, no
easy ride this time, 35,000 other
people all want to use the road at
the same time and I don't appear in
Old, fat Eamonn Martin, the eventual winner in second place during the race.
their plans, I move on to the back
streets, diving in and out of river
side walks and doing more U-turns
than a Tory Government, as I reach
deadend after deadend. I get to
Tower Bridge just in time to see
Alex run past - no time for a photo
call here, its photogenic but packed
solid. I move down a side road to
catch the later stages of the course,
100 metres for me, 7 miles for the
competitors. The women's leaders
had just run through and Liz was in
3rd - serves you right for being so
cocky think I.
1 move round to get a decent
vantage point at one of the less
popular viewing points, I am
shooting across a b.end and I get a
decent angle on the lead men as they
run through, I run off 5 shots in two
seconds thanks to the motor drive
and focus prediction on my camera.
That's more like it I think, now to
get some shots of Alex. Crossing
under the track using a Hotel car-
park, I fast talk my way past a
marshall to acquire a new vantage
point. Now I can see any on coming
runners and there's not a fat
American tourist in sight. I wait,
more runners, I recognise some of
the faces who where ahead of Alex
at the Cutty Sark. Alex is late, he
has slowed down by about 15
minutes. I catch sight of him in the
corner of my eye as he comes into
view; keeping him in the centre of
the shot all the time I fire as many
photos as I can.
Once back on my bike, I head
along Embankment, up to
Westminster bridge again, the
finish, more waiting, more runners;
Alex is late, very late, I assume I
have missed him when the first of
the chicken suits passes me, I head
home.
