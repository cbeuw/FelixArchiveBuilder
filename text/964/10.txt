Easy like Sunday morning...
Alex Taverner, a second year chemist at IC ran this year's London
Marathon. Hoping to raise Â£1,200for TUSK FORCE, he retells the story
of his exertions below
It's the Big Day. Oh shit, why am
I doing this? This is possibly the
second most stupid thing that I have
ever done - the first was turning up
for the Liverpool Marathon last
year. Oh well, it's too late to back
out now and besides, I'm running
for charity this year. I finally get up,
Oh God, it's dark hundred hours.
I got to the start early and froze
in the cold and wind - who says that
Blackheath is pleasant on a Sunday
morning? At 0730hrs? The number
of keen faces around me is
appalling; Are they stupid? Are they
suicidal? The Elite race started and
we waited around for ours, absent
mindedly adjusting shoes, running
numbers and frozen appendages.
The whistle blows, and we all
respond by not moving for two
minutes whilst those in front of us
start running... .three minutes later
we cross the start line.
There are water stops each mile;
a bit of quick mental arithmetic 26.2
times 250ml = about 6.5 litres to
drink. How much are we going to
sweat?
The first half goes easily; at the
half way point I see the clock at 1
hour 24 minutes. Subtract 3 minutes
for the start, multiply by one and
a bit, equals about 2 hours 50
minutes. Brilliant! Mile 16 comes
and goes, and then so do my legs.
Cramps set in for the duration and
by Mile 18, I'm on time for 3 hours
10 minutes. The cramps get really
bad by Mile 20 and I have already
seen lots of people dropping out
because of them; the winds around
the Isle of Dogs did not help. I wave
to Mike (him with camera) a few
times then get back to the matter in
hand and promptly trip over a
drinks bottle. A few more people
wave as I go by and I grin to them.
I'll be back...
The Embankment, Trafalgar
Square, The Mall - almost home!
I see the fountain outside
Buckingham Palace and nobody's
going to stop me now! Top gear -
it takes six minutes to complete the
final mile and my legs are giving
way; they're shagged. It's time for
tea, medals and hospitalisation.
After recovering, I took an hour
completely failing to find the
gorgeous young lady who came to
see me finish this race (it later
transpired that I kept looking the
wrong way when I went past her
over Westminster Bridge!). The
race over, I stay to cheer home a
few more hundred mad, impetuous
fools and go home. Oh well, 3
hours 27 minutes hard work and it's
all over for another year. The true
horror comes later when I tend to
my feet and find out that I have
ripped the muscles in my legs to
buggery. Anything in a good cause
(well, nearly...)!
Thanks to all those who helped
me train, sponsored me and came
to see me run.
Special thanks: Cathy, Mat., Jonty,
Mike, Emma, Alison, Phil(i),
Rachel, Jane and the Felix crew.
STOP-PRESS: Just wait until the
Berlin Marathon later on this
year.....
Our hero striding through the pain barrier.
