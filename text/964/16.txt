Felix 964 30 April 1993
L S O — Y u r i B a s h m e t
The London Symphony Orchestra's
spring season ended with a short
series of concerts featuring the
virtuoso violist Yuri Bashmet.
Exciting and challenging
programming has become a
hallmark of LSO festivals, and the
Bashmet series was no exception.
The music ranged from the
Classical to the contemporary, and
included the world premiere of
Alexander Tchaikovsky's engaging
and eclectic Etudes in Ordinary
Tones. Bashmet's beautiful and
varied tonal palette went from rich
lyricism in the Walton concerto
(conductor Valery Gergiev could
have been more idiomatic here) to
the intense final statement of
Shostakovich. His awesome viola
sonata made its full impact despite
one or two slow tempi.
The LSO start their summer
season onthe 5th May with
Bruckner's Fourth Symphony under
Sir Georg Solti.

T h e Q u e e n of S p a d e s
The construction of Tchaikovsky's
last symphony is the work of a
skillful dramatist, and few who
know the Pathetique will be
surprised at the masterful theatrical
pacing of the composer's setting of
Pushkin's 'The Queen of Spades',
revived by the E N O during April.
Tchaikovsky identified closely
with the central character,
Hermann, a tormented outsider who
is torn between his love for the rich
noblewoman Lisa and the obsession
G r o u n d H o g P a y
The film is set in small-town USA
where Phil (Bill Murray), a self-
centred and arrogant reporter, finds
himself covering 'Ground Hog
Day'. Anyway Phil, his producer
Rita (Andie McDowell) and the
cameraman try to leave town the
same day, but are held up by a snow
storm (actually something
beginning with 'b' but I can't spell
it), so they return to town to stay
the night. When Phil arises the next
morning, to his horror he finds
himself reliving Ground Hog Day.
with gambling which eventually
destroys him. David Pountney's
production is psychological rather
than naturalistic; billowing, opaque
drapes suggest the mists of insanity
invading Hermann's mind. The set,
a raised semicircular colonnade,
remains unchanged throughout the
opera, which involves the relocation
of Lisa's suicide from the banks of
the river to the Countess's
bedroom, with some loss of
atmosphere.
Music Director designate Sian
Edwards draws a beautifully
blended sound from the orchestra,
preferring to hint at rather than
spotlight instrumental textures. The
subtle accompaniment to Peter
Sidhom's excellent singing makes
enthralling listening of Tomsky's
Act I aria. In Act II, no less
compelling is the old Countess as
she recalls her youth as the Venus
of Moscow, toast of Parisian high
society; a true pianissimo from
Patricia Payne and the merest glint
of muted brass in the orchestra.
Graeme Matheson-Bruce
captures the complexity of
Hermann, but is a little
underpowered. Janice Cairns is an
accurate, strong-voiced Lisa.

In truth Phil must relive Ground
Hog Day until he gets the day just
right.
This is an enjoyable film which
is in essence about how Bill Murray
must pull Andie McDowell in order
to end a particularly nasty day (by
virtue of the fact that he must relive
it so often). In order to do so, Phil
must turn himself into Rita's ideal
man (charming, intelligent, caring,
plays a musical instrument, humble
and other stuff). Though the
reformation of Phil is a bit annoying
(and predictable), Phil's abuse of
his own particular brand of
imortality makes up for this.
On the whole it's worth seeing.

R o g u e Warrior
by Richard M a r c i n k o
This autobiography is like no other
that I have ever read; it seems like
an adventure thriller of the military,
but is in actual life written by an
American ex-Navy Captain. This
man was responsible for the
conception, establishment and
training of one of the world's top
C R W (Counter Revelutionary
Warfare) teams, SEAL Team Six.
The book starts by reciting a mishap
at 19000 feet, when his parachute
fails to open during a HAHO (High
Altitude High Opening) deployment
on exercise. It improves.
The book continues to recite his
life from early on in his life when
he drops out from college (which he
calls Voluntary Disenrolement),
through his joining the navy and his
training through various special
warfare sections and his climb
through the ranks. It transfers all the
excitement of the situation at hand,
be it in Vietnam in the '70s to
testing the security at top Military
establishments throughout America
and abroad.
This man is a true maverick; a
brilliant leader and warrior in the
field of unorthadox Special Warfare
techniques. He is arrogant,
egocentric, obnoxious, violent,
brilliant. To some he is the ultimate
example of a bad officer - he drinks
with his men, he swears at
Admirals, he shits on senior
officers, but to others he is the
perfect warrior. He somewhat
extreme training methods are
frowned upon by the paper pushing
"Dip Dunk" staff officers but he
gets results which the much higher
up C N O (Commander of Navy
Operations) appreciates.
I found the book truly compelling
and if it were not for me already
being in the military, it would make
me feel like volunteering
immediately. A brilliant author. If
this book is well publicised I can
foresee it becoming a best seller.
Excellent. 10/10. For those of you
who read this book, remember:
Don't use "Goatfuck" as a noun!
