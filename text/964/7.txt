you don't want to be wandering
round with a hard-earned sweatshirt
or t-shirt with a naff slogan next
year, do you?
93 Off your tree
92 Bug-a-ewe
91 Elephants Come
90 Rampant Rhino
89 Dragons Divine
88 Lemmings Fate
87 Pigs in Heaven
We are now at that time of the year
when we have to vote on what the
slogan for next year is going to be,
and for this we need your helpful
suggestions. Listed below are a few
of the slogans for previous years,
most of them with an animal theme.
So, get thinking - and post your
ideas to Rag, either in the
pigeonhole in the Union office, or
in the Rag Office itself. After all,
Platypus
A quick note to all the parachutists,
although it will only mean
something to those that jumped on
the second weekend...' 'The fat cow
was in the swimming hyphen pool,
looking through the window at me.
I smelt like Jacuzzi, and a duck
Exam Escape
hyphen billed hyphen platypus
horse nut bolt. So I had to go in the
nude without any flumes."
P.s. get your money in soon!
P.p.s. that goes for you too,
bungee jumpers!
Yet again, the Rag committee
(being made up of such caring, kind
and generally luwerly people), has
got together a whole load of
distractions to take your stressed
minds off all that nasty revision.
For your convenience, here is a
selection from the multitude
available...
1st May Chelsea/Coventry, Help
the Aged 3-4th May Hothouse
Flowers 9th May QPR/Aston Villa
16th May F A Cup Final,
Parkinson's
When you've decided which of
these your life is not complete
without attending, take yourself
along to the Rag meeting on Friday
and find out the details. What better
way of escaping from all that exam
pressure than giving yourself a
well-earned break, and getting a
little closer to that next Rag
incentive at the same time?
Close Competition
The Halls competition will close on
the 7th May, and any receipts not
received by our wonderful
Treasurer, Mark, by this date will
not be put on the Hall totals. Sorry!
The winning team will be
announced, and the prize given, at
Rag Fete, so make sure you're
there. There is, of course,
absolutely no truth whatsoever in
the rumours that the prize will be
another barrel of beer. So there!
Guess again.

Internal Affairs Officer

I think Sharks Galore '94
is a crap slogan!
'94
is much better.
