M C 4 — I r o n S k y
I often wondered about people
wearing MC4 t-shirts. Strange
fellows thought 1.1 got rather more
excited on finding that one of their
LPs had a cover with a Hieronymus
Bosch painting on it.
Even if you're unsure about his
paintings, the name is surely
enough for instant sainthood. The
one thing led to another until I
found myself spinning 7"s of vinyl,
and desperately trying to look cool,
oh yeah I've got all their t-shirts,
LPs, baseball hats...
But to business. You get three
tracks for your money kids. A l l
packaged on nice light blue plastic.
The first one is the best, dead short
(2:52) and as chewy as a snail. The
lead singer can't sing but is soon
drowned by the guitars and it gets
better, even verging on good. The
last 30 seconds consists of feedback
and the middle includes the line
'and the rain fell like bullets from
a gun'. The front cover's ok but not
by 'His Holiness the Bosch'.
(Recommended action for the week,
invest in the aforementioned
'Sebastopol Road'. Even if you hate
the music, put the cover on your
wall and take down your 'Betty
Blue' poster. Who says we don't
give you advice?).

S a r a h Brightman — D i v e
The accompanying booklet contains
some photos, revealing in parts, of
sex-goddess diva Sarah Brightman.
So tantalising, my copy is now
unashamedly stuck together. Yeah,
right.
With tiresome similies between
tears and rain, the main theme on

Diverse and sparky, expect the
unexpected here. Duck and weave
the traditional.
Hyperhead are a very good pop
group that make lovely songs. They
never say rude words and if you like
their kind of music, then you'll
probably like the album. If you
don't like it, that's all right because
after all it's simply a question of
taste and it shouldn't reflect badly
on a person. And another thing -
everone's got a right to like what
P J Harvey, to whit, Stephen Vaughn, Polly Harvey, Robert Ellis,
Well, someone smells of photocopier fluid, and I'm damn sure it
isn't me'
charming, plump, and hot queer at
all, the landscapes are among the
most beautiful to be found in this
country, and the beer, the
strawberries, the clotted cream, are
all, mmm, tasty! And the music?

5 0 ft Q u e e n i e
Being a fellow of goodly disposition
and untraceable dialect, I would like
to say that I love the West Country,
for so it is true. The folk are
Hello! I am a gap between reviews. Please
'Dive' is water, manifesting itself
onto every song, but ever since Jimi
sang "Driftin' on a sea of forgotten
teardops...", any other attempt at
watery songwriting aesthetic,
notably this one, appear futile. In
fact, songs such as 'Seven Seas' and
'Ship of Fools' seem suspiciously
like secondhand titles, and are not
surprisingly shite. No doubt she can
sing, as often shown by her ex-
husband's commerical avarice, but
with squeaky clean production and
pathetic songsmithery, it is just
complete crass.
Talking of bad taste, a cover of
For those of you who did not get the above,
they want, and that's the bad thing
about music reviews because it
makes you feel a real stinker if you
like something a reviewer says
nasty things about. Music reviewers
are silly because they never see
things from everyone's point of
view. If people wanted to hear other
people's opinions on records, they
would ask their friends, not read
music reviews.
Remember, pretending to
understand things you don't, and
regurgitating the popular music
do not read me unless you are a ouanker.
Procoi Harum's ' A Salty Dog',
though intricately arranged, smells
like necrophilia, or to be more
precise, necrophiliac beastiality.
Hmmmmm. Could be fun, but
beware if you've got any cuts.
Anyway, is prog-rock cool and
vogue these days? Do you care?
Ms Brightman's new venture is
remarkably like a non-swimmer
diving into the deep blue, oh so
romantic sea, and drowning. Haha.
How's that for your beautiful
musical conscience, you Aqua Girl
Star.

that isi 'wanker' with an 'ou'
press doesn't make you a bad
person, just a transparent, sad,
fuking 'Let's go to Finsbury Park
-it'll be really fab' T-Shirt wearing,
camden palace, naive, spoddish
indie-pop twat with no consept of
what's going on around them, and
not worthy of proffering their
opinion on anything ever, or until
they get some living done, or
serious amount of social education
in a very short period of time.
Dangerously good record, I
would definitely buy a copy for
spankin' stiff-cocked metal bands.
The music's shit.

Hi! I'm Polly Jean from Ecstatic
Existential Poems R Us, and I've

stripped 'Sheela-Na-Gig', blew
'Dry', then you're nice, and I have
a special fondness for you. If, on
the other hand, you have never

arse for not paying attention. P A Y

Heh heh heh. Cranes, eh? So
where've you been for the past two
years, then? Sitting on some
slavering reviews of an
uncomfortably sexual nature, or just
going on a big, sexy, expensive tour
with the Cure, and letting Bob
Smith foot the bill for fags, beer,
make-up and taramosalata?
I'm trying to say, look, luvs, your
time has been and gone (looks at
watch thoughtfully, then casts eyes
heavenwards) ooh, about thirteen
months ago, and it's too late to do
anything about it now. You used to
be breast-deep in a gorgeous,
muddy doom, but you're all
marshmallow now. It's nice
marshmallow, but...
