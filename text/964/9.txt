Ripples in the universal pond
Jonty Beavan talks to Professor Tom Kibble about this year's Schrodinger
Lecture, which takes place on Thursday
Every year a thankless task is doled
out to a senior physics academic at
Imperial College, every year
someone has to persuade the
greatest names in Physics and
Mathematics to come and blind the
unwashed masses of South
Kensington with the brilliant glare
of their scientific insight. Fast
becoming a ritual here, the 1993
Schrodinger Lecture will take place
next Thursday 6th May in the Great
Hall and will be presented by
Professor Micheal Berry.
But what of this year's
masterplanner? Professor Tom
Kibble, ex head of the Department
of Physics here and the forgotten
half of the Higgs-Kibble Boson (An
elementary particle that it is hoped
will unify all the forces of nature),
has that role. Before allowing him
to unashamedly plug Micheal
Berry's lecture in the hallowed
pages of Felix, I asked Professor
Kibble about the background to an
event that has become a part of life
here.
The Schrodinger lectures started
after a conference held at Imperial
six years ago to celebrate the
centenary of Erwin Schrodinger's
birth, the gentieman responsible for
forcing the confusion of quantum
mechanics upon the world. Such a
success was the event, that the
organisers had the rare difficulty of
having a lot of money and not
knowing what to do with it. It was
decided that a lecture should be
organised one year later with a
prestigious speaker, again the
lecture received sponsorship and
allowed another speech to be held
the following year. Thursday's
lecture is no exception and is
sponsored by Taylor and Francis
Limited, thus insuring that we are
not lost for a lecture next year.
Although Schrodinger's work has
had far reaching consequences on
science in this century, promoting
these labours was not the aim of the
committee that arranged the
lectures. Instead the principle was
to generate interest in science by
directing the discussion at an
undergraduate audience.
Schrodinger himself was renowned
as a clear and charismatic speaker
when covering technical subjects,
having several books of his popular
lectures published in his lifetime.
And so, under the flag of
popularising science many of the
world's most famous and influential
scientists have entered Imperial
College to speech with our
undergraduates.
Steven Hawking came in 1989 to
put forward his opinions on
imaginary time. Mandelbrot spent
some time here in 1991 talking
about fractals. His lecture proved
to be so popular that the Great Hall
in the Sherfield building could not
cope and the event was moved to
Westminster City Hall. Although
mathematical sciences are always
going to a guiding force behind the
lectures, this is not always the case:
In 1990 Leslie Orgel chewed the fat
about the origins of life.
Micheal Berry the guest of
honour on Thursday, is a Royal
Society award professor at Bristol
University. His numerous academic
achievements include the Royal
Medal, the Paul Dirac Medal and
the Julius Edgar Lilienfield prize.

Although an eminent intellectual he
is renowned as an orator and his
constantly giving lectures around
the country. Best known for his
work on what is called 'Catastrophe
Theory' and adaption of the ideas,
like Chaos, which produced the
famous Mandelbrot set, to Optics
and theoretical physics. When he
applied catastrophe theory is to the
world of Quantum Mechanics
which rules the smallest aspects of
matter, Micheal Berry discovered
an effect which he named the 'Berry
Phase' and this will be the main
point of the discussion on Thursday.
Professor Kibble describes the
concept as 'a very intriguing idea'
with far reaching uses. A simple
way of visualising the principle is
found in a common bicycle wheel.
Imagine a wheel is held horizontally
and a mark put on any point along
its rim. If the wheel is then moved
the path of the motion and the
corresponding movement of the
mark on the rim of the wheel can
be related in what Professor Kibble
described as a very interesting
way'. Standing alone this example
would be of little interest to
Physicists, but the methods used can
be applied to the intricacies of
Quantum Mechanics, a source of
fascination and research funding to
all involved with science.
Enthusiastically recommending
the lecture Professor Kibble warned
that the venue may fill up quickly.
Indeed while we were talking he
received a phone call in which the
possibility of moving the event to
a larger site was discussed. For
those of you interested in going
tickets can be obtained from M r
Vandridge Ames room 333, level

will start at 5.30 pm on Thursday
in the Great Hall, Level 2 of the
Sherfield Building.
