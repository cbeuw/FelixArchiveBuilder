Flying High
Deadly doner in
On April 1st, seven courageous
climbing freaks found themselves in
a brave new world of hot rock when
the plane from Gatwick, bound for
Wales, found that it could not
penetrate the dense low pressure
region focused on the Snowdonia
National Park. Contingency plans
took us to Alicante on the Costa
Blanca, and from there, in 'Bullet'
the hire car, we sped to Calpe, Rob
at the wheel.
GCSE Spanish phrases ('I do not
eat school dinners because they are
horrible') and Jans humble Espanol
('Seven beers please') managed to
book us into a campsite for one
night.
Pilgrims to the volcanic rock
faces; disciples to Cliff Craggs,
author of 'Costa Blanca Climbs'
(our bible for the next ten days). We
first scaled the pendn de Ilfach by
the South face taking the 'Via
Valencianos' route. Five pitches
(820ft) and 6 hours later we'd made
it to the summut, five hours after
the tourists who'd walked 'via the
path'. Julian, determined to win the
most hideous shorts competition,
caught malaria while he cooked
bolognaise that evening and doubled
his success for the most bitten legs.
Bivvying on gravel for a second
night prompted us to hire cheap
accommodation for a week, found
with ease at this time of year.
Although the caretaker wouldn't
permit prassiMng attempts from the
balcony or the eyesore of the inside
of Rob's sleeping bag draped over
the verandah he made no comment
on the fact that Julian wore his
award-winning shorts in the pool
area, overlooked by other residents.
We climbed extensively, at gas
mark 5, shorter routes at Toix East
and West over the next few days
which had original names such as
"The Green Route' and 'Another
Green Route'. All the routes in the
Ihe Guide were well protected with
x>lts placed every couple of metres
',an essential part of a Spaniards
rack- is a 'Black 'n' Decker rock
drill) and the rock gave good
friction. The only risk which
presented itself was falling on one
of Rob's 'teatowel' extenders.
Sarah renewed her status as an aid
climber on one horrendous slab.
On a second multipitch route up
the Pendn de Ilfach by the N W
face, Martin came face to beak with
a nesting seagul, who, finding his
sunhat offensive, divebombed him.
We climbed in the Mascarat Gorge
the following day, despite creating
our own mountains of egg-fried rice
made interesting by the odd
molecule of meat, and the group
split the day after, one party
climbing at the Dalle D'Ola and the
other at Sella, an hours drive away
along hairpin bend roads.
One group of three spent a day
ascending the 1200ft Puig
Campana. Sunbaked and thirsty,
Andy delirious after expecting a
'relaxing day' (quote Rob) to
recover from Extreme climbing the
day before, we descended after ten
pitches by a trecherous route to
arrive (thanks only to the glow from
some luminous yellow Ron Hills)
at the pick-up (—a bar) at 9.30pm.
While some took a day off to buy
up the rock boot factory shop in
Alicante (and finding it shut
resorting to the golden beaches),
three others braved a 790ft, 7 pitch
route ('Via UPSA') up the South
side of the Barranco Del Mascarat.
Again, a trecherous descent route:
'Traverse the narrow ridge...' (a
knife edge)'.. .follow the terrace...'
(what terrace?) '...climb the 15ft
wall (Diff) onto the open hillside...'
(Open? NOT! Lots of scree and
scrub) '...Turn L and descend E
into a gully...' (Smooth rock at
45°!) '...then across the railway
line...' (Slide under passing train)
'.. .to eventually reach...' (drop 15ft
onto...) '...the road. Do not be
tempted to turn L too early as there
are cliffs below.' It seems Cliff
Craggs didn't make it.
Sella was the place to be. It
boasted a huge range of climbs for
all abilities, all bolted on a selection
of crags, free camping amongst the
almond groves and settlements of
long hair Spanish climbers, and no
dodgy descent routes. We spent the
end of the tour here. Martin claimed
titles for both the hardest lead and
the greatest lob (although Sarah's
was more dynamic) but failed
dismally at the ongoing shorts
contest despite wearing two pairs at
the same time. Ian gained, hands
down, the most patient belayer
award for staying awake (just) as
Rob remained on a microscopic
ledge for 1 'A hours (an
underestimation, no kidding!) as he
waited for the next iceage to erode
new holds.
Sarah Wingrove.
On the 27th March sixteen mad
fools voluntarily entered a Union
transit van and embarked upon a
two-day journey to the Isle of Skye,
which included a deadly doner
kebab in Dumbarton at the end of
the first day.
The wind picked up as we
approached Glen Bittle campsite
and as the gate closed behind us, the
rain started.
The first day saw an absurd
attempt to reach Waterstein Head in
force nine winds and cannonball
rain which unfortunately had to be
aborted.
On Tuesday an intrepid party set
out on a 17 mile walk in similar
conditions to the previous day's
efforts, taking in one Munro (a peak
over 3,000 ft or 914m in height) and
overcoming the terrors of the Bad
Step: a dodgy traverse of a steep
rock face with the Atlantic Ocean
beckoning below.
A second party attempted Bla
Bheinn (928m) but were beaten
back by the slighdy less than
favourable conditions.
After a brief stop in Portree,
where several members were seen
to consume large quantities of
doughnuts, we proceeded on
Wednesday to the Old Man of
Storr, which resulted in an
unwarrantedly vicious snowball
fight. It was at this point that one
of the authors endured an
uncomfortably high heart rate while
ascending a snow laden gully. This
discomfort was offset by a
remarkably favourable change in
the weather, with sunshine and blue
skies.
By the following morning two
suicidal maniacs had decided to
attempt an ascent of Sgurr a
Mhadaidh (918m) and Sgur a
Greadaidh (973m), finally being
stopped by sheet ice some 20m
short of the second summit.
Meanwhile, those who had

Circus
Balls, knives and people are flying
through the air. Clowns delight,
tumblers leap and all kinds of act
bewitch and enchant the eye. The
audience is enjoying some of the
best circus acts in the country,
brought together on the
unprepossessing stage inside a
decorated warehouse in darkest
Islington. This is a night out with
a difference. Cabaret night is the
'shop window' for Circus Space
and if you feel inspired by the
dashing young men (and women) on
the flying trapeze you can return
during the week to learn for
yourself. In the autumn of 1989 a
group of enthusiastic circus
performers set out to provide a site
in London where they could
practice and create new circus acts.
They found a suitable derelict
building and, undeterred by the
j evidence of twelve years occupation
| by pigeons, set about making it in
to a usable space for training. They
I approached Gillian Harwood of
United Workspaces, responsible for
the property, and she agreed to let
them use the building for a few
months until a tenant could be
.found. The recession removed any
realistic chance of this happening
and Circus Space began to develop.
Years later the pigeons are a distant
memory. The building has been
thoroughly renovated, including the
W&mm
installation of heating and toilets, all
the result of many hours of
volunteer labour. They pay a
princely rent as formal tenants and
enjoy the support of the London
Arts Board. The informal teaching
has become a well organised system
of regular classes and occasional
workshops for all levels of skill.
The aim is still fundamentally the
same: the development of good
circus in Britain. They offer quality
teaching, both to professional
performers and as a leisure activity
for enthusiastic amateurs. In
particular they are proud to be able
to provide aerial skills training. This
was one of the main reasons for
founding the Space, as it requires
specialised trapeze equipment
which is not available elsewhere.
Also they have a resource of expert
gymnastic skill. I frequently attend
one of the popular juggling classes,
where I practice along side the best
without feeling out of place. It is an
excellent way to push myself to
learn new tricks, in an environment
where I can get the help to master
them. It is also a fun way to meet
other jugglers and enjoy an evening
of something quite different. If you
are interested in Circus Space,
either to train there or to see one of
their cabaret shows you can pick up
a flyer in the Union Office with
more details. I recommend that you
at least go along and see what is
happening there if you have an
interest in circus arts. Note that
there are no animals there, Circus
Space is for human circus acts only.
Dunbarton
retained some sanity walked over
Macleod's tables: two flat-topped
peaks onthe North-West of the
island.
It should be noted that by this
point some 14 of the 16 members
of the party had contracted the
dreaded lurgy and were suitably
restrained in their activities. The
union van was also suffering from
several mechanical maladies.
Friday dawned bright and clear,
several hours after which a party
ascended Bruach na Frith (958m)
before descending to the Sligachan
Hotel for liquid refreshment.
The remainder of the party
ascended the ridge of Sgurr nan
Gobhar and Sgurr na Banachdich
(965m) which resulted in superb
views of the entire Cuillin ridge and
a 'fascinating' scramble along a
snowy ridge to the neighbouring
peak of Sgurr Dearg before a break-
neck descent of the scree slope
down to the camp-site.
Saturday dawned wet and windy
with increasing numbers of the
party incapacitated with the lurgy.
One party walked down Glen
Sligachan and over a col towards
Torrin, whilst the other party sat in
a cafe and, later, a pub (briefly)
before meeting the others and
returning to the campsite. The
prospect of a Tuna Mornay drove
the entire party to the pub in the
evening wherein suitable quantities
of alcohol and food were consumed
and this article was written.
Should you feel an affinity for
such acts of insanity, please contact
Ross Richards (Aero II) for details
of our forthcoming summer tour.
