Wings of Fame
I It is 1969, Caesar Valentin (Peter
I O'Toole) is a rich and famous actor.
Brainsmith (Colin Firth—A Month in
the Country, Tumbledown) is a poor
writer, whose only success is a biography
of Valentin, called Wings of Fame.
Valentin has taken this book and put his
own name to it. Smith, determined to be
recognised, finds all paths to the megastar
blocked by flunkies and sycophants. In
desperation and in public he assassinates
Valentin, while getting himself killed by a
falling camera light.
Is this the end of the film? You ask. No
way, this is the first ten minutes.
They are taken to a hotel which is their
surreal resting place. It is populated by
the celebrities, Albert Einstein and Ernest
Hemmingway are named and many
others are referred to, but disguised with
pseudonyms. Each one lives their own
vain, self-centred life, ignoring the fact
that their fame is fading on Earth. As the
memory of Earth disappears, so does the
quality of life in the hotel, until finally
they disappear into oblivion.
Valentin and Smith are now linked,
whenever Valentin is remembered so will
Smith be. They become antagonists,
fighting over each other and the beautiful
Bianca (Marie Trintignant), who has been
driven insane and refuses to believe she
is dead.
This is where the meat of the film is.
Valentin having to cope with his loss of
fame and treating his murderer with
respect. Drunken, conceited and self-
obsessed, Peter O'Toole plays as if the
part was written for him. Colin Firth
seems relaxed as the confused writer
trying to get revenge on someone he is
now bound to, as well as loving a woman
who doesn't know her own identity.
This could easily have become deep
and meaningful (meaningless), but the
Director, Otakar Votocek, keeps the tone
humourous but significant throughout. My
only fault with the film would be the
climax which is dark and violent, in
contrast to the rest of the film and seems
out of place. Overall a light and funny
satire on the importance celebrities place
on their own fame and how quickly it is
forgotten. Well worth going to see, if you
want something a little deeper than
Rambo but can't stomach three hours of
The Unbearable Lightness of Being.

The Jetsons
Okay! 60's revival cartoons from
. Hanna Barbera! Scooby Dool The
Flintstones! Great! Alas, The
Jetsons is not such a cartoon.
The Jetsons is a everyday story of
ordinary stereotypes in the far future.
Said plain folk comprise George (The
Radiant American Male), his wife who
doesn't get a name because she's only
there to be a good homemaker, his son
Painintheass and his daughter Judy, a
music mad teen who is voiced by Tiffany
of all people. Tiff also supplies a good
deal of the music (cough, cough) for this
feature so I need not elaborate on this
point. Suffice it to say that the cries of
warthogs fall more gently on my ears.
So what's it about ?
NOTHING.
In an effort to keep abreast of
sociological change, Mrs. Jetson is still
chained to the kitchen sink, Judy shops at
the mall and falls for any sufficiently
hunky dickhead in range, the kid is
irritatingly cute and bounces around with
the aid of several diabolically fluffy pals.
Sure, it's only a cartoon but isn't it time
kids got decent characters to go with
their moral homilies ?
Bolted onto this sad assemblage of
Dramatic Personae is a scripMhat throws
in an ecological theme (a concession to
the real world) which feels rather like the
cautionary bit at the end of Inspector
Gadget.
The gags (according to the press
release) are deliberately modelled after
those of the original series, which by
definition mean they're very dated. A lot
of rubbish puns and a lot of violent
metallic collisions. An appalling sequence
of swirling colours and tacky backdrops
as Tiff sings about prepubescent love.
The cast (apart from the deplorable
Tiffany) carry off their parts well, for the
most part. The blame for this film must
lie with the scriptwriters, who have
inflated half an hour's idea into two
hours. Roll on the Scooby Doo epic.
For small children. Small and simple-
minded children.
