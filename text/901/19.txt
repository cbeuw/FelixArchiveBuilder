1. Transport
Insurance questionnaires should be
returned by noon on May 1st. Any
questionnaires returned after this day
may require up to seven days clearance
before drivers are insured to drive.
2. Catering
I have been taking quite an interest in
College catering having recently met
Simon Westerman, Rob Northey's
successor. There have been a number of
developments including:
-Sandwiches that look nice but aren't as
good as those available in the Union
Bookstore or Lounge Bar.
-A drop in the price of Belushi's pizzas
but no raise in the standards.
-Very cheap breakfasts that aren't a touch
on Frank and Rosa's in Bute Street.
Certainly, there have been a number of
significant changes, some for the better.
However, for quality and value the Union
wins hands down.
3. Market Research
This takes place on Tuesday. 1,500
questionnaires will be given out at a
number of distribution points throughout
College. Volunteers are required to hand
out forms—see the box ad.
4. Accommodation
Montpelier Hall is off the market for two
years, until the property market picks up
again. The intention is to sub-let out to a
third party. This will result in a loss to
the bedstock of 80 beds.
Rent sfor next year have yet to be
discussed with me. Expect an
announcement in FELIX of any
developments.

1. Finance
Union Finance Committee has debated
the issue of payment of VAT on
membership to Union clubs and societies.
A recent communication from the
Customs and Excise indicates that this
payment may be back-dated to the
session 1987-88.
2. Retail
A range of pre-packed sandwiches have
been introduced to the Union's Lounge
Bar and the Bookstore.
In February, the first complete month
for which accounts are available after the
refurbishment, product line changes and
tightening-up of operational procedures,
the Catering outlet broke-even for the
first time ever.
It is too late in the year for it to break-
even for the whole year's operation, but
it is clear that a solid base has been
established for the future of this service.
3. Security
Rape alarms in the Union's ladies toilets
and changing rooms—to date, no
department (Safety, Security or Estates)
will accept responsibility for the
installation of this necessary alarm
system. Certain areas are alarmed, but
other vital ones are not. Latest word is
that nothing will happen until a new
Chief Security Officer has arrived and
settled in—unlikely to be until during the
summer vacation.
4. Mascotry
A lot of activity has resulted in C&GU
losing their mascots to RCSU, and RCSU
successfully pinched University College's
and Queen Mary and Westfield College's
mascots. Kings College retrieved bits of
their mascot, which have been behind the
Union Bar for some time.
M A R K E T R E S E A R C H
Students required to hand out questionnaires
on Tuesday morning.
Approximately £10 for three hours work. A p p l y to Michelle
in the U n i o n Office or on ext 3500.
