Editorial
Goodluck to one and all who are in the
land of exams. This issue is brought to
you without the help of our beloved
editor as he is one of the victims
mentioned above. Next week were sure
he will return with avengence.
Censorship
The world is full of it. It's one of those
things that everyone experiences at some
time in their lives, but more often it is an
ever present burden on the backs of the
unconventional. Those people who dare
to defy convention and go it alone
outside of society.
These people do not try and enforce
their beliefs or acts on an unwilling public
like many groups in our world. They
persue their aims in life and offer the
products of their labours. At this point
someone turns around and starts acting
all saintly and denounces their work as
offensive or blasphemous.
On the other hand, censorship can take
the form of the restriction of information
flow. Normally by a government or other

have to bear. It restricts our freedom to

away with murder. Sometimes quite
literally.
In any situation, it is something that
must be opposed and fought against. In
this issue you will find the details to
possibly the greatest event to be staged
at Imperial. An impressive line of guest
speakers ranging from authors and
journalists to scientists and film makers.
An array of literature and two banned
films; 'Visions of Ecstacy' and 'Dick'. And
to follow up, The Party Against
Censorship, featuring two bands and a
fantastic caberet act from the club
Madame JoJo's.
Michael Newman, the organiser, has put
an incredible amount of energy into the
event and we hope that this will be
rewarded by your support. You probably
won't see anything like it for a long time.
News Staff Needed.
Work off that exam tension
by quizzing the Union and
College about whats really
going on!
