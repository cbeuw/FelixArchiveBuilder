A Fond Farewell
From Aunty Jen
revised upwards again by the University
Court. Furthermore, there is no change in
managerial accountability. The present
ULCAS advisers are responsible
administratively to me; the general thrust of
careers service policy is determiend in
collaboration with the Careers Advisers
Committee. This will not change in the
future. Nor will our involvement in
AGCAS; in fact our links are likely to be
stronger.
The University of London is currently
considering how it provides and funds all its
federal services. Similarly the College is
also considering what it wants from federal
services and how much it is prepared to pay
for them. The careers service is simply part
of this overall discussion. In respect of the
careers service the plan is to provide for
more careers advisers and for more support
staff at less cost than we would have to pay
the University for the existing arrangement.
It is our intention to provide an even better
service than we have enjoyed in the past.
Your editorial really is a load of nonsense.
Yours sincerely,
P E Mee.

Dear Andy,
I am writing to express my sincere
thanks to all those people who helped
make my time at Imperial College so
enjoyable.
-to the permanent staff of the Union for
their help over the years, with special
mention to Pat Baker and Ken Weale for
their unfailing support through thick and
thin.
-to all the sabbaticals for making each
year so very different and so very
interesting.
-to the academic and administrative
staff of the College who give up their free
time to act as Senior Treasurers for the
many clubs and societies.
-to all the staff in every section of
College who helped smooth the way—if I
listed them all it would take up a whole

edition of FELIX.
-to the vast number of students who
helped just because I asked—and without
whom the Union would not function.
-to the committee who organised my
farewell 'do'—I hope they enjoyed it as
much as I did.
Andy my grateful thanks for all the
gifts showered on me—what with the
gardening encyclopedia, the Harrods
hamper and the cases of sherry and
champagne—if I'm not the most well-
informed and well-fed gardener in Ealing,
I'm certainly the most inebriated.
It was a marvellous 17 years and I wish
the Union every good fortune for the
future.
Sincerely,
Jen.
