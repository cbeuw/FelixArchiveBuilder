ULU Day Of Action
The University of London Union
has called a day of action for
Tuesday the 27th of January, as a
protest against the proposed 50%
cut in funding. ULU President Jane
Cannon said that she hoped that
there would be University-wide
support in various forms, such as
work-ins, token occupations, or
even a "50% cuts" fancy dress party.
The day of action is to be
Welfare
Handbook
A centrally produced welfare
handbook should be ready for next
year's freshers, according to U L U
VP Nick Wilkins. The handbook
will be produced in association with
the NUS, with possible funding
from ILEA. Many smaller colleges,
and some of those outside London,
are unable to produce their own
handbooks. A questionnaire is
being sent to colleges who produce a
handbook to see if they would be
willing to fund a centrally produced
one.
Ex-ICU Welfare Officer Peter
Wilson, who suggested the idea to
last year's U L U sabbaticals, said
that it is a shame that it takes so long
for ULU to act and that he would be
glad to see the handbook when it
finally arrives.
Print
Shop
A new print shop has opened in the
U L U building, opposite the
National Westminster bank. "Sir
Speedy" offer a wide range of
printing and finishing services. Of
special interest to students are the
text composition and binding
services.
High speed photocopying is
available for 6 pence per A4 copy,
with stapling and collating included.
This will replace the two coin-
operated machines currently in the
ULU foyer. A 24 hour turnaround is
provided for printing jobs, using
equipment at other Sir Speedy sites
throughout L o n d o n . Peter
Newsham, ULU Deputy Adminis-
trator, said "We see this as a major
extension of the services that we can
offer our membership."
For information about the full
range of services, call in to U L U in
Malet Street, and talk to Kathy
Parker, the manageress.
discussed at a meeting of the ICU
External Affairs Committee on
Monday, when a decision will be
made on the proposal of an
emergency motion for Thursday's
UGM. ICU President Christine
Taig said that she will consult the
College trade unions if the motion is
proposed and accepted, though it is
not clear what form any action at IC
will take.
