Alan "Ludovic Kennedy" Rose is
regretting his choosiness at who his
neighbours are. After being
informed that Adrian "Jelly"
Johnson was to be moving into the
room directly above his in Old Beit,
Alan was concerned enough to ask
accommodation supremo Lesley
Gillingham to have Jelly put into
another room, preferably in a
completely different Hall. It's not
that they don't get on, just that
Ludovic fears Jelly may develop
some strange nocturnal habits in
addition to his legendary snoring,
such as stomping loudly on the floor
and playing The Residents at three
in the morning. However, Lesley
could only find one other spare
room, which unfortunately for
Ludovic was the one next door.
Sherfield simpleton Michael
Arthur is never afraid of being in the
firing line. At College Secretary
John Smith's Twelfth Night party
earlier this week, Michael was
observed in intense discussion with
ICU Hon Sec "Gutman" Colley
about plans for the development of
the Union building. Gutman. whose
father used to work in a garage, was
holding forth on his recently
hatched "Beit astrodome" scheme;
an architectural project dreamt up
in a session of the all-powerful
Union Building Working party. The
first draft of plans from the Dave
Colley Development Corporation
includes an inner ring of perspex
screens inside the quad, enclosing 1
volleyball court, 2 badminton
courts and one indoor football
pitch. The quad would be
completely covered.
Michael was very enthusiastic
about the feasibility of such a
scheme. "I can see no objection to
that idea" he replied, and went on to
"stake his reputation on it."
Michael is also very keen to see his
beloved Queens Tower put to better
use, and was happy with Gutman's
suggestion that IC Caving club be
allowed to use the interior of the
Tower to practice descending into a
deep shaft.
Nothing personal, Michael, but...

Hall redevelopment.
