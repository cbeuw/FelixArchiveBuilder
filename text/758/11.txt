Clubs. FELIX, Friday January 9th 1987 12
B a l l o o n C l u b
On the first weekend in January the
annual 'ICICLE Hot-Air Balloon
Meet' is held near Newbury. Being
one of the largest of such meetings in
Britain (over one hundred
balloons), it is often attended by the
College Balloon Club. This year
being no exception, ten of us met in
drizzly London on Friday, loaded
up the balloon and set off in the van,
keeping our fingers crossed that the
weather would improve over the
weekend. Sleeping arrangements
were simple; we crashed out at
Tony's (a local pilot and good friend
of the club).
Saturday morning and we were
greeted by perfect weather—
sunshine, blue sky and little wind.
We arrived at the take-off field to
find that the spectators had arrived
early, creating quite a traffic
jam—this was quickly avoided by
taking a one-way the wrong way! By
9 o'clock about twenty balloons,
including ours, were inflated and
ready to go. Richard and Markus
(trainee pilot) flew first with Mike
(pilot), the rest of us chasing the
balloon in the van (the infamous
retrieve). After a safe landing, we
went to have breakfast at lunch-time
(not uncommon to balloonists) and
by 2 o'clock we were ready for
another flight. This time, Wayne
and Jan (me!) flew, with Mike
piloting again. To fly at 3,000 feet
and watch the world just float by is
an experience difficult to
describe—exhilarating is to put it
mildly.
Minor mishaps included —
Mike's bobble hat, Eddie's brain
(lack of), Markus's long arms,
Wayne asking directions and Claire
finding somebody in the bath. Apart
from these, the weekend was a great
success and seeing over one hundred
balloons take-off together was an
absolutely breathtaking sight.
To see photos from this trip, or to
find out more about ballooning,
come along to one of our regular
Thursday meetings (Southside at
1.00pm)—all welcome!
Trip To Paris
30 students from Imperial College
are to visit Paris as guests of students
at the Ecole Superieure de Physique
et Chemie Industrielles de la Ville de
Paris on the weekend of January
29th—February 1st. In return, 30
French students will visit London
on the weekend of 20-23 March.
This exchange will involve
visiting the French college and a
French company, lots of socialising,
culture and sport. It is an excellent
opportunity to get to know how
French students live, and to try to
get addresses of where you can stay
in France.
The cost of the travel is about £35,
the accommodation will be free
(French students' flats) and
entertainments will be extra. The
Old Centralians have given us £300
towards the trip, other donations
may follow.
The students who go to Paris will
provide accommodation and help to
entertain the French students when
they visit London.
If you are interested in a cheap
weekend in Paris to unwind in the
middle of this term, then this is for
you. Contact Richard Murray,
Chem Eng letter racks by January
13th.
Science
Fiction
In our continuing efforts to bring
you science-fictional edification and
delectation from all possible
sources, and our ongoing quest to
render our articles increasingly
obscure and erudite (eh?-Ed), I bring
you glad tidings from the hallowed
halls of ICSF. To celebrate the start
of a new year and in some way
signify our headlong rush to the
millenium, we shall present two
auspicious events in the
forthcoming week.
Firstly, on Friday January 9th in
the Union Building from 7.30 (check
posters for details) we shall be
showing the complete Hitch-Hikers
Guide to the Galaxy television
series, and then on Tuesday 13th
January at 7.30pm in ME220, we
shall show the celebrated
Videodrome to the unsuspecting
audience. Directed by Dave
Cronenberg, whose latest film, The
Flag, has received enormous praise
from SF and mainstream critics
alike. Videodrome stars Debbie
Harry and shows what a world
d o m i n a t e d by cable T V
corporations might be like. Again
check posters for details. See you
there.
