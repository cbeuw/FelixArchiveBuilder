Linstead Thefts
There were several burglaries in
Linstead Hall on Saturday 13th
December 1986. As with the
previous thefts from Linstead Hall,
it was mainly photograhic and and
music equipment that was taken.
There were no signs of forcible entry
and the rooms had been locked at
the time. The items were stolen
betwen 4pm and 9pm when many
students were moving out of Hall
for the Christmas vacation. The
burglars took two empty suitcases, a
camera, a walkman and hi-fi
equipment valued at £1,100.
It is thought that the same master
key was used to gain entry as in
previous burglaries from Linstead
Hall. This master key went missing
over a year ago during the Summer
period. College Security is in the
process of ordering new locks for
the Hall.

Fellow
Smith
John Smith, the College Secretary,
has been made a Fellow of
University College, London. The
inauguration will take place at the
Annual Fellows Dinner in May.
Mr. Smith was a student at the
college, graduating in 1949.
Increased Funding
In Polytechnics
Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
announced the allocations to
polytechnics and local authority
colleges for 1987-88 in the House of
Commons on 19 December 1986.
The amount has been increased by
nearly 8.5% over 1986-87, to
£716.5m. This means that there will
be 3000 more places at polytechnics
and colleges for the coming
academic year. The National
Advisory Body for Public Sector
H i g h e r E d u c a t i o n ( N A B )
recommended the closure of town
and country planning under-
graduate colleges from 1987-88.
However, M r . Baker has
provisionally decided that the
courses at Leeds and Coventry
Polytechnics, and Essex Institute of
Higher Education, should close
from 1988-89. He has also increased
the number of places for fine arts at
certain institutes, to moderate the
overall reduction of fine arts
numbers recommended by the
NAB.
The capital allocations to the
local authorities in England for
1987-88 are to be £297 million.
Overall, there is an estimated £2.8
billion in receipts available to
authorities in 1987-88. At the same
time, the Government has made
£200 million available for a new
scheme for the in-service training of
teachers and others employed in the
education sector.
'New'
Warden
A new warden has been appointed
for Falmouth/Keogh Hall in
Southside. Professor New, head of
the Laser Optics Group in the
Physics department, was given the
job towards the end of last term, and
is expected to move in during the
next few weeks.
He told FELIX that he saw his
role as a senior member of the
College within the Hall; to act as
somebody residents could talk to if
they had problems, to become
involved in the social life, and to
generally improve the quality of life
for the residents, something, he
added, that was needed in any Hall.
