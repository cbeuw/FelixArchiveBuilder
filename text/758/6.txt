Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday January 9th 1987 6
All the
Presidents Men?
or
Christine's bit
for FELIX
Well it seems that term's started
again, right in the middle of the
post-festive recovery period. What
with that and the Access bill, this
isn't exactly my favourite time of the
year....I hope you had a good
holiday too. Roll on spring....
Meanwhile, there's plenty going
on. The Union is running two major
campaigns at the moment, one on
security consciousness, the other on
health matters. Please cooperate in
these campaigns where possible, it's
the only way anything good will
come of them. Any comments/
criticisms about the way they've
been organised will be welcome.
On the social front, there will be
free live music and disco's every
Saturday evening for the next few
weeks, all in the Union Lounge bar.
Tomorrow we're celebrating the bar
'birthday', with Stagefright and a
rock disco till midnight, plus special
offers and guest beer Brakspear's
special at 84p.
The Accommodation Office
The reorganisation of the Student
Services Office—now the
"Accommodation Office"—is,
hopefully, the first step in a major
revision of the College welfare
services, for which the Union has
been pressing for months. I wish
Lesley Gillingham the best of luck in
her new role—and hope that
College will continue to develop a
service which is both efficient and
'user-friendly'.
UGM
The first U G M of term is next
Thursday at 1.00pm in the Great
Hall. Amongst other things, there'll
be some discussion about the future
of the Junior Common Room; and
an election for External Affairs
Officer. Emergency motions for the
U G M should be submitted to the
Union Office by Tuesday.
You don't have to be crazy, but...
Now is the time of year when
students' thoughts turn to happy
things like full-time employment....
others start thinking about
becoming Union Sabbaticals. If you
fall into the latter catagory, my only
advice is to talk to the present holder
of the post—even if you think we're
doing a rotten job, we might be able
to tell you something useful.

Dave Writes
The Hon See's article is once again
going to be on the whole boring to
most, but to a few, very interesting
indeed.
Insurance
Would the following like to come
and see me:
C Keener, R Molloy, J Rhodes,
C Langford. GW Hall, N Curry, C
Hajek, T Koshinen, T Meliar-
Smith, L McCauley, N McDonald,
G Scott, T Shaw, J Thalanese, J
Van der Broek, C Wye.
This doesn't mean all rush to me,
but try and make it quite quickly to
see me so as I can get things moving,
or resolve problems.
Elections
Due to the resignation of the
previous holder of the post, there is
now a vacancy for a Union External
Affairs Officer. This job is
concerned with keeping Imperial
College Students aware of events in
the big wide world outside, and
ensuring that students play their role
in producing a better town, country
or world. This job would range from
the proposed cuts of 50% in the
University of London Union to, say,
the occupation of Afganistan.
The papers have been up since
Monday night in the main entrance
to the Union building. More
information on this job can be
obtained from the sabbaticals. This
post is for the rest of this academic
year.
The time is almost upon us for the
Annual Election of next year's
Union officers:

Answers
Apologies to those of you who tried
the crossnumber only to find there
was a clue missing. Not only that,
but one of the clues given was
wrong-it just seems I'm cursed
when it comes to crossnumbers!
The incorrect clue and the missing
clue were both in the Other clues
section:
(5.14.23) Sum of digits is same as
sum of digits of (10,11,12).
(4.14.24) Two digits the same.
If you made it this far, it
shouldn't be too difficult to finish
the problem, so I'll extend the
deadline to next Wednesday, the
14th, 1.00pm as usual. Don't forget
the £5 prize is still up for grabs.
The crossword prize goes to Ken
Holroyd, Mech Eng 3. Well done.
Please collect your £5 after 1.00pm
Monday. Congratulations also to
Simon Hall and Robert Shiels who
entered correct solutions but didn't
win the prize. •
Carpet Caper
The diagrams show the cut, and
how the carpets fit together. This is
the only solution I know of, if any
of you found another please let me
know!
Next Number
Each number in the series was
the number 15 written in a different
base, starting at base 15 and ending
at base 2, so the next number in the
series is 15 written in base 1. It's
arguable as to how this should be
done, so I'll leave that for you to
think about!

This week's puzzle-Pyramid
problems
Shown below are two pyramids,
one with a square base and one
with a triangular base (a
tetrahedron). All the sides of both
pyramids are equal in length.
Without using trigonometry,
calculus or other complicated
algebra, find the ratio of their
volumes (ie I want a simple
argument). Please provide your
explanation. Answers etc, by
1.00pm Wednesday 14th for the £5
prize, please.
