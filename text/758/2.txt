University
Sector Should
Go Alone
Dear FEUX.
As an undergradute at IC I voted
for the reaffiliation to NUS in the
last referendum. However my
experiences with N U S as a
postgraduate at Sussex University
(including being a delegate to the
annual conference and a member of
the local NUS area council), leave
me with some sympathies for
Alastair Seymour's views (FELIX
757).
One point he missed is that many
of NUS's members are not from
universities, but from polytechnics,
further education colleges and even
sixth form colleges. The level of
student involvement in union affairs
is much less at these institutions,
thus they form an easy way for
unrepresentative groups to infiltrate
the NUS. This was quite obvious in
the conference I attended where the
far left was much more dominent at
full sessions than at the seperate
university sessions. In my local area,
apathy, the naivety of many young
students, and the difficulty of
organising over a dozen or so small
Colleges, meant that the full-time
post of area organiser was used by a
member of the militant tendancy to
pursue his own political ambitions.
Even at the university, NUS
delegation elections were treated
merely as political beauty contests.
Most candidates used them just to
promote their own views which had
little to do with NUS or to make a
name for themselves before internal
sabbatical elections. N U S
conference itself was largely a
slanging match between the two
competing groups in the Labour
party. Since delegations are forced
to vote for Union Policy (ie anything
passed at a U G M perhaps by 51 % to
even if, as in my case, they
were elected on a platform of
opposition to it, NUS's claim to be
democratic because delegates are
elected on a cross-campus
proportional representation ballot
looks a little hollow.
However, I feel there is still a
place for a national student
organisation, and rather than ignore
NUS, ICU should be making
positive criticisms. Firstly
attempting to bring all students
together in a single union does not
work. It would be better to have a
seperate university students
organisation which could decide
whether or not to cooperate with
other sectors. Secondly, the
unwieldy bureaucratic structure
should be completely broken down.!
The emphasis should be on the
national organisation providing ,
information and resources for its
members, rather than on
campaigning and 'making policy'
for itself. Thirdly, a complete review
of all democratic procedures should
be made, with a particular emphasis
on ensuring that all members have a '
fair chance and not just those with
the backing of well-organised but
unrepresented political groups.
Yours Sincerely,
Matthew Huntbach,
Life Member, ICU.
Council
Report
Slated
Dear Dave,
With reference to the article titled
"Stick of Rock" in the FELIX
Christmas issue (FELIX 757), I
would like to correct the author of
the said article on several
misrepresentations of fact which
were made. Most of the inaccuracies
centre about Mr Ian Howgate and
his behaviour at the IC Union
Council meeting of Monday
December 8; as FELIX articles do
not carry 'by-lines' I do not know
who wrote the article, but I sincerely
hope that these errors were not
included simply because the author
happens to dislike Mr Howgate.
Mr Howgate was not upset by the
amount of mundane business on the
agenda. All Council members, Mr
Howgate included, realise that
Council must deal with a certain
amount of mundane matters if the
Union is to function properly. What
he did object to, however (and in
this he has my full support), was the
fact that some of the minutes to be
considered and approved by
Council had only been available to
Council members at the start of the
meeting. Normal Council policy is
to circulate these minutes at least a
week in advance so that they can be
studied carefully, and Council
members can prepare an effective
and well thought-out case should
any matters arise from those
minutes. With the minutes being
distributed only at the start of the
meeting, it was impossible to study
them properly in order to approve
them, and it was this that Mr
Howgate and other Council
members objected to.
Secondly, Mr Howgate did not
object to Mr Fish's report on the
grounds of his absence. Mr
Howgate correctly pointed out that
there was little point in discussing
Mr Fish's report if Mr Fish was not
there to answer questions on it.
Another Council member put
forward the ridiculous idea of
putting those questions to Mr Chris
Martin, simply because he too was a
PG and happened to be at the
meeting.'Mr Martin naturally could
not answer the questions, so Mr
Howgate suggested deferring
consideration of Mr Fish's report
until such time as Mr Fish was
present. It was at this point that the
ICU Deputy President told Mr
Howgate not to be so "babyish";
this was, in my view, not a very
constructive or substantiated
accusation.
Mr Howgate suggested that since
the Academic Affairs Officer was
absent, his report too should be
deferred for later consideration; it is
a giant leap from the truth to say
that "Mr Howgate also proposed
that all of the minutes of Council
Committees such as Internal
Services and Academic Affairs be
rejected as well", as stated in the
aforementioned article.
Lastly, I would like to say that at
no time did Mr Howgate blame
Union publicity for "the failing of
most events this year including
Guilds Carnival and Rag Carnival".
This is a ludicrous suggestion
because:
i) Most events this year have not
failed.
ii) City and Guilds College Union
is responsible for the Guilds
Carnival publicity.
iii) There has been no such thing
called Rag Carnival.
What Mr Howgate did suggest
was that the running of IC Union
Publicity could possibly be
improved by making more use of
Soc. Reps.
I hope this sets the record straight
as to what happened at the last
Council Meeting.
Yours sincerely,
Alastair J Seymour,

Shallow
Policy Of
Electioneers
Dear Dave,
Once again it is the time of the
academic year when potential
Union Sabbatical candidates start
to corner innocent bystanders and
bore them to death with tales of
Southside Security and College
policy. This is to be expected. What
is not to be expected is personal
attacks on other students, who, out
of goodwill, put a lot of time and
effort into the smooth running of
the Union.
I refer, of course, to Ian
Howgate's attack on Chas Jackson,
the Union's publicity officer. Chas
spends a lot of time making and
distributing the posters you see
around College advertising events in
the Union Bar/Lounge and in the
Union Building. Despite all his hard
work, Chas could not escape the
ruthlessly efficient Howgate election
campaign. At ICU Council at the
end of last term, he blamed the poor
turn out to Union events on bad
publicity, and, suprise suprise,
suggested setting up a committee to
look after this side of things. I can
see it now—"Vote Howgate for
President—the man who sets up
committees". Pass the bucket.
It is sad that the dog-eat-dog style
of electioneering seems to have
permeated down to ICU. Let us
hope those who vote in the next
sabbatical elections can see through
this shallow policy.
Yours in selfpublicity,
Pete Wilson,
DoC III.
FELIX News
Misleading
Dear Dave,
I must strongly object to an article
that appeared in FELIX 757 (page
5) on the grounds that it was neither
objective nor genuine news. I was
present with Mr Howgate at the
meeting concerned as a deputy from
the AAO, Dave Lowrie, and apart
from myself, only one other
independent observer was present
who was not a FELIX journalist.
Therefore, the article must have
been written by a member of the
Union, hardly objective journalism
as the vindictive tone of the article
went on to prove. The article was
more of a personal opinion, and as
such should have appeared in the
letters section, and not in the news
section, and it should have been
signed. For these reasons the article
was rendered misleading to the full.
May I explain further. Firstly, the
article said that "Mr Howgate
objected to Mr Fish's report on the
grounds of his absence". This is
totally misleading, and deliberately
so. Secondly, Mr Howgate did say
that he was "upset the the paper for
Council members were circulated
late", but he did not "criticise Union
publicity as being responsible for the
failing of most events this year,
including Guilds Carnival and Rag
Carnival". Most people, M r
Howgate included, know that
several factors account for the
failure of events and so it would be a
ridiculous statement to make. The
author of the article very cleverly
runs the two previous auotes
together, attempting to lerid a
certain absurdity to the former of
