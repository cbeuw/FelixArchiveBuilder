the two. Creative journalism,
perhaps! Misleading and totally
subjective, yes. The very fact that an
article entitled 'Stick of Rock',
suposedly reporting on an ICU
meeting concerns itself almost
entirely with one man (Mr
Howgate), who was present for less
than half the meeting, proves my
point for me.
Perhaps Mr Bob Kinghorn, head
of safety in the Geology department
should have the last word on the
matter. In an article entitled
'Slinging The Shit' (page 4), Mr
Kinghorn retracted what he had
said because he did not "trust
FELIX to quote him accurately".
Sincerly Yours,
Thomas Daniel Brandon.
Slanderous
Material
Dear Dave,
I feel it is outrageous to allow
someone deeply involved in a piece
of news to write the news article on
that event. If Mark Cottle wishes to
write slanderous material about me,
I suggest he put it as a letter or
opinion article with his name at the
bottom of it and come out of hiding
from behind the skirt of FELIX.
Yours,
Ian Howgate.
Dear FEUX,
Several people have commented
to me in emotional terms upon the
article in the Christmas FELIX
about Ian Howgate's behaviour at
IC Council. I feel, in the light of the
tirade being planned against me by
the Howgate publicity machine,
that I must defend myself.
Normally it would be up to the
editor to defend the news content of
FELIX, but as Mr. Howgate and
friends appear to be mounting a
personal campaign against me, I feel
compelled to stand up for myself.
Firstly, I would like to say that I
stand by what I wrote as a
representation of what went on; the
only bits of the article I am not
responsible for are the headline and
a couple of small editorial cuts
which may change details but do not
affect the gist of the item. I do not
pretend to understand Ian
Howgate, and I cannot say what the
real reasons for his actions are.
What I did was write what he
appeared to say and do. He certainly
made a scathing attack on Union
publicity which showed little
understanding of the problems
involved and later, when I
challenged him, took back some of
his attacks on specific people.
On the matter of Mr. Howgate's
objections to reports and minutes, it
was very difficult to determine
exactly what his arguments were, as
he seemed to have a new one every
time he opened his mouth. I would
accept that it is bad that all the bits
of paper were not circulated in
advance, and it is unfortunate that
every single member of Council was
not present to be quizzed on their
activities. But honestly, this is the
real world; at least if someone takes
the trouble to write about what they
have been doing, Council should
have the decency to acknowledge it.
It seemed to me that Ian was arguing
that the meeting should be simpler
and more relevant, whilst at the
same time arguing that everything
should be referred back and creating
a lot of pointless wrangling.
If Ian had really wanted to object,
he could have asked for a vote; he
didn't. My suspicion is that Ian
stormed out because he knew that
he was not going to get his own way.
Furthermore, I believe his actions
have all been largely in the cause of
promoting Ian Howgate.
I first encountered Ian in
Southside last year, when he was in
conflict with Carl Burgess, and on
this occasion I strongly supported
him. The difference between then
and now is that last year's Executive
were entirely incompetent, while
this year's are trying to pick up the
pieces. At the very least I would
accuse Ian of being over-ambitious
and naive in his attempts to become
involved in every aspect of the
Union. I support Mr. Howgate's gut
feelings, but I think the way that he
goes about some of his campaigns is
incompetent, especially his dealing
with committees where he faces
opposition.
This, then, is my view of Ian
Howgate in order to clear up the
position of my bias. As for other
people's bias and objectivity, I
would suggest that every one of us is
biased in his own views. I do not
believe that any of us is an objective
observer; take heed Howgate
lackeys.
I must defend FELIX in the
current circumstances. This last
term has seen Dave under extreme
pressure while setting up the new
office, especially as the contractors
finished late. FELIX news requires
students to write it. These are by
definition involved to some extent in
what they are reporting. I wrote the
Council report at short notice, as
someone who was present, and
several other Council members
backed up the gist of what I wrote
when I discussed it with them. Dave
Jones took our collective word. The
single quote that I used was entirely
authentic.
If Ian Howgate and friends wish
to find convenient targets for their
self-publicity campaigns, they
should look elsewhere. For myself, I
am entirely disillusioned with
student politics and am no longer a
Council member. I will thus not
have to suffer any more endless
committees full of self publicists. We
live in a dreamworld here, and the
sooner I leave it, the happier I will
be.

Student Services
Reshuffle
The Student Services Office in
Princes Gardens existed for a
relatively short period, and in that
time neither of the men who have run
the service have been particularly
popular. There has always been a
conflict of interests between the
organisation of College accom-
modation and the welfare service. As
Student Services Officer Michael
Arthur, now College Assistant
Secretary, put a lot of work into the
accommodation side, but was heavily
criticised for being offhand to
students when they used the office.
Don Ferguson did not approach his
job as dilligently, and there has been a
lack of harmony between Student
Services stafffor some months. It is a
sensible move to pass the resonsibility
for invoicing and collecting rents to
the Finance Section, but as yet the
welfare service is without a
permanent home. I would suggest
that the welfare section be transferred
to the Health Centre, and perhaps
amalgamated with the Student
Counsellor's office. I wish Lesley
Gillingham the best of luck with her
new job, but she may struggle to keep
up her work on welfare; the situation
needs to be resolved swiftly. College
administration did not take the
opportunity to re-structure Student
Services when Don Ferguson took
over; this time there must be a little
more foresight.
Hold The Front
Page
As I promised to try and expand the
content of FELIX in the last issue
before Christmas, it is a little
disappointing to start the spring
term with such a light issue. There
are still afew production difficulties
but, with luck, they should be
resolved within the next two weeks
once the new typesetter is fully
installed.
There will be meeting in the
FELIX office today at 12.30pm for
anyone who would like to join the
FELIX staff this term; I appreciate
that many students will already be
involved with other clubs and
societies, but there is no need to
make a heavy committment. I will be
making particular efforts to ensure
that the production runs to schedule
this term, and so we should be
collating at a civilised hour. If
anyone is not doing anything next
Thursday at 9.00pm, you know
where to go.
