The Scorsese A l b u m
The National Film Theatre has
compiled a season of films detailing
the career of one of America's
foremost directors, Martin Scorsese.
It runs all through January and
includes thirty-one films, the eleven
that he has directed, many others
that he has worked on and some
that Scorsese requested to have
included as, although he was not
involved in their making, they had a
great influence on him. The variety
of subjects on show is huge, from
musicals to documentaries, hard
biting comedy, biography and
westerns.
Scorsese is an American of Italian
descent who grew up in the violence
of the New York ghettos. One of his
earliest successes, Mean Streets, was
largely based on his boyhood and
traces the lives of Hoodlums
desperate to climb up the ladder of
crime to Godfather status. It was a
small-budget, independently made
film, in a realistic style that truly
broke new ground for American
cinema in 1973. Scorsese was lucky
to find an actor with whom he could
collaborate successfully at this early
stage, Robert de Niro. De Niro is the
ultimate method actor, he does not
imitate the character he is
portraying but becomes him, not
only on the film set but in everyday
life. Their next film together, Taxi
Driver, is the story of a psychopathic
killer, obsessed with a young girl,
who believes that it is his mission to
clean up the streets of New York.
The film has been criticised for its
excessive violence, but it has now
reached cult status, and is certainly a
remarkable attempt to look into the"
mind of a mad-man who sees
himself as being above society.
New York, New York was a
complete change for both director
and actor. It is a pastiche of the great
40's musicals where De Niro is a
stubborn, self-centred musician
who marries singer Liza Minnelli.
He is unable to understand that his
wife wants to make decisions about
her own life and so walks out of their
stormy relationship. He then cannot
come to terms with why his ex-wife
becomes a star but in amongst the
rows and hurt there are some
brilliant jazz numbers and Minelli
singing the original version of "New
York, New York", which was
written for her anyway, and when
you hear it you can understand why!
Raging Bull was made three years
later. It is biography of ex-world
boxing champion Jake La Motta.
De Niro trained for months so that
he could do the fight sequences, by
the end he was reckoned to be one of
the best Middleweights in America
and could easily have gone
professional. However, he then put
on 561bs to play the boxer as he
degenerated after losing his title. It is
more about the boxer as a person
than the sport, and was shot in black
and white to add to the intensity. It
was deservedly heaped with awards.
King of Comedy is, again, about
the degeneration of a man as he tries
to find success. De Niro plays a
terrible stand-up comedian and
Jerry Lewis (who really is a
comedian) is a hard-nosed chat-
show host. In a desperate attempt to
get on his show, the comedian
kidnaps the host and although the
result is extremely funny, at the end
the audience is left with a sense of
tragedy rather than comedy. When
released it became Scorsese's only
commercial and critical flop but it is
now being recognised as a brilliant
example of how laughter is so often
used to hide lonliness and pain.
In the early 70's there were a
number of films made of rock
festivals and tours and Scorsese was
involved in some of the best.
Woodstock is a recording of the
festival in summer 1969, and
includes footage of many of the
greats of the 60's; Hendrix, Joplin,
The Who, etc. Woodstock was the
climax of the dreams of a decade
where as in contrast Medicine Ball
Caravan, made only two years later
and conceived -as a sequel to
Woodstock, saw it all falling apart,
but there is some great music
nontheless. Elvis on Tour was made
at the same time as Medicine Ball
Caravan but it shows Presley at his
peak, on the road before his rapid
decline. The latest film in the whole
season is the recently released Round
Midnight, set in the wonderfully
seedy Paris jazz club of the 1950's.
Scorsese actually acts in this, but the
plot is unimportant; the gorgeously
mellow jazz stands by itself.
Scorsese's latest two films as
director are on show as well. After
Hours is a hilarious yet chilling black
comedy, in which a man survives a
living nightmare, marooned, alone
and penniless one night in
Manhatten, with most of the very
weird population trying to kill him!
The Colour of Money stars Paul
Newman and is a sequel to The
Hustler, made 25 years ago. It has
yet to be released in this country but
when it does it is likely to be a huge
hit.
Scorsese has frequently been
accused of relying too much on his
background of underground life in
New York, and of the guilt that
seems to result from the staunchly
Catholic upbringings. His off-hand
treatment of women in his films has
also been attacked. However, with
experience and maturity this has
changed, and anyway it seems
natural that, in order to obtain the
sort of realism that Scorsese seeks,
he should work from his own past
experience. What is undeniable is
that Scorsese's films work on every
level â€” they provide good
entertainment as they always have
excellent scripts, storylines and
scenery, but at the same time are
original and highly intelligent. He
always works on low budget and
does not rely greatly on commercial
success or failure, and consequently
makes the films he wants to make.
He is a unique director and The
Scorsese Album is going to be one of
the major film events of 1987. If you
have never seen a Scorsese film
