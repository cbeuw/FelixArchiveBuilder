OPINION
Gideon Lichfield, Chairman of IC Jewish Society, talks about
exhibitions, opinions, and...
Wasted Emotion
F r o m M a r c h 5 to 7, the Jewish Society
held an exhibition i n the J C R about
Israel's position in the Middle East,
entitled 'There is another way'.
' H o w does this justify t h e Israeli
treatment of the 'Palestinians?' called out
one person as he left the exhibition. H e
apparently just wanted to make this stab
and get out without waiting for the
answer, w h i c h was that the display didn't
mention t h e treatment of the
Palestinians—that wasn't what it was
that many people saw in o u r exhibition,
which is w h y w e had deliberations about
putting it up.
A more balanced exhibition would have
included material showing another
facet—the Palestinians' legitimate rights to
self-determination, which various
occupying powers have denied them in
the past, a n d the diverse problems still
facing them. T h e difficulty in portraying
so many entangled issues, is to give a
'balanced' perspective in a small space.
That, then, is m y opinion. But I could
about. W h y not? I hear y o u ask.
"And they shall beat their swords into
plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall
they learn war any more."
The majority of people are pretty
uninformed about the Israel-Palestine
debate. Those of us w h o are interested
parties, the Zionists (I can't say Jews,
because some Jews are not Zionists) and
the Palestinians, should be educating
everyone else. There has been a fair
amount of 'education' this year, with last
term's Friends of Palestine stall i n the
JCR and articles in Felix b y a variety of
people. Some of this material has been
reasonable and well-argued. Some has
been rampantly anti-Zionist and even
anti-Semitic. But I can't say that our
exhibition, w h i c h was provided b y the
Union of Israeli Students of this country,
was a balanced and objective counter to
the bias, because it wasn't. W e justify
putting it up nonetheless, because it
brought up some inescapable facts—facts
in the light of which some of Israel's
m o r e distasteful actions become
understandable, even if y o u don't support
them. It also highlighted the peace treaty
between Egypt a n d Israel as an example
of what can be achieved through
negotiation.
But did it d o enough? This form of
'education', where the general public is
left to sort out what truth they can form
a barrage of information from both sides,
is very c o m m o n and, in m y opinion, very
wasteful. There is a tendency b y pro-
Palestinian groups to give the impression
that Israel a n d Zionism are the source for
almost all the Palestinians' problems,
though in both the past and the present
their sufferings have also been due to
mistreatment b y other Middle Eastern
countries and to their o w n internal
conflicts. This practice is as dangerous as
that of portraying Israel as a g e m in a sea
of iniquity. This last is the very message
equally well have argued that nobody
voicing support for the Palestinians has
tried to present a fair picture which also
shows the problems that Israel has had to
face, so w h y should we? That is a view
held b y many people w h o have
experienced the worst realities of anti-
Zionism and anti-Semetism a n d have had
to fight back. Imperial College, however,
is not exactly a hotbed of political activity
and therefore w e should be able to
discuss these issues more calmly.
W h e n certain people express views or
interpret history i n a w a y I, as a Zionist,
find unacceptable, it is sometimes done
we can agree on.
There are a few such patches of
c o m m o n ground, b y and large: mutual
recognition, self-determination and the
right to an independent state for both
peoples. Each side spends too m u c h
energy at the moment trying to persuade
the public that it is right. T h e energy
should go into dialogue. W e are just
groups of students with different opinions;
we are not experiencing the real thing in
the Middle East, so there is even less
reason for us to hurl public abuse at each
others' ideologies. This dialogue should
not even be with a n y expectations or
goals, just talking to see where the
c o m m o n ground lies. F r o m the brief
experience I've had I k n o w that it is like
tiptoeing through a minefield, a n d
similarly nerve-racking, to follow the
thread of agreement and understanding
without blowing up in a series of
accusations. This kind of talking is hard
work, but it w o u l d leave everyone else
free to go a n d read some history books
and draw their o w n conclusions.
Y o u m a y ask what this friendly chatting
intends to achieve. The answer is that
even if there are no concrete results, it is
better than animosity, and it probably
reduces the chances of a coronary in
later life for a l l concerned. Just because
different bits of the rest of the world are
shouting at each other, doesn't mean that
the corridors of IC should be echoing
with recrimination.
It is said that where there are two
Jews, there are three opinions. If y o u
spoke to a n y Jewish Society members at
the exhibition, y o u m a y have come away
with this impression. The exhibition was
IT
without any malice intended at all, but
simply because they sincerely believe
what they are saying. During the three
days of the exhibition I spoke to many
different A r a b students. W e w o u l d often
reach an issue o n which w e could not,
and never will, agree, such as h o w to
define the violence perpetrated b y the
P L O : terrorism o r 'legitimate' guerilla
warfare? W i t h those people w h o were not
worked up into a frenzy of indignation at
the contents of the display, it was
possible to achieve a kind of mutual
understanding: it's fruitless to try a n d
convert each other to our views on this
issue, let's steer round it o n to something
intended, if nothing else, to jolt people
into asking questions and to act as a
reminder that the Jewish Society exists
and has thaings to say. W e are a diverse
bunch and o u r views span a wide range.
Y o u have been reading one opinion,
written b y one Jew. N o w , if y o u care at
all about what happens in the Middle
East, go and find some more opinions,
from as many different people as possible.
Y o u will discover a bloodstained tapestry
of stories, y o u will realise w h y it is so
difficult, nay, impossible, to reach a
consensus and y o u will, I hope, come to
the conclusion that the past is a very
rocky foundation indeed.
