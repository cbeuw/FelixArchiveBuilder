Access Update New Dean
M r Tony Cullen, Assistant Registrar, has
almost completed the allocation of money
from the Access Fund to undergraduates.
He has assessed the claims of all but
twelve students and has given the money
awarded to the Heads of department, to
distribute before the end of term.
Postgraduate claims are also being
assessed and have been dealt with in the
main, but have been given a lower
priority, so that undergraduates can
receive their money before the end of
term.
A new Dean has been appointed to City
and Guilds College. The post will be filled
by Professor B. Mc. A. Sayers PhD,
DSc(Eng), DIC, FCGI, FIEE a n d FEng. His
appointment as Dean of the College runs
from 1st September 1991 to 31st August
1994.

Jen Hardy-Smith, Union Administrator, is
to retire during the Easter Holidays,
having been at the centre of the Union
for 17 years. She intends to move into
the country a n d spend her time
gardening. Jen said although she would
miss the fun of working around students,
one thing that she certainly would not
miss would be minuting council reports.
Last Friday the Felix press once again
refused to print anything. T h e ever
unreliable press was out of action for the
weekend, due to the seizing of an
essential bearing. The breakdown
coincided with an occasion when it was
required for weekend use. After initially
causing concern for the Wednesday
deadline with a new expected publication
date of Thursday, the event merely put
back publication by a few hours to
Wednesday afternoon.
News Editorial
Red Nose day has brought up a couple of
issues w h i c h are relevent to the news
team. The first is Imperial College apathy;
what happened to the lot of you? Where
were all the red noses? The answer is
that they were few and far between.
Sure, Felix should inform y o u of what is

going on, but if you didn't k n o w about
Comic Relief, then there's something
wrong with you.
The second issue raised is that it's quite
difficult to find out what is going on at
college. The news pages can only inlclude
the information that we get hold of, so if
y o u k n o w of something interesting, which
might make a news story, call us.
Telephone 3515 internal (make a note of
it).
Now for the gripes. The bain of every
reporter's life is people trying to write
their news stories for them. Phrases like
'Please let me check the details before
y o u print it' just serve to irritate us. I'm
not picking on anyone in particular;
many people do this, so please don't. If
there's something I'm uncertain about, or
something that I may have got wrong, I
will check it. T h e news pages are rarely
inaccurate (well, not wildly), so don't
worry.
A n d the last thing. (Don't worry, I'll
shut up soon.) Felix news is still short
staffed. Andy's last desparate plea from
the editorial brought two people into the
office, one of them for news. At the time
of writing, there were three of us around
to do the majority of the news. This is
not enough. C o m e into the office and
give it a try.
