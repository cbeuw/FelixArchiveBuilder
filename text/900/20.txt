REM Out of Time
It's been a long two years since anything
REM-wise has come out of Athens. Time
enough for people to forget the
importance of the classic Green, but it
seems not long enough for R E M . This
album, altough i n texture completely
different, does seem to have hit a musical
cul-de-sac. Whilst all their other albums
have been completely independent
growing from each other, Out Of Time
draws heavily from past, noteably
Murmur and Document, but it can't get
out of its predecessor's shadow.
Let's face it. If you are reading this the
chances are y o u have/ will buy the
album. Trouble is I'm just a little fucked
off with R.E.M. at the moment, so this is
totally subjective. I a m not going to play
this record for a long, long time.

Bjork sings as well as a guppy gasping for
breath. She just doesn't have a song. Ever
since 'Birthday' she's gone completely
downhill. A s for Barney, w h y can't he
just fuck right off. What a stupid, stupid
introspective, nauseating voice. Lets face
it he can't exactly sing, c a n he?
The only side we'll listen to often is 2 B
(the last one). This contains a m a m m o t h
four tracks including In yer face and
Cubik. T h e rest, well if y o u feel like
shaking the walls down, put it on, push
up the bass and pump up the volume.

A dodgy d r u m intro leads into an even
more dodgy vocal. I don't k n o w what
he's talking about, i n fact what's the point
of this record? Anybody???
Congratulations
It sounds like James' bastard brother, but
it drool's all over the place and the lead
singer has a Cure (ish) slur to his voice.
This gets ten o n the love-rating, and
definitely W a r n e r Corner single of the
decade.

If I've told you once
The scene: A scouser's bedroom, and it's
band practise. Terry (scouser) 'Ere lads,
I've got this fuckin' ace this new sound,
just listen'. Unfortunately, at this point
Terry's m u m comes in and tells the rest
of the band to piss off back to their o w n
houses, and starts hoovering. This means
we are left w i t h the same o l d bollocks
everyone elese is playing these d a y s -
and what a fucking stupid name.
UK Tag: Interview
UK Tag formed i n 1989 and are a four-
piece band from H a r r o w w i t h Jason (23
years old, guitar, vocals and lyrics), Mike
(23, guitar), Morgan (23, bass and
artwork) and A n d r e w (26, drums).
Describing themselves as funky thrash
pop our intrepid F E L I X hacks adjourned
to a particularly shite pub o n the
Brompton Road to interrogate Jason and
Mike.
Interrogation Squad: W h e r e are y o u
coming from sound-wise, dudes?
U K Tag: Well good reference points
would be The Smiths (yup!), The Jam,
Talking Heads; a lot of the N e w W a v e
bands and also like a bit of jazz like Miles
Davis and some of the A c i d Jazz stuff.
W e would like to make it clear we're not
an typical indie band.
IS: W h y did y o u decide to do the
record yourselves?
U K : W e l l the major record labels are
money grabbing corporate scum. They
wouldn't have allowed the packaging,
there would have been too m u c h
pressure about w h i c h songs to include,
the lyrical content and overall
presentation. Doing it this way, w e can
then go to a major and show we're
capable of getting it all together before
they've had to take a risk with us. Also
we're lucky i n that w e have an 'in-house'
designer (Morgan) so w e can have a
decent packaging job done. Presentation
is all important.
IS: So y o u a r e interested i n long term
commercial success?
U K : O h most definitely. W e don't want to
be a cult band forever. That's all very
well for a while, but w e don't want to be
40 playing Ronnie Scott's and worrying
about how to pay the mortgage.
IS: What do y o u do for work?
UK: W e don't. W e feel lucky we're doing
something w e really want to do. Feel
sorry for people w h o have to work, I
mean, I could never do something as a
means to an end just for the money.
IS: How about the Moral Majority and
stickering albums?
U K : Stickers o n albums are great, they
help to sell records. T h e Moralists are just
a bunch of hypocrites, sinning all week,
going to church o n Sunday and expect to
be forgiven.
IS: Well they're paying for it o n the
astral.
Americans?
UK: Checked trousers, flat caps and big
cameras. (Much laughing all round). Only
reason we'd want to go there is for the
money. A m e r i c a is money.
Well, a couple of nicer geezers y o u
couldn't wish to meet. Unfortunately their
record does suffer from the low-budget
production job, but it's early days yet and
they've certainly got the drive to d o
better. I'll drink to that.
The Amateurs EP
Hello there pop-pickers, and here w e
have a six-track E P from a n e w band
w h o come from that rock ' n ' roll suburb
of Harrow-on-t he-Hill. A n d yes, it does
have that revered Harrow sound. Of not
very much. T h e lead track Carry Me
Away is tepid sub-funk with that jingly
guitar bit half-inched from Prince's Kiss,
the bass not very loud at all and, well,
the song never really leaves the
launchpad. Your Flag in my Face sounds
exactly like something off Side 2 of The
Smiths' Hatful of Hollow with a bit of
funk added, whilst the singer sounds like
a cross between Morrissey at 33x
h and
James Maker from Raymonde. O n the last
track Soak the guitars are turned up (a
little bit) and speeded up with not a lot of
effect and it ends in a couple of minutes
of studio (mar)larking about w h i c h is
totally useless. They're meant to be better
live and maybe they are, but this record
is pretty innocuous and does not excite
me one teeny bit. Fact.
