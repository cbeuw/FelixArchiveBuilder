What's On
Past promises
Dear Andy,
Perhaps you could help me. I seem to
remember that back in the dim distant
past of 1988, you and I were among 400
students who moved into Southside. I
could have sworn that the Reapps back
then were getting hot under the collar
about 'huge rent increases' and 'exploiting
Freshers'. They wrote letters and
compared figures and said ugly things
like 'most expensive student
accommodation in Britain' and 'rent
strike'. 1 was even under the impression
that the highly organised authorities from
across the road responded. Perhaps I am
wrong, but 1 could have sworn that a
quote like 'no further rent rises for the
next three years' emanated from the
mass of red tape. I understand that you
will shortly be rejoining us in Southside.
Perhaps when you do, you will be kind
enough to check your rent bill. Mine now
appears to be £46 per week, a rise of
£6pw over the past two years.
There also seems to be a new
requirement this year, which has come as
a surprise to resident, warden and
Clinical
Apologies
Dear Andy,
On behalf of the silent majority at
Mary's 1 would like to apologise to the IC
Union candidates who came to the
Hustings on Monday 4th and had to
defend themselves against the absolute
peak of arrogance and bad manners that
are so legendary to medics. In the face of
the successful merger agreement and the
wholly reasonable stand taken by the
candidates in the few brief moments
when they were given the chance to set
out their views, this behaviour was
inexcusable and may with some
justification have pushed IC-Mary's
relations back into the Dark Ages.
However, the date set for the Hustings,
on the first day of Rag Week, was
unfortunate and 1 hope that in the light of
this those candiates will take their
reception at Mary's with a large pinch of
salt. Please rest assured that Mary's
politics (illegible—TS) are usually slightly
more sober, and the majority who were
there will probably cringe with
embrarrassment when they look back on
Monday night's events.
A Mary's Student,
Name Withheld by Request.
I know at least one candidate who'll
be happy to hear this. Thanks.

Student Union alike. We are required to
clear our rooms over the Easter break or
pay four weeks full rent, as opposed to
the usual one week. Perhaps this is
because the college residence fund has
done something stupid like overbook the
conference facilities or run up a £21
million overdraft.
Please tell me, are my suspicions
accurate or am I just another left-wing,
layabout student in the grip of a drug
induced hallucination?
Yours sincerely,
Charles Sanderson, Selkirk Reapp.
Your suspicions are accurate
(although I don't know about the
hallucinations and drugs). However,
due to some frantic work by E l
Presidente, the Easter thing is sorted
out: You're only going to have to pay
a weeks rent to leave your gear in
your room.

P.S. The overdraft is actually only
£20.5 Million...

I'd just like to thank Spenser Lane for
this letter, which was one of the most
sparkling pieces of self-gratification
I've ever seen. Cheers Spenser, it
gave us all a good laugh and was
quite good at heating up the office at
3 am the other morning...
