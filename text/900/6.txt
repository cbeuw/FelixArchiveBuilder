Limerick
A young engineer from Imperial
Pursued a career managerial.
She...Ha! caught you out,
This limerick by Noel Petty won a prize
in a New Statesman and Society Weekend You crude sexist lout:
Competition during the summer. Spotted
by Professor Peter Richards of St Mary's. The gender was quite immaterial
Illusion
The sunlight filters through the trees,
Ever so gently flows the breeze,
Carrying scents of fields unsown,
Images of lands unknown.
Gracefully evolve the deer,
Blue sea gently sheds a tear.
Deep inside his dreamy eye
Reflects a peaceful golden sky.
He looks at her and their minds meet,
As both their hearts forget one beat.
Their words echo the tenderness inside.
Shyly, they reveal what they tried to hide.
The birds sing as their world goes round,
Inside their breasts the same pulsating
sound.
He and she suddenly have discovered
The secret beauty Nature mothered.
Hans Crockett, Physics 1.
