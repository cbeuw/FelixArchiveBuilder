More facts and figures To join or
Dear Editor,
In response to Yasmin Saudi's article
entitled 'Facts and Figures', I would like
to correct some of Miss Saudi's figures
themselves.
'The UN General Assembly set a
partition plan for Palestine in October
1947 to create two states, one for the
Jews and one for the Arabs', and to alot
the Jewish State 56.6% of the land of
Palestine of which 90% was Arab owned
and 50% Palestinian Arab populated.
Well 81% of the land of Palestine was
already in Arab hands. Britain had set up
the Kingdom of Trans Jordan on most of
the land of Palestine. The 56.6% of the
remaining 20% alloted to be a Jewish
State was for the most part hostile desert
and coastal sand dunes. 90% was not
Arab owned. British government statistics
maintain that prior to the state, 8.6% of
the land area now known as Israel was
owned by Jews; 3.3% by Arabs who
remained there; 16.5% by Arabs who'd
left the country. More than 70% was
' owned by the Government. Under
International law, ownership passed to
Israel in 1948. (Survey of Palestine, 1946,
British Mandate Government p.257).
Thre was never a 50% population of
Palestinian Arabs in the territory
allocated to Israel, though there was a
massive population increase; the infant
mortality amongst Moslems was recorded
to have fallen from 19.6% in 1922 to 14%
in 1939, the non-Jewish population soared
by 75.2% as Jewish revitalisation of the
area brought in thousands of Arab
immigrants from Syria and Egypt during
the mandate, Britain simultaneously
limiting Jewish immigration in the
notorious 'white papers' 1921, 1929 and
1939. Arab increase was largest in areas
of intensive Jewish development—Jaija
216%, Jaffa 134% and Jerusalem 90%
(contrasted with 42% in Shechem (Nablus)
40% in Jenin) (...statistics taken from the
Palestine Royai Commission Report 1937
p279).
The Arab immigration was undoubtedly
higher, as above statistics are for those
'Palestinians' who immigrated with all the
required formalities, as opposed to those
who crossed into Palestine quietly.
UNRWA ultimately defined a Palestinian
Refugee as a needy person whose normal
residence was Palestine for a minimum of
two years preceding the outbreak of the
conflict of 1948. Britain was of course
restricting Jewish immigration to 10,000 a
year for five years.
'The independence of Israel was not the
independence of the indigenous people of
Palestine' how indigenous were the
Palestinian Arabs? If we talk about
expulsions, surely we should differentiate
between those Arabs who left temporarily
to make room for the liberating armies of
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq, and the
hundreds of thousands of Jews who were
expelled from the Arab countries.
'White democracy does riot constitute
an integral part of most Arab regimes, it
is not absent. Egypt has licensed parties...'
I know there is a measure of freedom of
speech in Egypt. Egypt has a peace-treaty
with Israel, that was one of the central
themes of the Jewish Society exhibition!
'In Jordan democratic elections took
place recently'—true again. King Hussain
has eliminated any serious opponents. He
killed 20,000 Palestinians in 'Black
September' and many other people since
(if Jassir Arafat is so interested in
promoting the welfare of Palestine why
has he been so supportive of their worst
enemy?).
'It should have been specified that the
only states linked to terrorism are Syria,
Libya and Iraq'.—well that's Miss Saudi's
words not mine. I could argue but why
split hairs?
'Violence and upheaval have been
worsened by the impact of Israel', I think
the opposite is true. The only thing the
Arab states can get united about is the
annihilation of Israel!
As to the rest of the article, let's just
say that a claim by Arafat that the
National Charter (which calls for the total
elimination of Palestine as its objective,
with armed struggle as the only means of
attaining the objective) is lapsed, although
in the formal verse (illegible—TS) it is still
operative may be acceptable to Yasmin
Saudi, but to the people of Israel, who
remember Fatah attrocities such as the
'Metullah Kindergarten massacre, and
who have seen PLO terrorist attacks
attempted by Fatah since the famous
1989 declaration, are rather more
sceptical.
If progress will be made in solving the
Palestinian Problem, the Palestinians will
need to find a better representative than
the PLO.
They can only offer Israel peace and
security in exchange for land. If Israel is
not convinced that she will gain any
peace or security but rather, will be
indefensible to old threats -plus a new
one, her people cannot take the risk.
Would you trust Mr Arafat if your life and
those of your family were threatened?
The purpose of the J-Soc exhibition was
to show the students of Britain what sort
of organisation the PLO is. In retrospect a
waste of time as by joining Iraq in their
Jihad, Mr Arafat has done a better job
than any student here ever could.

Dear Andy,
Following the grand pledges of the
Union presidential candidates at the
Hustings on Thursday night to get post-
graduates more involved with the Union,
I feel compelled to explain exactly why
we post-grads don't tend to be
particularly enthusiastic.
To start with, I don't beleive I have
ever seen such a pathetic show for a
Hustings, heard such inane questions and
some fairly inane answers to boot. It
should have been held at lunchtime,
when 'average' students are in the JCR,
not just candidate-groupies, whose mental
agility only stretches as far as designing
and testing paper aeroplanes during
speeches, and sabbaticals heckling.
There were, for instance, no questions
about the total failure by the present
sabbaticals to publicise either the opening
or closing of nominations, the hustings or
the ballot times. And this college, with
such excellent printing facilities on site. A
spot in FELIX (if there was one) is simply
not enough—not even someone as
'interested' as myself manages to procure
a copy every week. Instead, it has been
left to the candidates to advertise this,
one of the most fundamental events of
the Union calendar. Does the Union have
a Publicity Officer? If so, what does s/he
do?
Another very grating point is that of
'dealing with issues that relate to
students'—a much over-used cliche on
Thursday night. I would like to know
precisely how the new Union President
(or the old one, come to that) intends to
fight such important 'relevant' legislation
as the deregulation of Student Unions,
further deterioration of the grant system
and increased dependence on loans, the
abolition of Housing Benefits and the
expensive and futile chasing of students
for poll tax, without national backing...i.e.
membership of the National Union of
Students. How one college, prestigious
though it is (or was), believes it can
influence the government on its' own is
beyond me. Only with colleges united
nationwide do students stand any chance
of bargaining power regarding the above
issues.
Besides, as Paul Shanley admitted to
me last year, this Union receives
information and guidance from NUS
London via ULU, so why shouldn't we
pay for it? Many poorer colleges across
London manage it somehow. On asking
said President whether he thought this
somewhat hypocritical, he simply
shrugged. The mind boggles as to what
excuse next years' lot will come up with.
What amazes me most is that I'm
supposed to be leaning towards
30
not to join?
Thatcherite right, being 'older' and in the
Management School. However, this place
makes me look positively radical, a
raving lefty even. Quite stunning. If I'd
known what sort of a shambles this place
was in, I would have stood for President
myself—the Union could do with a decent
manager, judging by the shape it's in at
the moment—but then, I didn't even get
to hear about the opening of the
nominations. No sign of any posters in
my department, anyhow.
Your average IC student is apathetic
and probably drink-orientated...like many
thousands all over the country. Your
average post-grad is very busy under a
great deal of work pressure. This Union
stands no chance of attracting either with
its present sloppy, non-committal,
lacklustre attitude.
Yours,
Gaynor de Wit, MSc Management,
The Management School.
P.S. Just in case you think I'm one of
those armchair complainers, I was
Publicity Officer and Societies Chair (and
even ran for President!) at my old
Students' Union at an engineering,
science and business-based college like IC,
full of apathetic students like IC, but at
least we got a decent turn out of
'switched on' students for most Union
events through use of effective
posters/campaigns/flysheets.
IC is not a member of the NUS due to
the result of a college-wide
referendum, which decided that IC
should disaffiliate from the NUS.
There have since been further
referendums to decide whether we
should remain disaffiliated. So it
wasn't the Union's decision, but the
students'.

Religion and
Dear Andy,
Ok. Some replies...
1. Andy 'Logical' Cooksley (896). Don't
think about going into Law. To quote
Monty Python, his letter "....is interesting
from the point of view of a professional
logician as it contains a number of
fallacies."
I believe your first point states that the
premise that the bible is fiction is as bad
as saying that it isn't. Whether or not it is
fiction I will come to later; but it is
irrelevant to the point that I was trying to
make. The summary of what I was saying
(which you should have been able to
deduce given only one brain cell) was
that a majority of the population of the
world do not believe that the bible is
reliable factual evidence and therefore
one cannot base an argument on it.
Similarly it would be no use explaining to
a barbarian with a broken Polaroid that it
has run out of film if he believes that it
has inside it a miniature artistic demon:
you would have to prove it to him first,
by opening it. Of course you cannot
easily prove the bible, and Christians
often reply that 'God told me its true.'
Secondly, I suggest you look up the
words premiss and conclusion. You could
easily say 'Let's assume there is life after
death then....' as indeed I already have in
a previous letter. But let's look at the
next statement: 'according to St Paul's
letter to the Corinthians there is life after
death.' Let's look at the two premisses: 1)
St Paul really wrote it. 2) St Paul was an
authority on the subject (he hadn't been
dead after all). The phrase 'there is life
after death' has suddenly become a
conclusion! Which is, in fact, the opposite
of a premiss. So yes, you are right,
Cooksley, I would not allow it. Suddenly
no good. It is no good because the two
premisses are themselves deduced from
the premiss that the bible is true. Which
it isn't.
It amazes me that someone can sound
so smug and self- righteous ('Hmmm,
novel logic.') and yet be so utterly
incorrect! We finally have you, not on
some debatable point about the bible, but
on the hard fact that your letter is
logically, unarguabley wrong. Its
BULLSHIT. Not only is it illogical, but you
attempted to prove that I am illogical!! Ha
ha ha!! It is this kind of blind faith that is
typical of Christians.
2. Bible, fact or fiction. Before
considering the bible, lets take a look at
David Gemmel's new book. It's entitled
'The Lion of Macedonia', and is set in
ancient Greece. It details events and
battles that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
Around these it details the lives and
interactions of various characters, some
LETTERS
Logic (?)
of whom also existed. According to the
Christian logic, because we can prove
that the battles etc actually happened we
can happily say that the book is a work
of fact. That because the book gives
accurate dates and places, then obviously
the characters actually SAID the things in
the book. This is the what Giles and the
Christian hierarchy would have us believe
about the bible.
Yes Giles, there are many events
detailed in the bible that actually
happened. There is much evidence to
suggest that a meteorite hit the earth and
caused several days of darkness, just as
detailed in the bible. But according to the
bible it happened because we crucified
Jesus. According to the bible, Moses went
into the hills and God carved the ten
commandments for him to bring back.
What ACTUALLY happened was that
Moses went off alone and came back with
the ten commandments which he SAID
God carved. I certainly believe that Moses
existed, but it in no way proves that God
does.
But, I hear you cry, Jesus was
proclaimed prophet long' before the
meteorite hit, so the other signs must
have been true, thus God made the
meteorite hit earth. Bollocks. We forget
that every hundred or, so years someone
is born and is proclaimed prophet or son-
of-god for his radical views of society. But
only when, by coincidence, some major
event like a meteorite, do people take
this seriously enough to record the story
and eventually base a religion around it.
Also, at this point we notice that a
significant number of people obviously
told a different story to their children as
the vast majority of people in the Middle-
East became Muslims. The events all
happened in the Middle-East and
presumably all the people who are now
Muslims are descendants of the people
who witnessed the events of the bible.
However the main fault of the
Christian's argument is that it also applies
to the Koran and the texts of Buddhism
and Hinduism. They do not seem to
realise that, by their own faulty logic,
their god is only one of many, and that
most other religions are valid. So Giles,
either your argument is utter bullshit, or
the Koran and Gemmel's book are also
non-fiction. Who's walking on thin air
now, you smug git?
And what's this about 'Jesus may or
may not have walked on water,
depending on what you believe' ? Either
he did, because the bible said so, or you
have to admit that the whole of the bible
contains fallacies.
Yours,
Athena
