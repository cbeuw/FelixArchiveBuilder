The Slow Moving Snail on the trail of reality...
Books for Revolution
I write this for you to read. It is a means
of communicating, just like music, art,
advertising and scientific journals. But
what can be read into what is
communicated and why? What can we
find out by taking apart the pieces of a
message? Can breaking the hidden 'codes'
itself be a subversive activity, not only
threatening the stability of society but
also our sense of reality?
Foucault's Pendulum is set in the world
of academic publishing, in a time frame
of at least four moments. The main
character waits in a museum dedicated to
the history of science, waiting for the
answer to an enigma that unfolds in long
flashbacks, whilst the pendulum swings.
The enigma is wrapped in history, as told
through the meaning of numbers and
stories. A game begins, elaborating an
ultimate story. W i t h the disappearance of
a character, the involvement of an
unexplainably inquisitive detective and a
mysterious sage who acts as if he has
lived forever, their innocent game maybe
becoming more than just a story. For
where does reality begin...?
This book is a scientist's nightmare,
losing their tightly gripped security
blanket of an objective reality - losing it
in a world that they use to weave that
blanket, the history of science. Structured
into many short chapters, this long book
constructs, on a foundation of increasing
suspense, a mystery of magic, knowledge
and power. For the transformation of
sitting in a chair into an adventure just
add one ingredient, Umberto Eco's book.
If you have not yet read Eco's first best-
seller The Name of the Rose then read it.
The Professor of Public Understanding of
Science, John Durant, uses its plot to
review a new book, A l a n Gross's 'The
Rhetoric of Science'. The concept of a
book and its advocation of a particular
style of expression or analysis - in 'The
Name of the Rose' it is comedy - as a
threat to the established power is an
evocative image. It has often been used
in marketing books, or religions.
The art of selling statements as
knowledge is the theme of Gross's book.
Threatening the world of objectivity,
claiming that truth is socially constructed.
Durant defends truth in his review, being
'almost embarrassed at having to spell it
out'. Yet there are exciting attempts to
explain the history of ideas without
reference to their truth value. Shapin and
Schaffer have published a book that
examines the foundation of the Royal
Society and its attempts to establish
experiment as the proper foundation of
new knowledge. A battle between the
philosophers and the experimentalists,
seeking social and political stability via a
knowledge that itself was stable in its
certainty. Leviathan and the Air Pump
looks at the relationship between Hobbes
and Boyle in the seventeenth century.
Shapin and Schaffer sell their idea well.
This attempt to sociologize the history
of science has itselfbeen interpreted as a
fight on political grounds, the sociologists
being seen as left-wing radicals
undermining the objectivity of history!
W h e n Wells was a student here he was
so bored in lectures and practicals that he
would visit the Victoria and Albert
Museum to forget the world of science
studies. A new exhibition a n d associated
book was launched there just last month.
They are called The Art of Selling Songs
and analyse the historical development
and contemporary trends in marketing
music. Intertwining technological changes
with the skill of transforming musical
themes into printed symbols. Explaining
what goes into the design of the
wrapping for this commodity. The book is
beautifully illustrated, with over eighty
colour prints and ninety black and white.
This is the first attempt to analyse the
history of marketing music. Students can
buy copies at the reduced price of £9:95,

At Imperial the historians of science are
breaking-new ground in their research
into the portrayal of science in public
journals and newspapers. Also they are
examining the iconography of popularist
books, in their selling of ideas. This
college has some wonderful hidden
corners where you can find the cracking
of the authority of stereotyped science.
