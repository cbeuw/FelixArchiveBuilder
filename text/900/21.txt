Hold you Tonight Piouhgd
Is this American? Does this record have a
typically sexist picture of the (not so)
attractive M s K e m p o n the cover? Is this
destined for M T V land? Really Warner,
we are being a bit shallow here aren't
we.
Rod Stewart
Rhythm of the Heart
W i t h this, good o l d Rod tries to emulate
the sucess of the (covered) D o w n t o w n
Train. Yeah, good old Rod with his ever
so sexy girlfriend. In fact, how does he
manage to get all those blondes??
Answers o n a postcard please.

Editorial
This is one of the few occasions that I'm
going to follow in the editor's footsteps
and give m y personal opinion, but this
must be said. Approximately a month ago
I phoned W . E . A . to inquire about the up
coming R.E.M. promotional visit- given i n
the music press. I was told that in fact
the article in Melody Maker was incorrect
and that R.E.M. were not coming to
England at all.
Several weeks later, 13.3.91, R.E.M.
were playing a live set o n Radio 1. T h e
following moring I phoned W . E . A and
asked, seeing as their plans had changed,
was there any chance of a press
conference, or maybe an interview (ever
the optimist). I was told that all press w a s
conducted the day before, and that there
was no chance of any more promotion. I
was given the name of a w o m a n w h o
was handling R.E.M.'s visit and as a
departing sentence I was told, 'Oh, and
by the way, they (R.E.M.) a r e playing two
secret gigs at the Borderline, one tonight
and the other tomorrow.' I phoned the
w o m a n who told m e that there was no
chance of an interview, no chance of a
press conference and no guest list.
The Borderline was engaged all day, and
so I decided to go there to see if I could
purchase tickets (5.30 pm). I' was told that
all tickets for both gigs were sold out
three weeks ago. I waited several hours
to see if I could get in. It became
apparent as the ticket holders arrived that
only record company officials, musicians
and people in the k n o w who had access
to them. There was also a guest list- I
saw the name of Ivo Watts o n it. I could
have purchased a ticket from a tout, "
anything between £30-200. R.E.M.'s naive
intentions to play secret gigs for the fans
sadly got no further than their own self-
serving record company, w h i c h leaves m e
out in the cold and worst of all, lied to
and feeling like shit. Thanks a lot
Warner.
This has to be a bit of a quicky, seeing as
there are about 25 records to be
reviewed i n o n e and a half pages, so
without further a do, word association...
Gross. Great. Epileptic. Twisted. Hurdy
Gurdy. Intestinal. Warped. Black Sabbath.
Disease. Plasmic. Bone breaking. Shite.

IC 8.3.91
The Soul to Soul references were
completely justified. Despite a rather
stilted stage presence, Soul Family
Sensation produced a powerful, and most
importantly, danceable sound. T h e female
vocalist was completely spot o n .
However, the male vocalist sounded like
he should have been in a nothern guitar
band, and if y o u think on, the two just
don't mix. O h , and the keyboard players
need to try some of those 'Wacky Mars
Bars' (see other review!!) before they do
anything good. Good luck to 'em.

Milltown
Brothers
Slinky LP
This band are masters of the art of being
trendy by trying not be trendy. Deftly
avoiding the Mancland scene (they hail
from Colne, 30 miles away), not wearing
baggy stripped shirts, swinging jeans or
pudding bowls they have produced an
album more growable than Jack's
beanstalk. F r o m the passionate pop of
'Apple Green' and 'Which w a y should I
Jump?' to the more moody numbers o n
side t w o they show a maturity that o n e
would normally expect from a bands
third or fourth offering. A n y band that
uses guitars will inevitably be compared
to R E M and U 2 and, considering their
roots, all the shaggy bands as well. They
mix all the best elements together,
leaving all the chaff and taking the
kernels. This is defiantly a n album to
have in your collection and to all those
people -that think everything from
Manchester sounds the same, open your
ears and listen to this.

What can I say? Already hyped in the
music press, and having just completed a
national tour (culminating in supporting
Ride) Slowdive release a new(ish) single.
The titles admirably express the emotions
of the record - Morningrise giving that
feeling of w a k i n g up, N O T with a stinking
hangover, but with a refreshed body and
mind and a sense of cleanliness. Slowdive
produce a wonderful sound from within
themselves, like d e w i n the cool morning,
washing away the greyness of the night.
This review is utter bollocks but the
band's good anyway.

Ride Today Forever
Ride's fourth E P shows a slight mellowing
in their style. T h e vocals are still
nochalant and dreamy and the lead track
Unfamiliar has a totally essential bass-line.
Their best yet, but there's n o real overall
progression from their previous records
and w e wouldn't want them to get stuck
in a rut now, would we?
Dominic.
Flowing straight off a ship in trouble y o u
could find yourself reaching for the
starboard bow. It's twisted melodies sway
uncomfortably from side to side. Visions
of pan pipe hipsters and indian peace
pipes stray past the eyes. Cool as an
iceberg's heart in winter, associating with
this one could be tough. Sides A and B;
weird city. N o w play the edge!
Christ
The Telescopes
Celeste
A somnambulist's jaunt through the
recesses of the mind, a trip along the
higher plains of reality. Starting where
the 13th Floor Elevators left off, they
continue using bass to carry you forward
and onwards towards fulfillment. Fuck the
average and mundane, leave Ride
shagged o n the baron rocks of normality.
Explore your inner self and buy this
record. Face the facts, it's not bad if you
like this sort of thing.
