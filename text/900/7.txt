Viewpoint FELIX
What do you think of the various college shops, eating
places etc. and do you believe in the Easter Bunny?
• I can't answer questions like
not a spontaneous person.
• Y e a h — I do.
Dave:
• I was in the U F C that took the decision
to redesign the B O O K S H O P . It does not
do the job it should do...it should be a
proper academic bookshop...I'd have it
franchised to Dillons.
A t the time the changes were made,
they said the new ordering system they
were going to have, w o u l d guarantee that
a book you ordered would be there
within five days...the problem that I've
always had w i t h that bookshop is that it's
never had the books I've wanted.
• Oh—absolutely.
• I never go to the M D H 'cause it's shit. I
get m y snacks from the JCR...the
S O U T H S I D E S H O P is dead handy.
I eat at BELUSHIS—it's pretty good
value. I drink at SOUTHSIDE—it's good
fun meeting some A m e r i c a n totty.
• Of course I do.
• The M D H is a bit expensive...it's
alright—the food's good.
The UNION S N A C K B A R ' S quite
good...the sandwiches are really fresh—
they put the fillings in as you want them.
They're really good—worth the money.
I haven't eaten in the J C R . B E L U S H I S '
is alright apart from pizzas w h i c h are
quite expensive. The b a k e d potatoes are
quite good value for money. I've heard
that M U S T A P H A ' S is pretty gross.
The S O U T H S I D E S H O P is really
good...a little expensive but you'd expect
that—they could have concessions if
they're trying to provide a service for
students, rather than having a profitable
business. T h e y need to sell more fresh
fruit and veg and things like washing
powder as well.
• If I didn't believe in the Easter B u n n y I
wouldn't get all m y eggs on Easter
Day...I'm liberally minded...give me a few
years and I might grow up a bit.
Roger:
• In general the shops are very good as
are the eating places. The only
complaints I have are that there aren't
enough carrots on the m e n u and the
Bookshop doesn't have Watership D o w n
on video.
I'm glad to say that the barbaric
practice of eating rabbit seems to have
died out at Imperial.
• I think therefore I am.
Dan:
• I don't go to M U S T A P H A S at all—it's
just pointless. It's never open when I'm
about—it's better to go B E L U S H I S
because you're down in the bar already.
The food's not bad...the best you can get
for that sort of price.
The M D H is alright, but the food's not
that good—I only go there when I have
to.
The UNION S N A C K B A R is O K , but
they've totally cocked up the sandwich
bar—they're a l l pre-made a n d so dry.
They used to be made to order. The one
I had today—I could only eat half of it,
the rest was like the inside of a tree. The
hot food is fine.
I've never used the S O U T H S I D E S H O P .
• Depends on if she's an Easter Bunny
Girl or not.
