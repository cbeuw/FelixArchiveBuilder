W i t h these (and a lot of guts) y o u can
talk your way into Chinese-price air
tickets, train tickets and hotel rooms,
saving a small fortune during a long stay.
Be warned though, the police and public
security people can tell w h i c h are fake
cards. Fines are high, and Chinese cells
are not comfortable - I speak from
experience!
Buying your tickets is the next
problem. T r y i n g to get a ticket from a
seller who doesn't speak English and
doesn't want to serve you anyway is
daunting. W h e n y o u have just queued for
four hours as well, it can be frustrating to
fall at the final furlong because of the
communication barrier. To be dismissed
with the simple w o r d 'Mei-yo' meaning
'no', 'not possible', 'don't want' would try
the patience of Confucius. I learnt quickly
that the trick is to write d o w n the
instructions - the place you want to go,
the day, (today/tomorrow), and the class
of ticket. A l l these characters can be
copied from a phrase book.
This brings us onto the question of
language. Mandarin or Cantonese are not
the easiest to learn. E v e n for the Chinese,
reading is a slow business and children
take over ten years to read properly.
Speaking is based on a system of tones
which I seemed to be incapable of
making. Even w i t h a lot of effort, m y
speech was met with a lot of blank
expressions. W i t h practice y o u can master
the numbers, greetings, and a few food
names come in handy! It is, however,
vital to take a pocket phrase book to just
point to words written d o w n in it.
Planning your itinerary for China
depends on the time you have. The
distances are immense. It can take a
week to travel from Harbin in the north
to Kashgar in the southwest. The
temptation is to jump from town to town
by plane. But all Chinese towns are the
same, wide, concrete lined boulevards,
with sixties-style street lighting, and
characterless buildings. Treat the
overland travel as part of the trip, not an
inconvenience. China lies between the
towns; the real country is in the villages.
It is not easy to reach these, and
frequently long and exhausting bus or
train journeys are required. Two villages
which are perhaps easier to reach than
most are sleepy Yangshuo amongst
Guanxi's karst scenery in the south, and
the oasis town of Turfan, Xinjiang
province in the west.
Few Chinese would enjoy the sort of
pace that m a n y foreigners set themselves.
It is easy to become run d o w n . Y o u
should allow one day in four for logistics
and ticket bookings. Some provinces fall
into natural pairs, such as Y u n n a n and
Sichuan, Gansu and Xinjiang, Tibet and
Qinghai. There are themes you can
follow, like sailing through China,
concentrating on border regions or
minority areas, visiting Buddhist
mountains (like E m e i Shan and H u a n
Shan), or following the Silk Road.
It is possible to cross overland from
Pakistan on the K a r a k o r a m highway, or
from Nepal o n the Friendship Highway,
however the access of these roads
changes from year to year. The most
c o m m o n route to China is o n an
overnight ferry from H o n g Kong. Flights
from London to H o n g K o n g are over
Â£300. Y o u can fly directly to Beijing a
little cheaper.
I took the Trans-Siberian railway from
Moscow to Beijing, (see article 'Bottom
Bunk to Beijing', Felix 896, 1 M a r c h
1991). After a week in Beijing of chasing
money-changers and black market train
tickets, I gave up and flew to Xian, home
of the Terracotta A r m y .
A n unforgettable hard-seat train journey
took me to Chengdu, w h i c h I used as a
base for excursions to Leshan and E m e i
Shan. A memorable bus journey of
unpredictable length provides a unique
insight into roadside village life.
The bone-shaking bus w i t h broken
windows and bald tyres was resting in
bay four. 'A better way to travel' was
tattooed ominously in blood red paint
along the battered body work. I joined
the swarm of peasants round the m u d
