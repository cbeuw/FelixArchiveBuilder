ICU Islamic society present some of their views about the UN and the USA.
Puppets or Patrons? OPINION
The war in the Gulf has affected us all,
whether it be from the rising price of
petrol, the loss of life, or the economic
and ecological consequences. Now that a
cease-fire has taken place, w e should
examine the issue for w h i c h this war was
fought objectively and take a stand.
A l l western politicians have adopted an
uncompromising stance against Saddam
Hussein and Iraq. The U N has issued 12
resolutions condemning the action of the
Iraqi army since 2.8.90. W e have been
led to the war by the standoff between
the West and Iraq over Kuwait. There is
an alternative view, namely Islam.
Historically the region of land w h i c h now
contains 46 different muslim countries,
was united w i t h no false borders under a
commonly implemented system which
above all guaranteed tranquility and
security for all who lived under it, muslim
and non-muslim alike.
With the intellectual decline of the
inhabitants of the Islamic state, the
orientalists succeeded in dividing the state
with the seeds of nationalism, and over a
period of a hundred years, eventually
destroyed it in 1924 under Mustafa Kamal
Ataturk. After that Britain and France
carved up muslim land into small
insignificant states in accordance with the
Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916. F r o m
there onwards the region has been used
by various nations to initiate conflicts of
political and economic gains.
With regards to the latest problem in
the area, the A m e r i c a n and indeed British
objectives have been clear as far back as
1958.
'...at all costs these oil-fields must be
kept in western lands. The immediate
problem is whether it is good tactics to
occupy Kuwait against the wishes of the
ruling family' Selwyn L l o y d (British
Foreign Secretary) 1958.
A s far back as the 1970s, A m e r i c a has
openly stated that any m o v e against her
oil interest w o u l d be met with force, even
in using the countries of the region to
execute military operations against a
dissenting nation. Even Margaret
Thatcher admitted that the US troops
were on the w a y before being invited by
Saudi Arabia. Talk of establishing a
permanent presence in the region of
A m e r i c a n and U N 'peacekeepers' is
merely an excuse to permanently police
the region on America's terms. If concern
for aggression is the motive for the
A m e r i c a n response, w h y was the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1982 'rewarded'
with a so-called security zone on
Lebanese soil? If concern for small nation
sovereignty in the face of aggression is
the motive w h y did the w o r l d community
stand still when the US invaded Panama
late in 1989 killing up to 7,000 inocent
civilians in the process? W h y US
hegemony in Grenada, Nicaragua, Tripoli
in 1986, or as recently as 1990 in the
Philippines? Britain is not blameless; do
we not remember that Britain supported
the US veto of the U N Security council
resolution condemning US action in
Panama, support w h i c h has been given
on many other occasions.
To believe that international law and
the U N is impartial and just, is naive.
Since 1970, 67 U N resolutions have been
vetoed by A m e r i c a because it didn't
comply with her interest in the regions
concerned.
Surely it stands to reason if international
law is to be impartial and just, then it
should logically apply in all circumstances
whether it is pro or anti, any of the five
permanent members. However the reality
is quite different, as is clear to see.
Furthermore, despite all the 'bravado' of
defending democracy and freedom the
U N itself is an un-democratic institution
where O N L Y five states have the right to
veto!! It is nothing more than a
dictatorship of five permanent members,
'a democracy of dictatorship'.
W h e n South Africa invaded Namibia, no
military force was sent to liberate
We have no eternal
allies, we have no
eternal enemies, our
interests are eternal
and perpetual' Lord
Palmer ston 1848.
Namibia from illegal occupation, no
bombing missions were sent over
Johannesburg to impose U N resolutions.
O n the contrary, A m e r i c a n officials called
for 'quiet diplomacy' w h i c h lasted twenty
years.
'One million people killed, over 6 billion
dollars damage caused b y South Africa's
aggression against Namibia and its
neighbours.' (UN Economic Commission
on Africa.)
Eventually South Africa agreed for a
partial withdrawal on the condition that
this was linked to a partial withdrawal by
Cuban forces. So m u c h for non-linkage
and not rewarding the aggressor.
The constant manipulation of public
opinion in the media is perverting an
objective understanding of the w o r l d
situation. The daily bombardment by the
media and politicians alike of 'no linkage!'
or 'Saddam's brutality' and the apparent
acceptance by the masses in the west
indicates an extremely shallow mentality.
If they are so concerned then what
happened to the barrage of in-depth
Panorama programmes on 'Saddam's
psychology'. Didn't they have the
relevant information three years ago
when he gassed 5,000 people in Halabja,
or was it not in their interest?
Furthermore, w h y did Britain renew
credits to Iraq worth millions a few days
after the incident when Amnesty
International released the news?
W h y did A m e r i c a , Britain, Israel,
Germany, and France break the
international weapons embargo against
Iraq and Iran to supply them with
weapons to kill each other?
What happened to all this sweet talk of
'human values'? Was it not A m e r i c a in
1975 w h o sanctioned the invasion of East
Timor by Indonesia resulting in the mass
genocide of 200,000 people (reported by
Amnesty International). Commenting on
this, the then US ambassador to the U N
(1975), a Daniel Patrick M o y n i h a n wrote
in his memoirs:
'The US wished things to turn out as
they did and w o r k e d to bring this about'
The U N is but a useful tool of its
permanent members. If w e examine its
origins we find that the so-called
international law was established back in
1761 in response to the Islamic law
(Sharia) of the Islamic state of the time.
The international law w h i c h formed the
basis for the League of Nations and then
the U N had its roots in Christian family
law, and was pieced together in Prussia
(today Germany). International law is
nothing more than a response to a
particular situation a few hundred years
ago. It has no rational basis, unlike
Islamic law.
Do we believe that the cause of human
rights in the world are enhanced by
placing a boycott against 17 million
people in Iraq and Kuwait? Whatever
happened to the right for food and
clothing?
The policy of Britain and A m e r i c a is to
build up their political agents with
equipment to be used against the people,
and who will serve their interest.
Douglas H u r d said last November: 'the
attack on Kuwait is an attack on the new
world order'. In response, James Baker
said: 'No one will be allowed to tamper
with the new w o r l d order, a n d we are
determined to use force against that.'
Isn't it time that y o u too spent some
time to study the alternatives to
America's new world order. W h y are the
commentators so afraid of increasing
Islamic awareness among the people of
the region? W h y does A m e r i c a literally
jump at the opportunity to discipline the
errant puppet? A n d most telling of a l l -
w h y do you not question the real motives
behind the most destructive attack upon
the country in the history of mankind?
Can you really believe in and endorse a
way of life built solely upon economic
benefit?
