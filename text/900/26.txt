Present problems
Dear Andy,
After the appaling behaviour by certain
members and ex-members of college at
the ents gig on Friday night I felt it was
about time something was said.
Recently Ents Events have become
harder and harder to run, due to certain
people deeming themselves eligible to
gain free entry to an event, in their
pursuit of alcohol.
People such as certain members of
Mines, Links, Rugby Club, and other very
drunk individuals coming over from
Southside Bar, seem disinterested in
having a good time by watching bands
and dancing in a disco, and would rather
drink till they're sick and then look for a
fight. Maybe this is I.C. mentality -
male:female ratio creating a different
atmosphere than at other universities -
but this is quite disturbing. Every time
there is an Ents Event these people are
determined to get in without paying. Not
only is this unfair to the people who have
paid, but, in recent weeks, it has also
been unnecessary as the event has been
free - or reduced entry price - earlier
in the evening, for entertainment which is
exeptionally good value anyway.
My belief is that the problem lies with
individuals believing it is 'hard' or
'macho' to try to get in free each week.
Bollocks.
The people you are harming are
ultimately yourselves. If the Ents
Commitee refuse to put up with the
verbal and physical abuse thrown at them
every week, it is likely that they will stop
volunteering to help run events -
something that is done for enjoyment
supposedly. This is becoming quite likely.
If this is the case then Ents Events will
stop and, probably more importantly to
"he Alcohol-Worshippping Morons out
there, no more bar extensions. Is it too
much to ask that the Ents Commitee be
allowed to enjoy an event too?
In addition, the event on Friday was
sold-out. When an event reaches full
capacity - a figure decided before the
event, based on safe fire limits - then
the person responsible for the event (i.e.
me) has to ensure no more people are
allowed into the building/event. The
limits are not negotiable, and, once the
maximum no. of tickets has been sold,
no-one else gets in, even if people leave,
as these people can return during the
event. Hopefully now, the stupid people
who caused trouble on Friday night will
understand this, and if they want to, will
get to the event earlier.
There are a few options to alleviate the
problem, including refusing admission
after 11pm and stopping bar extensions.
The options will have been discussed by
the time you read this.
I feel sorry for the majority of people
who come to events, don't cause any
trouble and really enjoy themselves. It is
unfair that their entertainment is spoiled
by the minority of pissed-up people who
have such a problem with the egos that
they need to cause as much trouble as
possible on the door.
These people are Sad Bastards and
make I.C. what it is. The violent tactics
employed by certain individuals should
not be allowed to continue. It should be
stopped now, before it's too late.
Thanks to everyone who had a good
time on Friday and didn't cause hassle.
Remember to bring your Union Cards this
Friday. Many thanks to all those who
helped out.
BJ (Ents Chairman)
on behalf of the entire Ents Commitee
Useless whinging
Dear Sir,
As a result of recent mental illness I
feel almost obliged to defer the second
year of my mathematics degree.
In the course of beginning to resolve
my, considerable, debts, I decided (finally)
to obtain my ICU and ULU cards, to
which I am entitled.
As a registered student of IC Mr B
Turner cannot in law prevent me from
obtaining these cards (which are, as we
know, very useful).
I have been to registry and confirmed
the facts of the matter and believe you
me; the next time I personally hear that
Mr Turner has been so shoddy in his
behaviour to an IC student, I will, through
ULU do my best to get that bureaucrat
dropped on from a considerable height.
Name withheld by request.
Just to clear this up: Having defered
your second year you are no longer a
registered student, thus you are not
entitled to your ICU and ULU cards.
Registry told you that ypu were as
they had not, at that time, been
informed of your withdrawal. When
you approached Mr Turner he offered
to give you the cards, valid up until
the date at which you were going to
withdraw, but you refused his offer.
There are a lot of things wrong with
this Union, but they aren't helped by
pointless whinging.
