main structures laboratory of the
campus, where the lecturers were
proud to show us the main feature,
a very impressive load cell imported
directly from Japan. This was the
main tool to analyse the strength of
various structural members, made of
predominantly of concrete.
Following the morning’s university
visit and free lunch period, the group
then met up again to participate in
the walking tour of Bucharest. For
logistical reasons, we were once again
split into two groups, but both guides
were incredibly cultured and offered
as a very interesting tour around the
major Bucharest landmarks, whilst
filling us in on Romanian history.
This provided great insight into a city
and country that we did not know
much about. Romania has always
been a buffer zone between various
empires until the 19th
century when
it gained its independence. The 20th
century proved very difficult for the
country however, between World
War II and their years part of the
Soviet/Eastern block throughout the
Cold War. The communist regime
of Ceaușescu in the late 20th
century
pushed the country into poverty.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union
and the Communist Party in 1991
Romania has been trying to rebuild
its economy and reaffirm its identity
as a country with a long history and
important heritage.
The main conclusion of this
fascinating walking tour was that
Bucharest is a very surprising city
of contrasts both culturally and
architecturally, with a mix of newly
built ‘16th
century Parisian’-style
buildings, closed down buildings in
ruins and flamboyant landmarks
from Ceaușescu’s rule and the
revolution, such as the Palace of
Parliament and the controversial
‘Potato on a stick’. This walking tour
provided a great end to a busy and
insightful day, which was brought
to a close with further discovery of
the Bucharest nightlife and more
bonding between years.
Day 3
Day 3 started off with the group split
in two. Whilst one of the groups
headed west in the city to a large
metro project site, the other half
headed to the north of the city to the
site of Bucharest One. The first site
gave the students the opportunity to
see first-hand what a tunnel boring
machine (TBM) looks like and the full
size of them.
The tour started with a trip down
two levels in the station to see the
TBM and the tunnel. The tunnel had
just been completed and they were
at the stage of shotcreting the walls
of the tunnels to prevent flooding
within the station. The site was a
great chance for the student to see
how complex the engineering can
become when working in a location
with a high groundwater table. It
was a topical site visit considering
the amount of tunnelling that is
currently going on in London with
Crossrail.
The Bucharest One site contrasted
the metro project and allowed the
students to see how buildings are
constructed in near proximity and on
top of tube lines. It was fascinating to
see the site having had the talk on it
at the Technical University the day
before. On completion, the office
building will be the second tallest
building in Romania. Students were
first given a short presentation by the
site manager and it was impressive
to see that they were, unusually,
ahead of schedule! From the site
office, the students were then led
around the site, first going down
into the basement levels and then up
to the sixth floor from where there
was a surprisingly good view of the
surrounding area. Some particularly
interesting features of the site were
the methods that were incorporated
to account for the location of the
building over the metro lines. Large
movement joints and uncoupling of
the walls were observed and it was
great for the students to see things
that they have learnt at university put
into practice.
After lunch the whole group went to
the Romanian Palace of Parliament
for a group tour of the magnificent
yet controversial building. Even with
the knowledge that it is the second
largest building in the world, the
group was overwhelmed by the sheer
size of it in person and the space
inside. It was a fascinating tour led
by a very enthusiastic tour guide, and
enabled the students to learn even
more about the history of Bucharest
and the communist leader Nicolae
Ceaușescu. The dictator ordered the
construction of this building as a
monument to his communist rule,
but never saw it finished as it was
completed in 1994, three years after
his decapitation. This impressive
and imposing building, which was
valued at $4 billion at the time
of its construction, is extremely
controversial, as the marble and
lavish ornamentation does not reflect
the situation of poverty the entire
country was in during the late 1980s.
The sheer size of the Palace and the
visiting restrictions meant that we
were only able to visit 5% of the
building, but the group was allowed to
go out onto the balcony of the palace
from where they enjoyed a fantastic
view of the city.
Day 4
For the final full day in Bucharest
the students were given a free and
relaxing day with nothing planned
and were allowed to visit the different
attractions as they liked. One of
the main activities of the day was
visiting the North of Bucharest,
which had a number of parks and
green areas for the students to
enjoy a picnic and make the most
of the weather. This was also the
location of the ‘Romanian Arc de
Triomphe’, a smaller version of the
famous Parisian landmark, depicting
Bucharest once again as the ‘Little
Paris’. The freedom and flexibility
of the day was received with positive
feedback as each individual was able
to do what they liked without being
confined to a group of 70.
The students were able to experience
the broad attractions that Bucharest
had to offer according to their likes
and dislikes. In the evening there
was a group meal that had been
planned in advance at the City Grill
Restaurant. The restaurant was highly
accommodating and the food and
atmosphere was greatly enjoyed by
all. It was a fantastic opportunity
for the students to share the week’s
experiences and to sample the local
cuisine one last time.
Day 5
Sadly, the final day of the tour came
about and the group made their way
to Bucharest Airport via coach for the
bittersweet voyage back to London.
The coach journey provided safe
and easy transportation and gave
the students a chance to reflect as we
drove past the sites one last time.
The CivSoc International Tour
2015 was a highly successful event
and it achieved above and beyond
the goals set out by the committee.
There were no serious issues, and
everything went according to plan
and, most impressively, we stayed
in budget! The tour provided the
students with a perfect balance
between an educational and relaxing
week away. Not only did the Tour
achieve its main goals for the event
allowing students to experience Civil
Engineering in a foreign country,
the students were also given the
educational experience of history,
culture and technical knowledge.
The social aspect of the tour has
enabled the students from all years
to come together and form great
friendships. The feedback received
from the participants was incredibly
positive and it has been seen since
that there is more integration
within the years and excitement
for other upcoming CivSoc events.
The great success of this year’s tour
has certainly built excitement and
enthusiasm for Civsoc International
Tour 2016 and whatever it may hold.
CivSoc Tour 2015 would not
have been able to happen and most
certainly not such a success without
the generous support from our
partners. At this point I would like
to thank BP, IC Union, the OC Trust
(CGCA), CCC, Vinci Construction and
the Civil Engineering Department of
Imperial College London. Thank you
so much on behalf of all the students
and I hope we can continue this
collaboration in the future!
