Comment: Imperial needs to do more
Mental health is the great un-
tackled health problem in the UK.
In a year 1 in 4 adults will
experience a mental health
problem and suicide is the biggest
killer of men under the age of 35.
This week’s results from the
‘Mentality’campaign show that
Imperial is no exception.Of those
who completed the survey,over
82% of respondents experienced
anxiety at least once a term and at
72% experienced insomnia.24%
of students experienced suicidal
thoughts at least once a term.
These statistics are shocking to
any compassionate observer.
We live in an age of advanced
medical care,where child mortality
rates are at record lows and
where our life expectancy is only
continuing the grow and yet,we
cannot tackle these fundamental
problems that make life a misery
for so many.
You’re at a higher risk of a mental
health problem if you’re young,or if
you are in a high pressure situation.
Welcome to Imperial College,
which is full of young people,often
away from home for the first time
and often under pressure to meet a
deadline.
There is no doubt to me that a
university has a duty of care to its
students.
As university is such a huge part
of a students’life and the very
nature of the degree can affect your
health–it’s right for Imperial to do
what it reasonably can to help.
And it does; for example it funds
a counselling service,often the
first port of call for students,and it
also provides funds to the health
centre so that it is able to cater for
all Imperial students,not just those
living close to campus as well as
working with the GPs in the health
centre so that they understand
Imperial’s systems and how best to
help a current student effectively
This funding is however,
under threat.A review recently
recommended that students
should seek help from their local
GPs paving the way for Imperial to
retract funding.
This would have a major impact
on student wellbeing.Whilst the
health centre is not perfect,it is
significantly better at dealing with
students’problems than other GP
surgeries in London.
Their GPs regularly meet with
college staff,sit on committees,
meet with senior tutors and work
with the counselling service
directly.
The health services at Imperial
need all the funding they can get
at the moment.Students are being
denied the vital help they need
because of months long waiting
lists,which makes it more and more
likely they have to take time out of
their course,their results suffer
and most importantly,their health
deteriorates further.
There are effective medical
treatments for the vast majority of
mental health problems.
No one should have to live with
one forever,and no one should feel
defined by it.In an ideal world,
the NHS would provide all the
treatment and help we could need,
but this isn’t that ideal world.
Imperial needs to support
students to the best it can,it’s
in College’s own interest to have
healthy students and it needs
to continue to effectively fund
organisations that help that.

Mentality: We need to learn to address
stress and realise we are all in this together
Mentality was started as
a campaign this year,
building on the success
The campaign was run by a group
of students and lead by Bethany
Davison, a second year physics
student.
They secured £400 in funding from
Imperial College Union to spend on
publicity and events promoting the
survey and mental health awareness,
and with Union staff support put
together their survey to finally
quantify the mental health issues
Imperial students face, sometimes on
a daily basis.
Chris Kaye, Deputy President
(Welfare), said about Mentality: “I’m
delighted that a student-let campaign
funded by Community & Welfare
Board has been able to present
such important data at the Welfare
Seminar.
“It is a great success for Mentality
and student-led campaigns as a
whole.”
Beth spoke to Felix about what
spurred her on to start the campaign.
Beth
described how she herself suffered
from depression in her first year at
Imperial, and although she said he
experiences with Imperial welfare
provisions were wholly positive, she
still felt incredibly lonely.
“I got better and returned to
Imperial adamant that no student
should feel the same loneliness that
I felt,” said Beth. “The initial aims of
Mentality were to increase awareness
of mental health and the services at
Imperial, reduce the stigma of mental
health and to support students.
“As things started to progress, it
became clear that my own positive
experiences were not the norm. I
heard too many stories where the
support given was just not good
enough or non-existent.”
Beth said it was then they released
they needed to call for improvements,
one of the main aims behind the
survey results.
Explained Beth: “I don’t want
students and staff to think that
the point of the survey report is to
say ‘Look at how bad Imperial is,
everyone here is really stressed. It’s a
terrible place to be!’
Yes, some of the statistics are pretty
shocking and the personal stories
paint a very grim picture and we don’t
want to shy away from that.
However, I also want people to
look at the results and use them
to challenge their own ideas and
preconceptions about mental health,
and to think a bit deeper about the

reasons behind these results and what
they can do to improve the situation.”
Beth uses the example of stress
surrounding exams and revision,
something that 77% of the
respondents of the survey had
experienced at one point during their
time at Imperial. She explains that
the answer isn’t to simply get rid of
exams, coursework or deadlines, but
to teach students to manage stress
and academic pressures in a healthy
and positive way.
“To do this we could have
departmental talks about dealing
with stress, increase publicity for
workshops run by the Counselling
Service and do more to dispel some
of the false rumours and beliefs that
students have about exams and the
way they’re moderated.”
“These are small changes which
could make a difference to lots of
students.”
Beth also explained that we all
need to work together to improve
the mental wellbeing of students and
staff at Imperial.
Said Beth: “We all need to be
involved, whether it’s as a student,
taking the time to ask a friend how
they really are or as a senior staff
member in College, committing to
expanding the counselling service.
“I want this report to be a positive
thing and to inspire change.”
“I heard
too many
stories
where the
support
given
was just
not good
enough
or non-
existent.”
“I want
this report
to be a
positive
thing and
to inspire
change.”
IC Health centre has a
long waiting list and you
have to be refered if you
are ill when there is an
appointment.
My personal tutor was
amazing. He talked
to me and we decided
together that I would
take an interruption to
studies and then helped
me get into the swing
of things when I came
back.
If you miss an
appointment with your
GP they don’t check up on
you despite it being about
a mental illness; the fact
that you don’t turn up
should raise a red flag.
I felt like I may have
intruded on the time of
my tutor.
The IC health centre
was sympathetic to my
underlying medical
condition that was
causing my poor medical
state and at that point
helped me to quickly
find a solution.
Hall warden belittled
my illness when I
went to seek help for
problems I was having
with my roommate that
were leaving me sleep
deprived and depressed.
GP was very
understanding and
did not belittle me in
any way. I felt I was
taken seriously and was
directed immediately to
current support services.
My personal tutor provided
clear advice and good
support, and counselling
felt safe.
