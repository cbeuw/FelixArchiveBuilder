Bikes
• Use a quality lock
not a cheap cable lock.The
security office can provide a
discounted A graded D lock
for £30.They have been in use
since 2011 and to date not one
has ever been cut off.
• Use the secure bike
storage areas.Just get your
cycle property marked and
registered online,then swipe
access will be given to staff or
students to use the facilities.
For advice contact the
security office in room 155
Sherfield.
• When securing your
bike,make sure the frame is
secured,not just the quick
release wheels that only
assist thieves.
• Any quick release
items such as saddles,
lights and wheels,consider
removing them and taking
them with you or using
additional locks to secure
them.
• Do not allow people
to tail gate you into secure
areas.The only people that
should be entering will have
swipe access.
Being polite and holding
doors open is nice but not at
the expense of someone’s
£1500 bike.
• Take and retain a
digital photo of your bike and
record bike serial numbers to
aid recovery if stolen.
• If you see someone
acting suspiciously,report it
to security immediately.
Laptops and Tablets
• Keep your communal
areas,office spaces and halls
of residence as secure as
possible,do not allow people
to tailgate you into controlled
areas.
• Challenge suspicious
persons or call security to do
so,better safe than sorry.
• Do not leave items
unattended in communal
areas,even for short periods.
• Lock all IT equipment
away in secure areas
overnight or when leaving
unattended.
• Do not leave doors
propped open and be aware
burglars do climb so items
left next to open windows
even when not on the ground
floor are at risk.
• Get items property
marked,record serial
numbers and any facts that
could aid identification if
stolen.
• Ensure relevant
tracking software is installed
and enabled on your device
where available.
• Use laptop security
cables with items in your
work stations.
“All
victims will
be treated
with
dignity and
respect."
My name is Nigel Ward,
and on 30th
March 2015 I
was employed by Imperial
College as the Senior Security Officer,
Crime. My role is to investigate
all crime, deliver a gold standard
of victim care, and implement
prevention tactics and strategies
to reduce crime and the number of
victims. What I bring to this role
comes from serving 30 years in the
Metropolitan Police service from
which I retired this February.
What is exceptionally important to
me is the way that victims of crime
are treated. As a result I have created
a new Victim Charter; this ensures
all victims will be treated with
dignity, respect and understanding.
Communications will be open,
honest, and transparent and victims
will be treated in line with their
needs and wishes rather than treating
everyone the same. The charter
also assures that no matter what
the severity of a crime, all victims
are fully supported and advised
from cradle to grave throughout
investigations.
The security teams, as well as
myself, are also very keen to support
any actions or events being organised
by the student Union or assist in
organising event. Areas such as
personal safety/security talks and
bike/property marking events helping
to ensure our students have a safe and
enjoyable college life.
Since starting, the two main crimes
that have been all too apparent,
impacting the most and creating
victims of crime are theft of pedal
by tailgating people in and then out
with stolen bikes and scaling fencing.
Thieves have been captured on CCTV
walking onto the campus on foot
dressed in full cycling gear, helmets,
glasses, pollution masks and lycra
shorts and then minute’s later riding
out again on stolen bikes.
The many laptops that have been
taken have, mainly, been stolen
when left unattended in insecure
areas such as open plan offices,
communal areas in halls of residence,
unlocked classrooms, and eating
establishments. Suspects have,
again, managed to enter secure areas
through tailgating and unfortunately
thieves will target the College campus
as they see it as an easy target where
electronics are left unattended. The
example I usually give is you would
not leave £1500 cash sitting on a table
in an office or communal area and
expect it to stay there while you go
get a coffee, so then why do it with
a computer, phone, or tablet worth
similar amounts of money.
"You
wouldn’t
leave £1500
cash sitting
on a table."
cycles and theft of laptops. In the
last six weeks 13 Laptops and 6 bikes
have been stolen. In total the value
of the items stolen is approximately
£15,000 and some of the crimes were
absolutely preventable.
Investigation findings
Bicycles on the whole have been
stolen by professional thieves
targeting bike storage areas and
cutting off inferior security devices
such as cable locks. Suspects have
managed to enter secure bike sheds
