Welfare officer and
wardens great to chat
with and just have
someone to listen, not
necessarily analysing
everything I say, just
being there for me.
Student Counselling
was extremely difficult
in the beginning, but
the counsellor allowed
me to take my time,
and helped me greatly
in clearing my mind.
I was under the
impression that we had
to ‘deal with it ourselves.’
My dept head talked
about only coming to
see him in extenuating
circumstances.
I asked for a
counselling
appointment, but the
first available is in
months and meanwhile
I am left alone.
One Imperial GP told me
to “stop being silly” when
I had self harmed severely
and taken an overdose...
it shouldn’t be a lottery
whether you’re going to
get good care.
My personal tutor,
although a good tutor,
had no advice to offer and
seemed uncomfortable
and out of his depth when
I said I was struggling.
Councelling felt like
they were working
against a ticking clock
the entire time because
they don’t have enough
time/staff for students,
which I guess is not their
fault.
I just needed an outlet to
talk and give me a boost.
I wish I had contacted
someone sooner.
Imperial students twice as likely to be
stressed than national average
Asimilar survey was ran by the
National Union of Students
(NUS) back in 2013, which
surveyed around 1200 students
across the country via an online
questionnaire.
The NUS found that 10% of
students had already been diagnosed
with a mental health problem, 2%
were currently seeking a diagnosis
and a further 8% believed they had a
mental health problem but were not
seeking diagnosis at the time.
The Mentality report however
found that 20% of respondents
said they had or still have a mental
health condition. 67% of those who
responded said they had never been
diagnosed with a mental health
problem at all, compared to 62% of
Imperial students who said they did
not have a mental health condition.
When asked what symptoms of
mental distress students may have
experienced at least once during
their studies, 55% had said they had
experienced anxiety and 49% of those
who had responded had said they had
felt a “depressed feeling.”
However, the NUS survey found
that only 14% of students have had
thoughts of self-harm, and 13% have
harboured suicidal thoughts during
the time they have spent at their place
of study.
These findings were lower than
those from the Mentality survey;
35% of those that responded to
the Imperial survey said they had
experienced suicidal thoughts at
least once a year, whilst 36% of the
same sample reported experiencing
thoughts of self-harm over the same
time period.
Not only that, but the Mentality
survey results suggested that Imperial
students suffer from stress more
often than students from other
universities: only 31% of students

“Imperial
students
suffer from
stress more
often than
students
from other
universities”
“1 in 4
people will
experience
some kind
of mental
health
problem
over the
course of a
year”
who responded to the NUS survey
said they experienced stress at least
once a week, compared to 69.5% of
Imperial students who said the same.
The NUS survey found that 26% of
those experiencing mental distress
didn’t tell anyone about their
feelings, a similar percentage to those
at Imperial who also didn’t enclose
their feelings with anyone.
Both the NUS survey and the
Mentality survey found that students
are reluctant to talk to personal
tutors or other academic members
of staff; out of the Imperial students
who stated that they were suffering
from mental distress, only 13%
discussed their concerns with their
personal tutor, whilst nationally, the
NUS survey found that only 14% of
students did the same.
That’s not to say students
nationally are not aware of some of
the services available; the NUS found
that 79% of students acknowledge
that their GP or Doctor can provide
advice or support services.
However, only 58% were aware that
their place of study can help, whilst a
smaller portion of only 35% of those
asked were aware that their Student
Union could offer advice and support.
76% of Imperial students said in
their Mentality survey response that
they are aware that their personal
tutor can provide support, and 43%
said they knew they could approach
their Students’ Union Welfare
Officer.
So how do we compare nationally?
According to the Mental Health
Foundation, 1 in 4 people will
experience some kind of mental
health problem over the course of
a year, with anxiety and depression
coming top as the most common
mental disorders.
The World Health Organisation
(WHO) has forecast that by 2020,
depression will be the second leading
contributor to the global burden of
disease.

Where you can find support at Imperial
Many students go to their personal
tutors first when experiencing
difficulties coping with stress and
other mental health problems.
The Union’s Advice Centre can also
provide impartial advice when you
feel your department can’t help.
Imperial Health Centre offers
a range of support including
referrals,and they have a lot of
experience with mental health
issues among students.
Your local GP will be able to provide
the same service.
Through the Counselling Service
students can access trained
professionals to help talk through
their problems.
