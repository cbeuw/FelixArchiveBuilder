Impetus back for Summer Term!
Impetus is your chance to play one of
seven Impetus sports in an organised
environment but without the commitment
of competitive sport. We’ll sort out the
where, when and who – all you have to
do is turn up when you can. If you like
sport but don’t have the time or desire
to play competitively for a club or team,
Impetus may be just the thing for you. We
provide all the equipment for the session
and even throw in professional coaching
to help you get the most out of it!
You can sign up in person at Ethos,
where you will be asked to complete a
registration card. You will be then issued
a membership card and then you are able
to attend any of the Impetus sessions
absolutely free! You see the full summer
timetable at
imperialcollegeunion.org/news
If you have any questions about the
Impetus scheme or would like more
information, please email
