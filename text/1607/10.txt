Anti-Austerity Protests take place in
Central London
Anti-austerity protests
took place in London
on Wednesday, with
demonstrators taking to the streets
alongside the Queen’s Speech in the
newly elected Parliament.
Organised by the People’s
Assembly, the march covered large
sections of central London, moving
from outside Downing Street at
around 5.00pm.
The march then continued for
several hours, with protests spreading
across the capital before once again
coming together outside Downing
Street.
The national secretary of the
People’s Assembly claimed 2000
demonstrators were present for this
main part of the protest outside
Whitehall.
There were some clashes between
police and protestors, with at least
five protestors being arrested during
the day. Two were arrested over
‘imminent breach of the peace’, while
another was arrested on suspicion
of violent disorder during previous
protests.
The arrests were not representative
of the protest as a whole, however.
One protestor was Navid Nabijou, an
Imperial student, who told Felix that
“the level of support we received from
bystanders was incredible. It was a
bittersweet reminder that we live in
a city which forcefully rejected the
Tories at the election.”
Labour hold 45 of the
Parliamentary seats in London, with
the Conservatives on 27 and the
Liberal Democracts on 1.
Nabijou describes the protest’s
“palpable sense of anger and
injustice… but also a feeling of hope,
a determination not to sink into
despair.
“Towards the end of the march a
street party atmosphere developed,
with ‘Dancing Queen’ playing on
loudspeaker[s] and multi-coloured
balloons floating above the crowd.”
The protests quickly took
to Twitter, with the hashtag
#FucktheTories the first to surface,
with #antiausterity soon following.
Most participants used the platform
to post updates on the status of the
protests, with one noting that they
were “now outside Downing St having
a dance. Choice of music: ABBA.
#FucktheTories”
There was also debate on Twitter
over how people felt about the
protests, with opinion proving
divided.
One Twitter commentator
remarked, “last time the braying mob
tried to subvert democracy, Thatcher
crushed them. Democracy will always
win against #antiausterity thuggery,”
while another tweeted that “Labour
should be backing the #antiausterity
protest in London. As a party we need
to return to the left and represent
working class people.”
Several tweets also referred to the
group of protestors who encountered
UKIP MP Douglas Carswell outside
St James’ Park. The crowd jeered
and swarmed Mr Carswell, shouting
“racist, racist.” The police soon
intervened, escorting him to a police
van to allow him to escape.
Said one Twitter commentator:
“Protestors have found UKIP MP
Douglas Carswell and they’re not
happy with him #FucktheTories.”
The People’s Assembly have
confirmed they are planning further
protests, scheduled to take place on
the 20th
June.

Thoughts of a
protestor
We assembled at around five
o’clock outside Downing Street,
and began to march.For three
hours we marched,and though
physically exhausted by the end
of it,our high spirits kept us
going.
The level of support we received
from bystanders was incredible.
It was a bittersweet reminder
that we live in a city which
forcefully rejected the Tories at
the election.
There was a palpable sense of
anger and injustice,with loud
chanting along the whole route.
At one point we assembled in
Trafalgar Square and people
were invited to share their own
experiences of austerity.
But beyond this there was also a
feeling of hope,a determination
not to sink into despair.Towards
the end of the march a street
party atmosphere developed,
with“Dancing Queen”playing on
loudspeaker and multi-coloured
balloons floating above the
crowd.
The vast majority of economists
now agree that reducing
spending in a time of crisis
only serves to depress growth
and stifle the recovery.The
experience of various post-crisis
economies now provides ample
evidence for this,and it goes
some way to explaining why the
Government hasn’t even come
close to meeting the deficit
reduction targets it set in 2010.
In reality,these cuts are
ideological.Cameron and his
inner circle have more or less
admitted this,repeatedly stating
over the last couple of years that
even when they reach a budget
surplus they will not be reversing
their cuts to public services.
They want to take us back to a
level of spending not seen for
almost a century.All of this is
passed off as“common sense”
or“tough choices”,when really
it is about nothing more than
shifting wealth from the poorest
in society to the richest.
Protest can make a difference.
In 1990,the movement of mass
protest and civil disobedience
against the Poll Tax led to the
charge being repealed and
Margaret Thatcher’s resignation
as Prime Minister.
On the 20th
June tens of
thousands will join forces in
the heart of London to send a
message: we will not put up with
these lies any longer.I hope to
see you there.
