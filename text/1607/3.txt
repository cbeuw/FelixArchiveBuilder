Imperial Scientists create
model of extinct lung parasite
A3D model of a 425 million
year old fossil of a sea creature
has allowed researchers to
obtain the first examples of Invavita
piratica (invading pirate) an ancient
ancestor of a lung parasite called
Tung Worm, sometimes found in
humans.
The research team from the
University of Leicester including
Imperial’s Dr Mark Sutton,
Department of Earth Sciences and
Engineering, produced the model and
are using it to gain a much better idea
of how Tung Worm has evolved. This
specimen is the first adult example of
the parasite to be found.
Previously only larvae have been
found in rocks from 500 million
years ago. This meant that there was
on evidence about the life of the adult
parasite. The discovery of the adult
parasite living on the outside of a sea
creature indicates that the species has
undergone drastic changes.
The research has been reported
Ain Shams University in Cairo
has had to cancel exams after
fears of protests by students
following the controversial death of
Engineering student Islam Salah Al-
Din Atitu.
Atitu’s body was found on a desert
road hours after he was called out of
an exam by University staff at the
request of an unidentified individual
who is said to have escorted Atitu
off-campus.
Egypt’s Interior Ministry has
said that Atitu was killed during a
chase with Security Forces and that
he was involved in the murder of
Egypt’s Homeland Security Colonel
Wael Tahoon in April. Claims of
his involvement in the killing have
attracted criticism, with the Student’s
Union calling them “a story falsely
and deceitfully fabricated”.
The University has reportedly
called in security forces to its
campus to deal with student riots,
whilst the Student’s Union denies
in Current Biology, with Dr Sutton
reporting: “Fossils like this can
genuinely cast light on things that
would be otherwise fundamentally
unknowable… we now have a much
better idea of the evolutionary
pathway this parasite took from
external to internal.”
any wrongdoing and has called on
the University to release evidence
surrounding Atitu’s death, with many
students resigning from the Union in
protest at the percived complicity of
the University in the violent death of
one of its students.
Reports indicate that the University
has cancelled a number of exams for
Engineering students to reduce the
likelihood of protests, with students
reporting that only those people with
exams are being allowed on campus.
This is one of a number of incidents
of violence on Egyptian university
campuses since the controversial
removal of President Morsi, leader
of the Muslim Brotherhood, by
a military government in 2013.
According to the Association for
Freedom of Thought and Expression,
an oppposition group, at least 22
students have been killed on-campus
over the last two years.
Amnesty International report that
the human rights situation in Egypt
has deteriorated rapidly, and that
freedoms of expression, association
and assembly have been severely
restricted.

Astudy conducted by a team
including a professor from
Imperial College London has
suggested that the large-scale diabetes
screening programme in India will
result in the public health system
being overwhelmed.
The programme, which aims to
screen the general population for
type two diabetes, requires those who
initially test positive to undergo a
second test to confirm the diagnosis.
The study estimates that between
158 million and 306 million people
will be asked to take the second
test. However the study goes on to
estimate that only between 26 million
and 37 million people will actually be
diagnosed with diabetes.
The study, published in PLOS
Medicine uses mathematical models
to estimate the outcome of screening
the entire population of the country,
which is about 1.25 billion. Three
types of survey-based screening
method were compared against
glucometer tests by researchers from
the UK, US and India.
The lead author on the study
was Dr Sanjay Basu, who is from
the Prevention Research Center at
Stanford University.
Dr Basu said “The tools we have
available are just not good enough
to make a programme like this
worthwhile. Rather than screening
the whole population, it would be
more beneficial to rely on symptom-
based diagnosis as many other
countries do.
“Health system resources can then
be focused on managing those we
know have diabetes, whose care at the
moment is suboptimal.”
If all 567 million people between
the ages of 25 and 65 in India
are screened for the disease, it is
estimated that between 126 and 273
million people would be given a false
positive in the first round of tests.
This many incorrect results would
create a cost of 169 million and 567
million dollars.
The Indian government has already
screened 53 million people, using
either a questionnaire or glucometer.
Those who test positive have to
undergo a blood test.
One of the authors of the study Dr
Christopher Millett, who is from the
School of Public Health at Imperial
College, said “A huge number of
people will be told they have a high
risk of diabetes and have to undergo a
second test.
“This will cause a lot of worry for
these people unnecessarily, and will
also place an enormous burden on the
health system to carry out all these
tests.”
It is believed that around 12 per
cent of Indian adults have type
two diabetes, most cases of which
remain undiagnosed. The disease
can lead to severe complications
when mismanaged, such as stroke,
cardiovascular disease, blindness,
limb amputation and kidney failure.
