This week in an attempt to
stay up for an all nighter for
your exam the next day, you
stuff a chilli down your pants;
however the capsaicin melts
your genitals off and you are
rendered as smooth as Action
Man.

This week you decide to play
international cock and ball
however your friend points
out it’s always going to be cock
because it’s so much harder to
reach for ball – like at least
70% and you decide to do a
clinical trial to establish the
most likely outcome.
This week in an attempt to
save the NHS so you can have
a guaranteed job for the rest of
your life, you get Parliament to
force all 80 year olds to move
to a pension hunger games.
You watch your own granny
use her false teeth to claw out
someone’s eyes. Heavy.
This week, Hangman writes
this horoscope:
No,hedoesn’t.Joke’sonyou.
This week you try to catch
Dwayne Johnson after the
premier of his new film with
hopes of his fathering your
children; however, the sheer
force with which he pounds
you leaves you in a wheelchair
for a few weeks.
This week you realize that as
the horoscopes writer you are
continually just reusing jokes
from Diary of a Fresher but
luckily that was like at the
beginning of the term so no
one will remember. What even
happened to that anyway?
This week, the Felix Editor
corners you in 568, plies you
with drinks and entices you
down to her office. After
stripping you naked, she
makes you wear a fake cat head
before taking pictures. It’s
all good because it’s for this
week’s Centrefold.
No, seriously. This actually
happened.
This week when you try to
sneak into the Queen’s Speech
in Parliament by hiding in
her gown you inadvertently
get a glimpse of her Ver-JJ and
are blinded for life due to the
sheer radiance of it. #YOLO
This week you sit down to
catch up on the Eurovision
contest whilst eating various
cured meats in order to feel
slightly less racist than you are;
however the sheer amount of
bratwurst you consume plays
havoc on your bowels, leading
to you shitting out entire
sausages.
This week you wonder if
Imperial’s actual motive is just
to put its students off science
altogether and after an in
depth investigative journalism
thing, you discover that Alice
Gast has been an Art Historian
from UCL all along!
This week the usual writer is
writing the horoscopes due to
the fact that last week’s were
side dish and in jokes at best.
You rejoice in the fact that
dank humour will be coming
your way and Hangman
wonders what taboo joke they
will have to edit out.
This week in an attempt to get
into hardcore revision you
buy multiple adult diapers to
prevent wasting those cheeky
seconds of revision; however
you forget to remove it when
you go to the library, leading it
to leak out when you sit down
in Wolfson.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 1/4
Sunday 25th May
Wow! It’s been a terrible month, diary. I had loads of exams, I spent almost every day in the Library, and it’s still
not finished! This week is my last week for exams, I have one on Tuesday afternoon and one on Wednesday
morning. Thanks, people who schedule exams. Way to give me time to revise between my exams, you dicks.
At least it’s a Bank Holiday on Monday, so I don’t have to worry about doing anything except revise for an extra
day.
Monday 26th May
Some of the people in my halls have finished their exams already, so they’re spending the whole day getting
drunk in the garden. I really want to join them (anything except revise!), but I don’t want to fail my exams. I can
have fun when they’re over, right?
One of the guys in the garden threw their beer can through my window and it spilt all over my notes. All the
ink’s run and it stinks of alcohol. Great. Probably wasn’t going to learn anything more, anyway, I guess. Might as
well go and join them...
Tuesday 27th May
Oh God. Oh no. No no no no. I think I missed my exam? I’m not sure. I remember going down to join the guys in
the gardens, and I think I did some shots, and then I woke up in my room just now. I’m sure my exam was meant
to be over by now. CRAP.
Wednesday 28th May
Is there any point in even going to this exam now?
