Ireland has made history as the first
country in the world to legalise
same-sex marriage by popular vote.
Over 3.2 million people were asked
whether they wanted to amend
Ireland’s constitution to allow gay
and lesbian couples to marry, in a
referendum asking the electorate to
vote “Yes” or “No” to the statement
“Marriage may be contracted in
accordance with law by two persons
without distinction as to their sex.”
The returning officer, Ríona Ní
Fhlanghaile, declared that the “Yes”
vote had won with 62.1% of the vote,
thereby enshrining gay marriage
in Ireland’s constitution. Of the 43
constituencies, just one voted against
the amendment.
The Republic of Ireland’s first
openly gay minister, The Minister for
Health Leo Varadkar, said the “Yes”
campaign had been “almost like a
social revolution”.
The Yes vote was supported by
the Government as well as all major
political parties. The final result was
announced on Saturday afternoon,
after polls closed at 10pm on Friday
with reports of “unusually high”
turnouts for a vote on amending the
constitution. The total turnout was
60.5%.
Irish citizens who are registered
were allowed to vote, and many people
returned home to Ireland to cast their
vote.
This historic referendum comes
only 22 years after homosexual
acts were decriminalised in Ireland,
and just five years since the Irish
government first enacted civil
partnership legislation, which
provided legal recognition for gay
couples.
Civil partnerships were a big step
forward, but unlike marriages they are
not protected in the constitution.
The Catholic Church, a large voice
for the No vote, has seen its influence
weaken in Ireland after child abuse
scandals and the number of those
attending church on Sundays has
“the “Yes”
vote had
won with
62.1% of the
vote”
“It is
clear the
amendment
has a strong
mandate
from the
people”
dropped off in the last two decades.
This gay marriage vote represents
the latest pillar to fall in the social
progression of Ireland – the previous
milestones including divorce in
1995. Many commentators expect a
referendum on legalising abortion to
be on the horizon.
Same-sex marriages became legal
in England and Wales in 2013, with
Scotland closely following in 2014.
Now, with the Republic of Ireland
legalising same-sex marriage in 2015,
only Northern Ireland is left as the
last place in the British isles resisting

Ireland votes “Yes” to legalising same-sex marriage
legislation.
All countries before Ireland had
legalised same-sex marriage through
the national legislature or the courts.
This Irish vote puts the number of
countries where same-sex marriage is
legal to 20, but homosexuality is still a
crime in 77 countries, and carries the
death penalty in seven.
No campaigners say they still have
questions surrounding child adoption
and surrogacy for gay couples, but
it is clear that the amendment has a
strong mandate from the people of the
Republic of Ireland.

On Wednesday the 27th
May, 20 days
after the general election, the Queen
outlined the proposed legislation of
the new government.
The speech included promises that
her government would guarantee an
EU refrendum by the end of 2017,
after a sort period of negotiation
with other European nations and the
current President of the European
Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
Also in the speech was a proposed
piece of legislation banning any
increases in income tax, VAT and
national insurance over the next five
years.
More devolution for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland have been
pledged together with “English votes
for English laws” in Westminster.
The speech included the
establishment of a “truly seven day”
NHS by 2020, and a promise to create
500 more free schools and turn failing
schools into Academies.
The Conservatives want parents
to receive 30 hours a week of free
childcare for three to four-year olds
by 2017, while freezing working age
benefits, tax credits and child benefit
for two years over the course of
parliament from 2016/2017. In this
parliament the maximum amount that
one household can claim in benefits
will drop from £26,000 to £23,000.
Many of these proposals were
promised by the Conservatives during
the election campaign, and David
Cameron can now pass proposals in
the House of Commons that he never
could in coalition with the Liberal
Democrats.
One such proposal is the plan to
scrap to scrap the Human Rights Act
and replace it with a “British Bill
of Rights.” However, Cameron has
delayed the plans to avoid potential
rebellion from his backbenchers. But
there is no doubting that it will be
pursued.
The speech did not mention the
Conservative’s plan to hold a free
Commons vote on repealing the
fox hunting ban, but environment
secretary Liz Truss has reassured the
public that it will go ahead before
2020.
This is the first Conservative
Queen’s Speech in nearly two decades,
and comes after an historic victory
for David Cameron, who is the first
British Prime Minister to be re-elected
immediately after serving a full term
with an increased popular vote share
since 1900. 2015’s results also made
Cameron the the only Prime Minister
other than Margaret Thatcher to be re-
elected immediately after a full term
with a greater share of the seats.
