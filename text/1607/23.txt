"The
Siege is
completely
unique,
even in
London’s
theatre
scene"
Apolitically engaged play in
a small theatre in South
London. There have been
many of these and, in the glorious
tradition of fringe theatre, there
will be more; but The Siege at the
Battersea Art Centre is something
entirely different, unique even in
London’s multifaceted subversive
theatre scene. The Siege is a
performance by the Freedom Theatre,
a theatre company and acting school
based on the West Bank, in Palestine.
They operate from the Jenin Refugee
camp, and they are on tour to the UK
showing their newest production, the
story of the siege of Bethlehem.
Based on interviews with the real-
life Palestinian fighters who were
present, The Siege tells the story of
how the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, considered one of the
holiest Christian sites, was in 2002
surrounded by Israeli troops for
39 days, besieging the fighters and
many citizens who had taken refuge
there, as well as the Franciscan
monks who lived in the church’s
monastery. The siege was carried out
to capture the Palestinian militants,
and was criticised internationally
as a humanitarian crisis, since the
hundreds of people within the church
lacked food, water and sanitation for
over a month. Some of the fighters
and two civilians were shot during the
siege, picked off by waiting snipers
outside.
The Siege focuses on a small handful
of Palestinian combatants, telling
their story during the entrapment.
The Israeli troops are represented
only as a constant, oppressive threat
– the bursts of machine gun fire and
the megaphone messages instructing
surrender. The throng of civilians,
also invisible, is felt as a weighty
responsibility, for whom the fighters
have to provide by finding food and
clean water. After all, as one of the
fighters says, “Revolution is like a
fish, and the people are its water” –
without their support, the revolution
is in vain. The fighters talk, while
away the time, they worry about their
loved ones, pine for good food. Their
hope and resistance slowly gives
way to doubt and despair as the food
runs short, the death toll increases,
and the situation shows no signs of
changing. What can they do, alone
and shut off from the world? Is their
resistance in vain? Are they harming
the people for whose homeland they
fight? These questions hang heavy on
them, and on the audience, broken by
moments of temporary camaraderie,
signing, and reveries of happier
times. The first-hand account of the
siege is frequently interrupted by an
imaginary flash forward, in which an
enthusiastic tour guide (the brilliant
Ahmed Tobasi) shows tourists (the
audience) round the Church of the
Nativity, pointing out the cultural,
historical and religious sites. These
scenes are light relief for the audience
from the AK47’s, shelling, and
starvation of the main story, but
also highlight the incongruity of the
church’s role as a battleground.
The Freedom Theatre’s aim is to
“generate cultural resistance”. Their
work has a deep community effect
by empowering a disenfranchised
community, training women and
young people as skilled actors,
but their message is clear: theirs
isn’t a happy-clappy alternative to
resistance, this is a cultural, non-
violent but forceful message of
Palestinian legitimacy and resistance
to the Israeli ‘occupation’. Their
presence in the UK has been opposed
by some, and the funding awarded
to the theatre company by the Arts
Council England has been criticised
as a ‘pro-Palestinian’ move, the
implication being that this play
condones terrorist activity against
the state of Israel. Knowing all this,
I was ready for an interesting but
tiring evening of angry propaganda.
What I was wholly unprepared for
is the artistic quality of The Siege.
Whatever your opinions on the
Israeli-Palestinian situation, The
Siege is a play worth seeing, with a
fantastic cast, evocative staging and
a gripping and moving story to tell.
Moments of comedy and tenderness
alleviate a play that highlights the
humanity of those involved in what
is – to us – nothing more than a
news flash. Of course the play is
biased, but it would be ridiculous to
criticise it for being so: it’s the story of
Palestinian fighters during the siege
of Bethlehem, told from their point
of view. Their fears, their hopes, their
insecurities, their pain. It speaks to an
international audiences whose views
have been polarised by more than
half a century of conflict.
The Siege doesn’t enter into this
quagmire of opposing opinions, but
presents the views of some young
men who fought for their concept
of home, family and belonging. The
deal which eventually ended the siege
was a European-brokered settlement
by which the Israeli troops lifted the
siege and the Palestinian fighters
were exiled to Gaza or a European
country where, 13 years later, they
still remain. The Siege leaves the
limbo in which they live, and the
home for which they fought for, as
a heavy question mark above the
audience. Never mind the politics, the
rights and wrongs of international
law, the legitimacy of one state
against another – what about the
actual people?
The Siege was on at the Battersea Arts
Centre from 19th-
23rd
May.

Walter Benjamin wrote that
“memory is not an instrument
for exploring the past, but its
theatre. It is the medium of
past experience”. While this
may be true, I feel that actually
the theatre is an instrument
for exploring both our memory
and our past. The theatre
can transport us, to far flung
place, and long-dead cities; the
theatre can delight us, its witty
wordplay creating sublime joy;
and the theatre can horrify
us, forcing us to confront all
that is unspeakable about our
collective experience.
This week, Felix Arts takes a
look at four new London theatre
productions, all of which – in
a myriad of ways – explore
the role that theatre can play
in our lives. We start off with
Clara Clark Nevola’s review of
TheSiege, currently on at the
Battersea Arts Centre. A piece
by the Freedom Theatre, based
in the West Bank, TheSiege
reminds us all of the way culture
and theatre has influenced and
affected conflicts, not least in
the Levant.
Clara then heads over the the
St James Theatre, where their
latest production, McQueen, is
resurrecting the past, bringing
the late designer back to life.
Only theatre has the power
to actually bring a sense of
physicality to a ghost, allowing it
to tread the boards.
We then check out the National
Theatre’s latest production, a
performance of the restoration
comedy TheBeaux’Stratagem;
through watching such theatre,
not only do we delight our
senses, but we also sharpen our
minds on the wits of playwrights
past, in this case Irish writer
George Farquhar.
Finally, Jingjie Cheng is taken
across the globe through
the Ninagawa Company’s
production of Hamlet. Taking
its cues from Japanese
traditions, Ninagawa’s Hamlet
is a perfect fusion between two
diametrically different cultures,
highlighting the similarities we
share as members of a common
humanity, and the enduring
power both of Shakespeare’s
language and that of culture as
a whole.
