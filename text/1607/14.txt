Diba Esbati’s tips for navigating the maze that is
private sector accommodation
It’s that time of year when most of
us have to look for a place to live
again, and I don’t know about you,
but for me looking for housing in
the private sector is one of the most
stressful times of the year. It comes
at a time where we’re all busy with
project work and exams, and the last
thing we want is to be worried about
whether or not we’ll be homeless next
year.
Having been in London and having
been forced to deal with the private
accommodation sector for three years
now, I’ve picked up a few things that
will be useful to keep in mind when
looking for a new place to live.
Pick a decent estate agent
It’s no secret that estate agents
have a tendency to bleed you dry
with different administration costs
ranging from verifying guarantors
to taking inventory, but some are
worse than others so do your research
before you decide which estate
agent you want to sell your soul to.
Your first point of contact should
be your friends who have had to
deal with them before, they are the
ones who know how responsive the
estate agents’ are when it comes to
responding to your email about the
faulty fire alarm versus how quickly
they get on your case about the mould
they saw on one corner of the kitchen
window when they came for their
biannual inspection. If that sounds
oddly specific, it’s because it IS, and
everyone who has had to deal with
estate agents has stories like these,
so make sure to ask around! If you
don’t feel comfortable enough asking,
online reviews are also a good place
to check.
Transport links
Although most students tend
to congregate in the usual areas
like High Street Kensington and
Hammersmith, you might choose to
wander a bit further from campus,
and that’s fine! The most important
thing to take into account is how
exactly you’re going to make it in
for your 9am lecture. If you cycle,
make sure to check out the route
before deciding on a place to make
sure you can handle doing it almost
every day for 9 months come hell or
high water. If you’re a bus person,
check to see if there are any 24 hour
routes near you for those late nights
in the lab. You don’t want to have to
be forced to camp out in the library
because you missed the last bus. Also,
it’s worth thinking about the rent vs
transport costs issue. Obviously, if
you’re closer to campus and generally
walk, you can afford to spend a little
more on rent, but if you were going to
take a bus anyway, it might be worth
thinking about moving a little further
away to save some money seeing as
how you were going to invest in a bus
pass either way.
Budget for utilities
Something some of us forget to
account for when looking for a
new place, especially if it’s our first
time paying for utilities directly, is
budgeting for how much they cost.
This is a fairly easy thing to figure
out, just ask the current tenants
roughly how much they pay. If they
don’t know, or aren’t there when
you go to look around, you could
always ask the person who’s showing
you around or check online for the
average cost for the area and then
adjust it slightly. As a general rule,
students tend to spend more than
the average on electricity (because of
computers, gaming equipment, and
late nights) and less on gas (because
we’re lazy and don’t cook as much,
and tend to spend less time at home
so don’t have the heating on as often
as the average family).
Insulation
Definitely ask about the insulation
in the flat. Are the windows double
glazed? Is it a corner property or
are there people on either side you
can mooch heat off of? It’s not that
pressing an issue in June when
you’re looking for a flat, but come
November, you’ll be glad you paid
attention to the windows when you’re
not spending a fortune on heating or
freezing your arse off while wearing
fifty different layers.
Pay attention to the hob, washing
machine, and fridge!
Do all the burners work? How old is
the washing machine? Does it have a
dryer? Is the fridge big enough for the
number of people you have in your
flat? Not enough people tell you this,
because it seems like common sense,
but if it’s your first time looking for a
flat you tend to overlook these kinds
of things, which is how I ended up
living in a flat sharing one minifridge
between 4 people. Also, I cannot stress
how important it is to have a freezer!
Freezers save lives (and money,
mostly money)! The condition of
the appliances can drastically affect
your quality of life not only because
you’re the one who has to use them
for at least a year, but also because
they reflect how much of a shit the
landlord gives about their tenants.
Mould sucks and you don’t want
any
This is probably something that
you hear all the time, but I know I’ve
been guilty of forgetting all about
it in my excitement about the fact
that “wow, so the TV comes with the
flat?”. Checking for mould is super
important, and not just because it can
cause respiratory problems. Mould
generally means there is a humidity
problem in the property and there is
most probably nothing you can do
about. Humidity in a house is awful,
your clothes don’t ever dry, you can’t
leave anything on your windowsill
without it getting soaked, and perhaps
worst of all, it messes with your WiFi
signal! So if you care about having a
decent internet connection, and let’s
be honest, we all do, you’ll check the
corners and windows for mould.
These are obviously just a few
things to take into account before
deciding on a property, so make sure
to look online for more advice. And
remember, the student hub is great
for this kind of thing.
