Brandon Flowers going solo
has always been an interesting
proposition, begging the question:
when it comes to The Killers and
everything they’ve done, how much
of their sound is down to him?
First album Flamingo didn’t do
much to help answer that question,
with half of the album feeling like
Killers-lite, and the other half
spiralling off into a muted (yet
dance-y) world of Fleetwood Mac,
Kate Bush, and so on. His latest
album, The Desired Effect, wanders
even further down the road of 80s
soft rock, arguably drawing a much
clearer line between The Killers and
Flowers as a solo artist. Compare
Battle Born (The Killers’ last album)
and The Desired Effect, and you’ll find
two very, very different beasts.
Of course, regardless of that sonic
divide, the lead singer of any popular
band going solo comes with certain
expectations. You only need look
at Gerard Way’s recent(ish) solo
tours, and how they sold out almost
instantly on the back of his work in
My Chemical Romance to find proof
of that. Should you need further
proof, simply turn up to any of Way’s
gigs. If the sheer quantity of people
wearing My Chemical Romance shirts
don’t convince you, nothing will.
It’s no surprise, then, that Flower’s
first slot at the O2 Academy, Brixton
sold out in less than a minute. A
second date was added, and sold out
a minute after that went on sale.
Obviously.
The stalls of the Academy fill
out rapidly. The support act get a
moderate reaction, although the
loudest whoops are reserved for the
moment where they thank Flowers
for giving them the support slot. They
disappear, then after a longer wait
than expected, the lights dim, and
Flowers’ supporting band take to the
stage. It’s all moody lighting, and a
hell of a lot of cheering, whooping,
screaming. Then Flowers strides
out in a glittery jacket, and all hell
breaks loose. A brief moment for him
to acknowledge the audience, then
he kicks right off into Desired Effect
opener, ‘Dreams Come True’.
It’s followed quickly by second
track (and lead single) ‘Can’t Deny
My Love’, suggesting this might
be a straight run-through of the
new album (don’t worry, it wasn’t).
Throughout, Flowers hardly ever
stands still, moving the length of
the stage repeatedly. Everyone in
this room has paid to see them, and
everyone’s going to get a chance
to. He hops up onto the monitors,
lapping up the excitement of the
crowd, holding the microphone out to
let the crowd fill the gaps he leaves in
the chorus. He’s loving every minute,
and so are the crowd.
Flowers doesn’t talk much through
those tracks and next song ‘Crossfire’,
the big hit from Flamingo. There’s
the traditional “Hello London”, but
that’s pretty much it. ‘Magdalena’
gets his first little speech of the night,
explaining the context behind the
song. ‘Hard Enough’ is the first quiet
moment of the night, before Flowers
drops his trump card. Gerard Way
opted not to play any of My Chemical
Romance’s songs during his first UK
tour. Flowers is less concerned about
any of that.
He gives a short spiel on how this
tour has given him a chance to look
at Killers songs anew, reworking
them into something new, something
different. The crowd, predictably,
goes bananas. With that, an
acoustic(ish), moody version of ‘Jenny
Was a Friend of Mine’. It feels like
it’s been stripped out of a Western,
a dark, country-esque version of the
classic. And it’s wonderful.
‘Jenny’ is quickly followed up by the
punchy, irresistible ‘Lonely Town’
and the driving ‘I Can Change’ (both
from the new album), before The
Killers rear their head again in the
shape of ‘Read My Mind’. The crowd
know every word, and this new spin
on the song goes down just as well,
if not better, than ‘Jenny’. After the
euphoria of that, ‘Swallow It’, one of
the more minor songs from Flamingo
feels like a bit too much of a come-
down. ‘Only the Young’ doesn’t quite
manage to salvage the drop in mood,
before the Jacques Lu Cont remix of
‘Mr. Brightside’ storms in to wrap up
the main set. It takes a few moments
to recognise the song, but as soon as
everyone does things go absolutely
haywire. There’s nothing quite like it.
The encore proves to be special for
different reasons, as Flowers talks
about the influences behind The

Killers, and how no-one ever seems to
acknowledge The Pretenders as one
of those influences. So he promptly
introduces Chrissie Hynde for a
cover of The Pretenders’ ‘Don’t Get
Me Wrong’, followed by a duet with
her on his own ‘Between Me and You’.
There’s another speech, discussing the
twelve years that Flowers has been
performing on stage, and thanking
the person who’s “been sharing [him]
with [the audiences] for all these
years,” his wife, who he eventually
coaxes on stage with two of his kids.
It’s a cute moment, leading nicely
into ‘Still Want You’.
The high of that song then slows,
slipping into closer ‘The Way It’s
Always Been’. It feels like an odd lull
to end on, but it’s the way The Desired
Effect bows out. It makes perfect sense
for Flowers to take his leave on the
same note.
His album, The Desired Effect, is out
now.
