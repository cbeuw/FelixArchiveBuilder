Can you spell A Cappella?
It’s a well-known fact that comedy
sequels are tricky. For every
occasional good one, there is a whole
host of bad ones. Pitch Perfect was
one of 2009 most surprising hits,
making back its money in a big
way and having one of the most
downloaded soundtracks of the year.
With almost all of the original cast
back, and Elizabeth Banks taking on
the role of director after she produced
the first one, does this film manage to
not be a disappointment like so many
sequels are? Well, kinda.
The Barden Bellas are back, three
time ICCA champions and one of the
most respected names in A Cappella.
As is to be expected this all goes
horribly wrong fairly quickly and
rather spectacularly at an event
involving suspension from the
ceiling, an American President and a
lack of underwear.
Things go from bad to worse for
the Bellas, now the laughing stock of
the US, are banned from competing
in the champions and recruiting new
members.
Their only hope is win the World
Championships, and competition that
no American team has never won.
Because the world hates America.
No, I’m not making some crude
comment, this is literally a joke from
the film.
Elizabeth Banks and John Michael
Higgins, who were spot on in the first
film as the occasionally inappropriate
commentators, take the humour
way too far in this film, and it just
becomes crass rather than amusing.
It’s also seen in one of the only two
new Bellas that get any screen time.
Yes, she’s from Guatemala, but that
doesn’t mean that literally every word
out of her mouth needs to be about
that fact.
Whilst there was a great chance
to expand on the one dimensional
characters from the first film, this
one does just the opposite, making
those characters seem even more flat
and cliché.
The lesbian is the lesbian, the slut is
the slut, the Latina is the Latina.
It’s just as bad with the new rivals
in the film, the German team DSM.
We meet them time and time again,
but their characters never really do
much. They’re the haughty attractive
foreigners, and that’s all there really
is to them.
It’s not all bad though. Though
some of the film feels tired as they
repeat popular scenes and scenarios
from the first film, there is enough
new content and original jokes that it
still gets a lot of laughs.
Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy remains
the star of the comedy, lightening
up the script with her often bizarre
improvisation.
What is possibly the best scene in
the film involves her, a lake and the
best make-out scene in recent cinema.
Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld playing
Emily, the only character to really get
any sort of development, is wonderful
in her role.
She’s the bumbling, awkward,
overly enthusiastic first year, that
we probably all were, and far more
relatable that Anna Kendrick’s Beca
from the original film.
She’s the heart of the film, and her
developing romance throughout the
film is just delightful to watch.
The romance in general is dealt
with well. Many sequels fall into the
trap of not really knowing what to do,
so throw in a bit of romantic tension
and upset to bring in the audience
desperate to see if they make up.
This film doesn’t do this, instead
having Beca and Jesse in a happy
relationship that gets barely any
mentions other than a couple kisses
and conversations.
It’s a far better way of doing it,
and gives more screen time to more
interesting things, like the budding
romances this one has to offer.
The soundtrack gives out some
great numbers, but it doesn’t quite
live up to the first, and though this
was a deliberate choice made by the
creators of the film to show how the
Bellas have lost their sound, it’s a bit
of shame as the stellar soundtrack is
what made Pitch Perfect such a hit.
Overall, it might not be aca-
awesome, but at least it’s not an aca-
disappointment.

This week
at Imperial
Cinema
This week at Imperial Cinema
we have Cinderella,Disney’s
latest take on the classic Italian
folk tale.
If you’re not familiar with the
plot,the basic gist is that Ella,
an orphan,lives with her cruel
stepmother and stepsisters.
Soon,however,she meets a
dashing stranger in the woods
and her fortunes begin to take a
very different turn.
This charm-filled,critically
acclaimed retelling of the
story was shot at various
locations across England and
has outstanding performances
from Lily James as the titular
hero to Cate Blanchett as the
wicked stepmother,and Helena
Bonham Carter as The Fairy
Godmother.
The success of both Cinderella
and Maleficent has led Disney
to announce more live-action
remakes of their classic
animated features,with Alice
ThroughTheLookingGlass set to
be released in 2016.
Cinderella is playing on Tuesday
2nd
June at 7pm,and then again
on Thursday 4th
of June,also at
7pm.
Tickets are £3 for members and
£4 for non-members.
Doors open around 15 minutes

amusing."
