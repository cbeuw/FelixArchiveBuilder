Jack Steadman is resoundingly disappointed by Disney’s latest
Dreaming of a better world film
Tomorrowland: A World Beyond
is in the running for year’s most
pointless subtitle. It exists only for
the UK, with every other territory
simply being treated to the original
title of Tomorrowland, sans subtitle.
It’s a needless addition that tries to
define the film further while failing
to actually explain anything about
what’s going on. It’s an apt metaphor
for the film, to be honest.
Tomorrowland (we’re just calling it
that from now on) is the latest film
to be based on part of the Disneyland
theme parks, joining the illustrious
likes of Pirates of the Caribbean and…
the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
The other films to be based on
Disney rides don’t really bear talking
about, unless you want something to
complain about.
It’s got a far amount of promise
on paper despite that slightly
worrisome heritage, though. Brad
Bird is the director responsible for
Pixar’s classics The Incredibles and
Ratatouille, before making the leap
into live-action with the joyous
Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.
The cast features the likes of George
Clooney and Hugh Laurie. The script
was co-written by Bird with Damon
Lindelof, one of the main men
behind LOST. That’s pretty much
where the promise starts to dry up,
really. At least on paper.
Britt Robertson gets her first major
role in this film, and she absolutely
kills it. She plays Casey Newton, an
optimist in a world going downhill,
and a girl who sneaks onto the
NASA launch site at Cape Canaveral,
disabling the machines dismantling
the pad. Robertson is a revelation,
displaying deft comic timing and
infectious enthusiasm. She makes
some absolute clunkers of lines sound
hilarious, and she pushes the film
through several of its struggles. She
lights up the film around her, which
is why the way the script ultimately
treats her character is such a
crushing disappointment.
Casey is constantly set up
throughout the film as being ‘special’.
Everything appears to focus on
her, and with the help of Raffedy
Cassidy’s Athena she’s the main
driving force of the plot. Quite why
she’s special is never fully outlined
for most of the running time,
although it slowly becomes clear that
her special power is (drumroll please)
the power of positive thinking.
And if you think this is a somewhat
pointless special power that has no
ability to push a plot forwards, then
don’t worry. The filmmakers appear
to agree with you. Casey is completely
side-lined for the film’s finale. That
whole section of the film is absurdly
rushed – from the moment Casey,
Athena and George Clooney’s Frank
Walker arrive in Tomorrowland
itself, the plot barrels towards an
inevitable “let’s blow everything up”
finale. Sod positive thinking. We
have explosives.
Those explosives signal the death
knell for any hope that Tomorrowland
might pull itself together in the home
straight. Hugh Laurie’s villain gets
an entertaining speech that pulls
off the marvellous trick of actually
convincing you that the villain might
be right (which admittedly, when
the heroes are as full of absolute
fluff as the heroes of Tomorrowland
are, doesn’t require a huge amount
of effort). George Clooney’s natural
charm is allowed to shine through
as his character starts to warm up.
There’s some semi-decently shot
action. It could all work, and then
Tomorrowland stumbles across its
thematic football. It takes a run-up,
aims, and then completely misses
and ends up sprawled in the dirt. It’s
such a waste.
Tomorrowland is an enjoyable ride,
it should be said. It’s enjoyable,
but heavily flawed. It never quite
understands what its own message is,
and during the few moments where
that message does start to flicker into
life it’s complete nonsense. Most of
the acting is excellent, but it’s forced
to cope with an inadequate script
that has forgotten what it’s trying to
do, and how it planned to do it in the
first place.
This is a film to watch, once, enjoy,
and then forget about. It doesn’t
say anything worth hearing. It
fails to stick in the memory, and
that’s honestly a good thing. It’s so
painfully confused that it’s almost
upsetting. There’s a lot of good work
that went into Tomorrowland, from
the sumptuous visuals to the sterling
efforts of the cast. It’s just buried
beneath a pile of meaningless junk.
