Union releases second impact report
The Chemical Engineering
department has announced
two new scholarships.
The scholarships, which will
provide tuition fees, a significant
maintenance allowance, and a
travel bursary, are made possible by
a “generous gift” from Mrs Marit
Mohn, who graduated from the
department in 1973).
The scholarships, which are for PhD
students of any nationality, form
part of the extension of the Marit
Mohn PhD scholarship scheme. The
scheme was started in 2011, when it
was established by another donation
from Mrs Mohn. This is the latest
in a string of donations made by
Mrs Mohn to support education at
Imperial College London.
Speaking about the new scholarship
Andrew Livingston, head of the
department of Chemical Engineering,
said “Her [Marit Mohn] support for
scholarships is offering life-changing
opportunities for generations of
chemical engineers.” He went on
to say that staff at the department
“are hugely grateful, not just for her
financial support, but also for her
interest in the department and its
development.”
The first scholar is expected to join
the College in October 2015, with
the second scholar following roughly
a year later. The extension of the
Marit Mohn PhD scholarship scheme
means that the department will now
have three scholarships available.
Donor Marit Mohn said of her
donation, “The Department of
Chemical Engineering at Imperial
is among the world’s leaders and, as
an alumna, I am proud to contribute
to its further success and to give
something back to the UK higher
education system. Excellence in
engineering will be a key to solving
many of the problems the world faces
today.”
Professor Jeff Magee, who is Dean of
the Faculty of Engineering, was also
in high spirits, adding “Philanthropic
support for scholarships is hugely
important. It gives us the flexibility
to recruit the very best candidates
in priority research areas, or in
important fields that are relatively
underfunded by public money. The
impact of Marit Mohn’s generosity
will be felt across the Department of
Chemical Engineering for many years
to come.”
This week Imperial College Union
published their second termly impact
report of this academic year.
The report aims to summarise
the big effects that Imperial College
Union has achieved in the past term,
and benchmarks its progress on
improving the student experience,
community, and voice, as well as
making sure that the Union becomes
a sustainable organisation.
The first section focuses on
“Enhancing the Student Experience”.
Here the report highlights Imperial
Plus, a scheme whereby student
representatives and those involved
can log the hours they spend
volunteering to work towards a scaled
qualification system. The number of
students has doubled since last year,
but the number of hours logged has
not increased by anywhere near the
same margin, perhaps indicating a
fall in enthusiasm.
Also commented on is Community
Connections, described as a
“volunteer brokerage service”. The
Union reports an 18% increase in
organisation uptake, but only a 10%
increase in the number of students
attending. This, combined with the
emphasis on the views of the Times
Higher Education survey perhaps
suggesting that more work needs to be
done to get students on board.
The Student Experience section also
mentions the Student Volunteering,
January’s Give it a Go events and
Refreshers’ Fair, with all receiving
“positive feedback”.
In the “Amplifying the Student
Voice” section, the report turns
to celebrating the achievements
of this year’s officer trustees, in
particular Union President Tom
Wheeler, Deputy President (Welfare)
Chris Kaye and Deputy President
(Education) Pascal Loose.
The Impact Report from Term
1 focussed heavily on responses to
national surveys, but the report here
highlights the Union’s wins on the
Student Academic Choice awards, the
controversial “victory on halls rents”,
and the high turnout for this year’s
big elections.
The report then turns to “Building
a Student Community”, in which
much is made on the new ‘Campaigns’
sections of the website. Mentality,
ICSexism and Fossil Free Imperial
have been active [Mentality is
featured in this week’s issue – ed]
all term, with some being involved
in (and outposts of) national
movements.
The report also documents the
launch of: #impics, the Union’s
sponsored hashtag for clubs and
societies, which has had 30 posts
so far on Twitter; and h-bar’s wine
tasting event, which saw 20 attendees
at the end of last term.
The final section of the report
concerns “Building a Sustainable
Organisation”, focussing on financial
stability, work environment,
and green impact. The report
announces the movement of payroll
to eActivities, the increasingly
ubiquitous cyan and magenta themed
web portal for Union activity,
and the retaining of Investors in
People status. It is interesting that
where sustainability is concerned,
there is no mention of the Union’s
strategic aim to achieve Investing in
Volunteers status.
The report concludes by stating that
the Union is “proud to be a member-
led organisation”, referring to the
officer trustees. Union staff compiled
