This week we are publishing the
results from the student-led
mental health survey, that
has finally quantified a lot of the
anxiety and disquiet students at
Imperial feel on a monthly, weekly
and even daily basis. The survey,
put together by the Imperial College
Union campaign Mentality, has given
students an opportunity to voice their
experiences with stress and mental
health, and although the results are
shocking, they are not surprising.
Mental health is important. Talking
about mental health is important,
and sharing advice and support about
mental health is also important. The
mentality campaign has done a great
job of raising awareness and opening
a dialogue about mental health, and
they have made a great number of
recommendations for the treatment
and support for students who suffer
from mental health conditions too.
Although some may be easier to
implement than others, all are worth
doing if they make just one student
more capable of getting to the end
of their degree and leaving with a
qualification they deserve.
When it comes to managing
student stress though, it is unclear as
to why some of the more simplistic
mechanisms that could alleviate a lot
of the pressure have not been put in
place before.
Stress and mental wellbeing are
two ends of the same spectrum,
and although we can never say
definitively that too much stress can
lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia
etc, I have definitely seen friends and
peers pushed to the limit with work
load and revision and starting to
exhibit symptoms that were a cause
for concern.
Students at Imperial are clever,
hard-working individuals; they
wouldn’t have made it past the first
week of term if they weren’t. We are
students that thrive in competition
and relish in success; great traits for
the working world, but potentially
harmful in large quantities when still
trying to balance student life with all
the other pressures of being a young
adult.
Imperial can often harbour a
rather intensive work environment,
with many students all too familiar
with working all-nighters, balancing
multiple deadlines, struggling to
find the hours in the day to complete
coursework and burning out before
exams.
The survey found that 39% of
students suffer from mental stresses.
Some stress is good for students; it
drives them to finish lab reports,
revise for exams and keeps them on
their toes. It is only when this stress
starts to hinder a student’s ability to
focus on other essential areas of life
does this stress becomes damaging,
and may be one of the factors that
has driven the student satisfaction at
Imperial so low in previous years.
Students time and time again
complain to their department
representatives and the Union
about mounting deadlines, clashing
coursework submissions and other
factors of their degrees that add to
this stress, and it is the sort of stress
that can push students over the edge,
whatever the edge may be for certain
people.
I remember a particularly
harrowing all-nighter spent in the
library as my classmates and I battled
to complete seven lab reports all due
in for the following day; most of them
managed, but I remember one just
passing out and going home soon
after.
The stress of those deadlines and
the fallout from missing them could
have been avoided if scheduling had
been done more conscientiously,
and it is little things like this that
can make the life of a student more
pleasant.
Imperial was never meant to be
easy; knowing us, we would have left
complaining about what a waste of
money it was if we weren’t getting
millions of contact hours and lab
sessions. However there are simple
things that Imperial can do to
keep students satisfied with their
education and not result in 75% of
students being mentally distressed in
some way.
Simple things like getting
departments to spend that little bit
longer teaching students just how
to learn from lectures and tutorials
instead of throwing them in at the
deep end, or spacing out deadlines so
they don’t all sit in the middle of an
Easter holiday or at the end of a term
can all help students make it to the
end of the year without burning out,
stressing out, and even potentially
dropping out as a result.
Personal tutors being trained
in understanding the concerns of
students is another key improvement
that would work wonders in the lives
of many nervous undergraduates (and
postgraduates) could catch students
as they fall at the first hurdle; I
remember in my first week at
Imperial going home at the weekend
because I just couldn’t cope (plus I
was too hungover to breathe, let alone
cook for myself).
I was lucky to have an incredible
personal tutor who checked in on me
to make sure I was ok, and made me
feel more comfortable in what was a
pretty stressful year all in all. Imagine
if I hadn’t come back after that first
weekend: who would print all the
typos in this paper then?
I hope College takes on board the
recommendations Mentality have
made, but doesn’t overlook the simple
things it can do straight away to alter
the ethos of Imperial at departmental
levels and below. Having welfare
seminars behind closed doors doesn’t
help anyone.
Take a leaf out of Mentality’s book
and get people talking: arrange for
tutors, lecturers and course convenors
to talk to each other, to share best
practice and making things easier for
students as soon as they walk into the
lecture theatre. You might find that
other, bigger concerns might improve
as a result too.
