Losing yourself in Venice: to boat, or
not to boat
Perhaps one of the most
frequently asked question
for travelers in Venice is
whether they should take the
water buses or not.
And the answer to these
questions, as always, is that it
depends. On what exactly, you
might ask? Here’s a list of factors
for you to consider:
1) Are you able to walk for long
periods of time?
Navigation is one part of the
equation. Given the maze like
layout you are likely to do a lot of
walking back and forth.
2) Do you have the money?
A single journey costs €7, and a
day pass €20. Even for a Londoner
these prices are pretty steep. If the
answer is yes, then no problem for
you! But if it’s no, then consider
finding accommodation in a
centrally located area.
3) Where is your hotel?
If your hotel is central, then
getting one ride there and
walking the rest of the trip
might be a good idea. However,
the train station Santa Lucia is
a good 40 minutes’ walk from St
Marks Square that is the center of
Venice. This should give you an
idea of how far you need to walk.
It’s also extremely easy to get lost
on your way so make sure you
know where your hotel or hostel
is before you arrive.
I stayed at a hotel on the top
right corner of mainland Venice.
It was super easy to find but
also means I had to do a lot of
walking.
4) Can you navigate?
This might sound like a silly
question, but it’s a valid one.
Venice is maze of a city with
dozens of canals connected by
bridges and hidden alleyways that
look rather dodgy. It’s virtually
impossible not to get lost and
getting from point A to B is not as
simple as it is in normal cities. On
my trip I had to use google map to
navigate and to know where I am
– this is how hard it is.
5) How many journeys do you
plan to make that day?
If you are planning to hit a few
islands on the day, then perhaps
it’s worth getting the day pass.
Note, however that you should
check the routes and timetables
on the website as going from
island to island might not be an
easy option.
What did you do? Some of
you might ask, and I walked
throughout my entire time on
Venice. Was it tiring? Yes – but
you get to see so much more of
Venice’s beauty on foot than by
boat. Not all canals are reachable
by water bus, and maybe the view
is different on the water but I
enjoyed crossing beautiful bridges
and breezing pass little alleyways.
Second of all, the canals are
not exactly what you call clean.
Though regulated by the city to
maintain a certain standard, the
water is still a green-blue opaque
that you do not want to get into
close contact with.
Thirdly, I saved a whopping €80
by not taking the water bus for
four days. There are moments
when I genuinely regretted my
decision, for example when I had
to walk 40 minutes back from St
Mark’s Square to our hotel with
a bursting bladder. So to boat, or
not to boat, that is the question
that only you can answer.
