ACollege-wide survey has found
that three out of four students
have suffered from high levels
of stress or a mental health condition
whilst at Imperial.
The online survey, completed by
over a thousand students, found that
39% of all respondents have suffered
from mental stresses.
21% had or have been diagnosed
with a mental health condition
and a further 16% suspect they
have a mental illness but are yet
to be diagnosed. Only 15% of the
total respondents said they had
experienced no mental health
conditions or damaging stress levels
at all.
Out of those who have been
diagnosed with a mental health
condition, 67% suffer from
depression, 42.4% suffer from
anxiety, and 16% suffer from an
eating disorder, amongst others. 42%
of all those diagnosed with a mental
health condition were suffering from
multiple illnesses.
The survey also found that 69.5%
of those that suffer from stress do
so at least once a week, and 9% of
students feel stressed constantly. 1 in
2 students feel anxious at least once a
week, and nearly a quarter of students
feel self-loathing over the same
period of time.
36% of all respondents to the survey
said they have had thoughts of self
harm at least once a year, and 35%
reported they had have thoughts of
suicide over the same time period.
9% of respondents reported having
suicidal thoughts at least once a week.
When students described the
various sources of their mental
distress, 77% cited exams and
revision, 64% cited concern over
grades and academic performance,
and 60% cited worry over balancing
studying with other commitments.
Of note was that 35% of students
worry over employability, despite
Imperial being ranked first in the
UK for career prospects in a recent
Guardian university league table.
When dividing the data by gender,
it was interesting to note that
females and males suffered from
different causes of stress at different
proportions.
For males, 73% cited exams and
revision as a cause of stress, whilst
82% of females cited exams and
revision as a cause. 56% of females
cited low self-esteem as a cause of
stress, whilst only 34% of males stated
that self-esteem caused them mental
distress too.
144 postgraduate students also
filled in the survey, and 23% cited
publication pressure as a cause
for mental stress. 19% also stated
that their relation with supervisor
causes stress. 1 in 3 cited financial
difficulties as something that lead to
stress too.
When looking at the results
collected from LGBT students, it
was found that 38% of those that
identify as either lesbian, gay,
bisexual or queer find issues related
to sexual orientation as causes for
stress. Low self-esteem affected a
higher proportion of LGBT students
when compared to as a whole to the
students who identify as heterosexual.
The survey also addressed what
provisions students were aware were
available at Imperial, and how many
students had used in the past. 28%
of students said they didn’t disclose
their feelings of mental distress with
anyone, although more than half did
say they confided in friends. 20%
said they saw a GP, and 13% said they
approached their personal tutor.
Around 1 in 4 students who have
been diagnosed with a mental illness
said they did not access any of the
support services at Imperial. Out of
those who had used the services, 19%
said they didn’t know where to find
information about the services, whilst
16% said they had issues with long
waiting times.
The survey was designed and ran
by Imperial College Union campaign
group Mentality, and collected data
through an online questionnaire
circulated last term.
Mentality has been campaigning
throughout the year to raise
awareness around mental wellbeing at
Imperial, and educate students about
the importance of mental health. The
survey results were published in a
report earlier this week.
The report included a list of
recommendations for improvements
that could be made to the services
available, which included reviewing
and improving the training of
personal tutors, hall wardens and hall
seniors, and the potential to set up a
trained student peer support groups,
which are proving beneficial to be in
other universities across the country.
The report also outlined
improvements that could be made to
the Counselling services, including
introducing “out of hours” support
and extra provisions during more
intense times of the year.
The Mentality campaign is lead
by Beth Davison, a second year
undergraduate student studying
physics. She was inspired to start
the campaign after suffering from
depression in her first year of study.
The results of the survey were
released earlier this week during
the 7th
Annual Welfare Seminar
“The Problems students face,” that
took place in the Royal School
of Mines building. Beth, other
students involved with the Mentality
Campaign, and members of Imperial
College Union staff presented the
results to members of College staff
present at the seminar.
The seminar was not open to
students to attend. However
representatives from Imperial
College Union, including Union
President Tom Wheeler, engaged in
