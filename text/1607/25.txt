Ninagawa’s Hamlet shows a new Bard
Right from the outset, Ninagawa
Company’s Hamlet looked
like it had been plucked out
of an ancient Japanese film. Blue
fog shrouded the stage as Hamlet,
Horatio, and the guards dart across
the stage, confronted by the ghost
of Hamlet’s father. Spine-chilling
Eastern music beats steadily in the
background. The ghost, draped
in robes befitting of a Japanese
emperor, weaved in and out of a
row of two-storey wooden houses –
the permanent set through which
characters dash onto the stage from
various directions.
Hamlet himself, played by
long-time Ninagawa boy Tatsuya
Fujiwara, reminded me of an anime
character or a hero from a Japanese
sword-fighting drama. With his
curly, unkempt hair and black,
billowing robes complete with a
silver chain around his neck, it is
easy for us non-Japanese to associate
everything on stage with what is
familiarly ‘Japanese’ to us. However,
it becomes clear that Yukio Ninagawa,
a director known for his take on
Shakespeare, classical Greek tragedy,
and contemporary productions,
means more than simply to transpose
English literature to a Japanese
setting.
Perhaps the way the story
seamlessly fits into a completely
different setting highlights the
universality of Hamlet’s internal
struggle and increasing isolation,
intensely portrayed by Fujiwara.
His anguish was palpable – even on
the many occasions where he was
alone on stage, his internal turmoil
expanded to fill the stage.
Motoi Hattori’s lighting is
impeccable, with the ghost king
emerging from eerie blue fog,
Claudius and Gertrude bathed in a
royal and almost incriminating red
aura, while Hamlet delivers his ‘to
be or not to be’ speech while walking
through a shaft of piercing white
light. Dramatic lighting played a
huge role in blowing up appropriately
intense and dramatic scenes, as well
as highlighting the turmoil within
the conflicted Hamlet and guilty
Claudius.
Indeed, there is a grandeur to
this production that I rarely see in
traditional takes on Shakespeare,
which nowadays tend to be
minimalist in stage set and prop
use. The extravagance of the puppet
scene, for example, emphasizes the
elaborate farce that reigns in the
court, where brother sins against
brother and then weds his widow.
Painted actors resembling traditional
Japanese puppetry enact a carefully
constructed script of betrayal,
but when Claudius realizes that it
parallels his own backstabbing of
his brother, he storms out in rage
and guilt. What ensues on stage is
overwhelming, slow-motion chaos.
The collapse of the controlled drama
into flashing lights, dramatic music
and utter pandemonium on stage
mirrors the breakdown of Claudius’
image created upon his brother’s
death, and from this point onwards
Claudius begins to fear Hamlet and
for his tenuous hold on the throne.
Ninagawa is not afraid to go all
the way in exposing the characters’
inner struggles in dramatic visual
representations – in the scene
following the puppet show, Claudius
is seen dousing himself in a bucket
of water and then beating himself
with a rope, clearly anguished and
tormented by his fear and guilt. He
then quietly prays while Hamlet
approaches him from behind, all the
while gripping his sword, unsure of
the wisdom of killing him there and
then.
Perhaps the most nuanced and
heart-wrenching performance comes
from Hikari Mitsushima’s Ophelia,
who is introduced to us as a gentle girl
discussing with her father Hamlet’s
perceived advances towards her. Her
dainty innocence is progressively
corrupted in the play as she is first
violently treated by Hamlet, who
screams at her to go off to a nunnery,
then loses her father Polonius when
Hamlet kills him accidentally. She is
clearly terrified by Hamlet’s change,
but it is upon learning of her father’s
death that she descends into a delicate
madness. It was almost as if her
innocence could not stand up against
the farce and cruelty in court, and like
the flowers she hands out to the other

Jingjie Cheng finds that Shakespeare’s language is universal
"Ninagawa’s
unique take
on Hamlet
explores
a new
dimension
of the story,
enhancing
the play"
"The story
seamlessly
fits
into the
completely
different
Japanese
setting"
characters in her delirium (‘rosemary
is for remembrance’), she is easily
trampled upon and swept aside in
the midst of betrayal and greed.
Mitsushima’s Ophelia was one of
the inadvertent victims of Hamlet’s
own conflicts – but her purity and
deep, untainted love for her father
was perhaps the only redeeming good
in the dark and twisted halls of the
Danish court.
Ran Ohtori’s Gertrude, on the
other hand, was a bland, somewhat
one-dimensional character whose
own conflicts were not fully explored.
It seemed to me that she was a docile
woman who willingly followed
whoever was in power, without fully
understanding her son’s feelings of
betrayal – a relationship that had
potential to be fleshed out.
As Ninagawa himself mentioned,
it seems almost ‘hubris’ to bring
a Japanese adaptation of a classic
English play back to its country of
origin. In my opinion, however, his
unique take on Shakespeare’s longest
play explores a dimension of the
story which enhances its scope for
performance. It is always fascinating
to observe the versatility of literature,
and Ninagawa’s Hamlet certainly does
not disappoint.
