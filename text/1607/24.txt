McQueen: A Well-Cut Piece of Theatre

Clara Clark Nevola is surprised by the heart of this new bio-drama
The National’s Pretty New Diversion
From the title to the timing,
McQueen at the St James’
Theatre has all the hallmarks
of a cheesy opportunistic bio-drama.
But despite the tormented genius
stereotype it conforms to, James
Philip’s play is a brave, moving, and
enchanting portrayal of a person’s
struggle with mental health.
The play coincides with the fifth
anniversary of his death, marked also
by the V&A’s lavish retrospective
Savage Beauty, and the Working Process
photography exhibition at the Tate
Britain earlier this year. Yet the
production is much more than a mere
homage to one of the most iconic
designers; the story it tells is neither
the shocking drugs-and-depression
tabloid version nor the glamorous
Vogue version, though both are
referenced in a stylised, indirect
manner throughout. It is primarily
the story of a person, and his
relationship to reality. It transcends
the narrow confines of the haute
couture celebrity world, portraying
an experience which deeply resonates
with the everyday struggles of human
emotion.
The story is set in a single fantasy
night, a Tim Burtonesque fairy-tale
nightmare reminiscent of McQueen’s
fashion shows. An obsessed groupie
breaks into his house to steal a
dress and, when caught, she and
the designer start talking. She takes
on the role of his inner voice as the
two travel through his memories
and relive key moments from his
life. The dynamic between the two
is completely absorbing – it’s never
clear whether she is real or imaginary,
which creates the disorientating
feeling of being inside someone’s
thoughts. Alexander McQueen is
played by Stephen Wright who,
beyond his uncanny similarity
to the real designer, brings an
exciting, almost scary energy to
the role. Dahlia, the groupie-cum-
alter ego, is played Dianna Agron,
known principally from her role
as Quinn Fabray in Glee. She gives
an unsettling performance, easily
changing between devoted fan, fairy
tale waif, and suicidal psychopath.
There’s something desperate about
her character, a deranged neediness
of incredible emotional power. It’s
not all depressing – moments of
laughter and comedy make this
play an emotional whirlwind, based
on real emotion rather than cheap
tear-jerking tricks. It avoids being
morbid or mawkish and, perhaps
paradoxically, there’s something very
real and vital about McQueen.
The dream-like quality of the two
main characters is enhanced with
some very original staging decisions.
Christopher Manney has created
disconcerting choreographies, with a
top notch dancing troupe who have
an unusually high level of technical
skill for a theatrical production. They
animate each scene as mannequins,
creeping out from the wings and
whirling around Alexander and
Dalhia, unearthly representations of
their inner turmoil. The sets are full
of references to the designer’s work,
with Timothy Bird’s clever video
design combining with the costume
design to recreate the essence of
For every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction.
It seems this rule holds as
true in theatre as it does in physics.
After the cerebral existentialism
of The Hard Problem, the bells-and-
whistles approach of Rules for Living,
and the highly modern adaptation
of Everyman, the National Theatre
return to well-worn theatrical
traditions. The Beaux’ Stratagem
is a streamlined, watertight
performance; it doesn’t offer any
radical reinterpretation of restoration
comedy – and perhaps it doesn’t have
to – but this means that, despite the
ability of the cast and crew, it remains
little more than a light diversion.
One of the last examples of a
Comedy of Manners, The Beaux’
Stratagem was the last play of Irish
playwright George Farquhar, and –
like a majority of works of its time –
has a convoluted, twisting plot, full of
double-dealings, misunderstandings,
and bawdy humour: Aimwell and
Archer, the two beaux of titular fame,
find themselves down on their luck,
their squandering of ten thousand
pounds in London leading them to
Lichfield, where they enact a plan to
ensnare a wealthy bride. Aimwell falls
in love with Dorinda, while Archer
simultaneously woos Dorinda’s sister-
in-law, Mrs Sullen, and Cherry, the
daughter of landlord Boniface. There
are a few obstacles to their plan: Mr
Sullen is still in the picture, despite
the fact that his send-up of a country
squire is the very opposite of the
refined London character of his wife;
Boniface thinks the two gentlemen
are highwaymen, come to rob the
ladies’ house; and then there are
the French prisoners of war to deal
with. Make no mistake, The Beaux’
Stratagem is as convoluted as they
come, but the twists and turns of the
plot are softened by the wit contained
within Farquhar’s script.
However, The Beaux Stratagem
also deals with more serious themes,
mainly the restrictive marriage laws
in England at the time, which made
divorce pretty much non-existent.
This argument reaches a height in a
courtroom-style scene that sees Mr
and Mrs Sullen arguing their cases,
with Mrs Sullen aptly comparing the
golden links of wedlock to the iron
manacles of law. After all the bustle
of the play, this interlude comes as a
surprise, perhaps due to the fact that
much of the sophisticated language
is cribbed from John Milton, giving
it an incongruous edge. Set designer
Lizzie Clachan has created a solid
staging, with a multi-tiered house
whose clever mechanics allow it
to switch from a country inn to a
manor house, underlining the fact
that little separates the behaviour of
the characters but money. Outside
this set, two other places lurk out of

"The Beaux’

McQueen’s creations.
Avoiding the pedantry of
documentary and the maudlin
of tragic biopics, McQueen is a
rare thing: a moving play with
impeccable production standards,
where everything from the script
to the costume details is perfect.
It encapsulates the essence of a
creative genius, while transposing
his struggles into everyone else’s. In
doing so it achieves the theatrical
golden standard of enchantment and
catharsis, giving the audience a few
hours of enthralled, ethereal escape.
McQueen is on at the St James Theatre
until 27th
June. Tickets from £25.
Available online.
sight: the London so esteemed by
Mrs Sullen, and the growing threat of
an expanding France, both of which
colour the plot.
There are no complaints to be made
about the casting, with each actor
handling their part with confidence;
particular mention should go
to Susannah Fielding and Pippa
Bennett-Warner, who play Mrs Sullen
and Dorinda, respectively. They
tackle the meaty parts with aplomb,
transforming them into creatures of
comic timing and wit, who seem to be
prototypes of the Austen heroine who
would come to prominence at the end
of the century.
The Beaux Stratagem is a fine play,
with a solid cast whose skills are
accentuated by the traditional set
design and strong direction of Simon
Godwin; it equals exactly the sum of
its parts. It may not exactly thrill, but
it certainly won’t disappoint.
The Beaux’ Stratagem is on at the
National Theatre until 20th
September.
