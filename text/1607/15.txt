Get on the zine
Summer Camp released their
third LP, Bad Love, this week,
and as well as doing a handful of
promotional in store performances,
they brought out their second ever
zine. Full of comics, poetry and prose
from fans who are also friends, ‘Drive
Past My House’ is a snazzy addition
to any fan’s collection, and perfectly
complements their dreamy, high-
school rom-com aesthetic. Highlights
come in the form of comics from
Babak Ganjei of Wet Paint and
Absentee, whose other work includes
‘Clarkson Blackout’ which improves
Jeremy Clarkson’s autobiography
by selectively deleting 90% of the
text, and John Allison, creator of
‘Scary Go Round’ whose illustrations
imagine Summer Camp’s writing
process, involving Eric Clapton,
a time-machine and 1995. Many
contributors are regular ‘zine’ folk,
but comic novices will recognise
Emmy The Great’s name, and
her Instagram-friendly centrefold
is a novel take on the comic panel
concept. A scripted section sounds
like it could be a spoken word
introduction to their album; think
Savages’ ‘Shut Up’ or every track on
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
Inevitable comparisons of Summer
Camp’s sound to American teen
movies of the 90s, à la Clueless,
are even truer since they wrote
and performed every song on the
soundtrack for ‘Beyond Clueless’,
Charlie Lyne’s documentary about
this art form as a better indication
of the zeitgeist than adult movies
of the same era. The zine certainly
fits with this. Prose pieces describe
‘Michelles’, ‘Donnys’ and archetypal
teen heartthrob Brandon Routh, of
Superman Returns fame. The album
itself is full of pleasing marital
harmonies, and whilst maintaining
that familiar Summer Camp sound
there are stand out tracks. ‘Keep
Out’ is unlike anything we’ve heard
from them before. It’s an aggressive,
marching to meet your ex tune
and manages to feel fresh whilst
having that oh so familiar chord
progression. Jeremy, who usually
sticks to complimenting Elizabeth
Sankles’ main harmony part, takes
centre-stage in ‘You’re Gone’, where
he quietly repeats aspirational lyrics
against fuzzy guitars on the most
raucous song on the album.
Is the zine necessary for full
enjoyment of the album? Probably
not. If you’re not into comics,
illustration or particularly obsessed
with the band then you might not
bother. But, if you’re not particularly
familiar with them, but know you
like their sound and vibe, it might be
worth investing in. Your investment
being £3, and considering you’ll likely
as not stream the album, it might
be nice to have a physical object to
associate with them. In the way that
music videos are important, from the
days of MTV to the present, where
video-streaming counts towards chart
position, band released music zines
are another way to connect to fans.
They’re saying: we like this, visually
this is our vibe, and do you like it too?
In this way, the zine isn’t necessarily
just ‘one for the fans’.
Summer Camp curated their own
zine, and you very much get that
impression. It’s personal, some of
the comics take the mickey out
of themselves and in no way is it
decadent or self-indulgent, without
being firmly tongue in cheek. Will
zines become the done thing across
the board, or amongst big selling
artists? Although interesting to
see what your favourite bands are
interested in visually, it’s hard to
imagine bigger artists curating a
zine without being pretentious as
Summer Camp manage. You really
get the impression that the band
are quite nice; there’s little hint of
self-congratulation, and it feels like
they made it purely for shits and gigs.
They are luckier in the sense that
they don’t have to worry so much
about marginalising the tastes of fans;
Beyoncé would probably struggle to
curate something that would please
the entirety of her huge fanbase.
Unless it was just selfies. Which I
would inevitably still fork out for.
Music zines don’t begin and end
with artist-curated collections.
It would be wrong to talk about
music zines without mentioning
the glorious ‘Not A New Wave’, a
Sleater-Kinney fanzine curated by
One Beat. Without any involvement
from Carrie Brownstein’s riot
grrrl collective, uber fans who
happened to be artists or writers
got together to make a cheap and
cheerful celebration of the band
over 35 pages. I’m not being rude,
One Beat pride themselves on

producing financially accessible
material. The fanzine’s only £4, and
so significantly cheaper than, and
arguably more personal than a band
tee. These zine-makers specialise in
strong feminist influences, and are
putting out a whole book on punk-
rock feminism later this year. What
seems most exciting is how inclusive
they are. The zine scene doesn’t seem
like such an exclusive boy’s club;
e-mail addresses are on the site, so
if you’re a small time illustrator or
just a fan they seem pretty welcome
to contributions. Like fan clubs
subscribed to by fans in the 50s and
60s, zines give people an arena to
discuss and create content around the
band’s themes, whilst simultaneously
creating content that other fans will
inevitably want to see. In this way,
it’s like an annual, like those ones you
get in W H Smiths around Christmas,
except written by people who share
your interests who happened to be
good at drawing.
All zines mentioned are available at
Gosh! Comics in Soho. Summer Camp’s
LP, Bad Love, is out now.
