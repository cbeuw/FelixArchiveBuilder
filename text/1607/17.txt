(greenbelts, brownpants or grey
collars). As you fight you rank up
allowing you to form a squad, buy
better weapons and influence more
of the battle with radio calls. These
battles happen on about a dozen
maps, which all a very distinctive
feel to them. In terms of gameplay
the game does what it says on the
tin, consisting of you looking down
at your little guy and controlling
him using WASD and your mouse.
You have unlimited ammo, but do
still need to reload once your clip is
empty. There are quite a few different
weapons as well as gimmicks like a
riot shield, that all have a distinctive
feel about them and allow you to
switch up your style according to
how you want to play. Furthermore
there are several types of vehicles for
a quick transport (as well as handy
weapon to run over enemies!)
The art style is really distinctive,
namely because of the fact that it
is really simplistic and cartoony. It
really does set itself apart from other
things around, and definitely will
stand the test of time. This graphical
style also allows it to run comfortably
on most computers for a super
smooth game-play experience.
So now to my personal impression.
When I first started the game up I
decided to skip the tutorial (like I
always do if possible) and jumped
straight into a single-player battle. It
took me a surprisingly little amount
of time (albeit several embarrassing
deaths) to learn the controls and
finally have an impact on the battle.
From the off, rather than feeling
like I was just in some tiny skirmish
I actually really felt like I was in a
battle with hundreds of soldiers,
bullets flying around and tanks
crushing hapless innocents which
I have only really felt in one other
game, Planetside 2. This really drew
me in and it was quite fascinating

Felix Games is back with Max Eggl reviewing indie hit Running with Rifles
Squad, Go Go Go!
Back in yonder days when I
first started playing computer
games, the one that really filled
my childhood after-school hours was
one called Army Men. Basically it
was a shooter revolving around the
green plastic men, where you would
control one of them and shoot the
other plastic dudes using a variety of
guns, grenades and vehicles. Sadly the
graphics of this classic did not stand
the test of time, and I moved on to
bigger and graphically better things.
However, recently in a fit of nostalgia
I decided to look this game up again,
and while doing so came across the
game Running with Rifles on Steam,
made by indie studio Modulaatio
Games. Described as a “tactical top-
down shooter with RPG elements”, I
had found a game that looked eerily
similar to my past passion nd it didn’t
look half bad! After checking out
some videos, I knew I had to get it.
Finally, the end of exams came,
I fired up Steam for the first time
in a long time and spent my hard-
earned cash on this gem. At a measly
£11 I was well prepared to take the
risk that this may be a dud since
most good titles (and notably bad
ones) usually cost a lot more than
this. Furthermore in addition to
the relative cheapness, I was also
pleasantly surprised that this game
also runs on Mac OS (in addition to
Windows and Linux, so no excuses!)
and it seemed that nothing stood in
the way of me jumping straight in!
Well, actually a alcohol fuelled night
(which didn’t end well) forced me to
postpone the playing of this game,
but after overcoming my hangover
the next day I finally managed to take
this baby out for a run and I have to
say that I am not disappointed.
Firstly let me give a bit of a
description of what this game actually
is. You are a soldier thrown into a
variety of battles who is looking to
win the fight for your chosen team,
conflict. The first battle which I
played (which unfortunately we
lost) took about an hour and I was
completely engrossed the entire time.
I also loved the outbursts from the
enemies and allies alike that went
along the lines of “OMG Grenade!”
etc. It definitely was a nice touch and
gave me a chuckle which can never
go amiss! After messing about with
the single-player modes, including
different maps, different game modes
and the single-player campaign I was
really impressed, and I will definitely
be spending more time in the world
of running with rifles.
However, these days only single-
player games rarely make it far, so I
was keen to test out the multi-player
aspect, something I feel like this
game could pull of really well. This
is the one part of the game where I
was not happy. Not really the fault
of the game devs or the game itself,
but there weren’t actually that many
people online to play with. This could
have several factors, for example
namely that it is predominantly
being played by Americans who were
asleep at the time I tried my luck or a
lack of a popular interest. The server
I did try, which had about 10 guys,
really was enjoyable but with the
lack of numbers there was a need for
computer guys, meaning it actually
still felt like a single-player map. Yet,
"I will
definitely
be
spending
more time
in the
world of
running
with rifles."
"After
checking
out some
videos, I
knew I had
to get it."
thinking about it the game just came
out so I am not really worried about
this aspect and definitely hope that
once more people find out about
Running with Rifles more people
will play online leading to a healthy
amount of servers allowing for more
options.
One last pet peeve, which is really
so minor I feel incredibly petty
for mentioning it, is the lack of
steam achievements! I love steam
achievements, as they give me
something to aim for in the game and
gives them some longevity, however
the game devs seem super friendly
and I think this will most likely be a
feature implemented in the future.
All in all I have to say, if you just
finished your exams, are currently
revising or alternatively have
nothing really better to do I would
give this a game a definite look. For
the price you are getting a really fun
and enjoyable experience that will
definitely take you past the 20/30
hour mark. Furthermore it will run
great on almost anything, so you
won’t have to upgrade your rig if its
slightly older. Now I am off, back to
relive the memories of Army men
and make some new ones in Running
with Rifles!
Running with Rifles is currently
available on steam for Windows, Mac
OS X and linux for £10.99.
