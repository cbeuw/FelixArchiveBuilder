Mentality made a number of
recommendations towards the
end of the survey,which they
think would improve the services
available to Imperial students.
One of their biggest
recommendations was that
College should put“students’
mental wellbeing as a strategic
priority over the next five years,”by
committing to more training for
student volunteers and staff alike.
They suggested the College
reviews training already in place
for personal tutors,Hall Wardens
and Hall Seniors,especially when it
comes to understanding anonymity
and confidentiality.
They also recommended that
students in welfare related
volunteer roles within Imperial
College Union receive mental
health first aid training,meaning if
students approach them they can
offer a lot more support.
Mentality specifically
recommended that the college
invest in a partnership with Student
Minds,a student mental health
charity.
Other universities such as UCL
and King’s College London have
already got involved with the
scheme,and trained students to
run peer support groups that other
students can take part in to talk
about their experiences,and share
strategies to help them towards
recovery.
The survey found that although
the Counselling Service waiting
times have improved,extra
provisions should be put in place
during times when more students
are experiencing mental stresses,
such as during exam times.
They also recommended that
“out of hours”support should
be considered,alongside the
introduction of a self-assessment
form that students could fill in
ahead of time to ensure students
are prioritised according to their
immediate need.
Some of the remaining
recommendations are focused
around ease of access to services.
The survey results showed that
there is a high level of awareness
of services available for students
already,which is promising.
However,when asked,students
weren’t engaging with such services
when they were in need.
69% of students did not access
ant of the support services at
Imperial,although
Beth explained that although
people have an idea of who can
help when it comes to welfare
concerns,when the time comes to
actually reach out and find support,
finding specific information could
prove too difficult.“Some people
may find it hard to actually dig out
information,and when someone is
suffering,that can be difficult to do
when the time comes.”
Another recommendation
therefore is to produce a clear
document aimed at signposting
students to relevant services,
alongside clearer information on
the college website and a targeted
section within welcome packs for
first year students.
Said Beth:“We heard from some
students that were unhappy with
the lack of support available on
other campuses,but later found out
that there are provisions at other
locations,its just that students
don’t know about them.
“Making it clearer where students
can go to when they need help
would be beneficial.”
Mentality’s recommendations
to College
various panel discussions discussing
developing student support and
wellbeing services.
During the Mentality presentation,
Andrew Keenan, Education and
Welfare manager of Imperial College
Union, told those at the Welfare
seminar: “Academic difficulty should
not be measured or even correlated
with stress caused. The students who
lead Mentality are aware that any
working environment will have a
level of stress, as I’m sure many staff
around the room can testify to.
“But the ‘good stress’ that keeps
you motivated and produces results
can mutate into the bad stress that
endangers your health and happiness.
We should not defend an overly
stressful curriculum purely by
claiming it is academically necessary.
That is no defence at all.”
Keenan described how there is
a need to eliminate the causes of
such pressures, not just to address
the symptoms. “Too often do we
hear students who have pileups of
coursework deadlines because their
academics have not coordinated with
each other.
“Too often do we hear of
introductory talks at the start of the
year where staff and older students
talk up how scary and terrifying
their workload is. We know there are
projects underway in Chemistry and
other departments to tackle this – we
ask that every department does the
same.”
Wheeler spoke to Felix about
the survey after the seminar. Said
Wheeler: “At Imperial College
Union, we are immensely proud of
the passionate, motivated students
like Bethany who are out to enable
ground-up progressive change for the
student body at Imperial.
“The results that have come from
the work Mentality has done is
sending a clear, irrefutable message to
every level of the institution.
“I am currently working to ensure
that these messages are listened to
and are not ignored.
“The Vice-Provost (Education),
Provost and President of College
are all aware of Mentality’s work,
and from the conversations I’ve had
so far, there is a clear commitment
to working together and taking
collaborative responsibility for the
mental wellbeing of our community.”
Professor Debra Humphris, Vice
Provost (Education), said: “I’m very
grateful to Beth for her work on
leading the Mentality campaign and
producing this helpful report.
“We have a bright, hardworking
and creative student community
at Imperial, and we need to
ensure they’re able to excel - both
academically, and personally. To do
this we need to ensure we are offering
the appropriate services and support,
and fostering a safe environment in
which we can all talk openly about
mental health and wellbeing without
fear of stigma.”
