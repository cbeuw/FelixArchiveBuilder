Kunal Wagle reveals his choices as the Premier League season ends
Premier League: The moments that defined the season
Boring boring Chelsea?
The chant from Arsenal fans rang
around the Emirates in the latter
stages of the dire 0-0 draw between
the Gunners and Chelsea. For Chelsea
manager Jose Mourinho, it was all he
really needed at such a late stage in
the season. Opposition teams voiced
their frustrations at Mourinho’s
tactics but in reality he was doing
a masterful job of marshalling his
troops to get them over the finish
line. Many forget the roaring start
they made to the season, which
allowed them to sit back and defend
in the latter stages. It may be boring,
but my was it effective.
Mike Ashley out of touch?
It says something about the ongoing
soap opera at St James’ Park that
the majority of the neutrals were
probably hoping that Hull City
managed to pull off the great escape
and send the Magpies down to the
Championship. Since Alan Pardew
left (and let’s be honest, this was a
classic example of “be careful what
you wish for”) and John Carver was
hired Newcastle have lunged from
disaster to disaster. This included
a run of eight straight defeats that
transformed Newcastle from a
mid-table club into one teetering
dangerously close to the relegation
zone. They have a lot to address over
the summer if they want to stay in the
league next year.
Should Brendan Rodgers
stay?
Compared to last year, Liverpool
had a poor season. They finished
in sixth place, with an early start
in prospect next season through a
Europa League playoff. Brendan
Rodgers has become the first manager
in recent times to go through three
seasons at Liverpool without winning
any silverware. Last year he was
scathing about Tottenham, saying
that “If you spend £100m, you expect
to be challenging for the league.” This
season Liverpool spent £103m, and
came sixth. Rodgers last year also said
“We won’t do a Tottenham.” I wonder
if he was regretting that statement
when the sixth goal went in last week.
Mark Hughes: Hugely
underrated?
Few will forget Mark Hughes’
horror spell at Queen’s Park Rangers,
where he was sacked in December
without having won a game in the
season. But since then he has taken
the job at Stoke City, and has turned
in some massively impressive results.
This season he led Stoke to their
highest ever finish - ninth - and
they look well placed to make a
Southampton style push for Europe
next year. If they do it, then surely
people won’t be talking about that
year at Queen’s Park Rangers any
more.
Garry Monk: Manager of the
year?
Felix’s Team of the Season vs Felix’s Flops of the Season
Forget Jose Mourinho. Forget Nigel
Pearson. Forget Ronald Koeman.
For me, the manager of the year
has to be Garry Monk. Who could
have thought that former club
captain Monk, who was appointed
late last season as the Swans avoided
relegation, could lead his side to
eighth in his first full season of
management ever? Certainly not
me. This was even after he lost
his best player in Wilfried Bony
in the January transfer window
to Manchester City. He’ll face a
challenge to avoid second season
syndrome next year, but you wouldn’t
bet against him. Not after this season.
Can United mount a title
challenge?
Louis van Gaal achieved his target
for this season, which was to return
to the Champions League. The next
target has to be challenge for the
title, and if he’s going to manage that
next year then he has a lot of work
to do. The first step will be in the
transfer market. Van Gaal’s transfer
dealings from last summer can only
be described as mixed. He had great
success with Ander Herrera, and Luke
Shaw is showing signs of promise.
However the loan move for Radamel
Falcao, and the purchase of Angel
di Maria can’t be ignored. Memphis
Depay is a good start, but van Gaal
will know he has to fix his defence,
and have a solid replacement for
when his star man Michael Carrick is
injured, to mount his challenge. With
his track record, you’d expect it.

It’s that time of year again. The
time when football reporters
scour all the statistics from the
season to decide who goes in their
team of the season. This year, I’ve
decided to come up with not only a
team of the season, but also a team of
“flops” of the season.
In the team of the season on the left
I’ve gone with a Chelsea three at the
back. Some newspapers have come up
with four in defence with Gary Cahill,
but I felt that that would be covered
by the defensive midfielder Nemanja
Matic, who has been instrumental for
the Champions. Cesc Fabregas and
Michael Carrick both missed out on
the PFA team of the year, which I felt
was harsh. They make up the central
midfield. The strikers, Harry Kane
and Sergio Aguero, pick themselves.
The flops was notably harder to
select, mainly because of the number
of strikers who deserved to be in
the team. One person I did consider
including was Steven Gerrard, but it
would be harsh to say that he didn’t
have his moments this season.
