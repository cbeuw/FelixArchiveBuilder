Decide who shapes your student
experience - cast your vote!
This year we are electing Year and Course Representatives, the 16 Ordinary
Members of Council, our Ethics & Environmental Officer and the Graduate
Studentsâ€™ Union committee simultaneously. This is a brilliant way to get involved
and be part of ensuring student views are expressed to the right bodies to make
changes for the benefit of students.
Voting opens 12:00, 19 October and closes
12:00, 23 October.
