Potential pay rise for union bar staff
L
ast Thursday brought the
UN’s HeForShe #GetFree
campaign to Imperial. The
initiative, championed by
Emma Watson and other famous
faces, is doing a university campus
tour across the UK and France. A
#HeForShe branded tourbus rolled
onto campus, outside the SAF
building, where Imperial volunteers
in #HeForShe t-shirts told students
more about the campaign and
encouraged them to sign up.
Later, the union held a panel
discussion on women in honour of
the event, with the UN’s Head of
the initiative, Elizabeth Nyamayaro,
in attendance, as well as Martin
Upton, the head of Imperial’s
Undergrad Medical School, the
graduate admissions manager of a
consulting group and the union’s
own president. The panel was
chaired by Imperial’s Provost, James
Stirling.
HeForShe was launched in 2014
to promote gender equality and
in particular to engage men in the
conversation on women’s rights. So
perhaps the fact that there were
more men on the discussion panel
than women, was not such a bad
thing.
Launched by Emma Watson in
2014, the campain has gone on to
engage with world leaders, actors
and now Imperial students and staff.
This year is proving particularly
promising in terms of female
empowerment, with IC FemSoc
having organised a visit from
Catherine Meyer, co-founder of the
new Women’s Equality Party.Meyer
began the movement with Sandi
Toksvig, and will be discussing
their aims next Wednesday in the
Pippard Lecture Theatre at 6pm.
This is part of FemSoc’s Feminism
Week, the timetable of which is on
page 21.
The HeForShe #GetFree tour will
also stop off at LSE and UCL.

HeForShe hits Imperial
A
t last Monday’s Union
Council meeting, the
question was raised as
to whether the union
should be paying student bar
workers the London Living Wage.
At the moment, student bar staff
are paid the compulsory minimum
wage for adults aged over twenty-
one, regardless of the student’s age;
this is £6.70 an hour. With holiday
pay at 12%, the actual hourly rate
student bar staff recieve is more like
£7.30.
The London Living Wage is
£9.15, and a policy change could
see student pint-pullers getting a
bumper 25% pay rise.
A union insider told FELIX that
since the union funds its activities
on profits made at the bars, if the
London Living Wage was adopted,
either drinks prices would have to be
raised or fewer students employed
in order to avoid making a loss.
It is widely agreed that the national
minimum wage is almost impossible
to live on without subsidy, especially
in London. However, money earnt
from working at union bars is
unlikely to be a student’s only source
of income, since most rely on loans
or grants to support them through
university.
The London Living Wage is
calculated by the Greater London
Authority every year, and is
supposedly the minimum hourly
rate required to survive in London.
This calculation takes into account
increased costs of transport,housing
and other essentials in the capital.

is £7.85, still higher than what
Imperial students are currently paid.
Around 400 companies in London
have signed up to pay their workers
the London Living Wage. It’s a
voluntary scheme, but many large
companies are not on the list, and
it’s estimated that one in four jobs
in London don’t make the cut.
At the end of the discussion at
council, although no concensus was
reached, the Deputy President of
Finance and Services, Chris Kaye,
said he was happy to look into the
issue.
