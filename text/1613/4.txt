Imperial Hub lives to fight another day
I
mperial hub, the volunteering
charity whose relationship
with the union went sour over
the summer, remains in action.
In a statement released after
Freshers Fair, the Hub gang said
they were still committed to
projects they had planned before the
split,including the London Climate
Forum, and Social Innovation
Programme.
The group have launched a
change.org petition, protesting
against the union’s decision to
ditch them. At the time of printing,
the petition had 184 of the 200
signatures it was aiming for.
Organisers told FELIX they plan to
take the petition to the college.
Signatories were invited to leave
comments after signing. One
mourned that “petty arguments
about grant allocation” had led to
the separation, with another saying
they couldn’t “believe that anyone
with the best interests of Imperial’s
student body at heart would have
condoned this decision”.
Unsurprisingly, Hubs had stern
comments on the union’s decision
to hire new staff members in its
Student Development department,
instead of investing in Hubs.“It will
mean starting from scratch,will cost
more and will deliver less”.
In the meantime, the union
staged a ‘volunteering fair’ on
Tuesday in the Great Hall. There
were 500 attendees, just 100 more
than Imperial Hub got in sign-ups
at Freshers Fair, despite not being
allowed a stall, and having some of
their paraphernalia confiscated.
Hubs were, of course, not invited
to attend the volunteering fair, but
have been visible on campus of
late. They are meeting Freshers at
college-run Eastside Bar today for a
meet and greet.

They neglect
to mention
the 45 minute
travel time to
university
The METRO covers Imperial halls
I
mperial’s new North Acton
halls graced page 19 of free
daily newspaper METRO this
week. In a short article, that
could have come straight from an
accomodation leaflet provided by
Imperial itself,the paper’s ‘consumer
business editor’ described the halls
as a “student skyscraper”, boasting
of futuristic amenities like the film
screening area, kitchens with stone
worktops and flat screen TVs.
A whole paragraph was dedicated
to the paint on the bedroom walls.
Dulux colours apparently, rather
than the “usual white”.
The article did, however, neglect
to mention the 45 minute commute
necessary to reach Imperial or the
fact that the building had been
nominated by a local resident for the
‘Carbuncle Cup’,a ‘prize’awarded to
the year’s ugliest building.
Named after Joan Woodward,
Imperial’s second ever female chair,
the halls have been controversial
to say the least, with the union
backing an ‘#againstacton’campaign
protesting the college investing in
halls so far from campus.
One victory of the campaign was
the reduction of Woodward room
prices. Starting at £92 per week
and rising to a lofty £142, the rent
is nothing compared to Beit (£216
for an en-suite single) or recently
hiked Eastside rents (up to £262 for
a premium ensuite).
With the closure of Evelyn
Gardens and Weeks halls (and the
former re-opened at the last minute
two weeks before term started) came
a need to house several hundred
students.The college prides itself on
offering all Freshers accomodation,
and Woodward’s 600 or so beds
allow this.
The North Acton halls had their
‘official launch’ on Wednesday,
despite the fact that hundreds of
students moved in several weeks
ago. The event was attended by the
usual big names in college. About as
far as possible from her predecessor’s
#AgainstActon campaign, the
union president was in attendance,
unveiling a ceremonial plaque.There
was some confusion when students
were given restricted access to their
halls during the event, begging
the question why this wasn’t done
before students moved in.
FELIX has also heard that some
rooms directly overlook next door’s
graveyard. Since this is against
several faiths’ practices, rooms on
the non-graveyard side have been
kept empty in case there were
complaints.
