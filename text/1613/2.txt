H
ey there! First of all,
a big thank you to all
the gems who came
down to our social on
Monday. You ate pizza, you shared
ideas and best of all you lined up in
a little queue at the end to ask me
questions, which made me feel bare
special. But seriously, it was great to
know that so many people want to
get involved with FELIX this year.
I’ve had loads of you wandering
down to the office to say “hi” (West
basement of Beit btw). We like that
too!
My favourite comment from that
event, although I liked them all, was
about how much swearing there was
in the paper. Yeah, my mum can’t
quite believe it either. This mainly
comes from me,as most of the other
members of the editorial team are
quite charming. Except Hangman.
My old school friend used to say
a perpetual potty mouth was her
way of being honest and genuine. I
like to think we have that kind of
vibe here at FELIX. Writing for us
ain’t your degree, and it’s certainly
not work. It’s a creative outlet, when
arguably you don’t have many in
your day to day (unless you’re that

dude who plays acoustic guitar in
halls – and arguably, continuously
playing Wonderwall isn’t creative)
and we’re not going to limit your
language. TL;DR: swear lots, sorry
mum, write for us.
Talking of swear-y rage, the
Angry Grad is back this week,
and every week ‘til we all leave this
place. She’s graduating, as a load of
us are, in the Royal flaming Albert
Hall on Monday. It’s not the only
reason I came here, but it is quite
a lot of the reasons. This week I’ve
had to stifle fears of falling over on
stage whilst collecting my degree,
in order to make a newspaper.
Angry Grad rightfully points out
that despite the fact that it’s a day
where the focus is on your academic
excellence, the only thing you’re
really concentrating on is getting
that like-worthy picture of yourself
looking like a solid 8.
Talking of sassy women, we have
an article on Ada Lovelace, who
if you didn’t know, was one of the
coolest computer programming
women to have existed, as well as
the first. She did this alongside
being a habitual gambler, having
loads of affairs, and being smarter
than most of the dudes around her.
Sassy or not, it’s not too late for
you to get involved (spoiler: I’m
going to say that every week). I got
sent some super cool articles out
of the blue this week, which is like
christmas morning in my inbox.
I’ve appointed a load of new section
editors, and everybody’s getting
trained up. You can do it too!
Whatever you fancy, illustrating,
taking pictures, writing - just pop
me an email at felix@imperial.ac.uk.
We’d love to have you, and I don’t
say that to everyone.
