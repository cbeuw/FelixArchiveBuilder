South Africa vs Wales
Saturday 16:00, Twickenham
This should be an excellent game,
and has the potential to be the best
quarter-final. South Africa have
the history, having only lost once
to Wales since 2000, but are South
Africa still the team of old? Their
loss to Japan would suggest not.
After that initial setback they have
improved considerably, but I haven’t
yet seen a full 80 minutes of them
playing their best.
Wales have had an incredible
number of injures to deal with, and
couldn’t get through Australia’s
defence in their last game. Both
sides have game winners and
good packs. For Wales to win they
probably need to get an early lead
and channel the spirit they showed
in their game against England.
South Africa need to be superior
in the physical battle and their
young players need to perform,
while being led by some of the more
experienced players. I think South
Africa will win.
New Zealand vs France
Saturday 20:00, Cardiff
These two teams have a history
when it comes to Rugby World
Cup meetings. This will be a repeat
of the 2011 final, when New
Zealand secured victory on home
soil. However, the Millennium
Stadium in Cardiff will hold better
memories for France, who toppled
the mighty All Blacks there in the
2007 quarter-final. New Zealand
are favourites, looked slightly shaky
in their group stage games.
France were playing well until
their convincing defeat to Ireland,
but definitely have the pack and
attacking threat needed to be able
to beat New Zealand.
My prediction is that New
Zealand will win a close game,
pulling away as France tires towards
the end.They have many individuals
capable of moments of brilliance,
and if Milner-Skudder and Sonny

Bill Williams have a good game
they should win. Having said that,
if France manage to get an early
lead New Zealand could crumble,
as they did in 2007.
Ireland vs Argentina
Sunday 13:00, Cardiff
Ireland might have avoided New
Zealand by beating France, but
Argentina is still a tough opponent.
The fans expect a victory after so
many World Cup disappointments,
but that doesn’t mean they’ll get it.
Argentina have a very good chance
of winning this game. They are a
hard team to judge, beating South
Africa just before the tournament,
and playing well in their defeat to
New Zealand. In addition, they
thoroughly dispatched the other
teams in their group, but they have
played very little rugby against the
Northern Hemisphere teams.
Ireland also suffered significant
injuries, with captain Paul
O’Connell out of the remaining
games. If Sexton is able to play or
even be on the bench it will be a
massive boost for Ireland.Argentina
haven’t suffered badly from injuries,
and their whole team looks
impressive. Although my heart says
Ireland,my head says Argentina will
win and break Irish hearts again.The
teams are very evenly matched and
it will be important for both teams
to not fall too far behind, as neither
team has been in that situation so
far. I’m struggling to come up with
a prediction for this game. In fact,
I don’t think I can even tell if the
final score line will be close. Yes, I’m
aware that that is a cop out.
Australia vs Scotland
Sunday 16:00, Twickenham
Australia should win this easily.
They looked very good when playing
against top opposition, whereas
Scotland have only really impressed
against a tired Japan and the USA.
Australia should have the advantage
in the scrum, and in my opinion
their back row has been the best in
this World Cup so far. Australian
Fly-Half Bernard Foley has not
shone so far, but is also incredibly

reliable, and Australia have the
advantage in attack. For Scotland
to win, they would need to have one
New Zealand face a tough rematch against France in Cardiff on Saturday night. Photo Credit: David Rogers/Getty Images
With the group stages over, we
preview the business end of
rugby’s flagship event
of their best games in decades, and
have Australia under-perform. The
odds are heavily stacked against
either of those happening this
weekend.
