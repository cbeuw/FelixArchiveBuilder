THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FRIDAY 16th

I
t’s the time of year where,
having just got back to uni,
most of us (especially Freshers)
are seeking to let loose and just
have fun, partying and clubbing the
nights away while figuring out how
lectures work during the day. While
this is indeed the age-old student
lifestyle,some aspects of it can prove
challenging.
All the social interaction, often in
loud, crowded spaces with flashing
lights and alcohol, can feel very
overwhelming and sometimes
lead to overstimulation or panic
attacks. For those unfamiliar with
it, overstimulation (also known as
sensory overload),and panic attacks,
while separate experiences,generally
involve becoming overwhelmed
by intense overlapping sensory
stimuli, and can cause the person
experiencing them to become
unresponsive, hyperventilate
and freeze up, or shake violently.
Everyone’s responses are different,
but in general it is an unpleasant
and unsettling experience, after
which lots of self-care and calm is
needed.
It can be hard to accept that certain
situations, even ones in which you
may want to involve yourself, may
make you have that response. It
can also be hard to understand if
you haven’t experienced it yourself,
but the key is to try not to become
annoyed with yourself or others
for finding such atmospheres
difficult. We are all different, and
some of us just don’t mesh with the
stereotypical student atmosphere
and lifestyle. And that is okay.
Anyone who says differently isn’t
worth having around you.
To deal with my own social
anxiety, I make sure I know most
of the people I’ll be with in the
crowded space, ensure that I have
a swift retreat if needed, and will
leave as soon as I feel it getting a
little too much. As the saying goes,
“Those who matter don’t mind, and
those who mind really don’t matter”.
If you can, try to tell or bring a
friend who can help you get out of
the space if you need to; for some
people, if overstimulation gets too
bad, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to speak.
Often,though,writing or typing is
much less difficult,so consider using
‘Emergency Chat’, a smartphone
app that provides two-way text
communication on a single phone.
Originally designed for specific
cases of someone who experiences
‘overstimulation’ as a part of an
Asperger’s sympton diagnosis, it
has the capacity to help in the case
of panic attacks, overstimulation or
claustrophobia.
Friendly faces and crowded spaces
How to manage social anxiety when things get overwhelming
Another app, ‘SAMApp’, has lots
of exercises to help get through or
potentially fend off a panic attack.
While these are good contingency
techniques and can help handle the
situation, it is equally good to use
the technique phrased by one of my
friends as ‘flee, flee, run away’. If you
feel like you are not up to dealing
with contingency planning and
attempting to cope with crowds for
the sake of stereotypical socialising,
know that it is completely okay to
simply avoid the situation.Choosing
the time and way you interact with
your friends is absolutely okay,and it
is often far more pleasant to interact
with friends in a environment that’s
comfortable for you.
If you have a friend who has told
you they suffer from social anxiety,
panic attacks or overstimulation
then it can be tricky to know what
you can do to help. From my own
experience, the most helpful things
can be simply listening to what they
ask and have to say, giving them
space when needed and reassuring
them that or wanting to leave a
situation is completely okay. Simply
being there for them and letting
them know that it’s okay to feel that
way means a great deal.
If you are experiencing any social anxiety, friends can be there to support you. Photo Credit: Newscast Online
