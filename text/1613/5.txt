hand. Sounds fun doesn’t it?
But screw what your ‘rents think,
I’m worried for myself. Am I the
only one who has NO IDEA what
If I fail at
looking
peng on
graduation
day, I may
as well
have failed
my fucking
degree

the day actually entails? Yes, I realise
it’s going to be duller than Piers
Morgan’s Life Stories, but I still
need more details! Do we swear our
souls to Imperial in Latin, meaning
we’re bound to donate 10% of our
future salaries to college? Do we
smear our blood across some ancient
college relic, like the plethora of
alumni before us, so we are now
blood bound to Imperial? Do I lose
my right to graduate if I fall over
on stage? These are all extremely
important questions, which are
keeping me awake at night.The fact
that college hasn’t clarified any of
these pressing enquires for me (not
that I’ve asked, but seeing as they
pride themselves on being a top
institution, they should really pre-
empt), means I’m literally walking
into a minefield, blind. Yes, literally.
Secondly, I can’t be arsed to see
90% of my course mates again.
No, I’m not being a miserable
git, but I just cannae be arsed. If I
wanted to be fully aware of how I’m
currently doing absolutely nothing
with my life, then I’d read Malala’s
autobiography. I don’t want to hear
toss pot keen-o bragging about his
city job he landed through nepotism.
Nor do I give a shit on how ground
breaking your masters is, Mr “not
getting onto a grad-scheme was
the best thing that ever happened
to me,” because that decision was
a panic life move. But mainly, I
just don’t want my parents to meet
my more successful acquaintances
(they stopped being friends since
they left me alone on my ship of
unemployment).I’m just worried my
mum will realise how un-Imperial a
grad I am. I’m terrified she’s going
to stop doing my washing in order
to give me the kick up the backside
I need to go get a proper job, so this
gap yah doesn’t turn into a gap life.
Lastly, let’s face it. Whether you
smashed that degree with a 1st, or
scraped that 3rd, the only thing on
people’s minds on graduation day,
are the photo opportunities. I’m
so worried I’m going to look more
Voldemort’s secret than Victoria’s;
those three/four/six years boil
down to that one photo; tying the
odd objects on the mantelpiece
together. If I fail at looking peng on
graduation day, I may as well have
failed my fucking degree.

W
hat up Gs? And
by Gs I mean
grads, because
this comment is
dedicated to my fellow class of
2015. We did it y’all! We gruelled,
we grafted and we threw outright
tantrums like an un-expecting baby
daddy (pulling out is stupid, you
deserve it).
Imperial may have worked us
hard enough to violate a few
human rights laws, but no cretin
can compete with the quality of
our degrees. Apart from those “I’m
so overworked, with my eight week
terms and champagne flowing”
Oxbridge morons. Oh, I’m not
bitter, promise, it’s been three years
since that day where confidence in
my intellect was knocked, my heart
was shattered, and my dreams of
walking through the cloisters like
I’m Harry ruddy Potter were swept
from under my feet. I’m totally
fucking over it, yeah? I’m sure you
are too, so stop bringing it up.
Tangent noted, back on topic.
With graduation day round the
corner,let me highlight to y’all a few
of my woes, which I have no doubt
you share.
So you’ve worked hard, and if
you’re a medic, played harder. You
deserve this day. It’s all about you.
You picture yourself ascending the
steps of the Royal Albert Hall,
your gown billowing in the wind,
turning your head back so your
mum, swelling with pride, can take
a manufactured candid shot for you
to post on insta later (#graduated
#aboutfuckingtime). But what’s
that distant wailing sound? That
my friend, is the noise of your bank
balance experiencing violation, as
you remember you only spent in
excess of a 200 quid for this day. £35
per bloody ticket,which your family,
who,let’s face it,are obligated to buy
so they can sit through two hours
of international after international
sounding name (I’m Asian, thus
this is not racist) just to witness your
attempt not to tumble across stage
and shake some unknown prof’s
From graduand to graduate, and you only have to pay £45 for the honour
