I
f you’re anything like me,
you probably spent your
Tuesday night tending to your
extensive collection of potted
plants (yup, standard weeknight
fun). This Tuesday though, we all
had the opportunity to celebrate the
rapid expansion of science and the
women that have pioneered in that
field.
Indeed, this Tuesday we entered
the sixth year of celebrating Ada
Lovelace Day – a date dedicated to
commemorating the extraordinary
achievements of women in Science,
Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM).
If by this point you’re awkwardly
scratching your head wondering
“Who on earth is Ada Lovelace?”,
fear not! I have put my honed
research skills to use and am willing
to provide you with an answer, but
only after I’ve scornfully stared you
down and muttered something
insulting under my breath.
So who was Ada? Only a woman
trying to leave her mark during the
male-dominated Victorian era. Oh,
and also the first programmer.
Originally born Ada Gordon in
1815, she was the only legitimate
child of the poet George Gordon
Byron, more commonly known as
Lord Byron. Soon after Ada’s birth,
Lord Byron separated from Ada’s
mother, who he’d only married for
the money (plot twist!), left Britain,
and eventually perished during the
Greek War of Independence. The
bitterness (who’d have thought that
was the key ingredient to raising a
genius) of the separation ended up
playing a fundamental role in Ada’s
upbringing,as mother Anne Isabella
Noel, in an effort to suppress the
creative “insanity’’ that she believed
characterised Ada’s father, infused
her daughter’s childhood with
strong doses of science, logic and
mathematics.
But Ada ended up being so much
more than just her heritage.In 1833,
shewasintroducedtointernationally
acclaimed mathematician Charles
Babbage and ended up developing
a long-lasting friendship with
him. She was captivated by the
Analytical Engine he had designed
and, in 1844, contributed extensive
notes on its nature. Her humbly
titled ‘Notes’ (twice as extensive as
the original article they were based
on) contained algorithms that are
now regarded as the first computer
programs, as well as contemplations
on the true potential of the
Analytical Engine, extending to its
capability of producing music (yes,
she predicted Spotify, kind of).
Despite Babbage being the
designer of the Analytical Engine,
Ada’s understanding of the machine
and its capabilities, far surpassed
those of its creator’s. Ada died
at the age of 36 only eight years
after the publication of her notes,
but not before managing to attain
notoriety, with scandals including
a failed attempt at formulating
a mathematical model to ensure
gambling success. I told you she was
a badass.
Today we celebrate the 13th
of
October as Ada Lovelace Day, in
honour of not only Ada, but all
women in STEM who, despite
the obstacles they’ve faced, have
managed to pierce through the veil
of inequality permeating our world
and still selflessly dedicate their life
to expanding the island of human
knowledge.

An Ode to Ada
In honour of Ada Lovelace Day, FELIX takes a look at the Victorian programmer,
gambler and all-round badass
Franklin, who was often patronised
and called a fool despite her catalytic
role in the discovery of the DNA’s
double helix structure.
Women who sacrificed their
lives for their science, such as Irène
Curie-Joliot, who like her mother
Marie, earned a Nobel Prize in
chemistry and paid the ultimate
price for her achievements, dying
due to exposure to radiation.
These are women who managed
to accomplish amazing scientific
feats despite facing a discouraging
environment deterring them from
following science; who refused to
conform to the era’s social norms
and were smart, imaginative, and
innovative whilst doing so; who
decided to play with maths, science,
technology and engineering.
If you forgot to celebrate the
200 year long fight for equality in
STEM representation, worry not,
for there’s still time. You can visit
the Science Museum every Friday
evening for the next three weeks
(16th
- 30th
of October) for a series
of events aimed at deconstructing
the life of Ada, while having drinks
with writers, designers, scientists,
mathematicians and musicians.
Or, just recognise the contribution
of women, not only in STEM
but across the social fabric and
appreciate the challenges they still
face today.
Let’s all drink to Ada Lovelace,
one of the first, but certainly not
last, mothers of science.

up being so
much more
than just her
heritage
