ELIX: Could you tell us a
little bit about yourself and
your career?
Julia Higgins: I studied
Physics as an undergraduate, before
doing a DPhil in Chemistry. After
that, I taught Physics in a school
for two years and then spent three
years at a joint French-German-
British nuclear reactor in Grenoble,
doing research using neutron beams
to investigate materials – mainly
polymers. After that I was recruited
to Imperial as a lecturer, and have
been here ever since. That was back
in 1976, and I’ve never worked
anywhere else, apart from a few
sabbaticals.Whilst at Imperial,I was
Dean of City and Guilds College
– (now the role is called Consul
and City and Guilds is part of the
Engineering faculty) I stood in as
Head of Department in Chemical
Engineering for a year, and then
became Principal (now Dean) of
the Faculty of Engineering during
my last full-time year. I’ve also
been President of the Institute of
Chemical Engineering.
FELIX:That’s quite an impressive
track record. So you’ve mentioned
that you’ve been doing neutron
research – could you tell me a little
more about that?
JH: I look at polymers using
neutron beams. So polymers are
long-chain molecules and are
obviously full of hydrogen, and it
turns out that neutrons interact
with normal hydrogen differently
than they interact with deuterium.
It’s a bit like how hydrogen and
deuterium produce different
NMR signatures; except that here
I’m looking at scattering, that
is, molecule shapes, rather than
movements.Think of it as something
akin to Raman spectroscopy (where
photons bounce off molecular bonds
and gain or lose energy),except here
we’re looking at neutrons and nuclei
rather than photons and bonds.
This was a really exciting field to
go into back then – no one had done
the basic research, in fact controlled
synthesis of polymers itself was a
new area of organic synthesis that
only emerged after the war. We
didn’t know how these long polymer
molecules behaved. We knew that
in a lump of plastic there was no
defined crystal structure, but not
much more than that. By mixing
polymer molecules containing
different amounts of hydrogen and
deuterium, we could examine how
they moved.
Eventually, it was realised that
these molecules were moving like
snakes do: following their own
contours. I had the opportunity to
work with Pierre-Gilles de Gennes
[winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in
Physics] a little bit,who was working
on a mathematical description of
this motion.Whilst doing a postdoc
in Manchester before going to
France I had beenintroduced to
Sir Sam Edwards. Sir Sam was a
very important in my life, and was
actually the person who nominated
me for fellowship of the Royal
Society.
FELIX: What about your time as
President as the Board of Trustees
of the Union?
JH: When I was first asked to do
this, I really had no idea about how
the Union was run.They hadn’t long
had a new constitution and Board
of Trustees, and I spent a couple of
years feeling very confused. Then I
realised that it wasn’t just me – the
Union itself was a bit disorganised
managerially, and the new structure
was really feeling its way. But since
then, things have been transformed
for the better by new staff and a
series of excellent officers. I can’t
take much credit for this, what I did
mostly was calming down people
who were rather upset in meetings!
FELIX: And as I understand it,
your time on that board is coming
to an end – how did you end up
becoming IOP President-elect?
JH: Well, I knew that my time at
the Union was coming to an end,
which meant that there was a bit
of workload reduction there. I was
also coming to the end of my time
on the Royal Society’s Education
Board, and in December I got a
call asking if I might be interested
in taking up the role. I was the
‘Council Candidate’, if you like – no
one else was proposed, so there was
no election. I’ll be the President-
elect for two years, and then the
President for another two.It should
be a bit easier than it was with the
Union, as I’ll have more idea what
I’m doing when I take over.
FELIX: Have you got any exciting
plans for your time at the IOP?
JH: Well, one of the big things
will be our move to a new building
in King’s Cross from our one in
Portland Place. Making a successful
transition to this new building is
important: it’ll be more spacious,
and there should be more room
for outward-facing exhibitions, like
they have at the headquarters of the
Wellcome Trust.
I also want to try and work on
getting more people studying
Physics, and getting ‘physicist’
accepted as a profession.There aren’t
enough boys studying it at A-level,
let alone girls! I want to make sure
that there is sufficient awareness of
what you can do after university.
We also need to make sure that we
are relevant to young people at the
beginning of their careers.
One other thing is supporting
teachers who want to do more
experiments in their lessons. The
French Academy of Sciences have
a great project that they have been
running for twenty years now, that
produces hands-on resources for use
by students. The focus is on making
sure that teachers feel they have the
support they need when it comes to
doing experiments, and that they
feel that they are part of the scientific
community. When I was a teacher
I never really felt like I was part of
this community, and I want to make
sure that teachers are embraced by
everyone. At the moment they seem
to be a group who often get bashed
around by governments – of either
political persuasion.
FELIX: What about the
upcoming referendum on Britain’s
membership of the European
Union – does this worry you at all?
JH: Well, science is an
international endeavour and there’s
a huge European community doing
science – there was even when
European nations were at war with
each other. There’s a famous story
about Captain Cook being allowed
to sail to the Southern hemisphere
to observe the Transit of Venus in
1769 by the French, even though
they were at war with Britain.
Whether we are part of Europe or
Julia Higgins is kind of a big deal

not,science will go on.Being part of
the EU is manifestly not necessary
for doing good science, and there
are a number of highly successful
institutions that exist outside of, or
even predate the EU like CERN and
the ESA. However, I personally am
very strongly pro-EU. The country
would look a bit silly stuck on the
edge of Europe without being part
of it, and it’s clearly easier to limit
the power of Brussels from inside
rather than outside.
Science is a global endeavour,
but it’s also strongly European;
and within that the UK gets more
money from the European Research
Council than any other country in
Europe. One would not wish to
make any move to lose that, but to
be honest I’m more worried about
what would happen if Scotland
were to leave the UK.
FELIX: So finally, would you
describe yourself as a chemist or a
physicist?
JH: I want to emphasise that
I’ve come full circle, from Physics
through Chemistry to Physics. I
believe I think like a physicist. In
fact, I disliked Chemistry at school
so I daren’t describe myself as a
chemist. I still have a huge gap in
my chemistry knowledge when it
comes to organic chemistry. I also
have to be careful not to describe
myself as an engineer – I think
I have a different way of looking
at problems to my colleagues in
Engineering though we collaborate
very well – perhaps for that reason!
FELIX: Well, thank you, and best
of luck with the new job!
