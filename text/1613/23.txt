CANCER
VIRGO
This week you are a meerkat
keeper at a popular zoo,
dating a llama handler
from work. You get into an
argument with the llama
handler’s ex, a monkey expert
at the same zoo, and end up
in court.
Sometimes you just can’t
make this crap up.

This week you email
Hangman to let them know
that the deuterated solvents
have arrived in the Chemistry
Department.
Why? Why would you email
Hangman with this news?
We don’t understand.
This week you are the other
fish.
Shut up.
This week you hear news of
royalty making an appearence
on campus. Convinced that
this is code for your Queen,
Beyoncé, visiting Imperial,
you work yourself into a
frenzy of excitement.
You find out that ‘royalty’
actually means ‘Duke of
York’.
This week you notice that
the horoscopes are even
worse than they usually are.
Hangman’s tired, alright. It’s
been a long week.
Send better ones to
hangman@imperial.ac.uk. You
were told to do this this last
week and you didn’t,so you’ve
only got yourselves to blame.
This week while playing
touch rugby,you knock a ten-
year-old to the ground when
they try to tackle you. When
asked to apologise, you point
out that children are a bunch
of little shits who deserve
the occasional crash tackle.
You are met with universal
acclaim.
This week you are asked to
provide set dressing for a
popular TV show. You take
advantage of the producers’
illiteracy to write obscene
messages on the set insulting
the show and calling the
producers wankers. You are
never hired to work on Blue
Peter again.
This week you attend your
first sports night with your
new friends in [Insert
Relevant Sports Team Here].
You begin to feel the alcohol’s
effects after the first couple
of pints, but determined to
appear cool you plough on.
You wake up in a Union
toilet. How unpleasant.
This week you finally give in
and try one of the Union’s
new pizzas. As expected, it is
a really quite disappointing.
You take some comfort in
knowing that no one will be
able to vote for Chris Kaye
next year,and he won’t be able
to fool you with promises of
decent food ever again.
This week you are shocked
to discover that the Arctic
Monkey’s “I Bet You Look
Good on Dancefloor” is ten
years old. This, unlike all
of the birthdays that have
passed since its release,finally
makes you feel old.Ten years,
man. That’s a decade since
they lost that bet.
This week you decide that
you are done with supporting
England in sporting events,
and that you need to find a
team that won’t constantly
disappoint you in every sport.
You switch alleigance to your
backup team, 6784-time
Rugby and Football World
Champions, North Korea.
This week you finally recover
from your Freshers’ Week
hangover and discover that
you have already alienated
everyone in your halls and
on your course with your
drunken twattery.
Don’t worry, these are the
first steps along the road to
becoming Hangman.
HOROSCOPES
H
angman thought long
and hard about what
to write this week.
We spit-balled a
whole bunch of ‘Just the Tips’ ideas
in the FELIX office, until we got
told to stop throwing chewed-up
wads of paper around and actually
get on with writing the damn paper.
Concepts such as ‘Hangman’s
Guide to Politics’ were bandied
around,until it was pointed out that
anything like that could conceivably
be considered an actual article, and
so wouldn’t be fit for the Hangman
section.
This is meant to be the satire/
comedy section of the paper, after
all.
However, since the (Google)
definition of satire is “the use of
humour, irony, exaggeration, or
ridicule to expose and criticize
people’s stupidity or vices,
particularly in the context of
contemporary politics and other
topical issues”, we’re actually
not sure we qualify for that title.
“Contemporary politics and other
topical issues” isn’t really our thing.
After some further digressions
that were slightly less existential
in nature, Hangman eventually
had the genius idea that we could
just write an article about writing
articles! Aren’t we clever?
No,that wasn’t sarcastic,please tell
us we’re clever. We crave validation.
So, in keeping with the spirit of
the FELIX social that apparently
happened this week (Hangman
didn’t go, we were too busy hating
everything), consider this your
guide into how to write nonsensical
piles of garbage with pretensions of
being published material.
Fortunately for Hangman’s work
ethic, all of that preceeding waffle
counts as a description of how we
write articles! Isn’t that great?
We’ll probably stop with the
rhetorical questions now (although
we do still crave validation), but
that’s more because we’re starting
to run out of space for this column.
We know exactly what we’re doing,
honest.
Once we’ve settled on an idea for
what words we could spew onto a
page in an unending stream of word
vomit, we proceed to do exactly that
- just throw words at a page to see
what sticks. Once we’ve filled out
the page, the whole things gets put
in front of the boss to disapprove of.
If you’ve got ideas for articles you
could do better than us, drop a line
to hangman@imperial.ac.uk. Please.
We’re getting tired of asking.
