CU Feminist Society has a
vision for Imperial College.
We want to see a campus
where people of all gender
identities are treated equally, a place
where we are all free to pursue those
things that interest us, free to learn,
and free to grow.
From Monday, we’re hosting a
feminism week! There will be talks,
socials and external events.
The week includes talks from
organisations such as Ladies Come
First (Tuesday 20th
), the Women’s
Equality Party (Wednesday 21st
)
and London Young Feminists
(Thursday 22nd
).
Tuesday
We have Sophie Holloway, the
Co-Founder of Ladies Come First
speaking about Pleasure Positive
Activism. Sophie is passionate
about pleasure and female pleasure
in particular.
Wednesday
Wednesday is looking very
exciting with a talk from co-founder
and president of the Women’s
Equality party, Catherine Mayer.
Catherine will be talking about the
aims of the Women’s Equality party,
which she founded in March this
year with Sandi Toksvig.
Thursday
Young Feminists London is a
fantastic organisation which unites
and empowers feminists. Amanda
Lundstedt, co-founder of the
organisation will be delving into
her path to feminism and the broad
bracket that feminism contains,
from intersectionality to radical
feminism.
Friday
This leaves the weekend
for socialising! Friday will be
casual drinks and discussion in
FiveSixEight around 6pm, an
opportunity to exchange opinions
and ideas on the week’s talks.
Weekend
On the 24th
and 25th
October we
have the Feminism in London
Conference, for which we will be
selling tickets to the evening party,
featuring a panoply of award-
winning feminist comedians and
musicians.
This week will be a taster of what

Editor-in-Chief
This week, we interviewed the club-
and-society-obsessed and totally
gorge Ben,your union representative
for clubs and societies.We asked, he
answered.He also made us do situps
while we did it.
FELIX: Ben, what is you do all
day?
Ben: A lot of emails! I spend a lot
of time helping clubs and societies
out with their events,finance,or just
general admin.But I’m also working
on improving the systems we use –
like eActivities and the way that
clubs get access to funding from the
Union, College and elsewhere.
There are a few Big Things. We’re
reviewing Student Development,
and working with Sport Imperial to
write a new sports strategy for the
College.
FELIX: How much do you love
clubs and societies? As much as the
national anthem, or less than The
Great British Bake Off?
Ben: To quote my favourite
children’s book, “to the moon and
back”. And if Vehicle Design have
their way and get a cubesat built, at
least to space.
All seriousness, I can honestly
say that clubs and societies were
my favourite thing about Imperial
while I was studying. They teach
you lots! Some things you didn’t
even know you didn’t know. We do
a bunch of stuff (there’s a statistic
about that), and it’s really easy to
start new things.
FELIX: Ben, if students want to
set up a new club, how can they go
about that?
Ben: First thing is to contact me
or India, the staff member who
looks after the new clubs. Then
there is a quick form to fill out so
we know you’ve thought it through,
have plans, a budget etc. You’ll meet
with the New Activities Committee
– about five or six students from
different club backgrounds, and
then we’ll put you into the New
Activities Incubator. That’s a thing
we use to offer you some more
support as you get started, and it’s
set up so you should become a full
club within a term of going in.
FELIX: Ben, what about if
someone’s having trouble with a
club they run? Who they gonna
call?
Ben: It depends! We’ve got so
many clubs that there are quite
a few staff for different things.
But anybody out of me, Chris,
the Deputy President (Finance &
Services), or the Student Activities
Team should be able to give them
an answer – or be able to find one
within a few days.
Every club who comes to one of
our induction sessions meets a staff
member who’s their assigned contact
for the year ahead and can help with
any query – finance,democracy,how
to make a claim.
FELIX: Oh, okay, I thought you
might say Ghostbusters. Finally, why
are you making me do situps while I
conduct this interview?
Ben: It’s important to do situps
whenever you interview. It helps the
flow of questions by making sure
you have to break every so often.
Besides, otherwise I’d be lonely.
Super awkward to be doing situps
by yourself when you’re chatting to
someone.
