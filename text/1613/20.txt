BUSINESS
B
ack in June, Twitter
CEO Dick Costolo (@
dickc) tweeted: “Welcome
back, @jack !!”. He was
referring to Jack Dorsey, one of
the co-founders of Twitter. This
enigmatic tweet, short even by
Twitter standards, signalled to those
in the know that Dick Costolo had
stepped down as CEO of the micro-
blogging giant with former CEO
Jack Dorsey to return as interim
boss.
Last week Dorsey was appointed
permanent CEO and took to
Twitter himself, announcing the
news with the obtuse: “Hello! We
have some news to share!” followed
by thirteen tweets covering business
plans, plugs for his other company
(Square, a mobile payments
company) and the importance of
free speech. Having been side-lined
as CEO in 2008 for the technical
issues the site was experiencing, Mr
Dorsey is returning to the helm of
a technically competent company
but one that is struggling to reach
profitability.
The challenges Dorsey will face
were best expressed not by him,
however, but by his predecessor. Mr
Costolo, announcing his departure
from the board of Twitter, tweeted
a five-point list regarding the
company. Along with paying lip
service to Dorsey, he sinisterly
commented that “those banging
pots and pans outside Twitter know
the least about what’s going on
inside Twitter”.
The “pots and pans” are being
wielded by the legions of investors
dissatisfied with the company’s
performance since its blockbuster
IPO in November 2013. After
soaring to a high of $73.71 in
December 2013, shares slipped to
a mere $30.85 by May 2014 and
have been stuck in the doldrums
ever since. The case made against
Twitter by its critics is simple: there
is no overarching strategy in place
to take the firm forward. Investors,
anxious about the firm’s inability to
make a profit, rightly want to know
whether the company can turn itself
around. The tweets of the current
and former CEOs reveal much
about why the firm will struggle to
live up to its initial, extraordinary
hype.
Consider first Dorsey’s
messages. Following his official
re-appointment last week he
wanted to discuss his vision of
the future. Constrained by his
medium, however, he was forced
to break down his case into ugly
140 character soundbites. Costolo,
similarly, had to use five tweets
to convey his none-too-complex
thoughts.
Such misappropriation of the
medium, writing paragraphs of text
as multiple tweets, goes right to
the heart of Twitter’s problem. The
concept was born nearly ten years
ago as a way of making haiku-esque
text messages public. It was not
built as a business. Like Facebook,
initial excitement centred on its
staggering growth: build the user
base first, monetise it later. Unlike
platforms like Facebook, Twitter
constrained itself severely with its
unique selling point, the tweet.
This uniqueness has propelled
the word tweet into the dictionary
and the zeitgeist but is now acting
as a drag on user base growth,
shown by the prolonged plateau
in monthly active users (Twitter’s
preferred metric of success).Twitter
has primarily relied on a small
fraction of users clicking on paid
advertisements (much like Google)
to make it money. If the number of
users is constant and the revenue
you are making today doesn’t offset
your costs then there is an obvious
problem.
To deal with this issue Twitter
has two choices. It can increase
the money it makes off its users or
increase user base. The first route is
a dangerous path for companies that
offer esoteric services like Twitter;
obtrusive adverts or shameless
money-making ploys will simply
push users onto other platforms.
Other attempts to bolt on money-
making services in the past have
equally failed, for example a
payment system called TwitPay was
quietly sold for a mere $100,000 in
2010.
Alternatively, Twitter can increase
the number of active users. To
that end Mr. Dorsey announced
last week a new feature in Twitter:
moments. These are smartly linked
up tweets, pictures and videos
gathered under headings like recent
sports events and the like. Would-
be users, put off by the difficulty of
finding interesting tweets amongst
the dross will instead read tweets
within these Moments. It is a smart
service and, aside from the bizarre
choice of not launching the service
on iOS in addition to Android and
Desktop (presumably it will come
in time), it will interest some people
for a time at least.
Yet it is highly derivative of
other services that don’t require
subscription to the arcane world
of Twitter. Snapchat, an app for
sending short-lived images and
videos to friends, has already added
just such a feature. This almost
identical service, found under the
category Discover in the app, offers
Snapchatters the opportunity to
read curated articles from news
outlets along with video and
images. The service is effectively a

Old dog, new tricks?
Can Twitter’s recently re-instated CEO, Jack Dorsey, do better this time?
more accessible multimedia Twitter
feed assembled by news outlets and
websites themselves. This highly
intuitive approach will draw in users
to such paid content far more easily
than Twitter’s Moments approach.
The fundamental issue of Twitter’s
restrictiveness remains: formats
like Snapchat and Facebook have
the ability to create new features
without alienating puritanical
users accustomed to a very narrow
set of features. This not only
maintains user growth but allows
the developers to experiment with
new revenue streams. Twitter,
by contrast, appears stuck in an
inexorable Catch-22. Evolve and
lose its key demographic; stay put
and condemn itself never to turn a
profit.
Of course theres a third way:
if revenues cannot be bolstered,
reduce operating costs. In fact
Mr Dorsey is planning to do just
that. This week, 336 job cuts were
announced. Such a move, ruthless
but seemingly necessary in the face
of continued stagnation, suggests
Mr Dorsey may well have what
it takes to improve Twitter’s (and
investors’) prospects. The 2% share
increase in Twitter following this
announcement suggests the same. It
does hint, however, that like me, he
doesn’t think Moments will be the
game changer it was claimed to be.
