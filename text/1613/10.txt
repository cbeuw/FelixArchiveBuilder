Measure for Measure at the Young Vic
I’m not a fan of Shakespeare’s
comedies. The script is often too
dated to be funny, the story drags
and more than half the cast is alive
at the end. How boring. Luckily,
not everyone is a dull Shakespeare
purist, and for this production of
Measure for Measure, the Young
Vic have spiced it right up. In a
fantastically current multimedia
extravaganza, Joe Hill-Gibbins
directs Shakespeare’s sauciest
comedy to remarkable effect.
Measure for Measure runs the
fine line between comedy and
tragedy. A biting satire of religious
virtue (at least in this production),
Angelo, left in charge by the absent
Duke of Vienna, condemns the
well-meaning adulterer Claudio to
death. With the well-established
whoremongers of Vienna outraged,
Claudio’s oh so virtuous sister
Isabella is drafted in from the
nunnery to ease Angelo’s hand.
With more than its fair share of sex
and sass, and dozens of allusions
to the sword and sheath, Measure
for Measure is a wonderfully sharp
riposte to religious prudity and at
least in Joe Hill-Gibbins’ eyes, a
well-rounded ‘fuck you’ to God.
A progressive, attention seeking
production, Hill Gibbins offers the
viewer a remarkable variety in his
choice of staging falling somewhere
between a sit-com and a sermon.
Romola Garai is outstanding as the
wonderful Isabella and Paul Ready
is a dark and dangerous Angelo.
The production isn’t faultless but
it’s about as good as Shakespeare’s
comedies get.
Measure for Measure is at the Young
Vic until 14th
November.

Guess what! Shakespeare’s
comedies are actually funny!
Ai Weiwei at the Royal Academy
T
he Ai Weiwei exhibition
at the Royal Academy
of Arts is most certainly
worth going to. The
artist’s work is deeply political but
at the same time very aesthetically
pleasing. What really leaves an
impression though is the tenacity of
the author in his mission to expose
the wrongdoings of the Chinese
government through his art. His
determination can be seen through
the thousands of metal beams
collected from the ruins of a school
and methodically straightened
to illustrate the corruption of the
government which caused the death
of over 5000 children in the 2008
Sichuan earthquake. Ai Weiwei
can be seen through this exhibition
as a man who will do anything for
his art. He even shows the room
where he was illegally detained for
81 days by the Chinese government
and the atrocious conditions he
was kept in. The exhibit shows the
complete lack of privacy that the
artist was subjected to during his
imprisonment. In all the scenes
the two armed guards never leave
his side. The viewer watches all this
through tiny windows inside huge
concrete boxes. This makes them
feel almost as if they were spying on
the events occurring inside.
The exhibit does nevertheless have
lighter moments. The exhibit as a
whole is a mixture of the modern
and the ancient; the areas dedicated
to a more recent history of China
are very political and often verging
on the macabre. However, the parts
dedicated to the history of the
artist’s country seem to show the
artist’s positive attitude towards his
own country and his strong link to
it’s history. A whole section of the
exhibit is dedicated to sculptures
constructed out of ancient Chinese
furniture, one of which, a wheel
made out of stools, appears to defy
gravity. The work called “Bed”
resembles a large wooden carpet but
if the viewer crouches down they
will notice that it is actually a rolled
out model of the Chinese border.
At the same time though, the
viewer will see photographs
of Weiwei calmly destroying a
Han dynasty vase. The complete
impassability of his face in those
photographs is striking. Similarly
shocking is the room full of ancient
vases painted in bright colours or
Alicja Brożek

crushed to dust and displayed in
jars. The artist appears to try and
invert the idea of value, defacing
and destroying items that would
theoretically be considered of value
and at the same time constructing
jade and marble sculptures of
objects that would be considered
worthless or even lewd, like sex toys
and butt plugs.
The exhibition is the largest show
of Ai Weiwei’s work ever held in
Britain. You can see the artist’s
The Chinese dissident returns to the RA with some of his most powerful work yet
Ai Weiwei
can be seen
through this
exhibition as a
man who will
do anything
for his art
fighting spirit from the moment you
set foot in the gallery. Every piece
of his work shows so much passion
that it can be a little overwhelming.
Even if you are not particularly
interested in the political aspect of
the exhibition, I would recommend
going just as a reminder of how
much a person can take if they’re
truly determined in their “mission”.
Ai Weiwei is at the Royal Academy of
Arts until 13th
December.

Brian Eno on the ecology of culture
I
t is often hard to remember
how much of what we do is
not a necessity but rather a
choice.How we dress,what we
wear, what we listen to and how we
work, a large part of our expression
comes from the details we live
our lives by. For Brian Eno, these
actions of choice are what define art
– anything you don’t have to do.
The composer, producer, artist,
innovator and all round genius,
Brian Eno has been one of the
foremost cultural figures in the
UK over the last forty years. The
reluctant keyboard player for the
legendary Roxy Music, Eno’s
influence on the British art scene is
phenomenal. Described as Bowie’s
muse, Talking Head’s catalyst and
U2’s fifth man,the artistic polymath
Eno brings his unique vision to this
year’s John Peel Lecture, in memory
of music’s greatest DJ.
For this year’s lecture, Eno speaks
with great care and consideration
on the ecology of culture. A
response to the capitalist view of a
creative ‘industry’, Eno questions
our current approach to the arts and
speaks with poise on the importance
of art in our lives. It is an odd
question – for some art’s value is
so obvious and ingrained that it
seems like a pointless question,
yet there are countless people for
whom art offers nothing. With
the classic definition of art that is
understandable,but Eno’s definition,
which includes activities such as
sport, appreciates that art’s effect in
offering an outlet for thought and
a safe space to encounter complex,
difficult emotions is not unique to
the traditional artistic endeavours.
I admire the openness to Eno’s
approach and dwelling on it, it feels
increasingly clear. In consuming art
you learn a lot about the world but
you learn a lot more about yourself.
Whether you enjoy theatre like I do,
music like almost everyone does, or
admire manhole covers like Corbyn,
there is an individuality and a space
for ourselves which I’m not sure we
could live without.
There is of course a problem. To
consume great art society needs to
create great art. Individual genius is
often given credit for the creation
of great art, but it’s clustering in
history suggests otherwise. Scenius
is the word Eno gives it and it
describes the genius of a community.
An environment in which art isn’t a
luxury but a hugely powerful and
cherished force. The Renaissance,

it still needs each of its individual
parts to function as a whole. As
neoliberalism has taken hold, parts
of the ecosystems functionality have
broken down and the result, the arts
are suffering.

so much better. As Eno reminds us,
it is surprising the number of core
British social institutions without
which he would never have made it
as an artist. John Peel at the BBC
who gave Roxy Music their first
radio spot, the NHS, the dole and
many more. All these institutions
are under attack and the arguments
for their reduction are always
very direct, but it is important to
acknowledge the wider effect of
such actions. In Paul Mason’s post-
capitalist society where automation
will increasingly take over, we
need to carefully consider whether
promoting STEM subjects over the
arts is really the way forward. There
is a place for both, but getting the
balance right is crucial.
I’ve gone off on one, I know. Such
is the power of Brian Eno’s soothing
voice. Speaking for just under an
hour on the ecology of culture, I
only wish he had gone on for a little
longer. His approach is evidently
one sided – so is mine – but there
is substance to it. What Eno says
is largely predictable from a figure
like him, yet he speaks with an
enviable grace. Whether you agree
with his words or not, taking the
time to listen to this year’s John Peel
Lecture is definitely worth it.
The John Peel Lecture is on BBC
iPlayer until 1st
November.
