Straight-talking Politics
The race for the 2016 Republican
presidential nomination has
highlighted the power of “straight-
talking” politics and its ability to
engage the otherwise apolitical
ever more outlandish and offensive
statements. The two current front-
runners, Donald Trump and Ben
Carson, have shown that a sizable
proportion of right-wing Americans
have grown disillusioned with
conventional politics and career
politicians. In this political climate,
it wasn’t massively surprising when
Kanye West announced he would
run for President in 2020, at this
year’s VMAs.
Whilst Trump and Carson’s
celebrity appeal seems to have
played a part in their success, it’s the
“honest” politics that they’ve both
been promoting that Kanye will
hope to emulate the most. Whether
he has the ability to connect with
Americans in the same way that
others have done is questionable,but
he does have a certain confidence
in himself (particularly in his
impressive body of work) that few
of his future contemporaries could
ever aim to reproduce.The tweets he
comes out with aren’t far from the
nonsensical and often contentious
words that are unflaggingly excreted
from the hole in Donald Trump’s
leathered face – so it would be unfair
to dismiss his candidacy completely.
Kanye has endorsed the
Democratic party a number of
times in the past, so one might
assumption that he would run on
some sort of progressive platform,
although (confusingly) in recent
weeks he has praised Ben Carson, a
politician whose views are somehow
Race and Class
I would once have argued that
race would be Kanye’s biggest
talking point – it’s a recurring
theme throughout his lyrics and in
his public appearances.He famously
claimed live on-air, during a benefit
concert for Hurricane Katrina relief
in 2005, that “George Bush doesn’t
care about black people.” Yet now
he claims racism is no longer a
problem in America; in his opinion,
a single black president and his own
personal success (and the success of
his peers) prove that discrimination
based on race isn’t really a thing.
Apparently, the real issue is class,
and people inviting you to dinners
just to laugh at your teeth. It’s hard
not to feel sorry for a man with a
fortune of over $100 million who
isn’t being included and respected in
the way he wants. Through his rise
to the top he has grown incredibly
self-absorbed, which he even
admits himself: “I embody every
characteristic of the egotistic.”
It’s worrying that he’s starting to
lose touch with the reality of Black
America; classism is obviously a
problem but deep-rooted prejudices
against the black community
must be solved first rather than
completely ignored.
Income Inequality
Ye has little to say about income
inequality or the greed of corporate
America, which isn’t surprising for
a man who charges thousands of
dollars for torn grey sweaters. He
did once show up in support of the
Occupy Wall Street movement,
resulting in a rather awkward
interview in which he nodded along
quietly as fellow activist Russell
Cale Tilford
Music Editor
Simmons explained his position.
More recently, he tweeted his
disapproval of exploitative mobile
games: “Fuck any game company
that puts in-app purchases on
kids games!!!” Just last year, the
European Commission introduced
measures to protect children from
in-app purchases – could we see
President West doing something
even more shameless and idiotic
than Trump’s, saying: “This is the
most brilliant guy.” Oh, Kanye.
Kanye’s political positions are
particularly difficult to discern. It
would interesting to ask how he
thinks he could make America great
again, and it’s likely his response
would focus on the social, racial
and class issues that America faces
today.
masses.
In each debate and interview
we’ve watched as candidates
attempt to trump each other with
similar? Maybe not if Kim has
any say in the matter – with her
app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,
bringing in over $200 million in
revenue last year.
Foreign Affairs
His position on foreign affairs
is slightly less confusing. Having
expressed opposition to the Iraq
war, Kanye is certainly to the left
of some of the current Democratic
candidates.
Kanye’s most politically-charged lyrics
“What’s the life
expectancy for black
guys? / The system’s
working effectively, that’s
why.”
‘Murder To Excellence’
“Drug dealer buy
Jordans, crackhead buy
crack / And a white man
get paid off of all of that.”
‘All Falls Down’
“I never understood
planned parenthood /
Cause I never met nobody
that planned to be a
parent in the hood.”
‘The Joy’
“You know the kids
gonna act a fool / when
you stop the programs for
after-school”
‘We Don’t Care’
“Fuck you and your
corporation”
‘New Slaves’

One Nation Under Yeezus – A Guide to the Politics of Kanye West

However, there’s the slight worry
that he might have a fetish for
global nuclear devastation – as is the
only situation in which his weirdly
would have hoped, and last year
he even applied to fashion school:
“I wanted to go to Central Saint
Martins, but Louise Goldin said
that I was too famous.” Maybe he’ll
introduce fashion school legislation
to introduce quotas for self-loving
multi-millionaires.
The Political Class
It’s also important to consider how
Kanye would fit into the political
establishment in Washington.
Major political figures haven’t
totally dismissed his aspirations;
both Hillary Clinton and Obama
mentioned him this week, with
the former recommending that
“he might want to wait beause
I’ll be running for reelection.”
The Democrat front-runner then
went onto suggest that she wasn’t
completely averse to Kanye running
as her Vice President in 2020.
It’s entirely possibly that Hillary
won’t win next year or run for re-
election in 2020, so Ye might want
consider who he would choose as
his running mate. Arguably, the
most obvious contender would be
Taylor Swift. Their relationship has
come a long way since the infamous
2009 VMAs. Last month, Swift
presented West with the Video
Vanguard Award, and Swift took
to Instagram to thank Kanye for
flowers he had sent. A Swift/West
alliance could be unstoppable.
I’m not sure that Kanye really
understands politics, or what it
means to be a politician in America.
The Citizens United case in 2010
essentially legalised bribery, so if
Kanye is really serious he’ll need
to start making even more friends
post-apocalyptic, hunger-games
inspired clothes line would actually
make sense. Is this the beautiful
dark twisted fantasy he’s been raving
about?
Education
Education features prominently
in Kanye’s discography; his debut
album The College Dropout reflects
on his decision to drop out of college
in pursuit of his musical dreams
(much to the disappointment of his
mother).He’s publicly advocated for
the modernisation of Arts education
in the past, suggesting: “People are
so behind.There’s poetry classes,but
why aren’t there rap curriculums?”
So, it’s likely that his presidency
would see some sort of overhaul of
public education.
The fashion establishment also
hasn’t been as inclusive as Kanye
He’ll need
to start
making
even more
friends with
very deep
pockets
with very deep pockets (he may owe
Jay-Z a few favours if he ever finds
himself sitting in the Oval Office).
So far this year over $400 million
has been been raised in political
donations,and in all recent elections
the candidate with most financial
backing has always won. After his
initial announcement that he was
planning to run in 2020, Kanye was
quoted as saying “I hate politics. I’m
not a politician at all. I care about
the truth and I just care about
human beings. I just want everyone
to win.” So far, so good.
“When I run for president, I’d
prefer not to run against someone,
I would be like ‘I want to work
with you’.” You’ve got to admire his
optimism, but in reality this naivety
could be his downfall. Everyone
knows the Republican party won’t
play nicely. If he does actually run in
2020 (which I’m sure will somehow
be aligned with the release of a new
album), he’s got a lot of learning to
do.
It’s hard to imagine a world
in which Kanye could win the
Democratic primary, let alone
become become President of the
most powerful nation on Earth.
That being said, if Donald Trump
wins in 2016 anything could be
possible, and America’s appetite for
change could be greater than ever.
Kanye’s next album,Late Nomination,
will be released in 2020, probably.
A Swift/
West
alliance
could
potentially
be
unstoppable
