Pics or it didn’t happen
Should we mourn the loss of nudity from the pages of Playboy magazine?

our girlfriend might
finally start believing
you when you tell her
you “only read it for the
articles”: earlier this week Cory
Jones, a top editor at Playboy,
announced that the mag will soon
stop publishing pictures of nude
women. From next March we will
see a new design, which will still
feature women in provocative poses,
but unfortunately no longer fully
nude.
Is it unfortunate though? The
company’s chief executive, Scott
Flanders,said the decision was made
because we’re all “now one click
away from every sex act imaginable
for free… it’s just passé at this
juncture”, and I tend to agree with

him. If there’s one thing we’re not
running short of,it’s porn: a study by
‘adult’ website paintbottle.com found
that porn sites get more visitors each
month than Netflix, Amazon and
Twitter combined.
As iconic as Playboy is for
busty bunnies and barely-dressed
babes, this decision fits the trend
of Playboy’s pivot from their old
reputation.Looking at their website,
playboy.com, you are greeted with
articles like ‘Check Out This Dude
Handle This King Cobra Snake
Like a Total Badass’ and ‘Someone
Turned a 90s Sign Language Video
into 3 Minutes of Penis Jokes’,under
the almost-too-self-aware heading
of ‘Clickbait’. Sounds a bit different
to the magazine you used to know,
doesn’t it?
Playboy has made a smart decision
to keep with the times, but will its
readership suffer due to the lack of
graphic content? As any 14-year-
old boy with an Internet connection
could tell you: there’s plenty more
where that came from.

Human rights, arms deals and the UK government
Why on earth did the UK support the UN Human Rights Council application of a country
that is executing an 18 year old?

Jon Snow is known for several
things – his perennial presence on
channel four’s news programming;
his eclectic and eccentric selection
of ties worn during important
interviews; and his no-nonsense
approach to interviewing.
Whether it be annihilating an
Israel Defense Forces spokesperson
for defending the killing of four
Palestinian children on a beach in
2014, or seriously grilling Russell
Brand on his view of UK drug
policy; Jon Snow is one of the
few journalists not afraid to tackle
important questions even if they
make people uncomfortable. There
was also that one time he got high
for a documentary and had to
cuddle a doctor.
The most recent display of this
ferocious tenacity was his interview
with David Cameron on Saudi
Arabia, migration and ISIS, in
which Jon Snow brought up the
case of Ali Mohamed al-Nimr, a
17 year old Saudi Arabian teenager
who faces death by crucifixion due
to his involvement in protests when
he was 14.
Snow confronted Cameron about
a deal done in November last year,
in which the UK agreed to back
Saudi Arabia joining the UN
Human Rights Council as long as
they reciprocrated and backed the
UK.
This highlighted the hypocrisy
of the Conservative government;
supposedlyagainstthedeathpenalty,
and by extension the execution of al-
Namir (although Cameron himself
has yet to personally denounce the
sentence), whilst still consorting
with a country bent on carrying out
such a punishment.
In response to Snow’s question,
Cameron said this UN Human
Rights deal was struck because a
friendly relationship with Saudi
Arabia serves the interests of the
UK. We “receive information
that keeps us safe” as a matter of
“national security”, and that more
than anything “the national security
of Britain comes first”.
I’m going to take a breath here
and just emphasize this fact: our
government conducted a secret deal
that was only made public when
these documents were leaked and
then picked up by The Guardian.
Saudi Arabia’s continued use of
the death penalty is far from the
only problem: It still uses extensive
corporal punishment, like in the
case of 64 year old Karl Andree who
this week has been sentenced to 360
lashes for transporting homemade
wine in his car. The country’s
judicial system still refuses to pass
any laws to protect the rights of
its 9 million foreign workers. The
kafala system still in place grants
employers the right to prevent

foreign workers leaving their jobs,
or even the country, without direct
written consent from their bosses.
Saudi Arabia still places women
under a discriminatory male
guardianship system which prevents
them from obtaining a passport,
marrying, traveling, or accessing
higher education without the
approval of a male guardian. In
short, not generally a very liberal
place. Despite this, our government
thought that they were a good
partner to back for the UN human
rights council.
Cameron’s point, that we receive
valuable information from Saudi
Arabia that is essential to national
security,is one that neither I nor any
member of the public can know is
valid until the information is leaked
or released in decades to come
under a Freedom of Information
request.This justification seems like
a very thinly veiled excuse for what
appears so obvious to this writer:
MONEY.
First of all, it’s important to
recognize that Saudi Arabia is the
largest buyer of British-made arms.
The UK has sold Saudi Arabia 72
Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft for an
estimated £4.4bn, we’ve upgraded
Saudi Tornado aircraft for £2.5bn,
and upgraded 70 American made
F15 combat jets for the Saudi
Arabian Air force in recent years.
A large number of bombs originally
intended for use by the RAF have
been sold to the Saudi Arabian air
force to facilitate their ongoing
bombing campaign against Houthi
rebels based in Yemen.
Our relationship with Saudi
Arabia is one that should be paid
attention to - I personally cannot
imagine a situation where as a
country we can support these
violations of human rights in return
for whatever information we may
receive, or goods we can sell. At the
moment our government turns a
blind eye, but I think that it is only
a matter of time before the British
people refuse to be part of this
poisonous relationship.
Despite
this, our
government
thought that
they were
a good
partner to
back
