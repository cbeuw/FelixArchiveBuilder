T
.S. Eliot’s 1949 play may
have started off as an
ordinary drawing room
comedy, but it soon
becomes clear that the cocktail party
banter hides more than just each
character’s personal demons. The
scene opens with a cocktail party
hosted by Edward Chamberlayne,
who tries throughout the party to
convince his guests that his wife had
not simply left him but had gone to
visit her sick aunt. It was not until
all but one of the guests had left that
Edward reveals to a stranger that
his wife Lavinia had left him that
morning without an explanation.
More revelations follow, including
the tension between the couple and
an affair between Edward and one
of the party’s other guests, Celia.
The stranger turns out to be a kind
of psychiatrist which the couple
and Celia visit in an attempt to sort
out their choices. Each is presented
with a choice of either carrying on
with the status quo or going on an
arduous journey to seek something
that truly matters in their lives.

their marriage in a state of mutual
tolerance while Celia decides to
embark on her journey – it is not
until two years later that we learn
that she has died working in Africa,
crucified by the tribes.
Obvious themes of Celia being
a martyr for seeking out the
meaningful life aside, Eliot’s play
becomes a landscape for the choices
every one of us face at some point in
our lives. There is always a dilemma
between convenience and stepping
out of one’s comfort zone, and the
choice of the latter is a difficult and
potentially hazardous one.
With a rather Absurdist colour in
a time before such themes started to
inspire theatre, The Cocktail Party
celebrates the unexamined life in
all its florid, Dior-clad detail. Said
to be inspired by the Greek tragedy
Alcestis, the play suggests higher
powers at work,as we realise that the
stranger-psychiatrist and two other
characters, Julia and Alex, appear to
have known about the couple and
Celia’s struggles all along. In fact,
they are reminiscent of the three
fates guiding their lives.
Print Room’s production is
crisp and minimalist, with the
set consisting only of a few tables
and an old-fashioned telephone
spotlighted on the wall. The
company uses the converted old
Coronet cinema in Notting Hill
and this is its first performance in
the main auditorium. The theatre is
clearly old yet oddly charming, with
paint peeling off the walls and the
soft shafts of light from its flanks
bathing the characters in an ethereal
glow, as if emphasizing the almost
mythological quality of its themes.
Richard Dempsey and Helen
Bradbury put up an impeccable
performance as the Chamberlaynes,
their exchanges just calculated to
bring out the threatening tension
between them.
Despite being a relatively fresh
face on the scene, Print Room at
the Coronet hasw done several
excellent performances to date and
its unique home of the restored
Coronet cinema promises to give an
interesting twist to its productions.
This run of The Cocktail Party has
again shown that the company can
put up successful full-length, multi-
character performances – definitely
an up-and-coming company worth
checking out.

On Speaking Quietly with My Brother
You who threw the rock at the back of my head
as hard as you could at four because you thought
this was how to make a stone skip on the ocean,
I have watched you in the dark of a yard
where we can only see each other by a lamp left on
some rooms away. We can see only
one another’s chin. Soon, you will stay up
through the night after I fall
into a laughing sleep.Two moths dust
the same screen for remembered light.
We have all been removed from the lyrics, brother,
our names will be stricken from the papers.
When I think of you and me and recall some
adolescent sunrise, standing on rooftops,
blue still the island but the bowl of it about
to fill with light, it is perhaps strange and horrible
to know one day one of us will die
and the other will be alive, volume turned up,
his mouth now weighing twice as much.
We cannot be excused from this
device of road and harrow, from this weight
we heft and heave. So, you will be the sister.
And I will be the sister. And you—
you are about to give me my words.

Cuts could kill off free museum entry
A
couple of weeks ago,
Alan Borg, the director
of the V&A told trustees
that the current system
of voluntary donations is failing to
raise enough money to sustain the
museum. He went on record to
say that “most people could afford
to pay £10 if they wanted to”. His
statements make it increasingly
likely that V&A will start charging
for entry. Currently, visitors are
encouraged to donate £4.50 each
time they visit the V&A, however
the average donation per person is
£1.
The V&A is not alone. Quietly,
some regional council backed
institutions which previously
welcomed visitors for free are
reintroducing entry charges.
Amongst them are York Art Gallery
and Brighton Museum and Art
Gallery. The former has introduced
a £7.50 fee to grant access to its
collection which includes several
paintings by L.S Lowrie.
Regional arts collections, funded
by councils rather than by the central
government have been feeling the
pinch for a while. In 2011, Bolton
Council had to sell paintings from
their collection to cover a £60m
shortfall in their budget. The
paintings sold included works by
Millais and Picasso. These works

have now entered private collections
and are unlikely to be seen in this
country again. At the time, Bolton
council’s actions caused outrage in
the arts world. Bolton councillor
Stephen Pickup, argued at the time
that with public services threatened
by cuts, and closures of care homes
and youth centres imminent,the sale
of art that would fetch thousands
per piece was a credible option.
Chancellor George Osborne’s has
introduced new plans to decrease
departmental spending by 40%.The
Department for Culture, Media
and Sport is likely to be one of
the Whitehall departments to be
most hit. This will mean less money
from the government going to the
country’s 700 national museums
and galleries. These institutions
will increasingly be left in the fiscal
wilderness to fend for themselves,
relying on money spent in gift
shops, cafes and donations. In
anticipation of budget shortfalls,
national galleries are unlikely to
start flogging away their collections
to keep the doors open; for one
thing, it would somewhat defeat
the purpose of opening the doors
in the first place. In comparison,
reintroduction of entry charges may
seem the more sensible option.
Much like the NHS, which is
free at the point of care, having
museums and galleries free at the
point of entry is something that is
easy to take for granted. As with
any generous policy, this leaves
room for abuse of the system. It
means sometimes visitors go into
galleries to get away for the rain,
and it means that some visitors
don’t go the shop or don’t donate.
However, many more visitors do
donate. Most importantly, the
policy sends the message that as
society we are saying, to quote
Jessie J, “it’s not about the money
(money, money)”. Free admission
is investment in the positive effect
arts can have on young people,
including broadnening horizons
and improving mental health.
Charging for admission
dramatically reduces the likelihood
that students, young people and
those from more disadvantaged
backgrounds will become involved
in the arts and may foster a lifelong
disllusionment and isolation from
the benefits that museums and
galleries can provide.
Rarely do matters of principle and
ideals hold much water in the world
of politics,for all this talk on ‘the big
society’, but free admission makes
sense on an economic level as well.
Currently eight of the top
ten visitor attractions in Britain
are national museums with free
admission. Three of the five most
popular museums in the world are
in this country.A visit to the Louvre
to see the Mona Lisa will set you
back €15; a trip to the Museum of
Modern Art in New York will cost
you $25. This country remains just
about the only place in the world
where you can walk into a gallery
or museum and look at a Picasso
or Monet for five minutes or five
hours and not spend a penny. The
free admission policy has made
a dramatic difference to visitor
numbers, in some cases by more
than 150%. Conversely, when Poole
Museum started charging entry fees
their visitor numbers fell by 75%.
When they reversed their decision,
the money raised from the café and
the gift shop overtook the funds
raised from ticket sales. The V&A
faced a similar situation when they
flip-flopped on the issue a few years
ago,which should act as a cautionary
tale for Alan Borg this time around.
Free admission for national
museums was established under the
Blair government in 2001 and the
policy has become one of the few,
along with a free NHS, that has
entered into political orthodoxy.
Successive Conservative Culture
Secretaries have supported the
idea of free admission, and on his
appointment the current minister
John Whittingdale made point
of saying it was not an issue the
government is looking to debate.
As the country faces five more years
of austerity and the government
continues to reduce the state, the
idea of giving free reign to galleries
and museums to charge what they
like will surely become tempting.To
give into that temptation would be
a mistake.
