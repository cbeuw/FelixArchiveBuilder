I
t was the longest queue of the
whole festival.The anticipation
for Yorgos Lanthimos’ first
English-language feature, The
Lobster,had reached such fever pitch
on its long march from Cannes,
that by the time the London
Film Festival screen opened to
the press, a row of journalists and
industry delegates stretched along
the balcony of the newly-opened
Picturehouse Central, down the
staircase (illuminated tastefully
from that icon of hip postmodernity
– the ubiquitous hanging bulb),
around the café, out into the street,
back into the building, back up the
stairs, and into the bar. While those
around grumbled about the length,
worrying about whether they would
get in, there was one question on
everyone’s minds: will it be worth it?
It certainly was. The Lobster is a
truly brilliant film, one that – with
its stellar cast, exceptional script,
and bold, idiosyncratic themes – is
sure to rank as one of the year’s best.
Taking place in a dystopian world –
one not futuristic, but wholly of the
moment – The Lobster postulates a
scenario in which human loneliness
has been outlawed; those who
find themselves single, whether by
design or accident, are sent to The
Hotel, where they have 45 days to
find a mate before they are turned
into an animal of their choice.Their
time can be extended by taking
part in The Hunt, a bizarre ritual
in which the besuited guests take
up tranquilizer guns and attempt to
capture The Loners – a gang of of
defiantly-single renegades who live
in the forest.
Our point of entry into this world
is Colin Farrell’s character who,
following a divorce, finds himself in
the hotel – half summer resort, half
prison – faced with the prospect of
being turned into a lobster, a choice
commended by Olivia Colman’s
hotel manager (‘most people choose
a dog. That’s why the world is full
of dogs’). Colman’s character plays
the dual role of matchmaker and
correctional officer, like Cilla Black
crossed with Nurse Ratched, while
The Hotel functions like some kind
of Butlins from hell: newly arrived
visitors have one hand tied behind
their back to remind them that
things are better in pairs, and bleak
skits are organised to emphasise the
advantages of partner-hood.
Farrell’s character’s time at The
Hotel is marked by a series of bad
decisions, culminating in choosing
to pair with a woman with no
emotions (Angeliki Papoulia),
renowned for her skill in hunting
Loners.Of course,it is a partnership
that cannot last, and the ill-suited
match leads to some of the most
profoundly brutal scenes of the film,
before Farrell’s character flees to the
woods and joins The Loners. But
even being alone has rules.The gang,
led by the mysterious Lea Seydoux,
live by a code of their own, one that
emphasizes the need for solidarity
above all else: flirtation is punished
by slicing open people’s lips,
everyone dances solo to electronica,
and the highest punishment is
known as ‘The Red Intercourse’.
Unfortunately, while in their
company Farrell manages to fall in
love with a woman (Rachel Weisz),
whose major attraction comes
from the fact that she, like him, is
shortsighted. This is a world where
arbitrary common characteristics
are a prerequisite for a well-made
match, a fact underscored by the
closing credits: Ben Whishaw – The
Limping Man; John C. Reilly –
Lisping Man. While such a concept
may seem far-fetched,if we consider
that OkCupid, branded as ‘the best
dating site on Earth’, operates
on the premise that a series of

The
Lobster is
a romance
with a heart
of stone
The Lobster – A New Breed of Romance
Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest gem is a postmodern love story with deadly claws
questionnaires fed into algorithms
can lead to a perfect match, the idea
seems much closer to home – even
true love can be systemised. This
feature comes back around in the
final scene of the film, which leaves
the audience reeling from horrifying
ambiguity.
Lanthimos has proved himself
adept at creating completely new
worlds. Like his breakout film,
Dogtooth, The Lobster’s environment
is at once immediately familiar, and
completely alienating. As dating
apps like Tinder become more
prevalent in society, and the phrase
‘we met on the internet’ becomes
more and more acceptable, we
are beginning to enter a phase of
history in which there is no excuse
for singledom, and an increasing
pressure for those who choose
to remain alone to justify their
decisions.
The Lobster marks Lanthimos’
third feature with writer and regular
collaborator, Efthimis Filippou,
who injects his trademark deadpan
humour into the dialogue, which
often spills over into sheer brutality.
With this being the director’s first
English-language production, there
is a fear that the script would lose
some of the energy of his previous

Whishaw. 118 minutes.
films. This proves to be unfounded
– while there is a certain woodiness
within the film, both from the
actors and the script, this is part-
and-parcel of the film’s experience,
akin to a Pinter play in terms of
unsettling off-putting-ness. At
many points in the film, the silence
of the auditorium was punctuated
by incredulous laughter, as if to say
‘how can I be laughing at something
so grotesque?’ But Lanthimos and
Filippou tread the line between
humour and repulsion with great
ease.
The Lobster serves to cement
Lanthimos’ well-earned reputation
as one of the most exciting
directorial talents working today.
While the film dips in energy
towards the end – something that
could have been perhaps solved
by a more decisive hand taking
to the cutting floor – the scenario
the film sets up is nothing short of
astounding. Straddling genres with
skill, The Lobster is a sci-fi without
technology, a horror film without
scares, a romance with a heart of
stone. It is a walking contradiction.
It is the most exciting thing I have
seen all year.
The Lobster is released on Friday,

W
hile Studio Ghibli
has gifted us
with a number
of adaptations of
children’s tales, they have clearly
never come across The Boy Who
Cried Wolf. For the last few years,
every announcement of a new film
comes with it the warning cry
that this may be the last one for
a while. While the creative heart
of the company, Hayao Miyazaki
announced his retirement in 2013,
he is still working to create short
films, and – after all – he said the
same thing in 1997. So the news
that their latest release, When
Marnie Was There, is to be their last
film for the foreseeable future, does
not fill me with dread; or maybe it’s
just wishful thinking, optimistically
keeping the truth at bay, for – most
can agree – that Studio Ghibli has
made some of the most technically
impressive, emotionally complex
animated films of the last half-
century.
Based on the novel by Joan
G. Robinson, the film concerns
Anna, a young asthmatic girl who
is sent from Sapporo to the rural
seaside town of Kushiro for her
health; as well as her breathing, it
seems that Anna is suffering from
some kind of psychological strain,
linked to the strained relationship
she has with her well-meaning
foster parents. With a talent for
drawing, Anna simply wants to be
left alone, eschewing the company
of local children in order to sit for
innumerable hours looking across
the salt marsh at the abandoned
mansion, overgrown with gothic
sentiment.
Rowing across to the mansion
one night at high tide, she meets
Marnie, a young girl of the Old-
Time-Europe variety (golden curls,
bright blue eyes, pretty ruffled
dresses), whom she immediately
befriends. What follows is an
exploration of the role of memories
and the imagination: is Marnie a
Censored Voices
Dir: Mor Loushy. Script: Mor
Loushy, Daniel Sivan. Starring:
Amos Oz, Avraham Shapira. 84
minutes.
M
or Loushy is a lucky
woman. In being
granted access to
the source material
of her feature film Censored Voice,
she scored a coup for truth-telling,
uncovering something akin to
a documentarian’s wet dream.
Censored Voices is a literal title,taking
its name from the tapes of interviews
conducted by kibbutzniks Avraham
Shapira and Amos Oz immediately
following the end of Israel’s Six-
Day War in 1967 – in which Israel
scored a decisive victory against
its surrounding countries, despite
being greatly outnumbered, and in
the process expanded its territory
into and past Gaza and the West
Bank. While the phrases ‘territorial
gains’ and ‘Israel’ may not sit well
together for many of us, the Six-
Day War helped to form the Israeli
national identity, going down in
Israel’s consciousness as possibly
the most momentous occasion of its
short existence.
The soldiers involved in the
conflict,which left more than 20,000
Egyptians, Syrians, and Jordanians
dead,and thousands more displaced,
returned home as heroes, and were
lionized in the Israeli media. Since
then the story has gone undisturbed,
with the government censoring any
potentially damaging evidence,
such as Shapira and Oz’s tapes.
Made with other kibbutzniks and
returning soldiers, the tapes paint a
very different picture of the army’s
psychological condition: battered,
exhausted, forced to witness and
partake in innumerable horrors,
the soldiers returned home broken.
Like returning crusaders they
were welcomed back as liberators
of Israel, who fought for access to
holy monuments, but really they
were scared young men, a fact that
Loushy’s film delicately brings to
light.
Consisting of the tapes playing
over old footage from the War,
interspersed with clips of the
soldiers alive today – old men,
with paunches and squinting eyes,
completely unrecognisable from
the strapping youth of the tapes –
the documentary takes a scalpel to
Israeli history, revealing the truth
that lingers just below the surface.
While the editing is certainly
effective, there is the lingering
feeling that we still aren’t hearing
the whole story; creating a film
requires cutting certain aspects
of the speech, arranging it to suit
the trim 87 minute runtime, and I
am sure that there are hours upon
hours of extra tapes that Loushy
was unable to use. Understandable,
since to be crushed under the sheer
weight of an untold history is not a
pleasant experience, but one hopes
that transcripts of the tapes will be
released, allowing us to explore the
entire story at our own pace.
There is also an imbalance, for me
at least, in terms of what footage
Loushy has used: while old news
footage is certainly invaluable in
allowing us to understand how the
soldiers were lionised by the public,
CensoredVoices is at its most powerful
when we see the men listening to
the tapes, their facial expressions
– nuanced in the way that only
true reactions can be – revealing
the emotions going on inside. The
sound of tired men being listened to
nearly half a century later by those
same men, still tired, still fighting,
shows perfectly the running thread
of truth that stitches us neatly to our
pasts.
While
Loushy’s
editing is
effective,
there is the
sense that
we don’t
hear the
whole story.
real person? Or just a figment of a
lonely child’s imagination? These
themes, along with the strong
indication that Anna has some
kind of anxiety/depressive disorder,
makes this heavy-hitting stuff – the
idea of exploring the mansion of
her imagination makes me think of
a child-friendly remake of Jacques
Rivette’s Celine and Julie Go Boating
– but it is a pity that director
Hiromasa Yonebayashi doesn’t
follow up this initial promise.
Instead all the loose ends of When
Marnie Was There are tied up very
neatly, with a near-implausible
family revelation discovered at the
end of the film. While naturally
constrained by the source material,
it would have been fantastic if they
could have held onto the eerie,
unsettling atmosphere that made
the first half so captivating.
The film’s

are heavy-
hitting,

neat ending
