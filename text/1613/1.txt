Prince Andrew hosts
entrepreneurial contest
W
ednesday saw the
Duke of York come
to Imperial, to host
his Pitch@Palace
entrepreneurial competition.
The royal,who is the Queen’s third
child, stood down as the UK trade
envoy after being criticised over
his friendships with controversial
figures, such as Azerbaijan’s
president and Jeffrey Epstein. In
an effort to support inventors and
investors, the competition allows
groups to pitch their ideas to
professionals who will help them
hone their presentation skills, and
potentially invest.
42 teams pitched to a panel of
judges in a marquee on Queen’s
Lawn, which will house graduates
at Monday’s Commemoration Day.
Two teams from Imperial got
through the Bootcamp stage this
week, and will go on to pitch their
ideas at St James’ Palace. They were
KNYTTAN,a company digitalising
knitwear production, and LifeBox,
a lowcost incubator for use in
developing countries.
The Duke prepared competitors
for the final round in his closing
remarks of the day. Taking the
stage just after the winners were
announced,he quipped,“I bet you’re
all glad that’s over”, before giving
the winners some advice.
“Palaces are designed to
intimidate”, he said, and that since
it is “a formal establishment” that
they should dress accordingly. Just
like your school careers advisor
then, really.
The final, where ideas are pitched
again in front of a room of CEOs,
mentors and potential investors,
gives attendees various important
opportunities, Prince Andrew
warned.
“Networking is very, very

The Student Newspaper of Imperial College London
US Secretary of
Defence visits
Imperial campus
U
nited States Secretary
of Defence Dr Ashton
Carter paid a visit
to Imperial College
London this week to discuss
research ties between the UK
and US, including how Imperial
researchers are taking on a variety of
challenges faced by both countries
in the field of defence.
Also in attendance was his UK
counterpart, the Secretary of State
for Defence, Michael Fallon. The
pair were welcomed to the College
campus by Professor Alice Gast, the
President of Imperial College, last
Friday.
The sojourn kicked off with a tour
of the Royal British Legion Centre
for Blast Injury Studies, where Dr
Carter and Mr Fallon learnt about
Imperial’s research into the loss of
limbs in conflict zones.Such injuries
can often be fatal and are rarely seen
in the civilian world.
Professor Anthony Bull and
Surgeon Rear Admiral Alasdair
Walker explained how they work
to improve protection, clinical
treatment and rehabilitation for
veterans of the armed forces. Dr
Carter hailed the centre’s research
as “amazing and important work”.
Later in the day Dr Carter and
Mr Fallon visited the Bio-inspired
Systems Laboratory to see Professor
Holger Krapp present his research
into the flying behaviour of insects,
which is aiding in the development
of a new generation of autonomous
flying robots.
At a press conference marking the
beginning of Dr Carter’s one-day
visit to the UK, Mr Fallon praised
the work of Sir Henry Tizard, a
former Imperial College Rector:
“75 years ago, the scientific mission
led in the darkest days of the war
by Henry Tizard led onto the
pioneering technology that helped
win that world war”.
He described how this research
united the US and UK governments
in “a scientific partnership that

continues to flourish today. Our
nations currently cooperate on a
range of innovative research projects
from insect-inspired micro-UAV’s
to quantum clocks.
“Some of that effort is
concentrated in Imperial College
London, Tizard’s alma mater”. The
day’s events were kicked off with
the announcement of a new £70
million funding boost to the UK
government’s Defence program,
hoping to drive innovation and the
development of new technology.
important”, he told the
entrepreneurs.
It has been known for members of
the audience to offer teams financial
backing, sometimes minutes after
they present at the final.
Although only 12 teams usually
qualify at this stage, Prince Andrew
said he gave the judges permission
let through an extra three teams,
since they were unable to cut the
number down. The audience at the
palace would have to “jolly well sit
on their arses and listen”, said the
Duke.
Past Pitch@Palace success stories
include Imperial’s very own Yoyo,
who got to the final of the very first
competition.
On Imperial, the sixth in line to
the throne said,“you have truly spoilt
us in these palatial surroundings”.
