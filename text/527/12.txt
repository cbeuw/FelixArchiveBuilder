Hello people and Freshers
This is the first in the seasons tedious
Pressypieces. I will endeavour to make
them interesting but it is very unlikely
that I will.
Despite having to channel vast
proportions of my energy upon court
cases a n d solicitors letters, I have been
quite busy.
O n e of the big things to blow up just
before the hols was a Tory Government.
B e that as it may, this one has decided to
increase the fees of Overseas Studes,
already unfairly discriminatory, by a
further 23% above the cost of living
increases. Despite College's continued
support of on-course students by
Hardship Fund the situation is very
unsatisfactory. The rationing by price is
just one of the Government's stated
cutbacks in Higher Education and I feel
that it is something we must all concern
ourselves with.
Malcolm and I both attended a
conference in Bradford and are totally
committed to take part in some
nationally c o o r d i n a t e d c a m p a i g n .
STAFF
Pam Johnston
Union Receptionist since 1966, Pam
has had to retire due to ill health. I hope
that all students will join me in wishing
her all the best for her future life when
she returns to Canada.
MAZ FELLOWS
Due to the previously announced
departure of Gill McConway, Maz has
started as the FELIX phototypesetter
operator. I hope that her stay with the
Union will be long and enjoyable.
INJUNCTIVITIS
Regarding the FELIX Editorship, this
matter is still sub judice, this means that
only facts can be presented and that is
done elsewhere. I just hope that things
settle down and everyone lives happily
ever after.
WUS SCHOLARSHIP
Once again I must urge you to donate
to the W U S Scholarship Fund, a really
worthwile cause.
OUTRO
If you read my report to the U G M there
is plenty more heavy stuff to read and
there's hardly been a mention of kinky
H o n . S e x l i k e t h e o l d d a y s .
I hope your stay here is long, fun and
successful.
Anyway, there are three places where I
can usually be confronted:
Union Office: internal phone no. 3519
Union Bar
41 Evelyn Gardens: I live in 133 Bernard
Sunley House (just goes to prove some
p e o p l e L I K E S t u d e n t H o u s e s ) .
Please don't hesitate to contact me, for
any reason.

(or Alky Malky writes again)
THE FRESHERS' BIT
Welcome to IC! This the first of a
series of intensely boring articles, which
a lot of people seem to read anyway in
preference to paying attention to the
first lecture on Friday mornings. I'm
responsible for various odds and sods
concerned with running kthe Union, if
you're interested in how we run things or
have any questions about the Union, do
come and have a word with me (I'm in
the Union Bar most nights). I don't bite!
One of the Union's main functions is
to help cater for your social and sporting
activities. If you've ever wanted to take
up a new hobby but never had adequate
facilities available, there's a good
chance you'll find what you want at the
Fresher's Fair tomorrow, where well
over 100 clubs and societies will be
exhibiting in the Union Building and
Sherfield Lower Refectory. There's
something for everybody, so do come
and have a look round. Societies won't
be collecting money from freshers, so if
you're interested in any societies, give
them your name and they'll get in touch
with you. Don't be put off joining a
society just because you don't think you
know enough about it to be a member,
the whole point of these societies is to
givo you the opportunity and training to
do something different.
CRASH PAD
In case you didn't know, we are
providing camp beds in the Union
Building for 50p a night for people who
still haven't found anywhere to live-just
turn up between 11:00 and 12:00. I
expect this to go on for about 3 weeks,
after which we'll have to turf people out.
FRESHER' FAIR
Due to the work being done on Beit
Quad, the outdoor stalls have had to be
moved to the Queen's Lawn, and I have
also decided to use the Sherfield Lower
Refectory so that more stalls can be
accommodated. Details of arrange-
ments have been sent to all stallholders,
so check your letter racks, and if you
haven't received a note, then come and
see me. With any luck, there should be a
set of maps for the fair and an
alphabetical list of societies in this
FELIX somewhere.
The tour STARTS AT 2:30, PLEASE
DO NOT COME BEFORE THIS TIME as
societies will be busy setting up their
stalls, which is made much more difficult
if rooms are already crowded with
people.
BAR AND REFECTORY LOSSES
Last year, £4,000 worth of glasses and
£6,000 of crockery and cutlery went
missing from C o l l e g e bars a n d
refectories. These losses have to be paid
for by higher bar and refectory prices, so
don't take them away. If these sort of
losses continue, the Union may have to
start taking disciplinary action against
people doing so-remember, you're just
making other people pay by the
resulting higher prices.
ELECTIONS
There are some vacancies on two of
the committees which I chair; we need
two ordinary members for the Finance
Committee and three for the London
Student Travel Committee (which may
be on the way to being changed to the
Services Committee by the first Union
meeting on Thursday). Nomination
papers for these posts are up on the
Council noticeboard in the Union Lower
Lounge now.
