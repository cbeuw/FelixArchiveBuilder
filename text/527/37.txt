Ifyou want to save some ofyour
money...
...open a deposit account. Put money in as you like.
Take it out when you want it, subject to seven days'
notice. We pay interest on your money-you'll find
current rates displayed in all our branches.
Standing orders for regular
payments
With a current account, you can instruct us to pay
your regular bills-rent, subscriptions and insurance
premiums-by standing order. It relieves you of the need
to remember when payments are due and then of making
out separate cheques for them. The bank remembers for
you and pays them automatically from your account on
the correct day for as long as you tell us to do so.
So you can forget those embarrassing reminders.
In the course of your studies or once you start work,
you may have the opportunity to go abroad, on business
orforpleasure. Lloyds can help by supplying the currency
and travellers' cheques you need. And if you have a
Cheque Card you can use it abroad
to cash cheques in banks displaying
the Eurocheque symbol.
Advice and services
You'll find your bank manager's advice really useful
before undertaking any new project concerning money-
insurance, house buying, anything involving a financial
committment. It's part of his job to offer advice when
consulted and to help you organise your money to the
best advantage.
From the day you open an account at Lloyds, you'll
find your financial affairs running more smoothly. And
you'll be glad you chose Lloyds because, in the future,
we will be able to offer you a wide range of banking
services to help you throughout life, from filling in tax
returns and arranging all types of insurance, to executorship
of your Will.
