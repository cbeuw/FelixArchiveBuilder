Hello, and yet again welcome to
I.C.. and in particular that crazy
student activity known as Rag. As
you should have gathered by now
from the v a r i o u s h a n d b o o k
articles, Rag's main objectives are to
provide enjoyment for YOU, whilst
raising money for our chosen
charities. Most of the money is
collected on the weekly Rag stunts,
wtiich are organised by each C C U -
so do watch out for their posters,
listen at their U G M s and go out there
and collect, you'll be surprised how
much fun It is.
We also intend to hold Rag Mag
selling trips every Wednesday
afternoon, providing an excellent
o p p o r t u n i t y to v i s i t o t h e r
Universities and meet old friends or
merely sample their bars. However,
at the time of writing we are having
difficulties persuading someone to
print our Mag-so it may not be
available immediately.
But the main job of the IC Rag
Committee is to organise that orgy
of lunacy known as Rag Week,
which stretches from 14th to 23rd
November, and includes such
traditional events as Morphy Day,
the R C S Revue, Rag and Drag
Disco, Rag Procession, raft race,
film nighf and Guilds carnival.
However there are still many gaps
that need filling, especially for
lunch-time events, and to produce
an original and enjoyable Rag week,
we n e e d Y O U R i d e a s a n d
e n t h u s i a s m in i n v e n t i n g and
organising new events. So please
come along to our Rag Committee
m e e t i n g s - e v e r y o n e w i l l be
welcomed with open arms and free
beer to the first meeting-next
Monday (6th October) at 7:00p.m. in
the Senior Common Room (1st
floor, Union Building). After that
they will be held on Wednesday
evenings in the ICWA Lounge.
Watch for further details, both of
meetings and of Rag week, in FELIX
and on posters (wherever you see
'Superag' signs).
Now the confusing bit: (if you
aren't confused already!) you'll have
read in the handbook (I hope) that
we were collecting for kidney
machines, but we've since been
informed that they aren't needed as
all patients get one from the
National Health Service. So we
made Kidney Research one of our
minor charities, and looked around
for something else, which was, like a
kidney machine, of permanent and
direct benefit to someone in need.
We decided to buy 'phonic'
hearing aids for deaf children, as
R C S U had bought one for the
brother of one of our students last
year, and this had demonstrated
their great value in the education of
the deaf, as this child can now speak
properly and attend a normal
secondary school. The aid works on
a radio link which enables the child
to hear his teacher or parent up to
half a mile away, and also eliminates
the background noise which makes
working in' a classroom with a
conventional aid difficult. We are
buying these through the National
Deaf Children's Society, who said,
"It is really a tremendous project
that you are undertaking"- they have
no money available to buy such aids
themselves. We also hope to hold a
joint event with them, involving the
deaf children themselves, aimed at
getting good publicity for both of us.
We also had a problem in that
Alcoholics Anonymous apparently •
are completely self-financing and
don't accept outside contributions,
so we had to drop them from our list
of beneficiaries. Confused yet? Well
to clarify the situation, the money
raised will be divided as follows:
70% National Deaf Children's
Society (to buy 'Phonic Ears')
15% National Kidney Research Fund
15% British Heart Foundation
If you want to find out more about
any of these, please come and see
me and I can give you some leaflets.
Well, after all that rambling, I think
I'd better congratulate you on
having got this far, and rush
speedily to the end. So remember,
the success of the Rag this year
(can't we beat last year's net total of
£12,500?), depends on Y O U R
involvement; so come on the famous
tiddlywinks stunt on Saturday
(you'll hear all about it from your
CCU), come to the Rag meetings,
and you'll find it's all a lot of fun. ItS
also very worthwhile. See you
Saturday.

ICU Rag Chairman
CITY & GUILDS
Welcome to G U I L D S (you'll hear this
phrase a lot during the first week). This is the
first of, hopefully, weekly articles in F E L I X
by your overworked Publicity Officer which
will let you know what Guilds' events you
could go to.
The first event is after a morning of tedious
formal receptions, the G U I L D S ' Reception
at 2.30 p m on M o n d a y 1st. in the U n i o n
Building. Y o u will-have the chance to meet a
few of the people in G U I L D S and drink some
free beer, followed by a free guided tour of
downtown IC.
Tuesday sees the first U n i o n General
Meeting of the year. This is at 12.45 in M e c h .
Eng. 220. For those of you who want serious
discussion go to the I C U meeting, however
the G U I L D S U n i o n meeting will show you
how a U n i o n meeting should be run. There
will be examples of how to deal with boring
U n i o n Officers, Aeronautical Engineering
and paper folding ( paper darts to you) and
above all fun. Serious matters are also
discussed such as Academic Affairs (Boo!
Hiss!). They are not just for U n i o n Officers.
We rely on you to make G U I L D S the best
C C U at I C so make sure you're there so that
we can have the loudest B O O M A L A K A (the
G U I L D S ' chant) yet heard.
Tuesday afternoon is Freshers' Fair. Y o u
can wander round the stalls and see which
clubs and societies you would like to join.
Don't forget to visit the G U I L D S stall where
we will be willing to part you from your
money and give you sweatshirts and T-shirts
in various styles, sizes and colours in return.
Wednesday is left free for sports trials if you
are at all atheletic.
Thursday 4th. is the first Bar Night of the
term at 7.30 in the U n i o n Bar. This is an
event not to be missed at any cost. This is a
chance to let your hair down and make a fool
of yourself or just watch others doing so. A n
interesting evening of pleasent inbibing,
community singing (songs for all tastes) and
games (Boat Races on dry(?) land). In all a
worthwhile introduction to one of G U I L D S
many activities.
Saturday 6th. is the first R a g collection of
the year. Be at the U n i o n Office at 9.30 am to
collect your tiddlywinks and R a g cans and
then off to M a r b l e A r c h for a brisk wink to
Piccadilly Circus extorting money from the
shoppers for a good cause and stopping the
traffic. A dance round Eros at the end is
followed by relreshments in the Cockney
Pride. We are in competition with the other
C C U ' s so the more people that turn up the
better.
This has been a look at the fust week from a
Guildsperson's view and there is more to look
forward to such as a Pub C r a w l and a party in
the second week, solook out lor the posters
and Wotzon to see what is happening. If you
have any questions or just want to see how
G U I L D S runs just drop into the U n i o n
Office on level 3 M e c h . Eng., we don't bite
(with a few exceptions). We look forward to
seeing you at these events.
Bryan,
G U I L D S Publicity Officer.
