HOSTELLING ASSOCIATION
As stated in the IC Union Handbook,
Imperial College Youth Hostelling
Association (ICYHA) is the recreational
club you should join if you wish to 'get
away from it all'. One has only to look
back over the preceding year's activities
to see just how successful the club has
been in it's aim to flee from London.
During the autumn and spring terms
trips were arranged to the Brecons, Lake
district, Snowdonia, South Downs and
Yorkshire. A* Easter a party went to
Scotland, and forthree weeks during the
summer another trip to the Austrian
Tyrol and the Alsace region of France
was undertaken.
On arrival at our various destinations
people are free to do as they please. In
this way we hope to appeal to the walker,
c l i m b e r , s k i e r , c y c l i s t , c a n o e i s t ,
photographer and nature lover.
Travel is by minibus, and the transport
costs incurred are subsidised by the
R C C . Whilst away, we stay in Youth
Hostels, 'huts' or tents and take our own
food with us. In this way costs are
minimised.
In order to arrange ourtrips away, and
also to get to know other members of the
club, we meet on Thursday lunch times
in Southside Upper Lounge for 'butties'.
In addition to these rather informal
occasions, we do also visit some very
pleasant London restaurants to sample
'haute cuisine'.
Having wetted your appeitite then, we
look forward to seeing you at Freshers
Fair, where we will be only too pleased to
discuss our activities in more detail.

A MESSAGE FROM DRAMSOC
Imperial College Dramatic Society is a
congenial group of people who sit at the
top of the Union Building, make props,
drink tea, and watch the College go.
In return for this privilege we put on
2 1/2 productions a year, organise the
l i g h t i n g for n u m e r o u s p a r t i e s
(everything from Fred's 21st to the
Silwood Annual Ball) and go on theatre
visits.
Dramsoc can be found on the Union
East Staircase (above the Union Office)
on the floor below the top.The door is
usually open and tea is always brewing.
In particular we are short of people
willing to work backstage, no previous
experience needed.
Actors welcome.
Actresses particularly welcome.

RAILWAY SOCIETY
To most people the mention of
'Railway Society' immediately conjures
up visions of spotty little kids in scruffy
macs standing on railway stations
making a lot of noise and scribbling
down train numbers.
In ICRS this image is very far from the
truth, and to prove it the society
undertook a continental tour this
summer.- It proved to be a veritable
cultural feast incorporating s u c h
Meccas of the railway scene as
Beauvais Cathedral, Eiffel Tower, Notre
Dame, Arc de Triomphe, a Jazz concert,
various Spanish swimming pools and
beaches, Bastille Day celebrations and a
considerable quantity of local vino. The
whole expedition was undertaken in a
college minibus and we camped at a
number of off-beat places. We ate like
Lords, enjoying Waitrose soup, raviolli
meatballs and marmalade deep in the
Spanish interior. Among our major
discoveries were that the Spanish don't
call beer-beer, which caused not a few
problems early on.
In our spare time we even managed to
visit one preserved and two industrial
railways which were operated by steam
locomotives.
If you want to hear more about this
trip, and the events which have been
arranged for this session, including a
talk on the first ever trip by British
enthusiasts to China (they ended up
visiting a wide range of porcelain
f a c t o r i e s ) , c o m e a l o n g to our
Introductory Meeting at 5.40pm in Mech
Eng 640 on Tuesday 9 October.
IC ISLAMIC SOCIETY

them at the FRESHER' FAIR
The Committee will be pleased to help
anyone with difficulties in performing
an Islamic way of life - see us at the fair.

BRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETY -
IMPERIAL COLLEGE DETATCHMENT
The Imperial College British Red
Cross Society is unique in that it is the
only such establishment within a
University campus in the British Isles. It
consists of a Voluntary Aid Detachment
and a Members' Group.
The Voluntary Aid Detachment is
made up of uniformed personnel
qualified in First Aid and Nursing who
provide First Aid facilities as required
within the London area.
We have recently acquired a Ford
Transit Ambulance, furnished with the
most up-to-date equipment which is
based here at Imperial College and may
be found parked beneath the Sherfield
building.
The Members' Group primarily acts as
a social welfare volunteers group within
the local community: hospital visiting,
escorting disabled and elderly persons
and assisting with the mentally
handicapped.
The Society provides opportunities
for any member of the College, whether
students or staff, to learn First Aid and
Nursing and invites You to come along
and learn how to cope in the event of an
accident or illness.
We are holding an Introductory
Meeting on THURSDAY 4th OCTOBER
at 6.30pm in the Botany/Zoology
Common Room (under the Union Arch),
where you will have an opportunity to
see what courses are available, to meet
with existing members and to inspect
the Detachment ambulance.
See us at Freshers' Fair on the
Queen's Lawn and in the Bot/Zoo
Common Room and watch out here in
F E L I X for f u t u r e R e d C r o s s
announcements.
