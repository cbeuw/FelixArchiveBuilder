Why do you need a bank account?
As a student, you have a fixed amount of money to
live on. Therefore, you need the most efficient means
available of handling your money-a bank account.
Lloyds Bank, at the sign of the Black Horse, is not only
a safe place to keep your money. Once you have a Lloyds
Bank account, you have a clear idea of where you stand
financially from day to day, an easy means of buying
things and paying bills, and a readily available source of
expert financial advice, all in the strictest confidence and
the friendliest, most helpful way. We give this complete
service from the very day you open your account.
This booklet explains some of the services Lloyds
offers which could be of use to you when you open a
current account.
A current account for dayto'day
money management
A current account is the most convenient method
you will find for dealing with your everyday financial
matters. And you'll find it really easy to open an account
with Lloyds, at any branch. The first thing you get is a
cheque book, so that when you pay in your grant cheque
or other funds at the start of each term you can draw
cash, pay bills and keep track of what you've spent as the
term progresses. And you'll get regular statements giving
an accurate record of every transaction.
Free banking
As long as you are a full-time student, we'll look
after your account free of charge, provided you stay in
credit. And it's worth noting that if you arrange an
overdraft of up to £50 we'll still nan your account free of
bank charges. Although you will, of course, pay interest
on the loan.
Cashpoint for cash-fast
Cashpoint is a special Lloyds cash dispenser that is
available for use in hundreds of our branches throughout
Great Britain, including many branches on or near
university and college campuses. With your Cashpoint
card, issued free to all current account customers, you
can draw out cash at the touch of a button-up to £100 a
day if your account can stand it. Several department stores
in major towns and cities also have Cashpoint, allowing
our customers cash withdrawal facilities when they are
open-that includes Saturdays. A n increasing number of
our branches have Cashpoint outside, which means that
customers can use the machine six days a week outside
banking hours.

The Cheque Card
A Cheque Card carries your name, a specimen of
your signature and your card number. When you want
to pay by cheque for shop purchases, travel tickets,
restaurant bills, for instance, or you want to cash a
cheque for yourself in a bank branch other than your
own, the Cheque Card confirms to the person taking
your cheque that Lloyds Bank will honour it-up to £50
for any one transaction. It saves you having to carry too
much cash.
Of course, they're not issued to new customers
automatically. Being given one is purely at the discretion
of your bank manager. But anyone over 18 can apply for
one at the branch where the account is kept.
