In a letter to the Union's
Sabbaticals, Diana Hamilton-
F a i r l e y , this y e a r s U L U
President, writes,"This year is
going to be a year of extreme
difficulty for the student
movement."
The attacks, she says,"are
not only going to come from
the Government but also from
the University centrally and
from each college." She
continues,"If we are going to
not only maintain our present
position but improve it we
must be seen to act in a unified
manner and not as fragments
in little bits and pieces. The
c a m p a i g n s we w i l l be
organising this year concern
every student in London and
this must be reflected in our
strategies for campaigns."
