Opening an account at Lloyds couldn't be easier.
To simplify it as much as possible, just use the
special account opening card attached.
Complete the card and take it to any Lloyds branch.
They can either make arrangements to open an account
for you there, or for an account to be opened at a branch
near where you'll actually be studying. (There's likely to be
a Lloyds branch very close to your college, or even on
the campus.) Then, when you want to bank your grant
cheque, or other funds, you'll have an account ready
and waiting with no extra formalities to go through.
Once you have opened your account, you will be
able to call in and have a word with the manager at any
time about difficulties which might arise. You'll find he
understands the problems that students face, and will be
very happy to see you and discuss your needs. A n d he'll
soon show you there's a lot more than money at the sign
of the Black Horse.
