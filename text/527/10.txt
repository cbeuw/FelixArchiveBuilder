Welcome to London -and Welcome to
ULU I
As a student in London you have the
unique advantage of not only belonging
to your college or school union but also
to ULU - your intercollegiate union.
The ULU building is the place where you
can meet students from all over London,
not just the ones from your college or
hall of residence-
There are three sabbatical officers for
the 1979-60 session - elected to represent
you. These are the President, Diana
Hamilton-Fairley, and the two Vice
Presidents, Ian Heap and Deborah Perkin.
Don't hesitate to contact them for advice,
During your college freshers week we
hope to be visiting you on our ULU FUN
BUS, and we shall be making welcoming
speeches along with your own union
officers. Don't miss out on your copy
of the London Student Guide (published
in conjunction with Time Out and other
student organisations in London) -
available free on the FUN BUS or from
the ULU building itself, with more
details of student services in London.
