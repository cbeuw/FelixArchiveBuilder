Sirs,
In this discussion I shall
attempt to analyse as opposed to
describe aspects of the structure of
this union. W e are all aware that
the checks and balances which
exist between different sections of
the U n i o n makes for a relatively
democratic institution in that no
extreme view can predominate
for long. However, the very
process ol particular sections o f
the union ensuring that their
respective positions are advanced,
or at least not eroded, means that
we are distracted from observing
the existence ol attitudes common
to many sections o f t h e
union. In this essay I hope to
correct this imbalance to a certain
extent. O n e of the attitudes
prescient among various sections
of the union is in my view what I
shall call anti-intellectualism.
T h e most notable offenders in this
respect are institutions such as the
C C U s and the Rugby C l u b ; it has
been realised for some time that
they attempt to degrade those
people who join them with such
events as t h e i r i n i t i a t i o n
ceremonies. Smoking Concerts pi
doubtful entertainment value,
and. if the latest example is any-
thing to judge by, rag mags which
can only be described as products
of sick minds. But these are only
symptoms of a creeping disease
which attempts to cast people,
a n d p e o p1e at a v e r y
impressionable age. in the same
mould, the people who belong to
and r u n the C C U s are afraid of
individuality since this threatens
their paranoid grasp of these
reprehensible institutions. T h e
worst example ol this desire lot
uniformity is in their approach to
the intellect: they do not
consciously realise that they are
anti-intellectual, since they are
not adult enough to do so. Anyone
who is seen taking an interest in
tti"ir academic work, as opposed
to the m i n i m u m amount required
by the examiners, or some other
activity not approved by the
C C L s. is viewed with great
distrust because that person
refuses to be taken in by the tribal
hollcrings ol the C C l ' s . Given
that i n t e l l e c t u a l s w i l l not
participate in the pernicious
activities ol the C C l s then it
follows that non-intellectuals and
in many cases anti-intellectuals
will lake charge ol the C C l s and
thus perpetuate the system to
clone their own kind ol beer-
s w i l l i n g l o u t . T h e y t h u s
perpetuate the worst aspect ol the
English public school tradition
being " a l l chaps together",
something Freud would have no
doubt ascribed to a latent
homosexual desire, and at the
same lime despise the intellectual
side ol the same public school
tradition so that il is entirely
destroyed. The situation would
not be so bad Were il not for the
fact that because they are so
prominent within the college and
appeal to the basest instincts of
people, people join them before
they have a chance of discovering
the C C U s true nature or the
range of available alternatives.
Once in a C C l ' all chance of
doing something different is
immediately denied.
Il is therefore evident that these
organisations are detrimental to
the life of individual students
within the college. I suggest that
consequently they are in breach of
o u r b y - l a w s a n d s e r i o u s
consideration should be given to
the abolition of the C C l s.

C o p y Date for next
Friday's issue
.... you've missed it!
Last Friday I went into
Southside Refectory for a meal. I
had stuffed aubergine. According
to the price list it cost 67p. W i t h
the aubergine you get a certain
amount of rice. I asked for extra
rice. I then asked lor chips as well.
I went to pay. I found I had
sinned.Having rice means you
haven't really had the second
vegetable which the menu says is
included in the price. Therefor
you pay six pence less than the
menu price.. But rice is an extra
vegetable over and above the two
allowed which costs 14p. so you
pay 8p more than the menu price.
For this reason, my"Mooney"cost
me 75p. IIT didn't have rice, but
peas, I would have paid 67p. Y o u
may be utterly confused. T h e
point is this; If, in Southside, you
have main course plus two veg.
vou pay menu price. If you have 3"
veg. you pay H p more. If you
have 1 veg. you pay 6p less. If the
meal costs 70p, the veg costs 28p,
so the meat bit costs 42p. If you
don't have any veg. at all you pay,
according to the rules, 6p less for
every veg. you don't have, leaving
58p. T h e meat costs 42p, a gap of
16p. Dear Freshers, go and pay
Mooney 16p for no meal
whatsoever.
Seriously, if M r . Mooney can
explain this anomoly, I would be
very pleased.
Yours sincerely,
Nick Davies.
Dear Colin,
Please could you put
this information in the Freshers'
issue of F E L I X : -
Tuesday, 2nd. October at
7.30pm. in the J C R there will be
the Life Sciences Freshers' Party
(admission will be free for Life
Sciences Freshers - others must
bring a bottle after the bar closes)
II you need a space tiller please
put the above somewhere else as
well (I'm terrified no-one will
turn up!).

Sir,
H a v i n g spent the late Bank-
Holiday weekend in Paris mv
thoughts have turned to banning
all smoking on the Underground
system. This would result in a
cleaner environment for all. T h e
Metro is an example, in many
ways to our tube system. T h e
Metro rule ol no smoking is
adhered to by all travellers and
has demonstrated the need for
such a policy here.
Yours Faithfully,
Roger Stotesbury.
Sirs.
Why, in the bottom right
hand corner of the Letters Page, is
there always a letter pretending
not to be a space liller:'
Yours Esoterically,
Eric Jarvis. R.I.P.
