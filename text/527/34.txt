Dear Student,
The accompanying l e a f l e t t e l l s you about the range of help and
services we provide to a s s i s t you through your student days and,
hopefully, beyond.
If you are up at Imperial College f o r the f i r s t time t h i s year,
and open a current account with Lloyds Bank before the 31st
October 1979, we s h a l l give you either a voucher, worth £4, o f f
a B r i t i s h R a i l Student Railcard, or a £4 Book Token.
There i s a special l e a f l e t on these offers at any branch of
Lloyds Bank, and we at South Kensington Branch would be
p a r t i c u l a r l y happy to see you.
Drop i n and ask f o r me, Tom Finlay, or Mark Bennison.
