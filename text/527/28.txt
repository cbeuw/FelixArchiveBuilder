IMPERIAL C O L L E G E C H I N E S E
SOCIETY
CALLING ALL SINOPHILES, ABOUT
OUR SOCIETY ....
Among the several aims of this
society, the noblest has to be to
p r o m o t e c u l t u r a l e x c h a n g e s . '
Frequently, we are kept pretty busy just
by trying to look after the recreational
needs of our m e m b e r s , whether
intellectually or physically as in sports.
In other words, we are here to create
chances so that everyone can come
together and have a good time!
Our list of the year's events-agenda
runs from the annual 'Chinese New Year
Celebrations' and the 'Farewell Patty', to
the once in a while sightseeing trips,
C h i n e s e film s h o w s and regular
Badminton practice sessions â€” in
readiness for the annual IC - U C
(University College) Games as well as
for enjoyment. We lost to U C C S last
year, but with the help of you new
members we will hopefully show those
guys a thing or two this year!
By the way, we are ICCS, I hope you
can work out what U C C S is by now.
Then there are the weekly Lunch-time
gatherings! These are opportunities for
you to chat with yourfriends (or new
friends) over a cup of after-lunch tea
(usually provided), play a game of
Chinese chess or even grip to the ever-
present committee members to run
things better ... We also welcome any
wild suggestions and construcitve
criticism. There will also be a wide range
of magazines at hand; from the 'Ming
Pao Monthly' to 'China Reconstruct',
and a Malaysian Literal monthly to a
Hong Kong comic.
The emphasis is on good fellowship,
you can talk in Chinese, write in
Chinese, or even play in Chinese with
fellow Chinese students when you want
to. Of course, you can also learn about
the Chinese (we do have some members
of non-Chinese students), as we hope to
have more non-Chinese members as
well as Chinese members!
So if you do fear that you will go nuts
with boredom during your spare time
and would like to unwind with fellow
Chinese students, then please come to
see us at the Freshers Fair and at our
private fresher's reception... and even
join us.

C O P Y DEADLINE
T O M O R R O W 5:00pm.
The final bow at the end of a Bowling
club production.
IC TENPIN BOWLING CLUB
The IC Tenpin Bowling Club has a
membership that extends from the
beginner upwards. Our bowling is based
around a trios league every Wednesday
a f t e r n o o n in term time at the
Charrington Bowl Tolworth (host of
many national and international
tournaments in recent years.)
Members of the club also spend the
o c c a s i o n a l S u n d a y t r a v e l l i n g to
tournaments at other universities or
participating in the U C T B A inter-
universities competition. IC provides
most of the members of the University of
London Bowling Team, consisting of up
to 15 men and at least 5 ladies. Last
season the team did fairly well at this
level of competition (the 'A' Team which
was comprised of the top 5 bowlers, did
exceptionally well). Members of the
team took many of the individual
honours, the London team having a high
proportion of the better bowlers in the
"competition. This year we hope to raise
the standard of the team as a whole in
order to build on this success.
We meet outside the entrance to Aero-
Eng (Opposite Beit Archway) to catch
the club coach at 2.30 on Wednesday
afternoons.
Bowling will start on the second
Wednesday of term with casual party
bowling, the league should start the
following week. So whether you have a
180 average or just bowl for fun IC
Tenpin Bowling Club could be the thing
for you.
If you're interested (or could get
interested) come and see us at our stall
at Freshers Fair, or contact me through
the internal mail.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE BILLIARDS AND
SNOOKER CLUB
On the behalf of my committee, I
would like to welcome you to IC ... but I
won't: you freshers' must be fed up with
all these people you don't know
welcoming you to IC. So all I'll do is just
say:'Hi! guys and gals', and tell you why
you should join the snooker club.
Firstly, we are the most popular
recreational club at IC, and we provide
the best value for money (membership
for one year is only 75p). We are also one
of the most successful clubs (we have
won the League every season, and one
of our members has always won the
annual London Colleges' Champion-
ships).
This year, we will be organising a trip
to .go and see Benson and Hedges
competition. We will also be organising
trips to go to Bennett's, one of the big
snooker shops: we have arranged with
them a 10% discount on all purchases.
Lastly, we will be giving lessons in
how to play snooker;
Lesson 1.: For total beginners, to beheld
approx. once a week during term-time.
Lesson 2: For those who have completed
lesson 1, to be held approx. once a
fortnight during term-time.
The object of these lessons is to
improve the standard of snooker at IC,
and to introduce people to a great form
of relaxation. These lessons are open to
all members of IC; ie students and staff.
You do not have to be a member of the
snooker club to attend these lessons
(though you will' have to join if you want
to use the tables afterwards). These
lessons are free, and tuition will be given
by members of the first team and of the
committee.
Lastly once again, the Freshers'
tournament will be held within the next
fortnight. Notice will be given in FELIX.
See you all at the Freshers' fair, I hope
(Snooker lounge is on the third floor of
union).
