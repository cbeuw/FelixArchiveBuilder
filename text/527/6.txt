Boanerges, (Bo' for short) is the
affectionate name used by City
and Guilds Union when referring
to its 1902 James and Browne car.
Only one of two of its marque
remaining, the vehicle is indeed a
valuable piece of our national
heritage, and has been at the
College since 1933. Very aptlv
named after the sons of thunder.
Bo is regularly seen rumbling
around the neighbourhood and
on special occasions further afield.
Bonersjes is the second ear to be
so-called the fust being a 1908
Rover which was disposed of
around about 1930 when it
became ineligible for the annual

the result was a speeding ticket!
That was the year that Brockbank

subject for a front cover of
Punch. Today, Bo' is used less for
student rags and such, in
deference to its age, and is being
preserved in a manner more
befitting to a septuagenarian. T h e

For the mechanics amongst
you, the engine and gearboxes (!)
are somewhat unusual for the
time. Constructed mainly of
aluminium castings with cast iron
cylinders, the engine is a
horizontal parallel transverse
twin of two and a half litres (9hp
for y o u o l d - t i m e r s ) . T h e
gearboxes (both of them!) sit
either side ofthe main drive gears
and the differential which powers
the rear wheel by means of chains
that would bring a smile to any
Hell's Angel's face. Designed by a
Monsieur Martineau, this novel

production for more than a few
years, the company reverted to an
upright in line four, this bringing
about their demise. It is believed
that James and Browne still trade
as gunsmiths in Hammersmith.
