be an amusing game on the
surface, but to the ladles of ICWA
It was a deliberate campaign
calculated to provide a handy

guide to the personalities,
characters of the unsuspecting
Icwarlans. A group called
CLEOPATRAS NEEDLE re-
taliated by compiling the
"WA LLULK rating "to help a girl to
separate the wolf Irom the sheep,
and to make an accurate
assessment of any man.
The score opposite each question
applies to the positive answer, i.e.
"yes". N o marks are given for an

RATINGS
225-150: Professional bachelor,
rake, Casanova etc - doomed to
be lonely to old age if he doesn't
watch out. Likes his liquor
straight, his cars and women fast.
Not to be trusted. Dynamite to the
weaker of the weaker sex - well left
alone.
150 - 50: Dangerous; unbeatably
a t t r a c t i v e , u n b e l e l v a b l y i n -
telligent, unutterably charming,
all male - so he tells you. Also
unbearably conceited. Improves
with o l d age, specially if left in
cold storage.
0 and neighbourhood: The golden
mean. N o more need be said1
-50 - -205: Completely dom-
esticated, will not cause any
trouble. No worry about a wolf in
sheep's clothing here
