Roger didn't like the
other photo, so here's
a better one. (Roger's

JUST
A
SEC
I trust your're enjoying your first day at
College. My own recollection, of two
years ago, is one of endless queues,
endless talks and an evening initially
spent witn one of my predecessors.
Let me begin by introducing myself; I
like Stanley Kubrick, Sloanes, the
Purple Hearts, candlelight and breaking
into parent's houses. I hate the
Underground,"Charlie", tinned food,
watching television and Capital Radio.
I'm living in Keogh Hall, Room 388.
My job in the Union is one of
c o m m u n i c a t i o n ( ! - e d ) , p l a n n i n g ,
servicing and dealing with the ind'vidual
needs of Union members. I can be found
in the Union Office, in the Beit building,
so please come over if you think that
there is anything we can do for you. An
especially good time to come is during
the Fresher's Fair.
This is the first of a number of articles
which will appear this year- hopefully
even if they don't make your pulse
quicken they will at least keep you
actively involved.
The First Week
Here's a list of things you should/must
do in the first week here:
1. Register in College
2. Get an IC Union card(you will need a
passport photo) and donate 50p to the
W U S Scholarship Appeal
3. Collect Grant Cheque
4. T a k e part in D e p a r t m e n t a l
photograph
5. Complete Medical Card & Medical
History Card
6. Get a locker in your department
7. Give your address to the departmental
office
8. Start a bank account
9. (If applicable) Fill in Parking Permit
application form before 5pm. Friday
10. Attend Fresher's Fair
11. Attend the Union General Meeting
The First Union Meeting
Yes folks, don't be late, join the queue
and rub shoulders with those who have
learnt that U G M s are perhaps the
ultimate use of one's time. It all happens
at 1pm on Thursday in the Great Hall.
Last year saw an increase in the number
of people turning up for U G M s and I
hope this trend will continue. After all, if
you want to make your voice heard, a
really effective way is to turn up and vote
on the issues that affect you. Detais of
U G M s will be found in EXEC NEWS
which is distributed to all departments.
The First Elections
Yes, you've guessed it, some of these
are caused by exam failures(We wish
Andy, John, Andy and Scott ah the best).
The posts open now are:
a) FELIX Editor- which will beelected by
College wide ballot over two days.
b) Elec. Eng. Departmental Represent-
ative- elected by a one day ballot in the
department
c) M i n . R e s . E n g . D e p . R e p .
d) Management Science Dep. Rep
e) 3 ordinary members of the Academic
Affairs Commitee- elected during U G M
on 16th Oct.
f) 2 ordinary members of the Union
finance Committee
g) 2 ordinary members of the Comunity
Action Group
h) 3 ordinary members of London
Student Travel Committee
The papers for all these posts are up in
either the Union Lower Lounge or the
respective department, so if you fancy
standing for one of these posts, find out
what it entails and get a proposer and
seconders.
The First Duplicating Demonstration
To use one of the Union Gestetner
Duplicators, which are situated in the
FELIX Office, you must have attended
one of this year's demonstrations. The
first is on Monday,8th October at 1pm in
the FELIX Office. So Secretaries of clubs
and societies don't forget. On the same
subject, you will be able to obtain keys
for the duplicators(providing that you
have registered) and ink and paper from
me in the Union Office.
Well, that's all for now. Hope to meet
you soon and have a great time.

GERMAN MEASLES AND
PREGNANCY
As part of a national campaign to
promote rubella (German measles)
vaccination and thus further to reduce
the number of congenially handi-
capped babies, the Health Centre offers
rubella vaccination to all women under
40 in College and particularly to
students. All women are invited to attend
the Health Centre between 10 and 10.30
am on Wednesdays in the Autumn Term
for an initial blood test to determin if
they have immunity (whetheror notthey
have had rubella vaccination already).
Those who have no immunity will then
be sent an appointment for the
vaccination.
PG TIPS
For Fresher P G s . There is no better
introduction to the existing ones than to
come along to our bar night on
Wednesday, 3rd October, starting at
6:00 p.m. in Stan's Bar, Southside. all
'old' P G s are, of course, equally
welcome.
All Fresher P G s are automatically
members of the IC Postgraduate Group,
which exists to promote the welfare of
P G s a n d to e n s u r e a d e q u a t e
s o c i a l i z a t i o n a m o n g s t t h e m .
Ploughman's lunches, bar nights and a
trip to Cambridge were part of our
agenda last year.
It is important for Freshers to
participate in activities outside of 'run-
of-the-mill' research and, in addition, to
the P G Group, there are many other
societies you may join. Look out for the
"Associated Studies" booklet which
gives details of many interesting films,
lectures, concerts etc. - you should find
something to interest you in that.
If, during your first weeks here, you
find anything puzzling, distasteful or
even wonderful about postgraduate life
here, do not hesitate to let either myself
or one of my colleagues know about it.
We will be available to discuss the
activities of the P G Group with you at
our stall in Freshers Fair (Tuesday, 2nd
October - Malcolm tells me it will be in
Sherfield Lower Refectory).
If you can't make it to that, then come
along to the bar night on Wednesday.
See you amongst the' London Pride and
ESB (drinks are subsidised to the tune of
lOp per pint).

P G Affairs Officer
