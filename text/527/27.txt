P. FRESHERS* GUIDE TO U.IION GENERAL MEETINGS (U.G.M. ' S)
Introduction.
Union General Meetings decide overall policy of the
Union and also provide the Union with the opportunity of "checking up" on i t s
officers. UGM's are conducted according to a set o f standing orders.
The Chair.
It i s the job of the Chairperson to ensure that the meeting i s kept i n order i . e .
that i t i s conducted according to the Standing Orders.
If you feel thet the meeting i s not being conducted correctly you should:-
a. Make a "point of order'. That i s to question whether a Standing Order i s
being properly complied with.
b. I f you disagree with the Chairperson's r u l i n g then you should challenge
his/her r u l i n g .
Standing Orders.
Standing Orders d e t a i l how motions and amendments should be taken.
Information.
Standing Orders also define how to ask questions or give information. To do
this shout "Information" and i f the speaker accepts your point of Information you
w i l l be allowed to speak (These points of information are not allowed at a l l
during a summing up speech).
Procedural Motions. (See section 20 of Standing Orders)
If you get bored with a p a r t i c u l a r motion or i f you think a wrong decision was
taken on a previous matter or i f you want to do something that Standing Orders
does not allow you to do or i f you want the meeting to end and items on the agenda
to go to another one or i f you want to discuss a particular motion at a later
meeting or i f you don't l i k e a particular speaker or i f you don't want to vote on
a_particular amendment, you can move one of the procedural motions l i s t e d i n
Section 20.
Procedural Motions can be moved at any time during a debate as long as someone i s
not speaking at the time. The acceptance of a procedural motion however i s at the
Chairpersons d i s c r e t i o n .
It i s nomal practise to take one speech i n favour and one against procedural
motions and then a vote.
Agenda.
Agenda i s usually in following order:
a. Minutes of t*tt Meeting.
This i s merely to check that the minutes produced are a true record of the
last meeting.
b. Officers Reports.
Officers reports are presented so that you can check that an officer i s
f u l f i l l i n g the job as detailed in her/his job description and as previous
Union General Meetings have requested. Most reports w i l l be in sections:
i ) Questions to reports: If you do not understand a section of the report,
and feel i t i s not detailed enough you can ask a question to the
Officer concerned.
i i ) Moving Back of Reports: If you are s t i l l not s a t i s f i e d you can move
back a section of the report. "Moving Back" simply means that the
Union does not accept that a report either because action taken was
inappropriate or because i t was i n s u f f i c i e n t . Reports sometimes
contain proposals which arc voted on seoerately.
c. Motions: Any member of the Union, who can find a seconder ran out a motion
to a Union Meeting.
Motions handed i n 7 days before the meeting must always appear on the agenda.
Other motions are only accepted at the Chairpersons d i s c r e t i o n .
After a proposing speech has been made to a motion ANYBODY (who can find
a seconder) CAN MOVE AN AMENDMENT. Write the amendment down and hand i t
to the Chair then you w i l l get the opportunity to sp^ak to amendments.
Only one amendment i s discussed at any one time.
If an amendment i s passed i t replaces the o r i g i n a l motion and becomes the
"Substantive" motion. Amendments can continue to be made to the substantive.
After a l l amendments have been taken there i s discussion on the substantive
motion.
Only when the motion i t s e l f i s passed has the Union adopted any p o l i c y .
Any motion can be passed as long as i t does not contradict tbe By-Laws,
or i t s appendices or the Standing Orders. However a l l these documents can
be amended by procedures outlined i n them.
