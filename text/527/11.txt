where you can watch in gut-rending
anticipation as the Daring ULU
Mountaineers absail down the sirfe or
of Senate House, where you can re-
capture those blissful holiday moments
in Greece as you sway to the exotic
rhythms of The Hellenic Society, where
you can explore the mysterious depths of
the ULU swimming pool, courtesy of the

ulu ents
To try and describe ULU ENTS in such a l
a small space is like trying to engrave
'War & Peace' on a pin-head. The last
person to cttempt thr latter was Helmut
Schule, a Bavarian Postmaster - plucky
Helmut got half way through Part III
before being wheeled off to the Sanit-
orium. So, at great risk to my sanity ,
I will say, briefly, that ULU ENTS
provide the best in live entertainment -
their Balls are ballsier, their discos are
discoe-er, their films are filmier and
their prices are faintly ridiculous. Come
along to ULU and be ENTertained. N . b .
if you fancy yourself as a ligger/groupie
why not join the ENTS committee, and
gob at your favourite stars from close-
range. You even get paid for enjoying
yourself.
Makes Studio 57 look like a Church Hall
Dance. A dazzling combination of
night-club, disco and live music set
against an irridescent back-drop of
cinematographic phenonmena. Wine and
wine your new found chums in the
decadent atmosphere of "Chez ULU"
London's newest trendiest and swingingest
nite-spot where everything is extravagent
except for the prices! Every night from
Monday 8th to Thursday 1 lth'Chez ULU"
will open its exclusive doors at 8.00pm,
to reveal its plush interior pulsing with
vibrant music from a different band every
night and a Disco Sounc. System so
devastating that detente with the USSR
is severely threatene . W A R N I N G -
"Chez ULU" mcy contain scenes which
will shock and disgust those of nervous
dispositions and they are strongly
advised to stay at home with a mug of
warm milk and a digestive biscuit. ^\
autumn ball J |
The night no one can afford to miss.
Friday 12th October sees the first great
ULU extravaganza of the year when the
floors heave and the building sways to
the strains of the best music around and
students put their health at risk in the
crush for bands, dancing, films and food.
Presented in glorious technicolour, the
season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
myth is exploded as ULU's autumn takes
off in a heat-wave of frolicks, fizz and
frenetic decadence.
Come and jive with hundreds of students
from all over London, watch the midnight
movie with your best friends or share
intimate moments over autumnal edibles
with your newest lover.
