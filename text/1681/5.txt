I
n today’s 140-char-
acter world, it’s
all too easy to blur
the line between
fact and fiction, and
apply false assumptions
leading to fallacious
beliefs”.
When we opened the
Felix edition containing
an article entitled “A
response to those who
criticise the Balfour Dec-
laration”, we were eager
to read on: an opinion
most likely opposing our
own, and written by two
Imperial students – thus
presumably logically
thought out and supported
by evidence. What better
way of challenging one’s
own beliefs? Unfor-
tunately, we got as far
the second paragraph
before we began to find
misrepresentations of
well-known statistics
alongside unsubstantiated
arguments and sweeping
generalisations through-
out the article.
Because the authors
will not hear from us
what Zionism is, then
let’s take a closer look
at Theodor Herzl’s
proposals for a Jewish
homeland – the very same
man that coined the idea
of Zionism. Herzl himself
stated that antisemitism
could not be defeated or
cured, only avoided, and
that the only way to avoid
it was the establishment
of a Jewish state. These
claims were made by
him after witnessing the
blatant anti-Semitism that
was present at the Dreyfus
case in Paris. Beginning
in late 1895, Herzl wrote
Der Judenstaat (The
State of the Jews). The
book argued that the
Jewish people should
leave Europe either for
Argentina or, preferably,
for Palestine, their historic
homeland, if they wished
to. Herzl then negotiated
with the British regard-
ing the possibility of
settling the Jews on the
island of Cyprus, the El
Arish region in the Sinai
Peninsula in Egypt, and
Uganda. So, quite clearly,
the establishment of a
Jewish homeland in Pal-
estine specifically was not
his utmost priority, since,
although he mentions
Argentina or Palestine
as choices, he generally
refers to the location of
The land of Palestine
was one of his choices
due to historic ties with
the Jewish religion; but
this is not something
surprising, since all three
Abrahamic religions have
historic ties with the land
of Palestine – it’s the place
where Jesus Christ was
born, died, and buried,
and where the Prophet
Mohammed is said to
have travelled to from
Mecca, and then ascended
to heaven from the Al
Aqsa Mosque (located in
Jerusalem). Palestine and
Jerusalem are holy sites
of the three Abrahamic
religions, hence none of
them should have a larger
claim over this land than
the other two. This is
something acknowledged
by Herzl himself, as well
as Arthur Balfour when
he signed the declaration.
So we return back to the
same question posed in
the initial article: Why is
it then, that Palestinians
have suffered ethnic
cleansing, and exist as
second class citizens in
the state in Israel?
What the authors of
the response to our article
(including those who
are underage), torture
tactics are being carried
out during interrogations,
there’s a ridiculously long
list of discriminatory laws
existing against Arab
citizens in Israel, the
separation wall is twice as
tall and four times longer
than the former Berlin
Wall, and yes, ethnic
cleansing did happen, it’s
called Al Nakba – in 1948
750,000 Palestinians were
forcibly displaced from
their homes, with another
300,000 refugees being
displaced after 1967; as
of 2015, for the UN Relief
and Works Agenecy
for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA) mandate there
are 5 million Palestinian
refugees.
So no, these are not
“sweeping generalisa-
tions” or “buzzwords”
these are facts, that the
writers purposely chose
to ignore because it suited
their political agenda.
Every single listed vio-
lation of human rights
above has been well-doc-
umented, so if you will
not take it from us, the
oppressed, maybe sources
like Humans Right
Watch, UNRWA, Unicef,
Haaretz, and Wikipedia
will be valid enough.
And since the authors
cited people that have
experienced the South
African Apartheid, maybe
they will find Nelson
Mandela’s view on the
conflict relevant: “we
know too well that our
freedom is incomplete
without the freedom of the
Palestinians.”

“There are
countless cases
of random
searches and
detentions

hours of the
night”
have answered is a pure
blatant denial of these
facts, ignoring the stories
of displaced families
living in refugee camps,
or children in Gaza with
no access to clean water
or electricity because the
supply is being cut by
Israel when they please.
There are countless cases
of young Palestinian boys
and girls being attacked
by illegal Israeli settlers,
checkpoints that only
Palestinians have to go
through in order to carry
out daily activities such
as going to work, and
random searches and de-
tentions carried out at late
hours of the night.
Palestinians are being
held in prison without
trials or accusations
“Palestine and
Jerusalem are
holy sites of
three religions,
hence none
should have
a larger claim
over the
others”
the state as “over there” in
his book, and considered
four other possible areas.
