Killer robots, memory scanners, and self-driving pizza
Charlie Brooker is back, with six new episodes of his dark sci-fi anthology. But how do these episodes compare to
seasons past? We take you through the highs, the lows, and the weird.

“‘Arkangel’
stands out as
one of only
two episodes
anywhere near
the quality
of earlier
seasons”
Black Mirror’s fourth
season kicks off with a
turn away from the dark,
nihilistic tones of earlier
seasons, opting instead
for a campy parody of a
sci-fi classic. Many critics
have hailed the opening
episode as the best of the
season and it’s easy to see
why: the story is cohesive,
engaging, and well deliv-
ered. In the context of any
show other than Black
Mirror, ‘USS Callister’
would comfortably pass
by unnoticed.
However, Black Mirror
is not just any other show,
and a passable episode that
lacks the edge that fans
have come to expect from
creator Charlie Brooker
should not come anywhere
near the premiere to a new
season. Were ‘USS Callis-
ter’ in any of the show’s
previous seasons, I would
expect to find it tucked
away as fourth or fifth
billing, so as not to call
attention to itself. Unfor-
tunately, Season 4 already
has those positions of
mediocrity filled by shy,
average episodes, so a
sappy Star Trek parody
is dropped into first place
– and ‘USS Callister’defi-
nitely is more parody than
homage, complete with
snipes at its predecessor’s
indulgence of young male
fantasies and simple set
design. It does, however,
use this precis to make
an interesting comparison
between the ‘nerdy virgin’
stereotype of the ‘80s and
‘90s, and the ‘virgin neck-
beard’ of today, a link that
is left largely unexplored.
Unlike the majority
of Black Mirror’s many
horror stories, this
camp fireside tale has a
happy ending, with very
little lost. For a show
that thrives on its dark
warnings against tech, this
is an odd choice, and the
thematic shift away from
skepticism is mirrored in
other episodes across this
season. This episode isn’t
the first to end on a wholly
happy note, as ‘San
Junipero’ from season 3
ends with a wholesome
romance. However,
‘USS Callister’ does not
share the slow reveal of
information leading to an
engaging twist that gave
‘San Junipero’ its compel-
ling narrative. AM
The disappointing
aftertaste of ‘USS Cal-
lister’ is immediately
remedied with a return to
what Brooker does best:
introducing a plausible
technology and allowing
the characters’ own deci-
sions on how they use it to
be the force that drives the
story forward. Showing
us how humans naturally
abuse the abilities that
technology facilitate
makes for a much scarier
reality than the Tech ex
Machina deployed in
episodes like ‘Metalhead’.
However, some may
see the moral points raised
in Jodie Foster’s directing
debut as obvious, and
less complex than similar
episodes from previous
seasons. I find that this is
an unfair analysis: what
Black Mirror excels at is
buckling us in, letting us
know where the episode
is headed, and plowing on
towards our destination
with the viewer powerless
to stop it. But ‘Arkangel’
is unable to solely rely
on this tactic, as, for
this episode structure to
hold up, the plot must
not depend on the erratic
unreasonable reactions of
characters.
Some critics have
suggested that the episode
does not venture far
enough from the obvious
moral questions, noting
the missed opportunity for
the exploration of themes
other than helicopter par-
enting. While ‘Arkangel’
is certainly a fantastic
premise, backed by fan-
tastic young acting talent,
some may also find the
episode does not venture
far enough from the most
obvious ethical questions.
Despite this, ‘Arkangel’
stands out as one of only
two episodes this season
that feel anywhere near
to the Black Mirror of
seasons 1 and 2, ending
with that warm, familiar
sinking feeling that I
want from an hour of
TV. ‘Arkangel’ is merely
a turn back to quality we
saw in season 3, and not
a step forward. For Black
Mirror to remain relevant
(which it almost certainly
has ample opportunity to)
it must not settle for the
obvious questions and
more obvious answers.

USS CALLISTER
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
Black Mirror’s modus
operandi – showing us
how technological devel-
opments will only exac-
erbate the darkness that
lies below our thin veneer
of humanity – only works
when it straddles the right
side of plausibility. It’s a
difficult thing to get right,
as evidenced by ‘Croco-
dile’, which is by far the
worst episode of the new
series thanks to its refusal
to represent anything
coming remotely close to
actual human behaviour.
This time the technol-
ogy is a device that reads
your memories, the setting
is somewhere in Scan-
dinavia where everyone
has massive houses, and
the human instinct is…
a propensity to violently
murder people? Starring
Angela Riseborough as an
architect whose boyfriend
runs down a cyclist,
‘Crocodile’ explores the
classic idea that small
lies lead to big lies, but
progresses at too fast a
pace to allow us to believe
in its storyline. In a des-
peration to draw blood,
Brooker’s script has Rise-
borough’s character going
down a road away from
plausible humanity, and
the result is a schlocky,
campy episode. Even
its payoff at the end is
laughable, like something
out of The Scary Door.
Riseborough is excellent,
as are her co-stars Kiran
Sonia Sawar and Andrew
Gower, but they are
working with exception-
ally poor material. There’s
only so much they can
do with the badly set-up
premise.
I demand a full episode
centred around the real
star of the show: the
self-driving pizza delivery
van. The future is bright,
Mr Brooker. FF

HANG THE DJ
Director: Colm McCarthy.

BLACK MUSEUM
‘Hang the DJ’ is a
spiritual successor to
season 3’s ‘San Junipero’:
both episodes have the
same basic structure,
following a relationship
that blossoms in a setting
that is somehow ‘off’,
and both end with the
revelation that this setting
is just some sort of sim-
ulation. Unfortunately,
this is where the parallels
between the two end,
and ‘Hang the DJ’ falls
short of delivering the
same punch that made
‘San Junipero’ season 3’s
standout episode.
Where ‘San Junipero’
earned its merit was in the
slow, methodical reveal of
information that twisted
the viewers’ perceptions
of the reality presented
until the episode finally
‘clicks’. In ‘Hang the DJ’
we are lead down no such
track, with only scattered
comments by Frank on
his doubts about reality
and the tenuous fact that
pebbles seem to always
bounce four times to
indicate that something is
amiss. This is less a hint
and more of a reveal in
itself, as from this point
onwards the viewer is
just left to wait until the
episode is ready to reveal
that Frank and Amy are
just living in a simulation
– realistically, there is no
other possibility.
Where the episode
really falls short of the
standard expected is in
its final minutes, where
we learn that 998 out of
the 1000 Frank and Amy
simulations realised that
the dating game was just
a test. Not only does this
raise somewhat alarming
questions about what the
episode has to say about
modern dating (thatTinder
and its ilk have gamified
the dating process?), but
also does not seem to
provide any solid reason
for claiming that the pair
are a 99.8% match. Would
they have passed the test
if they had decided to
escape the simulation
alone? Earlier seasons of
Black Mirror have not
relied on chance character
decisions, at least on this
scale, and the dependence
on such this season shows
a decline in the quality to
be expected of the show
going forward. AM
Director: David Slade.
Script: Charlie Brooker.

METALHEAD
Director David Slade
might have put some
viewers off with his
decision to shoot ‘Metal-
head’ in black and white,
but the decision is bold,
and pays off. Centring
around a lone woman
(Maxine Peake) escaping
from a killer robot – re-
sembling a dog, but with
added weaponry – ‘Metal-
head’ is visually stunning,
from start to finish.
Overhead tracking shows
emphasise the thrilling
desolation of the country-
side, its dangerous beauty
offset by the vicious
robotics on display. We
frequently cut from these
wide open shots – high-
lighting the isolation of
Peake’s character – to
close-ups of her face,
creating a claustrophobic
atmosphere that contrib-
utes to the episode’s sense
of unease.
It is clear that Slade’s
intention with the episode
is to create an unremitting
tension within the viewer,
and he does this well,
putting us on the edge of
our seats. As part of the
Black Mirror universe,
however, something
seems missing. It resem-
bles a survival horror
– albeit a very good one
– which is a genre that
has been done to death
across TV, film, and video
games. And it lacks what
sets such horrors apart – a
gripping back story. We’re
dropped right into the
middle of a post-apoca-
lyptic world, with no sort
of explanation of how
things got to be that way.
This is, obviously, a delib-
erate choice, but then the
episode ends with a reveal
that tries to impose some
kind of narrative where
there wasn’t one before
– it leaves us wanting
more. There are enough
individual elements in
‘Metalhead’ to add up to
a stellar episode, but they
never quite come together
to a satisfying whole. FF
I saved the best until
last. I’d heard from
Twitter that this was one
of the best episodes of the
new season – comparable
to standouts from the
previous few – packed to
the brim with the juicy
darkness Black Mirror
is known for. And while
‘Black Museum’ did
deliver some of the chills
you get when an episode
is tapping into something
really deep, its structure
makes it difficult to appre-
ciate as a cohesive whole.
Yes, this is one of
those tropes well-loved
by writers, and usually
disparaged by viewers:
the compendium episode,
where we have multiple
individual stories instead
of a single one. In the
case of ‘Black Museum’,
the eponymous museum
plays host to a number
of gruesome artifacts and
exhibitions, of which we
are shows three, in short
twenty minute bursts. It
begins with its weakest
segment, in which a
medical device that allows
a doctor to feel what their
patient feels goes badly
wrong – not because of
any instinct of human
nature, but rather because
it simply malfunctions.
This is then followed by
two better parts, which –
despite some flaws – lead
up to a conclusion that is
genuinely surprising.
But no amount of shock
can disguise the fact that
this episode isn’t an ex-
ceptional idea stretched
to its logical conclusion,
but three reasonable ideas
tacked together, none of
which are explored fully.
It’s not an awe-inspiring
end to the season, but
it certainly remains one
of the highlights of the
lackluster set of episodes
on offer. FF
