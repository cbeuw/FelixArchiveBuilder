F
aith schools are
about to become
a major topic of
conversation in
UK politics. The new ed-
ucation secretary, Damian
Hinds, has committed to
remove the 50% cap on
the number of students
belonging to a certain
religious denomination
at a school. It is thought
that this would benefit
primarily Catholic
schools, due to elements
of Canon law that prevent
Catholic schools from
turning potential Catholic
students away. Therefore,
there have been no
further openings of any
other Catholic schools
in protest at this law. A
Department of Education
spokesman stated that the
reason the cap should be
scrapped is due to the fact
that Catholic and CofE
schools consistently per-
form at a higher level than
other schools. It is worth
pointing out that the same
cannot be said for Muslim
and some Jewish schools
of which there have been
new openings since the
50% cap was introduced
10 years ago…
In opposition to this
proposal are the previous
education secretary and
Ofsted, who have stated
that by allowing schools
to select 100% of their
intake by faith it will not
only deny parents access
to good local schools, but
will also lead to increasing
segregation that has been
nicknamed “education
apartheid.”
Personally,asanatheist,
I am totally opposed to
faith schools in general, as
I do not believe that faith
should play any part in the
running of a state. Faith,
in my opinion, should be a
deeply personal thing that
you do not project onto
others and therefore is not
present in the running of
schools or the selection
of pupils for schools. That
does not mean to say that
I rule out encountering
religion in a school
environment – in fact, I
positively encourage it –
but it should be taught in
such a way as to be totally
impartial and discuss the
social moral and ethical
implications of each
religion separately.
If I was being radical,
then a further proposition
I would make would be
to prevent children from
practicing religion until
they are old enough to
adequately understand
it. I believe that certain
variants of faith foster an
unhealthy and backward
view of the world that is
not productive in today’s
society. If Theresa May
is serious about ensuring
that British values are at
the core of the curriculum
then she will have to
address the fact that many
variants of faith today do
not embrace these values.
Therefore it seems coun-
terproductive on her’s
and the government’s
part to take this step,
but this probably stems
from a lack of clear ideas
on exactly what British
values are and what they
stand for, due to the
divisive nature of the idea
of British values.
I imagine instead that
the main reasons for
the push towards faith
schools is purely due to
the pushback on grammar
schools. Theresa May
wentintogovernmentwith
the grand plan to expand
grammar schools through-
out the nation, because
she believes that they
encourage social mobility
despite all evidence to the
contrary. However, the
implications of encour-
aging grammar schools
have solely resulted in a
large scale failure to better
provide social mobility or
higher quality education
for people in the area,
often resulting in extra
provision in areas that did
not require it, leaving the
state of chronic under-
provision in other areas
unresolved. It also did not
help that there was sig-
nificant stigma attached
to grammar schools from
when the decision was
made to abolish them,
which made the proposal
more unpopular.
I believe that the
motivation that Theresa
again May may not care
about social mobility, and
instead about catering for
the needs of Conservative
voters, who have pushed
for these selective schools
that are solely beneficial
to them.
It may also be the case
that this is being carried
out in order to appease
certain more conservative
members of her party, such
as Jacob Rees-Mogg, who
has spoken out against the
50% limit. In light of the
current difficulties with
Brexit, it may be seen as
a sop to those members of
her party dissatisfied with
the current negotiations,
appeasing them with more
safely right wing policies.
The idea of education
as the battleground makes
sense from an election
point of view, as it will
strengthen May’s appeal
to her Conservative base
and those most affected
by it will be least likely
to vote. It also allows
for the creation of a qua-
si-grammar school system
without the massive
opposition, as there is
significantly less oppo-
sition to faith schools,
which are accepted as a
key element in the British
landscape. The opposition
is likely to come from less
popular people such as in-
tellectuals, humanists, and
atheists such as myself,
and with everyone con-
centrating on Brexit and
an ineffectual opposition
it is likely that this policy
will go through relatively
unchallenged.
It is only by resisting
policies such as this that
social mobility can be
achieved. Otherwise
this is the perfect crime
against the children of the
future.

“The push
towards faith
schools is
due to the
pushback
against
grammar
schools”
May has for pioneering
faith schools is under the
mistaken belief that they
will benefit pupils by
providing a higher quality
of education without
acknowledging the role
a highly selective intake
plays in ensuring how
good a school is, similar
to the way a grammar
school works. When she
makes this assumption
that a better quality of
school would provide
a significant amount of
social mobility fails to
factor in that the majority
of Catholic parents are
likely to have significant
social advantages and
thereby the cause of
social mobility would
not be advanced. Then
