New mathematics partnership gives hope to
post-Brexit research
NEWS
Imperial is opening
a maths lab in
partnership with
a French research
agency, offering some
hope to post-Brexit
academic funding

I
mperial has part-
nered with a French
research agency to
open a maths lab,
which will promote col-
laboration between the
UK and France as Brit-
ain enters a post-Brexit
world.
The International Joint
Research Unit (UMI
– unité mixte internation-
ale) is the first research
collaboration between the
UK and France’s National
Centre for Scientific
Research (CNRS) – Eu-
rope’s largest fundamental
science organisation. The
UMI will have equal status
to a CNRS lab, meaning
academics will have the
same funding and resourc-
es as their continental
counterparts. The focus of
their work will be on areas
including number theory,
mathematical analysis,
biomathematics, and fi-
nancial mathematics.
The UMI will be
headed by Imperial’s
Professor Richard Craster.
Speaking to Radio 4’s
Today programme, Pro-
fessor Craster said: “The
new partnership serves as
proof that these times of
uncertainty need not be
times of stagnation.”
Professor Craster was
not the only person to
make an oblique reference
to Brexit when comment-
ing on the UMI Abraham
deMoivre(namedafterthe
French mathematician).
The French ambassador
to the UK, Jean-Pierre
Jouyet, described the UMI
