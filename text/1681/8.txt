Why Macedonia is relevant again
Grumpy Bastard turns his sights to the history of Macedonia. Yes, you heard right: Macedonia.
Don’t ask, just enjoy it.

acedonia as a
country has
a very proud
and ancient
history. Originally the
home of the Mycenaean
Greeks, after their demise,
Philip of Macedon arose
to kick the shit out of
Athens and Sparta and
then bequeathed his army
to his son. Better known
as Alexander the Great, he
was then able to beat the
living hell out of Darius
of Persia. This was unfor-
tunately over 2000 years
ago, and Macedonia has
quietly sat on the sidelines
of history ever since.
Now, of course, the time
for Macedonia to make
its triumphant return has
arrived!
The reason for this
return to glory is simple.
Yes, Greece is now united
and the sarissa is no
longer a revolutionary
invention capable of
winning battles against
any equivalent power. It
is no longer the time for
a group of noble com-
panions to gallop across
the plains of the Middle
East and trample all in
their path. For a country
that isn’t allowed to use
residents of the former
Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia – have discov-
ered a revolutionary new
weapon and a new people
to conquer. The weapon is
of course fake news and
the victims are gullible
members of democracy’s
everywhere.
Yes, the Macedonians
are now the world famous
purveyors of articles
designed to fool readers
into believing a different
reality that more closely
conforms to their beliefs.
Forget Black Mirror’s
crazy technology and
Kremlin stooges attempt-
ing to hack the American
election, in today’s day
and age it is important to
remember where the true
power in the world lies:
with Goran the fake news
editor in the small city of
Veles. Want someone to
believe in a paedophile
ring centred around a
pizza restaurant? Goran’s
your man! As long as
you’re prepared to pay
good money, teenagers
with an internet connec-
tion will happily write a
reality that more closely
resembles your beliefs
that you can share with
your easily manipulated
and gullible friends and
family.
It really is remarkable
that a people trodden
down so far after genera-
tions of a communist dic-
tator’s rule have bounced
back to truly understand
what democracy is really
all about: lying, but lying
convincingly.
The thing I am possibly
most impressed by is
the fact that they really
get what people want to
believe down to a tee. I
mean there are some great
satirical news sites such as
Southend News Network
(Milos Yiannopoulos’
favourite) but I don’t feel
they reach a wide enough
audience to qualify as
A true symbol of power in the modern world //wikimedia
truly influential. Mace-
donia though, managed
to make amazing things
happen, such as getting
people to believe that
Donald Trump would
make a good president or
that banning people from
Islamic countries would
have a significant impact
on terrorism. What a
nation!
Glorious, relevant
Macedonia!
“Fake news
means true
power now lies
with Goran,
the fake news
editor in the
city of Veles”
just Macedonia due to an
ongoing dispute with the
dead economic power of
Greece, the Macedonians
