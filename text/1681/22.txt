Summer Ball 2018
Summer Ball is one of the biggest events on the student calendar. With
only 1,700 people able to attend, it’s no wonder tickets have been selling
like hot cakes! Don’t miss out, as the best priced tickets have already
been gobbled up by those quick on the draw.
This end of year celebration, held on South Kensington Campus, features
a free fun fair, fireworks display, great value food and drink, and amazing
performances including a headliner.Thanks to a student vote, this year’s
event theme is Roaring 20s.

Great teachers make a difference! We know this because none of us
would have got this far without them. So why not show your appreciation
with a SACAs nomination? There are 8 categories and students can
submit as many nominations as they like. There’s also a category for
best support staff because, let’s face it, they’re the unsung heroes of
our academic experience. So let’s show that performance matters by
rewarding excellence in academic and support staff. Every nominee gets
a coveted mug and winners are announced in May.
Nominations close 11 February. Submit yours now at
