E
verybody has one
of those nights
where you stare
at the ceiling in
the dark, thinking about
the books that you have to
return by Friday, the pres-
ent that you have to get
grandpa for his birthday
next week… the list goes
on and on – and you just
cannot sleep!
If you can relate, this
article may hold the
solution.
Insomnia is a common
problem in the modern
world. Whilst mental
health issues or light
exposure from our phones
may impact how fast
we can fall asleep, one
common cause of poor
sleep is the worry posed
by upcoming tasks in the
future.
These unfinished tasks
are shown to have a high
level of cognitive activa-
tion, such that thoughts
can pop up automatically
at various times during the
day.
To combat this phe-
nomenon, it was shown
that bedtime writing may
help you to fall asleep
faster. In cognitive behav-
ioural therapy (CBT) for
insomnia, therapists will
often ask patients to write
a ‘worry list’ to unburden
anxieties. However, it
was unclear what exactly
you should write about in
order to help you sleep.
To answer that
question, scientists from
Baylor University in
Texas recruited 57 healthy
volunteers for a one-week
sleep study. Half of the
group were asked to write
down a list of tasks they
had completed in the past
few days, while the other
half were asked to scribe
a to-do list for errands that
they have to run in the
next few days.
Both writing activities
required five minutes
before bed, and the time
needed to fall asleep was
measured using overnight
polysomnography – a
machine that measures
brain activity.
Surprisingly, though
many would suspect
writing a to-do list prior
to sleeping would cause
more worry, as you would
be reminded of all the
things you need to do
in the coming week, the
reverse is true! Partici-
pants who wrote down a
to-do list fell asleep faster
“Unfinished
tasks are
shown to have
a high level
of cognitive
activation,
such that
thoughts
pop up
automatically”
“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-
quote. We love
these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
than those who made a
‘have-done’ list.
The explanation behind
this effect is still debata-
ble. The most compelling
hypothesis suggests this
activity allows you to
offload worries, therefore
reducing the amount
of time needed to fall
asleep. Completed tasks
in the past are not worri-
some, hence do not need
‘off-loading’, so writing a
list has no impact.
The quantity of writing
is also important, as vol-
unteers who completed a
longer to-do list fell asleep
faster than those who had
a shorter to-do list. Con-
trarily, people who wrote
a detailed account of their
past activities needed
more time to fall asleep.
This can be explained
by various reasons.
One explanation is that
busier people may have
a longer completed-task
list, and may find it more
difficult to sleep as they
have higher stress level.
A second explanation
suggests that thinking of
past events can lead to the
activation of thought pro-
cesses for future events.
For instance, if you think
of the PowerPoint you
made yesterday, it may
prompt you to think about
the presentation for next
week, therefore triggering
more worries.
Though this potentially
opens a new door to a free
and easily administered
sleep, larger studies
are needed to conclude
whether this could help
people with insomnia
or mental health issues.
Nevertheless, next time
you are unable to fall
asleep, rather than writing
your diary, get a pen and
start writing a to-do list
instead!
