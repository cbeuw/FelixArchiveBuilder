ICSWP Men’s Water polo narrowly defeated in dying
seconds
T
ides are turning
forICSWPmen’s
water polo.
Last Saturday
Imperial faced a strong
University of West
England (UWE) side.
With Imperial and UWE
at opposite ends of the
league table, and Imperial
missing several key
players, UWE were firm
favourites coming into
the fixture, but Imperial
came with an unflappable
attitude.
Both sides began
cautiously, with neither
side wanting to give away
easy goals and the focus
very much on defence.
The first quarter ended
with UWE edging the
match slightly, winning
3-2. As the second quarter
progressed, Imperial’s
fears before the game
were becoming a reality
with UWE scoring several
goalswithoutanyresponse
from Imperial. UWE’s
tactics were getting the
better of Imperial, with
chance after chance being
created and being wasted
with bad shots and worse
decisions (editor’s note:
like a night in Metric). By
half time Imperial were
lucky to only be losing 7-3
after some excellent saves
by the stand-in goalkeeper
David Moores.
With the third quarter
beginning, it was clear
Imperial were not willing
to give up and would fight
togetthemselvesbackinto
the game. This was led by
captain Sam Hanrahan
and vice-captain Ramon
Fernandez-Mir scoring
four goals between them
in quick succession. There
were some emotional
celebrations from Ramon,
and he dedicated his goals
to Christina Duckworth.
As the final quarter
began the situation looked
bleak for Imperial with
the score very much in
UWE’s favour and centre
back Gian Ameri majored
out, no longer being able
to take part in the game.
an Irish citizen only hours
before the game, began
the comeback scoring
and bringing Imperial
closer to UWE. This
was continued when Leo
Pashov, on his return from
injury, scored. Imperial
continued to push and
with just 15 seconds left
on the clock Alberto Lauri
scored bringing us level.
The fans went wild, this
had to be it, Imperials first
points of the season.
Imperial went to press
hard and allow no passes
to be made as UWE had
one last attack. They
launched the ball up to
their centre forward and
with the rest of the team
watching on in despair,
he scored the winning
goal with just 5 seconds
left. What had looked to
be one of sport’s greatest
ever comebacks faltered,
failed, and UWE won.
Despite the immediate
deflation of such a loss,
this was the best perfor-
mance of the season for
the team and it is important
that the positives are taken
from the game. Imperial
will travel to Bristol on
Saturday to face UWE
again, they will bring the
same steely-eyed determi-
nation to get the first W of
the season.

With only two minutes
left to play UWE scored
to go three goals into the
lead, making any possibil-
ity of Imperial achieving a
result seem near to impos-
sible. However, Imperial
had other ideas, once
again showing their de-
termination to get a result.
