Innovation will save us from an economic
death
We can return to long-term economic prosperity if we take a few lessons from the laws of
thermodynamics.

T
he global econ-
omy is stalling
because of a lack
of innovation.
Beyond computers, there
is no longer a revolution-
ary mentality towards
technology. You can see
it in our psychology: we
call ourselves the devel-
oped world, as if all great
strides have already been
made. Granted we depict
our visions of the future
in Hollywood movies, but
– beyond improved CGI
– these visions largely
haven’t changed.
If you look beyond
the Internet and beyond
superficial design, we
have done little more than
incrementally improve
in recent decades. Aer-
oplanes are still largely
recognisable from their
1960s blueprints, and
while energy has flirted
with both nuclear and
renewables it remains
dominated by fossil fuels.
This is because well-es-
tablished sectors are typ-
ically concentrated with a
few large companies.
These behemoths,
despite what their recruit-
ment marketing may tell
you, prefer incremental
improvements rather than
industry-destabilising
innovations. These com-
panies are risk-averse
– they have shareholders
to please and investing
in innovation carries risk,
particularly in abstract
and uncertain areas.
Economics borrows its
mathematical foundations
from thermodynamics and
so a simple thermodynam-
ic analogy should serve to
illustrate how this lack of
innovation is leading to
staleness:
whereas cold companies
are lagging. Heat transfer
occurs as the colder
company imitates away
all the hotter company’s
technological break-
throughs until we reach
equilibrium.
The end state in ther-
modynamics is called the
heat death of the universe,
when the whole universe
is at the same temperature
and there is no free energy
to be exploited. Similarly,
under this analogy, an
economic heat death
would be a state of perfect
competition, a market
made up of undifferen-
tiated companies with
undifferentiated products
competing on price.
Profits in a perfectly
competitive market are
minimal: airlines on
average made a profit
of $0.37 per $178 ticket
in 2012. With such low
profits, there is little
money to reinvest into
the company. Funding
gets cut for research and
development projects,
while improvements to
services and facilities
start getting cut too. To
make higher profits and
avoid economic sterility,
you must dominate an
industry.
There are two ways
to dominate a market
through innovation. The
first is a Google: produce
a product magnitudes
better than your rivals
as Google did with their
search engine. The second
is an Amazon: create an
entirely new market, as
Amazon did with online
retail. What both have in
common is disruption;
while not essential, it is
perhaps a reason why
innovation has been
limited to internet-based
start-ups. Once on top
though and in a dominant
position, it becomes even
more important to keep
on innovating, otherwise
all your advances will be
imitated away.
Industries such as
management consulting
and investment banking
offer great value in well-
oiled economies but they
rely on technological
breakthroughs for their
survival. In the absence
of advances, they are
merely catalysts to this
state of equilibrium, this
economic heat death.
Consultancies often work
to restructure a company,
streamlining it to reduce
costs, make savings, and
unlock profits. There is
however a finite limit to
this process and gains
economic struggle to
focus on short-term
livelihoods by securing
positions in these or other
long-established indus-
tries, it does not guarantee
long-term prosperity. For
that we need innovators,
creators and entrepre-
neurs, people with a revo-
lutionary mentality, those
that see the future as being
created, not imagined.
This is certainly a riskier
pathway as you must
forge it on your own –
recreating what someone
else has already done will
earn you nothing. With
risk, however, comes
reward and those that are
successful are often more
handsomely rewarded for
their boldness.
Today’s face of inno-
vation is arguably Elon
Musk: his companies
include Tesla, SpaceX,
SolarCity, The Boring
Company, Neuralink,
Hyperloop, and more.
Though his cult follow-
ing may present him as
divinely blessed, the
success of these compa-
nies is instead enabled by
thousands of innovators.
If there is something to be
learnt from Elon Musk, it
is that his vast number of
projects are evidence that
opportunities to innovate
still exist.
If we are to reinject
dynamism into our
economy, then we need
to be bold and start taking
risks in our career choices.
At Imperial we have great
scientific foundations and
exposure to cutting-edge
technology, putting us in
prime position to be the
innovators and the entre-
preneurs of the future. So,
let’s be bold and let’s be
ambitious!
The economy needs to be driven by innovators // Creative Commons
“For long-term
prosperity
we need
innovators,
creators, and
entrepeneurs
– people with a
revolutionary
mentality”
become increasingly
marginal without techno-
logical innovation.
Investment bankers
make money off bets, pre-
dicting when a company
is under- or over-valued.
In this eventual state of
perfect competition, all
companies are undiffer-
entiated and correctly
valued, meaning there
is no more money to be
made. To start unlocking
money again, there needs
to be technological break-
throughs that destabilise
an industry.
Though it may be
tempting in times of
“Beyond
computers,
there is no
longer a
revolutionary
mentality
towards
technology”
In thermodynamics,
where you have temper-
ature differences, heat
will flow from the hotter
object to the colder object
until they reach equilib-
rium. To apply this to
economics, we can simply
refer to technology differ-
ences; hot companies are
technologically-advanced
