I
t’s January. The
Christmas holidays
are over, which
means that winter has
lost its magical charm and
is now just cold and dark.
But fear not, for there is
a solution to your woes:
chocolate.
As Imperial is heavy on
the science, I’m sure many
of us know that chocolate
is a natural mood booster,
thanks to chemicals such
as phenylethylamine – the
‘love drug’ – and anad-
amide – which activates
dopamine production.
But that’s enough about
the chemical effects;
chocolate still needs to
taste good for it to really
lift those winter blues. So
where better to start than
the hyped Dark Sugars.
Naturally, as a highly
trendy chocolatier, Dark
Sugars is located in
First impressions
Before even entering
The Cocoa House the
luscious chocolate aroma
took over me, and I felt
myself entering a choco-
late haze. The shop has a
very earthy vibe, with an
overwhelming number of
chocolates on display in
wooden bowls in every
corner. The chocolates
looked irresistible, but I
was here for the famously
hyped hot chocolate. So
I pulled myself away
from the gorgeous coffee
truffles I had spotted, and
went to the hot chocolate
bar.
The hot chocolates
The board above the
counter listed a number
of different flavours of hot
chocolate such as ginger,
nutmeg, salted caramel,
and cardamom. I decided
to go for something a
bit different so I ordered
cardamom. The drinks
are made right in front of
you: firstly the spices are
added to the light milky
hot chocolate and then
they cut up the huge slabs
of chocolate (white, milk,
or dark) on the counter
into thin shards to make
the decadent topping. My
cup was quite literally
overflowing with choco-

Worth the Hype?
Dark Sugars is every chocolate lover’s dream – the
aroma of the place alone was enough for me to fall in
love. The care that was put into making this chocolat-
ier something special really shows, from the beautiful
wooden décor to the amazing flavours of chocolates.
The hot chocolate really was incredible and although
it is on the pricier side I still believe it is worth the
hype.

Nyanga, opened the choc-
olate shop following three
years of researching cocoa
on her family’s farm in
Ghana, a real commit-
ment to understanding her
product. In 2015, Dark
Sugars: The Cocoa House
opened, offering rich hot
chocolates and an immer-
sive experience where
cocoa beans are roasted

melting of the chocolate
begins; making an orig-

choc into a rich luxurious
chocolate experience. The
cardamom gave it a nice
flavour as well, but really
those chocolate shavings
alone were incredible.
A perfect treat on a cold
January day!
