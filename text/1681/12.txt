017 saw a lot of big
album releases and
a lot of comebacks.
Probably the most
anticipated return (at least
for me) was Gorillaz.
Expectations were huge,
and the hype-building
skills of the Gorillaz team
were proven to be beyond
compare.
The anticipation had
already begun to accumu-
late back in 2016 when
Jamie Hewlett and Damon
Albarn let slip in inter-
views that a new Gorillaz
album was in the works
and would, in fact, be out
soon. Their famed avatars
(2D, Murdoc, Russel,
and Noodle) started
appearing in the media,
and updates on their lives
were slowly unveiled,
bridging the gap between
phase 3 and the incoming
phase 4. Everyone was
getting ready for the big
comeback. However,
2016 soon came to an
end leaving the impatient
fans with no new music
from the world’s favourite
virtual band. It was exactly
one year ago – January
19th, the day before
Donald Trump’s inaugu-
ration - when we finally
heard the first Gorillaz
song since 2012, ‘Halle-
lujah Money’, featuring
one of the most promising
and original new artists
around – Benjamin Clem-
entine. Murdoc and his
crew started creeping into
the collective conscious-
ness, using all possible
platforms of expression.
From posts on social
media, interviews, Spotify
playlists through videos
and smartphone app to
murals, posters and secret
gigs. They had everything
covered.
As always, the team
behind Gorillaz pushed
technological limits to
bring their ideas to life.
This time around, apart
from cool animations and
even a 360° video, they
also created a portable,
eco-friendly recording
studio and produced
an augmented reality
app The Lenz which
showed Gorillaz-related
content whenever you
pointed your smartphone
camera at something
magenta. What’s more,
2D and Murdoc even
gave their first ever real
time animated interview,
blurring the boundaries
reality and fiction. In the
world where avatars are
given so much importance
and cartoon characters
are not only present
in the show business,
but become influential
“They’re a
brand, an
industry, a
one of a kind
popcultural
phenomenon.” “We’ve heard
slogans
about coming
together and
sharing one
love a million
times by now,
but when
Gorillaz say
it, I actually
believe them”
politicians – Noodle, 2D,
Murdoc and Russel seem
more real and relevant
than ever before.
Gorillaz have always
been more than just
music – they’re a brand,
an industry, a one of a
kind popcultural phe-
nomenon. But let’s talk
about the album itself.
On the 28 April 2017, the
wait was finally over and
HUMANZ dropped. While
some fans immediately
loved it, others were a bit
disappointed (see Felix
issue 1678). I would not
call it a masterpiece; there
were a couple of songs
that didn’t quite match
the standard of hits like
‘Clint Eastwood’or ‘Dirty
Harry’.Nonetheless,
there were many great
tracks (e.g. ‘Strobelite’ or
‘Charger’) and the album
overall was received well.
Accusations of having too
many guests on the record
and not enough Damon
made by some fans are
rather pointless. Gorillaz
has always been a collab-
orative effort and the mu-
sicians involved changed
over the years. Collabo-
ration lies at the heart of
HUMANZ. The title says
it all – HUMANZ is about
the humanity crisis we’re
going through. And it’s
not just represented in the
lyrics; the album carries
the message non-verbally.
Juxtaposition of individu-
al human voices and rich,
warm sounds of gospel
choirs, with machine gen-
erated music resulting in
a good quality, cohesive
album is itself a metaphor
of a human race that can
find its place in the arti-
ficial world and work as
one.
Despite dealing with
tough issues, HUMANZ
ends with a positive
message.You may say that
finishing the record with
words “We got the power
to be loving each other no
matter what happens” is
rather infantile. I agree.
We’ve heard slogans
about coming together
and sharing one love a
million times by now.
But when Gorillaz say it,
I actually believe them,
because they support their
statements with action.
It is the most apparent in
their live performances.
Seeing this diverse group
of people coming from
various musical back-
grounds, young and old,
black and white, famous
and unknown, rappers
and singers putting on a
fantastic show at the O2
Arena on 5th December
2017 was truly uplifting.
The gig was wonder-
ful. The band, smiling
at each other, dancing,
spontaneously hugging
and simply having lots of
fun on stage, proved that
the coexistence is possible
and even enjoyable! The
long setlist included old
hits (‘Feel Good Inc.’),
new bangers (‘Androm-
eda’), great renditions of
slightly forgotten tracks
(‘Every planet we reach
is dead’) and homages to
iconic artists who are no
longer with us (‘Stylo’).
With two drumkits, all
sorts of electronics and a
multitude of other musi-
cians on stage, the sounds
were extremely powerful
and kept the crowd going
for over two hours.
The show culminat-
ed with the beautiful
‘Demon Days’ from their
2007 classic, leaving
the audience with a big
red sphere on the screen
and the choir repeatedly
chanting “To the Sun!”.
The song is still relevant
after a decade. It gives
hope and acknowledges
that to cope with hard
times, it is important (but
difficult) to stay optimis-
tic: “In these demon days
it’s so cold inside / So hard
for a good soul to survive/
(…) Pick yourself up
it’s a brand new day /
so turn yourself round /
Don’t burn yourself, turn
yourself / Turn yourself
around into the Sun”.
With that in mind we
can enter 2018 hoping
for some good changes in
our lives and in the world
around us. But above all
waiting for the rumoured
next Gorillaz album!
It’s the moments we relive, it’s the moments like this // Sabina Nowakowska
