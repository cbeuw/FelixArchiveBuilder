How we can make a difference
W
e start this
week off
with a bit of
good news:
the opening of a maths
lab at Imperial, which is
a collaboration between
French and UK research
groups. The International
Joint Research Unit will
have equal status with its
French counterpart, mean-
ing that the academics
working there will have
the same access to fund-
ing as their counterparts
across the Channel. It’s
a little piece of stability,
amid the floating sea of
awful uncertainty that is
Brexit. Three cheers for
collaboration!
Elsewhere, however,
things aren’t looking so
bright. This March, it will
havebeenthreeyearssince
the ‘misogyny at Varsity’
incident. For those of you
who weren’t here when it
happened – or were, but
don’t follow sports (don’t
blame you) – IC Women’s
Rugby were scheduled to
close out the 2015 Varsity
with the headline match.
It was meant to be a
triumphant celebration of
women in sport, shaking
things up, and making
change. Things didn’t go
to plan, however – the
coaches left early, the
food left out for the team
was cold and half-eaten,
and Imperial staff were
overheard making derog-
atory comments about the
players. All in all a bit of a
shitshow really.
In response, to this
incident and others, the
College commissioned an
investigation to look into
the institutional culture of
Imperial. It concluded that
there were problems with
harassment and bullying,
people didn’t know where
to go for help, and one
participant spoke of a
culture of misogyny that
was so deep as to be in-
grained within Imperial’s
very structures. It made
for depressing reading.
Of course, the College
said that lessons should
and would be learned
from the report. But that
was then, and this is now.
Has anything changed
in the three years since,
really? Since coming into
this role, I’ve come into
contact with a vast array
of people – way more
than I had previously in
my self-imposed exile to
medic-land – and the same
topics keep cropping up.
I hear stories of
students who have been
made to feel uncomfort-
able at constituent union
dinners, after being forced
to recount their sexual
experiences, eventually
just leaving early; I’ve
spoken to people whose
lecturers have told them
that women “find science
harder”, and crack jokes
about them being carried
along by the men in their
group; and I speak to
sports players who feel
that women’s clubs don't
get the attention they need
to develop or blossom. It
happens too often for this
to just be a few chance in-
cidents – something needs
to be done.
Over the next few
weeks, Felix will be
carrying out a project
looking at misogyny
at Imperial. If you’re
interested in making a dif-
ference, please complete
our online survey – it only
takes five minutes, and
while we can’t promise
an Amazon voucher or
anything like that, you
do get the satisfaction of
feeling that you’ve made
a difference, and contrib-
uted to something that has
the potential to see how
we can make Imperial a
university for all: http://

UMI was marked by a
symposium entitled New
Frontiers in Mathematics.
Speakers included Fields
Medal winners Professor
Cedric Villani (“the Lady
Gaga of mathematics”)
and Imperial’s Professor
Martin Hairer.
More than 2,700
collaborations between
Imperial and CNRS
researchers have been
published in the past five
years.

The National Student
Survey, which was
boycotted by several
other student
unions last year, has
opened for final year
undergraduates.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
S
tudents have
this week been
invited to take
part in the annual
National Student Survey
(NSS), through which
they can give feedback
about their course.
The survey, which is
open to all final year un-
dergraduates, opened on
the 8th January, and will
run until the end of April.
Last year’s NSS saw a
successful boycott by a
number of UK universi-
ties, who cited concerns
about links to increasing
tuition fees.
Last year’s NSS results
showed a wide range
as “a great milestone” and
emphasised the impor-
tance of immigration in
connecting researchers
and students.
“Mobility is fundamen-
tal in science, particularly
in mathematics,” he said,
adding: “Freedom of
movement is an essential
driving force.”
Imperial’s President
Professor Alice Gast
New maths unit highlights "importance of
international collaboration"
echoed Jouyet’s remarks,
saying: “UMI Abraham
de Moivre is a testament
to the importance of inter-
national collaboration and
it is a mark of the friend-
ship between France and
Britain. We take special
pride in the fact that this is
the first UMI in the United
Kingdom.”
Professor Gast has
previously highlighted the
need for “good immigra-
tion policies that enable
us to bring in talented
people” post-Brexit.
Since the Brexit vote
in 2016, some Imperial
staff have returned to their
home countries in the EU.
Staff still remaining at the
College have taken ad-
vantage of presentations
and one-to-one advice
sessions regarding legal
support.
Last year, Professor
Gast told French news-
paper Le Monde: “We
intend to remain the most
international institution.
We do not want border
controls to jeopardise
this situation. If there
are border controls, we
will commit to always
collaborating with people
of talent.”
EU citizens make up
one quarter of Imperial’s
staff and one fifth of its
student body. In October
2016, Professor Gast
announced an annual
£100,000 fund to “develop
collaborations in Europe
which lead to new science
and to applications for
external funding.”

Physics, Chemistry, and
Aerospace Engineering
coming under heavy fire.
Overall Imperial placed
74th in terms of satisfac-
tion, placing it level with
Cardiff and Hull. Imperial
received particularly poor
response for feedback
and assessment – overall,
fewer than half of physics
students surveyed felt
marking was fair or feed-
back timely.
President (Education),
asked final year students
to complete the survey
online. They said the NSS
gives students “a chance
to leave a lasting impact
on Imperial” after they left
the university, and their
responses would “help the
College see both where it
is excelling but also where
it can improve”.
The NSS last year was
marked by a boycott,
which saw twelve
universities omitted after
they failed to reach a 50%
participation rate – the
minimum requirement
for inclusion. Universities
omitted included UCL,
Oxford, and Cambridge,
with UCL seeing a 30%
year-on-year drop in par-
ticipation. Imperial’s final
participation rate was
74%, which Buitendijk
and Burstow described as
“a figure we hope to beat
this year”.
The boycott was
organised in response to
concerns that NSS scores
would be linked to the
Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF), an
awards scheme that would
have allowed universities
to raise their tuition fees
in line with inflation.
In October, however,
Theresa May announced
plans to freeze tuition fees
at a maximum of £9,250
until 2019.
The NSS is sent out
every year to all final
year undergraduates at
UK higher education
institutions. It asks 27
questions across a number
of domains, such as “As-
sessment and Feedback”.
It is commissioned by the
Higher Education Funding
Council for England
(HEFCE), and undertaken
by Ipsos MORI.
