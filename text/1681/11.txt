F
or almost a
decade, research-
ers have been
investigating the
possibility of using stem
cells to form organoids:
t h r e e - d i m e n s i o n a l ,
multicellular assemblies
that mimic the structure
and function of organs.
Organoid models have
now been established
for multiple organs,
including the brain, liver,
and kidney, using adult
or pluripotent stem cells.
More primitive tissues,
for example the optic-cup,
have also been established
as organoids, opening up
new avenues for the study
of eye formation.
Developmental biol-
ogist Yoshiki Sasai and
his group established this
optic-cup organoid from a
three-dimensional culture
of mouse embryonic
stem cell aggregates. This
stem-cell derived retinal
epithelium was observed
to spontaneously form
epithelial vesicles, the
flexible distal portion of
which folded inward to
form a shape resonant
with the embryonic optic
cup. It is an excellent
example of how organoid
development often
strongly resembles natural
embryonic development
in vivo, giving researchers
the opportunity to study
developmental processes
and organogenesis (the
development of organs).
Some methods for gen-
erating organoids from
embryonic stem cells
involve providing cells
with minimum differen-
tiation information and
enabling them to self-or-
ganise. Other methods
provide stem cells with
signalling that is known
to result in the differen-
tiation into specific cells
types. Regardless of the
method employed, the
resulting organoids can
be used to increase our
understanding of human
processes and develop-
ment, including disease.
Organoids are especially
useful for the study of
genetic disorders that
exert their malignancy
in utero, and do not have
accurate animal models.
Cerebral organoids were
recently used to model
aspects of lissencephaly,
a brain disorder in which
the brain itself does not
exhibit the usual folds
seen in the cerebral cortex.
This research identified
a mitotic defect in glia,
a cell type important in
human cortical develop-
ment.
While being an
incredibly useful tool,
organoids are far from
the perfect models for
study. A significant issue
that arises from the use
of in vitro organoids is
the lack of a vasculature
to sustain growth and
development of organoids
past foetal stages. It is not
yet possible to introduce
functional blood vessels
into petri dish organoids,
and current research is
only able to link organoids
to a circulatory system by
transplanting them into
live animals. Perhaps in
the future, more complex
in vitro organoids will
arise, with researchers
eventually being able to
grow entire human organs.
T
he applications of
robots span many
disciplines – far
beyond what
one might see on BBC’s
Robot Wars. Robots
themselves have long had
several applications in the
medical field, but only
recently have research-
ers demonstrated the
effectiveness of their use
for tissue regeneration.
At Boston’s Children’s
Hospital, researchers con-
ducted a proof-of-concept
study using a tissue-re-
generating robot on the
oesophagi of five pigs.
The robot consists of two
motorised rings and an
external control unit; as
it is only attached to the
oesophagus, it does not
affect other organs. The
motorised attachments, in
the form of rings sutured
to both ends of the oesoph-
agus, place traction forces
on the tube via a control
unit external to the body.
The magnitude of traction
forces can be adjusted
using this programmable
control unit, and the robot
pulls the oesophagus in
both directions either with
more or less force. A skin-
like barrier surrounds the
device to protect the mo-
torised unit from various
bodily fluids. It is widely
known that mechanical
forces and mechanotrans-
duction in cells play an
important role in tissue
growth, and this robot
looks to take advantage of
that knowledge.
During this study,
researchers increased the
ring separation distance
by 2.5mm each day, in all
five pigs for either eight or
nine days. This separation
strained the oesophagus,
and therefore induced me-
chanical forces. After the
2.5mm separation each
day, the mechanical forces
on the oesophagi were
measured. Following ring
separation, these forces
immediately increased
proportionally to the
separation distance, and
exponentially decayed in
the day following sepa-
ration, indicating tissue
proliferation. The oe-
sophagi lengthened with
increasing ring separation
distance, as the circumfer-
ence and thickness of the
muscular layer surround-
ing the oesophagi were
maintained, showing that
lengthening, as opposed
to stretching, was indeed
occurring. On average,
the pig oesophagi length-
ened by 77%. This result
is ground-breaking, as
the right amount of force
needed to be applied to
tissue to promote growth
is as of yet unknown.
In vivo tissue engineer-
ing is typically done using
cell-seeded scaffolds,
which induce cell prolif-
eration, but may fail due
to lag-time of vascularisa-
tion or the hosts immune
response. Robotic
implants for tissue re-
generation mitigate these
challenges. Due to this
novel tissue-generating
robot, oesophageal atresia
and short bowel syndrome
– two conditions that
are usually birth defects
which cause years of
discomfort – may have
found their cure. This
novel application is a
potential replacement
for otherwise invasive,
risky surgeries with long
recovery periods. The
team plans to next test the
device on large animal
models before moving
on to clinical trials in the
future.
