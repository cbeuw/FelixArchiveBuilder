t’s January again,
and to offset the
misery of the darkest
mornings of the year
Imperial’s Cross Country
and Athletics Club once
again had cunningly
planned a weekend
escape from the bustling
capital to somewhere
slightly quieter. Last
year saw a minibus-load
make the trek up North
to Newcastle; this time it
was decided to head down
South.
The destination was
set for Dorchester, the
historic county town of
Dorset and home to the
club’s notorious secre-
tary – writer of numerous
Felix articles detailing the
club’s exploits (including
this one).
The journey should
have been a breeze
relative to 2017’s winter
trip to Tyneside, with
an ETA of 21:00 after a
relaxed leaving time of
18:00. However, nothing
is ever that simple.
With the crew all
aboard one of the Union’s
relatively new, majestic
Peugeot Boxers, our
diligent drivers were com-
pleting their final safety
checks when they realised
that both brake lights were
not working, and we could
not get authorisation for
another bus as the relevant
authorities had gone home
for the weekend.
This set in motion a
series of (failed) attempts
to remedy the problem
before the drivers eventu-
ally resorted to calling the
RAC (other breakdown
companies are available),
who fixed the problem in
a matter of minutes after
a two-hour wait. All this
meant a departure time
of 22:30 and the resulting
clear roads meant the
brakes were hardly needed
for the two-hour journey
down to the South Coast.
The problematic start
to the tour did not dampen
spirits, however, and
the runners arose from
their makeshift beds in
‘the orangery’ early on
Saturday morning for
the short drive to the
“The crowd

nearby five km parkrun
in the seaside resort of
Weymouth (known to
local alcohol-fuelled
teenagers as Wey-biza).
The team posted a strong
performance and the usual

rather chilly (freezing)
waters for a “refreshing”
dip.
Sensibly heading
briskly back to the
warmth of the minibus
to avoid hypothermia,
the squad headed back
to base and proceeded to
have a mighty brunch and
yoga session (albeit not
simultaneously), before
settling down to watch
one of the club’s stars race
on BBC One! Imperial’s
Chris Olley managed to
battle home in 15th
place
in the Senior Men’s In-
ternational Challenge XC
in Edinburgh beating last
year’s BUCS XC winner
on the line.
Feeling newly inspired,
the runners donned their
running shoes once more
– this time for a spot of
“DorchesTourism” or
to “Explorchester” (you
can decide which Strava
title is best). Some of the
wondrous sights visited
on the gentle jog around
the town of 19,000
included a number of
Roman artefacts including
an amphitheatre, an exca-
vated town house, and a
trip down some famously
straight Roman roads. A
Hardy few then travelled
Far from the Madding
Crowd to see the house
of 20th
century author
Thomas Hardy (author of
Tess of the D’Urbervilles
and other works).
The team returned to
the house exhausted, but
there was little time for
rest: some tasty fajitas
were rustled up for dinner,
energetic post-meal games
were played, and then it
was time to hit the town.
Dorchester – not known
for its nightlife – provided
the weary students with
reasonably priced alcohol
and much merriment, as
well as a DJ who seemed
willing to take literally
any requests and play
them no questions asked.
All this, combined with
a dancefloor containing a
wide range of odd locals,
led to much amusement
and fun was had by all.
On the way home, the
team stopped off at the
overpriced, monopolistic
kebab shop to refuel after a
busy day and settled down
for a short sleep before the
traditional Sunday long
run the following day.
After the keenest
athletes completed a quick
circumnavigation of the
town, they returned and
collected their slightly
better-rested friends for
a run out and around
“Britain’s finest Iron Age
hill fort”: Maiden Castle.
To the disappointment of
almost everyone, it soon
became apparent that
there is no actual castle
at Maiden Castle and it
is in fact just a hill. This
took nothing away from
the blissful fresh air and
stunning countryside
views on offer, however,
and they completed many
laps around the summit
before returning home to
shower, eat, and pack.
The return journey to
London was (fortunately)
far less eventful than the
outward journey and the
exhausted team cruised
back to campus by 18:30
on Sunday evening.
Hopefully the runners
will be fully recovered in
time for team’s next race
on Wednesday for the
LUCA XC League at Ally
Pally – the hilliest (and
muddiest?) so far. For
