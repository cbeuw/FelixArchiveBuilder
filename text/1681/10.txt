Say it with DNA – how our genetic code could hold
the key to our data storage problems
We’re generating more data than ever before, but where are we going to store it? Some scientists are pinning their
hopes on using the building blocks of life to help solve the issue.

D
ata has been
hailed as the
oil of this
century. Just
like oil, entire industries
rely on data analytics to
develop consumer-centric
products, which are now-
adays in constant demand.
Google Search, Facebook
Recommendations, and
pretty much everything
else on the Internet has
become part of new
‘Data Economy’. Every
single day a large mass
of data is created and
stored: a joint research
project by Seagate, the
world’s leading hard
drive manufacturer, and
IDC analytics, predicts
that the total amount of
data worldwide will reach
163 Zettabytes (ZB) by
the year 2025 – a tenfold
increase from the 16.1 ZB
generated in 2016. To put
into perspective, one ZB
is equal to a trillion GB.
This is an explosive rate
of data generation! Much
of this data is managed
by few large tech giants
like Google, Facebook,
Amazon, and Microsoft,

measures. The solution?
Recently there has been
an interest in replacing
magnetic tapes and sil-
icon-based hard drives
with DNA, which could
be the next generation of
storage.
Though you may find
it surprising, using DNA
for information storage is
not as strange as you may
think. Nature has always
used DNAto encode all of
life’s genetic information,
and the latest research has
used its innate properties
to store digital informa-
tion. In 2012, the Church
lab at Harvard University
displayed the potential of
DNA as storage platform
by encoding a 53,426
word book, eleven JPG
images, and one Javascript
program using next-gen-
eration DNA synthesis
and sequencing platforms.
Digital information is
stored as strings of binary
digits (bits) holding only
the values as zeroes
and ones, while genetic
information is stored
in a sequence of four
chemical bases –Adenine,
Guanine, Cytosine, and
Thymine. In both cases, it
is the sequence and rules
of interpretation which
encode the information.
By mapping the bits to
base sequences, one can
transfer digital infor-
mation to its chemical
equivalent. To access the
information, the DNA is
sequenced, and sequences
of eight bases used to
retrieve the digital infor-
mation.
What advantages can
this bring? Well, one gram
of DNA can store 215
petabytes (PB). While
conventional hard drives
last for an average of
5fiveyears, DNA is far
more resilient – in fact, it
is one of the most stable
chemicals found on Earth,
being found preserved
in remains thousands of
years old, despite harsh
conditions. Some have
even called DNA apoca-
lypse proof! If humanity
suffers a disaster, then
future generations will
be able to access the in-
formation stored on DNA
memory sticks to recreate
our civilization.
So,whyisDNAstorage
not yet mainstream?
Because both the steps of
chemically synthesizing
DNA and sequencing are
slow processes – very
slow compared to the
lightning fast information
storage and retrieval we
are used to. Furthermore,
the sequencing process is
error prone, with the error
increasing with increasing
lengths of DNA. The other
issue is that sequencing
is a linear, end to end
process and, without a
robust encoding scheme,
it is very challenging
to retrieve make data
randomly accessible. For
example, if you wanted
to find a key passage on
a book written on DNA
then you will have to read

Y
ou may be
aware that
there are
c u r r e n t l y
growing efforts to clone
long-extinct animals
such as mammoths,
which would be sure
to put a smile on John
Hammond’s face. There
is a growing consensus
in the scientific com-
munity that we should
use similar technology
to resurrect recently
extinct animals. There
are a number of criteria
a species must fit into,
in order to be selected
as a potential candidate,
including preservation
of viable genetic mate-
rial and the existence of
suitable habitat for rein-
troduction. We are not
talking about a mosquito
in amber here; instead,
the species for which
such a project could be
viable are those that have
become extinct within
the past 100 years. There
may be potential along the
way to learn more about
As an Amphibian Bi-
ologist, I could not help
but pick this first example
– the gastric brooding
frog (Rheobatrachus
spp.). There were two
closely related species
that were discovered in
the latter half of the 20th
century, shortly before
they became extinct. They
acquired their name from
the unusual behaviour
exhibited by the females
incubating their eggs:
they would swallow the
fertilised eggs and convert
their stomach into a frog
nursery, before regurgitat-
ing fully-formed froglets
approximately six weeks
later. During this time,
the mother shuts down all
function of her stomach
and does not eat until her
brood have developed. In
2013, scientists in Aus-
tralia successfully created
a living embryo from pre-
served genetic material,
with the next goal being
the production of an
embryo that can survive
to the tadpole stage.
The second species is
the Thylacine or Tasma-
nian tiger (Thylacinus cy-
nocephalus), which was a
marsupial predator hunted
to extinction by mankind.
They were already on the
way out before a bounty
was put on their head, but
it certainly did not help
things! The Australian
Museum in Sydney began
a cloning project in 1999
with efforts still ongoing,
using ethanol-fixed tissue
from a handful of spec-
imens. There are deep
ethical questions that
need to be addressed with
such projects, but hope-

the means to restore a
species, especially one
that disappeared due to
our direct actions, surely
we have an obligation to
do so.

The challenges have
not deterred Microsoft
from investing. In an
interview with MIT
Technology Review last
year, Microsoft unveiled
their plan of developing
“ p r o t o - c o m m e r c i a l
system in three years”
which can be used at their
data centers. Though they
can’t be used for quick
retrieval of information,
they can act as valuable
back-up for archived data.
In July 2016, Microsoft,
in collaboration with
University of Washington,
stored 200 megabytes of
data in DNA, including
a music video. 200 MB
might appear much lower
than what is desired, but
the real limit is cost, and
not science. According

market. To reduce cost,
Microsoft partnered
with Twist Bioscience, a
synthetic biology start-up.
Twist Bioscience, using
their proprietary synthesis
technology, provides rapid

ambition.
Though Microsoft may
be the only tech giant
ringing DNA-based stor-
age’s praises, academics
remain excited by the
possibilities. Dr. Nick
Goldman at European
Bioinformatics Institute is
driving research to make
DNA data storage reliable
and competent. In 2013, a
year after Church’s proof
of concept, he developed
an improved strategy
to encode digital data
into biological text. His
technique had an error
checking procedure to
ensure that data can be
both reliably encrypted
as well as interpreted.
Using this they were able
to store 739 kB of data on
DNA and retrieve it with
100% accuracy! Their en-
cryption included all 154
of Shakespeare’s sonnets,
a 26-second audio clip
of Martin Luther King’s
“I have a dream”, and
the classic paper on the
structure of DNA by
Watson and Crick. The
latest research, published
last year, from the joint
efforts of Columbia Uni-
versity and the New York
Genome Center, was able
to push the envelope even
further by encoding an
operating system, movies,
and other such files
who store it inside giant
data servers. But they
