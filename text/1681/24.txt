Lights will guide you home: catching the northern
lights in the UK
Elina Michaelidou

T
he UK has quite a
few spots where
the northern
lights, or Aurora
Borealis, are visible. As
you may have guessed
already, you have higher
chances to see them
somewhere up north,
particularly in Scotland.
However, you’ll be sur-
prised to learn that Aurora
Borealis has been noticed
as south as Oxfordshire
and Cornwall! But don’t
get too excited – this
happens rarely, and the
chances of seeing them
there with the bare eye
are definitely very low.
If conditions are almost
perfect but you still can’t
see anything, then try it
with your camera, since
the eye can’t sense many
colours in low light while
a DSLR camera sensor
can. For a more detailed
explanation, ask your
biologist friends.
What are they?
The northern lights are,
in a few words, a “light
show caused by collisions
between electrically
charged particles released
from the sun that enter the
earth’s atmosphere and
collide with gases such
as oxygen and nitrogen”,
as explained by Aurora
Service Europe. Since
this is a phenomenon
that can be seen above
both magnetic poles of
the Earth (and usually
happens at the same
time), there are also
southern lights, or Aurora
Australis. And, as the
Aurora Service mentions,
“northern and southern
auroras are mirror-like
images that occur at the
same time, with similar
shapes and colours”.
fordshire or Cornwall (if
they are strong enough).
In Northern Ireland, they
can be seen from Antrim
or Rathlin Island. And if
you’re in Wales, try the
Brecon Beacons.
For more vibrant
colours, you may prefer
to travel outside the UK.
Other European desti-
nations include Norway,
Sweden, Finland, and
Iceland. They are close
to the UK, and you can
find many good deals
on flight tickets, so keep
an eye out. In Norway,
popular viewpoints gather
close to Tromsø, Alta,
and Kirkenes; in Sweden,
check out Abisko, Juk-
kasjärvi, and Luleå; in
Finland, well-known
Aurora Borealis places
are Muotka, Kilpisjärvi,
and Luosto; and last but
not least is Iceland, where
you can see the Northern
Lights from locations just
outside of the capital Rey-
kjavik or the South Shore.
If you have more time
and money to spare, you
may want to reach further
ahead and travel up to
Greenland or Canada.
How to get there?
Another important
question is “How am I
going to get there now?”
I’m afraid to tell you that
your options are quite
limited. In order to have
more chances to see this
magical phenomenon,
you need to be away
from large cities, which
means limited or no
public transport! Even if
there’s a bus or a train, it
will most probably not be
available at the time you
want it. So your options
include finding a way to
get to the nearest town
(plane/train/bus) and
then paying someone to
drive you to your final
destination (which might
be expensive) or renting
a car yourself (either from
London or the closest
large city). Car rental
could be costly as well,
unless you are already 25
years old because most
car hire companies have
an extra fee for under 25’s
(that makes no sense to
me because you may be
26y/o but have got your
license just two days
before but that’s another
topic to discuss).
Well, what happens if
you don’t have a driver’s
license (like me) and can’t
afford to pay for overnight
taxis? Simply find a friend
who has one and ask him/
her to come with you. The
more, the merrier, and
also cheaper!
Last tips
Make sure you spend
at least a couple of nights
there. It’s not easy to
plan such a trip ahead as
weather conditions are
unpredictable. Cloudy
and foggy nights can spoil
your view. But there are
some online tools that
can help. For instance, the
aforementioned Aurora
Service Europe or Aurora
Watch UK, which report
the latest information
about the northern lights
in Europe and the UK, are
worth checking out before
travelling. They even send
out notifications and alerts
upon subscription.

Scandinavian countries are famous for offering the best views of northern lights, or Aurora Borealis, especially
visible above the North Magnetic Pole. However, getting up there may not be the best value for money. Luckily,
there are some UK locations, where you can enjoy the lights for a short study break.

Where to see them?
There are many places
in Scotland, some popular
onesincludingtheScottish
Highlands, Aberdeen-
shire, the Isle of Skye (on
my own bucket list), and
the Galloway Forest Park.
In England, you can try
viewing them at the Lake
District and even Ox-
