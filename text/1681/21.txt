Hard Sun – Five years until the world ends in this
melodramatic miniseries
F
rom writer Neil
Cross, who mas-
terminded Luther,
comes a series
that gives a twist to the
tradition of quintessential-
ly British escapist police
drama. The story follows
Elaine Renko (Agyness
Deyn) and Charlie Hicks
(Jim Sturgess), two
detectives who stumble
upon a government leak
describing ‘Hard Sun’ – a
catastrophic event that
will cause the end of the
world in 5 years’ time. Set
in an alternative present,
the six-part series weaves
a flush of expected
cop-drama themes with a
looming doomsday plot.
Butwhileittriestoseem
gritty and rough around
the edges, with a flavour-
some array of colloquial
accents and over-the-top
violence, it falls short in
establishing a realism in
all the kerfuffle. The char-
acters are drawn out in a
rudimental and clumsy
fashion, but Sturgess and
Deyn have fun with the
hammy affair, evident in
their performances. We
just go along with it. What
you get is an enjoyable
yet clichéd detective-mel-
odrama with a refreshing,
albeit side-lined, set-up.
What ensues is a slick
drama that appreciates its
premise but isn’t in love
with it; there are many
different back alleys the
plot could’ve taken but
it cops-out and strays
away from the enormous
potential in its premise.
Neil Cross sticks to what
he knows, and this can be
frustrating.
The whole series has
a certain visual style as
if it were adapted from
a graphic novel, but not
enough substance to
justify its aesthetic. Its
ambitions are clearly
set high, as it tries to
delve into an intelligent
exploration on morality,
religion, and justice, but
the frequent pantomime-y
dialogue lets itself down.
If you expect anything
more than a standard
police drama, it is pedes-
trian and dissatisfactory.
Hard Sun is bonkers,
starting with the uncon-
ventional set-up, but a
part of its indulgence is
seeing how everything
works out in the end,
apocalypse and all. It is
a lot of fun for the most
part: each episode follows
a loose formula presenting
a different murder case
that somehow, unconvinc-
ingly, relates to the ‘Hard
Sun’ of the title. The
overdramatic universe
of Hard Sun is life as we
know it, but on Class A
opioids— and that is its
pleasure. The six episodes
rivet along sweetly at
a rewarding pace. Neil
Cross goes all out this pet
project, eager to please the
fans, to flex his detective
drama muscles and Hard
Sun makes a cute addition
to his expanding résumé.
The whole series was
released on BBC iPlayer
from 6th January, made
available for a month.
With the rise in popularity
of on-demand TV and a
growing culture of binge
watching, more and
more content seems to be
moving online with all
episodes released at the
same time.
While it’s unlikely that
we will see any further of
Hard Sun and its world in
the near future, I think it
has enough of a certain
charm about it to become
an underappreciated gem
for fans of the current
wave of contemporary
British crime drama.
Hard Sun is available
on BBC iPlayer now.
Mmmmm, brooding // BBC
Agyness Deyn and Jim Sturgess have enormous fun in Neil Cross’ show, which is completely bonkers, but fails to
make the most of its interesting premise.
