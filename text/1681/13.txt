The rowdiest gig the beacon theatre ever hosted
S
treetlight is a band
that’s impossible
to categorise. I’ve
heard ska-punk,
world, prog jazz, hardcore
folk, and a dozen other
descriptors chucked their
way, none sticking in any
sense of the word (best
I’ve seen is “mariachi
band from hell”).
But if there’s one word
descriptor agreeable to the
rowdy-devoted-vibrant
community that’s grown
around this marvellous
band, it’s formative. I
divide my experience as
a music listener into two
epocs: the pre-Streetlight
and the post-Streetlight.
Falling into the band is a
life-altering experience
like falling into a black
hole might stretch you out
a bit. Lead singer Tomas
Kalnoky released covers
of their songs as acoustic
ballads; I find them so
deeply moving that I’ve
played nylon-string
acoustic guitar for the
last five years, trying my
damnedest to sound like
him - someday I’ll be
good - . My first mosh pits
were at Streetlight shows
- and nobody moshes
better than those crazy
motherfuckers - . The fun-
damentals of my very taste
in music were decided
one fateful day when a
much younger I stumbled
across them by chance.
Dallas. Cleveland.
Burlington. The three
thousand in attendance
(the show sold out) must
have, altogether, traveled
a hundred thousand miles
to see this show. This
isn’t unusual. When I saw
Kalnoky solo in London,
a steady crowd of indi-
viduals bearing Streetlight
tattoos regaled their
stories of flying to the US
to catch them on tour. Here
in NYC, I heard stories of
concerts in Portland, LA,
Orlando — all fantastic,
all moving, all beautiful.
It’s said that the Mountain
Goats have a passionate
following; funny, then,
the crossover fanbase.
After the house lights
forty-piece orchestra was
not there for show; they
wasted no time leaping
into audaciously-layered
rhythms and exotical-
ly-flavored harmony,
wonderously syncopated
and perfectly comple-
menting the ska-punk
nucleus performing at
the front of the stage. The
crowd was exuberant; they
wasted precisely no time
before expressing their
loves with throaty shouts
of adoration for the band.
The setlist meandered
from folk ballads evoking
rustic frustration at a gov-
ernment in its waning days
(underscored by the anti-
capitalism of the fanbase)
to skanking bangers pre-
sented in orchestral glory
(“A Moment of Silence,”
disintegrating into the
flatout-punk “A Moment
of Violence”). There
were quick and animated
songs with flourishing
fanfares (see “We Will
Fall Together”) and
fleeting, tender slow bits
(“It’s a Wonderful Life,”
and slow by Streetlight
standards). The end of the
(non-encore) setlist was
an amalgamation of pure
energy: “What a Wicked
Gang are We”, “If and
When We Rise Again”,
and the pathos-rich “Re-
ceiving End of it All”.
Tomas told us not to sit
down for the last one, but
it’s not like anyone was
anyways at that point.
A jaw-dropping
addition to the band was a
piano soloist, Guy Mintus
- and now forever known
in Streetlight mythos as
“Mr Piano Guy,” as per
Kalnoky’s comment - .
Mintus, a virtuoso concert
pianist, would perform
brilliant reworkings of
each song preceding the
orchestra, and dazzled
all present with the his
sheer musicianship
involved. A few screams
pleaded with Streetlight
to make Mr Piano Guy
an ordinary member of
the band - and for the
record, he’d fit right in - .
Time and time again,
Streetlight Manifesto
brings unparalleled
energy to the stage, elec-
trifying the audience and
galvanizing them to the
band. There’s a reason
they have such a loyal
following: to this day,
Streetlight manages to
demonstrate that they are
in a league of their own.
One last thing: rumor
on the street is that a
UK tour is in the works.
See you there, chumps.

What’s the Story? (Brotherly Furore?)
Nine years after Oasis’ acrimonius split, the Gallagher brothers are still at it, desperately clamouring to be the
better sibling. With a new solo album out from each, Ziying Fang gives his verdict on who came out on top.

A
h, the solo
album. The
bastard child
of the ageing
artist. The vanity project
marketed at the die-hard
fans who couldn’t deal
with the terrible truth that
their favourite band broke
up nearly a decade ago,
now reduced to eating
the crumbs that fell off
the table. “Critics be
damned”, they agonise,
“this album showcases
their raw, untainted,
talent and personality”.
DENIAL. Desperately,
they cling onto the notion
that had they had the cour-
age to risk an affair with
the capricious mistress
of Fame and Fortune, it
could’ve been them. Alas.
Their only recourse now
is to fork out £10 a month
to Spotify and Apple
Music to support the artist
in their cocaine and caviar
habits. That or deal with
the crushing mediocrity
that is life itself.
But what do I know,
maybe I’m just bitter that
everyone else’s favourite
bands (Gorillaz, The
Killers, The Strokes, U2)
had a new release last
year. Yet, the only thing
Arctic Monkeys fans got
was a disappointing me-
teorological event sharing
a name with the track
‘Brianstorm’.
But look at me dancing
around the issue. Dancey,
dancey, dancey, la di da.
ALRIGHT, LET’S GET
TO THE POINT. Are
the new albums by the
Gallagher brothers good?
YES. MAYBE. Are they
better than Oasis? NO.
What you have to
understand is that for any
album to be comparable
with Oasis, it has to be in-
ventive both lyrically and
melodically. Not enough
on the lyrical front, like
Noel’s Who Built the
Moon, and you’re left
feeling you’ve wasted
time on the ‘artsy fartsy’,
like an evening out listen-
“It has all the
comforts of
a Bruce Willis
movie. You go
to it when you
need to turn
your brain off.”
ing to prog-rock backed
Poetry Slam. Not enough
on the melodic front, like
Liam’s As You Were, and it
feels like you’re being fed
a stream of half-cooked
metaphors-cum-advice
until the point you’d like
to ram a sharp implement
through your own head.
(Do not try this at home).
Songs like ‘Wonderwall’,
for the lack of a better
phrase, do wonder simply
because they so readily
convey the type of mid-
dle-class comfort and
inarticulacy that culmi-
nates in phrases like “...all
the road we have to walk
are winding”. A banal
platitude, sure, but a banal
platitude that in the lens of
Oasis sounds like genuine
life advice.
I am, of course, aware
that there may be Oasis
fans reading this review
right now. And to be com-
pletely honest, it’s not all
that fair for me to tear apart
any emotional attachment
anyone has constructed
around the phenomenon
of Britpop. I should know
better; I spent my form-
ative years listening to
Nirvana and Janis Joplin
trying to dig my way out
of the awkward years of
schoolboy adolescence.
Much of music criticism
IS subjective, and I would
be lying if I said that I
don’t derive as much
joy as I do from hating
Taylor Swift if I weren’t
satisfying myself on the
fact that I am attacking
the people who didn’t
share the same experience
growing up as I did. (The
bloody wankers never
seem to have needed to
deal with puberty and
the immense self-doubt
that came with it.) The
truth is, Oasis wrote their
own music, and that,
by definition, puts them
above 70% of pop music
today. Liam Gallagher
may have as much of way
with words as a grizzly
bear on ice has a talent for
ballet, but I suppose that’s
part of his charm. The
same can be said of Noel,
whose ‘Holy Mountain’
reminds me pleasantly of
Franz Ferdinand and their
psychedelic pussyfooting
in asking a girl on a date.
Is it a material for Nobel
Prize for Literature?
Perhaps not, but it has all
the comforts of a Bruce
Willis movie. You go to
it when you need to turn
your brain off.
Nonetheless, if you’re
not a fan and belong the
group of people who read
reviews to see what’s
worth your time, I would
say go for Noel’s album.
It’s the lesser of two evils:
Liam can come off as
abrasive, and the stealing
of canned phrases from
the Beatles does get on
your nerve when he does it
the Nth time. (It took me 4
weeks to stopped cringing
when he unthinkingly
parodies Lennon’s ‘Hap-
piness Is A Warm Gun’).
When you get used to it,
and let the melody wash
over the lyrics, it is pretty
pleasant. But before that,
the choice of ‘Chinatown’
as a romantic setting just
conjures images of damp
streets, massage parlours
and pick-pockets in
Leicester Square. You’d
think the brothers would
have taken a song-writ-
ing course with their all
Britpop success by now.
