T
he physics
department has
warned students
to be “mindful
of your behaviour and
conversations” in a
“gentle reminder” to
promote respect and
courtesy.
An email sent at the
beginning of this term
told students that the
department is “committed
to promoting an environ-
ment where everyone is
treated with respect and
courtesy” and urged all
students to play their part
in doing this.
It goes on to say:

StudentAcademic ChoiceAwards set to officially open
nominations this week
will have its official
launch this Monday,
15th January.
The awards, which
the Union describe as
the “flagship event for
empowering students to
recognise, reward, and
celebrate excellence
among College staff”,
have been running for the
past six years.
College staff can be
nominated by students
across eight categories,
such as ‘Best Supervision’
and ‘Best Support Staff’.
Last year 831 nom-
inations were received
in total for the SACAs,
the most they had ever
received since their inau-
guration in 2012; ‘Best
Teaching for Undergradu-
ates’was the most popular
category, with nearly 300
nominations received.
Nick Burstow, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Education), described the
SACAs as “the best cam-
paign the Union runs.”
He told Felix: “I can
guarantee that every single
student here will know
at least one staff member
they will remember
long after they graduate,
because of the positive
impact that member of
staff has had.”
“We all know how
great we feel when we’re
congratulated and thanked
for a job well done, and
we mustn’t forget that our
teachers and support staff
are just the same. It’s so
important that we take a
couple of minutes to say
“thank you” and let that
member of staff know we
appreciate all they do for
us.”
Nominees will receive
a branded SACA mug,
and the shortlisted staff
will be invited to the
awards ceremony on May
14th.
Nominations may be
made online at the Union
website.

prompted by any specific
incident, suggesting no
formal complaint has been
made at this time.
One physics undergrad-
uate Felix spoke to iden-
tified sexism as “a really
widespread issue”, saying:
“The conversations in the
computer suite are pretty
disgusting, and you can
always overhear some-
thing offensive. Hearing
conversations about
graphic sexual violence is
really commonplace.”
They also told Felix
that “people really love to
shit on the department.”
Over the past few years
the Department of Physics
has faced a number of
problems with student
satisfaction: in last year’s
National Student Survey
they came last in terms of
satisfaction, while student
unhappiness led to a drop
in the league tables last
year.
The Department of
Physics was this month
taken over by Professor
Michele Dougherty, who
replaced Dr Kenny Weir,
the acting Head of Depart-
ment.
The email concludes
by referring students to
details on the College’s
complaint procedures
and a sexual misconduct
survey, which closed
earlier this week, run by
the National Union of
Students. Students facing
harassment are advised
to talk to their personal or
senior tutors before taking
any formal action.

Dame Glynis
Breakwell has been at
the centre of a long-
running argument
around senior pay at
universities.
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
T
he vice-chan-
cellor of Bath
University is
facing pressure
to leave immediately
following a controversy
over high pay.
Dame Glynis Break-
well made £471,000 in the
year up to April 2017, and
had received thousands of
pounds in benefits in kind,
when she announced her
retirement last November.
She planned to step down
from her role at the end of
November 2018 and take
a six month sabbatical.
This would allow her to
continue to collect her
full salary until February
2019.

buildings confirmed safe
A
review of the
cladding used
on faculty
buildings has
confirmed they pass
regulations.
The tests, which were
ordered by the gov-
ernment following the
Grenfell Tower fire, were
carried out over the past
several months, with as-
sistance from an external
consultant. The review
found none of the build-

review were made avail-
able to Felix around five
months after Woodward
Buildings, in North
Acton, was found to have
cladding that failed the
safety tests. When asked
in December of last year,
a College spokesperson
told Felix they were
awaiting tests carried out
by the Building Research
Establishment (BRE) and
advice from consultants
before carrying out the
replacement. They said:
“We expect to have the
results from these tests
early in the new year and
will take all necessary
steps.”
The review was unable
to identify the exact spec-
ifications and origins of
the polycarbonate panels
used to build the green-
house atop the Roderic
Hill building. A spokes-
person for the College
said polycarbonate “often
contains some form of
additional fire retardant”,
and the panels usually
have a “reasonable” level
of flame resistance. The
greenhouse, which is not
part of Roderic Hill itself,
was established in 2012 as
part of Imperial’s invest-
ment in plant sciences.
The tests were ordered
following the tragic Gren-
fell Tower fire, which
began on the 14th June
2017, and spread rapidly
through the 24-storey
structure, leaving 71
people dead.
second Dame Glynis has
faced in recent months
– the university’s court
has urged Dame Glynis
to leave immediately.
It further said that the
university’s council had
acted beyond its power
in granting Dame Glynis
the six month sabbatical.
The court’s role is only
advisory and the council
may reject its suggestions.
Dame Glynis made
headlines when she was
revealed to be the UK’s
highest paid vice-chancel-
lor. Her salary of £468,000
a year was supplemented
by an interest-free loan
of £31,000 (which has
since been written off)
for a car, an allowance
for a housekeeper for her
£1.6 million Georgian
townhouse, and thou-
sands of pounds claimed
in expenses. In the past
academic year, Dame
Glynis had also received
a pay increase worth more
than the annual salary of
some of Bath University’s
employees.
The lengthy row over
vice-chancellors’ pay
prompted former univer-
sities minister Jo Johnson
to set out plans requiring
universities to publish
details of staff earning
more than £100,000
and justify salaries over
£150,000 to the Office
for Students (OfS). The
OfS has also attracted
criticism lately over the
appointment of journalist
and free schools advocate
Toby Young to its board.
Young resigned following
a backlash over misogy-
nistic, ableist, and classist
remarks made on Twitter
and in his columns.
Imperial College
London has one of the
highest numbers of high-
ly-remunerated employ-
ees, with 130 employees
above £150,000 per
annum.
Professor Alice
Gast, the President of
the College, was paid
£430,000 in 2015/16,
making her the sec-
ond-highest paid head of a
Russell Group university.
A College spokesperson
Felix spoke to last Sep-
tember said: “Imperial is
a world top-ten university,
offering the very best in
education, science, and
innovation. Our success
depends on attracting
world-class talent, and
our remuneration reflects
that.”
