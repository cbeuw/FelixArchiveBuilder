A messy, ham-fisted take on race and violence
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri heads into the Oscars race as a front-runner, but Martin McDonagh’s
third feature tries to take on the heavy-hitting topic of police brutality, and falls flat.
T
hree Billboards
Outside Ebbing,
Missouri, shows
what writer
and director Martin
McDonagh does best:
write sharp, exple-
tive-filled dialogue that
snaps across the screen
like it was created by
Aaron Sorkin’s angry kid
brother. Over the course of
two previous features, and
numerous stage works,
McDonagh has set himself
apart as one of the most
unique directors working
today. Unfortunately,
Three Billboards also
highlights his weaknesses,
displaying an anathema
for well-rounded charac-
terisation, an inability to
achieve tonal balance, and
a complete avoidance of
nuance.
Set in the small town
of Ebbing – a non-specific
location that serves as a
stand-in for any number
of generic ‘Midwestern’
locales – Three Billboards
is set seven months after
the vicious rape and
murder of teenagerAngela
Hayes. It is a crime that
remains unsolved, leading
Angela’s mother, Mildred
(Frances McDormand), to
purchase three billboards
along the road where her
daughter was killed, re-
minding the townspeople
that justice has not been
served. “It seems like the
local police department
is too busy goin’ round
torturing black folks to be
bothered doing anything
about solving actual
crime”, as Mildred put
it, referring to the racial
tensions that lie at the
heart of the film.
This decision of Mc-
Donagh’s – to wrap his
snappy language around
the incredibly emotive
issue of police brutality
– is the film’s ultimate
downfall. He thrusts
issues of race into the
narrative with a complete
lack of nuance or tact,
embodying them in the
character of Office Dixon
(Sam Rockwell); while
he might not be the only
racist member of Ebbing’s
police department, he is
the most racist, bearing
responsibility for the
aforementioned tortur-
ing of people of color.
Throughout the film he
continually intimidates
the few minority char-
acters present, and uses
disproportionate levels of
force without any serious
repercussions.
His ‘lovable hick’ char-
acter is, supposedly, coun-
tered by Bill Willoughby
(Woody Harrelson), the
town’s sheriff. Claiming
to be committed to justice
for Angela in spirit, if not
quite in practice, he still
continues to happily have
racist thugs in his team
and needs to be spurred
into action by Mildred.
McDonagh counters the
implications of Willough-
by’s inactions by playing
a sympathy card that is
offensively obvious to
the audience, and giving
him terminal cancer. If
this is supposed to remind
us that morality is not a
black and white affair, as
McDonagh has exhorted
in numerous interviews,
it is done without nuance,
and with a completely
straight face.
While it may not
directly mine a Trumpian
seam of perceived injus-
tice against the police,
make no mistake: Three
Billboards is, at its heart,
a Blue Lives Matter film,
telling us we should
forgive racist cops who
feel free to torture or kill
black folks, provided they
neatly learn their lessons
within a 115-minute
runtime. Topics as urgent
and emotionally-resonant
as modern-day racism
and sexual violence are
handled in a completely
tone-deaf manner – all
the more inexcusable
now the cultural dialogue
surrounding them has
become a roar.
McDonagh has made
a choice to set himself
against a standard it is
difficult for any filmmak-
er to measure up to; but
when he makes the choice
to not include any black
characters in the main
cast, it implies McDonagh
sees the political context
as little more than fodder
for the film’s necessary
redemptive arc. The
closest we come to a ful-
ly-realised black character
– in a film where race is
a central focus – is one of
Angela’s coworkers, who
is arrested for possession
of weed. A crime for
which African-Americans
are arrested at four times
the rate as Caucasians, is a
mere narrative device.
The other major failure
is a confusion about
what kind of film Three
Billboards is supposed to
be, lurching from black
comedy to serious drama
within the space of a
couple of lines. It’s a jux-
taposition that lessens the
impact of the truly great
moments within the piece
– and make no mistake,
there are some really
brilliant scenes within
the film. By the credits
roll, this ricocheting back
and forth – with detours
into sickly sentimentality
and teen angst – leaves
one feeling rather queasy,
having seen two half-de-
cent films rather than a
complete work.
Three Billboards is at
its best when it serves as
a platform for McDor-
mand’s acting chops. Her
Mildred is by turns fierce
and maternal, and McDor-
mand manages to convey
a bitter world-weariness
that has imprinted itself
upon Mildred’s entire
being. A current front-
runner to collect the Best
Actress Oscar in March, it
would be a well-deserved
win, since she carries
much of the film. There
are strong supporting
turns from the rest of the
cast, who – with a few
exceptions – uniformly
deliver: Lucas Hedges
is affecting as Mildred’s
son, who just wants to
move on without being
constantly reminded of
his sister’s murder, and
Harrelson is convincing,
even if his lines are not.
Even Peter Dinklage plays
his part well, although
his character’s inclusion
seems to just be an excuse
for McDonagh to use the
word ‘midget’ throughout
the script.
Ultimately, despite the
best efforts of the cast,
the film’s screenplay is
what lets it down. While
McDonagh managed to do
well with In Bruges, his
Belgian-set caper, Three
Billboards has him biting
off far more than he can
chew. It’s cinema where
the harrowing nature of
police brutality can be
used as a mere backdrop;
where emotional tone
fluctuates so wildly as
to leave you nauseated;
where expletives serve as
a stand-in for well-written
lines. It’s not as clever as it
thinks it is, and absolutely
nowhere near as clever as
it needs to be.

OUTSIDE EBBING,

Is time up for Woody Allen?
At one point, it seemed that #MeToo and Time’s Up would pass director Woody Allen by, but things are starting to
change, as more actors disavow their relationships with him.

L
ittle over three
months have
passed since alle-
gations of sexual
misconduct against movie
industry czar Harvey
Weinstein emerged, and
since then the flood of re-
ports of Hollywood abuse
shows no sign of abating.
Not only have more vic-
tims of Weinstein come
out of the shadows – more
than 80 as things currently
stand – but others have
also faced accusations of
heinous misconduct, from
Kevin Spacey to Jeffrey
Tambor. Some, like Louis
C.K., have confirmed the
accusations, and offered
to make amends; others
staunchly proclaim their
innocence. Barely a week
goes by without new
crimes coming to light
– if your favourite actor
is trending on Twitter,
there’s a fair chance it
could be because allega-
tions have emerged.
“One figure
who had thus
far seemed
immune to
the #MeToo
movement was
Woody Allen”
“The #MeToo
movement has
now drawn a
clear line in
the sand for
Hollywood”
‘The Silence Breakers’
were even chosen as TIME
magazine’s ‘Person of
the Year’, in recognition
of the profound cultural
shift. One figure who has
thus far seemed immune
to the #MeToo movement,
however, is director
Woody Allen. This might
be about to change.
Allen’s career has long
had a sense of unease
attached, dating back
25 years, to 1992, when
Dylan Farrow – the
adoptive daughter of
his then-partner Mia
Farrow – accused him of
sexually assaulting her.
She was seven at the time.
Farrow’s allegations were
investigated by leading
doctors at the Yale-New
Haven Hospital’s Child
Sexual Abuse Clinic,
who concluded that they
were fabricated, but their
report has been criticised
by some. While the state
attorney said that there
was “probable cause”
to pursue Allen legally,
the case was eventually
dropped. Since then,
whenever the topic of
conversation turns to
Allen, it isn’t long before
someone brings up the
case; “and have you seen
his films?” they’ll say,
“it’s no surprise”.
It is true that Allen does
himself no favours with
his filmography. Even as
someone who loves much
of his work, it’s easy to
see some of the problems
in the films, which typ-
ically revolve around a
wide age-gap between the
main romantic couples
in his films. Throughout
his films, he continually
returns to the trope of a
young ingenue, taken in
by an older, more experi-
enced man. The gap has
been known to push close
to 40 years in some films,
and in Manhattan, his best
work, Allen’s character is
in a relationship with a
high school student, 26
years younger than him.
But while all of it add
up to a pretty grim picture,
many actors have been
happy to continue working
with Allen. At one point,
it might have seemed that
the #MeToo revolution
was going to pass him
by; indeed, in December
Dylan wrote an op-ed
in the LA Times, asking
why actors like Kate
Winslet and Blake Lively
were quick to criticise
Weinstein and speak out
in favour of the change in
mood, but also defended
their work with Allen.
Winslet, for example, said
“as the actor…you just
have to step away and say,
I don’t know anything,
really…Woody Allen is
an incredible director.”
Things have since
shifted. One by one,
actors who had previously
worked withAllen, or who
have projects with him,
are stating their regret.
Ellen Page called working
with Allen “the biggest
regret of my career”,
while Mira Sorvino, who
won an Academy Award
for her role in Allen’s
Mighty Aphrodite, wrote
an open letter apologising
to Dylan for having her
watch “someone you
called out as having hurt
you…be lauded again and
again.”
Greta Gerwig, who
worked with Allen in
To Rome With Love, has
said “if I had known
then what I know now, I
would not have acted in
the film.” The director,
actor, and screenwriter
went on to say that she
would never work with
him again. Rebecca Hall
and Timothee Chalamet,
meanwhile, who both
appear in Allen’s latest
work A Rainy Day in New
York, are both donating
their salaries to charities,
including Time’s Up, and
Hall has said she will not
work with him again.
This information
about Allen has been
common knowledge for
many years, so what has
changed? As the talk
around sexual misconduct
in Hollywood has reached
a crescendo, it is harder
and harder for actors to
plead ignorance about
who they’re working
with; this is especially
true in a case like Allen’s,
where his alleged victims
have written, in pains-
taking detail, about the
impact his actions have
had on their lives. There is
also another sea change:
more and more people
are waking up to the true
nature of sexual miscon-
duct, which is centred
around power, and is just
one product of the culture
in which we live. We can’t
blame the individual; we
need to look at how we all
contribute to the problem,
and this extends to the
actors.
Does this mark the end
of Allen’s career? It’s dif-
ficult to say at this stage,
but it is certain that the
#MeToo movement has
drawn a line in the sand
for many in Hollywood –
whether or not he goes on
making films, things will
never be the same.
Greta Gerwig has said she will not work with Allen again, while Timothée Chalamet is donating his salary // CC
Amid this awful
deluge, however, some-
thing good has emerged:
women, within both the
film industry and society
in general, are standing
up, using hashtags like
#MeToo or creating organ-
isations like Time’s Up.
