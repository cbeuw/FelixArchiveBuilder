Sundance Film Festival: Start as you mean to go on
FILM
Ashley Luckyram

I
n 1978 the very
first Sundance Film
Festival took place,
with the goal of
showcasing the potential
of American independent
cinema. On offer were
films from the likes of
Martin Scorsese and Elia
Kazan. It is fair to say
that since then Sundance
has been an integral
part of the independent
film revolution. If John
Cassavetes was the father
that conceived American
independent cinema,
then Robert Redford’s
Sundance Institute was
the loving mother that
tenderly nurtured it. A
decade later a 26 year old
Steven Soderbergh took
his directorial debut to
Park City, claiming the
Audience Award at the
festival, and going on to
win the prestigious Palme
d’Or at the Cannes Film
Festival, as well as earn-
ing an Academy Award
nomination for Original
Screenplay. Sex, Lies,
and Videotape would go
on to be a huge financial
success, signalling the
acceptance of young run-
and-gun indie filmmakers
into both the hearts of the
mainstream public and
the minds of the upper
echelons of world cinema.
In the quarter of a century
since then the likes of
Paul Thomas Anderson,
Quentin Tarantino,
Darren Aronofsky, Kelly
Reichardt, Wes Anderson,
Ava DuVernay, Damian
Chazelle and David
O. Russell have all
gotten their big break at
Sundance, either through
the Institute’s many film
programs, workshops, and
labs, or through premier-
ing their early projects at
the festival, underlining
Sundance’s prominence
in shaping the modern
cinematic landscape.
Yet the last couple of
editions of the Sundance
Film Festival have seen
a further evolution, with
prestigious films pre-
miering there in the hope
of scoring major awards
more than a year later.
Cases in point include
2014’s Whiplash, which
went on to score five
Oscar nominations, and
2016’s Manchester by
the Sea, which went on to
earn six. Last year’s stellar
line-up continued this
trend, with Get Out, The
Big Sick, Mudbound, and,
in particular, Call Me by
Your Name all hoping for
nods when the Academy
Award nominations are
announced next week.
The festival has always
served as something of a
shop window – for those
with films playing this is
not a traditionally enjoy-
able time, as their agents
and producers desperately
seek distribution deals.
2017 saw an all-time high
for films being picked
up, with the likes of A24,
Amazon, and Netflix
being serial offenders. As
ever, the festival contin-
ued to put a diverse range
of voices on display:
LGBTQ+ films had a
strong showing with Call
Me by Your Name, God’s
Own Country, and Beach
Rats; Asian-American life
was given the spotlight
in Columbus and Gook;
and female directors
Eliza Hittman, Dee Rees,
Maggie Betts, and Gillian
Robespierre earned some
of the best reviews of the
fortnight.
Perhaps most notable
were the astonishingly
small-scale films that
meditatively dealt with
colossal themes of time
and memory in A Ghost
Story and Marjorie Prime.
Twelve months ago we
were delivered one of
the finest Sundances in
history, and a very good
year followed, with an
extremely diverse Oscar
race still yet to play out.
Let us now turn our at-
tention to what the 2018
festival has in store.
As usual with
Sundance, a host of the
films on show are debuts
from new faces, and a
great part of the fun is
discovering budding
Andersons, Tarantinos,
Soderberghs, and Aro-
deliver awards friendly
crowd-pleasers such as
Good Will Hunting and
Milk, but far better known
for his quirky indies such
as My Own Private Idaho
and Drugstore Cowboy.
Appreciated worldwide,
as evidenced by his Palme
d’Or win for the haunting
Elephant, Van Sant has
recently been on a poor
run of form epitomised by
the much-maligned Sea of
Trees. He enters Sundance
with Don’t Worry, He
Won’t Get Far On Foot, a
dark comedy biopic based
on controversial quad-
riplegic cartoonist John
Callahan. The intriguing
subject of the film will
be portrayed by Joaquin
Phoenix, reuniting with
the man who directed
him in his breakthrough
performance more than
twenty years ago in To
Die For. Phoenix is joined
by a strong cast including
Rooney Mara, Jonah Hill,
and Jack Black, and the
project already has a May
release date with Amazon
Studios. Here’s to hoping
for a return to form for
Van Sant.

Twelve months ago Sundance kicked off a wonderful year for film – what will the 2018 edition bring?
It is increasingly
common for actors, and
those in other fields, to
make their directorial
debut at Sundance. Last
year saw Taylor Sheridan
complete the border
trilogy he wrote, follow-
ing up Sicario and Hell or
High Water by stepping
into the director’s chair
with Wind River. This
year it is the turn of Paul
Dano (period drama
Wildlife), Rupert Everett
(Oscar Wilde adaptation
The Happy Prince), Idris
Elba (crime film Yardie),
comedian Bo Burnham
(comedy Eighth Grade)
and rapper Boots Riley
(comedic fantasy sci-fi
Sorry to Bother You).
Though not making their
debuts, the relatively in-
experienced Ethan Hawke
(country music biopic
Blaze) and cinematogra-
pher Reed Morano (sci-fi
I Think We’re Alone Now),
fresh from dominating
TV with The Handmaid’s
Tale, are in the U.S.
Dramatic Competition.
Returning to Park
City are festival veterans
Tamara Jenkins, the
Zellner brothers, Debra
Granik, Brett Haley,
and Desiree Akhavan. It
has been 11 years since
Jenkins premiered superb
comedy The Savages to
huge critical acclaim at
Sundance. Her latest, The
Private Life, sounds in a
similar vein, with Kathryn
Hahn as an author under-
going fertility treatment,
placing strain on her
relationship with her
husband, Paul Giamatti.
The Zellners impressed
with their last two films,
Kid-Thing and Kumiko,
the Treasure Hunter, at
fourAcademyAwards and
gave Jennifer Lawrence a
breakthrough role. Little
is known about her new
feature, Leave No Trace,
but expect another gritty,
hard-hitting drama. Haley
is a Sundance regular, and
is back again with Hearts
Beat Louder, a piece about
an unlikely father-daugh-
ter song-writing duo,
featuring Sasha Lane.
Lane, who broke out with
a starring role in Andrea
Arnold’s 2016 Cannes
prize-winning road film
American Honey, is also
in Akhavan’s follow-up to
the notable debut Appro-
priate Behaviour. Based
on the novel by Emily M.
Danforth, The Miseduca-
tion of Cameron Post is a
coming-of-age tale about
a girl discovering her own
sexuality.
Gary Oldman showing us how it’s done-kirk
D
arkest Hour
begins and ends
with a cacoph-
ony of yelling.
And in the 120 minutes
between these two shots,
there is plenty more shout-
ing, although none do so
louder or more verbosely
than Gary Oldman, who
transforms himself into
Winston Churchill for this
film about the early days
of his premiership.
Director Joe Wright
chooses to narrow his
focus down to a period
of a few weeks, from
Churchill’s assumption
of the premiership against
the wishes of his own
party, to his famous “We
shall fight on the beaches”
speech, during which
time the evacuation of
Dunkirk was completed.
While Wright expands his
scope to include a number
of peripheral charac-
ters, including Winnie
Churchill (Kristin Scott
Thomas) and secretary
Elizabeth Layton (Lily
James), it’s clear that this
is Oldman’s film. It’s the
right decision, and allows
the film to rattle along at a
rather lively place, whilst
also showing a point
in Churchill’s narrative
when he wasn’t a national
hero. That being said,
the fact we know he will
eventually be absolved
removes some of the
precariousness from the
story.
Oldman manages to
undergo, with help from
heavy prosthetics, a star-
tling transformation into
the Prime Minister – a feat
made more impressive
when we consider how
fixed Churchill’s image is
in our cultural conscious-
ness. Oldman allows his
Churchill to let his guard
down at a number of points
in the film – particularly
the scenes with his wife,
for which Scott Thomas
doesn’t get nearly enough
screen time. Rather than
going down the traditional
route, well-trodden by
those who have played
Churchill in the past, and
portraying him as merely
blustery and irritable,
Oldman pulls together a
number of nuances and
affectations to make his
Churchill a more rounded
character. At key points
in the drama, however,
he reverts to type, huffing
and puffing through his
lines.
It’s lucky for Wright
that Oldman manages to
rise to the challenge, since
he elevates what would
otherwise be a forgettable
film. While Wright’s cam-
erawork is adept – despite
an over-reliance on a
number of formulaic shots
and tracking decisions
– this is a film where the
actors have been glossed
over, constrained within
a patina of overlighting,
over-costuming, and
over-scoring.
In other words, Darkest
Hour resembles any
number of other big-
budget historical dramas
– The Imitation Game,
Suffragette, The King’s
Speech – which gives
it a sense of datedness.
While it’s a style of film
that is, obviously, still
being made, alongside its
more nimble compatriots
on the road to the Oscars
it resembles a plodding
dinosaur. An enjoyable
watch, but not a film that
does much new, or stick in
the mind once the credits
have rolled.
