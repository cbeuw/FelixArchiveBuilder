T
he first time I
heard of this
book was when
I watched the
author being interviewed
on an Arab channel. Not
having watched the inter-
view from the beginning,
I didn’t know what the
novel was about, but I
was intrigued by their
discussion of Arab culture
and traditions. When I
learnt that the book fol-
lows a gay Arab man in an
unnamed Arab country, I
knew I had to read it.
The novel follows one
day in the life of Rasa,
a twenty seven-year-old
gay man, living with his
grandmother, who in the
book represents the voice
of societal expectations.
It is set in an Arab city
rocked by the events of
the Arab Spring. The day
begins with his grand-
mother finding him in bed
with Taymour, his lover
of three years, whose
wedding Rasa is to attend
that very evening.
As we follow Rasa
throughout this day we get
a clear, vivid insight into
the political uprisings, his
upbringing, Arab culture
and tradition, and the
respite that Guapa, a bar
with an underground gay
club, brings him.
Frankly, I was quite
surprised by how well
Haddad handled such
difficult themes with
relative ease. He was able
to capture so well how
stifling some cultural and
traditional expectations
can be – expectations that
are based on a nonsensical
inheritance of traditions
passed religiously down
every generation. He
deftly showed how the
concept embodied by a
small word like eib, or
shame, can be used to
dictate one’s behaviour
lest you draw too much
attention to yourself. And,
of course, let us not forget
the all too important
question attached to every
action one commits: What
would people say?
Being an Arab myself,
I completely understand
how rigid society’s defini-
tion of what is acceptable
can be, and how reluctant
people seem to be to do
anything, no matter how
insignificant the action,
for fear of how others
would perceive it. Haddad
was able to depict these re-
strictions and their conse-
quences so well in Mimi,
Rasa’s old high school
friend. Seated beside Rasa
during the wedding, she
keeps leaning in, whis-
pering to him her little
secrets – how overbearing
her mother-in-law is, how
she regrets never doing
what she wanted but what
society demanded of her.
While the novel is
easy to read, the writing
did seem slightly stilted
at times and one can tell
that this is indeed a debut
novel. But that does not
detract from the impor-
tant themes it considers;
Haddad has masterfully
handled many crucial
and difficult topics.
Rasa’s grandmother is the
epitome of a domineering
Arab matriarch, so faith-
fully depicted, especially
through her speeches,
which made me laugh to
the point of tears at times.
In my opinion, it is high
time that we have an open,
transparent dialogue of
homosexuality in the Arab
world. We all know or
have heard of a gay Arab
person, but steadfastly
refuse to confront it and
have a serious conversa-
tion about it. Some are
strongly opposed to it, due
to religious and cultural
reasons, while others
tolerate it as long as it is

societal expectations

“He deftly

kept out of their sight.
Although countries like
Bahrain and Jordan have
not criminalised homo-
sexuality, LGBTQ indi-
viduals still face discrim-
ination if they outwardly
display their sexuality.
The majority of the Gulf
States have prison terms
“Haddad has
masterfully
handled so
many crucial
and difficult
themes”
for male homosexuality,
and it is punishable by
death in Saudi Arabia and
Iraq. I believe these views
are slowly, but surely,
evolving.
My visit to Liverpool
in summer coincided with
Pride. I was transfixed
by the intense energy the
participants brought to the
city, through the music of
the marching bands, the
choreographed dances,
and the sheer number of
participants. I saw people
bearing flags from various
Middle Eastern countries
including Iran, Kuwait,
and Oman. There were
a few protestors voicing
their discontent, but that
hardly affected the festi-
val’s atmosphere.
Considering the more
progressive views of the
younger generations, a
discussion on treatment
of LGBTQ Arabs needs
to be had; hopefully, this
novel will encourage it.
