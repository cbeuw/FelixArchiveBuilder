Andy’s most anticipated hip-hop albums of 2018
10
Drake
Drake ended ‘Do Not-
Disturb’, the final track
of More Life, his 2017
‘playlist’, by promising
fans: “I’ll be back in 2018
to give you the summary
More Life”. 2017 may
be remembered as the
year that Drake finally
relinquished his stran-
glehold over hip-hop. It
was the year that he saw
his phenomenal eight-
year Billboard Hot 100
Streak finally come to
an end - prior to August
2017, Drake had had a
song in the charts every
week since May 2009 - .
The lukewarm reception
to More Life suggests
that Drake’s days of
dominating the charts
are behind him, and it is
becoming apparent that
Drake is slowly passing
his peak. This could
perhaps explain this
period of unusual silence
from him - since featuring
on Metro Boomin’s ‘No
Complaints’ in June,
Drake has only appeared
on one song - . Drake’s
next album is, therefore,
all the more important;:
will he be able to drop
a classic to reclaim the
throne of hip-hop and cast
his legacy beyond doubt?

Isaiah Rashad
TDE ran 2017 with
both the best hip-hop
and R&B albums of the
year (Kendrick Lamar’s
DAMN. and SZA’s CTRL,
respectively). Naturally,
I’m excited to see what all
the artists from the label
have in store for us in
2018 but I’m particularly
excited to hear from Isaiah
Rashad whose debut
album, The Sun’s Tirade,
was one of my favourite
albums from 2016.

Jay Rock
Continuing the TDE
trend, the label’s stalwart
artist, Jay Rock, has been
relatively quiet since his
impressive 2015 album,
90059.Hehasbeenteasing
the follow up album and
recently dropped the
Kendrick Lamar and Fu-
ture-assisted lead single,
‘King’s Dead’. Jay Rock

Travis Scott
Astroworld
Through his intense live
shows - the night show
is truly a one of a kind
experience -, Travis Scott
has garnered a crazed fan
base and, despite teasing
these fans for over a year,
it appears that we are
no closer to any official
announcements regarding
the release of his third
album, Astroworld. In
December, he surprised
fans with his long-awaited
collaborative album with
Quavo, Huncho Jack,
Jack Huncho. However
,it was disappointing and
surprisingly lacked chem-
istry. Travis is still one
of the most creative and
influential artists in the
culture so I can’t wait to
hear what he does with his
upcoming solo material.
6
A$AP Rocky
Although he appeared
on multiple features in
2017, including A$AP
Mob’s collaboration Cozy
Tapes, Vol. 2: Too Cozy,
the lack of solo material
from A$AP Rocky, the
leader of the Mob, is bor-
dering on the ridiculous
now. He has left fans
completely in the dark,
with little more than the
promise of ‘experimental
sounds’ and a few Insta-
gram snippets from the
album to go by. For A$AP,
music has seemingly taken
a backseat to his other
interests high-fashion and
acting. It will be interest-
ing to hear if he can reach
the heights of his stellar
previous albums.

Post Malone
Beerbongs &
Bentleys
Post Malone’s debut
album, Stoney, which
was released in December
2016, unfortunately flew
under the radar. This was
perhaps due to a lack of
promotion or the fact
that it dropped on the
same day as J.Cole’s 4
Your Eyez Only. With
‘rockstar’, his 21 Savage
assisted tune, dominating
the charts and breaking
the record for the longest
time spent at number one
on Spotify, Post has dis-
proved all the haters that
were convinced he would
be a one-hit wonder after
his breakout single ‘White
Iverson’. His eclectic style
is apparent throughout all
his projects; I’m excited
to hear how he crafts this
upcoming release.
4
Chance The
Rapper
Chance The Rapper
dominated 2016 and has
since held the position of
hip-hop’s golden child.
He deservedly won
three awards at the 2017
Grammys and he could
seemingly do no wrong.
However, the murmurs
of discontent have been
bubbling under the surface
in the culture and Chance
has found himself having
to deny rumours of being
an ‘industry plant’ and
defend his claims of being
independent. Chance has
the potential to grab the
hip-hop throne therefore
it makes his follow up to
Coloring Book even more
crucial.

Kanye West
Turbo Grafx 16
We still haven’t
heard from Kanye West
since the cancellation
of the remainder of his
Saint Pablo tour and his
well-documented mental
breakdown, following
his wife, Kim Kardashi-

With TDE’s bench ready to drop and a possible new Queen of rap, here’s what we’re looking forward to in 2018

Pandering to the collective

Nicki Minaj
Nicki Minaj is at a
pivotal point in her career.
Outside of her core fans
(or ‘Barbz’), the wider
hip-hop community
seems to have had enough
of her dominance in rap.
She hasn’t dropped an
album since 2014’s The
Pinkprint and Remy Ma
successfully won their
beef in February. Nicki’s
lacklustre response to
Remy left her position as
the Queen of rap looking
extremely fragile. Despite
killing several features
this year (‘MotorSport’
and ‘Rake It Up’ come to
mind), Nicki’s solo efforts
have completely missed
the mark. Fans are tired of
hearing her repeat her fa-
vourite bar, “these bitches
is my sons”, and even
drawing for the Drake plus
Lil Wayne combo feature
(or the Young Money care
package) couldn’t stop her
single, ‘No Frauds’, from
flopping. The meteoric
rise of Cardi B’s rap
career in the last year is
further cause for Nicki
to be concerned. In order
for her to cement her
position as the Queen of
rap, it is imperative that
Nicki delivers with this
upcoming album.

Cardi B
In two years, Cardi
B has transitioned from
stripper to reality TV star
to the first female rapper
to claim the top spot on
the Hot 100 chart since
Lauryn Hill in 1998.
Cardi has taken the music
industry by storm and her
hilarious social media
antics have endeared
her to fans across the
world. The success of her
breakout single, ‘Bodak
Yellow’, naturally led to
the inevitable question
of whether she would be
able to follow it up. She
answered this question by
becoming the first female
rapper to simultaneously
land her first three entries
in the top ten of the Hot
100 (‘Bodak Yellow’,
‘MotorSport’ and ‘No
Limit’). Cardi first an-
nounced that her debut
album would be released
last October but, with
her buzz still growing at
feverish pace, she took
the wise decision to delay
its relase. 2018 is the
time for Cardi to drop her
major label debut album.
I’m intrigued to hear what
a Cardi B album sounds
like and to see how she
handles the pressure and
weight of expectation
on her shoulders. Due to
the unfortunate reality
of misogyny in hip-hop,
Cardi B’s music has
been directly compared
to Nicki Minaj’s and the
industry has effectively
manufactured a feud
between these women.
Although this Cardi
album will be a clear
indication of whether she
can succeed Nicki as the
resident Queen of hip-hop,
it is important for hip-hop
fans and general lovers of
the culture to remember
that these artists should
be celebrated in their own
right. Despite the fact
that the supposed female
rap beef is entertaining
and adds drama to the
situation, pitting these
artists against each other
is something we should
condemn as society.
P
anda Bear, born
Noah Lennox,
has become a
prevalent figure
within the indie music
community. A purveyor
of genres, Lennox and his
artistic counterpart Avey
Tare (Michael Portner)
have created some of the
wildest and most original
compositions from the
mysterious space they
seem to occupy in the
music world. Animal
Collective’s work,
before and including
Merriweather Post
Pavilion, have been her-
alded as masterful works
of experimental pop and
folk music.
But somewhere
somehow, Lennox’s
solo work started to
overshadow Animal Col-
lective’s output. Well, not
somehow. Person Pitch
was released in 2007. The
single greatest Animal
Collective record was a
hazy, anti-social and weird
Panda Bear solo LP. Like
Loveless is to shoegaze,
Person Pitch, undeniably
Lennox’s magnum opus,
would later become the
defining psych-pop record
of the 21st Century thus
far.
Lennox continued by
putting out two good,
verging on great, albums.
Then, out of absolutely
nowhere, he dropped A
Day with The Homies, a
29-minute EP, just a week
ago today. With this, and
a sudden increase in social
media activity, Lennox is
essentially drafting up
buzz, for what might be
his 5th solo LP.
With that in mind,
Homies could possibly be
a bunch of outtakes from
the forthcoming album, or
perhaps not. Regardless,
the tracks hold up on their
own. While generally
disconnected thematical-
ly, sonically everything
blends into one, as is
trademark of an Animal
Collective member.
Every track sways back
and forth, warped and
wrapped by sounds from
nature and bizarre sonic
textures. Lennox’s best
Brian Wilson impression
comes through again,
like ever, transforming
the obfuscated hazy pro-
duction into something
ethereal. Choir boy vocals
ran through an SP-404
delay makes for a dreamy
soundscape in which you
can easily lose yourself.
In my personal copy
of Person Pitch, the inner
booklet lists a bunch of
artists who have directly
influenced Lennox’s
work. It is perhaps
strange that Lennox, who
dabbles in all forms of
psychedelic music, would
be so heavily inspired by
techno musicians such as
Wolfgang Voigt and Deep
House architect Luomo
amongst many others.
Then again perhaps it
isn’t. The majority of
Lennox’s work has had a
prevalent ‘driving force’
behind it, reminiscent
of common techno beat
patterns.
Homies is however,
very upfront about this,
with a bouncy kick drum
and a buzzy bass on
opener ‘Flight’, continu-
ing the ‘Mr. Sonic Boom’
sounds off of Lennox’s
previous solo effort
Panda Bear Meets the
Grim Reaper. Despite all
the highs of this album,
dreamy soundscapes can
only do so much. Struc-
turally it is inherently
deficient, in the sense that
is only an EP. That said,
Animal collective have
had standout EP’s such
as Fall Be Kind. Though
Lennox’s current shtick,
the ‘busy for the sake
of being busy’ sound, is
occasionally annoying
here; he still this manages
to make it a more memo-
rable experience than one
of the last two Animal
Collective albums.
On Homies, Lennox es-
sentially gives us a taste of
the upcoming album. Yet,
it stands rather well on its
own. Whatever Noah has
been brewing over the last
couple of years, I want it.

A DAY WITH THE
HOMIES
is criminally underrated
but, after revealing in an
interview with REAL 92.3
LA that the upcoming LP
will be released through
both TDE and Interscope,
the additional major label
backing may prove to
propel this album and
give Jay Rock the respect
he deserves.
at gunpoint in Paris.
However, Kanye’s legacy
affords him the luxury of
always making the list of
most anticipated hip-hop
albums for any given year.
Kanye first announced
Turbo Grafx 16 in one
of his infamous Twitter
rants, shortly after his last
release, The Life of Pablo
in February 2016. Almost
two years later, and there
has still been no indica-
tion of what this album
will sound like or what we
should expect. Fans can at
least look forward to an
explosive response to Jay
Z, with whom Kanye has
an ongoing feud and who
mentioned him on ‘Kill
Jay Z’, the intro track
from 4:44.
