prominence”
Pressing buttons: How eSports turned into a worldwide
This month Imperial will be hosting the second eSports
varsity against UCL. It’s just one aspect of the booming
eSports industry, which has begun to take hold in the
UK over the last few years. With prize pools of millions
of dollars, and legions of fans across the globe, eSports
are bigger than ever, but where did they come from?
And what can we expect in the years to come?

A
group of in-
dividuals zip
around like pin-
balls, moving at
too high a speed to keep
track; one team, previ-
ously on the offensive,
are now in trouble, under
heavy attack from their
opponents, who have
bounced back with an
increased vitality. The au-
dience hold their breath,
chants falling silent, as
commentators provide a
blow-by-blow account of
what is going on in front
of them. And then it’s all
over. The crowd goes wild
as the winning team erupt
in celebration, triumphant
in their victory.
The event is not a
football match, or an NFL
final, but last year’s itera-
tion of ‘The International’,
the annual Dota 2 cham-
pionships – one of the
largest eSports events in
the world. Similar scenes
– in intensity if not in size
– are hoped for at Imperial
College Union next
Saturday, as IC eSports
prepare to host the second
annual Varsity between
Imperial and UCL. Up
to 200 participants and
spectators will come
together to play games
like League of Legends,
Dota, and Starcraft 2,
while many more will
follow along online with a
stream hosted on Twitch.
Imperial, who won last
year, are looking to defend
their title, hoping to hold
aloft the trophy at the end
of the day, while winning
teams will be taking home
laser-engraved plaques.
“This year is essentially
bigger in every way,”
Liam Couch, secretary
of ICU’s eSports society
tells me, with a bigger
audience, more awards,
and increased sponsor-
ship.
eSports – professional
competitive gaming,
mainly featuring Mul-
tiplayer Online Battle
Arena (MOBA) games,
such as Dota 2 – seems
like something that you
might see in a science-fic-
tion vision of the future.
But its pedigree is longer
than you might realise,
with the earliest competi-
Over the next couple of
decades, players largely
focused on setting high
scores in arcade games
like Pac-Man or Donkey
Kong, gaining publicity
from organisations like
the Guinness Book of
World Records. But it
wasn’t until the 1990s that
eSports really took off.
And it wasn’t in America
– it was in South Korea.
By the end of 1997,
East Asia was in the
gripe of a financial crisis.
The collapse of the Thai
economy due to the in-
creasing burden of foreign
debt caused multiple
countries to topple like
dominos. Over a period
of two weeks, Moody’s
lowered South Korea’s
credit rating from A1 to
B2, and a series of one-day
slumps led to mass unem-
ployment: over a year, the
number of unemployed
citizens nearly trebled, to
around 1.5 million.
It was against this
context that the eSports
phenomenon blossomed.
Some have argued that
there were three crucial
factors: a government that
increasingly funnelled
money into telecommu-
nications and internet
infrastructure; the rise
in popularity of LAN
gaming centres called PC
Bangs; and high unem-
ployment rates, which left
many Koreans with much
more disposable time.
Since then, eSports
have taken off at a phe-
nomenal rate: in 2000,

tion taking place decades
before most of today’s
eSports superstars were
even born. In October
1972, an announcement
was placed on bulletin
boards across Stanford
University, advertising
“The first ‘intergalactic
spacewar olympics’”:
the prize was a year’s
subscription to Rolling
Stone, and the event was
photographed by Annie
Leibovitz – then a 23 year
old staff photographer,
years before her rise to
fame. ‘Free beer!’ was
promised.
Compared to current
tournaments, this was a
much more sedate affair:
five players competed in a
single room at Spacewar!,
a 1962 game popular
among the programming
community. The premise
was simple: two ships
– the “needle” and the
“wedge” – fight against
the gravitational pull of a
central star, whilst trying
to shoot the other down,
all representing in glowing
green outlines. Those
involved didn’t know it,
but they were involved in
the first iteration of what
is now a multi-million
dollar industry: one small
step for gamers, one giant
leap for eSports.
Association (KeSPA)
was founded, coming
under the authority of the
government’s Ministry
of Culture, Sports and
Tourism. As well as
organising tournaments,
part of KeSPA’s remit is
to establish basic welfare
principles for those taking
part at a professional level:
companies are required to
have a one-year minimum
contract with players,

“Last year,
nearly 4,000

“eSports

currently
working on
competing
with American
universities”
while PC bangs require
children under 18 to leave
by 10pm. It’s part and
parcel of eSports increas-
ing cultural presence. As
Liam tell me: “eSports
have been growing in
popularity for a number
of years now, with people
able to compete against
friends and develop them-
selves as professionals,
which was previously not
possible.”
nearly 4,000 tournaments,
shelling out $111 million
to top players.
Writing for The Verge,
Ben Popper identifies
the release of Starcraft
II in 2010 as a key
turning point: the game,
a science-fiction real
time strategy game in
which you play as one of
three main species, “was
embraced by a global
community of rabid fans
who had been playing its
predecessor for more than
a decade.”
But while eSports
remains largely centred
around the Korean market,
it is beginning to move to
the UK too – the British
eSports Association was
established in 2016, while
events like Varsity high-
light their prominence.
Speaking to Liam, he
tells me: “the increasing
popularity and profile of
our Varsity reflects an
increasing desire to watch
competitive eSports. The
fact we’re hosting an
event similar to traditional
sporting events shows
how mainstream this is
becoming”. Even the
name was a deliberate
choice, as Roy Lee, ICU
eSports’ chair tell me:
“instead of calling this
an eSports competition,
we’ve chosen to call it an
eSports Varsity, to break
the negative perceptions
around eSports, and show
the public the similarities
between eSports and
traditional sports in uni-
versities”.
Will they ever be
as popular as in Korea
though? While Liam
admits that “the culture
is entirely different in
South Korea… this is
why they’re miles better
than everyone else,” Roy
feels that the next few
years will be vital for
eSports in the UK: “We
are seeing strong and
accelerated movements
in the States due to heavy,
focused investments
towards students,” he
tells me, “what we can
do as an eSports society
in the coming years will
determine whether uni-
versity eSports in the UK
can keep up with these
countries in terms of its
standards and quality.
Competitions between
universities shouldn’t be
limited to within London,
or even within the UK. We
should look to compete
globally.” The society
is currently working on
plans to compete with
American universities in
the near future.
The debate about
whether eSports should
be counted as ‘real’
sports is ongoing; those
who defend eSports
would point out the quick
reaction times and agile
minds needed by those
who ascend to the top of
the leagues, arguing that
such skills are similar to
those required in a number
of professional sports. But
the safest argument may
be in audience numbers:
the 2014 League of
Legends championship,
for example, saw 40,000
fans pack into the same
arena South Korea used
for the 2002 World Cup
semi final; in the States,
the first eSports arena has
been launched in Santa
Ana, California, while
later this year the first
eSports Arena on the Las
Vegas strip is set to open
its doors. Viewership of
the tournaments has also
exploded, thanks to plat-
forms like Twitch, which
was bought by Amazon
in 2014 for $1 billion.
In 2013, the League of
Legends world champi-
onship had 32 million
people across the globe
watching; last year’s NBA
finals had an audience of
only 20 million.
It seems likely that,
should the growth cur-
rently enjoyed by the
eSports industry continue,
it may leapfrog a number
of other traditional sports.
“It’s important to note that
eSports are achieving a
number of participants
and viewers it took tradi-
tional sports decades or
centuries to achieve,” Roy
tells me, “I am certain
that eSports will be part
of university culture very
soon.” eSports are also
challenging traditional
assumptions about what
gaming and gamers look
like: “gamers still find
themselves defending
their passion for eSports,”
Roy tells me, “they are
immediately associated
with the stereotype of
anti-social nerds in their
parents’ basement.”
The atmosphere at the
tournaments show that
this couldn’t be further
from the truth: thousands
of people go along to
cheer their favourite teams
along, coming together
for a brief moment in
celebration of teamwork
and strategy. “eSports
bring people together,”
argues Liam, “they partic-
ipate in something bigger,
experiencing it as a group,
in much the same way
other sports and hobbies
do. eSports give people
an avenue to do what
they love whilst sharing
that with other people.”
Looking at videos of these
tournaments, and you’d be
hard pressed to disagree:
while the players are
locked in a battle of wills
with their screens, their
faces masks of steely de-
termination, around them
there’s a legion of fans,
who have come together,
and are eagerly looking
on.
Imperial College
Union’s eSports Society
will be hosting their
Varsity against UCL on
Saturday 27th
January,
from 10am, in the Union
Concert Hall. All day
tickets are available from
the Union website – £4 for
players and members; £5
for everyone else.
eSports tournaments have swelled to massive sizes over the years // Wikimedia
It makes sense for gov-
ernments to get in on the
eSports action – games
are big business. While
a number of critics still
question whether video
games are true works
of art, their popularity
is manifestly evident in
the economic figures:
last year, the video game
industry made $109
billion in revenue. To put
that number into context,
the global box office
for films last year was a
mere $41.2 billion, while
worldwide art sales came
in at $45 billion
And this is a market
that shows no sign of
slowing down: last year
the industry grew 7.8%,
and is expected to expand
massively on smartphone
platforms. eSports has
the potential to increase
this growth even further,
as tournaments with
eye-wateringly high prize
pools proliferate. In 2000,
there were 50 eSports
tournaments worldwide,
with a total prize pool of
$675,000; by last year
this had ballooned to
gaming phenomenon
