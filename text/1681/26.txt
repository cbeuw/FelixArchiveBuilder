mperial College
Union announced
their Summer Ball
theme for this year:
‘Feudalism’.
An email was sent
out to all students earlier
this week, inviting them
to “experience life as a
medieval peasant, so dust
off that hennin, and rock it
like it’s 1249”. The invita-
tion encouraged students
to come to the Ball in full
costume, offering ideas
like “battered soldier re-
turning from the Crusades
with a mysterious vene-
real disease”, “emaciated
serf living hand to mouth
while your liege grows
richer”, and “pox-ridden
English milkmaid”.
ICU continued the
theme with the ticketing
system, which saw three
distinct packages on offer:
the ‘Nobility’ tickets sold
out in a mere 19 minutes.
These tickets included
benefits like the ability to
choose the spouses of stu-
dents who had opted for
cheaper tickets, vast tracts
of fertile countryside, and
three free drinks tokens.
The majority of students,
however, will have to
make do with the cheaper
‘fief’ ticket, which will
not offer protection from
the Black Death, and only
come with a single drinks
token, which must be used
“we thought long and hard
about the theme for the
Summer Ball this year.
Initially we were debating
between themes like
‘Roaring 20s’, ‘Carnival’,
and ‘Hawaiian Luau’, but
the suggestion of medie-
val feudalism came in at
the last minute, and we
all recognised its unique
potential. We thought that
after a long, difficult year
of studying, and numer-
ous rejected applications
to FinTech internships,
students would really
appreciate a night where
their position in society is
completely fixed, and all
they have to worry about
is a lack of basic medicine
or sanitation.”
Reaction from students
was mixed. Alice, a third-
year biology student, told
Felix that she thought the
choice was “interesting”,
but was concerned about
historical accuracy: “the
last themed party I went

my wimple wasn’t from
a 13th
-century design.”
Other students were more
receptive: “I spent most of
my teenage years inside
alone playing Medieval
II: Total War. Sometimes
I would wonder whether
I wouldn’t be better off
going outside and making
friends, but now all my
experience will totally
pay off. I’ll be able to spot
an inaccurate wimple at
100-yards.”
Felix does not know
how many tickets the
Union has sold thus far,
but they will be looking
to beat the record for
most popular Summer
Ball ever, which was set
during the 2014 Summer
Ball, whose theme ‘Lower
Back Pain’ was a surprise
hit.
“ICU offered
costume ideas,
such as‘pox-
ridden English
milkmaid’and
‘emaciated
serf’”
for the Union’s remaining
stores of Bud Light.
A Union representative
spoke to Felix about the
development of the plans:
“One student

playing

Total War had

An email was sent out
this week to all physics
students expressing
concern over how
unfunny all their jokes
were.

Editor-in-Chief
P
hysics under-
graduates were
this week sent a
mass email from
departmental staff, ask-
ing them to have better
chat.
The email, which
was sent out late this
Wednesday evening, was
co-signed by a number
of senior staff within the
Department of Physics
and the Faculty of Natural
Sciences. With the subject
heading “We Need to
Talk About Your Shit
Chat”, the email gave
several examples of what
the authors described as
“impossibly unfunny chat
between students in the
department.”
The message, whose
recipients are believed
to number around 1,500
students, offered a “gentle
reminder” to students
of departmental policy:
“you are a representative
of Imperial’s Department
of Physics, and – as
such – we expect you to
refrain from homophobia,
sexism, or laughing at
your own cringe jokes
about quantum superpo-
sition.” They reminded
students: “if you can’t say
anything funny, don’t say
anything at all.”
Felix spoke to the new-
ly-appointed Vice-Provost
(Chat Adjudicator), Oscar
Wapping, who said that
the “shit chat problem”
had reached “epidemic
proportions”: “Imperial is
currently a world-leading
centre for globally-rec-
ognised research, but
unfortunately our students
are lagging behind when
it comes to saying things
that are actually funny or
interesting.”
College have begun an
internal review to examine
where improvements
can be made, and will be
offering new Horizons
courses in comedy from
October 2018. The course,
which will be taught by
a visiting lecturer from
UCL, will include lectures
like “If you make a joke in
the forest, and nobody is
there to laugh, it’s because
you’ve got no friends”
and “When banter isn’t
banter: a linguistic de-
construction of humour”.
A representative from the
College told Felix: “we
have high hopes for this
new course, which should
help improve Imperial’s
standing nationally, since,
let’s be honest, our chat is
weak af.”
