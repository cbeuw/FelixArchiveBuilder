Welcome
Welcome to Imperial
College. If you're a new
student, you're probably
feeling a little
apprehensive. Don't worry.
Many of the students that
you see today are in the
same position as you. As
soon as you get to know a
few of them life will seem a
lot better. Don't be afraid of
talking to somebody you
don't know. They will be
looking for new friends as
well. Go to the introductory
events of as many clubs as
you can. Even if you don't
continue as an active
member when academic
work starts, you'll have
made friends by joining in.
Go to all the parties. Don't
worry about making a fool
of yourself by joining in.
Next week you will have to
start work. Don't be stupid
and fail your exams by not
doing any work. Make sure,
though, that you don't get
so wrapped up in work that
you find you haven't got a
social life.
I apologise for giving you
all this advice that may
sound very patronising. I
know people have been
telling you the do's and
don'ts of University life for
weeks. Enjoy Freshers'
Week and forget all your
mother's instructions about
phoning every day and
getting to bed before
eleven.
Welcome back and have
a good year if you're not a
new student.
FELIX
FELIX is the best student
newspaper in the country.
It is fortunate in being free
of Union control. This
means that it can and does
criticise IC Union as well as
the College. FELIX has
some of the best facilities
in the country. However it
needs your help if these
facilities are to be fully
utilised. So, come and work
on FELIX. It doesn't matter
if you haven't any
experience. It's your
enthusiasm that counts.
If you're a second or
third year, you may have
noticed that FELIX has
changed a little during the
summer. If you have any
view on the changes write
to me in the FELIX Office.
The copy deadline for
letters, small ads and
what's on is 1.00pm
Monday.
IC Union
As a student at Imperial
College you are
automatically a member of
IC Union. IC Union
represents you and spends
# [ di i o f i a
over £250,000 of your
money. IC Union is
important. If you read the
letters column you'll find a
letter complaining that the
Union is cliquey and
intimidating. It also
complains of the childish
behaviour of Union officers.
Both of these criticism are
fair. This criticisms though,
is not because Union
officers are different! It is
because few people
attempt to take part in the
government of the Union.
On Thursday there is a
Union General Meeting.
This is the one opportunity
ordinary students have to
question their
representatives. If College
are thinking about
increasing your rent they
don't talk to you, they ask
the Union what you think.
The only way the Union
can consult you is by
holding General Meetings.
If you don't go, Union
policy will be formulated by
the same cliquey group
who always formulate U G M
policy. It is pathetic
complaining about IC
Union if you don't make
some attempt to change it.
by going to UGMs.
Rag Mag
At the U G M on Thursday
you will have the
opportunity to decide
whether you want to be
able to buy a Rag Mag that
in places is very funny or
whether you want to
improve the reputation of
Imperial College. Other
colleges believe that IC is
full of racist, sexist piss-
artists. This stops people
coming to Imperial. The
Rag Mag contains racist
jokes. If you want to
improve the image of
Imperial, support the
Executive. If you want to be
known as a racist, vote for
the ban to be lifted.
Casual Labour
College employs a large
number of casual workers
in the bars, Summer
Accommodation Centre
etc. In the last few weeks
there have been several
complaints that students
have been discouraged
from taking these jobs.
College has a duty to help
students find jobs. Many
students can only survive
by finding casual jobs. If
College doesn't give
students preferential
treatment when taking on
ccasual workers it is failing
in its duty to look after
students.
Bar Prices
College Bars are meant to
provide a service for
students. They aren't meant
to make the £30,000 profit
they make each year. They
aren't meant to subsidise
the refectories. Last week I
went into the Union Bar
one lunchtime. Outside
there were fifteen or twenty
students protesting. The
bar was full of workmen,
many of whom weren't
College employees. The
only students were those
working behind the bar. At
the next U G M get Carl
Burgess to protest to
College about the bar price
rises and get him to
organise a boycott if
College don't do
something.
Sabbaticals
The Executive have failed
in their duties this summer.
They were right to ban the
Rag Mag but they should
have banned it before it
went to the printers. Their
job description requires
them to check the artwork.
They didn't do this and the
Union has lost £1500 as a
result.
Rob Northey has
introduced plans that could
wreck the bars. His staff
won't work for him if he
asks them to give national
insurance numbers.
Students won't go in the
bars because they know
that the price rises are over
the top. Instead of
campaigning against the
changes the Union
sabbaticals agreed to the
rises. The sabbaticals
wasted an opportunity to
do something for students.
Ask at the U G M what the
Union sabbaticals have
done this summer.
Cover
This week's FELIX cover
has been criticised. It is
claimed that it gives the
wrong impression. While it
is a little over the top, there
are people who try and
chat up any woman they
see. Don't let this put you
off going to the Freshers'
events. You can always tell
them to get lost.
ICU Handbook
If you haven't got your
copy yet then go and get
one from IC Union office. It
is excellant. Nigel Atkinson
has done a thoroughly
professional job. The
complaints about the cover
are crap. It was there to
give the Handbook impact.
It succeeded. Inside the
cover Nigel explains that
Carl Burgess was raising
money for charity when he
iad his hair shaved.
...but were afraid to
ask
Make sure that you take a
copy and keep it. This is an
excellant guide to all those
things your mother forgot
to tell you about. You may
never need to refer to it. It's
better, though, to have it
there just in case.
Tickets
FELIX has twenty free
tickets for tomorrow's Hip
Parade at the Camden
Palace. Two tickets will be
given to the first ten people
to come into the FELIX
Office and ask for them.
Athletics
My apologies for not
keeping my promise to
Athletics and Cross County
Club by not putting their
full name on the Freshers'
Fair plan. If you are
interested in competing at
athletics for Imperial, go
and visit the Cross Country
stall at Freshers' Fair.
