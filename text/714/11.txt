he Belt
It seems that gambling
tendancies are not
restncted to the IC Union
Office, where the
Wednesday afternoon
racing is now a regular
feature. A group of
mechanical engineers are
running a sweepstake on
the date ICU President,
Carl Burgess, either resigns
or is booted out of office.
In view of the yet-to-be-
explained Rag Mag
banning, Below The Belt
suspects those who chose
dates in the Autumn term
have the best chance of
winning the not
insubstantial prize.
However, it remains to be
seen if Dave 'Not So Rave'
Kingston is to pip Carl at
the post. Dithering Dave
was clear favourite to be
the first to go but Carl's
sudden sprint before the
start of term means that the
race is wide open. Get
those bets on soon.
Rag Mag bannings are
now a traditional start to
every year but even the
most hardened observors
have been surprised by
Carl Burgess' sudden
concern for good taste and
the sanctity of IC Union's
reputation. For the 1983
Rag Mag, editor C Burgess,
was widely criticised as
being tasteless, sexist,
racist etc. Angry ietters and
unfavourable coverage in
the national press ensued
successful Rag Mag selling
trips. But for Carl it was not
tasteless enough! The
Union Executive of the day
wisely removed a number
of the more extreme 'jokes'.
However, Carl was so upset
that he had all the banned
jokes reprinted in a copy of
FELIX with paragraphs of
explanation from him as to
their merit.
One of Mr Burgess' more
recent ideas was to have a
bonfire with the 2000
copies of the new Rag Mag
which have been delivered.
Perhaps any remaining
copies of his offering could
also join any raging
inferno. It might help dilute
the smell of hypocrisy
currently floating around.
Carl's dislike for the
editor of the offending Rag
Mag, Tony Spencer, knows
no bounds. At a recent
party in Shepherds Bush
attended by a mass of
Union notables, Carl found
himself needing to relieve
himself. As ever on such
occasions, Carl found the
toilet engaged so adopted
the novel tactic of urinating
over someone's jacket. In
his drunken stupor, Cari
must not have realised that
the jacket belonged to one
Tony Spencer. The
residents of the flat must
have taken a crumb of
comfort that he left the
carpet alone; the carpet in
the room in Southside
which Carl occupied last
year has now been
replaced.
At the end of last term,
the announcement
regarding the new Rector
was made at a meeting of
the Governing Body, which
is followed by a lunch
attended by assorted Union
hacks and the College's
Governors. While everyone
was happily diving into the
salmon and strawberries
the FELIX Editor—elect was
busy hopping around 170
trying to arrange an
interview with Professor
Ash. An early morning chat W/gm
was promptly arranged for | H
the next week. That
evening the College
Secretary, John Smith,
hearing of the gyrating Mr
Southey's early rise felt
obliged to comment that
'anyone who can get the
FELIX editor out of bed at
7.00am in the morning
must be able to sort out
College Administration.'.
The male:female ratio at
IC is quite sufficient to limit
extra-curricular activity
(screwing) but, not
satisfied, members of
Hercule Reeves Security
Service have decided to
discourage those who do
indulge. Patrolling the halls
of residence, ears pricked
for the faintest mutterings
of a passionate nature, one
security guard was in the
habit of banging loudly on
the offending couples door
and mumbling "ere, that
should upset his rhythm'.
Residents will be relieved
to hear that they will be no
recurrence of this practise
in the near future. However,
those involved in late night
discussions of a Ugandan
nature in the Sherfield
building may not be so
lucky.
