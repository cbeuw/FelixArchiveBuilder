Rector's Reception
Dear Sir
I remember my first
Union General Meeting. I
took my seat amongst the
other thousand freshers,
eager to hear what Gaynor
Lewis, then ICU President,
had to say about life in
Imperial College as a
student, how ICU was
going to help me spend the
next three years, and make
my grant last for the
duration.
After the official greeting
from the Rector, it was the
Union's turn. I was sadly
disappointed as we were
subjected to a few very
cliquey jokes which sent a
few older Union hacks into
bouts of laughter and left
me and all of the other
freshers bored and
mystified. This was
followed by Mines
attacking most people with
flower, water and whatever
else came to hand.
Needless to say many,
including myself, were put
right off the Union in less
than an hour.
Now having seen this
years I.C.U.Handbook we
are confronted by a half
naked Carl Burgess with no
hair, covered in shaving
foam. Inside the Handbook
is very good but look at the
first impression it gives to
students before they get to
college, and think what it
does for their parents who
probably don't read inside.
This is not some sort of
zoo, and I really think that
the union ought to get its
act together with regards to
its image. ICU has got
something to offer to
College life but whilst it
maintains an air of idiocy,
intelligent students will not
get involved. If it were to
use FELIX, probably the
best college newspaper in
the country, to improve this
image promoting some of
the best things in college -
maybe the large S C C
societies like Wellsoc and
Ind Soc - and then tidy up
on the quality of the
UGM's. a bit, making them
less outlandish, students
may even listen.
Yours faithfully

Physics 3
Squatters
Dear Editor,
I would like to draw your
attention, and that of
Hamlet Gardens residents,
to the situation in flat 140.
During the summer, these
flats are let to a members
of the public by college—in
Imperial
College
Union
Handbook
1985
This is your President
-What have you fet yourself in for?
reality this means
unemployed Irish-bastazds
youths who fancy an
indefinite holiday in
London.
Three of these, a Declan
Slevin, Robert Kane and
Philip Behan, who were
living in 140 instead of
moving out when they had
been told, and agreed to do
so in writing, and were
legally obliged to do so so
under Scheme 15 Part II
case 14 of the Rent Act
1977, decided that it would
be really cool to change
the lock, board up the front
door and call themselves
squatters.
Thanks to these 'free
spirits' who are 'fighting
back against the system'
(we get a lot of these at
Summer Lettings), six
genuinely needful students
have been deprived of a
flat.
So why can't college
move them out? Well, they
can, but it takes 6 weeks to
do so. Any attempts to
speed this process by
harrassment, violence or
threat, or kicking the door
in, pinning everyone in
sight to the ground and
throwing out all their
possessions (not the telly,
that's ours) by persons
acting on behalf of the
college is an offense.
However, ordinary students
who happen to be resident
in Hamlet would not be
acting on behalf of the
college...
I hope this letter will not
be misconstrued as an
incitement to cause any
kind of harrasment, as I am
merely pointing out the
facts. I would also like to
point out that I am no
longer an employee at
Hamlet Gardens, and
therefore my interest in the
matter is purely as a
student, in no connection
with college authority.
Yours Frustratedly,
Paul Bloomfield
Ex-Assistant Manager
Hamlet Gardens.
Rag Mag
Dear Sir,
Since ICU President Carl is
allowed to make a whole
page presentation of his
case, please let me put
forward Rag's case in this
humble way.
In the Opinion column,
Carl has stated that Rag
Mags do not produce
money as a prime aim, and
are aimed to outdo Steve
Marshall's production.
Where previous Rag
Mags were banned by
UGM's this decision has
always been overturned by
later UGM's, with the only
loser being Rag ie loss of
money donated to charities.
The adoption of clearer
rules for all IC publications
is a good idea, even though
brought about by the
incompetences of this
year's Exec.
With respect to the
alternative view, I would
like to make a few points.
Firstly, Freshers' will not
have seen the Rag Mag,
and very few students have
seen a copy of SM's (1980)
since they have been so
well selling that none are
left.
Last year, RCS started
Rag Tours around the
country selling old rag
mags. They were received
well, over 7,000 were sold
and over £2,000 profit
made, which went to Rag.
People liked out different
style.
Rag Committee decided
that a similar style ought to
be continued this year, and
have affirmed that it ought
to be sold in its present
form. Apart from the
ommission of the printers
name (his fault as it was
removed from the artwork
supplied), the ICU solicitor
says that we will have no
problems with the content.
Carl Burgess was editor of
our last Rag Mag, and even
London Student (not
known for its pro IC
stance) say that this years
is almost idential—except
less racist—than Carl's.
The Exec had ample
opportunity to censor (and
they did), but have
changed their minds after
the return of the Rag Mag
from the printers. This may
well result in the waste of
£1500 of Union money.
Lastly, as Editor, I have
made a great effort to
increase profitability for the
Rag Mag, by including
advertising and finding a
cheaper printer, so that the
cost per copy is almost
halved (22p—13p). I have
found advertisers who will
not advertise next year if
we do not sell these Rag
Mag's. In addition, even
potential purchasers will
miss out on the opportunity
of a free half pint of Firkin
beer at any Bruce's
Brewery pub.
To formulate your own
ideas, talk to Carl, to me (at
RCSU) and read FELIX Nos
709, 710, 712, and 713
(freely available in FELIX
Office) and ask to read, a
copy of this year's Rag Mag
and Carl's Rag Mag in ICU
(for information purposes)
before Thursday's U G M
and make up you own
mind.
