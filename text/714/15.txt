There is no easy way to get to know a new environment and
Fresher's Week, with all its bands, beer and backache is as good
as any.

On Wednesday morning, the blearly-eyed survivors stagger to
College for their first lecture. This momentous event is usually
delivered in Greek by someone with a speech impediment. By
the second lecture you have usually elected your academic rep.
In the Afternoon the super-fit/masochists queue for sports trials
at Harlington while mere mortals stagger to Sainsburys and then
catch up on some sleep to prepare for another fun packed
evening.
Thursday morning—a boringly familiar routine is already
established, but the real highlight is the lunchtime ICU UGM
(Union General Meeting). Occasionally, important issues are
discussed but they are never allowed to stop trivia dominating
the meeting. This year's traditional excitement is bound to be a
motion on the Rag Mag. The paper darts throwing also begins in
earnest.
More lectures and then Friday Night's Fresher's Ball with
entertainment into the not so early hours of the morning. Do not
get too tired and emotional, though, because Saturday brings
the biggest Rag stunt of the year: tiddleywinking down Oxford
and Regents Street. The three C C U s organise this back
breaking marathon which raises about £2000 for charity. You
should go to your respective C C U office by 9.00am on Saturday
if you want to take part. It is worth making an effort to get out of
bed, so you can feel smug as you chant outside the halls of
residence to wake up all of Southside
