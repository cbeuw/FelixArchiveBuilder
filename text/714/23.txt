Hugh Southey looks at
three Great American Movies.
Cocoon is a science
fiction-fantasy about some
old age pensioners who
discover the secret of
eternal youth. It is about a
charter-board skipper who
falls in love with an
extraterrestrial. It is about a
friendly group of aliens.
The press release claims
that 'together they embark
on a wondrous adventure
in which they all learn more
about love, life and
friendship than they ever
dreamed possible' That is
very pretencious and over
the top. Cocoon has no
deep messages about love,
life or anything else. It is
just an entertaining piece
of cinema. It makes you
laugh in some places and
moves you in other places.
Don Ameche, Wilford
Bramley and Hume Cronyn
are all excellent as the old
age pensioners who are
rejuvenated. This film is
worth going to see (even if
the few scenes that use
special effects are awful)
which is more than can be
said for Code Of Silence.
Code Of Silence is about a
Chicago policeman who
decides to take on
organised crime single
handed. It has a few good
stunts, but that is only
good thing that can be said
about it. If you can believe
that a policeman can take
on forty villains armed with
machine guns, then this is
your film. If you enjoy
seeing loads killed then this
is your film. If you like
something that is a little
deeper then I advise you to
see something else.
The Holcroft Covenant is
based on an interesting
Robert Ludlum story.
Unfortunately the acting,
script and directing ruins
the film. Most of the acting
is dire, and people were
laughing out loud during
the seduction scenes. This
film is one of those big
budgeted flops that are
really worth avoiding.
Whilst Code Of Silence is
aimed at people who enjoy
violent films, (and they will
probably think it was quite
good), I can't believe
anyone will enjoy The
Holcroft Covenant.
M o r e t e a r s f o r t h e R e d S e a .
'Living in peace with one
another' is a subject
perhaps best left alone
when dealing with the
Lebanon. But Beyond The
Walls, the latest foreign-
film offering from Gate
Cinema, Notting Hill,
throws caution to the wind,
propaganda to the people
to show that
Palestinian/Israeli unity can
exist, if only on the
comfortably distanced
silver screen.
Beyond The Walls uses the
tensions of an Israeli prison
in which to explore the
possibilities of such unity.
Both Arabic and Jewish
prisoners (many with
conflicting criminal
charges) are forced to live
together - a practice which
rarely occurs on the West
Bank; here the prison
governors stage drug
racketeering and riots in
order to fuel the racial
tensions between the two
races. It is in this climate
that the two leaders, Uri
(Arnon Zadok) and Issam
(Muhamad Bakri), establish
allegiance and strength to
confront their gaolers in a
hunger strike which
remains unresolved.
It is tragic to contrive such
fantasies in which to stage
this message of mutual
understanding, and,
however genuine the intent
of its Israeli makers, the
film is worthless in real
terms. As moralistic
propaganda, it is peculiarly
disturbing to see two sides,
bitterly opposed beyond
the walls, seek redress
against some other,
elevated mutual oppressor,
for there is no common
enemy in the Lebanon.
Would that this were a
British film, a French film
or an American film to raise
an independant voice
against the hostilities.
Admittedly, the film has a
host of European awards to
acclaim, including the
International Film Critic's
Prize and a literal armful of
Oscars. But these do little
to take away the film's
futility after the solemn
head-nodding and
congratultiono are over.
..books.
IN WATERMELON SUGAR
R. Brautigan
Yet another weirdo book
from Brautigan. I think he
must be trying to compete
with Hemingway for
peculiar prose style and
stupid concepts. A very
hirsute novel about 'gentle
people leading sleepy lives
in watermelon sugar', that
is, nothing at all. Worth a
chortle, but only to be
appreciated if you're on an
acid trip. It was probably
written during one.
(Picador, £1.95)
NOVEL WITH COCAINE
M. Ageyev
This rediscovered Russian
novel, by an anonymous
author, was written near
the time of the 1917
revolution. It is based
around an anti-hero, Valim,
a self-conscious and self-
humiliated adolescent who
becomes a cocaine addict,
and about his increasing
dependance on the drug,
so that faced with the death
of his mother, his only
reaction is to seek out
more of the narcotic. A
disturbing and profound
work. (Picador, £2.95)
M c C A R T H Y S LIST
Mary Mackey
A black comedy in which a
woman condemned to be
shot for the murder of an
old lady whom she did not
in fact kill, writes about her
life. It is difficult to tell
whether she is madder than
the world around her, and
her paranoia is reminiscent
of Kafka. Even the happy
(?) ending leaves me
wondering whether she is
free, or a ghost. This is a
remarkable book, definitely
worth missing lectures to
finish. (Picador £1.95)
THE ART OF EATING
M. F. K. Fisher
A 750 page tome which is a
comprehensive array of
feeding. Some parts, such
as the social status of the
vegetable, may be over-
elaborate and unnecessary,
but the chapters on 'How to
boil water', 'How not to boil
an egg' and 'How to cook
like a wolf are the types of
basic noshing we need.
The whole massive work is
as dotted with anecdotes as
a rich pate is with truffle
and makes light reading if
not light eating. An
excellent book. (Picador,
£4.95)
