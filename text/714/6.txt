I Exec Rag
Mag Fiasco
The 1985-86 Rag Mag
has been banned at a cost
of £1500 within hours of its
delivery. The Rag Mag was
in such bad taste it would
ruin the reputation, the
Executive decided. Guilds
President and Executive
Member, Roger Preece told
FELIX if we're not careful
Imperial will become more
renowned for it's obsenities
than it's excellence!
The Union sabbaticals
are given the power to edit
the Rag Mag and remove
any jokes that may be
offensive in it. Union
President, Carl Burgess,
was the only sabbatical to
read any of the completed
copy before it went to the
printers.
When the printers
delivered the Rag Mag the
sabbaticals realised their
mistake. Mr Burgess told
FELIX that the Rag Mag
was designed to shock
rather then amuse. He
describe it as 'shocking,
disgusting and appalling
rubbish'. He admitted that
he should have checked
the artwork before it went
to the printers.
Members of Rag
Committee are hoping to
overturn the ban at the
Freshers' UGM. Rag Mag
editor, Tony Spencer,
justified his decision to
print the jokes saying 'We
have to be able to laugh
things off and soldier on
with life'. Rag Chairman,
Jon Ingham, said he didn't
find the publication
offensive.
IC Smash UL
Imperial College,
represented by Kevin
Steinbeckner, Greg
Harding, Andrew Spalding
and Guy Pooley, won the
Visitors' Cup by beating the
University of London in the
final. The win was Imperial
College boat club's fiftieth
win this season.
Coach, Bill Mason
described the result as
tremendous. In his view the
win showed Imperial
College had one of the best
five boat clubs in Britain.
Imperial won at Henley in
1978.

Guardian S l a m s Rag
The IC Rag Mag was used
by the Guardian as an
example of racism in
British universities. A joke
from the 1981-82 Rag Mag
was used to start an article
which was a description of
'The pressures of being a
black woman studying in
the New Right's latest
recruiting ground: Britain's
university campuses.' The
article was by Chinyelu
Onwurah, a second year
undergraduate in Elecrical
Engineering.
Ms Onwurah told FELIX
that she could not speak
for the black community at
IC. In her view, though, the
atmosphere at IC was right
wing and hence hostile to
black people.
Rosemary
Marries
Rosemary Ivor-Jones, the
FELIX typesetter operator,
married John Hosking on
Saturday 3 August at St
Leonards Church, Hythe.
FELIX would like to
congratulate the couple
and wish them well for the
future.

ICU Slam
Indsoc
Industrial Society, Imperial
College Union's second
largest society, were
effectively thrown out of
the Union for two days
during the summer. The
decision was made by ICU
President, Carl Burgess
and ICU Deputy President,
Dave Kingston after it had
been revealed that
Industrial Society had not
closed two bank accounts
it holds.
Social Club Committee
standing orders state that
'Income from any source
must be payed to the
Senior Treasurer'. Industrial
Society were warned that
by paying money into their
own account they were
breaking these standing
orders. They were told if
they didn't close the
accounts the privileges
associate with being an
Imperial College Club
would be stopped. When
the Union received no
reply, Industrial Society
lost these priveleges.
Industrial Society have
now agreed to let the
Senior Treasurer control
these accounts and to have
the accounts audited.
