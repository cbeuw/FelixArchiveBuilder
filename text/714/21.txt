Although this article will
severely alter the style of
this publication, the Editor
has allowed me some
space to tell you a few
things that you might find
useful.
Crash Pad
If you haven't got
anywhere to live at the
moment there is a room set
aside in the Union Building
for you to stay until you
find accommodation. Just
bring a sleeping bag and
ask at the Union Office
which room it will be. It
won't cost a penny.
Registration, Grants,
Cheques and Union Cards
Before you can obtain
your grant cheque or Union
Card you have to register
for your course and obtain
a Registration Slip. No
Union Card or grant
cheque willl be issued
without one. Registration
will be occuring in the
Junior Common Room
(JCR) all day Monday 30
September and til 12.00am
on Tuesday 1 October.
After that time you will
have to Register in Room
343 Sherfield Building and
pick up your grant cheques
form the lift hall on level 3
Sherfield.
Union Cards will be
issued in the JCR until
12.00am Tuesday 1
October and then will be
switched to the Upper
Lounge in the Union
Building from 10.00am to
4.00pm in the first week. I
suggest that you obtain
one as soon as possible
otherwise you will be
denied access to the Union
Building for the Carnival on
Friday 4.
You will be issued with
two Union Cards, one for
IC and one for ULU,
therefore you will need two
photographs (black and
white or colour).
We are affiliated to the
World Univeristy Service,
an educational charity with
special concern for
academic freedom and
human rights within the
educational sphere. We are
privileged in that we are
able to perceive education
as a right, others are not so
fortunate. The WUS
enables people, who
otherwise would have no
opportunity to further their
education and to obtain the
financial backing to be able
to do so. To this end we
are holding a collection in
the JCR for the WUS and
we hope that you will give
generously.
UGM Thursday 1.00pm
Great Hall
The UGM is the
Sovereign Body of IC
Union. If the U G M tells me
to jump, I jump. It has the
power to question my
actions, tell me what to do
and even has the power to
sack me. As members of IC
Union you all have the right
to vote, to put forward
policy and question
decisions made. If you do
not do so you will have to
live with the policies made
by others on your behalf.
Even if you disagree with
those policies they will be
your policies whether you
like it or not. I can only
urge you to turn up and
exercise your democratic
right and not allow vocal
minorities to dictate the
policies of the Union.
On a lighter note Nicola
Rossi, the President of
University of London
Union, will be explaining
the role of ULU and what it
can offer the IC student. As
you are also members of
ULU it will provide a good
opportunity to find out
what a federal University is
all about.

Discourse
Dave Kingshn
Freshers' Fair
Is taking place tomorrow in
the both the Union and
Sherfield Buildings. Almost
all clubs and societies will
be there trying to persuade
yo uto join them. As a
result you can end up by
parting with loads of
money joining countless
clubs that you won't have
time to get involved in. To
this end, as in previous
years all clubs are
forbidden to take
membership fees from
anyone, (stall organisers
please note as well). If
anyone asks you for a
memberships fee tell them
to get stuffed, and find
Carl, Quentin or me, or
come and report it to the
Union Office.
Dotted around you will
find various business
organisations. The fact that
they will be there is not in
itself a recommendation of
what they have to offer.
They are, however, not to
be ignored there is a
chance that they are
offering something that you
want or need.
On a very cheerful note,
the bars in both buildings
will stay open until 4.30pm.
The Union Snack Bar
Has now reopened (thank
goodness—three months of
Union Bar food is
HORRIBLE). Although only
a year old it already has a
reputation (well deserved )
for providing the best and
cheapest food on campus.
We want to make it better,
so if you have any ideas on
improving it in anyway let
Norman or me know.
Personal Safety
Is most important to this
end rape alarms are
available free of charge to
all women students. To get
yours pop up to the Union
office and ask for one from
Kathy or me.
Security
Is a college of this size is
a major problem. Property
left unattended is easy pray
for walk in thieves. To stop
this don't leave valuables
(especially, money
chequesbooks, -credit
cards) lying around; make
sure that the door to your
room is locked when you
are not in; don't let any
strangers into your hall or
house. The most common
targets for thieves however,
are push bikes. Protect
yours. College security
have organised two ways of
helping you. With this:
firstly the Police will be
post coding bikes ih the
Sherfield Ante-Room this
week; Secondly Citadel
bike locks are available
from the main security desk
in the Sherfield Building at
cost price, £15. These
locks, which are almost
impossible to remove
without their key, are a
worthwhile investment.

Parking Permits
As there is a limited
amount of parking space
around college, parking
permits will be issued on a
merit basis. The Union only
has 172 to issue to students
so competition is usually
stiff so I would implore you
not to apply for one unless
you really need it as it will
just cause unnecessary
work for the Union Exec.
Application forms are
available form the Union
office and must be returned
thence before 5.30pm on
Friday 4 October or your
application will not be
accepted. The successful
applications will be listed in
the following week's FELIX.
Union Cards
ICU Cards and ULU
cards will be available at
registration on production
of a valid registration slip
and too passpost sized
photographs. These should
be carried at all times.
Insurance
For those living in halls
of residence and student
houses, there is a
possessions insurances
policy held in college for
which you pay a small sum
as part of the first term's
bill. Not all items are
covered (eg bicycles and
items over £150 individual
value), so if you are in any
doubt please feel free to
come and see me in the
Union office to clairify any
problems. If a claim needs
to be made, claim forms
are available form the
Union Office on the
Financial Department in
Sherfield (level 4).
