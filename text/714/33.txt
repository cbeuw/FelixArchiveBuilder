DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.
1. Bars and Bulk Purchasing.
Last year NUS decided to take over the v a r i o u s bulk purchasing c o n s o r t i a
which had developed over the l a s t ten years. These c o n s o r t i a s u c c e s s f u l l y
negotiated l a r g e s c a l e d i s c o u n t s on bulk purchasing f o r students' unions
throughout the country. In J u l y Quentin and I attended the Bars Working
Party Conference. Despite o p p o s i t i o n from us and some other London
c o l l e g e s , the BWP decided t o d i s s o l v e i t s e l f i n favour o f t h i s NUS
dominated N a t i o n a l Student S e r v i c e s O r g a n i s a t i o n . In the meantime, as
mandated by C o u n c i l I have organised a couple of i n f o r m a l meetings w i t h
other London Unions, w i t h a view t o s e t t i n g up a London consortium. No
commitment t o do t h i s , t r y t o change NSSO from w i t h i n or go i t alone has
been reached. Instead, a g e n e r a l f e e l i n g t o wait f o r ULU t o take a l e a d ,
was reached. Once ULU has decided upon i t s stance on t h i s i s s u e I w i l l
report back w i t h d e f i n i t e proposals f o r our course o f a c t i o n .
