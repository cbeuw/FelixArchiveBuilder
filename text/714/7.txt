taeching standards'.

Hall Plans Revealed
The prospect of a new Hall
of Residence for IC came a
step closer when the
results of a feasibility study
were unveiled at a special
residence meeting.
The study proposes the
building of a 147 bedroom
residence above the sports
centre in Princes Garden.
The facade and height are
designed to blend in with
the adjoining terraced
houses.
Significant problems are
still to be overcome. Local
residents are likely to
object to having another
hall built in the area.
It is not yet clear whether
the hall will be used by
undergraduates or
postgraduates. It is
proposed, though, that the
residence should be built to

a higher standard than
Southside so that it could
attract a higher income
from summer users. If this
proposal is adopted it
precludes a PG only hall.

Boat
Bonanza
Imperial College Boat Club
are to get a new eight,
despite the UFC decision
that the Union could not
afford one. The Athletics
Clubs Committee decided
to buy the boat when they
discovered that they had
underspent by a significant
sum.
The decision was
criticised by several senior
Union Officers. They
claimed that A C C Shouldn't
have overturned the UFC
decison. They claimed that
boat club don't need a new
eight as they already have
two.
The new eight will cost
the Union about eight
thousand pounds. It is
estimated that the Union
will overspend by five
thousand pounds.
Burgess
Banned
Carl Burgess, ICU
President, has been banned
from living in Room 434,
Linstead Hall, the room that
is traditionally occupied by
IC Presidents. The decision
was taken after Dr Richard
Clarke, Warden of Linstead
Hall, objected to having Mr
Burgess because of Mr
Burgess's reputation for
wrecking his room. Dr
Clarke complained that the
room Mr Burgess had
occupied in Southside this
year was in such a state,
that the cleaners refused to
go in it.
Mr Burgess claims that
he has been picked upon.
He says he has been
unable to discuss the
problem with Dr Clarke
because the complaint was
made while he was in the
middle of his examinations.
Mr Burgess has now found
a place to live in Willis
Jackson.
