Film Night.
Tess and the Honorary
Consul. Any film starring
Natasha Kinski is worth
going to see. Ms Kinski is
sensual without flaunting
herself. Her performances
are haunting. Tess is one of
her best fims. Highly
recommended.

This is the biggest party in
Fresher's week. Headlining
are Dr and the Medics, an
outrageous pyshedelic
band. Supporting will be
four of London's top bands
In addition there will be
two discos, videos, a late
bar, barbeque and films
IC UGMs seem daunting at first.Procedural wrangles seem to dominate. They do,
however, decide Union Policy and so are worth going to. The Highlight this week should
be the Rag Mag debate.
