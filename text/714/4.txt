Gareth Pulls It Off
Swift action by Bar Committee Secretary, Gareth
Fish, last week brought to an end the selling of
beer at inflated prices in College bars. It was Mr
Fish's careful scrutiny of the new price list, drawn
up by refectory manager Rob Northey, which
brought the errors to light.
Mr Northey presented the
revised prices when the Bar
Committee met on Monday
16 September. The
increases, he said, were to
maintain beer prices at the
40% gross profit margin in
Southside bar as agreed
between Mr Northey's
predecessor Victor
Mooney, and former ICU
Deputy President Christine
Teller. The new price list
included some severe
increases in the cost of
certain beers, mixers, fruit
juices and hot and cold bar
food. No major objections
were made during the
meeting, and the new
prices were subsequently
introduced last Tuesday.
The alarm was raised by
Mr Fish after he had had
time to check the proposed
prices. His own
calculations showed that
almost every brand of beer
had been priced above the
agreed mark-up level.
Union president Carl
Burgess and Deputy
President Dave Kingston
brought the matter to Mr
Northey's attention last
Thursday. Mr Northey
immediately agreed to
reduce the price of many of
the beers. He admitted that
the new prices had been
calculated on the basis of a
40% profit margin at Union
Bar rates. Draft beer prices
are traditionally 2p lower in
the Union Bar than those in
Southside, hence his
calculations were wrong.
Mr Fish maintains that
many prices are still too
high. He claims that none
of the benefits of the
substantial discounts which
the bars receive from the
breweries are being passed
on to the customer.
In an interview with
FELIX, Mr Northey said that
some of the apparent
surplus was offset by
wastage and by free drinks
provided for bar staff. The
prices of food in the bars,
he explained, had been re-
organised to bring them
into line with the prices in
the refectories. Neither
food prices, nor those of
mixers and fruit juices were
covered by the 40%
agreement, which applied
to beer only. Mr Northey
stressed, however that he
was aiming to agree a
pricing policy so that there
could be no further
disputes.
There was more
discontent expressed about
Mr Northey's management
last week, when it was
discovered that the bars
would no longer be paying
regular student staff as
casual labour. Instead of
being paid cash-in-hand,
students will have to
declare their earnings. Mr
Northey said that many
students worked on a
regular basis and to
classify this as casual
labour was illegal.
'Genuine' students, he
continued, could easily fill
in the relevant tax
exemption form and so
should not suffer as a
result of the change. Mr
Northey also drew attention
to the substantial pay rise,
from £1.65 to £2.00 per
hour, which had been
introduced for bar staff.
Mr Northey was criticised
for not telling the Bar
Committee of his decision.
He told FELIX that he had
not raised the matter at the
committee as it was he who
was legally responsible for
the running of the system.
Mr Northey's comments
were greeted with severe
scepticism by Union
officers and bar regulars.
Mr Burgess was concerned
that the new system of
payment would dissuade
many postgraduates from
working behind the bars, as
they would not qualify for
tax exemption.
There will be a motion
concerning bar prices and
policy at the Union General
Meeting on Thursday. The
motion, proposed by RCS
Hon Sec and member of
Bar Committee, Tom
Meliar-Smith, claims that
the student members of Bar
Committee 'grossly
misrepresented student
views', and calls for them to
be removed from the
committee.

Frantic work was being
done on Willis Jackson
House, Evelyn Gardens,
last Friday in an attempt to
complete alterations before
new residents moved in at
the weekend. Though the
repairs have been in
progress throughout the
summer, it seemed unlikely
on Friday that the work
would be completed when
new students move in on
Saturday. As a result, many
freshers may now be living
in sub-standard
accommodation. Sub-
warden Graham Oakes told
FELIX that there was still a
large amount of painting
and carpet-fitting to be
finished, and that the house
was short of twenty-one
beds.

Rag Drag
The fate of this year's Rag
Mag will be decided at
Thursday's Union General
Meeting. Rag chairman
John Ingham is intending
to propose a motion which,
if passed, will reverse the
ban on the Rag Mag which
was imposed by the ICU
Exec. The decision to ban
the magazine was taken
only after printing had been
completed. Mr Ingham
maintains that his year's
Rag Mag is no more
offensive than the last
issue, which was edited by
ICU president Carl
Burgess.
hopeful that all the
necessary work should be
completed on time.
Willis Jackson is not the
only residence where work
is in progress. Last minute
alterations on the top floor
of Montpelier hall were still
being completed at the
time of going to press. A
small number of rooms in
Rayleigh and Willis
Jackson Houses are in
need of further attention
owing to the recent
discovery of dry rot. Mr
Ferguson said that he
expected this to be
completed by Christmas.
Southside Halls are being
altered to bring them into
line with G L C fire
regulations. Each landing is
to be sealed off so as to
prevent a fire spreading
swiftly through a staircase.
In response to requests
from students, some rooms
are being converted to
provide kitchen facilities on
the staircases themselves.
This work is expected to go
on all year round, but will
discontinue during the
summer term.
Anyone who is still
without a place to live
should call in at the
Student Services Office (15
Princes Gardens) on
Monday afternoon. Some
places in College
residences will become
available through non-
arrival of some students. All
applications for these
places will be considered,
but preferene will be given
to overseas students,
postgraduates, women and
first years.
