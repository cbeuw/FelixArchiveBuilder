At the moment students are fair game
for the banks.
Since you can't convert your grant
cheque into cash you simply have to open
a bank account.
But whereas some banks are only
concerned with getting hold of your grant
cheque at Barclays we're concerned about
stretching it.
W h i c h is why we've put together a
range of services especially for students.
If you're 18, we'll normally give you
a Barclaycard that doubles as a cheque
guarantee and credit card.
Another card you'll receive is a
Barclaybank card so that you can draw out
money from our cash dispensers at any time
so long as your account's in the black.
Provided you handle your account
responsibly we'll also give you a guaranteed
overdraft of up to £200 if you need it.
If your parents contribute anything to
your education, we can help arrange for it to
be paid under a Deed of Covenant, giving you
a substantial tax benefit.
We offer you a special insurance deal too,
designed to meet your needs while you're at
college. A n d should any financial problems crop up,
you can have a chat with one of our Student
Business Officers.
Finally, for the whole time you're a student the
banking's free.
As soon as you open an account you'll be given a
special pack.
In it you'll find a guide to running your account, a
place to store your cheque book, statements and all the
application forms for the other services we've mentioned
If you think all this makes sense, call into your nearest
branch of Barclays and open an account.
If not, on your own head be it.
