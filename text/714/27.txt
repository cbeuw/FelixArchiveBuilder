This competition was first
run in one of the summer
. issues of FELIX. Nobody
entered so we decided to
try again. FELIX is looking
for a Competitions Editor.
Anyone interested should
drop in anytime.
Has your computer just
been sick all over your
printout? Waiting for a
reaction to complete? Rain
washed out play? In your
spare time, why not try
something that's simple, fun,
and could win you a
valuable prize—creative
writing! In each issue-over
the summer (sic), we'll be
presenting various type of
writing for you to try your
hand at. We start with
probably the simplest type,
the rhyming poems,
examples of which can be
seen in most 'Greetings
Cards'. Although the subject
matter of the following
poem is pretty serious
(unrequited love), note the
almost 'happy' rhythmn.
'Shadows'
Shadows of the dark are
rare,
More get get seen in
daylights glare,

A gift I give, the whole day
through,
I give my Shadow to you...
To laugh, to cry,
To have, to share,
My Shadow will e'er be
there,
With hurt and pain
And joys to share,
My Shadow will still be
there,
Through laugh and sorrow,
Secrets to know,
My Shadow will never go,
I have one wish, a hope, a
plea,
When will you give your
Shadow to me?
When you find a 'beat'
you're happy with, try to
vary it, slightly at first. The
inversion in the next poem
destroys the flow, but I think
it emphasises its circular
nature.
The towers that we build so
high,
You pushed me, falling,
screaming, Why?
Through short free-fall I
didn't care
for life again, without you
there,
Who picked me up I yet not
know.
Friend or foe,
Know not yet
Joke or bet.
But hand-in-hand we climb
that stair,
Each step taken with greater
care.
Maybe this time we'll find
out why,
The towers that we build so
high.
Now it's your turn! Any
subject, but keep it
short(ish) as it's easy to get
carried away! If you've
pleased with your efforts,
send them to me via the
FELIX Office. By Friday 2nd
August. Please tell me if it's
your first effort, whether
you'd mind seeing it printed
either here or in the
hallowed pages of 'The
Phoenix', and what you
think of my efforts! There is
a £10 prize for the best
poem published in FELIX.
Entries to the FELIX office
by 14th October, please.
Happy writing...
'Oligo'.
'Where would the world of
writing be,
Without some anonimity.'
