Lloyds Bank
makes Universityless
of a challenge.
Lloyds Further education is an exciting
Hank prospect.
But it can be a financially daunting one, too.
Text books. Food. Clothes. Rent. Transport.
Entertainment. The list goes on and on. Sadly, most
student grants don't.
But help is at hand, from Lloyds Bank.
Come to us with your grant cheque or give us
details of your financial arrangements and we'll give you
a cheque book and cheque card.
As a goodwill gesture, we'll also credit £8 to your
account.*
Our Cashpoint card should come in equally
handy. With it, you can use over 1600 cash dispensers,
the majority available 7 days a week.
We'll also send you regular monthly statements.
And if you stay in credit, we'll waive all normal
bank charges. What's more, we can provide a special
overdraft of up to £200 at a low rate, and you still
don't need to pay bank charges.
And there's the Higher Education Loan aimed
at parents, which makes unsecured loans of between
£500 and £6,000 available.
These loans also offer a special low rate of interest,
as long as the student son or daughter banks with us.
All in all, they add up to bonuses that no other
bank can offer.
For starters, call in at your local Lloyds Bank
branch.
