Where Rag Money Goes
National Deaf Children's Society
Next Saturday Rag will
organise tiddleywinks along
I Oxford Street. The event
will be aimed at raising
money for charity. In the
first of a series of articles
about where the money
raised by Rag goes, FELIX
looks at the National Deaf
Children's Society who
received the money raised
by tiddleywinks.
The Deaf Children's
Society was formed in 1944
by a group of parents. The
society aimed and still aims
to promote the emotional
and social development of
deaf children. It works with
parents to find out exactly
what is needed by the
children. Money is spent on
training teachers to
become specialist teachers
of deaf children. The
Society provides an
information service for
parents on childhood
deafness. It advises parents
on education. Families are
helped by the Home
Assistant service of the
Society. In 1982-83 the
Society spent £182,502 on
helping deaf children.
Much of the money
raised by Imperial College
is spent on radio aids. The
aids are a very expensive
type of hearing aid that are
needed by profoundly deaf
children. These children
benefit enormously from
the aids.
