Over the last few years the
Imperial College Rag Mag
has been produced not to
raise money for charity,
which should be its aim,
but to compete with the
Steve Marshall rag mag in
the bad taste and
offensiveness stakes. The
money raising aspect has
been relegated to a by-
product of this individual
rag mag. It is true that
there is no other rag mag
in the country that can
compete with its technical
excellence but it is a fact
that no other college in the
country (except for the odd
Medical School) would
want to match us in the
nasty, sexist, racist joke
department. Individuality is
not a bad thing but we
have allowed it to take over
our good taste, and to
cloud our judgement of
what is offensive and what
is not. We use fatuous
arguements such as
'everyone says them so
why shouldn't we print
them' and bandy about
phases such a 'Freedom of
expression' and 'free
speech' but with freedom
comes responsibility.
Freedom needs a
framework otherwise the
exercise of freedom by
some will infringe on the
freedom of others. It is time
that we realised that there
are more people living in
this world than the few
thousand students at
Imperial College. Our rag
mag is our public face. It is
the only medium through
which many people come
into contact with Imperial.
Understandably they
formulate their views on us
as a college by this rag
mag. We are branded as
sexist and racists but we
claim we are not as we do
not discriminate against
any group, we go out of
our way to offend every
group. The jokes put in the
rag mag are chosen by the
Editor irrespective of race,
colour and sex, physical
disability, disaster (natural
or otherwise), and people
in the public eye (Dead or
almost).
The question each of you
must ask yourselves is, 'Do
I want to be associated
with such a publication?'
because each of you are by
virtue of attending this
foremost college of science
and technology. You can
not escape the fact that
although you might not
have had anything to do
with its production or
content, you are associated
with the Imperial College
L rag mag. It is your rag mag
whether you like it or not.

Rag Mag
The Imperial College Rag Mag has always been
controversial. In the early sixties, David Irvine, the
historian, was criticised for producing a racist
Rag Mag. More recently two Rag Mags, those
edited by Steve Marshall and Patrick Coll, have
been banned by UGMs. The Guardian used the
Rag Mag as an example of racism at British
Universities. This Thursday the UGM will have
the opportunity to challenge, ICU President, Carl
Burgess's decision to ban the Rag Mag. In this
article, Mr Burgess, a former Rag Mag Editor,
explains why he thinks the UGM should support
his decision.
The reasons why this
sorry state of affairs has
arisen is because at
Imperial there are far too
few people who are willing
to do what needs to be
done, hence one person
will find him/herself doing
several jobs. The rag mag
editor, itself a highly
unique post in the whole
university system who
usually have an editorial
board, is left with the sole
responsibility of producing
a rag mag. For the
information of those who
have never done anything
of that sort this is an
incredibly difficult job the
collecting of material,
soliciting of advertisements,
the production of
completed artwork; which
takes several months. Due
to the aforementioned
Steve Marshall rag mag a
set of guidelines were
proposed by the UGM of
that year that the
sabbaticals had to approve
the artwork copy before it
was sent to the printers and
remove offending material.
However the UGM, in its
infinite wisdom, failed to
give any guidelines as to
what it considered
offensive and decided to
leave that up to the
sabbaticals' own personal
tastes. This is not an ideal
situation, in fact it is a
pathetic situation. The
UGM should have decided
what it considered was
offensive and not left the
decision to two or three
people whose views cannot
be representative of the
majority, I happen to be
very liberally minded and
can take things in the spirit
that they are meant and as
such am not the ideal judge
of what is offensive. Having
been placed in the position
of censor my judgement
should be criticised, and
rightly so, since I have no
guidelines as to what to
excise from the rag mag
which are acceptable to the
majority of students at
Imperial College.
I feel that if we are to
continue to produce a rag
mag we need:-
1. UGM guidelines as to what
should not be allowed to be
printed.
2. All completed artwork
copy must be submitted to
the sabbaticals for approval
subject to 1 before being
sent to the printers.
3. The printing of the
publications must not be
allowed to go ahead until the
President has given his
written agreement subject to
2 that it should do so, and
this must be made known to
the printer on receipt of the
contract.
A Rag mag can be
individual, a rag mag can
be funny but we have a
duty to make it something
we can show to the people
who we are collecting for
and not something the
charities will not put their
names to.
