SF Society
The streets were packed
with the tall, rod shaped
bacteria, each energetically
waving its flagella. Hyde
Park was seething with
them—they had climbed
into trees, high onto the
Albert Memorial
everywhere. On a huge
platform in the middle of
the park a tiny spiral
shaped figure moved up to
the microphone and
shouted, 'Quiet, please,
quiet!' The crowd
hushed—the agitation
decreased. A young E Coli
bacterium tugged at its
mother's gram negative
coat.
'Mummy, why are all these
bacteria here?' His mother
smiled a wistful smile,
'Well, ten generations ago,
the world was saved from
total destruction by the
very first of our race, Burt
the Bacterium. The humans
were about to unleash the
Elastic Bomb on the
surface of the earth.'
'What happened?'
'Well, Burt is a thiobasillus
and he ate the Elastic
Bomb and used the energy
to divide very rapidly. So
rapidly that the humans
didn't stand a chance.'
'What happened to them?'
'We ate them, too. They
share the fate of all
creators. They genetically
engineered us-the new
macro-bateria, and we
turned on them, finding our
creator imperfect'.
'Mummy, I'm hungry'.
'Here's an R plasmid, now
be quiet'.
Far away on the platform
Burt the Bacterium
(number 57), stepped up to
the microphone. The crowd
went wild.
Concrete Canoe!
On 22 June a team from Civ
E n g d e m o l i s h e d t h e
oppostion to take home most
of the prizes in the annual
Concrete Canoe competit-
ion at Thorpe Park.
The Competition is
organised by the Concrete
Society and is for teams to
design and build two-man
canoes from concrete. The
racing takes place on two
days—with the student
competition on the
Saturday and the open
event on Sunday. The Civil
Engineering Department
entered two canoes. Mike
Bartlett's 97 kg, 6m long,
canoe broke up in the
middle of racing after
problems with stability.
Teeside Tech's canoe
suffered a similar fate and
though Maribel Anderson
made a brave attempt at
building a new canoe from
the remains of Mike's and
Teeside's canoes, using
selotape and string, it never
finished a race.
IC's other canoe, built by
Jim McCartley and Mark
Montgomery-Smith did
considerably better.
Despite one of Bristol's
team members 'falling' into
our canoe, making a hole
in the side, we did
consistently well. The
racing required 3 pairs—the
A Team, B Team and
women's team.
The prizes won were:
Overall winning team,
wining team (construction),
winning team (racing),
wining pair (slalam land
racing), Ladies sprint and
Grand slam.
c
The Concrete Canoe teams: D Mark Montgomery-Smith,
Jim McCarthley, Andrew Tailing, Colin Hodgon, Valerie
Anderson, Philippa Addy, Maribel Anderson.
FELIX Monday 30 September 25
