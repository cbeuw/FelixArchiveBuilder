HONORARY SECRETARY'S REPORT TO UGM.
1. H a l l s & Houses Insurance.
Due to some n e g o t i a t i o n s during the suirmer the annual premium has been
reduced by more than 20%. We are not c u r r e n t l y c l e a r as to what i s
required of t h i s insurance by students so a questionnaire i s being
prepared to t r y to put us i n a b e t t e r n e g o t i a t i n g p o s i t i o n .
2. Parking P e r m i t s .
A p p l i c a t i o n forms are c u r r e n t l y a v a i l a b l e from the Union O f f i c e i n B e i t
Quad, the deadline f o r a p p l i c a t i o n s being 5.30pm Friday 4th October.
They are awarded on merit and only about one quarter o f the usual number
of a p p l i c a n t s w i l l be able to be s a t i s f i e d . I f you d o n ' t r e a l l y need
one please please do not apply as i t w i l l j u s t cause us more work. If
you are r e s i d e n t i n the boroughs of Westminister or Kensington & Chelsea,
f o r instance i f you are l i v i n g i n a College h a l l or house, you w i l l be
e l i g i b l e to apply f o r a r e s i d e n t s permit. This of course doesn't mean
t h a t you w i l l get one.
Unfortunately t h i s year we have permanently l o s t one parking space due
to an a l l o c a t e d space being over a f i r e hydrant which the f i r e brigade
are causing h a s s l e o v e r .
3. Transport.
We c u r r e n t l y have four t r a n s i t crewbuses i n reasonable c o n d i t i o n
i n c l u d i n g a new white 13 s e a t e r . I t i s imperative t h a t these vans are
kept i n reasonable n i c k to reduce c o s t s to users so i t i s v i t a l that
they are treated k i n d l y .
A f t e r some c o n s u l t a t i o n s w i t h people i n the motor trade i t appears
t h a t our vans should be run on 4 s t a r p e t r o l not 2 s t a r as has
p r e v i o u s l y been used. A l l users please take note.
4. UGM and C o u n c i l P o l i c y Books.
Within reason I have managed to update these t o c o n t a i n a l l motions
t h a t were submitted to UGM's and C o u n c i l and subsequently passed, some
i n amended form, to d a t e . They do not c o n t a i n the various p a r t s of
p o l i c y passed i n r e p o r t s and minutes. This took a c o n s i d e r a b l e amount
of time and was not helped by some of my predecessors l o s i n g minutes
e t c . , so t h a t i t was not p o s s i b l e to confirm which motions were passed.
I am happy to report t h a t my immediate predecessor E r i c Darbyshire was
almost e n t i r e l y blameless i n t h i s r e s p e c t . Having s a i d t h a t Hon. S e e ' s
are r e a l l y great people.
5 . Coffee Machine.

machine and t h a t the o l d Maxpax one has been taken i n part exchange.
