your life, there's always something new and exciting to do.
Capital Ideas is here to help you decide where to go and
what to do with your free time.
• Theatre
For the next two weeks the
two brightest female talents
to emerge in Britain for
years tread the boards of
Hampstead Theatre. French
and Saunders of The
Comic Strip, in the usual
guise of straight and clown
and with a little help from
Andy De La Tour, will tickle
your ribs to excess for a
measly £5.00 at 8pm every
night until October 12th.
The Hampstead Theatre is
in the Swiss Cottage
Centre, N.W.3. and the
telephone number is 722

At the moment if you go
into the Royal Festival Hall
on the South Bank, there's
a chance to see
'Performing Arts in Print', a
collection of original
engravings and lithographs
from the seventeenth to the
early twentieth century
which chart the history of
opera, theatre and dance.
There are also autographs
and letters to see from
such greats as Verdi plus
portraits and rare prints of
Garrick, Kean and Rossini.
The exhibition is in the
Lyre Room which is open
from 10am-10:30pm daily
and is on until October
20th. The nearest tube is
Waterloo.
