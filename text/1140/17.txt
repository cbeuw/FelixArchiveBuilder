15 March 1999 Clubscene 17
Fallen Angels @ Hanover Grand
Hanover Street, W1. Fridays, E5/E12,
10pm-3.30am. Capacity - 1,200. Dress
code - none.
Last Friday Joel, Stephen (my mate from
the IC IVs football team) and I met up to
review what we thought would just be
an ordinary night of clubbing at the
Hanover Grand. Naturally, we had to
have a few drinks before the club and
decided to try the 'lovely' bars of Soho.
This was a bad move as we had to keep
restraining Joel from entering various
'establishments' - after all we had to
review a club and he could always come
back later. . So on to the club.
The theme of the night in the Hanover
was 'High Noon' and it was no surprise
that many of the people in there were
dressed in various cowboy outfits. The
club itself was quite packed, many from
IC - since if you had a flyer you could
have got in for free before 11:30pm or
for only a fiver after, and I had given
away two hundred of them.
Within minutes of getting on the dance-
floor, I was grabbed by a woman who
kept telling me her name was Louise. I
thought "Result"! Having only been In
the club ten minutes I was being pulled
- things were looking up. It was only after
the 'Louise' in question dragged me
away to a quiet spot and said her name
was not Louise and that she was, in fact,
after some contraband narcotics. (I'm
sure you can work out which ones rhyme
with Louise) that I knew that I hadn't
pulled. On top of that I clearly looked like
a drug dealer. Perhaps I should have
sold her a couple of Strepsils (I had a sore
throat that night).
The music was great, a range of house
music varying from cheesey to the
harder side all expertly mixed by Frankie
Foncett, DJ Marble and Justin Ballard.
Also the packed dancefloor and decor all
added to the atmosphere. There were
two rooms running, the main floor with
all the house music and the downstairs
room with old classics and more funky
sounds.
This night, as a few others, including
Propaganda (voted London's best club
night out in 'Timeout'), are run by John
and Krista (their company is called
Enigma). When I asked John why he
charged so little for entry into club when
everyone else charged a fortune, he
told me that he didn't believe that peo-
ple should pay silly prices to get Into a
club, especially students. Of course,
they make their money at the bar (£3.50
starting prices) but then it's up to you if
you buy a drink. It's an attitude that
should be applauded - when so many
promoters are charging a fortune this
Singles
Single of the Week
Flashback
'Start Da Move'
Superb euro-house track coming out of
Italy on the Slamm label, the 12" has
three mixes, with the A side giving you
a very uplifting, progressive euro-track.
Full of pianos, strings and breakdowns.
The other side has a couple of house
mixes. It's a great dance track with a very
catchy tune.

T-Power
Who Gives a Funk'
Funky single, but too boring and far too
bland. There are two different singles on
the 12" and the second is simply a funk
track with a hard bass line. Both tunes
go on forever and you get bored waiting
for the track to kick in - sadly, it never
does.
Weed
'If Only U Could See'
Excellent single with a host of remixes
giving lots of variety. A couple of mixes
give a very vocal, uplifting and chilled ver-
sion which is great for easy listening.
There is also a dub mix which gives a
superb progressive angle and the album
version gives a D&B interpretation.

'So Sweet'
A great R&B track. This features additonal
vocals from Mr Gentleman and is a funky
upliftng track. The radio mix is the best,
but for soemthing more slow and a bit
deep check out the Headrush mix. Won-
derful vocals, great tune, top single.

'B-Boy Stance'
Not a bad hip-hop/funk track but too
boring and all the mixes sound the same.
The vocals are clear and the tune is really
catchy. But there are seven mixes, and
once you've heard the first track, you've
heard the CD. If there was more variety
there it would be great.
AphexTwIn
Wlndowllcker'
More superb muscial madness from the
Twin. There are a few mixes on this great
single. The first is a chilled out, slow beat
version - a slow melodic song that makes
great listening. The other two mixes are
simply weird. They have weird names
(one is a maths formula!!) and are a col-
lection of random sounds. Not as good
as some of his earlier work, it's still a
good single. Check out the sleeve of the
12".
Hollls P Munroe
'I'm Lonely'
An excellent slow, deep house tune
which was completed in 3 hours and was
co-written by Terence Trent D'Arby
(remember him? No, didn't think so),
sampling his "And I need to be with
someone tonight". There are a few
mixes on the CD version. The first two
sound exactly the same, whilst the last is
a very fast, progressive version. Out this
month.

guy charges sweet fuck all and you still
have a great night. Fallen Angels was
good - not mind blowing, but very
impressive nonetheless. The music is
great, and there is a good, warm friendly
atmosphere in the club (it's a mixed
night). It's not going to cost an arm and
a leg to get in, and you don't have to
drink. Indeed, for the entry price it's a
fantastic night out. Enigma will be play-
ing at HG again soon and I'll have more
tickets for free entry, so if you're inter-
ested then pop into Felix for details on
this and other Enigma nights.
