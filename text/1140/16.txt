Plst.On - pumping Iron.

ah! Turn t h e a m p s u p to eleven.
Put a scary black T-shirt o n . Lace
your D M s all the w a y to t h e t o p .
Do a bit o f head b a n g i n g . Let's RAWK!
O r not as t h e case m a y be.
O n c e u p o n a t i m e I w o u l d have
unreservedly given this full marks but
times c h a n g e . Alas, Pist.on haven't cot-
t o n e d o n t o this a n d whilst it's a decent
a l b u m it'll never w i n a n y prizes in t h e
originality stakes. If you've ever listened
to a n y o f t h e M e t a l H a m m e r free C D s
y o u don't n e e d to buy Sell Out b e c a u s e
you'll have heard it all before.
It's s o o o o o f o r m u l a i c : c h u g g i n g
p o w e r chords o n t h e fast songs, m o n -
strous s t r u m m i n g o n t h e slow o n e s a n d
all this is kept in line b y t h u n d e r o u s
d r u m s a n d a bass y o u can't quite hear.
Don't get m e w r o n g , t h e w a y t h e a l b u m
is put together is without fault a n d t h e
songs aren't necessarily bad, it's just that
they're not m e m o r a b l e . Every s o n g runs
into every other o n e a n d if you're not
careful y o u c a n lose track of w h e r e y o u
are; I missed t w o tracks while listening to
this b e c a u s e I wasn't paying e n o u g h
attention.
O n e thing I d i d notice t h o u g h w a s
that Rest s o u n d s disturbingly like t h o s e
pre-pubescent A n t i p o d e a n rockers Sil-
verchair a n d t h e rest o f t h e a l b u m is
watered-down Metallica. I hate Metallica:
J a m e s Hetfield r e m i n d s m e o f that long-
time Sooty sufferer M a t t h e w Corbett.
But it's a bit harsh to say I hated Sell Out
I still have a soft spot for all this soft Hard
Rock (to c o i n a m u s i c a l phrase). I'm
rather p l e a s e d that it's not all 'Kill your
d o g / Burn y o u r settee/ Rah, c h u g g a ,
c h u g g a ' a n d m o r e o f a pleasant 'Let's
have tea/ G o for cake/ H o o v e r the living
r o o m , y e a h ' vibe w h i c h is in part d u e to
those non-threatening vocals.
The m o s t d i s a p p o i n t i n g aspect o f
the w h o l e a l b u m is t h e n a g g i n g suspi-
cion that Pist.on just aren't trying. I lis-
t e n e d to a track o f theirs that I h a d lying
a r o u n d called Down And Out and it's
exactly t h e s a m e . It's three years o l d .
Y o u ' d have t h o u g h t that in that a m o u n t
of time their m u s i c w o u l d have f o u n d a
little direction, but it s e e m s to have fust
stagnated a n d they're quite happy to
leave it that way. Perhaps if I'd taken time
to listen t o t h e lyrics I'd have got m o r e
out of it but I really wasn't that interested.
A n d I didn't m e n t i o n t h e i m m e n s e hilar-
ity o f their n a m e o n c e . Aren't I a g o o d
boy? CI

fter t h e rant a b o u t m e d i o c r e
e l e c t r o n i c a n d d a n c e m u s i c
compilations a c o u p l e o f w e e k s
ago, it w o u l d n ' t b e u n r e a s o n a b l e t o
expect a similar a m o u n t o f raving this
w e e k . However, as d a n c e music c o m p i -
lations go. Warp Back to Earth has m u c h
m o r e t o offer t h a n your average offer-
ing. For a start, there's t w o CDs, each
with its o w n style a n d each with its o w n
merits.
As a p a c k a g e t h e a l b u m , consists o f
w o r k by t h e Peter-Thomas-Sound-Orch-
ester. The first C D contains remixes o f
PTSO tracks by a w h o l e host o f artists,
i n c l u d i n g a n u m b e r o f w o n d e r f u l
m o m e n t s courtesy of mix maestros Cold-
cut, pop-pioneers Saint Ettiene a n d t h e
super-chilled Stereolab. T h e s e c o n d C D
is pure PTSO, a n d there is n o overlap o f
tracks b e t w e e n t h e discs.
The s o u n d o f PTSO is quite u n i q u e .
I s u p p o s e t h e most appropriate descrip-
tion w o u l d b e o n e o f a mix b e t w e e n
ambient a n d classical. M a n y o f the PTSO
tunes lack a beat, a n d this does o n o c c a -
sion s o u n d o d d , but t h e PTSO disc d o e s
m a k e a perfect C D to put o n if y o u w a n t
to g o t o sleep.
The first C D c o n t a i n i n g t h e remixes
is lends itself to a m u c h m o r e interactive
listening session. T h e s o u n d s are atmos-
p h e r i c , s o m e t i m e s eerie a n d always
involving. T h e p i a n o part o n t h e Coldcut
remix o f Peter in Space is a beautifu
s o u n d that w o r k s effectively a l o n g s i d e
loud, b e l l o w i n g electronic effects. This
t u n e also includes a strings part that is
b r o u g h t into t h e t u n e every s o often
a n d a d d s e v e n m o r e t o w a r p t h e lis-
t e n e r t o w o r l d s u n c h a r t e d . A n o t h e r
a l b u m highlight c o m e s f r o m t h e Japan-
ese Yoshinori S u n a h a r a w h o brings a
high quality s o u n d to t h e a l b u m with
PTvsYS.
Definitely not an a l b u m to bring y o u
d o w n to earth. M o r e o n e t o b e a m y o u
to s p a c e a n d b e y o n d . Brilliant. H
