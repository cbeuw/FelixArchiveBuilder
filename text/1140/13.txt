o m e people really try to m a k e life
difficult for themselves. You k n o w
the type - t h e ones w h o can't write
d o w n the right answer just because it's
right; the ones w h o insist o n arguing
their political or religious beliefs at three
in the morning; the ones w h o d o Aero.
Well, fesfen is a brilliant example o f what
this outlook can d o to y o u .
Four years a g o , a b u n c h o f y o u n g
Danish directors (including Vinterberg)
got together a n d drew up a set o f film-
making rules, which they called D o g m e
95. Under these rules, they m a y only use
natural lighting, a n d must film exclusively
o n camcorders. They called these rules a
"vow o f chastity" a n d insisted that only
thus c o u l d they e n s u r e that their art
remained pure and true. O f course, every-
one else thought they w e r e completely
barmy.
So d o e s it work? Well, sort of.
Because, despite all their talk o f purity, it
still comes across like a series o f gimicy
(and sea-sick) c a m e r a positions. O n the
other hand, it adds an impressively real-
istic slant (through faux-documentary

w h i c h intrinsically lacks these t w o ele-
ments - M i k e Leigh-esque family drama.
You see, Festen translates as The Cel-
ebration, and it's this party - the 60th birth-
day o f an aristocrat - which provides the
focus for the movie. W e meet t h e guests

as, over the course of the next f e w hours,
they run the gamut of h u m a n e m o t i o n ,
via frantic, sex, massive arguments a n d
even suicide. A happy tale it certainly
isn't, but by leaving his movie free o f any
moralising or sentiment, Vinterberg has
constructed a hard-hitting a n d vibrant
drama. D o g m e remains a strange concept
which I certainly wouldn't r e c o m m e n d
to aspiring film-makers, but it has, at least,
proved that it can work. Q

A Civil
Action
D
escribed as " a n e w fast paced
legal thriller starringjohn Travolta
and Robert Duvall", A CivilAction
is based o n a true story a n d hits t h e
screens in the UK this m o n t h . The orig-
inal motion picture score for Touchstone
Pictures is writen by Danny Flfman, a n d
is s c h e d u l e d for release o n the 15th.
Flfman has an impressive list of cred-
its, with scores for 'Batman', 'Batman
Returns', 'Dick Tracy', ' M i d n i g h t R u n '
and 'Mission Impossible' to n a m e but a
few. This list can n o w boast the s o u n d -
track to 'A Civil Action'. As y o u ' d expect
from a legal thriller the songs arc all
o m i n o u s s o u n d i n g as Flfman uses the
orchestra to full, a n d y o u can just imag-
ine Travolta as the big legal hot-shot.
There are twenty t w o tracks o n the CD,
including t h e start a n d e n d i n g credits,
but r e m e m b e r that this is a soundtrack
so all the songs last a couple of minutes
at the most. Q
