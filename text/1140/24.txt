DJ's Sianide & Desire have been presenting a hardcore and hard house dance show for the last 18 months. Over this period,
they have developed a reputation for being on the cutting edge of dance music and presenting an excellent quality show. This
week they tell us about the new releases on the scene . . .
At present, t h e hardcore s c e n e seej|rs l o b e c o m i n g o n very nicely, with plenty o f
n e w tunes a n d remixes f r o m the like! o f H a m , Storm, BANG!, Hixxy, ct cetera. Sony's
support o f m a n y o f t h e finest producers led to t h e release o f the 'Nuffin But Noise1
compilation, o p e n i n g u p this style o f music to a wider a u d i e n c e . With t h e quality
of tunes g o i n g f r o m strength to strength, hardcore should survive for years to c o m e .
Also, thanks to Kaos a n d Energy for c o m i n g d o w n last Thursday evening for the inter-
view.
Cover Up - Case I
A stupidly catchy t u n e by a n artist w h o s e n a m e cannot be m e n t i o n e d . Absolutely
brilliant b r e a k d o w n s but is a little o n t h e slow side c o m p a r e d to s o m e o f t h e other
tunes b e i n g released at t h e m o m e n t . This has to be m y tune of t h e w e e k as it has
b e e n p r o d u c e d beautifully a n d just flows from b e g i n n i n g to e n d . Top marks to t h e
geezer w h o m a d e this o n e .
I lard house is still a very p r o m i m ut usic o n the scene, b e i n g played out
at a large a m o u n t of clubs a r o u n d B h d o n . A f S w labels are p r o d u c i n g s o m e excel-
lent quality material currently, almost to the point w h e r e y o u can buy a record off
the label without even hearing it! B e l o w are s o m e reviews o f m y favourite tracks
this w e e k . . .
Tekno Kings - The Spirit [Shock Records]
A typical Shock Records release: g o o d bass line, p u m p i n g beats a n d excellent break-
downs. The flip side remix is quite a bit faster, with harsher synths a n d a more intense
feel about It. It s e e m s as if Shock is g o i n g f r o m strength to strength at t h e
m o m e n t with releases b e i n g o n a n almost fortnightly basis.
Dreadland (Sy + Unknown Remix)
[Quosh Records]
Builds e v e n further o n t h e remix o f
Tiny Tot's Discoland by a d d i n g a wicked
drum & bass section with a seriously
d e e p bass line, perfect for scratchat-
tacks. The original vocals have b e e n
kept b u t t h e majority o f t h e instru-
mentation has b e e n c h a n g e d . All in all
a t o p remix.
DJ Sy DJ Seduction
Digital Masters - Terminator
[Shock Records]
Yet a n o t h e r release f r o m Shock
Records, this really is a quality tunc.
Samples are d r o p p e d in f r o m the film
'Terminator' at such a rate not to g o
over t h e t o p . The S c h w a r z e n e g g e r
mix is the best of t h e t w o , but it's a
t o u g h decision to make, as both o f
t h e m are w i c k e d tunes. The dark bass
line a n d t h e +150bpm beat makes this
track yet another classic.
Becks - Dynamite (The remix) [Stage O n e ] Hard Beat 5 EP-Vaiious artists [Nucleuz]
This is o n e of my favourite tunes at t h e m o m e n t , probably d u e to the excellent vocals,
cleverly p a n n e d m e l o d y a n d t h e general energy w h i c h it s e e m s to possess. This
o n e is guaranteed to get p e o p l e m o v i n g a n d get those hands in the air. Watch
out for the Stage O n e a l b u m "WOW! What a Rush" which features this tune a n d loads
of other great remixes by artists such as Triple J.
DJ Seduction - Leaving the world behind (Ham remix) [Impact Records]
I considered t h e original version o f this t u n e released o n Hardcore Heaven record-
ings (Seductions sub-label) to be as g o o d as Sedders gets, but w h e n y o u get H a m
doing a remix, y o u k n o w it is g o i n g to be g o o d . The lush breakdowns have remained
similar t o t h e original but t h e rest o f t h e tune has had a proper Next Generation
workout a n d t h e result is brilliant. Another Impact classic.
Ham, Demo + Justin Time - Here I Am ( H a m remix) [Stage O n e ]
W h e n I first heard this s o n g I w a s pretty critical as DJ Brisk did a really g o o d remix
a c o u p l e o f years a g o . O n c e t h e vocals kicked in I thought to myself "This really
is different". The w h o l e t h i n g has b e e n reworked a n d the vocals have b e e n sub-
tly v o c o d e d , w h i c h really makes this tune stand out from the previous remixes. H a m
s e e m s to b e t h e m a n for remixes at t h e m o m e n t , let's h o p e w e hear even m o r e
like this in t h e future.
Three excellent cuts here f r o m a label that y o u can rely o n . M y personal favourite
is by The 49ers a n d is a track called / got the music. The s o u n d s used are of a ve
old skool nature backed by a g o o d strong beat with nice, f l o w i n g vocals over the
b r e a k d o w n . The other t w o tracks are o f a slightly d o w n t e m p o style with s o m e
cheeky samples d r o p p e d in to say the least! M y advice - b u y it. N o w .
Code 42 Higher- [United Ravers Recordings]
A release from Europe o n a label w h i c h has n o w got a n unbeatable reputation o n
the trance scene. It w a s n o surprise to find that this w a s an excellently p r o d u c e d
tunc, with a slightly slower remix to a c c o m p a n y the m a i n track. Wicked vocals,
p o u n d i n g beats a n d d e e p acid b-lines, n e e d I say a n y m o r e . At over 1 SObpm, this
music is not for the light-hearted.
