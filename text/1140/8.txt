The Great Education Debate
You're probably paying a lot for your education, but are you getting your money's worth? Is your degree course prepar-
ing you to go out Into the great wide world of work? Will you have the skills that employers want? Do you even know
what those skills are? Hilary Cadman looks into why current teaching methods aren't the best way forward...
T
he w o r k p l a c e today is constantly
c h a n g i n g a n d e m p l o y e r s , in sci-
e n c e a n d in other fields, v a l u e
adaptable p e o p l e with a w i d e range o f
skills, like initiative, p r o b l e m - s o l v i n g ,
c o m m u n i c a t i o n , creativity, self-confi-
d e n c e , flexibility a n d
t e a m w o r k . U n f o r t u -
nately, s c h o o l s a n d
universities have d o n e
little to r e s p o n d to
these needs, particu-
larly in science.
Traditional science

be learnt a n d regurgi-
tated w h e n exams c o m e r o u n d (and c a n
then be forgotten). Lectures are still t h e
main m e t h o d o f t e a c h i n g at university
level, but w h a t d o y o u learn f r o m t h e m

become more like

than useful scien-
tists"
A final year project m a y well provide t h e
only opportunity for a science student to
use initiative a n d be creative. Overall, the
system e n c o u r a g e s students to b e c o m e
m o r e like w a l k i n g textbooks than useful
scientists.
C a n s c i e n c e be
taught in a w a y that
d e v e l o p s t h e skills

quick look at t h e Inter-
net suggests that it can
a n d surely over a mil-
lion w e b sites c a n t be

most d o imply that par-

the m o d e r n w o r k environment. In true
scientific manner, I w a s sceptical o f these
claims, f o r example, the suggestion that
creating a n 'accepting a t m o s p h e r e 1
in
the classroom leads students to be more
creative s o u n d s fine in theory, but h o w
is it achieved in practice? Would students

p e g g e d o n the w a s h i n g line to detect
rain a n d indicate w h e n clothes are dry.
Impressively articulate, t h e girls explained
h o w their idea originated f r o m an intro-
ductory course in electronics, w h e n they
w e r e asked to think o f an application for
a circuit c o m p l e t e d by water.
Challenged to make the device they
had suggested, t h e girls did so, w o r k i n g
mainly in their spare time in t h e school's
E n g i n e e r i n g club. Steven W o o l l e y '

This type of project, w h e r e students

appears to b e c o n d u c i v e to learning.
N o w o n their fifth prototype a n d burst-

the girls have acquired various skills in

that G e m m a a n d Kobika's success is not
an isolated event. In t h e lower sixth,
pupils are encouraged to enter a scheme
w h i c h links teams o f four students with
an e n g i n e e r i n g c o m p a n y . Assisted by a
m e n t o r f r o m industry the t e a m works
over a period o f 5 m o n t h s o n solving a

Participation in t h e project provides stu-
dents with valuable skills, a n d gives them
an advantage w h e n c o m p e t i n g for bur-
saries and scholarships at university level.
As a selective, fee-paying school Ban-

excellent facilities, but
S t e v e n W o o l l e y
believes that students
at less well-endowed
institutions could ben-
efit equally f r o m this
sort o f activity. Cur-
rently h e is e n c o u r a g -
ing pupils f r o m state
s c h o o l s in Essex to
c o m p e t e in the ' M i c r o m o u s e ' c o m p e t i -
tions, w h e r e contestants produce a small
device able to f o l l o w a white line, or
negotiate a m a z e . The d o w n s i d e is that
these s c h e m e s are not part o f t h e gen-
eral curriculum, students undertake them
in their free time, if they have a n enthu-
siastic teacher a n d sufficient motivation.
Surely such activities, w h i c h equip
students with a multitude of sought-after
skills, could be incorporated into science
e d u c a t i o n in schools a n d universities to
p r o d u c e a m o r e relevant teaching pro-
g r a m m e .
