ping fifth from Dave Stewart secured the
victory. M o r e impressively still, the Pre-
miership title should be secured within
the next f e w days (IC only n e e d three
points from three g a m e s to be assured o f
victory), to ensure an historic double. For
a full match report see back page.
The most impressive scoreline o f t h e
week, however, c a m e at Teddington last
Wednesday, w h e n IC Rugby met ICSM for
the semi-final o f t h e Gutteridge C u p .
Although IC are a fast improving team, n o
one at the match - including m a n y o f the
players - ever believed that they had a
chance against the Medics, w h o are rated
amongst the t o p t w o or three student
sides in the country.
However, within the first couple of
minutes, IC broke from midfield a n d shot-
off down the touchllne to give Andy Mayes
a try in the corner. The stunned sense of
disbelief that fell over the pitch-exploded
into empassioned shouting minutes later
w h e n the ball squirmed loose o n the try-
line, to give Chris Dickinson an easy try. The
Medics tried to raise their game, but a con-
version and penalty from Dickinson m o v e d
the scoreline to 15-0, a n d even a break-
away try from ICSM's Simon Rogers left
them eight points behind, with the score
15-7 at half-time. After t h e break, t h e
Medics rapidly closed the g a p to just o n e
point, a n d normal service s e e m e d to be
resumed. But that was as close as they got,
and a magnificent try from Dave Gol, cou-
pled with t w o penalties a n d a conversion
from the boot of the ever reliable Dickin-
son left the final score at 28-14. The final

will be played this W e d n e s d a y ; t w o
coaches will be available for spectators
w h o would like to attend this great day out
- meet outside the LJnion at 12:30.
Elsewhere, there was League success
for both IC Hockey and ICSM Football. The
Hockey squad has n o w secured the UL Pre-
miership title, a n d should (hopefully) have
made that a double with high hopes for UL
Cup victory last Saturday (after Felix went
to press). Full report on back page. ICSM
Football will join IC in the UL Premiership
next season, after securing the First Divi-
sion championship. They too had high
hopes of a double, with the EJH Cup played
last Sunday. Full report next week.
Finally, IC Athletics stormed to victory
in the U L U Championships. The IC squad
w o n every relay to finish o n a massive 414
points, to w i n by an emphatic 120 points
over Royal Holloway in second place, lor
a full report see back page.
Congratulations to all those involved
in this a m a z i n g display.
As the s m o k e cleared last Tuesday after-
n o o n the forlorn skeleton of a car bonnet
emerged as the culprit of a fire that had the
local fire brigade in attendance.
As a visiting academic was reversing
into a parking space next to the Queen's
fawn he noticed smoke emanating from
beneath the bonnet a n d ran into the BMS
building to report it. According to eye wit-
ness accounts, the fire worsened despite
the attempts of t w o students a n d a secu-
rity officer. O n their arrival, the Emergency
Response T e a m tackled the blaze with
extinguishers and a water hose, Kensing-
ton tire Brigade arrived just after 5pm,
o p e n e d the bonnet with a 4ft crowbar and
had put out the flames five minutes later.
Having realised the situation a n d left
the l-reg Peugeot, the o w n e r actually
returned to the vehicle to retrieve personal
belongings, actions described as "a bit silly"
by the College's Eire Risk Assessment Con-
sultant. He went o n to explain that with the
bonnet d o w n and only smoke being visi-
ble, "it probably looked safe".
The fire, which originated in the car's
engine, melted the light cluster, burst both
front tyres and blistered the paint-work on
the adjacent vehicle. After giving his
account o f the incident the owner spoke
to his insurance c o m p a n y a n d eventually
attended the C&GCA General Committee
meeting for which he had come.
