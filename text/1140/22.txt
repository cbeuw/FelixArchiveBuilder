Idon't read m a n y airport thrillers. I
hadn't read o n e for quite s o m e t i m e
w h e n I w a s o f f e r e d t h e c h a n c e t o
review this o n e , a n d n o w I r e m e m b e r
w h y - they are unsatisfying. This g e n r e
is great f o r a v o i d i n g e y e contact with
other p a s s e n g e r s o n l o n g t u b e jour-
neys, but t o expect m o r e than several
days o f ridiculous v i o l e n c e a n d gratu-
itous sex is optimistic. Character d e v e l -

out o f sight d o w n t h e gutter t o m a k e
way for shocks a n d sensationalism. O n e
constantly feels like o n e is r e a d i n g a n
a d a p t a t i o n of a very poor C h a n n e l Five
TV m o v i e , w a n t o n nudity a n d all.
Characters are thinned d o w n to eas-
ily r e c o g n i s e d stereotypes so the writer
doesn't have to bother describing t h e m
fully. T h e s e protagonists have h u n k y
n a m e s like 'Jack Ryan' or 'Bruce Wayne'.
They are put in a n 'exciting' situation. A
chain Of events inevitably leads to s o m e
spectacular end-piece w h e r e the forces
o f r i g h t e o u s n e s s o v e r c o m e t h e evil-
d o e r s by a hair's breadth - not the kind
o f plot lines d i s c u s s e d o n The Late
Show. A c t i o n is king, art is n o t h i n g .
O h yes, the book. It lives u p t o all
the a b o v e , but h a s s o m e r e d e e m i n g
features. Colette Is the attractive sister
o f Gerry M c V e i g h , leader o f t h e IRA
Belfast brigade a n d total nutter. H e r
o t h e r b r o t h e r , i m a g i n a t i v e l y n a m e d
Paddy, is also a high ranking Republican.

stereotypical Irish types planting b o m b s

Colette gets c a u g h t o n e day trying t o
b o m b Waterloo station a n d b e c o m e s a
'tout' in return for not b e i n g jailed. Her
MI5 controller, t h e h u n k y David Ryan
(no relation o f T o m Clancy's Jack) falls
for her a n d she falls for h i m . They foil
a series o f plots as the b o o k draws t o
its ridiculous d e n o u e m e n t .
Bradby deserves credit for his easy
r e a d i n g style. H e is clear a n d i n f o r m a -
tive, a s befits his job, ITN N o r t h e r n Ire-
la n d c o r r e s p o n d e n t . H i s j o u r n a l i s t i c
p e d i g r e e also s h o w s in his ability t o
give a s e n s e o f c o n t e x t . T h e a c t i o n
takes place in L o n d o n a n d Belfast. H e
clearly o w n s a n A to I o f both cities,
j u d g i n g by the w a y that h e describes
every detail o f e v e n t h e m o s t trivial
w a n d e r i n g s o f his characters. H e cap-
tures the m o o d of the province well a n d
h i g h l i g h t s t h e i n c r e d i b l e disparity
b e t w e e n life in Ulster a n d life in Eng-
land. T h e detail s h o w s h e h a s d o n e
g o o d research - pity h e hasn't d o n e s o
well w h e n t h i n k i n g u p plots a n d char-
acters.
T h e w h o l e b o o k h a s a s e n s e o f
d e j a vu. All the p o l i c e m e n act like Tosh
Lyons f r o m The Bill a n d all the terrorists
are t h u g g i s h m a n i a c s . The u b i q u i t o u s
g r i p p i n g e m o t i o n a l d i l e m m a is 'will
Colette take responsibility for her t w o
kids or die fighting for the cause?' To b e
honest, I didn't really m i n d either way,
a n d as I read t h e last p a g e b e f o r e I
started t h e b o o k , I already k n e w t h e
a n s w e r .
The m a i n p r o b l e m with t h e narra-
tive is that o n e c a n spot w h e r e the fic-
tion e n d s a n d the facts begin. The street
n a m e s are real but the p e o p l e w a l k i n g
a l o n g t h e m are false. The m e t h o d s o f
e x e c u t i o n a r e g e n u i n e but the victims
s e e m unreal. Still, o n e w o u l d n ' t want to
be disturbed b y s u c h superficial enter-
t a i n i n g tat.
I have t o a d m i t that I did w a n t t o
k n o w w h a t h a p p e n e d next at almost
every stage o f the b o o k . It h a d a grip-
p i n g roller coaster plot, w h i c h had m e
e n g r o s s e d . H o w e v e r , as s o o n as I fin-
i s h e d the b o o k I didn't feel in any way
m o v e d by the tragedy. In fact, the b o o k
h a d n o d e e p e r effect o n m e t h a n
acquainting m e with s o m e street names

NASH ENSEMBLE - FOCUS ON THE MUSIC OF
HARRISON BIRTWISTLE
Pureed Room, South Bank Centre
T
he c o m p o s e r H a r r i s o n Birtwistle
came to major public attention with
the performance of his piece Panic,
for s a x o p h o n e , d r u m m e r a n d orchestra,
at the Last Night of the 1995 BBC Proms.
Aside f r o m the inevitable outcry ( s o m e
people c o m p l a i n e d before they'd e v e n
heard the piece), this event established
him as a kind o f British Patron Saint o f
C o n t e m p o r a r y M u s i c , a d e s e r v e d posi-
tion for a c o m p o s e r w h o has b e e n a
l e a d i n g musical figure for over 30 years.
The N a s h Ensemble's concert pro-
g r a m m e o p e n e d with a p e r f o r m a n c e o f
Birtwistle's 1969 arrangements of motets
by t w o m e d i e v a l c o m p o s e r s : O c k -
e g h e m ' s Ut Heremita Solus a n d Hoque-
tus David by Guillaume de Machaut. The
c o m b i n a t i o n o f medieval m e l o d i c lines
a n d m o d e r n orchestration was striking.
The clashes o f instrumental colour a n d
transposition of octave ranges created a
quirky a n d original s o u n d world, without
ever obscuring the original musical mate-
rial.
This was followed by Debussy's Trois
poemes de Stephane Mallarme, settings
of p o e m s by the writer better k n o w n as
the inspiration b e h i n d t h e c o m p o s e r ' s
Prelude de I'Apres-midi d'un faune. The
original m u s i c (for voice a n d piano) was
arranged b y c o m p o s e r Colin M a t t h e w s
for a n e n s e m b l e of t w o flutes, two clar-
inets, piano a n d string quartet - t h e
s a m e i n s t r u m e n t a t i o n used by Ravel.
T h e result, s u n g by s o p r a n o Claron
M c F a d d e n , was delightful.
The first half c o n c l u d e d with another
Birtwistle piece f r o m 1969, his Cantata,
i n c o r p o r a t i n g f r a g m e n t s o f A n c i e n t
G r e e k texts translated into English. The
musicians' parts comprise a n u m b e r o f
options from which they pick-and-choose
w h a t to play at any given m o m e n t . The
result is a s p o n t a n e o u s a n d e x c i t i n g
a t m o s p h e r e that is m a i n t a i n e d t h r o u g h
a musical landscape, ranging f r o m t h e
mysterious a n d delicate t o t h e furious
a n d o v e r w h e l m i n g . Claron M c F a d d e n ' s
p e r f o r m a n c e was o n c e again astonish-
ing.
The s e c o n d half o p e n e d with The
Soldier's Tale Suite - five extracts f r o m
Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale, arranged
by the c o m p o s e r for violin, clarinet a n d
piano (the original is for narrator, actors,
dancer a n d seven musicians). It tells the
story of a soldier w h o m a k e s a deal with
the devil, selling his violin for great riches
- but h e turns out to have sold his hap-
piness with his violin. The piece received
a passionate p e r f o r m a n c e by violinist
Leo Phillips, clarinettist Richard Hosford
and pianist Ian Brown. It was followed by
Birtwistle's Duets for Storab, a set of s
flute duets inspired by Scottish folk music
(more in f o r m than in style); the music
proved interesting, but in the e n d , left
m e a little cold.
The concert finished with o n e o f
Birtwistle's most recent w o r k s , The
Woman and the Hare for reciter, sopran
a n d e n s e m b l e . T h e libretto is by
Birtwistle's f r i e n d , t h e poet David
Harsent, w h o w a s a s k e d by t h e c o m -
poser t o provide a text that was "both
delicate a n d yet violent", for a w o m a n ' s
voice. T h e s a m e description could b e
applied to the music, w h i c h is by turns
g e n t l e , i n t r i g u i n g , terrifying a n d ulti-
mately quite chilling - a truly a m a z i n g
aural experience, w h i c h only served t o
confirm s o m e t h i n g I've believed ever
since s e e i n g his o p e r a Punch andJudy
over the Summer,- that Harrison Birtwistle
is quite simply o n e o f the most brilliant
and compelling composers writing today.
