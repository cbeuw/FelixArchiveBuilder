Last w e e k Clubscene ventured south
of the river o n c e again o n your behalf.
The v e n u e w a s t h e s t u n n i n g Fridge a n d
the night the fantastic, or should I say leg-
endary, Escape f r o m Samsara. firstly,
let's get o n e little t h i n g o u t o f t h e w a y .
W h e r e exactly is Samsara, a n d , o n this
showing, w h y o n earth w o u l d y o u w a n t
to escape from it? Well, in t h e interest o f
your general education I picked u p m y
old copy o f t h e Oxford Children's Atlas,
and h a d a look. But n o l u c k - a p p a r e n t l y
the place doesn't exist, apart f r o m in
the vivid Imaginations o f t h e funkiest o f
London's clubbers. A n d if it d i d exist
then it w o u l d be t h e most w o n d e r f u l
place to escape from.
I won't m i n c e m y w o r d s o n this o n e .
This is quite simply t h e best night in t h e
country's capital. M o n u m e n t a l is the only
way to describe this trancey-tribal fest.
Quite a g o o d start to any review, I'd
say. A n d n o w I'm afraid that I'm g o i n g to
be unable to describe exactly w h a t it
was like (especially c o n s i d e r i n g m y m e a -
gre writing talents!). But there is a reason
for my a p p r e h e n s i o n . Y o u s e e to really
appreciate what Escape From Samsara Is
all about y o u have to g o a l o n g yourself
a n d see w h a t all t h e fuss is about.
A n d s e e i n g is part o f t h e b e l i e v i n g
with Escape From Samsara. This is just as
much a visual a n d spiritual experience as
it is an aural o n e . The night is t h e w h o l e
package, but with a difference. Yes, t h e
familiar list of features spring to m i n d :
brilliant LJV decorations, weird dancers o n
stilts, fabulous v e n u e , jugglers, happy
beautiful p e o p l e , n o attitude, f u n k y
music, top DJs, balloon drops, freebies at
the e n d (bananas in this place), nice
promoters, etc. But Escape From Samsara
has that little bit extra, that s o m e t h i n g
y o u can't quite put your finger o n . I
think it has got to d o with the vibe o f the
night, but don't quote m e o n this o n e .
See, they've got m e talking all N e w A g e
n o w - that's h o w g o o d t h e night is. G o
a n d try it yourself.
O n c e again, I'll say it - this is the best
night y o u can g o to in L o n d o n . There is
absolutely n o contest. Escape from your
everyday student worries by e s c a p i n g
to Samsara. I k n o w I will (every Friday if
possible).
