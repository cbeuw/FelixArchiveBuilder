SULPHUR 16 - RANDOM DANCE COMPANY
Queen Elizabeth Hall
T
he R a n d o m Dance C o m p a n y has
b e e n part o f t h e c o n t e m p o r a r y
dance scene for quite a while, cre-
ating s o m e of the most exciting a n d dar-
ing w o r k s a r o u n d . They c o m b i n e
traditional m o d e r n m o v e s w i t h elec-
tronically animated Images. T h e artistic
director a n d c h o r e o g r a p h e r , W a y n e
M c G r e g o r , has a s s e m b l e d a c o m p a n y
of 8 dancers i n c l u d i n g himself. Apart
from being o n the cutting e d g e o f dance,
he is also a respected c h o r e o g r a p h e r in
theatre and film - he has w o r k e d o n A Lit-
tle Night Music, Anthony and Cleopatra
at the National, Cleansed at t h e Royal
Court a n d t h e film version o f t h e play
Bent. His latest piece is a 70-minute l o n g
mix o f his usual ingredients; t r e m e n -
dously innovative dance m o v e s b l e n d e d
with computer-animated images, w h i c h
tend to be projected o n t h e back o f t h e
stage while the dancers are p e r f o r m i n g .
At the beginning, the artists c o m e o n
dressed entirely in r e d ( o n e o f t h e
dancers is also t h e c o s t u m e designer).
Most of the moves are d o n e lying o n t h e
floor. The electronic music that opens the
s h o w is very intense a n d b e c o m e s quite
difficult to bear after a short while. But
this is part o f M c G r e g o r ' s w o r l d . T h e
dancing is very slow at first, but gradually
as the piece unfolds, the s h o w gets more
interesting. The music develops variety,
alternating between ambient, m o r e fran-
tic s o u n d s a n d classical string music. The
computer animations appear later o n . At
first, t h e artists simply play with t h e elec-
tronic screens, t h e n they project ani-
mated dancers o n t h e performers, cre-
ating a n inspired d u o b e t w e e n reality
a n d virtuality. At this point, t h e s h o w
really strikes t h e a u d i e n c e . The various
ideas include a dancer covered in black
with others in w h i t e with flashing n e o n
lights. The e n d s e q u e n c e is beautiful
with all o f t h e e l e m e n t s o f t h e s h o w
effectively c o m i n g t o their natural
heights.
By t h e t i m e the dancers have fin-
ished p e r f o r m i n g , y o u get t h e feeling of
having e x p e r i e n c e d s o m e t h i n g extraor-
dinary. This is definitely g r o u n d b r e a k i n g
art, incorporating t h e m o r e established
aspects o f d a n c e with the ultra-modern
techniques o f computers. This does raise
the questions o f h o w well these kinds o f
crossovers actually w o r k a n d w h e t h e r
they c a n still b e considered as art. I think
the answers arc to be found in works like
Sulphur 16. T h e mixture o f different
m e d i a is perfect a n d t h e result is awe-
s o m e . T h e e n e r g y that c o m e s across
from t h e close collaboration b e t w e e n
these artists is inspiring for p e o p l e w h o
are l o o k i n g for n e w directions in art.
These are 'in your face1
ways o f stating
that anything is possible as long as the
initial ideas a n d actual w o r k are g o o d .
Sulphur 16 is without a doubt brilliant
stuff. The c o m p a n y will b e back in Lon-
d o n later this m o n t h (28th March), so
don't miss t h e m .

ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE
English National Opera, London Coliseum
R
ecently, I reviewed t h e s t u n n i n g
production o f Parsifal at t h e E N O .
O r p h e u s a n d Eurydice is another
o p e r a r u n n i n g there simultaneously. It
was written in the 18th century by the
composer Gluck. The s h o w Is a revival o f
a very successful 1997 p r o d u c t i o n . The
original director, M a r t h a Clarke h a s
r e v a m p e d it slightly with t h e help o f
another director, but overall s h e h a s
stayed faithful to her first staging. T h e
story o f O r p h e u s a n d Eurydice is very
f a m o u s - a n o l d myth that is always
b e i n g retold. T h e o p e r a b e g i n s with
O r p h e u s in hell. T h e spirits d a n c e
around him a n d he feels that h e has lost
his wife Eurydice forever. A m o r appears,
in the form o f a w o m a n , a n d tries t o
comfort O r p h e u s . H e is t h e n cursed; if
he wishes t o keep his wife, h e must
never look at Eurydicc straight in t h e
eyes. O f course, O r p h e u s d o e s s o a n d
she dies instantly. A m o r returns to save t h e situation, s o m e -
h o w resuscitating her, and the couple lives happily. The spir-
its also stop b e i n g tormented in heil a n d apparently
. b e c o m e free. At this point, a little girl walks a r o u n d
the stage t h r o w i n g red petals everywhere.
The story is definitely not t h e reason to g o to this
opera. I even had a fight with a friend about whether this
version w a s faithful to the original myth or not. The singing
is w o n d e r f u l . The role of O r p h e u s is s u n g by a counter-
tenor, w h i c h is in m y o p i n i o n t h e most beautiful
voice in opera. T h e t w o w o m e n w e r e also very
g o o d but s o m e h o w t h e Polish artist, Arlur Ste-
. fanowicz, m a n a g e d to outshine his co-stars,
j j k The music is simply delicious, poetic a n d
i:;;:
!i Glui k's ideas arc; lovely, with
a choir s i n g i n g t h r o u g h o u t
k t h e o p e r a , s o m e t i m e s
backing up Stcfanowicz
in t h e most beautiful
I w a y . T h e spirits a r e
'' played by eight dancers.
Ihe < horeography is very
m o d e r n with n o particular style. In fact,
the dancing w a s more about m o v e m e n t
and giving t h e o p e r a a physical touch.
It w a s very effective a n d t h e use of t h e
set w a s quite a m a z i n g . The decor rep-
resented hell with lots o f rocks scat-
tered all over t h e stage in n o obvious
layout. The dancers used these rocks to
s h o w t h e different m o o d s o f the hero.
At o n e point, they w e r e n a k e d , a d d i n g
a strong d i m e n s i o n o f bareness a n d
sadness to the s e c o n d act. The directing
and design are both in tune with the per-
formers. This is light entertainment, very
brief (only o n e a n d a half hours without
an interval) a n d accessible t o music-
lovers a n d n e w c o m e r s alike. The E N O
has o n c e m o r e s h o w n its ability to put
o n brilliant p r o d u c t i o n s that draw
crowds. This is definitely worth seeing.
