The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
Goldsmiths' Gain Tuition Victory
By Andrew Ofori
Student power has struck a m a m m o t h blow
in the o n g o i n g campaign against tuition
fees. Students at Goldsmiths' College were
rewarded with college support o n fees
after staging a 175 hour occupation of their
Whitehead Building, in a potent response
to students being threatened with expul-
sion for failure to pay tuition fees.
Union negotiations with the college
came to an abrupt e n d w h e n eight stu-
dents, w h o had not paid their fees,
received letters terminating their registra-
tion. According to the Union "It b e c a m e
clear college were prepared to Intimidate
students", and a rally consisting of 250 stu-
dents was the first manifestation of their
discontent. The Union subsequently called
an Emergency General M e e t i n g w h e r e
the occupation was decided upon. The
Whitehead Building was taken over o n 26
February, coincidentally the N U S 'Day of
Action' against tuition fees. In what was
described by o n e Union m e m b e r as a "mil-
itary operation", the protesters organised
various administrative roles such as secu-
rity and a food committee, and turned the
academic and finance building into t e m -
porary a c c o m m o d a t i o n with a dedicated
sleeping area.
As the conflict escalated to occupation
the college informed protestors it had no
intention of withdrawing its letters of ter-
mination. But the campaign was fortified
by support from a number of celebrities
such as Labour's Ken Livlgstone, comedi-
ans Jeremy Hardy and Mark Thomas, and
Rob N e w m a n , w h o w e n t so far as to give
a free s h o w inside the building. ICU sup-
port c a m e in a letter from Dave Hellard, in
which he stated: "With the NUS currently
dormant and the threat of differential fees
ever real, it is d o w n to the individual Stu-
dent U n i o n s to s h o w h o w d a m a g i n g
tuition fees have been and that the Gov-
ernment not the students need to bridge
the funding gap." Goldsmiths' Union were
appreciative of the President's backing
c o m m e n t i n g , "When you've got support
f r o m Imperial y o u k n o w you're d o i n g
well...it really was heart-warming".
The groundswell of support culmi-
nated in the submittal of an early-day
motion in the C o m m o n s supporting the
objective of the occupation, "Ultimately
this was a confrontation with the Govern-
ment" said Goldsmiths' Union General Sec-
retary Sophie Bolt, as she highlighted the
significance of the motion.
Protestors accepted a High court order
to end the occupation last Friday, after the
college backed d o w n over the expulsions:
"No student will be excluded from college
because of his or her inability to pay fees,
provided this can be s h o w n to be the
case." Ben Pimlott, Warden of the College
stated: "The College frequently calls o n the
Government to increase funding for further
and higher education."
"I therefore fully support calls to ensure
that students, as well as the sector in g e n -
eral, receive an adequate share of the
nation's resources, in line with the Gov-
ernment's education pledge to prioritise
education at every level."
M e m b e r s of the Union hierarchy at
Goldsmiths' are jubilant, and feel their
actions were fully justified, although the
campaign has had its detractors, with some
students unhappy with the disruption to
their courses; one psychology student com-
mented "Many of us have tried talking to
the student leaders and to those involved
in the occupation, but w e are ignored or
s h o u t e d d o w n " . Sophie Bolt, however,
feels the resentment stems from the
actions of the College during occupation,
referring to their complete withdrawal of
lectures in the building w h e n the protes-
tors m a d e every effort to facilitate them
a n d the imposition of a blood-relatives
only policy for visitors to Halls.
According to London Student (24 Feb-
ruary) IC students could soon have their
o w n tuition battle to fight, with the possi-
ble introduction of Top-up' fees in addition
to the annual Â£1000 tuition fees. They are
designed to cover the extra costs incurred
by attending o n e of the country's elite uni-
versities. The claims w e r e refuted by Col-
lege Secretary Tony Mitcheson, w h o stated,
"The College has no plans to introduce dif-
ferential fees".
"Best Week Ever For IC Sport
A n amazing series of victories for IC's Foot-
ball, Hockey, Rugby, Athletics a n d Fencing
squads should see our trophy cabinet col-
lapsing under the shear weight of cups,
awards, league titles and shields which
have been awarded in the last seven days
alone. ICU President Dave Hellard simply
described the results as "fantastic".
The most prestigious win c a m e from
IC's fencers, w h o regained the BUSA
National Championship they last w o n two
years ago. Fully justifying their reputation
as the country's top student squad (thanks
to a liberal dose of individual champions
and national squad members), they rapidly
saw off both Loughborough and Oxford.
Despite a couple of brief scares, the final
result was never really in doubt, especially
w h e n the total superiority of our foil team
(Ed Rysdale, Dave Davidgeand Henry Mor-
ton) became apparent. For a full report see

onships on a regular basis, the s a m e can-

victory even more impressive. Ignoring a
UL Cup drought dating back to 1983, they
notched up a brilliant 5-1 win, to bring the
London-wide UL Cup back to Imperial.
Although the result suggests a landslide vic-
