New Unis In Doubt
Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector o f Imperial
College, has
declined an invitation from London First,
the campaign group, to join l e a r n i n g in
London', a consortium o f universities in
the capital. Imperial however remains a
m e m b e r of t h e 'Russell group', an Ivy
League of older universities, an elite set of
institutions that pride themselves o n the
emphasis they place o n research. As Sir
Ronald Oxburgh explained in the Evening
Standard, the universities in this group all
share a belief in the importance of acad-
emic standards, in "quality not quantity".
University College London, another m e m -
ber o f this group, has similarly refused to
join the consortium. While Imperial, Uni-
versity College London a n d the London
School of Economics took three of the top
five places in The Times G o o d University
Guide, all of London's nine n e w universi-
ties appear in the bottom third of t h e
table, with the Universities of East London,
North London and London Guildhall Uni-
versity all appearing in the bottom ten.
The Rector expressed his belief that
the creation of the n e w universities dur-
ing 1992 in a bid to abolish w h a t h e
described as the "binary divide" between
polytechnics a n d universities w a s "largely
driven financially", because the unit costs
of education in the older universities were
significantly greater
By Sunil Rao than in the polytech-
nics. With a f e w
exceptions, many institutions that were
o n c e highly regarded polytechnics are
n o w second-rate universities.
The refusal o f Imperial to join "Learn-
ing in London" c o m e s after Thames Valley
University, f a m o u s for its courses in kite-
flying, rock music a n d curry making, was
publicly n a m e d as Britain's first failing Uni-
versity. The former Polytechnic of West
London, originally the Ealing School of
Art, w a s d a m n e d in a N o v e m b e r report
from the Quality Assurance Agency, the
higher education watchdog, forcing the
resignation o f vice-chancellor, Dr M i k e
Fitzgerald. A report published by the Gov-
ernment-funded Higher Education Statis-
tics A g e n c y last August also revealed that
over 15 per cent o f students from Thames
Valley remained u n e m p l o y e d six months
after graduation, second only to Coventry.
According to Peter Williams, director
of institutional review at the Quality Assur-
ance Agency, the n e w universities should
acknowledge that degrees must continue
to be constructive, while balancing the
desire t o increase student numbers.
"Higher education must stay higher. If stu-
dents c o m e out with a d e g r e e which
n o b o d y believes in, it is not g o i n g to d o
t h e m any favours".
Bust-A-Gut
O n Friday 5 M a r c h ,
the Bust-a-gut c o m -
edy club in dB's w a s
filled to capacity with many people b e i n g
turned away at t h e door. As usual, M a r k
H o m e (Union Ents Manager), introduced
Ihe night a n n o u n c i n g the unfortunate
n e w s that t h e s c h e d u l e d headline act,
Steve Best, had stood us u p ! N o o n e
m i n d e d as h e w a s to be replaced by t h e
award-winning c o m e d i a n Chris Addison.
The highlight of Mark's introduction w a s
a brilliant put-down to the heckles from
Dave Hellard "The best thing you've said
all year!" - for o n c e Dave w a s s p e e c h -
less.
The e v e n i n g then c o n t i n u e d with
the first o f t h e s c h e d u l e d acts o f t h e
night, Lee Canterbury. Within m o m e n t s
of h i m rising onto t h e stage, it b e c a m e
apparent that, in a w o r d , he w a s a c o m -
plete B r u m m i e nutter! H e involved t h e
audience right from the start, by u n u s u -
ally heckling them, before they had m u c h
of a chance to start o n h i m . As a result,
he enticed the crowd into an above aver-
age n u m b e r of heckles. At first he han-
d l e d t h e s e with great skill, but t h e n
s e e m e d to lose heart, as he just couldn't
keep up! Despite this, his material w a s
By Oliver & Greg
of a high standard,
and kept the crowd
entertained.
After t h e interval, with another no-
s h o w from the O p e n M i c contestant, the
e v e n i n g m o v e d o n t o the headline act
Chris A d d i s o n . Those of us w h o remem-
ber his performance f r o m last year were
m o r e than pleasantly surprised that his
routine h a d i m p r o v e d significantly! He
b e g a n with a popular display of hatred
towards lesser Universities than our own,
a n d also referring (somewhat controver-
sially) to medics as b e i n g arrogant! He
handled all o f the heckles h e received
superbly well, although mid w a y through,
his act b e c a m e baffled by a students
taste in hats, w h i c h w a s quickly confis-
cated by Chris. After his act concluded,
the shouts o f " e n c o r e " a n d enthusiastic
applause c o n v i n c e d h i m to return to the
stage w i t h a f e w m o r e m i n u t e s of
h u m o u r . A n d just for y o u Chris - he was
escorted from t h e stage by 80 strippers!
(I guess y o u h a d to b e there).
The next c o m e d y night will take place
o n 19 M a r c h , with headline act Dave
G o r m a n , a n d support f r o m Robin Ince.
W e h o p e this will be as enjoyable as all
the others have b e e n this term.
