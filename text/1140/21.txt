but as always there are always
ways to grab special items by

These might be w e a p o n s to

they might set o f f a tusami of

After Wipeout a n d W i p e o u t 2097 Psyg-
nosis h a d time t o think a b o u t things.
They h a d just p r o d u c e d t w o o f t h e best
race g a m e s o n any c o n s o l e - ever. Even
better w a s that t h e vehicles didn't have
w h e e l s a n d carried e n o u g h firepower
to simplify parking in central L o n d o n .
The p r o b l e m n o w w a s w h a t to d o
next. They might p r o d u c e nice sensible
racing g a m e s like Formula 1, but h o w
could they p r o d u c e a weird a n d w a c k y
race g a m e that could be original a n d
c o m p a r e favourably against t h e hover-
b o w e r s f r o m t h e W i p e o u t series.
In W i p c o u t y o u didn't t o u c h t h e
ground; if y o u did it w a s t h e scraping
s o u n d o f t h e nose o f t h e
fast angular anti-gravity
craft - o n e w a y to g o from
first to last fairly quickly.
Rollcage Instead takes a
m u c h m o r e wheels-on-
the-ground approach. In
fact they m a k e t h e
w h e e l s m u c h bigger than
the car is tall, and so if you
flip it can keep o n going...even if you are
upside d o w n . The tyres also have the abil-
ity to stick like dried cornflakes to the last
cereal b o w l ,

your o p p o n e n t
w h e n y o u can

The racing
is fast a n d fran-
tic; following t h e track is just
o n e w a y o f finishing t h e race
(the b i g b o u n c y tyres love
o f f r o a d i n g ) . They have also
kept the w e a p o n a n d
s p e e d u p s parts f r o m Wipeout.
The w e a p o n s are less intelli-
g e n t a n d less p o w e r f u l ( n o
'contender eliminated' delight
f r o m this game), but are no
less fun - the ice-sheet ( n o w honestly d o
not write in asking w h a t this does), a n d
the leader missile which follows, catches
up a n d finally
:oes h e a d to
h e a d with t h e
leader a r e
b o t h h u m o u r
laden. In fact
t h e W i p e o u t
h e m e runs
h r o u g h the
w h o l e g a m e .
The

EC
i m p r o v e d , t h e angular hovercrafts that
served W i p e o u t so well are replaced by
m u c h m o r e c o m p l e x a n d curved vehi-
cles, without losing any o f t h e f l o w i n g
m o t i o n that W i p c o u t h a d . In fact this
g a m e s looks e v e n m o r e arcade than the
arcade W i p e o u t XL ride - with very little
pop-up, t h e n o w e x p e c t e d lens flare
effects a n d brilliant b a c k g r o u n d s . The
soundtrack is also impressive, with music
tracks f r o m Fat Boy Slim a n d Receiver.
The p a c k a g e h a s quality s t a m p e d all
t h r o u g h it.
For all those Wipeout fans, the future
has great b i g k n o b b l y tyres.
