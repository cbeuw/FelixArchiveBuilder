UCL 1 2
ICI 4
Well, t h e cup w a s w o n o n Saturday a n d
o n W e d n e s d a y w e put ourselves t o p o f
the league n e e d i n g o n e m o r e w i n f r o m
three g a m e s to d o t h e d o u b l e .
The g a m e w a s w o n in t h e first half
thanks to goals from A m o , Till a n d Jamie.
A m o ' s g o a l c a m e f r o m a n excellent
m o v e involving W a r r e n , Till a n d Alex.
Unlike previous g a m e s , w e got stronger
after w e scored proving to UCL that w e
are t h e best in L o n d o n . It w a s another
class m o v e that led t o t h e s e c o n d , War-
ren a n d Jamie created a half c h a n c e for
Till w h o s m a s h e d it into t h e top corner.
"Dirty" Warren m a d e t h e third goal. H e
received t h e ball inside t h e box within
s e c o n d s h e w a s o n t h e d e c k a n d a
penalty w a s a w a r d e d . Jamie tried his
hardest to miss but t h e k e e p e r w a s
fooled by the "slow' ball.
The s e c o n d half w a s a scrappy affair
as UCL finally m a d e a g a m e o f it with
s o m e forward surges, but in spells w e still
produced s o m e class football. It was dur-
ing o n e o f these spells w h e n Marcos-
Walker-ka-ka scored a nice goal after a
slick move.

it III 1
This w a s a difficult match for both sides
as the It's w e r e battling to h o l d o n t o t h e
top o f the league, w h e r e a s the Ill's w e r e
fighting to stay out o f t h e relegation
z o n e .
It w a s immediately clear w h y IC It's
are on top of the league w h e n the ill skip-
per curled in o n e of his free-kicks (1-0).
This w a s f o l l o w e d by a sweet free-kick
f r o m J o h n D o n o v a n w h i c h w a s finished
by "mighty maestro" Martin Archibald (2-
0). A chip from Julian sent A m a h o n his
way, w h o finished brilliantly (3-0). A J o h n
D o n o v a n free-kick set u p N o . 4 w h i c h
was h e a d e d in by 10 ft Tony (4-0). The
1st half w a s r o u n d e d o f f by t h e m a n in
f o r m w h e n A m a h h e l d o f f 3 players,
turned a n d scored from the e d g e o f the
18 yard box (5-0).
A replica o f t h e 3 rd goal s a w 10ft
Tony head-in another well executed John
D free-kick (6-0). T h e 2nd half was g o i n g
the s a m e w a y as the first w h e n defender
Peter C a m p b e l l had t h e ball in his sights
a n d D U C K E D 6-1, what.a disgrace. This
insult e n r a g e d t h e It's a n d Jules ripped
another s w i n g i n g free-kick (7-1).
Whilst Pete C a m p b e l l picked himself
u p f r o m t h e floor. A m a h scored his hat-
trick after h e beautifully controlled a high
ball a n d left t h e third team's d e f e n c e
b e h i n d (8-1).
This one-sided g a m e was finished by
Darren " h o w m a n y c h a n c e s " Carpenter
w h e n h e finally s t o p p e d kicking m u d
a n d f u m b l e d t h e ball into t h e net (9-1).
This was a n awkward match, played
in a g o o d spirit with very little foul play.
A final m e n t i o n g o e s to Lee Jackson w h o
had a blinding g a m e for t h e third team.
LSEIV 1
IC IV 2
W e d n e s d a y ' s g a m e w a s important for
t w o reasons. Firstly w e n e e d e d to c o n -
tinue our quality w i n n i n g streak, a n d sec-
o n d l y w e n e e d e d t o prove w e w e r e t h e
best fourth t e a m in L o n d o n .
Dave "the Suit" Wishart turned u p
drunk as a lord, a n d Stu "Arrested" C o o k
a n d A d a m "Five in his belly" G i b s o n both
had 5 pints before kick off.
LSE IV's are the only t e a m w h o c a n
match us for spirit, but even that wasn't
e n o u g h today. N i m a "the m a n " Jalali w a s
superb a n d Stephen "should've s c o r e d "
Dewar pulled t h r o u g h . A l t h o u g h w e
w e r e one-nil d o w n at halftime, w e k n e w
w e could turn it a r o u n d . In t h e 2nd half
w e w e r e quite simply first class. Ricki
equalised with a goal h e lashed into t h e
back o f the net, a n d from then o n w e
s h o w e d t h e true passion o f the fourths.
The back four played exceptionally well,
Nick "Rollerblades" C h a p m a n , Richard
"Skinny" Taylor a n d Elliot "Warren" New-
s o m e all playing out o f their skins, leav-
ing Stu with nothing to d o in the 2nd half.
It w a s left to G u r m to score t h e w i n n e r
and w h a t a goal it was!
What a g a m e , what a performance,
w h a t a result. W e truly are t h e best
fourth t e a m in L o n d o n . Jurassic Park!
ICVI 14
Heythrop College 1
The sixth's t e a m last h o m e g a m e o f t h e
season resulted in o u r record win, a 14-
1 thrashing of Division Six's s o - c a l l e d
" G o d s q u a d " , w h o h a d t h e m s e l v e s
picked u p a shock point against pace-set-
ters R S M II only last W e d n e s d a y .
The first goal c a m e early, with a c o n -
fident piece of finishing from midfield
general Alex, f o l l o w e d by a further three
o n t h e half, punctuated by a lone reply
from t h e visitors. A n d w e hadn't even
started playing yet.
After the skipper's inspiring half-time
talk, w e just about s h a d e d t h e s e c o n d
half 10-0, man-of-the-match M i k e encour-
a g i n g us to g o with the flow! After stern
resistance f r o m t h e Heythrop defence,
the first goal eventually c a m e , a n d it
caused a n avalanche. With m e m o r i e s o f
'98 u n d i m i n i s h e d , t h e French partner-
ship in midfield t o o k hold of the g a m e .
Super-sub Raby c a m e o n to his c u s t o m -
ary g o o d effect, scoring o n e of the three
hat-tricks o f t h e day, t h e others from
top-scorer "the D o c " a n d stressed out
"Stan." Even "Wild T h i n g " g r a b b e d a
brace! T h e g a m e w a s also notable for
the c o m e b a c k o f t h e "Polish Pillar" in
d e f e n c e , a n d t h e discovery o f t h e cap-
tain-to-be Nikolich as a dead-ball spe-
cialist.
This result assures t h e sixths of a
top-half finish, a b o v e arch rivals Kings VI
a n d is t h e culmination of a great term,
including recent victories 5-0 over G o l d -
smiths, 8-1 against G e o r g e s a n d a 4-2
h u m d i n g e r over t h e a f o r e m e n t i o n e d
Berrylands boys. All together now, "From
the p u b s o f South Kensington..."
