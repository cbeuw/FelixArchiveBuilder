Blu Peter
"Wldescreen & Digital'
(React)
Brilliant hardbag/Nu-nrg sounds from
the fantastic pioneering DJ/producer Blu
Peter. This is a great album which shows
off Blu Peter's skills at their very best.
Including the club smash "Blue Air" all the
tracks are great, a n d don't actually s o u n d
the same, giving you that 'value for m o n e y
feeling'. If y o u like the fast beats a n d
sounds that are Nu-nrg, then check out
this album.
Out on React Records very soon

Botchit Breaks 2
The Urban Funk Philosophies'
(Botchit & Scarper)
G o o d double-CD compilation featur-
ing a mixture of funk/ jazz/ nu-skool/hip-
hop and all other genres in the 5th a l b u m
fromthe Botchit & Scarper label. The C D
features Freq Nasty, Orange Krush a n d
Raw Deal. There Is a bit o f variety in the
album, but then towards t h e e n d o f the
album y o u get a feeling of deja vu. N o t
bad, a n d certainly worth checking out.
MrsWood/Blu Peter
'Bitter and Twisted'
(React)
'Bitter a n d Twisted' is a fast p u m p i n g
double C D mixed by M r s W o o d a n d Blu
Peter. Over t w o hours long, It is a mix o f
the very best hard house a n d p u m p i n g
Nu-nrg tunes including m a n y o f t h e clas-
sics from a couple o f years a g o .

Deep House
(Millennium)
A mis-leading title for a g o o d album.
D e e p house is a great mix of g o o d house
tunes, but they are certainly not d e e p
house tunes. C o m i n g out s o o n o n Mille-
nium records, this 16 track compilation fea-
tures a very impressive track-listing,
including tunes by Studio 45, soulsearcher,
Cassio, Plastic Avengers and an impressive
piano track "Never" from John Aquaviva.
It's not d e e p house, nor is it anything
new, but the tracks are all great (rare for
a mix album) and Is definitely worth check-
ing out.

The Flava of the Underground
(Inventive)
A compilation a l b u m from t h e fledg-
ling Inventive label b r i n g i n g together
some of the better tunes from the UK soul-
ful garage scene. I got this album o n tape
so the quality w a s crap but it does s o u n d
like a decent album, a n d it's g o o d to know
that s o m e o n e is out there getting people
to notice the soul-garage genre which Is
slowly b e c o m i n g very popular. The track-
listing is g o o d , with tracks ranging from
slow a n d funky, to t h e faster garage
s o u n d . Tracks include "Feeling Fine",
"Groove in Me", "Ultimate Love" and "Body"
to n a m e a few. I'm sure the w h o l e thing
sounds better o n CD.

Weed
'Hard to Kill'
Cracking debut a l b u m from the duet
k n o w n as W e e d . This is a n a l b u m which
assimilates 80's electronic pop, jazz noir
and Detroit a n d European techno as well
as taking inspiration from Portishead a n d
Massive Attack. The C D features ten tracks
w h i c h vary f r o m progressive, to D&B
through to chilled-out - similar to the music
y o u might hear in Ibiza, or Digweed a n d

'ClusterFuck'
(Stay Up Forever)
U n d e r g r o u n d techno o f the finest
quality - the only way to describe this col-
lection of tracks from s o m e of the artists
on the ever-reliable Stay U p Forever/Clus-
ter labels. Although you may not recognise
s o m e of the artist's names, w h e n looked
at more closely all the b i g names that
you'd associate with the label have a hand
in writing or producing most of the tracks.
The drum-based influence of artists such
as D.A.V.L. the Drummer, Chris Liberator,
and DDR, is evident throughout the album.
So are t h e ultra-layered m e l o d i e s that
always c o m e with a Stay U p Forever
release.
There is a nice mix o f songs within the
a l b u m , reflecting t h e w i d e range o f
sounds that fall within this genre of dance
music. People often think o f techno as
being highly one-dimensional a n d stereo-
typical. But, as usual, they are sadly mis-
taken, and this is most definitely shown up
o n this record. ClusterFuck explores
techno's landscape in detail, from the
happy, almost chilled-out 'Frontier' by Dig-
ICU Jazz & Rock presents
It costs less than a tenner a n d t h e night
runs f r o m 1 0 p m - 6 a m . T h e music pol-
icy Is t e c h n o , d r u m a n d bass a n d h o u s e
- strictly n o cheese!! There's a w h o l e host
of DJs o n t h e night including Colin Dale,
Nicky Blackmarket a n d Darren Pearce to
n a m e a f e w . Swallow takes place at
Arch 5 (on t h e corner o f Crucifix Lane
a n d S h a n d Street), L o n d o n Bridge, SE1.
For m o r e details, ask in Felix.
ital Destroyer, to the dark, brooding m o n -
ster that is Cyborg X's 'Cryogenic State.'
There really aren't any album-fillers in this
package, although s o m e tracks d o stand
clear from the rest, which can occasionally
begin to s o u n d a tad repetitive. A n d the
best of these is easily Creeper ll's 'Spoke,'-
a bouncy, confident piece o f softish
techno that w o u l d get any crowd going to
the limit.
S o m e of these tracks were played by
the DJs at Escape From Samsara recently,
and if that isn't a compliment then I don't
k n o w what is. Although ClusterFuck is not
even half as trancey as what you'd expect
from the Escape From Samsara people, it
is still packed full o f e n o u g h twists a n d
turns to keep a n y lover of dance music
interested in listening, or dancing, to it all
night long.
This is for those of y o u w h o love a bit
of British techno, but also it's o n e in the
eye-of those w h o think techno is dull,
mindless, a n d g o i n g nowhere. Listen up
and realise h o w w r o n g y o u are.
