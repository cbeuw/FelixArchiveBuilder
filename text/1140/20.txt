Metal Gear Solid (PSX)

This g a m e is g o o d , very very g o o d . In fact
this g a m e is s o g o o d that within a f e w
days o f playing this g a m e t h e flat, in
o n e of its f e w m o m e n t s o f clarity, w e n t
out a n d replaced t h e small portable TV
with a rather larger twenty-eight inch
b e h e m o t h . This g a m e is s o g o o d that
there w e r e even discussions o n e q u i p -
p i n g t h e flat with a living r o o m stereo.
Believe it or not this g a m e c a n seriously
d a m a g e your overdraft.
From t h e o p e n i n g cine-
matic s e q u e n c e M e t a l Gear
Solid o o z e s t h e quality a n d
sophistication very f e w con-
sole g a m e s ever a p p r o a c h . If
ever they w a n t e d to turn this
into a film, the screenplay a n d
the storyboard have already
b e e n written. Just find a direc-

• oven I c o u l d g e l it oommi-
s i o n e d . As Solid Snake y o u
are an ex-member o f an elite
g e n e t i c a l l y m o d i f i e d f i g h t i n g
squad called FOX-HOUND. Most
of t h e m have turned b a d , cap-
tured a n A l a s k a n nuclear
w e a p o n s storage facility a n d
threatened to launch a nuclear
missile at the Pentagon. C o m i n g
out o f retirement y o u have
twenty four hours to find out if
they have t h e capibility to
launch a w e a p o n a n d
if s o to disable it
before they do. Things arc not
that simple a n d there is a whiff
of an ulterior plot behind it all.
You arrive at the s u b base
with n o w e a p o n s . At this point
y o u realise that this g a m e is
not a slaughter tens of soldiers
a n d get out with only a scratch
g a m e . This g a m e is all about
e v a d i n g t h e terrorists as m u c h
as possible, there are a lot
more of t h e m than there are
of y o u . As experience has
s h o w n m e - if y o u are get-
ting into a fight either have
superiority or be able to run
a n d hide well.
It is also at this point in
the g a m e that the detail
smacks you firmly in the face
a n d refuses to release your
gaze. The characters actu-
ally breathe, a n d b e i n g in
the Arctic clouds o f mist billow
out. Guards hear w h e n y o u run
through pools o f water a n d actu-
ally c o m e to have a look at what
m a d e t h e noise. They can also
follow the tracks y o u leave in the
s n o w . The graphics themselves
hardly differ In detail from those
used in t h e cut scenes - every-
thing c o m b i n e s to form the illu-
sion that you arc in an interactive
movie.
If there could be
a complaint about this g a m e
it w o u l d be t h e translations
from Japanese. If y o u w a n t e d
to create an i m a g e o f a fear-
less killer a n d interragator
w h o had a fetish for colt pis-
tols o n e o f the least frighten-
ing n a m e s y o u could c h o o s e
w o u l d be Revolver Ocelot. So
the g u y w h o likes rocket
launchers Is called B a z o o k a Bunny - I
don't think s o .
This g a m e has b e e n called t h e last
great Playstation g a m e b e f o r e t h e
Playstation 2 arrives, a n d as m u c h as I
w o u l d hate to believe it this might be
true. Gran T o u r i s m o 2 might try to chal-
lenge it but here ladies a n d g e n t l e m e n
is what m a y well prove to be the console
g a m e of t h e m i l l c n i u m .
