He's behind you. BANC. Oh, he was on your side. Sorry.
D
espite b e i n g o n e o f t h e most
acclaimed directors o f his gener-
ation, director Terrence Malick
hasn't m a d e a movie in t h e last twenty
years. A n d , to b e honest, it shows. What
he presents us with here reeks o f seven-
ties anti-Nam anger, c o u p l e d with t h e
kind o f long-drawn-out, m e a n d e r i n g
style that w a s popular w h e n t h e entire
audience w a s out o f their h e a d o n psy-
chedelic drugs.
O n paper, it might s o u n d danger-
ously close to Saving Private Ryan territory
- a 'realistic' (yet all-star) vision o f what it
was really like for the average squaddie in
the Second World War, delivered f r o m a
very A m e r i c a n perspective. H o w e v e r ,
whilst Ryan still displayed certain elements
of your bog-standard Sunday afternoon
war movie. The Thin Red Line has far
more in c o m m o n with Platoon, FullMetal
Jacket a n d Apocalypse Now - this, o f
course, is n o b a d thing. Yet whilst t h e lat-
ter were fired by their directors personal
visions (and indeed experience), to create
a truly seminal, life-altering picture of war,
The Thin Red Line is devoid of any driving
passion. It bumbles along, without plot or
motivation, a n d finally reaches a point
w h e r e it simply stops. For no apparent rea-
s o n . Apart f r o m t h e fact that, having
m e a n d e r e d a l o n g for three hours, any
m o r e w o u l d s e e m excessive.
Like Private Ryan, it provides n o n -
stop streams o f grisly images (although
n o n e to match t h e O m a h a landings in
Spielberg's movie), a n d resolutely refuses
to let y o u pick out t h e g o o d guys a n d the
bad guys - a n d from that point of v ie w it
succeeds. You're forced t o understand
( o n c e again) that this isn't a battle
b e t w e e n g o o d a n d evil (or at least not
w h e n v i e w e d f r o m this level). But we've
b e e n there before. Other directors have
m a d e the s a m e point, a n d m a d e it far bet-
ter. Moreover, they've m a d e it without the
n e e d to t h r o w in a megastar every few
minutes to w a k e the audience up (there's
n o other reason for t h e s u d d e n appear-
ances of Travolta, Cusack a n d Clooney).
They've also d o n e it without resorting to
the kind o f " m e a n i n g f u l " voice-overs that
s o u n d like they've b e e n written by a
b u n c h o f stoned English students.
Harsh all this m a y s o u n d , but the
point is that if a great director (Badlands
a n d Days ofHeaven attest to that) keep
us waiting for twenty years, a n d then his
movie is hailed as "the most important
film of the nineties", you're g o i n g to have
very high expectations. As it stands, it's a
decent movie, fuelled with s o m e cracking
performances a n d brilliant cinematogra-
phy - but by refusing to justify its running
time or provide us with anything new, it
must ultimately, b e j u d g e d a
disappointment. Q
