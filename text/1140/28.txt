regain BUSA trophy
W e arrived bright a n d early o n Saturday
morning, a n d immediately drew Lough-
borough in the semis. Fencing epee were
Rob Neurnberg, Ed Rysdale a n d Karaoke
Dave Davidge. Rob fenced very well winning
all his fights, with Dave and Ed w o n two out
of three each. Sabre c a m e next, with
Thorsten destroying all his opponents and
our captain, Dave Hughes, winning two out
of three, and making up for a lacklustre per-
formance from M o Mansoori. So Karaoke
Dave, Ed a n d Henry Morton had to fence
and win t w o fights to make sure w e were
through - they did and w e were. After lunch
w e lined up against Oxford (1998 champi-
ons). Lpee (their strongest weapon) was first
again and Rob was unfortunate not to win
all three. Both Ed and Karaoke Dave did well
to get a fight each. So to the sabre, and again
w e w o n 4 out of 9 (Mo taking two fights and
Dave a n d Thorsten winning o n e each),
which took us into the final weapon (foil)
needing to w i n six. There was probably
hope in the hearts of Oxford, but this was
soon vanquished by wonderful fighting
from our follists. They all w o n without prob-
lems to take the BUSA team trophy back into
IC possesion after a one year absence.

ATHLETICS
Imperial whitewash
O n Saturday 6th March the athletes of ULU
descended on Tooting Bee track to contest
the intercollegiate c h a m p i o n s h i p s a n d
b o o k their places in the U L U squad for
BUSA.
Only four colleges entered full teams
for the team competition a n d the result
was rarely in doubt after the first half-
hour. Imperial entered every event with
two or three (always willing) athletes in
most.
Marie, M i k e and Dave contested the
Pole Vault a n d Michele a n d A n n e c o m -
pleted ICs first 1-2 in the w o m e n ' s ham-
mer. Khaled and Marie w o n the individual
high j u m p s with Khaled eventually clear-
ing 1.95m for his first victory of the day.
O n the track Angus set a P.B. in a sur-
prise 5K win, while Julia took the 100 a n d
Katherine the 400 in 60.2. Imperial were
n o w well ahead of their nearest rivals.
James a n d Julia w o n the 400m hurdles
events in 59.1 a n d 77.1 respectively.
Souhad finished 2nd a n d 3rd in the triple
and long jumps, while Nadia came 2nd in
the 800m. Marvin and Hedley finally turned
up with Marv collecting precious points in
the 110 hurdles, long and triple jump.
Vicki Frew completed her IC adoption
and in the absence of serious competition
w o n t h e 1500 a n d 3000m. T h e only
remaining sprint final was the men's 200m
but hopes of the day's first 1-2-3 h a d to
wait, as Ed Johnson, c o m p e t i n g in his
fourth event, c a m e second, clocking the
same time as the winner.
The steeplechase saw a tactical battle
as the Imperial pack hung back and let the
early leader get wet. The team coped well
to finish as the first four runners.
The day finished with Imperial w i n n i n g
all four relays after Holloway dropped their
baton in the rush for revenge in the 4 x
100m.
The final table was;
I.Imperial 414
2. Holloway 294
3. Q u e e n Mary / Westfield 117
4. St Georges 66
Khaled and Marie finished as the days
most successful individuals. Khaled
clocked three wins, a 4th and a 5th, while
Marie w o n three events and finished sec-
ond in three others. There were many
other u n s u n g heroes including Boaz,
Andreas, Ed Lee, A n n a a n d Giles w h o
threw, jumped, hurdled and ran whenever
asked. The trophy w a s collected a n d
everyone retired for s o m e well earned
drinks. With the majority of team here next
year, M i k e a n d Khaled shouldn't have to
try too hard to retain the trophy.
HOCKEY
League Champions!
IC Firsts rose f r o m a quiet d e c a d e a n d
s t o r m e d to UL C u p victory last year.
This time a r o u n d , t h e team's experience
a n d maturity s h o w e d , a n d outright d o m -
ination w a s quickly achieved in the BUSA
qualifiers. Then, c a m e Xmas, d o w n to
business: t h e L o n d o n League a n d Cup.
O u t s t a n d i n g p e r f o r m a n c e s include t h e
9-2 t r o u n c i n g of U C LMS, 7-1 at St. Barts
and 6-1 to finish off Q M W . After 6 of the
7 g a m e s in t h e league, w e h a d d o n e
e n o u g h . Imperial are League C h a m p i -
ons for t h e first time in many, m a n y
years!
With a solid d e f e n c e featuring the
greatest skipper since t h e war, M r T; a
l e g e n d a r y m i d f i e l d , i n c l u d i n g o n e o f
the greatest players IC has ever s e e n ;
a n d a forward line that has scored in
excess of 72 goals thus far, (excluding
those by the midfield a n d defence), the
IC b a n d w a g o n has o n c e m o r e m o v e d
o n its w a y to t h e UL C u p Final.
R e a c h i n g t h e Final w a s achieved
with three c o n v i n c i n g w i n s over St.
G e o r g e s , Q M W a n d U C L s c o r i n g 16
goals a l o n g t h e way. This display of
c h a m p a g n e h o c k e y has meant that w e
play Royal Holloway in t h e final, again.
We'll report next w e e k with n e w s of the
IC 1st t e a m s double... without a doubt.
