ULTIMATE FRISBEE
Brunei Falcons 15
IC 9
This w a s IC's first away match o f the
south-east o u t d o o r league. After w i n -
n i n g our first 3 matches fairly convinc-
ingly w e w e r e confident of delivering
another ass-kicking. Things started g o i n g
a bit pear-shaped w h e n our 4 most expe-
rienced players w e r e forced to miss t h e
match d u e to illness or work load (or per-
haps back p r o b l e m s a n d laziness).
W e w e r e ready to clock u p another
m o m e n t o u s IC victory. That was until the
threatening black skies chose this point
to piss all over us. It w a s quite evident
w h e n Brunei started to score In to t h e
w i n d , as well as with t h e w i n d , that this
was not g o i n g to b e another 'easy' w i n .
W e c a m e u p with t h e novel idea o f
tactics, or even possibly a strategy, as a
w a y o f o v e r c o m i n g o u r 3 point deficit.
W e returned to t h e battle g r o u n d with
a f e e l i n g that w e could w i n . H o w care-
less, Brunei rapidly knocked up a 5 point
lead, to w h i c h IC had n o reply. The last
point o f t h e match w e n t to Brunei as
well. There w a s little c h a n c e for a flow-
ing t e a m performance, but 'Short Bald
Guy' did score over half our points. W e
w e r e o u t played in harsh conditions,
but there will b e revenge.
NETBALL
IC 9
King's 48
At t h e start o f t h e match w e w e r e all in
a positive m o o d , h o p i n g that playing at
h o m e w o u l d give us a badly n e e d e d
advantage over a t e a m that h a d already
beaten us twice this season.
The 1 st quarter w a s p r o m i s i n g with
g o o d d e f e n c e f r o m Alex, Kirstie a n d
Dorothy k e e p i n g the ball out o f t h e IC
goal third. Vikki a n d Paula w o r k e d with
m u c h determination in t h e centre third
to f e e d the ball to t h e shooters. T h e
return of Sarah after a wrist injury to part-
ner Sally meant that w e h a d our first full
t e a m in a l o n g time.
S o m e d y n a m i c c h a n g e s to the IC
t e a m in t h e last quarter c a u s e d a dra-
matic increase in pace; with 5 minutes
left to go, t h e shooters finally m a n a g e d
to find t h e net, d o u b l i n g IC's goal tally.
However, w e are pleased to report
that since t h e last King's match, A b b i e
has s o r t e d herself o u t , p u t t i n g in a
decent p e r f o r m a n c e without a n y bla-
tant dissent to t h e umpire. Previously
she m a n a g e d to piss off the King's cap-
tain ( w h o umpired) over her failure to
return to her line in a n acceptable time.
Never m i n d girls - a n easy three
points for us against ICSM next w e e k
(yeah, right!)

ICII 3
Royal Holloway II 3
In this UL league 6-pointer the points
e n d e d u p shared. After a tense 15 min-
utes w e f o u n d ourselves 2 - 0 d o w n to
2 soft goals. T h e 2 n d goal, t h o u g h ,
gave o u r t e a m impetus to play like a
team inspired with s m o o t h one-touch
h o c k e y a n d great m o v e m e n t off t h e
ball. O u r first goal c a m e w h e n G e o g -
raphy T e a c h e r n e g o t i a t e d a pass
t h r o u g h t h e terrain, taking t h e play up
a level to Multi-Storey w h o slotted the
ball into t h e b o t t o m right corner. C o m -
ments f r o m t h e goalscorer are reported
as containing phrases such as "the great-
est goal at Harlington" but this has not
b e e n c o n f i r m e d .
W e w e n t in at half-time 2-1 d o w n
a n d with a n inspiring s p e e c h by Jean-
Claude, w e w e n t o u t to w i n . Holloway
quickly f o u n d t h e m s e l v e s t a n g o ' d ,
a l t h o u g h not very efficiently. Holloway
t h e n , against t h e run o f play, scored a n
illegal goal, w h i c h w a s blatantly lifted in
the D. With 15 minutes t o g o , a suc-
cessful n a v i g a t i o n f r o m G e o g r a p h y
Teacher f o u n d t h e back o f t h e goal.
M a n y opportunities w e r e present during
the match for IC a n d several times t h e
ball w a s cleared off their goal line. G a m e
s u m m a r y ? O u r brilliance versus their
luck.
