Those of us who attended IC kusical
[ Society'a production last term of the
^operetta 'HMS Pinafore', one of the most
I popular creations of the f e r t i l e
I imginations of Giibert and Sullivan,
/ sust I think ha^e gone away afterwards
I feeling that at least they had been given
'omgnificent evening's entertainment,
tnn though there were matters of d e t a i l
rbioh they would c r i t i c i s e . Now i t may
b
e the critic's task to draw i n an as
oeneral and non-commital manner as poss-
ible the overall effect that a certain
performance has had, or ought to have
b
e
d on a particular audience, with an
lir of profundity which deceives none but
himself, or alternatively he may t r y to
ake the criticism that he considers the
irerage man would put forward, but i n
either aiproach to the problem he w i l l
fill simply beoause his judgement i s
lierltably subjective and therefore
personal. He must therefore write from
Ids own point of view and l e t others read
U little or as much as they find i n
bio, otherwise he w i l l be i n the predio-
laent of the p o l i t i c i a n whotaaserted that
b
e would not l e t his oppinions bias ids
decisions.
Good entertainment though i t was
I this performance was also something more
lihlth in the end .has the more l a s t i n g
| effect in the memory, that i s , i t was on
I the Thole executed with considerable
j skill and a r t i s t i o competence. I t was
Iclear from the openL.g bars of the
(oTtrture that the orchestra had gained
e lot of oonvidenoe i n the year since
the last Gilvanian production, and as
the evening went on, t h i s confluence
infected the audience which then had a
reciprocal effect on the cast, building
the whole into a most l i v e l y combination
of entertainers and the enter tained.^
la contrast to the score of ' Iolanthe',
'pinafore' does not give such great
scope to solo instruments, so that the
•ork of the orchestra r e l i e s as one
eight say on team work. I t i s perhaps
j for this reason that there was so much
I lore unity among them at times sounding
|quite professional. I t i s no r e f l e c t i on
JI themselves, but wouldn't i t have been
better if there had been an orchestra
pit built in with the concert h a l l , so
that one didh't f e e l i n danger of being
ought up by an over-zealous f i r s t -
| wiolinist.
Turning now to those on the stage,
one newer knows whether to c a l l them
lotors or singers, but this only under-
lines the fundamental problem besetting
opera from the very beginning. The
wirious oosposers have l a i d emphasis
•OKtiaes on the one, sometimes on the
other aspect, and i t i s f a i r to say that
Gilbert and Sullivan have demanded a
ooniiderable degree of both acting and
linging to sustain interest. Gilbert's
libretti usually c a l l f o r a b i t of
quick and witty tomfoolery at some point
t the action, and on this occasion i t i s
F E L I X
provided by the F i r s t Lord of the Admir-
a l t y , the Rt Hon S i r Joseph Porter K'JB
played by Timothy Dhonau, who was
obviously enjoying prancing over the
stage and keeping the audience r i p p l i n g
with laughter. This he d i d most capably.
_Tt was a_pity he did not display the
same v i v a c i t y i n his singing which' at
times became confused beoause of the lack
of c l a r i t y i n d i c t i o n . To sing e f f e c t i v e l y
one c e r t a i n l y needs a strong voice. Under
this d i f f i c u l t y laboured also Richard
Walmsley singing the part oof Ralph Raok-
staw who sang charmingly but who was
apparently finding i t hard work to
achieve the necessary power, a perennial
d i f f i c u l t y with tenors. Captain Cor-
coran (by David Rymer)happily had a
voice to matoh h i s heart and provided
us with some of the best singing we
heard. His movements were suitably dig-
n i f i e d as beooming the Captain of the
Pinafore and altogether his interpret-
ation of the role was convincing.Com-
petently supporting their Captain were
the Boatswain's mate(by Robert Adams)and
Dick Deadeye (Richard Hasell) both of
whom were very c l e a r l y audible and comm-
anded attention.
Amongst the women,first to appear was
L i t t l e Buttercup (Helen Barker) who,being
physically about half the size of the
Buttercup one i s accustomed to,was able
to put a somewhat new conception, it the
character across.An instance of this wo-
r t h mentioning was Her complete disapper
aranoe beneath a p i l e of s a i l o r s grasping
after her w a r e s — q u i t e different from
what usually happens i n this scene.Her
singing was well-polished and charming
to l i s t e n to.Josephine,the Captain's
daughter (Lorna Haywood) who,on the ship,
i s the chief close of the trouble
was,on the-stage,just the antithesis
and supplemented her actions by a strong
and accurate soprano which at "least on
one occasion brought an encore c a l l from
the audience which was thoroughly des-
erved.This encore was only one of many
which were demanded continually during
the evening whioh was a l l part of the
easy cooperation between p i t and stage
which i s essential i n a professional as
w e l l as an amateur performance.The d i r e -
otor,Prank Kennard d i d not always grant
these encores,presumably thinking that
either he or the audience had had enough,
but to be i n a position to give or with-
hold these "extras"is i t s e l f a s u f f i c i e n t
tribute to him.
The two Choruses were not so accom-
plished i n their singing as one would
have expected,in particular the s i s t e r s ,
oousins and aunts seemed rather s p i r i t l -
ess and t h e i r diction was not always good
a serious matter i n a work l i k e this.Tb-
S a i l o r s were at any rate more vigorous
but again mere lacking i n unity and pre-
cision of expression.I suspect that f i n -
ding themselves on the stage with their
conductor a dim figure behind the glare
of the lights^was largely responsible
f o r this. The matter of adequate rehearsal
i s always a thorny one.
As regards the other components contr-
ibuting to the success of the opera,cre-
d i t must be given to the stage crew f o r
the splendid set they had produoed.This
was a good s o l i d pieoe of workmanship,
possibly the only _fate being the hatch-
way,placed centre stage.Even t h i s was so
r e a l i s t i c that at least one member of'the
audience was conviased she had seen some-
body go down it.Unfortunately,the stage
i s small enough, already and suoh an elab-
orate setup aa we saw only made the use-
f u l space even l e s s . I would have had not
so much the impression that the choruses
were f a l l i n g into the wings i f this extra
room had been available to them. The depth
of the stage was also out by the ship'a
r a i l , b u t no doubt there waa some strate-
gic reason f o r this.The costumes were
w e l l designed and the oolouss blended
very w e l l together.They must have cost
the production a good sum of money.
II
Mention must also be made of.the special
l i g h t i n g effects used i n the second act,
which though striking,should not have
been allowed to obtrude quite so much on
the eye.We were treated to the sight of
an assortment of clouds d r i f t i n g across
a f u l l moon,a type of effect which i n
t h i s technical age i s becoming more and
more expected,but prior to this,a most
novel spotlighting was used, which again
wes continued too long. I t was
rather perplexing to see Josephine's
face f l i c k e r i n g i n the strong light as
she moved about the stage,reminding one
9f viewing colour slides with a faulty
illumination.Of course,the answer to t h i s
l i t t l e problem would have been for her
to remain s t i l l , b u t i t i s not 30 easy
to begin a l t e r i n g these things without
going into a matter of production at length
which i s not the purpose of this comment.
In any case,such suggestions and c r i t i c -
isms would be concerned with details of
what was after a l l a most successful e f f -
ort of cooperation,the general aims of
whioh are probably comment to producer,
director and critic.Many things have to
be taken into account when staging an
opera in. our college and compatibly with
these the society i s certainly w e l l up
to the mark,and i t i s to be hoped that
i t i s s u f f i c i e n t l y encouraged to unleash
i t s enthusiasm again next year.I should
be surprised i f i t doesn't.

A p r i l 1960
G E O R G E
Born i n the c h i l l room of an empty.house,
Fashioned i n secret and i n haste,
A hollow fantasy of rods and wires,
But barely overlaid with paint on paper
paste,
Cardboard afoot, with glasswool t a i l and
mane,
Here was a creature of b r i e f destiny and
fame,
For but a few bright hours
Midst measured music, dancing and
carouse,
And yet a challenge to d u l l thoughts
pedestrian,
A noble animal, Imperial and equestrian!
Was e'er before a f i t t e r horse
To grace the Riding Club's f e s t i v i t i e s ?
Did i t not prove, with prancing hoof,
Its terpsiohorean p r o c l i v i t i e s ?
Was not i t s coat of dapple gray
A prrfeot f o i l to evening dresses gay?
A symbol, patient and aloof,
Yet eagerly i n v i t i n g to the course,
Of careless canters o'er the countryside,
Of moorland treks and freedom thus
personified.
But stay, the morning brought reprieve:
Mounting the steps of Albert's famed
Memorial,
He stood i n easy, graceful pose
For record photographically p i c t o r i a l ,
Thus earning, with equine temerity,
A place with F e l i x i n posterity.
He also s h a l l be seen by those
Who may this glorious epic not believe;
For this the Carnival s h a l l be
accountable,
As he rides proudly by, untamed,
unmountable!
