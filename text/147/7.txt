'Count Baaie has onoe again swung

blowing his top as a band leader f o r 25

lad the band seems to get better and

lai smooth driving sax-section and that
laoosparable rhythm section combine
together to produoe, i n me at least, a
puliation second to none i n the musical

Bier the Count's b r i l l i a n t and s t r i o t
Unction and helped considerably by the

ntblea them to develop as a single unit

The mugshots that you're digging
to starboard are those of Scream and
Diezel the beat poet3 - two stray cats
from the Jazz Gardeners. That cat on
the l e f t - looking r e a l smooth i n jnute
and shades - swings out on box "ad, and
dig that cool boy with the b i g f i d d l e -
l i k e a young Wolfgang Amadous - he's
r e a l l y swinging. Crazy. Like they're
grazing outside the recording studio man.
Gee, l i k e I smell traps there too >oppa
- l i k e r e a l s t i l l - l i f e . Now these boys
swung out of the studio on a rock kick.
Now don't climb on me man f o r digging the
Rock. The way the Gardeners blow i t i s

when t h i s swinging wax appears on the
scene, grab a trey man and get r e a l high.
Crazy. Snap.
Powell p a r t i c u l a r l y impressive. henry
Coker's feature on tribe Song i s You'
showed us what great power and superb
tone t h i s fine section leader has. The
Basis sax-section has always been a
source of enjoyment f o r me, and as always
the present section boasts some f i n e
s o l o i s t s . B i l l y M i t c h e l l ' s outing on
'Whirlybird' was smoothly constructed and
very impressive. The other tenorist,
Frank Foster, swung well on an e x c i t i n g
'Woodchoppers B a l l ' with much v e r b a l '
assistance from the rest of the band.
Frank Wess's solo work i s now largely
r e s t r i c t e d to f l u t e , and 'The Midgets'
with Joe Newman's muted trumpet and Eddie
Jones's a o l i d base, found Wess i n as
great form as ever. But i n discussing
the horn s o l o i s t s one tends to forget the
man who I oonsider to be the best s o l o i s t
i n the band - Count William Basie, piano.
No matter what the c r i t i c a say about
drum solos, Sonny Payne's feature -on
' O i l Man River' w i l l quite r i g h t l y remain
a guaranteed show-stopper f o r many years
to oome. I t was b r i l l i a n t . Nothing
oould follow Sonny's feature without
i t being an anti-climax. The i n t e r v a l
had t o be held a t t h i a point.
'Joe Williams sings the blues' says the
programme, and from the moment this giant
strides onto the stage we hear the Basie
band a t i t s best. I have always thought
that the band swings f a r more when Joe i s
integrated i n t o I t s midst than a t any
-other time. Maybe t h i s i s due to the
happy relaxation whioh p r e v a i l s at this
time, or maybe to the great arrangements,
or maybe simple; to the presence of Joe
Williams - the man who sings the blues.
Rims hot.

IC Orchestra
The Imperial College orchestra
has grown 3teadily i n strength during the
past few years and i t s present size- i s
about s i x t y players. The standard of
playing i s quite high i n a l l sections and
players with experience of National Youth
Orchestras and the London University
Orchestra are amongst the regular players.
The conductor i s Mr Frank Kennard under
whom the orchestra meets f o r rehearsal
each week.
The programme f o r the orchestra i s
a l i g h t opera and a concert each year,
the former being a combined production
with members of the IC ohoir. This year,
HMS Pinafore was produced with great
success during the spring terra and the
concert i s to be given tnis term on May
12th. Works by-Dvorak, Haydn, V i v a l d i
and.Ippolitov-Ivanov are t o be performed^
Stefan i.i'pf playing the solo i n the
V i v a l d i concerto. Many members also
meet to play i n ensembles and the best of
these groups perform a* lunch-time
concerts i n the College. For some time
now, i t has been the policy of the
orchestra to become independent of
professional assistance at performances,
and this objective has now, to a l l
intents and purposes, been achieved.
This i s mainly a result of increased
support from within the College but
also of our friends from the Royal
College of Music, and elsewhere who
regularly attend our rehearsals and do
much to increase the enjoyment of the
rest of u s .
S o c i a l l y , the orchestra i s also very
active, strong bonds of friendship having
been formed with other oolleges through
their musicians. Musical evenings are
held once o r twice a term after rehears-
a l s , when as many people as possible are
coaxed into performing t h e i r f party
pieoes', the r e s u l t being a rase mixture
of humour and musical a b i l i t y .
It i s hoped that the present
standard can be maintained i n the future
and that any member of the College who
plays a musical instrument, i f interested
i n the Society, w i l l come along to one of
the rehearsals. The rehearsals are held,
as stated before, on Thursdays, being at
5.30 p.m. i n 178, Queen's Gate.
