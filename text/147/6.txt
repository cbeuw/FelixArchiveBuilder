W H A T W E A R E TRYING T O D O
The British effort in World Refugee Year is to be specially
directed to help these people:
1. The remaining 160,000 refugees in Europe ;
2. The 8,000 European refugees in China;
I. The million Chlnyt* refugee* in Hong Kong :
4. The million refugees from Palestine.
1. The remaining 160,000 refugees in &
Europe,
Geographically this problem is the
closest to us here in the UK, and perhaps
unfortunately most of the receipts of
WET will be spent in an attempt to finally
solve this European problem. In reality,
of oourse, this problem i s relatively
easy compared to the Chinese for example.
Even so, as a number of students from this
College, who have visited the refugee
camps, will bear out, these people and
their children are in a plight with respect
to health problems and morale. H
o
w can
a child who has known no other life other
than that of a oamp adjust to the world
outside? Our efforts, whether monetary
or in kind can help*.
2. The 8000 Refugees in China.
It i s perhaps surprising to find
that on the 1st of January 1959 there
were over 10,000 European refugees on the
Chinese mainland. Two thousand of these
people have since been moved to various
parts of the world at a cost of approxim-
ately £700 each. Here they have t o set
up l i f e at home onoe more at ease to go
about in religious and political freedom.
The aged and 111 are to receive life-long
care arid medical treatment from Europe
mainly.1
That most of these people were
settled and actively engaged in helping
the Chinese in spheres of education,
agriculture etc., makes the situation
doubly tragic. For completion of the
operation, another £2m and the necessary
visas are necessary.
3. The million Chinese refugees in Hong
Hong long.
The problem in Hong Kong i s
different from most, i n that the refugees
are not interested, i n fact on the whole
are violently opposed, to leaving Kong
Kong. This highly over-populated town
is the "last" free refuge for them, and
most, presumably wish to return home
someday, meanwhile ,there are the
problems of; swivssasdatlon .health and

a skeleton permanent staff.It i s impos-
sible to assess the total ammount of mon-
ey required to solve the Hong Kong ref-
ugee problem,but any contribution w i l l
help to alleviate the most urgent needs.
V . The million refugees in Palestine.
One result of the Palestine conflict
in 1948, was that hundreds of thousands of
men, women and children left their homes
and lands whioh then became part of Israel
territory. They took refuge i n the
neighbouring lands of Jordan, the Chasa
Strip, the Lebanon and Syria. As a group
they are mixed in every way; regarding
nationalities they are mainly Ares,
with smaller proportions of Armenians,
Greeks and other communities; regarding
religion nine-tenths are Moslem and the
rest are Christian; regarding occupations
the vast majority are small farmers,
agricultural labourers and unskilled work-
ers. The smaller proportion of well-to-
do refugees and others belonging to a pro-
fession or possessing any technical skill
have settled relatively easily in Arab
countries. The greater proportion by far
are unemployed or can get only harvest
work.
When i t beoame obvious that no rapid
solution was imminent the fcneral Assembly
of the United Nations established U
N
H
W
A
(United Nations Belief and Works Agency ,
for Palestine refugees in the Near East).
This organisation has an annual budget of
£14su Unfortunately U

W
A itself i s
sure to expire on June 30th 1960. W

then will continue these services which
are so desperately needed?

Have you ever studied the elephant?
Elephants are extremely useful and
i n t e l l i g e n t animals. You personally can
use an elephant; you carouse i t . tO'Win
one of the many fabulous prizes offered at
the Carnival Fete. This parfciqujar
Elephant resides at the London Zoo In
Regents Park. Its name i s Rusty, and
i t i s classed as an Indian Elephant,
although i t actually comes from Ceylon.
There is one other piece'of information
I can supply about this elephant - i t i s
nineteen years old.
How can this elephant win you a prize?
- Quite simple - A l l you have to do i s to
guess i t s weight and chest measurements.
You can size up the elephant by paying i t
a "visit at the Zoo any day of the week, or
you dan study a large photqgrssphl4 feet,
by three feet) which will be on display at
the Fete.
If anyone knows precisely what part of
an elephant constitutes i t s chest will they
please l e t me or the London Zoo know at
once. Our present intention i s to throw
the tape measure_round the elephant, start
measuring just "behind the forelegs and
continue measuring at various strategic
points along the elephant u n t i l we find
the widest part. Whether the measurement
corresponds to chest expanded, chest contr-
acted or chest normal will be entirely a
function of the elephant.
Since the elephant will be weighed and
measured on Monday morning, due account
must be made for Rusty having had a heavy
week-end. This Monday morning i s
Kay the 9th, the Monday after the Fexe,
and also the weekend of 'The Wedding';
that means lots of visitors to the Londem
Zoo and lots of buns for Rusty, so do make
allowance for this in your estimation of
Rusty's vital statistics.

tQne of the attractions of the
C a r n i v s i Fete r e a l l y can be b i l l e d as a
' s t a r ' , for i t i s the representative of t
h
e
Stars and S t r i p e s ; the American Air Force
Band.
This band i s the band o f the Third
American A i r Force which i 3 stationed in
B r i t a i n , and they w i l l be playing for
periods o f the afternoon. Anyone w
h
o h
a
s
seen t h i s American Band i n action will :M»
that t h e i r performance i s a spectacle whii
must not be missed. So come along to the]
Carnival Fete and see the Third American
A i r Force Band.

That i s the theme o f the Carnival
Procession, and everyone who has any
means of transport must bring i t to
join the procession. You may not have
r e a l i s e d i t but the theme gives plenty o
f
scope for imaginative decoration. Just
think o f a l l the things you like in life
(more than the obvious three i f possible)
and they are capable o f being adapted to
the theme. Alternatively think of the
things (people??) you dislike and they
too can be adapted t o form part of the
procession.
The procession starts i n Prince
Consort Road at 1.45 p.m. on Saturday
May 7th and ends, we hope, on the s
a
m
e d
a
y
,
I t i s possible that parts (small parts?)
of i t may s t i l l be proceeding' to Bon
Street on Monday morning, but they will h
e
dis-owned as a heretic sect (i.e. you will
have t o pay vour own 40/-)• The ohanoes
of t h i s are small, however, for we do h
a
v
e
p o l i c e sanction for the route and polioe
coverage at t r a f f i c l i g h t s , junctions etc.
so unless you deoide t o indulge in s
o
m
e
f i n a l practice for the coconut-shy by
' p o t t i n g ' policemen's helmets or traffio
l i g h t s you should be quite safe.
The route includes High Street Kensinj
ton, Earls Court Road, Cromwell Road,
Brompton Road, and South Kensington, I
f
you think you can pedal that far or that
the ' old bus' can make i t with ten on board
then for you the procession i s an absolute
must. So get those banners out, find t
h
o
s
t
ideas that are l u r k i n g i n your mind, a
n
d
bring yourself and your vehiole along to
Prince Contort Road i n time to start at
1.30 p.m. on Saturday 7th May.
