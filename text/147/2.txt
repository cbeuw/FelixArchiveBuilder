At the last Council meeting of last term
cm 21 st. March I resigned as President of
Imperial College Onion. I did this because;
effectively •.majority of the members of
Council and I disagreed as to what was the
function of Council. I believed and s t i l l
do, that Council exists to help run the
Union and mate decisions that would be
burdensome and timewasting i f they a l l had
te me discussed by a f u l l Union Meeting.
These decisions should try and r e f l e c t to
the best of Council's ability what the
Union would want; and i f the Union at
a Union Meeting makes a decision then
Council's Job is to implement that decision,
irrespective of whether or not they as
individuals agree with the majority decision
of the anion.
At the Council Meeting a member of
Council proposed that the Union's decision
to affiliate to N.U.S. be sent back f o r
reconsideration. The proposer said i n
effect, "You a l l know what I thin!, of H.
U.S.," I said i t at the Union Meeting,
l e t s throw i t back." Other speakers
argued that the subject had not been w e l l
enough discussed. Before a vote was taken
I explained to Council what I considered
their job to be, and added that I thought
they would be dishonest i f they voted f o r
this motion. I said tliat I considered
that i f the motion on II.U.S. had been de-
feated and I had proposed i t be reconsider-
ed because i t had not been f u l l y discussed,
Council would have howled me down. I
told Council that I would f i n d i t hard to
represent them at the Union Meeting i f they
voted i n favour of throwing the N.U.S.
motion back. Mr. I . Callow asked i f I
would elaborate what I meant by "finding i t
hard to represent themj^I refused because
to have told them I would resign i f they
did not apyee with me * would have been
putting a p i s t o l to Council's head, which
I had no wish to do.
A vote was taken and Council decided
by M+ votes to 7 with one abstention t o
refer the motion back to the 'Jnion. I
then resigned. Two days l a t e r Council
accepted my resignation; t h i s , after I
had been t o l d by two members of Council
that i f I would admit I was i n the wrong
I oould go back. I believe i t i s what
the Union says that must go, not what
Council says; consequently I do hot be-
l i e v e that I was wrong.
Some people may object tliat 250
people at a Union meeting i s not enough to
make an important decision. No-one i s
more dissapointed than I to see so few
present, I would prefer many more, but a
quorum i s 200 and provided that number i s
prese:.t any decision made i s , I believe,
binding. Also people point out to me
that Counoil does w
a
r
n have the right con-
- s t i t u t i o n a l l y to refer back a Union dec-
- i s i o n . This of course i s so. I f i t were
not 1 would ruled out of order any d i s -
cission on Council about referring i t back.
But Council's right to do this i s only a
safeguard so that i n an emergency or i n
the l i g h t of additional v i t a l information
a Union deoision may not be adequate.
However, such a case could not be made on
this occasion, nor d i d any member of
Counoil t r y to make one.
Council was f u l l y aware too, that i f
the Union r e a l l y were unhappy with the
deoision to a f f i l i a t e , a member could have
sent in a motion bergin,g permission to have
$he matter redisoussed. Such a request is
bound to be granted, no pne ha3 authority
to do otherwise. Counoil knew t h i s as
well as I .
I have been proud to hold the oosition
of President of ICU., and I thank everyone
who has helped me during the two terms I
have been i n o f f i c e . Some people have
suggested to me that a resignation was too
big a step to take on such an issue. I
cannot see any other course of action I
oould have taicen. I believe the issue at
stake to an important one; that i s whether
the Council runs the Union or whether the
Union members do as a whole. To have not
: N -
resigned would have rubber-stamped Council'
decision with my approval, something I
found mwself unable to do. There i s
something about 14 people outvoting 183
people that revolts me.

I see that someone or other has
done i t at last - a do i t yourself
volume entitled "Do i t yourself Parent-
hood".
Now this l i t t l e book has undoubt -
edly oome on to toe market at the right
time. As a Book - critic I have my time
out out reading a l l the volumes whioh
ocme out each week, but I am really
glad that this particular work came my
way just when I was deciding what to
read next. It made my mind up for me,
so to speak. Onoe I had picked i t up I
found i t extremely difficult to lay down
again. Without a doubt this volwee is
going to be found next to the Bible and
'Scouting for Boys' on Mr. Everyman's
bookshelf in the years to come.
Did you know that every child had
a mother and a father? Well I had to
admit i t shook me - up until the moment
i t was revealed en page 27 of this ex -
oellent textbook I had taken the word
of my first sergeant major quite liter-
ally - in fact he seemed to think that
our whole squad had no fathers. I wish
I oould find out where he was stationed
now and I'd send him a copy of "Do i t
yourself Parenthood" so that he could
clear things up in his own mind.
After a l l , i f you knew that someone was
going through life under a complete mis-
apprehension about a certain subjeot, I'm
sure you too would wish to help in every
way you could.
A l l in a l l , I suppose this book Jut
had to he written. How fortunate w
e in
that i t has made i t s appearance in our
lifetime. But what of the Author? 1
am going to be quite honest with you,uJ
straight away admit that the nans of
Sybil B. Xenon, had meant mettbinc to •-
was this work of att her first book •
had I missed other volumes perhaps jut
as great as the masterpiece isting in
my bookcase in dog-eared splendour!
It came as a relief, and indeed a sur-
prise to find the truth about Miss Inn
No, she had not written previous voluw,
and yes, this was her f i r s t attempt at
putting pen to paper.
My newspaper arranged an interriei
with Miss Xenon, and in due course I
turned up at her suite in the Dorobaittr,
I knocked on the door and was admitted
at once by her aproned maid. "Mil*
Xenon i s expecting you," I was toll b
y
the maid, and would I,"Come this way,'
I followed the maid and was led into til
Royal Suite. In a large double bed
amongst a pile of soft pillows reolined
Miss Xenon. To me she appeared as a
n
y
old woman would, exoept that quite
obviously her brain must be the sin o
f
a pumpkin in order to be able to writ)
as she did. She had a long cigarette-
holder in her right hand and with her
left hand was popping large succulent
grapes in to her toothless mouth. "
G
o
o
d
Godl" I thought "She i s eccentric N
she must be a genius." The maid brouitt
a chair to the edge of the bed, and bill
me sit down. At onoe I begged persiiia
to interview Miss Xenon. She oonunts
with a nod of her blonde wig. Hot oil
was she, please, I wanted to know. ?

Scunthorpe. Had she ever been in low'
She did not know. How did she obtain t
a
information for her book. Through
15 x 100 binoculars. Where did ahe lin
before the book was published? Tlern
del Fuego. Did she know her parentity
sight? Miss Xenon did not understand ti
question. Did she find Aristotle ati*
ulating? They were Just good friendl.
What was her job before the wealth fra
royalties came her way? She gutted
herrings.
It *as time to leave and as I nut
go I thanked her for granting the Inter'
view. "Maria, show the gentleman to t
o
t
door." The maid had half closed the 1»
behind me when I swear I heard kin 7
