The first Saturday of the Easter
Vac saw the Cross Country Club start
oat for the first match of their tour
agsiatst Durham University and the North-
umberland and Durham.County team. The
raoe, over a beautiful, hilly, seven an*
a half mile course was of a very high
standard and the team really excelled In
tarlarj second place to the County team.
Result. Northumberland and Durham
County teea 56 I.C. 57 Durham University
58. The main reason for this excellent
result was a fine run by Tony Larkum
who finished second with John Collins
fifth, the rest of the team finishing
eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth,end fourteenth.
After a day watching the waves at
Whitley Bay (where J.H.C, and C.R.H.
looked just a l i t t l e too closely and
got a l i t t l e b i t wet), we t r a v e l l e d
across country t o Stran Raer where we
caught the I r i s h Mail t o Lame f o r
Belfast. After a b r i e f tour for Belfast,
we decided t o have s day i n the country
t r a v e l l i n g by the most fantastic railway
set up imaginable t o Warrenpoint. Here
the team d i d some "hard* training on a
nearby 100 foot mountain Clough Llore,
chasing sheep and f a l l i n g i n gorse bushes.
On Wednesday 30th we t r a v e l l e d to
Dublin where, on the following morning,
we had a much looked-forward-to v i s i t
to the Guinness Brewery but our consum-
ption of samples was restricted on
Captain's orders. The reason for t h i s
was a 3 mile race i n the evening against
C l o n l i f e Harriers "the fastest track i n
the world" at Santry. In this race we
were narrowly beaten by Clonlife 57
points to 50, John C o l l i n s talcing seoond
place with a personal time of 14.27.
Several other members of the team also
reoorded personal bests on this beauti-
ful track.
Friday morning saw the team t r a i n -
ing i n the teeth of a gale on a fine s
s t r e t c h of sand and dunes just outside
Dublin i n preparation f o r the raoe next
day. This,a relay in 6 stages cm of
varying length, was the highlight of the
tour. Every man i n the team seemed t o
give of his best t o give I.C. a very
creditable seoond place t o Dunore Harr
Harriers whose team contained four i n t e r -
nationals, beating C l o n l i f e Harriers
and Avondale, two more of Irelands top

On the boat returning t o U n j . ^
members of the team playing solo took
on a remarkable resomblamoe t o ten greer
bottles as one by one they f e l t the
effect of a rough sea on a large tea
and dashed out on deck "just t o get a
breath of fresh a i r J l " . So ended a
very successful and enjoyable tour.

It offers a varied fixture l i s t ,
sufficient to satisfy the ill—iris and
ability of every type of cricketer, plus

get the ewjdaaal possible enjoyment out of

On the last day of March,a team of
eight left the Union by oar for the North.
Our f i r s t fixture was against Durham Univ-
ersity, playing sir-s-side,and was held st
the K>rtbuBberland Golf Club, Goef«»•*->.
This i s said to be the best comas l a the
north-east,and certainly i t was very tes-
ting, threading i t s way in and out of New-
oastle racecourse. In the morning,H.Godfrey
and B.Noxon won their foursome,and the club
oaptain,A.JJDix-Perkin,and John Street
played competitively to halve theirs. In
the afternoon,we lost the singles,4-2,so
Durham had won 5i-3?,our first set-back.
The road to Edinburgh was empty,we
reaohed i t i n the morning,and played at
Gullane i n the afternoon,a long,windy,
seaside course on the south of the Firth
of Forth.
After taking i n Dalsahoy we crossed
tha Forth and drove to St, Andrew's.On
oar f i r s t day we played pratrtioe rounds
an the recently opened Old and New courses
The links hare run out on a peninsula of
aand h i l l s between the sea and the river
Eesn and provide probably the cheapest

had a latter of introduction to the sec-
retary of the Royal and Ancient,and we
ware privileged to use the fejsoua club-
house. Here excellent lunches are served
at oast price and one oan s i t at a great
bow window and watch players teeing off
an the Old course. A l l this and fine wea-
ther too,made our stay awawrabla,evwn
though St,Andrews bast us 9tV-4. It waa
decided to play wka singles over the Old
in? tha morning and this meant that wa had
to win at least 2+ to be able to win the
match on the four afterneon foursasses. H.
Godfrey and B.Noxon duely wen,but i t was
left to M.J.Rycroft at No.8 to get the
last,-. Watched anxiously from the club •
house he played a courageous third shot
to tks hols ts aawa the match. AlaaXVe

in the afteratwaaa.
Next day we played Edinburgh at North
Berwick,in inclement weather,and lost 7i~i
This was not surprising as only their best
team was available asd lnclndad British,

only half won waa l a tha afternoon by N.
Look and A, J. Dix-Parkin in a four ball.
They returned scores of 78 and 80 respec>-

After a farewell round on. the enures*
of our choice next aoxnlng(John Street
•soring wall an. the short Jubilee course)
we made the short run across the
Tay to Carnoustie where we stayed
the night, and played next day. We
were disappointed with this long
championship oourse which we thought rather
uninteresting, and wa continued to Aberdeen
in the afteanocn.
in the game on the County ground against
Torquay, with all the facilitiea that the
English Slviera can offer.
Dig out those whites! Try your
hardest for the Devon tourJ It's worth
it.
Here we put up at a small hotel
whioh served very good porridge and
waa extremely 'good valise'. The venue
for our match with Aberdeen was Crudeo B

T
,
a beautiful and almost deserted little
course 25 miles north of Aberdeen, and bj
the sea. Tha opening hole* in tha momiij
and the closing ones in the afternoon w

played in a wetting rain. But the sun
waa seen during the day. Again the
Scotsmen were too good for us. Staltatti
H.Godfrey and B.Nnxon won their singloi
wad foursomes ami N. Look did well to win
by two holes in the afternoon. The
result: 8-4 to Aberdeen. Our hosts w

moat hospitable and we went to a hop in
the evening.
After this final humiliation the tew
waa almost over and while half the teas
fled southwards the others motored through
the Highlands to Gleneagles to play two
last rounds in Scotland on the scenic
oourses there. We had a very satiefactor/
day's golf there and H.Godfrey produced
his best play of the tour, having a 72 a
the Queen's oourse and 74 on the King's,
Next day we returned to London. Many
thanks are due to our friends in Scotland,
We hope they w i l l send teams to tour

Saturday, March 26th saw the
culmination of two terms continuous
training on the part of the boat-olub.
The Head of the River, rowed over the
reverse Boat Raoe oourse of 4j; miles
from Mortlake to Putney, saw nine crews
from ICBC rowing, making the club one of
the largest single competitors.
IC's first V i n , starting at number
24, had a steady and uninspired row, and
were overtaken twioe during the raoe
although one of the crews was a fast
London V I H . They finished in a time
of nineteen minutes, 43 seconds, whioh
in the final lists gave thorn a plaoe of
33rd, a drop of nine places.
The weather was cloudy, with a lively
south west wind, giving t a i l wind condit-
ions on the whole of the course exoept
for the Hasawjramith Reach.
There was more confusion at the start
t h i s year as the 300 competitors lay i s
a tangled mass on more than 1\ miles of
the r i v e r . However, the organisation
triumphed, and the maroons t o indicate
the s t a r t were f i r e d very near t o the
scheduled time.
The seoond VIII, racing better than
at Reading, overtook two crews, and moved
up 25 places t o f i n i s h 50th, only 14 seas
behind the f i r s t IC VHI.
Most o f the other IC VTIls went down
i n p o s i t i o n , with the exception of the
4th and the 7th VHIS. On the whole i t
was a disappointing day, but training is
now s t a r t i n g f o r the Regatta season, and
we hope that what we have learnt from
the Head w i l l help the Club towards a
better crew i n the summer.
