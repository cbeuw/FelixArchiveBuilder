Oh oomrades rejoiceI The revolution
has come,
And the bourgeois are beaten at l a s t .
Our fore-runners dream has eventually
come true,
For the NUS motion i s passed.
There's s t i l l trouble ahead, for as you
a l l know,
It was chucked out by Council l a s t term.
But we're got i t through once and w e ' l l
do i t again,
And that w i l l make a l l the 'chaps squirm.
Ohl a great time we'll have' when we
reorganise
The Union and a l l the sports olubs.
They'll a l l have to pass a p o l i t i c a l
exam
Which i s better than drinking i n pubs.
We don't require rugby or snooker or
darts
Or drinking, of these we'11 get r i d .
For with NUS we'll get culture i n
quarts.
(It w i l l only cost three hundred quid).
With counter-revolutionary athletio
F E L I X
The plebs have been blinded, you see.
But now t h e y ' l l be signing 'Pledges f o r
Peace'.
And marching on the AWRE.
For you must a l l r e a l i s e that a student's
free time,
Should be spent i n p o l i t i c a l wise
And generally improving, with culture i n
mind,
And marching i s h i s exercise.
Utopia, at l a s t , as the pliil030phers
foretold
W i l l come, but we're not quite sure when,
And the o l d IC s p i r i t (what a horrible
word)
W i l l never be heard of again.
Our crew i s w e l l coxed, that's certain
at l e a s t ,
So be a l l of stout heart and true
And our orators w i l l spout and continue
to spout,
And t h e y ' l l spout ' t i l l they're a l l black

Oh the bourgeois are beaten, the end i s

We've conquered the Union at l a s t .

And the days of the sportsmen are passed.

This year baa seen I.G.'a biggest •
sporting triumph ever,it' a also been a I
unprecedented so far a* apathy i s eoa» I
arnad.
What are the reasons for- this? Fir-
stly, the- intense enthusiasm of a few' j
people has carried the'dumb- beast' ( u
one member o f the Union calls the vast ,
is of uninspired and uninterested its
enta) along,as usual,but with more succeii
this year than last. Secondly,aa I.C, j
becomes bigger,* few sore people suffic-
iently interested i n the Union to S
O Ut

We now have the stupid position o
f
a few people providing the hard work t
o
make sure that the rest have somewherti
eat,somewhere to drink and somewhere t

Imagine the uproar that would ensue if
the refectories were shut down or the

It would appear that very few p

Compulsory National Service was
introduced i n this country i n 1938, i n
order to increase the size of our f i g h t -
ing forces at a time whan H i t l e r was
threatening the peace i n Europe. How-
ever, i t was continued after the war so
that we oould f u l f i l our commitments to
other countries. Five army d i v i s i o n s
have been kept i n West Germany as part
of N.A. T.O. Only now i s the Govern-
ment ending compulsory c a l l up. The
introduction was f u l l y j u s t i f i e d . b y
the outbreak of war i n September 1939.
It i s the continuation after the war
that i s to be discussed.
Many sohoolboys and undergraduates
think of National Service as a useless
break i n their work and look f o r ways
of avoiding i t . These boys usually t r y
to obtain employment with a firm engaged
i n defence work, and which can offer
them deferment. Some, however, wel-
oome the opportunity to break away
from home and to see the world. Nat-
ional Servicemen fought i n the Korean
War and at Suez. Some have seen
aotion against t e r r o r i s t s i n Kenya,
Malaya or Cyprus.
It i s generally accepted that
the majority enjoy the companionship
during National Service and benefit
from the team s p i r i t and d i s c i p l i n e .
These young men usually leave the
service f o r more mature than when
they joined and are more f i t t e d to
start t h e i r careers i n industry. Some
gain invaluable experience i n the
handling of men. A few, however,
do not f i t i n , f o r they resent author-
i t y and do not l i k e accepting orders.
They usually leave with a stronger
d i s l i k e f o r authority and, unfort-
unately no answer has been found to
their problem.
A f t e r the war, Industry found
that i t was losing i t s s k i l l e d youth
to National Service and that most of
the better school leavers were accepting
employment with firms engaged i n def-
enoe work. An apprentice who had been
taught a craft would be called up f o r
National Service at a time when he could
have started to do useful work f o r his
f i r m . After doing his service he
would not always return to the same firm.
Industry d i s l i k e d t.iis and, i t i s s a i d ,
found ways of gaining deferment f o r i t s
young men whenever possible. however,
i t has now come to be accepted that the
team s p i r i t and d i s c i p l i n e enjoyed by a
youth during his term of National Service
can be of benefit to him and that he may
well be a better worker f o r having
completed i t . The young men who had
been officers during t h e i r National Serv-
i c e were now trained leaders of men.
The Government adopted National
Service to increase the strength of the
Forces, but i t also had to consider the
o v e r a l l efficiency. Much of a Nat-
i o n a l Serviceman'a time i s taken up
by learning a c r a f t . Their training
only becomes of value to the Forces in
an emergency. Training i s given by
regular servicemen, and this causes
a reduction i n the size of the part
of the regular Forces helping to meet
the Country's commitments. For these
reasons National Service results in s
reduction of the o v e r a l l off ioienoy of
the Forces.
The type of young man who makes
the Foroes his career, i s one who taxes
a pride i n belonging to an efficient,
volunteer organisation. National
Service causes a lowering of efficiency
and so r e s u l t s i n a f a l l of regular
recruitment f i g u r e s . This i s indica-
ted by the growing recruitment figures
now that National Service i s to end.
The s p i r i t must improve when everyone
i n the Forces i s making i t his career.
Now that the cold war i s not so
intense, i t has been possible to reduce
our commitments. Forces need no
longer be as large as they were. With
Industry expanding as i t i s , i t is
more important to the country's eooncey
to increase the manpower engaged in
production. The Government hopes that
by doing away with compulsory National
Service, the s i z e and efficiency of
the regular Forces j e i l l increase. It
w i l l then be able to meet a l l i t s
commitments with these regular Foroes,
and by releasing young men from two
years National Service, be able to
increase the production of consumer goods,
