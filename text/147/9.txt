ill the major Colleges and Universit-
ies «f this country belong to the Nat iqnal
Mon of Students, except f o r Imperial
tillage, Kings College and Bangor University
College. The functions of NUS are
do-fold: f i r s t l y , to provide f o r the
upression of the student view-point, and
secondly, to provide f a c i l i t i e s
supplementary to those provided by the
individual student unions.
r Consider the f i r s t of these functions:
tie expression of the strident view-point.
Just aa doctors have a view-point on modio-
li affairs, and teachers a view-point on
education, and boilermakers on b o i l e r
i liking, so I believe students have some
things to say on student a f f a i r s that
n
o
b
o
d
y else oould say or i s l i k e l y t o say.
' Just as a member of any other occupation
redd be irresponsible i f he did not give
I use consideration t o the wider problems
of his or her p a r t i c u l a r organisation,
1101 think that a r e s p o n s i b i l i t y i s shown
h
y those who advocate apathy or disorganis-
ed criticism of student a f f a i r s by students.
It would be a sad day f o r t h i s country i f
ell its students became so irresponsible
that they c^uld not organise an i n s t i t u t i o n
for the reasonable expression of t h e i r
tm view-point.
For many years NUS has had a compre-
hensive policy on student a f f a i r s ,v kept up
to date, and agreed on stage by stage by
its' members, I w i l l quote three examp-
lee from this comprehensive policy. NUS
advocates a central clearing-house f o r
miversity entrance to replace the
present ohaotic scramble from one University
to another without any indication of the
planes available. NUS advocates that
standardised grants should be given autdm-
atically upon an entrant obtaining a
University plaoe. Fpr years i t has been
recommending the a b o l i t i o n of the means-
teet,
NUS has means of making i t s e l f heard
is good as those of any other occupational
organisation. In the House of Commons
there are 5 Vioe-Presidents of NUS: two
Conservative MPs, two Labour MPs and a
liberal MP. Lord Pakenham i s the Vioe-
President representing NUS i n the
louse of Lords. NUS has annual meetings
with the education committees of the
Parliamentary Parties and from time t o
tiae with the M i n i s t e r of Education on
certain specific issues. The Parliamentary
Secretary for Education recently met
jeabers of the NUS Executive to discuss
tlook-grants. Direct oontaot i s maintai-
n
e
d with the l o c a l education authorities,
.'cist standing committees are maintained
with the National Union of Teachers and the
lasooiation of University Teachers. The
University Grants Ccjnmittee maet the NUS
tacutive for a one-day oonferenoe onoe a
year, (When the UGC v i s i t Imperial
College onoe ewery f i v e ygars they meet a
pcup of only f i f t e e n students f o r t h i r t y
•unites). In addition NUS organises the
rritlng of letters t o the press and
representations to other occupational
organisations.
The effects of t h i s work should be
assessed in the same way as f o r any other
occupational organisation. The number of
local education authorities adopting the
national Union's recommendations on
sintenance rates and methods of assessment
rose from 64 i n 1952 to 118 i n 1955, and
it was asked i n 1957 by the Ministry to
submit evidence of student expenditure.
Co, several other ocoasions the Ministry
in requested information" from NUS, apart
from the numerous representations on the
behalf of individual students. In 1955
the Ministry of Pensions t r i e d to levy
f"ational Insurance Contributions at
•self employed' rate ftwa post-graduate
students, but a f t e r refnresentationa by
NUS and NUS alone the matter was dropped.
Lord Pakenham, the Vioe President of the
House of Lords, was able to arrange f o r
a debate on the means-test, and NUS
c a l l e d f o r the support of parents through
a l e t t e r to The Times. NUS has campaigned
against the giving of loans instead of
grants by l o c a l education authorities.
The West Riding of Yorkshire was the l a s t
authority to give up the practice of giving
Icons at Jt interest f o r study purposes
after NUS efforts i n 1957. NUS has fought
foarrthe award of grants to adult stss&tmtfc
with a f a i r measure of success. NUS
a c t i v i t i e s gained the point from the L8IR
that post-graduate grants should be free
of the means-test. There i s a long l i s t
of other instances of the effectiveness of
HDS and I submit that the record of hard
mA and uiiliUiiesiJlT Hr11 bj^NU3 i s out of
n i l proportion to the almost non-existent
efforts of the ICU i n t h i s d i r e c t i o n .
But not only do t d i s l i k e the idea
of ICU oashing in on others' efforts but
I believe that members of ICU would
stand to p r o f i t quite substantially from
the supplementary f a c i l i t i e s offered by
NUS. Let us now consider this second
function of NUS.
On a r r i v i n g at IC new students would
receive a free copy of 'The Students' Guide
to London'. ICU members would be able t o
make use of the NUS Travel Bureau and would
be provided with free information on
foreign t r a v e l on request. They would be
able to participate i n the student charter
f l i g h t scheme. There i s an NUS Hostel i n
Gordon Street. There i s an NUS vacation
work" department, providing information on
non-technical jobs and there are the famous
international farm-camps. An 80-page book-
l e t containing advice on choosing a career
is c i r c u l a t e d free t o f i n a l year students.
IC would be able to enter the NUS drama .
f e s t i v a l and the Observer Mace debating
competition. In addition a number of shops]
and theatres i n the London area give up t o

A s i t Chandmal, who seconded me i n
proposing the motion to a f f i l i a t e to NUS
at the l a s t Union meeting described
himself as 'a rare b i r d : an o r i e n t a l who
i s also a m a t e r i a l i s t ' , and to prove i t he
went on to describe how he had saved £50
by belonging to NUS. I f you vote for ICU
to a f f i l i a t e to NUS at the next Union meet-
ing l/3d of the £6 you pay every year t o
the ICU and the Athletio Ground Committee
w i l l go to NUS. I hope that a l l those
members of the Union who can see a bargain
when i t i s offered w i l l come t o the next
Union meeting to endorse the former decis-
ion f o r ICU to take S*s r i g h t f u l place with
the other 89 Universities, and University
Colleges i n the National...Unian of. Students.

A sudden awareness came over him and
from the dim distance a few words began to
