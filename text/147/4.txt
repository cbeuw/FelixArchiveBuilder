So the third and last term of the
present session has begun, but in the
minds of many brown baggers and Union
Social Butterflies alike i t is an anti-
climax - notable exceptions being the
oar-rival and the Hay ball.
What has caused this not so ob -
vious statement and how will the year
passed be recalled. It was brought .
about by several factors; on the Fields
of Sport 1.0. teams have been invinoible
Although the capture of the mythical
triple orown overshadows a l l , we have
had championship winning teams from
Basketball to Water-polo. Will the
terms past be remembered, on the other
hand, for the N.U.S. controversy whioh
ended in the tragic resignation of the
l.C. president ( Mr. Allen has presented
his views on the matter in this issue).
All these facts have been recorded lo
the annals of the oollege, and only
time will t e l l whioh item will remain.

Dear Sir,
Now that the expansion scheme
is folly underway,might I make a plea
for married quarters in the hostel?
Sinoe I have been at I.C.,1
have been appalled at .the standard of
behaviour among the so-called top % of
the country's youth. The manners of
most students compare unfavourably with
the habits of the domestic pig,and only
after marriage de they appear to become
at a l l civilised.
The presenoe of a number of
married people in the hostel might(I
say might)raise the level of convers-
ation above the bestial trough in whioh
i t wallows and cause some of the sport-
sex-beer maniacs to realise the utter
fatuity of their actions.
At the same time,the sordid
aspect of most hostel rooms might be
alleviated.I have seen conditions whioh
epold be ••fasaaisblj osaaaamted. en in a
fifth-rate doss-house in the vicinity o
of the Elephant and Castle.
Last,but ejertainly not least,
i t could persuade I.C.W.A. that l i f e
does not consist of m»v-ing ooffoe, spr-
eading gossip and fomenting disocrd
among their own sex.
I remain Sir,
Yours Faithfully,
"Betrothed"
(Bte name and address of the anther
of this letter have been witheld for
obvious reasons. Ed. )
bear Sir,
Until now I have refrained from
joining the ever increasing number of
critics of the brown-baggers. For t
h
e
most part, I thought, these student, wn
being unfairly criticised aa they
probably a l l ha* quite acceptable reason
?or their habits.
However, sometime last term I w
a
s
rudely awakened from this illusion by t
»
following incident.
One Wednesday iunoh time, whila M>
ing in the lower refectory I was a littli
annoyed at the non-stop prattle of t
h
e
loudspeakers. They called for support
of the hookey club's oup final match, a;
enticed one to view the excellent p
h
o
t
o
-
graphic society's exhibition in the
oonoert hall, and they persuaded one t
h
a
t
the art olub's exhibition just opened la
the upper lounge, was not to be missed.
How unnecessary, I thought, to keep call-
ing these things out over and over ..gaii,
But then, to my horror, amidst this
noise, one of a pair of students on the J
opposite side of the table from m
e
brought to a halt a discussion on the
intrioacies of a mathematical problea 1
with the words, "Ah well, might as veil j
go back to the lab again - nothing else 1
to do is there?"
Should these two people read this I
plead with them, and to a l l similarly ]
inclined students, to open their ears is)
their eyes. The Union is bubbling owl
with aotivity and offers them opportunlB
unequalled outside student oirolee, 1]
first-class honours degree or a doctors*
is one thing, but an eduoation is anotl*
- why not try for both?
Yours faithfully,

The following letter has been rec-
eived from'The Polyteohnioal Ihstit-
ute, Leningrad.1
Dear S i r ,
At last,after the tedious a
n
d
exalting straggle the pretentions that J
bound the Union as a result of clique ,
rule have been swept away and we are
now fully aware of our position in the
great brotherhood of students. The leo-
is ion to join N.QVS. will be an Inter-
esting one to follow because I for o
n
e
have always been at pains to discover
the the ™ denominator between o
u
r
Union,Croydon Tech. and Ludlow Train-
ing Colleen, Perhaps now the Union fill
be hale to •ocert i t s full, antfcaritr »
t
t
a national level instead of snapping tt .
the heels of the wayward sheep. With tat I
flock we are sure to be lead to great
pastures but perhaps the Union will fafI
i t chilly wham shearing time comes,
I wish our delegates the best !
of good fee-tune at their oonferenoe
They oan be sure that,after a sail;
the national organisation,wo shall be•
than a l i t t l e interested In the results.
I reamIn S i r ,
Yours Faithfully,
John Chsdwiek.
