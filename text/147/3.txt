Last term's choice of play was not a
happy one,but this play was quite a dif
different matter."The Big Knife"as a play
is vary good.It has something to say and
i t says i t in the beat Amerioan manner.
This does not necessarily make a good
play,but Odetta has used his dramatic
craft to good effeot.His use of the
past of the characters(brought up in
the course of conversation)is olever,
as his use of atmosphere. .

e is Successful
in making his characters live and,in
faot,some of them really unpleasant.
In general, the acting was good.
The only cxitiosm I have to offer was

and Carolyn Russell overplayed bewHt
Les Allen was (of course!) exoellent,
and Edward Kattan was very good.
Mike Baron's debut as the most e v i l
character i n the play was excellent.

spite of chaotic organisation Jezebel and
her firemen managed to pass the reviewing
sti-nd twice and reach top gear once.
The following Saturday she took the „
road once again to SilversJone with 1Q
brave passengers f o r the VSCC spring
meeting. The reluctance 'of the exhaust
pipe to remain intact caused great anxiety
and even great noise a l l the way to
Silverstone where successful repairs were
carried o.it i n the paddock. Following an
interesting afternoon's racing the party
invaded the narrow Northants* lanes and,
having wined and dined w e l l , returned
to London i n the usual manner, d r i v i n g on
other people's headlights. In spite of
a l l attempts to the contrary we returned
