w i t h the l.P.T.B. a s a c c e s s o r i e s before and a f t e r
the f a c t .
The n i g h t at H a r l i n g t o n was preceded by a n ICU
g e n e r a l meeting on Hov. 1 s t . , a t which the a r r a n g e -
ments were announced by the P r e s i d e n t , Mr. D.K.
N i c o l a s . ' We were informed t h a t t r o u b l e had been
e x p e r i e n c e d over the f i r i n g o f r o c k e t s and t h a t
t h i s would have t o be done a t a time t o be decided
by the London A i r p o r t ; a l s o t h a t no Very L i g h t s
were t o be used, on P o l i c e and London A i r p o r t i n s t -
r u c t i o n s . However, the meeting had i t s b r i g h t e r
moments, a s when a n e n q u i r e r q u e s t i o n e d whether the
beer was s t r o n g enough t o be able t o stand before

announcement t h a t 'none o f our a i r c r a f t are m i s s i n g
can o n l y be p r o v i s i o n a l a s i t i s belie.ved a number
of r o c k e t s t i c k s have s t i l l t o r e t u r n t o e a r t h , and
may cause unimagineable havoc y e t .
But t h i s was j u s t c h i l d s - p l a y compared w i t h
the dangers on the ground, and i t i s f e a r e d t h a t many
young men found i t necessary t o e x e r c i s e t h e i r p r o -
t e c t i v e powers o n t h e i r companions. Dai-Fawkes, i n
h i s r o b e s , was burnt on h i s death-bed', j u s t by the

metamorphosed s t u d e n t s , w i t h a n a r c h i s t i c g l i n i s i n

Although the f i r e w o r k a i c p l a y ws.s f i n e , and
e v e r y t h i . t , t h a t should have gone o f f , went o f f ,
a l o n ^ w i t h oue t h a t shouldn't, the main a t t r a c t i o n
was unuoubtedly the 'Hop'. The Rugger, Soccer and
Hockey C l u l s made' tv.o r a f f i s h straw guys i n proper
/-.it, oil a backclofch which gave c o n s i d e r a b l e tone t o
the proceedings, to match the I.C.W.A. e f f o r t on the
b o n f i r e guy. The uancing became p r o g r e s s i v e l y more
h i l a r i o u s w i t h an endurance P o l k a and a d i s a s t r o u s
'Hoxy-koky', i n both o f which Jack Howarth managed
s u c c e s s f u l l y t o c o l l a p s e under a p i l e o f shock-happy

are t o be s e v e r e l y c o n g r a t u l a t e d on such a d i s -
t r a c t i n g evening, and we suggest they run a. per-
manent Road House on the Bath Road f o r des-

f i r s t a.n i n c o n v e n i e n t arrangement- became a very
