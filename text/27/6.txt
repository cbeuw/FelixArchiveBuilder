RIDING
Toe. Imperial College Riding Club t o l a
year i s a most f l o u r i s h i n g organisation, there
„„ing at the moment a t o t a l of f i f t e e n members.
This i s a very g r a t i f y i n g state o f a f f a i r s , and,
indeed, i s adequate exemplification o f the
valiant s p i r i t abroad i n I.C. to-day. F o r ,
a f t e r a l l , the horse i s a huge, hard, high,
animal with teeth and hooves that from leading
distance appear o f monstrous proportions.t This,
however, has not daunted the 1951 freshers who
are, for the most part, beginners and nor should
i t , f o r I.Cf. Riding Club has always been proud
Of i t s low death rate.
There appear to be two things which nor-
mally deter beginners from taking up r i d i n g
(apart from lack o f a horse). One i s the
expense o f r i d i n g equipment, the other i s the
small matter of personal comfort. The f i r s t
does not apply since at the I.C. Riding Club
no equipment i s required. Naturally, a stout
p a i r of breeches helps considerably i n the
retention o f one's a b i l i t y to walk but ( l i k e
walking) t h i s i s not e s s e n t i a l . The second?
Well, there i s absolutely no discomfort i n r i d -
ing. The discomfort comes i n learning to r i d e .
And even after one's f i r s t r i d e , a cold bath
and violent exercises f o r three quarters o f an
hour the next morning w i l l leave no after-effects.
Or p r a c t i c a l l y none.
The p e r i o d i c i t y o f rides at the moment i s
phenomenal, the average approaching bi-weekly.
This w i l l not be maintained since as the year
wears on, the imminence of exams and the gene-
r a l downward trend o f bank balances w i l l apply
a glutte brake. Nevertheless, the Riding Club
i s able to o f f e r at frequent i n t e r v a l s a most
pleasant open-air afternoon amid some of the
finest country around London.
Club r i d e s are every Wednesday and S a t u r d a y .

TEAMWORK
The success of a s c h o o l team on a s p o r t s f i e l d
depends t o a g r e a t e x t e n t upon the presence o f only
two p l a y e r s of g r e a t e r than average s t a t u r e , but
not n e c e s s a r i l y of g r e a t e r a b i l i t y ; the c a p t a i n and
v i c e i n the s i x t h , who c o m p l e t e l y dominate the game
between them, a t t a i n i n g h a l f the seasons s c o r e .
jiach year I.C. r e c e i v e ^ i t s quota of these
pigmy g i a n t s each eager to prove h i s a b i l i t y , each
c o n f i d e n t o f r e a c h i n g the f i r s t team the f i r s t week.
Remembering h i s happy unopposed schooldays our
f r e s h e r p l a y s a s e l f i s h game, d i s p l a y s b r i l l i a n t
a r t i s t r y , b a f f l i n g and p a s s i n g h a l f h i s opponents,
o n l y t o l o s e at the c r i t i c a l moment the b a l l which
!
i s promptly sent t o dangerously near h i s own g o a l
l i n e . Slov.ly he r e a l i s e s t h a t what d e f e a t s him each
time i s team work, i n which ea.ch member o f the team
adds h i s share, keeping the b a l l j u s t out o f reach
o f the o p p o s i t i o n , p a s s i n g f^om one t o another ,
u n t i l the breach i n the defence i s wide enough for
another s c o r e .
The success o f I.C. teams i s due t o the practice
,of teamwork, a l t h o u g h s ^ l l far from p e r f e c t , r a t h e r
sooner t h a n most o f their opponents. Each game sees
e l e v e n o r f i f t e e n men, as the case may be, welded
more s o l i d l y t o g e t h e r , each man becoming an integral
:
part of the team, an i n t e l l i g e n t and highly adapt-
able member of a n a t t a c k i n g mechanism. The effect i s
not t o reduce the team,aS'^inay be f e a r e d 4 t o the
m e d i o c r i t y o f the l e a s t a b l e member, but to ensure
a stable and r e l i a b l e support for the greater
dexterity o f the more able members. No individual
play that does not lead to the gain of ground and
foreward motion of the team can be anything but a
(
;
d i s c r e d i t to the performer, and detraction from
enjoyment i n the game. Enjoyment of the game should
ybe before and after a l l , the purpose of playing,
individual fitness and a b i l i t y welded i n teamwork
being the most important means to the end.
