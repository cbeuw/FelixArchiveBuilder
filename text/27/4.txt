Maudheim, 1st October
A f l y i n g c h i p of rock damaged the r i g h t
eye o f the g e o l o g i s t , A l a n Reece, when he was
t a k i n g a sample of the rock on 11th March,
d u r i n g the summer's s l e d g i n g . I met him e i g h t
days l a t e r and examined the eye, but no t r e a t -
ment was p o s s i b l e a t t h a t stage as we were t h r e e
weeks' journey from Maudheim.
When we a r r i v e d at Maudheim on 30th May,
the development of the eye c o n d i t i o n was un-
s a t i s f a c t o r y , so I c o n s u l t e d by w i r e l e s s the
eye s p e c i a l i s t , P r o f e s s o r Sven L a r s s o n , o f Lund,
Sweden, w i t h r e g a r d to treatment. During the
treatment my f e a r s were confirmed t h a t the other
eye was i n grpve danger of becoming a f f e c t e d ,
which would have r e s u l t e d i n t o t a l b l i n d n e s s ;
o n l y the removal of the damaged eye c o u l d save
t h i s . With the p r o f e s s o r ' s a d v i c e I decided to
operate w i t h i n a week.
i had never before performed o r seen such
an o p e r a t i o n , and no one e l s e a t Kaudheim had
had experience of a s s i s t i n g i n an o p e r a t i o n .
I s t a r t e d p r e p a r a t i o n s immediately, i n f o r m i n g
o n l y a few members of my i n t e n t i o n s so as not
to alarm the whole base. The photographer,
S t i g H a l l g r e n , was t h o r o u g h l y i n s t r u c t e d i n the
t e c h n i q u e of i n t r a v e n o u s anaesthesia., and t r a i n e d
h i m s e l f on s e v e r a l members, i n c l u d i n g myself, by
g i v i n g v i t a m i n i n j e c t i o n s . The g e o l o g i s t , Fred
R o o t s , w a s ^ s e l e c t e d to a s s i s t i n the o p e r a t i o n ,
and the g l a c i o l o g i s t , V a l t e r S c h y t t , was taught
the o p e r a t i n g nurse's t a s k of h a n d l i n g the
i n s t r u m e n t t a b l e .
At t h i s s t a g e , Reece was informed t h a t the
o p e r a t i o n was necessary, and gaVe h i s consent,
and i t mas decided t h a t i t s h o u l d take p l a c e
t h r e e days l a t e r . The dog d r i v e r , P e t e r M e l l e b y ,
c o n s t r u c t e d the o p e r a t i o n t a b l e from s l e d g i n g
boxes, and an oxygen mask from spare "weasel"
p a r t s . O p e r a t i o n l i n e n was sewn from s h e e t s ,
and gauze, t o w e l s , l i n e n and instruments were
s t e r i l i z e d . The t e l e g r a p h i s t , E g i l Rogstad,
was i n s t r u c t e d i n t a k i n g b l o o d p r e s s u r e , and
the a s s i s t a n t s were g i v e n a l e s s o n i n s t e r i l i t y
and o p e r a t i n g teamwork.
PREPARING FOR THE OPERATION.
E v e r y t h i n g was i n order on 21st J u l y f o r
the o p e r a t i o n , w i t h almost every f a c i l i t y of
a s m a l l h o s p i t a l , except female nurses. At
2 o ' c l o c k I p u l l e d the g l o v e s on, and w h i l e the
a s s i s t a n t s completed the s t e r i l i t y arrangements
I arranged the instruments on the t a b l e . At
2.45 Reece made an i m p r e s s i v e l y brave entrance,
c l i m b e d the o p e r a t i o n t a b l e and- s a i d : "You
know, I am s c a r e d s t i f f i n s i d e . " I then began
the a d m i n i s t r a t i o n of the i n t r a v e n o u s anaesthe-
t i c . When the p a t i e n t was a s l e e p , H a l l g r e e n
took over w h i l e I changed g l o v e s and prepared
the o p e r a t i n g a r e a .
