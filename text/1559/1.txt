Friday sees the opening of the new h-bar for postgraduates and staff
New postgraduate ħ opens

A
new postgraduate
student and staff
drinking and social
venue on the South
Kensington campus
is set to open this Friday. In keeping
with the Union’s trend of naming
its drinking establishments with
incredibly nerdy puns, the new
space will be called ħ (pronounced
h-bar), named after the reduced
Planck constant, which is the smallest
quantum of angular momentum (with
a value of 6.582 x 10-16 eV s). There
have been some criticisms of the
new name, however according to the
Union the name was chosen out of a
shortlist of names submitted by staff
members and postgraduate students.
The ħ will be a multi-function space,
with a ‘café’ area and a ‘bar’ area.
The bar will be run by the Union,
whilst food is provided by College’s
Campus Services division. The bar
will be staffed by students with
previous bar experience, similar to
the Old Holland Club and will have
several student shift leaders, one of
whom will be Stefan Nubert, former
Deputy President Finance & Services
and current Imperial postgraduate
student. The café area is set to serve
Leon -style street food — think falafel
wraps and couscous — which adds an
exciting variation to College’s current
food provision, while the bar area
will provide pub-style food as well
as sharing platters and tapas-style
dishes. The lunch provided by the
venue will be different from the menu
in the Senior Common Room, with
the added benefit of being accessible
for taught postgraduate students
(unlike the SCR). The bar will serve a
selection of beverages available at the
other Union bars, with the addition
of a new craft beer from Greene King
called “Noble”. There might also be
some promotional deal available later
on in the year.
The Union stated that they were
keen for the space to host postgraduate
student events and welcome student
input while the way in which the
space is used is developed. They are
also keen for postgraduate students to
consider ħ as a “home for postgraduate
students and staff”.
In comparison to the postgraduate
and staff venue that used to exist in the
space (the Holland bar) the ħ provides
a significantly large space for drinking
and eating, utilising more of the
Sherfield building’s basement spaces.
Additionally the availability of food
during lunch hours has the potential
to reduce the stress on the popular
SCR, which currently operates at
full capacity during this period. The
biggest boost to functionality from the
refit is the opening up of the space in
the sub-basement below Sherfield and
ħ. This has created two activity spaces/
meeting rooms for union clubs and
societies, which were in desperately
short supply. Unfortunately this
has come at the expense of the staff
snooker room, but given the desperate
lack of space on campus and the large
snooker room on the top floor of the
Union, this did seem redundant.
