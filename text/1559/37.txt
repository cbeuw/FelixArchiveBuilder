IC Windsurfing give encouraging performance
T
his weekend, Imperial
Windsurfing Club
descended on Cornwall
for Aussie Kiss, the largest
windsurfing festival in
the UK and highlight of the student
windsurfing calendar. With teams
coming from as far as Glasgow, the
pressure was on to make it down in
time for the Friday night party. With
the fastest, most efficient rush hour
avoidance scheme in club history, we
made record time out of London and
were encountering new and exciting
forms of debauchery by midnight.
On Saturday morning, there was a
perfect beginner wind. We sent our
beginners out to join the 156 newbies
hitting the water for the first time,
accompanied by the club instructors
to supervise, for what must be the
biggest mass lesson in the UK!
Following a quick simulator session,
the beginners went out in force
and were soon sailing up and down
brilliantly with only a few tows back
upwind. As the afternoon wore on,
the wind began to build and build. We
rigged our sails and got down to the
beach in short order, with every single
club member making it out onto the
water. Beginner Sam, who headed
straight back out onto the water,
despite the massive wind, to hone his
skills,showedparticularlystrongform.
In the meantime, the intermediates
continued to push themselves, leading
to several rescues and some epic kit
breakages! Exhausted but happy, we
were shooed off the water and headed
back to the campsite.
Once there, the fancy dress madness
began. The overall theme for the party
was Jury Summons as it was AK12.
Having considered and discarded
going as snowmen (“Just ice!”) on the
basis that we’d have been explaining it
all evening, Imperial had shot gunned
the sub-theme of “The Mob” and as
such it was an extremely smart bunch
of trilby-ed, suspendered gangsters
and molls who weaved their way down
to the party. Avoiding the Di-Octo
bong (or not) as character dictated, the
dancing and caravan hopping began
and lasted well into the morning.
By Sunday morning, excitement had
reached fever pitch. The Daily Herald
had informed us that this would be
the windiest day for 25 years (Minibus
master Matt’s mum had texted him
to be careful driving in the gale force
winds) we were ready to hit the lake!
Nursing sore heads, we bossed the
caravan clear up before piling into the
minibus. When we arrived, the gusts
were so strong that you could see
them raising half-foot ripples across
the surface of the lake. Needless to
say, “Doctor Extraordinaire” Tom was
out on the water before we could even
complain about putting on our wet
wetsuits and he proceeded to blister
up and down at the most ferocious
speed while we watched the pros go
from the shore.
Defying the forecast, the wind
calmed a little in time for the racing.
Sadly, it was still too strong for the
beginners to race – a massive pity
as our beginners had shown some
really considerable progress over
the weekend and we had high hopes
of getting some medal winners!
Progressing to the team racing, Tom,
President Sam and first-time racer
Izzy took to the water to show off their
skills. Despite a dramatic beginning
where a cheeky side attack from
Liverpool trapped him downwind,
Sam whipped away, leaving the ex-
Club President (who abandoned us for
Exeter this year) gasping in his wake.
Tom continued in the same vein,
bringing us up to a nail-biting second
place with an awesome plane out and
a clean gybe.
Unfortunately, Izzy was unable to
hold position following an unlucky
gybe and we finished in a still-
respectable fifth place. As the clouds
started to close over, we dragged
Mayliss and Will off the water and
packed up to head home, refreshed
and rejuvenated after a wonderful
weekend away.

Eagles squeak past Royal
Holloway in close game
Stefan Bauer
Handball Secretary
The Imperial Eagles Handball
Club has started their new cam-
paign with a hard-fought victory
over newcomers Royal Holloway
on Saturday, and are now amongst
the favourites to win the first ever
LUSL Handball League.
Over the summer, all London-
based University Handball Clubs
had put a lot of work into a com-
bined LUSL application in order
to play amongst like-minded clubs
and further the whole sports’ ap-
plication to the BUCS network.
Last weekend marked the first
match day of the newly established
LUSL Men’s Handball Division and
Imperial was set to face Royal Hol-
loway for the first time ever.
After a rather long journey to the
SPORTHOUSE in Barking, a ven-
ue that serves as a painful remind-
er of the failure that is the Olympic
Legacy, the Eagles saw their op-
position for the first time and had
to come to the realisation that this
game would not be the push-over
they were expecting for the first
game of the season. What Royal
Holloway was lacking in experi-
ence, they more than compensated
for with individual class. Their
francophone comrades on the left
wing and the right back positions
would prove to be difficult to con-
trol and their counter-attacking
style was very efficient.
From the first attack onwards the
game was very heated and hotly
contested and after 14 minutes
played, the Eagles found them-
selves trailing with 7:4 goals, lead-
ing to the first team time-out. The
opponent’s tactical set-up was ad-
dressed and spirits were rekindled,
which quickly refocused Imperial’s
team and saw them clawing back
goal after goal. Some questionable
refereeing and some sloppy fin-
ishing meant that at half time, the
Eagles found themselves one goal
behind their opponents at 15:14.
After a detailed analysis at half-
time and a change in their defen-
sive set-up, which saw Royal Hol-
loway’s dangerous right-handed
winger cut-off or alternatively the
left-back man marked in order to
slow their attacking waves, Impe-
rial finally found their way into the
game. The goal deficit was quickly
turned into a 2-goal lead and with
Stefan Bauer in goal finally find-
ing his form, Royal Holloway soon
found themselves trailing by 4
goals.
A highly debatable call by the ref-
eree saw Imperials’ David HoSch-
mi sent off with 20minutes to play
and threw the hosts from north
London a life-line. However, unlike
in previous years, the Eagles kept
their cool, continued to be clinical
in front of goal and held on to their
lead. Royal Holloway tried to open
their little box of tricks, but their
attempts to unnerve Imperial were
to no avail. After 60 minutes the
final score was 27:29 for Imperial.
Club President Rishi De-Kayne
was ecstatic after the encounter:
“What an exciting game! This is
why we went through all the trou-
ble of setting up the Uni League. It’s
great to play competitive matches
against teams with the same stand-
ard and mindset. Admittedly, this
was a very close game, but every-
one in the team really worked hard
and stayed focused when it mat-
tered. If we keep playing like this, I
fancy our chances this season.”
