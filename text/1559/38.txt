My First Triathlon: Hever Castle Half-Ironman
I
signed up to do the gauntlet with
Imperial Triathlon Club because
(a) it was half price for students,
and (b) it’s at a castle! I don’t think
it is really the done thing to do a
half ironman as your first triathlon but
I thought it was a great idea because
I would be able to relax and get into
it over the day, rather than be rushing
around in a sprint. It turned out fine
for me, so my first piece of advice is to
recommend doing whatever distance
you like the sound of as your first race.
The Hever Castle Triathlon festival
was alive with over 5,000 competitors
aged between 7 and 70 years old
enjoying a race to complement their
level, from the children’s sprint to the
Gauntlet half ironman, all around the
stunning grounds and countryside.
Theracecoursewaslinedbythousands
of supportive spectators cheering
on everyone taking part. Piece this
together with the live music, food,
castle grounds and entertainment
and you’ve got a killer race day. David
McNamee, ranked 13th in the world,
and Ironman reigning champion, Lucy
Gossage, were the course favourites
on the new half iron distance racing
alongside many first timers and
university teams.
I hadn’t done much training so I was
feeling a bit nervous when my alarm
went off at 5:30am on the morning
of the big day. I clambered out of my
tent and wandered down to transition
and the race briefing with Josh (my
boyfriend and supporter for the day),
Pit Pillatsch, and Nick Brierley (fel-
low members of Imperial Triathlon
Club). After a briefing on safety and
the course it was time to get going.
The mist cleared across the lake
and a hot air balloon rose up over the
course, giving those spectators what
can only be imagined as the prime
race course view.
Close to 300 Gauntlet competitors
entered the water awaiting the cannon
to go off. I said goodbye to Pit and
Nick and as instructed, slid down
the slimy steps on my bum into the
ornamental lake, where you could
actually walk out to the middle on a
carpet of weeds! I made for the start
line, feeling too nervous to be cold,
and positioned myself at the back to
one side of the group because I didn’t
want to be swum over by all the super-
fast swimmers when the gun went off.
As it turned out I spent pretty much
all of the swim trying to pass the
people in front; next time I need to be
Rebecca Rowe gives her account as Imperial record good times against 5000
much more aggressive and sprint off
the front. We first swam in a straight
line out into the lake, and then turned
into a narrow channel for the second
half of the 1.9 km course, through the
River Eden and around the 16-acre
island. The crowd support from the
banks and bridges was amazing and I
was soon being hauled out of the water
and running back towards transition.
Pit had a great swim and was already
in T1 when I got there, simultaneously
encouraging me and getting out on his
bike at lightning speed. I took transi-
tion at a more leisurely pace – I was
fully aware it would be a long day and I
wanted to stay as comfy and relaxed as
possible to make sure I finished. After
15 minutes, an energy bar and a quick
hug from Josh I was on my way to the
90km bike course.
This was the part I was most wor-
ried about, having ridden a road bike
only four times ever before the race I
was definitely venturing into the un-
known here. Within about 5 km I had
already bounced my bike bottle out of
its holder on a pothole leaving me very
thirsty until the first water station at
20 km, where I surprised the volun-
teers by coming to a complete halt to
pick up a new water bottle because I
wasn’t confident enough to do it rid-
ing along like everyone else. It was a
beautiful hilly course with great views
and the weather was perfect so I set-
tled in and really enjoyed it. Towards
the end, the low riding position be-
came very painful to maintain and it
was my back rather than my legs that
thanked me as I finally reached T2
and ran back to my rack, 5 hours after
I had left it.
I only spent 10 minutes in transi-
tion this time, and got out on to the
run feeling good. Maybe I felt a bit too
good as I accidently ran my first mile
in 7 minutes, which is about my 5 km
pace (so it was a good thing I looked
at my watch and slowed down be-
fore I completely destroyed my legs).
From the 4th mile, I had begun walk-
ing about half of each mile depending
where the hills were. The course was
lovely with two castles and lots of nice
gardens and fields so it felt like no time
until I was onto the last 5 km. With the
volunteers shouting great encourage-
ment such as “You look… er… OK!”
and “You’re not last!” I jogged home,
even adding a wobbly sprint finish at
the end to clock 8:26. I was tired, but
I’d had a brilliant day out and I was
thrilled to have finished the course
which was much tougher, and more
scenic than I was expecting.
Pit and Nick both had great races
with 5:20 and 5:44 finishes, not too far
behind the top of the field with even-
tual winner Karl Alexander setting a
time of 04:40:31, and David McNamee
coming on 20 seconds after to take
2nd.

IC 7s steal victory from St George’s
in 6-5 thriller
Julian Iacoponi
7th XI Football Player
On Wednesday 30th October, with
the chill of Halloween whistling
through the drab skies of autumnal
London, the 7s gathered for what
turned out to be, appropriately, a
thriller.
Our journey to the ground
mirrored the match in some
ways, but not in others: a long
time spent on the tram lines
seemed appropriate given the
tennis-like back-and-forth nature
(and indeed score) of the game,
although the number of stops
along that journey did not reflect
the equivalent number achieved by
either defence.
After an unexpectedly
professional warm up – with extra
focus on those key triceps stretches
– the team started strongly, with
Myles Jarvis and Sam ‘Dzeko’
Duffield linking up well in attack.
An unfortunate non-decision
by the referee (who conveniently
was their player) on a clear down-
the-line push on Luke Looney led
to their first attack of the match,
which, after a sloppily missed
tackle, led to the first goal. One-
love St. George’s.
Heads still up, the 7s rallied
and started to move toward
the opposition net with greater
frequency and Phil Gantner
showing his class in midfield.
Great movement from a throw-in
led to a crisp pass from Phil across
the six-yard box for Julian Iacoponi
to place carefully through the legs
of the keeper with a firm side-foot
finish. One-all, no breaks yet.
After a couple of missed
chances, complacency set in
and the opposition began to
dominate proceedings, bouncing
back well. Again, a set of poorly
missed tackles led to a (legitimate
this time) penalty, which the St.
George’s striker aced passed the
palms of 7s keeper Zain ‘Dodgeball’
Abbas. Perhaps such ball-dodging
practice didn’t come in handy in
this situation? A few minutes later,
slack marking off a corner led to
their centre-back – one of those
men who look more at home in a
pub than on a football pitch – who
headed in. At 3-1 for St. George’s,
the 7s needed to buck the trend
and break back.
Some strong tackles by Phil
‘Gersty’ Gerstenberg at right-back
sparked the team back on track:
timing the ball well and challenging
cleanly, with Vivek Dava in midfield
asserting himself on the match. The
ever-reliable Phil Gantner struck a
lovely through-ball to Myles Jarvis’
piercing cross-pitch run, which
was followed by a slotted finish. 3-2
down at halftime, we had broken
back and were eager to serve up
that equaliser, and then some.
At the change of ends – all triceps
crucially still intact – player-
manager-captain Jamie Goodier,
who was just a piece of chewing
gum away from emulating the
classic SAF look, sporting a thick
black coat; made no substitutions,
with the only change coming in the
referee position- a role appointed
to a reluctant but gallant Rob ‘The
Fresher’ Harris.
The second period frenzied
into an abuse-gargling affair;
treacherous tackles teetering
on the terminal were scattered
from the two teams, elevating the
temperature of this testing tête-
à-tête from moderate to intense.
Sebastian Gosden certainly
deserves acclaim for his positively
Etonian attitude to abuse he
received as linesman: “Please
gentlemen, you’re all simply
embarrassing yourselves” – indeed
it could not have been phrased
more elegantly.
Almost every decision caused
controversy, with St. George’s
feeling ‘robbed’ by the referee
when a penalty was awarded –
legitimately – for handball off an
attacking Luke Looney header, a
great spot by the hawkeyed fresher.
Myles Jarvis stepped up to take it,
but after sliding the ball weakly
toward the middle of the goal… he
scored. As previously mentioned,
there were indeed very few stops in
this game.
Three-all, the game back on
serve, we began to serve up some
improved football ourselves. Matt
Taylor moving into centre-back
provided stability. A slick one-
two move between Dzeko and
Julian sliced open the St. George’s
defence, with a Van Persie-esque
left foot boom into the near top
corner from the 4th team first-year
banking the seventh goal, ever-
crucial in any football match as
every fan must know.
4-3 up and with Matt Taylor
moving into the referee position,
the 7’s standard dropped again,
with the sloppiness from early in the
first half returning. A couple of close
calls in defence, including a goal-line
block from Kingson Opasina, only
delayed the inevitable St. George’s
equaliser.
At 4-4, the game again turned,
with its end-to-end nature almost
ironically not actually coming to an
end. A cleanly struck ball from Julian
into the feet of Myles resulted in a
slow toe-poke attempt toward the
goalkeeper. Vitally, this shot was at
least on target, and with the keeper’s
attempt at a save horrifically feeble,
it trickled in. Trick or treat? This was
certainly a treat.
The standard again fell from the
7s, with the opposition’s best player
taking matters into his own hands
(or should I say feet?). Their stellar
no.4 ran around four less stellar 7s,
and scored with a cultured cross-
goal finish. Five-all- this match
needed a tiebreaker.
With the game deteriorating
in quality faster than a Kingson
100m, Myles again stepped up after
some neat interplay with Julian
on the left wing and provided a
threatening cross toward the back
post. A looming Luke Looney, who
laboured nobly all game, launched
himself towards the ball and lashed
the header towards goal. The lax
goalkeeper had little hope as he
gropedattheair,leavingtheballlying
in the net and the 7s in the driver’s
seat (despite not actually having
a qualified minibus driver). With
the score at 6-5, and the tiebreaker
swinging our way, the final whistle
blew. Game, set and match.
All triceps still nice and limber, we
shook hands with the opposition,
and thanked the numerous referees.
A hard fought war of a game
behind us, Nandos and ACC night
awaited to reward the battle-weary
#SocialSevens. Peace out.
