FRIDAY 08 NOV
MUSIC
Dealing Conversation a Falco-n Punch
Stuart Masson talks to Future Of The left guitarist ‘Falco’
uture of the Left released
their latest album, How
to Stop Your Brain in an
Accident, last week and
they are currently touring
the UK, visiting London on
the 13th. Stuart Masson caught up
with lead singer and guitarist Andrew
‘Falco’ Falkous.
For starters, can you give a quick
description of Future of the Left for
those who haven’t listened to you
before?
Just a loud rock band who want
to play music which is 8% louder than
most other stuff you’ve heard but still
has melody in it and isn’t shit.
The new album was funded by fan
donations on pledge music, did that
affect the album making process?
It affected it, yes, in the way that
it gave us the money to do the record.
It was fantastic to have that money up
front and know we weren’t going to
be scraping around on credit cards or
whatever. It made it easier and more
fun and it meant that the recording,
for once, was a week in the studio
followed by a few days mixing. When
we’ve recorded in the past it’s been
broken up into weekends or single
days, just whenever we’ve had the
times off week. There was a certain
comfort that allowed us to focus and
really get into it.
You reached your target amount in
just 5 hours. Did it feel satisfying
to know you’ve cultivated such a
dedicated fanbase?
Yeah, it was really exciting on one
level, but obviously you don’t want
to see the whole enterprise purely in
financial terms but just as a show of
faith it was quite lovely. I would say it
was quite a heartwarming experience.
A lot of the business experience of
being in a band, and it’s increasingly
a business, is cold and lonely and
depressing. So even though it was
something that was just a headlines
day, and a lot of the work began from
that point, it was still lovely. As much
as it sounds false, I will never forget it,
genuinely very exciting.
What prompted the decision to
have the whole album streaming in
advance of its release date?
It’s a question of publicity and
also because we had some production
problems with the CD production.
Unfortunately I can’t go into that
because of legal reasons, I’d love to go
into that, because I love to pick a fight,
it’s one of my favourite things to do. It
became a question of the fact that the
album wouldn’t be available until the
28th rather than the 21st so if people
were going to be talking about the
record, we wanted them to be talking
about the actual songs, not the fact it
was going to be delayed.
F
You’ve come out in the past and
vilified file sharing. What was the
story there?
I think it’s important in terms of
the blog post I wrote when our album
leaked two and a half months early
a few years ago, that was specifically
about leaks as opposed to file sharing.
I’m not the hugest fan of file sharing,
I don’t know many self-respecting
musicians who are, although some
people have convinced themselves
that they are. Leaks are a different
thing, especially when they happen
so early, because people have got into
your record, extracted the fat and
protein, and moved onto something
else, even if they’ve really enjoyed it, a
month before your record even exists
tangibly. Also, when you release an
album, you want a sense of occasion, I
wouldn’t go as far as to say a party, but
you want it to certainly be an event
in your life. When it’s been leaked so
early, when it is eventually released,
it’s just apologetically farted out into
the world.
How did you come up with the voice
in Singing of the Bonesaws?
I don’t honestly know. Maybe
I hadn’t had enough oxygen to my
brain that day. I was listening to the
end of the first test between England
and Australia in the middle of doing
vocal takes and I was a bit nervous,
so maybe something in me decided
to become really English as a coping
mechanism.
Your lyrics are often highly surreal
and amusing. What is your writing
process?
In general, the lyrics are usually
just thrown together at the last
moment. Sometimes, when they are
thrown together at the last moment
they don’t work, and they’re the songs
that nobody ends up hearing. More
often than not I think it’s really helpful
to the creative process to have some
pressure. We’ve finished recording
for the day, everybody else is having
dinner, you’ve got an hour to write
two songs, go. That kind of situation
brings out the best in me.
You made the unusual decision to
release an EP, Human Death, at the
same time as the album. How did
that come about?
We just wrote a lot of songs that
we really loved which weren’t maybe
as focused as the record. We definitely
don’t see them as b-sides, in any sense.
We see them as being part of a slightly
more considered musical approach.
For example, in the case of Fucked Up
Runners, that was kind of our jokey,
very self-conscious attempt at doing
a song with a kind of Shellac-y guitar
sound. To us, if that had ended up
on the problem album, it would have
sounded too much like a pastiche.
Are you looking forward to getting
back on the road and touring the
new album?
I am, especially if my back gets
better, because I’ve been in agony for
the last few weeks. I went to see an
osteopath this morning, so if I can
stand up straight, I will enjoy touring a
lot more. Although I feel lucky to have
a job and earn some money, nothing
comes close to playing rock n roll.
You’re well known for your on stage
rants and putting hecklers down. Is
this something you plan or does it
come out naturally when you’re on
stage?
When I started playing, I didn’t say
anything in between songs because I
didn’t know what to say and also,
when nobody knows who you are,
what’s the fucking point in talking?
There was maybe a time, when Kelson
was in the band as well, when perhaps
the talking and people talking back at
us from the crowd got a bit too much.
There’s a balance to be drawn. You
need to remember it is about the rock.
There’s some genuinely funny people
who come to see us, but sometimes
you just find people who know the
reputation of the band and just want
to be arseholes and make the show
about them. If that happens, we just
get them fucking chucked out.
