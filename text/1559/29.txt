STOIC shorts
Peter Brook
STOIC Secretary
STOIC (Student Television of
Imperial College) is revving up for
another year: we’ve got a smorgasbord
of short film scripts in the works, but
the thing that is going to really kick off
the creative side of things will be the
48 Hours Film Competition. It will be
a collaboration between STOIC and
DramSoc, the perfect combination of
filmmakers raring to write and shoot
and a troop of actors fresh out of
screen acting workshops.
This competition is set on the
common ‘you have a weekend, you
have a camera and somewhere to edit,
now GO!’ formula. It’s an opportunity
for everyone to see a part of the
movie making process, and chance
for people who have experience in the
technical and creative sides to share
their abilities and teach people in a
way that means you make something
pretty cool at the same time.
Over the weekend we expect little
sleep, panicked location hunting and
lots of last minuteness, however this
will all be tempered by the fact that
we’ll be making a few awesome, funny,
clever – and possibly a bit silly – short
films.
If you are interested in acting,
directing, writing, cinematography,
scoring music, recording voice,
lighting, editing , colour grading,
producing, foley artistry, special
effects, set design, costume design,
visual effects or focus pulling (you get
the point) this is the competition to
sign up to and STOIC is the society
for you.
The competition is being run from
19:30 Friday 8th Novemeber – 19:30
10th November and teams decided
on at 19:30 in the STOIC studio. The
finished products will be on youtube.

Show Review:
Stuart’s Deep Bath
Listen back at:
icradio.com/shows/stuartsbath
Normally water shouldn’t be anywhere
near your radio, but let Stuart take
the risk by settling into his bath of
tunes, not as weird as you’d think.
Combining indie pop, dream pop and
ambient music, Stuart and Lee create
a show of music you may not have
heard of, but you wish you had done
and can’t imagine how you hadn’t.
Music includes, ‘The Last Minute’ by
Josephine and Elliot Smith.
