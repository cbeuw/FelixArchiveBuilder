Small, Medium, Large –
What size is right for you?
N
o, we are not talking
about T shirts or even
skinny lattes; this
is about the size of
company you work for.
It is all too easy to find yourself only
considering the major multinationals
as potential employers. This is partly
because they recruit in volume and
as a result have budgets to spend on
marketing their opportunities and
raising their profile on campus. But
they are not the only option and in fact
the data shows that, nationally, more
graduates obtain their first job with an
SME than with a major corporate. So
let’s investigate the pros and cons of
what might be right for you.
What do we mean by an SME?
In a recent survey of undergraduates
36% of UK students reported that they
did not know what an SME was. There
is some debate about what constitutes
an SME and the definition varies
across countries and continents but
general in Europe the three broad
parameters can be defined as:
• Micro-entities are
companies with up to 10 employees
(often but not always Start-Ups)
• Small companies with up to
50 workers
• Medium-sized companies
have up to 250 employees.
The Association of Graduate
Recruiters (AGR) annual survey of
graduate vacancies typically estimated
approximately 20,000 opportunities
provided by AGR member companies.
These are mainly, although not
exclusively large employers who
recruit in volume so there is a big
gap between this and the number
of graduates each year. Out of the
300,000 or so undergraduate students
who graduate in the UK each year
only about 10% will obtain work in a
FTSE100 company so it makes sense to
assume that many more graduates are
finding work in smaller organisations.
Working for an SME - the
Pros?
SMEs often work on a different
recruitment cycle to large corporates.
It is more common for them to
recruit on an ‘as required’ basis so
opportunities can appear throughout
the year with more immediate
start times. This is a benefit for
those who wish to delay their job
hunting until the spring or summer
when many of the deadlines have
passed for larger companies. SMEs
may have a structured application
process but often they are open to
a direct speculative approach too.
This can work particularly well for
those interested in internships. Also
SMEs are perhaps more open to
internship applications from earlier
year groups and not always restricting
opportunities to penultimate year
students.
Because SMEs have fewer
employees you can expect to work in a
close knit, perhaps more collaborative
environment with possibly more
access to senior management than in
larger organisations as it is common
for managers in smaller companies
to be more involved in the day to
day operation of the company. You
may find a more open and supportive
atmosphere with less hierarchy. In a
smallerorganisationyourcontribution
may be much more visible which can
allow you to feel a greater sense of
achievement and recognition of your
work, helping you feel more engaged
with the aims of the company. Smaller
organisations may also provide a
more flexible working environment
with opportunities to work across
different projects and to determine
your trajectory within the company.
The companies tend by their nature
to be more agile and fast moving and
so can be a great experience in fast
tracking your career but you need to
develop resilience and self-confidence
to ensure that you keep up and seize
the benefits.
But what are the cons?
The slightly less formal structure
might not suit everyone. If you
are hoping for a well-defined role
and clear cut route for your career
then an SME might not suit you.
Unlike larger companies who recruit
substantial cohorts of graduates at
one time you may find you are the
only new graduate working for a
small company. As such it will be up
to you to establish yourself and plan
for your training and development
in a more proactive way than on an
established graduate scheme. This
does not mean that you will not get
the support you need and in fact it
might be more personally tailored but
there is no doubt that you will have to
take more responsibility for making
the most of any opportunities. Unlike
larger graduate schemes where you
may well have set rotations around
different departments and your
experience determined for the first
one to two years in an SME it will be
more likely that you need to network
with colleagues to gain opportunities
to develop your experience. This
approach suits some but not all so
think through what you will be most
comfortable with.
Another slight downside is that
smaller companies are more likely to
have a less structured salary package
so again you may need to take the
initiative in establishing how and
when your pay will be reviewed. If
you prove your worth and have the
confidence then this need not be a
disadvantage and in fact could lead to
bigger earnings in the long run.
How do you find the
companies?
SMEs are far less likely to make a
splash on campus but they are there
and just take a little more effort to
seek out. Even at the big careers
fairs you will be surprised how many
of the companies attending fall into
the SME category, particularly in
the Technology sector where SMEs
abound. JobsLive is a good starting
point where more than half of the
7300 companies registered employ
less than 250 staff and just over 3000
have under fifty employees.
There are also two useful sections
on the Careers Service website on
how to research companies and links
to resources:

weblinks/researchjobs/companies
What about Start Ups?
Start Ups by definition tend to
be small businesses. Some remain
small and some grow into giants and
many familiar names have followed
this trajectory in recent years. Start
Ups can be a great experience for
some but they are possibly not for
the risk averse among us. If you
are interested in developing your
entrepreneurial skills and learning
how a business develops then being
in at the start with a company can
be hugely rewarding. Consider what
you have to offer a Start Up company.
Is it business acumen, technical
knowledge, a specific practical skill
or work experience background? Also
think through what they have to offer
you in terms of career development,
skills and knowledge enhancement
and reward. Be cautious of the Equity
Share only offer with no basic salary.
This is common among Start Ups and
is a particularly risky proposition. You
may feel that it is worth the gamble
and of course for some the rewards in
the long run can be fantastic but also
consider the percentage of small Start
Ups who do not survive into their
second or third year. It is perhaps
safer to negotiate at least a small basic
salary along with some potential for
shared equity in the longer term. Each
year nationally about 4.5% of new
graduates set up their own businesses
immediately after graduation. This
is a relatively small percentage and
possibly reflects the fact that although
many graduates harbour the thought
of being their own boss most feel it
is safer to gain some experience of
the business world at someone else’s
expense first before launching into
self-employment. Getting involved
in business competitions and
entrepreneurial student challenges is
a good way to test out your aptitude
for developing a business. Details of
business challenges notified to us at
Imperial can be found at:

competitions
Some challenges may also be notified
direct to your department. As part
of our Wednesday afternoon skills
sessions we also run employer led
business games which can help
develop your skills. Details can be
found on JobsLive.
