that old indestructible Nokia that
you used to use? Exactly! Nowa-
days you can’t wait to throw that
one year old trash out, to get the
absolutely newest piece of tech.
Afraid of having to actually talk to
people, but still in need of not feel-
ing so alone in the world? Then you
are not the only one at imperial!
Enter the smartphone. Snapchat,
iMessage, Facebook messenger,
among many others, have circum-
vented the actual need to look into
someone’s eyes, while still allow-
ing you to fulfil your daily commu-
nication quota. This easy road has
manifested itself in more and more
ridiculous ways. Smartphones are
banned from dinner tables, which
then feature stony silence. Groups
of friends will often be seen all star-
ing at their smartphones instead
of actually having fun. Surely soon
enough any form of communication
will be replaced by a 4-5 inch screen.
you a grainy picture of themselves
butt-naked, but all in all this is a
newer phenomenon. Yet not many
are aware of the dangers that can
happen when you send something
so private to anyone, so beware!
Wen u abbreviate everythin it aint
hard 2 understand that spelling skills
are fading, innit? Well after you read
through that cancer-inducing sen-
tences, consider the impact that text
speak is having on English. Textspeak
is endemic in todays youth. Some of
these even use textspeak for official
documents and emails. Yes you may
argue it is faster to use, and quicker
to read. However when you look at
all the beauty that the English lan-
guage possesses, and then imagine it
all written in numbers, single letters
and completely wrong spelling its
enough to really become depressed.
Since your smartphone becomes
obsolete every year, it is not hard to
imagine why people in general tend
to update theirs on an almost an-
nual basis. However this lies in stark
contrast to the time when durabil-
ity and longevity of a gadget were
prized, and the affection that grew
towards something that you used
over the years. I mean remember
A
fter last weeks Osama
Awara’s “10 things
the Internet has
slaughtered”, I decided
to write something
in a similar vein, except of course
exchanging one vital invention
(internet) of our lives for something
equally important (smartphones). So
here goes (in no particular order).
Apart from a few notable exceptions
(I am looking at you Pokémon),
smartphone gaming has dominated
this market. It has lead to the decline
of Sony’s PSP line, as well as curb-
ing any future dedicated consoles
that may have arisen. I mean, why
shell out several hundred pounds on
something that can only play games
that also cost 30-40 pounds a pop,
when you could use that handy tel-
ephone of yours, spend 5 quid and
get the same amount of pleasure.
In fact some people suspect smart-
phones will have a bigger impact
on the gaming industry as a whole!
With everything that these little
wonder machines have to offer right
at your fingertips, some people find
it hard to keep their instant gratifica-
tion monkey in check. Want to check
that hilarious YouTube video in the
middle of a lecture? Sure go ahead!
Want to buy something on amazon?
Go ahead, your smartphone can do
it! In fact smartphones have man-
aged to kill this off so well, that some
people can’t even control themselves
longer than 5 minutes, without
compulsively checking their phone.
These little gadgets were the bee's
knees back in the day, ready to on
one hand wow your friends with awe-
some tracks that you never listened
to, and on the other croon to you on
the bus with the tracks that absolute-
ly embarrassed you. However with
the advent of the smartphone, the
device that could do all of the above
AND make phone calls, the future of
the one-track gadgets was doomed.
Why wait when everything is just
right in your pocket? What is the
point of waiting to see a message,
email or tweet when you could see
your messages within a matter of
seconds? In fact why doesn't eve-
ryone answer right away? With the
advent of smartphones and constant
availability, any need to wait neces-
sary or unnecessary is questioned.
Kind of obvious isn’t it? Why have a
boring old feature phone (you know
those ancient things that have physi-
cal keys) when you could have a su-
per-duper awesome califragilisticex-
pialidocious smartphone that does
everything you could ever imagine?!?
In the past portraits were reserved for
the rich and wealthy. Even with the
invention of cameras, people would
not have wasted their money, time
or film (hopefully) on taking a selfie.
However with the ease of snapping
a quick pic introduced by smart-
phones, this inhibition of blatant
self-love has been eroded. Nowadays
you can't escape the outstretched
arm and pouty lips/tensed muscles
that accompany many a selfie on
any social media sites that you visit.
Come on, lets face it, how many of
you never attempted to sext with
someone? Yeah I thought so. The
promised instant gratification, and
assurances of deleted messages have
all to often led some of us astray.
However before the dawn of the
smartphone, sexting was almost un-
heard of. Yes once in a while you did
get that pervert who tried to send
