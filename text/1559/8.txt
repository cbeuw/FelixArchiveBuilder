Piracy and the need to tackle it

P
iracy grips the public
imagination. Witness
the success of “Captain
Phillips”, a film in which
a vessel captained by
the actor Tom Hanks is hijacked by
Somalis. Somali pirate operations
have been a major threat to ships in
the Gulf of Aden and those bypassing
the Indian Ocean. Yet the pirate
modus operandi is far from clear
to intelligence agencies. In order
to contain their activities many
organizations have come together to
understand their funding operations.
Reports have it that between $339m
and $413m was paid in ransoms off
the Somali coast between 2005 and
2012. Ordinary pirates usually get
$30,000-75,000 each, with a bonus
of up to $10,000 for the first man to
board a ship and for those bringing
their own weapon or ladder.
Qat, a narcotic plant that is chewed
by many, is often provided to pirates
on credit during an operation.
Traditionally used in the same way
as coffee - to assist social gatherings,
meetings and ceremonies such as
weddings - the stimulant qat, like
coffee, is widely believed to have
originated from Ethiopia. And, just as
coffee was criticized and even banned
in parts of Africa during the 16th
century, so the mildly narcotic khat
has recently found itself at the center
of a moral debate. Islamic rulers in
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia,
recently banned use of the drug. This
led Kenya, Somalia’s biggest supplier,
to stop all flights to its neighbor,
sparking street protests in Mogadishu,
and triggering concern among qat
growers and traders in Kenya, who saw
exports drop by 40 per cent. In Kenya,
qat has semi-legal status, but this has
not stopped farmers from cultivating
the crop. In fact, qat cultivation is
currently expanding into new areas,
such as Embu and Nyeri, outside the
traditional growing area of Meru, near
Mount Kenya.
Depending on personal
consumption of qat, pirates receive
the pending sum upon successful
completion of their mission. Some
pirates find it difficult to retire
because they end up in debt at the
end of a hijack. Part of the ransom
money flows to local communities
that provide services to pirates. Al
Shabaab, a terrorist group that wields
enormous power in the area also
The situation in Iraq after the war with US
E
ver since the US troops were
withdrawn from Iraq in
2011, there has been little
international coverage about
the situation in Iraq. Iraq is
in a state of dysfunctional governance
and civil strife. This has caused the
present Prime Minister, Nuri Al-
Maliki, to ask for military assistance
from the US.
ON March 7, 2010, the people
came out in large numbers to vote
in the national legislative election.
The credibility of the elections
became questionable by the
disqualification of 500 candidates by
the Supreme National Commission
of Accountability and Justice due to
their alleged links to the Ba’ath Party,
the party to which Saddam Hussein
belonged. In November 2010, a
coalition formed between all the major
political factions, which resulted in a
political vacuum. This allowed armed
groups to assert themselves in various
areas.
There is currently a security failure
in Iraq. Since there is no interior
or defense minister in Iraq, both of
these tasks are managed by Al-Maliki.
In cities across Iraq where there is a
predominant presence of the Sunni
minority, Maliki’s troops lead by the
Shiite majority has had to withdraw.
Whilst in other places the troops have
had to face desertion, which may be
caused by the forces’ local alliance.
Furthermore, the security forces have
had to withdraw from key towns in
Anbar and from a mainly Sunni area
in the neighborhood province of
Salheddin.
About 500 Iraqis have been killed
since April of this year by Sunni
insurgents who have been bombing
and attacking the Shiite majority. A
large number of these insurgents have
been infiltrating from neighboring
Syria, which is itself facing a severe
civil war of its own. A number of
these forces are also home grown with
their allegiance with Al Qaeda. ISIS
(Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is one
of the most active insurgent group
in the country. Apart from opposing
the Shiite led security groups, these
insurgent groups also attack Sunni
militias which were previously
opposed to Al-Qaeda and were
known as the Sahwa, or awakening,
supported by the US troops during
their operation in 2007.
The government forces tend to take
refuge in barracks as they are unwilling
to conduct patrols on the streets. This

demands a chunk of the proceeds of
a hijack from ordinary pirates. The
daily supplies and mobile network
are sold off to them at inflated rates.
Financing comes from former police
and military officers or civil servants,
qat dealers, fishermen and former
pirates. They take anywhere between
30% and 75% of the ransom. A typical
operation has three to five investors.
Some financiers, especially those in
the Somali diaspora who have little
cash inside Somalia but large deposits
abroad, employ what the report
describes as “trade-based money-
laundering” to send funds to Somalia.
In order to contain pirate activity
in the area, a number of measures
need to the taken. It turns out
that government policies are not
particularly favorable for setting up
private enterprise that would lead to
job creations. The involvement of ex-
government officials further worsens
the situation.
As long as government support to
pirate financers is not severed, ship
hijacks would continue to flourish.
Money laundering has enabled the
swift execution of a number of these
ghastly acts. Somalis residing in UAE,
Kenya and Djibouti are believed to
be the main beneficiaries of the loot.
If current sources are identified and
held punishable, it could serve as a
deterrent to nouveau financers.
Kenya has long been the chief
provider of qat to east African nations.
Many more are now turning to qat,
which is not only easier to grow, but
can be harvested twice a year and
brings in an inwcome that is five times
higher than coffee. The trade has
greatly contributed to development in
the district of Meru, and local farmers
are calling for the status of qat to be
formalized. Qat-chewing is big (and
generally legal) business in much of
the region, and the role of Somalis in
distributing it is growing. The lack of
transparency or monitoring of the qat
trade in Kenya, the main supplier to
Somalia, makes it susceptible to crime.
In such an atmosphere, conventional
measures are rendered inefficacious.
True that one man’s trash is another
man’s treasure.
civilians, which has further angered
the Sunni minority. Not only is there
anger against the heavy handedness
of the government forces but also
due to the failure of the government
to do something for its citizens. The
government is dysfunctional and
unable to pass important legislation.
There is also rampant corruption and
a lack of electricity, which further
adds to the people’s grievances.
Nuri Al-Maliki has now asked the
US for military assistance to fight
the insurgents. The demands include
a request for an apache helicopter
and drones amongst other military
equipment. Tehran tends to emphasis
that Al Qaeda is a common threat to
everyone. In return for US support,
Al- Maliki offers to negotiate with
Iran over cutting down on their
nuclear program. Although Tehran
and Baghdad have got increasingly
close, holding talks with the Iranian
government is unlikely to reap any
fruitful rewards.
Obama is also unlikely to be able to
meet all of Al Maliki’s demands for a
variety of reasons. Firstly, helicopters
and F16 fighter jets are of little use
against insurgents. Furthermore, Al-
Maliki’s government has not been
able to be inclusive of all the minority
groups. Many US Senators feel that
Al-Maliki should not be supported
until he shares power with the
Kurdish and Sunni minority groups.
If the government does not include
minority groups, it will continue
to lack support and resultantly the
insurgent forces will remain strong.
Al-Maliki’s support of Basher Al-
Assad is also unlikely to gain him any
support from US senators.
After years of rule by Saddam
Hussein, Iraq is finding increasingly
hard to transition to democracy.
After the Iraq war, the country lacked
resources to rebuild itself as a nation
and as a result the divisions between
the various groups have grown
stronger.
Nuri Al-Maliki needs to hold more
talks with the various minority groups
and show that he is more inclusive
before he asks for aid from foreign
nations. It will be interesting to see
how the situation plays out.
