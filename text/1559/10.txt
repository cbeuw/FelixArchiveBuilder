Fracking Versus Science Communication
T
he word ‘fracking’ has
become aligned with
unconditional taboo in
the United Kingdom in a
two year interval. Strong
public scepticism has been fuelled by
the parade of paraphernalia arriving
from the USA. Images ranging from
flaming taps right through to ominous
‘frack pads’ litter the internet. In the
summer of 2013 protestors took
to the streets at the G8 Summit in
Fermanagh. Balcombe became the
focal point in the notorious Cuadrilla
row, exhibiting some of the most
vitriolic resistance.
While there may be fundamental
ethical and environmental questions
to be addressed in context of the
wider fracking debate the sporadic
sensationalism of many individuals
and parties ought to be condemned.
Credence must also be conceded to
empirical analyses and research into
the practice.
It must be highlighted that the
process of hydraulic fracturing
has been carried out on a number
of occasions prior to the 2011
Blackpool ‘Earthquake’. Nodding
donkeys (remnant equipment from
fracking processes) pepper the fields
surrounding the Gainsborough
and Beckenham communities.
Fracking has been carried out as far
back as 1969. It must be noted that
controversial ‘shale’ fracking did not
take place in this instance. In spite
of this, the case study highlights the
dangers associated with the selective
implementation of statistics employed
by certain media outlets. This
creates an exploitative smokescreen,
especially on internet search engines,
thus masking the truth by crowding
it in skewed hysteria. Public opinion
is confined to a fabricated status quo
and the problem becomes a self-
exciting perpetuity.
The UK debate can be realigned
through the clarified efforts of
science communication. A 2013 BBC
documentary entitled ‘Fracking: The
New Energy Rush’ and presented
by Professor Iain Stewart of the
University of Plymouth demonstrated
that the fracking debate, despite the
schism in public opinion, contains
many other dimensions that could
shift the balance of debate to the
underlying science. The documentary
drew inferences from the USA.
States like North Dakota typify
exponential growth in the fracking
industry. It has provided the country
withanunprecedentedsenseof‘energy
security’ through a liberal supply of
domestic gas. It has boosted exports
of American coal. The other side of
the phenomenon is the myriad of
construction, deforestation, increased
emissions and noise pollution. The
crux of American opposition centres
on civilian health within areas of
industrial development. Many also
question the consequences for the
water table, the integrity of agriculture
and biodiversity.
It is clear that the priorities of
the American fracking industry
cluster around the economics (Many
middle men and landowners have
accumulated small fortunes) . The
industry has developed without
sufficient regulation. One might infer
that the physical process of hydraulic
fracturing is misconstrued as the evil
entity. In actuality it is the supporting
framework of policy, business and
commercialism that generates the
imperfection.
The UK could learn from these
mistakes. First and foremost,
the process of fracking requires
exceptionallyhighpressurestofracture
rock. By its very nature it demands
diligence, focus and time. A mediated,
reduced rate of production from shale
fracking could minimise unnecessary
damage to surrounding bedrock and
reduce the (still vague) environmental
hazards. It could unify the disparity
between pragmatism and economics
by encouraging a more relaxed and
(crucially) localised energy market.
Secondly, this could engender an ethos
of openness surrounding the practice.
In the United States many companies
champion injunctions, concealing the
composition of their fracking fluids.
While this is favourable for business in
context of an aggressively competitive
A
t least 120 Tibetans
have set themselves
alight in protest against
Chinese rule since
2009. It’s the only
peaceful way they’ve been able to
broadcast their recurrent message:
Save Tibet. It seems that their message
has fallen on deaf ears. When you ask
most people what they know about
Tibet common answers would be “it’s
part of China isn’t it?”, or “it’s where
the Dalai Lama lives…” Whilst the
second answer is significantly wrong
and the Dalai Lama has been in exile
since 1952 the first answer, though
technically correct, completely
undermines and puts into perspective
Tibet’s efforts to fight peacefully for
independence for over 50 years.
So what is Tibet? Tibet is situated
in the western part of China, on the
Tibetan plateau, encompassing ¼ of
Chinese landmass which, including
traditional Tibetan provinces, have
been gradually assimilated into the
Sichuan and Qinghai regions. Now
known as the Tibet Autonomous
Region (though it holds no real
autonomy from Beijing) TAR has
a population of around 6 million
Tibetans and over 7 million Chinese
who, following occupation in 1952,
have been forcefully relocated to
Tibet, making Tibetans the minority
population in their own land. Prior
to its occupation it was a historically
and politically independent country
with its own language, alphabet
(both of which hold no similarities to
Chinese Mandarin), distinct culture
and religion (Tibetan Buddhism).
H.H. Dalai Lama is the spiritual and
political head of Tibet,giving you an
idea of the values that the Tibetan
nation holds.
It is a nation that, due to its
pacifist policies, had no power to
withstand an occupation. It has a
unique culture preserved within
the heights of the Himalaya and
remained untouched until Chinese
occupation. Ever since its days of
peaceful Buddhist practice Tibet’s
situation has gravely changed. Human
rights have failed, Tibet’s culture
and religious practices have been
heavily oppressed. Environmental
destruction as a consequence of
burgeoning infastructure in Tibet
(adhering to China’s energy needs)
are endangering Tibet’s fragile
environment. According to NGO
‘Friends of Tibet’ the ingidenous
population has dramatically declined.
Monasteries have been destroyed,
especially in Lhasa, obstructed by new
buildings, plastic palm trees (I kid you
not) and plans of an airport. Monks
have been imprisoned (the majority
of Tibetan prisoners are monks) and
tortured. The Tibetan flag has been
banned, possession of a photograph
of the Dalai Lama lands you in prison
and celebrating his birthday on a
sacred mountain is not advised (as
demonstrated by 9th July 2013).
How has the rest of the world sat
back whilst the most peaceful nation
is slowly being eradicated? It has been
students who have pushed for Tibet’s
cause in the West, more so than
politicians who have turned a blind
eye to human rights violations. On
the 22nd October, at the quadrennial
UN Human right’s review in Geneva,
“Students for a Free Tibet” managed
to break through security and scaled
scaffolding at the UN headquarters in
Geneva with a banner saying: “China
fails human rights - UN stand up for
Tibet”. On Tuesday 5th November
student activists protested at the
Intercontinental Hotel in Westminster
against Intercontinental’s plans to
build a 5000 room hotel in Lhasa.
The plans indirectly give licence to
energy market, it detracts from the
integrity of science and health policy.
The UK could learn from this. The
composition of fracking fluids would
need to be disclosed, in line with
that of Government expenses and
the already established ethos of free
information.
Toconclude,sciencecommunication
may prove to be the crucial and
restorative link in the chain of the
future UK energy market. It can
serve to show that fracking, while
a chief focus, must be considered
within a cohesive approach to science,
economics and ethics. This may prove
to be easier said than done.
What does the Future Hold for Tibet?

Chinese plans of turning Tibet into
a commercialized concrete jungle.
Multiple NGOs, united action and
continuous protests land the Tibetan’s
cause in the headlines frequently.
While unforeseeable in the near
future, for Tibet to become truly
autonomous, let alone independent, it
does not seem a lost cause.
Once aware of Tibet’s situation,
I feel compelled to take action . If
you’re interested in supporting Tibet,
visit www.studentsforafreetibet.org
and like the Students for a free Tibet
Imperial College facebook page for
regular updates.
It is a nation
that, due to its
pacifist policies,
had no power
to withstand
occupation.
