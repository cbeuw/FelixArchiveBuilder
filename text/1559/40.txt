Man United v Arsenal
(Sunday 4:10pm, Sky Sports 1)
What contrasting starts to the sea-
son these two teams have had. The
signing of Mezut Ozil has brought
much-needed attacking nous to
Arsene Wenger’s outfit, whereas
Marouane Fellaini is fast becoming
a transfer flop. For Arsenal it is all
about maintaining their current form
– their run of matches between now
and Christmas is unenviable and they
mustn’t let their performances slip as
they have in recent years. Meanwhile,
United’s title challenge is only still
alive because Man City and Chelsea
have been so inconsistent. But be-
cause of that I think they will want
the win more and there were certainly
a lot of positives to take from their
strong show against Fulham.
Prediction: 2-1
Sunderland v Man City
(Sunday 2:05pm, Sky Sports 1)
There were precious few signs of
the bounce we were all expecting
from Sunderland at Hull last week
after their derby victory against New-
castle. By contrast, City claimed their
biggest ever Premier League win
against Norwich last week and for
them it is all about producing those
kinds of performances week in, week
out. The Black Cats may have a good
recent home record against Man City,
but having two of their starting 11 out
through suspension won’t help their
cause. All the signs point to a City win.
Prediction: 0-3
Tottenham v Newcastle
(Sunday 12pm, Sky Sports 1)
Newcastle did really well to beat
Chelsea last weekend, containing the
Blues for so long before hitting them
on the break. It seems as long as they
don’t concede early, their confidence
grows and they are capable of a result
against anybody. Spurs seem almost
to have too many superstars who each
expect the other to come up with the
goods. They just lack that cutting edge
despite their big-name summer sign-
ings. There could be boos ringing out
around White Hart Lane again this
Sunday.
Prediction: 1-1
Norwich v West Ham
(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Norwich suffered a battering at Man
City last week but yet again their per-
formance deserved better. They badly
need a win and they have an oppor-
tunity to get it here against the Ham-
mers, who still have no fit strikers.
Prediction: 1-0
Best of the rest
(Saturday 3pm unless stated)
Aston Villa v Cardiff
Aston Villa are simply not the same
side at home. Cardiff looked good
value for their win in the Welsh derby
last weekend and their defence will be
hard for Villa to break down. They cer-
tainly have the guile to claim all three
points.
Prediction: 0-1
Chelsea v West Brom
The Baggies continued their good
run against Palace last week but Chel-
sea will be reeling after their defeat at
Newcastle. Jose Mourinho has only
lost 3 of almost 200 home Premier
League games and shouldn’t have any
difficulties here.
Prediction: 3-1
Crystal Palace v Everton

Honous even
in Double
Header
Chris Carter gives his account.
The Imperial Falcons made a prom-
ising start to their season, splitting a
friendly double-header against UCL.
After a 7-2 loss in Game 1, Imperial
rallied to take Game 2 20-12, with an
impressive batting performance.
The first game started promisingly
for Imperial, as UCL failed to score
in their first inning, following some
accurate pitching by Zack Wang and
a spectacular leaping catch by rookie
right-fielder Stephane Mangeon. Af-
ter General Manager Matt Bidwell got
hit by the first pitch of the Imperial in-
nings, Zack hit a double to bring Matt
home, leaving Imperial 1-0 up after
the first innings. Despite Ashley Ng
hitting a double and Zack surviving a
pick-off attempt at third with a spec-
tacular dive, Imperial couldn’t add to
their tally.
After some sloppy fielding by Impe-
rial, however, UCL recovered to go 5-1
after their first three innings. Matt
Bidwell stepped up to the plate to lead
off the inning and blasted a monstrous
solo home run to centre field (al-
though the celebration left a lot to be
desired). The Falcons failed to capital-
ise, however, as Ashley and Zack were
left on base again after good hits.
Unfortunately, UCL added two more
runs in the fourth inning and, despite
a valiant effort by the lower order
(special mention to J.D. Smith’s fear-
some game face), Imperial couldn’t
come back, with UCL running out 7-2
winners.
The second game started well for
Imperial, as UCL’s new inexperienced
pitcher (it seemed the 50-Year-Old
Man from last year had retired) gave
up 9 runs in the top of the first, as al-
most the entire Falcons batting line-
up got on base. In the UCL inning,
Imperial brought on Vincent “Demon
Pitcher” Li, who reduced UCL to only
three runs. In the freezing cold and
driving rain, Imperial piled on the
pressure in the top of the second in-
nings, adding another 8 runs after a
number of walks and some good base
running.
The Falcons gave up runs in the bot-
tom of the second after a few wild
pitches and some slightly over-am-
bitious fielding (it turns out this isn’t
MLB and double plays are still a bit
beyond us), although by then it was
too late for UCL. Imperial added even
more runs in the top of the third (de-
spite a pitching change by UCL), after
hits by Zack Wang and Marcel “Asian
Kevin Youkilis” Ngan.
Imperial went into the final innings
13 runs ahead and looking certain of
victory. Some excellent catching by
Vincent kept the runs to a minimum,
and the first two batters were quickly
dispatched, leaving Imperial needing
only one out to win. After a couple of
wild pitches (and the threat of being
replaced by Marcel), Zack took con-
trol, and got the batter to ground-out
to finish the game, with Imperial run-
ning out 20-12 winners.
IC BASEBALL
It’s hard to see where Crystal Pal-
ace’s next point is going to come from,
let alone their next win. It should be
comfortable for the Toffees who are
quietly impressing this season.
Prediction: 0-2
Liverpool v Fulham
This is a home banker if there ever
was one. Liverpool have the best strike
partnership in the division, whereas
Fulham are consistently terrible away.
You just hope for Martin Jol’s sake this
doesn’t become a cricket score.
Prediction: 4-0
Southampton v Hull City
These sides are two of the best or-
ganised in the league. But the Tigers
are not as menacing away from the
KC Stadium and will struggle to break
down what is statistically one of the
best defences in Europe
Prediction: 1-0
Swansea v Stoke
Both of these sides will have started
the season with their sights set on the
top half but have flattered to deceive
thus far. Unfortunately for the neutral,
they struggle for goals so don’t expect
much entertainment.
Prediction: 1-0
