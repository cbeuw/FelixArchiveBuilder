Google Releases the Nexus 5

A
fter many weeks of
speculations, leaks,
and overwhelming
anticipation, Google
has finally taken the
wraps off their new flagship phone,
the Nexus 5.
The Nexus 5 is, like the Nexus 4,
manufactured by LG and modelled
after one of their flagship phones,
and comes in black and white.
The Nexus 5 is modelled after the
LG G2. Thankfully, the Nexus 5 has
ditched the rear buttons on the G2
(which LG touts as innovation), for
morepracticalbuttonplacements.The
phone comes with 2 GB of RAM, and
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 system-
on-chip (SoC), which is pretty much
the best SoC from Qualcomm you
can get on a smartphone at the time
of release. It boasts a 4.95-inch 1080p
screen with a staggering 444 pixels per
inch.Alloftheseareavailableforavery
affordable unlocked and contract-free
price of £299. The Nexus 5 has clearly
taken the best of the Nexus 4, and
corrected some of its glaring faults.
The Nexus 4 was a great device
one year ago for its price. As Felix
had wrote about it a year ago, the
Nexus 4 boasted some of the best
hardware you could get at that
time. However, it also fell short in
three areas, all of which Google has
addressed in the Nexus 5. Most (in)
famously, Google left out Long Term
Evolution (LTE), or 4G support in
the Nexus 4. This has been rectified
in the Nexus 5- it will allow you to
use it on any LTE network around
the world, save for North America.
The Nexus 4 also came with
limited storage options, namely only
8 GB and 16 GB. The Nexus 5 has
also rectified this by providing 16
and 32 GB options. Finally, while
the Nexus 4 suffered from horrible
availability issues, and the order
website promptly crashed under the
weight of its own popularity, the same
does not seem to be the case for the
Nexus 5. Initial orders made via the
Play Store have already been shipped,
and should arrive within the week.
Customers can also buy them from
retailers like Carphone Warehouse.
Alongside the debut of the Nexus 5
is a new Android version dubbed Kit
Kat. Kit Kat is another minor update
to the operating system (OS), with
some minor visual changes allowing
applications to turn the status bar
and the navigation bar transparent.
Kit Kat also continues the Google-
fying of the OS by turning some of the
core parts of the OS into Google apps
that can be updated via the Play Store,
as mentioned in a previous article
(How Google Updated Android
without Updating Android). The home
screen of Kit Kat is now essentially a
Google variant of the Facebook Home
concept, making Google Search
power many aspects of the interface.
The old Android texting app has also
been removed, in favour of integration
with Google Hangouts which now also
handles text. There are also various
under the hood changes to the OS that
are of more interest to developers,
such as the changing of the SELinux
mode from permissive to enforcing.
Google’s Nexus programme
began with the Nexus One as a
means of setting benchmarks for
other phone manufacturers to
work towards. Although the first
phone wasn’t exactly a commercial
success, subsequent releases have
garnered a dedicated fan-base.
This is quite evident when the US
Play Store started reporting multiple-
weeks of waiting for people who
want to order the phone late for all
the models. In the UK, at the time of
writing, the black coloured models
are all quoted as being shipped in
2-3 weeks time, while the white
coloured models are still available.
If you are looking for a new
smartphone, and are unwilling to be
tied down to a contract, the Nexus
5 is the phone for you. For the price,
you can get excellent hardware that no
other phone in the market can offer.
