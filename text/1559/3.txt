FRIDAY 08 NOV
On Wednesday November 6th, the
President of the Republic of Korea,
Park Geun-hye, paid a visit of Imperial
College, in order to make a speech
outlining her vision for scientific
partnership with “leading scientific
nations, such as the UK”.
She gave her speech at the UK-Korea
Creative Economy and Future Science
forum, hosted by the college. Provost
of Imperial College James Stirling said
that the college were “honoured that
President Park has chosen Imperial
for such a significant part of her State
Visit”. During her visit, President Park
was given demonstrations of various
pieces of ground breaking research,
including an “invisibility cloak” using
metamaterial technology. She also saw
projects such as the latest robotic body
sensing technology, plastic electronics
and quantum technologies. These are
fields where UK research is considered
to be world leading.
Science and Universities Minister
David Willetts MP, who accompanied
President Park on her visit to Imperial,
said, “International collaboration
across Higher Education is essential if
the UK is to remain ahead in the global
race for science and innovation.” He
also added “Imperial College London
is crucial to many of the eight great
technologies including big data,
robotics, space and synthetic biology.
Working alongside the Republic of
Korea will strengthen our relationship
and allow greater collaboration in
years to come.”
The visit itself began with speeches
from President Park, David Willetts
and Professor Stirling, following
which President Park was shown
the research being presented. In
addition to this, the event featured
workshops for academics, investors
and entrepreneurs from both nations
to explore additional UK-Korean
collaboration and development
in fields such as future innovative
technologies, digital cultural content,
and cooperation among small and
medium enterprises (including
additional support for startups).
In the lead up to the event, Imperial
signed an agreement to enhance UK-
Korean cooperation in developing
hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.
A Memorandum of Understanding
was signed by Professor Stirling and
Professor Taihyun Chang, Provost
of Pohang University of Science and
Technology (POSTECH) in Korea.
Imperial’s Energy Futures Lab is the
central hub for research into fuel cell
technologies in the United Kingdom.
Imperial is also due to sign a strategic
partnership agreement with the
Korean Institute of Science and
Technology (KAIST).
Imperial College already has a strong
connection with Korean universities,
having already attained extensive
links with KAIST, POSTECH and
Seoul National University. In addition
to this Imperial also has strong links
with Korean industry, having formed
partnerships with Samsung and LG.

T
he new-look postgraduate
bar is set to open this Friday,
with pictures released by
the Union and College
previewing what it will
look like and explaining the services
provided by the new space.
With its combination of wood tables
and green leather upholstery, the new
look bar was described by Kirsty Roy,
a PhD student from the department
of Materials as “Looking exactly like a
McDonalds”. Its previous incarnation,
the Holland Club which closed in
2012, had a ‘traditional British pub’
décor (i.e. ‘dark and dingy’) but it
was this atmosphere that many of its
regulars enjoyed.
The name, ħ,prompted half of the
people I interviewed to laugh and the
other half to face-palm.It was chosen
out of a shortlist of student and staff
submitted names, with the final choice
being made by a committee including
one of the Sabbatical Officers.
The most drastic change in operation
of the bar is the fact that during the
evening the space will be available
to all staff and students (including
undergraduates) for dinner. At this
time (between 5-7pm), the evening
dinner service currently provided
by the Queen’s Tower Rooms will
be served in canteen area of ħ, and
the postgrad and staff pub area at
the back will be closed off behind a
movable soundproof partition. Whilst
allowing the staff and postgraduates
some privacy, they will still have
to potentially walk through a busy
canteen full of undergraduates to
get to the bar, a fact that several staff
and PhDs we spoke to were unhappy
about. Fortunately for postgrads and
staff a-like, this arrangement will
not be the case on Friday evenings.
As anyone who used to use the old
Holland Club knows, Friday nights
were by far the busiest evenings,
frequently reaching full capacity by
6pm. Instead on Fridays the ħ will be
serving [alcohol] from 4pm and the
whole space, canteen and bar, with a
combined capacity for 250 people, will
be serving staff and postgrads only.
The previous entrance to the old
Holland Club is now closed off and
serves as a fire escape, while the new
entrance is only accessible via the
Sherfield building. Several staff we
spoke to predicted calls for this to be
re-opened so that access would be
available for staff to go enjoy a pint
without having to come face to face
with their tutees eating. However,
according to Union sources the door
cannot be used as an entrance due
to the conditions of their license.
They also mentioned that the new
entrance provides wheelchair access
(via the new lift) and the bar is also at
a wheelchair-friendly height.
Despite complaints about the
appearance of the bar, and the
general bemusement at how the one-
space, two-uses policy will actually
work when the whole thing opens
next week; most people we spoke
to seemed resigned that they would
probably get used to the new look,
with one PhD student summarising it
as “sort of like when Facebook updates
and I hate it for a bit,” whilst agreeing
“that it makes sense that they need the
space, but it sucks because I loved the
old place.”
