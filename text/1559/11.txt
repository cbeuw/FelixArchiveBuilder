FRIDAY 08 NOV
COMMENT
“
”
I
was born in Kenya. I lived there
until I was 10 years old. I learned
to swear at someone in Kiswahili
and Kikuyu. One of my fondest
Kenyan memories is my first ever
live cricket match at the Gymkhana
Stadium in Nairobi. It was the 2003
World Cup and Sri Lanka were in
town. The gulf in class was enormous
and yet we trounced them by 53 runs.
It really doesn’t get better than that.
Sadly enough the fortunes of Kenya
Cricket (and I guess the entire country
in 2007) have plummeted to some
painful lows, mainly due to financial
and personnel mismanagement.
My elder brother decided he wanted
to study medicine. Since there was no
way we could afford international fees
my mum, brother and I moved to the
UK to try and get home-fees status.
My brother graduated as a doctor
in 2009 and is now well on his way
to becoming an anaesthetist. More
importantly he is now a father. It
would appear that the move has been
a good decision.
Having completed secondary
education here my interest in Kenya
became passive. People in the UK
would say “You’re not black!” or, “Is
that the capital city of Africa?” when
I told them I was from Kenya. Until
this summer I hadn’t been back since
December 2008. After all, why would
I want to go back to a place where
electricity ran three days a week and
where hot water was a luxury? Life was
a lot more challenging than it should
have been. Yet ‘home’ is and always
will be Kenya. I think most Kenyans
would agree that we are happy to
slate Kenya as much as possible but
we have very, very little tolerance for
foreigners doing it. This is borne out
of a sense of pride. The jubilation at
Barack Obama becoming president
of the USA was huge in Kenya. It
prompted my dad to send me a text
saying, “Wananchi na kuja!” meaning,
“The local citizen has come.”
I followed the recent March
elections as much as possible. Many
media and news agencies claimed
they were the most important
election in Kenyan history. This
cannot be stressed enough. Yet no one
cites Kenyan history to support this,
save the bloodshed five years ago. It
was incredible to see large queues at
the voting stations. “We have been
waiting for this for the past five years.”
Were the comments of a Mr. Anthony
Wachira to the BBC.
The great thing about primary
school in Kenya is the two main
aspects of our history classes: The
Roman Empire and Kenyan history.
Our teacher was a very passionate
Irishman.
Kenya was a British colony since
the end of the 19th century as part
of the East Africa Protectorate.
It served as a British base during
World War 1. Following this, political
activity in Kenya started to grow as
the local people bore the brunt of
the increased taxes and lower wages.
Kenya was an important British base
in World War 2, stimulating African
nationalism. Meanwhile tensions
were rising between the British (who
wanted to impose their agricultural
methods) and the Kikuyu tribe (who
refused). As a reaction to exclusion
from political representation the
Kikuyu people founded Kenya’s first
African political protest movement
in 1921. It was the Young Kikuyu
Association led by Harry Thuku.
The most famous events occurred
between 1952 to 1956, known as the
Mau Mau Uprising, an armed local
Kikuyu movement directed against
the colonial government and the
European settlers. It was the largest
(and most ferocious) movement in
British Africa. The Mau Mau fighters
are declared as freedom heroes
but the Mau Mau movement was
described as, “a disease which had
been eradicated and must never be
remembered again,” by soon-to-be
first Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta.
In June British Foreign Secretary
William Hague announced that
Kenyans tortured by British colonial
forces during the Mau Mau uprising
will receive payouts totalling £20m.
In 1962 a coalition government
formed and a constitution was
established. Kenya achieved self-
Government with Jomo Kenyatta as its
first Prime Minister. He is renowned
as founding father of Kenya. Ethnic
tensions remained as Kenyatta of
the Kikuyu tribe reallocated “re-
possessed land” from European
farmers to his fellow Kikuyus. This
created tensions with the other tribes.
Likewise President Moi redistributed
wealth to his Kalenjin tribe while
marginalising (and even attacking) the
other Kikuyu and Luo tribes. Having
governed with a corrupted iron fist
from 1978-2002 fresh elections took
place, leading to Mwai Kibaki being
named president. There was much
hope in Kenya and the economy grew
rapidly, until Kibaki was ensnared
in Moi’s leftovers. Kibaki’s regime
quickly fell apart and Raila Odinga
(supported Kibaki in 2002) attacked
Kibaki’s government in the lead up to
the 2007 elections. Kibaki and Odinga
were the main contestants in the 2007
election which appeared to have been
won by Odinga, until accusations of
vote-rigging filtered in. Kibaki swore
himself in as President.
Months of ethnic violence followed
between the Kikuyus, Luos and
Kalenjins.
Enough has been written about the
atrocities. One of my idols, Wangari
Maathai (first woman to win the
Nobel Peace Prize), said, “If they had
resources and better leadership they
would not be killing each other over
grazing ground and water.”
A new constitution was set out by
the government in 2010. It is the first
(desperately needed) redaction since
the 1969 constitution It has been met
by widespread international acclaim
in its efforts to tackle corruption and
strengthen civil society. The recent
election was pitted as a two-horse
race between Raila Odinga and Uhuru
Kenyatta (son of Jomo, the first Prime
Minister). The latter (who won) stands
accused by the International Criminal
Court along with his Deputy President
William Ruto for being involved in
organising the 2007 attacks.
I returned to Kenya this summer
and was astounded. There are new
high-rise buildings and apartments
everywhere in Nairobi. The Chinese
have built some new flyovers and
repaired some main roads. Roads
leading out to other major cities have
also been built. Whatever you can get
here, you can now get over there .
I was in Nairobi at the time of
the Westgate terrorist attack. I live
quite close by. Investigations are
onging and new CCTV footage is
still being released: It further lets the
Government down. Police and Army
werefound to have looted the banks
and jewellery shops in the building.
This is a strange situation for me.
Kenya is an outrageously bountiful
country of wildlife, scenery and
culture. Kenya’s economy is on the
verge of massive growth and yet things
social security is still terrible. Traffic
is horrendous and the inner city roads
are still gravel.
Eye-watering sums of money are
being invested into projects like
Konza City which aims to be the
‘silicon savannah’. It will cost around
US$14.5billion. There have also been
oil discoveries in Lake Turkana,. This
should be good news. I consider myself
an African and therefore optimism is
not a choice; it is a necessity. I have
faith in Uhuru Kenyatta to leave a
meaningful legacy. If he doesn’t, I
hope that the next president will.
Hope springs eternal. Harambee!
