H
ere at Imperial College
Netball HQ we had
high hopes for our first
ever freshers’ tour. With
Nancy Edge as the club’s
Tour Secretary, and a trip to Brighton
in the midst, it was bound to be a great
weekend for all! However, no freshers
signed up so it was going to be a
committee bonding session if nothing
else!
After bad news about Club Captain
Toni Semmence’s ankle the same
week, treasurer Harriet Rumgay was
all too ready to cancel the trip as on
tour-eve it was looking like we would
only have 6 players to take to Sussex
Uni. After much peer pressure by club
member Emily Rolfe, our treasurer
was persuaded to go ahead with the
trip, especially after having called up
the hostel in Brighton to see about
getting a refund on the rooms and
being told “no refunds… but you
can still cancel if you want?” swiftly
replying with “we’ll keep all the rooms
then!”
On the morning of the tour our
treasurer had calmed down enough to
take the driver’s seat, only to find the
engine warning light staring straight
at her. Throwing caution to the wind
we climbed aboard and set off for
Brighton in style, all thanks to Surf
Soc who left their Cornwall sing-a-
long CDs in the glove compartment
with a few pre-tour mix-tapes. Thanks
guys!
The traffic was horrendous. So
were the drivers. With many cut-ins
and close encounters, we took to the
bus lane a lot more than we would
have liked. With “GET OUT OF MY
BUS LANE” a common scream from
the driver’s seat, it was not looking
good for our match in 2 hours’ time.
We finally hit the motorway where,
sadly, someone had hit something
else causing huge delays coming into
Brighton. After a wrong-turn or 2 we
arrived an hour late for our matches,
however the Sussex Uni girls were
more than happy to see us and we got
straight into game-play.
Somehow the Club Captain’s ankle
had miraculously recovered as she
took to playing C like a duck to water.
With the tour secretary choosing
the team’s positions, and everyone
switching anyway, we found out a
couple of our keepers were actually
pretty good shooters, a couple of our
shooters were pretty good defenders,
and that Emily Rolfe was just good at
everything!
After our matches we set off to the
beach. On the way social secretary
Georgie Weston showed her social
skills in getting us a shout out on
Radio 1, though we didn’t really know
what it said as we all screamed when
we heard “Imperial Netball…” Oops!
Anyway, this set our spirits high for
the night ahead and we made our way
over to the seafront to grab some fish
& chips and hit the pier! Whoever
thought the waltzes and dodgems
were a good idea after a full meal must
have been mad; however the girls kept
it all down and decided to go for a
paddle in the sea…
So most of the girls just went to dip
their toes in the water… not our social
Secretaries! Georgie and Zoe Hudson
leapt straight in, after confirming
that Georgie is actually a qualified
life guard, and cooled off in the huge
waves. Then it was time to find the
hostel and get ready for our night on
the town!
After finding out a little bit more
about each other we set off to meet
the girls from Sussex Uni for a bit of
a hoe down with some bunnies. Soon
enough, someone at the Halloween
party downstairs threw a stink bomb
so we took it as our cue to leave. “We
didn’t want to stay at your Yates’s
anyway!”
We moved on to Funfair where
Georgie was mistaken for a model
and had her picture taken with some
randoms, and soon enough we were
all knackered. Our Club Captain got
told to put her shoes back on or leave
(classy lady). Treasurer was being a
responsible driver so we decided it
was time to go. About 20 minutes later
the Sussex Uni girls finally finished
their goodbyes and we braced the
gale force winds and rain for the short
sprint back to the hostel.
With the clocks having gone back
an hour it was way too early to call it
a night so we popped to the nearest
kebab shop for some grub. Sponsor
secretary Ella Mårtenson used
her persuasive skills in securing a
pretty big deal with her garlic mayo;
meanwhile our fixtures secretary
Laura Kor absolutely demolished her
burger, whereas Georgie smeared hers
all over her face, hands and the table…
It was definitely time for bed.
After a few hours’ shutweye we were
up early to pick at the “continental”
breakfast and get back in the minibus.
We made it to London in good time
after some excellent eco-driving from
the Treasurer- always thinking of
the club’s money, obviously- and just
before the storm hit!
All in all we had a great time in
Brighton and would like to thank the
Sussex Uni girls for their hospitality,
and everyone who came on tour for
making it a success!
We have also gained a new
committee member as what would
be honorary secretary, but we already
have one of those, so she can be our
legendary secretary- Emily Rolfe!
Immortals
slay the
Dragons
26-0
A
fter a preseason win
against Sussex Saxons,
the Immortals were ready
to take on Westminster Dragons
at Harlington in their first regular
season game.
The first half opened with
big drives up the field from the
Immortals, and the Dragons
being reduced to punting away
possession. The scoring was
opened by Emanuel Olagbaju who
broke several tackles to rush in
from 25-yards.
Hutchinson continued to stop
the Dragons’ pass game whilst
Guillaume Fontan stopped the
run. The rookie quarterback, Toby
Sinclair, then snuck into the end
zone from 1-yard, and with the
2-point conversion completed by
Duncan MacKinnon the lead was
14-0 going into half time.
The strong opening continued
into the second half. The Dragons
tried to catch out the Immortals
with an onside kick, but luckily
Charlie Edwardson was in position
to recover the ball. Sinclair rushed
in for another score, which was
followed by a goal line stop by the
Immortal’s defense.
The win was sealed when veteran
Tino Millar caught a 30-yard pass
from Joe. The Immortals’ defence
made another stop and the hard-
fought game was over. Next week
the Immortals travel to Greenwich
Mariners for what promises to be
another exciting game.
