Hangman Editor In Employment Scandal
H
angman has come under
fire for exclusively using
fictional reporters,
prompting a review of
Hangman employment
policy. A series of damning
complaints arose from real reporters
who were refused work. These
cited numerous reporters who were
refused interview on the grounds
that Hangman only hires fictionally.
The civil rights group Real
Pride condemned the hiring policy,
“We strongly object to the hiring poli-
cy at Hangman. Many reporters we’ve
spoken to have been very well quali-
You probably can’t translate this can
you?
If you can should
should probably come
right for us! We need
people liek you, smart,
self-confident, calm,
collected, crass and
bloody amazing.
Well, let;s be honest,
maybe only one of those is
true, but hey, desperate
times. Consider this my
pity plea, come to me and
give me things.
Did you know I once ate
a tree? Yeah, those were
my CivEng days, well, it
seems like a very long
time now. Anyhow, now I’m
a recovering engineer,
instead I’m spending my
time walking around
forever alone in parks
and photobombing pictures
for the lols. No, really,
I’ve just got far to much
time, which is why this
article is so weird. You
tend to get a bit funny
in the head after a while
when you spend to long is
the basement. Did you
want ice cream, father?
But the dogs say that the
milk is curdling in the
winter sun. Oh, and the
other voices are telling
me to bring beer to the
Felix office, lots of
beer.
fied, but ignored simply because they
existed.”
The Fictional Writers Union
(FWU) claims that the reason that
so many fictional people are hired is
due to a lack of regulation of fictional
rights and that fictional reporters are
on 0-hour contracts. Timothy Mc-
Sweeney, the FWU rep for Hangman,
said:
“Of course we want equal
pay and benefits. What this all boils
down to is respect. Hopefully this
highlights the struggle of the fiction-
al. Naturally, we don’t face the same
problems as reallie, but we have fic-
tional issues, like lluminati putting
ricin in our water”.
“We are not going to take
this lying down. We will be protest-

P
arliament, 1605 -
Following a heinous
attempt on this regal
editor’s life on Tuesday,
this Royal Highness insists
we should be burning more Catholics.
How can I, the King of England and
Scotland, ignore such a mean-spirited
attempt on my life by those two Pope-
loving, incense-sniffing Catho’s -
Catesby and Fawkes?
In fact, it would be highly un-royal
of me not to burn as many bloody
Catholics as I can get my hands on.
I’d even burn my own mother, Mary
‘Queen’ of ‘Scots’, at this point.
However, simply burning effigies
on this so-called Bonfire Night is not
enough. From now on, every year,
I, your Sire, insist that you burn real
Catholics every November 5th from
now on.
And if we run out, go to Spain. There
are fuck-loads there.
Let us not let these idolatry,
indulgence-purchasing, guilt-ridden
bastards have their sordid way with
our parliaments.
So here is my advice to you, my
subjects, crack out the dry wood; get
your hands on a tinder-box; storm the
nearest Catholic’s house and tie the
treasonous fuckers to the pyre.
Not so cocky now, Mr Pope. All glory
to Martin Luther and the Protestants.
Felix in the past.

heard the voices of 2000 fictional peo-
ple? It’s deafening, let me assure you.”
When questioned, Hang-
man replied, “McSweeney, he takes
a pen and paper and he gets it done.
Unlike these real reporters, fictionals
don’t spend all day worrying about
their social media presence, whatever
that is”.
“They actually research sto-
ries properly. They don’t just copy
from a press release handed to them
by ICU, for example. Why, just the
other night, Tim stayed in the Felix of-
fice until 11pm to finish a story.”
“And when he was done, I locked
him in the back room. You can’t trust
these fictional types, they’ll steal any-
thing that’s not nailed down.”
Mystery
I mean look at Pope Frnacis. Sure, he acts all liberal now,
but as soon as you’ve relaxed your guard, that’s when he’ll
set alight to the gunpowder under your parliament.
