This week, tired of the halloween
candy you have been eating for a
week, you decide to have one fi-
nal mega meal. You pour a whole
bucket of sweets (including wrap-
pers) into a cauldron and start stir-
ring away. What you didn’t know
was that this sugary combination
gives birth to a hideous demon
from the netherworld, who once
he hardens sufficiently, jumps out
and eats you. Oh, the irony.
This week, quite amused by
the hamster horoscopes of
last week, you decide to buy
yourself a furry companion.
However it turns out this little
buddy, off the back of hal-
loween, is actually channel-
ing the soul of jack the ripper,
and goes on a vicious killing
spree ending up with your
lecturer. Well at least no more
coursework, right?
This week, you are am-
bushed by the bedraggled
Felix editor in the JCR. Fed
up of thinking up stupid horo-
scopes himself, he ties you
up and forces you to write
Hangman horoscopes under
threat of torture. After you try
to think of something funny,
you...QUICK HE’S OUT EAT-
ING!! IN THE BACK OF THE
FELIX OFFICE! SAVE ME!
This week, on a pleasant stroll
through Exhibition road, you
see a hideous chocolatey be-
ing from hell munching on
tourists. As a chemistry stu-
dent you are unfazed (you see
demonic carbon chains all the
time), and as you walk buy take
a lick of the being’s coarse sug-
ary hide. Hmmmm, burnt skin
and caramel, your favourite!
Today a fresher will come up to
you asking for directions. You
will give the poor kid wrong di-
rections because you think its
funny. This evil deed of yours
will haunt you for life.
Today you will read the politics
section of Felix. Amazed by
the quality of the articles, you
will decide to write for them
too. This will subsequently re-
sult in good health and fortune
in the future.
You pick up a hamster and
walk towards the wall. Oh,
wait, the hamster thing was last
week. Late again. You look up
and your lecturer is staring you
right in the face. Whoops!
You enter the Felix office
dressed as the grim reaper. You
leave with a thing, a kinky police
officer and a twenty-something
year old man. Funnily enough
that’s enough to tip you over the
edge. You start reaping the souls
of the young, you don’t live for
long. YDLFL
The misalignment of planets
will result in bad fortune for
you. A young man will come
up to you offering you a ticket
for the next Ministry of Sound
event and you will accept it.
You look up from your desk to
look at the class you’re sup-
posed to be teaching. You
see a student reading Felix in
the class instead of doing the
problem sheet. Oh, well, you’ll
get them back in the exams,
their handwriting is fairly distin-
citve.
You decide to start playing
pokémon. After spending
£200 quid on a 3DS and the
game you then complete the
game in a week. You would
have had better value for
money if you’d literally set
fire to it in the street. At least
watching the arts grads
scrabble for £5 notes would
provide some amusement.
The machines in Sainsbury’s
piss you off to no end.
At least you didn’t have to use
your AK, today must have been
a good day.

Nation Confused Over
Immigrants
F
ollowing the news this week
that there was a global wine
shortage last year, middle
class-types up and down
the country were sent into a
wild, wine-buying frenzy.
The middle class everywhere plead-
ed with winemakers and vines across
the world to increase their produc-
tion.
“Please don’t make us drink wine
produced in this country”
“There’s no sun here, it’’ll be gastly”
In a desperate attempt to get the
wine flowing again, some middle class
members flew to france and proceed-
ed to shout at vines up and down the
country.
“Please,if you have any mercy, find
it within yourselves to grow those ex-
tra grapes” “Otherwise, what will the
Johnson’s next door say?”
“Is There Nothing Left To Unconditionally Hate?”
T
he Nation was reportedly
confused this week
after a study by UCL t
highlighted that immigrants
from the European
Economic Area (EEA) make a net
contribution to the British economy.
“Who are we supposed to hate now?”
said numerous UK citizens following
the revelations of the report.
“Are you seriously telling us that
some of these people contribute
meaningfully?”
“Great. Now we have to be more
measured when we see a non-Brit
working” The majority of the populace
added.
The news that those from the EEA
were contributing 34% more in taxes
than they were claiming in benefits was
met with low groans from across the
country.
“For fuck’s sake, can’t we just fucking
hate these fuckers already?”
“I mean they’re foreign, surely
they must be inferior, underhand or
downright lazy?” said a vast number of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.
The news has come as a particular
nuisance to home students at Imperial
College London, who, for some time
have been secretly hoping that they’re
hate of the foreign students at the
university was justified by some kind of
statistical evidence.
“Oh great, you’re telling me that all
those French people in South Ken are
actually helping our country.? Fan-
fucking-tastic” said one student.
“Bloody UCL always looking for any
opportunity to fuck us over”
