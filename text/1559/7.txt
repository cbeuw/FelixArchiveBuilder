SCIENCE
Traditional ecological knowledge: the old versus the new
Nika Levikov on just how old customs can bring us up to speed for the future
T
raditional ecological
knowledge (TEK) is not
a new concept, especially
for indigenous peoples
themselves or those who
practice old customs. However, we
still find ourselves merely engaging
in dialogue about how TEK should be
appliedtopolicy-makingandresearch.
The world of conservation is only now
recognising that incorporating other
disciplines is necessary if any changes
we try to make as scientists are going
to stick.
I first learned about TEK when
I attended an annual meeting held
by the Society for Conservation
Biology in 2010. The topic was how
to build a bridge of communication
between indigenous peoples and
scientists. I was surprised to see the
anger and bitterness from indigenous
communities, that such a dialogue was
only being put to the table at that time.
Why hadn’t it happened sooner?
“There is something Western
scientists don’t understand,” they said,
“a spiritual connection that makes
our relationship to the land unique”.
I would argue that there are plenty
of scientists with a spiritual side, but
were these communities right? Do
they know the land in an intimate way
that scientists can never accomplish?
I’m convinced that the indigenous
peoples living in reservations in
Arizona aren’t the only ones who feel
this way. Modern day society finds
countless ways to further fragment
itself.
We are faced with a history that
is dark, one that many people are
unwilling to forget and perhaps not
evenforgive.Itisclearthatwhilstwesit
in our self-righteous chairs exclaiming
that barriers must come down, they
haven’t completely. Targeting climate
change mitigation could be a way of
building a bridge.
Many solutions that have been
posed in the recent past involve
alternative energy sources and
being ‘green’, but the people most
affected by climate change tend to
be indigenous communities in poor
developing countries. Adaptation by
some scientists is being presented as
a solution, given that extreme weather
conditions such as droughts and
floods have already made an impact.
Indigenous people have applied
TEK successfully in this regard.
In the African Sahel, for instance,
farmers use a zero-tilling method that
allows their crops to prosper under
harsh climate. The Inuit hunters
in Alaska have been able to keep
hunting bowhead whales despite their
changing migrations. It took years for
scientists to realize that their estimate
of the bowhead whale population was
wrong and that the Inuit had a much
more accurate number. The Inuit also
brought up the importance of wind
strength and direction as a factor in
analysing migration patterns.
Another success story is with The
Hotspots Fire Project in Australia,
which is getting communities together
to talk about fire and how to manage
it because of increasing risk of fire
outbreaks due to climate change.
Along with landowners and scientists,
the Aboriginal community is taking
part, spreading their knowledge on
fire management.
The extent to which their knowledge
is being applied is unclear, but
recognising that these people have
adaptation methods that have worked
for many years is a move in the right
direction.
Climate change is a global problem,
but there is no global solution. As with
other aspects of conservation, the
possible solutions need to be applied
on a local level. Using TEK helps
localise the problems and mitigation
efforts.
There is a risk that TEK might be
‘wrong’ and evidence behind certain
strategies are usually anecdotal and/
or biased, but the rate at which the
climate is changing means we don’t
have the luxury of time. TEK could
speed up the scientific process by
providing scientists with information
that gets them to ask the appropriate
questions and gather data more
quickly.
So let’s cut the dialogue about what
we should be doing as scientists
and conservationists. A systemic
strategy should be put in place to
go beyond initial communication
between indigenous communities and
everyone else.
TEK isn’t science, but without it, we
risk greater biodiversity loss, cultural
loss, and a slowed implementation of
climate change solutions. Using TEK
should be the norm.
After all, with climate change
already negatively impacting people
across the world, what more do we
have to lose?
Science image of the week: a digital hologram of malaria
T
his rather unassuming
collection of blobs is
actually a male Plasmodium
sp. parasite (on the left, with
the ‘tail’ known as a flagella)
swimming among red blood cells,
looking to penetrate into them to
replicate within their fragile structure.
This parasite causes malaria, and is
spread via the mosquito Anopheles
gambiae when they take up blood
during feeding, unknowingly
spreading the parasite from person to
person.
Upon the parasite replicating to
breaking point, the cells will burst
open to relinquish a whole new
population of the parasite that will
then go on to continue the lifecycle
of this potent protozoan, or simply
invade more red blood cells.
It is not what this image is capturing
however, but in what way this image
has been produced that is notable.
Scientists have developed a 3D
filming technique that creates digital
holograms of the sperm-like cells,
known as microgametes, to show
just how they infect the cells in the
bloodstream. Understanding how
these microgametes then mate
together in their sexual lifecycle could
leadtoimprovingpreventivemethods
of the disease from spreading.
The researchers saw that the
microgametes move in an irregular,
lopsided corkscrew motion, allowing
them to move in a multitude of
directions to find female mates whilst
swimming among blood cells.
This was developed by the
University of Edinburgh and the
Rowland Institute at Harvard
University.
Dr Sarah Reece, Royal Society
Fellow at the University of Edinburgh
and one of the authors of the study,
said: “Findings gained using our
unique system provide us with a
better understanding of how malaria
parasites mate and spread this
deadly disease, and have revealed
that malaria sperm, and similar
organisms, have greater freedom
of movement than was previously
thought.”
Local knowledge of those that live in close confines with nature could help solve issues facing ecology today
