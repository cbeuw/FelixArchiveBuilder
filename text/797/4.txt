Heroic Mark saves lives in Wales
Several members of Canoe Club
would have nearly drowned off the
Gower Peninsula last weekend, had
it not been for the quick thinking of
Mark Jones, one of the more
experienced members of the Club.
The Club were on a canoe-surfing
trip to Rhosilli in Wales for the
weekend. On Sunday the tide was
going out when the club wanted to
surf. There was an onshore breeze,
but the waves were fairly small,
suggesting safe conditions. President
Nigel Eatough, who was supervising
safety, left the beach but did not
designate someone else to take on his
responsibility. When one of the
members, Martin Love, capsized, he
was unable to hang on to his canoe
due to the water conditions. When Mr
Jones saw what had happened he
managed to reach him and pull him
back to shore. Near the beach Canoe
Club Secretary Jenny Ramsey, who
had walked into the sea to help
Martin, got into difficulties herself
when pushed into deeper water by
waves. A group of canoeists
decided to carry on surfing, again
with no-one in charge. At one point
all three of the canoeists on the sea
(Kevin Powell in a single, Andrew
Haslem and Chris Home in a double)
capsized and rapidly drifted out of
reach of their craft. Fortunately Mark
Jones was also in a canoe and was
able to help them as well.
At first sight it appeared to the two
in the double that Kevin Powell was
trapped under his canoe. However, it
soon became clear that the canoe was
empty, as it was rolling unweighted.
Mark Jones first went to rescue the
pair, pulling one of them back onto
the double with difficulty due to the
wind and unusual currents. Whilst
pulling in the empty canoe Mark
himself capsized but managed to roll
back over. However, had he been in
difficulty, there would not have been
anyone to rescue him.
After the ordeal, everyone had put
on dry clothes and sweet, milky tea
was distributed to calm nerves. At
least two people were suffering from
mild shock.
Eventually Nigel appeared and was
told of the events. Mark Jones
commented later: "Nigel implied it
was the groups' fault". This was
despite the fact that the President had
had difficulties himself in righting his
canoe after capsizing.

Mark Jones
who capsized said that it was "a
group of strong canoeists caught out
by unexpectedly strong currents" and
that in future even more care would
be taken to ensure canoeing only took
place in safe conditions. He described
Nigel Eatough as "a well-meaning
guy who just hadn't had experience
of these conditions".
Club Secretary Jenny Ramsey told
FELIX yesterday: 'We don't want it
to put people off the Club.'
C&G fiasco
The City & Guilds Union Executive
elections have had to be postponed
until the last week of this term
because both presidential candidates
have pulled out. Both Chris Stapleton
(Aero) and Neil Smith (Mech Eng)
withdrew after the electoral papers
had gone down. Due to the Guilds
system of electing their President,
Vice-President (VP) and Honorary
Secretary, the three elections have had
to be re-run in order that losers of the
Presidential election may step down
to the VP or Hon Sec elections.
At the Hustings Union General
Meeting (part one) yesterday, David
Osborne was ratified as Honorary
Junior Treasurer. The unopposed
candidate for Academic Affairs
Officer did not turn up to the meeting
and therefore could not be ratified.
