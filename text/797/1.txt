All the President's men
Nigel Baker will be next year's President of Imperial College
Union. The results of the 1988 sabbatical elections were released
last night two and a half hours after the polls closed in all
departments. Mr Baker will be joined in the Union Office by
Chas Brereton who was returned as Deputy President and Ian
Morris as Honorary Secretary (Events). Bill Goodwin was
elected as FELIX Editor. All winners passed quota on the first
count.
Nigel Baker was unavailable for
comment.
Next year's FELIX Editor, Bill
Goodwin, seemed staggered by his
large majority. When asked to
comment he replied: 'Let me have
a drink first!'
Chris Martin admitted to being
'relieved' when he was told of the
result. He said: 'The best way to get
from A to B is not necessarily a
straight line.' This has been quoted
completely out of context.
Martyn Peck, the other
unsuccessful candidate for Editor,
exclaimed: 'I've been robbed, guv!'
The results will be taken to
tomorrow's Results Union General
Meeting for ratification.
The number of people voting in the
election was slightly higher than last
year with 1157 people voting in the
Presidential election. Students in all
departments and from Silwood took
part in the ballot, although no ballot
box was sent to St. Mary's.
Chas Brereton, next year's
Deputy President, expressed his
relief that the election was finally
over, in view of the fact that he had
missed 'so many lectures' and had
a large amount of work to catch up
on.
Ian Morris, who was the first
successful candidate to be informed,
said that he was pleased that the
contest for Honorary Secretary
(Events) had been so amicable. 'It
could have been nasty', he said.
