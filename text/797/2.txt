FELIX
So Nigel Baker is next year's
President. As he was the only
serious candidate to stand, this is
not at all surprising. I think Nigel
will be a good President if he learns
to listen to himself and not others.
He is keen, well-organised and
keeps a cool head in difficult
situations.
Chas Brereton just beat Steve
Mercer for the post of Deputy
President. This was the most
interesting election of them all. For
a nearly unknown candidate to
come so close to the union officer,
most known for his verbose reports
to Council, must surely say
something.
Ian Morris won Honorary
Secretary (Events) comfortably.
Rodger had some good ideas but Ian
had the experience and the trendy
haircut. I think Ian has the potential
to do this job really well and, as a
simple student of Physics next year,
I am looking forward to all the new
events that are going to come out
of the creation of the new job.
Congratulations to all those who
won and sobs to all those who
didn't.
St Mary's?
Why were there no ballot boxes at
St Mary's? Don't they have a right
to vote too? Does anybody care?
FELIX
This has been one of the saddest
days of my term as FELIX Editor.
One of the reasons I stood for the
post was to continue the FELIX
'spirit', not to further any
journalistic career. It's very hard
for me to describe this 'spirit' to any
person who hasn't been a staff
member. It is the 'getting-FELIX-
out-on-a-Friday-whatever-happens'
spirit. It's all about caring for the
Paper and its future. It's when you
may have more interesting things to
do, like drink in the bar with your
mates, but the Paper needs folding
and collating, so you stay and help.
It's about defending editorial
freedom. Next year this spirit will
be gone.
FELIX is dead. Long live Felix.
Shan's election fiasco
Paul Shanley, FELIX tipster and man-of-the-moment, ran a book on
this year's sabbatical elections. Due to election rules we were unable
to print the odds until after the voting! So here is the way the odds
went and how wrong our man-of-the-moment was...
The book opened Wednesday
lunchtime. Opening show of betting

After some varied betting, the book
closed on Monday at 9.30pm at:

arrested for importuning 10-1.
Others unchanged.
Mr Shanley went into hiding last
night. Several people are known to be
looking for him and the money he
owes them.
P.S. FELIX Editor Judith Hackney
placed a bet on a horse for the second
time in her entire life yesterday.
Despite the advice of her tipster, she
placed a squid on Pearl Run in the
4.30pm at Warwick. The horse won.
Miss Hackney is the proud owner of
£2.75.
