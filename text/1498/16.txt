Founder Stories: Storify and MinuteBox
Last Friday, as part of the Impe-
rial Entrepreneurs speaker series
programme, the founders of Storify
(storify.com), Xavier Damman, and
MinuteBox (minutebox.com), Josh
Liu, came to the Imperial Business
School.
The evening kicked off with a pre-
sentation from Imperial Entrepre-
neurs about what they do and the set
of events planned out for the year.
Both speakers had fascinating stories
of entrepreneurship and how they
grew their businesses from scratch in
uncertain times.
Xavier, who has a background in
Computer Science, joined the City
for one year before swiftly moving
on to starting his own business. His
first concept was to develop a product
to help people publish stories around
social media, in particular Twitter. He
was bold, and moved from Brussels
to Silicon Valley with his girlfriend
without knowing what to expect and
with only a few contacts. After six
months of hard work and networking,
his business, Storify, got $2 million
funding from Khosla Ventures and
also managed to sucure a co-founder
in the media industry. Xavier was
juggling his time between meetings
with venture capitalists and coding
the product by himself.
His start-up, Storify, allows peo-
ple and companies to create stories
around posts on social media sites in-
cluding Twitter, Facebook, and You-
tube. He is passionate about the con-
cept of sharing and how his product
allows people to capture individual
posts, photos and links that would
otherwise have been lost in the web,
and create stories around them. Ac-
cording to Xavier “Everybody is a re-
porter, but thanks to journalists, those
voices can impact wide audiences, be
remembered, change the world”. His
aim is to reinvent storytelling with
social media; to make everyone a
‘journalist’.
One tip he gives to aspiring entre-
preneurs: “Don’t ask for permission;
ask for forgiveness.” It is, after all,
in the words of Steve Jobs, those of
us who “think different ... have no
respect for the status quo”, that will
make a noticeable difference in this
world.
The second visiting entrepreneur
was Josh Liu from Minutebox. Josh
is an alumni of Imperial College, and
his product focuses on getting people
forming contacts between specialists
in certain areas of expertise. Though
the first iteration of his product got
some negative publicity on Tech-
Crunch (a leading technology/start-
up blog), Minutebox went on to be-
come a succesful startup, enabling
individuals to take part in live chats
with professionals in various fields
through looking at their LinkedIn
profiles. Josh came from a working
class family and fought hard to break
out of it and build his own business.
His biggest piece of advice from the
evening was to make sure you have
a great team when starting out, as
these are the people who you will
be spending most of your time with.
Even though Josh was not a technical
cofounder, it was his succesful col-
laboration with the team he formed
that ensured the eventual success of
Minutebox.
The visit from Xavier and Josh is
just the first of many inspiring talks
Imperial Entrepreneurs has planned.
The focus of the society is to promote
entrepreneurship and the idea that
there are other prospects for Impe-
rial graduates than the very tempt-
“Storify allows people
to create stories around
posts”
