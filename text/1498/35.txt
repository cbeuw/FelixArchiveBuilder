“Who can spy on the spies?”
After a summer of upbeat comedy in
the cinemas (with films like The Inbe-
tweeners Movie and The Hangover Part
II), this wonderfully stark adaptation of
John le Carré’s best-selling novel gives
a glimpse into the murky spy game of
the 1970s, portrayed by an outstanding
cast.
Gary Oldman falls beautifully into
the role of inappropriately named ex-
MI6 agent George Smiley, a man of
high morals and patriotism, who, after
a fall from grace, has been reinstated to
identify a Soviet mole hidden in the up-
per echelons of the British Secret Ser-
vice. MI6 chief ‘Control’ (John Hurt)
managed to narrow the search for the
infiltrator down to a shortlist of suspects
before his own untimely sacking: Percy
Alleline (Toby Jones), who takes over
the top job after the dismissal of Con-
trol; Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), a player
who slept with Smiley’s wife; Direc-
tor of Operations Roy Bland (Ciaràn
Hinds); and skillful double-bluffer
Toby Estherhase (David Dencik). One
is guilty of passing secrets to the Rus-
sians – Smiley must root out the spy to
save the reputation of the Service be-
fore too many vital secrets are leaked.
He is assisted in his search for the mole
by junior MI6 official Peter Guillam
(Benedict Cumberbatch), former Head
of Personnel Connie Sachs (Kathy
Burke), and Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy),
a fellow agent with his own agenda.
The plot twists slyly as we follow Smi-
ley’s investigation, and catch fleeting
glimpses of the shadowy past through
his flashbacks.
Director Tomas Alfredson (best
known internationally for directing the
2008 vampire film Let The Right One
In) carefully extracts his adaptation
from the intricately detailed original
novel to produce a bleak, beige, suf-
focatingly male-dominated world into
which the viewer is drawn – a far cry
from the usual glamour of our James
Bond-esque spies. The superficial,
back-stabbing nature of office politics
is captured effectively which, along
with the conversations being filmed as
though the viewer is eavesdropping,
adds to the uncomfortable air of secrecy
and lies felt throughout the film. Hats
off to Casting Director Jina Jay – the
outstanding cast were chosen perfectly,
and the list alone gives some idea as to
the quality of the acting. Oldman por-
trays the taciturn Smiley brilliantly,
bringing danger and anger to the char-
acter that wasn’t seen in the original
adaptation when Alec Guinness played
the role. He is backed up, of course, by
a fantastic supporting cast including
some of the best of British actors, who
all seem to be at the peak of their game.
The only flaw in this film is that the
whistle is blown too soon. For a few
quick-witted, spy-minded types, the
guilty party can be sussed out well be-
fore Smiley catches up; however this
doesn’t really seem to matter – this
film is more about the journey than the
destination. The story is teeming with
tension, secrecy and twists, but while
there’s not a lot of laughing to be done,
and its pace and tricky plot will not be
for everyone, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
still comes highly recommended.

Another year means another Woody
Allen film – this time shot in Paris.
Midnight in Paris is a warm, nos-
talgic trip around the beautiful city,
with Allen taking a more casual ap-
proach to telling his original story.
Wilson plays Gil, a Hollywood scrip-
writer whose true passion lies in writ-
ing a novel. Whilst constantly mocked
by his fiancée (McAdams), he finds
true happiness by wandering around the
French city. He stumbles on a mysteri-
ous car one night, with its passengers
urging Gil to come and join them. De-
ciding to go along for the ride, he finds
himself socialising with the literary
legends of the 1920s Lost Generation
(Hemingway, Stein) who he has ad-
mired throughout his entire life.
The illusion the past creates, how we
are never wholly satisfied with where
we are at the moment, and our constant
desire for a better life, are the challeng-
es Gil faces when he sees something so
glamorous. But Allen is here to assure
us that it’s not really all that bad; if we
stick with it and have patience.
Allen has his ups and downs, but this
is one of his more moving pieces of
work in recent years. It is a humble of-
fering, yet remains just as effective and
touching.
