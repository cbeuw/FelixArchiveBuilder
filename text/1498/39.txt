This week the Union published its official
“National Student Survey (NSS) 2011
Response”. We are led to believe that we
are the only Students’ Union in the UK to
have published such a document.
So what is it?
The NSS Response is a booklet we have
written that summarises our analysis of
the NSS data, addresses concerning (as
well as positive) issues in college and
provides 35 “Union Recommendations”
to help improve the Student Experience at
Imperial College.
It was written by myself, Scott Heath
(Union President) and Andrew Keenan
(Representation Coordinator) over the
last month. Whilst putting it together
we made sure it was student focused
and we used numerous direct student
quotes from the NSS 2011. We also felt
it was important that it was as student-
friendly as possible to read. So, as you
Jason Parmar
Deputy President (Education)
deducation@imperial.ac.uk
can see, we have including several useful
info-graphics, began with a “Top 10
recommendations” and kept the main
messages from the response as concise
as possible.
Why?
As I’m sure you’ve all read previously in
Felix, Imperial College dropped 11 places
in the 2012 Sunday Times League Table,
the first time Imperial has scored outside
the top 4 in fourteen years.
University League ranking tables
have, over the last few years, given
more weighting student satisfaction
and teaching over categories such as
“Learning Resources” and “Staff-Student
Ratios”. However, the NSS response isn’t
only about trying to get Imperial back
up the league tables. The low results
in the NSS reveal a genuine problem
with the quality of teaching at Imperial.
If college takes on board and effectively
implements what this response from the
Union and student body recommends
then we should see a dramatic increase
in the quality of teaching and student
satisfaction at Imperial College.
This is our best opportunity to change
the student experience at Imperial
College to make it better for all of us. We
need to make sure your year/dep reps,
while on Student-Staff Committees,
raise the concerns you are having in
your department and work together
to provide solutions. Instead of solely
making complaints, we should be pro-
active and work together with staff in our
departments to address the issues that
affect the Student Experience.
I hope you enjoy reading the NSS
response, and if you have any questions
please e-mail us or, even better, come by
the Union Offices (2nd Floor of the Union
Building) to have a chat about it!
