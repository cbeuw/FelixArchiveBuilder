PUZZLES
The cells in a grid have to be coloured
or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many un-
broken lines of filled-in squares there
are in any given row or column. Look
at last week’s solution to see what a
typical solution looks like.
The overall solution should yield
some sort of picture, or as good as a
picture can look in monochrome on a
15x15 grid.

The aim with Slitherlink is to make one
continuous closed loop by connecting the
dots. The numbers in each square indicate
how many edges of the square are part of
the loop, so if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of four edges
have lines. That’s all the info you need
to get the one logical answer (though
waiting a week to see the solution will
also do). Answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, as the puzzles team re-
cieves one pity hug per correct solution.
