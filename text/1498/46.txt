Fencing Men’s 2nd team
start off season with a win
The fencing season opened this year
at Ethos, with the men’s second team
fencing against Surrey University’s first
team. After a delayed start, the foilists
got things going. Matthew Carney drew
first blood with a neat parry-riposte, and
continued on to win the bout against the
opposition’s left-handed foilist.
Jamie Fairclough, team captain for
Imperial, followed suit, reminding the
opposition that epeeists can indeed
counterattack. Joey, a new acquisition
from Sussex, rounded out the team us-
ing accuracy and an impressively long
lunge to score points.
The Imperial fencers didn’t relinquish
their lead for the remainder of the foil,
finishing with an impressive lead of 45-
15.
Sabre started with a bang and a cool
5-0 victory courtesy of new team mem-
ber Chris Lawrence. Thomas Martino
then faced off against the opposition’s
best fencer, who managed to restore par-

ity between the two teams. It then fell to
Matt to re-establish the lead, which he
managed to do – Thomas and Chris then
worked to extend that lead even further.
Faii Ong turned up to replace Matt for
the next bout against the anchor, doing
well to maintain the lead. The sabreurs
then managed to consolidate and extend
this over the next few bouts to finish
with a 45-40 victory.
Team captain Jamie then started the
epee off on the right foot, taking an
early lead. Neal Wannell, returning to
the club after a year of fencing for an
American university, maintained that
lead against stiff opposition in the form
of a “lefty” – even scoring the hit that
mathematically put the match out of
Surrey’s reach. James Loryman, also in
his debut for the club, put on a good dis-
play, making some incredibly light hits
somehow connect.
Jamie was given the honour of closing
the fencing out for the day, winning the
epee 45-35, with the match ending on an
ICFC victory of 135-90.
The hard-fought match was followed
by some well-deserved socalizing over
a few drinks at Eastside. Cut, thrust, parry, riposte...oh wait, there’s two lights. Referee needed
