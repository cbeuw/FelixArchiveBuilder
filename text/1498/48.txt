friendlies
yield
mixed
results
Wednesday 12 October was a mixed day
for ICHC, with the 6 teams recording 2
wins, 3 losses and a draw. The series of
friendlies played against a combination
of UCL and the RSM provided valuable
experience for ICHC and an opportuni-
ty for the freshers to impress and show
what they were capable of.
The matches at home did not end
well for Imperial as Fortress Harling-
ton failed to live up to its name. The
day saw the Men’s 1s take on their
UCL counterparts and record a 2-2
draw, the Men’s 2s lose 2-0 to UCL’s
M2, and the Men’s 4s falter to a 7-3
defeat by the RSM.
The away matches at UCL’s pitches
ended a lot better. The Ladies’ 1s re-
corded a solid 3-0 victory before the
Ladies’ 2s were humbled 5-0. The day
ended with the Men’s 3s avenging that
loss with their own 5-0 victory.
There is a lot expected of the Men’s
1s this year, but with the recent pro-
motion and a large release of players,
they are fully aware of how tough this
year will be. The contest against UCL
Men’s 1s therefore provided an op-
portunity to try out a host of new tac-
tics revolving around a new system of
play. These new tactics, despite being
physically demanding, saw IC take a
slender 1-0 lead into half time, with
Ewan Quince scuttling a ball under
the keeper’s pads off a short corner.
The workload required by the new
system did have its drawbacks, with
UCL hitting back at the start of the
second half to bring themselves level.
A moment of brilliance from Ewan got
IC back into the lead with a well taken
one-on-one. Sadly, this moment of
brilliance was followed by a moment
of madness from goalkeeper Vishal
Dhutia, who let a simple shot straight
in. The final score of 2-2 was a good
result for both teams.
Seeing their first team draw left the
Men’s 2s hoping they could go one
better. With a squad of 14, includ-
ing 6 freshers, IC started the game
brightly. A host of surging attacks
from the right piled on the pressure
and IC forced a short corner. Unfor-
tunately, a fumble with the stop led to
UCL winning the ball and scoring a
breakaway goal. IC tried to get back
on level terms and played very good
hockey, however, they could not stop
a second UCL goal; 2-0 being the final
score. It was poor fitness and inaccu-
rate passes that let the team down, and
Two wins, three losses and a draw:
pre-season matches offer some insight into
the teams ahead of a new season
