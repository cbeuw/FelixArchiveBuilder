the 2s will hopefully be back to their
brilliant best soon.
After a draw and a loss, all the pres-
sure was put on the Men’s 4s to ensure
IC would not leave Harlington empty
handed. The game began well for the
4s with the defence standing strong,
but then the RSM strikers became too
much and they scored two well-taken
goals in quick succession. Shortly af-
ter, however, veteran 4th team member,
Luke Reynolds, managed to score one
of his trademark reverse stick shots. IC
pressed, but unsuccessfully, and these
attacks left gaps behind for the RSM to
exploit. The RSM managed to hit a few
more goals, but the efforts from James
Peck and Luke meant that the final score
of 7-3 was a respectable one, consdier-
ing the RSM team do have some very
good players. Despite losing the match,
the performance was strong and there is
plenty of hope for the Men’s 4s for the
next season.
In the first game away to UCL, IC La-
dies’ 1s took on their UCL counterparts.
IC started in a panicked fashion and
squandered much of their opening pos-
session. However, it wasn’t long before
IC hit their stride. Some quick passes
saw Harry Stevenson open the scoring,
before Teddy Middlebrook doubled the
advantage. With a two goal cushion IC
hit cruise control. Anytime the UCL
players collected the ball, player of the
match Celia Hayes broke down the at-
tack and linked up with the midfield
beautifully. The icing on the cake was
a brilliant breakaway goal that Harry
scored with a sweet strike. 3-0 the final
score was well deserved.
The Ladies’ 2s were next up and keen
to show what they could do. IC started
well, but the difference in benches (UCL
had 8 more subs) proved to be the big-
gest factor, and eventually, UCL broke
down a tired IC. The final score line of
5-0 definitely flattered UCL. There were
many positives to take away from the
loss, with many players in the team ac-
tually playing for the first time. All the
freshers performed very well, with Les-
lie impressing the most. Despite being a
novice, she played a great game, defend-
ing fearlessly and played some fantastic
balls.
The last game of the day saw the
Men’s 3s take on UCL Men’s 3s in what
would be the biggest IC victory of the
day. UCL were on the back foot straight
from the push back with IC pressing
hard. IC found themselves 2-0 in 10
minutes, with Kenneth Chau and Alex
Kirby both getting early goals. The de-
fence also proved that anything the at-
tack could do, they could do better, with
Jack Tremlett and Alex Jones shutting
down any UCL play. Another goal from
Kenneth and a double from James Gok-
saran put IC 5-0 up early on in the sec-
ond half, which was also how the game
ended. A good result, but the team will
face much sterner tests.
