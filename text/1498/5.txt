Club chairs lukewarm over bar nights
Boards give an underwhelming response to new rulings on how to run events
Members of the Arts and Entertainments
Board (AEB) voiced overwhelming dis-
content with the Union’s new rules on
holding bar nights for clubs and societies.
Under new rules set out by Deputy Pres-
ident (Finance & Services) (DPFS) Mi-
chael Foster, clubs are no longer allowed
to purchase kegs from the Union for their
bar nights. Instead clubs can either sell
drinks with a 10% discount, or sell drinks
for full price with 10% of the bar spend go-
ing to the club. Clubs can also pre-order
a bar tab and distribute it as ‘tokens’, but
in order to comply with the Union’s newly
introduced Responsible Retailing of Alco-
hol Code of Practice, clubs cannot provide
more than 8 units (or an average of 4 pints)
of alcohol for free per person.

Matthew Colvin meeting on Monday, was unanimous in
their disapproval of the new rules. One
AEB member, wishing to remain anony-
mous, told Felix that, ‘the whole tokens
system is fundamentally flawed. Unless
you have stewards with hawk-eyes watch-
ing everyone at every moment, there’s no
way that you can stop people moving to-
kens around amongst themselves. We’re
being told that we aren’t responsible
enough to decide how much is our limit –
frankly it’s just insulting.”
The AEB follow in the footsteps of
comments made by senior members of the
Athletics Club Committee, whose mem-
bers organised an online protest, and the
Royal School of Mines.
Chair of the AEB, Chandana Shankar,
cited the system as “unworkable”, focus-
ing on the financial background of the sit-
uation: “Currently the legal and financial
justifications for the new bar night system
arevague.MichaelFosterneedstobackup
his decision with figures and facts because
currently the students feel that he is using
them to claw back money lost through bad
decisions made in previous years. I feel
that the Union’s bars should not be making
money on bar nights and the only way to
prove that they do this is by being up front
and transparent about costings.”
Posting on his online blog on October 6,
Foster stated the reasoning behind the in-
troduction of the new rules, explaining that
the Union was “losing money every time a
bar night was run, as the keg price did not
account for various staffing costs, includ-
ing the (often quite significant) cleaning
costs.”
The AEB has pledged to express the
board’s concerns at the next meeting of
Union Council on Monday 31 October.

No bull.
Deputy President (Finance & Services) Michael
Foster’s response to Felix:
“It is very easy to see why the AEB would not like this new procedure – I
can imagine no Management Group will. It represents the loss of a very
good deal for clubs. However, this deal was both irresponsible and unsus-
tainable, and, as DPFS, it is my responsibility to ensure the future stability
and sustainability of the Union’s activities. I would hope that Manage-
ment Groups take their wider responsibilities into account, and instead
of mourning the loss of a ridiculously good deal for clubs, appreciate that
we all need to act sustainably to keep this Union as it is for many years
to come.
“As an aside, despite all the reported unhappiness with the new bar nights
procedure, the Royal School of Mines will soon be hosting their second
one this month, and the German Society were thrilled with their night. They
have, as a result, got more members than ever before, and were able to
enjoy a great social event at the Union Bar for their whole society.”
