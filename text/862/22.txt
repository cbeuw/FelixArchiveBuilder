That means first class terms from financial
institutions.
Since 1971 SGFPD Ltd has been advising
students all over the U.K. on money
matters.
We provide a considerable financial incen-
tive to students, in the form of a phased
grant of up to £330.00. This grant is made to
assist initial contributions to financial plans
directly relevant to student objectives, in the
knowledge that satisfied graduate clients
will often progress to use our further
services after graduation.
We can also show you a way of guaranteeing
a top-up to a 100% mortgage in the future
(subject to status) so that you do not have to
save a deposit for your first house purchase.
We can even help you arrange your first
house purchase while you are still a student,
if you want to avoid paying rent.
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?
You can find out what your potential is

phone or personal visit, or by post if you fill
