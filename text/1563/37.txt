Recently a lot of console love has
been going round in the game
section. With the releases of the PS4
and Xbox One, the reactionary Wii U
article, I just felt that one big part of
gaming, namely PC gaming was being
a bit left out. Therefore I wanted to
bring it back into the spotlight by
describing my love for one of the big
champions of PC’s gaming, Steam.
For all you unlucky ones who don’t
know what steam is, imagine an
amazon just for games. However
instead of actual physical goods, you
only get the software. Therefore once
youbuythegameyoucanimmediately
download it. Furthermore once you
buy a game it stays in your inventory
forever, meaning that you can never
misplace it.
Now before I gush on about this
absolutely wonderful service, I’ll run
through all the negatives so you guys
don’t think I tried to deceive you.
Firstly, the thing that caused so much
pain to the Xbox One, DRM, which
means that you cannot exchange
games with friends and/or sell them
on, is impossible with steam games.
However to be perfectly honest, this
was almost always so on PC and
therefore something that most PC
gamers are used to. This will be only
Steamy love for PC Gaming
Maximilian Eggl wants to give credit to where its due
a concern for you console gamers
out there. Secondly if anything goes
wrong, there is no helpline telephone
number. This means if somehow you
are locked out of your account, play
your game etc. you are pretty much
screwed. You have to email Valve
(the developers of steam) and wait
for a reply (which can take anywhere
between a few hours to several days),
which may or may not be helpful. The
last and absolutely worst thing is the
steam sales. Coming around every
other month, the oﬀer great games
at incredible prices. These sales also
come at a time when I think I am
doing quite well in terms of ﬁnances,
boom the sale comes along and after
having bought about 5 games I am
broke yet again.
However these steam sales are also
one of the best things about this
online store. This way you can get
some of the best games ever at super
low prices. In fact for the last sale
(which ended on tuesday) I managed
to get the Skyrim legendary edition
for 10 pounds!! If I walked into a
store this would be possible in the
same capacity. In store, the number
of games that you can buy is limited
by the demand and actual physical
size of the building, while steam
is limited only by its server size.
Therefore most games that you can
think of will be available, that would
have been physically unavailable for
years. Another positive thing that
steam does is its support of multiple
operating systems. Regardless if you
play on Windows, Mac OS or Linux
steam is available on your platform
as well as oﬀering games for you.
Apart from Blizzard no major game
studio or distributor really does this
to such an extent. The last thing I
want to mention, is related to my
carelessness. In my past when games
still were on CD’s and you needed
a game key to install it, I would
frequently either lose the CD, little
booklet with the game key, case
which would have the game key or
any combination of these three. This
would mean that if I would want to
reinstall the game, I would have to go
on a massive treasure hunt to ﬁnd the
missing piece, with failure meaning
I would have to re-buy the game if I
wanted it really play it. With steams
system, once you have bought a game
it is in your inventory indeﬁnitely and
you can download it as many times
as you want. This has just made my
life so much easier, and means that
for each individual game I do not
need to put in a new game CD. There
are so many more great things about
steam, e.g. achievement systems,
bundles, auto-updates of games and
integration with demos.
Steam is one of the best things that
has happened to gaming for a while,
I mean its one the biggest success
stories of the gaming industry at the
current time. Steam is a great service
to be part for even if you are not the
biggest gamer, and furthermore its
free! For all the things you get, why
would you not sign up???
For those who loved the original
Kingdom Rush are really in for a
treat with the new Kingdom Rush
Frontiers available on android, apple,
and now Armorgames. This game
employs the same incredibly polished
Tower Defence gameplay, artstyle, and
presentation as its prequel with new
elements that enhance the gameplay.
Frontiers makes some changes in the
deeper elements of the gameplay. The
enemies are a lot more varied and some
of the enemy bosses can pave their own
paths through the map forcing you
to completely rethink the course of
strategy defence. The four basic tower
defences still remain the same as in the
prequel but the tower upgrades have
been completely revamped with some
really cool towers that can for example
raise undead minions from enemy
corpses and use totems to dispel enemy
magic all to allow for a more varied
strategy.
But it’s the really subtle additions
that leave the prints of an artist. The
background environment for almost
every map is interactive so you can ﬁnd
yourself poking camels in the desert
and explode them if you poke them
enough. There are side-missions and
achievements in the game that relate to
the environment interactions such as
helping Indiana Jones escape a temple
in a jungle. Sometimes the creatures
that live on the map can aide you in
battle.
Frontiers retains the much loved
Heroes addition from the prequel but
with a wider range of Heroes to aid
you in battle. Unfortunately, many
of the heroes are only available upon
purchasing them with real money
however the game can be completed
ﬁne without purchasing additional
heroes. Hero upgrades are more
reﬁned than the prequel. The longer
the Hero battles, the more he or she
upgrades until the next level is reached.
Higher levels correspond to increased
attack power as well as other bonus
upgrades speciﬁc to the hero.
Kingdom Rush Frontiers was
released on the 26th September 2013
and can be bought for under £3.00 on
iTunes and Apple store.
Cookie Clicker is the highly
addictive game with the goal of
producing an infinite number of
cookies! Yup – it’s a game that
never ends as much as it never lets
you go.
To make a cookie is simple. Just
click the giant cookie on the screen.
Cookies are the currency of the
game. With enough cookies you can
buy a grandma to bake cookies for
you. Sell a grandma, oh you horrible
person! and unlock an achievement
for doing the wrong thing!
With a lot more cookies you can
buy even more powerful cookie
producing devices that further
accelerate your cookie producing
power including a time machine
that will go back in time to retrieve
all the cookies in the past.
Unfortunately I fell victim to this
game some months ago and it was
getting to the point where I would
leave CookieClicker on my laptop
all night (turning off the hibernation
settings) and sporadically emerging
from slumber to buy upgrades.
If you don’t cherish your sanity
enough to even think of playing this
game, below are a list of remedies to
CookieClickerAddiction:
1. Suicide
“Kill me. If you’ve ever been my
friend, kill me.”
- James Dashner, The Death Cure.
2. Find another addictive game/
music/hobby out there!
3. Hack the game. This is what I
did. I followed instructions on a
Youtube video that gave me pretty
much enough cookies to unlock
all the current achievements –
although more achievements are
added as its makers. Surprisingly
CookieClicker clocked on to the
hack and gave me the “bad cookie”
award.
The dark game, this absolutely
dastardly invention of a clearly
insane mind, can be found on the
link http://orteil.dashnet.org/
cookieclicker/ which you obviously
are not going to play anyway,
coz you have a life an all right?
