People Taking Lift To Gym Definitely Got The Right Idea
A
new study has this
week conﬁrmed
that those who take
the lift to the Ethos
gym have deﬁnitely
understood the whole gym idea.
The survey conducted by researchers
in the Faculty of Medicine
conclusively showed that all those
who had decided that the best way to
get ﬁt was to take the lift all the way
to gym had deﬁnitely understood the
basic principles of exercise.

he vote this week to elect
a new food representative
to the FiveSixEight has
returned the Mushroom,
Tomato and Basil Pizza as
the new Vice-President (Hot Foods).
After a closely fought battle with the
Deluxe Spicy pizza, Mushroom won
out with by a slim 2% margin.
The campainging was ﬁerce from both
sides and often threatened to descend
into vitrolic name-calling. However,
after initial concerns over whether the
election would be "free and fair", the
result was accepted by all involved.
Whilst both the Spicy Deluxe and the
Mushroom, Tomato and Basil were
always considered the front runners,
the Pizza Union put in an unusually
strong showing - garnering 23% of
the vote. It has been speculated that
its strong stance on immigration
was instrumental in its gaing a large
percentage of the vote.
It was a disappointing showing for
the Napoletana, proving once again
that College is unprepared for egg on
pizza.
"Clearly these people have truly
understood the idea behind going to
a place full of exercise aids" said one
researcher.
"In fact, not only have they understood
the concept, they have also happened
upon the most eﬃcient way to
conserve their energy prior to
exercise" he continued.
"By avoiding taking the stairs to the
second/third ﬂoors, these innovators
are saving their energy for that extra
push on the treadmill".
The study was also able to successfully

orth Pole - As the year
draws to a close, this
editor gives his advice
on the festive season.
Drink. Any moment spent without an
alcoholic beverage in your possession
is an insult to the baby Jesus and
everything Christmas stands for.
Indeed, it is this writer’s belief that any
kind of eﬀort made over Christmas
should be enitrely focussed on the
acquisition and consumption of
inebriative substances. Which leads
nicely onto the second piece of
advice...
...Ignore your family and loved ones.
Those guys have held you back all year.
They take up time, money and love
that would have been more usefully
spent on yourself. Christmas, as I
shouldn’t need to remind you, is all
about the individual.
In fact, instead of buying presents
and cards for others you should buy
yourself copious gifts, have them sent
to your home address and make your
family watch as you unwrap present
after present.
Finally, don’t forget to spend the
whole time conplaining about the
commercialisation of Christmas,
because it will fascinate everyone you
see.
So, forget going to family gatherings;
treat yourself; maintain a blood-
alcohol content of at least 0.2%
because Christmas is all around.
T
his week Imperial College
Union announced its plans
for the next 75 Summer
Balls, until Imperial
ﬁnalises its merger with the
other London universities. The most
surprising part of the announcement
was the change from the usual
Ball theme of the evenings, with a
new ‘Hunger Games’ style system
proposed. Rather than listening to a
band that was nearly famous 5 years
ago, undergraduates will be forced to
ﬁght to the death with the ultimate
prize of a 1st class degree and their
lives. Two tributes will be reaped
from each Department, with training
provided by the senior tutors. The
safe students will be able to watch
the games, with the business school
already starting the necessary
paperwork to be a registered
bookie in time for the ﬁrst event.
The location for the ﬁrst games is
rumoured to be Silwood Park, where
the presence of a nuclear reactor is
expected to add a certain spice to
the occasion. An anonymous Union
source told Hangman “Imperial has
over 40 departments, so with all 80
tributes we’ll have almost doubled
the attendance ﬁgures from last year.
Heck with the insider knowledge of
the location we might even turn a
proﬁt on it!”

show that spending lots of time doing
weights is deﬁnitely well worth it
because you are "certainly going to be
faced with many scenarios in which all
that extra muscle will come in handy".
The university has put plans into
motion to remove the stairs in Ethos
altogether on the grounds that people
might do exercise in a non-exercise
designated area.
At press time, the researchers were
beginning investigations into whether
those that smoke and also exercise
regularly are onto something.
