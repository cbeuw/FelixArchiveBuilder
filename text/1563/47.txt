Felix Sport wishes you a Merry Christmas!
O
n 23rd November,
Imperial indoor
cricket team
played the second
round of the BUCS
indoor league at the University of
East London’s SportsDock centre.
Our ﬁrst game was against UCL
and it was time to exact our re-
venge after defeat in the previous
round. We won the toss and elect-
ed to bowl ﬁrst, and our opening
bowlers, Zain Rizvi and Vignesh
(Viggy) Venkateswaran took early
wickets, with Zain ﬁnishing with
ﬁgures of 3 overs, 3 wickets for 9
runs, accompanied by some ﬁne
bowling by Matthew Knights who
picked up 2 wickets oﬀ his 3 overs.
Due to the impressive bowling ef-
fort by Imperial, UCL could only
muster a mere 78 runs in their 10
overs. Imperial began their run
chase perfectly, with Vishal Nair
retiring not out on 27, and Juhin
Patel (22*) and Viggy (10*) seeing
Imperial through to a solid win
without the loss of any wickets.
The second ﬁxture of the morn-
ing was against Brunel University.
This time, Imperial lost the toss
and Brunel elected to bat ﬁrst. Fol-
lowing the success in the ﬁrst game,
Imperial made breakthroughs
courtesy of Viggy and Zain, with
Jayanth Ganapathy bowling su-
perbly at the death, picking up 2
wickets as well as keeping the runs
down. Brunel crawled their way to
67 all out before Imperial launched
their run chase.
Vishal played with class on his
way to 26 not out, accompanied by
a mature knock from Viggy (25*)
and some late hitting by Jayanth, to
see Imperial home by 5 wickets.
Tour Match
doesn’t offer
many clues for
England

After a traumatic ﬁrst Test in the se-
ries for England, in which they lost by
a large margin, as well as seeing Jona-
than Trott return home for a stress-
related illness, it was important that
the team used their tour match against
the Cricket Australia Chairman’s XI
eﬀectively. What happened instead
was unlikely to instil much conﬁdence
in an already faltering batting line-up,
who struggled to 212-7 on day one. In
addition to this, England’s pace bowl-
ers were only able to take one wicket
between them.
But it isn’t all doom and gloom for
England – Tim Bresnan has been
added to the Ashes Squad, having
come back playing strongly for the
Performance Squad. Gary Ballance is
also looking solid whilst playing in the
Tour Match in Alice Springs – he was
the only player to pass ﬁfty for Eng-
land in the ﬁrst innings.
Early indications suggest that it will
be Ballance who wins the race to re-
place Trott, ahead of Jonny Bairstow
(who showed signs of weakness
against the short ball in the sum-
mer), and the all-rounder Ben Stokes.
Bresnan is also likely to be selected,
this time ahead of Chris Tremlett, who
seemed lacklustre in the ﬁrst match.
The selection of Bresnan will also have
the added advantage of giving England
more batting depth.
Graham Gooch, England’s batting
coach, has dropped the biggest hint
yet that it will be Joe Root who bats
in Jonathan Trott’s position at three.
How successful this venture will be
remains to be seen. When he has
opened for England, Root has seemed
to struggle, suggesting he might be
vulnerable if England were to lose
their ﬁrst wicket early.
Adelaide presents a huge opportu-
nity for England to get back into the
series. The last time they played here
they trounced the Australians, with
Graeme Swann picking up a ﬁve-wick-
et-haul. The Australians have opened
the door to the Ashes – England have
to make sure that it shuts again this
week.

IC score
walk-off
win
Oxford started brightly, scoring
two runs in the ﬁrst innings due
to some sloppy ﬁelding in the Im-
perial outﬁeld. After the ﬁrst two
batters struck out, the innings
started to look up as Zack Wang
hit a single into centre ﬁeld. Un-
fortunately, the two runners were
left on base as Oxford struck out
the next batter.
After the second inning, the
Oxford batting progressed stead-
ily, and the runs crept up. This
was complemented by the Oxford
pitcher’s impressive performance
(albeit with a less than impressive
Movember attempt), recording
ten strikeouts as he shut out the
Imperial oﬀence, giving Oxford a
fairly uneventful (hence only two
paragraphs) 11-0 win.
Imperial feared the worst as
Oxford started the second game
strongly, hitting 6 runs in their
ﬁrst innings. The Falcons clawed
two runs back courtesy of Zack
getting a hit in the bottom of
the inning. In the bottom of the
second innings, however, the
Imperial oﬀense started to come
good. After the lower order bat-
ters all got on base, the big hitters
at the top of the order came back
to drive the runs in. As the score
racked up, the Falcons began to
take control, as J.D. Smith was
walked to tie the game at 7-7. Im-
perial ﬁrst baseman Chris Carter
stole home to put the home team
up by one run going into what
would be the ﬁnal innings.
In the top of the third, Ox-
ford took the lead. Oxford’s big
American shortstop launched a
huge hit towards left centre ﬁeld.
As the away team looked certain
to score, the ball was plucked
from the air by left ﬁelder Steph
Mangeon, making a fantastic
game-saving catch. After the ﬁ-
nal Oxford batter ground out to
J.D. Smith at second base, Impe-
rial needed two runs to win from
their ﬁnal innings.
Alex Fung launched a line drive
into right ﬁeld for a single, bring-
ing the Imperial top order back
up. After a new pitcher walked
the next two batters to load the
bases. On the third pitch, Ash-
ley belted a line drive into centre
ﬁeld. Vincent slid in, meaning
the Falcons took a tense 10-9 vic-
tory after a tremendous walk-oﬀ
single from Ashley.

Arsenal v Everton
(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)
Roberto Martinez’s Toﬀees remain
outsiders for a Champions League
spot after quietly impressing thus far.
But their commanding league posi-
tion is based largely on their out-
standing home form, and they remain
pretty inconsistent away from the for-
tress that is Goodison Park. Their full
backs like to play an open, expansive
game but will have to be disciplined
and batten down the hatches against
the Gunners. Arsenal remain impos-
sible not to back at the Emirates and
Aaron Ramsey, Olivier Giroud and
co. should have no problems here. But
the real test of their title credentials
will be provided by the teams around
them.
Prediction: 2-0
Man United v Newcastle
(Saturday 12:45, BT Sport 1)
David Moyes’ men are ﬁnally starting
to look like title contenders, but they
are making a bad habit of dropping
points, rather like Moyes’ Everton
sides of yesteryear. It won’t be easy
here against a bang in-form Newcas-
tle side. Alan Pardew has gone from
favourite for the sack to ﬂavour of
the month; that he has left the likes of
Hatem Ben Arfa on the bench recently
shows the Magpies have real strength
in depth. They will believe they can
follow in the footsteps of West Brom
and claim all three points here, so
hopefully we are in for a classic like
last season.
Prediction: 3-2
Southampton v Man City
This is a fascinating match-up. The
Saints have failed to beat the big guns
of late despite their strong start. But
for all their exceptional home routs,
Man City are poor on the road and do
not possess the same fear factor. Make
no mistake, Mauricio Pochettino bad-
ly needs to reinvigorate his side – they
will be hurting from defeats at Arse-
nal and Chelsea. But you always feel
City are prone to errors – just look at
how this ﬁxture panned out last sea-
son, when City’s title bid eﬀectively
ended at St Mary’s Stadium. The ﬁrst
goal will be crucial and the Saints are
experts at bagging it, so I’m backing
them to share the spoils.
Prediction: 1-1
Sunderland v Tottenham
(Saturday 5:30)
Gus Poyet has been luckless of late
and the Black Cats have found the net
hard to come by. But they have already
beaten Man City and Newcastle at the
Stadium of Light and I expect them
to overcome an under-pressure Spurs
side short of goals.
Prediction: 1-0
Stoke v Chelsea
Rather like Man City, the Blues’ away
form is not that of champions. But
Stoke were atrocious at Everton last
weekend, posing no attacking threat
whatsoever, and Jose Mourinho can
silence some of the doubters here.
Prediction: 0-3
Crystal Palace v Cardiﬀ
Crystal Palace make up for lack of
quality with desire and excellent or-
ganisation. Cardiﬀ pose little oﬀensive
threat away from home and this is a
brilliant opportunity for Tony Pulis to
claim 3 vital points.
Prediction: 1-0
West Brom. v Norwich
The Baggies seem to give everybody
a really good game nowadays. Steve
Clarke has moulded a quality side
nailed on for regular top-half ﬁnishes.
By contrast, the Canaries have been
very average of late and rarely produce
a surprise result.
Prediction: 2-0
Fulham v Aston Villa
(Sunday 1:30)
Martin Jol’s sacking last weekend was
no surprise at all and Rene Meulen-
steen has his work cut out to stop the
rot. Unfortunately for Fulham, Aston
Villa produce their best performances
away and will be up for this after frus-
tration last weekend.
Prediction: 3-0
Liverpool v West Ham
Despite their setback at the KC Sta-
dium last weekend and Daniel Stur-
ridge’s injury, Liverpool remain a free
scoring side – in stark contrast to the
Hammers. Sam Allardyce’s men never
concede lorry loads of goals but there
can surely only be one outcome.
Prediction: 2-0
Swansea v Hull
(Sunday 4pm)
You get the sense Swansea’s indiﬀerent
form is down to the diﬃculty of bal-
ancing European and Premier League
commitments. Hull are notoriously
hard to break down but Michael La-
udrup at least has the ﬂair players to
do it and claim an important home
win.
Prediction: 2-1
