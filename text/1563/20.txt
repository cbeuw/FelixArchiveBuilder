The invention of vibrators...
World class opera in our backyard
O
ur prestigious
neighbour, the Royal
College of Music,
is a fortress tucked
away behind our
own Sherﬁeld building. Until now its
activities had been hidden from me;
but I am so glad that that has ﬁnally
changed.
This week I attended the premiere
of a Ravel double bill opera, produced
and performed by the Royal College
of Music (RCM) International Opera
School. Given the relatively low ticket
prices and the proximity to campus –
it’s basically on campus – there’s not
much of an excuse not to go, and if the
world of opera has yet to open itself to
you, then this is an ideal introduction.
I must admit I wasn’t entirely
sure what to expect. Yes, this is the
famous RCM, but surely I shouldn’t
anticipate all too much from a student
production? But to put it in those
terms is misleading; these aren’t simply
students, but the next generation of
stars, some of whom I suspect may
one day grace the stage in Covent
Garden. To put it simply, the vocal
performances were of the highest
quality, and in such a small theatre
these young voices carried magically.
The orchestra, too were fantastic, with
the ﬁnesse and virtuosity of the best
professional ensembles.
The ﬁrst opera performed was
L’Heure Espagnole (the Spanish Hour),
a raucous, witty and sexy aﬀair about
a rather ‘hungry’ housewife juggling
her three suitors while her husband
is out. Ravel’s sensuous scoring gives
each character a colourful and distinct
personality, yet isn’t afraid to descend
to humourous sound eﬀects when
slapstick is called for. The production
was genuinely funny and beautifully
transparent in its approach. Only
the ﬁnal quintet was clumsy, and the
choreography a little confused. The cast
managed to portray their obnoxious
and self-absorbed characters without
becoming caricatures, which is no
mean feat – even if some of the greater
subtleties of comic acting weren’t fully
there.
We were then witness to Ravel’s
‘other’ opera, L’Enfant et les Sortilèges
(the Child and the Spells), also in one
act. This magical fairy tale involves
furniture coming alive and talking
animals teaching an insolent boy his

lesson. In my view these technical
challenges were handled less
successfully than in L’Heure, although
for a group with such limited resources
they were inventive and impressively
carried out.
My companion was more convinced,
though we were both left a little
confused at some of the directorial
choices, such as ‘trees’ being
represented by cogs on chains. Apart
from this, the performance was equally
strong as L’Heure, and showcased
some fantastic action for the chorus.
The end result was a beautifully lit and
touching portrayal of the boy wanting
his ‘maman’.
Opera is after all a kind of ‘total’
art form, a gesamtkunst (to borrow a
term from Richard Wagner), and this
is clearly a concept understood by
the creative team. The stagecraft was
impressive for such a small platform,
complete with multi-layered sets and
moving staircases, and some theatrical
illusions were pulled oﬀ brilliantly. The
lightingwascreativeandatmospheric–
although a little limited as occasionally
singers were left in the dark.
All of this gave an impression of
professionalism, and, when combined
with the enthusiastic and skilful
musical performance, an enthralling
and engaging spectacle resulted. I
couldn’t think of a better way to spend
a few evening hours away from the
library.

W
hat’s in a name?
Probably some
erotica, as the
name is “The
Vibrator Play”
.
Unquestionably the play lives up to its
name, with a certain amount of overt
sexual content. But In the Next Room
or The Vibrator Play is also much,
much more than a bawdy comedy or
theatrical pornography. American
playwright Sarah Ruhl has created a
piece that deals with the most intimate
of human relationships: husband and
wife, doctor and patient, woman and
conﬁdante, mother and child, man and
woman.
The starting point of the drama is
the 19th century practice of treating
women with hysteria with a ‘pelvic
massage’
, a tiring and time-consuming
medical massage (known to you and
me as masturbation), which resulted
in a ‘hysterical paroxysm’ (that’s an
orgasm), thus relieving the patient’s
symptoms. In case you’re wondering,
this treatment is no longer available on
the NHS.
Towards the end of the 19th century,
when this play is based, electrically
powered instruments were developed
to help achieve this paroxysm in less
time – and yes, I’m talking about the
invention of the vibrator.
Ruhlusesthisratheramusingpremise
to kick start her piece; Dr. Givings is a
renowned New York doctor who treats
patients for hysteria, helped by his no-
nonsense nurse Annie. Meanwhile,
as the patients come and go, his wife
Catherine sits downstairs fretting
about her baby, who she cannot feed
suﬃciently for lack of breast milk.
The next room, the doctor’s
examination room, is the real keystone
of this performance. Not only is the
stage brilliantly set up in a two tiers,
so that the public can follow the action
in both rooms at the same time, but
the physical space represents the
emotional content that the play is
centered around. The concept of a next
room highlights the female condition
in a male-dominated society, in which
the action happens in another room,
above the heads of the women, who are
left waiting outside closed doors. The
next room is what Dr. Givings closes
himself into to escape from his marital
tensions, where he devotes time to his
female patients while his unhappy wife
waits outside, lonely.
The other characters weave in and
out of this wife-husband relationship,
with a progressively chirpier Mrs.
Daldry coming in for regular treatment
with her overbearing husband, the self-
centered, heartbroken, English artist
Clara Clark Nevola
Writer
coming in to be treated for “a rare case
of male hysteria”, and the black wet
nurse Elizabeth, who visits regularly
to compensate for Catherine’s lack
of milk. These characters intertwine,
creatingacomplexwebofinterpersonal
relationships, by turns comic, touching
and shocking.
The two female leads, Catherine
(Natalie Casey) and Mrs. Daldry (Flora
Montgomery) are truly captivating
characters from the very ﬁrst scene,
drawing the audience into the chaotic
Givings household and making up for
the sometimes shakier performance of
the other cast members. The second
act picks up considerably, with the
whole cast showing a remarkable talent
and turning the piece into a far more
vivid, real performance than what the
ﬁrst act achieved. As the curtains close
on a romantic, snowy embrace you
might even ﬁnd yourself shedding a
tear or two.
In The Next Room encompasses
comedy, emotion, sex, scientiﬁc
innovation, race, history, gender
relations and mental health issues. But
it is not just a list of buzzwords: it’s a
truly moving, thought provoking piece
that deals with human relationships at
their rawest.
