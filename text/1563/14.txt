C
hristmas at Imperial as an
undergrad quite literally
sucks. All I can remember
was all my friends from
alternative universities
having a fantastic time with mulled
wine, carols, slightly questionable
decisions at the Christmas dinners,
and retiring home to make snowmen
with all their lovely family. Meanwhile
I had more than ﬁve peices of
coursework on the go, numerous
tests, and ‘fun’ end of term activities
on my course, that were hideously
weighted so you could not pass if
you were slightly the worse for wear
in the morning. Instead of acting out
the Christmas dream, I was struggling
to get out of the department, at all. I
often found myself wondering what
halls actually looked like at this time
of year, or whether it was light outside
(there’s an app for that). I was at my
most excited on the last day of term, at
my joyful reunion with my bed.
The low point had to be fourth year.
My course was such that I had ﬁnals in
January, and not mid to late January,
but starting on the 5th. That holiday,
I took one day oﬀ for Christmas. It
always baﬄed me why Imperial was
confused about the low satisfaction
ratings. Tests on a Friday afternoon on
the last day of term are not exactly a
positive inﬂuence on our mood levels.
This year, looking at it from the other
side, the undergrads look as ill as I felt.
I have three invigilations booked in
the next two weeks and still more for
the ﬁrst week of January. So I’m afraid
it is not looking bright for a change in
the future. So for all of you who are
suﬀering this I wanted to instil a bit
of Christmas hope; It really does get
better.
I’ve always thought I hated
Christmas.Allthepressuretobehappy
and thrilled about life, but actually it is
pretty great when you don’t think you
are going to fail anything if you take
the weekend to go shopping. Suddenly
I was helping with a carol concert,
putting up decorations, enjoying a
mulled cider, and chatting about the
possibility of snow. I have two weeks
oﬀ! This has not happened since mock
GCSEs over 7 years ago.
So my confession for this week,
though not as cheery as I would like
Christmas Confessions of a GTA
A
s a student at Imperial,
the lead up to
Christmas can seem
like one of the busiest
times of the year, a
feeling compounded by the multitude
of seasonal events that you just have
to go to. No matter how overwhelmed
you’re feeling, there are always some
parties that you will just refuse to
miss, because everyone knows that
reservations and propriety ﬂy out
the window as soon as mulled wine
and mistletoe are involved. Whether
you’re the kind of person who’s at the
front line of the drama, or you just like
watching it unfold, Christmas parties
are often unmissable, and a good way
to release the stress that’s gradually
built up throughout the term.
So we get it; no matter what else you
should be doing, Christmas (or other
seasonal celebrations) parties are
always fun and we should make sure
that we ﬁnd time to enjoy them. But
what if you really need to be studying
for those exams, and the constant
study guilt prevents you from relaxing
properly? I think that I solved this
problem, and I would encourage you
to do the same: turn the festivities into
study material.
Are you an engineer? Use some
of your recently-acquired skills to
build something challenging. Out of
gingerbread. Are you a physicist or
mathematician? Conduct an analysis
of the ﬂows of people around the
mistletoe. A medic? Examine alcohol
related injuries and oﬀer your friends
hangover cures. Not obviously
specialised to the season, but you’ll
make a lot of people happy if you do it
wearing antlers or a Santa hat. You get
the idea; every subject can be adapted
to some festive fun.
You’re studying at Imperial because
at some point, you decided that you
love your subject. It’s really easy to
lose track of that amidst all the maths
lectures and tedious labs, so why not
use Christmas as an opportunity to
take a step back and do something
not directly related to your course
purely because you enjoy it. It won’t
necessarily get you better marks in
that coursework (unless someone’s
involved in a project investigating the
material properties of gingerbread,
please someone let me know if that is
actuallyathing),orhelpyouremember
that equation you’re inevitably going
to forget in your upcoming exam,
but it might rejuvenate your passion
for your subject, which will help get
you through all those times over the
holidays when you’ll be cracking open
your textbooks when all your non-
Imperial friends are passed out in a
food coma at the foot of the Christmas
tree.
Everyone needs a break now and
then, but you’ll feel a bit less guilty
about the time oﬀ if you utilise it
in a somewhat productive manner.
And if, like me, you opt for a giant
gingerbread creation, you’ll ﬁnd that
oﬄoading large quantities of sugar
onto your friends does wonders for
your social standing.

With a bit of ingenuity and a lot of ﬂour, you could make something this delicious

There will come a time when you donʼt have to work at Christmas
is: if this rings a bell with you, keep
going. There will be Christmases
around the corner where you can get
completely drunk at a party and hit
on someone you’ll never talk to again,
but right now enjoy the little things
like half price mince pies or ﬁnishing
that stupid coursework. If we made it
through you can too.
