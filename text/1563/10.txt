Gender differences? It’s all in our head
Philippa Skett on how our minds are already made up when it comes to sex
INGALHALIKAR, M. PNAS, DECEMBER 2, 2013
N
ew research has
shown that the brains
of females and males
have diﬀerent patterns
of connectivity,
possibly alluding as to why men
may not behave the same as women.
In this impressively large study
published by PNAS, 949 people had
the connections of their neuronal
clusters mapped, and results indicated
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the
wiring of the minds between the two
genders.
So what were the connectivity
diﬀerences? Males often had stronger
connectivity proﬁles within the
separate hemispheres compared to
females, although females were found
to have signiﬁcantly more inter-
hemispheric connectivity across the
whole brain. This means that although
males have greater connectivity
between the front and the back of
the two sides of the brain, both of
the two hemispheres in females are
more intricately connected from left
to right.
The study, carried out by
Pennsylvania University, was led
by Dr Ragini Verma, an associate
professor in the department of
Radiology. Verma thinks there is
a link between these results and
diﬀerences in behaviour between the
genders: “These maps show us a stark
diﬀerence – and complementarity –
in the architecture of the human brain
that helps provide a potential neural
basis as to why men excel at certain
tasks, and women at others.”
In behavioural experiments also run
by Pennsylvania University, females
outperformed males when it came
to testing attention spans, memory
retention and facial recognition,
whilst males were better at spatial
processing and had quicker reaction
times. Meanwhile, males generally
performed better when only working
on one task, whereas females could
process several at one time and were
also found to have superior social
cognition skills.
Such results could be seen as
indicative that the connectivity
patterns Verma has identiﬁed relate
to these diﬀerences in behaviour,
although little was mentioned in the
paper about neurological plasticity
as a result of external environmental
inﬂuences. Could it be that a gender-
biased lifestyle is shaping such
connectivity instead?
When looking at age, the contrast
between male and female connectivity
increased as the subjects got older.
Subjects of both genders below the
age of 13 were found to have very
similar connectivity proﬁles, whilst
diﬀerences were most prominent in
those that were 17 or older. This may
indicate that puberty could play a part
in shaping the dimorphism of adult
human brains, almost as much as it
inﬂuences physical gender-orientated
development too, although more
research is needed.
Tracking the connectivity patterns
was done using diﬀusion tensor
imaging, an
MRI technique
that maps the
movement of
water particles
m o v i n g
throughout the
brain. Being able
to see where water
moves can allow
tracing of the
underlying ﬁbres
of the brain that
are directing the
water movement.
Such ﬁbres
are composed
of large bundles
of hundreds of
axons of neurons,
and show which
regions of the
brain connect
to and inﬂuence
others.
Modelling the
entire proﬁle of all
the connections
within the brain
at a cellular level
is still yet to be
completely done,
but would be the
ultimate endeavour in brain mapping.
The Human Connectome Project,
launched back in 2010, is aiming to
do this, although estimations of its
completion in 2015 have been met
with varying levels of scepticism.
Studies into the connectivity of the
brain are no longer novel, but are still
providing increasingly interesting
results. Although this study looks at
neural bundles, being able to study the
brain at an even greater resolution is
next in the neuroscience agenda. Not
only that, but coupled with further
research in behaviour and neural
development and better imaging
techniques, we may one day be able
to pinpoint exactly what in our minds
make us who we are.

asked the Daily Mail. The
answer: probably not,
but ambient noise could
increase the eﬃciency of solar cells,
researchers at Imperial College and
Queen Mary University of London
have found.
Professor James Durrant of
Imperial’s Department of Chemistry
spoke to Felix to explain the ﬁndings.
“Myself and Steve Dunn from
Queen Mary have been looking at
piezoelectric eﬀects, which are when
mechanical strain gives an electric
current – electric lighters are the
example Steve always gives. There is
evidence that these eﬀects are helping
in the ﬁeld of photocatalysis, where
sunlight is used to degrade pollutants.
We were interested in whether this
sort of approach might be applicable
to solar cells, and whether sound
might be able to induce this eﬀect.”
Sound produces a strain which
could induce a current in piezoelectric
materials; however, due to the random
orientation of sound waves and the
fact that the high and low pressure
eﬀects could cancel each other out, the
Imperial team were initially doubtful
that it would signiﬁcantly aﬀect power
output or eﬃciency. “Steve thought it
would work,” said Professor Durrant,
“but I didn’t believe it.”
To investigate the eﬀect, they
manufactured small solar cells
containing zinc oxide nanorods,
which are a piezoelectric material, and
measured their response to diﬀerent
levels and frequencies of sound. They
found that sound as low as 75dB, such
as conversation or roadside noise,
increased the eﬃciency of the cells,
and that the best response was to
sound at around 10kHz.
As music is usually played in
Professor Durrant’s lab, the team also
looked at the response of the cells to
diﬀerent kinds of music.
“It’s not very scientiﬁc,” he admits,
“as it’s hard to quantify the sound
as the amplitudes and frequencies
change.
Still, we found that the response to
Adele was better than to Beethoven or
traditional Persian music.
At ﬁrst we didn’t know why that was,
but then found that electronically-
synthesised music has more high-
frequency sounds than classical.”
Though common silicon cells do
not contain piezoelectric materials,
they can easily be manufactured into
newly-developed printed and polymer
solar cells.
Dr Steve Dunn said, “after
investigating systems for converting
vibrations into electricity, this is a
really exciting development that shows
a similar set of physical properties can
also enhance the performance of a
photovoltaic solar cell.”
Next, the researchers will be looking
to understand the mechanistic
reasons behind the eﬀect, and how it
scales with diﬀerent sound intensities.
