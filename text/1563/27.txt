t is diﬃcult to exaggerate
how important the band
Death is within extreme
metal circles. Whilst Pos-
sessed may have coined
the term ‘Death Metal’ with their
1984 demo of that name, it was Chuck
Schuldiner and the vehicle for his mu-
sical vision, the band; Death that laid
out the blueprint for the death metal
sound. Death’s debut album Scream
Bloody Gore has been described vari-
ously as “death metal’s ﬁrst archetypal
document” and “the ﬁrst true death
metal record”, whilst Chuck is wide-
ly regarded as the “Father of Death
Metal”. Whereas inﬂuencial groups
Celtic Frost and Venom had previ-
ously stumbled onto the territory that
would one day evolve into the myriad
forms of extreme music. In Chuck,
death metal had a pioneer who sought
out the blazing, savage, and lyrically
graphic music that abounded with

AMS album of the week
TOY are basically the voice
of British Krautrock, or at
least its closest descendent.
An online stream of their
second album, Join the
Dots, due to be released on
December 9th, went online
this Tuesday. Almost exactly
a year after their first album
“TOY” came out, once again
I am pleasantly surprised by
what I hear.
Opening with a throbbing
bassline and the typical TOY
synth, the leading single,
“Join the Dots” is an almost
8 minute piece that drives
itself forward and is well worth a listen.
The hectic touring schedule [including several successful festival
appearances this summer] and a well received single with Rose Elinor
Dougal have focused the band and the effect on this first snippet of music
compared to pieces from TOY is noticeable.
They are slowly carving out a distinctive sound, somewhere between My
Bloody Valentine and [to my immense pleasure] some of the earlier and
longer Pink Floyd compositions – Join the Dots and especially Conducter
sound as if they could burst into an extended “Set The Controls for the Heart
of the Sun” type soundscape everytime the lyrics stop. This slightly darker
and yet more experimental direction makes me glad since it would be very
easy for them to continue riding the Krautrock-revival image that’s been
pinned to them, and therefore not explore their unquestionable potential
with their new album.
There are some minor gripes with the overly repeated and simplistic lyrics,
but I think the whole presentation of the music makes it clear what frontman
Dan Carey and the boys are trying to get across – this album definitely gets
my seal of approval, as well as a retrospective recommendation to listen to
their first if you have any love for Krautrock, Floyd or slightly left-centre
pop rock.

Hey listen, my band
is gorier and darker
than anything else.
He stepped out on
a limb at a time
when that wasn’t
fashionable.” – Kelly

ist, Neurotica).
As one of the ﬁrst to embrace
the death metal genre and move-
ment Schuldiner became central to
the scene at its heart in Florida. After
playing guitar for only six months he
began recording at the age of 16, from
here his constant drive for musical de-
velopment, and search for increasing
levels of com-
plexity and
technicality
kept Death’s
line-up in
constant ﬂux.
The inﬂuence
of Death can
be seen sim-
ply by looking
through the
roster of its
ex-members.
Twenty-seven
m u s i c i a n s
were in the
band over its eighteen year career, with
Schuldiner as the only constant. This
reveals the auteur like role being played
by Chuck, in his attempts to drive the
genre he helped to create forward.
As well as its high levels of musi-
cianship death metal’s obsession with
graphic subject matter can also be
traced back to Death. A lot of songs
on Scream Bloody Gore were based
directly on horror movies. ‘Torn to
Pieces’ is about Make Them Die Slow-
ly, ‘Regurgitated Guts’ is about Gates
of Hell, ‘Scream Bloody Gore’ is about
Reanimator and ‘Evil Dead’ is about,
you guessed it, Evil Dead. But as one of
the ﬁrst adopters of the style Schuldin-
er can also be credited as one of the
ﬁrst to feel pigeonholed and try to
move away from what was becoming
the norm towards a more mature pro-
gressive feel on later records. He even
regretted his choice of band name,
which at 16 had seemed the height
of cool but at 30 just seemed silly.
Given all this the early loss of
Chuck to brain cancer in 2001, at
the age of only 34, was a heavy blow
to fans. Not only because of the
lost creative output that may have
been yet to come from such a pro-
liﬁc personality, but also because they
had lost an icon within the genre.
Twelve years later there is some
consolation for Death listeners as the
line-up from the record Human, with
the addition of Max Phelps on vocals
and guitar, present a sampling of works
from across all seven albums in a “cel-
ebration of Chucks Legacy”. Projec-
tions inside the Kentish town forum
show footage of interviews from the
man himself and those on stage are
keen to focus attention on his memory
rather than themselves. For those in
the crowd this is a rare and unlikely
opportunity to enjoy a live perfor-
mance of so many classic and beloved
tracks. It is hard to see Death return-
ing without the virtuoso frontman
at the helm, it wouldn’t be right. This
line-up touring under the name Death
To All, and giving proceeds to char-
ity, is as close as many of us are ever
going to get to the true Death experi-
ence. Romanos Skiadas said after the
show the he could now “die happy”
having seen the performance. This
is a sentiment likely shared by many
who never thought they would have
a chance to experience track like ‘Pull
the Plug’ and ‘Flattening Of Emotion’.
If you would like to listen to
some Death yourself I’m afraid I
can’t pull that oﬀ via newspaper, but
Rocksoc: The Aftermath will be do-
ing their own Death retrospective
on icradio.com so you can appreci-
ate Chuck’s genius there if you like.
Thomas Heaven recalls the band synonymous with death metal
James & the Rabbit Hole have
worked hard as a band since we last
heard from them and it’s deﬁnitely
paid oﬀ. The band was assembled fol-
lowing an application to the music
competition Uni Music League, and
new material was scribbled down
hurriedly as they powered through
the competition. Although the musi-
cal talent of each member was clear
from the start, the slight lack of depth
to the songs and their disjointed cor-
ners hinted at their speedy creation.
Now, however, it’s a diﬀerent story.
Their debut EP is due to be released
today and it sure packs a punch.
‘Quoth the Ravin’ sets the funk vibe
rolling. The guitar and bass riﬀs merit
comparison to Stevie Wonder tracks
and will have your foot tapping within
seconds. The next treat is the ﬁrst vo-
cal entry. New member of James & the
Rabbit Hole, Katie Addy, has a voice
that sounds as if it were designed for
such a punchy track. She maintains a
rich vocal tone throughout spiky ar-
ticulation and accentuation of lyrics
and decorates phrase ends with warm
vibrato. It becomes grittier as the song
builds. With many talented female
vocalists following the crowd toward
electronic music at the moment, it’s re-
freshing to hear such a voice in a Rock
‘n’ Roll band. The harmonies and gui-
tar ﬁllers in the chorus of ‘Quoth the
Ravin’ complete a great hook, whilst
the instrumental solos toward the
end of the song are equally exciting.
The vocals and guitar stabs are se-
ductive from the beginning of ‘Lions’.
But the highlight of this song is the
chorus, if one can call it that. Three
vocal sections, which sound a little like
a 90s pop song sung by a gospel choir,
are alternated with three instrumental
sections, which are more reminiscent
of a B.B. King melody. Against all
odds, it works. The ease with which
James & the Rabbit
Hole straddles mul-
tiple music genres
without overcompli-
cating songs is bril-
liant. The musicians
adapt to each style
seamlessly. This is
especially audible
from the guitar-
ists as well as the
drummer, Dan Day,
who builds a huge
number of com-

plex rhythms into the three track EP.
The ﬁnal track of the EP, ‘Edyta’, is
the most memorable track from when
I ﬁrst saw James & the Rabbit Hole live.
It’s slightly less cleverly constructed
than the other two songs on the EP.
However, the fast tempo, complicated
guitar riﬀs, harmonised choruses and
reams of lyrics ensure that everyone
will have a good time dancing to this.
James’ twangy voice and progres-
sion from singing into almost talking
at some points suits the song well.
James & the Rabbit Hole are
playing at the Workshop on the
14th of December to celebrate the
release of their EP. I highly recom-
mend purchasing a ticket (details can
be found on their Facebook page).
