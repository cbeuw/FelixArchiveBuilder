2.Roll Necks
Roll necks are back and they’re a simple win-
ter piece that can be dressed up or down. What’s
great is that they’re so easy to ﬁnd for a decent
price. Get one in a muted tone like nude or black
and dress it up with a statement piece of jewel-
lery.
3.Emerald Green
Emerald green is another one of the essential col-
ours of this season. It’s easy to wear in any way. Ac-
centing your everyday wardrobe with emerald ac-
cessories, like ballet ﬂats or even a belt, will have
you rocking the trend.
4. Knit Beanies
Knit beanies are practical and aﬀordable. An
essential piece for the frosty winter days, you’ll
deﬁnitely wear this everyday. Accessorise it with
a chunky knit scarf for bonus style points.
1.The Pink Coat
Boyfriend, trench or peacoat – a pink coat or
jacket is so feminine and chic. This season, pink is
the new black and every big brand from designer
to high street is dishing out their version of the
trend. If your budget is stretched, check out Zara
for a cute wool peacoat. If you have the money,
splurge on this beautiful version by Chloé.

Chloé, €1,495.00
Zara, £79.99

5. The Mini Bag
The mini-bag is a fall/winter essential-perfect
to take to all the festive season parties because it’s
so dainty and practical. Opt for one with a strap
if you don’t want to carry it all night long. For
an inexpensive but sleek looking version, look no
further than the oasis mini cross body bag.
