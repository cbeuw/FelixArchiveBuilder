his week Felix interviews
Adam Kay, the frontman
of Amateur Transplants
and an ex-Imperial Medical
student. If you’re not sure
who that is, look up the London
Underground song on YouTube and
send us a letter of thanks.
Q: Hi Adam, I think to start I have
to ask the obivous question, why
would anyone put themselves
through Imperial Medical School
for 6 years and then decide to sing
smutty songs for a living?
Well, I think you sort of decide what
you’re doing at University when you
choose your GCSEs, particularly for
medicine ‘cause you know you have to
kind of do sciences. I didn’t quite know
what I wanted to do when I was 16 and
the idea of being a doctor was a thing
people did, so I did it and I guess I knew
when I was studying that it wasn’t
100% suited to me but I ploughed on
because I was halfway there and then I
worked as a doctor for a bit but whilst
I was working as a doctor I was also
performing and doing various other
things so that when I eventually had
my full epiphany that I couldn’t do
that forever I was able to jump ship.
But you don’t want your hospitals
full of doctors who don’t particularly
give a shit about being a doctor, it’s
generally a good thing that that cohort
notice and try something else.
Q: How did you get through the app
process then, did you have to lie on
your personal statement?
No, I mean medicine’s a lot harder to
get into now than it was. The sort of
approach was they wanted someone
who had good predicted grades who
seemed just a nice chap; either did
music, or played rugby or did drama
or the school magazine, whatever it
was. I’d done music and things and
they decided I was the right sort
of ﬁt. But whilst I was at Imperial
something changed and it became
quite an academic medical school so
I deﬁnitely wouldn’t get in now. But
I think I was relatively honest on my
personal statement; certainly the facts
were there, whether I egged it up a bit
with how much I loved being a doctor.
I probably did, but it was probably
factually accurate.
Q: Are there any particular
memories you have of Imperial
College?
Umm, I don’t think there’s any sort of
individual stories. No there actually
are, I keep thinking of individual
stories but I literally can’t tell you
because the people involved are now
consultant physicians and surgeons
around the country and I’d hate for
their careers to end as a result of this
interview.
Q: Any non speciﬁc stories then?
I’m sure medical students haven’t
changed in the slightest, a lot of
drinking, nudity and the occasional
arrests.
Q: Did you see the Daily Mail article
about the Reynolds? How does that
compare?
It’s not a very pleasant environment,
if you’re a rugby playing drinking boy
it’s very fun to do all these drinking
games, but if you’re not that, if you
don’t ﬁt into that mould it’s a very
scary environment – there’s a lot of
pressure on to drink and I think in
all honesty it wouldn’t do any harm
for everyone to take a bit of a look
at themselves and think “am I happy
that this is happening in a university?”,
particularly people who have to
have some degree of probity who
are training to be doctors. I’m sure
at Imperial it was all painted as “oh
they’re being such killjoys and this is
just tradition and fun”. But you know
I wasn’t one of the rugby guys and
I often did think I was being forced
into drinking more than I would.
Otherwise I was going to be picked
on as an outsider. I think there’s the
diversity for fun and the diversity
for drinking without that. It can be a
horrid environment so I don’t think
there’s any harm in someone noticing.
Q: How would you advertise
yourself to Imperial students who
know of you only from the London
Underground song?
I ruin all their favourite songs. I
haven’t quite shaken my science roots
so there’s probably no nerdier smutty
piano based comedian. I’m playing
a Christmas show that is literally
the opposite of any other West End
pantomime sort of thing; it’s just sort
of horrendous, swearing, blasphemy,
with vague scientiﬁc undertones.
Q: Have you ever had a song that’s
too oﬀensive or is it anything goes?
No I have to self-censor but you self-
censor for a number of reasons, you
write something and take a step back
and think “is it funny? Is it clever? Is it
oﬀensive?” And oﬀensive is something
I have to think about a lot because if
you go and see a comedian the idea
is that you leave happier than when
you went because if you don’t then
you’ve absolutely failed as a comedian,
so a lot of what I do is near to the
knuckle but I try quite hard to make
sure people aren’t going to be actually
upset by what happens. Hopefully I
achieve it because they don’t seem to
walk out or call the police or write
articles however stressful it was.
Q: What do you see in a news story
that makes you want to sing about
it?
Probably half the time it comes from
a topic I want to explore and half the
time it comes from a song I’ve heard
on the radio and I’ve realised I can
change one of the words to bum and
stretch that out to three minutes. I
think what I do is quite broad; I don’t
stick to one particular topic. I think
if I have a song people would like to
hear I write it. I think there’s also a big
attrition rate, probably a quarter of the
songs I write ever hear the light of day
on stage. Though when I’m playing in
a week or so the theme is very much
Christmas, then again it is nearly
Christmas.
Q: So do you have a favourite song in
particular to perform? Or one that
gets the best audience reaction?
I don’t know, I mean often it’s one of
the more recent songs I’ve written. I
enjoy playing those just because the
London Underground song I must
have played 300 billion times.
Nearly as much as it’s been seen on
YouTube.
Yeah, I am grateful for that song, but
if I was told I never had to play it
again I wouldn’t say no. But I mostly
enjoy songs which are fairly new
to me because I’m still hearing the
punchlines for the third or fourth
time. I wrote a version of the John
Lewis ad and played that at a gig a
few days ago and that was enjoyable
because it was so new to me.
Q: Have you ever thought about
writing a song about Imperial in
particular?
No, I mean you’ve got to look at how
big an audience is. If I have a speciﬁc
gig at the association of whateverers
I will write often some material for
that occasion, but the occasion hasn’t
arisen for me to perform at Imperial.
Q: So we have to book you to get our
own song?
Exactly, you have to fucking pay me!
I’m not a charity! I’m not sure what
I would say about it, but I think that
overall it was an enjoyable experience.
Q: Did you ever read Felix when
you were here? And what were your
thoughts?
I did, the Editor was called Will
Dugdale and it was very good actually,
it was a useful resource and it had
really good cryptic crosswords. I
don’t know if you still have them, but
it taught me how to do them which I
started doing in my ﬁrst year and I still
do every day.
That’s useful life skills being taught
at Imperial
Probably the thing at Imperial that’s
had the most impact on my life, but
certainly not anything in the degree I
did, just learning how to complete the
cryptic crossword.
Q: Do you have an opinion on the
new 24 hour tube hours and lack of
ticket oﬃcers, is there going to be a
revision to the song?
There will deﬁnitely be a revision to
the song. It’s never nice when people
lose their jobs but on the other hand
I’m yet to see a smile from a London
Underground worker so I can’t be so
sad that they’re all going to be replaced
with robots. Inevitably there will be
strikes so my song will get a bit more
airplay. But my overall feeling about
the 24 hour opening is at the moment
half the tubes are closed during the
day at the weekend, so can we sort out
the days ﬁrst and then move on to the
night? They seem to be running before
they can walk. I live on the District
Line, I can’t use it any weekend. So
it’s all well and good telling me I can
use it at night, but I think we all know
full well that’s not true. Also can you
imagine the stench? A river of vomit
running through the centre of the
night tube? It’ll be worse than the
buses, and if it’s running 24 hours how
do you clean it? Or will there be this
constant smell of sick 24 hours a day?
Q: Finally, what would you say to
anyone at Imperial thinking maybe
they want to go into something a bit
more creative?
Finish your degree, you’ve always got
the option to go back and do it later.
It’s always good to have a vocation,
but on the other hand it’s a fucking
awful job. Why anyone would go back
I don’t know. It’s such a long degree
– everyone thinks about quitting at
some point. But I’m pleased that I
stuck it out because if for any instance
variety and gigging dries up at some
point I can always grit my teeth and
work as a locum again or something.
The Amateur Transplants Christmas
Show hits London on Friday the 13th of
December at the Bloomsbury Theatre,
with student tickets costing £16. Check
it out for the funniest, sweariest night
you can get to on the tube.
