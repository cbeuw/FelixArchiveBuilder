FRIDAY 06 DEC
MUSIC
Sandy Nimmo sees The Hoosiers at the O2 Academy
o you remem-
ber the UK
“odd-pop” trio
The Hoosiers?
I wouldn’t
blame you if
you didn’t – when I told fel-
low students I was going to
see them at the O2 Acad-
emy, the response was a
collective “Oh, are they still
going?” (apart from one ob-
sessive Popjustice reader).
Riding the 2003-2008 wave
of guitar-based pop being
chart mainstays and the ra-
dio norm, their 2007 first
album The Trick To Life
went double platinum in the
UK and spawned two infectiously-
catchy top-5 singles ‘Worried About
Ray’ and ‘Goodbye Mr A. Slots’ on
popular TV shows ensued, alongside
an extensive tour and stints on the
festival circuit . Despite their popu-
larity, criticism of their cheesiness
abounded from the more snooty
indie types due to their per-
ceived omni-cheery demeanour
and 70s ELO-influenced sound;
they won NME’s Worst Band
award in 2008. This, and their
“aren’t we quirky?” penchant for
dressing up in superhero out-
fits at gigs, still couldn’t damp-
en overall public enthusiasm
Their 2010 second album
The Illusion of Safety, despite
improved media reviews, did
not boast such impressive sales
figures. After the dancier Hot-Chip
stylings of lead single ‘Choices’ was
well-received on radio yet failed to
make the top 10, Sony cut their losses
and pulled further promotion, leav-
ing the band out in the wilderness,
a fate similarly bestowed on their
mid-2000s contemporaries The Fr-
atellis and Kaiser Chiefs (but not,
bizarrely, Scouting For Girls – a
more punchable name and sound
could surely not be found). Back
on their own (partially fan-funded)
label, they’ve been busy readying
another album slated for release in
March 2014, and came to London as
part of a low-key tour to test their
new material. The superhero out-
fits are gone. They mean business.
They opened with their lat-
est single ‘Somewhere in the Dis-
tance’, currently available on Spo-
tify and as a free download if the
album is pre-ordered. This nod-
ded to indie-bands-du-jour with
synth sounds reminiscent of Eve-
rything Everything and a Foals-
like spacey pre-chorus and choppy
guitars, while vocal melodies and
the powerful chorus sounded reas-
suringly Hoosier-ish. Other new
cuts sounded equally promising,
D
such as the bouncy ‘Fidget Brain’
or the crowd-pleasing lyricism of
‘Handsome Girls’ and ‘Pretty Boys’.
While lead singer Irwin Sparkes
was in fine voice throughout, in full
control of his impressive falsetto
register, and Alan Sharland banging
the drums with goofy enthusiasm,
the quality of their live sound
was mixed at times. First album
song ‘Everything Goes Dark’ was
particularly impressive, build-
ing to a swelling, emotional cre-
scendo that far outweighed the
album version, but songs like
‘Worst Case Scenario’ sounded
lightweight and insubstan-
tial, lacking the “oomph” pro-
vided by the studio recordings.
As someone more used to
Glasgow audiences that jump
around constantly chanting riffs
and basslines when there’s no sing-
ing, the smartphone-toting London
audience appeared a bit sterile, but
the band got everyone into the spirit
of things masterfully with good song
choices and excellent between-song
banter, part self-deprecating, part
faux-pomposity. Swedish ex-fire-
man and bassist Martin Skarendahl
played the straight-man through-
out, alongside long-standing live
multi-instrumentalist Sam Swallow
who recently became an official
fourth member. With the gig end-
ing on the massive high of ‘Good-
bye Mr A’, given a full rocky outro,
everyone left with a great big grin
on their face. While yours truly was
a big fan of the second album and
so would’ve preferred more songs
like ‘Bumpy’ Ride or the Muse-isms
of ‘Glorious’, it’s no doubt that the
Hoosiers offer a great night out and
some cracking songs - even if they
are unlikely to ever again reach the
giddy heights of their commercial
peak. Beats Guns ‘n Roses anyway.
The Hoosiers’ fourth album, The
News From Nowhere, is set to be
released some time next year.
The Who?-siers Emielʼs Guide to
Onwards we march! Well, not
quite marching, as the first notated
rhythms tended to be divisible by
three. During the 13th Century, a
new class of literates emerged as a
result of the university at Paris, and,
combined with the now well-estab-
lished body of written works, music
became an intellectual pursuit, theo-
rised and written about – but more
importantly, the first complete sys-
tem of writing music came together.
Notation could now convey almost
everything necessary for perfor-
mance, allowing literate music to set
off on its independent course.
The foundations for this were laid
in the 12th Century Ars Antiqua,
which we discussed at length in the
previous instalment. Aside from the
already-mentioned developments in
polyphony, perhaps the most impor-
tant contribution of the old school at
Notre Dame was the clear division
of music through time. Music had
become metrical; notes were quite
simply held for different lengths
relative to each other and alternated
to give what is called a rhythmic
mode (for example, long-short-long-
short-long, where a long has twice
the duration of a short). However,
these rhythmic modes were derived
from ‘quantitative’ poetic meter and
didn’t require a new notation of any
kind; the mode could simply be given
and applied to a whole composition.
It wasn’t until now, the 13th Century
that a method was devised to assign
duration to each written note indi-
vidually.
The music of Paris at this time was
secular, urban and playful. Compos-
ers became renowned for their ‘vir-
tuosic’ composition, often pulling
together melodies from many differ-
ent sources and arranging them into
a single piece. Polyphony became
more complex, with different voices
using different rhythms. Often the
higher voices moved at a faster pace
than the lower and so modal rhythm
had in effect already become redun-
dant. Once again visit the Felix web-
site and have a listen to composers
such as Adam de la Halle.
One hundred years later, in the
14th Century, a style developed call
the ‘Ars Nova’ – still centred on the
university at Paris. This movement
has been compared in magnitude to
the introduction of perspective in
painting and marks the beginning
of the Renaissance in music. Para-
doxically, many Ars Nova compos-
ers were also mathematicians, and
applied their knowledge to explore
new rhythms and combinations of
rhythms to achieve an unprecedent-
ed freedom of expression.
The prototypal music here is the
collection of motets known as the
Roman de Fauvel, which set various
satirical poems to music. However,
arguably the greatest musician was
Guillaume de Machaut (d. 1377).
Not only was his ‘stacking’ of voices
incredibly intricate and sensuous
but his harmonic language was to
be emulated for the following two
centuries. Previously, a historical im-
perfection in the notation of scales
or ‘modes’ had made it necessary to
sing notes outside of the system in
order to properly harmonise certain
intervals. We now call these notes
sharps or flats which lie between the
notes of the scale. For example, C#:
a pitch slightly higher than C, but
still lower than D. Machaut made
free use of these for the first time
and wrote them into his music. The
result is dissonance for the sake of
dissonance and a powerful sense of
resolution– a potent expressive tool.
Music could now ache and throb
much like the heart does.
Machaut spent the majority of his
life in the service of various aristo-
crats and kings. At the time, he was
best known as a poet and writer of
love-songs and courtly ballads, yet
today he is remembered mostly for
his setting of the mass – the first
to be attributed entirely to a single
composer, functioning as a coher-
ent whole. Luckily for us, in his later
years he became preoccupied with
the preservation of his manuscripts
for posterity.
As we have seen, the development
of musical thought and language has
been inextricably linked to the devel-
opment of a means to notate it. We
have already covered some 5 centu-
ries, but only now is literate music
fully diverging from oral traditions
and coming in to its own. Next week
we will enter the renaissance; a pe-
riod of massive change and develop-
ment and the birth of modern music.
