Mamilian Eggl, totally needs a Roomba to clean up after him #yoloswag
Considering how much of an apple
fan I am, I think this is a bit of
an obvious one. At the moment I
have an iPhone 5, and I don’t see
the 5S as enough of an upgrade to
pay out that much money. I mean
sure the 64-bit processor and the
fingerprint scanner are all really
nice, but do I want to pay upward
of £500 for it? I’d rather wait for the
6, and get some real improvement
for my money. However if the
dough was not an issue, I could
easily imagine myself going for the
new iPhone. Now, which colour?
Should I go for the blingy gold?
Sometimes I get really tired of
chargers, with all the wires and plugs.
Furthermore with our modern day
smartphones, you need to charge
your telephone everyday and/or bring
chargers with you if you are a power
use and want your phone to last the
entire day. Therefore if I had unlimited
cash, I would totally go for one of those
charger mats. Basically you throw a case
around your phone, plug in the mat, lay
your phone on the mat and voila it will
charge. This just seems the ultimate
convenience for me, as it doesn’t look
half bad and the concept is just so cool,
how could I not consider it?
A hoodie with built in earphones, that
even exists, I hear you say? Yes, and it
has been my dream to wear one of these
for a long time now. Perfectly machine
washable, I consider these jumpers the
heigh of human invention. Imagine
how stealthy you just plug one of those
cords into your ear and listen to music.
No one would suspect anything! Ok yes
you would a bit weird, but well what the
heck. However at £60-80, the price tag is
a bit too much for what I get considering
that I can only use these earphones for 3
(maybe 4) days max before they have to
be washed, which means that 3 days out
of the week I have no earphones.
Right now I have a 30Mb connection
for my home, which considering my
needs is more than enough. However
once I starting streaming 1440p
youtube videos, downloading games
on steam and trying to browse the
internet on my iPad, sometime I do
see that it gets a bit slow. However
if I had too much money, I would
totally go for the maximum, in fact
I would probably would go for the
business deals, which give you an
insane amount of speed (which
can go up to one 1Tb). With this I
would never have to worry about
downloading a movie on iTunes!
As a student I am kinda lazy. Yes its
true once in a while I don’t vacuum
my room, and to be really honest
am do not feel very guilty about
it. However if I had a Roomba, the
handy cleaning robot, I would never
have to worry about vacuuming.
However at £200-300 for the best
model, it is quite outside my rather
meagre means. Yet every day I
imagine, how great it would be to
just kick back and see that little
robot whizzing around. Now all I
need is a robot that does my laundry
as well, hmm....
If you’ve ever thought that HD
pictures were not enough, fear
no more, the Samsung OLED TV
that uses organic self-emitting
pixels would blow your mind away
this Christmas giving you the
best quality, surpassing even the
best LCD TVs. This TV doesn’t
come cheap, expect to be paying
an average price of nine grand,
however if you consider the price
per pixel it almost makes it worth
it!
This little beauty beats your
average shed, that’s for sure, if you
fancy chilling in your garden this
Christmas but want to keep warm
in this cosy pod with its inbuilt
fiberglass insulation you wont be
disappointed. True, this is not
exactly what I would call a ‘piece of
tech’ but imagine setting up your
gaming rig in here and playing
Battlefield 4 on a winter’s night.
The cozy atmosphere would just
completely add to your skill
Yes…this luxury truck/hippie van
is more expensive than my home
and your home put together.
The Marchi Mobile vehicle
has everything you need this
Christmas all in one, with a master
bedroom, fireplace, 40 inch TV
and a huge living room to name
a few. You could probably have
your Christmas tree and presents
and even throw your after party in
this beast. This is pretty much the
definition of travelling in style!

Osama Awara, going for the extravagantly amazing tech
The TRON bike is one of those vehicles
you’ll see on the street and ponder upon
its street legality. This bike sure does
look impressive despite not having the
loud throaty roar of a Harley Davidson,
due to its whisper quite technology. If
you don’t like the sound of your internal
combustion engine, this is probably
the smoothest ride you can have this
Christmas, especially with the TRON
replicalightilluminationstogiveyouthat
night glow and make you look like you’ve
literally shot out of the movie screens.
We all know how Bruce Wayne
dines in style from his Stately
Wayne Manor, but where does he
watch movies? In his bat-cave of
course, and now theatre designer
Elite Home Theatre seating is
offering the chance to share the
same experience for a staggering
$2 million but would sure be worth
it if you have the spare cash this
Christmas especially when it t’is
the season… where the best movies
come out on TV.
