Ramblings on Personal Legend
P
aul Coelho’s best-selling
novel, The Alchemist,
reminds us to be true
to ourselves and to seek
out our ‘personal legend’.
A king advises Santiago, the chief
protagonist, that, “when you really
want something to happen, the
whole universe conspires so that your
wish comes true.”. This in itself is an
uplifting prospect. In spite of this
the various realities and suﬀerings
happening around the world on a daily
basis demonstrate that this is, all too
often, far from the truth. A line that
I read in Albert Camus’ The Plague
emboldened this for me. “To the day
I die I shall refuse to love this creation
in which children are tortured.” The
so-called ‘lost generation’ of Syrian
children serves as a case in point. How
can an individual best serve humanity
in the modern age while staying true
to oneself?
One might argue that the 21st cen-
tury is one of pragmatism, that with a
growing population and consumption
of both our land and resources, ad-
ministering to ‘the self’ is fundamen-
tally unjust. The concept of pilgrimage
serves as a suitable allegory. People
have travelled for centuries, yearning
to absorb and utilise as much of our
natural world as possible by search-
ing for inner unity and insight. The
modern irony is that, when travelling,
we actively tarnish the world around
us (through travel on planes, trains
etc.). Even the pursuit of knowledge
via modern channels impinges on the
planet (laptops, tablets etc. require
both plastic and rare earth metals).
This might be perceived to be a
negative take on things. The pursuit of
knowledge has yielded dividends for
humanity as a whole. Particle physics
demonstrates that, as we continue to
strip layers from the fabric of the uni-
verse, there will always be more sur-
prises awaiting us. Modern medicine
has extended our life span. Freedom
of information undermines inequality.
These revelations share the common
thread of our humanity in an imper-
fect world. To my mind Coelho hit the
nail on the head in a 2005 New York
Times interview, “I believe enlighten-
ment or revelation comes in daily life.
I look for joy, the peace of action. You
need action.”
In brief, it could be argued that, in
searching for our personal legend
in the 21st century, we aﬀect (for
better or worse) humanity’s collective
legend. We cannot turn back. Our
sphere of existence is what it is. Each
one of us will do as we always have and
administer to ourselves. Who knows?
The world may change for the better
by doing so.

Berlusconi was
expelled from the
Senate of the Italian Republic; he no
longer represents anyone but himself.
He cannot abuse his parliamentary
seat anymore to avoid his legal
troubles. He cannot run for oﬃce
and may even be tried for his various
crimes.
In a way, if you’ll forgive me a cliché,
it’s the end of an era. Berlusconi has
warped and corrupted Italian politics
by neglecting the country to solve
his personal issues. He has created a
barbarouscultureofillegality.Theright
has become a joke (divided between
xenophobes and his spineless serfs).
The left has either been entrenched
in its own pseudo-intellectualism or
too complacent to ﬁght him properly.
Furthermore, another party has risen
as the direct expression of Berlusconi’s
message of base populism, appeal to
the masses and divinely inspired self-
righteousness.
With his political demise, however,
we can, perhaps, hope to move on.
Maybe we’ll get a political party wor-
thy of deﬁnition instead of the bands
of conniving speculators that mostly
sit in parliament. Maybe we can start
discussing the economy, investment
in education and research and the role
of Europe without having to hold long
discussions regarding Berlusconi’s tri-
als. Maybe we can extirpate the men-
tality of illegality that he has protected
and fostered. I, for one, am not going
to hold my breath.
I’ve been awaiting this moment
for many years, and I don’t mean my
adult life. As a child I remember being
lectured on how Berlusconi was a
crook and a cheater. Luckily, at that
time, his crimes ‘merely’ consisted
of tax evasion, fraud, Maﬁa deals
and conspiracy against the state, so
I was spared from having to learn
about prostitution rings. Despite this,
Berlusconi has always been the central
player of Italian politics as long as I’ve
been able to rudimentarily understand
it (if anyone can claim to). You might
infer that the end of his reign should
be a signiﬁcant event.
Despite the momentousness of
what has happened I cannot cheer.
Berlusconi has made the country
poorer, both in wealth and spirit. The
eﬀects of these twenty years will long
outlast him. Apart from running the
economy into the ground and making
many useless or deleterious reforms,
he has made my country the subject
of jokes and ridicule. He has forced
me, along with thousands of my
compatriots, to leave Italy, in order
to ﬁnd proper studying opportunities
(let alone work). He has prolonged the
culture of chauvinism, homophobia
and intolerance that other, better
nations have already begun to cast
oﬀ. Only Mussolini has done a worse

job at running Italy and he had to ally
with the Nazis to accomplish that.
This is not something that can be
solved overnight. People vote for
him in droves because he has an iron
grip on the minds of many. He has
inculcated a mentality of nepotism
and corruption in Italy that has taken
root to unprecedented levels. There
have been corrupt people in Italy
before (including corrupt people in
charge) but none of them have been
so successful at it. None have been
so unrepentant, so blatant, in their
disregard for the common good.
There are millions who believe his
falsehoods and it will take nothing
short of an entire generational change
to ﬁnally rid us of his shameful legacy.
If this comes across as bitter and
hopeless it’s because I am, profoundly
so. The mere fact that we have to
celebrate when a senator is expelled
from Parliament on fraud charges
testiﬁes to how anomalous the Italian
situation has become. I will keep
on following the political scene and
voting. I will do all else that I can do
from here. Perhaps I’ll return one
day, better equipped to help than I
am now. Italy will otherwise remain
a disappointment for me, a country
of great culture, of immense value
and potential, a nation that could and
should help Europe and the world.
Alas, it is shackled by ineﬀective and
corrupt leaders. When I see the latest
news on the weather, wreaking havoc
thanks to corrupt administrators,
mothers forcing their underage
daughters into prostitution or the
widespread and barbarous exhibitions
of racist mentality or a magnate that
lies his way to freedom (and dupes
millions while those who should ﬁght
him are too spineless, litigious or
outright accomplices to do so). I am
reminded of my favourite deﬁnition of
Italy; a heaven inhabited by demons.
