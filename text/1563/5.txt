E
very year the RCSU issues the Science
Challenge, which has evolved into
an essay competition with very
acceptable prizes. However the original
motivation for the challenge was only
known to a select few ‚Äì now it can be revealed.
Some years ago a curious old RCS alumnus
found he had insuÔ¨Écient life expectancy
to exploit the ideas and inventions he had
accumulated over the years. He decided to Ô¨Ånd
a group of IC students to explore these ideas by
issuing a challenge with a cash prize with the
assistance of the RCSU, which had just been
reformed. That original question proved too
diÔ¨Écult and was shelved. However it is still on
the table and even though the prize was claimed,
a. signiÔ¨Åcant number of ideas remain to be
shared with anyone willing to try.
This was that challenge :-
In order to encourage the reformed RCSU and
to forge ties with the RCSA, it was suggested
that there should be a competition based on the
following proposal.
--ooOOoo--
RCS Association Competition
During the foreseeable future an event will
occur which will either kill most of humanity or
make the planet‚Äôs surface uninhabitable. Once
that happens it will be too late to take any useful
action, consequently it would seem prudent to get
ready now, while we are still alive.
The information needed to give our descendants
a Ô¨Çying start on the way to a new civilisation will
need to be in a long-lasting form and a format
that will make sense to whoever is left of whatever
ethnicity and language.
We are asking you to propose a terminal
disaster, be it asteroid impact, super volcano or
total global warming, and then propose a way to
preserve the most suitable group of people and
a method of supplying them with survival data,
which you will deÔ¨Åne, in an indestructible way.
Clearly I and a few members of the RCSA,
would like to be included but this may not be
acceptable to everyone else. Our chances of living
for 100 or more years to see some new habitat are
really doubtful.
So who would be there and where would it
be ‚Äì on the surface ‚Äì below ground ‚Äì above the
atmosphere? But please, not in space! This planet
is home for some time to come.
What language would the information be
in? How will it be presented and where are we
to put it? All these questions and more present
themselves.
If you‚Äôre clever enough to be here how will you
survive?
A small prize is oÔ¨Äered to the group that
provides the most practical solution and an even
smaller prize for the most amusing answer.
What would be left ‚Äì and has someone done
this before? If so, where is it?
--ooOOoo‚Äî
In the event the students opted for a far more
immediate and practical challenge and decided
to throw it open to the whole college. This
became the Imperial College Science Challenge
and on 20/2/06 appeared in Broadsheet as :-
How will science allow a long-term, self-
contained settlement on Mars to become a
reality?
In order to attract as much interest as possible
there were signiÔ¨Åcant prizes oÔ¨Äered and free
drinks at the prize giving ceremony. It worked
well with many competitors from across the
College taking part. Five of the best entries were
chosen for the judges to evaluate and the turnout
for the Ô¨Ånal presentations in the Sir Alexander
Fleming lecture theatre was impressive.
Science Challenge‚Äôs Original Aim Exposed

T
he Holland Club was so
popular because it was a
unique facility within the
CollegeoÔ¨Äeringatraditional
‚Äòlocal‚Äô pub ambience for
staÔ¨Ä and postgraduates to relax and
socialise in. The bar was carpeted and
comfortably furnished, the lighting
sympathetic, the atmosphere warm
and friendly.
The new bar in no way ‚Äúpreserves
the ethos of the Holland Club‚Äù, the
original assurance made to staÔ¨Ä and
postgraduates by the college. Instead
we have been provided with a prime
example of corporate catering.
The h-bar is now identical to other
college outlets and is little diÔ¨Äerent
to either the Students‚Äô Union or
Eastside: it has been likened by some
to a motorway services; add some
screaming kids and you could be in a
McDonald‚Äôs. We struggle to think of a
less welcoming place to enjoy a drink
in the entire district. The idea that it is
a ‚Äòpub‚Äô is contemptible.
The worst thing about the whole
exercise is that it was totally
preventable. The Holland Club
Committee could have maintained a
separate bar whilst making additional
space for student meetings, meeting
space being a primary reason given for
making the changes.
The takeover was from the outset
conducted in an underhand manner.
Rumours and secretive visits to the
Holland Club by senior management
who were apparently ‚Äòcasing the joint‚Äô
preceded any approach to the Holland
Club Committee. A sudden need
to serve evening meals in the MDH
was contrived so that it could then
be deemed unsatisfactory for that
purpose. StaÔ¨Ä representatives and the
Bar Manager, Kevin Young, spent a
lot of time trying to reach a mutually
agreeable solution, but the college had
already decided on the outcome and
the plans. There was the usual sham
consultation, something the college
specialises in: not one of the several
hundred comments were taken on
board.
The Holland Club was established in
1948 by a benevolent and far-sighted
College Rector who realised that
staÔ¨Ä needed their own haven from
the demands of work; a haven that
became increasingly important as
changes within the College developed
an increasingly more pressurised
working environment. Over time
the social facility was extended to
postgraduate students and in recent
years the Holland Club has fostered
new friendships and networking,
facilitated informal and sometimes
very productive discussions about
research work, and above all provided
somewhere welcoming to relax and
wind down after work.
Former Holland Club users will no
doubt be divided between those able
to accept the change and those who
cannot, and those unable to adapt will
no doubt be dismissed as whining.
However it must be said that many
users of the old club decline to use
the new facility not out of rancour
but because it is just so unpleasant.
Commercial services claim much
positive feedback though strangely the
h-bar remains unlisted on their review
page: a case of Emperors‚Äô Clothes?
New staÔ¨Ä and students will only
know of the h-bar but, as with
Southside, the name and reputation
of the Holland Club will linger on for
some time yet.
Sadly , the h-bar will above all
remain a monument to the college‚Äôs
contempt for its staÔ¨Ä.
