FRIDAY 06 DEC
GAMES
Endless dosh, what would you want?
Maximilian Eggl knows Santaʼs checking his list, doing it twice!
I have been playing shooter games
forever, from Star Wars Battlefront
2 and Halo all the way to Counter-
strike and Call of duty. The battleﬁeld
series has always interested me, and
I almost splashed out for Battleﬁeld
3. However I either never seemed to
have the money or time and therefore
my time to play this seemingly
awesome game had passed. Yet with
the release of Battleﬁeld 4, the next
instalment in this series, major steps
forward seem to have been taken
and an improvement of an already
good game. With levolution, updated
graphics and generally sick maps, this
looks like a shooter I would really
enjoy, but at a combined value of £80,
this bundle is quite an investment. If
I had enough money, this would be
ﬁrst thing I would buy, on the other
hand you never know might actually
just get this game if I save up enough!
If I had more money than sense,
this would be the gaming laptop I
would go for. Alienware is known
to be one of the best manufacturers
of gaming laptops (if a bit on the
pricey side), and use some of the
best ingredients for their products.
Costing about £4,000, the Alienware
18 includes a full 1080p 18’’ screen,
2 Nvidia GTX 780M (one of the
best GPU’s on the market at the
moment, 32GB of RAM, the list
just goes on. Everything that is
considered the best on the market.
Every game you could think of, this
game could run it very comfortable
on the ultra graphics settings and
not drop below 60 frames per
second. Using the Alienware 18
would make playing any game an
absolutely great experience. Also,
that lighting doesn’t look half bad,
now does it!
I myself am quite an avid strategy
gamer. Being the first genre of
games I really played intensively,
I have gone through all kinds of
variations on the tried and tested
approach. Therefore this game,
which has been on my steam wish
list for quite a long time, seems
like exactly the kind of game I
would enjoy. However for 40 (at
some points actually 80) pounds,
I find this would be a bit much
to spend on an unknown quantity
regardless of its apparent epicness.
Furthermore at the moment it is in
Beta, meaning it could be buggy.
The risk is just too high that I’m
throwing a significant amount
of money down the drain for me
to really warrant purchasing it.
However if money was not an issue,
this would be one of the games I
would totally go for.
Audio is a very important aspect of
gaming. In fact the quality of your
headset can be the deciding factor
between you hearing your opponents
footsteps and killing him, or him
sneaking up on you and knifing you!
This is indeed true for shooters and
other online games, however even
for other single-players games, the
atmosphere that excellent quality
music and sound is paramount to
a great gaming experience. For my
choice of Headset I go for the A50s,
which are 300 pounds a pop, but
make up for the price impressively.
Dolby 7.1 surround sound and
wireless just make these puppies
a joy to use, and should make any
audiophile drool. Also they not just
limited gaming, and make great
general use headphones. So if I was
crapping gold, this is one of the first
things i would buy!
If I had an absolutely enormous
amount of money, and really
couldn’t care less, I would buy about
a thousand CS:GO keys. A quick
explanation of what they are: if
you play a round on CounterStrike
there is a random chance that you
are assigned a box of loot, which
you can only open if you buy a key.
Within these boxes they have some
absolutely epic decals and skins for
some of your most common guns.
They do not add anything to the
game play, except for the visuals of
your gun change, which if you are
dominating make you feel that extra
bit more like a badass. However at
1.50 a pop, which relatively low
chance of actually getting what you
want, the risk versus reward is way
to high. Yet if I really couldn’t care
less, I would just buy a boatload of
these things
As a massive fan of Super Mario 3D
land for the 3DS and of all other
3D Mario games I have been super
excited about Super Mario 3D world.
A game which combines all the fun
of 3D Mario but in stunning HD
and, for the first time, multiplayer.
Super Mario 3D world for the Wii
U lets you play up to 4 people
multiplayer with Mario, Luigi,
Toad, and Princess Peach (and her
umbrella) as playable characters. I
for one am super excited to play as
Princess Peach. A great Present for
any holiday season.
I missed this title when it came out
earlier this year and Christmas is
a good time to pick it up. Offering
the same fun as Pikmin 1 and 2
all those years ago but in HD and
with the added functionality of
the Wii U gamepad this is a game
to get excited about! Whether you
have played the previous games in
the series or not I think this game
has a lot to offer and I hope that
it delivers. It will be interesting to
see how my experiences of Captain
Olimar and his Pikmin differs now
that I am older.
The combat system in the earlier
games has ensured that this game
has a special place in my heart.
After honing my skills in Batman
Arkham Asylum and perfecting my
style in Arkham City I am definitely
ready for the next title in this
series. More story, more challenges,
more Batman lore. This is a great
success in super hero games. I love
Batman , DC comics and these
games are awesome! Taking all
in consideration I may even buy
this game regardless of how much
money I have!
I am hoping that this game is like
the 4th Pirates of the Caribbean
movie and so it will make me
excited about this franchise again.
After loving the first game and
then experiencing the magic that
is Assassins Creed 2 I felt let down
by the rest of the series. I wish that
this game brings the series back to
the excitement I had when playing
2. I want more days spent jumping
over rooftops and finding hidden
feathers. I’ll have to wait and see
if this game offers more than just
Pirates.
If I were to get another console this
is what I’d go with. After missing
out on the Playstation 3 maybe it’s
time to get back in on their list of
exclusives. The store should be
offering the PS3 games I missed
out on plus indie games and other
goodies. Playstation Plus is also
the next best thing to free online
multiplayer. In addition to my Wii U
and computer the PS4 would open
up some interesting new gaming
options. It would also function as
a great media center with Twitch,
Netflix and a blu-ray player.
