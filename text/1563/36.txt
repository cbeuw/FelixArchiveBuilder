FRIDAY 06 DEC
GAMES
I
remember the turbulent release
period of Pokemon Gold & Silver
back in 2001. As a gallant eight
year old boy I had anticipated its
arrival in April. Unfortunately
the date of release coincided with the
outbreak of ‘Foot-&-Mouth’ disease.
As an Irishman, ensnared by water
on all sides, the ensuing aerial trade
embargo dashed and deﬂated my
hopes. My anticipation incrementally
ratcheted to breaking point between
April and October. In that interval,
deprived of the game, I envisaged it
in all its glory in the classroom, in the
playground, at the dinner table. When
Gold ﬁnally arrived, it was every bit as
satiating as I had hoped. The Legend of
Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is the
ﬁrst game in twelve years to emulate
those infantile impulses of nostalgia.
My own copy is lying in wait under the
Christmas tree back home in Ireland...
Roll on December 14th!
IGN eloquently summed up the
essence of the latest addition to the
series.
“ Not only does it pay homage to
Linking Ages Past and Present
Zelda’s past glory: It reinvigorates its
spark.”
Trailers and reviews not only led
me to relate to the a priori form of
previous Zelda games but subtly
hinted at a new and unprecedented
dynamism. Its crux is said to lie in
a multi-tiered, challenging puzzle
platform, bolstered by colour coding
and a retro Gameboyesque top-down
2D view. As a massive supporter
of Nintendo, I am glad to see them
develop yet another memorable
game that simultaneously exhibits
traditional traits and innovation.
If you are a true Zelda veteran
you will immediately draw parallels
between A Link Between Worlds and
A Link to the Past, released on the
SNES back in the 1990s. The Hyrule
map shows many similarities with that
of its predecessor. These blueprints
are touched up by the impressive
graphics on the 3DS platform. Other
characteristics of the game also stand
out. Many items can be “rented” at
a given location, ensuring that the
player is well-equipped for the tasks
at hand. This saves time searching
around in dungeons and caves for
treasure chests.
The puzzles have been awarded an
increased level of intricacy. Some
argue that A Link Between Worlds is
the “best puzzle game that Nintendo
has ever released”. From trailers and
teasers it looks like they’ve drawn
from Pøkemon, Mario Kart and even
Metroid Prime (if it is possible to do
so). Whether it will surpass that of
The Ocarina of Time remains to be
seen. Link’s ability to morph into a
2-Dimensional shadow gives him the
ability to merge with walls and pass
enemies and obstacles with relative
ease. When combined with the ability
to “fast track” around the map, it is said
that the game never fails to surprise:
A given dungeon, plain or village will
always yield a welcome surprise upon
return.
If you want to reminisce about the
days when your only concern was
the myriad of puzzles contained in
your SNES, Gameboy, Nintendo 64,
to name but a few, A Link Between
Worlds will not fail to disappoint.
By honouring the Nintendo pledge
to continually surprise, it will also
challenge a player. To my mind this
can only be a good thing.
T
he 3DS has sometimes
suﬀered from its line-up,
but it’s always had great
Zelda games. Starting with
Ocarina of Time 3D which
was a great remastering of the original
with a Master Quest. It’s a seriously
good game which was enough for me
to buy a 3DS. Since then there have
been a great many good games for the
3DS, but a Link Between Worlds is
truly a special game not only for the
3DS but for Zelda games in general.
A Link Between Worlds is somewhat
of a Link to the Past remake, but its
more than that. Yes, the world is
pretty close to Link to the Past and
some elements are the same, but it is
really a new game in its own right. The
game has its own charming art style
and Link controls more ﬂuidly than
ever before. Just walking around this
game is fun! The world being similar to
a Link to the Past just provides many
moments of nostalgia, but also causes
moments of surprise when things
are diﬀerent. It’s a modern top down
Zelda and this is a really great thing.
One stand out thing about this game
is the music. It’s a beautiful sounding
score that draws on the soundtrack
to a Link to the Past and will make
you feel so entranced by the magic of
Zelda. Nintendo has had success with
the New Super Mario Bros games and
I feel that this Zelda is akin to that.
The overall feeling of a Zelda game is
there but it is a diﬀerent experience to
play. Players of the Ocarina of Time
remake will enjoy this just as much or
even more!
There are some new features unique
to this game that really make it stand
out. The 3D provides depth and is a
welcome but not necessary feature.
This game brings back the feeling of
the older games in which you must
discover for yourself instead of being
led. Dungeons can now be done in
pretty much whatever order you
want, with the items you need not
being obtained throughout the game
but rented from a cute, and nowhere
near as annoying as Tingle, character
named Ravio. Shortly into the game
you have access to all weapons and
the game allows you to decide which
items you want to rent. At ﬁrst I really
liked this feature, and as I had amassed
a small fortune in Rupees decided to
invest in the whole lot, but then I died.
Shortly after my death Ravio’s assistant
came and took my weapons back to
the shop, meaning I had to travel back
to the shop to rent the items again.
This can get annoying if you ﬁnd a
particular boss hard meaning you die
and need to repeatedly go to the shop
to rent the items you want, but on the
whole the extra freedom you have
enables you to enjoy and explore the
game more as you follow no set path.
The freedom to do the dungeons in
any order is a feature I wish to see in
the future in other Zelda games, but
maybe reﬁned a little. The travelling
required is made better by a handy
Witch who will take you around on
a magic broom to various Weather
Vanes you have discovered, and is a
bit like the teleportation from other
Zelda games. Another new feature
is the ability to merge into walls and
move around. Once you get used to
this (I got stuck for ages because I
forgot I could do this) it makes the
game so much fun. The dungeon
puzzles are the best they have been
in ages and this is largely due to the
merge ability. If I were to play a Link
to the Past again, something this game
really makes you want to do, I would
feel sad that the merge ability is not
there as its already become one of my
favourite game mechanics, not just in
Zelda.
A Link Between worlds isn’t just a
great 3DS game, it’s a great game and
shouldn’t be missed by any Zelda fan.
I strongly believe this game should
be up there with other Franchise
favourites like Ocarina of Time and
Windwaker. The game is a refreshing
new Zelda experience after all the
remakes Nintendo has done. With the
3DS virtual console having Oracle of
Ages and Seasons you can now get the
majority of 2D Zelda games on the
3DS system, and I highly recommend
you pick up this one!
