isiting the Serpentine
Gallery, situated in the
middle of Hyde Park,
usually constitutes a
pleasant lunchtime
distraction. I cannot recommend that
over the next few months. The current
exhibitions are spread across their
two venues; Wael Shawky: al-Qurban
at the Serpentine Gallery and Jake and
Dinos Chapman: Come and See at the
Serpentine Sackler Gallery. Both are,
in their own ways, dark, challenging
and absorbing, requiring serious
investment in the artists’ languages
and totems. Wael Shawky’s
three short ﬁlms are at least relatively
accessible. The emerging middle-
eastern artist is fresh enough not
have yet acquired a Wikipedia page,
yet his brace of prestigious awards
is growing rapidly. His works, most
notably his ﬁlms, explore the history
and culture of the region of his birth,
with an emphasis on questions of
mythmaking, truth and authority.
The Horror Show File and The Path
to Cairo both cinematically retell
the history of the Crusades, utilising
marionettes and unravelling stories
of conﬂict, death and betrayal. The
puppets themselves are on display at
the gallery and are worth examining.
Their grotesque, occasionally
chimeric, design plays on the notions
of mutability and caricature that are
threaded through his explorations of
historical narrative.
Both ﬁlms are narrated in Classical
Arabic, the language of news reports,
lending a superﬁcial authority the
stories, which, in reality, interlace fact
and legend. Allusions like these may
be lost on those (such as myself) who
lack a familiarity with Arab history.
However, the ﬁlms stand on their
own as eerie, atmospheric and self-
contained tales of human nature.
A third ﬁlm, Al Araba Madfuna II, is
also on show. This newer work utilises
child actors to tell two parables by the
Egyptian writer, Mohamed Mustagab.
The cinematography is beautiful and
evocative, anchoring the stories amid
ancient mud building and waterways.
The children’s speech is provided by
adults. They also wear adult clothes
(and fake moustaches) but, far from
veering towards absurdity, the device
lends a strange naivety and pathos to
the parables.
It is diﬃcult to avoid seeing the
show in the light of contemporary
events in the middle-east, many of
which seem to echo those of the past.
The question hangs in the air: how
will the stories we are living through
today be told in years to come?
Any meditations on human nature
and ancient history with which you
leave the gallery are but airy whimsy
in comparison to what the Chapman
brothers have in store for you. For
those who damn contemporary
artists for peddling provocation
and shock, the Chapmans are chief
among sinners. Torture, gore,
genocide, perversion and pain are
their media and they employ them
without restraint. The bewildering
show constitutes a mass of work
dating back to the 90s. The show-
stealers however are a set of four of
the brothers’ infamous dioramas.
For those unfamiliar with the
Chapmans’ work, these deserve some
description. Each piece consists of a
large, intricate diorama composted
of painstakingly painted plastic
models… of Nazis in hell. Whatever
depraved, evil, genocidal activities
you can think oﬀ, the Third Reich and
their skeletal accomplices are doing it
to themselves. The scenes are horriﬁc
illustrations of human evil and overtly
reference Hieronymus Bosch.
The dioramas are only one example
of a cornucopia of confrontational and
darkly humorous works. The gallery is
also populated with mannequins in
the garb of KKK members, peering
at the artwork and lounging on
chairs. Beneath their robes the plastic
Klansmen wear brightly striped
woollen socks.
Whilst nightmarish and shocking,
the Chapman brothers’ work provides
a provocative and thought provoking
exploration of the darker side of
human nature. The show may not be
for everyone, but as an overview of
the artists’ work it is worth a visit for
the adventurous. Art may have lost its
ability to shock, but not to disturb.
