FRIDAY 06 DEC
FEATURES
I then asked each student about how
useful they found the departmental
event and what suggestions they had
to oﬀer – perhaps most tellingly,
Lawrence’s response was to merely
open the Imperial Mobile app on his
iPhone, select the PG Open Day icon
and display the blank page to me. ICT
couldn’t have been too pleased. It was
also suggested that the registration
process was unclear in general and
that departmental activities were
haphazard and not really apparent.
After I’d made several further
unsuccessful attempts at distracting
potential students from the actual
event, I thought I’d annoy some of
the (momentarily) less active booths
and give them someone to talk to,
although we could also go with the
oﬃcial reason of wanting to hear both
sides of the tale.
First I sat myself before the Institute
of Chemical Biology’s Centre for
Doctoral Training (ICB-CDT) booth,
to ﬁgure out what they were all about.
Generally speaking, they were all
about a multi-disciplinary approach
to PG work and focussed on drawing
students with a STEM background
to work on “interfacial projects to
address the world’s problems”. They
plan to take about 15 fully funded
O
ne cold Wednesday
afternoon earlier this
week, your fantastic
Features editor
deigned to trespass
and snoop around formally check out
and report the annual Postgraduate
Open Day happening at the South
Kensington Campus. It was much
less of a hassle than expected, as I had
turned up with Joe Letts’ name card
for clearance purposes but may as well
have come dressed as a school kid for
all the diﬀerence it made.
As an undergraduate myself,
my objective was to ﬁnd out what
motivated people to consider
becoming postgraduates and to come
to or stay at Imperial for PG studies,
and how Imperial addressed their
interests in the form of the Open Day.
The focus point of the day’s
proceedings was the departmental
exhibition in the Great Hall, with each
department also organising their own
tours throughout the day. As such, the
bulk of sleuthing around was conﬁned
to the Sherﬁeld building itself.
It was clear that some departments
were much more bothered about the
even than others; evidenced by the
relative abundance of sweets on oﬀer
atop their tables and the spread of
pamphlets and other assorted paper
what-have-you-nots (that are great for
grabbing and walking away with when
you don’t want to talk to the other
party anymore, handily enough.) The
awesome Physics department even
managed to magic up a ﬂoating shark
to supposedly earmark their location
(the link between the two was beyond
me.)
While lapping the Hall a number of
times that would impress Avogadro,
and trying not to look the part of
a dodgy creeper taking pictures of
people repeatedly, I managed to
circumvent the focal point of the
spotlight away from me a couple of
times, by interviewing some attending
prospective postgraduates.
Lawrence, a 3rd year EEE student
already at the College, felt that he
wanted to come back to continue
his PG studies here because: all his
friends are here – why leave? His other
motivations to pursue a PG degree in
general were so that he could “learn
more technical aspects of things, and
gain specialisation in a particular
ﬁeld – something you don’t get from
the broader scope of a UG degree”. In
addition, he felt he wanted to make
a contribution to academics after
gaining so much from it.
Jane, a UCL Geology MSc alumnus
who’d grown weary after ten years in
the working world and felt becoming
a Doctoral candidate was in order
to spice up her life, put it bluntly:
“Imperial is one of the best places to
do a PhD in Meteorology … especially
as it is twinned and closely linked with
the NHM next door” – who’d have
thought our neighbours would be
luring students in for us?
Thomas, a 3rd year IC Physicist,
and Federico, a 1st year PG student
in the High Energy Particle Physics
(HEPP) focus group decided they
wanted to answer my questions
together. They agreed that carrying on
and doing a PG degree commanded
great recognition and respect even in
today’s hyper-competitive world, and
it was enthusiastically noted to be a
great way to avoid having to get a job.
Plus, it was a perk to remain at the
largest Physics department in the UK!
Ryan, an Accountancy graduate
from Birkbeck (UOL), claimed he
was drawn to Imperial because
in the Petroleum and Geoscience
industries, many employees speak
highly about our graduates and are
usually themselves past students from
here. Furthermore, London is a place
he can’t stay away from, and not many
universities oﬀer the diverse range
of technical specialisation courses
that are available here at IC. He also
revealed that he “regretted not doing
a science degree for UG as it’s more
valuable than what [he] has now –
so [he] reworked his personal 5-Year
Plan to make sure [he] end[s] up in a
technical vocation.”
4-year PhD candidates into their
programme. When asked why they
think students would want to come
to Imperial and walk this path, they
casually let on that Imperial’s ICB-
CDT was one of the founding CDTs in
the country back in 2003 and is world-
leading in its research focuses.
Next, I approached the pair of
Climate-KIC (CK… no, not that
CK) and the Grantham Institute for
Climate Change (GICC). Following a
similar discussion, I gleaned that what
distinguished the two departments
was that while CK was more of a
network for PGs to learn how to
translate their innovative ideas into
business models and a way to gain
entrepreneurship skills (not least
through a 5-week summer school),
GICC was a decentralised body that
worked across many departments at
Imperial to fund PhDs that addressed
their climate and environmental
focuses. Moreover, GICC felt they
were alluring as they were exclusive
to Imperial and oﬀered public
engagement and policy exposure
opportunities, while CK served up
unparallelednetworkingopportunities
due to Imperial’s reputation and good
career opportunities due to industrial
partners.
I also asked all three departments
about how valuable they found the
Open Day event to be in garnering
applications, and what other publicity
strategies they preferred to use – ICB-
CDT said they found it extremely
valuable to be there as usually a third
of their applicants are obtained as
a direct result of the Open Day and
CK expressed similar sentiments,
however GI admitted that they were
present only to “cover all their bases”
and usually got their applications as a
result of word-of-mouth publicity and
the internet.
With my job done, I swiftly grab
a ﬁstful of chocolates from a booth
near one of the exit doors, capped my
camera lens and walked out, savouring
the fact that I was still merely an
undergraduate. TL;DR – become a
postgraduate to avoid getting a job!
