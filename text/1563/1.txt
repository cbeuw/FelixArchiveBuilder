Imperial’s
Charity Week
success -
£70,000 raised!
L
ast Saturday, fundraising
totals were announced for
Charity Week 2013 (CW)
at the annual round-oﬀ
dinner, with Imperial College
students raising a staggering £70,000
in one week.
In October, Imperial College
was graced with the arrival of CW;
a national, student-led initiative
supported by Islamic Relief (one of the
charities comprising the UK’s Disaster
Emergency Committee). It was hosted
by Imperial’s Islamic Society. CW is
an annual campaign that focuses on
creating unity between its volunteers.
While doing so, it also raises money
for orphans and needy children
worldwide – independent of their
race, gender, or religious aﬃliation.
This year it all began on Monday
28 October, with the autumn air
being overpowered by the sweetness
of baked goods, as our campus was
dotted with charity stalls selling cakes
and doughnuts. At sunset, the ﬁrst
charity event of the week kicked oﬀ
– the much renowned “Battle of the
Societies” quiz night (BOTS), an event
in which over 20 societies competed
in to win the coveted BOTS trophy
(won by the AhlulBayt Society). Other
events held during the week included
a ‘HYPE night’ that consisted of
people carrying out dares in return
for sponsorships, an inter-uni football
tournament that was won by our
noisy neighbours King’s College, a
sponsored assault course/sky-diving,
as well as tube and street collections
across London.
The week drew to a close with an
elegant reception at the ﬂagship
Charity Week Dinner, this year held in
the grand Porchester Hall. The dinner

elson Mandela, the last
great national liberator
of the past century,
died yesterday at his
home in Johannesburg
following a 12 year battle with prostate
cancer. Loved around the world as
a freedom ﬁghter and peace maker,
Mandela’s death was announced by
South African President Jacob Zuma
as the loss of the nation’s “greatest son”.
Tributes and condolences came
from around the world with American
President Barack Obama calling

The late Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa and Nobel Peace Prize winner.

in his hands and bent the arc of the
moral universe towards justice”.
Born in 1918, Nelson Mandela
brought the African National
Congress to victory in 1994 in South
Africa’s ﬁrst multiracial elections,
becoming its ﬁrst ever black
president. Eschewing the path trod
by other African liberators such as
Zimbabue’s Robert Mugabe, Mandela
then stood down after just one term,
becoming a global campaigner for
peace and reconciliation. He also put
great energy into the ﬁght against the
scourge of HIV/ AIDs in South Africa,
a disease which in 2005 claimed the
life of his son.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner
became a champion and emblem
of forgiveness after his 27 year
imprisonment, much of it spent in
solitary conﬁnement, for sabotage in
opposing the white minority rule and
racist laws of the country. Released
following intense international
pressure and boycotts, he sought
peace rather than revenge and as
president established the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission which
gave victims of apartheid violence
the opportunity to tell their stories
to their abusers. After leaving oﬃce
he worked for peace across Africa,
including the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Burundi.
Little was seen in public of the elder
statesman since his “retirement from
retirement” in 2004, when he stepped
down from public life, telling his
nation “thanks for being kind for an
old man”. A nation he now leaves in
mourning, but proud.
