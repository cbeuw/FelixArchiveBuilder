Hannah Edmondson interviews Christopher Yates on the inspi-
ration behind his university-set psychological thriller
Drawn in Black Chalk
It started out as a game to win
£10,000, but the stakes were so
much higher than expected.
Christopher Yates’ Black Chalk
centers on six Oxford first years
who set out to play the ultimate
game. Not a game of fake money
or expanding colonies, but a
psychological game that asks its
players to risk what they cherish
most: their self-images, their lives.
While predictable twists and
unrealistic events might be
expected from a thriller like this,
Yates truly excels in suspenseful
plot development. The novel
begins in first person narration by
a character the author describes as
“a hermit living a peculiar life driven
by strange routines.” As the story
progresses, so does the reader’s
relationship with the narrator
and by extension, the characters.
Page by page the reader becomes
more acquainted with this isolated
narrator and his tale only to second-
guess everything learned because of
one sentence or hint.
These cruel realizations and
stunted growth reflect the narrator’s
own experience. His return to his
youthful past shows that this story
is not a coming of age, but rather an
anti-bildungsroman. The narrator
has not grown in life; he has shrunk
until all he knows are the bedroom
walls in his poky Manhattan
apartment. Yates juxtaposes this
cloistered deterioration with the
unending optimism originally
present in the university setting.
When asked why he chose Oxford
as his story’s location, the author
and former alum said, “I love the age
of the characters and their youthful
enthusiasm for holding certain
beliefs, for their desire to experience
life.”
The Oxford setting also fuels
the characters’ increasing interest
in the game. The competitiveness
between these university friends
is what elevates the game to such
unpleasant heights. The rivalry is
present from the beginning, when
the group tries to outdo each other’s
underprivileged backgrounds,
and becomes increasingly more
vicious as the story goes on.
The tipping point comes when
the narrator critiques another
player’s intelligence, for while
“obscenities were not terms with
which they could hurt or offend
one another, such words meant
almost nothing […] never had any
of them called another stupid.”
Through the backdrop of the game,
the author explores this theme of
competitiveness, so prevalent in
campus life, while ridiculing the
students’ conceit.
However, not everything is
gloom and doom in this tale.
Yates offers comic relief through
Jack, the typical clown of the
group, and the obscure memory
techniques of the narrator. In one
passage, the narrator is standing
naked above a salad bowl trying
to remember what the mnemonic
device represents. He eventually
realises the undressed salad is a
reminder for him to clothe himself.
While Yates depicts a brutal side
to humanity, he inserts humorous
scenes and realistic situations, such
as six friends hanging out at the pub
or one student staying up all night
to finish the three papers he has due
the next day, to make his characters
relatable, and identifiable. It’s like
Lord of the Flies in a familiar setting.
Nothing is quite what it seems
in Black Chalk. The game, the
characters, the narrator are not
as straightforward as they first
seem, for, as the author reminds
us in the introduction, nothing in
this tale is to be trusted. Even the
motives behind the individuals are
unreliable, making readers question
what truly drives people.
Once the characters move
past the ingrained social rules of
being respectful to others, caring
for all, loving their neighbors as
themselves, they see what actually
motivates them: power, success,
and the desire to be loved. Once
the white chalk rules are erased,
the characters’ genuine outlines are
revealed, drawn in plain black chalk.
Hannah Edmondson: What was the
inspiration behind Black Chalk?
Christopher Yates: The inspiration
for Black Chalk came from real life.
I really did have an idea to play a
game of psychological dares much
like the one played in my story. This
was something me and my friends
chatted about in the bar a great deal,
trying to come up with interesting
forfeits for each other. I think it’s
very fortunate that we never did
play because it means we’re all still
friends.
HE: How did your personal
experience at Oxford influence
your novel?
CY: There’s a lot of my own personal
experience in Black Chalk. Not a
single one of the events that occur
in the book actually took place in
reality but I used my own experience
to shape the settings and plot. And
it was my own experience of Oxford
that helped me in trying to build as
plausible a tale as possible. I suppose
you might say that my own Oxford
experiences are the DNA of Black
Chalk.
HE: Why did you choose a
university setting?
CY: I loved everything about writing
a novel that used a university for
its setting. I loved the age of the
characters and their youthful
enthusiasm for holding certain
beliefs, for their desire to experience
life. The intimacy of such a setting is
also a huge plus to a writer; I went
to a college of around 400 people
which meant that, to some degree,
I knew just about everyone there,
and this creates an atmosphere that
can be both excitingly convivial
and frighteningly suffocating. All
excellent ingredients.
HE: In what way do you see this
novel as a bildungsroman or rather
a missed bildungsroman?
CY: Yes, I suppose there’s a sense
in which it’s a bildungsroman in
reverse because what we see is
not the psychological growth of
someone but actually their decline.
The narrator doesn’t come of age in
the world so much as want to lock
themselves away from the world
that’s uncovered.
HE: Which of the characters did
you find it hardest to write about?
CY: The narrator was the hardest
character for me to pin down. The
story is told fourteen years on from
when the game began. We know right
from the start that the narrator’s
been damaged by this mysterious
game and that the narrator is a
hermit living a peculiar life driven
by strange routines. So the narrator
has no one to talk to but the reader,
which means I had to find a way to
suck the reader in without using any
dialogue between characters (and
I have a particular love for writing
dialogue). So this was a challenge to
write. But challenges can be fun. And
challenges can also lead to bursts of
creative thought. So in the end, I was
very happy with my peculiar hermit.
HE: Which authors are you
influenced by?
CY: Graham Greene for his sense
of writing meaningful books with
great prose; but not for one second
does he ever forget to entertain
and beguile his reader. And this
is something Donna Tartt does
brilliantly as well. Also Vladimir
Nabokov for his love of language
and games (he is constantly toying
with his reader, a chess player who’s
several moves ahead of you). And
I love great sentence-writers such
as Martin Amis, John Updike and
Cormac McCarthy.
