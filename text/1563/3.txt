L
ast week, Universities
UUK, the UK’s universities
representative organisation
issued guidance on helping
universities manage external
speakers.
They concluded that universities
can segregate students during speaker
events when required, as long as there
is fair access to both genders.
The report states that, “assuming
the side-by-side segregated seating
arrangement is adopted, there does
not appear to be any discrimination on
gender grounds merely by imposing
segregated seating. Both men and
women are being treated equally, as
they are both being segregated in the
same way. Concerns to accommodate
the wishes or beliefs of those opposed
to segregation should not result in a
religious group being prevented from
having a debate in accordance with its
belief system.”
Nicola Dandridge, the UUK chief
executive said “These are issues that
are arising all the time and these are
really diﬃcult issues. What emerged
from our work on this particular issue
is that there is no clearly deﬁned right
or wrong here as to whether to allow or
outlaw segregation. It is going to very
much depend on the facts of the case.
External speakers play an important
role in university life, not least in
terms of encouraging students to
think for themselves, challenge other
people’s views and develop their own
opinions. Although most speakers are
uncontroversial, some will express
contentious, even inﬂammatory or
oﬀensive views. Universities have to
balance their obligation to encourage
free speech with their duties to ensure
that the law is observed, the safety and
security of staﬀ, students and visitors
secured, and good campus relations
promoted. In practice, achieving this
balance is not always easy.”

UUK’s report on gender
segregated seating
was attended by over 300 students,
many with their families. Inspiring
speeches were given throughout
the dinner, with the guest speakers
painting a vivid picture of the suﬀering
taking place around the world. An
enthralling auction soon followed,
which saw beautiful canvases go for
as much as £2,000 a piece, as well
as intricately decorated cakes being
sold for nearly £400! All in all it was
a heart-warming sight seeing students
uniting together under one roof for a
noble cause, and more than £23,000
was raised on the night for orphans
and needy children.
However, that was not the end of
Charity Week, as the weekend saw the
return of the now UK famous Smoky
not Smudgy ladies pampering event.
Bigger and better, this consisted of a
massive bazaar, as well as two fashion
shows. Hundreds of students from
both Imperial and other universities
attended, as well as famous bloggers
who were invited as special guests.
Overall, Imperial College came
third nationally, raising a monumental
£69,697. To put this number into
context, this is nearly half the total
amount of money raised by Imperial
students during the whole of last
year (£147,684), through RAG,
Medics RAG and CW 2012! With
Charity Week celebrating its 10th
year anniversary this year, a massive
£2,993,176 has been raised to date,
and this ﬁgure continues to grow
rapidly each year.
As Charity Week 2013 draws to
a close, volunteers now have the
opportunity to vote for the projects
that they would like the money raised
to go towards. It is memories such
as those formed in CW that help
shape our students, sprouting and
developing their ambition to grow
both personally and on a societal level.
The Islamic Society commented on
this achievement: “We would like to
thank everyone who made Charity
Week the success that it was this year,
from the dozens of volunteers who
took part, to the Union who were
supportive throughout – this was truly
a collective Imperial College eﬀort
and is a testament to what we students
can achieve through dedication and
uniting together for a common cause.
We pray that our eﬀorts go some way
to fulﬁlling our obligation to serving
humanity and helping those less
fortunate than ourselves.”
Charity Week 2014, we wait for you
with much impatience.

right direction — Still silent.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE CHARITY WEEK 2013
O
ver 100 protesters
occupied the
University of London
(UoL’s) headquarters
on Wednesday 4
December. The protest took place
to demonstrate against the UoL’s
“undemocratic and unaccountable”
running.
The protesters demanded 10 things,
that included scraping plans to close
the University of London Union
(ULU), paying the London living wage
to UoL staﬀ, as well as improving
the sick and holiday pay. They said
that they would not leave until their
demands were met. The protest was
not organised by social media, instead
it was organised by word of mouth.
50 police oﬃcers attended the UoL
oﬃce to remove the demonstrators.
Police arrested three protesters; two
have now been released, however, one
has been held for assaulting a police
oﬃcer. The police said that they were
there to stop the breach of peace.
The UoL Chief Operating Oﬃcer,
Chris Cobb sent a letter to the
protesters at 5pm on the evening
cautioning them “if you do not leave
the building peacefully within the next
hour (by 6pm this evening) then I shall
request our Security Staﬀ to remove
you, and to call upon the police for
assistance if necessary.”
The ULU commented: “Initial
reports indicate that protesters were
assaulted by both police and security:
thrown to the ground, kicked and
punched, and dragged to the ground
by their hair.
This evening, the University of
London colluded once again with
police to evict occupiers, in a violent
attempt to harass and silence dissent
on campus. Their actions are a
disgrace, and show their disregard
for both the welfare of their students
and their own university community.
Occupations are a legitimate form of
dissent. When our university exploits
our staﬀ, shuts down our student
union, and are utterly unaccountable
to the students and staﬀ that give it
life and make it function, students
have no choice but to gain leverage in
whatever way they can.”
