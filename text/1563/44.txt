This week you are praised by
a computer generated voice
every 15 minutes. After the first
five days of basking in the adul-
terated worship you decide to
take it one step further and you
connect your computer to twit-
ter and apply a pseudo-mar-
kov generator which causes
chaos, destroying the central
library. Somehow.
SO THIS WEEK. WOW!
MUCH AMAZE. VERY
GOOD TIME. WHY
CAGE? SO HUNGRY.
MUCH MOON SHINES.
SO TRANSFORM. VERY
RAGE. MUCH HOWL.
NICE WOLF.
This week you buy Christmas
dinner at the Union, after
being convinced by the
convincing blogs by the
Union DPFS and President.
Little do you know, much like
Polari, this is a secret signal
to the Union hack subculture
who approach you with
hopes of discussing Council
papers.
This week you are featured
on a new Spotted at Imperial
page. Except this page refers
to your possessions instead.
“Spotted in the Library, one red
pencil case with a name tag for
Jodie”. As you hurry to collect
your belongs your praise the
existence of the page and won-
der what the fuss was about.
It’s mostly harmless right?
This week you roar into the
Beit Quad on your pimped up
scooter, wearing furs and ex-
aggerating about the size of
your genitalia. Unfortunately
nobody is amused since it’s
winter and sane person walks
around topless and wearing
sunglasses. You realise your
stepped into to wrong era and
return to your time machine.
This week is the last week of
term! Hurrah! As the quality
of your work begins to dete-
riorate and you begin to fre-
quently drink unusual quanti-
ties of alcohol, responsibly,
you wonder why you even
bother with this whole study-
ing thing and decide to take a
weekend trip to Siberia in your
shorts. You die. #YOLOSWAG
This week you realise that the
NSA is tracking you wherever
you go. Deciding to fuck with
their minds a little, you deicide
to leave your phone in a Brit-
ish Airways check-on luggage
bag. You laugh as your glob-
trotting travels are bound to
confuse the NSA who know you
are a mere engineer, until they
comethoughyourdoorat1AM.
This week you decide to enter
the RCSU Science Challenge.
After taking advantage of the
free bottle of wine that the event
organisers paid through the nose
for, you realise that you need
practise. So you decide to open
Felix, pick a section and send a
message to the email at the top
of the left hand page, with an ar-
ticle. You win all! Much amaze!
You start on your journey to
Law School wearing your
workshop overalls from your
last lab. As you enter the door
the snobby OxBridge toffs
snub you, walking past with
their fresh game in search of
a kitchen. You have the last
laugh since you went to Impe-
rial and watch a lot of CSI. It’s
not real science you know...
This week you are a unicorn. Wait,
do you exist? How can you tell? Is
the pain that you feel real? In or-
der to test the probability of your
reality you decide to disguise your-
self and go to a PETA meeting.
Severalhourslaterwithyouearsbleed-
ing from the shear crap forced through
them you resign yourself to your fate
in the corporeal world and start chas-
ing rainbows. You fall of the balcony.
This week you decide that
you’ve had enough of the drivel
that you read in the horoscopes
and decide to send in your
own. I mean really, the person/
thing that writes these mush
have never seen a real horo-
scope. After several success-
ful weeks your horoscopes
become too successful and
you wish for a simpler life.
This weak ewe decide two take
a different approach to righting.
Instead ov taking you’re thyme
and thinking a head ewe de-
cide to just put down what ewe
r thinking. Butt know one finds
the knew ewe funny and ewe
just end up in a corner, alone
and sad. Ewe decide ewe
don’t knead them anyway and
become a street busker...

Farah Announces
Marriage Going
Well

ollowing the news that Tom
Daley is no longer single, Mo
Farah has conﬁrmed that
his marriage is still “going
swimmingly”.
The news comes much to the chagrin
of Farah’s many admirers who had
secretly hoped his 2010 marriage to
Tania Nell was on the ropes.
“Since I found out Daley’s taken,
I was hoping Mo’s marriage had
deteriorated” said one secret admirer.
“I mean there’s always Greg
Rutherford, but he’s from Milton
Keynes, so he’s probably really boring”
“Are there no single 2012 GBR
medallists left?”
Get Fined For Rate-Rigging
A
fter a prolonged period
of months in which
they had neither fucked
over the economy nor
siginifcantly defrauded
anyone, the banks this week decided
that they would get themselves
ﬁned £1.4 billion for forming
illegal cartels to rig interest rates.
A spokesman for Barclays said "We
felt the time was ripe for another
banking scandal".
"At Barclays, we are committed to
being involved in a new outrageous
revelation on an annual basis" he
continued.
"In fact, we feel this is the banks
greatest misdemeanor since playing a
major role in the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis."
The scam, which essentially involved
several banks agreeing not to change
their interest rates and thereby protect
their own obscenely vast assests, came
nearly a full year since the last scandal.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, not one
to miss out on a major banking crisis,
again played a key role in the cartel.
This time however, they got ﬁned.
Although since the bank is publically
owned, it seems as if they cheekily got
the public to pay for this one too.
Thankfully, the two banks who faced
the biggest ﬁnes - Barclays and UBS -
grassed on their fellow banks and thus
avoided ﬁning at all.
