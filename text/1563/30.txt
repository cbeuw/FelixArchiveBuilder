TELEVISION
2013: A Television Odyssey
Emily Fulham looks back at some of the TV highlights of the year
P
hineas and Ferb is a show
that’s all about formulae.
Almost every episode of
the show follows a fairly
rigid structure: it’s about
two pre-teen stepbrothers on their
summer holidays, and every day
they decide to do something that’s
creatively impossible (opening a
restaurant, or building a city-spanning
rollercoaster, or building a rocket), at
which point their controlling teenage
sister Candace tries to “bust” them
by showing their mum the dangerous

New Shows
Hannibal
A surprise hit, HBO’s Hannibal was a
slow burner that turned out to be one
of the best shows of the year. A lot of
credit goes to Mads Mikkelsen for his
ﬂawless performance as everyone’s
favourite cannibal, but Hugh Dancy
also deserves praise in his portrayal of
Will Graham, the unstable FBI agent
Hannibal deceives and manipulates,
as his grasp on sanity becomes
increasingly tenuous. Throw in a
great supporting cast, inspired guest
stars (including Eddie Izzard as
you’ve never seen him before) and
cinematography that makes even
the most brutal murder look oddly
beautiful, and you’ve got an intriguing
premise for a show which is far more
than your standard crime procedural.
Sleepy Hollow
Another surprising success, Sleepy
Hollow combined the unlikely part-
ners of apocalyptic horror and Ameri-
can history with unforeseen success.
Ichabod Crane, Oxford professor and
Civil War soldier, is transported into
the future thanks to a curse from the
Headless Horseman, where he part-
ners up with local policewoman Abbie
Mills to solve supernatural mysteries.
The 21st century takes Crane some
getting used to, with coﬀee machines
and the concept of paying for bottled
water some of the biggest obstacles. A
likeable cast and a propensity to not
take itself too seriously gave Sleepy
Hollow its edge in the latest wave of
Autumn shows imported from the US.
things they’ve been doing. Just before
she can show Mom, the amazing
creation of the boys is cleaned up
thanks to the antics of their pet
platypus, Perry, who is actually a
secret agent battling his nemesis Dr.
Doofenshmirtz on a daily basis (I
am not making a single word of this
up), leaving Mom to think Candace
is crazy. At some point there’s also a
musical number, because why not?
Besides the catchy tunes and
creative high concept wacky fun,
the real appeal of the show is in
how it plays with the formulae it
creates for itself. The ﬁrst episode is
the archetypal one – every point in
the checklist is ticked in a rote way
– but after that it gets interesting.
The characters become aware of the
routine, and some try to actively ﬁght
it, while others learn to live with it.
For example, in one episode, Candace
tries to keep staring at the Thing the
boys make for the whole day. (It then
turns invisible as soon as she turns her
head.) In another, Doofenshmirtz has
a waiting room for Perry the Platypus
to wait in while he ﬁnishes his latest
evil contraption (which, as a group,
he calls his “-inators”), because, of
course, Perry can’t foil his evil scheme
until he’s ﬁnished preparing it.
It extends beyond main story
beats, though. There’s an assortment
of catchphrases, running gags,
recurring characters, and settings
that get introduced, built up, and
then deconstructed in various
amusing ways. In early episodes,
Doofenshmirtz talked about various
tragic backstories he had which made
him want to do his various schemes
(“It all began on the day of my actual
birth. Both of my parents failed to
show up.”), but eventually it devolves
into “when I was a boy my mother
would never let me swim in public
pools… What? That’s it! You know, not
every back story has to have some big,
in-depth spiel.”
The creators have shown a very
keen understanding of TV show
tropes and formulae, and of how to
play with them, but they are just plain
funny. Most of the best gags come
from Doofenshmirtz (who is voiced
by one of the creators), but everyone
gets great lines at some points.
For most of this review I’ve just
been going “oh and that time where
that thing happened was so funny!”
but that’s kind of how it is. The
characters aren’t especially dynamic
or remarkable, and, for the most part,
they don’t get much room to grow.
The plots are deliberately repetitive
(with some notable exceptions). The
main thing the show has going for it is
that it just has really solid, clever, and
funny dialogue – it’s just a collection
of really great gags.
At over 200 episodes, it’s Disney
Channel’s longest running show,
surviving long past the channel’s
move away from animation towards
lame sitcoms, purely on the basis of it
being just that good; deﬁnitely worth
checking out.
Finales
Breaking Bad
After ﬁve glorious series, we ﬁnally
bade farewell to Walter White, the
meth dealer who made students
everywhere look at their Chemistry
teachers with new-found respect.
The ﬁnal series started oﬀ with a bang
(literally), and rarely let up the pace.
With more plot twists and shocking
moments than you can shake a stick
at, Breaking Bad kept audiences on
the edge of their seats until the very
last episode. With actors Bryan Paul
and Aaron Paul consistently outstand-
ing in every scene, the ﬁnal stage in
Walter’s metamorphosis from unas-
suming high school teacher to master-
mind drug lord cemented the show’s
status as one of the greatest of all time.
The IT Crowd
The escapades of Roy, Maurice and
Jen came to an end as one of Britain’s
best comedies in recent years grace-
fully bowed out in September. And
graceful it was – with each of the ac-
tors going on to bigger things (Chris
O’Dowd now a familiar face in Hol-
lywood blockbusters and Richard
Ayoade a well-received director in his
own right), The IT Crowd chose to go
out on a high. With nods to some of
the highlights of previous series and
several fan-favourite cameos, the ﬁ-
nal episode was a crowd-pleaser all
round. Undoubtedly, the sitcom will
be sorely missed, and we’ll have to
wait until next year for Channel 4’s
other comedy jewel, Peep Show, to re-
turn to help ease the pain.
2014
Previews
Game of Thrones
Game of Thrones tested its reputation
for killing oﬀ characters to the max in
the ‘Red Wedding’ of the penultimate
episode of its third series. Those who
knew what was coming watched be-
tween their ﬁngers as (spoiler alert)
the Starks proved themselves to be the
most ill-fated family in the whole of
Westeros. The fourth series, starting
in Spring, will continue to deal with
the aftermath of the event, as well as
building up to the series’ next wedding
between the hateful King Joﬀrey and
Margaery Tyrell.
Girls
The much-talked about show has di-
vided opinions, with loyal fans and
skeptics abound. Hannah Horvath
and crew return in January; while de-
tails of any storylines are being kept
tightly under wraps, it’s a safe assump-
tion that there’ll be plenty more nu-
dity, painfully awkward sex scenes and
interesting hairdos.
Doctor Who
OK, it might not be on until August,
but the news that Peter Capaldi has
been chosen as the 12th Doctor has al-
ready got everyone hyped up. Fans of
The Thick of It will be intrigued to see
if he can shake oﬀ his foul-mouthed
persona to play the family favourite
Doctor.
