Extinction, death and dinosaurs
Rosamund Pearce writes for I, Science on resurrecting the extinct
T
he loss of a species was
once thought to be as
ﬁnal as the demise of its
last survivor but now,
thanks to advances in
biotechnology, reviving an extinct
species is no longer pure ﬁction. But
instead of asking “can it be done?” the
conversation is changing to “should it
be done?”
The possibility of bringing
species back from the grave – a
process known as de-extinction
– was widely popularised by
Michael Crichton’s 1990 book, and
Spielberg’s 1993 ﬁlm, Jurassic Park.
Inspired by the advent of genetic
engineering, Crichton’s tale gained
cult-status, but just as Aldous Huxley’s
vision of artiﬁcial reproduction was
brought closer with the advance
of IVF technology, so the process
of de-extinction has moved from
sci-ﬁ concept to real life science.
In2003,ateamofFrenchandSpanish
scientists achieved the impossible
task of bringing a species back from
the dead, although only temporarily.
The Pyrenean Ibex was a large,
mountain-dwelling member of
the goat genus Capra that went
extinct due to grazing pressure
from domestic and wild ungulates
in 2000. When the last Pyrenean
Ibex died, its cells were preserved
and, later, a nucleus from these cells
was injected into a denucleated
domestic goat egg, which was then
implanted into a surrogate mother.
In 2003, a clone was born. For
the ﬁrst time ever an animal had
been brought back from extinction.
Sadly, the baby ibex died shortly
after birth due to lung defects. Rather
than rejuvenating the Pyrenean
Ibex, it served only to provide
an unfortunate demonstration
of the obstacles that remain in
reproductive cloning technology.
Not only that, but of the 439
eggs used, only 57 developed into
embryos, only four made it to full
term, and only one survived to birth
– a pretty poor survival percentage.
Despite these problems, this
breakthrough gave hope to the
emerging de-extinction movement
and, propelled by a combination
of curiosity and conservation,
many more de-extinction
attempts are on the horizon.
The Tasmanian tiger and the
passenger pigeon are just two of
the candidates being vetted for
resurrection. Furthermore, in March
2013, a team from the University
of New South Wales announced
that they were attempting to
bring back the gastric brooding
frog – a bizarre creature that
used its stomach as a womb.
The birth of the ibex has also
fuelled more ambitious and
controversial ideas. For instance,
could such technology be applied
to ancient, long-dead species?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem
like dinosaurs will be brought back
any time soon as DNA decays with
time, and cloning technologies
require pristine DNA for success.
Within hours of death, cells start
the process of apoptosis, which
releases enzymes that shatter
DNA into an indecipherable mess.
As it ages, DNA also undergoes
chemical changes that alter the
nucleotides – the base guanine
changes into adenine, and
cytosine changes to thymine.
So much time has passed that it’s
inconceivable the full genome of
dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus
Rex, which died out around 65
million years ago, would have
survived to the present day.
Could a woolly mammoth be a
more realistic goal? Disappearing
better use by boosting the populations
of currently endangered species.
In anticipation of this, San Diego
Zoo has created the ‘Frozen Zoo’
project, a biobank storing tissue
from over 1,000 extant species.
In a similar vein to the Millennium
Seed Bank Project, it is hoped
that the Frozen Zoo can help the
survival of critically endangered
species as well as providing a kind of
insurance policy against extinction.

Like it or not, de-extinction
technology does have a future. When
science is this exciting we just can’t
help being curious. After all, who
wouldn’t jump at the chance to see a
real life woolly mammoth? Whether
or not it leads to the all-action
sci-ﬁ ending remains to be seen.

on the theme of life and death in I,
Science this week!
between 6,000-10,000 years ago,
well-preserved mammoths are
routinely dug out of the Siberian
tundra and scientists have been able
to collect enough DNA fragments
to piece the genome back together.
Sadly, cloning requires much
more than a reconstructed genome.
Artiﬁcially assembling DNA can be
done easily with current technology,
but free-ﬂoating DNA is of little use to
a cell. The real challenge is packaging
the DNA into chromosomes and
inserting this into a nucleus. The
shape of the DNA aﬀects how it
interacts with chemicals in the
cell, and these interactions control
gene expression, a factor every bit
as important as the DNA itself.
Finding a living mammoth cell
would sidestep such diﬃculties, and
a Japanese-Russian collaboration is
currently leading the hunt for such a
cell. The team plan to use a technique
pioneered for cloning mammals
from frozen tissue, which was
successfully implemented on a mouse
that had been frozen for 16 years.
The idea is for an elephant to then be
used as an egg donor and surrogate to
grow the properly packaged DNA. If a
good soft-tissue sample is found, the
researchers say a woolly mammoth
could be born in a matter of years.
Even so, there is a great diﬀerence
between bringing back an individual
and bringing back a viable population.
De-extinction would at best produce
a handful of individuals that may or
may not reproduce. And how can
we engineer the mammoth’s social
structureandbehaviouraladaptations?
Despite these challenges,
ambitious plans have already
been made for a Pleistocene
Park in North-Eastern Siberia.
In a similar spirit to the Jurassic
Park of literary ﬁction, the dream is
to restore the tundra to the mammoth
steppe, a vast grassland habitat.
Bison and reindeer have already been
reintroduced, but the arrival of the
mammoth may take a little longer.
Unsurprisingly, de-extinction is
highly controversial. The implications
of such initiatives are hard to predict,
and there are questions regarding
the well-being of the clones.
Recent sequencing of Neanderthal
DNA has made cloning the homo
species theoretically possible, bringing
us into unfamiliar ethical territory.
Even eﬀorts to resurrect recently
extinct animals are divisive.
While advocates say that we have
a moral responsibility to bring
back the creatures we drove to
extinction, critics argue that such
strategies hinder eﬀorts to save the
habitats and species that remain.
