Dear Felix,
This is just a brief note to
remind everybody that Phoenix,
the I.C. Arts magazine, is
scheduled to be published before
the end of this year. To do this, we
need contributions. These can be
almost anything (within reason) -
poetry, prose, artwork,
photography, etc. The only proviso
is that any writing should be
reasonably short (500 words
absolute max). All contributions
must be in by the 25th May 1995.
They can be sent to the Felix office,
or directly to me, the editor, either
by internal or e-mail.

They Leave in
Shame
Dear FELIX,
We've been together at Imperial
for four years and we value the
close friendship between us and all
the good friends we've made and
the good times we've had here,
including many a pleasant evening
in Southside and the Union Bar.
However, during all this time,
we have never felt the need to
regale our fellow students with the
sight of our genitals. We have
justified this selfish attitude of ours
by noting that in the sad,
oppressive world outside Imperial,
where the enlightened libral
attitudes of the Constituent
College Unions' Social Clubs sadly
do not prevail, such behaviour
could result in arrest by the Police
and criminal prosecution.
We realise now that we have
been reaping the social rewards of
being members of Imperial
College student society while
ourselves not respecting its
illustrious traditions and not
making the effort to adopt its
groundbreaking standards of
behaviour and social conscience.
We hereby wish to apologise
for this staggering display of
insensitivity on our part, and make
public our contrition and shame.
We realise it is now too late to
make amends, as it is not possible
to atone in the little time we have
left here for the sins of our four
years. We wish also to thank our
fellow Imperial students of the
CCU Social Clubs for the tactful
tolerance they have displayed in
the face of our arrogant
presumptions. They have our
sincere esteem and admiration,
but we will not insult their modesty
with unworthy flattery. No praise
can speak louder of them than the
paean of their actions.
Yours etc,
George Karaolides

Size Matters

Yes, and it can only get smaller at this rate! With everyone
leaving F E L I X for exams the editor, like Will Carling without

How can you help this dire situation? By finally writing that
article you've been planning all year! It's the summer term,
everything's looser and the wackiest ideas will be gratefully
accepted at the FELIX office, north-west Beit Quad.
Remember: An Editor is for Summer not just for Christmas
