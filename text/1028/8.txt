House hufrfrng started badly when only
one of us hunted for a house. The rest either
languished in foreign countries or in bed. The
problem with hyperj
competent friends is that
you can end up piling too much straw onto their
backs and you never realise when they break

O n e : F i n d a house together. Ditch hyper-
competent friends and move in with disorganised
wafers). .
