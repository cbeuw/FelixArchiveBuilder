The annual Rag fete took place on
the Queen's Lawn on Wednesday,
writes Andy Sinharay. Various
activities from stuffing cream
crackers to talking to giant flowers,
were on offer to the punters, all in
aid of charities such as the Red
Cross and the Marie Curie Cancer
Research Fund. Ian Robertson,
RAG Chair, told F E L I X that
there was some concern about the
weather, threatening attendance and
bringing the long-awaited mud-
wrestling into doubt. "When we had
the sun, the place was packed for
half an hour," Mr Robertson
explained. However one activity on
offer, the opening of Queen's Tower
which allowed panoramic views for
SOp climb, proved so popular that
many called for the Tower to be
open all year round. Luckily as the
day wore on, the weather held.
Mud-wrestling finally took place in
the late afternoon, and the
remaining faithful were lucky
enough to be drawn into the messy
fray! Rag have raised in excess of
Â£20,000 sofar this year.

undergraduate and postgraduate
colleges into a fraction of the
original space would lead to an
improvement i n facilities. The
new site at Imperial is planned to
house both St Mary's and
Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical Schools, the National
Heart and L u n g Institute and
the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School. The possibility of the
Institute of Cancer Research
joining is still being considered
but the building will definitely
include Imperial College's
Department of Biology.
The sometimes acrimonious
Westminster debate saw the
Government under pressure
from both Conservative MP's as
well as the Opposition. M r s
Bottomley was accused of
storming ahead with unpopular
and discredited proposals. These
were described as cost-cutting
measures which threaten patient
care and research. The bulk of
the discussion clearly focussed
on the controversial decisions to
scrap accident and emergency
services at a number of London
hospitals. The call to reconsider
the 'widely challenged assum-
ptions that underpin the
Tomlinson Report' could also
have implications for the
changes planned for medical
education and research.

N U S Last Day
Remember that today is your last
chance to vote i n the N U S
referendum. It is difficult to
guess at the result at the moment.
Early on it seemed like the 'no'
voters were staying away, hoping
that the vote would be inquorate.
As the week has progressed
however, they too have begun to
cast ballots, fearful of one
thousand 'yes' votes. I'm actually
quite excited that the whole
thing is coming to an end at last.
Full results and analysis, as they
say, in next week's issue.
Begging Bowl
Well this week we've had to drop
to sixteen pages. I don't blame
anyone - I know how scared
people are about getting a job and
obtaining the necessary quality of
degree - but I hope no-one
blames me! In an attempt to halt
the slow insidious decline we
will, from next week, be letting
loose some of the things we've
wanted to do all year. I hope it
doesn't appear to gratuitous.
A l l contributions still very
gratefully accepted.
VE Day
Call me a friendless (veteran)
thanker but I found myself alone
in Hyde Park on monday night.
The atmosphere was strange.
Unlike one acquaintance I made
no attempt to break into the
secure celebration 'compound' .
Instead I walked the grounds
amongst tens of thousands of
others. It seemed more a rock
festival than an official state day
of celebration, such was the mix
of people and the heady
combination of poor amps,
smoke, and lights. Oh, and the
tourists.
I did find myself wondering
at one stage just how many, i f
any, of the assembled were
actually British! I heard in fact
more of the 1940's 'baddies'
accents! It reminded me of an old
science fiction story I once read.
It featured the experience of a
group of time-travelling Christ-
ian Tourists (it was written i n
straight faced 1950's superscience
speak so don't smirk) who go on
a tour to see the selection of Jesus
over Barabus as the criminal to
be sent to his death.
They are told by the travel
company that under no circum-
stances could they attempt to
save Christ, as this would alter
the timeline. Instead, they are
dressed in robes and encouraged
to chant for Barbaras along with
the Jews. As the tempo rises the
cries get more fierce; only at the
last moment do they notice the
Jews are silent around the edges
of the crowd, w h i c h consists
entirely of tourists.
Why were the cheers for an
ancient Vera Lynn so strident?
