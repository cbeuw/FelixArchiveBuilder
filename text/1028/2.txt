Rector Disagrees
Wednesday's Board of Studies
meeting saw the Rector, Sir
Ronald O x b u r g h , deliver his
emphatic response to the New
Academic Framework, proposed
for University of London ( U L )
degrees. H i s reply, w h i c h
emphasises the difference i n
standard between Imperial's
degrees and those awarded by
other U L Colleges, was accepted
without complaint by the Board.
The New Academic Frame-
work, a paper by Professor
Andrew Rutherford, V i c e
Chancellor of the University of
London, calls for standards to be
set across U L so that the quality
of the degrees given by its
different Colleges would be
uniform. In what amounts to an
important statement of univer-
sity policy, he says that there is a
B Y A N D R E W S M I T H
£20million from the H i g h e r
Education Funding Council of
England ( H E F C E ) has been
promised to Imperial College for
the construction of the new Basic
Medical Sciences building. The
future of the project depends on
an impending decision by the
Department of Health (DoH) as
to whether it wishes to give
another £20m to the scheme. The
undertaking will see up to five
medical institutions merging to
form a new Imperial College
Medical School.
Mystery surrounds the
announcement of the H E F C E
money as the body itself has still
not formally declared their
funding of the project. It was
V i r g i n i a Bottomley, the em-
battled Secretary of State for
Health, who announced the
funding i n a Press Statement
which also covers the proposed
closure of a number of London
Hospitals.
H E F C E have insisted that
need for better communication
and the demonstration of the
'collective aims and objectives' of
the different colleges.
Somewhat isolated amongst
his U L colleagues, Sir Ronald
responded that "parity of degree
standards between universities in
the United Kingdom is a chimera
... and the same arguments apply
within the largest university in
the U n i t e d K i n g d o m , which
contains institutions disparate in
size and mission."
Student Penury
The numbers of students using
the I C U advice service has gone
up in recent weeks, highlighting
fears that increasing numbers of
Imperial students are suffering
acute financial hardship.
Speaking to F E L I X , D o n
Adlington, IC's student advisor,
said that "over the past few years
the financial problem has got
systematically worse." He com-
mented that money worries were
an important part of student life,
and that he was seeing very
careful students being unable to
survive on their grants.
they themselves have not
officially announced their
funding, emphasising that a
formal statement on the overall
finance will not be made until
the D o H decides whether to
contribute its £20m to the
proposed merger.
Speaking to F E L I X Anna
W h e l a n , Imperial College's
Planning Officer, attempted to
downplay suggestions that the
money is in the pipeline. She too
emphasised that the H E F C E
funding depends on it being
matched by the D o H but added
that "we all hope very much that
it will go ahead." It is still not
clear when a final decision will
be made but the College's
Planning Department, which has
coordinated applications, is
expecting it 'any day'.
F E L I X understands that
the Rector, who previously
worked closely with Tory leaders
as Chief Scientific Adviser to the
Government, is confident that all
the money will come through. It
appears though that the the
Cheaters Stay at Home
The University of L o n d o n
Academic Committee, meeting
on May 1, decided that students
caught cheating in University of
London exams, which include all
those Imperial College students
take, will be dealt with by each
U L College internally. T h e
closely run ballot of the cross-
section of students and academics
from the various U L Colleges
who attended the committee
meeting saw the motion being
passed by the slender majority of
only 21 votes to 17.
Too Many Students...
Imperial College has indicated
that Constituent College Union
freshers who normally have their
get-togethers during the first
week in the Great Hall will no
longer be able to use this venue.
There are now too many students
entering first year to fit i n the
room for the welcome initiations.
Instead freshers will have to trek
along E x h i b i t i o n Road to the
Kensington Gore corner to meet
in the Royal Geographical
Society.
project may be put in jeopardy by
the Department of Health's wish
that it be tested under its new
Private Finance Initiative. The
resultant delay that this would
incur worries those planning the
mergers, with M s W h e l a n
admitting that her department
definitely d i d not want the
building to come under the new
initiative.
Another problem looming is
that of the proposed demolition
of the Royal College of Science II
building which is expected to
take place over the Summer.
With this 19th Century building
in a 'conservation area', certain
sources have suggested that local
authorities may find their
nostalgic admiration of the
ancient lecture theatres becomes
an overwhelming obstacle to
demolition.
The gutting of the theatres is
planned to occur soon after
students leave at the end of this
term with demolition projected,
barring complications, for
September.
(NUS continues from page one)
did leave the option of objecting
later open, saying 'maybe I will',
but stressed that "the people
running the referendum should
be doing something about it."
The competency of the I C U
Executive's r u n n i n g of the
referendum is crucial to the
legitimacy of the ballot. If the
next I C U Council meeting on
the 23rd May decides that their
handling of the issue has not
been acceptable, the whole
exercise will be discounted. M s
Thomas refused to disclose her
opinions of Exec's management
of the referendum, saying that
she would take any objections to
them, rather than commenting
to F E L I X .
While it had been suspected
that turnout might not reach the
required one thousand votes, it
now appears that the four days of
balloting across campus could
mean that sufficient numbers of
students will vote for the count
to be quorate. As F E L I X went
to press, after two days' voting,
insiders estimated that between
six and seven hundred votes had
been cast. If another four
hundred students express their
opinions before 7.00pm today a
legitimate decision w i l l have
been made.
It is still not clear whether
Claire Maloney, St Mary's
Student U n i o n President, will
encourage medical students to
vote. Guidance by St Mary's
Student U n i o n i n the recent
sabbatical elections resulted i n
over two hundred extra medical
votes for the preferred
candidates. Clearly this could
have a significant impact on the
NUS referendum, but, with M s
Maloney said to be annoyed that
Paddington students were not
mailed the information given to
South Kensington students, it is
possible that very few votes will
come from the northern part of
the campus.
It has also emerged that last
Friday's Referendum Hustings
were even more confused than
first thought. J i m M u r p h y ,
recently re-elected for a second
year as N U S President, arrived
late expecting to speak on behalf
of the pro-lobby. I C U and the
N U S are still at odds as to why
the delegation was late with both
parties blaming each other.
Funds Promised (Perhaps?)
