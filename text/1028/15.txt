London University Squash Leagues
The London University Squash Leagues are run during the
autumn and spring terms. Forty-five teams from eighteen
different universities compete in the five divisions. This year
Imperial College's five teams have achieved some of the best
results ever seen by one university.
The first team won Division 1 and claimed the league
trophy whilst the fourth and fifth teams won Division 3 and 4
respectively. The third team's second place in Division 2
secures their promotion to Division 1, joining the first and
second teams for the next season.
Congratulations to all those who played for the college,
especially the team captains for all their time spent organising
the matches.
The full results are on the Squash Club notice board, as are
details of the committee positions available for next year.
Editorial <§
As you may have spotted, we have an abundance of reports this
week, but I just about managed to cram them in! More
seriously folks, I tire of spontaneously constructing editorials
from thin air so - gasp! - 1 will be presenting a guide to strange
and different sports starting from next week (as we DoC
students don't have much to do for the rest of term). Any sports
reports received will, of course, be published!
Mark.
