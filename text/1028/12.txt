'They tried and failed?' questioned Magpie. 'No. They tried
and died' returns the sorry response. Yes it's dune on video.
'Dune, desert planet...' he continues. Yes, yes, very good but
I bet you can't do the parrot sketch?
Lots to do, no time to waste - tintin on cornershop's new
album, Stylus on offspring, Bratt Anderson on pet lamb and
Nick on marion; those last three all live and kicking.
Samin wandered lonely as a columnist trying to satisfy the
summer requirements of a demonic standby editor desperate
to fill space. Unlike Wordsworth, Samin found 'his bit' of
London. Read it in the column that refuses to die
Jenny Ho on the Cantona that is i.d., Magpie shoots from the
little Jewish director with bullets over broadway and tintin
sheds tears over the fate of the steal - they are your film
team. Listen and obey.
Cheeky chappies, Jeremy Thomson, Matt Booth and Ali
O'Shay, produce mayhem and confusion in equal measures.
They are this week's happy rotation crew. Take it away...

Originally released in 1984 - to
less than universal praise - the
David Lynch directed d u n e is a
stunning science fiction film. In
part this is due to its strong visual
flair; for example the architecture
and props are less Star Wars and
more early Flash Gordon with a
dash of Dalian surrealism.
However Lynch also has a totally
unique view of Frank Herbert's
original book, and with these
elements combined he manages
to create over two hours of
compelling viewing.
You have watch it several
times to fully understand the
complex plot though. David
Lynch's imagination often jumps
from one idea to the next in an
attempt convey all the background
information, which leaves the
viewer somewhat baffled.
Although Dune may have
many intertwined themes, the
underlining plot involves the
intergalactic politics of the Padisha
Emperor, as he forces the House
of Atreides to move to a desert
planet called Arrakis or Dune. The
planet's importance is that it's the
only place where the spice,
melange which allows travel
through space and time, is found.
Whoever controls the spice
production, controls the universe.
When originally released
Dune was hounded by the critics
and flopped at the cinema, but
with the passing of time, it's
become an undeniable cult classic.
Having it on video is a definite
advantage to understanding it too.

With a title like woman's gotta have
it, you might think that nothing's
changed down cornershop way.
Wrong. Their fourth album sees a
welcome move towards the trancey
eastern twirls which have gained
Tjinder Singh such acclaim with side
project, Clinton.
There's something of the old
agit pop on display though; tracks
like 'call all destroyer' and 'hong
kong book of kung fu' still punch
their weight. However, it's delights
like 'roof rack', with its floating lead
guitar, and the eight minute roving
drum trip-out of 'looking for the way
in', that really carry your ear with
hop skip and jump. And whilst there
are the odd papered-together
cracks, overall Cornershop appear
to be heading towards a surprisingly
tuneful horizon. (7)
They may look like Pavement
but quicksand they snarl and the
lead singer has an aversion to
melody. It's fast industrial punk-
metal, only they seem to have
ignored the last ten years
progression in both those genres to
produce a very dull sound. The
nasty looking skins lap it up though;
the bald row of heads nodding like
some fleshy executive toy, but there
was nothing there.
So to the offspring. They take
to the stage and the crowd go
absolutely mental. The mosh is
enormous, everyone sings all the
words, twenty girls to my left pick up
where Riot Grrl went wrong and
spill their own blood away from the
bullies at the front and I admit I'm
carried away with the enthusiasm.

But their second song sounds like
their first, which isn't much different
to the third.
Still, the performance is great
and involves a singing vocal
audition, an audience demanded
snog between two strangers and a
thirty strong mass stagedive! But
'self-esteem', together with
Weezer's 'sweater song' stand out
embarrassingly from the rest.
It's telling that they encore with
Nirvana's 'territorial pissings' and
already the song seems an historical
relic. As the new kids on the
territory arrive, we're into our
second generation of popular
'alternative' bands. Unfortunately
the standard is already falling.
pet lamb are kind of hard to
make out. It's not because they're
on another plane being unique, it's
more they're doing their own thing
and anything worth something has
some sort of individuality.
The Irish quartet open like they
mean to go on with 'the bast*d', a
word that crops up with such
frequency in tonight's set you
wonder they they know anyone they
actually like. Anyhow they go on
and upwards in their pop/hardcore
breeding quest. Their last single,
'where did your plans go?' and the
all out trash attack of 'insult to
injury' were just two excellent
examples of a band torturing a
skewed tune with violent noise.
They finished with a(n in)tense
'never rest again'. Its catchy refrain;
"and I will kill you in the end, cos
you will never rest again" combined
with a melody to die for. I'm sure
the band would be happy to oblige.
'Get there for the doors', said
Vik. I realised my mistake as
puressence completed their set
within the first 10 minutes of me
arriving. From what I could tell they
appeared to have it together -
congratulations to the sound man
who produced a well defined sound.
As for the band? Well they could
have been Gene on a bad day.
After a pleasingly short break
m a r i o n appeared and blew the
support away; both musically and in
the volume sense. They kicked off
with 'falling through'; full of energy
and power followed by 'moving
fast'. Towards the end, Marion
appeared to loose the plot a little
but then pulled their gem of a debut
single, 'sleep', out of the fire.
Following tumultuous applause they
returned for a encore that consisted
of the most impressive track yet:
'father's day'. 0
