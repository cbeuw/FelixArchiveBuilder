It took me a long time to think of a
bit of London that, well, repre-
sented my London. Then I
remembered the canal.
The canal moves from A to B,
from Camden Town to Kings
Cross, from one part of London to
another. The A and B could only
be London places. The canal, the
route, could only be a London
canal. Once proud, a useful part
of the city, now the dirty water just
reflects the grime of the structures
around it.
Camden Town itself is a
peculiar place. It's "trendy" I
suppose. I use the word in quotes
because Camden Town is
considered, thought, known, to be
trendy. Yes, there are the clubs,
cafes, bars. But because it's
considered to be trendy the
tourists - the young Japanese -
descend. In a way the Market is
the symbol of the Town, of London
Town. You can buy and sell
anything there.
It takes several twists and
turns along the canal to get away
from Camden Town. You see the
last bit of the designer Sainsbury's.
You walk along and the new signs
inform you that the waterway is
now a property of Thames Water
pic or whoever. The canal is dirty.
Bottles, condoms, carrier bags -
the disposables of our age pop
their heads out of the green water.
But there is an alternative
picture of the canal. You have to
look for it. There are house boats,
the wildlife reserve. And on sunny
days couples sit at the edge of the
canal and open a bottle of wine.
The house boats remind me of
Amsterdam. But there the boats
are actually homes. Here they are
shelter for people escaping from
the city, for people who cannot
afford to live in "proper" houses.
Half an hour, forty minutes
later, you get to Kings Cross. Kings
Cross, the exit to the North. Kings
Cross, famous for boy prostitutes
and drug addicts. The once-proud
railway station is neglected and
grimy. Islington, a sign says, lies
half a mile away. A h , English
civilisation is within reach. The
contrast to the start of my journey
is sharp: Camden Town is full of
shops, the hustle and bustle of a
souk; Kings Cross is dead, nothing
more than an intersection. From
where I stand now I can see the
new British Library building
struggling to rise.
This is our Pergau. A sign of
our times; of money-gobbling
initiatives that benefit only the
elite pass holders. O
In i . d . , four policemen go
undercover at a London football
club to investigate hooliganism.
Assuming the identities of football
thugs, they attempt to get close
enough to the ringleaders to put
them away. However, the football
and hooliganism merely act as a
background to a psychological
drama which follows the decline
into violence of one of their
number, John.
Going undercover changes
John (Reece Dinsdale); he finds that
he cannot help enjoying the
violence which occurs on the
football terraces. Not only that, but
it begins to play a part in his
homelife as well.
Released during a period when
the levels of aggression on the
pitch, as well as on the terraces, are
increasing, i.d. confronts the
monstrosity of football hooliganism.
Still Phi//p Dov/s' directorial debut is
not a film which people will come
out saying they enjoyed, but it's
certainly a film which both engages
and intrigues.
It's undeniable. Woody Allen is
back on track with bullets over
Broadway, following his homeside
turmoil and, Oscars aside, it's even
made money!
John Cusak plays David, a New
York playwright, eager to see his
masterpiece on stage. Financial
backing finally comes conditionally
from New York's local gangster
boss; the boss wants his girl, Olive
(Meg Tilly], to have a part in the
play. David's dilemma is to direct
the play without offending the
gangland boss. His job is made
even harder thanks to the
continuous script changes forced by
Olive's bodyguard - someone
whose writing talent comes from a
harsh life in the real world.
The exuberance of all the
characters lifts the film from being
'another Woody Allen film' to a
hilariously funny film. Di'anne Wiest
has one of the most memorable
roles; her manipulative charms
have David drooling at every
encounter. She gives him energy
while taking the play and subtly
molding certain parts to prop up
her own aging career.
When the play finally reaches
the stage the change is evident.
David has to face the problem of
whether or not he has betrayed the
art of writing to win success on
Broadway.
If you've never seen a Woody
Allen film before, Bullets over
Broadway is an excellent starting
point.
Well, usual as it may seem, I
feel I'm out on an unusual limb.
Everyone and their blind grand-
mother seems convinced, the steal
is an awful film. Even Barry 'I
wouldn't know a creditable attempt
at the cinematographers' art if it
passed me fifty quid - thanks very
much rise, time to raise eyebrows in
my sexy if demure way' Norman
has given it the proverbial NY
cheer. So why did I find it funny?
M m m m m , probably because I
thought '4w&f was such a fag-end.
With one exception (American
of course), The Steal's cast is fine
and British - heck it's even got
Stephen Fry and Jack Dee in bit
parts! Of course the plot is, in the
main, twee, there's some awful
technobabble and the odd cringe
worthy part, but I'll repeat (for
clarity); in parts this film was very
funny. If you see Outbreak instead
you deserve everything you get. 0

Every artist has their own sound
and to compare them to others is
unfair, it restricts their image not
only to the comparison, but when
two or more similarities are cited,
to the narrow Venn overlap.
Hence Matt Booth and I, Jeremy

wholly independent reviews....
