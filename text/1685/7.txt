T
he group of the
most trafficked
animal is one
that you may
not have even heard of,
the pangolin. There are
eight extant species of
pangolin found across
the Old World in Africa
and south-east Asia;
they relatively unas-
suming animals, they
are also known as scaly
anteaters due to the fact
that they are covered in
hard scales and predate
on ants and termites.
Pangolins essentially
fill the same niche as
the anteaters of the New
World, but due to their
unique scales' they are
the most hunted and
trafficked animal on the
face of the planet. Their
defence mechanism,
when faced with a threat,
is to curl up into a ball and
to let their scales do all
the work. But while this is
great if the adversary is a
big cat, it makes it easier
for poachers to round
developed.
Their scales are used
in traditional Chinese
medicine and, once dried,
it is believed they can be
used to alleviate a number
of symptoms. The scales
are made of keratin – the
same material as our hair
and nails – but there is no
scientific evidence that
there is any benefit of
their use. As a result of the
high demand of pangolin
scales, they can sell on
the black market for over
$3,000 a kilogram. They
are also traded for their
meat, which is a delicacy
in some cultures. To
supply a growing market
in Asia, it is estimated that
up to 100,000 pangolins
are captured every year
from across Africa and
Asia, with most being
shipped and sold in China
and Vietnam.
In 2016, all eight
species of pangolin were
given CITES Appendix I
listing – the highest level
of international legal pro-
tection – to help combat
the illegal trade of the
animals. However, these
measure may have come a
little too late for the four
Asian species which have
unfortunately been deci-
mated by illegal poaching.
Part of the problem stems
from the fact that pango-
lins breed slowly meaning
the population takes time
to recover. This interna-
tional protection may be
a step forward in the right
direction, but as with all
illegal trade (such as that
in ivory and rhino horns),
criminal organisations
always find ways around
the legislation. It has
become increasingly clear
that as the Asian species
have declined, their
African counterparts are
now being targeted more
heavily. Enforcement of
the legislation and coop-
eration from all parties is
needed if we are going to
work together to prevent
the extinction of one of
the most unusual groups
of mammals.

Crossing the blood-brain barrier: the final frontier

ene therapy
serves as a
means to intro-
duce artificial
DNA into cells, which can
then be transcribed and
translated into proteins
in order to treat various
medical conditions.
However, there remain
many limitations for
treating medical condi-
tions associated with the
central nervous system.
Gene therapy works by
packaging genes into
specific carriers – often
made from the outer shell
of viruses, and capable
of breaking into cells –
which are then injected
into the bloodstream.
Once they reach and
migrate into cells, they
unload their genetic ma-
terial. However, to reach
the brain the carriers must
cross the highly selective
membrane called the
blood-brain barrier. This
barrier restricts most sub-
stances in the blood from
passing into the brain,
and, consequently, has
rendered many drugs and
therapies ineffective for
use in the brain. A recent
study, however, published
in Molecular Medicine,
examined and identified
potential virus capsid
structures which are able
to cross the blood-brain
barrier, thereby improving
the reach of gene therapy.
This study examined
adeno-associated viruses
(a group of non-patho-
genic viruses) for their
ability to potentially
improve transmission
through the blood-brain
barrier, and to enhance
specificity for brain cells.
Scientists compared the
capsid features of two
type of adenoviruses
which differed by their
ability to pass through the
blood-brain barrier, and
subsequently generated a
library consisting of the
individual parts of the
capsid structure from the
former virus. Using the
library, they swapped out
the corresponding parts
in the capsid of the latter
virus one-by-one. The
result of each individual
swap was noted, and the
parts responsible for the
change in their ability
were identified, with their
properties characterised.
The results of this study
prove useful, since they
show the capability we
have to control movement
through the blood-brain
barrier. This provides the
possibility of developing
novel therapies which
can target the diseases
associated with brain and
spinal cord – such as brain
tumours – which have not
proved an easy target due
to this barrier. The current
strategy involves provid-
ing a high dosage of the
therapy, but this causes
side effects by infecting
non-target cells. By im-
proving the specificity of
crossing the blood-brain
barrier, one can reduce the
dose amounts and also the
cost of therapy.
The study is promis-
ing, but requires further
research to ensure the
robustness for the proof
of concept. As mice were
the subjects of this study,
it is likely that the findings
may not be representative
of human conditions, and
thus the effectiveness
of the study in human
samples needs to be
established. Furthermore,
this study has only ac-
counted for the challenges
associated with crossing
the blood-brain barrier,
but the final gene therapy
might still be limited by
further complications
such as improper dosage
and possible side effects.
Nonetheless, it kindles
hope we may be able to
target the brain-associated
diseases which have for
so long eluded the reach
of medicine.

Work hard, play harder – how playing can improve
STEM subjects
Next time you’re called out for playing video games when you’re meant to be revising, just remember that such
games can improve your spatial reasoning skills.

London is a science,
technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics
(STEM) focused universi-
ty with, sadly, an uneven
male to female ratio.
However, the imbalance
of gender in STEM
subjects is not localised
to Imperial – this trend
can be seen across the
globe. Whilst efforts had
been made to steer more
women into STEM, a new
study in the U.S. may hold
the key to such a problem.
Simply put, the poten-
tial solution is playing
games!
A study involving 345
undergraduate students
showed that spatial skills
are significantly higher
in students who played
action, construction, or
sports video games – the
same skills that are rel-
atively higher in STEM
graduates.
Such statistically sig-
nificant results are unsur-
prising, as STEM subjects
often require visualisation
and interpretation of
graphs, diagrams, and
maps. However, a high
spatial reasoning score
could also be explained
by general intelligence.
In this study, standardised
test scores were used as
a proxy for intelligence.
Furthermore, each spatial
test evaluates a different
aspect of the perception
of spatiality – for instance
mental rotation of objects,
and finding hidden items
in a large pattern.Thus, the
association of intelligence
with STEM subjects can
be minimised.
When inspecting the
data, researchers discov-
ered that females present-
ed with weaker spatial
skills than males overall.
Conversely, after adjust-
ing for the frequency at
which the students played
construction games, the
differences disappeared.
This implies that women
and men are equally good
at spatial reasoning on a
biological level. However,
males tend to have an
increased interest in ac-
tion-based games, thereby
developing better spatial
skills.
Given the results, the
research group suggest-
ed that schools should
introduce more spatial
reasoning training in the
classroom to encourage
students to take up STEM

subjects. Since childhood
play has such an important
role in developing spatial
skills, informal training
such as video games and
construction-based toys,
e.g. Lego, at a young age
could be introduced to
reduce the gender dis-
parities seen with STEM

subjects.
Rest assured, not all
hope is lost for grown-
ups, as adulthood training
can still impact on spatial
training. Not only can
video games or Lego will
help; photography, chess,
and origami can also boost
visual-spatial abilities!
Nonetheless, while
it is common to assume
causality, it is unclear of
the connection of these
events – consequently, we
cannot be entirely certain
that STEM subjects cause
high spatial reasoning, not
vice-versa. Nevertheless,
it is a cheap and relatively
easy implementable inter-
vention that may increase
the number of female and
male students progressing
into STEM subjects. Ad-
ditionally, next time when
you ought to be studying
but are side-tracked by
gaming, you can claim
that you are training your
spatial reasoning to ease
the guilt!
