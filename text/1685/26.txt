ICURFC 2s take the city
W
ith ponchos
p a c k e d ,
sombreros
worn, and
moustaches attempted,
the boys made their way
to their fixture. Fortress
Harlington was the
setting for yet another
league game for the
mighty Imperial Los
Dos Fifteenos. The boys
were greeted with perfect
conditions: a premature
warm-up from the ref
and a late City team (Los
Banditos). An early game
against this side had
proven to be too much
for them to handle, as the
match was postponed –
most likely due to their
fear of facing another 59
– 0 loss at the hands of the
undefeated Imperial side.
Nonetheless, the game
kicked off, and, with
several strong carries,
fresher Sorrell Cowen
proved why he is a prime
poaching target for the
first XV as he sliced
through the defence to bag
the first try of the match.
Several minutes after the
restart, a penalty awarded
deep in the opposition 22
allowed for an exquisite
back’s move straight off
the training paddock to
send Andy Lumb over for
a meat pie. A similar try
was scored just minutes
later, with Andy making
real use of that caterpil-
lar warm-up to squirm
over for his hat-trick
avoidance. However, Los
Banditos did not roll over.
A strong restart, played
deep into the Imperial
22, was taken up by
our very own Matthieu
Jalibert (Gustave Roux
de Bezieux) who sent a
beautiful kick over the
halfway line and straight
into touch – too bad he
had already travelled ten
metres outside of the 22
and had lost Imperial
a dangerous attacking
opportunity. He was
subsequently sent for a
Head Injury Assessment.
Nevertheless, the strong
defensive work displayed
by Imperial proved to be
impenetrable and, a quick
turnover ball – beautiful
structured play interlink-
ing forwards and backs
– sent Vice-Captain Ifan
Dafydd over the white-
wash for two fine tries
putting him in contention
for hat-trick avoidance.
With the points racking up
in quick succession and
the bonus point already
achieved, concentration
dipped ever so slightly,
evidenced by the fact that
‘Questions Beckman?’
managed to sneak over
in the corner after a move
fresh out of Ethos on a
Tuesday morning came to
fruition.
Halftime came and
went with a number of
substitutions, including
Michael Rudman, who
impressed with his
snaky runs followed by
questionable offloads.
However, snaky run of
the day was awarded to
Captain Jack Wheaton
who left a trail of bodies
not dissimilar to that of a
runway in Amsterdam to
score beneath the sticks.
Other notable moments
included Tom Johnston
making a fine break only
not to have the pace to
finish it off (he later attrib-
uted this lack of pace to
his un-aerodynamic-like
lid which is now suspect-
ed missing). Luckily for
him Ifan (who clearly has
some pace) was there in
support to cross over for
his third of the day, how
he didn’t get man of the
match and is not writing
this report right now I
will never know. With
Fraser adding the extras,
the match was coming to
a close. Late on, Sam Ha
made an appearance on to
the pitch, although due to
the absolute dominance
of the Imperial side the
match was called off
early, leaving Sam des-
perate for some action.
After some fine dashing,
he made what can only
be described as the most
dominant tackle ever
made… on a wall. Fine
form. All in all, an excel-
lent outing for the 2nd
XV
with a 50 – 0 win to keep
their undefeated streak
going. Sylvia was sung,
and fiestas were dashed.
Immortals send Cambridge into the relegation zone
T
he Imperial
I m m o r t a l s
capitalized on
their new-found
momentum by punishing
a tired Cambridge team to
a 20-0 defeat, and sending
them into the relegation
zone.
The Imperial Immortals
came out looking strong
with a big turnout for this
game after nearly losing
the last face-off against
the Cambridge Pythons
due to an injury-stricken
team. All players were
rested and hungry for a
second victory against
the Pythons after such a
close call last time the two
teams met.
The game had a slow
start with both offenses
taking heavy penalties and
making unforced errors,
while both defences made
sure to keep the other
team humble. There were
several close calls for
the Immortals in the first
three quarters of play with
running back Song “more
fumbles than MVPs”
Zhai making incredible
yardage and leaving
the Cambridge defence
stunned on many offen-
ton brought about a surge
of vigour and determina-
tion to defend the runway
with hail and snow. As
the hail carried on so did
Ben “no daddy issues”
O’Brien making plays all
the way from our 20-yard
line to the Pythons end
zone (plays which landed
him the offensive MVP
for the game). He sure
picked a good game to
invite his girlfriend to
come down and watch.
With this drive putting the
Immortals 6-0 up, hope
for a Pythons victory was
withering away. As the
quarter continued, another
brilliant drive by the
offense left the immortals
at 1st and goal against the
Pythons. The immortals
capitalised on this with
the O-line led by Dan “4
more years 1 less groin”
Grumberg paving the way
for Ben to score another
touchdown.
As the offense powered
through the fourth quarter
so did the defence. The
Python’soffensecrumbled
under the pressure from
our defensive line with
Deji “0 trainings, 1 girl-
friend, 4 sacs” Adeboye
making great plays against
their quarter back. The
Immortals defence also
saw stellar plays all game
from Ben “new phone
who dis” Retter who
impressed coaches on his
first game appearance,
landing him the defensive
MVP. As the defensive
pressure increased, the
Pythons fumbled the ball
into the end zone for a
late quarter touchdown
by Harry “stop winning
MVPs I’m running out
of bant” Lawrence. Harry
then capitalized on this
defensive play by scoring
the two-point conversion
with the offense on the
same drive. Executions
such as this landed Harry
his 7th Overall MVP of
the season.

As the Immortals
headed into the fourth
quarter with the game tied
up at 0-0, mother Harling-
1st
team unable to finish
T
he Imperial 1st
team travelled
to north London
last Wednesday
to take on UCL’s silly
medics, RUMS. We were
there for revenge, after
losing earlier in the year
to RUMS by just three
points. The match started
with lots of kicking, and
both teams were trying to
play for territory. Quick
hands from Oliver Duffy
allowed Josh Pope to
make a break down the
wing and exert some
attacking pressure on
RUMS. From a scrum
on their five-metre line,
Will Aynsley picked, ran
ten metres sideways, and
scored – 0-5 to Imperial.
This was the strong
start that we needed.
However, RUMS came
back fighting and were
able to score after a couple
of missed tackles, making
the score 5-5. RUMS con-
tinued to attack and made
a line break from a scrum
in our 22, scoring under
the posts. We were now
12-5 down.
Fortunately, Amin
Omarouayache had been
watching the Six Nations
over the weekend and had
been inspired by Jonny
Sexton’s drop goal against
France. Using the skills
he had acquired from
Harry Allingham’s ‘free
lessons’ on kicking, Amin
slotted one over himself.
Unfortunately, we gave
away a penalty in our half
and RUMS capitalised,
making the score 15-8,
just before half time.
The second half was
just as tense as the first.
Our forwards were
dominant and made lots
of yards by mauling the
ball from lineouts (when
the referee allowed us
to anyway). The pack
mauled the ball over the
line and Ali Zaboronsky,
playing in the second row,
nabbed his first try of the
game. Amin added the
extras, meaning we were
now drawing 15-15.
Back defending in our
own half, we were caught
offside and RUMS scored
an easy penalty. Another
massive lineout maul
from our forwards led to
Ali scoring another try.
18-20 to Imperial. I can
only conclude that Ali’s
talents are wasted playing
at number eight. RUMS
were awarded multiple
penalties from people
complaining to the referee
when decisions went
against us, and this killed
a lot of the momentum
we had in the match.
RUMS scored another
penalty and went ahead
by one point. Duffy and
Pope once again linked up
nicely down the wing, and
some beautiful offloads
allowed Duffy to score.
The adulation he received
from his teammates after
scoring unfortunately
gave Duffy some false
confidence, and would
he foolishly later shave
half his head whilst
Fiesta Dashing, wrongly
believing he could pull off
the half-mullet-Skrillex-
hairstyle he now has.
Imperial defended hard
for the last ten minutes
of the game, and RUMS
were relentless in attack.
Poor discipline lead to
easy-target Nathan being
sin binned after an ac-
cumulation of penalties.
RUMS came close to
scoring on a number of
occasions, but our defence
held strong. The clock
went red and RUMS were
in possession of the ball
inside our 22. This was
the last play of the game.
We defended desperately
as RUMS spread the ball
from touchline to touch-
line, but in the end, there
was nothing we could
do to stop them scoring.
They made good use of
their greater numbers and
scored from an overlap out
wide. RUMS kicked the
conversion to make the
final score 28-25. Another
three-point loss. Luckily,
Fiesta Dash was exactly
what the team needed to
mend their broken hearts.
So close, yet so far; Sylvia
remains in hibernation.
