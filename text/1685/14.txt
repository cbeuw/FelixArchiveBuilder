Arts Editor Indira Mallik brings us on a journey of queer literature that forms her ‘rainbow reading list’, as part of
LGBT History Month here in the UK.

A
lengthy reading
list, I think, is
a quintessential
part of the
coming out story of every
bookish queer person.
From tentative forays into
Sarah Waters’s debauched
Victoriana to focused
study of Virginia Woolf’s
fabulously winding sen-
tences, we use books to
try and find ourselves, to
build a roadmap of how to
be in the world.
One of the first queer
books I discovered, and
one that remains one of
my absolute favourites
is Alice Walker’s The
Colour Purple. Spanning
forty years, it tells the
story of Celie, a girl
married off to a man
many years her senior,
who is forced to live a life
of abuse, drudgery, and
quiet desperation. Celie’s
misery is interrupted by
the arrival of Shug Avery,
a glamorous singer who is
the object of Celie’s hus-
band’s affections. Shug
and Celie improbably
begin an affair, marking a
turn in both their fortunes.
In a story otherwise
full of heartbreak, the
relationship between the
women is a bright spark
of joy. Written largely in
the first person in the form
of Celie’s confessional
letters to God, Walker’s
“Maggie
Nelson’s
writing on life
and death sing
on the page
in her The
Argonauts”
“Many of the
best of the
queer canon
have found
critical acclaim
on the big
screen”
ness is incidental to The
Colour Purple, taking a
backseat to the humanist
philosophy that Walker
wants to convey; this is
not the case in Maggie
Nelson’s The Argonauts,
which places the com-
plexities of queer life at
its heart. Part-essay on
queer politics and the pa-
triarchy, and part memoir,
in this magnificent book
Nelson describes the
period in her life where
her partner Harry came
out as trans and began
testosterone treatment. By
examining her struggle
to square her identity as
a lesbian woman with
Harry’s journey, Nelson
explores the confines of a
heteronormative society.
It is a fascinating look at
gender and sexuality and
how little both matter in
the face of individual,
personal attraction. Some
of the most powerful
passages in the book come
later on: as Nelson falls
pregnant after a lengthy
IVF process, Harry’s
mother becomes terminal-
ly ill, and Nelson’s writing
on life and death sings on
the page. Addressed to
Harry throughout, who
appears as the ubiquitous
‘you’, The Argonauts is
an erudite, lyrical, and
deeply moving love letter.
Hailed as a pioneer
of queer literature, and
certainly one of the first
to weave a trans narra-
tive, few novels explore
evolving relationships
and a life in flux with
greater verve than
Virginia Woolf’s Orlando
(which is also incidentally
considered a love letter
– Woolf wrote the novel
with Vita Sackville-West
in mind). Orlando follows
the life of an Elizabethan
courtier born a man who
then wakes up a woman
and goes on to charm her
way through 300 years of
English history. Written
in Woolf’s characteristic
gorgeous, sweeping prose,
Orlando, quite apart from
having a plot filled with
twists, is a joy to read.
Patricia Highsmith is
known for her sparse,
detached writing as much
as Woolf is known for her
generous turn of phrase.
Yet in The Price of Salt,
the book later adapted by
Todd Haynes as the movie
Carol, Highsmith’s arch,
incisive writing is win-
ningly romantic – “happi-
ness was like a green vine
spreading through her,
stretching fine tendrils,
bearing flowers through
her flesh.” It tells the story
of young shop assistant
Therese, and the love that
develops between her and
an older woman, Carol,
whom she encounters by
chance at a department
store. The Price of Salt
is one of the rare breed
of queer novels that ends
happily.
Certainly there is no
such comfort in reading
Christopher Isherwood’s
A Single Man in which
George, a gay Englishman
living in Los Angeles,
struggles with depression
after the death of his
partner. Isherwood’s
prose is heart wrenchingly
poignant in its simplicity:
“think of two people,
living together day after
day... in this small space...
bumping against each
other’s bodies by mistake
or on purpose...in rage or
in love – think what deep
though invisible tracks
they must leave, every-
where, behind them!”
A Single Man became a
film of the same name in
2009, and indeed thanks
to Hollywood many of
the best of the queer
canon have found critical
acclaim on the big screen,
from Annie Proulx’s
short story Brokeback
Mountain, originally pub-
lished in the New Yorker
in 1997, to Sarah Waters’s
Fingersmith, which was
transposed to Korea in
The Handmaiden, all the
way to André Aciman’s
Call Me by Your Name,
hearteningly, queer stories
are becoming more and
more accessible. There
has never been a better
time to discover and fall
in love with LGBTQ
literature.
Christopher Isherwood’s A Single Man was made into a film in 2009 // TWC
novel covers faith, racial
injustice, and the power
of female solidarity.
