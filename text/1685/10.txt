Van Dyck, Rubens, and Raphael from Charles I’s
collection reunited
C
harles I left an
astonishing ar-
tistic legacy as
one of the most
knowledgeable and distin-
guished art patrons in the
history of Europe: “the
greatest amateur of paint-
ings among the princes
of the world”, according
to Rubens. He displayed
little in the way of po-
litical artistry, however,
and the tumultuous times
he lived in caused him to
pay with his life. Soon
after his decapitation, the
hard-acquired objects of
power and wealth in his
collection were dispersed
around the continent.
Now, more than three
centuries later, an ambi-
tious project has reassem-
bled one of the greatest
art collections in history.
Walking through rooms
hung with enormous
tapestries and painted
masterpieces – human
achievements of powerful
and marvellous beauty
and detail – it is difficult
to imagine that such
vast riches were brought
together under the pos-
session of one man, and
yet, they represent only a
fraction of the collection.
The long-gone king
hangs amongst his
Raphaels, Mantegnas, and
Rembrandts, remember-
ing the glorious years of
his ambitious past, but his
belief in his own infalli-
bility is frozen in time by
the genius of Van Dyck.
‘The Supper at
Emmaus’ by Titian is
the work which moved
me most in the gallery.
Jesus has just revealed his
identity to two disciples
after his resurrection; he
sits between them, half
of his face in shadow,
and his gaze goes out to
eternity. The body of the
man on the left is thrown
back in an expression
of astonishment: the
realisation of his fellow
pilgrim’s true identity hits
him with physical force
and he is filled with awe.
But the man on the right
is suddenly filled with
the instinct to venerate;
already his hands are
joined in worship and his
eyes downcast, his own
sense of self cast off by
the spiritual intensity of
the scene.
The most spectacular
rooms are those which
host the monarch’s family
portraits, which are some
of the most iconic of all
British royalty. The royal
couple exchanging tokens
side by side, Henrietta
Maria dressed in the latest
fashion of the day with
her white hand rustling
the fabric of her dress; the
restrained attitudes of the
royal children in their silk
and satin finery... There
history breathes, and past
splendour awakens to
daze modern eyes.
Dukes and court ladies
who once sat for Holbein
find themselves exposed
to the inquisitive looks of
visitors; the light that once
shone in an eye, the curve
of someone’s nose or chin
– the flesh that once was
– is immortalised in two
dimensions by a precise,
almost omniscient, stroke.
In the same darkly lit room
are miniatures, equestrian
statuettes, precious me-
dallions.
Elsewhere, the loose,
swirling brush strokes of
Rubens and Gentileschi
cast an atmosphere of
baroque sensuality into
the room. Enormous
canvases hang bursting
with flesh, draperies and
pearls, the vivid lustres of
the colours delighting in
the parting of anguished
lips or in a lover’s touch.
Throughout his life
Charles believed in the
divine right of kings.
This spiritual belief found
expression in magnifi-
cent displays by court
painters such as Rubens
and Mytens, which at
the same time served
the king’s ambition of
creating an authoritarian,
God-like image of himself
that would be looked upon
with fearful respect. But it
was Van Dyck who served
his patron’s image the
best out of all the others,
and whose portraits say to
you: you are not worthy
of the impassive eyes
which gaze past you in
assurance; the king is too
certain of the order of the
world, and of his place in
it – an expression which is
not easy to forget.
The power of art as
a diplomatic weapon
and the role it played in
Charles’ reign can be
see in representational
paintings such as Rubens’
‘Landscape with St
George and the Dragon’,
where the features of St
Georgearenoneotherthan
those of King Charles, the
saviour of his people. The
painting served to sym-
bolically project Charles’
authority and legitimacy
through the chivalrous
ideals of virtue and
martial prowess, using
the allegory of St George
slaying the dragon.
The exhibition contains
great works by prestig-
ious masters but what is
predominantly striking
is their historical allure
seen through Charles’
reign, whose artistic
legacy remains to impress
us today – all the more
so through Van Dyck’s
deeply psychological
portraits that bring the
personality of the man so
vividly to the present.
Our writer is blown away by the power of the vast riches once owned by the 17th century monarch
