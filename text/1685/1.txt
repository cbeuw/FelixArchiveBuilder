Imperial College Union to support strikes

Imperial College
Union Council largely
voted in favour of a
motion to support
the upcoming strike,
which is due to start
this week.

I
mperial College
Union (ICU)
Council this week
voted to support
the upcoming strike
action being taken by
the University and Col-
lege Union (UCU) over
changes to the pension
scheme.
In a secret ballot, 76%
of Council members in
attendance voted to pass
a paper that called on
“elected representatives of
ICU to support the UCU
position in meetings with
College”, and “dissemi-
nate material publicising
the strike and UCU’s
position on the dispute.”
The paper was raised
by Abhijay Sood, Ac-
ademic Affairs Officer
for the Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU),
and seconded by a number
of representatives across
four constituent unions,
ahead of next week’s
strike action. Members of
UCU have scheduled 14
days of escalating strike
action over a four-week
period, in response to a
dispute with Universities
UK (UUK) over pension
scheme changes.
Currently UUK are
planning a change to the
Universities Superan-
nuation Scheme (USS),
which would take it from
a defined benefit scheme,
in which the employer
pays in contributions up
to a salary of £55,000,
to a defined contribution
scheme, in which the
pension value is linked
to the performance of the
stock market.
Students at Council
raised concerns over the
impact the strike would
have to education, par-
ticularly to exams and
major coursework dead-
lines. They also expressed
concern over potential
tuition fees lost as a result
of the strikes. Sood stated
that there were a number
of things representatives
could do to mitigate the
impact the strikes would
have on major coursework
and exams – a position
stated in the paper. Since
external invigilators are
not part of UCU, exams
scheduled for the strike
period should not be
affected.
The approach to the
strike will depend depart-
ment by department, but
it is likely that teaching
missed would not be
retaught and will be ex-
amined in full. Full sets
of lecture notes should be
made available, however.
Sood stated that Union
representatives should
“ensure no student is dis-
advantaged, in the short or
the long run.”
Members of Council
also cited a number of
cuts to campus services,
suggesting the changes
to the pension scheme
was the latest in a series
of cost-cutting measures.
In a meeting with UCU
earlier this month, College
management conceded
they could afford to con-
tinue the defined benefit
scheme, which would cost
at most 10% of the Col-
lege’s operating surplus.
Last year the College
made a total surplus of
nearly £120 million.
Students in support
of the paper argued the
strikes were necessary
for the long-term sus-
tainability of teaching.
Ariana Sadr-Hashemi,
Mental Health Liberation
Officer, said “a lecturer
who is invested in their
lecturing and gives the
best teaching experience
to their students is not
one who is financially in-
secure.” Stephen Naulls,
Imperial College School
of Medicine Students’
Union (ICSMSU) Welfare
Officer, told Council “I
don’t think anyone who
is sitting here as a Union
representative can contra-
dict the main purpose of
a Union: to collectively
bargain for the betterment
of their members. That
is exactly what the UCU
is doing, and I don’t
think anybody could sit
here and genuinely vote
against that as a Union
representative.”
In total, 24 members
of Council voted for the
paper, six voted against,
and two abstained.
Sood told Felix: “I’m
immensely pleased with
this result, but this is
only the start. The Union
