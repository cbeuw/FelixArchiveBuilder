S
o, it’s that time
of year again and
you are looking
for a little bit of
romance. Roses and choc-
olates are seen in every
shop window, the nights
are cold, and all you really
want are cuddles, kisses
and… rough animalistic
sex. Now the question is,
can you have both? Can
you go from holding hands
and looking lovingly into
each other’s eyes to then
suddenly being pinned
down and slapped by
your partner? When you
start looking at the more
extreme sides of BDSM,
the idea of romance fitting
into that seems less and
less likely. But let’s try
and break it down.
Let’s go for an extreme
example: let’s take a
power play relationship
where one of you takes the
dominant role (dom) and
the other the submissive
(sub). This kind of rela-
tionship can have as little
or as many boundaries as
you like. For a sub dom
pair to work they must
communicate all the time,
telling each other what
they like and what they
don’t; making sure they
are both comfortable with
the more experimental
stuff they are trying.
Now quite a lot of
people think that being a
sub is lazy or weak, but as
a matter of fact it is a very
brave thing to do. To give
yourself completely to
another person needs a lot
of confidence and more
importantly trust. The
trust between a sub dom
pair is very strong and
rightfully so; if you are
going to have someone
tie you down you need to
trust them enough not to
abuse the power you have
given them. This level of
trust is not usually needed
in standard relationship
dynamics, but romance
is all about trusting each
other with your feelings
and emotions so in a way
the trust between a sub
and a dom intensifies the
romantic aspect of the
relationship.
Rough, kinky sex can
involve a lot of things
but one thing that must
happen every single time
is ‘After Care’. When
the sex is done, and the
panting ceases the dom
must then take on the role
of carer, kissing, stroking
and cuddling the sub; this
is what is meant by After
Care. After Care is a way
of showing the sub that
everything the dom had
done to them no matter
how aggressive was
not real, and that it was
just an act. It is there to
reassure both parties that
the sex was enjoyable on
both sides. It lets the sub
feel safe and secure and
allows the dom to be more
affectionate and express
a softer side. After Care
is essentially when the
couple stop being rough
with each other and start
being romantic. This has
to be done every time
rough kinky sex happens
which means the more
kinky sex you have the
more romantic cuddles
you will be having, which
automatically increases
your romance level.
Romance is usually
associated with calm,
slow -paced dates such as
candle lit dinners, making
out under the stars, and
leaving flowers at each
other’s door. Kinky activi-
ties tend to be the opposite
of this, being hard,
energetic and fast-paced.
Sure, candle lit dinners
are romantic – it requires
planning, dressing up and
choosing the best wine.
But suppose you get
turned on by something
a little outside the norm –

“Romantic
and kinky
relationships
are two sides
of the same
coin. They
enhance one
another”
because they know how
much you enjoy it. If that
isn’t love I don’t know
what is!
Romantic and kinky
relationships are opposite
sides of the same coin.
They enhance one
another, both contributing
to the flourishing of your
relationship. Romance
keeps it caring and affec-
tionate while the kinky
part allows you both to
experiment and learn more
about each other bringing
you closer together than
you ever were before.
Romance will always be
needed because everyone
likes to receive roses
every once in a while.
But for me without the
choking, the biting and
the scratching… well then
its all rather boring. So,
my advice would be next
time you want to give
your partner flowers, ask
them if that is what they
really want…

real benefit in taking a break from our shooting-obsessed culture

W
ith the ad-
vancement
of smart-
p h o n e s
and digital photography,
an absurd number of
pictures are taken by
people every single day
– whether for Instagram,
Facebook, or just for
personal collection.
This New Year’s Eve,
I spent the last few hours
of 2017 patiently waiting
for the annual fireworks
display in London. The
fireworks only lasted 15
minutes, and to update my
friends and family I took
one series of burst pictures
and picked one out at the
end. But what I realised is
that a lot of people were
recording videos for the
whole show, as if they
are going to see those
amazing fireworks better
on their 5-inch smart-
phone screens rather than
with their own bare eyes.
It made me realise that all
of us need to reflect more
on our obsession with
photo-taking, instead of
blindly following what
the crowd around us does.
What are the benefits
of reducing the number
of pictures taken, when
digital storage means
we’re completely free to
take more? To answer this
question, let’s look at this
problem from different
perspectives: those of a
traveller, a photographer,
and – most importantly
– someone like me and
you, who merely wants
to record memories in the
form of pictures.
To clarify, my own
definition of a traveller
is someone who chooses
travelling as a lifestyle,
rather than a break from
their normal life routine.
From a traveller’s per-
spective, then, the main
preference is to live in
the moment. To have a
smartphone or camera
standing in between your
eye and the event occur-
ring is to live in a different
world, outside of the real
one. That could mean
something different for
different people, but for
most it’s the social media
world.
Our lives are heavily
interconnected through
social media, especially
with family and friends,
and the boundaries
between the real world
and that of social media
have become heavily
blurred. Once we see
something interesting,
our addiction to ‘share’
it gives us that oxytocin
boost, stimulating that
‘good-feeling’ whenever
we receive a notification,
like, or comment. Why
not take a break from it?
Take a break from social
media for a week, a month
or even a year and expe-
rience the traveller’s ideal
of remaining within the
real world, being mindful,
living in the moment,
whichever term you’d like
to use.
From a photographer’s
perspective, on the
other hand, taking more
pictures is good in the
sense that you’ll have a
better chance of capturing
a good one. However, it’s
actually a limitation that
can allow you to fully
utilise your creativity.
On my last day-trip to
York, I took exactly seven
pictures with my polaroid
camera: I was forced to
‘try out’ the shots first
using my phone camera
and judge the composition
before carefully taking
limited pictures. At the
end, you not only end up
a better photographer, but
the memories also stick as
efforts and thoughts that
were behind those beauti-
ful shots.
still prefer methods such
as sketching or journal
writing to record past
events – when thoughts
are being put into it, the
details are described so
well that if feels like you
are time travelling when
you revisit those works.
All in all, whatever the
perspective we choose,
all of us could gain real
benefits taking a break
from these frantic pho-
to-taking sessions. I hope
next time you’re deciding
to let the convenience
of picture-taking get the
better of you, think about
this article; try and expe-
rience the moment fully
with your senses, look at
the distinct colours of a
rainbow, smell the rain,
touch the wet soil and
listen to the sounds of the
forest.

“Soak it in with
your own eyes.
Experience
the moment
before taking
that picture”
Now, let’s part from
those two extremes and
look from the perspective
of someone who takes
pictures for the sake of
memories. The problem
is not taking pictures,
nor the intention behind
it, but rather the process
of taking them – it’s so
easy and quick, as if the
meaning behind those
pictures was long gone,
and what’s left is a hollow,
digital format photo filled
with colours and lines no
one is familiar with. Let’s
take some time before
taking the image: soak it in
with your own eyes, expe-
rience the moment before
taking that picture. For me
personally, it’s very hard
to indulge in memories
looking at pictures taken
with little effort and time.
That’s why some people
