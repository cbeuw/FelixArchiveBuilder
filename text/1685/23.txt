The ‘A Day in the
Life of Imperial’
video was slammed
as a misleading
representation of

mperial College
London has come
under fire from the
Advertising Stand-
ards Authority (ASA)
this week, after one of
their promotional videos
was labelled ‘mislead-
ing’.
The video, ‘A Day
in the Life of Imperial’,
which was published at
the end of last term, was
described by the ASA as
‘painting a misleading
picture of what it was
like to study at Imperial’.
They have recommended
that Imperial remove the
video as soon as possible.
The two-minute long
video shows an ‘average’
day at Imperial, in a series
of well-choreographed
shots around the South
Kensington campus. It
ends with the message
“the extraordinary every
day”
Julia Kirby, Director of
the ASA, told Hangman:
“The advert released by
Imperial College London
was one of the least rep-
resentative promotional
videos we’ve seen for a
higher education institu-
tion. By making Imperial
seem like a fun and ex-
citing place to study, the
College are instilling false
expectations of glamour
in their applicants, who
will only realise how
soul-emptying Imperial is
when it’s too late. I mean,
what other reason would
Hangman spoke to
Larry Opal, the College’s
Vice Provost (Ministry
of Truth), about the ASA
decision: “naturally we’re
disappointed by the rec-
ommendation made by
the ASA, but we want to
make it clear: advertising
is meant to be aspiration-
al, and we never meant to
imply that this video was
anything other than our
dream of what the College
could look like in the
future. Why else would
there be so few students
in so many of the shots?
Once we ship them all off
to White City we’ll have
the campus to ourselves.”
The College has
informed Hangman that
they intend to place an
addendum at the end of
the video reading “the
persons and events in
this advert are fictitious.
Any similarity to actual
persons, events, or places
is unintentional.”
Students have gener-
ally agreed with the ASA
decision. One student
Hangman spoke to felt
Are curly fries the most extraordinary thing about Imperial? // Imperial/YouTube
where they found so many
students looking happy at
Imperial – I’ve been here
three years and never seen
that.”
Another student
thought the College had
used CGI to make the
campus seem more attrac-
tive: “how else could they
have made Blackett look
like in inviting place to
study, rather than a place
where I regularly consider
whether or not I have the
will to go on living?”
asked Matthew Harding,
a third-year physicist,
“Green screen, innit.”
Harding went on to argue
the video had missed out
on the most important
aspects of College life:
“where the fuck were the
shots of curly fries?”
“Studying at
Imperial is
crushing. Why
else would
people be so
obsessed with
curly fries?”
there be for Imperial
students to be so obsessed
about curly fries all the
time. It’s really fucking
sad.”
“Imperial said
the video was
meant to be
‘aspirational’
and not a
realistic
depiction of
campus”
that the advert was mis-
leading: “I don’t know

Over £13 million was
found in a broom
cupboard in Blackett
by a Computing
fresher.

S
tudents were left
surprised this
week, after an
Imperial under-
graduate found a large
pile of money belonging
to Imperial College
London stashed away in
a broom closet.
Imogen Thibalt, a
first-year Computing
student, was lost in the
Blackett building when
she stumbled upon a pile
of £50 notes, stacked in
piles in a cupboard. She
told campus security,
who investigated the
incident, and found the
money – which totalled
£13.2 million – belonged
to College.
Thibalt told Hangman:
“I was trying to find my
way to one of my lectures,
when I stumbled upon this
room filled with money.
I knew a lot of Imperial
students were fucking
minted, but this seemed a
bit odd, so I got in touch
with security and they
dealt with it from there.”
Andrew Yates, the
College’s Vice Provost
(Where’s the Wonga) told
Hangman: “Ah, yes, that’s
where that all went. We’d
been wondering for quite a
while, and – to tell you the
truth – it was beginning to
get a little embarrassing.
The College would like to
thank the student who re-
turned this money safely
to us, who will receive a
£10 Amazon voucher as a
reward.”
One student Hangman
spoke to seemed surprised
by the find: “I always
thought the College
were saying they had no
money available to fund
things like pensions,
or increasing the space
available for counselling,
so to have this much
just lying around seems
very strange. I’m sure
no matter what happens,
however, the College will
use this money sensibly
and responsibly, investing
back into the student body.
I trust them.”
Yates was evasive
about where the money
would go to: “well, we’re
not quite sure what we
might spend it on yet. A
group of students have put
forward suggestions for
more affordable student
housing, but Imperial
College Union have also
been asking for the funds
for a new desk, and we
need new coffee beans
here in the Blue Cube
Building… we’ll let you
know what we decide.”

Student stumbles upon huge pile of College money
This week you get
referred to senior staff
after someone calls the
Valentine’s Day poem
you wrote them ‘creepy
af’.
This week you’re
the Deputy President
(Education), and the
record number of SACA
nominations means
purchasing mugs has
bankrupted the Union.
Everyone now hates you.
This week you hope
nominating yourself
for a sabbatical
position distracts from
your terminal lack of
personality!
This week you’re Union
Council, and you manage
to get something done.
Finally. Go you!
This week you’re on
a health kick. You
supplement your Union
burrito with sweet potato
fries.
This week you’re loving
the rainy weather, which
means nobody can see
your tears
This week you’re looking
forward for the Union
petition system to get
up and running. Boaty
McBoatface is gonna
make a comeback.
This week you’ve made it
halfway through the year!
Summer never seemed
further away.
This week you decide
to take some time to
appreciate the little things
in life a bit more. You’re
an insufferable wanker.
This week you don’t
turn up to labs, since you
presume they’re cancelled
in the strike. Turns out
your demonstrator isn’t
part of UCU. You get a
third.
This week you’re the
