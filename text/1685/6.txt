College need to come clean with their
investments
The College told Divest Imperial they felt investing money into fossil fuel companies was good
for the environment. They need to take a long, hard look at themselves.
COMMENT
Divest Imperial
Comment Writers
I
t was less than a
year ago that Divest
Imperial was formed,
with previous di-
vestment campaigns at
Imperial having withered
away and been forgotten.
Ten months on, our peti-
tion calling on College to
divest from fossil fuels has
over 1700 signatures, and
Imperial College Union
voted overwhelmingly to
divest their own invest-
ment fund. The stage was
set for a discussion with
College itself – to present
our arguments and learn
why College remains
reluctant to engage with
them – which took place
last month.
In meetings with
previous divestment
campaigns at Imperial
many years ago, the
College claimed to prefer
to engage with companies
as shareholders than to
publicly denounce their
actions. Shareholder en-
gagement seeks to change
companies by voting at
shareholder meetings: the
more shares you have, the
more your vote counts.
In the environmental
movement, it predates
divestment as a tactic by
decades, but has sadly met
with very limited success.
We were surprised that
College chose to pursue
this strategy, and our
instincts proved correct:
in an embarrassing
climb-down, Imperial has
now rejected shareholder
activism, saying that “our
influence is stronger as
one of the world’s great
research universities
rather than a mid-sized
endowment fund”.
So what about divest-
ment, then? A depress-
ingly common misunder-
standing of divestment
is to expect that it will
bankrupt fossil fuel com-
panies overnight. It won’t,
and it isn’t intended to:
after all, shares sold by
Imperial can just as easily
be bought by a third party.
their reckless business
models, standing shoulder
to shoulder with countless
other public institutions in
doing so.
Moreover, given the
frightening scale of
climate change and the
research going on here
to mitigate it, is it even
morally right for a univer-
sity like ours to be gener-
ating income from fossil
fuel extraction? After all,
we already have a policy
preventing direct invest-
ment in tobacco, and quite
rightly too [Ed.: hardly
watertight]; perhaps
College would care to
apply the same logic to
other ethically questiona-
ble investments? Alas, it
seems not. College were
reticent to discuss tobacco
at all, and (comparing the
cases of tobacco and fossil
fuels) said that they “did
not find them similar”,
though refused to explain
why.
With only a bit more
probing, the truth even-
tually emerged: College
“doesn’tthinkit’simmoral
to receive funds” from
these companies, and,
when pressed, revealed
that they believed giving
money to fossil fuel com-
panies was actually a net
positive for the climate.
There we had it, at last –
not that divestment was
idealistic, or financially
unfeasible, or any of the
other diversionary argu-
ments thrown our way
initially. At the heart of it,
Imperial College believe
that the best way to fight
emissions from fossil
fuels…is with more fossil
fuels. We look forward
to College’s imminent
proposal to cure insomnia
with caffeine tablets, and
to hearing how what the
library actually needed
was a few furnaces to
really cool it down.
Fossil fuel companies
want to do is to waste our
own spare time on tactics
that don’t work.
What we heard from
Imperial was quite dif-
ferent. Imperial College,
home of the Grantham
Institute and funder of
world-leading research in
climate science, believes
that we ought to be giving
our money to fossil fuel
companies because of
climate change, not in
spite of it.Though at pains
to stress that it really does
believe in climate change,
the truth is that College is
quite comfortable in the
company of those that
don’t, and ends up funding
the damn thing anyway.
If the choice is between
an honest climate-denier
on the one hand, and
College’s contorted dou-
blethink on the other…
well, with a friend like
this, who needs enemies?
So much for smoke-free Imperial! // Flickr/CECAR
“College said
they believed
giving money
to fossil fuel
companies was
a net positive
for the climate”
will not change voluntari-
ly. No amount of publicity
stunts or toothless pledges
to trim carbon emissions
will change the fact that
fossil fuel companies
are there to extract and
process fossil fuels. Any
serious analysis of the
figures pledged by fossil
fuel companies towards
renewable energy reveals
them for what they are:
cynical marketing ploys,
and nothing more. That’s
how Shell, supposedly
the industry leader in
sustainability (some
achievement), can double
their investments in clean
energy, while in the same
breath invest 5 times as
much in risky deepwater
drilling for new reserves.
Debates over tactics
are one thing. Divestment
seems to us to be the best
and easiest way to effect
change in this area, but
we’re open to other sug-
gestions; the last thing we
The point is exactly what
Imperial recognised – if
we are serious about
making a change, then
our name and reputation
carries far more weight
than any amount of shares
we might own. When a
university with the clout
that Imperial has takes
a stance on something,
people and industry alike
pay attention; when 60
other universities do the
same, it really begins to
turn heads. Changing the
public’s perceptions of
fossil fuels is crucial if
we are to change their
consumption habits, and
divestment is one of the
only tactics that aims
squarely at that target.
Removing investments
from fossil fuels is simply
the means; the end itself
is to afford universities
a chance to call on fossil
fuel companies to change
The state of the Union: to consult or not to
consult…
The Union has a history of making changes without properly consulting with students. If it is
supposed to represent us, it needs to change.

T
hree weeks ago, a
motion to create a
liberation officer
to represent eco-
nomically disadvantaged
students was shot down
at Union Council with a
50/50 vote. The Deputy
President (Welfare) spoke
out vociferously against
the idea, arguing that “it
was setting up a role to
fail” and “the relevant
students haven’t been
consulted”. It was this last
point that I found ironic
coming from a senior
Union official. Time and
time again, those in power
at the Union have shown
that they prefer to act first
and worry about students’
concerns later.
This is exemplified
most strongly by a report
from the DPW to the
TrusteeBoard(theUnion’s
most senior committee),
regarding the Wellbeing
Representation Network
(WBRN) [Ed.: see Felix
1684]. The report states:
“there was not enough
time to consult effectively
with College staff and
students” and “Officer
Trustees were assigned to
lead consultation between
February and June, which
failed because of a lack of
clarity of the network’s
purpose”.
The WBRN idea was
first announced in January
2017, yet the Union felt
it was appropriate to rush
through the biggest ex-
pansion of the rep network
in recent years, aiming
for implementation in
October. No College staff
were consulted ahead of
planning for develop-
ment, and the 17 students
who were consulted in
dedicated sessions were
all existing elected volun-
teers, meaning no normal
students or College staff
had the opportunity to
voice their concerns
before the WBRN was
set in motion. Mental
health and wellbeing are
incredibly sensitive issues
that should be handled
with delicate and careful
planning, yet the Union
rushed this idea to meet a
deadline, akin to bulls in a
china shop.
Departmental staff
were not satisfied with
this either. The report said
“some departments made
requests for changes to
the Network that were not
possible due to the timing
and progress of imple-
mentation”, showing that
at least someone in the
Union understood the
issues associated with
rushing through such a
big change. However,
when students raised
their concerns about the
network with depart-
mental staff, they were
met with antagonism:
“students that opposed
the implementation of
the Network met with
departments before the
Union, which led to biases
and uncertainty from
departmental staff and
discredited the work that
had been completed”. It
is shameful that the Union
could not be bothered to
reach staff before students
took the initiative –
shouldn’t this have been
done before the idea was
even announced? Not one
of these people thought to
delay the implementation
until consultation was
thoroughly complete, and
all concerns addressed.
The report is a damning
indictment of the Union
– it shows that concerns
were ignored due to the
rushed implementation,
that concerned students
were dismissed, and that
the Union did not address
the requests of staff. Most
volunteers who propose
ideas that they are not in
favour of. It isn’t some-
thing that they themselves
feel the need to do.
This isn’t just a one-off
issue. Student consulta-
tion is something that the
Union has failed to do
time and time again. Most
recently, the timetable for
the Leadership Elections
was altered, with the
usual week’s campaigning
period being removed.
Governance Committee
minutes reveal that this
was an idea suggested
by the Union President,
in order to decrease the
stress on candidates,
but ended up being im-
plemented without any
formal input from student
volunteers outside Trustee
Board. While the Presi-
dent had good intentions
when suggesting the
idea, the new timetable
means that voters have
no opportunity to find out
who is running and what
platform each candidate
is running on. The Union
encourages people to vote
as soon as voting opens,
which coincides with
the start of campaigning,
giving an inherent ad-
vantage to those who are
well known on campus.
Just imagine if you were
running for a position
against an existing sab-
batical officer… With this
new election timetable,
you would be decimated
simply because you
weren’t given the chance
to get your name out.
This is yet another drastic
change the Union have
made where students were
not consulted.
Although I have been
critical of the Union in
this article, that’s not to
say that the Union hasn’t
consulted students at
all. Last year, the end of
zero-tolerance deadlines
and the smoking ban were
achieved by consulting
students through online
polls. But consultation
needs to be done on all
the big changesmade and
stances taken by the Union
– after all, the sole purpose
for its existence is to rep-
resent students. The DPW
has given the green light
for consultation regard-
ing the Social Mobility
Officer, and the Union
President is working
with myself to look into
a petitions system on the
Union website. These are
welcome developments
that show a positive
attitude to student engage-
ment; I hope that next
year’s sabbatical officers
take note and realise the
importance of student
voice and input.

importantly, it showed
that the Union does not
care about consulting the
students it claims to repre-
sent. It appears that, to the
minds of the senior Union
officials, consultation is a
task to be given to student
