No Olive Branch for Rojava – what happens
after the Turkish intervention in Syria?
Politics writer Juan Rubio Gorrochategui argues that the conflict in Syria is going to become
more complex and more violent following the Turkish intervention.

W
hile Western
audiences
were being
entertained
by the latest Trump antics
and the recent develop-
ments in the seemingly
interminable process that
is Brexit, the last three
weeks saw the beginning
of a new phase in the
Syrian Civil War. Now
ISIS has lost its territorial
power base and has dis-
appeared as a state entity,
it seems Syria has taken
the place of Rwanda and
Sudan, places ravaged
by misery and death but
soon left in the dustbin of
permanent instability and
chaos. It is a sad fact that
the relative lack of interest
that the war generates in
our media is missing the
big picture, the events that
could have far reaching
implications in history.
And this new phase, trig-
gered by operation Olive
Branch, is one of them.
On the 20th
of January,
the Turkish army and
allied Syrian opposition
militias invaded Efrin
canton, one of the three
autonomous regions that
form the Democratic
Federation of Northern
Syria, colloquially known
as Rojava. To understand
why, we need to go back to
a time before the civil war,
when the Kurdish peoples
were being slaughtered in
the four countries where
they form a significant
minority of the popula-
tion: Turkey, Iran, Iraq,
and Syria. While the
gassing of Kurdish civil-
ians by Saddam Hussein
and the measures taken
against this ethnicity by
the Turkish state (which
I shall expand upon later)
remain in collective
memory as nefarious
actions, the treatment the
Kurds faced by the regime
ofHafezalAssad(fatherof
Bashar) in Syria is almost
universally unknown, if
equally despicable. Imi-
tating the other Ba’athist
dictatorships of the area,
the Syrian state stripped
the Kurds from their na-
tionality, and forced them
to undergo a process of
Arabization that amounted
to sheer cultural genocide.
When in 2011 the Arab
Spring protests reached
Syria, the oppressed
Kurdish minority took
advantage of the general
unrest and seized control
of the areas where it
formed a majority of the
population, as the Syrian
army was recalled to
Damascus to fight in more
important fronts.The main
Kurdish group throughout
the war has been the
People Protection Units
(YPG), an organization
which has an ideology
that combines libertar-
ian socialism, gender
equality, respect for ethnic
minorities, secularism
and green politics. These
ideas set them apart from
every other participant in
the war and indeed from
any other Middle Eastern
entity. It is therefore not
surprising that Rojava
soon came under attack by
the radical Islamist forces
of ISIS, which ended
in total failure for the
latter entity as the YPG,
now organized into a
wider coalition known as
Syrian Democratic Forces
(SDF), launched a suc-
cessful counterattack that
resulted in the liberation
of the bulk of the areas
terrorized by ISIS, includ-
ing the capital of the so
called caliphate, Raqqa, in
2017. The relationship of
Rojava with the other two
main factions of the war,
the islamist Free Syrian
Army (FSA) and the
Syrian Arab Army (SAA,
military branch of the
Assad regime) fluctuates
from periods of conven-
ient alliance to full-out
war. In another sign of
the convoluted mess that
is the Syrian Civil War,
the SDF have received
both American (otherwise
FSA supporting) and
Russian (main Bashar
ally) air support in its
offensive against ISIS. In
the meantime, Rojava has
continued to implement
its policies on the territo-
ries it controls, including
direct democratization,
cooperatives, the banning
of honour killings and
child marriages, manda-
tory women quotas and
integration of the Arab,
Kurdish, Assyrian and
Armenian ethnicities in a
multinational state.
The crucial position
of Syria in the Middle
East map, in the centre
of a region desired by
ambitious powers like
Qatar, Iran and Israel, has
made foreign involvement
a common staple of the
war. Readers with a good
knowledge of geography
have probably noticed
already that northern
Syria shares a long border
with a rising power of its
own kind, Turkey. The
events that have unfolded
in Rojava have set off all
the alarms in Ankara, and
have awoken the anger
of the Turkish dictator,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
It is interesting to
compare the political
evolution of Rojava and
Turkey during the last few
years. While Rojava has
moved towards a society
based on progressive
values, Erdoğan has
used the once legitimate
power he obtained from
the ballot box to create
a Frankenstein monster
of a country, a state
that combines the worst
aspects of Kemalism and
Islamism to persecute
political opponents and
curtail freedoms. Using
the excuse of the 2016
coup attempt, Erdoğan
has cracked down on civil
liberties, jailing teachers,
civil servants and journal-
ists alike, while women’s
rights are increasingly
threatened as the country
is forced to become
less and less secular.
The repression against
the Kurdish minority
in Turkey (estimated to
be around 20% of the
population) has grown as
the government pursues
policies that silence the
Kurdish activists that are
brave enough to raise their
voices against it.
These factors,
combined with a foreign
policy that has been de-
scribed as neo-Ottomanist
(seeking to regain the
influence lost by Turkey
after the disbandment of
the Ottoman Empire a
few years after the end
of the First World War),
explain why the Turkish
army is entering the fields
of Rojava with fire and
fury. Turkey cannot risk
the spread of the Rojava
project to its Kurdish
inhabited areas, and fears
a reactivation of the
Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK), a guerrilla group
that has been waging
war against the Turkish
state for decades and that
shares similar ideologies
to Rojava. Indeed, while
the YPG was born inde-
pendently in Syria, por-
traits of Abdullah ‘Apo’
Öcalan are common in
northern Syria. However,
the one key difference
between both groups is
that while the PKK fights
for a united Kurdistan,
Rojava aspires to become
one of the federal states
that would be set up in a
future, Assad free demo-
cratic Syria.
None of this matters to
Erdoğan. In recent dec-
larations, he has vowed
to expel the Kurdish ter-
rorists from the cantons,
accusing them of collabo-
rating with ISIS. The main
aim of Turkey is the estab-
lishment of a puppet state
over the border, controlled
by military personnel and
ruled along the lines of
Erdoğanist Turkey. Some-
thing similar happened in
Cyprus during the 70s,
and 40 years later Turkish
troops still occupy the
Northern third of the
island. In their advance
through Rojava territory,
the Turkish allied militias
have already carried out
war crimes, including the
mutilation and beheading
of a young Kurdish female
fighter. It is outrageous
that a country that is both
a NATO member and can-
didate state for member-
ship in the EU is allowed
to commit these atrocities.
Western governments
have already turned a
blind eye to the human
rights abuses taking place
in Turkey itself. Don’t
allow them to spread the
terror elsewhere. Write
to your MP, demonstrate,
join organisations like
Amnesty International
that are denouncing this
madness. Because in these
dark times, Rojava needs
your help.

Students need to support the strikes – here’s
what you can do to help
Next week the University and College Union begin their strike over changes to pensions. It’s up
to students to make sure we support them.

A
fter two months
of failed
negotiations,
with university
management proposing
huge cuts to pensions, uni-
versity staff will be taking
the only action available
to them: striking. The staff
walkout will begin next
Thursday, February 22nd
,
and will escalate over a
four-week period.
You might be worried
about the effect this will
have on your education.
You’re right to be; strikes
are disruptive. Rest
assured that this is at the
front of the minds of both
Union volunteers (includ-
ing the authors of this
article) and departmental
staff. In the short term,
we will be working to
minimise the impact on
students’results for exams
and major coursework
that take place during
the strike period. We will
also be looking at ways
of limiting the impact
this will have on end-of-
year exams, such as by
lobbying departments to
amend exam questions.
In spite of these
concerns being at the
forefront of the debate,
last Tuesday the Union
voted overwhelmingly in
support of our staff in this
dispute. While the reasons
behind this decision were
deeply pragmatic, with
the long term interests of
students in focus, it’s no
wonder that students em-
pathise with the staff on
this matter. We too have
been at the rough end of
College cuts – cuts to op-
erating hours, price hikes,
and failure to invest in
underperforming essential
services such as the Coun-
selling service. This sort
of penny-pinching (SCR
Breakfast, anyone?),
which hugely contributes
to Imperial’s poor student
and staff satisfaction
ratings, is done in spite of
a huge annual operating
surplus of around £100
million. So whose side
could we possibly take:
that of College manage-
ment, for whom profit
comes first, or of the staff
members who actually
deliver our education?
The decision of the
Union is a welcome
move, as it adds to the
mounting pressure on
College management to
encourage their national
body to return to negoti-
ations. However, there is
more that students can do.
If, like us, you feel the
staff are being treated
unfairly, that their action
is more than justified,
and that you want to do
more than just send your
#thoughtsandprayers,
here are some concrete
steps you can take.
Talk to your friends
Explain why this action
is taking place [Ed.: See
page 3 of this week’s issue,
as well as issue 1683],
and encourage them to
support the staff position.
Talk to your lecturers
If you can ask them
whether they are taking
part in this action, and
even encourage them
to do so, then that’d be
fantastic. Short of this, it
would be worth convey-
ing that you support their
right to strike, and that
while there are short term
drawbacks, this action is
in the long term interest of
both staff and students. If
you recognise people on
the picket line, make sure
to talk to them.
Join us for a show of
support
Students will be as-
sembling with staff on
the first day of action,
Thursday February 22nd
at 10 am, at the corner
of Imperial College Road
and Exhibition Road (near
the end of the tunnel from
South Kensington station,
and Skempton). For more
details see the Facebook
event at: tiny.cc/stand-
withstaff
of Imperial College and
Exhibition Roads. Please
bear in mind that pickets
are stictly non-violent,
and must adhere to a strin-
gent set of laws.
Write to the Provost
The Provost, James
Stirling, is already receiv-
ing letters from staff, the
UCU, and our Union Pres-
ident on this issue. Help
pile on the pressure by
dropping him an email that
expresses your frustration
and your support for our
staff members. Students
at some other universities
have requested partial
refunds of tuition fees for
the duration of the strike,
which you may wish to
consider. Urge College to
support our staff and get
Universities UK to com-
promise. A letter template
can be found at: www.ucu.
org.uk/studentvoice.
Get your parents/
guardians to write
Letters to the Provost
will be even more im-
pactful coming from
our parents/guardians,
particularly if you have to
pay international fees.
Share this article!
Finally, sharing this
article, either with friends
in person or on social
media, would go a long
way to helping spread the
message. This is a signifi-
cant moment for both staff
and students; let’s make
sure Imperial does its bit.
If you have any queries,
or would like to help out
further, please email rcsu.
