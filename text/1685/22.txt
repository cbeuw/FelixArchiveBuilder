Our last issue featured the story of a group of geologists who completed GR20, the toughest trail in Europe. This
week Georgios Chatzitheoklitos shares more of their unforgettable experiences and the challenges they faced
whilst on the trip.

Day One: Stage 1A
O
n the first day
we began early,
waking up at
5:15am. Kindly
driven to our starting point
in a small town named
Calenzana by our host
from the night before, we
were nervous but eager to
set off. We were all very
silent during that drive,
contemplating what lay
ahead of us.
Setting off at 6:45am,
we quickly climbed up,
reaching our first peak at
10am. Our spirits were
high, and we thought we
were in for an easy day.
But with 1550 metres
of ascent, the next part
of the stage ramped up
the incline, and several
sections of scrambling
followed, with infrequent
assistance from chains.
Upon arriving at our
second peak, the D’Ortu
Di U Piobbu refuge was in
sight, and it proceeded to
taunt us for the next hour
as we contoured our way
around the edge of the
valley towards it. From
the distance, the refuge
appeared to sit impossibly
on the mountainside – as
though perpetually sliding
into the valley far below.
Everything we needed
was on offer. Once we’d
had a bitingly cold shower
followed by a hearty
dinner of mushroom soup
and lentils, we felt more
than ready to sleep. That
is everyone except Harry,
who felt the need to stand
vigilant, wearing nothing
but his underwear as the
freezing mountain air
washed over him. It was
our first evening on the
trail, and we were treated
to a stunning sunset, over-
looking the small village
we’d left behind earlier
that morning.
Day Two: Stage 2B
After a luxurious lie-in,
we awoke to the ringing
of our alarms at 6:30am.
After the girls had finally
got a grip on how to
disassemble their tent,
and we had dealt with the
complex task of hunting
down Georgios, whose
porridge decided to take
all morning to cook, we
were ready for the set-off,
only half an hour later
than planned. Having pre-
viously tackled a day of
relentless climbing, Max
selected a low-level route
for day two not to exert
ourselves too much for
the gruelling days ahead.
The route wound its way
through the forest to the
valley floor, where we
were to ford what we’d
read was a raging torrent.
It turned out to be a dry
river bed, with the trail
having not seen rain in
over four months.
After lunch, we began
the climb up a stony
trail which frequently
opened up onto ledges
with stunning views. The
2712m of pure joy! // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos

Further adventures on the toughest trail in Europe
excitement of crossing a
rather bouncy suspension
bridge was soon mitigated
by a sudden and steep
climb over a bouldery path
through the forest. After
we passed a seemingly
endlessstreamofGermans
as we were climbing the
final hill, suddenly we
saw a helipad jutting off
the mountainside and,
shortly after, the Refuge
de Carozzu, our accom-
modation for the night.
On arrival to the refuge,
we proceeded to finish the
cognac bottle Georgios
had been carrying
with him. One of the
French hikers promptly
commented “Euh, you
English people with your
cognac…” Upon speaking
to the other trekkers, we
were somewhat horrified
to hear about a painful
journey over the top of the
mountain involving many
chains and scrambles,
and were relieved we’d
chosen the lower route on
this occasion.
Day Three: Stage 3
On day three, the
guardian of the refuge told
us a storm was imminent
and recommended that
we had a 6am start for
the hike to Ascu Stagnu.
So we packed up in the
dark and set off with our
head-torches. The 5am
alarms were worth it,
as due to minimal light
pollution we could see the
most stars we had ever
seen, and we caught a full
moon rising between the
peaks we were about to
climb. The day involved
some technical climbs,
and a large fraction of the
860 metre ascent involved
climbing and scrambling
as well as big rock slabs
and chains that we used
to hoist ourselves up. We
made good time on the
way up, stopping only
when we came across a
couple of British hikers
who told us excitedly that
there was signal where
they were stood. Glad
for a break, we took the
opportunity to tell our
families all was well
before plodding onwards
to the top. Here, for the
first time, we met a hiker
walking in the opposite
direction, from south to
north, and eagerly asked
him how his legs were as
he was nearing the end
of his GR20 experience.
His reply was rather
discouraging: “Fucked,
absolutely fucked!”
The descent was just as
steep, if not steeper, than
the ascent – hard on our
knees and slow moving.
But with the entire day
being only 6km in total,
we were at the refuge
before midday and had
all afternoon and evening
to get to know our fellow
hikers from all over
Europe. The storm we’d
been warned about hit in
the evening, just as we
were heading to bed, so
we opted for a dry night in
a refuge dormitory.
Day Four: Rest day
When we woke up at
5am, we were disappoint-
ed to discover that there
was another storm due
and it wouldn’t be wise to
hike that day. Given that
this stage was the one in
which seven hikers were
killed in a thunderstorm
in 2015, we respected the
mountains and stayed at
Ascu Stagnu for another
day, resting our legs. A
military medical vehicle
arrived in the evening
and, at first, we wondered
whether something had
happened to the small
group of hikers that had
ignored the warnings and
headed out anyway. But
shortly after about 80
military personnel poured
into the showers, which
tremendously increased
the time it took the girls
to brush their teeth. We
discovered that they were
Belgian paratroopers
hiking in the Northern
GR20 as part of their
physical training.
Day Five: Stage 4
We were very disap-
pointed to wake up to yet
more rain that morning
but, with a good forecast
for later, we set off at
6am, getting an hour’s
head start on the Belgian
paratroopers. It was a very
miserable ascent: although
we thought the rain would
stop fairly promptly, it
taunted us all the way up,
making the rock slippery
and harder to climb. Fog
descended, obscuring our
view to only ten metres,
and, at the maximum
height of 2607 metres,
we were cold and lost the
feeling in our hands, even
with all our layers on.
At times, we doubted
whether we should be
hiking in these conditions
but just before 11am we
reached the shoulder of
Monte Cinto – the highest
point on the GR20 trail.
We sheltered from the
wind for a quick break,
disappointed that the
clouds were obscuring the
beautiful view that we’d
been promised. However,
we had a stroke of luck:
just before we were about
to start the descent, the
clouds suddenly opened
up, and the scenery was
even more spectacular
than we’d hoped! As the
sun came out, Georgios,
Diane, Carla, and Harry
couldn’t help but be
tempted to summit Monte
Cinto – not strictly a part
of the GR20 trail but an
additional 2-hour excur-
sion that our guidebook
recommended to reach the
highest peak in Corsica.
of us left our bags and
continued climbing up. It
was well worth the extra
climbing! The views from
the summit (2706m) were
truly spectacular, and we
couldn’t help thinking
that this would be the best
moment of the expedition.
We left our mark on the
summit by signing the
book at the top as ‘RSM
miners 2017’and shouting
the RSM chant at the tops
of our voices. We were on
top of the world!
By the time we’d
re-joined the GR20 for
the descent, the Belgian
paratroopers had caught
up, but proved to be rather
unimpressively slow and
caused traffic jams on
the otherwise quiet route
down. So much for them
walking around topless
in camp and showing off
their muscles, which made
our boys feel insecure…
