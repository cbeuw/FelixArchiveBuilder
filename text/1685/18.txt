American Vandal:Adetective mockumentary that goes
beyond dick jokes
AmericanVandal, one of Netflix’s latest offerings, has flown under the radar of many viewers, but it deserves to be
watched for its smart writing, bold narrative, and excellent acting
W
ith so much
TV hitting
our screens
nowadays,
American Vandal will
probably fly under a lot
of radars due to its lack of
big names and its ‘mocku-
mentary’ label. I am here
to convince you that this
show is, without a doubt,
a masterpiece and well
worth a place on the top
of your watchlist.
Essentially, this show
revolves around a single
drawn out dick joke. The
crime centred on this
show is all the teachers’
cars at a high school
being spray painted with
dicks. A troublemaking
student, Dylan Maxwell,
is accused and expelled,
solely based on his past
antics. Two students from
the same high school,
Peter and Sam, begin a
documentary not too long
after to find out the truth
of what really happened.
As this show somewhat
parodies other crime doc-
umentaries like Serial and
Making a Murderer, this
show could have easily
been a dumb comedy,
making fun of the situa-
tion and the documentary
format. Instead, the show
embraces its roots and
goes out of its way to be as
professional and serious
as possible. A saving point
for Dylan is the fact that
the dicks he has drawn in
the past don’t match the
ones from the vandalism.
Even though this sounds
like a stupid argument
on the surface, the show
– or, to be more specific,
Peter and Sam – treats
this as a serious piece of
evidence that helps the
case. Throughout all the
episodes, we’re treated
to in-depth analysis of
unusual and seemingly
dumb pieces of evidence
and to see how they build
towards the bigger picture.
No investigation is
perfect, and Peter and Sam
hit several roadblocks and
dead ends on their way
to find out the truth. But
for every hypothesis and
piece of evidence that’s
investigated, we find out
“We see
the social
dynamics of
the school,
instead of it
being used as
a backdrop”
“The fact that
all the footage
is‘filmed’by
students adds
a layer of
complexity to
the plot”
more and more about
the high school and the
people. We see the social
dynamics of school,
how the teachers are
looked at from the eyes
of the students and other
teachers, and what dirty
secrets people have been
hiding. This makes the
high school environment
feel more involved and
relevant in a unique way,
in stark contrast from
other forms of media
where it is typically used
as a backdrop for other
plotlines.
Another thing unique
about this documentary
is that it is ‘filmed’ by
students of the school.
This adds an extra layer of
complexity as the students
are investigating their own
teachers and their fellow
peers. In a more realistic
depiction to previous
shows in the past, we see
how the documentary
leads to repercussions in
the real world as, amongst
other things, a teacher gets
fired and a relationship is
broken up. Peter and Sam
indulge in a lot of shady
journalism practises like
sharing private conver-
sations and messages, as
well as secretly recording
conversations. To the
show’s credit, we see
them get called out on a
lot of their actions and
directions multiple times.
It’s interesting to see a
documentary affecting the
lives of the creators and
those around them.
This show is even able
to convey a message to
its viewers if you read
between the lines. High
school is ultimately a tur-
bulent and uncertain time
for many. A lot of people
have their futures written
off, solely based on what
a teacher marks down as
well as what the people
around may think of
them. Even though it may
seem like a lot of effort
to prove the innocence
of an already morally
dubious student, it raises
the question of whether
we really can or deserve
to just write people off so
easily. A truly heartening
moment in the series
is when Dylan tries to
turn over a new leaf and
become a model student.
But once he hears what
his teacher and his peers
think of him, he descends
back into his old antics,
venting his frustration and
wondering whether it’d be
easier to just be the delin-
quent everyone assumes
he already is.
It’s not just the quality
and production level of
the show which is so
high, but also the skill and
performance of the actors.
Even though most are
relatively small-scale or
unknown, they are all able
to give very powerful and
believable performances.
One highlight for me was
when Dylan’s girlfriend
was being grilled on
where exactly she was
during the vandalism. She
says no lines while being
questioned but the way
the actress’ expressions
change and her eyes well
up is comparable to any
emotionally-intense scene
in Hollywood today.
American Vandal is
exceptionally intense and
addictive. As the investi-
gation proceeds forward
in both the most serious
and ludicrous ways, you’ll
find yourself invested in
everyone’s lives, appreci-
ating all the big and small
moments the show has to
offer. At the end of the
day, it provides an earnest
and emotional look at
high school through the
eyes of someone written
off as a joke.
American Vandal is
available on Netflix now.
