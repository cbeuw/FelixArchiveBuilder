.30am, 3rd
February: The
alarm went
off, and twelve
sleepy Imperial sailors
crammed into a minibus
for the journey to the
BUCS South-Central
regional qualifiers held
at Spinnaker Lake,
Southampton. Three hours
later, 20 teams began the
battle to determine who
would progress through
to the national finals.
With only the top four
teams qualifying straight
through – and the teams
in 5th
-7th
going to the next
heat (playoffs) –, the com-
petition was fierce, and
the tense atmosphere was
exacerbated by each team
sizing up their opposition.
Armed with stage
make up, the Imperial
Blue and White teams
daubed on their war paint
in the respective colours
(despite the judgement
of the other universities
present) and prepared to
sail to victory. The wind
conditions were initially
shifty, with postponement
“The tense

regionals in the snow!
Imperial Blue finished the
day with five wins out of
six, and Imperial White
won one out of five.
True to the Imperial
work ethic, the teams
ventured out to spoons
but followed it up by…
settling down to work.
Such was Cobi’s dedi-
cation to work that he
cracked out his laptop to
work during the day whilst
waiting for the next races!
Shoutout to the 1st year
Biomedical Engineering
lecturer who set a maths
question hard enough to
stump the Aero tutors…
8.30am: Races began
swiftly in cut down sails,
with the wind forecasted
to build throughout the
day. The determination
of the race committee
paid off as 106 races were
completed, bringing the
total up to 160. The wind
was incredibly shifty but
everyone gritted their
teeth and grimly continued
on. As the teams racked
up multiple wins, they
began the calculations to
determine whether or not
they would qualify. The
tension began to build
upon the discovery that
everyone had lost at least
two races.
Oliver who capsized
(again), dropping his
crew in the drink, but
valiantly remained bone
dry himself.
IC Blue (Helms: Joe
Burgin, Gabriel Ing, Felix
Crowther; Crews: Calvin
Chan, Caroline Boule,
Krystal Law) successfully
won 14 out of 16 races
and qualified in first place
with the lowest overall
points. Congratulations to
the other teams that also
qualified: Southampton
Red, Southampton Green
and Oxford Blue. We wish
them all the best of luck
at the finals, to be held in
Glasgow over the Easter
holidays. Huge thanks to
race officers Ella Stoggall
and Martin Smethers,
their team of Solent-Uni-
versity volunteers and
the umpires for running a
great event. Thanks also
goes to Southampton’s
Peter Ballantine who gra-
ciously hosted our teams
for the weekend.

in every region due to the
lack of wind. However,
poor weather did not deter
the tenacious race com-
mittee, who managed to
get through 54 races in the
rain. Special mention to
the teams in the Northern
region who had to face
Joe Burgin and Calvin Chan working hard to help Imperial Blue achieve a first place
finish. // ICSC
