A paper proposing the
establishment of a
Union petition system
passed at Council,
among other papers.

I
mperial College
Union will start
looking into creat-
ing an online peti-
tion system, following
the success of a paper
at this week’s Union
Council meeting.
The paper, which
was proposed by Ansh
Bhatnagar, Undergraduate
Ordinary Member for
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences, was raised
following a number of
popular petitions relating
to Imperial issues that had
been opened this year on
other platforms.
The paper argued
that, while such petitions

his year’s Stu-
dent Academic
Choice Awards
(SACAs) have
received the highest
number of nominations
since their inception.
Imperial College
Union, who organise
the SACAs, received
1868 nominations for
the awards, across a
SACAs see record-breaking number of nominations
range of areas. The
previous highest number
of nominations was 831,
which was achieved last
academic year. In total
935 staff members were
nominated, including
support staff, tutors, and
lecturers – again, the
highest number in the
award’s five year history.
This year saw a shift
in the strategy used to
communicate the SACAs
nominations process, with
the campaign shortened to
a three week period, fol-
lowing a ‘soft launch’ at
the end of last term. Nick
Burstow, Deputy Presi-
dent (Education), who is
responsible for the award
process, also worked
with constituent unions
(CUs) on communicating
the nominations to
students, with increased
involvement from the
Faculty of Medicine. The
nominations process was
also simplified, to reduce
the time it took to submit
nominations.
Michael Edwards,
President of the Royal
College of Science Union
(RCSU), told Felix:
“Nick’s new grassroots
method of achieving this
excellent batch of SACAs
submissions is to be
applauded, and hopefully
this signifies a major
change in the way that
Officer Trustees and staff
engage critically with
Union volunteers.”
Claudia Caravello,
President of City and
Guilds College Union,
told Felix: “I think it
was great to get the CUs
involved, asking them to
help advertise and also
put in their weekly emails.
I think that the Union
would benefit greatly in
actively asking us for help
on more things, which in
turn would strengthen the
links between CUs and
ICU.”
The Union has targeted
1000 nominations for the
past few years, but has
always fallen short of
this target. Burstow told
Felix: “The SACAs give
our students the chance
to recognise and reward
excellence among College
staff. This huge number of
SACAs nominations re-
flects just how much stu-
dents value excellent staff,
and allows our students to
showcase this excellence
to the College.”
This is the sixth cycle
of the SACAs. Staff can
be nominated across
eight areas, including
Best Supervision, Best
Innovation, and Best
Feedback, among others.
All staff members who
are nominated for an
award will receive a mug,
and shortlisted staff will
attend the prize ceremony
in May.

proposal.
There was not enough
time in Council to discuss
the finer details of what
form such a petition
system would take; Alex
Chippy Compton, ICU
President, will be meeting
with Bhatnagar and other
students to discuss the
overall structure of the
system, and will return to
Council with a proposal
later this academic year.
Bhatnagar told Felix:
“I'm glad to see Council
have approved the
proposal for a petitions
system. The vast majority
of students do not wish to
be involved in the bureau-
cracy of the Union, so a
petitions system that puts
power directly into the
hands of students would
be a powerful tool.”
This academic year
alone has seen a number
of popular petitions relat-
ing to topics at Imperial,
including ones asking to
expand Ethos gym, and
to bring Stella 4% back to
Union bars – something
that was done at the be-
ginning of this term. The
most recent petition is
to stop the closure of St.
Mary’s Swimming Pool
at the end of the academic
year. It has been signed by
more than 2,000 people.
Fintan O’Connor,
Deputy President
(Welfare), told Felix:
“Petitions and campaigns
are growing in number
every year at Imperial,
and a new and accessible
petitions system will only
help channel the energy
and ideas of our members.
We were already thinking
about introducing one
as part of our review of
our democracy and gov-
ernance, and we’re glad
that Union Council has
now thrown their weight
behind the idea.”
A number of other
papers were also dis-
cussed at Union Council.
As well as the petitions
paper, Council passed
papers in support of the
UCU strike, as well as
ones relating to tankard
policy and minuting of
ICU meetings. A paper on
use of Union space was
moved to a future Council
meeting.

The Union has

I
mperial College
Union has apolo-
gised after referring
to the Disabilities
Officer as the ‘Disabled
Officer’ in some of the
Leadership Elections
2018 promotional mate-
rial.
The mistake occurred
across the booklet outlin-
ing the positions students
could run for, adverts
in Issue 1684 of Felix,
and emails sent out to all
students. The Union has
since apologised for “the
inappropriate and unac-
ceptable terminology.”
The Disabilities Officer
is one of eight Liberation
Officer roles that students
can run for in this year’s
Leadership Elections.
Imperial academic believed to have been detained in
Iran
A
n Imperial
academic is
believed to
have been
detailed in Iran for 72
hours last weekend.
Dr Kaveh Madani, a
Reader at the Centre for
Environmental Policy,
was made Deputy Head of
Iran’s Department of En-
vironment last year. There
was confusion over his
whereabouts throughout
last weekend, following
the death of Iranian-Ca-
nadian environmentalist
and academic Professor
Kavous Seyed Emami in
police custody.
On Sunday, Iranian MP
Mahmous Sadeghi posted
on Twitter that Dr Madani
had been one of a number
of environmentalists de-
tailed over the weekend,
who were being held by
intelligence agents associ-
ated with the Islamic Rev-
olutionary Guards Corps..
Dr Madani’s social media
accounts were also sus-
pended.
On Monday, Dr
Madani’s Twitter account
was restored, and he
posted a tweet that
asked for “an end to nar-
row-mindedness”. While
some took this to mean he
had been released, other
sources say Dr Madani is
still under surveillance.
Professor Emami’s
death was ruled as a
suicide by the Iranian
government, but high-
lights increasing tensions
between the Iranian
government and environ-
mentalists, who are often
dual-nationals.
The UN this week
asked the Iranian
government to allow
environmental activists
to work without being
targeted. UN Environ-
ment head, Erik Solheim,
issued a statement saying
“Environmental rights
are human rights, and
we all have an obligation
to protect them. We are
closely following these
cases in Iran, and urge that
the work of environment
defenders – both in Iran
and around the world – be
promoted and respected.”
They “represent the
needs of all students with
disabilities at Imperial,
whether diagnosed or
not, and work to improve
the experience for these
students during their
time at Imperial”. They
work with the College
and the Union to promote
inclusivity and lobby for
increased support.
Hisham Abdel Aty,
the current Disabilities
Officer, told Felix: “The
Disabilities Officer mis-
print in the promotional
material of the leadership
elections shows a com-
plete lack of either care
or understanding from the
Union about the role, and
disabilities in general. Not
only is it offensive, but it
is simply embarrassing
for the Union and those
represented by it, espe-
cially when the purpose
was to promote the role.”
Fintan O’Connor, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Welfare), told Felix:
“We have apologised to
representatives of our dis-
abled community, moved
swiftly to withdraw all
offensive promotional
content, and will tackle
this mistake head on in
communication to our
members. Inclusivity
is one of our four core
values, and to prevent
such errors happening
again, we will be support-
ing staff and officers to
understand the activities
and objectives of our
Liberation & Community
Officers better.”

Russell Group respond
to Office for Students
proposals about
fining universities.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
T
he Russell
Group has
responded to
the Office for
Students’ (OfS) propos-
als to place financial
penalties on universities
that breach registration
conditions.
The Russell Group – a
group of 24 universities in
theUK,includingImperial
College London, who are
‘committed to maintain-
ing the very best research
– cited concerns that “the
proposed maximum mon-
etary penalty [for breach
of conditions] does not
represent a proportionate
response.”
Later this year, OfS
will have the power to
punish institutions that
breach registration con-
ditions, including student
outcomes dipping below
an acceptable baseline
or non-compliance with
statutory regulations.
Under current plans,
universities would either
pay 2% or 5% of “qualify-
ing income”, or £500,000
– whichever is higher. The
Russell Group states that
a 2% charge would equate
to £5.7 million for their
average institution – equal
to tuition fees from 615
students. The 5% charge,
meanwhile, would equate
to £14.3 million – more
than the total annual
spend on access and par-
ticipation for the average
Russell Group university.
of higher education
institutions. By the end
of 2019/20, the average
university is predicted to
only have enough liquid
capital to run for 81 days.
OfS was formed in
January of this year, and
will receive its statutory
powers in April. As well
as financial penalties, it
will be able to suspend
providers that fail to
comply with regulations.
Last December, the
Russell Group responded
to a number of other
proposals from the OfS,
saying plans to have
universities publish
detailed information
on staff earning above
£100,000 per annum “risk
undermining the ability of
institutions to compete in
an international market”.
High-pay at university
has come under increased
scrutiny this year. A
recent investigation by the
University and College
Union (UCU) found that
nearly half of university
vice-chancellors are
involved in setting their
own pay. Alice Gast, Im-
perial’s president, is not
on her own remuneration
committee, but is allowed
to attend their meetings.
“The proposals
may 'affect
course viability
and quality”
In their response, they
argue that such fines could
mean “difficult decisions
would need to be made
about resource allocation
with the potential to
affect course viability and
quality for students.”
They also raised
concerns that fines could
affect the net liquidity
