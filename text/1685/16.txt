Franz Ferdinand take an unprecedented sidestep
Their latest effort brings a host of sonic experimentation and a new, dancier sound from a band that no longer
has anything to prove.
A
l w a y s
A s c e n d i n g
might be Franz
F e r d i n a n d ’s
most technically accom-
plished LP to date. Their
first studio album since
2013, it is the most distinct
evolution of their sound
since 2009’s Tonight.
Driving this is the addi-
tion of two new members
to the band, Julian Corrie
(who has released albums
as Miaoux Miaoux) on
keyboards and backing
vocals, and Dino Bardot
on guitar and backing
vocals. Together they take
the place of co-founder of
the band, Nick McCarthy,
who left in 2016.
On Always Ascending,
Franz Ferdinand take Mc-
Carthy’s replacement as
something of a fresh start
– though that’s not to say
they’ve stopped sounding
like Franz Ferdinand. Like
their previous work, this
is still an indie rock album
whose punchy basslines
and funky rhythm guitar
parts show a clear in-
tention to get listeners
dancing. But Always
Ascending also features
some of the band’s most
inventive songwriting.
Sonically, Corrie’s
meandering and spacey
keyboard parts take a
central role. Elements of
disco and production from
Philippe Zdar (of French
house group Cassius) lend
distinct sound throughout.
Influence from Sparks,
with whom Franz Ferdi-
nand recorded an album in
2015, is especially evident
on tracks such as ‘Lois
Lane’and ‘Huck and Jim’,
which slickly transition
through multiple parts,
from soaring choruses to
aggressively marching
verses. Sifting through the
unconventional structures
on these songs, frontman
“It’s a care-free
approach to
songwriting
that sounds
like the band
is genuinely
enjoying
trying new
things”
Alex Kapranos’ sardonic
lyrics push towards the ri-
diculous (“At the over-30s
singles night it’s bleak”,
“We’re going to America
/ we’re gonna tell them
about the NHS”). It’s an
ambitious and care-free
approach to songwriting
that sounds like the band
is genuinely enjoying
trying new things.
Thatapproachisevident
elsewhere. ‘Lazy Boy’,
perhaps the most typically
Franz Ferdinand track on
the record, grooves to a
10/4 time signature. Many
of the melodies on Always
Ascending were written
using a keyboard that
pushes the player’s fingers
to unanticipated notes.
The title track borrows
from a practice in tradi-
tional Ethiopian music to
have chord progressions
that never return to their
root note but instead con-
stantly evolve. Kapranos
and co. found the sonic
equivalent of this in the
Shepard Tone, an aural
illusion of constantly
increasing pitch (which
you may have heard of
most recently for its use
in Christopher Nolan’s
film Dunkirk for both the
score, and as an influence
on the narrative structure).
The band translate
this idea of ascension
into a meandering chord
progression played over
the Shepard Tone, and
Kapranos’ meta, punning
lyrics “The shepherd
misleads so you think
you’re transcending.” In
this instance, Kapranos
veers dangerously close
to trying too hard to
sound clever, but, as with
several other tracks on the
album, is spared by the
plucky instrumentation
that reminds us that this is
pop, not poetry.
That said, two of the
best tracks on the album,
‘The Academy Award’
and ‘Glimpse of Love’
are those in which the
lyrics’ social commentary
is most astute. The first, a
gentle acoustic ballad that
appears midway through
the album, sees Kapranos
mocking self-obsessed,
social-media culture:
“There’s a camera held in
every hand / The glamour
of applause in every mind
/ but the Academy Award
for good times goes to
you.”
The lyrics to ‘Glimpse
of Love’ juxtapose lines
from tabloid papers’
comments about female
celebrities’ bodies over a
wonderfully retro, catchy
synth riff (“A glimpse of
perfect abs / In a flimsy
floral dress / Shows off
her slender frame / Enjoys
a private stroll”). In doing
so, Kapranos exposes the
predatory nature of such
comments as the product
of a search for some
true emotion, a glimpse
of love: “Love is gonna
come as a photographer.”
Kapranos claims that
the lyrics on this album
emerged from trying to
write from the emotional
state of detailed characters
he created with bassist
Bob Hardy. As he steps
into these personas, he
further plays the character
of frontman, perhaps due
to McCarthy’s absence,
and ventures lower into
his vocal range, in which
he is arguably now more
comfortable, with percep-
tible confidence.
Yet for all that is new
on this album, some of
the best songs are those
in which the band’s
newfound adventurous-
ness is contained. Equally
there are a few tracks
which are somewhat lack-
luster, like ‘Paper Cages’,
‘Finally’ and closer
‘Slow Don’t Kill Me
Slow’. These are not bad
songs, but are the clearest
representation of Always
Ascending’s biggest flaw:
while offering refreshing
song ideas and proving
that they are technically
able to execute them,
Franz Ferdinand fail
to nail the razor-sharp
tightness and ability to
self-edit that made their
earliest material such
great pop-rock. At the
other extreme, the exper-
imentation on this album
is rarely sufficiently seen
through in terms of capti-
vating, thought-provoking
or emotional lyrics. A
number of the cuts on this
record simply feel a little
too drawn out or unre-
markable for it to be truly
excellent. That might not
be as disappointing as
sounds, though, as Always
Ascending remains a solid
album that will add some
of the most interesting
material to Franz Fer-
dinand’s excellent live
back-catalogue.
