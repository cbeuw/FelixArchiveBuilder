Falcon Heavy: looking past a brilliant publicity stunt
“It became
increasingly
unclear why
the world
needed Falcon
Heavy at all”
F
inally. There’s
late, and then
there’s this rocket.
Conceived in
2004, Falcon Heavy was
in the works before I could
ride a bike or reliably spell
the word “rocket”. Sure,
expecting a timely release
from Elon Musk would
be simply ludicrous, but
this is a bit much even
by future-leader-of-Mars’
standards. Why did the
world’s most ambitious
aerospace venture find it
so hard to do little more
than tape three Falcon 9
rockets to each other?
In a presentation
in 2011, Elon Musk
announced the Falcon
Heavy would fly in
2013. But come around
2013 and the world’s
most powerful rocket
seemingly became stuck
being “just six months
away”, staying that way
for nearly five years. As
SpaceX engineers quickly
found out, duct tape just
wasn’t going to do the job.
But gluing two boosters to
a Falcon 9 core wasn’t the
only challenge SpaceX
faced. Each time it
seemed like we’d finally
see the Falcon Heavy fly,
the Falcon 9 team would
bring about a newer,
more powerful version
of the rocket. Back to the
drawing board it was for
the Falcon Heavy then, as
the concept based around
the now-deprecated
Falcon 9 version fell apart
like a Jenga tower.
Rather critically,
though, SpaceX had little
reason to rush with the
Heavy. Throughout its
development, it became
increasingly unclear why
the world needed the
rocket at all. Its lifting
power, while impressive,
wasn’t taking anyone to
Mars anytime soon. In
fact, by 2017 the cheaper
Falcon 9 had nearly
matched the 25,000kg
payload capacity Falcon
Heavy had originally been
designed for. By then,
however, Falcon Heavy
was far enough in its de-
velopment to stick around,
and with upgraded engines
from its little brother had
the power to become a
super-heavy launcher – a
rocket capable of launch-
ing more than 50,000kg to
low earth orbit.
As it rolled out to
Launch Complex 39A
at Cape Canaveral, the
same one Apollo 11 took
off from in 1969, the
Falcon Heavy could carry
up to 63,800kg to low
earth orbit – the mass of
23 elephants or a single
small space station. Yet in
what must be the maddest
display of opulence in
human history, Elon Musk
didn’t choose to launch a
space station or scientific
experiments but rather his
very own midnight cherry
Tesla Roadster. With a
figurine of a man in the
driver’s seat. With a little
model of a Tesla Roadster
on the dashboard and its
very own tiny passenger
in its tiny seat. All while
the convertible’s stereo
played David Bowie’s
‘Space Oddity’ in the one
medium through which
sound can’t travel. Which
wasagreatidea.No,really,
I’m being serious. True to
their original purpose as
ballistic missiles, rockets
go kaboom pretty damn
often, especially the first
time they’re launched. In
fact, the only rocket to
fire this many engines at
once was the Soviet N1
which wasn’t particularly
successful (to put it
mildly). In four launches,
it spectacularly failed four
times, creating the most
powerful non-nuclear
explosion ever registered
in the process.
The odds were against
the Falcon taking flight,
so whatever was going up
that day had to be okay
with going down equally
as quickly should things
go south. Luckily, a Tesla
Roadster was as afforda-
ble as rocket payloads
get, much cheaper than

a satellite or just about
anything else that might
be useful. Expressed in
FiveSixEight’s curly
fries, blowing up a Tesla
Roadster would have cost
Musk only about 50,000
portions of this overrated
snack compared to the
over 300 million plates a
proper satellite is worth.
Incredible as it may sound,
launching a convertible
into space appears to have
been a wise and economi-
cal decision.
Crispy metaphors
aside, the Falcon Heavy
test flight was the perfect
publicity stunt not only
for SpaceX, but space
travel as a whole. The
footage of the entire
launch has seen nearly 20
million views, far more
than any other space-re-
lated video on YouTube.
Even the most sceptical
and ambivalent observers
admit that seeing a car
soaring through space is
just awe-inspiring.
Rather disappointingly,
this launch appears to
have saturated the market
for sports cars in space, so
the Falcon Heavy will now
need to find a different
purpose. Despite count-
less doubts surrounding
its actual usefulness, the
heavy lifter has proven
itself to be pretty capable.
In theory, we should see it
compete with the likes of
the Delta IV Heavy or the
Space Launch System, but
in practice it dominates
both ULA’s and NASA’s
(respectively) entries.
The Delta IV Heavy costs
$435 million per launch
while the SLS is projected
to swallow half a billion
of taxpayers’money every
time it lifts off. No matter
what crunchy treat you
convert that to, it’s just
bloody gluttony. What’s
worse yet, the SLS isn’t
even a real rocket, but
rather just a series of very,
very, very, very expensive
blueprints. An astronom-
ical $18 billion worth of
blueprints to be exact.
With a launch cost of just
$150 million ($90 million
when reused) and double
the Delta IV Heavy’s
shadow of doubt over its
Hawthorne headquarters.
After the launch of the
ZUMA satellite, a piece
of tech so classified
it’s unclear who even
purchased the launch,
speculation arose that the
$1 billion, taxpayer-fund-
ed satellite had been lost
to a failure. No evidence
pointed to SpaceX being at
fault, but a billion dollars
is a billion dollars (or 1.7
billion Cadbury Cream
Eggs if you will) and
even after COO Gwynne
Shotwell and Gen. John
Thompson claimed that
Falcon 9 performed
nominally and the public
was enraged. Due to the
secretive nature of the
mission, the fault could
lie with payload adapter
manufacturer Northrop
Grumman or even no one
at all – ZUMA could be
just fully operational, and
we’d be none the wiser.
Nevertheless, after the
down that was the ZUMA
mission, confidence was
restored with the Falcon
Heavy and it is the press
payload, does the Falcon
Heavy render the above
rockets obsolete? Not
quite. Especially the SLS
is here to stay, its only
purpose being to utilize
spare parts from the Space
Shuttle in an attempt to
convince America that a
fragile, overpriced space-
plane wasn’t a terrible
idea.
Impressive as it may
conference after that very
test flight that featured
a very important quote
from Musk. Commenting
on the successful launch,
the clearly intoxicated
(though that could just be
his normal self) supervil-
lain stated that he is now
confident “that BFR is
really quite workable”.
The BFR, to clarify,
is the real deal. After
the powerful yet limited
stepping stone that is
the Falcon Heavy, it is
the BFR that aspires to
take mankind to Mars.
Its acronym stands for
none other than the “Big
Fucking Rocket” (a refer-
ence to the “Big Fucking
Gun”, a weapon from the
90s videogame Doom), or
as SpaceX’s boring legal
team chose to call it – the
“Big Falcon Rocket”. The
BFR is expected to first
fly next year, with a cargo
flight to Mars expected as
early as 2022. Of course,
these dates are to be taken
with a Big Fucking Pile
of Salt, as it is commonly
known that Musk’s
estimates are given in
Martian years (the con-
version rate to Earth years
is approximately 1.88:1).
When it does finally take
flight, the BFR will be
a fully reusable monster
of a ship with 150 tons
of payload capacity,
thirty-one engines, and a
cabin comparable to that
of an Airbus A380.
With the Falcon
Heavy test flight, we’ve
witnessed without a doubt
the most impressive feat
of engineering in the past
few decades. The fact
that a hypersonic flying
machine split into three
and then landed (well, two
for three on the landings
due to an issue on one of
the boosters) with fantas-
tic precision while taking
an electric car and a sci-fi
spacesuit to the asteroid
belt is hard to take in.
Best of all, if this is just a
preface to the commercial
space age, we’re in for
one hell of a ride.
The BFR is the real deal and aspires to get us to Mars. Also, I’ll eat my hat if it flies in 2019.// SpaceX
