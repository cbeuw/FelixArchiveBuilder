For one, S-Jay should
have drawn clearer lines
between cartoon charac-
ters (“I have a jet”) and
deeper cuts that explore
his personality (“Why’d
I do things that made my
mom cry?”). As an other
example, I found the bars
of “London Town” to be
over-emoted; a slightly
colder and more technical-
ly impressive flow would
hook the listener more
effectively, differentiate
the verse from the chorus,
and have him come across
as less cheesy. How much
do you need to play up a
prolamation of love for
the Tate Britain?
Then again, there are
always rough spots on
the first album. S-Jay has
potential; I’m looking
forward to the sophomore
effort.
New GoGo Penguin: A Humdrum Star is anything but
M
a n c h e s -
t e r - b a s e d
jazztronica
band GoGo
Penguin has made more
jazztronica. The group,
noted especially for
previous efforts Man
Made Object and the
Mercury-nominated v2.0,
have continued to refine
their unique sound on the
latest effort. Not too much
changes in the way of
tone or songwriting; you
can expect to come across
the same break-beats and
arching piano harmonies
present on earlier works.
And yet, the group feels
fresh and progressive;
new rhythmic corners are
explored, new techniques
are exploited, new tones
are produced. And they all
sound fantastic.
The group remains
ridiculously tight. The
track “Transient State”
showcases their incredible
ability to cram into the
pocket as a group, melding
a dynamically-expressive
drumline with a heav-
ily-syncopated double
bass riff and stacks of
glitchy keyboard chords
on top, weaving from idea
to idea with an uncanny
sharpness of purpose and
a next-level virtuosity.
The band pushes
forward with strange new
ideas. “Strid” has some
absolutely wavy double
bass harmonics at the
end - the timbre of which
is unreal. There’s crunchy,
compressed piano on
“Reactor” that hits just the
right spot. On the afore-
mentioned “Transient
State”, there’s a break 4
minutes or so in, where
the (fuzzed) bassline
takes up a single tone in a
polyrhythmic fashion - it
sounds like they’ve drawn
influence from fellow
Manchester act Tesseract
in particular (new album
out in April who up),
and the whole djent
movement as a whole,
which caught me quite by
surprise (djent’s delicious,
y’all). Ideas and themes
from traditional African
drumming to video game
music are explored on this
album, in great detail.
But there is a special
kind of minimalism to
GoGo Penguin compo-
sitions, wherein each
instrument will pick up a
refrain and slowly nurture
it, creating an intricate in-
terplay between each band
member, and through
minute variations builds
incredibly dense harmony
in the no-mans-land
between the performers.
Inclined to be mercurial,
glitches and breaks will
often set a bandmember
off, and the old refrain
is ditched in favor of
something newer, spicier,
sharper. And so the band
propels itself through
piece after piece, stunning
block chords relenting
to the pull of a driving
bassline of squirrly drum
fill, always coherent,
always with harmony as
the foremost goal.
Thenewalbumisafresh
and welcome addition to
the GoGo Penguin dis-
cography, complementing
the previous work with
new ideas and sounds that
do nothing but enhance
the band. See y’all for the
next one, everyone.
Quite literally a wavy album cover. Nice. // Blue Note

21 STEPS FORWARD
An album from one of our own: 21 Steps Forward
O
ur very own
Suraj (of EEE)
has delivered
his freshman
project: 21 Steps Forward,
a retrospective on his life
thus far, expressing an
ambitious and hustling
worldview. And if I can be
quite frank, this album sur-
passed my expectations.
Big-band jazz backings
and honky-tonk piano
funk are the M.O. on
this tape; the samples are
well-picked and translate
quite nicely to the rhythm
section. On top of these fat
beats comes the man, the
myth, the legend himself,
dropping mad bars and
flowing competently.
The production is
on-point throughout the
LP. Suraj is well-mic’d
and the samples fit well
(cop “Caravan” on track
1). There are no glaring
errors; in general, the
album (and S-Jay’s Belfast
accent) sound good.
The album gets close
and personal, and quite
effectively. Track 3 gives
a frank perspective of
S-Jay’s youth, identifying
faults in his younger self
and earnestly analyzing
them from the perspective
of his present (perhaps
newfound) maturity.
Though perhaps lost
in the verse, there is
a discernible sense of
pathos imparted by these
few well-executed bars.
S-Jay executes enough
well to hook the listener
effectively, showing off a
budding musicality with a
neat bar here and a clever
production trick there.
There are rough
patches, though. While
the flows are generally
good, there’s the occa-
sional stray syllable,
trying to work its way
into the beat and missing.
Though S-Jay covers
pretty nicely, they still
feel extra. In general, the
flow (while competent)
is not quite to the level of
technicality that success
in the rap game requires
- a more precise control
over the flow and the
emoting alongside. To be
honest, S-Jay sounds a bit
like Will Smith, fostering
an outlook that prioritizes
idealist positivity over a
more ruminating perspec-
tive that interacts with
his character and actions
in a more teleologically
nuanced way. That is, he
sounds cheesy sometimes.
Don’t take the steps there bub, it’s dangerous. // S-Jay
Left my heart in Hackney, down in the Peach Pit
A
fter the release
of their LP
Being So
Normal, the
Vancouver-bred indie pop
band Peach Pit embarked
on a European tour early
this year. With several
dates around the country,
the glitzy nightspot in the
heart of Hackney, Moth
Club, was their London
pit stop of choice.
Opening up for them was
a three-piece, Blackaby,
rumoured to have per-
formed live only once
before their appearance
as Peach Pit’s supporting
act. Fronted by William
Blackaby, the band’s
haunting, whispery, Elliot
Smith-stained sound of
their first hit track ‘My
Paula’ transfixed the teen
crowd and induced a mass
hipster head bob across
the entire venue. The set
continued with ‘Hairstyle’
and ‘Pinky’ (originally
titled ‘Punky’, before it
was inevitably autocor-
rected in the lead singer’s
phone notes) being the
prime crowd-pleasers.
When the opening act
came to a close, each of
the Peach Pit members
filed out in quick suc-
cession and began to set
up their equipment. A
short, profound, silence
pervaded the room as
vocalist Neil Smith tuned
the final string on his
guitar before kicking off
the show with the album’s
opening track ‘Drop
the Guillotine’. Written
about Smith’s much better
looking high school best
friend metaphorically
slitting his throat with a
guillotine when stealing
Smith’s crushes, the track
is characterised by soft,
lazy vocals and intricate
guitar licks, creating a
timeless retro pop sound
with a hint of classic rock.
Like ‘Drop the Guillo-
tine’, most tracks on the
album revolve around
teenage angst, the feeling
of which was unintention-
ally intensified by the 80s
prom décor on the Moth
Club stage.
The self-titled infamous
track ‘Peach Pit’followed,
sending the crowd back
into trance which, ev-
idently, only lifted on
the journey back home.
The chewed bubble-gum
pop sound, as the band
put it, continued with
the lyrically blunt and
groovy ‘Techno Show’,
Greek imagery infused
‘Alrighty Aphrodite’,
mellow ‘Tommy’s Party’
and ‘Private Presley’,
after which everyone
grew withdrawn and
introspective. They closed
the show with a rendition
of Chuck Berry’s ‘Johnny
B. Goode’ to reenergise
and pump up the crowd.
The boys were so
genuine and down-to-
earth, staying back after
the show to greet, have
a chat and take photos
with fans. From a failed
attempt at crowd surfing
by guitarist Christopher
Vanderkooy, to the con-
versation and kiss I shared
with bassist Peter Wilton,
I had an unforgettable
time and I am excited to
follow all that Peach Pit
has in store.
An album from the entire London jazz community
A
whole scene
captured in a
brief moment,
Brownswood
Recordings’ ‘We Out
Here’ showcases the
best of London’s young,
growing jazz movement.
Crossing the sounds of
hip hop, jazz, neo soul,
and afrobeat (and even
slight acid house vibes on
Moses Boyd’s track), this
album brings together a
carefully curated collec-
tion of diverse sounds,
with an underlying
‘London-ness’ inherent
across all of them. Within
only three days of record-
ing, Shabaka Hutchings
(musical director for the
project) was able to put
a spotlight on the musi-
cians that are driving this
scene, capturing perfectly
this pivotal time for the
musicians as artists.
The album opens
with a dark, melancholy
rumble on piano joined
by bass-clarinet and flute
to form a harmonically
empty, slow moving build
into a beautiful cacophony
of horns and percussion,
with heavy, impacting
cadences thrown in also.
This piece sets the tone for
the album; a mysterious
introduction to an eclectic
yet harmonious collection
of songs.
The next tune, ‘Pure
Shade’ by Ezra Col-
lective, draws heavily
on afrobeat influence,
although without the
same sort of anguish in its
sound. Introduced by the
mellow tone of the keys
and soft-spoken voice of
horns, the song is set. The
rich, modal harmonies of
the keys provide warmth
amongst the blue horn
melodies and persistent
droning bassline, all
moving independently.
Everything is kept within
the delicate touch of the
drummer, who dictates the
vibe of the song. Halfway
through, these standalone
voices are united, with
everyone moving together
in a subdued fanfare,
Triforce’s ‘Walls’ is in-
troduced by the clean, soft
swells of Mansur Brown’s
guitar (a musician who
you should seriously keep
an eye on), with bass and
keys soon mimicking
after. The guitar then
comes in with an abrasive,
distorted melody ramping
up this almost rock-like
ballad which, after a
thunderous crescendo,
breaks through into a
tranquil, slow groove.
A relaxed, lazy melody
comes in from the synth
with an abrasiveness that
compliments the previous
guitar melody.
Overall, this collec-
tion is possibly the best
description of London’s
jazz scene currently,
and a marker for future
success. Even with great
variation across each
track, this album still
holds a common sound
that’s so indicative of
this movement. ‘We Out
Here’ is an announcement
for these musicians,
showing their ever
growing presence in the
industry, and a statement
to let people know what
jazz is within London’s
culture.
