P
luto, in summary,
is the most vis-
ually impressive
play you’ve likely
never heard of. Before
seeing the show, all I
knew was that it involved
Astro Boy, a character I
vaguely recalled from my
childhood. What I now
know is that my interest
in the ethical questions
underpinning artificial
intelligence has grown
tenfold.
In essence, Pluto
is a sci-fi mystery: the
world’s most powerful
robots are being
murdered, and a detective,
who happens to be a robot
himself, is attempting to
solve the case. The pro-
duction, which is the cul-
mination of seventy years
of sci-fi history, explores
the question of what it is
to be human.
In1951,OsamuTezuka,
a cartoonist working hard
on creating light-hearted
yet meaningful comic
strips in post-war Japan,
created the character of
Captain Atom (later to
become just Atom, aka
Astro Boy): a child-like
robot working for peace.
In 2003, Naoki Urusawa
and Takashi Nagasaki
worked together to write
a new manga, in honour
of Atom’s fictional birth
date, April the 7th 2003.
The story created was
Pluto, which is now
passed on into the hands
of director-choreographer
Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui.
Cherkaoui’s background
in dance and theatre blend
together in Pluto – it is
clearly the work of a mind
skilled at using movement
to represent thought,
emotion, and time. One
of the more striking uses
of dance – and there are
several to choose from
– is the depiction of a
robot’s inner process by
the actions of four or five
dancers around it. When
the detective, Gesicht,
acts out his usual morning
routine, dancers surround-
ing him convey his every
thought with little gestures
which, upon first glance,
appear busy and over-
whelming. Upon further
glances, it becomes clear
that the impeccably timed
hand movements signal
each of Gesicht’s thought
processes as they happen.
Many of the move-
ments of the performers
throughout the show
were blink-and-you’ve-
missed-it, but the one that
affected me the most was
a simple movement of
Gesicht sitting on a chair
and being pushed (by the
dancers) through a white
frame. The simple enough
movement was to signify
his leaving the dressing
room and entering the
dining room where his
wife awaited him. I only
caught the end of the swift
and elegant movement,
and was left with a strong
desire to press rewind to
see the action again. I had
the opportunity later in
the show when the same
action was repeated but,
as I was reading surtitles
at the time, missed it once
again.
Which brings us on to
the defining feature of the
show: surtitles. Used at
times synonymously with
subtitles, surtitles have
a similar meaning: the
translation of the script
is projected for the audi-
ence’s benefit, but do not
include the usual descrip-
tions of sounds that would
be provided for deaf and
hard of hearing audiences.
Pluto was performed
completely in Japanese
by the Bunkamura
Theatre Cocoon, a theatre
company based in Japan,
which meant that the sur-
titles were necessary, and
indeed did become a part
of the show. Rather than
restricting the surtitles to
above or below the action,
the surtitles were project-
ed within the show itself,
adding to the overall effect
of an integrated manga
comic. The two-tiered
stage design constantly
changed shape with the
aid of background dancers
who continuously moved
white blocks and borders.
The surtitles were pro-
jected within the black
spaces created and on the
white borders and blocks,
sometimes alongside
manga illustrations. The
impression intended on
the audience was that of
reading a gigantic comic
book. And it worked.
The downside to sur-
titles, as frequently is the
case with subtitles, is the
opportunity for mistakes.
Occasionally, the words
were displayed too early
or too quickly for the
audience to read but,
given how infrequent the
mistakes were and how
many were possible – the
location of the projections
changed with every other
sentence – the mistakes
were not bad enough to
be irritating. The only
other problem of having
to read a translation was
a general weakness of the
play altogether: the sheer
amount of action to watch
was, at times, a little too
much. Yet, it is impossible
not to be in awe of how
Cherkaoui coordinated
the timing of everything.
Robot puppeteers,
dancers, and minor
characters all worked
seamlessly throughout the
show and it was startling
to realise at the end that it
was a cast of fifteen, not
fifty. Tao Tsuchiya should
be especially praised
for her performance as
both of the lead female
roles, something I hadn’t
realised until I noticed
one of her characters
missing from the curtain
call.
Tsuchiya and the rest
of the Pluto cast were
spectacular, and deserved
far more than a mere four
days in London. With any
luck, they’ll return to our
shores again soon.

Portraits of the Obamas unveiled in Washington
O
n Monday,
portraits of
the former
A m e r i c a n
President Barack Obama,
and the former First
Lady Michelle Obama
were unveiled at the
National Portrait Gallery
in Washington DC. They
were painted by Kehinde
Wiley and Amy Sherald,
who were selected by the
Obamas after interviews
at the White House; they
are the first ever African-
American artists to paint
the presidential portraits.
Wiley has depicted
Obama sitting forward in
a carved wooden chair in
a dark, tie-less suit; he is
frowning, deep in thought.
The space around the
former president is richly
verdant: glossy leaves
lie against a dark field
amongst a scattering of
delicateblooms.Theback-
ground recalls the finely
detailed illuminations on
medieval manuscripts.
The parallels with western
canon are no accident: the
40 year-old New York-
Based artist Kehinde
Wiley is best known for
his large scale paintings
of African-American
subjects, often found on
the streets of Harlem,
in the roles of figures of
power. In one painting for
example, a young black
man is portrayed riding
a rearing horse, golden
cape swirling around
him in a pose lifted from
the 19th
century painting
Napoleon Crossing the
Alps by Jacques-Louis
David.
Before the unveiling,
Barack Obama joked that
he had to dissuade Wiley
from painting him with
a crown, saying “I had
to explain that I’ve got
enough political problems
without you making me
look like Napoleon!”.
For a painting of the
first black president, no
mere allusion to power
is needed, but there are
layers of meaning in
Wiley’s portrait: the
flowers around Obama
detail his heritage:
African blue lilies repre-
sent his Kenyan father,
the jasmine is for Hawaii
where Obama grew up,
and the chrysanthemum,
the official flower of
Chicago, honours the city
where he met Michelle,
and where his political
career started.
Sherald’spaintingofthe
former first lady depicts
her against a periwinkle
blue field in a white gown
by the designer Michelle
Smith. Michelle Obama
praised Sherald’s work
and said she was thinking
of the girls, particularly
the girls of colour, “who
in years ahead will come
to this place and... see an
image of someone who
looks like them hanging
on the wall of this great
American institution.
And I know the kind of
impact that will have on
their lives because I was
one of those girls, and
when I think about those
future generations and
generations past, I think
wow, what an incredible
journey we are on together
in this country.”
The portraits of the
Obamas will remain on
display at the gallery,
where the former presi-
dent’s likeness will join
the ranks of presidential
portraits through the ages,
including that of George
Washington.
A pared-down Carmen falls flat at the ROH
B
arrie Kosky’s
take on Bizet’s
m u c h - l o v e d
Opera, Carmen,
is a confused mash-up of
grand opera and spirited
West End musical. The
director, known for his
wacky, quirky produc-
tions, in his pursuit of a
break from convention
– and in a bid to adopt a
radically postmodern take
on the traditionally heady
romance – discards the
Spanish exoticism that
forms an integral part of
Carmen. What remains
are brief glimpses of
Seville – made apparent
only by Matador uniforms
and Latin frocks in oth-
erwise trite scenes. Even
then, the over-confident,
cabaret-style exhibition
feels brash and tawdry.
The stage, consumed by
a wide staircase, with
stunning lighting, appears
grand and alive. However,
once the initial glamour
fades, the unchanging
concrete staging becomes
heartless, dreary, and
lacklustre. The audience
is asked to imagine the
fountain in the foreground
and the bridge above the
stairs, with no props on
stage.
Czech conductor, Jakub
Hrusa, well known for the
highly acclaimed adapta-
tion of Carmen at Glynde-
bourne in 2015, makes his
Royal Opera debut. His
orchestra brings life and
vigour to the edited score
of Carmen. Nevertheless,
his brilliance can only
carry the production so
far. Towards the end of
the second act, there is
less new music to keep
the audience engaged, and
our attention regretfully
returns to the stage.
Anna Goryachova’s
full-bodiedmezzosoprano
adds edge and a sense
of danger to her sultry
Carmen. First appearing
in a pink toreador outfit,
she captures her audience
instantly. She exudes
sensuality and passion,
adding much needed
strokes of colour to the
otherwise soulless stage.
Despite this, Goryachova
and her co-star Franceso
Meli, playing Don José,
present an unconvincing
relationship sorely lacking
in lust and sexual chemis-
try. Kristina Mkhitaryan
dazzles as Micaëla, Don
José’s other love interest,
with her flawless voice,
although is occasionally
an awkward presence on
stage.
The last scene however,
is refreshingly dramatic.
Carmen’s sumptuous
gown, designed by Katrin
Lea Tag, juxtaposed with
the barren stage, is almost
iconic. Carmen and Don
José finally capture the
passion missing earlier
and although slightly pro-
longed, the finale offers a
taste of what could have
been a remarkable perfor-
mance.
As a whole, the pro-
duction is very stilted,
with an obvious lack of
coherency. A string of
awkwardly transitioning
scenes is brought together
by on off-stage voice that
narrates large chunks
of the narrative, leaving
the audience to fill in the
gaps. Kosky’s Carmen
falls short in almost all
respects, but those willing
to sit through the dross
are rewarded with some
moments of striking
directorial and musical
talent.
