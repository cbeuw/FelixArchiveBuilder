Imperial College
Health Centre could
see the psychotherapy
services on offer cut
by up to 60% later this
year.

I
mperial College
Health Centre
(ICHC) is set to
lose funding for
psychotherapy services
later this year under new
NHS plans.
Under current pro-
posals from the NHS
Central London Clinical
Commissioning Group,
the body responsible for
commissioning health
services, primary care
centres across Westmin-
ster may see their budgets
for psychotherapy cut at
the end of June. Psycho-
therapies would instead
be delivered through a
centralised service, as part
must now follow through
by supporting the UCU
with more than just kind
words, both by putting
pressure on College to
resolve the dispute and in
its communication with
students on this issue.”
Roddy Slorach, a
representative of UCU
who spoke at the Council
meeting, told Felix “I was
very pleased to be invited
to speak on behalf of the
UCU branch. I was made
very welcome, and was
particularly impressed
by the recognition by all
those who contributed
to the discussion that the
UCU has been forced to
ICU supports UCU in upcoming strike over pensions
resort to strike action due
to the hard line taken by
our employers.”
“I emphasised how
far the pension changes
would impact on staff
security and living stand-
ards, and that manage-
ment informed the joint
trade unions that they
could afford to pay addi-
tional contributions, but
have chosen not to. We
are immensely grateful to
the Union Council for so
overwhelmingly agreeing
to support us in out action,
and hope that together
we can help ensure that
management reconsider,
avoiding the disruption
for which we agree they,
and they alone, should be
held responsible.”
The move from Council
comes in the same week a
large number of staff from
the Department of Physics
wrote to Professor James
Stirling, Provost of Impe-
rial, expressing their “pro-
found dismay at the way
in which Imperial College
is handling the proposed
changes to our pension
scheme”. The letter, which
has been signed by nearly
80 staff members – over
half the academic staff
in the department – says
the changes are “a very
shabby reward for the
hard-working academics
who have created the
world-class reputation
Imperial College current-
ly enjoys.”
The letter goes on
to argue the proposed
changes would leave
staff worse off, and
that the changes are
“neither necessary nor
well-motivated.” It urges
management to “stand up
for the Imperial College
staff for whom you are
responsible.”
Dr Michael McGarvey,
President of Imperial
College UCU, told Felix:
“Imperial’s management
are telling students that
massive cuts to staff
pensions of up to 60% are
essential. The reality is
quite different. Independ-
ent analysis has shown
the basis for making these
cuts is false.”
He said “any disruption
to students lies squarely
with the senior manage-
ment who could instruct
their representatives to
return to the negotiation.
We urge students to
support the staff.”
In a statement for
Felix, Alex Chippy
Compton, ICU President,
said: “Union Council
voted overwhelmingly
to support the position of
UCU in their upcoming
strike, meaning ICU will
be writing to the Provost
and making the case where
we can to encourage
Imperial, and universities
across the UK, to return to
the negotiating table.”
“While we will do
what we can to minimise
the impact on students,
our elected student
representatives believe
the potential long-term
impact on quality of
teaching and job security
of academics is serious
enough that the students
should support their lec-
turers as they take strike
action on this issue.”
A College spokes-
person told Felix: " We
appreciate students may
have concerns about po-
tential disruption but the
College will be open as
usual and departments are
working hard to ensure
that teaching and assess-
ment activities continue
as normal.Any changes to
schedules will be commu-
nicated by Departments.
Advice for students is
available online."

of the Improving Access
to Psychological Thera-
pies (IAPT) programme.
However the CCG is
undergoing further con-
sultation with practices
and therapists, due to the
outcry generated by the
initial proposal.
ICHC, which is located
in Prince’s Gardens, is one
of a number of practices
that has raised concerns
over the changes, which
were initially set to take
effect in March. Under the
new system, ICHC could
see the amount of psycho-
therapy it can offer cut by
60%. Students and staff,
who make up the majority
of ICHC’s patient cohort,
along with local residents,
may have to go elsewhere
to access psychotherapy
services.
Under the new propos-
als, ICHC would only be
able to offer Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy
(CBT), and would have
to cut the psychodynamic
therapy they offer – a loss
of three days a week. This
reduction would likely
have a knock-on effect on
Imperial’s in-house coun-
selling service, which
has been struggling with
student demand over the
last few years.
The rationale from
the Clinical Commis-
sioning Group is that the
change would improve
borough-wide accessi-
bility – since not all GP
surgeries currently offer
psychotherapy sessions
– and make it easier to
assess treatment outcomes
and ensure good clinical
governance.
However, clinicians at
ICHC have cited potential
barriers to accessibility,
as patients may have to
travel further to reach their
appointments. Concerns
have also been raised over
the potential impact that
the loss of psychotherapy
services will have on the
multi-disciplinary team
approach offered by
the Health Centre. This
currently enables them
to support, in-house,
many of those with more
complex mental health
needs.
This move comes as
psychiatry services in the
NHS are coming under
increasing pressure.
The number of patients
seeking help for mental
health problems like
eating disorders or sub-
stance abuse problems has
hit a record high, while a
lack of services has meant
an increasing number of
patients are having to get
sectioned before they can
access treatment. A recent
report from the King’s
Fund showed mental
health budgets were ex-
panding at a much slower
rate than physical therapy
services, prompting con-
cerns that patients were
receiving poorer quality
care as a result.
Psychotherapy, a broad
term covering a range of
non-pharmaceutical ther-
apies, is widely used as a
treatment for a number of
mental health problems,
including depression and
anxiety. CBT is one of the
most well-known forms,
but other types include
psychodynamic psycho-
therapy and Cognitive
Analytic Therapy (CAT).

On standing together
A
fter six months,
we’ve finally
got there: a
Union Council
session that was actually
exciting! This week saw
another meeting of Union
Council, which opened
with a long discussion
about the upcoming
strikes, which are set to
take place later this week.
For those of you not in
the know – obviously
first-time readers of Felix
– these strikes are the
culmination of long-run-
ning debates around
pension pay for university
workers.
Previously, most
people working at a uni-
versity were guaranteed
a certain amount for their
pension fund. However,
under new plans from
Universities UK (UUK),
who cite unsustainable
costs, the scheme will
be changed. As a result,
some estimates state that
workers could lose up
to 60% of their pension
fund, and, as a result,
people have been up in
arms. The Universities
and College Union (UCU)
have planned 14 days of
strike action, starting this
week, and then slowly es-
calating before a full week
of strike action in March.
That’s the summary
version. If you want to
find out more about it,
then I’d recommend
speaking to some of your
lecturers – I’m sure they’ll
have a lot to say about
the potential changes.
But what came out of
the discussion at Council
was a vote for the Union
to officially support the
strikes. While acknowl-
edging that the strikes
would cause disruption
– what else would be the
point of them? – and that
this should be minimised
as far as possible, Union
representatives will back
the UCU in discussions
with senior management.
There were a few im-
portant points raised in the
Council session, which
I’ve been pondering
over for a few days. One
representative said that
he didn’t feel he could
support something that
would cause disruption
to the students we are
supposed to represent,
and – while it’s fair to
feel concerned about the
impact it could have on
students – I think refusing
to support the strikers
would cause much more
of a disruption to all of
our education. This debate
is not about the next few
weeks, or even about the
next few years; it’s about
the long-term future of
our education. How can
we expect to have lec-
turers who are motivated
if they’re worried about
what’s going to happen
when they retire? How
will we attract the best
and the brightest if we
can’t guarantee them a
future? When talking
about salaries in excess of
£100k, the College always
say they are needed to get
the highest quality people
in – why doesn’t that
apply to everyone?
We’re facing the thin
end of a short wedge. If
things aren’t done now,
and by us, the future of
education looks bleak.
Another important
point was raised by
someone else in Council,
regarding the nature of
a Union. It can be easy
to forget, among all the
debates around room
space or Bud Light, that
a students’ union is, at
its heart, a collective. It’s
even in the name: union.
As a student, a represent-
ative of the student body,
and as an employee of
Imperial College Union, I
think it’s vitally important
to stand together, as a
collective, and encourage
Imperial, and other UK
universities, to go back
to the negotiating table. I
hope you do too.
