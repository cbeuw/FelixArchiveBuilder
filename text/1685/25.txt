I
C Squash took the
train up North and
stormed the Quarter-
Finals and Finals of
the World Championship
held in Manchester
– nothing short of high-
class squash drama.
IC Squash was greeted
by the MC as “the rowdy
crowd in the back,” at the
start of Quarter-Finals
day, immediately charac-
terising our presence at the
event. We were treated to
a sublime performance
from the ‘French General’
Gregory Gaultier, who
saw off Paul ‘Superman’
Coll from New Zealand
in a dominant 3/0 win.
Overcoming our British
reserve, we pleaded for
and secured a post-match
group picture with the
former World Champion.
The women’s draw
was dominated by the
Egyptians; number one
seed Nour ElSherbini
showed her ambitions
to retain her title with a
clear 3/0 against Nouran
Gohar. Tesnie Evans from
Wales, who dispatched
England’s number one
Laura Massaro in the
second round, faced
Nour ElTayeb. Despite
the crowd getting behind
her, she lost her tightly
contested Quarter-Final.
While the majority of the
IC Squash players asked
for pictures and auto-
graphs with the players,
IC squash’s No 1 Pamela
Hathway, a former
German national player,
got the chance for a catch
up with her old friends and
former rivals, now at the
very top of the women’s
international rankings.
The day ended with
England’s No1 Nick Mat-
thew’s last appearance at
a World Championship.
He faced the tournament
favourite – and arguably
the best player over the
past twelve months –
Mohamed ElShorbagy.
The ‘Beast from Alex-
andria’ got off to a better
start and forced Matthew
into long and testing
rallies, knowing that the
37-year old struggled
with age and injuries.
ElShorbagy threatened
to march through to the
Semi-Finals, but Matthew
dug deep and with
massive support on home
soil as well as the odd
rowdy chant from the IC
gang (“Matthew’s on fire,
ElShorbagy’s terrified”)
he won the 3rd
game.
However, ElShorbagy
regrouped, won the 4th
game and denied Matthew
a famous comeback.
Unfortunately we weren’t
able to catch both of them
for selfies as we had to
storm off to the station in
order to catch the last train
back to London – it turned
out to be late anyway.
IC Squash returned to
rainy Manchester for the
Finals. While most con-
tented themselves with
the front wall view, four
lucky members enjoyed
the best seats in the house,
flanked by the players’
coaches, partners, and
parents. With England’s
former World No 1 James
‘Jimbo’ Willstrop sat
two rows behind them,
they witnessed the drama
unfold in two all-Egyptian
finals.
Marwan overcame Ali
Farag in the Semi-Finals
in a tight encounter that
went the full distance,
which should have
drained his tank for the
final, whereas Mohamed
dropped only one game to
Nick Matthew on his way
to the final and was the
bookies’ favourite.
The match started
with high octane rallies,
and Mohamed played
with better accuracy,
finishing the rallies in
style. At 2-0 down to
his brother in the World
Championship final,
Marwan gave everything
he had left, producing
mega-rallies and shot of
the month contenders.
Marwan managed to get
the large crowd behind
him, which frenetically
celebrated every rally he
won. He took the third
and fourth game to wipe
out Mohamed’s lead. The
deciding game saw the
momentum swing back
and forth and the audience
were treated to a match
fully worth every penny.
The atmosphere was
palpably tense and Man-
chester Central was now in
the throes of high drama.
At 3-6 down, Mohamed
increased the pace and,
with accurate length
and relentless hitting,
forced Marwan into
making errors. Mohamed
regained his concentration
while Marwan seemed to
lose faith. Having drawn
level, he then pulled away
to clinch the game and
trophy for the first time.
After the prize giving
ceremony, we were able
to take selfies with the
finalists and even with
Nick Matthew, whom we
had missed on the day of
the Quarters. Overall, IC
Squash was treated to two
highly spectacular finals
and thoroughly enjoyed
the trips to Manchester.

“IC Squash’s
No1 Pamela
Hathway got
the chance for
a catch up with
her old friends
and former
rivals”
The women’s final
saw the top-seeded
players Nour ElSherbini
and Raneem ElWelily
compete for the most
prestigious title in squash.
The reigning Champion
ElSherbini had played a
testing five-gamer with
Nour ElTayeb the day
before the finals, while
Raneem ElWelily had
dropped just two games
in the whole tournament.
Surprisingly, ElSherbini
started as if she were com-
pletely fresh legged and
stormed off to a one game
lead. With former World
No 1 Karim Darwish
in her corner, ElWelily
introduced subtle holds in
her swing and managed
to stop ElSherbini’s
movement. ElSherbini
could find no answer to El-
Welily’s error-free squash
and ElWelily deservedly
won the match and was
crowned World Champion
for the first time.
The men’s final saw two
brothers, Mohamed and
Marwan ElShorbagy, go
head to head for the first
time in a championship
final, with their parents
both in the crowd. Both
ElShorbagys are based in
Bristol, occasionally com-
peting at BUCS events.
