Visual novels – A unique form of storytelling
An examination of an argulably less popular genre of gaming but one eqaully as entertaining as the others.
A
few years ago,
you wouldn’t
have been able
to find more
than one or two games on
Steam catergorised under
the ‘visual novel’ format.
In recent years however,
their popularity has been
growing; now there are a
number of visual novels
that are considered
mainstream. In spite of
that, visual novels are
largely dismissed by some
members of the gaming
community as not being
‘real’ games and having
little value as games.
Before we can discuss
visual novels and why
dismissing them is wrong,
we need to answer one
question: are visual
novels really games? This
question is one which
has infuriated several
people and has been a
source of heated debate.
To get a clear answer to
this question, it’ll help
to introduce some game
designer lingo we can
play around with.
To describe video
games from a more
academic perspective,
there are two different
terms that are used, nar-
ratology and ludology.
The narratology approach
states that games are
fundamentally another
medium of narrative and
storytelling, in a similar
fashion to novels and
films, and should therefore
be approached in such
a fashion. The ludology
approach, however,
states that games are
fundamentally interactive
systems and any story
they’re trying to tell is of
secondary importance to
the gameplay itself.
“As the market
and popularity
of these
games grew,
so did their
variety and
accessibility”
“Cross-genre
visual novels
contain other
aspects of
games”
From these definitions,
it is obvious to see visual
novels fall into the nar-
ratological approach to
video games. They are,
at the end of day, novels
with art, music, and a
text heavy narrative. Any
mini-games or gameplay
aspects they have usually
serve to add to the plot
as opposed to standing
alongside it. However,
some visual novels
have a more ludological
approach as well.
There are some visual
novels which have more
classic video game
elements such as those
of RPG games. You get
to control the characters
in the story and can get
involved in sequnces
requiring fine hand-eye
coordination. At the end
of the day, however, while
visual novels should
technically be considered
games, there will always
be people who will argue
against this and pick
something like Call of
Duty over Phoenix Wright.
One could ask how
visual novels became so
popular in the first place.
When they started out,
they were a bit more
niche; they were predom-
inantly popular in Japan
and mostly consisted
of ‘dating simulators’.
People made their own
translations and imported
them online where the
demand for these types
of games grew from other
players around the world.
The developers then made
more versions of these
games, translated and
dubbed, to help cater to
this niche market. As the
market and popularity of
these games grew, so did
their variety and accessi-
bility.
They grew to encom-
pass more than just dating
simulators and began
overlapping with quite
a few genres. It’s gotten
to the point where even
western developers are
also joining the market
and making their own
visual novels. Telltale
Games are an especially
popular studio, having
produced several critically
acclaimed series like The
Walking Dead. Even some
indie studios are getting in
on the action with recent
hits like Dream Daddy:
A Dad Dating Simulator
and Doki Doki Literature
Club.
A large reason for
their popularity boom
and success is the fact
that visual novels are
very flexible. While they
are a genre in and of
themselves, they can also
overlap with other types
of games with regards
to story or gameplay.
Cross-genre visual novels
contain other aspects of
games such as dramatic
survival horror with The
Walking Dead and puzzle
solving with Professor
Layton. These types of
visual novels are usually
more appealing to the
casual audience and are
the ones that, at the end
of the day, are the most
mainstream. In fact, these
particular games are
more than just interactive
novels with pretty pictures
and nice music: they are
damn awesome games in
their own right.
What’s the real selling
point of visual novels?
As the name might
imply, they are just very
good at telling stories. In
fact, you could consider
them the middle ground
between reading a book
or watching a movie and
using VR or roleplaying
to experience a story
yourself. Visual novels
can act as ‘choose’ your
own adventure games,
where you control the
characters and can choose
which direction you want
the story to go. Granted,
this is arguably limited,
as for all intents and
purposes, you can only
really stick to the the story
and direction specified by
the developers (something
players of Telltale games
are often frustrated by).
But in their defence,
programming stories
which can take multiple
directions and endings
are a lot of work and are
usually left for games
which are also heavy
on gameplay and length
to really get a fulfilling
experience. Having said
that, the choices you make
in most visual novels feel
impactful in the moment
and if nothing else, get
the player personally
invested at that time. At
the end of the day, you can
always get emotionally
invested in the story and
cry your eyes out at select
moments.
Ultimately, visual
novels are a genre unlike
any other in that they are
focused on storytelling
but with a different pres-
entation and interaction
than what you’d get from
a book or film. Just make
sure you can tolerate
reading: if not, you might
as well stick to shooting
down enemy soldiers.
