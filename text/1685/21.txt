Temple of Seitan: The ultimate vegan fried chicken?
I
f you haven’t heard
of Temple of Seitan,
let me give you a
rundown. Vegan fried
chicken.
The cries of outrage
in response to the word
‘vegan’ that aligns to the
reaction towards the word
‘feminism’ is to be ad-
dressed in another article.
For now, it is sufficient to
say that in my opinion,
the myths that veganism
immediately equates to
healthy, expensive and
impossible, are just that –
myths.
With a current rating
of 4.6 from 617 reviews
on Google, this Hack-
ney-based vegan takeout
place is undoubtedly a
well-regarded and popular
one. Ironically located
next to a butchery, the
small fast food-esque
establishment often has
lines of people queuing
out the door. The no frills
menu is based around
their signature fried
chicken which constitutes
of seitan – a gluten, wheat
based protein source that
has a meaty texture and
accommodates whatever
flavours are introduced to
it. A couple of sides and
off-menu dessert items are
also offered.
I got the Spicy Temple
Burger – a steal at £6 or
make it a meal with a side
of fries and a cola as I did
for an additional £2.
With the tantalizing
smell of fried food in the
air, the American diner-in-
spired store was crowded
with people ordering food
and waiting for it to be
prepared. Every so often
the cashier would call out
a name that corresponded
to the brown paper bag
she held up, and the sea
of heads would all turn
towards her in hopeful
excitement.
After what seemed like
a tormentous time waiting
(be patient McDonald’s
frequenters!), my name
was finally hollered. And
there it was – a vegan
burger that truly lives
up to its rep. One bite
in and I was taken. The
chicken was the most
realistic mock meat I’ve
had with a texture vaguely
The bun too was im-
pressive, soft with slight
sweetness like brioche,
complementing the
‘chicken’ well. The fries
were standard (but good)
and a generous portion,
skinny and crunchy with
just the lightest pinch of
salt. Needless to say, the
burger was savoured and
gone within minutes and I
left Hackney feeling very
much fulfilled considering
my wearing and hazardous
journey there through the
miserable English rain.
This place is a must try
for vegans that are looking
to explore the various
culinary indulgences
that modern plant-based
technology can offer, for
curious meat-eaters and
especially sceptics. Plant-
based foods need not be
dubbed as ‘just salad’
– you can easily enjoy
the same foods you ex-
perienced as a meat-eater
as a vegan or vegetarian;
various restaurants have
already introduced vegan
versions of foods such
as pizza, Bolognese, fish
and chips, and now, fried
chicken!
Note: Hackney is far
from Central London
– blessedly, a second
store has opened up its
doors in Camden – hailed
Temple of Camden, with
the same offerings plus
new beef-inspired burgers
on the menu. I suppose
it’s about time for another
indulgence!
Eat Tokyo: Budget-friendly Japanese Delights
I
’ve been meaning to
rave about this small
chain that boasts au-
thentic Japanese food
for a while, but my degree
has unfortunately been
distracting me. Although
Eat Tokyo has locations
throughout London and
Japan, I have only visited
the Holborn restaurant so
far. The Hammersmith
and Notting Hill branch-
es are probably more
conveniently located for
Imperial students if you
are keen to give the food a
try for yourselves, which
you really should, go on,
treat yourself.
After ducking under
the precariously low
banner hanging above the
front entrance - who said
wasabi was the most dan-
gerous aspect of Japanese
food - you are initially
struck by the liveliness of
the entrance, filled with
eager customers waiting
for a table and sushi being
expertly crafted behind
the counter to your right.
With the exception of the
ornate wooden booths
placed in the first room
that you come across, the
décor within the maze of
following rooms is con-
siderably more basic, but
no matter, you are here for
the food.
My first experience of
Eat Tokyo’s menu was
simply overwhelming.
Upon opening the no-
vella-sized booklet filled
with enticing glossy
pictures, I started to panic
at the prospect of making
a decision. If you are as
indecisive as me, I would
recommend a bento box,
which is essentially a
few mini meals in one.
My favourite comes with
chicken teriyaki, salmon,
sushi, rice and salad,
which somehow, they
also make taste amazing.
Although I haven’t tried it
myself, I’ve been told that
the Tokyo Dragon is, and
quote, “life-changing”-
quite an endorsement. For
this dish, sushi is arranged
in a row with a prawn
mimicking the head of the
dragon. It certainly looks
impressive.
What’s more, Eat
Tokyo is surprisingly
affordable. You can easily
dine out here for under
a tenner (as long as you
steer clear of the drinks).
Fans of the katsu curry
will rejoice; you can order
a massive, and I mean
massive, portion to share
for only £9. Meaning, you
can eat out in London for
under a fiver – miracles do
happen.

“One bite
in and I was
taken”
resembling that of cheap
childhood nuggets. The
myriad of flavours were
strong, salty with a spicy
kick and did not shy away
from the label ‘junk food’
in the best possible way.
