Loveless: Andrey Zvyagintsev gets under the skin of
modern Russia
A
n d r e y
Zvyagintsev’s
Loveless, his
follow up
to his 2014 Leviathan,
features one of the most
haunting images I’ve
encountered in cinema:
Shenya (Maryana Spivak)
and Boris (Aleksey
Rozin), a middle-class
couple in the throes of an
ugly divorce, argue about
what they should do with
their son Alexey (Matvey
Novikov), a child who
neither of them really
wanted; as Zhenya storms
around their small, un-
assuming apartment, she
slams a door shut, reveal-
ing the tormented face of
Alexey, his face locked in
a silent cry of anguish. He
has heard the whole thing.
It is this impactful event
that drives forward the
rest of Zvyagintsev’s film,
which serves as a precise
and damning analysis of
the current state of Russia.
Zvyagintsev wields his
camera like a surgeon’s
knife, delicately lifting up
the thin skin of modern
society and revealing
the darkness that festers
underneath.
While Alexey’s
presence in the film is – by
virtue of the plot’s design
– limited, it is this image
that lingers throughout its
duration. Shortly after the
argument, Alexey goes
missing, last seen running
from their Moscow apart-
ment block on CCTV.
These tower blocks
break up an undulating
landscape of trees and
snow, forming a liminal
space on the outskirts of
Moscow. Zvyagintsev
manages to master the
psychology of space, and
the use of architecture is
just one tool in this brutal
and harrowing account
of both the divides
between the parents, and
the hypocrisy of modern
Russian culture.
While in other films a
missing child might serve
to bring couples together
in mutual anguish, in
Loveless, as the name
suggests, it only serves
to drive more of a wedge
between them. Boris,
working in a company
whose religious policy
means everyone there
is happily married, has
already moved on from
Zhenya, and has a heav-
ily-pregnant girlfriend.
Zhenya, meanwhile, has
also taken on a lover, and
cut herself off from her
battle-axe of a mother – a
Soviet relic who lives
alone off a highway to
Kiev, like someone you
might encounter in the
work of Svetlana Alexiev-
ich.
Just as in Leviathan,
Zvyagintsev takes aim
at Russian officialdom,
with the police inspector
assigned to the case
explaining to Zhenya
that there’s nothing much
they can do about missing
children, when there are
murderers and rapists to
worry about; instead, he
recommends she get in
touch with a volunteer
organisation, who prove
themselves to be much
more effective than any
official body, scrupulously
combing the surrounding
area.
ubiquitous inclusion of
smartphones, for example,
is – I guess – supposed to
show us the shallowness
of modern life, but the
extent to which Zvyagint-
sev hammers home his
point reduces the impact
of the message.
Despite this, Zvyagint-
sev’s direction remains
sublime, with his camera
moving consistently,
albeit glacially, through
doorways and around
corners; in one impressive
long-shot at the start of
the film, reminiscent
of the unnerving work
of Michael Haneke, we
linger outside a school as
children run out, before
the lens picks out Alexey,
following him dutifully
down the street. When
the team are combing an
abandoned Soviet-era
complex near the apart-
ment, the film becomes an
exploration of the archi-
tecture of decay, no doubt
inspired by the ruin porn
photographic movement.
Pointed remarks turn to
arguments turn to physical
violence, as the disparity
and incompatibility of
Boris and Zhenya comes
to the fore. The couple
go from blaming each
other for Alexey’s disap-
pearance to making a trip
to the morgue to identify
the body of a child, but
throughout it all there
remains an undercurrent
of mutual resentment,
negating any possibility
of a happy conclusion.
Loveless’ name sounds
out like a warning: this is
not a film with a warming
message, or a beating
heart; it is a cold abyss of
a film, one that completely
drags you under, and traps
you in its power.
Following on from the success of Leviathan, the Russian director returns with another masterful film in which a
missing child serves to highlight one couple’s breakdown.
Loveless is a chilling exploration of modern Russia // Altitude

While the themes
explored in Loveless are
more engaging than in
Leviathan, with the main
marital conflict playing
out against a backdrop of
the Russian annexation

areas where the writing
