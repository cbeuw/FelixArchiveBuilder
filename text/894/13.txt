Now that I've got your attention, I shall
say that Jean Jacques Beineix, the
director of that infamous film, is
responsible for next week's Filmsoc
presentation, Diva. This is a stylish
French thriller concerning a n opera
singer, some illegal recordings of her
performing, a n d a n assortment of
criminals. T h e plot is sophisticated, with a
few twists a n d turns, so c o m e along at
7.30pm o n Thursday, M e c h E n g 220, a n d
polish up o n your French a n d culture.

Come & W a t c h Blasphemy.
There are bits i n the Bible that are erotic,
and i n some people's minds pornographic.
The 'Song of Soloman' is one of these
juicy pieces. In the last century John
Carlisle, being tried for blasphemy, was
prevented from reading publicly these
extracts.
There has been a tradition, within
Christianity, to explore the sexuality to be
found in its language a n d images. T h e
concepts of worship a n d love of the body
and spirit of Christ, as w e l l as the nun's
'marriage' to G o d , have been described in
sexual language. T h e famous blasphemy
Dance
IC Dance Club took four teams (16
couples) a n d seven ex-student couples to
Sheffield on Saturday February 2 for the
Sheffield inter-varsity competition. T h e
Sheffield is often viewed as a warm-up to
the more competitive S U D A a n d I V D A
events w h i c h will take place later this
term. The overall team results were not
startling, with both A a n d B teams
ranking third. Cambridge took both first
place trophies (which, incidentally, were
w o n by us last year) but w e did w i n the
Team Knockout competition (won by
Cambridge last year!).
O n a n individual basis some of the
results were quite encouraging: Team
Waltz was w o n (rather casually!) by
James Barron a n d Janet B o n d (A team)
who also came first in the Open Viennese
trial of 'Gay News', prosecuted by Mary
Whitehouse a n d her Christian 'moral'
crusaders, was for a poem b y a gay
Christian following this tradition: A
tradition that goes back centuries. T h e
film, Visions of Ecstacy, was made by two
Christians, based on the erotic dreams of
a nun in the 19th Century. It was banned
last year in this country for blasphemy.
To examine w h y this was done a n d as a
protest against the blasphemy law the T
H Huxley Society will be showing this
film i n the U n i o n Lounge at 1.15pm o n
Thursday 28 February. C o m e along a n d
find out w h y it was banned. 50p entrance
(free to members).
Waltz. Gareth Davies a n d Christine
Bearpark (A team) took first place in
T e a m Jive. W e thought that our A team
Cha C h a C h a couple Wendy T a n a n d
Mark Highman were very unfortunate to
have been k n o c k e d out in the semi-final
and would probably have been placed
quite highly h a d they made it to the final.
Our B team C h a couple Paul Ng a n d
Sarita Chandrasekharan took 3rd place.
In the Open competitions Eric a n d
A n n e came second in Rock a n d Roll with
a very acrobatic routine—well done! E x -
students Steve and Nicki w o n the Open
Samba but the fame went to Shuko
Noguchi a n d Rachel Condor w h o entered
with a hastily put together routine as a n
all-girl couple, a n d shocked everyone by
