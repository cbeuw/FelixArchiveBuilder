Dear Andy,
In reply to the small piece headed 'Real
Funding', there were so many points
raised in the article it is difficult to k n o w
where to start. It is far too easy to blame
individuals up to and including sabbaticals
for the state of the Union now (mind you,
Council approved expenditure for
surveying 2,000 students according to the
President's report request, but at the U G M
he claimed it was for 1,200-1,500
students, an increased cost of 25-40%.
And he reckons I'm trying to mislead
Council!?!? Couldn't resist that one Shan).
But on closer reflection the blame can't
lie there. Elected individuals are endorsed
to try and put in their own ideas and
feelings for what is best for the students,
whilst enacting their will as well from
UGMs etc. The failure of these are not an
indication of the weakness of any
proposals, but the inappropriateness of
their conception in the current climate.
However, in the light of new proposals
to abolish the U G M , I feel the first place
to start is with the committee structure.
Presently, the U G M is the sovereign body
of ICU, followed by Council, then U F C is
beneath Council. Now U F C is supposed to
give advice and investigate the finances
of the Union. So, it would be obvious that
UFC should report to Council. BUT, a few
years ago Council thought that it was
doing too m u c h work, and since the
majority of U F C seemed to be a sensible
committee, so w h y abolish it. Hence, all
Union financial matters are decided by
UFC, then theoretically rubber-stamped
by Council, though now matters don't
seem to get that far, they are just
accepted.
So that's the current situation now, but
it seems that the decisions of the Union's
past are now catching up with us in a big
way. If UGMs are to go then Council will
have to take more responsibility. Is that
likely to happen. Well, from Mr Eyers
reckoning, only a few people bother to
take part in important discussions. Thanks
for that, I'm sorry if people are thinking
that I'm not saying enough, but I'm not
sure what's going on half the time. I can
only presume that their education here is
second to none and that they understand
perfectly what's going on. I doubt that,
but the more accurate answer would be
that people are not bold enough to ask
questions. A n d who can blame them? I've
been here nearly four years and never
for one moment felt 100% comfortable
about what's going on!
Your editorial said 'the only way things
can get any better is if you get involved'.
A more accurate perception would have
been '...if you get INVOICED!'
Yours,
A wfully-bogged-down,
Spenser Lane, SCC Chairman.
United?
Dear Andy,
I wonder what the Children of the
Winnie Mandela Centre for the Under
Fives, think about her recent appearance
in court on the charges of assault and
abduction. The allegations involve the
feared Mandela Utd football team which
she 'managed' whilst her husband was
enjoying prison life. The captain of this
football club has already been found
guilty of the murder or poor little
Stompie.
This centre for the under fives is not, as
you would imagine in a shanty town of
Soweto, but i n the London Borough of
Islington. I was wondering what a
conversation between a pupil and teacher
might be like at this centre: 'Well, Johnny
don't drop that paint pot again or I'll rip
your throat out with a pair of garden
shears. Don't even think about telling
your parents or we'll go round your
house, set fire to it, and gang rape your
sister.'
This would be consistent with the
Mandela Utd code of practice. They have
been responsible for the fear that has
swept many black townships. This is
shown by the reluctance of prosecution
witnesses to come forward to testify
against the 'manager'. I must admit I
have very little respect for either Mrs
Mandela or her terrorist husband,
particularly since her now famous
quotation 'With our matches and our
necklaces we will liberate this land.'
Isn't it sad that whilst President De
Klerk is doing wonderful work with his
reforms in the Republic of South Africa,
the main news that's coming out of this
country is the trial of a w i c k e d woman?
Islington council should immediately re-
name the centre. Perhaps after some
great British hero. H o w about the
Margaret Thatcher centre for the Under
Fives or even after Norman Tebbit or
Enoch Powell. However knowing
Islington Council as I do, they'd probably
name it after Saddam Hussein!
Yours,
Alan Bailey.
P.S. I have accepted your challenge of a
public debate. You've got m y number so
when will you let me know the details?
