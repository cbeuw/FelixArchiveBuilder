Apologies...?
Dear Saddam Hussein,
I'm writing to apologise for the terrible
crimes our Imperialist Fascist
Governments have committed against
your country, and to assure y o u that
even here and in 'the Great Satan' there
are plenty of people who wish you no
harm whatsoever.
All throughout this crisis we have been
calling for a peaceful solution, and we
have regularly condemned America's
persistent aggression. Even n o w after four
weeks of war w e feel it is not too late to
negotiate. Y o u showed yourself to be a
reasonable and amiable gentleman by the
help you gave to the foreigners stranded
in Iraq and Kuwait. Our leaders on the
other hand are obstinate a n d pig-headed
idiots whose refusal to negotiate is a
damning indictment o n our so-called
democracy.
For the past month 'the Allies' have
been bombing hell out of Iraq, and what
has it achieved? Y o u r continued missile
attacks on Saudi A r a b i a and Israel show
that the bombing is having no real effect
on your army, and obviously you don't
give a toss about civilian casualties. A
bloke I met i n the pub said this war is
costing us over forty million quid a day—
that's nearly half what the NHS gets! The
Tories are closing hospitals to pay for
someone else's war, and w e say enough
is enough.
Here's the plan: with everyone's
attention turned to the Gulf (perhaps you
could turn the heat up a bit?) we the
people will rise up and sieze power,
smash the Tories, abolish the Poll Tax,
and stop the Gulf War. W e offer y o u this
God And...
Dear Andy,
1. I won't admit m y n a m e because I'm
scared? Bullshit. As I have said before, I
won't tell you because it reduces m y
credibility when arguing the point. W o u l d
Mr Cooksley (892) accuse me of being
feminist if I were a 'bloke'? W o u l d I be
rascist if I were coloured? (Sorry, I'd like
to check with the white majority out
there if I'm allowed to use the w o r d
coloured. No one seems to ask the
minorities.) I will also admit that in m y
earlier letters I was deliberately
inflmatory, and I don't promise not to do
it again.
2. In the letters' page most people put
forward a premise, and draw some logical
opinion and conclusions from it. The logic
is often incorrect or the premise perhaps
leaves things out. But you try. There is
an exception to this rule. Christians put
compromise: if we pull all our troops out
of the Gulf, y o u get out of Kuwait. Y o u
can keep everything you've nicked—the
Kuwaitis are rich and will easily rebuild
their country.
In fact—what the heck—you can keep
Kuwait. The girl at the chippie reckons
the Al-Sabahs who ran Kuwait are
dictators—all 1200 of 'em. The people of
Kuwait aren't m u c h better. The National
Union of K u w a i t i Students say they've
been trying to get rid of the Al-Sabahs
since 1964. It only took us eleven years
to get rid of our dictator, so clearly N U K S
aren't trying very hard. They don't
deserve a country of their o w n . Besides,
Kuwait has only been around since 1710,
so they've no real historical claim to
independence.
On top of all that, we don't even need
Kuwait. Someone I was chatting to in the
bog said they only produced 8% of the
world's oil, so even if you nuked the
whole place it wouldn't hurt us in the
West very m u c h . Of course, y o u would
have to make a solemn pledge not to
invade Saudi A r a b i a or anywhere else;
and keep that promise, not like the one
you made about not invading K u w a i t -
naughty boy! In return w e will remove all
A m e r i c a n and U K forces and businesses
from all Arabic countries; destroy all our
atomic biological and chemical weapons;
pay you substantial compensation for the
millions of civvies you say have been
killed; and m a k e y o u honorary president
of the L o n d o n School of Economics.
Best Wishes,

Rejects against the Gulf War.
forward a premise such as 'In Luke
3:16...' This is not a valid basis for any
argument unless you are debating the
Bible. It cannot be applied to any other
situation as the Bible (and. Koran etc) is
heavily biased. Do you Christians believe
the book of M o r m o n , or the Moonies? No
you don't.
I make a premise and conclusion and
try to answer any logical discussion.
However you religious types do not allow
any logical criticism of the Bible etc. 'It's
true, God told me in prayer.' O h then it
must be true. F * * k off. It just doesn't
stand up. M r Butcher is not banning
Christians from writing in, he is just
saying he will not tolerate any argument
supported by fiction, not matter how old
it is.
