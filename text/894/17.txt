things. First; tribalism. In m a n y African
states white domination of blacks has
been replaced with maybe one tribe
dominating all the others. In South Africa
we have the communist A N C and the
tribal Inkatha movement. Because of
world arms embargoes, South Africa now
has a huge weapons industry. I do not
think that either group is sophisticated
enough to handle the responsibility yet.
At the same time I do not think this
should be used to perpetuate Apartheid.
A n y o n e got an opinion?
4. Mascotry. This is a proud tradition. It
enabled about eight guys on each team to
play soldier and use warlike talkies,
directing youthful freshers in defence of
their mascot. It allows ten people to pile
into the back of a Hertz v a n and drive at
silly speeds around London. The Unions
have squads of cars and motor bikes to
pursue the vans.
V e r y soon a van will pull out of College
at high speed and hit a child, a car,
maybe just a lamp-post. The drivers are
good, but there's no accounting for the
other idiots o n the road. There is going
to be a witness who reports ten people
running from the back carrying a metallic
object. The hire company will piece
together that a) ten people is illegal and
b) the van was being used for mascotry.
They are highly likely to say that the
insurance is therefore invalid, and the
Union is legally responsible for the repair
of the van (thousands), and personal
damages to the victim, w h i c h can come
to millions.
Toilet Talk
Dear Andy,
I'm not quite sure how it is that a small
minority of people are allowed to grafitti
and destroy the Union Building toilets but
they have. Today I went to the bog by
the bar for a good dump and find no
toilet seat or functioning door lock. I then
crossed to the one by the lobby at the
foot of the stairs and found no bog paper
and the walls covered in grafitti. Maybe
I'm overly sensitive but I think that
instead of £4K to a management
consultant, perhaps £2K refurbishment
and maintenance of the heads should be
a good idea?
A man with a real anus.
P.S. At least the toilets were clean, last
time I went I found a lake of chunder in
one and a still vomiting member of Beans
Club in the other, unconscious.
This is not even a worst case scenario.
Lots of schools crocodile children around
the area. It will happen sometime. It will
be a rare event, but when it happens for
the first time there is going to be severe
hell to pay.
This is something I think people should
be concerned about. The mascots are
hardly ever seen, kept in secret locations
by the chosen few. They hardly ever
raise money for charity as they are rarely
stolen. Mines doesn't appear to care one
way or the other (at least they don't risk
lives).
I have an idea for an alternative:
The mascots must be stored somewhere
on College grounds. They must be
brought to all U G M s and any Union
event.
I think this will have the following
effects:
1. The mascots will have a m u c h higher
profile, creating support a n d reducing
apathy.
2. They will get stolen a lot more often,
generating even more patriotism and
loads of money.
3. There is no chance of hitting
someone with a van.
4. The top secret mascotry teams might
complain that they'll have no fun. (Well
not publicly, but they'll oppose m y plan
for that reason.) I would say to them that
the challenge of getting it across College
once a week or so will be much more
satisfying.
