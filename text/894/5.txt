Russia House
The name's Blair, Barley Blair.
Somehow, it doesn't have quite the
same ring about it, does it? Sean
Connery's return to the spy game is a
long way from his outings as the world's
most famous secret agent, and 007's
glamorous w o r l d is a far cry from this
m u c h more realistic portrayal of
East/West espionage.
Russia House, is a slow, cerebral
thriller, set in the heady day of the
introduction of Glasnost. The west
remains jubilant, the Russians, cynical.
They spymasters? The want the good old
days of the C o l d W a r back. W h e n a
beautiful Russian literary agent (the
beautiful, if not Russian, Michelle Pfeiffer)
offers drunken Scots publisher (Connery,
w h o is, without doubt, Scots) a book
w h i c h reveals that the Russians are well
behind in the A r m s race, they are
positively drooling over the possibilities
that open up.
This film is very m u c h a product of
Glasnost, both i n it being the result of the
author's first trip to Moscow, and in being
the first film to be allowed to shoot freely
in the USSR. T h e attitude is very post
Glasnost too. There are no real 'goodies'
or 'baddies', instead several different
shades of grey. E v e n the most principled
R u s a l k a
I Rusalka is the water n y m p h w h o
falls in love with a h u m a n prince
and begs the witch Jezibaba
to transform her into a w o m a n . She pays
the terrible price of losing the power of
speech and, w h e n she is rejected by her
lover, is estranged from both the human
and spirit world.
Kvapil's text is inspired by myths as
diverse as Anderson's The Little Mermaid,
Czech poet Erben's ballad about The
Water Spirit and Fouque's tale of Undine,
but is suffused by Czech folk beliefs in
which there is no good or evil, but where
man, alienated from nature, is corrupt.
Dvorak's setting is Wagnerian in scale
and construction, but displays his talent
for lyrical melody and rich orchestration.
It also evinces bravery in composing for a
heroine who is dumb for m u c h of the
second act.
Musically, this is an excellent
production. Nancy Gustavson as Rusalka
has both the strength and subtlety to
handle the lead role; N o r m a n Bailey as
the Water Spirit has gravitas and conveys
an old man's forebodings of youth's
unwise choices; Felicity Palmer's Jezibaba
is a malevolent delight, crisp and
powerfully sung.
The set is also marvellous, contributing
to the magical aura of the production.
White boards slide back to reveal a cool
blue pool in the centre of an almost
characters are forced to sell out in the
end, to preserve themselves. If anyone
emerges in a truly negative light, it is the
Americans, who ride roughshod over the
British, desperately trying to restart the
cold war, to facilitate greater arms
contracts for A m e r i c a n companies.
A n d so, this broad tale develops against
the glorious, if surprisingly alien,
backdrop of the major Russian cities,
beautifully fitted to the cinemascope in
which it is filmed. The performances are
all nicely measured, excepting K e n
Russell's (better k n o w n as a director)
bizarre appearance as an expert on
Russia, about w h i c h I have certain
reservations. Otherwise, this is an
extremely acceptable espionage movie,
the best I've seen in a while.
Pendragon
entirely white set; a mirror reflects the
striking deep blue backcloth w h i c h
depicts the sky; Rusalka sits on a swing
suspended mid-stage. In the second act,
the palace is represented by a glass room
which revolves around Rusalka as she sits
suspended on the swing; later she scuttles
around its glass walls like a trapped
spider. In the third act we return to the
pool w h i c h is n o w darkened, the mirror
is smashed and a bloated m o o n hangs
against the inky night.
It is sad that the acting is not up to the
rest of the performance. The portrayal of
the palace staff as spineless, mindless rag
dolls shows some inspiration in the
direction, but mostly the cast alternate
between melodramatic h a m m i n g and
aimless activity.
Overall, a production to see, if only for
the orchestral playing w h i c h I would
happily have sat through as a concert
performance. However, it is sad that the
sexual messages of the legend and the
opera, exemplified by Rusalka's
dumbness, were skated over and never
properly addressed.
