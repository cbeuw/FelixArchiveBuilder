Despite a preference f o r t i n k e r i n g with the

was seldom i n a o o n d l t l o n to do any s e r i o u s d i s -
c i p l i n i n g when the proceedings verged on thd

l a s t New Year's Eve when he e n t e r e d a room a t
random a t 2 o'clock i n the morning and shook i t s
somnolent occupant i n t o l i f e f o r the purpose of

The v a r i o u s i n t e r e s t e d female students, who sug-
gested an ICWA r o t a f o r f u t u r e f u n c t i o n s , had a
nasty shook on r e a d i n g a r e c e n t copy of the
D a i l y Telegraph wherein was announced the engage-
ment of some other Mlohael_John Neale. However
the f l u t t e r i n g of l o w a r i a n h e a r t s has been calmed â€¢
by a f i r m d e c l a r a t i o n of the p r e s i d e n t i a l p o l i c y

The chromium-plated r e s e a r o h apparatus which
Mike has b u i l t over the past 5 y e a r s i s now ex-

P H C E N I X
A f t o r s e v e r a l years' a c t i v e connection w i t h
l i t e r a t u r e In Imperial College, I have come t o be-
l i e v e t h a t Phoenix e x i s t s p r i m a r i l y f o r the b e n e f i t
of i t s w r i t e r s ; not f o r the readers, who merely
defray some o f the costs of p u b l i c a t i o n . Phoenix
l o s t much of i t s o r i g i n a l f u n c t i o n when FELIX began
to p u b l i s h news, but I t has s t i l l the advantage of
being able to make u n l i m i t e d space and an impeccable
standard of production a v a i l a b l e to s e r i o u s r e p o r t s
and essays. In the l a s t few years, i t has been
c l e a r that these f a c i l i t i e s have been n e g l e c t e d : the
only people who have concerned themselves w i t h l i t -
erary shapeliness have been the few who have w r i t t e n
on i n c o n s e q u e n t i a l matters. E v e r y t h i n g s e r i o u s has
been shockingly w r i t t e n .
There has Just been an o p p o r t u n i t y f o r t h i s
p i t i f u l s t a t e of a f f a i r s t o be mended: our f o u r C o l -
lege P r e s i d e n t s and two other students went t o Ger-
many on a t o u r of t e c h n i c a l i n s t i t u t i o n s . I do not
know how much money was spent on t h i s ; n e i t h e r do I
know whether any o f f i c i a l repoets of the v i s i t have
been submitted In any q u a r t e r s (though a beery w r i t e
up appered i n FELIX ) ; but the account of the t o u r
whioh takes up two pages of the Phoenix under review,
i s d u l l and u s e l e s s . There Is no s p a r k l e , no show
of i n t e r e s t , no joy of c r e a t i o n shown In t h i s r e p o r t .
One would suppose t h a t a f o r t n i g h t ' s f r e e h o l i d a y
for s i x of our h i g h e s t Union O f f i c e r s might produce
something more Imaginative than t h i s .
What a r e l i e f i t i s to t u r n to Selby Angus's
short story "The Higher M e t a l l u r g y " . T h i s i s r e p r i n t -
ed, without acknowledgements, from a Phoenix of f o u r
years ago. I had r a t h e r w r i t t e n "The Higher M e t a l l -
urgy" than obtained my degree. Hay i t be r e p r i n t e d
every f o u r years as an example of what students c o u l d
once w r l t e j T h i s remarkeble s t o r y i s backed up by a
other of P e t e r Rowe's c h a r a c t e r sketches, "A S l i g h t
Touch of Toothache", which i s even b e t t e r than i t s
predecessor on l a n d l a d i e s . Ilr. Rowe seems t o have
a phenomenol number of odd aqualntances; may he con-
t i n u e t o unburden h i m s e l f on t o us. A t h i r d short
s t o r y , "Sales T a l k ' j Is understandably anonymous.
There are two poems i n t h i s i s s u e : Roger
W i l l i a m chooses the t r i t e theme of the power of the
Imagination to transcend circumstances, but h i s very
t h o u g h t f u l work demands more lengthy c r i t i c i s m than .
Is appropriate In t h i s column. Ray Bonnet's
"Baghdad" bears many marks of t h i s century; I would
have enjoyed i t more w i t h a few l e s s . ( I r e f e r
p a r t i c u l a r l y to the i r r i t a t i n g a f f e c t a t i o n of a
succession of repeated p a i r s , as i n "A raucoua
song, a n a t i v e ' s song".) Poems of the q u a l i t y o f
these two do not o f t e n appear i n Phoenix.
John Cox, i n "Science and the Devlopment of
S o c i e t y " produces i n t e r e s t i n g s t a t i s t i c s on the pro-
p o r t i o n s and numbers of s c i e n t i s t s i n the World
Powers, and skims l i g h t l y over h i s the surface of
the t o p i c he has chosen f o r h i s t i t l e . I t would
be b e t t e r t r e a t e d at greater l e n g t h . Acland Essay
a s p i r a n t s may l i k e to note the i d e a l subject.
There are a number of other a r t i c l e s i n t h i s
Phoenix, i n c l u d i n g the A.C.C, Review (thankless
task, but w e l l done), but as they are e i t h e r un-
pretentious and u n l l t e r a r y r e p o r t s , or are by non-
students, they do not p r o p e r l y f a l l v/lthin the scope
of t h i s a r t i c l e . There i s a l s o the usual book
review ( Inorganic A n a l y s i s ), which ought not t o
be there. ( Who gets a f r e e copy anyway? )
Having recorded an honest oppinion of some of
the contents of- the l a t e s t Phoenix, f o r which I will
presumably pay by the l o s s of a few more f r i e n d s
and the r e c l e p t of some nasty l e t t e r s , I must add
that I consider t h i s the best Phoenix I have r e -
viewed, ( i t i s the s i x t h ) , and i s w e l l worth the
cost. On t h i s l a s t p o i n t , congratulations to the
E d i t r e s s , who has beaten a l l her predecessors.
