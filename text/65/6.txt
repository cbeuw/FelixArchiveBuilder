NEOLITHIC REVIVAL AT (SlQWOOD-HENGE
At half-past four on one July morning (sun-
r i s e ) , a rousing Boomalaka before Silwood House
marked tne completion of the quickest erection i n
anolent-temple-buildlng history. For there on
the h i l l s i d e , under the admiring gaze of a herd
of prehistorio oows (who were seen later that
morning paying homage to TRYIN - the -henge god
of examinations), stood Wood-henge b u i l t by the
-hengists to the memory of the 1st Year C i v i l e
who f e l l i n the part I struggles of 1954. (SIC
RiiPENTIT) Near olosing-time, the previous
evening, under the oheerful auspices of "The
Thatched Tavern", the GRAND PLAN (formed by the
-henge aroh-druids) was explained to the Neo-
lithioan plebs. The aroh-druids having already
"found" tools and materials, they led each party
of serfs to their alloted tasks. Ancient
British Railway sleepers (authentically used by
Boadioea's train and mentioned i n "the
book of primitive transport") were kindly "pro-
vided" by the Silwood Park Authorities, there
being l i t t l e native hewing-stone available.
(See Druid's handbook, block IX, para. V on
"-henge building, serfs, for the use of".)
Aborigines from Welsh and Afrioan colonies
had been imported to build the altar f o r whioh
there was a small quantity of natural rook (or
Portland cement). These master craftsmen
showed great aptitude for their task and were
later oonferred with the order of the'Wode (the
highest -hengeman award). After s i x weary
hours of t o i l , the -henge was completed and the
service of dedioation performed (after the style
of the 2nd f l o o r memorial originated by the
'-hengists i n the Tillage of Cloohmerle, France).
As an aot of supplication f o r the downfalien an
Anoient B r i t i s h spanner (primitive tool) was
embedded i n the a l t a r .
