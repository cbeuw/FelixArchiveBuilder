Opinion
Manning the Martello Towers
Dear Editor,
I was delighted to see several
mentions of the Queen's English
Society in Felix 948. The writer of
Beit Back, however, appears to
know very little about the QES or
its aims. Far from being a body of
men, we have many female
members, including our chairman.
We have never claimed to be an
intellectual elite; our members
include manual workers as well as
professionally-qualified people. The
Beiter's comment about black
Americans not counting was in poor
taste. Our members include 'blacks'
and 'whites', Britons, Germans,
Americans, Sri Lankans,
Australians, etc. The Society's
name, on which Beiter appears to
base most of his or her conclusions,
is part of a Shakespearean
quotation.
The massive publicity to which
your correspondent refers did not
come from naive statements
lamenting the standards of grammar
in our universities; they would be
of little interest to the media, which
prefer facts. The publicity came
mainly from my 64-page book, ' A
National Survey of U K
Undergraduates' Standards of
English', published by the QES at
£3.00, available from the College
Bookstore and from me.
This book was based on a
scientific survey of 17 U K
universities or colleges, with a
51.5% return of 336 questionnaires,

• LADIES with an attitude. Are
you interested in joining a piss-up
club vaguely along the same lines
with answers from 148
departments, and a detailed study of
one department to assess the range
of staff opinions on the same group
of students. Far from being
confined to grammar, the study
included spelling, punctuation,
handwriting, vocabulary, and
clarity of written and spoken
expression. As well as containing
a mass of data which the press
obviously found interesting, the
book quotes extensively from
comments made by those returning
the questionnaires, whether I agreed
with their comments or not. The
study provided firm evidence on
which to base discussions as to what
should or should not be done about
English teaching in schools and
universities.
My article in the summer edition
of Felix was written at the editor's
request, and included reasons why
good English is helpful to students
and why bad English can be
harmful. There were examples of
faults to be aware of, and how to
avoid them. The staff member who
spotted 'Youthenasia' in a student's
essay certainly did not think it was
a pun; it has given pleasure to many
people, but I would caution against
using anything which might be
misinterpreted as ignorance in
formal essays.
We have never said that English
should conform to 'a standardized
and rigorous formula'. Different
kinds of language, including highly
as the men's ones? (Ask any
member what they get up tb!) To
get Union funding we need
signatures. Contact Vicky Clarke,
Physics 3. Ideas for club name,
what to do etc are welcome.

colloquial forms, are appropriate to
different contexts. For example, my
stories In a Cavern (Phoenix 1984)
and The Wheels of Fate (Phoenix
1976) are both in 'uneducated
American' dialects. Like many of
our members, I enjoy regional
accents and dialects. They are fine
for local purposes, but for general
communication nationally and
internationally, a single general
form of a language is best
understood and usable by all. It
would be absurd and dangerous if
a foreign airline pilot had to cope
with an incomprehensible (to
outsiders) local dialect when being
'talked down' at our airports. A
single standard form is best, which
for us, for historical reasons, is
Standard English with Received
Pronunciation. Beiter is quite wrong
to assume that we want everyone to
use these all the time.
According to our policy
document, the main aims of The
Queen's English Society are: to
encourage high standards of
education in English in the United
Kingdom; to promote literacy, and
knowledge, understanding and
appreciation of our rich language;
to monitor and to try to improve the
standards of English used in the
public media; to discourage
slovenly usage and the intrusion of
anything detrimental to clarity or
euphony. Some members try to help
locally, for example hearing young
children read or working

Thursday 26th November:
'Engineering and Management

attend. No need to book—just turn
voluntarily in hospital libraries.
Others take part in regional or
national campaigns, or do relevant
research.
Although I admire Beiter's
imagery of members manning
Martello Towers, we do not oppose
most linguistic changes or imports,
only ones which we feel are ugly or
which lead to misunderstanding and
lack of precision. I would not like
to see the American 'elevator'
replacing the simple British 'lift',
or to have the useful distinction lost
between 'to effect' (completely
bring about) and 'to affect' (have
some influence on), for example. At
a recent London Branch meeting,
members brought examples of
good, enjoyable English to share.
I read the poem 'One' by IC
Postgraduate Allan Hui, from the
1992 Phoenix, showing that our
students can write excellent
imaginative English.
Yes, Beiter's article was written
in reasonably good English, except
for 'it's' as a possessive pronoun,
but well-constructed arguments
should be based on facts, not on
wildly inaccurate suppositions. He
or she would be welcome in my
office to see our society's policy
document, to get the real facts - and
even a membership form!
Yours sincerely,
Dr Bernard Lamb
Committee Member of the Queen's
English Society, and Chairman of
