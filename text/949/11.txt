Attitudes To Be Proud Of?
In The Past
Racism is a bad thing. To most of
you this is going to seem a pretty
obvious statement, but only thirty
years ago, people in this country
and elsewhere were struggling for
legislation that would acknowledge
this. In yesterday's society the fact
that there is a basic human dignity,
regardless of colour or race, was
denied. Racism and bigotry were
seen to be an implicit part of human
nature, and those individuals who
were trying to change this
perception were seen to be idealistic
and naive.
In The Present
It would be wrong to say that
racism no longer plays a part in our
society, but what I would like to
suggest is that we now recognise
that bigotry is taught. People are not
born racists or bigots, and when we
recognise racist attitudes within
ourselves it is not something we are
proud of.
In The Future
What I'd like people to realise is
that the idealists of today's society,
those who have the guts to stand up
for what they believe in, are going
to change the way of the world. I'm
tired of listening to the cynics who
insist that nothing ever changes, and
if it does, then it's not because of
the likes of us. They're wrong. We
are in an ever changing world, and
things only ever improve because
of individuals who become aware
of an injustice, and set about, in
their own small way, to right a
wrong. This has been shown to be
true time and time again over many
generations. Nothing positive has
ever been achieved through
cynicism and apathy.
Time For A Change
We belong to a national student's
movement called Third World
First. Together with groups in
universities and colleges throughout
Britain, we campaign against the
root causes of poverty. We
recognise that the legacy of
colonialism, unequal terms of trade,
the enormous burden of debt and
environmental degradation all
contribute to ensure that the poor
are getting poorer. At the moment
it is dictated that the price we pay
for our comfort is in terms of
human misery. We say that greed
is an implicit part of human nature.
That may be so, but I think the time
has come to stop applauding the
greedy and to recognise that greed
is a bad thing.
We say that greed is an
implicit part of human
nature ... but the time
has come to stop
applauding the greedy
and to recognise that
greed is a bad thing.
Come along to one of our meetings in Southside Upper Lounge at lpm
on Fridays. We also hold regular speaker meetings and show videos in
the Clubs Committee Room (topfloor ofthe Union Building) at lunchtimes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
