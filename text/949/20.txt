La Muse de Montparnasse
Tucked away above a lovely pub,
chairs, tables, ashtrays, candles and
flowers evoke the pre-war cafe bar
atmosphere that is the setting for
this revue of 30's songs from Piaf
and Trenet to Porter and Coward.
The three singers recreated, through
some amateurish acting, the hey-
day of the romantic ballad. The
main complaint was a simian
•epidemic of dead arm syndrome and
a painful French accent care of
'Miss Cheekbones' (Georgia
Dobson).
Some competent and engaging
singing overrode any remaining
misgivings. Director Saskia Bosch's
rich, husky voice and coquettish
veiled looks captured perfectly the
inate sensuality of the genre.
Sensitive piano and accordion
accompaniment completed the
touchingly nostalgic sound. If you
like these wonderful songs from the
golden era of songwriting, you'll
love this.

The News Review
At this point (other than having
another drink) stay put for the
longest running news review in the
country. This break-neck amalgam
of sketches, monologues and songs
is hysterical. Watch out Spitting
Image and Weekending here is
serious talent.
Delectable morsels such as an
uncanny John Major singing 'I've
f***ed the economy' and Charles
and Di paying a visit to the 'Barry
White marriage guidance service'
('Is it some sort of luuurve problem,
children?') are but two of a myriad
of wacky, witty, incisive numbers
that had the packed theatre
convulsed. Must-see-stuff.

Torquemada
In the year 1492, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue... It's a church. It's
a church. Hey, what great
acoustics. This is getting very
weird; 5 minutes in and I don't
understand it. Still, I'm not alone.
No-one else here does either. Oh,
revelation. It's an introduction.
Torquemada was an old Spanish
monk who got buried alive, was
La Muse de Montparnasse.
rescued and went on to head the
Spainsh Inquistion (Yeah, yeah, I
know, everyone expects the Monty
Python gag). This is the first
English translation of Victor
Hugo's last play, thankfully edited
down from it's original five hour
script, to round about two hours.
Heavy stuff, but most enjoyable. I
almost forgot I wasn't in medieval
Spain for a moment.

The Diary of a Madman
I have a basic problem with this
premise, and indeed, these
premises; how one is to appreciate
the soulless, clerk-eating monster
that is 19th century St Petersburg
in the Cafe Theatre in Covent
Garden is beyond me, and quite
evidently beyond the theatre. Yes,
I had reservations, but it was
GOGOL, the godhead, the singer of
the soul of all Russia. I couldn't
resist.
The difficulty in translating
Gogol to a medium like theatre is
that the gorgeous black comedy, the
pathos, the scrawny, mean sense of
oppression is lacking when the
magnitude of the locale is missing.
Aside from Dostoevsky, none other
than Gogol has so beautifully and
skilfully woven an atmosphere of
exquisite suggestion, smothering
their characters in the fine threads
of narrow-chested misery and
rheumatic stoicism. I would love to
say that this works; I would never
be away from this theatre if it was
so, but the representation is as
clumsy as expected, it is virtually
impossible to avoid being so. In this
respect, I can't say that it is
disappointing; I can say that it is a
failure.

The Complete Works of
Shakespeare
One of the funniest plays I have
seen. Although claiming to perform
all 37 of Shakespeare's plays in two
hours could bode ill—pretentious
in-jokes and other literary tortures.
The Reduced Shakespeare
Company avoids any attempt to
please the intelligensia. Moving at
a breakneck pace, the three
'players' move swiftly through the
Bard's greatest works with a
consistent flood of humour, in both
real and parodied Shakespeare.
Madcap mime and action threaten
chaos as they race around the stage,
props flying. The acting throughout
is excellent and often descends to
delightfully cheap tricks to get a
laugh (e.g. Shakespeare's
biography—T love my Willy').
Never conventional, at times
reminiscent of pantomime with
audience participation and the
auditorium frequently invaded by
the cast keep the theatre buzzing.
Anyway, who could have thought
a Shakespeare play could contain
fire-eating and accordian playing?
Any bad points? Great fans of
Russian playwrights will hate it, as
will your old English teacher. Don't
be put off if you don't know any of
Shakespeare's works—in fact it's a
bonus! It's got an extended run, but
hurry—tickets will move as fast as
the dialogue.

The Duchess of Malfi
Webster's 'Duchess of Malfi' has
a plot that Hitchcock would be
proud to claim as his own. Intrigue
within intrigue, greed, jealosy and
murder are just part of this
Renaissance play. The widowed
Duchess, having been forbidden to
remarry by her two evil brothers,
Ferdinand and the Cardinal, pays
dearly when it is finally revealed
that she has secretly married the
household accountant, Antonio.
Nigel Daly plays a brilliantly
conniving, but almost likeable,
Bosola—the instrument of the
brothers in their evil plots. Lorna
Phillips (Julia) provides a few
amusing asides whilst trying to
seduce the Cardinal and Bosola.
However, the impact of the final
scene of the play (leaving us
ominously with four corpses on-
stage and a couple more off-stage)
is somewhat undermined by over
zealous acting. Unfortunately the
real tragedy of this ending was that
the audience laughed. This could
perhaps be remedied by slightly
quieter, quicker deaths on the parts
of the Cardinal and Ferdinand (I
was reminded of Bottom's
Pyramus, 'A Midsummer's Night
Dream).
Despite this, an interesting
production with potential.
