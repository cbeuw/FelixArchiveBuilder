This winter there will be hundreds
of thousands of children in Croatia
and Bosnia-Herzogovina without
homes, food or their parents. For
you Christmas is a time to look
forward toâ€”for these children, it
will be a time of loneliness, sadness
and bitter cold.
Snow is already covering the
mountains and ice coats the roads
each morning. United Nations
officials estimate that at least
400,000 will die in Bosnia from the
cold.
This winter
there will be
thousands of
children in
Croatia without
homes, food or
their parents.
The fighting is closing air and
ground supply routes and it seems
that the race to bring food, fuel,
clothes and medicines into Sarajevo
before winter sets in is being lost.
We desperately need your help.
Between November 24th and
December 10th, trucks will be
leaving the U K to deliver medical
supplies, food and warm clothes,
along with toys and 'shoe-box gifts'
from children in the UK. We really
need to count on something from
you to be on these trucks. Please let
us help by sending them small
Christmas presents. Maybe you

yourself or a younger brother or
sister could put together a shoe box,

decorate it, and enclose a toy or gift
(in good condition). Then, attach a
note indicating who it would be
most suitable for, eg a five year old
boy, ten year old girl. If you could
! also put in socks, pens, paper,
scarves, mittens, sweets, etc. In fact
anything that would give a child
pleasure if he/she were opening it.
Then you could write your name on
the inside of box with a message for
a 'Happy Christmas', translated as
'Sretan Bozic' in Croatian.
Please bring your donations to the
Imperial College Union Office
labelled 'Franka-'s Fund'. If you

21 February 1991:
In its first step towards
independence, the Yugoslav
republic of Croatia declares its laws
to be above federal laws made in the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. Croatia
was following the example set by
sister republic, Slovenia. Both
republics had already threatened to
break away from the Yugoslavian
federation unless other republics,
especially Serbia, agreed to
transform the country into a loose
confederation.
15 March 1991:
Borisav Jovic, a hardline Serb,
resigns as head of Yugoslavia's
collective presidency. A military
coup is feared.
2 May 1991:
Several people are killed as clashes
begin between Croatian police and
Serbian paramilitary groups. Croats
accused the Serb dominated federal
army of failing to protect them.
5 May 1991:
A big anti-army demonstration is
held in Split.
15 May 1991:
The Yugoslav presidency should
have rotated to Croatia, but the
election is blocked by Serbia,
leaving Yugoslavia without a Head
of State or Commander in Chief for
its armed forces.
19 May 1991:
A referendum in Croatia showed
that 94% of voters wanted Croatian
sovereignty within a looser
Yugoslavia. 92% were against
staying in Yugoslavia in its present
form.
25 June 1991:
Slovenia and Croatia declared their
independence. Two days later the
Yugoslav federal army intervened,
recapturing Slovenian border posts
but getting cut off in the process.
E C leaders, meeting in
Luxembourg, dispatched a group
(troika) of foreign ministers to
mediate a ceasefire. A Croat is
elected to the Yugoslav presidency.
The fighting continues.
