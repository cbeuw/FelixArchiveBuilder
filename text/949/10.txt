The London Film Festival
Simon Su and David Spooner peruse the delights offered this year, and
recommend the best of the capitals annual movie gala.
The London Film Festival
The 36th London Film Festival will
be, at the time of your reading this,
an event halfway through its tenure.
Now, please; do not be
discouraged, because this should
not dissuade you from attending the
remaining excellent features.
The festival is, of course,
categorised in different sections; the
'Film on the Square' section, for
example, is comprised of generally
mainstream features, presumably to
justify its place in Leicester Square.
Herein, then, two Bob De Niro
flicks- 'Mistress' and 'Night and the
City'- and two Whoopie Goldberg
flicks- to whit, 'Sarafina' and
'Sister Act', the latter seeing La
Goldberg as 'an undercover cop in
disguise as a nun'... events ensue
with, no doubt, hilarious
consequences...
From the comfy sitcommy stuff,
to the Highbrow, or perhaps not.
Alan Rudolph returns after the
acclaim of 'The Moderns', with a
film called 'Equinox', and Bruce
Beresford brings to our attention his
latest effort, 'Rich in Love' with
Albert Finney. The hallowed name
of Ridley Scott (bow, close eyes and
intone darkly in homage) makes
itself once more accessible with his
ever-so-slight re-working of
' B L A D E R U N N E R ' ! ! ! Rest
assured, dear reader, we shan't
spoil it for you. Gits won't let us
see it, will they? Still,
' B L A D E R U N N E R ' ! ! ! goes on
general release in the next few
months, as does the rest of this
bounteous celluloid output.
With a quip, and a skip, and a
merry heave-ho, we look next at the
'U.S. Independents' section; the
phrase here is 'up-and-coming',
don'tcha know, kids. So, yeah,
check out Joel Hershman's first
feature 'Hold me, Thrill me, Kiss
me', described as 'Almodovar and
John Waters teaming up on a 90's
love story'. Carl Franklin, a black
American director makes his debut
with 'One False Move', an
apparently subtle exploration of
sexual and racial relationships. Of
Blade Runner, the directors cut.
particular interest, 'The Living
End', described as 'An alternative
Thelma & Louise', and involving
two HIV-positive boys escaping
their rather terminal situation in a
gleeful voyage into sex, violence,
and indulgence. A somewhat
offbeat, but nonetheless, interesting
addition to the festival.
Dear old Sir Kenny O'Lovey, Mr
Branagh to the rest of you, has his
latest work 'Peter's Friends' also on
show, and those stalwart
workhorses Julie Walters, Jeanne
Moreau, and Mrs Olivier herself,
Joan Plowright, will be dead certs
for plum performances in 'The
Clothes in the Wardrobe'. A
Hellraiser 3
documentary, entitled 'The
Execution Protocol', follows the
lives of three convicted murderers,
one of whom came pretty close to
meeting his maker. Who said the
British Film Industry was dead,
eh?.
Moving on, now, to films from
all over the world, and a fair
selection of famous names we have
here. Eric Rohmer, Jean-Jacques
Beineix, Claude Chabrol and
Luchino Visconti amongst others.
Some forty other films from
Europe, twenty from Asia, and a
further ten from Africa are
featured. Zhang Yimou, a festival
fave from China, has his latest
offering, 'The Story of Qui Ju'
included in this year's presentation.
This film has already claimed the
Golden Lion and 'Best Actress'
award at the Venice Film Festival.
Carmen Maura, European Actress
of 1990, makes her debut in French
film called 'On Earth as in Heaven'.
Big names aside, be adventurous;
all 'big names' were 'unknowns' to
begin with.
As if that wasn't enough, Mike
Leigh directs the festival trailer; this
he did last year, and was a rare old
mirth-filled ribtickler. Happy
Viewing.
