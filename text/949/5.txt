Cat's Eyes
Quote from Paul Thomas, RCSU
President 1992-93: '...Jonty is
entitled to his opinions and who am
I to tell him what to put in Felix?'
Too fucking right! Since when do
the presidents of the CCU's have
the power to tell the Felix editor
what to print? O K so he gets up
tight about the avalanche of crap
associated with mascotry that
forever finds its way into the Felix
office, we all do. I suppose we
could destroy it before it reaches
hirn and claim that we lost it
because it is so hectic in Felix and
the place is swarming with people
during the day, (a situation N E V E R
encountered in the RCS office).
The Chancellor (or incompetent
dickhead as his title should be),
gave his autumn speech last
Thursday and promised a whole
lorry load of improvements that are
needed to boost the economy.
Among the lies was the promise to
decrease the public spending on the
Dept of Education. Somehow I
think he will keep this promise. But
fair's fair, he has promised to raise
benefits in line with inflation, (an
extra 3.9%, oooh).
Barbara Bates, a self-confessed
tyrant and president of Birkbeck
College Students' Union claims that
students have waged a personal
vendetta against her. If she insists
on flaunting the fact that she
'.. .trained at R A D A . . . ' and is '.. .an
actress by profession...', then it is
no surprise that any student would
want to wage a vendetta against
such a pompous, big-headed, self-
appraising cow! I bet she can't even
act and only uses the fact that
R A D A were stupid enough to let
her in as something to put on her
CV (in the list of her qualifications,
after the A-level in Pride and
Haughtiness and her degree in
Snobbery and the Art of Appearing
as the World's most Pretentious
Human).
The whole idea of the meetings in
the Ents lounge on Mondays is to
meet Chris Davidson (Ben from the
Bill+Ben posse) and to chat to him
informally about anything. I
assumed that Chris would be mainly
talking about the proposed split with
the University of London and
voluntary membership of the
Union, but the real high point was
when he was answering all manner
of questions about his 'hip and
happ'nin" haircut. As well as
bragging about it immensely, he
strongly denied being sponsored for
Felix 949
the haircut and diverted that line of
questioning to the fact that the
hairdresser has sponsored him for
the Bungee Jump. Somehow I think
these meetings are not fulfilling
their original purpose, especially
since half of the assembled crowd
were there as it was the nearest
place to sit and eat, rather than to
see the pressies' new hair.
According to this week's Time Out,
there are half a million young,
single women in London. O.K., I
give up. Where the fuck are they?
I don't dispute that their figures are
correct but nowhere in the three
page article do they state where in
London these half a million hiding.
Time Out suggest to try the
National Portrait Gallery which
boasts that 63% of their lecture
devotees are women, although they
seem to think that the self-service
salad bar of the local branch of
Sainsbury is a more likely place to
meet Mrs. Right (although at the
same time she will be looking for
Mr. Right). They also strongly
advise that Thursday and Saturday
are the best days to try. Please!
Top Gear really pisses me off. I
think it is very sad that the B B C
have dedicated half an hour to car
enthusiasts and completely ignore
sex maniacs! It makes me want to
Opinion
20 November 1992
puke seeing overpaid presenters
fulfilling their dreams by driving a
bloody expensive car and trying to
describe to us peasants what it 'feels
like'. No doubt that loyal watchers
drool more at the sight of a turbo-
charged engine with a twin cam-
shaft than at the programme's only
female presenter. Therefore it is fair
to say that Top Gear is for the sad
if not twisted members of the
British public who find driving a car
more exhilarating than having sex.
The other part of the programme
I hate is the hysterical manner in
which the two male senile old farts,
oops I mean the two male
presenters, parade around and
inside the cars in a pathetic effort
to describe everything from the seat
covers (very important!) to the 'feel
of the gear-stick'. Having said that,
I think that they probably get more
excitement from feeling a gear-stick
than something very similar. These
people should definitely have been
committed to a funny farm years
ago.

Apologies to anyone I have been groggy with
