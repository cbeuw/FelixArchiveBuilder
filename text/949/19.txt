Hard Boiled Weapon and the indestructable breathtaking and hectic verging on storyline are pretty lame but has that
Hard Boiled is a Hong Kong Robocop. In typical Chinese the ludicrous. As in the Hollywood stopped us from shelling out
version of Die Hard, Lethal tradition the action scenes are blockbusters the acting and millions for each of them.

Social Worker saves baby from being 'Hard Boiled'
Schtonk
The title of this comedy translates
as 'trouble' and abundant it is too
in this satirical look at the
publication of the so-called Hitler
diaries.
Directed and produced by
prominent German director Helmut
Dietl, this comedy acquits itself
well, allowing for German humour
leads him to a chance meeting with
Hermann resulting in the genesis of
his most monumental fake to date:
The Fiihrer Diaries.
Hermann desperately seeking a
scoop to salvage his journalistic
career, offers to buy the diaries at
any price, with the backing of his
employers and so commences the
fun and frolics.
Sunday's Children
This film is from a script by Ingmar
Bergmann, but directed by his son
Daniel. Ingmar wasn't allowed on
the set. It's about his boyhood,
when he was nine. It's a wonderful
film about childhood and
relationships with parents (not just
the mother!), and all this in a
beautiful Swedish summer.

Cloud —Heaven
A nice Sunday in a village some
distance from Moscow. Kolja
enrages everybody with his
comments on the weather. In order
not to bore his only friend, he tells
him he's leaving town since he has
been invited to the Far East.
Unfortunately, they believe him,
and he has to go on the same
evening.

Film
I'd go for the one with the BIG...
and the subtitles.
Schtonk centres around two
characters in the Hider diaries saga;
the forger, opportunist and genius
Professor Dr Fritz Knobel and
Harmann, a glory seeking
journalist.
Multi-talented Fritz (a Michael
Keaton look-alike) makes his living
by selling Hitler relics of his own
devising to gullible aristocrats. This
The humour is on a light-hearted
slapstick level, but the film manages
to remain on an intelligent footing.
An operatic German score, a
sprinkling of busty women and
quick lively direction manage to
sustain one's interest.
Only recommended for non-
mainstream film enthusiasts.

Single White Female
Bridget Fonda makes a name for
herself in Single White Female as
a yuppie-type career girl who after
kicking her lover out of her flat for
sleeping with ex, advertises for a
flatmate. Enter Jennifer Jason Leigh
who plays the slightly immature
Hedy who turns out to be a female
version of Norman Bates, except
there are no showers here, only a
flat in a yuppie-esque type building.
Some have said that this film is
just another The Hand That Rocks
The Cradle while others claim it to
be a bloody good thriller. I agree
that it is a good thriller but since
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle
was excellent, its hard not to
compare any thriller that contains
a women psycho to it.
This film ends up into ludicrous
excess as it nears the end but it is
not for anyone who has a flatmate
from hell.
