Barrel Of Laughs For A Barrel Of Beer
So it finally happened. After weeks
of secrecy and careful planning, the
Halls Dirty Dozen competition was
upon us. This was the event where
you decided what you wanted to do
and we just helped you along. And
did you come up with some crazy
ideas? We had teams dancing in the
streets, St Trinian's running
around, slaves on the loose, teams
in London, Colchester, Guildford
and Little Hampton and everybody
'doing it' for charity.
The results of the day were
happily surprising with £4,033.43
being raised for various charities.
The top team and winners of the
barrel of beer were Falmouth
Keogh who managed to raise a
staggering sum of £1419.25 for
Cystic Fibrosis.
For those of you with more than
a passing interest in this article I
record here for posterity a brief
summary of the events of the day
from the point of view of each team.
1st - Falmouth Keogh
In search of a healthier environment
our team pushed off to Guildford to
do a spot of collecting for Cystic
Fibrosis. Our six hours licensed
collecting time was well used,
despite attempts by the incessant
rain to dampen our spirits and we
managed to collect about £1400.
2nd - Southwell
We thought it would be ingenious
to go out collecting in drag and ask
people for money in exchange for
sexual favours. Yes, that's right,
we're the team who went out as St
Trinians. We stopped for a Burger
King meal (with no onions and extra
ketchup, thankyou very much) and
•met Anthony Hopkins along the
way. Final total: an amazing
£574.33 for Amnesty International.
3rd - Fisher
Having finally decided to go to
Little Hampton, Arundel and
Rushton to collect for BIBIC, we
got to see a castle and wander
around some very nice old
fashioned towns in the rain. The
news that we had collected £514.93
was very welcome, when we
returned home cold and soggy.
4th - Garden
Our Dirty Dozen was slightly
depleted due fo a sore toothy-peg
(aahhh). Not to be deterred, the rest
of us braved various tetanus
infections as we stumbled round
London chained up like slaves,
harassing tourists into coughing up
for Amnesty International. At the
end of the day, we handed over the
magnificent sum of £422.10.
5th - Tizard, Linstead, Selkirk
A joint team, because each of our
hall's individual teams were sadly
lacking in numbers. We hit
Colchester to try our luck in
collecting for WAIFS, an animal
welfare charity. Despite harsh
wintry conditions, our combined
team of only nine people still
managed to collect £411.
6th - Weeks
The Halls Dirty Half Dozen, more
like, from us. Not that we didn't
prove our worth, though. Silly ideas
abounded, namely playing Twister
outside Buckingham Palace and
doing John Cleese style silly walks
round Eros. We also raided all the
other rival halls and collected there
too! Total sum: £ 2 9 8 . 3 1 to
A m n e s t y .
7th - Willis Jackson
OK, so we didn't raise a fortune,
but we raised a few laughs and
Halls competition
Willis Jackson £17.08
Falmouth Keogh £13.05
Garden £12.44
Linstead £10.70
Weeks £8.80
Fisher £8.08
Tizard £6.92
Southwell £6.89
Selkirk £3.22
Bernard Sunley £2.34
that's got to be worth something.
We did party dances around
London which included the
Locomotion in Leicester Square,
The Can-Can in Carnaby Street,
and the Hokey Kokey in Piccadilly
Circus. In between dances, we still
managed to raise £254.42 for
Amnesty.
8th - Bernard Sunley
We started at Covent Garden and
on the way there lost two collectors.
The mystery deepened with the
gradual loss of four more collectors
near Neal Street and we alone
survived to tell this harrowing tale
of cold, sleet, snow, massive tidal
BoingM!
waves, volcanoes, prehistoric
beasts and, of course, mad
depraved collector-hunters. PS. We
raised £140.11!
So well done to all you wonderful
people - Bruce McKee was the top
collector managing to separate £192
from their owners and the wackiest
exploits of the event were decided
to be the party dances round
London by Willis Jackson. Due to
both the success and overwhelming
response to this, the first annual
Halls Dirty Dozen competition, we
are planning to hold another one
(The Return!) at the end of next
term so get scheming.
This weekend will see a group of
over thirty Raggies taking their life
into their hands for UNICEF. Yes,
once again R A G are risking life and
limb and doing sponsored bungee
jumping. An experience compared
by many people to sex, involving
a low level, elastically retarded
freefall almost two hundred feet
from a crane in central London.
You need to be certifiable to do one
but you'd be crazy not to.
Our team of leapers will be
jumping at London's first
permanent bungee jump site in
Putney on Saturday morning (tube
to Putney Bridge, cross river, jump
site on left). If you fancy coming
along and giving us a bit of support,
moral or otherwise please come and
join us. We will be meeting at
college at 11.00am and we start
jumping at midday. We have people
jumping in fancy dress, wheelchairs
(honest guv!) and one brave person
intends to jump in the nude.
Promises to be a great day out for
all the family!
Be Mad! Be Silly!
Be Part Of It!
