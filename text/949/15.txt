The 4 of Us, The Lost Soul
Band—Clapham Grand
After finding my way to the
Clapham Grand in the car (not easy
and I don't advise it), I settled down
in a corner, drink in hand and
listened to the band. This being The
Lost Soul Band—a Scottish band
who have absolutely nothing in
common with The Waterboys, so I
won't mention them (oops, too
late!).
Gordon Grahame (lead singer)
was being silly Miles Hunt-esque
type bod, during the set and
generally ensured he had a good
time, which, as usual, helps the
audience enjoy themselves.
The set was good and one of the
high spots was 'Trashscene' which
is their next single. Excellent live,
it's translated well in the studio (and
most of the other tracks on the 12"
are worthy too). Considering he
only learnt to play electric guitar
since joining the band Gordon
Grahame was being a bit flash,
changing guitars for just about
every song.
Next, half hour of drinking
then...
.The 4 of Us. They hopped onto
Felix 949
Singles
Sweet Jesus—Albino
Ballerina/Your Baby Loves
Me
This is actually rather good. A 'live
favourite' I'm reliably informed by
the nice press people. Is that realy
important? But somehow there is
something missing. I know, why
don't they give away a piece of Ben
Bendey's satin shirts. The sales will
rocket.

Malaika—So Much Love
A classic garage anthem much in
the same vein as Ce Ce Peniston's
'Finally'. In fact, Malaika does a
better job of sounding like Ce Ce
than she herself does nowadays. A
cheesy piano riff, a deep soulful
vocal and, of course, the ubiquitous
pre-set strings. With all the bits in
the right places, this record is
nothing new, but it works. The
remix is given extra spice by the
man-like Morales. Check out the
US import for the Sasha endorsed
Techno version.

stage and burst into 'Baby Jesus'
and all the 'hard core' fans down
the front went wild—the rest of us
were either too mellow or too
drunk.
The first half of the set comprised
of songs from their new album
whilst the second half was mainly
old songs.
The best song in the set was
definitely 'Love, Hate & Hope',
from the new album—very frenetic.
'Man Alive' was excellent live, but
for some strange reason the intro to
it sounded like 'Justify My Love'
by Madonna...too much alcohol, I
suppose.
Brendan Murphy is cooool! A bit
drunk, but still definitely cool.
Taking some time to explain some
of the songs to those of us not
cynical enough about life already
was a good move. A sense of the
quixotic was our friend
Brendan...pity he can't dance
though.
Anyway—excellent relaxed
gig—see them if you can.

•'Thrashscene' on Silvertone.
'Man Alive' on Columbia/Sony.
Kingmaker —Paradise Club
This is a different band to the one
I saw in the spring of 91. Gone is
the self-conscious schoolboy
frontman , and in his place an Elvis
Costello style 70's reject, complete
with frilly pink shirt from hell.
The new found confidence is
probably the reason behind the
more forgettable components of the
set. People just aren't coming up
and saying 'Loz, that was Kak!',
either that or he just isn't listening
any more.
Having said that, most of the new
Lawnmower Deth—Marquee
14.11.92
I have been informed that the shit
band I saw play two songs after my
late entry to the Marquee were
Innerstate, which surprises me
because I have heard good things
about that band.
After a lengthy intro-type-and-
light-show affair, the Fabulous
Metal Bozo Clowns took the stage,
and an hour or so of extreme
stupidity followed. If you have
never experienced Lawnmower
Deth at their best, then I could
never possibly describe the
proceedings.
The band played several songs
from the drum mixer as the stage
Carter USM—The
Impossible Dream
Surely the final release from '1992'
(the album, not the year: We are
approaching Christmas, and I'm
beginning to smell it in the subject
matter this week.) as there are only
a couple left with any chance of
radio playlisting. They can't really
expect to get radio play with lyrics
like 'come along you fucking
sadist', now can they?. None of that
here, mind, because 'The
Impossible Dream' is a, shhh, cover
version. And very nice it is too.
What it really needs is a sort of
jingle bells sound in the
background. Or maybe a choir
singing. I knew it was Christmas.
Turn it over, I think. Ooh. Look at
that. Good B-side shock, and lots
of them (On C D and 12" only, 7"
fans). 'Turn On, Tune In & Switch
Off seems to indicate that Carter's
US Tourbus had cable installed.
(Hmmm, I wonder how they did
that). I like it. The other two are
OK. (Does that sound like a
put-down?)

material is inspired genius - the now
banned 'Armchair Anarchist' being
a case in point.
The good songs backed up by
album tracks and earlier material
turned what might have been a
serious pile of shite into the original
razor sharp performance we have
come to expect from a top band like
this.
My advice would be; stop
hanging around with Miles Hunt
and dedicating songs to Carter. Go
back to Hull and play for people
who throw toasters at you if you're
no good.

^Kingmaker's 'Armchair
Anarchist' might still be in a few
shops, on Chrysalis.
was too full of stagedivers and
general loonies for the
Lawnmowers to find anywhere to
stand. Some girl stole a microphone
and appointed herself backing
vocalist for the evening.
Newish guitarist Baron Kev Von
Thresh Moister Silo Stench Chisel
Marbels—ne Kev from Acid Reign,
seems to have added a new
dimension of musicianship to the
band, who actually played some
good Thrash, but does that excuse
his pink lycra miniskirt? Or his
stripping down to Y-fronts and Doc
Martens for the encore? Probably.

*Innerstate's 'A Tell-Tale Trail'
on Roadracer.
Soundgarden—Outshined
Another Seattle band.. .NOT! They
aren't on the Nirvana bandwagon,
they've been around for ages and
'Outshined' is a testament to this.
It's a little stale but not that bad
(well not as bad as half the stuff in
the charts but that's not saying
much).
The B-side is a cover of T Can't
Give You Anything', by The
Ramones and is excellent if you
don't compare it to the original.
.This is a mixture of mediocre and
good from Soundgarden.
