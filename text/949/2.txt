Birkbeck President fights back
by Gareth Light
Barbara Bates, the president of
Birkbeck College Students' Union,
faced down a motion of no
confidence yesterday. The motion
was tabled by David Gascoigne, a
PhD crystallography student, who
accused Ms Bates of incompetence
and irresponsible financial practice.
Mr Gascoigne, also a member of
Birkbeck Students' Union Council,
has been described by Ms Bates as
'mad'.
The dispute follows an
•investigation into Birkbeck
Students' Union Bar. A financial
report on the bar was drawn up by
the University of London Union and
a team of accountants. Four formal
complaints were lodged against
John Kerranson, the Bar Manager,
as a result of the inquiry. It was also
alleged that £11,000 had 'gone
missing' from the bar's finances.
The Bar Inquiry was launched by
Ms Bates after disquiet about the
bar's finances. Ms Bates has
insinuated that the inquiry was
hindered by the Union Council,
which includes several members of
bar staff, including Mr Gascoigne.
Mr Gascoigne was last week
accused by Ms Bates of 'waging a
personal vendetta' against her. She
also alleged that M r Gascoigne, a
flatmate and colleague of M r
Kerranson, is in breach of the
Union's constitution by both
serving on the Union Council and
working as a Union employee.
Mr Gascoigne has accused Ms
Bates of awarding Union contracts
to 'close friends', and of making
irregular payments from the
Union's petty cash, though he says
that any suggestion of dishonesty is
'merely coincidental'. Ms Bates is
reported to have told Mr Gascoigne
that she was 'going to rip (his)
bollocks off and shove them up (his)
arse,' something she has since
denied. A vote on the motion was
pending as Felix went to press.
Loans update Security Changes
by Felix reporters
The take up rate for the government
student loan is up by 61% on last
year. The figures apply to the first
four weeks of the academic year,
and have been released by the
Student Loans Company. The
Company reports 82,000"
applications so far this year and
expects 350,000 loans to be taken
out by July. This is 10,000 more
loans than were taken out in total
in the first two years of the loan
scheme.
Latest figures show that of
56,800 student due to start
repayment of the loan in April,
32,000 are paying on time, 20,400
have had their payments deferred,
and 72 court summonses have been
issued to defaulters. Borrowers can
have their repayments deferred if
they are unemployed or if they are
earning less than 85% of national
average earnings.
Despite the increased take up o f
the loans, and the continued
freezing of the level of student
grants, college welfare sources
report that there have been few
students at Imperial complaining of
hardship so far this term. Stefano
Ruis, Imperial College Union's
Welfare Officer, commented that
there had been 'no significant
numbers' of students coming to H
i
m
with cases of financial problems.
This view has been supported by
Don Adlington, College's Student
Counsellor, who revealed that most
of the students coming to him were
overseas postgraduates, mainly with
problems concerning their funding.
Mr Adlington said that this may be
due to undergraduates in financial
difficulties going straight to other
people, such as their bank
managers, rather than seeking
counselling.
Imperial's circumstances seem to
be unique in the University of
London. Eleanor Merton, Vice
President of Communication and
Welfare at the University of London
Union (ULU), told Felix that the
level of student hardship in the
University of London has not
decreased this year, although more
students appear to be aware of
financial problems before they start
their courses. Ms Merton added that
many University of London
colleges, now having more financial
independence, are dealing internally
with hardship, rather than going
through University of London
channels.

A review of Union security is
underway following an assault on
a female student in the Union
Building last Saturday. Union
security staff face retraining, and a
male student will appear before the
Union disciplinary committee to
explain his alleged role in the
assault.
The attack took place in the Ents
lounge in the early hours of
Saturday morning, close to the end
of the 'Atmosphere' disco. The
victim told me that she was dancing
near the middle of the floor, when
she noticed a large group of
students, mostly male, surging
towards her. As she attempted to
get of their way, she says she was
pushed forward by the group
towards the stage. She crashed into
the side of the stage, and then fell
forwards onto it, injuring her knee
and leg. At this point, she claims
she was kicked about the upper
body by one of the students, causing
cuts and bruising. She said,' I was
lying flat on my face, and he kicked
me hard, with intent'.
At this stage, it is claimed that the
man walked away from the victim,
who then got up from the floor of
the stage, and confronted him. After
some jostling and an exchange of
opinions, she was pushed upwards
into the air and off the stage, before
crashing into the crowd. The victim
then says that she identified her
attacker to one of the Union
Stewards on duty. The victim
claims that she was not given
adequate first aid, or advised of any
procedure by which a disciplinary
action could be taken against her
alleged attacker.
In a statement to iCNN, Rick
Bilby, Deputy President of Imperial
College Union (ICU), wrote that the
job description of Union Steward is
currently under review, and that
Stewards currently have the same
responsibilities as last year's Duty
Officers. M r Bilby added that
Union Stewards will be trained in
first aid, basic law and security
procedures 'in the near future',
subject to confirmation from the
Metropolitan Police. Mr Bilby also
wrote that the student accused of
making the assault will be asked by
the Union disciplinary committee to
make a statement 'for its
consideration'. Mr Bilby would not
make any further verbal comment.
The Union Steward named by the
victim also declined to comment,
saying he did not want to prejudice
any forthcoming Union disciplinary
hearing.

Imperial College Catering
Committee is now enforcing
legislation on the sale and provision
of food at the College. The rules,
based on existing laws, have only
recently been enforced. According
to the legislation, public functions
held for more than fifty people must
have food supplied by qualified
catering staff. If less than fifty
people are in attendance then cold
food and drinks may be served.
The major groups affected in
Imperial are the overseas students
societies. Yen Yang Lim, Overseas
Students Committee (OSC)
chairman, explained that food forms
a major part of OSC society
functions, with societies fulfilling
their consitutions by promoting
their culture to non-nationals. He
expressed his concern that the new
regulations may restrict such
activities.
It is believed that senior College
figures have banned the use of
external catering firms for any
function within College buildings.
This means that, to comply with the
new laws, societies must use
College caterers for any food-based
events. It is feared that this may
dissuade societies from holding
their activities on College premises.
The Malaysian society held its
Deepavali Celebration at Malaysia
Hall near Marble Arch, after
Imperial College Union refused
permission for the event. Concern
has been expressed by many
societies at the extra cost to
Overseas groups of using College
and other catering firms.
The issue will be discussed by the
Imperial College Union Bar and
Catering Committee later today.
Some societies hope that some of
the College and environmental
health regulations can be relaxed
after this meeting. Chris Davidson,
Imperial College Union President,
has urged individual societies to
abide by the general ruling whilst
waiting for any changes. He added
that whatever the outcome of the
committee meeting, some events
would have to change or in some
cases would not be held at all.
When asked what would happen if
the rules were broken, M r .
Davidson said that a Union
disciplinary committee could
remove the right to hire rooms
within the Union if rules were
broken.
The first day of this week's
Overseas Students' Week saw many
societies selling food and drink at
their stalls. One society president,
who declined to be named, said that
though he had been warned not to
sell foodstuff, other socities
continued to do so and so his society
did the same. He added that no
Union Officers were present to stop
such activities.
