Ecstasy - The Fashion Drug
Tatiana Viera Lopes examines the ignorance and thepassion behind Britain's
latest drug craze, following a talk given by Dr John Henry from Guy's
Hospital.
A lot has been said about drug
abuse. Has it been enough, though?
Considering the amount of drugs
going around, I think not.
On Tuesday 3rd November, the
Science and Ethics Society invited
Dr John Henry from the Poisons
Department of Guy's Hospital to
talk about it. He has great
experience in dealing with cases of
drug abuse and is very aware of its
effects.
We could be

are going to

image of a
whole
generation.
The talk covered all sorts of drugs
from alcohol and tobacco to heroin
and ecstasy. Some of the scientific
facts were mentioned: how
addictive each drug is, how does it
become addictive, what are the
withdrawal symptoms etc., but the
really interesting parts were the
stories he told us about his personal
experiences when dealing with
these cases.
The talk was not conveyed
through a puritan point of view; he
didn't tell us what we already knew.
We all know that drugs are
dangerous, we all know that drugs
are bad. The real problem is what
we don't know about them, and it
is in this field that research, through
clinical history studies, is most
needed.
The members of our generation
who are drug consumers and who'll
survive this consumption will most
certainly suffer future medical
consequences, but it is not known
what these will be. We could be
dealing with substances that are
going to change the image of a
whole generation, just like acid
(LSD) did in the 60s.
Today, it isn't L S D which is in.
It's ecstasy. Ecstasy is becoming
part of a teenagers' culture.
Obviously it is not everywhere!

you up and put you in a good mood
(we all wish those existed, but they
don't) but in any club you'll always
find someone who has it for sale and
many on it already.
It's the fashion drug. Ecstasy by
itself is already an exciting word.
Songs speak about it, you use it to
express energetic excitement on the
dance floor and it is not addictive,
to some people it is cool to take E
as it makes you get in the mood to
rave.
Any hard-core raver will know
what I'm talking about. It releases
your libido and makes you feel
brave.
The problem with ecstasy is that
nothing is known about it. Ask
anyone and they'll tell you horrible
stories of what has happened to
people on E (like you used to hear
about LSD), but there are very few
medical records which could
provide a scientific base for
conclusions. Its long term effects
are not known as the drug is too
new. But in a few years we might
get a large number of people
suffering from ecstasy psychosis.

not advising you to try it. All I'm
doing is stating the facts. If you're
brave enough or curious enough
then you might be tempted to see
for yourself (then you can always
blame it on scientific curiosity) but
remember that one shouldn't need-
artificial additives to have fun.
Personally, I think we already get
enough Es in our food, why bother
to pay £ 1 0 to £15 for a little pill
which doesn't even taste good.
If you're still curious or have any
questions, get in touch with Alcan
Fernandes, Materials PG1. He'll
invite back Dr Henry, who'll be
most glad to speak to us once more.
