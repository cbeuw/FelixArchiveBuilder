Cannibalism: The Last Taboo
by Brian Marriner
This book is not for the feeble
minded or those with a weak
stomach. It describes all the known
incidents of cannibalism, from those
that ate through tradition, those that
ate through necessity, those that ate
for profit and those that ate for the
sheer perverse enjoyment.
The book is very easy to swallow
and can give anyone ideas. After
all, it does state that all the people
who have eaten human flesh found
the taste was of a quality close to
any other meat that they had eaten.
It also linked modern cannibalism
with sexual perversion; we all
remember the case of Jeffery
Dahmer - the homosexual man eater
from Wisconsin only in 1990.
So cannibalism is dead ? Read this
book; it's not dead and neither were
half the people that were eaten. It
even made me start to wonder what
half my friends taste of - oh, and
that's an open invitation to dinner...

The Colour of Magic
(Graphic Novel) - Terry
Pratchett
Ankh-Morpork is probably the most
dangerous, crime-infested, bad-
natured, dirty, poor city on the
Discworld that you could ever hope
to avoid. Quite why Two flower
comes from the other side of the
Disc to visit, no one knows. In fact
he is the only tourist Ankh-Morpork
has ever had. The fact that he has
a trunk full of gold (which follows
him around where ever he goes on
hundreds of little legs, and has the
temperament of a rabid rottweiler),
makes him fairly popular and leads
to all kind of trouble.
How Rincewind, a fairly useless
wizard (seeing how he only knows
one spell and he learnt that by
accident) but a brilliant coward,
ends up guiding Twoflower through
the city, trying to save his life on
numerous occasions, you must read
the book to discover.
The story itself is superb, as is the
artwork and humour of Terry
Pratchett. The only problem was
that having read the paperback, I
thought Rincewind would have
looked a lot scruffier, with a more
hopeless sense of fashion, than he
did in this comic version. However,
the comic version also meant that
all the little subplots (or waffle, as
other people see it) was missed out,
so you could follow the story quite
well.
If you like graphic novels and Terry
Pratchett's sense of wit then this is
a must for your collection.

The Myth-ing Ombibus by
Robert Asprin
Both Myth-ing Omnibus books are
described as 'seriously funny' with
a varied cast and I cannot have put
it better myself.
Each book, a combination of
three separate books, follows on
perfectly from the previous and they
all describe a different adventure of
Skeeve, a teenage apprentice
magician masquerading as a real
magician. Skeeve frequently winds
up in life-threatening situations and
with the help of Aahz; a demon,
Gleep; his loyal dragon and the
sexually-teasing Tananda, he not
only escapes from each disaster but
he always makes a tidy profit. The
books also follow the growing
relationship of Aahz and Skeeve as
he encounters a few of life's
problems, like dealing with
vampires and how to run from a
lynch mob.
The humour is deeply sarcastic
and sometimes very silly with our
'hero' nearly always at the centre
of it. The funniest situation is when
Skeeve has to convince an angry
mob that he really is dying on the
gallows and he describes quite
modestly his acting performance.
The only part of the books I hated
was the damn American spelling of
words like colour. Call me picky,
but I think that any book designed
for an English reader should be
translated from American into
English.
£8.99 for each book might sound
pricey but it is definitely worth it
for six of the most whimsical books
available.

500 Tips for Students by
Phil Race
Student days may be the best of
your lives but that doesn't mean that
they are the easiest. All to often
people come to college with dreams
and ambitions, and after only a
couple of months they fade and die
as their chosen subject dominates
and rejects them, so how do you
conquer your course and still be an
interesting person with time to do
some fun things .
Well you could do a lot worse
than follow the advice of " 500 Tips
For Students". A light tome with
invaluable advice on how to
maintain your energy and
enthusiasm whilst studying. Laid
out in 51 sections, covering topics
from "Time Management " to
"Improving Your Memory " the
book, at first sight, appears to be
a massive collection of common
sense that everyone is obviously
aware of.
So why buy it ? Common sense
is something that almost everybody
lacks. This is especially true of
people in the top 2% bracket of
intelligence; yes, those of us at
college. Even if you prize yourself
on being pretty good at working
things out and at using your time
quite well, this book will back you
up. It will get you off to a good
start. It will keep you going until the
very end by getting you to recognise
your goals in life.
Along the lines of several other
motivational-common sense
products such as "How To Win
Friends and Influence People " and
"The Magic of Thinking Big " ,
"500 Tips Foe Students " opens
your eyes to your true potential. In
simple terms it presents obvious
facts about learning and getting on
with things. Despite its easy to read
style, it still manages to excite and
should be kept near at all times
while at college. That extra boost
from a few lines of text could mean
the difference between a pass and
a fail, or a 1st or 2nd class degree.
Read this book and knock them
dead.
