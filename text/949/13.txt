Singapura Exotica
Singapore (our country has just
banned chewing gum. Does it ring
any bells?).
There is about 100 of us here,
feeling ever so relaxed and laidback
about the light workload of the
course at Imperial College. So one
day, one of us had an idea: why not
put on a broadway show for all the
world to see?
So we had this vision, a vision
soon to be realised. 'Singapura
Erotica' will be the first ever
performance in the history of the
Singapore Society.
The Exotica aims to give the
audience a brief outline of the
history of Singapore. From a small
fishing village, Singapore has been
a British colony, and a fallen land(?)
during the Second World War,
before becoming the modern and
vibrant city of today. Since
independence in 1965, Singapore
has come a long way in just 27
years from a small island with just
2 million people and no natural
resources.
Certainly, Singapore does not
possess a history as ancient as China
or a tradition as old as Britain.
However, it is a society made up of
immigrants who came from all over
the world many years ago. The
various ethnic groups brought with
them their culture and way of life.
Over the decades saw the blending
to give a unique character. The
nation today boasts of a people of
all races and religions living in
harmony.
With this central theme, the
Exotica presents the story of
Singapore via multi-media. The
audience will be treated to a
humorous cross-talk, a fine-tuned
precision drill, plus sketches,
dances and songs. A fine selection
of slides on scenes of old and
modern Singapore, together with
snippets of video clips, will also be
shown.
On top of that, there is also going
to be a guest performance by the
International Shaolin Kungfu
Frederation and the Tiger Clan
Combination Organisation. They
will be giving a dynamic lion dance
and a stunning display of Chinese
martial arts.
It must be stressed that a
tremendous amount of time and
effort has gone into putting on this
production. Preparation started as
early as May this year and during
these few months, nothing has been
spared in order to present the
audience with the best
entertainment, complete with visual
and audio effects, authentically
tailored costumes air-flown from
Singapore, and fabulous sets and
props.
So, why don't you come?

FilmSoc - Point Break
Ladies Rugby
This week, FilmSoc is delighted to
be showing perhaps one of the most
action-packed films of the year,
Point Break.
Keanau Reeves plays a hot shot
FBI agent assigned to the 'Old
Presidents' bank robbers case.
Wearing rubber masks of Nixon,
Carter etc (hence their name) this
slick and organised group of thieves
have successfully robbed several
banks and have so fare completely
outwitted the police. However a
vital clue discovered by Reeves'
partner leads the FBI to suspect a
group of surfers. Enter Patrick
Swayze and friends, a wild group
looking for the ultimate adrenalin
rush. Reeves befriends the group,
learning to surf in the process, and
takes part in ever more dangerous
'stunts' including some breath-
taking sky diving scenes.
This film has a lot more to it than
just exciting visual scenes, as the
dangerous cat and mouse games
between Reeves and Swayze belies
their true identities. So for a great
evening's entertainment, and a film
with more stunts in it than a film
with a lot of stunts, come along to
Mech Eng 220 at 7.30pm on
Thursday 26th November. Entry
for non members is £1.90, and only
90p for members. If you haven't
joined yet, £6.50 allows you to
enter the film for free. We look
forward to seeing you.
Yes, it's happened, and it hasn't
happened in a small way. The
Ladies Rugby Team is back with
vengance and growing bigger by the
day. The men thought they had the
monopoly on this fabulous sport—
the drinking, the rolling around in
the mud, the grabbing of each
other's private parts and most
importantly the team baths. Well
perhaps we won't to participate in
all these passtimes but we will
certainly give the beer drinking a
go. If you are interested in playing
for us or even just coming out for
some fun: the practices are
Thursday lunchtimes
12.30-1.45pm, meet at 12.30 in the
Union foyer or join us in Hyde Park
(next to the tennis courts at 1pm),
or Sunday mornings 1 lam—meet in
Beit Quad. We generally go for a
drink in Southside after Sunday
training so if you don't manage to
make it to the practice join us there
for a chat. We're hot big, we are
not all rough we are just normal
people like you and none of us have
ever played before either! Hope to
see you soon. If you have any
questions contact Gina Mortley
M R E 2 or Samantha Cox c/o Felix.
Wine tasting, The Sequel
Wine tasting revisited—for those of
you who have yet to try the delights
of this society we present a brief
resume of the past few week's
tastings to whet your appetite for the
events still to happen this term and
next.
But first this...IMPORTANT
A N N O U N C E M E N T : Wine Rack
of Knightsbridge are generously
offering a 10% discount on all
purchases, on production of your
Wine Tasting Society membership
card. And, of course with your
membership card, you're still
entitled to a £1 discount on all
Tuesday tastings (membership is £7
for the year and an average tasting
costs £ 4 for non-members).
So, what have you missed already
this term?
27th October. Italy—'The longest
vineyard in the world'. Best
White—Soave DOC, Anselmi 1990
£5.49. Best Red—Chianti Classico
Riserva 'Poggio a'Frati' D O C G ,
Rocca di Castagnoli 1987 £6.99. A
taste of history—2000 year old
wine! Well, actually no, but Falerno
is made from the same grape variety
the Ancient Romans used (or as
near as can be cultivated). A spicy
red, at £8.99 it's little more than a
curiosity, the general consensus was
that the Roman Empire was
welcome to it!
3rd November. New World vs
Old—or Northern Hemisphere vs
Southern or France vs Australia.
Best White—Montana Sauvignon,
New Zealand, Montana 1991
£5.29. Best Red—Rowan Cabertnet
Sauvignon, Aus., Rowan 1986
£6.99. The battle ended as a draw
with the characteristic Australian as
a full fruited, up-front wine, whilst
the French relied on a complexity
and subtlety of flavours. Both types
were recognised for being very
different wines but it must be said
that the Australians tended to come
out on top!
Coming up—24th November—
Beaujolais, 1st December—Blind
Tasting (with prizes for the best
taster/guesser), 8th
December—Port.
Remember, meetings are
Tuesday 6pm in the Union Lounge,
all are welcome and with
membership cards you can not only
get discount tastings but also get
10% from Wine Rack in
Knightsbridge. See you there.
