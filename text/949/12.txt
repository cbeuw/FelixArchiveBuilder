All Work And No Play Makes Jack A
Don Adlington, the Student Counsellor, gives us a survival guide to studying
at Imperial College, outlining the problems that can occur and suggesting
methods of dealing with them.
Problems Do Occur
Given the entry qualification
demanded of students coming to
Imperial College, it is unlikely that
anyone admitted will be incapable
of working at degree level, and
ultimately of attaining a degree.
Undergraduates already have
experience in studying and in
examination preparation by the time
they arrive here. Despite this, it is
not at all uncommon for students to
discover that this does not guarantee
a smooth transition to successful
study at university. The study skills
and learning habits which brought
success at G C S E and 'A' levels may
prove to be inadequate at university,
and academic work becomes a
problem. This is as likely to happen
to the person with outstandingly
good ' A ' level grades as to anyone
else, but it is always a demoralising
experience and it needs to be
identified and dealt with.
Reasons For Academic Problems
The Unrelenting Work-Load
When first year undergraduates
have academic difficulties, it
usually has more to do with the
volume and unrelenting nature of
the work-load, rather, than its
intellectual level. Students who used
to work in short intensive bursts
before examinations and have not
been used to week-in-week-out
effort, may well find themselves in
difficulty.
Half-Heart id Learning
Learning is an interactive process
demanding time, energy and
commitment. Effective learning
cannot be done by half-heartedly
reading through lecture notes or
handouts. Responding to problem
sheets, or group interaction in class
will be more fruitful.
Thinking Is Intrinsically Difficult
It can also be a vaguely unwelcome
activity, at least initially. Because
of this we have a tendency to skirt
round it. For many, the problem is
getting started. We think of other
important, less demanding things to
do instead, like writing letters,
washing up or shopping.
Lack Of Self-Motivation
Students sometimes run into
difficulties because, for the first
time, their work is determined by
minute-to-minute decisions as to
how they use their time. The moral
constraints of family or teachers are
no longer there. The emphasis is on
self-motivation.
Balancing Work And Play
It can take a little time to find the
balance between the demands of
work and those of other interests.
Time management is a skill that
must be acquired if it isn't there
already. Studying at university is a
full time job, and is probably the
hardest job most of us will ever do.
It inevitably involves trading in or
postponing other desirable ends.
Lack Of Rewards
All psychological literature on
learning emphasises the importance
of reward, and the notion that
reward is central to effective
learning is related to successful
study at university. The rewards of
prestige, economic security and of
fulfilling the expectations of one's
family are the obvious ones. If these

things are not valued sufficiently,
the resilience and buoyancy
necessary to overcome difficulties
will be undermined, and the student
will falter.
Rewarding learning is also true in
the day to day sense. When a
student is having difficulty with
work, he or she is denied the vital
reward of understanding, which
may depress confidence and affect
other areas of study. It is this close
identification of the emotional state
of confidence with successful
ongoing study, and the converse
identification of intellectual defeat
with depressiveness and academic
problems, which lends such
urgency to dealing with the
problem.

What If You Are Worried About Your Work?
Stand On Your Head!
Be pragmatic. If your work habits
do not seem effective, change them.
If you get distracted working in
your room, try the library. If you
find it difficult working in the
evenings, try getting up earlier and
do some then. Don't spend hour
after hour staring blankly at notes,
text book or problem sheets. Break
away for a short time - have a cup
of coffee, walk around for a bit,
stand on your head in the corner if
it helps - then try again.
Break It Up
Break down your work into small
tasks. Put a limit on what you're
going to do, and for how long. A
disorganised approach to work may
have suited you before, but if the
evidence is that it is not adequate
now, change the way you do things,
and feel confident that you are
capable of changing.
Go And See A Tutor
Talk to your personal tutor. If you
prefer not to do this, make an
appointment to see your senior
tutor, who you can see without
disloyalty or discourtesy to your
personal tutor. On the whole,
academic staff are tolerant of a less
than perfect performance,
recognising that people have
different levels of competence and
different rates of getting themselves
into their degree course. It is
possible for you to become worried
about your work before it becomes
obvious to anyone else. The onus
is on you to initiate discussion about
it with those best fitted to help you.
Read Guides To Studying
By all means look in libraries and
book shops for books on study skills
and study problems - you may well
find something helpful. There is
also a very short booklet available

in College called Study Success. It
was written by two current
members of the academic staff
heavily involved in undergraduate
teaching, and is both thoughtful and
relevant. Ask your senior tutor or
departmental office for a copy, or
ring me and I will send you one.
See Me
I am always available and my work
is entirely confidential. I won't for
example, talk to your department
behind your back. Your time at
university is precious. It is also
finite and there may be practical
reasons for talking around work
anxieties sooner rather than later.
For one thing, the relentless flood
of material coming at you can cause
a feeling of panic. For another
thing, timing may be critically
important if there is the possibility
of transferring to another course,
department or university.
A Final Word
None of the college staff derives
satisfaction from students' academic
distress. There is a great concern
that students who are not working
well should be identified early
enough for real help to be given,
and the key to that, quite often, is
the student's willingness to
acknowledge the problem.
Think about it.
