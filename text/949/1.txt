Culture shock rumpus in JCR
by D Spooner and L Yates
The Junior Common Room (JCR)
was closed early on Wednesday
afternoon after a disturbance
involving the Turkish, Cypriot and
Hellenic (Greek) Societies.
The commotion was apparently
caused by a tourist poster displayed
on the Turkish Society stall for
Overseas Week 1992, and a map
and tourist material on the same
stall, which showed Northern
Cyprus as the Turkish Republic Of
Northern Cyprus. Northern Cyprus
has been a disputed territory since
it was invaded by Turkey in 1974,
but is not recognised by British
Government, or the United Nations.
When a Cypriot Society member
saw the poster he complained to
Turkish Society members manning
the stand, and asked them to remove
the poster. The Turkish Society
members refused to do so. The
Cypriot Society member then left,
and returned with other members of
the Cypriot and Hellenic Societies,
including executive members of
both Societies. The group asked
again for the removal of the displays
which they regarded as offensive.
The Turkish Society again declined.
The crowd then acted in a manner
described in an I C U written
statement as 'aggressive'.
Independent witnesses reported
seeing various objects being thrown
at the Turkish stand. Rick Bilby,
I C U Deputy President, and
Dominic Wilkinson, ICU Honorary
Secretary (Events), were called to
the JCR, along with executive
members of the Overseas Students'
Committee (OSC) and members of
College security.
The Greeks and Cypriots were
then asked to leave the JCR. They
refused, and began singing their
national anthems. At this point the
JCR was cleared, and all stands
were shut down. The poster was
later judged to contravene ICU
publicity rules (section 7, paragraph
4) which state that no material may
be displayed which could cause
offence.
The Turkish Society alleges that
the previous day (Tuesday) the
Hellenic and Cypriot Societies had
both displayed material which could
be considered offensive to the
Turkish community, though it has
been claimed that this material was
removed at the request of Turkish
students. The Turkish Society
further claimed that they are
continually oppressed by the Greeks
and Cypriots, and that the material
on their stand was only being used
to promote Turkish beliefs and
culture, the objectives of the
Overseas Week. They added that
their material had no political
content.
The Cypriot and Hellenic
Societies, in an interview with
(CNN, stated that 'Cyprus is an
independent state; it has nothing to
do with Turkey, or Greece'.
Members of these Societies then
alleged that Rick Bilby had
threatened their Societies with
closure if they did not leave the
JCR. Mr. Bilby is a member of the
ICU Disciplinary Committee,
which has the power to refuse
funding for any society after a
consensus decision. When asked if
he was attempting to pre-empt the
decision of the committee, Mr Bilby
would neither confirm nor deny the
accusation and insisted on replying
via a printed statement which failed
to answer our question.
Yen Yang Lim, chairman of the
Overseas Students' Committee,
later declined to comment on the
incident, and added that (CNN and
Felix should not publish details of
the incident. When pressed further,
he condemned the 'anti- social'
behaviour of an unnamed group,
and apologised to those whose
efforts had been disrupted.

Charter in pipeline
by D Curry, News Editor
Conservative Central Office sources
have confirmed reports that the
Government will publish a
'students' charter' before
Christmas. Sources have told (CNN
that a document, expected to be
titled 'The Further and Higher
Education Charter', will be printed
before 5th December, the date of
the next Whitehall-wide Charter
meeting. The Department for
Education ( D F E ) , while not
denying the reports, say that an
education charter will be published
by the New Year.
It is not expected that voluntary
membership will be introduced, in
the charter. Senior officers of the
National Union of Students (NUS)
have consistently claimed that the
cabinet is split on the issue, with the
Education Secretary, John Patten,
becoming increasingly isolated. It
is thought that Mr Patten would
prefer to implement voluntary
membership from his department,
rather than leave the matter with Mr
Waldegrave, Charter Minister. Mr
Patten has already promised to
make a separate statement on
voluntary membership around
Christmas, and has also spoken of
publishing a legislative paper in
January 1994, apparently blocking
a substantial announcement on
voluntary membership in the
charter.
Chris Davidson, President of
Imperial College Union (ICU), has
announced the full membership of
the ICU working party on voluntary
membership. In addition to Mr
Davidson, the committee will
consist of Nicky Fox, Rachel
Mountford, Jonty Beavan, Demi
Jones, Rhian Pickton, Hugh Eland,
Oliver Shergold, Boon Yeo; Steve
Farrant, Sarah Lee, and two
representatives from the C & G C U .
The first meeting has been
scheduled for 12 noon next
Thursday (26th November), and
will outline problems, share
information and consider plans
already drawn up by Union staff.
