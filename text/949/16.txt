Freaky Realistic—Milk Bar
I can't see a God damn thing. No,
kill that. I can see a strobe light, and
three heads. One of a capacity 600
crowd, I get the feeling I'm not the
only one who is becoming slighty
impartial to this lot. At least they
give me a chance to write my
shopping list. They seem to want to
belong to a scene with Natural Life,
or East 17, that kind of ballpark. As
the set progresses, at least I can see
the band. Maybe some people are
leaving. Maybe there are six of
them on stage.

Strollercoaster—The
Camden Underworld
7.11.92
What is it with Australia? Is
originality a dirty word? Why do
they feel they have to copy
somebody else to be noticed? Using
the inside of your trousers to keep
you mic is just disgusting.
The first of the real acts, in this
bohemian decadence that is the
Strollercoaster tour, are The
Cuckoos. John Fat Beast introduces
them, saying they're his favourite.
I'm not arguing with his decision
but personally the half an hour they
played for has left absolutely no
lasting impression.
The Hinnes, tonight's next
offering could never be accused of
leaving no impression. But being
very loud and brash is not art. And
it's definitely not enjoyable.
The next act, if such a word is
Zodiac Mindwarp—My Life
Story
A first glance of the listed tracks,
the innocuously titled T Love You'
sounds almost sadistic amongst
'Raw and Bleeding', 'Slutfreak' and
such like, but is one of the slower
'heart-warming' tracks.
The rest of it is basically
subversive gothic thrash with tits of
blues-rock, which sounds like the
Psychedelic Furs, White Zombie
and the Rolling Stones cross-bred.
The back cover sports a checklist
of an obscene array of drugs
(complete with ticks), such as
ketamine, mandrax, PCP etc (more
common stuff also there)
reinforcing the mindwarp bit.
'Holy Gasoline': unrepentant
blasphemers or just a great song
(the latter suits me find). The title
track 'My Life Story' contains a lot
of neglected anguish...(sorry,
almost another opportunity to
bombard you with pretentious
bullshit). But I have to say there are
subtle undercurrents of malignance
and possibly cold turkey throughout
this mini-LP.
Not bad considering it was
knocked up in ten days or so—
whenever you're feeling down, but
angry, this is the biz. Pure
unrestrained sleaze—brilliant.

appropriate, is Genius Freak. A
lone figure fills the stage. He rocks,
he pouts, he generally makes a
complete fool of himself.
I detest bands that have names I
can't pronounce. And what happens
if I happen to like them? 'They were
great, but I can't for the life of me
tell you who they were.' A bit silly
really. A bit of a shame. What an
absolutely, enchanting voice. On
the showing tonight, which is
nothing special particularly for a
last night, they stand heads and
shoulders above the rest.
There were strong rumours that
Levitation were going to be 'extra
special guests'. If they were I
missed them. My dinner decided to
do a boomerang so after ten minutes
of mighty stomach exercise I left.
I sort of hope they didn't turn up,
it would make me feel a little better.

Anna Palm —Love Me
Love me indeed. The voice and
violin of Anna Palm drift
effortlessly, almost helplessly from
another plane with the immediate
simplistic splendour of 'Don't
Know', the highlight in my book.
For solitary listening, through
dinner parties, to wherever else you
so desire, the beauty of this album
is a perfect accompaniment and it
only left my record deck when I was
forced at gunpoint to listen to
something else.

If you want to hear some Anna
Palm, tune into the Chidren in Need
benefit on G L R tonight, 7.30pm

Prince and the New Power
Generation — Love Symbol
Prince can hardly be accused of
resting on his Paisley patterned
laurels as barely a year since
'Diamonds and Pearls' he delivers
another 16 tracks running to 75
minutes, issued under an enigmatic
gold symbol. The single gave us
advance warning of what to expect;
'My name is Prince—and I am
funky...' and so the album appears
to pick up where the last one left
off. In fact the funk becomes quite
relentless, reminiscent of the
unreleased but widely circulated
Black Album. It moves into James
Brown territory with 'Sexy M . F . '
(yes, this does go some way to
explain the 'beware, indelicate
language' sticker on the C D case),
and makes several attempts at rap,
which is one area at least that
'Pearls' and 'Blue Light' offer some
melodic relief, the latter being a not
totally convincing reggae exercise.
Albums
Moonshake, Eva Luna
Avant-garde experimentalists, they
have taken My Bloody Valentine's
sound to a point where even Kevin
Shields couldn't of imagined it was
possible to take it. So much so that
this record does little to resemble
their M B V inspired first and only
Creation EP.
Rasping dub-basslines, crashing
guitars, balearic break-beats,
ridiculous samples fuse together to
form a sound of rare originality, but
a sound of often quite menacing
proportions. It is the perfect back-
drop for the acid-bathed
observations of Margaret Fiedler
and David Callagan who share the
song-writing in Moonshake. It's not
what one would call a cosy
relationship, more , an
uncomfortable fusion of two
seriously distorted minds. The most
frightening aspect is that their
observations are uncannily acute
and accurate. This record is a
social-commentary of inner city
gloom fuelled by vitriol and
cynicism towards a socially inept
political system; a society based on
apathy heading on a path of self-
destruction. From the
glamourisation of serial-killers,
unwanted pregnancy, the homeless.
Moonshake are not afraid to deal
with issues that the populace find
uncomfortable. These aren't the
fashionable fears that Callagan sings
about in 'City Poison'. Moonshake
care about the issues they sing
about.

Out now on Too Pure.
Most of the tracks cover the familiar
territory of sex and yet more sex,
but with less of the devotional
material this time. 'The
Continental' gives a graphic
description of what a woman
expects from Prince by way of a
physical performance
And at this point the character of
the album changes. Prince regains
his pop sensibilities and we are
treated to a rare mixture of styles,
including '3 Chains o'Gold', a rock
opera/pomp rock confection that
would have left Queen open
mouthed. So what is the sum of the
various parts? It's hard to say when
dealing with such quantity, but
program your C D player and you
could have two distinct albums here
and both pretty fine representatives
of their respective genres.
