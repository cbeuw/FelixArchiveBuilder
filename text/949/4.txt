O p t o u t b e n e f i t s ?
Dear Felix,
It seems to me that whether or not
IC leaves London University, we
should make it clear that the name
of this institution should not change.
There is no advantage to being
called a 'university' mainly due to
the fact that most people who read
about a new 'Imperial University'
will automatically think that we are
some sort of jumped up
polytechnic. No one is fooled by
establishments such as the 'New
University of M i d Wales
incorporating the allied union of
sheep botherers' or whatever.
Everybody can see that the
polytechnics are just trying to give
themselves some much needed
credibility by stealing the
'prestigious' uni name. I also
suggest that those people who think
that everyone will recognise that an
Imperial University is just the same
as Imperial College are mistaken.
Our reputation will diminish and
our foreign standing will suffer
likewise because no one outside this
country will know what is going on.
In short, there are only two
acceptable alternative names for this
great place. We can stay as Imperial •
College, or we can shorten the
name (as many people already do
in conversation) to plain old
Imperial which maintains our
credibility but distinguishes us from
our old London University days.
Yours faithfully,
My les W A Davison.
P.S. If we do leave, please let us
keep our A.R.C.S.'s and so on.

Dear Jonty,
Whatever the next narrow-
minded attacks or insults following
my articles in favour of responsibly
investigating the mysteries of LSD,
I am no longer going to bother
answering them for fear of
becoming boring and predictably
stuck up on the subject as my
opponents. (Maybe it's too late
already?).
They can walk the streets in
public alcoholic stupors or
intoxicate others through passive
smoking under the benediction of
the law and middle-aged
anti-modern-youth-institution-ad-
dicted-know-it-alls.
Like many 'internal freedom'
seeking university students (
—
maybe some of their friends they
wouldn't speak to if they realised?),
I'm off to explore human
P h o n e p a i n
Dear Jonty,
I am writing to complain about
the college telephone exchange.
Anyone living in a College
residence will know that it is almost
impossible for anyone to call them
from outside College on weekday
evenings. Weekends are worse;
calls rarely get through even in the
middle of the day.
On two occasions last week
someone tried to call me on an
important matter, but no one
answered at the switchboard. This
was at 8.30pm.
On another occasion, a friend was
told by the operator not to bother
trying to call College after 8.00pm
during the week. This is despite the
fact that we are led to believe that
the exchange is supervised around
the clock.
This situation is simply
consciousness as they will never
know it.
Whoever I am should be
irrelevant.

unacceptable.
Since the opinion of an
undergraduate may not be regarded
as significant in this context,
consider this: We are supposed to
be one of thw world's foremost
educational establishments, but at
the same time, we are unable to
insure that 'employees and
academics of the College are able
to receive external calls via the
exchange after 8 o'clock or at
weekends.
This situation is simply
unacceptable.
I hope that something can be done
about this, and that College clearly
states during which times the
exchange is expected to be A N D
A C T U A L L Y IS open.
Yours,
Kaveh Guilanpour, Biochem 3.

Dear Editor,
When I first came to Imperial
College, I swore that I would go
into life with an open mind. I
believe that part of this would be to
never think of any of my fellow
students as sad. I am referring to the
Editorial in Felix 947 where you
utter your editorial contempt to the
activities of the mascoteer. The
demise of which I feel is a sad loss
to the college just as the precious
9.30am starts which were wiped out
with the tyranny that Margaret
Thatcher demolished the N C B .
Although I admit to feel it is taken
far too seriously by some poeple I
think it a pathetic attack of a college
tradition which still has much to
offer the student today. Not only
does the mascot help give the
student an identity but also
something worth looking after. As
to the money aspect I remind the
editor that ramming shaving foam
in people's faces is one method
sponsored by the Union and another
being the 'kidnapping' of people. I
refer to the case in the late eighties
when the IC Union president was
kidnapped during rag and a £ 1 0 0
ransom fee was delivered. The
reply was that the college would pay
£100 for the kidnappers to keep
him. Maybe this could happen this
year to some hacks, sad or not.
I understand the concern that can
arise from accidents and the way
activities can become addictive and
soul consuming. I do feel however
that there are many other activities
throughout the college that are not
only potentially harmful but have a
consuming effect on a person's
attitude to life. I can refer to
rowing, rugby, biking,
conservatism, Rag and many, many
more. I would hope that as editor
you spend a large proportion of
your time thinking and talking
Felix, but does this mean you
deserve our contempt? I would hope
not.
Yours,
Thomas Sullivan, RSM.
P.S. I must say that this letter is
in reply to your editorial and I must
add a big thank you for all your
hard work to produce a student
newspaper we can all be proud of.
