Thora Hirers Ents Guide
Gird your loins and lock up your
daughters. For one night only,
Atmosphere becomes Kamporama.
Tonight the run of the mill Friday
night at the Union has become
invaded by Camp spangle-wielding
starship troopers who will make you
funk. So, don your flares,
platforms, groovy tops and kinky
afros and experience the
phenomena that is Spank.
Spank have been spanking the
buttocks of many a London Club,
gathering outstanding fine:
responses from their throbbing
audiences wherever they have
played. Their mix of funk and disco
is sure to set your hipsters alight and
will have your flabby buttocks
moving from 0-60 in 3 seconds.
Along with these diplomats of
funk will be an equally groovy hi-
fidelic disco playing a mix of latest
and greatest in funk/camp music, as
well as some shoe tapping disco and
80s electro pop. To heighten your
enjoyment of this extravaganza and
ease the strain on your pockets, turn
up in retro clothing and get a
massive discount before 11pm.
Normal price is £2.50 in advance,
£3 on the door or a measly £ 1 . 5 0
Sis
for Ents card holders. The whole
shebang blasts off at 8pm and there
is also a Smile Zone happy hour
from 8.30pm to 10pm with all
drinks reduced by 20% (I hope!).
As Thora Hird would say 'kick
off those sling backs and funk'. As
usual entry fee applies to the whole
union building and the usual no
readmission applies.
P.S. Anyone who still wishes to
join Ents, come to the meeting at
1.00pm on Tuesday in the Ents/Rag
Office (2nd floor Union Building
east staircase). If you can't make it
then, come and search us out at
lunchtimes in the Union.

Technophobia
Computers know. It's true they do.
They have senses. Once the pen and
paper are discarded as mere relics
of a bygone age the bastards break
down. The last time it happened I
swear I heard it laugh. I had taken
to giving the computer in the Union
Office a pet name, much in the
same spirit as you do when buying
a banger of a secondhand car,
hoping that being nice will prevent
them from breathing their last at
inconvenient moments. Fat chance.
Technology is therefore a
complete waste of time, or chips.
Progress does not exist. Computers
are simply an extension to the house
of clutter that offices are and always
will be, filled with bluffers with
keyboards pretending that those
files of paper, of which the stuff
stored on computer is just a
duplicate of, do not exist. Own up
the great British public, we don't
trust them.
Or maybe it's just me being crap.
I remember the ZX80. Enough to
put you off for life.
If there was a point to any of the
above then it was a way of
introducing the new member of the
family of computers that are
multiplying at an alarming rate
within the Union Office. This one
is for room bookings, I think. No
more books daubed with Tippex
and crossings out, in theory at least.
No more to-ing and fro-ing for
clubs and societies between the
Union Office and the Conference
Office in Sherfield, in theory at
least.
However be patient. Michelle and
I will be doing our best but I hate
computers. They know. It's true
they do.
A change of tack in the dinghy of
thought and on to events. Tonight
Atmosphere is pushed aside and
taken over by its alter ego,
Kamporama. A heady mix of
excess, hedonism, 70s and 80s tack
and disco camp. Spank on stage will
be turning the love groove. £3 in,
£2.50 in advance. Lick it, taste it,
Ooh baby baby.
Christmas is coming which
means a tinsel studded production
from Dramsoc. This year it's
Twelfth Night. Cod pieces on.
Look at the What's On column
for a totally unfactual account of
events in and around College.
Kick off those Sling-backs and
enjoy.
Dominic Wilkinson, Hon Sec
(Events).
