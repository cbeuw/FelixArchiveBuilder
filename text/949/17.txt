Miss World-The First
Female Serial Killer
The title track opens with Nick
Cave type vocals, bleak, dark and
cold; the fact that it's both
enlightening, depressing and
disturbingly unnerving makes it
incredibly mysterious, but so cool.
T am you' has an excellent faint
echo/backing vocal on it giving a
very spooky fuzzbox type effect,
reminiscent of King Crimson's
'Twentieth Century Schizoid Man',
but to a lesser and most appropriate
extent.
Unfortunately 'Dead Flowers'
ends up as a lemon filler track, with
nasty traces of corp-rock, absolute
The Boo Badleys—Lazarus
Just when it seemed that the Boo
Radleys were destined to fill the
space on the Creation roster vacated
by MBV's recent departure to
Island Records, the 'Lazarus' EP
comes along owing as much to their
halcyon days as Dinosaur Jnr
imitators as to the direction taken
on their debut Creation long player,
'Everything's Alright Forever'.
The pure-pop of the 7" edit of
'Lazarus' is only half the story. The
extended version combines dub-
basslines, Spanish style flamenco
guitars, trumpets and an organ to
Concert
Joanna McGregor
The pianist Joanna McGregor came
to the Barbican with a solo program
of mainstream and fringe classical,
and some 'jazz' arrangements. And
underneath all the media hype she
is in fact an excellent pianist with
a pleasingly diverse repertoire.
The concert began with three
'Gnossiennes' and 'Sports et
Divertissements' by Eric Satie, the
first lyrical, spare and quite
beautiful, the second decidedly
more experimental. Two jazz
arrangements of popular songs by
Django Bates (of the group 'Loose
Tubes') may work well for an
ensemble, but did not on solo piano.
The music took a more maniacal
turn after the break, and thus
became more interesting, with
'Winnsboro' Cotton Mill Blues' by
the (still-living) American Frederic
Rzewski, a piece inhabiting the
trite.
However the last track 'Thief
inside' is an absolute classic, gentle
intro with seemingly looney vocals,
the tinkering ivories chill your spine
and the ending lyric of 'tap your
heels together three times' leaves
you completely gobsmacked. So
incredibly dire, it's brilliant. But
watch out it'll subtley erode your
sanity and believe me, I'm insane.
Great cover sleeve of a
precocious-looking little girl in tutu
etc as if she's ready to do 'Swan
Lake', but on a dark background
reflecting the general mood of the
record.
Not the best thing I've heard but
its unpretentious bleakness pulls it
through. If you've ever been
possessed by a dark psyche, then
this is for you...

create a monumental sonic
experience. With the warped
ambience of let me be your faith
where Sice sings with all the angelic
zeal of a choirboy and the gritty
grunge-pop of 'At the Speed of
Sound' and 'Petroleum', it seems
that with this set of songs the Boo
Rads manage to create more texture
and depth in their music than most
bands do put together. A totally
Boo-dacious record!

same sound world as that of Charles
Ives' (d. 1954) 'Sonata No 1*. Ives
is a composer that I have increasing
respect for, who pushed in new
directions around the same time as
Schoenberg/Berg/Webern, not by
using formal, atonal techniques but
rather by trying to re-create the
sound experiences of his boyhood
in a Connecticut town with a crazy,
boisterous mixture of hymn tunes,
brass band music and popular
songs, mingling also with moments
of quiet beauty. His unusual career
is worth a mention: studying
composition at Harvard, he began
to compose, in ' his own style.
Appalled by the conservatism of his
professors he chose to give up an
academic career, started an
insurance- business and made
millions, thus giving him the
financial security to write music any
way he liked, even if it were never
published or performed, until near
the end of his life.

A Four Seasons Blow Job
Albinoni. 6 oboe concertos-Op 9,
Nos 2 in D, 3 in F, 5 in C, 8 in G
minor, 9 in C and 11 in B flat.
Heinz Holliger, oboe; Maurice
Bourgue, Oboe; Maria Teresa
Garatti, harpsichord; 1 Musici.
Albi who? Well Philips are not
giving out a lot of information, but
a quick trip to the encyclopaedia
reveals that Albinoni was a
contemporary of Bach and Handel,
composing in Italy at the same time
as Vivaldi. How does he rate
against the competition? On the
evidence of the Philips C D he rates
very highly; if you enjoy the Four
Seasons then you will surely want
to own this collection of six oboe
concertos. These are in the
traditional form of three contrasting
movements and provide a
wonderful demonstration of
baroque composition and harmony.
The slow second movements in
numbers 2, 3 and 5 match anything
I have heard before. In number 2
the oboe sings a beautiful sustained
note above I Musici that leaves the
listener breathless, in number 3 the
movement is as warm and
languorous as an Italian summer
afternoon should be, and then in
number 5 you seem to move
Concert
Tender is the North—Nielsen
The Barbican's huge festival of all
forms of Scandinavian Art opened
last week with a concert attended by
no fewer than six heads of state
(think of having to sit through all
those national anthems) and
continues throughout November
and into December with an
ambitious and comprehensive
mixture of art, craft, theatre,
cinema and music, supported by
sponsorship from an encouragingly
side range of sources including
Carlsberg and the European Arts
Festival.
Simon Rattle and the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra
began their three-concert cycle last
Friday with the Brahms-influenced
First Symphony and the mature
Third, the Sinfonia Espansiva, truly
a mighty work. From the stabbing
chords of its opening, Rattle
propelled the first movement of the
Third onwards to a huge first
climax, and then, unaccountably, he
held back for a fraction of a second
before the wild, stomping waltz
steadily through a forzen lonely
world. It is good music to play to
your lover or for revision, but best
of all for listening.
There is not much Albinoni in the
record catalogues; if you want these
concertos, and you should, this
recording may be your only hope.
The soloists and I Musici use
modern instruments and the purists
may be disappointed by the absence
of funny squeaks and squawks but
the playing was restrained and
disciplined and would have been
quite acceptable to any self-
respecting Venetian of the 18th
century.
The bad news is the programme
notes; the fat little booklet seemed
to promise all the information
needed for a standard plagiarised
review: imagine disappointment
when I found a one page biography
of Heinz Holliger, two photographs
of the same, and eight pages of
advertisements for Philips CDs.
What a strain, I had to make all this
up myself. (So what do you expect
from a non-musical physicist?).
Don't be put off, buy it soon, enjoy
and get to know it. That way you
will be able to tell your friends that
you discovered it first, before the
advertising men get to it.

music of the development, and the
tension slackened. But it was an
isolated incident in a satisfying
reading which offered sustained
poetry in the slow movement and
fine wind playing in the scherzo. If
in the finale some momentum was
sacrificed for detail, this was surely
the right choice in a movement
which can seem a little less
involving than what has gone
before.
A further attraction of the series
is the inclusion of a Mahler song-
cycle in each concert. All the
qualities which have come to be
associated with Rattle in Mahler
were abundantly present in the Song
of a Wayfarer; springy rhythms,
meticulous detail and, especially at
the end of the ominous third
movement, beautifully feathery
violins and rich, silky cellos. .
Baritone Olaf Baer brought a palette
as varied as the CBSO's to Mahler's
poems of unrequited love, along
with clear, unconstricted head-tone
and a velvety lower register.
