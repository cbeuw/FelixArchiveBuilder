IC Rowers Wobblers Footballers Win
At the "Fours Head of the River
Race" on Saturday the 7th of
November, Imperial College
entered eight crews - Two quad
sculls and three coxed and coxless
fours. The Queen's Tower Boat
Club also had two crews racing.
The squad had been hit by injury
and illness in the final few days of
preperation for this event, with
some last minute changes of key
personnel being enforced. This
proved to be critical in the very
tough competition. IC's senior 1
coxed four were the only boat to
win their division outright, finishing
well up in the overall order, on
times. Several crews were only
seconds off the pace, often losing
out to crews who had started later
in the day and had taken advantage
of the greater tide. There was also
some dispute over the correction of
the provisional results which had
led to two IC crews being denied
pennants.
Both the Queen's Tower boats
won their divisions (senior 2 coxed,
and women's coxless fours).
The club is now back in pairs and
single sculls, laying the groundwork
for the summer regatta season.

A total of 481 crews raced.
With both teams needing a win to
progress to the next round of the
U A U competition, this was always
going to be a needle game. We
came out with the right attitude and
a team of committed players ready
to rise to the occasion. A few well
qualified newcomers bolstered our
impressive line-up; the stage was
set.
After conceding our traditional
warm-up goal, we fought back and
a scarey one man effort by Steve
Law brought the scores level. We
then dominated the first half with
excellent midfield passing play from
Eddy, Samin and John F. It was just
that the final touch was lacking;
sometimes courtesy of those 'men
in black'. Then Holloway were
awarded a consciliary penalty flick
from a front break. They made no
mistake in converting, and we went
into half time 2—1 down.
The second half started with us
applying constant pressure, earning
many short corners. John Brooks
finally put away our overdue goal,
from a narrow angle. We had high
hopes for the last fifteen minutes,
but alas it was not to be. We piled
on the pressure and Holloway
responded in the only way they
knew how: they scored their third
goal with ten minutes to go and
things were not rosy in the State of
Harlington. A prolonged series of
short corners didn't result in
anything tangible, and Holloway
took advantage to put the game
beyond our reach. (2—4).
It was our strongest team of the
season and there was no shame in
the result. We gave our best but
came up short, like a one legged
long jumper.
Team: S Curwood, M Helayel,
D Parkinson, P Higgin, I Haines,

IC Rugby 2nds
IC R F C 2nd IV 3 - RHBNC 0
For the last game in the first round
.of the U A U , IC seconds needed to
pull a win out of the bag. After a
concerted effort from the kick-off
Lee Jefferson turned a penalty into
points mid-way through the first
half. There were plenty of good
drives by IC, and excellent forward
play led by Keith Simpson on the
flank. Rucks and mauls came out in
our favour due to our quick second
and back rows driving New college
down the pitch all the time, and
good cover from hooker Ivor
Crampse and the two props Simon
Fuller and Glenn Khoo.
Due to the clean forward play the
backs were delivered with lots of
nice ball. Captain Karl Dfage, fed
by centres James Wood and Steffan
Tudor, made some ground into
'crash ball' situations, lining up
second phase again for the
forwards. Plenty of runs ended with
no points, to credit RHBNC's
defence so close to the goal line.
The 3-0 score allowed New college
to pressurise us a little in the last
half, but reflecting the play the
score should hve been more like
30-0.
IC lst's continued their quest for the
League Title on Saturday (14th
Nov) by defeating current League
Holders, Kings College with a score
of 2-1.
On a cold and rainy day IC
arrived at Kings College's
sportsground having no intention of
leaving as losers.
A Galloway did a brilliant team
talk, storming into the changing
rooms shouting, T hate Jim, let's
kill Jim, let's f**k King's !',
reference being made to Jim the
Kings trainer.
We went into the game very
strongly, and after missing a few
chances finally scored with a
glancing header from A Galloway,
IC's leading.goal scorer. Kings
managed to pull one back before
half time, but IC's skill and spirit
were to shine in the second half.
IC's dominance in the beginning
of the second half was rewarded by
a goal from the edge of the box by
R Martinez. IC then cooly held off
the King's attacks, with the defense
composed of R Burrows, R Bruce,
T Robson and A Feuton, all playing
brilliantly.
J Mottashed and R Dixon played
some great control football on the
left, whist T Botzios and R
Galloway on the right bedazzled the
King's defense with some great
runs, and particularly with a one-
two backheel move.
S Watson and R Martinez took
complete control of the centre
midfield, leaving M Atherton to do
mostly routine work.
A great team effort which leaves
eveyone in the football club
optimistic for the future.
Norfolk Dribs
U E A 3 DRIBBLERS 0
Following a ridiculously early start
(7.30am) the Dribbers made their
way to Norwich via tube, train, bus,
another train and finally taxi. Kick-
off was at 1 lam, we got there at half
past. They had a full team, we had
eight. Captain Eleanor chose a good
weekend to be unavailable, as she
missed the finest football ever
played by the Dribblers.
Novice keeper Jane played well,
tiping a free kick over the cross-bar
and saving numerous other attempts
by U E A . Unlike Wednesday,
Juliette did not score, neither did
Christine, though not through want
of trying. Fresh from refereeing on
Saturday Julianna took a new lease
of life, along with Paula (whose
voice proved inversely proportional
to her diminutive size). Beej ran like
an international athlete reaching
seemingly impossible-to-get balls,
whilst Arlene and Sharon were
forced to defend like never before,
making it appear almost effortless.
U E A were lucky to score at all
really, but as usual the Dribblers
were victorious in the main event
- the after-match boat race!
