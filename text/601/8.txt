The social clubs estimates for next session
have to be submitted to the Union Finance
Committee this term. I have prepared an
estimate form which has to be completed by
each club and returned to me by January 28.
These forms will be placed in the chairmen's
pigeonholes on Monday. It is important that all
club chairman or treasurers collect a copy.
Any claims submitted after this date will be
d i s r e g a r d e d . A n y r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of the
Communist Society should contact Stephen
Goulder immediately via the Union Office
because this club faces abolition.
Community Action
Well, we're back in action again. Soup runs as
usual. We need help to carry donated clothes
from Holy Trinity Brompton to the action
group room on Sunday evening on February 7.
If you can help, drop your name to Sean
Coyle, EE3.
Are you interested in helping with the Action
Group for handicapped children as featured
o n B B C t e l e v i s i o n ' s Grapevine—Every
S a t u r d a y afternoon, or helping build an
adventure playground for them.
Meetings on Monday at 12:30 in the action
group room, top of the union.
Wind Band
IC Wind Band exists to enable players of
w o o d w i n d a n d brass i n s t r u m e n t s to play
together in a group. There is no required
s t a n d a r d ; we play for fun and anyone is
welcome. N o great commitment is needed.
The band rehearses on Mondays from 5:45
until 7:15pm in the Great Hall and gives two
concerts each term on Tuesdays at lunchtime.
We are having a cheese and wine party after
the rehearsal on Monday, so if you would like
to join us, please come and play and stay
afterwards.
Industrial
Happy new year everybody, and we trust you
had a fun time in the holiday.
This term we will be as busy as ever,
administering a mixture of trips and talks. The
first event is today no less! At 1:00pm in C h e m
Eng L T 1 , a real live trade unionist will present
a talk, entitled 'the Chips are Down' about
the impact of microprocessors on industry.
O n Tuesday, January 19, we have a trip to
the Proctor and Gamble soap factory, meet
Beit A r c h , 12:30pm for good clean fun.
Ian Ross, the Industrial Correspondent of
the B B C , whom you have no doubt seen on
the news, is coming to College on January 29;
more about that in our next few articles, so
watch out!
City & Guilds
It's a busy week to start the term with. Tonight
is the Guilds "for no reason whatsoever" party
with a live band—The Stargazers (hot off
Pebble Mill at One) and a disco. From 8:00 till

O n Tuesday, January 19, there's a General
