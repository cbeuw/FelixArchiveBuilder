Student dies in
climbing tragedy
Peter Robinson, a first year physicist, died tragically during the
Christmas holiday whilst climbing on an IC Mountaineering
C l u b trip to the Cairngorms.
He was in a party of five attemtpting an ice-climb on Hell's
L u m , on December 30, M a r k Bown, a chemist, also sustained
minor injuries but is now fully recovered.
A lull report on the circumstances of the death will be
submitted to IC Union next week. F E L I X would like to extend
sincere condolences to the family and friends of Peter Robinson

consultation with the students
association. This has brought
into question the power of the

bargaining position at present.
Indeed, it has led to a proposal
lo affiliate to the X L ' S , which'
was discussed yesterday.
It is believed that the move
to sell the hall is part of a
money-saving plan which is
necessary in order to expand
the R C M by the opening of a
new opera school.
And now, by popular demand, the

The rest of this bit is extremely important to all club and society
officers. N o w is the time to start preparing your estimates for next year's
expenditure. The only way the Union can continue its high level of
activities is for all wastage to be eliminated. I hope everyone will be
responsible enough so that we don't have to resort to the large scale
"slashing" which happened last year.
Some of you may have noticed my new hair-do, nice isn't it? For those
of you who really like it I'm selling signed photos of me from my office at
£5 each. (Incidentally if you try Jingles on Gloucester Road, ask for Sue,
she's very good.) For your entertainment also, anyone is welcome to
come and try one of my superb curries cooked in my new pressure-
cooker. To book just fill in the form in the Union Office. I also got a radio-
alarm for Christmas, so that I can not get into the office before
eleven—wow!
Incidentally, a certain Director of a certain Royal Choral Society
seemed to think that my little "feeling" was "fine" to use for a rehearsal in
the Concert Hall. I must also add that it gave me great pleasure to hear
people using it (e.g. Opsoc). That's what the piano was bought for, and
soon there will be an easy procedure for anyone who wants to have a
tinkle to do so. Yes, fellow musicians, a first for I C — a reasonable piano
that is readilt
that is readily available for students to play!! (Incidentally, if anyone
would like to borrow my spare banjo, or even to play just ask.)
Well, that's it for the present, thanks for bearing with me (or is it just
bearing me?) See you soon and I wish you all a very enjoyable,
entertaining, stimulating and rewarding 1982.

IC Men thrash
Cambridge Women
A Happy New Year was not
had by the women of the
New Hall Cambridge Uni-
versity Challenge team as
they were resoundingly
slaughtered by the male
chauvinist IC team last
term.
The IC line-up consisted of T.
P i g d e n . G . M a s t e r t o n , A .
G r i f f i t h s , w i t h reserve Z.
Lozinski, under the masterful
l e a d e r s h i p of M a r t i n S.
T a y l o r , h y p n o t i s t e x t r a -
ordinaire.
The heat was on a cold
winter's day in Manchester
on D e c e m b e r 16. T h e I C
team rattled out the starters
for ten in a surprising contrast
to last year's i l l - p r e p a r e d
team.
The final score was 275 t
<
IC. with the paltry 165 to tht
New Hall ladies. '
Martin S. Taylor has urged
us to point owl lhal theii
success was a limited one. as
they didn't manage lo score
with the other team He also
expressed extreme disrespect
for the Union Deputy Presi-
dent, Barney M c C a b e . who
failed to bring " M i k e " . the
I C U mascot, despite I C U
policy to the contrary.
The next heat is on January
27, and the team will willingly
take Spanner & Bolt, as all
the team are Guildsmen.
The successful match will
be broadcast on February 14.
alternatively titled the 'St.
Valentine's Da\ Massacre'.
Mooney gets
his just desserts!
