Dinner-in-Hall
O n page 4 you will find details of this term's
"Dinners in Hall". This title has caused some
confusion in the past and not many people are
certain about the purpose of these events.
The idea really sU-ms from the collegiate
system of Oxford and Cambridge, where a
formal dinner in the place where you live is a
regular event. T o imitate this, to an extent,
Imperial College hold several dinners a term
which anyone (not just those living in halls) can
a t t e n d . A f u n d has been set up w h i c h
subsidises the meals for students. This gives
p e o p l e w h o live in or o u t of C o l l e g e
accommodation the chance to mix with staff
over a meal and is intended to promote social
wellbeing.
Election Fever
This term sees the onset of election fever,
which will soon grasp you all by the throat.
Papers for the sabatical IC posts go up on
, February 11 with husting on M a r c h 4 and
elections o n M a r c h 8 a n d 9. I will warn
candidates for these posts in particular to be
early with their publicity. Every year people
leave things to the last minute, so if you have
considered standing, plan ahead. The last date
on which I will accept completed posters or
h a n d o u t s for p r i n t i n g will be M o n d a y ,
February 22. After that financial penalties will
be imposed and I cannot guarantee that they
will be done in time, or even at all.
Soapbox
A s explained on page 4, this is a revived
feature which is intended to give people a
chance to air their views at greater length than
the letters page may allow. I cannot guarantee
inclusion but will keep articles over for future
inclusion if I receive too many. I do not intend
to impose very great editorial contol over
these articles so you may be as daring,
damning or controversial as you like. This
provides a unique opportunity for free speech
and also means that you will be judged on the
merits of your own arguments by the masses.
So don't be shy—take up the gauntlet and tell
us all about something you feel strongly about.
Crash Pad
Our glorious leader, M r Nick Morton, has
asked me to inform you that if the industrial
action by the train drivers continues, a "crash
pad" will operate in the Union Building. So if
you live out in the sticks you can bring in your
sleeping bag and take up residence until British
Rail resumes normal services. Enquire at the
Union Office for details.
Staff Meeting
There will be a staff meeting today at 12:30pm
in the F E L I X Office. Bring along your bright
ideas for this term. Remember that it's never
too late to join the staff.

mwmwm
I w o n d e r how many of y o u recall A n g u s
McOatup, the drunken cloakroom attendant
at The Inebriated Haggis? After the alcoholic
excesses of last year's Hogmanay, he thought
it prudent to stay dry this year, and so he spent
New Year's Day in the Highlands, watching
the sporran flinging and the haggis dancing at
the Highland Games.
The climax of the games is, of course, the
tossing of the caber, in which each competitor
tries to throw a thirteen foot tree trunk up Billy
Connolly's kilt. At least, it should traditionally
be a thirteen foot pole, uniform in diameter,
and cylindrical in shape; but nowadays many
tossers prefer a shorter length, and so each
caber is 'perforated' by partly sawing it
t h r o u g h ; in this way the c o m p e t i t o r s , by
b r e a k i n g the c a b e r at a n a p p r o p r i a t e
perforation (or perforations) can shorten it
from its original thirteen feet to any whole
number of feet less than thirteen. But sawing
through a caber weakens it, and so to reduce
the possibility of injuring Billy Connolly for life
(or to increase the possibility, depending on
h o w v i o l e n t l y y o u play) the n u m b e r of
perforations is kept to a minimum. Angus has
been passing the time between tosses by
working out where along its length the pole
should be perforated. Any offers?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me at
the FELIX Office please. £5 donated by Mend-

selected at 1:00pm on Wednesday.
Christmas Puzzles
The only person to get three puzzles out of
four completely correct was Zar Amrolia. He
wins the £10 voucher and £5 cash. Other
prizes go to George Chan, Maths 2, Mike
Hodgson, Physics 1 and Andrew Britton,
Maths 3. Congratulations to these and all who
entered, and also to J . Blitz, D o C 3 who won a
competition last term, but whom I forgot to
credit. Cheques for all the above people will be
available in the F E L I X Office on Monday
afternoon. Finally, very many thanks to Mend-
a-Bike for their continuing generosity with
prizes.

Chess Player's Nightmare
1. White had played P(B2)-B4 instead of P-Q5.
2. Black had just played P-QB4. White played
P(N4)xP instead of P(Q5)xP en passant. Of
the four positions this was the hardest, and a
number of people were caught by it.
3. Again Black had just played P-QB4. White
played P(N5)xP en passant instead of P(Q6)-
Q7.
4. White played P-B7 instead of P-Q8=Knight.
Code in the Head
This one was easily the most difficult (?) and I
didn't expect anyone to find all four carols. In
fact, nobody found more than one, although
not everyone found the same one.
The bold face letters, reading in reverse
order, spell 'First Noel'.
Counting A = l , B=2, and so on, the numbers
of letters in each line spell out 'Rudolf the Red'.
Subtracting the numerical values of each
pair of letters (so, e.g. il gives 9, 12, and since
12 - 9 = 3, il gives c) spells out 'Deck the
H a l l s w i t h B o u g h s of H o l l y ' . S p e c i a l
congratulations to Mike Hodgson who was the
only one to crack this code.
Finally replace each capital letter with a 1,
and each lower case letter with a 0 and you
have the numerical values of 'Good King
Wenceslas' in binary! Not an obvious idea, but
fairly well-known (it's described in one of
Martin Gardner's books) and I warned you it
was difficult.
Other solutions next week. A n d now; a
