Astrosoc
This term, as well as regular lectures on
various astronomical topics such as "Hip-
parchus" by Prof Welford on January 19 (i.e.
fhis Tuesday) and "Quantum Gravity" by Dr
Isham on March 23, and observing meetings
(with further talks from Dr Bignall on practical
observing technique), we hope to be able to
take advantage of telemetered information
from the University of Surrey's planetary
sciences satellite U O S A T - O S C A R - 9 . On-
board experiments from which we hope to be
able to collect data, include radiation detectors
for the investigation of auroral displays and a
magnetometer allowing the detection of
geomagnetic storms. The C C D camera
imaging system promises to be the most
interesting (and most comprehensible!) though
as this relays pictures of weather patterns on
earth. However, before we can receive and
use any of this, we need to build up the
relevant circuitry. We have the components,
we have the circuit diagrams, we even have
soldering irons, and, yes, solder—but is there
a n y o n e out there fancies wielding a
soldering iron? The more the merrier of course
come to any one of our meetings (Tuesdays,
Physics LT2, 6:30pm, or alternatively contact
Gary Fuller in Physics 3).

Audiosoc
Is it true, has the Chairman of the Audio
Society defected, only being able to print small
ads in this so-called magazine? Is he exiled to
reside permanently in Chelsea? Does Jo of 84
Granville Rd SW18 really have a decent
system? Is she still going to keep her promise
of taking me out for a meal? The answers to
these questions (and more) are no, no, very
yes(!) and 'I don't know, why don't you ask
her?1
.
I may have been quiet, but certainly not
dead. I have been scheming, planning and now
I bring you not just one but two major
lectures. No, you're not hallucinating, this is
actually happening.
J. Scott Strachan, eminent engineer and
designer of the world famed Syrinx PU1 and 2
tonearms will, in the Quiet Room, QR002,
Sherfield Building this evening at 6:30pm
deliver a lecture and demonstrate equipment
(at the same time as downing a pint) on the
subject of 'Tonearm and Turntable Design'
(Hear it like it is folks, from the pros.)
The second lecture will be in the same place,
QR002 at 6:30pm on Wednesday, February 3
and this time Mr Mike Daniels will euphemisc
on the sales directions of audio companies.
Mike Daniels is one of the sales managers of
D W Labs, the company that bring you such
goodies as the Gale loudspeakers and the
Carver Cube magnetic amplifier and Mr
Daniels will also be demonstrating this
equipment. What a great man! Come along
and bring a friend and an open mind.
T h e I C E u r o p e a n N u c l e a r D i s a r m a m e n t
groups has arranged, through the Humanities
Dept, an excellent series of lectures for this
term under the title "Nuclear War in Europe?"
Critical decisions are going to be made over
the next few years on which not only our
defence but also our very survival will depend.
C a n you afford not to listen to the arguments
from both sides which will be presented this
term? Unless you plan to live for the rest of
your life with your head in the sand you will
finally have to confront and take a stand on
these issues—and this lecture series could be a
fine place to start.
All of the talks will be given in Physics L T 1 .
The full list is:
Tuesday, January 19 "Nuclear Weapons in
Europe", Field Marshal the Lord Carver.
Tuesday, January 26 "The Soviet 'Threat'
and British Defence Policy", Professor Robert
Neild.
Tuesday, February 2 " U K Defence—The
Neutrality Option", Alan Clark, Tory M P for
Plymouth Sutton.
Tuesday, February 9 "Nuclear Deterrence—
F a c t or F i c t i o n " A debate between L o r d
Chalfont and Professor Michael Pentz.
Dancing
O n November 28 IC Dancing Club hosted all
the other London University Dancing Clubs
(and Cambridge) at the London Ball—a series
of friendly competitions, some in a lighter vein
t h a n o t h e r s , i n t e r s p e r s e d w i t h g e n e r a l
dancing and a display by two professional
Latin-American dancers. The event was highly
successful, and the J C R was packed for the
whole of a very enjoyable evening.
The Dancing Club Dinner & Dance two
weeks later also proved to be a good night
out—having eaten our fill, we danced to a live
band until the small hours.
N o w that some of you have missed two of
the best social events of the academic year,
we're going to give you yet another opportunity
to learn how to put one foot in front of another
without treading on someone else's toes—not
quite as easy as it sounds when you're on a
crowded dance floor.
O n Tuesday, January 19, at 7:30pm in the
J C R , we are starting another beginners' class
in b a l l r o o m a n d L a t i n - A m e r i c a n dancing.
Hopefully by March 5 all of those who have
been brave enough to take their first faltering
steps will have the chance to represent IC at
the Inter-Varsity Dancing Competition in the
"Off Beat" event—a team effort which we
usually do well in.
Whether you just want to learn a social skill,
or whether you intend to be the best thing
s i n c e s l i c e d b r e a d , y o u ' v e got to start
somewhere—so how about investing 40p in
IV2 hours professional tuition by coming along
to the lesson on Jan 19.
(NB: We now also have an Intermediate
Class at 7:30pm in the J C R on Wednesdays).
Hamsoc
Fed up with C B ? Bored with IC Radio? Why
not get onto the airwaves with amateur radio.
This term Hamsoc will be running a series of
lectures for those of you wishing to pass the
Radio Amateurs Exam, an essential require-
ment for an amateur licence.
To start things off there'll be a talk just giving
an introduction to what's involved in taking the
exam and what you'll be able to do once you
have a licence, there'll also be a demonstration
of some typical equipment as well, so if you're
interested come along to R m 1207 Elec Eng on
W e d n e s d a y , J a n u a r y 20 at 1:00pm. M o r e
details are available from Julian Cooch, Ext
3000 or Michael Bull, Ext 3035.
Debsoc
O n Thursday, January 21, there will be a
lunchtime debate on the Socialism versus
Captialism theme featuring speakers from IC
Conservative Society and the Socialist Party of
Great Britain. Further details will appear in the
pre-debate publicity. If you would like to join
t h e D e b a t i n g S o c i e t y c o n t a c t D e r m o t
M c C a u l e y or C h r i s Lee via M a t h s letter-
racks—we only bite when angry.
SF Soc
It was January 15 1982, but for four and a half
billion people it would soon be January 18 1982,
and people would flock to M e c h Eng 220 to see
Time After Time, a spiffing comedy thriller in
which H . G . Wells pursues Jack the Ripper into
1979, s t a r r i n g D a v i d W a r n e r , M a l c o l m
McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, with a few
laughs and a bit of blood. Recommended.
I trust you were all aghast at what the Beeb
did to 2001-A Space Odyssey, that other
slighly more famous comedy thriller. I know I
was. Notice to rich film fans: tomorrow the
Scala is showing the Star Trek blooper real
Those who do not understand that would not
be interested. Notice to book fans: Timescope
and Riddiey Walker out in paperback. Notice
to S F Soc bulletin fans: author out to lunch.
But where have all the jokes gone? Is it the
weather? The F T Index? The Editor? The
sinister little men I see out of the corners of my
eyes who vanish when I look at them? Or
perhaps I dreamt it all. No, something must
have happened to give me the vivid nightmares
which make me wake up screaming the lyrics
of Dancing Cheek to Cheek. W h o has
kidnapped all the inspectors on the under-
ground? What really happened to Ambrose
Bierce? H o w should I know?
