Dear Mark
In vour issue of Dew-nil Xt 4
von published a letter from
N i c k G r e e n in w h i c h he
alleged (hat Professor Hartley
is currently negotiating the
sale of one of the College's
most valuable resources in
industry: the fermentation
pilot plant. H e quoted as his
authority the ,\m Scientist.
Professor Hartlev is doing
no such thing. The pilot plant
is not for sale and could not.
for many reasons, be sold. It is
the case that the Governing
B o d y has a u t h o r i s e d the
examination ol proposals with
a v i e w to i m p r o v i n g the
income derived from the pilot
plant by fuller use ol spare
capacity.
There are a number ol such
proposals and no decision has
been taken.
}'mos sincerely

College Secretary
Dear Sir
I write in reply to the letter
from a Garden Hall resident
that you published in the last
F E L I X of last term. I am
writing because I feel that you
could not have checked its
factual content and I cannot
let it go unchallenged. The
letter concerned the laundry
in Weeks H a l l and was a
complete tissue of fabrication,
containing not one truthful
statement. In giving the facts
behind the current contro-
versy I shall not lower myself
to the level of this obviously
extremely unpleasant person
by being abusive, but will try-
to, in spite of my extreme
a n n o y a n c e , give the lacts
objectively and politely. They
are as follows.
The laundry in the base-
ment of Weeks Hall is pro-
vided as part of the facilities
lor the Hall and is intended to
he used by the residents of the
H a l l only. Hence the notice to
this elfecl on the door which
has been there lor at least the
last live years. The lock on the
laundry door is of the same
type as the front door and
thus will accept the residents
front door keys. It also has
been thus for at least the last
ive years. Hence the state-
ment made by your ollensive
correspondent to the ellect
that there was a petty-minded
conspiracy to lock out Garden
H a l l residents is a complete
lie.
There has been no recent
changing of locks. The truth is
very far from this. Most, if not
all Weeks residents would be
happy to share their laundry
and were in fact doing so last
term when they heard of the
misfortune of Garden Hall
whose washing machine had
broken d o w n . T h i s happy
s i t u a t i o n w o u l d doubtless
have continued if it were not
for the totally unreasonable
b e h a v i o u r of s e e m i n g l y a
great number ol Garden Hall
residents. Towards the end ol
last term large numbers of
them would take over the
laundry for very long periods
of t i m e i n t i m i d a t i n g the
rightful users by their aggres-
sive and uncivil attitude and
preventing their access.
A d d i t i o n a l l y , a t u m b l e
driver was broken by putting
a l a r g e a m o u n t ol s o a p
p o w d e r i n i t , the i r o n i n g
b o a r d was b u r n t s e v e r a l
times. Weeks Hall residents
had their washing removed
from the driers belore it was
dry and the laundry was left
very untidy with litter and
soap powder strewn across the
floor.
It should be noted here
that if this was how Garden
H a l l residents treated their
own laundry then it is not
surprising that it has broken
down.
C o n c e r n i n g your corres-
pondent's assertion that it was
official p o l i c y to lock out
Garden Hall residents this is
most certainly not the case.
But w h o c a n b l a m e the
individual Weeks Hall stu-
dent who chooses to protect
his washing whilst he is away
by locking the door.'
II Garden Hall residents
would like to use Weeks Hall
l a l t n d r y this year t hen I
would suggest that they write
to Weeks H a l l C o m m i t t e e
apologising for their disgrace-
fu I be ha v i o u r last t e r m.
offering to reimburse Weeks
H a l l lor the damage they
perpetrated and asking per-
mission to use the laundry
s p a r i n g l y a n d at off-peak
times for which they would be
prepared to make a contribu-
tion to the maintenance costs.

,S»,
Stan Kearns, former South-
side and Holland C l u b bar
manager has now retired and
M r M o r t o n tells us that tin-
poor chap is very ill. As a
result of this M r M o r t o n
p r o p o s e d M r K e a r n s for
Honorary Life Membership
of IC U n i o n at Council last
term. H e felt it would be a
nice gesture.
Writing as an irate Honor-
ary L i f e M e m b e r of the
Union, I feel it is an insult to
mysell and other life members
l o r s u c h a p e r s o n to be
nominated by the President.
At best M r K e a r n s was
s
extremclv nasty, at worst,
extremely extremely nasty,
c o n t i n u a l l y i n t o x i c a t e d on
duty and on one occasion told
an elderly lady to " F u c k off,
you old cow". M y mother
wasn't at all impressed.
O n the Bar Committee last
year, M r Morton expressed
loud unfavourable opinions
concerning M r Kearns and
his p o o r h a n d l i n g of the
Southside Bar. To change his
opinion simply because the
poor chap is ill is the sign of a
weak president.
As for Stan Kearns, he has
been awarded Life Member-
ship by Council, proving how
stupid they all are.

Steve Marshall
Dear Sir
I am writing to complain
about your presumptious and
pre-emptive action in having
vour name placed on the
F E L I X Editors' board despite
having only produced a dozen
or so issues. At least the Union
Executive have the decency to
refrain from awarding U G A s
to each other until later in the
term.

Dear Sii
W i l l i reference to the lasl
F E L I X you published in the
autumn term — 600 issues
old. and Christmas — win
the u s u a l , b o r i n g c l a p . '
Thanks, but don't bothering
commenting.:
\\ c were really looking
forward to a bumper issue
with lots ol fun. and expected
better. (Yes. we know your
whatnot was ill and you had
to find a replacement, but )
O n page 12. you ask lor
more spacelillers, so whv were
many small ads and Christ-
mas w ishes to some people not
printed.' E v e n though vou
complain about the number
ol ads sent in (quote "tut. tut,
tin over the top boys'") —,
and we do agree with vou that
the number ol ads sent in was
a bit excessive, we had hoped
vou would have printed mosl
ol them.
