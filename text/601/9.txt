The Mayor of Zalamea by Pedro Calderon
de la B a r c a in a v e r s i o n by A d r i a n
Mitchell. Directed by Michael Bogdanov.
The Olivier, National Theatre.
In August 1580, troops were massing in
Zalamea, a small Spanish town, for what was
to become a successful assault on Portugal.
This was the Spain of Philip II where Holy
Wars brought about the conquest of vast
d o m a i n s . These historical facts form the
background of the play The Mayor of Zalamea
by Calderon, the great 17th Century Spanish
playwright who still remains one of Spain's
greatest dramatists (the other being Lope de
Vega). In some respects he is akin to our own
Shakespeare. Calderon himself was incredibly
versatile: he was a dramatist of superb wit and
intellect, a magnificent swordsman who fought
m a n y duels, an a c c o m p l i s h e d pursuer of
women and, finally in life, a priest. His plays
were prolific in number and extraordinary in
variety. H e wrote tragedies and histories,
comedies of manners, mythological plays and
dramas of chivalry and philosophy.
The troops are given shelter in Zalamea by a
farmer, a man of principle and honour. But no
sooner does the rough brigade enter the town
when the captain is determined to lay his
hands on the beautiful farmer's daughter. His
determination allows nothing to stand in his
way and as may be feared he succeeds in
attaining a girl only by raping her. Spaniards at
the time of the play and of the events upon
w h i c h the play is based were especially
sensitive in matters of honour. Honour in the
form of virginity is the keynote of The Mayor

The National Theatre production of the
Oresteia is a rare and long awaited event.
F r o m the L a n d of A e s c h y l u s (b. 5 2 5 B C ) ,
founder of European theatre, it is one of the
most powerful works in all drama. The play
tells in three successive parts an epic story of
blood-guilt, vengence and reconciliation, and
concerns the gods of the House of Atreus.

Troy and is killed by his wife Clytemnestra.

of Zalamea. In fact El Honor lies at the core of
much of the Spanish Golden Age drama. The
culprit is brought to trial by the newly-elected
Mayor of the town who ironically turns out to
be the victim's father.
Completing the narration of events would
not only spoil potential enjoyment but would
also oversimplify or even belittle the play. It is a
great m a s t e r p i e c e that has b e e n a c t e d
continuously in Spain since it was written in
about 1644. The timelessness of the play and
the reasons why it will continue to delight
audiences for many generations to come lie in
its masterful blend of contrasts. It is at once a
eventually attains to the annoyance of the
Furies.
In keeping with the ancient tradition, the
entire cast in the production use masks, and
this forces nearly all one's attention on the
dialogue. The masks certainly remind me how
important facial expression is in drama. The
dialogue is poetic, relentless in dramatic
intensity and somewhat monotonous in tone,
and starting at 5:00pm the play certainly

accompanying music provided by percussion,
wind and harp is simple and imaginative and
provides added poignancy to moments of
drama. The Olivier's auditorium complements
the work marvellously. The fan-shaped theatre
with open stage and banked seats are based
on the ancient amphitheatres where the great
Greek dramas were once performed.

contrast with the brutal, naked sound of the
cannon, and all human types from the King of
Spain to the common tart make an appearance
in the play. A very strong cast is headed by
Daniel Massey and Michael Bryant who both
give outstanding performances. This is the first
production to be transferred from the National
Theatre's small C o t t e s l o e Theatre to the
Olivier, and this surely demonstrates its wide
appeal. This is a play that I cannot recommend
too highly.
A modern audience seeing The Oresteia
largely lacks, of course, the shared culture
w h i c h was familiar to all who witnessed
performances in the Fifth Century B C . In his
plays, Aeschylus reflected the issues of his
own day as well as drawing on legends known
to all his contemporaries such as the epic
poems of Homer. The legends made up a
pretty comprehensive history of the world as
the ancient Greeks knew it. To Harrison, the
director of the play, the main social factor
motivating the tensions and the apparent
resolution of The Oresteia was what Friedrich
Engels called "the historical defeat of the
female sex"; the transition from the old world
of m a t r i a r c h y to the new w o r l d of male
domination, female subjection and property
rights assured by inheritance in the male line.
In the time of Aeschylus, Athenian women
were unfree. "The best reputation a woman
can have is not to be spoken of among men,
either for good or for evil" claimed Pericles, and
"by nature the male is superior, the woman
inferior; therefore the man rules and the
woman is ruled" stated Aristotle. It is said that
the figure of Clytemnestra in The Oresteia
probably resembles what many men today fear
will be the u l t i m a t e result of w o m e n ' s
liberation; a terrifying figure capable of taking
her husband's life in her hands. "The new
world," says Harrison, "the world of Zeus and
Apollo, has continued unbroken and almost
unchanged until our own time. Now however it
faces a challenge from radical feminism. And
the insights that have emerged from that
movement are crucial to our understanding of
The Oresteia and the conflicts Aeschylus
portrayed in it."
