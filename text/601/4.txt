Charles Darwin
and Creationists
by Frank James
This year witnesses the centenary of the death
of one of Britain's greatest scientists —
Charles Darwin. Unfortunately this coincides
with the rise of an opposition to Darwinism
from those who term themselves 'creationists'.
I will discuss their motivation for holding this
belief later. The kernal of their opinions, so far
as the development of life is concerned, is that
all the species of plant and animal life were
formed by acts of special creation during the
past six thousand years. (An Irish Archbishop
'calculated' this value of the age of the earth in
the s e v e n t e e n t h c e n t u r y ) . F o s s i l s are
explained as the remains of animals killed off
during the universal flood.
So far as I am concerned people are free to
believe such myths or not as they please (there
are still flat-earthers after all). But 1 strongly
o b j e c t to p e o p l e h o l d i n g s u c h b e l i e f s
attempting to force such contentions down
other people's throats in the name of truth and
science. They quite seriously believe, and mis-
use modern philosophical arguments to justify
this belief, that creationism has the same
theoretical status as Natural Selection. They
f u r t h e r say that t h e y h a v e the s a m e
institutional structure as modern science. And
that among their adherents there are several
doctorates in biology. O n closer examination
the degree awarding bodies of most of thesr
people are universities in the southern United
States — the sort of institutions from which
Ian Paisley 'gained' his doctorate.
N o w all this is pure propaganda on the part
of the creationists to spread their point of view
in the e d u c a t i o n a l s y s t e m a n d to gain
respectability. If we let their views predominate
and do no! use reason to show that their views
are absurd then there is the possibility that
their views might spread in this country as they
have already done in the United States.
The creationists appear to be dissatisfied
with a materialistic account of the development
of man. Yet what can science do but discuss
the nature of the material world? To advance
theories which in their very nature cannot be
substantiated by any direct material evidence
is unscientific to say the least. O n the other
h a n d D a r w i n i s m d o e s a c c o u n t for the
evolution of life and also for the evidence
without any need to impose c o n v o l u t e d
interpretations or resort to non-scientific
arguments.
What is the motive of these people? The
only answer I can find is power. By setting up a
system for the development of life which is not
dependent on chance, and which within itself is
logically coherent (Alice Through the Looking
Class is incidentally logically coherent given
the initial postulates), the creationists argue
that this will lead to a secure society. They
cannot tolerate a pluralistic society in which
people can do as they please. They want to
enforce a system of belief on others from
which no deviation is permitted and thus
ensure their control over society.
They ignore the evolutionary fact that man
is an animal and should be proud to be so. It is
after all by pure chance that any of us are here
at all, and I do not see what is so very odd in
accepting that our species is also here by
chance. If Darwin knew that there were still
creationists in existence 100 years after his
death he would be spinning in his grave in
Westminster Abbey.
