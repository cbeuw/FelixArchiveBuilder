Students
To those of us who work here the Student
Services Office seems remarkably like the
centre of the universe, so it always comes
as a rather nasty shock when, in moments
of casual conversation with a student or
member of staff in another part of College,
we are met with blank expressions and
remarks like "where's that?" or "what do
you do t h e r e ? " , when we h a p p e n to
mention where we come from or what we
do. Admittedly we have only been in
existence (in our present place and
structure) for one year, so to make the
event and spread the news a little further
here again is a brief rundown of our
various activities.
. College Accommodation
Application and billing for all the College
accommodation allocated to students
begins with us, including a limited number
of flats for families.
Private Sector
There are quite a number of landlords and
landladies in West L o n d o n who now
contact us rather than other agencies
w h e n their flats or b e d s i t s b e c o m e
available, while we attract new sources of
accommodation through advertisements
in London newspapers at regular intervals.
This means that we always have some
current information on vacancies through-
out the year with an extra effort to gain
more places at the b e g i n n i n g of the
academic year and each new term. If we
cannot provide y o u with the type of
accommodation you are looking for an
Accommodation Guide may be of use with
a list of agencies and legal and practical ad-
vice.
Serviced
Legal Advice
This includes all kinds of legal problems
from traffic offences to making claims
under the small claims procedure in the
county court.
In certain cases where you may have to
have a solicitor, as for example, you would
if you wanted someone to represent you in
a magistrates court, we have lists of
solicitors who do legal aid work—which is
free if y o u r i n c o m e is low e n o u g h —
together with the areas of the law that they
s p e c i a l i s e in. T h e s e lists a l s o n o t e
solicitors who speak languages other than
English.
Landlord Problems
These can be many and varied. One of the
problems is knowing just what your rights
are. Other problems, such as an imminent
breakdown in the relationship between
tenant and l a n d l o r d , may be h e l p e d
through an intermediary such as ourselves.
Consumer Rights
Legislation over the last few years has
given the consumer considerable pro-
tection. However, it is still up to the
individual to find out how he stands in any
transaction that appears to have gone
wrong, and summon up enough energy to
commence battle! This is where we can
provide reinforcements with advice and
s o m e t i m e s direct intervention when
appropriate.
Immigration/Home Office Problems
This is an area which may require the skills
of specialist organisations or solicitors
which we can put you in touch with
although for routine enquiries we should
be able to provide most of the answers.
A fairy's assistant
tells all
Insurance
We have quite a selection of leaflets on
m a n y types of i n s u r a n c e , i n c l u d i n g
bicycles, possessions and holidays. We
may also be able to help sort out problems
concerning claims.
Covenants
Here is a useful way of supplementing your
income by reclaiming tax paid by your
parents on their contribution to your grant.
F o r m s e x p l a i n i n g the p r o c e d u r e are
available from Student Services.
Benefits
We have most of the Department of Health
and Social Security leaflets relevant to
students, such as those on all aspects of
the NHS, unemployment benefit, supple-
mentary benefit, and s o c i a l s e c u r i t y
agreements with the E E C and other
countries. Our own information sheet also
explains the rent allowance and rebate
schemes.
Grants
Help with chasing up recalcitrant LEAs,
advice on eligibility for grants, details of
certain discretionary allowances and lists
of educational charities can be provided.
Miscellaneous
This includes such things as reference
books on holiday jobs and w o r k i n g
holidays, while we also aim to act as
intermediaries between those looking for
tutoring work and those in n e e d of
tutoring.
If there's a n y t h i n g else y o u n e e d
information on topics not mentioned here,
come and see us in the Student Services
Office. If we can't help, there's always our
book of useful phone numbers.
