The penthouse flats above the Southside Hails of
Residence have now been filled, after lying empty for a
term. However, the new residents are not to be allowed
access to their accommodation by the lifts of the
penthouse level, but have agreed to use the Tizard/Selkirk
gallery level and stairs as their means of entry.
The condition that the resi-
dents could not use the lilt to
the penthouse level was made
quite clear to the applicants,
and those who were successful

terms. Whilst not disputing
that the condition has been
fully accepted, F E L I X feels

w h i c h has s u r r o u n d e d the
whole question of the South-
side penthouse Oats.
Last term the Hats were left
empty, primarily due to the
fact that D r P a u l J o w i t t .
F a l m o u t h K e o g h W a r d e n
was 11 v i n g i n o n e w h i 1 e
another, larger flat was being
d e c o r a t e d for his use. It
appears that the condition of
the second Hat was not good
enough for him (although it
was lor the previous occupant.
D r Frank Potter). This lost
the College revenues of the
order of ^2,000.
N o w we see a I n r t h e r
example of this short-sighted
attitude. T h e students living
in the flats are not being
a l l o w e d to use t h e l i f t s

wardens. Surely this is an
example of the " w e don't

d o o r " prejudice mentality
being applied to a group of
students.
It is such a shame that D r
Jowitt above a l l , who is a
former student and Deputy-
P r e s i d e n t o f t h e U n i o n ,
should be so petty. H e ap-
parently did a lot of work for
students and would probably
have been writing an article
like this himself eight or so
years ago.
So cut the pettiness and
reverse this decision, South-
side wardens. Remember that
you and your neighbours are
truly on the same level.
