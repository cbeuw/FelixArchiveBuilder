Russia Dies Laughing: Jokes from Soviet
Russia, edited by Zhanna Dolgopolova,
Andre Deutsch Â£4.95 (hardback).
Joke books are usually pitiful rubbish and this
one is about as entertaining as most. But
because of its theme it's on a different level from
m o s t j o k e b o o k s , or r a t h e r i t ' s o n t w o
levels at once. The book's designed to sell to
the semi-intellectual anti-Soviet market (the
sort of p e o p l e w h o are upset if y o u call
Solzhenitsyn boring) as well as to the simple-
minded (the sort of people who avidly read
Irish joke books and the like). Apart from its
political character the book is much the same
as a n y o t h e r j o k e b o o k , w i t h a s m a l l
proportion of good jokes filled out with trashy
jokes, large classification headings and plenty
of blan k s p a c e . T h e r e are relatively few
reprinted jokes, I only found nine. Illustrations
by J a k accompany about every tenth joke. Of
the two hundred or so jokes about fifteen or
twenty are a c t u a l l y funny a n d p e r h a p s a
hundred are mildly amusing. About a quarter
of the jokes have little or no connection with
the U S S R . Apart from the anti-Soviet jokes
there are jokes about student life, war, sex,
medicine, families, Jews and anti-Semites (a
section of anti-Semitic jokes is followed by
some Jewish anti-anti Semitic jokes as though
to m a k e up for it). T h e r e are two anti-
American jokes (one of them quite good).
This is one of the better jokes:
Brezhnev was being conducted around
hell. " W e l l , " the d e m o n s say to h i m ,
"choose yourself a torment." They pass
sinners sizzling in giant frying pans. "What
about that one?" ask the demons. " N - n -
n o . . . " says Brezhnev, trembling. " N o t that
one." They go on and see sinners being
beaten with burning brands. "What about
that?" ask the demons. "N-n-no..." says
Brezhnev, trembling. " N o t that." They go
further and suddenly they see Krushchev in
bed with Brigitte Bardot. "That's the one I
want," cries Brezhnev. " H a ha ha!" laugh
the d e m o n s . " T h a t ' s Brigitte B a r d o t ' s
torment."
A more typical example:
H o w do you relate to the Soviet govern-
ment?
Like a wife: part habit, part fear, and wish
to G o d I had a different one.
Many of the jokes aren't really jokes at all,
they're just meant to make you reflect on
Soviet (especially Stalinist) faults. Some of
them are quite thoughtful, like this one which
is p r o b a b l y meant as a sort of m i n i a t u r e
parable of Soviet history:
S t a l i n , K r u s c h c h e v a n d B r e z h n e v are
travelling in a train. The train breaks down.
" F i x it!" orders Stalin. They repair it but the
Hockey
" I say Carruthers, dashed good wheeze of
yours, coming to see this m a t c h . "
"Chute, damned exciting stuff, Presidents
X I g e t t i n g a g o o d p a s t i n ' , C o a t e s w o r t h
showing off as usual. Reminds me of that
never to be forgotten game in er "
" A h yes, well I remember the 1946 I n d i a n
tour, i n the third test they missed almost as
many chances as young G a r m s in the first
half today."
" I must admit, we must be getting a bit
desperate when we have to rely on Geoff
Ayers to put the ball under the bar for once!"
" S p l e n d i d stuff, I think fitness is beginning
to tell, j u d g i n g by the way Roger Davey is
turning b l u e ! "
" O n e all at half-time, I haven't known
such excitement since Bradman's 100th test."
" W a k e up H e n r y , they're starting again. I
do believe G a r m s has scored."
" D o n ' t be ridiculous, no I C centre forward
has scored since that never to be forgotten
goal by er...."
" W e l l dash it all, he's done it again and
Bell's added another! Splendid goals, well
played you chaps! I say H e n r y do wake up, I
think P h i l W e b b could do with borrowing
your wheelchair."
" Y e s , H m , I see what you mean, rather
wobbly on the old pins w h a t ! ? "
" A h a , there goes the final whistle, up to
the bar H e n r y , mine's a double scotch."
" I haven't heard a whistle like that since
the 1867 Stockton to D a r l i n g t o n Express.

Special thanks to D r D a v e H a r d w i c k for
organising the game and to M r s H a r d w i c k
for an excellent tea afterwards.
Everyone realised that a mistake h a d been
made when our beloved President said he
would play when asked at short notice. T h e
rest of the team h a v i n g assembled at 9:00am
the skipper was given the job of dragging M r
M o r t o n out of bed half a n hour later.
H a v i n g lost the toss I C were inserted. O u r
now famous opening partnership, spurred on
by M r S i m p k i n ' s parents (our longest serving
supporters), gave us a modest start. B y l u n c h
we were 76-4 at w h i c h point the game could
have gone either way very quickly. I C picked
up with scores of 55 from C l a r k e , 29 from
Tear (no one thought he was capable) a n d 24
from Silva. W e were a l l out just after 4:00pm
for 189.
H a v i n g had his first two balls for four,
Eastland was spurred on to pick up a wicket
in the first over of Churchill's innings. I C on
the whole bowled fairly well a n d picked u p
wickets quite regularly in the early stages.
W e r e it n o t for s l o p p y f i e l d i n g a n d
dropped catches we w o u l d probably have
won. T h e result however was a draw. R o c k
M i n t o n then led the way to the bar i n an
effort to get every pissed. Best performances
were from T e a r (4 cream eggs), S i m p k i n (2
c r e a m eggs a n d c h u n d e r ) a n d H i m m e r s
(many chunders).

The publication of an anti-Soviet joke book
suggests that things can't really be all that bad
in the U S S R if they're able to make jokes
about it. (At least this is true of the compilers,
identified as " A N , R N and K S " , an architect,
an artist and a writer, who are probably much
better off than most people in the U S S R . ) Joke
books wouldn't be compiled by people in
constant fear of arrest, and the editor says in
the introduction that "Brezhnev does not yet
put people in prison for telling jokes". (The
publishers seem to want to give the book a
more anti-Soviet slant than it really has; the
b l u r b says that " R u s s i a n s w h o joke...are
running risks we could not dream of...") It's
hard to tell if the jokes reflect any popular
discontent in the U S S R . The attitude of the
c o m p i l e r s s e e m s to be s o r t of c y n i c a l
acceptance of the Soviet system, they regard it
a n d its rulers with s k e p t i c i s m a n d s o m e
c o n t e m p t but they s e e m to see it as a n
unalterable fact of life. M o c k i n g jokes wouldn't
be made by people who hated their govern-
ment (for example the Iranians who hated the
Shah). But being laughed at is harder to ignore
than being hated, and the Soviet authorities
would have to take reprisals on a Stalinist scale
to stop the jokes spreading. In the West, the
publication of this book, feeble though most of
it is, will certainly have the effect of making the
public still more sympathetic to Soviet and
Eastern European dissidents. The dissidents
(or at least some of them) are exploiting the
faCt that jokes are almost irresistable, a highly
effective way of getting people on your side, a
fact which a lot of other political and semi-
political movements have failed to grasp.
