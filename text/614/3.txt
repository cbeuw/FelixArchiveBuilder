Awards were made to: N . Childe-
Harmer, A . Edwards, P. Green-
street, M . Ledwold, D. Thomp-

M r Nick Childe-Harmer also

Double delay
The I C U Council meeting and
the inter-CCU swimming gala
advertised for last Monday in this
term's F E L I X calendar were
both cancelled this week and
both rescheduled for Monday,
May 11.
The swimming gala will now
be held in the Sports Centre at
6:30pm a n d w i l l i n c l u d e a
Presidents' race and an inter-
C C U water polo match.
The cancellation of Council
was due to Honorary Secretary
Marco Ledwold failing to send
out notification. M r Ledwold has
since gone to Sweden to represent
IC at the sixth International
C o n f e r e n c e of S t u d e n t s of
Technology (INCOST).
However the three events are
thought to be unconnected.

Obituary: Nigel Creatorex
Dr Nigel Greatorex, former Subwarden of Falmouth Hall, was killed
in an automobile accident on May 1 in the New Forest near Beaulieu
in Hampshire. Lord Montague of Beaulieu was driving the other car
.and escaped serious injury.
As an undergraduate at Imperial College from 1971 to 1974, Nigel
gained a first class honours degree in Electrical Engineering at the age
of 19 winning the Sylvanius P. Thompson medal and the Willis
Jackson Memorial Scholarship in his second year.
As a postgraduate he gained his PhD in 1977 through research into
linear induction motors with Professor Eric Laithwaite, and was at the
same time Subwarden of Falmouth Hall, Assistant Editor of I C O N ,
Captain of the Croquet Club and an active sailor in the Solent based
Contessa 32 fleet.
After leaving I C to work at G E C i n North London, Nigel
maintained close social and professional contacts with IC. His funeral
was held at Holy Trinity Church in Prince Consort Road on Tuesday.
He was an active supporter of the Institution of Electrical Engineers
and was the schools liason officer of the I E E Young London Members
Committee.
His many friends at Imperial College are planning to donate a
trophy in his memory for the Contessa 32 class in the annual Cowes
Week Regatta, in which Nigel had crewed annually since 1976.
