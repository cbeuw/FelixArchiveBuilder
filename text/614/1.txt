Sir Keith Joseph described himself as "thoroughly
inadequately educated" at a meeting in Huxley Lecture
Theatre 213 last Tuesday. A member of the audience later
referred to him as "a fossil" in a question on the Falkland
crisis.
The meeting was organised by the Conservative Society and the
crowd of 150 included the Rector, L o r d Flowers.
Sir K e i t h has been a leading figure in the Conservative party for
over twenty-five years and has served under four different P r i m e
Ministers. H e admitted that the country had been going downhill since
he became involved in government, a view echoed by a questioner.
He spoke for about fifteen minutes and later answered questions for
thirty minutes. Starting his speech, he outlined the usual Conservative
policy of the necessity for a sound trading base, before talking about
education in particular. H i s views were the same as those expressed by
his j u n i o r Minister W i l l i a m Waldegrave last F r i d a y (see elsewhere).
Sir K e i t h was asked about overseas students, teacher training, his
"disastrous" term as Minister for Social Services and later Industry,
the Falklands and both the quantity and quality of engineers being
produced by universities. However, Sir K e i t h was not asked any
questions on the future levels of student grants or loans.

And now for the facts
M r W i l l i a m Waldegrave, J u n i o r Minister responsible for Higher
E d u c a t i o n a d d r e s s e d the S t a n d i n g C o n f e r e n c e of University
Information Officers at 170 Queensgate last Friday.
H e warned the universities that remarks like "the government is
bringing our institution to its knees" may well cause the public to lose
confidence in higher education. H e recommended that universities
work harder on developing relationships with the local community and
the public at large. H e included industry in the general public,
stressing the importance of obtaining increased financial support from
research contracts etc.
W h e n answering questions, the Minister said that if the current
cutbacks meant a 5% increase in external funding in fifteen years the
whole campaign could be viewed as a success.
U n i o n President N i c k M o r t o n said that M r Waldegrave was " f a r
more reasonable than his boss Sir K e i t h J o s e p h " a n d was pleased that
the Department of E d u c a t i o n and Science's view was gradually
moving toward's the U n i o n ' s own view.
