Dear Mark
T h e F E L I X r e p o r t i n g
really is deteriorating. O n the
front page of issue 613 you
quote me as saying " w e l l I
s u p p o s e t h a t ' s f o u r f e w e r
• social colours we'll be a w a r d -
i n g . " I n fact I said, " w e l l ,
- that's five fewer social colours
we'll be a w a r d i n g . " Y o u may
wish to ignore the reserve, M r
Z i g m u n t Lozcinski, but I do
not. I know he was an integral
. part of the team.
Furthermore, F E L I X re-
ported that I won the beer-
drinking competition at the
nearby Pineapple. Hogwash!
Llost by a distance. I was last
to leave the hostelry after
great problems handling my
third, cold, fizzy excuse for a
pint of bitter.
A n y w a y , w e l l d o n e the
team (all five) on getting so
far in the competition and my
thanks to the loyal supporters.

Dancing
The Inter-Varsity Dancing Competition and Ball are organised annually
by the Inter-Varsity Dancing Association. Apart from spectating at this
colourful event, each affiliated English University enters a team to
compete for individual and team trophies.
O n M a r c h 5 the team and a coachload of supporters headed for
Southampton. B y this stage, we had bought two new 'body stockings' for
the female Latin-American dancers, which were rather daring to say the
least, so with these, the new hairdos, and Vicky's specially-dyed pink
shoes, the female side of the team at least felt well-prepared for what was
to come.
At the Guildhall, the enormous ballroom meant that seventeen couples
could all dance at once—though the sprung floor did take some getting
used to!
O n c e again, our ballroom couples did well: Melanie and Simon were
placed fifth in the waltz; Vicky and Allan (Logan) were placed sixth in the
quickstep; Rebecca and Alan (Edwards) in the team for the first time,
showed a certain promise by getting into the second round in the jive, as
did Sally and Richard who were unlucky not to get further with their cha-
cha routine.
IC also entered a couple for the 'Open' competition which this year
was the samba. Marion and Daoud performed admirably—especially
since Daoud had not done any dancing until he came to IC last
September.
After the finals, the 'Off Beat' team event was held. This competition is
open to all club members, and consists of a three-minute 'sketch', the
prize being awarded for the most original and entertaining entry. Colin
Lewis, our choreographer, had produced .a very novel and funny piece
called 'The Eurovision Dance Competition' performed to T o m Lehrer's
The Vatican Rag (Italy) and The Masochism Tango (Spain). This entry
was placed fifth.
A s with the Southern Competition there was plenty of general dancing
for the s p e c t a t o r s to s t r e t c h their legs a n d a L a t i n A m e r i c a n
demonstration by the Fletchers.
A small aside for those in the know
Contrary to popular rumour, this year our infamous 'Miss Quickstep' did
not injure herself mountain climbing a few weeks before the Southern
Competition (like last year)—rather she splint herself open sliding down a
mountain on N e w Year's Day (much more considerate; after all it gave
her a whole month for the bits to weld together again).
