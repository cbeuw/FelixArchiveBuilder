A skier going down hill
To many people, skiing may seem
to be a completely pointless sport.
Why should anyone want to spend
several hundred pounds to
exchange the cosiness of home at
Christmas for a 'holiday' doing
vigorous exercise in freezing
temperatures at the top of a
mountain with the apparent
inevitability of a broken leg?
However, if this is your opinion
of skiing holidays then your ideas
are sadly outdated; thousands of
first-time skiers each year can't be
wrong. Modern advances in textiles
now enable skiers to keep warm in
even the most extreme conditions,
and any decent ski resort will by far
surpass the cosiest of homes with
the infamous apres-ski. Advances in
ski equipment have dramatically
reduced injuries to the point where
a broken leg is now extremely rare.
In fact, the most common skiing
injury is a broken thumb, and how
many skiers have you heard about
with that problem? And as far as
exercise? Why not! The air is about
as unpolluted as you can get and
skiing is an excellent way of working
off the Christmas and other festive
indulgence.
By far the most popular resorts for '
the British are in the French, Italian,
Swiss and Austrian Alps. Of these i
areas, France generally is the
cheapest with more modern
purpose-built resorts such as [
Meribel, Val dTsere and Les Arcs.
Italy is slightly more expensive and
Switzerland and Austria are the
most expensive, especially in the so-
called exclusive resorts such as
Verbier, Klosters and Gstaad where
good apres-ski compensates for the
limited skiing. There is also some
cheap skiing in Scotland but the
weather and snow are unreliable,
and the falling dollar has made
skiing in America slightly more
affordable, although still out of the
range of most students.
So what should you expect on a
ski holiday? Unfortunately
transporting thousands of people
rapidly to such an isolated place is
not easy, so, at best, you should
expect a two hour coach journey
after a flight, or else a twenty hour
coach journey to the resort.
However, the coach journey is not
as horrific as it sounds as the
coaches all have air-conditioning,
videos, refreshments, toilets and
either reclining seats or seats which
convert into bunks. On arrival you
will be issued with boots and skis
if you have not brought your own.
It is very important to ensure that
your boots fit correctly as the wrong
boots can be murder on your feet
and will not help your skiing either.
Finally you have everything
organised and it is time to hit the
slopes!
Your instructor may be either
from the holiday company or from
the local ski school (in which case
he will speak good English) but
whoever they work for, their job
depends on getting a good report
from you so they will be very patient
with you, no matter how often you
fall or need a rest.
For the beginner, the first few
days on the slopes may be
dominated by the frustrating
paradox of how easy it is to fall over
compared with getting back up
again. However, a few sessions on
a dry slope before the holiday will
hopefully by-pass this stage and you
will proceed straight to the
exhilaration of speeding along,
quietly humming the theme to 'Ski
Sunday' to yourself, before the
inevitable happens and you bury
yourself in a snow drift. The
progress of beginners varies
according to their self-confidence to
some extent, but even the slowest
of learners is able to ski down the
nursery slope with ease within a
week. The faster learners may even
have the confidence to tackle the
hardest grade of slope, the black
runs.
The process of skiing is
surprisingly tiring, partially due to
the altitude, but the slopes are well
scattered with mountain bars and
restaurants so a liquid 'confidence
booster' is never far away.
After a hard day's skiing, there is
nothing better than to get back to
the apartment, remove the weights
clamped to your feet, and flake out
in a hot bath with a generous
measure of-your duty-free. Sadly
though this euphoria cannot last
since there is still the apres ski to
come. Depending on the group you
are with you could go to the local
restaurant, pub, bowling alley,
bingo hall, night club, skating rink
or just descend on someone else's
apartment and drink their duty free.
Sleep tends to be instantaneous as
your head touches the pillow and
you wake up raring to go for
another day.
For the more advanced skiers,
skiing is not limited to bombing
down the pistes or trying to cut up
the beginners groups. For a small
hire charge you can hire a monoski
or a surf-ski for the day, both of
which are surprisingly easy to learn
to drive but difficult to master. Ski
ballet, or freestyle, is rapidly
becoming a popular sport although,
like ski jumping, there are few
places where it can be learned. The
more adventurous skiers can ski
where no man has skied before by
touring from resort to resort, or by
heli-skiing (using a helicopter to
reach the most isolated slopes).
However, I will admit that there
is one problem with skiing: the cost.
For example, for a week's holiday
in France, in the top resort of Val
Thorens, the prices range from £140
to £300 for travel and self-catering
accommodation only. To add to
this, the lift pass and insurance is
another £100 to make the basic price
for an experienced skier with his or
her own equipment at least £240.
However, for the beginner the price
rises if you include lessons and
equipment hire (at least £100) and
the necessary clothing (another
£100, although jackets and gloves
are useful in the British winter and
clothes can sometimes be
borrowed).
But before you give up hope of
ever going skiing, there is some
good news. The IC Ski Club is going
to Val Thorens this Christmas for
only £177! This price includes the lift
pass and insurance as well as travel
and accommodation, and if you
require ski and boot hire and lessons
they are only £34 and £43
respectively. This price is so low
because we have negotiated a
special group rate with a reputable
and efficient company (it is the
company which owns Les Arcs),
and not because the company has
cut corners with the holiday. If you
would like to try skiing for the first
time, or if you have already
experienced the excitement of skiing
and would like a cheap holiday,
please come and talk to the Ski
Club. We meet on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 12.45pm in Southside
Lounge, but please hurry if you
would like to come on the holiday
Another skier
since all money must be paid by
Thursday November 17 (this
deadline has been extended due to
the late publication of this article).
But whether you go this year, or
next year, give skiing a try. It really
is a fantastic sport—thousands of
first time skiers each year can't be
wrong!
