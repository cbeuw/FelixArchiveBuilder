McKinsey is the world's pre-eminent management consulting firm,
advising major companies on their strategies, mergers and acquisi-
tions, operations and organization. The Firm has 39 offices world-
wide and is owned entirely by its partners.
We are looking for a few exceptional graduates and postgraduates to
join our London Office as analysts next September, working in teams
to solve client problems. We expect them to be with us for two years
before going on to study for an M.B.A. at a leading business school.
We encourage our analysts to rejoin us as consultants and provide
them with full financial support while at business school.
We seek people with excellent academic records, in any discipline.
They must also be able to demonstrate leadership ability and wide
ranging interests.
To find out more about the Firm and our work, pick up a brochure from
your Careers Office, or come to our presentation at Imperial College
on Thursday, November 17 in the Pippard Lecture Theatre at 5.30 p.m.
We shall be holding interviews during January. If you would like to
be interviewed, please send a Standard Application Form, photo-
