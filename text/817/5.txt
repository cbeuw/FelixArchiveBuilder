Loans by 1990
Speaking in Parliament on
Wednesday, Kenneth Baker
announced that the Government
has plans to introduce student loans
in October 1990.
His proposals, published in a
white paper entitled 'Top-up Loans
for Students', state that loans will
be introduced to supplement the
grant which will be frozen at the
1990 level. Grants will remain
means-tested as at present.
Under the scheme students will
no longer be entitled to claim
housing or unemployment benefits.
The loans will be interest free but
repayment will be linked to inflation
and initially cost an additional
£120m. Students graduating on low
salaries can have the loan
repayment deferred .
The proposal allows a student
living in London to borrow £460 per
year, and £340 in their final year .
The scheme is designed to
eventually save £ 2 0 0 m per year,
which would be used to make more
places available and according to
Kenneth Baker 'reduce the burden
on parents and taxpayers'. He
added that he believed it would
make students more self-reliant and
financially independent and would
be 'a step away from the
dependency culture'.
Jack Straw, the labour Shadow
Education Secretary, retorted, 'In
the future knowledge will be

mortgaged' and added that it would
reduce access and increase debt.
The white paper has been the
subject of much press speculation
recently, and was reported in FELIX
two weeks ago when Kenneth Baker
visited College.
The Government intends to
establish three £5 million Access
Funds to provide discretionary
bursaries. The funds will be
administered by the Universities,
Polytechnics and colleges of further
education to enable students, to
continue their studies in the face of
'real financial difficulties'. The
bursaries will be available to both
undergraduate and postgraduate
students in addition to the loans.
How it will affect the IC student
The report bases the requirements
for a student's finance on the figures
shown here.
The rent paid by students living
in private accommodation at £40 per
week, over a 39 week period, is
£1560. Currently the difference
between this figure and the rent
allocation is made up by Housing
Benefit, about £400 per year. In
August 1990 this will cease to
become available and poses a grave
threat to study in London.
Rentals in London have doubled
in three years so will very rapidly
increase beyond the capacity of the
loan. If rentals average only £45 per
week in 1990 students will find they
have a £600 deficit for each year at
college despite the top-up loan.

Answering
the critics
Criticism of the loan system has
been in the form of five main points
which Mr Baker's white paper
attempts to answer.
The Government believes the debt
burden will not discourage
educational participation by
disadvantaged groups, women and
mature students. It claims this is an
'unproved cultural assumption' and
that the lower social classes are
increasingly dependent on credit.
Career prospects and the
necessity to earn higher graduate
salaries has been a contention of the
loans issue. The opposition claims
these factors will guide students'
subject choice. The white paper
argues that students should be free
to choose, whilst 'preference needs
to be informed by a better
understanding of the employment
market'. This is 'in the interest of
the student and the economy' it
adds.
Mr Baker believes academic
excellence will not be undermined
by students taking part-time work.
He argues that the academic
performance of students is already
controlled by their standard of
living.
The inflationary pressure of
forcing graduate salaries higher, is
dismissed in the report as being
relatively small.
The issue of default on repayment
of loans is addressed in the paper.
In the USA, where a much more
advanced system is present, loan
defaults cost $1.6 billion a year. The
system in Britain would allow low
income graduates to defer
repayment. Graduates who left the
country to avoid repaying top-up
loans would be prosecuted on their
return.
'loans of money', said Ken
Baker on his recent IC visit.
