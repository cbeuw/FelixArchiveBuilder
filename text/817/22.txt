Rattle and

Cert 15, Empire Leicester Square.
The 1

2 media train comes chugging
into town again. After the release of
The Joshua Tree album last year came
a mammoth world tour, followed by
the release of Rattle and Hum the
album, Rattle and Hum the book, and
now comes Rattle and Hum the
movie.
Is U2 being rammed down our
throats? Are we getting a little sick
of Lf2? For me, this film just cements
I72's standing as the world's
foremost rock group.
What is this movie about? 'It's a
musical journey', exclaims Larry
Mullen Jr, somewhat unsure of
himself. But that is all it really is, and
it doesn't pretend to be anything
else. It is a well made concert film
with brief moments of life on the
•road with the band, with concert
footage interspersed amongst the
songs. With concert footage taken
during the group's Joshua Tree tour
of the US last year, the movie was
created to give Lf2 fans the best seat
in the house from which to
experience a 1

2 concert. And it is
quite a treat for any fan. With songs
mostly from The Joshua Tree and The
Unforgettable Fire, the music is loud,
powerful and passionate-
traditional ingredients to the
group's appeal.
An annoying aspect of the film is
that it is mostly shot in black and
white, but this does give it an
informal, documentary style
presentation, making the band seem
more accessible.
We aren't given the opportunity*
to explore the minds of the
individuals making up the group, or
delve into their personalities. But,

the few snippets we are treated to
are significant ones, and there are
some gems that stand out. We see
the band in awe of a Harlem gospel
choir giving a rowsing rendition of

For; we see the great old man of
blues guitar—BB King—playing with

playing chords'. We see an
emotional Larry Mullen at
Gracelands and his obvious disgust
at seeing his hero Elvis' grave 'in his
back yard'. The band go to the
historic Sun Studios at Memphis
where they record five songs in five
hours—the songs, they say, that
kept them going, on the long tour.
However, there is nothing here
indicating the band as anything out
of the ordinary. Indeed, for the most
part the band come across as the
In L.A., it is now reaching the point
where it will be required for tourists
to know which colours to wear in
which area, in order to avoid death.
Dennis Hopper's film attempts to
analyse a problem which is daily
spiralling into more mindless
average, pretty dim, lads next door
that are suddenly propelled to
superstardom; which is a little
irritating to those of us who know
them to be a cut above the rest of
the pop crowd. However, the
turning point comes late in the film
in blazing colour, and the effect is
stunning. It is when politics rears its
head that the real 1

attacks on South Africa, the wars in

violence and more deaths, and also
assesses the police's impossible task
of trying to tackle it.
The film begins promisingly as
Hopper draws us into a world of
gangland violence and, through the
lives of two new partners; one
experienced and diplomatic (Robert
Duvall), who believes in the softly,
softly approach, and the other (Sean
Penn) who is young, vigorous and
firmly believes in the strong arm of
the law.
However, the film soon
degenerates into just another buddy
movie as it concentrates too much
on the partnership and discards the
potential of the title subject.
Although Duvall is as reliable as
ever and Penn reminds us that he
used to be a very competent actor
before becoming a full-time press
basher, they can't really do much
more with a script that fails to get
to the heart of the subject. The
direction too, lacks inspiration and
is often unoriginal, which is
surprising and disappointing
coming from a director like Hopper.
However, having said this, the
film does have its scenes, more
notably towards the end and
Hopper's nihilistic view that the
police can't win no matter what they
do, survives to make a strong point.

bombing, Bono's anger at the 'glory
of the revolution' followed by
Sunday, Bloody Sunday is a pivotal
moment of the film.
With All I Want is You rolling over
the credits, ends a film that should
be a satisfying experience for all 1

I, for one, am eagerly awaiting
their next venture. Hopefully,
though, we'll be spared The Making
of Rattle and Hum.

"A
The Greatest
Story Never Told
Tony Husband, Corgi, £2.99.
Walk into any bookshop and browse
through the humour shelves and
you'll discover a plethora of flimsy
books crammed with cartoons of
one decription or another. They are
often themed, or try to be, and
despite an incredible amount of
work by the cartoonist, are almost
always overpriced.
Here's another one. Readers of;
Punch or Private Eye would recognise
Tony Husband's style if not his
name. He has won awards as
Cartoonist of The Year three times,
and I must say that basically it's
because he is funny. I found this
latest collection hilarious in places.
I also found it confusing, since it's
subject is the Bible, and I don't
confess to knowing the Good Book
too well. Some of the jokes were lost
on me. But the many that weren't
were pretty good, funny and
slightly cruel.
Being a pretty devout athiest I was
wary of recommending this though.
So I asked a few people, Christian
and otherwise to look it over and tell
me if it's offensive. The consensus
was that it is not if you don't take
it seriously, and anyone who has a
sense of humour isn't very likely to.
So, The Greatest Story Never Told is
all set for anonymity in the endless
ranks of overpriced Christmas
stocking fillers. Just be careful who
you give it to.
