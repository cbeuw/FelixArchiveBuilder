Rents to increase
The Student Residence Committee
(SRC) has set rent levels for next
year, with an average increase of
10%. The new rents will leave the
College's Residence account in debt
by £400,000 by 1991, according to
Senior Assistant Finance Officer,
Malcolm Aldridge.
The rents were set under fierce
debate after IC Union President,
Nigel Baker expressed fears that
students would be driven away
from Imperial by rising
accommodation costs. Speaking
after the meeting Mr Baker said the
new rents 'will never work.'
Mr Aldridge told FELIX that he
was 'concerned' over the matter and
added that 'If there really are a large
number of students who cannot
afford to come to Imperial then we
are failing in our central function.'
He went on to say that he felt that
students would continue to come to
IC for the high academic standards
and social life within London.
The increases come in the wake of

a £75,000 refurbishment of Warden
and Sub-Warden accommodation,
which Mr Baker says 'really stinks.'
The SRC found that the expenditure
was a 'one-off. Managing Surveyor
of Residences, Peter Hallworth said
that a decision had been made that
'Wardens' accommodation should
be standardised.' He added that
there are no further plans for
refurbishing Warden or Sub-warden
flats.
College Secretary's
solutions to rents?
College Secretary, John Smith is to
take a paper on possible solutions
to the accommodation problem at IC
to the College's Finance and
Executive Committee meeting next
Friday. The paper proposes the
possible sale of one of the College's
Halls, the transfer of funds from
academic accounts to the residence
account and the charging of a
'notional rent' for Wardens.
In the paper, Mr Smith points out
students' financial difficulties and
the high cost of accommodation at
Imperial. On the subject of a transfer
of funds from academic
departments, Mr Smith argues that
money paid in fees to the College
above the minimum amount per
student could be transferred into the
residence account. He also suggests
that some part of the money
brought in by foreign students could
be taken from their departments to
help in the funding of residences.
This proposal is similar to the one
put forward by the last Union
General Meeting.
In the document Mr Smith
acknowledges the concern
displayed by Imperial College Union
in its motion on rent levels. He
expresses concern, however, that
the idea of using money from
overseas students' fees may meet
with opposition under the Race
Relations Act, and adds that
overseas students are no longer
guaranteed places in hall. How can
IC justify a surcharge on such
students for residences they may
not use, he queries?
The suggestion of selling a Hall is
not a new one. The Student
Residence Committee has been
considering the sale of Montpelier
Hall, in Knightsbridge for some
time. The postgraduate hall is
estimated to be worth £ 4 million.
The subject of its proposed
refurbishment is still under
discussion. Mr Malcolm Aldridge,
College Senior Assistant Finance
Officer told FELIX that no firm
decision has been made on the
£230,000 refurbishment since there
are fears that the money will have
been wasted in the event of a sale.
Maths
room
The IC Physics Department is
suffering from timetabling problems
after a doubling in intake levels in
•the Mathematics Department. First
year Maths lectures are being held
in the Huxley Building, Room 213,
a lecture hall previously used by the
Physics Department. When asked
about problems caused by this
change, Dr Gareth Jones, Head of
Undergraduate Studies for Physics,
said that the resulting Physics
timetable was 'inflexible' and that it
was a 'disadvantage'. Speaking on
the subject of room 213 in Huxley,
Dr Berkshire of the Maths
Department said, 'it's ours and we
will use it as we see fit'.
Since leaving members of staff
have not been replaced under
present College policy, staffing
levels in the Maths Department
have dropped from 60 to 50 in the
past year. Many tutors have been
surprised to find they have 2 or 3
personal tutees instead of the
previous 1 or 2. Commenting on the
low staffing levels, Dr Berkshire said
'Well, they'll just have to work
harder then, won't they?'. He also
added that 'it would have been nicer
if there'd been more' in this year's
Maths intake.
BEST!
Two Chemical Engineering students
represented Imperial College at a
conference of European science
students in Eindhoven, Holland last
week.
The conference was held by the
Board of European Students in
Science and Technology (BEST) at
the Technische Universiteit of
Eindhoven. BEST was inaugurated
at a similar conference in Grenoble
in March of this year and plans to
hold events in 1989 in Vienna and
Berlin.
Students attended from the EEC,
Scandinavia and the Eastern Block
countries of Poland and Hungary.
The purpose was to expose differing
cultures and develop
communication across national
boundaries. Anyone interested in
attending the 1989 event should
contact Amy Blake and Michael
Farry.
Southside
till theft?
Fifty pounds 'went missing' from
the main till in Southside Bar on
Saturday. All staff working on
Saturday are being interviewed by
College Security. They believe the
money is unlikely to have been lost
in the system, and was possibly
stolen by a member of staff.
The College has a policy of
contacting the police over incidents
of theft. The results of the
investigation are likely to be made
public after interviews have taken
place.
And finally
Despite caring attention from
Wendy Morris, his adopted father,
Norman the Union rat sadly passed
away last weekend.
Norman had been with the
College for two months following
eviction from his previous residence
in Fulham. He soon became known
as a chirpy, friendly soul around the
office, who was always ready to
stink the place out and get rid of any
curried rice that one might have left.
Norman will be sorely missed by
those who knew him as a friend and
saviour.
Amen.
