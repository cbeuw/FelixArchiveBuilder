Careers
Engineering in perspective
Gone are the days of being able to get up when you like and go to lectures
if you want to. From now on it's five or maybe six days a week, every
week for the next forty odd years! This rather bleak view of full-time
employment is not intended to scare you, but it is often the image held
by students, as I did, about working life. I now hope to dispel some of
these fears and enlighten you to some of the better points of life as an
engineer and more generally as a professional person.
I graduated from Brunei
University as a Mechanical Engineer
in July 1988 and since then I have
been employed by ICI Chemicals &
Polymers Group in Teeside. In fact,
I have been employed by ICI since
the age of 17 when I was successful
in obtaining sponsorship for my thin
sandwich course at Brunei. Having
only ever worked for one company
might have given me a blinkered
view of engineering, but because of
the size and diversity of this
particular company, I would like to
think this is not the case.
Whilst at Brunei I spent a total of
eighteen months on industrial
placements; two of the six month
periods were spent on Teeside, the
other with ICU Brantham in Essex.
Since joining full-time in July 1988
I have spent three months with ICI
Americas in Wilmington, Delaware,
USA and I am now four weeks into
my job as Mechanical Technical
Support Engineer for one of the
Terephthalic Acid plants on the
Wilton site, Teeside. Having done
a thin sandwich course, I was
perhaps in a better position as a
graduate recruit than some of those
who had come straight from full-
time courses. The transition from
student life to full-time employment
I found it very
difficult, from an
interview, to discover
what was on offer.
is probably one of the most radical
changes in environment and
attitude that anyone is likely to
make. As a result of spending time
in industry between periods of
academic work, the two very
different approaches to engineering
were blended together well.
A sound and comprehensive
academic training is essential in all
professional jobs but the ways that
you apply this knowledge can vary
considerably. It is this practical
approach to engineering that is
sadly lacking from all University and
College courses and it is the first
lesson you will have to learn as a
graduate recruit.
The message which overrides all
others throughout the majority of
companies in the UK, is 'Safety
Comes First'. At University only a
passing word is mentioned with
regard to safety but now everything
I do revolves, and rightly so, around
that one word. The other big
Life as an engineer is
not all roses.
difference between University and
Industry is responsibility, at
University it did not really matter if
you got one of your calculations
wrong or your balsawood bridge
failed because of poor design or you
used the wrong glue. In industry,
however, poor or careless design
can result in major incidents such as
the Hixborough disaster. Right from
day one you are told: 'You will be
held responsible for your actions'.
This all sounds very dramatic, but
it really is not as bad as it sounds.
You are not just thrown in at the
deep end and left to get on with it.
There are strict instructions and
procedures to follow and a veritable
.plethora of 'experts' to help you
make the necessary decisions. I am
• still in the process of an extensive
induction course which has been
designed to introduce me to
everybody I need to know in order
to do my job effectively. When this
induction is over though my
training is far from complete. My
career path is carefully monitored by
a career working party to ensure I
get the most from the company and
that the company gets the most out
of me. I will receive continuous on
the job training as well as attending
specific courses to prepare me for
the next, more challenging
placement.
As Technical Engineer for a
continuous plant, which runs 24
hours a day, 7 days a week making
Terephthalic Acid, I respond
directly to the Maintenance
Manager, whose job it is to keep the
plant running. I suppose the
broadest remit for my job is to
improve the long-term reliability
and performance of the plant from
an engineering stand point. The
work, despite the man-traps of
safety and procedure, is extremely
varied, always interesting and often
challenging. As well as providing
the technical input to a problem
there is also an element of man-
management involved in the
implementation of the work. Man-
management is another personal
skill, which is not taught (if it can
be taught) at University or College,
which is vital in industry if work is
to be done properly, efficiently and
safely.
There is nothing wrong with the
large cities such as Leeds and
Newcastle. I was brought up on the
South Coast and have spent the last
four years in London. Moving to
Teeside in the North East of
England has come as something of
a culture shock but you soon adapt
to it. Again though, my sponsored
industrial placements in Teeside
have prepared me for this
permanent move. Permanent is
perhaps the wrong word because,
as with many international
companies, ICI may move me to one
of the hundred odd sites in the UK
or perhaps (hopefully!) to sites
farther afield.
There is one element of full-time
employment which I have not yet
mentioned which, to some, is
probably the most important of all;
the money! Suddenly I have gone
from being a poor student with four-
figure overdraft to an engineer
earning over £1000 a month. The
overdraft has not diminished any
but my standard of living has
improved considerably and my
social life has become hectic to the
point of exhaustion.
Life as an engineer is not all roses
though. A large chemical site on the
edge of the North Sea can be a grim
place to work when it is minus ten
degrees with force five winds and
dark by four o'clock. The majority
of engineers I know put a lot more
than 37V2 hours a week and are
often here in the middle of the night
or over the weekend.
In conclusion, I would say that if
you have been put off engineering
by the work you are doing at
University, try the real thing before
you become a Merchant Banker in
the City.
