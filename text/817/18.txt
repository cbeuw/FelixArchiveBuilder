COMPETITION
Are you unsure of your career
plans? Does the thought of a nine
to five accountancy job terrify you?
How does this sound for a career:
Lots of foreign travel, short hours,
international fame and enough dosh
to give your bank manager early
retirement. Interested? Well that's
the sort of benefits available to a top
Formula One driver and
unfortunately it takes an awful lot
of hard work and sacrifice to get to
that level. However, they all started
somewhere, most of Jhem
(including World Champion Ayrton
Senna) in Formula Ford.
This week's competition gives you
the chance to drive a Lola T644E
Formula Ford 1600 racing car at the
Goodwood motor racing circuit on
Sunday November 20. On that day
Guilds Motor Club have hired the
circuit for people to dirve their cars
(or their parents or friends cars)
around under the expert guidance
of experienced members. Anyone
interested should get in touch with
them via the Guilds Office (Mech
Eng, level 3 or internal 3521).
The prize will be awarded to two
people, one male, one female and
entrants must possess a full driving
licence.
THE QUESTIONS:
1. Who is the new World Champion
driver?
2. How long is the Goodwood circuit?
3. When was Formula Ford
introduced to Britain?
4. Who won this year's RAC FF1600
championship?
5. Which manufacturer icon Le Mans
this year?
TIE BREAKER:
Complete the following in no more
than 12 words:
