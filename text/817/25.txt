Off air
As you may have noticed, STOIC
have been off the air for the last
week. We're sorry, but our technical
team have been giving the studio a
complete refit. Hopefully, they will
have finished by today, and 'Into
the Night' should be starting at 7pm
as usual.

The Fast Trouser Show has had
exclusive details on how to deal with
the trauma if you have suddenly
found out that you are Welsh. So
read on.. .And also for all those who
have discovered that getting the clap
is not something to boast to your
mother about.
Every Thursday at 1pm, you can
hear the Fast Trouser Show on IC
Radio, so get to somewhere where
you can hear the damn thing. If you
are in Southside there is no excuse.
If you are a vegetarian, OK no one's
perfect, but do five cucumbers get
as much satisfaction as you do in
being slowly inserted into the
human torso?
IC Radio, Thursday, 1pm.
PS. For all you Welsh students,
consult your local vet for a course
in anal surgery!

News
Every Sunday between 10am to
Noon on IC Radio is Gabby's
Sunday Supplement. So all of you
who aren't trying to get a quick one
over, might as well tune in for a
light-hearted look into the week's
events.

Radio Days
How does one write an article about
a film one knows nothing about?
Mind you, it's by Woody Allen so
what more do I need to know, it's
bound to be good isn't it? I think it's
a series of stories about Woody's
childhood listening to the radio but
I could be wrong. Come along and
watch and find out anyway. The
usual time and place, check 'What's
On' for details.
