T e a c h i n g—the
politics and pitfalls of the
classroom
There was a time when teaching
was regarded by some as a soft
option - a last resort for the graduate
if all else failed. This is no longer the
case; the profession faces greater
challenges today than at any time in
its history and graduates would be
well advised to consider carefully
the evolutionary processes which
are combining to make teaching one
of the most stressful occupations
today.
Before considering the financial
rewards, short days and long
holidays it may be advisable to think
of the high proportion of teachers
who retire early on the grounds of
ill health or mental breakdown.
What is happening in the world
of education to produce such serious
problems? One of the most
contentious issues is discipline in
the classroom. It is not simply a
question of the much publicised
violence or the abolition of corporal
punishment; laudable though it
was, it was simply the first step in
a series of legal moves which have
reduced the sanctions available to
teachers'to an alarming extent.
Discipline in today's classrooms
can only be maintained by a process
of negotiation between the teacher
and pupil, but not all parents or
pupils are prepared to enter into
that process.
The status of teachers in todays
society is constantly called into
question. Words such as
accountability and assessment are
bandied around with little or no
understanding of the problems they
create. Mr Baker, has stated that
teachers should be assessed
annually - a simple enough idea, but
by whom and on what grounds ?
The learning and teaching processes
are subjective; they cannot be
quantified or measured empirically.
There is also the problem of the
objectivity of the proposed
assessment.
The encroachment of information
technology into the classroom is
another factor which is claiming a lot
of firsts for some teachers. The
range of skills and knowledge
required to handle the new
technology expands daily and
teachers are expected to keep
abreast of these developments.
'It is without doubt a very rewarding career, if
one is successful, but it is also extremely
demanding.'
Through the advisory services local
education authorities do provide
courses to enable teachers to gain
new skills or expertese, but the
knowledge base is constantly
shifting and expanding.
The stresses involved in these
developments coupled with
additional work of the changing
syllabuses and examination
requirements have increased the
work load of the teacher to an extent
which could not be forseen 20 years
ago. As a direct consequence the
teacher finds himself operating in a
strained environment which is
foreign to the one he envisaged
when he elected to enter the
profession.
The Government's latest package
of proposals indicate the rate of
change is not going to slacken. The
advent of the City Technical
Colleges (CTC) in their areas will
create even greater pressures on the
teacher. Already schools are
beginning to compete with each
other. There is a percieved need to
be judged as being a 'good' or
'successful' school and the obvious
criteria for comparison is
examination results. If the 'better'
educated parent of pupils who
currently attend secondary schools';
with good catchment areas send
their children to the local CTC the
school's success rate in
examinations will fall off. Will the
school then be judged as a failure?
There will certainly be an increase
in the pressure brought to bear on
teachers to maintain past levels of
achievement. As we move into an
era when schools will be responsible
for their own financial
administration, and the funding is
dependent on the number of pupils
attending each school parental
choice will become a vital
consideration in the success or
otherwise of any school. The
prospects for some schools look very
bleak indeed.
In the light of these and other
developments currently under
consideration, it will behold the
graduate well to think very carefully
before commiting him or her self to
a career in teaching. It is without
doubt a very rewarding career, if
one is successful, but it is also
extremely demanding. In the old
days it was said that 'those who can
do - those who can't teach.' Perhaps
it should be rephrased 'those who
can teach and those who can't
should keep well away'.
A c t u a r y
Most people have absolutely no idea
what an actuary is or does, unless
they know one. This is not
surprising, as there are only about
2000 qualified actuaries in Britain.
Actuaries are professional people
who have taken exacting
professional examinations. They
work mostly in the field of insurance
and life assurance, where they
devise insurance policies and
pension schemes, manage and
invest the fund:, generated from
such schemes, or work as
consultants or brokers for
companies wishing to invest in
pension schemes.
To do their job, actuaries require
a sound knowledge of statistical
theory, demography (population
statistics), economics and
investment. Most actuaries have a
mathematics or economics degree,
although any degree with a strong
mathematical element may be
acceptable.
There are ten actuarial
examinations, divided into two
sections. The first six examinations
deal with the necessary theory. The
other four examinations deal with
the application of this theory to
everyday actuarial problems. Most
actuaries study via correspondence
courses (although there are some
one year MSc courses, which allow
exemption from part of the
examinations). The majority of large
insurance companies allow two half
days paid leave each week for study
purpose. It is usual for actuarial
students to complete their
examinations in four to six years,
when they will become Associates
of the Institute of Actuaries.
The Financial rewards for
actuaries are generous—higher than
those for accountants (though
probably not as high as, for
example, merchant banking). The
average graduate salary is
approximately £10,000 in London,
rising to £17,000 for newly qualified
actuaries.
Most trainee actuaries join large
insurance or life assurance
companies. They provide 'on the
job' training, to complement the
formal examinations, moving their
trainees around their different
departments. It is usual to spend six
months to a year in each section,
and this not only provides the
opportunity to apply the theory
acquired during study, but also to
'try out' different areas and choose
the area one wishes to specialise in.
