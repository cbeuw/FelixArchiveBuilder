It is with regret that I have to report
the resignation of one of our
Officers, Amin iS-Kholy, the
Overseas Students Committee
Chairman, owing to work
pressures. Elections will have been
held for the posts of Chairman,
Publicity Officer and Liason Officer
on Wednesday 9th November.
Sports Shop Sale
We sold over £11,000 worth of stock
in the sale, leaving the Sportshop
account looking a bit healthier!
There is still a lot of stock left over,
so we will probably hold another
sale towards the end of term. My
thanks to everyone who helped
make the sale such a success - both
staff and customers.
Snack Bar
There has been a fairly positive
reponse to the food being served in
the Snack Bar, but nevertheless it
appears that many students aren't
satisfied. I would like to point out
that merely critisizing the food or
the surroundings is pointless unless
you can come up with some
alternatives. So if you have a
complaint or suggestion, send it in
writing to either myself or David
Peacock, Union Manager. Please
include your name and department
so that we can keep you informed.
It is, after all, YOUR Snack Bar.
IC Women
I am writing (somewhat belatedly)
to introduce myself as IC Women's
Officer. My job is to represent all
women students and ensure that
they are not discriminated against.
If there is anything you wish to
discuss with me I can be reached,
via the Union or the Mech Eng
pigeonholes.
For a start, I'd like to draw your
attention to the following.
Rape Alarms. These are available
to all women students free of
charge. See Kathy in the Union
Office.
Self Defence. If anyone is
interested in a short self-defence
course (run by the police) please
give your names to Kathy. Also, on
Tues November 15 and Thursday
November 17, there are two videos
on personal safety for women being
shown in the Pippard Lecture
Theatre, Sherfield (1pm on Tuesday
and 12.30pm on Thursday). See
posters around College.
College Women's Tutor. This is
Sandra Dawson of the Management
School (53 Princes Gate—opposite
Mech Eng). She is extremely
approachable, so if you are having
problems of any sort, don't hesitate
to contact her (via me if you prefer).
ULU Health Week. There are a
number of lectures specifically for
women, for example breast
examination and post-abortion
councelling on Wednesday 16 and
Thursday 17 November at ULU. See
