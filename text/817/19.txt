The
Arms
Race
Now is the time when most final
year students are beginning to
think seriously about finding a job.
The Careers Fair is one way in
which companies try to attract the
attention of future graduates, and
it is only part of a process of
presentations designed to smooth
the transition from student to
employee. But amidst all the
brochures and the hype, there are
one or two awkward questions that
many companies would prefer not
to be asked. For the science,
technology and engineering
graduates of IC, one of the most
important questions is 'how is your
company involoved in the arms
trade?'
The arms business has not led to
a secure peace, as some hard facts
can show. Since 1945, 21 million
people have died in wars, mainly in
the Third World. Three out of every
five deaths were civilians, the
majority of them women, children
and the elderly. Two-fifths of the
Nicamguian Soviet-built HIND helicopter
world scientific R&D is devoted to
military purposes, and $17 billion is
spent on arms every two weeks (this
amount is enough to feed, clothe
and house everyone in the world for
a year). The science graduate is an
integral part of this process and
three out of every five in this
country go on to take a job in arms
related industry. Britain is one of the
world's leading arms exporters and
sold Â£5,000 million of military
equipment to overseas countries in
1986.
Three-quarters of these UK arms
exports were to Third World
countries. When people in this
country think about the arms trade,
it is more often in terms of balance
of payments than about where the
arms go or the uses to which they
are put. Already nearly every Third
World country spends more on its
military than on health and
education, and many of these
countries have serious debts which
are made worse by the spending on
armaments. A recent report in a
At an opening debate of the UN
General Assembly in 1987, a
number of Third World delegates
warned that the debt problems of
developing nations were as serious
a threat to international stability as
the arms race. "A world in which
politics is replaced by arsenals and
economy by finance is simply a
world in danger," stated President
Alfonsin of Argentina. However, a
world in even greater danger is one
in which the build up of arms is
actually intermeshed with the debt
crisis.
Third World governments have
spent a large proportion of loans on
purchasing expensive weapons
systems, greatly encouraged by the
world's arms companies who faced
a slump in sales at the end of the
Vietnam war. Between 1972 and
1982, precisely the period of
increased Third World borrowing
which has led to the current global
financial crisis, the value of arms
delivered to non-oil producing
developing countries more than
doubled in real terms. Since arms
can only be used for destruction,
they generate no further income and
have done nothing to repay debts.
Indeed, arms purchases have led to
further borrowing.

Turning to the International
Monetary Fund for short term loans,
Third World governments find that
loan conditions include a removal of
government food subsidies, cuts in
health and education, and
reductions in wages - all measures
that extract money from the poorest
sectors of society. A reduction in
military spending is never included
in these conditions.
Such austerity measures, by
diverting resources into the
international loans; policies
for increasing exports
less food production for local
consumption and
impoverishment of the society
purchase of costly military
equipment, deny people of the most
fundamental human rights - the
right to work, to be free from
hunger and to enjoy good health
and education. When the denial of
these human rights provokes the
people into protest, their
governments often find it necessary
to retaliate with violence, involving
harsher repression, more military
spending and greater poverty for
the people. A vicious circle is set up
which is extremely difficult to break.
British medical journal on the health
of the Third World showed a direct
correlation between high arms
spending and high infant mortality.
More directly, this global trade
occurs in a world where two-thirds
of the people are undernourished
and millions are dying from hunger
and preventable diseases. The arms
trade diverts money away from
these issues. So without ever being
used, merely by existing, the ever
expanding armouries of the
underdeveloped nations are killing
and maiming on a massive scale.
Looking more closely at the
consequences of the arms trade
within such countries reveals a
vicious dynamic called the poverty-
repression-militarisation cycle. The
debt, which is increased by the
spending on arms and luxuries by
Third World elites, leads them to
generate more hard currency by
cutting wages, food subsidies and
welfare programmes and by
increasing exports (eg. cash crops).
The poor, as ever, bear the brunt of
these measures but any expression
of discontent or protest is repressed
by the government, which then
buys more arms to maintain its
military stranglehold on power.
The arms trade is also an overtly
Green issue. From the total
destruction of full scale war through
Vietnam style defoliation to the
deliberate disruption of
environmental programmes by the
Contras in Nicaragua, the business
of military sales helps to wreck our
planet. The militarisation of the
world is the very opposite of a
sustainable lifestyle.
Today, Britain is one of the
leading arms manufacturers and
traders. What about all the jobs that
must depend on the arms industry?
Surely making arms for export
makes economic sense? In fact,
