With America back in the space
race, Russia about to launch 'her'
space shuttle, and pollution a highly
topical subject at the moment, most
people are unaware of the
enormous amount of 'space
pollution' orbiting the Earth.
The North American Air System
(NORAD) currently have 6194
trackable objects, tennis-ball size or
above, on their computer system,
and of these only about 300 are
operating satellites! In addition to
this, they estimate that there are
another 40,000 golf-ball sized objects
that are not trackable. The debris
' ranges from paint flecks, nuts and
bolts and fragments of exploded
satellites to hand tools that have
slipped from the gloves of
astronauts!
The majority of space debris
comes from the explosion of space
rocket stages and satellites.
Approximately 80 explosions have
been caused by the combustion of
spent rocket casings and the
deliberate explosions for space
weapons testing.
Unplanned explosions of rocket
stages have occurred years after the
launch; some fifteen Soviet Proton
and US Delta and Titan rocket
shrouds are known to have burst
spontaneously in orbit. The thin
casing that separates fuels corrodes
in the harsh environment, the fuels
mix and explode. Delta shrouds lay
dormant for about three years, and
in keeping with its performance on
the ground, even Arianne has
exploded after spending a year in
orbit!
Deliberate explosions in space
have been occurring since the 1950s
when the US exploded warheads in
low orbits. Ballistic missile and
antisatellite tests are thought to have
injected 10 million pieces of debris
into low and high orbits.
On September 13, 1985, a
functioning solar research satellite,
Solwind, was destroyed by an
experimental antisatellite missile.
NORAD showed that the debris
formed a 300-mile dust cloud
containing 300 trackable pieces.
After this test, Congress prohibited
antisatellite tests against objects in
space? however, in September 1986,
two satellites were blown up as part
of a SDI test.
Even if no further refuse were
generated intentionally or by
accident, the flurry of fragments
already in orbit might spawn more
debris. NASA scientists believe that
the large velocities at which space
particles collide (about 8 to lOkm/s)
could be destructive enough to
generate hundreds or even
thousands of additional particles.
The proliferation of these particles
could snowball into a chain reaction
with other satellites or particles,
with the result being a debris belt
around the Earth. Should this debris
tear into a discarded satellite still
more debris would be generated,
increasing the potential for
destruction.
The Soviets have dumped 3000
pounds of old nuclear-powered
satellites in a 600 mile orbit, 'A
hyper velocity collision with a spent
Soviet nuclear reactor may generate
as many as one million particles of
a diameter of one millimetre or
more', says Nicholas Johnson of
Teledyine-Brown Engineering.
NASA has been particularly
worried about the space debris
1984 when Challenger astronauts
retrieved the ailing Solar-Maximum
Satellite. Detailed micro-
photographs revealed that the
aluminium casing was createred by
thousands of impacts, the largest by
miles a marble-sized object would
take a year, at 500 miles, 30 years,
and at 800 miles, a mission-
threatening 300 years!
'At 300 miles, the typical altitude
for space stations, orbiting
telescopes, and other satellites, you
are definitely in a spece-debris
environment', says Donald
Kressler, NASA Orbital Debris
specialist at Houston.
Graphic evidence of the damage
that can be done was discovered in
a particle of at least 1mm diameter.
From the density of cratering,
scientists have estimated that the
flux density of space debris is
comparable to that of natural
micrometeorites.
The Hubble Space telescope,
scheduled for launch next year, has
a projected 17-year operational
lifetime, but may not survive to
carry out its full mission. Michael
Sharva of the HST Institute in
threat since June 1983, when a
stamp-sized paint fleck cracked the
wind shield of the space shuttle,
Challenger; an impact equivalent to
a ten pin bowling ball travelling at
60 miles per hour! Other satellites
believed to have been battered by
debris include the Soviet Kosmos
1275, the European GEOS-2 and a
US balloon satellite.
Contrary to popular belief, space
is not self-cleaning, although
atmospheric drag does eventually
cause objects to re-enter the
atmosphere. At an altitute of 180
miles, debris can take from several
days to 9 months to re-enter; at 300
Maryland estimates a 1 per cent
chance of being destroyed by debris
during its lifetime. For a billion-
dollar investment, such odds are not
attractive. The Hubble Space
Telescope will be put into a low
Earth orbit, and its cross-section of
172 square feet and lack of thrusters
make it a very likely target. Sharva
has calculated that there is a 0.1%
chance of cillison with an object of
above lm; NASA will know days in
advance if debris will impact, and
being unable to manoeuvre, will be
able to do nothing about it!
Even ground based astronomy
has not escaped from the space
debris threat. The atmosphere is a
very poor optical medium; large
objects such as MIR and the Space
Shuttle are visible with the naked
eye. Others are fainter, but easily
detected by sensitive photographic
emulsions used in
astrophotography. Most space
debris in low earth orbit is only
visible for a few hours after dusk or
before dawn, but pieces of spent
rockets and broken satellites in
geostationary orbit (22,300 miles
above the Earth), pose a more
difficult problem, because the clutter
is visible for most of the time, and
has an infinitely long decay period.
Although Kressler estimates that the
problem will not become serious for
another 25 years, optical
astronomers differ in their views of
how the debris affeqfs their work.
Radio astronomy, unaffected by
the time of day, does not escape.
Reflections from debris can wipe
complete bands from the spectrum
at a time. Astronomers were given
a glimpse of this, when, in 1961, the
USAF launched the 'Needles'
project—releasing billions of copper
needles into orbit to create a dipole
belt around the Earth, to act as a
mirror. These needles were
supposed to re-enter in early 1966,
although a few clumps are still
thought to be in orbit.
What then of the future? When
will the first mission fail as a result
of a collison with space debris—or
will a clean-up operation be initiated
before such a disaster occurs?
Several 'space dustbins' have been
proposed—the trash removal and
satellite hauler 1 (TRASH 1)
proposed by SpaceTech Inc, or a
debris catcher with a huge scoop,
miles in diameter are just two
suggestions.
But as with most problems,
prevention is better than cure, and
several ideas are being investigated.
The airforce want to use more
'disposable orbits' in low Earth
orbits, which speed up re-entry
times. Satellites are more modular,
thus reducing the number of
exterior nuts and bolts and a new
NASA operational procedure
ensures that all rocket fuel is burnt
up eliminating the problem of
exploding rocket casings.
