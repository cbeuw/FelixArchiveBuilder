Student Loans. The introduction of
student loans, announced on
Wednesday, represents another nail
in the coffin in which the Robbins
principle of freely available
education has been laid to rest.
The Government has presented
the scheme as an attempt to help
students. In reality it provides the
Government with the excuse it
needs to first freeze, than phase out
student grants completely.
Any move which leads to a
reduction in the number, of highly
educated people in a country can
only be detrimental to the country's

Alternative Prospectus. The
College, with some hesitation, has
released the mailing list which will
allow the Union to send out this
year's batch of Alternative
Prospectus (AP) supplements. The
supplements are likely to cause a
few raised eyebrows amongst those
College academics who cannot
believe that the ivory towers in this
centre of excellence are anything
less than sparkling.
Whilst the AP has always proved
controversial, the reaction of some
academics when it comes to criticism
can only be described as childish.
Two years ago the Alternative
Prospectus Editor, Sunny Bains,
received open threats from one of
the lecturers within her department
because the lecturer did not approve
of her editorial comments. The
meeting left Sunny in tears and she
was told that she would have to
'accept the consequences' of her
actions. What those consequences
were was not made clear, but
whether they would have affected
her degree class, references, or any
application to take a second degree
is an open question.
This, year, departments were
unhappy with the first version of the
Alternative Prospectus Supplement
edited by Martyn Peck. They were
quite correct; the supplement was
inaccurate and later completely
rewritten.
Nevertheless the paranoia
generated by the AP is illustrated by
a letter circulated by an academic in
the Mathematics Department. The
letter accused Paul Shanley of
writting the article on Mathematics
which it described as 'clear libel'.
The academic based his
assumption on the fact that the
name 'Shan' had appeared in the
credits 'for providing endless hours
of amusement'.
But the article was written by
Martyn Peck.
whether or not the incident had
anything to do with the
department's refusal to let Mr
Shanley re-sit some of his exams
when he was entitled to do so, is a
moot point.
Given the attitude of members of
the College staff to the Alternative
Prospectus, I do not think the Union
can continue to expect individual
students to take on its entire
production. An editorial committee
seems to have a lot in its favour;
protection from victimisation and a
greater input of student views. It is
something that the Union should
seriously consider.
Apologies. The Union President
Nigel Baker is quite right to point
out two factual errors in last weeks
editorial and I would like to take the
opportunity to set the record
straight.
The questions raised in the
editorial revolved around the
election of a Chairman for the Union
General Meetings (UGM's) and the
fact that the Union Executive had
decided that a part-time student,
Paul Shanley, was not eligible for
the post.
The rules to determine the validity
of all elections are contained within
the 'Blue Book' - the 'Bible' by
which the Union operates.
The particular rules concerning
the eligibility of part-time students
to take up Union posts are not
clearly defined, and this is where
the dispute originates.
Having read Nigel's letter there
are two points I would like to
correct. Firstly, the decision
concerning the Blue Book was made
by 5 members of the IC Union
Executive not 4 as stated in the
editorial. Secondly, and this is a
major point, the Executive did not
over-rule the Blue Book, they
interpreted it.
As Nigel points out in the letters
page, to change the by-laws requires
the approval of two Union General
Meetings (UGM) and the Governing
Body of Imperial College. However
the interpretation of the Blue Book
is arguably a matter for the Union
Executive.
In this case the Blue Book
contained contradictory information
and the Executive were free to
interpret it however they wished.
I would therefore like to apologise
to Nigel and the rest of the Executive
for suggesting otherwise.
Loop Holes. Two years ago a
precedent was set which allowed
part-time students to take up posts
in the Union. The case in point was
the election of part time-student,
Sydney Harbour-Bridge (name
changed in aid of comic relief) to the
position of Union President. The
Exec of the day met and interpreted
the Blue Book to allow part-time
students to take up Union positions.
Mr Harbour Bridge was therefore
President for a year, his successor
being Nigel Baker.
The fact that this year's Exec were
WA'TC-H A! ErVTlH'.

free to overturn that precedent
illustrates the farcical state of the
book which is supposed to govern
the Union's operation. And this
reflects badly on the Union itself.
UGM's. It is impossible to have
sensible debates on U G M motions
when the motions are distributed a
few minutes before the U G M starts
and students are not given adequate
time to read them. It is even more
difficult when the motions raised
contain intricate clauses in small
print. Moreover, it is all too easy for
people to slip in clauses which have
far reaching effects in motions—
which on the surface seem
innocuous.
The Officers who submitted the
motion allowing a vote of 'no
candidate' to the last U G M ought to
have known better than to gloss
over the accompanying by-law
changes.
How many of the students
attending the last U G M knew that,
by voting in favour of a 'no
candidate' option in Union elections
they were also voting to prohibit
part-time students from standing?
This was an issue which some
students may have wished to
debate.
