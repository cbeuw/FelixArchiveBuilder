That's when we'll be with you in the Imperial University and we're looking forward to meeting you then. It's the
perfect opportunity for you to find out more about what we do - and to demonstate the kind of technical and personal
expertise that could take you a long way with one of the world's most successful technological organisations.
We operate through eleven autonomous business units, designing, developing and manufacturing a range of very high
quality products including laser-based weapon simulators, automatic test equipment, energy management systems
and instrumentation systems. Our engineers work in small project teams that enjoy a great deal of operational
independence.
Whatever your specialisation - Physics, Computer Science, Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical or Production
Engineering - your good ideas will be rewarded with an exceptional level of budgetary and technical support.
We believe in putting talented people straight into a productive role within a project team - so your training needs will
be accommodated both "on the job" and through a series of relevant courses. This role could be in R&D, Production,
Purchasing or Sales, to name but a few. In our relatively small business units, your achievements are quickly noticed
- and ambitious engineers enjoy rapid career development including movement between sites, across disciplines and
overseas.
We'll be holding an informal presentation at the Imperial University on Wednesday 30th November
at 6pm, talk to your Careers Service or contact us directly by calling Rosie Cray on (0202) 893535 for further
details. Alternatively, write to her at: Schlumberger Industries and Technologies, Ferndown Industrial Estate,
