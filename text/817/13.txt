Careers
In Summary...
General Employment Prospects
Since the low in 1981/82,
employment prospects have been
rising steadily. Although full
unemployment rates are one
obvious indicator of this (and
Imperial is always at or near
bottom of the league table), ever;
other measure tells the same story.
Thus there are more jobs on offer,
more employers asking to visit,
more employers having jobs
available at Summer Fairs and many
others. While all these signs art
particularly evident here, the same
optimistic reports are being made all
around the country. As might be
expected, demand is strongest in
such areas as electronics and
computer science. One employer,
commenting on the trend, reckoned
they would have to run hard to
stand still! In other words they were
going to find it much harder to
recruit as many graduates in 1986 as
they did in 1985. There has also
been a good recovery in recruitment
levels in manufacturing and, to a
slightly lesser extent, the oil
industry. Finance (Banking,
Accour' cy, Insurance,
Commoc, iti , and Retailing are two
other areas that need a special
m°ntion. Most of the employers
e are making special efforts to
science and engineering
g,^duates.
All this does not mean that the
1988 graduates can sit back and wait
for attractive job offers. The market
does not operate that way. As an
example; about 300 electronics
graduates were unemployed at the
start of the year. It is still vital to
remember you must be realistic—if
you have taken five years for a pass
degree do not insist on looking for
a R&D job as one graduate (from
elsewhere in London) did a few
years ago. Also good applications
are crucial but they are dealt with
elsewhere in this issue.
Taking a Year Off
...or six months (some employers
recruit in March).
A year off taken before University
is welcomed almost universally.
Quite a number think seriously
instead about having some time off
after graduation and before starting
(serious!) work. This too can be very
rewarding and productive. As
usual, however, there are some
qualifications to be made. If, for
example, you are aged about 21 or
22 then there is no problem, from
an age consideration, regarding
your eventual career prospects. If,
however, you are 24 or 25 it may be
less straightforward and it could be
worthwhile to seek careers advice
first. It is also good that at any age
you would have some sort of plan
for the year and one which you can
articulate—perhaps to a future
employer. You should be able to talk
about what your aims were, what
you gained from the experience etc.
You should also think ahead. For
example it might be fun going
jackarooing in Australia for about 12
months but you will hardly be well
placed to apply for jobs back in the
UK. For just such simple reasons as
this, 12 months off often becomes 15
or more. Remember the vacancy
lists in September are probably
shorter than at any other time of the
year. Nevertheless, given some
thought and planning, some time
off after graduation can be fun,
productive and, for many, a time of
great personal development.
Summer Fairs
It has always been wrong to think
of recruitment as being only a
January to March phenomenon
associated with the Graduate
Recruitment Programme (GRP),
otherwise known as the Milk
Round. In fact, recruitment is
increasingly becoming an all-the-
year-round event. Nevertheless,
outside the GRP, the next busy peak
is during the Summer Fairs. This is
the time in June and July, starting
immediately after finals, when there
are about ten fairs throughout the
country. Of these, London's is by
far the biggest. This year almost 200
employers attended during its three
days, with a wide variety of jobs on
ioffer. Thus these events are
I particularly useful for those who
have not wanted to think about jobs
iprior to graduation.
