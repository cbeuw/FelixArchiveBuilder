Careers
Thoughts on finding a caree
What do you think is important? Have you decided yet? Do you care?
If you think the third statement applies to you, then I'm not sure what
you are doin£ at Imperial College in the first place!
My qualifications for writing this do not include becoming the chairman
of the company I work for—yet!...However, three years after leaving
University I'm happy that I've made the right decisions so far. My work
has been interesting and enjoyable and my salary quite acceptable!
Throughout my time at University
my ideas on careers were constantly
evolving and I hope they will
continue to evolve for a few years
yet! So far they seem to have
worked out well for me and
therefore I'll try and explain a few
factors that I believe are important.
First of all, it helps to have the
confidence that you'll be able to do
and obtain the job that you want; in
It is difficult to
persuade someone
else you can do a job
when you're not sure
yourself.
that order—there's no point in
seriously applying for a job unless
you reckon you've got a chance at
persuading the employer that you
are capable of that job and it's
difficult to persuade someone else
that you can do a job when you're
not sure yourself. I'm not talking
about 'bullshitting' (it tends to get
spotted!), but straight confidence in
your own abilities. On the other
hand, there isn't any harm in
applying for a couple of jobs for
practice; but don't be surprised if
you don't get offered them—it often
shows when you are not interested.
It helps if you can
find something that
you enjoy.
Another important aspect is, of
course, deciding what you want to
do. Since most of your waking life
is spent at work, (unless you are an
insomniac or thinking of a part-time
career), it helps if you can find
something that you enjoy. Some
people may believe in saving up all
their happy moments for the annual
holiday, but not me—I want to enjoy
life all year round, not just for two
or three weeks in the summer. I find
that I can be paid very adequately
for work which I find rewarding,
and can then afford to spend my
holidays in the many different ways
that I enjoy. By the way, it might be
worth checking how much holiday
your prospective employer does
allow.
I found that it was very difficult,
from an interview, to discover what
was on offer—most of the time was
spent discussing my capabilities.
Therefore, it was essential to visit
the company and have a chance to
chat to the people working there.
This is the only way you can get a
feel for the environment where you
might spend your next couple of
years. Peoples' attitudes to their
work were important; but even
more important, was whether I felt
I could work with them. You always
tend to work as part of a team and
so it helps if you can respect the
wanting work to provide a large
proportion of your ongoing
challenges. I looked for a company
that would continue to present me
with challeng.es and new
opportunities throughout my
career. So, for me, it was important
that the company I joined believed
in career development and hence in
developing my career with me. That
way I have the widest opportunities:
I still have the option to leave if I
don't like the way things are going,
but I have the advantage that the
company itself has an interest in
helping me to progress towards
more senior jobs.
Continued training and personal
development throughout your
career are very important—job
experience, though vitally
important, needs back-up away
from the job—to clarify your ideas
and teach you new ways of tackling
problems. Technical training leading
to membership of a Professional
Institution is very useful, especially
if you wish to work abroad at some
people you work with. A company's
policy to its employees can be read
in its annual report but how that
policy works in practice can only be
ascertained by talking to the people
who work for that company. On the
subject of annual reports—it is often
worth checking that the company
will be able to afford to pay your
salary for the first couple of years'
(and even some profit sharing too!).
Work can be very challenging
wherever you are for the first couple
of months—getting to know
people's names, getting into work
every morning on time, finding
somewhere to live...however, once
you've got the rest of your life
sorted out then you'll probably be-
point in your career. Though you
can obtain training individually, it's
much easier if your company is
committed to it. You can then make
use of established training packages
and tailor them to your own needs.
Location is largely dependent on
personal taste. A factor also to be
taken into account is how often the
location changed! I personally had
no strong feelings on these matters
when I left University—but it does
have a very large impact on your
lifestyle and quality of life. Though
travel often seems exciting, most
people seem to tire of it after a
while—so check you have an option
to change in case you change your
mind! The advantages often seem to
involve increased monetary reward
but there tends to be reasons why
the companies have to pay these
sums. The expatriate lifestyle may
also be attractive—though it is fast
disappearing in most countries. I
was brought up with this style of
living and so fortunately had a
chance to see all its facets; so though
I enjoyed myself greatly living
abroad I had no great urge to spend
all my life there!
Within this country there is great
variety. Remember the North? Well
I have moved up here and have
found many advantages. At
University I chose the job and
company, rather than the location
which I wanted to work in..
However, when I compare myself
to many friends who stayed on in
London, I find I am able to afford
a wider choice of how and where I
wish to live. A recent report
suggested that you have to earn
£37,000 in London to achieve a
similar standard of living to
someone on £20,000 in the North;
and don't worry there are plenty of
ways of spending it up here.
Enjoy the hunt!
Another choice you might have to
consider is between industry and
commerce. Many people think that;
the bright lights of London are more;
attractive, however, I chose,
engineering in Industry and, as I
have already said, I am happy with
that decision.
Finally, I don't suppose I should
finish without mentioning starting
salaries. They are generally
indicative of the quality of person
that the company is seeking to
employ; but only between similar
types of companies. Of equal
importance though is progression of
your salary once starting work.
Watch out for highish salaries that
don't lead anywhere—there is often
limited scope and some companies
operate a 'burn them out' and
'chuck them out' policy. If you are
only after the money then I'm sure
yo can find it for a couple of years—
the problem is how to sustain that
income and then increase it.
I've mentioned a few of the areas
that I thought through before
choosing a job—there are many
more; but I hope I've stirred up
some of the issues that you will have
to consider in the next couple of
months. Enjoy the hunt...!
