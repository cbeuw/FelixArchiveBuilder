Journalism: the inside story
It's been a long time since
journalism could be considered
glamorous, and technical journalism
itself has always played Cinderella
to its television and newspaper
brethren. Once in a while the
nationals find themselves in too
deep and dig the staff of specialist
publications out of their little
cupboards and put them into a chair
to talk about the latest disaster.
The Piper Alpha explosion was
one such incident. Lost among the
jargon and marketspeak of the oil
industry, the nationals were forced
to consult with the editors of the
specialist books who gleaned their
allotted 15 minutes of fame.
Cynical though that view is,
journalism of any kind still beats
working and in the technical market
it can provide a narrow doorway
into the newspapers, radio and
television, if that is what you really
want.
For the science graduate, technical
writing provides the best entry into
journalism as the one thing that
every technical publication is short
of is technical people. The upshot of
this is that anyone leaving college
with anything approaching a science
or engineering degree should not
experience any particular difficulty
in finding a job.
The other traditional channel—the
local newspaper—is practically
closed as it involves competing with
school leavers or English students
who are by far the most favoured
breed in mainstream writing.
Although it has long been a cliche,
English is still considered the subject
for the budding journalist.
So, what does the editor of the
average technical book want?
Generally, the one thing that he or
she needs is some sort of feeling for
the magazine's subject matter rather
than any direct knowledge and it is
very rare that a particular degree
will have any direct relevance to
what is happening to its related
industry.
On the one hand, it means that
people move from one area to
another fairly easily, but it also
means that the science graduate is
just as lost as the ex-English student
when it comes to specific
technologies. However, while
employers still believe that the ex-
engineer is indispensable then the
field is largely clear for IC graduates.
The one other thing that the editor
needs is a writer. Although writing
experience will help, especially if
gleaned on a magazine - college or
otherwise - it is by no means
necessary. Quite a few journalists in
the electronics field a e those who
drifted" into the joh
because it was
something differer t after working as
an engineer for Plessey or Ferranti.
Many did very little actual writing
before joining and, after the odd
training course and some on-the-job
experience, usually end up writing
at least passable English.
The other criteria that the editor
decides by are usually the things
that any employer will cite:
personality, compatibility with other
staff, and interest.
But when you have found
yourself a job at any of the
publishers, what will you be doing?
One thing is for certain, most editors
do not see it as their role to be
digging up the dirt. Most material
comes in the form of a press release,
or conference and occasionally from
the disgruntled telephone call when
someone reveals that the entire
management team of a company
has been made redundant.
How the press release is used
depends largely on the magazine. In
all areas, even those that are sold on
news stands, the books shake down
into three main types: the
newspaper; the technical features
book; and the product book. Many
will combine some of these parts,
but most are referred to as one
category out of the three.
As long as it involves a new
product or service, the product book
will take the press release as it
stands and print it along with a
telephone number for the company
or with a "bingo number" to go on
a reply paid card. Many newspapers
and technical books also incorporate
one of these sections.
The technical features book will
take the release and invite a member
of the company to produce a feature
or will do an in-depth look from the
release. Usually the book will also
print reviews of products carried out
by themselves or people in the
industry.
The newspaper represents the
sharp end of the market since it
involves a starting point for any
number of different stories. The
final article may be a re-run of the
release or it may develop into
something entirely different and
possibly entirely wrong. How
critical the final piece turns out to be
depends on. the editor and,
frequently, on the in-house lawyer.
It is from the technical
newspapers that the nationals, as
well as radio and television, poach
their science correspondents and
editors. And so, if you want to end
up on a daily that is the way to go.
With the exception of the training
courses at Morgan-Grampian and
Reed, the way to get in is to study
the Guardian every Monday for
particular jobs. Generally, you will
be aiming at job titles like reporter,
staff writer and assistant editor.
Editorial assistant is probably one to
avoid as it is often a synonym for
dogsbody. If you can get hold of it,
So, who are you going to work for?
Although there are a number of
fields to get involved in, there are
three fields in which the sheer
number of magazines make it much
easier to move around: electrical and
electronic; computing and
communications; and medical and
pharmaceuticals. Following up on
those are general engineering and
industrial books.
There are two major players in the
trade and technical market — Reed
Business Publishing and Morgan-
Grampian — with a number of
medium-sized and smaller
publishing houses bringing up the
rear. However, if its current spate
of acquisitions continue then the
newly formed Maxwell Business
Communications will represent a
third, but its final shape is far from
settled.
Reed represents the largest share
of the market, with its portfolio
covering just about everything from
farming to computing. Its biggest
money earner is probably Computer
Weekly which has the third largest
circulation of any business
magazine, including news stand
books like the Economist. Other
titles include Electronics Weekly,
European Chemical News,
Computer Talk, Electronic and
Wireless World, Practical
Computing and Systems
International.
Although based in a tower block
out in Sutton, it is one of the better
payers in the industry.
Morgan-Grampian offers what is
regarded as the best training
programme around. However, it
has an odd portfolio that veers from
a trio of electronics publications
through a couple of transport
magazines like Transport Week to
the Engineer, Process Engineering
and Design Engineering.

What's New in Electronics and
What's New in Computing.
VNU is the UK subsidiary of one
of the Netherlands' largest
publishers and specialises in
producing computing magazines as
well as Family Circle. Its most
famous title must be Personal
Computer World, and it also holds
Computing, the magazine which
once threatened Computer Weekly
for leadership but is now losing out.
Part of the success of Computer
Weekly, however, has been the
demise of Computer News, one of
CW Communications' titles. Part of
a worldwide network of computing
publishers, CW is now left with
DEC Today and PC Business World
among others.

Based in Dartford, Findlays is
reckoned to be the best payer in the
market and carries Educational
Computing and Eureka, a sort of
paper Tomorrows World for
engineers.
Among the rest are assorted
publishing houses including
Techpress, Angel, Hanover and
EDA. However, they all have one
thing in common: any publisher of
a decent size is based in London, so
you could be paying extortionate
rents or commuting for four hours
every day for a very long time.
