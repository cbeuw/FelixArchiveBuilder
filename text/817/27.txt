For a bigger bite of the professional apple, few
careers can match the personal and intellectual rewards
you'll find in teaching.
Education is changing, developing to meet the
needs of a skill-hungry society. Young people need your
specialist knowledge, especially in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, technology, modern languages, craft
design andtechnology(CDT) and business studies.
Whatever your chosen discipline,teachingoffers the
chance to share your subject, to bring it alive for young
people whose future depends on the education they
receive.
What you can offer extends far beyond the confines
of your speciality. The impression you make as a person, as
well as yourteaching,will play a vital part inyour students'
broader development.
For adaptable, mobile people who like the idea of
communicating what they know, there are opportunities
across the range of the school curriculum. Mandatory
grants are awarded for the year-long postgraduate
certificate in education (PGCE), plus a £1,300 bursary if
you intend to teach mathematics, physics, technology or
craft design andtechnology(CDT).
Salaries for good honours graduates start at £8,859
and can rise to £18,000 at head of department level. The
selection process begins now. Ask your
