Research is just one of the options
available to a graduate, but it can be
one of the most rewarding.
Research need not just be carried
out in the ivory towers of a
university, it can just as well be
performed in the normal working
environment. Indeed, one of the
most exciting areas yet to be
discovered involves incredibly
mundane equipment but is
providing insights into all areas of
science, including biology and
computing.
In computing, for example, the
rise of object orientated
programming has given rise to the
idea of using actual objects and
moving them to see the results.
This movement of objects forms
a new abstraction in the field of
research with furniture representing
the ideas. At Pickfords R&D centre
in Wokingham, researchers are
looking into how many fields of
science can be regarded in terms of
furniture movement.
However, the project has already
hit troubled waters: there are simply
not enough staff to do the moving.
According to Professor van
Nostrand, "The brains are willing,
but the limbs are weak. It is not
enough to be bright, the likely
candidate must be able to lift a filing
cabinet."
Although short-staffed, the first of
the teams has started field trials in
the town. An assignment at 20
Lavender Avenue has developed
into a full-scale study of neural
networks in the brain, and the
learning patterns involved when the
network is moved to 14 Acacia
Close.
"It's all to do with the filling of the
tea chests," explains Tom Hutter, a
team member. "Simply stuffing one
full of Duane Eddy records is not
enough: too many and the equation
becomes too lopsided, not to
mention impossible to carry."
"Also," adds Diane Warbrick, the
team's leader. "The system is not
just about where the objects are
moved to. The intervening process
counts as well."
She cites the necessary task of tea
making in the process of removing
furniture: it calibrates the system for
later analysis. The tea should be
made in a large teapot and served
into whatever mugs are available
after all of the china has been
packed. The mugs are then lost, as
they must not affect the eventual
move.
Likewise, at least one vase and a
leg from a great aunt's table should
be broken on crossing into the new
house. This process serves to
normalise any results obtained from
the analysis.
Not enough can be made of
packing the lorry for transport,
wherein almost all of the team
members stand in the road and
direct whoever is the youngest to
"put the wardrobe at the back with
the potted plants and mind the
crockery."
Even though the project is still
young, it has already yielded
promising results, not least in
'Diane Warbrick
observing the physiological effects
of excessive tea consumption. "It's
bloody backbreaking," says
Warbrick, "But it's worth the aggro:
I expect to have my first paper out
by Friday."
