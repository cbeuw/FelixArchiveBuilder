Careers
The employer
'How do I choose which employer
to apply to? They all seem much the
same. I'll apply to the seven largest,
most famous; employers with the
most vacancies and that will
probably do.'
It might work but, if you have
spent any time at all choosing what
occupation you wish to follow, it
seems a pity to mess up your future
happiness by failing to carry out
of environment would you enjoy?
What promotion prospects or
training v uld suit you best? Do
you want a . ery open, friendly style
of management or would you prefer
a more conservative formal firm?
What other factors are likely to make
the difference for you between one
employer and another? Then when
face to face with employers or recent
j graduates, you can question them
adequate research on your
prospective employer. There are five
Directories of employers of
graduates, Register of Graduate
Employment and Training (RoGET);
Graduate Employment and Training
(GET); Graduate Opportunities (GO);
Directory of Opportunities for
Graduates (DOG) and Directory of
Opportunities in New Technology
(DONT). Therse are a good source
for your preliminary list of possible
employers. Besides outlining the
vacancies that they may have, they
may tell you about the Company's
size, its location, its pattern of
employment and even a little of its
philosophy. Many employers
produce special Graduate brochures
which provide profiles of recent
graduate entrants of the 'Day in the
Life of...' variety. There are many
videos for those who prefer
watching and listening to reading.
These can be viewed in the Careers
Video Room. Key from Sherfield
Room 309. Although all these
sources will tell you something of
the companies, they are produced
and written by the employers
themselves and therefore are
unlikely to paint the companies in
anything other than glossy terms.
The same can be said of the recent
graduates brought along to
company presentations. A company
is unlikely to bring along people
who think it's a foul company in
which to work. So how can you find
out which company is for you?
Firstly, you must know what you
want from an employer. What sort
closely. The Careers Fair is a good
j place to start. You might ask them
why they think you should work for
i them rather than for X and Co
although don't sound too arrogant
when doing so! Another valuable
way of finding out about different
employers is at the old students'
Association Careers evening.
Once you have narrowed the field
of employers, you can save
everyone an awful lot of time by
checking whether the companies
actually have vacancies in the areas
of which you are applying. Every
year, a well known computing
company is inundated with
applications for computer
programming jobs. They do have
between 400 and 500 vacancies but
not for computer programmers.
If the company is visiting the
campus during the Graduate
Recruitment Programme then you
can obtain the application forms
from the Careers library otherwise
you will have to apply directly to the
company.
And finally, think about 'falling
back positions'. Please consider the
wisdom of only applying it to the
big glamourous, well known
companies. Every year on the
Imperial Graduate Recruitment
Programme, perfectly respectable
companies have to cancel their visits
through lack of applications. Just
think what it would do to your
chances of success if you applied to
such a company.
Applications
Books have been written on this
topic and so it is not particularly
easy to condense into a couple of
hundred words or so.
A good application is absolutely
crucial in seeking any job—without
it, you have no chance of an
interview, let alone the job! The
reasons why most applications fail
are because they are badly
presented (illegible writing, coffee
stains, etc), badly thought out and
poorly expressed. One employer
reported he had rejected 90% on
those grounds. Perhaps more
typically an employer with about 15
jobs might receive 700 applications
and these would be reduced to
about 150 for the first interview.
Thus it really is significant to get the
interview.
What then is the 'secret'? Actually
there is no secret at all; just plain
common sense. So here then are a
few tips.
1. Think carefully about what kind
of job you want, identify possible
employers then read up about them
and their vacancies.
2. Follow the instructions on the
form carefully. If they say 'attach a
photograph and write in black ink'
then you cannot expect too much if
you do not send a photo and write
in blue ink (as a depressing number
of applicants did for one employer
last year).
3. Work out in advance your
answers to the questions on the
form.
4. Draft and edit your answers to fit
the space provided.
5. Answer all the questions. If one
is not really applicable to you,
explain why that is so and do not
leave the space blank.
6. Keep it all simple; keep a copy.
7. Try and view your application
from the employers position. Would
you be impressed by the answers?
It is not likely that you would be if
there were broad unsupported
generalisations, for example; T can
communicate well and get on with
people'—is the evidence elsewhere
on the form?
8. If you want more help or advice
see one of the Careers Advisers. If
also after a few applications you
haven't been invited to an
interview, come and see us again.
Interviews
'The unspoken message'—When
called to an interview, the unspoken
message from the employer is that
they like the look of you on paper
and so wish to meet you to confirm
that view. The invitation to the
second interview is, that having
checked you out, 'we'd now like to
give you the proper interview from
which we may make you an offer'.
Thus, the first interview, often
held in College and certainly for
those employers listed in the GRP
Programme, is relatively short.
Much will consist of points in you
application—'tell me more about
that', 'why did you do that?',
'describe your project'. In some
cases there may be a little technical
content. The interview is also a
chance for you to ask questions—
so have some prepared! In fact be
prepared all round—dress suitably,
arrive in good time, be friendly and
positive, look at your interviewer,
be prepared to smile, be honest—if
you don't know the answer to a
question, say so and don't waffle!
The second interview is normally
on the employers premises. This
gives a special chance for you to
evaluate the employer (after all it is
a two way process)—does the place
seem a good one in which to work?
Are the employers friendly? How
are recent graduates getting on? The
employers may have a variety of
tests for you to do—some use
psychometric tests, some use group
discussions—here the important
thing is not so much whether you
get the right answers to the problem
but how you deal with other people,
how do you react under stress.
Finally, there will be the interview
itself, very often before a board. Of
course you will be nervous but the
confidence that comes from a good
preparation can help a lot.
Once again the Careers Service
can be part of that preparation. We
are easy to find, easy to consult and
we are running a comprehensive
programme of talks and seminars,
we also have a lot of literature, so
if you want any help, do come and
see us.
