Careers
Your last year and you haven't a clue what to do next? Awful, isn't it?
Perhaps if you forget about it, it won't happen? Perhaps if you just send
| off thousands of application forms, someone will give you some sort o:
â€¢a job which you might enjoy? No, better just ignore the problem. No,
" know, go and see the Careers Advisers, they'll tell you what to do.
Unfortunately, we can't tell you
what to do, we can help you
towards the decision, point you in
the right direction to get you started,
test out whether you're being
realistic but, ultimately the decision
is yours. You're on your own on this
one! So where do you start? Well
you could stick a pin into every third
page of the Graduate Recruitment
Programme booklet or you could try
to be a bit more systematic about it.
First of all, you could think about it
yourself, try to compile a list of your
characteristic traits, your values,
what you want out of life and your
skills, what you're good at, not
forgetting, of course, those things
that interest you and that you enjoy.
Then, when you look at job
descriptions, you can compare them
with your personal profile and see
which ones match and, hey presto,
you know what you want to do
next.
The trouble is, it's not so easy to
identify all these things about
yourself and so here's some tips as
to how you might go about it. Look
at your life so far. Why did you
come to Imperial College, why are
you reading Mathematics or Biology
or whatever? What have you
enjoyed out of the experience and
why? What have you hated? Was
there anything in your holiday jobs
that you found fun or that you
discovered you were particularly
good at? How about leisure
interests, any clues there? If you
can't do it this way round, try
looking at the jobs first. Read as
many job descriptions and adverts
as you can and when you spot one
that takes your fancy, try and
analyse what it is that attracts you
and then you can look for other
occupations containing these
factors. Perhaps you've seen or
talked to people whose jobs seem
interesting. Why, what was it about
that job? Your Careers Adviser can
help you with this task or analyising
your skills and needs by asking
questions and checking out whether
you really mean it when you say, for
example, that all you care about is
becoming a millionaire by the time
you're 30!
There are brief descriptions in the
back of the Directory 'ROGET', but
for more detailed descriptions,
consult the series of booklets
published by the Association of
Graduate Careers Advis >ry
Services, all available free of charge
from the Careers Library.
If you find all this totally
impossible and your Careers
Adviser can't help you get started
on the trail, then you may be
recommended to complete a
Gradscope Questionnaire which is
a fiendishly clever little toy. You
answer fifty questions and the
computer programme comes up
with your top fen jobs....but alas
you've still got to answer the
questions: What are you good at?
What do you enjoy? What do you
want to do next?
Have you enjoyed yourself so
much as a student that you're
thinking of going on to take a
further qualification? There are
many reasons for continuing your
studies but merely having enjoyed
your undergraduate years may not
be an adequate motive. Being a
postgraduate may turn out to be
very different from being an
undergraduate. Are the elements of
your undergraduate life that you
have enjoyed still present at
postgraduate level?
Another pretty pathetic reason for
taking a further course is because
you can't think of anything else to
do or because this careers choice
business is just too difficult. What's
going to make it easier to think of
something else, or to decide after
another year or three at College? If
you just continue to study and take
no active steps toward the dreaded
future, you'll find yourself in exactly
the same dithering situation, only
slightly older!
But beware, the worst reason of
all is falling prey to flattery. You
may feel that you're not susceptible
but come June, when your degree
results are out and notable
professors ask if you'd like to do a
PhD with them, it's so easy to be
overwhelmed by the ideas, without
thinking out the reality. Should this
happen to you, beware false pride.
Beware the professors have reasons
of their own for wanting PhD
students and before jumping onto
a three year project, weigh up the
pros and cons and analyse whether
it's really the right move for you.
Before you get the impression that
I'm totally against postgraduate
studies, here are some more positive
reasons for this course of action.
You may simply not feel finished
with studying and decide that you
want to learn more. Perhaps there's
a part of your undergraduate course
that you have found particularly
interesting and would like to study
in depth. Many a masters course
caters for this need, eg
Astrophysics.
The most obvious reason is
vocational. Your chosen career may
require a PhD or a further
qualification, eg research in the
Pharmaceutical industry or
teaching. You may feel that it will
be easier to get a job in your chosen
field if you possess a further
qualification, eg Geophysics or
Petroleum Engineering. You may
wish to change direction and
another course can often help, eg
Information Technology. Another
word of caution is required here. It's
easy to be misled into believing a
course is more vocational than it
really is. Admissions tutors are sure
to tell you how useful their courses
are and so make sure you ask what
percentage of their previous
scholars are in employment and
what they are doing. You might also
check the value of your chosen
course with some of the employers
at the Careers Fair or discuss it with
a disinterested person like a Careers
Adviser.
Having made the decision to
prolong your student days, the
obvious next step is to decide where
you want to study. The Careers
Office, Sherfield 309, keeps a
reference copy of 'Graduate
Studies' which lists all the PhD and
Masters and many of the Diploma
courses available in the UK. We can
also point you in the right direction
for information on studying abroad.
The Lyon Playfair Library has many
prospectuses and also keeps a copy
of the 'Directory of Research in
British Universities and
Polytechnics' which contains
detailed titles of PhD projects which
have been carried out recently. Of
course, you'll need to check
whether you can get the money for
your studies and whether you need
any pre-course experience. To be
safe, you should think about
applying for PhDs and Masters
around Christmas but for many
vocational courses like teaching, you
should be applying now. If you
think that there's the slightest
chance of wanting to continue your
studies, then apply. If you get an
offer of a place, you can always turn
it down, otherwise you may find
yourself having to wait a year
because you decided too late.
