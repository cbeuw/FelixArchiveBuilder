NETBALL
Good start
IC 1-50
LSP-11
Last Saturday morning an
exceptionally bleary eyed netball
team assembled at South
Kensington station for the first ULU
match of the season. The team
trundled over to Russell Square to
play London School of Pharmacy (or
SOPS as they call themselves) on
their court situated in an 'innercity
farm' complete with sheep!
We looked very scruffy next to
smartly kitted LSP in our odd
assortment of tracksuits, skirts and
tops (lack of funds for kit from IC
Union) but fortunately the netball
was better than our strip. Lunchtime
practices have certainly paid off. The
team played well together and for
once on LSP's court unhampered by
sheep. By half-time IC had
established a clear lead and went on
to win without seriously maiming
the LSP team.
FOOTBALL
Top of the
Table
IC II—6
UC II—1
With IC top of the table, and UC
second, this looked as if it would be
IC's toughest game yet, and my
word it was! UC kicked off, and for
ten minutes pressurised the IC
defence. But with the class and
coolness of Russ Dark and Jezz
Holland in the heart of the defence,
goalkeeper Webster Nonde was
never bothered. Then came the
breakthrough. Good work on the
right from Ash Jalan allowed the
cross, and Rackesh Muthoo was
there to poke the ball home. The
second, ten minutes later was
created in a similar fashion, with
Guy Phiri scoring from an awkward
header. IC went forward again, and
just before half-time, and Ed Coates
corner was cleverly dummied by
Russ Dark to leave debutant Kev
Graves the easiest of chances to
make it 3-0. After the switch, UC
pressurised again, but it was IC who
scored through Adam Thomas, on
the break. Adam then added a fifth
as IC began to play some lovely
football. UC then scored, but it was
IC who had the last laugh. Freddie
Dadze wriggled his way through the
UC defence, and then calmly placed
the ball under the keeper. After this
demolition of one of the strongest
teams in division 1, IC II look to be
in for another successful season.

ORIENTEERING
November
Classic
The morning after Guy Fawkes
Night was incredibly foggy, as if all
the bonfire smoke had failed to
disperse, and the sight made me
wonder if it was worth getting out
of bed. Alright so orienteers are only
supposed to need a map and
compass, but there are limits! I
made the rendezvous with a nice
comfy van which whisked us off to
the New Forest.
By the time we arrived the day
had metamorphosed into a bright,
sunny and warmish sort of day and,
pausing only to don our 'O' suits,
we set off , one by one to run
through the beautiful woodland.
For those who think they
understand orienteering, but don't,
it consists of getting from certain
points in the countryside to certain
other ones, preferably in a
suggested order and fairly rapidly.
The most amusing feature of this
trip was the unusual presence of
camouflaged 'watchers', behind
trees and in hides who became very
secretive when asked what on Earth
they were doing. One theory is that
their mastermind (Dr Spellenberg of
Southampton University) was
reseraching the 'environmental
impact of orienteering'.
Well, my old expedition injury
(acquired in the Karakoram you
know) played up, so my
performance was a little below best
(so I'm told) but what do you care
anyway?
The sport is truly open to all and
the club will caterr for absolutely
anyone (although two legs and the
ability to run 100 yards at the finish
are a basic requirement). If you are
mildly interested, call internal 6776
for Andrew Fazakerley (club
captain).
RUGBY
Unbeaten
After a particularly good intake
during Freshers' Fair, Imperial
College rugby is still unbeaten. The
Club is putting out two teams every
Wednesday and Saturday which are
nearly the same standard.
IC 1st XV's most pleasing victory
will most probably be against the
formerly unbeaten club side,
Orlcons FP. This performance
showed a lot of determination,
especially among the forwards, who
finally secured us a place in the 3rd
round of the Middlesex Cup.
After our first UAU game against
Sussex, we were to play LSE last
Wednesday. Due to lack of
concentration IC were only 8-6 up
at half time. During half time
everyone got a kick up the bum
from the captain, S Blanco, and IC
jumped into a higher gear pinning
LSE in their 22 for the rest of the
match.
A powerful drive from the
forwards was finished off by a try
from H Fadge. Three tries followed
from Hughes, Anderson and
Watson which brought the final
score to 30-6.
Division 6
IC VI-1
LSE V—3
Todd Hansen's first goal of the
season, a 30 yard drive that left the
keeper clutching thin air, was not
enough as IC dropped some
valuable points in their bid for
promotion. Playing yet again with
only 10 men, IC were unlucky not
to get a draw with Albert Wong
being denied by the crossbar and a
fine save by the keeper.
M E N S H O C K E Y
Demolition
IC 2nds-8
L S E - 0
Although some warned of
compacency the 2nd XI went into
their second UAU game with high
hopes after a resounding 4-1
thrashing of Sussex. Our worst fears
were realised when we learned our
goalkeeper had opted for a lie-in.
However, our forwards produced
the goods against an opposition
feared throughout the land.
The second half saw the demise
of your faithful correspondent, as a
fatal head injury forced him off the
field with concussion leaving the
remainder of the game shrouded in
mystery. The result, however, was
never in question.

UAU Success
As usual before the badminton
season has really got going we have
been thrown in at the deep end with
some tough UAU matches. Last
week we travelled down to Sussex
University where, despite having
trouble with the drift on court and
the confusing array of coloured lines
on the floor our mens teams
triumphed 8-1 (mens I) and 5-4
(mens II).
Unfortunately the ladies were
defeated 9-0 by a Sussex team that
didn't really contain any players of
spectacular ability. The main
problem was that we were playing
with totally new partners and
confusion in positioning caused
many points to be lost. This is
supported by the fact that the scores
improved steadily as the afternoon
went on.
