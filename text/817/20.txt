spending $1000 million on the arms
industry generates 76,000 jobs. The
same money used for construction
gives 100,000 jobs and in health
would give 139,000 jobs. The move
to high technology means a loss of
20,000 jobs in military related work
in Britain between 1981 and 1985,
despite an increase in our share of
the global arms market. Arms
themselves don't even make
economic sense, since once made
they can generate no further wealth.
But detailed plans for converting
military industry to socially useful
production have been dismissed out
of hand by industry and by
governments of both main parties.
Why this reluctance in the W
to put an end to the arms trade? Are
arms companies just satisfying a
"market need"? For a start, the
world economy is grossly distorted.
Despite gaining official
independence from colonial masters
in the years after 1945, most
developing nations find themselves
locked into a system in which they
are suppliers of raw materials and
the consumers • of western
manufactures. The main global
economic powers are the
governments of the rich
industrialised nations and
transnational companies (TNCs).
The TNCs like to invest in countries
with low production costs and
where they control the profits. Third
World elites sympathetic to TNCs
tend to be those most willing to
align with the strategic interests of
western governments. A good
example is Malaysia, where
approximately 50% of
manufacturing output is controlled
by TNCs.
But the profit driven business L.
arms export doesn't even stick to
this strategic and economic logic.
Britain was selling arms to
Argentina up to eight days before
the invasion of the
Malvinas/Falkland Islands! The sad
reality is that the arms trade is
fuelled by the search for profits and
power and works hand in hand
with governments such as our own.
Its existence is totally opposed to the
well being of ordinary people. There
have been some limited successes
with campaigns against specific
arms deals and for some further
information as to how to get
involved with fighting the arms
trade contact the organisations listed
below.
At the present time, a large
proportion of science related jobs
and funding remains with the MoD
and companies like British
Aerospace, GEC, Marconi etc. It is
a matter of personal choice and
circumstance as to how you decide
to deal with this fact. Nevertheless,
to accept the status quo is to side
with the powerful.
Malaysia
On the 27th September Dr Mahathir
Mohamad* the Malaysian Prime
Minister, visited Mrs Thatcher at 10
Downing Street to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding for
the purchase of over £1 billion worth
of military equipment during the
next fifteen to twenty years.
Contracts with individual
manufacturers are being handled by
the Ministry of Defence's Defence
Export Services Organisation
(DESO). The details have yet to be
worked out, but the equipment sold
is understood to include:
- a dozen Tornado fighter aircraft
from BAe
- twelve Rapier air defence missile
systems from BAe
- 105mm light gums from Royal
Ordinance (a BAe subsidiary)
- about thirty FH70 towed howitzers
from VSEL
- electronics for the Tornados and air
defence radar from GEC Marconi
- sonar, radar and communications
equipment from Plessey
- about 50 Javelin ground-to-air
missile launchers from Shorts
- a refurbished Oberon class
submarine
- a training programme
- contracts for naval construction
and repair facilities in Malaysia.
It is not entirely clear why the
Malaysian government should want
to spend so much money on
Afgan Rebel with US SA missile
weaponry. In reply to an
interviewer's question, Dr Mahathir
told ITN that it was routine
rearmament. Britain has been
making strenuous efforts to sell
more arms to south east Asia, and
the DESO opened an office in Kuala
Lumpur in 1986.
No details have been given on any
credit terms, but Malaysia will be
paying in oil, natural gas, and other
commodities, in a series of barter
deals. Overdraft facilites will
probably be provided by Britain as
a supplier of credit, and British
companies will be encouraged to
invest in Malaysia. There are also
reports that Malaysia wants more
aid money in return for the arms
deal. Britain does not give aid for
military purposes, but parallel talks
are said to be taking place about an
increase in UK aid to Malaysia
through the Overseas Development
Administration.
During the past year in Malaysia,
the leader of the opposition and
other political figures have been
detained without trial, dissidents
within Dr Mahathir's party have
been purged, newspapers have
been closed, and six supreme court
judges (including the most senior)
have been suspended. Although
Malaysia has been one of the few
democratic countries in south east
Asia, two former Malaysian Prime
Ministers are said to feel that Dr
Mahathir is abusing his power.
Nothing suggests that Mrs Thatcher
raised the question of human rights
during the Downing Street meeting.
Conversion
In Britain, around 120,000 people
are employed in manufacturing
military goods for sale abroad.
Campaigning for an end to arms
exports without considering those
whose jobs are affected would be
irresponsible, hence the conversion
of weapons factories to encompass
"socially useful" output is
encouraged.
There have been many attempts
at conversion since the second
world war, both in Britain and
abroad. Although there have been
few successes, most have proved to
be technically feasible, the main
obstacle being lack of political will.
Many of the initiatives for
conversion have come from trade
unionists who have been sufficiently
forward looking to see that secure
and satisfying jobs require long term
change. Unfortunately,
management prefers short term,
guaranteed profits, so that weapons
manufacture, which offers low risks
and has taxpayer subsidised
research and marketing, is very
attractive.
In 1976, faced with prospects of
redundancies, the Lucas Aerospace
ComfTine Shop Stewards
Committee (LACSSC) developed
the Alternative Corporate Plan to
protect the employees' right to work
and to encourage the production of
at least some socially useful goods.
Meeting social needs rather than
creating profit was the main
concern, as with subsequent
schemes at Vickers, British
Aerospace, Faslane and the GLC In
addition, the Plan specified that all
members of the workforce should
have real influence over the
organisation of production by
increasing industrial democracy.
Ideas for new products were
collected from the employees,
leading to 150 proposals in a
number of areas - transport,
alternative energy sources, oceanics,
telechirics (remote* control) and
medical equipment.
The management refused to meet
the Combine or consider the Plan.
Neither the DTI, the Labour
government nor the TUC gave any
assistance. In the following years,
Lucas closed factories and adopted
divide-and-rule tactics against the
unions. Despite this, the Plan has
been successful in that it has been
the inspiration for other schemes.
