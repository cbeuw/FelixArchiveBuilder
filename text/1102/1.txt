Council Votes for
Single Entry... Just
ANDREW OFORI
Controversy raged last week at a
a packed council meeting, which
discussed whether IC and its
Medical Schools
should enter BUSA
(British University
Sports Association)
as a single body or
separately.
In the past few weeks
there has been a signif-
icant campaign to
decide before BUSA
forces a joint entry
upon Imperial College.
Presently, IC and
the IC School Of
Medicine (ICSM) enter
BUSA event separately. Hands up:
However St. Mary's
medics compete for IC teams
which currently flouts BUSA regula-
tions, where students are only eligi-
ble to play for the institution with
which they are registered; there is
no specific dispensation for med-
ical schools. Due to the unique
position of London institutions,
BUSA have turned a blind eye to
the situation until now. Other
London colleges have merged with
Council votes last Tuesday. Photo:
their affiliated medical schools and
may now find themselves in the
same predicament. This made
Tuesday's decision particularly sig-
nificant as it was likely to be the line
the University of London adopts on
the subject.
Katie Armstrong, the ICSMU
president submitted a motion
which proposed that St. Mary's
and Charing Cross make up one
entry, IC being the
other. This would
mean medics could no
longer represent IC,
and she claimed that
this would furhter the
accessibility of univer-
sity sport. Former ICU
president Eric Allsop
tabled an opposing
motion for single-entry
from 1998, IC and
ICSM entering as one.
Medics claimed
single-entry would
Ivan Chan result in fewer stu-
dents being able to
represent their colleges. The 1CSM-
SU president stressed that universi-
ties have battled hard to keep
Wednesday afternoons free for
sport countrywide, and therefore

ULU Under Fire Over Fees
TONY OFORI
The University of London Union
(ULU) is under attack from sever-
al London colleges who that
claim their subscription fee is too
high. The student unions of IC,
the London School of Economics,
King's and Queen Mary &
Westfield Colleges all believe that
their membership fee is not justi-
fied by their usage of ULU facili-
ties.
"Screw you" were the words
used by the King's College student
paper Roar in reply to the 1% dis-
count off their ULU subscription
offered by the committee. Rob
Clark, ICU's Deputy President
(Finance &. Services) questions
whether ULU provide "value for
money" and believes that "the cur-
rent situation can be improved".
ULU is situated in Malet Street
where they provide a range of ser-
vices and facilities ranging from
student representation to bars and
sports halls. This year the ICU bill
for ULU was in excess of £90,000,
a sum chosen after a survey con-
ducted three years ago. It is
thought that the figures obtained in
this survey are no longer applicable
and a new one should be conduct-
ed by an independent body; how-
ever nothing has changed as yet.
An indication of the inaccuracy of
the survey is the underestimate of
46% ULU usage attributed to the
closest college, University College
London.
The tone of Roar over the last
month suggests that King's College
London (KCL) is incensed by ULU's
unwillingness to reduce their
£108,000 bill. They believe their
own facilities reduce the expected
demand on ULU by KCL students,
and if a compromise is not reached
they may consider disaffiliation.
Such a step could possibly lead to
ULU collapsing. KCL are still nego-
tiating with ULU, but Roar are call-
ing for a referendum on member-
ship. They have also accused ULU
of underhand tactics in their han-
dling of the dispute, claiming that
the committee are blackmailing the
biggest student paper in Europe,
London Student, to "keep quiet on
the issue", and threatening to
remove KCL sports teams from
ULU unless a deal is signed.
Despite the claims of unfairnes,
Siva Ganeshanandan, President of
ULU, holds that value for money is
being provided, and he believes
KCL will not pull out of ULU. The
discussions currently taking place
between KCL and ULU could prove
pivotal to the future of the latter,
so ULU have to tread carefully. At
the moment ICU does not consider
their own condition a crisis but a
source said they do think that
something needs to be done.
