Did you know that not one theory
about evolution has ever been sci-
entifically proven? If your response
to this is along the lines of "The evi-
dence for evolution proves that it is
true - there's no other way!" then
perhaps you are in fact responding
to the overwhelming presence of
evolution teaching in the media,
and educational arena, rather than
the actual scientific evidence.
Sounds harsh? Read the quotes
mutations (misleadingiy termed
"natural selection" - they deny
without a thought the existence of
a Selector).
The alternative to the unproved
theory of evolution is that we are
here by design. And if by design,
there must be a designer. There is
no third option.
"The spontaneous generation
of a living organism is impossible ...
The only alternative to sponta-
neous generation is to believe in a
single, primary act of supernatural
closed system decay over time to a
less complex and lower energy
state; and the genetic evidence
that genetic mutations are known
to be almost always harmful and
destructive. Most importantly,
there is no scientific evidence of
such evolutionary changes.
Considering that not one trace
of the assumed vast primeval
chemical soup has been found any-
where in the bedrock of the earth,

dreds of billions of assumed "miss-
ing links" - intermediate species -

Incredible? Why? There is nothing
unscientific about a theory of ori-
gins which includes creation and a
Designer. The scientific evidence,
in fact, supports this theory the
most, believe it or not! It is only
hostility towards God, not any
actual scientific evidence in favour
of evolution, that has led most sci-
entists to believe evolution, instead
of accepting its only alternative -
special creation by God. A thinking

origins and evidence and thinking
for yourself. It is science without
any religious prejudice whatsoever.
Darwinism, the most common the-
ory of evolution, claims that every
single feature of the animal and
plant world was caused by random
accumulated genetic copying
errors ("mutations") - personified,
almost deified as "Chance" - and
random destruction of individuals
within a group which have "bad"
creation. There is no I hind posi*

Thousands of PhD and Masters

Duane T. Gish. The following is an

world.

Professor Schildknecht undertook
an investigation of the Bombardier
Beetle (Brachinus) and found that it
has two glands which produce a
liquid mixture; two connected stor-
age chambers; two combustion
chambers; and two external tubes
which can be aimed like flexible
guns in the tail of a bomber.
When analysed, the stored liq-
uid was found to contain 10%,
hydroquinone and 23% hydrog^nl
peroxide. Now, this is art e^?lo- j

You see, he didn't need the
inhibitor until he mixed up the
chemicals. When he mixed up the
chemicals he blew himself up. So
he could not pass the information

did not bav&gigv offspring. So
there's no way to puss down this

Because now he has just got the

And he stores them. He's got to

How did the beetle work this
out by evolution. Let's assume that
millions of years ago, there was this
little beetle. Let's call him Beetle
Bailey. And one day his mum and
dad gave him a chemistry set for
his birthday, and so, down in the
basement laboratory, he was
experimenting. He mixed the solu-
tion of hydroquinone and hydrogen
peroxide - and Boom! He blew
himself up and was splattered all
around the walls of the laboratory
and that was the end of Beetle
Bailey.
Well, for hundreds of thou-
sands of generations, millions of
years, these beetles were mixing
up hydrogen peroxide and hydro-
quinone and blowing themselves
up. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
For thousands of generations.
Then, for some strange reason,

say. Now, here we are. We have
the two chemicals, the storage
chambers, the inhibitor, the anti-
inhibitor, and the combustion
chambers. We're all set.
No, not quite. In fact, the bee-
tle has got to have everything
timed right. He has to have the
right communication network.
Imagine: he's got that chemical
and he squirts it into the combus-
t i o n chambers and his friend

assume that somehow it did. He
has it, and he mixes his chemicals
and what do they do? Nothing. The
mixture just sits there and corrodes
his innards. This also continues for
thousands of generations, millions
of years.
Now, he did not need an anti-
inhibitor until he had an inhibitor.
And he didn't need the inhibitor
until he had the chemicals. But,
let's assume that one of these little
beetles invents an anti-inhibitor.
Tremendous evolutionary triumph?
No. Completely fatal. You see, all
he's got is the storage chambers.
He mixes up the chemicals, adds
the inhibitor, then the anti-inhibitor
- and Boom! Gone again! So,
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! For
thousands of generations, millions
of years, he blew himself up yet
again.
You see, he must have combus-
tion chambers. But he doesn't
need the combustion chambers
until he's got the two chemicals,
the inhibitor and the anti-inhibitor.
So, why would he invent the com-
bustion chambers, except by hind-
sight?
Well, somehow, for some rea-
son, it finally came about, let us
He's got to have the communica-
tion network. He's got to know
when he's threatened. He's got to
know who is an enemy and who is
not. And he's got to have every-
thing complete from the start.
Complete from the start."
Such a complex and interde-
pendent defence system could not
possibly have evolved in the bom-
bardier beetle. It is plain that this
creature could not have designed
or created its own organs or sys-
tems and that random genetic
copying errors (i.e. evolution) could
not possibly have created it. Just by
being, this little beetle demands a
Creator.
Perhaps the theory for evolu-
tion that you may have seen, be it
from the media, museums, or even
universities and schools, isn't quite
so scientific' as it is claimed to be.
Perhaps there is another theory,
most often ridiculed, which is in
fact based more on our scientific
knowledge that you might think. Is
it time to change your thinking?
