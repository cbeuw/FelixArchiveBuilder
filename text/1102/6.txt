C R U D E RESPONSE
Dear Felix,
After reading the disturbing
article, "Crude on Campus", in last
week's edition, I feel compelled to
write and express my support for
Roger Geffen in speaking out about
something which concerns and
frightens me, especially as a poten-
tial employee of an oil company. I
am constantly worried that
Imperial structures its courses, par-
ticularly in engineering subjects, on
the specific needs of individual
companies. I speak as a student of
chemical engineering where most
weeks we receive visits and pre-
sentations from companies seeking
recruits for vacation work and full
time postgraduate employment.
How many of us, though, actually
stop to think what we potentially
sacrifice ethically when we apply
for, and accept, positions within
these companies? Certainly the
prospect of a high salary is a pow-
erful incentive, but surely we
should be probing to discover any
undisclosed policies that there may
be?
1 strongly urge anyone who
feels the same way to find out as
much information as possible
about sources of funding within
their department and employer's
backgrounds. If these allegations
are true, can Imperial really afford
to be associated with these com-
panies?

To the sex-mad raving loony
(your words' not mine)
There is only one place that fits
the description you made:

All the London cabbies' know it and
medics (and their guests') get in

INCREDIBLE - A
C O M P L I M E N T
Dear Jeremy
Indeed the quality of Felix
seems to be improving by the
week! I particularly appreciate the
weekly feature and many of the
arts reviews are well written. The
latter are so good that I often want
to go and see a play; as for taking
the mickey out of the Turner Prize
Exhibition, encourage Clare to write
more of such stuff.
Finally, I'd like to comment on
the news item on page 2 (Imperial
students fall victim to conmen).
This story sounds all too familar to
me: about 18 months ago I was
approached by a young woman,
claiming to be a tourist who had
also lost all her belongings and
would I give her some money for
her fare. I was not convinced that
her story was true and instinctively
said 'no'. I think the moral is that all
of us should be cautious: it is not
just men in smart suits who con
others into departing with their
money.
Please keep up the good work.

TAKE A DEEP
BREATH, HERE W E

Dear Felix
My word, a controversial fea-
ture (issue 1100) Well done! If it
makes peopie think about what
they believe and why they believe it
then it is no bad thing. Having said
that it does seem that Matteo
Floris is confused about what he
believes. Does he believe (as so
many do) that the Bible is old hat,
suitable only for the credulous and
those born before the enlighten-
ment, or does be think that the
Bible can provide some of the
answers along with the scriptures
of all the other world religions? It is
not clear which view is being pro-
moted. He also vociferously rejects
the Catholic church of the Middle
ages, whilst implying that the
church of today is exactly the
same. It is most defiantly not!
Much is made of the renais-
sance (aka the enlightenment and
the age of reason). However peo-
ple carefully forget that the theo-
logical reformation preceded and
overlapped with it. The reforma-
tion put very simply was a time
during which the philosophers and
theologians of the day discovered
what the scriptures (i.e. the Bible)
have to say about the Creator God,
and the relationship that he has
with his creation, namely humanity.
Before, during and after this time
the Catholic Church remained
focused on the supposedly higher
spiritual issues, and had accepted
the idea that what is natural is
somehow evil. With the reforma-
tion came the Christian under-
standing that in the beginning God
had created all things, and that all
things had been "good", though
this goodness had been spoiled by
humanities rebellion against God.
This belief is in a God who has cre-
ated a universe that is not part of
his essence, but is permeated with
his presence. It means that
Christianity gives a certainty of
objective reality, and of cause and
effect, a certainty that is strong
enough to build on. Indeed Galileo
was not trying to disprove the exis-
tence of God. He with other early
scientists (Copernicus, Faraday and
Francis Bacon to name but a few)
shared the same outlook of
Christianity in believing there is a
reasonable God who had created a
reasonable universe; and thus man,
by use of his reason could find out
the universe's form.
Therefore when Galileo
observed the planets and the
moons of Jupiter, he was doing it
within the bounds of his Christian
faith, as a reasoning, reasonable
creation of a reasonable Creator
God. The reaction of the "Holy
Inquisition" was as much against
the "heretical" theology of the
reformed church as it was against
those scientists who dared to
observe Gods creation as it really
was. It must also be borne in mind
that the Catholic Church had con-
trol over vast areas of land and
huge numbers of people, they were
a thoroughly corrupt bunch who
had an intellectual, and supersti-
tious hold over even the educated
population. They achieved this by
