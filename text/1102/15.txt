As many of you old lags know, my opinions
are not confined to politics and Sherfield. At
this time of year, I like to save you the price
of a paper by telling you what you should be
watching this Christmas. You know you can
trust me. It comes as no surprise that yet
again the BBC have wiped the floor with the
opposition. The big films in Radio Times are
all on BBC 1, namely Clear and Present
Danger (9.30pm, 23 December), The Naked
Gun 33'/i: The Final Insult (9pm, Christmas
Eve), The Flintstones (4.10pm, Christmas
Day), The Mask (6.50pm, Christmas Eve),
True Lies (10.15pm, Boxing Day) and Forrest
Gump (9.00pm, New Year's Day). All fairly
good films and well worth watching, even if
you have probably seen them all before.
Elsewhere, there are some absolute
gems. The Beeb are having a series of
Carry On films, though some would
argue they do every Christmas. Don't
Lose Your Head (11.40pm, 22
December), Loving (1.10am, Christmas
Day), Girls (1.20am, Boxing Day),
Again Doctor (11.40pm, 27
December), the superb Up the Khyber
(11.45pm, 30 December), at Your
Convenience (1.00am, New Year's
Eve), Abroad (12.55am, New Year's
Day) and Behind (1 1,50pm. 2 January).
Not the optimum selection, but a few
corkers all the same.
For as many years as I can remem-
ber, The Italian Job has been shown on
Christmas Eve. Disastrously, it does not
feature anywhere in the terrestrial
schedules. Some comfort can be
derived from Zulu (BBC2, 5.45pm, 29
December), which gave birth to the
immortal words, 'Don't chuck those
bloody spears at me.' Continuing the
military theme, The Bridge On The
River Kwai (BBC2, 9.10pm, 20 December) is
quite superb. The number of all-time greats is
fairly high this year, and provides a good
opportunity to fill in the odd gap in one's
knowledge. The epic Gone With The Wind
(C5, 7.10pm, Boxing Day) may have been on
a hundred times before, but remains timeless,
as does the Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and
Coronets (C4, 5.30pm, Christmas Day). Also
Y O U R
on Christmas Day is Willy Wonka and The
Chocolate Factory (BBC1, 11.05am), which
hasn't been on for years. Compulsory viewing
applies to The Return of The Pink Panther
(1TV, 3.05pm, 29 December), a veritable tour
de farce due solely to the incomparable Peter
Sellers. James Stewart is, unsurprisingly, the
subject of many tributes, but the best must be
a screening of Mr Smith Goes to Washington
(BBC2, 10.05am, 29th December). As part of
the Growing Up with 4 season, which lasts for
two weeks, Channel 4 are showing Last
Tango in Paris (1 1.00pm, New Year's Day),
famous for its creative use of dairy products.
Finally, if, like me, you have not seen Shallow
Grave (C4, I 1.05pm, 27th December), now is
your chance.
1 quite expected Channel 5 to go for broke
with their Christmas scheduling given their
lacklustre performance to date, but sadly they
have not. The only possible success could be
Night Fever: Abba Special (7.00pm,
Christmas Day), but elsewhere it is just a tale
of woe. Whoever gave one hour to The Tim
Vine Christmas Present (7.00pm, Christmas
Eve) has clearly never seen this man's work.
T E L L Y
'Tim Vine offers his comic views on the sea-
son.' OK, that's filled 30 seconds, what about
the rest? Far, far worse must be Vannessa
Feltz's Day with Neil and Christine
Hamilton (8.00pm, 30 December). Has this
man not suffered enough? (No, Ed).
Elsewhere, things are looking much better.
The BBC has a full range of Christmas
Specials, featuring among others
Shooting Stars (BBC2, 9.00pm, 22
September), Harry Enfield & Christmas
Chums (BBC1, 10.15pm, Christmas
Eve), The Two Ronnies (BBC1, 2.15pm,
Christmas Day), One Foot in the Grave
(BBCI, 8.00pm, Christmas Day), Men
H Behaving Badly (BBC1, 10.20pm,
Christmas Day), They Think It's All Over
(BBC1, 11.05pm, Christmas Day),
Steptoe and Son (BBC2, 10.10pm,
Boxing Day) and The Armistice Party
Bucket (BBC2, 10.25pm, 2 January).
Some of you may have missed last
year's stunningly good Only Fools and
Horses, but fear not, since it is going to
be repeated on Fridays, the frist episode
being on 2 January at 7.55pm. ITV have
Dame Edna Kisses It Better (9.00pm,
Boxing Day), An Evening with Spike
** Milligan (10.00pm, New Year's Day) and
Frankie Howerd at His Tittermost
(12.45am, New Year's Day), which is
brilliant. Channel 4 has, of course, a
Rory Bremner Special (10.30pm, 30
December), preceded by a one-off comedy,
Mr White Goes to Westminster (9.00pm, 30
December) about an anti-sleaze MP. The cast
looks pretty good, so it's worth a look. Away
from comedy, there a host of good pro-
grammes. Not surprisingly, there are a few
Bond-related bits, including Nobody Does It
Better: The Music of James Bond (C4,
10.1 5pm, 28 December) and Shirley Bassey:
This is My Life (BBC1, 10.05pm, 2 January).
There is also a look at The Making of
Tomorrow Never Dies (ITV, 12.30pm, Boxing
Day), though past experience shows that such
programmes rarely do the film concerned jus-
tice.
Well, that's yer lot, boys and girls. All in all,
not a bad season's television, which should fill
in the gaps between sleeping and eating.
Have a good Christmas and, if you have
exams early in January, you have my sympa-
thy. Happy New Year.
