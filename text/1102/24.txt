INTRODUCING THE
WELFARE COMMITTEE
Hands up everyone who
knew we existed.
Well, if you didn't know
that there is a Union
Welfare Committee, you
do now.
The committee consists
of the Welfare-related
Union Officers, repre-
sentatives from each of
the Constituent College
Unions, the Union
Adviser, and the Sabbs.
We're the people in the
Union who are here
specifically to try to
ensure you make it
through your degree
alive and intact (that's
why I thought you might
like to know of our
existence).
Watch out for Welfare
Week next term, and
"Check Your Bits Day"
on February 14th... and I
hope you're all still
wearing your red ribbons
from World Aids Day.
We are contactable via
the Student Union Office
/ Constitutent College
Unions, so if you want to
speak to any of us -
come find us!
We are :
Anne Ovens
ICU Welfare Officer
Hannah Pearson
ICU Equal Opportunities
Officer
Lucy Jane Davis
ICU Women's Officer
(and RPMS Welfare rep)
Lloyd Kilford
ICU Accommodation

Selina Viganaya-Pavan

FANCY AN
ALL-NIGHTER ?
Ever spent the night with
49 other people at the
same time?
If this has been a bit of a
fantasy of yours, or if
you just like the sound of
it, we've got the perfect
excuse.
Join us in raising money
for Shelter (the National
Campaign for Homeless
People), and highlight-
ing the plight of the
homeless, in the spon-
sored "Sleep"-in on
Saturday 7th February
1998 (Saturday before
Accommodation Week).
If you're serious about
getting involved, sign up
in the ICU Clubs and
Societies Resource
Centre, and get all your
friends to sponsor you to
stay awake all night
(only blankets for
comfort and no Pro-Plus
allowed!) for a good
cause.
There are only 50 places
available (due to physi-
cal space restrictions), so
please, only sign up if
you're going to go
through with it.

The theme this year (with

A Welfare-themed Tuesday
night Quiz.
Exhibitions across the 4
main campuses.
Recommended Lists for
Letting Agents (not that
any could be bad !!)
The IC guide to London
Rent Prices
Information about other
areas of Welfare, from
your friendly Welfare
Committee.
And your chance to win
£50 in our HOUSE OF
HORROR competition...
We need your worst stories
about places you've lived
in during your time at Uni.
In Halls, flats or houses...
grumpy landlords, 'roach
infestations ceiling col-
lapse... any true stories past
or current are submissible.
We'd love to display pho-
tos if you have them, too.
Entries can be submitted
any time between now and
