Halloween Rally Report
In the early hours of the 6th
December, the country lanes
around Hatfield and Stevenage ec-
hoed to the sounds raw exhaust
notes as the C&G Motorclub
'Halloween Rally' took place. The
best attended rally in over a year
and a half was also the most disas-
trous.
Of the six entrants, two had
accidents. Myself and Brian Aldred
left the flew off the road and
dropped 4 foot into a ploughed
field. We escaped with minimal
damage to the car. Nick Collett and
Justin Folet fared less well, taking
out paving, contrete posts, a fence
and damaging a tree before parking
their MR2 across a ditch. A lifting
truck was called in to extricate
them.
The rally was stopped at half
way, and Hilary and Austin Jones
were declared winners. Once again
the winning formula was a slow
car, a female driver and competent
navigation. Big cars and big boys it
seems, make for big trouble. In an
event in which the principal chal-
lenge is navigation, treating the
night as an all out rally does not
pay. Still, we all need to learn,
don't we? And all who had acci-
dents are treating it as a growing
experience.
The next twelve-car rally seems
likely to be set on 6 February 1998,
around the same area. This rally
will be notable as it signals a new
era in the C&G Motorclub, as we
join forces with other clubs around
the south east to make for a fuller
entry list. Anyone interested in
doing 12 Car Rallies should mail
motor-club@ic.ac.uk or pop into
the C&G Union Office in Rm 340.

C&G v RCSRFC
Sparkes Cup
As predicted, we stuffed them. Yet
again the charging rhino of C&C
bulldozed their way to victory. But,
to be fair to the scientists, they put
up a great fight and the game was
played in an admirable spirit. Dave
'Jabba the Hut' Partridge showed
that despite his bulk he can in fact
be mobile and handling the ball
isn't that difficult after all. Tries
were scored by Nipples, Lionel,
jimbob and Chris 'who?' Dickinson
converted one of them. A fine
result. RCS may improve further
next year but I'm sure we can han-
dle them. Thanks to all who turned
up and please turn out next
Wednesday for a game. Sparkes
Cup here we come.

ICHC III v UCH I
Picture the scene. Early afternoon
on the plains of the Serengeti. The
sun beats downas naive, carefree
"UCH" gazelles graze, unaware of
their grizzly fate awiating them.
But what's this? Across the horizon
come the pride of the 1CU Hockey
Club 3rd team. Initially the wary
gazelles got a whiff of our scent
(especially Skank's socks) and
scored the first point in the
encounter by running for the near-
est watering hole.
The brave lions switched tac-
tics and attacked downwind as a
whole we pounced.
Our first goal went straight for
the jugular. Our second stripped
them of any skin and the 3rd one
ripped their hearts out.
ICHC III 4 - 2 UCH I
Wing Chun
Way of the Charitable Fist
On 30 of November, in the Great
Hall, the Wing Chun Academy put
on a charity show entitled
"Hazardous Encounters".
The perfor-
mance began
with our
teacher, Sifli
A n d r e w ,
going against
5 of the
senior instruc-
tors. After
being sent
hurtling in var-
ious direc-
tions across
the stage,
each in turn
a t t a c k e d
Andrew with a
real knife, a
broken bottle,
and, more
dangerously,
a baseball bat.
The assailants
were all of
course "dis-
armed" and
"neutralized",
compliments
of Andrew.
Then, the
"Wing Chun
Spice Girls", jay and Judith entered.
Both had to cope with the knife
attacks of Stephen. If anyone was
wondering why he was wearing all
the padding, our Spice Women
made it abundantly clear. One can
only hope that no mugger is unfor-
tunate enough to fall upon either of
these two lethal ladies... After
breaking tiles and free fighting on
the Wing Chun round table,
Andrew starred in the Grand Finale.
Currently the holder of the world
record for the number of times the
wooden man has been struck in
Tiles don't hit back" said Mr Lee. But
they're still bloody hard.
two minutes, Andrew performed
on the wooden man to the music
of Riverdance. Andrew has been
teaching at IC for 11 years, during
which he has put together many
shows and
charity events.
This show was
probably one
of the most
spontaneous,
with only 8
days of train-
ing before-
hand. It
attracted over
160 people,
most of whom
were friends
and family of
students in the
academy, and
£830 was
raised on the
night. Ml pro-
ceeds went
directly to
Whizz-Kidz, a
charity for
n o n - m o b i l e
children. On
the 13th of
F e b r u a r y ,
Andrew will
.take part in the
W h i z z - K i d z
Himalayan Challenge, raising
money for disabled children by
trekking through the Himalayas. He
has already pledged to raise
£3,000, which is the cost of an
electric wheelchair. If you are inter-
ested in helping out with the chari-
ty, or in joining the Wing Chun
Academy, please feel welcome to
come join us at training on
Wednesdays at 1:30, and Fridays
at 5:00 in the Union Gym.
Jiu Jitsu Japes
The recently formed Imperial
College Jiu Jitsu Club entered its
first competition last weekend
with some success. Sensei Nicola
Brown took a team of three com-
petitors of varying grade to the
two day national event held at the
National Indoor Arena in
Birmingham, where they won a
bronze and a silver medal.
These were the first awards
gained by the club which was
formed only at the beginning of
this term and accordingly are con-
sidered quite an achievement.
The club training times are
Thursday 7.30 to 9.30pm and
Sunday 4 to 6.30pm in the Union
gym. For further info e-mail
Matthew.Gibbin@ic.ac.uk.
