Thought for the Holiday
PART 1: CHRISTMAS
I used to love Christmas when I
was a child. As the weather turned
cold, myself and my sister would
stare, unblinking, out of the back of
the car on the way to school,
scouring the front rooms of
Liverpool in the hope of being the
first to spot the twinkle of a
Christmas tree. School would fin-
ish; carols were sung unanimously;
the blissful excitement would
mount, as the great day drew clos-
er. Christmas Eve was a nightmare,
and on occasion we had to be
drugged with whisky-spiked coffee,
just to get us to sleep. We would
wake up at six in the morning, tear
the wrapping from our presents,
and then proceed through gloating,
the my-presents-are-better-than-
yours phase, shouted arguments,
fighting and usually tears. Without
a doubt, the zenith of the tiny tot's
calendar. For our unfortunate and
harassed parents, however, the
day had not yet begun.
People say that the spirit of
Christmas deteriorates as one gets
older, but it is only recently that 1
have really begun to appreciate the
scale of the problem. Any parent
who claims that Christmas is worth
the gargantuan effort of proper cel-
ebration is one of two things: an
optimist, or a Prozac fancier.
With a bit of luck, it should be
the best part of a decade before I
am called upon to increase the
population of this Orb, and already
the costs of old Chrimbo are
threatening to outweigh the bene-
fits. (Such cynicism in one so
young...) People seem not to
understand that I don't have any
money any more. I got some dirty
looks last year when some people
opened their presents, even
though my bank balance was look-
ing quite anorexic. (An argument is
raging in Oxford, because there is a
faction who believe that the official
Dictionary definition of a student
should be "student (n.) a penniless
wretch." Personally, I'd agree.)
Merely getting out of bed earlier
than lunch time was also a serious
stumbling block. I managed to
wend my way over the road to the
champagne breakfast that some
friends were bravely staging, and
found my bacon charred beyond all
recognition, my eggs looking par-
ticularly sorry for themselves, and
the champagne... well, the buggers
drank it all before I got there.
Christmas trees always provide
endless hours of fun. They are evil;
just another of Mother Nature's
amusing anecdotes. I have been
known, in my role as a budding
designer, to waste hours decorat-
ing the tree; sticking myself with its
porcupine-sharp spines; falling
face-first into the branches whilst
trying to install the traditional fairy
and testing the lights above and
beyond British Standard
BS546546654654356765, to find
that they extinguish themselves
within five minutes of being draped
over the smegging shrub.
I would then come downstairs
in the morning to find that some
talentless
t a s t e -

monkey \ little children
h a d
completely
butchered it. "1
thought we'd try a
more minimalist
tree this year. It's
very fashionable,
you know.
Someone at IKEA
told me. You don't
mind, do you?"
The twenty-
fifth of December
does have a few
things to be said
in its favour. This
only applies to
the Christmas
dinner if you have
not endured
twelve hours of
culinary contor-
tion making it.
Preparing a turkey
requires surgical accuracy far in
advance of ICSM's very best, and
cooking it all is a piece of chemical
co-ordination never seen in the
Perkin organic lab. After these exer-
tions, I am tired, incapable of con-
versation (some might say an
improvement), and really not hun-
gry at all, preferring to sleep face
down in the gravy while everyone
else thoroughly enjoys themselves.
So the only redeeming feature
of Christmas, it seems, is the rea-
son for celebrating it in the first
place. A lot of Christians are likely
to be reaching for the Basildon
Bond at this point, so let me say
this; anyone who believes that the
real message of Christmas has
been lost in the modern age is
thoroughly deluded. No. It seems
to me that worship is the only part
of Christmas still worth having.
PART 2: N E W YEAR
If Christmas is the province of
children, then New Year is an
adult pursuit. If you can remem-
ber your first genuine New Year
party then you didn't celebrate it
properly. It is a very good job that
people don't start the New Year as
they mean to go on, for the simple
reason that they would then spend
the rest of the year in the gutter,
pondering the mysteries of life with
their own bodily fluids.
The perennial process is the
same. 'Where are we going this
year?" There then
follows a waterfall
of ideas; at first
credible, then
incredible, finally
fantastic, usually
culminating in
somebody wanti-
ng to sit in a field
of dung and break
the world record
for smoking hash.
Despite this for-
ward planning,
we usually end up
buying a ticket on
Christmas Eve for
the only club that
still has vacan-
cies.
There's usual-
ly a shopping trip
involved, too.
Last year, full of
enthusiasm, I
spent four hours
sauntering round
the city looking
for the greatest and most chic shirt
mankind has ever seen, rendering
me absolutely irresistible to whoev-
er I chose. In the end I went back
home and wore the shirt 1 bought
the year before. Yes, the one that is
banned in sixteen countries for
being a taste catastrophe.
Plans are currently afoot to
update car registrations twice
annually, rather than just in August,
to spread showrooms' business
more evenly throughout the year. It
requires only a small extension of
thought to realise that if nobody
drank on New Year, all the brew-
eries would call in the receiver.
New Year owes everything to a
measly two atoms of carbon, a
pathetic one of oxygen, and a
remarkably minimalistic six atoms
of hydrogen.
So the fun starts, usually in the
pub, and always far more early

than can really be considered sen-
sible. From here on in, things start
to go wrong. Step one is usually
someone forgetting their ticket for
the club. For the last two years it
has been me, and 1 have felt like a
right monkey, 1 can tell you. In a
cruel reworking of alphabetical
order, Club follows Pub, and every-
one realises that their "just one
more" strategy has led to their
blood streams being credited with
three pints, a rum and coke, and
six double vodkas, at some sadist's
insistence. Somebody is also usual-
ly asleep on the table, and by the
end of the evening, they are prob-
ably very glad. At least they will find
it quite easy to get home again.
Already a long way over the
legal limit, a taxi gets everyone into
town. Here, again, somebody
makes a serious error. Bar Ca Va?
Tequila for 80p a shot? Everybody
has heard of the European butter
mountains. Fewer people are
aware of the salt and lemon moun-
tains, which are dealt cheaply to
night clubs on the black market for
the New Year. This is why, after
four tequilas, my mouth now has
no lining, and the concept of taste
no longer has any meaning.
So we reach the club, tired and
already in a state where the bounc-
ers are unsure whether to let me in
or not; they think I am some sort of
lunatic as I search all my pockets
twice before I locate the more-
important-than-life-itself ticket. One
of us gets chucked out before we're
even inside. Everyone piles immedi-
ately into the toilet. We drink, we
dance, we make complete fools of
ourselves. A friend of mine tries to
chat up a table. The bar is a scrum,
but we drive with the strength of
prop forwards, even though we
have had quite enough already.
Then the moment arrives, and
suddenly everyone is my friend. I
chat to complete strangers like I
have known them all my life.
People like myself, who have come
to laugh, to celebrate; to have a
good time. All the misfortune of
the old year, all the bad times,
gone in an instant, as something
criminally cheesy shoots out of the
gargantuan loudspeakers.
And then... well, I can't really
remember very well. I have a vague
memory of...long blonde hair? A
girl called Emma?
Without a doubt, the greatest
night of the calendar. Merry
Christmas, kids, and I'll see you all
in the New Year. I'll have to get
home first, though...
