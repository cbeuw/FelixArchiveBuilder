continued from page one
that as many chances as possible
for competitive sport should be
presented to the students through
BUSA activities. She accepted that
single-entry is inevitable, but dual
entry was preferable until the
merger was fully established. The
medics felt BUSA recognises "the
sporting history of the Medical
Schools" and accept dual-entry
regardless of St. Mary's combined
status.
Eric Allsop presented the sin-
gle-entry proposal by suggesting
that IC needs to enter the best
possible teams in a nationwide
gle-entry would 'disenfranchise'
the medics, and could result in less
medical participation in IC sport,
dual-entry being appropriate. It
was announced that, by a twenty
to eighteen majority (two absten-
tions), the council had voted for
single-entry. The meeting closed
after the motion's formal accep-
tance, sparking an indignant exo-
dus of medics from the Union
Dining Hall.
Eric Allsop hoped that the deci-
sion would "build bridges". ICU's
worry is that the failure of ICSM to
merge with IC entirely on their own
terms will cause great division at a

sporting forum, and cited the
example of the joint IC-ICSM fenc-
ing team who became national
champions. He pointed out how
medical schools outside London
enter under their parent institutions
and claimed it was unlikely that
BUSA would allow a double entry.
The former president suggested
that the St. Mary's teams need not
be disbanded instead playing in
numerous other London and med-
ical competitions. This scheme
was ridiculed by medics for the
impossibility of its logistics. This
year the medics separated from
the team and consequently the
team was severely weakened, and
is now only ranked mid-league. It
was claimed that dual-entry could
only result in the suffering or even
loss of sporting teams at both insti-
tutions.
The debate raged for an hour
and numerous facets of the situa-
tion were explored. Andy Heeps
summed up by conceding that
current ICSM students would never
really be IC students and that sin-
time when each institute is careful-
ly identifying its role within the
newly combined college.
It was hoped that this meeting
would end a decade-old issue but
Ms Armstrong commented after-
wards "there should be a decision
made by college referendum".
Felix have heard she intends to
open the issue to a general vote by
IC students: This must first be sup-
ported by a 450-signature petition.
The IC Rugby Club held a meet-
ing for the IC players so they can
assess the club's view and then
confer with their St. Mary's coun-
terparts. If there is general dis-
agreement, it has been suggested
that a council Emergency General
Meeting will be called. This will
allow union members to vote for a
resolution that could usurp the
council's original decision.
Andy Heeps commented that
there were other mechanisms for
students to make their voices
heard.

Student Dies
ANDY SINHARAY
Staff and students alike have react-
ed with shock to the death of a
student in the department of
Chemistry, who is thought to have
committed suicide.
Dr. David Widdowson, Director
of Undergraduate Studies in the
Department of Chemistry, told
Felix that a report had been sub-
mitted to the Coroner. "He was
killed in a accident on the tube at
Putney...it's not officially suicide
until the coroner says so."
Describing the student as "a ninety
per center", said he had been "very
quiet and reserved, rather intense,
very studious... I think he was a bit
of a loner." He had just returned
from a year in industry, and
although his year, in the United
States, had not gone as intended.
Dr. Widdowson believes that this
"was a sympton, not a cause" of
the student's problems. "I think
he'd started to have a problem ear-
lier on., we'd thought he'd been
okay, [being] near the top of the
class...he was a very bright chap, it
was a shock for everyone." The
student, who is from abroad, died
when his parents were visiting him
in London.
Helen-Louise Windsor, a chem-
istry postgraduate and RCSU
President remembers the
deceased. "He was very very quiet.
I can't say I was a close friend of
his, I'm not sure if he had any close
friends - he kept himself to himself.
I remember speaking to him just
before the elections [and]...hearing
that he'd been having problems
with his year away. It affected me
quite a lot when he died." Dr.
David Hayward, Senior Tutor in the
Department of Chemistry, told
Felix, "I was shocked, and very sad
that it happened. He was one of
the brightest students in his year."
As Felix was going to press an
official inquest was believed to be
underway at Fulham Coroner's
Court.
