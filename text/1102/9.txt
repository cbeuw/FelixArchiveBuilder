BUSINESS
Hall drug busts are a regular event
at IC; the security team periodical-
ly catching some unfortunate who
has set off their smoke alarm or
turned up their stereo too far. To
the credit of the halls and the
College, a big deal is rarely made of
such incidents. But what business
is it of theirs at all? Hall residents
are essentially tenants (they cer-
tainly pay enough) and their room
is their home. Why, then, aren't
they treated as such? Southside
residents have to suffer cleaners
barging into their room at half-nine
every day with barely a knock. In
Linstead Hall, the cleaners have
been used as spies by the house-
keeper so that every minor misde-
meanor and transgression of the
'rules' can be dealt with in a suit-
ably humiliating way. Since last
week's fire alarm, security guards
have been patrolling the corridors
of Beit Hall several times a night.
1 firmly believe that people may
do whatever they please so long as
they don't bother anyone else in
the process. No part of college has
police powers; yet they are contin-
ually 'disciplining' students not
only for infringing college rules, but
also for perceived transgressions of
the law, whether genuine or not.
Many students use drugs on IC
property, and only a tiny fraction
are caught. It's about time resi-
dence staff and the security team
treated hall occupants with the
respect and privacy they deserve.
U - T O ?
Have you ever been to ULU? Do
you know where it is? Do you even
know what it stands for? No? Then
it won't mean much to you that
Imperial College Union spends
nearly £100,000 annually to allow
IC students access to it. Why?
What does it provide? The answer
is catering, discos, stationary sales,
a student newspaper, a swimming
pool and some shops. In short, the
University of London Union pro-
vides some of the services of ICU,
at considerable expense, several
miles from college. A bargain if 1
ever saw one.
HAPPY CHRISTMAS?
In these days of political correct-
ness, I have to tread carefully to
avoid sidelining minorities of one
type or another. As such, 1 am
going to take the bull by the horns
and address what I am sure is the
majority; Merry Atheists' day of
normality, and a happy new year!
