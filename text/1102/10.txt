10 COLUMNS 17 December 1997
I know that you all love
my in-depth dissections
of the burning issues
that face mankind, but this week
is so packed, I am forced to be
brief, which will make a nice
change. Normal service will be
resumed next year. My partner in
crime, Mr Common, penned a few
words on electoral reform, a sub-
ject which, as he said, is in the
news at the moment. Young Mr
Blair has charged Lord Jenkins, the
'veteran liberal' (obviously not the
Lord Jenkins who was Labour
Chancellor from 1967 - 70 and
split to form the SDP, Hamish),
with investigating alternatives.
Frankly, when it comes to voting
systems, 1 am of the opinion that
'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' No
system is perfect, but the great
merit of first-past-the-post is its
transparency. Proportional repre-
sentation inevitably lapses into
backroom deal-brokering, resulting
in the wholesale distortion of party
manifestoes with scant regard to
what people supported. Our sys-
tem is very old, untrendy and un-
'New Labour, New Britain', but it
has served us well. Most opposi-
tion to it seems to stem more from
disdain of those it elects rather
than the means of their victory.
Constitutional meddling is the last
refuge of the ideologically bank-
rupt and should be avoided with-
out good reason.
Roger Geffen enlightened and
entertained the masses with his
piece on the oil industry last week,
and 1 feel I should say something
by way of balance. Sir Ron is a
director of Shell,
serving on the
R e m u n e r a t i o n
and Succession
committee, for -
which he received
£21,391 last QQ
year. And why
not? It is benefi-
cial to have our £J
lords and masters ~ _
exposed to
organisations that L i
are run properly,
in the hope that a
little rubs off on the administrative
basket-case that is Sherfield. The
question about the behaviour of oil
companies in the Third World is a
little more complicated. Nigeria is
'governed' by an extremely dis-
tasteful military junta, which has
done nothing but damage the
interests of the country. This is
where the real problems lies. Shell
operate in a virtually lawless envi-
ronment, and this absence of reg-
ulation may lead them to overstep
the mark, encouraged by the
regime eager for the dollars that
stem form their activities. If Shell
protest too much, they run the risk
of having their assets nationalised,
as happened to BP in the Middle
East. The best way to improve the
situation is for the Nigerian people
to overthrow
i T p—1 their leaders,
v.,J s o m e t h i n g
' which we should
encourage as far
Oo as is possible.
• * • As you all
*5* know, I have
' V always been ful-
• some in my
S
l^J praise of College
•• Security. This
j l marvellous band
of men and
women gallantly protect us from
the preying hoards of SW7, and
also issue swipe cards, which
brings me to my point. Don't lose
them kids. It takes 10 days to get
a replacement and, were it not for
generosity of the boys and girls in
grey, I would have been in the
brown smelly stuff. Keep up the
good work. You can call the dogs
off now, thanks.
The integration of the medical
schools marches on relentlessly,
producing the odd casualty along
the way. This week saw the disap-
pearance of the Secretary to the
Imperial College School of
Medicine, Dr Julian Axe. The unfor-
tunately named medic has been
deemed unnecessary by our
chums in Sherfield. This College
ain't big enough for two
Secretaries, it would seem.
Commiserations to Dr Axe, as he
joins the very select group of peo-
ple rationalised in a merger that
should have seen hundreds seek-
ing alternative positions. While on
the subject of the merger, it is nice
to see that this year the BMS is
graced by some Christmas trees...
Finally, word reaches me of a
jamboree at Alexandra Palace
planned for this summer by the
Union. They want to know if you
think it's a goer. As you are all very
busy, let me speak for all College
members. Marvellous idea. Ally
Pally is a great venue, and it's
about time that we showed those
ULU chappies that little old
Imperial can organise a good bash.
Well, folks, that's yer lot. Have a
great Christmas, have a mince pie
on me as you watch Her Majesty,
and see you next year.
