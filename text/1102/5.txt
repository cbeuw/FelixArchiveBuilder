GET HOME
THIS CHRISTMAS
WITHOUT GETTING
STUFFED
Getting home for Christmas can stuff your finances, so if you haven't
already got one - and don't want to feel like a turkey - why not get a Young
Persons Railcard?
For just £18, you'll get a third off almost all rail fares. On top of that,
you'll also be entitled to money off stuff like C D s and pizzas. You can even
get two ferry tickets for the price of one (perfect if you fancy hopping across
the Channel next year for a spot of backpacking or to go to the World Cup).
Terms & Conditions If you are under 26 years of age, only your birth certificate, driving licence, passport, NHS medical card or 151C card will be accepted as proof of identification. (Please note
that your student identity card or NUS card will not be accepted as proof of age). If you are a full time student of any age at a recognised educational establishment, your ISIC card will be accepted.
If you do not have an ISIC card, the application form and one ot the photos must be signed and stamped by your tutor/head tutor/master/head of department/head teacher. Stations and Agents
accept cash, cheques, debit cards and postal orders. For full terms and conditions relating to the Young Persons Railcard pick up a leaflet at your local staffed train station or rail appointed Travel
Agent. For full details on the various offers available to current Young Persons Railcard holders pick up a Cheap Thrills leaflet at your local staffed rail station or rail appointed Travel Agent.
All you have to do is get down to your local staffed rail station with
two passport photos, valid ID and £18 and
fill out the form you will find there (see
below for ID and payment details).
You'll have a merrier Christmas - P^-
and a happier New Year - with the Young
Persons Railcard.
