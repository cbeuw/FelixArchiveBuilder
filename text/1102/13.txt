Politics was a different busi-
ness in the sixteenth century.
Then power lied in the hands
of the very much unelected
aristocracy and church
authorities, with king in con-
trol. Political opponents of
the king could well find their
heads on the block. One such
example was Cardinal Wolsey,
whose court was reputed to
be grander than Henry VIII's
itself. Wolsey was one of the
most influential men of the
time, until he fell out of
favour with the king, his time-
ly death probably saving him
from a more public and
humiliating one.
How interesting
then that our Lord
Chancellor, Lord
Irvine of Lairg,
decided to compare
himself with
Wolsey, as the
benevolent and
powerful lord, over-
seeing his fellow
colleagues' work.
This was an after-
dinner joke, but has
been taken aboard
by his 'fellow col-
leagues' as accu-
rately summing up
his behaviour. One Cabinet
Minister said "since May he
has been lording it, acting like
a medieval lord chancellor
who only has to report to King
Tony above everyone else". He
was taken in for a little chat
at Number 10, and was appar-
ently given a friendly ticking-
off. He has known the Prime
Minister for over twenty
years, so it was likely that it
would have been more 'tick-
ing-off and not a 'bollocking'.
One minister said "his wings
have been clipped a little.
There have been some infor-
mal complaints and I under-
stand Tony has had a friendly
word in his ear. Because of
their relationship, it won't be
a telling-off."
Some may now be wondering
what is the Lord Chancellor,
and what is he doing in the
Cabinet. The Lord Chancellor
is one of the oldest positions
in government, and he is
effectively the Speaker of the
House of Lords. A lawyer or
judge would usually hold the
post, which is on appointment
by the Prime Minister. As it is
always a peer, the position is
effectively unelected. He is
also the direct boss of the
Lord Chief justice (the senior
criminal judge) and the
Master of the Rolls (the
senior civil judge). Essentially
he runs the country's legal
system. Such an appointment
is abomination to those who
believe in the separation
between government and judi-
ciary. Practically all new con-
stitutions for countries enact
this separation, yet our sys-
tem keeps it. It has worked
for the meantime because
each holder of the post has
seen it as his duty to keep out
of the political limelight and
run his own department effec-
tively. It has meant that the
post is the linchpin between
the government and judiciary,
without one affecting the
other. Occasionally problems
arise, such as when a
Conservative Lord Chancellor
rebuked judges for ruling
against the Government,
something which they are per-
fectly entitled to do (it is inci-
dentally, almost impossible
to remove a judge - it requires
an Act of Parliament - this is
so that they can speak their
mind without fear of reprisal,
as is done in the US Supreme
Court, where judges can also
not be sacked).
The problem with Lord Irvine,
the present incumbent, is
partly due to his inexperience
in politics. Lord Simon, the
businessman parachuted into
a government position by the
Prime Minister, had similar
problems with not appreciat-
ing the subtler points of poli-
tics. One of Lairg's allies rec-
ommended to him that he
curb his "intimidating intel-
lect" and show "a little more
tact". "He is new to politics,
and is finding out that you
can sometimes achieve more
by taking people with you
than by being rude to them."
One might wonder if this was-
n't a fairly basic principle of
management, which one may
have picked up before reach-
ing one of the highest
appointments in the Land, but
never mind. Other examples
of either his ignorance or con-
tempt of the political reality
was his £650,000 refurbish-
ment of his own residence in
the Lords, the money coming
out of the generous pocket of
the taxpayer. Irvine's
response to public knowledge
of his £59,000 wallpapering
bill (part of the refurbish-
ment) was that "my succes-
sors and public will thank me
for this". This prompted a
Guardian columnist to print
his personal office phone
number, inviting readers to
congratulate him on his kind-
ness to us all. One of the sad-
der tales concerning Lairg,
where his past has very much
caught up with him, was his
present wife Alison, who left
her previous husband Donald
Dewar, the present Secretary
of State for Scotland, for him
in 1970. Mr Dewar never mar-
ried again, and the two men
have not spoken since.
I would not want to go into
too great a character assassi-
nation of someone I never
met, especially in my last col-
umn before Christmas, but
Irvine's behaviour is at best
good news for column inches.
With all the reform of
Government and Parliament
that Labour are intending to
introduce, a
position such as
that of Lord
Chancellor is
increasingly hard
to justify, even
though it has
served its pur-
pose well enough
so far (in the
same way as the
House of Lords).
We may treat
Irvine as an
intelligent but
politically naive
man,- whose
power is at least
constricted - he
knows he can never be given
any other Government portfo-
lio - and to give him credit his
performance in his job is
widely respected, but it also
known that he has received
his job because he was
already in the Lords and was
the Prime Minister's old
friend. He needs now to
demonstrate that he can be
more sensitive to his own col-
leagues' and the public's con-
cerns, for at the end of the
day we all employ him as Lord
Chancellor, not his old friend
Tony.
