CHRISTMAS SPECTACLE
So, folks, it's time for the big one.
It's Christmas, you've just had
exams, your folks are on at you,
no money, basically it's time to
chill out. And what better way than
by cooking the Big Pig Out as per
my stress-free directions. Ma and
Pa will be gob-smacked. I've
decided to do away with the
turkey business. Frankly, even if
prepared really well, turkey is dull.
It gums your mouth up and you
have to waste good booze wash-
ing it down. So I've gone for the
venison option. Sorry if I've
offended any turkey-philes out
there. Sorry. Not. However, most
of the trad trimmings are there as
well as kedgeree, a fishy brekky
dish. Here's the menu:
Kedgeree
Bisque aux Huitres
Quarter de Chevreuil Rod
Legumes Varies
Pouding de Noel
You will need these ingredients:
1 fully equipped kitchen
(i.e. an average real home
kitchen+minibar)
Kedgeree:
1 lb smoked haddock
«• l/4lb rice
2 hard-boiled eggs
Oyster soup:
<*" 1 dozen oysters, preferably
fresh
«' 2 pt fish stock
«• 1/4 pt cream
* 1/2 glass white wine
(shouldn't be too difficult to
find at this time of year)
Brandy butter:
«" 3oz butter
6oz icing sugar
1 tbl brandy
Main meal:
«" 1 haunch (leg and loin) of
venison
*• 2 lb potatoes
«" 2 lb Jerusalem artichokes
*" couple of onions
f 2 lb brussels sprouts
f a dozen mini-sausages
«" a dozen rashers of streaky
bacon
T the Christmas pudding you
made in September (you did-
n't? Better go and buy one, then)
And here is madness without
method:
The night before- Open the oys-
ters and add the liquid to the fish
stock. Bring the stock to a simmer,
cut the oysters in half and cover
with the cream. Melt loz butter in
a large pan, stir in 3 tbl of flour and
then slowly add the fish stock and
the glass of wine. Simmer for 1/2
hour, season and add a little
lemon juice and nutmeg. Remove
from the heat and stir in the
cream, oysters and an egg yolk.
Chill as quickly as possible.
Boil the haddock in just
enough milk to cover it. First bring
the milk to the boil, put the fish in
and then keep the milk just boiling
for 6-7 minutes. Drain and cool.
Cook the rice in the usual way.
Cool and place in fridge.
For the brandy butter, cream
the butter and sugar together
(basically mix them up and then
whisk with a fork until the mixture
goes pale). Work the brandy into
the mixture and store in the fridge.
Have a night-cap, go to bed
and dream of Santa.
On the Day 7am - Get up, have a
peek at the presents on the way to
the kitchen. Put the kettle on. For
the kedgeree, cut the whites of the
eggs into strips, crush the yolks
into a dry paste and flake the had-
dock into small pieces. Make
some tea and take a cup up to
everybody.
Melt 2oz butter in a large pan,
add the fish, rice, egg whites,
some salt, pepper and cayenne
pepper and til until hot. Get every-
body out of bed. Delicious odours
should help.
Put the kedgeree onto a warm
plate, pat it into a pyramid (well,
why not) and sprinkle the egg
yolks on top. Serve as hot as pos-
sible with lots of tea.
T- 4 hours -Heat the oven up to
350°F, 160°C, Gas Mark 4. Make a
stiff dough with about a mug full of
flour and some water. Brush the
joint with lots of butter or drip-
ping, spread the dough over it and
wrap with a large piece of grease-
proof paper.
Have a fag and a glass of sherry.
T-90 minutes - Warm up a
large pan of water (that has a large
lid to go with it), peel the spuds
and place them in the boiling
water for 10 minutes. Drain well,
season with plenty of salt, pepper
and herbs, sprinkle with oil, put
the lid on and give the pan a vig-
orous shake to "roughen" the
spuds.
Take the roast out of the oven,
remove the paper and dough,
sprinkle with a couple of table-
spoonfuls of flour, baste copious-
ly with hot butter, add the pota-
toes and onions to the baking tin
and put back in the oven.
T- 60 minutes - Time to start on
the sprouts. Remove any 'orrible
outer leaves and cut a cross on the
bottom of each stalk. Place in
some cold water containing 1/2
tsp of salt for every pint of water.
Leave them to soak for 10 min-
utes, no more.
T- 40 mins - Roll the sausages up
in the streaky bacon, skewering
each with one of those lovely
cocktail sticks to stop the bacon
unrolling. Pop them into the oven
in a separate dish.
T- 30 mins - Melt a large knob of
butter in a pan, put the sprouts in
and gently fry them over a low
heat. When the outer leaves are
browned, pour in about 1/2 inch of
water and 1/2 tsp of salt, bring to
the boil and simmer for around 10
minutes.
At the same time, heat up a
pan of salted water with a tbl of
vinegar. When this boils, put the
Jerusalem artichokes in and sim-
mer for 20 minutes
T- 10 mins - Heat up the oyster
soup as rapidly as possible with-
out bringing to the boil.
Blast off - Turn the oven off, drain
the brussels and artichokes. The
rest is waiter service which 1 know
nothing about so I won't bother.
By now you should have realised
that you have forgotten to steam
the pudding. Ah well eh? Better
stick it in the microwave.
Good Luck!
Antoine.
