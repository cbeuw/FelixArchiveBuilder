International
students
and part-time
working
Students from outside the
EEA (student visa holders)
must obtain permission
from a jobcentre/depart-
ment of employment office
before undertaking any
paid or unpaid work. The
Jobcentre will expect the
job to have been advertised
either (possibly in the job-
centre itself) before they
will consider your
application. They can only
give permission if they are
satisfied that there are no
people in the local labour
market who would be like-
ly to take the job if offered
to them. There are excep-
tions for post-graduate
students who wish to do
teaching or demonstration
work up to a maximum of
6 hours per week.
GAS
SAFETY
Carbon monoxide poison-
ing can be fatal. If you
have gas appliances in
your accommodation, your
landlord is legally required
to obtain a gas safety
certificate. If you have any
reason to suspect that your
appliances are unsafe, you
must get them inspected as
soon as possible.
If your landlord refuses to
arrange this, your local
Environmental health offi-
cer may be able to make
her/him. For further infor-
mation, contact the Health
and Safety Executive gas
safety line on 0800 300
363. Leaflets are available
in the Union reception.
SHOPPING
WARNING
Beware of bogus
'Auctions' held in shops
promising high value
electrical goods at
extremely cheap prices
(these usually spring up on
Oxford Street). What
usually happens is that the
auctioneer quickly
"auctions" a variety of
valuable goods but also
sells some cheaper items in
between.
Usually, the buyer hands
over his money to be given
a black bin liner containing
the cheaper item. Attempts
to get money refunded are
either ignored or can lead
to threats of violence. Also
beware of street sellers
(again, commonly on
Oxford and Regent Street)
selling cheap "stolen"
gold chains, cheap per-
fume, videos or CDs. All
are almost certain to be
fake. If I may roll out the
old cliche... if something
appears to be too good to
be true it probably is.
