ED SEXTON
Seven first year IC students were
caught smoking cannabis last
month by security guards. The
incident occurred on Wednesday
27 November in a room in Beit
Hall, where the students were
found to be in possession of a
small amount of the drug. Only
five of the students were actually
Beit Hall residents; the other two
students were apparently guests
from other halls.
All seven students have since
been individually interviewed by
Ken Weir, the head of College
Security, and are to go before a
Hall Tribunal today. Andy Heeps,
ICU President, will be present at
the hearing. The tribunal has the
power either to fine the students or
to expel them from their Halls. The
matter can also be referred to a
College Disciplinary, which has the
power to expel students from
College. This, however, seems
unlikely to happen in this case.
According to the statement
given to security by the students
said, there had been an impromptu
decision to buy the drugs, which
were worth about £10, and that
they had purchased them from the
Covent Garden area of the West
End. This has been the first college
offence any of the students
involved have committed.
The incident was apparently
reported to the police, who pre-
ferred to let College deal with the
matter internally.
In an unrelated incident, two
students were caught in similar cir-
cumstances in Linstead Hall last
week. It is not yet known what
action will be taken against them.

HIS SHELL
On Tuesday 9 December, Tim
Luca came to IC to talk to students
about career opportunities in
Shell. Mr Luca, who graduated
from Imperial College in 1979 with
Masters in Petroleum Engineering,
described Shell as the second
best-known brand name in the
world, with around 60 oil refiner-
ies. He admitted that pressure
from environmental groups has
been put on Shell, mentioning the
Towing Troll, which is the biggest
man-made structure ever to be
moved across the face of the
earth, and the Brent Spar. He also
talked about tensions between
Shell UK and Shell Germany. He
said that as a consequence of
European and American distrust of
Shell, they now talk to people and
ask for help in improving the brand
image. When questioned about
their activities in Nigeria, he called
the deaths "sad" and described
Nigeria as a "difficult working envi-
ronment". He blamed the Nigerian
Government for lines bursting and
oil spills, as they had cancelled
maintenance programmes for
being too expensive. The ultimate
resolution for the problems would
be for Shell to pull out, but he felt
that another company with lower
standards would take over, he
claimed
FIRE LEAVES STU-
DENTS C O L D
The residents of Beit Hall were
evacuated last week, after a note
stuck on a door was set alight.
Security evacuated the building
after the alarm went off in the
night, forcing students to huddle
in Beit Quad in their dressing
gowns. To further exacerbate the
situation, security guards then
refused to let anyone back into the
building until the culprit owned up.
After ten minutes of waiting out-
doors Rob Clarke, DP (FS^), used
his keys to allow the residents into
the Union Building. At this point
Security relented and the irate stu-
dents returned to the hall.
KING'S B E H E A D E D
The Union General Manager of
Kings College London (part of
London University) has been sus-
pended on full pay pending inves-
tigations into 'financial irregulari-
ties'. Tom Belton, Vice President
and editor of the KCLSU student
newspaper, Roar, apologised for
being "cagey" about the incident,
but told Felix that no other details
could be divulged until the enqiry
concludes.
SOAS SUCCESS
The occupation of the School of
Oriental and African Studies'
library by students (Felix 1101) has
ended. Protesters voted last
Tuesday to accept a deal which
promised over 500 more student
passes to the main Senate House
collection, giving a total of 1000
passes between 2500 students.
The vote was held in an emer-
gency general meeting of the stu-
dent union, and the deal was arbi-
trated by a representative from the
AUT, The aggreement also provid-
ed an amnesty for the protesters
and extended opening hours. The
committee also pledged to inves-
tigate further into the current sys-
tem of library passes.
Currently, each London
University college has to pay £70
to Senate House for every student
wishing to use the collection,
which although extensive, does
not contain many scientific texts.
Imperial College students wishing
to obtain a ticket should enquire in
the library.
M O R E BEER FOR
YOUR M O N E Y
Pub landlords could soon be
forced to serve a full pint of beer
and cider if a bill currently in
Parliament is successful. Under
the measure, oversize glasses with
a line marking a pint would
become standard. At present, bars
are only required to serve ninteen
fluid ounces of liquid (a pint is
twenty fluid ounces), after pres-
sure from brewers scuppered a
similar bill two years ago. The
Weights and Measures; Beer and
Cider bill will recieve its second
reading on 16 January.
