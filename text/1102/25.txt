Christmas is coming, the
goose is getting fat, it's the
season to be merry, etc..
It's that time of year again,
when there are lots of par-
ties to go to, lots of drinks
to be drunk, and a lot of
people get very merry.
Unfortunately lots of peo-
ple, especially at this time
of year, get too merry.
Drunk-driving incidents
always peak around
Christmas - no big surprise
why. OK, so a lot of
students don't get the
opportunity to drive, so it
doesn't matter if they're
getting more drunk, (and
more often) than usual.
Or does it? Christmas-time
is a great excuse to go out
and get beered-up, but how
often does anyone think
about the consequences?
OK, I know most of you
think you've heard it all
before, but in the hope of
making some of you think,
here goes again...
Drinking alcohol is a fun
thing to do and if you
choose not to drink too
much you should be safe,
and have a good time
(unless you get hurt by
someone else who has
been drinking too much).
But what happens if you do
drink too much? It isn't
really much of a surprise
that young people often
have their early (and
later!!) sexual experiences
when under the influence
of alcohol, nor that a lot of
pregnancies in young peo-
ple occur as a result of
having unprotected sex
whilst drunk. How many
young people wake up in
their first police cell with a
hangover? It's also really
important not to mix drink-
ing with other legal or ille-
gal drugs.
If you mix alcohol with
other depressant drugs you
risk falling into a coma.
Fun. If you are then sick in
your sleep you can choke
on your own vomit and die
of asphyxiation. Even
more fun. No, really.
Some other fun facts about
alcohol that you may or
may not know, but proba-
bly don't really think about
-Alcohol reaches the
BRAIN within 5 minutes
of being swallowed.
-Alcohol is a DEPRES-
SANT drug that slows
down the activity of the
brain - you only THINK
that you can study better
after a drink - it's an illu-
sion.
- Eating before drinking
slows down the rate at
which alcohol has its
effects.
- Fizzy drinks increase the
speed at which alcohol is
absorbed into the body.
-Alcohol affects women
more quickly than it does
men, and the effects last
longer, so don't go trying
to compete with the lads,
girls. It's not sensible, and
you'll probably regret it -
especially if you wake up
to find a particularly dodgy
specimen in your bed!
- The lighter your body
weight the greater the
effects of alcohol (part of
the reason why it affects
women more - the rest is
due to percentage of water
in the body - men have a
greater percentage which
dilutes the alcohol more).
- There is no safe limit for
drinking and driving.
Even at the legal limit,
young drivers are five
times more likely to have
an accident than non-
drinkers.
- Alcohol affects our sense
of right or wrong BEFORE
it affects our co-ordination
- think about that police
cell, or that moose you
pulled when you were off
your face last weekend.
- 18-24 year olds are the
heaviest drinkers in the
population.
- men who drink regular-
ly at unsafe levels risk
impotence and infertility.
(Although that might be a
good thing in some cases!)
- People often say that
alcohol makes them feel
sexy - members of the
opposite sex may disagree.
- Alcohol is loaded with
calories so it can make
you FAT. How sexy do
you feel with that huge
beer-belly?
- People who drink too
much in an evening may
sill be over the legal limit
for driving the next morn-
ing.
- It takes the liver one
hour to break down one
unit of alcohol.
- There are 2 'cures' for
hangovers:
1. TIME
2. Don't drink enough to
have one in the first place
A short quiz to help you
decide if your drinking is
becoming a problem
1. Do you drink because
you have problems? or to
face up to a stressful
situation?
2. Do you drink when you
get mad at other people,
your friends or parents?
3. Do you often prefer to
drink alone, rather than
with others?
4. Are you starting to get
low marks? Are you
skiving off college?
5. Do you ever try to stop
drinking, or drink less and
fail?
6. Have you begun to drink
in the morning before
college?
7. Do you gulp down your
drinks as if to satisfy a
great thirst?
8. Do you ever have black-
outs, or periods of time you
cannot account for when
drinking?
9. Do you avoid being hon-
est with others about your
drinking?
10. Do you ever get into
trouble when you are
drinking?
11. Do you often get drunk
when you drink, even if
you don't mean to?
12. Do you think it
admirable to be able to
hold your drink?
Your answers to these
questions are your own
business, but if you can
answer "yes" to any of
these questions, maybe it's
time you took a serious
look at what drink might
be doing to you.
Think about it - it's easy to
dismiss the effects of
alcohol by putting it in the
"it'll never happen to me"
category. But think about
that accident in the lab
after lunchtime drinking
(or the test you didn't do so
well in), the lectures
missed, exams failed, rela-
tionships broken and argu-
ments caused by the so-
called "sociability" of
alcohol.
OK, lecture over now -
Have a Merry Christmas
everyone, enjoy
yourselves, but try and be
sensible.
