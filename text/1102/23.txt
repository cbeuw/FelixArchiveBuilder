ICAFC brings about world peace
I C A F C V v R F H II ICAFC II v St Bart's I ICAFC IV v UCH II
IC Fifths are a match for any team
when they are playing at their best,
and today we were superb. IC had
5 corners in the first few minutes
but miserably failed to do anything
with them. Then, halfway through
the first half, IC won a free kick,
and pushed forward. The free kick
was taken and went straight to
RFH, who put it forward to their
attacker. With most of IC's
defence up for the free kick, the
attacker swept up the pitch, shim-
mied round our keeper and put the
ball in the back of the net. The sec-
ond half began with IC pushing for-
ward, and Simon ran himself
ragged and proved to be an inspi-
ration to the rest of the team.
Rapidly, IC's hard work culminated
in a goalmouth scramble where
Andy Mackey scored his first goal.
With the teams level, the pace was
stepped up again. Credit must go
to the defence for stopping the
RFH attackers in their tracks. When
Simon picked up a cross and pow-
ered it into RFH's net, IC knew
they could win this match. RFH's
lack of discipline showed through
with their frustration at the solid
defence and midfield and they
were gutted when the Referee
blew the final whistle.
ICAFC V 2 - 1 RFH II
The last game of 1997, and
defender Jesse's last game ever for
IC as he turns his back on the grey
of South Kensington for the grey of
Seattle. It was obvious from the
start that Bart's were compact and
had the committment to go in hard
for every challenge - this was not
going to be easy. With honours
even from the early exchanges, the
balance of the match was tipped in
our favour as a superb corner was
nearly headed through the net by
top scorer Pistol Pete. The game
was hard but dominated by an IC
team that looked, to the amaze-
ment of everyone, organized and
in control. There was little of the
usual panic under pressure that
has been our downfall thus far. Jag
fitted in seamlessly and tackled
with bite. The central defensive
partnership of Rob and Loz was
strong, at left-back "Big" Jesse
magnificent in his swansong game.
In the second half Pistol Pete and
Martin continued to cause prob-
lems and Patrick looked at home in
the centre of the park. Si D was
booked for the first time in his
career. There were a few scares
toward the end but yet again we
were rescued by the lightning reac-
tions of keeper Chris Barlow. The
match was sealed three minutes
from the end by debutant Simon.
Good luck Jesse!
It was a superb performance which
gave the Fourths another victory.
We are playing like the Accrington
Stanley team of 1891, adopting
the revolutionary 4-4-2 system.
From the offset we used our Alpine
downhill skills to bombard their
defence and it wasn't long before
Dazzler netted his first. Nice ball
from Perez. Another one of boring
Darren's one on ones put us two
up. Then Perez scored a tap in
from 25 yards. Special mention
should go to the defence- Andy
Swift, strong but delicate with his
balls spreading 'em wide, and Elliot
who played despite a bad case of
VD. Everyone was a lot stronger
than their opponents and we out-
battled them all, despite their
spoiling tactics. They scored a
good goal before half-time, but
that only improved our resolve.
Dave was nearly sent off, but man-
aged to escape with a booking.
We scored one last goal to make
the last ten minutes a formality,
Paul to Darren to Ryan and back to
Darren... GOAL and a hat-trick to
Daz. Splendid.

Gun Fun
Saturday saw the Rifle and Pistol
Club take its first visit to the great
outdoors for rifle shooting on the
Siberia Ranges at Bisley. Our mis-
sion: target rifle shooting at
200yds and "classic" service rifles
at 100 yds.
Everyone had the opportunity
to try out different rifles of various
vintages ranging from a .577" 1858
Naval pattern Enfield muzzle load-
ing percussion rifle to a modern
7.62mm aperture sighted target
rifle. The afternoon saw the com-
petitive element of the day take on
a festive flavour with some Snap
Shooting and a Turkey Shoot. The
Snap Shooting is done with the
classic service rifles and consisted
of 5 exposures. Top scorers were
Jacob Thome and Dan Carr. The
Turkey Shoot consisted of 3 shots
at a paper turkey. Best score was
posted by John McCartney and
Simon Parton. The aggregate best
score was by Dan Carr. Thanks
must go to Andrew Eldridge for his
unselfish efforts in coaching, and to
Nick for those boiled sweets but
unconvincing chat up line.
The last Wednesday of term will
see a novelty shoot for both rifle
and bow in the range, so drop in
and give it a go.

Editorial
So, cats and kittens, another term
of gorgeousness from the demi-
gods that are the IC sportsmen
and women. It is not without
regret that I have to inform you
that as of next term there will be
an as-yet unknown new sport-edi-
tor. I have finally bowed to the
pressures of work and the desire
to spend my Wednesday evenings
in Southside mesmerized by alco-
hol and pretty Welsh girls. Jake
has finally renounced the use of
his legs and has expressed a
desire to spend the rest of eterni-
ty in a fantasy world centred
around the cosy womb-substitute
of his bed.
The good news is that the
opportunity is there for a youthful
and ambitious newcomer to Felix
to take up the sport-editor's baton
and put in their leg in the great
journalistic realy. In the words of
Camelot "How big can our bonus-
es possibly be?" [Shurely "It could
be you?" - Jake]. No special talents
are needed (although a love of
poor quality puns is an advantage)
and full training will be given on
the DTP package used and you
may even be made the odd cup of
coffee/tea by the esteemed editor.
This is a chance to give something
back to the college and to shame-
lessly plug your favourite sport to
the detriment of all others. Anyone
at all interested should come into
the Felix office (it's in Beit Quad -
follow the sign) and say "I am
interested in being sports editor"
and you will be showered with
adulation and applause.
Merry Christmas each and every
one of you. Free Nelson Mandela!
Si and Jake.
