17 December 1997 LETTERS
deception and secrecy, maintaining
amongst most people the belief
that the church had a monopoly on
Biblical wisdom and truth, sustain-
ing this through the insistence that
Latin was the only possible lan-
guage in which one could read the
Scriptures. By persecuting the
"heretical" theologians and scien-
tists they were trying to maintain
the status quo to protect their own
interests (i.e. power and wealth),
God hardly had a look-in in their
considerations. The reformation
provided the impetus for many
changes, without which we would
not be able to study in the way that
we can now.
By ignoring the reformation,
Matteo Floris has failed to under-
stand the motivation of people like
Galileo. He believed in a Relational,
Creator God, a God of the "First
Cause", the proof he needed was
all around him in nature (it still is),
and in the Bible. Galileo therefore
didn't have to waste time asking
un-answerable questions, such as
"Why?", but could get on with
much more relevant questions such
as "How?". Today, as a Christian in
science I (and plenty of others)
believe that the answer to "why?" is
the same as it was 400 million
years ago, never mind just 400.
This means that I can study and ask
the "how?" questions based on the
certainty that God was there in the
beginning, that he is here now, and
that he will cotitinue to be there in
the future.

Dear Felix
Following the ICU Council
meeting on Tuesday night it is obvi-
ous that DP for Clubs and Societies
Charlie Joynt has gone against his
election manifesto, no longer
expressing support for dual entry to
BUSA. He has shown that he is not
a man of his word and I hereby,
and I stress that this is my person-
al opinion, call for him to resign.

ICUAFC First Team Captain
Dear Felix
I was disappointed yesterday at
IC Council (9 Dec), when the issue
of BUSA entry was discussed, to
discover the U-turn in Charlie
Joynt's (DP C&S) opinion of the
whole matter. Having sat through
the three ICU Hustings at St
Mary's, Charing Cross and South
Kensington to listen to Charlie
agreeing to back dual entry in to
BUSA I find it unbelievable that he
openly advocated single entry at
this council meeting. Had I, and I
imagine ICSM realised that he was,
in fact lying to us ( a common ploy
he must have picked up from past
ICU sabbatical presidents) I don't
believe he would have received any
of our votes.
He is a fortunate man that to be
removed from his position there
needs to be a two-thirds majority
vote at IC Council. If there was any
other way to remove Mr Joynt from
his position without going through
this farcical committee, 1 believe he
would soon be without a job. He
may at this point wish to reconsid-
er his position on the 1CU Exec.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,
The result that decided the 'sin-
gle-entry' policy in to BUSA was an
extremely tight one - by 20 to 18
with 2 abstentions ( basically exact-
ly 50% wanted to follow this
course) and now due to the deci-
sions of 20 people there will no
longer be medical teams playing at
Imperial from the start of the next
academic year.
The council is there to repre-
sent the views of all the students
at Imperial and yet midway through
the discussions one member of the
council was heard to comment
that, 'this is just another case of
medics wanting there own way'.
This was not about medics versus
non-medics, this was about making
sure that everyone at Imperial who
wants to play competitive sport,
against other universities, was able
to do so on a Wednesday after-
noon. Now whatever the great
emperor Eric Allsop (1 thought he
was no longer President) says
about this matter of numbers the
fact remains that there are now
twelve to fifteen teams of foot-
ballers, seven to eight teams of
rugby players, and about fourteen
teams of hockey players (men and
women) and yet Eric, in his ultimate
wisdom, is sure that all those who
don't get to play in the THREE
teams entering BUSA on a
Wednesday will get games else-
where. 1 for one will not be apply-
ing for the position of fixture secre-
tary in any of these clubs next year.
Sport at university is for every-
one, it is not just for the elite who
will bring so called good publicity to
the college and so push us further
up the league tables. 1 don't care if
we are not good enough to beat
Loughborough and Nottingham as
separate teams, but I do care that
everyone who wants to, from a
fourth team footballer at IC to a
third team netballer at St. Mary's,
gets the chance to play competi-
tive, inter-university sport at
Imperial. I find the fact that this
elitist proposal was put forward by
hardly the greatest sportsman ever
particularly galling.
As to the argument that it will
raise the standards, in most sports
this is just absolute crap, because
in most sports Imperial or Imperial
Medics are considerably better
than the other. For example the
standard of the first XV will not be
raised at all because not one single
non-medic will get in the team. On
the other hand, no squash player
from St Mary's, and possibly from
Charing Cross, will get in the
squash team at Imperial which is of
an extremely high standard. In
most cases it is like merging
Manchester United and Scunthorpe
and hoping for an increase in the
standard of play from the best
eleven players. It just isn't going to
happen.
To finish, I find it mildly ironic
that the lasting legacy of Eric
Allsop, who seemed to always push
for unity and co-operation between
the non-medics and medics at
Imperial, will be to create a divide
and level of animosity that hasn't
been seen since I arrived two and a
half years ago, and probably a long
time before that. And to all those
on council who believe
that this is 'one up' for
the non-medics, believe
me, we haven't even
started yet.
Yours
Oliver Warren, ICSM
REFERENDUM?
Dear Felix,
I writing to thank all the people
who attended ICU Council on Tues
9th December. It is refreshing to
see people taking an interest in 1CU
affairs.
The debate was a good one
with valid arguments on both sides,
which wasreflected in the voting.
However, I feel as this is such
important issuefor all Imperial
College students they should all
directly have a say in the decision.
This would be most appropriately
approached in the form of acollege
wide referandum. Most important-
ly this would give the sportsplayers
a chance to help decide their own
fate rather the a committe were
only approx. 30% had ever played a
BUSA match. Do you have any
comments?
Yours sincerely
Katie Armstrong
President, ICSM Students'
Union
