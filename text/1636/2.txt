T
he Imperial endowment
isn’t much of a secret,
and even to a Corbyn
sympathiser like me,
investing it seems like a sensible
thing to do with a huge pot of
cash – I mean, even I have an ISA,
although I don’t know what that
means or does. When we spent
hours going through Imperial’s
endowment funds this week, we
expected to see a standard number
of shady companies. Imperial has
links to arms, oil and nuclear firms
– we all know this. We have courses
sponsored by Shell, lecture theatres
brought to you by Rolls Royce, and
more BAE-bound graduates than,
well, than you’d hope.
Bombs, arguably, are quite bad. In
the 'right' hands, they’re excusable,
or at least a deterrent, and since we
pump so many students into the
arms industry, it’s unsurprising that
we pump a little cash into it too.But
considering our substantial research

into cancer treatment, investing
nearly £2.4 million in an industry
that thrives on the fact that their
product is addictive, with the added
benefit of killing its customers
slowly, seems truly perverse.
Ooh, FELIX supports a nanny
state! No, friends. I tried a menthol
once, you know (it was fucking
grim). People like cigarettes and the
tobacco industry sells them, so it’s a
safe place to invest. But just because
we can, does it mean we should?
Ethical investing is easily done these
days.If FELIX was able to find how
much each investment fund had bet
on the tobacco industry, presumably
it would be quite easy for the
endowment board at Imperial
(which is dedicated to deciding the
destination of these funds) to do the
same. £2.4 million is only a small
fraction of our entire fund, but what
if it's made up of your fees?
Pension funds, universities and
most recently the health insurer

AXA have divested from tobacco
products. It can be done. We should
expect better of our institution,
which prides itself on teaching
students logic,science and evidence-
based thinking, to stop funding the
tobacco industry with one arm and
attempting to cure lung cancer with
the other.
A letter complaining about the UK student loans company has gone viral
A
graduate who was
shocked to find his
student loan had
accumulated £1800
worth of interest just a year after
leaving university has written a
letter to his MP, which has now
gone viral.
Simon Crowther, who graduated
last year from Nottingham with a
degree in civil engineering, opened
a letter from the Student Loans
Company last weekend and was
amazed to find that his £40,000
debt from fees and maintenance
loans during his three year degree
had accrued £180 worth of interest
per month.
Crowther, who has started a social
media business since graduating,
said in the letter that him and his
friends had not known what they
were signing up for when they had
agreed to the loan repayments while Fair. Photo Credit: FELIX
they were still at school.
He compared the astronomical
interest rates, which have been
retroactively increased since the
2012 cohort signed their contracts
with the Student Loans Company,
to those of personal loans and
mortgages. Currently, the 3.9%
interest he and thousands of others
are paying is far higher than the
rates on standard personal loans or
mortgages.
In the letter, Crowther said that
he felt “cheated” and complained
that he and others students in his
year had “trusted the government
that the interest rate would remain
low – at around 0%-0.5%”.
However, even during his degree,
the interest was 3% plus inflation.
Students don’t have to start paying
back their loans until they start
earning over £21,000, but during
this time interest is being added
at 0.9%. Once you earn enough to
start repayments, the interest rate
can rise up to 3.9% if you’re earning
£41,000 or more.
Students who started university
before 2012,have their interest rates
set at 0.9% “until further notice”
according to the Student Loans
Company.
Last November, the government
announced that it would be freezing
the repayment threshold of £21,000
a year rather than increasing that
figure with inflation, meaning low
and middle earners will pay back
more. Martin Lewis, the founder
of moneysavingexpert.com, who
was on the government’s board for
student finance in 2011, announced
at the end of last year that he was
independently hiring a team of
lawyers to investigate these changes.
