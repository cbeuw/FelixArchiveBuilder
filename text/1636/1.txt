Imperial has £2.3 million invested
in tobacco firms via endowment
• Investments are indirect but clash with college’s cancer research
efforts
• Made indirectly via three equity funds
T
his week FELIX revealed
that the college has
significant investments
in several tobacco firms,
as part of its endowment portfolio.
Overall, Imperial has invested just
under £2.4 million across several
tobacco firms, via several equity and
hedge funds.
Our findings, made via a
Freedom of Information request,
show that although Imperial was
not investing directly in any tobacco
firms, three funds it was paying
significant amounts of money into
did have tobacco firms in their top
ten holdings.
This is somewhat surprising
considering Imperial’s long term
partnership with Cancer Research
UK,the college’s substantial research
department dedicated to lung cancer
and the fact that eighteen different
Imperial departments form part of
Imperial’s cancer network, aiming
to research and cure the disease.
The firms we’re indirectly
investing in include Imperial
Brands,who make Camel cigarettes,
British American, who produce
Lucky Strikes, and Philip Morris,
who manufacture the world’s most
smoked cigarette – Malboros.
Imperial is investing just over
£18 million across three investment
funds that have holdings in the
tobacco industry, and those are just
the ones who were open with where
their money goes. FELIX looked
at the percentage these funds were
investing in tobacco to work out
how much of our cash has gone to
the controversial corporations.

Imperial
gets 20% of
its research
money from
the EU
I
mperial receives just over 20%
of its research funding from
the EU, according to a report
by a research software firm.
Over the last ten years,the EU has
given Imperial grants in the region
of £342 million.
The research hints towards the
idea that if the public vote for Brexit
in June’s referendum, this funding
would be lost, leaving an annual £1
billion gap in British research.
It reports that 22 other London
institutions also benefit from EU
grants, with King’s getting 30%
of its funding from the EU, and
Greenwich 25%.
Digital Science’s report also
showed that the UK is the second-
biggest beneficiary of EU funding
for science, getting a quarter of its
funding from the union, amounting
to £967 million in funding last year
alone.This is about 16% of the EU’s
total research grant budget.
In the last decade, British research
facilities have received just over
£8 billion from the EU, coming in
second to Germany. Since 2009,
the UK has got back around 7%
of its EU subs from such funding.
The EU pays for 41% of the UK’s
publicly funded cancer research and
62% of its nanotechnology funding,
both of which have significant bases
at Imperial.
Unlike Germany, however, we
only spend 1.63% of our gross
domestic product on research,
whereas Germany...
