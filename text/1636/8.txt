The left vs the EU
A vote to remain in the EU is a vote for right-wing idealogies
Ben Sharpless

efore Obama’s recent tour
of the country (mainly
London, of course), I was
largely on the fence over
how I’d vote in the EU referendum.
Unfortunately for him however, he
didn’t manage to convince me to
vote to remain.Instead,his warnings
of being put at the back of the line
for neoliberal negations like TTIP
reinforced my left wing case against
the EU.
When we think about Brexit-
ers, we often think of xenophobic
individuals saying that they
remember how great the country
was before the European Union
whilst hoisting St. George’s Cross
up a flag pole. But what most on the
left don’t think about is the strong
left wing argument for leaving the
EU.
The EU is the antithesis of left-
wing politics and economics.
Spawned from the first emergence
of neoliberal politics of the 1970s
and 80s and coinciding with
Thatcherism in the UK, it is these
politics that still dominate EU
policy to this day, and act to mean
that it supports big business over
the real interests of the people of its
member states. A topical example
of this is the crisis of the UK steel
industry. While the EU does not
explicitly ban the nationalism of an
industry, it heavily implies that it is
not allowed, with governments not
allowed to invest in ventures that
would reduce competition in the
market and reduce the profits of
other businesses (even if it means
saving 40,000 jobs). This also poses
a problem to renationalising the
railways, an issue that has regained
a lot of support lately. Would state
ownership and operation of rail
services reduce competition in the
transport sector? Of course – but
hopefully to the benefit of those
that use it. And of course, we cannot
forget the ruthless imposition of
austerity policies on the Greek
economy.
When Obama told me I’d be
back of the line for neoliberal
trade agreements like TTIP (the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership, which is admittedly
coming under fire in many countries
but still being pushed for),I thought
“great, so be it”. While these are just
a few anecdotal examples, and of
course I’m not inferring that leaving
the EU would solve all of our
economic problems, I’ll be voting to
leave as I oppose the nature of the
EU’s ideologies.
An argument I often hear on the
leftisthatleavingtheEUwilltrigger,
or facilitate, a rise in xenophobic,
closed-borders nationalism. While I
do agree that this is a danger (there is
a big difference between patriotism
and unhealthy nationalism), the rise
of the right and far-right across
Europe scares me just as much.
Just this week, Austria narrowly
avoided a far-right president, with a
victory for the centre-left of 50.3%
to 49.7%. In Hungary, Denmark,
and even Sweden, the rise of the
right is reflective of the whole of
The EU is not perfect, but the better option
Leaving the EU will detriment the
UK, Europe, and the world

I
have written many times for
FELIX with trollish tones and
hyperbole, but this time, there
is no exaggeration in what I
say: I can think of no worse political
catastrophe in our time than the
UK leaving the European Union,
perhaps only rivalled by a Trump
presidency.
The upcoming referendum is of
enormous importance, and many
of you won’t be called to vote again
on anything that approaches the
same relevance. I hope that you
make the right decision, which is to
remain. Don’t think that it’s because
I am a grubby foreigner; I believe
in the European project, which
an 'out' vote would end. I want
to address some of the concerns
about membership of the EU, and
hopefully show you that, despite
these, a reaction of isolation is not
the correct answer.
First there is the issue of
immigration, which appears to be
the primary concern of Brexiteers.
Essentially, an independent UK
could stop unwanted refugees,
jobseekers and other undesirables
entering the country. I could
conflate this to racism, but it’s a
serious concern: is immigration
harmful? Won’t immigrants make it
harder for locals to find jobs?
Simply put, no. By and large,
immigration is beneficial for the
receiving country, mostly as a
source of cheaper labour. Will there
be cases of foreigners straight up
taking a job that could have gone
to a Briton? Yes, it will happen, but
we should not formulate policies
based on anecdotal evidence. These
events, while relevant for the
individual, do not represent what
happens on a macroeconomic level.
As immigrants arrive, the size of the
economy increases and everyone
benefits, even those initially
short-changed. To take a familiar
example, if an immigrant takes a
PhD scholarship at the expense
of an English researcher, it might
be bad for the latter, but foreign
talent and interest will create more
positions down the line, benefiting
future research. UK universities will
also profit more in publications and
contributions than if immigrants
had worked elsewhere.
If we claim to be a meritocratic
society, then we should evaluate
people on their capabilities rather
than their origin. A nationality
is not a merit, nor a fault. To
discriminate between workers based
on this metric risks being short-
sighted and self-limiting. Besides,
most new immigrants don’t come
from the EU, and Brexit wouldn’t
impact the ability to regulate it. On
the other hand,most companies and
economic studies agree that an open
immigration policy with regards to
the EU is beneficial for all.
The other big issue is the
bureaucracy of the EU, considered
by many as poorly democratic and
not transparent. But, for all its
faults, the EU is the most successful
supranational organisation of our
age: it has ensured collaboration
and peace between countries that
less than a century ago were fighting
each other. Some regulations will be
more beneficial for certain members,
and some will be confusing to the
layman,but is that any different from
any state? Some UK policies are
better for England than Scotland;
some benefit London over the rest.
Governing is a complicated process
which must balance millions of
conflicting interests. If the UK were
to leave to regulate itself better, why
stop there? Why can’t every county,
every town, every house become its
own state to regulate itself better? A
fractalisation of government would
divide for the sake of ephemeral
self-determination and would create
complexity.
The EU has flaws, but in order
to correct them we must remain
inside. To leave at this point would
mean to have no say in matters that
end up affecting us all. No country
is truly an island: now more than
ever, global events have far-reaching
consequences, and it is better to
have coordinated responses and
policies rather than many parties
each trying to safeguard their own
interests.The alternative is to return
to 28 different countries, with 28
different standards, 28 different sets
of laws, 28 currencies, 28 divided
Europe. And personally, that doesn’t
entice me. An interesting parallel is
the argument for devolution (the
handing of more powers to local
authorities) in this country. Many
people who support giving more
power to Cornwall or Manchester
because they can’t be governed in
the same way as the London or the
South East don’t support leaving
the EU.
Don’t get me wrong though, I do
think that the EU has some great
policies and initiatives, and I don’t
think it’s some malicious machine
out to get us all. Of course, being
STEM students, we can’t overlook
the benefits that Europe brings
us in terms of scientific funding
or collaboration. Freedom of

peoples.
This is what would occur if
the UK left: it would end the
European project. We would
return to a fractured continent,
weaker in international matters.
The Brexiteer's dream is that an
independent UK would prosper
once freed from the shackles of
immigration and bureaucracy, but
that’s nothing short of utopic. The
UK is small and unremarkable: it
has thrived so far not despite, but
due to being a part of Europe,taking
advantage of shared bargaining
and supranational regulations. The
19th
century is gone, and the days
of Empire are over. The world has
much changed and, according to
most professionals, an isolated UK
would find it impossible to re-
establish itself on its own today.
I won’t comment further on
economic aspects, because every
authority and expert says the UK
will be better off staying in, nor will
I dwell on the rhetoric of those who
advocate 'out'. Misunderstanding
immigration can lead to poor
policies, and the EU, despite its
bureaucracy, still represents the best
way forward for the UK.
This has been an unusually
restrained article for me. I set off
to write something more sarcastic,
but I don’t intend to insult anyone.
If you’re doubtful, you’re right to be.
It’s a complex issue whose outcome
will affect us for generations. I hope
that what I’ve said will answer your
concerns and perhaps nudge you
towards what, I feel, is the best
answer.
For a better UK, a better Europe,
a better world, the UK should stay.

movement is fantastic when going
through customs. And there are a
myriad of reasons, easily accessible
elsewhere, for staying in the EU
that I completely agree with. But I
don’t agree with Greek economist
Yannis Varoufakis (though he is
probably much more qualified than
me) when he says we should vote
to remain so that we can negotiate
and change the very nature of the
EU from within. Being only one
of 28 member states, and given the
amount of red tape and (primarily
Germany’s) resistance to change, I
just don’t see that as being possible.
If we could scrap the EU and start
again from scratch, a completely
new union, I would wholeheartedly
support this.
I know I’ve omitted a lot of
key points like workers’ rights,
the human rights act and trade
agreements, but the EU debate has
so many things to consider, and can
split those on the right or on the left.
On the left we should take a step
back, and look at the real left issues,
and not be (too) snobby about our
Brexit counterparts.
All in all, my main issue with this
is the nature of the referendum.
Do I want to stay in the EU, or be
governed by pure, unadulterated
Cameron and Osborne? Neither,
really.
