FILM
Documentary corner: Grey Gardens
E
dith Bouvier Beale, or
Little Edie, is a staunch
character. S-T-A-U-N-
C-H. She doesn’t weaken,
no matter what.That’s what she tells
directors Albert and David Maysles,
whose 1975 feature documentary
Grey Gardens captured Little Edie’s
spirit – once a young socialite on the
town, now living in a dilapidated
mansion in East Hampton, losing
her hair, and surrounded by cats.
Grey Gardens takes its name from
the house in which Little Edie lives
with her mother – Edith Ewing
Bouvier Beale, or Big Edie – but
really it is the two women, and their
dysfunctional relationship, which
lies at the heart of the film.
Pushing their unique, daring
brand of direct cinema, the Maysles
brothers first heard about the two
Edies in the early 1970s, when the
squalid conditions in the house were
brought to light – by the New York
Magazine no less. You see, Big Edie
was the aunt of Jacqueline Onassis,
the widow of JFK, and America’s
all-round sweetheart, making Little
Edie her cousin. But while Jackie O
was living a life of luxury, the Edies
had fallen from grace spectacularly.
Cooped up in the mansion with
innumerable cats and an infestation
of raccoons, the two women fight
and bicker, screeching at each
other in high-class New York
accents; their relationship is one of
complete dependence – despite all
their fighting, it is clear that neither
would last long without the other.
Both had dreams of stardom – Big
Edie with a singing career, Little
Edie with her dancing – but now
they are confined to showing off
to the Maysles, who are afforded a
privileged glance into their world.
Big Edie spends much of her time
in her bed, eating boiled corn and
pâté, so it’s Little Edie who eats up
the majority of screen-time. She’s
a true eccentric; coming out of the
house one morning, she talks the
brothers through her outfit:‘the best
thing is to wear pantyhose, under a
short skirt, and then you can pull
the stockings up over the pants, and
you can always take off the skirt
and use it as a cape…so I think this
is the best costume of the day…
mother wanted me to come out in
a kimono, so we had quite a fight’.
The whole film is shot through with
such moments, from her reading
her astrology book – ‘all I have to
do is find this Libra man’– to telling
us about her interests – ‘I only care
about three things: the Catholic
Church, swimming, and dancing’
– everything Little Edie says is a
complete gem.
But ultimately,Little Edie is much
much more than just a collection
of quotes and quirks wearing a
headscarf: she’s a living, breathing
person, one whose life has been
peppered with disappointment,
despondency, and unfulfilled
dreams. The Maysles treat her and
her mother with complete respect,
conferring the women a dignity
that the press would not offer them.
While some would call their work
exploitative, the softly-spoken
presences behind the camera are
so adept at letting us see the Edies’
world, allowing us to empathise
deeply with them, that the finished
result is one of admiration and
complete acceptance. So ensconced
are we in the Edies’world,that when
they invite a couple of outsiders in
for a birthday meal, it’s the regular
folk who end up looking strange.
Grey Gardens is a film for all those
who don’t fit in with society. For all
the Little Edies of the world. For all
the staunch characters.
