W
e do desperately
need new
antibiotics,” said
Dr. Andrew
Edwards, a lecturer at Imperial
College London and group leader
at the Medical Research Centre
for Molecular Bacteriology and
Infection. “What we have seen
recently is the emergence of some
strains [genetic variants of bacterial
species] resistant to all of our
different types of antibiotics,” he
added.
“One of the big problems with
antibiotics is that every time we
make a new one, then we select
for the bacteria that can survive in
its presence. Every time we make
a new antibiotic, very rapidly we
see resistance arising and that has
been happening since penicillin,”
commented Dr. Gwenan Knight, an
Imperial biomathematician looking
for patterns in drug-resistance
development and dissemination in
the community.
The concerns about antibiotic
resistance are nothing new –
would be much more catastrophic if
drastic changes are not implemented
soon.
The 18-month study forecasts
that by 2050, superbugs would be
responsible for 10 millions deaths
a year, the equivalent of one patient
every three seconds, overtaking the
death toll from cancer.
Accordingtothereport,thebiggest
contributors to antibiotic resistance
are the large-scale use of antibiotics
in animal breeding in a preventive
therapeutic action (including last-
resort antibiotics),the little incentive
for pharmaceutical companies to
develop new drugs and the lack of
accurate diagnostic tools for doctors
to pinpoint the source of infection
in patients. The latter leads to
antibiotics being prescribed against
infections that could stem from
viruses against which the drugs have
no effects.
Thereportistryingtoaddressthese
issues with a series of proposals for
future antibiotic development and
usage which, although welcomed,
might not act as straightforward
as expected. For example, while
it suggests to drastically restrict
antibiotic consumption in animal
breeding, according to Dr. Knight
“The Netherlands have been really
good at decreasing use of antibiotics
in agriculture, and they haven’t yet
seen the decrease in clinical drug
resistance in hospitals.”
Secondly, when it comes to the
economic burden and the financing
of R&D, the report suggests a
monetary injection of 40 billion
USD (approximately 27 billion
pounds) every decade. However,
the origin of the funding remains
a subject of debate Among the
solutions proposed, the most
controversial would be a tax on
pharmaceutical company revenues
to create a new pool of funding for
antibiotic research. This measure

or 107 hours Portugal ran
on renewable energy alone.
From the 7th
to the 11th
May
the country’s electricity
consumption was completely
covered by renewable sources. Data
analysis of national energy network
figures revealed this.The Portuguese
desire for clean energy was
encouraged by the EU’s renewable
targets for 2020 and the UK also
had their first ever week of coal-free
electricity two weeks ago.Oliver Joy,
a spokesman for the Wind Europe
trade association said: “The Iberian
peninsula is a great resource for
renewables and wind energy, not
just for the region but for the whole
of Europe.” So industry groups are
focusing on green energy’s export
potential. With the right policies in
place wind energy alone could meet
a quarter of Europe’s power needs
in the next 15 years. Inflexible and
polluting technologies are ending.
The time has come for clean,
renewable sources.
I
t is the 17th
March 2011 and
there is a distant humming
from the sky over the
Waziristan mountains, on
the border between Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Is it a bird? Is it a
plane? No, it is an unmanned aerial
vehicle (a drone to you and me) that
is about to fire three missiles into a
community meeting.
In this case the drone with its
laser-guided missile remained
faithful to its original military use,
killing 40 civilians in a misinformed
attempt to assassinate a Taliban
senior.
First entering the skies in the
late 1800s in balloon form, drones
have since been intensely researched
and developed by the U.S. army.
Nowadays these unmanned, aircraft
come in an array of shapes and sizes.
They are used to investigate hard-
to-reach places, such as the sheets
of ice on the Arctic Ocean, and
are pre-programmed to carry out a
mission or controlled by pilots on
the ground.
Their versatility is a result of the
on-board machinery that make
drones specific to their task. In an
Arctic ice mission for example, the
drone carries scientific instruments
such as cameras capable of detecting
visible and infrared light. This
allows scientists to see the structure
of disintegrating ice in areas where
it would otherwise be perilous
to tread. Military weapons and
climate scientists aside, drones
have found another friend: the
3-D printer. In February, Dr Mirko
Kovac and his team at Imperial
College London, together with
partners at Bath University, UCL
and the Dyson robotics lab, received
£3.4 million for a project involving
aerial construction-bots, this time
arming drones with 3-D printing
technology.
“These autonomous [self-
directing] vehicles that are able to
precisely deposit structural material
has already been criticized by
the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical industry, and might
evolve in a national tax on antibiotic
products instead. But both
suggestions are highly contested by
scientists.
“There’s two problems: firstly
pharmaceutical companies already
spend a small amount on antibiotic
discovery, so taxing them would
limit the amount of revenues they
have available,” commented Dr.
Edwards. “Secondly, because we
have a National Health Service,
taxing them [antibiotics] is just
going to cost the taxpayer more to
buy these drugs.”
The report is also proposing
as a measure the adoption of an
appropriate diagnosis prior to any
antibiotic prescription, by 2020 in
developed countries. The problem
is that such diagnostic tests do not
yet exist, or are not fast enough to
identify infections like meningitis
that develops extremely quickly.
The fight against superbugs is
extremely complex; there still
remain many unanswered questions
regarding the epidemiology
of antibiotic resistant bacteria
and many of the researchers at
Imperial are trying to tackle
them. For instance, as part of
the Antimicrobial Research
Collaborative, Dr. Edwards’
laboratory is trying to recycle
outdated antibiotics by remodelling
them with better efficiency and
countering existing drug resistance
mechanisms. He is also looking
into disabling superbugs’ natural
defences for the immune system
to clear out infections without the
help of antibiotics. Dr. Knight, in
an Imperial-based NIHR-funded
research unit, is trying to figure
out using mathematical models
the source of superbug infections.
She explained: “In England we use
about 80% of our antibiotics in the
community and 20% in hospitals,
but we don’t actually know where
most antibiotic resistance is being
generated.”
The alarming O’Neill report is
a source of controversy not only
within academia but also within
the business sector, but there is
one thing everyone agrees on: the
crisis is imminent and there is an
immediate need for global action on
rather than just national policies.“If

academics have been issuing
warnings for decades. However, a
new governmental report released
last week by Jim O’Neill, the
Commercial Secretary to the
Treasury,predicts that consequences

resistance just in the UK, it is going
to be introduced from somewhere
else around the world,” concluded
Dr. Knight.

Their
versatility
is a result
of the on-
board
machinery
from the air, could manufacture
buildings and repair infrastructure
elements.”says Dr Kovac,a specialist
in aerial robotics.
The process followed by these
“builder robots” is called Additive
Building Manufacturing (ABM)
where drones excrete materials to
build structures. In times of disaster
all sorts of obstructions can prevent
humans from accessing the damaged
region. Dr Kovac’s team are hopeful
that this new technology will allow
robots to fly into these areas and
print new buildings.
“The approach that we take to
developthesevehiclesisconceptually
inspired from nest-building animals
that build large structures using
collective behaviours”.
Thus thanks to scientists such
as Dr Kovac, military technology
is evolving. With the potential to
rebuild lives, it seems drones have
come a long way since the 17th
March 2011.
