industry.
These are just the funds that
were open with their holdings,
which many are not. From what
we could find, Imperial is directing
£2,384,327 of its endowment into
tobacco firms, though indirectly.
Considering the university has
strong connections to Cancer
Research UK, it’s bizarre to think
that Imperial college is betting on
the success of the tobacco industry.
The college has eighteen separate
departments that make up its
“cancer network”.
Should we divest?
Are investments in tobacco par
for the course these days? They’re a
firm favourite among UK investors:
Imperial brands gave their investors
a15%averagereturnoverthelastfive
years.However,trends are changing.
As the government changed its
rules on cigarette packaging this
week, AXA, the insurer, announced
that it would be selling its hefty
€184 million of shares in various
tobacco firms.The irony was not lost
on the firm, whose major business is
I
mperial’s investment portfolio
is a well-known part of the
college’s assets. Much like
a savings account, a board
decides where we invest year on
year, to make the most of our stacks
of cash and earn us interest. This
is done by most universities, and
whereas Oxford and Cambridge’s
endowments are in the billions, ours
are at a modest £201 million.
College calls the funds a “growing
source of unfettered funds for the
academic mission” but says the
assets are “not core to the academic
mission”. Essentially, no, this isn’t
money that can be used to put air
conditioning in the library or make
the labcoats in life sciences free. But
it may well be money from your fees.
Where’s the cash?
Imperial’s investments through its
endowment fund as of 31st
of March
2016 showed a few of the expected
culprits.
We own £1,047,744 of shares in
oil and gas giant Shell. Unethical,
potentially, but considering whole
modules on Imperial undergraduate
courses are sponsored by the firm,
hardly surprising. A slightly more
dubious firm we invest in is Rio
Tinto. The Norwegian government
divested from the mining firm in
2008, blaming it for causing “severe
environmental damage” around
an Indonesian mine. Imperial
have invested £155,560 in the
corporation.
Unsurprisingly, big pharma also
make an appearance, with the
college owning £2.7 million worth
of shares of Johnson & Johnson,
GSK and Eli Lilly and Company
altogether.
Also on the no-go list for the
Norwegian government is any
company that produces weapons
that under normal use could
“violate fundamental humanitarian
principles”, which basically means
nuclear weapons. The people in
charge of the Imperial money pot do
not feel the same way, and instead,
have a £847,596 stake in Lockheed
Martin, the company that makes
the UK’s nuclear weapons system,
Trident, as well as bog-standard
ballistic missiles and your standard
work-a-day bombs. Nice.
Tobacco and Imperial
Although not directly investing in
any tobacco firms, Imperial has its
largest investments in equity and
tracker funds, that invest millions
on the college’s behalf across a
multitude of mainly safe bets.
Imperial has £8,223,695 invested
in Fundsmith Equity, which counts
Imperial Brands (who make RizLa
papers, Camel cigarettes and Drum
tobacco amongst others) and
Philip Morris International (who
make Malboro – the most popular
cigarette brand in the world) in its
top ten most weighted holdings. Of
the college’s eight million, £817,435
is invested directly in tobacco firms
via this particular fund.
Of the £5,839,820 Imperial has
invested in the Capita Financial
Woodford Equity income,£422,219
is in Imperial Brands, £350,389
in British American Tobacco and
£204,977 in Reynolds American,
who make Pall Mall and Camel
cigarettes.
We’ve invested £3,988,005 in the
Invesco Perpetual High Income
fund, 15% of which was invested
in tobacco firms. This works out at
nearly six hundred grand’s worth of
our cash funding the cancer-causing

in offering health insurance – it was
funding the actions of companies
that cause the deaths of six million
people a year.
Ethical funds the world over
have been avoiding firms like
Philip Morris, Imperial Brands and
British American Tobacco for some
time, but AXA’s pull-out is thought
to be the first major European
institutional fund that has turned
away from less ethical causes.
In 2004, Edinburgh university
agreed to divest from tobacco, and
there are options to invest ethically.
Although these investments aren’t
direct, the funds’ holdings are made
public, so Imperial could quite
easily avoid tobacco investments. It
is only a drop in the ocean of our
huge endowment fund, though.
It’s not all sad news. Imperial’s
also invested over £800,000 in the
pet accessory chain Pets at Home.
The college’s £1,136,742
investment in McDonalds could
pay for a Fillet-O-Fish a day
throughout the month of June for
every student at Imperial.
