Imperial places 7th
in the Guardian’s league table
We’re up a place, but behind Loughborough and Durham
I
mperial has placed seventh in
the Guardian’s league table of
British universities, coming
behind Durham, Surrey and
Loughborough.
Imperial usually takes third place
in league tables of UK universities
but in this league table, St Andrews
comes straight in after Cambridge
and Oxford.
The Guardian’s league table
doesn’t factor research scores into
its rankings because, according to
them, “they are not important to
students”.
We’re up on last year, when we
took eighth place. Loughborough,
famous for sport, has swooped in
from eleventh to fourth place, joint
with Surrey.
The Guardian gives each university
a score out of 100, considering how

Corbyn, McCluskey and McDonnell were all at Imperial
L
ast Saturday, members of
the Labour party gathered
in the Sherfield great hall
to discuss the future of the
British economy.
The great hall, where exams have
been happening all week, was
transformed into a Labour love-in,
while party activists, journalists and
MPs wondered around the Sherfield
building discussing economic policy.
The event was a private one, with
Imperial renting out the space to
the party for a fee.
The focus of the day was firmly
on the economy; speakers discussed
Labour’s ‘new economics’ with a
focus on wealth and its distribution.
Jeremy Corbyn told activists that
wealth creation itself was not a
bad thing as “we all want greater
prosperity” but that there must be a
greater focus on how that wealth is
much money is spent per student,
employment prospects, student
staff ratio, entry demands and
student satisfaction, with several
of these factors extrapolated from
the National Student Survey. The
combination of these gave Imperial
a score of 84.4 out of 100.
Durham beat us by only half a
point to come in at sixth,and Surrey
and Loughborough (joint fourth)
both had scores of 85.
The Guardian’s data for Imperial
student satisfaction with both
teaching and the course was
relatively high, but our score for
satisfaction with feedback was very
low, at only 66.7 out of 100.
There was also a course-level
ranking of universities. In physics
and medicine we came eighth,
computing fourth, maths second,
and mechanical engineering first.
For Chemistry, the Guardian put as
way down in nineteenth place.
Jeremy Corbyn hosts economy event in Sherfield
created and shared.
John McDonnell, the shadow
chancellor, promised that Labour
would build 100,000 new council
houses a year if his party got into
power.
There was a general consensus
that Labour needed a better
reputation in economics if it wanted
to get into power again. McDonnell
said the party had to prove “it was
a responsible custodian of public
money.”
Many of the party’s big names
were not present, however. Veterans
like Gordon Brown, Yvette Cooper,
Liz Kendall, and Vince Cable were
down the road in Bloomsbury
at the Fabian Society’s summer
conference, also discussing the
party’s future.
In a speech at the end of the day,
Jeremy Corbyn concluded: “Today
we’ve discussed the state of the
economy. And the sad truth is… the
economy is in a bad state.”
He also said he would want a
future Labour government to “be
judged on an index of equality and
inequality”.
