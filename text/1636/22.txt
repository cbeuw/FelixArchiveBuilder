Minute trip to Taiwan
Felix visits BAO, the hip Taiwanese restaurant in SoHo
L
ast Wednesday was
another one of those
typical rainy, gloomy
days with me sitting,
staring into space in the back of
the Chem Eng library. I must have
appeared to be either half asleep, or
deep in thought pondering upon
the underlying philosophy of a
radiative heat transfer problem.
Hangry, more like. I was craving
something naughty, something
unique, something that tasted
like home. After five minutes of
followed by a confident march up
north from Piccadilly Circus, I
arrived at the simplistic exterior
painted a calming light grey,
expecting to see a queue so long
that it would question my reasoning
behind coming here in the first
place. Normally, especially during
weekends, the queue would start on
the street opposite and stretch far
around the corner. Wait. No queue?
I must have been dreaming.
Accepting my luck with gratitude
and joy, I walked in and was shown
to a seat by the clean, wooden bar
table. A one-page, A5 size menu
followed, highlighting all their
signature dishes with beautiful
artwork and also an old-school tick-
sheet for you to input the quantity
of each dish you desire.
The menu at their Soho site has
developed much more since their
street stall days. Nevertheless, it is
shortandsweet,easytoread,nofrills,
no fancy language and no hidden
costs. They still have a good range
of seven snacks, six types of Bao and
four sides. Everything dazzles and
is extremely tempting, despite some
items being more exotic than what
the normal Londoner is used to:
pig blood cake, trotter nuggets, kale
salad with salted egg. Don’t expect
one Bao to fill you up – it’s only the
size of a palm. And given the many
tempting choices here you wouldn’t
want to leave with just one in your
belly anyway. Think of their dishes
as tapas.
Drinks-wise, as their small,
flavourful dishes team up so
beautifully with a beer, especially
after a long day at work (in Chinese
we call them Xia Jiu Cai), a variety

BAO is
everything
I ever
needed in
life
desperate scrolling up and down my
Instagram feed, I got an answer.
BAO, created by Erchen Chang
and brother and sister Shing Tat
and Wai Ting Chung, started off
as a miniscule travelling street stall
with Street Feast and Kerb. Many
loyal customers, awards and baos
later,they secured a regular Saturday
trading spot at Netil Market, then
finally in 2015, transitioned into a
permanent site in Soho.
Despite being surrounded by
the fast changing food trend, they
stuck to their two signature dishes:
Gua Bao and their Taiwanese fried
chicken, called Xian Su Ji. If you’ve
never heard of a Gua Bao before,
it’s a popular Taiwanese snack
consisting of a thick slice of braised
pork belly sandwiched between a
folded, steamed bun.
Back to the story. After a high
speed powerwalk session from
college straight to South Kensington
Underground, an impatient four
stop journey on the Piccadilly line
of beers, ciders and sake are
available. If you are looking for an
authentic Taiwanese experience
for your tastebuds, go for a can of
Taiwan beer! Or go for a pot of
their Oolong tea.
All that research on Instagram
reduced my menu ticking activity
to less than ten seconds. I quickly
shoved the sheet to the waitress and
sat waiting with high hopes.
First off, the Classic Bao (£4).
The heavenly combination of the
pillowy soft, melt-in-the-mouth
steamed bun and the tender,
flavourful braised pork was finished
off with lashings of fragrant peanut
powder and coriander. Wipes are
available so feel free to dig in with
your hands.
Next up, the Fried Chicken Bao
(£5). A compromise for anyone
wanting to try the fried chicken
without having just plain fried
chicken. BAO’s fried chicken
is truly one-of-a-kind. A light,
crumbly, crunchy soy milk batter
encasing tender, juicy bitesize
pieces of chicken, seasoned with
mouthwatering spices. The addition
of the Sichuan mayonnaise and the
kimchi all sandwiched between a
black sesame bao is everything I
ever needed in life.
Out of curiosity, I went for a
portion of Pig Blood Cake (£3.50)
– a rectangular cousin of the British
black pudding and a common street
food not only in Taiwan, but also in
China and Korea. BAO’s version,
based on the Asian style blood
cake, comes mixed with glutinous
rice and fried until it’s crispy on the
outside, yet wonderfully moist and
chewy inside. As horrifying as this
may sound to some, it’s delicious
and you definitely can’t taste any
blood. Rich, savoury, and rounded
off by that gorgeous runny soy-
cured egg yolk.
A meal is never a meal without
dessert. The only dessert item
available is their fried Horlicks ice
cream Bao (£4). The fried bao is
slightly sweetened with a texture like
a brioche or a doughnut.A generous
scoop of their light, malty Horlicks
ice cream melts slowly between the
bao, forming a magical harmony
between contrasting temperatures
and textures.
Aside from my choices, other
popular items include the aged beef
rump cap, which is basically thin
slices of tender beef marinated in
soy sauce. For vegetarians, the spicy
fried daikon (radish) bao, sweet
potato chips and kale salad are
available.
I arrived hungry and left fully
satisfied, my taste buds swimming
in umami, without having broken
the bank. What’s led to BAO’s
success is simple, sincere, down-to-
earth, good food.
