ccording to the Leave
campaign, it is to the
tune of £350m a week
that the patriarchal
dictators in the EU extort our poor
impoverished island. As the great
cultural icons Boris and Nigel might
like to believe, if it were not for the
bloodsucking greed of the EU, each
and every British family up and
down the country would be wading
in the newfound riches of our
great free trade state. Of course the
numbers are wrong, but that would
make for a less punchy tagline.
Including Thatcher’s renegotiation
of the UK’s EU contribution in
1984, the British rebate drops the
actual sum to around £250m. But
even still, the whole idea of sending
away billions to the EU misses the

Why only a Remain vote on June 23rd
will benefit the future of British art
Maybe so, maybe not, whatever
the truth, anyone claiming that the
issue isn’t disastrously complicated
is probably lying. However, in one
area the EU is surely nothing but a
force for good – amongst the many
other EU spending receipts, there is
one stack devoted to supporting UK
arts and culture.
While the Arts Council remains

that over the 2014-2015 spending
period,175 UK cultural and creative
organisations benefitted from €39
million in Creative Europe funding
– the UK being the second biggest
beneficiary after Germany. From
projects on the artistic impact of
ceramics to the world renowned
Hay Festival, EU funding for the
arts is diverse and differentiating.
On a wider stage, many recent
highlights in British cinema have
come with the assistance of EU
funding including the likes of The
King’s Speech, Slumdog Millionaire
and this year’s Palme d’Or winner
I, Daniel Blake. While many might
moan at thousands being spent on
niche art projects, the preservation
point – the majority of that sum is
sent back in all the different shapes
and sizes of EU spending in the UK.

and advancement of culture will
always come in forms that are not
to everyone’s taste. Equally, while
some might argue that this degree
of arts funding could be matched if
we left the EU, the past six years of
reduced government spending on
culture suggests that this is unlikely.
But the EU’s contribution to UK
arts is more than just the Creative
Europe funding. A number of
cultural institutions have benefited
from the work of the European
Regional Development Fund and
programmes including Erasmus
and Interreg make substantial
investments in British creative
institutions.
To satisfy those most interested in
the economic argument, it is worth
remembering that the EU’s position
as the UK’s largest trading partner
also applies to the creative industries.
For every £1 invested in the creative
industries, an additional £2.01 is

generated in the wider economy.
With the arts contributing a total of
£7.7 billion to the UK economy in
2011, the sector is thriving despite
artistically. With reports showing
a £750 million boost to Liverpool’s
economy and a 10% rise in visitation
numbers at museums and galleries,
the economic benefits of the UK
seem clear. Unfortunately, with the
UK being only one small part of the
wider EU community, we need to
wait until 2023 for the European
Capital of Culture to return to the
UK where Leeds and Dundee have
been cited as hopefuls, but in the
meantime, it is worth remembering
that the EU project is as much
about cultural unity as it is about
economic prosperity.
Increasingly, the work of artists
is becoming less bound by the

recent cuts. As is always the case,
some groups have complained
about EU regulation on the export
of cultural goods. However, the
fact that Europe’s cultural heritage
cannot be sold by Christies to the
Middle East and Asia is probably a
good thing.
One clear example of the EU’s
benefit is through initiatives such
as the European Capital of Culture.

traditional geographic borders and
international collaboration has
become the norm. From the point
of view of the artists themselves
the prospect of Brexit has been
described as a “huge creative step
backwards” and “artistic isolation.”
Only last week, 282 of the leading
Industries Federation being recently
polled, a huge 96% responded as
being in favour of remaining in the
EU. With over 2.6 million people
employed in the creative economy,
it would be naïve to think that
leaving the EU would not harm
our creative output. Of course, as
the Mail Online said so eloquently,
the creative industries are filled with
“desperate left-wing luvvies,” so it
is no wonder that there is strong
support for the EU, but that should
not negate the powerful voice of this
influential community.
In the end, I anticipate that the
arts will be a quiet bystander in
the final arguments for staying or
leaving the EU. With much of the
Leave campaign’s argument focused
around anti-immigration bigotry,
you could easily vote for staying
in the EU on purely moral reasons
without worrying about the arts.
However, in this time of European
division and the rise of radical
anti-EU parties on the continent,
maybe it is the role of art to remind
everyone of the importance of
this cultural union. The EU is far
from perfect, and there are many
legitimate reasons one might want
to leave, but doing so without long
term harm across different sectors
and especially in the arts is not
going to happen.

While the financial benefit for
creatives at the top is clear, many
smaller, less influential artists show
equally strong support for the EU.
