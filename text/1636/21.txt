This week you realise how far
behind you are on Game of
Thrones but you don’t even
care anymore. The thing
happens to that guy but then
FUCK that other guy comes
to the place with the other
woman and then they have
sex. Btw, spoilers.

This week you're Samantha
Cameron and your husband's
decided to buy you a second
hand Nissan Micra for
£1500,presumably in a bid to
look more like the "common
man". Like a 17-year-old lad
you use it to cruise round
the estate, your own country
estate that is.
This week, you dress up as
an air conditioning unit
and round up everyone in
the library, getting them to
bring hot water bottles, gas
heaters and small camping
stoves to the blue cube, so
they know how it feels. Your
sweaty army finds out there's
free coffee there and so
permanently relocates.
This week you shave your
head just to shake it up a bit;
however, during a revision
session in the library your
stretching gets interpreted
as a Nazi salute and you
are kicked out of Imperial.
At least you're a decent
temperature in the library.
This week you start a petition
to get the central library air
conditioning and Imperial
actually listen to the students
and then do something they
want! You then wake up
from that dream and realise
Imperial doesn’t care about
its students.
This week you find out that
your roommate is actually a
communist sleeper spy and
that the mention of Ukraine
causes him to tense up.
Still doesn’t explain why he
masturbates without locking
the door though.
This week you wonder if that
guy ever leaves the library –
you know the one with the
dragon ball z hair who always
wears a vest. I’ve legit seen
him with a towel so he could
just wash in Ethos. Gross.
This week you remember
how fucking ridiculous it is to
find a house in London.Fuck
my life, fuck estate agents,
landlords, EDF energy,
Zoopla, and Boris Johnson. I
hate this city.
This week to procrastinate
you decide to go on a
YouTube binge but you
end up going down a hole
where you find yourself in
5am looking at tutorials
for peeling watermelons.
Probably time to do some
revision.
This week eduroam shuts
down just as you are preparing
for that revision-break wank,
leaving you stuck with just
the tabs you had open. All
that is left is your 60-year-old
process dynamics lecturer.
Well sometimes you've got to
work with what you have.
This week Imperial focusses
on the fact that we are
number three in the UK
for innovation and research
bollocks but once again in the
polls about the actual student
experience we are lacking
severely – it's fucking horrible
here, am I right?
This week you're Dale
Winton and you come out as
pro Donald Trump. You got
chatting at a tanning salon
and found you have a lot in
common, chiefly your joint
catchphrase of "Bring on the
wall!"
