David Nutt talks drugs,alcohol and research funding

D
avid Nutt, the chair of
Imperial’s Centre for
Neuropsychopharmacol-
ogy, advocate for drug
reform, and former chair of the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of
Drugs before he was sacked by the
government in 2009 for saying al-
cohol was more harmful than illegal
drugs, spoke to students and staff
last week as part of Imperial’s men-
tal health week.
His talk, which was the week’s
keynote lecture,was entitled‘Mental
illness and illegal drugs: cause or
cure?’ and covered everything from
the death of Amy Winehouse to the
political motives behind Richard
Nixon’s war on narcotics.
Before he was asked to step down
as the government’s chief advisor
on drug policy, David Nutt said
some pretty controversial things
about drugs, the most famous being
when he compared the number of
annual deaths linked to horseriding
(100) to those linked to ecstasy
(30). Thereafter, his research-based
statements clashed more and more
with the government’s political
stance before he was finally let go
after publishing a paper ranking
drugs,both legal and illegal,in order
of harm. Alcohol and tobacco were
above cannabis, LSD and ecstasy.
At his talk last Thursday, Professor
Nutt discussed the dangers of

Nominations for DPFS to reopen next week
The fifth sabb will return next year
A
fter rumours of the
position’s demise, the
union has re-opened
nominations for the role
of Deputy President (Finance and
Services).
Despite a huge number of students
running for the roles of President
and Deputy President (Welfare)
this year, no one stood to replace
Chris Kaye as DPFS.
At one point, there was talk of
replacing the DPFS role with
a sports sabb or some kind of
student development sabbatical
role. However, these changes would
have had to have been approved
by union council, the governing
body of the union made up solely
of students and sabbs. With union
council struggling with quoracy
issues all year, this would have been
impossible to pass in such a short
space of time.
If no one stands for the position
this year, it’ll be the perfect

...dedicates 2.85%, suggesting
that we are more heavily relying on
this EU funding than they are.
Regardless of your political
leanings, it’s obvious from the
paper that the UK has become
pretty dependent on EU funding.
Scientists for Britain, the Brexit
campaign group, says that countries
outside the EU, like Israel, Norway
and Iceland still receive science
funding from the union, and that
the nordic countries actually have
the greatest funding per capita from
the EU commission’s £61 billion
‘Horizon 2020’research programme.
The battle for hearts and minds
continue across Imperial continues
this week, as ‘Students for Britain’,
the Brexit campaign group, started
to distribute their leaflets across
campus.
The union is hosting an EU debate
on the 2nd
of June in Skempton LT
164, and the referendum is on the
23rd
of June. You can register to vote
until the 7th
of June.

opportunity to ditch the role that
many have wanted to get rid of for
a while.
The DPFS role includes approving
clubs’ claims, and generally looking
after the union’s spending.Arguably,
it’s a good idea to have a student
keep an eye on financial matters,

rather than leave it to the President
who has other concerns.
If you’re interested in running,
the position pays a sweet £19,000
a year, plus a free place in halls or
a significant contribution if you
choose to rent a property.
Nominations reopen next Tuesday
the 31st
of May and close on the 9th
of June. Candidates are then free
to campaign, and voting last from
June the 13th
to the 17th
. Results
will be announced online (no glitter
cannons this time) on Monday the
20th
.
Other unfilled positions that
nominations have been reopened
for include BME, Disabilities and
Gender Equality Officers, as well
as two ICSMSU positions and the
whole Graduate Students’ Union
committee.
Chris Kaye, the current DPFS,
who recently had a union bar
cocktail named after him, said
he was “delighted” at the news,
telling FELIX “the second oldest
sabbatical role in the Union plays
an important part to ensure the
best possible service standards for
our students” and has a “strong
input into direction of the Union,
as well as to solve problems for our
members”.

He
discussed
the dangers
of alcohol
and its
accepted
danger to
public health
alcohol and its toxic, yet accepted,
danger to public health. He spoke
solemnly on Amy Winehouse’s
death, discussing the media’s
portrayal of her heroin addiction,
in comparison to the relapse into
alcohol addiction that actually
killed her. Despite being sober for
six weeks, which the government
defines as being ‘cured’, it was a
bottle of vodka combined with an
abstinence-induced low tolerance
that killed her.
David Nutt pressed the danger of
alcohol, telling the audience that it
was now the leading cause of death
in men in the UK today, and would
soon be the same for women.
However, politically, alcohol is
accepted and enjoyed by policy-
makers and journalists, which he
suggested was a motive behind the
government’s preferential treatment
of alcohol to other illegal drugs that
do less harm overall.
Obviously, as an advocate for
drug reform, David Nutt mourned
the seemingly non-research based
rhetoric behind the government’s
current drug laws.Not only do these
laws unfairly penalise people of
colour, they make his research into
using drugs like LSD, mushrooms
and MDMA to treat a range of
psychiatric disorders, all the harder
to do. Getting research like this past
ethics committees, and therefore
securing funding, sound like a
nightmare.
This is what led to David Nutt to
collaborate with Channel 4 to make
the Drugs Live programmes, which
as well as giving us the amazing
footage of Channel 4 newsreader
Jon Snow stoned in an MRI
machine, also gave Nutt and his
co-researchers the funding to do a
brain imaging study on patients on
MDMA.
The new psychoactive substances
law that comes into effect at the
end of this month did not escape a
mention, although Professor Nutt
did not take a favourable stance
on the legal highs, such as spice,
that this new law is attempting to
clamp down on. Spice is a synthetic
cannabis that’s now widespread
in prisons. Originally created as a
medicine but deemed too toxic for
use, it’s risen in popularity in the
prison system since it is difficult
to detect in both drug tests and by
smell. However, it is by no means
preferable to cannabis use, as it’s far
more potent and, more importantly
for public health, we know much
less about it.
David Nutt’s pragmatism when
it comes to drugs is obvious when
he speaks. He speaks on the
subject with all the authority and
frustration that you might expect
from someone who’s attempted to
work with the government when it
comes to drug policy. The evidence
is obvious to him, and by the end of
the talk it seems obvious to you too:
wanting drastic new drug policy is
no longer the standpoint of stoners
and lib dems – it may well be the
best way forward for public health
in this country.
That amounts to £342 million
over the last decade
