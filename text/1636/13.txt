Escaping the uncanny valley
Cale Tilford
Music and Games Editor
Uncharted 4 sets the course for the future of gaming realism
A
major criticism of the
Uncharted trilogy
has always been that
it is more style than
substance, that is focuses too heavily
on glorious set-pieces and stunning
scenery to mask its flaws.That is not
to say that these games don’t have
substantial playable elements – they
do – but the gameplay that does
exist is often shallow and poor when
compared to the genres it borrows
from. The gameplay element most
criticised in previous titles was the
third-person gunplay. Imperfect
controls plagued these repetitive
sections which make up a large part
of the Uncharted series.Many would
argue (myself included) that the
games would be better if shooting
were removed completely. A few
years after the release of Uncharted
3, Naughty Dog released The Last
of Us, which fixed many of these
issues. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End
relies heavily on the improvements
that made The Last of Us a critical
success. It’s more serious in tone,
relies less on set-pieces, and feels
more natural (in all of its gameplay
mechanics). This is easily the best
game Naughty Dog have ever made,
the best game on the PS4, and a
historic moment in video game
history. It is the first game that truly
moves beyond the uncanny valley
are able to render interactive
environments – in their own
home – in such detail. Uncharted
4 transports us to bright green
jungles where each tree, branch,
and leaf sways effortlessly in the
wind. Drake and his companions
travel to ancient cities in decay and
lively modern tourist destinations.

into astonishing realism.
Photorealism has been a goal since
the dawn of video games.In the past
the limits of technology resulted in
artists making stylistic choices to
create attractive games regardless,
while some rejected (and continue
to reject) photorealism altogether.
It is only now with the sheer power
of modern consoles that consumers
the world that they have created,
the sea is nearly always in view.
It’s rare for the player to ever feel
enclosed (unless they’re in a cave,
obviously) or constrained. The
game might be linear, but it feels
like an ‘open’ world. Naughty Dog
These spectacular graphics are the
result of more than just detailed
geometry and textures; developers
Naughty Dog showcase some of
the industry’s best lighting effects.
It is this aspect of its graphics that
makes the game truly stand apart
from its predecessors (and even the
recent Uncharted trilogy collection
released on PS4). The game not
only takes place in many locations,
but in a variety of different lighting
conditions. Some chapters play
out completely at night (or day),
while others take place entirely in
underground caverns. The light that
brings visibility to these areas –
whether it be a lighter,torch or flame
– also creates incredibly realistic
shadows. A frequent sense of
claustrophobia is the result of these
technologies; as much as Uncharted
has always been about exploring and
being out in the open it has often
contrasted this with the fear of
being trapped in ancient tombs and
structures. With much of the game
taking place near, or on, the water,
Naughty Dog have ensured these
bodies of liquid look gorgeous and
react to external forces in the way
you would expect. Frequent close-
ups of Nathan Drake’s glistening

forehead only affirm the excellence
of the technology on display.
The other aspect of Uncharted 4’s
presentation that deserves praise
is its animation. Playing as Drake
you feel like you inhabit a physical
space, as his body reacts to crowds
(similar to the Assassin’s Creed
series), action, and environmental
destruction. Even more impressive
is the utilisation of facial capture
to animate the faces of the games
not known for the quality of their
scripts, and the supposed final game
is not much of an exception. For a
game that glosses over unnecessary
death, it is surprising that the script
has so many reflective moments.
These are mainly conversations
between Nathan Drake and
his wife Elena, examining their
relationship and questioning the
actions that cause the game’s major
conflicts. Naughty Dog also play
with narrative and structure with
one chapter in particular being a
great (and surprising) example of
unreliable narration. The subtitle
of the game, “A Thief’s End”, has

multiple meanings. One of these
refers to the infamous pirate, Henry
Avery, whose story is told over the
course of many chapters. It is his
treasure (valued in the hundreds of
millions) that the Drake brothers
chase after. To find it they travel
to the secretive pirate colony of
Libertalia. Throughout this journey
the environments that the brothers
encounter tell stories themselves,
depicting the rise and downfall of
a once revered man. Their quest is
not helped by the obstruction of the
treasure hunter Rafe Adler who has
hired the help of Nadine Ross and
her private military firm (who serve
as the game’s main bullet fodder).
The motivations of these villains
might be barely explained but they
are sinister nonetheless.
The problem with talking about
the gameplay of Uncharted is that
it is always the least interesting
aspect of the experience. While the
gunplay has been improved it’s still
the most tiresome part of the game.
To Naughty Dog’s credit the length
of these shooting sections has been
substantially reduced and they
are now more equally distributed
feel like padding and when massive
distances have to be traversed
players drive vehicles instead.
Among the features added to the
game, the most exciting addition
is the new rope swinging mechanic
which is used to cross vast distances
and chasms. This is an extension of
the already fluid system of climbing
and overcoming obstacles and
adds thrill to exhilarating escape
sequences and moments of disaster.
If Uncharted was not the videogame
version of Indiana Jones before, it
certainly is now.
It is not an exaggeration to
proclaim Uncharted 4 as one of
the defining games of the action-
adventure genre so far – it does so
much right (although admittedly
only after years of experimentation
and refinement). What it fails
to do is fully explore the other
meaning of “A Thief’s End.” This
is obvious a reference to the end
of the series and Nathan Drake as
a thief. Yet for all he has stolen he
never questions the the imperialist
nature of his actions, or the actions
of those he is chasing after (Henry
Avery and the rest of his pirate
society). We are free to plunder the
environments of Uncharted – in
fact, we are rewarded in doing so –
yet this is never questioned. Drake
takes these cultural artefacts and
stores them in an attic where no one
else can experience them, an act of
selfishness that Naughty Dog seem
intent on ignoring.

Noire (which was unable to escape
the uncanny valley), Uncharted
4 blurs the line between digital
characters and film. The excellent
contributions of the voice actors,

in this regard, delivering some of
their best performances so far.
