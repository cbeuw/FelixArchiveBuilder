PC Music are not dead

astThursday’s Pop Cosmos
was another of PC Music’s
rare live shows,assembling
together the collective for
an evening of non-stop music. In
the run up to the event at London’s
Scala, gig-goers are told that this is
an evening to “lose yourself in an
immersive journey to the end of
time.” The stage is decorated with
poorly made space-age objects, and
the merchandise stand is lined with
reflective foil as if it were the outside
ofaspace-craft.It’sasifthecollective
are suggesting they are from the
future, or at least accelerating at the
speed of light towards it. I believe
this understanding of PC Music is
incorrect–futuremusicisnotheaded
in this direction. They are instead a
reaction to mass consumerism and
hyper-marketisation, critiquing the
present.
While the Danny L Harle might
have been top of the bill, this was an
evening where all of the PC Music
collective were equal. Each artist
takes to the stage for no more than
30 minutes.The homogenous nature
of the net label’s catalogue results in
an evening where the boundaries
between each artist begin to blur.
This is a collection of artists who

are variations and mutations of each
other, often coalescing to form new
projects.
The evening ends with a set from
Harle, an artist who has quickly
found his place at the top of the PC
success (relative to his PC Music
collaborators). At one point Harle
leaves the comfort of the mixing
desk and prances around the stage
shouting at someone dressed in a
green morph suit. Soon they work
together and throw free “huge
danny” t-shirts into the crowd.
Like good consumers, the crowd
lap up their free gifts. Does Harle
do this to mask the quality of his
set or is this all part of their hyper-
consumerist critique? We’ll likely
never know, as the collective are
incredibly secretive.As his set enters
its final moments, he picks up an
electric guitar and drones into the
darkness of the night.
Before Harle’s slightly
disappointing appearance, A.G.
Cook performs a smaller set of more
experimental tracks. His brilliance
is what holds the collective together,
and his frequent collaborations
with external artists gives him more
diverse material for the evening.
QT (of ‘Hey QT’fame) drifts across
the stage halfway through Cook’s
performance, delivering to Cook
her branded energy drink. It’s an
ultimate tease that never pays off (to
the crowd’s disappointment).
Hannah Diamond joins him
at the 20 minute mark adding
her child-like vocals to his catchy
chiptune-like backing tracks.
By far the highlight of the evening
is GFOTY (Girlfriend of the Year),
whose set comes off the back off the
release of her latest EP, VIPOTY,
performing the same songs as on her
tour with Animal Collective earlier
this year. Energetic, dynamic and
unhinged, she shares the stage with
two dancers who play off her moves.
To the amusement of the room,
GFOTY starts the her time on stage
with ‘Got My Chad,’ miming with
a high-school prom inspired band.
Soon after this mock performance
is finished and the suits are thrown
off, the real set starts. GFOTY
screams and shouts at the audience,
admitting that she is no singer.
Her music is more spoken word
than singing and there’s an honesty
to her lyrics that makes her so
refreshing. Each artist that is part of
the PC Music project has their own
distinctive character, and among
these GFOTY is most interesting.
It is an obvious parody of lad-
culture from a female perspective.
Whether or not her performance is
empowering, however, depends on
your perspective of casual sex and
intoxication.GFOTY is no stranger
to controversy – with a number of
unacceptable racist remarks in the
past – and her performance reflects
this; it is provocative, lyrically and
in its choreography. As she leaves
the stage much of the energy of the
night leaves too.
The order of the night has
no relevance. There is no clear
progression between the slightly
distinct sounds. Others in the
collective also make appearances,
but the are barely memorable.I once
thought PC Music were deadly
serious, but it’s obvious they’re a
joke – a parody of popular culture
– even if they aren’t willing to admit
it.

Music hierarchy. His music is less
alien and more accessible, compared
to the obnoxious electronica of
some of his peers. While other
artists in the collective have made
music that seems solely for personal
consumption, Harle has written
and produced tracks that are made
for the club. Emblazoned on his
t-shirts and interspersed throughout
his set in the phrase “huge danny.”
And his music adheres to this; it is
massive, epic, and “huge”in its radio
