Ice sheet melting faster than predicted
A
ntarctica boasts the
largest mass of ice on
earth, a colossal 27
million km3
, comprised
of three vast ice sheets: the East, the
West and the Antarctic Peninsula.
With warming seas and climbing
temperatures,scientistsfocusedtheir
attention on the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet, due to its vulnerability to
rising water temperatures, being
grounded far below sea level.
However, new research from
Imperial College institutions in
Australia, New Zealand and the
US, reveal that the East Antarctic
Ice Sheet is becoming alarmingly
unstable.The EAIS holds even more
ice than its Western counterpart,
which is already beginning to
collapse, and is predicted to
contribute four metres in sea level
rise.
The new cause for concern is the
circulating warm water beneath a
critical part of the Totten Glacier,
one of many glaciers supporting the
EAIS. This water is contributing
to the melting of the glacier, and
if it retreats a mere 150km more, it
will trigger a rapid retreat of up to
300km due to the interaction with
the sedimentary rocks below. Now,
this 300km retreat may take several
centuries, but once this threshold

Dr Matthew Genge has been
unlocking the mysteries of the
universe through his research on
micrometeorites – otherwise known
as cosmic dust. Last week however,
Genge published a paper in Nature
which opened some doors to
understanding Earth’s secrets, and
has potentially turned some age-old
scientific theories on their head.
It’s commonly thought our early
atmosphere had little to no oxygen,
and was mostly carbon dioxide
like the choking atmospheres of
Venus and Mars are now. However,
2.4 billion years ago, in the Great
Oxygenation Event, ocean bacteria
began multiplying and heavily
breathing,, bringing our atmosphere
to the familiar, comfortable level of
21% oxygen.
This accepted view is now
challenged based on the discovery
of 60 micrometeorites found in
the arid Pilbara region of western
Australia, dated at 2.7 billion years
old, 300 million years before this
oxygenation event. These tiny
rocks were found to contain iron
oxide, which had been transformed
from traces of metallic iron. This
elemental change must have
required high levels of oxygen which
the comet was exposed to as it fell
through our atmosphere. These
levels though are not supported by
our current theories on the earth’s
early atmosphere.
After studying the dust and
running mathematical models,
Genge and his team realised the
data unavoidably pointed to an
oxygen rich atmosphere. As all
previous research supported the
theory of oxygen-starved lower
atmosphere, it was time for
Genge and his colleagues to think
differently about early atmospheric
composition: “We looked at the
data in the papers saying oxygen
was very poor in abundance at low
altitude, and we couldn’t fault it –
that looks as if it’s true. Our data
looks as if it’s true that there’s lots
of oxygen in the upper atmosphere,
therefore we need to come up with
a way of separating the lower and
upper atmosphere.”
Based on the evidence in the
cosmic dust, the scientists theorised
there must have been an oxygen rich
upper atmosphere that was likely
Cosmic dust hints at alternate history
is crossed, the stability of the rest
of the glacier, moreover the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet, will be left to
the mercy of the elements.
The retreat would become
unstoppable, causing a sea level
rise of around 2.9m from this
glacier alone. The theory behind
this pattern of rapid retreat comes
from studying the geology of the

separated by a thin methane haze
from the lower atmosphere. This
methane layer would have prevented
mixing between the two, which
would explain the data supporting
the oxygen poor lower atmosphere.
Where the oxygen came from is still
unclear; the current working theory
is that the sun’s UV rays split CO2,
but more research has yet to be done
to figure out why.
In the meantime, Genge says
rocks below the glacier. Following
patterns of retreat and advance,
evidence from geophysical surveys
suggests much more rapid retreat
when the ice hits more unstable
regions of rock. These unstable
regions could again come into play
with the increasing rate of retreat.
The scale of the EAIS and Totten
makes this discovery particularly
concerning. Totten itself is around
220,000 square miles in area, bigger
than the US State of California. In
some parts the ice is 2.5 miles thick,
so the potential loss of ice is massive.
However, Totten is dwarfed by the
size of the ice sheet it supports: the
EAIS makes up two thirds of the
entire Antarctic ice sheet.
Co-author of the study, Professor
Martin Siegert,emphasises the need
for concern.“The East Antarctic Ice
Sheet is by far the largest mass of ice
on Earth, so any small changes have
a big influence globally."
the plan is to keep looking for
micrometeorites to study and
“potentially do a time sequence and
see how the dust changed”. If lucky,
they might find whether there were
any changes in atmospheric oxygen
content 2.7 billion years ago.
And while cosmic dust may seem
far removed from our life, Genge
argues sharing the fascination of
research is key to sparking interest
in science, which we should keep in
mind in our studies and research:
“What we’re doing is pushing the
boundaries of science and coming
up with these little gems about the
past that excite people about science.
I think if you talk to every single
scientist, we all have an inherent
interest in science, but there’s
usually a book or a newspaper story
or something, National Geographic
or something, that made you go:
Wow that’s really cool.”

celebrated in many cultures for
millennia. Despite its cultural
significance though, it is currently
a class A, schedule I drug, making
not only its possession a criminal
offence that can lead to up to seven
years in prison, but also making it
nearly impossible for scientists to
get their hands on.
For the conduction of the
Carhart-Harris study for example,
the artificially manufactured
psilocybin had to be approved by
the Home Office.
“It had to be stored incredibly
securely in a certain building at
Hammersmith Hospital and in
order for us to prescribe it, you had
to have your name on the Home
Office high list as a schedule I
prescriber” says Dr Camilla Day,
It’s hard out there for class A drug research
one of the psychiatrists helping on
the study.
These strict regulations governing
psilocybin use are a result of the 2005
Drug Act, which effectively made
it easier to access highly addictive
narcotics such as methadone, a
heroin substitute, than shrooms.
But there's more than just
bureaucracy hindering access and
research. There's a stigma. As put
by Day,“Although you don't see any
objective evidence for preventing
the research of these drugs, because
of the whole cultural and moral
status quo you are a bit anxious.”
Indeed challenging the status quo
can cost scientists their careers, as
was illustrated by Professor David
Nutt who lost his position as the
government’s chief drug advisor in
Science, what’s good?

ver the past year, a
dozen patients have
been fortunate enough
to participate in an
innovative study, led by Dr Robin
Carhart-Harris, exploring a novel
treatment for depression. Last week
it was announced that all twelve,
though resistant to conventional
treatments, responded positively
to this new antidepressant. Only it
wasn’t exactly a new antidepressant
they were responding to. It was
psilocybin, a compound known for
making some mushrooms... magic

2009. But for many it is worth the
risk.“This is a substance which could
have beneficial effects for many
people given in the right setting
with appropriate support, and it is
the alternative of not researching
it that I find incredibly immoral”
continues Day.
The sentiment is shared by many
other researchers willing to stake
their reputations studying medical
applications of illegal substances
such as Ketamine and MDMA.
Day herself will continue working
on the Carhart-Harris study,
starting a randomised control trial
next February.
“It is really important for this
research to go ahead. We’re at the
forefront of an exciting field."
It’s been many years now since
amphibian communities started
collapsing across the world. The
global pattern has made many
think that a single culprit lied in
the epicentre of the crisis. Yet,
despite the adoption of a range of
approaches, nothing has been able
to stave off the decline. A team of
researchers from the U.S. analysed
amphibian population trends across
the continent and assessed the
degree to which various threats
contributed to the declines. They
found that decline rate not only
varies from region to region,but also
that different factors such as human
activity, or pesticide prevalence
and of course disease (looking at
you Chytrid fungus) contributed
to the decline in different ways.
Unfortunately the study doesn’t
provide a simple fix, quite the
opposite; it rejects the existence
of a smoking gun , a single culprit
and subsequently a single solution.
Things are complicated and saving
amphibians won’t be easy.

When babies are born
prematurely, they’re often extremely
light and are immediately put in
an incubator. Some might develop
health problems later on, a known
complication being cardiovascular
disease. Seldom though will a heavy
newborn weighing above the five
pound mark elicit gasps of dismay
from its parents (“I’m sorry Mary…
Our baby… it’s fat”). However a
new study suggests that big babies
might also have a higher chance of
suffering from cardiovascular disease
later on in life. The study looked at
adolescents aged 14-18 and found
that those with birthweight close
to both ends of the spectrum were
more likely to have dangerous fat
around major organs. However,
regardless of birthweight, the odds
may be reversed with exercise and a
healthy diet.The researchers behind
the study give familiar advice:
Don’t smoke when pregnant and
breastfeed. The former may stunt
babies at birth while the later may
provide much needed protection.

The moon is a mysterious
seductress, but in a victorious
moment, a team of scientists
managed to shed light on two of
her darker secrets. The Southwest
Research Institute scientists in
fact managed to discover two new
craters on the dark side of the
moon. The craters were found with
the use of the LAMP instrument
aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter (LRO). LAMP uses the
far-ultraviolet Lyman-alpha band
skyglow and light from ultraviolet-
bright stars to “see” in the dark and
image the permanently shaded
regions of the Moon.
These craters were particularly
hard to study due to their immense
depth, which makes them really
hard to catch any light whatsoever.
The team also determined their
age, namely 16 million for one
and somewhere between 75 and
420 million years for the other,
which makes them relatively young
geologically. The discovery will
hopefully shed light on the birth of
our solar system.

Yellow fever (YF) has for the
first time found its way into Asia.
The findings come from a study
from the International Journal of
Infectious Diseases, which warns
that if WHO doesn’t take action,
we may risk a progression from an
outbreak to an epidemic. Although
the YF vaccine is very effective there
remain many large unvaccinated
populations. So far there have been
2420 cases reported and 298 deaths.
From the total number of incidents
though less than a third have been
clinically assessed. However it is
suspected that the extent of the
outbreak is much more severe, with
the reported cases amounting to
only two to ten percent of the total
incidents. If these estimates are
correct, the combination of spread
through mass global transport and
vaccination shortages could lead
to a global health crisis. The main
vector, A. aegypti is also of concern,
since populations have grown, as
demonstrated by the Zika outbreak.

W
hy is vaping taking
the globe by storm?
Hint:it’s marketing.
Yes, a new study
shows that advertising works,
especially on easily impressionable
teens.The study from the University
of Texas found that the use of
e-cigs rose significantly with
exposure to vaping ads but also
that the more advertising media
types the adolescents were exposed
to, the stronger the nudge to
vape became. It’s noted that only
between 2011 and 2012, spending
on vaping marketing in the U.S.
tripled, reaching an estimated $18.3
million. Although there seems to be
disagreement on how e-cigs should
be treated from a health policy
perspective, this study strongly
suggests a similar course of action
to the one we’ve seen in tobacco
advertising.
