Petition to air con in the library hits 1000 signatures
We’re doing it for you guys
Imperial has invested £2.3 million in tobacco
firms via its endowment fund
Indirect investments clash with college’s anti-cancer research efforts
continued from front page
The £2,384,327.09 that FELIX
calculated Imperial is investing
in these firms is just a fraction of
the £201 million or so the college
has invested as part of its total
endowment.
Other universities, such as
Edinburgh, have divested from
tobacco firms, after it was
pointed out that the university’s
research efforts clashed with such
investments.
A college spokesperson told
FELIX: “It is College policy
to neither undertake research
to develop or promote tobacco
products, nor to directly invest in
tobacco companies.”
“Where the College delegates
investment decisions to its external
fund managers, they are instructed
F
ELIX’s petition to get air
conditioning in the library
has had a strong opening
week, reaching 1000
signatures on its third day, showing
how keen students are for better
revision conditions.
Comments from miffed students
on why they signed the petition
range from the factual: “I am a
student at Imperial and I find the
library very hot” to the less serious:
“MAKE THE LIBRARY GREAT
AGAIN”, “I don't want to melt”,
and “It’s a shepherd’s pie in there”.
Other commenters get straight to
the real talk: “Because I pay £26,000
a year in tuition fees”and some really
break it down: “You are supposedly
educating our next generation of
scientists. Any educationalist will
tell you that comfort and confidence
lead to success.Buildings are created
to reduce external influences eg
cold, wind and even heat. Students
overheating does not equate to
comfort and and the right learning
environment. Imperial you are one
of the richest universities, get a grip
and put in air conditioning!”
Imperial successfully applied for
planning permission for the air
conditioning units needed back in
2014, however, nothing has been
done with these plans since then.
The library needs £13.5 million to
complete the necessary works, but it
has only been allocated half of the
money.
This issue is one many students
have rallied behind, and we believe
that if enough of us shout loud
enough, all together, at the right
time of year, college might hear us,
and fork out for some air con.
The £6.75 million still needed by
the library could pay for one tall
strawberries and cream frappuccino
for every student, every week of
term for the next three years. Air
conditioning would probably last
longer though.
We’re planning on presenting
the petition to senior members
of college this week, so any final
signatures could really help our case.

presenting
the petition
to college
this week
not to directly invest in tobacco
companies.”
“Some of their investments
are, however, in managed funds.
The College and its external fund
managers have no control over
the composition of those funds,
which change on a continual basis.
The College Endowment Board
has a responsibility to optimise
investment return to support
Imperial’s academic mission but
continues to keep its policies under
review, which includes looking
at ways to avoid even indirect
investment in tobacco.”
