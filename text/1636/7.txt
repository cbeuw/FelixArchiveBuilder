1061 people can't be wrong
Air conditioning in central library must be a top priority for the sabbaticals
Philip Kurukgy
Writer
A
n expected outbreak of
support for FELIX’s
campaign for air
conditioning in the
library has seriously raised questions
about the role of the union in
delivering student demands.
Imperial provides great facilities
to study in and world class labs, but
falls short in the central library.
From personal experience, I avoid
studying at that place at all costs (the
horrid smell, serious lack of oxygen,
and ridiculous smell of damp).
The campaign, strangely enough,
started in the FELIX office, where
they actually listen to what students
have to say. What is even more
surprising is the complete silence
and astonishment of the “Beit
Sabbatical Establishment”.
1050 signatures should at least
warrant a response and a promise
from the Union president to deliver
on a student petition. The 2016
Leadership election saw a very
familiar theme with what we’ve seen
'Social justice warriors' would do well to listen to their own sermon of tolerance

here has been a recent rise
of an online stronghold
of cultural libertarianism,
which has been deemed
by some to be a reactionary
movement against the regressive left.
Classically liberal and conservative
figures are breaking down the
barriers between the political left
and right, and are coming together
to discuss a multitude of ideas
including free speech, political
correctness, censorship and 'safe
spaces' in the university scene, and
cultural relativity.
Here is my #MessageToFeminists
Prominent figureheads in the
discussion include talk show
host Dave Rubin, equity feminist
Christina Hoff Sommers,
libertarian activist Lauren Southern
and controversial gay conservative
Milo Yiannopoulos.
It was only a matter of time
until something so contentious as
a #MessageToFeminists campaign
would arise. The hashtag, created by
one Taleed Brown on his Youtube
channel That Guy T, aimed to
stimulate debate on the current
feminist movement by giving a
voice to its most common critiques.
Originally devised as a Youtube
challenge, the hashtag is now
making rounds on Twitter, drawing
attention to the need for an actual
intellectual conversation and free
exchange of ideas, which many
believe has failed to take place in a
monotonic, stifling PC culture.
Brown himself had this message
to impart: “The rejection of
individualist freedom for the pursuit
of authoritarian equality is not
empowerment.”
Indeed, more and more
‘systematically-oppressed classes’
are speaking out against the
neoprogressive doctrines that
modern feminism promulgates.This
is certainly not tantamount to the
opposition of classical liberalism:
often the opposite, actually. I,
myself, believe a part of classical
liberalism is updating, reforming
and exchanging our opinions and
beliefs where necessary (Bayesian
inference, anyone?) to preserve
intellectual integrity.
So, here is my
#MessageToFeminists (specifically,
third-wavers): why not embrace
the criticism and use it to benefit
and reform the movement? Why is
unfavourable dissent being shut out
andshutdown?Aremodernfeminist
idealogies too flimsy to withstand
scrutiny? Why is the movement so
intolerant of its questioners, despite
claims of diversity and acceptance?
Karl Popper’s paradox of tolerance
comes to mind.
Everyone knows the dictionary
definition of feminism. It has been
repeated ad nauseam to the public
through progressive media outlets
and popular celebrities. The reason,
then, must run deeper as to why so
many refuse to associate themselves
with the movement. If everything
boiled down to a dictionary
definition, we'd have many more
people comfortably identifying as
feminists. The trouble is that third
wave feminism, the poster child of
the regressive left and PC culture, is
not reflecting that definition.
Also relevant is the unspoken
obligation to subscribe by default to
certain feminist theories other than
the otherwise harmless dictionary
definition. Privilege theory, as
preached by third wave feminism,
as practised today, is demonstrably
flawed. So is intersectional theory,
which divides the classes rather
than unifying them. I concede
that these theories were conceived
with good intentions, and that
certain aspects of these theories
do hold water. However, one need
merely consider the recent incident
involving Oxford student activist
Ntokozo Qwabe to get a sense of
how far these progressive idealogies
are being taken by their proponents,
and how they are being used to
justify actual discrimination. What
is remarkable is not that Qwabe
and a fellow social activist publicly

harassed a white waitress on the
basis of her ethnicity (reducing her
to what Qwabe gleefully refers to
as ‘white tears’). What is scary is
that Qwabe justified his actions by
explaining how ethnic minorities
cannot be racist due to the
systematic oppression and invisible
structures of society working against
marginalized classes.
This concerns me gravely. We
are cultivating a generation of
millennials who bully and actually
marginalize individuals of another
background while operating under
the guise of social justice!
Real life is not a novel where
the Draco Malfoys are so easily
identified. In the current day we
have bullies of a different variety,
the ‘social justice warriors’ who
genuinely believe they are fighting
on the right side of things. This
is more dangerous than a generic
schoolyard bully, who at least
operates clearly on the outside of
a communal moral code (everyone
knows that harassing another kid
for lunch money is wrong) and can't
justify his or her actions by claiming
a ‘moral enlightenment’.
Many feminists are convinced
of the superiority of their idealogy
in society. Look no further than
Mark Ruffalo’s Tumblr post telling
women against feminism to “kiss
my ass”. How will this possibly get
more people to join his feminist
cause? To put this in perspective,
imagine if this was the method
used to draw awareness to any other
activist movement campaigning for
environmental concerns, animal
rights, or even a religion. Wouldn’t
mass disapproval ensue?
Thusly,many feminists run the risk
of becoming intractable and unable
to adapt to opposing viewpoints.
After all, what other viewpoint is
there to adopt, outside of our own
superior construction?
I hope we all agree that feminism
needs to be more than running
around harassing others in the
name of creating a ‘liberal, tolerant,
diverse culture’. To me, this is not
progression! It is regression.
Are modern
feminist
idealogies
too flimsy to
withstand
scrutiny?
Feminists
run the
risk of
becoming
intractable
globally – a discontentment with
power – with the underachieving
“Beit Quad Cartel” and “CV
patching sabbaticals”. Imperial’s
sabbaticals are elected in the largest
democratic university elections in
England, with a clear mandate to
raise the issues that we care about
as students, but failing to do so is a
failure at their jobs.
The environment in which we
spend months of summer term
trying to untangle our degrees must
be a priority. We not only deserve
air conditioning, but demand it;
our tuition fees justify it. I strongly
believe the new union president
Nas should make it a priority to
negotiate with college to deliver
this. Some funds and licenses are
already in place. Nothing justifies
the ridiculous state of a five floor
incinerator with a nauseating smell.
As a member of the union council
I can tell you that many things are
wrong in this union, like that the
council doesn’t meet and sabbaticals
are only accountable to themselves.
Did the union deliver significant
change to each and every one of
us this year besides £2.60 pints,
sports nights and a fiasco Summer
Ball headliner? The union's role is

to “enhance student’s experience at
Imperial.” Well the people demand
air conditioning and you better
deliver, or your office is not only
undermined, but void of sense and
purpose.

L
et me start by saying that,
generally, I am pro EU.
Before university,I went to
a European school, where
I was taught extensively about the
European Union in my history and
geography classes. I’m not blind to
the faults of the EU, namely that
it is a prohibitively beaurocratic
institution run by technocrats and
MEPs elected by only 42.5% of the
voting public. Nonetheless, I would
argue that on the whole, the EU is
beneficial to Europeans.
However, the EU has not been a
good thing for the rest of the world.
In particular, the EU's policies on
immigration and agriculture have
particularly detrimental effects on
the developing world. The term
‘Fortress Europe’ was originally
coined in the Second World War
to describe the areas of continental
Europe occupied by Nazi Germany,
but it is an equally apt description of
Europe’s policies today.
The cornerstone of EU farming
policy is the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP), which subsidises
farming within the EU, accounting
for nearly 40% of the EU’s budget.
Along with tariffs on food coming
from outside of the EU, the CAP
has allowed EU countries to become
largely self-sufficient on food post-
war.This protectionism (common to
most developed countries) not only
makes some foods more expensive
for Europeans,it also harms farmers
in developing countries who not
only can’t afford to export their
food, but also have to deal with
artificially cheap products coming
from the EU.
Then there’s immigration: over
the past year we’ve been told that
there’s a refugee crisis in Europe.
There isn’t, at least not in Europe.
Lebanon and Jordan have opened
their borders to 2.5 million refugees
in the past four years, representing a
20% increase in the total population
of these two countries. Compare
this to the 200,000 refugees that
the EU is now trying to deport to
Turkey which represent an increase
of 0.04% in the EU’s population.
Jordan and Lebanon are reaching
a tipping point which could easily
be avoided if the EU opened its
borders and shared the burden of
this humanitarian crisis.
What makes this all particularly
galling is that, through the WTO
and other organisations, the EU
promotes neo-liberal policies like
free trade and migration while
doing exactly the opposite at home.
These policies are often imposed
on developing countries through
IMF and World Bank loans, but it
happens at home as well; in 2012
EU loans to Greece were granted
on the condition that Greece open
up its energy sector.
The debate over Brexit has
revolved around, "Would this make
me better off?". While I would like
to think that the whole point of the
EU is that it turns the ‘me’ into an
‘us’, the truth is the EU is just as
self-interested as any other nation.
