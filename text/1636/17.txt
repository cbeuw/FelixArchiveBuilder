E
ver since it was introduced,
The Walking Dead’s
popularity has soared
through the roof. Another
Zombie apocalypse styled story,
the franchise has a comic book, TV
series, video game, and now, with
Fear the Walking Dead, a spin-off
TV series. With the main show still
airing and already in place however,
it begs the question, does this show
add anything new and substantially
different?
The short answer is yes: there’s
enough to differentiate this spin-off
series from the adventures of Rick
Grimes and company in Atlanta.
Fear the Walking Dead takes place
on the other side of the United
States and features completely new
and different characters to root for
(and eventually weep tears for). The
most significant difference however,
is the fact that it takes place in the
early days of the apocalypse; we get
to see a normal functioning society
descend into chaos and disorder.
This was a time period skipped
over in the original series as it went
straight into the action.
The premise alone does make this
show intriguing and engaging to
watch. Who doesn’t want to see the
big and bustling metropolis of Los
Angeles descend into chaos? As the
show goes forward, we see the first
zombies make their presence felt.
It’s a slow burn from a seemingly
normal day to a society where law
and order breaks down altogether.
The show is wracked with tension
and suspense as events happen one
after another and things escalate
to new heights. There are several
effective moments which detail the
fall of a city, from cops taking down
a zombie on a freeway, to a SWAT
team surrounding a hospital.
The main characters of the show
are part of a large and dysfunctional
family group. For the most part,
everyone is written like real and
believable characters. However, a
couple of them are teenagers, and
with this, we get the cliche and
annoying problems that come with
them. One of the characters, Nick
Clark, is a heroin addict who finds
himself suffering from withdrawal
symptoms and is constantly trying
to get a fix, scavenging through
people’s medicine cabinets. Another
character, Christopher, is the typical
rebellious teenager: difficult at times
and resentful of his father’s divorce.
The dysfunctional family unit
meant that there was also some
unwanted drama between ex-wives
and difficulty with cooperation
in general. However, eventually,
everyone is able to band together and
work against the craziness around
them. Not everyone makes it to the
end, obviously, but characters are
able to shed some of their annoying
quirks as things go on.
However, before people start
working together, a giant ditch of
dumb decision takes place. As is
usually common with the survival
horror genre, characters act like
boneheads at times and as viewers,
this is especially frustrating to watch.
For example, near the beginning,
some characters with more
experience refuse to have stark and
serious conversations about what’s
been going on. The whole ‘in the
dark’ aspect acts like an unnerving
security blanket in season one,
where people don’t know things and
have information kept from them
which leads to an infuriating block
of central characters.
I don’t want to sound too negative
but the dumb decisions and choices
are a semi-regular occurrence, and
these are what ultimately hampers
the show from becoming much
greater than what it currently is.
Occasionally there’s some good
stuff done by the characters here
and there and when they deal with
the fallout of their actions, it can be
refreshing to watch.
Amidst these bad choices, there
is a great deal of good stuff that
comes out which makes everything
worth it. Some of the characters are
compelling and have interesting
back stories that reveal what makes
them tick. Two which stand out
the most are Colman Domingo
as Victor Strand, a shady ex-
businessman who is basically this
show’s Carol (main series badass)
and Rubén Blades as Daniel Salazar,
a Salvadoran refugee who would
protect his family at any cost.
The setting also changes as the
characters move around, each with
its own style and charm. Along the
way, new characters show up that
we get to meet (and watch die).
In addition, the story moves in
interesting and unique directions
which grab your attention and
make you want to see how things go
along.For example,there’s an escape
on a yacht! How that happens and
where it leads to is something that
leaves you wanting more.
Fear the Walking Dead may have
seemed like an unnecessary spin-off
at first, but it has grown to become
its own unique thing. While some
choices and plot elements can
be frustrating to watch, there is
ultimately more good done than
bad. With the second season
currently airing and the show
having been renewed for a third, it
is definitely interesting to see how
these particular group of survivors
will fare in the zombie apocalypse.
Fear the Walking Dead is available
on Amazon Prime and Hulu
