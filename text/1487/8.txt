How the Tutorial System works
As an Imperial student, you have ac-
cess to dedicated staff members whose
job it is to make sure that any problems
you have during your course, be they
academic or non-academic, are re-
solved. They have different names de-
pending on your course level; you have
probably met some of the tutors during
meetings scheduled by your Depart-
ment. You can talk to them about any
and all problems you’re having, and
it’s a good idea to keep in close contact
with them as they are a valuable source
of support and guidance. This person
should be easily contactable and avail-
able to meet with you. If you have a
problem and can’t contact them, or if
they are difficult to contact you can
talk to a more senior member of staff

who will work to ensure that the per-
son is more contactable/responsive in
future and who can offer an alternative
source of help.
Especially now during the exam pe-
riod, it is important that your let your
tutors know should you encounter any
difficulties or circumstances which im-
pinge upon your revision or report writ-
ing. They will be able to advise you on
how to go about resolving this or point
you in the right direction.
Who’s there for me?
Most undergraduates should know who
their tutors are, however, postgraduate
tutors are listed below.
Masters students also each have a Per-
sonal Tutor. This is usually a member of
academic staff allocated to you for the

duration of your course to offer help
and support and follow your personal
progress. MSc students can contact their
Course Coordinator/Convenor if they’re
having issues with their Personal Tutor.
MRes students will each have a project
supervisor and can contact the Post-
graduate Tutor in their department as an
alternative source of support.
Postgraduate Research (PhD) students
have a mentor and a supervisor (and
possibly a second supervisor). Their
Postgraduate Tutor also has a welfare
role and will normally be the first source
of advice if there are difficulties with
(or between) supervisors. Research stu-
dents who are unhappy with these can
contact the College Tutors, especially if
the nature of the difficulty extends out-
side your home department.
Exam Stress and other issues
If you have any issues in the run up
to exams make sure you tell your tu-
tor or another member of staff in your
Department – they may be able to help.
If you think there’s anything that could
affect your exam performance (other
than a lack of revision) it’s a good
idea to fill out an extenuating circum-
stances form before your exams so that
it can be considered when your exam
is marked. The form is available from
your department.
Don’t forget that it’s never too late
to improve your exam chances (until,
well the exams). Think about studying
smarter, not harder. Do all the obvious
stuff like taking care of yourself and
making sure you don’t have too many
or too few breaks, and have another
look over Imperial’s study guide, avail-
able as a PDF at: http://www3.imperial.
ac.uk/students/studyguide for revision
techniques you might not have thought
of. Good luck!
