FELIX Friday 06 may 2011 31
Scorpio
This week, you have an existential
crisis. It preoccupies you for a few
minutes but unfortunately existential
crises aren’t useful revision tools so
you ignore the majesty, strangeness, and
complexity of existence and go back to
doing algebra. Sigh...
Horoscopes
Aries
This week, you’re seriously considering
offering your lecturer sexual favours
in return for exam questions. Like a
true entrepeneur, you make a slide
presentation before talking to him. Your
proposal is called “Ass for Questions.”
He agrees, you hurt.
Taurus
This week, the Union lift is finally
working again. But the question on
everyone’s lips is “Did Donald Trump
really abseil from an eagle and dick
Osama in the face?” Like the mystery of
Obama’s mother’s birth certificate, I’m
worried that we’ll never know the truth...
Gemini
This week, you’re all ready to go to the
Summer Ball wearing leather chaps and
a gimp mask when people start clam-
ouring for black-tie. Sigh. Fine. You
go to the Ball wearing leather chaps, a
gimp mask AND a black-tie. Fucking
whiny twats.
Cancer
This week, you decide to take a break
from revision and have a beer in the Un-
ion. Before you know it you’re on a one-
way flight to Mexico with a greasy-haired
Swede called Hussain. He calls you beau-
tiful. You call your Senior Tutor and tell
him you won’t be sitting your exams.
Leo
This week, you suddenly wake up in the
exam room. Fuck, how long have you
been asleep? You lean over to the guy
on the next table and ask loudly, “Hey
Human, what year is it?” Nobody is
amused. You get kicked out of univer-
sity. You still don’t know what year it is.
Virgo
This week, you’re in the library,
studying as hard you as possibly can.
You’ve been going for 12 hours solidly
when your brain gives up and shuts-
down. It’s a weird sensation. It’s as if
you... DON’T... GIVE... a... SHIT...
ANYMORE...
Libra
This week, you’re staring out of the
library windows, at the smug bastards
outside enjoying the sunshine. The
heavenly sunshine. You shake your fists
at them. You suddenly wake up in the
middle of a biology exam. You don’t do
biology...
Sagittarius
This week, you’re chewing on your
nails. They actually taste quite good.
Kind of like candy floss. A dinosaur
sized gummy bear suddenly walks
by, chatting to John Lennon... Wait a
minute. You’re asleep again, aren’t you?
Goddamnit!!!
Capricorn
This week, you meet a Prince. A
fresh prince. He tells you he’s from
Philadelphia. You tell him you don’t
date soft cheese. He tells you that
you’ve misunderstood him. You tell him
that you’re a Imperial dropout and not to
“use fancy words with me mister!”
Aquarius
This week, you’re wholly convinced
that all the exam-related jokes in the
horoscopes are the funniest thing
since Prince William came too soon.
Mostly because you don’t have exams
to revise for. Oh wait, that’s just me.
MWHWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Pisces
This week, you realise that the Royal
Wedding didn’t change your life one
bit. You call up the Queen and say “Oi
bitchface! I want my money back!” The
examiner takes your phone off you and
kicks you out of the exam room. You’re
still waiting for your money...

the turnip
Environmental Physics exam to become more
environmentally friendly
I
n a drive to “practice what they
preach”, several changes have been
introduced to the optional course in
the Physics syllabus – effective imme-
diately. The overhaul was a culmination
of a series of incidents such as lecturers
refusing to print off handouts, teaching
in unlit rooms and suffering sleepless
nights over the guilt of doing other-
wise. The final straw came at the end
of last term, when a class was delayed
by half an hour because the lecturer had
boycotted petrol. In protest, several dis-
gruntled students retaliated by leaving
their lights on at home and linking her
to live streams of their rooms.
All problem sheets, solutions and
handouts will henceforth be only avail-
able online and printing discouraged;
students who find it difficult to read
text off a computer screen are advised
to buy a kindle or use the printer while
nobody is looking. The syllabus itself
will remain largely unchanged: apart
from the occasional panda bear in pres-
entation slides to contextualise the pub-
licity aspect of environmentalism, the
course will continue to teach about cli-
mate modelling and alternative energy
resources such as the methane farts of
obese women.
The most important change is how
the course will be examined. Students
will now take a test on Blackboard in
the computing suite. Not only will this
save paper, but also put an end to stu-
dents write in massive letters in order to
use up as many answer booklets as pos-
sible, as some sort of joke. Views from
the students are mixed: on one hand, the
potential for cheating is a definite plus.
However, Saul Russo, a student cur-
rently on the course, isn’t so optimis-
tic: “I spend enough time on Facebook
when I should be studying. What makes
anyone think I won’t be on it during the
exam? It’s torture.”
DRUNKEN MATE
OF THE WEEK
“You can fucking well step over me! I’m not moving from this paddling pool until Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black,
Rihanna, and the now deceased Shah of Iran come and lick my balls...”
Welcome
back, and
enjoy the
Summer
term...
