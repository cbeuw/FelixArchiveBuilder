COMMENT
S
pain, 1936. As civil war
sweeps through the country,
volunteers from all over Eu-
rope flock to the standards
of the Republican and Na-
tionalist armies. Made iconic through
Hemingway’s dry prose and Picasso’s
chilling canvas, the Spanish Civil war
was probably the last real instance in
which thousands of individuals across
Europe took up arms to defend their ide-
als in a foreign state regardless of their
own nation’s views on the matter.
Almost every country in the EU hails
from the blood of foreign nationals who
risked their lives to free them from their
oppressors. From the Hungarian Legion
in Italy during its Risorgimento to the
British citizens, most famously Lord By-
ron, fighting for the freedom of Greece,
modern-day Europe was born of a sense
of brotherhood common to its people.
Nor was this a phenomenon which was
limited to the Mediterranean: in South
America, the British Legion fought for
the independence of Colombia, Venezu-
ela, Ecuador and Peru, while Garibaldi
defended that of Uruguay. Lafayette and
other French volunteers sailed to North
Rhys Davies
America to aid in the American Revolu-
tionary War, and the citizens of the US
reciprocated in both World Wars.
So where are today’s Byrons? As
the fiery Arab Revolution blazes on,
one is left to wonder if the citizens of
our nations will ever heed the call to
arms. A stunningly cynical apathy is
rife amongst the members of our gen-
eration, as if the seventy-five year gap
which separates us from our grandpar-
ents’ situation in Spain had bred noth-
ing but a contemptible attachment to the
easy lifestyle our ancestors shed their
blood for.
This is not the first time the citizens
of democratic nations have failed their
neighbours. As part of a wider blaze
of protests in Eastern Europe and the
Caucasus which accompanied the death
of Stalin, the Hungarian Revolution of
1956 bears many resemblances to the
current situation in Libya. There too a
whole nation spontaneously rose to rid
itself of a hated government. But a dis-
illusioned and spineless West simply
stared on, not lifting a finger in the hyp-
ocritical attempt to preserve a freedom
they let others lose.
We all insist on the values of a lib-
eral and democratic government, but
it would appear that we are also in too
much of a lethargic state to provide any
practical help to people who are trying
to form one of their own. Since the fall
of the Berlin wall, only religious ex-
tremism seems to be able to mobilize
our complacent generation to the ulti-
mate sacrifice. The political organisa-
tions formed the only internal political
structures which allowed British and
other foreign nationals to take a stance
in Spain against the express wish of their
governments, and these no longer exist.
In 1848 democrats all over Europe took
up arms and readily offered their lives
for the cause of freedom, while today’s
liberals can scarcely be bothered to lift
their pens.
Ours is a generation of cowards, more
interested in flicking between channels
to satisfy our perverse curiosity than
to actually take any affirmative action
ourselves. Too comfortable in our well
planned–out lives, we will always be
too busy with our own petty problems
to occupy ourselves with defending a
freedom we do not deserve.
T
here was a wedding last
Friday. One of slightly
more importance than nor-
mal. Did you see it?
I’m afraid I missed it.
Which was a shame because I had a per-
sonal invitation to Westminster Abbey
but a very important engagement came
up at the last moment. There was a wall
that had been recently painted and they
needed someone make absolutely cer-
tain that it dried. Like I said, a shame,
but I’ll catch the next one.
Say what you like about the Royal
Wedding (And I believe Angry Geek al-
ready has, should you care to look at Fe-
lix’s brand-spanking new website...), it
was quite popular. Central London was
filled with people cheering and waving
flags as minibuses of royals drove by.
And bunting. What the hell is bunting?
After the ceremony, once everything had
devolved into a general good time, a lot
of people were saying how proud they
were to be British.
That’s nice for them but what does it
mean? I’ve never considered myself to
be British. I am a Prince of Wales, and
will be until I die and my heart will al-
ways belong to the land of my fathers,
that old land where the minstrels are
honoured and free. But what does it
mean to be British, especially in this
Alessandro Guazzi
age, in this cosmopolitan melting-pot
of a city? The English Defence League
and the British National Party have
very strong ideas of what being British
means. They define themselves as true
Brits so being British must mean being
bigoted and xenophobic, short–sighted
and small–minded, and being painfully,
painfully white. Somehow, this doesn’t
seem correct – and not just because I
don’t want to live in a universe where
the EDL and BNP can be right.
They are both very keen for immi-
grants to go “home” as well, positing
that Britain is for the British. Does that
mean that you’re only British if you’re
born in this green and pleasant land? Is
nationality something that boils down to
just a bit of luck and geography? Again,
I don’t think so. Though an island na-
tion, throughout history, Britain has
played host to a thousand colours and
creeds. Some have moved on afterwards
but many more decided to stay, a testa-
ment to our accepting nature. Except the
French. I draw a line with the French.
Extremists want those who are different
to them to go home but what is home?
Isn’t it somewhere where we feel wel-
come? For many people, that’s right
here, regardless on what’s scribbled on
their birth certificate.
Maybe being British is a matter of
stereotypes. If you conform to a certain
number of hallmarks of Britishness,
maybe that makes you British? So, being
British includes (but is not limited to)
drinking tea, queuing, talking about the
weather, a stiff upper lip and poor dental
hygiene, driving on the left, throwing
vowels in words with reckless abandon
and…royal weddings. While I know a
few people like this, it’s a narrow and
rather twisted definition of Britishness.
Stereotypes simplify trends into absurd-
ity. That’s why the BNP love them so
much. While we do love tea in this coun-
try, we also drink coffee. Can drinking
coffee be a sign of Britishness too?
This might be getting a bit too academic.
If you’re British (Proud or otherwise),
you don’t need someone to tell you,
it’s something you feel, something you
know intuitively. It doesn’t matter if
breathe tea (not an advisable way to im-
bibe it) or can’t stand the stuff. It doesn’t
matter if you were born in Bolton or Bei-
rut. If this strange land, of Buckingham
Palace and Chicken Cottage, of Pimm’s
o’clock and Tennant’s Special Brew, of
red, white and blue – and every other
colour under the sun, means something
to you, maybe that’s what makes you
British.
And if you’re still confused, have a
look at your passport.
How to be British, apparently
“In 1848, democrats
offered their lives
for freedom. Today’s
liberals can scarcely
be bothered to lift
their pens”
Take up arms to defend freedom
“Central London was
filled with people
cheering. And
bunting. What the
hell is bunting?”
It’s all an
Olympic waste
of time
I have been in two minds about
buying my Olympics tickets for
some time. This is a chance
to see some great riding. But
champing at the bit, I am not.
As one may expect, tickets
are not cheap and of course
I want good value for money.
Seeing good horse-and-rider
combinations strut their stuff
is great, but it may be better
value-for-money to invest in
training with one of those rid-
ers. However, regarding tick-
ets, as you may well know, one
cannot simply buy them. It is
a sort of lottery in which one
has to register, ask for what-
ever tickets one wants and
hand over intimate financial/
personal details, all in order to
wait with bated breath at the
prospect of being allocated the
‘requested’ tickets.
I can easily add to this the ne-
cessity of having to use a VISA
card to pay for such tickets. It
looks like a revolting sponsor-
ship deal. This does not recon-
cile with the otherwise rather
sensible explanation currently
doing the rounds. This is that
due to a unique rule governing
the use of VISA accounts, the
tickets bought with them can-
not be sold on to ticket touts
and thus the price not be in-
flated or used as a vehicle for
insalubrious activity. Of course
it is perfectly possible that
such a sensible rule and such
a nauseating sponsorship deal
are not mutually exclusive. If it
were a combination of the two,
I think it would reflect well on
the organisers.
Commentators have been
rather negative about the
Olympics up to now, moaning
that “It’ll be crap because it is
in London and not anywhere
else”, which is itself a relief.
Perhaps the sort of furtive
stubbornness we have seen
from the Olympic organisers
is the result of such attacks.
The side-effects of having peo-
ple tough enough to organise
the largest sporting event in
the world are a revolting logo,
a nauseating sponsorship
deal and a peculiar ticketing
system. It all leaves me with
a feeling that it is not quite
cricket.
