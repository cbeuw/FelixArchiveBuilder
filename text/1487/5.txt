'There is no great genius with-
out some touch of madness.'
(Seneca)
Anthony was always active and
often 'hyperactive' in all positive
senses of the word, ever since
his childhood (after all – there
were always three boys in the
house). Brotherly competition
was always healthy in the house,
competing in strength, in speed,
in eating watermelons, in aca-
demics...
Anthony was amazingly bright
and ambitious; he always looked
to excel, and was passionate
about mechanical engineering.
His mind was full of creativity
and he was always experiment-
ing in all aspects of his life from
tic tacs to magnets, in martial
arts and in engineering. He was
always one step ahead of the
game when it came to mechani-
cal engineering, before KERS in
formula 1 had come out, he had
already thought of the idea of
storing wasted energy in a car
from coasting (when your foot is
off the accelerator) in the form of
electricity to be used (aged 15).
He also had a passion for mag-
nets and had experimented with
devices to shoot out metallic ob-
jects using magnetic energy by
the age of 14, which came to be
known as a 'rail gun' a few years
later. His prediction that electric
cars/motorbikes would dominate
future travel at the age of 16 is
also looking to come true... In
my eyes, he was a true genius
and we had always had a pact to
start our business as the three
of us...
Socially, Anthony was always
full of energy and excitement. He
was a friendly character and was
able to get on with everyone. He
was always the life of the party -
his energy was contagious. He al-
ways tried to live by his favourite
film: 'Yes Man'. Indeed he was
a 'Yes Man', saying yes to life
and trying all sports and activi-
ties from riding on his motorbike,
ballroom dancing, violin, martial
arts, piano, American football,
football, tennis, rock climbing
(the list goes on!)...
I have no fear to say that he
lived his life to the fullest (a qual-
ity that I hope to learn and fulfill)
– so much so that he was never
one to go in the conventional
manner, but always in what he
loved doing best at that moment
in time – and in that moment it so
happened to be swimming in The
Serpentine.
Although I am not religious,
a statement that was taught to
me has always stuck with me
and that is that man has always
wished to live as a God (for as a
God you can live for eternity) and
the Gods have always wished to
live as man because when life
is limited – life is sweeter. And I
am confident to say that Anthony
lived a life so full - that the Gods
would indeed be jealous.
I like to imagine Anthony, the
genius and cheeky character that
he was, as having figured out the
secret – cheated life and skipped
to the ending, forever living in the
heavens above as the hyperac-
tive 18 year old, full of energy
and mobility... whilst for the rest
of us – we will reach heaven in
old age, barely walking... so let
the sadness go as once again, I
he has figured it out and is one
step ahead of us :)
Imperial mourns death of Anthony Soh
Friends hold memorial service in memory of ‘bright and ambitious’ first year
Jeff Soh remembers his
‘passionate’ brother
Friends of first year Mechanical Engi-
neering student Yen Soh, also known as
Anthony, laid flowers at the Serpentine
last Thursday in his memory. His pass-
ing during the Easter holidays shocked
Imperial’s community.
The laying of flowers followed a me-
morial event in the Mechanical Engi-
neering building, during which friends
read eulogies to him and recited the
poem “Death is nothing at all” by Henry
Scott Holland.
He originally went missing on the
22nd of March after leaving Imperial
College Union at around 11pm, after
a night drinking with his friends. He
was last seen turning into Kensing-
ton Gore and it was speculated that he
had headed through Hyde Park back
to Wilson House, his hall of residence.
His disappearance sparked a massive
response online, with over 3000 people
on Facebook raising awareness about
his disappearance and volunteering to
help find him. Search parties were or-
ganised and his brother, friends from
home and Imperial, and even students
who didn’t know him directly, roamed
South Kensington and Bayswater put-
ting up posters asking for information
about his whereabouts.
The police, who searched the Serpen-
tine without success for four days fol-
lowing his disappearance, launched a
missing persons investigation. Sadly,
however, on the 6th of April, he was
found in the Serpentine by a boat worker.
The coroner found no external or inter-
nal injuries, or any water in his lungs and
said that he had died from sudden cold
water immersion, in the sense that the
shock of the cold water stopped his heart.
His brother, Jeff Soh, described him
as “full of energy and excitement” and
“a friendly character [who] was able to
get on with everyone.”
Anthony will be remembered fondly
as an intelligent and popular student.
Facebook was flooded with messages of
condolence on the Facebook page: ‘Rest
In Peace Anthony Soh’ and others.
Dr Michael Bluck, Lecturer in the
Department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing and Hall Warden at Wilson House,
which was Anthony’s student hall, told
Imperial’s Reporter: “Anthony was a
very popular resident of Wilson House
and his many friends will miss him
dearly. He was well known for his effer-
vescent nature and was always around if
there was fun to be had. Anthony had a
sharp technical mind, was a bright and
diligent student of the Mechanical En-
gineering department, and had already
shown great promise.”
