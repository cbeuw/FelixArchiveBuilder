MECH ENG BLUNDER
£3 million exhaust system built with wrong type
of steel; responsibility for error undetermined
A team of technical experts is currently
investigating how a £3 million exhaust
system, in the Mechanical Engineering
building, came to be built with galvan-
ised, instead of stainless steel. The Col-
lege were reluctant to reveal the cost
of fixing the error, saying only that it
was less than half of the original cost,
meaning that whichever party is found
liable could face a bill of up to £1.5
million.
The heavy-gauge exhaust system is
supposed to ventilate toxic gases from
engine test labs to the roof, and is part
of a wider £13.5 million refurbishment
of Mech Eng being carried out by the
construction firm ISG.
The refurbishment was originally
planned to have been completed in
October 2010 but has faced delays and
rising costs due to the exhaust system
mistake and other additional work. The
refurbishment is now intended to finish
in the summer.
Steve Howe, Director of Capital Proj-
ects and Planning, said that when the
mistake was discovered, “it was felt that
[the exhaust system] wouldn’t stand up
to long-term use”. He emphasised that
the liability for the mistake was still
unknown and didn’t rule out the possi-
bility that Imperial would have to meet
some of the extra costs.
He said that other work, in addition
to the original £13.5 million contract,
was also ongoing and said that the final
cost of the refurbishment was still to be
agreed.
ISG did not respond to a request for
comment.
