flashing character labels upon the intro-
duction of each character, I really can’t
think of a way to familiarize the charac-
ters to a new audience effectively. The
filmmakers of Game of Thrones wisely
picked artistic integrity by opting to
reveal characters by slowly trickling
down the identities as the story unfolds.
Importantly the TV version stayed
faithful to the books. Story and charac-
ters are all as they are in the book (at
least till now). The more adult themes
of the story- the incest and the sex -are
undiluted. HBO has its experience with
sex and nudity in Rome and its great to
see that they did not shy away from it
in Game of Thrones. Some reviewers
complain about the excessive nudity
in the show. However I think its great
that those scenes were done with no
punches held, not just because I’m a
guy, but because it is the way the book
was written and they are pivotal to the
characterization and plot. The example
of The Golden Compass, where the re-
ligious theme is watered down to cater
to US audience, testifies that compro-
mising the central elements of a story
in the name of political correctness or
mass appeal results in a film that is but
a lame shadow of its source book. It
now remains to see if HBO would stay
true to the goriness of key events in the
book. In the two episodes shown so
far, the amount of blood spilled seems
promising.
A Game of Thrones is a captivating
read for its spectacular world, charac-
ter and politics. HBO seems to have
got it right, and hopefully, as Game of
Thrones unfold, it would captivate its
audience as the book does. It’s a
high call for a series of books
written by an author hailed
as ‘the American
Tolkien’, but if
Peter Jackson
could do it,
those guys
at HBO (Be-
nioff and

b e t t e r
do it as
well!
Swords, incest, blood and babes
behold. The castles, the medieval stone
rooms, the busy, muddy courtyard, all
brought to life in an opulent and de-
tailed set. The CGI panorama of King’s
Landing is stunning as well. It all feels
like a movie!
Most of the characters were done to
satisfaction. Sean Bean plays a wonder-
ful Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell, while
Mark Addy excels as King Baratheon,
a bashful and merry spirit trapped be-
neath the responsibilities of govern-
ing a kingdom. Lena Headey graces
the screen as the cold-hearted, darkly
ambitious Queen Cersei Lannister and
Emilia Clarke bares all and yet retains a
helplessness and innocence as Daenerys
Targaryen, who would be interesting to
watch as she grows to fulfil her destiny.
Harry Lloyd is absolutely irritating as
Viserys Targaryen, the naïvely ambi-
tious older brother of Daenerys, which
is how the character is supposed to be
as par the novel.
The TV series do fall short on the
character development section. But
what could we expect, the TV show is
already condensing so much content
into ten 1-hour episodes. Some part
may be a bit hasty, but generally, the
show’s pace is all right. Its already an
achievement for the show to circum-
vent with some success what could be
considered the sole flaw of the book,
more of a necessity rather than a flaw
in writing: the first 50 pages are a
bit of a drag, because there are
so many characters to introduce,
nothing much happens! But it’s
essential in order to populate the
stage with such a large cast and
to lay the ground for such an
elaborate plot.
While fans of the book
watch with glee as each of
George R. R. Martin’s cre-
ations are brought to life
in the TV show, those
who have not read the
books might struggle
to keep up with who’s
who in the enormous
cast of characters.
Show, not tell, goes
the adage for good
scriptwriting, but
it is a dilemma
when you have
such a vast
number of
protagonists.
Short of
last 3 on its way) into a trilogy would
require cuts so deep it makes austerity
Britain seem generous! How about one
movie per book, ala Harry Potter? With
the staggering cast of protagonists and
ultra-complex politics in A Song of Ice
and Fire, to make a movie out of just
one of the book would abridge the story
into such simplicity it loses its essence.
Unless of course each movie is a 6-hour
long epic film, which I wouldn’t not
mind sitting through, although I am not
sure if the rest of the people who have
yet to read the books share my senti-
ment. Anyway the TV series would be
made by HBO, who churned out TV
greats like The Sopranos, Boardwalk
Empire and the wire.
After watching the first two episodes
of Game of Thrones, I am of opinion
that the TV series is set for an epic win.
The CGI and set is good enough to
transport the audience into a believ-
able fantasy world, and is stunning to
was disappointing.
However, during the build-up to the
release of the first episode, I realized
that being made into a TV series may
actually do the books better justice than
a film trilogy. To think of it, the first
book itself (A Game of Thrones) is as
thick as all three Lord of the Rings put
together. Hollywood cut out a substan-
tial amount of content to fit LOTR into
a trilogy. To fit the whole of the Song
of Ice and Fire series (7 books, with the
A
few years ago, picking
up ‘A Game of Thrones’
started a love affair that
kept me up through the
deep hours of midnight,
and ended 5000 pages and 4 books lat-
er. I was swept away into the world of
Westeros George R. R. Martin created
and was entangled in the intricate plots
and characters that the story is lived
through.
A Game of Thrones is the first
book in the epic fantasy series that
is A Song of Ice and Fire, which fol-
lows the struggle for the Iron Throne
of the Seven Kingdoms, set against a
backdrop of political conspiracy, war-
ring Houses and incest. The death of
the King’s Hand (the Prime Minister)
triggers a cascade of events that would
usher the end of the peaceful era, and
threaten House Baratheon’s place on
the Iron Throne. Across the Narrow
Sea, the last two remaining bloodline
from the deposed House Targaryen
are now of age and plot to return to
the Seven Kingdoms with vengeance
to seize the throne they believe to be
rightfully theirs.
A Song of Ice and Fire is no doubt
one of the most captivating epic fantasy
series of our generation: it weaves a co-
lourful cast of characters, a complex,
mind-boggling plot that never cease to
conjure up new surprises, and a highly
sophisticated world and its equally intri-
cate politics, altogether in a trademark
dark realism: people die in this story
and the fact that you are a main charac-
ter does not spare your head at crucial
moments. It was one of those books that
is good enough to make you feel as if
reality (a.k.a. moments spent not read-
ing the book) is an aching dream and the
real world is whenever you get back to
reading the book.
So it is to some disappointment initial-
ly when I heard that A Game of Thrones
would be made into a TV series. Where
is the honour of being translated into
the silver screen in an epic 400- million
dollar trilogy that was bestowed to the
reigning fantasy book of the last gen-
eration? I won’t be able to witness the
glory of Winterfell and King’s Landing
and watch the battles unfold in Dolby
Surround Sound and 3D? Damn that
I’d love to hold onto that flowing mane and ride her all day... what? I’m
talking about the horse, you dirty so-and-so!
