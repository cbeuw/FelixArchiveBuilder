With all the excitement of Varsity out
the way, with the BUCS season finished,
and with no fixtures left until October,
it’s about time that Medics Netball had
some of the limelight.
Netball is one of those sports that lots
of boys claim not to like, mostly be-
cause they don’t understand it. Despite
not being able to run with the ball, net-
ball is an extremely skilful, fast paced
sport. And the Medics happen to be
rather good at it.
This season, the Imperial Medics net-
ball 1st team have played netball three
times a week since the beginning of the
season, almost without fail. That adds
up to in excess of 34 hours of matches.
In that time, we’ve scored more than
1400 goals. That’s more than a goal
every 90 seconds. And if that doesn’t
make for exciting viewing, I don’t know
what does!
Of those 34 games, we’ve lost only
four. (One of these was started with only
five players (traffic on the way there)
and we only lost by one goal.) If I may
say so myself, that’s pretty impressive!
Last term, the team went to Shef-
field for the BUCS South-East Con-
ference cup final. 128 teams enter this
competition, so even to get this far was
an achievement. Our rivals in the final
were Brighton 1s, whom we had both
lost to and beaten during the season.
This was the first time we’d progressed
so far in this competition; we were the
under-dogs...! People are often fooled
by our team – we often turn up in dribs
and drabs, with mismatching kit and oc-
casionally we have to start with 5 play-
ers. And I think that Brighton might
have fallen for this disguise. We ended
up the proud owners of shiny gold med-
als, having beaten Brighton 41-25.
This season has been one of our most
successful yet. We are the top of the
ULU Premier League; the Manchester
United of netball. (Proud owners of 2
gold medals!) We are also joint top in
our BUCS league. And we’re in the
league second from the top. The Impe-
rial team are in 3B, which is 3 leagues
below us. Incidentally, we also beat the
Imperial team 46-25 at Varsity. Not re-
ally as close a game as they might’ve
hoped... We also got to the final of the
ULU cup and were unlucky to lose what
was a close-match, with the other team
having an 8th player in the form of their
umpire. Though we can’t really com-
plain about another medal, even if it is
silver!
So I just want to thank all of the
girls who’ve been so committed this
year, particularly Cat Atkin, our oh-so-
nearly-a doctor! Playing as much as we
have, and as well as we have, and fitting
in all of the other medical school obli-
gations is tough. I’m the proudest and
most grateful captain ever!

Netball
round up
season
with gold
medal
ward in an attempt to level the score
before half time. They were rewarded
handsomely when Benincasa played a
delightful through ball to Eshun, who
raced onto the pass and delicately lifted
the ball over the UCL keeper’s head
with remarkable calm.
Towards the start of the second half
Imperial looked to lose some of their
early impetus. This changed somewhat
when Hill, forced off by injury, was
replaced by Wilson – an inspired sub-
stitution which restored a good deal of
composure and shape to the Imperial
side. Both teams pressed on, but the two
strongest defences in the league helped
to keep the scores level until the 75th
minute. Imperial were slightly overex-
posed at the back when UCL crafted a
slick move – culminating in a headed
goal for their striker.
Aware that time was running out,
Imperial switched to an aggressive
3-4-3 position. The quality of the Impe-
rial midfield began to show, and when
Weedon played the industrious Robin-
son through on goal in the 86th minute,
he took his chance beautifully – slotting
home to level the scores at 2-2 and spark
mayhem on the touchline. Imperial
were in the ascendancy and, with the
indescribable support of the fans behind
them, dug deep to try and find a win-
ner. Hearts were in mouths when Fryatt
made a desperate goal line clearance,
but Imperial pushed on.
Entering the 93rd minute of the match,
when weary legs were all but resigned
to extra time, Benincasa again played
Eshun through on goal. All present held
their breath as Eshun – 1st XI POTY,
and with more than 50 Imperial goals
under his belt, powered toward goal –
but he made no mistake. Pandemonium
ensued.
Imperial gathered themselves and saw

style, to cap a stunning comeback and
take a 3-2 victory. Not even a misplaced
trophy could dampen the enthusiasm of
the Imperial contingent, who headed
back to South Kensington as champi-
ons.

In the next few
weeks...
I’m not going to lie to you guys,
but it has been a busy Easter!
Sport at Imperial is getting bet-
ter and better every year and as
such, more and more teams are
making it to various BUCS and
ULU finals that all happen after
our last issue of the Spring Term.
If I put everything in this week,
there would be 10 pages of sport,
so keep an eye out, I promise
your report will go in.
