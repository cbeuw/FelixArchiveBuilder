C U L T U R E
Cohen’s last album marks the end
of a legendary career. Filled with
mellifluous lyrics and soul-stirring
music, it has been received with
critical acclaim. Sadly 2016 has
stolen another great, but can an
artist like Cohen ever really leave
us behind?
T
his is not strictly a
review. Given the
circumstances it
can’t be. Instead,
it is a look at how
an album takes on
a new life when its creator
passes away so shortly
after its release – or, more
appropriately, how an album
allows for the continuation
of a life that is no more. If
you read practically any
of the existing reviews for
Leonard Cohen’s now final
LP, You Want It Darker, you’ll
see a string of 4 star, 5 star,
9/10 and ‘A’ reviews. These
have not come about from
a sense of pity on behalf of
the music press – nor could
they, the album was released
over a fortnight before his
sad passing on 7th
November
– but because the album is
quite simply that good.
There’s no mistaking
Cohen’s age on You Want
It Darker. Reaching his 82nd
year during the recording
process, his voice has per-
manently dropped an octave
or two since his debut in the
60s. But in alignment with his
previous works, the poetry,
the religious overtones, and
most importantly, the humour
remain. It’s easy to miss
behind the melancholy of the
music that Cohen has deliv-
ered over the last 5 decades,
but his dry wit is what sets him
apart from the majority of his
contemporaries: “I heard the
snake was baffled by his sin,
he shed his skin to find the
snake within”, “I struggled
with some demons, they were
middle class and tame”. It’s
not laugh out loud like a
Randy Newman song, but
upon reflection you can spot
the nods and winks laying
within the harrowing subject
matter. On a side note, Is This
What You Wanted is perhaps
the best example of the juxta-
position of pain and humour
in Cohen’s career. Away from
Leonard’s own performance,
the instrumentation on You
Want it Darker is second
to none. From the driving
baseline of the album’s title
track, to the surf-rock guitar
of Leaving the Table, and the
devastatingly beautiful strings
near the album’s end, Cohen,
his son Adam, and Patrick
Leonard are to be com-
mended for the production
across the 35 minute run time.
Not forgetting, of course, the
female backing vocalists, a
constant in Cohen’s music as
much as the wit, but who take
on a new life when heard
alongside the now deeper
voice of the Canadian singer.
You Want it Darker is
the third studio album to
be released by Cohen
since 2012, Old Ideas and
Popular Problems being the
predecessors, a prolific streak
accompanied by relatively
consistent touring since 2008.
Much of this, it is speculated,
is down to money problems.
In 1994 Cohen had all but
retired from music; the singer
moved to the Mt. Baldy Zen
Centre, a Buddhist Monastery
in the Californian Mountains,
to the West of Los Angeles.
enjoyed his return to musical
relevance so much that they
continued well beyond the
point of necessity. What
was so remarkable about
this return to song writing,
however, is not how it came
about, but that the resulting
music was so great. Many an
artist has delved back into the
studio after a long period of
musical silence, lured by the
promise of rekindled wealth,
only to produce frankly dire
and sickeningly nostalgic
albums. Unlike most, Cohen
entered a completely new
artistic period in his career,
which was received with
acclaim from fans and critics
alike. A dazzling climax for
one of modern music’s great
heroes.
Much was made in January
of this year at the poignancy
and beauty of David Bowie’s
Blackstar – he knew his death
was upon him, and his lyrics
and music reflected that in
a devastatingly wonderful
manner. Comparisons of
Cohen’s and Bowie’s final
releases are inevitable –
both men lost their lives to
cancer. What sets the events
surrounding You Want It
Darker apart from Blackstar,
however, is the time between
album release and artist’s
death. For Bowie, this was just
two days, while for Cohen,
over two weeks. Reviews
of Blackstar were thus rife
with analysis of Bowie’s last
hurrah. With You Want It
Darker, there was time to
assimilate and see an album
beyond just a swansong. On
the face of it, the album is a
collection of love songs, a lost
love, a love that keeps the
world from going cold, and
of a love for our protagonist’s
saviour (Treaty, If I Didn’t
Have Your Love, and Travel-
ling Light, in that order).
Of course, from this week
all of that has changed. For
