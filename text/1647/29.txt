for improvement but they
should be buoyed by great
performances against two
second teams.
The whole club can be
proud of what they have
achieved, and the men are
looking forward to nationals
in February. Meanwhile we
send our best wishes to the
women competing in their
regionals this weekend.
T
he indoor frisbee
season has well
and truly got
underway, and
the Imperial disc
Doctors (dD) were
able to send three teams to
the men’s indoor regionals,
one of only two teams in the
region to be able to do so.
Having won this competition
last year, expectations were
high, but the team wanted to
take a steady approach for
continued success.
The first few games
for the 1st
team were
straightforward, generally
playing lower-ability teams.
There was one must-win
game against an under
seeded UEA 1s side; a
loss here would’ve put the
tournament win out of reach.
dD were definitely up for
this and came out strong
to go 3-0 up, a lead that
they would hold, eventually
winning 7-3.
Sunday saw the team finish
the group stages beating
Cambridge 2s 8-2. Next
was a semi-final against
Cambridge 1s, a fixture with
some history after we broke
their winning streak last
year. dD came out strong
as usual and won a place in
the final against St Mary’s,
a one dimensional team
with several tall receivers.
Once again, dD came out
with a great defensive setup
to put pressure on those
long throws and competed
well in the air. Despite
falling behind early on,
dD’s patience and clinical
offence saw them through
to win the final 7-5, with a
Callahan (Ultimate Frisbee’s
equivalent of an own-goal)
to secure the game.
dD 2s had a mixed pool
with two 1st
teams and two
fairly even 2nd
teams. They
were able to see off both
of the second teams in
their group to hold seed,
including not conceding in
an 8-0 victory over UCL.
This placed them in the 9-16
bracket in which they fought
well and had a noticeable
victory beating Cambridge
2s, a satisfying repeat of
mixed regionals two weeks
ago.
dD 3s had a relatively
difficult group, where they
were both learning to play
as a team and playing
tough opposition. They were
noticeably growing as a
unit throughout their fixtures
and were able to compete
well in the round robin and
even though they beat both
Hertfordshire and UCL
2s, they were only able to
finish 20th
(out of 22). Room

omething big
went down
this weekend:
25 of Imperial
Snowsports’
finest and loosest
made the annual pilgrimage
to BUDS, a massive national
surface he is completely
unfamiliar with. Kerchove
has well and truly cemented
IC’s place on the university
snowsports map and as our
Hero.
Naturally, amongst the
aforementioned huge nights
was the BUDS ball. Donning
our sexiest suits, all 2,000 hit
up one of Edinburgh’s finest
dining establishments to enjoy
some mountain raclette and
cheese cake. This, of course,
descended into yet another
unforgettable night to round
off what will go down in his-
tory as one of ICSC’s greatest
weekends.
It was an all round great
weekend watching the best
racers and freestylers from
all over the country smashing
their competitions in the day,
and then taking to Edinburgh
at night to celebrate.
Thank you to everyone who
came for a lovely game of
BUDS. To everyone else, you
can still get in on the fun,
we’ve got spaces left on our
Christmas ski trip. This year
we’re heading to the world
renowned Val Thorens in the
French Alps from the 16th
to
the 24th
of December for the
low base price of £399. If you

snowsports competition just
outside Edinburgh. To put
it simply, it was seriously
incredible.
Starting and ending with a
charming coach trip with our
snow–loving buddies from
Middlesex, Kings and Queen
Mary, the weekend was truly
huge. Each day, following
some of the best nights of our
entire lives with 2,000 other
snowsports students from all
over the UK, we’d smash a
Wetherspoons fry-up then
head off to the dry slope to
cheer on our champions.
The highlight was ERAS-
MUS legend Tristan de
Kerchove progressing to the
freestyle semi finals as he
threw some unreal tricks,
including the infamous ‘Cork
7’. This is an unbelievable
achievement considering
it was on the dry slope, a
