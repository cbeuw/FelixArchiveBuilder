CANCER
VIRGO
This week you do
an unintentional
#MannequinChallenge
in the middle of your
lecture. You lay down
motionless for a whole
two hours. Sports night
hit you hard.
LEO
PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO
LIBRA
GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you
decide to listen to
the messages your
body is telling you.
Unfortunately those
messages are just to
eat more doughnuts.
This month you will
feel a weird sense of
existential dread. This is
not a joke.
This week you crack
and decide you’ve had
enough of your course.
Simple solution, go
on a spontaneous
getaway somewhere.
Simple problem,
you’ve only enough
money to get you to
zone three.
This week you win the
lottery. You still can’t
afford to put the heating
on.
This week Mercury is
in retrograde, making
you lazy, angry and
even worse at cleaning.
Your housemates
will not understand
and simply call you
lazy. BUT THEY’RE
WRONG BECAUSE
HOROSCOPES ARE
REAL.
This week you bench
140 kg so you reward
with steroids injections
before being creepy at
a club. Good work brah
your not very in tune with
the felix brand but we
love you in our own weird
way.
This week you read
the Union’s NSS
recommendations and
are hopeful that change
is round the corner.
Then you remember that
Imperial is apathetic and
only ever cared about
the library heating.
#Occupy4thFloor
This week after
meeting the boy of
your dreams, you start
to get this warm feeling
that just won’t cease;
however, after it starts
to get painful you
realise it was actually
just appendicitis.
This week you buy the
new $200 book filled
with just Apple products.
No words. Just pictures.
Still better value than
half your course
textbooks.
This week you’re
subjected to a set of
initiations for your sports
club. Mentally intense,
physically draining and
requiring lots of alcohol to
complete, your degree was
perfect training.
This week you’re
still reeling after the
US election and the
imminent apocalypse.
You bulk buy tinned
goods. Not because it’s
the end of the world,
mind you, because it’s
great value.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I wonder if you could help me. I’ve got really dry skin but
I don’t feel comfortable using moisturiser. It always smells
like flowers or fruit and I’m just not into smelling like a girl.
What can I do? My painful knees and elbows are really
getting in the way of playing rugby and downing pints,
while the blood from my knuckles is getting all over the
planks of wood I’ve chopped to construct shelves. What
can I do?
Yours,
Ash E.
HOROSCOPES
Hey Ash!
I know that moisturiser and grooming is for
women. A true man should never care how he
is presenting himself, it’s how much destruction
you leave in your path that counts. Although,
since it seems to be getting in the way of your
manly duties, I guess I should help you out.
Your first option is using moisturiser formulated
‘For Men’. This is a bit of an oxymoron, but
some people understand your struggle – Bull-
dog is my favourite. You don’t have to stoop to
the levels of a cream, you have the follow-
ing options: Kiehl’s Facial Fuel*, Nivea Men
Express Absorption Revitalising Lotion*, Loreal
Paris Expert Hydro Energetic Tattoo Lotion*.
Also available is Max LS Power V Lifting
Cream* – yes, this is a cream, but is accept-
able since it sounds like you could drive it on
Top Gear. (If it doesn’t sound like it would fit in
a garage, you will grow breasts.) If you’re on
a budget, or don’t want to tread into Women’s
territory to procure your solution, the following
options can be found in your Man Drawer. You
could try blood or sweat (no tears, obviously).
Alternatively, you could try spit, or another
certain manly bodily fluid. From your truck or
motorbike, you can find grease or petrol. You
mentioned you have some DIY projects going;
you could use Drywall (before it dries). You
also get your fix as you snack with chip fat. If it
burns your skin, you’re doing it right!
You could just deal, suck it up and be a man.
Big luv,
Chris xxxxx
*felix can confirm these are all actually
available
