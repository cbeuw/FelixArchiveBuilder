ames Joyce was a
modernist master
with game-changing
style, literary gonads
the size of Dublin
and –quite literally–
Homeric ambition. Few
writers can boast of having
drunk with Hemingway, dined
with Picasso, and picked
a quarrel with Proust. His
influence reaches far and
wide: people have named
everything from rock bands to
subatomic particles after his
writing. Joyce was something
of an enigmatic figure (his last
words were “Does nobody
understand?”), and the only
thing more inscrutable than
the man himself was his
work. Ulysses was banned
for a long time in most of
the English-speaking world
before being named by
critical consensus as "the
most important novel in the
English language". Finnegans
Wake, his masterpiece that
took seventeen years to write,
has been called "the most
colossal leg-pull in literature",
and has even been compared
to Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Dubliners, his collection
of fifteen short stories, is a
pioneering work of modern-
ism. Quietly innovative, the
collection redefined how
stories could be told. In it,
nationalism and naturalism
blend; instead of a conven-
tional beginning in the thick
of it, the stories start long
before the action; the climax,
rather than a final act of
showdown in blazing gunfire
is in internal 'epiphany'. The
tension and emotion in these
small moments of quiet inspec-
tion deliver an emotional gut
punch that lingers long after
the reader has put down the
book. The stories are about
the largely unremarkable
day-to-day lives of the Irish
middle class, but despite the
banal subject matter, the
writing makes Dubliners one
of the powerful, and poign-
ant works of literature ever

written. Araby, one of the
most readable stories in the
collection, is a simple tale of
a boy who is infatuated with a
beautiful but inaccessible girl.
Filled with a sense of chivalry
and honour, he idolises her as
a goddess. Hoping to win her
love with a gift, overcoming
the obstacles thrown his way,
he travels to the exotic, far-
away bazaar, Araby. When
he arrives, it’s too late; the
bazaar has closed. Alone,
our protagonist becomes
overwhelmed by a sense of
the futility of his endeavour.
The bubble has been burst.
Why is he here? What silly
romantic idea has driven him
to such a pointless journey?
The story ends in this moment
of disillusionment.
If it feels like I have given
away the plot, worry not.
Joyce’s stories are not about
the plot, and the climaxes are
not about such-and-such hap-
pening, rather, they are about
nothing happening, about
being stopped in one’s tracks
in a way that only sudden
inaction can bring about.
There is no flashy twist-end-
ing, rather, it is almost as
if the characters suddenly
realise they are mere autom-
atons written into a story,
and all their motivations and
drives are devoid of any real
meaning. It’s a feeling that
plagues every one of us now
and then, and I feel Joyce
taps into this ubiquitous but

oft-neglected emotion with
greatest accuracy. Very few
writers use characters in a
story to relate to our own
sense of being a character in
a story.
In nearly every story in
Dubliners, the main charac-
ter undergoes an epiphany
of some sort; taking various
forms – guilt, embarrassment,
disillusionment, disenchant-
ment, frustration, or sheer
despondency. The writing is
not tragic but melancholic;
with this bittersweet, sheer
shadow of an emotion, Joyce
explores the full range of
human feeling. Literature has
given us much of the heroic
and the tragic, the comic
and the joyous. Joyce lets
us sink into those delicate

in-betweens, those numer-
ous shades of grey that live
in-between the black and the
white.
Joyce is the master of the
subtle understatement. This
is something much needed in
today’s age of hyperbolic,
bombastic Trumpian rhetoric.
In a world where platitudes
are strewn left, right and
centre (mostly right), where
everything is “tremendous”,
“huge” or “amazing”, I miss
Joycean restraint.
Dubliners is actually rather
decent.
