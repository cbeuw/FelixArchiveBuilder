eleased just two
days after the US
election result,
the cynical tone
and pertinent
observations
throughout the album are
a cutting backlash to the
uprising of hate in America
that accompanied Trump’s
success. In signature style, the
bars deviate from predictable
ultra-masculine, gangsta
rap themes and instead
philosophise on cultural
identity, race and America.
Before the new release had
been announced, Phife
Dawg, who formed ATQC
with his classmates, died of
complications from diabetes,
aged just 45. The remaining
members continued the
project in tribute, with Q-Tip
stating this would be their
last album. ATCQ have been
praised for the infectious
optimism that characterises
their hits, We got it from
Here… Thank You 4 Your
service maintains this, but the
lyrics are understandably
darker. The second track,
We The People, begins with
alarms sounding and later
features police sirens as Q-Tip
recites a Trump-style mantra:
“All you black folks, you must
go / All you Mexicans you
must go / And all you poor
folks, you must go / Muslims
and gays, boy, we hate your
ways”. Kanye West features
on The Killing Season, which
relates the assassination of
black political leaders and
police brutality to the hyper-
militarised US. Jarobi goes on
to contemplate the evolution
crime is having melanin”. The
album’s production shows a
finesse that comes from the
collaborative style; Moving
Backwards juxtaposes
Anderson Paak’s soulful
voice with scathing bars from
Jarobi and Q-Tip addressing
the regressive attitudes of the
police: “Thorns in the crown
hit the cross I bear / Why
they wanna see me hangin’
like a towel somewhere”.
Rarely do we get to hear
an album featuring so many
icons, including Elton John,
Kendrick Lamar, André
3000, and Kanye West, but
such is the admiration in the
industry for ATCQ. We got
it from Here… Thank You 4
Your Service is a masterful
commentary on race in 21st
century America.

being an exception). This is
even despite Cohen spelling
his fate out to us all, without
any lyrical metaphors, back
in July. His most famous muse,
Marianne Ihlen, passed away
at 81 on 29th
July this year.
Before she died, Cohen sent a
letter to his dear friend: “Well
Marianne, it’s come to this
time when we are really so
old and our bodies are falling
apart and I think I will follow
you very soon. Know that I
am so close behind you that
if you stretch out your hand,
I think you can reach mine”.
Even when accepting his own
demise, poetry does not fail
him.
The final track on You Want
It Darker is the most poetic
of all. Strong Reprise/Treaty
opens with a string version
of the piano melody from the
album’s second track, Treaty.
Yet Cohen’s voice and lyrics –
the defining aspects of a now
completed discography – are
nowhere to be heard. The
strings continue, but Cohen
does not. Time has at last
caught up and the singer
is silent. And then, with but
seconds left, he bids his last
goodbye.
“I wish there was a treaty
we could sign / It’s over now,
the water and the wine / We
were broken then but now
we’re borderline / And I wish
there was a treaty, I wish
there was a treaty between
your love and mine.”
Leonard Cohen the man is
now, sadly, dead. Leonard
Cohen the singer, poet,
lyricist, guitar player, and
musician – whose influence
and impact is unquantifiable
– lives on.
swansong will be heard from

Hineni. I’m ready, my Lord”
(‘Hineni’, from the Torah, and
Hebrew for ‘Here I am’), “I’m
leaving the table, I’m out of
the game”, “I’m travelling
light, it’s au revoir” paint a
picture as clear as day, of a
man on the edge of passing.
Perhaps it’s denial, or simply
to avoid being rude, but
few predicted this would
be Cohen’s last album (Will
