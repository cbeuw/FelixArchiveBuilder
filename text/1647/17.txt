n 1976, tongue firmly in
cheek, social scientists
Deborah David, and
Robert Brannon, outlined
the four tenets of
American masculinity;
“no sissy stuff”, “be a big
wheel”, “be a sturdy oak”,
and “give em hell”. The
terms might be joking; the
principles behind them are
not; emotional constipation,
testosterone fuelled posturing,
and (violent) aggression form
the basis of what sociologists
call "hegemonic masculinity",
in other words, the socially
acceptable heteromasculinity
of gunslinging cowboys from
mid century Westerns. Male
ballet dancers do not easily
fit into this narrative, whether
they have ripped abs or not.
Ballet, in the eyes of many
has resolutely fallen into
the category of “sissy stuff”;
"prancing princes" is how the
critic Andrew Bland described
classical male dancers in
1960. Sadly, the dogwhistle
homophobia in Bland’s term
and ones like it have not
stayed relegated to the 60s.
In 2003, a sociological study
of male ballet dancers found
that homophobic slurs were
still used to describe male
dancers and their work. The
almost superhuman athletic
feats that might’ve earned
this cohort of real life Billy
Elliots acclaim from the Reddit
crowd had they taken place
on a field, or a track, become
the focus of derision when
they take place on stage.
Why is this the case? Some
have argued that while
conventional athletics is
about action to achieve a
goal, dance is action for it’s
own sake, for the sake of
being seen. To be on display,
to become an object of the
female gaze is a threat to the
conventional ideas of mascu-
linity. For some, women are
much more suited to the role
of object; it’s no coincidence
that figures in music-boxes,
tiny figures spinning on cue
are cast as ballerinas. These
presumptions on a woman’s
ability disregards the blood
and sweat that make up the
performances of real life bal-
lerinas, in favour of the tautly
held postures, and the tulle
of their tutus. How to fit men
into this narrative though?
Throughout history, male
dancers have been under
pressure to embrace effemi-
nacy (and to some degree the
assumption of homosexuality
that comes along with this) or
utterly reject it in a display of
over the top machismo.
Matthew Bourne’s Swan
Lake attempts to subverts
expectations to encompass
flapping their arms menac-
ingly trying to intimidate each
other rather than performing
in harmony. This is a display
of hegemonic masculinity, of
power, not aestheticism. The
movements are exaggerated,
discordant with the familiar
music, it’s meant to be at
least a little funny - a send up
of how gung-ho masculinity
looks in this scenario.
It would’ve been easy for
the whole production to
descend into parody, but
Bourne’s Swan Lake remains
a story of tortured love.
The prince is revealed to be
closeted, visions of men haunt
him; in the opening scene, he
starts awake from a dream
about a strangely alluring
man. Later on in the first act,
on a night out in a club full of
sailors, the prince’s dances,
thus far subdued, become
sexually charged. It is not
meant to be; the night ends in
a physical altercation which
leaves Siegfied bruised and
bloody on the pavement. He
is rebuffed by his mother, and
the woman he was seeing
is revealed to be on the
payroll of the evil Secretary
who is seeking influence at
the palace. Despondent,

both. In the original Swan
Lake, a Tchaikovsky classic,
Siegfried, a prince who is
being married off by the
Queen against his will, falls
in love with Odette, a girl
who is cursed to be a swan
by day. Only true love will
lift the curse cast by the evil
Von Rothbart. Swan Lake is
one of the few ballets that
have taken root in the public
consciousness. Rarely do new
directors attempt any sort of
major revision to the tried and
tested format of the 19th
cen-
tury original. It was perhaps
Matthew Bourne’s inexperi-
ence with ballet that allowed
him the boldness to reimagine
Swan Lake as a love story
between two male leads.
In the Bourne staging, first
performed in 1995 in Sadler’s
Wells, the swans, traditionally
a corps of female dancers
are replaced by bare chested
male dancers in feathered
hose, faces done up in
war-paint like black make
up. Bourne has said he was
inspired by the "aggressive,
muscular" side of swans; the
viciousness that belie their
serene exteriors. One of the
most iconic sequences from
the original is the dance of
the little swans. In this pas
de quatre, four (female)
dancers, arms linked, perform
a piece of devilishly difficult
synchronised choreography.
In the Bourne version, the
performance sheds its veneer
of order; instead of restrained
steps in synch, the danc-
ers perform daring leaps,
the prince stumbles into a
deserted park, where he
meets the Swan King.
The performance by the
dancer in the role of the Swan
King is by turns menacing
and sensual. He radiates a
certain wildness in his solo
performances. However, the
pas de deux between the
prince and the Swan King
are tender, loving. If the
dance of the little swans is
played for laughs, this central
relationship is thankfully,
not. Matthew Bourne has
said depicting a romantic
relationship between the
Swan King and the prince
was not his ‘explicit intention’,
but the homoeroticism is fairly
evident. In this production,
the characterisation of male
ballet dancers comes full
circle; rather than reject-
ing the associations with
homosexuality, Swan Lake
reclaims it. In doing so, it
creates a far richer, far truer,
and most importantly, a far
more interesting depiction of
masculinity.

A
s Oreste
started, I
thought for
a fleeting
moment that
I was in the
wrong place. Had I gotten
lost among the twisting
alleyways of East London?
Why was a mascara-streaked,
hammer-wielding teenage girl
butchering a hapless prisoner
on stage?
Then the orchestra struck
up the opening chords, and
I realised that said girl was
meant to be Ifigenia. In
Handel’s original (though
original is a bit of a misnomer,
Oreste is a pastiche of music
cobbled together from earlier
works), Ifigenia is the unwill-
ing priestess of Diana on the
island of Tauris, forced to
ritually sacrifice all those who
land on King Toante’s shores.
Her long-estranged brother
Oreste, driven mad by the
Furies for murdering his
mother, wanders the world in
search of relief and is washed
up on Tauris. Ifigenia tries
to help him escape from the
island with the aid of Filotete
– the captain of the guards
who has fallen in love with
her. This plan is complicated
by the capture of Oreste’s
wife Ermione, and his faithful
friend Pilade who have come
to Tauris in search of him.
Before I had quite recov-
ered from the initial shock of
seeing the temple of Diana
represented by a slaugh-
terhouse (complete with a
generous splash of blood
from the latest sacrificial
victim), Oreste himself shuf-
fled into view. Dressed in
tatty pyjamas and picking
vacantly at his shirt hem, he
looked more an escapee from
a mental asylum than the tor-
tured “man of noble descent”
that Ifigenia proclaimed him
to be. But then he opened his
mouth to sing, and what a
contrast! On that gritty, graffi-
ti-ridden stage, after the gore
and horror of the opening
scenes, Angela Simkin’s voice
was unexpectedly beautiful.
The more I watched, the
more mystified I became.
Director Gerard Jones’
production of Oreste is
intentionally ugly and
stripped-down, devoid of the
niceties of classicalism. There
is nothing sacred about ritual
sacrifice in Jones’ vision of
Tauris – only madness and
horror. I soon came to the
conclusion that everyone
was insane; except perhaps
Pilade, a lone figure of nor-
malcy in a cast of deranged
characters.
Despite my preference for a
classical style, the moder-
nity of the production was
not what perturbed me. As
a Beckett-esque absurdist
theatre unfolded on stage, the
soaring notes and romantic
lyrics seemed to be from a dif-
ferent production entirely. “O

fairest eyes of my beloved…
For you I shall suffer the joys
and ills of Fate!” – How could
I believe that, coming from a
slavering Filotete who leered
after Ifigenia at every oppor-
tunity? Jones might have been
going for dissonance, but it
just did not work.
Oreste is a long, three-act
opera, and the ROH made
the unfortunate decision to
run the first two acts together.
By the end of the second act,
I had grown quite weary of
the characters. Nothing made
any sense. Vacuous, twitchy
Oreste failed to inspire in me
any admiration or reason
to believe why the other
characters were so willing to
lay down their lives for him.
When the reunited Oreste
and Ermione sang their
passionate “Ah mia cara”
duet at each other with an
utter lack of emotion, it was
just too much. I closed my
eyes. That certainly improved
the performance; the lovely
voices of Angela Simkin and
Vlada Borovko carried me

away.
At least the denouement,
with its final twist, managed
to explain the peculiar actions
of the characters in the first
two acts – but the belated
realisation that it was all
intentional was too little, too
late. Hilariously, Pilade gave
up on the lunacy surrounding
him, donned his lifejacket and
slipped quietly away in the
last scene. Presumably he was
off to a saner island.
Despite the somewhat
misguided production, the
talent of the singers managed
to shine through. Oreste is the
ROH’s annual production of
the Jette Parker Young Artists
programme, and there was
no small amount of talent
showcased on stage that
night. Angela Simkin (Oreste)

stood out for me especially,
accompanied by the very
competent Southbank Sinfo-
nia under conductor James
Hendry.
If Gerard Jones is aiming to
shock audiences with his post-
modern production of Oreste,
he certainly managed to do
so. I’m not very sure what else
he managed to achieve.
