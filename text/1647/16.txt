or a form of music
so deeply rooted
in a culture of
self-certainty and
dazzling bravado,
you might not
expect artists of the genre
to be tackling sensitive
issues relating to isolation,
depression, violence and
substance abuse. This
however, is exactly what
we’ve seen take place with
fresh new artists championing
the cause to give these issues
a well-deserved place in the
spotlight.
The emergence of honest
and introspective rap is
far from a new phenom-
enon; in fact some of our
most celebrated rap artists
including Biggie, Tupac and
Eminem have been known to
rap about the grim realities
of their past with brave
honesty. In Death Around
The Corner Tupac plays the
role of a character living in
a harsh urban wasteland
where the “skinny” people
“die” and where his char-
acter is fixated on “staying
high”. His effort to escape
this numbing habit quickly
spirals into a loss of control,
anxiety and paranoia. He
draws parallels between
himself and his father who
he says was “madder than a
motherfucker”, as he realizes
the hereditary nature of his
tendencies. Artists have since
continued along this stream
of self-reflection and social
commentary but this has often
been paired with equally strik-
ing and blooming confidence,
and a focus on issues that the
artist has overcome, and so
serves as a sign of success
rather than weakness.
Alternatively artists like
Marshall Mathers have indi-
rectly gone about channeling
these thoughts through char-
acters elaborately created
to touch upon whatever is
deemed taboo. This technique
has been employed more
recently by artists such as
Tyler the Creator who plays
Wolf Haley, a balaclava
wearing alter ego with a taste
for “Green paper, gold teeth,
and pregnant gold retrievers”.
Through Wolf he expresses
the darker and more twisted
corners of his imagination,
but never without struggle,
as Tyler retorts with “Fuck
social media labeling them
as “soft” and “lame”. Often
these criticisms have come
from fellow musicians and
prominent members of the
music industry. Incidents like
this remain proof that many
listeners continue to yearn for
the more traditional rhetoric
of success, stories of coping
in the face of adversity and
transforming ones life from
rags to riches.
Mental health and hip
hop have had a difficult
relationship for decades,
with members of the culture
insisting the matter being
a fallacy, or worse, even a
sign of weakness. This had
led to many artists rejecting
collaboration with those keen
to speak out about personal
vulnerabilities, or even worse,
labels refusing to put out
releases where these topics
take center stage. Artists like
Drake have been frequently
mocked for speaking openly
about their feelings of iso-
lation, jealousy, paranoia
and irrationality. Many of
his releases were met with
harsh criticism especially
after recent tensions when
Meek Mill accused Drake
of using ghost writers on his
album. Meek Mill took part
in the back and forth on
social media during which
he attacked Drake saying “I
heard that shit, that shit was
very soft. Baby lotion soft”. In
an environment where hyper
masculinity and self-suffi-
ciency are cherished, writing
emotionally sensitive songs
with the help of ghost writers
often means asking for this
kind of harsh reception. With
this kind of backdrop, recent
efforts by rap artists like
Kendrick Lamar to speak out
about isolation and substance
abuse should be recognized
and credited. In his track
Swimming Pools, Kendrick
speaks about how alcoholism
begins with an attempt “to fit
in the popular” and quickly
spirals into a self-medicated
need to “drown their sor-
rows”. Kendrick even goes
to great lengths discussing
the genetic predisposition
to alcoholism when he raps
about how his “granddaddy
had that golden flask”.
One new artist in particular
who experienced the brunt of
rigid attitudes towards what a
rap artist should or shouldn’t
be is R&B/Soul musician
Frank Ocean, who spoke
very openly about being
gay in the rap industry. In an
interview in 2014, he spoke
about the difficulty getting to
work with other rap artists in
a studio, simply because of
their prejudices towards his
sexual orientation. Nonethe-
less, Frank Ocean was able to
garner a dedicated fan base
with tracks such as Thinkin’
Bout You where he sings;
“My eyes don’t shed tears,
but boy, they bawl when
I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you” – a
subtle nod towards the love
interest he sings about. More

his 2011 track Yonkers.
However despite hip hop
and rap artists giving their
troubled listeners something
and someone to relate to, this
hasn’t come without difficulty
and backlash. Artists like

Cudi have grown accus-
tomed to a storm of critics on

T
his is Peckham
rapper Nathaniel
Thompson’s first
London headline
show, despite
over 10 years
making music. He says he
can’t believe this is finally
here after all the aggro; it’s
been a long time coming.
Commonly known as Giggs,
his accolades include BET
best hip hop artist UK, and
his latest album debuted at
number 2. Previous London
shows are not missing due
to a lack of interest – the
Forum is sold out and the
crowd are enthusiastic.
Upon entry, it is clear that
security is a concern; ticket
holders are subjected to
thorough bag checks and
asked to put all metal objects
in a clear plastic bag, then
waved over with metal
detectors. Inside, security
guards litter the crowd. These
concerns are not just due
to a particularly energetic
mosh pit, but probably due to
Giggs’ past in the Peckham
Boys’ Gang. Having been
sentenced to two years for
firearm possession in 2003,
and arrested again, then
acquitted, on similar charges
in 2012, putting on a London
show has come with some
obstacles. Previous shows
have been cancelled by
the police, most infamously
leading Giggs to upload a
public apology to YouTube in
2013, sarcastically thanking
the police for always slowing
him down.
The show is based heavily
off Giggs’ latest album,
Landlord. The set is impressive
– the front of a block of flats
with dynamic silhouettes in
the windows coordinated to
each track performed. Giggs’
lyrics, delivered by his trade-
mark booming voice, get as
dark and gritty as his subject
matter. Introducing Just
Swervin, he says this is a song
to light up to (but of course,
not in the venue) “I put my
mum through a nightmare
/ But now she don’t check
the news / Because her son
wasn’t out there / I’m in the
house with some houseware”
he raps. Aside from this, the
vibes are celebratory. Crowd
favourites Look What the
Cat Dragged in and Talking
the Hardest have the venue
buzzing – empty cups and
even a tracksuit can be seen
flying up above the moshpit.
The party vibe intensifies with
the arrival of grime royalty
Kano, JME and Skepta.
Iconic performances of 3
Wheel-ups, Man Don’t Care
and It Aint Safe are followed
by Whipping Excursion, the
current single from Landlord.
Giggs is joined on stage by
all performers of the show
for the finale, celebrating as
confetti cannons fire. All in
all, a triumph.

Kentish Town
Try he sings “I believe that
marriage isn’t between a man
and woman, but between
love and love”. Since, Ocean
has received praise for his
musical work and efforts to
challenge the norms within
the inner circle of musicians
and tastemakers.
On Real Friends we hear
Kanye West, a man notorious
of isolation. The track opens
with Kanye asking questions,
which appear to emerge
from a deeply seated anxious
psyche; “Real friends, how
many of us? / How many of
us, how many jealous? / Real
friends / It’s not many of us,
we smile at each other / But
how many honest? / Trust
issues”. In this case what is
being said isn’t particularly
profound no matter how
honest, but what is important
is who appears to be speak-
ing about these issues. For
artists like Kanye West to rap
about his anxieties to the mil-
lions of listeners who tuned in
to the release of Life of Pablo
is a reflection of a time where
that has been deemed more
acceptable and a time where
praise has started to replace
backlash.
On his album To Pimp A
Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar
features a track titled i, where
a percussion heavy 70s
soul groove is paired with a
chorus of voices singing the
lead hook “I love myself / Illu-
minted by the hand of God,
boy don’t be shy / I love
myself / One day at a time”.
Here Kendrick brings some-
thing slightly more refreshing
and previously lacking to
the table. Instead of simply
offering listeners the chance
to relate to his troubles and
struggles, he also offers to
pick them up with a message
on sleeplessness in the digital
age (as on Melatonin), iso-
lation in a hyper-connected
world, racial and political
tensions (The Donald) as well
as dealing with mourning
and death. Throughout the
album, Phife Dawg, Q-Tip,
Ali Shaheed Muhammad and
Jarobi White do what drew
fans to the group in the first
place: delivering an honest
reflection of time we live in
and standing by it. This is
exactly what hip hop and rap
music has always stood for.
Be it good or bad, for better
or for worse, truth and hon-
esty have always held center
stage such for artists of the
genre. And so, with global
shift in attitudes towards
acceptance and diversity
becoming more prominent
and widespread, we can
only expect these genres of
music to be at the forefront of
channeling this progressive
change, with better things to
come for artists and listeners
alike.
