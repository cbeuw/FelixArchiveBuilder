TV mourns for Adonaïs
T
elevision has,
historically
speaking, been a
fairly progressive
medium. Whether
it was Star Trek in
the 60s pushing for minority
rights, or shows like Will &
Grace and Ellen normalising
and publicising LGBT rights
in the 90s, TV has frequently
been willing and capable
to push the envelope. One
of the areas it has perhaps
lagged behind, however, is
in its handling of the male
protagonist.
There tend to be about three
modes for any leading male
characters: the platonic,
wholesome ‘hero’, the gruff
‘anti-hero’, or the squirrelly
‘nerd’. All three hinge on a
limited, traditional idea of
what defines ‘masculinity’
\\ There tend to be
about three modes
for male characters:
the platonic,
wholesome ‘hero’,
the gruff ‘anti-hero’,
or the squirrelly
nerd \\
or, in the case of the third,
the lack thereof. The ‘hero’ is
the oldest of these, the clas-
sical John Wayne-type with
chiselled jaw and chiselled
ethics. The ‘nerd’ is smart but
cowardly, well-meaning but
lacking the courage to stand
up for what he believes in.
The ‘anti-hero’ is perhaps
the most infuriating of the
rejectionist stereotypes, often
squandering the opportu-
nity to examine traditionally
neglected aspects of the
male psyche. Addictions and
mental illnesses are trivial-
ised and turned into purely
cosmetic affectations, while
self-destructive behaviour is
fetishized.
As of late, however, series
have been making efforts
to fully consider the impact
of this mind-set, and various
different shows have begun
considering the traditionally
taboo subject of men’s mental
health. In general, TV has
begun to question its own,
and to an extent society’s
definitions of masculinity.
Shows such as Mad Men,
Bojack Horseman, and Rick
and Morty present incredibly
flawed male protagonists that
might be superficially likened
to ‘anti-heroes’. The difference
here is that an attempt is
made to examine thoroughly
the consequences of and
reasons for their self-destruc-
tive behaviour. In fact, it is a
central theme in both of the
aforementioned series.
Mad Men’s Don Draper
is the quintessential picture
of the ‘ideal man’; suave,
successful, and dapper. Yet
he is also an adulterous wom-
aniser, a worsening alcoholic
and smoker, and running from
his past. None of these things
are glorified here, and are
instead scrutinised. Draper’s
flakiness and constant need
to find new partners is a
consequence of his poor
relationship with his parents
and a result of growing up in
a brothel. His alcoholism is a
dependency.
Similarly, Bojack and Rick
and Morty present aging pro-
tagonists struggling to cope
with their depression. Their
fronts of stoicism are quickly
revealed to be manifesta-
tions of one of the most toxic
aspects of ‘masculinity’: the
reluctance to seek help. Over
the courses of their respective
series, both spiral further into
darkness, all the while retain-
ing a coarse exterior and
pushing people away. These

qualities are what feed into
their various self-destructive
behaviours.
More and more shows are
representing experiences
engaging in discussion that is
discouraged by ‘masculinity’.
The underrated SundanceTV
show, Rectify, discusses the
touchy subject of prison
sexual assault. The oddly
accepted and ridiculed reality
of prison-rape is put under the
lens here. The protagonist is
a victim of this, and the show
follows his attempts to come
to terms with his experiences
and life outside prison. There
are no jokes made at his
expense and the series does
not shy away from thoroughly
dissecting the impact of such
an event. A big part of the
series is also the reactions
of other characters to the
protagonist’s experiences,
and how society attempts to
belittle them.
Even Donald Glover’s
Atlanta points out the sorts of
toxic masculinity poverty and
ghettos can generate, and
their natural end-points. The
very first episode ends with
one of the main characters
shooting and killing a random
stranger, just to avoid losing
face.
On a more real-world level,
artist Grayson Perry has
made multiple documenta-
ries questioning traditional
definitions of masculinity
and sexuality. All Man, in
particular, takes the viewer
to various locales typically
associated with masculine
activities and highlights the
dysfunction or contradiction
that can reign there.
We’ve come leaps and
bounds since the paper-thin
platonic heroes of early
dramas and sitcoms, and the
ever-diversifying TV industry
seems to be gradually
engaging with, and hopefully
normalising, a diverse range
of concepts of masculinity.
\\ More shows

Unfortunately,
men dominate
the best roles in
television. So,
you’d think that
they’d at least be
represented with
nuance, right?
Well, that tends
not to be the
case.
