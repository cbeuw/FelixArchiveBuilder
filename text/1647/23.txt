Breakfast in the Sky
felix joins the creator of the Cronut®,
Dominique Ansel for breakfast mid-
air - it doesnt get much better than
Salted Honey Tarts, Cookie Shots
and Eton Mess Lunchboxes.
fresh basil, fromage blanc,
meant to be shaken into a
mess before savouring.
The Salted Honey Tart
was a closer lean towards
traditional French patisserie.
Paying homage to London’s
local honeys, the crumbly
almond frangipane surrounds
a light, sea salt milk cream,
adorned with an intricate
chocolate décor designed to
look like the roof shingles of
those rooftop honey farms.
Two types of honey filled the
spaces within the chocolate
structure, showcasing the con-
trast in fragrance and flavour.

F
or those who have
been reading my
articles, my stories
always come with
a surprise, and this
story is no exception.
A few weeks back, the
morning lecture of my dreams
came into life with a very
fortunate invite from PR– an
intimate press-exclusive
breakfast with Dominique
Ansel, the creator of the
Cronut®, on the London
Eye! I gasped and stood up
from my chair in excitement,
catching awkward stares
around the library and
worried glances from my
lab partners, thinking I had
gone mad from the endless
literature search.
In case you were wonder-
ing, Dominique Ansel is a
French-born pastry chef and
owner of the Dominique Ansel
Bakery in New York, Tokyo,
and finally, finally, finally in
London in September. He
shot to fame with his many
signature creations, including
the Cronut®, the Cookie
Shot and the Frozen S’mores,
forming 2-hour long queues
outside his Tokyo branch
every day just for a flake of
that Cronut delicious-ness.
After a sleepless night in
anticipation, I marched to the
Waterloo at 8:45 the next
morning in the freshest grey
sweater in my wardrobe, a
heart pumping with adrena-
line and, of course, an empty
stomach. I was led to a bar
beside the London Eye where
I was fed champagne (yes,
champagne), business cards
from fellow bloggers and
Dominique Ansel’s chocolate
mousse, fresh from the bakery
in Belgravia, served on silver
plastic spoons. I was sent
to the London Eye some 20
minutes later with a group of
15-or-so bloggers, all almost
skipping with happiness as we
reached the capsule.
It took a bit of pushing and
shoving to get everyone into
the moving capsule. But no
one was bothered as we were
greeted with a beautifully
decorated capsule, with the
bright September morning
sunshine and Dominique
Ansel himself, grinning to us
from the back of the capsule
with no sign of tiredness
whatsoever from the last two
rounds of breakfast.
In the center was a table
with a white- striped table
cloth, yellow flowers and
white wicker baskets pre-
senting some of Dominique
Ansel’s best creations: the
Cronut®, Welsh Rarebit crois-
sant, the DKA, the Eton Mess
Lunchbox and the Salted
Honey Tart.
Dominique waited patiently
before stealing the spotlight
from his creations back to
himself. He gave a brief intro-
duction of himself, his bakery
and the pastries on the table,
passing around a basket of
DKA’s while he spoke. The
DKA, Dominique’s Kouign
Amann (one of his signature
items), was a small Breton
pastry with a crispy, caramel-
ized crust on the outside and
a flaky, buttery crumb within.
We were halfway up look-
ing over the glorious morning
view of the whole of London
when the feast started. Hands
frantically grabbed the
pastries, clearing a quarter
of the table in 30 seconds.
I bit into the salted caramel
and cocoa nib Cronut®, the
flavour of the month. My
standards set by the several
Cookie Shot. On the small
white squared dish was a
chocolate chip cookie in the
shape of a shot glass with a
coating of dark chocolate
inside. By the side was a jug
of cold, sweet, vanilla-infused
milk, poured into the crunchy-
and-soft cookie cups, filling
to the brim. This delightful
piece of kitchen engineering
is available across all his
bakeries from 3 pm on the
dot, right in time for a child’s
after-school snack.
While I was sipping the milk
from my cookie, a pair of
bloggers next to me located
their hands on an Eton Mess
Lunchbox, Dominique’s take
on the British dessert. Inspired
by Korean lunchboxes, the
clear plastic boxes were
filled with black pepper mini
meringues, “strawberries
made of mousse and jam,
Christy Lam
Cronut dupes that have inhab-
ited London since the Cronut
craze was instantly thrown
away by the real deal. It
was exceptional. The pastry
itself, with a coat of sugar
on the outside and a ring of
icing on top, was incredibly
light, with clear layers of
thin, flaky pastry revealing a
velvety salted caramel cream
in the center. We were over-
whelmed by the explosion of
senses, aided by the level of
excitement in the capsule, and
nodded to each other with
wide, glistening eyes.
I grabbed my next target
which I’ve been drooling over
for years on Instagram – the
session ended as we were
approaching the base. Wait!
What about the leftovers?
Dominique had us covered
by distributing around bright
orange takeaway boxes,
which we all filled up with the
leftover treats to our hearts
desires. In went 2 Cronuts, a
Salted Honey Tart and a DKA
as a souvenir from my once-
in-a-lifetime breakfast lecture
for the hungry prisoners in
the Chem.Eng. library.
