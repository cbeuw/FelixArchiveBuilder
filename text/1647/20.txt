Voltron:
Legendary
Defender
Saad Ahmed
A reinvention of a cult classic
from the 80s, lovingly crafted
by the skilled hands of
Avatar’s Lauren Montgomery
& Joaquim Dos Santos. How
does Netflix’s modernisation
of the iconic Voltron franchise
hold up?
U
pon first hearing
of the Voltron
reboot, I was
sceptical. The
focus of the show
was to be on
giant flying robotic lions that
could combine together to
form an even larger robot. It
made me think that it would
be a lesser version of a
Transformers/Power Rangers
mash-up. Two things made me
decide to give it the benefit
of the doubt. One was the
fact that it was on Netflix,
which has yet to disappoint
with any of its original shows.
The other was the fact that
the creators of the beloved
Avatar shows (Legends of
Aang and Korra) were the
show runners. I’m happy to
say that my expectations
were blown straight out of
the gate and that I’m now a
Voltron fan.
The concept of Voltron is
undeniably cheesy but the
show’s so cleverly written
that it feels more like a
natural part of the plot than
a gimmick. The overarching
storyline is pretty standard; a
group of young heroes come
together through a series
of events and are chosen to
be the pilots or paladins of
the Voltron lions. Their task
is to be the protectors of the
Universe, with season 1 spe-
cifically focusing on the evil
Galra Empire.
The series is well structured
and tightly paced. Honestly,
it feels more like one big
movie than a show of several
episodes. This makes it ideal
for binge watching of course,
though it may seem as if it’s
over all too soon. The energy
and action blend smoothly
together, making you crave
the next installment. The
anime-ish art style and
combination of cel-shading
and traditional hand-drawn
TV comes neatly together to
make a work of art.
Having said that, some
parts of the show are a little
generic and tropey. You have
the standard coming together
as a team, everyone gets
separated, and then they
get betrayed by a seemingly
friendly person. Then again,
a lot of things these days
are pretty tropey (*cough*
Stranger Things *cough*) and
as long as the execution’s spot
on (which it definitely is for
Voltron!), it can be forgiven.
If tropes are something you
actively despise, this show
may not be the one for you.
Aesthetically, there are
a number of similarities
between this show and the
Avatar shows. This is not
surprising given they share
many showrunners. It’s not
just the animation style and
action sequences, even some
of the jokes are in a similar
vein. Of course, this is brilliant
news for anybody who was
a fan of either Avatar, and
desperately needs something
to fill the void. While some of
the jokes can get a little bit
cringey at times, it never feels
like too much and is always in
a fair balance.
The main characters are
also enjoyable and well writ-
ten. Initially they come across
as the usual generic heroes
you would expect. However,
with each episode, you learn
more about their back-stories,
quirks and traits; ultimately
you end up rooting for all
of them. Each pair-up and
adventure brings out different
sides of the characters and it

can be both endearing and
humorous to see the different
personalities interact with
each other.
Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for the antag-
onists who are the series’
weak point. The Galra Empire
serve as the season’s villains,
basically being the heroes’
punching bags either directly
or indirectly. They’re por-
trayed as a typical alien race,
bent on having the ultimate
weapon and conquering the
galaxy. They are never given
motivations beyond this and
are never shown any depth or
given any development; basi-
cally they’re ripped straight
from the Marvel movies. It
feels like their entire race
consists of serious, angry war
generals, making you wonder
why they haven’t eradicated
themselves from in-fighting.
In the grand scheme of
things, this is a small point,
which in no way detracts from
everything else. I’m not sure
how similar or dissimilar it
may be to the older Voltron
shows, but this version is
without a doubt an epic,
colourful, and funny take on a
classic 80’s series. In a world
where things are becoming
increasingly dark and gritty,
it’s a welcome change of
pace to see Voltron: Legend-
ary Defender embrace its
goofy and outlandish roots
while being an epic adven-
ture in its own right.
