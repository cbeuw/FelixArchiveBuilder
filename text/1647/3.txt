Union puts forward NSS recommendations
felix reads it so you don’t have to (you’re welcome)
Matt Johnston
T
he National Student
Survey (NSS) came
out earlier this year
and the long and
the short of it is that
students are getting
less and less satisfied with
both College and the Union.
The Union has now published
its list of recommendations it
wanted College to enact to try
and reverse the slump, all of
which have been accepted.
Below are the 16 recommen-
dations that the Union feel
that College and themselves
need to act on. (We’ve para-
phrased some of the boring
Union language, don’t worry)
Teaching
1. Staff should work with
students to improve teaching
2. Give credit to exceptional
lecturers and allow them the
freedom to try innovative
teaching methods
3. Students should be given
the opportunity to act as
teaching consultants.
Assessment and Feedback
4. Traffic Light system to
force feedback to be timely
(two weeks late equals red)
5. Departmental leader(s)
should be responsible for
overseeing the quality of
feedback, interacting with
Academic Reps and students.
6. Students and staff should
work closely to co-design
assessment/feedback
Academic Support
7. Continue developing the
Personal Tutor system,
\\ The most satisfied
department is
CivEng (96%) with
Physics bringing up
the rear (67%) \\
So what is the NSS?
The National Student Survey
is kind of self explanatory:
final year students complete
a survey just before they
graduate, rating the university
in several categories. 23
questions cover the eight
categories of ‘Teaching’,
‘Assessment and Feedback’,
‘Academic Support’, ‘Organ-
isation and Management’, ‘
Learning Resources’, ‘Personal
Development’, and ‘ Students’
Union’. These then show
College and the Union where
they need to up their game,
relative to either themselves
or the wider university world.
And what did the NSS
say this year?
Basically in six of the
sectors Imperial is below
the average score with only
‘Learning Resources’ and
‘Student’s Union’ buck-
ing the trend. Learning
resources also ranks us 11th
in the country and the rest
of the categories place us
anywhere from 56th
to a wor-
rying 151st
(out of 157 Higher
Education Institutions). Over-
all our satisfaction was 83%
which sounds pretty good
until you realise this puts
us 114th, with the national
average being 86%. It’s also
a 5% drop from ourselves a
year ago. The most satisfied
department is CivEng (96%)
with Physics bringing up
the rear (67%). Physics also
dropped the most from last
year, a decrease of 20% in
satisfaction, quite the drop.
So what are the plans
to solve this?
10. Provide termly timeta-
bles in advance of term start
dates (i.e. stick to the actual
College policy)
Learning Resources
11. Look at how best to use
space within college, espe-
cially at busy times
12. Make sure facilities are
still world-class and push
utilising digital technology for
learning too
possibly via a Personal Tutor
network. Consider splitting
the academic and pastoral
care aspects of the role.
8. Standardise the admin-
istration around mitigating
circumstances
Organisation and
Management
9. Compile all deadlines that
a student may have, in order
to spread them out evenly

Personal Development
13. Ensure all departments
agree a minimum amount
of free time for students.
Decided by Faculty working
closely with students.
14. Make sure the skills
employers want are in
modules
The Union
15. Look at how to tell the
students what the Union is
actually doing.
16. Find how to engage stu-
dents and allow them to make
the changes they want.
What does it all mean?
This all depends on whether
the recommendations are
actually adhered to once
enacted and are actually
worthwhile. What the declin-
ing student satisfaction does
mean is that it effects our
overall ranking as a univer-
sity. This has the potential to
effect our place within the
Teaching Excellence Frame-
work (TEF), the government
policy which means your
tuition fees rise by £250 next
year. So that might change
should Imperial keep falling.
