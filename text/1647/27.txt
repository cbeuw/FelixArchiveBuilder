urprise surprise,
the liberal left are
complaining again!
It seems as though
anti-establishment
figures are only
allowed if they follow their ideals
– well guess again you guardian-
reading-champagne-socialist
whiners! I for one welcome our
new overlord – for too long have
the rich and famous of the USA
been placed under the tyranny of
taxes, because they should pull
their own weight? Maybe those
disadvantaged masses who never
had access to that privilege should
stop scrounging off the state and
get a job. Yeah, I said it.
It’s also high time that the left
stopped ignoring the pestilence
that is immigration. We’ve all
heard the crock about how
America is the melting pot of
cultures, but guess what buddy?
TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL THE
BROTH. Look, I have plenty of
Mexican friends as well, and even
they say that there are too many
of them – literally ask my gardener
José he’s always saying “Odio
los blancos” (I think blanco is an
ethnic name but I don’t speak
beaner). Furthermore, is it really
too much to ask just to be able
to control our borders? All we
want is a barrier that protects our
money, wealth, lack of corruption
in our politicians (Hillary I see you
#Jail2017), or absence of gang
warfare from these Hispanics.
Just to clarify, I’m not racist, but
do we really need more piñatas?
We invented Taco Bell to steal
their secrets, so do we need them
anymore? Answer? NO! DEPORT
THEM NOW!
He also told us he would make
China pay for their currency
manipulation, and although I don’t
know what that means, I’ve never
trusted those lot. What’s wrong
with an alphabet that we can
actually read, huh guys? Trying to
exclude us from your little club?
Well bye-bye trade with the USA!
Also, all they make is iPhones,
and I already have one anyway
so they can stop selling them to us
anyway. Apple is as American as,
well, apple pie, and they would
love to create more factories and
jobs in a country with an actual
minimum wage. They only moved
to China because Obama wanted
to tax them unfairly – now there’s
a republican in the White House,
they will return and pay their dues
I’m sure of it.
All in all, I wish The Left would
stop treating politics like a fucking
game, and respect our desire to
Make America Great Again. Stop
whining and bow down to your
new master. I mean President. Not
racist.
O
kay, give me a
second. I just
need to mop
down all the
tears off of my
keyboard. Okay.
It’s not that bad – I mean George
Bush had two consecutive terms
and even if he did do 9/11, we all
got through it and had Obama
and okay I don’t believe any of
what I’m writing. This is literally
the end of the world. EVERYONE
IS RACIST AND STUPID HOW
CAN ALL THESE INBRED
MORONS VOTE FOR AN ANTI-
ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATE
THAT IS AS STUPID AS THE
PEOPLE THEMSELVES.
This wouldn’t have happened
if we had nominated Bernie. He
would have changed everything:
tuition loans would be free as
soon as he came into office; all
racism would have disappeared;
he would have put a tax on Wall
Street and all corruption in bank-
ing would have disappeared; and
world peace would have been
declared and everyone would
hold hands in a coalition of love
and harmony. Bernie was just
better – even though he didn’t
have anywhere near the amount of
Capitol Hill experience, or senior
leadership experience, he was
funny and charismatic.
As soon as I found out, I
messaged all 40 of my Tumblr
followers and we launched a
protest outside the American
Embassy immediately after I’d put
my tofu in the fridge to marinate
overnight. How dare they allow
a person we don’t like become
democratically elected? We spent
hours chanting “Not my President”
and “Fuck Trump”, and for some
reason the people in the embassy
didn’t come out and congratulate
us for being the noble saviours of
the political system. Although I felt
valiant in protesting something that
happened in politics that I don’t
like, the actual idea of working in
politics and trying to enact change
sounds a lot harder than posting
think pieces in my blogs every few
weeks.
The biggest shock for me was
that my entire social media feed
seemed to be totally against
Trump, and all the websites that I
read and frequently comment on
were saying he was really bad,
and yet there was a mysterious
electorate that appeared from
nowhere who wanted change.
Um hello, did you not see the
past eight years? We had a black
president who solved every
problem! He sorted out the finance
sector so nobody cheated, and
now everyone in America has free
healthcare – I mean I guess drone
bombing was kind of bad but he
said it was necessary and I mean
Snowden did break the law even if
he discovered that we were being
spied upon.
Anyway, I am retreating to my
bomb shelter in which I await
the apocalypse and hope that
death will come before I starve. I
think Quorn has a long shelf life
anyway.
My tumblr didn’t see
this coming
Jonathan Masters mourns the
impending doom that a Trump
presidency heralds
The people have
spoken so STFU

left, demanding it shuts up, sucks
