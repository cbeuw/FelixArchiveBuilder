Life Itself
Y
ou know
something is amiss
when innocent
men have to
abandon their
homes and live as
fugitives in a country where
they are not welcome, in
order to survive. However,
this is the situation gay
Palestinian men face today.
Ostracized by their own
country, shunned by their own
people, and threatened by
their own families they are
forced to flee for their lives.
The destination? Tel-Aviv.
Where – being Palestinians
– if they are discovered they
are returned to Palestine, and
an awaiting death. To avoid
being killed they try to find a
means to escape again. This
is the cycle, the torment, in
which many gay Palestinian
men live in today. Escape,
hide, capture, return, repeat
until death.
Director Yariv Mozer’s Invis-
ible Men, offers a raw insight
into the lives of some of these
men, who have committed
no crime except to love those
who their society has deemed
unfit. It unapologetically
shows the struggles these
men face, the torture – literal
as well as emotional – they
have been through and the
torture they face. Their lives
are at such risk that the only
way they are guaranteed to
survive is through applying
for asylum outside of Israel.
The administration involved,
compounded with their unsub-
stantiated belief that they
will not succeed, as well as
plain reluctance to leave their
homeland serve as major
deterrents for many men. The
film follows three men who
decided to apply and tells
their story as they progress
through the application
process.
Mozer has been promoting
the message of Invisible Men
for the past four years and
continued to do so during
his Q&A at Imperial. Having
directed several films, both
features and documentaries,
exploring the topic of sexual
identity, and identifying as
gay himself, he was clearly
effort Yariv put into this film
was all for the sake of raising
awareness.
The change that is needed is
political. However, the move
that will catalyse it is how
masculinity (and femininity) is
viewed worldwide. The mind-
sets of numerous families,
communities, and countries
need to be changed about
these issues. The view that
the LGBT community partake
in something ‘dishonorable’
needs to be scrapped. And
films like this are necessary
in raising awareness to our
generation, the ones who
can further change about
such problems around
the world. When asked
whether he thought the film
had resulted in ‘change’ he
replied, “I’m realistic when
it comes to making change
with the power of cinema.
Politicians can make change.
Social movements can make
change. Sometimes raising
the awareness of one person,
making him change the way
he looks at reality, at life,
will show when he meets
someone in need, these are
the small things that will make
a big change. Sometimes
one person [at this Q&A] can
become a minister or a prime
minister in the future, right?
And they will change things.
And that is stronger than a
reality program.”
Thank you to the Imperial
College Israeli Society for
hosting the event and to Yariv
Mozer for an illuminating
session.

very passionate about its mes-
sage. He, however, has the
luxury of being an Israeli cit-
izen. Under the protection of
his Israeli passport he filmed
the Palestinian men (who
have since been granted
asylum and are safe in
Europe) for over 2 years, all
the while unsure of whether
he would have a finished
product in the end – he had
promised to never show their
faces were they unfortunate
enough to not be granted
asylum. The complications
of shooting the film were
numerous: Yariv described
how he always had to stay
a good distance behind the
men whilst shooting in public,
for their safety. However,
being filmed by a Israeli crew
also gave the men a shield;
they felt like they belonged
in the Israeli community, and
hence felt safe. This juxta-
position of what is and isn’t
safe highlights the confusing
and unstable life the men
live, always vulnerable and
never at ease. The financial,

Yariv Mozer - The Invisible Men
A
year after
publishing his
2011 memoir
Life Itself,
Roger Ebert
contacted
Steve James, the
accomplished director of
Stevie and Hoop Dreams,
to make an accompanying
documentary of the same
name. It must have been
a daunting proposition.
Assembling the definitive
life story of the world’s most
famous film critic is certainly
not an easy task. It makes
me therefore happy to
report, that James ultimately
succeeded in producing a
biography with subtlety,
sincerity and an undeniable
intelligence.
Overall, it was an interesting
experience watching this film
as I was only vaguely aware
of Roger Ebert’s work. I knew
who he was but, I suppose
not living in America or being
alive whilst his show was on
television, I was never really
aware of the cultural jugger-
naut he was. I certainly had
no idea about the intricacies
of his character and personal
life which James explores
and presents so well here.
Producing comprehensive
biographical documentaries
can often be hard. After
all, any person one wishes
to study is a complex being
with opinions, characteristics,
biases, likes and dislikes all
working together. Where Life
Itself succeeded was in leav-
ing me with the feeling that
I really got to know Ebert. I
also liked how the filmmakers
were not afraid to include
some of the less glamorous
aspects of Ebert’s life, from
his alcoholism to his ego. But,
whereas other directors often
present topics like these in a
manipulatively melancholic
way, James understood that
these were human flaws
and presented them with the
nuance and complexity that
should be expected when
telling a deeply personal life
story. The way Asif Kapadia
handled Amy Winehouse’s
life story in Amy is another
example of this done well.
There were a few things
I think the film was missing
however. His love for film was
made clear but I never got a
sense of his opinions or which
films he liked or disliked, and
for what reason. Which films
affected him the most? What
philosophies does he spell
out in the way that he writes
about them? On top of this,
I also really wanted to know
what made Ebert better than
the average reviewer on
Rotten Tomatoes. There were
also a few parts of the film
which felt slightly pointless, at
least to the wider narrative.
The section on the Cannes
film festival is an example
of a part of the film which
didn’t really go anywhere or
provide interesting insight.
I would understand if other
people disagree with me on
this though. Overall, I com-
mend the filmmakers for being
restrained in their runtime and
not letting everything drag
on for too long. It’s definitely
a pitfall for a lot of similar
biographical films, Scorsese’s
Marley is one example. All
this adds up to a biographi-
cal film which works in every
way it should. I should think
Ebert would be very happy to
add this documentary to his
legacy.
