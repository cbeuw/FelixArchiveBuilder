felix investigates the rise of sous-vide
technology, and how it can turn the
most manly of dishes into something
more refined.

teak: at its
finest, a juicy,
browned hunk
of meat, bursting
with flavour,
and apparently
quintissentialy manly. At its
worst, a drab, uninspired
piece of “grilling” that
disappoints in every mouthful.
At their most basic, steaks
harken back to the most
simple of cooked foods that
our proto-chef ancestors
would have cooked - meat on
hot coals. Cooking a steak
like this, directly on a bed of
embers, is an experience to
try if you haven’t already - the
end result is something that
really makes me feel alive.
on the outside, there is never
the same degree of perfection
in the inside. I’ve done pan
fried, reverse seared, roasted
and almost every varia-
tion. Don’t get me wrong,
they were all tasty - but the
beautifully tender middle was
spoiled by the band of grey,
overcooked meat around
the edge - a simple flaw with
The only problem is, crunch-
ing your way thorugh bits
of burned on charcoal isn’t
exactly tasty. That, plus the
wide disparity in the degree
of doneness in the steak
ruined what should have
been a beautiful dish.
I have cooked steaks in
many ways, and the under-
lying problem with so many
is that whilst they may look
beautiful, browned and crisp
direct heat cooking and the
fact that no steak is perfectly
uniform - some areas will
cook faster than others.
The only method yet to sat-
isfy my desire for pink, tender
meat from edge to edge is
sous-vide – waterbathing
a vacuum sealed piece of
meat for anywhere from 1-72
hours, with amazing results.
I was fortunate enough to be
given an immersion circulator
(read: heating element, pump
and temperature feedback)
for my 21st, and good god
of food, it transforms steaks.
It give you something that
in the restaurant world we
desire exceptionally highly –
consistency – as by cooking
at 54.5C, you guarantee
a perfect medium rare. No
more “2 minutes on each
side” or anything so non-sci-
entific: sous vide gives you
unparalled control. A water-
bath followed by a quick
blowtorch is all that’s needed.
Such a simple, glorious food
as steak can be turned into
the most precisely cooked
creation, without much hassle
at all.
Chances are, you’ll all have
something sous-vide in the
next few weeks - more and
more restaurants and eateries
are turning to it to deliver the
best result. And yet, some
days I will still turn to my
trusty old skillet, or light up
the charcoal.

Caught something you wish you
hadn’t? Aside from some Acyclovir,
this is the next best thing. felix takes a
look at the classic flu-buster: Chicken
soup
D
o you remember
when you were
five and after a
few cold autumn
days, you got
so sick that you
couldn’t get out of bed? But,
miraculously, your mum knew
exactly what to do so you
would feel better. More often
than not, it was *suspense*

chicken soup, and in just an
instant, you felt better! Now I
don’t say that it was the soup
or you really wanting to go out
again, but you get my point.
I know that soup is not the
most common meal in college -
I actually haven’t seen anyone
eating soup here, but I must
say that this is the food that
reminds me of home, family
and childhood. So, just in case
you want to be hit by some nos-
talgia, I’ll show you my Soupe
Recette.
minutes. Add water until half of
your pot is full. Let it boil, while
you handle the veggies.
I prefer big pieces of
carrots, so I just cut them into
4-5 chunks. But if you prefer
small pieces, just chop them
smaller. Peel and cut the onion
in quarters. Add the beans,
carrots and onion to the pot.
Top up the pan with water if
necessary.
Now, time for the funny part!
Beat the eggs in a bowl. When
they are quite mixed, start
adding some semolina. Keep
mixing and adding semolina
until you get a pretty thick
paste - it shouldn’t fall off the
spoon quickly when turned
upside down.
Check for the pot from time
to time and make sure that
everything is covered in water.
If not, just add more. Cook
everything until the carrots
can be cut using just a spoon -
nice and tender. Now, using a
spoon (it strikes again), add the
semolina mixture into the hot
water, one spoonful at a time.
You will get floating spheres of
semolina, which makes your
dumplings.
After all the semolina is
added, check again that there
is enough water. Wait 5-7
more minutes and …. you’re
done! Good job - you’ve fin-
ished, probably, your first soup
and it doesn’t even look like
the soup you are used to! Add
salt and pepper (maybe some
chilli) and the chopped parsley
leaves and enjoy.
