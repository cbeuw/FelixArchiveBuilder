A
march for
education is
taking place
on Saturday
the 19th
of
November in
London, where students and
academics will be protesting
budget cuts, tuition fee rises
and increases of student debt.
Maximum tuition fees are set
for a 2.8% increase, which will
see Imperial charge £9,250
for the academic year of
2017-2018. At the same time,
maintenance grants and NHS
bursaries are being scrapped,
and the student loan terms are
being changed.
The march was announced
earlier this year in July, but
has steadily been gaining
momentum. On Monday
the 14th
of November,
the government released
amendments to the Higher
Education and Research Bill
Education demo still happening
...despite the Higher Education and Research Bill ammendments
Lef Apostolakis
of university governance
and downgrading research
councils.
In a piece for the Guardian,
published last October,
Professor Stephen Curry,
Director of Undergraduate
Studies in the Department
of Life Sciences, addressed
the need for amendments to
the Bill, and warned against
the Teaching Excellence
Framework (TEF), particularly
the creation of a super-
research council. “Never
before in the history of British
science have so few individuals
been responsible for so much
spending,” wrote Curry.
Further on the downgrade
of research councils and the
creation of a new powerful
overarching council, UK
Research and Innovation
(UKRI), Curry wrote: “from
before the middle of the last
century, science’s influence
in government has had multi-
polar characteristics. Heads of
autonomous funding councils,
Whitehall chief scientists,
learned societies, academics,
and even campaign groups
have together worked with,
and sometimes against,
government to protect the
research base. This can never
be the task of one or two
individuals, yet the proposed
arrangements invest a great
deal of power in the chair and
chief executive of UKRI.”
We talked to Curry about
the amendments released
earlier this week: “I was
pleased to see the amendment
on Monday that sought to
clarify that the Secretary of
State (via the OfS) could NOT
give any guidance on what
courses universities could or
could not teach,” said Curry.
“However the OfS still has
the power to repeal university
Royal Charters and that still
seems to me to be a threat
to the independence and
autonomy of our universities. I
also remain concerned about
the loss of voice and standing
of the research councils in the
establishment of UKRI. I’m not
against UKRI per se – it could
well do some good things but
I think further amendments or
clarifications are needed to
ensure that the voice of the
research community is heard
loud and clear in government”
However, Sorana Vieru,
NUS Vice President (Higher
Education) warns, “now is not
the time to be complacent…
[students] will be taking to
the streets on November 19
to demand our voices are
heard.”
“While I’m pleased to see
the changes we’ve been
calling for put in place, the
being made about them.
These amendments show how
students can have an impact
and influence change if we
work together”, she continues.
The education demo is
organised by the National
Students Union (NUS) and
the University College Union
(UCU). In preparation, at a
rally hosted by SOAS Union
on Wednesday, attended by
NUS President Malia Bouattia
and Leader of the Labour
party, Jeremy Corbyn.
When asked about the
stance of ICU on the education
demo, Union President Nas
Andriopoulos said “Imperial
College Union, which is not
affiliated to the National
Union of Students, does not
have a formal stance on the
demonstration or the Higher
Education and Research Bill.
As of yet, none of our students
have approached the Union to
join the demonstration. We do,
however, hold concerns about
the bill which will allow for-
profit organisations to enter
the Higher Education sector
more easily. Furthermore,
we do not think that the
metrics that will be used
to access teaching quality
in the Teaching Excellence
Framework are necessarily a
good measure for excellence.“
he continued.
Amendments also included
appointing a student
representative to the Office
for Students Board, more
support for postgraduate
research training and stronger
protection of students. “It
seems to me a good idea to
have student representation
in the OfS,” said Curry,
“however, I remain worried
about aspects of the TEF
– it still risks becoming
burdensome and too heavily
driven by metrics which (as we
all know) do a very poor job
of capturing or characterising
educational quality, which is
the thing that students, staff
and government all ought to
be working together on.”
The amendments were made
public as Jo Johnson, Minister
of State for Universities and
Sciencetooktotwittertoinform
students and lecturers of the
government’s willingness to
listen, saying “Thanks for the
scrutiny - listened to students,
unis and academics,and today
tabling range of amendments
to the HE & Research Bill”.
original omission of a student
from an office named after
us showed the government’s
plans for what they really are
– driving market competition
and not ensuring student
needs are met. We still have a
lot of work to do to challenge
the government’s overhaul
of higher education and put
better plans forward. I’m glad
the government has finally
agreed with us that students
should be included in decisions

first came under fire for various
reasons such as the creation of
