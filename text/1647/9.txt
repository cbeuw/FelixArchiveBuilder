Deteriorating eyesight in bonobos shows that we’re not the only ones that may need to wear
glasses as we get older
A
ge related
far-sightedness
in humans
can easily be
demonstrated
by simply
observing one of your
older relatives as they tip
their glasses and extend
their arm out to read
the morning paper. This
phenomenon, known as
presbyopia, is brought
about by the hardening of
the lens and weakening of
the muscles around it over
time. Many explanations
for this deterioration
are founded by popular
opinion, with most blaming
the evils of technology
in one way or another.
However, new research
indicating that humans are
not alone in this problem
can, perhaps, debunk these
ideas. Researchers at Kyoto
University noticed how a
senior male bonobo called
‘Ten’ was staying a noticeable
distance away from a
fellow troop member as he
groomed them, appearing to
require this distance to see
lice in their fur. This simple
observation prompted a
larger study involving the
analysis of a decade’s worth
of behavioural footage of the
grooming patterns of bonobo
chimps in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. The results
Ryu explains, the relative
cohesiveness and gregarious-
ness of bonobo assemblages
means that, for the most part,
“old bonobos can just follow
the younger individuals”.
This research also has
several implications for
humans, with the authors
suggesting that we could
now investigate how other
tissues senesce in bonobos in
comparison to humans and
whether this could explain
why humans live so much
longer. Ultimately, it seems
that progressively worsen-
ing eye-sight is down to an
unavoidable throwback to the
common ancestors we share
with these great apes. In any
respect, at least it’s not solely
due to staring at computer
screens all day, regardless of
what our grandmothers may
say.
of this study showed that,
whereas younger bonobos
(<30 years) tended to focus
at around 10cm, individuals
who were 40+ had to move
over 20cm away to groom
properly.
Unfortunately, this deteriora-
tion in the bonobos’ eyesight
likely implicates serious
consequences in their social
standing and even survival.
Older bonobo males are
often among the least pop-
ular grooming partners and
this is seemingly the result of
their eyesight-induced inabil-
ity to hold up their half of the
mutualistic practice of groom-
ing. Moreover, in the dark
Congolese rainforests, far
sightedness could also lead to
problems with navigation and
the spotting of human hunters.
However, as head researcher
of this project Dr. Heunglin
Do old bonobos need to go to specsavers?
W
hy do
we find
some
people
more
attractive than others?
Qualities such as a sense of
humour, good looks, and
honesty are often considered
attractive. However, you
may be surprised to discover
that your immune system
influences your choice of
partner.
The immune system is the
series of molecular mecha-
nisms that defend against
invading parasites. But what
does this have to do with
attractiveness? Attractive
individuals are said to possess
‘good genes’ that affect the
immune system in a way that
promotes health. These genes
are detectable and can be
passed on to offspring.
So, what do good genes
look like? The ‘handicap prin-
ciple’ suggests that signals
which put the signaller at a
disadvantage are reliable.
Testosterone is an important
male sex hormone which
promotes the growth of
ornaments in animals but also
reduces immune cell activity.
fewer bouts of ill health and
also father more offspring.
Symmetry is also a good
indicator of genetic quality,
representing an ability to
buffer against environmental
disturbance. Men and women
consistently rate increasingly
symmetrical faces as more
attractive.
Beauty may even be in
the health of the beholder.
Women who have suffered
from childhood illness have a
stronger preference for more
masculine male faces. This
preference is even stronger
in individuals with poorer
current health.
The ‘complementary genes
hypothesis’ suggests that indi-
viduals will be most attracted
to mates with maximally
different immune systems.
The major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) is part of
the immune system – MHC
molecules bind to infectious
pathogens, initiating an
immune response. Partners
with dissimilar MHCs will pro-
duce offspring with a diverse
array of MHC molecules, pro-
viding defence against many
different pathogens. Females
are able to recognize the
degree of dissimilarity of a
potential partner’s MHC using
odour. Women scent-rated
men’s t-shirts as being more
attractive if the wearer had
a dissimilar MHC. Opposites
really do attract.
Therefore, costly ornaments,
such as a peacock’s tail, can
only be maintained by healthy
individuals. The ‘immunocom-
petence handicap hypothesis’
suggests that animals show-
case their good genes through
ornaments that represent their
ability to cope with parasites.
In humans, potential good
gene indicators are facial
masculinity and symmetry.
Testosterone promotes a typi-
cally masculine appearance,
including a wide face with
a strong jaw and prominent
brow ridges. There is mixed
evidence as to whether women
really prefer masculine faces.
But are ‘masculine men’
healthier? Studies have shown
that masculine men report

F
act: ‘Brain freeze’
has a biological
explanation.
It even has an
unpronounceable
name: sphenopala-
tine ganglioneuralgia. When
something very cold touches
the roof of your mouth (called
the ‘palate’), it rapidly cools
the blood in the small blood
vessels around your sinuses.
This causes them to constrict,
and then to rapidly dilate
again when the blood warms
up again (which happens
when you stop necking ice
cream to take a breath).
Pain receptors in your mouth
detect this relaxation of the
blood vessels, but due to
something called ‘referred
pain’, it feels like the pain
comes from your forehead,
even though the signals
originated in the roof of your
mouth. This is because the
same nerve carries signals for
facial pain and palate pain,
and because you’re just more
used to being slapped in the
face than in the roof of your
mouth you assign this pain to
your forehead as a force of
habit.
Researching brain freeze
might seem pointless, but
scientists actually use it as a
model for other headaches
that are not understood as
well, such as migraines, so
somewhere out there there’s
probably a scientist that will
pay you to eat ice cream
as fast as possible. Time to
sack off those consultancy
applications.

// The millions we
spend nowadays on
aspirin, ibruprofen,
and paracetomol
is money spent to
undo the effects of
too much omega-6
and too little ome-
ga-3 in the diet //
Nowadays, an oversup-
ply of macronutrients (fat,
carbohydrates and protein)
contributes to the increase
in obesity and diabetes.
However, many overlook the
significance of the severe
lack of micronutrients. This
is just as bad. The problem
is that we’re eating more
seeds than leaves, and it’s
the leaves which compress
all the healthy treasures our
bodies thrive on: antioxidants,
phytochemicals, and omega-
3. Most people associate
omega-3 with fish only, but
fish feed on algae which is
where the most common fat
in nature, alpha-linolenic
acid (ALA), originates. So
how does omega-3 link to
diabetes? Since omega-3
makes cell membranes more
permeable, cells are also
more sensitive to insulin,
that chemical that regulates
fat storage. This means an
omega-3 rich diet could help
to protect against obesity.
I’m not saying seeds are all
that bad. In fact, they boast a
whole host of health benefits.
For example, sunflower seeds
are rich in B vitamins that
nourish your nervous system
and bones. However, these
guys are rich in omega-6 fatty
acids, which are involved in
fat storage rather than neuro-
logical development, glucose
metabolism, and inflammation
calming. Since the two types
of fatty acids compete with
each other for enzymes and
space in our cell membranes,
the actual ratio of omega-6
and omega-3 matters more
than we think. Replacing
the recommended omega-3
amounts with omega-6 can
be hazardous to health. The
most surprising statistic in
Pollan’s book was that the
ratio of omega-6 to omega-3
in most Americans now is
10:1 rather than 3:1 before
the introduction of seed oils in
the 80’s. Hence a key note at
this point: don’t start downing
omega-3 pills unless you
also reduce your intake of
omega-6!
Omega-3 is highly unstable
in nature, but sadly, the food
industry is more focused
on storing food (never buy
anything with a shelf-life of
forever, except for perhaps
honey) rather than promot-
ing good health. So many
meat, dairy and other typical
market buys are stuffed with
omega-6 instead of the mar-
ginally better stuff, or worse
still, have omega-3 replaced
with partially hydrogenated
oils. Most supermarkets
promote ‘low-fat’ or ‘non-fat’,
warping our minds into think-
ing that fat in general is the
greatest demon of all. Joseph
Hibbeln, a researcher at the
National Institute of Health
said that the millions we
spend nowadays on aspirin,
ibuprofen, and paracetamol
is money spent to undo the
effects of too much omega-6
and too little omega-3 in the
diet. The scary bit doesn’t
end there. Similar popula-
tion studies concluded that
falling rates of omega-3
were correlated to ADHD in
children and rising rates of
suicide and depression. How
crazy is all this? The obvious
solution here would be to eat
more omega-3 rich foods, but
in light of this fantastic book,
I implore a more dedicated,
almost meditative approach.
This is not a lazy demand to
‘eat well and be healthy’, this
is a necessary mental shift in
this day and age of growing
nutrition science and bad
media.

hereby appeal to
everyone: pick up a
copy of Michael Pollan’s
In Defence of Food this
week. It truly drives
home how food is being
treated in this nutrition-
crazed world, with people’s
sad attempts to reduce it to
health components. Most
forget that food in itself is
more significant than this.
One key fact that stood out
to me was Pollan’s stance on
omega 3, the polyunsaturated
fatty acid which we know
is good for overall health,
especially the brain. There
are other fats which our body
can synthesise from other
nutritional components, but
omega 3 isn’t one of them,
making them more important
than we think.
