Several scoring opportunities
came and went, but IC’s
defence meant the opposition
wouldn’t be scoring soon.
Strong attacking play from
IC’s forwards had the team
breathing down the UCL
team’s necks. Last play of the
game. Continuing to connect
phase after phase, the
opportunity eventually came
and full back Alex Hawkings
crossed the whitewash to put
IC even. Windy conditions
tipped the ball off the tee
twice so Charles Price-Smith,
replacing regular kicker
Henry ‘Topknot’ Allingham,
lined up the drop kick, drifting
just wide of the posts. A
valiant draw to finish and a
perfect set up to a team pub
golf trip, leaving the majority
of the team handicapped (pun
fully intended).
T
he 9th
of November
saw the rugby 1st
XV arrive at their
ever windy fortress
Harlington to face
UCL. After a brief
hiatus during the warm-up,
the team were out for a few
minutes before heading back
into the changing room to
slide on their ‘mysteriously
moist’ playing shirts.
At kick off, IC came out
figuratively (and literally)
steaming as they applied
pressure on the opposition.
Touchline support saw the
four biggest tackles of the
season so far in the space of
two minutes. Each individual
battle put UCL behind the
gain line. Although IC
struggled for possession, it
was clear UCL had little to
offer from their backline as
their forwards continued to
pick and go from multiple
rucks. Despite this, a ragged
ball out to their backs and
a dropped tackle saw
them head under the posts
for their first points. Not
disheartened, IC were soon
back in UCL’s red zone, with
Josh O’Donnell finishing off a
fantastic display of physicality
from the squad’s favourite
ginger, Sam Moorby.
IC’s lineout was struggling
to find a rhythm, with plenty
of lost possession. This
wasn’t helped by fly half
James Field, who decided
to question whether the ref
knew what sport we were
playing. He confirmed
we were indeed playing
gentlemen’s rugby, by raising
his right arm to place Field in
the sin-bin. This put the team
under pressure and placed
the opposition on IC’s try line.
A lapse of concentration from
bewildered Alex Clayton
allowed UCL to jump over the
line for an easy try.
IC came out firing after the
restart. Eventual Man-of-the-
Match Clayton exploited
isolated attackers to steal
their possession twice at

L
ast weekend, fresher
Harry Peck competed
at the Irish Open, an
international men’s
épée tournament in
Dublin. Although he
has fenced regularly at an
international level for both the
cadet under-17s and junior
under-20s, it was Harry’s
first senior international
event. Starting the day with
no ranking Harry ended
up in poule one, where he
achieved five victories out of
a possible six, losing only to
Giannotte from Luxembourg
whilst defeating fencers from
Ireland, Australia, Slovakia
and Germany.
The first round acted as
seeding for the second round,
where Harry found himself
in poule six. He won three
of five matches, beating
competitors from Slovenia,
the USA and Poland along
the way. The losses came
courtesy of a fencer from
Singapore and his Brixton
clubmate, also in the pool
with him, from Bulgaria. After
these two rounds Harry found
himself in 29th
place going
into the direct eliminations out
of 64 fencers.
In the first round of
knockout matches, Harry
faced off against French
fencer Martelly, seeded
36th
. Refereed by Imperial’s
own Jamie Simpson, Harry
overcame his start to finish
incredibly strongly win-
ning the match 15-12. This
gave Harry a really tough
match in the last 32 of the
competition against the 3rd
ranked fencer Zorzato from
Poland. The result of the
match was even clearer than
the first, a comfortable win
for Harry 15-9, setting him
up against his Great Britain
and Brixton teammate, Aml
Sinclair. Again Harry breezed
past his opponent earning
himself a place in the quarter
final of the competition
against the Portuguese fencer
Arede.
This match proved to be the
tightest so far, coming down
to a sudden death point. But
Harry again proved his abil-
ity to be triumphant, winning
13-12. The semi-final against
the Romanian Dragomir was
a return to form for Harry,
winning 15-10 and setting
up a nail-biting final against
another of Dragomir’s fellow
countrymen. The final was
back and forth, neither fencer
taking a substantial lead.
The Romanian led Harry for
long periods of time, however
our Brit pulled ahead at a
decisive time in the match to
win 15-13 and take the title
of Irish Open Champion! This
moves Harry just outside the
world top 200. Not bad for
someone who has just got into
the top ten of Great Britain.
Congratulations Mr Peck!

Despite the struggling lineout,

the screw and UCL’s pack
couldn’t handle the pressure.

he 37th
Internationales
Wasserballturnier
Aachener SV 06
is arguably the
most important
event in IC Water Polo’s 2016
calendar. After meeting early
in the morning on the 4th
of
November, the team travelled
in convoy through France,
Belgium (unintentionally),
the Netherlands, and finally
Germany. After arriving at
a university campus where
the only signs of life were
an unsuspecting man in a
kitchen and a karate class,
the team were nonetheless
confused. None more so than
TJ Leo Pashov, who insisted
we were still in Belgium.
The men had drawn strong
opponents in the group
stages, namely Essen and
the home favourites Aachen.
The women also had Aachen,
with DJK SV Poseidon
members of the squad having
not played competitively
before, it was not all doom
and gloom. There were some
positives. David Moores and
Tobias Dawson completed
the club’s first successful ‘Pro-
tokol’ in two years, making an
impression on the locals with
their interpretation and button
pressing skills. More positive,
hopefully lasting, impressions
included personal achieve-
ments for Andrew Duckworth
and Ronan Tanguy, who
were complimented on their
water polo assets (cheeky)
by an interested local. An
after party followed; a great
chance for International Rela-
tions officer Sam to find out
that local teens thought quite
highly of British students.
With the words of the great
Mickie Krause still ringing in
their ears, the guys lined up
on the Sunday morning full
of optimism. Despite Sam’s
best efforts to deflect tame
opposition shots into his own
net, one Imperial goal (scored
by Ramon, dedicated to
Jenny Lea) led to another and
before we knew it, Imperial
won by a favourable margin.
Next game also saw success,
everything capped off with
a debut international goal
from Jon Arizti. Finishing
with a 50-50 win ratio, the
highest ever from an Imperial
Duisburg for company but
with their squad totalling
only three players, they were
going to have a tough time
playing a seven-a-side sport.
Once the Germans finally
showed up, a team bonding
session alleviated concerns.
Having borrowed players,
team in the tournament, the
guys could go home happy.
The girls unfortunately come
away without a win, despite
Laura’s best dabbing efforts.
Overall, a successful trip.
Huge thanks to Social Sec
Massive Tobias Dawson for
organising everything. Can’t
wait for next year. Or fines
night.
\\ Imperial won

the women made a nervous
start, with club President Tina

The guys were also having
problems, with a ‘moving

shooting form. No success
on day one, but with some
