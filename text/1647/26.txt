Is it good?
Is it bad?
Will it get
you laid,
or do you
just think it will? In short: who
knows? But we did some
research (and asked a lot of
people) to try and at least
vaguely answer some of these
questions.
It was really interesting
talking to straight men about
masculinity and whether they
think it impacts their desirabil-
ity. Obviously our sample isn’t
necessarily representative
of the global population, or
even the British population,
but hey, we tried.
Characteristics typically
associated with masculinity
such as a good physique, ath-
leticism, financial security and
confidence were acknowl-
edged for playing a part in
male desirability but other
more traditionally feminine
traits, such as kindness and
sensitivity were also consid-
ered important factors. Guys
felt that there is some pressure
to be masculine, strong and to
pick up the bill, but they also
felt that women don’t really
care much for demonstrations
of bravado.
Does that illustrate a shift
away from masculinity
norms? Maybe. At the end of

the month in Southbank, there
will be a whole weekend
dedicated to addressing
the challenges and issues
surrounding the masculine
identity. Tackling about
stopping violence towards
women, addressing the
silence surrounding male
mental health and generally
the social constraints that
it’s the unbearded male with
the strong jawline that has the
advantage, as beards signify
age, maturity and social
status, attributes sought after
in long term partners.
“Ugh this is so heteronor-
mative.” I was literally about
to– Anyway, scientifically,
it’s strongly suggested that
gay men prefer masculine
fetishises it. Masculinity
becomes the main object of
desire, the ideal to aspire to,
the end goal. Being masculine
becomes an even greater
commodity: If I had a pound
for every time someone
begged me to let my mon-
obrow grow, I’d probably
indulge in weekly eyebrow
threading.
Masculinity is constantly
sought after and applauded.
Gay culture is full of such
examples. Just take a look
at the porn industry (or just
take our word for it). It is
overflowing with hypermas-
culinity, and a quick look at
the ‘dating scene’ will verify
that this is not an isolated
phenomenon. Hook-up apps
are full of unabashed masc-
4masc profiles: users looking
for masculine men, real men,
MEN.
As a gay man, you will
receive positive reinforcement
for every ‘choice’ you make
that enhances your mascu-
linity. Do you have a beard?
Do you have body hair? Are
you tall and muscular? Are
you an authority figure? Do
you do SPORTS? Is your voice
nice and bassy? Do you have
a big dick? Prepare to be
adored. You will be felt up in
clubs, invited to threesomes
and called daddy (probably).
On the other hand, your
stock will lose value for
every choice you make that
embraces your feminine side.
Do you look like a prepubes-
cent girl? Do you sway your
hips when you walk? Do you
indulge in elaborate hand
gestures? Is your voice high
pitched? Do you dress flam-
boyantly? Sorry, no femmes
(unless you’re so hyperfem-
inine you fall into a fetish
category).
It is a very weird situation
to be in. Imagine you’ve just
come out, thinking you’ve left
all those people who belittle
your masculinity because
of your sexuality (gay men
aren’t real men), only to find
people who passive aggres-
sively belittle your masculinity
(I’m not into camp men. I just
don’t like it when gay men
play into the stereotype. If I
wanted a flamboyant man, I’d
be straight).
Yeah. Kinda awkward at
best. Soul-destroyingly dis-
gusting at worst.
So does masculinity affect
your sexual success? Proba-
bly. Should you be worried
about it? Probably not. Just
be yourself, ‘cause at the end
of the day, it doesn’t matter
how much you’re getting, if
you feel dead inside.
// For city boys,
mascing it up will
probably help //
// Do you have a
big dick? Prepare to

// Sorry, no femmes

hyperfeminine that

advantage //
men (just as straight men
prefer feminine women).
This pressure, contrary to
popular belief and despite (or
maybe because of) the gay
stereotype hypermasculinises
THE GAYS. As Greg Brown
from ASAPScience explains,
if masculinity is the approval
and acceptance from other
men, then gay men (who for
obvious reasons constantly
seek the approval of other
men) are hypermasculine.
So it’s fair to say the male
gay scene has a particu-
larly odd relationship with
masculinity. It glorifies and
define masculinity.
“But will looking masculine
get me laid?” It’s compli-
cated brah. Looking purely
at the sexual appeal of yo’
face, a 2014 study showed
that masculine faces were
more desirable in urban
environments, suggesting
that traditional Western
masculinity norms are socially
constructed and break down
in novel societies. Another
study found that beards are
more sought after in cities
with larger populations. So
for city boys, mascing it up
will probably help.
At the same time, don’t over
do it. Beards, for example,
are trendy and all that, but
a recent study suggests that
when it comes to hooking up,
