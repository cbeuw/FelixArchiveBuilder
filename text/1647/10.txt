t seems wearable tech is
becoming somewhat of
a fashion trend around
the world. And many
new products coming into
play this year take their
inspiration from the 1980s
film franchise: Back to The
Future. Nike were the first
to stun the world with the
first-ever line of self lacing
trainers, The HyperAdapt,
which they based on Marty
Mcfly’s footwear in the
second film. These trainers
have been designed with a
sensor located at the heel,
triggering the fitting process
when activated. The new
line will be available on
November 28th
with an initial
selling price of $720.
Another recent and exciting
development from the Univer-
sity of Central Florida, has

Going back to the future in style
Mention science and saving
lives and we often think of
scrubs, scalpels and open-
heart surgery. Joanne Beale
from Engineers Without
Borders, in her talk ‘Massive
Small Change in Mozam-
bique’ opens our eyes to the
fact that doctors are not the
only ones saving lives directly
– engineers are doing it too.
Joanne spent two and a
half years in Mozambique
on a project to ameliorate
water conditions. In a coun-
try where only 25% of the
population has access to safe
water, 20% of children had
consistently been dying of
diarrhea before they reached
the age of five, a direct result
of poor water conditions and
lack of sanitation. Joanne set
out with a simple mission: to
reduce this child mortality
rate by spreading information
on water sanitation, building
water wells and encouraging
the construction of latrines in
every house.
Joanne took on volunteers
from local communities and
educated them on water
safety, aiming to reach every
household to maximize
the effect. Most locals had
remarkably little knowledge
about water sanitation, with
commonplace methods of
purification, including boil-
ing, UV and chlorine being
almost unheard of. Only
30% of the local population
had any access to latrines
and common practices like
hand-washing before meals
were scarcely practiced.
Joanne’s educational
program revolutionized the
communities she touched
within just two years: 97%
of all households targeted
received aid, 75% of them
having functional latrines at
the end of the program and
water purification techniques
now being widespread
among 80% of the popu-
lation. This has resulted in
child mortality being cut by
more than half, a figure that
is expected to improve as
these measures reach more
communities.
What is truly remarkable
is with how few resources
and a virtually inexistent
government collaboration,
this was achieved. The only
paid member of the project
was a single field worker who
managed to train 15 local
volunteers, who themselves
Life-saving engineering
and experiences we are all
alone; as Tennessee Williams
put it, “We are all sentenced
to solitary confinement inside
our own skins, for life”.
Despite how scary and over-
whelming this all may seem,
the fact that we can function
and continue to question and
discuss these matters at all is
nothing short of incredible.
We as humans are unique
in our ability to question, to
debate, to discuss. I can ask
you how an apple tastes,
what pain feels like to you
or what colour a strawberry
is, but I will never be able to
experience any of it in the
same way you do. However,
we can continue to ask and
discuss and hopefully, some-
day, we will get there.
C
olour is an
illusion. When
we look at any
object, likely
the first thing
we notice about
it is its colour. Colours are
incredibly important to our
understanding of the world,
and we use them all the time
in art, film, photography,
and in science. Despite all
this however, it is a fact that
colours do not exist in the
external world. Colours are
not an intrinsic property of
any material, rather they
are the representation
that our minds produce of
the light given off by any
object. They do not exist
outside of our minds and
are simply our interpretation
of a certain range of the
electromagnetic spectrum;
as such, it is impossible to
detect or measure how you,
or in fact any other person,
experiences any colour.
This leads to an interesting
and rather scary idea: the
fact that different people
could perceive colours in
completely different ways.
For instance, imagine you and
I look at the same object, say
an orange. I would see the
colour I think of as orange,
but you could see the colour I
think of as blue; however, we
have both been brought up to
label that colour as “orange”.
So when asked what colour
the orange is, we both answer
correctly and say orange,
before parting to go about
our lives. But despite agreeing
on the colour, we have no
idea how very different our
experiences of the same
object were.
Let’s say I met a man who
was born blind. He would
have never experienced
seeing any colour, so I decide
to teach him about colours,
starting with light. I start from
the fundamentals, such as its
basic properties like wave-
length, frequency and speed,
and work my way to the more
complex, such as quantum
mechanics. I could teach him
every single equation to do
with light. I could teach him
the optical and opto-elec-
tronic properties of every
single material; that is, how
light interacts with materials.
I could teach him every single
descriptive word assigned to
every colour, and have him
memorise the exact range of
wavelengths for each colour.
I could even teach him every
biological process involved
in how our eyes and brains
process light, and how an
image or colour is formed in
the mind.
But he would never be able
to actually see or experience
any colour. I could tell him
that red was a hot, passionate
and angry colour. I could say
blue was cold, that green was
the colour of grass and blue
the colour of the sky. None of
this would matter. He would
never experience seeing
any sort of colour, no matter
how I described it. No colour
would ever appear in his
mind no matter what I said or
how I explained them to him.
These private, indescribable,
raw feelings or experiences
have been termed ‘qualia’
by philosophers, and we
seem to be utterly incapable
of expressing or explaining
them. This could be because
our languages are unable
to produce these qualia in
other people’s minds; and
given time and advances in
language and technology, we
could be able to accurately
describe a raw feeling and
have another person experi-
ence that same feeling.
Qualia, such as our per-
ceptions of colour, cannot
be measured with any tests
we devise. Other conditions,
such as colour blindness, are
different in that they cause
real-world effects in the
people affected. People with
colour blindness fail to see
things or differentiate colours
in a way that most people
can, so they can be tested
and diagnosed. However,
there could very easily be
many different ways of seeing
and experiencing colours,
which do not alter a person’s
behaviour or performance
in any tests we could devise.
In that case, there would be
people who prefer certain
colours or prefer certain
colour combinations, which
indeed currently happens.
This is extremely important,
as it shows that we can never
truly understand what any
other person experiences,
short of crawling into their
subconscious and expe-
riencing things from their
perspective first-hand. When
it comes to our perceptions
Qasim Mahmood examines the science behind seeing
colours, and why experiencing them may be visually
different for everyone

solar, nanotech-powered
clothing. The study, published
only days ago in Nature
Communications, has success-
fully weaved solar powered
filaments into textiles. This
comes from Associate Profes-
sor of nanotechnology Javan
Thomas, who mentioned Back
to the Future was a major
inspiration for him to “realise
those cinematic fantasies”.
The research builds upon
previous work conducted by
Mr. Thomas and his associ-
ates, where they developed
a cable not only capable
of transmitting energy, but
also storing it, rather than
requiring a grid or battery.
The team developed thin, flex-
ible and lightweight copper
ribbons, which are split
into two layers: one energy
storing layer; one solar cell
layer. Their groundbreak-
ing achievement removes a
major limitation to solar cell
portability, as the energy
flowing through them has
always required a battery for
storage. The proof-of-concept
was demonstrated using a
tabletop loom and a bit of
yarn.
Mr. Thomas’s work is likely
to revolutionize wearable
technology so far as allowing
us to charge our phones and
other gadgets with jackets or
coats by simply “sliding them
in a pocket”. Furthermore,
military applications would
be especially promising,
particularly for soldiers
stationed in desert climates.
These men must often trek
for days and carry up to 30
pounds of batteries on their
backs, which isn’t easy, even
in a calm, safe environment.
Other potential uses for this
novel technology include cars
that could function on solar
energy, store that energy and
re-charge themselves so long
as there is sunlight.
