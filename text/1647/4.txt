The US Election, a week on
felix gets out and about for your reactions too
Steve Bohnel

t’s been about a week
and a half since the U.S.
election was held. By now,
most of the world seems to
know that Donald Trump is
the president-elect of the
United States.
What isn’t as clear, however,
is how much he will scale
back from his hateful rhetoric
and proposed policies during
his year-and-a-half long
campaign.
Trump has revealed a lot
since his victory, some of which
was aired in a 60 Minutes
interview with Leslie Stahl on
American TV Sunday night.
But even with Trump’s
surprising victory, some
Imperial students aren’t
shocked – because they
haven’t been following along.
“There have been a lot of
pages in the news about it, but
I’ve been studying and trying
to get in publications and
papers,” said Caner Sahim,
a 27-year-old PH.D. student
studying electronics.
David O’Reilly, a 21-year-
old student in his fourth year
of chemistry, has also been
uninterested.
“I don’t follow politics at all,”
he said. “I’ve just never really
been interested … I really like
reading, specifically the fiction
genre.”
One idea many devastated
Americans have had is to
move to Canada because of
Trump’s victory. Alexis Boutin,
however, doesn’t think that will
work as well as some people
think.
“To be honest, I see all these
people moving to Canada,
but it’s such a different country
than the United States,”
said Boutin, a 23 year-old
Canadian studying finance
and accounting.
It also isn’t as easy as
Americans think to just move
north. The Washington Post, an
American newspaper based in
the nation’s capital, reported
that Americans will still need
a permanent resident’s visa
in order to move past the
Canadian border. In other
words: No visa, no entry.
power of stupid people in
large groups.’”
Much of the United States’
election has been front-page
news in newspapers across
England, especially leading
up to Election Day. Butler,
who said he voted for Clinton,
talked to numerous British
people about the election.
“It’s a mix,” Butler said about
British people’s reaction to
the news. “I think a majority
of people understand that
crazy things happen in our
government that Americans
don’t have control over.”
Some, however, “confuse
Americans with American
policy,” he added.
Marta Wolinska, an 18-year-
old ‘freshman’ studying
material science, said she saw
many similarities between
recent elections in her home
country Poland, Brexit, and
the U.S. election.
“I think it’s quite sad because
I feel like there’s this type of
voter who votes for those who
show the most hope, even if it’s
misplaced,” she said.

Reports in American
newspapers indicate that
Trump did rally lower-class
communities in rural areas
throughout the United States.
Wolinska said, however, that
the issue is that politicians tend
to not follow through on their
promises.
“People are going to say

Despite some students’ lack
ofinterestintheelection,others
have been following more
closely, including Ethan Butler,
27-year-old PH.D. student in
Chemical Engineering who is
originally from Connecticut.
Butler said that just like during
the election, it’s unclear what
will happen during the next
couple of months.
“One of the things about
this [election] specifically is
that with all these reporters
reporting on this, nobody
knows,” he said.
O’Reilly added that although
he didn’t follow the election,
he was surprised that Trump
won.
“I didn’t think he would get
that far,” he said. “I guess it
just reminds me of this quote,
‘Don’t underestimate the

his plan to build a wall along
the southern border between
Mexico and the states.
But in the 60 Minutes
interview on Sunday, he
conceded that some sections
of the wall may need to be a
fence.
He also said he might
not completely appeal
Obamacare – rather, that he
would eliminate parts of it and
keep clauses involving those
with pre-existing conditions.
And ultimately, despite
Trump’s victory, not every
Imperial student is fearing the
worst.
“It’s not going to be just
Trump making decisions,”
Boutin said. “He may have
been controversial during
the campaign, but he’s going
to have to get everything
approved… Congress may not
like what he does.”

world, and they don’t,” she
said.
It’s unclear how much Trump
will deviate from some of his
most radical policy proposals
during the campaign. His most
notable one, perhaps, was

past week, with a
public meeting being
held on November 29th
a
pivotal moment in the future of
healthcare provision in North
West London. The meeting, to
be held by Hammersmith &
Fulham Council is likely to be
key in gauging public support
for keeping the hospital open.
To understand just how
important this issue is to
residents, one only has to
explore the local picture. In
2014, control of H&F Council
changed hands, largely as a
result of debate over the future
of Charing Cross. Walking
through the borough, “Save
Our Hospitals – no votes here
for candidates that don’t listen”
posters adorn windows. Even
local celebrities, such as Bill
Bailey, are coming on board
the campaign. The Save Our
Hospitals group, previously
scoffed at by politicians,
is now regularly attending
Imperial College Trust board
meetings and scrutinising the
decisions they make; forcing
concessions on a range of
issues and bringing the debate
into the public eye.
The plans they oppose
come as part of the North
West London Sustainability
and Transformation Plan
(STP) – inspired by the Five
Year Forward Review for
the NHS – which places a
greater emphasis on the need
for increased primary care
provision, better IT facilities,
and education to enhance
general public health.
However, campaigners
contend that this shift is at
the expense of acute care,
and could be seen merely
as a cost-cutting exercise. A
key part of the STP will see

Whilst the government states
this is part of a wider goal to
equalise health outcomes
for people in different
communities, campaigners
contend that the issues run
much deeper. Sir Richard

decision to temporarily delay
demolition plans only came
about as a result of strong
public opposition. Now that
concessions are being made,
this is the time to continue to
apply pressure. But with the
entire nature of healthcare in
North West London certain to
change under these proposals,
this is a cause all Imperial
students – not just medics –
need to rally behind.

“the issue is funding” and
that “there isn’t the capacity”

the hesitance from the Save

the proposals.
The plan is touted to save
£1.3 billion between now
and 2021, forming a vital
part of the government’s plan
to find £22 billion worth of
