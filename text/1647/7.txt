Horsemen of the
Trumpocalypse

Avirup Banerjee points the finger of
blame for the Trump presidency
L
ast Wednesday the world woke to
darkness – a fascist, misogynistic,
anti-semitic, Islamophobic, racist,
sexual assaulter who has called
Mexicans rapists, made fun of
a reporter’s disability, praised
every dictator under the sun from Putin
to Kim Jong-Un, ridiculed the heroism of
prisoners of war, called for the banning
of all Muslims, urged carpet bombing
the Middle East, questioned the need to
preserve NATO, asserted that climate
change is a hoax perpetrated by the
Chinese, threatened the 1st
Amendment
rights of free speech by promising to jail
journalists and paying the legal fees of his
supporters beating up peaceful protesters,
and prided himself on his sexual abuse of
women. Quite a mouthful, but only a thin
veneer of what is Donald Trump.
So how did we get from Barack Obama
to Donald Trump?
Trump’s victory can be attributed to four
main factors: failures of the Democratic
party, the incompetence of the media, ex-
ternal intervention by Russia and the polit-
icisation of the FBI.
Hillary Clinton was correct; Trump’s sup-
porters do fill up the basket of the deplor-
able of American society. They are the
heirs of the Know Nothings and the Con-
federacy of the nineteenth century by op-
erating through fear. Yes, the Republican
Party has, for over 40 years, employed the
race-baiting southern strategy predicated
on whipping up xenophobic white voters
against all minorities. This is most evident
in the disenfranchisement of poor Afri-
can-American and Latino voters by purg-
ing thousands from the voter rolls in swing
states like Indiana and North Carolina,
and by closing over 800 voting stations in
Democratic districts in Arizona and North
Carolina. All of these were accomplished
due to the Supreme Court, in its infinite wis-
dom, gutting the Voting Rights Act.
Even with this ugly history of the Republi-
can party, Trump’s rise is still unprecedent-
ed. The last four Republican candidates
– Romney, McCain, Bush and Bob Dole
– are paragons of virtue compared to this
lunatic. Trump has emboldened the hidden
racist vote and normalised it like nothing
before, not even condemning the KKK. But
this was also the country that twice elected
an African American with the middle name
Hussain. So, whilst the moral bankruptcy
of the Republican party was in clear sight,
the failure of the Democratic party must
too be examined.
In the end, Trump won the elec-
toral college through his strength
in the industrial ‘rust belt’ of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wis-
consin, the latter three of which
hadn’t gone to the Republicans
since 1988. In these states, real (in-
flation adjusted) median wage has
stagnated since 1980, and only this
year were there any signs of im-
provements. This was in large part
due to the trickledown economics
of Ronald Reagan. Ironically how-
ever, it was presidents Bill Clinton
and Barack Obama who pushed
through significant right-wing leg-
islation that the Republicans never
could, by neutralising the political
left. In the process, they also alien-
ated the Democratic base.
It was Bill Clinton’s legislation that
deregulated Wall Street by repeal-
ing the Glass Steagall Act, which
protected depositors’ money from
investment banks. When George
H. W. Bush failed to get NAFTA
through Congress, it was Bill Clinton
who subdued the unions and crip-
pled the manufacturing industry. It
was Clinton’s crime bill that brought
the era of mass incarceration of
minorities, resulting in the fall of
African American voter turnout be-
cause of the lingering resentment.
It was the Clinton welfare bill that
cut benefits for the poor and thus,
for the first time in a generation,
white working class voters rejected
the Democrats. It is Barack Obama
who has deported more Latinos
than any other president, so was it
surprising that Trump won as many
Latinos as Romney did?
Hillary Clinton only received 55%
of the millennial vote, which is down
from Obama’s 60% in 2012. This is
because many young voters are
frustrated by Clinton’s close associ-
ation with Wall Street and her pre-
vious military hawkishness in Iraq
and Libya.
Even with the faults of the Dem-
ocratic Party, both Barack Obama
and Bill Clinton were great presi-
dents and Secretary Clinton was
still an impressive candidate with
experience and espousing progres-
sive policies in education, health-
care and climate change, let alone
being the first female candidate for
the presidency in a major party.
One thing that is certain is that the
media need to own this outcome.
This is their Frankenstein’s monster,
and perhaps the problem was their
discomfort with the idea of a strong
female leader.

This is about the Hong Kong
government’s inability to up-
hold justice, rule of law, and
separation of powers, which
are core principles of a func-
tioning democracy.
Firstly, while the NPCSC has
always had the power to inter-
pret the Basic Law, there are
set provisions for this power
Y
ou think the US
election was the
a p o c a l y p s e ?
Take a look at
Hong Kong.
Hong Kong
recently had its Legislative
Council (LegCo) elections, in
which two candidates from
the Youngspiration party, Le-
ung and Yau, were elected.
It is important to note that
their platforms focus heavi-
ly on achieving democratic
self-determination for the fu-
ture of Hong Kong. The two
elected legislators then had
the brilliant idea of protesting
through their oaths. Stand-
ing in front of a “Hong Kong
is NOT China” banner, they
took their oaths while replac-
ing “People’s Republic of Chi-
na” with “people’s re-fucking
of Chee-na”, Chee-na being a
derogatory term used by the
Empire of Japan against Chi-
na.
However, the Department of
Justice suddenly filed for a ju-
dicial review of the chair’s de-
cision to allow for the second
oath, completely disregarding
the authority of the LegCo
Chair as well as the most ba-
sic of government principles:
separation of powers. Yet
supporters of the government
argue that the Basic Law does
not explicitly mention separa-
tion of powers.
Rita Fan, a pro-Beijing politi-
cian, stated that the Basic Law
only guarantees judicial inde-
pendence, “meaning that ju-
dicial decisions should not be
affected by the government or
any influential people in Hong
Kong.” Yet even before the
court could make a decision
on the judicial review case, the
National People’s Congress
Standing Committee (NPCSC)
used its power to interpret the
Basic Law, specifically Article
104 regarding oath-taking, as
follows:
“No public office shall be as-
sumed … by anyone who fails
to lawfully and validly take the
oath or who declines to take
the oath.”
“An oath taker must take the
Their oaths were deemed in-
valid by the LegCo Chair and

oaths at the next Council meet-
ing. This was not the first time
that a Legislator would have
been allowed to retake their
oath.
protesters and the police, rem-
iniscent of the Umbrella Rev-
olution. Bricks were thrown,
pepper was sprayed, people
were arrested, freedoms were
crushed. Just the usual in the
Special Administrative Region.
There aren’t many options
left for the people of Hong
Kong. Accept the status quo
and watch our liberties, free-
doms, and rule of law slowly
deteriorate. Give up, and let
Hong Kong become the Chi-
nese City of Xianggang. Or
we could fight back. The ques-
tion is how? How do we fight
against a growing superpow-
er with a choking grip in every
nook and cranny of our belov-
ed city? Peaceful protests and
even riots have proven ineffec-
tive in the past, so what’s next?
What can we do when every
level of society from universi-
ties to the Legislative Council
is segregated politically?
I certainly don’t have an
answer for these steeping
questions, but I sincerely and
solemnly hope that it isn’t
“nothing”. In the meantime, all
I can do is helplessly sit here
and watch my home slowly
fall apart, brick by brick, law
by law.
oath sincerely and solemnly,
and must accurately, com-
pletely and solemnly read out
the oath prescribed by law.”
“An oath taker is disqualified
forthwith from assuming the
public office specified in the
Article if he or she declines to
take the oath.”
“If the oath taken is deter-
mined as invalid, no arrange-
ment shall be made for retak-
ing the oath.”
Supporters of the govern-
as listed in Article 158, which
state that the courts of the Re-
gion shall seek an interpreta-
tion through the Court of Final
Appeal if it concerns “affairs
which are the responsibility of
the Central People’s Govern-
ment, or concerning the rela-
tionship between the Central
Authorities and the Region”.
Nothing within Article 104 cor-
responds to those two criteria,
making this an obvious step
taken by the Central People’s
Government to deny not only
the two legislators in question,
but also any other candidates
of public office that they deem
unfit, according to their own
interpretation. What makes an
oath sincere and solemn? This
gives the person administering
the oath the power to disquali-
fy anyone they would like.
Trump may have said that
he wouldn’t accept the results
of the election, but the fright-
ening reality in Hong Kong is
that the government now has
the power to actually deny the
results of a democratic elec-
tion and ‘post-select’ candi-
dates. Furthermore, this inter-
pretation before the end of the
court case is a clear violation
of the judicial independence
of the Hong Kong judiciary. In
the end, the courts will rule in
agreement with the interpreta-
tion, and this ruling will serve
as a precedent for all future
cases, effectively validating
the ‘post-selection’ method.
That night, between 8000
(police estimate) and 13000
(organisers estimate) people
protested against the inter-
pretation. This devolved into
violent clashes between the
ment insist that the NPCSC’s
power to interpretation is writ-
ten in the law, the interpreta-
tion has simply cleared up the
misunderstandings regarding
Article 104, and people with
nothing to hide shouldn’t have
to fear an interpretation. Addi-
tionally, they argue that oppo-
nents of the interpretation are
doing so in support of the two
legislators’ actions.
But there’s the thing: I couldn’t
give less of a fuck about those
two idiots. This story has esca-
lated far past the fate of Leung
and Yau, whose political ca-
reers are without a doubt over.
