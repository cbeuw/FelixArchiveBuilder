We’veallgotdaddyissues
C
hange is in the air. Imperial College has
taken up recommendations to improve
student satisfaction made by the Union,
the Higher Education and Research Bill
has just been amended, an education
demo is taking place in London this
weekend, and Donald Trump’s backtracking behaviour
has captured the public’s imagination anew. But
enough of that, this issue is the daddy issue, the issue
where we explore our complex relationship with our
fathers, our constant pursuit for their approval, our
personal struggle: our masculinity.
Masculinity is a bizarre concept. Though I’m
someone who has struggled with it their whole life I
still don’t feel confident addressing it. I still think many
essential elements surrounding masculinity discourse
escape me. This became painfully evident whilst trying
to write a feature this week, as I realised that my views
on the masculine were not quite as clear in my head as
I thought they were.
Regardless of my questionable attempt at creating
#content, we think this is a relevant time to have some
discussion on this topic, as International Men’s Day
is fast approaching (19th
of November), moustaches
are popping up like mushrooms nationwide in an
effort to combat prostate and testicular cancer (the
Movember phenomenon), and the Southbank Centre
is dedicating a full three days this weekend to discuss
“the challenges and pressures of masculine identity”
in an event aptly named Being A Man (BAM).
And we really should be talking about the masculine
norms a lot of us are knowingly or unknowingly
constrained by. How so many aspects of our culture,
our life (even our sex life) are affected by masculinity.
How it’s not expected of us to openly and critically
discuss such issues. So, talk we shall.
