Grammar
schools are not
the answer
Husain Al-Jabir gives his first-hand
opinion of Grammar schools
D
isclaimer: I’m
an alumnus of
a well-known
North London
g r a m m a r
school, having
joined in the sixth form from a
high achieving comprehensive
school. I’ve studied under both
school systems, coming out the
other side with insights into
each. No-one could accuse
me of not being qualified
enough to speak about the
virtues and pitfalls of the
grammar system. A significant
number of Imperial students
attended grammars and most
likely support the grammar
system, either vociferously
or nonchalantly; however, I
wonder if from the privilege of
your educational bubble, you
have ever looked outside?
Under the guise of ‘edu-
cational overhaul’, the Tory
and coalition governments
through the actions of former
resident government snake
Mr Michael Gove and his suc-
cessor Nicky Morgan, as ed-
ucation secretary, have been
responsible for scrapping the
integrated AS-Level, trying to
force every school to become
an ‘Academy’, and completely
redesigning GCSEs with effec-
tively zero notice. The latest
brainwave by our illustrious –
and need we mention unelect-
ed – Prime Minister Theresa
May, is to dispense with forty
years of alternately overt and
implicit educational policy, by
paving the way for the reintro-
duction of that most divisive of
schools: The Grammar school.
For the Scots, Welsh, or
Northerners among you,
Grammar schools are meant
to represent a progressive uto-
pia – poor but brilliant eleven
year olds are to be offered an
education akin to their rich pri-
vately-educated counterparts
in specialist schools where en-
try is based solely on academ-
ic merit. These brilliant chil-
dren would be able to reach
their potential without (heaven
forbid!) the less erudite drag-
ging them down. They would
of course be selected using
the most accurate measure
of intelligence known to man
– the eleven plus entrance
exam, serving as the key to the
future. Pass it and a world of
opportunity opens, but fail it
and the doors are bolted shut.
The problem of this vision is
that the eleven plus exam is far
from a level playing field for
all students, acting more as a
class separator than a discrim-
inator of intelligence. As any-
one who has sat exams such
as the UKCAT, MAT, or their
ilk will know that tutoring is
omnipresent and shoved into
your face at every opportunity
(shout out Medify). No matter
how ‘tuition-proof’ these ex-
ams claim to be, the availabili-
ty of resources and practice to
families with the means to pay
far outstrips the poor with po-
tential. Anecdotally, this leads
to a middle-class invasion and
infiltrative classism with clear
consequences on students. It’s
not without reason that Tat-
ler, a traditional magazine of
the wealthy has published a
list of top state schools, most
of which are grammars –
why waste money on Private
school tuition when tutoring
for the 11+ is cheaper? Gram-
mars have become an outpost
of the rich at the expense of
others.
The Grammar school I went
to was situated in a deprived
area, surrounded by poorly
achieving comprehensives.
Consequently, almost every-
one in the local area took
the test to try and get in, else
they would have to resort to
the failing local secondaries.
You might expect then, that
my school would have people
from the local area? In actu-
al fact, I could count on two
hands the number of people
who lived within walking dis-
tance to my school. Hundreds
of kids are bussed in from the
surrounding areas commuting
for up to 45 minutes. If you’ve
ever commuted to uni, you
already know the negative
impacts of this; if you haven’t,
relying on two daily school
buses to get there, effectively
preventing you from partaking
in after-school activities, isn’t
much fun at all. Schools should
have a strong link to their local
area, with intake coming from
the local children and deeply
involved in local society. How
can grammars possibly have
a link to the local community
when three-quarters of their
students come from an entirely
separate borough?
Grammars suck the intel-
ligent and rich out of local
schools, leading to a high
achieving enclave within
a failing school area. Poor
school results lead to difficul-
ty recruiting excellent staff,
and wealthier families choose
to move away to other areas,
contributing to the isolation
of the school community. The
result is a vicious cycle of fail-
ure and decline, from which

London’s secondaries are only
recently escaping.
It appears to me that a far
simpler solution, benefiting
the masses and preventing
the deepening of social di-
vide, is simply to try and raise
standards across the board.
I was fortunate enough to
attend an excellent compre-
hensive school; indeed, its re-
sults ranked among grammar
schools even though it takes
everyone in from the local
community. Teaching quality
was on a par with the gram-
mar, but with wider benefits
for the entire school popula-
tion. There is no reason that
other students around the
country cannot benefit from
the same education, save for
Mrs May’s idealism.
We’ve tried grammar
schools before, and they don’t
work. The 163 educational rel-
ics scattered across England
are not models to be revered,
but products of a bygone age.
Perhaps we ought to spend
less time shoving students
between new educational
models every few years, and
actually invest in the teaching
profession. Segregation is not
the solution.
