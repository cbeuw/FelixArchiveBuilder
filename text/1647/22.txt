According to video games, masculinity means being a buff alpha male with a simple,
strong but silent demeanor. Is this what masculinity is all about?

characters with a ‘shoot
first and ask questions later’
mentality. It’s understandable
that this is catering to the
somewhat aggressive nature
that resides in everyone, but
at the same time it’s doing a
brilliant job of painting a very
grim image of male nature
and masculinity in general.
I admit, these are games
after all, and it’d be boring
as heck if every conflict was
resolved by talking it out. The
issue is most games have very
I
n the olden times, the
world was in a very
different place. Just look
at old stories and folk-
tales to get an idea; they
always sprang out of
the aspirations and concerns
of the time. After centuries
of storytelling, it can get
pretty tricky to cut those
bonds. Obviously, society has
massively evolved and moved
on from then, however video
games are still struggling to
catch up.
Everyone knows female rep-
resentation isn’t exactly ideal
in games, but the same is also
true for men. Both physically
and attitude-wise, we’re
almost always given a one-di-
mensional portrait of men in
video games substitute brains
for brawn.
Games are, first and
foremost, a visual medium,
and when you’ve got action-
heavy adventures, you get
impossibly bulky and beefy
characters. Predominantly all
male characters are depicted
this way, as muscular and
hulking. You could look at this
as appealing to the gamer
mindset, giving them an
opportunity to be someone
with great physical prowess
that would take years of
effort to obtain in real life.
I, myself, don’t find these
designs personally threaten-
ing, though it doesn’t mean
that such representations
aren’t downright silly and,
potentially, prevent games
from being treated seriously
as an art form. Besides, men
aren’t the only people who
play video games, so it’s no
good having this unrealistic
masculinity portrayal as the
standing norm.
Even more harmful than the
appearance of these char-
acters is their attitudes. A lot
of characters have as much
personality as those created
by Stephenie Meyer. It sort of
makes sense why characters
are written this way; males
have traditionally been
portrayed as destructive (just
look at history). However,
it’s one thing to beautifully
portray the glory of physical
hardship, it’s quite another
to use violence as a means
of getting from one point to
another.
There are female charac-
ters with violent tendencies,
for sure. But it’s so much
more common to see male
‘13-year old’ thoughts of how
men resolve conflict. Also,
when violence has no context
or reason, or is the only way
to go forward, things become
problematic.
Yet games are slowly
becoming more and more
story driven and with this
births more complex charac-
ters who bring out different
and more appealing sides
of masculinity. For example,
in the Mass Effect series, the
character of Shepard brings a
lot of depth to the quintessen-
tial leader role as he deals
with the dichotomy of leader-
ship: ruthlessness and nobility.
Both sides deal with the
burden and eventual after-
math of choice. This caters to
a man’s instinct to take charge
and lead, not necessarily like
an alpha male, but more so
as someone in an influential
and superior position.
Another character who
highlights a different side of
masculinity in video games
is Nathan Drake from the
Uncharted series. This series
reminds us that ‘boys’ know
how to do one thing very
well: have fun. Nathan Drake
is vibrant, well dialogued,
and a fun every-man, taking
the adventure from one stage
to the next. Adventurous char-
acters like him remind us that
it’s the journey, with trials and
obstacles along the way, that
matter. It’s man’s nature to
journey outward and explore;
while this isn’t much possible
in modern society, films and
video games help satiate this
Fallacies of masculinity in games
thirst for adventure. While
some games may still have
the aforementioned faux that
tarnishes the image of mascu-
linity, games like Uncharted
play up the other features
that can appeal to us.
Games have still a long way
to go, especially compared to
other forms of media. While
at the end of the day, games
are just simple fun, it can be
difficult to ignore the ways
they misrepresent men and
masculinity. It’s inevitable that
games will grow with their
audience, but until that time,
it’s best to praise and enjoy
the developers giving depth
and complexity to male char-
acters while ignoring the ones
who can’t get their heads out
of seventh grade.
