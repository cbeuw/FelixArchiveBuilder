What the Brexit
ruling means for
our democracy
Callum Hunter welcomes parliament’s
involvement in the Brexit process
O
n the 3rd
No-
vember, the
High Court
h a n d e d
down a de-
cision stating
that the Government need-
ed parliamentary approval
before triggering Article 50.
Whilst the Brexiteers have
made an outcry, stating that
this is a breach of democra-
cy, it is actually a vindica-
tion of the United Kingdom’s
parliamentary sovereignty,
something they campaigned
for earlier this year. We must
therefore use this judgement
to push the Remain camp’s
ideas to the forefront, so that
they are not neglected as they
have been so far.
The government, that is Ms.
May’s cabinet, believed they
could use an ancient law,
known as the crown preroga-
law. The parliamentary law
that must first be overturned is
the 1972 EU communities act.
As a result, the government
needs parliament’s approval
on their Brexit plan before the
article can be triggered. This
is all down to the fact that, as
Lord Lester QC amply sums
up, “ministers are accountable
to parliament and the courts
for the way they use their pub-
lic powers.”
This all comes together to
reaffirm, certainly in my mind,
that the constitution of this
country works to serve the
people, and to hear all of our
voices.
Alas, there has been an
outcry, best demonstrated by
newspapers such as The Daily
Mail and The Daily Telegraph.
There were, and still are,
claims that the judges who
passed down the ruling are
“out of touch with the coun-
try” and “enemies of the peo-
ple.” It is ironic then that the
parliamentary sovereignty the
Leave campaigners fought so
hard for has come back to bite
them in a place where the sun
has certainly never shone.
This ruling, however, will
serve all the people of the UK
well. It will seek to serve not
only the Remain campaign,
but also the Leave campaign,
as they finally have the ‘sover-
eignty’ that they so longed for.
Nigel Farage fears that this
ruling means we may be head-
ing for a ‘half Brexit.’ I am
certainly hoping for such an
outcome, given that, basically,
half of the country voted to re-
main. What is more, surely this
ruling is exactly what Farage,
Johnson and Davis were hop-
ing for, handing the power
upon a large variety of var-
iables. Everything from the
will of a party to whip votes,
down to conviction of each
and every MP. However, what
I can tell you is that Brexit may
be on course for a bumpy ride.
At this moment in time, Jeremy
Corbyn has been unclear as
to whether he intends to whip
votes in the Labour party,
and it seems unlikely that he
would. If other parties follow
suit, and MPs stick to their orig-
inal stance, then it will be 479
for Remain and 156 for Leave,
leading to a complete halt of
Brexit.
This may sound undemocrat-
ic and ridiculous, but I wel-
come it. In most other coun-
tries a vote of 66.7% or above
would be required to trigger a
constitutional change without
parliamentary approval; or a
joint vote between the people
and parliament would be re-
quired. Why is it then that only
52% – a margin that could

may be heading
for a ‘half Brexit’.
I am certainly
hoping so, given
that half the
country voted to

back to parliament. Unfortu-
nately, the ruling isn’t on their
side. As a result, petty whining
has ensued from the right-wing
press. As a consequence, the
people who wanted Brexit
would now like the power to
be thrust unto them and par-
liament left out of the negotia-
tions. I call hypocrisy.
The question now is, what
does this ruling really mean
for Brexit?
That question is a tough one
to answer as it is dependent

tive, to trigger Article 50 with-
out parliamentary approval.
However, since this law cannot
be used to affect parliamenta-
ry laws, Article 50 cannot be
triggered using the medieval
um of their MPs and lobbying.
This is a glimmer of hope.
We can finally make parlia-
ment truly work for us, and
make sure they are not “out
of touch” when they make
the coming decisions. This rul-
ing holds hope that we can
have easily swung the other
way – is enough? Surely that
is the unconstitutional thing
here.
The ruling is a welcome sight
in a sea of never ending strug-
gles towards Brexit. It gives
Remainers the hope that their
voice will actually be heard in
the Brexit negotiations.
I believe that we are on the
cusp on getting a deal which is
not only focused on the Leave
campaigns ideals, but on the
ideals of the 479 MPs, and
over 16 million people, who
voted to remain. With parlia-
mentary approval needed, the
people can have their voices
truly heard through the medi-

achieve a ‘half Brexit,’ just like
the ‘half leave’ we saw on the
24th
June.
This is an opportunity we
cannot let go of, we must uti-
lise it and push our agenda
forward to parliament. We
have seen that the constitu-
tion of this country is alive
and kicking, despite the leave
camp’s attempts to suppress it,
so we must use it.

lan Thomas, “we will not go

repeated 24/7 the avalanche of
lies directed at her for the last 30
years. Hillary Clinton was right
when she said there was a vast right
wing conspiracy against her, with
the media serving as an echo cham-
ber for everything from bogus scan-
dals, such as the nonsense about
her emails, to blaming her and even
calling her an “enabler” of her hus-
band’s infidelity in the 1990s. The
icing on the cake was the crazy
Trump conspiracy of Hillary Clinton
murdering her close friend, Vince
Foster, who had tragically commit-
ted suicide (which was confirmed
by three federal investigations).
In the 1950s it took the courage
of journalist Edward R. Murrow and
the respected army counsel Joseph
Welch asking “have you no decen-
cy, sir?” to shame Joseph McCarthy
and awaken America to the division
he was creating. Sadly, today’s me-
dia has no such stalwarts, and in-
stead the corporate TV executives
chasing after ratings provided
Trump with over two billion dollars
of free media coverage. Worst of
all were the inlets like CNN with
their pseudo objectivity normalising
Trump by creating a false equiva-
lence.
However, the scariest contributor
to the result is the fact that Russia
has been able to do what the Soviet
Union had never even come close
to doing – placing a puppet in the
White House. Russia just won the
Cold War 27 years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall. Vladimir Putin had
two accomplices in his pursuit of
destroying American democracy:
Julian Assange and the FBI.

Assange’s WikiLeaks which
hacked the private emails of only
the Democrats, only leaked private
messages from within the Clinton
campaign to the willing media. Last-
ly, the FBI Director James Comey,
breaking with all precedent, violat-
ed the Hatch Act and used the ma-
chinery of the FBI to interfere with
this election. The reopening of the
politically charged email investiga-
tion only ten days before election
day swung the pendulum in Trump’s
favour. Trump has already prom-
ised to jail his opponents, including
Clinton, and destroy the independ-
ence of the judiciary, so it seems
that Trump won’t have to create his
own Gestapo, but merely inherit an
FBI overflowing with extreme alt-
right agents.
In 1964 when the far-right candidate
Barry Goldwater lost in a landslide, the
Republican party, instead of moderating,
doubled down on conservatism, and con-
sequently went on to win the next five of the
six general elections. On the other hand,
when the great liberal George McGovern
lost to Richard Nixon for opposing the Vi-
etnam War, Democrats accepted defeat
and surrendered to the neo-con foreign
policies of Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Lib-
erals must learn to be as committed to our
beliefs as conservatives are to theirs –
standing up to Trump and pursuing social
justice, international peace and diversity.
America is a great country, and the odor-
ous slime of Mr Trump might stain it for
now, but as hope rises again the stench will
wash away, because the future of Ameri-
ca lies in its youth, which overwhelmingly
rejected the politics of fear. This is the last
hurrah for the racist old white man. Since
the revolution of 1776, Americans have
endured horrors from genocide against
Native Americans to slavery and civil war,
from the Great Depression to WWII – and
every single time America has come back
stronger in the everlasting pursuit of build-
ing a more perfect union.
Now as Liberals, we must stand with our
brothers and sisters of America, who are
in the front lines of this war. In closing, I
would like to thank Hillary Clinton and Tim
Kaine for running a campaign with hon-
our, and especially to Mrs Clinton for her
many years of service for America and the
rest of the world. Whilst the glass ceiling
may not have been shattered today, con-
solation may be found in the popular vote,
which she won by a margin of more than
200,000.
In the words of Martin Luther King Jr,
“I’ve been to the mountaintop, and I want
you to know tonight, that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land”. Therefore in
that spirit, nothing can stop an idea whose
time has come, for America will have a fe-
male president sooner than we all might
think.
