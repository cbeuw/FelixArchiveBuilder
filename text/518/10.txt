R E V I E W S !
Having worked out which is the front
cover and which the editor's tribute to the Sex
Pistols, the unsuspecting reader turns to
page 3 of the '80-'81 AP and is greeted by a
stark warning of the dangers of 'drifting' into
higher education (in type of a size which
would do credit to the front page of 'The
Sun').
By the time the reader reaches P6 and this
time the type is laid longitudinally (nudge-
nudge, do I detect Mel Kinkie's influence?)
He/she is going to be well aware ofthe pitfalls
of an ill-considered choice made at the 'A-
L e v e l C r o s s r o a d s ' f o l l o w i n g s c h o o l
education. Somewhere the editor found
somebody to write about 'Life outside
education' (reluctantly admitting that some
students 'Might feel sufficiently attracted to
them to join' - The forces or the police!)
which article also includes the broad
generalisation 'Just remember - your degree
is not to qualify you for any particular job' -
still it does highlight the need to face 'reality'
sooner or later in life and to have the courage
and foresight to consider what is going to
occupy your 50-odd post university years.
More warnings of drawbacks of IC (and the
recourses available when things go wrong)
follow, and the anarchistic streak shows
through again with a snide anti-scholarship
quip, just to remind the potential applicant
that the long-haired, anti-establishment,
chipped-shouldered, bloody-mindedness of
the 60s campuses has lasted through a whole
decade - still, such personal views are
inevitable, till we get an alternative AP!!
Before the longest, and to my mind, most
important section 'The Courses', comes more
information, on student media Mr Jarvis,
what happend to your organ?, College
entertainment, no mention of the C C U s , or
even !C U G M s here! arid a page of near
lavatory humour, to reassure the 'Carry-on'
freaks that no potential bog-artist need feel
constipated at IC provided he/she has a felt-
marker handy... Also appearing on P 11 is
'Shit' the first 4 letter word of the AP!!
Next is one of the best double pages, with
excellent articles on women, gays, and
overseas students (all of whom must feel
oppressed to various extents). The first
article is very accurate though not, I felt,
calculated to attract more women to IC, thus
'improving' the ratio - still, could we, in all
conscience do this?
Next follows 'The Union Building and
College Bars' - which is very informative, but
contains certain things not all IC students
would agree with - 'The Union Bar
unfortunately still has a certain male
dominated atmosphere' and on refectories,
'Despite the high prices, the quality of the
food can be disgusting'.(Complete with the
boycott-poster pigswill full frontal Mooney
picture - the 'Meal' specially ordered by
Malcolm Brain for full atrocity effect!)
'The courses' is next: 33 fact-filled pages
written by students of the College and
s u p p l y i n g i n f o r m a t i o n u n d e r s t a n d a b l y
absent from the offical college prospectus
a b o u t i n a d e q u a c i e s of e x a m i n i n g
techniques, staff-student relations, social
and academic problems etc. It seems a pity
though, that some courses have a much more
detailed 'write-up' than others and that
subsections are not the same from one article
to the next?!.
A n article on South Africa starts by
examining the 'Pros' of working there, but
these seem to be drowned by the subsequent
Page 11
'cons', the article concluding: 'Any company
in S. A frica must operate under the system of
apartheid, and is therefore propping up the
economic system of that country'.
Next follows 'IC Union' (again starting in
type rather too large to be easily digested) -
again informative, but rather biased towards
A C C at the expense of S C A B , R C C and S C C .
The C C U s page is amazingly balanced and
reasonable, h i g h l i g h t i n g their c r u c i a l
function in breaking the ice initially, and even
admitting that C C U s are 'Wot to everyone
taste'. This page concludes with a note on
ICWA and is marred only by the persistent
mispunctuating of ' C C U s ' (still, if it dissuades
pedants like myself from coming to IC, you
may be spared such people in the future...).
Now follow 11 excellent pages on
accommodation of all types - although even
an apology for the depressing air of this
section (on p57) fails to allay my concern at
the possible counter-productive effects of
statements like 'in truth things are pretty bad
and getting worse'.
Only at the 11th hour and 64th page does
the sixth-former come face to face with the
editor 'AP Supremo' Roger Stotesbury. To his
credit he got elected ICU Hon Sec before this
A P came out (what do you mean thats why he
held it back?)
In conclusion this book contains a wealth
of information and is visually very attractive
and extremely well packaged. In order to be
of maximum value, an A P must from time to
time express opinions and inevitably these
will be contentious on occasion. While many
sections (especially 'The courses') owe a lot
to previous APs, this edition does contain
much that is new and immediately relevant,
and if only to admire the layout and
presentation I would urge you to have a look
at a copy and follow our A P Piper along his
yellow-brick walkway to a better informed
fresher entry, and a happier and more fulfilled
student body.

T h i s message is to be found on the
label of the new Ian D u r y a l b u m , 'Do It
Y o u r s e l f , released today, and he is
right, it does not resemble his previous
work at all. In fact, if this had not been
'The new Ian D u r y A l b u m ' , I wouldn't
probably have given it a second listen,
which would have been sad indeed.
