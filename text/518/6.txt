Dracula's m o u t h would have watered at the Annual General
Meeting of the Royal College of Science Union last week.
For the m a i n ingredient ofthe initiation mix was five gallons
of bull's blood - and it was not the well known H u n g a r i a n wine
of that name.
While the three R C S chefs were preparing the mix for the
initiation of next year's Executive, the meeting elected Zosia
Zbrzezniak as Assistant H o n o r a r y Secretary and Rich Archer
as Entertainments Committee C h a i r m a n .
Social colours went to 30 people who were considered to have
made a special contribution to Union life this year. These
include Liz Lindsay and Rae Snee, and exceptionally a non'
Union m e m b e r , Annie Lathaen, one of the IC Union staff.
R C S U President Chris Fox received a U n i o n General A w a r d ex-
oliieio. He also presented awards to Sean O'Boyle and Jerry Swain to
reward their exceptional service to R C S U .
The Dervck Bond M e m o r i a l A w a r d went to A n d y French. This is a
lavatory seat which he has to wear round his neck at R C S bar nights.
Meanwhile the three chefs. Barney M c C a b e , J i m Sarsfield and Dak-
H o w a r d , were adding such choice delicacies to the initiation mix as
assorted fish organs, mashed raw potatoes a n d " M r s . Watsons amazing
Malaysian prawns" Ingredients were limited only by the constraint
that thev had to be or once hare been edible. "

H o w closely the final "mystery
ingredient" truly fitted that
d e s c r i p t i o n w a s p e r h a p s
debatable. The liquid had been
donated by an R C S student and
was not unconnected with human
reproduction.
The initiation procedure was
not without its unscheduled
mishaps. T o obtain the bull's
blood the chefs had journeyed to
Watford abattoir, but confusion
about the relative locations ol
Watford and the Watford G a p
meant that they drove almost as
far as Nottingham before they
realised that they might have
gone slightly too lar up the M l .
The initiation started with the
new executive of Sean O'Bovle.

out of the three-handled pot.
T h e n the three were painted in
b l a c k . w h i t e a n d l i l a c .
Unfortunately lot them an error
by Barnev M e C a b e meant that
gloss paint was used which proved
very difficult to wash off.
A liberal dousing of the
initiation mix was the next
pleasure to hit them. Finally
U n i o n members proceeded to the

Executive, by now very stick) and
smelly, probably welcomed their
penetration of the water's surface.

On Thursday the 10th the world's attention was focused on London for
the Jeremy Thorpe trial and, more importantly, the RSMUAGM. On
display was a 12 ft Spanner (courtesy of C & GU) and Andy Lewis,
resplendent in GIT-embroidered underwear, entertained (?) the masses
by thrashing a guitar and singing? Then followed the awarding of
colours - U.G.As were received by J. Hicks, P.J. Hoddinott, A. Lewis and
S. Potter.
The assembled multitude then thrilled to the transfer of power from
Andy Megaphone Lewis, John Hicks and Pete Birdman Hoddinott to
Chris Sleap, Trev Fletcher and Bernie Pryor.
Afterwards the old and new execs thrashed across a rather cold and
wet Serpentine in the traditional race.
A few hours, and several pints, later the ordered calm of R S M Barnight
was shattered by a seething mass of shrieking scientists who blinded us
all with their dazzling mediocrity.
A certain individual, who will remain anonymous (because Trev's
bigger than me), then demonstrated the folk art of Table Mounting.
By closing time the Minesmen (oops) Mines persons had asserted
their supremacy by outdrinking and out-singing the res rabble.
Congratulations must go to Andy, John and Pete for the extremely
successful past year and best wishes to Chris, Trev and Bernie for the
next one.

The Albert Memorial drenched
in sun and beer was the stage for
Tuesday's Guilds Handover
Union Meeting. The curtain went
up and the trousers came down. In
f r o n t of B e e t h o v e n and
Archimedes, who were turned to
stone by the whole affair, the
female orifice of the year award
was presented to Tony Dean.
Pat Leggett, inflated by being
named Johnny Of The Year, burst
his trophy. To shouts of "Spam
Spam Spam" the invisible Spam
Preston was proclaimed Tit Of
The Year. The Biggest C o c k - u p
was by Tony Dent.
As well as silly awards Mark
Corrigan announced the winners
of Guilds colours. Mark handed
over his gown to the new Guilds
President, J o Armitage. After the
h a n d o v e r c e r e m o n y w a s
completed teams of the new and
outgoing Execs, performed a
trouserless boat race. Exotic
leisurewear was worn by both
sexes.
Attention turned to the traffic
warden who appeared to be
booking Bo for parking outside
the Memorial. A keen veteran car
enthusiast, his aim was only to
warn Guilds, and instead of
issuing a ticket he wrote down
technical details about the car.
