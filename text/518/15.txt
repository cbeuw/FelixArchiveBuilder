An attempt by Union Preisdent Mary Attenborough to get Council to
refer back the controversial abortion motion passed at last week's
Union meeting fizzled out when she discovered that she would not have
to act on the motion in the near future.
She had been worried that she and IC Union's other representatives
on the University of London Students' Representative Council (SRC)
would have to propose withdrawal from the National Abortion
Campaign at the SRC meeting, 23rd May. But when she heard that the
meeting would not be discussing policy and there would not be another
meeting until the end of June she withdrew her motion to Monday's ICU
Council meeting.
Abortion will again be discussed at the Union meeting next Tuesday
and Ms Attenborough hopes that the decision not to support the NAC
will be amended.
Council met on the lawn in the pleasant surrounds of Silwood. Other
items on the agenda were less controversial.
Members accepted a proposal that ICU should tentatively agree to
host the International Conference of Student of Technology two years
from now. This is a conference, largely sponsored by industry, to which
the Union sent three representatives this year.
A s a result of discussions at that conference Council agreed to set
up a Union Committee to help students find training places and jobs
abroad.
Another body set up by Council is a Union Safety Committee. This
has become a legal requirement and Council also accepted a Union
Safety Policy drawn up by its own resident safety expert Bernard Smith.
Prompted by the Union Permanent Working Party C o u n c i l accepted a
number of suggestions to improve student interest in Union meetings.
Among these are an ICU stall at Frehsers' Fair, a printed guide to Union
meetings and an attempt to ensure that other meetings or classes do not
clash with Union meetings.
A new task given to the P W P is the revision of the Union Policy
Document in an attempt to bring it up to date.
Council Members on the Lawn al Silwood Park
It was agreed that four more Union office-holders should be offered
rooms in hall next year. These are the S C A B Chairman, the Union
Publicity Officer, IC Radio Station Manager and the Overseas Students'
Committee Chairman.
Because of the difficulty of finding a departmental representative for
Management Science where most of the students are postgraduates on
one year courses Council decided to move the election for this post to
the autumn term.
the most controversial item discussed by Council was whether there
should be a barrel of beer at the Joint Council meeting in June. The
decision was to provide one.
Finally Council adjourned to a quiet country pub nearby, took over
the premises and drank their entire stock of Director's bitter.

ART COLLEGE PLEA
The Royal College of Art has
a^ain complained to IC Union
about IC students using their
refectory. They are asking
students not to eat there before
1.00pm or they will be forced to
institute rard checks.
NO GO
Stan has appealed to people not
to remove galsses from his bars in
Southside. Glasses should not be
taken further than the lounge and
refectory areas.
He is trying to cut the heavy
loss of beer glasses and hopes
students will co-operate. IC
Union has given support to his
decision.
EXPLOSIVE OCCASION
The sun shone brightly on IC's
wind orchestra at their annual
open air lunchtime performance
in the shadow of the Queens
lower on Tuesday.
Highlight of the occasion was
Tehaikovski's 1812 symphony
acrompained by explosives
detonated on the lower balcony
and the pealing of the bells.
FIRE STOPS LIFT
A fire in the engine room of the
Union Building lift on Tuesday
has put the lift out of action. No
further damage was caused.
