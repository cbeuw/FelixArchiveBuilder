Q.E.C. 1st XI
The day started badly with
the key m e m b e r s of the I.C.
side stranded in The Orange
Tree in R i c h m o n d whilst the
other half of the team
conducted an in-depth survey
of the R i c h m o n d one-way
system. Somehow by 3pm
there were nine m e m b e r s of
the lst X I at QJEC's ground.
This did not include skipper
Toplis who was stranded in
R i c h m o n d P a r k having erotic
fantasies about deer.

_203 - 6 Dec
33 all out
Olympians 132 all out
IC Sunday XI 75 for 9
Match Drawn
For ihe first time this season
Furnish lost the toss, and
Olympians elected to bat on a soft
green wicket. 30 minutes later, at
14 for 3, the decision looked a
mistake but Olympians pulled
back to 52, when the combined
subtle moves of bringing on
spinner Slator and balding old
man Hallett, who clearly had the
opposition beaten with raw pace,
reduced them to 92 for 7.
They finally made 132 all out.
IC started well with Stantiford
making the bowling look worse
than it was, and the wicket look
better than it was. He went for 21
with the score on 23 (2 byes) and
the wickets began to tumble due
to a combination of good bowling,
bad batting, and a very uneven
bounce. The draw was finally
saved primarily by a patient 17 not
out from Ellacott who was there
for about 25 overs, and was well
supported for 9 overs for the final
wicket by Crowe who, having
been ICs outstanding bowler with
4 for 21, batted for probably the
best 0 not out he will ever get.
Certain IC players appeared to
be holding a prayer meeting in the
pub afterwards but were asked by
the landlord to cease their
mediations.
To give the opposition credit,
Patel batted well.
Team:- Furnish, Tomlinson, Stantiford, Ellacott,
Chadband, Slator, Acford, Hallett, McLellan.

IC 2nd XI
Kings 2nd XI
Improvement at last! This time we actually had the Minibus keys, but
the Minibus seemed to lack an engine. Failing to be discouraged, the
team clambered into a red cattle truck, which was adroitly backed out of
the parking lot by driver Acford, despite gaining an extra coat of yellow
paint on the way.
The bright sunshine obviously affected skipper Furnish, who
proceeded to toss up with the Kings 1st XI captain. When this was
eventually pointed out to him, he shuffled across to the other pitch,
muttering 'we would have beaten them anway' and won thetoss. FirstXI
import Everett and third XI reject Kendrick opened the batting, and put
on 34 before Kendrick was beaten for pace by a medium pacer, and
comprehensively bowled. Cowboy Care, encouraged by his
performance the previous week, played an atrocious shot, and sliced a
half volley to deep mid off. 'Spark Plug' Furnish came in to join Everett
with the score on 44, and with a variety of mishits and edges from
Furnish at one end, and some majestic stroke play from the little man at
the other end, this pair of unlikely lads put on 130 before Everett was
bowled for an amazing 110.
Now was the obvious time to
declare, but with the captain on
for a fifty, this seemed unlikely.
Despite deliberately running out
the luckless 'Taffy' Salter, he was
out for 47. McGuire fell next ball,
so the declaration was delayed to
give the bowler a chance of a hat
trick (and a jug). The padless
Acford loped out to join Ellacott,
who, not knowing the rules ofthe
game, hoiked the next ball over
square leg.
With Kendrick and the still limp
Dean suffering from a surfeit of
sandwiches, IC opened with the
naked pace of Ellacott, and the
more cultured pace of Wyatt.
Kings were soon 5 for 3, thanks to
two fine catches held by Salter
and Furnish. A magnificent
partnership of 16 then developed,
between two b a t s m e n w h o
refused to be intimidated by either
bouncers or sarcasm. Finally
Ellacott pitched a ball on line, and
uprooted leg stump. Wyatt was
r e p l a c e d by A c f o r d , w h o
produced two amazing overs of
viciously straight full tosses. One
unfortunate batsman actually hit
one to our resident spin-bowler,
who dropping his daisy chain,
threw the ball to Acford in true
cowboy style. Acford, rumoured
to have been selected for his
driving abilities, showed a vast
amount of co-ordination and
deflected the ball onto the stumps
for a creditable run-out.
The spin attack having been
thereby roused, was brought on to
bowl, gaining one wicket, and so
frightening the batsmen that
Wyatt was able to mop up the
remaining rabbits next over,
simply by bowling straight. Kings
final total was 33,10of which were
extras, giving a final result of
victory by 170 runs, and enabling
Ellacott to take 4 for 5.
McGuire,
Team:- Furnish (Captj, Everett, Kendrick, Care, Salter
Ellacott, Acford, Wyatt, Vincent, Dean.
IC 2nd XI 86 all out
QEC 2nd XI 31 all out
IC won by 55 runs
Winning the toss on a fine, dry day against a side who already bore the
mark of cowboys, IC elected, not surprisingly, to bat.
Queen Elizabeths attitude of'couldn't care less' on the field seemed to
work its way through to Furnish and Tomlinson who were soon back in
the pavilion to make the score 21 for 2. Wyatt folowed shortly
afterwards, given Ibw to a ball 2 feet wide, to enablethe Queen Elizabeth
umpire to run off the field to the loo. To make amends the opposition
captain then instructed him to give an equally bad decision in our
favour, giving Acford, who made 20, and helped in a partnership with
top scorer Salter (21), not out when he was on 0. IC finally made 86.
After a stern tea time lecture soon as Acford, at the other end,
began to bowl on the stumps, the
wickets fell, and he finished with a
remarkable (I still don't believe it)
7 for 15, including a hatrick. Q E C
were finally all out for 31.
Acford should have bought 4
jugs; 1 for 5 wickets, 1 for a
hatrick, 1 for his first ever
boundary, and 1 for his first ever
score in double figures, but tight-
fistedly he supplied 1 jug only.
from the IC captain on the low
standard of the previous weeks
fielding, and on the undesirability
of being beaten by such ateam, IC
fielded with some vigour.
A fine Tomlinsqn throw ran out
an opener on the 3rd ball of the
innings and the following ball saw
Wyatt have the next batsmen
caught by Stean at leg slip. As
Team: Furnish, Tomlinson, Acford, Wyatt, Mahers, Heath, Clothier,
Salter, Stean, Roche, Graham.
