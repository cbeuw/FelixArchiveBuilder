ALLOM CUP VICTORY
Boat Club Sweeps the Board
O n the afternoon of Wednesday, M a y 9th, the m e n of
Imperial College Boat Club turned up i n strength at the
University o f L o n d o n Boat House at Strand-on-the-Green,
Kew, to take part in the A l l o m C u p regatta for U L Colleges.
Only three colleges stood any real chance of winning i n the
various events m a k i n g up the regatta. Firstly, Imperial
College, with a Henley win behind them, and recent experience
of competing at National level at the A R A ' s Nottingham
meetings. Secondly, U C H , strong i n college rowing, but,
seldom noted elsewhere. Finally, Q M C , who h a d 'persuaded'
several of their m e n rowing i n the U L U squad to turn out for
Q M C on the day.
Conditions were good, a n d were only spoiled by a few
brainless motor launch drivers who caused several near
accidents.
T H E E V E N T S
O P E N S C U L L S - Chris 'Bomber' Howell beat Q M C / U L superstar
' D o n n y ' H i l l , and is continuing his bid to rise from novice to elite in one
year.
C O X L E S S P A I R S - A l a n Cooper and Colin Southall's meteoric and
erratic start so unnerved M r H i l l and his companion that they gave up
within 50 yrds ofthe start. Result- a walkover.
C O X E D F O U R S - Steve Pumphrey's determined crew finally notched
up a win against U C H . M r H i l l didn't enter this one because of his elite
status...
C O X L E S S F O U R S - . . . b u t he was allowed to row in this event. It didn't
do h i m m u c h good, however, as the I C boat, which had been competing
with National Squad crews the previous weekend, took nearly two
lengths o i l ' Q M C over this short course.

Here. I C was the meat in the
sandwich between Q M C and
U C H . U C H was on the water
early, waiting for the other eights,
who were waiting for their
respective coxless boats to return
and double up for the big event.
M r H i l l and a few other friends
from the U L squad were making a
last trv for a pot in a glass-fibre
' C A R B O C R A F T ' eight while IC
were using 'in house' technology,
rowing ' T H E P R I O R Y ' , and the
U C H crew were in a conventional
wooden boat.
W i t h s u r p r i s i n g l y l i t t l e
jockeying at the start, the three
eights were lined up, and the race
started. I C produced a very
average start, a n d had to row
through between Q M C (to
Middlesex) and U C H (to Surrey):
as these were slowly converging
the I C cox had a problem on his
hands.. Tactfully ignoring the U L
umpire, a n d with the aid of
explanatory gestures. I C was able
to pull through unscathed, a n d
had a clear lead by the halfway
mark. T h e crew relaxed into a
steady three-quarter pressure,
and passed the finishing post.
'The Ship' at M o i t l a k e . easy
winners. As Q M C came last M r
H i l l was unable to repeat former
claims of coming second.
IC's only loss was when the
novice eight were narrowly
defeated by U C H 'novices',
winners ofthe I T . head novice
pennant a levy weeks previously.
M r Hill did not go away empty-
handed: Q M C ' won the coxed
pairs event, by default, as no-one
else had such a boat.
As a result of these A l l o m C u p
performances, Chris Howell, a
pair, a n d two lours, will be
representing the University of
London at the British Universities
Championship: they will, of
course, be rowing in Imperial
College colours.
