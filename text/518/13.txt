ICROSS COUNTRY
Batavierenrace Tour
HOLLAND
' T a k i n g part is m o r e important than winning' was the race
motto and the Dutch were certainly into the spirit ofthe event.
The race of 25 stages attracted the capacity n u m b e r of 150
teams a n d Nijmegen University, the hosts, fielded 44 of these.
The organisation, facilities and enthusiasm necessary to stage
such a colossal event involving 3750 runners a n d an entourage
of supporters almost defies the imagination and it is basically
inconceivable that anything similar could be staged i n this
Country.
The seventh Batavierenraee began at midnight on Saturday 28th
A p r i l in the spectacular light of red fireworks on the running track at
. Nijmegen. Then off into the night, through a corner of Germany, across
the Rhine and back into H o l l a n d up to Dinxperlo where we arrived at
about 04.00, ten stages having been completed, with the Impalas in 4th
place out of the 75 teams which h a d started at midnight.
Uncomfortably close behind were Surrey University in 5th. M a r t i n
Tarnowski after overtaking Surrey during leg 6, took a wrong turn and
lost them again. Phil Gibbs in leg 10 reclaimed our position after a great
run by Pete Johnson in leg 9. R o b Allinson running the longest leg
worked wonders for the team as usual, by finishing with the second
fastest time for that leg. only 9 seconds behind the fastest from
Dortmund. Credit to Bryan for pulling up over 40 places during leg 2.
Because the leaders quickly
gain hours on the trailers, the race
contains three restarts, the first
being at Dinxperlo for leg 11. The
runners and their accompanying
cyclists took to the road at 06.03,
just ahead of panic a n d near
disaster as 150 minibuses jostled
for space to head off on the car
route to deposit the leg 12 runner
in time. W e just made it and then
no real trouble throughout the
second stage, finishing 5th at
Barchem for legs 11-18.
Similar pandemonium reigned
at the second restart at 11.00. with
a last minute switch of our
runners for legs 19-24 to the
minibus which was least hemmed
in. Again, there was no real
trouble u p to leg 24 which ended
at Boekelo, a s m a l l town
completely engulfed by 4500 lads
and lasses a n d about 300
minibuses. T h e shops a n d cafes
and Pubs can never have known
such trade. U p to this point, the
restarts h a d been in two halves.
' with the runners of teams 76-150
setting oflan hour after those from
1-75.'
At Boekelo however, for the
start ofthe final leg, 150 of'the best
runners at the event lined up
together at 16.15 behind a roaring
set of motorcycles which were to
clear the way. Motorcyclists,
runners then their bewidlered
bicycle escorts set off in a
spectacular surge, as the rest of
the teams rushed for their
minibuses in an attempt to travel
to the finish before the first

runners arrived. W e made it just
in time to see our M a r t i n
O ' H a l l o r a n coming in in 13th
position after a superb run during
which he was the last to get
through a level crossing before the
gates came down!
O v e r a l l t h e I m p a l a s ,
comprising 13 I C students and 12
from St Mary's College, finished
7th in a time of 10 hours 2 minutes
39 seconds for the 100 mile race,
an improvement of 6 minutes 37
seconds on last year and this time
with the legal number of ladies.
Surrey finished one place and 10
minutes behind, a n d the only
other British team, Royal Vets
College in 74th after getting
disastrously lost at one stage.
Three minutes faster would not
only have broken the ten hour
barrier but also would have
gained us 2 places. U n d e r ten
hours will surely be our aim for
next year. The winners were Delft
Delvers from H o l a n d in 9.31.50,
but Gottingen from Germany
were only robbed of victory
through fielding one runner
twice, which is against the
regulations.
The party afterwards was as
sensational as the race itself and
was held at the Bastille, the 21st
century U n i o n building of
Twente Polytechnic, where the
race finished.
O u r thanks to R C C for the loan
of two very well behaved
minibuses.

Imperial College v London House
The mens team were due to play the annual fixture against
London House last Saturday.
We m e t i n the glorious sunshine o f Princes Gardens
stunned by the thought that we might play a match
uninterrupted by rain or sleet.
O n a r r i v i n g at Harlington, we decided to practice until our
opponents turned up. After playing singles for an hour under
the burning sun, everybody agreed that it was time for a rest.
As we were crawling towards the bar at about three o'clock, our
opponents arrived in two taxis. After introducing themselves they said
they would like to start the match as soon as possible.
O u r first pair, Tony and A d r i a n , got off to a blinding start, losing 6-1,
6-1, to Alastair and A r n a u d . Tony played his usual game but Adrians
play became more feverish as the game progressed. After this setback
A d r i a n retired with some form of plague, to be replaced by Neville.
This resulted in a comfortable win against Londons third pair, G r a h a m
and Clive.
Chris and Dave were IC's best pair of the day, dropping only seven
games to London's 2nd and 3rd pairs before tea.
Barry and Dave halved their first match against Dave and Lalit, but
kept the contest open by losing to A r n a u d and Alastair.
D u r i n g tea, T o n y suggested that next time we skip practice session,
A d r i a n wandered about like a ghost and Chris came to the stunning
conclusion that we were 31/2 - 21/2 up.
The three matches after tea were all drawn. The most worthy of these
was Chris and Dave scoring 3-6, 6-3 against A r n a u d and Alastair who
had previously dropped only lour games.
Final Score:
Imperial College 5 L o n d o n House 4,
Teams:
fC.-
Tony Tsoukkas and Adrian Clarke (Neville Pitt) Chris Yates and Dave
Cornwell. Barry Wills and Dave llitig\.
London:-
