Lobby of Governors
There is to be a lobby of the College Governors outside their
meeting next Friday, calling on college to charge overseas
students the same tuition fees as home students (in line with
Union policy). It is also hoped that a hardship fund will beset up
to help those affected by the increases.
If you are at all concerned about the discrimination against
overseas students in this way then sign the petition in the Union
Office and come to the lobby outside 170 Queens Gate at 10.30
am on May 25th.
Refectories
I was amazed to hear that refectory committee actually voted
on the monthly constant ofthe regulator. If one quarter of a per
cent turns out to be too small then obviously the committee can
vote to change it. I hope that this democratic procedure will
continue, and if it does then there should be little cause for
complaint from the student body.
Of course, what you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the
bar prices. At the moment we are suffering from higher prices
compared with the locals. When the survey reveals this
discrepancy I hope Professor Eilon will carry out his policy of
keeping College prices competitive.

YACHT REPAIRED
Yacht C l u b should soon be able
to use their yacht following the
satisfactory completion of repairs
to the engine.
Problems started last summer
when it was discovered that work
costing £800 was necessary. They
finally convinced C o r a l M a r i n e to
carry out the work under
guarantee and have now received
a satisfactory report from the
surveyors.
PRICES VICTORY
Refectory C o m m i t t e e has
voted for only l ' 4 per cent
monthly wages regulator, turning
down C h a i r m a n Professor Eilon's
recommendation for 1/2 percent
increases.
The wages regulator com-
pensates for increased labour costs
and will take effect in J u l y il the
Rector accepts the Committee's
recommendation. Professor Eilon
is to inform the Rector of his
disagreement with the decision.
The Committee also decided to
up prices by 5 percent in termly
review. T h e increase is likelv to
take elite t on lst July in Southside
but be delayed until October in
the U n i o n .
LIFE MEMBERSHIP OFFER
Existing members of the
Constituent College O l d Student
Associations will be able to
become life members of Imperial
College U n i o n at half price.
The three associations have all
agreed to this 'one ofT oiler but
not to a continuing package life
membership deal.
AP CRITICISED
City and Guilds U n i o n officers
have c r i t i c i s e d I C U n i o n ' s
recently published 'alternative
prospectus' for not devoting
enough space to the Constituent
College Unions.
But Editor Roger Stotesbury
explained that several articles had
to be cut at the last moment
because there were eight pages
more than the target ol 64 pages.
IRANIANS CAN STAY
Iranian students who are
unable to pay their fees because of
continuing difficulties in getting
money out of Iran will not be
forced to leave College, says
College Registrar Peter Mee.
The period over which they can
claim social security has now been
extended indefinitely.
OLD STUDENTS AGAINST
HIGH FEES
S e v e r a l f o r m e r overseas
students at I C are supporting I C
Union's campaign against high
tuition fees and overseas student
quotas.
But a questionnaire sent to
current overseas students has had
a poor response with only 69
replies. O f these however many
are self supporting and have said
that they will face financial
hardship with the increased lees.
The U n i o n is to lobby College
Governors next Friday in protest
against overseas students being
charged higher fees than home
students. They are also calling for
a hardship fund.
Demonstrating Rates
The revised rates for student demonstrators are £2.99 per
hour. A n increase of 49p which is backdated to 1st October
1978.
Sicycle Thefts
On a less cheerful note there have been a lot of thefts of cycles
lately. It is very important that you know the frame number of
your bike and that it is locked with a sturdy lock and chain. The
usual plastic covered cables are no deterrent against the
determined thief.
Simon's Paragraph
Following his usual tactics of blackmail, bribery and assorted
perversions committed against a defencelss FELIX Staff,
exhausted after a solid ten minutes pasting up, and with nothing
better to do than listen to his show, Simon (The Mouth) Milner
has succeeded in his attempt to extract from me a whole
paragraph in my Editorial. I hope the Keogh Mafia get him soon!
Congratulations
To Howard and Ros on their engagement.
Cheers,
John
BAR PRICES TOO HIGH
Bar Committee C h a i r m a n
A n d y Middleton is doing a survey
of local pubs to see how prices
compare with College bats.
College beer prices start at 35p
per pint in the U n i o n and 36p in
Stan's bar compared to a
m a x i m u m starting price of 32p
elsewhere in London University.
Professor Eilon has stated that
it is College policy that bars
should be competitive with local
pubs and if it is proved that they
are not competitive prices would
be cut.

CYCLE OWNERS
To those of y o u w h o bring
cycles to the College, please
make sure y o u use very stout
chains together with equally
strong locks. Far too many plastic
covered steel cables and weak
locks are still being used.
Thefts of cycles from the
College is again on the increase.
To date 24 have been stolen this
year, 5 within the last few days.
M o s t c y c l e s have F r a m e
Numbers and I do ask all owners
to search for this number and
personally record it. Should they
have the misfortune to report the
theft, the frame number does
assist the Police in their enquiries.
Do try a n d get your cycle
insured for theft etc.
