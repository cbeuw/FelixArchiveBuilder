Renaissances 1979 UK tour has inevitably
Included a concert at Hammersmith Odeon.
Before a fairly enthusiastic audience they
performed an excellent range of tracks
sleeted evenly from old to new albums, giving
a show which should have left most
Renaissance fans quite satisfied.
The support act, an Irish husband-and-wife
folk duo called 'Gay and Terry Woods',
ponfused the issue by craftily starting on
time, thus leaving the stage as most people
arrived. Bathed in a solitary amber spotlight
in the empty black expanse of the Odeon,
they sang songs with titles like 'Double
Yellow lines'. They were basically very
pleasant; G a y having a g o o d v o i c e
reminiscent of Annie Haslam's and playing a
strange instrument like a stringed vegetable
marrow, which required elaborate tuning
between songs. Her husband on guitar
seemed unable to control his volume,
h o w e v e r , a n d b l u r t e d e m p h a s i s o n
completely unsuitable words in the middle of
lines.
The audience was fairly uniformily dressed
in tidy jumpers and cords, not a studded
jacket in sight, and showed their restlessness
between acts merely by politely applauding
two roadies and the safety curtain.
Behind me sat a group of Germans, talking
loudly. All I could translate was the following
enigmatic exchange.
7 have seen them before. They have a
piano'.
7, however, prefer Alice Cooper.'
I think the reply was 7 think Mickey Mouse
is better.', but probably my sub^O level
German missed the subtleties of this
exchange.
Renaissance came on after a short interval.
A n n e Haslam, the lead singer, swirled and
bopped, on the spot, hands on hips, and
Renaissance were soon into an enjoyable
mixture of old favourites and recent releases.
'Prologue', 'Mother Russia', 'Song for all
Seasons' and especially 'Northern lights',
were all included and recognised with wild
applause, but Renaissance enthusiasts will
have missed 'Ocean Gipsy' and 'Running

Renaissance live at Hammersmith Odeon, Friday May 11th.
'Scheharazade' was featured, but this was
wise as it sounds best with an orchestra.
Annie seemed apologetic about the new
songs introduced into the act. This hesitance
invited a murmur from the audience.
'Oyl' she said with her famous recurring
laugh, W e V e got to include some new songs
you know'.
As bass guitarist J o n C a m p remarked,
Renaissance songs take inspiration from
diverse sources (Solzhenitsyn, The flood of
Lyons, Scheharazade), but none stranger
than 'Secret Mission'. This J o n warned, was
composed to alleviate the boredom induced
by an American James-Bond type film, but
'Secret Mission' turned out to be very good.
'This is our latest single, just released.
declared Annie, later. A lone voice cheered in
the fifth row.
"Oh, so you're the one who bought it!' she
said, laughing again.
(There was a slight pause as the Germans
explained this witticism to each other, then
laughed incongruously thirty seconds after
everyone else.)
The climax of the performance was the
encore. 'Ashes are Burning', one of
Renaissance's most popular tracks. Annie
Haslam cooed melodically over John Tout's
stacatto piano double octaves, and J o n C a m p
burst into a double necked guitar solo. The
whole track was very exciting and blossomed
into spectacular overkill as plumes of fire and
smoke fireworked upward from the front of
the stage, the audience swept with beams of
light sparkling off the Odeon's obligatory
mirror-globes at the rear. The music got
louder, Annie sang higher, and as glorious
mellotron chords died away, the group
surged down off their various instruments to
shake hands with the delighted front row.

Singles Review:
Leigh Foster
The first exhibit in this case is a record by
the Clash, to wit the new single by them. It is
a cover version of Sonny Curtis T fought the
law'. This is the second cover song they have
released as a single recently, if they don't cool
it soon they'll end up like the Shadows. T h e i r
last attempt, on English C i v i l W a r was much
better, having at least some ofthe venom of
their earlier songs, but this song hangs sadly
empty., (Tris says 'yeahh') Anyway I think if
Joe Strummer is running out of ideas for
songs maybe he should take a vacation.
Exhibit B is a record called ' I ' m H a n g i n g
A r o u n d ' , a n d it is by the Leyton Buzzards. It
is nothing like ' H a n g i n g A r o u n d ' of
Stranglers fame, but stands up on its own as a
really listen-to-able disc. It is an everyday
story of teenage love, told a little more
conventionally than Jilted John. This bloke
fancies a nice girl and is thrilled to be the one
she chooses out from the local lads, but then
she turns nasty on him, but of course his love
is true and I could go on all day but time,
space and sore lingers prevent me.
If you would care to examine the next
exhibit with great care not to get too close, for
fear of contamination. It is a disco version of,
wait for it, no not the song of Solomon, that's
been done. N o this piece of putrescent plastic
attempts to discofy the anthem of the N e w
Wave 'Sex and Drugs and Rock and R o l f
Possibly Ian Dury's Meistcrverk, or possibly
not. T h e facts, M ' l u d , are as follows: the
group of people known as Patrick Duvet and
his Sweet Perversions have put out a record
called ' L e Sex, L e Draques et L c
