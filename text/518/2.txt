IW H A T ' S O N
Following the Union Meeting
held on Tues 8lh May at which a
motion was passed withdrawing
support from the National
Abortion Campaign (NAC). I
have since contacted N A C and
have found that many of the
premises, on which the vote was
taken, were untrue. I would like
therefore, to put forward the facts
concerning N A C and hope that
the motion will IJC re-discussed
with a full appraisal of the facts by
a wider spectrum of students at
IC.
The N A C supports aliortion on
demand. It nowhere states that it
condones 'killing a child within a
few hours of its birth'. Abortion
means 'terminating a pregnancy'
.not killing a child. So if Barry
Austin and his friends can keep a
child in an incubator and allow it
to live, all well & good, I've no
objections. What N A C and the
W o m e n s M o v e m e n t a r e
interested in is the woman's right
to choose what becomes of her
body: that it should be her
decision to have a child, not a
doctors or the state or the church.
Only when women have this right
will they be able to take an equal
part in this society.
The present law on abortion
(1967) requires the concent of two
doctors who feel that con-
tinuation of pregnancy would
endanger the health - physical or
mental of the woman; injure the
lives of her children that are
already alive or if there is any
substantial risk that the child
could be severely handicapped.
N A C is certainly opposed to
profiteering by abortions. A l l
legal institutions performing
abortions do so only under
scrutiny of the NHS. BP AS and
P A S are both registered
chairitics, ie non-profit-making,
charging /75-80 for an early
abortion, £130 for a later one.
This sum is considerably less than
for a full term baby. N A C (unlike
L I F E and SPUC) campaign for
research into pregnancy testing,
contraception and safe methods of
abortion.
The main argument at the
meeting was 'late' abortions (after
16 weeks). In 1974 0.8% of all
aliortions in England and Wales
were performed after 20 weeks,
the majority lor medical reasons.
Another point was that of Day-
Care abortions. There are at
present 12 Day-Care units run by
N H S in Britain. This type of
abortion enables women to have
their terminations at an early
stage of pregnancy (up to 12
weeks) with the minimum of
delay or imposition of a heavy
strain on either nursing stall or
N H S financial resources (^35 as
compared to £112 for overnight -
costed in 1977 in Tower
Hamelts). The woman stays in the
hospital clinic for about 4-5 hours.
She is not allowed to leave the
hospital alone and is advised to
have a friend or relative to stay
the night in case of complications.
In a 2 year trial monitored by
D H S S (ended June 1978) B P A S
and P A S (London) carried out
more than 10,000 day-care
a b o r t i o n s w i t h o u t m i s h a p .
Councelling a n d assement is
given beforehand.
I hope this has clarified the
situation a n d I hope further
discussion on the topic will
concern itself with facts and not,
as happened at the meeting, with
uninformed biassed opinions. T h e
fundamental difference between
N A C a n d its oppenents is that
N A C a l l o w s p e o p l e t h e
opportunity to have their o w n
belief without imposing them on
others.
In conclusion we know that
Christians a n d Barry Austin
believe life is sacred, but isn't the
quality of life important too?

Dear Sir, - As two occasional
readers of F E L I X , we find it
surprising that the Editor has now
stooped so low as to devote two
complete columns to the petty
self-indulgent ramblings of M r
Barry Austin.
W e can fully undestand now
after reading such self-centred
childish rantings in your columns,
the reactions of students of other
L o n d o n Colleges on hearing the
name Imperial College. It is now
obvious that the high academic
standing is not matched by the
maturity of its students.
W e can only hope that, like us,
M r Austin is a third year student,
so that future students will not be
treated to such depressing rubbish
again.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir, - It is nice to know that
I C students enjoy fresh air and
sunshine but shameful that such
apparently intelligent people are
so selfish and inconsiderate as to
leave their litter for all in Beit
Q u a d to bear with every time we
have good weather. I'm sure that
all the people who carry their
meals and drink out into the quad
are capable of carrying their
empties to an appropriate rubbish
bin.

Dear Sir, - I feel that I must write
aboout the last I C U G M , held on
Tuesday M a y 8th. T h e first
motion, proposed by M r B
Austin, was totally negative
showing no positive alternative to
the withdrawal from N A C , a n d
then as if this wasn't bad enough
the first amendment was even
more negative, withdrawing all

M O T I O N O N ABORTION
HANDOVER C E R E M O N Y
Union policy on abortion. As with
all the anti-abortion letters to
F E L I X it was interesting to note
that all the speakers in favour of
the m o t i o n a n d t h e first
amendment were male. Very
surprisingly, this motion as
amended was passed in favour of a
second amendment, by M s K
Pratt, which was the only one
which proposed anything like a
positive alternative. Then, alter
the vote was taken, a large section
of the minute percentage of the
College present decided to leave
after their 'pet' subject had been
raised, not even bothering lo hear
the second motion.
Yours,
