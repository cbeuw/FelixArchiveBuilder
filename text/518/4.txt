MEET CORINNE LAZARUS:
IF's BUSINESS OFFICER
H i everyone!
I'm Corinne (fly me!) and I've
been elected (well, actually the
only m u g standing for it -
although I'm sitting down) as
Business Officer. W h i c h means
having the opportunity of giving
my contemporaries spots if they
succumb to the weakness of the
flesh (- in other words, providing
the nosh), and of clothing the
needy (you have to be needy if you
wear the IF gear all the time!)
N o w the i n t e r e s i n g part
(Corinne Lazarus, this is your
.life!).
Aged nearly 20 and still feeling
and acting like 12, I have 1
brother, 1 sister, and 21 goldfish
(don't forget the goldfish!). I was
born Jewish (so avoid pigs like the
plague!), but I have an open mind
towards any religion which seems
to know what it is talking about.
I a m m a d on dancing, and I
love singing (sounds like a right
nut so far!). I also love cooking,
but my mother never lets me into
the kitchen! I love comedies of all
kinds, particularly the funny
ones(!), and weepies - the local
lifeboats are notified in time for
the flood.
I hate punk, j u n k food and all
forms of creepy crawlies (met
quite a few in my time, I might
add!).
I grace St Michael's presence
every Saturday, trying to avoid
working as much as possible!
(Well, I can't be the first to put the
marks into Spencers!).
I live in Ilford, a non-descript
town whose H i g h Street was
supposed to be developing into
the next best West E n d - what
became of it, no one is sure!
M y ambitions are: to grow
another 4 inches (I'm 5 ft 2 ins on
a good day!), to be able to own a
furry animal without sneezing all
over the place, and to live in a
igloo.
M y immediate future (ie when
I have left IF) will probably be
taken up by doing all the crazy
things I have wanted to do but
never had the time, money, or
amount of stupidity needed.
I don't bite, so when you see me
walking down the street (walk on
by) don't hesitate to ask for my
autograph.
Take care now, loads of love
from Corinne.

The IC Annual Rag Fete is
well and truly over now. T h i s
event was a success only
m a r r e d by the bank holiday -
though it was a toss-up
between the Silwood Ball and
F.A. C u p weekend. T h e final
totals f r o m the fete should be
known in the next week and
released as soon as possible.
There are several thankyous to
be made negarding the Fete. The
first being to Raehael Snee for
some good bunting, IC R a d i o for
providing an excellent service on
the day, the college carpenters
and electricians, the people who
helped on the day, etc. In fact
thanks to everyone who put a stall
in and to those who came along
and spent some money, also to
those who helped with the Bar-b-
que.
Within the next three weeks the
final R a g total of the year will be
made known.

M a n is God's creation. The Christian understanding of m a n
must begin here. According to Christianity, m a n is not just a
collection of chemicals that came into being by an intricate
process and then evolved m i n d and consciousness. M a n owes
his whole being, his physical vitality and his spiritual
aspirations, to G o d f r o m w h o m all life derives. H i s existence is
no chance or accident.
The early chapters of Genesis describe creation in evocative pictorial
language, more akin to poetry than science. The whole natural order,
the primaeval energy, the earth, the sea, the plants, the animals, and
filially m a n himself, are declared to be the work of G o d , and good. G o d
is described as forming man from dust and breathing into h i m , giving
him life. T h a t is to say, it is G o d who has designed man to be what he is:
thinker, artist, scientist, builder; above all, worshipper. M a n ' s
enormous creative capacity comes from the Creator. The most creative
act of all is a response to him.
The Christian doctrine ofcreation isn't concerned with the biological
details of man's origin. That is the proper field of study for the zoologist
and anthropologist. But Christianity does assert that by whatever
means man has come into being, it is the work of G o d . The theory of
UNIVERSITY OF LONDON UNION
U L U exists believe it or not (in Malet St - halfway between Goodge St.
and Russell Sq tube stations). It is a large building containing facilities
for Sports, Societies and various other things. It s bar is not too bad (if
you like Stella).
But U L U is T H R E A T E N E D . The students in the largest university
in Europe are not using facilities provided for them. While appreciating
the facilities at IC, many students live away from College in North
London or Intercollegiate Halls and are closer to U L U . So, think,
people and A C T .
Also U L U is the place where we at IC can meet students in non-
scientific disciplines from other colleges. They are in the same
university as ourselves, they are also fellow students they might even
like to meet scientists from IC.
U L U is in danger of closing. Due to the shortage of buildings in
central L o n d o n and the lack of use of the U L U building there is a
distinct possibility of the Senate of the University requisitioning the
building for University purposes and this is not just a threat, they will
do it.
If you would like to find out more about U L U , there will be an open
meeting of the External Affairs Committee at which Jeremy Hyde,
President of U L U will speak on the future of U L U . The meeting is in
the Green Committee R o o m at 7 p m on T h u r s d a y 17th May.
Failing that, see M a r y . Barry Austin, Chris Webb or myself through the
U n i o n Office.

evolution is at present generally considered to be the best description of
the development of living things that science can give, though like all
scientific theories, it is open to criticism and will need modification as
new evidence comes to light. But at best it is only a description ofthe
process. The belief of Christians is that, whatever the process, the
author is G o d .
