Seven IC shooters attended the U L championships at Twickenham on
Saturday 12 May. The weather was rather too hot for comfort, with
mirage and heat haze making long range visibility very bad. The wind
was highly variable but generally light. The course of fire for rifles was
20 shots at each of 25, 50 and I00 yards.
The tie for Ist place was broken by a further 20 shots ai iOO yards.

Chess C l u b
This year's chess club championship was won convincingly by Phil
Maguire with five and a half out of six, a full point ahead of Shayin
Rouhani and Bob Coles who tied for second place. The tournament was
distinguished by some pretty atrocious play with several people
competing for their first IGP (International Grand-Patzer) norm. After
stiff competition from Jitesh Gajjar, who contrived to lose to Maguire in
nine moves, this dubious honour went to Pete Anderson for consistently
bad play throughout the event.
More respectable chess was produced by the two teams in the
Middlesex league. After two fine 6-0 wins at the end of the season the
second team are certain of promotion from the 4th division and may win
it. Many fine individual performances included 4/4 from Jitesh Gajjar on
board I and 7/8 from Steve Madden on Board 3. The final position of the
first team is still in doubt but it looks likely that it will be promoted to the
Premier Division.
Finally, in the 3rd Middlesex team tournament, held at ICU over
May Bank Holiday, the IC team put in a fine performance with 13/24
which included a superb win over pre-tournament favourites Kings
Head. In this 3rd round match British Champion(l) Jonathan Speelman
could make no progress against accurate defence by Maguire and a
draw was agreed. O n board two J o n Freeman lost narrowly to
International player David G o o d m a n whilst Pete Anderson and Chris
Callow both scored brilliant wins against their opponent, Whiteley and
Hillyard who again are players of national calibre.
A fine finish to a very successful season. Steve Madden

IC Vths in late late title bid
At the start the omens looked bad for the fifths when their
captain AI Cable failed in an early attempt to score before the
game started (ie offering two young girls a lift on the way to the
ground ' R o o m for two m o r e inside girls', but being refused).
W h e n the match actually started the Vths quickly took a deserved
lead when a hopeful lob by M a r k Clegg found D a m i a n K e l l y clear in
front of goal and he gave the keeper no chance with a well placed shot.
The fifths followed up this early success with another goal, from a
corner. First Phil L a k i n won the ball in the air and directed it to Paddy
O ' K e l l y who headed the ball across goal for C l i v e Whiteside to head
(Yes, it definitely was Clive Whiteside).
The play, however, was not all
confined to one end. C h a r i n g
Cross had already twice been very
close to scoring when they hit
Steve Veat's near post with first a
thundering free-kick and then a
wickedly flighted shot. A n d it
came as no surprise that Steve wag
eventually beaten when a skilful
C h a r i n g Cross winger burst into
the penalty area and tucked a
neat shot just inside Steve's near
post.
This served to spur the fifths to
greater efforts and after several
shots had been well saved they
went further ahead from another
corner. This was taken by Brian
Edmundson on the right, and
flicked back by James Rowley to
A l Cable who made no mistake
with this opportunity to score.
The fifths now started to take a
strong grip on the game and due
to some excellent m i d field work
were unlucky not to have added
further to their lead before half-
time. A further goal did occur
midway through the second half
when M o M i s r a , in true K e n n y
Dalglish style, darted in between
the full-back and goalkeeper to
score a superb opportunist goal.
F r o m this point I C were in
complete control of the game but
with three minutes left the
substitution of J o h n Healy for M o
M i s r a served only as a spur to
C h a r i n g Cross. A n d with the last
kick of the game (so to speak)
C h a r i n g Cross scored with a fine
near post header, which gave
Steve Veats no chance.
This must go down as an
emphatic team victory in which it
would be difficult to single out
p a r t i c u l a r players i n a
performance to which all the
players contributed greatly; but
Dennis Cook and Steve Veats
must receive special credit.
Dennis for allowing the player he
was marking to socre both goals
because 'He was such a pleasant
bloke', and Steve for believing his
'Dracula' tag by not only
catching but holding every cross
he went for.
Team:- Steve Veats, Brian
Edmundson, Dennis Cook, Phil Lakin,
Al Cable, Damian Kelly, Clive
Whiteside, Mark Clegg, James
Rowley, Mo Misra, Paddy O'Kelly.
