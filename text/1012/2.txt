Computing's 24 Hour Crusader
BY MICHAEL L U D L A M
A student is challenging his
department in an attempt to
obtain round the clock comp-
uting access. Manor Askenazi, a
fourth year computing student is
circulating a petition in favour of
24-hour terminal access for 3rd
and 4th year undergraduates. Mr
Askenazi has already collected a
hundred signatories for his
petition and has received the
support of Departmental Rep-
resentative Caroline Demian.
However, Professor Tom
Maibaum, Head of the
Department of Computing, has
objected to Askenazi's suggestion
on security grounds.
Speaking to F E L I X , Prof-
essor Maibaum described the
proposed unsupervised access to
computing labs as a 'very serious
security risk'.
He also questioned the
wisdom of allowing students to
work all hours of the day and
night in front of a terminal. "It is
not a good form in which to
study, nor is it good for their
health."
In reply, M r Askenazi
retorted, "If we have not learned
to avoid self-destructive behav-
iour by now, College will not be
the one to teach us."
Addressing the security
issue, Mr Askenazi pointed out
that two sets of swipe-card doors
restricted access to the
computing facilities, in addition
to the steel cabling which
immobilises all of the computing
equipment.
Currently, 24-hour access to
computing terminals is not
available to any Imperial
undergraduate. However, in
many more 'enlightened'
universities some form of round
the clock access have been
established for some time.
Certain students have been
granted 'out of hours' access to
complete project work or in
other unusual circumstances, but
Mr Askenazi complains that
such exceptions to the rules are
'inconsistent and unreliable'.
Security Walk Gives Cause For Hope
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Imperial College Security Staff
have been raising money for a
charity walk.
The 'Cause For Hope'
Appeal is raising funds to set up
a centre for lung cancer research
in Liverpool. It is to be a
memorial to the popular T V
entertainer Roy Castle, who died
in September after a long battle
against lung cancer.
The four-week 'Walk of
Hope' by two security officers, at
the University of Liverpool,
which started in Edinburgh is
due to arrive at College today.
The officers, Ray Pullen and
John Collins, requested the
support of their colleagues in 22
other universities to achieve
their target of £12,000.
Graham Inniss, Imperial's
security coordinator, said: "This
is a cause we hope people will dig
into their pockets and support...
our target was £500 but we hope
to raise nearer £1000. We're very
much indebted to the RAG office
[for their help], and we're proud
of our staff for their work."
Speaking to F E L I X , Ian
Robertson, Rag Chair, said that
there would be collection
buckets around College, at the
Rag bash in the evening, and also
at the Pub Crawl.
The walkers will be going to
College via Knightsbridge,
accompanied by Rag collectors,
and presentation of the proceeds
is to take place in the Solar
Room at 170 Queen's Gate on
Monday morning.
Liz Carr of the Press Office,
who has been publicising the
event, said: "Security have been
wonderful, and Rag have been
very good as well... it's
something that's touched a lot of
people, and has become a pop-
ular cause to support."
The walkers are due to leave
Imperial College on Monday for
the London School of Eco-
nomics. They will complete their
600-mile trek at City University
on Tuesday.
Chemistry To Lose Lecture Theatres
BY ANDREW SMITH
Imperial College's Department
of Chemistry, arguably the
country's leading chemistry
department, will be without
dedicated lecture theatres if the
new Basic Medical Sciences
(BMS) building goes ahead.
F E L I X has learnt that their
present facilities are due to be
demolished in July of next year,
with no funding available for
replacements.
Dr Brian Levitt, Chem-
istry's Director of Undergraduate
Studies, has told F E L I X that he
has 'no idea what the solution
would be' to the lack of lecture
theatres. He confirmed that
although original plans had
forseen three new lecture
theatres over the present Lyon
Playfair Library, funding
pressures has forced the shelving
of two of these.
Dr Levitt stressed the
difficult situation that Chemistry
is in, having already publicised a
new four year course, it is now
finding itself without theatres.
Questions have been raised as to
whether this will put off future
students from applying for the
course.
Mr Ian Caldwell, Director of
Estates, has confirmed that the
Higher Education Funding
Council of England (HEFCE),
will not fund the building of new
theatres at Imperial when others
remain empty for significant
periods of time. Mr Caldwell
attempted to calm fears, saying
that studies were in progress as
to the usage of all the College's
lecture theatres.
He confirmed that central
coordination of theatres is being
considered, with Chemistry and
Biochemistry students possibly
having to be lectured in other
departments.
One option under consid-
eration is the insertion of raked
seats into the Union Concert
Hall to be available both for
lectures during the day and the
cinema in the evening.
Dr Levitt has said that his
department is 'making represe-
ntations at all levels' to resolve
the situation. He sarcastically
commented that, "all this is a
brilliant example of planning".
With the proposed move of
almost a thousand students to
the BMS building, the extent of
provision for their accom-
modation and recreational
facilities is not known. Mr
Caldwell has said that he hopes
the development of additional
accommodation will procede in
parallel to the development of
teaching facilities.
Options being discussed are
the building of residences over
both the Sports Centre and the
tennis courts beside Linstead.
Also on the cards is the ren-
ovation of the parts of Beit Quad
which will be vacated by the
Biology Department.
