However, their oppositions defence remained
steady, if at times frantic, allowing the
Islamic society to win 1-0 and pocket the
booty of thirty pounds.
Congratulations to all the teams that

is something to do
with an Australian
women's jail, you've
been watching the
wrong TV show. The
Prisoner is a British
TV series which stars J
Patrick McGoohan as
an ex-spy, and follows
his time spent in the m
eerie 'Village', where
everyone has a number
instead of a name.
Most episodes involve
Number Two trying to
find out why Number
Six (McGoohan) 1
resigned form his job.
Number Six mean-
while spends his time I
trying to escape. I
Plenty of action tinged I
with paranoia and lots B
more long words I ff
can't think of.
The evening's -
events will start at 7.00pm with a showing of
a great episode of The Prisoner, 'The
Schizoid Man'. Dave has an interesting talk
and film show planned for afterwards; he will
be speculating about the new film, showing
rare footage of The
Making of The
Prisoner, and other
snippets of Prisoner
related material. If
there's anything you
wanted to know
about this tv show
("So what is it all
about anyway? I
thought I under-
stood it until the last
episode...") now is
the time to ask.
Entrance is free to all.

ested, ICSF's

Who: Film Soc
What: Sharon & Kevin Arrive
Keys: Breath, Sinner, Wyatt
At Filmsoc we like to listen to public opin-
ion, so when we hear that Sharon Stone and
Kevin Costner have been voted the sexiest
leads in Hollywood, we bring them to you.
Sharon appears alongside Richard Gere at an
Intersection on Saturday 19th at 8pm. In this
film however she actually gives a good perfor-
mance rather than just stripping for the cam-
era. Our Richard faces a choice between his
mistress or Sharon, as far as most of us are
concerned, there really isn't a choice to make.
Sunday's film has a 7.30pm start due to
the epic length of Wyatt Earp. Kevin Costner
has said that short films are just trying to put
bums on seats but when you witness this,
you'll be on the edge of yours instead. The
story actually gives a true account of the OK
Coral, not to mention the rest of Wyatt's
eventful life. Dennis Quaid gives a stirring
performance as Doc Holiday that is not to be
missed.
On Thursday, in The Color of Night at
8pm, Bruce Willis gets to tackle Jane March
with some very steamy scenes. The 'Sinner
from Pinner' gives a memorable performance
in the swimming pool but how on Earth
Bruce and Jane manage to hold their breath
for so long, will have to be seen to believed.
