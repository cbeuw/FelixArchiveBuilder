When was the last time you
stopped to look at the city's face?
Really looked, I mean, not just a
hurried, nervous glance around as
you rush for the tube or bus.
London is a concrete menagerie
that invites you to gasp at its
gaudy and glorious inhabitants
and wallow in its huge and
teeming vibrancy. The streets may
taste of tailbacks and tedium but
thrills could be around the very
next corner, and there's always
something more to do,
somewhere else to be...
Most of the time though
things happen too fast. It's only
late at night, when the city's
fevered breath steadies and slows
- a giant on the edge of fretful
sleep - that we have time to see
things clearly. Everyday objects
assume a moon-drenched grace
and beauty, a density impossible
in the grey light of day.
Take the humble London bus:
even during the day, it's by far the
most interesting way to travel. The
people seem less tense than on
the tube, more inclined to talk
instead of bury their heads in the
paper, and of course you get a
much better view. But at night the
buses come into their own,
transformed by midnight magic
into mobile mad-houses: fertile
breeding grounds for the bad, the
sad and the merely dangerous to
sit next to. And in the lees of the
night, all roads lead to Trafalgar.
Bands of blissed-out clubbers
and bored tourists up way past
their bed-time roam the Square,
all trying with increasing
desperation to find the right stop
for their night-bus, all of them
seemingly intent on getting in your
way. When you finally fight past
them it's usually just in time to see
your bus receding into the
distance. Never mind, there'll be
another one along in an hour...
Besides, there's so much to
do while you wait: you can talk to
the drunks and ignore the
beggars; imagine striking up a
conversation with the beautiful
woman standing next to you (is
she waiting for the same bus as
you?); or just breath in the night
air under the watchful stare of old
Nelson, your thoughts coiling in
upon themselves. Then, some time
later (minutes? hours? It's difficult
to tell) the bus - your bus - pulls
majestically into the square, and
no chariot of the gods could be
more welcome. You pay the fare,
find a seat, and make yourself
comfortable. Ready to begin your
long day's journey into night. Q
another last waltz; posthumous and live
I didn't want to eulogise. But, after
listening to the posthumous album
from Nirvana, Unplugged in new
york, I'm afraid that it's impossible
not to. This is Nirvana as you've
never heard them before (and sadly
will never hear them again) - their
rawness, their passion and most
tellingly of all, the sheer beauty of
Kurt Cobain's songs all augmented
by the acoustic format.
'About a girl', 'Come as you
are', 'All apologies', 'Dumb', 'Polly',
all are gentle yet probing, soft yet
incisive. We are treated to an
impromptu solo rendition of
'Pennyroyal tea' from Cobain and I
defy it not to send shivers up your
spine.
But this album serves also to
irrefutably prove the magnificence
of Nirvana as performers. Witness
the cover versions; the Vaselines'
'Jesus don't want me for a
sunbeam' (complete with Krist
Novoselic on accordion), Bowie's
'The man who sold the world', a
trio of 1983 Meat Puppet jewels,
and ending with Leadbelly's 'Where
did you sleep last night?'. Listen to
them, close your eyes, and let their
haunting qualities help you to
realise what that old cliche 'making
a song your own' really means.
It's ironic that eMpty TV, the
corporate behemoth that controls
the musical tastes of America,
should serve us with Nirvana's
farewell, especially when the song
that broke them, 'Smells like teen
spirit', was directed straight at the
eMpty TV generation. But then it
probably says more about Kurt
Cobain's punk ethics that he should
choose to use such an estab-
lishment to show the public what his
songs were really worth and to hint
at the direction he was heading for,
if only the inevitable had not
happened. Yes, a corporate whore
who had the last laugh...(9)
The Black Crowes may have
resorted to cheap and tacky
promotional stunts with the sleeve
for their new album, Amorica, but
thankfully there's no sign of any
deterioration on the musical front.
Yes, the Crowes are still inhabiting
some drug-inhabited world circa
late '60s, early '70s but they've
spread their creative wings to pull in
the Grateful Dead, War and the
Flying Burrito Brothers alongside
the standard Stones and Faces
signposts.
And what does that mean?
Well, one word that sums the whole
affair up is groove! Percussion is the
name of the game from the ultra-
rhythmic opener 'Gone' right
through to the use of congas,
Hammond organ and a Spanish
guiro on 'High head blues'.
Elsewhere, there's the wonderfully
funky 'P.25 London' and moody,
country-flavoured, deceptively
addictive melodies like 'Wiser time'.
Okay, so you don't get any
jump-out hit singles like 'Remedy'
but if you take the time to listen to it
as a whole you get a flowing album
full of great songs. Sounds like a
fair deal to me. Maybe Amorica
isn't such a bad place to live after
all (8).
Being a dedicated hack, the
new Ned's Atomic Dustbin album,
522, was blasting out of my stereo
when a friend walked in. "Why are
you playing student music?" he
inquired. Ned's Atomic Dustbin fit
right into this stereotype, despite
the originality of their rhythm
section. This album is however
pretty varied with the majority of
the 22 tracks being old school indie
as favoured by the Wonder Stuff
and Mega City Four. Five are more
experimental, like 'NAD v. NDX =
Intact', and more in the lines of
early Jesus Jones or even industrial.
But then you'd expect a bit of
variation from an album released
as a 'b-sides,odds and sods
compilation' and called 522 because
the tour dates are from 5th to 22nd
November! It is only available on
cd, but retails at a low price, you've
guessed it, £5.22. Would I recom-
mend you to buy it? Can you be a
student without it? (8)
Any album with "The best of..."
in the title normally worries me, but
Fields of gold: the best of Sting is an
exception to the rule. 'It's probably
me', with Eric Clapton, is far better
than the version on "Ten
summoner's tales" and it's appa-
rently from Lethal Weapon 3,
although I failed to spot it when I
saw the film. Another film song,
'Demolition man - soulpower edit',
is irritating at first, but after hearing
it a few times you grow to like it.
For me the combination of the
classic songs, film songs, new songs
and alternate versions of 'Nothing
bout me' and 'We'll be together'
make this album very different from
the usual best of efforts. It's also
very long, at 1 7 tracks and 76
minutes, so if you like Sting in
smaller doses, it'll take you a while
to get through it all. However, this
does mean it's good value for
money, so for this and the yellow
cd, it gets a (9). ©
