Petty crime is increasingly becoming a feature of life at Imperial College,
writes Rachel Walters. Reported thefts in the past week have included two
cassete-radios from cars in the Royal School of Mines car park and four
wallets. Linstead and Weeks halls of residence have had games machines and
a pool table broken into, and damage was done to the chocolate machine in the
Union building, pictured above.

Rag Mag Slagged
BY RACHEL WALTERS
A frenzy has broken out after the
publication of this year's Rag
Mag. The magazine, whose
proceeds will be donated to Rag's
charities, features pictures of
mutilated and pierced male
genitals. Titled 'Doing it for the
kids', the front cover shows a
picture of the Moor's Murderers
collecting for the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. Commenting on the
magazine, Ian Robertson, Rag
Chair, said: "Personally, I feel
very offended by it."
It is rumoured that a motion
to ban the magazine will be
raised at today's Union General
Meeting (UGM). However, as
FELIX went to press, no motion
had been presented to the UGM
Chair. If presented, the motion
would be too late to be added
automatically to the agenda. But
Lucy Chothia, acting U G M
Chair in the absence of Karl
Drage, said it would be up to the
U G M to decide if it could be
presented. Ms Chothia said that
she would not let a technicality
bar any motion.
Friday night entrance fees
will also be reviewed at the
UGM. Currently, access to the
Union building on Friday nights
costs £1, even if only for the use
of the bar. Whilst acknowledging
that students should pay
entrance fees to attend specially
organised events, the motion
demands that access to the
quadrangle and bars be free.
Dan Look, Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
said that he could understand
students' misgivings about the
current policy, but felt that the
alternatives were largely
impractical. He suggested that
students could avoid the
entrance charge by arriving
before 9pm, when admission to
the Union is free.
In previous years, there has
been no charge for access to the
smaller Union bar, but stewards
have said that keeping the two
areas separate has caused great
difficulties. In addition, if the
charge was simply for access to
the Ents Lounge, then the Bar
would have to close at 11pm. It
could not support a bar
extension.
Responding to the motion,
Sam Michel, Imperial College
Union Events manager,
considered the practical
difficulties of trying to charge
students at the entrance to the
events lounge: "This would
definitely create a substantial
bottleneck." He added that it
would, "pose security problems
both in terms of money being
collected and for the stewarding
of doors." Mr Michel felt that the
resulting financial losses would
have to be paid for indirectly by
students. He also noted that the
capacity of the Union building
on a typical Friday night is 550
people, including those in the
whole quad. A paying event
would provide a far easier means
of restricting access.
In a separate UGM motion,
ICU sabbaticals may be
mandated to participate in Rag's
Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump. The event
involves jumping from a minibus
outside Harrods wearing only a
bow tie and then getting back to
College. The response has been
hostile. If the motion is passed,
Lucy Chothia, ICU President,
has already stated that she will
ignore the decision. She stressed
that being naked in public was
illegal and that a UGM's
decision does not take
precedence over civil law. When
asked why she had done nothing
to stop the 'illegal' event, Ms
Chothia refused to comment.
