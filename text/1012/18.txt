Another week, another fleshy appendage of pop-culture
under the scalpel. Stylus furrows his highbrows and delves
into the world of essential books: first up is Naked Lunch.
In the start of another new series, KC gently samples tea and
spies in the Orangery, Kensington Gardens.
Dave T takes the cds and tintin takes the vinyl in the
misbalanced singles review that is rotation.
After a long gap, the london column regraces our pages
with delicate prose about the great jungle. This week Joe
takes a nightbus to past midnight...
Vik relives Nirvana unplugged and flies with the new Black
Crowes' album 'amorica', whilst He/en-Louise says yes to
Ned's Atomic Dushbin and Mark catches the best of Sting.
Better late than a room full of small blue dwarfs, Patrick
Wood finally gets his review of the Whistler exhibtion at the
Tate into our hallowed pages.
tintin looses his head to Three Colours Red, Patrick Wood
goes without dinner to see Final Combination and Magpie
has film festival fun in the company of the Playmaker. .

'A book of great beauty, great
difficulty and maniacally exquisite
insight,' wrote Norman Mailer.
'True genius and first mytho-
grapher of the mid-twentieth
century, William Burroughs is the
lineal successor to James Joyce,'
insisted the beautiful and difficult
J.G. Ballard (with exquisite
insight). And 'more then a perv-pic
about cockroaches!' screams
Stylus, the last mythographer of
the twentieth century (and neither
beautiful nor a maniac but
touched by this book).
This new column is, I'm told,
aimed at pulling great works from
any decade (or century) off the
shelves and onto an indispensable
student bookshelf. This post-
modern approach to literature,
which in the sixties (where Naked
Lunch by William Burroughs
[Paladin, 4.99) first bloomed)
choked with the 'year zero' punk
ethic and thus shot holes in the
cannon, is ideally suited here.
Naked Lunch was constructed with
a 'writing as chunks approach'
using scissors and cow-gum. The
result is a non-linear narrative that
pops and oozes in many directions
rather than carving a single
stream. (All books do this to an
extent and, come the digital
hypertextual age, all will wholly...)
It is unessential and useless to
go into the threads of the 'plot' -
this book attempts to be large and
various: and what is the 'plot' of
America, drug usage, violent sex
and medicine? It shotguns with
slow rubber dum-dums at all these
in incandescent prose unlike
anything before and little since.
Example: "Stay away from the
Queen's Plaza, son... Evil spot
haunted by dicks scream for dope
fiend lover... Too many levels...
Heat flares out from the broom
closet high on ammonia... like
burning lions... fall on poor old
lush worker scare her veins right
down to the bone... Her skin-pop
a week or so do that five-twenty-
nine kick handed out free and
gratis by NYC to jostling
junkies...So Fag, Beagle, Irish,
Sailor beware... Look down, look
down along that line before you
travail there..."
Burroughs, the son of a very
wealthy industrialist, found a
different way of living and a new
way of documenting it. Although
his lifestyle may seem dubious, the
text should never have found itself
banned everywhere except Paris.
In turn, you should accept not the
garish modern-friendly movie but
the truly subversive novel. 0
Feeling peckish for a daintier tea
than sausage rolls in the JCR? Try
the O r a n g e r y in Kensington
Gardens. It's just beyond
Kensington Palace from this side of
the park, at the head of a gravel
walk trimmed with hollies. What
used to be the citrus fruit
conservatory is now a tea-room of
ironwork tables and chairs at
distances just sufficient to
eavesdrop in a genteel sort of way.
And there's a glorious spread of
scones and cakes facing the
entrance.
It's not as Women's Institute-y
as it sounds. The ceiling's as high
as that of a church, and the glass
trickles condensation at this time of
year. The clientele's sometimes
elegant, sometimes dubious. We
were pretty sure the couple at the
next table were Ian McEwan and
his agent. I
f I were MI5, I wouldn't
linger on park benches I'd sit here.
(This could be why I'm not in MI5.)
We had Lapsang Souchong
and Ceylon from their range of
teas (£1.50+) and investigated the
orange and lavender crunch cake
(£1.35) for its alluring description.
It came with a thick frosted topping
of sugar, but little sign of lavender.
Possibly those JCR sausages have
ruined my sensitivity.
Service is polite irrespective of
appearance, but if you sit at the far
end towards the evening (they shut
at 5pm) you risk abandonment. It's
a good place to linger and check
out the rather spooky secret garden
as you leave. 0
