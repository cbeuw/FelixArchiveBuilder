ICvs Everyone Else
Ski racing is all about speed and
danger: like being thrown down
the A12 in a stolen Astra at great
speed with Charlie Woodbridge
[who? -Ed] and a few tinnies at
the wheel.
The first team beat almost
everyone and got 2nd place. The
second had a Top 10 hit, and so
it was a thoroughly successful
evening. We received some
cheap plonk as prizes, and
proceeded to consume all of it on
the way home [I hope that didn't
include the driver! -Ed].
Fred Westberg and Nick
Hubscher did exceptionally well,
Paul Shore and Dorje Brody did
OK. Rod Herries, Charlie, Dan
Figueras, Aoi Takemura and
John Bengston put in impressive
performances, whilst Phil
Barnyard may yet need some
more training!

IC Ladies vs Goldsmiths
The odds were stacked against us
in this match. The pitch was like
a ploughed field and Goldsmiths
hadn't realised they were playing
a non-contact sport. Despite this
we triumphed with two goals
from "Lt. Worf' and one goal
from our sweeper "muss moose".
This didn't quite match up to
last weeks performance, but
we're still undefeated in both
leagues!
Hockey
IC Ladies 2nd vsUCH 2nd
A frustrating game, first because
it was reduced in length, and
second because our opposition
only had nine players! Attack
after attack followed, but the ball
didn't want to go in the goal.

IC Men 2nd Team vs IC Men 3rd Team
2nd Team 0
It was a garni of two halves, the boyz done well, and it wasn't over
'till the refer :e blew the whistle.
We were three up after twenty minutes, very luckily Hue to a
Dennis Nadarajahdnnhle and a spfrrarnlar nwn goal. Rnb Ochola
scored early in the secoiid half, but then Tai, their captain, brought
down M . Plummer in thevbox. Dennis converted from the spot to
claim his hat-trick.
Tai then redeemed himsen^by^seoring a blinder, beating a
flapping D. Groves to make it 4-3 to us. Ed Jenkins, our captain,
actually woke up to do something, crossing (excellently) for Dennis
to get his fourth. Hajo got one back for them after some dodgy
defending. We then clung on to win j-4.
3rd Team H
The result of the most eagerly awaited game of the season was a nine
goal thriller. The first twenty minutes saw us in control, but then
they scored via an own goal by Joachim Cukowicz. Two more goals
followed, so from a position of control we were now 3-0 down. They
then started to dictate the pa^rrrrrfplay, but Rob Ochola gave us a
glimmer of hope when he sfjrang the off-srde trap to finish coolly just
before half-time. / \
At the start of the sepond half we piled on) the pressure and scored
again throug i Rob to make the score 3-2. Dennis Nadara ah restored
their two gos 1 lead after converting a penalty, conceded by our
captain Taiwo Dauda. Taiwo replied a few minutes later with a
stunning leftj-foot strike from twenty yards. Dennis score i his fourth
scored for usi

Well done to Juliet on her

Following a disappointing
performance we crashed out of
the UAU, losing to UCL. Thanks
to the supporters who turned up
and Roger P. who bought a
conciliation jug for the team.
We must now look forward, a
heavy schedule sees us playing as
defending champions in the
Gutteridge Cup and also taking
part in the new ULU league.
We would like to see an
increased level of commitment
towards training to get the team
to play the quality rugby it is
capable of.

IC Ladies vs LSE
We eventually managed to play
LSE, a match which had
previously been cancelled due to
a dangerous pitch (not ours this
time). We started well and soon
took a convincing lead. In spite of
the lack of qualified umpires
(provided by LSE) IC stuck to
the rules. Some very peculiar
decisions by the umpires led to
frustration, but by the second
quarter we were far enough ahead
to see the funny side of it.
Towards the end we relaxed a
little, allowing their score to
reach double figures. It was a well
deserved result from an
interesting and sometimes
scrappy game.

Third race in the London Colleges' League (at Wimbledon)
The IC women yet again dominated the leading bunch, the
team winning for the third successive race. The men, despite
suffering from a number of injuries, performed well with the
team finishing fifth.
Andy and Oliver will both represent ULU at Southampton
on Saturday. Emily, Jenny, Kay and Christina will soon be
travelling to Osaka, Japan, to represent ULU in the University
Ekiden Championships.
