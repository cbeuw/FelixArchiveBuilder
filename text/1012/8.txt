experiment to make a judgement that they
believe the world works a certain way.
Equally, but with a lot lower level of
acceptability, one can find patterns in
cultural behaviour and make judgements
from this behaviour. Culture guides the
beliefs and free-time activities of people.
If you were watching the excellent film
Silence of the Lambs on television a while
back, one aspect of their culture was evident.
Compare if you will Hannibal Lecter with
ITV's favourite hero, James Bond. We all
know James: he is intelligent, strong and
resourceful, with a quick mind, an ability to
adapt to new situations and fluency with
the Lambs Lectcr sits in the villain's chair.
The thinking man is cruel, vicious,

This suggests that in America,
intelligence is associated with evil. It's a
me in films over the past 20
years. Another example is in the lilin I);,
I'm stupid?", "If you think about it..." and
"Imagine if...". Apparently inconsequential,
the difference is a psychological permission
to think or not to think.
When the differences between people's
ability to think become small, there's little
way to differentiate between them except by
appearance. Looks are the only part of a
person's character not needing verbal
substantiation. The image is very important
to American youth. In this country we wear a
school uniform. The

terrorist, standing in front of a list of
company employees on that floor, adapts the
character he thinks suitable to the employee
name William Smith in the seconds it takes
to turn around. In an instant he is a
snivelling office clerk. The villain is thus
again shown to be quick-thinking.
The theme of evil associated with
intelligence is seen as a justification for not
being intelligent. If you were a kid looking
for a role model, would you choose someone
evil? I don't think so. American films use
phrases like "No-one likes a smartarse" and
"I don't pay you to think!". English films
have included phrases such as "Do you think
emphasis in
lifferentiating between
people at school has to be
the way they act; maybe even the way they
think. But kids in American non-fee-paying
schools don't wear uniform. Being cool in
American schools is a matter of money.
Good-looking clothes, even plastic surgery,
can be bought if one can afford it - the
emphasis is on money and natural good looks.
Bringing these points together, one can
judge this behaviour as evidence of American
culture. When thinking is (sub)consciously
seen to be bad, does it not make for an
ignorant and unquestioning race of people?
The British have cultural permission to
think, Americans do not. The conclusion is
therefore that, in general, culture can provide
the ability for independent thought. Reject
Americanism? Kaizen
