in the rye ^ a well connected revolution
It looks like the Tate Gallery are
expecting their exhibition of
pictures by the 19th century
American artist James McNeill
Whistler to be the big artistic
attraction of the next few months.
The ticket booth arrangements
outside on the lawn are certainly
set up with large crowds in mind.
The exhibition itself features over
200 of the artist's works and has
been elaborately prepared.
Whistler was very fussy about the
presentation of his paintings and
at the Tate entire rooms have
been decorated in gold and
Prussian blue.
The range of pictures covers
Whistler's whole career. He began
to make his name in the 1 850s
with a series of detailed etchings
depicting working-class life on the
banks of the Thames. Over the
next decade realism became less
important to him as he explored
composition and mood. It's with
the culmination of this trend, the
gorgeous and atmospheric
Nocturnes of the 1870s, that the
exhibition really takes off.
In 1 877 the famous
'Nocturne in Black and Gold: The
Falling Rocket' became the subject
of a notorious libel trial: Whistler
sued the influential art critic John
Ruskin, who had accused him of
"flinging a pot of paint in the
public's face". When the judge
wanted to know if Whistler really
asked to be paid 200 guineas for
two days' labour, Whistler replied,
"No. I ask it for the knowledge I
have gained in the work of a
lifetime." He won his case, and
was awarded damages of a
farthing.
Most of the Nocturnes are
London scenes, but one of the best
is of St Mark's in Venice. It's a
haunting depiction of a building
that can all too often turn out
looking like a Baroque jelly mould
or heap of profiteroles. These
remarkable paintings don't
reproduce well, and really need to
be seen in the original.
After the Nocturnes, much of
what follows is an anticlimax. But
there are a couple of beautiful
portraits in later rooms. An
'Arrangement in Grey and
Mother-of-Pearl' is a silvery
depiction of the artist's sister-in-
law. There's also one of Lady
Archibald Campbell, which her
relatives objected to on the
grounds that it made her look like
"a street walker". There was too
much ankle! 0

A film's value is not defined by its
director, stars, philosophy or
historical foundation but by whether
its audience enjoys it. For all of the
thought in Trois Couleurs Rouge
by the end you get the feeling that
it has become driven by cleverness
and not by emotion.
Set in Switzerland, the film
shows us the image of modern
Europe. Naturally beautiful, well
connected, rich, secular and aryan,
the country is just like the heroine.
Valentine (Irene Jacob) is a model,
whose face sells chewing gum from
a giant hoarding. Her boyfriend is
away in England and they can only
talk on the phone.
As a concept which encourages
the mental divorce and dependence
at the same time, the telephone is a
totem which runs throughout the
film. We rush upstairs for it and it
cuts out before we get there. It
provides anonymity for anger, erotic
frisson for those who manage to
break into its privacy and ultimately
a wall to hide behind when face to
face becomes snarl to bite. In a film
supposedly about brotherhood, the
phone is the biggest actor.
When she runs over a dog,
Valentine takes it back to its owner.
So while her boyfriend can only get
the answerphone, she is living a
real life, meeting someone strange.
The dog's owner is a retired and
nameless judge (Jean-Louis
Trintignant). A bitter old man, he
gets his kicks listening into the
neighbours' phone calls, knowing
every airborne secret and predicting
what will become. Just as
Valentine's disgust is turned to
helplessness so their relationship
grows into something uneasily like
love. And this is where 'Three
Colours Red' begins its overthought
spiral downwards. Age is the only
barrier between them but in the
modern brotherhood that is
enough. Valentine is the Judge's
salvation and he is sacrificed to
cinematic philosophy. In a film so
full of forced parallels it could pass
for an aerial photograph of
Clapham Junction, Auguste, a
young trainee magistrate, takes up
the older man's role and love. Yet
it's a poor deal for Valentine, not
least because Auguste is dull as
well as being a lawyer.
At the end 'Three Colours Red'
degenerates as the pressure of
loose ends from three films is left
unsolved and hurriedly knotted
together in a skein of threads. Just
as in the last scene Valentine the
chewing gum icon mirrors and
cheapens Valentine the survivor, so
'Three Colours Red' becomes a pale
reflection of what made it
watchable. At heart love does not
recognise age and audiences will
feel cheated when their emotional
bonds are transplanted from real
heroes to flatlining doppelgdngers.
In Final Combination Michael
Madsen (the psychopathic Mr
Blonde from Reservoir Dogs) plays
LA cop Matt Dickson. He's hunting
Richard Welton, a killer boxer
played by Gary Stretch. Dickson is
asthmatic and not exactly sylph-like.
Nevertheless two bone-crunching
encounters with Welton leave him
each time with nothing more than a
sticking-plaster above his right
eyebrow.
This is a run-of-the-mill thriller,
with three or four suspenseful
moments. Welton's kinky obsession
with sex phone lines looks promising
but remains disappointingly
undeveloped. The love interest is
Lisa Sonet, aka Denise Huxtable
from the Cosby show, ex-Mrs Lenny
Kravitz etc. There's lots of slugging
('man to man' of course), some
shooting, a car chase, and ... er,
that's it.
Acting is all that Jamie (Jennifer
Rubin) wants to do in the
P l a y m a k e r . Her current soap
opera job is at a standstill, she has
a drink problem, low self
confidence and a useless agent; she
is desperate for a big leading role.
When she finally gets an audition
for the role for a new film she turns
to acting coach, Ross Talbert (Colin
Firth) for some pre-audition
training. However Talbert's teaching
methods are totally unconventional.
He plays psychological games with
the intention of bringing out Jamie's
true potential. Then, in a turnaround,
the roles are reversed and Jamie
becomes the initiator, commanding
each action. The acting lessons
have obviously been very effective.
Up to this point in the story I
was quite enthralled with the
psychological games, though
sometimes being on the slightly
sadistic side, but from then on the
plot became really quite silly. It
ended up a bit of a farce. 0
