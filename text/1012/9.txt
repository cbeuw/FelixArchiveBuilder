Quite Contrary
Language evolves they tell me, but I'll be
buggered if I'm going to wait seven million
years before I see the end of waste not want
not. Fine, I reply. Just give me the address of a
needy Rwandan and I'll send off this inedible
mound in the morning. Better still, I'll post it to
the person responsible for proverbs and
adages. And I hope he or she chokes on it.
"Give me the
address of a needy
Rwandan..."
Let's face it, why do we bother? Have you
ever had a conversation where the timely
insertion of make hay while the sun shines has
added some much-needed colour? Maybe on
first hearing it did, but certainly not now. In
fact, only slightly less tedious than the grass-
court version, is Proverb Tennis. Beware of the
elderly when you indulge in Proverb Tennis
because they are the Monica Seles' of this
particular verbal joust. As I climbed up to
change Mrs Miggins' bulb, I ask her to hold the
ladder steady.
"Many hands make light work" I say with
some considerable inspiration. Not wanting to
budge from the comfy chair, she looks up.
"Too many cooks spoil the broth" she
lashes down the line. I grit my teeth. Where are
the deranged Steffi Graf fans when you need
them?
The only way to win in Proverb Tennis is
to stop playing the game. As Mrs Miggins
serves "A stitch in time...", return to her feet,
"... except at the Barts A&E." And when she lobs
with "Love will conquer all...", soar to the
heights of "... except in tennis."
"It only takes a
second to score..."
The new attempts at proverbs are just as
bad. When Lenny Henry described something
as "a bit British Telecom", did he mean out of
order, or a shining Tory example of
privatisation as the source of increased
consumer satisfaction? And what was Brian
Clough talking about when he said 'It only
takes a second to score'? More like an evening
of six pints, getting your mate to ask her mate
and countless embarrassed grins.
God help the misguided fool who tries to
strike up conversation with "Does this glass
look half empty or half full to you?"
"Definitely empty" I will say as I pour it
over his unoriginal little head.

It's sad, but the structure of the world is such
that to get your voice heard by anyone in power
in this great democracy, drastic measures are
required. At one time peaceful protests may
have been enough to achieve something; but I
remember the miners' strike of 1 985. That was
peacefulish, that achieved nothing. The last
anti-criminal justice bill demonstration will not
do anything to prevent the criminal justice bill.
Do these people honestly think their opinion
counts for anything with Mr Major? If he wants
to stop hunt saboteurs and travellers from their
pierced nippled excesses, and ravers from their
drug crazed abandon, it is not an issue of
whether this is an infringement of human rights.
It is all about the appeasement of the land
owning gentry, and the easily disgusted anal
english, with their satellite dishes and golf club
aspirations. This is a tory Prime Minister - do the
protesters think he gives an anal wart about
democracy? They must be mad.
The only way to change people's lives, the
only way to get your voice heard in the world is
to kill. To kill and bomb and shoot and maim.
From taking the beatings of the B-specials on
the streets of Belfast in the civil rights marches
of 1969, to the Downing Street negotiating
table in 1994. A long hard struggle, but a
victory. One made possible through atrocities
like Warrenpoinf, and Enniskillen, the Guildford
pub bombings, crossborder shootings of soldiers
on checkpoints, and dead children on the streets
of English cities. These are the lengths it is
necessary to go to change your world. The piles
of severed arms from the Vietnamese children
who had been vaccinated by the american army
lying in the middle of the village as a reminder
from the Viet Cong to anyone in doubt of their
motivation. That is commitment. That is drive. I
f
you want to change the world, buy a gun. I
f you
want to show everyone what a caring and
compassionate civil libertarian you are, stay in
bed. The criminal justice bill will be there long
after you, and deservedly so. I for one don't give
a damn about travellers or hunt saboteurs. Not
really, certainly not enough to get out of bed
and walk about with placards in hyde park.
"You saw the video, you heard the sound track,
now buy the soft drink."
