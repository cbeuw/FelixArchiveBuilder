Thai Tech Transfer
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Imperial College is to receive a
new electronics lab with the help
of a Thai institution.
Mahanakorn University, based
in suburban Bangkok and descr-
ibed as 'the biggest and fastest
growing technology institution
in Thailand', is to fund a new
integrated circuit design lab-
oratory.
The laboratory, to be located
on the 9th floor of the Electrical
and Electronic Engineering
building, will provide Maha-
nakorn University with Imperial
College technology and allow
'the highest quality' Thai
students to train at Imperial.
A similar laboratory will be
set up in Thailand. Its aim will
be to duplicate work done at
Imperial with research feedback
passing in both directions. The
Thai laboratory may enable IC
staff to run courses and provide
consultancy services. It will also
allow British educated students
to continue their work in
Thailand.
Speaking to F E L I X , Dr
Chris Toumazou of the
Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, said:
"It's a shame, these guys are so
bright, but they don't have the
facilities [in Thailand]." The
new scheme will attempt to
resolve the situation, the Thai
students being what he describes
as, "vehicles for technology
transfer to the Far East".
The agreement should allow
Thailand the opportunity to
collaborate internationally in the
field of electronics which has
applications in areas such as
medicine and mobile comm-
unications. Work in these fields
is also to be conducted in the
new lab at Imperial which will be
available to postgraduates and
undergraduates of the
department.
The new laboratory will
mark a new phase of cooperation
between Imperial and Maha-
nakorn, which has funded a
readership and has been sending
PhD students to IC for the last
couple of years. In all, the
department has been endowed
with over £600k from Maha-
nakorn. The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, said, "Imperial is
pleased to share its expertise
with Mahanakorn both by
persuing joint research projects
and training its academic staff."
Though the scheme is
separate from the one under
consultation in College (FELIX
1010) Dr Toumazou said that the
new project would complement
the previous one 'as part of IC's
continuing programme of links
with the Far East'.
Forgery
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Imperial has been bombarded
with a spate of forged bank notes
in the past week.
Several false £20 notes have
been cashed at Southside and in
the Union bar. Hari Nair,
manager of the Imperial Branch
of the National Westminster
Bank, said that a number of the
forgeries had also been found at
the bank.
However, Terry Briley,
Deputy Head of Security, said
that the problem was essentialy a
matter for the police to deal with.
"It's very difficult to trace the
culprits of this kind of crime,"
he said. Bar staff have been
issued with guidelines to help
them identify the notes, and
have been asked to try and
identify those who are passing
them.

It is 4:30am; the second time this
week I've noted the existence of
this hour. The first was in worse
surroundings than chilly FELIX
T O W E R S - it was the casualty
department of the Chelsea and
Westminster Hospital.
How can I write? Do I drip
with blood or sway woozy with
another swig of gas? Luckily my
casualty trip proved a false alarm.
The journey began on Sunday
when I hit my head on a wooden
chair. Jerking upwards I found
the walls, table and piles of
clothes shiny and indistinct. I
found it unlikely that my two-
week old laundry pile had been
imbued with any mystical aura
and besides, the brightness was
giving way to mistyness. "My left
eye is going blind", I said to a
friend who peered in. "Lie
down," she said, and I did. If I
closed the (good) right eye my
vision was reduced to a receding
pool of clarity within a
expanding circle of frosted glass.
Within a minute it glazed over.
I would like to say at this
point I became hysterical but I'm
too staid for that. Instead I
remembered a similar incident
ten years ago, when my vision
went red in a school assembly
and I thought I was being dealt
with harshly by an unknown
force (for only mouthing the
words to an uninspiring hymn).
Isabel turned off the lights,
presumably so there was nothing
to see and thus my blindness
would be cured. But I could see
blurry fishlike lights. It was
almost like an optical 'stitch',
where you kneel down and hope
that when you stand the pain will
be gone but you never know...
The stupid thing was that
when my vision did return I
forgot to be scared and carried on
with the day. On Monday I asked
everyone I saw about it, even the
psycho martial artists and the
Mary's medics. It was, of course,
Waterstones who clinched it. I
simply should buy my own
Family Health Diagnostic Guide. It
would have worked out great
value by now considering the
number of diseases it has
diagnosed for me (okay, so not all
of those have fully bloomed yet
but a problem forewarned is a
disaster halved...) Anyway:
Vision>Temporary Blindness
> Emergency> Doctor.
Now I panic. Having delayed
my emergency session by 30
hours I delay a little longer to
read that I may have a blood clot,
a brain tumour or worse.
Panicking, I run around the
office for an hour telling
everyone how bad it is. 'Go to
Casualty!' they chorus. 'After
collating Guildsheet!' I reply and
make Guildsheet assistant editor
Andy Sinharay's night awful by
insisting graphically how bad my
delayed medical attention is.
At 9:30pm I leave F E L I X
and walk to the Hospital. It
seems ridiculous to stroll down to
the Accident and Emergency
department. Where is the
'Paranoid and Unorganised'
Wing? I look through the
goldfish glass at scores of waiting
people. "Hmmmm..." mutters
Tim, who had wandered out from
Harts. "You'll need a good
shotgun wound to jump that
queue..." Foolishly I ignore him
and wait five hours for the
Doctor to tell me I was probably
okay. In the meantime I had
spent yet another chunk of my
life in a medical institution
growing humble at scenes of
madness, patience, a naked old
women clutching her purse as
she's wheeled by, a RCM student
scared she'd lost a finger, a bloke
in a tux ring 'Vinnie' to say the
"money is okay", a conversation
between a male doctor and a
stout patient who said to his
friend "You could have stuck
your finger up there at home"
and an argument over whether a
seventeen year old girl should be
forced to take a taxi home.
