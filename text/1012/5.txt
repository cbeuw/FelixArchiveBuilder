Help Out
Dear Felix,
I sympathise with Jane Hoyle's
complaint about homophobia at
IC. The challenge of establishing
one's personal identity is not
helped by the facetious reply which
followed her letter or by the lack of
information in freshers' week.
IC is not an isolated campus,
and the anonymity of London offers
many ways of coming out. I
strongly recommend social groups
such as the ULU GaySoc for your
first move.
You'll find a friendly mix of
students (and non-students), from
every college, every subject area
and every background, and if you
met them on campus you'd
probably never guess that they
were gay. There are several other
coming out and youth groups, such
as at London Friend.
Here are some other ways in to
the gay world. Once you're in,
there are free newspapers which
tell you about bars, nightclubs,
films, contact ads and so on.
It took me six years to realise
that there were other gay students
like me: please don't be as stupid
as I was!

Much as students here may fondly
imagine themselves broadminded,
the college is riddled with as much
prejudice as anywhere else
especially where matters such as
homosexuality are concerned. There
is still a depressing level of crass
bigotry about this subject, both from
society and the media. Coming 'out'
can be a difficult, courageous act,
and any support is useful.
I am sure that some will find the
contacts listed helpful. Although it is
often said that the sprawling
metropolis of London caters for
every need, finding what you want
is a different matter - and Imperial
is not the easiest place to start
looking.
Letters may be
