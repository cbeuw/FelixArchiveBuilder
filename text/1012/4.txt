Pressure
Dear Felix,
I thought what an excellent
editorial you wrote on police
bashing two weeks ago. It
addressed the demonstration from
the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen
rather than from the usual trendy
student direction. However I noted
with disappointment that you
lapsed back into the usual pattern
after pressure from the 'right on
gang'. I also fail to see the
connection between the Criminal
Justice Bill & Special branch. In
fact you say "Although not directly
related" so why bother to mention
it? Perhaps it was merely a vehicle
to slip in a joke about the
'criminally unjustifiable bill'. Boom!
Boom!
You fail to realise the purpose of
Special Branch's surveillance
activities - they are not there to
infringe civil rights as you imply,
but to uphold and protect our
democratic system. Some, but by
no means all of these activists seek
to overthrow or undermine our
parliamentary democracy by many
methods. No-one can deny that.
To seek to stop these surveillance
activities would be madness and in
a roundabout fashion would cause
the whole nations civil rights to be
infringed.
Your comments about a police
state are absolute stuff and
nonsense. I feel that if you lived in
a police state you would certainly
know about it and probably have
had your editorial blacked out by
now. If we were living in the Soviet
Union under the KGB and GRU
your comments might have been
acceptable and I am sorry but
frankly the suggestion that the
United Kingdom in a police state
offends me. Perhaps you should
move to certain countries in South
America or South East Asia and you
could find out what a police state is
actually like.
Yours sincerely

Too darn right. It's about time
people stopped jumping onto these
bandwagons and started to question
things for themselves. The CJB may
not be so bad. Does it really matter
if demonstrations are criminalised?
When was the last time a
demonstration had any effect on
politics? After all, politicians have
not got where they are today by
going against the system - they are
in it, they love it. Do you honestly
think they have any respect for a
mob of scruffy, long haired youths
who are just looking for the first
excuse to smash a brick over a
policeman's head? Get real. If you
want to change the system then
work with it. Buy a suit.
As for the Special Branch, of
course they are needed. A system
cannot work without somebody to
govern it, especially if a proportion
of the population is out to destroy
the system wherever they can. So
give the Special Branch a round of
applause!
Butt Out!!
Dear All,
As you are no doubt well aware, it
is near the end of Rag Week with
only a few events left, a few events
that are often under-subscribed to.
Also, this lunchtime there is a UGM
in the Ents Lounge of the Union
Building. In order that these last
few events are better attended, and
to liven up the proceedings, a
motion has been proposed to this
meeting encouraging the
participation of the Sabbaticals in
the Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump. However if this
meeting is also poorly attended, it
is possible that their own
reluctance to get involved in Rag
will prevent the motion from being
passed.
Therefore we call for all those of
a mind to encourage the Sabbs to
'get their kit off for charity' should
turn up with their Union cards on
Friday lunchtime at 1:00 pm and
vote en masse for this motion. It
should be noted that at least 100
students are needed to make this
meeting quorate, so bring your
friends, family and pets along too.
For those of you worried for the
safety of the Sabbs, you needn't
be, the most damage they will
receive is sunburn from each
others' embarrassment, I know
because I have done 'the jump'
myself.
If you cannot make it on Friday,
sponsor somebody or come along
on Saturday to cheer at this
lighthearted piece of fun. I
f the
motion mysteriously does not make
it to the UGM, it was last seen on
Ian Parish's desk on Monday, and
that will have a lot to say about the
bureaucracy in the Union.

Well, if there are still a few people
who find sponsored indecency
amusing, then they are quite
welcome to it. However, the fact
that this 'hilarious' event is so poorly
attended speaks for itself. Is this act
of gross illegality so funny? I think
not. Attempting to make the Sabbs
do the same is rather pathetic. As
for the idea that you may actually
be able to make Quorum, that
seems about as probable as myself
winning the National Lottery,
without a ticket. But if you do
manage to get people to go to a
UGM, then I shall eat my words, as I
too know how popular they are.
Light of Truth.
Dear Felix,
I am one of the rare breed of
introspective individuals of whom
dear Frater would so passionately
approve. In responding to some
points raised by him last week my
intention is not to flout my own
opinions but hopefully to simply
foment a more vibrant debate.
Perhaps we must start by asking
the most fundamental question,
What is truth (enlightenment)?
Is it an achievement or a goal or an
abstract concept to be eulogised
and coveted? Can truth be
defined within the parameters of
human value? In asking these
questions I am not seeking to form
a conclusion, for a conclusive mind
is surely a closed mind. Can a
mind shackled and restricted by the
ever pervading myriad conditioning
influences ever act but within a
'narrow diffused sphere'? Can
such a mind so conditioned by
ambition, fear and greed ever
know that which is limitless,
unquantifiable, absolute? Note, I
am making no claims, I am
drawing no conclusions, but merely
asking, exploring this question of
truth.
If truth is an absolute entity can
there by paths leading to it? Is not
truth its own reference? Think
about it, don't jump to instant and
unconsidered reactions. Consider
the sages, seers and mystics
walking this path - is not walking a
path with hope of reward in itself
inherently ambitious? Is what they
achieve truth or is it merely a
mental projection of their own
created virtue? Is not forsaking all
worldly possessions and embarking
on a life of penance and sanctity
worthless if the initiator and
catalyst is ambition? The
difference between worldly and
spiritual ambition is only in degree
not in kind. If you search with
expectation then how can you find
anything but that which satiates
your own desires? Must not all
explorations therefore be totally,
unequivocally and unconditionally
free from from all conditioning
influences? Truth is surely of the
present, it is with us every moment
of our lives. In the words of
Emerson, "Each moment has its
own beauty. One never seen
before and never to be seen
again". So it is with truth.
Yours sincerely

Hmmm. Such an interesting letter
deserves a considered response. I
think that one must first ask ,"ls
truth enlightenment?". I feel they
differ. Enlightenment can most
usefully be classed as a path
towards losing one's shackles and
conditioning influences and gaining
a clear understanding. Note that it
is a path, and not a goal; as Kedar
states, aiming for a goal implies
ambition, and ambition is contrary
to enlightenment.
Truth, however, differs. It is 'of
the moment' and has no clear
underlying meaning. If any truth is
reached through the path of light, it
is the Meta Truth behind that of
normal existence. One must
remember that with each skin shed,
another lies beneath. Upon
consulting my acquaintance, your
good Frater, he simply replied by
quoting, "Aha!".
