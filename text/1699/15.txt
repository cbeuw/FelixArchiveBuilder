Zombie cells

T
he zombies are
here, except
turns out it’s on
a cellular scale,
so stop boarding up your
windows and pick up
that microscope! In new
research from Dr Baker at
the Mayo Clinic, scientists
found that removing se-
nescent cells, also known
as ‘zombie’ cells, reduced
symptoms associated with
age related degenerative
diseases.
Senescent cells are
unable to perform the
functions of a normal
cell but are unable to
die, meaning that they
build up over time and
are associated with a
number of age-related
diseases including ather-
osclerosis, osteoarthritis
and Alzheimer’s. It had
been thought that these
were simply innocent by-
standers that do not cause
damage, however recent
work has suggested that
they release inflammatory
signals, which disturb the
surrounding cells.
Scientists found that
when they cleared se-
nescent cells in the mice
brains, using a genetically
modified enzyme, the
mice retained the ability to
form new memories and
showed reduced outward
signs of cognitive decline.
They were also able to
identify that two types of
brain cells, ‘microglia’
and ‘astrocytes’, were the
types that became senes-
cent. These are immune
cells linked to neuronal
health and signalling.
This is one of the first
pieces of evidence that
senescent cells play a
role in neurodegenerative
diseases and opens po-
tential new avenues for
treatment. The scientist,
in this study, also used
drugs that have been
shown to damage senes-
cent cells to see if the
drugs had a similar effect
to the enzyme. When the
drug was administered
for the first six months
of the mouse’s life, their
brains had fewer tangles
of a protein called tau,
a marker of cognitive
decline.
Whilst these findings
are promising, a cure
for neurodegenerative
diseases isn’t quite on
the horizon yet. The
approach taken in these
experiments represents
the best-case scenario
and would be difficult to
apply clinically as it was
a preventative measure.
Also, targeted treatments
can be difficult, as older
people tend to have lots of
cells that look like these
harmful senescent cells,
and so it remains to be
seen if a treatment can
distinguish between the
two.
In the future, Dr Baker
and his team will focus
on treating animals after
the disease has started,
looking at specific alter-
ations that happen on a
molecular scale in the
cells they identify.
Bacteria in poop: the key to losing weight?
S
ummer is offi-
cially over and,
temporarily, we
don’t need our
summer bodies. However,
losing weight is not just
about looking nice on
sandy beaches; obesity is
one of the key risk factors
that causes cardiovascular
disease and other chronic
diseases.
Obesity is a multi-facet
condition: genetics,
activity level and diet all
contribute. Solutions to
this issue are obviously to
exercise and eat healthily.
On the extreme side,
surgery is also an option.
However, associated risks
can be severe, and there-
fore only morbidly obese
individuals are offered
this treatment in the UK.
Recently, the role of the
immune system in obesity
has also been investigated.
There are many different
populations of micro-
organisms living in our
digestive tracts, known as
gut flora. The relationship
between gut flora and us
can be beneficial; some
help us digest dietary fibre
in vegetables, breaking it
down so we can absorb
it. Gut flora also produce
vitamin B and K for us
and prevent the growth of
harmful organisms.
Nevertheless, like a
well-organised company,
this beneficial effect only
works with a specific
population of flora. In
a company, we need
a certain number of
employees, each with
different talents and roles.
That way, the company
can efficiently carry out
its daily routine. If most of
the employees decided to
quit one day, the company
would face crisis and less
ideal candidates may be
hired to keep the company
going.
Antibiotics, like an
economic crisis to our
imaginary company, can
wipe out the good bacteria
and affect the host’s
ability to digest food. The
absence of these florae
may also fail to stop
pathogens from growing,
leading to diarrhoea. Fur-
thermore, it has also been
shown that people who are
obese have a different gut
flora profile. While it is
unclear whether the shift
in gut flora population
causes obesity or the other
way around, there is cer-
tainly a clear association
between the two.
The shift in gut flora
profile activates the
immune system, exac-
erbating the situation
and increases the risk of
cancer and autoimmune
diseases. A research group
in the University of North
Carolina has tried to
manipulate the immune
system in mice to inves-
tigate its effect in obesity.
They suspected that
high-fat diet induces the
imbalance of the delicate
gut flora ecosystem by
increasing inflammatory
response in the body.
NLRP12, a leucine-rich
repeating protein (NLRP),
is a mediator of the
immune system and
promotes the resolution
of inflammation. None-
theless, its role in obesity
is unknown in reality. To
investigate, the research-
ers hypothesised NLRP12
can reduce weight gain
by damping down the
immune system and
reducing inflammation
to the gut and fat tissue
whilst the removal of this
protein would have the
opposite effect. Putting
the theory to test, the
scientists knocked out the
gene coding for NLRP12,
Senescent cells can lead to Alzheimer’s//Wikimedia
so the mice didn’t have
these receptors in their
cells.
As a result, these
knockout animals were
relatively fatter despite
having the same diet and
lifestyle as the control
group. These mice were
also less sensitive to
insulin,makingthemmore
susceptible to diabetes.
The obese mice also had
more immune cells in
their fat tissue, with a very
specific pro-inflammatory
cell population (M1 mac-
rophages). Elevated levels
of pro-inflammatory cell
signalling molecules, like
TNF (tumour necrosis
factor) and IL-6 (interleu-
kin-6), which are released
from the fat tissue, were
also found in the obese
mice.
Furthermore, analysing
the gut microbiome in
the mice, they found that
mice with a high-fat diet
and NLRP12 knockout
had a lower bacterial
diversity in the intestine,
correlating to inflamma-
tion and obesity. Faecal
transplants from obese
mice to other mice also
promote weight gain
and putting normal and
knockout mice together
in one cage can reduce
obesity in the knockouts
by coprophagic-transfer
of microorganisms
(poop-eating). Upon
analysing the popula-
tion, the researchers
also identified families
of bacteria that are more
predominant in obese
mice, namely, the Erysip-
elotrichaceae promotes
weight gain. Contrarily,
the Lachnospiraceae
family seemingly has
a beneficial effect on
weight loss.
While faecal trans-
plant seems unhygienic
anddifficulttoimplement
in humans, chemical
products that the good
bacteria produce could
potentially be packaged
as supplements to treat
diabetes and obesity.
Though more experi-
mental data is required
to verify the beneficial
bacterial population, this
strategy is certainly a rel-
atively inexpensive and
easy (in terms of lifestyle
changes) solution.
