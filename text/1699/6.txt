My Visit to Labour Conference: Thoughts on
the Government in Waiting
President of Imperial Labour Society, Ansh Bhatnagar, shares his views on the 2018 Labour
Party Conference

Ansh Bhatnagar
President of Imperial
Labour Society
L
ast week, I
travelled along
with three other
Imperial students
to the annual Labour Party
Conference, this year
held in the great city of
Liverpool. After a long,
difficult summer in the
party, with lots of division
between the two factional
wings, I didn’t know if I
should be looking forward
to the coming few days.
Firstly, a bit of back-
ground about me: I’m not
someone who is massive-
ly involved in politics;
the first time I paid any
attention to it in the news
was around the 2015
General Election. Having
heard about the tripling
of tuition fees and the end
of maintenance grants, as
well as wider issues such
as the real terms cuts to
the NHS and our schools,
it seemed to me that
Labour was the only party
talking about these issues
and taking them seriously.
Unfortunately, I was
too young to vote in that
election. Fast forward
to when I came to uni in
2016 and decided to join
both the Labour Party
and the Labour Society
at Imperial. It was great
to have a place to meet
so many like-minded
people who also felt that
our current system is
incredibly unjust, and to
organise campaigning
efforts together in the
2017 General Election.
Two years on, I am now
it’s President.
Looking back to last
week; I had never been
to a political party con-
ference before and was
unsure of what to expect.
Would it just consist of
long and boring discus-
sions about the minute
details of some obscure
policy? 13,000 people,
including hundreds of
Young Labour members,
were descending on Liv-
erpool, so I knew it had to
be more than just that.
Policy was indeed
discussed and debated, in
a packed conference hall
full of thousands of CLP
(Constituency Labour
Party) and trade union
delegates. This is the
centre of the Conference,
as Labour under Jeremy
Corbyn has been increas-
ingly trying to become a
member-led party where
ordinary people like you
and me have influence
over the policies that
a Labour Government
would adopt. This gradual
democratisation of the
Party is clearly winning
over swing voters: in the
2017 General Election,
Labour, with its brave and
transformative manifesto,
gained the largest increase
in vote share since 1945.
These policies are winning
the debate because they’re
being crafted by ordinary
people, many of whom
have directly suffered the
consequences of austerity
under the Tories for the
last 8 years.
While debating and
making important policy
decisions for the next
Labour government is
incredibly important, it’s
the fringe events where
Conference truly shines.
These include panel
discussion, Q&As, and
interviews with Labour
politicians and activists,
and are hosted by all
sorts of associated organ-
isations in the Conference
venue. Outside the venue,
a fringe politics, arts,
and music festival called
The World Transformed
(TWT) runs alongside the
Labour Conference, now
in its third year.
Upon arrival at Liv-
erpool on Saturday, we
decided to attend the
relaunch of Tribune
magazine, being hosted
at TWT. Tribune is the
traditional magazine of
football tournament. A
few years ago, it would’ve
been hard to believe that
such events are running
alongside a *political*
conference, but a lot
has changed since then.
Politics is being reinvig-
orated by a grassroots
left-wing movement, with
more and more ordinary
people getting involved
every single day and
joining the half-a-million
strong membership of the
Labour Party.

the Labour left, with
contributors and editors
including George Orwell,
Nye Bevan (founder of
the NHS), Barbara Castle
and Michael Foot. Having
faded into obscurity
earlier in the year, it was
relaunched with a bang,
with journalists such as
Owen Jones and Dawn
Foster contributing to the
magazine and speaking at
the event. The crowd had
a diverse mix of young
and old, veterans of the
movement and those new
to it.
Upon looking at the
schedule, we quickly
realised that TWT had
many incredibly diverse
events, from yoga sessions
to reading groups, coding
classes to a 5-a-side
Walking around the
bustling Conference floor
over the next few days
meant rubbing shoulders
with people I’ve only seen
on TV before: people like
Ed Miliband, Owen Jones,
Dianne Abbott, John Mc-
Donnell, David Lammy,
and many many more
commentators and poli-
ticians. Due to this easy
access to the big names in
the Labour movement, we
decided to make a short
video to promote Labour-
Soc. For busy people who
have their calendars full
to the brim, they were
incredibly approachable
and kind enough to record
the video messages for us.
Being at Conference
wasn’t just about the
Labour Party – it was also
“13,000
people,
included
hundreds of
Young Labour
mebers, were
descending
into Liverpool”
