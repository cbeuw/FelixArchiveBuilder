M e n t a l
Health Day
on 10th
October, first year med-
ical students at Imperial
College London will be
given the opportunity to
learn more about mental
health support through a
new medical simulation.
The simulation,
designed by third year
Imperial medical students
Amna Ahmed, Joshua
Walton and Thivvi
Gangatharan, will show
students how they can
tackle mental health
problems and encourage
them to seek help at the
earliest opportunity. Iden-
tifying and supporting
students with depression
at an earlier stage can
improve wellbeing and
minimise burnout.
This move comes in
the wake of a recent study
which revealed nearly one
in three medical students
worldwide experiences
depression during their
studies.
that, but when it’s actually
in front of you, you have
to engage with it and we
hope that by getting our
students to witness what
potentially one of their
peers or themselves could
be going through, we
could help prevent that in
the future.”
Depression is said to be
invisible; this simulation
gives a visual depiction
of "invisible" depression.
The trio also aim to tackle
the culture of medicine;
doctors "always have to
be on their A-game" so
they often hide mental
illness. However, the
earlier help is sought, the
safer doctors will be with
their patients.
Hannah Bannister,
the Director of Student
Services, said: “We know
many of the issues that
students may come across
while studying. Some-
times, the most difficult
aspect is knowing how
and when to ask for help.
The work that Joshua,
Amna and Thivvi have
done is fantastic. I’m
really keen to see how the
project and its feedback
can help us with reaching
and encouraging all of our
students to find the right
help at the right time.”

The Hub is led by
the Imperial College
Centre of Engagement
and Simulation Science
(ICCESS), co-directed
by Professor Roger
Kneebone and Dr
Fernando Bello. They are
working in partnership
with Imperial College
NHS Healthcare Trust
and the project is funded
by Imperial Health
Charity.
The College is sup-
porting improved mental
health outcomes for
students by developing
a new Student Support
Strategy, led by Hannah
Bannister. Students can
share their ideas on the
dedicated consultation
page.

“Identifying
and
supporting
students with
depression
at an earlier
stage can
improve
wellbeing”
The aim is to reduce
stigma and increase
awareness about depres-
sion in medical students
as well as highlight
services available to them
via the College and NHS
providers.
Students will watch the
live performance, before
discussing it and sharing
thoughts and feedback
in groups. It depicts a
medical student, played
by an actor, at home,
talking to a friend and de-
scribing typical symptoms
of depression such as
low mood and difficulty
sleeping.
The student then visits
a GP, played by a clini-
cian at Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust.
After discussing medical
history, symptoms
and other background
information, the doctor
expresses their concern to
the student that they may
be depressed, and offers
anti-depressants, cogni-
tive behavioural therapy
and self-care resources
such as support groups
and exercise activities.
Medical simulation is
used in medical training
to re-enact a patient’s
experiences in healthcare.
The three medics behind
the simulation recently sat
down with Maxine Myers
to discuss the perfor-
mance, why they decided
to focus on student mental
health and future plans.
When asked why they
chose medical simulation
as the vehicle to raise
awareness about mental
health, Thivvi explained:
“I think there’s something
quite pertinent in showing
something visually live.
Because it’s all well and
good talking about it on
social media and putting
up posters and things like
“Depression
is said to be
invisible; this
simulation
gives a visual
depiction”

First year medical
students were specifically
targeted because they
will be adjusting to a new
work-life balance after
recently starting univer-
sity. The ultimate aim is
to expand the simulation
to subsequent academic
years and, in the long
term, to even expand to
other universities.
After watching the per-
formance students will be
asked to provide feedback
based on their experience
and to identify areas
where improvements can
be made in accessing
services and support.
The project was carried
out as part of the St Mary’s
Patient Experience Hub,
an initiative designed to
use medical simulation
and tools to improve the
experience of patients
and families at St Mary’s
