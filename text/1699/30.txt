101 Ways to eat Pasta
Follow Felix Food Editors Eva and Julia for another foodie foray!
S
o you’ve got
through your
first week of uni
madness - the wild
balance of parties, events,
and socials with possible
introductory lectures or
just straight up normal
classes. Food this week
has probably just been
frozen pizza, toast, and of
course all the sweets from
Freshers’ Fair because
who has time to cook?
We’d like to say it gets
easier, but for the next
week or two you’ll still
probably still be buying
library cafe sandwiches or
meal deals from Tesco…
but fear not - there is
an alternative. The one
food that is super easy to
prepare, fills you up well
(essential for priming
your stomach for all the
juice you’ll be having of
course) and tastes amaz-
ing - pasta! But rather
than just topping it with
nothing or 99p tomato
concentrate, here’s a few
better, more interesting
ways to eat your pasta:
THE CLASSICS
1
Bolognese
You’ve probably all heard
of this classic, and we’re
not surprised. With how
easy it is to whip up, and
how delicious the results
are, no wonder it’s a fami-
ly favourite!
Pasta of Choice: We
recommend spaghetti or
if you’re feeling more
adventurous, some
macaroni.
What you’ll need:
Onions, carrots, garlic
clove, red wine (optional),
chopped tomatoes,
minced beef & herbs to
season.
Our favourite recipe:
Jamie Oliver’s Spaghetti
Bolognese
2
Carbonara
Another family favourite.
Though a little richer with
all the cream and cheese
involved (yummm, we
know!!), this dish is just
as quick and easy, and
jam-packed with even
more flavour.
Pasta of Choice:
Spaghetti or tagliatelle.
What you’ll need:
Eggs, pancetta ham/
bacon, double cream,
parmesan cheese, butter
& 2 garlic cloves. Salt,
pepper and italian herbs to
season.

Spaghetti Carbonara”

Mac & Cheese
Now this is THE hango-
ver food. Cheese, pasta
and an extra topping of
deliciously golden bread-
crumbs, Mac & Cheese is
the ideal stomach lining
before (and after) a night
out.
Pasta of Choice: Has
to be macaroni.
What you’ll need:
cheese, breadcrumbs,
butter, milk, flour & sea-
sonings.

UP FOR A
CHALLENGE?
1
Butter Noodles
These are absolutely
addictive. No, we mean
like really A D D I C T
I V E. You’ll be out of
your seat reaching for
more before your plate is
even over! But fear not
- we’ve chosen a recipe
that makes a hefty number
of servings so you’ll be
absolutely fine for that.
Pasta of Choice:
(Wide) egg noodles.
What you’ll need:
Chicken broth, bouillon
cube, butter, parmesan,
seasonings and parsley.
Our favourite recipe:
Spicy Southern Kitchen’s
Buttered Noodles
2
Quattro Formaggi
Yet another dish loaded
with cheese. We think
cheese is the solution to
all our problems in life,
to be honest. Relationship
problems? Have some
cheese. Feeling hungover?
Have some cheese. Too
much work to do? Have
some cheese. Your pasta
is too plain? Yep, you’ve
guessed it - have some
cheese!
Pasta of Choice:
Penne.
What you’ll need:
Parmesan, Gorgonzola,
Gruyère, Taleggio (or any
4 cheeses!), whole milk,
salt, pepper, nutmeg and
any other seasonings.
Our favourite recipe:
The Spruce Eats’Italian
Four-Cheese Pasta

Fettuccine Alfredo
This yummy, buttery
bowl of goodness is
undoubtedly going to
melt your heart (and your
tummies!). The flavour
created by the combina-
tion of garlic, cream and
butter is to-die-for and the
thick consistency of the
recipe makes it a heart-
warming, filling favourite.
Pasta of Choice:
Fettuccine.
What you’ll need:
Butter, heavy cream,
cheese, garlic salt, pepper.

PASTA)
BONUS
Puttanesca
Puttanesca translates
to “lady of the night” in
Italian, and though we’re
not entirely sure why
this dish has adopted that
name, we’re assuming it’s
because of its hot, fiery
nature.
Pasta of Choice:
Spaghetti for the win.
What you’ll need:
Chilli, basil, cheese,
garlic, tomatoes, olives,
anchovies, pepper, olive
oil & herbs.
