The Rise of Private Equity

efore the fi-
nancial crisis,
private equity
i n v e s t o r s
followed closely the
“buyout” manual pio-
neered by Henry Kravis
and George Roberts
when they founded the
firm KKR in the 1970’s.
Essentially, they would
acquire companies whole,
then they would cut costs
and load them with low
interest rate debt. For a
while this was very suc-
cessful. Earlier this year
the private equity firm
Blackstone sold its 15.8
million shares in Hilton
Worldwide Holdings,
bringing an end to an
11-year relationship that
ended up as the most
profitable private equity
deal on record ($14 billion
in profit meaning the firm
tripled its investment).
Blackstone took the hotel
private in 2007, with
the firm putting up $6.5
billion of equity. The
firm later suffered during
the financial crisis but
after some more cash and
restructuring of Hilton’s
debt, Blackstone took the
company public again
in 2013. The shares had
more than doubled at the
time of the sale. Despite
this, many critics said this
method was comparable
to cash-rich private equity
firms playing a risky game
of musical chairs.
Now the biggest firms,
including Blackstone,
have changed course
joining a new breed of
lightly regulated “alter-
native” money managers
that have filled the void
as banks are forced to
retreat from risky deals.
Unlike mainstream banks,
which are dependent on
deposits and short-term
funding, these funds raise
capital from long-term in-
stitutional investors such
as insurance and pension
funds. They provide a
crucial source of credit,
sometimes in very uncon-
ventional ways, for com-
panies that have too much
risk to tap into the bond
market. In 2013 Codere,
a Spanish gaming firm,
faced imminent bankrupt-
cy. Its bonds were trading
at just over half-face
value. Blackstone offered
it a cheap $100m loan,
with a catch. Blackstone
had bought credit deriva-
tives on Codere’s debt that
would pay out about $19
million if they defaulted
on a bond payment. So
Codere delayed a payment
by a couple of days to
prompt a “technical
default”. Consequently,
Blackstone got its pay-out
and Codere lived to fight
another day. The investors
who sold Blackstone
credit derivatives had
essentially bet that Codere
was going to live up to its
bond payments. Without
the loan, that most likely
would have been the case
“Buyout
volumes were
up 27% year
on year in
2017 and can
be expected
to accelerate
this year, with
a record $1.1
trillion pledge”
and those investors would
still have paid for their
error. Similarly, in 2017
Blackstone bought $33
million worth of credit
derivatives on Hovnanian,
an American construction
firm. It again offered
cheap financing on the
condition that it trigger
those derivatives to pay
out. One of the credit
default swap sellers,
Solus Asset Management,
a hedge fund, was denied
an injunction to stop the
technical default. Even
though America’s Com-
modity Futures Trading
Commission suggest
technical default may
count as market manipu-
lation, the company falls
under the Securities and
Exchange Commission,
which has said nothing.
Credit default swaps
were intended as a hedge
against losses from
defaults, not a bet on
whether a firm defaults on
its liabilities. However, it
is this alternative thinking
that has led to private
equity firms being so
successful. Funds are
raising more capital than
they can spend. Accord-
ing to Thomson Reuters,
buyout volumes were up
27% year on year in 2017
and can be expected to
accelerate this year, with
a record $1.1 trillion of
cash pledged by inves-
tors. “The private equity
fundraising environment
has been extraordinary”
says Alison Mass, global
head of the financial and
strategic investors group
at Goldman Sachs. “We
are in frequent dialogue
with our largest clients
regarding targets in excess
of $10 billion”. The main
propelling factor for the
boom is the same one that
fuelled the industry before
the 2008 crisis: cheap
debt and huge wall of
cash caused by the huge
amounts of bond buying
by the central banks,
keeping rates down. The
size of recent deals is
beginning to surpass those
pre-crisis peaks with
companies increasing
their dependence on debt
financing.
What is more worrying
is with all this unspent
capital, private equity
firms are now beginning to
eye up buying banks. With
Blackstone’s €1 billion
purchase last week of a
60% stake in Luminor, a
Baltic lender whose return
on equity lags behind
most other Nordic banks,
economists are worried
this marks the start of
a series of acquisitions.
Since both sectors are
highly leveraged boosting
one with the other would
be a very bad idea, a clear
example being the spiral-
ling levels of leverage that
caused the financial crash
a decade ago.
So should investors
return to the asset man-
agement industry for
capital returns? Interest-
ingly, Larry Fink who runs
BlackRock (the world’s
largest asset manager with
$6 trillion of assets) was
the colleague of Stephen
Schwarzman who runs
Blackstone (the largest
private equity firm),
until the two companies
split in 1995. Yet they
both have very different
views on investment and
management strategies.
BlackRock stands for
computing power, low
fees and scale. It mainly
sells passive funds
(including ETFs) to in-
stitutions and the masses.
Meanwhile, Blackstone
represents a combination
of brain power, high fees
and specialisation. It uses
leverage and changes
in the management of
firms to make them more
valuable, clients being
the institutional and the
rich. Measured by sales,
profits and cash returns to
shareholders, BlackRock
is on average 31% larger,
raising seven times the
amount of net client
money cumulatively
over the past decade.
Additionally, BlackRock
made roughly $2.9 trillion
of profits over the past 10
years compared with $202
billion for Blackstone’s
clients and BlackRock is
valued on 25 times profit,
versus 11 for Blackstone,
suggesting that investors
prefer its simple structure,
thinking it will grow
faster. Having said this,
the passive funds Black-
Rock provide are highly
correlated with the overall
stock-market, faring well
in the recent bull run on
the S&P 500, but a slight
crash may put the firm in
serious trouble. As well as
this, although BlackRock
has swathes of power
in corporate America,
holding voting rights in a
large number of large cap
companies, the more it
uses its power to influence
these firms, the more reg-
ulators will scrutinise it.
This is partly why
investors are now seeking
alternative investment
strategies, such as private
equity firms. Even though
asset managers can
provide stable returns, it
is becoming harder and
harder to generate alpha
(gauges the performance
of an investment against
a market index or bench-
mark which is considered
to represent the market’s
movement as a whole).
Therefore, institutional
investors are looking to
more creative schemes to
give them that edge. But
you can’t beat the market
forever.
