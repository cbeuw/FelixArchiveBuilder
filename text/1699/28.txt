The savage public exe-
cution of Theo van Gogh
by Mohammed Bouyeri
was a cataclysmic event
for the people of Holland.
What was van Gogh’s and
Hirsi Ali’s crime? They
criticised the treatment
of women under Islam.
For criticising an idea, in
one of the most free and
liberal Western societies
in the world, they had
been sentenced to death.
Ayaan HirsiAli: The woman who is not afraid to speak
In her first autobiography, activist, feminist and former
politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali writes about her life growing
up from Somalia to Holland. Infidel: My Life charts
her personal journey and relationship with Islam, to
the founder of AHA foundation today, which promotes
liberty from honor killings, female genital mutilation,
and forced marriages.

“A common
running thread
in Infidel is
the power of
belief”
O
ne morning in
A m s t e r d a m ,
on November
2nd 2004, a
man wakes up, has his
breakfast, and hops onto
his old black bicycle to
head to work at his film
production company.
Meanwhile, another man
lies in wait in a doorway,
carrying two knives
and a handgun. As the
cyclist trundles down the
Linnaeusstraat in central
Amsterdam, the other
man approaches, pulls out
his gun, and shoots. He
shoots again. And again.
The cyclist, now wound-
ed, runs to the other side
of the road to escape, but
collapses at the road’s
edge.
The gunman follows
in pursuit, and stands over
the sputtering, bleeding
man. Ignoring his desper-
ate pleas for mercy, the
gunman shoots him four
more times. He then takes
outalargeknife,graspsthe
wounded cyclist’s body
by the head, and saws so
deeply into his throat that
it almost decapitates him.
Finally, with his other
knife, he stabs a five-page
letter onto the dead man’s
chest before fleeing the
scene. This was the brutal
murder of Theo van Gogh
by Mohammed Bouyeri.
The letter called for the
death of Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
Infidel is Ayaan Hirsi
Ali’s first autobiography,
and van Gogh’s murder
was a catastrophic apogee
of her life’s trajectory up
to that point. Born in 1969
in Mogadishu, she writes
about her youth growing
up in Somalia, Saudi
Arabia, Ethiopia, and
Kenya. She describes how
she was forcibly excised
at age 5 by her grand-
mother, how she was
repeatedly beaten by her
mother growing up, and
how an Islamic teacher
once fractured her skull
for disobedience. At age
23, she fled to Holland,
away from an arranged
marriage by her father.
While in Holland,
she achieved a political
science degree from
Leiden University. She
recognised the terrible
threat of Islamic ex-
tremism following 9/11,
and was driven towards
Dutch politics, eventu-
ally becoming an MP
in 2003. She wanted to
put the plight of Muslim
women on the political
agenda, as well as address
problems of integration
and adoption of Dutch
values amongst immi-
grant communities. Many
of her colleagues thought
she was exaggerating
or over-sensationalising
these problems.
In response to this,
Hirsi Ali approached the
minister of justice, Piet
Donner, to register how
many honour killings
took place in Holland
each year. He agreed to
a ‘pilot project’ where
they examined two (out
of a possible twenty-five)
police regions. Between
October 2004 and May
2005, in just those two
regions, eleven Muslim
girls were killed by
their families. That was
more than one a month.
Parliament was shocked.
For these girls, just being
seen with a boy, espe-
cially a Dutch boy, was
a death sentence. Now,
honour-related homicides
in Holland are registered
as such.
A common running
thread in Infidel is the
power of belief. Hirsi
Ali was brought up a
devout Muslim, wearing
full-body Islamic dress at
school, and describes in
great detail her slow and
arduous personal journey
in leaving Islam. She
made the journey moving
from the world of faith
to the world of reason,
from religious dogma to
Enlightenment values,
from the world of forced
excision and marriage
to the world of sexual
freedom. She writes in
the epilogue to Infidel:
“Having made that
journey, I know that one
of those worlds is simply
better than the other.”
She is a fascinating,
brilliant woman, and is
now a true hero cham-
pioning women’s rights,
human rights, and liberal
values. She founded The
AHA Foundation in 2007,
which aims to protect
women and girls in the
U.S. from harmful Islamic
cultural practices such as
female genital mutilation,
honour violence, and
forced marriage.
Despite her hugely
positive influence on the
world, some Westerners
still refuse to listen to
her views on Islam, and
Muslims around the world
have called for multiple
fatwas on her head. Fears
for her life reached a
startling reality following
her collaboration with the
Dutch filmmaker Theo
van Gogh, and his subse-
quent murder in 2004.
