Let's get to know eachother
I
want to use this
week's Editorial to
get a few things clear;
I think it's time you
got to know me a little bit.
Firstly, I want to heap
some praise on my prede-
cessor, Fred Fyles. Fred S
Fyles did an incredible job
with the paper last year.
Some say that his middle
name is, in fact, Superman
(though I wouldn't be sur-
prised if his middle name
were actually Felix). Due
to Fred's hard work, my
job has been made a great
deal easier and I can't
thank him enough for that.
However, despite my best
efforts to copy his methods
verbatim and follow every
step in the Felix Bible that
he entrusted to me during
handover, I am not Fred.
That is why I am hastily
writing this editorial at
10.30pm on a Thursday
night, with the impending
print deadline looming
ever closer. I suffer from
a toxic combination of
severe procrastination
syndrome, complete lack
of organisational skill and
crippling laziness. I feel
it's best to let everyone
know that now, so as to
manage expectations.
I'd like to congratulate
everyoneontheFelixteam
for a fantastic freshers
issue! As I tweeted last
week, I firmly believe this
is going to be the waviest
year of Felix yet. If this
week's front (album)
cover isn't evidence of
just how wavy the paper
is going to be this year,
I don't know how else to
convince you. Last week
we made an excellent start
and I'd like to take this
time to thank every single
member of the team. From
the Section Editors to the
Copy Editors and Head
Photographer, you're all a
pleasure to work with and
I'm looking forward to a
top year! Special shout-
outs go out to:
Copy Editor extroad-
inaire, Rhidian Thomas,
for holding it down for the
Copy Editing team.
Head Photographer,
Joe O'Connell-Danes, for
protecting Felix's modesty
in the centrefold.
Music Editor, Adrian
LaMoury, for spending
more time in the Felix
office than me.
Music Editor and $wag
officer, Simran Kukran,
for accompanying me
in distributing the paper
around every fresher
halls and for curating the
banging #DistributionDay
playlist.
Ireallyenjoyedmeeting
so many fresh faces at
Freshers' Fair on Tuesday.
Our stall was, without
doubt, the funkiest at
the fair and I'm looking
forward to welcoming
some of the 98 signees
into the Felix family.
October marks the start
of Black History Month
and, included in the News
this week, is a story about
the campaign Imperial is
launching in celebration
of Black History Month.
A digital exhibition show-
casing the profiles and
achievements of black
staff, students and alumni
of Imperial will take over
screens across Imperial's
campuses. I think this is
an important gesture and
I'm excited to see the
exhibition once it is in
full effect and learn from
the stories of some of the
different people at this
university.

“A pull quote
in an editorial?
Damn, you
must be
desperate”
If I'm to be perfectly
honest with you, I still
don't really know how to
write an Editorial. But I
think I've rambled long
enough now. If you're still
reading this, it's too late.
