Venture Capital & Startups in Southeast Asia
INVESTMENT

A
s venture
capital eco-
systems go,
Silicon Valley,
Europe and China can
be considered mature
VC economies. Hence
it makes sense for a VC
firm to proceed to more
underdeveloped, under-
served markets to unearth
and polish hidden gems
that may, given time and
guidance grow into the
next Facebook or Uber.
Southeast Asia, or more
specifically the ASEAN
region is one of these
regions. Demographics
is a key reason this small
region might soon be
more attractive to invest
in than others. With a
growing population of
644.1 million, with 70%
under the age of 40, a
large workforce and
consumer base remains
to be harnessed (We are
Social, 2017). The region
is poised to leapfrog even
China in terms of tech
adoption, with internet
users making up 53%
of the Southeast Asian
population. Southeast
Asia is projected to be the
fastest growing internet
market, rivalled only by
India. This is fueling a
booming e-commerce
sector which has pro-
duced at least 2 unicorns,
namely the Lazada Group
and Tokiopedia, both of
which were subject to
investments of more than
$1 billion by the Alibaba
Group.
Geography might also
contribute to the rise of
SEA’sstartupscene.Being
in proximity to key trade
routes and key Asian fi-
nancial centers, the region
is a prime destination for
technology giants and
internet players. Investors
have already poured
mouthwatering amounts
of cash into the region’s
most promising startups
across a diverse range of
verticals, from logistics
to gaming. With the trade
war ongoing, some firms
have opted to relocate
production to Southeast
Asia (Bloomberg, 2018),
which will boost local
economies and stimulate
growth. These efforts are
yielding fruit, notably in
the form of 10 unicorns,
with most based in Indo-
nesia, the region’s largest
market. This might be a
small number compared
to its counterparts in
larger economies, but
the potential for growth
is large. VC funds in the
region, especially early
stage funds are facing
increasingly stiff compe-
tition. Big players such
as Sequoia Capital have
made venture investments
into the region, facing off
against smaller regional
funds (TechCrunch,
2018).
The future is bright for
Southeast Asia. However,
some challenges remain,
such as the lack of unified
regulations and fragment-
ed markets, with diverse
consumer patterns taking
hold in different nations.
Potential political insta-
bility might also spook
investors, but with many
parts of the world facing
similar upheavals it might
be a risk investors are
willing to take.
Despite the ongoing trade war tensions in Asia, there is large growth potential for startups as venture capital
firms eye up the region.
