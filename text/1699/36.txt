L
ast week
marked the
annual descent
of the Freshers.
The freshers have well
and truly arrived and are
making their presence
felt. One keen fresher
was even spotted having
a set of professional pho-
tographs taken with their
Family in Central Library.
After moving into
their new halls over the
weekend, the freshers
took to the streets of South
Kensington, looking super
cool with their shiny new
lanyards draped around
their necks, not too dis-
similar to an emblazoned
scarlet letter.
Imperial’s Freshers’
Fair took place on
Tuesday. Freshers, it is the
one day in the academic
year that anybody on
campus will be happy to
see you and actually wants
to talk to you... make the
most of it. A weird man
wearing a Felix cat head
was spotted dancing and
beckoning freshers over
to his stall in a dark corner
of the Beit quad. His
current whereabouts are
unknown.
Wednesday was a
momentous day - it was
the first Sports Night of
the year! Freshers got a
taste of where they will
be regretting wasting
their Wednesday nights
for the forseeable future.
Negafelix actually came
out to Sports Night, for
puely journalistic pur-
poses. Also in attendance
was the former Deputy
President (Finance &
Services), sharking away.
Freshers beware! Clearly
the world of graduate
unemployment didn’t
stand a chance in keeping
him away from Metric for
a night. This was almost
a surreal glimpse into the
future for all Imperial
students.
