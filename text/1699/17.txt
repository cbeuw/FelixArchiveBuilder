Volkswagen – you are one SaaSy car!

(VW) has
r e c e n t l y
signed a deal
with Microsoft to use
their Azure cloud-based
system. This gives them
the portal to the highly
sought after world of
Software as a Service
(SaaS).
“The Volkswagen
Automotive cloud will
be built from the ground
up on top of Microsoft’s
Azure cloud and IoT Edge
platform as its technology
foundation,” Microsoft
representative said in a
statement.
“We envision the au-
tomobile evolving into a
central hub in the Internet
of Things, enabling cus-
tomers to take their world
into their vehicles,” Heiko
Huettel, chief of VW’s
connected car division
said.
One weakness of car
manufacturers is that they
aren’t effective at devel-
oping software interfaces.
Now, through Microsoft,
VW will have access
to Power BI, a business
analytics service where
users can create reports/
dashboards without
the help of IT staff and
database administrators,
Bing mapping, Windows
10 UI expertise, Skype
and Teams connectivity.
This will help VW kill
two birds with one stone:
cars will be connected to
the cloud and it provides
the consumer-friendly
interfaces and feedback
needed to stay ahead of
its competitors. With
regards to its competitors,
it is believed by many that
Amazon will eventually
enter into the automobile
industry in some way
(distributor, leaser, etc.).
It would be a formidable
competitor, due to its
prominence in the cloud
and AI field, despite its
lack of expertise in engi-
neering. This deal fortifies
VW’s position in the
automobile industry early
in the game.
The deal will also be
hugely beneficial for Mi-
crosoft. In the IT world,
whoever dominates the
cloud dominates the
computing field. Amazon,
with its successful
Amazon Web Services
platform, has pushed the
IT company to the number
one position. Microsoft,
under Sathya Nadella’s
(CEO) leadership, has
taken the role of being
the world’s second largest
cloud provider due to the
recently increased focus
on the cloud. Now, the
billion dollar deal to be
the global cloud partner
for the world’s largest
automobile company by
sales has made their com-
petitors at Amazon, IBM
and Google sit up and
take notice. The cherry
on the cake is that the
deal has been signed right
when VW is undergoing
transformations to enter
the SaaS world..
This partnership con-
solidates VW’s place in
the automobile industry
and also adds a ‘halo
effect’on Microsoft as the
software giant searches
for other global manufac-
turing partners.
