A
m e r i c a n
Animals, di-
rected by Bart
Layton, is about
the real-life story of 4
young adults, Spencer
(Barry Keoghan), Warren
(Evan Peters), Eric (Jared
Abrahamson) and Chas
(Blake Jenner) who
decided to steal several
books of extremly high
value, including The Birds
of America and On the
Origin of Species, from
the library at Transylvania
University.
Director Bart Layton,
a frequenter of docu-
mentaries, decided to
intersperse the story with
footage of interviews with
the real perpetrators of the
heist and other involved
people. This rather unor-
thodox direction proves
to be one of the film’s
most thought-provoking
aspects.
However, before that,
here is everything else
that worked for the film.
The acting across the
four main stars, Keoghan,
Peters, Abrahamson and
Jenner, are uniformly
powerful, particularly
during the explosive
third act where we get
to observe the might of
Murphy’s law playing in
real-time. Despite a rather
slow start, I was on the
edge of my seat for the
entiretyofthesecond-half,
and very majorly due to
the intense performances
from the actors. Evan
Peters especially made
me finally appreciate his
range, as I mostly knew
him as the semi-comic
relief role of Quicksilver
in two previous X-Men
films. The amount of
horror and desperation he
conveyed was astounding
and truly affecting.

“...what the
filmmaker
decides to
include (or
exclude)
directly
influences
how viewers
view, and
learn from, an
event”
The film starts with a
very noticeable statement:
This is not based on a true
story, this is a true story.
This statement is not
one that can be thrown
around lightly, because it
implies that the film has
taken no creative licenses
and is essentially - true.
However, from the get-go,
the film contradicts itself
on this statement already
by introducing unreliable
narratives. And so, the
accuracyoftheadaptation,
and even the authenticity
of the interviews, come
under question.
Intentionally or not,
this film becomes a kind
of commentary on the
process of adaptation
itself. This is important
because adaptations, and
films in general, can be
very manipulative. Simple
changes of the original
material (event, book
etc.) can already convey a
wildly different message.
The original story of
Mulan was never about
female empowerment,
it was about patriotism
and filial piety. So, what
the filmmaker decides
to include (or exclude)
directly influences how
viewers view, and learn
from, an event. Not all
films have an agenda, but
all films are subjective.
And we, as relatively
passive recipients of said
subjectivity, must choose
for ourselves what to take
in, and what not to.

hand, the protagonists
are portrayed as very
sympathetic. Their desire
to escape their mundane
(college) lives and their
eventual regret, seem to
be an attempt to justify
the heist. However, the
film also showed the
protagonists intention-
ally harming Betty Jean
Gooch, the librarian, in an
intense sequence. Should
we therefore condemn the
four perpetrators of the
heist for their immorality,
or should we instead sym-
pathize with their regret
and their ability to grow
as human beings (they
soundedveryapologeticin
the interviews)? American
Animals leaves this open
for contemplation. Having
said that, I feel like the
film tends to suggest the
latter. When the mournful

The aforementioned
documentary method used
by director Bart Layton
is strikingly refreshing.
Having the real-life
people involved in the
heist to express them-
selves directly in the film
was a great, albeit a little
bit lazy, way of letting the
audience sympathise with
them very quickly. It also
allows the audience to un-
derstand the psychology
and reasons behind their
actions (and reactions)
in the most direct way.
Simultaneously, this
blending of documentary
and film also leaves a lot
of questions hanging after
the credits are rolled.

leaves this quite open for
interpretation. On the one
regret in a poignant finale,
it becomes really, really
difficult to dislike the
four protagonists, even
after witnessing them
traumatize an innocent
middle-aged librarian
and jeopardize invaluable
artifacts.
