Demands for Safer Roads after Fatal
Collision in Bangladesh
The killing of two children by a bus driver that lost control of his vehicle has sparked a wave of
protests that reveals the general malaise against the current government.

T
he death on the
29th July of two
school children,
Diya Khanam
Mim and Abdul Karim
Rajib, after being run
over by a speeding bus,
sparked mass protests
in Bangladesh’s capital,
Dhaka. According to
witnesses, the bus was
racing with another bus
to pick up passengers,
before the driver lost con-
trol. A further 12 school
children were also injured
as a result of the collision.
This tragic accident
prompted students across
Dhaka to protest for safer
roads, in a country where
more than 3,000 lives are
lost per year in road traffic
accidents.
The student protestors
brought the capital to
a standstill over the
duration of a week,
creating checkpoints
to inspect the driving
licenses of motorists
and ensuring vehicles
were in a roadworthy
condition. Those who
were unable to produce
a valid license or car
registrations were
handed over to the
police. The Bangladeshi
government, intolerant
of the protests, ordered
the students to cease
their demonstrations.
Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina did not release
an official statement
but advised students
to stop protesting and
go back home, lest a
‘third party’ should
sabotage the protests.
Her warnings remained
futile as students were
determined not to back
down.
On the 4th August,
the peaceful crowds
of students chanting
“We want justice”
were met with violence
from the police, who
employed tear gas and
rubber bullets to injure
over 100 youths. It
was also reported that
pro-government activ-
ists attacked the pupils
whilst demonstrating;
although road transport
minister Obaidul Quader
rejected claims that the
attackers had any affili-
ation with the governing
Awami League Party.
Police also denied
firing rubber bullets
on the students despite
local hospitals having
treated more than 115
students that day, many
with injuries consistent
with rubber bullets.
Local journalists who
attempted to film the
scene were beaten up by
members of the ‘Bang-
ladesh Chhatra League’
- a student organisa-
tion linked to Awami
League who opposed
the protests. Reports of
sexual assault and rape
against young female
protestors also surfaced,
but further investigation
into these claims were
prevented by police.
Angered students
created a charter of
9 demands that they
wanted the authorities
to meet. One of them
included exercising
capital punishment for
those found guilty of ir-
responsible driving. The
construction of a foot
overbridge or another
alternative at the site
of the accident was
requested as a means
of ensuring students’
safety. Moreover, basic
regulations such as
preventing buses from
taking excess passengers
on board were also men-
tioned in the list. Sheikh
Shafi, a student who had
lost his brother in a road
traffic accident in 2015,
said among the causes
also mentioned was the
underpayment of bus
drivers, which forced
them to work long hours
and therefore could con-
tribute towards reckless
driving. Student protes-
tor Al Miran speaking to
AFP news agency said,
“We won’t leave the
roads until our demands
are met. We want safe
roads and safe drivers.”
To censor the
attacks on social media,
authorities responded
by blocking internet
access for 24 hours,
and severely limiting
local Wi-Fi connections
to unusable speeds.
Over the next few
by “larger” factors
than road safety, and
involved “the looting of
the banks, the gagging
of the media, the ex-
trajudicial killings,
disappearings, bribery
and corruption” that
had plagued Bangladesh
under the current gov-
ernment. Other analysts
also believe that the
mass protests reflected
deeper frustration at
an increasingly unac-
countable government
operating under Hasina.
Alam informed the
court that he had been
tortured whilst in police
custody, but on the order
of the Supreme Court,
he was taken to hospital
on the morning of 8th
August; his remand
halted. However, he
was returned to police
custody at 2pm the same
day.
Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina claimed the riots
had been instigated
by her political rival
Khaleda Zia; leader of
the Bangladesh National
Party and former prime
minister of Bangladesh.
Hasina accused Zia
of spreading unrest
as a means of inciting
public anger towards
the Awami League party
ahead of the general
elections in December.
Zia denies the allega-
tions. On the 6th August,
in an attempt to address
the demands of students,
The Road Transport Act
2018 was approved at a
cabinet meeting, which
proposed capital pun-
ishment for intentional
killing using a motor
vehicle, and 5 years of
prison for accidental
killing.

days, dozens of student
protestors were arrested
by police and detained,
but no legal action was
taken against those who
attacked the students. A
‘cyber-hunt’ was also
carried out by police
officers to search for
the profiles of anyone
who allegedly spread
“rumours” about the
attacks online on social
media, throughout the
protests.
Amidst the unrest,
prominent human
rights activist and pho-
tographer, Dr Shahidul
Alam, was arrested and
remanded by police for
7 days, following an
interview he had given
to news broadcaster Al
Jazeera. In the afore-
mentioned interview,
he disclosed that the
protests were driven
