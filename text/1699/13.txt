n recent years, con-
servation has shifted
towards increasingly
sophisticated in-
ternational policies that
recognize the importance
of equity and the rights
of indigenous and local
people. Despite this,
communities within
immediate proximity to
biodiversity hotspots con-
tinue to suffer the most
from ecosystem changes
and profit little econom-
ically from the natural
resources being exploited.
Whilst volunteering
with the Institute of Inves-
tigations of the Peruvian
Amazon (IIAP), I was
able to recognize the re-
curring disregard for these
communities and their
territories by the state,
apparent in the traces of
conflict, narcotrafficking
and cultural erosion. Thus,
it became evident that
planning the protection of
wildlife should not only
consider natural spaces,
but the people who occupy
them, and offer fair and
sustainable schemes to
support their development
in ways which reinforce
the management of the
species.
Why protect at all?
For many, the most
compelling argument
for conservation is that
humanity itself depends
on ecosystems, for food,
soils and medicines, and
the regulation of climate,
water quality, diseases,
flooding, and waste.
But to many indigenous
communities these spaces
represent more. In the
Amazonian cosmovision,
the relationship of a com-
munity with its territory
(not “land”) is conceived
in terms of a collective
right which recognizes
interdependence with
nature.
In recent years, these
same communities have
come together forming
organizations in defence
of indigenous rights.
During late August of
this year, a convention for
indigenous groups took
place in Iquitos, Peru,
where leaders discussed
their place as self-con-
scious actors in modern
day problems - especially
as observers of rainforest
destruction. The event
highlighted the awareness
and desire for cooperation
with the goal of protecting
the natural world.
At the same time, the
Amazonian population
has faced invasion and
imposition from extrac-
tive industries. According
to RAISG, between
2003 and 2013 oil and
gas industry concessions
increased across the
Peruvian Amazon from
15% to over 80%, and over
66% of this area overlaps
with indigenous territo-
ries. In 2005, Argentinian
multinational PlusPetrol
discarded over 1.1 million
barrels of toxic waste into
four rivers in the Northern
Peru, which coincidently
pass through the ancestral
lands of the Anchuar,
Quechua, Kichwa and
Kukama Kikamiria
communities, affecting
their health and having a
devastating impact on fish
and other animals vital for
their livelihood.
Forestry in Peru con-
tinues to be a principal
cause of degradation
and new legislation has
failed to minimize the
impact, instead driving
concession holders to
extract wood illegally
from protected areas and
advancing conservation
projects. The knowledge
of local hunters who fre-
quently travel the region
may be paramount in the
approximation of popu-
lation sizes of threatened
species and at the same
time, education on threats
and the importance of
wildlife to the ecosystem
and the community’s own
future may prompt them
to partake in its protection.
Another exemplary
project by the IIAP cur-
rently underway is the
management of hunted
ungulates, such as the
collared peccary (Pecari
tajacu) and the white
lipped peccary (Tayassu
pecari), both species in
decline in the Peruvian
Amazon. These are used
by communities for sub-
sistence and commercial
sale. The objective of the
project is to monitor the
population through the
hunter’s data, implement
quotas and remove inter-
mediaries who purchase
the meat from the hunters
at a minimal price and
sell it for much more,
therefore allowing the
community to benefit
significantly more.
As these cases high-
light, there are critical
social aspects to conser-
vation and ignoring them
can lead to restrictions
in a project’s success.
Tackling the real causes
of biodiversity decline
is a tremendous task and
one which may only be
achieved through con-
sciousness and coopera-
tion.

indigenous territories and
blank it with legal shares
to avoid detection. This
activity is pernicious to
wildlife, especially to
endemic species sensi-
tive to slight population
changes. It has also led
to conflict; communities
who have denounced
illegal logging activities
have been subject to death
threats and even murders.
Some successful con-
servation models have
emerged and may serve as
examples for the future.
Frequently, these involve
the incentivisation of
wildlife management
through the generation of
local social and economic
benefits. For example, in
early 2000s a manage-
ment project in Guyana
began training local fish-
ermen to survey Arapaima
(Arapaima gigas) popula-
tions – a large and highly
prized freshwater fish. It
was clear that action was
needed as populations
were dwindling and close
to a local extinction. The
project created fishermen
groups, implemented
a harvesting ban and
introduced aquarium
fish cultivations as an
alternative livelihood. In
addition, they led several
community education and
awareness campaigns.
Technical reports from
the following years
demonstrated an increase
in Arapaima populations,
with the fishermen stating
that their main motiva-
tions included a change
in attitude, availability of
alternate fish and a desire
to access future benefits
through the project.
Education and informa-
tion exchange are crucial
in gaining the support of
local communities and
