else.

mperial College
London descended
into a state of
delerious panic as
its student newspaper,
Felix, screwed up its
first crossword puzzle
of the year.
Chaos ensued as
Imperial staff and students
were left in need of a new
raison d’être. Negafelix
has it on good authority
that Andy Djaba, the Felix
editor, was inundated with
angry messages from
outraged readers and
even received some death
threats.
One such complaint
read as follows: “Hi!
Someone must have
already told you, but
there’s a problem with the
crossword this week?”.
How very astute of you,
Sherlock!
Another reader con-
tacted Felix saying, “Hi!
Felix! There seems to be
a mistake with this week’s
crossword... By mistake I
mean that the clues don’t
actually correspond with
the actual grid. Very sad
start to the term.” Sad
reacts only.

with a polite “fuck off!”

Pandemonium ensues as Felix gets its first Crossword
puzzle of the year horribly wrong
This week you’re pissed
at the new Freshers
descending on the
common room like the
plague. They’ve even
taken your spot in the
corner! Time to exert
your dominance!
You decide to relive your
Fresher’s experience
by going to one of the
Union’s Fresher events.
Funny, your entire final
year course had the same
thought, and yet not a
Fresher in sight.
This week you take
solace in the fact that
if even your dancing
skills are better than the
Prime Minister’s, maybe
you’ll turn out somewhat
successful.
This week, you
experience an
unexplainable rush as
you write your lit review
9 hours before the
deadline. Time to Google
‘masochism’.
This week you try going
skating in Hyde Park. Too
bad you’re uncoordinated
because you end up
crashing into a cyclist
and nearly running over a
tourist’s child. Maybe try
bowling?
This week you’ve
decided against renewing
your Skydiving Society
membership – dodging
the taxis on Exhibition
Road is enough of an
extreme sport for you.
This week, in your
attempt at multitasking,
you accidentally send
your lab report to
Goldman Sachs instead
of your finance CV. No
spring week for you this
year.
This week you try to take
the initiative and book
your Counselling session
for early March. Might as
well be prepared for the
annual breakdown.
You treat yourself to the
Black History Month
menu in the QTR. The
jerk rice leaves much to
be desired.
Remember how you
swore to attend every
lecture this year? Please
explain how this week
you’re already 5 hours
behind on your course.
Looks like Panopto and
chill is back on this year.
This week that nostalgic
feeling of being back in
London leaves in record
time as you find yourself
yet again at the back of
the Fusion queue.

as if the
Crossword
isn’t printed
weekly...”
