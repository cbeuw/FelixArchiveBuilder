Students call on big business to get its act together to
build a more equal society

Social Enterprise UK announces the launch of a student campaign petitioning big businesses to work with their future workforce in building a better
way of doing business

S
tudents across the
UK are mobilis-
ing to urge their
potential future
employers to do more to
ensure that they play their
part in reducing inequal-
ity and building a fairer
world. They are calling on
the leaders of the FTSE
350 (combining the FTSE
100 and FTSE 250) to
learn from, support and
buy from social enterpris-
es which are showing how
we can achieve equality
through business.
This comes after it was
announced that recent
research by Bloomberg
found, between 2007 and
2017, black male gradu-
ates earned £7000 less per
year than their white peers
on average, despite being
more likely to invest in
higher education. Black
male participation in
higher education has
increased by 24%, com-
pared with a 15% rise
for white men. Research
conducted by the Centre
for Crime and Justice
Studies suggests that, re-
gardless of gender, black
graduates are less likely
to be employed after grad-
uation. This could be due
to inequalities in higher
education; black people
are far less likely to
receive a good degree and
much more likely to go to
less prestigious universi-
ties, which are both key
barriers to finding a well-
paid graduate job.
The government
brought in the Race
Relations Act in 1965 in
order to protect ethnic
less than half of young
people believe businesses
behave ethically and
that there is scepticism
towards businesses com-
mitment to diversity and
inclusivity.
people are looking for
more from their employ-
ers. They know that busi-
ness as usual is not good
enough if we’re to address
the real and immediate
challenges we are facing
from the urgent need to
decarbonise our economy
to the inequalities of
wealth and power which
are denying so many
people the chance to par-
ticipate in the economy.
Social enterprises are
businesses which have di-
versity and ethics at their
core. They are set up to
trade for a social purpose
and reinvest the major-
ity of their profits back
towards meeting their
social or environmental
mission. They are more
representative of society
as a whole than main-
stream businesses with
41% being led by women
and 12% by people from
an ethnic minority back-
ground – double the level
in the rest of the private
sector. They are creating
jobs and opportunities in
the areas that need them
most.
“Social enterprises
point to what the future
can look like – combining
innovation and profitabil-
ity with a real dedication
to both people and planet.
They are creating a more
equal society through
business and companies
have a lot to learn from
them if they are to attract
the workforce of the
future.”
From coffee companies
providing employment for
the homeless and fashion
labels committed to
supported local producers
to community energy
projects and staff owned
health services - social
enterprises are showing us
a different way of doing
business.
This action forms part
of the broader Social
Saturday campaign organ-
ised by the membership
body for the sector Social
Enterprise UK with the
support of the Co-op
and the Department for
Digital, Culture, Media
and Sport.

minorities from racial dis-
crimination. Despite the
act since being strength-
ened numerous times,
there is regular evidence
that employers continue
to discriminate, on the
basis of foreign-sounding
names, for example.
Much wider shifts in
society are necessary to
ensure equality for all.
This campaign could
be the first step in making
such a shift. The petition
has gone out calling on
big business to take its
obligations to society and
the environment more
seriously at a time when
trust in corporations is at
an all-time low. Research
conducted as part of the
Deloitte Millenial Ati-
tudes Survey shows that
