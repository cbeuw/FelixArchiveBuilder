The Secret Tory: A Behind the Scenes Look
at the Annual Tory Conference
A revealing look into the oddities of the 2018 Conservative Party Conference
POLITICS
I
will be frank – I
am an undecided
voter. I wanted to
make an informed
decision so I did the sane
thing – I bought a media
pass and packed my
bags for the International
Conference Centre
(ICC) in Birmingham.
The Conference was
enlightening… it certainly
changed my perspective
of the Conservative Party.
You can broadly split
us up into three main
categories: Conserva-
tives, press and exhib-
itors. Each type had a
different colour on their
badge to indicate their
separate status – mine
had a beautiful yellow
streak. There is mixing
between all three groups,
but press members are
definitely considered
separate to the others.
At the ICC, all you
need to do is make
eye contact and talk
to someone. There are
so many people and so
many sessions that you
can connect with people
over anything. It’s the
LinkedIn Premium
User’s wet dream. You
don’t need to be equals
in age or status – you get
the opportunity to rub
shoulders with CEOs,
ministers and some of
the highest in society.
There is so much in-
teraction that it makes
you want to crash with
exhaustion at the end of
each day.
The conference
doesn’t end at 5pm. Oh,
no. Don’t look at what
the formal agenda says.
Events on the fringes of
the conference last until
10pm on some nights.
You may meet some
people at these events,
and you may get on with
them very well. They
may invite you for a
drink. The night spreads
out beyond the confer-
ence centre – every pub
and restaurant in the
near vicinity is taken
over for drinks. But this
is definitely less so the
case if you’re ‘press’.
Or maybe I just didn’t
know the right people?
How do you find
someone with your same
interests? And, most im-
portantly, how can you
be dancing with young
Tories on the dance-
floor? The answers lie
in the Fringe events.
The Fringe is where
you go to get the
juicy gossip and fiery
speeches. What you
see on television is a
lie – the power of the
conference is in the
Fringe, not the min-
isterial speeches with
pre-planned material.
The Fringe gives you a
chance to interact with
MPs, industry experts
and CEOs on a one-to-
one basis. The Fringe
also provides the best
seminars. You can ask
questions on anything
and they will answer
you directly. You also
get access to those
populist politicians,
those without a cabinet
position but hold a lot of
sway in the party. In the
fringe Jacob Rees-Mogg
is a sell-out name. The
queue for the Brexit-
central rally which he
starred in spans four
floors of the building
fifteen minutes before
the start. The Fringe is
where Boris Johnson
delivered his leadership
pitch to both press and
members on the hall
floor.
But here’s the interest-
ing thing – most fringe
events are sponsored,
to raise specific topics
rather than for organic
conversation. Event
sponsors include the
Huffington Post, Atos,
Nationwide, the Royal
College of Midwives –
the list goes on. Some of
these sponsors also have
exhibits as well, so you
can’t escape from them.
Exhibitors are dif-
ferent to sponsors. In
the centre of the ICC,
there are a collection of
exhibition stands. Each
of them has goodies to
entice you in. Think
of Freshers’ Fair on
steroids. Let’s take a
step back and consider
the names of some
exhibitors this year:
AECOM (currently
expanding Waterloo
station), Airbus (CEO
complained that gov-
ernment doesn’t know
how to run Brexit),
Drax (taking over Scot-
tishPower, had image
problems from a Channel
4 documentary), Google
(tax avoidance issues),
the list goes on. It is
obvious that these ex-
hibitors have concerns
with the government’s
policies. Meanwhile,
conference space is
expensive. To get access
to these stands, you
needed at least £5000.
That was just for the
small exhibits; larger
stalls required £12,000
upwards.
So why go to all this
effort? Lobbying. You
chat with important
people and you hope
to keep your company
and your desire in the
conversation. All the
exhibitors want to sway
the common perception.
For example, consider
Blackpool – a seaside
resort in the north-west
of England which has
built a questionable
reputation for itself over
the past few years due to
degeneration. Blackpool
last held the Conserva-
tive Conference in 2009.
After this, the town was
barred from holding the
conference as there were
no suitable venues to
host a conference of that
size. This was a massive
blow for tourism in the
town. So, Blackpool
changed. Nine years
later, and Blackpool has
completely revamped
its image. It has a
new town hall, will be
building a new IMAX
cinema by 2020 and
has just completed it
work on its £25 million
conference centre at
Winter Gardens. After
making these changes,
people in the council
bought an exhibition
stand at the 2018 con-
ference so they could
show their regeneration
to the country. And did
it work? According to
one of the exhibitors,
onlookers wanted to
return to Blackpool with
many signing a petition
to return the conference
to Blackpool next year.
So, place your bets now.
That was just some of
what I learnt during my
time there. I learned way
too much to cram into
this piece. All I know is
that this Conference will
be one that stays with
me for the rest of my
life. And if it is held in
Blackpool next year, I
will go and visit – after
all, Blackpool has a
fantastic Wetherspoons
on the Promenade.
