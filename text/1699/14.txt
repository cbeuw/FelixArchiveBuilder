Cull this rampant enthusiasm
Comment writer, Grumpy Bastard, wants everyone to be less enthusiastic. It makes them
angry.

back to
Imperial, I
hope you’ve
had a lovely summer
and that you’re totally
prepared for the year that
lies ahead. However well
prepared you think you
are now, you definitely
aren’t. There will come
a time at some point this
year when you experience
that feeling as your brain
exits through your arse.
I hope you’re looking
forward to it.
I was at the Fresher’s
fair this week and I was
unfortunate enough to
witness a large amount of
this enthusiasm first hand.
The freshers were wan-
dering between the stands
withalookofbemusement
as they shuffled in groups,
clutching at the various
brochures that people had
forced upon them. The
people that stood behind
the stands either waited
with hopeful expressions
as no one went up to talk
to them (I’m looking
at you, sci-fi), fielded
questions with a desperate
approximation of interest
stamped on their face.
The number of people that
came up to stands they
were interested in just
to brag about their past
achievements was almost
unfunny.
for as much free shit as
I could legitimately get
my hands on, I wandered
past Labour soc and their
not-quite-anti-Semitic
idol made cardboard. I’ve
always wanted to draw a
cock on Jeremy Corbyn,
so thank you for that. One
unfunny joke that I’ve
heard the self-satisfied
labour party members
tittering to one another
about is that they are now
the most right-wing party
at Imperial. I thought that
Imperial was politically
apathetic enough not to be
infected by this Trot, Sta-
linist, anarchist bullshit,
but as usual, my very low
expectations of people are
never quite low enough. I
was going into the main
entrance, and two clear
nutjobs approached me,
foaming at the mouth
with socialist vigour, both
crazily waving leaflets
at me. I was able to pass
by, whispering Peterson
psalms 1:12 to protect
my soul and escaped
into the crush of freshers
desperately making their
way to the investment and
business society stands.
I really mean a crush as
well, Metric had nothing
on this.
In all honesty, I’m quite
sad that the Tory party
has disappeared now, as
it means that even the
semblance of meaningful
political debate has now
gone. I mean, it wasn’t as
if the brain-dead fuckers
ever really said or did
anything in the public
space, but clearly, enough
people vote for them in the
real world to at least exist
at uni level. Please don’t
leave us with the rabid en-
thusiasm of Imperial Left
Forum as they bite anyone
that claims that Stalin
was a remotely genocidal
maniac. It’s almost like
we’ve successfully slain
a political horcrux, but
now that it’s dead, who is
there to unite us in hatred?
I guess I will just have
to satisfy myself with
watching the turd slinging
between Left Forum and
the Labour societies.
Worst comes to worst, I’ll
just have to become the
only vocal right-winger at
Imperial.
