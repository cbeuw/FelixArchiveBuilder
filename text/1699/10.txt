Yemen: The big kids’ playground
What the war in Yemen is really about: international superpowers making a statement about
who is stronger. Yemen is the battle arena, and its citizens, collateral damage.

A
s of March
2018 the death
toll in Yemen
has surpassed
40,000 casualties. Save
The Children reports that
at least 50,000 children
have died in 2017 alone,
and to this day and
counting the amount of
displaced refugees is well
over 2 million.
The civil war in
Yemen has been raging
on since 2015, and
while it’s importance
and coverage in the
mainstream media has
been steadily decreasing,
the casualties have been
exponentially increasing
as the humanitarian crisis
becomes more severe and
deadly.
The situation, as in
many countries in the
Middle East, is quite
complex and is a result of
many unresolved issues
escalating to a what now
seems like an unsolvable
conflict. Yemen up until
the 90s was split into
two different countries,
North Yemen: Yemen
Arab Republic (YAR) and
South Yemen: People’s
Democratic Republic of
Yemen (PDRY).
Northern Yemen
was federated with
E g y p t a n d S y r i a i n
the United Arab
States until they
proclaimed their
independence and a civil
war broke out between the
royalist forces supported
by Jordan and Saudi
Arabia and the republican
forces, supported by
Egypt. By 1968 most
opposing leaders had
reconciled and by 1970
the YAR was finally
recognised by Saudi
Arabia and the Egyptian
troops withdrew.
The former Southern
Yemen was under British
rule until 1965. In the
two years following that,
the Marxist National
Liberation Front (NLF)
and the Front for the
Liberation of Occupied
South Yemen (FLOSY)
organised themselves
to leave the British
controlled Federation of
South Arabia. By 1967 the
federation collapsed and
the People’s Democratic
Republic of Yemen was
proclaimed in 1970.
The divide was clear,
whilst the YAR was
supported by Saudi
Arabia, the PDRY was
an ally of the Soviet
Union. As the situations
settled internally in
each newly proclaimed
country, internationally
their relations became
more strained. In the
early 70s they were
openly confrontational.
The road to unification
was not simple, but in
1988 both parties agreed
to demilitarise their
border and in 1990 the
first drafts for a unified
constitution began. These
were ultimately approved
by a referendum and the
president of the YAR
became the president of
the new republic, and the
president of the PDRY
was named vice president.
Peace did not last long
in the newly formed
country due to the poor
economic conditions and
in the unrest of the civil
population,civilwarbroke
out. Salih, the president of
the republic, won the civil
war and in the aftermath,
he appointed those who
had been loyal to him
throughout the war into
power. He also eliminated
freedoms such as
universal suffrage. Other
consequences of the war
were the devaluing of the
riyal, theYemeni currency,
the cost of fuel doubled,
water and electricity were
in short supply, and food
costs rose.
It was the public
discontent in 2011,
prompted by other
uprisings during the Arab
Spring, that led to mass
protests. In 2014 civil war
broke out again, as the
Houthis seized the capital
in demands of lower fuel
prices and a new, reformed
government. Houthis are
Shiite rebels that have
been supported by Iran.
Fighting against them are
the Hadis, the faction that
supported the president
Abd Rabbu Mansour
Hadi of the government
that was forced to resign
by the Houthis. They are
Sunnis, and are supported
by SaudiArabia, a country
of Sunni majority.
Already from the 70s
there was a clear divide
from the Soviet allied
Shiite south, and the
Saudi allied Sunni north.
and Saudi Arabia is
taking place. Saudi Arabia
neighbours Yemen and
shares a vast border with
them, and many Yemeni
citizens cross it to seek
work in Saudi Arabia.
In 2003 Saudi Arabia
began its construction
of a physical barrier that
was even compared to
that between Israel and
Palestine. Their reasoning
was to prevent terrorist
infiltrations but its
construction inflamed the
Yemeni government, that
argued it was a violation
of human rights and the
2000 Jeddah border treaty,
that allowed Yemeni
shepherds for grazing
rights at the border.
Interestingly enough, after
the Saudi led intervention
in Yemen in 2015, the
former country began
removing the border with
its neighbour.
However, like many
conflicts in the Middle
East, although many
point to the cause being
religious, the disputes are
mainly political. Whilst
Houthis were indeed
founded as a Zaydi Shiaa
revivalist movement,
their claims had little to
do with religion, as it was
the demand to have the
fuel subsidies restored
that initially made Houthi
supporters take to the
streets as a sign of protest.
Ultimately Yemen has
become the battlefield
where Saudi Arabia has
concentrated its efforts
to ensure that the rest of
the world know that they
won’t let their neighbours
become allies or affiliated
with their declared
enemy Iran. And since
it seems that whoever is
openly at conflict with
Iran will immediately

Despite the efforts to
build a lasting union,
little was done to ensure
the conditions for the
civil society were fit to
warrant the development
necessary to solidify
said union. No country
will remain stable if its
citizens do not have basic
needs met, and that was
the first failing point of
Yemen. Adding to that
the sectarian and political
divisions, the chances of
peace are even lower, and
the final and perhaps the
most important factor are
the external key players’
interests.
The war that is currently
taking place in Yemen is
the materialised reflection
of where currently the
