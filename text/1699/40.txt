O
n the 30th
of June, 12
members of
the Imperial
College Sailing Club
met at Gatwick’s
Wetherspoons before
beginning the voyage to
Corfu, Greece.
Upon a late night
arrival at the marina,
they carb loaded with
the infamous Greek dish,
gyros, and headed into
town to join their training
partners from the Univer-
sity of London (ULU),
with whom they spent the
week sailing.
The next morning,
after Ariane responsibly
stocked up the 50-foot
yacht with food and (more
importantly) drinks for
the week, they set sail for
a far-away beach club.
Each day, the crew
avoided the mundane task
of washing up by cooking
instead (the culinary high-
lights including Calvin’s
souvlaki, and Oliver
“The next day
they named
the duck
Hoisin. The
rest is history.”
and Charlie’s freshly
caught crab). Such exotic
cuisines placed them way
ahead of ULU who stuck
to the standard grub after
weekly trainings: pasta
and tomato sauce.
However, the friendly
rivalry between the clubs,
usually demonstrated at
the annual BUSA com-
petitions reached new
heights when the club set
their eyes on ULU’s £50
inflatable duck.
A cunning plan to
kidnap the duck was
devised by Aidan (demon-
strating noteworthy com-
modore characteristics)
and Nick. They decided
to hold Toby as hostage
on the duck’s boat as a
method of distraction for
its crew. In the mean-
while, they paddled it to
the boat and later rescued
Toby in a tender. The next
day they named the duck
Hoisin. The rest is history.
Over the course of a
week, they sailed to Iggy
Creek, Lakka, Gaios,
Parga and Plataria and
spent the nights explor-
ing the local bars and
clubs. In between islands
they stopped to swim
and snorkel, sipped on
ouzo (blending with the
locals) and enjoyed nau-
tical-themed music such
as ‘Reggae Shark’, which
was heavily endorsed by
Rory, Nick and Aidan.
One morning at 6am,
Toby sailed the team to
the stunning Emerald Bay.
In an attempt to top the
previous day’s crab catch,
some of the crew tried
spear fishing with a rod
and a kitchen knife tied
to the end, whilst Radhika
found the tranquillity of
the bay perfect to recover
from a bad hangover.
Suddenly, schools of
fish came rushing towards
us, and the spear-fishers
were ready to go in for
the kill, but Fraser and
Charlie soon realised that
the schools’ arrival coin-
cided with the hangover
victim’s tactical chunder
having been flushed into
the sea. Certain that these
fish would not be as appe-
tising as they had hoped,
the mission was aborted.
Their final stop was
Plataria. After a tiresome
week of skippering around
Greece and being held
hostage at the expense of
an inflatable duck, Toby
went for a much deserved
relaxing swim, but was
tragically stung by a jel-
lyfish.
Thankfully they had
medic freshers Lily,
Charlie and Oliver on
board, who assured him
that “peeing on it probably
won’t work” and Calvin’s
second year of medical
school knowledge led him
to the conclusion that a tea
tree oil ointment was the
best solution (which was
surprisingly effective).
Rejuvenated by the
natural treatment, Toby
stole all of ULU’s flags
and hoisted another one of
their inflatables, a golden
swan, onto their mast.
On the last morning,
they headed back to Corfu
and stopped on the way
to refuel, where Fraser’s
docking manoeuvre
(drift) impressed even the
head of the boat charter
company.
Sadly, they had to part
without Hoisin the Duck.
It was a well-deserved
holiday made memorable
with great company, and
the club cannot wait for
more adventures in the
year ahead.
The club are very
excited to welcome new
members and would love
to introduce more people
to sailing!
You can follow the
Sailing Club on social
media and attend one of
their fresher’s events to
get involved.
