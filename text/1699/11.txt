Is misogyny a hate crime?
Yenushi Hiri argues that misogyny is an all pervasive hate crime

Stop being

getting married? When
are you going to have

clock is ticking! What
do you mean, you don’t
want children? That’s
unnatural. Do you know
how pretty you’d be if you
just used some makeup,
wore dresses, lost those
extra pounds and let your
hair down? What you’re
wearing is so provocative!
You’re asking for it! Find
yourself a man who’s
older, taller and earns
more money than you
or else the marriage will
never work.
“Surely you can you
cook?” What a ridiculous
question! Why would you
ask a woman that? Just
because she’s a woman?
Why won’t you ask a
man?
Aman can drink, smoke
and be sexually active and
that doesn’t make him any
less of a man? Somehow
that’s something a man
would not apologise
for. But if a woman suc-
cumbed to the very same,
vitriol and profanities are
hurled her way. Men are-
allowed to get angry and
they are passionate and
firm. Women get angry
and they are emotional
and hysterical.
Is it because of the
culture’s insistence on
subservience for every
woman?
When some men
support their wives
and their daughters and
perhaps in some com-
munities those men are
shunned by their peers
and motives questioned,
“what are you doing?
You’re upsetting a norm
that’s been comfortable
for us.” Just because
treating women that way
has been customary and
practiced for eons doesn’t
necessarily mean it’s
veracious.
Derived from the
Greek, misogyny means
“woman-hater.” It’s not a
difficult term to explain,
but, like sexism and
feminism, a lot of people
refuse to acknowledge
that it exists and a lot of
others don’t comprehend
how women all over the
globe have to pay a price
for just being who they
are. How to tell whether
you’re a misogynist or
dealing with one? The use
of the word ‘female’ as a
noun rather than an adjec-
tive objectifies women as
things instead of beings.
(“These females are
always complaining...”
or “stop acting like a
female”) If a man rolls
his eyes, laughs, scoffs or
raises his eyebrows, all
of which are derogatory
and condescending, when
you express important
opinions, ideas or feelings,
then he’s a misogynist.
Upon hearing that a
woman or girl has been
sexually abused or as-
saulted, if the first three
questions are “What was
she wearing?”, “What
was she doing there?”,
and “Well, what did she
think would happen?”
that person is a misogy-
nist. Women are told they
asked for it, or that it’s
their fault. It’s because
of this ostracism that it’s
not easy for a woman to
come out and say I was
troubled or I was hurt.
Women survive but why
should they? It shouldn’t
be a world where women
survive. It should be one
where women thrive.
It’s not that women
can’t take a joke. It’s that
misogyny is a hate crime
and it isn’t funny.
garner the U.S’s support,
it is unsurprising to see
how invested the U.S
has become on the “war
on terror” in Yemen,
ultimately costing even
more civilian lives than
terrorist ones. In the words
of senator Chris Murphy
answering to the U.S’s
responsibility in the death
of civilians and human
rights violations due to
the interventions: “I think
that there is a U.S. imprint
on every civilian death
inside Yemen. I believe
that because the bombing
Yemen it’s people’s lives.
5.2 million children are
now at risk of famine as
food and fuel prices soar
across the country. This
number is only going to
increase.
With a political
backdrop of war, terrorism
and lack of democracy
in the Middle East, many
superpowers are recently
adopting an approach of
isolationism regarding
their international
policy strategies, whilst
at the very same time
participating shamelessly
in conflicts that do not
affect their citizens’ lives
in the same way they affect
those of the countries
being intervened in.
Countries such as Yemen
are becoming the fighting
arena for said superpowers
to move their chess pieces
and show the world who’s
the most powerful of them
all. But at what cost?
Are Yemeni lives merely
collateral damage?
Would we tolerate these
interventions if they
were causing so many
deaths and refugees in a
first world country? But
perhaps the most pressing
question of them all is:
how far does the damage
have to go for us to react?
“I think there
is a U.S imprint
on every
civilian death

Murphy”
campaign that has been
absolutely catastrophic in
the scope of the casualties
it’s caused is made
possible because of the
United States. We have
sold the Saudi coalition
the bombs that end up
being dropped inside
Yemen. We put planes
in the air to refuel their
fighter jets. We sit inside
their targeting centre to
help them pick the places
that they bomb. And we
provide moral authority.
We are a member of this
coalition”.
The morality of these
repeated interventions
becomes more and
more questionable, and
although the Yemeni
Houthis have reportedly
used child soldiers
and resorted to forced
evacuations as part of their
military tactics according
to Human Rights Watch,
Saudi Arabia’s and the
U.S’s constant air strikes,
interventions and their
prevention of civilians
accessing aid is costing
“5.2 million
children are
now at risk of
famine”
