the way, let us revisit his iconic Acid Rap mixtape
theme of the song. From
Vic Mensa and Chance
writing their verses while
on shrooms, to the beat
being produced after the
vocals were recorded
over an alternative beat,
to somehow landing a
Twista feature, the song
is testament to what an
atypical project this is both
in vision and creation. We
are drawn in by a gospel
organ but before long, its
divine connotation is jux-
taposed and then buried
by dirty, bouncing, New-
York-style drums that
spells corrupted exuber-
ant. All the while, playful
synth embellishments and
soothing, atmospheric
wails accentuate the bars,
a contracting-relaxing
piano chord progression
gluing it all together.
Chance paints us his
delinquent childhood with
a lexicon of references,
Vic acknowledges the
stupid pride to be found
in intoxication (“Got
me feeling like Lauryn
Hill”), Twista scorches
the track with a typical
confident, fast flow, whilst
lending veteran wisdom
to the topic at hand and
managingtorhyme“Higgs
Boson” and “Voltron”.
Following ‘Juice’, the
project’s simple yet addic-
tive single with a call and
response hook, we get the
bitter sweet ‘Lost’. The
first of many exceptional
collaborations between
Chano and Noname,
the song is an ode to
troubled relationships
stuck in a cycle of drugs,
lust, depression and
debilitating dependence.
‘Everybody’s Something’
is a track that sees Chance
and Saba reflecting on
various topics – morality,
religion, drug abuse, de-
pression, police brutality,
blackness, luck and time
– all through a disillu-
sioned Chicago-born lens.
Though this introspection
can leave one feeling
hollow, Chance reminds
us not to lose our self-
worth: “Everybody’s
somebody’s everything”.
Following this sentiment,
Chance raps a list of
similes articulating how
love is, in his opinion, the
best possible thing in the
sincere and heart-warm-
ing interlude track ‘That’s
Love’.
The next three tracks
are more light-hearted,
each featuring a non-Chi-
cagoan rapper who is
now a household name
(Childish Gambino,
Action Bronson and Ab-
Soul). The best of these is
‘Favourite Song’, a hilari-
ously silly self-referential
track about why it should
be your favourite song.
Chance starts the song
with some of the cleverest
and catchiest lines of
the project, packed with
alliteration, assonance
and an astounding rhyme
scheme: “Chance, acid
rapper, soccer, hacky
sacker/ Cocky khaki
jacket jacker/ Slap-happy
faggot slapper…”. He
then glides into a carefree,
half-sung, infectious flow,
repeating this formula
in his second verse.
Gambino adds a laid-back
verse with hilariously
relatable commentary on
the reception of a hit song;
from a friend wanting
credit for putting you on,
to jamming to it “in Aber-
crombie when your work
is finished”.
‘Acid Rain’ is arguably
the most essential track
of the project, the well-
earned climax Chance
had been working towards
this whole time. The beat
is comprised of a bassy
snare, desolate strings
and eerie moans. We hear
Chance’s internal mono-
logue as he trips acid in
the rain. He approached
his thoughts with maturity,
and though he acknowl-
edges that he will always
feel unsettled, nostalgic or
anxious on certain issues,
he reached enough con-
clusions within the three
and half minutes to be a
“new man…baptized…
holy…sanctified…born
again”. Amongst conclu-
sions on the troubles and
artificialness of wealth,
and on taking active steps
to replace gang violence
with support for Chica-
go’s youth, Chance spits a
telling line that introspects
on his drug use: “I trip to
make the fall shorter.” He
trips to soften the blow
of his failures, he trips
to prevent himself from
falling too deep into his
pit of demons, he trips to
make his Autumn shorter;
perhaps an indication
of boredom, but more
likely an indication of
the season’s bleakness
following summers of
high crime rates that claim
the lives of his friends
(Rodney died in Septem-
ber). Nevertheless, on
the last two tracks of the
album, each beautifully
produced, Chance reas-
sures us that he’s still the
ebullient kid we met at
the start of the mixtape
and that, despite any
misfortune or evils, he
can still reminisce about
his happiest moment
and know, sincerely, that
“everything’s good”.
Although Acid Rap
would go on to become
what propelled Chance
the Rapper into stardom,
it is clear that its purpose
was more than that. Acid
Rap was for Chicago and
for the youth. It was to
uplift the disillusioned
whilst telling them they’re
not alone. It was for
stoners, church goers, and
lost friends like Rodney.
And it was for hip hop.
Chance’s‘3’cap quickly became an iconic insignia following the release of his third project, Colouring Book // dancingastronaut
