Prime time
Had you recently
visited the maths depart-
ment, you would have felt
like during the World Cup:
students and researchers
engaged in heated dis-
cussions while watching
a 45-minute-long video.
Only instead of a football
game, we followed a
lecture broadcast from
Heidelberg in Germany.
On Monday 24th
September, Sir Michael
Atiyah, the esteemed
Fields Medalist and Abel
Prize winner, announced
that he had proven the
Riemann hypothesis - one
of the biggest unsolved
puzzles in mathematics.
Cracking the problem
posed by the German
mathematician Bernhard
Riemann in 1859 would
be a major breakthrough.
Some important mathe-
matical papers are valid
only under the assumption
that Riemann hypothesis
holds, so if someone
manages to prove it,
“many results that are
believed to be true will be
known to be true,” points
out Ken Ono, a mathema-
tician from Atlanta. Also,
we can apply Riemann’s
idea in cryptography, so
the proof could potential-
ly improve the security of
online credit cards.
Prime numbers, those
integers divisible only
by one and themselves,
serve as building blocks
for larger numbers. 2,
3, 5, 7 and 11 begin this
sequence, but later they
start occurring increas-
ingly less frequent, with
gaps as large as 1550 (the
largest gap found so far)
between two consecutive
primes. Their unpredicta-
ble occurrence has fasci-
nated mathematicians for
centuries. Riemann might
have come closest to un-
derstanding the unpredict-
able occurrence of primes
that had puzzled mathe-
maticians for centuries.
‘Might have’, because
so far his idea remains
a hypothesis; a theorem
lacking a proof - a proof
desired so badly that in
2000 the Clay Mathemat-
ics Institute promised $1
million to anyone who
provided it.
Riemann suggested that
the frequency of prime
numbers is closely related
to an equation involving
an elaborate function: the
Riemann Zeta function.
Powerful computers
allowed us to confirm
the hypothesis for the
first 10 trillion solutions;
more than the number of
galaxies in the observable
universe. However, if
a cheeky solution that
evaded Riemann’s rule
was found in the next
10 trillion, we would
disprove the hypothesis.
share a lot of scepticism
about Atiyah’s attempt.
“The proof just stacks
one impressive claim on
top of another without
any connecting argument
or real substantiation,”
commented John Baez, a
Californian mathematical
physicist. The doubt of
fellow mathematicians
increased after Atyiha’s
presentation at the Hei-
delberg Laureate Forum,
because he focused on the
history and importance of
the Riemann’s hypothesis,
rather than the details of
the proof.
Numerous failed
attempts to prove
Riemann’s hypothesis, its
importance, as well as the
$1 million prize may mean
that Atiyah might have to
wait months or even years
to get his proof verified,
but if this happens, the
already esteemed Atiyah
will become a true legend.

“A solution

Science writer Paulina Rowinska delves into the unpredictable world of prime numbers and describes why an
explanation for their occurence would be such an important breakthrough in mathematics.
Therefore, the proof must
involve much more than
just manual checking.
Many hundreds
have tried and failed.
Did Atiyah really find
the secret to proving
Riemann’s hypothesis? In
other words, is his “simple
proof”, as he describes it,
correct?
