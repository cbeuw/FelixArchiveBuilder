“Gluey synth
notes and a
shuffling drum
immediately
cast a shadow
on everything
and take us in
a completely
different
direction.”
With a new Chance the Rapper project supposedly on
It’s simultaneously becoming increasingly easy and
difficult to ignore Kanye West. Apparently, he’s been
“working on” a new Chance the Rapper album.
What that means or whether it even matters (see the
substandard Ye or elusive Yahndi) is to be seen. Still, let’s
take this as an excuse to revisit Chance’s magnum opus.
“Chance
doesn’t shy
away from
coating the
seemingly
upbeat and
lively moments
with dollops
of melancholic
juxtaposition
too.”
I
n 2016, we witnessed
Chance the Rapper’s
spiritual rebirth as “lil
Chano from 79th” on
the prophetic ‘Ultralight
Beam’; a moment that
would formally introduce
a more sober, sweet as
Sunday Candy, family
man of a gospel-rap-
per-Chano, who the
mainstream would come
to adore following the
release of his debut album
Colouring Book the same
year. However, before
that, there was Chance the
daydreamer stoner, still
wide-eyed and ingenuous
off the success of his debut
mixtape 10 Day inspired
by his ten-day suspension
from high school for being
caught smoking weed.
That mixtape would only
hint at the full potential of
Chance’s artistry that we
would witness the next
year on Acid Rap.
Acid Rap is charismatic,
energetic and hopeful but
self-aware in a somewhat
disarming way. Indeed,
you wouldn’t have hated
the project for coming off
a little naïve. It would’ve
been a small price to pay
for the witty wordplay
and infectious flows that
Chance delivers, and
the way it is wrapped
in animated and often
undeniably playful pro-
duction. Nevertheless, as
well as Chance gets your
head bobbing during his
highs, he makes a point
of walking us through the
nuance and hollowness
of his low moments with
honesty and precision. Of
course, ‘Paranoid’, ‘Lost’
and ‘Acid Rain’ are tracks
that illustrate this clearly,
each a delicate, floating
dollops of melancholic
juxtaposition too. Indeed,
inthiswayChancerealises
his wider vision for this
mixtape – his project
embodies the off kilter and
restless spirit of a routine
drug user. The lows are
bad, but the highs are also
tinted a sunset-purple.
And he’s hopeful and he’s
self-aware but still, you
wonder whether that’s
a mark of him applying
himself or more a result of
viewing his life from the
vantage point of drug-in-
duced dissociation.
The first track, ‘Good
Ass Intro’, introduces this
mind state with a harmon-
ically sung interpolation
of a Kanye deep cut over
theatrical keys: “Even
better than I was the last
time/ I’m good”. Having
come to know the mixtape
well, this opening chorus
strikes me as something
akin to someone forcing
themselves to have a good
trip, trying desperately to
ignore and thus cast away
the anxiety in their gut.
Chance’s opening line is
a tent peg that he attaches
to the mixtape’s title lest
we forget the core of
his disposition despite
all his good humour to
follow: “Rap just make
me anxious, and acid
made me crazy”. The
song continues to grow
into a powerful, layered
ballad with a charged
beat as more instruments
are added, featuring sung
vocals weaving around
the verses and coming to
a climax on the passion-
ate outro. Chance gets
flashy with his flow while
rapping about his carefree
living and misplaced
pride. He continues to ride
this high on the next track,
‘Pusha Man’ – ignorant
and proud, he claims to
be a “Pimp slappin’, toe
taggin’” pusha man. An
intentional metaphor, the
song ‘Paranoid’ is hidden
within this track after
some silence. Gluey synth
notes and a shuffling
drum immediately cast a
shadow on everything and
take us a in a completely
different direction. We’re
taken to Chance’s gloomy,
crime-filled neighbour-
hood in Chicago where
he feels “Trapped in the
middle of the map”, his
cry at the end of his first
verse articulating the
frustration of growing up
in such an environment.
Chance witnessed his best
friend Rodney’s murder at
18. He raps on this song
with an insight and a raw
emotion only someone
who’s been through
something like that could.
Each verse gets more
poignant and vulnerable.
Having set the scene in
the first, he talks about a
hopeless cycle of murder
in the second, inevitable
when “…it’s easier to
find a gun/ Than it is to
find a fucking parking
spot”. Heading into verse
three, he acknowledges
the climate of fear and
paranoia surrounding him
and implores the listener
to do the same for the
sake of empathy. Perhaps
knowing this won’t ulti-
mately change things, he
then recommends saying
goodbye to loved ones
before it’s summer and
praying for a longer spring
because, as he tragically
muses, “everybody’s
dying in the summer”.
‘Cocoa Butter Kisses’
is one of those songs
which is a product of
stars aligning. Clearly,
everyone who played a
hand in its creation had
a strong understanding
of what it means to grow
inclined to youthful vices
and hence sacrifice the in-
nocence your mum once
loved you for – the central
