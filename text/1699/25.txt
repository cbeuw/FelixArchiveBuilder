Take a Mate to the Tate Late
Every Friday and Saturday night the Tate Modern stays open late until 10pm: perfect for a cash-strapped, culture-
lover looking for a chilled night out. Arts Editor Helen tells us how to impress your mates with a whistle-stop tour
of the Tate Modern at night.

S
o you’ve survived
your first week in
London. You’re
probably feeling
a little squeezed for cash,
but just because you’ve
spent all your money on
curly fries doesn’t mean
you can’t still enjoy the
excitement of being in a
capital city. So, if you’re
craving a wallet-friendly
culture-fix, why not head
over to the Tate Modern
this weekend for an
evening of modern art?
Explore the newly
opened Blavatnik
Building, listen to the DJ
as you boogie the night
away on the terrace bar, or
just enjoy a coffee as you
soak up the Southbank
atmosphere. If you’re not
up to much, make your
way to the Turbine Hall to
lie flat on your back and
leave an impression of
your body on the floor.
While you’re in the Bla-
vatnik Building, head to
the Artist Rooms on Level
4 where American artist
Jenny Holzer is exhibiting
her work until July 2019.
Deliberately provocative,
words and statements are
central to Holzer’s work,
with slogans and clichés
scrawled or printed on
“Deliberately
provocative,
words and
statements
are central to
Holzer’s work”
all sorts of objects and
in a variety of media.
Designed to be accessible
to non-artists, the rooms
are perfect to wander
through and just look at
what catches your atten-
tion at that moment. With
everyday objects that
appear ordinary until you
can get close enough to
read the text, and her love
of flickering or electronic
words, something differ-
ent will catch your eye
each time. Look out for
her inflammatory essays
and her ‘instagrammable’
Blue Purple Tilt as you
wander through her
rooms.
Another installation to
look out for is Untitled
by Rudolf Stingel which
invites the viewer to
create their own artwork
on wall covered in orange
carpet. The work chal-
lenges convention, as it is
only complete when the
viewer creates their own
art with it. It’s constantly
changing, with names and
scribbles easily erased
with information and
displays works by a
number of big names in
the art world including
Andy Warhol and pop
artist Roy Lichenstein.
Keep an eye out for a
poster by a group of anon-
ymous American artists
called the Guerilla Girls,
who produced fifty adver-
tising posters highlighting
racial and sexual discrim-
ination in the art world,
and Pablo Picasso’s Bust
of a Woman. Painted in
May 1944 in Paris during
the final months of Nazi
occupation, this portrait,
with its bright colours
and chaotic background,
captures both the fear and
hope Picasso felt at this
complex moment in his
life.
If you love colour, head
down to the Start Display
on Level 2 to see some of
the gallery’s most popular
works. From Maria
Lalic’s History Paintings
to Henri Matisse’s The
Snail, these rooms are
full of colour and of art
that examines colour.
While you’re there, make
sure you find some of
‘the godfather of colour
photography’ William
Eggleston’s works, and
have a look at IKB 79
by one of my favourite
artists Yves Klein. The
distinctive ultramarine
blue painting is one of 194
monochrome paintings
made by the artist in his
trademark colour Interna-
tional Klein Blue. Klein
started painting these
monochromes in 1947,
considering them to allow
him to reject the norm of
representation in painting,
and so achieve creative
freedom.
Finally, before you take
the lift up to Level 10 to
catch a stunning view of
the London skyline, make
sure to visit the critically
acclaimed installation
The Clock by Christian
Marclay. Described as a
‘mesmerising masterpiece
of contemporary art’,
the 24-hour montage
compiles video and tele-
vision footage of clocks
and timepieces edited
together so that they
flow in real time. Is time
relative? Why does time
seem to move differently
at different times in our
lives? Why do we some-
times feel like it’s slipping
away?
Speaking of running
out of time, don’t miss the
chance to view the Turner
Prize 2018 exhibition for
free before 20th October
for under 25s. What are
you waiting for?Take your
mates to the world’s most
popular contemporary
art gallery on a Friday or
Saturday. You know what
they say – time flies when
you’re having fun!
The Tate Modern is
open Sunday to Thursday
10.00–18.00 and Friday
to Saturday 10.00–22.00.

Bust of a Woman, by Pablo Picasso // Tate
“The work
challenges
convention,
as it is only
complete
when the
viewer creates
their own art
with it.”
“With its
bright colours
and chaotic
background,
Bust of a
Woman
captures the
fear and hope
Picasso felt at
this complex
moment in his
life”
with the brush of a hand,
leaving you with both a
feeling of autonomy and
sense of impermanence.
While you’re on Level
4, make your way over to
