tock markets rise
and rise up until
the point the bull
jumps out of
the window. US stock
markets have been more
expensive than now only
twice in history: Black
Tuesday of 1929, and the
Dot Com bubble of 2000.
Needless to say, both of
those bubbles burst in
spectacular fashion, and
nothing helps to inflate
a bubble like cheap-as-
chips federal reserve
dollar bills. What do I
mean by an expensive
stock market? The gold
standard for investors in
terms of measuring the
value of a company is the
price to earnings ratio, and
this is simply the market
capitalisation (number of
shares x price) divided by
the profits of the company.
And the cyclically adjust-
ed profit to earnings ratio
of the S&P500 (the value
of the 500 largest compa-
nies in the US) is now (at
the time of writing) over
32.9, double the 140-year
mean of 16.6.
As I write this, the US
stock market has just
broken the record for the
longest bull run in the
post-war era. The start of
this bull run was in the
aftermath of the 2008 fi-
nancial crisis, subsequent-
ly to which some may
remember our govern-
ments throwing taxpayer
money at failing banks.
Now, it is not just taxpayer
money that has fuelled the
rise of the stock market.
In an attempt to quickly
cover up the ineptitude of
a cronyistic government
hailed ‘end to boom and
bust’, the central banks
of the world are handing
out money practically for
free. Not to thee and me,
of course; only to the in-
stitutions who have access
to the inter-bank rate. The
ECB famously had its
interest rate at zero for a
while, and even charged
negative interest rates for
depositing. This means
that people and businesses
with high net worth can
use the free money to
invest for themselves.
They create jobs and pros-
perity in the process of
course, but interest rates
cannot remain low forever,
not least because inflation
starts to rise. And recently
we see central banks
around the world raising
rates ever so slightly to
combat this. This will be
the needle that pops the
bubble.
It is not just the ma-
nipulation of money’s
value by the independant
(read ‘unelected’) central
banks that will send the
stocks tumbling… Trump!
Yes, the namesake of the
2016/17 ‘Trump bump’
that sent business confi-
dence soaring with tax and
regulation cuts will cause
the next great depression,
less than two decades
after the last. Why? While
tax and regulation cuts
are generally good for
business in the short and
medium term, a govern-
ment like the US cannot
ceaselessly reduce its tax
take without cutting down
a little on some of the
frivolous expenses like
their huge armed forces,
giant border walls and
hush money to prostitutes.
Ok that last one wasn’t
technically the govern-
ment but I can’t think
of anything else on the
order of walls and guns to
complain about right now.
So yeah, the government
will probably have to shut
down a few more times as
the chaps and chapesses
at the top debate whether
they should continue to
fund their debt problem…
with more debt. And
eventually, both sides will
have to realise it is not
sustainable.And there will
be a levelling. P/E ratios
will tumble back to usual
levels, stocks will crash
and the bear will jump
out of the window. But
one thing won’t change:
the super rich will see this
coming and get out before
you, and lobby for their
central bank friends to
pump out even more cash
to dilute your cash wealth
while inflating their stock
wealth. And we will go
around again and again….
Why we need zoos
Maryna Volyshnya makes the argument for zoos in the modern day
A
s more spe-
cies become
increasingly
e n d a n g e r e d
and face steep decline,
today’s zoos become the
ark, a reservoir of the
world’s valuable animals
during the world-engulf-
ing climatic warmth. As
of 2018 the ZSL London
and Whipsnade Zoos are
a home to almost 23,000
animals across over 800

species.
Many argue that the
quality of life of an animal
is largely reduced when
it is held in captivity.
Althoughthemovementof
an animal in a zoo is more
restricted, a zoo animal
does not suffer or die of a
drought or starvation, with
the zoo providing a varied
high-quality diet. Unlike
an animal in the wild, a
zoo animal is in receipt of
continuous medical atten-
tion, meaning any injuries
or illnesses it acquires
are treated immediately,
sparing the animal pain
and irritation. Socially,
a zoo animal is not
threatened by poachers
or predators and is less
likely to face complete
ostracism, bullying
or infanticide. Highly
specialised animals or
animals which reproduce
more slowly, tend to
evolve in relatively stable
environments which are
highly affected by climate
change, a present-day
problem that we continue
to forecast into the future.
Sadly, now, a zoo is more
capable of providing a
fitting enriched habitat
for these animals than
our own, previously
all-providing, planet, so
characterising a life that is
‘free’as one that is ‘good’,
is a mistake in this case.
If you are worried about
the welfare of animals in
captivity, while bad zoos
should not be overlooked,
your concerns should be
focused more towards the
many breeders, dealers,
farms and private owners
which are in greater need
of inspection and im-
provement.
With most humans
inhabiting urban areas,
a zoo is often the only
place to experience live
animals, as other natural
settings such as national
parks tend to be less ac-
cessible. Zoos educate the
public and foster an appre-
ciation of the animals and
a motivation to protect
them, with zoo visitors
supporting the zoos’ con-
servation work financially
by donating and adopting
animals and through direct
volunteer work. Pro-envi-
ronmental behaviours are
also actively promoted
to the visitors through
movements such as the
ZSL-led #OneLess which
is reducing the number
of London’s plastic water
bottles entering the ocean
and championing a new
refill culture.
As there is no moral
law outside social law,
ethics are part-subjective
so keeping animals under
managed care will always
be an ethical dilemma.
Having said that, during
the era of the Anthro-
pocene, the ultimate
ethical dilemma faced
by humanity is about the
pursuit of a sustainable re-
lationship with our planet.
With strong evidence
existing for the effective-
ness of zoos in saving
animals and increasing
public knowledge and
awareness about the wild,
maybe zoos is how we
reconnect humans to the
ultimate responsibility
and purpose we have
which is caring for our
planet?
