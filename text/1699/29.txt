In the film, a single
veiled actress stands in
the centre of a room, sur-
rounded by four Muslim
women at its corners.
Each of the women have
been subject to different
forms of abuse, and
relevant verses from the
Qu’ran (4:34, 2:222, and
24:2) are painted on their
bodies. After reciting
the ‘Sura Fatiha’ (which
every Muslim is required
to recite first, at every
prayer), the central actress,
rather than bowing down,
raises her head. Through
her, the four Muslim
women’s stories are told.
One woman has been
flogged for falling in love.
Another laments being
forced to submit sexually
to her husband, whom
she was also forced to
marry, for the Qu’ran
says: “When your wives
have purified themselves,
ye may approach them
in any manner, time or
place.” The third woman
is beaten by her husband
at least once a week.
And the final is a young
girl, confined to her own
home, who has been
raped by her uncle. She is
now pregnant and will be
punished for having sex
outside marriage.
By creating the film,
Hirsi Ali wanted to make
it difficult for people to
turn a blind eye to this
problem. She wanted
Westerners to stop
deluding themselves that
Islam is only about peace
and tolerance. She wanted
to illustrate that the pun-
ishment and oppression
of women is mandated in
the Qu’ran, and it is not
simply a gendered issue.
The Qu’ran legitimises
culpable males’ actions
so that they feel no shame
and aren’t challenged by
their conscience or their
community. The strict in-
terpretation of the Qu’ran
causes intolerable misery
for women. All feminists
should be outraged by
this.
I list some clarifying
statements here. First-
off, there is a difference
between Muslims the
people, and Islam the
belief system. It is
nobody’s intention to
demonise a group of
people by pointing out
flaws in the belief system.
A belief system, like any
set of ideas, should be
open to critical inquiry.
Secondly, Muslims are
not one particular race,
and Islam is most certainly
not a race, so its criticism
is by definition not racist.
Thirdly, not all ways
of living are equal, and it
is not bigoted to question
differences between
Western and Islamic
culture that incur undue
suffering, especially
towards women.
However, Western
feminists appear to have
misplaced their priorities,
as have many liberal
elites. Throughout Infidel,
Hirsi Ali makes it clear
that various specific tenets
of Islam are antithetical to
modern civil society (as
have many others, includ-
ing Sam Harris, Douglas
Murray, and Christopher
Hitchens, for example).
But anyone who states
this fact, however well-in-
tentioned, is often swiftly
met with accusations of
racism and bigotry. This
is not a helpful response
if we wish to make
progress on this issue.
It is, apparently, now
of more importance for
Westerners to hide behind
a shallow pretence of
tolerance, than it is to look
honestly at this real clash
of cultures. Tolerance is

They had created a
short, 10-minute, artistic
film titled Submission:
Part One. There was
never a part two. The film
was about the relation
between the individual
and Allah. In Islam, this
relationship is one of
total submission (indeed,
‘submission’ is one of the
possible translations of
the Arabic word ‘Islam’).
Worship of Allah requires
unquestioning obedience
to the rules as declared in
the Qu’ran. With the film,
Hirsi Ali wanted to shift
this attitude more towards
having a dialogue with
Allah.

a virtue, but it needs to
work both ways.
We need more people
to be able to think and
speak clearly about these
topics, and not have to
fear for their lives in
doing so. Hirsi Ali herself
still lives with round-the-
clock protection. No-one
should have to do this for
speaking their mind. The
issues inherent in Islam
should not be untoucha-
ble.
I think everyone
can and should benefit
from reading Infidel.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s story
is moving, riveting, and
consciousness-enhancing.
She writes with heart,
wit, intent, and a great
perspicacity of the most
important and compelling
social issues of our time.
