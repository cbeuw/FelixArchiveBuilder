about the wider left-wing
movement. A panel dis-
cussion on the American
Left with Julia Salazar
(New York state senate
candidate), Bhaskar
Sunkara (editor, Jacobin
magazine and publisher of
Tribune), as well as Alex-
andra Rojas, organiser for
Bernie Sanders’ presiden-
tial campaign, was held at
TWT. A lot of insight was
gained by hearing first
hand from those fighting
for the Democratic Party
to become a left-wing
party, and a true alterna-
tive to the Republicans’
destructive far-right
vision for America. Ever
since the relative success
of Bernie’s presidential
campaign, these activists
have been organising
under the banner of
‘Democratic Socialists of
America’, and have been
celebrating major victo-
ries including the win of
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
earlier this summer.
On the last day, I ended
up at a brunch event with
John McDonnell (the
Shadow Chancellor) who
spoke about what steps
a Labour government
would take once elected -
the first term of the Labour
government will involve
reversing the damage
caused by the Conserva-
tives’ economic agenda,

veterans of the
movement and
those new to
it”

and the second term will
be about working towards
implementing even more
new ideas to radically and
permanently transform
our society so that it works
for all of us, not just those
born with a silver spoon
in their mouth. Environ-
mental policy was also a
key topic of the speech
– McDonnell has spoken
strongly against the ex-
pansion of Heathrow and
was one of the few Labour
MPs to vote against it in
Parliament. During the
talk, I was sat next to a
lecturer from Goldsmiths
University as well as a
young activist from the
midlands. People from
different walks of life
have all been brought
together by this revital-
ised movement, and this
was further solidified by
the Leaders’ Speech that
followed.
In the packed confer-
ence hall, Conference
was called to an end with
a speech from Jeremy
Corbyn. The strapline of
the Conference was “Re-
building Britain – For the
Many, Not the Few”, and
this theme was prevalent
in the speech. It touched
on all the big issues, from
Brexit to Windrush. He
criticised the disastrous
foreign policy of the
Tories, calling on them
to stop arming the Saudi
government that has been
waging war in Yemen.
With Brexit, he announced
that Labour will be voting
down any deal that
negatively affects living
standards and workers’
rights, and will be pushing
for a General Election to
avoid a no-deal Brexit if
the Tories cannot get a
deal through. Labour will
be investing in public
services, reversing the
cuts, and even introduce
a powerful policy that
aims to give workers one
third control over their
company boards – slowly
working our way towards
a socialist economy.
“Being at
Conference
wasn’t just
about the
Labour Party
- it was also
about the
wider left wing
movement”
It was a powerful
speech that has been seen
by many to be one of a
future Prime Minister.
The speech ended a
Conference where a lot
of comradely debate
had taken place and the
mood had lightened after
a difficult summer. Over
a few days, the wide rifts
and divisions between the
left and the right wings
of the party were sown,
with all of us walking
out feeling like there was
a government in waiting
– a government for the
people, by the people.
It was an exciting
experience. I felt like I
was part of a genuine
movement that can win
the debate and transform
our society for the better.
Looking forward, we have
massive change coming
up for Britain: Brexit.
Whatever happens in the
run up to March 29th, the
debate will be incredibly
different this time next
year, and who knows

- maybe Labour Party
Conference 2019 will end
with a Prime Minister’s.
