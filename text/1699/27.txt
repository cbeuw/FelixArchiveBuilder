Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust
MillyThomas’one-womanshowisavisceraltakeonsuicide,depressionandthepeopleleftbehind.It’snowonder
that this Edinburgh Fringe 2017 hit has transferred to London yet again.
H
er sadness
has become
unbearable, so
Alice decides
to end it. She takes her
own life. But this isn’t
where her story ends. We
encounter Alice on the
morgue slab, in her first
moments of ‘death’ as she
realises she is still here, a
ghost, watching her body
and the people she has left
behind. This is the concept
of Dust – a one-woman
play, written and per-
formed by Milly Thomas,
in a stark, stripped back,
bare-bones production
that has transferred to
London following an
award-winning run at
Edinburgh Fringe in 2017.
Alice watches her
family come to see her
in the morgue and, even-
tually, the reverberating
effects of her death on her
parents, brother, boyfriend
and best friend, Ellie. This
is interspersed with key
moments from Alice’s
life: the day she started
contemplating death, the
day Ellie tearfully pleads
with her to move back in
with her parents for her
own good. We’re taken
on a tour of moments that
help us understand the life
Alice was living prior to
death, and how depression
had impacted her. Despite
this, there isn’t an ‘origin
story’ for her depression,
no abuse or trauma that
explains the source of
her problems. This is
one of the best aspects
of the writing in Dust. It
rings true to the reality
of depression as some-
thing often inexplicable.
Thomas keeps the focus
clearly on the effects of
depression, rather than
searching for some elusive
cause.
Alice is witty and
sharp, switching between
funny one-liners and stark
emotional commentary.
She’s frank, talking about
her body, her desires, with
an openness that borders
on the vulgar. It’s clear
that Thomas is as skilled
a writer as she is a per-
“Dust isn’t a
play that wants
you to watch
it, it’s one that
demands you
give yourself
over and
experience it
whole”
former. This doesn’t mean
that Alice is likeable,
though, far from it. At
her funeral her brother
Robbie describes her as
“selfish”, “self-absorbed”,
“the kind of person who
puts empty containers
back in the fridge”. This
is perhaps one of the most
insightful parts of the play
and one where it truly hits
home that Thomas has
drawn from real, lived ex-
periences; the unpleasant
truth is that this is what
mental illness can and will
do – bring out the worst in
someone, the selfish, the
self-obsessed, the destroy-
er of relationships. Alice
is also immature. From
the context it’s clear she’s
a woman in her 20s, with
university well behind.
But her fascination with
sex and her immature
attitude to her boyfriend
seems almost adolescent.
It’s hard to tell if this is a
flaw – the shock value of
a woman obsessed with
sex and bodies, who talks
about it in the frankest of
terms. Or is it a symptom
of Alice’s depression, a
previously vibrant and
sexual woman who is now
incapable of thinking of
bodies in a way that is not
cerebral, dominated by a
morbid fascination with
the most visceral aspects
of human existence.
Thomas’ writing doesn’t
really make this clear and
that’s a pity as it is really
the one thing in Dust that
is occasionally jarring.
Milly Thomas is
fantastic, as Alice and as
everyone around her. She
transitions seamlessly
between characters,
somehow capturing the
individual essence of
each one through tone of
voice or posture. There
are moments when it
becomes confusing and
a little unclear who is
speaking, but surprisingly
this doesn’t detract from
the play. It just makes
the moments and the
characters bleed into each
other in a way that puts us
closer to Alice’s state of
mind. Thomas is a master
of accents and is faultless
as Ellie, Alice’s Scottish
best friend.
The production is
flawless. The intimate
space ofTrafalgar Studios’
Studio Two is perfect for
Dust. The audience are
mere feet from the action
and it all feels so close and
so visceral. This is perfect
for the subject matter, and
for the nature of the play
as a one-woman entity.
You’re so close to the
action that there’s no way
to hide, to step away from
its emotional impact. And
you don’t want to. Dust
isn’t a play that wants you
to watch it, it’s one that
demandsyougiveyourself
over and experience it
whole. Anne Reid’s set is
simple: a stainless steel
morgue table, mirrors, and
Thomas, dressed only in a
bodysuit, her hair pulled
back in a tight ponytail.
It’s hard to overstate
the impact of this pared
down set. It enhances
the intensity of Thomas’
performance, and gives
her the full attention of the
audience.
As Thomas states in
her closing speech to the
audience, we are living
in an epidemic of mental
illness, with suicide, in
particular, impacting
more young people
than ever before. Dust
is both illustration and
commentary of this and
is certainly a must-watch,
and not just for those who
have suffered the effects
of mental illness, or those
eager to help struggling
friends; no, it is essential
viewing in order to grasp
part of our current cultural
climate. An emotional
ride, yes, but one that’s
very much worth taking.
