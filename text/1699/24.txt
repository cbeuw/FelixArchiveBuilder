The Hippo in the room: toxic masculinity
F
ollowing up
a debut LP as
w e l l - r e c e i v e d
and enjoyable as
Landmark was bound to
be a tough job for Hippo
Campus. The American
Midwest’s breeziest
indie rock band have
not shied away from the
pressure though, and have
just released a record
that – despite not being a
big departure from their
previous work – offers
a sound more solemn
and themes even further
grounded in meaningful
stories from the everyday
than before.
After announcing the
album, frontman Jake
Luppen explained that
the album’s overarching
theme – an exploration
of toxic masculinity and
the reasons behind it,
was largely influenced by
the #MeToo movement.
A quick glimpse at the
tracklist, which is, bar
two songs, made up of
one-word titles, gives
a good idea of what
the album is about.
‘Mistakes’, ‘Anxious’,
‘Doubt’ and ‘Bambi’ are
introspective snapshots
of a man trying to find
solid ground in society.
Each song is a confession
full of feeling, all of them
strung together to make an
album that promises hope
for those who can can
relate to Bambi’s story.
The psyche of the
album’s lyrical subject is
one grounded in confu-
sion and insecurity. The
opener, ‘Mistakes’, is a
biblical premonition of
what is to come. “Forbid-
den like a fruit and I’m the
snake / Just a bite, I wanna
know the taste” relates
the mistakes yet to be
divulged throughout the
album to the original sin.
Taking on this mindset,
it feels as though every
slip-up that the character
suffers is a must, a prereq-
uisite for understanding
what is good and what is
right – first you must take
a bite. But the last words
offered up by the excellent
album closer ‘Passenger’
(“If I ever became the
things we lost, the things
we left behind / I would
wish for the past when
we were pure, suffering
intertwined”) suggest
that perhaps the original
sin is not necessary. That
biting into the apple of
being whatever society
deems to constitue a man,
a paradigm which spews
bouts of toxicity from the
repressed feelings it drags
along with, may not be
necessary; maybe Bambi
wishes he could go back
to being pure, living once
again blissfully with his
Eve in the garden of Eden.
While the main idea of
the album rings good, and
many of the songs live up
to it, that is not the case
for all of them. The long
intro (‘Sun Veins’) on
Landmark was one of the
highlights of the album,
and ‘Mistakes’ follows in
its path as a synthier and
hazier cousin. ‘Anxious’
may not be as explosive
as Landmark’s ‘Way It
Goes’, but waiting for
Jake’s godly tenor to
finally spread its wings
halfway through the song
is incredibly rewarding.
The title track is probably
the best song on the album
and key to understanding
it. “I swear to god I wasn’t
born to fight / Maybe
just a little bit, enough to
make me sick of it” is a
great indictment of toxic
masculinity, how a man
can feel forced into a role
of an aggressor due to
external pressures. It must
be said though, that by the
middle of the album some
of the impetus is lost and
too much of the lyrics are
spent on Bambi feeling
sorry for himself due to
fuckups that are now in
the irretrievable past. “I’m
sorry, I’m sorry, I suck, I
suck..” interrupts the false
beginning of ‘Honestly’.
We get it, thank you for
opening up, but your
self-analysis could have
gone deeper, Bambs.
The album is a note-
worthy follow up to their
debut. Compliments
all round for how well
thought out the idea of the
ironically-named Bambi
is, but some of the hooks
sound lazy and the bouncy
drums and Jake’s voice
will not carry this album
through as seemlessly as
the first. A valiant effort
nonetheless.
Fresh albums: Thee Oh Sees, Gregory Alan Isakov
The new Isakov
album is out
today...
And I haven’t listened to
it yet because I’m writing
this piece on a Wednesday.
But it’s spawned enough
singles to be recommended
to me on Spotify anyhow as
an EP, “Dark, Dark, Dark,”
after the lead single on the
album. And boy howdy, isn’t
he dreamy?
Isakov has produced vir-
tually nothing but classics
in his fifteen-year career.
He’s a man of many tal-
ents, from the sparseness on
“Rust-Colored Stones” to
the jangly marches of “This
Empty Northern Hemi-
sphere,” featuring langorous
fiddles and a profound sense
of peace and tranquility.
In between, there’s been
all sorts - splashy piano,
warm bass hums, and glo-
rious noise-walls, distort-
ed, looming, carrying the
melody in the background
while the mandolin in the
foreground holds a pick pat-
tern. For a guy with such a
distinctive sound, he really
goes all over.
These new singles are
pretty great. There’s a hint
of Bon Iver in the falset-
to reprise on “Chemicals”;
“Dark, Dark, Dark” recalls
Old Crow Medicine Show-
style country with a lurching,
cadence, and “Caves” has an
absolutely delightful indie
lo-fi vibe - this vibe gives
way to a delightful climax
with the reprise “Let’s put all
these words away.” The right
notes of wist, melancholy,
and nostalgia are hit.
So, to sum up: Isakov
hasn’t missed before, and
there’s no indication that
he’ll miss this time. Cop the
album.
Thee Oh Sees
goes prog-metal
with Smote
Reverser, claims
Pitchfork. Thee
Oh Sheesh.
First: Wikipedia lists
them as Oh Sees, and Spo-
tify as Thee Oh Sees. Take
your pick, my dudes.
I can’t believe I missed
this album last week. Thee
Oh Sees is an experimental
garage-rock outfit well fa-
miliar to Music Section ad-
herents with a flair for the
grungy and atmospheric.
Their old stuff is very de-
sert/stoner rock; as Pitchfork
says, after the rough patches
they hit in 2013 or so as a
band, John Dwyer took the
chance to reform, and the
new double-drummer en-
semble is definitely distinct
in sound from their older
stuff.
There are lots of great
drum patterns on here, and
lots of nice jams that zig-zag
around in feel with glee.
While it’s true that the’re
generally stepping on the
toes of the prog metal fan-
base a bit more with this
album, this album might
not appreciate people look-
ing for stuff in the vein of
djent or whatever you kids
are calling prog nowadays If
you’re a fan of letting atmos-
pheric rock ride, you’ll like
this album.
I stuck my headphones on
Charlie’s head (shoutout to
the Comment Section) for a
second opinion and he thinks
they sound grand. So cop
this too.
Tim Hecker’s
triumphant
return with
Konoyo.
Tim Hecker is probably
best known for his master-
piece work Harmony in Ul-
traviolet, which has topped
many a list of the best ambi-
ent albums of all time. Oth-
ers might know Ravedeath,
1972; yet another classic.
His palette has shifted
slightly; most of the instru-
mentation on this album
is old-style Japanese stuff,
with the samples recorded
over a week in a Buddhist
temple in Tokyo.
There are harsh starts and
stops, wonderful grating
drones, and an ominous ro-
botic madness to the entire
piece. This is nothing less
than a return to form for one
of the greatest living ambi-
ent artists.
Par for the course, Hecker
builds staggering, spacious
landscapes, allows them to
decay into discordant noise,
and revitalizes them - pull-
ing back out into fresh surg-
es of harmonic peace.
And that, lads, is your
weekly listening.
