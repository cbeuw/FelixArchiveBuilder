TWENTY . FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1995 LETTERS
LETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED T O THIS WEEK BY SIMON BAKER
A bit of
a
Boon
Dear Felix,
There are factual inaccura-
cies that need to be addressed
instantly regarding the "Freddie
Starr ate my grant" article. This
certainly was a good read but was
soured by the presumed views of
the Conservative Party on Higher
Education. At a recent meeting
with the secretary of state for
Social Security I was made aware
of the government's plans. They
are not to eliminate the grant
completely but to make funds
given to students from loans and
grants equal in proportion if they
come from a family that has no
means to fund their living
expenses. Universities are still
being built and a three-fold
increase in student numbers has
been measured in the past six-
teen years, on top of all this the
Government can hardly be
accused of reducing students
numbers as many would like to
believe. Now, the Government
needs to find the money from
somewhere. Raising taxes is out
of the option as the public would
vote them out on their tax
record. I maintain that it sounds
reasonable to ask the future high
earners of tomorrow to pay an
amount, after all it is the super-
market cashiers and bus drivers
that are paying towards our edu-
cation today.
Developing "lower-level"
courses, whatever they are, is a
matter for each institution. The
government will rarely intervene
if courses are felt to have a poor
content, it certainly does not
encourage "low level" courses.
The snippets from the
Labour Party's SBS (Sound Bite
Snippet) Department can be
completely disregarded. I scoff
publicly at the meaninglessness
of "seamless robes of learning"
and "learning bank". Employer
contributions for tuition sounds
like an excellent idea. Industry in
this country is often accused of
not investing in the future.
When I meet the Secretary
of State for Education I shall put
forward ideas given by Consoc
students: these also include a fur-
ther promotion of the semester
system and maybe a set of insti-
tutions that specialise in teaching
graduates only.
The fact is that Higher
Education is facing considerable
reform. A process of slow change
is needed, not radical reform as
suggested by some quarters.
Regards,
Geoff Boon
Vice Chairman of Consoc.
Anoth er
Boon
Orr, Poor Rachel!
Portillo just wasn't nice
enough for you! I'll make sure the
next interviewee will accommo-
date you on their knee and sing
sweet rhymes. Now, I don't need
to tell you this but to get to the
position of Secretary if State for
Defence you need a tough skin. I
would think you'd be terribly
naive to think he was going to be
a warm homely figure.
On a more serious, note, I
had hoped for a more enlighten-
ing account of your interview
with Uncle Mike. There has been
more coverage of his personality
and other side issues than what
he actually said.
Regards,
Geoff Boon
Vice Chairman of Consoc.
What are you saying, G e o f f
Michael Portillo is a warm,
homely figure. Was ever a man
more misunderstood. Honestly,
he's all right, but he does tend to
rub some people up the wrong
way. Most of what you say is
fine, although the huge expan-
sion in higher education has
undoubtedly created some third
rate institutions offering mean-
ingless degrees. Yes, more good
quality universities, but not
renaming glorified technical col-
leges. And a pint to first person
who can tell me what 'seamless
robes of learning' means.
Keep it in
M i n d
Dear Felix,
I was pleased to read your
interesting article "It's all in the
Mind" in last weeks issue. I too
attended Jeffrey Gray's fascinat-
ing lecture, those who are inter-
ested in the consciousness debate
may like to know that there is
work along these lines being done
here at Imperial.
Professor Aleksander, of the
Electrical Engineering depart-
ment has proposed an Artificial
Consciousness Theorem. From
this we are developing a frame-
work to build conscious
machines. Anyone who is inter-
ested can visit our web site:

Fascist
Posters
Dear Felix,
I can understand that posters
pasted to the outside of college
are removed. They make the col-
lege look untidy and there are
notice boards where posters can
be put up. It wasn't, therefore,
surprising that the Socialist
Worker posters, pasted outside
the Physics Department, only
remained there briefly. What
does worry me is that the two
obviously fascist posters have
been on the wall of the Physics
Department for about a month
and only minor attempts have
been made to remove them. If
Imperial College, over a third of
whose students are from over-
seas, tolerates this, I don't think I
am the only one who should be
worried.
