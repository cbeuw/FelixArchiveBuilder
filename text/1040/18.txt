Pan-European
Youth
The Society for European Youth received an
official invitation by the Fontainebleu Youth
Foundation to form a delegation and to
represent IC at the third "Europe 2020"
paneuropean conference, which will take
place in the University of Oxford from
March 16th to 23th 1996. Last year four
people applied and got accepted to the
conference, where they performed superbly.
The conference has been described as "a
podium for the Youth, a chance to take part
in the shaping of policies which will affect
our lives". It will include events for the
participants such as a Careers Fair event with
multi-national companies and also the award
of valuable scholarships to those delegates
whose performance is outstanding.
Some of the leading Universities across
Europe, as well as Oxbridge have confirmed
their continued participation.
The application consists of :
(i) A letter and a personal c.v.
(ii) a supporting note from one's academic
tutor or Dean of Faculty
(iii) an essay of no more 1500 words,
typewritten and in English.
Applicants should discuss one of the
following, having in mind the subheadings
'Hopes, Dangers, Priorities' :
1. The European Union in the 21st Century:
who should make the laws? How should they
be applied?
2. The exclusive use of the European Single
Currency - compatible with national
democracies?
The deadline for receiving applications is
the 15th of December. The essays will be
judged by an academic panel based in
Oxford. If you are interested to know more
about the conference and how to apply,
e-mail Kyriakos Hatzaras (kh@ee.ic.ac.uk).
Don't worry about the subjects: the group
will work together on this to make sure that
everyone produces a good essay.

Another one-off special! Put your musical
thinking caps on for the NME/Coca-Cola
Pop Quiz. If you've not entered a team yet
and want to, there might still be places, see
flyers and posters for details.
If you don't want to enter, the NME is
supplying some entertainment during the
quiz, so you're welcome to just come along
and watch! The quiz starts at 8pm in the
Ents Lounge and entry to the event is free.
We follow the quiz with a visit from
"Common People" - a night of Indie sounds,
peppered with the odd pure pop classic, so
if you're into Brit-pop, baggy or loud
Americans with guitars, then we should have
something for you. 10 until 2, entry £l/free
with Entscard.

Yacht Club
IC Yacht Club have been sailing in the
Solent again. As soon as crews were ready,
each boat locked out of Port Solent marina.
We motored out of Portsmouth harbour,
and once out set sail. Saturday was bright
and sunny, with just enough wind to fill the
spinaker in a long lazy run down the Solent.
We practised some manoeuvres in Cowes
and then headed for Lymington, managing to
find the entrance in the failing light of the
sunset. With the boat swinging at a mooring,
Mario cooked a wonderful pasta meal.
The wind had picked up a bit by the
time we finished eating, and we tacked by
moonlight back to Cowes for the night. We
arrived back in Cowes with just enough time
for a pint and a brief walk before retiring for
the night.
Sunday morning started with the
traditional Yacht club breakfast fry-up, then
We left Cowes Yacht haven as soon as we
had managed to replenish the stores. The
wind had kept up and gave us a chance to do
some practise fog navigation exercises, and
even attempt a bit of a race between the two
cruising boats.
If you are interested in sailing with the
Yacht Club, contact Carlo
c.contaldi@ic.ac.uk, or come to our
meetings on Thursdays.
