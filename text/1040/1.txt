Hope For
Linstead Bar
BY T O M STEVENS
Last week's Linstead Hallowe'en
party disturbances originally pro-
voked the Rector to post an
immediate and indefinite suspen-
sion of Linstead's bar rights.
However, College is now rueing
its hasty action and is planning a
more measured response. The
celebrations got out of control
after a fire alarm expelled drunk
students from the festivities tak-

including worries about the
image of the department and pas-

head when one of the depart-
ment cleaners, who are often pre-
sent on the landing above, suf-
fered a chest infection allegedly
aggrevated by the smoke. The
risk of legal action against the col-
lege in similar cases has been said
to be a major factor in this ban.

leading to most students being
forced to stand outside the
entrance to light up. This option
obviously has problems; firstly,
litter has greatly increased partly
due to the students anger at
being ostracised, secondly the
