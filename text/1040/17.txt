X-country Club
Having read recent reports in Time Out
regarding alcohol consumption at IC we feel
that the cross country team has not met its
expected quota of units per week in recent
years. For this reason we have decided to
introduce an initiation ceremony: drinking a
pint a minute until the initiate chucks. We
challenge other teams to such events, the
scoring consisting of the total number of
pints drunk before chucking. We believe this
will increase club membership and promote
the image of IC as a whole.
Our race last Wednesday went well, IC
men coming 3rd overall, and the women's
team coming 2nd. We think this was due to
the added courage and lack of inhibitions
afforded by fifteen pints and two curries.
Anyone interested in joining the X -
country club should contact t.spicere or
burge@ic.ac.uk.
