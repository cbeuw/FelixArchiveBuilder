Okay. This is it. The scoop you've all been wait-
ing for. Just remember that in a few months, or
maybe even a few years time, when the music
press are wetting themselves over a young
Brummie band and gushing forth phrases like,
"the best band this country has produced for
years"... just remember that you read it here
first.
Now you might just be iftinking, "Calm
down and take a
cold shower,
Vik." Then
again you might
just be nodding
your head sage-
ly and mum-
bling quietly,
"Yep. He's lost
it." But, please,
let's look at the
evidence.
Dissident
Prophet were
signed after only
their second gig when they weren't even a prop-
er band and were still playing for a laugh. Good
start. They've released a single called
'Generation X ' that weaves golden threads of
loud guitars and says more as an observation of
youth culture than most bands will fool them-
selves into thinking they're doing in a lifetime.
Still going strong.
Live, they excel and play like their lives
depended on it, even when faced with a thim-
ble-ful of locals at a pub like The Swan in
Fulham. Andy Jennings is one of a very rare
breed - a vocalist with a supremely melodic voice
that actually sounds purer and more wholesome
on stage than on disc. Tom Livermore is the best
guitarist I've heard in aeons. Loud, soft, aggres-
sive, pensive. You name it, he plays it. Not that
this is some Eric Clapton or Joe Satriani, self-
styled guitar guru whose artistic, musical head
got lost up a rear passage long ago. No, this is
someone with a God-given talent who's using it
to imbue, embellish and deliver the band's music
with soul, gut. feeling and splendour. And then
there's Simon
'Smudge' Smith
and John Large
who could prob-
ably keep a
rhythm going if
they were play-
ing in a band
with a couple of
tone-deaf, musi-
cal heathens.
Which they
aren't, as you
know. Case
almost closed. .
And if you don't care about any of the above
then listen to the songs, all of them necessary and
sufficient for any condition. Witness
'Unconditional love' and truly understand the
meaning of the word beauty. An epic that speaks
the gospel tmth when many around are feeding
us with lies, it builds from an awe-inspired peace
to a climax that wall send shivers up your spine
but leave you feeling warm inside. Truth and
beauty. What more could you need? Verdict: the
best new band in Britain. Case dismissed. (11?)
•album: dubstar -disgrace-
Once in a while, an album come along that dis-
pels all previous perceptions and blurs the sig-
nificance of the boundaries dividing rock, indie
and pop. Even the guitars will not be missed
because the essence of all that we love in music
is there. 'Disgraceful' is an album that captures
music at one of its glorious moments and pro-
vides a great relief from all the pop music blar-
ing from the radios.
It is almost too embarrassing to admit that I
like Dubstar. Sarah Blackwood's voice simply
embraces you with a renewed sense of child-like
optimism. Steve Hillier and Chris Wilkie pro-
vide the musical landscape to complete a world
that pop so often claims to achieve but usually
fails.
Delving into the lyrics, tales of casual sex,
physical violence and possibly even the end of
the world start to emerge. It will probably leave
you humming the phrase, "I'll watch the stars go
out", silly before the meaning of it finally hits
you.
There is a certain depth to Dubstar's songs
that belies their music. If the Manic Street
Preachers are about life at its brutal tmth, and
Drugstore are about the life we live, then
Dubstar are probably about living and embracing
life with a smile. While that may be too nice for
some, it will probably balance out all the pain and
drudgery of life that fills up your average,
respectable C D collection.
'Not manic now' is playing on the air. Listen
and decide. It is simply a lovely record. (7)
