FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1995 . FIVE
Why I love killing small animals"
Like hounds tired of the chase,
the unwashed ranks of saboteurs
have (so far) given up on the
hunts.
Cynically one may draw the
assumption that the higher pro-
file (and thus more profitable in
terms of subscription fees) veal
export demonstrations have left
the mob tired. Hunting is yester-
days news and more importantly,
the bored housewives who so
valiantly joined their more vocal
children would be deterred by
the prospect of leaping out at
horses on a wet Saturday morn-
ing.
The Greenham Common
descendants aren't so clever
though (as evidence see how they
try to stop trucks in the same
way as horses). It is more likely
that the paradoxes, which lie at
the core of single interest issue
groups, have defeated the cause
of the campaigners.
For example, townies com-
plain of clogged B-roads that take
them to work and back, but they
would prefer the countryside
wasn't carved up as a solution.
The yobs that plant themselves in
tree tops and construct complex
underground warrens in order to
preserve the countryside have an
ingrained hatred of the traditions
that enable the countryside to
maintain it's character.
And herein lies the real
problem that has nothing to do
with preservation or conserva-
tion. We have become a Virtual
society and thus incapable of
understanding reality. To the
mediocre urbanites who oppose
hunting, the countryside is a
national park, a mock mediaeval
inn, replete with brass fixtures
and (ironically) copious refer-
ences to hunting. What it most
definitely is not, is a community.
A working environment. A whole
society which revolves around it's
own ancient traditions and bat-
tles to maintain it's economic
health.
For all the wailing and
remonstrations of the dread-
locked herd, foxes must be killed
- they are a pest. If foxes aren't
hunted then they would be shot
or gassed - methods that entail
substantially greater suffering
than being instantly killed by
hounds.
The cocktail and clubbing set
obviously don't see things the
same way. They suffer from
'fluffy animal syndrome' - the
unshakeable belief that all cuddly
looking animals have a right to
live regardless of the severe prob-
lems that not controlling them
can have. They impose their
views on the media unfriendly
country dwellers and make no
attempt to understand their
ways.
What the vociferous oppo-
nents really hate are country
squires and aristocratic layabouts
deriving pleasure from the whole
process. They argue that the ani-
mal suffers great stress from
being chased for miles when it
could be destroyed instantly, but
that misses the point entirely. All
prey animals (including the
lambs and chickens killed by
foxes) are constantly on the alert
for predators. It as they say, in
their genes. Thus their stress is a
natural biological state and not
foreign to them.
The ignorance of the pro-
testers is matched only by their
hypocrisy. Bent double, dirty
faced and all facial appendages
pierced, they almost inspire sym-
pathy. They carry all the evi-
dence of a rough past but scratch
the mud away from their cheeks
and they're as fake as the country
pubs they like to visit. Confused
youngsters carrying the emotion-
al burdens of adolescence and the
middle class politically correct
guilt of their parents, and with a
morality based on the inane mut-
terings of transient heroes that
pepper their dormitory walls.
In a further twist to confuse
the children, parents are now
waking to the realisation that
blood sports and hunting in par-
A 4 :
& A &
ML Mm m,
ticular are not that bad - their
former standard bearer, James
Barrington, the Chief Executive
of the League Against Cruel
Sports recently decided that
hunting was "respectable". His
apostasy follows on the heels of
his predecessor, Richard Course.
The House of Lords declared a
Wild Animals (Protection) Bill as
unworkable and in order to save
it, it was shorn of its anti blood
sports element. A recent Rural
White Paper acknowledged the
role of hunting shooting and fish-
ing in the country.
Even in Africa, the unthink-
able is now a reality - game hunt-
ing is returning. The conservation
policies to support the elephant
have been so successful that
there are too many of them.
Some of them are flown to
national parks. Others are culled
in a cold blooded way.
Elsewhere, the natives weary of
trying to maintain an agricultural
existence with the threat of
thousands of animals eating them
and destroying their crops, have
turned to the market to make a
living. Hunters from America pay
up to five thousand dollars a day
to track wildebeest and shoot
them. The numbers set aside for
hunting are strictly controlled
and in any one area amount to no
more than 0.5% of the popula-
tion.
In Africa, as in the English
countryside, there is a different
set of ethical principles that dic-
tates the treatment of animals
and it is a system based on the
unique experiences and problems
of the region. Hippopotamus
may be majestic and cuddly
beasts but they kill over 300
Africans a year. We are fortunate
in not having to contend with
migrating bison interfering with
our daily lives. The imposition of
one set of (Western) principles
derived from David
Attenborough documentaries,
onto the natives smacks of
Colonial missionary activity and
the charge applies equally to
those who see our own country-
side as an Arcadia devoid of any
harsh reality.
The turning of the tide will
undoubtedly cause hassles for
Mr. Blair, who is committed to a
ban on hunting, not least because
the nations three million anglers
have joined the hunters and now
represent a significant voting
group peddling their own inter-
ests. The formation of the apolit-
ical Countryside Movement by
an American lawyer, Eric
Bettelheim, under the
Chairmanship of Sir David Steel
adds further momentum to the
cause of the rustics.
The country bumpkins have
turned on the pack and the chase
has only just begun. It will be a
bloody and hard fought fight
which will see the end of one
party. You can be sure of one
thing though, death will, regret-
tably, not be instant and painless.
