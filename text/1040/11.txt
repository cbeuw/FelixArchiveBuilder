Just a few of the films still
showing around London....
celluloid guide:
film: crimson tide^
From the stable that brought us Top Gun and
Days ofThunder comes another fast action movie,
but this time it's set underwater.
Gene Hackman is hard-ass Captain Ramsey
of the submarine USS Alabama, while Denzel
Washington is Hunter, Ramsey's cool and level-
headed executive officer. When they receive a
garbled message to launch a tactical nuclear strike,
debate becomes mutiny; Hunter relieves Ramsey
of command and the crew's loyalty is split. The
change of command occurs amid an intense esca-
lation of red alerts, white knuckle developments
and catastrophes.
The script is more entertaining than films nor-
mally associated with this genre but ultimately
fails to create any significant degree of depth,
despite doctoring by Quentin Tarantino. Filled
with the expected testosterone-charged posturing
and adrenaline-pumping sequences, this is
nonetheless one of Tony Scott's best films to date
and one of the few good action movies this year.
film: il postino.pooky
Based loosely on real life events, the film focuses
on the unlikely friendship between the renowned
Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, exiled in Italy, and his
simple stand-in mailman Mario Ruoppolo.
The unworldly Mario lets Neruda introduce
him to the world of poetry and is soon success-
fully seducing the local beauty. This is a film of
characterisation not plot (an unknown phenome-
non in Hollywood), helped by two exquisite per-
formances by the leads.
A charming film in the Cinema Paradiso vein.
film: the usual suspects^
Not many films can claim such a laid back atmos-
phere which lulls the viewer into a false sense of
security right up until the end, when you finally
learn the truth. Some may claim that The Usual
Suspects has that Tarantino feel to it, but this is a
truly original affair (and even has a title relevant to
the film!).
Roger Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey) is one of
the only two survivors of a shipboard massacre,
and as he recounts his story to FBI agent Kujan
(Chazz Palminteri), the story of a Hungarian arch
criminal evolves. This is the same crime boss
whom Agent Kujan is after, but who may or may
not actually exist. Gabriel Byrne also stars as an
ex-cop who reluctantly leads the merry men on
the heist.
The script is well-planned with twists and
oddball occurrences whacked up on the screen
when you least expect them. Fewer guns and
more brains.
film: clueless'spooky
In a similar vein to Heathers but considerably less
satirical and more lightweight, Clueless pokes gen-
de fun at the rich kids of Beverly Hills.
Alicia Silverstone plays Cher who, with her
best friend Dionne, are the resident ultra-popular
glamour queens at Beverly Hills High. Cher is
essentially good-hearted and loves nothing more
than using her position to help others, especially in
making over the 'clueless'. But in the process she
finds that she is clueless herself, particularly in
matters of the heart.
Nothing much really happens but by never
pretending to be more than it is, the film remains
engaging throughout, is often highly amusing and
even has some surprisingly sharp observations.
film: the bridges of
madison county
spooky
The film version of the best-selling novel has Clint
Eastwood as Robert Kincaid, a National
Geographic photographer doing a story on cov-
ered bridges. After asking directions from an
Italian-born housewife, Francesca Johnson (Meryl
Streep), a passionate four day affair begins.
Despite the ubiquitous crickets and corn-
fields, and a disruptive flashback structure
through which Francesca's children discover jour-
nals of the affair after her death, Clint Eastwood
still knows how to direct. Two fine performances
from the leads help avoid the trap of slushy senti-
mentality.
Despite the obvious turn-off of middle-age
love this is still a gentie, tender tale directed with
style.
film: apollo 13magpie
A real life disaster story which puts all those 70s
movies to shame with its energy and excitement,
this is surely one of those films you can't miss.
Apollo 13 is a 'docu-drama' of NASAs third expe-
dition to the moon. When a routine stirring of the
oxygen tanks causes an explosion, the crippled
spacecraft is in danger of never returning home.
Even though the outcome of the film is
known, director Ron Howard is able to maintain
the suspense factor during the events in between.
The best performance comes from Ed Harris
who plays Gene Kranz, the head man at mission
control whose calmness and leadership never fail
the three astronauts.
The largest surprise is that all the spectacular
footage is original to the film - none of this NASA
archive business. Suspense in a tea cup filled to
the brim
