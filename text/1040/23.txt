Ladies Football
Why is it that Imperial
College's most successful football
team is never given a pitch..?
Despite many hurdles, IC Ists
still managed to win yet another
game.
Tasmin, the 'Canadian cap-
tain' ordered her team to get
their "butts on the Tube, and
make thier way to the lands
where the berries grow." This
was achieved despite giving
British Rail passengers a thrill
when we changed on the plat-
form at Wimbledon.
Once on the pitch, the IC
Ladies towered over their oppo-
nents. After an under par first-
half, Kendra the 'American Ace'
capitalized an a slick passing
move. This was followed by a
goal from Eva 'the Norwegian
Daemon'. Barely a minute later,
Julliete 'the Scottish Shooter'
banged one in. Stephanie Moore
who played the field well man-
aged to score.
Despite the rocky beginning
the IC Ladies Ists have won
again.
Mens Football
RSM Ists: Our goalkeeper
touched the ball 5 times during
the the whole match, need we
say more?
Thanks to IC Ists for all
thier help. Goals for the Silky
Scotsman, the still underated
Simon, Digger (who did not fall
over) and the Comeback King
Keith.
RSM 2nds: The vengeful sec-
onds held out against the team
who knocked them out of the
cup. In a game where the rules
did not count for much, only one
of their players went to hospital.
Well done Pete.
Judo
Last Sunday there was a
friendly at Cmabridge between
IC, Cambridge, UCL and ULU.
The competition was close and
fierce with IC winning the Kyu
grade (grases under black belt) 5
man contest (Christophe Carrere
(captain), Jean-Marie Clouet,
Chris Leach, George Tiskouras

and Phil Wood) after points.
The women's competition
was won by the Cambridge A-
team, with the help from IC's
Beatrice Leupin, against
Cambridge B and UCL.
The Dan grade (black belt)
competition was won by the
ULU 5 man team (Hrvoje Jasak
and Steffen Fredersdorf from
IC) narrowly beating Cambridge
and the ULU old- boys team. A
scratch team of lower grades
were no pushover for the Dan
teams, who'll be excellent candi-
dates for the BUSA regionals
later this month.
Netball
IC played an exceptional
first quarter agianst LSE, finish-
ing with a 6-goal lead. We kept it
up duriong the 2nd quarter, lead-
ing 13 - 3 when disater struck!
Play was stopped after Tara
threw herself at the flow and ren-
dered herself imobile for 5 mins.
After establishing nothing was
broken, she hobbled to the side-
line to finish the match spectat-
ing. Ic had a reshuffle and play
recommenced. An oponent was
heard to say "everytime we play,
a member of the oppostie team
gets injured...I wonder why?" So
do we!!
LSE took advantage of IC's
unstable emotioanl state to finish
at half time 13-8.
The 3rd quarter wasn't
much better with everyonme still
mourning the loss of our captain,
and LSE managed to close the
gap to 18 - 13.
Some fighting talk at quarter
time and IC prevented LSE
catching up completing to end
the game 24 - 22.
Cross-Country
The course undulated
through pools of vomit provided
by Holloway's team captain, but
Imperial gritted their teeth and
and dug deep. Everyone ran well
with exceptional results from
child molester (ladies team mem-
ber) and Swiss Cottage (Men's
captain). The remainder of us
mere mortals were headed by
'Leyla/Mr. Incest Man' and
Jurgen. Despite missing the pools
of vomit, Miss X managed to find
dog pooh in the park.
Disappointing results were
provided by Cedd, who was dis-
tracted by Christina's ponytail
and an unfortunate herd of deer.
To conclude the team man-
aged a good turn out ... for the
pub, where cokes were had all
round because Imperial doesn't
drink, of course.
Men's Hockey
A fine example of a match of
two halves, we scored 4 in the
first half, 2 from flipper, 1 from
shaggy and a penalty flick from
plastic man. After a good half,
some absolutely dire play fol-
lowed.
They scored 3 in the second
half, all from Ringers, b******s,
not much else to say about the
match, but we won, they lost,
hah!
Women's Hockey
lst XI: After a 10 - 0 white-
wash lsat year (we won!) we
went out with the intention of
improving our goal difference.
However, we played to our oppo-
sition's standard and not to our
own.
The score at the end of the
first half was 2 - 0. In the second
half, we lifted our game (and the
ball) and regained our usual stan-
dard. Final score 5 - 1 to us (crap
goal by them!) Excellent hat-
trick from the star centre-for-
ward. Many thanks to the 2nds
that turned out. Looks like we
are through to the second round -
for the first time Karen can
remember, and she's REALLY
old!!
Badminton
The assassination attempt of
the captain of LSE's team failed,
never mind...we WON!
Well done the team.
