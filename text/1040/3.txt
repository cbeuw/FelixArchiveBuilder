HEFCE Funding Drops
Fresher
Death
BY M A R K BRIDGE
Anisha Dixit, a First Year
Information Systems Engin-
eering student, died from pneu-
monia at the Royal Brompton
Hospital last Tuesday. Her fam-
ily flew in from India to be with
her just before her condition
detonated and she passed away.
She had been feeling
unwell during the first few
weeks of term and went to stay
with her aunt. However, shortly
after seeing her GP she was
admitted to Kingston General
Hospital, from where she was
transferred to the Royal
Brompton.
A little over a week later she
went into coma. After doctors
explained how speaking to the
comatose might help them,
friends from Tizard, the hall
Anisha lived in, went to see her
and talk to her, sometimes
through the night. Unfort-
unately, Anisha died four days
later.
Anisha came to Imperial
College from Wimbledon High
School, were she was an outgo-
ing student who achieved excel-
lent A level results. She was'
highly spoken of, and many of
her friends, members of staff,
and old school-day friends were
present at her side during her
last few days.
John Hassard, Warden of
Tizard Hall, spoke of her kind
and helpful nature and the deep
sense of loss that was felt for her
at the hall.
Margaret Cunningham, the
Senior Tutor on her course, was
present at her funeral. She relat-
ed how her father sang a beauti-
ful moving rhythmic recitation
in Anisha's memory.
Anisha was cremated, and
her ashes taken to India to be
scattered in the river Ganges,
the great river that is sacred to
Hindus.

The Higher Education Funding
Council for England has recently
announced its final grant alloca-
tions for 1995-6, which see
Imperial College receiving only a
small increase in funding. Though
IC is getting a 0.5% increase in
what HEFCE calls "Transitional
Relief", which will be cut next
year and be reduced to zero the
following year, the actual grant
itself has fallen by 0.7%, which
some believe represents a "drop
in real terms".
Talking to Felix, the Pro-Rector
for Educational Quality,
Prof.Alan Swanson, said that the
drop could be attributed to vari-
ous factors. "They [HEFCE]
have a formula for allocating...
there are quality measures and
volume measures". Quality mea-
sures, he added, are conducted
every four years and an assessed
department then receives a rating
out of 5 for its work, and it is this
rating that is a multiplier for
receiving research money. The
Volume Measure is measured
annually, and IC has in recent
years suffered in areas influenc-
ing this. One factor was the
departure of senior staff for
other institutions, which in
recent years has included Prof.
Patrick Dowling, former head of
Civil Engineering, becoming vice-
chancellor of Surrey University.
Whilst he felt that this in some
ways put Imperial in a good light,
he said, "We have a lot of good
people who are attracted by juici-
er plums elsewhere." Moreover,
he added that some of the "bright
promising younger people" who
have since replaced them would
only perhaps start to show the
same amount of output as their
predecessors in later years, in
areas such as research, in order
for there to be an improvement
in a department's rating. He
went on to say that improve-
ments had been implemented in
order to raise the quality mea-
sure, such as the setting up of
Governor's Lectureships, set up
in response to "departments feel-
ing the pressure of high staff-stu-
dent ratios". About 30 such lec-
tureships have already been given
out and "are already showing
promise". With the various
improvements in mind, Prof.
Swanson was confident that any
funding drops, however minor,
would eventually sort themselves
out. Assessments, he added,
forced departments to re-exam-
ine their strategies and improve,
particularly in areas like research:
"A certain amount of pressure is
good," he said. But he dispelled
suggestions that it was becoming
easier for departments to
improve their ratings as they
came to know more about how
assessment procedures operated,

Ben Turner, I C U Deputy President (1990 - 91), enjoyed proving what great jobs I C graduates can get
as he represented his firm, Andersen Consulting, at the 1995 Career's Fair.

For those looking forward to graduating in the near future, the 1995 Careers Fair offered the chance to
hunt out a suitably fulfilling post for the time to follow. A wide range of companies were invited, although
ome students noted a bias toward Information Technology placements rather than Engineering and Science
programmes. The companies seemed generally impressed with the outstanding quality of the students, and
students likewise were pleased with the companies available to them. Both, however, were united in their
opinion that splitting the venue over more than one room made it impossible to negotiate a quick tour, and
putting time delays on finding a firm made the event more tedious and tiring than it need have been.
