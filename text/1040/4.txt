Teaching Assessments seem to
confirm the belief that a depart-
ment which is strong in research
will also be good at teaching.
"There's a good correlation
between teaching and research...
[which] is nice for us," though
he dismissed suggestions of collu-
sion as teaching and research
assessments are conducted
entirely separately and by differ-
ent groups of people. As for
whether or not he felt that the
teaching assessment was a fair
measure of a department's quali-
ty, he said he had "detected no
feeling that they'd [the assessors]
had made a really bad job of
it...they've got an extremely dif-
ficult job to do in the time they
have to do it." Teaching Ass-
essors are academics who also
have full time jobs as well as hav-
ing to conduct the assessment.
IC's Director of Planning,
Dr. Rodney Eastwood, felt that
any efficiency gains in teaching
tended to be cancelled out by
inflation, so the term "efficiency
gain" was a "a bit of a misnomer".
He added that college's
research funding share was still
very high compared to other uni-
versities. "We have a bigger
research grant than teaching
grant," he said, saying that the
proportion was between 60-40
and 70-30. "Our mix of disci-
plines includes none of the
cheaper ones," he said, citing
Arts and Humanities as exam-
ples. But he stressed that this
funding drop in no way repre-
sented trouble for the college.
"We're financally OK," he said,
"We hope to do as well if not
better as in [the research assess-
ment] 1992."
Improvements, he said, were
being made by raising staff-stu-
dent ratios, and increasing
research output, though he
added that this does increase
pressure on the staff. The next
research assessment, due next
April, could be worth Â£100m
over the years 1997-2001.

The last Times Higher Education
Supplement reported that IC's
1992 ratings for Geology and
Environmental Studies were
both 4 out of 5 for research, with
Geology receiving a teaching
assessment of "Excellent". The
Head of Geology, Prof. Michael
Worthington, was pleased with
the research rating, which was
made in 1992.
On being asked if it indicat-
ed that there was any scope for
improvement, he said, "I entirely
agree...there is room for
improvement...[we will] attempt
to do better." However, the
teaching assessment was "almost
faultless...one could almost get
big-headed except that we
don't." The department has since
taken on six members of acade-
mic staff. "The [research] assess-
ment was made in 1992, and
things obviously move on...the
balance between teaching and
research is difficult to get
right...but we are trying to
achieve that duality. I'm very
happy with teaching though we
need to improve." Prof.
Worthington himself was
Chairman on the national panel
in 1992, and will be again in
1996. This panel assessed all the
Geology departments, and he
described having to leave the
room whenever IC was dis-
cussed.
Assessment, he said, is a
"very serious business" related to
the amount of cash Imperial
receives. "With a four, we get
less money than with a five." But
he did consider to assessment to
be fair, saying that there were
some twelve excellent geology
departments, not all of which
could receive the prestigious 5
rating.
