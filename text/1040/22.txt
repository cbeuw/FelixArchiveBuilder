SPORT FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1 9 9 5 . TWENTY-THREE
Anchored in Whitstable
Yachting
After months of gruelling
physical training, hours of tortu-
ous tactical debate and more
than a years worth of logistical
planning two of the most honed
sailing teams, nay - machines,
that mere mortals have ever laid
eyes upon departed for the first
sailing event of the year.
However no one could have fore-
seen the cunning underhand tac-
tics that the pitiful opposition
were prepared to employ. Little
did our two valiant teams know
that the high energy isotonic
drinks that they thought they
were consuming whilst travelling
wind picked up and racing began.
Both teams put up respectable
early season performances, but
the poor conditions meant that
there was a lot of racing left to be
done on Sunday. Whitstable
yacht club provided an excellent
evening's entertainment on
Saturday, ably assisted by the
event's sponsors:- Shepherd's
Neame Brewery. A number of
team members, determined to
make up for poor performances
on the water, decided to give
their all in the bar. The second
team captain, Paul 'Tarzan'
Roche went beyond the call of
on Friday evening had in fact
been switched for beverages with
an alcoholic content.
Despite the aforementioned
despicable rouse your kindheart-
ed heroes still managed to find
time in their packed itinerary to
assist the University of Kent at
Canterbury with their parking
arrangements, before retiring to
the luxury Hotel laid on by the
host University. Saturday began
hazy and slightly late, with mem-
bers of both teams cursing them-
selves for falling victim to the
opposition's dirty tactics.
After some deliberation the
host club decided to suspend the
commencement of racing due to
the passing hurricane - rumours
that the wind was gusting up to
half a mile an hour were rife.
Tension within the already high-
ly strung teams began to rise.
Finally in the early afternoon the
duty to cement relationships
between IC and the host club.
Paul 'Chunder Blunder' Linford
did likewise.
The races came thick and
fast as the pressure was on to fin-
ish the 50 or so remaining match-
es. Competition was fierce as a
number of races went right to
the line. The first team showed
great boat speed on a number of
occasions, but as the majority of
them were new to team racing
they lost out tactically to more
experienced teams. Protests flew
as the interpretation of the sail-
ing rules became more and more
convoluted, a sure sign that
everyone was trying hard enough!
Once the spray had settled, both
teams had respectable placings.
The first team won 7 races and
lost 4 - placing them 5th overall,
whilst the seconds won 4 and lost
7 - placing them 9th overall.
Squash 4ths
A challenging season lies
ahead for the Imperial College
fourth team following their well
deserved promotion this year
into London Division 2. The
team this season is comprised of
Nick Alsop (captain), Markkv
Ventiainen, Liam Hudson and
Adam Ritz.
The season started poorly as
IC4s were unable in the first
two weeks to field a full strength
team. Last week a full strength
IC4 struggled in their first away
fixture against the disciplined
first team from the medics at
Royal Free Hospital.
The only game achieved was
by Mark at player 2, in a match
characterised by long rallies and
winning boasts. A resounding
return to form is expected this
week in a home match against
the first team from the students
at United Medical and Dental
Schools .
Squash 5ths
The season failed to get off
to a flying start for us as we were
beaten (thrashed?) by the col-
lege of law who are obviously in
the wrong league.
An understrength side trav-
elled to Queen Mary and
Westfield the following week to
pick up a few points, winning
one match out of four. However,
last week Alec, Sarfraz and Ian
the triumphants gave University
College London a mauling with
only Rob the not so triumphant
losing and he was extremely
unlucky and was by far the bet-
ter player.
On Monday we travelled to
St Georges with mixed fortunes.
Ian was the only triumphant
with Sarfraz making a strong
comeback to just lose. Ian and
Rob were sent packing but it
could have been much different
had we been better players. Last
year's promotion has put us up
against tough opposition but we
will soon be back to consistant
winning ways.
This weeks result: St
Georges Medical School
(StGMS) 3, IC 1.
Cross country
This Wednesday the IC X-
C team took part in the 6th
Annual Metropolis subteranean
railway meeting, more common-
ly known as the sewer rats race.
This unique event was first held
through the present day
Northern Line, which was
closed especially for the race.
Runners converged from all over
Briatin for this prestigious event
which was considered second
only to the London
Birmingham 'Rocket Race'. It is
widely recoginised that Roger
Bannister used this rce as a
warm up to his world record
four-minute mile. Previous win-
ners include Sebastian Coe, Said
Aouita and Jennie Rogers.
The increase in commuters
meant that in 1953, closure of
the Northern Line was deemed
too cost in-effective, and since
then, the race has been held
above ground. During this time,
the most famous winners have
been Eric Liddel, Andy Overend
and Cedd Burge. In these
enlightened times, the race has
to be held away from centres of
high traffic concentration, this
year's organisers choosing
Camden Park Road to Seven
Sisters Road. The course is still,
however, reasonably hazardous,
runners having to contend with
irate taxi drivers, irate bus dri-
vers and perhaps worst of all,
hoards of Japanese tourists.
However, we felt safe in the
knowledge that St. Johns
Ambulance Brigade were on
hand. This year's winner, Tom
Spicer, is widely believed to
have been aided by two No. 14
buses, a taxi and extensive
knowledge of the local area. The
unofficial winners were named
as James Tindal Robertson, and
Emily Collins. The joint organis-
ers, Gary Hoare, Gerald Jon-
Johnson and Stephanie Rooke
said that this year's event ran
relatively smoothly, compared
to 1923, when 34 runners were
tragically killed by an errant
Tube train. Reports at the time
of a fanatical anti-fitness cult
were vehemently denied by a
Mr. V.Blobby.
