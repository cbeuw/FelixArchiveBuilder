News in brief
College Rethink
for Hall Bar
Continued from front page
tion. They also pointed out the
high level of noise coming from
the celebrations in Southside.
In response Mr Swanson
admitted that the decision had
been 'arbitrary' and said that
with hindsight he would have
preferred to close the bars of
both Linstead and Southside.
However, he continued that as
the first decision had been
deemed to be rash, he preferred
not to make other decisions
without further consideration.
Further consideration should
take place over the next few days
in the form of a high-level com-
mittee meeting to decide the
College's formal reaction.
The College is keen to devel-
op a policy on such occurrences,
and wants to be seen to be acting
on complaints from local resi-
dents. This is due to the pro-
posed extension for Linstead,

mission pending further discus-
sion. Local residents will be con-
sulted on the new scheme and
their opposition to the develop-
ment would be highly undesir-
able.
Earl Lancaster was pleased
with the meeting, saying 'the
Pro-Rector's presence at the
meeting was a positive move.' A
Hall Rep present at the meeting
felt Linstead had done well, and
said that the Pro-Rector would
recommend that the bar is
reopened. Another point raised
at the meeting was over the new
fire alarm system which has yet
again came in for criticism as it
has proved to be far too sensitive
and generally unworkable.
The Pro-Rector again re-iter-
ated the College's commitment
to an 'alcohol awareness' cam-
paign, citing last week's fracas as
an example for the need to stem
out the rise of drunken behaviour
over the past few years.
Many physics undergraduates
feel that the department's social
facilities are sorely wanting -
there is now only the small and
uncomfortable basement com-
mon room with its poor and
unreliable food and drink facili-
ties.
Dr David Southwood, head of
physics, stated "I have ... almost
uniformly received requests that
the department ban smoking in
all public areas", yet it is estimat-
ed that nearly one third of
physics students smoke and the
number appears to be growing.
The department's decision is be
an unpopular one and its conse-
quences are likely to be counter
productive. The pressure is on
the department to find an alter-
native area.

Bar Steward Leaves
Phil Eatock, a Bar Steward of Da
Vinci's, resigned last week citing
the increasing pressures of work
for his leaving. Members of the
bar staff were saddened by his
departure, commenting that he
was a capable and well liked col-
league.
RCS Vice-President
Resigns
The RCS are left VP-less
after the present incumbent,
Ruth Child, resigned last Friday,
just before the RCS A G M .
Although most of the posts at the
meeting were filled, no one came
forward to be the new VP,
despite suggestions that a Hall
Re-app was interested in the job.
Union Opt Out
Available
Nigel Wheatley, Assistant
registrar, has invited students
who wish to 'opt out' of Imperial
College Union to come forward.
Under the Conservative
Governments' higher education
reforms of recent years, mem-
bership of the University Union
is no longer automatic. However,
so few students at IC have
expressed an interest in resigning
their membership that Imperial
staff assume that all students will
choose to remain in ICU unless
they indicate otherwise. Last
year only two students out of a
possible 7500 exercised their
new-found rights.
Nonetheless, Matthew
Crompton, Deputy President
(Finance and Services) has indi-
cated that only 54% of students
have so far come to claim their
ICU membership cards. Union
stewards will only accept college
swipe cards as proof of identity
for admission to ICU events until
the end of November. After this
point students will need to have
union cards to get in.
Students who wish to exer-
cise their right under the
Education Act 1994 formally to
opt out of ICU and CCU mem-
bership, may now visit their local
Registry to record their decsion.
Students are advised that the
only practical effect of opting out
will be that they cannot stand for
elected office or take part in
Union elections and referenda.
RCS Homeless
The Royal College of
Science are effectively threat-
ened with eviction from their
current premises in the Old
Chemistry building. College
Estates workmen will be cutting
off all power, water and gas to
the Grade II listed building at
the end of the month, in prepa-
ration for its eventual demoli-
tion.
The RCSU have been having
lengthy consultations over their
move from Chemistry, and had
been offered replacement acco-
modation in a refurbished part of
Civ Eng. However, the move has
stalled until discussions over the
facilities for the new office,
including a garage for the
RCSU's Fire Engine mascot, are
resolved.
Boating Disaster
A Rowing Club training excur-
sion went disastrously wrong
when a novice team 'eight' cap-
sized their boat in the middle of
the Thames.
Two of the club's crews
were racing when one of the
boats lost control and slewed
sideways. The cox, a novice oars-
man himself, could do nothing to
stop the fast moving current
from taking the boat down-
stream. The Â£10,000 boat collid-
ed with a mooring buoy and was
broken in half. Fortunately the
crew were able to release them-
selves and swim to safety. "We
were lucky to have escaped with
our lives." commented a relieved
oarsman.
