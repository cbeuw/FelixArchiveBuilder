film: haramuya^my
Drissa Toure's Haramuya is not a
film that will slip down the slimy
culverts of mainstream cinema,
though this is no excuse to miss it.
Seek it out at the arthouses, and
don't expect pretence.
'Ioure is a strictlyself-made cin-
ematographer and hence doesn't
cater to the usual etiched symbol-
ism and tiresome allegories that are
modem film's signposts.
His second picture, Haramuya
paints a physical portrait of
Burkino Faso's capital
Ouagadougou (og-a-doo-goo)
while the film's style and attitude
brilliandy captures the social side.
A changing city where tensions are
high between the police and the
people, the rich and the poor, the
black and the white, the moslem
and the atheists but mostly
between the old and the young.
The plot centres around a single
family headed by a religious and
traditional man, and follows his son
as he breaks away from the pres-
sures of his extended family and
tries to make something for him-
self amongst the corruption and
poverty.
The film has a 'Slacker' style,
switching ambiguously between
scenes and leaving die message
subtly disguised. By the end you
feel that you know the city and
understand something of the peo-
ple there. There is plenty of 'sub-
plot' and humour too. Haramuya
should prove enjoyable and insight-
ful for anyone who's mind remains
free of the detritus of the
Hollywood thriller-violence-sex
flaUilence.
