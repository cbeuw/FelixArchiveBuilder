album: pulp- different class™
album: perfection:
a perfeeto compilation,iaul shore
There has been an abundance of dance compila-
tion albums around lately, but Perfecto has stood
out amongst the crowd as a label achieving great
commercial success whilst still maintaining its
integrity.
Mixed by Mr. Perfecto himself, Paul
Oakenfold, 'Perfection' contains the cream of
the crop with well known tunes, such as 'Not
over yet' by Grace, alongside excellent under-
ground tunes. Man With No Name's song called
'Floor essence' shows exactly what Perfecto is all
about - it's a great tune with a harder, trancey
edge.
Once again, Paul Oakenfold has let his mix-
ing talent shine through. There may be better
dance compilations but they will be few and far
between. (8)
album: built to spill:
there's nothing wrong
with lovenck
Built to Spill sound like Blind Melon ought to
and in that respect they get rated pretty well.
Typical angsty American pop mixes with funky
guitar and rhythmic percussion create an infec-
tiously toe-tapping sound.
Opener 'In the morning' builds from a
plaintive solo voice to an excellent axe-led
crescendo. 'Fling' shows off some natty acoustic
fretwork while the delightfully titled 'Distopian
dream girl' mixes funk, pop and shouting about
unrequited love. 'Big dipper' is arguably the best
track on the album - a chunky guitar opening and
then a crash through four minutes of pop.
The Foo Fighters have picked Built to Spill
to support them on tour. Why not support them
too? (7)
