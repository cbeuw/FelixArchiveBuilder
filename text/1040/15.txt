NETSPEDITICW
A team from Imperial is presently organising an
expedition to the Amazon rainforest. The expedition
will involve a thousand mile river journey along the
Xingu tributary of the Amazon and will take place
during the summer of 1996.
The unique feature of this expedition is that using
mobile communication, the team will run a
continuously updated Web site so the expedition
can be experienced interactively in real time. Most
importantly, the principle aim of the project is to
show that research in a very inhospitable region can
be carried out remotely by scientist and students
guiding the team through the Internet link.
Sounds crazy? Well it is and we are looking for one
more highly enthusiastic lunatic to join the team.
He/she will have a life science/medical background
and must be capable of organising the research and
establishing links with the scientific institutions prior
to departing. Owing to the nature of the expedition
he/she will be physically fit and must be able to
survive without Baywatch for 2 months.
Interested? then email Matthew
