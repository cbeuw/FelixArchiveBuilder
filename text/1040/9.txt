Male Genes: A Key to Female Breast Cancer
October was breast cancer awareness month. Bringing the disease to the media forefront, it
oudined the minimum standards of care that every women should expect. But how many
men are aware that they are susceptible too?
L
ast year in Britain, breast cancer
claimed the lives of nearly 16,000
women and 98 men. One in every
twelve women in the United Kingdom
can expect to develop breast cancer at some time in
their life and of these cases 55% will prove to be
fatal. Only 200 men develop breast cancer each
year, but in women the disease is by far the most
common type of cancer, leading to one in five
female cancer deaths.
Although male breast cancer is rare, scientists
believe that a small number of men could poten-
tially hold the key to many inherited breast cancers
in women. A
team of scien-
tists led by
the Cancer
R e s e a r c h
C a m p a i g n
have been
working on
male breast
c a n c e r .
Together with
colleagues in
America and
Europe, they
have discov-
ered that BRCA1, the gene thought to be widely
involved in inherited breast cancer, is not responsi-
ble in families which include men who suffer from
the disease.
Some breast cancer sufferers are predisposed to
the disease due to a genetic susceptibility. In other
words, you are
more at risk if
you have a
mother, sister or
daughter who
has had breast
cancer and this
risk is intensified
further if more
than one close rel-
ative has been
affected. The team
at the Institute of
Cancer Research,
led by Dr Mike Stratton, set out to examine the role
of BRCA1 in families which included cases of
both male and female breast cancer. The big sur-
prise was that only a small proportion of cases were
due to the already cloned BRCA1 gene.
They concluded from their research that there
must be another 'mystery gene' in addition to
BRCA1 which, while indicating a genetic predis-
position to develop breast cancer, also results in a
high risk of male breast cancer.
Researchers involved in the human genome pro-
ject are currently working towards the isolation and
identification of this mystery gene. They then hope
to develop a test for the faulty gene, so that those
who have inheritedthe gene could be identified and
offered screening while those who have not could
be reassured.
Are You At Risk?
Increasing age is the
most significant factor
which increases the risk
of developing breast can-
cer, but family history, not
having children, starting
periods at an early age
and obesity have all been
linked to the disease.
Other factors, which are
still under evaluation,
include:-
VHigh fat diet
^Prolonged use of oral
contraception
VAlcohol
>/Stress

Seeing Double Saves Lives
Taking two \-rav mammc; i dilferenl
angles instead of one dramatically improves ill-,
chances of spotting breast tumours. This is the
finding of research commissioned by the Breast
Cancer Screening Program, rcpoaed earlier this
hillietta Patix, f licet tor of the program,
said the new method has been practiced by
screening centres since August and has resulted
in the detection of 24% more tumours in over
50s. However in younger women (who account
for a third of all cases) it is much harder to spot
the disease. Jullietta explained, "Screening does-
n't work lor under 50s because die breast tex-
ture is different, but students at Imperial
College should not worry too much,, thankfully
breast cancer in under 25s is very, very uncom-
mon." Her advice to all women is to become
more 'breast aware', "If you notice any changes
such as lumps or tough patches of skin you
'
• go straight to your CP." Thanks t

em treatments, 85% of women now survive the
disease, provided it is detected in its early stages.
