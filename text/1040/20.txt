Poor Tillo
Okay, I just thought it was a
little off when he stared at my
proffered hand with disdain
when we were introduced, as if a
scummy little student like
myself didn't at all deserve to
touch the hallowed paw. But I
felt utterly chastised: apparently
Michael Portillo is the only MP
the Conservatives have had come
to speak here that has ever sent
a reply to their letter to thanks.
Clearly he is a lovely charming
bloke and not in the least bit odi-
ous.
Consoc's Ian Bayley had
some further pearls of wisdom
on noting that the Felix editor
was not in her place of work at a
time when you might reasonably
expect a salaried member of staff
to be about their business. He
helpfully noted that it was
dreadful what the trade unions
were doing to disrupt our public
transport. Interestingly, it was
not a tube strike that made it
take DA hours to get between
Wimbledon and South
Kensington, but rather a signal
failure followed by a broken
down train.
Could it be that the govern-
ment has left our rail network
underfunded?
Torn to Shreds
It has been a bit of a week
from Hell, quite frankly, what
with 2,500 copies of the
Career's Fair Brochure to staple
by hand. And I guess things must
be a little difficult for the Rag
posse these days, what with hav-
ing no chairperson and such. But
did they really have to demand
four pages of publicity, miss 2
meetings to discuss the contents,
consistently fail to meet dead-
lines, finally turn up with 3 para-
graphs of text 4 days late, wait
until a good many hours had
been spent putting their disor-
ganisation into some sort of for-
mat, then proceed to cancel the
entire thing, and then change
their mind and the details again
the next morning?
So I don't particularly know
if any of the information on
pages 6 and 7 is particularly
accurate... [I have a feeling
there's something about a pint-a-
grams (see RCS) and flans (see
Guild's)]. Which is a shame real-
ly, because Rag week is bound to
be home to one or two of those
memories that you take away
from IC to keep you awake at
night cringing. I just don't think
you've really lived until you've
done something very embarrass-
ing at the Beer festival. That's
my excuse, and I'm sticking to it.
