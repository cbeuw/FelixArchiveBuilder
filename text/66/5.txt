LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
WHO IS CASSANDRA. WHAT IS SHE?
S i r ,
I must protest against the l i b e l o u s accus-
ations of "Cassandra", who, i n the l a s t FELIX,
f a l s e l y divided the honourable male community
at I.C. into s i x ignoble groups.
Such wicked propaganda i s i n t o l e r a b l e !
This Cassandra woman has sought to i n d o c t r i n a t e
the young,pure, innocent fresherettas with f a l s e
teachings. Shu has attempted to indoctrinate the
female freshers when they are at t h e i r f r e s h e s t .
She han shown h e r s e l f to be an enemy of our manly
society, and to be g u i l t y of making statements
against the Interest of the community.
Allow me to advise the fresherettes to pay
no a t t e n t i o n to t h i s Cassandra, but t o read these
f a c t a , whioh are free from a l l aubjeotive motivest
The "Old and Battered" i s a brigade of o l d -
timers whose a c t i v i t i e s a r e i - avoiding the oharm-
Jng, oultured men at I.e.; dining together; cluck-
ing together; dancing together; s i t t i n g out tog-
ether; and o c c a s i o n a l l y entertaining males from
other lower-order Colleges. They are the most un-
oo-operatlve s e c t i o n of our society, waging a con-
t i n u a l cold-war. T h e i r most treaoherous acts are
the t w i s t i n g of facta f o r t h e i r own gain, and
dangerous propaganda work with the f r e s h e r e t t e s ,
against the wishes of the masses of I.C.
When next auch subversive a c t i v i t y occurs,
I s h a l l i n s i s t that Cassandra be i n v e s t i g a t e d
by an experienced sub-oommittee.
May I , on behalf of the magnificent I.C.
men, assure the new, splendid, charming , p r e t t y
f r e s h e r e t t e s of our co-operating attentions at
a l l convenient times.
Yours " f a i t h f u l l y " ,
T i l l Death Us do Part.
Detir S i r ,
We f e e l I t l a inoumbent upon ourselves $»
write a few words of reassurance to those who
may f e e l oonoern for t h e tender^euioeptibllitie*
of our new freBhers.
In oommon with other librarians not yet
purged by the swindon magistrates we are natur-
a l l y uneasy about t h e corroding effects on young
ninds of some of the books whioh we atook; but
we f a e l t h a t t h e d a n g e r may be easily exaggerat-
ed. I t i s true that ( i n t h e interests of L i t e r -
ature) we p o s s e s s r e p l i c a s o f that same "Decam-
eron" whioh h a s r e c e n t l y b e e n a d v e r t i s e d f a r be-
yond i t s o r i g i n a l e s o t e r i c c i r c l e ; but they are
so seldom to be s e e n on o u r shelves that there
Is little- d a n g e r of t h e i r f a l l i n g into inexper-
ienced hands. We also keep ( i n the interests of
Solonoa) t h e K i n n e y R e p o r t s , b u t t h e s e a r e usu-
a l l y on loan t o s o c i o l o g i c a l reeaarohea (of whom
t*i«re a j j e a r t o be u largo number i n I.0,)> and
are very often n e l d for m o n t h s at a time while
tne masaes of i n f o r m a t i o n i n tuem a r e tabulated
and digested.
We v i l l i not deny t n a t we h a v e purchased ( i n
tne interests o f C l a s s i c a l s t u d i e s ) O v i d ' s "Art
of Love", and ( i n t u e I n t e r e s t s o f Everyman)
