CASSANDRA SPEAKS AGAIN
Since we dipped our pen In v i t r i o l the
nib has r o t t e d away. But m o b i l i s i n g our second
best q u i l l , we are going to t e l l you (In response
to your many enquiries) about our personal tar.te
i n men. We consulted our l i s t of e l i g i b l e bachel-
ors(nylon s h i r t s and terylene socks e s s e n t i a l )
and what we found there set us thinking. This l a
what we thought.
Why i s i t that R.C.S. has such a monopoly
of weedy brownbaggers, l a c k i n g In charm and c u l -
ture?
Why i s i t that Gulldsmen, though usually
pleasant, charming and courteous, are often
rather d u l l ?
Why are the Miners so much better thun the
r e s t ?
Miners are the sort of men a g i r l l l k ^ o t o
meet; Engineers are the sort of men a g i r l ' " , moth-
er l i k e s to meet; but who i n h?r se:ese wants to
meet the I.C. brand of s c i e n t i s t ?
Cassandra,
R.C.S. men who f e e l exceptional should t r a n s f e r to
Mines immediately.
I t i s n o t u n o f f i o l a l l y d e n i e d t h a t the
I.C.w.S.C. p o t w i l l be i n use t h i s fteos'tim. No
d e t a i l s are: unknown.
