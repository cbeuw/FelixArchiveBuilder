AC. UNION MEE T/NG
The f i r s t Union Meeting of the Session
was held on Monday, Oat. 11th. i n the H.C.S.
The President opened the meeting by ask-
ing everyone to stand i n silence f o r one min-
ute, as a mark of respeot to the Rector.
He then announced, as most of the College
knew, that Commemoration Day and Commemoration
B a l l were oanoelled f o r t h i s year, but that
f u l l mourning f o r the Union would end that
night (the day of the f u n e r a l ) . I t was hop-
ed that some kind of Union B a l l would be held
Instead of the Commem. B a l l , l a t e r i n the Ses-
sion.
The main business-of the meeting was taken
up with a discussion of the arrangements f o r
Nov. 3th. The discussion consisted mostly of
remarks from the President, who performed h i s
thankless task with remarkable diplomacy and
taot. His object was to put over to the Union
why once, again Nov. 5th. must pass unheralded
as an occasion f o r a Rag, at l e a s t as;- o f f i c -
i a l l y recognised. The reasons were strong;
f i r s t l y the Union could not expect i t s elected
and responsible o f f i c e r s to organise Rags,
whioh should be e s s e n t i a l l y spontaneous; and
secondly, aa a r e s u l t of l a s t year's events the
U.L. Senate had Issued an ultimatum to a l l Lon-
don students and had asked f o r the co-operation
of U.L.U. The ultimatum was to the e f f e c t
that any student i n trouble with the A u t h o r i t i e s
on November 5th. would be sent down. The Union
acknowledged these reasons and was then asked
to .consider what I.C. would do instead of a Rao
on Nov. 5th. The President indicated that the
reason f o r the date of the present meeting
was that the Union would thus have plenty of
time to oonslder what waa to be done. L i t t l e
arose from the f l o o r on t h i s matter so that
most probably, aa usual, I.C. w i l l o f f i c i a l l y
be at Harlington f o r Guy Fawkes Day.
Other business waa the e l e c t i o n of B a s i l
Evana and Also Fraser to the Entertainments
Committee, and the selection of 'Hags' Slater
s s an 'ERE, the custodian of Herbert's key.
The attendance at the meeting was about 250,
whioh was small considering the importance of
the agenda. This i s where the loss of the Gym
beoomea most marked, since there i s now no oentral
meeting-plaoe. Possibly also Guildsmen and
Miners are l o t h to go into the R.C.S.
| The tone of the meeting was very subdued,
one almost might say tame f o r a Union meeting,
remembering the informality and blunt speaking
i n the Gym. I t i s to be hoped that the Union
w i l l keep the temper of i t s Meetings up to the
old l i v e l y l e v e l , whioh does not mean, the whole-
sale slinging of fireworks, but does mean par-
t i c i p a t i o n , both i n wit and i n p l a i n speaking,
from the f l o o r as well as from the Chair.
