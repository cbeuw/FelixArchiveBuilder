link to the College’s smoke free poli-
cy in the emails, which details where
smoking is and isn’t allowed.
Some Departments did not forward
the email, but composed their own. In
the email to Bioengineering students,
Graeme Rae, Department Operations
Manager, told students that it “does
not present our university in the best
light for visitors”, as well as mention-
ing the smell it causes in the reception
area.
Signs have been placed around Hux-
ley’s Main Entrance, and security will
monitor the area and “advise any peo-
ple smoking there that they should not
be”. Nick Roalfe, Director of Facilities
and Property Management, will raise
the issues to any students or staﬀ who
are not complying with the smoke free
policy.
