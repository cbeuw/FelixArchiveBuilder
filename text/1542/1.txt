Imperial College Union have contin-
ued the pressure on Imperial College
London over the plans for halls in
Acton. here has continued to be un-
ease amongst the student body about
the plans. he issue has been raised
and discussed at numerous meetings,
including the Student Welfare Com-
mittee, and College Senate (which is a
body that is chaired by the President &
Rector, and is made up of various aca-
demics and management staﬀ). Paul
Beaumont, Union President, said that
the College’s response has been “seem-
ingly positive”. He said that he is “glad
that some academics and staﬀ are as
concerned about the site and annoyed
at the way in which the whole project
was handled as we are.” here has been
no word thus far on the future of Gar-
den Hall, which could be turned into
oﬃce space, or the halls in Evelyn

he decision on the fate of the Trans-
lation Studies Unit (TSU) has been
delayed until June leaving all involved
uncertain about their future. he
Management Board of Imperial Col-
lege London met on Friday 22 Febru-
ary to review the feedback gathered
from staﬀ, students and external in-
terested parties on the future of the
TSU. hey decided that new research
activities in the TSU will not be start-
ed, and that new students will not be
admitted to the MSc or PhD courses
until after the ﬁnal decision is made.
It is also understood that they will
have to try to ﬁnd a new home else-
where themselves.
he TSU started a campaign against
being closed or moved. A petition was
created, which has over 6,400 signa-
tures at time of going to print, and is
steadily gaining more. he signatures
come from all areas of the globe, in-
cluding academics at a wide variety
of institutions. he Union supports
their campaign, after a paper was
brought to Union Council about the
issue. he paper stated that the Union
wants further clarity over why
College say they will answer students’ questions through Felix. To ask: email
felix@imperial.ac.uk and the COO and Pro-Rector (Education) will answer you.
