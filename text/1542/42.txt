This week slugs are the new
model organisms (Drosophila
were so last century) so you’ll
be getting all the attention! But
then the researchers put you
in a blender and make you into
a slug smoothie for lunch. You
don’t even get to die to further
scientific understanding – you
were just the unlucky target of
a hungry post-doc.
... Too ashamed to leave your
house, you are free to concen-
trate on your studies without
distractions. Typing with anten-
nae is painfully slow and your
sticky mucus glues your text-
books’ pages together. Your
housemates kick you out for
leaving slime trails on the toilet
seat and you are forced to live in
Hyde Park. You fail your degree.
This week your lecturer turns
you into a giant slug as a
punishment for handing your
coursework in late. Capping
the pass mark at 40% for late
submissions just hasn’t been
getting the message across,
so you are made an example of
in front of all your coursemates.
You suddenly, unexpectedly
morph into a Taurus...
Life as a slug can sometimes
be hard. This week is espe-
cially tough when you pass
cousin Snail in the garden,
showing off its shell to the lady
slug you have a crush on. Lat-
er, you see them exchanging
hygroscopic fluids behind the
garden shed but are bitterly
smug in the knowledge they’ll
never have viable offspring.
This week you can’t get over
cousin Snail sucking your
crush’s antennae so propose
that you all go on a family holi-
day to France for some win-
ter sun. As soon as you land
in Calais the French notice
Snail’s exotic English shell and
devour him with garlic sauce,
leaving you free to get slimy
with Lady slug. SCORE!
This week you exchange
some premium compost for
a special baggie of slug party
pills. But turns out they’re cut
with slug pellets and as you’re
shrivelling up, you curse your
dealer Ernie the backstabbing
earthworm. Your family plan
a funeral and a grave in your
favourite lettuce patch, but the
birds get to you first.
This week you have slugs living
in your drain. They develop a
taste for human hair and soon
enough, the shampoo-caked
plughole pubes cannot satisfy
their cravings – they want gour-
met hair. They emerge from the
bathtub and devour your eye-
brows while you sleep. When
you awake, a thin crust of slime
is all that remains.
This week you fall in love with
a giant slug and eventually
marry him. After a few years
of home cooking and romantic
meals out, Slug gets fat. The
increasingly restrictive wed-
ding ring around his paunch
causes pressure to build up
and he eventually bursts. You
are left to weep in a pool of his
slime.
This week you run out of lube
and decide to improvise: you
grab a nearby slug and rub its
slimy surface on your lady bits
for improved lubrication (wet-
ter is better!), inadvertently
transferring some slug eggs
along with the slime. They
hatch and grow in your womb,
and slither out a week later, 1ft
long. It’s strangely arousing…
This week you’ve heard that
slug faeces is very moisturising
and apply it liberally to your face
to complement your spa treat-
ment. Unfortunately, you’re al-
lergic to slug digestive products
and you become permanently
disfigured with antennae-like
protrusions extending from your
noseandaconstantfilmofslime
leaching from your eyes. Pint?
This week a poisonous slug
takes up residence in your
appendix and its toxic mucus
slowly spreads through your
organs. The doctors amputate
body parts one by one to try
and contain the infection but
eventually all that’s left of you
is your eyes. The last thing you
see is the gaping cavity of the
slug’s digestive tract.
This week you must choose be-
tween eating a giant slug burger
(with slime relish) and having
a slug permanently residing
in your nostril. The nostril-slug
wouldn’t be aesthetically pleas-
ing, it would be fairly harmless,
while the slug burger wouldn’t
permanentlydisfigurebutwould
probz put you off cheezeburg-
ers 4 lyf. What’s it going to be?
