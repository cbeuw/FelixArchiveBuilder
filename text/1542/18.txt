FRIDAY 01 MARCH
18
Meredith Thomas
There is something in the air
ollege seems to be on the
anti-smoking warpath
again. Bins and ashtrays
are mysteriously disap-
pearing from places like
the RSM entrance and my inbox is ﬁll-
ing up with passive-aggressive emails.
Interfering busy-bodies have made it
their mission to enforce the ridiculous
‘smoke-free’ zones around campus and
teenagers with the glazed look of Jeho-
vah’s witnesses, wearing NHS tabards,
roam the streets ambushing perfectly
innocent pedestrians. All right and
good? No it is bloody not. I am a
proud smoker and I am starting to
get seriously peeved.
For me personally smoking is not
a tragic addiction. I am not crying out
for an intervention, desperate for a
passer-bytosavemefromacrippling
vice. I smoke because I genuinely en-
joy it and my choice is a rational one.
I ﬁnd the process of rolling a cigarette
and contemplatively breathing in
the smoke almost meditative. I
love the social aspect of hunker-
ing down in a doorway, sheltering
from the rain and putting the world
to rights with a friend. I love the gentle
ﬂirting over zippo ﬂame outside a club.
I love watching smoke lazily climb into
a dusky sky over a glass of red wine. I
love the post-coital surge of nicotine
out of a bedroom window as my girl-
friend dozes in bed and most of all I
live for those early morning moments,
walking alone, watching the light of the
moon bounce of the millpond surface
of the hames.
Here is the big scoop. I am not go-
ing to stop just because a puckered
lipped old granny fakes a cough. I am
a stubborn mule and the intrusion of
anti-smoking crusaders is only going to
make me more so. I will give up when I
am good an ready and not a single min-
ute before.

The College’s current tirade against smokers is stupid and unfair –
smokers should be proud of what they do, says Meredith Thomas
Smokersasagrouphavebeenmarked
out as a scourge on society and a free-
ﬁre zone for snide remarks, unwanted
criticism and outright bullying. When
the smoking ban was suggested a lot of
people saw the sense in the policy and
gracefully rolled over. However, this
seems to have set a precedent for a roll-
ing process of increasing stringent rules
about when and where a smoker can in-
dulge in an activity, which is essentially
an individual’s choice. Well, I no longer
feel obliged to subscribe to the
lip- service. he
feeling
of being
s t r a i g h t-
jacketed into
a weird self-
loathing has gone
on long enough and
it’s time smokers started
standing up for themselves
Here is a common myth: by
smoking I am costing the tax-
payer through my future health
costs. his is wrong. In 2009, re-
searchers from Oxford University es-
timated the annual cost of smoking to
the NHS at £5bn. hat sounds like a lot,
right? But it pales in comparison to the
£9.5bn that excise duty on cigarettes
contributed to the treasury in the same
year. On top of this, the sale of tobacco
contributes billions more through VAT
and corporation tax. So, I pay for my
habit, a few times over in fact.
Here is another: passive smoking
kills. Yes, it does aﬀect long term health
outcomes but you need a lot of expo-
sure. he amount of smoke breathed in
by waitresses and barmen in conﬁned
environments, over the course of their
career has been shown to have a sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect. However this argument
does not extend to outdoor locations,
no matter what your proximity to a
building entrance. hat is just common
sense, I’m afraid.
Finally: smoking kills. No one is de-
nying that smoking dramatically aﬀects
your chances of acquiring conditions
like lung cancer and vascular stenosis.
However some slightly awkward re-
search from the University of Toronto
shows reductions in life expectancy
are almost totally negated if you
quit before the age of 40. It
turns out that smoking is
bad for you in a much
more speciﬁc way than
people would have
us believe. If you
restrain from
s m o k i n g
a r o u n d
kids or
f o r
a n
ex-
tremely
long period
of your life it is
simply is not that
bad. Shock horror, the
rigorous and reliable sci-
ence of epidemiology has led
us astray again.
So what are we left with as a justiﬁca-
tion for hounding smokers further and
further into the wind and rain? What
reasons do we quote for ostracising this
particular portion of society? Wait for
it… Some people do not like the smell?
Well screw them, quite frankly. I ﬁnd
lots of things annoying - bad breath,
bad fashion sense, bad music - but I
am not deluded enough to believe for
a minute that my opinions give me the
right to tell other people how to live
their lives. If you do not want to smell
the smoke all you have to do is get out
of my face.
here is one ﬁnal objection from a
recent email: “[Smokers do] not present
our university in the best light for visi-
tors.” his seems to be suggesting that
College want to airbrush out around a
third of the undergraduate community
for aesthetic reasons, which is frankly
bizarre and barely merits a rebuttal.
If we are happy with this argument I
would suggest we ﬁrst focus our atten-
tion on tackling the problem of Ugg
boots on campus.
Having found very little to support
the current purge, here are my sug-
gestions. If you are the type of person
who rolls your eyes and tuts every time
you choose to brush the edge of some
transient puﬀ of smoke, my advice is
to suck it up, get over yourself, show
a bit of empathy and ﬁnd something
more important to worry about. To my
brothers and sisters who enjoy the oc-
casional puﬀ on a cheroot, cigarillo or
humble rollie, show a bit of pride. here
is no need to pretend to be quitting
when you clearly do not want to. Let’s
keep doing our thing and when the
anti-smoking Stasi kick up a fuss, smile,
edge away and wait for them to turn the
corner before ignoring them.
Better still, how about we all try to
show a bit of understanding for other
people’s life choices. Now I have ﬁn-
ished writing this I am going to have a
fag and woe betide anyone who tries to
get in my way.

Letters
Dear Sir,
Save me.
I write concerning an issue crucial
for the maintenance of my sanity. I
ﬁnd myself, on a daily basis, sorely
and ﬂirtatiously tempted, only to have
the roaring ﬂame of my desire erupt
into an unbridled explosion of anger,
as I see my future dreams quashed by
the iron hammer of ineptitude. I can
only thank reality that I’m a tough guy
and, as such, well- practiced in calmly
walking away from such explosions.
However, with this daily cycle of rejec-
tion, I don’t hold out much hope for
my sanity. It is a dwindling resource,
and its scarcity alarms me. I fear the
day things overﬂow in the Library
Cafe and people end up with ABCs
where no ABC has a right to be.
he object of my temptation, that
divinity made ﬂesh, is, of course, the
college-wide ICT screensaver. It is a
cock-tease. A veritable lure of labia.
As I peruse the news feed of highly rel-
evant information I ﬁnd my cerebral
organ engorged by the thrill of it all.
And as my interest reaches climax I
make that fateful reach for the mouse,
determined to ﬁnd out more about
this bite-size serving of knowledge.
My intention, cruelly conditioned by
use of the internet, is to click the story
that grabs me and see it in its full and
unadulterated glory.
But alas, no sooner have I touched
the mouse than the dream evaporates.
Expecting penetration into the realm
of learning, I’m thwarted. In the heat
of the climax, standing between the
gates of the majora, is the Gandalf of
ICT, a fearsome sight bellowing “you
shall not pass!” Of course, I’m con-
fronted with “Ctrl-Alt-Delete to log
on.”
And as the glory of the news story
fades from my memory like a dream
on waking, the prospect of ﬁnding out
more has all but disappeared. I resign
myself to the formalities of logging on
and ‘getting-on-with-what-I-came-
here-to-do.’ Touched by divinity but
unable to touch.
hus concludes one episode of my
daily cycle of desire and rejection.
With what little energy I have left I can
only petition the controllers at ICT to
make the screen saver more interac-
tive, or be done with it entirely.
Yours in resignation,
A. Student.
Dear Sir,
I was reading the article on Paragon
halls, and although they are further
than Orient, it seems important to
mention how some of us at Orient last
year had similar problems with regards
to getting to and from uni and the ex-
tra travel expenses (not as expensive as
Zones 1-4 but still not covered by our
loans), and our rent was around £20
more expensive a week too! I really
don’t understand why Imperial feels
the need to put us all in halls which are
so much further than aﬀordable.
