FRIDAY 01 MARCH
16
David Goldsmith
A whole week of giving
midst a week of bungee
jumping, cartoon col-
lecting, pizza eating,
Dark Knight-watching,
serenading, raﬄing and
masked dancing £11,305 worth of
coins rained down on our buckets.
his brought our total generated for
charity in the year so far to £47,556.48
– more than TRIPLE that raised in the
entirety of last year and we have yet to
reach third term!
So how did this happen? How did
Imperial College RAG make the turn-
around from an almost defunct soci-
ety to one that is so prosperous?
When I took the position of RAG
Chair in the summer elections of
last year I was making a bold move.
Whilst there had been a strong tradi-
tion of RAG at Imperial for many dec-
ades, enthusiasm had waned over the
years and it was failing terribly when
it came to engaging students. It might
have seemed as if Imperial students
didn’t care about charity but I was
sure that this wasn’t the case and set
about working out why it wasn’t work-
ing.
he committee of last year con-
sisted of around 3 active members,
too few to get anything done by any-
one’s stretch of imagination. So I rang
everyone I knew over the summer
and progressively formed a team now
consisting of 15 central members and,
thanks to the hard work of our Halls
Oﬃcer Joe Gibbs, 34 RAG Hall Reps
who represent RAG within the under-
graduate halls.
We decided the RAG logo and
branding were outdated so we
scrapped them. Working with the Un-
ion we developed the new splat logo
and slapped it on a load of t-shirts
and stickers, ready to take over Im-
perial. Freshers’ Fair
was the chance to
make our mark so
we took it by storm.
We danced by our
DJ booth, taking it
in turns to get cov-
ered in whipped
cream, and engaged
anyone who hap-
pened to walk past.
We generated over
1000 sign-ups for
our mailing list –
a RAG-record for
sure.
What followed was
a series of incredibly
successful events with
maximum participation (visit
union.ic.ac.uk/rag for full details).

As the committee and volunteers get back into the swing of work,
RAG Chair David Goldsmith reflects on the week
Our Poppy Appeal collect generated
96 volunteers, raising over £10,000
for the Royal British Legion. Our Ru-
bik’s cube ball packed out Metric. We
held a simple Bake Sale and managed
to raise a whopping £1723! So as you
can see Imperial is most deﬁnitely not
short of those intent on raising for
charity.
Recognition then came from the
outside world in the form of a prize
for the most innovative fundrais-
ing idea for our 24-hour row on the
Queen’s Lawn, getting our committee
invited to the BBC Children in Need
Live Show. We were succeeding, and
when Christmas came we knew we
had generated the power to grab the
attention of the whole university with
our RAG week. So we met with the
Rector and other members of College
staff and brought something to Impe-
rial that had never been seen before…
a 164 foot high Bungee Jump. Tickets
sold out straightaway, sponsorship
was raised in the thousands and the
spectacle dazzled all.
If you had asked many Imperial stu-
dents at the beginning of the year what
RAG was you might have received an
unsure response: ‘What’s that?’ or ‘Is
it that thing medics do?’ (For clariﬁ-
cation IC RAG is a separate entity to
ICSM RAG!). Now you would be very
hard pressed to ﬁnd someone who
hasn’t felt our impact.
hrough the work of the RAG com-
mittee, in hand with the students of
Imperial, at least £46,000 more has
been raised for our charities this year
that would not have been raised oth-
erwise. But this success is compound-
ed. We have generated the awareness
and enthusiasm that will ensure a tra-
dition of RAG that will last for many
years to come.
To continue we need more
talented and driven people
to get involved. If you want to
help ensure RAG’s success in
coming years and to partici-
pate in next year’s committee
e-mail me at ragchair@ic.ac.
uk. he new committee shall
be formed in the third term of
this year.
I’d like to make a special
mention to the following
people:
• Callum Kirk (Treasurer)
whose superhuman eﬃcien-
cy and determination has
helped ensure RAG’s success.
• Christopher Winchurch
(Vice-chair and Publicity Of-
ﬁcer) who spent days on end
designing the RAG guides
and posters for RAG week.
• Joseph Gibbs (Hall Reps Oﬃcer)
who spread the word of RAG to the
halls.
To continue
we need
more talented
and driven
people to get
involved
