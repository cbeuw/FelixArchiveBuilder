FRIDAY 01 MARCH
The end of aid?
In October 2012 the Secretary of State
for International Development, Jus-
tine Greeing, announced cuts to the
UK’s £1bn aid programme in India
with a view of focussing on a more
‘trade-based’ relationship. More re-
cently during David Cameron’s ska-
doodle to India in the middle of Feb-
ruary 2013, he praised India’s business
acumen and strong economic growth
in recent years and paraded about
the UK’s commitment to ease trade
and travel regulations between itself
and India which could be seen as a
consummation of the UK’s stance to
development with India. Across the
pond, the Sullivan Foundation, a high
level international development or-
ganisation with political backing from
former President George Bush that
drew attention and ﬁnances from the
halls of US power, recently closed its
doors and now holds a private Africa-
focussed ﬁrm. Western companies
and investors like these are falling
over backwards to engage in the eco-
nomic boom that is slowly underway
in many countries around the world
that were more commonly knows as
“third-world”.
Famously, the Economist in 2011
produced a brightly designed cover
page entitled “Africa Rising” that
many contrasted with their
June 2001 cover-page story
of Africa branding it “he
Dark Continent”. From
Vietnam to the Myanmar
(where multinationals are
moving their manufacturing
processes to, away from an
ageing and ever more expen-
sive China); from Rwanda to
Kenya, where for more than a decade
year-on-year GDP growth is in the
+10 per cent per annum bracket and
is mostly non-commodity driven,
economies that used to be the under-
dogs are now beginning to ﬂex their
economic muscle. hese countries are
drawing international liquidity away
from the West that is still licking its
wounds from the global ﬁnancial cri-
sis and contracting or stagnating na-
tional budgets (in real terms) across
all sectors; and most interestingly for
me as a future healthcare pro-
fessional, the NHS has not
escaped the scalpel of the
government as it looks for
slack to cut.
In the face of all these
global changes and a grow-
ing optimism, countries like
Mozambique for example,
which has grown steadily
at rates of 68 per cent between 1996
and 2008, still face more than a half
of their populations living under the
poverty line of $0.50 a day. he Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo is still in the
middle of civil conﬂict, and the recent
unrest in Mali has done nothing to
improve living standards for its peo-
ple. here is also a growing scepticism
that the positive economic growth
of recent years has done nothing but
increase inequality as Nigerian mil-
lionaires party with Kim Kardashian
in Lagos and the Chinese elite drive
some of the most expensive cars in
the world in Beijing while community
health workers administering polio
vaccines are slain in Northern Nigeria
and the future of China’s rural popu-
lace is still in question. With all this
in mind, what will the future hold for
international development aid, which
has been both greatly praised and at
the same time accused of holding de-
veloping countries back. he panel
debate at the Future of Healthcare De-
velopment Conference on the 6th of
March in the Imperial College Busi-
ness School aims to explore this. In at-
tendance will be the A m b a s -
sador of Eritrea to
the UK among
experts in the
ﬁeld of inter-
national devel-
opment from a
variety of sec-
tors. It prom-
ises to be a fan-
tastic event! For
