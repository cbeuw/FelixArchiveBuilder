FRIDAY 01 MARCH
Warning: may not actually tell you how to win a student election
A super handy guide to
winning a student election
he most exciting event
of the academic calen-
dar since the last excit-
ing event of the aca-
demic calendar is fast
approaching, with nominations for
the Union’s emphatically named
‘Big Elections’ closing imminently.
A few weeks back we put forward a
few suggestions towards the kind of
people you’d want to back you up on
the campaign trail, but don’t worry if
you haven’t got Obama on your side
just yet, here’s Coﬀee Break’s ultimate
guide to winning an election.
Write a manifesto
For the love of Kriss Akabusi, write
a manifesto. Personally, I love vot-
ing for that one enigmatic individual
who refuses to list what they’d do
with the role – it’s a little like voting
for a legendary beast, like Godzilla,
or the Loch Ness Monster. Everyone
else though? I’m not sure about them.
Just face it; if you haven’t submitted a
manifesto to either Felix or the voting
website, then your plans for Union
domination are pretty much scup-
pered. Of course you could cunningly
counter this by getting your friends to
vote for you, if you have literally hun-
dreds of friends with a keen interest
in student politics. Best of luck with
that.
Campaign Posters
Always a solid bet to put a few of
these around. Judging by past years,
it doesn’t even matter how much
sense they make. A jazzy slogan’s
always nice, and if your name is par-
ticularly suitable for publicity-based
manipulation then go for it. I’m not
sure about QR codes though. hink-
ing about it, I believe that I have
never seen an individual take out a
phone and scan a QR code, for any-
thing. Have you? Heck, do you scan
QR codes? Answers on the back of a
postcard please.
Lecture shout-outs
Sure, great idea. hat is, if you get
permission from the lecturer before-
hand. It’d be more than a little cringe-
worthy if you’re in the full throes of
delivering an impassioned spiel about
improving the student experience
only to be drowned out by a micro-
phone-equipped lecturer battling to

actually teach.
Maybe try for a bit of coordination
too and grab a whole lecture theatre
for yourself. Indeed, I was once sub-
jected to ﬁve speeches in a row. All
well-meaning, doubtless, but person-
ally I can only withstand a mono-
logue about why you are the greatest
person to have ever lived if it’s under
two minutes, give or take a second or
three.
Confectionery
Appeal to the stomach. Maybe as-
sociate yourself with a speciﬁc
brand if you’re feeling particularly
entrepreneurial. Oﬀer people solely
Caramacs, for example, and they’ll
associate you with dated policies
and condensed milk. Haribo or any
Haribo-esque derivative is the gold
standard, but experimentation may
yield even greater success on the ﬁeld
of battle.
Standing on tables
I swear down, right here, right now.
If you or anybody else has the sheer
chutzpah to stand on a table that I’m
eating at, I will unequivocally and as-
suredly RON you into devastation.
But that’s just me. Judge the situation
in advance or something.
To those running for any position,
good luck for the campaign period.
If you do succeed in your goals and
get into power, try not to cut loads of
things or lower any credit ratings or
anything like that. We’re in enough
trouble as it is.
Independence Day is vaguely
related to elections
