More than seven thousand ﬁnal year
medics nationwide have been left
stunned and unsure of their future fol-
lowing the retraction of allocated Sit-
uational Judgement Test (SJT) results.
he move, taken by the UK Founda-
tion Programme Oﬃce (UKFPO) on
25 February, means that medics must
undergo yet another nervous wait to
ﬁnd out which hospital will become
their training base.
An oﬃcial statement published on
the UKFPO website justiﬁed its ac-
tions on the basis of a ‘potential error
in the scanning process of the SJT’,
requiring the redaction of individual
student marks; it is a move that has
angered the medical student body
who now feel deeply embittered.
Many argue that it is a blunder, how-
ever unintentional, that is unforgiv-
able, with the students in the midst
of tense ﬁnal examination prepara-
tions. he sense of security attributed
to their prospective placements after
graduation has been removed. Wide-
spread and vitriolic condemnation has
been voiced all over the UK. he feel-
ing of many medics was summed up
by an anonymous Welsh undergradu-
ate, who debated that, “Revising for
ﬁnals is stressful enough without any
added misery”.
Inevitably this has impacted on the
ﬁnal year medics studying at Imperial
College London. Appeals have been
made for calm and rationality in an e-
mail sent on behalf of Professor Jenny
Higham, Director of Education within
the Faculty of Medicine, to the student
body, urging them to, “remember that
the most important thing is to qualify
and to do so as well as you can… Im-
perial College Medical School is de-
termined to support its students; Each
and every one of you.” In addition to
this she expressed her disappointment
at the mistakes made by the UKFPO.
Some say that this disappointment
is justiﬁable, with speculation that the
‘potential error’ rested upon human
error. In an article recently published
by he Guardian newspaper it was
speculated that “errors were caused
by ink-stained photocopied sheets
that could not be read by the auto-
mated marking system”. It has been
conﬁrmed that up to twelve hundred
scripts will undergo revision by hand.
A mounting air of cynicism has been
catalysed by these revelations, being
particularly vocalised on Twitter. One
angry ‘tweet’ read as follows,
“Hilariously #SJT declared great suc-
cess by #UKFPO boss who I suspect
must feel the pain of chicken count-
ing” with another expressing clear and
utter dismay by saying “7,000 future
doctors are being messed around to-
day. On Monday they had jobs. Today
they don’t.”
he above tweets hint at the possible
far-reaching consequences of the SJT
blunder. hese are just two examples
of tweets. Many users took to social
media, with the hashtag #FPAS be-
ing used by many. With the impetus
of time pressurising the UKFPO to
remedy the crisis people are worried
about the objectivity of the impend-
ing re-allocation of students, despite
repeated reassurances from the or-
ganisation. Add to this the repercus-
sions for hospitals where summer and
autumn staﬀ quotas were projected on
the basis of an inﬂux of medic gradu-
ates. he situation is currently under
surveillance by the British Medical
Association. Alice Rutter, co-chair of
the BMA Student Committee, voiced
their stance: “We view this problem
very seriously indeed and will be tak-
ing action to ensure students who
are aﬀected are kept updated”. he
Department of Health issued a terse
response, stating that the incident
“should not have happened.”
Dr Katie Petty-Saphon, Execu-
tive Director of the Medical Schools
Council, and the person responsi-
ble for commissioning the suppliers
that introduced the errors, released a
statement apologising “unreservedly
to all applicants” for the incident. She
said that she understands “how upset-
ting and frustrating it must be to be
told that you have a particular posi-
tion one day – and then to be warned
the next that this might not be the
case”. She went on to say, “Despite ex-
tensive piloting of the test and mark-
ing processes on several occasions, an
unforeseeable and previously unre-
vealed issue came up when the papers
from the live test were scanned for us.
It is with deep regret that this error
only came to light after the allocation
was released. his was in part thanks
to close liaison with Medical Schools.
Having discovered that a small num-
ber of you had been disadvantaged
by the scanning error it would simply
not have been correct knowingly to
allow the process to stand. Let me
reiterate my apologies – we shall
provide the UKFPO with the results
as soon as we are completely conﬁ-
dent that we have done all we can to
ensure their accuracy.
