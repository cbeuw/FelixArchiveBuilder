FRIDAY 01 MARCH

If you were to get a tattoo what would
it be and why? hink about it for a mo-
ment. Perhaps you already have one.
Does it represent anything important to
you or is it purely aesthetic?
For Danzig Daldaev, tattoos shaped his
life. He was born in Russia in 1925 and
condemned in 1948 by the KGB to work
as a warden in Leningrad Prison – as a
‘son of the enemy’
. He devoted his life to
recording tattoos of inmates and docu-
menting their diﬀerent meanings. What
was, at ﬁrst, a curiosity quickly devel-
oped into an obsession and over 50 years
he accumulated a catalogue of over 3000
examples.
Tattooing within prison was illegal and
severely punishable but on discovery of
Daldaev’s project, the KGB decided to
support him in his work. His drawings
provided them with an invaluable crimi-
nal record of a prisoner’s life history; eve-
rythingfrompreviouscrimes,birthplace,
aspirations and even sexuality could be
found out from their tattoos.
One example is of a winged woman
dancing on a hand. he text reads ‘Oh,
ﬁckle fortune, smile on me once more’
.
It describes the thief’s desire to commit
a single large-scale theft, which would al-
low him to give up his life of crime.
Running in parallel with Daldaev, be-
tween1989and1993,wasSergeiVasiliev,
brought in to formally photograph this
underground Russian criminal language.
In his intimate photographs we see his
subjects stripped bear, openly exposing
their adorned bodies to the camera. We
see pride and honour in their faces but
we also sense an element of reserve and
serenity. His subjects are both vulner-
able and strong, which I found part of the
sheer fascination that his photographs
evoke.
Walking around this exhibition I was
drawn to the symbolism of the tattoos
and questioning what they meant and
whytheywerethere.hemysterybehind
the portraits was what initially fascinated
me and translating the illustrations em-
phasised how much the tattoos acted as
a secret language in the Russian criminal
underworld.
If we look further into the picture of
the ‘Man and the Cello’ we see tattoos
of the ‘thieves’ stars’ which openly dis-
play resentment and bitterness towards
authority and can be read as ‘I will not
kneel before the police’
. Furthermore the
manaclesonhisanklessignifythathehas
served sentences of over ﬁve years. But
Lauren Ratcliffe Writer what I found most striking was the jux-
taposition between the sense of vulner-
ability and gentleness in his expression
and the tattoos of the daggers through
his neck, which symbolise that he had
committed murder while imprisoned
and is available to hire for further assas-
sinations.
Within the criminal society tattoos
were used as a form of hierarchy, a man
bare of tattoos would be of the lowest
status whereas one adorned from head
to toe would be almost untouchable. he
temptation to boost your status by get-
ting unearned tattoos is therefore great.
However, considered a serious insult, if
found to be displaying ‘false’ tattoos you
would be beaten, raped and have them
forcibly removed.
Later, in 2003, a graphic design compa-
ny named FUEL brought both Daldaev
and Vasiliey’s work together and formed
a Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopae-
dia, made of three volumes. It displays all
the drawings and photographs collected
from the men’s joint obsession.
