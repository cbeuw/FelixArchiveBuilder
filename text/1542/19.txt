Losing My Religion
here is nothing more
liberating than simply
being yourself. here is
probably also nothing
harder. For many across
the UK struggling to leave their fam-
ily’s religion, this is exactly the chal-
lenge they face everyday. I know – I
was one of them.
Raised Catholic in Northern Ire-
land, religion was never sold to me
as a matter of conscience, it was a
matter of identity. To lose my faith
would be to lose a part of myself. So
when I started to doubt my faith as a
teenager and later again as a student,
I tried to sweep my doubts under the
carpet, embarrassed that someone
might see what seemed to me a failure
to believe. All I had ever known was
Catholicism and I had learnt to view
atheism through Catholic eyes. To be
atheist, I believed, was to lose hope,
to lose morality and to lose purpose.
So at ﬁrst the realisation that I did not
believe the religion of my parents was
far from liberating: it felt like an ill-
ness.
So I sought a cure for my atheism.
I became heavily involved in Catholic
groups, attending mass twice a week
and going abroad on pilgrimage. I fo-
cussed on the parts of my religion I
did believe in, such as charity, and told
myself that belief in the rest would
surely come. I remember being on a
retreat, aged 19, with the intention of
ﬁnally deciding that I believed in God.
Looking back, it does seem incredible
that I would head to the countryside
with a religious group with the inten-
tion of believing in a God I wasn’t sure
existed. I spent the weekend reading
non-stop through Catholic apologet-
ics but yet again I could only agree
with the call to be a moral person and
even then felt things weren’t as black
and white as they were presented to
me. Eventually I realised that to be-
lieve would require not a book but a
leap of faith. To simply, blindly, ac-
cept what the Church said to be true.
I had to believe.
But I couldn’t. I couldn’t because I
didn’t. Catholicism went against my
beliefs, it went against who I was and
in truth I wasn’t a Catholic. his re-
alisation was not the liberation it is
for some; it was a grim acceptance.
But through chance, I heard of hu-
manism. Actually, I heard about it
through a priest who was criticising
it: “hey arrogantly wish to live good
lives without God.” hat sounded
perfect.
Very often at College we hear from
religious societies promoting con-
verts to their religion, but how often
do we hear from those we have left it?
his Tuesday the newly formed Impe-
rial Atheists, Secularists and Human-
ists Society is proud to host Alom
T
Shaha, born in Bangladesh and raised
in London in a Muslim family, to talk
about his experience as an “apostate”
as the author of he Young Atheist’s
Handbook. he purpose of the talk is
not to gloat at Islam, Muslims or at
any religion or religious people but to
provide a voice for those who, like a
younger Alom and a younger me, are
uncomfortable in their religion but
don’t feel able to express this.
Too often we hear only from the
fully convinced – the Richard Dawk-
inses and priests, rabbis and imams
of our world. he doubtful majority
deserve their voice too. hrough this
event I hope that the doubters might
begin to feel more comfortable in
their own shoes, knowing that there
are many more who share and have
shared this experience. here really
is nothing more liberating than being
yourself, here’s hoping more people
can experience this for themselves.
