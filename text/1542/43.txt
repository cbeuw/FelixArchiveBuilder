The rules, again: draw a single closed loop by vertically and horizontally joining the
dots so that the numbered squares are surrounded by the corresponding number
of lines.
Hashi Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.

Fill the cells with a
continuous line (the
“snake”) that does not
pass through a cell twice,
doesn’t intersect with it-
self, and passes through
all white boxes (but no
black boxes). The num-
bers show you how many
times the snake turns in
the corresponding row
or column. The snake
enters and exits the grid
at the shown points
(and only those points).
There’s a couple hints to
get you started.

This one’s hard...
The numbers
in each row
and column tell
you how many
groups of black
squares are in a
row or column,
as well as how
many black
squares each
group is made
up of. Filling in
the grid pro-
duces a pretty
picture, which
in turn pro-
duces points if
you send it in,
so get solving
