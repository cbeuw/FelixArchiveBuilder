ou may have seen the IC
Marrow team at Fresh-
ers’ Week sporting the
characteristic black t-
shirt with bold white
print. his resonates with the design
scheme of Anthony Nolan, a national
blood cancer charity, which surpris-
ingly few people seem to have heard
of. A big part of Marrow, a society that
exists in 40 universities including Im-
perial, is to raise awareness regarding
the work that Anthony Nolan does to
match stem cell or bone marrow do-
nors to blood cancer patients. he ul-
timate aim of Marrow Societies is to
raise funds to support the work of An-
thony Nolan, and to encourage people
to sign up to be on the donor register.
here are many things in life that
we take for granted or are ignorant
of if they do not address our con-
temporary personal needs. If I were
diagnosed with cancer and needed a
life-saving transplant I would expect
the infrastructure that could ﬁnd my
potential match to be in place and ef-
fective. And yet as my current healthy,
non-cancerous self, I had zero knowl-
edge about the origins of the donor
register or the organisation responsi-
ble for managing and expanding the
register until about a year ago…
he concept of a register was borne
in the early 1970s by a woman called
Shirley Nolan who was desperate
to ﬁnd a bone marrow donor for
her young son, Anthony. Anthony
was born with Wiscott Aldrich syn-
drome, a rare condition that left
his life dependent on a bone mar-
row transplant. At the time, matches
were made mainly through relatives
as it was only in 1973 that unrelated
donors began to be used. However,
there was no system in place to locate
a donor to match the patient at hand.
Anthony’s mother campaigned for
the creation of a bone marrow regis-
ter to do just this; although it was set
up in 1974, she lost her eight year old
son for lack of a match in 1979. he
connectedness inherent in transplant
procedures today is the legacy of a
young child and his visionary, loving
mother. Nine years later a team of stu-
dents formed the ﬁrst-ever Marrow
Society in the University of Notting-
ham in response to the loss of a friend
to leukaemia.
Cancer is a personal subject. Can-
cer evokes diﬀerent thoughts and as-
sociations in diﬀerent people, and so
I’m banking on you readers to forgive
me for inevitably sharing my own take
and experiences with the subject. I
was introduced to Anthony Nolan
through a scheme of theirs entitled
‘Register and Be a Lifesaver’, or R&Be,
for which I attended a training day at
the charity headquarters. he scheme
was instigated by Adrian Sudbury, a
young journalist whose life had been
transformed following a leukaemia di-
agnosis. hroughout the course of his
illness he relayed the details of his bat-
tles with cancer in an excruciatingly
honest way on an online blog, ‘Baldy’s
Blog’, which accumulated thousands
of readers all over the world. At the
training we were shown a clip of Adri-
an which followed the deterioration
of his health over time. We learned
how he had loved to play football,
how he had dreamed of becom-
ing a big-time journalist,
and how his life as he
had known it had
stopped after
he had
checked
himself
into hos-
pital upon
feeling in-
credibly tired
one day whilst
washing the dishes.
Had you been there,
you would have noticed
the pace of the background
music slowing down and the
frames losing colour and movement
in a build-up to what you are primed
to know is a tragic ending. At that
point I remember looking over to the
speaker who, moments later, exposed
himself as Adrian’s father. here was
a mutual respect in the room, a room
which seemed to purge this man of his
deep sorrow and regret for the time
he was up there speaking about his
footballer-journalist-cancerous son.
He was doing everything in his power
to educate people about blood can-
cers and what they could do to help
on behalf of his deceased son who had
made promotion of public education,
particularly teenagers, his dying mis-
sion.
Humbling experiences lead us to re-
ﬂect upon the value and signiﬁcance
of our own philosophies of life and
our actions; of our littleness in the
grand scheme of life; and of our vul-
nerability to unpredictable external
forces. his causes us to better appre-
ciate any opportunities we do have to
control and impact not only our
own lives but those around us
in need of extra support.
If I haven’t appealed to
your sense of altruism
by now I can only sug-
gest you get out of
the lab more often
– oh, the joys
of drawing on
Imperial ste-
reotypes! To
the rest of
you I pro-

Hyde Park. he theme is superheroes
but for those of us who cannot bring
ourselves to presume the identity of a
ﬁctional character, normal sports at-
tire will suﬃce. here is a choice of
route, the shorter of which, sitting
here grease-stained from my Roast
Chicken Walkers, I feel truly thankful
for. To the pragmatics, a former par-
ticipant commented, “If, like
me, your outdoor
r u n n i n g
takes a slight
dip over the winter, and
you’re just starting to pick it up
again, this is well worth adding to your
calendar”. And for the competitors,
the fastest times and best dressed will
receive prizes. Last year these were
laptops and iPods! For those who just
want hard evidence to rub in the face
of the haters who doubted that they
could run a marathon, everyone re-
ceives a goody bag and medal. And
lastly, for those self-con-
scious of looking like a
one-legged duck
or other
form of
non-human in
the process of endurance
sport, there are opportunities to mar-
shall for a couple of hours.
he Marrow maxim is, ‘as long as
blood cancer is still around, we have
to make people aware that they can
cure it’. For every one person Anthony
Nolan can provide a donor for, there
is one person who misses out on a
second chance at life. Together we can
change these odds. We can leave our
footprint on cancer survival.
