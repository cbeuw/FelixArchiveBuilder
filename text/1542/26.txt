FRIDAY 01 MARCH 27
The Imperial
Fringe puts on a
banging show
What happens when two worlds
collide? This is the question Im-
perial Fringe attempted to answer
last Thursday, when they put on
The Arts Experiment, a series of
exhibits exploring the close links
between art and science. By ex-
plaining the science between many
of Imperial’s favourite pastimes
the organisers were able to show
that the worlds of culture and re-
search were a lot closer than many
of us may think.
At the heart of the event lay
Imperial’s student societies, who
teamed up with researchers in or-
der to answer thought-provoking
questions such as “How do danc-
ers keep their balance?” This ques-
tion was answered by neurologist
Dr. Barry Semmungal, who meas-
ured the brain activity of members
of both IC Dance Society and IC
Rowing in response to spinning in
circles. It turns out that dancing
had led to the brain adapting to
conditions that might cause dizzi-
ness. Who knew?
Although these questions may
not seem like the basis of vital
scientific research, one of the
beauties of the event was how it
showed that attempting to answer
such simple questions has led to
many fascinating scientific discov-
eries. And the exhibition did not
just deal with scientific research.
Both the IC String Society, and the
Chamber Music Society explored
the physics behind music, show-
ing us how vibrations in a cello’s
strings can translate into a beauti-
ful melody. This explanation of the
science behind the arts exemplifies
how closely the two are linked. It
needn’t be one or the other.
The arts can be an extremely
useful medium for getting the
public more interested in science,
a proposition currently being ex-
plored by Beautiful Science, which
promotes collaboration between
artists and biomedical research-
ers. Developments in biomedical
science, particularly in imaging
technologies, has led to incredibly
stunning images coming out of the
research lab, which can then be
used to encourage people to read
about the sciences. Their exhibit
included not only pieces of art,
but also gave visitors the chance
to create their own through paper
marbling, which relies on the spe-
cial properties of inks and paints.
Fred Fyles Writer While my own attempt was a far
cry from Picasso or Pollock, the
display showed how science can
help the artist create gorgeous im-
ages.
Other displays showed us that,
thanks to cutting edge scientific
research, the future is now. The
Music Technology Society were
exhibiting the Retractable, a mu-
sical table that produced sounds
depending on which blocks were
placed upon its surface. Such de-
velopments help us explore how
music may be produced in the fu-
ture, as computers become more
and more integral to the arts; just
over a year ago Icelandic musician
Björk released Biophilia, which
features a series of apps exploring
the subjects of the songs, making
it the world’s first ‘app album’. The
way music is being made is chang-
ing, and the Fringe shows us just
how exciting the developments
can be.
Personally, my favourite exhibit
was Nao, a dancing robot who was
clothed in spray-on textiles by IC
Fashion Society. Its balance may
have been a bit precarious, but
Nao was able to both dance on its
own, and copy the dance moves
of the audience, making for some
amusing interactions. The spray-
on clothing, developed at Imperial
College, was also particularly in-
teresting, as it displayed a technol-
ogy that has an enormous potential
both in fashion and in medicine.
Its use in design is something that
could become more and more pop-
ular in the coming years.
We are currently living within a
political climate where the arts are
under attack. As the government
tries to reduce the deficit, their
first targets for austerity measures
are often culture and the arts, with
some councils cutting arts funding
completely. These actions, com-
bined with the increased focus on
getting students interested in sci-
ence, have led to a culture in which
arts and science are often seen as
competitors. This should not be
the case.
Imperial Fringe have shown us
just how much these two worlds
can have in common, and how vital
the arts can be as a source of inspi-
ration for science. If the govern-
ment’s radical measures continue,
we could soon be left in a world
where culture no longer flour-
ishes, and this Arts Experiment
has shown us some of the amazing
things we could miss out on.
here is an underground space near
Baker Street that feels a lot like a
baroque sci-ﬁ future. he half-light
is illuminated by occasional ﬂashes
of neon. Blue and green lasers strafe
the ceiling and an eerie soundscape
of ambient electronic squawks and
whirring servos greets the intrepid.
Skulls in mechatronic legs stalk the
space and glowing orbs shimmer
with undulating constellations of
colour.
he Kinetica Art Fair, now in its
ﬁfth incarnation is dedicated to some
often underrated genres: kinetic,
electronic and new media art. he
fair often features the work of design
students or reformed engineers, well
placed to respond to societies accel-
erating mutability, which stems from
the insatiable advance of technol-
ogy. Where philosophical depth was
lacking the pure visual thrill of the
robots, holograms and illusions that
pack the space are sure to at least tit-
illate.
Like many commercial shows there
are hits and misses. he big names,
showcased at the entrance like Simon
Gudgeon and Titia Ex are, as is often
the case, the least rewarding. How-
ever hidden in dark corners there are
a number of pieces that succeed ei-
ther through craft or design.
One big theme of the show is in-
teraction. For example, in an in-
stallation by David John Roswell,
viewers are invited to remotely ma-
nipulate puppets though their own
body movements. Rainbow Winter’s
fashion pieces make use of a new
wave of smart textiles that respond
to their environments. One of her
two dresses on display is covered in
streaks of lightning that dart across
the surface in response to ambient
sound. he eﬀect is faintly mesmer-
ising and has earned her increasing
and well deserved media attention
from the likes of Wired and Channel
4.
When viewers are not being in-
vited to take part in the works, they
are often being tricked. he obses-
sion with optical illusion can be
seen everywhere. One mindboggling
piece, Die Falle, from Gregory Barsa-
mian makes reference to Karl Jung’s
theories on dreams. His huge zoe-
trope dominates the space around
it, making use of a strobe light and
a rotating frame to produce a seem-
ing impossible 3D illusion of a dream
sequence.
Chris Levine’s work Angel is one
of the most apparently unassuming.
Utilising the ‘persistent visual echo
of blipvert technique’ the viewer is
treated to glimpses of a ﬁgure emerg-
ing, seemingly magically, from your
peripheral vision of a simple strip
light. he phenomenon is so alien
that it really does momentarily shake
belief in the tangible in a profoundly
disturbing manner.
he show runs all this weekend and
will also feature scheduled perfor-
mance pieces. If the show by INERE
is anything to go by, these will com-
prise of baffling medleys of abstract
digital sound and audio.
I feel it should be mentioned that,
at the press viewing, the techno-
wizardry of many of the pieces was
too often interrupted by overloaded
power supplies, spasticated robot-
ics and the faint smell of burning
ﬁlaments. Hopefully by the time the
show opens to the general public
these glitches will have been ironed
out and you too can make the trip
to the depths of cybernetic madness
unafraid.
