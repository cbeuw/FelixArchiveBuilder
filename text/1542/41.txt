n a shock announcement to-
day, Imperial College London
have announced that they will
employ people to work as slave
drivers in the Library. he an-
nouncement comes after Imperial
released the results of a study of two
pupils that they once pretended to do.
After plummeting in the NSS
scores, Imperial has decided that it is
now ‘time to just except everyone is
fucking miserable, and just run with
it’. he slave drivers, fully equipped
with loincloths and a lack of respect
for people who work hard, will be just
the tip of the iceberg. Other plans in-
clude still not looking into the heat
in the Library, spitting on students
as they walk out of labs, and mak-
ing sure computers never connect to
printers.
In a shocking twist of events, the
halls at North Acton turned out to
just be part of a bigger ‘strategic re-
view’. A spokesperson said: “his is
a fantastic opportunity for Imperial.
We are now global leaders in the ﬁeld
of education, despite the fact that we
don’t give you useful feedback from
lab reports and projects” going on to
say that “improving those sorts of is-
sues would just be really silly”.
he plans are thought to be aimed
at distinguishing Imperial from UCL,
Rap Lyric of
the Week
“By all means,
I keep my balls clean”
By all means? There is only one
means, and that is basic personal
hygiene. Just have a shower every
day and you balls will be clean.
Plus, nobody wants to hear about
your scrotal cleansing regiment
when walking down the road with
their headphones in. Keep this shit
to yourself in the future.

Are you happy?
It is all too easy to twist and fold the
world into a sweet smelling version
of what it really is. A stolen moment
of intimacy can seem an incapsulat-
ing whirlwind of passion, desire, and
sexual supremacy. To an outsider,
however, things can appear a little
diﬀerently. You might, for example,
stumble into your ﬂatmates very own
whirlwind of passion not to see a cou-
ple pushing the boundaries of human
desire, but instead two greasy drunk-
en failures, who despite his valiant ef-
forts to thumb in a quarter-chub, ﬁnd
themselves so painfully alone. You
scan the room for a condom wrapper.
Nope. Poor kid hasn’t got a fucking
chance.
People insist on forever seeking the
most positive outlook on life, and yet
seem so bitterly disappointed when
things don’t work out as they ex-
pected. Reality is all too real for these
verity-phobes, who proudly march
onwards through the steaming piles
of shit that life endlessly throws at us
only to come out the other side won-
dering why they have a nasty taste in
their mouths.
We see this delusional behaviour
throughout society. Critics forever
ponce on about food, relentlessly pick-
ing apart a dish as if eating it is some
holy grail of human experience, rather
than what it is. Ingestion. he ﬁrst
chapter of a horrible book in which
the main character enters the damp
mouth-hole of a greedy machine, has
all the goodness sucked out of them,
passes through 5 sphincters and ends
up spinning down a ﬁlthy tube to join
the rest of their unfortunate comrades
deep within the steaming mess of
London’s Victorian sewer system.

could be heard from space. Why? Be-
cause in the book things are so much
more interesting than their actual,
miserable lives, and their husbands
are far more beige and pie-driven than
Christian Grey.
But fear not, mortals! For true hap-
piness can be found in reality. Accept
that things won’t always work out
as expected, and seek joy in the lit-
tle things. So the next time you’re on
your knees in a toilet cubicle, feeling a
stranger’s love juice burning the back
of your throat and wondering how
the fuck it came to this, ask yourself –
does it really taste so bitter?
If semen be the food of love, eat on. As Shakespeare
almost said or something
hey probably don’t take hygiene too
seriously. hen again, that goes for
most Imperial people. hey presume
it will be a ‘conversation starter’ or
some other drivel. he clue here is that
they feel that they are so unspeakably
dull that they need something to re-
mind them how to make conversation.
“Oh hi I went to watch a band that ac-
tually only made one song I like in a
muddy ﬁeld in England”. Not exactly
going to get the heart pumping with
excitement and sexual attraction, is it.
Most likely they will attempt to tell
you over-exaggerated and usually
made up stories about how wild it was
when they went. If they are wearing a
Reading and Leeds wristband then as-
sume that they are either 16 or just a
bit slow.
Some are repeat oﬀenders. You’ll see
a few (usually male, let’s be honest)

don’t regularly regret their degree and

Critics of the move say that hap-

top priority. However, they were dis-
missed by College as “just the sort
of backward thinking that causes
students to love their university and
enjoy life”.

It’s your own funeral if you indulge
