FRIDAY 01 MARCH

A feast of arts on campus
rom the 18th to the 21st
of February, ArtsFest re-
turned for Imperial’s an-
nual showcase of music,
dance, drama and every-
thing in between. he South Kensing-
ton campus came alive for four days of
the best arts events that our student
groups have to oﬀer, showing the vast
array of talent hidden amongst our
scientists, engineers and medics.
he week kicked oﬀ in style, with
Big Band playing a superb set from the
balcony of the Queen’s Tower. Much
to the surprise and delight of passers-
by, the sheer volume of their upbeat
jazz sound kept everyone entertained
over their lunch, with “Mercy, mercy,
mercy” and other classic charts bring-
ing many students out of the Library
and out into the glorious sunshine.
Monday evening saw a new and in-
credibly popular event on the ArtsFest
calendar: a dance showcase and cei-
lidh. Belly Dancing opened the even-
ing with a variety of routines, before
a pair from the Dance Society wowed
the crowds with their slick display.
Dance Company were up next, and
showed just why they have won so
many awards of late, with stunning
routines from contemporary and tap
right through to ballet. he night
wasn’t just about watching the grace
and poise of our dancers’ talent how-
ever; Caledonian Society, with help
from String Ensemble, led the audi-
ence participation in a raucous ceilidh
well into the night.
here’s no rest in ArtsFest week, and
Tuesday saw another packed schedule
of events. Wind Band held an open re-
hearsal inviting everyone to hear prep-
arations for their upcoming American
themed concert whilst LeoSoc and
Photosoc launched their exhibit in the
Blyth Gallery with a drinks reception.
Back in the Union building, Imperial
Cinema held a well attended and hi-
larious ﬁlm quiz night, capably won by
“Les Quizerables” (though DramSoc
beating Cinema at their own quiz was
undoubtedly also a highlight!).
Wednesday brought another open
rehearsal, this time from two of our
biggest societies, Symphony Orches-
tra and Choir. In preparation for their
upcoming concert at Cadogan Hall
(2nd March, tickets on sale now at
cadoganhall.com!) the clubs opened
their doors for listeners to get a sneak
preview of their collaboration on Ra-
chmaninov’s “he Bells”, and the sheer
strength and power of their perfor-
mance was incredible. Meanwhile in
the Union Concert Hall, two of our
ﬁnest vocal societies, A Cappella and
Musical heatre, presented A Very
Vocal Evening. he Scopes kicked oﬀ

Imperielles presented a great cover of
“Take Me or Leave Me”. he stage was
set for Imperial favourites The Tech-
tonics to deliver another ﬂawless per-
formance, followed by Musical hea-
tre giving a sneak preview of their next
show Parade. A selection of dazzling
solos from members of all societies
built up to some huge joint numbers –

he week
was lead-
ing up to the
showpiece,
which was
a collabora-
tion between the Imperial Festival
Fringe and ArtsFest centring around
the interplay between science and arts.
An eclectic collection of societies and
Imperial researchers worked together
for a public outreach event celebrating
the science behind a variety of crea-
tive media. Dancing robots clothed
in spray-on fabric costumes designed
by the Fashion Society sat alongside
a display from Juggling showing the
neuroscience behind multi-tasking.
Music Technol-
ogy displayed the
“Reactable” from
Electronic Engi-
neering and drew
the biggest crowds
of the evening, al-
lowing visitors to
generate electronic
music from visual
blocks. Chamber
Music demon-
strated the spatial
patterns that sound
waves make whilst
String Ensemble
explained the phys-
ics behind their in-
struments. hrough
the middle of all of
this, Dance Society
and Caledonian Society lead guests
in more dance displays, this time with
input from the Faculty of Medicine on
how balance aﬀects dancers and a cu-
rious link to insect behaviour.
At the end of the night, the Fringe
Afterparty in Metric featured an-
other excellent set from Big Band (in
more comfortable surroundings on
the ground this time) and the evening
closed with superb DJ sets from mem-
bers of Music Technology. Performers
and participants from throughout the
week joined the ArtsFest team for a
well-deserved drink as they reﬂected
upon the most successful ArtsFest in
recent memory.
