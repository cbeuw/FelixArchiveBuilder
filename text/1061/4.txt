Suicide attempt by jilted boyfriend
BY ROBIN RILEY
An ambulance and two lire-
engines were called to Tizard
Hall in Princes Gardens on
Saturday night following the
attempted suicide ol a female
resident's ex-boyfriend. The
presence of so many emergency
vehicles worried a number of
Southside residents into thinking
that there had been a major fire
in the building.
The couple had reportedly
been in a relationship for two-
and-a-half years before splitting
up, at her instigation, nine
months ago. They are not
thought to have spoken for the
last eight months, although the
boyfriend is believed to have
unsuccessfully attempted to re-
establish communication through
a series of letters.
Events came to head on
Saturday when the boyfriend
entered Tizard Hall at around
7pm, in a state of some distress,
and pleaded with the female resi-
dent for a reconciliation. When
this finally proved to be of no
avail the young man, who is not
an Imperial College student,
attempted to take his own life by
swallowing a large number of
tablets, possibly a mixture of
paracetamol and sleeping pills.
He is also thought to have been
drinking heavily beforehand.
At this point the young
woman left the room and alerted
Tizard subwarden Colleen Lee,
who in turn contacted College
security and Tizard Hall's
Warden, Dr John Hassard of the
physics department.
Ms Lee and Dr Hassard then
administered emergency detoxi-
fying treatment using powdered
graphite before the arrival of the
emergency services. Following
further intensive treatment by
ambulance crewmen and in
hospital that night, the patient
was pronounced 'out of danger'
at around L30am on Sunday
morning. He discharged himself
later that afternoon.
As an additional precaution,
the young man, whom has not yet
been named, is to receive coun-
selling in order to help him
recover from his obsession and
the events of Saturday night.
Although Southside Halls
were evacuated after a fire alarm
which sounded during the inci-
dent, widespread rumours that
the man tried to set fire to his ex-
girlfriend and her room are
untrue. There had been sugges-
tions that the man had brought
two petrol cans into the hall with
him. The emergency services sent
two fire-engines around half an
hour later.
This incident comes just 18
months after a suicide attempt in
Selkirk Hall, of which John
Hassard is also Warden. Speaking
to Felix, Dr Hassard commended
Ms Lee on her prompt action,
and pointed out that the Tizard
Hall Subwardens were already in
a heightened state of awareness
to the presence of intruders
following a series of thefts from
the Hall's games machines.
Furniture in the Selkirk Hall tele-
vision lounge was vandalised last
weekend.
Dr Hassard went on to say:
"This is a very sad story... It is sad
how someone can become
obsessed in this way. We must all
be vigilant of strangers, and
remember that there is no secu-
rity in Halls except for that that
the students provide them-
selves." •
The incident has once again
raised questions over the security
of students in Halls, and their
vulnerability to intruders creep-
ing into the buildings. How an
obviously drunk person without
identification was allowed into
the Hall has not yet been
resolved.
