To All
Tenants...
If you will soon be moving out of
private rented accommodation,
you might expect to get your
deposit back. If your landlord
refuses to return it, or makes
what you consider to be unrea-
sonable deductions, then you
should take action to recover it.
If you feel that your landlord
has behaved badly in any way,
and you obtained your accommo-
dation via the Accommodation
Office, it is very important that
you lodge a written complaint
with them. These will be held on
file, available for future students

to view. If a number of serious
complaints accumulate against
any particular landlord then he or
she will be prevented from
advertising on the lists and
noticeboard. If these landlords go
unreported then this cycle will
simply repeat.
The only way to get back
deposits which have been illegal-
ly retained is to sue the landlord
in the small claims court. This is
a lot less complicated and expen-
sive than you may think. Please
contact the accommodation
office or the Union Adviser on
x48067 if you want to discuss
any problems you may have.
