film: the confessionalnny h<
The Confessional starts with Pierre Lamontagne
(Lothaire Bluteau) returning to Quebec in 1989
to attend the funeral of his father, Paul-Emile,
who died blind after neglecting his diabetes. He
meets up with his
adopted brother Marc,
an illegitimate child who
has begun to question
his identity. Together,
the brothers embark on
a quest to find out who
Marc's father really is.
The film switches
back and forth between
modern day and the
1950s, often within a
single shot which con-
veys the power that the
past exerts over the pre-
sent.
In 1952, Alfred
Hitchcock is shooting /
Confess in the parish
church in Quebec City,
where Paul-Emile is
working nights as a taxi
driver. He and his wile
Francoise share a house
with Rachel, Francoises sixteen year-old sister.
Rachel works in the presbytery of the parish
church and is pregnant. Filled with shame, she
seeks salvation in the confessional and, trusting to
the vow of silence, makes a confession to a young
priest who is suspected to be the father.
A senior civil servant seems to hold the key
to the confession and the truth surrounding
Marc's birth. Past and present fit together like a
jigsaw puzzle and reveal
clues to the audience as
they watch a family
tragedy and a mystery
unfold.
The Confessional is a
British, French and
Canadian co-produc-
tion-part produced by
David Puttnam.
Lothaire Bluteau makes
for an unlikely leading
man material while
there are rare and brief
appearances by Kristin
Scott Thomas (Four
Weddings and a
Funeral) as the assistant
to Alfred Hitchcock.
The film starts slowly
but proceeds to tell an
intriguing tale. The
Confessional is challeng-
ing viewing and offers
the audience the opportunity to question how
sacred the word of confession should be. As an
art film, it is stimulating and thought provoking
without losing its entertaining aspect.

It is 6.30pm on Wednesday night. Five of us are
sitting at the back of a 300-strong audience in the
Lyttelton Theatre. Iain (Menzies) Banks has just
walked onto the stage, accompanied by Oliver
Morton, the U K editor of Wired magazine.
Wired ran an interview with Iain in their June
issue along with a preview extract from his new
novel Excession, lor which Iain is now doing the
book-signings and talks.
Since the new book is a science fiction novel
set in Iain's previously-visited galaxy of the
Culture, the topic of conversation centres
around the general ideas ol the Culture, as
opposed to the specifics ol a book which few of
the audience would yet have read.
The Culture is a Utopian "post-scarcity"
society of humanoids and machine intelligence.
Asked whether he would still describe it as 'anar-
chic-communism', he replies, "Only when I'm
talking to a load of right wing American writers,"
raising one of many laughs. Since it is Utopian,
stories set within typical every-day circum-
stances would be what Iain disparagingly calls
Hampstead novels'. Hence the novels take
place within the Culture's 'Contact section',
which interacts with other societies. In
Excession, the appearance of an object of tech-
nology superior to that of the Culture triggers
the machinations of various groups which form
the story. The machine intelligences are the main
protagonists here, and this new viewpoint on the
Culture is particularly welcome, seeing that it is
they who effectively mn the Culture.
After about 25 minutes the audience is
asked for questions. The first is a standard
"Films?" and the answer is more specific than I
have previously heard. The BBC are in the
process of filming The Crow Road, and the result
will be shown in the autumn. His more standard
answer follows - that Hollywood can have
Consider Phlebas, give it a happy ending and
stickArnie in as the hero - just so long as all those
great scenes are done!
The other main question is which authors
he personally reads. His first answer, describing
how as a teenager he would simply look around
the library for the yellow Victor Gollanz books,
struck a strong chord. When it came to more
recent specific books, I was not surprised at his
choice of Dan Simmonds' Hyperion. That has
one scene, involving satellites, personal commu-
nicators and a lot of gore which, on reading, I
thought, "Iain Banks could have written that!"
Iain has a further four-book deal, two SF
and two mainstream, which means I have at
least four books to lookforwardto over the next
five years.
