There's an awful lof you don't know about Trading Risk. But if you're
a fast learner with a strong analytical mind, after 12 months in Trading
Risk you will already have gained invaluable experience in a function
which is increasingly under the spotlight in the financial markets.
NatWest Markets (NWM) is the global corporate and investment
banking arm of NatWest Group - with 6,500 staff in 24 countries.
The more sophisticated our products become, the greater the
need to identify, quantify and control financial risk. This is a
global function, involving NWM's worldwide trading operations.
Fortunately, Trading Risk at NWM is one of the best respected
and most successful teams in the market and, because it supports
all product areas, offers maximum exposure to
NWM's full range of trading activities.
To maintain and ideally strengthen our market
leadership, we must recruit numerate graduates
of the highest calibre. People who can fit into a N A T W E S T M A R K E T S
dynamic environment. People who can think on their feet and
develop sophisticated skills in areas such as computer modelling.
People who can work closely with the dealing desks to ensure that
risks on even the most complex derivative products are
comprehensively modelled and analysed.
To qualify, you must have gained - or expect to gain - at least
a 2:1 in a Maths, Science, Economics or Engineering discipline.
But analytical ability and numeracy is not enough; you must be
able to explain your thinking clearly both within your close-knit
team and to a wider and diverse audience.

Trading Risk at NWM, please send your CV
