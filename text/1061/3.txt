continued from front p;t^r
than grind their axe," and bull-
ishly said, "Let them do what
they like, I would prefer not to
have to do two jobs." Defending
his career move, Mr Karrian
insisted that the had "done more
work in ten months than any of
my predecessors did in twelve."
Lie seemed unconcerned by
the threat to his position.
Quoting Margaret Thatcher,
whom he describes as 'his hero',
he said, "I fight, I fight on, I fight
to win." However, support for
Ghassan seems thin on the
ground. Kate Hampton, the
London School of Economic
Union's General Secretary, said
that she and her delegates would
be supporting the move to
censure Ghassan at the very least,
saying that most colleges are
"extremely angry at Ghassan."
Mr Karian's defection to
another job so quickly after the
ULU elections has been
described as "cynical" in some
quarters. Many suggest that he is
putting unreasonable pressures
on his successors, while others
suggest that the implications if he
has to completely break links
with ULU are even worse. These
fears could be behind the tabling
of a motion of confidence by
Claire Lawrie of LSE, one of next
year's ULU sabbatical officers.
With particular reference to
the ICU support for the no-
confidence motion, Mr Karian
complained that he hadn't been
given a chance to defend himself
at the Council meeting where the
GUC delegates were mandated
to back it. He said that "justice
wasn't done," because the dele-
gates are now obliged to vote
against him regardless. The
comment holds particular irony
for QMW, as Ghassan criticised
their NUS delegates for going
against a mandate by not support-
ing Ghassan's New Solutions
movement at the NUS confer-
ence earlier this year.

at a recent
3 year ban for Iran Soc A D V E R T I S E M E N T
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Imperial's Iranian society have
been banned from having any
large scale speaker meetings after
an unauthorised event last month
turned into a security incident.
They will not be allowed to
organise events on IC premises
for three years.
The society booked the
Clore lecture theatre in the
Huxley building via Imperial
College Union and IC's confer-
ence centre. Authorisation was
given for an internal event lor
100 people on May 30th, but the
meeting attracted well over 300
people, arousing the suspicion of
the local police. IC Estates
Director Ian Caldwell and ICU
President Sarah White were
called to the scene.
Only around fifty of the
audience were Imperial students
or staff. College staff were
particularly concerned that the
event had been advertised
outside Imperial: the promo-
tional leaflets, written in Farsi,
were clearly designed for non-IC
students, giving directions from
South Kensington Station. "They
say that someone else organised
the advertising, but if they can't
control it they can't be trusted to
run events," Sarah said. "They've
shown that they're incapable of
organising an event properly."
The speaker, Dr Abdul
Karim Sonosh, a well-known
Iranian philosopher, is known to
Scotland Yard. The organiser
allegedly claimed that, because
Dr Sonosh hadn't been in Iran
for 10 years, he didn't realise
how famous he was.
Although the franian Society
will not be able to organise any
more large scale events,
Professor Alan Swanson, Pro
Rector (Educational Quality)
explained that there was "no
intention of stopping the organi-
sation from having internal meet-
ings of their Imperial College
members," The ban, which came
after discussions between the Pro
Rector, College security and
ICU, has been extended to cover
ICU's Beit Quad premises as
well as the Conference centre
meeting areas.
The ICU executive decided
on Tuesday to allow the society
to appeal against the decision
from November 1997,
