pilings in the Serpentine, should
be finished in time for the
summer, and has provided an
interesting spectacle f o r
customers at the Lido.
The Cafe has also under-
gone an extensive refurbishment
since last season, changing into a

In order to minimise the
disruption to study during the
building work, loan allowances
will be extended, permitting
students to borrow more books
so they can study elsewhere.
The plans are on display in
the library, and further informa-

Another bill from
the VAT man
Imperial College could face a
extra VAT bill of as much as
Â£40,000 annually after a ruling
this week. An exemption clause
which meant that charitable
institutions, including universi-
ties, didn't have to pay VAT on
staff recruitment advertising has
been revoked.
Only last year Imperial's
staff newspaper, The IC
Reporter, ran a competition to
find an appropriate VAT slogan.
But the slogan: At the leading
edge oj research, innovation and
learning will no longer be enough
to give IC exemption from tax
bills.
Jazz & rock mystery
Concerns over the safety of the
Jazz and Rock club's equipment
came to a head this week when a
large power amplifier was
reported missing.
The amplifier had not been
seen for a couple of weeks before
its disappearance was noted, as
the Jazz and Rock club's chair-
man wasn't available to confirm
that it actually existed. The
chairman, Stefan Finch, has been
studying for exams recently and
has not been able to attend to the
club, which has cast doubts on
the club's accountability.
The Social and Cultural
Amusements Board, under
whose authority Jazz and Rock
falls, received two queries as to
the whereabouts of the equip-
ment. Mr Finch was able to iden-
tify what was missing at a meet-
ing on Tuesday.
SCAB executive officers
have been worried lately over the
Jazz and Rock club, as the soci-
ety's organisation seems opaque.
Also, since Jazz and Rock club
officers have been unable to
attend SCAB meetings recently,
there has been a lack of response
to members concerns. As Felix
went to press, there have been no
reports as to the whereabouts of
the amplifier.
Lecturers against
loans
At its conference last week, the
lecturers' union Natfhe voted
against the Labour party shift
from student grants to loans.
Reflecting the growing militancy
in university teachers worried
about job security, the union has
decided to set up a 'battle plan'
to lobby against continuing job
cuts in the higher eduaction
sector. They plan to set up a
strike fund to cover possible
industrial action by lecturers.
