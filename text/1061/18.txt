Dear Felix,
As a resident in Weeks Hall
disturbed by the noise last week
I noted with interest that Ian
Caldwell and indeed the editor
herself were surprised that we
did not complain first to our
warden about the racket.
It should be noted that
"our" warden seems to have
more interest in staying on the
right side of the "powers that be"
than student welfare; his
supreme indifference to Hall res-
idents is well known.
In short, those complaining
did not speak to the warden
since they felt their complaints
would be greeted with "blank
wall" diplomacy or the usual
derisory arrogance.
How can we go through the
proper channels when those
channels are not open to us?

Oh, and I was doing so well too.
Optimism, positive thinking,
constructive thought... Well, cer-
tainly a spot less cynicism, which
is pretty good going for me. But
not any more.
Firstly I'm really disappoint-
ed about the Rector's Town and
Gown summer reception. I had
been completely charmed by Ian
Caldwell's story: he was really
sorry about disturbing the Weeks
students, but hey, we had their
best interests at heart, we
thought they'd like somewhere
quiet and peaceful outside to
revise in. Somewhere peaceful to
revise in, my foot. 400 members
of the Knightsbridge Association
for tea, that's what.
Besides, I wasn't invited. It's
utterly unreasonable: there you
are, elected for position to the
1995-96 IC students' union sab-
batical team, all getting abuse
from the drunk medics together.
Where are we now? Sarah White
gets to go to the Rector's Town
and Gown summer reception,
and I get to spend all night sta-
pling whilst getting hate mail
from disgruntled Security
Guards.
And while we're on the the
subject of Student Union
Presidents, I am entirely sick of
the political machinations of
Ghassan Karian. This man may
have two important sounding
jobs. He may be the chief
General Election Campaigns
Coordinator for West London
for the Labour Party. He may be
the figurehead of the largest stu-
dent body in the country. But he
clearly has difficulty filling his
time. Alex Feakes phoned up
Kate Hampton (the LSE
President) to ask about their anti
no-confidence motion (or some-
thing like that). A couple of
hours later, and all hell had bro-
ken loose: Kate had told Ghassan
who called Sarah who passed the
call on to me to say that she said
that he said that she said that he
said that you're going to write a
nasty article about me. Well I
certainly will now, mate. It is my
considered opinion that the
University of London Union is an
utter waste of time. A great
venue, yes, a centre for student
advice/welfare/travel certainly,
but as a body of student opinion
it is made entirely irrelevant by
the autonomy of its constituent
colleges.
Or, to put it another way, I
am a little concerned that the
Student Union Presidents of
LSE, Imperial and the University
of London (amongst others) have
nothing better to do than decide
whether they have confidence in
each other.
