Although ICU has been unable
to gain funding for a full-scale
employment service, we will be
proceeding with a scaled-down
version for now. Vacancies with-
in the Union, College and the
surrounding area will be adver-
tised on a noticeboard outside
the Union Office.
We will be focussing on
part-time and holiday vacancies,
and if anyone knows of any
vacancies that our students
could fill, please contact
Michelle in the Union Office,
extension 48060.

Visas
As reported in the Advice
Centre Newsletter, the Home
Office had introduced compul-
sory application forms for any-
one wishing to extend or vary
their leave to remain from June
3rd. On June 5th, faced with
legal action to judicially review
their use (following concerns
about the the new system) they
decided to withdraw them.
For the time being, the orig-
inal process can be followed but
the Home Office intend to re-
issue improved compulsory
forms soon, so if you need to
extend your visa over the sum-
mer and plan to do so by post,
please ensure that you are fol-
lowing the correct procedure.
If you need more inforam-
tion or advice on the subject,
Martin Thomson, the Union
advisor, can be contacted via the
ICU office or by calling exten-
sion 48067.
In true Carol Vorderman style,
the countdown has begun for the
biggest, sunniest Carnival of the
year. Yes, we're only a fortnight
away from the Summer Carnival
and it's going to be a monster]
As you come in you'll be
treated to a free glass of Archers
and lemonade, serenaded by a
string quartet from the My Life
Story Orchestra, entertained by
uni-cycling fire jugglers and faced
with the Barbecue - before
you've even entered the building!
On the ground floor Da
Vinci's and the Union Bar are
open until 2am and the Ents
Lounge will be buzzing with
poppy sounds from the Pop
Tarts. Live music is supplied by
Succulent and the excellent
Showgirls who make lots of
Sleeper-type noises and make
Pulp look like shy retiring types.
Don't forget that this is your very
last chance to 'enjoy' the, er,
'unique ambience' of the Ents
Lounge as it is.
The Union Dining Hall will
be the coolest (literally) place to
hang out with top chill-out
sounds washing over you, and
those very nice Malibu people

Bar Trivia - end of term total
trivia spectacular] The first prize

top text books off next year's

ners up - you'd be mad to miss
money this easy] What agreat
start to the hols]

t u e s d a y
are supplying a very special range
of cocktails, plus freebies.
If you venture to the 2nd
floor you'll find out where the
serious noise is being made. In
the gym you'll find the famous
Channel One Reggae Sound
System. In the Concert Hall the
PoodleChaos crew will be giving
it loads of hardhouse and techno
with live sounds from James
Hockley. The room will be fully
decked out with the return of
the seven-colour laser, and for
the un-superstitious of you
there'll even be a tarot reader.
To make it all a bit special,
the whole building will be deco-
rated by PropArt in a summer
stylee with drapes and fluores-
cent bees and butterflies
throughout the building]
All of this is just £5, or £4
with an entscard, tickets are sell-
ing fast already from the Union
Office & DaVinci's, so get yours
now] Tickets sold out 2 days in
advance last year, so don't leave
it too late.
