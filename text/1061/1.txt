'No confidence' vote for Ghassan
BY ALEX FEAKES
The future of University of
London Union's president,
Ghassan Karian, hangs in the
balance pending a no confidence
vote next Tuesday. The ULU
General Union Council will meet
to discuss a motion tabled by the
Queen Mary and Westfield
College sabbatical team, which
raises concern over his new posi-
tion as a Labour party Campaigns
coordinator.
Mr Karian has raised the ire
of many of the colleges in London
by prematurely leaving his ULU
post to take up employment else-
where. Although Mr Karian has
taken up a full time position, he
has not resigned his ULU presi-
dency, the contract of which is
due to run until the end of July.
The first of two motions
tabled seeks to censure Mr
Karian for his involvement in the
New Solutions lobby group. The
movement won a recent victory
with the reversal of the NUS's
policy of campaigning to return
student grants to 1979 levels.
The second proposes a vote of no
confidence in the ULU presi-
dent, a move that Imperial
College Union's delegates to the
GUC have been mandated to
support.
If the motion of no confi-
dence is passed, Mr Karian will
have been effectively sacked,
leaving unfinished the ULU work
which he has continued to do.
Additionally, he would no longer
be required to be present during
the ULU sabbaticals handover
period when the incoming offi-
cers are trained. This could jeop-
ardise the training of ICU
President Sarah White, who was
elected as next year's ULU pres-
ident last month.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Karian
was in a unrepentant mood: "I
could have walked away from
ULU, |but| I've been at govern-
ment committees, finance meet-
ings, a million and one meetings,
unpaid." He said QMWs Union
officers were "petty politicians,
who have nothing better to do

Security swoops on bikes
BY ROBIN RILEY
Students cycling to the Chem-
istry and Biochemistry depart-
ments on Tuesday were stunned
to find that bikes previously
attached to railings outside the
buildings had been summarily
removed by Security, with little
warning.
The bikes removed had
apparently been unused for some
time and were considered a fire
hazard by Security. When asked
about the relative flammability
of a pair of bicycles as compared
to the chemistry department
itself, Ken Weir, IC's head of
Security, refused to be drawn, he
claimed that the bikes were
attached too close to the main
doors and would hinder escape
from the buildings in an emer-
gency.
At the time of going to press,
no-one has come forward to
claim the bikes. When asked if
the missing owners would be able
to reclaim their D-Locks, Mr
Weir refused to comment,
instead stating "I would prefer
people to use the bicycle racks
provided in future."
Library as planned
With considerably greater ease
than for the BMS building, plan-
ning permission for the library
extension has been granted first
time. Westminster Council gave
the go-ahead last week. Page 2
Tizard suicide alert
Emergency services were called
to Tizard Hall in response to an
attempted suicide by an ex-
boyfriend of a resident. The
Subwarden and Warden admin-
istered aid to the man. Page 4
Iranian Society ban
Imperial College's Iranian
Society has been banned from
having meetings of more than 20
people for the next three years
following an incident last week
in the Huxley building. Page 3
