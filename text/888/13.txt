With Felix and Warner Bros you can.
Win! Win! Win!
Well 'ard!
2. The second competition is for those of
you who can't answer all the questions.
All you have to do is write down either
the reason that you couldn't answer the
questions, or the reason that you deserve
to w i n the videos, in not more than 300
words (but it can be much shorter, if you
really want). Best answer wins!
Da Rules
Answers must be handed in at the Felix
office in Beit Q u a d or sent to us via the
internal mail system, to be received

Yes! Y o u too can win F R E E S T U F F from
Felix, in conjunction with those wonderful
cuddly boys and girls from Warner
Brothers!! (We love them lots and lots!).
Felix and Warner Brothers are giving
you the chance to win not one, but two,
yes T W O videos, which would usually
stet you back nearly a tenner each! (RRP
£9.99). The films are Lethal Weapon 2,
and Last Tango in Paris (if you hadn't
guessed). There are three pairs to win, so
there are three competitions (there's a
kind of warped internal logic to it).
The Competitions
1. To w i n the first you have to answer
(correctly) the 8 questions below. The first
correct entry pulled out of a suitable
receptacle wins!
1. W h y did Last Tango in Paris cause
such a stir w h e n it was released in 1972?
2. What actor stars in it?
3. In what film did the actos from
question 2 play the lead role as a mafia
crime boss?
4. A sequel to the film from question 3 is
being released early this year. What is it
called?
5. W h o is a "Lethal Weapon"?
(The characters name)
6. What pistol does he use when not
killing people with his bare hands?
7. W h o co-stars in both Lethal Weapon
films?
(The actors name)
8. The actor from question 7 stars in the
sequel to a film released in 1985 which
starred a rather larger ex-body builder.
What is the title of this film, due out this
summer?
enter any or all of them, but you can
only win once. As usual, the editors
decision is final, and no correspondence
will be entered into, except to tell the
Well naughty!
3. The last competition is for those of you
who can't answer the questions, or can't
be bothered to use your imaginations,
and especially for anybody who loves
knocking Felix. It's the new editor's first
issue, and he's made some cock-ups
(surprise!). A l l you have to do is spot as
many of these as possible (nottypos), and
list them. Most spotted wins!
winners that they've won, blah, blah.
Winners and their answers will be printed
next week. G o o d Luck.
Crossword
Well, they're here! Yes, the answers to
(and winner of) last terms crossword
competition! Unfortunately, the Chrimbo
gremlins had been at work, and there
were a couple of mistakes. Ooops. Firstly,
there should have been a black square to
the immediate bottom left of square 15.
Also, one of the clues was wrong!
Answers
Despite this, we do have a winner, who
guessed that there should be the
aforementioned black square, and
completed the crossword as far as was
possible. The lucky winner of £20 is:
J. H A R R I S O N , Info Systems Eng II
Well done, and come to the office to
