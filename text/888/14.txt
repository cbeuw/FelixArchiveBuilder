Gig Review 6.12.90
Petroleum Spirit opened up well, with a
captivating but all too short instrumental
set, showing off the considerable skills of
the guitarist and bassist in a variety of
styles from modern jazz to speedmetal,
taking on blues, mainstream metal and
some folk influences on the way. The
guitarist sometimes sounded like Eric
Clapton one moment and Yingwie of
Malmsteen the next. Every piece told a
storyon the emotional level, with no need
for lyrics. I hope they will be playing at
IC again.
The Heartbreak Anjels (their spelling
not mine) began their act as mundane
sleezemetal similar to Poison and
Cinderella. Soon after the beginning they
played a ballad but the singer couldn't
soften his voice enough to fit in with the •
music. They gradually got more lively as
they shifted style towards The Clash and
The Sex Pistols. But on the whole,
although they seemed to have impressed
the people w h o had come with them,
some others were still talking about
Petroleum Spirit.
Ski
Club
SEX—has nothing to do with this article,
but now we've got your attention, we'd
like to say skiing doesn't have m u c h to
do with it either. That's if last Saturday's
race is anything to go by.
Mind you, we did keep casualty busy,
with six thumbs, four knees, a neck, a
chest and a little finger (and there were
only ten of us!). These injuries resulted
from several spectacular wipeouts, while
the team were wearing their brand new,
bright pink, v e r y prominant, designer
sweatshirts.
W e w o n the wooden spoon which Kiera
promptly broke while trying to break
Gareth's ribs. By the end of the night
even the sppon was wearing a bandaid!
P.S. the lsts came seventh and the 2nds
came an extremely close joint nineteenth.

ICSF PRESENTS T R E M O R S
This film is easily the best terrestrial
monster movie i n the last ten years. Giant
worms are picking off the citizens of a
sleepy midwest town (no, honest) and
only the local odd job duo can save
them. Starring Kevin Flatliner Bacon and
John Henry and June/Dangerous Liaisons
Malcovich the film is funny, exciting,
scary, romantic, original and jolly spiffing
all round.
It on in Mech Eng 220 on Tuesday Jan
15. See What's O n page for further
details.
Great value a n d a stonking good film.

A n R C C Treasurer's meeting will now be
held at 12.30pm on Thursday in the Clubs
Committee Room.
Labour Club
For the first time in nearly ten years
there is a National Organisation of Labour
Students Group at IC.
W e had our first meeting on October 30
1990 and since then have had two further
meetings. At our last meeting we had
A n n Holmes, Labour's prospective
parliamentary candidate for Kensington
speaking.
Our membership keeps o n growing and
the clubs is going from strength to
strength. For next term a bit social event
is planned, we are organising a tour of
the Houses of Parliament, and we are
expecting a speaker from Labour's front
bench.
In the current political climate, with our
economy considered to be the weakest in
Europe, and the recent resignation of the
longest serving Prime Minister in this
country, there is much scope for
discussion into both rectifying the
economy and getting rid of the rest of
the Tory government.
A l o n g with the political side of the club,
there is a strong social side as well. We
congregate in the Union Snack Bar after
every meeting for a coffee and a chat,
and we have frequent to the Red Rose, a
cabaret with a left-wing bias.
Anyone interested in joining the club
should either contact me (Raoul
Mansukhani, Physics 2) v i a the
Undergraduate pigeonholes or come to
one of our committee meetings held
every Tuesday in the Green Committee
R o o m at the top of the Union Building.
