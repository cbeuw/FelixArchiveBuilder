LETTERS
Dear Andy,
I would like to point out that my name
is actually El-Kholy, not El-Choly,
however, considering the length of reply
to A t h , I am in no position to complain
about a minor typo. This is a much
shorter reply, and hopefully one which
would spare me the effort of having to
address people like Ultan McCarthy once
and for all.
First, in reply to A t h , 1 was glad to see
that Ath's letter contained something like
an attempt to address the issue without
the usual inflammatory 'bigoted rantings'.
M y first reaction, however was not to
waste time on a reply since the
arguments presented were so weak as to
demonstrate an almost total ignorance of
the situation in the Middle East. I don't
think that A t h had ever heard the name
Saddam Hussein until August 2. Having
found out that A t h are actually two
neighbours of mine in Southside, I think
my initial judgement was totally justified.
A s for Mr McCarthy, and for anyone
else who is hard of thinking, m y reply
was tongue in cheek. I was merely trying
to point out that any culture can be made
to look 'immature' if judged from a biased
perspective. Not once in m y letter did I
deny that Britain has a long history, and
a culture emulated the world over. I am
not so sure if the British culture is envied
the world over. There are people who
recognise the achievements of this culture
as well as being able to point out its
shortcomings. Let me also remind Mr
McCarthy, that A m e r i c a n culture is widely
adopted the w o r l d over, and that this
does not mean that it is in any way
superior, or for that matter envied.
What Mr McCarthy seems to lack is the
ability to look at the history and culture
of nations from a factual and objective
point of view, instead of his narrow,
nationalistic and bigoted perspective.
A s I have no intention of stooping so
low as to devote any more time to Mr
McCarthy, let me state once and for all,
that I am not a member of the Saddam
Hussein Fan Club, and neither are any of
the students w h o actually k n o w anything
about the Middle East. More than anyone
else, we k n o w the kind of repression
inflicted by this man on the people of his
own country. But there is more to life Mr
McCarthy than a stupid football match
metaphor, or fan clubs, of winning a
losing a game. That is why, the people
w h o oppose the policy of the United
States and all other states w h o take the
high moral ground only when convenient,
cannot be referred to collectively, in the
best bigoted tradition of over-
generalisation, as the Saddam Hussein
Fan Club. I hope you can understand me
M r McCarthy, because, in case you have
not realised yet, you are no more than a
minor irritation to people who are having
to deal with a legacy of disruption,
instability and economical political chaos.
A legacy to w h i c h people like yourself,
when they had the power to do so, made
a major contribution. W e have better
things to do than to answer your letters.
Yours sincerely,
Amin El-Kholy, DoC PG.
