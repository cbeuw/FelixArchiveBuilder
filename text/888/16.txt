Dear FELIX,
Seeing the anti-abortion letters in our
college magazine, I wonder in what spirit
the people w h o wrote them considered
the issues at stake.
Every person has a right to life and a
chance to ensure that their individual
needs for a happy life are fulfilled.
Unfortunately, narrow-minded social
attitudes make single-parenthood difficult
financially and socially. The concept of
sin is used to degrade people, foster an
atmosphere of prejudice and narrow
down freedom of choice. People are
animals, and we need to be able to enjoy
animal pleasures without fear of
embarrassment or degredation. But
people aren't just any kind of animal. A
very high level of organisation of our
consciousness confers personality on us.
Before a certain stage, an embryo or
foetus doesn't have anything like that.
Sad but true, many women, for various
reasons, require an abortion. In countries
where this is difficult to get legally, many
women are driven to illegal abortions as
a last resort, risking their o w n lives.

Ironically, campaigns like 'Pro-Life' are
partly responsible for their death.
A l l those writing against the right to
abortion have invoked God as the
authority justifying their case. But if you
believe in God, who is responsible for
miscarriages? Surely, genuine natural
morality makes us responsible for other

Dear Chris,
As Mr A Bailey is so enraptured with
the 'English Race' and 'English culture'
can he please, for the benefit of
foreigners, define the w o r d 'English'. Does
'English' include the Danes of Angle, the
French of Normandy, the Germans of
Saxony and the Duchy of Orange, not to
mention the Italians led by one Ciaus
Julius Caesar. The very w o r d 'English' is
derived from Anglo-Danish. This mongrel
breeding may well have led to the
creation of an 'Empire', i.e. to totally

people, not to some abstract concept of
piety versus sin. But if y o u believe that
piety is about caring for others, it comes
to the same thing. I hope in the future,
we will make life easier to live, not
harder.
Yours sincerely,

older and, dare I say it, wiser than
'English'.
Sometimes 1 wonder at the wisdom of
my own culture in educating the denizens
of this isle in the arts of writing and
Christianity. Fortunately not all 'English'
people are like Bailey, some, even those
who are not Caucasian, are more
civilised.
