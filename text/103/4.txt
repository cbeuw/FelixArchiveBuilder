GATHERING OF WESTERN EUROPEAN STUDENTS
A detailed account of every event i n
The International Meeting of students
representing u n i v e r s i t y and national unions
from Western Europe was organized^ as i n the
past, by The Teohnische U n i v e r s i t a t , B e r l i n .
There were no p o l i t i c a l , national or student,
ideas behind t h i s meeting, only the exohange
of contacts and ideas on l i f e i n other
u n i v e r s i t i e s .
Considering the economic and p o l i t i c a l
p o s i t i o n of West B e r l i n , an i n t e r e s t i n
the p o l i t i c a l s i t u a t i o n was inevitable. The
West B e r l i n e r s are very aonsoious of t h e i r
p o s i t i o n i n the. Bast ''est relations and
are eager that as many people as possible
from a large range of a c t i v i t i e s and
countries should have the opportunity of be-
coming f a m i l i a r with the unique c i t y and
country of itest B e r l i n .
We stayed i n a Red Cross Hostel i n a
S. Western suburb of the c i t y with f i v e
students of the Aussenreferat, the Council
of the Technische U n i v e r s i t a t . English
was the o f f i c i a l meating language but I
was somewhat dismayed to f i n d with my
meagre knowledge of German,I was the
only Englishman there. The N.U.S. had
not even bothered t o r e p l y t o the
i n v i t a t i o n and made explanations some-
what I d i f f i c u l t .
The programme that had been prepared
struok a f i n e balanoe between the serious
and the d i s t i n c t l y s o c i a l .
The day a f t e r we a r r i v e d we toured
the T.U., which had been destroyed
during the war and i 3 now r e f i t t e d with
the best equipment that the Germans can
obtain. A f i r s t impression i s one of
quiet and space. Students move about
quietly and although there are some
6 0 0 0 students at the T.U., there i s
none of the noise that characterises the
corridors i n I.C.
Next day a f t e r a leoture onthe
p o l i t i c a l s i t u a t i o n i n East Germany,
( i n German) we v i s i t e d the f i n e s t
equipped brewery i n Europe with surely
the most generous management. The l a s t
i n t e l l i g e a b l e comment heard was "Well,
some F i n n i s h student drank 31 of these
b o t t l e s " .
A tour of the Grtine Woche show,
which i s an a g r i c u l t u r a l e x h i b i t i o n
i n West B e r l i n , gave us our f i r s t
glimose of Eastern B e r l i n a r s who were
conspicuous with t h e i r i n f e r i o u r olothess.
and poor shoes. The Easterners are eager
to keep up to date with progress i n a g r i -
culture and t h i s show gives them adequate
opportunity

the packed ten days i n B e r l i n would be
tedious and,for me,perhaps inadvisable,but
many v i s i t s such as one to the Refugee
Camp can never be forgotten. I t was
surely one of the saddest days when we saw
the camp used to house the refugees who are
even now a r r i v i n g at the rate of 3 0 0 a day
from B a s t e r n Zone. To see them i n such
circumstances,with no more belongings
than the clothes they stand i n can mean
only one thingi But there were smiles
on most faces which meant hope and r e l i e f
f o r many of those poor people.
A v i s i t to the Eastern Sector of the
o i t y made i t abundantly apparent why the
seven professors and 100 3tudent 5 that
started the Free University oame to the We3t
i n l?lf7. Now there are 9000 students
studying the Arts and a l l i e d sub jects i n

into the Eastern Sector and i t 1- strange
that i n a matter of three underg •ound
stations the whole nature of l i f e changes.
State owned shops, poor clothes, very
few motorcars, many policemen, aunt very
l i t t l e r e b u i l d i n g are.the f i r s t sights
that characterise the East. There i s an
unusual contrast i n the city, i n that the
S t a l i n A l l e e , a hugh street l i n e d with
Russian type f l a t s and s h o p s , f i l l e d with the
best products that the Russian \>loc oan
producers flanked with shattered and
patched buildings. Due to the exchange
rate, goods i n the shops are very cheap but
Westerners are only allowed book,j and records
which are considered to have a p./opaganda
value. The B r i t i s h passport always gathered
an interested crowd of 3hop assistants who
then t r i e d i n French, German or English to
question me about l i f e i n the West*
A f t e r seeing a p u b l i c i t y f i l m •produced
by the F r e e German Youth i t was sincouraging
t o see that the storm of propaganda and
i n c i d e n t a l pressures that are being applied
to the youth of East Germany i s having l i t t l e
effect. Soon,young Germans who have never
known l i f e i n the normal sense of the word,
i n a family, with freedom of speeah and thought,
w i l l become the leaders of these communist
i n s p i r e d organisations.
At t h i s stage the p o s i t i o n of Eastern
Germany w i l l become c r i t i c a l anc",, the West
Berliners b e l i e v e that, by the jiromotion
of i n t e r n a t i o n a l contacts and »xohange, there
w i l l be b e t t e r understanding. There can be
no doubt that an, internationjj. meeting of
students does much to promote t h i s under-
standing and should continue to be given
our whole hearted support. ^ c h e d w i o k

To l i b e r a t e a l i t t l e steaa from
several o h e s t s , l e t me say the d i r t y word
of the week - St. ps ! B e a u t i f u l ,
s o l i d , new, well-made steps - node f r o a
nie*.,solid, well-seasoned timber iaoortod
at fabulous expense f r o a d o l l a r area
countries to the detriment of our n a t i e a -
~»1 oconoay - constructed by the bands
of h i g h l y paid oarpontors who Bight just
ooncoivably have bean employed i n f i t t i n g
doora to a d r a f t y Union - n i c e , (toady,
p r a o t l e a l , PERMANENT stops. Where ?
From the f l o o r of the Conoert H a l l up to
the contra of the stage - very handy
f o r something or other. But save the
p r a i s e u n t i l you've hoard the purpose —
THEY ARE ONLY TO SERVE AS A PRELIMINARY
"MOCK-UP" FOR THE FINAL MODEL. The
u l t i m a t a reason i s that a set of stops
must bo i n s t a l l e d f o r tha Queen Mother's
v i s i t - but have wo no-one oapable of
approving a design without having i t
b u i l t TWICE ?
The b a t t l e of the b i l l i a r d rooms
i s on - e n t e r p r i s i n g p r i v a t e e r students
secured the cuos from the s t a f f t a b l e
and brought them s a f e l y homo to tha Union
without s k i r m i s h . H.M.S. Sparkes has
since soon a c t i o n and the prize has boon
convoyed back to s t a f f waters - i t i s
thought that a commando aotion may bo
fought any time .... ( t h e y ' l l probably
taka t h o i r cue from a t i p - o f f ) .
Good to see the l i b i d o s boing
a i r e d at the l a s t c a r n i v a l - a moral
(probably the only ono) to be drawn i s
that darkness and a confined space don't
nsc-rtssarily make f o r p r i v a o y l ind
a well-deserved ape-oall to the Minos
f o r breaking up tha shoe-box o u t l i n e of
the present system of standardised
o a r n i v a l ' f l a t s 1
. Memories of th»
days when the H a l l could be 'taken to
pieces' f o r a c a r n i v a l make the present
dvioor seom a l i t t l o tame - but anyone
watching tho teams at work,in a couple
of days,to work a transformation should
bo moved to admiration - or,better
