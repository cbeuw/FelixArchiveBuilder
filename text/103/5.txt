Dear Long-Suffering Editor,
I can think of no reasonwhy you should
wish t o " p r o f i l e " the l a s t Editor of your
par-er. He would have advised you t o "avoid
p r i n t i n g the conventional hut defend our
paper against dishonest w r i t i n g " . A " P r o f i l e "
of "Muggins" Brantley either would'only he
•'Unconventional because i t would be as the
majority of I.G. iam - or i t would be d i s -
honest.
Yours t r u t h f u l l y ,
Hubert. IS. Smith.

A P.G. miner, he
of Mr. Smith - or, as
jwn, John Eramley, - the
ye- know about him:-
been Secretary o f
both Conservative Society and the Mines'
Tennis Club. Eut h i s main a c t i v i t i e s have
always been with FELIX. One of his"potte<'
p r o f i l e s " as a member of the E d i t o r i a l Board
describes him !.s smoking an indescribable
mixture; a t one time he was c a l l e d "Nelson"
because he had t o stand on top of a t a l l
column t o smoke h i s pipe. Ho longer now
on such a pedestal, he has r e t i r e d from
public l i f e . His only i n t e r e s t , apart
from F e l i x , appears t o be h i s fiancee,
S y l v i a .
Not many people know that, on taking
on the :Editorship,, he was faced with the
problem of producing the Freshers, issue of
FELIX almost single-handed. This he success-
f u l l y did, and the r e s u l t was read avidly
by (we hope) every fresher.
. He has done much t o improve the
quality of 'Felixj and cut down production time
on Sundays t o a record figure. The ap-
pearance of the present F e l i x i s c h i e f l y a
result of h i s successful business negoti-
ation.
He s t i l l takes an active interest i n
the paper, and his comments are much
appreciated by the Board. Let us then
leave our Mining E d i t o r Emeritus t o smoke
his pipe i n peace.

The l a s t meeting of Council took place
on February 11th. and lasted f o r about .
hours. The following items of general
interest arose from the meeting.
Dates of Terms
At a previous meeting i t had been decided
to protest t o the Hoard of Studies about the
sudden changes' i n term times which had
occurred t h i s session, causing considerable
confusion i n the f i x t u r e arrangements of
some a t h l e t i c clubs. The Board of Studies
has since produced a set system f o r f i x i n g
these dates which are now known f o r many
years ahead. I t was noted with s a t i s f a c t i o n
that the Christmas term w i l l not extend
30 nearly t o Christmas Day as i t d i d t h i s
year, and Post Office work should be passible
without taking u n o f f i c i a l leave o f absence.
Position of Senior Common Room i n Union
It was unanimously agreed that the
present position of the 3.0.2'. i s a d e f i n i t e
hindrance and a deterrent t o the f u l l use o f
the building i n i t s intended function as a
students' Union. The S.C.R. i n the o l d Union
Union had caused no trouble owing t o i t s
remote position at one end of the building.
The S.C.R. committee have accordingly been
asked t o consider moving the S.C.R, up t o the
small Lounge of the top f l o o r . This would
enable the present S.C.R. and Reading Room
to be l i n k e d as a considerable increase
i n student lounge accomodation. The top
f l o o r lounge i s comparatively remote, and
far fewer students would need t o use the
room as a right-of-way, owing t o the ex-
istence of a l i f t , the S.C.R. would be easily
accessible from the Dining H a l l . I t was
also pointed out that i n view of the excellent
S.C.R. i n the Unwin Building, and the great
difference i n 3taff and.stuuent members, the
S.C.R. committee might consider moving out
of the Union altogether. Any member of
s t a f f who wishes t o i s e the Union can do so
by paying the subscription of three guineas.
There the matter rests u n t i l the next
meeting of the S.G.R. committee. ( I t i s , o f
course,realised that the ^resent S.C.R. would
continue t o be used f o r pre-Dinner sherry i n
the evenings, but there i s no objection t o
that).
Jubilee B a l l , Kay 31st, 9 p.m.-6 a.m.
Four hundred double t i c k e t s , £1 each,
w i l l be on sale before the end of term.
Elaborate security measures w i l l be emplo-
yed t o avoid gate-crashers. The r e l a t i v e
merits of Club hops and Entertainments
Committee *ops were dicussed. The Chairman
of Entertainments i s t o put forward proposals
for a l t e r i n g the Hopping t o the next
Council meeting, and the matter w i l l be
referred t o a Union meeting before being
enforced.
Furniture
It was agreed to press the college
authorities t o furnish the entrance h a l l
of the Unwin-butiding as a lounge, f o r use
by people who lunch i n Ayrton H a l l , and
who have nowhere t o relax afterwards.
The lack of comfort and q u a l i t y o f
the new lounge furniture gave r i s e t o '
considerable dismay, as the Union i s
f i n a n c i a l l y responsible f o r i t s upkeep.
The President was asked to press the
Union Decoration Committee t o devote part o f
i t s remaining funds t o the purchase o f
strong and comfortable furniture f o r
the lounge, the present chairs t o be moved
elsewhere.
Exploration Board
The Exploration Board reported that
arrangements were well under way f o r the
itarakoram Expediter t o take place t h i s
summer; the long-delayed permit t o enter
Kashmir was expected soon. Places, t o be
v i s i t e d i n the near future include
the Gold Coast and The Outer Hebrides;
i n any case, one major expedites would be
arranged every f i v e years to encourage
smaller expeditions.
New Hostels
I t was reported that plans f a r
Princes Gardens were progressing as w e l l
and quickly as red tape would allow, but
the College wished the d e t a i l s t o remain
confidential f o r the time being.
