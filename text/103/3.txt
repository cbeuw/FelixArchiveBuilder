The topic of H a l l Dinner was r a i s e d
several times l a s t term,chiefly i n connection
with block bookings, which were deplored by
many people as being contrary t o the i d e a
of H a l l Dinner; * consequently, blook bookings
were prohibited, and prospective diners were
l i m i t e d t o one guest each. This term, the
popularity of* H a l l Dinner seems t o have de-
clined, and attendances have been unusually
low; at the titLme of going t o press, even the
Wine Dinner on February 26th. i s not f u l l y
booked up!
However, i t appears that even w i t h small
attendance, the attitude of some people t o ,
H a l l Dinner leaves much t o be desired. At the
Dinner l a s t weekjtwo young ladies, i n keeping
with the s p i r i t of H a l l Dinner, decided t o
place themselves next to people they d i d not
know, but from whom they would have the oppor-
t u n i t y of gaining fresh ideas; f o r H a l l Dinner-
i s p r i m a r i l y a s o c i a l function - the excellent
dinner i s merely a d e l i g h t f u l i n c i d e n t a l . So
the l a d i e s placed t h e i r cards i n appropriate
positions and r e t i r e d t o have sherry. On r e t -
urning a f t e r the dinner gong had been sounded,
they found that t h e i r cards had been moved,
and that a party of eight were now seated im
and around.the places. Throughout the evening
the group made no attempt t o converse outsi
themselves. Apart from the bad manners of
these "gentlemen1

having asked the l a d i e s , t h i s c l i q u i s h a t t i t u d e

p r i n c i p l e , whioh i s t o provide an opportunity
f o r s t a f f and students and t h e i r gueste t o
meet on a s o o i a l footing, and a place where
one can meet people w i t h whom one would not
normally come i n t o oontaot.
"v/e wonder whether i t was the same people;
who provoked the writing.of the l e t t e r p u b l i -
shed on t h i s page.
The idea of stopping block«booking was
that socially-minded i n d i v i d u a l s should not
be excluded. Surely I.C. does not oonsist of
recluses and cliques? The only way t o obtair
a f u l l University education i s t o mix with
people - the more people , the b e t t e r - and

Dear S i r ,
I was shocked t o read i n the l a s t issue
that 'Felix' i s a c t i v e l y encouraging the
c u l t i v a t i o n of u n s i g h t l y fungus on our scien-
t i s t s .
Let us please keep our sense of pro-
portion and p o s i t i o n . Such mystical r i t e s
belong over the »«ay i n the H.C.A.
Surely a f a r better idea would have
been t o have a beard shaving race with
cut-throat razors.
However,, I suBpose i t i s too l a t e t o
i t o f f now. Is i t too much t o hope
that, sincej I.C.W.A. i s having a show of
manliness,, we might have a 'Felix'
bathing Vjeauty competition i n the new

Dear S i r ,
Tour correspondent Mr. J.L. "SeUara
obviously has not seen our p e t i t i o n , whioh
was worded, "We, the undersigned, hereby
request that an Extraordinary General
.Meeting of the Imperial College Uhiombe
c a l l e d t o discuss the following motion,
T h a t the beer be transfeaed t o Messrs.
Flowers Ltd." Thia hardly bears out
Mr. S e l l e r s insinuation that one member
of the Union i s taking i t upon himeejf to-
name the brew required i n the bar. We
believe that t h i s matter, whioh *ffeots the
whole Union, should be decided by the
. Union, and not, as your correspondent suggests
"by a smalt notoittee of bar i-eBuls-'-s"-
We ohose Flowers' beer smoe, i n our
opinion, i t i s the best available, and we
wish t o express our thanks t o our venerable
President f o r making i t possible f o r members
of I.C. Union who have never been fortunate
enough t o taste t h i s beer t o do so now.

WHAT MB THE REASONS? WHO ABE RESPONSIBLE?.
Dear S i r ,
Critioisms upon c r i t i o i s m s are p i l e d i n your
columns against the new Union. I think that i f
the reasons f o r the most provocative features
are given, then perhaps the volume of
complaints w i l l be suppressed.
Very often a c r i t i c i s m of bad taste does not
a r i s e i f the underlying functional need i s
understood. For example,how many know that tht
neurotic yellow i n the tower Dining H a l l was
an idea i n order t o supplement the l i g h t that
does not come through the small windows.
To my mind, three things may be happening;
1. The designers of the new.building have l e f t
oollege and are nowhere to be found.
2. Nobody designed anything.
3. The g e n i i (or geniuses) responsible f o r the
shape of things that came are e i t h e r a f r a i d or
oould not oare t o defend t h e i r designs.
This b o i l s down t o voices shouting i n the
desert and i t i s quite pathetio - exoept of
course i f treated a3 a b i g joke.
So l e t those who have had a f i n g e r i n , i t
defend t h e i r brightest ideas, as now, as i n any
case, i t i s too l a t e t o do anything else.
Such explanations w i l l make i n s t r u c t i v e
reading and , i f nothing else w i l l change
F e l i x ' s appearance.
Yours E x t r a o r d i n a r i l y ,

At a recent H a l l Dinner we notided
several people who were more informally
dressed than i s usual; i n blazers, ooloured
s h i r t s , and polo-necked sweaters.
I t i s no s i n t o leak a lounge s u i t ,
but surely f o r the more formal of the
college functions every endeavour should be
made t o be suitably dressed.

No doubt, a subject such as 'The Freedom
of the Press' deserves a somewhat elevated
treatment i n keeping w i t h i t s importance, but
the defence of such tfreedom would appear t o
be superfluous, when the press, i f heard,
cannot be understood.
Should i t be considered desirable f o r
the present state of incomprehensibility t o
