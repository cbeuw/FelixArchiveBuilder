GLOBALLY SPEAKING environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Saturday saw over 20 Imperial stu-
dents flock to Malet Street to join
the student branch of the ‘I Count’
climate campaign, organised by
People and Planet. 2,000 students
took part, joining the 22,000 already
in Trafalgar Square to listen to the
likes of Miranda Richardson, Si-
mon Amstell and Ashok Sinha, the
Director of the Stop Climate Chaos
Coalition talk about their fears and
ideas about climate change.
The I Count campaign calls on
both individuals and politicians to
do their bit to reduce our impact on
the environment and the climate.
Their main aims are to call on the
government to:
•Take a lead on the global stage,
working for an international agree-
ment to cut climate pollution.
World-wide this must be in decline
by 2015.
•Cut the UK’s emissions by at
least 3% year on year.
•Help the poorest countries get

Climate rally hits the spot
Embracing the power of switching off
access to clean energy, help them
cut out poverty and deal with the
climate disasters they are already
facing.
The rally was timed to co-ordi-
nate with the forthcoming interna-
tional talks on climate change in
Kenya where delegates will try to
find ways to widen the UN’s Kyoto
Protocol, capping emissions of
greenhouse gases by 35 industrial
nations until 2012.
Over a decade ago, most coun-
tries joined an international treaty
- the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) - to begin to consider
what can be done to reduce global
warming and to cope with whatever
temperature increases are inevita-
ble. Recently, a number of nations
have approved an addition to the
treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which
has more powerful (and legally
binding) measures. However, this
is no guarantee of government ac-
tion on climate change. The UNFC-
CC secretariat supports all institu-
tions involved in the climate change
process, particularly the COP
, the
subsidiary bodies and their Bureau
(UNFCC.int).
Hopes were high among cam-
paigners that their voice will make
a difference but only time will tell.

Recycling
Have you seen the bins
for recycling around col-
lege? Re-think your rub-
bish, and don’t be brash
with your trash!
Saving electricity
Energy production is the
greatest contributor to
carbon dioxide emis-
sions. Turning off lights
you don’t need could
save 370kg of carbon!
Face your Elephant
In your lifetime you will
discard over 31,000
drinks cans, drive more
than 722,000 miles, and
flush away 119.1km of
toilet paper. This is your
own personal carbon
elephant, and it’s time
you confronted it.
Four wheel drives
These gas-guzzling,
sloane-mummy carrying,
carbon-emitting mobile
factories are going to
be taxed beyond belief!
Hurrah for that. However,
some will argue that
the divide between the
rich and the poor will
increase exponentially.

It will probably come as no surprise
to most that leaving appliances
on standby uses a considerable
amount of energy. According to the
Energy Saving Trust (EST), 10% of
the UK’s electricity bills (about £300
million a year, or £37 per household)
is used by TVs, VCRs, and DVD
players left on standby. This doesn’t
take into account all the other cul-
prits including mobile chargers,
laptop cables, stereos, and wash-
ing machines along with many oth-
ers. Extra energy usage results in
increased carbon emissions, a gas
that has been shown to contribute
to the greenhouse effect and con-
sequently a global climate change.
The EST estimates that DVDs and
VCRs produce more than a million
tons of CO2 annually . While manu-
facturers can considerably reduce
the standby power of an appliance,
few do so despite a new voluntary
EU initiative.
So what can we do about it? Any
steps individuals take will add to
the solution rather than the prob-
lem, as well as saving on household
energy bills. For example, if every
standby button on TV sets and vid-
eos in the UK were switched off we
would save the power equivalent to
the annual output of a large power
station. And, if every household
changed just two ordinary light
bulbs for energy efficient ones it
would save enough electricity each
year to power all the street lighting
in the UK. The steps are small but
the impact could be huge. Other
tips from the EST include:
1. Turning your thermostat down
by 1ºC could cut your heating bills
by up to 10 per cent and save you
around £40 per year.
2. If you’re not filling up the wash-
ing machine, tumble dryer or dish-
washer, use the half-load or econo-
my programme
3. Only boil as much water as you
need (but remember to cover the
elements if you’re using an electric
kettle).
4. Always turn off the lights when
you leave a room.
Imperial College’s Environmen-
tal Society is currently planning
its second Green Week; this year’s
theme is Energy and the measures
both the college, its staff and stu-
dents can take to reduce their en-
ergy usage including promoting the
‘Power of Off’. If you’re interested
in getting involved, in any area be
it publicity, planning, design or just
being an extra pair of hands during
the week email ic.esoc@gmail.com
and we’ll welcome you onboard!
