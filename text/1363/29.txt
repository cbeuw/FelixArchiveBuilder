Picture the scene: Friday evening
at Imperial, the library’s empty and
the union is dead. But in the Sher-
field building, something amazing
is happening.
The Wye Fashion Society is
putting on a show, and there are
more beautiful people in the Great
Hall than it has seen all year.
Showing collections by eight dif-
ferent designers, the show aimed
to raise money for the development
charity World Vision, as well as
bring a little glamour to Imperial.
Models were exclusively recruit-
ed from Imperial, and clothes and
accessories from a range of men
and women’s designers, many of
whom were influenced by African
patterns and material.
My favourites included the gor-
geous jackets from Jewels by Lisa,
the twisted copper and amber neck-
laces by Zovala, and a cute slash-
backed dress with Victorian lace by
Arrogant Cat, which was auctioned
off to one very lucky guest.
The organisers did an amazing
job; other auctioned items included
a box at an Arsenal match for eight
people and a digital camcorder, and
it all went towards raising a lot of
money for World Vision.
There was live music throughout
the evening, and dancing from a
group of Imperial students.
The show ended with a collection
of World Vision t-shirts adapted
by Mr King Apparel, which were
modelled to the tones of the gos-
pel group IDMC, who got everyone
up and dancing. It was a fantastic
night’s entertainment, and I sin-
cerely hope the society does anoth-
er sometime soon.
